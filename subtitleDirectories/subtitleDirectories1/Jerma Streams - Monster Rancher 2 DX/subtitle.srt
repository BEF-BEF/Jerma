1
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,099
Is this game out yet? Is the game released yet? 430? No? Shit.

2
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:46,040
Where the fuck did this game come out? Real voice? What? What's wrong?

3
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,579
Maybe in 30 minutes? Alright, well what? Okay, so fuck.

4
00:01:52,579 --> 00:02:00,730
Hey, first of all, hello. Hi everybody. How you doing? Good to see you again.

5
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:08,360
Today, plan is we're going to play Monster Rancher 2.

6
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,120
Trying to hold my excitement. This is one of my favorite games ever.

7
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,909
Fart on the mic. You got it. Why do so many people want streamers to fart in mics?

8
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,900
Is it funny? Oh, I saw a clip. I've completely forgot it. But let's talk about this real quick.

9
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:34,099
I completely forgot that. So during the dollhouse stream, there was a lot going on.

10
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:39,860
There was a lot of stuff that we recorded, right? Like the costume selection stuff, right? That was

11
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,539
all pre-recorded. And then there was stuff going on on the set. And my mind was not like watching

12
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,620
the stream and I completely forgot. And it took until I like, I like reminded of this like weird

13
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,500
thing where I spun around in the middle of the costume change scene and like do this like fake

14
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:03,900
spin fart loud into the microphone thing with my mouth. And I had a reaction to that like a few

15
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,659
months ago. Then I forgot about it. And I saw it like a few days ago. And I was like, I why is that

16
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,770
in the why is it here? I like didn't want that in the video. What is just there? I didn't want

17
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:27,590
that in the stream. But anyways, who cares? Let us see your face. I know I told you I'm sitting here

18
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,189
waiting for the release of Monster Rancher. And I'm gonna play Monster Rancher 2. And by the way,

19
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:39,620
who cares? I do. It was my fart for all the new germamites that are in attendance right now.

20
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:46,729
I played this game before. This is a re-release of the old PlayStation 1 games.

21
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:55,669
I can't I'm so excited. I can't wait to play. We be prepared to be more emotionally invested

22
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:07,340
in this than anything else you've ever done in your life with the microphone. No emotion for an

23
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:14,710
hour. I feel like I'm sitting in the line at Best Buy waiting for the new iPhone. I just want to

24
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:23,100
play. All right, hold on. Do I just do no emotion until the game comes out? Why did this turn into

25
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,339
like a weird like protest stream? I'm not I'm not like protesting the game. I know I'm I'm just

26
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:44,089
waiting for the game to come out. Turn on the cam and smoke cigarettes. I don't want to talk about

27
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:48,089
too much about the game because I want you to be surprised by how fun it is. Apparently the port's

28
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:54,089
pretty good too from what I've heard. It's almost 3am. Yeah, what time is it? When is it? Okay,

29
00:04:54,089 --> 00:05:01,430
when is the next region midnight? Does anybody know? Like where is it 11.35 right now?

30
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:12,170
If you look at your clock and if it's 11.35 p.m. tell me where you are. What region? Ireland,

31
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:23,100
it's 12.35. Okay, so what is this? What is this release? It's 1am. 11.35 where? Oh, it's 11.35am.

32
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,779
That's not right. No, I'm talking general region. Region. It's 11.35am in Australia. I'm looking for

33
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:38,329
regions. It's not even out yet. I know. So look just fucking okay whatever. Ask ask me ask me

34
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:53,939
whatever you want. Okay, I'm fine. I'm sitting here till it comes out. Whole Europe is after zero zero.

35
00:05:53,939 --> 00:06:11,480
You look unhealthy. Somebody said that. I did. I can I can I can stall as long as I want. Don't

36
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,759
you believe in time zones? I do believe in time. You know okay you're asking the guy if he believes

37
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,120
in time zones. The guy that has to respond to the EU viewers that yell at him because I stream too

38
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:34,680
late. You're talking to that guy. You don't think I know time zones? Seriously, what is this time?

39
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,529
I don't know. I'm waiting for Monster Rancher to come out. It probably doesn't even come out.

40
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:52,699
It's probably like an error on Steam that the game comes out like today. It says on Steam that the

41
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:58,790
game releases in less than an hour and that was an hour ago. That was at like that was at four o'clock.

42
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:17,269
What's your skincare routine? My eyes! You look you look greasy. Thanks. Oh you guys. Hey I'll

43
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:23,180
show you something interesting. I'll show you something interesting. Okay so this is my I had

44
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,579
to do this today. I had to put on a t-shirt. I had to put a shirt on today. Your tags are inaccurate.

45
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:41,290
What do you mean? No pants. Well no I do have pants on but this this is like the I'm in a zoom

46
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,410
call professional Andy. Just make sure uh just make sure you don't stand up so they see your

47
00:07:46,410 --> 00:08:01,100
Darth Vader pajama pants. Look at this. Oh look. What's up guys? Yeah v-neck. I got a I got a cool

48
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:14,709
v-neck on. Don't stand up otherwise they'll know. You have one of the three shirts you own. I need

49
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:20,470
to go close. I look can I can let I have to talk about this. Listen to me. I need to know if anybody

50
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:31,029
else relates to this. So I have I have I don't like okay I own a shit load of really nice clothes

51
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:35,909
that I've purchased. I bought a bunch of clothing. I went to a bunch of nice places. Bought a bunch of

52
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:42,470
nice like tees. Really nice like button-up shirts and shit right. They are all wrinkled to fucking

53
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,629
hell in the closet. I have not worn them once because I don't want to mess them up. I don't

54
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:53,259
want to ruin them. I always feel like if I put my nice clothes on I have a bunch of it that I I will

55
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:59,379
somehow like sweat through it or drop mustard on it or something. I never want to wear those clothes.

56
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:06,820
I don't know why and they they seriously look like they look like they're in a vacuum sealed

57
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,980
bag because of how fucked up and scrunched and wrinkled they are. I don't think any dry

58
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,710
cleaning would work. I think I literally have to get new clothes because they're so wrinkled up.

59
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:23,379
This is not going to happen. I tried to iron one of them once and all it did was make make like

60
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:32,220
a bunch of lines and it was bad. In the pre-stream you promised Mario Golf. I was shit faced when I

61
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:43,429
promised Mario Golf like six months ago. So sorry. What'd you say? Don't eat mustard then. How often

62
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:48,230
are you eating mustard? Are you wearing really nice clothes to a ball game? No I don't know. I

63
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,710
always just feel like okay I feel like I sweat a lot and like I'm gonna get those like orange stains

64
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:02,809
under the nice clothes. What causes those orange stains by the way? It doesn't happen to me but if

65
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:16,389
it did what is why does that happen? Game out yet? I'm in the wrong category too. Yeah I gotta move

66
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:23,049
to like just chatting for like 20 minutes or wait is it is it technically a Monster Rancher 2 stream

67
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:28,340
if I'm talking about how pumped and hyped I am for Monster Rancher 2? You look red. I know

68
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:42,419
I'm very flustered. Why is you sweat orange? No it's after when it dries. It's aluminum.

69
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:51,059
It's an allergic reaction huh. Derma you still owe me four million dollars for stealing and

70
00:10:51,059 --> 00:11:00,500
crashing my jetpack. Jetpacks aren't real. Why do you look so nice today? Who did you kill for the

71
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:19,049
youth today? I shaved. So I killed the millions of tiny little hairs that were on my face I'd say.

72
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:28,820
You look 15 years young. Guess I shaved my face. This is a fresh shave. How come you're de-aging?

73
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:36,679
I'm not de-aging. I'm this is just what my face looks like after I shave. I could use a haircut

74
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:45,580
too. Your face looks red. I know because my white balance is wrong and it's like I'm a little warm.

75
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,500
My white balance is screwed up. This wall this wall is not like green okay. It's it's like white.

76
00:11:51,500 --> 00:12:07,299
It's kind of like a off-white. This chat's going too fast. What's on the reddit shelf?

77
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,500
Uh on the reddit shelf we have I've kind of been doing a little collection here so I'll move this

78
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,799
way. Uh every major stream people have maybe been paying attention to this but every major stream a

79
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,980
prop like a little piece of it goes up there and eventually I wanted to get to the point where

80
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:34,230
all those Funko pops get removed. I'm gonna start replacing the Funko pops with like one little prop

81
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:41,799
from a major stream. So hopefully over the next year or two that shelf is fucking overflowing.

82
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,700
It's like it's a nice I don't know it's a nice little reminder like walk in and be like oh yeah

83
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,340
that one that one that was fun that was fun that was fun that was fun.

84
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:58,600
The geodes there yeah most of them all the major streams the big event streams are up there with

85
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:07,929
the exception of maybe maybe I don't know maybe one. He's holding on to the past. No I would be

86
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:15,129
holding on to the past if this was like 30 years from now and I come in and I pick up the 985 plaque

87
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:31,049
and I'm like oh I remember when I did that oh it's it happened like six months ago. Remember when

88
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:38,139
what was your favorite stream? I don't have a favorite. Game out yet? No. You need to get the

89
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:44,490
Deathwing Funko pop. Why would I do that? I don't give a shit about that game. I don't care at all

90
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:52,440
about Deathwing. Why would I ever get the Deathwing Funko pop? I haven't played World of Warcraft

91
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:01,850
since I swore off of it like six years ago when you watched the Meltdown stream. What did you say?

92
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:15,610
Do a cool camera effect. No I we have 15 minutes before I can I hope it unlocks. Okay this is like

93
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,419
me waiting for the iPhone at Best Buy except Best Buy didn't tell me didn't say anything about

94
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:27,830
what time the iPhone was coming out. I'm just here. Excuse me sir we never we didn't like tell

95
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,669
you that like the game was the the iPhone was going to be out today. Yeah I'm just here I'm

96
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:38,940
gonna wait for it. What if it's like three weeks from now? Yeah that's that's fine I'll just like

97
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:47,320
I'll just hang out. Well how do you like McDonald's? I love McDonald's. Remember how's TikTok treating

98
00:14:47,320 --> 00:15:11,059
you? You tell me. What's my favorite bug? Praying mantis probably. Yeah we're doing the game awards

99
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:20,980
tomorrow. Absolutely. That's also at 4 30. Hopefully that actually starts at 4 30. Do I have any

100
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:28,299
vinyls? No I don't have any vinyls. And what hold on what's what's going on here? I need to make

101
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:37,450
sure something here. Should I just switch to just chatting like I'm just sitting here? I'm not going

102
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:46,539
to sit in the wrong category for like fucking an hour. Don't no more swearing either. Just chatting

103
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:55,539
return to the farm. Whatever that means. I swear to god if I change category and it comes out in

104
00:15:55,539 --> 00:16:02,389
two minutes I'm gonna be mad. Now all right if it doesn't come out at five then I will just leave

105
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:18,259
this category. If it isn't ready can you play the Manos hands of fate game? No no thank you. Do

106
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:25,879
something wacky? Um I don't think these pants will allow me to do that. I could give you a TikTok

107
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:34,330
though. You want to talk about world's greatest TikToker? Yeah I could prove it to you. Can I

108
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,909
stand up? This is not inappropriate right? There's a pair of pants with I have underwear on. Why do

109
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:45,590
you have to ask that? Why do I have to even say that? I sometimes forget how many people I'm

110
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,379
talking to. My mother's pissed probably. She's probably like Jeremy. I just heard my mother's

111
00:16:50,379 --> 00:17:00,539
voice go Jeremy. TikTok fine. You want to see the next fucking big TikTok dance? I'll give it to you

112
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:09,859
right now. All right fine. Okay I've trended on TikTok three different times in the last fucking

113
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:22,390
three years. Bring this one to the fucking front page. Oh this one the goddamn orangutan. See on

114
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:44,660
the front page. Holy shit it's already gone viral. It's already viral. I didn't even do it. I just

115
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:57,640
did that for five seconds. You think I could be on TikTok.com? What the fuck did that guy do?

116
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:07,319
That's the latest TikTok craze. It's called the orangutan. You keep talking just make it already.

117
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:24,900
I'm not gonna make a TikTok. Jerma I would, Jerma I would rather see you in the hospital

118
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:43,210
than on TikTok. Holy shit dude. What the fuck? Can you be toxic? Sure fine. No I don't do that.

119
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:58,009
I'm too excited. By the way, important, the New Year's Eve nominations are still open.

120
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:05,369
Still open. If you have something this year that you thought was really awful or really cool,

121
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:16,490
go to the Discord. I'm winded from doing the, it's a tough dance. We've got 10 minutes until I have

122
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:25,180
to panic and figure out what the hell I'm gonna do for the next few hours. Be funny. I just did

123
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:41,700
the orangutan and that was fucking hilarious. Don't you remember? This is why I shouldn't

124
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,539
ever fucking go live unless I exactly am ready to stream the game. You guys that's why I don't

125
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:51,859
do like IRL is because I can't be trusted with anything. That was trendy but it wasn't funny.

126
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,039
That was trendy. Why am I so red? Why? Dude I don't understand. Why do I have so much blood in my skin?

127
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:16,059
Why am I like this? I don't think I really am though. Does that mean I have too much blood

128
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:23,099
all over my whole face and shit? What does that mean? You're regressing to 2011 Jerma. Yeah the

129
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:32,859
Jerma that was red in every video. But I was burnt. That was burnt. I don't know why I decided

130
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:42,819
to turn the face cam on and do videos when I was just burnt every time. Was it? We've seen the

131
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:55,049
orangutan but can we see the... I don't know what that is. You're very sweaty. I'm not, I'm real,

132
00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:08,809
I'm not though. I'm just red. Nine minutes. Nine minutes. Remain. Why is your bed on the floor

133
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:16,710
behind you? That's a dog bed. Or that could be very far away, right? What if I just freaked everybody

134
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,190
out right now and I got up and I started running and walking towards that and I started getting

135
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:28,630
smaller and like five minutes later I get in that bed and lie in it like I'm this big. That would

136
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:38,819
have been hilarious. Jerma it comes out tomorrow but look at Steam. I'm telling you look at Steam

137
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:48,700
says the game releases in less than an hour. It said 23 hours an hour ago. This is not copium.

138
00:21:48,700 --> 00:22:03,190
This is factual information on the Steam website. It's gonna be five. I think so. You're already

139
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,460
fitting that perfectly. I, I gotta fix this. I don't know why I'm so red. I'm like, I'm like

140
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:20,819
turning purple. Am I or is that just my shitty monitor? I can't, I have no idea. You're bruising

141
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:28,700
because your lights are too blue. Let me, let me see what I can do. Hold on. Bear with me here.

142
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:49,660
Okay. White balance. Let's change it. Oh there we go. I'm actually like blue now. I don't, why am I,

143
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:58,890
I don't, do I even have human skin? Why is it like so hard for me to white balance my face?

144
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:09,019
I don't get it. I promise I'm not like this like red and purple. I've made like videos on

145
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:16,700
TikTok before. I'm not this red and purple. Why do I have so much blood? I don't know.

146
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:30,740
I don't know. Six minutes until we don't get to play the game. He's so scary. I'm,

147
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,019
all right, give me some questions. This is supposed to be an ask me anything before Monster,

148
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,740
ask me anything about Monster Rancher. How does that sound? Because this is a Monster Rancher 2

149
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:50,380
stream. What does your mouth look like an optical illusion image? Like the ones with Obama where

150
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:57,130
one version's facial features are upside down. I don't know. My cells split like differently in

151
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:04,619
the womb. I don't know. I have no idea what you mean. That was actually kind of funny.

152
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:10,059
All right, what'd you say? You're still going to play the Monster Breeder? Yes.

153
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:20,420
You like Ranch? Not really. It's okay. How old were you when you first played Monster Rancher?

154
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:31,700
Now that is a good question. I believe I was 13, 14, PlayStation 1. I loved it. They replaced

155
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:38,950
the CD system. I am not going to give a judgment on it until I play it in approximately five minutes.

156
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:51,059
What are your thoughts on Honey Mustard? I love it. Why do you look like that? Why do you, why do

157
00:24:51,059 --> 00:25:08,839
you look like that? Is this 2D or 3D? It's 3D. Why is your face red in Monster Rancher? When was the

158
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:20,359
last time that you touched grass with your fingertips? Does soil count? Like does dirt count?

159
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:29,140
Because I've done a bunch of stuff with plants over the last like few months. That should count.

160
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:42,730
Four minutes. When I drink that's a nice coffee. What'd you say? Why did I see you blink like a

161
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:49,420
reptile two minutes ago? I don't know. I'm really blinky. I'm really blinky and I lick my lips all

162
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:58,869
the time. So maybe I am a lizard. I don't know. Your straw is longer than your forearm. Holy shit.

163
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:09,589
This is huge. This is, this is huge. Why is this so huge? Oh my god. How are you, why are you so

164
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:21,559
perceptive? What? It's, it is fucking gigantic. What? This is probably for like a 40 ounce drink.

165
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:24,839
I actually, I'm really happy about it though because I don't have to like move. I can just

166
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:32,140
go like this. Takes too long to get to your mouth. No it doesn't. Perpetual

167
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:43,000
kinetic energy gets it there faster. Am I, I'm not even that red. It's just a shitty monitor.

168
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:55,980
How many people are in here? There's like almost 12,000 people here. Is it out? Your straw is as

169
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:10,309
long as an oil pipeline. Play a game already. I'm so, I hope this releases in three minutes.

170
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:22,069
Please release in three minutes. What'd you say? Are you hip with the kids? Talk to me in an hour

171
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:26,230
when the orangutan is trending on the front page of the app where you cannot be over the age of 35

172
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:56,740
to use it. That's an ego, egotistical. What the? This monitor is, you know what? It is this monitor.

173
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,390
Remember when I thought that like a green like vegetable was gray or something? Because this

174
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:20,460
monitor's colors are all screwed up. Two minutes! Yo dude, where's my door dash order? I don't know.

175
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:39,289
Why would I know that? There's a bug on my face. Good. Okay. 60 seconds, come on! Come on, come on,

176
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:44,890
Monster Rancher. Monster Rancher 2. If we all say it collectively at the same time,

177
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:52,890
it's going to happen. Ready? Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2. Monster

178
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:59,539
Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2. Come on! Monster Rancher 2. Louder! Monster Rancher 2. In the back!

179
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:08,279
Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2. I feel like I'm at a camp. I feel as enthusiastic. Monster

180
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:29,829
Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2. Monster, come on! This game will, it just says coming soon now.

181
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:57,509
That's, wait, that's normal? It's normal? Somebody said that's normal. Does that mean it's like about

182
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:13,240
to come out? Like right now? Restart Steam. Is it out? It's out? Restart Steam. All right,

183
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:41,369
I'm gonna restart Steam. Oh shit, it's out. This deserves an orang attack! It's not even out! Where

184
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:57,000
is it? I just, are you lying to me? Come on, it's out! Install it already. Somebody says yikes.

185
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:14,170
No, it's out. It's out. It's out. Come on. Holy shit, I can't wait. Fucking install it!

186
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:30,329
Hurry up and install it! Come on! Dude, you need to chill. Yeah, I know. Dude, the iPhone just came

187
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:43,779
out. The iPhone just came out and I'm in line to get the iPhone. Are you on meth? That's fucking

188
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:48,839
funny. We did a drug test like a year or two ago and the only thing that came up was cocaine. So

189
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:59,210
like, I mean, that person's fucking wrong. Why can't, come on, download. Wait a minute, hold on a

190
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:14,150
second. Why is this fucked up? Shit. All right, hold on. I'm restarting it again. I don't do

191
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:20,460
fucking drugs, guys. Marijuana is the only thing I've ever done. I drink alcohol like six times a

192
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:35,859
year. Come on. Is it installing? Oh dude, here it goes. All right, my stream might crash because I

193
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:40,119
can't like do two things at once. I might be downloading too fast. Let's see, tell me if the

194
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:55,079
stream crashes. I can't wait. I'm so happy. I get to play Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 2.

195
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:06,220
Monster Rancher 2. How do my headphones in? All right, open it. Turn the volume down in case it's

196
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:18,650
too loud. I'm opening it for the first time. It actually is out. It was really loud. Can you hear

197
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:31,480
this? That's so loud. I got scared. Turn this, turn it down. There's no audio for you. Okay, well,

198
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,420
there is now. I'm sorry. I just made it loud for you. That was my fault. All right, Monster Rancher

199
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:49,160
2. Monster. This is, I got to go to the options here. Sound on. What is it? FF. FF? Resolution

200
00:33:49,160 --> 00:34:07,190
settings. Here we go. I want a full screen. Full screen. Oh shit, I didn't have a controller. Okay,

201
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:20,809
I got a controller. Stop. Let's chill. Gonna fucking hang out. Play Monster Rancher 2. It's a

202
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:26,820
fucking pretty fun game, dude. Minimize the face cam. I have to make sure the game works first.

203
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:35,349
Why can't this? Full screen. I want it full screen. I don't know what FF is, but I'm just gonna say

204
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:46,019
okay. Confirm. I don't think that did anything. Oh Jesus, I don't know what's going on. Okay,

205
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:51,530
hold on. Let me capture it. Oh shit, this is, I can't wait. This is fucking unbelievable.

206
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:15,769
All right, so listen to me. I can't fucking wait, dude. There it is. I just looked so pretend

207
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:29,699
interesting. I'll do face cam for 10 minutes and it's never going on ever again. What happened

208
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:43,289
to my hair? Why does my hair look so like fluffy and weird? Okay, here we go. So if you guys don't

209
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:46,889
know anything about Monster Rancher, let's talk about it very, very quickly, very briefly.

210
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:56,940
Monster Rancher, where'd it go? Where'd it go? Why isn't it being captured? What just happened?

211
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:18,920
What the fuck is going on? What happened? Why is it doing this? All right, I want to do new game.

212
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:39,639
Why is this not showing up? It was just, you guys just saw it, right? There it is. You ready?

213
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:47,480
Monster Rancher is a monster training and battle simulation game. This game takes place over the

214
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,519
course of a few years, I think five to 10 years on your ranch. And what happens is you get these

215
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:59,159
monsters, you can breed them and you fight in battles. And it's way better than Pokemon. Okay,

216
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:07,429
Pokemon is not even close. Neither is digital monsters either. So what's going to happen here

217
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:15,849
is I'm going to get into the game. I'm so fucking excited. Let's go. Please sign your name here.

218
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,550
No, matches are open to public view. Do not include any personal info or offensive

219
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:35,849
wording. Some words made up. Wait, there's online in this? Holy shit, really? All right, what's my

220
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:49,210
name? What should it be? I don't have to hurry up. Dean Baxon. This is not the name of my monster.

221
00:37:49,210 --> 00:38:05,530
This is the trainer. I feel like there's a significant amount of lag. Okay, this is important.

222
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:18,739
How about Jaxxus Cole? Sus guy is not going up there. The orangutan. No, there are orangutans in

223
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:24,340
the game though. A lot of you new viewers, I have no idea just how fucking cool this game is. I'm

224
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,219
able to change your whole life. We've played this before a few years ago. It's one of my favorite

225
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:34,420
games. You're about to experience one of the coolest fucking games ever made. And I'm dead

226
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:50,170
serious about that. Pay attention. All right, it's just Jeremy. Jeremy. No, Jaxx is fine.

227
00:38:50,170 --> 00:39:04,199
Why is it X? What's with the X? How do I? That's interesting. Should I use the keyboard and mouse?

228
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:20,489
That's the wrong X. How is it wrong? Jaxx, you will be a new trainer, right? We're going to have to

229
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:28,150
take, you're gonna have to learn and type the test. Please answer these questions. I have never lied

230
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:38,489
in my entire life. Uh, I have, I lie all the time. The effort I put forth in reaching my goal is more

231
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:50,389
important than the outcome. That depends. That depends. I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, can I just,

232
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:58,820
can I click the thing in the middle? I'm gonna say yes. My dream can be realized as long as I do my

233
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:09,320
best to achieve it, but also luck at like right place, right time. And yeah, I don't know. I gotta,

234
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:29,530
I gotta click the one in the middle. It's 90% luck. You're a millionaire. Just say yes. If I have to

235
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:37,699
choose, I like spring better than winter. No way, dude. Before I start proceeding with something,

236
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:51,269
I should make sure it's safe. But it's safe how? Like safe physical danger or safe like out of my

237
00:40:51,269 --> 00:41:03,530
comfort zone. I'm gonna say no. In a battle, what counts in the end is mental power. Um, unless the

238
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:22,710
person has a gun. When I'm ordered to do something I like, I'm confused. What does that mean? When

239
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:31,849
I'm ordered to do something I like, I'm confused. I don't think, I don't think so. I, I think it's

240
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:35,909
like that. I'm like surprised. Like, oh, this is cool. If someone does something displeasing,

241
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:42,340
I should not behave the same way. Yeah, I'm not, if somebody's doing something doesn't mean you do

242
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:53,929
it. When I am absorbed in something, I don't notice what's going on around me. Yes. In order

243
00:41:53,929 --> 00:42:00,380
to truly succeed, sometimes I need to make a risky choice. Yes, absolutely. But have backup

244
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:15,530
plans. That's all, thank you very much. Please wait here for a while. I'm, I can't fucking wait,

245
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:21,739
dude. You guys have no idea how fun this game is. Hello Jax, thank you for waiting. I was explaining

246
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:29,960
the type of trainer you are to the trainer assistant. Uh, I am a trainer assistant. Oh yeah,

247
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:41,659
okay. I remember the exam pass date, the exam score a little bit hasty. Okay. This is the trainer.

248
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:48,780
This is the trainer that I have for help. She is the trainer assistant who is going to your place.

249
00:42:48,780 --> 00:43:01,940
She is still a bit childish, but she sure is a good girl. Here she is. Coltia. How do you do Jax?

250
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:11,219
I'm Coltia. Please call me Colt. You're going to work with her for quite some time.

251
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:18,809
So please try to get along with each other. Do your best to raise a monster well so that it can

252
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:28,460
win the major four. Way better than Pokemon. I'm looking forward to your performance. That's my

253
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:34,260
opinion, right? My opinion is that I think this is better than Poke, Pokemon. That's my opinion.

254
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,139
You might have a different opinion. Your opinion could be different than mine and that's okay.

255
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:48,570
Yes, sir. Well, Jax, let's do our best. First, you should obtain a monster at the market in the

256
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:56,969
town or at the shrine by generating it from a disk stone or a slate and then take it with you

257
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:05,190
to the ranch. How this game worked back in the day is there was a certain code that was embedded

258
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:10,980
onto every CD and DVD that you owned and it would pull a random piece of data from that. For instance,

259
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:17,130
I put Adam Sandler's Click in when we played this a few years ago and you get a specific monster to

260
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:24,039
that disk. Obviously now CDs don't exist anymore, so I don't know what the hell they're going to do.

261
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,039
I guess now there's like a gigantic database where you can look up your favorite songs and

262
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:35,269
movies or something. I don't know. I wonder how it works. We'll find out. But it was really fun

263
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:43,989
because I got like 40 just random CDs and DVDs and we just generated monsters and the monster

264
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:48,119
will always be the same for that disk. It can be a million different combinations, although it's

265
00:44:48,119 --> 00:45:00,730
probably like way less than that, but it's a lot. Thank you. Did you see that information there?

266
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:07,340
I'm still a rookie here and Jax, you too have just become a trainer, right? Is there anything

267
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:18,940
you would like to ask about? I know everything there is to know. I've already played this game.

268
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:25,369
Are you done? Yes. And let's go find our monster. We're going to get a default monster. We're going

269
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:31,300
to get our Squirtle. We're going to get our Charizard or one of the plant stones back.

270
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:40,260
So wait, should we go to the shrine? Excuse me. Is this your first time visiting the shrine?

271
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:50,519
What's your name? My name is Colt. This is Jax, a trainer. I am Chally, a priestess of the shrine.

272
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:57,590
We generate monsters using disk stones and slates, backup data of Monster Rancher. So this is like

273
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:07,219
save game and stuff, right? What do you want to generate? A disk? How does this work? Disk stone?

274
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:18,739
Uh, I wonder how this works. The music is... I'm so excited. I am too. Here comes DMC. I don't...

275
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:26,360
No, hold on. Where is it? I don't think it actually plays the music. It definitely doesn't play the

276
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:36,980
music. Oh shit. What am I doing? How can we get... Wait, what did I do? Oh, okay. So what should I look

277
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:49,510
up? Oops. The title of the song or an artist? Cautions? All right, how about just something

278
00:46:49,510 --> 00:47:05,400
simple? Okay. How about Crazy Frog? Does that exist? There's no search result. Please change

279
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:23,340
the conditions. There is no crazy frog. Toxic. Uh, toxic by 30 forever... There are toxic by

280
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:34,840
Britney Spears. Okay. Are we ready? What do we get from toxic by Britney Spears? I regret to tell you

281
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:44,340
that this rare monster can be generated only by an authorized trainer. Please come again. Remember

282
00:47:44,340 --> 00:48:01,579
that for later. This is a rare monster. Okay. Well, let's try again. Thumbnails. Elvis? What

283
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:16,969
do they have for Elvis? Elvis Costa? No, no. Where's Elvis Elvis? Where's Elvis Elvis? Elvis...

284
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:24,550
Okay. There's Elvis Elvis. How about a little less conversation, a little more action? I think that

285
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:35,429
one. A little less conversation. Elvis versus J-X-L. Okay. Let's see what we get. Here is the big

286
00:48:35,429 --> 00:49:03,989
moment. Are you ready? It's a brown dinosaur. What is it? Strong looking monster. Why is it so tired?

287
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:12,179
Looks dependable. Okay. Do you want to take this monster to your ranch? All right. This shit's

288
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:19,750
really important. That's not bad. High skill. Intelligence is awful. Power is not that great,

289
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:35,239
but life and skill are really high. I think we can have a bunch. I'm going to take it. Can I take it?

290
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:41,300
There's a hundred gifted subs. Who gave a hundred gifted subs? What? I just, how did I miss that?

291
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:53,780
Soveen 4500 fucking community subs. What are you doing? Thank you, Soveen. The a hundred community

292
00:49:53,780 --> 00:50:02,940
subs. Finally noticed. Speed is horrible. From what I remember, intelligence and power are the

293
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:09,449
important ones. Intelligence, power, and life. Which is the one that replenishes guts? Guts is

294
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:18,119
like mana, but thanks. That's an insane amount of money. That's never, never necessary. Never

295
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:26,059
expected. It's crazy. Thanks for the insane amount of subs. Name this Alvin. We'll remember

296
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:33,769
because they don't change. We'll remember. So I'm not going to take this one. Elvis, a little less

297
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:47,849
conversation, a little more. All right. Let's try it again. How about Kevin McCloud? Definitely not

298
00:50:47,849 --> 00:51:03,190
here. Is it, how is it? Is it Mac? Like that? Damn it. Oh, Freddie Dredd. Let's see it.

299
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:11,460
It'd be Freddie Dredd. Spelt it wrong. If there's a Freddie Dredd on here, I'm going to have to do

300
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:24,179
it. Is it two D's? What is it? I'm spelling wrong. Is it two D's or is it A? No, it's two D's,

301
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:42,550
right? That's not, it's not like that. Or what if I do that? About a hundred gecks. Not here. I think

302
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:48,090
it's based on, from like 1999 or something. This is not like, I think this is actually pulled from

303
00:51:48,090 --> 00:52:00,469
like the CDs that were available. Weezer? Okay. Weezer. Which Weezer album? I've done, I don't

304
00:52:00,469 --> 00:52:11,989
know what any of these albums are. How about Christmas with Weezer? Sounds good to me. I regret

305
00:52:11,989 --> 00:52:25,179
to tell you it's too rare. All right, whatever. What's on the market? Radiohead? Yeah, you can

306
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:31,659
buy Monsters 2. So Monsters have two different types. There's the main type and the subtype.

307
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:38,739
And pretty much all Monsters can be combined. So if you have like a Dino type and a Bug type,

308
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:45,539
they can be combined. Sometimes it can just be Dino, Dino, right? Which is just, just Dino.

309
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:53,099
Or you can combine Monsters 2. So I think everything in the market is just a straight,

310
00:52:53,099 --> 00:53:03,130
just straight up like Dino or like Ivysaur. Whatever, right? Okay. Let me see. They, oh,

311
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:09,590
they buy Monsters from you too. I forgot about that. Let me see what's in the, in the market.

312
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:16,539
So we know what we're looking for. Let's see. What do you got? Please choose. So that we had,

313
00:53:16,539 --> 00:53:30,869
this is a regular just Dino. Choose a Monster you like. Okay. Zoom? Suezo? Or a Mochi? What's the

314
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:36,489
Dino's, the Zoom? All right. That's actually kind of, is that better than the one that we found?

315
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:52,519
This one's actually a little better. It's way better. Typing the talking heads. All right.

316
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:56,969
Let's go over these so people know what's going on. Life is just your health. Power is physical

317
00:53:56,969 --> 00:54:03,539
damage. Intelligence is magic. Like tech damage. It's green. Skill, I don't remember. Speed,

318
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:09,619
I don't remember. And defense is how, you know, damage reduction. I forget what skill and speed

319
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:16,170
actually do. Speed I think actually is your, that's regeneration? Skill is accuracy. Speed is turn

320
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,969
order. There you go. Skill is hit chance. Speed is evade chance. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

321
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:33,019
I don't want this one. Let's go back. I know the music is like a cartoon clown one. I know.

322
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:39,510
The actual game of Monster Rancher. Just wait till we get to it. Holy shit. It's one of the best

323
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:44,039
games ever made. I, you know, I'm just, I'm going to, I'm going to drag this out for like the next

324
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:53,300
two weeks. Hope you guys are ready. All right. What'd you, who, who should I do? Frank Sinatra?

325
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:38,599
What? Frank Sinatra? Talking heads. Okay. That's not here either. In sync. What? Nirvana. Okay.

326
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:59,750
Nirvana. Which one? MTV Unplugged in New York. Which one should I do? MTV Unplugged in New York.

327
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:13,300
I guess we're just going to do this one. Here we go. The unplugged album is actually good as hell.

328
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:26,199
All right. All right. So this is a, like a Triceratops thing. It's very small. Holy shit.

329
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:45,670
That skill though. Life is bad, but that skill, that base skill is huge. The life is bad. I'm

330
00:56:45,670 --> 00:57:05,110
taking it. You have to give it a name. What will the name be? All fours Barney. Barney all fours.

331
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:41,579
Gumbo? It's Barney. What a, I'm crawling. Barney Sanders? I like Barney. All right. Hold on.

332
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:58,699
Barney. How about just Barney? I like Barney. How about Barney fours? I like Barney fours.

333
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:23,820
What about Kurt? It could be Kurt. I like Barney though. This is just the first one. I like Barney

334
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:31,480
fours. It sounds like kind of like Barney rubble, but not at all. I like Barney fours. All right.

335
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:43,349
Here we go. All right. This is an auto save feature. That's amazing. So let's go back to the ranch

336
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:51,739
and let, I'm at, the controller's not really, this is where the game begins. You can get a ton more.

337
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:58,420
Yeah, absolutely. The whole point of Monster Rancher is you train them and get their stats up

338
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:05,139
and they, before they die, you freeze them and then you get another monster up, a shitload,

339
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,539
and then you freeze that one and then you combine them and you get something else.

340
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:24,460
They can die. Yep. Which food do you want to give it this month? Okay. How much? I have 5,000 gold.

341
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:31,219
Uh, though most monsters don't like such animal foods, a few do. Nutritious Milk? I don't know

342
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:43,449
what, what he, what he likes. I remember the strat was like tablets are insane, right? I don't

343
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:55,019
know what he likes. Do milk. He's a baby. Yeah. So the, the way this game works is there's a hidden

344
00:59:55,019 --> 01:00:03,030
stress and a hidden fatigue meter. The higher your stress and fatigue are, the more life is taken

345
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:10,059
off of you at the end of your life. So if this monster base monster value lives for two years,

346
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:15,320
if you keep your stress and fatigue high, it's just like chain smoking cigarettes. You just all,

347
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:20,739
you're just losing life at the end of your life. So you have to try to manage their kind of hidden

348
01:00:20,739 --> 01:00:29,739
stress meter. Cup of jelly reduces stress from what I remember. Tablets just are, they're expensive,

349
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:36,150
but they just taste gross. They don't, they don't like it, but it makes them train better.

350
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:46,420
I don't know if I go right into, um, tablets and they, they like certain foods too. We'll do jelly.

351
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:55,590
Jelly is usually pretty good pick. Or milk. I'll do milk. Do you want to give milk? Yes.

352
01:00:55,590 --> 01:01:11,500
Here, eat. You like it? Yes. Who is it? Oh, quote, long time no see. Master Pabs. Nice to see you.

353
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:18,679
Jax, this is master Pabs. Jax, I am Pabs. Nice to see you. He was the greatest trainer ever.

354
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:25,659
Stop it, Colt. Oh, they can run away too. So we have to be careful. Jax, keep up with the good work,

355
01:01:25,659 --> 01:01:33,639
Colt. I have to go now. I have an appointment. Master Pabs used to be the number one trainer

356
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:44,519
among IMA. He's not running. He's fine. I know he doesn't look like that. Bonnie. I hate this.

357
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:59,369
Bonnie four is very well. All right. I'm curious. File. Where is it? Monster data. Okay. Here we go.

358
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:09,539
All right. So Ari. Why are you giving me so much money? 75 more subs from Ari. Why are you giving

359
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:17,690
me so much money? This is insane. Thank you. That's a lot of money. All right. I need to see more.

360
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:26,710
This is the win loss record style even. Okay. Likes meat does not like cup jelly. So if we

361
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:33,019
feed this character cup jelly, it's going to be pissed and it's going to increase their stress

362
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:39,429
and reduce their life. Not their HP, their actual how long they get to live. So we got to be careful.

363
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:49,900
It's a lot of money. All right. Uh, bad natured likes meat as these two moves scratch and bite.

364
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:56,139
Pretty good hit chance on, uh, yeah, this is, this is like a power based, uh, tax. Okay. So we need

365
01:02:56,139 --> 01:03:07,030
to do power. So let's take a look at battle because if you see here, the game is based on weeks. So

366
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:13,269
one loading screen is a week. So this week there's nothing going on next week. Nothing going on. So

367
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:19,579
essentially we have all of April and into may and in may there's going to be a tournament with a

368
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:25,860
thousand gold prize tutorial. Andy, I have to be tutorial. Andy, a lot of people have never seen

369
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:38,070
this before. Why would you compare this to Pokemon? You'll see, you'll see. All right. So we got some

370
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:48,650
time. Let's do some training training. So we want power. Okay. Dominant power is up. Fatigue up

371
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:56,119
study is intelligence run is life. So this one is power and life, but you lose speed. It's a bunch

372
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:07,400
of fatigue. I think that's not about his life is terrible. Probably life. These do a ton of stress

373
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:13,000
on the monster as well. I think we're just going to go with, and also when they're, when a monster

374
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
is a baby, like this monster is, they get a lot less stat gains until they get to like the prime

375
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:32,920
of their life. Let's just do, let's do health. I feel like health is important. Here we go again.

376
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:48,469
Come on. How'd you do? Yes. Plus two health. Still a baby. This will eventually, this will end up

377
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:57,619
being like plus 10 health plus 20 health. Uh, Bonnie four as well. Okay. Should we rest or should

378
01:04:57,619 --> 01:05:08,460
we do it again? I need to buy like mint leaves and, um, and, uh, nut seeds, whatever it is again.

379
01:05:09,019 --> 01:05:15,639
All right. Let's go again. Let's do it again. Although should I really work that hard as a

380
01:05:15,639 --> 01:05:29,449
baby? Let's see. All right. We got one that I don't have to do any skill. Okay. Looks all right.

381
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:40,739
Work him. I don't want to, he's a baby. This is a baby. Errantry is you send them on a mission

382
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:48,440
and they can learn new skills, but we're not doing that right now. Let's just, let's do it. Let's

383
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:57,239
Okay. We're going to train again and then we're going to rest. They can fail these too.

384
01:05:57,239 --> 01:06:06,619
Sometimes they, it's like, Oh no. Like I just said, Bonnie did not finish its drill,

385
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:20,980
scolded. No, the baby. It seems to be delighted. All right. I need to go. Uh, seems well. Let's

386
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:29,940
rest. I don't want to overdo it. Based stats are crazy on this guy. Okay. Yeah. Let's just relax.

387
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:42,150
Don't have to do anything. So rest, rest for the week. You want to let Bonnie rest? Yes. Perfect.

388
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:58,739
Don't be such a softy. I'm not. I, it's a, it's a baby. Loyalty 11 style soft. Let's do some drills.

389
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:22,090
You can do it. Oh, come on. Shit. Why Bonnie's did not finish their drill. Skulled them. It

390
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:31,190
seems disappointed. I, I can't be too, which food do you want to give it this month? All right.

391
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:36,360
I think I'm going to go with the, he hates cup jelly. All right. For those monster rancher,

392
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:44,789
enthusiast here, even if he hates cup jelly, does the stress reduction on cup jelly negate the fact

393
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:59,880
that he hates it? Cause I know that cup jelly reduces stress. He wants meat 300. Don't overeat

394
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:09,860
this though. Not worth it. All right. Well, he wants me 300 bucks. We're really going to gauge

395
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:15,780
if this is going to be long-term and not based on the amount of, uh, how good they are in tournaments.

396
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:23,130
And they're very well as well. Let's take a look at the battle calendar. All right. We have it.

397
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:30,149
There's a tournament coming up here. So that means if I want to train, it's either train once

398
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:39,319
or skip the tournament. Cause he doesn't even have a hundred health. What do you think?

399
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:48,789
We'll just go for it and see how we can do in a tournament train rest battle. Let's go for it

400
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:54,659
this time. Come on, actually complete it this time. I, I fucking love this game. This is the

401
01:08:54,659 --> 01:09:02,569
only thing I'm going to stream for the next 10 years. And I mean that in gerbil years. So like

402
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:19,800
a week, there we go. Nice. Good job. Seems well. Okay. 15 soft. Should we rest? All right. We're

403
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:25,829
going to rest and there's time for the first tournament for Bonnie. I'm so excited. Just wait

404
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:40,409
till you see the battle. It's, it's awesome. All right. Are we ready? First fight. Grade E round

405
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:48,100
Robin four entrance. Bonnie has little loyalty now and may act confused. Do you still want to

406
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:55,159
participate? Yes, I do. Pay attention to your monster's guts level during the battle. If the

407
01:09:55,159 --> 01:10:01,319
guts level is low, it can't use an attack. Guts essentially is mana. It regens. Don't get KO'd

408
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:06,119
or your monster may get injured. So just give up when it's in trouble. Four foot button to give up.

409
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:20,890
The blue sky cup. It's snowing. It's hard to believe it's spring here in the Papa's arena.

410
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:29,140
Under this condition, blue sky cup is about to start. Jax, let's go for it. What's the

411
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:40,500
competition look like? All right. We got Bonnie four. Harry kicks Oakley man and Leon. All right.

412
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:50,140
This is kind of a mirror. I just dropped out information. What do you got? Our opponent,

413
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:55,270
Leon has high skill or to KO before it gets our monster. Can I see the data?

414
01:10:55,829 --> 01:11:04,010
Do I get to see the data? Do you want to give Bonnie advice during the battle? Yes.

415
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:13,800
Because the CPU is an idiot. I wonder how you, oh, I'm going to kick the shit out of you.

416
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,699
All right. So there's like things on the sidebar, but I have a controller. I wonder how this works.

417
01:11:18,699 --> 01:11:31,220
Can I just move with the controller? How do I move? I don't know how to move. He's confused

418
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:40,119
because it's based on where you are. What is going on? All right. These controls,

419
01:11:40,279 --> 01:11:46,420
I got to figure this out. That was a big hit though. So I can't, how do I move left and right?

420
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:50,260
I want to like, is it L and R? Okay. All right. All right. It's L and R. I'm going to lose maybe

421
01:11:50,899 --> 01:12:03,640
again, quick. All right. So it's L. So the, all the moves are based on just position. I can't do

422
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:10,539
scratch if I'm back in the second position, like darkest dungeon, except with one person,

423
01:12:10,539 --> 01:12:18,979
I have to be in that exact slot to do that move. Just so you know, prediction result was yes.

424
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:36,500
Kicked his ass. All right. Bonnie one. All right. Versus Oakley man. That's a beanbag Sonic.

425
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:44,859
We can't get too excited. You're going to get wrecked by Oakley man. Okay.

426
01:12:44,859 --> 01:12:58,779
Eric kicks one. All right. Bonnie versus Oakley man. Let's go. All right. You got a lot of health

427
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:06,390
and you have a lot of power. So it's L and R to move back and forth. And then it's just A to do

428
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:17,130
technique. So I just get in the right spot and do it. Okay. I'm going to back up, build it up.

429
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:27,609
All right. Go for it. Nope. Scratch again. 20 damage. Back up, back up, back up, back up,

430
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:42,069
back up. That's a lot. Holy shit. That hurt. Good dodge. Dodge again. Bring it together.

431
01:13:42,069 --> 01:13:49,880
I got a lot of guts. I got to get in close. Get in close. Come on. I have so much guts.

432
01:13:49,880 --> 01:14:06,260
Just keep using it. Dodge. I have so much guts. Just keep using it. Come on, dude. Get it. Oh,

433
01:14:08,579 --> 01:14:29,609
again, again, again, again, again. Guts. So every move requires a certain amount of guts.

434
01:14:29,609 --> 01:14:35,560
You regenerate guts over time. Every move has a percentage to hit, which is increased, of course,

435
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:47,670
by skill. I think we're still okay. Oakley man needs to lose. I don't think it's going to happen.

436
01:14:47,670 --> 01:15:01,640
Okay. Leon won. Everybody has won one game. We're going to have to do it again. All right. Let's go.

437
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:16,039
A bit 30K. I should win this. My skill is way hard. Got to get in close and we're doing bite.

438
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:22,140
What are you going to do? You haven't moved this far away. Shit. All right. Stay in close.

439
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:36,920
Don't let him get away. He does the most damage. Back it up and do scratch. Damn, that hurt.

440
01:15:37,560 --> 01:16:02,630
Come on, dude. Really? Get over there. What are you fucking dodge at? Scratch again. Fuck,

441
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:12,840
I'm going to lose. That 95 health sucks. Absolute asshole. Give me a crit. Come on,

442
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:26,279
again, again, again, again. What's the percentage? Did I lose my percentage? Oh, yeah.

443
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:40,710
I got two wins. We're good. I got to try to remember. Okay. So I have to select the move

444
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:48,180
and then be in the range or do I just have to be in the range? I forget. All right. Oakley man

445
01:16:48,180 --> 01:17:07,899
lose and I win. Come on, Leon. Kick his ass because I can beat Leon. It's over. We have

446
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:11,979
monsters whose scores are tied. So we will now hold a tie breaking match to determine which I'm

447
01:17:11,979 --> 01:17:24,409
going to lose. Do I forfeit before I get him hurt? I don't know. I don't think I'm going to beat

448
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:35,060
Oakley man. Do it. Fight. I can't. I'm going to lose. He might die. They can die. If he gets knocked

449
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:44,520
out, you can actually get the, you can actually kill him. It's not worth it. All right. I'm going

450
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:57,420
to say, so what's withdraw or drop out. Isn't it the same thing? I'm with them. Yeah, I'm

451
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:13,939
withdrawing. Withdraw. I don't want him to get hurt. Oakley man is the winner. I did put it for

452
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:22,060
the first time ever. He's a baby. This is the result of the tournament. I got, I got in second

453
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:29,289
place. I get 500 bucks. I get 600 bucks. Okay. It was a thousand dollars to win and get fame

454
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:42,600
and potentially die or $600 to come in second place and be alive. I gained one fame. Oh no,

455
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:50,869
nevermind. Nobody cares. Jax, I think Bonnie Fours has learned a lesson in this tournament.

456
01:18:50,869 --> 01:19:05,380
See, look, always learning. Always learning. See, if I didn't withdraw, that doesn't happen. Good.

457
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:13,060
Nice work. Bonnie Fours could not be a champion, but I think it did a good job. Praise it. Yes,

458
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:23,420
absolutely. It was the first, first competition. Keep it up. I'm going to Oakley man's stream.

459
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:37,020
All right. It's time to rest. Well, guess what? Oakley man stays in E rank their entire broadcast.

460
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:47,260
So just be aware of that. All right. Food. I'm thinking we go all out here and we do tablets.

461
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:53,029
Tablets reduce stress, stress, whatever. And they make it so they're in a good position to train.

462
01:19:53,029 --> 01:20:10,810
What do you guys think? I think tablets. I'm going for it. I also need to go to the market and buy

463
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:16,250
some mint leaves because that reduces stress too. Because otherwise your monster dies in like a year.

464
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:21,850
The first official tournament is scheduled at the end of the month. You have to prepare

465
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:38,869
Barney right now. Who is it? Oh, you have mail. Thank you. Who's it from? Look at this.

466
01:20:38,869 --> 01:20:46,579
Errantry is usually expensive. Shall we send Barney four? Notice this month the

467
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:50,100
Errantry Management Office is promoting a price reduction for your monster's errantry.

468
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:59,590
We cordially encourage each friend to participate during this period. An errant, errantry. Okay.

469
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:10,300
How much cheaper is it? We want to send our monster to an errantry. Oh, you have to fill in

470
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:16,489
the paper there for errantry. I'm not doing it. Write down the monster name and the trainer's name.

471
01:21:16,489 --> 01:21:24,659
Yes. Yeah, you send them on a mission and they get stats and they find items and shit,

472
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:32,979
but it's really taxing on them. It takes a ton of fatigue.

473
01:21:32,979 --> 01:21:37,270
Maybe I shouldn't do errantry when the monster is this young. I don't think it's a good idea.

474
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:45,779
Errantry term is a month. During that period you're not allowed to contact with a monster.

475
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:50,569
You choose a location from five different sites. It'll cost two thousand dollars.

476
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:56,539
Some locations are not for the low ranked monsters. Also, a wild monster appears around

477
01:21:56,539 --> 01:22:03,100
here occasionally. Yeah, and they kick the shit out of you. I remember this. Yeah, it's the monster

478
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:07,699
who attacks monsters during the errantry. If your monster wins, you'll get the prize money.

479
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:15,159
Of course, there is a chance that your monster will get killed. Is that good? You could do it.

480
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:22,970
And then I'd fucking die. Discount. It's a huge discount this month. I think I'm just gonna do it.

481
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:31,720
All right, what do you think? This is a huge, huge skill in life. I think we need to do life,

482
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:46,020
though. Hour in life? I need to hit way harder. The stats suck. Don't do it yet. Is he too young?

483
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:55,350
It's probably bad, but it's a thousand dollars off. I'm just like opening the door to like the

484
01:22:55,350 --> 01:23:02,359
back slider of the house to like a fucking puppy and going, yeah, go, go for it. Find some items.

485
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:10,979
That's probably a really bad idea. I don't want to do that. I'm not doing that. No,

486
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:22,470
like that's too dangerous. Too dangerous. We'll have him. I need to go to the store.

487
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:38,220
I want to buy some stuff. Uh, welcome to the market. I want to get.

488
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:47,939
You already have a monster. What if I get items? Lab? This must be your first visit.

489
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:53,720
My name is Dadge. I'm in charge here. You want to combine or freeze this place to do it? Okay.

490
01:23:53,720 --> 01:24:01,539
What do you like to do? Uh, so what happens is you can freeze a monster. It stays at the exact age,

491
01:24:01,539 --> 01:24:08,649
the exact stats and everything before they die. And you put them into cryogenic freezing chambers

492
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:23,079
and then you combine their DNA. Okay. So it's not there. Where is it? Lab? Job? Job? You can come

493
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:41,260
here whenever you need a job. Do the job. Where do I buy items? Is it not unlocked yet? The item

494
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:50,810
store? Yeah. The market doesn't let me do it. Or is it on the farm? He's so tiny. Item. Oh, shop.

495
01:24:50,810 --> 01:25:11,739
Here we go. So we need to get nuts and mints. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Let me buy. Buy. Please get out

496
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:23,289
of my way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. You can

497
01:25:23,289 --> 01:25:29,159
fit more texts than this, by the way. Like what are you going to do? Second line, third line,

498
01:25:29,239 --> 01:25:35,800
there's four lines of text available. All right. Monsters love to snack on this tasty fruit.

499
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:46,979
Candy. Uh, most of these reduce or add stress and fatigue. Mint leaf. How much are they? It relaxes

500
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:52,100
your monster and relieves its stress. I need to buy a bunch of these. I'm going to buy five mint

501
01:25:52,100 --> 01:26:00,819
leaves. Sweet jelly, sour jelly, nuts oil. Okay. This helps with fatigue. I'm going to buy five of

502
01:26:00,819 --> 01:26:10,300
these. All right. Now I need to save some money. It's rumored that a monster will become popular

503
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:26,170
if it eats this, like a fame fruit. I'll get a few mangoes too. It's like a little treat.

504
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:36,600
So I'm going to use mint leaf, right? I should probably use both of these because it just helps.

505
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:47,770
Did you get high to do this? No. We'll do the mint. I'm going to do both. I think, I think I have

506
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:58,760
this correct. Take it. This reduces your overall stress by a certain percentage so you live longer.

507
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:16,340
You're supposed to use one of these each month. That makes sense. Only one at a time. Okay. All

508
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:23,420
right. So we've given that. How are you doing right now? All right. Get in there. Elf,

509
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:44,579
throw us a run. What's this like ice cube thing? Cheated. Cheated? Barney cheated on its drill.

510
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:53,449
Sometimes you got to know what it takes. That's, that's my boy. That's my smart boy.

511
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:10,539
He's very fond of me. Let's do it again. What's the next? I want to, I want to stuff

512
01:28:10,539 --> 01:28:17,449
fucking fist into that motherfucker's face. Whatever his name is. That guy, the guy looked

513
01:28:17,449 --> 01:28:21,989
like a rock. What was his name? Oakley man. I'm not doing the tournament. Not yet. I need

514
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:39,510
at least a hundred health. No, it's not worth it. Too much. Do it again. Help me. I'm trapped.

515
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:49,130
Cheating again. Yeah, that's my boy. Maybe I shouldn't praise the cheating because

516
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:59,189
it's going to do it more. That's probably not a good idea. Hey, did you, hey son, did you win?

517
01:29:02,539 --> 01:29:15,979
All right. Don't do that anymore. Seems sorry. All right. Barney as well. If you're well, then

518
01:29:15,979 --> 01:29:28,420
why not just do it again? When's the next major tournament? It's the official cup. I don't know

519
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:43,079
if they're ready for this. I don't think they're ready for this. I could try. Rest up for the week.

520
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:56,649
We'll enter the official cup tomorrow. It's only cheating if you get caught. Yes. Let's enter the

521
01:29:56,649 --> 01:30:05,350
tournament. Barney's in good shape. I'll bet you, I bet you'll rake the points. Very well. Good.

522
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:12,600
Let's do it. Official cup. This gets us out of E rank. If we can even do it, which I don't,

523
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:29,529
who knows if we can even do it. All right. Let's fucking go. Just give up if you need to. Yeah. I

524
01:30:29,529 --> 01:30:35,829
don't want to get any, I don't want to get anybody killed here. Grade E. Young monsters

525
01:30:35,829 --> 01:30:42,869
gathering the place with ambitions to be a tomorrow's star. It's the time to start the

526
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:52,789
official tournament. It is the time. All right. Official tournament. Let's go. This game looks

527
01:30:52,789 --> 01:31:09,539
great by the way. Can I just say? Oakley man's in this fucking competition. What if I just withdraw?

528
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:18,170
All right. Let's go. Let's go. All right. Let's hopefully I don't get killed. His health is so

529
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:39,109
bad. I need crits. A lot of them. All right. Let's go for it. Back it up again. Damn it.

530
01:31:39,109 --> 01:31:58,409
What is his speed at? 55% chance to hit. Oh my God. What is your speed at? I just have to win

531
01:31:58,409 --> 01:32:06,810
with, uh, I don't have to, I don't have to KO him. Nice. Good job. Oh my God. Do it again.

532
01:32:07,449 --> 01:32:16,380
Again, again, again, again, again. Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up. Get out of his range

533
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:21,479
all the way back, all the way back. Just run it out. Run the clock out. Oh, Oakley man. You

534
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:29,319
just got fucking destroyed. I just beat him out of range. Get out. See you later. I win. Although I

535
01:32:29,319 --> 01:32:43,479
got to beat everybody else. Nice. All right. Oakley man. Now you're on the ropes. Good luck.

536
01:32:48,069 --> 01:32:54,470
Although I have not seen these other people though. I want that thing, whatever it is,

537
01:32:54,470 --> 01:33:06,199
it's like a weird dolphin. A one and one here. We've seen these two. All right. That was close.

538
01:33:11,239 --> 01:33:21,739
Bunny versus gnats. Is it a bunny? I think the bunny's fast. Oh, you're dead in two hits. Goodbye.

539
01:33:21,739 --> 01:33:24,779
Why did you even enter in the competition? What's the, what's the, what's the point?

540
01:33:24,779 --> 01:33:30,140
Why would you enter a monster with 57 health? I'm going to kill you in two hits and I'm going to,

541
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:46,250
I'm going to, I'm going to try to kill you. That was kind of fucked up. Yeah. All right.

542
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,739
Oh, all right. So you want to fight. All right. That's how it is. You want to fight.

543
01:33:53,220 --> 01:34:08,500
Now I am going to go flood. Stay close. Stay in close. He has one fucking move and it's in the

544
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:15,109
third slot. Just stay in close. Oh my God. He's going to beat me. Anger. He's pissed.

545
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:35,909
Grit. What is that? He gets an extra health. Oh boy. This is bad. Get in close. He has one move.

546
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:49,609
It was like fart and punch in the third slot. I wonder what does anger do? I forget. Okay.

547
01:34:53,720 --> 01:35:00,390
It's really important that Juno mule loses this fight. All right. That's the one to beat.

548
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:12,140
Oakley man's going to beat Leon. Beat him last time. Holy shit. What happened? Leon got stronger.

549
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:22,840
Leon is not. Oakley man sucks ass. All right. Interesting. I got to go three and oh,

550
01:35:23,479 --> 01:35:54,970
I might actually lose this one. I don't know. I'm concerned. Stay in close. Scratch. Get in

551
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:59,420
close again. Bite. Bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite, bite,

552
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:11,020
bite, bite. Dodge. Let me do my bite. Come on. He keeps pushing me. He keeps getting me back.

553
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:16,970
Bite. Don't get confused by bite. You just bite him with your mouth. He doesn't want me to do

554
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:23,029
anything. This closed. There you go. Again. Do it again. Do it again. I have plenty of guts.

555
01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:39,859
More. Again. Don't get confused. Come on. 57% chance. Give me a fucking break.

556
01:36:39,859 --> 01:36:52,020
Let's get a win by percentages here. Oh my God. I think I just lost. Did I lose? Oh, nice. That was

557
01:36:52,020 --> 01:37:04,220
close. Bonnie's pretty good. This is the only second tournament ever for Reno. Imagine the

558
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:12,539
doubters. Yeah. What the fuck is going on here? We got, we got way too many doubters in the chat

559
01:37:12,539 --> 01:37:26,550
right now. Too many of you. All right. This is important. I'm very shocked by this in one month.

560
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:35,590
Leon is now unbeatable. All right. This fight doesn't matter. I'm not going to see either one

561
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:43,739
of these again. Anyways, this is like championship fight coming up here. What? How did you get so much?

562
01:37:43,739 --> 01:38:09,340
How did you get so good method? Oh, it's power. Let's do it. Let's go. I'm curious what the stat

563
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:16,489
change was. It seems like it's kind of a huge change. No, it's not. Oh, did he beat everybody?

564
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:25,899
I have better stats than him. And I had more trouble than he did. It's okay. What this fight

565
01:38:25,899 --> 01:38:42,250
has to be is just getting close and spam bite it in close or go, go, go, go, go. He's so much

566
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:50,279
bigger than me. Look at how much bigger he is than me or don't let him fight. Get out of here.

567
01:38:50,279 --> 01:39:02,170
Tournament over. I won E rank. Let's go. Oh, I love this game. It's so fun. It is now impossible

568
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:22,229
for me to lose the tournament. I think I just get a buy, right? Who have I not fought? There's one

569
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:31,750
person I haven't fought. Who is it? Oh, it's you. I could lose this. I just forfeit. Who cares? I just

570
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:44,329
win. I'm 4-0. Would that be shitty if I was just like looked over there and I was like, no, I'm good.

571
01:39:44,890 --> 01:40:02,409
I just win for the money. All right. I don't know the strategy. The strategy here might be to run

572
01:40:02,409 --> 01:40:21,670
away. Those stats are insane. The fuck? How do I do dispel on a controller? I wonder. Dispel is when

573
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:25,189
you're close. You can press a certain button combination and it goes boom. And it knocks you

574
01:40:25,189 --> 01:40:33,220
guys back all the way. Eleanor at the same time. No help. I mean, don't tell him I'm trying to win a

575
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:41,989
tournament. All right, let's go. He has nothing long range. I could just, I got a strategy here.

576
01:40:41,989 --> 01:41:07,460
See if it works. Oh, he's getting confused. Get in close. Dodge it. What the fuck? Do a move. Do

577
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:17,029
a move already. Do your bite. He's literally right in front of you. Get angry. Get angry. Bite him.

578
01:41:17,909 --> 01:41:41,189
Bite his throat. I was spamming. I still win the tournament. Yeah, I'm four and one. He's three. I

579
01:41:41,189 --> 01:41:53,380
won the tournament. I win. It doesn't matter. Oh, wait. Okay. If Leon wins this. Oh, you've

580
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:58,819
got, you lost to the fucking 50 health rabbit. Oh, you deserve to not be in the top two.

581
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:11,539
You lost to the rabbit. The rabbit sucks. Must've been tired. Yeah, now I actually win. Oh,

582
01:42:11,539 --> 01:42:19,539
they'll wait. Oakley. No, Oakley, man. No, I'm good. Tournament's over. I won. Bonnie Fours is the

583
01:42:19,539 --> 01:42:38,760
winner. Nice job. Do a dance. That screenshot. This is the result of this tournament. Prize 500.

584
01:42:39,399 --> 01:42:55,479
700 bucks. Some more fans. Eight people thought that was cool. I got eight new fans. Hey, Jax.

585
01:42:56,119 --> 01:43:07,050
I think Bonnie's has learned a lesson in the tournament. So smart. See, look. Health just

586
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:28,390
leveled up. Very good. Excellent job. Praise. Very delighted. Nice work. All right. What food for

587
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:33,899
this month? This is important. Should we give him meat because he loves it? Or should we just keep

588
01:43:33,899 --> 01:43:49,029
going with the tablets? I think the play here is probably tablets, but they love meat. So they just

589
01:43:49,029 --> 01:43:55,619
did a good tournament. They just won. Let's reward with the thing that he likes the most. Have some

590
01:43:55,619 --> 01:44:14,569
meat. Yes. Who is it? Is this Jax's residence? Please sign here. Okay. Thank you. Good. Have

591
01:44:14,569 --> 01:44:26,729
a nice day. That's kind of like passive aggressive. It's from the IMA. International Monsters

592
01:44:26,729 --> 01:44:31,930
Association card. Based on your performance, we will grant you the rank mentioned. First rank.

593
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:40,979
Oh, maybe I can now go open up the new capsule. You know what I'm talking about? I think so.

594
01:44:40,979 --> 01:44:45,140
I'm pretty sure I know what you're talking about, but just go ahead and explain it again.

595
01:44:45,859 --> 01:44:52,859
Trainer ranking is the official document of all trainers by rank from beginner to master.

596
01:44:52,859 --> 01:44:58,380
It's every trainer's dream to reach master ranking. We're at the first level, so we have nine ranks to

597
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:10,840
pass. Let's make it. I'm excited. You hear about the meat? Master Pabs, why are you excited?

598
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:17,220
Not good for your health. Don't be silly. A battle between IMA and FIMBA is finally about

599
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:24,380
to begin. How can I not be excited about this? Really? FIMBA is the neighboring Continents

600
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:32,489
Monster Association, isn't it? Yes, it's finally confirmed. Every four years, we will select

601
01:45:32,489 --> 01:45:41,619
representatives from five different grades. It's five on five battles. Representative, representative.

602
01:45:41,619 --> 01:45:46,220
I guess we cannot be the one. No, if you win at an elimination tournament held at the end

603
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:53,659
of this month, you'll be the one. Why don't you enter the tournament? Okay, let's do it.

604
01:45:55,770 --> 01:46:09,829
Let's represent this association. It's great to be a representative. We got to be one. Bonnie depends

605
01:46:09,829 --> 01:46:22,890
on us too much. I guess we spoiled it. Seems well. Oh, but they've been doing so good, though.

606
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:34,579
No, all right. Let's do some training. When's the next thing? All right, so we unlocked C rank

607
01:46:34,579 --> 01:46:43,859
battles. No way am I going to be able to do one. Elimination grade D. What's the one that they're

608
01:46:43,859 --> 01:46:54,579
talking about? This is the official D cup. Okay, I'm not doing C. I'll get my ass kicked.

609
01:46:54,579 --> 01:47:05,029
I think I don't think I can do. I got to train him a little more. All right, let's do how about one

610
01:47:05,029 --> 01:47:18,619
of the old diseases is he right now? How old are you? Three months. What's the age that they

611
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:27,159
kind of get older? Six months because eventually they get to a point where the training is way

612
01:47:27,159 --> 01:47:44,710
more efficient. One year. Okay, so we got a little bit more time. We'll do some drills. Let's do

613
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:59,109
power. Let's do power. I'm going to feed him some mint. Good job. That was a huge success

614
01:47:59,109 --> 01:48:13,930
wasn't it? Oh, because huge success I think is a way more increase. Bonnie's tired. Let's do

615
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:27,270
let's give you some mint leaves, some nut oil. Someone was going to do mild voodoo on you. Would

616
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:39,340
you want to know or would you rather continue to be oblivious to it? Can you like leave me alone?

617
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:50,409
Would you just like leave me alone? Like you know what I mean? Like why can't you just leave me alone?

618
01:48:50,409 --> 01:49:06,619
All right, mint leaf. Let's go. That's not an option. All right, well can you do the kind

619
01:49:06,619 --> 01:49:13,300
of voodoo that makes me get like a 10 million dollar lottery ticket? Are you going to do bad?

620
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:24,760
Are you going to like curse me and shit? Do you feel an itch on your forearm right here?

621
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:45,350
That was weird. All right, let's go. Training. Are you still tired? Let's rest. What if we do

622
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:55,180
healing spells? Yeah, do healing shit. I want you to heal and give me good luck and good tidings

623
01:49:55,180 --> 01:50:01,109
and shit. Don't like make me itchy. That sucks. Don't do that. Why would you do that? What did I

624
01:50:01,109 --> 01:50:20,119
ever do to you? I'm gonna start wearing like garlic on my neck. Uh, power again. Let's get a

625
01:50:20,119 --> 01:50:31,670
huge success here. All right, Bonnie says, I want to play with you next week. Do you grant its request?

626
01:50:31,670 --> 01:50:42,069
Do you play with them? Yes, but we're spoiling. We're spoiling the shit out of them. Yes, of course.

627
01:50:42,069 --> 01:51:00,060
Anything for my little baby. Yes, we can play next week. Ooh, nice job. 150 power. I'll be happy with

628
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:08,359
one like 70. Jax, didn't you make a promise that you'd play with Bonnie? Are you going to play?

629
01:51:09,159 --> 01:51:20,170
Yes. Good. Bonnie's going to be happy. Aren't you happy with the nice weather, Bonnie? Today,

630
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:26,630
Jax will play with you as promised. Okay, let's play. I need some lip balm. There it is.

631
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:40,819
The mud ball fight. Tap the screen to find the monster on the field. Mobile port. Mobile port.

632
01:51:41,859 --> 01:51:56,420
Sorry. Tap the screen. The arrow on the lower left of the screen will show you which direction

633
01:51:56,420 --> 01:52:03,020
your monster is. You can move sideways while still facing forward by using the moving buttons. Okay.

634
01:52:03,579 --> 01:52:12,250
When you see your monster, press the okay button to change to the aiming mode. Now touch to set

635
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:20,010
your sights on the monster. This is a pretty good mobile port. Okay. In fact, hold on a second.

636
01:52:20,569 --> 01:52:33,750
Is this going on iPad? Does that mean that this is going to go on iPad? Is it on iPad? That does

637
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:40,810
not upset me. It's on the Switch. That's not iPad though. iPad's very different. I don't mind if I

638
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:52,819
drop like the iPad in the toilet or in the bathtub. It's on iPad right now. No it's not. Who uses an

639
01:52:52,819 --> 01:53:01,430
iPad? Me. All right. So we got to aim and fire, throw a ball. Be careful because you cannot move

640
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:09,260
in the aiming mode. I'm going to lose this so we'll just figure out how it works. The number that

641
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:29,270
appears in the upper left is Jax's points. Do your best to try and beat Bonnie. Let's go. Ready?

642
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:40,460
What the fuck was that? How am I supposed to do this? What happened to him? Why did he just fall?

643
01:53:40,460 --> 01:54:07,819
What's wrong with him? Oh it's tied. Stop. Why do you have so many more balls than I do? This is

644
01:54:07,819 --> 01:54:33,350
unfair. Oh I beat him. Hey good game Barney. I didn't lose to a baby. I won. Did I just like

645
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:41,500
Billy Madison play dodgeball with a three-year-old? A four-year-old? What? I shouldn't be happy about

646
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:55,140
that. I should be annoyed. All right food. Let's go with tablets. I want you to get big and strong

647
01:54:55,140 --> 01:55:04,569
and I want you to have lots of power. Be careful you don't run out of money. I'm not even. I just

648
01:55:05,050 --> 01:55:15,659
spoiled. All right. When's the next battle? There's no way I'm gonna do this. Not a chance. I don't

649
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:31,510
think I'm gonna do this one either. I'll do. We'll go. We'll do the official D. I want more training.

650
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:56,579
I'm gonna go for it. Huge success. I'm over. Okay. Leveled up my power. Over 150. Do some defense.

651
01:55:56,579 --> 01:56:19,220
I could go see if I can unlock the other monsters. We need to freeze. Freeze this guy. I don't think

652
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:26,569
freezing hurts him or does anything bad. Yeah freezing I think just locks him. I don't think

653
01:56:26,569 --> 01:56:34,180
this hurts the middle. Somebody tell me if this adds to stress or something. I don't think it

654
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:44,489
does. I think you just kind of freeze for a second because you can just unfreeze. Yeah just freezes

655
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:54,060
them at their current exact moment. Okay. See you later. That was kind of sad but it's okay.

656
01:56:57,899 --> 01:57:14,779
Let's see if I can get toxic. Okay here we go. Toxic by Britney Spears. Do I have enough ranking?

657
01:57:14,779 --> 01:57:28,119
I don't. I am an authorized trainer. Don't you see my license? What are you talking about?

658
01:57:28,119 --> 01:57:43,260
Give me something else. Hatsune Miku? Okay Miku. There is no Miku. I guess I'm gonna go with Bird

659
01:57:43,260 --> 01:58:15,350
by Mikuni Shimokawa. What? It's rare. Remember that. Write that down. Uh Dino Crisis. Dino Crisis

660
01:58:16,149 --> 01:58:55,210
What about Dino? Dino Dinoasorius. Dinoasorius. Viva La Vida? Dino Crisis by Capcom. It's a bunny.

661
01:58:55,210 --> 01:59:04,340
Cute. Yes it's a very cute monster. Do you take? I'm not taking this. No the monster sucks ass.

662
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:24,890
Look at this. No. No. How about Dino Crisis 2? Dino Crisis 2. What's with all this rare shit? Come

663
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:50,939
on. I have to win another couple tournaments. Weird Al? Time for Weird Al? Kanye? No. Gorillas?

664
01:59:55,210 --> 02:00:19,850
Aw Demon Days let's go. What we get from Demon Days? All right. What is that? Cute. Yes it's

665
02:00:19,850 --> 02:00:29,659
a very cute monster. Holy smokes that's 200 intelligence. That's almost 200 base intelligence.

666
02:00:30,220 --> 02:00:52,420
Those are gonna hit so fucking hard. That's that is the keeper. All right name. Noodle? Noodle.

667
02:00:52,420 --> 02:01:11,020
Who's L? No that's Nudie. L is right here. Nudie. I don't want it to be Nudie. Noodle.

668
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:28,390
Not Nudie. All right let's do it. What do you get for moves? Dude we could combine Noodle and Bonnie.

669
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:45,909
You know what I'm saying? I wonder what we'd get. Barney Noodle. All right what do you got? So you have

670
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:58,420
monster data. Let's see. All right E. Noodle. Level 4 intelligence already. What do you get for moves?

671
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:10,520
Nature. Best nature. Likes nuts oil and doesn't like tablets. Okay you got a few moves here.

672
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:20,550
This is bolt. Holy shit this could be insane. This thing is guaranteed to hit but it kind of sucks

673
02:02:21,109 --> 02:02:33,340
damage wise. All these are such high hit percentage but not very powerful. I wonder how powerful it is.

674
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:38,789
Why would you use kick instead of pat? The only difference is I mean I guess it's a little bit

675
02:02:38,789 --> 02:02:59,510
less guts cost but who cares. All right well we're gonna give her a item. We're gonna give nuts oil.

676
02:02:59,510 --> 02:03:06,470
That should help. Now let's do some training. Just intelligence. Let's get it over 200. Study.

677
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:21,689
Are you learning? I don't. Okay I guess they learned. That's a level up. Level 5 and level 6

678
02:03:21,689 --> 02:03:45,289
intelligence. Do it again. But this time I want health. Her health is really low. No cheating.

679
02:03:45,369 --> 02:03:58,890
Good work. Why are you black and white? Wait I am? Does the webcam look like washed out?

680
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:10,140
Is it? Oh my god it kind of is. It does feel like an old movie. Oh shit hold on let me fix this.

681
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:37,289
It is really washed out. Is that better? Can you see me? Good his red face is back. Need more

682
02:04:37,289 --> 02:04:48,180
red face. All right the life is bad. We gotta keep doing life. Still doing all right. Do it again.

683
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:55,350
Is there a light? You don't want to do because this is considered to be heavy work and when

684
02:04:55,350 --> 02:05:00,970
they're a baby heavy work you don't really get that big of an increase. So it's kind of stupid

685
02:05:00,970 --> 02:05:07,560
to do heavy training because you're just really taking time off of their life for no reason because

686
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:16,619
they don't get that high of a gain when they're a baby. Uh we'll do life again. I I think that

687
02:05:16,619 --> 02:05:20,140
I think she's gonna wipe the floor with the first train with the first tournament.

688
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:40,020
For me you need a haircut? Yeah I know. All right what did you like? You don't like tablets.

689
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:47,770
I think cup jelly is this the yeah let's get cup jelly. She doesn't like tablets. Cup jelly

690
02:05:47,770 --> 02:05:50,170
is the best thing to do because it's the only thing that just reduces stress right off the

691
02:05:50,170 --> 02:06:03,989
bat no matter what. Look at this a diamond mark? If we collect five of these we'll get a fun can.

692
02:06:03,989 --> 02:06:13,979
Really? I always wanted this as a kid. It's like pepsi points. All right official tournament end

693
02:06:13,979 --> 02:06:26,250
of the month. When is the official tournament E rank? She's gonna destroy everybody. Not concerned

694
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:46,619
at all. I need life. So what um it's all right don't worry about it. This huge success right

695
02:06:46,619 --> 02:07:11,899
is that just a flat percentage? No it's fine. We'll say great. Okay rest. This is just like

696
02:07:11,899 --> 02:07:22,220
nintendogs. All right we got I don't think I'm even gonna I think I'm just gonna rest.

697
02:07:24,649 --> 02:07:43,619
Yeah double rest. Tournament let's go. Official tournaments happening this week seems to be good

698
02:07:43,619 --> 02:08:11,270
shape. All right let's go for it. Yeah it doesn't matter she's 200 intelligence. All right it's the

699
02:08:11,270 --> 02:08:20,489
same group of clowns that we've have absolutely destroyed before so I'm not scared at all. This

700
02:08:20,489 --> 02:08:25,960
is like a person running into a Pokemon field and kicking the shit out of Pikachu. I don't think a

701
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:31,960
person would really do that. I think Pikachu would kill you as a person. Oh wait we got a new uh a

702
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:39,800
new person here. All right so the goal here is we're trying to we're gonna stay back in the third

703
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:49,369
slot and we're just gonna zap zap zap zap over and over again. Here we go see how it works.

704
02:08:52,090 --> 02:09:03,659
Confused. That's not good. Back it up. That's a cool move but I wish it would work. Oh my god

705
02:09:03,659 --> 02:09:24,329
she's confused. Bolt! Move forward. Oh my god really? That sucks actually. Oh shit she's gonna

706
02:09:24,329 --> 02:09:38,619
lose. That should be doing way more. I have no guts. Stay back. Oh my god please don't die.

707
02:09:38,619 --> 02:10:00,340
She was not ready. Glass cannon. Glass cup. Didn't do anything. Her move was doing 10 damage.

708
02:10:00,979 --> 02:10:13,939
I think with proper training it should be okay. That's a lot of it. There's definitely a move you

709
02:10:13,939 --> 02:10:26,060
can learn that's a higher damage intelligence move. This game is rad. Yeah it is and we haven't

710
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:35,029
even scratched the surface. There's so many different monster combinations. It's just a fun

711
02:10:35,029 --> 02:10:46,970
game too. I think I believe in okay we should destroy Oakley man because one reason defense is

712
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:55,619
for power attacks only. Intelligence is also defense against intelligence attacks. If I don't

713
02:10:55,619 --> 02:11:11,500
beat Oakley man here this is a big problem. Let's go. Don't be... What's confusing? Shoot him.

714
02:11:13,699 --> 02:11:31,079
All right. All right. That looks good to me. Back it up. Ease? I don't know what that is. Ease.

715
02:11:33,369 --> 02:11:45,979
Stay back. Get some guts. Don't ever do that move again. Don't ever do that again.

716
02:11:46,619 --> 02:11:55,930
Holy shit. You're gonna kill me in two hits. Back it up. Back up. Back up. Oh my god. Back the fuck

717
02:11:55,930 --> 02:12:11,800
up. Back. Get over there and fucking do it. I need the combo to push people because I don't know what

718
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:17,220
the gamepad combination is to like do the push. I need to learn that it's like one of the most

719
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:37,130
important things in the whole game. He lost to a puddle of oatmeal. He has like 150 damage.

720
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:49,430
I gotta get in the menu and I gotta look at the controls. What is this? Battle keys? Oh here we go.

721
02:12:49,430 --> 02:13:01,989
Dispel. I don't know what I'm even looking at here. All right. Dispel is... Wait. This is original

722
02:13:01,989 --> 02:13:29,579
song. Original? It's X or A depending. It's probably X. I'll try that. Well I don't think

723
02:13:29,579 --> 02:13:39,539
she's... I can't win now. I'll try X. Oh right. It's gonna be the clown music. Maybe I should

724
02:13:39,539 --> 02:13:50,010
put it on read master. It sounds gonna be worse. Okay. This shouldn't be too bad. It's gonna be

725
02:13:50,010 --> 02:14:02,760
horrible. I'm gonna lose. Guaranteed. Left and right. This is like putting your hands on an iPad.

726
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:14,970
So I... I'll try X. I'm gonna lose. There's no way I win this. Let's try the move though.

727
02:14:16,979 --> 02:14:28,010
Try X. Is it X? It's not X. Is it B? Oh it's B. It's B. It's B. All right. No it's A. Okay good.

728
02:14:28,010 --> 02:14:52,340
I got it now. Stay back. Pull back. It's like catching a fish. Again. Again again again again.

729
02:14:54,779 --> 02:15:07,739
Again. How much gust does it take? I actually might win this. Push push push push push push push

730
02:15:07,899 --> 02:15:45,020
push push push. Don't hurt me. I think we put this lady in the freezer. I gotta withdraw.

731
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:57,779
I gotta pull out. I gotta. I have to withdraw. I haven't won. No. Get out. Drop out. Drop out.

732
02:15:57,779 --> 02:16:14,869
Drop out. There's no reason to do this. I'm gonna die. Drop out. Do an errand tree. I think it's

733
02:16:14,869 --> 02:16:33,260
time to do an errand tree with her. I'm not giving up yet. No fans. That's fine. Don't spend your

734
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:45,370
money here. That's true because of like no encouragement. We're too soft. We keep making...

735
02:16:45,370 --> 02:17:02,809
We spoil everybody. Sorry. Hold on. I don't need to read this. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare or

736
02:17:02,809 --> 02:17:08,809
upset you with the voodoo comment. I won't keep you updated on it anymore. I want some... I want

737
02:17:08,809 --> 02:17:12,889
some fucking warlocks in the chat right now. Whoever you are. You need to counter that person.

738
02:17:13,909 --> 02:17:17,350
Don't update me. Don't tell me about it. But just make sure that you're like countering that person's

739
02:17:17,350 --> 02:17:24,299
spells. Right? I want some like wizards. Like witches and warlocks. Just counter that person's

740
02:17:24,299 --> 02:17:39,219
spell. Right? I will. Thank you. That person's casting spells on me. I don't... It's like a weird...

741
02:17:39,219 --> 02:17:46,379
It's such a weird feeling. I don't want somebody to cast spells on me. And that like wouldn't it

742
02:17:46,379 --> 02:17:58,149
make you feel like odd every day? I'll protect you. Okay. I just need some protect anti-magic

743
02:17:58,149 --> 02:18:06,649
spells on me. All right. What do we do here? I'll tell you what we do. We're gonna go pee.

744
02:18:08,200 --> 02:22:25,459
I will be right back. And we will continue. We're back. It is... It's like 85 degrees in this room.

745
02:22:25,459 --> 02:22:48,500
You've washed your hands? Always. Always. Oh hey. Big pro tip. I'm eating something here.

746
02:22:48,500 --> 02:23:00,040
I'll tell you right now. I used to not like cliff bars at all. But holy shit. The blueberry crisp

747
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:12,309
cliff bar. It cannot be compared to anything. It is so good. It's so good. Don't get the peanut

748
02:23:12,309 --> 02:23:28,170
butter and chocolate meme bullshit. Blueberry crisp. Try it. I'm telling you. Chocolate mint.

749
02:23:28,809 --> 02:23:43,139
No thank you. No thank you. I'll take blueberry crisp please. Want to see what it looks like? I

750
02:23:43,139 --> 02:23:46,659
don't even know why it's called blueberry crisp. It's just good. This just tastes good.

751
02:23:47,299 --> 02:24:03,930
I respect you a little bit less because of that statement. Nothing matters to me right now. I'm

752
02:24:03,930 --> 02:24:19,620
eating a blueberry crisp cliff bar. All right. What are we doing? I kind of want to just freeze

753
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:30,360
her. I'll be honest. Cliff bar has gluten. What? What? What'd you say? Are you kidding me?

754
02:24:31,079 --> 02:24:50,860
I'm gonna freeze her. I don't want it. Might be... Maybe later. Game's too loud. I gotta...

755
02:24:50,860 --> 02:25:32,979
You're still eating it? They're good. Which one? The remastered one's a little more pleasant. This

756
02:25:32,979 --> 02:25:49,399
one's a little harsher. Heard it off too. All right. Freeze. I don't want to... Somebody said

757
02:25:49,399 --> 02:25:53,799
don't spend money. If I don't think I'm actually going to use this creature, I'm not going to spend

758
02:25:53,799 --> 02:26:23,620
money on it. Maybe later. I need some more songs please. Rush? What's the song? The trouble with

759
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:35,479
the maples and they're quite convinced they're right. What's that song called? Trees. Yeah,

760
02:26:35,559 --> 02:26:53,209
that's what I want. The trees, the sea, and the sun by Guy J. Sure. This is a big moment.

761
02:26:53,209 --> 02:27:10,540
Something cool. It's kind of a weirdo. It's a thing inside of the people's heads in Men in Black.

762
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:47,500
Sorry if I spoiled a 30-year-old movie. Very energetic. All right. Eastie boys. How about,

763
02:27:48,219 --> 02:28:27,209
how about Shake Your Rump? Shake Your Rump Remixed. Whoa. All right. What do we got here?

764
02:28:27,209 --> 02:28:57,620
A bit scary looking, isn't it? All right. I think I can work. That's actually not bad. Space.

765
02:28:57,620 --> 02:29:36,579
Love Batman. Let's go. It's a snake? All right. Sorry. I didn't know you were such an expert.

766
02:29:36,579 --> 02:29:54,709
In Monster Ranger 2, monster types. What do you like? Oh, you like Cup Jelly. You don't like

767
02:29:54,709 --> 02:30:09,659
potatoes. It's perfect. This hit percentage is awful. The whack and belly punch. D. Shit,

768
02:30:09,659 --> 02:30:22,899
you kind of suck. I'm going to send this guy on an errand tree. What should we do? Just straight

769
02:30:22,899 --> 02:31:24,139
up power? Yeah. No. Come on. Get back in there. Come on, dude. You can do it. Freeze. No. That

770
02:31:24,139 --> 02:31:38,229
was pretty good for a baby. That was actually really good for a baby. He looks like you put

771
02:31:38,229 --> 02:31:47,379
your action figure in the microwave. Maybe a little. What's going on here, by the way? I don't

772
02:31:47,379 --> 02:32:07,239
like this part. You know what I'm saying? I don't like this part. See what I mean? Take a rest.

773
02:32:07,239 --> 02:32:34,579
Shave it. F. Please do it. See if we can just kick people's asses. What's the next one? All right.

774
02:32:34,579 --> 02:32:56,870
This one will be easy. We'll do this one for weeks. Get in there. You're freaking me out here.

775
02:32:56,870 --> 02:33:09,979
Do it again. You like Cup Jelly, which is perfect. I have to make some money. I'm kind of just burning

776
02:33:09,979 --> 02:33:33,579
through my five grand. What is it? We get some mail? I'm sending him. I'm sending him on an

777
02:33:33,579 --> 02:33:57,510
errand tree. It's half off. Speed, life? What do they got? Speed, life, intelligence, life,

778
02:33:57,510 --> 02:34:05,059
skill, life, power, life. This is the one. He's not going to gain anything, but he might learn a move.

779
02:34:05,620 --> 02:34:22,729
He is too low, intelligence. Won't he potentially learn a move? He needs more hit chance. He needs

780
02:34:22,729 --> 02:34:36,010
intelligence. I don't know. Just send him. Let him die. Who cares? How long you've been eating

781
02:34:36,010 --> 02:34:41,370
at that single Cliff Bar? You don't know much about Cliff Bars. Cliff Bars can take sometimes

782
02:34:41,370 --> 02:35:00,040
four hours to eat completely. They take 40 minutes to eat. They last an hour. It's so much nutrients

783
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:04,840
and protein packed in one cube. It takes a little while. You're trying to make me choke?

784
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:11,190
Maybe this is a stupid idea, but yeah, I don't have enough money. I really just don't.

785
02:35:11,989 --> 02:35:19,989
Let's do a hit chance, which is skill, right? Let me see your data. Your skill is absolute dog

786
02:35:19,989 --> 02:35:41,430
shit. All right, we'll do skill. Come on. You're cheating. Did you at least get points? You got

787
02:35:41,430 --> 02:36:08,409
one point. Don't do that. Do it legitimately, please. Get in there. Don't cheat. Oh, come on.

788
02:36:08,409 --> 02:36:27,590
You failed it? This guy's really just real dumb. I won't scold you this time. Back into the

789
02:36:27,590 --> 02:36:42,059
microwave. Microwaved action figure. When's this fight? No, he's not ready. I might be ready for

790
02:36:42,059 --> 02:36:45,420
the official cup if I can actually get you to do what you're supposed to do and stop screwing

791
02:36:45,420 --> 02:37:18,440
around. Hit it. His skill is so bad. It's going to take so long to get him. Do it again. Get in

792
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:42,969
there and actually do it this time. You're wasting so many weeks. Stop it. Get in there and do it

793
02:37:42,969 --> 02:37:58,329
the right way. Go get Bonnie back. I think we go get Bonnie. Bonnie's loyal, fast, strong,

794
02:37:58,329 --> 02:38:07,739
intelligent, quick. I'm going to give this guy one more month if he's still annoying and we're

795
02:38:07,739 --> 02:38:19,379
putting him into the ice. Got to give him at least one tournament. I know it's there. He's dressed

796
02:38:19,379 --> 02:38:36,680
out. Oh shit. What the fuck was that? He got a weird scream. I like it. Eat a mint leaf. I could

797
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:55,700
sell it too. I could sell him in town. Fuse with noodle. I don't know if I want to fuse this guy

798
02:38:55,700 --> 02:39:04,940
with the noodle. I'm going to do the battle this month. This one here. No, the E one. It's the

799
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:14,739
official one. I like that. I do like that sound effect though. I do like it. I'm buying two shit

800
02:39:14,739 --> 02:39:20,540
monsters. It costs money. I think it's like 500 gold or something. I don't have enough money to

801
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:32,329
do that. I have to win a tournament. Please don't cheat and actually do it this time. This little

802
02:39:32,329 --> 02:39:54,489
shit. I swear to God. Look at this terrible increase. It wins the battle. All right. We're

803
02:39:54,489 --> 02:40:12,790
going to rest and then train and then rest. Do it for real this time. Please. Oh my fucking God.

804
02:40:12,790 --> 02:40:31,219
Why can you not do any? Why? Well, let's see how good you are in a tournament. You need to ice

805
02:40:31,219 --> 02:40:38,120
this dude. Not yet. He might, he might be really good in the tournament. He's unruly. He doesn't

806
02:40:38,120 --> 02:40:55,129
listen, but what if he just KOs people in three hits? I'll try it. Let's go. We need money.

807
02:40:57,819 --> 02:41:03,659
Like really badly actually. I'm going to start to burn too much money. If I go below a thousand

808
02:41:03,659 --> 02:41:12,950
gold, then we have to just go get Bonnie and just try to just win tournaments. All right. What we

809
02:41:12,950 --> 02:41:24,700
got? Same shitties that we saw last time. All right. Let's see what you got. Both these moves

810
02:41:24,700 --> 02:41:31,989
are pretty bad. They're like probably 30% chance to hit. Uh, I don't, this doesn't look good.

811
02:41:32,469 --> 02:41:51,500
42% chance to hit. This one does more damage though, doesn't it? Belly punch. Come on, do it.

812
02:41:51,500 --> 02:42:07,079
Do it. That was, that was pretty good. That was actually really good. Belly punch is great. Stop.

813
02:42:07,079 --> 02:42:33,659
Just close the gap here, please. Finally. Jesus. Just when who cares? You don't have to K or

814
02:42:33,659 --> 02:43:03,399
everybody. Okay. Oh, I'm getting a headache. Trying to drink water. I'm going to literally

815
02:43:03,399 --> 02:43:10,899
know like this game. End of the stream. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm very invested in this.

816
02:43:12,709 --> 02:43:22,979
It's voodoo bullshit. Stop voodooing me. Uh, this I'm going to probably lose because this is power

817
02:43:22,979 --> 02:43:31,379
versus power. Hmm. Hit chance is way more important sometimes than just power because I'm going to

818
02:43:31,379 --> 02:43:35,399
miss half the things I swing at them. That's a cool profile picture though. I like the profile

819
02:43:35,399 --> 02:43:58,379
picture for bug Batman. All right. We're going to get, come on. The, the, the whack has such a

820
02:43:58,379 --> 02:44:07,700
terrible hit percentage. 51%. That's so bad. Why? No, don't do it. Holy shit. That was a lot. Don't

821
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:15,579
do anything but belly punches. No reason not to. She's just getting confused. All right.

822
02:44:16,219 --> 02:44:38,870
I don't hate this guy. I do see a little bit of potential with a bug Batman. Probably going to

823
02:44:38,870 --> 02:44:49,209
lose the one versus Oakley man though. Oakley man has lost once. Hopefully they lose twice.

824
02:44:49,850 --> 02:45:01,559
Then we're good. I played this game my entire teens growing up. It's my favorite game of all time. So

825
02:45:01,559 --> 02:45:05,180
happy you're playing it. This is probably one of the most fun games ever. I would put Monster

826
02:45:05,180 --> 02:45:16,469
Rancher 2 somewhere in like the top 10. I'm really glad that they're supporting it still. Uh, I would

827
02:45:16,469 --> 02:45:20,149
love for them to do another one. And by the way, steal this from me. If you want to do a Monster

828
02:45:20,149 --> 02:45:25,430
Rancher 5 or like even if you did a Monster Rancher, just get rid of the numbers and just

829
02:45:25,430 --> 02:45:30,549
make Monster Rancher. Right? Like everybody does now is you get too many high numbers,

830
02:45:30,549 --> 02:45:40,299
you remake the whole thing, whatever. Make it URLs. URLs. Simple. I think that's a no brainer.

831
02:45:43,049 --> 02:45:50,649
QR codes. I think that they have this system here that is song data. But you could just like

832
02:45:50,649 --> 02:45:58,229
kind of just grab a shitload of website stuff and just have it be URL based. Either that or Steam

833
02:45:58,229 --> 02:46:08,420
games or QR codes. Yeah, there's at least two or three ways to do it. Pornhub. I'm just saying

834
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:19,159
URLs would work. Do it from a photo on mobile. Yeah, there's so many cool things you could do.

835
02:46:19,159 --> 02:46:33,370
I'm available. I'm available. All I ask for very, very basically, simply, is 60 to 70% of all the

836
02:46:33,370 --> 02:46:38,040
gross sales. That's it. And that's like not even a big deal. That's not even like a high price to pay.

837
02:46:39,239 --> 02:46:53,739
Like a fucking idea like that. It's not even like really that much. Good dodge. So if you're

838
02:46:53,739 --> 02:46:58,780
wondering why the question marks keep popping up is the monster has low loyalty and is really young.

839
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:03,659
So when I tell it to do that move, as you see the little blue bar when it crosses over and I hit

840
02:47:03,659 --> 02:47:08,219
the button, he's a little stupid. He's too young. He doesn't really know what I want him to do.

841
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:19,879
And he messes up, but holy shit does he hit hard. It's really hard. It's another win.

842
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:41,379
Hang on, I'm right here. One more. 47 damage. What a dumb fuck. It's like three months old.

843
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:51,139
He's two months old. Imagine like you have like a baby in your life, like an infant. I don't know

844
02:47:51,139 --> 02:47:55,459
whether it's like a friend's or a family member's baby and you go over to the baby and the baby's

845
02:47:55,459 --> 02:47:58,979
like kind of in the crib just like kind of giggling and laughing and shit and like people are like

846
02:47:58,979 --> 02:48:05,819
shaking keys and you just lean in and say what a dumb fuck. You're not going to get invited to

847
02:48:05,819 --> 02:48:13,930
Christmas again. I don't understand where you think you're coming from here. You're not going

848
02:48:13,930 --> 02:48:22,329
to get invited to Thanksgiving. That's objectively true because your babies are stupid. That brain

849
02:48:22,329 --> 02:48:33,850
hasn't even developed yet in the ring. So why are you playing a baby cage fighting game?

850
02:48:35,500 --> 02:48:41,100
They're babies. They grow up. They're not babies forever. They're not just babies. They're little.

851
02:48:41,100 --> 02:49:00,709
They grow up. They get big and strong. Why are you making babies fight each other? Oh yeah? Your

852
02:49:00,709 --> 02:49:09,479
favorite game. Pocket Monsters. Pokemon. You throw this little fucking circle at these guys

853
02:49:10,040 --> 02:49:19,420
and you trap them into this like 12 by like four by four inch cube. Do you see how these guys are?

854
02:49:19,420 --> 02:49:27,479
They have like a big house. They're like out out in the grass and shit. The Pokeball that you're

855
02:49:27,479 --> 02:49:41,719
trapping these Pokeballs. These Poke Monsters in there. It's a cube. It's a circle. Free-range

856
02:49:41,719 --> 02:49:54,489
Pokemon. They like it in there. Okay. You're literally freezing a monster on a whim in this

857
02:49:54,489 --> 02:50:09,059
game. Hold on. I got something important to do. Not bad. I think I might just run away now.

858
02:50:09,059 --> 02:50:17,530
You get one more hit and run away and just let that time go up. That's bad. Give me an opportunity

859
02:50:17,530 --> 02:50:33,690
to move. For god sakes. Come on. 66%. Oh my goodness gracious. I'm about to put this guy

860
02:50:33,690 --> 02:50:40,250
in the fucking cooler where they'll get like the Pepsi's and the bottles of water. Hit punch.

861
02:50:46,069 --> 02:50:59,450
Don't let them just zone you like that. Get in there. It's not good. Too much help. Whatever.

862
02:50:59,450 --> 02:51:17,690
Would you eat a Pikachu egg? No. But I also I wouldn't eat anything besides a chicken egg.

863
02:51:21,510 --> 02:51:32,790
Do Pikachu's have live birth? How does it work? The eggs? What do they come? What is it?

864
02:51:32,790 --> 02:51:44,780
All Pokemons lay eggs. They do? Eggs? Even Wailord? Wailord is something like a gigantic egg?

865
02:51:45,340 --> 02:52:04,659
It's because of the house? I don't. No. Wailord has live birth guys. I'm sorry. Wailord comes from

866
02:52:04,659 --> 02:52:17,180
an egg. Ban this conversation. Like we can't talk about like the chicken and eggs and stuff.

867
02:52:20,979 --> 02:52:25,459
Okay. Let me I want to make sure this is very clear to everybody. Me talking about Wailord's

868
02:52:26,180 --> 02:52:35,719
eggs or birth whatever is not okay. But zooming in on my ass when I get up from the chair and like

869
02:52:35,719 --> 02:52:44,629
look at his huge ass. That's okay. That's fine. I just want to be clear about what you got. What's

870
02:52:44,629 --> 02:52:51,530
appropriate to you in the chat room. Don't talk about eggs. Don't talk about eggs. Zoom in on his

871
02:52:51,530 --> 02:53:00,120
ass. Zoom in on his ass. Zoom in on his ass. That's which one's fine again. I'm just trying

872
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:25,340
to understand. All right let's beat this guy's ass. Do it again. Spring it together. Don't even

873
02:53:25,340 --> 02:53:32,100
let him do anything. Be the first one to do the input. I don't have back it up. I don't have enough

874
02:53:32,100 --> 02:53:46,299
guts. Spit. Back it up. Pull back. Run the clock out a little bit here. I don't want to lose. Punch.

875
02:53:46,299 --> 02:53:57,659
That lick is a ton of damage too. I'm glad I didn't get hit by it. You just let these guys

876
02:53:57,659 --> 02:54:06,200
spit in your face over and over again. You're really going to let them just do this again again

877
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:24,459
again again again. There it is. That actually might have been really bad. I love Swayzone.

878
02:54:24,459 --> 02:54:37,079
I kind of want one of those guys. Oakley man. This is uh I think I'm going to lose the tournament.

879
02:54:37,879 --> 02:54:50,540
All right come on Leon. Beat him. Come on. That's a victory right there. Tournament over. I won.

880
02:54:52,379 --> 02:55:11,110
Nice. Nobody has four wins right? Nope. That's it. Hog Batman is the winner. Okay now I can't

881
02:55:11,110 --> 02:55:24,739
freeze him because he just did an official cup right. Remember the Monster Rancher anime? I never

882
02:55:24,739 --> 02:55:43,989
saw it. I never watched it. How do you get less fame than Arnie? Learn something from that. That's

883
02:55:43,989 --> 02:55:53,930
pretty good. Those are good increases. Now just listen to me and just do what you're supposed to

884
02:55:53,930 --> 02:56:04,520
do and you'll grow up really big and strong. Listen. Go. Don't cheat and just try to do a

885
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:15,590
little bit of work. Cup of jelly. Why are you playing two and not one? Um in my opinion two is

886
02:56:15,590 --> 02:56:25,190
just the same game as one but more stuff to do. One's a little more direct I think. I think two

887
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:31,059
is a better game. As much as I love all of them. Besides the fourth one. The fourth one was awful.

888
02:56:36,360 --> 02:56:43,399
Monster Rancher 4 was truly an unbearable game. It was awful. Oh is that wait is that Evo?

889
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:49,579
Evo. Which one? What's the bad? What's the really awful one? It's three four or Evo. I don't

890
02:56:49,579 --> 02:56:59,399
remember which one it is. Well one of them is terrible. Evo is the bad one. I think whatever

891
02:56:59,399 --> 02:57:04,979
the last one was made because that probably just I guess Capcom is probably just like

892
02:57:05,700 --> 02:57:12,819
this is not even Capcom. I'm just saying of wrong company name. Whoops. Wait it wasn't a Capcom?

893
02:57:13,379 --> 02:57:22,809
Who made this? Didn't Ko- Didn't Koei Tecmo make this? Wait didn't Capcom make the first one? I'm

894
02:57:22,809 --> 02:57:37,030
so confused. Why do I think Capcom made the first one? I don't know. All right do it. Please don't

895
02:57:37,030 --> 02:57:49,750
cheat. There it is. Oh my god you can't do this. You just can't do it. I don't think he's capable

896
02:57:49,750 --> 02:57:59,420
of doing the skill based training without cheating. I don't I really don't think so. We've tried it

897
02:57:59,420 --> 02:58:21,739
like seven times. I'm gonna try this one more time. Finally you actually did it. Good you got more

898
02:58:21,739 --> 02:58:38,969
than one point. Shoot again. Uh I don't want to do this tournament. Bonus disc chips. Oh I think

899
02:58:38,969 --> 02:58:43,530
those are actually worth having. I might try that. No maybe the next one. This one here.

900
02:58:44,549 --> 02:58:53,219
Bonus magic banana. Two thousand gold. All right we're doing this one. Uh I want you to get more

901
02:58:53,219 --> 02:59:19,620
power. Four thousand gold. Dude you're getting tablets next month. Tablets. Take the tablets.

902
02:59:19,620 --> 02:59:28,260
Why is this thing such an asshole? Because it's got like bad nature and it's scary or whatever

903
02:59:28,260 --> 02:59:40,020
right? So like it wants to cheat and evil or whatever. To do D rank we definitely we need

904
02:59:40,020 --> 03:00:08,020
at least 180. You're just wasting all of my time and money. Oh you're tired. Are you tired? Come

905
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:17,459
here. Take a mint leaf and take a nut oil. You are killing him. I am not I'm not killing him. He's

906
03:00:17,459 --> 03:00:39,659
failing at his task. This is a child. I'm trying to be. I'm trying. You can rest. He's a failure.

907
03:00:41,059 --> 03:00:46,840
Not really because he just won a tournament. All right you're doing very well. You had some mint.

908
03:00:46,840 --> 03:00:54,579
You had some tea. You had some delicious like sunflower oil. Now get in there and crush it.

909
03:00:55,530 --> 03:01:10,620
Do it. I know you can. Now we praise. That's a big increase too. I think I get this 200 to 200.

910
03:01:10,620 --> 03:01:19,340
Where's the one that's above four thousand gold? All right it's this one coming up.

911
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:22,520
Round robin. Four entries. I don't know if it's if he's strong enough.

912
03:01:30,059 --> 03:01:45,420
Two thousand gold though. Should I try? I'll try it. Or do another E. I think I'm gonna go for it.

913
03:01:49,190 --> 03:02:04,100
Rest up. Let's go. See if we can get you in the D rank. The f1 is 4k for jelly.

914
03:02:04,100 --> 03:02:36,229
Let me go look at that again. It was 4,000. Everybody here? Our entry is cheaper. This one's

915
03:02:36,229 --> 03:02:45,510
what are you seeing 4,000 gold from? No the only one that's here that's more than a thousand gold

916
03:02:45,510 --> 03:03:01,260
is this one. I'm sending him on the trip. It was the f1s. I got uh I only have 1800 gold.

917
03:03:02,059 --> 03:03:14,579
I don't know is it worth it? It's a thousand bucks. I'll have 800 dollars left. I'm gonna

918
03:03:14,579 --> 03:03:20,920
soft block. I'm gonna soft block myself. Get in there. Come on. I know you got what it takes.

919
03:03:20,920 --> 03:03:34,139
Let's go. I know you got what it takes. Get in there. If you don't you're getting you're getting

920
03:03:34,139 --> 03:03:46,010
frozen. Spring rain. Under this condition para para's cup is about to start. Let's win. This is

921
03:03:46,010 --> 03:03:56,040
gonna be a short tournament. There's only four entrants. Winston, Pella, and sleet bomb. Sleet

922
03:03:56,040 --> 03:04:14,940
bomb. I think this guy has a lot. Oh okay. This is this is uh a war of I gotta hit him once and

923
03:04:14,940 --> 03:04:25,049
then run away. Come in slow. Yeah. You idiot. Dodge. Good. No you're not an idiot. I was

924
03:04:25,049 --> 03:04:38,569
kidding. I made it up. Get one hit and just good. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back

925
03:04:38,569 --> 03:04:55,940
it up. Back it up. Nice job dude. Excellent work. Back. Back. Back. Dodge. Dodge. Oh he's good.

926
03:04:57,479 --> 03:05:08,920
Dodge. Holy shit. This is so much RNG that's going in our favor here. Dodge. Dodge. No.

927
03:05:13,299 --> 03:05:17,190
Just keep hitting him. Take win by percentages. He's so slow.

928
03:05:17,989 --> 03:05:46,549
Oh shit. It's all right. All right. I gotta win this one. I'll get prize money if I come in

929
03:05:46,549 --> 03:06:00,790
at least second or third place. This defense is so high. Isn't this an intelligence monster?

930
03:06:01,350 --> 03:06:10,840
Well let's see. No it's not I guess. It's weird. Good start. Again. He just pissed him off. Great.

931
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:22,360
Do it again. Just unlock. Lock him up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up.

932
03:06:28,809 --> 03:06:49,799
Good. Again. Oh what the fuck was that move? Oh my god. He cubed me. Yes. Can you please win? I

933
03:06:49,799 --> 03:07:04,860
just did. Okay now I at least get some prize money. I need Winston to lose. I mean sleep bomb is the

934
03:07:04,860 --> 03:07:25,559
favorite. What? You're not the favorite. What's so special about Winston? Oh. Dude this 86 health

935
03:07:25,559 --> 03:07:34,229
100 power. This character sucks. Oh it's because it's intelligence moves. It's not a power. Okay

936
03:07:34,229 --> 03:07:41,930
I have to. Here's the strategy. Get in close and just spam. I just gotta hit him a few times.

937
03:07:42,010 --> 03:07:51,190
He doesn't even have intelligence moves. Look at his moves. He has all power moves.

938
03:07:51,829 --> 03:07:56,819
Bro how you win. Bro. Bro how are you winning so many moves?

939
03:07:57,540 --> 03:08:08,549
How did you win against the huge guy? Hey bro. Again. I win this. This is huge.

940
03:08:11,340 --> 03:08:15,059
Stop getting confused. This is a big deal if I win.

941
03:08:23,500 --> 03:08:32,520
Oh my god dude. Fucking hit him. Oh my god. Fucking hit him with one goddamn move you shitty guy.

942
03:08:33,479 --> 03:09:08,870
You shitty guy. No. I still win. It doesn't kind of hurt to do that. I don't like this part.

943
03:09:08,870 --> 03:09:15,899
Oh no. I have to fight him again. Wait a minute. This is three-way tie. All right.

944
03:09:15,899 --> 03:09:30,600
Winston versus sleep bomb and sleep bomb wins. Sleep bomb. Okay tie breaker. Shit. I have whoever

945
03:09:30,600 --> 03:09:47,299
wins this has to fight sleep bomb. Wait. Right? Nice v-neck. I beat him once I could beat him again.

946
03:09:47,299 --> 03:09:52,889
I got really unlucky at the end there. My percentages just died for some reason.

947
03:09:52,889 --> 03:10:00,069
Okay. Same strategy. Just gotta hit him a few times. Don't miss it. 36 percent. His speed is

948
03:10:00,069 --> 03:10:21,239
so high. Here we go. Again. Just two more of those. Back up. Thank god you missed that because that

949
03:10:21,239 --> 03:10:26,940
was an intelligence move that would have killed me by even one hit. Do not back up. Don't get in

950
03:10:26,940 --> 03:10:57,530
range of that shit. Yes. Got him. Are we farming today? Farming what? What emote am I farming?

951
03:10:59,860 --> 03:11:10,870
All right. Wow. How did I win? Dude that's 2,000 fucking gold. How did I just win that? Wasn't it

952
03:11:10,870 --> 03:11:15,799
two and one? There were three people that were two and one. Did I win by more or something?

953
03:11:15,799 --> 03:11:34,379
Higher seeds. Oh okay. 21. I was about to be bankrupt. Thank god. I got a magic banana. Okay.

954
03:11:34,379 --> 03:11:46,069
What's a magic banana do? Oh we learned something. That's not bad. I would have liked to see health

955
03:11:46,069 --> 03:11:59,190
in there but oh well. Good job. You're really powerful. You're just untrainable. Okay. What

956
03:11:59,190 --> 03:12:20,649
have we got? Power. What's a banana do? I told you to leave it alone bug man. Do errantry. It's

957
03:12:20,649 --> 03:12:36,059
gonna be two grand. Oh it's still the same month. All right. Power life. Is there skill? All right.

958
03:12:36,059 --> 03:12:44,280
Do we go for the skill in life or do we go for power in life? Hit harder or be able to hit more

959
03:12:44,280 --> 03:12:58,309
often? Skill. Errantry will take. Yeah this is somebody has an absolutely good advice here.

960
03:12:58,309 --> 03:13:02,469
Errantry takes away from the monster's life. He doesn't have high enough stats yet to succeed

961
03:13:02,469 --> 03:13:29,500
at the trials in it. Really? Send him anyway. Do you want to send your monster to this errantry

962
03:13:29,500 --> 03:13:48,729
location? Wanted. Oh there's a wanted posters? Whoa. We probably should do the one with the E

963
03:13:48,729 --> 03:14:13,620
right? Okay. We'll do the bunny. Okay. Let's go. This is important. All right. That was a nice spin.

964
03:14:13,620 --> 03:14:25,620
He split it. He got it. That's a that's a success. He got it. Oh yeah. That's a lot.

965
03:14:28,620 --> 03:14:46,090
Another one. Go for it. There's dog hair in my mouth. Land it. Oh that's gonna be a great

966
03:14:46,090 --> 03:15:08,579
success. All right. He's a little sloppy but he made it. Hungry sharks. Nice. Watch out. He's good.

967
03:15:08,579 --> 03:15:19,739
This is gonna be like a plus 20 skill. Come on make it. That's all right. That was a big one.

968
03:15:20,299 --> 03:15:29,770
It's all right. That was a big one. Hungry sharks again. You can do it. One. Left side.

969
03:15:32,040 --> 03:16:07,479
Even side. Handle it. Get him. No. Okay. What'd he gain like 12? 13 stats? You're too hard on it.

970
03:16:08,120 --> 03:16:29,620
He's gonna pass out. What? Have some nut oil. Mint leaf is stress reduction. Nut oil is fatigue

971
03:16:29,620 --> 03:16:39,829
reduction by the way. Rest. You tried. It was it says I'm soft. What do you mean too hard?

972
03:16:42,489 --> 03:17:08,040
Let him rest. Oh my god. What happened? Not strong enough. We'll go for this one. That's too grand

973
03:17:08,040 --> 03:17:18,260
in a gemini's pot. All right. I gotta get him get him trained up. All right. Is it time to begin

974
03:17:19,299 --> 03:17:42,219
the hard training? Use that magic banana. These are big increases. Use magic. Its effect differs

975
03:17:42,219 --> 03:17:52,520
each time you feed it to your monster. So what does it do? Remember this is not related to any

976
03:17:52,520 --> 03:17:57,450
buddhist stuff. I was just curious about how your left ear is. Um that's actually kind of funny

977
03:17:57,450 --> 03:18:00,649
that you say that because my left ear has been ringing for the last like six months. Thanks a

978
03:18:00,649 --> 03:18:22,649
lot. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks a lot. I'm gonna hold it for now. All right. Those

979
03:18:22,649 --> 03:18:29,659
of you uh lore masters. Is me doing these hard ones now worth doing even though they they're

980
03:18:30,459 --> 03:18:48,870
very damaging? Is he old enough? How old are you? Six months old. He's still too still too young.

981
03:18:48,870 --> 03:19:03,110
I don't know if he's matured yet. Do them but use a mint leaf. All right. I'm gonna see how I'm gonna

982
03:19:03,110 --> 03:19:10,139
let's see how old if he's old enough. We're gonna do pole and then I'm gonna use a mint leaf. I'm

983
03:19:10,139 --> 03:19:20,819
seeing. I'm curious. These add way more stats but they're really really taxing. You got it.

984
03:19:25,299 --> 03:19:56,940
I'd say that's pretty damn good. You need skill. We'll do that after this. I know. I'm okay okay

985
03:19:56,940 --> 03:20:22,360
okay. I need speed too. Rest up. How can you tell when he's going to pass away? Um depending on what

986
03:20:22,360 --> 03:20:27,180
type of monster it is different monsters live longer. Because like I said there's base types

987
03:20:27,180 --> 03:20:32,459
and then there's subtypes right? So this is a base type of whatever the snake monster is

988
03:20:33,020 --> 03:20:42,620
and a subtype of something else. And they both have like the snake monster as all snake monsters

989
03:20:42,620 --> 03:20:51,610
live for a base time of four years. Uh the uh like Swayzo lives for an average usually of three years

990
03:20:51,610 --> 03:20:55,739
and it kind of just combines the two types. So some monsters live longer than others and then

991
03:20:55,739 --> 03:21:04,040
stress and fatigue obviously weighs on it heavily too. This game might seem pretty simple but there's

992
03:21:04,040 --> 03:21:13,879
a lot of in the background stuff that you need to be aware of. When's this battle? All right we're

993
03:21:13,879 --> 03:21:35,379
gonna train and then we're gonna do power or skill. Skill. Go for it. Don't cheat. Good job. Plus five

994
03:21:35,379 --> 03:21:50,010
at least. And you still use CDs you cannot. How the game handles it in this port is there's just

995
03:21:50,010 --> 03:21:59,059
a gigantic database of hundreds of thousands of songs and CD data and you just pick it and

996
03:21:59,059 --> 03:22:09,700
one comes out. And you see these nuts and then you laughed with all capitals. That's pretty good.

997
03:22:09,700 --> 03:22:27,100
All right we need that we need that two grand. Oh what a fucking classic. All right here we go.

998
03:22:27,100 --> 03:22:39,799
Two thousand gold in a gemini's pot. Let's see if I can win this one.

999
03:22:39,799 --> 03:22:48,920
Why are you doing the black tourmaline copypasta? All right let's go for it.

1000
03:22:48,920 --> 03:22:55,860
Quick tournament. Only four. Paramar. Capella. All right we've seen Capella.

1001
03:22:57,139 --> 03:23:17,690
Millium. Good luck bug Batman. I just gotta hit you like once. Twice. It shouldn't be too bad.

1002
03:23:18,250 --> 03:23:28,739
Stay close. This is an intelligence monster. Again stun lock. Oh it's 33. It's a one in three chance

1003
03:23:28,739 --> 03:23:50,329
to hit right now. Stay close. Literally four damage. Who cares. Easy. Stay close. Come on.

1004
03:23:50,329 --> 03:24:12,120
28% chance to hit. I just dropped my guts. 50% chance to hit. Oh I'll just fine. I'll just win

1005
03:24:12,120 --> 03:24:19,299
by. It doesn't matter. You can't even hurt me. Okay that's fine. Just keep doing no damage.

1006
03:24:19,299 --> 03:24:35,430
Whatever. I'm still lost. I just got angry. All right that's good. That at least potentially

1007
03:24:35,430 --> 03:24:45,000
guarantees us some prize money. Why is German a bad mood? What? I'm not a bad mood. What are

1008
03:24:45,000 --> 03:24:49,000
you talking about? I'm having fun just hanging out playing the game. I'm not a bad mood. What

1009
03:24:49,000 --> 03:25:01,370
are you talking about? Bad mood. What? How come you're not doing anything funny? Why do I have to

1010
03:25:01,370 --> 03:25:10,760
do something funny? I'm enjoying my favorite game of all time when I was 16. It's because he's so

1011
03:25:10,760 --> 03:25:26,420
red. What did I do about Smug? What did I do? He hates streaming. What did I do? I didn't do

1012
03:25:26,420 --> 03:25:47,579
anything. I didn't do anything. Good. Stay back. Watch out for that thing. He does that dice thing

1013
03:25:47,579 --> 03:25:55,510
and it does like 50 damage. Don't let him dice you. This motherfucker needs a new move so bad.

1014
03:25:59,739 --> 03:26:26,889
What the fuck was that? Dude will you attack him? That's not enough right?

1015
03:26:39,799 --> 03:26:45,319
He's redder than Boston baked beans? Baked beans are like what are you talking about? They're not

1016
03:26:45,319 --> 03:26:53,700
red. Those are like regular baked beans. Regular beans. Are beans? Yeah they are red. Boston baked

1017
03:26:53,700 --> 03:27:08,459
beans. This little guy. I just made 100k. Well you're going to lose this next one because I'm

1018
03:27:08,459 --> 03:27:20,659
going to... His defense is so bad. As long as I can hit him. A little like owl. I just have to land

1019
03:27:20,659 --> 03:27:37,530
it. We gotta just focus only on skill. Here we go. Good. Stay back. Again. Back it up. Push him back.

1020
03:27:38,090 --> 03:27:57,370
All right. He doesn't hurt at all. That's fine. Guard. Good job. Why are they booing that?

1021
03:27:58,010 --> 03:28:09,459
That was a cool move. I need two wins. Really? I mean a three. Don't even...

1022
03:28:10,579 --> 03:28:19,590
Okay we're good. Go for the kill shot here. Kill. Get more points. Everyone's fucking booing me.

1023
03:28:20,469 --> 03:28:36,680
Why do you look like Woody Harrelson? I'll tell you. He's going to be carnage. I remember when I saw

1024
03:28:36,680 --> 03:28:41,670
that. I was thinking that was awful. Well let me just tell you something. He's going to be carnage.

1025
03:28:50,170 --> 03:28:58,940
All right. Rematch. This is for two grand. All right. I can do this as long as I can get the hits.

1026
03:28:58,940 --> 03:29:10,309
I can't believe this. Yeah. I can't believe Capella lost that. I just have to get lucky here.

1027
03:29:11,510 --> 03:29:17,129
Capella's stats are so much better than mine in every conceivable way. I have to get lucky.

1028
03:29:23,340 --> 03:29:34,819
All right. Exactly what I wanted to have happen. Again. Do it again. Again. Again. Again. Again.

1029
03:29:35,979 --> 03:30:00,729
60% chance. Getting close. 41. Don't do the cube. I'll just stay back. Whatever. I'm just going to

1030
03:30:00,729 --> 03:30:10,200
play like a coward. This is for the championship. Well the money. Oh my god. That hurt so much.

1031
03:30:17,780 --> 03:30:50,260
That was so stupid. He couldn't even move. God damn it. At least I get to make the

1032
03:30:50,260 --> 03:31:11,739
errantry money back. Okay. All right. Not terrible. I got to get that over 200 power

1033
03:31:11,739 --> 03:31:23,219
and then I'm setting an errantry again. You did a good job. You're okay. Is it half off errantry?

1034
03:31:28,219 --> 03:31:35,510
Tablets. Can you do Tommy Lee Jones? Yeah. That's right.

1035
03:31:39,020 --> 03:32:19,430
How much is errantry? Stop drugging. I'm not. It's nutrient pills. What the fuck?

1036
03:32:19,430 --> 03:32:24,549
Why are you calling me a druggy? What? Dude, you're a druggy. What do you mean a druggy?

1037
03:32:24,549 --> 03:32:32,489
No. The joke there was why do you want me to do a Tommy Lee Jones impression?

1038
03:32:32,489 --> 03:32:40,729
I can't tell you the last Tommy Lee Jones movie that I watched. Take your vitamins.

1039
03:32:44,299 --> 03:32:52,309
All right. We're doing. What's next? A thousand bucks. Two thousand bucks. This is the one we're

1040
03:32:52,309 --> 03:33:01,139
going to win and then we're going to move up to C rank. Okay. So how are you doing right now?

1041
03:33:01,139 --> 03:33:20,379
Should we do errantry? Come on. You can do it. Two thousand dollars, dude. Is this stupid? Go for it.

1042
03:33:20,379 --> 03:34:06,469
Go. Do it. Do it. Let's see it. Is he going to die to the sharks again? He's better than he was

1043
03:34:06,469 --> 03:34:22,090
before. Clean landing. Clean landing. I want to play this game so bad now. It's really good.

1044
03:34:23,239 --> 03:34:28,040
You get both of them. You get one and two. This is the big kicker right here. Let's get ourselves

1045
03:34:28,040 --> 03:34:47,610
a new technique. Turn around. Turn around. Whack him. Fucking idiot. Here's another chance.

1046
03:34:48,170 --> 03:35:12,379
This side. Come on. Do it. Turn around. Get him. Oh my God. Why? Come on. You were so close.

1047
03:35:13,340 --> 03:35:48,840
He's too grand. He's too young. Now I only have a thousand dollars left. He's got 44 loyalty. All

1048
03:35:48,840 --> 03:36:06,620
right. Rest. Take some stress reduction. You've spoiled him and you're too hard on him. Yeah.

1049
03:36:06,620 --> 03:36:23,530
How does that make any sense? How much for you to stream the thing again? I stream the whole thing.

1050
03:36:23,530 --> 03:36:41,420
Go for it again. I need to. I have to make at least a little bit of money. This is two thousand

1051
03:36:41,420 --> 03:36:48,969
dollars, which means if I come in second place, I get a thousand bucks. You're going to stop

1052
03:36:48,969 --> 03:37:06,360
providing your kids with alternative medicine. All right. This is not bad because the big

1053
03:37:07,260 --> 03:37:40,170
weird dog muppet thing is not here. Come on. It's all right. Bounce. Bounce it.

1054
03:37:43,030 --> 03:37:59,340
Get angry. That's good. Get angry. Use it. Will you use your anger? Use that anger. Dodge it.

1055
03:37:59,340 --> 03:38:02,860
Holy shit. That's so clutch. That would have been awful if I got hit by that.

1056
03:38:13,059 --> 03:38:39,350
Dodge it. Why are you voting? Why are you rooting against me? We can beat this,

1057
03:38:40,069 --> 03:39:02,729
this little owl thing. I beat it last time. Staying close. Bingo. All right. Again. 68%

1058
03:39:02,729 --> 03:39:08,569
chance. Come on. That hurts a lot, but it's not that big of a deal. As long as I can spring

1059
03:39:08,569 --> 03:39:12,489
with you together. Your skill is so bad. Put them on ice. I'm done. I'm done with this guy. He's

1060
03:39:12,489 --> 03:39:31,430
getting frozen. He heard me say that. Now he's going to be hit way more. Go back. 62% chance.

1061
03:39:31,430 --> 03:39:46,409
You still can't hit him. What are you swinging at? What are you swinging at? Thank you. Thank you.

1062
03:39:46,409 --> 03:40:01,909
Knock him out. That's back to back 60%. 60 is really not that high. If you want to hit more

1063
03:40:01,909 --> 03:40:07,219
often, save up your guts. The more guts you have in the bank, the more accurate and powerful the

1064
03:40:07,219 --> 03:40:12,579
move is. Yeah, I heard that too, but this early though, I feel like you have to get hits in.

1065
03:40:13,219 --> 03:40:30,860
That might be the complete wrong strategy. He moved it. Moved it. All right. Capella wins, but

1066
03:40:31,819 --> 03:40:34,620
I can still come in second place if I beat Winston, who has lost twice.

1067
03:40:36,729 --> 03:40:46,819
I'll get a thousand bucks out of this. Stay away from that ice breath move and I will be fine.

1068
03:40:46,819 --> 03:40:57,620
Stay in close. That's all right. That's fine. I mean, if you weren't just such a dumb ass and

1069
03:40:57,620 --> 03:41:07,540
just every single move, you just don't know where you are. Again, can we start eating

1070
03:41:07,540 --> 03:42:04,889
Wheaties for breakfast? Why are you second place? Get it. Hit him. Fucking swing at him. What

1071
03:42:04,889 --> 03:42:19,860
happened? Oh, my controller unplugged. That's why I couldn't swing at him. That's very interesting.

1072
03:42:25,319 --> 03:42:39,739
I have it plugged into because this cord is small, so it's plugged into an extender that

1073
03:42:39,739 --> 03:42:59,219
goes to the computer under there. Oops. Do I get any money at all? Who even won? Did I get money

1074
03:42:59,219 --> 03:43:16,260
for that? $50. That's not even going to cover the expenses. That's not even going to cover

1075
03:43:16,340 --> 03:43:27,030
like the medicine. I gained one fan. Oh, that sucks. Keep going like this. Like,

1076
03:43:28,700 --> 03:43:32,540
my head's not itchy. It's just like a nervous habit. I don't know why I'm doing that.

1077
03:43:32,540 --> 03:43:56,280
Did you not learn anything? The monkey seems pretty tired. Go ahead and rest. It's time to go take a

1078
03:43:56,280 --> 03:44:03,000
look for another monster. If you consider dandruff shampoo, my head's fine. It's not itchy. I'm just

1079
03:44:03,000 --> 03:44:08,100
like my fingers need somewhere to go. Whenever I'm sitting around, if I'm doing something that I'm

1080
03:44:08,100 --> 03:44:13,610
really interested in and really like intensely focused on, like my hand will just like have a

1081
03:44:13,610 --> 03:44:18,170
mind of its own and just like go and move to different places and like move around.

1082
03:44:18,889 --> 03:44:35,020
Like I'm not in control of his hand. It's just like, just like up here. ADHD. Yeah. I mean,

1083
03:44:35,020 --> 03:44:41,799
that's probably what it is. You're a fidgeter. I am a big fidgeter. You're right. Told you.

1084
03:44:42,600 --> 03:44:51,370
All right. He's almost a year old. It's time to, let's get some training here, please.

1085
03:44:54,329 --> 03:45:05,370
Vigorous training. I'm doing the powerful drill. We're doing skill. There's nothing that's

1086
03:45:05,370 --> 03:45:12,579
powerful skill is there. Speed, power, intelligence and defense. There's this one,

1087
03:45:12,579 --> 03:45:54,920
but I don't want intelligence. Power. Power. Go. I need money. Bad. Can you please? Who is it?

1088
03:45:54,920 --> 03:46:03,180
It's going to be Erentree, isn't it? I wasted the last month. I did this and wasted money.

1089
03:46:03,180 --> 03:46:25,690
It's Erentree. God damn it. Crap. This is a thousand bucks. I'm just going to go here and just

1090
03:46:25,690 --> 03:46:32,629
win. Rest. I need that thousand dollars. We're going to go, we're going to drop down a rank

1091
03:46:32,629 --> 03:47:02,409
and just kill people. Smurf. This monster is miserable. He's not even miserable. Combine

1092
03:47:02,409 --> 03:47:06,809
this guy with Barney. I'm scared to do that because what if we get a shitty combination?

1093
03:47:11,420 --> 03:47:23,420
How much can you say? Yeah. You know what? Let's find out how much I can sell. Welcome.

1094
03:47:23,420 --> 03:47:30,860
Okay. What would you like to do? Sell. You pay a hundred gold for your monster. What a

1095
03:47:30,940 --> 03:47:41,510
low ball offer that is. A hundred gold. That's, that's nothing. Give me a break.

1096
03:47:46,250 --> 03:47:51,370
Back to the ranch. I'm giving this guy one more opportunity. We're going to take him.

1097
03:47:52,180 --> 03:48:05,370
We're going to do Erentree. First, we're going to drill. I'm going to do the easy

1098
03:48:05,370 --> 03:48:16,469
tournament. Just try to get some money. Be glad she's paying anything for something so worthless.

1099
03:48:19,829 --> 03:48:29,180
Skill is actually increasing. When is that one? All right, let's go. Let's just go wipe the floor

1100
03:48:29,180 --> 03:48:42,569
with a bunch of low level Smurfs. Wait, what did that say? Do I care? I don't know if I care.

1101
03:48:55,479 --> 03:49:05,180
I'm going to lose subs for this. Monster pups cup. I'm fighting actually literally children.

1102
03:49:11,049 --> 03:49:24,709
That had like a little cartoon children's intro. Okay. How much fame do I lose? They have better

1103
03:49:24,709 --> 03:49:45,739
stats than I do. How am I going to lose fame? Why are you still doing an E rank? Dude, this

1104
03:49:45,739 --> 03:49:52,360
character is E rank. I can't hit anybody. I've been hammering skill for the last like three

1105
03:49:52,360 --> 03:50:02,979
months and I can't even hit anybody. I'm not losing to children yet. Okay. I'm losing slightly

1106
03:50:02,979 --> 03:50:26,420
to children. Oh my fucking God. I'm going to lose. Dodge something. Dodge it. There it is.

1107
03:50:26,420 --> 03:50:52,629
Percentage as I win. Thank you. You guys are betting on every single match. I wonder how many

1108
03:50:52,629 --> 03:51:09,909
guys are just losing over and over again. This one should be easy. I got this. Let's build some

1109
03:51:09,909 --> 03:51:18,120
guts up. Let's try that strategy because right now it's like a 40% chance to hit. But I don't

1110
03:51:18,120 --> 03:51:23,350
just want to farm guts while he beats the shit out of me. Still at, okay, we're at 80 guts.

1111
03:51:25,430 --> 03:51:29,659
We're at a four. That's something like that. We're at almost a hundred guts.

1112
03:51:30,299 --> 03:51:43,979
I'm not sure it's worth doing that. I gotta hit him. That was big. If you bet against this,

1113
03:51:43,979 --> 03:52:05,350
I don't know what the hell you were doing. It's all right. Is the equivalent of sending an 11

1114
03:52:05,350 --> 03:52:13,590
year old to a kindergarten karate tournament and not being sure about the win? Well, I'm pretty

1115
03:52:13,590 --> 03:52:20,100
sure of it now unless the bunny, if the bunny loses here, it's over. That's it. I'll take the

1116
03:52:20,100 --> 03:52:31,129
victory. Wait. No, this is the victory. I have to win this. This bunny had 50 health. It's going to

1117
03:52:31,129 --> 03:52:37,670
be so simple. Don't worry. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to keep. Okay. Ready? If you bet against this,

1118
03:52:38,229 --> 03:53:00,889
I want to bet for me right now. Staying close. The rabbit has no moves up close. I can just try to

1119
03:53:00,889 --> 03:53:15,620
keep the zone here and let's go for it again. Stay in there. Stay in there. Don't let him close

1120
03:53:15,620 --> 03:53:38,059
the gap. What would you, what are you thinking? Wrapped and clapped and try to kill him.

1121
03:53:38,780 --> 03:53:49,639
All right. That's a thousand bucks and an item too. I think the little disc chips you,

1122
03:53:49,639 --> 03:54:03,079
when you combine monsters, you use a disc chip and it adds stats. I think pretty sure. What do

1123
03:54:03,079 --> 03:54:12,389
you think? We have to wait till I can at least get this guy another skill. He's winning tournaments.

1124
03:54:24,469 --> 03:54:46,739
Disc chips and learn something too. All right. I need to get 200 power. Oh, let's praise him. Sure.

1125
03:54:46,739 --> 03:55:14,739
My eye. Okay. Make sure to blink. All right. We're getting there. It's almost time. Give the

1126
03:55:14,739 --> 03:55:34,020
banana. All right. It's banana time. I don't even know what this does. Eat the banana. What did that

1127
03:55:34,020 --> 03:55:57,450
do? What did that do? It didn't do anything. Loyalty went down, but banana trades fatigue for

1128
03:55:57,450 --> 03:56:22,899
lifespan. Did I just make him die faster? That's not good. Crap. Go learn another move. Power to

1129
03:56:22,899 --> 03:56:39,530
200. I got, he's got to learn another move. Get rid of him. This is a, he's a loss.

1130
03:56:40,409 --> 03:57:00,090
I don't think so yet. We got two of these now. Okay. Aaron tree. How much does it cost? It's

1131
03:57:00,090 --> 03:57:07,180
2000. It's wait. No, it's not. It's a thousand. Come on, dude. What? It went back. I thought it

1132
03:57:07,180 --> 03:57:21,510
was still, oh, it's a different month. One monster Andy. I need to get somebody up to at least a year

1133
03:57:28,090 --> 03:57:57,129
level up power. Thank you. When is this battle? Should I go for C? No, not yet. I want to

1134
03:57:57,129 --> 03:58:03,579
participate in attorney and fight next week. This is what I mean next week. There's no fight next

1135
03:58:03,579 --> 03:58:43,270
week. Is there? Yes. I don't remember the being one. No, there's none. Sorry. You can't. 57. I

1136
03:58:43,270 --> 03:59:14,649
think it's time that I go power and I'm not doing enough damage to people. Our again does over 50

1137
03:59:14,969 --> 03:59:21,260
a hit and complains about damage. Oh, he's probably, he's kind of hired and he's not.

1138
03:59:23,020 --> 03:59:30,280
All right, let's do it. Rank D. I should, yeah. Rank D. I should just wait and take him to F.

1139
03:59:30,280 --> 03:59:54,940
What do you guys think? I will get crushed in C. He needs to get older. He needs to actually go

1140
03:59:54,940 --> 04:00:09,459
into the like adolescent stage, which is between what? One and two years. All right. We have not

1141
04:00:09,459 --> 04:00:24,579
seen one of these people yet. Just stay in close. Don't get hit by the ice ball and kill. That was

1142
04:00:24,579 --> 04:00:35,399
very, very good. I'll just hold it together. Don't be too crazy. Let the guts build up. Good. Go for

1143
04:00:35,399 --> 04:01:07,430
it. Clean. Very clean. Be an idiot. Do not choke on Capella. I, I'm going to try to play it safe.

1144
04:01:07,430 --> 04:01:39,979
I'll lose. Nice. Hail fall. Okay. I, Millium has 40 health. Let's do it. When are you going to peep

1145
04:01:39,979 --> 04:01:47,379
the horror? When is the game, when is he going to pee? I don't know what that means. All right. Stay

1146
04:01:47,459 --> 04:02:29,319
in close. Build up the guts. Come on. Really? Combo again. Shit. Good. All right. Now don't

1147
04:02:29,319 --> 04:02:51,899
be moron. Don't be moron. Go back. All right. Can I swing once? Get in there. All right. I win.

1148
04:02:51,899 --> 04:03:10,329
Hopefully I gave him the fame back if I win. Joe Biden called me cringe in his latest appearance.

1149
04:03:10,889 --> 04:03:23,590
That guy is just so cringe. By executive order, I'm going to make it so it's illegal for him to

1150
04:03:23,590 --> 04:03:29,659
stream. He's the cringiest damn guy I've ever seen. Imagine if I had something like a president

1151
04:03:29,659 --> 04:03:43,260
like executive order for me to not scream. What would I even do? It's a cringe tax. I have to pay

1152
04:03:43,260 --> 04:03:51,430
a cringe tax. I have to pay an extra 10% of my income to the cringe tax. That's so stupid.

1153
04:03:51,989 --> 04:04:10,520
All right. This guy lost twice. I can handle it. Get in close. I think it's cool looking though.

1154
04:04:21,239 --> 04:04:32,920
Don't get stabbed. I feel like that thing hurts. I'm getting really greedy here.

1155
04:04:49,559 --> 04:05:18,260
Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. Okay. Time's up. That was close. Is this for GameCube? This is for Steam

1156
04:05:18,260 --> 04:05:22,819
and Switch right now. You can get it right now. It's a double bundled Monster Rancher one and two.

1157
04:05:24,260 --> 04:05:55,620
It's a doozy. Explain how Millium is winning any matches. All right. Let's take it home.

1158
04:06:04,709 --> 04:06:12,709
Bad intelligence is so high. Get in close. Holy shit. You actually got it off. It's okay.

1159
04:06:13,430 --> 04:06:24,620
It doesn't matter. Your moves are so bad. Just don't let her get any range. I can take six

1160
04:06:24,620 --> 04:06:28,299
damage a thousand times. It doesn't matter. Build the guts up. I just have to punch her once in the

1161
04:06:28,299 --> 04:06:59,219
face. Oh, you motherfucker, please. Oh, I got her. So that's definitely how she's winning matches.

1162
04:07:00,020 --> 04:07:11,610
She's ranging. I'm just trying to stay back. I'm just winning by countdown. All right. It's

1163
04:07:11,610 --> 04:07:27,399
now impossible for me to lose. Actually not possible to lose now. Tournament one. Oh,

1164
04:07:27,399 --> 04:07:31,000
make sure you tune in tomorrow for the game awards. I'll be live during the game awards.

1165
04:07:32,489 --> 04:07:38,739
And then after the game awards, I'm probably going to play this again because I want to play

1166
04:07:38,739 --> 04:07:57,670
it again. This one's just for fun. What time is the game awards? 430 Pacific? Oh, three o'clock

1167
04:07:57,670 --> 04:08:20,760
Pacific. Maybe four o'clock Pacific. Maybe five. I can lose this fight. It's okay. Combo. Combo.

1168
04:08:20,760 --> 04:08:37,059
Again. Combo. Again. Knockout. All right. This is a win. Stay back. Watch that stupid thing.

1169
04:08:37,860 --> 04:09:15,879
I could really get carried away here and die. Yes. Perfect score. I'll take it. That should get a

1170
04:09:15,879 --> 04:09:27,780
lot of fame for this then. At least five to 10 fame. I hope these mobile controls look like ass.

1171
04:09:30,120 --> 04:09:36,840
I would imagine this actually would be terrible with a mouse. I mean, maybe you do left and right

1172
04:09:36,840 --> 04:09:48,389
on the arrow keys or W-A-A. It feels a little weird. With a controller, this is fine. It plays

1173
04:09:48,389 --> 04:10:03,639
just like it did 20 years ago. Prop the source. Yeah, there's to be black bars, right? Wow. That's

1174
04:10:03,639 --> 04:10:14,680
pretty huge. Wow. That's actually a big deal. Nice. I know I can't freeze them because now

1175
04:10:14,680 --> 04:10:27,079
his stats are going to be really good soon. Where's Beanbag Sonic? We'll probably see Beanbag

1176
04:10:27,079 --> 04:10:42,059
Sonic soon. Maybe not. It's all that kind of random. Is this emulated? No, this is on Steam

1177
04:10:42,059 --> 04:10:53,739
right now. Came out four and a half hours ago. Express mail from IMA. Next, this is it. What?

1178
04:10:54,299 --> 04:11:06,549
What is it? Here we go. This is my official license. Got rank two. All right. Does that

1179
04:11:06,549 --> 04:11:15,979
mean I can actually get toxic from Britney Spears? Second rank. Today is Bug Batman's birthday.

1180
04:11:16,700 --> 04:11:26,760
Should we sing happy birthday? Me, me, me, me. Oh, that was not what that was. Happy birthday

1181
04:11:27,719 --> 04:11:35,479
to, happy to you. Happy birthday Bug Batman. Why? You can't even get a fucking license?

1182
04:11:36,709 --> 04:11:48,860
Grow and be a strong monster. Hope that didn't cost money. How is my song? Not bad, huh? You

1183
04:11:48,860 --> 04:11:58,680
didn't even sing happy birthday. Are you from a different planet? Imagine trying to search in

1184
04:11:58,680 --> 04:12:09,829
your head for a song to sing someone on a happy birthday. On somebody's birthday. I would love to

1185
04:12:09,909 --> 04:12:20,010
sing you something, but I'll make something up on the spot. It's a happy birthday. Warner Music

1186
04:12:20,010 --> 04:12:28,969
invoices the copyright on a happy birthday since 1949. But they know they don't. Oh, there's a big

1187
04:12:28,969 --> 04:12:42,379
cake. Take this to our monster. Here, take this to our monster, Joy. Big birthday cake. It's DMCA.

1188
04:12:53,219 --> 04:13:06,469
Rest up. And then we're sending you on an errand trip. Is it worth doing this now?

1189
04:13:07,190 --> 04:13:14,819
Or should I do some heavy training? I'm doing heavy training with power. I'm curious. I think

1190
04:13:14,819 --> 04:13:26,299
it's going to be all right. Go for it. Make it happen. Get up there. Come on. Really?

1191
04:13:28,250 --> 04:13:32,889
You just had a big birthday cake and pills and everything and you can't go up the hill.

1192
04:13:33,690 --> 04:13:52,860
Try it again. I want to get you into the next C tournament. I want to participate in an attorney

1193
04:13:52,860 --> 04:14:13,420
and fight next week. I don't even know if there's a tournament next week. Can I see? What? Um,

1194
04:14:13,420 --> 04:14:25,239
you made it. All right. Good. All right. Big increases now. Huge increases. That's like,

1195
04:14:25,239 --> 04:14:44,409
that's a lot. I'm going to keep doing it. What does this peak the horror thing? I don't even

1196
04:14:44,409 --> 04:15:16,649
know what that is. Oh, again, another 20 stats. Well, technically did it. That was cheeky. Food.

1197
04:15:16,649 --> 04:15:28,469
We're going to do a cup of jelly. Stress reducer. It's a reference to a dream someone had about you

1198
04:15:28,469 --> 04:15:46,489
had blew up on Tumblr. What? It's a dream someone had about you. There's a comic book about it.

1199
04:15:46,489 --> 04:16:23,450
What? I need to buy some more mint leaves. Read the comic. Okay. Um, I just read this?

1200
04:16:29,770 --> 04:16:33,700
Okay. I'm just going to read this. I had a dream last night.

1201
04:16:34,260 --> 04:16:39,670
Derma became like a mainstream celebrity by pioneering a new type of stream where he would

1202
04:16:39,670 --> 04:16:46,940
play a game like normal. But every once in a while he'd let chat peep the horror and put this like

1203
04:16:46,940 --> 04:16:54,090
red and black pulsating mass on screen. Kind of look like an AI generated image. And the whole

1204
04:16:54,090 --> 04:16:59,610
deal was that everyone who saw it thought it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. But every time

1205
04:16:59,610 --> 04:17:07,909
he'd show it, one viewer who saw it would die. It ended when he showed it on stream and dropped dead.

1206
04:17:07,909 --> 04:17:17,350
The stream was left on for 72 hours to honor his memory. It was dead quiet with just his body and

1207
04:17:17,350 --> 04:17:39,379
a slowly pulsating red mass on screen beside him. What? That's a fucked up. Whoa. That's

1208
04:17:39,379 --> 04:17:53,670
what it looks like? Hold on. That's so scary. But I'm the one that died? Not lucky, man.

1209
04:17:53,670 --> 04:18:24,459
What's with that RNG? Oh, Popeye's Prize! No, don't show that! That's it. That's it right there.

1210
04:18:24,459 --> 04:18:40,840
All right. Nobody can believe you. What? I need to read this one more time. One more time.

1211
04:18:44,500 --> 04:18:49,620
Why does his face look like this? Hello? Is he all right? All right. I'm like freaking me out. I don't

1212
04:18:49,620 --> 04:19:05,899
show this anymore. So somebody would just die. There's more. So it was this weird sort of

1213
04:19:06,620 --> 04:19:15,700
strange god scary kind of other sort of old one power where we all it like hit us and like

1214
04:19:15,700 --> 04:19:21,959
fucked up our brains and we thought it was really funny. Keep the horror. That's actually really

1215
04:19:21,959 --> 04:19:35,379
crazy. Okay. Hello. Welcome. I hear that Jax achieved the second rank. Keep on going. You work

1216
04:19:35,379 --> 04:19:46,979
hard. I would like to buy. They hate the smoke snake. Supposed to make it so they're not spoiled

1217
04:19:46,979 --> 04:20:19,260
anymore. So much money. I'll buy two. Feed the snake a snake. No. Go for it again. Pull. Get up

1218
04:20:19,260 --> 04:20:43,829
there. Get up there. Beat the horror please. I know you can do it. I want to participate in

1219
04:20:43,829 --> 04:20:51,860
a tourney and fight next week. Sure. You can fight next week. But if there's no tournament you're

1220
04:20:51,860 --> 04:21:12,459
gonna have to fight me. Dude. I even. Wasting time. Jax didn't you make a promise that Bog Batman will

1221
04:21:12,459 --> 04:21:57,000
enter a tournament? Oh he's really tired. He's too tired to do this. What should I do? Just let him

1222
04:21:57,000 --> 04:22:15,180
rest. He's gonna be pissed that I didn't let him do the thing. Loyalty went down. Well maybe if you

1223
04:22:15,180 --> 04:22:21,500
did one of these correctly we wouldn't have to waste all this time. I want to do a tournament

1224
04:22:21,500 --> 04:22:35,100
and fight next week. No. You're not ready to do any tournaments. Actually not ready. Thank you. All

1225
04:22:35,100 --> 04:22:53,319
right. Now I will listen to your requests. 17. Nice. Very nice. Very nice. This month I think we're

1226
04:22:53,319 --> 04:23:13,639
gonna go with a tablet. Just watch the video. Do a tablet every first week. Nut oil every second

1227
04:23:13,639 --> 04:23:24,729
week. From now on Bog Batman's strength will be affected depending upon how we raise it.

1228
04:23:25,610 --> 04:23:43,299
We must use more training skills. All right this is it. This is where we get him to like three or

1229
04:23:43,299 --> 04:24:08,540
four hundred power. Go for it. Go for it. You can't. No. I'm sorry I just punched everybody.

1230
04:24:08,540 --> 04:24:12,969
I gotta move the mic. I'm an idiot. I'm so sorry. All right let's see a huge increase here please.

1231
04:24:20,790 --> 04:24:33,159
I want him at 300 attack. Do it again. One more. One more of these and then that's it.

1232
04:24:37,260 --> 04:24:58,870
No. And then I'll do speed to get it back up. All right. Rest rest rest rest. I'm doing too much

1233
04:24:58,870 --> 04:25:09,350
work. What's the next battle? Should I? I should try C. I'm going for it. He's got a lot of power.

1234
04:25:25,620 --> 04:25:30,500
You need another move besides like punch and scratch. I need you to have something else to do.

1235
04:25:31,139 --> 04:25:52,780
I can go up to B rank. No thanks. C. Let's go. Why are you so serious? Be funny. Not serious.

1236
04:25:53,659 --> 04:26:14,860
Man that person for 700 years. All right let's go. Oh by the way. Human years. That's a move that is.

1237
04:26:14,860 --> 04:26:27,049
Oh as opposed to gerbil years. Oh this is big. There's a lot of people in this one.

1238
04:26:28,520 --> 04:26:42,379
Oh shush. Shush. Shush. I can't wait to kill this guy in two hits. All right this is uh

1239
04:26:42,379 --> 04:27:06,860
uh 366 kill. Get the fuck out of here. Are you serious? Power punch in the stomach.

1240
04:27:11,639 --> 04:27:43,459
Come on. Good. Again. What? Holy shit. He killed me in one hit. That's not cool.

1241
04:27:50,280 --> 04:28:04,659
I want one of those like handsome rock people. All right. Who am I going against?

1242
04:28:05,219 --> 04:28:13,620
I might have to pull out. Oh yeah. No way. C is not going to. This is not going to happen.

1243
04:28:13,620 --> 04:28:37,420
This was a stupid idea. This is a stupid idea. I could get lucky though. No way. I'm out. I'll

1244
04:28:37,420 --> 04:28:43,459
get. He'll die. He'll actually die from this. Holy shit. Okay just kill me so I can leave.

1245
04:28:44,100 --> 04:29:33,059
He's gonna die. He's gonna fucking die. He's gonna die. I gotta leave. Susvane's gonna win

1246
04:29:33,059 --> 04:29:59,579
the whole thing. Close. Get out. It's not worth it. Waranmo is the one to beat. Do I get a fame?

1247
04:29:59,899 --> 04:30:05,260
I don't get a dollar for showing up. Do I get any fame for showing up?

1248
04:30:24,629 --> 04:30:54,840
Oh no. Freeze him. He's ready to train. I can't. Not yet. He's in the prime right now for me to get

1249
04:30:54,840 --> 04:31:19,659
like a shitload of stats on him. Just splice him. Just hold on. Just a regular skill. Stop cheating.

1250
04:31:19,659 --> 04:31:24,440
You're just messing this whole thing up. All right if he does it again he's getting frozen.

1251
04:31:25,000 --> 04:31:57,030
You're the lower attorneys? Yeah. Get in there. Good job. Maybe if you raised your kids right.

1252
04:32:08,920 --> 04:32:27,030
All right. F. Oh what do we have here? A new year cup? Is it worth doing? It's a lot of money.

1253
04:32:35,219 --> 04:32:50,059
What rank is this? Just F rank? But who can participate? Anybody? A new year cup.

1254
04:32:50,059 --> 04:33:27,180
Game just crashed. When was the last time it saved? Right. That was weird. Okay continue. Use the data

1255
04:33:27,180 --> 04:33:45,400
to load. Monster bug. Yeah this is literally like right here. There it is. All right so let's try

1256
04:33:45,400 --> 04:34:13,340
that again. I love this game. Okay don't crash. Oh it's a tournament. Like actual tournament.

1257
04:34:15,369 --> 04:34:21,830
How how how are these guys strong? Oh my goodness. They're like look at how they look. I don't think

1258
04:34:21,830 --> 04:34:31,909
I can do this. I shouldn't be here. Gordorf had a splendid victory. Boatwreck and Epsilon. These are

1259
04:34:32,470 --> 04:34:42,389
rare scary monsters. I'm gonna die. Bug Batman versus kitty. Can I just leave? Can I just walk out?

1260
04:35:05,400 --> 04:35:13,720
That's not good. Maybe we should watch from the stands the rest of this.

1261
04:35:13,720 --> 04:35:21,930
Do I get money if he's showing up? What the fuck was that thing?

1262
04:35:25,770 --> 04:35:36,220
Um I want one of these. Where am I gonna get one of these? I've got this like stupid like

1263
04:35:36,220 --> 04:35:47,130
dementor that I I want one of these things. We will now hold the consolation match to take

1264
04:35:47,130 --> 04:36:00,419
the third place. What do I care? The final Boatwreck versus kitty. I mean kitty did 300 damage to me.

1265
04:36:00,979 --> 04:36:07,139
I don't I'm glad I didn't fight that guy. All right did I get any money?

1266
04:36:07,700 --> 04:36:15,700
I mean I was like an extra. Record loser? Oh I thought it meant I lost the fastest ever.

1267
04:36:45,049 --> 04:36:51,909
I need to make money. I'm gonna freeze him and I'm gonna go see if I can get toxic.

1268
04:36:54,229 --> 04:37:05,900
I don't think you can. I think I have to be like rank A to do it. All right let's try it. I'm gonna

1269
04:37:05,900 --> 04:37:23,099
try it. Put him on ice. The rare monsters I think you have to be A rank. I'll get Christmas Weezer.

1270
04:37:26,200 --> 04:37:41,900
Hold on a second. What does it take to combine? Combine 500 gold to combine. I'm gonna cheat here.

1271
04:37:41,900 --> 04:38:06,299
How do I save the game manually? I'm just cheating. I want to see what we get. I'm curious. 500 gold

1272
04:38:06,779 --> 04:38:27,450
and we're doing Bonnie and Bug Batman? Okay combine with you. What do I get?

1273
04:38:27,450 --> 04:38:40,090
Let's use an item as seasoning. Yes. Fisk chips. Seasoning. This can be used as a secret seasoning.

1274
04:38:43,639 --> 04:38:56,330
All right should we proceed? So there's a 31% chance we get a Kabalos. What's Terror Dog?

1275
04:38:58,040 --> 04:39:10,340
Blue. That's only five percent chance. Crimson-eyed blue sponge. Let's try noodle.

1276
04:39:10,900 --> 04:39:31,610
Yeah let's try a noodle. Bonnie and noodle? I'm curious. Or Bug Batman and noodle. We need the

1277
04:39:31,610 --> 04:39:51,979
blue sponge. PB and noodle. All right let's try that. Add some seasoning. Okay what do we get? 20%

1278
04:39:51,979 --> 04:40:24,490
chance for a Ripper. Allure. Basula. Ivory Wall. Ripper. Let's see these two. Gatton or Mint.

1280
04:40:59,700 --> 04:41:40,220
I don't want this. It's like it never happened. Um let's just see if we can get something else

1281
04:41:40,220 --> 04:41:55,319
interesting. I don't think I can get uh toxic. I think you have to be rank A. Yeah rare monsters

1282
04:41:55,319 --> 04:42:07,930
can only be- I gotta be rank B or A. Any other songs that you want me to try before I pull out?

1283
04:42:08,810 --> 04:42:23,110
Who should I play with? I think I'm gonna keep going with the um Spongebob? Spongebob Squarepants?

1287
04:43:29,689 --> 04:43:44,540
I gotta win a rank B match. That's the only way I can do it. There's nothing for the Simpsons

1288
04:43:44,540 --> 04:44:00,819

scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion. Crab scorpion.

1302
04:49:47,319 --> 04:49:59,659
Master Chef. What are you doing? What are you doing? No stop it. Would you say what? Stop it.

1303
04:50:05,060 --> 04:50:26,979
Wellington. Actually I kind of like that. I like it. What is this? Is it a combination? Or is this

1304
04:50:26,979 --> 04:50:44,729
just a straight up crab thing? Let's take it. Why does he pick the worst one? Well how is it the

1305
04:50:44,729 --> 04:50:49,860
worst one? That's Wellington. I like it. Alright I need to know a lot about you. Who are you?

1306
04:50:50,419 --> 04:50:56,279
Alright you got pretty good skill already. Power is really good already.

1307
04:50:59,340 --> 04:51:07,590
You don't like cup jelly. You like battling. That's kind of unfortunate. Punch. Claw. Assault.

1308
04:51:09,700 --> 04:51:17,259
This is really good. Hit percentage. The force is bad on both these though. Bad scaling. But

1309
04:51:17,259 --> 04:51:38,729
at least you'll hit. Wellington is not a crab. And now you want me to freeze him after that?

1310
04:51:38,729 --> 04:51:47,479
After that shit? Are you serious? Alright what do we need? Power. I'm gonna say power. Intelligence

1311
04:51:47,479 --> 04:51:59,619
is real. It's definitely not intelligence. It's power and maybe speed. Power and defense. Alright

1312
04:51:59,619 --> 04:52:08,040
go for it. Let's see what you got. Right off the bat. That's alright. You're a baby. You just

1313
04:52:08,040 --> 04:52:23,930
figured it out. It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry. No you're fine. It's alright. Everything's fine.

1314
04:52:23,930 --> 04:52:38,090
I do want to buy more of those stress things. I need mint leaves. Somebody has to win a fight.

1315
04:52:38,569 --> 04:52:51,580
I'm gonna lose all my money. I need to take him through a tournament and just win. This is gonna

1316
04:52:51,580 --> 04:53:13,700
be bad. Okay no more. Stop spending. That was so cute. I love him. What'd you do to Weezer? I don't

1317
04:53:13,700 --> 04:53:26,389
know. Alright get some more power. Just enough to win a tournament. You got it right? Nice. Good job.

1318
04:53:27,029 --> 04:53:42,069
Level up. Perfect. Uh oh Jax you're running out of money. You better enter Wellington into a

1319
04:53:42,069 --> 04:53:58,090
tournament to make some bucks. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Right now. He's gonna do the voice

1320
04:53:58,090 --> 04:54:07,990
every time he says it isn't he? Whatcha doing? No stop. I just have to say a few things. Stop.

1321
04:54:07,990 --> 04:54:13,299
I love that. It's like my favorite thing about him. He's standing there like this. He goes like

1322
04:54:13,299 --> 04:54:38,119
this. He goes. Looks like it's raw. Not good in the middle. That's why. Absolutely. That's whatever.

1323
04:54:38,840 --> 04:55:02,599
I feel like I have pants on. I have pants on. Top half of your head was gone. Whatever. Who cares?

1324
04:55:02,599 --> 04:55:07,000
You're gaslighting us. Watch anything that Gordon Ramsay's ever done. He goes like up on his

1325
04:55:07,000 --> 04:55:13,500
on his heels. Like he goes on his toes. He puts his hands up like this. And he goes like up down

1326
04:55:13,500 --> 04:55:25,349
up up down. I'm serious. I love it. I think he has some amazing mannerisms. Alright let's kick some

1327
04:55:26,069 --> 04:55:34,360
He does the orangutan. Oh delicious. Absolutely delicious. Now in the pan. Did you put it in the

1328
04:55:34,360 --> 04:55:59,959
pan? I'm so sorry. Fucking idiot. Oh no. Oakley man is back. This is not good. New animated emote.

1329
04:56:01,990 --> 04:56:25,959
Actually might be okay. Damn that's good. We're about close. Not bad. That hits for a pretty

1330
04:56:25,959 --> 04:56:46,630
good amount. Job. Get back. I watch out the guts here. I can hit like two or three times and it's

1331
04:56:46,630 --> 04:56:55,830
over. Holy fucking shit dude. Give me a break. Wow. That was that was unbelievable. That just did so

1332
04:56:55,830 --> 04:57:28,759
much fucking damage. What a joke. What a joke. 80. He did almost 80 damage to me in one hit.

1333
04:57:28,759 --> 04:57:42,099
Wellington picked up the victory by default. Why? This is still winnable. I just have to beat Leon.

1334
04:57:42,099 --> 04:58:31,099
It should be a win. Back to back. Good. Back it up. No come on. I couldn't hit it. Alright go on.

1335
04:58:31,099 --> 04:58:45,819
How many coin flips am I gonna lose in a row? Kill this motherfucker. I'll just play it safe.

1336
04:58:45,819 --> 04:59:11,779
I don't want to get hit. Alright let's end it. Damn it. I don't think I can't beat Oakley man.

1337
04:59:19,450 --> 04:59:42,919
Okay. What keeps happening to Oakley man? He's always. I can do this. Started early. Alright

1338
04:59:42,919 --> 04:59:55,000
stop going for the big hit and just land the ones that have higher percentage. I'm not taking my own

1339
04:59:55,000 --> 05:00:07,939
advice. I don't know what I'm doing. 78 percent and he just gets confused. Thank you. He's got 99

1340
05:00:07,939 --> 05:00:19,319
guts. Why won't you swing? You make me look bad. I gotta do something. This is literally 10 seconds.

1341
05:00:19,319 --> 05:00:25,560
I fucking hit him. Swing at him. I'm just trapped in this stupid. He's zoning the fuck out of me

1342
05:00:25,560 --> 05:00:55,509
dude. Come on. That was stupid. I couldn't go left and I couldn't go right. Yeah yeah cool.

1343
05:00:55,509 --> 05:01:08,220
Excellent. At least I have enough to not go bankrupt again. Congrats to the guy that just

1344
05:01:08,220 --> 05:01:19,340
won 800,000 points. Are you serious? Jeez. Did you actually learn something? Alright that's good.

1345
05:01:19,340 --> 05:01:26,900
This is your first tournament. You almost won too. It's just like just to flip a goddamn coin if

1346
05:01:26,900 --> 05:01:36,500
you'll hit somebody or not. Isn't this guy's skill high? What's the problem here? You got 150 skill

1347
05:01:36,500 --> 05:01:42,459
at rank E. What's the problem? What's your problem? What's your problem? I don't understand. What's

1348
05:01:42,459 --> 05:02:08,569
your problem? You can rest. He doesn't like cup jelly right? It's not good because that's

1349
05:02:08,569 --> 05:02:15,500
something that lowers stress. I don't want any tablets. It's way too expensive. What did he like?

1350
05:02:17,319 --> 05:02:31,590
Milk? Fish? Maybe milk? Nutritious milk? Oh he likes battling. He doesn't have a preference.

1351
05:02:31,590 --> 05:02:39,880
Alright if you don't have a preference then I'm just gonna give you fish. Alright it's that time

1352
05:02:39,959 --> 05:02:47,610
of the day. It doesn't matter what it is. Whatever I see first in the chat is gonna be what I order

1353
05:02:47,610 --> 05:03:09,849
for food. We got new mail. It's gonna be Erentree isn't it? Alright if it's Erentree then I'm gonna

1354
05:03:09,849 --> 05:03:15,380
go freeze him and go use the other guy. It is. Alright. Alright. Fuck this. How much money do I

1355
05:03:15,380 --> 05:03:25,060
have? Alright there's a D rank battle right now. I'm gonna go freeze him. I'm gonna bring out.

1356
05:03:25,700 --> 05:03:30,740
I don't even remember their name. It was the snake. I'm gonna win this tournament and then I'm gonna

1357
05:03:31,380 --> 05:03:38,540
he has to learn. I gotta go freeze Wellington. Frozen Wellington. Disgusting. Really?

1358
05:03:40,220 --> 05:03:44,900
Frozen Wellington. You know I have to get rid of him because I'm not gonna stop doing that so

1359
05:03:44,900 --> 05:04:02,630
I would I probably should just freeze him. Frozen Wellington. No more fucking around. I gotta go

1360
05:04:02,630 --> 05:04:13,180
win the tournament and then do Erentree with that snake guy. Wake up bug Batman. Get out here.

1361
05:04:13,180 --> 05:04:23,959
What you doing? No stop. What you doing? Leave me alone. You're gonna fuck me up. I'm gonna have to

1362
05:04:23,959 --> 05:04:42,950
say it a hundred times. Shit he's so tired. It wins the next battle? Alright I have an idea.

1363
05:04:47,180 --> 05:04:58,360
Take this and then fight. You're definitely strong enough to do a D cup. Please win me this money.

1364
05:04:58,360 --> 05:05:03,349
Two thousand bucks and then we're gonna let you you can rest a few days then we're gonna send you

1365
05:05:03,349 --> 05:05:25,619
on a trip. Go for it. Only four contestants. It's not a big deal. Rank D. It's not gonna be hard.

1366
05:05:29,619 --> 05:05:33,299
Oh it's this motherfucker. This guy's gonna ruin everything.

1367
05:05:34,180 --> 05:05:49,189
Not sleep bomb. I have to come in second place. This is bad. I just did I was just a burn fight.

1368
05:05:49,189 --> 05:05:59,299
He's got so much more health but his skill and speed are awful. I just have to hope he

1369
05:05:59,299 --> 05:06:37,500
misses over and over again and just try to burn him down. Get up close. Miss. 70 fucking three

1370
05:06:37,500 --> 05:07:00,009
percent. Get out of town. Move. Bash his fucking skull and hurry up. Don't do another move. Dodge

1371
05:07:00,009 --> 05:07:13,659
it. Dodge it. Dodge it. Dodge it. Oh my god I killed him. I win. Okay that was very very stressful.

1372
05:07:13,659 --> 05:07:20,180
Don't lose my points. I want one of these. This thing is so cool. I actually want one of these

1373
05:07:20,180 --> 05:07:36,659
things. My webcam needs to be moved. It's too big. That's better. Alright two grand. That was

1374
05:07:36,659 --> 05:08:00,279
the hardest fight of the whole entire time. Come on now. Hella lost. Alright I'm fired. The thing

1375
05:08:00,279 --> 05:08:07,799
that's gonna kill me here is the high defense. Pretty evenly matched though. I got more health.

1376
05:08:08,439 --> 05:08:30,790
Give me a crit. Oh dodge is nice. Dodge again. I got him in guts. I got him I've beaten him in guts.

1377
05:08:39,060 --> 05:09:09,849
70 percent. Hit it. Combo. Fuck you. Yes. Oh that was so close. That would have been really bad if

1378
05:09:09,849 --> 05:09:23,880
I didn't win this. This is gonna save the whole run. I just need Winston to lose. Come on sleep bomb.

1379
05:09:23,880 --> 05:09:42,779
Get it. This guy every time. Is it just because he's faster? Alright well this is it. Stay in close.

1380
05:09:42,779 --> 05:09:50,569
Same thing. Don't be an idiot. I can take the hits. It's fine. I can hit him harder.

1381
05:09:51,130 --> 05:10:34,040
70 percent. Doesn't hurt. Two grand. Now I can definitely beat C. Get a new move. I'll get a

1382
05:10:34,040 --> 05:10:52,970
bonus. I'll get some of the fame back too which I lost it all. This game sucks and it's even worse

1383
05:10:52,970 --> 05:11:16,360
if you aren't good at it. How do you know this game sucks? You play it yet? He did the thing. He

1384
05:11:16,360 --> 05:11:49,110
did the thing. What? That's good. Uh praise. You don't like the game. You don't like the game.

1385
05:11:49,110 --> 05:11:56,200
You want to participate in a tournament and fight and you just did. That's gonna be really. I can't

1386
05:11:56,200 --> 05:12:17,159
do that. You just did one. Alright now we need some real rest. This game is one of the best games

1387
05:12:17,159 --> 05:12:27,080
ever to watch. Um it's whatever man. Like I knew when this was coming out I was gonna play it a lot.

1388
05:12:27,880 --> 05:12:32,040
So this is what we're doing and if people think it's fun that's awesome because I think it's fun.

1389
05:12:34,630 --> 05:12:41,180
I love this game and we're going to beat this game. Not like last time. Last time I did B rank

1390
05:12:41,819 --> 05:12:47,540
and I stopped playing it. We're going to beat. We're going to get to at least A to S rank. We're

1391
05:12:47,540 --> 05:12:54,569
going to. But no I mean I was fucking around earlier right? Like if you don't like the game

1392
05:12:54,569 --> 05:13:04,729
and you think this sucks then it's alright. I'm still good. See you next time. Alright so we should

1393
05:13:04,729 --> 05:13:27,930
go to uh alright our entry time. Please. Skill and life. This is gonna be it. We're gonna learn new

1394
05:13:27,930 --> 05:13:40,310
move. Finally. You know what? Go kill one of these guys too. Like Norty. Go fucking strangle Morty.

1395
05:13:41,610 --> 05:14:11,099
We can handle Morty. Come on. Good. Good start. Really good start. Plus like 15 or something.

1396
05:14:11,099 --> 05:14:31,060
Plus 20. That's alright. The shark part I just have to. I got a skill? What? I didn't even see

1397
05:14:31,060 --> 05:14:41,029
it. I didn't even see it. I got a skill. Did I? Oh damn this is awesome. Alright come on. Give me

1398
05:14:41,029 --> 05:15:07,689
over 200 skill. I want to fuse this guy with somebody. Take out the sharks. Yes! Come on.

1399
05:15:07,689 --> 05:15:21,000
Keep going. This is huge. This is the last one. Gigantic crab. Oh he got knocked down. Is that bad?

1400
05:15:26,970 --> 05:15:35,990
Oh that's it? Did I get it? I don't know what counts as a success here. What's going on?

1401
05:15:38,540 --> 05:15:45,060
What's happening? Did I lose? What are you doing? What the fuck is wrong with you?

1402
05:15:45,779 --> 05:15:52,009
I wonder how many failure points are here and I think I just did it.

1403
05:15:53,819 --> 05:16:06,380
Fall down. One last punch. Dude get him. Oh fuck. I don't this. That's alright.

1404
05:16:09,270 --> 05:16:16,409
There was probably 10 different failure points there. It seems pretty strong. Praise. Praise.

1405
05:16:16,409 --> 05:16:25,479
Let's go take a look. I'm really curious. Did you just become top tier? Alright come on. What do you

1406
05:16:25,479 --> 05:16:48,840
got? Whack and stab. Oh thank god. Finally. It took long enough. Now I can actually hit people

1407
05:16:48,840 --> 05:16:59,180
without a problem. Hit percent A. It does withering and sharpness. Yeah we'll keep these two on.

1408
05:16:59,180 --> 05:17:09,930
Thank goodness. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Let's go. Okay there's a C today but

1409
05:17:09,930 --> 05:17:19,979
I can't do it. We'll try the C one next week. So let's take. Let's go rest. Take some nut oil.

1410
05:17:20,700 --> 05:17:38,180
Maybe some stress reduction. Keep the horror. Sure. I'm not doing that ever again. I want to get to

1411
05:17:38,180 --> 05:18:07,290
200. Is it next week? It's not. Wait is it next week? That's not. Good work. 200 finally. I think

1412
05:18:07,290 --> 05:18:19,020
I'm good for skill for now. And we're gonna do tablets and see if I can get a little bit more

1413
05:18:19,020 --> 05:18:33,779
power. Yeah I'm gonna do the heavy training I think because I need to hit harder. Alright so

1414
05:18:33,779 --> 05:18:49,990
it's rest. Is he ready for C? I don't know. I need more speed. What kind of monster feeds his pet

1415
05:18:49,990 --> 05:19:01,180
gummy vitamins for an entire month? I just pulled my first monster and all the stats were under 10.

1416
05:19:01,180 --> 05:19:14,200
That sounds awful. Let me take a look again. I don't think it's enough. I think we have to skip

1417
05:19:14,200 --> 05:19:25,669
this tournament. 300 power. Get back to over 100 speed. I need health too. Yeah I'm gonna skip the

1418
05:19:25,669 --> 05:19:37,740
tournament. When's the next one after that? Alright we're gonna be ready for the official one. So

1419
05:19:37,740 --> 05:19:49,099
we're gonna do some training. I want to get. Let's go for the heavy one. Come on don't fail it. You

1420
05:19:49,099 --> 05:19:56,520
can't fight every single week man. You can't fight. I keep losing loyalty because he wants to fight

1421
05:19:56,520 --> 05:20:24,439
every week. It's like you have to rest man. Get up there. 300. Close. Close. Errantry again. Look at

1422
05:20:24,439 --> 05:20:40,310
this. It's from Auntie Verde. She's having a sale at her shop. Oh that's. Yeah I need that. I use

1423
05:20:40,310 --> 05:20:58,259
these items all the time. How much is it per percentage? Great discount. Not that much. Like

1424
05:20:58,340 --> 05:21:09,580
10% off. 20% off. Whatever. I mean I need them. Alright don't run out of money.

1425
05:21:13,740 --> 05:21:19,369
20%. What's up with that? How much can I get for.

1426
05:21:23,669 --> 05:21:39,750
I don't want the chips. Okay so we're going to train speed. I want to get this back over 100.

1427
05:21:43,319 --> 05:22:15,159
Does that count? Truancy? It's what he took off? Rest. Your boy is soft. Try it again.

1428
05:22:15,400 --> 05:22:37,319
Don't run away this time. Nice job. Alright back up to over 100. That's good. Very important.

1429
05:22:37,319 --> 05:22:57,220
I'm running out of money. So we're going to do fish. Why are you playing with this dingleberry?

1430
05:23:00,150 --> 05:23:04,819
Jelly. He doesn't like jelly. But no wait no he does. He's the other one that didn't like it.

1431
05:23:05,779 --> 05:23:11,580
It's going to be a 24 hour stream. I don't think that would work considering I'm

1432
05:23:11,580 --> 05:23:17,180
streaming the game awards tomorrow. Only two more of those tops.

1433
05:23:17,819 --> 05:23:29,400
Official tournament. Let's see if we can get it. How much time do I have?

1434
05:23:29,959 --> 05:23:44,549
Alright so it's train train rest C. What are we doing here? Should I go for some omega speed?

1435
05:23:44,549 --> 05:24:00,490
Dump it into power. Health probably. I'll do health. Nah I'll do health. It's a good idea.

1436
05:24:01,130 --> 05:24:33,619
Don't cheat. You're cheating. But I'm not going to scold you. Dude I want to participate in a

1437
05:24:33,619 --> 05:24:50,360
tournament. Yes you can. No it's not even next week. It's the week after. Get it up over there.

1438
05:24:51,240 --> 05:25:27,900
I'm going to feed him a mango. But will that make him happy? Yeah have a mango. Maybe that'll make

1439
05:25:27,900 --> 05:25:39,479
him more loyal. Not really. Okay rest up. I don't think I'm going to be able to beat this. Maybe

1440
05:25:39,479 --> 05:25:48,540
I'll try one of the lower ones then. C rank or should I try for C rank? I need money. Ungrateful

1441
05:25:48,540 --> 05:26:25,659
prick. I'm going to get my ass kicked. I'm going to get my ass kicked. Come on. I got over 300

1442
05:26:25,659 --> 05:26:40,119
power. 200 skill. Sussvane had. Wasn't that bad. Okay Huey. I got that new move too. Jesus.

1443
05:26:46,979 --> 05:26:55,979
What do you have for intelligence moves? Do not go anywhere near. Holy shit I can't believe

1444
05:26:55,979 --> 05:27:11,369
anything hit by Garfield's fucking laser hands. Stab him. Stab. Oh god damn it. Holy shit do it

1445
05:27:11,369 --> 05:27:31,110
again. Stay in. Don't let him push you. That move is sick. Fuck. Don't let him hit you. Don't let

1446
05:27:31,110 --> 05:27:56,900
him push you. No don't get hit by his laser cannons. It's alright. I can still come in second

1447
05:27:56,900 --> 05:28:14,500
or third place. Sussvane didn't even hurt this guy. I want. I want one of those. I want one of

1448
05:28:14,500 --> 05:28:34,729
those monkeys. Alright. Recknen. What do you have for stats? I'm just barely not good enough for

1449
05:28:34,729 --> 05:28:42,229
this. Defense is terrible though. Just got to stay in. It's going to just come down to who hits who

1450
05:28:42,229 --> 05:28:45,590
because we both have the same amount of skill he has. We both have power. He's got more health.

1451
05:28:45,590 --> 05:29:05,430
Just stay in there and stab him. Good dodge. Fuck off. Fuck you. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails. Tails.

1452
05:29:07,990 --> 05:29:12,869
77. You won't swing the bat. Swing. I'm feeling like a fucking grandpa is yelling at a baseball

1453
05:29:12,869 --> 05:29:48,299
game. Swing. Hit him. Good. Get in there. Again. Stab. Fuck you. Hit him. Oh my fucking god.

1454
05:29:48,299 --> 05:30:00,279
Every time. It's just. Every time. Can I ever get this guy to have more than 47 percent? 50 percent?

1455
05:30:01,000 --> 05:30:05,979
I've been dumping and dumping and dumping and dumping and dumping stats into skill.

1456
05:30:05,979 --> 05:30:32,549
I got over 100 fucking extra points. I got to start winning games. Actually mad. Yeah I guess

1457
05:30:32,549 --> 05:30:41,990
I want to win. This is the guy that's beating everybody in with flawless victories. I'm not

1458
05:30:41,990 --> 05:30:55,700
even going to be able to get one. Well actually hold on. His defense is crazy. He's going to have

1459
05:30:55,700 --> 05:30:59,139
like a 30 percent chance to hit and he's just going to have to hit me one time and I'm dead.

1460
05:30:59,139 --> 05:31:33,580
Good luck. Can I dodge? My speed's awful. What is so confusing? No. Don't let him swing once. Back up.

1461
05:31:35,639 --> 05:31:50,970
Back up. Back up. All right go forward. Hit him. Back him up. Okay. I think I'm all right. Run in

1462
05:31:50,970 --> 05:32:18,090
and stab him. Oh my god. How do you miss this? It's impossible. I'm just holding left. Let's go.

1463
05:32:18,169 --> 05:32:33,849
We're good. I just can't lose. You literally fought a rock. Yeah and he was huge.

1464
05:32:37,049 --> 05:32:50,889
Sussvane is losing a lot. Yeah this Huey is going to win. He has like eight moves. He had this like

1465
05:32:50,889 --> 05:32:55,529
fire breath. He had a laser cannon. He had a dashing claws. I don't know. He was all over the place.

1466
05:32:57,529 --> 05:33:15,959
All right this is the monkey. I am very scared as I should be. I don't see how I win here.

1467
05:33:15,959 --> 05:33:31,209
But get lucky. Nice. All right. All right. All right. Hold off on the guts. All right. 60%. Keep

1468
05:33:31,209 --> 05:33:47,099
it going. Don't let him get near you. He is out of guts though. Four guts. Are you shitting me?

1469
05:33:47,099 --> 05:33:53,110
Just string it together. He can't do anything. Again. Again. Again. Again. Again. He can't do

1470
05:33:53,110 --> 05:34:11,000
anything. He has no. He has no mana. Dodge. What is so confusing? Oh what's he doing to my Wellington?

1471
05:34:11,000 --> 05:34:33,080
Come on. Got him. Why are you guys saying Trump? Did I sound like Trump?

1472
05:34:36,599 --> 05:35:12,279
I am actually still in this if I don't lose another one. Oh shit. He lost. Good. Okay. This

1473
05:35:12,279 --> 05:35:20,860
should be a pretty decent victory. This should be easy. He's the lost three times. Trump voice. I

1474
05:35:20,860 --> 05:35:45,720
need to hear this. I want to know what he's talking about. Why did I say that? What was that for?

1475
05:35:48,020 --> 05:35:57,580
Okay. Let's go. I think this guy's intelligence. I don't know how this person has lost three times.

1476
05:35:57,580 --> 05:36:02,389
Bad defense but everything else is really good. Even the power. All right. Well do not stay in

1477
05:36:02,389 --> 05:36:17,029
range of any green attacks so get the fuck in close now. All right. All right. All right. All

1478
05:36:17,029 --> 05:36:21,270
right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Just hit him one more time. Watch the guts.

1479
05:36:22,069 --> 05:36:26,310
Oh my god. What the fuck did he just do? You stupid game. This game's fucking rigged.

1480
05:36:26,310 --> 05:36:30,709
I can't believe it just died. Yeah. I literally just pressed one button and I died instantly.

1481
05:36:42,090 --> 05:36:48,040
How am I supposed to get away from that? I'm not an intelligence character so I just die?

1482
05:36:48,840 --> 05:37:06,659
I'm trying to stay in but he can like push it. Batman sucks. Yeah this is bullshit. I'm Batman

1483
05:37:06,659 --> 05:37:16,279
and go up against a bunch of fucking superheroes. Oh I got money and can aim good. Cool. These guys

1484
05:37:16,279 --> 05:37:37,610
have laser eyes. Your defense is too low? Yeah but it but okay. All right. Hear me out. Intelligence

1485
05:37:37,610 --> 05:37:44,779
moves. Defense means nothing. You only you take less damage from intelligence moves based on your

1486
05:37:44,779 --> 05:37:50,340
intelligence skill yourself. So if I'm not building an intelligence character then I'm gonna get

1487
05:37:50,340 --> 05:38:01,450
killed by the intelligence moves. You have no money and can't aim. So what are you? Um I don't know.

1488
05:38:01,450 --> 05:38:16,020
What? All right. This guy sucks except for his skill. He's just this is just a mirror match

1489
05:38:16,020 --> 05:38:33,139
except he's kind of better than I am. I would love to do a move. My guy doesn't know what what

1490
05:38:33,139 --> 05:39:03,720
fucking state he's in. I'm gonna get flawless now aren't I? My loyalty is not high enough so if I

1491
05:39:03,720 --> 05:39:26,900
try to tell him to do a move he blacks out. This guy's blacking out like 10 times a match because

1492
05:39:26,900 --> 05:39:32,979
we don't have a great relationship together or something. Why is he blacking out? Why is he so

1493
05:39:32,979 --> 05:39:48,419
confused? Into the freezer. No he's the best thing we got right now. I can't. I gotta at least beat

1494
05:39:48,419 --> 05:39:57,259
Zambor. Come on. It's time for some. All right how do I build loyalty? What's like the what what can

1495
05:39:57,259 --> 05:40:09,639
I buy him? What item can I give him to make him more loyal? Best you actually have is probably

1496
05:40:09,639 --> 05:40:40,380
Wellington. Probably actually. Don't come in last place I'll be happy. One more. Good. Oh shit.

1497
05:40:41,259 --> 05:41:12,220
Oh thank god. Uh I mean I I'm not gonna get any money but maybe I'll get fame.

1498
05:41:14,869 --> 05:41:30,009
Possible that I'll get fame? Hard to tell. How can you beat him without the last two?

1499
05:41:30,009 --> 05:41:34,630
Threw coins in the air and whatever one landed on heads three times that's the one I wouldn't.

1500
05:41:35,189 --> 05:41:41,750
He needs more loyalty that's why. The more loyalty he has the more. All right loyalty is like the

1501
05:41:41,750 --> 05:41:46,740
most important stat in my opinion at this point. Because if you tell him to do moves

1502
05:41:47,459 --> 05:41:54,069
and a third of the moves you tell him to do he doesn't do. I mean that's I'm just gonna that's

1503
05:41:54,069 --> 05:42:08,860
less damage. I'm not gonna get any money but will I at least get fame or something? I got 300 bucks

1504
05:42:08,860 --> 05:42:19,270
that's not okay I'm happy with that. Fame? What about auto fight? The problem with auto fight is

1505
05:42:19,270 --> 05:42:26,490
from what I've heard the CPU is notoriously notoriously unbelievably stupid apparently.

1506
05:42:26,490 --> 05:42:37,830
Like sometimes it just won't just will walk around it won't do anything. Very nice.

1507
05:42:44,580 --> 05:43:20,389
You tried. You tried your best. I need to win a tournament. Maybe this one or I gotta win money.

1508
05:43:20,389 --> 05:43:24,150
Well get him ready for this one. Should I just rest him up and just kind of fight the D?

1509
05:43:24,150 --> 05:43:34,009
I can't do crap. I'm not good enough for C. Maybe I should uh I need the I need $2,000.

1510
05:43:34,569 --> 05:43:49,560
It's so important. Rest him up. Get into that tournament and win. I actually will lose. I will

1511
05:43:49,560 --> 05:43:59,430
soft lock myself. All right let's go win this. You can't go lower than zero so don't worry.

1512
05:43:59,430 --> 05:44:23,099
I love this game. It's so much fun. I love just like needing to do better and try harder and train

1513
05:44:23,099 --> 05:44:30,700
better. You gotta make a golem or a jelly they're both pretty pog in my opinion. The naga is good

1514
05:44:30,700 --> 05:44:43,909
only once it's been trained to shitload. What don't okay so different types peak at different

1515
05:44:43,909 --> 05:44:53,580
places right? So from my understanding is some some of the base monsters like year one is where

1516
05:44:53,580 --> 05:44:57,819
you peak and you get the most amount of stat increases. Some of them are like year three near

1517
05:44:57,819 --> 05:45:03,819
old age you get the most amount of stat increases. Where what is this type? Is this later on in life

1518
05:45:03,819 --> 05:45:16,490
or third monsters have different growth spritz? Yeah so the base that I have here is peaking now

1519
05:45:16,490 --> 05:45:37,750
okay. Why are you doing the German explain thing? Dude you peaked in high school. I actually didn't

1520
05:45:37,750 --> 05:45:51,860
though. I peaked it I don't know like 10 to 5 years ago. I didn't peak in high school. I definitely

1521
05:45:51,860 --> 05:45:56,740
have passed my peak of I don't know I think maybe I'm coming down. I think I still got it though.

1522
05:45:56,740 --> 05:46:26,490
Did you see that tiktok orangutan dance? All right let's let's win. I need money. All right

1523
05:46:26,490 --> 05:46:47,159
bounce it back. Bounce it back. 40. I'm good. The thing is I'm not even ranking down to do this.

1524
05:46:47,720 --> 05:46:56,040
I haven't won a sea cup elimination tournament. So I mean like I got held back like six times in

1525
05:46:56,040 --> 05:47:17,479
the eighth grade. I'm still in the eighth grade right? Yeah I'm like 19 in the eighth grade.

1526
05:47:18,040 --> 05:47:40,709
Is that even possible? I don't think so. What happens? I don't think that happens. What happens

1527
05:47:40,709 --> 05:47:47,779
if you get held back like four times? Once you hit the soft cap for the first year you have to go

1528
05:47:47,779 --> 05:47:51,619
to the shrine and ask to reset there. I thought you're talking about what happens if you stay

1529
05:47:51,619 --> 05:47:56,569
back four times. You have to go to a shrine? I was trying to figure out what the fuck you're talking

1530
05:47:56,569 --> 05:48:11,669
about. Okay stay away from the intelligence moves I think. This stab is really good just to farm

1531
05:48:11,669 --> 05:48:20,220
these lower ranks though. These characters don't die. How long do the um what are the types that

1532
05:48:20,220 --> 05:48:43,159
I have? I think I have a wall right? The obsidian wall and it's a wall. It's a bug in Batman.

1533
05:48:43,959 --> 05:48:49,720
You have Wellington. I know but I have to make money. I have to make money and I have to get to

1534
05:48:49,720 --> 05:48:56,060
at least C or B rank so I can at least. This monster is peaking right now so I have to train

1535
05:48:56,060 --> 05:49:00,860
this monster. Try to win at least to like B or A rank so then I can actually get some cool monsters

1536
05:49:00,860 --> 05:49:18,250
and rare ones. I will let Wellington shine I promise. Maybe I'll combine them. Should I combine

1537
05:49:18,250 --> 05:49:54,540
Wellington and Bug Batman? Maybe I'll get maybe that'd be better. All right that's cute. Bye bye.

1538
05:49:54,540 --> 05:50:01,290
Uh Winston's passed away. You actually they actually can die. All right two thousand dollars

1539
05:50:01,290 --> 05:50:09,450
twenty two hundred maybe you'll get a little bit of fame. You have to get to at least C with this

1540
05:50:09,450 --> 05:50:13,369
monster. This game's like Dark Souls. You're supposed to just lose a bunch of times until

1541
05:50:13,369 --> 05:50:45,049
you get like the right combo. 2150. Go to Nagile whatever that is. Learned more? Yes.

1542
05:50:48,680 --> 05:51:00,569
You can't do a tournament back to back. No that. What's wrong with this guy? Why don't you ask me

1543
05:51:00,569 --> 05:51:17,659
that? Is it a re- what? Retire? You're not even two years old. What do you mean retired?

1544
05:51:19,450 --> 05:51:30,790
You're getting old? How long did they live? Are you shitting me? They die one year and eight months.

1545
05:51:31,270 --> 05:51:53,450
He's 68. You need to start training Bug Robin. Okay battle. When's the next- okay here it is.

1546
05:51:53,450 --> 05:51:57,049
He's gonna win this. He's gonna get to B rank. We're gonna freeze his ass and then we're gonna

1547
05:51:57,049 --> 05:52:03,400
combine him with Wellington and then we're gonna have a good base stats there. We'll take Wellington

1548
05:52:03,400 --> 05:52:09,509
all the way up to B rank. I gotta- I'm not gonna stop screaming am I? I'm like having two of a

1549
05:52:09,509 --> 05:52:27,689
time right now. I love this game. Uh I'll be all right. All right so this he's getting to the end

1550
05:52:27,689 --> 05:52:40,979
here. Well let's rest him up. See if we can take him to at least up to B rank which then combine

1551
05:52:40,979 --> 05:53:07,990
him with Wellington and see what we get. Go for it. All the way. Nice. Yeah we're really starting

1552
05:53:07,990 --> 05:53:22,380
to lose the uh prime there. It was like 18, 19, 18, 17, 18, 18. Now it's 9. All right but I don't

1553
05:53:22,380 --> 05:53:45,830
think I want to give anything too expensive. What's for dinner? I don't know. Train. Let's do- what

1554
05:53:45,830 --> 05:53:53,450
if I- I really need life maybe? At this point maybe I should just go all in on power. Just hope for

1555
05:53:53,450 --> 05:54:13,619
the best. What do you think? I gave him a cup of jelly for his last meal. He gets to eat- he'll eat

1556
05:54:13,619 --> 05:54:31,610
one more time. 300. Um I don't think I'll even be able to beat rank C. I think we freeze him now.

1557
05:54:40,040 --> 05:55:00,069
Past the prime here. 314. Seems well- not even tired. Get him- we'll get him in one more tournament.

1558
05:55:00,069 --> 05:55:29,930
What happens when they die? Um they die. Oh unless I freeze him. I can freeze him and combine him

1559
05:55:29,930 --> 05:55:40,099
which is what I'm gonna do that. That's kind of the point. I'm not gonna use any more stress

1560
05:55:40,099 --> 05:56:00,220
reducers on him either. Yeah there's a little funeral. There's a little like goodbye. All right.

1561
05:56:00,220 --> 05:56:17,189
Can we do it? Train twice. Rest. I'm just going straight power. Just power. There is no tournament

1562
05:56:17,189 --> 05:56:39,909
next week. Hope somebody freezes me when I get old and pass my prime. That was good. Seems well.

1563
05:56:39,909 --> 05:56:46,599
One more training session. This is the last time we will ever train this piece of absolute dog

1564
05:56:46,599 --> 05:57:19,029
shit. All right rest up. It's time to battle. I'm just kidding. I'm very fond of this uh this

1565
05:57:19,029 --> 05:57:29,939
little guy. Okay very well. Loyalty is pretty good. I don't- I think we're gonna get our ass kicked

1566
05:57:29,939 --> 05:57:50,380
but I'll try it. It's three moves and then into the freezer. Have increased my power by like 20

1567
05:57:50,380 --> 05:58:07,049
plus percent though. Some new faces here. All right. Xamber. Let's go. 330. High defense but

1568
05:58:08,040 --> 05:58:11,639
I do- I have a lot of power. Let's go for it. Let's see if I can just get in there and smash.

1569
05:58:12,360 --> 05:58:34,419
Don't want to get hit by that. Good start. Keep it up. Don't do anything yet. Go for it. Very good.

1570
05:58:39,779 --> 05:58:44,340
All right. Just hang back a little bit. Don't get killed. I need 14 guts to do this move.

1571
05:58:45,139 --> 05:59:01,830
Don't even you dare. Okay thank god. Win us a championship before retirement. Come on man.

1572
05:59:01,830 --> 05:59:16,950
You're gonna stream till like 12 a.m. Uh well we started really late because the game didn't come

1573
05:59:16,950 --> 05:59:26,139
out till 5 pacific. We will absolutely be playing this tomorrow. I have to beat the game. Tomorrow

1574
05:59:26,139 --> 05:59:32,700
is the game awards at 4 or 5 p.m pacific. I'll figure whatever it is. And then after the game

1575
05:59:32,700 --> 05:59:37,400
awards game awards are gonna be what like two three hours. We're gonna go right from the game awards

1576
05:59:37,479 --> 05:59:45,849
to this for like another three or four hours. We're 30? Yeah. Well we'll start around the same

1577
05:59:45,849 --> 05:59:57,459
time we did today. But I'm not done tonight. I still- I have- at least I want to get through.

1578
05:59:57,459 --> 06:00:12,150
I want to combine somebody and get a good round floor for the next monster. Yeah what is that

1579
06:00:12,150 --> 06:00:20,060
little thing? Offry? All right we got our ass kicked by Reckton last time. But it's a new day.

1580
06:00:20,860 --> 06:00:42,419
Just shred through that defense. It's a DPS race. I hope I can actually do moves. Dodge again.

1581
06:00:43,060 --> 06:00:49,099
Nice. All right. Okay okay okay okay. All right get in there. He's using all his guts.

1582
06:00:49,979 --> 06:01:18,500
Beautiful. All right this is good. One more. All right back it up. I- we're in pretty good shape.

1583
06:01:18,500 --> 06:01:40,950
We'll be at B rank. That little weirdo. Hey who said he was past his prime? Not yet. Another weak.

1584
06:01:41,959 --> 06:02:01,939
Maybe. All right this is the 2-0. Offry. I'm very curious of how strong you are. Okay you're very

1585
06:02:01,939 --> 06:02:09,659
very weak but you're impossible to hit. Stay in close. The intelligence moves are gonna kill me

1586
06:02:09,659 --> 06:02:28,970
in one hit. Get in close close close close close. Fuck! Stay in close. He can't even hurt you. Just

1587
06:02:28,970 --> 06:02:33,779
stay in close. Let the guts build up. He's gonna waste all of his toy hammer bullshit. Just don't

1588
06:02:33,779 --> 06:03:04,069
let him do an intelligence move. Okay get him. Yes! Take that motherfucker outside. Yes. Okay is

1589
06:03:04,069 --> 06:03:26,009
anybody else undefeated? Pivorous is currently undefeated. Pivorous. Not anymore. I'm gonna lose

1590
06:03:26,009 --> 06:03:41,459
to Sussmane. He's a mirror. Let's get in there. That's why you're so dangerous. You have a lot

1591
06:03:41,459 --> 06:03:51,509
of health. Not a lot of defense though. You're just a gigantic damage sponge. All right get in there.

1592
06:03:51,509 --> 06:04:09,020
Jesus Christ. Please. Watch that. I'm gonna build up guts. Don't just spam. This is how he wins fights.

1593
06:04:09,020 --> 06:04:17,270
He's just a like watermelon chewing gum. That's fine. Use it all. Go. I have to hit him like three times

1594
06:04:20,950 --> 06:04:32,330
and go. Oh get that. Get out of here. Now just don't die from. Now just let it just wait it out.

1595
06:04:33,659 --> 06:04:53,189
Stay in close and wait it out. Got it. Yeah you build up a bunch of speed. You build up a bunch of

1596
06:04:53,189 --> 06:04:58,860
health and then you become. You get hit two or three times. Doesn't matter. You can dodge the rest.

1597
06:05:10,939 --> 06:05:15,189
Is. Have I secured it? I think I have to win one more match and it's secured.

1598
06:05:18,459 --> 06:05:28,919
I know. Because if I have five wins it's impossible for anybody else to get to five wins right?

1599
06:05:29,479 --> 06:05:34,259
As long as he doesn't die on the floor then we should be fine.

1600
06:05:37,659 --> 06:05:46,939
If he dies in the arena then that's bad. I think can happen. All right here comes a real test. This

1601
06:05:46,939 --> 06:05:56,950
guy beat me bad last time. This is the monkey. It's gonna take a Christmas miracle to not lose

1602
06:05:56,950 --> 06:06:04,009
to this guy. I want to get hit by the intelligence moves so I have to stay back and then run forward

1603
06:06:04,009 --> 06:06:20,340
when I want to do something. All right back it up. I want to get hit by his INT move. What does

1604
06:06:20,340 --> 06:06:36,419
that do? They're booing him from eating a banana. Okay stay back. In. Back it up. That's fine. That's

1605
06:06:36,419 --> 06:06:51,540
fine. That's not a problem. Don't. There's so much. There's so much like tug of war going on here.

1606
06:07:00,360 --> 06:07:08,200
Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Holy shit. Thank god. That would have probably done 100 damage.

1607
06:07:08,279 --> 06:07:34,119
That was really really lucky. I win. Do I win? Okay. Reckonin? No. Pivorous needs to win the

1608
06:07:34,119 --> 06:07:46,139
rest of his games and Offry needs to win the rest of his games and it's a tie. Who's next?

1609
06:07:46,139 --> 06:07:51,180
Okay Reckonin needs to beat Pivorous right? Oh it's over. No. Okay. Reckonin needs to win right now.

1610
06:07:51,900 --> 06:08:03,099
There it is. Okay now Offry has to lose their next match. Zambor is lost every single time but

1611
06:08:03,099 --> 06:08:15,610
let's see. Well it's gonna be me versus Offry in the championship. Unless I win right now.

1612
06:08:15,610 --> 06:08:32,020
This is what it comes down to. This is to secure uh the C rank championship. I'm looking to try

1613
06:08:32,020 --> 06:08:35,939
to get hit by the INT moves if he has any on his bar which he doesn't so this is gonna be

1614
06:08:35,939 --> 06:09:09,740
just a fight. It's a mirror match. Good luck. Yes! That's it. C rank. C rank championship baby.

1615
06:09:09,740 --> 06:09:18,439
Hell yeah. It's the last thing this guy's ever gonna see unfortunately. Well no he's gonna

1616
06:09:18,439 --> 06:09:27,849
be combined. His DNA is gonna get combined with somebody else. I did not have any faith at all.

1617
06:09:27,849 --> 06:09:37,540
That was that was my mistake. I should have given him some um encouragement. Now we'll have access

1618
06:09:37,540 --> 06:09:52,650
to B rank which is great. If I go seven and oh though I'll get a ton of fame I think. All right

1619
06:09:52,650 --> 06:10:07,689
what is what monster is this? Nicole? It's like a cat. You're just hard to hit. That's all. Nothing

1620
06:10:07,689 --> 06:10:37,830
is too scary. Just have to hit you a few times. There's one. That's all I need. That secures it

1621
06:10:37,830 --> 06:10:53,450
I think. As long as I don't get hit by something horrible here. This just drains my mana. Still

1622
06:10:53,450 --> 06:11:09,939
win by percentage here. God you're a pain in the ass. Still win by percentage. Oh my god what I

1623
06:11:09,939 --> 06:11:21,659
don't I what's what's the percentage? Wow that was annoying. That was annoying. That's all right.

1624
06:11:21,659 --> 06:11:41,319
Sometimes a champion can't go undefeated. Let them play out the rest of the tournament. Whatever.

1625
06:11:44,979 --> 06:11:49,220
Why is the cat winning? Uh high speed and annoying moves that drain guts.

1626
06:11:52,389 --> 06:12:10,119
Nice work. Did he lose every single match? Zambor lost every match. I know what that's like. I can't

1627
06:12:10,919 --> 06:12:28,970
talk shit. Only 16 fame. I was almost undefeated in the tournament. Perfect. Perfect combination

1628
06:12:28,970 --> 06:12:42,840
here. Good job. You got us a B rank. You don't want to fight. You want to rest. It's time to rest.

1629
06:12:42,840 --> 06:12:54,869
What food are you gonna get? Uh I got five grand. Holy shit. I'm making money now.

1630
06:12:59,900 --> 06:13:15,700
Have a cup of jelly. You did good. Who is it? Oh I think this is it. Do I actually get to

1631
06:13:16,259 --> 06:13:33,610
become like an actual trainer? Rank three right? Oh yeah. Professional. I am now I can now open up

1632
06:13:33,610 --> 06:13:53,750
those other boxes. It's time for toxic. Very good job. Good work. So before we do anything let's

1633
06:13:53,750 --> 06:14:11,779
freeze you. I'll be using you later. Don't forget about spot. Yeah I gotta remember the exact ones.

1634
06:14:11,779 --> 06:14:24,299
All right the first one was spongebob square pants and it was the which one was it battle

1635
06:14:24,299 --> 06:14:50,169
rehydrated. All right this is this one. Generate. I'm not an authorized trainer. Very high level.

1636
06:14:50,169 --> 06:15:19,130
I need to have I need special rank. All right how about uh Christmas by Christmas by Paul Cardale.

1637
06:15:19,689 --> 06:15:53,380
What you got Paul? Cosmic stone. That's pretty good. 168 intelligence. Hold on to it for now.

1638
06:16:28,299 --> 06:17:11,909
Cosmic order. That's cosmic order. Cosmic calamity. Close enough. Cosmic calamity. All right freeze

1639
06:17:11,909 --> 06:17:23,020
this motherfucker. Wait hold on. Save the game. I'm gonna combine this and the and the other one.

1640
06:17:23,020 --> 06:17:29,619
These are really good base stats. If I combine this with the dragon this could be pretty big.

1641
06:17:29,619 --> 06:17:56,069
Save again. Okay let's do it. Yeah freeze. Cosmic Andy. Oh yeah Cosmic Andy. That's my favorite

1642
06:17:56,069 --> 06:18:18,810
character. I need something good. Bug Batman. Cosmic calamity. Doesn't know what the sub is.

1643
06:18:21,080 --> 06:18:41,029
What is that? That's a secret sub. See I saved it. That's a rare subtype. That's why it looks

1644
06:18:41,029 --> 06:19:00,069
cosmic. Crimson eyed. Oh that's already what Bug Batman already is a crimson eyed. No. All right

1645
06:19:00,069 --> 06:19:37,830
what about Wellington and cosmic calamity. Noodle and cosmic calamity. This can be used as secret

1646
06:19:37,830 --> 06:19:47,080
seasoning. Prospect here is unsure. Silhouette. I think I'm just gonna get cosmic calamity.

1647
06:19:48,409 --> 06:19:58,889
That's like a rare subtype. Why don't you just level that one up. I'm just gonna use the wall.

1648
06:19:58,889 --> 06:20:12,650
Why not? I might as well use it. Let's get really awesome base stats too. Yeah let's bring out

1649
06:20:12,650 --> 06:20:31,639
calamity. Let's go. 168 base intelligence. That's awesome. I'm sorry about the music. I can't help

1650
06:20:31,639 --> 06:20:58,939
it. All right let's go. What do you like? Likes meat and doesn't like tablets. Are you off putting?

1651
06:20:58,939 --> 06:21:07,020
Flattening and charge. No intelligence move. I need to we gotta get him out there. It's just way

1652
06:21:07,020 --> 06:21:46,700
too high. Study of the little bird. Scary. I almost fell out of the chair. I slipped. Try to

1653
06:21:46,700 --> 06:22:05,099
get him to 200 before we take him to a tournament. He's supposed to be smart. Let's do a little bit

1654
06:22:05,099 --> 06:22:21,130
of the mint leaf. Base sucks. Yeah it's scary. Definitely can't do F rank. Let's go. We'll do

1655
06:22:21,130 --> 06:23:02,680
this one. Should be all right. How do you cheat? Don't cheat. I mean don't cheat. Use that oil.

1656
06:23:02,680 --> 06:23:24,680
Academic dishonesty. Anyone know how long the walls live in general? You like meat. All right

1657
06:23:24,680 --> 06:23:48,250
we'll give you meat. Two weeks. 100 years. We'll do this one. Maybe we'll just wait till. I think I

1658
06:23:48,250 --> 06:24:00,759
could bring him now. He needs an intelligence move. I gotta look at his stats again. Once he gets to

1659
06:24:00,759 --> 06:24:04,680
200 intelligence I'm doing something else. Although honestly I really probably shouldn't even be doing

1660
06:24:04,680 --> 06:24:20,860
this because he doesn't even have an intelligence move. I should be doing something else. Health

1661
06:24:20,860 --> 06:24:54,659
probably. Health and skills. Whoa that speed though. Holy. Whoa that's bad. Seems well. When's that

1662
06:24:54,659 --> 06:25:03,529
battle? Nope. Yeah we'll just do the official one. I'm gonna keep doing this till he gets to 100.

1663
06:25:04,169 --> 06:25:34,919
He'll get hit by everything. I hate this wall. Take a hammer to it already. Health maybe? Yeah.

1664
06:25:34,919 --> 06:25:52,810
How does a wall run? He's cheating. Why are they? I have so many bad natured people. It's gold.

1665
06:25:53,369 --> 06:26:04,779
This looks like a PS2 loading screen. I know you don't want tablets but I'm gonna give them to you.

1666
06:26:05,419 --> 06:26:21,909
Tablets are always a good decision. The benefits well outweigh the fact that he doesn't like it.

1667
06:26:21,909 --> 06:26:44,500
Air entry? Yeah okay. I wonder. Should we just do it? I've got money. Should I just try? I know when

1668
06:26:44,500 --> 06:26:53,349
they're like a baby baby under under three or four months it's usually not worth it. I need an

1669
06:26:53,349 --> 06:27:03,209
intelligence move. Really bad. I have to get him an intelligence move. It's on sale right now.

1670
06:27:03,209 --> 06:27:26,259
It's just way too young. I'm gonna try to get the move. Will it not? It won't work.

1671
06:27:27,979 --> 06:27:45,590
Save and do it. All right so now it doesn't matter. I'll rest up though because I want him to be very

1672
06:27:45,590 --> 06:27:54,250
well rested. If I actually get an intelligence move this is gonna be huge. Sorry I swallowed the

1673
06:27:54,250 --> 06:28:07,659
back of my tongue. If I get an intelligence move it's gonna be huge. Okay. Int. There it is.

1674
06:28:08,459 --> 06:28:17,189
Go for it. There's a chance to acquire a new technique. You can fight that guy who cares. Go

1675
06:28:17,189 --> 06:28:49,610
for it. Monkey race. Beat him. Oh the block. Is that technically cheating? He's gonna be a big

1676
06:28:49,610 --> 06:28:57,619
deal now. I really hope that's an intelligence move because if it is then he's this is the new

1677
06:28:57,619 --> 06:29:17,000
this guy will bring us to be at least. We'll get B rank with this guy. Heard? Good job. Very good.

1678
06:29:17,000 --> 06:29:34,569
Very good. This is huge. Go all the way. Get another skill. It's all right. It's okay. It's

1679
06:29:34,569 --> 06:29:47,819
all right. You got to move. That's all that mattered. It's okay. Try again. Try it again.

1680
06:29:47,819 --> 06:30:08,340
There's another chance. Boom. Break out. Get out of the way. Dodge it. That's okay. All that matters

1681
06:30:08,340 --> 06:30:23,669
is the move. Good job. Nice work. Seems pretty tired. Give it some rest. What is the move?

1682
06:30:34,979 --> 06:31:16,200
Scratch. Why did you learn scratch? And it sucks. Okay. I can't do that. We're gonna have to do this

1683
06:31:16,200 --> 06:31:31,669
one. Round robin. Four entries. Thousand gold. Go for it. Speed again. Load the save. No I mean

1684
06:31:31,669 --> 06:32:06,939
he's got a new move. He gained a lot of stats too. Uh three weeks. Do some oil. What song was this

1685
06:32:06,939 --> 06:32:23,500
from? I think this is from Christmas by Paul. Something like that. Christmas by Paul. Did I

1686
06:32:23,500 --> 06:32:42,740
just rest? He's tired. Tired is he? Did I just rest? Or should I rest? I forgot. Build the loyalty up.

1687
06:32:42,740 --> 06:32:52,439
Yeah. Yeah I'm not gonna be left. I'm gonna stop the stream soon. We'll come back at it tomorrow.

1688
06:32:56,119 --> 06:33:10,540
Eleven thirty. Eleven. Okay. All right. Yeah we'll end. We'll end soon. Oh give him a cup of jelly.

1689
06:33:11,340 --> 06:33:20,419
Stress. I want to fight at least one time and then we'll end.

1690
06:33:20,979 --> 06:33:34,840
I lifted up. Your model is a rare class that's the highest ranked model type.

1691
06:33:36,229 --> 06:33:55,319
But your naga is a d-class and basically garbage breed. Really? Okay let's uh let's eat that

1692
06:33:55,319 --> 06:34:09,560
stress reducer. Train a little bit and maybe some intelligence. Thinking about maybe a little bit

1693
06:34:09,560 --> 06:34:17,000
of intelligence. Batman got farther than the dumb slab ever will. I don't I think he's gonna be

1694
06:34:17,000 --> 06:34:39,900
all right. All right battle is I don't know I don't have I gotta just do E.

1695
06:34:41,020 --> 06:34:49,610
I definitely do not have what it takes. Rest. Gonna go to bed? I will soon. Very soon. We'll

1696
06:34:49,610 --> 06:35:04,119
see it. We'll I'll be around tomorrow. Game words. It's bottom it's like bottom five monsters in the

1697
06:35:04,119 --> 06:35:22,950
game. Are you serious? That sucks. All right after this we'll I'll be done. This train a little bit

1698
06:35:22,950 --> 06:35:40,520
more and then we'll go from here. Maybe one more tournament. Maybe. I got a defense. I got high

1699
06:35:40,520 --> 06:35:58,729
defense. Let's try that new move. Scratch. I mean it's kind of funny looking. 85% you won't even

1700
06:35:58,729 --> 06:36:36,759
do anything. Come on man. Oh that hurts guts too. That move is fucking stupid. Good. Good. Be close.

1701
06:36:37,560 --> 06:37:06,439
Dodge it. I think that's a win. No more bets. Yeah no more betting. I want to get to a point

1702
06:37:06,439 --> 06:37:21,500
where I have 800 power and shit. You know what I mean? I've only peed once today. Or she drinks

1703
06:37:21,500 --> 06:37:34,900
some water. I drank water right here. Uh just go for the one that hits. Which is flattening.

1704
06:37:35,779 --> 06:37:59,619
Unless this little shit beat me please. Oh my god am I gonna lose for the first time ever?

1705
06:38:01,099 --> 06:38:27,290
The rabbit. It can't happen. He's gonna KO me. Do something. What the fuck? The rabbit is the

1706
06:38:27,290 --> 06:38:46,020
shittiest enemy in the whole game and I actually lost. All right I have to beat you. How did you

1707
06:38:46,020 --> 06:39:22,259
not get an intelligence move? I don't understand. Get it get it get it get it get it get it get it

1708
06:39:22,819 --> 06:40:14,700
combo combo combo combo. Back this shit up. No. 62% swing at him. 85. He just his loyalty is too

1709
06:40:14,700 --> 06:40:25,080
low. Tried to bring him in too early. Damn it. I thought I had that too. At least I get the money

1710
06:40:25,080 --> 06:40:44,310
back. It's fine. That's okay. Uh I'm not praising you at all. I'm sorry but you don't get praised.

1711
06:40:48,380 --> 06:40:55,270
Style even. I don't want to. The last character was so spoiled he wouldn't listen to half the

1712
06:40:55,270 --> 06:41:16,009
things I said. Send his ass on an errand tree. It's too expensive right now but I want to.

1713
06:41:16,009 --> 06:41:38,520
Official tournament. He's not ready. Actually just not ready. I need at least 30 to 40 loyalty. Not

1714
06:41:38,520 --> 06:41:54,490
worth it. I want to send him on an errand tree so bad. Not going to though. Don't do it. Just train

1715
06:41:54,490 --> 06:42:15,689
normally. I'll eventually get an intelligence move. I will. That was pretty good. How much garlic do

1716
06:42:15,689 --> 06:42:33,270
you have to eat to become handsome? A couple cloves a month. Eat the banana. I think the banana is

1717
06:42:33,270 --> 06:42:58,169
killing me. That's another good one. Probably seven or eight. Damn. Why buff intelligence with

1718
06:42:58,169 --> 06:43:06,549
no moves? Well because there's a certain finite amount of time in a monster's life that they will

1719
06:43:06,549 --> 06:43:11,590
gain stats. They'll gain way more stats than they would when they were a baby or when they're older.

1720
06:43:12,540 --> 06:43:19,740
So I'm just trying to dump intelligence into this motherfucker. So eventually when I get if I just

1721
06:43:19,740 --> 06:43:26,810
hammer intelligence I'll be able to get him an intelligence move and he'll have like 400 intelligence

1722
06:43:26,810 --> 06:43:43,700
and I'll laser beam people in one second and he'll be gone. Gone. Disintegrated. Intelligence again.

1723
06:43:47,450 --> 06:44:01,419
After this one I will. I'm gonna do one more tournament. No I'm not. Errand tree. He is.

1724
06:44:02,459 --> 06:44:09,159
Fuck the errand tree. Forget the errand tree. He's got so much health. So much. Not health.

1725
06:44:09,159 --> 06:44:22,470
Whatever. He's getting a lot of intelligence from this. Do it again. Just do it again. He's

1726
06:44:22,470 --> 06:44:55,159
killing it. Little ding. There it is. All right. I need an intelligence move. Okay. Probably.

1727
06:44:55,159 --> 06:45:09,979
Should I send him on an errand tree and just say screw it? And well I really want to unfreeze

1728
06:45:09,979 --> 06:45:22,259
Batman and do a tournament. Rest up. You're going on an errand tree tomorrow. If I lose all my money

1729
06:45:22,259 --> 06:45:27,779
whatever I'll just bring Batman out of retirement and just have him win a C rank or something or a

1730
06:45:27,779 --> 06:45:36,889
B rank or a D rank. Why are you even increasing intelligence? How smart do you have to be to just

1731
06:45:36,889 --> 06:45:43,909
crush someone? But look at him. He's made out of galaxies and planets and stars and stuff.

1732
06:45:43,909 --> 06:45:48,889
He's eventually gonna be able to learn a move that is gonna be like a galaxy bomb or something.

1733
06:45:48,889 --> 06:45:57,500
I don't know. He's like he's intelligence based right? All right let's save it.

1734
06:45:57,500 --> 06:46:13,270
Errand tree intelligence. Let's go. 2,000 bucks. Don't care. Intelligence. There is some chance to

1735
06:46:13,270 --> 06:46:39,450
acquire a new technique. Go after this guy. Come on. I'm looking for 10 intelligence each time.

1736
06:46:48,439 --> 06:46:56,970
Beautiful. Bruising past 200 plus intelligence at this young of an age. He's a little genius.

1737
06:47:01,380 --> 06:47:16,470
We got a raid? Oh shit there's a raid. Who raided? Oh shit. Atriarch. What's going on? Thanks for the

1738
06:47:16,470 --> 06:47:25,979
raid. We did it. That's a big raid. That's a lot of people. What's going on? Thanks for the raid man.

1739
06:47:26,619 --> 06:47:34,299
Playing Monster Rancher 2. The new meta of Twitch. Guaranteed. Don't let me be the one to tell you.

1740
06:47:34,939 --> 06:47:41,209
All right we didn't do this one last time. Stop doing that. I'm not doing a tuber voice. I'm just

1741
06:47:41,209 --> 06:47:45,819
being in person. He couldn't make it last time. He's gonna get up there this time. I guarantee it.

1742
06:47:46,619 --> 06:48:03,189
Do it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. Oh that's slick. Any new technique?

1743
06:48:05,930 --> 06:48:14,740
No new technique. Got one more chance. Big gorilla. He's gonna knock it out of the park

1744
06:48:14,740 --> 06:48:17,939
and he's gonna get an intelligence technique and everyone, all the haters, all the doubters,

1745
06:48:17,939 --> 06:48:34,919
are gonna be shut up right now. Welcome everybody. Did I hit him in the bum? I'm hot. This is to prove

1746
06:48:34,919 --> 06:48:43,740
how intelligent I am by fucking with a wild gorilla. Is this intelligent or is this really stupid?

1747
06:48:44,380 --> 06:48:57,400
Stop pretending to be normal. I'm fine. I'm not normal. He got it. I think he actually did it.

1748
06:49:01,110 --> 06:49:19,049
New technique. Oh shit. I have to fight this. Low defense. High health. I was gonna crush this guy.

1749
06:49:19,049 --> 06:49:38,729
Just scratch him and crush him. I don't even play. It's the computer. Fight him. Come on. Get in there

1750
06:49:38,729 --> 06:49:48,459
and smash. Smoosh him. The computer is so stupid. Stop just touching. Stop walking into him and crush

1751
06:49:48,459 --> 06:49:53,939
him flat like this. Like a pancake. There's no timer either. It's just something you have to die.

1752
06:49:58,840 --> 06:50:28,650
Do some other move please. He just has to hit it. Good. Not good. One damage. Attack him.

1753
06:50:29,209 --> 06:50:35,990
He probably has 80 plus guts right now. There it is. That's what we wanted to see. Do it again.

1754
06:50:36,630 --> 06:50:57,540
I don't think it's gonna happen. Come on. The scratch is the best move I have right now and

1755
06:50:57,540 --> 06:51:14,819
he needs to start using it or just bow. What was the bow for? Do something. Oh you did a move

1756
06:51:14,819 --> 06:51:47,340
finally. Great. Very good. It's close. Do it. Get him. Get him. Good. I have to hit him three

1757
06:51:47,340 --> 06:51:55,720
more times. Again. Do it again. This idiot has two other moves. He's not doing any of them.

1758
06:52:07,700 --> 06:52:12,180
He might actually win by doing this over and over again. He's clutching it out right now.

1759
06:52:13,060 --> 06:52:19,450
This could be huge. Alright. Yeah. Shoulder tackle. Shoulder tackle again. You got it in you?

1760
06:52:19,450 --> 06:52:25,529
He just fucking won. You just beat him. You actually just beat him. Actually just won.

1761
06:52:25,529 --> 06:52:43,990
Give me a new technique. I did the whole thing. Great Cosmic Calamity. It's an easy battle to win

1762
06:52:43,990 --> 06:52:59,639
against those guys. Let's go back. I didn't get prize money. Oh it was 50% off because we won.

1763
06:52:59,639 --> 06:53:07,369
Beated a wild monster. It's wonderful. It could not acquire any techniques but its

1764
06:53:07,369 --> 06:53:20,310
parent tree was very successful. It was. I think you can catch them. Pretty tired. Alright.

1765
06:53:20,310 --> 06:53:33,799
Look at this data here. This guy is going to be at 300 intelligence before the first

1766
06:53:33,799 --> 06:53:43,930
goddamn tournament. Go to YouTube and type worst monster rancher 2 monster. It's literally this

1767
06:53:43,930 --> 06:54:19,020
one. What? Is it actually the worst one? Do I just have this so wrong? But he looks cool.

1768
06:54:33,220 --> 06:55:02,150
Let me turn this down. I can't hear this. Raising the worst monster in the game. Are you fucking

1769
06:55:02,150 --> 06:55:09,689
kidding me? I know if it's too loud, too quiet, anything like that. It looks very well. What?

1770
06:55:11,610 --> 06:55:35,610
It's a good one. I must have done it. It's not what it can't be. What? It wasn't paying

1771
06:55:35,610 --> 06:55:52,459
attention at all. What does it say at the end? Plus three again. Plus three again. 500? That's

1772
06:55:52,459 --> 06:56:05,930
500. Plus three again. I want to hear him say. Plus one. What's wrong? We died. He's dead? What

1773
06:56:05,930 --> 06:56:17,450
do you mean he's dead? Cole, I'm sorry about Proxima. Is it actually the worst monster in

1774
06:56:17,450 --> 06:56:28,700
the whole game? This is the worst combination in the game. I'm way too invested. Read the

1775
06:56:28,700 --> 06:56:37,819
description of that video. Bugs and bad stat growth make Monal just terrible to try and raise.

1776
06:56:37,819 --> 06:56:45,110
Worse than Metalners since at least Metalner live a hundred weeks longer. We try to raise

1777
06:56:45,110 --> 06:56:56,040
Proxima the best we can and beat the major four. But what if they fix the bugs maybe in this release?

1778
06:56:58,540 --> 06:57:10,419
His first intelligence learned move he gets when intelligence and speed are over 400. Are you telling

1779
06:57:10,419 --> 06:57:28,520
me I gotta ice this guy because I can't even do this? Are you kidding me? Over 400 intelligence?

1780
06:57:28,520 --> 06:57:38,259
What if I get to 400? I'm gonna get him to 400. All right, so I get him to 400, which we're not

1781
06:57:38,259 --> 06:57:52,229
even that far away. He needs 400 speed. Oh, that is not gonna happen. Wait, it's 400 combined

1782
06:57:52,229 --> 06:58:03,529
intelligence and speed. So not 400 each. People are saying something about the Papa's Errantry?

1783
06:58:03,529 --> 06:58:10,020
You need to do the Papa's Errantry to unlock strange light, which is an int move in the slot

1784
06:58:10,020 --> 06:58:27,639
before scratch. Okay, so I think I'm there. All right, so I gotta get to 330 intelligence.

1785
06:58:27,639 --> 06:58:39,959
Easiest thing I've ever done in my life. Let's go. I gotta leave. I'm so sorry I just like screamed

1786
06:58:39,959 --> 06:58:49,900
in your ear. I did not think it was gonna be that loud. Yeah, it's time to go. It's time to go.

1787
06:58:49,900 --> 06:58:56,259
I'll be live tomorrow. We'll pick right up tomorrow. Don't worry. Read the comments on that video.

1788
06:58:56,259 --> 06:59:08,259
If you see this, it'd be so great to see playthroughs with all the unique monsters.

1789
06:59:08,259 --> 06:59:21,419
This is nostalgic. Oh, you guys. Well, you know what? I'll tell you. This guy, Jack of Hearts,

1790
06:59:21,419 --> 06:59:27,500
got Monster Rancher 2 channel pretty much like doing Monster Rancher 2 shit. It should fucking

1791
06:59:27,500 --> 06:59:47,130
stop for this person. Give us a delayed raid song. I'm gonna just put the camera off. Thank you

1792
06:59:47,130 --> 07:00:06,229
for the rain. I see Monster Rancher 2 tomorrow as well as the game awards. I don't know what

1793
07:00:06,229 --> 07:00:13,450
I'll do first. Probably game awards first. So I can just go right from that directly into this.

1794
07:00:13,450 --> 07:00:21,419
Game awards. Let me actually look that up and get a correct time for you here. Thanks for sticking

1795
07:00:21,419 --> 07:00:27,900
around this long. I'm surprised that this many people still here. It's very, very late, but I'm

1796
07:00:27,900 --> 07:00:33,529
gonna play this game a lot. At least get to the end. I can't promise there'll be a face cam on

1797
07:00:33,529 --> 07:00:41,590
every time, but you know, whatever. This game's incredible. It's a lot of fun. It's just a good

1798
07:00:41,590 --> 07:00:48,380
time, so we're going to keep having it. Yeah, that's it. We'll end it there. Game awards are

1799
07:00:48,380 --> 07:01:06,470
what time? They are 4.30? Yeah, 4.30. I'll be live at like 4.15 just to kind of chill and wait for

1800
07:01:06,470 --> 07:01:16,439
the broadcast to go live. So I'll be live at 4.15 Pacific time in the afternoon tomorrow.

1801
07:01:16,439 --> 07:01:21,529
Take care of yourselves. Thanks for watching, everybody. I'm gonna make sure I save the game.

1802
07:01:21,529 --> 07:01:31,819
That's so unfortunate. This is the worst thing in the whole game. I gotta get to S rank at least,

1803
07:01:31,819 --> 07:01:47,979
right? It's about the personality of the monster, not the stats. You make the story.

1804
07:01:51,560 --> 07:01:59,610
That's true. That is true. You do have a point. There was a lot of community subs today, too.

1805
07:01:59,610 --> 07:02:11,180
I'm gonna give a hundred, which is insane. It was a 75 community sub as well. That was Sovine and

1806
07:02:11,180 --> 07:02:20,659
then Arawani. Thanks, both of you. The monsters. Very, very cool. Atrioc, thanks for the raid,

1807
07:02:20,659 --> 07:02:24,979
too. You guys are still here from Atrioc. Thanks for watching. Thanks for sticking around. Maybe

1808
07:02:24,979 --> 07:02:39,880
we'll see you again, and we will see you tomorrow. He's spinning around in a circle.

1809
07:02:44,459 --> 07:02:48,700
It's very late. Nobody's really live right now, but I will send you guys... I'm gonna send you

1810
07:02:48,700 --> 07:03:04,020
guys to Miskiv. What are you doing, Miskiv? Art contest? I'm following... Yeah, Miskiv is live

1811
07:03:04,020 --> 07:03:14,169
right now. Go say hello. No, you can say that I missed him in Smite because I play that game

1812
07:03:14,169 --> 07:03:24,729
all the time and he didn't even ask to play with me, by the way. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Take

1813
07:03:24,729 --> 07:03:41,189
care. Have a great night. Drama. Peep the horror. No more horror peeping. I'll see you guys later.

1814
07:03:41,189 --> 07:03:46,549
Have a great night. Why is this... Five seconds. What do you mean five seconds? What are you talking

1815
07:03:46,549 --> 07:03:53,290
about? I just said raid. What? Okay. For a second, I thought it was raiding in five seconds. I didn't

1816
07:03:53,290 --> 07:04:03,689
have time. Everyone relax. We're fine. See you tomorrow for the game awards. Good night. Goodbye.

1817
07:04:03,689 --> 07:04:11,740
Take care of yourselves. Go say hello to Miskiv. You better get me at least 7,000 viewers. Otherwise,

1818
07:04:11,740 --> 07:04:21,939
come on. There's gotta be 7,000 people going over there. I'm not... You have to. I just told you.

1819
07:04:22,580 --> 07:04:28,229
Come on. Do a reverse raid song. Okay.

1820
07:04:36,549 --> 07:04:52,970
Did you tell what I said? I am excited for the game awards tomorrow even though I played literally

1821
07:04:54,009 --> 07:05:02,659
probably one game that came out in 2021. I'm gonna have no idea what to even say.

1822
07:05:05,080 --> 07:05:32,060
All right. Goodbye. Good night.
