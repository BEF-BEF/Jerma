1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:15,539
How are you doing? Good. Really, really good. I'm glad to hear it. This stream is going to be

2
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:30,170
bopping in the next minute or two. Tonight we're going to do Connect again, but we're going to be

3
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:43,500
focused. Laser focused. Horror games. We've got quite a selection. There are two. Blockjam,

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:53,460
blockjam! There are two of them, and one of them has really bad reviews, and the other one

5
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:01,640
has really good reviews. So we're going to do them both, because that's what we do here. We explore

6
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:16,280
the entire gaming atmosphere, and I've got an even better hair solution today. I'll show you

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:25,159
in just a second. Oh, and by the way, if you're good, I'm going to show you something remarkable

8
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:43,340
later. Only if you're good. Only if you're good. I got my coffee. I've got my large water.

9
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm never going to be good. Well, you better be good. If that guy that said that is not good today,

10
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:06,090
it ain't happening. We're going to start with Rise of Nightmares. It's going to be a coin flip to

11
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:14,759
which one of these sucks, but I'm, I'm going to give it some time. I also lowered the, I lowered

12
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:22,229
the volume of the lights in the room too. I don't want it to be too loud in here. And yes, there are

13
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:31,110
some denominations. Sound is, it can be used as volume. That's a scientific term. It's DB.

14
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:50,229
Let's go. Why did it just spit it out? Get in there. So here comes Rise of Nightmares. We're

15
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:59,879
going to start off like this. You should see it right now. You should also see me. Uh oh,

16
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:11,030
they don't see me. Hold on. I gotta like fix this. It looks like I have a warped head. I promise I

17
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,939
don't have a warped head. I had to have some kind of solution. Oh, this is going to be up

18
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:24,979
a little higher. What the fuck is this doing? All right. No, no, no. The connect is moving.

19
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:40,599
The connect is moving on its own. Okay. Is that better? Extend your hand forward to start.

20
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,479
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta make sure this is in the right spot.

21
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:52,340
That looks all right. Is it too loud? Well, it's a horror game. It's supposed to be fucking loud.

22
00:03:53,719 --> 00:04:08,680
You don't turn the volume down on a horror game. You turn it up. Today we're going to play as Dave.

23
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:29,829
All right. Will you? I'm going to recalibrate this thing. It's been a week. Great new saying.

24
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:33,990
Yes, please do. Is that one like holding your hand this way?

25
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,620
Wait, position check. You are, you are now in the optimal play area. Extend your arm forward to

26
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:58,550
begin. This is matched up. Should be. Did you hear it? Brightness. Adjust the brightness of

27
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:07,769
the triangle edge is visible, but the inner crest is not. I need, I need to be able to see. You know

28
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:15,750
what I mean? I don't know how people play horror games like this. Why would you ever turn it down

29
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:25,079
like this? You can't see shit. You can't even play the game. All right. We're going to go right there

30
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,319
because I can, I can see the outline. That's better. Hold on.

31
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:37,620
And oh, it feels good every time. New game. All right. Play from the very beginning. I'm going

32
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,379
to get ready because this is going to, this is going to scare my socks off. Wait, this is good.

33
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:49,240
The camera's on a good spot. Wait, I feel like I'm going to like send a fucking like birthday

34
00:05:49,240 --> 00:06:10,170
greeting to grandma. Wait, hold on. Okay. Hey, grandma happy? No, a little lower. No mercy humane

35
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:21,420
or, or every time streamer says something that has any base in science at all. Anytime streamer

36
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:30,199
says something that you disagree with. Anytime a streamer says something that you didn't know

37
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:48,060
before, but now you know now. No mercy. Is no mercy. Okay. This the game of difficulty can be

38
00:06:48,060 --> 00:07:00,649
changed. Yeah, that's fine. Let's go real quick. This one's for moving. This one's for grooving.

39
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:10,279
You know what I'm saying? That's dope. Don't even need it. Oh, he's going to spill it and

40
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:29,290
it's going to be hilarious. Oh Christ, he barked. He said something. Turn your shoulders left and

41
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:37,540
right to rotate the camera. What was this shit? When you extend and hold your arm out towards the

42
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:45,620
screen, the target pointer will be displayed. Interact with any object that has an interaction

43
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:55,050
icon. I don't speak French. Thank God it's you. I didn't think anyone else survived.

44
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:07,449
She's going to get like grab. When you extend and hold your arm out towards the screen,

45
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:19,019
the target pointer will be displayed. There's a pipe. I didn't even pick that up. By holding

46
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:24,620
your arms like you're boxing, you will do a fighting stance. You can attack by swinging

47
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:40,500
the weapon you're holding. Okay. Hit the chain. Hit the chain. It's a cut scene.

48
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,470
Chains holding door shut can be broken with a weapon. First hit. All right, now go on.

49
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,230
Try opening this door just like you would in real life.

50
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:11,139
How do you move? How do you walk? How do you walk? To move forward, place a foot out in front of you.

51
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,899
Your speed changes based on how

52
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,610
Why am I walking like that?

53
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:53,580
What the fuck is that? Stop doing that. I'm like the Warner Brothers frog. This is fucking odd.

54
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:13,399
All right, hold on. Walk? What the fuck? I can't move around. What? When you see an auto movement

55
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,600
icon displayed, hold up your right arm to move automatically. Yeah. Let's go. Automatically,

56
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:35,539
please. Again, there ain't no way I'm going to be able to do this. Somebody in here? Oh,

57
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:54,340
there is somebody in here. Open the door. All right, here we go. No. Can you get me back on

58
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,539
track, please? Thank you. Can you do that again? Just get me back on track. I would appreciate it.

59
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:10,230
Okay, thank you. Oh, you just hold it. You don't have to actually walk. You just slide your foot out.

60
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:32,519
You can't open that door. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I go this way. Wait, wait, there's a thing. Pull

61
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:40,279
it down. When the icon is displayed, you will need to perform a situational gesture. It's a pole.

62
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:55,049
Uh-oh. I'm glad they closed the doors behind them. While in fighting stance,

63
00:11:55,049 --> 00:12:19,240
you don't want to make them focus. All right, that feels all right. Now what? How do I get

64
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:45,590
over there? I pull the lever. Oh, there's another guy right here. Who's next? Can I run? Or do I

65
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,950
just have to walk like this? Turning? You won't be able to turn while focusing. Remember to drop

66
00:12:50,950 --> 00:13:17,029
both arms when you want to turn. Oh. Like waiting for your children. Got it. Open the door. That's

67
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,950
bullshit. All right. Let me tell you something. If you like are like a building contractor or

68
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:27,429
you're like an architect, handle is pulled. Plate is push. I don't know. How the fuck do we not

69
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:40,250
understand this? It's been like 60 years of this. What am I supposed to do in here? And sometimes

70
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:46,570
some buildings have half of them are push for plate and half of them are like push. They go

71
00:13:46,570 --> 00:14:00,649
half and half. It's fucked up. Why am I in here? Just do it for me. But that went both ways.

72
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:22,600
That door is on like an axle. Do it for me. Hey, it's me. I got you. Now what? Are you going to

73
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:37,740
follow me? What are you saying? You're an autopilot. Big bits can't rule. Shit. I can't do it.

74
00:14:46,039 --> 00:15:10,470
Oh, it's one of those monsters. Where did you go? Where did you go? How do you run?

75
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:32,580
It's blood. I don't like this. I don't like blood. Oh shit. Okay, I can do it.

76
00:15:53,399 --> 00:16:12,070
Well, we both died. Now I'm going to be a reporter coming to investigate the scene, right?

77
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:26,490
The ice has already melted. It's so hot here. All right, that was a cool game. What's next?

78
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:45,110
This. For like the next seven to twelve hundred. I'm going to be a reporter. Come on. Notice how I

79
00:16:45,110 --> 00:17:03,179
said seven to twelve hundred. That is seven with no digits after it. Oh shit, the walls. The train.

80
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:21,480
The world. Who's in your jacket? I take my eyes off of you for

81
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:33,539
why would you take it out of your pocket? I didn't mean you should start hiding it.

82
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:45,299
I hate sounding like a nagging wife, but I've been putting up with this for five years.

83
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:55,109
When do you grow up? Excuse you. But I can't with you at the bottom.

84
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:59,910
We don't typically listen to private conversations. I can't do this right now.

85
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:06,059
Kate, I'm sorry. I was just completely eavesdropping in front of you of your

86
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:13,779
private conversation. All right, let's go. I need to wake up. Head to the bathroom.

87
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:29,849
Bathroom. You don't want to pause menu, but okay. I am like drunk right now.

88
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:54,329
Where's that bathroom? Look at this one. It's going to go. Ready? One, two, three. Into the mirror.

89
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:26,569
What were you drinking? Did you have horns? Find Kate. Looks like your

90
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:45,880
sotsuwara wrote you a message. What did you do? What did you do? You did something. Help.

91
00:19:51,480 --> 00:20:01,619
Where's the letter? Sorry, I got angry myself lately. Meet me in the dining room. Kate,

92
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:08,410
you used way too much paper for this. Now, the way to correct this would be to write it gigantically.

93
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:20,980
Like a second writer. I would not be as angry as I am now. Head to the dining car.

94
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:41,480
It's very difficult to navigate. All right. Wait, stop. Stop. Don't walk into the wall. I'm not moving.

95
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,890
Look out the window. Looks like it's going to rain. I guess the weather has a sense of humor.

96
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:01,240
Are you going to achieve it by looking out the fucking window?

97
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:05,819
God, they really tacked these on back in the 360 day. Remember this shit?

98
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:19,740
Oh yeah, this game has 120,000 achievements. Five points for shooting your first round.

99
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:51,579
Can I go? Can I pass this? Can I like go by? Excuse me. I'd like to pass. Can I like,

100
00:21:52,539 --> 00:22:03,880
what do I have to do? Is this going to teach me how to like crouch? I actually have to. Are

101
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:24,200
you serious? Why wouldn't you just put your down to the leg? What's so funny over here? Hey. Hi,

102
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:51,660
guys. Yeah. I know this trick. They did this shit weekend at Bernie's. That guy's not real.

103
00:22:51,660 --> 00:23:30,339
That guy's not alive. There's somebody up in the luggage cab. Are you on a phone? I'm just

104
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:45,460
rude. Oh, sorry. These old Soviet rail cars buck like shop shabonies. So who's this? I'll see you

105
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:55,990
around. I'm missing something, right? I'm missing something. That was like the oldest trick in the

106
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,269
book. That's the like I bumped into you and like my colleague came and like wrapped like something

107
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:16,779
that he backed back. What am I doing? What was I supposed to? I was supposed to find like the

108
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:30,619
dinner car. It's taking a lot more time than I thought it was going to take. Put it in there.

109
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:50,220
Oh, we got somebody in here. How are you? I'm a friendly bunch. Actually, I'm Canadian.

110
00:24:51,740 --> 00:25:08,579
Fucking assholes. Appreciate. Oh, right this way, sir. Come on, tell me where to go. I must

111
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:18,410
see your ticket. I just dropped everything. I'm not going in there. You can't pass without your

112
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,210
ticket. Well, you just it's in there. Can you just like, can you go in there?

113
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:38,599
Can you like knock on the curtain to find your wife? What the fuck? That guy's waiting up there.

114
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:48,339
He's probably like, what the fuck's going on in here? This will help. Sir, did you get your ticket

115
00:25:48,339 --> 00:26:01,240
yet? Shut up, man. This is cool. Which card should I? This card is your pass. This is very good.

116
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:13,859
You love your wife very much and she loves you. This is the present. All right, it's going to be

117
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:30,440
go on. Turn it. Fucking joker. This is your problem. Somewhere you have lost your way.

118
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:42,549
Next one's gonna be death. Don't worry. We still have future. Oh, my fucking god is the death card.

119
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:48,250
Did he get it? The alak, the alak is the ala was it the alchemist?

120
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,769
Somebody's giving like 60 fucking something.

121
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:07,339
If I like to religious give 69 something. Jesus. That's a lot. On top of the two plus hundred,

122
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:13,579
I think that you were responsible for already. Thank you. That is a shitload of subs. Oh,

123
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,140
yeah, sorry. I'm sorry. I just said there's something going on there. I had to do that real

124
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:34,759
quick. Always predict doom and gloom, but nothing comes of it. I mean, I just, I thought, I swear.

125
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:44,809
Dude, I'll give you 100 bucks if you eat that pen. All right, I can't even fucking look at it.

126
00:27:44,970 --> 00:28:03,109
Let's go. How many cars are there? I probably shouldn't be holding like a hot coffee in my hand.

127
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:11,619
This is like a jump scare game. Right? Okay. This is the worst thing you could possibly do.

128
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,829
Did I ever tell you guys the idea that I wanted to do, but I never did it because I just I'm just

129
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:23,589
full of empty ideas. I wanted to play a horror game. This is back in the YouTube days. I want

130
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:29,349
to play a horror game and have various annoying things in my lap. Like I have to think of popcorn

131
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:34,230
that when I jump scare the popcorn goes up on me, get like a stand up mixer and be like making

132
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,750
fucking good cookies and batter and shit. And I've been another jump scare like, oh, the cookies and

133
00:28:37,750 --> 00:29:02,650
batter went all over me. What am I doing here? Here's my ticket. Excuse me. I'm Canadian. Why

134
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:31,819
does this keep happening to me? Forward. No, go forward. Kate, Kate, where are you? Help. Help me.

135
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:41,589
I can't do it on my own. Is there blood? It's a lot on the train. Hold on. This is important.

136
00:29:41,589 --> 00:30:12,809
I gotta get ready for this. Okay. I'm gonna go talk to security because you're just happening

137
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:34,099
back there. Can I do anything with this stuff? All right, I'll go in. Bartender joke. Anybody

138
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:44,569
need anything? All right, let's go in. Here we go. Scary horror game. I said I was going to play it

139
00:30:44,569 --> 00:31:30,230
and I'm like, I'm pumped up. I'm hype. Oh shit. It's scorpion in the $12 skin. Get the fuck out

140
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:56,569
quick. That guy's got money. Get out of here. That's how tacked on these achievements are.

141
00:31:56,569 --> 00:32:06,490
That achievement was just called the train. I didn't fucking do anything. The train. I got 10 points.

142
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:18,819
God, what about Kate?

143
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:28,500
Escaping from the train. It's right, I can get out right there.

144
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:50,380
Bleeding in blood. Where are you? Restricted. Restricted auto. There are some situations

145
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:59,420
when you won't be able to auto move. Okay. Where is this person? Oh, I found the exit.

146
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Drop the jump. God, I really shouldn't be drunk doing this. I didn't think I was that drunk.

147
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:39,930
I knew it. Stay balanced? How is that not balanced? I was doing the pencil.

148
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:48,519
Do I have to put weight down on my right foot? Stay balanced.

149
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:13,690
Train. Okay, I gotta go left. Why can't I do auto movement? Okay, balance. Stay to the left.

150
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:35,769
Good. All right, let's go. Okay. Should I go try to get the secrets over here on the left?

151
00:34:36,489 --> 00:35:01,659
There's no secret over here. This shit's gonna make me sick. All right, now where?

152
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:36,039
I'm good. I'm good. Stay, stay, stay, stay. Okay. Okay. He walked backwards off the train.

153
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,300
He walked backwards. I put my foot forward. You saw it. I walked fucking forward. Why can

154
00:35:44,300 --> 00:36:12,869
you even walk backwards? Oh, no. I got Luigi. How do I run? The whole game that you're supposed

155
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:16,869
to go like put your foot forward to automatically move. Now I have to all of a sudden run?

156
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:26,619
All right. This is how you move the whole game. Now fucking sprint, dude. Hurry.

157
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,280
Hurry.

158
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:29,639
Achievement. Run for it. No. I'm just standing very close to the fire.

159
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:37,659
No. Why would you throw the phone? People always do that in fucking movies and TV shows.

160
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:43,260
What if it works? What if you get a signal over here? Like 100 feet that way.

161
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,980
In the middle of nowhere in a fucking cave. You relax.

162
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,420
Somebody's going to come for us. I mean at least I take pictures of shit on your phone.

163
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,940
Like document our trail so they can figure out like what happened.

164
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,340
And then once you document the whole trail throw it as fucking far as you can

165
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,300
and it'll get washed up with somebody going to decipher the photos and find you.

166
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:23,210
He thinks it's dangerous to go out there at night. I'm studying foreign languages.

167
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:31,369
Romanian is one of them. Great. Derailed into a cursed forest. This keeps getting better and better.

168
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,329
I thought that was the person in the fire.

169
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,099
I thought it was the person in the fire. I thought that guy was on fire.

170
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:58,059
Oh shit. I got too close. Let me lead the way. So we've got. We should stay together. The old man.

171
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:09,190
The train conductor. The badass. The college educated. The journalist. There's one more.

172
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:27,030
There's one more. What's the last one? I can't. I physically cannot see this. It's so blurry but

173
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:40,219
from back here. The funny guy. Wait is that me? Are we supposed to go over here?

174
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:51,719
I just felt something grab my.

175
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,679
Already. And then. Okay now we got some train conductor. We don't care apparently.

176
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,460
Nobody is upset about the fact that the train conductor just literally got sucked underneath.

177
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:31,699
A giant alligator. What? What? What? Get him off me. What's on me? I'm coming in leeches.

178
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,219
Oh no I can't do that right now.

179
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,820
All right if I just stood there. Would everybody have just gotten all their blood drain.

180
00:40:54,179 --> 00:41:02,179
By the way you cannot slot off leeches. It doesn't work like that.

181
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:11,420
I sensed a presence behind me. Like I was being watched. But though I spun and looked often.

182
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:17,179
All that I could see was the perpetual gloom of the forest. But I'm certain of it.

183
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:23,179
Someone is next to go. I've been doing this long enough to know that I'm not just spooking myself.

184
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:28,780
I think this guy is next to go.

185
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:55,340
See he's first. No no no go forward. This bottle. I think there's someone up ahead.

186
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:11,989
Come on I'm always the last person. What did you guys see? Is there a person right here?

187
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,940
Oh it's the fortune teller. Okay.

188
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:33,139
I want somebody else to do their fortune. It's just a bunch of gold.

189
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,099
Oh it's the fortune card. It's the gold card. You're gonna make a lot of money.

190
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:42,869
They're like oh cool. They get on the fucking helicopter at the end and leave.

191
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:53,369
What the hell is going on? Is it a hub?

192
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:24,309
All right let's talk. Don't punch guy in head. I saw interact.

193
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,610
Well now that you made it seem like it. Now that you gave me an opportunity.

194
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:36,250
Like I kind of have to know. Shit traveling through Europe seemed like such a good idea.

195
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:45,500
You can't. You cannot. I know everybody wanted me to try so I did.

196
00:43:52,659 --> 00:43:59,019
It's a fortune teller went down here. That's what I'm understanding right?

197
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:25,420
Just do it for me. I don't want to walk down this. Oh god did that one just move? What's in here?

198
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:32,820
Is a body in here? Who is this?

199
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,980
This is not working. Do I need a weapon or something?

200
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:17,210
I did it. All right so that doesn't count. That negates each other. Oh god just go.

201
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:24,460
How many times do I have to punch something in the face? Is there a dodge mechanic that I didn't see?

202
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:46,119
I'll handle this. This cannot be happening. Nice got it. All right anything else in here?

203
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:54,900
Health potion? Okay let's go. Here comes a jump scare. Here it comes. Just want to make sure.

204
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:13,619
Got it. Did you just lock me in here? What's wrong with you? Why would you do that?

205
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:28,710
Block attacks? How do you block? I'm just gonna go for it.

206
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:46,539
Even doing anything? Why is it still fighting?

207
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:03,820
I you get rid of the brain. You get rid of the head and it's gone. What?

208
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:22,949
Your brain is in their legs. I didn't even get the fucking knife.

209
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:33,900
No I'm getting out of this. I'm fucking winning this. No we're not next. We're not going to the next one.

210
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:53,239
I have to kill these three zombies. Okay here we go. Here we go. Let's do it. Get out here.

211
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:31,420
What armor for? Good. Go. Open the door. Out. Forward. Just go forward. Watch out. Watch out. They're gonna come up with us.

212
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:57,769
This is fucking ridiculous man. I'm just gonna. No. What? What?

213
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:25,739
Can I leave? Open the door quick. All right. Out. Out. Out. Out. We're good right?

214
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:54,219
Something's coming from behind me. What happened? Escape? Oh he's got acid.

215
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:28,460
How do I get out of here? Iron pipe? Give me that. Get the pipe. Okay good. Out. Just go. You kick your enemies.

216
00:50:43,099 --> 00:51:10,760
What the fuck? No I'm getting out of this fucking cemetery. Not yet. Not yet. I gotta get out of

217
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:26,230
the cemetery first. Here we go. I'm getting out of here. What are you doing? Go forward. Why am I moving

218
00:51:26,230 --> 00:52:02,739
backwards? I need that pipe. Man why is there so much acid? Go forward. I don't even care.

219
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:07,269
All right. I'm just gonna kill this thing. I'm not gonna do the tutorial kick.

220
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:50,059
Now focus on the person over that way. They're this way. Turn. What? Put your hands up. Watch out.

221
00:52:50,059 --> 00:53:31,610
The chest. A bunch of chests. How do I open these? Oh shit. This is not good.

222
00:53:49,289 --> 00:54:03,400
No. I have to get out of here. I have to get out of this. I have to.

223
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:36,230
Okay give me the pipe. I still am moving backwards for some dumb reason.

224
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:46,949
Hey shit. Hey shit. Shit. Get the machete. What? Hey shit. Get the machete. What do you mean? Hey shit.

225
00:54:47,909 --> 00:55:05,929
Where's the machete? Hey shit. Get the machete. I don't see a machete. Hey shit.

226
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:15,030
Lower the difficulty. Just too late. I'm going for it. All right. I can do it. All right. I'm gonna make

227
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:32,889
it. This is where we go. Fight. Just kill them. Hands up. Why are you backing up?

228
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:23,300
Go. Hey shit. Hey shit. Where is it? Is it over here? I don't see a machete. What's that?

229
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:51,829
Iron pipe. I got two pipes now. Can I do both hands? Let's go. All right. This is where I died

230
00:56:51,829 --> 00:57:16,090
last time. Hey shit. What's going on?

231
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:25,960
There is some fatigue in this.

232
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:29,960
It just suddenly came back to life.

233
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:39,380
Where the fuck is it? Man.

234
00:57:48,019 --> 00:57:51,619
I didn't kill this guy. Get rid of the arm.

235
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:54,579
It's enough to order to make me forget about this job.

236
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:56,820
Yes. Cut its handle.

237
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:11,940
Did I win? Oh my god. Oh my god. What the fuck?

238
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:18,599
Let's go.

239
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:51,019
Still. Where is he? Where is my weapon? I can't see. Knife arm. Get it.

240
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:31,820
Can I please be done with this? Oh, thank God. No. Jesus. Okay, that was

241
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:58,070
That was fucking brutal.

242
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:10,050
He's doing a lot of good Arnold noises there.

243
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:26,050
He looks like a fucking jester.

244
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:26,889
Oh, shia!

245
01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:41,340
Uh-oh, it's the mad doctor.

246
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,179
That guy had pretty weak arms.

247
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:46,619
That was like, he was doing like a little tap.

248
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:59,559
What is this for, right?

249
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:00,760
They always have like the crazy,

250
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,079
fucking butcher doctor psycho in all these things.

251
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,559
What are you doing this for?

252
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,349
That wasn't an experiment.

253
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:20,750
He just put an ax in that person's head.

254
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,030
That was not like, oh, and I'm doing a test

255
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:25,349
on the globulation of human skulls.

256
01:01:41,389 --> 01:01:44,710
He was always fucked up using the background.

257
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:55,059
Why can't it be like, like a top 10 song?

258
01:01:55,059 --> 01:01:57,139
He waves first.

259
01:01:57,139 --> 01:01:58,780
Wait, instead of waving, just get it done.

260
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,380
Like, oh, hey, I'm about to say,

261
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,139
just remember me, right?

262
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:03,460
I'm the fucking old guy.

263
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,980
Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop,

264
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,579
put it down, put it down.

265
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:20,420
I wanna go back in there.

266
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,380
Probably like an item.

267
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,739
Watch out.

268
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:30,329
Is there like a saw or an ax or something?

269
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:34,710
You gotta have something in here, right?

270
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,840
Nothing?

271
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:46,230
God damn it.

272
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,110
Take the hand.

273
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:48,030
What do you mean take the hand?

274
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,590
I can't take the fucking hand.

275
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,280
I'm very indecisive, old man, I'm sorry.

276
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:04,809
You can't, you can't, guys, you can't.

277
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,269
All right, where to now?

278
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:21,329
Let's let the game tell us.

279
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:22,170
Monsters in here?

280
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:33,940
Does he have a weapon?

281
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:44,099
I'm all right, I'll be fine.

282
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:45,699
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

283
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,940
Let me help you down.

284
01:03:49,940 --> 01:04:00,329
Was this person just saying that?

285
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:05,340
Put it down.

286
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,820
All right, I just, I activate something.

287
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,659
Ah!

288
01:04:07,659 --> 01:04:13,860
Ah!

289
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:14,699
Ah!

290
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:15,539
Ah!

291
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:16,380
Ah!

292
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,219
Ah!

293
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:18,059
Ah!

294
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:18,900
Oops.

295
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,739
Ah!

296
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,179
He's trying to save me, man.

297
01:04:22,179 --> 01:04:32,519
I'm just trying to save you.

298
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:37,099
I'm surprised that you can actually do that.

299
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:38,460
No, no, don't go back in this room.

300
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,260
I don't need to be in there, no.

301
01:04:42,889 --> 01:04:49,070
I want the old man to go in there first.

302
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,269
No weapons, just go.

303
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:22,630
Okay, what if I don't?

304
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:23,949
Is it safe to go over there?

305
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,559
I can't, okay.

306
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,760
So what do I do now?

307
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,340
There's a key around his neck.

308
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,420
Key's a key.

309
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,460
Reach for the key.

310
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,429
I got the key.

311
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:46,780
Key for unlocking a closed door.

312
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,619
No shit.

313
01:05:55,860 --> 01:06:00,050
All right.

314
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:01,849
All right, I hear another, another person.

315
01:06:04,489 --> 01:06:08,500
Device over here.

316
01:06:09,619 --> 01:06:18,420
What's this do?

317
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,940
Should I go through the hole?

318
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,179
There is a hole right there.

319
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,579
No, can't even go through it.

320
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:45,559
A lot of walking.

321
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:46,400
There's gonna be something in here.

322
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,599
There's gonna be another person in here.

323
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:55,800
Downstairs?

324
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:07,170
This is a giant hallway.

325
01:07:11,289 --> 01:07:17,389
Could be another survivor.

326
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:19,949
Jesus.

327
01:07:20,949 --> 01:07:22,869
I didn't even get to you.

328
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:23,710
I'm dying.

329
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,030
I didn't even get to fucking have it.

330
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,150
One minute with any NPCs.

331
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:34,630
Every single NPC is gone in less than a minute or two.

332
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:51,159
I wanna get close enough to feel the fucking wind on my face.

333
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:57,809
Oh, that's close.

334
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:09,289
The tip of my nose is gone.

335
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:35,810
Really?

336
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:45,979
There's a lot of ways you can die in this game.

337
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:48,180
All right, survival lab, let's go.

338
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:55,590
Oh, do I get to fight the doctor?

339
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,430
I probably am.

340
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:04,659
I get to fight.

341
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,180
This is the worst part about this game.

342
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,220
It's the actual fighting.

343
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,140
Everything else is like kind of cool,

344
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,380
but the fighting is the worst.

345
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:18,979
Pick the flasher, my quarry.

346
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:20,539
A scholar hailing from Ingolstadt.

347
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:24,220
An authority in medicine, science, philosophy,

348
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,619
history, and more besides.

349
01:09:26,619 --> 01:09:29,220
The purportedly brilliant man vanished without warning,

350
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,619
according to my client.

351
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:31,460
How many screens?

352
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,979
I'm curiously attracted to my neighbor,

353
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:34,739
who, while not related to me,

354
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:38,220
feels to her urgent need to have information.

355
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,020
But sympathy serves no purpose to an investigator.

356
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,460
It only clouds judgment.

357
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:46,590
Besides, she played generously in advance.

358
01:09:47,869 --> 01:09:51,210
Investigate yourself in the middle.

359
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:52,050
Can I reach?

360
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:54,449
Turn this way.

361
01:10:05,029 --> 01:10:06,350
What's that?

362
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:13,699
Schloss, schloes, scalpel.

363
01:10:13,699 --> 01:10:16,460
A surgical scalpel to be hurled at enemies.

364
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,460
It's throwing knives?

365
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:32,010
All right, easy.

366
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:37,810
Straight down here.

367
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:38,649
What's the rhyme or reason to this?

368
01:10:38,649 --> 01:10:50,470
Can I just throw them at their heads or something?

369
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:53,380
This is, I love these.

370
01:10:53,380 --> 01:11:01,439
You don't even have to fight anything, it's great.

371
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,310
I just gotta get to the first boss.

372
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:07,229
When I get to the first boss, we'll go to the next one.

373
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:21,710
But I gotta get to the first boss.

374
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,149
Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up.

375
01:11:25,149 --> 01:11:25,989
Put your hands up.

376
01:11:25,989 --> 01:11:27,869
I don't know why you're not putting them up.

377
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:34,619
Who the fuck is she?

378
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:41,300
God damn it.

379
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,180
Okay, download the hatch.

380
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:58,260
Why, I, yeah, it's them, yeah.

381
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,100
First boss is gonna be the doctor.

382
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,380
I'm gonna kill the doctor.

383
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:05,770
Spitter on the right.

384
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:20,739
Who made this game?

385
01:12:22,819 --> 01:12:30,859
What company did this?

386
01:12:30,859 --> 01:12:32,340
You can't ask that question.

387
01:12:38,409 --> 01:12:45,020
One shot, good.

388
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:45,859
Who's next?

389
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,640
There's somebody behind me.

390
01:12:51,640 --> 01:13:03,439
Somebody's in a fucking stall.

391
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:04,279
What?

392
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:05,119
The smell.

393
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:06,920
Go into the, you flush the toilet?

394
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,010
Ugh.

395
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,010
What, pick up?

396
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:12,090
Why'd I put my hands in here?

397
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:12,930
Oh!

398
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,239
I'm glad I tried to look in here

399
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:23,409
because there's no way I would've ever gone over there.

400
01:13:23,409 --> 01:13:26,369
I would have never in a million years ever opened that.

401
01:13:28,289 --> 01:13:29,569
And I would've freaked out,

402
01:13:29,569 --> 01:13:32,489
I would've been like, this game's fucking stupid.

403
01:13:32,489 --> 01:13:34,329
I mean, the game is, this game is fucking,

404
01:13:34,329 --> 01:13:35,289
this game is stupid.

405
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:46,100
But I would've been like even worse than that.

406
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:49,460
It's not bad though.

407
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:53,210
It really isn't.

408
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:57,039
It's not the worst game I've ever played.

409
01:13:57,039 --> 01:13:58,199
I mean, it's up there, the top like,

410
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:00,319
probably top like 50 worst games I've ever played.

411
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:04,310
But it's not the top 10 worst games I've ever played.

412
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:06,029
Being in the top like 50 worst game ever

413
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:07,270
means you're like, probably like a,

414
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:13,189
I don't know, like a five and a half, six.

415
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:14,109
No, that's not even fair.

416
01:14:14,109 --> 01:14:19,300
I wouldn't put this in the top 50 worst games ever.

417
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,260
I'd put this in like the top.

418
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,020
I'm gonna be, oh, all right.

419
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:30,260
I'm gonna be quiet.

420
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:40,680
There's no way I'm gonna get through this.

421
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,000
Oh my God, just die.

422
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,689
Okay.

423
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:47,069
So,

424
01:14:47,069 --> 01:15:04,270
three, two, go cross.

425
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:09,560
Oh my God!

426
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,279
Focus, focus on this, focus!

427
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:18,479
Focus before he spits you!

428
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:20,649
Oh my God.

429
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:21,489
What?

430
01:15:21,489 --> 01:15:22,609
No, go forward.

431
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:29,439
All right, who's next?

432
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,819
Is that it?

433
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:35,109
Okay.

434
01:15:35,109 --> 01:15:37,350
Let's go.

435
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:39,029
Saw, saw, saw, saw.

436
01:15:39,029 --> 01:15:41,909
No, I'm not just gonna get hit by the saw.

437
01:15:41,909 --> 01:15:48,000
All right, I've made it through already.

438
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,680
I can't get killed by every single trap in the whole game.

439
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,239
Okay?

440
01:15:53,239 --> 01:16:11,149
We gotta put our foot down somewhere.

441
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:12,229
Fuck, not good.

442
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:47,739
Just punch him in the chest.

443
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:52,489
All right, go.

444
01:16:52,489 --> 01:16:53,329
Nobody else down here, no?

445
01:16:53,329 --> 01:16:54,170
Good.

446
01:16:54,170 --> 01:17:06,689
Up.

447
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:07,770
Wait, what is that?

448
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:12,899
What's that thing?

449
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:15,619
Is someone trying to get my attention?

450
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:17,859
Is there somebody standing right here?

451
01:17:17,859 --> 01:17:21,390
Did you throw that all the way from down there?

452
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:32,359
Holy shit, man, that's pretty impressive.

453
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:34,439
Get the knife!

454
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:35,439
Get the knife!

455
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:50,350
Shit.

456
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:53,260
Wait, hold on.

457
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,859
Are you going over there to fight the guy

458
01:17:54,859 --> 01:17:55,979
that just spit at you?

459
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:16,579
Kill that one in the middle.

460
01:18:16,579 --> 01:18:22,760
I gotta get rid of that.

461
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:31,600
Where's the knife?

462
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,439
Oh damn it!

463
01:18:32,439 --> 01:18:34,319
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

464
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:35,680
No, what are you doing?

465
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,920
Stop!

466
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,359
What am I doing?

467
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:40,789
I'm not doing this.

468
01:18:40,789 --> 01:18:43,189
I'm not doing this at all.

469
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:44,550
He just helped me get through.

470
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:48,850
Thank you, sir.

471
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:59,140
Open the door, open the door.

472
01:18:59,140 --> 01:18:59,979
Ready to keep?

473
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:06,300
Okay, no, that was me.

474
01:19:09,699 --> 01:19:11,739
Looks like this door needs power.

475
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:14,659
Looks like this door needs power.

476
01:19:14,659 --> 01:19:16,979
I need to turn the power on, of course I do.

477
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:21,779
There's gotta be something in here I can use.

478
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,699
In this little office area.

479
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:28,100
Knife or a board or a plank or a something.

480
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:28,939
A piece of wood.

481
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:32,420
A two by four.

482
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:38,779
Or a, what the hell is in here?

483
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:39,779
Have I been down here?

484
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:52,329
I'm just checking them.

485
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,170
Volatile test tube.

486
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:55,010
They're gonna come alive.

487
01:19:55,010 --> 01:20:02,380
I gotta get something in this room right now.

488
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:07,250
Okay, filled with unstable chemicals.

489
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,090
What's that?

490
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:10,079
Test tube?

491
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,760
Okay, I've got like a explosion or something.

492
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:26,260
Not bad.

493
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,510
What are you saying, what are you saying?

494
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:29,869
Hey, shit.

495
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:32,630
Tape, tape, you don't need to listen to the tape.

496
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:44,210
That's not a problem.

497
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,649
I can turn the power on

498
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:47,569
and then get back up there and open that door

499
01:20:47,569 --> 01:20:54,970
and then throw acid and the doctor's fix it.

500
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:56,220
Hold on.

501
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,659
More test tubes, gimme them.

502
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:02,220
21.

503
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,020
Here's the generator.

504
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,899
So this is where this game's gonna become stupid

505
01:21:05,899 --> 01:21:07,899
because I'm gonna turn the generator on

506
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:09,659
and then 20 enemies are gonna spawn.

507
01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:13,739
Get ready for that.

508
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,619
Okay, power's up and running.

509
01:21:22,619 --> 01:21:24,659
Maybe that door upstairs is open now.

510
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,399
Yeah, of course.

511
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:30,250
Another electrify.

512
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:32,210
I can phase it, I just electrified it.

513
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,300
What's that?

514
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,140
Steroid arms.

515
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:45,100
Stop, stop, stop, stop, gimme that.

516
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,100
I'm gonna wait for them to come down here.

517
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,210
Where is this other one?

518
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,489
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

519
01:21:52,489 --> 01:22:07,500
Don't stand in it.

520
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,619
Oh no.

521
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:14,109
I can't go that way.

522
01:22:14,109 --> 01:22:17,109
No, I want the knife on me.

523
01:22:17,109 --> 01:22:20,229
Stop moving.

524
01:22:21,109 --> 01:22:27,439
Okay, I can't go that way.

525
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:28,760
Break your bones.

526
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,079
Move bones.

527
01:22:30,079 --> 01:23:02,460
Can I fit in here?

528
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:04,260
Can I fucking kill this guy?

529
01:23:05,859 --> 01:23:08,460
There are spikes behind me, by the way.

530
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:11,960
I don't wanna walk forward.

531
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,079
What the fuck?

532
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:48,479
Did he just spill on me?

533
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:53,340
God damn it.

534
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:58,800
I wanna go backwards.

535
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:05,859
There's something on the ground right here on my right.

536
01:24:05,859 --> 01:24:06,699
Ah!

537
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:16,979
Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.

538
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,829
Just scraping my back.

539
01:24:19,829 --> 01:24:21,939
Okay.

540
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,220
What the fuck?

541
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,500
Step forward.

542
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,340
Forward.

543
01:24:33,779 --> 01:24:34,699
I know they're behind me.

544
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:45,850
I'm trying to go forward.

545
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:47,409
Thank God.

546
01:24:47,409 --> 01:24:48,529
I have to kill the first boss.

547
01:24:48,529 --> 01:24:51,010
I refuse to go next until the first boss is dead.

548
01:25:02,539 --> 01:25:03,380
Stop.

549
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,220
Back up.

550
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:09,069
Give me the thing on the ground right here.

551
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:11,979
Where is it?

552
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:12,819
Knife.

553
01:25:12,819 --> 01:25:14,380
Oh my God, game.

554
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:18,859
Whoa.

555
01:25:26,899 --> 01:25:30,060
All right, I want to pick up the thing on the ground.

556
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:31,260
Oh my God.

557
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,500
The millions of dollars that this took to make.

558
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:10,100
Pick it up now.

559
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:10,939
Okay, I'm good.

560
01:26:10,939 --> 01:26:11,779
Let's go.

561
01:26:11,779 --> 01:26:17,520
Enter the hole.

562
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,319
That's a spit guy, spit, spit, spit.

563
01:26:27,739 --> 01:26:29,460
Okay.

564
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,560
Don't bump into that.

565
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:36,600
Don't bump, I'm fucking standing still.

566
01:26:38,659 --> 01:27:00,090
Get me the fuck out of this place.

567
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,569
Seems to be closed off.

568
01:27:03,659 --> 01:27:09,460
Chainsaw.

569
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,180
All right, I'm going to get the chainsaw.

570
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:13,369
Wait, what's that?

571
01:27:13,369 --> 01:27:15,630
What is this thing?

572
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,970
This is the thing on the wall.

573
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:18,810
Can I do that?

574
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:23,340
No.

575
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:29,600
Where's the chainsaw?

576
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,600
What is that?

577
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,880
Bloody chainsaw?

578
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,920
Ooh, wow, you're not lying.

579
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:44,229
I thought that was a gas can.

580
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:56,069
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

581
01:27:56,069 --> 01:28:00,600
I think I heard something.

582
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:11,180
How do I turn it on?

583
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,579
This thing sucks.

584
01:28:13,699 --> 01:28:14,539
This thing sucks.

585
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,020
Get me out of this.

586
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:16,859
Climb up.

587
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:17,699
Up.

588
01:28:17,699 --> 01:28:24,210
Climb.

589
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:25,050
Okay.

590
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:28,939
Then we, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

591
01:28:28,939 --> 01:28:35,180
What do I do?

592
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:49,039
I would love it if you would walk forward.

593
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:50,439
Oh shit.

594
01:28:50,439 --> 01:28:52,000
No.

595
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,439
Okay, I got to be careful.

596
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:12,529
Okay, there's another one right here, right?

597
01:29:12,529 --> 01:29:14,529
This is a, it's a, I knew it.

598
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:17,050
That's why I was waiting.

599
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:19,970
Okay, now this is where we turn it on

600
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:21,729
and we just drag it across the screen

601
01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:23,170
and hit everybody here.

602
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:24,170
Okay?

603
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:25,409
That's what's gonna happen.

604
01:29:25,409 --> 01:29:26,810
All right, are we aware of that?

605
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:27,649
We are?

606
01:29:27,649 --> 01:29:34,170
Good.

607
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:36,819
There's so many people in this room.

608
01:29:36,819 --> 01:29:42,010
How am I supposed to do this?

609
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:53,350
These guys have like electro-zapper things.

610
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:54,390
This guy ain't doing shit over here,

611
01:29:54,390 --> 01:30:02,449
but he's freaking me out.

612
01:30:02,449 --> 01:30:05,319
What?

613
01:30:05,319 --> 01:30:06,159
Where?

614
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:09,220
What happened?

615
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:12,020
I think I have to run for it.

616
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:16,350
Straight for there, right?

617
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:17,470
I can't read what you guys are saying.

618
01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:18,789
You're probably giving me some really good advice right now,

619
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:23,850
but I can't see it.

620
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:27,520
God damn it.

621
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:28,760
They're on like this interval.

622
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,199
I'm gonna have to just walk.

623
01:30:38,989 --> 01:30:46,680
Hey!

624
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,779
Ah!

625
01:30:48,779 --> 01:30:52,039
Ah!

626
01:30:52,039 --> 01:31:00,869
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

627
01:31:00,869 --> 01:31:02,510
All right, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

628
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:09,090
You see?

629
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:09,930
What's he doing?

630
01:31:17,949 --> 01:31:26,090
Ah!

631
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:27,890
Why do I have to be so drunk?

632
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,449
All right, he's gonna kill me.

633
01:31:30,449 --> 01:31:34,229
He's gonna kill me.

634
01:31:34,229 --> 01:31:35,189
He's gonna kill me with that thing.

635
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:54,520
It hurts, it's still, I gotta move.

636
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,680
Oh my God.

637
01:31:55,680 --> 01:32:06,619
Oh my God.

638
01:32:06,619 --> 01:32:09,779
Excuse me, excuse me.

639
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:22,260
Excuse me.

640
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:23,859
Oh, this got in my eye.

641
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:24,699
I'm lying.

642
01:32:30,189 --> 01:32:33,050
Here comes first boss.

643
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:36,060
Fish, am I gonna fish Comet?

644
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,619
The movement's fucked up because of,

645
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:39,319
what are you talking about?

646
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:44,479
Escape with your life.

647
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:46,020
What's that?

648
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:56,020
Vase.

649
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:59,039
Why would I wanna use this as a weapon?

650
01:32:59,039 --> 01:32:59,880
All right, where's the doctor?

651
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:05,539
Let me smash this man's head.

652
01:33:05,539 --> 01:33:06,779
Let me just sneak up behind the doctor

653
01:33:06,939 --> 01:33:08,380
and bash him with this thing.

654
01:33:26,489 --> 01:33:27,649
So those can explode.

655
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:40,960
Sure thing.

656
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:46,060
I'm just gonna walk by him.

657
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:52,199
Just get over there.

658
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:53,199
I'm just walking.

659
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:54,039
I don't even care.

660
01:33:54,039 --> 01:34:07,689
There's no points, you don't level up.

661
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:08,529
Thing.

662
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,380
There's no level up system.

663
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,539
There's no way, who cares?

664
01:34:13,539 --> 01:34:24,090
Just try to get around him.

665
01:34:24,090 --> 01:34:26,409
There are points you do level up.

666
01:34:26,409 --> 01:34:27,329
That's horseshit.

667
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:30,239
No, they aren't.

668
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:31,079
No, there are not.

669
01:34:34,689 --> 01:34:42,939
What's that?

670
01:34:42,939 --> 01:34:48,680
Somebody gonna eat in one of those things.

671
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:56,699
What are you doing?

672
01:34:56,699 --> 01:34:58,619
This game kind of reminds me of

673
01:34:58,619 --> 01:35:01,100
if House of the Dead fell down the stairs.

674
01:35:05,739 --> 01:35:17,939
What is he talking about?

675
01:35:17,939 --> 01:35:18,779
There you go.

676
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:19,699
He's gonna come out in one of these.

677
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:20,659
Oh no, watch out.

678
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:27,260
No, all right.

679
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,579
Well, no trope.

680
01:35:29,579 --> 01:35:40,579
Let's go.

681
01:35:40,579 --> 01:35:41,420
Here we go.

682
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,260
This is it.

683
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:44,819
This is the reason why I've been playing for this long.

684
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:49,300
Sorry.

685
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:51,029
It's you.

686
01:35:51,069 --> 01:35:52,770
Thank God.

687
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:54,439
You're alive.

688
01:35:54,439 --> 01:35:55,760
We've got to get out of here.

689
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,529
Let's get right back in the face.

690
01:35:59,529 --> 01:36:00,369
All right, well, remember,

691
01:36:00,369 --> 01:36:01,369
how long has she been on screen for?

692
01:36:01,369 --> 01:36:04,000
One minute, two minutes?

693
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,239
We are at that threshold

694
01:36:05,239 --> 01:36:20,569
where she's gonna get thrown off the bridge here.

695
01:36:20,569 --> 01:36:22,210
The bad guy's gonna crawl up

696
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:23,770
and just put both of his hands like this

697
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:25,170
and just squirt your head.

698
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:39,159
Here we go.

699
01:36:39,159 --> 01:36:40,399
The piano's gonna fall.

700
01:36:57,739 --> 01:36:59,579
And like a snake.

701
01:36:59,579 --> 01:37:00,420
Yeah.

702
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,420
Right through the chest.

703
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:07,420
Just like.

704
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:22,140
Quiet, don't move.

705
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:23,779
This guy's name isn't Ernest?

706
01:37:28,829 --> 01:37:30,710
His name's fucking Ernest.

707
01:37:33,079 --> 01:37:34,479
That's not scary.

708
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:40,409
That's not scary at all.

709
01:37:40,409 --> 01:37:50,979
Oh, you're not pretty stupid.

710
01:37:50,979 --> 01:37:52,829
Stupid.

711
01:37:52,829 --> 01:38:00,220
Whoa.

712
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:01,060
Uh-oh, hold on.

713
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,260
Be careful.

714
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:04,960
He's gonna turn around.

715
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,449
Quick.

716
01:38:06,449 --> 01:38:10,050
Take the phone.

717
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:25,329
Put your phone on silent.

718
01:38:25,329 --> 01:38:26,170
Really?

719
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:33,739
Can I move?

720
01:38:33,739 --> 01:38:42,319
I guess.

721
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:46,020
Where'd she go?

722
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:59,210
No, go this way.

723
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:00,050
I think you're gonna,

724
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:00,890
you went over here?

725
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:05,659
There you are, okay.

726
01:39:05,659 --> 01:39:06,500
Fucking easy.

727
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:22,539
So what do we do now?

728
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:23,619
Knife?

729
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:30,100
I told you.

730
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:31,180
Hand.

731
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:32,739
I knew it!

732
01:39:32,739 --> 01:39:37,739
Squish!

733
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:39,579
Not even two minutes.

734
01:39:39,619 --> 01:39:41,500
Not even two minutes on screen.

735
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:57,079
Count it.

736
01:39:57,079 --> 01:40:09,340
Give me that.

737
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:11,140
No, let him bite me.

738
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:11,979
Come on.

739
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:14,260
Fucking take it.

740
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:20,189
One more.

741
01:40:20,189 --> 01:40:23,939
All right, all right, all right, I've had enough.

742
01:40:23,939 --> 01:40:27,649
What's in there?

743
01:40:27,649 --> 01:40:33,909
Just a bunch of gross shit.

744
01:40:33,909 --> 01:40:36,710
That corpse is rather suspicious.

745
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:37,909
It sure is.

746
01:40:37,909 --> 01:40:50,409
I should probably kill it now.

747
01:40:50,409 --> 01:40:53,050
Looks like there's something inside.

748
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,810
Am I going, digging around in here?

749
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:56,770
I don't wanna do that.

750
01:40:56,770 --> 01:40:57,609
Oh.

751
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,779
Yeah, well.

752
01:41:03,779 --> 01:41:06,579
I guess it turns out you just had gas.

753
01:41:06,579 --> 01:41:08,760
Huh.

754
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:15,970
Ancient key.

755
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:19,369
Key for unlocking a clip.

756
01:41:19,369 --> 01:41:20,210
Somebody's next to me.

757
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:23,939
Somebody's around here, and I go.

758
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:24,779
Oh shit.

759
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:32,970
Hands not in the air.

760
01:41:32,970 --> 01:41:37,010
This video game just got fucked up.

761
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:41,939
It's a top 50 worst game.

762
01:41:41,939 --> 01:41:57,500
Happened on stream.

763
01:41:57,539 --> 01:42:00,619
I'm gonna have a huge red mark on my head right here.

764
01:42:00,619 --> 01:42:01,699
All right, here we go.

765
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:02,539
Yeah.

766
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:09,289
That corpse is rather suspicious.

767
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:10,569
Get in there, dig in there, get the key.

768
01:42:10,569 --> 01:42:12,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

769
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,420
Looks like there's something inside.

770
01:42:27,609 --> 01:42:31,140
I'm gonna take my hand out.

771
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:32,060
Pick up the key.

772
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:51,380
I'm sure I can probably spot him.

773
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:52,979
I'm not leaving until I do.

774
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:02,029
Ooh, what is that?

775
01:43:02,029 --> 01:43:03,350
A meat hammer.

776
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:04,189
Nice.

777
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:18,359
All right, easy.

778
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:26,220
I don't want that vase.

779
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:27,659
I don't need it.

780
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:32,460
I got an ancient key to the ancient door.

781
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:33,300
No good.

782
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:34,939
Won't budge.

783
01:43:34,939 --> 01:43:42,649
What is it, the valve?

784
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:48,260
Ancient door for the ancient key.

785
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,579
There it is.

786
01:43:50,579 --> 01:43:51,420
Okay.

787
01:43:52,300 --> 01:44:02,340
He's not actually gonna beat this whole game, is he?

788
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:04,460
No, I don't think he will.

789
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:05,579
I mean, sometimes he does that,

790
01:44:05,579 --> 01:44:07,779
but I mean, this is just, I don't think even him,

791
01:44:07,779 --> 01:44:09,779
I don't think he would even wanna do this.

792
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:12,630
It is connect carbonite, though,

793
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:14,869
so I don't be surprised if he does.

794
01:44:14,869 --> 01:44:16,069
Yeah, I guess it's true.

795
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:48,100
I can't get up.

796
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,979
I gotta throw my back up going down that fast.

797
01:44:50,979 --> 01:44:56,329
Ah, ah, oh, I can't.

798
01:44:56,329 --> 01:44:59,409
I gotta go.

799
01:44:59,409 --> 01:45:01,369
I don't have to start on the way back, do I?

800
01:45:01,369 --> 01:45:04,810
Oh, give me a fucking break.

801
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:05,729
Oh, give me a fucking break.

802
01:45:05,729 --> 01:45:06,569
I don't wanna do this again.

803
01:45:06,569 --> 01:45:07,409
I'm about to turn it off.

804
01:45:07,409 --> 01:45:08,329
I am about to.

805
01:45:08,329 --> 01:45:09,170
I'm fighting it.

806
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:11,170
I'm fighting the urge to turn it off.

807
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:12,010
I'm fighting it.

808
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:15,369
That corpse is really suspicious.

809
01:45:16,689 --> 01:45:17,930
Do it, do it, do it.

810
01:45:21,449 --> 01:45:22,569
Oh, I want it so bad.

811
01:45:22,569 --> 01:45:24,289
I button, like, hold on.

812
01:45:24,289 --> 01:45:25,130
I want it so bad.

813
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:26,250
I want it.

814
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:27,369
I want it so bad.

815
01:45:27,369 --> 01:45:29,250
Okay, no, I'm gonna do it.

816
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:30,090
I'm not gonna think about it.

817
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:33,460
I'm just gonna turn it off.

818
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:36,460
Last try, last attempt, this final attempt.

819
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:38,100
No matter what happens, if I lose again,

820
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:39,579
so I'm going on to the other one.

821
01:45:39,579 --> 01:45:53,659
The other one's called punt.

822
01:45:53,659 --> 01:45:56,260
Key, fight the people, walk down the hall,

823
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:57,739
open the door, here we go.

824
01:45:57,739 --> 01:45:59,340
Turn, check it out.

825
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:00,579
Got my hands up already.

826
01:46:08,569 --> 01:46:09,409
Go, let's go.

827
01:46:09,409 --> 01:46:10,250
I'm done, I'm good.

828
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:11,090
I saw.

829
01:46:11,090 --> 01:46:11,930
I want that, no I don't.

830
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:12,770
Just keep this, who cares?

831
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:14,090
Go, it's all the same item.

832
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:15,489
Every item is the same item.

833
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:31,180
Okay, here we go.

834
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:33,920
Same deal.

835
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:34,760
Get the fire poker.

836
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:35,600
I will take that.

837
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:38,399
That's an extra, like, zero percent damage.

838
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:39,640
Go, good, done.

839
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:41,850
Let's go.

840
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:42,689
Duck.

841
01:47:02,569 --> 01:47:03,970
How long can I stay down?

842
01:47:03,970 --> 01:47:08,380
Do I have to duck again?

843
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:10,020
Why am I going this way?

844
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:10,859
What are you doing?

845
01:47:10,859 --> 01:47:11,699
What are you doing?

846
01:47:11,699 --> 01:47:12,779
What are you doing?

847
01:47:12,779 --> 01:47:28,539
Why is the auto thing going the other way?

848
01:47:28,539 --> 01:47:29,619
All right, come on.

849
01:47:29,619 --> 01:47:30,539
No more deaths.

850
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:32,960
I just have to kill the guy.

851
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:37,829
I just have to get rid of the guy

852
01:47:37,829 --> 01:47:39,750
before the audience turns on me.

853
01:47:46,989 --> 01:47:48,430
Did you go through the wall?

854
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:53,300
No, come on, come on.

855
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,100
I wanna finish this.

856
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:56,460
Don't do this.

857
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:58,939
It's just moving on its own now.

858
01:47:58,939 --> 01:48:00,539
Okay, it's time to turn it off.

859
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:11,390
It's time to turn it off.

860
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:12,229
Well, it's not.

861
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:14,350
It's not time to turn it off yet.

862
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:15,189
All right, quick.

863
01:48:15,189 --> 01:48:16,710
Go this way and touch the thing.

864
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:19,289
Did I already do this?

865
01:48:19,289 --> 01:48:20,609
I don't even remember.

866
01:48:20,609 --> 01:48:23,060
Did I turn the valve already?

867
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:25,310
Did I?

868
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:26,149
What do we got?

869
01:48:26,149 --> 01:48:26,989
Yes.

870
01:48:26,989 --> 01:48:27,810
Yes.

871
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:28,649
Did I turn it already?

872
01:48:28,649 --> 01:48:29,750
Yes.

873
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,590
Need to run.

874
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:52,380
Okay, I did.

875
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:56,180
We're done with this.

876
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:59,739
Hey, hey, hey, you fucking idiot, got up.

877
01:48:59,739 --> 01:49:01,180
What are you doing?

878
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:03,119
What?

879
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:16,170
I'm turning.

880
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:23,560
Don't ever buy this.

881
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:24,560
If you go like this,

882
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,159
yeah, you don't have your fucking hands up.

883
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:27,479
Yeah, sometimes it works,

884
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:28,920
but sometimes it just doesn't

885
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,159
if you don't stand there.

886
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,119
Go like this instead.

887
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:35,520
You're like, the other two guys will slash you.

888
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:39,680
Holy shit.

889
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:40,500
Shred it?

890
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:46,119
All right.

891
01:49:46,119 --> 01:49:47,590
Fine.

892
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:51,229
Fine.

893
01:49:51,229 --> 01:50:01,529
Give me this fucking thing.

894
01:50:01,529 --> 01:50:02,369
Let's shred it.

895
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:17,210
Let's shred this fucking thing.

896
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:18,470
What do you say?

897
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:21,869
Let's go.

898
01:50:21,869 --> 01:50:27,100
Piece of shit.

899
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:28,539
Hey, what's this one?

900
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:29,460
Oh, Kung Fu.

901
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:30,300
Remember that game?

902
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:31,180
That was a lot of fun too.

903
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:32,020
Let me get it in there.

904
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:33,020
Fucking dumb thing.

905
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:40,899
Fucking crap.

906
01:50:40,899 --> 01:50:42,500
Oh yeah, remember the Power Rangers game?

907
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:49,189
That game sure was fun, wasn't it?

908
01:50:49,189 --> 01:50:50,029
Fucking piece of crap.

909
01:50:50,029 --> 01:50:51,069
All these games suck.

910
01:50:51,069 --> 01:50:52,149
Fuck the Kinect.

911
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:53,850
What's this one?

912
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:54,810
Stuntman Ignite.

913
01:50:54,810 --> 01:50:55,649
No, that was a good one.

914
01:50:55,649 --> 01:50:58,300
That was a fun game.

915
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:59,140
It's this one.

916
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:00,380
Oh yeah, remember the Petsch game?

917
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:06,100
Fucking dumb ass game.

918
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:09,850
Oh, my tie.

919
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:11,819
It got my tie.

920
01:51:11,819 --> 01:51:14,680
Just like in the fucking Gremlins movie.

921
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,520
Oh shit.

922
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:35,020
Now we're gonna play Haunt.

923
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:38,850
Should be fun.

924
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:43,590
At least I hope it is.

925
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:49,090
And somebody just gave a fucking hundred bucks.

926
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:50,090
Oh no, no, no, Xbox.

927
01:51:50,090 --> 01:51:51,810
No, Xbox, stop.

928
01:51:51,810 --> 01:51:54,140
Xbox, stop it.

929
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,630
Cancel, cancel.

930
01:51:56,630 --> 01:52:02,260
Okay.

931
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:08,689
It was AB Joe just gave a hundred bucks.

932
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:11,260
Thank you so much, AB Joe.

933
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:16,210
They say, hey, Yerma, good to see you up and about again.

934
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:18,289
I got your night sky t-shirt a while back

935
01:52:18,289 --> 01:52:21,850
and I've had six strangers compliment the shirt so far.

936
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:23,840
Feels good, man.

937
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:26,119
You've always been there to help us all through the hard times.

938
01:52:26,119 --> 01:52:28,680
Know that if you ever run into some rough times of your own,

939
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:29,880
know that we're all here for you.

940
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:30,720
Love you, man.

941
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,699
Keep up the good work.

942
01:52:32,699 --> 01:52:33,539
Thanks a lot.

943
01:52:33,539 --> 01:52:35,770
Thank you.

944
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:40,430
Sometimes I feel pretty down too.

945
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:44,020
I'm just like anybody else, right?

946
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:46,500
You got good days, you got bad days.

947
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:47,779
But I really appreciate that.

948
01:52:47,779 --> 01:52:50,590
Thank you.

949
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:55,569
I'm not gonna shred the Kinect.

950
01:52:55,569 --> 01:52:58,020
But seriously though, thank you so much.

951
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:01,460
We also had five community subs from Local Boomer.

952
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:03,880
Thank you, Local Boomer.

953
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:07,960
And then Phylactery gave 50 more fucking dollars.

954
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:10,119
Use this to buy some new legs.

955
01:53:10,119 --> 01:53:12,319
Also, there's a machete and a tape down

956
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:17,460
in that tomb you left.

957
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:19,199
Okay.

958
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:21,819
Thank you.

959
01:53:21,819 --> 01:53:24,260
All right, so this is called Haunt.

960
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:29,319
I'm gonna change the name of the game.

961
01:53:29,319 --> 01:53:38,500
Is this even, I don't think this is even on Twitch.

962
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:41,020
I guess it is.

963
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:42,100
All right.

964
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:45,449
Let's go.

965
01:53:45,449 --> 01:53:46,289
I'm ready.

966
01:53:46,289 --> 01:53:47,130
Wait.

967
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:47,970
I'm not ready.

968
01:53:54,930 --> 01:54:03,880
Haunt.

969
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:05,560
I think this one's a little more lighthearted

970
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:06,399
than the other one.

971
01:54:06,399 --> 01:54:07,239
Is that right?

972
01:54:09,479 --> 01:54:10,319
I don't know.

973
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:15,739
I think this one's supposed to be a better game.

974
01:54:15,739 --> 01:54:17,180
Start game leaderboards helping off

975
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:19,710
with downloadable content.

976
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:24,869
Let's just go.

977
01:54:24,869 --> 01:54:29,260
New game.

978
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:30,899
To ensure that Haunt functions correctly,

979
01:54:30,899 --> 01:54:33,140
please ensure that the Xbox 360 Kinect sensor

980
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:35,300
and microphone are calibrated.

981
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:36,140
Would you like to?

982
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:38,340
No, I've already done this one.

983
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:40,659
I did this like fucking all day.

984
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:46,020
You can use either hand to control your flashlight.

985
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:48,420
If one arm gets tired, just change to the other.

986
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:53,460
So I get a flashlight in one hand.

987
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:54,300
Shred it.

988
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:55,140
I can't shred this one.

989
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:56,699
It's digital download only.

990
01:54:56,699 --> 01:54:58,180
So it cannot be shredded.

991
01:54:59,699 --> 01:55:07,270
As much as I would fucking love to.

992
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:08,270
I like a German.

993
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:11,310
Well, that was a copy pasta that I haven't seen in a while.

994
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:12,310
All right, let's go.

995
01:55:13,579 --> 01:55:18,020
Avatar Award unlocked.

996
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:20,779
Hey, hey, hello down there.

997
01:55:20,779 --> 01:55:23,100
Buddy, hey, hello.

998
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:23,939
Gamer picture?

999
01:55:23,939 --> 01:55:24,979
Are you all right?

1000
01:55:24,979 --> 01:55:25,819
Can you hear me?

1001
01:55:26,699 --> 01:55:27,859
You're not dead, are you?

1002
01:55:27,859 --> 01:55:29,500
Pick up that flashlight if you're not dead.

1003
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:34,260
Just reach out your arm and grab it.

1004
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:39,329
What's a pick up flashlight?

1005
01:55:39,329 --> 01:55:43,140
I guess I got it.

1006
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,100
Oh, wow.

1007
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,060
You're not dead.

1008
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:46,340
That's a nice surprise.

1009
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:49,060
And now you can see where you're going, which is good.

1010
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:52,060
To aim the flashlight,

1011
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:57,149
move your arm just like you're holding a real flashlight.

1012
01:55:57,149 --> 01:55:59,390
Hey, can you test something for me?

1013
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:01,149
There are some suits of armor around you.

1014
01:56:01,149 --> 01:56:02,149
Try turning towards them

1015
01:56:02,149 --> 01:56:03,390
and shining your flashlight at them.

1016
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:05,630
Turn to left or right, look up and look down.

1017
01:56:11,489 --> 01:56:13,890
Okay, stop shining your light on that dirty thing.

1018
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:15,369
Turn around and light up the suit of armor

1019
01:56:15,369 --> 01:56:19,500
on the other side of the corridor, will you?

1020
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:20,420
Test failed.

1021
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:22,619
Luckily, I was testing my maid, not you.

1022
01:56:22,619 --> 01:56:24,659
She's fired and you've passed.

1023
01:56:24,659 --> 01:56:31,869
Now, look at the painting at the end of the corridor.

1024
01:56:31,909 --> 01:56:33,829
Hey, who's that handsome fellow?

1025
01:56:33,829 --> 01:56:35,829
Why, it's me, Benjamin.

1026
01:56:35,829 --> 01:56:36,670
Surprise!

1027
01:56:36,670 --> 01:56:38,310
I mean, if you think Harry Potter is scary,

1028
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:41,029
this could probably be in that same universe.

1029
01:56:41,029 --> 01:56:43,510
As you can see, I am stuck in this painting,

1030
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:46,590
but the good news is I can possess any portrait in the house,

1031
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:49,359
so I've got that going for me.

1032
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:52,399
Still, I wish I could walk around freely like you can.

1033
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:54,680
Hey, wait, you can still walk around, right?

1034
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:56,119
He's doing monkey hats.

1035
01:56:56,119 --> 01:57:02,880
Turn around to the right, will you?

1036
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:03,720
What is it?

1037
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,640
To move in the direction you're facing,

1038
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,119
simply walk on the spot.

1039
01:57:18,689 --> 01:57:19,529
That's so much more intuitive.

1040
01:57:19,529 --> 01:57:21,329
When you get to a corridor junction like this,

1041
01:57:21,329 --> 01:57:23,369
you need to choose which way to go.

1042
01:57:24,329 --> 01:57:27,609
But you still look a little groggy, so I'll choose for you.

1043
01:57:27,609 --> 01:57:30,210
Take the corridor on your left and then head upstairs.

1044
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:31,050
Left.

1045
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:34,979
When you're approaching corridor junction,

1046
01:57:34,979 --> 01:57:36,220
arrows like this will appear

1047
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,060
to show you the available directions.

1048
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:39,659
To choose which way to go

1049
01:57:39,659 --> 01:57:42,979
and your flashlight in the direction you want to take,

1050
01:57:42,979 --> 01:57:45,180
the arrows will change to show the selected direction.

1051
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:47,060
Then just keep walking.

1052
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,619
There's no need to stop while you decide.

1053
01:57:49,619 --> 01:57:51,020
If you'd rather move around freely,

1054
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:52,619
you can turn assisted movement off

1055
01:57:52,619 --> 01:57:54,260
at any time in the settings page.

1056
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:55,300
I ain't gonna do that.

1057
01:57:56,779 --> 01:57:57,619
Absolutely not.

1058
01:57:59,369 --> 01:58:22,939
We're gonna stay on aim assist.

1059
01:58:22,939 --> 01:58:26,189
All right?

1060
01:58:26,189 --> 01:58:27,390
You made it.

1061
01:58:27,390 --> 01:58:29,640
Welcome to my grand hall.

1062
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:30,800
It's pretty grand, right?

1063
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:33,880
I mean, under all the dust and stuff.

1064
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:35,600
Let me take you.

1065
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:37,039
What the fuck are you guys saying?

1066
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:38,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1067
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:39,640
Okay.

1068
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:40,800
I want a little tour.

1069
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,079
I'll move to another painting

1070
01:58:42,079 --> 01:58:43,800
and you try to find me, okay?

1071
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:49,520
Ooh, this is going to be fun.

1072
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:52,119
Try to find the painting that Benjamin moved to.

1073
01:59:00,329 --> 01:59:02,189
This is kids' game?

1074
01:59:02,189 --> 01:59:03,109
I didn't look that up.

1075
01:59:03,109 --> 01:59:04,869
No, this is supposed to be good.

1076
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:19,220
What painting?

1077
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:20,260
I got you right here.

1078
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:22,180
Great.

1079
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:24,739
And now that I have selflessly gotten you back on your feet,

1080
01:59:24,739 --> 01:59:26,699
I ask nothing in return.

1081
01:59:26,699 --> 01:59:29,340
Save for one teensy-weensy favor.

1082
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:30,579
Sounds fair, right?

1083
01:59:30,579 --> 01:59:31,579
Of course it does.

1084
01:59:32,619 --> 01:59:34,500
I'd do it myself if it weren't for this whole

1085
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,899
stuck in a painting thing.

1086
01:59:35,899 --> 01:59:36,739
Said what?

1087
01:59:36,739 --> 01:59:38,100
Why don't you just take your not stuck in a painting

1088
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:40,100
back through this door and we'll get going.

1089
01:59:41,539 --> 01:59:43,699
But I can't interact with the chat room.

1090
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:00,439
All right.

1091
02:00:00,439 --> 02:00:01,279
Am I on my own yet?

1092
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,680
That was a little scary.

1093
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:07,119
I'm gonna go left or right.

1094
02:00:07,119 --> 02:00:07,960
I'll say left.

1095
02:00:11,130 --> 02:00:14,300
Now, you'll need to rummage through various objects

1096
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:16,210
around the mansion.

1097
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,529
See that chest on your left?

1098
02:00:17,529 --> 02:00:19,569
Pop it open and let's see what's in it.

1099
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:21,210
I made the right call.

1100
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:27,260
Okay.

1101
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:36,850
Open it.

1102
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:39,060
There's nothing in there.

1103
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:39,899
Aha!

1104
02:00:39,899 --> 02:00:40,739
Look at that!

1105
02:00:40,739 --> 02:00:41,579
Vitality!

1106
02:00:41,579 --> 02:00:43,739
Sweet, delicious vitality.

1107
02:00:43,739 --> 02:00:46,140
There's vitality in there?

1108
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:48,260
I bet you've never seen that before, have you?

1109
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:51,229
I've got a bunch of it hidden around the place.

1110
02:00:51,229 --> 02:00:53,069
And you're gonna need it.

1111
02:00:53,069 --> 02:00:55,470
Not that this job is dangerous or anything, but-

1112
02:00:55,470 --> 02:00:56,310
Put my hand down.

1113
02:00:56,310 --> 02:00:58,149
If you do lose all your vitality, then well,

1114
02:00:58,149 --> 02:01:00,390
let's just say I can't be held responsible.

1115
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:01,310
Let's keep moving.

1116
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:06,279
Benjamin will often have useful interesting viz- viz-

1117
02:01:06,279 --> 02:01:07,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1118
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:09,319
If you're stuck or, no, I am not, I'm not,

1119
02:01:09,319 --> 02:01:10,159
I'm not a kid.

1120
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:11,960
I'm ready.

1121
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:23,659
Let's go.

1122
02:01:23,659 --> 02:01:24,500
Gosh.

1123
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:38,060
What the fuck are you talking about?

1124
02:01:38,060 --> 02:01:40,300
All right, this is where it gets scary, guys.

1125
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:43,739
Turn the lights down on your house.

1126
02:01:43,739 --> 02:01:55,029
I don't want to listen to Benjamin.

1127
02:01:55,029 --> 02:01:56,050
Fine.

1128
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:57,640
What do you have to say?

1129
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:00,279
This next room has something really great in it.

1130
02:02:00,279 --> 02:02:02,039
Oh, was it something really dangerous?

1131
02:02:02,039 --> 02:02:03,199
I can't remember.

1132
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:04,520
Either way, open the door,

1133
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:08,659
because I'm dying to find out.

1134
02:02:08,659 --> 02:02:10,260
Doors work like any other objects.

1135
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:11,539
Just hold the light on it and-

1136
02:02:11,539 --> 02:02:12,380
No!

1137
02:02:22,739 --> 02:02:23,579
Vitality.

1138
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:41,409
What was that?

1139
02:02:41,409 --> 02:02:42,250
All right.

1140
02:02:42,250 --> 02:02:44,010
I'm gonna get full of vitality here.

1141
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:48,569
Man, I am seeing some monkey-essence right now,

1142
02:02:48,569 --> 02:02:49,810
and I agree with you.

1143
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:52,579
I completely agree.

1144
02:02:54,819 --> 02:03:00,420
Oh!

1145
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:12,119
Oh!

1146
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:13,520
Don't be something in here.

1147
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:14,920
Don't be something in here.

1148
02:03:16,569 --> 02:03:17,770
Oh!

1149
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:18,930
No, it's vitality.

1150
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:28,060
Good.

1151
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:30,409
Was it a slug?

1152
02:03:30,409 --> 02:03:32,409
Extra vitality vial found.

1153
02:03:34,229 --> 02:03:37,300
What does that do?

1154
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:38,739
Vitality vial.

1155
02:03:38,739 --> 02:03:43,369
Hey, you guys, you guys should come here and comment.

1156
02:03:43,369 --> 02:03:44,210
Sorry.

1157
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:45,050
I'm sorry.

1158
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:49,460
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

1159
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:50,460
You right back up again.

1160
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:53,020
Good as new.

1161
02:03:53,020 --> 02:03:55,300
Let's get out of here before more ghosts show up.

1162
02:03:55,300 --> 02:04:00,340
Go through the door to the left of the painting.

1163
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:02,420
All right, go to the door in the left of the painting.

1164
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:05,899
It's time to start playing The Haunted House.

1165
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:22,739
Brats, now where did I put that key?

1166
02:04:28,189 --> 02:04:29,510
Oh, there it is.

1167
02:04:29,510 --> 02:04:31,069
Collect the key and unlock the door.

1168
02:04:31,069 --> 02:04:32,630
What a specific item you needed to proceed.

1169
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:35,149
An icon showing what's required will appear on the screen.

1170
02:04:35,149 --> 02:04:36,590
You need a key.

1171
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:38,229
There it is.

1172
02:04:38,229 --> 02:04:39,430
Sure, I'll get it.

1173
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:40,270
There it is.

1174
02:04:40,270 --> 02:04:41,109
Focus.

1175
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:48,260
Door key got.

1176
02:05:07,289 --> 02:05:08,989
Okay.

1177
02:05:08,989 --> 02:05:22,659
This is where it begins.

1178
02:05:22,659 --> 02:05:42,149
Uh-oh.

1179
02:05:42,189 --> 02:05:43,829
That could be me in some way.

1180
02:05:43,829 --> 02:05:45,430
That's me.

1181
02:05:45,430 --> 02:05:48,229
That's just, I feel like I look like that like every day.

1182
02:05:50,739 --> 02:05:53,100
Ho-ho, we are getting close, my friend.

1183
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:54,899
I've got a feeling that this next room

1184
02:05:54,899 --> 02:05:56,979
has something very exciting in it.

1185
02:05:56,979 --> 02:05:58,739
Something I want very much.

1186
02:05:58,739 --> 02:06:00,739
I mean, something that we want.

1187
02:06:16,890 --> 02:06:18,090
The drawing room.

1188
02:06:18,090 --> 02:06:18,930
Uh-oh.

1189
02:06:21,689 --> 02:06:22,529
I have the boat.

1190
02:06:22,529 --> 02:06:25,329
Ghost, these guys are as mean as they are stupid.

1191
02:06:25,329 --> 02:06:26,170
This is what we just made.

1192
02:06:26,449 --> 02:06:28,489
This is Luigi's mansion.

1193
02:06:30,850 --> 02:06:31,689
Good.

1194
02:06:31,689 --> 02:06:33,149
Now's your chance.

1195
02:06:33,149 --> 02:06:34,939
Hit him with a counter-attack.

1196
02:06:34,939 --> 02:06:35,779
Now what?

1197
02:06:35,779 --> 02:06:36,619
I'm gonna punch him?

1198
02:06:38,619 --> 02:06:41,350
I'm gonna punch the ghost.

1199
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:42,189
Yes, you got him in a daze.

1200
02:06:42,189 --> 02:06:43,829
Now hold your flashlight on him.

1201
02:06:43,829 --> 02:06:45,149
Brutes hate that.

1202
02:06:45,149 --> 02:06:46,270
Keep it steady.

1203
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:50,170
This is like a horror game.

1204
02:06:50,170 --> 02:07:02,420
We only played one horror,

1205
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:04,899
it's only one horror game for the Kinect.

1206
02:07:04,899 --> 02:07:05,739
And we played it.

1207
02:07:05,779 --> 02:07:06,899
He's dazed again.

1208
02:07:06,899 --> 02:07:09,380
Now hold your flashlight on him to finish him off.

1209
02:07:20,979 --> 02:07:23,300
Be done.

1210
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:24,140
Good.

1211
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:25,579
All right, I got him.

1212
02:07:25,579 --> 02:07:29,970
That was so simple.

1213
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:34,960
Open the chest, get the reward.

1214
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:38,170
And that's, I'm kind of regretting

1215
02:07:38,170 --> 02:07:41,649
turning off the other game.

1216
02:07:41,649 --> 02:07:43,250
Not yet, though.

1217
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:44,090
Bingo!

1218
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:46,340
Honest to goodness, Fanta Blast.

1219
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:48,939
I've been looking for one of these forever.

1220
02:07:48,939 --> 02:07:57,670
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1221
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:00,069
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1222
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:03,779
Quick, let's get it back to the grand hall.

1223
02:08:03,779 --> 02:08:06,420
The fastest way, the longer corridor and up the stairs.

1224
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:07,260
Let's get a move on.

1225
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:08,939
Hut, hut, lift those knees.

1226
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:20,890
Oh, let's get in here and see if the game's any good.

1227
02:08:26,489 --> 02:08:32,210
It is fairly intuitive.

1228
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:49,039
Okay, all right, here comes the scary part.

1229
02:08:49,039 --> 02:09:03,029
Whoa, what happened there?

1230
02:09:03,029 --> 02:09:03,949
Almost there.

1231
02:09:03,949 --> 02:09:05,430
Through that door into the grand hall

1232
02:09:05,430 --> 02:09:06,270
and then head down to that door.

1233
02:09:06,270 --> 02:09:07,109
That was very scary.

1234
02:09:07,109 --> 02:09:08,550
This is going to be incredible.

1235
02:09:19,659 --> 02:09:23,579
Quick, go back, go back to Rise of Nightmares.

1236
02:09:26,189 --> 02:09:33,399
Quick!

1237
02:09:33,399 --> 02:09:44,760
Not yet.

1238
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:48,329
What are these doors?

1239
02:09:48,329 --> 02:09:50,789
Vaults?

1240
02:09:50,789 --> 02:09:51,630
I can't read that.

1241
02:09:51,630 --> 02:09:59,239
I can't, I actually cannot read it.

1242
02:09:59,239 --> 02:10:01,930
Oh, have you guys been good, by the way?

1243
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:03,890
Have you been good?

1244
02:10:03,890 --> 02:10:11,520
How good have you been?

1245
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,340
Played in the dark?

1246
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:15,079
Well, it's currently almost 6 p.m. here.

1247
02:10:15,079 --> 02:10:17,560
The sun's not down.

1248
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:20,890
Have you been good?

1249
02:10:20,890 --> 02:10:25,090
I think you've been good.

1250
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:27,300
This game sucks.

1251
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:28,420
Don't say that yet.

1252
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:30,729
We have to get out of the tutorial.

1253
02:10:30,729 --> 02:10:33,470
Hold on though.

1254
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:43,880
If you've been good, I've got something to show you.

1255
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:49,659
So what I'm about to show you guys

1256
02:10:49,659 --> 02:10:55,039
is something really exciting.

1257
02:10:55,039 --> 02:11:01,300
This is a sneak peek at one of the robots for the carnival

1258
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:04,789
coming up in a few weeks.

1259
02:11:04,789 --> 02:11:10,260
So if you do not want to be spoiled,

1260
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:13,380
close your eyes and block your ears.

1261
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:18,140
Or just put me in a fucking tab or something.

1262
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:25,289
So this is the official, official reveal

1263
02:11:25,449 --> 02:11:27,420
of one of the robots.

1264
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:33,920
So why don't we take a look?

1265
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:41,140
Pretty interesting stuff.

1266
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:42,180
World premiere.

1267
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:48,659
This is the robot that will be used for the dunk tank.

1268
02:11:48,659 --> 02:11:54,479
And if you think that looks cool, just wait.

1269
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:55,720
Let's take a look at the side view.

1270
02:11:55,720 --> 02:12:06,699
We've got a good side view.

1271
02:12:06,699 --> 02:12:09,279
There will be more than one robot.

1272
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:11,420
There will be more than two.

1273
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:13,500
There will be more.

1274
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:17,239
This ain't the only one.

1275
02:12:17,239 --> 02:12:18,720
Oh, and if you want to see a full,

1276
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:25,380
kind of wide of how it all works, take a look at this.

1277
02:12:25,380 --> 02:12:31,640
This shit is the real fucking deal, guys.

1278
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:37,119
And yes, the company is Andy Mark.

1279
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:41,819
Awesome group of people.

1280
02:12:41,819 --> 02:12:48,119
Some of you probably already know who this company is.

1281
02:12:48,119 --> 02:13:01,779
Why don't we see how it works?

1282
02:13:01,779 --> 02:13:07,779
You will be in total control of this machine

1283
02:13:07,779 --> 02:13:20,539
in just about three weeks.

1284
02:13:20,539 --> 02:13:23,500
Up, down, left, right.

1285
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:27,140
Oh yeah.

1286
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:28,199
When is this stream?

1287
02:13:28,199 --> 02:13:37,189
It'll be the 21st of September.

1288
02:13:37,189 --> 02:13:40,500
And that ain't nothing.

1289
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:44,300
You ain't seen anything yet.

1290
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:49,659
But huge, huge, huge, huge, huge props to Andy Mark

1291
02:13:51,899 --> 02:13:56,420
because they're just as excited as I am

1292
02:13:56,420 --> 02:14:00,699
as probably a lot of you are now.

1293
02:14:00,699 --> 02:14:05,949
We'll talk way more about them at a later date.

1294
02:14:05,949 --> 02:14:14,560
But I just wanted to tease that.

1295
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:25,979
Hey, let's not go back to being home like this.

1296
02:14:25,979 --> 02:14:27,890
It's gonna be fun.

1297
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:32,069
September 21st, is that correct?

1298
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:33,479
No, like this?

1299
02:14:33,479 --> 02:14:37,279
Cause it's mirrored.

1300
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:41,220
No, now this game is like lame in comparison.

1301
02:14:41,220 --> 02:14:42,670
I want to do that well.

1302
02:14:42,670 --> 02:14:47,500
We're at like peak time.

1303
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:48,819
But I'm so fucking excited.

1304
02:14:48,819 --> 02:14:50,899
You have no idea.

1305
02:14:50,899 --> 02:14:52,340
It's been a few months

1306
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:54,960
of trying to get this all put together.

1307
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:58,350
Lots of people involved.

1308
02:14:58,350 --> 02:15:00,989
It's gonna be fucking awesome.

1309
02:15:00,989 --> 02:15:03,729
Save the date.

1310
02:15:03,729 --> 02:15:14,020
All right, let's play the kids' game.

1311
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:17,699
What's it doing?

1312
02:15:17,699 --> 02:15:20,569
Oh, I gotta find the ectoplasm, right?

1313
02:15:20,569 --> 02:15:24,090
Hurry, get the final phytoflask back to where it belongs.

1314
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:27,899
Take it to the statue before...

1315
02:15:27,899 --> 02:15:33,260
These guys, anyone but these guys.

1316
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:34,619
I'll stature you little creeps.

1317
02:15:34,619 --> 02:15:37,500
It's Beatback Sonic, except he's orange.

1318
02:15:37,539 --> 02:15:39,380
It's Garfield, Beanbag Sonic.

1319
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:47,369
This slimy ghost fingers off my phytoflask.

1320
02:15:47,369 --> 02:15:48,210
Good day.

1321
02:15:48,210 --> 02:15:50,289
I'm so, so close.

1322
02:15:50,289 --> 02:15:52,409
Years of work wasted.

1323
02:15:52,409 --> 02:15:55,180
Now I'm back to square one.

1324
02:15:55,180 --> 02:15:58,260
Still, they haven't beaten me yet.

1325
02:15:58,260 --> 02:16:00,619
I have one of the four phytoflasks.

1326
02:16:00,619 --> 02:16:01,939
But of course, I still have one, right?

1327
02:16:01,939 --> 02:16:02,779
It really isn't.

1328
02:16:02,779 --> 02:16:03,979
It is just Luigi's mansion.

1329
02:16:03,979 --> 02:16:05,380
Now, first things first.

1330
02:16:05,380 --> 02:16:07,060
Let's get that phytoflask back to the statue.

1331
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:07,899
It's all right.

1332
02:16:07,899 --> 02:16:08,720
It's fun.

1333
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:11,079
It is.

1334
02:16:11,079 --> 02:16:12,260
Don't make me put in another one.

1335
02:16:12,260 --> 02:16:14,899
I'll put in Guy Fieri's minute to win it

1336
02:16:14,899 --> 02:16:16,500
if you don't fucking calm down.

1337
02:16:23,859 --> 02:16:25,689
See that coming?

1338
02:16:25,689 --> 02:16:41,909
To protect my last phytoflask.

1339
02:16:41,909 --> 02:17:04,430
I've got him.

1340
02:17:04,430 --> 02:17:05,909
Nice work.

1341
02:17:05,909 --> 02:17:06,750
Where's Dr. Regat?

1342
02:17:06,750 --> 02:17:08,030
You should talk that ghost a thing or two.

1343
02:17:08,030 --> 02:17:08,870
Oh, there he is.

1344
02:17:08,870 --> 02:17:09,709
Now let's get that phytoflask.

1345
02:17:09,709 --> 02:17:10,549
Get that phytoflask.

1346
02:17:10,549 --> 02:17:11,389
Get that phytoflask.

1347
02:17:11,389 --> 02:17:12,229
Get that phytoflask.

1348
02:17:12,229 --> 02:17:13,069
Get that phytoflask.

1349
02:17:13,069 --> 02:17:14,600
Get that phytoflask.

1350
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:15,440
Yeah, thanks.

1351
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:24,040
I appreciate the encouragement.

1352
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:28,219
To the statue where it belongs.

1353
02:17:28,219 --> 02:17:29,059
I have to move.

1354
02:17:29,059 --> 02:17:42,379
I can't, I'm like turning to stone.

1355
02:17:42,379 --> 02:17:44,579
I just slammed that phytoflask down into the slot

1356
02:17:44,579 --> 02:17:52,319
and we're good to go.

1357
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:56,139
Do I have to get three more of these to win?

1358
02:17:56,139 --> 02:17:56,979
Should I do it?

1359
02:18:02,579 --> 02:18:04,940
Well, we've got one phytoflask safe.

1360
02:18:04,940 --> 02:18:06,299
Now if we could just get the other three,

1361
02:18:06,299 --> 02:18:08,719
we've still got a chance.

1362
02:18:08,719 --> 02:18:11,120
Luckily, those stupid ghosts can't leave the boundaries

1363
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:12,920
of my glaring designed mansion.

1364
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,860
So tracking them down should be easy.

1365
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:16,159
If we work together.

1366
02:18:17,159 --> 02:18:19,399
I think they went through those doors up on the balcony.

1367
02:18:19,399 --> 02:18:22,239
They all lead to different parts of my mansion.

1368
02:18:22,239 --> 02:18:23,239
We'll need to search them all,

1369
02:18:23,239 --> 02:18:25,680
but I'll let you pick which one we go through first.

1370
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:28,120
Collaboration is the key to any successful partnership.

1371
02:18:29,079 --> 02:18:34,229
Now, get up those stairs and choose a door.

1372
02:18:34,229 --> 02:18:35,309
All right, this is where I get to choose a door.

1373
02:18:35,309 --> 02:18:37,430
This is where I'm gonna, this is important.

1374
02:18:39,370 --> 02:18:54,020
Check this shit out.

1375
02:18:54,020 --> 02:18:58,319
There is some exhilarating fucking gameplay.

1376
02:18:58,319 --> 02:19:02,110
All right, one, two, or three.

1377
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:03,309
This one's got the solar system on it.

1378
02:19:03,309 --> 02:19:05,309
That's what I'm going to.

1379
02:19:05,309 --> 02:19:06,829
If I'm not wowed in 10 seconds,

1380
02:19:06,829 --> 02:19:15,379
I'm gonna put in Guy Fiori.

1381
02:19:15,379 --> 02:19:16,700
I talked a lot of shit.

1382
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:59,969
Oh, they lit up the hallway.

1383
02:19:59,969 --> 02:20:08,889
It's, behold, my beautiful lubinarium.

1384
02:20:08,889 --> 02:20:12,090
Well, at least try to imagine my beautiful lubinarium

1385
02:20:12,090 --> 02:20:13,610
and what it would look like if.

1386
02:20:19,780 --> 02:20:22,500
Okay, usually it's chat that gets bored

1387
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:25,899
and they're like doing Jupiters and talking to each other,

1388
02:20:25,899 --> 02:20:27,059
but I'm bored right now.

1389
02:20:27,059 --> 02:20:28,579
Like that's pretty rare.

1390
02:20:28,579 --> 02:20:30,500
That's pretty rare for the streamer to be bored.

1391
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:32,409
It is.

1392
02:20:32,409 --> 02:20:34,770
I don't typically get bored of a game.

1393
02:20:34,770 --> 02:20:36,450
Like I'm bored.

1394
02:20:36,450 --> 02:20:37,290
I am.

1395
02:20:37,290 --> 02:20:39,770
All right, we're gonna go, we're gonna go straight.

1396
02:20:48,090 --> 02:20:49,829
All right, what's down this hall?

1397
02:20:49,829 --> 02:20:55,260
Anything in particular?

1398
02:20:55,260 --> 02:20:59,360
How about in here?

1399
02:20:59,360 --> 02:21:00,200
Open.

1400
02:21:03,239 --> 02:21:06,290
Okay.

1401
02:21:06,290 --> 02:21:07,129
Oh no.

1402
02:21:08,459 --> 02:21:13,069
Not another one of these.

1403
02:21:13,069 --> 02:21:13,909
Punch.

1404
02:21:33,739 --> 02:21:34,819
Why does it go twice?

1405
02:21:39,139 --> 02:21:41,100
If you had a son or a daughter,

1406
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:46,479
that this would be fun, right?

1407
02:21:46,479 --> 02:21:56,360
What was that?

1408
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:57,639
What's in there?

1409
02:21:57,639 --> 02:21:58,920
Something scary.

1410
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:01,000
I hope it's not something scary.

1411
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:01,879
I need slides.

1412
02:22:01,879 --> 02:22:02,959
All right, all right.

1413
02:22:27,319 --> 02:22:28,159
What's that?

1414
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:30,260
The telephone?

1415
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:31,299
Let's split the switch.

1416
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:41,569
Nothing.

1417
02:22:41,569 --> 02:22:48,450
I'm gonna go in that door to the left.

1418
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:51,450
Open it.

1419
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:54,079
I can't open this fucking door.

1420
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:57,709
Why not?

1421
02:22:57,709 --> 02:23:03,700
Where are these slides?

1422
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:21,840
Okay.

1423
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:28,290
What was that?

1424
02:23:28,290 --> 02:23:29,329
All right, we're gonna go right

1425
02:23:29,329 --> 02:23:30,930
because that's where I haven't been.

1426
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:31,770
No, no, no.

1427
02:23:31,770 --> 02:23:33,729
Dumb game is dumb.

1428
02:23:33,729 --> 02:23:34,889
Dumb game.

1429
02:23:34,889 --> 02:23:35,930
Turn.

1430
02:23:35,930 --> 02:23:42,000
I wanna go this way.

1431
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,559
That was pretty intense.

1432
02:23:44,559 --> 02:23:50,700
I'm gonna go right.

1433
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:55,930
What was that?

1434
02:23:55,930 --> 02:23:56,770
Try this door.

1435
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:03,739
Okay, easy.

1436
02:24:03,739 --> 02:24:06,750
This is the lunch room.

1437
02:24:06,750 --> 02:24:12,120
Let's examine some stuff.

1438
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:15,670
I got full health.

1439
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:25,309
Check each one of these.

1440
02:24:25,309 --> 02:24:27,139
What about that?

1441
02:24:27,139 --> 02:24:34,840
What's that sound?

1442
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:36,280
Projector slide found.

1443
02:24:37,780 --> 02:24:38,620
Oh!

1444
02:24:49,059 --> 02:24:50,260
It doesn't even come up on camera.

1445
02:24:50,260 --> 02:24:51,620
I don't come fucking at it.

1446
02:24:58,360 --> 02:25:00,670
Poured water all over my eyes.

1447
02:25:00,670 --> 02:25:01,989
Let's try, wait, just try that again.

1448
02:25:01,989 --> 02:25:11,000
Ready?

1449
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:15,389
It's fucking terrifying.

1450
02:25:15,389 --> 02:25:17,309
I don't recommend playing this game

1451
02:25:17,309 --> 02:25:35,120
because it's really fucking scary.

1452
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:37,840
Am I actually about to type in the Guy Fieri?

1453
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:43,069
Then there's no way no one's ever played this.

1454
02:25:43,069 --> 02:25:50,120
No one has played Guy Fieri.

1455
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:51,690
Guy?

1456
02:25:51,690 --> 02:25:52,530
How do you spell Guy?

1457
02:25:52,530 --> 02:26:01,620
Oh, it's right here.

1458
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:03,709
I'm wearing a hat.

1459
02:26:03,709 --> 02:26:06,969
This is a baseball hat.

1460
02:26:06,969 --> 02:26:11,010
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

1461
02:26:11,010 --> 02:26:21,079
This is a baseball hat.

1462
02:26:21,079 --> 02:26:28,600
No, I gotta wear it like this.

1463
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:32,879
Why is it warped?

1464
02:26:32,879 --> 02:26:36,229
All right, there is no Guy Fieri.

1465
02:26:36,229 --> 02:26:37,909
I'm gonna have to just make it games and demos.

1466
02:26:37,909 --> 02:26:43,229
Guy Fieri doesn't fucking exist.

1467
02:26:44,069 --> 02:26:44,909
I don't even know how to play Minute to Win It.

1468
02:26:44,909 --> 02:27:00,950
How do you play?

1469
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:05,129
In a minute, you have to win it.

1470
02:27:05,129 --> 02:27:21,379
Right.

1471
02:27:21,379 --> 02:27:27,319
I guess that makes sense.

1472
02:27:27,319 --> 02:27:32,079
This is not even on right.

1473
02:27:32,079 --> 02:27:34,879
All right, Guy Fieri, let's see what you got.

1474
02:27:34,879 --> 02:27:57,950
This might be the scariest fucking game all night.

1475
02:27:57,950 --> 02:27:59,790
I hope he's on camera.

1476
02:27:59,790 --> 02:28:04,719
Please be on camera.

1477
02:28:04,719 --> 02:28:07,389
Is this him singing?

1478
02:28:07,389 --> 02:28:12,069
Could be.

1479
02:28:12,069 --> 02:28:14,629
No, no, no, I don't care.

1480
02:28:15,889 --> 02:28:16,969
Fuck your error code.

1481
02:28:19,829 --> 02:28:30,209
There it is.

1482
02:28:30,209 --> 02:28:31,409
Just me.

1483
02:28:31,409 --> 02:28:41,159
It's just me.

1484
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:43,799
All right, I don't know how to play Minute to Win It.

1485
02:28:43,799 --> 02:28:45,399
I've never seen this show.

1486
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:55,750
Show one.

1487
02:28:55,750 --> 02:28:57,309
No, I don't know how to play Minute to Win It.

1488
02:28:57,309 --> 02:29:02,229
Let me just try easy.

1489
02:29:02,229 --> 02:29:08,229
I wonder the lyrics to this song.

1490
02:29:08,229 --> 02:29:09,069
Hold on.

1491
02:29:09,069 --> 02:29:14,639
No, I wanna hear the lyrics.

1492
02:29:14,639 --> 02:29:16,540
Let's go.

1493
02:29:16,540 --> 02:29:18,219
Everybody out on the floor.

1494
02:29:18,219 --> 02:29:19,940
Get up, get up.

1495
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:21,340
Get up, get up.

1496
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:24,040
Now, let's move.

1497
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:25,920
Can you show me what you're gonna do?

1498
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:27,200
Get up, get up.

1499
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:34,530
Because the party don't stop.

1500
02:29:34,809 --> 02:29:43,520
I would rather just you have not have a theme song.

1501
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:45,319
The party does stop.

1502
02:29:45,319 --> 02:29:49,000
The party does stop at 2 a.m. in most fucking cities.

1503
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,159
That's when it's over.

1504
02:29:50,159 --> 02:29:51,280
That's when you have to go home.

1505
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:53,760
Don't listen to this bullshit.

1506
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,159
No, because the party don't stop.

1507
02:29:56,159 --> 02:29:57,079
Yes, it does.

1508
02:29:57,079 --> 02:30:00,420
You have to go home and go to bed at like 2.30.

1509
02:30:00,420 --> 02:30:05,399
What are we doing?

1510
02:30:05,399 --> 02:30:08,760
Guy Fieri, come on.

1511
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:15,690
Fieri, and this is Minute to Win It.

1512
02:30:15,690 --> 02:30:21,909
This is these mind blowing games using household items.

1513
02:30:21,909 --> 02:30:22,750
Whoa.

1514
02:30:23,549 --> 02:30:25,309
It's a million people here.

1515
02:30:25,309 --> 02:30:26,750
Now, let's see if our next contestant

1516
02:30:26,750 --> 02:30:31,840
has the luck and skill to win a million.

1517
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:35,030
Contestant.

1518
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:40,360
Catch me.

1519
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:42,200
What are they spraying on the audience?

1520
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:43,879
60 seconds each.

1521
02:30:43,879 --> 02:30:51,319
Knock them all out and you'll walk away with be so easy.

1522
02:30:51,319 --> 02:30:53,360
So, we've given you three lives.

1523
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:55,200
Challenge, you lose a life.

1524
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:57,600
Lose all three and your game's over.

1525
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:00,280
The bigger the money, the harder the challenge.

1526
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:02,569
Remember, three banking levels.

1527
02:31:02,569 --> 02:31:04,049
Complete level one, you'll make a thousand bucks.

1528
02:31:04,049 --> 02:31:05,569
Baking levels?

1529
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:17,530
Can you guys quiet down back there?

1530
02:31:17,530 --> 02:31:23,149
Let's take a look at your level one blueprint.

1531
02:31:23,149 --> 02:31:27,600
I don't have play.

1532
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:28,440
We're dialing in.

1533
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:30,200
Nervous Nellie.

1534
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:31,200
Nervous Nellie.

1535
02:31:34,229 --> 02:31:36,950
The standard pedometer is engineered to count footsteps

1536
02:31:36,950 --> 02:31:38,430
while walking or running.

1537
02:31:38,430 --> 02:31:40,430
In this challenge, the contestant must strap

1538
02:31:40,430 --> 02:31:43,350
four of these counting devices to their arms and legs

1539
02:31:43,350 --> 02:31:44,870
and then let loose.

1540
02:31:44,870 --> 02:31:47,309
The player must accumulate the required number of clicks

1541
02:31:47,309 --> 02:31:48,629
in the time allotted.

1542
02:31:48,629 --> 02:31:49,709
Number of clicks?

1543
02:31:49,709 --> 02:31:51,229
Trigger your arm pedometers

1544
02:31:51,229 --> 02:31:53,469
by moving the correct arm.

1545
02:31:53,469 --> 02:31:54,309
Does this happen on the show?

1546
02:31:54,309 --> 02:31:57,350
Simply move your legs to activate the correct pedometers.

1547
02:31:58,889 --> 02:32:01,250
Failure to complete this task in 60 seconds

1548
02:32:01,250 --> 02:32:03,450
may result in elimination.

1549
02:32:03,450 --> 02:32:06,329
Okay, so I'm doing the amount of clicks.

1550
02:32:14,440 --> 02:32:15,280
The challenge.

1551
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:18,040
You've got a minute to win.

1552
02:32:18,040 --> 02:32:20,079
Here we go.

1553
02:32:20,079 --> 02:32:21,479
A thousand dollars at stake.

1554
02:32:21,479 --> 02:32:27,040
The game begins in three, two, one.

1555
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:49,879
Ha ha.

1556
02:32:49,879 --> 02:32:58,770
Maybe three seconds left.

1557
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:31,840
Failed.

1558
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:37,479
You have two lives remaining.

1559
02:33:37,479 --> 02:33:40,639
Win the challenge.

1560
02:33:40,639 --> 02:33:47,239
That was fucking impossible.

1561
02:33:47,239 --> 02:33:52,780
How the fuck can somebody do that?

1562
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:53,620
Total clicks.

1563
02:33:53,620 --> 02:33:55,100
How many clicks in my left leg?

1564
02:33:55,100 --> 02:34:02,959
Five?

1565
02:34:02,959 --> 02:34:07,350
Why does this taste like blood?

1566
02:34:07,350 --> 02:34:08,190

Are you ready?

1568
02:34:09,030 --> 02:34:10,950

1569
02:34:10,950 --> 02:34:12,790
Good fuck.

1570
02:34:12,790 --> 02:34:15,639
All right, I gotta have a new strategy here.

1571
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:21,219
The game begins in three, two, one.

1572
02:34:21,219 --> 02:34:29,309
The game begins in three, two, one.

1573
02:34:34,190 --> 02:34:35,270

30 seconds left.

1575
02:35:00,950 --> 02:35:01,790

1576
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:24,190

1577
02:35:24,190 --> 02:35:25,030
Failed.

1578

You have one life.

1579
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:31,840
I'm sure you can beat this challenge.

1580
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:50,739
It's not easy.

1581
02:35:50,739 --> 02:35:52,579
It's do or die on this one.

1582
02:35:52,579 --> 02:35:54,340
So now you know what to do.

1583
02:35:54,340 --> 02:35:56,459
You've got a minute to win it.

1584
02:35:56,459 --> 02:35:57,299
Shake your elbow.

1585
02:35:57,299 --> 02:35:58,860
That's what I was doing.

1586
02:35:58,860 --> 02:36:01,180
What about the leg?

1587
02:36:01,180 --> 02:36:06,799
The game begins in three, two, one.

1588
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:38,440

02:37:15,649 --> 02:37:18,250
That wasn't easy, but you finished the challenge.

1593
02:37:18,250 --> 02:37:23,750
Look at the money.

1594
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:29,659
Oh, I got a long way to go, guy.

1595
02:37:29,659 --> 02:37:33,399
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1596
02:37:33,399 --> 02:37:46,569
I'm gonna throw up.

1597
02:37:46,569 --> 02:37:48,770

That's what it is.

1600
02:37:52,420 --> 02:37:54,059
Do you want to stay and play,

1601
02:37:54,059 --> 02:37:55,459
or do you wanna take the cash?

1602
02:37:55,459 --> 02:37:56,540
Guys, and no.

1603
02:37:57,700 --> 02:38:01,600
No, there's not somebody mowing the lawn out here.

1604
02:38:01,639 --> 02:38:16,079
There are no lawns. This is Las Vegas. I'm gonna stay

1605
02:38:25,399 --> 02:38:37,040
Go the distance

1606
02:38:39,159 --> 02:38:45,260
In this challenge a measuring tape will be used as a bridge to roll ping-pong balls into shot glasses

1607
02:38:45,700 --> 02:38:50,399
The contestant must deposit balls into the shot glasses at varying distances

1608

1610
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:10,360
Failure to complete this task in 60 seconds may result in elimination

1611
02:39:11,559 --> 02:39:13,559
Do I get three more lives?

1612
02:39:13,719 --> 02:39:17,690
Did I use them all?

1613
02:39:19,290 --> 02:39:24,569
You complete the next challenge or you want life so now you got the low down on the showdown

1614
02:39:24,809 --> 02:39:29,790

I like this tattoo. It's gonna get a brown sweat ring in a circle here and I don't like that

1620
02:41:21,049 --> 02:41:23,049
I hate having hats like that

1621
02:41:23,450 --> 02:41:25,450
I don't know what i'm gonna do about it

1622
02:41:27,229 --> 02:41:29,229
extreme hanky panky

1623
02:41:30,750 --> 02:41:37,549
What began with a single box of 160 tissues has now evolved into a tissue typhoon in a test of dexterity

1624
02:41:37,629 --> 02:41:43,149
The contestant must empty two standard tissue boxes alternating between both the left and the right hand

1640
02:44:19,690 --> 02:44:20,889

02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:26,520
make 15 squats

1643
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:28,840

1644
02:44:29,790 --> 02:44:32,510

1645
02:44:34,170 --> 02:44:36,170

1648
02:44:46,860 --> 02:44:54,379
Like me only from m power the m power mpl is made of a revolutionary new material that lets you lift weight without

1651
02:45:22,829 --> 02:45:24,829
Is your level four

They just used me that was that was just free fucking work there

1653
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:38,280
How's it hanging?

1654
02:45:38,280 --> 02:45:42,200
In this challenge the contestant must hang a banana from a string attached to their waist

1655
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:49,399
Using the momentum generated by their hips the player must swing a banana to knock several oranges across the floor and into the hoop

1656
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:52,520
They just knew like what were they thinking?

1657
02:45:53,239 --> 02:45:59,479
To move walk or run in place feel like this thrust your hips forward to swing the banana and hit the orange

1658
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:04,200
Failure to complete this task in 60 seconds may result in elimination

1659
02:46:05,079 --> 02:46:07,079

1660

This is your last life now you can do it. You've got a minute to win it go get it

1661
02:46:19,229 --> 02:46:22,909

02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:48,940
Try p no, I can't pick it on the game show

1667
02:47:49,500 --> 02:47:56,590
The choice to take the money and run or stay and have some fun

1668
02:47:59,319 --> 02:48:01,319
10 000 is not enough

1669
02:48:04,090 --> 02:48:06,520
Is your level blueprint

1670
02:48:07,770 --> 02:48:09,610
Actually, I can still hear it

1671
02:48:09,610 --> 02:48:12,510
I have my bluetooth headphones on I can still hear what the I can hear the explanation

1672
02:48:19,979 --> 02:48:26,459
A ping pong ball weighs one tenth of an ounce and has a diameter of approximately 1.5 inches in this challenge

1673
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:31,739
The contestant must bounce the ball from the floor to the wall and catch it in a bucket attached to their head

1674
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:36,860
Hold either hand out to the side to grab a ball

1675
02:48:38,059 --> 02:48:40,459
Perform an overhand throwing motion to throw

1676
02:48:41,579 --> 02:48:45,020
Move left or right by stepping in that direction

1677
02:48:46,379 --> 02:48:49,260
Move left right forward or back to catch a ball

1678
02:48:50,889 --> 02:48:54,989
Failure to complete this task in 60 seconds may result in elimination

1679
02:48:54,989 --> 02:49:15,409

lead right and

1683
02:50:27,709 --> 02:50:31,120
Forward with the ball. I think I have an idea

1684
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:39,840
Overhead throw step you gotta catch it, right?

1685
02:50:40,559 --> 02:50:55,700
All right. I got it. What's going on here?

1686
02:51:22,049 --> 02:51:24,049
You motherfucker, really?

1687
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:32,690
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

1688
02:51:32,770 --> 02:51:42,370

I want to do minutes to win it again

1692
02:52:23,100 --> 02:52:35,969
No, that one sucks that one. All these games are so bad

1693
02:52:36,770 --> 02:52:39,889
I don't even want to play these ones because I know how shitty they're gonna be

1694
02:52:41,469 --> 02:52:44,989
You know when you just know I don't even need to put this in. I know it's gonna suck

1695
02:52:46,819 --> 02:52:48,819
I don't even need to play it

1696
02:52:55,780 --> 02:52:57,780
Where is my fucking thing that I want?

1697
02:53:03,469 --> 02:53:13,340
Zoo is my connect just broken might have to shred my fucking connect

1698

1699
02:53:38,590 --> 02:53:48,260
Just me i'm ready. Let's make it fucking hard

1700
02:53:53,469 --> 02:54:12,159

Play

1702
02:54:28,829 --> 02:54:30,750
Nervous nelly

1703
02:54:30,750 --> 02:54:32,670
Ah, it's this one

1704
02:54:32,670 --> 02:54:39,860
The standard pedometer is engineered to count footsteps while walking or running in this challenge

1705
02:54:41,299 --> 02:54:46,420
Four of these counting devices to their arms and legs and then I know how to play I know how to play

1706
02:54:46,739 --> 02:54:49,239
The required number of clicks in the time allotted

1707
02:54:54,819 --> 02:54:57,219
Similarly move your legs to activate the correct

1708
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:01,979
This is it

1709
02:55:01,979 --> 02:55:07,790
You got it. You've got a minute to win it. Good luck. How many do I have to do on hard?

1710
02:55:08,909 --> 02:55:11,389
I'll make sure my fucking my wig doesn't come off

1711
02:55:12,889 --> 02:55:14,909
350 no way

1712
02:55:23,700 --> 02:55:42,690
I'm pulling a muscle

1713
02:56:06,479 --> 02:56:12,940
Oh

1714
02:56:31,809 --> 02:56:35,260
Let's hit the music again

1715
02:56:37,100 --> 02:56:41,969
I can't do that. Well, when did this not gonna happen?

1716
02:56:44,930 --> 02:56:46,930
That's what I imagine like all these fucking

1717
02:56:47,409 --> 02:56:51,569
All these like pop stars that you see dancing around singing at a concert

1718
02:56:52,209 --> 02:56:55,889
Yeah, that's what I get sound like that's why the lipstick comes in play

1719
02:56:56,850 --> 02:56:59,489
Let's go party on the floor

1720
02:57:00,979 --> 02:57:02,979
Get up get up

1721
02:57:03,379 --> 02:57:05,620
No way

1722
02:57:05,620 --> 02:57:06,979
I'm not leaving

1723
02:57:06,979 --> 02:57:13,309
Can you imagine like some of these fucking moves that they do?

1724
02:57:14,030 --> 02:57:16,350
Just this move right here. Oh, that's all I have to ask

1725
02:57:18,379 --> 02:57:19,809
this one

1726
02:57:19,809 --> 02:57:22,690
Imagine singing a song. Let's say the lyrics are

1727
02:57:23,649 --> 02:57:26,370
And we're gonna go for it, right?

1728
02:57:27,010 --> 02:57:30,030
Imagine doing this fucking smashing your head that way

1729
02:57:30,430 --> 02:57:33,709
Like and we're back. No, no, no, it's gonna be like

1730
02:57:34,430 --> 02:57:40,030
And we're gonna go for it deposit balls into the shot glasses at varying distances

1731
02:57:42,639 --> 02:57:46,739
You're being lied to

1732
02:57:49,299 --> 02:57:51,139
Into the glass

1733
02:57:51,139 --> 02:57:54,500
The speed of the next ball will automatically increase after a successful roll

1734
02:57:55,870 --> 02:58:00,590
Failure to complete this task in 60 seconds may result in elimination. I'm fine

1735
02:58:00,829 --> 02:58:20,719
Now the challenge you get a minute to win it the game begins in

1736
02:58:22,049 --> 02:58:24,610
18 shit, okay. I got to be actually careful there

1737
02:58:26,290 --> 02:58:38,059
I'm going to go down you fucking dumb

1738
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:44,219
Don't worry, I know you can win this challenge grind up all the connect and turn him into fucking shoes

1739
02:59:45,180 --> 03:00:01,280
So now you got the load on the showdown. You've got a minute to win it go get it. He's tilted

1740
03:00:02,559 --> 03:00:04,559
Well, yeah, like come on

1741
03:00:05,920 --> 03:00:07,920
I would be I am

1742
03:00:23,180 --> 03:00:30,049
This is like as far as I can fucking do this the dumbass steering wheel

1743
03:01:12,860 --> 03:01:17,600
Level complete $500

1744
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:22,959
Great job, you beat the challenge. Let's check out your money

1745
03:01:36,319 --> 03:01:42,420
The question is do you want to stay and play or walk away stay

1746
03:01:43,620 --> 03:01:45,620
This is on hard mode

1747
03:01:54,299 --> 03:01:56,299
See resident sleeper right there

1748
03:01:58,860 --> 03:02:00,860
Extreme hanging sleeping anymore

1749
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:09,180
What began with a single box of 160 tissues has now evolved into a tissue typhoon in a test of dexterity

1750
03:02:09,260 --> 03:02:15,739
The contestants must empty two standard tissue boxes alternating between both the left and the right hand. I'm awake. I'm awake

1751
03:02:15,819 --> 03:02:20,940
I'm awake. Raise your corresponding hand to remove tissue from the box remove. She's got to go like

1752
03:02:25,280 --> 03:02:28,989
Are you ready you got a minute to win it go get it

1753
03:02:33,090 --> 03:02:38,469
The game begins in three two one

1754
03:03:30,049 --> 03:03:34,450
I just sneezed. I actually just sneezed. I held it in like a champ though

1755
03:04:01,920 --> 03:04:03,920
I cry at the boobies

1756
03:04:04,430 --> 03:04:08,670
That's not an achievement. That's a statement. Do you want to stay and play or dash with the cash?

1757
03:04:11,010 --> 03:04:12,530
No

1758
03:04:12,530 --> 03:04:15,299
stay

1759
03:04:15,379 --> 03:04:17,700
That was the realest no you're ever going to hear me do

1760
03:04:18,420 --> 03:04:25,920
Put the studio next door filming to add I don't want to do it skip

1761
03:04:27,040 --> 03:04:30,079
No, no, no skip skip skip skip skip skip. I don't want to fucking do this. It's stupid

1762
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:39,979
How's it hanging?

1763
03:04:39,979 --> 03:04:43,360
Okay, I remember this one you go

1764
03:04:43,360 --> 03:04:48,479
Is the elephant one in this challenge the contestant must hang a banana from a string attached to their waist

1765
03:04:48,959 --> 03:04:55,760
Using the momentum generated by their hips the player must swing a banana to knock several oranges across the floor and into a hoop

1766
03:04:56,319 --> 03:05:01,979
To move walk or run in place

1767
03:05:08,430 --> 03:05:17,809
Are you ready you've got a minute to win it the game begins six I can do this

1768
03:05:18,770 --> 03:05:20,770
three two

1769
03:05:20,770 --> 03:05:33,059
One great job

1770
03:05:33,860 --> 03:05:43,520
What the fuck is happening?

1771
03:05:50,899 --> 03:05:54,100
Three seconds left

1772
03:06:01,469 --> 03:06:03,469
Get the fuck in there

1773
03:06:23,379 --> 03:06:39,010
Good ass game. Oh, you didn't win the challenge a fucking shitty algorithm

1774
03:06:44,420 --> 03:06:51,700
This is the final 60 seconds in the competition now you can do it. You've got a minute to win it go get it

1775
03:06:55,540 --> 03:06:57,540
the game begins in

1776
03:06:58,639 --> 03:07:00,639
three two

1777
03:07:00,639 --> 03:07:20,540
one

1778
03:07:28,739 --> 03:07:32,659
This is the stupidest fucking thing i've ever seen in my life 30 seconds left

1779
03:07:44,590 --> 03:08:03,280
Why?

1780
03:08:03,280 --> 03:08:23,940
Yes, i'm actually shredding this game

1781
03:08:41,790 --> 03:08:45,549
You have the choice to take the money and run or stay and have some fun

1782
03:08:46,510 --> 03:08:56,129
This is your level five blueprint

1783
03:08:58,909 --> 03:09:00,909
All right, I haven't done this one yet

1784
03:09:04,979 --> 03:09:10,129
bucket head

1785
03:09:10,129 --> 03:09:15,569
A ping pong ball weighs one tenth of an ounce and has a diameter of approximately 1.5 inches

1786
03:09:15,969 --> 03:09:21,969
In this challenge the contestant must bounce the ball from the floor to the wall and catch it in a bucket attached to their head

1787
03:09:24,049 --> 03:09:26,930
Hold either hand out to the side to grab a ball

1788
03:09:28,209 --> 03:09:30,610
Perform an overhand throwing motion to throw

1789
03:09:31,969 --> 03:09:35,239
Move left or right by stepping in that direction

1790
03:09:36,780 --> 03:09:41,389
Let's go

1791
03:09:41,389 --> 03:09:48,510
This is your last 60 seconds now you can do it. You've got a minute to win it recorded five lines

1792
03:09:51,010 --> 03:09:53,010
The game begins in

1793
03:09:54,139 --> 03:09:56,139
three two

1794
03:09:56,139 --> 03:10:07,219
one

1795
03:10:20,879 --> 03:10:22,879
What are you doing? I can't see shit

1796
03:10:33,329 --> 03:10:37,010
This is the most unintuitive piece of shit i'm shredding it right now

1797
03:12:24,979 --> 03:12:33,809
It actually what it's it's like wants to come out. I didn't even do anything. It wanted to do this

1798
03:12:34,129 --> 03:12:40,540
It was like i'm coming out. You saw clearly I was over here. The xbox is over here

1799
03:12:40,860 --> 03:12:58,000
All right, i'm gonna do this safely

1800
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:01,180
Shred it how many how many of these exist?

1801
03:13:03,700 --> 03:13:08,180
How many of these exist like is guyfury's minute to win it on xbox connect like a commodity?

1802
03:13:08,899 --> 03:13:40,239
I need like a surface to put this on let's get my fucking table over here. There are too many

1803
03:13:41,579 --> 03:13:45,739
It's five bucks on ebay. All right, well i'm just gonna fucking recycle these these things anyway

1804
03:14:00,670 --> 03:14:05,809
All right, don't try this at home unless you have a shredder that's capable

1805
03:14:08,079 --> 03:14:11,760
Don't even do that. Anyways, this could take up to fucking five like 5 000 credit cards

1806
03:14:22,719 --> 03:14:26,399
Seriously, though, don't fucking don't try this at home. I'm a professional. This is a professional shredder

1807
03:15:27,729 --> 03:15:31,729
What do I get the biggest shredder to shred the little shredder that didn't shred the fucking thing that you're supposed to be able to shred

1808
03:15:31,729 --> 03:16:15,870
In the shredder you can shred credit cards. You can shred plastic you shred it. It's it's I want I want my money back on that one

1809
03:16:15,870 --> 03:16:16,989
I think

1810
03:16:16,989 --> 03:16:46,639
Fix it there. All right, so you want us to play it you want me to play that game?

1811
03:16:46,959 --> 03:17:05,379
There's nothing to clean. What are you talking about? What do you mean play that game? Oh, we'll play in a different one

1812
03:17:05,860 --> 03:17:12,510
We're gonna play a classic game

1813
03:17:18,129 --> 03:17:28,399
And I ain't shredding it. Don't try that at home. That's a real disclaimer that then don't you get hurt

1814
03:17:28,399 --> 03:17:32,239
Don't fucking do that. Not with the midlife professional shredders. Don't fuck around

1815
03:17:32,959 --> 03:18:03,329
Here we go. Did you unplug it? Yeah, it's fine. It's don't worry

1816
03:18:04,690 --> 03:18:06,690
It's unplugged. It's safe

1817
03:18:06,690 --> 03:18:13,010
safety only

1818
03:18:13,010 --> 03:18:23,840
Get a polenta

1819
03:18:23,840 --> 03:18:54,639
This is connect sports show the dip. I will I will later. We've got to move on rare. We've rare made these games

1820
03:18:57,920 --> 03:19:00,799
No, that's right rare did make like all the connect games. That's right

1821
03:19:05,860 --> 03:19:08,100
They put rare on like connect only

1822
03:19:14,930 --> 03:19:16,930
Pick the player. What are you talking about? Oh

1823
03:19:32,770 --> 03:19:46,530
Let's go

1824
03:19:46,530 --> 03:19:48,530
I control everything

1825
03:19:48,610 --> 03:20:02,049
How do I how do I get the game to go? Oh, I have to okay

1826
03:20:11,819 --> 03:20:21,969
main event soccer bowling

1827
03:20:22,450 --> 03:20:28,590
What's the best one?

1828
03:20:28,590 --> 03:20:31,229
Boxing. Okay, is the boxing good on this?

1829
03:20:32,510 --> 03:20:34,510
It's pretty damn fun

1830
03:20:35,620 --> 03:20:37,620
Uh against computer you can do a good setup

1831
03:20:38,020 --> 03:20:40,659
How would you do?

1832
03:20:40,659 --> 03:20:42,819
You face each other and like fight each other in a room

1833
03:20:43,459 --> 03:20:48,579
I feel like that'd be dangerous

1834
03:20:48,579 --> 03:20:52,719
Okay, let's go

1835
03:20:52,719 --> 03:20:57,899
Let's hear your supporters cheer

1836
03:21:00,110 --> 03:21:08,879
tornado gardens

1837
03:21:13,229 --> 03:21:26,989
Am I gonna fight an old man i'm gonna fight like a fucking seven-year-old man

1838
03:21:27,870 --> 03:21:34,190
That doesn't seem right. Let's give these people a good show. All right, wait, what?

1839
03:21:34,750 --> 03:21:38,340
We can expect something quite special from this pair

1840
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:51,219
All right, I guess we're gonna go punch to strike your opponent right? I mean obviously punch high

1841
03:21:53,889 --> 03:21:55,569
Or punch low

1842
03:21:55,569 --> 03:22:10,209
Pull your shoulder back before you punch to add power and knock your opponent back

1843
03:22:11,010 --> 03:22:13,600
Pull your shoulder back

1844
03:22:13,600 --> 03:22:17,700
That

1845
03:22:17,700 --> 03:22:19,700
Okay, that's that's a power punch

1846
03:22:20,180 --> 03:22:22,799
And this is a block

1847
03:22:22,879 --> 03:22:27,569
You got it

1848
03:22:27,649 --> 03:22:29,250
Or block no

1849
03:22:29,250 --> 03:22:39,579
Wait, you go like this?

1850
03:22:39,579 --> 03:22:41,100
Okay, let's go

1851
03:22:41,100 --> 03:22:59,500
I'm sorry. I don't want to fight the old man, but I have to apparently

1852
03:23:03,969 --> 03:23:23,760
Oh, he got me

1853
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:31,020
Oh, he's out

1854
03:23:31,020 --> 03:23:36,579
He's out

1855
03:23:36,819 --> 03:23:52,690
Do I know does it automatically move forward?

1856
03:24:09,200 --> 03:24:12,319
Oh, I knocked him up. He's been knocked out

1857
03:24:29,360 --> 03:24:31,360
I like to move it move it

1858
03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:35,500
How could I do that

1859
03:24:35,500 --> 03:24:37,500
It's all right. Wait, it's recording

1860
03:24:47,680 --> 03:24:50,370
He's crying

1861
03:24:58,979 --> 03:25:00,420
Continue

1862
03:25:00,420 --> 03:25:07,680
Do you go through other players that are better than you are?

1863
03:25:09,489 --> 03:25:11,489
You look tough. What a tough guy

1864
03:25:12,049 --> 03:25:14,670
Play boxing, right?

1865
03:25:14,670 --> 03:25:27,860
Let's get this show on the road

1866
03:25:41,149 --> 03:25:45,950
No, that okay, that's my okay. So let's so who do I fight now the same person

1867
03:25:49,899 --> 03:25:52,620
Kevin again, I don't want to beat up kevin again

1868
03:25:53,340 --> 03:26:09,649
Strike your opponent. All right. I guess we're going to beat up kevin one more time before I go play soccer

1869
03:26:28,159 --> 03:26:30,159
This feels bad

1870
03:27:05,219 --> 03:27:09,059
So, how would you do this with two people in the room I've no I don't understand that

1871
03:27:09,780 --> 03:27:19,700
I think gaining health

1872
03:27:37,469 --> 03:27:41,309
Scream somebody just screamed

1873
03:27:56,909 --> 03:27:58,909
It was kevin's mom

1874
03:28:20,829 --> 03:28:27,700
It's gonna be this again hide my video I don't want you recording me

1875
03:28:28,940 --> 03:28:40,590
All right, let's try soccer

1876
03:28:40,590 --> 03:28:42,590
You owe kevin an apology

1877
03:28:44,239 --> 03:28:47,149
I'm sorry kevin

1878
03:28:47,149 --> 03:28:51,950
I did not mean to punch you in the face enough times where you were unconscious

1879
03:28:57,680 --> 03:29:16,639
Right, let's change this. Okay skill level. Let's go with professional. I like it action

1880
03:29:17,200 --> 03:29:38,159
Okay, now how do you do soccer on this of someone who really knows their soccer?

1881
03:29:38,879 --> 03:29:42,719
We are seconds away from kickoff now. So let's get down to some superb

1882
03:29:43,920 --> 03:30:04,399
No, I can move my hands

1883
03:30:04,399 --> 03:30:07,600
attacking kick in the direction you want to pass the ball

1884
03:30:10,379 --> 03:30:13,840
So go back turn this way kick

1885
03:30:14,719 --> 03:30:16,659
Okay

1886
03:30:16,659 --> 03:30:18,899
When you reach the goal kick to shoot

1887
03:30:20,530 --> 03:30:21,489
Kick

1888
03:30:21,489 --> 03:30:25,760
That's a very high quality animation. That looks great

1889
03:30:29,569 --> 03:30:30,530
All right

1890
03:30:30,530 --> 03:30:33,579
I'm gonna go for it

1891
03:30:37,680 --> 03:30:51,260
That's a throw in but slide or

1892
03:30:54,219 --> 03:30:56,219
The line shows you where the ball will go

1893
03:31:00,620 --> 03:31:02,620
All right, get in the path

1894
03:31:02,700 --> 03:31:04,700
And then what put the foot up?

1895
03:31:05,090 --> 03:31:08,989
Heal the ball

1896
03:31:08,989 --> 03:31:12,270
Get any part of your body to the target to save the shot

1897
03:31:13,659 --> 03:31:16,450
Okay

1898
03:31:16,450 --> 03:31:18,450
This is gonna be I think it's gonna be fun

1899
03:31:18,690 --> 03:31:20,690
This would be pretty interesting actually

1900
03:31:20,690 --> 03:31:25,979
Here we go

1901
03:31:25,979 --> 03:31:32,979
The keeper now kicks the ball to a fellow player

1902
03:31:33,700 --> 03:31:41,469
Kick it up here

1903
03:31:41,469 --> 03:31:42,510
score

1904
03:31:42,510 --> 03:31:59,379
Over that one

1905
03:31:59,379 --> 03:32:19,780
shit

1906
03:32:19,780 --> 03:32:21,780
Look at that replay

1907
03:32:22,260 --> 03:32:25,059
That replay was fucking so stupid

1908
03:32:27,729 --> 03:32:29,729
Clears the ball upfield

1909
03:32:50,879 --> 03:32:52,879
What

1910
03:32:59,950 --> 03:33:17,809
Come on what did I pass it backwards? All right

1911
03:33:30,379 --> 03:33:32,379
That's a penalty

1912
03:33:42,239 --> 03:33:46,399
Get it again

1913
03:34:01,170 --> 03:34:25,340
This is fun, I like this one clear of the goal mount what oh shit

1914
03:34:33,920 --> 03:34:46,319
I don't even know how to do that style shot. What is a style shot?

1915
03:34:50,559 --> 03:34:54,479
Ah, here we go. I was wondering if you could do that

1916
03:35:08,239 --> 03:35:15,979
What does that

1917
03:35:26,909 --> 03:35:28,909
Fuck gotta do it again

1918
03:35:37,489 --> 03:35:40,930
He's cheering i'm cheering him on go for it. You can do it

1919
03:35:42,909 --> 03:35:47,489
good kick

1920
03:35:47,489 --> 03:35:48,770
No

1921
03:35:48,770 --> 03:35:55,149
No

1922
03:35:55,149 --> 03:35:56,829
I was paying attention

1923
03:35:56,829 --> 03:36:11,360
That was a workout

1924
03:36:12,879 --> 03:36:20,030
Why does it look like my pants my pants don't

1925
03:36:20,989 --> 03:36:24,899
Why my lower body looks like it's not part of my upper body

1926
03:36:25,540 --> 03:36:29,760
All right. Why do I have like humpy dumpy pants?

1927
03:36:30,559 --> 03:36:32,860
Doesn't look like somebody like just screwed me on

1928
03:36:33,739 --> 03:36:45,500
It's weird. It's a two per yeah, it's two person

1929
03:36:46,139 --> 03:36:52,270
All right change for it

1930
03:36:52,270 --> 03:36:59,860
All right, I got uh beach volleyball. I'm gonna do

1931
03:37:00,579 --> 03:37:06,059
What do I want to do?

1932
03:37:06,059 --> 03:37:08,059
Table tennis sounds like fun

1933
03:37:12,219 --> 03:37:14,219
Bowling i'll do bowling after we'll do one

1934
03:37:14,459 --> 03:37:21,250
Stay with that professional skill level, too

1935
03:37:21,729 --> 03:37:33,100
That makes the most sense

1936
03:37:35,100 --> 03:37:43,629
So it's right in I think so we've got a professional gamer here

1937
03:37:45,340 --> 03:37:47,340
I'm gonna take a shower after this

1938
03:37:49,500 --> 03:37:51,500
I'm like 5 000 degrees right now

1939
03:37:55,520 --> 03:37:59,760
I'm gonna i'm gonna take a bath. I'm just gonna lie in the bath. I'm gonna lie in the bathroom

1940
03:37:59,760 --> 03:38:01,840
Just go under just move my hair around

1941
03:38:02,639 --> 03:38:07,950
I'm not doing those movements

1942
03:38:08,030 --> 03:38:21,139
Oops for this match

1943
03:38:21,139 --> 03:38:24,979
Reach to the right or left would you call yourself a table tennis star?

1944
03:38:25,700 --> 03:38:27,700
Reach with your arm straight out

1945
03:38:27,860 --> 03:38:31,540
I'd call myself a only play table tennis when it's part of a video game like this

1946
03:38:32,420 --> 03:38:34,420
And never any other surface

1947
03:38:36,579 --> 03:38:40,299
Same thing with tennis

1948
03:38:40,299 --> 03:38:43,500
Tennis to me whenever I played tennis was always just to end up being

1949
03:38:44,059 --> 03:38:46,780
Okay, here we go. It's really really a finesse based game

1950
03:38:46,860 --> 03:38:50,459
But you just yeah, I just hit it so hard every time it just soars over the whole thing

1951
03:38:51,500 --> 03:38:52,860
I can't do it

1952
03:38:52,860 --> 03:38:55,979
It'll be like i'll get one volley like don't don't

1953
03:38:57,170 --> 03:38:59,809
And the thing will just it's like I I can't do it. It's gone

1954
03:39:03,309 --> 03:39:05,309
It always goes like way out of control

1955
03:39:09,100 --> 03:39:11,809
Move backwards that shit. Sorry. All right, let's go

1956
03:39:13,600 --> 03:39:16,399
With the paddle right hand to the action we go

1957
03:39:26,590 --> 03:39:39,459
Stop celebrating you idiot

1958
03:39:41,219 --> 03:39:43,219
We're off screen

1959
03:39:43,299 --> 03:39:58,190
I'm just staying way back

1960
03:40:02,940 --> 03:40:05,100
That's it I got it right on the side

1961
03:40:05,819 --> 03:40:14,579
That works

1962
03:40:23,790 --> 03:40:27,120
All right, i'm gonna go as hard as I can

1963
03:40:45,920 --> 03:40:47,920
You stink

1964
03:41:00,879 --> 03:41:02,879
Fuck I was trying to give him a thing to serve up

1965
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:11,500
You know how much it costs

1966
03:41:11,500 --> 03:41:13,500
to license that song

1967
03:41:13,739 --> 03:41:15,420
for it to play

1968
03:41:15,420 --> 03:41:17,420
for one or two seconds

1969
03:41:19,500 --> 03:41:22,540
That has that has to be hundreds of thousands of dollars to license that song

1970
03:41:23,260 --> 03:41:27,739
You're gonna have a whole montage with that song or it's not worth it

1971
03:41:29,120 --> 03:41:31,120
Okay, okay

1972
03:41:50,219 --> 03:42:01,729
That's so stupid I crossed the plane of the connect that was a smash

1973
03:42:07,340 --> 03:42:09,340
And turn the fucking song off

1974
03:42:25,899 --> 03:42:43,059
Yeah, that's at six five I got my eye on you buddy, this is an even game such an evenly matched game this

1975
03:42:52,979 --> 03:42:57,069
Shit

1976
03:43:43,200 --> 03:43:53,969
I'm gonna lose. I'm out of gas. I've breathed a gas already. It's only been like four and a half hours. I'm out of gas already

1977
03:44:09,790 --> 03:44:27,069
Yeah

1978
03:44:44,899 --> 03:44:52,700
A great match joke. Oh well intense

1979
03:44:55,940 --> 03:44:59,170
That didn't even been four hours it's been four

1980
03:45:05,899 --> 03:45:16,930
I know it's got the d to my property. Is that what we were playing for? I wasn't aware

1981
03:45:26,049 --> 03:45:28,049
All right time for bowling

1982
03:45:28,110 --> 03:45:30,110
Everybody wants to see bowling

1983
03:45:30,290 --> 03:46:00,299
Throw your hands overhead. All right, let's go

1984
03:46:00,860 --> 03:46:07,149
It's kind of getting dark in here. I think I need to turn the lights up just a little

1985
03:46:08,399 --> 03:46:10,399
While we have some lighting

1986
03:46:17,520 --> 03:46:22,799
Neon lanes enjoy welcome and thanks for joining for what looks like

1987
03:46:31,950 --> 03:46:43,620
Spin on the ball maybe possibly reach to the right or left to pick up a ball

1988
03:46:45,440 --> 03:46:47,440
Reach with your arms straight out

1989
03:46:47,920 --> 03:46:49,680
Okay, and then back

1990
03:46:49,680 --> 03:46:50,879
forward

1991
03:46:50,879 --> 03:46:54,559
Swing your arms straight back and then forwards to bowl the ball

1992
03:46:56,930 --> 03:46:58,930
Yeah, what about spin?

1993
03:47:01,540 --> 03:47:13,500
Spin is very important. What how do I do it? If you want to add spin bring your arm across your body

1994
03:47:19,260 --> 03:47:37,819
Let's go

1995
03:47:37,819 --> 03:47:49,600
Not bad. Not bad

1996
03:47:49,760 --> 03:47:56,659
Interesting approach there

1997
03:47:56,659 --> 03:47:58,659
All right, sarge your turn

1998
03:47:59,739 --> 03:48:05,569
Oh, you got a strike, okay

1999
03:48:06,350 --> 03:48:17,680
I would have loved to seen it

2000
03:48:17,680 --> 03:48:19,680
No, i'm trying to do like a cool thing

2001
03:48:26,139 --> 03:48:46,219
That means you got to okay i'll believe it sure

2002
03:48:54,030 --> 03:49:02,350
Bullshit spare

2003
03:49:02,750 --> 03:49:05,979
Oh, come on

2004
03:49:05,979 --> 03:49:07,260
That sucks

2005
03:49:07,260 --> 03:49:10,780
It's a product placement ball

2006
03:49:10,940 --> 03:49:21,729
How so this guy just only gets strikes?

2007
03:49:22,370 --> 03:49:32,159
Give one to me, too. Uh

2008
03:49:32,159 --> 03:49:44,270
spare

2009
03:49:44,270 --> 03:49:45,870
finally

2010
03:49:45,870 --> 03:49:48,239
Geez

2011
03:49:48,239 --> 03:49:50,239
I have to earn these

2012
03:49:50,959 --> 03:49:56,000
Well, it's all right. He'll choke like four or five times three pins two pins three pins three pins four pins three pins three pins I win

2013
03:49:58,239 --> 03:50:15,180
I'm getting destroyed

2014
03:50:18,430 --> 03:50:20,430
I would have been cool, but I actually spun

2015
03:50:29,459 --> 03:50:37,520
Yes, this game tried to one up we sports you can smell the desperation

2016
03:50:49,920 --> 03:50:51,920
I have to get some strikes where this is it

2017
03:50:59,280 --> 03:51:00,639
Come on

2018
03:51:00,639 --> 03:51:02,879
We sports is way better

2019
03:51:02,879 --> 03:51:05,840
We remember like we sports you could like go all the way back here and be like

2020
03:51:06,479 --> 03:51:08,719
Bang and it would spin all the way down

2021
03:51:09,680 --> 03:51:13,780
You could go like what?

2022
03:51:28,219 --> 03:51:30,219
Wasn't average uh bowling

2023
03:51:31,790 --> 03:51:33,629
score

2024
03:51:33,629 --> 03:51:35,629
Like 150 120

2025
03:51:36,030 --> 03:51:41,790
It's not the other how did it spin the other way?

2026
03:51:43,360 --> 03:51:45,420
How did it spin the other way?

2027
03:51:45,420 --> 03:51:59,180
You know fuck it. We're going on here

2028
03:52:26,659 --> 03:52:29,379
I didn't think you could do I didn't think you could do that

2029
03:52:37,649 --> 03:52:39,649
You can actually break it

2030
03:52:46,020 --> 03:52:48,260
That's this is better than we sports because of that alone

2031
03:52:50,110 --> 03:52:51,920
Might be

2032
03:52:51,920 --> 03:52:57,280
Oh, no, you got eight pins for the first time. Oh, no, who knows? Oh god. Oh god

2033
03:52:58,159 --> 03:53:10,700
That's not I was trying to do the diaper technique

2034
03:53:10,940 --> 03:53:14,270
It went wet that went way too fast what i'm trying to do

2035
03:53:24,559 --> 03:53:28,559
Anytime somebody makes fun of you when you go bowling

2036
03:53:29,200 --> 03:53:33,100
Let's take and you do that and you get like four or five strikes

2037
03:53:34,239 --> 03:53:36,239
Don't ever feel ashamed of that

2038
03:53:36,899 --> 03:53:38,899
Well people listen echo like

2039
03:53:41,340 --> 03:53:43,340
No, cool cool

2040
03:53:43,420 --> 03:53:45,420
I went like this

2041
03:53:45,420 --> 03:53:48,459
Straight down going really slow enough to every single fucking pin over

2042
03:53:49,360 --> 03:53:52,319
It's not how cool you look doing it. It's how many pins you knock down

2043
03:53:53,120 --> 03:54:04,430
That'd be not true

2044
03:54:04,430 --> 03:54:08,340
It's how many pins you knock down

2045
03:54:08,340 --> 03:54:11,780
You could turn around backwards and go like this through your legs

2046
03:54:12,420 --> 03:54:14,979
That doesn't matter. Did you knock down all the pins?

2047
03:54:42,139 --> 03:54:44,139
94 not even 100

2048
03:54:59,299 --> 03:55:04,079
Bullshit absolute dog shit

2049
03:55:13,090 --> 03:55:17,809
I leveled up some real highlights in that game

2050
03:55:18,610 --> 03:55:35,709
He's still level one. I well, how do you level up in this game?

2051
03:55:36,590 --> 03:55:38,829
I don't get it. I don't understand

2052
03:55:42,379 --> 03:55:44,379
You lost to 10 pinwheels

2053
03:55:45,020 --> 03:55:48,319
Clever

2054
03:55:48,319 --> 03:55:50,799
That was that was cute. That was cute. You're right

2055
03:55:59,139 --> 03:56:03,540
All right tracking field. I feel like i'm gonna do really good at it. Just moving your body violently around in the circle

2056
03:56:03,780 --> 03:56:05,700
We're gonna go champion. I'm gonna get here we go

2057
03:56:10,049 --> 03:56:14,049
This is all about just moving violently like shaking violently

2058
03:56:16,690 --> 03:56:17,969
I should nail it

2059
03:56:17,969 --> 03:56:27,649
You're gonna break a bone

2060
03:56:27,729 --> 03:56:30,129
That's not you can't break your bone here unless I like slipped

2061
03:56:30,930 --> 03:56:31,250
Okay

2062
03:56:31,250 --> 03:56:36,450
If I was going like freaking out like wildly moving around and then I went like that my leg flew up underneath and I

2063
03:56:36,610 --> 03:56:38,610
Went back and landed like on my neck or something

2064
03:56:40,209 --> 03:56:54,659
But that's impossible

2065
03:56:54,659 --> 03:56:56,260
What happened to my hair?

2066
03:56:56,260 --> 03:57:01,219
I just have a hat on so it's easy to keep it away from like because I you saw how it looked the other time

2067
03:57:01,299 --> 03:57:02,579
We played this

2068
03:57:02,579 --> 03:57:04,819
It was all over the place. It looked crazy

2069
03:57:06,260 --> 03:57:09,719
I looked crazy and I didn't want to look crazed anymore

2070
03:57:13,219 --> 03:57:17,860
Comes the falling gag 100 meter finals. Now you can feel the tension

2071
03:57:21,620 --> 03:57:23,620
Okay, let's go shake

2072
03:57:24,739 --> 03:57:27,219
Run in place lift your knees

2073
03:57:28,100 --> 03:57:31,700
See here what's here's what i'm gonna try here because i'm not taking my knees i'm not taking my feet off the ground

2074
03:57:32,180 --> 03:57:34,180
See if I can just go with my back here

2075
03:57:34,340 --> 03:57:45,469
i'm just

2076
03:57:45,469 --> 03:57:50,430
Hey, what you doing mind and body in perfect harmony. That's what breaks world records

2077
03:57:50,909 --> 03:57:55,200
All right, here we go

2078
03:57:55,200 --> 03:58:21,040
Keeping your own way. Oh, that's like pretending to be an airplane

2079
03:58:29,600 --> 03:58:31,600
All right javelin I will

2080
03:58:38,610 --> 03:58:40,610
I'll just go again

2081
03:58:41,489 --> 03:58:44,770
Grab a javelin reach with your arms straight out

2082
03:58:45,569 --> 03:58:48,430
Okay

2083
03:58:48,430 --> 03:58:50,670
Run in place to get to the throw zone

2084
03:58:53,090 --> 03:59:02,270
Hold the javelin when the ground turns green throw the javelin throw

2085
03:59:03,069 --> 03:59:13,379
Throw high. All right. That was pretty. All right, let's go

2086
03:59:14,100 --> 03:59:20,899
And this throw needs to be good

2087
03:59:32,370 --> 03:59:34,370
What the fuck come on, man?

2088
03:59:35,170 --> 03:59:53,440
Now the results from that event have been processed. We can see where we're at 32 is so bad

2089
03:59:54,399 --> 03:59:56,399
Failure is not an option

2090
03:59:59,899 --> 04:00:22,819
Make what you will of that

2091
04:00:23,860 --> 04:00:28,500
Third throw now, how do these athletes cope with such tension?

2092
04:00:29,459 --> 04:00:39,760
Oh my fucking god

2093
04:00:39,840 --> 04:00:49,020
Let's see how that event's results affect where we stand

2094
04:00:50,059 --> 04:00:52,799
At this point in time, that's how it's looking

2095
04:00:53,680 --> 04:00:59,040
Then what's the spring javelin high jump discuss what are we discussing?

2096
04:01:00,399 --> 04:01:06,000
Is that like a debate platform run in place to get to the jump zone

2097
04:01:07,620 --> 04:01:09,219
Lift your knees

2098
04:01:09,219 --> 04:01:14,079
I will I will destroy the discuss

2099
04:01:14,879 --> 04:01:18,799
I could sit there and talk about anything for hours. I will people will leave because i'll bore them

2100
04:01:19,680 --> 04:01:21,680
Okay, so run room jump

2101
04:01:21,680 --> 04:02:05,120
I have to like explode out of this a firm footing and is what's needed here. It's got to be a record

2102
04:02:05,760 --> 04:02:18,370
The previous event's results make

2103
04:02:20,129 --> 04:02:25,780
Second jump and an improvement is vital now. Stop moving

2104
04:02:34,209 --> 04:02:37,469
Fucking dumb game

2105
04:02:37,469 --> 04:02:39,549
I don't know how to like make it go faster

2106
04:02:40,510 --> 04:02:44,430
Just take a look at the results from the previous event

2107
04:02:47,760 --> 04:02:49,200
No, stop

2108
04:02:49,200 --> 04:03:01,090
I figured it out. I figured it out

2109
04:03:09,170 --> 04:03:14,979
The result now from the previous event and look at that

2110
04:03:15,780 --> 04:03:20,579
A lead is starting to open up. This competition is really close

2111
04:03:21,219 --> 04:03:23,860
Thank you for dropping into the discus event

2112
04:03:24,739 --> 04:03:26,739
Okay, disgust throwing

2113
04:03:26,819 --> 04:03:29,139
I think when you stand

2114
04:03:29,219 --> 04:03:35,540
At a certain length of way and you throw it the most power comes from when you're spinning around the momentum

2115
04:03:38,399 --> 04:03:41,219
Lol

2116
04:03:42,739 --> 04:03:59,620
That's it don't you just spin face to build from with their first attempt

2117
04:04:17,790 --> 04:04:20,219
If I went like this

2118
04:04:22,299 --> 04:04:26,559
I'm just a fucking clown. I'm like the comedy routine that's here at the olympics

2119
04:04:27,200 --> 04:04:41,110
The pressure is on straight into the sky

2120
04:04:43,440 --> 04:04:48,229
Like that person's not even trying that person's not trying

2121
04:04:52,049 --> 04:04:58,229
As we thought third throw and if ever there had to be success

2122
04:05:03,239 --> 04:05:06,760
Results from the last event and my my take a look

2123
04:05:08,600 --> 04:05:12,040
Take a look at these scores who would have believed it

2124
04:05:13,440 --> 04:05:20,879
It's daunting for the athletes, but the hurdles are next. I can't do it

2125
04:05:21,680 --> 04:05:23,680
I need some fucking help

2126
04:05:26,319 --> 04:05:35,030
Lift your knees

2127
04:05:35,030 --> 04:05:38,629
As soon as the hurdle turns green jump in place

2128
04:05:40,799 --> 04:05:42,799
Jump with both feet off the ground

2129
04:05:59,590 --> 04:06:03,110
Do any of these athletes have what it takes to beat the current world record?

2130
04:06:11,280 --> 04:06:29,520
Oh, why is it in my way?

2131
04:06:38,549 --> 04:06:49,049
You know what fuck all this I ain't crossing

2132
04:06:50,010 --> 04:07:55,270
Athlete it was the taking part that mattered you that's like i'm trying not to fall over

2133
04:08:02,379 --> 04:08:04,860
That's like i'm shimmying on the edge of the cliff

2134
04:08:05,420 --> 04:08:21,079
Volleyball is the last one time for some beach volleyball

2135
04:08:34,180 --> 04:08:37,379
How many connect games came out for the xbox one?

2136
04:08:39,180 --> 04:08:40,860
I want to say three

2137
04:08:40,860 --> 04:08:50,579
There was so many but 360

2138
04:08:55,450 --> 04:08:58,409
All right, so volleyball is just table tennis for the bigger ball larger people

2139
04:08:59,370 --> 04:09:16,139
Well podrick paddles

2140
04:09:20,219 --> 04:09:22,219
You gotta be tall to play volleyball

2141
04:09:26,040 --> 04:09:28,920
All volleyball players ever known for like six two

2142
04:09:32,340 --> 04:09:34,340
You gotta like get over the net and like stuff

2143
04:09:47,959 --> 04:09:52,360
People paddle toss the ball upwards then hit it with your hand as it falls

2144
04:10:01,559 --> 04:10:04,920
Move to the target and hit the ball with your hand and then

2145
04:10:12,149 --> 04:10:19,989
Jump as soon as the jump indicator appears jump and jump and then you have to stop it jump jump

2146
04:10:22,729 --> 04:10:31,350
All right, I got it

2147
04:10:38,790 --> 04:10:40,790
What just fucking happened

2148
04:10:43,370 --> 04:11:01,079
I have no idea what's going on. Okay service passes to the other side now synchronization for this guy

2149
04:11:08,600 --> 04:11:10,600
Oh big dive

2150
04:11:40,040 --> 04:11:53,459
Oh nice

2151
04:12:08,180 --> 04:12:27,530
Shit my my my body is so sweaty. I can't keep my earphones in

2152
04:12:38,420 --> 04:13:02,200
Two hands

2153
04:13:03,959 --> 04:13:11,319
Is that legal

2154
04:13:28,520 --> 04:13:30,520
Serve it up, let's go

2155
04:13:32,040 --> 04:13:46,420
Jump higher than that. Why are you waiting so long? You're killing me

2156
04:13:48,139 --> 04:13:50,139
Change it. He's killing me

2157
04:13:50,780 --> 04:14:01,209
The team are playing like clockwork today

2158
04:14:16,010 --> 04:14:42,899
Come on pretty good

2159
04:15:02,389 --> 04:15:07,959
I'm blaming it all on my teammate. See how far i've jumped i've jumped really high

2160
04:15:25,079 --> 04:15:27,000
I am too

2161
04:15:27,000 --> 04:15:32,700
I just threw the game i'm tired

2162
04:15:34,979 --> 04:15:36,340
i'm tired

2163
04:15:36,340 --> 04:15:44,340
Nothing in the air. How can you not take a picture in the air?

2164
04:15:47,100 --> 04:15:51,340
Like why give me up here jumping in the come on, you don't want to be in there

2165
04:15:52,299 --> 04:16:06,440
I want to get some water

2166
04:16:06,440 --> 04:17:30,469
water time

2167
04:17:30,469 --> 04:17:31,510
All right

2168
04:17:31,510 --> 04:17:43,909
I'm back. So what can I do now?

2169
04:17:43,989 --> 04:17:50,440
I need to slam something

2170
04:17:50,920 --> 04:17:52,920
My oxygen tank

2171
04:17:55,350 --> 04:17:57,829
I can't do it anymore. I just can't do it

2172
04:17:58,709 --> 04:18:03,450
What what's more game?

2173
04:18:03,530 --> 04:18:07,940
mini games

2174
04:18:07,940 --> 04:18:11,030
one bowl roll

2175
04:18:11,030 --> 04:18:12,469
one bowl roll

2176
04:18:12,469 --> 04:18:15,239
What is that?

2177
04:18:24,629 --> 04:18:26,629
I guess you just roll it once

2178
04:18:29,190 --> 04:18:31,190
Don't worry xbox. I'm gonna

2179
04:18:31,590 --> 04:18:36,790
i'm gonna

2180
04:18:36,790 --> 04:18:40,309
in like another 15 to 20 minutes, i'm gonna probably call it

2181
04:18:41,110 --> 04:18:46,229
I don't know what it is, but you know what it is. It's probably because I was like sick over the last like yesterday the day before

2182
04:18:47,450 --> 04:18:49,530
My like physical energy levels are like zero

2183
04:18:50,329 --> 04:19:06,409
All right, here we go. Oh, I said, okay, I get it

2184
04:19:19,420 --> 04:19:25,059
Get it finicky is too it's not like the levo. You know what I mean? It's like

2185
04:19:26,020 --> 04:19:46,379
I shred the connect

2186
04:19:57,639 --> 04:20:04,229
Give me one

2187
04:20:04,229 --> 04:20:08,760
zero

2188
04:20:08,760 --> 04:20:11,350
Just roll it straight

2189
04:20:11,350 --> 04:20:14,629
I'm sorry. Hold on. Let me play. Let me roll a ball on the connect

2190
04:20:17,219 --> 04:20:19,219
Okay, then uh translates to

2191
04:20:40,459 --> 04:20:41,979
team mobile

2192
04:20:41,979 --> 04:20:45,110
All right new video game that one is

2193
04:20:45,510 --> 04:20:47,299
stupid

2194
04:20:47,299 --> 04:20:49,690
I want to do

2195
04:20:49,690 --> 04:20:53,290
Super saver and no. Yeah, I want to do super saver

2196
04:21:01,850 --> 04:21:04,659
Do han solo

2197
04:21:04,659 --> 04:21:07,059
No, I already a five-star expert at that game

2198
04:21:07,700 --> 04:21:11,430
I'm not doing that again

2199
04:21:11,430 --> 04:21:17,579
And then I shred it down. So i'm sorry. I can't it was one of the games I shredded earlier

2200
04:21:18,139 --> 04:21:34,389
All right, so just block balls

2201
04:21:37,059 --> 04:21:43,079
You can do better than that come on

2202
04:23:26,020 --> 04:24:02,180
My face what okay, why green why doesn't it just why do you have to have the green background?

2203
04:24:02,979 --> 04:24:05,670
Why can't it just be a an image?

2204
04:24:06,069 --> 04:24:20,780
Now let's see what else is here javelin sprint

2205
04:24:30,010 --> 04:24:31,129
distance

2206
04:24:31,129 --> 04:24:41,500
Let's get your running shoes on

2207
04:24:41,659 --> 04:24:45,989
I gotta perfect this

2208
04:24:45,989 --> 04:24:52,520
What do I mean? My screen is always green

2209
04:24:53,159 --> 04:24:56,409
This could be a tough one. What does that mean?

2210
04:24:58,940 --> 04:25:00,940
Streams does is playing haunt

2211
04:25:01,540 --> 04:25:06,739
Ah, fuck does it really? No, it doesn't it should say games and demos you gotta refresh

2212
04:25:07,540 --> 04:25:15,540
Yeah, I switched that a while ago. It'll be today's champion

2213
04:25:17,420 --> 04:25:18,860
All right, let's go

2214
04:25:18,860 --> 04:25:20,860
I'm gonna try to get this over at least like 80

2215
04:25:23,110 --> 04:25:26,469
Gearing up for that all important first attempt

2216
04:25:27,670 --> 04:25:32,549
So i'm just gonna throw it out to the side like just frisbee it like that like this

2217
04:25:34,469 --> 04:25:39,020
That was terrible

2218
04:25:39,020 --> 04:25:41,020
That was awful, but I don't

2219
04:25:41,340 --> 04:26:00,709
Let's try it again. Oh, is that it?

2220
04:26:01,530 --> 04:26:05,370
Cannot afford to make one mistake here. The pressure is on

2221
04:26:12,579 --> 04:26:14,579
Come on 50 something 40 something

2222
04:26:31,290 --> 04:26:35,639
All right, this one's gonna go over 50

2223
04:26:35,719 --> 04:26:37,159
third attempt

2224
04:26:37,159 --> 04:26:39,719
And it really really has to count

2225
04:26:49,420 --> 04:26:56,809
What happens if you drop it at the olympics count, you know, what if you picked it up and you turn zero shit drops it

2226
04:26:58,170 --> 04:27:00,569
You can do it again, right? Like clearly that was not your throw

2227
04:27:01,610 --> 04:27:09,829
I'm not gonna play hot solo again

2228
04:27:10,950 --> 04:27:19,190
Has it not happened?

2229
04:27:19,190 --> 04:27:22,389
Can you actually spin? No, I don't think you can I think you just put your arm back

2230
04:27:23,110 --> 04:27:31,829
All right. I think that's it

2231
04:27:31,829 --> 04:27:33,350
bump bash

2232
04:27:33,350 --> 04:27:35,959
body ball

2233
04:27:35,959 --> 04:27:55,110
body ball

2234
04:27:55,110 --> 04:27:56,790
We need hans

2235
04:27:56,790 --> 04:28:56,579
I'm not shredding it. I'll fucking do that at home. You get one star wars

2236
04:28:57,459 --> 04:28:59,459
Han solo connect dance

2237
04:28:59,700 --> 04:29:16,969

Pretty cool. Oh do be careful with your selections. I'm told some of these files are highly restricted

2252
04:31:17,909 --> 04:31:34,700
I knew r2. It's a touch operated interface. They clearly hadn't invented neural sequencing

2253
04:31:34,780 --> 04:31:37,260
We can view the data in detail from the briefing room

2254
04:31:39,020 --> 04:31:43,760

God, I don't know what it is about moving around. I'm too old

2315
04:43:34,549 --> 04:43:36,740
I really might be too old

2316
04:43:36,740 --> 04:44:02,630
Move this up

04:44:54,889 --> 04:44:56,889
You got rid of the whole crux

04:45:00,310 --> 04:45:02,310
No, but like honestly honest to god

04:45:02,950 --> 04:45:07,110
Like yeah, like you can shred CDs if you have a paper shredder that can do them

2324
04:45:07,909 --> 04:45:09,909
Don't fuck around with that like

2325
04:45:10,810 --> 04:45:13,529
If your shredder is not actually capable, don't do that

2326
04:45:14,409 --> 04:45:16,409
You'll fuck up your shredder

2327
04:45:16,409 --> 04:45:20,630
Let's make that triple clear

2328
04:45:20,630 --> 04:45:33,900
We're doing shredder safety

2329
04:45:33,900 --> 04:45:36,139

04:46:04,659 --> 04:46:06,200

It really is

2337
04:46:12,700 --> 04:46:14,220
I remember when I had

2338
04:46:14,220 --> 04:46:21,669
I had all four of my wisdom teeth taken out. It was not fun

2339
04:46:24,150 --> 04:46:26,459
Your face ends up like getting

2340
04:46:26,540 --> 04:46:28,220
all swollen

2341
04:46:28,220 --> 04:46:38,950
I don't even know how it gets that swollen either. How does your face actually get to that point?

2342
04:46:40,740 --> 04:46:43,619
But after like a week or two you're back to normal. Hopefully you're doing all right

2343
04:46:45,369 --> 04:46:47,770
Hopefully you're not too sore from all the uh

But I was not feeling well yesterday. I wasn't feeling that great this morning either, but i'm all right

04:49:43,909 --> 04:49:48,090
Fiestos no, it's like I don't know what that means. I'm not gonna say it again

I can't even right now. I can't even do this right now. What the fuck

2383
04:51:25,500 --> 04:51:27,979

I love the stream with jbuffet after the live rumble. Yes

2390
04:52:14,169 --> 04:52:18,509
There will be a whole other stream after the carnival the week after the carnival

2391
04:52:19,770 --> 04:52:20,889
where

2392
04:52:20,889 --> 04:52:22,889
There'll probably be a lot of behind the scenes footage

2393
04:52:23,290 --> 04:52:25,290
There'd be a lot of things to talk about

2394
04:52:25,369 --> 04:52:27,369
I think andy mark is actually going to

2395
04:52:28,009 --> 04:52:31,209
um, give me some stuff maybe potentially to show

2396
04:52:32,979 --> 04:52:34,979
so there will be a

2397
04:52:35,299 --> 04:52:36,979
kind of ask

2398
04:52:36,979 --> 04:52:39,459

2400
04:52:46,409 --> 04:52:48,569
It should be really really really cool

2401
04:52:49,130 --> 04:52:50,659

04:58:27,990 --> 04:58:31,509
Why do we get the credits rolling?

2466
04:58:33,369 --> 04:58:35,369
There's still some bits to do but let's get it rolling

2467
04:58:36,569 --> 04:58:40,810
I will see you guys tomorrow for super mario rpg legend of the seven stars

2468
04:58:41,450 --> 04:58:43,450
It's going to be a nostalgia stream tomorrow

2469
04:58:46,459 --> 04:58:49,209
If I were you

2470
04:58:49,209 --> 04:58:50,569

2471
04:58:50,569 --> 04:58:52,970

2472
04:58:58,650 --> 04:59:00,889
But thank you everybody all the subs

04:59:00,889 --> 04:59:03,290

Much love to you all

2475
04:59:13,189 --> 04:59:15,669
Super mario RPG is the best snas game. I would

2476
04:59:17,750 --> 04:59:18,950
I would agree

2477
04:59:18,950 --> 04:59:24,060
Chrono triggers up there, too

2478
04:59:24,220 --> 04:59:28,299
There are a few and most of honestly like at least the top five

2479
04:59:29,020 --> 04:59:31,180
Super nintendo games for me are rpgs

2480
04:59:34,069 --> 04:59:36,150
At least three of the top five I think are

2481
04:59:36,790 --> 04:59:41,259
That was just kind of the golden era for rpgs

2482
04:59:42,139 --> 04:59:44,439
turn-based at least

2483
04:59:45,099 --> 04:59:46,779
But thank you to

2484
04:59:46,779 --> 04:59:52,299
Uh tingy for the 250. I was talking about the first game where it makes you put your hands

2485
04:59:52,860 --> 04:59:54,139
to your side

2486
04:59:54,139 --> 04:59:57,180
Still as a board and turning your shoulders you kind of look like this

2487
05:00:04,279 --> 05:00:07,319
So many of these games required so much like random t posing

2488
05:00:16,099 --> 05:00:18,659
Yeah, like like a like a luge

2489
05:00:19,619 --> 05:00:21,930
I did do this a lot. You're right

2490
05:00:27,380 --> 05:00:36,279
You are right

2491
05:00:36,279 --> 05:00:38,439
That is a terrifying sport by the way

2492
05:00:39,240 --> 05:00:45,130
What a scary sport. This is

2493
05:00:45,979 --> 05:00:47,259
Don't you go?

2494
05:00:47,259 --> 05:00:49,900
More than 50 60 70 miles per hour on this thing

2495
05:00:50,540 --> 05:00:53,419
Can you imagine the speeds?

2496
05:00:58,819 --> 05:01:01,189
you just on like

2497
05:01:01,430 --> 05:01:03,430
What abouts to a potato wedge?

2498
05:01:05,900 --> 05:01:08,139
That takes some skill to be able to maneuver that thing around

2499
05:01:14,549 --> 05:01:17,029
But thank you tingy. Thank you bone jackal for the five dollars

2500
05:01:18,709 --> 05:01:22,310
Jeremy you may not believe me, but you were my substitute teacher back when I was in middle school

2501
05:01:26,229 --> 05:01:32,229
Is the rest of this comment is is just is just just horseshit. Um, i'm not gonna read the rest of this

2502
05:01:34,549 --> 05:01:38,310
I like that's this is not real and i'm not i'm not gonna even read it

No, okay. Thank you for the five dollars

2506
05:01:58,040 --> 05:02:01,240
Bone jackal the bullshitter. Yeah, that's that's the new nickname there

2507
05:02:03,259 --> 05:02:05,259
Being rude to your old students

2508
05:02:07,000 --> 05:02:11,319
Hey, why don't you scroll back and see what they wrote and then tell me if you want me to say that on stream

2509
05:02:12,409 --> 05:02:14,409
Hey lieutenant campbell. Thanks for the 250

2510
05:02:18,259 --> 05:02:23,860
Hey, jeremy longtime viewer first time tipper. Just want to say don't let the balders and olders get you down

2511
05:02:24,340 --> 05:02:28,180
You have hair that rivals matt mercer's and he's an actual god made flesh

2512
05:02:28,979 --> 05:02:30,979
I'm gonna be hunkered down for the hurricane

2513
05:02:31,220 --> 05:02:33,220
Reaming into florida. I hope

2514
05:02:34,340 --> 05:02:37,700
Uh, that's true. Everybody stay safe. Uh, is that is it here now?

2515
05:02:38,900 --> 05:02:47,290
I know that was that was happening in the next day or so

2516
05:02:49,639 --> 05:02:53,880
Take care of yourselves guys. Your safety is way more important than anything else

2517
05:02:54,599 --> 05:03:13,029
I wonder when it's at when it's gonna be over. Is it miami?

2518
05:03:14,069 --> 05:03:18,220
Something like that, right?

2519
05:03:18,299 --> 05:03:20,860
Just be careful guys. That shit is scary

2520
05:03:24,310 --> 05:03:28,310
Do what you need to do stock up on things you need to stock up on make sure your friends and family are safe

2521
05:03:29,189 --> 05:03:31,430
hurricanes are no joke, especially when they're

2522
05:03:33,290 --> 05:03:35,930
As powerful as they you know, possibly could be with this one. So

2523
05:03:36,569 --> 05:03:45,189
But I wish you the best of luck

2524
05:03:45,189 --> 05:03:47,189

Wink death. Thanks for the 250 on my birthday. I had a dream my parents got you to come to my party and we talked for

05:04:19,959 --> 05:04:22,259

He sees you in your dreams

2540
05:05:06,220 --> 05:05:08,220
Didn't our real monsters used to do that

2541
05:05:10,790 --> 05:05:14,950
That was the whole premise of that show, right? They would you'd be sleeping and they would like crawl into your ears

2542
05:05:17,180 --> 05:05:19,349
And give you nightmares and stuff

That's a scary show

2544
05:05:31,400 --> 05:05:33,400
No, that's true. Yeah

2545
05:05:33,799 --> 05:05:37,639
Our real monsters that was their job. Wasn't it? That was part of their career

05:07:39,900 --> 05:07:41,740
That's really really cool

2568
05:07:41,740 --> 05:07:44,709

05:07:53,939 --> 05:07:55,860
Hey nefarious bear. Thanks for the three dollars

2572
05:07:55,860 --> 05:07:59,380
Thanks for being one of the only streamers to make me bust my gut laughing on a regular basis

2573
05:07:59,860 --> 05:08:03,220
If you're still taking videos, here's an extremely late green screen video

2574
05:08:04,340 --> 05:08:11,700
Uh, we're gonna hold on to it add it to the list of things. We're going to have a submission room probably this weekend

2575
05:08:12,659 --> 05:08:20,119

Content showcase we're gonna do it once a month or so

2579
05:08:31,189 --> 05:08:33,189
When we feel like we have

2580
05:08:33,430 --> 05:08:34,709
enough stuff

2581
05:08:34,709 --> 05:08:36,709
There is no deadline on these things

2582
05:08:37,270 --> 05:08:41,189
It's not oh, well, you have to get it in there by uh, september 6th

2583
05:08:41,590 --> 05:08:43,590
Otherwise, there's no way it's ever going to be shown

2584
05:08:44,389 --> 05:08:48,470
No, it's just going to be an open submission platform on that discord channel

2585
05:08:49,750 --> 05:08:54,549
And we're just going to take stuff. I'm going to pull stuff into some slides and we're just going to make it

2586
05:08:55,590 --> 05:08:56,790
there'll be

2587
05:08:56,790 --> 05:08:58,790
Obviously rules for submitting

2588
05:09:00,729 --> 05:09:02,250
But there's no deadline

2589
05:09:02,250 --> 05:09:05,610
Tomorrow is in like 30 minutes. Well, it'll be there within the next few days

05:09:06,250 --> 05:09:09,849
In the discord channel. Also, there is discord channels for

05:09:12,810 --> 05:09:19,689
Which I keep like pushing forward and forward and forward and forward but it will happen that stream is going to happen once there's enough

2593
05:09:20,090 --> 05:09:22,090
Uh interesting stuff that comes in

2594
05:09:22,490 --> 05:09:24,090
activity wise

2595
05:09:24,090 --> 05:09:27,930
I mean backwards and i'll put pushing backwards and backwards back not forward

2596
05:09:28,569 --> 05:09:38,310
But thank you to fairies bear. I look forward to seeing it. Is the activity book stream even real it will be

Today is hatsune miku's birthday. Did you remember to tell her happy birthday? Happy birthday

2604
05:10:16,549 --> 05:10:24,040
Happy birthday

2605
05:10:24,119 --> 05:10:25,560

2607
05:10:26,759 --> 05:10:36,709

2608
05:10:36,709 --> 05:10:40,630
That's the the the sega pop star, right?

2609

That's the pop star made by sega

2612
05:10:55,080 --> 05:10:57,479
I couldn't tell you one of the songs

2613
05:10:58,790 --> 05:11:00,630
I don't know any of them

2614
05:11:00,630 --> 05:11:02,069
I just

05:11:02,069 --> 05:11:04,069
Know that they keep making games

2616
05:11:04,630 --> 05:11:12,250
I don't know what they are. I know they're like singing and dancing games

2617
05:11:13,130 --> 05:11:19,930
Song games does hatsune miku have albums or is it just games rhythm games?

2618
05:11:25,430 --> 05:11:38,360
There no there are songs. It's just a music program. I don't know. All right. Well, i'll make sure to play the entire

artificial existence

05:11:56,650 --> 05:12:00,040
I guess all right, let's have it. I guess i'm gonna say it again

2626
05:12:01,720 --> 05:12:03,720
She created minecraft

2627
05:12:04,580 --> 05:12:05,540
Wow

2628
05:12:05,540 --> 05:12:08,139
That's quite an achievement

2629
05:12:08,139 --> 05:12:11,740
Superintendent chalmers. Thanks for the 250. Hey germa. I heard you were going to do a gta stream

2630
05:12:11,740 --> 05:12:13,740
Will it be before or after the carnival?

2631
05:12:17,029 --> 05:12:19,830
Yeah, I really did want to do a gta casino stream

2632
05:12:24,299 --> 05:12:25,020
but

2633
05:12:25,020 --> 05:12:26,619
I don't know maybe

2634
05:12:26,619 --> 05:12:28,939
Maybe i'll just who cares and just join a public lobby

2635
05:12:29,580 --> 05:12:31,580
You gotta be careful though

2636
05:12:32,389 --> 05:12:35,270
Isn't gta the the easiest game on earth

2637
05:12:36,229 --> 05:12:38,229
To have your like ip just get grabbed

2638
05:12:38,790 --> 05:12:40,790
That's why I haven't done it yet

2639
05:12:47,509 --> 05:12:49,509
Yes, it is. Yeah

2640
05:12:50,360 --> 05:12:51,930
Yeah

2641
05:12:51,930 --> 05:12:53,930
That's roblox

2642
05:12:57,580 --> 05:13:00,860
You can literally hack into single player gta 5 games

2643
05:13:05,139 --> 05:13:06,500
How would you even?

2644
05:13:06,500 --> 05:13:08,500
I do I do use a vpn

2645
05:13:11,930 --> 05:13:14,569
But to me, I don't know. I haven't used a vpn for that long

2646
05:13:14,810 --> 05:13:18,090
I really feel like a vpn is a guy that like is standing outside

2647
05:13:18,970 --> 05:13:23,130
My door and like you know, what if you punch the guy in the face that's standing there guarding the door?

2648
05:13:24,970 --> 05:13:26,970
He just falls over is it possible

2649
05:13:28,580 --> 05:13:30,580
If yes, it is a paid vpn

2650
05:13:39,259 --> 05:13:40,619
Oh, okay

2651
05:13:40,619 --> 05:13:49,000
cool

2652
05:13:49,000 --> 05:13:50,520
nice

2653
05:13:50,520 --> 05:13:54,790
All right, maybe I will do it then

2654
05:13:54,790 --> 05:13:57,029
All right, that sounds like fun

2655
05:13:57,029 --> 05:13:58,389
Add to the list

2656
05:13:58,389 --> 05:14:03,400
But thank you superintendent chalmers. Yeah. Yes. The answer is yes. I do still want to do that. Thank you gunther for the 250

2661
05:14:19,740 --> 05:14:22,060
And finally we have choco 80

2662
05:14:22,779 --> 05:14:25,529
for the 250

2663
05:14:25,529 --> 05:14:30,490
Hey germa, i'm the one whose mom thought I was shouting when you were shouting before in another stream

2664
05:14:33,060 --> 05:14:37,619
Anyways today she came in when I had you on the tv and asked frantically. Is he cussing?

2665
05:14:38,419 --> 05:14:40,099
You weren't

2666
05:14:40,099 --> 05:14:42,099
Good. All right

2667
05:14:43,979 --> 05:14:47,099
But remember this is if this is an r-rated pg-13 stream

2668
05:14:49,139 --> 05:14:51,139
Right. This is a pg-13

2669
05:14:51,860 --> 05:14:55,459
With like i'm i'm dip i'm dipping my toes into r-rated

2670
05:14:56,340 --> 05:15:01,209
Pg-13 can only say the f word once

2671
05:15:03,099 --> 05:15:06,099
one per stream

2672
05:15:06,099 --> 05:15:08,099
No, it's an r-rated pg-13

2673
05:15:08,580 --> 05:15:18,229
stream

2674
05:15:18,229 --> 05:15:20,009
Yes

2675
05:15:20,009 --> 05:15:22,869
So it's r-rated

2676
05:15:22,869 --> 05:15:26,009
No

2677
05:15:26,009 --> 05:15:28,009
It is an r-rated

2678
05:15:28,970 --> 05:15:30,970
pg-13

2679
05:15:32,200 --> 05:15:34,330
stream

2680
05:15:34,330 --> 05:15:49,880
How is that so hard to understand

2681
05:15:56,779 --> 05:16:06,279
Explain that one because I can't no there's no rating on this stream

2682
05:16:07,159 --> 05:16:11,049
Tomorrow, we're gonna play super mario rpg and i'm not gonna say one swear word

2683

Uh guy got cut in half by a guillotine

2685
05:16:18,220 --> 05:16:20,540
It's an r-rated pg-13 stream

2686
05:16:29,689 --> 05:16:34,279
And that's the end. I will see you guys tomorrow

2687
