1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,500
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Gonna be playing Candles tonight. Heard it's pretty ridiculous, a lot of jumpscares.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,679
So if you don't like jumpscares then, well that's too bad, you're gonna get scared. Scare Saturdays.

4
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,929
Bang! Alright, Candles. Get a nice little bonfire here, we're out camping.

5
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:36,310
Enter the forest. Why is my mouse still on the screen? Oh there we go, it's gone now.

6
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,579
Okay, here we go. Playing Candles.

7
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:52,530
Ooh, um, I can't see anything. Wait, can I go down here? Yeah, I can.

8
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,469
So the whole purpose of this game is I'm supposed to light candles in my haunted house.

9
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:02,869
That's the only thing I read about. Just gonna follow the path.

10
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:09,099
What a weird path. Am I gonna like fall off the edge of the world here?

11
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:15,950
Oh, there's a jump button, okay. Jump. Jump!

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:23,379
What kind of house does this person live in? Are you serious? Where do you park your car?

13
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,989
Can I go in?

14
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:31,019
This is small text.

15
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,019
While you've been away, your basement generator must have run out of fuel,

16
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:41,019
thus your house has been overrun with the dark, loving night imps that scour these parts of the coastline.

17
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:47,200
As you know, they usually like fish, and what they... I don't... I cursive...

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,219
You know what? Gotta turn on lights. That's all I need to know, right?

19
00:01:52,219 --> 00:02:01,480
Oh dear. It is really dark in here. Turn it on!

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,170
Come on, the game's called Candles! Turn the light on!

21
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,560
Oh, my game just like froze. Why can I not turn this on?

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,800
The game is called freaking Candles. I should be able to turn the candles on.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,620
Oh, okay. There's one candle lit.

24
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:31,389
God, this game keeps like freezing! Quit freezing on me, bro!

25
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:36,490
There's a candle in this room. Where is it right here? Lit.

26
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,409
There's another one. Hey, look at that. There's another one in the corner.

27
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:50,900
And one more, right? Yes.

28
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,819
Hey, we lit up the room! Is that like a picture of like... Who is that?

29
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,819
Is that Larry Bird from the Boston Celtics?

30
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:04,409
No, it's like Grover Cleveland.

31
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,900
All right. Is it gonna freeze again?

32
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,169
Hmm. I think I'll need to get my key to this door from my bedroom.

33
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:16,780
Easy. And this one.

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,099
Oh! Oh, whoa!

35
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:24,460
There's a person in there! There's like a demon in this room!

36
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:33,699
Oh! What am I supposed to do?

37
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:41,639
What am I supposed to do? Do I have to walk in there?

38
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,949
I don't have to walk in this room, do I? Are you kidding me?

39
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,949
Oh, dear Lord!

40
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:55,050
Candle! There's a candle in here! He can't get me.

41
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,740
He can't get me. There's a candle in the room.

42
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,099
You piece of crap!

43
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:06,479
I thought that... No, that's just the shadow of the chair.

44
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,479
I thought that because he was a horned being. He was a horned beast.

45
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,490
See how it looks like a horned beast?

46
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,459
Oh, sh... Turn on! Turn on the candle!

47
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:22,750
Dear God! Is that the only candle?

48
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,990
I think that's the only one in this room.

49
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:32,180
Looking... Can I open the fridge? Is that blood?

50
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,420
I hate this game already.

51
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:44,670
Oh! Oh! I'm going this way.

52
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,939
These candles are lit.

53
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,350
Damn it, man! Damn it!

54
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,420
Something tells me I have to go in here.

55
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,420
Well, true. We'll go back. If I need to, I'll go back.

56
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:06,279
There's no light in this hallway.

57
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,350
Jeez! Oh!

58
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:18,009
I figured it out. I gotta bring these mother effers to the light.

59
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,129
That's how you kill them.

60
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,129
So I gotta drag that one dude that's in that... Oh, the key's in here.

61
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:28,139
Where's the key? It's a pretty huge key!

62
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:31,949
This is the key to my house.

63
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,949
Sick like giant three-foot wooden key.

64
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:40,379
I can get into the cellar.

65
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,060
I gotta get this guy. This one guy in here.

66
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:49,870
Alright, come on out. Come on out, you son of a bitch.

67
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,870
Come on. Come on out!

68
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,819
Come on! Did I die?

69
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,730
This is the bedroom.

70
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,220
Wasn't there a dude in here?

71
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:18,310
I forget. I forget. I forget.

72
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,259
Okay, all these are turned on.

73
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:23,430
Get the key again.

74
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,420
Oh, god.

75
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,420
Where's the light? Oh!

76
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
Oh, my...

77
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,899
This one was so easy last time.

78
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:53,370
Give me the giant wooden key.

79
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,269
Come on.

80
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,269
Why are the doors closed behind you?

81
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:02,500
Alright, come on.

82
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Come on, man. Just come over to me.

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,860
There's a candle right to the left. Can I do it?

84
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:24,829
There's one more room.

85
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:25,829
There's a guy right here.

86
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:31,620
Come on. Come out. Come out, you piece of crap.

87
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,069
Come out. I'm gonna have to run to the desk.

88
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,920
Three, two, one, go!

89
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,879
What? He should have died from the light.

90
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,879
Oh, you...

91
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,319
Turn on.

92
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,319
Thank you. Alright, I'm back here.

93
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,319
Made it back safely.

94
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,879
I gotta get this guy out of this room.

95
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,879
Get out of that room.

96
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,879
You butthole.

97
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,449
I'm not the cellar, but there's one imp left in this room.

98
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,100
I don't know how to get rid of this guy.

99
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,100
I'm jumping onto the desk.

100
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:23,670
Okay, guys.

101
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,670
I have no idea how I'm gonna get out of this one.

102
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,449
It's on. It's lit.

103
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:31,879
How are you not dead?

104
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,879
How are you not dead?

105
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,879
Explain that to me.

106
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,820
The candle is on.

107
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
You should not be alive.

108
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Okay, I'm gonna go for like a jump over his head.

109
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Here we go. Jump over his head.

110
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
That didn't work.

111
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,090
Shit.

112
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,090
Here we are again.

113
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,840
Can I get this guy to chase me out here into this light?

114
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,000
Come on, man.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Come on. Look, I'm like a nice, like, succulent human.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Don't you want to eat me?

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't you want to eat me?

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, you do.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,179
You son of a bitch.

120
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,379
Need anything in here?

121
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,769
That's it.

122
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,710
All right.

123
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,710
Well, that does that.

124
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,490
Now I can go in the cellar, turn on the generator.

125
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,490
And I know that's what I have to do.

126
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:25,529
You can't get me in this light.

127
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,370
Come on.

128
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,370
Yeah.

129
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,370
Yes.

130
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,370
Yes.

131
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,720
The last light.

132
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,149
Where is this, like, supposed generator?

133
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,929
In here?

134
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:43,509
Damn it.

135
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:44,750
Damn it.

136
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,750
I can't see.

137
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,399
I can't see anything.

138
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,399
There's definitely one in here, and I'm just, like, locking myself in here with them.

139
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,399
Turn the light on.

140
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,139
Can I turn that on?

141
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,139
Turn on the damn generator.

142
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:02,139
How do I, like, turn it on?

143
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:07,070
Is it, like, a tool over here I can use?

144
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,940
There it is.

145
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,940
Why is this not turning on?

146
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,070
Come on, generator.

147
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:21,149
Generate some electricity.

148
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:22,149
I just, like, flung it on.

149
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:23,149
Can I, like, fling it?

150
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:24,389
Why?

151
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:25,389
It started to move.

152
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:26,759
Hold on.

153
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,759
Spin.

154
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,759
Spin.

155
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,759
I command you to spin.

156
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,730
There we go.

157
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,730
There we go.

158
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,139
I'm doing it.

159
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:42,159
Maybe not.

160
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,159
What the hell?

161
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,159
What kind of generator is this?

162
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:52,419
Not really working, are you?

163
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh!

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I got two lights on.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I got two lights on.

166
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I got two lights on.

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm almost...

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm almost got the generator on.

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,220
I can't believe this is how you do this.

170
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,220
This is the most, like, awkward way.

171
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,220
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

172
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,860
Spin.

173
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,860
Spin, you fool.

174
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,610
Spin.

175
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,299
Yes!

176
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,600
Yeah!

177
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,399
Oh!

178
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,399
Did I do it?

179
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,090
Oh, yeah.

180
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,090
Generator's on, baby.

181
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,970
That's how we do it.

182
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,779
All the lights are on, right?

183
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:31,779
If I get out of the cellar?

184
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:32,779
Oh!

185
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,730
Perfect!

186
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,730
See you later, monsters.

187
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,730
That's Candles.

188
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,730
If you want to go...

189
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,730
It's free.

190
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,610
Link will be in the description.

191
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,610
It's a jump fest, as you saw.

192
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,610
A lot of crazy screams that I'm not that proud of right now.

193
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,610
But anyways, guys, I'll see you all next time.

194
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,610
And, of course, take care, everybody.

195
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,610
Light the candles!

196
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,610
Bye!

197
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,610
Bye!

198
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,610
Bye!

199
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,610
Bye!

200
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,610
Bye!

201
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,610
Bye!

202
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,610
Bye!

203
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,610
Bye!

204
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,610
Bye!

205
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,610
Bye!

206
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,610
Bye!

207
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,610
Bye!

208
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,610
Bye!

209
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,610
Bye!

210
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,610
Bye!

211
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,610
Bye!
