1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:12,039
Okay, okay, all right. Did you tweet? I'm about to. Okay, I'm waiting for the retweet potential. It's right there?

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:25,129
It's very it's very boring. It's just a basic boring tweet. Yeah, but like I I would have to write my own. All right, so

3
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,210
Hey

4
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,410
What's up, everybody? How's everybody doing?

5
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:44,299
Welcome to Elden Ring Co-op. Which one of us will become the Elden Lord? Only one of us can. All right

6
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:52,810
Uh, I got everything going. Let's open this up. All right. Are we good? I think we're good

7
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,049
All right. So we here are two. I know there's no intro. I know I know I get we were so late

8
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,099
I just do that. Well, you need a little bit of intro. All right. Here's a little bit of an intro for you

9
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,099
There might be some people that you know, check the bars like I don't even know what this is. What are they doing?

10
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:15,379
Right. Okay. So we have installed your mic is weird. Oh

11
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:22,150
No, it's not one guy. I mean my mic is weird. Who said that?

12
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,500
Oh, it's a one. Okay. Why how is it possible that I could read that? All right

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,780
Anyways, so we have installed right now. We have the seamless co-op mod

14
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,329
Which means that we can both be in the game. We don't have to do any signs or soap stone things

15
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,409
We're just in the game together permanently

16
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:47,829
We also have randomizer on all the randomized enemies that we don't know what they are

17
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,189
We have no idea nice McDonald's voice time that person over a day

18
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:56,870
All of all of the items are randomized and all of the monsters are randomized and I believe even between us

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,109
We might have different random seeds for items

20
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:01,349
So what you pick up is going to be different than what I pick up

21
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,150
And the way the randomizer worked from the last time I used it is like every time you pick up like the basic

22
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,909
Roa berry, uh, that item is always a different item

23
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:13,830
It's not a different item every time you pick one of them up like a roa berry could be

24
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:20,870
Sledgehammer really you'll just constantly be picking up sledgehammer. Yeah. Yeah, I'm me strong by the way

25
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:24,389
This is me strong. I told you I promised a me strong playthrough and this is what it is

26
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:33,909
Uh, this is me smart inspired by blanca. If I roll you guys make lightning you do. Oh, all right

27
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:38,810
You guys ready? Are we wait make sure everyone is everybody here. Are you present?

28
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:43,930
There's a couple people missing stirs is it stir is quiet. Hold on. I'll fix it. I'll fix it stir

29
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,639
You're a little quiet. Let me turn you up. Okay. I'll talk a little louder

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,259
You don't have to do it. I got you say can you say you're like your abc's real quick?

31
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
a b c d e f g

32
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,219
h i j k l m n o p

33
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:59,979
I have a friend who can't recite the criken can't recite the alphabet

34
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,460
Did you get louder like how are you not louder for me right now? Um, I don't know. This is very bizarre

35
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,669
I'm turning you up in discord, but you're not being turned up at all to me. Uh

36
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,280
Pump up the volume pump it up pump up the volume

37
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,819
Okay, I turned you up as high as I could possibly turn you up. I think it's you you think it's me

38
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,340
All right, is that is that better because I don't know what's going on with what's wrong with it

39
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:34,379
Say your abc's one more time a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

40
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:46,060
I don't know what's wrong with you. What's wrong with me if I mess up like better. All right. All right, let's go. Okay

41
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:52,020
My apologies will come later. Oh, that's right

42
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,419
You have to go and look at a full apology like dude

43
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,740
Do you want to fight the boss or do you want to like I need like full attention to explain the like 10 step

44
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,340
Program of how i've ruined your day and like how we're never gonna talk again

45
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,409
No, all right

46
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:12,889
Let's let's fight dracula and then we'll talk about it. All right elden ring co-op with randomizers

47
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:17,430
I hope you remember the buttons because we kept drinking elixirs every time we went to go open a door

48
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:26,740
I remember hey, can we be the tutorial? No, you think we can be the tutorial boss. He's taking like no damage

49
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:40,100
Get good first person to die here. Um has to I don't know something funny

50
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:44,889
All right, you're gonna better queue up something funny

51
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:50,329
Get a first person to die something funny they have to do. Oh you have to do something funny

52
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,850
I've never been funny ever

53
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,730
You're supposed to be high right now

54
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,769
You don't know anything

55
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,209
I'm kidding. I'm

56
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:12,779
Don't please wait. Is that why you like you left the room before we started you go do like edibles?

57
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:27,339
No weird. No, are you like a delinquent streamer now? Are you like no hell what happened? I'm so concerned

58
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:33,500
What happens fond in the tutorial instantly died and now i'm watching your character with no health float

59
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,019
Just float just not moving float

60
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:44,259
Because i'm at a loading screen. Oh, yeah

61
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:51,540
All right. All right. So here's what we're gonna do. Uh, we're just gonna I mean

62
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Maybe this is why they wait. No, no, no, this is normal. This is normal. This happens. This is normal

63
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:03,529
We this is this is fine. We just have to read just restart. This is fine. I'm i'm you're gonna touch a shrine or

64
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,009
I'm I think we have to restart

65
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,009
No, go through the tutorial and rest at one of the bonfires. Yes. Okay. All right. All right. All right

66
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:16,360
We'll just just let everybody just chill out. We're good. Well, everyone just chill up chill out. Everything's fine

67
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,680
All right, we're just gonna exit. Okay. Yeah, there is always league of legends to

68
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,120
If this doesn't work, i'm not playing league of legends. Okay. All right. So just open the game up

69
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,279
That's not there's no problems at all. Like there's not a problem

70
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,740
Just the more that we focus on the negativity the more that it's going to cause a problem

71
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,399
So just open it back up get to a spot before you're closing the game

72
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,779
I I was stuck. Oh, i'm stuck too. Yeah, just I would just restart it get out to that first bonfire

73
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,939
The one with um, you know when you see like the big open area just relax

74
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:55,139
Yeah, I I had been told that you you had to get to the first bonfire and now I see why

75
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,579
Okay. All right. Just that's all right

76
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay

77
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,189
Everything is good to go. I'm just opening it again. Relax. I know a lot of people are like oh my god

78
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:16,649
Not like this. Everything's everything's going exactly that is not like this right that all that's all over we've all

79
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,170
Okay

80
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,889
so originally we were going to start when my food got here and I finished eating because we didn't want to get interrupted right and

81
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,550
Then my my food delivery man texted me saying hold on. I need to restart my car

82
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,990
Uh, because I because he was parked at the food place for like an hour

83
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:43,620
So that that was that's part one of why it was definitely my fault. My food was about an hour and 15 minutes late

84
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,980
Okay, and then also I tried to make everything easier for jerma and like tried to set some of this stuff up yesterday

85
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,519
And like I I was a little confused

86
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,519
I was like i'm gonna send you these files

87
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,519
And like everything that I did and everything I told him to do was wrong until at the very end

88
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,800
We were just like fine. Let's do it like just go through the steps

89
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,540
Just follow these steps and then everything worked but I I tried like three different ways

90
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,779
To give him

91
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,980
You were trying you were trying to make it so easy

92
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,019
Yeah, so easy and it ended up being so difficult. I made everything significantly harder

93
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,399
Okay

94
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,220
So I think i'm ready

95
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:33,269
I think i'm ready to you at that first like the one before you open the door before the the first bonfire that you can

96
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:42,549
Actually touch right? Yeah, um in the basement at the bonfire with the knife. I'm gonna turn you up a little bit more

97
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,399
Because it's people are saying you're still a little quiet

98
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:55,110
I can turn myself up a bit as well. Does that help talk say some stuff a b c d e f g h i j k elemental p

99
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:03,340
Is that better? We're good to go. All right. Is that good? Way better. Perfect. All right. Cool. All right. All right

100
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,440
Yeah, okay. Oh, yeah

101
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:17,480
All right, i'm coming in. Are you ready? I'm ready. I hope so you're at that first site of grace. I am turning this on

102
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:27,080
I'm I'm at the first site of grace. Yes. Oh, you can't see i'll turn it on. I'm

103
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:31,320
I can't contain it. I'm so excited. What the fuck was that noise? What?

104
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,919
It sounded like someone did a drive-by on you

105
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,759
What like I thought I just heard like a machine gun firing

106
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:45,610
No

107
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,269
All right. I'm that sounds like a bird in your room. Can you pick up this item? There's an item here

108
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:55,220
What is it? So is something weird? Oh dude

109
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,340
Why did I get so much stuff?

110
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:02,779
Sacred relic sword ash of wood. Did you get all these things?

111
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:09,659
I got I got a ripple blade and a smithing stone dude. I got all right

112
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:14,809
Our items are not the same by the way, but I got a lot of cool stuff. I can't even use it

113
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,600
Yeah, I can't equip it because we're

114
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:28,100
Well, whatever we have randomized loot does that cares? Yeah, it's gonna be a rough start before we can you know

115
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,009
Get something we can actually use that's an end game weapon. That's an end game boss weapon

116
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:39,929
Yeah, all right. The the big kicker is is this thing out here the same for both of us, right?

117
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,159
Well, the tutorial guy was already the same. So I think that's settled. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come back here

118
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,860
Okay, let's do a bit. No, no, no

119
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,220
I'm just saying like it's been a while since I played this remember the first time you opened this door

120
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,419
You went like this. Did you do this? I did I was like, holy shit

121
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,080
You know what? I the first thing I did is I walked out here

122
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,279
I saw the night and I said wow i've seen I haven't seen anything in this game other than a whole bunch of streamers

123
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,080
Waste their time fighting this for three hours at the start of their streams

124
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,720
I'm not gonna bore you guys with that and i'm gonna walk by it

125
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,399
That's what I did

126
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,360
David you're the type of player that like opens the wikipedia page the second you install. I don't I didn't no

127
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,159
I just that was the only thing I knew is that I didn't want to fight that enemy for like two hours

128
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,840
There's always one dark souls enemy in the beginning that it was like oh I can beat it

129
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And then they can't fucking beat it and they can't own up to that. They you didn't beat it, right?

130
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,389
How long did you fight it? Who is this by the way? Is this still the same character? Uh,

131
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:47,019
Yes, but I think they're what they're wearing is randomized. So they look different. Okay. Did you touch this touch it?

132
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,750
Let's take a let's take a little nap

133
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,250
All right. So by the way, keep in mind if either one of us sits at a bonfire it resets the whole game

134
00:11:54,809 --> 00:12:01,690
So we have to be we have to okay. What's that? That's uh tree spirit, right? Yeah. Okay. So

135
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,919
All right. What do you want to do?

136
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,720
um

137
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,019
Well, I I think I mean I know exactly what we should do but I want to leave it to you

138
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:19,480
So we don't have another terraria moment. I mean the I don't think there is a terraria moment. What's what do you what's this?

139
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,580
Ooh, what's it? Oh, that's not that's normal. Yeah. No, that was different for me. I mean we we have to go get the horse, right?

140
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:34,220
Oh something was different. Yeah, so okay the first thing you do you got to run up to the church and rest there

141
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,580
Yes, and then you run to the other bonfire and then you get the horse

142
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:44,600
But like I don't I see it like I already feel like i'm dragging you. No, no, no, that's what I would have done

143
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,539
Okay, well I need you to say what you're gonna do and then like I want to be like you're the strong one

144
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,299
And I trust you so you should do magic then you should be like a magic user

145
00:12:54,299 --> 00:13:00,659
I should be like the two-handed weapon user. Yeah, like ideally if I if I can find magic also, uh

146
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,850
Everything the merchant sells should also be randomized really. Oh a golden rune. Oh

147
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,539
Yeah, finding what's up, uh, like hero runes that you can pop in the early game are pretty funny. Look at that

148
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:26,309
I have a I have a tunic. Damn it. Okay. What do you got? Yeah, this is

149
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:37,539
Shit kindred of wrought ashes. I don't even know what the hell I want to do

150
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,539
Yeah, and one of the settings that I had enabled should exist. Um

151
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:46,580
The notes that they sell I think are hints to key items in case we can't find one

152
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,340
You can buy the notes from them and they'll be like, hey

153
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:58,059
Did you know that like the great rune is actually here take the giant's flame? I wouldn't screw up your game

154
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:06,500
What where oh you rest it the npc disappeared when you rushed it I was like, oh no

155
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,259
I'm super paranoid that like something else. I know but whatever

156
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:14,340
Look, it's it's a bunch of fucking mods. It's there's gonna be problems, right?

157
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,139
Okay

158
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:19,620
Well, then we gotta go up the road to the next bonfire so we can get our horse and also

159
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,899
Pick up any items we find so it's every single enemy is randomized

160
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:31,100
So that means that the random kind of tarnished that are walking around could just be like millennia. I believe so. Yeah

161
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:36,809
And they should be scary if they're if it is a boss, it's scaled down. This is still just a goat

162
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:56,500
This is the stuff. Wait, there's a hand they are scaled. All right, that's funny great dragonfly head. It's stupid

163
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,220
All right

164
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,740
I think the goats and stuff might not be randomized because they need to be

165
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:10,019
I don't know. I just all the animals aren't they're like not enemies. I don't know put it on

166
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:19,879
I don't think i've ever even seen that enemy in the game

167
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:27,740
All right, so we need to go wait. I can't open my map

168
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,580
Uh, because there's enemies targeting us that that flower is trying to kill us. Are you serious? All right. Well, it's scaled, right?

169
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,850
Yeah, they still take a million hits

170
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:53,580
I forgot I forgot. It's all right. Well, we'll we'll get there just stand on the poison. It doesn't matter. Just kill it

171
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,240
Are you dead? I thought it killed you in one hit. That scream made me think I was dead

172
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:16,649
Oh stagga stagga

173
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,330
I didn't know you could stagger the plants

174
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,620
Jesus christ

175
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,090
Okay, so what do we get for that?

176
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:36,809
Slumbering egg and an octopus. Oh free. I got trash. Let's get the bonfire in here

177
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:43,669
Oh, yeah, so we can be unpoisoned and we'll go the other way. Do you think we'll beat the first boss?

178
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,429
Uh, I mean the first boss

179
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,759
Could just be like a bandit. That's very true

180
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:59,669
Why are you still poisoned? Uh, i'm not you look you to me. You look like you're poisoned as well

181
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,190
Okay, let's just run we gotta get we gotta go get our dog

182
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:15,160
Somebody said we might have to restart the game one more time after this cutscene. Okay, somebody said stinky

183
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Yeah, you just have like the sims

184
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:27,059
Uh, like hygiene is zero right now. Well, it's kind of what it's like. All right, let's see what happens

185
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:42,259
Hmm. Are you just gonna skip this? Yeah, I skipped it. You're sitting on the ground stinking for me

186
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,369
Okay, I'm I'm talking

187
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,220
except

188
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,299
Oh, I didn't even I didn't even get to talk to her. Oh you didn't no

189
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,180
You see me walking around? Yeah, you're just kind of walking around. All right. What happens if you sit down?

190
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,680
I mean I did I got the cutscene, but I didn't get to talk to her afterwards

191
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,400
Oh, there is the talk to millennia option

192
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,759
I'd like to an auto trigger. How do we make it so we don't smell?

193
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:30,309
I kind of like the stink. I kind of feel at home. Okay

194
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:40,680
I don't want to look at that the whole time. We play I bet you if you die, it'll be gone, baby

195
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,319
I mean you're stinking for me, but i'm okay with that. I don't mind it's not a big deal

196
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:53,049
How do I how do I get to that? There it is. No, don't do that. I wonder okay

197
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,920
All right commander. What do we do now? All right now open world. We can go anywhere get on your horse

198
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:13,559
I forgot how to do that too. I gotta equip it. All right, so we need to like level up

199
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,009
Let's clear out and we need to find some items. How wait, how do you?

200
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,450
Jesus how do you bookmark? Okay, so hit start just the regular start menu you go use your d-pad to go all the way to the right

201
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,259
This is where I put it is over in that pouch menu

202
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:32,900
You hit y to switch and then you hold y to get to that sub menu. That's how I do it

203
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:51,690
I'm remembering that's the last see I've uh, yeah, we've all played this game, but it was like three years ago

204
00:19:52,490 --> 00:20:01,450
Let's feel like a while doesn't it? All right. So what's in the box for you? Oh, you don't stink anymore. Oh good

205
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:10,460
God's skin peeler got a perfume bottle. Do all this shit just takes I don't that thing's not bad, isn't it?

206
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,859
That thing's like really good

207
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,500
I need 17 strength and 22 dexterity

208
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,019
Oh, we need to establish a rule right now because we're finding different items

209
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,259
Are we allowed to drop items for the other person?

210
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,869
Like if I find a two-hander and you're like, oh dude, I want that right. Uh, what do you guys think?

211
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,099
I would say no unless a lot of essential

212
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,940
Uh, let's get a pull up. I think because i'm seeing if it's very it's very mixed. It's no. Yes. No, no

213
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,779
No, yes. Yes. Yes. I don't know. No. No. No. Yeah. Yeah

214
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:53,940
In the meantime found items. All right, let's click we have a problem. This person has a bunch of runes

215
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:00,250
I thought they're supposed to scale. I thought the enemy's scaled. I mean they do but

216
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:18,220
What why is it so much health? What's the ash of war with this thing? Our weapons just suck like i'm on a dagger

217
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:22,329
That's true. I'm gonna die

218
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,680
You know

219
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, I can't believe that I can't believe we're already fighting the first boss

220
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,960
I mean this this sort of is if you think about it

221
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:39,799
It really is

222
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,480
He's just so fast

223
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:51,980
All right. What do you actually want to play as because we need to figure this out. I gotta find something. I I wouldn't play magic

224
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,769
Skip it around

225
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:58,890
This looks so weird. You're kind of like boarding around a little. All right

226
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,299
We got it

227
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,779
Ooh

228
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:19,480
They didn't drop anything me strong the priest. I feel like you're just you're getting things

229
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,880
Yeah, my game's really fun. Yours doesn't sound very fun

230
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:30,859
My i've started on not fun mode. I have enough to level up. We should probably do that

231
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:33,420
Well, you're gonna respawn that fucking boss enemy

232
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,460
Yeah, but I mean we need to level up. We're let's clear. Let's clear this area

233
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:43,579
I think I actually have the stone shard starting item to open up the door and we can try and get random items

234
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:51,430
I think this map item is also probably random. Oh, this is okay. I'm gonna pick up this map item

235
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,390
Okay, it is a map. All right, I got it

236
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,480
You dead? Oh it dead

237
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,670
Uh, wait, one of the god skin bosses is right here. So, uh, I don't know what what we need to do

238
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:09,210
Should we run or should we fight it? I am still naked with a dagger

239
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,529
But but I I can take it. I am a cleric

240
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:28,869
I have no flasks. I'm the smartest caveman. All right, i'm going back and sitting at the bonfire. Are you coming? Sure

241
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:35,539
This is aggroed onto us right now. Well, then do it what happened to you?

242
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,490
Nothing happened to me, but everything reset. All right. What do we this is important?

243
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,839
Give him your armor. Well, he has to ask nicely for it. It was the pole

244
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:49,299
Uh, overwhelmingly. Yes to share items. Yeah

245
00:23:51,369 --> 00:24:05,539
That honestly surprises me. I mean I think I have to do strength to make this bearable

246
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:09,799
Well, I mean we can also just drop like end game boss weapons

247
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,140
Okay, do you yeah, do you want your gear here? How do I how do you drop something here? Now follow me?

248
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:20,019
Okay, this is my i'm my one directive. Okay, this is just following me. I'm gonna follow on your horse

249
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:31,109
Let's go. We ride watch out for the jelly, you know, all the like, uh,

250
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:37,829
The graves. Yeah that have a whole bunch of pickable like runes that are like there's like 10 runes on a whole bunch of

251
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:41,990
Well market great. We need to market. We gotta play. I'm not I kind of remember how to get there

252
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:49,859
But I don't remember where it is on the map. You sound like a dad like oh, yeah. I know I know where it is

253
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:54,579
Do you yeah, of course I do. I don't know where it is. But I know like the general here

254
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:58,200
I don't want a map. Hey, watch out for this giant rolling ball. You don't want to get you don't

255
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:02,950
Get squished by the ball

256
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,430
I think we should look at the map who needs a map. I don't want him. I I don't know how to look at the

257
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,910
Watch this

258
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:21,059
I do

259
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,019
I mean i'm in combat. I know you know what they look like on the map. They're like the little

260
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:33,319
Rectangles, I mean i'm pretty sure I know where i'm going

261
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,960
Do you?

262
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:50,539
Yeah, let's get this bonfire. Ooh

263
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,420

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,390
Okay setting down

Do we what about the painting? Oh, I got death root from the dude. It's a random item

266
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:10,299
I got an ancient dragon smithing stone

267
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:20,230
All right. I'm still falling. You seem to know where you're going. I'm lost

268
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,750
You really are aren't you tell me the truth. No, it's no it's this way

269
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,920
Tell me the truth

270
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,359
I'm not lost if I were lost i'd say so because I wouldn't want to like

271
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:35,579
Derail any further than I have today. No, okay. You're right. You got it

272

No, you had it right. Yeah right here right here. So let's uh, just loot loot up

273
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,599
This feels like cheating. I like it

00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:14,460
Blasphemous claw. I don't even remember what that is. It's like a throwable. What I have a legendary over there. Whatever it is

279
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:31,349
Tonic of forgetfulness. Yeah, I didn't I got the anchor if you want it remembrance of the dragon lord. Wait, hold on

That's a lot of souls dude, i'm gonna be like level 50 right now

283
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:50,819
We're gonna stomp through this game. Do you want did you get any actual armor?

284
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:57,529
I don't even know what this item is either actually. Uh, no, I still have no armor. How do I drop something?

285
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:07,380
I man, you know, I the poll said yes, but my my heart is still saying no your heart says no, okay. Yeah

286
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,299
I thought I was naked. I thought this dick was right there

287
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,569
I was like, oh my god. Oh god. Don't look don't look. Oh, that reminds me of a story

288
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,410
I was uh, I was getting the mods yesterday

289
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,490
So I was looking through the elden ring mod nexus

290
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,250
And I was just scrolling down to see other popular mods if there's anything else we could do

291
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,990
Oh, no, and then one came up and I was like, that's weird

292
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,299
Better nude model what objectively makes a nude model better than the other nude model and I clicked to open it

293
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:38,420
And then my wife walked in the room behind me and was like, what is that?

294
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:48,579
Somebody said don't scroll on nexus mods. Yeah, seriously popular mods you scroll down once and it's like

295
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,740
Do you want the naked?

296
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,019
Um doll the purple blue doll girl

297
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,779
Oh, we can also do that because it's night time if we go back to that bonfire

298
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,019
I forget how that works. You like rested it and she's like, oh

299
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,019
Oh, and you need that for the spirit things, but I imagine we're not summoning because we're already two people

300
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:07,660
All right. We've gone. Let's let's teleport back to

301
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,890
that church church of

302
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:19,930
Ella, right because then we'll probably get the cutscene we can i'm gonna love love like 30 times

303
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:31,430
Oh, it's a vote to warp. Oh, yeah, she was totally nude

304
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:40,230
But also she's a doll. It doesn't make sense warping takes forever for the non-host by the way. Okay, that's all right

305
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:49,369
Yeah, i'm already talking to her don't forget your helmet

306
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:54,150
I think she'll also give you a random item. She gave me a fire of blossoms

307
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:06,460
Now it is thine to do as thou wishest. All right. I have the spirit calling bell and a death root

308
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:11,980
I she's not even here, but I don't think it really matters. All right. I'm gonna level up like 15 to 30 times

309
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,910
Okay, i'm going to get one level. I can't level level three

310
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,299
It really looks like your dick's out dude, I know

311
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,450
But you didn't get any runes

312

They removed that really I thought we had the options when we tested it earlier didn't read the patch notes

339
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,440
Dude, don't you wish you could like just walking down here

340
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,920
Don't you wish you could delete your fucking memory and play elden ring again

341
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:03,880
You have no vigor and you've ruined the scaling whatever what's the shit? Oh, what's that?

342
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,269

Okay, two butterflies

00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:39,799
I got talisman. Oh nice, dude. I got something cool

349
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,009
Isn't it funny that the one thing I did find I was going to give to you the long sword

350
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,500
He's gonna play easy mode

351
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,970
Hey

352
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,970
When you take you take it if you can get it, right?

353
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:12,010
I'm sorry, but if I get like one of the late game remembrances in the first five seconds, i'm gonna do it

354
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,909
Hands off. What the fuck?

355
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:19,289
We don't have a lantern by the way. Yeah, I know

356
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:29,210
Well, i'm ready. Did you get this item? What do you actually want to do magic because I just got stuff

357
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,300
I could do magic

358
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,900
I I don't want you to drop it for me

359
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,619
I I would love to get to the end of the game and like you're

360
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:44,940
In full golden armor and I still haven't gotten like a shirt like we can we can handle all your fat rolling. Whatever it is

361
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:53,099
Unstoppable. Oh, it's cracked. All right. So what this is the first little mini boss, right?

362
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:56,679
Yeah, okay

363
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,920
All right. Oh, it's actually this actually is actually really bad

364
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:11,309
Is that uh, it's actually kind of an inappropriate room

365
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:22,880
I gotta remember how this how this fight works. I hope you deal damage because I don't

366
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:43,920
You're doing fine. All right, back it up back it up ugly. Look at me. I tried to pull it didn't work

367
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:06,570
I don't think we're gonna do this

368
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,369
I he one shot me he dead. It looked like he was attacking you and he spun all the way around

369
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
All right, are you spectating me?

370
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,519
Yeah, you got this dude. You're unbeatable

371
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:37,010
I've heard you're unbeatable find out what I dodged it

372
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:52,530
I feel like you're you're actually doing less damage than I was I am because you haven't gotten a weapon

373
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,650
Oh

374
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,650
Fuck fuck

375
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,670
Fuck

376
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,550
I thought he was me strong, but he was me weak

377
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:30,079
Okay, so what's happening? My somebody said I fucked up the whole my whole character. Do you think we can do it?

378
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,659
I think we can do it

379
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:39,860
Uh, it's it's doable. It's a little rough for me because I i'm level three and I have no vigor or armor

380
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,860
Let's go we can do it. Okay

381
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,300
One more try one more try

382
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:56,800
Let's just run downstairs because these items are gonna be the same. Oh, that's right

383
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,579
Well, actually if we kill if we kill people they might be different, right?

384
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,860
All right, this idiot is over here. I'm just going down. Yes, technically if they drop different stuff

385
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,929
All right, i'm going in

386
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:12,929
What technicality? Okay, i'm coming

387
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:20,380
You doomed him by over leveling oh because the creature is scaling to you wait why

388
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:26,619
Because because the random enemies do scale. I don't know. I don't know your chat. I think they might just be saying words

389
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,860
I don't think your character's bricked

390
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,059
um

391
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,019
I think you're doing great. Okay. Well just you've

392
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,340
Let's go

393
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,219
Hey guys

394
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:42,300
Let's game. Yes. That's what i'm saying

395
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,340
Being extra careful

396
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:55,599
Because he might just fucking 180 degree spin and aggro at me

397
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:01,340
I'm cutting off his tail, dude

398
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,860
Oh

399
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:08,059
Oh shit

400
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,059
Oh, come on really doing a row. Yeah

401
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,489
Yo, he he's just spamming that move. He's new with this

402
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:25,969
He's just spamming

403
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:27,409
Uh-oh

404
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:31,409
Like that lingering hitbox cheater cheater spammer

405
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:39,389
Are you gonna do the crawl again?

406
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:44,989
Don't get too greedy you just got so greedy and it's making me I try I know I've mistimed my dodge. I'm sorry

407
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,800
What what did he swing at?

408
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,119
I don't know. The room is very small for this character

409
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,829
I'm distracting right now. You just get the hits in

410
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,789
I'm telling you he's looking at you and I think he's attacking you and he does a full spin on me

411
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:09,070
All right. Well, hold on. Let's see if I can do this. I can't take like one hit

412
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:28,900
My mimic tears got this

413
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,119
I dodged that's what i'm saying

414
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,570
Actually, I remember there being like an actual delay on dodge rolls in this game

415
00:40:52,860 --> 00:41:47,579
No, that's not the problem, madam

416
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,099
He's won. He's won

417
00:41:49,099 --> 00:42:24,210
Does this boss have two phases? I hope not a different one

418
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,110
Oh, he pulled. Okay

419
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,659
fucking

420
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:35,940
No, I got I got so screwed there. He did the fire thing in a bit too many times. I I had it I had it

421
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,650
Like what can we go get some items?

422
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,170
Yeah

423
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:48,909
A little bit. I had it too. Okay. I'm following you

424
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,550
All right, let's get let's do

425
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:56,940
Get on the horse

426
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,860
And let's get to

427
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,539
Let's go clear

428
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:03,550
What the fuck was that? All right

429
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,710
So we need to get out of here. Let's move like over here. Let's just go down here clear this out

Watch out. Yeah, watch out. Watch out. We got

435
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:38,369
Yeah, I know so funny. This is literally my least favorite item in any from software games. It's like this this frost

436
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:44,829
But I don't know what happened to my body. My mind just went somewhere. I don't know what i'm i'm

437
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:49,219
What happened to my mind dead body? Oh shit

438
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,000
He's in the game dude don't die dude don't die i'll take the hits

439
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:03,579
I'm shooting at me. All right, we have to pull this thing out. Let's pull this guy out

440
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,269
You're gonna die

441
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,269
I got him. Oh nice

442
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:19,179
All right, hopefully you get something out of this

443
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:20,940
Why is there like another guy here?

444
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,420
But she fell off the I killed the wolf but not the girl. Is this an npc? Oh, no, no. Okay

445
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:29,019
I got some thin beast bones

446
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,570
Yep. All right, let's go downstairs. This is gonna be a big item

447
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:38,849
I hope for your sake. I hope for my sake too

448
00:44:39,489 --> 00:44:50,400
I'll just leave them. What are you doing? I'm trying to do backstab

449
00:44:53,380 --> 00:45:00,829
That's what we should be doing man. We should be trading off backstabs. I can't really backstab the wolf

450
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:10,210
All right, let's see

451
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,719
I'm gonna let you open it because I feel like you deserve it

452
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,250
Golden lune

453
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:25,730
Wet stone knife. What is that? Yeah, that's for uh, that was for the upgrading your weapons. You need the

454
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:30,820
I think that's always there

455
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:33,380
What did you get a golden moon?

456
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:36,659
three eight hundred soul point

457
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,219
important v

458
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:40,909
I mean v

459
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:43,789
Vv important v important. What's vv?

460
00:45:44,429 --> 00:45:50,219
Vv important. What are you talking? Who is saying this to you? Somebody said vv important and they tagged me

461
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:56,880
Okay. Well, let's get the chest in the back here. I don't know if you want to fight the godskin noble

462
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,760
He's probably not that tough. I feel like the godskin noble would be harder than the worm

463
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:13,010
Yeah, he should be scaled as a normal enemy hp not boss hp. Oh, okay smithing. So I have a lot of smithing stones

464
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:29,460
Yeah, just do all right. Let's see if it's let's see if it's scaled. Uh, no

465
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:34,719
It is not

466
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:36,260
Okay

467
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:40,420
Well, we're already doing it. So you want to just run get them. I actually think we can get them

468
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
Okay, well, I don't have any healing left

469
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:45,070
Oh

470
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,150
And if you can still I think we can get them you think so?

471
00:46:47,869 --> 00:47:14,610
Yeah, i'm dead. I'm not

472
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:20,610
This is this would actually be ridiculously easy if one of us did have magic to just stand around and be the asshole

473
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:24,849
That throws magic at him god. Oh, oh good luck. You're

474
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,570
There's no hope for you. I'm alive

475
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:37,760
It didn't kill me. I'm alive level fucking 25. Oh god. Damn it. Don't

476
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,079
Thrust weapons, I hate these things. Yeah, i'll give you i'll give you the anchor

477
00:47:55,969 --> 00:48:01,900
No, I'll wait

478
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,219
I can't I can't reach him and you got you

479
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:10,559
wrought essence

480
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,670
hopelessness

481
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,960
Wait, why did I get that?

482
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:26,030
Wait, what's going on? Sometimes an enemy might fall off the map or something. Maybe you just I don't know i'm dead shit

483
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,219
My actual souls that I need to be one tenth the level of you

484
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:39,119
Oh, I also did get an item for dying wrought essence. Wait, this this thing reduces your mind. Can I delete this?

485
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:51,599
Reduces maximum health it's part of the mod sit at a grace to delete it

486
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:01,059
What? Yeah, I got a weird item that what's the point if it resets because if you die you're out of grace

487
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:07,940
Oh, I don't understand bird. It's balancing for seamless co-op

488
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,380
Oh, I can I get it. So if you die

489
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,190
And I try to come back to help you

490
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,389
And it reduces your to make us so we can't just like jeez stuff

491
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:24,829
I see well, I don't think we should do that. Anyway, no, we're gonna try to do this as legit as we can

492
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,710
Okay, I want to go grab my uh

493
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,300
My runes

494
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,780
And then we can go and go anywhere just pick a direction and we're going to go off into the sunset

495
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:38,099
All right. Well the logical direction is to go just towards um

496
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:44,980
Margot yeah market search of the elden ring

497
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:52,960
Why is that logical because that's the first area to go to is it though? Yeah

498
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,139
What about the castle to the south? I mean we could

499
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,920
Yeah, we could do that

500
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,360
Okay

501
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,190
Is that illogical?

502
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:08,510
I'm just trying to remember the thing you just said of hey, where are we going is you should pick where we go

503
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,630
And then now you're like trying to make me decide somewhere else. Let's tell me where let's go. I'm following you

504
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:17,070
Okay, you are the commander. I am your

505
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,889
hairy

506
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:27,739
Companion. All right. Um, let's go. Let's go. We'll go so are you sure about that?

507
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:30,219
You didn't want to go to a market

508
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:33,659
No, I don't think I actually don't think we're ready for that if that's another hard boss before I can't do it

509
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:43,090
I'll make sure you get this

510
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,460
Oh, I see what what's going on?

511
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,579
I mean is that when you act when you touch the bonfire to get it

512
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,159
I auto sit at it because you've already touched it. So I think you getting the bonfire gets it for both of us

513
00:50:55,409 --> 00:51:00,929
Oh, I just realized that I they I get what people mean now by how I just ruined everything for my character by just

514
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:06,659
Spamming everything to strength. Um, I need 3200 runes to level up now and that's not going to happen for like an hour

515
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:14,909
I see

516
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:17,539
NPC. Oh, it's the

517
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:20,219
the

518
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:30,190
Clothing guy. What's his name walk or something? Where is he? He's right here golden rune eight

519
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:34,239
I've got a pretty fat level up there

520
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:44,300
I I don't think I ever helped this guy or came here and got him one time ever

521
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:54,420
Really? He's cool. He's got a cool story. Let me guess how his story ends. How do you think it ends?

522
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:57,619
Oh, well, it's an elden ring npc he dies

523
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:10,030
Oh, wait, he just gave me something sick. Wait, what he gave me throwing daggers

524
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:20,019
Uh this npc spoiler alert for those that didn't play. Um, he does not die if you you know, he can die

525
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
right like every npc can but

526
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:27,340
There's there's a scenario where he doesn't well

527
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:34,619
Let's cut his head off because instead of a like a ball bearing he'll drop something else a bell a bell ball

528
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:38,139
I think that in elden ring there's very few things that I mean

529
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:43,550
This is like the npc that you do not hurt out of all of them. You sure about that? I am like

530
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:50,269
As a general elden ring community, I think this guy is protected forever. Like you don't hurt this guy ever, right?

531
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:58,699
Okay, where are we going boss? All right

532
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,820
Okay, I just was making sure you understood that before you uh, i'm not hurting him. I he's i'm not doing anything

533
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,119
Don't kill him. Please we we can go do his quest if you want

534
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,360
You never did any of this do what did you just like run through the game as fast as you could?

535
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:21,860
He's the guy that gives you the needle right? Yeah, the sewing needle. Yeah. No, I just I think I just

536
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:32,030
Happen to miss him. If I break this do you get why does this guy have so much health?

537
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:35,969
Are you gonna you get that?

538
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:42,929
Yeah, okay, because this is a misbegotten and he's pretty late game

539
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,510
Not really

540
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,469
Late-ish right? Isn't this this is the farmazula people, isn't it?

541
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:51,739
uh

542
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:53,739
No, I thought this was the castle more

543
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:56,699
Misbegotten but they might be in both areas

544
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:03,440
Huh? No, this is early game drop a staff you coward

545
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:09,659
He's more castle

546
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:20,619
Uh beast blood. Oh, I thought that was millennia. It's like a shit

547
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:27,039
That enemy does suck though. It I they're one of my like least favorite enemies

548
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:34,739
Well one on one if you beat this enemy first try i'll give you 100. By the way, you can't take any damage

549
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:38,019
Why you just add shit as I run in?

550
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,019
I I can't even get near the guy. I'll take it

551
00:54:56,449 --> 00:54:58,449
Oh sneaky. All right, i'll do it now

552
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,900
Oh now now i'll do it

553
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:19,070
I've got the rot

554
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,280
and now

555
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:32,590
Rot i'm actually scarlet rotting and dying. I need to get to a bonfire. Yeah, this item might be something good

556
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:37,980
I'm dying dude, dude. I'm dying

557
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:43,539
Dude, i'm dying. Well, just go just go to a bonfire. Um, I can hang out dude. I'm dying

558
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:50,320
All right, I don't think i'm gonna make it dude. I'm dying dude. I'm not gonna teleport to the bonfire. Why are you running?

559
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,500
Ah, i'm roleplaying

560
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:55,329
you

561
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:59,070
Idiot does that mean what happens now?

562
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,079
Do I have to die too? No, I think I can just rest you rest and then come back. Okay

563
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:17,650
Oh, yeah, you did around you. Yeah, you did. Okay. I think it's different though. Maybe not. Oh, no. No. Whoa, I didn't

564
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:22,449
Okay, that was weird

565
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:24,449
That guy shouldn't respawn though because he's

566
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,130
Whatever it is

567
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:33,539
Whatever you did. I see you going around but you're not on a horse. Okay, let's just run by these guys

568
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,940
Oh, this is like a crab this reminds me of like the dark souls, too

569
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:41,219
Uh, but when they recreate what was it called scholar of the first sin?

570
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:47,460
Yeah, like I guess we'll put a crab and um, one of those casters. It doesn't just call it the first sin

571
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:58,909
Yeah, you're riding around on nothing too

572
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,630
That looks so scary. It looks like a horror movie

573
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:11,739
What is going on over there? What's happening over here?

574
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:20,820
Is this kind of lagging giant fighting somebody or is he trying to fight us? I think he's trying to fight us but can't get out

575
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,940
There's like giant bugs in here

576
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:39,119
Okay, I think that's a bad idea. So we shouldn't go that way unless you think we can cheese this

577
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:45,789
I don't think we can I think he's cheesing us by being in there

578
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:49,309
Yeah, he's yeah, this is a strategy

579
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:54,849
There is the basement down here as well

580
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:01,869
What about the loot? All right, get the loot golden. Oh shit. I got good shit. I got good shit

581
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:05,630
I got some real good. I got grumble gauntlets. What is the grumble gauntlet? All right

582
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:08,989
grumble

583
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:13,789
Grumble gauntlets is what it was. All right coming down. I'm down here. This is a boss. This is a boss down here though

584
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:20,500
I don't know where you went. He's still chasing me. Did you go down the hole? I went down the hole. Yeah

585
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,820
Oh i'm coming. We can definitely cheese this by the way. There's no way you can fit down here

586
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:40,030
Go in the hole. Hold on. I need a second. I I found like some high level runes and uh a good sword

587
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:42,349
I got the fuck golden epitaph

588
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,590
Was this one of the ones that shoots like magic?

589
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:50,480
Or this was the holy one

590
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,840
Oh crucible gauntlets. I thought it said I don't know why it looked like grumble like crumble a grumble. All right, you ready?

591
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:02,369
Uh, oh, I don't want to lose my souls here, but okay. I believe in us. There's no way we're losing

592
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:04,219
Just don't even come in then

593
00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:10,619
I'm coming in. It's a mad soldier dude. We're fine. It's crazy. He's fucking gone nuts. He's gone bad

594
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,380
All right, good. So what is in here?

595
00:59:22,179 --> 00:59:24,179
That guy was that guy was fucked up

596
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:35,840
That's not bad runes

597
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,809
Oh, that's right

598
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:40,210
Uh, they sell stuff though, right? Because their shop will be random

599
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:49,019
I have the lowest amount of intelligence. Yeah, we have the lowest amount of intelligence you could possibly have in the game

600
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,260
Can you even talk to her?

601
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,230
Yeah

602
00:59:55,389 --> 01:00:00,929
Okay, uh, there's still sorceries, but are these different?

603
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:03,679
I feel like these are the same

604
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:05,679
Nah, she's selling garbage for me

605
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:10,610
Here i'm about to level up

606
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:17,940
But actually might be able to do it. All right, so uh chat help me out here somebody was saying

607
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,300
I can't believe you did that. So how do I fix this points and decks, right?

608
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,719
Uh, the glintstone blades are intelligence scaling stuff, right?

609
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,760
I don't want to do like full-on caster and cheese enemies, but I I could go like glintstone blade

610
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:40,829
and all that stuff

611
01:00:40,829 --> 01:00:42,110
yeah

612
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:51,539
Yeah, glintstone is uh is intelligent. Just do health

613
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,800
Only until you figure it out

614
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,440
I've vigor 17 intelligence 16. I mean I have 32 strength. So I just have to figure out the hell i'm doing

615
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:09,469
Dude, you are clapped for the rest of the game. We can find the uh, the respect things

616
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:15,039
I think I have to live with this

617
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,039
I just kind of got excited

618
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:23,739
And just put every point in it. I think we're out. Look that was that was fun. We're good

619
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:31,900
Actually, a faith could be fun and I already found the weapon like a faith weapon. Hmm

620
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,940
Oh god

621
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,179
Why is this aggro range so huge?

622
01:01:38,179 --> 01:01:42,019
I want to see this convoy and all of the random enemies in it walking together

623
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:45,699
I want to see the fucking parade of every enemy in elden ring. That's true

624
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,550
Uh, he's still behind us. I don't

625
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,570
Yep

626
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:56,929
What is this?

627
01:01:56,929 --> 01:01:58,929
Um a lobster

628
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,280
Wait, what is that?

629
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,460
Why is it like a lobster tree?

630
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:07,980
I don't know. I'm not messing with a lobster. Yeah, we got way too much stuff following us

631
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:14,780
Imagine you get to the final fight and it's like you have to become an elden lord and you go into the arena and it's a lobster

632
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,420
That would be awesome. No one would have ever beat this game

633
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,230
Huge hand huge hand and it's very fast

634
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:30,000
Look at how fast that is anime in the game. No. Oh my god. We are disagree so much. I hate those things

635
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,159
Those things are stupid like design wise the type of enemy that they are

636
01:02:35,409 --> 01:02:37,789
I like the hand

637
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:40,989
All right, but design resting design wise

638
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:45,949
Playing against it like actually the actual mechanics the thing has fighting it. Not great

639
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:50,460
Okay, just saying if you're gonna be like, oh, I love it

640
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:53,739
No, I love like it punching me

641
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:57,019
Turning into a fist and like ramming me wherever I am

642
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:05,469
I didn't over here. Okay, i'm following you smithing stone. All right, so let's take a look

643
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:12,590
We're trying to get to this tower over here. So let's just keep going. I wonder those boss, um the jails

644
01:03:13,469 --> 01:03:16,510
We should try to do those. Um, but we could get some we get some pretty lucky shit here

645
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:20,929
Maybe all right. This is just a vr chat lobby

646
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:23,650
Like this is not

647
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:26,130
Elevator. Oh shit. All right, go go go keep going

648
01:03:29,489 --> 01:03:32,369
Plus two

649
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:33,730
Where are you?

650
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:37,460
I'm behind you

651
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,420
Somebody said they I think that's alexander. Is it really?

652
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,030
What? Hey

653
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:47,329
Stop don't do that

654
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:53,570
I killed the dog

655
01:03:53,570 --> 01:04:03,039
With the holy blade of the emperor. All right, so let's see what's in here

656
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:19,469
Who knows dude, it might be mad soldier too. I hope it's mad soldier. All right be on your toes could be anyone. Oh up here

657
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:24,179
What is it?

658
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:26,179
It's just a regular ass guy

659
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,420
No, this guy is one of the most fucked up people

660
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,969
And I got insta comboed

661
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:34,130
Because when he jumps up you get like sunlocked

662
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:40,179
Should I try should I try to fight him?

663
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,739
Yeah, what are you gonna do? What else are you gonna do?

664
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,010
I don't think he's got that much health, but this enemy sucks

665
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:10,699
Shit. Oh, I think he just looks weird because the npcs have random items

666
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,239
I fucking hate i'm gonna go bare hands. I'm gonna use my bare hands. I hate this thing so much

667
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:22,340
I hate frost items in all these games. I'm just using my bare hands. I I think

668
01:05:23,139 --> 01:05:32,750
A steak. Oh, oh, yeah, I can give you a weapon. I think I found some other stuff. You're that desperate. No, i'm just mad

669
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:38,099
Okay, he's just mad. I don't want to fight that guy. He doesn't have that much health. We can kill him

670
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:42,639
Let me see. Why are you playing this shit again?

671
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,719
What this is like one of the best games ever like made?

672
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,460
This game's fun what come on I think we can do it

673
01:05:54,739 --> 01:05:56,420
Okay. Yeah, I wasn't ready

674
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:05,739
He caught me off guard. I wasn't ready. Make sure you get your souls

675
01:06:07,539 --> 01:06:10,739
You had me. All right. Don't just go right up. He's gonna do the thing. He's gonna kill you in one hit

676
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:20,269
It's just just there you go. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. He's gonna turn to you. I'm gonna do the same thing

677
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:33,309
Get him turn around you got this guy

678
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,219
This is so unfair

679
01:06:40,219 --> 01:06:44,659
back on the ground

680
01:06:44,659 --> 01:06:45,780
Uh-oh

681
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,780
Uh-oh, he did a weird move

682
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:53,219
I feel like we invaded some poor player

683
01:06:53,619 --> 01:06:55,619
Just like and we're just fucking with him

684
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,119
He keeps trying to do that same move

685
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,119
You can't cast spells man. We're in your face

686
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:15,869
He's just if I get it off if I just get it off both these motherfuckers are dead

687
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:24,980
Go up. Oh shit. I'm gonna die

688
01:07:29,139 --> 01:07:32,400
All right. We're good. We got him

689
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:33,840
Honestly

690
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,840
He got outplayed. Yeah, he did

691
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,269
royal house scroll

692
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:42,269
Oh, come on a scroll

693
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,059
I got a fireproof liver

694
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:49,730
I forget what all that stuff even does I assume fire resistance i'm not gonna I don't want to cast spells

695
01:07:49,889 --> 01:07:54,619
Well, I gave souls. We're still leveling, you know early game. That's true

696
01:07:55,099 --> 01:08:04,110
All right, so we did that let's mark it on the map so we don't forget

697
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:11,969
I'm gonna say uh, the sword is it was completed

698
01:08:12,449 --> 01:08:20,060
Okay, do you see that or do you have to do it on your own? I don't see it

699
01:08:20,539 --> 01:08:29,520
All right, we're gonna trust you. You're the wayfinder. Okay, we can keep going down and you want to just keep going down across the bridge

700
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,020
i'm following you

701
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:36,109
Yeah, but i'm gonna be going like roleplay speed on my horse

702
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,270
We can do roleplay speed

703
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:48,000
That's fine. I'm gonna follow you. Yeah. All right. He's getting back to the road

704
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:58,180
Kind of looks like you're kind of looks like you're speeding up there. This is this is what you would be going if you were

705
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,100
When i'm not going full blast

706
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:12,430
I don't know about that

707
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:20,239
Let's cross the bridge. Oh, hold on item up here. Ooh

708
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:28,140
Oh, it looked like a purple item from way back there

709
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:32,619
fire grease

710
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:45,039
smithing stone

711
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:47,039
I hope the next item you find is a spear

712
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,869
Sorry, but yeah, that'd be kind of that would be humorous. It'd be comical

713
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:55,390
All right. Let's go. Yeah, i'm on team comedy

714
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,109
Yeah, I mean if you're playing randomizer

715
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,750
You kind of have to be on team comedy

716
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:04,449
Uh item here. Ooh

717
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:10,539
What is that thing?

718
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:15,920
That thing is this thing is like one of the best items in the whole game. I think isn't it dragon crest shield talisman plus two

719
01:10:17,789 --> 01:10:21,949
That's pretty good nice

720
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,420
Yeah, I haven't found a article of clothing

721
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,779
No, you haven't

722
01:10:28,779 --> 01:10:30,140
Are we going down?

723
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:35,699
I was gonna go across the bridge

724
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:41,859
This death drop here or no. Yeah, if you jump down through the wind you won't take damage. Oh, it's all right

725
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:45,760
You're good. All right, let's go the wind

726
01:10:47,899 --> 01:10:50,380
Uh, oh that dragonfly ant

727
01:10:51,329 --> 01:10:53,569
Is arming the ballista?

728
01:10:53,569 --> 01:10:55,569
Wait, is it really?

729
01:10:55,890 --> 01:11:01,489
Oh, I thought it was I got a spell I got gravity well, it was a bug well manning the ballista

730
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:09,489
E d. Yeah, what the fuck? Oh one of oh god. I'm sorry for aggroing you. Okay, good

731
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:16,640
Okay, it was one of the like the bomb birds. These enemies are lazy

732
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:23,779
I think they just have a line of sight that we're just breaking. What is on this? What is on her head? What is this?

733
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:29,680
Oh, okay. I thought I was like why is what's like on her head? You can't say that

734
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:41,140
I thought it was like I think I thought she was a different character actually does look like she's wearing like a flower pot

735
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:47,939
Uh, should we kill her to save the trouble of someone else having to do it?

736
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:55,199
Um, i'm not gonna make any decisions on npc killings looks like you already did

737
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:06,590
You basically you decide it by not deciding. I hope she kills you doesn't deal damage though

738
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:16,239
I'm not your father. I got I got a helmet it was worth it. I got her helmet

739
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,880
She dropped it. I got a mask

740
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:24,050
finally

741
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:30,510
Cool. It is I sir knight. Somebody said fuck you, sir

742
01:12:38,189 --> 01:12:43,229
Jerma just watched I can't hit you. I can't stop you. There's no friendly fire

743
01:12:43,949 --> 01:12:45,949
Yeah, but you didn't tell me to stop. Um

744
01:12:46,689 --> 01:12:49,680
item

745
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:54,159
Yep, that would have been a laugh out loud comedy moment, but I I had to get away from it

746
01:12:54,720 --> 01:13:01,229
Isn't there an item here? There is oh

747
01:13:02,989 --> 01:13:05,470
Oh, it's over though. I there's no we don't lose no

748
01:13:06,189 --> 01:13:12,930
I literally just got rivers of blood right now noise

749
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,060
Uh nice, uh, like, uh, I don't I just I just got teach

750
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:25,149
Are you fighting everything? I just ran up ahead. No, so I think something died

751
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:33,470
Yeah, but I can't you

752
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:37,949
I can't use rivers of blood right? That's like that's lame. Isn't it? You can use whatever you want

753
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:40,960
but

754
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,760
I mean like I physically can't because I have 32 points in strength because I freaked out and pressed the button

755
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,899
Yeah, I don't think you can

756
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:54,460
All right. So down here we need to find wisdom map fragment down here

757
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:07,789
I've got the academy key. This guy's selling the academy key

758
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:11,069
So i'm gonna buy that

Haven't enough to level up. Oh shit, and he's got smithing stone ones, which is very good

760
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:27,180
When I finally get an item, so should I put any points? I feel like I need to put points in dexterity

761
01:14:27,579 --> 01:14:42,590
What if I what did I do? No only vigor. Okay. All right, do not level decks

762
01:14:43,329 --> 01:14:45,010
under any circumstance

763
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:49,329

767
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:19,779
And I got the academy glint stone so we can actually go do the thing where you can respect if you absolutely needed to we can

768
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:21,859
Go to lucaria

769
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:26,029
I think it'll be all right as long as I get like a big super heavy weapon soon. I'll be fine

770
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:33,039
Okay, let's uh, i'm gonna rest did you add a charge to your flask in the very beginning?

771
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:39,170
No, well, I would do it because you picked golden seed didn't you I didn't I picked uh

772
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,180
Stone key, why would you pick stone key over golden seed?

773
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:53,279
Uh, just to make you mad to anger you and you feel the wall between your brain and your skull

774
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:04,260
No, oh you thought I was asking you that no, I was reading that out loud. I know but i'm still confused

775
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:17,199
No matter no matter where that sentence came from. It's confusing. Yeah, it is isn't it so much shit

776
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:24,539
I'm like, it's so overwhelming when you there's so many things to see did I not? Yeah, I did. Okay. I'm ready

777
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:31,100
I'm gonna start rp'ing. Oh wait. Yeah. No, no, let's wait till night time

778
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:42,989
For the cavalry. I'm curious. I assume you like just can do it and it overrides my game find out

779
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:47,920
Until nightfall hit it

780
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:58,340
Uh, I don't think it did it. I don't think it did it. I'm the host. Maybe I gotta do it

781
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:03,380
Uh, you also sit down while i'm doing it. I don't know i'm sitting

782
01:17:05,869 --> 01:17:14,750
Uh that seemed to have worked. Yeah, uh chat my chat says host can do it. All right, so where's the night cavalry?

783
01:17:14,989 --> 01:17:23,539
Well, doesn't this area so I have one of those birds that jumps down at night. I think it does

784
01:17:23,699 --> 01:17:30,189
Oh, wait, it's just it's just the night cavalry. Okay

785
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:37,119
Did this get rolled into just being the regular enemy that's supposed to be here different night cavalry?

786
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:52,510
I don't know like i'm not doing damage

787
01:17:53,899 --> 01:18:00,159
Seems to be very tough. Oh, you're not on your horse

788
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:16,939
I'm like not hurting him. He's also really I

789
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:32,430
We're all right. I think you're hitting his horse

790
01:18:41,949 --> 01:18:43,949
Yeah, we're you're hurting his horse. Definitely

791
01:18:49,380 --> 01:19:15,729
Ouch, ah that lock on game. So, uh, do you want to leave so bad?

792
01:19:17,329 --> 01:19:21,489
Battles, huh? I was just thinking like I don't know if there is an elden ring to the horse battles

793
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:29,659
Sticking with this. I mean we kind of we're here and we're already hurting him

794
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,239
All right, we'll just get off the horses then and let's fight him one on one two v two

795
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:43,390
Dude, my camera keeps unlocking him and it's it's rough

796
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:20,770
Ow, ow am I dead? I think you're okay. I just hit the jump button instead

797
01:20:21,409 --> 01:20:31,859
Where is he going? I don't know. He's running. Uh-huh

798
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:41,680
I remember the first time I fought one of these and you like feel so proud you get him off the horse and he

799
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:43,920
Instantly just summons the horse again. Yeah

800
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,460
Dude, I want to target him not the horse

801
01:20:49,340 --> 01:21:04,619
Why can I not target him?

802
01:21:04,779 --> 01:21:08,579
All right, have you given up?

803
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:13,779
I don't want to say yes because I know you're gonna be like see I I wanted to give up a while ago

804
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:18,659
There's no see there's like a there's a let's go. All right, get on your horse and let's get out of here

805
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:25,199
Jeremy you have to hit him until he dies

806
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:26,399
I

807
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:27,680
I don't

808
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:34,579
I don't think you he's still behind us

809
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:48,779
Make sure you get the map fragment. It's my second ancient dragon smithing stone

810
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:53,569
There's a bug with the mod. If you fight on horseback, the lock-on will stop working. Oh

811
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:57,010
That is what's happening to me. I was wondering why it was so weird

812
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,380
All right, where are you heading?

813
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:10,880
I don't know. I was just looking around. I like forgot. There was this whole beach over here because I think there's nothing on it

814
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:15,680
Let's go to the beach

815
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,680
When are you gonna do a screaming stream?

816
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:20,239
I did one like a year or two ago

817
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:23,359
I just turned the uh the stream on I just sit there and I just go like

818
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:27,979
And and like it's the stream's only like

819
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,460
15 minutes that I can't really do for that long

820
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,659
You just screamed

821
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:39,340
Yeah, I just kind of scream and then to get a breather take a sip of water scream again

822
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,420
And then it's like my throat kind of hurts. I have to stop

823
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:46,300
That's cool. I like that

824
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:49,619
What is the it's like this headless person?

825
01:23:01,149 --> 01:23:03,949
Oh, there's something really good here. I don't know what it is, but I hope it's

826
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:09,859
I'm glad we came down here

827
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:16,590
Great ghost glove ward. That's the highest love ward in the game. Isn't it? I don't know. Yeah it is

828
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:27,970
Okay

829
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:30,369
That was cool. Now, let's let's check out this area

830
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:34,880
with a swamp

831
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,840
What that call wait? I was expecting the giant to be shooting the crossbows out of us, but he's like

832
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:53,229
a bumblebee

833
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:59,069
Dude, I don't know what happened or what's wrong, but my pants and underwear are like stuck adhered to my legs and ass

834
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:02,989
I don't know. This is weird. I don't understand why oh to have clothing

835
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,289
First world problems there buddy

836
01:24:06,289 --> 01:24:11,090
This has never happened before. I don't know why this is happening. This is weird. Oh in real life

837
01:24:11,569 --> 01:24:16,340
What did you think of your pants? I thought I don't know your clothes are sticking to you

838
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:18,930
It's not even that hot

839
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:22,850
Have you worn have you like I don't know. Did you bathe in something sticky?

840
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:34,220
Did you do like an applesauce bath? Isn't there like a place to jump off in the middle or is that a different place?

841
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:43,359
Uh in dark souls 2

842
01:24:43,359 --> 01:25:12,189
Uh, there is a giant up there that you have a cool item. That's a cool item

843
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:15,359
Yeah, I got the

844
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:17,439

845
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,939
I got a

846
01:25:23,939 --> 01:25:27,100
blade's head

847
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:30,819
Okay, what do you want to do here?

848
01:25:30,819 --> 01:25:31,859
um

849
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:33,859
I can't believe you're still with the spear

850
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:36,210
I know

851
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:38,930
Let's just let's just aggro believe throw shit

852
01:25:44,029 --> 01:25:46,029
These enemies actually kind of suck

853
01:25:46,029 --> 01:25:48,340
I don't know. There's a couple dogs

854
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:51,340

855
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:56,670
Cat dog

856
01:25:56,670 --> 01:26:02,579
I I thought I couldn't target it for a second scarlet rot scarlet super i'm scared of dog

857
01:26:04,689 --> 01:26:08,050
Go out on the road or back in the town all because I could have put in cat dog down

858
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:20,539
You good guys

859
01:26:20,699 --> 01:26:35,229
All right, you're back good wonder if there's any good loot in here. Oh, yeah, I am

860
01:26:38,189 --> 01:26:41,229
Any secrets in here? Oh, I got leggings

861
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:43,069
Wait

862
01:26:43,069 --> 01:26:45,949
I don't want to wear pants. Oh, well, I want to wear leggings

863
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:48,619
Oh, I got the gross

864
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:51,489
Messer, what is this?

01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:53,489
Gross messer. Can I use this?

866
01:26:53,569 --> 01:26:56,699
How can I not put this on?

867
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,310
Why can I not use this?

868
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:05,310
I can't even equip this in two hands

869
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:18,420
Oh my god, give me a break. Why are things up? That thing's a gross messer

870
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:25,489
Who handing only works for strength?

871
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:34,050
Did you do that?

872
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:39,250
Yeah, your character's got so much cooler than mine in like 15 minutes. I have I got one sword

873
01:27:39,489 --> 01:27:44,050
Yeah, and it's uh, that's the bug weapon. That's the one of the coolest swords. I was I was about to use that in my um

874
01:27:44,609 --> 01:27:46,270
first playthrough

875
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:53,149
He's jealous

876
01:27:53,149 --> 01:27:56,510
Fucking level 30 character over here. Ooh, look at this

877
01:27:58,130 --> 01:28:00,130
Just mad. He put it all into strength

878
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:05,229
I got a bow

879
01:28:05,229 --> 01:28:10,289
Is there a boss in here? There is isn't there?

880
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:14,699
I don't think I don't even remember ever coming up this way. This is um

881
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:20,449
Isn't don't know that there's a guy at the top right? He's like me. I am the leader of this place

882
01:28:20,449 --> 01:28:27,890
Have you seen my daughter? I got a knight rider glaive. I got a glass you want another thrusting weapon

883
01:28:41,539 --> 01:28:43,300
That guy didn't even move

884
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:46,140
He was in prison

885
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:50,270
It's got yeah

886
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:51,470
I in all of my playthroughs

887
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:54,829
I never came up here and was always wondering where this guy was and I always missed this

888
01:28:55,390 --> 01:29:00,270
You didn't ever come over here. I don't know how there's just it's a big game and some things you miss

889
01:29:02,829 --> 01:29:07,199
You know that gives me so much confidence that this game really is as good as it is because

890
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:13,619
You saying that how many times did you play through the game at least a few times, right?

891
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:18,500
A lot. Yeah, so a lot. That's really cool. The fact that you just haven't even seen this place

892
01:29:18,579 --> 01:29:21,779
Yeah, every time I did a new playthrough. I was like, I never saw this before

893
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:24,739
I missed this on my first one. Uh, we have uh

894
01:29:27,619 --> 01:29:34,130
Over there should be careful. I don't I don't like this situation. This actually is not good

895
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:38,420
Why did you aggro everything

896
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:43,149
What are you doing? Why did you ever the whole top? This is my fault

897
01:29:43,149 --> 01:29:46,989
They weren't already walking over to us. We do we could have killed a few of them

898
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,279
Oh my god. Thank goodness. I can fix this character

899
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:59,600
Oh my god, there are enemies stir must have done this

900
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:13,819
I think you can only hurt these guys with blunt weapons, by the way

901
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:18,739
Oh

902
01:30:18,739 --> 01:30:24,770
Uh, you can backstab her but yeah, you might need a blunt weapon

903
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:30,909
Um, we're gonna die here. We just need to go. Okay, follow me

904
01:30:35,659 --> 01:30:38,220
Where did you go? I don't follow me. Actually, it's better do

905
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:42,140
I followed you and i'm out of hell. No, no, no, no, because they're back. Oh, uh,

906
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:48,140
That's a gigantic centipede monster thing over there. Uh, this is bad. They're casting us

907
01:30:48,859 --> 01:30:50,859
They're casting us

908
01:30:55,739 --> 01:31:00,460
Oh my god, what the f don't go that way don't go that way this I got caught

909
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:09,619
I'm dead

910
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:17,409
Like I said, i've never been up there ever well, um stir there's not that's not what's up there

911
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:22,300
I know but like I don't even where we're going you ran into a dead end. You should know that's a dead end

912
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,300
You're a master of this game, right?

913
01:31:26,449 --> 01:31:32,619
Okay, we're just gonna get back up. Did you rest again to get rid of your whatever they gave you an idea

914
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:42,979
Fix your character. All right, hold on. I know i'm not gonna do that yet because I feel like it's gonna scale all the enemies

915
01:31:44,350 --> 01:31:47,310
How how would you fix it because I have a golden rune plus 10

916
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:51,310
And i'm about to level up like five ten more times. Oh, no, i'm pretty sure you can use that

917
01:31:51,949 --> 01:31:56,270
I think they're still leveled by the zone that they're in. I was I was saying dumb things before

918
01:31:57,899 --> 01:32:10,560
Oh, I thought this is way more than it is. There's a boss at this castle andy

919
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:21,140
Uh, yeah, we saw it. It was astel. I think because uh that was spamming at us. No, that's my sword

920
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:31,890
Why are you a dog?

921
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:37,380
I thought you hate it when people were wolves

922
01:32:37,859 --> 01:32:46,210
What? All right. Wait, wait, wait, we need to figure out where where's the progress route to get up to the top

923
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,960
You go to the other side of this and you go upright. Yeah, okay. All right, let's not not up the pile

924
01:32:51,039 --> 01:33:08,300
We can just let's kill these uh, somebody said that was so funny. Mine's too. Yeah, if I get poisoned i'm gonna be so mad

925
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,460
There's so much poison dust

926
01:33:14,829 --> 01:33:25,020
Did he heal?

927
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:32,319
Why is this guy not dying?

928
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:43,180
Yeah, then you can just run along the side ignore blob. That's funny. You got the sleeping rock there

929
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:48,270
This is normally a sleepy guy there

930
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:50,770
smithing stone

931
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:52,449
We're getting a lot of those

932
01:33:52,449 --> 01:33:58,140
Oh, it's a mog like enemy

933
01:34:00,109 --> 01:34:02,109
These guys are actually horrible. Aren't they?

934
01:34:02,739 --> 01:34:04,739
Oh, no, no. No, I know. I thought it was a bog like it's not

935
01:34:12,619 --> 01:34:14,989
Do I hate those guys too with the bow?

936
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:22,779
Well, they can shoot you from across the whole game, right? Those things. Yeah, they're so annoying. Don't look up

937
01:34:25,149 --> 01:34:29,550
Please be respectful. I I can't guys. What is he talking about eyes forward?

938
01:34:30,109 --> 01:34:33,710
I thought you meant that there was like a something very scary like a monster or something. No

939
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:37,789
It was my bare body that cannot find clothing

940
01:34:38,510 --> 01:34:43,539
All right. We need to be careful here because there is a gigantic giant up here

941
01:34:50,779 --> 01:34:52,979
Item up here too

942
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:59,630
That's so scary. I don't think we're going to be able to get to that part. Uh, they're kind of right in the way

943
01:35:00,189 --> 01:35:04,590
Oh, I didn't see the gigantic astle in the sky. You didn't see that. That's what was killed

944
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:06,670
That's what that's the first time i've noticed it

945
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:10,210
What?

946
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:12,689
It is shoot. Oh, yeah, that that's what I was saying

947
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:16,659
I think this is a run scenario

948
01:35:16,899 --> 01:35:19,220
Oh god

949
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:25,279
Okay, let's uh, let's pull aggro pull him back. Okay, we can kill this giant

950
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:42,560
Okay, this is a run angle. Yeah, this is a run now. Why are you why are we fighting this?

951
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,720
This is a run scenario. It always was

952
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,680
And you left me with the fucking guy with the battle act

953
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:52,539
There's a bar feeder on me

954
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:56,260
Is there i'm learning the names?

955
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:58,260
All right, hide hide for a second

956
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,880
This thing is invincible we're in so much trouble, uh, we gotta go down here, right?

957
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:10,020
Yeah. All right. Let's reset them

958
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:14,960
All right

959
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,399
Reset

960
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:20,819
Okay progress

961
01:36:20,819 --> 01:36:24,140
All right. Everything's good to go

962
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:30,539
Sounds good

963
01:36:30,539 --> 01:36:32,939
Where are you? I went down the rocks

964
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:38,590
Oh, yeah. Oh, there is a boss down at the beach right with the uh, yeah the misbegon

965
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,779
Whoops. I I really did that

966
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:48,189
I really did this I did this to myself and there's a fucking brutal enemy down there

967
01:36:50,579 --> 01:36:52,579
Uh, there is that there's a mogul like down here

968
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:56,850
This is a run angle. Uh, i'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna do it, right?

969
01:37:04,529 --> 01:37:05,890
That just happened

970
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:12,590
Where the hell are you?

971
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:15,979
Something in my nose. I went down. I did that I went the right way

972
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:19,329
Okay, well i'm further ahead

973
01:37:19,329 --> 01:37:21,569
The right way isn't this an npc bridge?

974
01:37:22,899 --> 01:37:25,939
Wait, how come I can't tell this isn't this isn't this the guy?

975
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,680
Run saved you got a larval tear

976
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:42,979
Oh god, okay. Wait

977
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:45,180
um

978
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:49,659
Where you're all the way down, right? I jumped off the side of the bridge to get on the roof

979
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:54,539
Uh

980
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:56,300
Oh, okay. You're right there

981
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,859
Um, I want to go up that ladder and get the item that's up there though

982
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:11,390
Okay, I already jumped down you can do that if you want i'll wait. I was in a bit of a panic

983
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,539
Oh goodness

984
01:38:15,539 --> 01:38:19,939
I'm rooting for you

985
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:39,539
Okay, I thought what he came whatever that ladder is pretty hard to get up do I laugh like a cartoon character

986
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,000
Do you laugh?

987
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,550
um

988
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:56,579
Sometimes uh, did you respawn? I did

989
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:59,460
Oh, you didn't want to spectate me

990
01:38:59,619 --> 01:39:03,380
No, why would I want to spectate you? I'm i'm coming because I could just go up here and get the bonfire up here

991
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:04,579
And then we could have

992
01:39:04,579 --> 01:39:12,289
I thought it was like an honor system where if one person dies

993
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,670
That my game just lagged for a second

994
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:34,130
Come on, you see you're all the way down, right? I'm resetting the enemies. Yeah

995
01:39:34,689 --> 01:39:53,939
That's a bear. What?

996
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:56,020
Why is it? Well, I thought wait, all right

997
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:59,939
Okay, I got a crustacean amulet or something

998
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:13,619
I don't think the bear can get out of this door. All right, this is an opportunity for us to kill this

999
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:27,039
I nuked him. Nice. That thing is so good. It really is. I should have used it in my playthrough

1000
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,119
Get off my friend

1001
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:33,119
This is his bear is in the way

1002
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:40,829
Are you ever gonna play elden ring?

1003
01:40:41,890 --> 01:40:49,260
um, no

1004
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:53,180
Absolutely not. I was thinking about it the other day during my scream, uh stream

1005
01:40:54,140 --> 01:40:55,970
I was sitting there going

1006
01:40:55,970 --> 01:40:57,970
What the fuck am I doing man? Like why am I doing this?

1007
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:01,170
I'm like trying so hard to be funny and shit and like I could just be playing elden ring

1008
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:07,470
Like I think I was like this eighth or ninth scream and i'm just like this is i'm trying way too hard

1009
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:09,869
Wait, did you really do a scream stream?

1010
01:41:10,909 --> 01:41:13,260
No

1011
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:15,899
You thought that was real something i'm missing here

1012
01:41:16,939 --> 01:41:21,460
Squad move up. All right, let's go

1013
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,720
dagger

1014
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:53,899
And a cookbook lame

1015
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:02,020
Do it like you fucking mean it

1016
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:18,579
That you ever go back here to the secret cave

1017
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,460
secret cave

1018
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:24,100
There's just I guess it's not really a cave but back here

1019
01:42:25,789 --> 01:42:30,909
Is there something back here? I think usually there's something there's something relevant back here like a weird sword or something

1020
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:33,069
really

1021
01:42:33,069 --> 01:42:34,109
Yeah

1022
01:42:34,109 --> 01:42:42,800
I don't think i've ever been back here

1023
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,399
like a

1024
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:45,600
million

1025
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,279
squid back here

1026
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:52,500
That's cool. I didn't get anything good, but cool

1027
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:57,010
All right. I got

1028
01:42:57,010 --> 01:43:07,920
Uh, I think i'm all right. This is the slowest enemy i've ever seen

1029
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:11,279
And you're waiting. Uh, yeah, but

1030
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:26,289
I hope the uh, the boat enemies summon like random

1031
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:29,170
dudes and not just the same skeletons

1032
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:37,279
I would imagine it's probably

1033
01:43:37,279 --> 01:43:38,720
Something different

1034
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:49,390
All right. What do you think we're gonna get in here?

1035
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:50,510
um

1036
01:43:50,510 --> 01:43:55,569
I think we're gonna get a uh

1037
01:43:56,899 --> 01:44:01,039
We call them by the way, I think that you upgrade your elixir with

1038
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,279
oh

1039
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:06,880
Crystal tears, I can't believe how fucking cool. This is right like I

1040
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,239
I wish this was just in the game normally

1041
01:44:11,649 --> 01:44:15,329
Yeah, this is so much better. This is a million times better

1042
01:44:16,909 --> 01:44:21,710
Did you ever play neo 2 and does anyone know if that actually even has multiplayer because i've been wanting to oh god

1043
01:44:21,949 --> 01:44:27,630
It's an actual boss

1044
01:44:27,630 --> 01:44:29,630
This is a bad place to fight this too

1045
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:32,170
37 damage. Oh no

1046
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:56,399
Shit wait, I might just walk off the edge. Is that possible?

1047
01:44:57,699 --> 01:44:59,149
um

1048
01:44:59,149 --> 01:45:05,539
I don't think so

1049
01:45:05,539 --> 01:45:07,859
We really deal no damage to every boss we fought

1050
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:14,000
Oh my god

1051
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,800
Of course, it's not going to go anywhere else. There's nowhere else for it to teleport to

1052
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:30,239
I even dodged too

1053
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:48,109
It's so awkward. All right, it's gonna spawn literally right here

1054
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:52,800
again one more

1055
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,079
um

1056
01:45:54,079 --> 01:45:56,079
That actually might be a strategy here

1057
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:00,609
It's way to put the teleport and whale on it. Yeah

1058
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:09,439
It would be so funny if it just fell in the ocean

1059
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,760
Oh

1060
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:20,000
Looks like it was possible

1061
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,800
There's so many look at all these fucking random animals

1062
01:46:28,369 --> 01:46:42,779
Jump on you. Oh my god, but oh, please don't kill me

1063
01:46:43,579 --> 01:46:45,949
I'm dead

1064
01:46:45,949 --> 01:46:59,470
This is uh, totally doable if you want to wait, uh an hour. I'm willing to wait as long as it takes me to do it

1065
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:25,489
Yeah, that's that's all right

1066
01:47:25,489 --> 01:47:28,850
Let him cook. I'm letting him he he has the whole kitchen to himself right now

1067
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:31,729
I really don't want to be in this kitchen for this long

1068
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:34,850
Like I should be getting paid overtime

1069
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:45,229
Yeah, but you'll have the achievement or you know on stream you beat this

1070
01:47:45,949 --> 01:47:50,350
alone

1071
01:47:50,350 --> 01:47:54,829
You know what you should do is go stand at the very edge where the world stops and try to get him to jump

1072
01:47:54,909 --> 01:47:57,220
And land over the edge of the world

1073
01:47:59,069 --> 01:48:01,229
I don't a lot of the bosses will avoid it

1074
01:48:01,869 --> 01:48:03,869
I feel like i'm gonna walk off by accident

1075
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:09,199
Okay, here it is

1076
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:10,000
Okay

1077
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:20,539
This is menacing

1078
01:48:20,539 --> 01:48:23,409
Uh, uh, yeah, he's he's not gonna

1079
01:48:24,529 --> 01:48:27,250
No

1080
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:40,369
He's gonna slide me off

1081
01:48:40,369 --> 01:48:42,430
Oh, hold on

1082
01:48:42,430 --> 01:48:45,180
Oh, please

1083
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:47,180
No, he's like clipping. Yeah

1084
01:48:47,739 --> 01:48:50,899
in the air

1085
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:53,970
Yeah halfway

1086
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:55,970
You're a medulla line of cheetos

1087
01:48:58,220 --> 01:48:59,340
Please

1088
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:02,300
If you would if you could do that for me, please. Oh man

1089
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:05,020
After gamer session

1090
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:11,229
What's that person even talking about? I what is this what just happened?

1091
01:49:12,029 --> 01:49:18,350
It oh, yeah, it heals it heals what it kills all of the animals in the area and heals off of them

1092
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:31,840
What the fuck?

1093
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,960
And all of the animals are in a pile. So I think it just hits all of them

1094
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:43,600
Yeah, every single animal in that actual boss's encounter room are spread out over the course of like a mile

1095
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:52,079
Okay, so uh, let's vote to i'm gonna like teleport out of here. So all right, we know that's there

1096
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:56,420
Can we at least get the item that's up there?

1097
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:59,739
Up where with the mog like enemy is blocking the way

1098
01:50:00,689 --> 01:50:02,689
Uh, we would have to go back a bonfire

1099
01:50:03,659 --> 01:50:09,100
We would oh we would okay, so we gotta go to the that's one behind the castle, right?

1100
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:14,430
How do I vote?

1101
01:50:14,430 --> 01:50:16,850
You just pick it

1102
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:27,539
Like pick the same one as you. Yeah, I think we probably both do it like in the same. Yeah

1103
01:50:29,819 --> 01:50:33,920
Go to caitlin

1104
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:46,960
I feel like we need to get through limb grave before we decide to go to k. Uh caitlin. Are you here?

1105
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,800
Yeah, oh

1106
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:51,090
Oh, yeah loads longer

1107
01:50:51,170 --> 01:50:53,170
Okay, so we need to

1108
01:50:53,569 --> 01:50:55,569
Is this I think it's a chest up there, right?

1109
01:50:57,869 --> 01:51:01,229
Uh, there's usually a good item up there. It's not guaranteed that there will be

1110
01:51:01,949 --> 01:51:17,220
Oh, let's try

1111
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:21,699
You know what? I would want to do if I was calling the shots you you absolutely can call a shot if you want

1112
01:51:23,149 --> 01:51:25,390
You know the chest that makes you go to bed and teleport you

1113
01:51:26,029 --> 01:51:28,029
to the crystal mine

1114
01:51:28,270 --> 01:51:29,890
I would go there

1115
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:31,090
We can do that

1116
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:37,279
Especially because when you run around the mine you just like smithing stones or something else

1117
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:41,520
And you can run around the swamp and pick up a whole bunch of items there

1118
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,680
What happened to the mog like enemy that was here?

1119
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:47,840
I don't know what a mog like is. Is it a new genre of game?

1120
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:54,460
I mean, I feel like you you know, you know and like you're not like part of our secret club

1121
01:51:54,539 --> 01:51:56,539
So kind of have to figure it out

1122
01:52:10,619 --> 01:52:17,890
All right, you can you can join secret club if you do this secret secret club handshake. Don't look up. Okay, you ready?

1123
01:52:18,449 --> 01:52:20,619
It's put your hand out

1124
01:52:20,619 --> 01:52:24,939
You shake hands you go like this you go like this you part the hair twice

1125
01:52:25,579 --> 01:52:30,539
You nod you nod you nod elbow elbow elbow to elbow elbow to elbow finger finger gun

1126
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:33,100
Okay, and then kiss

1127
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:39,949
Okay, a mog this item is worth it for you a mog like enemy is

1128
01:52:40,850 --> 01:52:42,850
It just is I don't know. It's a stupid

1129
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:45,630
This fire grease. It wasn't worth it

1130
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:52,420
Um, it's just those big burly guys that kind of look like mog. They're like the blood enemies big ones an omen

1131
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:58,430
Yeah, a mogan mogman mogman omen an omen enemy

1132
01:52:59,069 --> 01:53:05,729
An omen mogman. They're like the blood omen enemies. They have that we called them mog likes because I thought people

1133
01:53:06,289 --> 01:53:17,220
There's a whole thing. You're gonna have to go read like where we going first step starting. Uh bonfire first step

1134
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:18,579
Why do you want to go all the way back here?

1135
01:53:18,579 --> 01:53:27,260
You don't want to explore the other stuff on the peninsula. I told you where I wanted to go. Follow me

1136
01:53:27,819 --> 01:53:42,500
Okay, delete your way markers. I'll keep them because I like to remember where I was. All right, follow you

1137
01:53:43,949 --> 01:53:47,659
Oh, we should see where the dragon is

1138
01:53:48,699 --> 01:53:55,630
I wanted to go into down into that area where that's the teleport chest. Okay, lindell soldier

1139
01:53:57,539 --> 01:53:58,979
I'm ignoring him

1140
01:53:58,979 --> 01:54:01,659
So do you want to see who the dragon is?

1141
01:54:01,819 --> 01:54:05,579
It looks like it's a dragon. Uh, it's the way worst dragon

1142
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:10,699
Isn't that uh surrounded by a whole bunch of like goons in his vr chat lobby as you put it

1143
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:14,289
But we're not going we're not doing that. I want to go in the hole

1144
01:54:18,939 --> 01:54:20,939
This dude's spawn in with a ballista

1145
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:32,770
Yeah, it's uh, it's four to sex. Yeah, okay straight down this hole. There's a lot of shitty enemies here. I hope you uh,

1146
01:54:33,409 --> 01:54:35,090
I wish you the best

1147
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:40,529
I'm down and there's and there's a lot of enemies down here and he's blowing a trumpet

1148
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:46,369
uh

1149
01:54:46,369 --> 01:54:47,920
They're gonna

1150
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:51,439
Oh my god. Wait, I need to how do I say I need to sit in the mist. I can't get in there

1151
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
All right, I can't get in the mist

1152
01:54:54,560 --> 01:55:21,920
Good luck. Oh my god, please barf trigger. Don't kill me. All right. I made it. What do we got? Is that hold on?

1153
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:26,270
I may have actually just been

1154
01:55:26,270 --> 01:55:27,229
Shit

1155
01:55:27,229 --> 01:55:28,829
I can't use it

1156
01:55:28,829 --> 01:55:32,670
You ready?

1157
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:34,670
I'm as ready as i'm ever gonna be

1158
01:55:42,289 --> 01:55:46,770
Yeah, I don't I don't care what enemies generate in this area. There's no way it could be worse than what it actually is

1159
01:55:47,569 --> 01:56:05,520
That's true. That's so true. It actually made the area way easier. Okay. This is the one that has the

1160
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:08,800
Uh elevator that goes up and down and you can jump off in the middle

1161
01:56:11,729 --> 01:56:28,100
Okay, we're gonna run around the swamp grab some stuff. Oh i'm hitting this first try

1162
01:56:28,739 --> 01:56:31,619
Never mind

1163
01:56:31,939 --> 01:56:33,939
All the invisible thing

1164
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:36,750
Yeah, this one's annoying

1165
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:38,270
dung beetles

1166
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:54,460
Well, you just gotta stand in one spot. I'm not doing it. I'll do it. Yeah, I gotta stand in the right spot right here

1167
01:56:56,319 --> 01:56:57,359
ow

1168
01:56:57,359 --> 01:57:00,319
Um, this is not a place for us to be standing in one spot

1169
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:14,399
You'll be all right

1170
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:16,399
And I look forward to being able to let's go

1171
01:57:17,039 --> 01:57:19,039
I want to get this thing

1172
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:22,239
It's gonna be like a fucking dung. It's gonna be

1182
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:27,359
There's a flower thing up there

Okay. Oh, it's a giant beetle

Turn around turn around turn around what do you turn around?

1197
01:59:48,609 --> 01:59:51,819
Don't go in there. I made a wrong turn

1198
01:59:52,979 --> 01:59:55,859
I'm gonna get this fucking thing and we're gonna get the item that's inside of it

1199
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:01,199
There's a stone sword key. What did you get?

1200
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:03,920
Uh golden rune three. Where did you go?

1201
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:11,970
I went I went back down because that's a boss arena with a dragon in it. Yeah

1202
02:00:12,609 --> 02:00:26,529
I'm getting rid of these things

1203
02:00:26,529 --> 02:00:28,449
All right. So what is your

1204
02:00:28,449 --> 02:00:31,810
Why are you here? What was your plan here? You want to just run around?

1205
02:00:32,449 --> 02:00:38,000
No, there's like, uh the city over here has a whole bunch of items in it. We just got invaded

1206
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:54,779
It is one of those ulcerated tree spirits up there. We're not getting up there

1207
02:00:55,739 --> 02:00:58,050
It is no way this is

1208
02:00:59,810 --> 02:01:05,890
This is not happening man. This is worse than I thought it would be because of all the fucking gigantic enemies out here

1209
02:01:06,210 --> 02:01:10,289
It's not like slow swamp enemies anymore. It's everything you don't want. Okay

1210
02:01:13,229 --> 02:01:15,520
I got one of the uh

1211
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:20,189
I will meet you at the round table hold. Yeah, i'll see you at the round table

1212
02:01:20,430 --> 02:01:25,659
Okay, i'm gonna see if I can grab some shit. Somebody said comic con

1213
02:01:28,579 --> 02:01:31,380
Also all the people you can buy stuff from at the round table

1214
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:35,600
Gives a lot of item options

1215
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:40,880
All right, are we going to the round table hold or what?

1216
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:43,380
Yeah, go

1217
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:49,020
No, i'm saying like this is taking a while and i'm saying yeah go

1218
02:01:49,739 --> 02:01:56,609
Are you there now? No, but I can join you. I think we have to do the vote teleport, right?

1219
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:02,779
Um, no, i'm i'm there

1220
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:10,270
Okay, this was not worth it in my mind. It really is comic con usually running through here

1221
02:02:10,270 --> 02:02:14,510
you can grab a bunch of good stuff, but now it's all like flowers and and useless nothing and

1222
02:02:15,229 --> 02:02:16,750
God to your enemies

1223
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:23,149
What somebody got hurt who just got hurt? I just heard somebody go like

1224
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:33,439
Gideon looks fucking ridiculous

1225
02:02:35,170 --> 02:02:43,699
It's a different guy gideon looks like he's playing world of warcraft with a bunch of like level 25 greens

1226
02:02:45,729 --> 02:03:00,130
That's where I came out of right?

1227
02:03:00,449 --> 02:03:04,770
Yeah, I think it would be better to run along inside the mine than come out here

1228
02:03:05,329 --> 02:03:09,979
Okay, i'm just gonna come to you

1229
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,500
This is corin yeah

1230
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:20,500
He still kind of looks like thematically accurate doesn't he where'd he go?

1231
02:03:25,409 --> 02:03:38,239
Oh you respawn them. I wonder what you sell aspect of the crucible horns

1232
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:41,680
Oh, oh, yeah, you can't do it from this very one bonfire

1233
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:50,350
Did you say that you were gonna do magic because bordasaxe's lightning spear is on this guy. Uh, I mean that's that's faith, right?

1234
02:03:50,909 --> 02:03:56,909
It's faith, but this is arguably one of the best. Um, isn't this one of the best weapons in the game?

1235
02:03:57,069 --> 02:04:03,899
This is like one of the best a spells in the game. Isn't it pretty good. I don't want to

1236
02:04:04,859 --> 02:04:06,859
Do shit that cheesy

1237
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:12,380
I just I don't want the situation where one guy's like taking aggro while i'm throwing projectiles

1238
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:24,800
I can't wait to see the blacksmith. Wow, what an absolute gigachad and a game full of randomization

1239
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:50,020
He doesn't give a shit. He's just wearing the same clothes weird

1240
02:04:50,659 --> 02:05:00,659
Wait, you're just wearing corin's outfit with horns on greetings. Great. I am fear circumscript

1241
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:10,180
Perhaps you might share with me doing so and you do you think it's where I come from that your disdain is but should come pain

1242
02:05:10,899 --> 02:05:17,619
This game is so good

1243
02:05:17,619 --> 02:05:19,380
Are you here?

1244
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:22,739
Not yet. I had to go to a different bonafire and I haven't gotten the one yet

1245
02:05:22,739 --> 02:05:25,220
I thought there was one where I am and there is not

1246
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:28,189
it was like

1247
02:05:28,189 --> 02:05:32,029
These like this, uh, uh, this I can't even describe this

1248
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:35,659
It makes me laugh every time I see it though

1249
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,229
Oh

1250
02:05:45,229 --> 02:05:50,829
Got the middle finger filet. Oh, I caught you not doing the pose

1251
02:05:51,550 --> 02:06:16,300
Oh shit, you missed your acting cue. Can I use any of this? I don't think so

1252
02:06:20,270 --> 02:06:22,270
Insane weapon. What the fuck

1253
02:06:23,729 --> 02:06:34,989
Yeah, but I can't I don't have enough decks to put it on the key

1254
02:06:40,829 --> 02:06:45,439
I mean the key this is

1255
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,100
Did you on purpose make the worst build?

1256
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:53,699
No, I just freaked out and put every point in strength because I thought it was like holy shit

1257
02:06:53,859 --> 02:06:55,859
Well, look at this academy key

1258
02:06:56,770 --> 02:07:03,060
I already got one. Yeah, I already got one. I just saved money

1259
02:07:07,659 --> 02:07:09,100
I can't touch this

1260
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:21,550
Oh, okay. You do that every time what put every single point in strength. No, I didn't I played I played like a

1261
02:07:21,789 --> 02:07:26,670
I played like an int dex character warp to the round table to hold

1262
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:30,239
Um, I guess i'll agree because I think we both have to

1263
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:32,800
I thought you were already there

1264
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:38,079
I am but I think I have to like accept it for you to be here too. Maybe because i'm already here

1265
02:07:41,539 --> 02:07:43,939
Now it put you standing next to me and I didn't teleport

1266
02:07:44,619 --> 02:07:51,569
You look at 10 year old at subway who realizes he can ask for unlimited cheese. I probably have to leave

1267
02:07:52,539 --> 02:07:56,619
Yeah, let's uh do teleport back to the first bonfire. Yep first

1268
02:08:11,310 --> 02:08:13,310
Wait, well you can get unlimited cheese

1269
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:22,020
You know now, okay, so now

1270
02:08:23,300 --> 02:08:25,779
If you say go to the round table hole do we both get to go?

1271
02:08:26,579 --> 02:08:30,180
I already did. Oh you did. Okay. I think it's cute the round table hold. I think is

1272
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:33,859
fucked up for multiplayer here

1273
02:08:35,359 --> 02:08:37,359
I wonder if we can both do it again

1274
02:08:37,359 --> 02:08:39,920
Okay, i'm gonna do it. I already voted. Okay

1275
02:08:40,659 --> 02:08:52,050
You voted to warp to the round table hold. I guess it does work. Yeah, there you are. Cool

1276
02:08:52,529 --> 02:09:00,930
I am milania blade of mikala. Did you see uh, get in I just got here

1277
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:07,329
Oh, I thought you said you were already here. No, I haven't been here yet. I gave this guy a death root

1278
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:15,260
I had found one of those it doesn't have any clothes. Okay, that was weird. I thought I didn't have any pants on

1279
02:09:15,579 --> 02:09:24,979
We got mogue

1280
02:09:29,979 --> 02:09:45,199
Oh, yeah, go rank you look stupid

1281
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:47,899
Fuck you

1282
02:09:47,899 --> 02:09:58,000
Uh, I forgot what's the difference between arcane and intellect? Like what does arcane scale was that like the bleed stuff arcane is blood

1283
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:02,750
Arcane is also like its own weird thing with luck and stuff, right?

1284
02:10:03,729 --> 02:10:04,609
Yes

1285
02:10:04,609 --> 02:10:12,430
Yeah arcane is bleed blood. Yeah arcane is luck and bleed

1286
02:10:15,149 --> 02:10:27,649
Oh, they there's some dragon spells that scale with um arcane as well. You have the ripple blade that scales on it status build up

1287
02:10:34,369 --> 02:10:38,689
The npcs all have different outfits for stir. Oh because the items are randomized. That's right

1288
02:10:38,930 --> 02:10:57,470
Yeah, is this what gideon's face looks like underneath the helmet or is that randomized to bloodhound step?

1289
02:10:57,789 --> 02:11:08,659
They're selling me bloodhound step, but i'm poor so gideon has long white hair interesting

1290
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:19,090
They have faces

1291
02:11:19,090 --> 02:11:21,250
I've seen the dung. Um the dung eater's face

1292
02:11:21,970 --> 02:11:40,539
He must be new here i'm just call me he's just like kind of like a looks like a peasant or something

1293
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:46,100
Or just like a regular costume

1294
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:53,539
Oh, do you want to jump down here and fight the yeah, let's do it. Yeah, let's see what's down here

1295
02:11:53,859 --> 02:11:56,739

1296
02:12:12,449 --> 02:12:18,380
Okay. Oh, okay

1297
02:12:18,779 --> 02:12:21,600
Is it different? I think I think it's different

1298
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:25,600
Then it's frost attacks, right?

1299
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
And she's like frost out me

1300
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:30,000
Oh my god

1301
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:37,939
They got randomized gear

1302
02:12:37,939 --> 02:12:45,539
Do not let her do that dragon move. That's the fucking blood scythe

1303
02:12:49,579 --> 02:12:50,779

02:13:10,529 --> 02:13:12,050
I respond

1307
02:13:12,050 --> 02:13:15,739
Oh, you can come back down here then can't you even with the reduced health and stuff?

1308
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:18,380

02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:20,829
Oh and it's weird. She's I can't even see her

1310

1311
02:13:34,859 --> 02:13:36,539
Don't you do that?

1312
02:13:36,539 --> 02:13:49,260
What happened that was?

1313
02:13:50,619 --> 02:13:52,619
She has more than one dragon move apparently

1314
02:13:54,930 --> 02:13:56,449
She has all the

1315
02:13:56,449 --> 02:14:10,180
Super crazy. All right, let's go kill this motherfucker outplayed. I'm using a big long extra long toothpick right now

1316
02:14:18,579 --> 02:14:32,210
What? Watch out for the dragon

1317
02:14:35,890 --> 02:14:40,609
I have one shot me I think because I still had the debuff. I think we have the debuff. Yeah

1318
02:14:42,909 --> 02:14:50,100
It was our crush

1319
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:51,619
ah

1320
02:14:51,619 --> 02:14:53,619
Now you should go talk to the two fingers

1321
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:57,100
I hope the two fingers is

1322
02:14:57,869 --> 02:15:00,029
Like a I don't know like a rat or something

1323
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:04,189
The grand rat

1324
02:15:04,189 --> 02:15:08,220
I know you're gonna do the dragon thing again

1325
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:18,619
Where are you?

1326
02:15:18,619 --> 02:15:20,380

02:15:20,380 --> 02:15:23,550
It's an item. Oh there is there is

1328
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:48,159

I'm out. I'm out of here the fun. Hey fun fact, dude

1332
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:11,340
The weapon you have that toothpick weapon is one of the top 10 worst items in the game

1333
02:16:12,220 --> 02:16:16,779
Okay, we're gonna do what you wanted to do from the beginning and see how fate would have gone. We're gonna go up to

1334
02:16:17,579 --> 02:16:23,539
Morgoth no, you want you want this fight rest at the grace?

1335
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:26,020
Wipe that debuff

1336
02:16:26,020 --> 02:16:28,260
And get down there and we're gonna beat this lady

1337
02:16:28,739 --> 02:16:31,460
Okay

1338
02:16:31,460 --> 02:16:37,100
Easy. See I was only I was only dying because I had like four debuffs and I don't know how I got them

1339
02:16:40,139 --> 02:16:44,059
You're supposed to be like the gamer and like you're good at stuff. I'm still naked

1340
02:16:45,299 --> 02:16:47,780
You're like 20 levels 30 levels higher than me

1341
02:16:56,770 --> 02:16:58,879
Oh, no

1342
02:16:58,879 --> 02:17:00,639
It's not

1343
02:17:00,639 --> 02:17:16,270
Eat this

1344
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:18,579
Why are we not doing that this strategy?

1345
02:17:18,579 --> 02:17:22,079
Because he rolls

1346
02:17:22,079 --> 02:17:25,649
Get ready get it get it get it get it

1347
02:17:25,649 --> 02:17:28,370
All the npc fighters in this game. We need to just do that too

1348
02:17:29,090 --> 02:17:36,059
he rolls

1349
02:17:36,059 --> 02:17:37,500
And what happened there?

1350
02:17:37,500 --> 02:18:15,979
Dude, he almost fucking double killed us you I can't get I can't get a solid backstab

1351
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:21,059
All right, just keep the distraction up

1352
02:18:21,059 --> 02:18:25,940
Yeah, just do just do that. Just do that just run away and cast that spell and then he turns on me and i'm so slow

1353
02:18:26,579 --> 02:18:36,399
How was that not a backstab after I hit him? He turned damn it

1354
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:40,620
How many estus is uh, is it two or three?

1355
02:18:41,790 --> 02:19:00,059
um

1356
02:19:00,059 --> 02:19:16,860
What was that weird shit? I would have had the backstab. How many of those does this person have?

1357
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:21,409
That has to be the last one. I don't I think this

1358
02:19:22,049 --> 02:19:24,049
I think the other equipment

1359
02:19:24,049 --> 02:19:26,049
That she has is a

1360
02:19:27,389 --> 02:19:29,389
Like 10 estus flasks

1361
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:48,030
Nice yeah, don't do it. Don't do it. I'm so scared of the fire

1362
02:19:48,430 --> 02:19:54,049
I

1363
02:19:55,360 --> 02:19:58,159
Okay, all right, you're gonna also die there you got this dude

1364
02:19:58,239 --> 02:20:03,059
All right, but just you should maybe you should be alive. So i'm alive

1365
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:17,360
They're invisible to me. Oh my god. It's over. We're gonna lose

1366
02:20:21,579 --> 02:20:25,680
I can't see them

1367
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:31,280
What did you do? What did you do? I respond him. What do you mean you respond? How did you do that?

1368
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:34,079
I came down here and they're invisible to me and then they invaded again

1369
02:20:37,090 --> 02:20:39,090
Oh my god, dude, are you kidding me?

1370
02:20:39,969 --> 02:20:45,540
It's because you weighed it I

1371
02:20:47,010 --> 02:20:48,129
you

1372
02:20:48,129 --> 02:20:50,860
You hesitate it

1373
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:53,340
I wanted you to get the item if I die if you die

1374
02:20:56,049 --> 02:21:08,670
Just rest rest of the other round. I'm just gonna die then we're not messing this up again. Okay, we're good

1375
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:14,020
You got to read chat between attempts big guy

1376
02:21:14,979 --> 02:21:16,979
You sounded like a train whistle

1377
02:21:19,090 --> 02:21:22,739
All right. What do we need?

1378
02:21:22,739 --> 02:21:24,430
Upgrade the shirt

1379
02:21:24,430 --> 02:21:28,590
I don't want to upgrade the toothpick because I don't know if we're gonna get enough smithing stones to even complete anything

1380
02:21:28,590 --> 02:21:35,180
What's going on down there?

1381
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:39,540
I don't know you seem

1382
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:41,620
What the fuck just happened?

1383
02:21:42,899 --> 02:21:48,399
She was waiting for us, man. She was waiting for us. I don't see her

1384
02:21:49,459 --> 02:21:52,420
I resummoned her the whole this whole thing might be fucked now

1385
02:21:52,579 --> 02:21:57,139
Do we have to resummon her again you landed on the ground? I didn't even see the fire that killed you

1386
02:21:58,639 --> 02:22:00,639
Are there two of them down there?

1387
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:03,440
No, but I think it's desync

1388
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:10,059
Can we leave at least like if you want to fight this we can leave and come back because something is fucked up

1389
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:15,219
All right, we keep hold on

1390
02:22:15,219 --> 02:22:17,139
I'm gonna die

1391
02:22:17,139 --> 02:22:19,139
Die save i'm dead

1392
02:22:19,379 --> 02:22:23,139
All right, too bad on my screen you jumped off landed on the ground

1393
02:22:23,139 --> 02:22:31,680
There was nothing there and then you just died on fire just traveled to and from the round table

1394
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:41,010
Okay, let's just all right. You know what? Let's just leave we're gonna leave. I want to fight margott. Okay, let's go

The lizard in the cave. We have made no progress. I leveled up 30 times. I have not all right

1399
02:23:09,219 --> 02:23:10,639

Chain she's asking me about torrent again

1405
02:23:33,469 --> 02:23:37,649
Now she wants me to go around I was already at round table. He broke it

1406
02:23:46,799 --> 02:23:50,959
Why does he still have this? All right, so we debated if we were gonna trade like trade weapons

1407
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:54,639
Uh, and we came to the agreement that my game crashed

1408
02:23:55,120 --> 02:24:02,540
Oh, I would imagine something weird has been has been going on because once we went down. Yeah. All right

1409
02:24:02,620 --> 02:24:12,690
Let's just reset it you restart. I um, I crashed so I need to relaunch. All right, let's just reset it reset it

1410
02:24:13,809 --> 02:24:19,979
Just trade weapons. Yeah, but so it's like should we not I think it might be more interesting if we don't we don't trade

1411
02:24:24,909 --> 02:24:28,510
I just that was very weird. I went all the way back here. Oh, you know what?

1412
02:24:28,510 --> 02:24:32,190
I think I got teleported out of the game. I'm just gonna restart the game. It's probably for the best, right?

1413
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:39,979
Okay. Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna go to round table. I have like a long sword. I can upgrade to five up to you

1414
02:24:39,979 --> 02:24:41,860
Yeah, I think it's more fun this way

1415
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:46,020
Look if it gets to a point where we can't make any progress then whatever I I don't think that'll happen

1416
02:24:46,879 --> 02:24:49,120
Did you?

1417
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:53,840
Did you exit the whole game or did you just restart like the my my game crashed? Oh, okay

1418
02:24:54,590 --> 02:24:59,950
I think I don't I think I finally got the millennia go to round table hold and it was like super confused because I'd already been

1419
02:24:59,950 --> 02:25:04,700
There. All right. So should I try to join you? Uh

1420
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:10,540
Go to a bonfire and see if uh, you can talk to millennia before you rejoin me

1421
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:12,799
Actually, i'm gonna go to round table

1422
02:25:12,799 --> 02:25:18,879
I cannot and then invite you because my game still feels like it's being a little weird

1423
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:24,659
I feel like i'm okay

1424
02:25:24,659 --> 02:25:26,420
I go to gate front. Let's see

1425
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:33,020
Okay, then later I could um, I could just upgrade this weapon to uh,

1426
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:36,379
Give it a in in ashes of war when I find it if I upgrade a long sword

1427
02:25:37,579 --> 02:25:44,030
I no longer have millennia here. So, okay, give me one minute, sir

1428
02:25:44,430 --> 02:25:48,350
I didn't quit out of the whole game. I just kind of reset this. Okay, sir kind of thing

1429
02:25:48,350 --> 02:26:03,440
So I think we're okay. I don't have any I don't have any runes to do it

1430
02:26:07,889 --> 02:26:12,879
I got a different talisman though. Now. I definitely keep that on

1431
02:26:15,700 --> 02:26:17,700
We also I think it's always in the same spot

1432
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:23,409
We have to go get the like crystal elixir thing that you get for free at some point at the church

1433
02:26:25,420 --> 02:26:33,229
Did you buy that sacred tear that was on that vendor? I don't think I ever saw one that was you ours are different

1434
02:26:33,229 --> 02:26:42,819
Oh, that's right. It is different. I'm just gonna go grab whatever this uh, are you ready for me to join your game?

1435
02:26:43,139 --> 02:26:53,309
No, i'm upgrading my weapon. You have a plus five long sword. I'm back sniff sniff you died so many times

1436
02:27:07,069 --> 02:27:14,260
Can I put I could put glintstone pebble on it? I'm not doing it bloodhound step long sword

1437
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:25,600
Yeah, I got a little excited I got like 20 000 runes

1438
02:27:27,180 --> 02:27:31,229
I came into i'm gonna go to the gate house and set up the thing to invite you

1439
02:27:31,389 --> 02:27:35,840
Okay, i'm right there gate front. I brought like five dolls to the casino

1440
02:27:36,319 --> 02:27:43,090
And hit like a 50 000 jackpot and then put 50 000 on red and lost it all like I just freaked out

1441
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:46,770
I was just like let's go and I put everything into one spot and I just fucked everything up

1442
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:58,850
My world is open to wanderers. There's level two decks. I'm just gonna put two points in decks. I know everyone's gonna be like

1443
02:28:00,770 --> 02:28:24,159
It's that's gonna be fine. Don't worry. I'm using it. Does your character have a thong on? I don't think so

1444
02:28:24,850 --> 02:28:35,139
Okay, seems to be back to normal. Nice. How's the game audio everybody? Is it audio is good?

1445
02:28:35,379 --> 02:28:52,610
Are we in a good spot? I don't know what that is. But what's happening? Why are you why are you sitting here?

1446
02:28:53,940 --> 02:28:57,219
I'm I took my horse up all the way up the road. Oh you okay

1447
02:28:57,219 --> 02:29:06,510
You were just frozen for me for a sec. I figure we just do stuff up in this direction

1448
02:29:06,510 --> 02:29:11,260
There's a couple of the there's like a jail we can try those aren't dogs

1449
02:29:11,659 --> 02:29:14,700
I love that golden seed was actually a golden seed. Is that not random?

1450
02:29:16,239 --> 02:29:17,440
Um

1451
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:27,340
It should be it might not be but pretty lucky if that's the case. It's not random

1452
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:36,319
Yeah, I like actually deal damage now. I'm ready for the real market. I need to all right

1453
02:29:36,319 --> 02:29:39,620
So you want to go beat the you want to go do the worm?

1454
02:29:41,069 --> 02:29:44,510
Oh, we can do that if you feel like that you're confident that we could do. Yeah

1455
02:29:44,750 --> 02:29:46,750
I I feel confident I can kill it

1456
02:29:46,989 --> 02:29:52,780
I mean I can kill it and you can say that we can kill it that we can kill it that we as a team

1457
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:56,750
okay, just a little bit like you kind of

1458
02:30:00,319 --> 02:30:09,069
It's like

1459
02:30:09,069 --> 02:30:12,510
Don't we have to send? Um send her back to the round table

1460
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:15,940
Yeah, if you're kind of like a simp like that

1461
02:30:16,579 --> 02:30:30,510
She gave me a twig grove side cave. That is where is that one?

1462
02:30:31,229 --> 02:30:33,920
Where's the grove side cave?

1463
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:38,819
That's the one with the beast in it above the starting area

1464
02:30:39,790 --> 02:30:47,059
There it is

1465
02:30:47,059 --> 02:30:49,059
Please do a grover voice

1466
02:30:49,299 --> 02:30:51,219
That's me grover

1467
02:30:51,219 --> 02:30:53,139
I fucking hate that. I'm so pissed off

1468
02:30:53,139 --> 02:30:58,879
That was so cringy and i'm so annoyed with myself that I just listened to you. I don't know who grover is

1469
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:03,299
I wanted it. It's just like my body just decides to do that

1470
02:31:04,100 --> 02:31:07,459
Like hey do do an impression of peter griffin. Yeah, it should be peter griffin. It's like shut up

1471
02:31:08,180 --> 02:31:10,180
Shut up jump jump monkey

1472
02:31:10,739 --> 02:31:16,399
Dude, I swear to god. I saw your ass poking out the back of your flaps. All right, let's play

1473
02:31:18,459 --> 02:31:20,459
Don't let the intrusive thoughts in

1474
02:31:21,629 --> 02:31:23,629
All right ready gamers

1475
02:31:29,170 --> 02:31:30,690
This is do or die

1476
02:31:30,690 --> 02:32:11,809
Watch out watch out watch out

1477
02:32:11,809 --> 02:32:14,209
Oh, that's cheap. That's that's unfortunate

1478
02:32:16,719 --> 02:32:19,950
He zoned us

1479
02:32:19,950 --> 02:32:22,190
Oh my god, I can't even see anything

1480
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:26,559
You're okay kind of you're it's happening again

1481
02:32:30,500 --> 02:32:33,299
That was not fair. Can you do any other move?

1482
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:40,690
No, don't do that

1483
02:32:40,690 --> 02:32:43,809
I rolled I was mid-roll. This guy is cheating so hard

1484
02:32:44,610 --> 02:33:16,610
We're doing fine

1485
02:33:16,610 --> 02:33:18,370
Oh

1486
02:33:18,370 --> 02:33:21,569
Big deal big deal. Oh, come on. Come on

1487
02:33:23,010 --> 02:33:27,899
Why can't we get it? It's because it's better that you didn't because he would have had iframes for me

1488
02:33:28,459 --> 02:33:29,420
I

1489
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:34,059
He just woke up and started fucking throwing up in the corner. You got this i'll be right

1490
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:10,299
You got this

1491
02:34:10,299 --> 02:34:14,379
Why would you do that? I'm like concentrating don't just scream

1492
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:20,819
You got it. You're trying to make us lose

1493
02:34:21,540 --> 02:34:25,379
No mistakes now look what you've done. Look what you've done and now i'm distracted and now we're talking

1494
02:34:30,190 --> 02:34:43,059
Dodging watch out watch out we lose here. It's your fault. I'm just saying

1495
02:34:43,870 --> 02:34:45,870
I'm doing a scream stream

1496
02:35:02,979 --> 02:35:04,979
Don't get hit

1497
02:35:05,299 --> 02:35:16,659
Shut your mouth, please. All right scream. All right, let's do it

1498
02:35:24,379 --> 02:35:26,139
Yes, finally

1499
02:35:26,139 --> 02:35:32,920
Finally a weapon you want the wheel dude. I don't think I need the wheel considering that the gargoyles

1500
02:35:34,049 --> 02:35:52,799
It's a faith weapon. Oh, yeah, it's a pretty good sword or axe weapon. It is if I had a 22 faith

1501
02:35:54,760 --> 02:36:02,950
Uh, you need to bonfire. I I won't respawn. I need to bonfire. Yeah, like i'm not respawning

1502
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:12,680
Oh, i'm just gonna go back to the entrance. Is there anything else in here? Uh, no, what did you get?

1503
02:36:14,709 --> 02:36:18,760
Uh use this wheel the pizza cutter two-hander

1504
02:36:19,159 --> 02:36:22,120
uh

1505
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:27,920
My game is really freaking out that you teleport it. I rested at the graces that help you

1506
02:36:28,959 --> 02:36:31,329
Uh says you died

1507
02:36:31,489 --> 02:36:32,290
Yeah

1508
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:38,420
Now i'm respawning there you are. All right, so

1509
02:36:39,219 --> 02:36:48,200
Here so I discard

1510
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:53,159
Use the wheel. All right. I'm i'm taking all right. We're allowed three trades. I'm taking one of those trades

1511
02:36:53,159 --> 02:36:55,000
I want the wheel

1512
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:56,440
That's a nice rule

1513
02:36:56,440 --> 02:37:21,520
There you go. Yeah, it's pretty sick

1514
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:27,840
But I think i'm really like i'm think i'm really feeling the spear right now

1515
02:37:29,569 --> 02:37:46,370
Just feeling i'm feeling the spear for another like at least 20 minutes or I put it on all right

1516
02:37:46,370 --> 02:37:58,340
How much decks do I actually need? All right the next hopefully i'm gonna wish for like a bunch of good runes

1517
02:37:58,659 --> 02:38:01,159
All right. Where are we teleporting to though? Because we?

1518
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,959
Uh up to morgue. Yeah, let's go for it morgue it

1519
02:38:16,469 --> 02:38:20,579
Yeah, i'm gonna be your squire the whole game the way i'm dressed. Did you do the shack?

1520
02:38:21,719 --> 02:38:33,479
Yeah, my game I can't get off the map. I'm like frozen. Did that help? No, i'm stuck on the map and I can hear you walking around

1521
02:38:33,879 --> 02:38:42,159
Yeah, I just sat at the bonfire. It said warp to storm hills. Uh shack bailed. Oh, I I did it again

1522
02:38:42,239 --> 02:38:57,719
I voted again. I think here we go. Okay, good seamless. The axe is just the weapon art for faith. Can I actually use it?

1523
02:39:02,389 --> 02:39:03,989
Um, I have a weapon art

1524
02:39:03,989 --> 02:39:07,829
I can give you as well if you want if you can I don't even think you can change it on that weapon

1525
02:39:08,309 --> 02:39:10,309
I have like earthbreaker

1526
02:39:11,079 --> 02:39:13,079
After war I wonder if this works

1527
02:39:13,079 --> 02:39:17,280
Find out it wouldn't have the x on it though would it?

1528
02:39:18,159 --> 02:39:20,360
I wouldn't

1529
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:29,000
Uh, yeah, it's the axe. I don't think this is gonna work. Let's try it

1530
02:39:29,799 --> 02:39:38,370
Oh, oh

1531
02:39:38,450 --> 02:39:39,569
Oh

1532
02:39:39,569 --> 02:39:42,610
Actually, no, we're good. We're good. We're good. This actually works

1533
02:39:43,750 --> 02:39:45,750
This is doing this is okay

1534
02:39:46,229 --> 02:39:50,120
Doing more than before my little glint stone pebble on this long sword

1535
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:54,200
It does the same amount of damage from before if I hit something like 10 times

1536
02:39:58,229 --> 02:40:00,920
All right mount up

1537
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:04,840
Yeah, I was doing 71 damage before now. I'm doing 91. It has to be something right

1538
02:40:05,479 --> 02:40:07,909
I'm doing like 250

1539
02:40:07,909 --> 02:40:09,909
You got you got to get like the the

1540
02:40:10,149 --> 02:40:11,989
tier one somber stone

1541
02:40:12,309 --> 02:40:17,670
Somebody said no, dude, that sphere is really just that bad. What the hell is behind us? Okay, we're good

1542
02:40:35,139 --> 02:40:37,940
This is our uh, come back arc. I think so

1543
02:40:38,659 --> 02:40:44,420
I think we finally got like the critical mass of items the critical mass

1544
02:40:45,440 --> 02:40:47,120
Oh, do not aggro

1545
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:49,680
That fucking thing. Oh shit. It's the scion thing

1546
02:40:51,110 --> 02:40:53,750
Oh, it's coming after me. I'm just gonna go up into the tunnel

1547
02:40:54,549 --> 02:40:56,469
Which is going we're just running by

1548
02:40:56,469 --> 02:40:59,409
Yeah, okay kill this guy in one hit

1549
02:41:08,319 --> 02:41:14,850
Yeah

1550
02:41:14,930 --> 02:41:17,250
Can you do a marge simpson for me?

1551
02:41:18,709 --> 02:41:23,190
Homer it's me marge

1552
02:41:23,190 --> 02:41:27,350

1553
02:41:28,069 --> 02:41:29,409
Thank you

1554
02:41:29,409 --> 02:41:41,000

1555
02:41:41,799 --> 02:41:43,799
I hope so. I hope it's like a bug

1556
02:41:48,979 --> 02:41:52,049
If it's the same i'm skipping

1557
02:41:52,049 --> 02:41:55,969
Is it but if a rat it's him is it skip skip?

1558
02:41:57,700 --> 02:42:01,239
Oh, we just fought you what I don't want to fight you again

1559
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:17,920
Oh my god, hold on i'm dead i'm fat rolling right now because the stupid axe

1560
02:42:21,829 --> 02:42:22,950

1561
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:24,389
What happened to you?

1562
02:42:24,389 --> 02:42:28,309
I jumped over the lava, but it's just it's just doing the walk back and forth

1563
02:42:29,010 --> 02:42:33,110
Mocking us makar the fell omen. Why does it have that title?

1564
02:42:35,879 --> 02:42:37,879
It has the fell omen title

1565
02:42:41,250 --> 02:42:43,250
Oh, good luck. You're gonna take it all day

1566
02:42:43,969 --> 02:42:50,200
Still says the line

1567
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:57,940
Oh, man

1568
02:42:57,940 --> 02:43:06,129
Back to limb grave

1569
02:43:06,129 --> 02:43:10,209
This is the two-phase version the one that stands up. Oh, this is gonna be awful

1570
02:43:13,940 --> 02:43:16,739
We got this just just fix your fat rolling get naked with me

1571
02:43:18,469 --> 02:43:20,469
Me strong remember me strong

1572
02:43:20,870 --> 02:43:24,899
Okay, let's go that that last one was a test

1573
02:43:26,770 --> 02:43:31,620
How tarnished looks like you may be in search of the elden ring

1574
02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:59,809
Oh, yeah, you can't do that

1575
02:43:59,809 --> 02:44:01,809
This is gonna absolutely screw us

1576
02:44:07,090 --> 02:44:10,290
God damn it. That's why I didn't want to be back. That's why I didn't want to be over there

1577
02:44:34,239 --> 02:44:44,229
Whoa, please don't kill me

1578
02:44:44,549 --> 02:44:53,719
I forget if this is like sakiro and you can jump when he does that attack. Don't don't get the parry. Don't get the parry

1579
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:03,780
Oh, no, no, no, no, don't go off

1580
02:45:18,360 --> 02:45:35,860
Uh-oh, he's standing up. I don't remember this move said very well

1581
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:41,059
And i'm out of healing potions. It's a lot of really long wind-ups

1582
02:45:42,959 --> 02:45:44,959
What the fuck is happening?

1583
02:45:46,020 --> 02:45:55,190
Good question

1584
02:45:55,190 --> 02:45:58,840
Oh shit

1585
02:45:58,840 --> 02:46:00,840
Oh the iframes you're right careful

1586
02:46:07,729 --> 02:46:09,829
Sorry, I probably scared you

1587
02:46:09,829 --> 02:46:20,069
I was running away

1588
02:46:20,069 --> 02:46:26,420
What the heck dodge this?

1589
02:46:27,239 --> 02:46:29,239
We gotta get under him again. I shouldn't have run away

1590
02:46:36,229 --> 02:46:54,870
Big swing who wants me but you can have me

1591
02:46:55,510 --> 02:47:01,510
He's coming from me now watch out for the ninja turtle's leg

1592
02:47:02,549 --> 02:47:11,299
I'm trying to get this done

1593
02:47:11,299 --> 02:47:12,899
Oh my god

1594
02:47:12,899 --> 02:47:25,079
There it is kick his ass kick his ass I got the iframes stab at the end

1595
02:47:27,270 --> 02:47:33,079
Okay. All right. All right, back it up. Don't be crazy

1596
02:47:52,739 --> 02:47:58,659
I waited so long for the rule too. I felt like I timed it perfectly what that's fucked up

1597
02:47:59,379 --> 02:48:00,819
What?

1598
02:48:00,819 --> 02:48:02,819
That's fucked up in two ways

1599
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:15,989
How did he hit his bowl? I was behind I was back where his tail was that's called cheating

1600
02:48:16,309 --> 02:48:18,309
Oh, that sucks. It's all right

1601
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:23,959
How come you didn't grab your runes? I was focused

1602
02:48:28,120 --> 02:48:30,200
Shit. All right. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it

1603
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:38,209
We got it. I could feel that coming the whole that whole wind-up. I was like, I can't believe we're about to lose like this

1604
02:48:39,510 --> 02:48:41,510
Boy, I lost the runes. Wait, what?

1605
02:48:41,829 --> 02:48:43,829
Oh, whoops. Sorry. Okay. I'll get him back

1606
02:48:44,469 --> 02:49:06,469
I don't even know what hit me

1607
02:49:06,469 --> 02:49:16,309
Well on him

1608
02:49:16,309 --> 02:49:18,680
stamina

1609
02:49:18,680 --> 02:49:21,159
Careful, I thought you went off the edge for a second

1610
02:49:21,719 --> 02:49:46,360
How did that miss? I can't go over there

1611
02:49:58,530 --> 02:50:00,049
Oh my

1612
02:50:00,049 --> 02:50:05,329
Goodness, dude. No, I died. I I heard the dialogue start and I thought he was gonna phase transition

1613
02:50:07,250 --> 02:50:09,250
But then he did one more attack

1614
02:50:19,170 --> 02:50:26,100
I feel like I should just jump off the edge. I don't think i'm doing this with two health potions

1615
02:51:04,610 --> 02:51:05,649
Uh-oh

1616
02:51:05,649 --> 02:51:09,540
Uh-oh

1617
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:18,950
Yeah, there's no way I was gonna do that other one. He hates hitting the boss

1618
02:51:19,350 --> 02:51:24,790
This is the one I cannot believe we did not be I gotta get over that

1619
02:51:25,360 --> 02:51:33,510
Okay, if you need a second to rethink your life choices

1620
02:51:34,530 --> 02:51:37,409
Uh

1621
02:51:38,290 --> 02:51:49,920
Yeah, if you need a flower or a rock i've got it by the way

1622
02:51:53,729 --> 02:51:57,250
That was a really weird path that he took. I was so that was

1623
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:03,479
Okay, and we're stuck in the we're stuck in between that shit. Don't let it get to you

1624
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:15,299
We go again

1625
02:52:15,299 --> 02:52:17,799
I

1626
02:52:24,739 --> 02:52:28,420
Dude I came in coming in here so confident and it's just weird shit

1627
02:52:29,139 --> 02:52:31,299
I'm dead. No, you're not you're fine. And that doesn't that

1628
02:52:32,260 --> 02:52:35,940
Uh that right of passing skill

1629
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,559
Why have not must truly be in thy veins?

1630
02:52:40,200 --> 02:53:17,190
Somebody said have him drop the anchor for you, but that's two out of three items to trade just do it laughing my ass off

1631
02:53:18,790 --> 02:53:22,760
All right, this is okay focus confidence patience

1632
02:53:28,610 --> 02:53:41,600
Pulling it back chaos is a ladder bro. What are you doing?

1633
02:53:42,239 --> 02:53:47,360
Dude, I don't know. I'm sorry. I just give me the just give me the thing. Give me the fucking weapon

1634
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:49,520
Do you want me you want me to jump off?

1635
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:52,719
I just I don't know. I got locked in. I got locked in and I just

1636
02:54:00,319 --> 02:54:03,840
Give me the anchor. I don't have the anchor

1637
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:09,329
What do you mean?

1638
02:54:09,329 --> 02:54:21,159
I deleted the anchor remember? No when I first tried to drop you the anchor. I discarded it instead of dropped it. Oh

1639
02:54:21,719 --> 02:54:28,020
That's right. Otherwise, I have a knight rider halberd

1640
02:54:28,659 --> 02:54:30,450
I don't think that's it

1641
02:54:30,450 --> 02:54:34,719
Can I use that thing?

1642
02:54:34,719 --> 02:54:37,120
Uh, it's strength and dex how much dex?

1643
02:54:40,370 --> 02:54:41,729
um

1644
02:54:41,729 --> 02:54:45,280
Oh, no zero attributes required put it on the ground

1645
02:54:50,899 --> 02:55:02,950
Shit, how do I do this again?

1646
02:55:02,950 --> 02:55:04,950
Try the pizza cutter. I need more dex for that

1647
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:10,180
There you go. I'm pretty sure that's a good weapon too. Oh my god. Thank goodness. Let me see

1648
02:55:10,979 --> 02:55:12,979
That's your that's your number two out of three

1649
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:18,260
Oh, I just threw up. All right, this is the no, this is perfect. Yes. All right, we're good

1650
02:55:18,979 --> 02:55:45,110
Two out of three trades. I know

1651
02:55:45,110 --> 02:55:47,399
Pulling it back pulling it back

1652
02:55:47,399 --> 02:55:49,399
And it hits you with the back swing

1653
02:55:50,360 --> 02:55:52,680
I even was like calling like I know what's going on

1654
02:56:01,670 --> 02:56:05,399
Pulling it back. I dodged through it. I apparently not

1655
02:56:05,959 --> 02:56:09,840
I think you're a little early

1656
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:11,840
I fucked it that one

1657
02:56:12,479 --> 02:56:18,520
One shot me

1658
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:20,520
I've been hit by it before

1659
02:56:20,520 --> 02:56:37,329
I just jump off

1660
02:56:37,329 --> 02:56:39,409
Up to you. Okay, it's good. He's got a time

1661
02:56:40,850 --> 02:56:45,329
This game sucks, dude. No, this is not the real game. You probably haven't have you ever seen this before

1662
02:56:45,409 --> 02:56:54,180
This is not how the game is what we're saying. No one's jumping off this time. No escapes back to the war

1663
02:56:56,950 --> 02:57:01,190
Back to the wall. They aren't a war fight strong

1664
02:57:01,829 --> 02:57:03,430
never surrender

1665
02:57:03,430 --> 02:57:07,700
Legolas the inside of my nose is so itchy. Wait, do we have

1666
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:14,399
No, okay. Somebody said make sure you don't have the debuff that we have to clear. All right, we're good

1667
02:57:14,879 --> 02:57:18,159
No, do you have any like resins you can put on your axe like a lightning resin or something?

1668
02:57:18,799 --> 02:57:22,159
Before you walk in fire grease. Hold on. Let me I'm gonna put some of this shit on my bar

1669
02:57:22,879 --> 02:57:28,319
I'm gonna use every single one of these

1670
02:57:28,639 --> 02:57:35,379
All right. What is it? What is it?

1671
02:57:35,379 --> 02:57:36,500
blood

1672
02:57:36,500 --> 02:57:37,459
rot

1673
02:57:37,459 --> 02:57:38,870
poison

1674
02:57:38,870 --> 02:57:43,430
Fire against the fire magma rod i'm gonna boil i'm gonna do i'm gonna do blood

1675
02:58:00,719 --> 02:58:05,889
What?

1676
02:58:05,889 --> 02:58:07,329
Take your time

1677
02:58:07,329 --> 02:58:09,329
No need no need to rush in there

1678
02:58:09,489 --> 02:58:14,040
We're gonna get the blood filled up man

1679
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:22,479
Yeah, well, it's this boss. You can't

1680
02:58:23,280 --> 02:58:24,559
That's true

1681
02:58:24,559 --> 02:58:26,559
Come on really doing it again. Yeah

1682
02:58:30,639 --> 02:58:35,059
I dodged into him doing it and that hit me and almost knocked me off the mat. Uh-oh

1683
02:58:47,909 --> 02:58:50,149
I got this dude. Don't just like take a break

1684
02:59:22,079 --> 02:59:34,079
Watch that. Hi. Oh my god, dude. Look at stir. Just doing so good stir soloing the boss

1685
02:59:34,319 --> 02:59:40,290
Get your head of stir solo botch get your chat. Is that is this upsetting you?

1686
02:59:41,170 --> 02:59:44,680
It's supposed to be me doing that

1687
02:59:54,239 --> 02:59:56,319
You're doing you haven't been hit in

1688
02:59:57,219 --> 03:00:10,450
30 straight seconds stir is better than you and stir combined

1689
03:00:13,250 --> 03:00:18,049
Don't laugh at that. Don't laugh at that. That's not funny. That's it's not very funny

1690
03:00:18,770 --> 03:00:20,370
It's not funny

1691
03:00:20,370 --> 03:00:21,729
It is though

1692
03:00:21,729 --> 03:00:35,959
No, it's not

1693
03:00:35,959 --> 03:00:37,559
liability pov

1694
03:00:37,559 --> 03:00:39,559
Hey, uh if you don't

1695
03:00:39,639 --> 03:00:44,610
What happened there got hit by the tail the first time

1696
03:00:45,250 --> 03:00:51,559

1698
03:00:54,280 --> 03:00:56,280
Fucking held in ring bosses, dude

1699
03:01:01,559 --> 03:01:04,260

Uh-oh

1701
03:01:06,819 --> 03:01:09,000
Uh, I think something's wrong

1702
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:12,579
What the music's still playing and i'm still spectating you

1703
03:01:13,809 --> 03:01:20,209
He's still in there

1704
03:01:20,209 --> 03:01:23,170
Take me rest. There we go fix it. I think it did

1705
03:01:35,319 --> 03:01:39,299
Still hear me. Yeah, I hear you you were cutting out a lot though

Yeah, you sound good now. I see better. Are we good? It says you left. I probably just have to reconnect

1708
03:01:53,159 --> 03:01:56,479
All right. Hi, that was weird

1709
03:01:56,639 --> 03:02:04,180
Okay, yeah that boss fight just like broke my computer

You still have the thing down, right?

1711
03:02:16,719 --> 03:02:22,200
I don't know says I might have to put it down again. You probably do

1712
03:02:24,680 --> 03:02:26,440
I'm in the boss fight though

1713
03:02:26,440 --> 03:02:28,040
Why are you fighting the boss alone?

1714
03:02:28,040 --> 03:02:33,729
Okay, i'm jumping off. I'm gonna put it down. Why are you fighting the boss alone? You're doing your content without me

1715
03:02:33,809 --> 03:02:39,729
I didn't I didn't know how long you were gonna be disconnected. So I was just doing something

1716
03:02:42,950 --> 03:02:44,069
Yeah, i'm ready

1717
03:02:44,069 --> 03:02:56,579

1719
03:02:59,459 --> 03:03:08,950
You are joining another player. I am the chosen one

1720
03:03:10,040 --> 03:03:12,040
I will become elden lord

1721
03:03:16,420 --> 03:03:22,370
I might have to restart my game. Let me reset the game. Okay

1722
03:03:28,840 --> 03:03:29,719
Oh

1723
03:03:29,719 --> 03:03:34,399
That's fine. It's fine. You need it. You need it like a break

1724
03:03:36,229 --> 03:03:38,229
The game was you know, it's getting to your man

1725
03:03:38,389 --> 03:03:49,350
Let's try it. No. Oh you said he you need to use the separation mist

1726
03:03:49,989 --> 03:03:53,889
Do I because it already said you left

1727
03:03:54,479 --> 03:03:55,440
Oh

1728
03:03:55,440 --> 03:03:59,920
Whoa, okay. I am i'm in your world. You're not in a session now. Okay, let's see if that does it

1729
03:04:02,239 --> 03:04:05,920
What am I doing that? Do you put one down right? There's already one down

1730
03:04:07,319 --> 03:04:10,040
There should be yes. Okay. Let's see. I just restarted the game

1731
03:04:19,829 --> 03:04:23,170
No

1732
03:04:23,170 --> 03:04:25,170
Did I reset the game?

1733
03:04:25,409 --> 03:04:31,250
Like should I exit exit exit? Let me see if this works

1734
03:04:34,309 --> 03:04:41,030
Stirr has to restart. Oh, you have to restart. I think he needs to use it. So you have to do the separation mist

1735
03:04:42,079 --> 03:04:44,819
They said just waiting for instructions

1736
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:49,600
I'm doing i'm finding i'm doing i'm finding i'm finding i'm finding i'm finding i'm finding it. Where is it?

1737
03:04:51,700 --> 03:04:54,899
It's like a big it's like it looks like a moon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1738
03:04:55,219 --> 03:04:57,299
You lost 10 000 viewers. Yeah, it's all right

1739
03:05:01,829 --> 03:05:06,870
A thick mist envelops my world and I am now alone and I look like a pikachu or something

1740
03:05:07,590 --> 03:05:11,110
I don't know why that made my hair weirder way to change the way you looked

1741
03:05:11,750 --> 03:05:18,639
Yeah, my all of my like bodily hair became like paint. Okay, now i'm opening my world

1742
03:05:18,639 --> 03:05:22,000
To watchers once more uh wanderers not watchers

1743
03:05:23,239 --> 03:05:29,600
Okay, and now you're trying to join me joining now

1744
03:05:42,420 --> 03:05:44,659
Yeah, I lost 10 000 fucking viewers

1745
03:05:46,309 --> 03:05:48,870
So happy they're never coming back

1746
03:05:49,510 --> 03:05:51,110
like next stream

1747
03:05:51,110 --> 03:05:53,430
They're they're like, uh, nah, that was it

1748
03:05:54,149 --> 03:05:56,549
So everyone that is coming back

1749
03:05:57,110 --> 03:06:00,629
Yeah, they're not they're gonna miss this shit. That's on them

1750
03:06:02,760 --> 03:06:05,399
I hate when that hits you and you're like dodging it

1751
03:06:12,399 --> 03:06:14,159
I don't want to be in this corner

1752
03:06:14,159 --> 03:06:23,379
Yeah, that's bad

1753
03:06:23,379 --> 03:06:25,860
You're in that corner. You're in that corner

1754
03:06:26,819 --> 03:06:31,350
It'll be fine. Mm. I don't like you being over there. It's too close to the

1755
03:06:34,370 --> 03:06:36,290
What's he gonna do hit me?

1756
03:06:36,290 --> 03:06:43,079
Stir, I don't like this

1757
03:06:49,489 --> 03:06:51,250
I'm farming him dude

1758
03:06:51,250 --> 03:06:59,729
I'm backing up now. You're in the corner now. It's not me

1759
03:07:04,209 --> 03:07:05,409
Oh, yep

1760
03:07:05,409 --> 03:07:24,440
Where am I? Oh you got good backing up. I don't watch out fire behind you

1761
03:07:26,200 --> 03:07:29,510
Thank you for the heads up

1762
03:07:29,510 --> 03:07:37,670
He's gonna pull it back and it has a hitbox the size of the earth

1763
03:07:38,309 --> 03:07:51,750
Gonna stand up in a second. Oh, yeah

1764
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:55,840
He's been in this corner this entire time

1765
03:07:59,600 --> 03:08:12,690
Oh fucking ninja turtle

1766
03:08:12,690 --> 03:08:17,559
Big swing you've gotten used to that timing after dying twice. Mm-hmm

1767
03:08:25,700 --> 03:08:32,479
No, he got you he fucking stepped on me, dude

1768
03:08:35,379 --> 03:08:38,239
We can't do it dude

1769
03:08:38,319 --> 03:08:42,559
It's like if we miss time that one time we die. I think when we see him go for it

1770
03:08:42,559 --> 03:08:44,239
We need to just run away

1771
03:08:44,239 --> 03:08:46,239
Like not even roll just like walk away

1772
03:08:50,280 --> 03:08:56,479
I'm gonna upgrade my weapon

1773
03:08:56,479 --> 03:09:03,040
Do you have the upgrades for it? I think I have I should hey remember, uh, you only need to use one

1774
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:09,520
Stone per upgrade. Oh, all right. Let's i'm gonna go upgrade this a couple times

1775
03:09:13,329 --> 03:09:17,809
Wait, what? Oh, that's right. You you you cheated. I forgot I cheated

1776
03:09:18,290 --> 03:09:24,290
Didn't you she said like shouldn't it be like one two then five then ten then ten or something it goes like one three six

1777
03:09:24,770 --> 03:09:28,690
One three six one three six. I'm pretty sure or like one two three four

1778
03:09:29,010 --> 03:09:29,489
Yeah

1779
03:09:29,489 --> 03:09:30,899
but um

1780
03:09:30,899 --> 03:09:36,739
I played randomizer before and like I said, it took me like eight hours of walking around looking for smithing stone threes and it wasn't fun

1781
03:09:37,639 --> 03:09:39,639
oh, it was just like

1782
03:09:39,639 --> 03:09:41,840
extremely tedious

1783
03:09:41,840 --> 03:09:42,879
uh

1784
03:09:42,879 --> 03:09:53,190
Did you go back to the hole? No, did you you're still standing here? I tried to warp to it. I voted to warp there

1785
03:09:54,420 --> 03:10:00,129
Even just one or two times my game crashed

1786
03:10:00,850 --> 03:10:01,969
No

1787
03:10:01,969 --> 03:10:07,090
Yeah, something about round table hold is not great. Maybe we need to go to that other blacksmith and get that waypoint

1788
03:10:07,250 --> 03:10:21,319
Yeah, who's uh not yeah. Oh, yeah in the first church you can blacksmith there. We should do that

1789
03:10:23,170 --> 03:10:29,479
Can you do everything there? Like can you uh, you can just do everything doesn't matter. Yeah, we'll start doing that then

1790
03:10:29,799 --> 03:10:33,719
I think that one has a limit and then you need to find the giant blacksmith

1791
03:10:33,799 --> 03:10:38,549
If you wanted to do everything without going to hold how much is it to upgrade this shit?

1792
03:10:47,479 --> 03:10:57,090
The church has a limit of up only up to plus three. Can I sell?

1793
03:10:57,649 --> 03:10:59,090
Can I sell too?

1794
03:10:59,090 --> 03:11:04,020
You know also if you want to go to that first mine

1795
03:11:04,930 --> 03:11:06,610
I don't think it will be smithing stuff

1796
03:11:06,610 --> 03:11:12,579
But there's still like a ton of items to pick up in those mines the blacksmith can sell

1797
03:11:12,579 --> 03:11:22,209
Oh, I thought it was not the blacksmith but the blacksmith didn't let you do it. I swear. I i'll get it

1798
03:11:22,209 --> 03:11:24,600
Right. It's been a while since I've played elden ring

1799
03:11:39,389 --> 03:11:48,360
690 that's a weird number. Yeah, that's my graphics card. How many what's going on right now?

1800
03:11:53,909 --> 03:11:57,170
All right, so boom i'm gonna upgrade this

1801
03:11:57,969 --> 03:12:03,809
Once because I don't think I can afford anything else. Don't have any just random stupid items. I can just get rid of

1802
03:12:04,850 --> 03:12:31,329
I don't like this

1803
03:12:31,329 --> 03:12:40,069
828 what I can't warp. All right. I this thing is pretty good now

1804
03:12:40,840 --> 03:12:51,379
Okay, I believe in us. I'm gonna put my thing down push your thing down. You sold the rivers of blood your problem

1805
03:12:51,620 --> 03:12:56,500
That's what I should i'm pretty sure also you can sell uh the grave wards for quite a bit

1806
03:12:56,819 --> 03:13:10,420
Which I should do just level this is my first stream. What emotes should I use?

1807
03:13:11,969 --> 03:13:13,969
Uh, you probably should use um, okay. Yes

1808
03:13:16,440 --> 03:13:18,870
I am ready to join you

1809
03:13:19,510 --> 03:13:21,510
Join me do it. It's all on you

1810
03:13:31,190 --> 03:13:35,110
I will say for how crazy and broken and buggy this could really be

1811
03:13:36,440 --> 03:13:37,760
this

1812
03:13:37,760 --> 03:13:39,940
Works pretty smoothly

1813
03:13:39,940 --> 03:13:45,620
This is actually remarkable that we've only had a couple of small bug like crashes in three hours playing this

1814
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:59,799
All right. This is the one

1815
03:13:59,799 --> 03:14:04,319
That's so much damage

1816
03:14:04,319 --> 03:14:07,200
Come on, bro. I'm dead. I slid all the way off

1817
03:14:07,920 --> 03:14:13,299
I'm supposed to see how much damage I do

1818
03:14:13,459 --> 03:14:17,059
100 that's better

1819
03:14:17,059 --> 03:14:18,639
What was it?

1820
03:14:18,639 --> 03:14:20,639
It was like 90 like 70

1821
03:14:22,370 --> 03:14:24,680
Hey, don't worry. I got this

1822
03:14:24,680 --> 03:14:27,170
Watch this

1823
03:14:27,170 --> 03:14:31,010
Oh, I do germa is so much better than germa and stir. I check this up

1824
03:14:41,459 --> 03:14:42,659
I mean

1825
03:14:42,659 --> 03:14:46,819
I will have to bow to you for all eternity. Really if you beat him right now. Are you serious?

1826
03:14:47,540 --> 03:14:49,719
Yeah

1827
03:14:49,719 --> 03:14:53,159
I even have a fun story if you wanted after this, okay related to that

1828
03:14:53,879 --> 03:15:18,739
Honestly, also, I feel like we would have done this if either of us had like plus one s this

1829
03:15:30,680 --> 03:15:34,440
Sorry, bro. Did your game crash? Mine just did mine did not

1830
03:15:34,920 --> 03:15:36,440
Uh, I crashed

1831
03:15:36,440 --> 03:15:41,280
The ai took over I mean you did say that this wasn't as buggy as it could be a second ago

1832
03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:43,799
So you were asking for it

1833
03:15:43,799 --> 03:15:47,719
Yeah, but kind of like, you know what happens in life or death when somebody drops out of the game like the ai took over

1834
03:15:47,799 --> 03:15:57,159
That's what you were just watching. We doing this or what? We did it first try. Oh, I thought you actually okay

1835
03:15:57,319 --> 03:16:01,079
Yeah, we're doing that we're doing it just first try how what the

1836
03:16:02,739 --> 03:16:05,219
Heck what the why is this health gone?

1837
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:10,840
Dude, i'm fucking rolling by it

1838
03:16:22,340 --> 03:16:28,100
This the salamander crawl i'll say uh, worst monster move in all dark souls games

1839
03:16:28,819 --> 03:16:30,659
No, it is not

1840
03:16:30,659 --> 03:16:32,340
Not even close

1841
03:16:32,340 --> 03:16:34,739
What's worse than this the bed of chaos?

1842
03:16:35,700 --> 03:16:38,180
The bed of chaos swipe move is worse than this by far

1843
03:16:39,139 --> 03:16:40,979
I don't remember that

1844
03:16:40,979 --> 03:16:42,979
No way. This is not even close

1845
03:16:49,729 --> 03:16:50,950
dude

1846
03:16:50,950 --> 03:16:54,610
Dude, I haven't gotten to participate yet

1847
03:16:57,780 --> 03:17:05,540
And i'm out of flasks

1848
03:17:05,540 --> 03:17:13,409
Fuck but you're out of flasks right now

1849
03:17:14,290 --> 03:17:17,409
Yeah, I i take so much fucking damage

1850
03:17:27,440 --> 03:17:30,239
I I could sense you're tilted right now and it's like fucking up my game

1851
03:17:31,780 --> 03:17:35,540
Well, this whole fight I believed and then you come in and then he walks

1852
03:17:35,780 --> 03:17:39,940
He walks away from you then he walks away from you and then he walks away from you

1853
03:17:39,940 --> 03:17:43,059
And then he does all of your health and damage from walking away from you

1854
03:17:48,559 --> 03:17:50,819
Okay, um

1855
03:17:50,819 --> 03:17:51,780
We should

1856
03:17:51,780 --> 03:17:53,780
One more try and then we'll go explore

1857
03:17:54,040 --> 03:17:56,469
Germa has six flasks

1858
03:17:56,469 --> 03:17:59,430
Yeah, do you yeah, are you for real?

1859
03:18:00,229 --> 03:18:01,750
Where are you?

1860
03:18:01,750 --> 03:18:10,149
I have three flasks. How many mana flasks do you have? I had one because I was actually using glintstone pebble. Why did

1861
03:18:11,110 --> 03:18:14,559
What you using glintstone pebble right now? I was

1862
03:18:15,520 --> 03:18:20,639
I'm gonna take it off. I mean i'll be i'm seeing a lot of omega lows, but we're dying in one hit doesn't matter

1863
03:18:22,040 --> 03:18:27,959
You hey you I have six flasks. That's true, but we're dying in one hit from that move

1864
03:18:28,600 --> 03:18:32,659
skill issue

1865
03:18:32,659 --> 03:18:36,200
silence

1866
03:18:36,200 --> 03:18:38,360
About to go full gamer mode dog. Yo

1867
03:18:39,399 --> 03:18:41,399
Oh want to walk away real quick?

1868
03:18:41,639 --> 03:18:47,510
That's the worst fucking move in any dark so i'm telling you i'm telling you no it is not

1869
03:18:48,069 --> 03:18:53,989
The worst move in all of dark souls. You know, let's just be let's just focus. Okay. You know what I

1870
03:18:56,370 --> 03:18:58,979
Just dodge it dude

1871
03:18:58,979 --> 03:19:01,780
Just dodge it. Why are you not dodging it? You got here in my

1872
03:19:03,329 --> 03:19:05,329
Why why can't you dodge that move?

1873
03:19:06,129 --> 03:19:08,129
If that moves on a problem, why don't you just walk?

1874
03:19:08,770 --> 03:19:14,690
Just spam it three times and put fucking lava on every square inch of the map and push you off with it

1875
03:19:15,569 --> 03:19:17,329
We're fighting this boss

1876
03:19:17,329 --> 03:19:19,889
In the area where he's not supposed to be right now

1877
03:19:20,450 --> 03:19:25,860
That's the issue. All right, relax. We're good. We're good. We're gonna get in there

1878
03:19:26,930 --> 03:19:29,569
We beat him the first try with by the way

1879
03:19:30,049 --> 03:19:33,889
I was using a weapon that was only doing like 60 damage to swing when we beat him last time

1880
03:19:34,129 --> 03:19:41,250
Okay, let's do it again. You finally got six upgraded flasks. It's not the problem. That's not the problem

1881
03:19:41,569 --> 03:19:45,569
That's not the problem. I feel like we would have won if I had fucking six flasks

1882
03:19:45,809 --> 03:19:49,889
I don't think so. You've died in one hit by that move each time

1883
03:19:56,610 --> 03:19:58,610
See look, we're good. Good. Just relax

1884
03:19:58,850 --> 03:20:03,940
No him walking away from you good. You're good. We're not good

1885
03:20:04,739 --> 03:20:17,809
Here he comes again. I'm just gonna like afk because that's that's all

1886
03:20:18,450 --> 03:20:20,450
That's all I got. I'm just gonna afk over here

1887
03:20:28,049 --> 03:20:31,969
You why you're not afking? You're fine. I was while he was running around

1888
03:20:32,690 --> 03:20:46,790
All right. This is a good start

1889
03:20:46,790 --> 03:20:51,969
We're good. Oh my god, dude

1890
03:20:53,360 --> 03:21:15,090
Nice aim not you him. All right, easy

1891
03:21:15,809 --> 03:21:28,850
I the greed was kind of strong there. The greed was a little strong

1892
03:21:29,489 --> 03:21:31,489
the

1893
03:21:33,409 --> 03:21:35,409
You should have ran away from him

1894
03:21:37,809 --> 03:21:40,129
When he faced transitions you can hit him for free

1895
03:21:40,690 --> 03:21:44,610
There was no greed then he just did that one attack and I mistimed it and then I died

1896
03:21:45,090 --> 03:21:47,090
What you did? No, but I'm

1897
03:21:52,340 --> 03:21:56,260
When he says the words and he puts he always puts lava on his sword

1898
03:21:58,069 --> 03:22:01,350
The fuck I'd watched you respawn in you need to rest

1899
03:22:01,989 --> 03:22:05,670
at the bonfire

1900
03:22:05,670 --> 03:22:07,670
You're a coward. We're not cowards. Why?

1901
03:22:08,309 --> 03:22:21,840
That was a good attempt though. This is just how you this is hey, this is randomizer. What's the what's the worst boss moves?

1902
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:25,360
What's your your least favorite? You were saying some boss. I don't really remember it

1903
03:22:25,920 --> 03:22:26,799
uh

1904
03:22:26,799 --> 03:22:29,840
All of radan's entire move set every single one

1905
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:34,000
Every single move radan does

1906
03:22:34,079 --> 03:22:38,239
Okay, and and that's that's one through ten and then everything else is like 11 to 12 13

1907
03:22:39,170 --> 03:22:42,450
Yeah, what comes that like we're just gonna pretend that boss doesn't exist. Okay

1908
03:22:45,829 --> 03:22:47,680
um

1909
03:22:47,680 --> 03:22:50,319
I feel like you have to I'd have to like refresh my memory

1910
03:22:50,559 --> 03:22:54,159
But I feel like a lot of stuff in dark souls 2 was unbelievably annoying

1911
03:22:57,090 --> 03:23:01,170
It is what it's usually like the setup of things and not one individual move

1912
03:23:01,889 --> 03:23:32,799
stuck on a fucking tree

1913
03:23:41,409 --> 03:23:44,049
He just hit me with the butt of his thingy

1914
03:23:44,850 --> 03:23:57,250
We're good

1915
03:23:57,250 --> 03:23:59,010
Where did he go?

1916
03:23:59,010 --> 03:24:00,600
Where is he?

1917
03:24:00,600 --> 03:24:06,000
What he deleted me? I thought he was still doing the other side

1918
03:24:06,639 --> 03:24:20,149
You may need to restart the game. Yeah, i'm out of the fight and respawn me. I'm not spectating you

1919
03:24:24,260 --> 03:24:26,260
Okay, so now i'm coming back

1920
03:24:26,600 --> 03:24:28,840
Okay, I want to go let's go through like the first

1921
03:24:29,719 --> 03:24:32,600
And we'll come back. We just need like a 10 minute away from here

1922
03:24:33,079 --> 03:24:41,760
We're gonna go where the dragon is in the beginning go back to the first step. We're gonna go into the fucking the upgrade mine

1923
03:24:42,950 --> 03:24:44,950
Okay, so you want to go to?

1924
03:24:45,600 --> 03:24:47,600
First step the first step

1925
03:24:51,299 --> 03:25:00,120
Okay. Yeah, so we'll we'll come back. We'll be fine

1926
03:25:00,680 --> 03:25:04,450
There's no sense in getting upset by this

1927
03:25:04,530 --> 03:25:05,809
I am

1928
03:25:05,809 --> 03:25:07,809
So happy to be playing games

1929
03:25:07,809 --> 03:25:12,440
My good friend exactly. There's no what's the point of getting upset about this?

1930
03:25:13,079 --> 03:25:16,290
It's a tricky game

1931
03:25:16,290 --> 03:25:18,950
Game's tricky. It's hard

1932
03:25:19,590 --> 03:25:22,870
So you're asking about why I have so many flasks did you not pick up the golden seed at that

1933
03:25:23,270 --> 03:25:25,190
The places where you could we walked by two of them

1934
03:25:26,129 --> 03:25:30,290
Uh, they were not golden seeds. They weren't I thought people said that wait did

1935
03:25:30,850 --> 03:25:31,969
that

1936
03:25:31,969 --> 03:25:32,930
It is

1937
03:25:32,930 --> 03:25:37,159
I don't know. Maybe your seed

1938
03:25:37,159 --> 03:25:40,680
There is a setting so that you can always have those be golden seeds

1939
03:25:42,040 --> 03:25:44,700
And your seed is uh, we're going around

1940
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:53,139
You don't want to fight this right now, I don't want to I don't want to talk about it. I just want to go

1941
03:25:53,860 --> 03:25:59,430
You know diggy diggy hole

1942
03:26:00,069 --> 03:26:04,920
Or like a shirt of some kind. I would like a plus one to my flask

1943
03:26:04,920 --> 03:26:08,040
So I don't have to use like three flasks every one time I get hit

1944
03:26:12,719 --> 03:26:20,840
Yeah

1945
03:26:20,840 --> 03:26:44,000
All right. People normally suck this bad at this

1946
03:26:45,280 --> 03:26:50,959
Yeah, usually worse. It's usually it this that's that's why people you know, that's why people play these games

1947
03:26:51,520 --> 03:26:54,290
It's because it's usually

1948
03:26:54,290 --> 03:26:56,290
Usually it takes a mugger

1949
03:26:56,610 --> 03:27:00,850
There's fucking fruits growing out of the wall. I was gonna say I picked up like a mushroom

1950
03:27:31,360 --> 03:27:33,440
I miss dark and darker. Did you play that?

1951
03:27:34,610 --> 03:27:39,250
I did a little bit. Is it good? I only played like the first beta and it was actually a lot of fun

1952
03:27:39,809 --> 03:27:43,729
It looks really cool

1953
03:27:43,729 --> 03:27:47,170
Definitely wish it had a little bit more to it, but it was great

1954
03:27:48,680 --> 03:27:50,680
Hopefully when they actually come out in beta

1955
03:27:51,239 --> 03:27:53,799
It will be a lot more right?

1956
03:27:53,799 --> 03:27:57,459
Yeah, like it's still like another like year of development or at least

1957
03:28:04,559 --> 03:28:25,200
Okay, there's a boss down here too. Isn't there should be there's always a boss in the mines. You should do a backflip

1958
03:28:28,319 --> 03:28:33,760
No, i'm good. Watch out pot friend actually is

1959
03:28:41,190 --> 03:28:42,149
ow

1960
03:28:42,149 --> 03:28:49,959
stone sword key

1961
03:28:50,979 --> 03:28:53,540
Wait a minute

1962
03:28:54,579 --> 03:28:56,020
I'm waiting

1963
03:28:56,020 --> 03:28:58,420
I that I think I might that thing actually might be amazing

1964
03:29:05,350 --> 03:29:07,350
great omen killer cleaver

1965
03:29:10,290 --> 03:29:11,729
uh

1966
03:29:11,729 --> 03:29:19,760
Decent I think the axe that you have would do better if you could use it really I believe so

1967
03:29:25,139 --> 03:29:27,139
Uh, where did where are you?

1968
03:29:27,379 --> 03:29:31,700
Uh, we go back to elevator and there's a this one has the jump off point. All right

1969
03:29:35,200 --> 03:29:41,600
Facing forward. Yeah, i'm definitely gonna put at least two three points

1970
03:29:41,600 --> 03:29:44,799
I gotta I gotta put at least like 14 other way other way. What do you want?

1971
03:29:48,360 --> 03:29:51,799
What do you mean other way? Oh, I thought you know because you're facing the other direction

1972
03:30:09,350 --> 03:30:16,709
Okay, so if this is a magma worm in this boss door, i'm going i'm gonna go buy a lottery ticket today

1973
03:30:17,829 --> 03:30:22,229
I I would do the opposite of buy a lottery ticket because i'm fucking sick of him

1974
03:30:23,190 --> 03:30:41,250
Ooh

1975
03:30:41,250 --> 03:30:43,250
Whatever is let him stay there

1976
03:30:43,809 --> 03:31:01,569
Okay

1977
03:31:01,569 --> 03:31:05,649
Okay, can we peek in there? I hope it's another mad soldier

1978
03:31:08,049 --> 03:31:10,290
Love that boss

1979
03:31:10,290 --> 03:31:11,889
Is it a magma worm?

1980
03:31:11,889 --> 03:31:13,409
Oh god

1981
03:31:13,409 --> 03:31:15,409
Oh, this is bad. We're not gonna be able to beat this

1982
03:31:16,280 --> 03:31:18,680
No, we like don't even have a blunt weapon to hit it with

1983
03:31:20,819 --> 03:31:22,819
Let's we can do some damage

1984
03:31:23,059 --> 03:31:36,000
What the fuck what? Okay. What i've been grabbed. I am being grabbed. I am

1985
03:31:36,959 --> 03:31:40,579
Being grabbed

1986
03:31:40,579 --> 03:31:42,579
When he grabbed you my game just froze

1987
03:31:46,850 --> 03:31:49,409
Holy shit, that's fast. I thought it was slower than that

1988
03:31:55,719 --> 03:31:57,719
Oh my god, give me away from the fucking door

1989
03:32:00,899 --> 03:32:06,680
I actually don't know this boss's move set at all. I I never fought it

1990
03:32:07,159 --> 03:32:10,520
I've tried to fight it once. I was like, I don't like this and then I never did it

1991
03:32:11,719 --> 03:32:17,459
I mean you're really kind of supposed to fight this boss with the horse

1992
03:32:18,420 --> 03:32:38,120
Yeah, he's hard to chase down. Oh my god. He just moves around so erratically

1993
03:32:43,360 --> 03:32:47,040
This this is definitely a horse. This is a this is a horse fight. It really is

1994
03:32:47,600 --> 03:33:02,389
I don't know what that is

1995
03:33:02,549 --> 03:33:08,500
It's called it you get on the horse and don't get hit by it

1996
03:33:14,340 --> 03:33:16,340
Every swing you fucking hop

1997
03:33:16,979 --> 03:33:35,760
I he's

1998
03:33:35,760 --> 03:33:37,760
Run run run run run run just sprint trying

1999
03:33:38,899 --> 03:33:40,920
trying

2000
03:33:40,920 --> 03:33:42,200
trying

2001
03:33:42,200 --> 03:33:44,760
But I got like staggered by every single hit

2002
03:33:45,399 --> 03:34:16,370
You got this

2003
03:34:16,450 --> 03:34:19,479
No, I do not he's got this

2004
03:34:23,920 --> 03:34:27,120
Dude every one of his moves. It's like i'm going to the river and then i'm

2005
03:34:31,809 --> 03:34:34,770
Stake of maricop you're supposed to be on the horse for this fight

2006
03:34:36,309 --> 03:34:38,790
No, there there definitely is one of these that is in a mine

2007
03:34:39,190 --> 03:34:51,139
But I don't know if the movesets are the same. I can't remember. We got it. Are we uh sprinting are we fighting?

2008
03:34:52,659 --> 03:35:05,959
Let's go you fight one in the seletano. Really?

2009
03:35:06,760 --> 03:35:08,739
Yeah

2010
03:35:08,739 --> 03:35:11,620
I do think it's like um

2011
03:35:11,680 --> 03:35:18,459
Significantly weaker than the main one

2012
03:35:19,920 --> 03:35:27,879
It's okay. We're ready. We were refreshed on the move set. We're good to go

2013
03:35:28,440 --> 03:35:33,399
Okay, I should get a shield at some point. There were people selling them in the round table the crash hold

2014
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:38,959
Lower health lesson the horse one has way more magic shit. Yeah

2015
03:36:00,719 --> 03:36:02,879
You gotta be fucking kidding me. How did I not?

2016
03:36:03,760 --> 03:36:14,200
Just when did they stop?

2017
03:36:17,059 --> 03:36:18,340
Dude

2018
03:36:18,340 --> 03:36:20,340
Everything he does is just like staggered

2019
03:36:53,110 --> 03:36:54,069
Oh

2020
03:36:54,069 --> 03:36:56,309
That's not good for you

2021
03:36:56,309 --> 03:36:59,510
All right, I hit the thing by accident. I was way off of it. That's all right

2022
03:37:12,020 --> 03:37:19,120
What is it what

2023
03:37:19,360 --> 03:37:21,360
I just keep hearing you scream

2024
03:37:22,799 --> 03:37:26,319
I've been perma combo for like the last minute. All right, we're gonna say sorry. Sorry

2025
03:37:37,879 --> 03:37:42,149
What the fuck just happened?

2026
03:37:42,149 --> 03:37:44,149
Dude, that shit threw me off big time

2027
03:37:55,700 --> 03:38:08,049
Oh, hey, he runs like four times. Okay, you got this man

2028
03:38:24,799 --> 03:38:30,950
What are you talking about?

2029
03:38:30,950 --> 03:38:35,510
Little fucking mr. Six flask over here. Stop it. This is not the time to make this joke

2030
03:38:55,459 --> 03:38:57,459
Stop

2031
03:38:58,899 --> 03:39:00,899
You're gonna make me lose

2032
03:39:00,899 --> 03:39:04,770
Ooh

2033
03:39:04,770 --> 03:39:18,680
I got I got a shield. I got millennia's armor. Cool. Woof. All right

2034
03:39:18,680 --> 03:39:23,829
Well, we got literally no help at all. That does not do anything for either one of us

2035
03:39:23,989 --> 03:39:29,540
We are still at the same exact place we were before fighting the worm. Um, so cool. Well, you got some souls

2036
03:39:31,270 --> 03:39:40,100
That's true. Need you to rest. Oh, okay. Where's the where's the bonfire?

2037
03:39:40,340 --> 03:39:56,739
Is it not just right here? It's at the bottom of the elevator, bro. I almost just walked off to get there, bro

2038
03:40:09,139 --> 03:40:13,799
Let's go to where the uh elixir is good idea

2039
03:40:17,809 --> 03:40:24,239
And then I also gave that guy the the grave root so we can go to uh, talk to beast boy

2040
03:40:24,559 --> 03:40:33,680
I think he gives you an item. You know what I mean? The teleporter that's sitting in the bush. Oh

2041
03:40:34,079 --> 03:40:36,799
That's right next to the where we're going. Anyway, ooh

2042
03:40:37,969 --> 03:40:45,969
Yeah, you like that. Can you just repeat everything you just said? I wasn't listening. Um

2043
03:40:46,530 --> 03:40:59,829
I don't know where the church is where you get the elixir. You remember where it is. I can't find it on the map

2044
03:40:59,989 --> 03:41:05,989
You're talking about you talk about the the the drink where oh you can do like a damage mitigation or you know, explode yourself

2045
03:41:06,549 --> 03:41:12,309
Yeah, where is that? It's not here, right? It's like, uh

2046
03:41:18,840 --> 03:41:26,930
Let's uh teleport to artist shack. I think you have that I was gonna say I think it's over here east of the lake

2047
03:41:27,829 --> 03:41:35,079
East side of limb grave artist. Can you can we vote? Can we vote? I just tried to do it

2048
03:41:37,299 --> 03:41:51,959
I think this would do hit lb. I think that should accept it immediately. Can I not teleport because i'm inside the cave?

2049
03:41:52,600 --> 03:41:55,719
Uh, let's just get out of the yeah, maybe should I get out of the cave?

2050
03:41:57,170 --> 03:42:03,520
I mean I spawned like at the bottom of it. Oh, maybe i'm gonna get out you have to leave

2051
03:42:27,729 --> 03:42:40,920
You think yourself an elden lord you are nothing underneath my boots which boss says that um, what just happened?

2052
03:42:42,930 --> 03:42:48,819
Did you are you teleporting teleporting to the start of the dungeon from the bottom of the dungeon i'm i'm outside right now

2053
03:42:49,360 --> 03:42:51,360
Okay, i'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming

2054
03:42:53,079 --> 03:42:56,579
Or artist shack unless you want to try this dragon

2055
03:42:58,639 --> 03:43:04,239
The big one over here the scary one. Yeah, I mean do you want to just die for a joke?

2056
03:43:04,559 --> 03:43:11,459
Okay, let's go do a joke. I I believe he should have really low health scaling because he's like a loser, right?

2057
03:43:12,100 --> 03:43:18,520
I mean, I maybe it sounds like accurate as long as like we don't get aggro'd by his whole like crew

2058
03:43:19,409 --> 03:43:24,520
I mean, he's sitting on top of it. Well, he's gone. We beat him. It was easy. He's gonna fly in I just

2059
03:43:33,030 --> 03:43:41,670
Yeah, I don't even know where i'm going

2060
03:43:41,670 --> 03:43:52,500
No, yeah, you gotta get off the horse that one shot me there man. I mean, it's definitely doable

2061
03:43:54,930 --> 03:43:58,639
It just you just lay down

2062
03:44:02,000 --> 03:44:09,159
Uh where he's back. All right, are you uh, just respawning or should I just die?

2063
03:44:09,799 --> 03:44:13,170
I just respawn

2064
03:44:13,170 --> 03:44:15,489
Do you want to fight him or do you want to um?

2065
03:44:16,629 --> 03:44:21,139
Something does not look right

2066
03:44:21,139 --> 03:45:02,600
Let's just get out of here gets we go this way he thinks you get the map fragment down here, too

2067
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:38,239
Okay, you were just flying through the air. Look like you were on a broomstick. So you want to go

2068
03:45:42,930 --> 03:45:44,930
Okay, there's uh

2069
03:45:47,190 --> 03:45:53,399
Yeah, you marked it. Oh, no, I I see it on the map. I'm going to it. Okay, that's just straight this way

2070
03:45:54,479 --> 03:46:04,069
Oh, here's kenneth height. I want to see what he's wearing

2071
03:46:05,989 --> 03:46:25,829
A little bit of a little little fashionista there, huh? He got the latest fall trend. Yeah, she looks all right. He looks all right

2072
03:46:31,159 --> 03:46:34,040
smithing stone one flask of wondrous busy

2073
03:46:35,680 --> 03:46:37,680
Kill him. No

2074
03:46:40,100 --> 03:46:42,180
I'm not wow. You want me to kill kenneth height?

2075
03:46:43,350 --> 03:46:44,479
he's

2076
03:46:44,479 --> 03:46:49,200
One spoiler alert spoiler alert spoilers for this is the spoiler of the entire game

2077
03:46:50,020 --> 03:46:52,659
Kenneth height is one of the only npcs that lives through the whole game

2078
03:46:53,299 --> 03:47:00,040
I mean like pretty he's pretty fucking sick. Don't you think?

2079
03:47:00,760 --> 03:47:02,120
Not in my game

2080
03:47:02,120 --> 03:47:05,000
Because you probably backstabbed him for fun

2081
03:47:05,239 --> 03:47:10,229
Well, didn't his like quest line not finish when the game came out?

2082
03:47:10,950 --> 03:47:16,149
I think that's why he stayed alive because they didn't finish his like whole arc. Oh, well, that's also why I killed him

2083
03:47:16,709 --> 03:47:23,270
You coming down here? Yeah, I didn't want to die a bunch of places to fall. I want to pete real quick

2084
03:47:24,069 --> 03:47:25,829
Uh spoiler is over. Yes

2085
03:47:25,829 --> 03:47:53,510
Okay, stop acting weird. It's not fun

2086
03:48:06,639 --> 03:48:20,959
It is here. You're right for a second. I thought I wasn't gonna be there. Do we even have anything?

2087
03:48:21,600 --> 03:48:24,290
The only thing I have I guess i'll put it on

2088
03:48:24,530 --> 03:48:32,840
Do I have any of the items that should be on this menu here?

2089
03:48:33,479 --> 03:48:51,329
They miss old germa old germa was weirder than this one. What if anything?

2090
03:48:51,329 --> 03:48:53,649
I've dialed back how fucking weird of a person I am

2091
03:48:54,370 --> 03:48:59,170
Wait, what we're dialing back how weird we are. Somebody said stop being weird. I was like, what do you mean?

2092
03:49:00,399 --> 03:49:02,000
we're super normal

2093
03:49:02,000 --> 03:49:08,719
we're going in the

2094
03:49:08,719 --> 03:49:13,459
the stargate

2095
03:49:14,100 --> 03:49:18,549
Kenneth pike

2096
03:49:18,549 --> 03:49:19,430
Oh

2097
03:49:19,430 --> 03:49:20,629

2098
03:49:20,629 --> 03:49:35,600
Grant me sucker

2099
03:49:35,680 --> 03:49:44,370
Oh tree that really is bugleberry. Oh tree the fuck there's a boat here. He's sucker please

2100
03:49:44,850 --> 03:49:49,079
Yeah, it is. You're right. Oh, yeah

2101
03:49:49,239 --> 03:50:06,129
You're giving death root

2102
03:50:06,450 --> 03:50:09,969
Yeah

2103
03:50:09,969 --> 03:50:14,100
Feed it me it me strong feed it me feed me more

2104
03:50:14,739 --> 03:50:19,780
Okay, I got like not much. Whoa, what did I get?

2105
03:50:20,709 --> 03:50:25,750
Oh, wow, do you ever got something cool again? I did I got a golden run

2106
03:50:30,600 --> 03:50:31,959
um

2107
03:50:31,959 --> 03:50:36,899
I think the scaling probably makes this boat have a lot of health. Oh, wait the boat's out here

2108
03:50:38,770 --> 03:50:39,729
Yeah

2109
03:50:39,729 --> 03:50:41,729
black blade mariner

2110
03:50:45,799 --> 03:50:47,959
But this guy sucks though, it shouldn't be too bad

2111
03:50:49,840 --> 03:50:51,840
Holy shit. Never mind

2112
03:50:59,030 --> 03:51:02,229
He's gonna aggro some like crazy enemy. That's probably near here

2113
03:51:12,049 --> 03:51:16,239
What the fuck?

2114
03:51:16,239 --> 03:51:17,760
What just happened to you?

2115
03:51:17,760 --> 03:51:20,360
I got crushed

2116
03:51:20,360 --> 03:51:22,360
Weird I didn't see anything hit you. You just died

2117
03:51:26,479 --> 03:51:28,559
It summons the gigantic skeleton hands

2118
03:51:29,280 --> 03:51:30,159
Yeah

2119
03:51:30,159 --> 03:51:33,649
Yeah, so this is the hard one that has way too much health

2120
03:51:34,209 --> 03:51:42,879
I tried to revive you did it work? Yep. Come back

2121
03:51:43,600 --> 03:51:48,079
All right, let's let's go down this road because there's also one of those trees and if you're actually getting golden seeds from them

2122
03:51:48,950 --> 03:51:51,110
Then there should be another golden seed here for you

2123
03:51:52,690 --> 03:51:56,639
um

2124
03:51:56,639 --> 03:51:59,510
Where are you talking about straight down the road?

2125
03:52:00,979 --> 03:52:02,819
Straight down the road

2126
03:52:02,819 --> 03:52:06,950
Where are you? Did you respawn at the where we were just fighting that guy? No

2127
03:52:08,000 --> 03:52:09,479
Oh

2128
03:52:09,479 --> 03:52:17,120
Uh, that was up here, right? He's still yeah, the beast will sanctum. I think you have to vote for it

2129
03:52:17,760 --> 03:52:19,760
How do I do the quick vote?

2130
03:52:19,760 --> 03:52:21,760
Left bumper I think

2131
03:52:23,879 --> 03:52:27,010
It's not it's guard

2132
03:52:27,170 --> 03:52:33,510
Can you do it now?

2133
03:52:33,510 --> 03:52:43,670
No, i'm in combat the viewers are all coming back

2134
03:52:44,959 --> 03:52:47,139
Oh shit, they are. What's up?

2135
03:52:47,139 --> 03:52:50,020
Yo, what up? What up gamers? Uh, let's go somewhere different

2136
03:52:50,819 --> 03:52:57,010
Go somewhere different. Okay. Well, I don't know if you want to go back to fighting market

2137
03:52:57,889 --> 03:53:00,049
I think I think we should

2138
03:53:01,159 --> 03:53:04,760
There's like a million different catacombs we can do but okay. Here's what we're gonna do

2139
03:53:05,399 --> 03:53:07,399
Let's go get the map fragment here

2140
03:53:07,639 --> 03:53:15,909
So let's teleport to the mist wood outskirts right in the middle. Let's get the map fragment

2141
03:53:16,549 --> 03:53:24,399
Okay, get the map fragment

2142
03:53:25,200 --> 03:53:34,100
Take off my runes

2143
03:53:34,260 --> 03:53:38,420
Oh shit, I need to go get my runes from the stupid. Yeah

2144
03:53:39,920 --> 03:53:41,420
My money were there

2145
03:53:41,420 --> 03:53:56,129
3000 dude, you're like level 40 3000 runes isn't a lot. Yeah, okay. Who cares? Let's go. I can't get you on the horse

2146
03:53:57,159 --> 03:53:59,329
I can't get on my horse

2147
03:53:59,329 --> 03:54:01,430
move

2148
03:54:01,430 --> 03:54:06,399
move legs

2149
03:54:06,399 --> 03:54:07,280
Okay

2150
03:54:07,280 --> 03:54:11,200
Looks like i'm just walking. Oh, I found dragon fire

2151
03:54:13,600 --> 03:54:17,280
And if I find like a somber stone one, I think I can like fully upgrade a weapon

2152
03:54:18,790 --> 03:54:20,959
You got any somber stone ones?

2153
03:54:20,959 --> 03:54:23,719
I think I actually do

2154
03:54:23,719 --> 03:54:28,770
I have two somber stone ones you can have them. Yo, come here. This is the play

2155
03:54:29,489 --> 03:54:39,719
It's gonna take me a minute because my horse doesn't work. Oh, no, I would only get a plus two

2156
03:54:40,280 --> 03:54:45,170
It's not that important are these random

2157
03:54:53,700 --> 03:54:54,979
so

2158
03:54:54,979 --> 03:54:58,049
You need that stone

2159
03:54:58,049 --> 03:55:05,620
Now let's go down here because there's a bajillion items as you just run along the river, right?

2160
03:55:06,020 --> 03:55:08,340
Oh, wait, this is yeah, this is underground when you go

2161
03:55:08,979 --> 03:55:14,280
Like all the this is where that boss was supposed to be right the uh, the elk or whatever it is

2162
03:55:15,159 --> 03:55:16,040
Yeah

2163
03:55:16,040 --> 03:55:19,409
Somewhere way down here after you light all the bonfire thingies

2164
03:55:21,840 --> 03:55:24,069
so um

2165
03:55:24,069 --> 03:55:26,469
Little tail because we're on the long elevator yesterday

2166
03:55:26,469 --> 03:55:30,389
I went out with a bunch of people and we went to a place around here called pinballs

2167
03:55:30,469 --> 03:55:31,510
I don't know if it's a texas thing

2168
03:55:31,510 --> 03:55:34,790
That's like, you know pinball arcade has a whole bunch like the goofy arcade stuff here

2169
03:55:34,870 --> 03:55:39,590
And it had one of those punch machines where like the the punch thing comes down and you punch it

2170
03:55:39,590 --> 03:55:41,670
You get like a score for how hard you hit it. Yeah

2171
03:55:42,290 --> 03:55:45,489
So like everyone in the whole group like 12 people we're all doing it. We're having a good time

2172
03:55:45,809 --> 03:55:49,489
There was like, oh shit like oh you did better. Oh, like I did better and then like this dude comes over

2173
03:55:49,729 --> 03:55:53,569
Super drunk is like yeah, I I do like mma dude like hey guys. What's up?

2174
03:55:53,569 --> 03:55:54,930
This is my name. How's it going?

2175
03:55:54,930 --> 03:55:57,250
And he like did it to like show off in front of everyone

2176
03:55:58,399 --> 03:56:00,399
And apparently like later I saw him all night

2177
03:56:00,399 --> 03:56:05,360
like he was watching people drunk like just sitting in a chair that could have view of that anytime anyone went over there he like

2178
03:56:05,920 --> 03:56:09,750
Asserted himself and like his whole identity was punching this thing

2179
03:56:11,159 --> 03:56:14,040
Uh, it was really weird and then I went and I beat his punch

2180
03:56:14,520 --> 03:56:16,530
Oh, no

2181
03:56:16,530 --> 03:56:19,969
So he came back up to me later and was like, oh, yeah, dude

2182
03:56:20,049 --> 03:56:20,850
Oh, yeah

2183
03:56:20,850 --> 03:56:23,649
like like telling me like all this like martial arts stuff and like

2184
03:56:24,129 --> 03:56:27,889
Trying to like I don't know like the weirdest down speak to me of like yeah

2185
03:56:28,209 --> 03:56:30,930
You got this is how you actually you got to do it. Like this is a proper punch

2186
03:56:31,010 --> 03:56:33,889
You learn this, you know doing mma for like five years, man

2187
03:56:37,399 --> 03:56:40,950
And you just you what what was your score, uh

2188
03:56:43,090 --> 03:56:47,680
900 something yeah, I was gonna say I can get that fucking thing to 900

2189
03:56:47,840 --> 03:56:49,360
I could tell you I could like show you how to do it

2190
03:56:49,360 --> 03:56:52,209
If uh, if we if you and I get there like if we're at a thing

2191
03:56:52,290 --> 03:56:55,409
I could probably teach you like the right way to do it because I can do probably like nine

2192
03:56:56,129 --> 03:57:01,799
50 or so I notoriously know how to do that very well. I could show you what's the proper technique

I'm dead. I'm poisoned. I'm dead

2253
04:02:06,149 --> 04:02:13,569
Are you dead for real for real? No, I'm like dead dead. Is it respawning you?

2254
04:02:14,920 --> 04:02:16,040

2255
04:02:16,040 --> 04:02:21,250
I think so. Yeah, you l2 multiple times. I will

2256
04:02:21,889 --> 04:02:24,479
Oh, I am so far away now

2257
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:27,440
What?

2258
04:02:27,440 --> 04:02:32,709
Oh no

2259
04:02:32,709 --> 04:02:35,360
I'm fuming

2260
04:02:35,360 --> 04:02:42,280
why

2261
04:02:42,280 --> 04:02:44,600
I'm gonna die too because i'm poisoned what's going on

2262
04:02:47,600 --> 04:02:52,719
What his I thought that was you who the fuck is that? I don't know somebody I can hear somebody on my screen

2263
04:02:53,200 --> 04:02:58,000
It's like a naked dude where you died that looked kind of like you with a sword

2264
04:02:59,040 --> 04:03:01,440
I still can't use the horse. We're gonna have to reset probably

2265
04:03:03,040 --> 04:03:06,479
Hold on. I think when I get to the bonfire I can we can resolve this

2266
04:03:21,670 --> 04:03:24,340
Okay, I vote it to travel if you can

2267
04:03:25,399 --> 04:03:27,399
Uh, I I don't have that bonfire

2268
04:03:28,709 --> 04:03:30,950
You know, that's why you spawn so far away. You never touched it

2269
04:03:31,030 --> 04:03:31,430
Yeah

2270
04:03:31,430 --> 04:03:36,870
Well, I didn't have the horse and it was irritating me and you started talking about some guy punching stuff and you punching him or something

2271
04:03:39,079 --> 04:03:40,680
You punch the thing

2272
04:03:40,680 --> 04:03:42,950
Yeah punch the thing

2273
04:03:42,950 --> 04:03:45,430
And then the guy came over and told me he can punch things better

2274
04:03:46,069 --> 04:03:52,479
I'm right there

2275
04:03:52,479 --> 04:03:56,159
Wait, you forgot to put the map underground. Oh that wait. Wait. Wait, there is true, right?

2276
04:03:58,690 --> 04:04:08,719
Oh, that is true. Okay, I can I can travel there. I forgot that that existed. Can you um warp with me?

2277
04:04:08,799 --> 04:04:10,399
So I can just get down there

2278
04:04:10,399 --> 04:04:13,250
I want to figure out what this left bumper thing is. It doesn't

2279
04:04:14,209 --> 04:04:23,700
Do anything because you and the horse died simultaneously to the skeleton reset

2280
04:04:26,680 --> 04:04:28,680
Okay, so where's that thing?

2281
04:04:28,920 --> 04:04:34,360
You start with it was like a cool jump to get jump. Okay horse up. I don't have a horse

2282
04:04:34,840 --> 04:04:37,620
Do I need it?

2283
04:04:37,620 --> 04:04:42,659
Why don't you have a horse because it glitched out at me and the horse died at the exact same time in the same frame

2284
04:04:42,979 --> 04:04:44,840
So it broke my game

2285
04:04:44,840 --> 04:04:46,370
one use

2286
04:04:46,370 --> 04:04:49,159
Can I make the jump aside?

2287
04:04:49,159 --> 04:04:54,260
Uh, I actually don't think you can do this without it. Yeah, we'll do something else then we're good. Yeah

2288
04:04:57,959 --> 04:05:01,159
I mean should I

2289
04:05:01,159 --> 04:05:02,840
You're you coming?

2290
04:05:02,840 --> 04:05:09,809
Yeah, it just takes me an extra second

2291
04:05:09,889 --> 04:05:11,569
You look kind of cool now

2292
04:05:11,569 --> 04:05:13,729
Yeah, like i've got like a shirt I can wear

2293
04:05:19,170 --> 04:05:24,209
Man, i'm so fast on this little donkey. How many hours do I spend in a tanning bed a week?

2294
04:05:26,149 --> 04:05:28,549
I I have a story

2295
04:05:28,549 --> 04:05:29,680
so

2296
04:05:29,680 --> 04:05:31,680
before like pax east

2297
04:05:33,329 --> 04:05:37,700
2014 or 2015 or something. There's like almost 10 years ago now. I

2298
04:05:38,639 --> 04:05:42,159
You know as a gamer right and it's like as a gamer

2299
04:05:42,879 --> 04:05:47,120
I didn't really go out that much during the summer at one at this point

2300
04:05:47,520 --> 04:05:49,840
I was like doing youtube videos and all this stuff, right?

2301
04:05:50,879 --> 04:05:52,879
So I was really pale

2302
04:05:52,879 --> 04:05:57,280
And I was like, oh there's gonna be a bunch of youtubers and there's other people there a bunch of people in the industry

2303
04:05:58,319 --> 04:06:00,719
So I I didn't want to be freaking pale

2304
04:06:01,649 --> 04:06:04,610
so I went to a tanning salon

2305
04:06:05,780 --> 04:06:10,420
and I went one time and the people behind the counter were just like

2306
04:06:11,139 --> 04:06:13,379
You know, this is not really gonna do anything and i'm like, yeah

2307
04:06:13,459 --> 04:06:17,219
But like even if it does something at all just a little so I get like a little bit of color

2308
04:06:18,069 --> 04:06:20,069
It didn't do I don't think it really did anything

2309
04:06:20,549 --> 04:06:26,879
I just went into tanning bed for like 30 or 40 minutes do anything if you do it once you have

2310
04:06:27,040 --> 04:06:29,600
Apparently you have to do it like at least a couple of times

2311
04:06:30,790 --> 04:06:32,790
Otherwise, it's like it doesn't it doesn't really do much

2312
04:06:33,590 --> 04:06:36,790
So I went to a tanning salon hound's fang

2313
04:06:37,680 --> 04:06:39,989
Ooh

2314
04:06:39,989 --> 04:06:42,870
You want one of those wanted your third trade?

2315
04:06:43,670 --> 04:06:45,989
Every time an item comes up. No, i'm good

2316
04:06:47,329 --> 04:06:49,329
So I I went to a tanning bed one time

2317
04:06:49,889 --> 04:06:52,850
And it was I don't know. This is weird. I didn't like it. Did you just sit there?

2318
04:06:52,850 --> 04:06:54,850
And it's like and the whole time i'm sitting there thinking

2319
04:06:56,260 --> 04:06:58,260
I don't this is probably like bad

2320
04:06:59,540 --> 04:07:01,540
You're just laying there like real like

2321
04:07:01,780 --> 04:07:05,459
I don't actually need this but I so badly just didn't want to I like I feel like

2322
04:07:06,180 --> 04:07:11,219
I don't know like oh i'm gonna be going in like this like people I may be meeting up with are talking to people

2323
04:07:11,620 --> 04:07:13,620
Oh, wait, what if I do like a meetup?

2324
04:07:14,020 --> 04:07:18,899
I wanted I don't know. I would like oh hey, man, I get a lot of sun. I'm everything's good on this end

2325
04:07:19,459 --> 04:07:21,459
it'd be funnier if like

2326
04:07:22,559 --> 04:07:24,559
it worked too well and you had like the

2327
04:07:25,040 --> 04:07:26,879
I was just like circle art things and

2328
04:07:27,440 --> 04:07:28,319
Yeah

2329
04:07:28,319 --> 04:07:33,840
Like super burnt and like you very obviously you have just you were just in a tanning

2330
04:07:35,280 --> 04:07:39,989
You look weird like I don't I don't get those things. That's that is the whole thing is weird to me

2331
04:07:40,229 --> 04:07:42,229
Why didn't you just go outside?

2332
04:07:42,309 --> 04:07:45,030
Because it was it wasn't I couldn't get sun

2333
04:07:45,750 --> 04:07:49,030
It was like I don't know what pax it was it was like pax east or pax prime

2334
04:07:49,030 --> 04:07:51,270
It was one of them it wasn't in like the summer

2335
04:07:52,979 --> 04:07:58,100
Yeah, pax pax east was always like really shitty weather winter. It was like february march or sunday, right?

2336
04:07:58,819 --> 04:08:02,579
Yeah, it was like may march, but it was still

2337
04:08:03,459 --> 04:08:06,579
We do the weather

2338
04:08:06,579 --> 04:08:12,340
I i'm so jealous of you being able to be on a horse like even with you resting

2339
04:08:12,340 --> 04:08:17,969
You're not getting your horse back. I don't think so. I know where's the bonfire up here. Did we get it?

2340
04:08:18,209 --> 04:08:25,760
Where are you? Why did you want to tan in winter?

2341
04:08:26,479 --> 04:08:28,479
I didn't want to tan. I just wanted to look

2342
04:08:29,590 --> 04:08:33,750
Like oh man, yeah, I go outside. I've i've gotten a little bit of sun

2343
04:08:34,469 --> 04:08:36,469
i'm healthy

2344
04:08:36,709 --> 04:08:41,090
dude

2345
04:08:41,090 --> 04:08:45,889
Trying to show off somebody said I haven't actually rested at a bonfire in like a half an hour really

2346
04:08:48,000 --> 04:08:51,440
Yeah, it's you definitely don't have your horse and you just need to rest at a bonfire

2347
04:08:52,399 --> 04:09:04,020
I thought there was one over here or is it in the next area right here? I think take a seat

2348
04:09:04,340 --> 04:09:12,239
I'm pretty sure I already did this take a seat. I did it already call your horse. Nope

2349
04:09:14,899 --> 04:09:16,899
What is it's like summoning it but not

2350
04:09:17,840 --> 04:09:23,219
I think i'm seeing it and then it disappears. Do you want to load a different zone or something?

2351
04:09:24,229 --> 04:09:28,309
Um, I think it's just bugged. Uh, we could you want to just read?

2352
04:09:29,190 --> 04:09:31,190
Want me to just leave come back or something?

2353
04:09:31,590 --> 04:09:36,790
I'll just disconnect and come back. I just mean like teleport to a new area

2354
04:09:37,110 --> 04:09:40,069
I I mean I have teleported a couple. Yeah, I I guess you could

2355
04:09:40,790 --> 04:09:42,790

2356
04:09:46,319 --> 04:09:48,319
What's going on? Oh, they're going

2357
04:09:56,000 --> 04:10:12,440

2358
04:10:12,440 --> 04:10:14,479
Okay

2359
04:10:14,479 --> 04:10:20,180
Let me make sure this worked

2360
04:10:20,180 --> 04:10:24,819
Yeah, we haven't even taken a break. Have we we haven't like really walked away for any like any amount of time. Have we?

2361
04:10:25,379 --> 04:10:26,899
I did a pp

2362
04:10:26,899 --> 04:10:28,979
Okay, that fixed it

2363
04:10:28,979 --> 04:10:30,979
It did fix it. It was a big pp

2364
04:10:31,139 --> 04:10:32,420
Yo, what?

2365
04:10:32,420 --> 04:10:47,969
Okay, I figured if you join my world, do you just appear where I am?

2366
04:10:48,690 --> 04:10:52,420
That's a good question. Let's find out can you put down a thing?

2367
04:10:54,040 --> 04:10:56,040

2368
04:10:56,920 --> 04:10:58,520
Oh my

2369
04:10:58,520 --> 04:11:03,879
Is your thing doesn't matter if your thing's down where doesn't matter where I think it is already active because of before

2370
04:11:05,270 --> 04:11:11,040
Uh, let's see if it works. I may need to do the disconnect thing

2371
04:11:12,260 --> 04:11:17,860
Yeah, I got the horse back

2372
04:11:17,860 --> 04:11:19,139

04:11:20,870 --> 04:11:24,209
I cannot I cannot join your world. Okay. Let me

2375
04:11:25,250 --> 04:11:26,450
Reset it

2376
04:11:26,450 --> 04:11:35,219
You get all your wisdom teeth taken out

2377
04:11:35,219 --> 04:11:37,459
I'll make sure you down again. Make sure you're just chilling out

2378
04:11:41,040 --> 04:11:43,040
What why are you asking about wisdom teeth?

2379
04:11:43,360 --> 04:11:45,959
I'm just talking to somebody

2380
04:11:45,959 --> 04:11:47,639
Oh, okay

2381
04:11:47,639 --> 04:11:58,049

Where are you going? What the fuck you're like glitching everywhere

04:12:13,559 --> 04:12:15,559
All right, let's continue

2386
04:12:20,260 --> 04:12:22,899
I don't see where you're like something's weird. Yeah

2387
04:12:23,700 --> 04:12:25,700
Oh, I got a glenstone staff if you want it

2388
04:12:26,920 --> 04:12:28,920
I think it doesn't like this area very much

2389
04:12:32,920 --> 04:12:37,780
You know what? I will take the glenstone staff as one of my one things

2390
04:12:38,579 --> 04:12:55,520
That's a lot of runes. I think you've synced up. I see you moving around now. I should just buy this just to have it

2391
04:12:55,600 --> 04:12:57,600
Oh golden seed

Uh, how do I drop it?

2398
04:13:25,329 --> 04:13:32,370
Uh, you go into your inventory not your equipment you find it and you do leave on it not discard discarding. It's bad leaving. It's good

2399
04:13:33,809 --> 04:13:36,930

04:15:22,770 --> 04:15:30,319
Okay. Oh boy

2419
04:15:31,040 --> 04:15:34,159

2420
04:15:34,959 --> 04:15:59,440
Okay, where are we going?

2421
04:15:59,440 --> 04:16:03,159

2422
04:16:05,879 --> 04:16:07,879

Sorry, I got the werewolf gun on my screen

2425
04:16:34,930 --> 04:16:46,260
That was kind of scary to just see you hanging. I thought you killed yourself. Okay

2426
04:16:47,409 --> 04:16:50,690
Wait, okay before we do anything. I have another

2427
04:16:51,799 --> 04:16:58,020
Golden seed I have seven flasks dude. You only have three

I've got four now because I switched the one mana

2429
04:17:03,639 --> 04:17:05,639
But yeah pretty much it's time to do this

2430
04:17:09,649 --> 04:17:14,850
No more messing around. This is the one we are we're ready. We're prepared. We're fresh. We've leveled up

2431
04:17:15,489 --> 04:17:18,159
It's coming back. It's coming back

2432
04:17:18,159 --> 04:17:23,280
And he hit me on the opposite side of him. Don't it's just once you start complaining. That's when you lose your gamer skills

2433
04:17:24,079 --> 04:17:30,290
Something's wrong with them. Something is wrong with this guy

2434
04:17:49,719 --> 04:17:53,680
Nice nice

2435
04:18:08,520 --> 04:18:16,770

04:18:17,329 --> 04:18:21,190
Okay

2437
04:18:21,190 --> 04:18:22,799
Okay

2438
04:18:22,799 --> 04:18:24,159
Get behind him

2439
04:18:24,159 --> 04:18:28,100
As he starts putting a lot on his blade. We can just keep hitting him

2440
04:18:32,399 --> 04:18:34,639
But don't be too cocky about it. Here he comes

2441
04:18:35,280 --> 04:18:41,360
Hey, yeah, just run away from the big slam

2442
04:18:53,040 --> 04:18:55,780
Dude, bro. My game is having problems

2443
04:18:56,500 --> 04:18:58,280
He's gonna slap

2444
04:18:58,280 --> 04:19:00,280
Dude, he keeps freezing

2445
04:19:00,840 --> 04:19:26,229
This is the run dude. I'm going to heck. Yes

2446
04:19:27,129 --> 04:19:33,909
Oh heck. Yes

2447
04:19:33,909 --> 04:19:35,909

I'm going easy

2452
04:20:39,159 --> 04:20:46,280
He's probably gonna do the spin

2453
04:20:46,280 --> 04:20:49,100
Is this easy mode?

2454
04:20:49,180 --> 04:20:51,770
That's it. Yes

2455
04:20:51,770 --> 04:20:54,090
We got through the uh, we got through the wall

2456
04:20:56,629 --> 04:20:59,829
I you're gonna be really mad about this, but I just got another golden seed

2457
04:20:59,909 --> 04:21:04,709
I got two golden seeds and the halic tree left medallion. Oh, okay

2458
04:21:05,270 --> 04:21:07,049
So i'm caught up

2459
04:21:07,049 --> 04:21:09,049
catching up two seeds

2460
04:21:09,879 --> 04:21:13,540
Nice

2461
04:21:13,540 --> 04:21:15,860
That feels pretty good. And that's how you have twins

2462
04:21:21,540 --> 04:21:25,620
All right points. I need points in endurance. Why did I do this?

2463
04:21:33,270 --> 04:21:46,700
Decks, I think I need to do it. I think I have to two decks just do at least two decks

2464
04:21:48,500 --> 04:21:49,459
Okay

2465
04:21:49,459 --> 04:21:51,459
No, you know what? I can fix this right now

2466
04:21:51,540 --> 04:21:55,670
I'm gonna fix it right now

2467
04:21:55,670 --> 04:21:58,309
I have 40 000 souls now. Let's fix this

2468
04:21:59,510 --> 04:22:01,510
You fucking piece of shit

2469
04:22:03,110 --> 04:22:06,229
All right, I feel like i'm getting so many just like a handouts from the game

2470
04:22:06,870 --> 04:22:08,229
all right

2471
04:22:08,229 --> 04:22:10,229
Okay, this is big this fixes it

2472
04:22:13,000 --> 04:22:15,350
i'm thinking

2473
04:22:15,350 --> 04:22:16,850
like

2474
04:22:16,850 --> 04:22:19,670
15 12

2475
04:22:19,670 --> 04:22:20,969
15

2476
04:22:20,969 --> 04:22:32,170
or like 14

2477
04:22:32,409 --> 04:22:35,610
16 12 14

2478
04:22:35,610 --> 04:22:40,489
17

2479
04:22:40,489 --> 04:22:42,489
Like this are we okay? Is this gonna be all right?

2480
04:22:51,159 --> 04:22:52,520
Sure, whatever

2481
04:22:52,520 --> 04:22:54,280
all strength fuck it

2482
04:22:54,280 --> 04:22:55,909
16

2483
04:22:55,909 --> 04:23:00,969
16 12 14

2484
04:23:00,969 --> 04:23:04,409
Is 12 decks enough? I don't think it is. I'm an idiot

2485
04:23:05,559 --> 04:23:08,440
Leave decks at 12 leave decks at 12. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough

2486
04:23:10,709 --> 04:23:13,299
You're an idiot. Why?

2487
04:23:13,299 --> 04:23:18,979
I want to go to round table to upgrade my sword. I thought I couldn't do it as much but I can upgrade it like a lot more

2488
04:23:19,620 --> 04:23:23,540
12 is good, dude, dude 18 decks, please 14. I don't know

2489
04:23:26,170 --> 04:23:31,299
Check the weapons

2490
04:23:31,299 --> 04:23:34,899
Hold on. This is this is really important because i'm gonna be i'm not gonna be able to level up for like another

2491
04:23:35,379 --> 04:23:38,100
Four or five hours stir. I need to get this right

2492
04:23:39,829 --> 04:23:41,829
You're just gonna find like 10 more remembrances

2493
04:23:42,790 --> 04:23:45,030
You say that now but look at what you've had to deal with

2494
04:23:47,020 --> 04:23:50,569
Yeah, but that's me

2495
04:23:50,569 --> 04:23:54,170
I can use this

2496
04:23:54,170 --> 04:23:56,540
I can use this right now

2497
04:23:56,540 --> 04:23:59,180
This needs faith, but that doesn't matter. I can use this

2498
04:23:59,659 --> 04:24:03,370
This thing's pretty beefy

2499
04:24:03,370 --> 04:24:07,180
Use the pizza cutter

2500
04:24:07,180 --> 04:24:08,780
pizza cutter pizza cutter

2501
04:24:08,780 --> 04:24:12,329
18 ducks

2502
04:24:12,329 --> 04:24:16,329
Use the pizza cutter. All right, we need a poll because i'm sorry i'm gonna be like waste a bunch of time here

2503
04:24:16,889 --> 04:24:20,170
Do you want me to put enough points into decks to use the pizza cutter?

2504
04:24:21,370 --> 04:24:23,530
Because this is yeah, this is the decision we have to make

2505
04:24:24,420 --> 04:24:26,420
You're asking me

2506
04:24:26,420 --> 04:24:28,420
I mean you can contribute if you want

2507
04:24:29,379 --> 04:24:31,379
Oh, well, I don't care

2508
04:24:31,540 --> 04:24:37,559
But I wonder if they even shoot if there's

2509
04:24:40,569 --> 04:24:44,969
Pizza cutter sucks. It's dog shit. It's so bad. All right, I

2510
04:24:47,319 --> 04:24:48,760
What a bad idea

2511
04:24:48,760 --> 04:24:52,170
What do you want to do? I'll tell you what I want to do

2512
04:24:52,889 --> 04:24:56,409
Can we go do this at round table? Hold?

2513
04:24:56,569 --> 04:24:57,450
Yes

2514
04:24:57,450 --> 04:25:13,989
Did you say to go?

2515
04:25:13,989 --> 04:25:17,190
I did and then it says you already voted to warp here

2516
04:25:17,750 --> 04:25:22,069
You voted my map is frozen until like the timer runs out

2517
04:25:22,870 --> 04:25:35,139
Okay, it says it failed

2518
04:25:35,139 --> 04:25:39,899
Okay, don't do it again. Okay. I'm not doing it for me to do it might be like a weird host thing

2519
04:25:40,780 --> 04:25:46,659
All right

2520
04:25:46,659 --> 04:25:48,180
That's not

2521
04:25:48,180 --> 04:25:50,180
That's not a big majority

2522
04:25:50,420 --> 04:25:53,739
to vote it

2523
04:25:53,739 --> 04:25:58,260
That's not

2524
04:25:58,260 --> 04:26:00,739
That's 53. That's not that oh shit

2525
04:26:01,219 --> 04:26:02,340
but

2526
04:26:02,340 --> 04:26:03,989
on guard

2527
04:26:03,989 --> 04:26:08,149
Someone's in the round table. What's going on? This looks a little different man. Why does it look so different?

2528
04:26:08,229 --> 04:26:13,110
Actually, I have 40. I don't even have a weapon equipped. I have 40 000 souls right now. Please kill him

2529
04:26:28,579 --> 04:26:51,270
Bro, i'm trying. Thank god. I was about to shit my pants. Can we get a weapon? Can we get something?

2530
04:26:52,850 --> 04:26:56,200
Satisfaction, I thought you got his arm

2531
04:26:57,979 --> 04:27:01,020
Oh, it's over. It's over here. It's over here where he was standing

2532
04:27:04,600 --> 04:27:08,680
Good stuff. No one is standing anywhere where he used to be standing

2533
04:27:11,579 --> 04:27:17,020
No, my round table hold is empty. Oh minus two. The blacksmith is not there. You're not here. No npcs are here

2534
04:27:17,420 --> 04:27:21,219
Yeah, mine is gone, too

2535
04:27:21,219 --> 04:27:24,420
Okay. Now can we like teleport maybe we can do it now?

2536
04:27:34,760 --> 04:27:36,309
Yeah

2537
04:27:36,309 --> 04:27:37,270
this

2538
04:27:37,270 --> 04:27:39,270
Looks yes. I got an item

2539
04:27:42,389 --> 04:27:51,979
I do not nobody's in here. Uh, i'm not there's nobody here. Okay. Well you were just leveling right?

2540
04:27:52,620 --> 04:27:56,299
I just want to I need to blacksmith real quick. Yeah, I you you I

2541
04:27:56,780 --> 04:28:04,819
No blacksmith isn't here weird. Okay, so let's teleport out. Should we try again?

2542
04:28:16,309 --> 04:28:22,340
Uh omen killer is a mog type weapon. I think i'm going omen killer

2543
04:28:25,049 --> 04:28:33,180
I know that it was 53 but you're forgetting about the streamer vote. My vote is worth 5 and i'm going with the mog type weapon

2544
04:28:38,709 --> 04:28:40,090
I think

2545
04:28:40,090 --> 04:28:42,090
Our games are not synced

2546
04:28:42,649 --> 04:28:47,770
Yeah, i'm gonna dismiss i'm gonna like yeah, just use the get out of my world. Yeah, i'll use it right now

2547
04:28:48,250 --> 04:28:55,989
I almost feel like it'd be easier to like

2548
04:28:56,389 --> 04:29:01,190
Dismiss you from the world and then do round table hold we probably yeah, let's do that

2549
04:29:01,670 --> 04:29:05,110
I feel like we spend so much time trying to get there that we could have already just done it

2550
04:29:06,549 --> 04:29:11,829
So just do your thing and then when we're done upgrading then we'll be back up first chance we get we gotta find the uh,

2551
04:29:11,909 --> 04:29:15,110
The other blacksmith that we can use so we can avoid this as well

2552
04:29:21,829 --> 04:29:25,829
Yeah, I am playing as me strong. That's true. I can't go against the me strong

2553
04:29:26,729 --> 04:29:30,969
Uh build what does omen killer use in need?

2554
04:29:33,479 --> 04:29:35,479
Well, you have smithing stone too

2555
04:29:35,979 --> 04:29:40,069
Uh, I probably let's see I do

2556
04:29:41,979 --> 04:29:43,979
I have two smithing stone twos

2557
04:29:44,600 --> 04:29:48,200
Oh, well, you're probably gonna need them unless you're using a somber stone thing. Uh

2558
04:29:49,239 --> 04:29:55,270
What is that? What is the omen killer? Oh, this thing is pretty cool. I like it

2559
04:30:01,590 --> 04:30:11,239
This uses regular smithing stone. So I need it. Okay. Well, this causes blood loss. It does

2560
04:30:11,639 --> 04:30:26,500
Strength infuse it

2561
04:30:26,500 --> 04:30:33,739
Do I have that yet?

2562
04:30:33,739 --> 04:30:37,420
Uh, I don't really have um, I forgot. How do you sell things?

2563
04:30:38,120 --> 04:30:40,180
blacksmith

2564
04:30:40,180 --> 04:30:42,180
Blacksmith has a cell tab

2565
04:30:42,340 --> 04:30:49,770
All right. That being said let's go ahead and do this

2566
04:30:54,579 --> 04:31:03,020
Because I I need it so bad, right? I got i've got dex 12 dexterity. This is good

2567
04:31:05,799 --> 04:31:07,959
I gotta get my my vigor up and my endurance

2568
04:31:12,809 --> 04:31:13,850
Okay

2569
04:31:13,850 --> 04:31:23,000
much better

2570
04:31:23,479 --> 04:31:25,000
So

2571
04:31:25,000 --> 04:31:36,899
Now this is faith scaling

2572
04:31:36,899 --> 04:31:45,930
When are you gonna when's your guilty gear tournament?

2573
04:31:47,379 --> 04:31:49,379
Don't you they're asking you that?

2574
04:31:50,120 --> 04:31:54,040
Uh, I think they're just saying words directed at you in hopes that you'll read them

2575
04:32:02,309 --> 04:32:06,149
Oh, that's right. You can do that, right? Okay. I forgot you could do that

2576
04:32:06,850 --> 04:32:09,190
150 41 130 61

2577
04:32:21,030 --> 04:32:31,270
All right. I am now prepared. I'm completely ready. Can I level up one more time?

2578
04:32:32,229 --> 04:32:37,399
Okay, I thought I had more stuff than I thought I had but I didn't have the things I thought I had

2579
04:32:44,870 --> 04:32:46,870
I'm just selling the rune arc. I don't care

2580
04:32:54,940 --> 04:32:56,540
Go ahead and do that

2581
04:32:56,540 --> 04:32:59,530
Why not?

2582
04:32:59,530 --> 04:33:01,530
Actually, I thought there were a thousand not 200

2583
04:33:10,299 --> 04:33:15,380
Okay, where are we gonna meet up?

2584
04:33:15,380 --> 04:33:21,860
Uh, wherever you feel like uh, we can do the rest of the castle that we just unlocked. Let's do that

2585
04:33:23,369 --> 04:33:26,090
Oh, and I need to reinvent you to my world. So i'm gonna go back to

2586
04:33:26,729 --> 04:33:28,740
market

2587
04:33:28,740 --> 04:33:43,270
and invite

2588
04:33:43,270 --> 04:33:47,349
My seal is down. Uh, we could make sure you use the humanity before you try and reconnect

2589
04:33:47,909 --> 04:33:50,630
And i'm standing exactly over here if you can see find my son

2590
04:33:59,990 --> 04:34:03,430
Sell the pizza cutter. I might have sellers remorse if I do that

2591
04:34:06,500 --> 04:34:10,840
I need to make sure

2592
04:34:10,840 --> 04:34:12,840
7800 come on. I'm almost ready

2593

I peed

2596
04:34:23,240 --> 04:34:25,240
Peed for like three minutes straight

2597
04:34:28,020 --> 04:34:31,220
Uh, but there are also a lot of items here like at the gate castle

2598
04:34:31,779 --> 04:34:32,900
Yeah

2599
04:34:32,900 --> 04:34:36,740
Uh, and they're all scattered on the floor and you can just open up the main gate because there's no one manning the ballistas

2600
04:34:37,659 --> 04:34:44,650
That's pretty good. All right. I'm gonna take a quick pee break. I will be right back

2601
04:34:45,380 --> 04:34:51,560
Um, give me like two minutes. I might refill this drink to this water. I might get some more water

2602
04:34:52,549 --> 04:41:05,720
There was tea in here earlier, but i'm gonna replace it with water. I'll be right back. Oh, are you hello?

2603
04:41:07,080 --> 04:41:10,119
Oh my god, i'm, sorry everybody. Are you hello? Are you?

04:41:10,680 --> 04:41:12,680

2607
04:41:25,959 --> 04:41:48,619
Uh, can you use an afigi? Shut the f**k up. Remember just ate a fistful of edibles. I did not

2608
04:41:49,509 --> 04:42:00,150
All right. So I got my new weapon. What is the actual what is that? Oh wait, that's pretty cool

2609
04:42:00,549 --> 04:42:15,080
Looks like a holy buff. Yeah, I have all right attack power with successive attacks. He's fully ready

2610
04:42:16,099 --> 04:42:20,060
All right, let's go. Where are you? Oh, there are so many items here

2611
04:42:21,180 --> 04:42:34,860
Are we going right front door? Yeah

2612
04:42:34,939 --> 04:42:36,220
Did you grab all this shit?

2613
04:42:36,220 --> 04:42:40,970
I don't know if you want to go around and just do the other stuff and pick up items as well

2614
04:42:41,209 --> 04:42:48,580
We can do that. We should probably i'm more used to that route. Yeah, I got golden

2615
04:42:49,750 --> 04:42:52,299
Kill him kill him

2616
04:42:52,299 --> 04:42:57,029
Oh kill him. No, i'm kidding. Don't you should because he steals souls from you. What?

2617
04:43:09,560 --> 04:43:10,520
Yeah

2618
04:43:10,520 --> 04:43:15,959
Did you get his ball bearing?

2619
04:43:15,959 --> 04:43:17,400
Yeah

2620
04:43:17,400 --> 04:43:21,159
Which is good if you take that to the you know, the the shop ladies the maidens

2621
04:43:21,639 --> 04:43:25,560
Then his shop is still randomized at them, but you do miss out on

2622
04:43:26,119 --> 04:43:28,840
The what is it the last smithing stone available?

2623
04:43:31,450 --> 04:43:33,049
I don't know if that was a good idea

2624
04:43:33,049 --> 04:43:35,819
It was a great idea

2625
04:43:35,819 --> 04:43:41,029
What last smithing stone his store has the last like dragon smithing stone in it at the end of the game

2626
04:43:42,180 --> 04:43:50,330
His shit's all randomized. Yeah, but I mean in like the regular playthrough not in this one. Okay

2627
04:43:50,810 --> 04:43:56,979
I'm just saying that's is this a regular playthrough right now? No, i'm gonna saying in jet and regular playthrough. You don't

2628
04:43:57,700 --> 04:44:05,659
He stays around. Well, well actually like for real right now, dude, you're not gonna make it to the end game

2629
04:44:07,560 --> 04:44:16,020
We might not but whatever smithing stone three

2630
04:44:17,849 --> 04:44:19,849
No, demi human mobs

2631
04:44:23,430 --> 04:44:24,310
What?

2632
04:44:24,310 --> 04:44:39,029
This thing's pretty good

2633
04:44:39,029 --> 04:44:53,459
Reeves

2634
04:44:53,459 --> 04:44:59,860
Epic that guy was strong. So wait, sorry is this cutscene up here gonna screw everything up?

2635
04:45:01,880 --> 04:45:03,590
um

2636
04:45:03,590 --> 04:45:05,830
Decent odds wait, no, no, no, we killed him

2637
04:45:07,669 --> 04:45:08,790
Yeah

2638
04:45:08,790 --> 04:45:11,099
We also killed him

2639
04:45:11,259 --> 04:45:13,259
He can't close us in the

2640
04:45:17,180 --> 04:45:28,680
He's a mean guy. He'll never become elden lord. I mean if he just ran up there after everything died

2641
04:45:29,400 --> 04:45:36,869
It's like put the crown on or whatever it work. I got explosives

2642
04:45:46,569 --> 04:45:48,569
Yo, I am getting the smithing stones

2643
04:45:49,380 --> 04:45:51,060
This is i'm ramping

2644
04:45:51,060 --> 04:45:59,819
Can you get out of the way?

2645
04:46:01,580 --> 04:46:03,979
I think uh me we might need a

2646
04:46:05,099 --> 04:46:07,099
We might need a full reset soon

2647
04:46:07,580 --> 04:46:10,459
Because every like 30 seconds, you're kind of just teleporting

2648
04:46:22,680 --> 04:46:24,680
oh

2649
04:46:28,810 --> 04:46:51,900
He's strong be strong watch out misbegotten, uh, he's kind of stuck up there

2650
04:46:52,540 --> 04:47:03,430
See what happens watch out watch out

2651
04:47:08,619 --> 04:47:11,180

Crystal spear. I kind of like that

2655
04:47:19,720 --> 04:47:20,759
Yo

2656
04:47:20,759 --> 04:47:22,099

Yeah, maybe

2659
04:47:35,029 --> 04:47:37,849
Cool. I like my character now what changed?

2660
04:47:39,619 --> 04:47:40,659

2661
04:47:40,659 --> 04:47:47,459
Put on regular just slacks and like a cool cape and a wolf head. Oh, okay. That's all it took

2662
04:47:48,020 --> 04:47:50,979
A nice pair of slacks. We got a raid. Oh, a raid did come in

2663
04:47:52,310 --> 04:47:54,310
from snaps cube

2664
04:47:54,389 --> 04:47:57,770
Welcome everybody playing

2665
04:47:57,930 --> 04:47:59,540

co-op seamless co-op mod

2667
04:48:02,740 --> 04:48:06,330
I don't know why I just swallowed weird

2668
04:48:06,330 --> 04:48:15,139
Human body is a wonder. It's been pretty good so far. I'll say it's been

2669
04:48:16,409 --> 04:48:18,409
When we first were talking about doing this, I was actually

2670
04:48:19,049 --> 04:48:24,090
Pretty scared that this was going to be every five minutes. We were going to crash or oh I desync

2671
04:48:24,169 --> 04:48:35,430
Oh reset it. This has been pretty great. I'd say he fell except for that right there, but that was it happens sometimes

2672
04:48:35,509 --> 04:48:39,799
It's okay

2673
04:48:39,799 --> 04:48:42,360
You fell is everyone falling just just

2674
04:48:43,000 --> 04:48:50,630
I'm working through something right now. I got oh I can upgrade my sword a lot

2675
04:48:51,189 --> 04:48:54,060
smithing stone two times three

2676
04:48:55,110 --> 04:48:57,540
You're getting a lot of those. I'm not getting any

2677
04:48:57,619 --> 04:49:08,119
Yeah, i'm i'm I think I could hit like plus 15 right now if I go upgrade. Did you just do you know the button?

2678
04:49:14,409 --> 04:49:15,930
Oh god

2679
04:49:15,930 --> 04:49:17,930
Oh god, what is that?

2680
04:49:18,490 --> 04:49:22,330
I forgot. There's an enemy that like jump scares you there and it's a fucking bear

2681
04:49:22,330 --> 04:49:24,330
There

2682
04:49:24,650 --> 04:49:26,810
I pressed it. I swear to god

2683
04:49:31,240 --> 04:49:32,200
I

2684
04:49:32,200 --> 04:49:35,880
I pressed it. I'm why you would not do that three times

2685
04:49:36,360 --> 04:49:41,689
Yeah, gameplay on my stream. No, no, no, no, no, no, I pressed it

2686
04:49:43,209 --> 04:49:48,459
All right, dude

2687
04:49:51,459 --> 04:49:54,250
Where are you?

2688
04:49:54,250 --> 04:49:56,549
Behind you you gotta do another jump

2689
04:50:01,830 --> 04:50:06,950
Ah, you think you're so funny think about it until the very end

2690
04:50:07,909 --> 04:50:12,389
I could I could just I could get them. I could get them real good here. Holy shit a bear is up here

2691
04:50:12,869 --> 04:50:16,180
What the heck?

2692
04:50:16,180 --> 04:50:18,180
Nice reaction. That was a good react

2693
04:50:20,599 --> 04:50:27,830
One of the one of the best all-time reacts. This actually is a pretty hard spot in the regular game. Yeah in the lore the

2694
04:50:28,950 --> 04:50:40,869
Halberd the kind of winged knight that's up there is actually really annoying. I just got some pants for real

2695
04:50:42,659 --> 04:50:46,299
I'm not even joking. I've got pants

2696
04:50:46,860 --> 04:50:53,900
Well, that's a way easier enemy to deal with

2697
04:51:06,619 --> 04:51:08,790
There's a hole there if you wanted

2698
04:51:09,430 --> 04:51:11,860
If you need like a joke, i'm fine

2699
04:51:27,080 --> 04:51:30,729
Yeah, I we we probably I don't know when you want to do it but

2700
04:51:31,610 --> 04:51:36,330
You you are we are have we our connection together is not fantastic right now

2701
04:51:36,490 --> 04:51:39,849
Uh, let's end here and I can go upgrade my sword. I'll kick you out

2702
04:51:39,930 --> 04:51:45,880
Okay, kick me out and like i'm like reset like the game game. You know what I mean reset the game game

2703
04:51:46,200 --> 04:51:49,659
We set the game game

2704
04:51:49,740 --> 04:51:52,459
You look golden and crispy you why do you look deep fried?

2705
04:51:54,889 --> 04:52:00,139
You've been in a tanning booth

2706
04:52:00,939 --> 04:52:03,770
All right, you kicked me out, right?

2707
04:52:03,770 --> 04:52:05,529
Yeah, i'm gonna like

2708
04:52:05,529 --> 04:52:12,119
Quit and reset i'm gonna like actually restart the whole game like to desktop

2709
04:52:12,840 --> 04:52:14,439
I suggest you do it too

2710
04:52:14,439 --> 04:52:20,139
I feel like we haven't had a refresh in a little while you're calling for a full refresh

2711
04:52:20,540 --> 04:52:41,419
I am calling for a full refresh. Okay, i'm back dude

2712
04:52:41,819 --> 04:52:45,180
Um gamer mode was just fucking activated, dude

2713
04:52:46,630 --> 04:52:48,709
My long sword went from five to plus 14

2714
04:52:50,950 --> 04:52:52,389
Official gamer

2715
04:52:52,389 --> 04:52:54,630
Wait, I can still go further. I just don't have the souls

2716
04:52:57,509 --> 04:53:00,360
uh

2717
04:53:00,360 --> 04:53:01,799
We might have a problem

2718
04:53:01,799 --> 04:53:09,799
What's the problem? I can't open the game anymore. What is what is it saying?

2719
04:53:10,439 --> 04:53:14,470
Because I just activated game remote. I don't know if you heard

2720
04:53:15,110 --> 04:53:20,709
um

2721
04:53:20,709 --> 04:53:23,270
Maybe time for a full reset

2722
04:53:23,430 --> 04:53:24,549
Yeah

2723
04:53:24,549 --> 04:53:33,990
Well, let me do this again and make sure this is not going to be a problem. Okay, we're okay

2724
04:53:36,599 --> 04:53:38,599
Oh, thank god. All right for a second

2725
04:53:39,430 --> 04:53:45,029
I got like a hard crash with like the with the red stop sign and the white x in the middle and it was like

2726
04:53:45,029 --> 04:53:56,709
Blah blah blah blah a bunch of bullshit. I was like this is bad. So we're good. Did you do a uh reset?

2727
04:53:58,619 --> 04:53:59,580
Yeah

2728
04:53:59,580 --> 04:54:08,740
He's you're lying. I you know, you didn't okay doing a full reset. I got my I got my sword to plus 16 germo

2729
04:54:09,619 --> 04:54:11,619
I'm very excited to use it

2730
04:54:11,700 --> 04:54:13,700
Um, i'm gonna do a raid with you

2731
04:54:14,900 --> 04:54:17,299
Yeah, like like a wow raid not like a

2732
04:54:18,099 --> 04:54:21,270
twitch raid

2733
04:54:21,270 --> 04:54:25,479
People make fun of me for doing wow references. I hope they do it to you too

2734
04:54:26,040 --> 04:54:30,840
I have I I don't know anything about wow. I was doing that for you. Oh, okay. Thanks

2735
04:54:33,610 --> 04:54:37,930
Uh, I am gonna go back to oh, yeah. Remember you need to launch with the the dot back

2736
04:54:37,930 --> 04:54:52,869
Yeah, that's why you were getting errors. Uh, I think I did it right. So we're going to the rampart tower, right? I am ready

2737
04:54:53,509 --> 04:54:57,349
Hopefully a full reset will fix the teleporting problem because you were kind of just

2738
04:54:58,060 --> 04:55:03,419
I want to say every 30 seconds or so every every enemy and you would freeze and then 10 five seconds later

2739
04:55:03,419 --> 04:55:16,919
It'd be like everything would just kind of catch up. Hope this fixes it. So how are you how you feel?

2740
04:55:17,479 --> 04:55:19,319
Are you good? How do I feel? I feel great

2741
04:55:19,319 --> 04:55:24,279
I feel like i'm like i'm at the top of my class like i'm getting straight a's but I just put down my uh

2742
04:55:24,599 --> 04:55:28,439
My thing you can join i'm talking about like playing this and streaming this you you're good to go

2743
04:55:28,520 --> 04:55:32,919
Keep going right i'm i'm I just got the plus 16. All right, I want to hit some things with my new sword

2744
04:55:33,000 --> 04:55:39,159
I'm i'm i'm down to stay here for a little while too. This was just checking in

2745
04:55:39,400 --> 04:55:57,020
I just want to hit something with my sword. We're good. Let's go. Oh my god

2746
04:55:57,340 --> 04:56:02,090
I think I know about that too. I'm the one that came up with that

2747
04:56:03,349 --> 04:56:17,159
You actually are the originator. You don't think I know that skip. This is a good guy over here

2748
04:56:18,169 --> 04:56:21,750
Hey, hey you isn't this a really scary big like bird enemy?

2749
04:56:22,470 --> 04:56:24,340
Yeah

2750
04:56:24,340 --> 04:56:46,069
The awful like we made this game, but we also didn't want you to enjoy it bird enemy dude. Look at this damage

2751
04:56:48,439 --> 04:56:50,599
What's so is that just a regular? Oh my god

2752
04:56:51,400 --> 04:56:53,400
That actually was a lot

2753
04:56:53,400 --> 04:56:55,319
How much was that?

2754
04:56:55,319 --> 04:56:57,319
Uh, it was 570

2755
04:56:58,330 --> 04:57:00,099
What?

2756
04:57:00,099 --> 04:57:04,840
Oh, I definitely have to put that on

2757
04:57:04,919 --> 04:57:07,259
All right. That's perfect

2758
04:57:07,259 --> 04:57:13,939
Don't worry stand behind me. I've never even seen this. Does this have any attributes on it?

2759
04:57:18,630 --> 04:57:22,330
No, it's goofy

2760
04:57:23,209 --> 04:57:53,930
Insane drip you're looking fresh. I look like i'm belong in a katamari game. Nice line. Nice line

2761
04:57:54,009 --> 04:57:55,610
There's been a lot of bugs

2762
04:57:55,610 --> 04:57:57,610
But you have like an antecedent

2763
04:57:58,020 --> 04:58:04,419
One shot. All right. Now we definitely are going to be able to beat this whole game, right? Like if that's the case

2764
04:58:04,500 --> 04:58:17,689
I ascend it. This is glint stone pebble people you just killed that I hate him

2765
04:58:26,259 --> 04:58:33,270
Watch out dragons ahead

2766
04:58:33,270 --> 04:58:35,270
flag

2767
04:58:35,590 --> 04:58:38,310
In my first playthrough, I was looking at my menu and that

2768
04:58:39,130 --> 04:58:42,090
Swept down like that and I thought it was a dragon tail and I screamed

2769
04:58:42,569 --> 04:58:45,610
That's pretty crazy. I've never noticed it

2770
04:58:53,740 --> 04:58:59,340
Oh shit, we got a bow boy. Keep it down. That actually is one of the harder ones, isn't it?

2771
04:58:59,819 --> 04:59:09,459
Honestly, you should just

2772
04:59:09,540 --> 04:59:12,619
You're doing 600 plus damage. Yeah

2773
04:59:17,909 --> 04:59:20,709
Oh my goodness. I'm so glad I didn't get hit by that

2774
04:59:21,590 --> 04:59:33,689
I thought I had another weapon in my other hand

2775
04:59:35,220 --> 04:59:37,220
Whirl. Oh flame

2776
04:59:41,909 --> 04:59:44,090
Oh, he's too short. He's too short

2777
04:59:44,090 --> 04:59:50,569
You gotta fight him

2778
04:59:50,569 --> 04:59:52,650
All my swings just went over his head. I got him

2779
04:59:59,669 --> 05:00:04,729
Cool. This is a fun game

2780
05:00:04,729 --> 05:00:09,130
Should I play this game normally? I haven't this is the first time i've really played it. Is this like a yeah

2781
05:00:11,819 --> 05:00:18,549
Um, I actually wouldn't really recommend it alone. It's like too hard and like I don't it's not even like fun

2782
05:00:18,869 --> 05:00:24,630
Are there this exhausting are there this many enemies that are spawned in and stuff or is it like are they how does it work normally?

2783
05:00:25,860 --> 05:00:27,860
Uh, this is about the same like really

2784
05:00:28,500 --> 05:00:30,500
It's just the co-op thing. Yeah

2785
05:00:30,740 --> 05:00:34,740
Like a lot of a lot of this you're thinking that but a lot of the spawns in this game don't really make any sense

2786
05:00:36,939 --> 05:00:42,439
Like they put crabs next to like sorcerers and stuff. It's kind of just spam enemies. You should rest

2787
05:00:43,000 --> 05:00:48,619
I'm uh, i'm trying to make you remember when we played terraria together

2788
05:00:49,099 --> 05:00:51,900
I'm I know I remember I brought it up earlier and um

2789
05:00:54,119 --> 05:00:59,240
Again, everyone i'd like to apologize for like making germa play a great game and having a fun time with him

2790
05:00:59,560 --> 05:01:01,799
I'd like to sincerely just say i'm sorry

2791
05:01:02,439 --> 05:01:06,040
There was a lot of minus twos that just didn't even understand what was going on right there

2792
05:01:06,279 --> 05:01:14,060
For those of you that don't know stir and I played terraria together and it was me just watching him play with like a thousand mods

2793
05:01:14,459 --> 05:01:18,939
And i've never played terraria before and I was just like is this game like fun normally and he's like, yeah

2794
05:01:19,020 --> 05:01:32,330
Yeah, but like don't worry. Just come over here. Yeah, take take all these items. Nothing wrong. Just watching

2795
05:01:32,409 --> 05:01:34,889
All you guys are just watching. Hey, I had a good time. It was fun

2796
05:01:42,500 --> 05:01:48,919
I remember

2797
05:01:48,919 --> 05:01:53,720
It really was so funny because I remember it's half the time. I would just be like hey i'd be up in the base

2798
05:01:54,599 --> 05:01:56,599
And you'd be down

2799
05:01:56,659 --> 05:02:01,000
Adventuring somewhere just collecting ore like the one specific ore that you needed

2800
05:02:02,229 --> 05:02:03,369
and

2801
05:02:03,369 --> 05:02:05,369
whoa

2802
05:02:05,369 --> 05:02:11,290
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think that just both get a great drop. Yeah, I think that's

2803
05:02:12,090 --> 05:02:17,740
I got a fantastic drop doing that. Oh, it's one of those omens. Hold on

2804
05:02:21,029 --> 05:02:25,770
From where though? Is it an omen? No

2805
05:02:28,200 --> 05:02:32,200
All the way up there ignore him. Yeah, yeah that guy we killed earlier, but he respawned

2806
05:02:32,680 --> 05:02:34,680
Let's just get this bonfire

2807
05:02:34,680 --> 05:02:39,740
And then go up the other way

2808
05:02:39,819 --> 05:02:41,819
I think this thing is really really good

2809
05:02:47,770 --> 05:02:49,689
Oh my goodness

2810
05:02:49,689 --> 05:03:07,930
50 strength, I could almost do that. What about the int? I can respec when we do the um

2811
05:03:09,560 --> 05:03:25,860
Academy. Yeah, we already have the key. Yeah good for now. No me strong doesn't have intelligence

2812
05:03:31,159 --> 05:03:33,159
Ooh, I like that

2813
05:03:33,799 --> 05:03:35,240
I like your outfit

2814
05:03:35,240 --> 05:03:42,979
There we go. I was waiting. Okay. Yeah, that's my good drop. You're just missing the default green tunic

2815
05:03:47,080 --> 05:03:57,669
Well, i'm kind of like an epic bar face the glint stone pebbler

2816
05:04:02,069 --> 05:04:04,069
We're we're at godric. Aren't we?

2817
05:04:04,779 --> 05:04:24,439
Yeah, he's like right through here

2818
05:04:24,439 --> 05:04:26,439
magic missile magic missile

2819
05:04:32,700 --> 05:04:39,139
Secure that for you secure that kill but my game keeps lagging

2820
05:04:44,040 --> 05:04:46,040
Are you on are you on the wi-fi?

2821
05:04:48,490 --> 05:04:55,689
Yeah, but it's a good wi-fi router. I have like five to ten megabytes down. No. Oh the oh the giga mat

2822
05:04:59,110 --> 05:05:00,790
the bamco giga mat

2823
05:05:00,790 --> 05:05:04,869
I just don't think that I think this mod does not like um the bigger open areas

2824
05:05:07,590 --> 05:05:12,229
It does uh, like when we load a new zone. Sometimes it freezes and wiggles

2825
05:05:12,709 --> 05:05:18,979
It hasn't been that bad for me

2826
05:05:19,939 --> 05:05:24,740
Cool, but I don't need it

2827
05:05:26,090 --> 05:05:28,950
Oh, what'd you get?

2828
05:05:28,950 --> 05:05:31,020
mushroom arms

2829
05:05:31,020 --> 05:05:32,659
Oh

2830
05:05:32,659 --> 05:05:34,180
Can't really see him

2831
05:05:34,180 --> 05:05:36,180
No, i'm not on the wi-fi

2832
05:05:36,419 --> 05:05:52,979
It's an item over here. What is it? I am going to one shot godric

2833
05:05:55,779 --> 05:05:57,779
I hope you do this

2834
05:05:59,509 --> 05:06:01,509
Well godric is going to be a dog

2835
05:06:03,259 --> 05:06:06,380
Uh, we're aggroing like every single thing here

2836
05:06:07,020 --> 05:06:09,770
It's probably not a good idea

2837
05:06:13,819 --> 05:06:15,270
oh

2838
05:06:15,270 --> 05:06:30,569
I've run out of magics

2839
05:06:31,740 --> 05:06:33,740
Oh these fuckers. He almost got me

2840
05:06:54,259 --> 05:06:58,250
Got a larval tear I have one too. So that's awesome

2841
05:06:58,970 --> 05:07:02,569
Oh, okay. I thought you were looking for one. Yeah, I got one. I actually got one really early

2842
05:07:03,130 --> 05:07:04,889
It was like

2843
05:07:04,889 --> 05:07:08,090
I want to say the first like half hour we were playing first hour

2844
05:07:08,889 --> 05:07:21,139
Okay

2845
05:07:21,139 --> 05:07:23,939
Candle stand i'm getting a lot of random weapons now

2846
05:07:24,659 --> 05:07:28,169
Yeah, I think we're pretty set to just do content

2847
05:07:38,869 --> 05:07:46,360
Oh painting

2848
05:07:46,360 --> 05:07:51,979
Morgan's cursed sword rate mace. Is that should I use that?

2849
05:07:52,779 --> 05:08:05,220
Oh, yeah, some blood weapon. Fuck that. How did I just break that myself?

2850
05:08:05,860 --> 05:08:09,099
I don't know you can power stance then

2851
05:08:11,220 --> 05:08:21,369
This thing gave me three awesome items. I prefer the mace

2852
05:08:31,400 --> 05:08:32,819
another one

2853
05:08:32,819 --> 05:08:34,439
gargoyles greataxe

2854
05:08:34,439 --> 05:08:37,430
Another one that might be better than what I have right now

2855
05:08:38,549 --> 05:08:50,950
Have you have you plus one a single weapon? Yeah, i'm holding right now. You should do a weld

2856
05:08:51,430 --> 05:09:09,029
You want me to do a weld do a weld huge weapons. I think dual welding is

2857
05:09:09,770 --> 05:09:18,599
Definitely dangerous, especially if you don't have a mask for it if you want you do jump attacks. They're really strong

2858
05:09:23,639 --> 05:09:25,639
Oh my god, that seems amazing

2859
05:09:27,770 --> 05:09:33,080
I'm actually gonna do this for a minute. Oh

2860
05:09:34,169 --> 05:09:36,299
Little gross boy

2861
05:09:36,299 --> 05:09:43,619
Didn't even see that until it started moving. Oh, we got one of like I hate these enemies

2862
05:09:44,099 --> 05:09:47,139
Oh, there's been a lot of I hate these enemies thrown out there today

2863
05:09:48,599 --> 05:09:50,700
This is a real

2864
05:09:50,700 --> 05:09:53,979
One takes the cake. Uh, this is bad. This is actually not good

2865
05:09:54,950 --> 05:10:00,709
This is gonna be harder than the boss it probably right now and i'm getting killed by a fucking one singular gargoyle

2866
05:10:03,400 --> 05:10:05,159
Good luck

2867
05:10:05,159 --> 05:10:07,159
I love this slap

2868
05:10:07,720 --> 05:10:24,060
Oh my fucker fucking fucks. What the fuck? What was that? I think it was one of the enemies

2869
05:10:27,720 --> 05:10:29,500
Are you okay?

2870
05:10:29,500 --> 05:10:38,520
Yeah, i'm good. Yeah, watch out. There's like this one gargoyle up there. You're not gonna want to fight that guy

2871
05:10:39,159 --> 05:10:41,299
Okay

2872
05:10:41,299 --> 05:10:43,860
It might have even been this one. He's killing me again

2873
05:10:44,740 --> 05:10:53,349
Oh shit with the dog

2874
05:10:53,349 --> 05:10:57,029
Here a whimper i'm doing all strength and endurance and i'm gonna do dual weld

2875
05:11:09,639 --> 05:11:14,279
This he's sitting up on this stupid fence post thing and I can't hit him fight the other stuff

2876
05:11:20,729 --> 05:11:24,330
Dude, this is a shit show of an uh, and this is this is

2877
05:11:25,659 --> 05:11:27,659
I don't think we can walk by here

2878
05:11:27,979 --> 05:11:32,939
I don't need to you don't run up there. Don't start hitting the things sitting on the spike

2879
05:11:34,459 --> 05:11:36,729
We got a dual weld

2880
05:11:36,729 --> 05:11:42,700
Okay, hold on minus five thousand souls, by the way, what do you mean me or who me?

2881
05:11:44,200 --> 05:11:48,659
I'm still alive still. Okay, kill this girl girl

2882
05:11:54,340 --> 05:11:55,619
one at a time

2883
05:11:55,619 --> 05:12:00,790
Okay, I can magic bolt the the ass sitter

2884
05:12:01,909 --> 05:12:10,970
And I don't know what is shooting that like giant blob of poison. I have no idea

2885
05:12:13,189 --> 05:12:15,189
This other thing the guy with the crown

2886
05:12:17,049 --> 05:12:19,049
I don't think we can fight this

2887
05:12:19,979 --> 05:12:21,819
We can it's just

2888
05:12:21,819 --> 05:12:27,459
We gotta like one v one and not be like perma staggered when he comes out here or two v one

2889
05:12:27,939 --> 05:12:30,740
Because i'm always fighting some other shit while you're fighting it

2890
05:12:31,299 --> 05:12:48,009
Oh, it's him doing that

2891
05:12:48,169 --> 05:12:52,169
Oh my god, look at the surface area. The surface area is insane

2892
05:13:04,759 --> 05:13:13,669
And it made me realize there's a good item back here. Well, uh, I don't want to reset this but i'm poisoned

2893
05:13:13,669 --> 05:13:16,229
Hopefully how long do not we're good

2894
05:13:27,560 --> 05:13:29,159
there

2895
05:13:29,159 --> 05:13:30,119
You are

2896
05:13:30,200 --> 05:13:55,799
Okay, bye

2897
05:13:55,799 --> 05:13:58,439
You good. Oh, you got the finger. I got the finger

2898
05:14:04,299 --> 05:14:08,389
Well, I think I know what?

2899
05:14:08,709 --> 05:14:17,990
Has to happen now, right?

2900
05:14:17,990 --> 05:14:20,790
I I don't know what needs to happen. This is the weapon i'm using

2901
05:14:22,419 --> 05:14:25,860
All right. I mean i'm pretty settled in what I got. I'm i'm comfortable

2902
05:14:31,110 --> 05:14:34,200
Can I do a well, um, it didn't look like I could swing both

2903
05:14:40,020 --> 05:14:45,380
Is it like a joke that how you pronounce that is that like a running gag or is it real? What do you mean?

2904
05:14:46,119 --> 05:14:50,279
Dual weld dual welding dual will do wielding

2905
05:14:50,840 --> 05:15:00,520
do welding

2906
05:15:00,520 --> 05:15:01,479
Bam

2907
05:15:01,479 --> 05:15:02,840
Did I kill it?

2908
05:15:02,840 --> 05:15:05,080
Yeah

2909
05:15:05,080 --> 05:15:07,240
Dual wheel dual wielding

2910
05:15:10,200 --> 05:15:15,000
You almost sound like when you say it that way that you're trying to do like the ubu duo wielding

2911
05:15:19,020 --> 05:15:21,270
This is what it sucks

2912
05:15:21,270 --> 05:15:24,310
The finger this thing's dumb. It didn't even hurt anything

2913
05:15:25,110 --> 05:15:27,740
Actually, it's kind of good. Never mind

2914
05:15:27,819 --> 05:15:30,299
Okay, changed your tune pretty quick there buddy. Do

2915
05:15:31,740 --> 05:15:33,020
Welding

2916
05:15:33,020 --> 05:15:34,700
Duo wounding

2917
05:15:34,700 --> 05:15:36,150
All right. Are we ready?

2918
05:15:36,150 --> 05:15:41,509
Uh, no, let's go up the stairs the other direction and and get those items and just look what's up there

2919
05:15:41,830 --> 05:15:48,520
Do a wee bit of a rest

2920
05:15:48,520 --> 05:15:53,419
Uh, let me put a point into what do you think strength? Of course wait endurance

2921
05:15:53,740 --> 05:16:07,580
I love how this greatly increases your maximum fp and it is

2922
05:16:08,840 --> 05:16:11,130
as much

2923
05:16:11,130 --> 05:16:13,130
I don't think they can even cast one spill

2924
05:16:13,369 --> 05:16:20,470
It's because it's percent based

2925
05:16:20,470 --> 05:16:36,409
Yeah

2926
05:16:36,889 --> 05:16:40,389
It's really not I need to like upgrade it

2927
05:16:42,650 --> 05:16:45,130
Upgrading things is pretty good

2928
05:16:56,580 --> 05:17:00,419
You know, what's really actually good about this is you don't get staggered if you take damage while you do it

2929
05:17:06,229 --> 05:17:18,060
Oh, is it one of those those are really good. It seems pretty good. Okay, where did you go?

2930
05:17:18,540 --> 05:17:24,380
Bro, are you on the wi-fi? I went back down to the bonfire. Oh and I rest it

2931
05:17:25,099 --> 05:17:33,639
oh

2932
05:17:33,639 --> 05:17:41,369
All right

2933
05:17:41,369 --> 05:17:48,409
I don't look funny enough. Can you can you step up your comedy right now?

2934
05:17:48,569 --> 05:17:54,700
I haven't laughed in like an hour. I know like what the fuck dude. I think this is pretty good actually

2935
05:17:57,240 --> 05:18:00,169
I you feel like I like your face

2936
05:18:01,880 --> 05:18:04,279
I miss my face. I only wore this for you

2937
05:18:04,919 --> 05:18:09,349
Do you want it? I'm not going you think i'm gonna try to

2938
05:18:09,990 --> 05:18:14,630
Pretend to be one of the most celebrated people on planet earth. No, there's only one bar

2939
05:18:14,630 --> 05:18:16,630
I'm actually kind of offended that you did that

2940
05:18:16,869 --> 05:18:18,069
Did what?

2941
05:18:18,069 --> 05:18:22,549
You know, nobody can be barf drinker besides barf drinker. Okay. Well, i'm no longer barf drinker

2942
05:18:22,549 --> 05:18:26,549
I apologize. I thought you'd think it was like funny and we'd have like a ha you're barf. Sorry

2943
05:18:27,290 --> 05:18:29,459
I don't I didn't see what it was

2944
05:18:29,459 --> 05:18:33,540
Uh, are we skipping or we uh, we uh story watchers. We are

2945
05:18:36,700 --> 05:18:39,259
Skipping skipping

2946
05:18:39,259 --> 05:18:47,189
Can't skip it. Oh, it's god free the grafted. Oh shit

2947
05:18:48,459 --> 05:18:51,819
This might not be that bad though. This was one of the dumber ones

2948
05:18:57,779 --> 05:19:00,020
Oh my god, dude, just stand there and cast

2949
05:19:00,659 --> 05:19:02,020
glint stone

2950
05:19:02,020 --> 05:19:03,540
glint stone

2951
05:19:03,540 --> 05:19:05,380
glint stone

2952
05:19:05,380 --> 05:19:07,459
glintstone pebble

2953
05:19:07,459 --> 05:19:10,810
i'm out

2954
05:19:10,810 --> 05:19:13,619
Shit

2955
05:19:13,619 --> 05:19:23,799
I'm gonna die

2956
05:19:27,540 --> 05:19:29,540
All right, I gotta stop using the comedy move

2957
05:19:33,830 --> 05:19:35,619
See stop

2958
05:19:35,619 --> 05:19:38,099
What he's actually teleporting that's what i'm saying

2959
05:19:44,299 --> 05:19:46,700
Finger him. Wait, wait, wait. Let me get the last hit

2960
05:19:47,259 --> 05:19:54,860
Finger him. What the fuck dude? What what what?

2961
05:19:55,419 --> 05:19:59,209
What I got four golden seeds

2962
05:20:01,419 --> 05:20:03,259
What are you kidding me?

2963
05:20:03,259 --> 05:20:06,860
What did you get? I got a heater shield and

2964
05:20:07,959 --> 05:20:11,319
I didn't I didn't even care. It was so I didn't even I didn't even

2965
05:20:11,880 --> 05:20:16,279
You got well, at least you got cool stuff

2966
05:20:16,279 --> 05:20:20,919
Yeah, I don't know if I would be betting against us right now. He has an absolutely jacked up

2967
05:20:21,560 --> 05:20:27,299
Glint stone. Why are you doing that much damage? I don't understand. How are you doing that? Um

2968
05:20:28,099 --> 05:20:30,099
Because it is a weapon art

2969
05:20:30,180 --> 05:20:36,900
It's not the actual spell and then the weapon art spells are tied to the upgrade level of your weapon and my weapons plus 16

2970
05:20:37,540 --> 05:20:39,540
magic glint stone pebble sword

2971
05:20:40,169 --> 05:21:00,009
Jesus like if it was an actual glint stone pebble spell it wouldn't be doing that much. Okay

2972
05:21:00,409 --> 05:21:02,650
Let's uh, let's go find some bosses. Hold on

2973
05:21:03,450 --> 05:21:06,970
I can level up one more time

2974
05:21:07,529 --> 05:21:14,259
I got 20 vigor. I I can do um, just dumping the strength now. I think that's the plan

2975
05:21:18,779 --> 05:21:25,099
Plus 10 finger would be sick. Maybe i'll do it. Uh, do you need any smithing stones?

2976
05:21:25,180 --> 05:21:28,299
I I have quite a lot of sombers you'll probably get you up to like a

2977
05:21:28,860 --> 05:21:32,299
Does this use? Uh, yeah, what does this use? Is it somber or is it regular?

2978
05:21:37,000 --> 05:21:42,549
I don't know. This thing's kind of a piece of shit though

2979
05:21:44,020 --> 05:21:48,340
Strength d dex d and 20. I mean 50. I mean this thing kind of sucks

2980
05:21:48,659 --> 05:22:00,470
I know i'm so indecisive. I have to pick something usually again

2981
05:22:00,630 --> 05:22:07,669
I think we actually switch personalities because usually this would be me I picked up a default long sword and was like that's that's the one

2982
05:22:07,990 --> 05:22:17,590
What about this thing though?

2983
05:22:17,590 --> 05:22:22,709
I expected that if we played together you'd be using a whip. So this is uh an upgrade really

2984
05:22:23,509 --> 05:22:27,610
Yeah, okay

2985
05:22:27,610 --> 05:22:32,250
I will keep the finger for a comedy weapon, but i'm going to probably upgrade the ruins great sword

2986
05:22:32,409 --> 05:22:43,479
I think that's the plan. Okay in the meantime, let me put the actual thing that I had. Yeah, it's just for now

2987
05:22:43,880 --> 05:23:03,459
Nobody here sitting sitting that no one's here sitting the chair. Oh my god. Don't don't get out of that chair

2988
05:23:03,860 --> 05:23:11,240
You haven't earned it. I did sit in it. You lagged because you're on a fucking 28k modem. I'm on a 45 180

2989
05:23:11,779 --> 05:23:39,979
Forget where you go here. Okay, you still haven't landed

2990
05:23:40,700 --> 05:23:43,500
He's okay. That was funny. I got my rivers of blood

2991
05:23:44,380 --> 05:23:50,500
But i'm more of a default long sword kind of guy

2992
05:23:53,990 --> 05:23:57,349
It's weird. I mean, I I know I know you pretty well at this point

2993
05:23:57,750 --> 05:24:03,700
But it is kind of interesting that we're playing randomizer and you're like, yeah, i'll take just the regular long sword

2994
05:24:05,080 --> 05:24:08,790
I haven't really found anything else that like made sense

2995
05:24:08,869 --> 05:24:18,549
I did want to be a spellcaster. We haven't found anything. I got a crystal spear, but they kind of suck man

2996
05:24:18,549 --> 05:24:22,169
There is I I didn't want to over complicate it even more

2997
05:24:22,169 --> 05:24:26,729
But I think there's an option in the randomizer that when you find an item it also has like a random ash of war

2998
05:24:27,130 --> 05:24:28,889
and they can be um

2999
05:24:28,889 --> 05:24:34,569
Get like some really weird combination items. This is the guy that

3000
05:24:35,849 --> 05:24:42,139
I I know I have to tell you like you this is that guy, right? I yes it is you say so

3001
05:24:47,610 --> 05:24:50,810
Give me some runes, please donate 10 runes. Sure

3002
05:24:50,810 --> 05:24:53,110
Yes

3003
05:24:53,990 --> 05:25:06,470
Oh ancient death rancor kill him take a path to the graveyard

3004
05:25:08,810 --> 05:25:10,970
I just realized that this is not the outfit he's supposed to have on

3005
05:25:26,779 --> 05:25:37,959
Bubble people I think we can just go straight to uh ray lucaria because we have the keys

3006
05:25:38,680 --> 05:25:41,750
Yeah, we do

3007
05:25:41,750 --> 05:25:47,080
Pretty far away though. No, you like go down this hill and then you're out into the lake

3008
05:26:01,290 --> 05:26:04,680
Hmm. What's on your food?

3009
05:26:04,919 --> 05:26:06,919
Uh radar what what should I get?

3010
05:26:07,479 --> 05:26:13,459
What should I do what's on my food radar for your radar? Yeah, like what what are you thinking?

3011
05:26:14,900 --> 05:26:16,900
What am I thinking that you should eat?

3012
05:26:17,939 --> 05:26:19,939
Not necessarily. Yeah

3013
05:26:19,939 --> 05:26:21,909
now

3014
05:26:21,909 --> 05:26:23,909
Well, if you don't want to hear it

3015
05:26:24,939 --> 05:26:27,819
You I don't know lasagna. I that's that's not

3016
05:26:28,700 --> 05:26:32,139
Oh, hey mcdonald's or like a pizza or like making

3017
05:26:32,939 --> 05:26:34,939
I'm not gonna make a fucking lasagna

3018
05:26:35,740 --> 05:26:37,930
Not right now

3019
05:26:38,569 --> 05:26:40,709
Actually

3020
05:26:40,709 --> 05:26:43,819
That sounds pretty good

3021
05:26:43,819 --> 05:26:46,250
That's a that takes a lot of time

3022
05:26:46,250 --> 05:26:48,250
It does it takes a very long time

3023
05:26:49,459 --> 05:26:52,259
Uh, you're gonna let's just you're gonna keep riding kill this thing

3024
05:26:52,900 --> 05:26:57,819
I'm not killing it

3025
05:26:57,819 --> 05:27:03,020
So were you gonna upgrade that because again like I I might actually have all the way to plus 10 somber smithing stones

3026
05:27:03,259 --> 05:27:05,259
Maybe I haven't decided yet

3027
05:27:06,279 --> 05:27:08,279
But I somebody said you can't drop

3028
05:27:08,680 --> 05:27:11,020
stones

3029
05:27:11,020 --> 05:27:13,020
Really? I don't know if they're lying enough

3030
05:27:23,479 --> 05:27:27,400
You can't apparently you cannot drop, uh smithing stones on the ground

3031
05:27:27,880 --> 05:27:31,529
Although this is not in the right spot now it is

3032
05:27:36,740 --> 05:27:38,740
I'll just keep them for when I find something

3033
05:27:38,819 --> 05:27:42,900
This is my favorite part of the randomizer so far is opening up these merchant loot boxes

3034
05:27:49,740 --> 05:27:51,900
It's got a lantern for me. Thank god. Yeah

3035
05:27:52,540 --> 05:27:54,139
But I can't afford it

3036
05:27:54,139 --> 05:27:58,490
I think stone one i'll take it

3037
05:27:58,490 --> 05:28:06,200
Uh glenstone craftsman's cookbook. Do you want this? Well, the cookbooks I think are also random

3038
05:28:06,759 --> 05:28:17,529
Why is this so expensive?

3039
05:28:17,529 --> 05:28:24,810
Actually, that's something we probably should have been checking. I forget how the cooking even works. Wait a minute

3040
05:28:24,889 --> 05:28:32,330
This is I can buy this is an unlimited amount of these boiled crab. I can buy

3041
05:28:33,130 --> 05:28:51,000
It's about 20 of them. Um, okay. I'm gonna mark this because

3042
05:28:51,639 --> 05:28:58,200
you know the boiled crab boiled crab boiled crab

3043
05:28:59,080 --> 05:29:00,659
is

3044
05:29:00,659 --> 05:29:03,299
Uh greatly boost physical damage negation for a time

3045
05:29:03,939 --> 05:29:06,819
These are apparently really really hard to come by

3046
05:29:07,380 --> 05:29:11,750
And they're 250 and i'm i'm gonna buy like 500 of them. Sounds like cheating

3047
05:29:13,779 --> 05:29:16,650
It is

3048
05:29:16,650 --> 05:29:26,409
I guess I'd take the bell, right? Okay. All right. Um, where to um straight to lucaria

3049
05:29:27,349 --> 05:29:30,299
The pokemon I think that's his name

3050
05:29:34,119 --> 05:29:42,360
Isn't there a uh a map um, um, he's hitting me he's hitting me even stop hitting me. I can't help you

3051
05:29:43,240 --> 05:29:44,439
I'm fine

3052
05:29:44,439 --> 05:29:47,580
I still don't have a plus one to my flask

3053
05:29:53,720 --> 05:29:57,290
What happened? That was really weird. Okay. I'm all right

3054
05:30:13,700 --> 05:30:16,950
The bonfire

3055
05:30:18,889 --> 05:30:22,490
Yeah, this one's fake. This one's actually fake. This one doesn't work. This one's not real

3056
05:30:22,650 --> 05:30:26,889
They should have added mimic graces that yeah, they like attack you and shit

3057
05:30:29,939 --> 05:30:35,700
Isn't um this this portal if you go in here teleports you all the way up to the door. There's a different one

3058
05:30:37,779 --> 05:30:39,779
I don't remember. Oh legendary

3059
05:30:40,500 --> 05:30:43,349
lord armor

3060
05:30:43,349 --> 05:30:45,349
Yeah travel go in there

3061
05:30:45,590 --> 05:30:46,389
Yeah

3062
05:30:46,389 --> 05:31:06,340
Oh god, where are we going? He doesn't even talk to me anymore

3063
05:31:08,259 --> 05:31:13,459
What did you go on the portal? Yep. Okay

3064
05:31:27,669 --> 05:31:29,669
Man i'm getting the good good stuff

3065
05:31:33,130 --> 05:31:36,520
I'm gonna be elden lord

3066
05:31:36,599 --> 05:31:40,439
You probably are and it's annoying because look at how cool you look and how much powerful you are than me

3067
05:31:40,759 --> 05:31:45,639
We kind of match now. How do I not have a key didn't we both? Oh wait, maybe we I can't use it

3068
05:31:45,639 --> 05:31:47,639
Maybe we bought the fake one

3069
05:31:47,639 --> 05:31:51,099
Because there's there's two keys do I need one too

3070
05:31:52,139 --> 05:31:56,860
No, but there's two lucaria keys one that you give to the guy for a quest and one that you use for yourself

3071
05:31:57,020 --> 05:31:59,180
It's the fucking not. Yeah

3072
05:32:00,220 --> 05:32:01,979
It's the one that he gets

3073
05:32:01,979 --> 05:32:05,340
Okay, and maybe uh, maybe we can go where the dragon is and see if that

3074
05:32:05,900 --> 05:32:08,540
Oh that actually might be a much easier boss

3075
05:32:09,909 --> 05:32:14,540
Yeah, we're jumping off. Uh, be careful. I've died here. I died here probably 30 times

3076
05:32:15,509 --> 05:32:19,349
Okay, well i'll watch you go first. Yeah, you're gonna die dude. Holy shit. That's where you do it

3077
05:32:22,970 --> 05:32:29,220
See trust me. Maybe art. I died so many times jumping off of that edge

3078
05:32:30,200 --> 05:32:36,439
Just being ridiculed and laughed at by everybody watching for days. I just had a flashback

3079
05:32:37,529 --> 05:32:45,000
I remember watching your initial elden ring playthrough in the area near here at the castle church where you have to find the three turtles

3080
05:32:46,779 --> 05:32:52,340
It was the closest i've ever come to just ending it all. Where's the dragon?

3081
05:32:54,569 --> 05:33:04,169
But also I agree. I fucking hate that place. Isn't the dragon right here? Uh

3082
05:33:05,560 --> 05:33:10,900
I don't know. I thought the dragon distracted everything looks the same. I think it's up a bit further

3083
05:33:11,909 --> 05:33:20,799
Is it further up? Oh spinning stone?

3084
05:33:22,139 --> 05:33:27,419
Uh, there's there's a something boss enemy out here. Where are you? Oh shit. We lost each other

3085
05:33:28,139 --> 05:33:30,150
We're good

3086
05:33:30,150 --> 05:33:32,549
Yeah, I would avoid the the super slug boss

3087
05:33:34,220 --> 05:33:36,220
What is that? Is that a oh, it's a tree spirit

3088
05:33:38,520 --> 05:33:42,520
Is that just a regular enemy or is that supposed to be the dragon because the the key is behind the dragon?

3089
05:33:42,919 --> 05:33:44,439
That's a regular enemy

3090
05:33:44,439 --> 05:33:46,439
The dragon's in like the alcove

3091
05:33:51,799 --> 05:33:54,069
dude, he is

3092
05:33:54,069 --> 05:33:56,150
Moving his hips in all sorts of ways

3093
05:33:56,790 --> 05:33:58,790
He is just

3094
05:34:01,639 --> 05:34:05,479
He's so he won't leave he won't stop his aggro range is insane

3095
05:34:06,200 --> 05:34:09,770
Do you want to kill him? Let's do it. Let's teach him a lesson

3096
05:34:26,439 --> 05:34:28,439
Okay

3097
05:34:28,439 --> 05:34:32,790
Um, let's find the dragon. We actually demolished him

3098
05:34:33,430 --> 05:34:38,090
Yeah, let me look at the map. Oh, I didn't get wait. I thought I picked up the map

3099
05:34:39,130 --> 05:34:47,259
Come on snail shoot that ballista. That's okay. I love that. I'm gonna shoot his blister and I'm gonna get them

3100
05:34:48,650 --> 05:34:50,970
Oh, no, wait, I don't have any hands. How am I supposed to do this?

3101
05:34:52,069 --> 05:34:54,950
Don't kill him. He's a character. I made he's he's like a I gave him a voice

3102
05:34:54,950 --> 05:35:00,869
That means he's he gets to live you were the one hitting him. I didn't mean to yeah, let's go

3103
05:35:06,009 --> 05:35:08,009
Uh, I think we're on the wrong side

3104
05:35:10,979 --> 05:35:14,759
um

3105
05:35:14,759 --> 05:35:17,959
We're gonna go like up here like this way, right? Yeah, it's up here

3106
05:35:21,799 --> 05:35:26,180
Pfft

3107
05:35:26,180 --> 05:35:29,060
We're gonna soft lock our game if you give one of the bosses a voice

3108
05:35:30,740 --> 05:35:31,700
Uh-oh

3109
05:35:31,700 --> 05:35:33,939
So don't do that. Isn't it right up here?

3110
05:35:41,340 --> 05:35:43,020
Where where is it?

3111
05:35:43,020 --> 05:35:45,700
We need the map in this direction

3112
05:35:52,060 --> 05:35:54,060
Get out of the way. Yeah, it's up here

3113
05:35:54,619 --> 05:36:03,369
All right. What is it? I hope it's

3114
05:36:04,200 --> 05:36:06,040
I hope it's really easy

3115
05:36:06,040 --> 05:36:08,040
Oh, wait, I think I saw

3116
05:36:08,580 --> 05:36:11,700
Oh, it was a dragon. It's a dragon. What?

3117
05:36:12,500 --> 05:36:20,790
But then it wasn't a dragon but now it is a dragon wait, why is it it's a dragon it's a different dragon lame

3118
05:36:23,509 --> 05:36:24,709
Wait, it's not

3119
05:36:24,709 --> 05:36:26,709
It's not a dragon

3120
05:36:30,790 --> 05:36:34,950
That was the fucking scariest thing i've ever seen in my life that was the scariest thing that's ever happened to me

3121
05:36:35,590 --> 05:36:42,389
It was like a 3d movie dude was coming out of the screen my like chest hurts. It actually was a 3d movie. Oh my god

3122
05:36:45,700 --> 05:36:48,459
I guess it was a dragon

3123
05:36:49,580 --> 05:36:55,240
Shit

3124
05:36:55,240 --> 05:36:57,240
Uh, are there two of them now?

3125
05:36:57,900 --> 05:36:59,580
No, I think it's just the one

3126
05:36:59,580 --> 05:37:19,240
Oh, he hurt his ankle

3127
05:37:19,240 --> 05:37:20,860
Watch out

3128
05:37:20,860 --> 05:37:22,860
He's gonna breathe the fire

3129
05:37:23,900 --> 05:37:32,860
This was not a glint stone dragon

3130
05:37:33,750 --> 05:37:35,750
He has a fucking billion health

3131
05:37:40,439 --> 05:37:43,400
I think this is the starting area first dragon you would normally fight

3132
05:37:46,310 --> 05:37:50,599
Why wouldn't gonna despawn?

3133
05:37:51,080 --> 05:37:54,709
No, it's not

3134
05:37:54,709 --> 05:37:56,709
Why you gotta be so negative?

3135
05:38:03,900 --> 05:38:06,580
And why are you not on the horse?

3136
05:38:06,659 --> 05:38:08,500
Are you trying to die?

3137
05:38:08,500 --> 05:38:10,900
I don't like fighting him on the horse

3138
05:38:10,900 --> 05:38:12,900
I get on the horse like when he moves

3139
05:38:15,099 --> 05:38:26,709
Trying to die

3140
05:38:26,709 --> 05:38:27,750
Hey

3141
05:38:27,750 --> 05:38:29,509
ready

3142
05:38:29,509 --> 05:38:30,709
Whack

3143
05:38:30,709 --> 05:38:46,970
He went way shorter than I thought

3144
05:38:52,569 --> 05:38:54,569
What the hell did I do that for?

3145
05:38:54,810 --> 05:38:59,369
It's a good thing we didn't aggro him into that like other boss enemy

3146
05:39:00,650 --> 05:39:03,369
No

3147
05:39:03,369 --> 05:39:04,490
He did

3148
05:39:04,490 --> 05:39:08,569
Does he get his health back? I don't think he does unless the co-op mod broke it

3149
05:39:10,099 --> 05:39:14,520
He does not

3150
05:39:14,520 --> 05:39:21,720
That can just happen

3151
05:39:21,720 --> 05:39:24,279
Oh my you gotta be fucking kidding me

3152
05:39:24,919 --> 05:39:26,119
Good luck

3153
05:39:26,119 --> 05:39:34,819
I've died to that enough times

3154
05:39:34,819 --> 05:39:36,819
Oh, I'm just gonna fly away again

3155
05:39:50,360 --> 05:39:52,360
Are you trying to duck behind them?

3156
05:39:52,439 --> 05:39:54,439
That was so funny

3157
05:39:54,599 --> 05:39:59,180
That should have worked and if it did you would have gotten a stamp of approval

3158
05:40:00,840 --> 05:40:03,459
That's so awesome

3159
05:40:04,419 --> 05:40:07,540
It was actually worth a try. You're right. Come on

3160
05:40:16,490 --> 05:40:18,490
Every cartoon i've ever watched

3161
05:40:19,130 --> 05:40:23,110
Means that should have worked

3162
05:40:23,110 --> 05:40:38,500
That's gonna get me isn't it?

3163
05:40:38,500 --> 05:40:47,590
He needs to stop

3164
05:40:47,669 --> 05:40:58,439
Glintstone dragon agil. Yeah, i'm gonna get hit he took one damage

3165
05:40:59,159 --> 05:41:01,159
I think it's because I was mid jump

3166
05:41:09,740 --> 05:41:11,099
Agil

3167
05:41:11,099 --> 05:41:11,900
Oh

3168
05:41:11,900 --> 05:41:12,939
Agil

3169
05:41:12,939 --> 05:41:15,159
Agil

3170
05:41:15,159 --> 05:41:16,680
Oh my god

3171
05:41:16,680 --> 05:41:18,680
He just just just

3172
05:41:19,139 --> 05:41:20,680
Lacerated your throat

3173
05:41:20,680 --> 05:41:22,490
Who's it?

3174
05:41:22,490 --> 05:41:26,810
Yeah, I would have had the health if this game allowed for rp and I could have hid behind that stump

3175
05:41:29,740 --> 05:41:35,459
That's too bad that that didn't work aim for the head genius. It's i'm not playing

3176
05:41:35,939 --> 05:41:37,939
We were spectating him playing

3177
05:41:40,419 --> 05:41:42,619
That wasn't me

3178
05:41:42,619 --> 05:41:45,819
Wait, are you talking about me? But I am a genius. Thank you

3179
05:41:49,959 --> 05:41:52,250
Okay, so

3180
05:41:52,250 --> 05:41:55,930
The key was behind him and I got more like golden seeds. There's a lot of good items behind him

3181
05:41:56,569 --> 05:41:58,569
Let's do that at least get the key

3182
05:41:59,299 --> 05:42:00,819
Don't hit his legs

3183
05:42:00,819 --> 05:42:07,049
Hey, I play my game the way you you play yours, you know, you play you know what I mean?

3184
05:42:07,049 --> 05:42:12,549
I'll play my game the way I want

3185
05:42:12,549 --> 05:42:15,029
Oh, it is the first dragon. That's why it's doing the intro

3186
05:42:24,459 --> 05:42:26,630
Oh agil

3187
05:42:27,110 --> 05:42:28,470
Agil

3188
05:42:28,470 --> 05:43:03,509
I don't know if people know this but his head's actually up in the air and it's not on the ground at all times. You can't

3189
05:43:04,310 --> 05:43:06,540
Always hit his head

3190
05:43:06,540 --> 05:43:08,540
Because it's raised above the ground

3191
05:43:11,110 --> 05:43:13,110
A lot of the time well, you don't know anything

3192
05:43:50,729 --> 05:44:27,720
What did you just do to my fucking best friend trying to get him right in the face that move sucks that move sucks bad

3193
05:44:34,139 --> 05:44:35,580
uh

3194
05:44:35,580 --> 05:44:39,020
Coward

3195
05:44:39,020 --> 05:44:42,220
Coward before me

3196
05:44:42,220 --> 05:44:47,080
Is that a world of warcraft reference?

3197
05:44:48,360 --> 05:44:54,040
Is that what Illidan says?

3198
05:44:54,040 --> 05:44:56,360
That was not as deep as I wanted it to be

3199
05:44:57,659 --> 05:44:59,659
I let me try that one more time

3200
05:45:00,729 --> 05:45:05,849
Coward before me way better and a thousand times better than the first one

3201
05:45:07,110 --> 05:45:09,509
That is not that was what you were supposed to hear

3202
05:45:10,150 --> 05:45:12,150
But instead you heard something else

3203
05:45:13,020 --> 05:45:17,020
Okay, what is it? What's the reference old timer? I don't know. It was an orc

3204
05:45:19,990 --> 05:45:21,590
But it is world of warcraft

3205
05:45:21,590 --> 05:45:25,479
maybe

3206
05:45:25,479 --> 05:45:31,619
I I don't

3207
05:45:35,290 --> 05:45:39,049
The first one was the first one was cookie monster

3208
05:45:45,959 --> 05:45:47,959
What the hell was that move?

3209
05:45:48,439 --> 05:45:49,560
Oh god

3210
05:45:49,560 --> 05:45:57,180
We're almost got it almost got it almost got it

3211
05:46:01,110 --> 05:46:03,110
There's something in my face

3212
05:46:09,849 --> 05:46:13,849
Don't breathe fire this way don't breathe don't breathe fire this way. That's the slam

3213
05:46:21,720 --> 05:46:27,909
Oh, that was a good hit

3214
05:46:27,909 --> 05:46:31,750
I knew he was I was fucking greedy. I was like i'm just gonna hit him the one time

3215
05:46:32,389 --> 05:46:34,389
And germa's also gonna be dealing damage

3216
05:46:35,189 --> 05:46:37,189
There's no way he's gonna get another attack off

3217
05:46:37,909 --> 05:46:47,419
Hey noticed uh

3218
05:46:47,419 --> 05:46:52,099
You were kind of like looking at me and my buddy over here. I think you like fucking such hot shit

3219
05:46:54,020 --> 05:46:56,020
Thanks for help fighting the dragon

3220
05:46:57,529 --> 05:47:04,139
Dick

3221
05:47:04,139 --> 05:47:05,500
I did nothing

3222
05:47:05,500 --> 05:47:07,930
He's watched

3223
05:47:07,930 --> 05:47:10,119
That that's

3224
05:47:10,119 --> 05:47:12,139
the dragon trainer

3225
05:47:12,139 --> 05:47:14,389
Dude, that was his dragon

3226
05:47:14,389 --> 05:47:19,029
And why wouldn't he be over here going like no, what have you done to my dragon?

3227
05:47:19,669 --> 05:47:24,520
because he's actually

3228
05:47:24,520 --> 05:47:25,959
kind of relieved

3229
05:47:25,959 --> 05:47:27,959
Because his dad was a dragon trainer

3230
05:47:28,520 --> 05:47:30,520
And he didn't really ever want the job

3231
05:47:31,740 --> 05:47:33,740
But there's someone's gotta take care of it

3232
05:47:35,590 --> 05:47:37,590
How many of you guys here like hate my guts?

3233
05:47:41,049 --> 05:47:43,049
Why what?

3234
05:47:43,450 --> 05:47:46,009
I keep doing like these like stupid voices

3235
05:47:47,770 --> 05:47:52,700
All right, where we going i'm dead right now

3236
05:47:52,700 --> 05:47:58,619
So I need a rest you're kind of in control of the whole the whole situation and you're just killing the mana

3237
05:47:59,340 --> 05:48:02,919
dumb beetle

3238
05:48:02,919 --> 05:48:10,099
Do you need more mana? No, we're ready to do it dude. I can't vote i'm fucking dead

3239
05:48:12,790 --> 05:48:14,790
So I have to run all the way back here

3240
05:48:14,790 --> 05:48:17,029
I guess it's so far

3241
05:48:19,000 --> 05:48:21,319
If we're saying there was the lb, there's no lb

3242
05:48:21,880 --> 05:48:25,799
Oh, you have to run all the way over there. Oh, come on guys

3243
05:48:28,729 --> 05:48:31,130
It's not even a good impression of me I would have laughed if it was good

3244
05:48:32,630 --> 05:48:35,110
It wasn't you you think everything's about you

3245
05:48:35,669 --> 05:48:38,150
That way that wasn't you doing what I was just doing

3246
05:48:38,729 --> 05:48:41,529
It was me doing what you were doing, but it wasn't me being you

3247
05:48:41,849 --> 05:48:46,250
Okay, let's go up to lucario now that we have the actual key. I'm very confused of what you just said

3248
05:48:46,490 --> 05:49:06,310
Let's do it. What's this pole?

3249
05:49:19,049 --> 05:49:21,560
I walked in the castle already

3250
05:49:21,560 --> 05:49:25,240
Why would you do that now? I don't even have control of the character. I turned into an npc

3251
05:49:26,599 --> 05:49:34,020
Yeah, I might have fucked things up really think through you stop rushing. What the hell. How big is that hand back there?

3252
05:49:35,290 --> 05:49:37,290
There's a hand that big in this game

3253
05:49:38,580 --> 05:49:39,939
You've never seen that

3254
05:49:39,939 --> 05:49:41,939
No, it's a secret boss

3255
05:49:42,020 --> 05:49:48,900
I actually do mean that it actually is like a secret boss funny thing a tidbit about this actual secret boss in the game. It drops

3256
05:49:49,459 --> 05:49:55,610
Nothing. There's no reason to kill it. It doesn't do anything normally. Um,

3257
05:49:56,409 --> 05:49:59,529
I it's in there's like a some overpass where it's kind of hanging

3258
05:49:59,770 --> 05:50:04,330
It doesn't it's it's like a useless enemy to kill. I forget where it is

3259
05:50:05,180 --> 05:50:07,020
It's like a narrow

3260
05:50:07,020 --> 05:50:09,340
Place and it's like an overpass and it drops down in the mountains

3261
05:50:09,419 --> 05:50:15,799
Yeah, I remember when it when I finding it was like holy shit. Oh my god and then killing it

3262
05:50:15,799 --> 05:50:26,229
It was it didn't not even like a butterfly nothing. It has no loot table. Wow, stand up fix your posture for god's sakes

3263
05:50:27,590 --> 05:50:42,979
I'm tired 19 percent of you are hate watching me right now. Oh shit

3264
05:50:44,979 --> 05:50:50,680
Say something say something that they'll hate. No, I don't want to do that. That's what they're here for

3265
05:50:50,840 --> 05:50:54,840
How could it be only 19? That sounds pretty that sounds pretty low

3266
05:50:55,479 --> 05:50:59,900
Oh god

3267
05:51:03,990 --> 05:51:15,509
This guy has a lot of help I got you I got you. Oh you okay. What?

3268
05:51:16,599 --> 05:51:20,759
I think you're underestimating how strong this guy is. He's pretty strong. I don't see

3269
05:51:24,009 --> 05:51:31,159
He's pretty strong

3270
05:51:33,930 --> 05:51:39,659
Oh, what the fuck I was trying to match it I came like lagged

3271
05:51:41,029 --> 05:51:56,900
Where are you? I died. I'm coming back. Oh, oh you didn't like spectate. No, I just did didn't give me the option to

3272
05:51:57,299 --> 05:51:59,930
Okay. Am I waiting for you?

3273
05:52:00,810 --> 05:52:07,220
You have an e-buff. Oh, whatever. We'll be fine. He has like 700 damage glen stone. We're fine

3274
05:52:07,779 --> 05:52:16,729
It's like a bonfire up here

3275
05:52:16,729 --> 05:52:20,729
Seeing this place for the first time from the outside was awesome. This guy had me huge blood-borne vibes

3276
05:52:31,990 --> 05:52:36,549
Okay, I think I am I am now the decent like are you some weird shit?

3277
05:52:37,430 --> 05:52:40,569
Okay, what's in here seems better now?

3278
05:52:41,430 --> 05:52:42,709
um

3279
05:52:42,709 --> 05:52:48,229
This is a classic run through this room and pretend it doesn't exist. I don't even care what the enemies are. Okay

3280
05:52:49,959 --> 05:53:05,509
and let's rest

3281
05:53:06,069 --> 05:53:10,680
Oh, why do you still have 18 000 viewers? I don't know

3282
05:53:11,479 --> 05:53:15,400
Yeah, I think I think I did leave like 17 000 souls at the dragon boss

3283
05:53:15,880 --> 05:53:20,119
It gave it to me after I died so I thought I would respond with them because the weird co-op stuff

3284
05:53:20,919 --> 05:53:24,810
I think I gotta go back

3285
05:53:25,590 --> 05:53:29,189
Yeah, I got we gotta go. I gotta go pick this. Yeah, they're gonna go pick this up

3286
05:53:29,509 --> 05:53:33,590
Yeah, there were 18 000 souls in the ground. That's you had that that's a lot

3287
05:53:34,310 --> 05:53:36,470
Yeah, it's a lot. So i'm voting

3288
05:53:37,270 --> 05:53:39,430
I'm asking kindly once again if we're

3289
05:53:40,470 --> 05:53:47,000
to the temple quarter, um

3290
05:53:47,560 --> 05:53:49,560
Where is that just south of us?

3291
05:53:50,040 --> 05:53:58,650
Oh, oh, oh, oh I see what you mean. I didn't I I thought for a second

3292
05:53:58,650 --> 05:54:05,220
I thought you're talking about the dragon area. Oh, yeah the dragon area. I don't know why this is called like temple

3293
05:54:05,299 --> 05:54:26,549
There's no temple you got what you needed

3294
05:54:27,610 --> 05:54:32,090
Yeah, let me go back to uh

3295
05:54:33,740 --> 05:54:55,880
Church of the cuckoo. Are you insecure right now? No, i'm just chilling. I'm having fun. Don't worry about me. I'm good

3296
05:54:56,439 --> 05:55:02,229
What do you what would you be insecure about the cookie monster voice that I did like 10 minutes ago? Oh

3297
05:55:04,540 --> 05:55:09,340
You did do a you did do a pretty weird marge like three hours ago as well. That was actually good though

3298
05:55:09,500 --> 05:55:11,319
That's the difference

3299
05:55:11,319 --> 05:55:13,319
I don't care if a voice if a voice sucks

3300
05:55:13,720 --> 05:55:18,040
And it's stupid and it's like cringy that a human would do it in front of like a stadium full of people

3301
05:55:18,700 --> 05:55:20,700
That's fine. As long as it was good

3302
05:55:21,479 --> 05:55:23,479
You cannot go back and tell me wait

3303
05:55:23,799 --> 05:55:25,000
what

3304
05:55:25,000 --> 05:55:29,479
Is it like I don't know by definition if it was cringy then it also wasn't good. No

3305
05:55:30,439 --> 05:55:33,319
It was it was an almost flawless marge simpson

3306
05:55:34,119 --> 05:55:36,439
But that was like kind of cringy to do that. Don't you think?

3307
05:55:38,220 --> 05:55:39,500
Uh, no

3308
05:55:39,500 --> 05:55:41,500
Oh, all right, then there's no argument here

3309
05:55:42,220 --> 05:55:45,020
Yeah, i'm just gonna let that guy we're just gonna like oh it's mambo

3310
05:55:45,819 --> 05:55:48,380
Yeah, mambo number five

3311
05:55:48,380 --> 05:56:11,750
Everybody loves mambo. I thought that was a giant sheep. I'm tanking it. I'm tanking it. I'm tanking it

3312
05:56:13,340 --> 05:56:14,380
um

3313
05:56:14,380 --> 05:56:17,189
Will you one of us is falling off this?

3314
05:56:17,909 --> 05:56:20,470
I'm tanking this i'm tanking that was so sad

3315
05:56:23,779 --> 05:56:25,779
Thank you. I'm tanking it. I'm tanking it

3316
05:56:26,180 --> 05:56:32,180
I'm taking it out mambo

3317
05:56:39,830 --> 05:56:41,990
I hate I don't want to kill mambo, but we kind of have to

3318
05:56:42,549 --> 05:56:45,500
Why is ever why why does every creature have a name?

3319
05:56:46,759 --> 05:56:48,119
uh

3320
05:56:48,119 --> 05:56:49,560
when you played

3321
05:56:49,560 --> 05:56:51,560
Through the first time what did you use for a spirit summon?

3322
05:56:55,400 --> 05:56:58,459
mimic tier

3323
05:56:58,459 --> 05:57:00,459
Yes, I ruined my first playthrough

3324
05:57:01,180 --> 05:57:03,700
that's oh

3325
05:57:03,700 --> 05:57:07,060
Look, it's not that that's not a big deal

3326
05:57:07,220 --> 05:57:10,259
I didn't use the spirit summon all game until I found that and then my chat was like

3327
05:57:11,060 --> 05:57:12,259
I was like what?

3328
05:57:12,259 --> 05:57:19,540
I watched my mimic tier kill morgot without me even playing the game and then I kind of felt like oh, this is not

3329
05:57:20,630 --> 05:57:24,229
I remember do you guys remember that it was like wow morgot. Oh my god

3330
05:57:24,229 --> 05:57:30,310
This is so epic and he just killed him without even playing and it felt really I was like, oh, I didn't even really do anything

3331
05:57:32,360 --> 05:57:33,240
I

3332
05:57:33,240 --> 05:57:36,599
I can't remember there was like one boss that I let my mimic tier fight on their own

3333
05:57:37,319 --> 05:57:40,759
And I was like, I don't even feel bad about that. I didn't feel like fighting this boss

3334
05:57:41,560 --> 05:57:47,720
Well, the reason why I say that is because the snake that enemy we just fought is what is going on

3335
05:57:47,799 --> 05:57:52,599
What is this guy doing? It's super frozen. Do you think i'm getting what you were talking about before?

3336
05:57:57,130 --> 05:58:02,169
Uh, I upgraded that snake that with the fire whip to plus 10. That's what I used the whole game

3337
05:58:04,279 --> 05:58:06,200
His name was mambo

3338
05:58:06,200 --> 05:58:09,000
I also ignored I completely ignored the mechanic

3339
05:58:11,639 --> 05:58:16,540
That's a big bird

3340
05:58:16,540 --> 05:58:18,540
What would you say is uh?

3341
05:58:21,259 --> 05:58:23,659
Did you hate elden beast like everybody else did

3342
05:58:25,459 --> 05:58:26,419
um

3343
05:58:26,419 --> 05:58:33,459
Kind of yeah, I don't know this very many people that oh my god. Okay. Hold on. This thing could kill us both

3344
05:58:38,919 --> 05:58:41,080
Uh, this thing has so much health

3345
05:58:42,630 --> 05:58:44,630
I think we just run. Yeah, we have to run I think

3346
05:58:47,750 --> 05:58:57,080
Don't go over there. What use the you can't move

3347
05:58:57,959 --> 05:58:59,959
Oh my god

3348
05:59:05,779 --> 05:59:10,500
Help i'm just i'm going across the bridge man. I don't want to sing you i'm asking god

3349
05:59:11,139 --> 05:59:16,389
get shit

3350
05:59:16,389 --> 05:59:18,869
I'm telling you just come across the bridge. We don't have to fucking kill this thing

3351
05:59:19,669 --> 05:59:21,669
Oh, okay. All right. All right

3352
05:59:35,020 --> 05:59:37,400
I'm fine

3353
05:59:37,400 --> 05:59:42,619
This is so stressful

3354
05:59:42,619 --> 05:59:45,740
Why is this guy disappearing with magic? Did you see what what?

3355
05:59:46,380 --> 05:59:47,900
I didn't see

3356
05:59:47,900 --> 05:59:49,900
Where did this come from help?

3357
06:00:11,110 --> 06:00:13,830
Are you still alive?

3358
06:00:13,830 --> 06:00:19,130
Yeah, how did you live through that I don't understand I I stood back and watched nothing aggro'd to me

3359
06:00:23,799 --> 06:00:25,799
Uh, but what are you doing?

3360
06:00:26,840 --> 06:00:31,380
Uh, should I rest?

3361
06:00:31,380 --> 06:00:34,330
Wait, where's the bonfire? Oh, do you want me to reset it?

3362
06:00:36,380 --> 06:00:38,259
uh

3363
06:00:38,259 --> 06:00:42,419
Sure, I think we need to do like a legit reset because it's desyncing a lot. I

3364
06:00:42,979 --> 06:00:48,740
Don't close the game yet because my I have 20 000 souls that are on the ground out there

3365
06:00:49,299 --> 06:00:51,299
Oh, okay

3366
06:00:52,099 --> 06:00:58,259
All right, all right this guy this guy is fucking crazy man. Well, just ignore just ignore him. Okay. All right

3367
06:01:11,830 --> 06:01:16,310
Oh, it's the teleporting glintstone guys. Is that what you meant? He actually teleports

3368
06:01:21,110 --> 06:01:23,509
Oh gosh, do I am I gonna get those?

3369
06:01:24,790 --> 06:01:25,990
Here you

3370
06:01:25,990 --> 06:01:29,349
You can go around the side my game crashed. Oh, thank god is beck

3371
06:01:31,270 --> 06:01:33,590
There's still dude. There's still an angry dude down here

3372
06:01:39,529 --> 06:01:42,409
Okay, I am now ready to sever the connection

3373
06:01:44,090 --> 06:01:46,090
We got let's get the next bonfire

3374
06:01:49,000 --> 06:01:51,000
Uh, okay. I'm gonna follow your lead

3375
06:01:51,479 --> 06:01:56,119
Okay

3376
06:01:56,119 --> 06:01:58,119
Yeah, we're desyncing so hard

3377
06:01:58,700 --> 06:02:00,700
Watch it. We're gonna just jump and run

3378
06:02:19,270 --> 06:02:20,790
my god

3379
06:02:20,790 --> 06:02:26,979
Don't drop those souls. I'm not i'm holding them

3380
06:02:32,819 --> 06:02:34,970
Excuse me

3381
06:02:34,970 --> 06:02:36,970
What don't you what's happening? Okay

3382
06:02:38,759 --> 06:02:45,080
Sir, I need you to communicate with me clearly. Why would you am I should I go up there with you? Yeah, that's where my next bonfire is

3383
06:02:49,000 --> 06:03:09,639
Don't follow me. Did you forget everything? No, I I remember but he's just moving so fast. He's moving too quickly

3384
06:03:10,200 --> 06:03:13,799
Oh, sorry. I'll slow down. I'll wear some heavy armor

3385
06:03:15,020 --> 06:03:24,360
All right. So do you want to actually do like a reset? Yeah, I'm gonna do like a quit the main menu and we'll restart

3386
06:03:24,439 --> 06:03:27,080
You know, I don't think we need to restart the whole game. No, I don't think so

3387
06:03:30,360 --> 06:03:32,360
Like I have to banish you

3388
06:03:33,479 --> 06:03:35,479
Yeah, leave us alone

3389
06:03:36,119 --> 06:03:38,950
What is doing that?

3390
06:03:38,950 --> 06:03:41,740
And then I banished you

3391
06:03:41,740 --> 06:03:43,580
I hope you spent your souls

3392
06:03:43,580 --> 06:03:47,099
I did but I um, am I gonna get those back?

3393
06:03:47,580 --> 06:03:56,169
This eighty six hundred they're gonna be right here, right? Yeah. Sure. Yeah, they're okay. We're good

3394
06:03:56,810 --> 06:04:10,840
You look like you're in a painting

3395
06:04:10,840 --> 06:04:31,139
Cool. I am ready whenever you are in fact

3396
06:04:31,220 --> 06:04:33,779
I'm just gonna get out of the way because this thing's gonna keep doing that isn't it?

3397
06:04:33,860 --> 06:04:38,419
Yeah, I put my thing down. I'm gonna try and kill it in the real world, which is my world

3398
06:04:39,540 --> 06:04:47,349
Do something funny. I'm falling asleep

3399
06:04:48,919 --> 06:04:52,439
Did you just not see the the insanity of the last five minutes

3400
06:04:53,080 --> 06:04:57,639
Maybe if you're falling asleep, you should go to sleep and actually get a good tonight. Good night. Good night. Rest

3401
06:04:58,599 --> 06:05:02,200
I feel like I feel like we screamed at least five or six times each

3402
06:05:07,000 --> 06:05:09,000
What why are you asleep?

3403
06:05:09,319 --> 06:05:24,040
I'm really used to the screaming by now. So it's not that big of a deal

3404
06:05:24,840 --> 06:05:26,840
Don't do that though

3405
06:05:26,840 --> 06:05:28,840
Oh, that was the wake-up call

3406
06:05:28,919 --> 06:05:31,720
Get in here. There's a chest back here. You're running away wrong way

3407
06:05:32,360 --> 06:05:34,599
You're kind of just freaking out dude. I'm fine

3408
06:05:35,799 --> 06:05:42,500
Don't you want the sick loot? Sure. I got immutable shield

3409
06:05:43,990 --> 06:05:48,069
A little bit of witchcraft the first stone sword key. I found the whole game pretty cool

3410
06:05:48,630 --> 06:05:51,159
And you get the chest

3411
06:05:51,159 --> 06:05:55,319
This chest right there. Yeah

3412
06:05:55,319 --> 06:05:56,680
golden rune

3413
06:05:56,680 --> 06:06:17,529
Pretty cool. Have a pizza

3414
06:06:18,330 --> 06:06:20,330
party

3415
06:06:30,060 --> 06:06:34,139
Have a piece I could go for a pizza

3416
06:06:34,939 --> 06:06:40,500
Hmm somber ancient dragon smoothing stone. We actually just did that

3417
06:06:44,299 --> 06:06:48,220
There's a lot of hidden walls here well

3418
06:06:49,450 --> 06:06:51,049
now

3419
06:06:51,049 --> 06:06:59,209
The game really begins because I just got horror loser remembrance. This is like a hundred thousand souls. Nice find. That's a good find

3420
06:06:59,770 --> 06:07:06,520
That's a pretty good find. That's also a good find but it's faith, isn't it?

3421
06:07:07,319 --> 06:07:10,099
Stupid bubble thing

3422
06:07:10,099 --> 06:07:12,099
But that's just not good

3423
06:07:16,419 --> 06:07:18,310
Get the axe

3424
06:07:18,310 --> 06:07:20,889
Get the axe get the axe don't do the remembrance

3425
06:07:27,430 --> 06:07:31,259
Is the axe good? I don't remember it. I feel like the weapon art was kind of lame on it

3426
06:07:32,220 --> 06:07:40,470
Maybe it scales really well

3427
06:07:42,020 --> 06:07:44,099
All right, it's this one here, right

3428
06:07:44,099 --> 06:07:46,099
It's the one that has no books, right?

3429
06:07:50,810 --> 06:07:55,049
I don't know. I think this is another one of those things that maybe only ever did one time. Yeah, it's over

3430
06:07:55,770 --> 06:07:57,209
This place is wacky

3431
06:07:57,209 --> 06:08:00,900
It's like three or four ways to go in secret walls

3432
06:08:04,020 --> 06:08:09,939
Ooh, I think that's all right

3433
06:08:09,939 --> 06:08:16,340
Then come over here the items you get from the boss souls are also randomized. Oh, that's all right

3434
06:08:16,340 --> 06:08:18,659
Well, i'm just gonna break it then just put strength true

3435
06:08:19,139 --> 06:08:28,360
Okay, cool. And by the way, um

3436
06:08:29,540 --> 06:08:32,259
Interesting to note nothing up here, but uh jump over here

3437
06:08:33,290 --> 06:08:37,689
Take a look at that

3438
06:08:37,689 --> 06:08:38,650
Mm-hmm

3439
06:08:38,650 --> 06:08:43,740
And I think there's another thing we can do here any secrets in here. Uh, no down another one

3440
06:08:44,470 --> 06:08:50,380
Any secrets in here? Yes. Whoa

3441
06:08:51,590 --> 06:08:53,590
Oh, you were actually fighting something. Mm-hmm

3442
06:08:57,209 --> 06:09:01,930
This is the big thing here and I think this is one of the best scaling staff in the game, right?

3443
06:09:02,650 --> 06:09:04,650
Um, there's one of those witches in here

3444
06:09:08,580 --> 06:09:12,259
This thing actually is gonna this thing hurts a lot from what I remember

3445
06:09:12,900 --> 06:09:18,950
It's got one eight feet

3446
06:09:18,950 --> 06:09:20,950
Yeah, i've never come down here. Really?

3447
06:09:21,590 --> 06:09:23,029
I think I remember

3448
06:09:23,029 --> 06:09:27,669
Trying to find this one. So I don't think I uh, I did the whole floor thing that you just did

3449
06:09:27,830 --> 06:09:31,909
I think I found the first secret door. That's also really good the magma sword

3450
06:09:32,310 --> 06:09:33,430
It's faith

3451
06:09:33,430 --> 06:09:40,229
Sure, maybe I should do faith. I don't know but this thing is the the sword. Yeah

3452
06:09:41,459 --> 06:09:45,450
That thing is really good

3453
06:09:45,450 --> 06:09:52,900
I get to be the magma worm

3454
06:09:52,900 --> 06:09:56,099
I have a lot of souls to lose. So let's beat her first try

3455
06:09:58,580 --> 06:10:00,580
This is going to be a really easy boss

3456
06:10:04,970 --> 06:10:06,970
How is this going to work with the bubble stuff?

3457
06:10:11,689 --> 06:10:15,529
What it's not that's not him this isn't a

3458
06:10:16,490 --> 06:10:19,610
This is an imposter why is he wearing this default?

3459
06:10:21,830 --> 06:10:23,830
He's just he's just a guy

3460
06:10:24,630 --> 06:10:27,990
He's in like a ray of lucaria with like the stone helmet thing

3461
06:10:29,450 --> 06:10:31,450
He's just a normal guy

3462
06:10:37,689 --> 06:10:41,529
Oh, no, this is where this is not. Um, this is the dog

3463
06:10:45,689 --> 06:10:53,590
Usually yeah

3464
06:10:53,590 --> 06:10:54,790
He healed

3465
06:10:54,790 --> 06:10:55,990
He cheated

3466
06:10:55,990 --> 06:10:58,840
Next time him

3467
06:10:58,840 --> 06:11:07,419
Oh be careful my friend

3468
06:11:07,580 --> 06:11:12,060
And nothing left in that flask

3469
06:11:22,299 --> 06:11:27,639
Okay, we got him

3470
06:11:27,639 --> 06:11:29,900
Gideon off near of radigan

3471
06:11:33,159 --> 06:11:35,159
He couldn't pick a character either I don't know

3472
06:11:37,180 --> 06:11:53,610
What everything I guess i'll be sir gideon off near of radigan the brave the wise actually

3473
06:12:02,069 --> 06:12:11,189
Yeah, do I go full on just absolute insane mode here? What is absolute insane mode?

3474
06:12:11,189 --> 06:12:17,720
Could you break that down for people who are unfamiliar? It is me doing the horror loot remembrance and getting like 120 000 souls

3475
06:12:18,520 --> 06:12:21,560
You should go super hard here

3476
06:12:21,560 --> 06:12:23,159
No mercy

3477
06:12:23,159 --> 06:12:24,810
That's it

3478
06:12:24,810 --> 06:12:31,700
Wait, I thought it was way more than that. Isn't that one of the last bosses in the whole game?

3479
06:12:33,779 --> 06:12:38,009
Yeah, I thought it was like 100k. How much how much did you get 30k?

3480
06:12:40,259 --> 06:12:46,759
That might be scaled then is it scaled? Okay. Well because yeah, here should be like 80

3481
06:12:49,240 --> 06:12:50,680
It's 80k

3482
06:12:50,680 --> 06:12:53,220
For elden 30k though. All right, whatever

3483
06:12:58,409 --> 06:13:03,529
What a useless amount of knowledge that i've held in the back of my brain for like a year to be like yeah

3484
06:13:03,610 --> 06:13:05,939
I think horror lose is 80 000

3485
06:13:06,500 --> 06:13:09,139
And apparently be right and I use this

3486
06:13:09,939 --> 06:13:19,029
This thing is crazy

3487
06:13:19,029 --> 06:13:28,709
Oh, you got the fucking sexy girl hat. Yep. Sorry. I have it. She's not even real

3488
06:13:31,799 --> 06:13:34,919
It's starting to look more and more like the character. I actually played the game with

3489
06:13:35,479 --> 06:13:51,080
Oh, is the ball still here? I wonder if the ball is something else. I challenge you to combat. It's an interesting group

3490
06:14:24,099 --> 06:14:26,099
Now i'm now i'm fucking

3491
06:14:27,259 --> 06:14:29,500
Stand back. I've got the new fall season

3492
06:14:31,189 --> 06:14:41,060
um

3493
06:14:41,060 --> 06:14:43,540
Will you this is wait, this is a sheep here

3494
06:14:45,020 --> 06:14:47,979
Yeah, usually I think there's like bunny rabbits, but the the normal

3495
06:14:48,619 --> 06:14:50,619
Enemies are replaced

3496
06:14:51,830 --> 06:14:56,950
You know what i'm saying, you know, you know, like i'm not gonna finish the sentence. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. It's an arm

3497
06:14:57,509 --> 06:15:03,080
troll knight sword

3498
06:15:03,080 --> 06:15:05,700
I like that weapon

3499
06:15:06,099 --> 06:15:08,099
But I probably don't have the strength to use it

3500
06:15:08,259 --> 06:15:16,970
Probably not. So do you want to go walk around and get all the wacky shit here or do you want to just kill?

3501
06:15:17,450 --> 06:15:19,450
Uh ray lucario and get out of here

3502
06:15:20,340 --> 06:15:22,360
um

3503
06:15:22,360 --> 06:15:24,360
This area is so big. I just want to kill

3504
06:15:24,759 --> 06:15:26,439
uh lucario

3505
06:15:26,439 --> 06:15:34,389
Do you want to check back here real quick? It's just a sprint. Why is one of those usually a bunch of items?

3506
06:15:35,110 --> 06:15:44,779
The mosquito is biting me

3507
06:15:44,779 --> 06:15:46,779
Oh shit, I got the sacramental bud

3508
06:15:48,919 --> 06:15:50,919
I got regular club

3509
06:15:51,000 --> 06:15:54,470
Anything else back here?

3510
06:15:54,470 --> 06:15:56,970
Uh, there's one item around the back

3511
06:15:57,369 --> 06:15:59,930
And we got a a tree over here

3512
06:16:01,619 --> 06:16:05,540
stop

3513
06:16:05,540 --> 06:16:07,540
a little bit of a ritual pot

3514
06:16:23,130 --> 06:16:25,130
Oh, I thought there could only be one barf. Oh

3515
06:16:25,689 --> 06:16:27,130
What happened to that?

3516
06:16:27,130 --> 06:16:29,130
I just wanted to see what it looked like

3517
06:16:29,209 --> 06:16:30,009
Okay

3518
06:16:30,009 --> 06:16:42,169
I'm putting on this thing again

3519
06:16:43,500 --> 06:16:46,779
Yeah

3520
06:16:46,779 --> 06:16:48,299
Okay, i'm just going

3521
06:16:48,299 --> 06:16:50,540
You're a fraud

3522
06:16:50,540 --> 06:16:52,860
me

3523
06:16:52,860 --> 06:16:56,540
No, i'm just gonna come out of nowhere and call me a fraud

3524
06:16:56,939 --> 06:16:58,939
You're a fraud. You know that

3525
06:17:00,330 --> 06:17:02,490
Well, i've got an epic loot here. I gotta get that one

3526
06:17:04,659 --> 06:17:06,659
um

3527
06:17:09,299 --> 06:17:11,060
Thank god I wasn't

3528
06:17:11,060 --> 06:17:19,560
Okay, the ball's still here. What does starlight shards even do? I forget which way it goes at the end

3529
06:17:20,810 --> 06:17:21,849
same

3530
06:17:21,849 --> 06:17:34,060
Mm-hmm. I've never gone down that way. I died. Why can I see everything?

3531
06:17:35,659 --> 06:17:47,529
Uh, oh because you reset it. You want to wait for you?

3532
06:17:48,549 --> 06:17:50,299
Yeah

3533
06:17:50,299 --> 06:18:07,979
Be careful

3534
06:18:07,979 --> 06:18:10,779
I I have to go down to the bottom. There's an item dude

3535
06:18:11,419 --> 06:18:12,939
It's a purple

3536
06:18:12,939 --> 06:18:19,580
I thought that was gonna kill you

3537
06:18:19,580 --> 06:18:21,659
me too

3538
06:18:21,740 --> 06:18:23,740
The the guy with the hat

3539
06:18:33,990 --> 06:18:35,990
Where does this teleporter take you? I forget

3540
06:18:36,819 --> 06:18:43,419
Um, I also forget

3541
06:18:44,060 --> 06:18:48,540
What do you mean you forgot? This is it's not like this is like a 200 hour game with

3542
06:18:49,319 --> 06:18:52,860
Thousands of locations and and and potentially millions of different things to see

3543
06:18:53,900 --> 06:18:57,979
It might take you inside volcano near the volcano manor. I think so

3544
06:19:02,279 --> 06:19:07,479
Or I think that one takes you somewhere stupid but there is one in like those locked rooms that takes you to

3545
06:19:07,880 --> 06:19:10,680
There we have like a car we have literally I actually have a comedy guy

3546
06:19:12,549 --> 06:19:19,549
He doesn't have a weapon. He just has the shield the weapon is a shield weapon. No, wait, he's he's got pyromancy

3547
06:19:22,380 --> 06:19:24,380
Killing me with comedy

3548
06:19:24,700 --> 06:19:33,860
Oh my god, that hurt a lot

3549
06:19:33,860 --> 06:19:42,229
Where did this person come from?

3550
06:19:42,229 --> 06:19:47,130
I don't know. Why don't you ask them? I got moon veil

3551
06:19:48,180 --> 06:19:50,009
I used that for a while

3552
06:19:50,009 --> 06:19:55,709
Uh, i've actually never used it. I would be curious to try it. It's really fun because i'm intelligent

3553
06:19:56,590 --> 06:20:02,029
You can uh, let's just make sure we don't get jumped on here. This is one of those awful enemies, isn't it?

3554
06:20:03,229 --> 06:20:04,110
No

3555
06:20:04,110 --> 06:20:09,040
It was one of the sad pathetic losers

3556
06:20:14,080 --> 06:20:18,639
Uh, everybody is gonna hate you for using it because it's like it was like the broken meta weapon

3557
06:20:18,639 --> 06:20:21,119
But it's actually very fun to use the weapon arts are awesome

3558
06:20:21,759 --> 06:20:28,040
I really like do like the crescent moon slash thingy. Yeah, i'm not gonna use it unless I can upgrade it but

3559
06:20:28,599 --> 06:20:32,810
I'll keep it in mind

3560
06:20:32,810 --> 06:20:37,849
I mean hasn't this game have like a whole bunch of balance passes. Is it still like oh you gotta get moon veil

3561
06:20:39,500 --> 06:20:41,500
I think they nerfed it, but

3562
06:20:41,819 --> 06:20:45,229
It doesn't matter

3563
06:20:45,229 --> 06:20:47,229
I'm really low on uh healing

3564
06:20:47,549 --> 06:20:49,549
For this this is a good idea. Should we?

3565
06:20:50,270 --> 06:20:51,709
I mean

3566
06:20:51,709 --> 06:20:54,270
We don't know what boss it even is I keep like we get here and it's like oh, yeah

3567
06:20:54,270 --> 06:20:56,270
You gotta get ready for the I don't uh

3568
06:20:57,150 --> 06:21:01,259
This is where the game we're not gonna be able to beat this. Do you see what's up there?

3569
06:21:01,959 --> 06:21:05,560
No, I didn't you didn't see what was up there. I didn't see I didn't see

3570
06:21:06,200 --> 06:21:08,200
This is actually impossible

3571
06:21:09,240 --> 06:21:11,240
Good luck

3572
06:21:11,560 --> 06:21:13,560
This room is so small

3573
06:21:16,520 --> 06:21:22,000
Doesn't he do a foot?

3574
06:21:22,000 --> 06:21:24,959
Yeah, he fills the whole room dude. This is this is not going to be possible

3575
06:21:27,259 --> 06:21:29,259
This is not completable

3576
06:21:35,770 --> 06:21:37,770
All right, we're gonna have to figure out

3577
06:21:39,580 --> 06:21:43,659
We're just gonna need to scale so much we can kill him like yeah, yes him. Yep

3578
06:21:47,080 --> 06:21:50,200
We actually might be okay as long as it doesn't do that more than like four or five times

3579
06:21:51,000 --> 06:22:02,490
I have no healing so next one i'm dead. Oh boy

3580
06:22:08,319 --> 06:22:10,000
How did you not die?

3581
06:22:10,000 --> 06:22:15,369
I don't know

3582
06:22:15,369 --> 06:22:19,689
Hey

3583
06:22:19,689 --> 06:22:24,169
There's a lot of the optional shit like this where you had to do a lot like go through some weird amount of effort

3584
06:22:24,250 --> 06:22:27,529
To fight this boss. Yeah, I also another one. I never fought him

3585
06:22:29,159 --> 06:22:33,240
I feel like you missed a pretty large amount of the optional stuff in the game

3586
06:22:36,139 --> 06:22:38,939
The game's just that fucking big though. I really didn't

3587
06:22:40,240 --> 06:22:42,319
I keep saying. Oh, yeah, I never seen this but like

3588
06:22:43,119 --> 06:22:49,919
What do you want from me?

3589
06:22:49,919 --> 06:22:52,029
Who what?

3590
06:22:52,029 --> 06:22:54,029
You lagged on my screen

3591
06:22:54,029 --> 06:22:56,110
He like jumped backwards and his hand

3592
06:22:57,069 --> 06:22:59,069
Sliding me backwards hurt me

3593
06:22:59,229 --> 06:23:01,310
interesting thought from somebody in chat though is

3594
06:23:02,319 --> 06:23:11,080
This is phase one. We have to fight a different boss after this. I think i'm pretty sure that's not sure

3595
06:23:13,950 --> 06:23:19,819
There was an option in the randomizer for multi-phase bosses to like switch creatures between phases

3596
06:23:23,049 --> 06:23:28,009
Uh, hey, i'm i'm for it. Do you want to go again? It wasn't that bad. No, it wasn't that bad, but I

3597
06:23:28,970 --> 06:23:33,689
Um, can I can you I need to do more damage that big explosion because we can't avoid it

3598
06:23:33,689 --> 06:23:35,900
but maybe if you get like a

3599
06:23:35,900 --> 06:23:41,759
lightning resist shield I have

3600
06:23:43,310 --> 06:23:44,509
Uh

3601
06:23:44,509 --> 06:23:48,759
I have the crucible shield but it's gonna be so heavy. I don't think this even work

3602
06:23:49,709 --> 06:23:51,950
I can drop a shield for you with 34 lightning is

3603
06:23:52,509 --> 06:23:59,580
Like this thing says more. Okay, then i've i've just got a little baby light shields

3604
06:24:02,720 --> 06:24:04,240
Yeah, we can try that

3605
06:24:04,240 --> 06:24:07,360
He didn't have a lot of health and he doesn't that boss normally like

3606
06:24:08,240 --> 06:24:10,240
Teleport around in the sky

3607
06:24:10,240 --> 06:24:12,479
We might get in trouble there. We'll see

3608
06:24:13,659 --> 06:24:14,700
Uh

3609
06:24:14,700 --> 06:24:17,900
The one issue is I feel like i'm not doing very much damage with this. I need to upgrade it

3610
06:24:19,849 --> 06:24:26,729
Whatever. Fuck it. Let's go. We could uh quickly before we do the boss go to eg

3611
06:24:27,290 --> 06:24:31,209
And unlock that blacksmith like we've been talking about because we can just ride the horse straight up there now

3612
06:24:31,450 --> 06:24:41,369
Let's try it one or two more times. This is uh, this is one of the fun walkbacks. Yes it is

3613
06:24:42,090 --> 06:24:46,430
One of the most one of the most walkbacks of all dark souls

3614
06:24:48,880 --> 06:24:52,009
And we should probably get rid of the the bowl

3615
06:24:52,729 --> 06:25:01,709
I called it a bowl and i'm mad. We should probably get rid of the bowl. Oh the the bowl are you're teleporting around

3616
06:25:04,029 --> 06:25:06,509
Wait, okay. That was not fucking fair

3617
06:25:07,150 --> 06:25:08,830
That was not fair

3618
06:25:08,830 --> 06:25:35,560
That was not fair. I'm gonna die to random enemies. I just reset them. Yeah, forget where you even go to destroy the bowl

3619
06:25:36,119 --> 06:25:38,240
You gotta go up

3620
06:25:38,319 --> 06:25:46,669
Is uh outside this ladder I think it's actually out where that border is

3621
06:25:47,580 --> 06:25:51,819
I also think there's a shortcut on this side so you don't have to go that way, but it's still pretty long

3622
06:25:59,630 --> 06:26:09,950
There go 9 000 souls wonderful. What are you fighting out here?

3623
06:26:11,340 --> 06:26:12,779
little baby

3624
06:26:12,779 --> 06:26:18,720
Yeah, i've used like half of my flasks already. Well, let's we gotta do it then we have to beat it

3625
06:26:20,380 --> 06:26:32,200
I'm down to three

3626
06:26:32,200 --> 06:26:36,720
Okay, more like placid who sucks

3627
06:26:54,669 --> 06:26:56,669
Oh my goodness

3628
06:26:56,669 --> 06:27:18,669
Are you gonna do it? I'm so paranoid

3629
06:27:29,279 --> 06:27:37,450
Is it okay actually was not that bad if you if you tank it with the shield?

3630
06:27:37,930 --> 06:27:51,639
Yeah, that was pretty good. What's wrong with him? Uh, he's staggered. I'm stunning stabbing his face

3631
06:27:54,090 --> 06:28:00,830
face stabbed

3632
06:28:00,830 --> 06:28:02,430
um

3633
06:28:02,430 --> 06:28:08,490
What are you doing to teleport? Yeah, is this where he does the flying thing?

3634
06:28:15,580 --> 06:28:19,740
Oh my god, he's in the walls dude, this is gonna be impossible

3635
06:28:21,520 --> 06:28:23,520
He's in he goes in the walls

3636
06:28:34,669 --> 06:28:37,950
You're still yeah, your damage is really bad. It's terrible

3637
06:28:38,669 --> 06:28:47,599
How upgraded is that weapon plus one man? It's things a piece of fucking shit. This thing's a piece of shit

3638
06:28:48,990 --> 06:28:50,990
Upgrade a weapon

3639
06:28:51,069 --> 06:28:53,069
I am plus 16

3640
06:28:53,630 --> 06:28:56,880
What?

3641
06:28:56,880 --> 06:29:00,580
Hold on saying you what you're plus 16

3642
06:29:01,759 --> 06:29:06,880
Yes, how did you do that? How did you not hear me saying this two hours ago?

3643
06:29:07,840 --> 06:29:14,560
Like four or five times you're a plus 16 on you i'm plus one i'm plus

3644
06:29:16,080 --> 06:29:18,400
How do you have that many things? Wait a minute

3645
06:29:19,209 --> 06:29:27,849
Upgrade it only costs one per upgrade right back

3646
06:29:28,569 --> 06:29:32,169
That's why I wanted to go to the blacksmith. Don't go to the round table

3647
06:29:33,930 --> 06:29:43,290
We teleport to uh

3648
06:29:43,290 --> 06:29:48,599
Temple quarter again, and then we just got to go north for a while. That was shocking

3649
06:29:49,240 --> 06:29:52,840
I'm shocked that you're at plus 16. I don't know why it's shocking

3650
06:29:53,400 --> 06:30:08,889
I am shocked. I'm shocked to learn how little you listen to me. He said it like 50 times

3651
06:30:09,290 --> 06:30:14,330
I thought you were talking about your glint stone thing was like super powerful somehow because of a

3652
06:30:15,849 --> 06:30:21,049
Some reason asked me why it was so strong and I says because my weapon is plus 16

3653
06:30:21,770 --> 06:30:24,459
And it's a weapon art

3654
06:30:24,459 --> 06:30:26,700
Oh, I you only said that once and I didn't listen to you

3655
06:30:28,110 --> 06:30:30,990
You asked who asked

3656
06:30:32,380 --> 06:30:34,700
Hey, hey who asked am I right guys?

3657
06:30:36,139 --> 06:30:38,139
I asked I care

3658
06:30:38,939 --> 06:30:43,020
A plus one weapon a face movie. No controller plugged in

3659
06:30:47,610 --> 06:30:50,409
That's so fucking stupid. I cannot believe that

3660
06:30:50,970 --> 06:30:54,729
I forgot how this works. Do we go underneath the thing like we just keep going under here

3661
06:30:54,810 --> 06:30:57,319
Or do we have to go up to the left for eg?

3662
06:30:57,720 --> 06:31:03,529
The thing is I was like so indecisive that I wouldn't oh, I don't want to upgrade that because I don't know. I'm not sure

3663
06:31:06,639 --> 06:31:17,950
Up up into the left

3664
06:31:18,349 --> 06:31:23,930
up and to the left a little bit of a bonfire here for any bonfire enjoyers coming up on our

3665
06:31:24,490 --> 06:31:26,650
Left-hand side if you look out the passenger side window

3666
06:31:26,810 --> 06:31:28,650
Well, but to be really fair though

3667
06:31:28,650 --> 06:31:33,849
You did go from like doing nothing to like millions of damage like 30 minutes ago 40 minutes

3668
06:31:33,930 --> 06:31:38,250
Yeah, because I got very excited and I told you I went from plus five to plus 16

3669
06:31:38,490 --> 06:31:41,610
So it's not like this has been going on for the last six and a half hours

3670
06:31:42,009 --> 06:31:48,650
This is just you know, like 30 40 minutes ago you got omega juiced up you got absolutely juiced up this happened

3671
06:31:49,290 --> 06:32:00,169
Like shortly after market before we did the castle it is

3672
06:32:00,990 --> 06:32:05,389
Yeah, because after we beat market there was a whole bunch of smithing stones on the floor for me in the front of the castle

3673
06:32:05,790 --> 06:32:07,790
You got absolutely powered up

3674
06:32:08,110 --> 06:32:10,200
Really? Yeah

3675
06:32:10,200 --> 06:32:11,959
Well, it's not that long

3676
06:32:11,959 --> 06:32:14,680
Yeah, I bet you thought it would take longer for me to surpass you kid

3677
06:32:15,319 --> 06:32:19,000
Just wait till I get this thing to plus 16. Oh all of a sudden you're gonna be freaking out

3678
06:32:19,799 --> 06:32:21,799
Okay, where are we going? Because this bear hurts

3679
06:32:22,810 --> 06:32:24,810
Keep running north

3680
06:32:24,810 --> 06:32:26,990
Have you played?

3681
06:32:26,990 --> 06:32:31,630
You didn't know where you didn't know where we were going until chat told you five seconds ago. I knew

3682
06:32:32,270 --> 06:32:34,270
I figured it out. What?

3683
06:32:34,349 --> 06:32:41,229
It's a chest over there. Hey, remember when you want to see that

3684
06:32:42,110 --> 06:32:43,389
every enemy

3685
06:32:43,389 --> 06:32:45,560
every random ass enemy

3686
06:32:45,639 --> 06:32:51,000
When uh when elven ring was new after my first playthrough and there were some mods I used one that was uh, I don't know

3687
06:32:51,000 --> 06:32:52,830
What's hitting me?

3688
06:32:52,830 --> 06:32:56,909
There was one where the enemy aggro range was basically infinite

3689
06:32:57,630 --> 06:33:02,189
So like you'd spawn into a zone and every single enemy that has loaded in would run at you

3690
06:33:04,159 --> 06:33:05,599
Uh good times

3691
06:33:05,599 --> 06:33:10,619
This is pretty good times

3692
06:33:10,619 --> 06:33:13,979
So where exactly are we going from where you are right now?

3693
06:33:16,939 --> 06:33:19,049
um

3694
06:33:19,049 --> 06:33:20,650
Like from where you are currently right now

3695
06:33:20,650 --> 06:33:25,450
I believe you just hold left and then you go through some ruins and then eg's on the left. Okay

3696
06:33:26,169 --> 06:33:28,169
I feel like I already went kind of far though

3697
06:33:28,409 --> 06:33:30,409
You you did you have gone kind of far

3698
06:33:30,889 --> 06:33:32,889
I don't think I passed it though

3699
06:33:33,470 --> 06:33:36,029
No, yeah, I don't think you've been going that far

3700
06:33:38,439 --> 06:33:41,959
I definitely don't think you've passed it. Yeah. No, it's it's right up here. Yeah

3701
06:33:48,700 --> 06:33:51,069
Oh, you made it

3702
06:33:51,069 --> 06:33:53,759
What are you doing?

3703
06:33:53,759 --> 06:33:55,919
um

3704
06:33:55,919 --> 06:33:59,919
You were running in place like 100 feet in the air on my screen that whole time

3705
06:34:01,340 --> 06:34:06,270
I have no idea where you are. I'm just following the marker. No

3706
06:34:06,830 --> 06:34:08,830
Because the marker was pointing me to you in the air

3707
06:34:12,939 --> 06:34:15,419
Hey, there you are

3708
06:34:15,500 --> 06:34:20,919
You know, they took that sound from vega from uh street fighter. He makes that sound they did it first

3709
06:34:21,159 --> 06:34:22,439
um

3710
06:34:22,439 --> 06:34:24,439
I think something's wrong with my game

3711
06:34:24,909 --> 06:34:26,909
Okay. Well, let's just get to this thing

3712
06:34:27,439 --> 06:34:34,220
It's right up here friend

3713
06:34:34,220 --> 06:34:36,700
Can you hear the sound of my voice friend? I all right

3714
06:34:36,939 --> 06:34:41,020
Can you just tell me north east south or west from where we just continue going north?

3715
06:34:41,259 --> 06:34:48,840
This game sucks. This game sucks. This game sucks. This game sucks. Well, how did you die?

3716
06:34:49,400 --> 06:34:52,959
This game sucks. What did you do? What what did he do my my horse?

3717
06:34:53,040 --> 06:34:56,319
He didn't jump it got like stuck on a rock for a second and it didn't jump

3718
06:35:03,229 --> 06:35:10,220
I can't believe that grr rr martin would fucking do that. Like really man

3719
06:35:11,340 --> 06:35:13,500
Okay. Hi. There you are. I can finally see you now

3720
06:35:16,919 --> 06:35:22,279
Oh, I know where to go now. Okay. Now I I remember now you feel like it's an illusory wall. You have to hit this

3721
06:35:22,360 --> 06:35:23,720
Yeah

3722
06:35:23,720 --> 06:35:25,720
Yeah, if you're lame you hit the wall

3723
06:35:26,119 --> 06:35:31,159
You got my ten souls. Yeah, cool kids do it the other way

3724
06:35:39,209 --> 06:35:40,669
Okay

3725
06:35:40,669 --> 06:35:44,590
So I need to make a decision here and the decision is i'm gonna upgrade a bunch of shit

3726
06:35:50,250 --> 06:35:53,369
He's not here. There he is. He's he's loading in

3727
06:35:58,779 --> 06:36:00,349
Okay

3728
06:36:00,349 --> 06:36:11,549
Hi, what do I want?

3729
06:36:12,009 --> 06:36:14,330
Hey, by the way, just a quick question

3730
06:36:15,290 --> 06:36:16,169
Yeah

3731
06:36:16,169 --> 06:36:19,930
On my game, it is not one smithing stone to upgrade something

3732
06:36:22,330 --> 06:36:25,959
It I need not I need I need four

3733
06:36:26,599 --> 06:36:31,259
To keep going. I think you have the like cool cheat game. I don't

3734
06:36:31,919 --> 06:36:32,720
Oh

3735
06:36:32,720 --> 06:36:38,159
It was it was it's part of the randomizer and my thought because I gave you the overall seed and you copied all my stuff

3736
06:36:38,159 --> 06:36:42,479
That you would also have that but I think that makes sense because you actually don't have my seed

3737
06:36:44,319 --> 06:36:51,400
So so something happened. It's all the way wait somber. I think it's somber not regular

3738
06:36:53,119 --> 06:36:57,580
I think somber is always one like in in the normal game

3739
06:36:57,979 --> 06:37:04,220
Somber can't be plus 16. So everyone was making fun of me and it turns out that I I because I was like

3740
06:37:04,220 --> 06:37:06,380
Yeah, yeah somber weapons go up to plus 10

3741
06:37:07,529 --> 06:37:10,810
Yeah, so when I was doing the upgrades it was like, oh I need four more stones

3742
06:37:10,810 --> 06:37:14,650
I'm sitting here going what is people talking about? I had it right. I'm not the idiot. I

3743
06:37:15,369 --> 06:37:19,520
I'm looking at what I got on my screen. It wasn't my fault

3744
06:37:23,360 --> 06:37:31,290
So give me all your stones then wait, you can't so I need a somber weapon because we'll get

3745
06:37:31,610 --> 06:37:37,000
Your weapon and I can upgrade it. Oh, that's right. We can do that. Uh here do this one

3746
06:37:37,159 --> 06:37:40,619
I want to use this for a little while. I don't have a somber one

3747
06:37:40,700 --> 06:37:45,900
So if you have a plus one, I I can take yours all the way to plus seven

3748
06:37:46,639 --> 06:37:49,069
Okay, hold on I can do

3749
06:37:52,599 --> 06:37:54,599
I can take this to plus three

3750
06:37:55,659 --> 06:37:56,700
four

3751
06:37:56,700 --> 06:38:06,990
Okay, I need you can do it from five to seven, right? Yeah. Okay, wait after

3752
06:38:18,400 --> 06:38:21,200
No, please not the joke weapon. Well, hey take two take

3753
06:38:23,049 --> 06:38:26,889
No, it's fine. It's fine. I'm gonna I'll upgrade this one too. We're doing the finger

3754
06:38:28,060 --> 06:38:36,479
You're gonna do the finger. But yeah, i'm gonna do them both. Okay, he's gonna do the finger

3755
06:38:36,720 --> 06:38:51,529
I'm gonna do with them both. Is everybody really gonna be mad at me about this? I've been doing like

3756
06:38:52,009 --> 06:38:58,330
60 damage for the last two hours. It's gonna be better. I deleted it by accident

3757
06:39:02,439 --> 06:39:05,080
I need that back actually so you need to figure that out

3758
06:39:10,970 --> 06:39:15,849
I don't have the souls to upgrade if you have like runes you can drop. It's like a thousand per upgrade

3759
06:39:16,090 --> 06:39:23,869
Just give it back bro. Just give it back bro. Come on, bro

3760
06:39:24,189 --> 06:39:28,270
Yeah, but this is not like diablo 2. I can't drop rune. I can't drop gold on the ground

3761
06:39:28,590 --> 06:39:39,099
You can drop runes what right you can just discard like a stack of runes where wait, can you actually do that though?

3762
06:39:40,680 --> 06:39:44,240
Pretty sure yes, you can how this is like diablo

3763
06:39:44,400 --> 06:39:48,919
You just discard the runes just like you do with the weapon you have to do with your inventory

3764
06:39:48,919 --> 06:40:00,349
Not your equipment. Oh, just not not discard leave do not discard them. I need 1200 rune to get seven

3765
06:40:03,799 --> 06:40:05,799
Where is this?

3766
06:40:05,799 --> 06:40:15,900
Where is it in the item menu? I don't know this item menu was like gigantic golden runes

3767
06:40:23,470 --> 06:40:30,080
Oh, okay. I okay, I don't think this is gonna get you there. I didn't think you could drop those

3768
06:40:30,240 --> 06:40:33,599
I didn't know I didn't think you could drop those. I thought there's like a bound

3769
06:40:37,759 --> 06:40:44,360
That was 400. I don't think I had enough if we could sell stuff here. I could do it, but I don't think he sells

3770
06:40:45,209 --> 06:40:57,130
Oh, yeah, I can't I can't plus seven then that's look i'm gonna be doing

3771
06:40:57,790 --> 06:41:15,689
Like 500 more damage than I was before. It's fine. We're good. Give it to me. Yeah plus six is pretty big for somber

3772
06:41:15,770 --> 06:41:28,490
It's on the ground. It's not did you delete it? No, it's on the ground. I put it put it right here

3773
06:41:29,689 --> 06:41:34,720
I can still pick it up again. Okay. Hold on. Let me sit down. You can't pick it up because you upgraded it

3774
06:41:35,040 --> 06:41:42,319
What what do you mean now? What hold on? It's too high. What does that mean? He's not plus. What does this mean?

3775
06:41:42,799 --> 06:41:45,279
I got a plus one omen killer still

3776
06:41:46,400 --> 06:41:54,540
Fucked. Oh, okay. You can't drop that for me. We were trying to tell you we were warning you

3777
06:41:54,700 --> 06:42:00,590
You've never had a plus six so you can't just try to play this game with my friend

3778
06:42:01,389 --> 06:42:04,590
Fucking miyazaki

3779
06:42:04,590 --> 06:42:14,009
When can I hold this? Can I I can't do you see the item I dropped on the ground? I can see that. Yes

3780
06:42:15,049 --> 06:42:23,689
Okay, that's a that's a plus two. Okay, I need intelligence first. How much do I need? That's a plus three

3781
06:42:26,400 --> 06:42:35,259
That's a plus four. Yep. Well people were telling us we couldn't drop that shit. Wait, I thought we couldn't why is everybody making things up to us?

3782
06:42:35,419 --> 06:42:37,979
The only reason we did it that way

3783
06:42:38,060 --> 06:42:40,889
Wait, what?

3784
06:42:40,889 --> 06:42:43,200
Okay. All right. All right, and so

3785
06:42:44,090 --> 06:42:48,250
Here's a uh, here's a maybe you can't see that one. Maybe that one's too high

3786
06:42:48,250 --> 06:42:54,169
That one's a plus seven. I got that six, but what do I need to upgrade something else that I can actually use

3787
06:42:54,810 --> 06:43:08,779
I need 16 intelligence. So what is somber in my fucking inventory that I can equip dude?

3788
06:43:08,860 --> 06:43:17,500
We're just we're destroying the economy. Wait finger

3789
06:43:18,060 --> 06:43:20,880
He has the finger and I can't get it back room. All right

3790
06:43:20,880 --> 06:43:27,740
I'm just gonna do like the gargoyle axe or something or the omen cleaver gargoyle axe is good

3791
06:43:27,740 --> 06:43:31,630
Well, either those but it's regular smithing stones gargoyle

3792
06:43:34,240 --> 06:43:50,189
Yeah, can I hold this hold what the gargoyle? Okay, but this is not this is regular smithing stone though

3793
06:43:51,959 --> 06:44:12,040
I need four. I mean, please the sword will work. This i'm not sure that it will upgrade the runes great sword

3794
06:44:12,200 --> 06:44:14,279
Yeah, I know but I need intelligence

3795
06:44:14,279 --> 06:44:19,400
I can't this whole thing got fucked up because you took the fucking finger from me and I can't get it back

3796
06:44:19,880 --> 06:44:22,840
What they're saying is is that if you upgrade that sword

3797
06:44:23,240 --> 06:44:27,639
Then I can drop the finger and you'll be able to see it because you have an item that's upgraded to six

3798
06:44:29,479 --> 06:44:32,360
Okay, all right, so upgrade this stupid sword

3799
06:44:32,840 --> 06:44:37,000
What's what I need runes or or I have a bloodhounds fang

3800
06:44:39,200 --> 06:44:42,639
Or rivers of blood that I can give you or that you can do it to the moon veil

3801
06:44:43,130 --> 06:44:48,569
Because I might actually upgrade that anyway. All right, but I I have I I have I need like 15 000 souls

3802
06:44:49,880 --> 06:44:55,560
Okay, that should be enough I I need like 15 000 souls to upgrade this to plus seven

3803
06:44:56,240 --> 06:45:03,759
Oh, it's way too much. And what would you like to go do? I'm freaking out dude, dude

3804
06:45:04,080 --> 06:45:09,069
I I don't know. I don't have a weapon anymore. I think you only need like

3805
06:45:10,009 --> 06:45:15,159
6000 where you just go sell some shit. I don't know. I'm selling literally everything I fucking have

3806
06:45:15,319 --> 06:45:20,880
I thought I thought I just almost killed him. We just run up into that castle and kill lice. All right

3807
06:45:20,959 --> 06:45:35,630
Go that boss go fight this come on keep playing and save up everything. We're fine

3808
06:45:36,540 --> 06:45:39,529
Blame blame the

3809
06:45:39,529 --> 06:45:49,340
The fact that we didn't know that how how are we supposed to know that was going to happen because of the the strict

3810
06:45:49,819 --> 06:45:55,340
Online integrity of the elden ring game where you definitely can't just download a soul level

3811
06:45:55,560 --> 06:45:58,729
200 character and then play online

3812
06:45:59,770 --> 06:46:07,020
We can't drop shit. We didn't know we could probably kill this boss

3813
06:46:07,259 --> 06:46:17,419
I think we can easily demolish this boss and make it look like children. We're supposed to play this game

3814
06:46:19,340 --> 06:46:27,759
I actually don't do terrible damage with this. This area is also

3815
06:46:28,319 --> 06:46:38,159
I it might be lower level. I can't remember. Jesus. Oh carrion regal scepter

3816
06:46:38,240 --> 06:46:43,209
Oh, I thought that was a sword but also a captain staff this guy like extra big

3817
06:46:43,450 --> 06:46:49,659
I feel like they're not normally this big. Oh, you didn't find the secret extra egg boss egg bubble boss

3818
06:46:49,740 --> 06:46:56,060
You didn't find the bubble butt boss. Oh, looks like you don't know that his bubble butt can fucking crush your fucking jaw

3819
06:46:56,700 --> 06:46:58,700
Dude, i'm so fucked up right now

3820
06:46:58,700 --> 06:47:01,900
I'm just like, oh, there's so many emotions doing too much stimulation

3821
06:47:03,979 --> 06:47:50,189
There's way too much stimulation right now. First of all, get this off. So lance. All right. What do you think this? Oh my god

3822
06:47:56,270 --> 06:48:18,540
Nice damage, dude. Maybe you should upgrade your weapon. Oh my goodness

3823
06:48:21,840 --> 06:48:33,790
Oh, that was actually pretty cool. I didn't know that that was cool. All right getting there spam jump. It's heavy swings

3824
06:48:34,650 --> 06:48:38,409
What uh guys, uh, what do you want me to do? I need to get I I get it by any means necessary

3825
06:48:39,369 --> 06:48:42,970
Don't let them get to you they're they're see they're making fun of you for using something

3826
06:48:42,970 --> 06:48:45,450
That's actually good in the game to dissuade you from doing it

3827
06:48:46,009 --> 06:48:51,369
So that they can make fun of you when you do something also less efficient. It's gonna just keep happening

3828
06:48:53,450 --> 06:48:55,130
They're in your head, man

3829
06:48:55,130 --> 06:49:02,680
Sir, I haven't been live this whole time. I don't even know what you're talking about

3830
06:49:04,279 --> 06:49:08,599
Then who have you been talking to who's he talking to? I just i'm just having fun with my friend

3831
06:49:09,240 --> 06:49:11,919
I told you I didn't feel that good and I wasn't streaming today

3832
06:49:16,779 --> 06:49:20,700
That makes me feel worse that you weren't listening to me earlier because I know that's so much worse

3833
06:49:20,939 --> 06:49:22,939
That is like a thousand times worse

3834
06:49:23,099 --> 06:49:30,540
Now, this is what his full attention is where you're going. You're doing role play. You're doing like some some clergy

3835
06:49:33,119 --> 06:49:35,439
Everyone part of it. No, just pick the item that's here

3836
06:49:37,450 --> 06:49:45,580
Oh, wow lightning great bolts

3837
06:49:45,580 --> 06:49:47,580
Oh, wow, like hear ye hear ye

3838
06:49:51,319 --> 06:49:55,639
That but the joke was that i'm not doing a bit. I just wanted you to get the item

3839
06:50:05,630 --> 06:50:08,639
You'll get them you don't belong here now

3840
06:50:09,279 --> 06:50:18,330
Let's just run through all this

3841
06:50:18,330 --> 06:50:19,610
Yeah

3842
06:50:19,610 --> 06:50:22,729
I'm surprised. These are all actually ghost mode. I know it's weird

3843
06:50:35,209 --> 06:50:39,840
What what happened this fucking goblin goon?

3844
06:50:40,639 --> 06:50:45,880
One shot me

3845
06:50:45,880 --> 06:50:47,880
Just some regular dude

3846
06:50:49,049 --> 06:50:51,049
Oh, I think I have uh, I might have um

3847
06:50:51,770 --> 06:50:53,770
Here i'm resetting it. Hello

3848
06:50:53,770 --> 06:50:58,279
I might have had a

3849
06:50:58,279 --> 06:51:00,439
What uh that I might have the debuffs

3850
06:51:03,020 --> 06:51:05,020
Oh my god

3851
06:51:05,259 --> 06:51:07,259
Oh, and you had i'm just running to you

3852
06:51:08,220 --> 06:51:10,779
um

3853
06:51:10,779 --> 06:51:16,139
You just spawned everybody on me too. Yeah, that's fine because you're really powerful and you're capable

3854
06:51:27,639 --> 06:51:29,639
Like I just launched a nuke

3855
06:51:33,159 --> 06:51:35,159
The way we're even supposed to be going

3856
06:51:35,880 --> 06:51:38,060
I think we've dropped down. Don't we?

3857
06:51:38,060 --> 06:51:45,099
Do we just do we go drop down somewhere?

3858
06:51:46,000 --> 06:51:48,720
I don't remember. I thought you like you come out this way

3859
06:51:48,720 --> 06:51:52,000
Then it summons things then you go back and it opens up a different area or

3860
06:51:52,880 --> 06:51:58,720
I don't know. It's been a long. It's been like a year. I don't I think we actually oh, oh, but wait, wait, wait

3861
06:51:59,919 --> 06:52:04,360
Over here

3862
06:52:04,360 --> 06:52:07,959
I think that's different. That's where you get the like the super omega laser beam sword

3863
06:52:08,599 --> 06:52:13,400
I wonder what's here then. Oh my god. What a completely missed. What a jump

3864
06:52:13,799 --> 06:52:17,959
I didn't even jump forward. I did like the tiniest smallest hop i've ever seen

3865
06:52:18,599 --> 06:52:20,599
Yeah, that was a complete whiff

3866
06:52:20,840 --> 06:52:34,029
I think over here. No, I just want to go up to uh

3867
06:52:35,630 --> 06:52:38,439
Lycia what was that dude?

3868
06:52:39,400 --> 06:52:41,400
Oh my god. Okay. This is

3869
06:52:43,680 --> 06:52:45,680
There's a dragon over here a big one

3870
06:52:48,759 --> 06:52:53,689
Not a small dragon

3871
06:52:53,689 --> 06:52:56,490
Yeah, we just went the wrong way. There's a different path up here

3872
06:52:57,209 --> 06:53:01,959
This is where the sword of uh knight and flame is right? Yeah

3873
06:53:07,290 --> 06:53:09,290
You might need to go back to the bonfire

3874
06:53:09,770 --> 06:53:13,610
um, okay

3875
06:53:13,689 --> 06:53:19,369
Are you did you spawn or are you not spawned? I I ran up to where we should have ran already

3876
06:53:22,360 --> 06:53:23,560
Uh

3877
06:53:23,560 --> 06:53:31,279
I think i'm going the right way, aren't I? I think this is the right way. Wait, isn't this I think i'm going the right way

3878
06:53:31,520 --> 06:53:35,680
You're going the right way. I think i'm going the right way. No, this is i'm going the right. No, you're going the wrong way

3879
06:53:35,680 --> 06:53:37,680
No, i'm going the right way

3880
06:53:38,009 --> 06:53:40,569
I'm 100 going the right way. You're going the wrong way

3881
06:53:41,369 --> 06:53:42,889
You're on the wrong way

3882
06:53:42,889 --> 06:53:44,889
I'm in a bonfire right now. Where are you?

3883
06:53:45,049 --> 06:53:48,970
Like a new bonfire you haven't been to but I don't think that I can warp you here because you haven't been here

3884
06:53:51,020 --> 06:53:52,619
Am I not going the right way?

3885
06:53:52,619 --> 06:53:56,560
You're not going the right way. We don't wait because you come up this way and then

3886
06:53:57,439 --> 06:54:08,590
Because we were in here

3887
06:54:08,590 --> 06:54:10,590
And then out here

3888
06:54:15,439 --> 06:54:19,150
Okay, I was going the right way

3889
06:54:24,830 --> 06:54:26,430
Yeah, then over here

3890
06:54:26,430 --> 06:54:29,709
I mean I have

3891
06:54:29,709 --> 06:54:31,869
I was no idea where you are. I was going the right way

3892
06:54:36,430 --> 06:54:38,110
I don't think

3893
06:54:38,110 --> 06:54:42,680
That's true

3894
06:54:42,680 --> 06:54:45,000
Yes, I know. I'm I I promise you i'm going the right way

3895
06:54:45,479 --> 06:54:51,209
Do I have to like look at your stream to see what the oh you aren't you are going the right way and

3896
06:54:52,409 --> 06:54:55,049
I i've been telling you I was going the right way

3897
06:54:55,930 --> 06:54:59,400
It took a long way to get to the right way

3898
06:55:00,279 --> 06:55:13,180
It may have been the long way, but it was a correct way. Is there another bonfire up here? Yeah

3899
06:55:13,819 --> 06:55:21,020
That that fucking bowl's wearing your head down dude. It actually is I need to take it off

3900
06:55:21,500 --> 06:55:44,169
This is how my mom and dad argue on road trips guy showing off with his mom and dad

3901
06:55:51,500 --> 06:55:56,490
Cool, I got I got miniature ronnie and the finger slayer blade

3902
06:55:57,630 --> 06:56:00,560
Really isn't that aren't those both the same quest?

3903
06:56:02,159 --> 06:56:03,520
I think they are

3904
06:56:03,520 --> 06:56:11,840
This weapon is so dumb. It's just like that

3905
06:56:12,319 --> 06:56:19,020
It's like just a wall. It's like a piece of a wall. It's like the chair of a it's a leg of a chair

3906
06:56:21,020 --> 06:56:23,819
This is an expensive chair, which is a big big hand

3907
06:56:29,680 --> 06:56:31,680
Nice swing loser

3908
06:56:39,290 --> 06:56:42,250
Big hand is a big hand is here big hand

3909
06:56:42,970 --> 06:56:46,569
There's an archer big hand is more important than archer, isn't it?

3910
06:56:46,650 --> 06:56:48,889
What if the archer hits you and the big hand's coming for you?

3911
06:56:48,970 --> 06:56:51,849
Big hand is more dangerous than the archer archer. You can easily dodge

3912
06:56:54,159 --> 06:56:58,560
But the archer hits you and stuns you and then you get hit by the big hand. Yeah. Well if you get hit

3913
06:57:00,599 --> 06:57:02,599
Big bear don't go left

3914
06:57:03,000 --> 06:57:04,680
Which way?

3915
06:57:04,680 --> 06:57:06,680
This is a mobile game ad

3916
06:57:07,150 --> 06:57:11,630
Which way do you pick? Oh, I don't know. Maybe i'll go this way. They always pick the shittiest way

3917
06:57:12,189 --> 06:57:22,619
Yeah, oh I got sword dance

3918
06:57:23,099 --> 06:57:23,979
dance

3919
06:57:23,979 --> 06:57:29,470
I've heard what this was

3920
06:57:29,470 --> 06:57:35,259
But okay. No, I know. I think I know but I don't know that's up and the boss is literally right here

3921
06:57:35,419 --> 06:57:37,740
Yeah, I know but I thought there was like a shortcut you open there

3922
06:57:38,299 --> 06:57:41,639
Okay, you ready to fight mad soldier? I'm ready to fight. Uh

3923
06:57:42,340 --> 06:57:44,340
magma worm three

3924
06:57:49,229 --> 06:57:51,529
Get up

3925
06:57:52,009 --> 06:57:54,009
My game is lagging so bad

3926
06:57:58,159 --> 06:58:00,319
Oh my god, she's raining people on us

3927
06:58:03,689 --> 06:58:04,810
um

3928
06:58:04,810 --> 06:58:06,810
When do we get to fight her?

3929
06:58:12,119 --> 06:58:14,279
They're beating me by making me run out of stamina

3930
06:58:15,099 --> 06:58:18,139
all right, this actually we gotta be don't be so cocky here because

3931
06:58:19,020 --> 06:58:21,020
They're just dive bombing

3932
06:58:21,020 --> 06:58:24,110
ow

3933
06:58:24,110 --> 06:58:26,110
Hey, you gotta dodge that

3934
06:58:26,880 --> 06:58:28,880
Oh because we have to kill the ones with the

3935
06:58:29,040 --> 06:58:30,159
the oro

3936
06:58:30,159 --> 06:58:34,990
I'm sorry my bloodlust

3937
06:58:34,990 --> 06:58:40,360
Sorry

3938
06:58:40,360 --> 06:58:45,959
I love the dive the design of this fight. This is amazing. This should have been the real fight. This should have been the actual fight

3939
06:58:52,990 --> 06:58:54,990
Watch out for the explosive

3940
06:58:56,939 --> 06:58:58,939
Watch out explosives inbound

3941
06:59:04,919 --> 06:59:11,040
Be it right now. Here's where this gets really wacky. There's not a part two to this, right?

3942
06:59:11,759 --> 06:59:14,970
I have no idea

3943
06:59:14,970 --> 06:59:18,729
I hope not

3944
06:59:18,729 --> 06:59:20,729
Okay, when does she land?

3945
06:59:26,490 --> 06:59:29,790
No, stop it. Stop it anakin. You're killing younglings

3946
06:59:35,759 --> 06:59:39,040
What's going on? I don't know. I was like waiting to see if like

3947
06:59:40,479 --> 06:59:42,479
She's not spawning the ones we need to kill

3948
06:59:42,720 --> 06:59:44,959
I I think oh no, she broke right?

3949
06:59:45,680 --> 06:59:49,930
Yeah, she broke

3950
06:59:49,930 --> 07:00:00,009
There's so much shit in the way

3951
07:00:00,009 --> 07:00:04,970
Oh my goodness. I hope I hope I don't die here. There's no way I die this there's no way I die

3952
07:00:07,529 --> 07:00:12,840
It would be so shameful this book won't stop hitting me

3953
07:00:15,689 --> 07:00:17,689
What a shameful boss

3954
07:00:18,009 --> 07:00:53,200
I think her strategy is just trying to make you feel bad. I think the one we have to kill is up there

3955
07:00:53,279 --> 07:00:54,880
No, all right. We're good

3956
07:00:54,880 --> 07:00:56,880
Pray for no face too. Seriously

3957
07:01:00,360 --> 07:01:03,229
Thank god, yeah

3958
07:01:03,229 --> 07:01:06,270
Got talisman pouch. I have I have like four talismans

3959
07:01:06,990 --> 07:01:08,990
Pouches, but only one talisman

3960
07:01:11,200 --> 07:01:13,259
Yeah, we need more pouches

3961
07:01:13,259 --> 07:01:17,740
No the other way I saw the other way the other way that I like I only how many do you have?

3962
07:01:18,299 --> 07:01:21,799
How many do you have stop dude, please stop?

3963
07:01:22,360 --> 07:01:24,349
This is not good

3964
07:01:24,349 --> 07:01:33,240
I don't know if there's an item back here

3965
07:01:33,240 --> 07:01:37,209
Nope, do you want to go visit pidea? Do you like pidea?

3966
07:01:41,580 --> 07:01:44,080
Um

3967
07:01:44,080 --> 07:01:48,799
What okay, so

3968
07:01:50,080 --> 07:01:56,090
Next step

3969
07:01:56,090 --> 07:01:57,290
Um, I promise next up

3970
07:01:57,290 --> 07:01:57,450
Yeah

3971
07:01:57,450 --> 07:02:01,770
I think we go back down that uh that other way and we drop down and then you go into the church again

3972
07:02:01,770 --> 07:02:08,880
And you talk to pidea and use a merchant. Uh, I need to upgrade this weapon. I need to actually go do that

3973
07:02:09,439 --> 07:02:13,099
Do you have enough souls? You should have enough. So I I definitely do at this point. Yeah

3974
07:02:14,779 --> 07:02:18,279
So we need to go back making me stand up. I don't know. I just want to level

3975
07:02:20,599 --> 07:02:24,919
Like forcing me to stand up. It's weird come this way. I need to I want to level this up. No come this way

3976
07:02:24,919 --> 07:02:32,380
We're already here. It's like two seconds. Okay. All right. All right. I'm here two seconds

3977
07:02:32,619 --> 07:02:47,419
I forgot to blink. You haven't blinked in the last hour. It feels like it. Can you do that with your souls?

3978
07:02:47,979 --> 07:03:01,159
Oh, that's where all the pots are

3979
07:03:01,159 --> 07:03:05,880
Wow

3980
07:03:05,880 --> 07:03:07,880
And not pots this time though

3981
07:03:08,439 --> 07:03:19,770
Oh my god

3982
07:03:19,770 --> 07:03:21,369
Gloves ready up. Nice

3983
07:03:21,369 --> 07:03:43,069
sleep tight

3984
07:03:43,389 --> 07:03:44,669
baby

3985
07:03:44,669 --> 07:03:47,259
What the fuck?

3986
07:03:47,259 --> 07:03:49,259
sleep tight

3987
07:03:49,500 --> 07:04:07,069
I'm somewhat lost and confused. I thought this was something very different. We we keep going down and then you end up jumping to that thing

3988
07:04:07,869 --> 07:04:18,319
Okay, yeah, would he get away from me? I'm so I don't want to jump with these

3989
07:04:18,959 --> 07:04:21,180
He's gonna attack me

3990
07:04:21,180 --> 07:04:36,729
And keep going. Oh my god. It's the he turned into the boy

3991
07:04:38,169 --> 07:04:41,369
I didn't know I didn't care about that one. I didn't give it a voice. Oh shit. I'm getting out of here

3992
07:04:41,849 --> 07:04:51,680
Is that the meme?

3993
07:04:51,680 --> 07:04:53,520
Has he turned into a titan?

3994
07:04:53,520 --> 07:04:56,439
Is that what I would say if I were like funny?

3995
07:04:57,080 --> 07:05:00,779
What would someone funny say? You need to apologize for that

3996
07:05:02,220 --> 07:05:04,220
No, you need to apologize because that's

3997
07:05:04,860 --> 07:05:09,340
I didn't know he could do that

3998
07:05:09,340 --> 07:05:11,340
We came all the way this way for like one item

3999
07:05:12,970 --> 07:05:14,409
What is that usually?

4000
07:05:14,409 --> 07:05:16,779
I think that is

4001
07:05:16,840 --> 07:05:18,840
Usually it is um

4002
07:05:19,500 --> 07:05:23,020
Okay, i'm i'm i'm gonna die if I go down there so i'm not going to

4003
07:05:23,580 --> 07:05:27,340
Okay, let's um, let's I can't teleport because this fucking titan over here

4004
07:05:28,139 --> 07:05:32,939
Won't stop. Yeah. Well, there's like a chimera fighting me now like we really shouldn't have done that

4005
07:05:33,099 --> 07:05:35,099
I don't know why if all I do should have just left

4006
07:05:35,580 --> 07:05:43,959
I really was hoping we could like go to different areas

4007
07:05:44,840 --> 07:05:47,159
I think we can I think you can just go somewhere else

4008
07:05:48,119 --> 07:05:51,799
I mean whenever we waypoint travel here i'm resetting so we can travel. Yeah

4009
07:05:52,439 --> 07:05:59,549
Where do you want to go? Oh you wanted to go upgrade. Yes, I do

4010
07:06:00,400 --> 07:06:03,259
That would be nice

4011
07:06:03,259 --> 07:06:06,060
Leave aaron in 2021. We need a new meme funeral

4012
07:06:07,400 --> 07:06:09,080
Oh, I forgot about that

4013
07:06:09,080 --> 07:06:12,759
They haven't even finished that show yet. How can the meme be dead before the show is over?

4014
07:06:13,000 --> 07:06:16,459
The problem with the show is they keep doing

4015
07:06:17,049 --> 07:06:18,590
final season

4016
07:06:18,590 --> 07:06:20,830
attack on titan last season part two

4017
07:06:21,549 --> 07:06:23,470
final season

4018
07:06:23,470 --> 07:06:27,080
part three aaron's final moments part one

4019
07:06:32,799 --> 07:06:37,360
All right. I i'm picking this thing. I'm doing this. We're gonna upgrade this thing all the way

4020
07:06:40,349 --> 07:06:43,950
Okay, I need 30. I need one smithing stone five. Do you have one?

4021
07:06:49,709 --> 07:06:57,869
No, I have a four and a seven i'm the weird one i want to make sure everyone knows that

4022
07:07:00,090 --> 07:07:03,130
We've got a four and then a seven and then like an ancient

4023
07:07:03,689 --> 07:07:04,970
dragon one

4024
07:07:04,970 --> 07:07:07,630
That's good enough

4025
07:07:07,630 --> 07:07:11,150
Okay, what what is yours upgraded to can I like drop your finger on the ground for you?

4026
07:07:11,470 --> 07:07:14,110
This is plus five at this point plus four

4027
07:07:14,669 --> 07:07:21,790
You're just making up numbers

4028
07:07:21,790 --> 07:07:24,909
Okay, you want to go back to ray of lucaria with like a wait. We did that right?

4029
07:07:24,990 --> 07:07:28,349
No, we didn't the way to do syrax that's gonna be interesting

4030
07:07:28,830 --> 07:07:38,520
But yes, okay. What do I need to upgrade one more time? I gotta have hold on

4031
07:07:42,590 --> 07:07:44,590
Should I just put points into intelligence or no?

4032
07:07:45,069 --> 07:08:07,720
Level in yeah, I can respect in a minute. Okay, let's go. We need to go to

4033
07:08:09,240 --> 07:08:11,840
Which one is it?

4034
07:08:11,840 --> 07:08:13,279
it is

4035
07:08:13,279 --> 07:08:20,000
Without the map. It's kind of hard to see. All right. Where we going church of the cuckoo or what is uh debate parlor?

4036
07:08:20,240 --> 07:08:26,990
It's worth it for the sword

4037
07:08:26,990 --> 07:08:34,599
Yeah, i'll be able to do a full respect after this. This is perfect. No amount of intelligence will fix your brain

4038
07:08:34,759 --> 07:08:42,169
Actually, I think a lot of intelligence would fix my brain because i'd be smarter stir

4039
07:08:42,169 --> 07:08:47,130
Can we get a la la, please? A lot of people are asking for it a la la. Yes a la la

4040
07:08:48,000 --> 07:08:59,610
Like the guy from uh better call sol. Yes. I don't think I can do that

4041
07:09:01,290 --> 07:09:05,610
I feel like you probably could was it la la or la lo? I think it was la la. I'm dude, dude

4042
07:09:06,169 --> 07:09:10,830
You don't think you could do it. I don't know what you're asking for to do an impression

4043
07:09:12,159 --> 07:09:15,520
Is that what is that what you were actually asking for because I feel like I went way off

4044
07:09:15,759 --> 07:09:18,560
No, I was asking for you to do an impression of love la la

4045
07:09:20,060 --> 07:09:30,669
Can you give an example? Yes, like hold on. I just don't want to get hit

4046
07:09:41,919 --> 07:09:44,400
Just say la la

4047
07:09:44,400 --> 07:09:46,599
No, that's no I

4048
07:09:46,599 --> 07:09:48,040
la la

4049
07:09:48,040 --> 07:09:49,000
I don't know

4050
07:09:49,000 --> 07:09:51,279
What am I a part of right now?

4051
07:09:51,279 --> 07:09:53,709
Never mind

4052
07:09:53,709 --> 07:09:55,709
Why is it never mind now?

4053
07:09:56,270 --> 07:10:13,500
I've I was busy doing something. There's a secret down there. It's not from

4054
07:10:14,459 --> 07:10:16,459
Breaking bad

4055
07:10:20,060 --> 07:10:22,540
Okay, I thought you guys were linking I was asking you for lines

4056
07:10:23,580 --> 07:10:25,580
That this character says

4057
07:10:25,580 --> 07:10:27,580
I can't remember

4058
07:10:27,580 --> 07:10:35,389
Can you just tell a joke already la la

4059
07:10:37,259 --> 07:10:39,209
there

4060
07:10:39,209 --> 07:10:41,500
Okay, and what is that?

4061
07:10:41,500 --> 07:10:43,740
I don't really even know dude like

4062
07:11:09,709 --> 07:11:11,869
there comes

4063
07:11:11,869 --> 07:11:14,270
Block it tank it block block it tanking

4064
07:11:27,639 --> 07:11:29,880
You can't even see where his body is

4065
07:11:31,159 --> 07:11:34,680
And he can't it seems like he can't see us either because he doesn't really actually attack you

4066
07:11:35,240 --> 07:11:37,819
No, not really

4067
07:11:37,819 --> 07:11:39,020
dude

4068
07:11:39,020 --> 07:11:46,319
What the fuck

4069
07:11:46,319 --> 07:11:49,119
I can't believe placidusex is the queen of the full moon

4070
07:11:52,090 --> 07:11:54,090
I still have not got an estus upgrade

4071
07:11:55,659 --> 07:11:59,819
Okay, I sure hope he's aggro'd to you because i'm just rolling

4072
07:12:00,619 --> 07:12:02,619
at random intervals

4073
07:12:05,040 --> 07:12:06,880
I think he's on you

4074
07:12:06,880 --> 07:12:08,159
He is

4075
07:12:08,159 --> 07:12:11,549
He does not like you

4076
07:12:12,029 --> 07:12:14,029
He just wants to kill you so bad

4077
07:12:14,509 --> 07:12:23,580
I have no more healing

4078
07:12:23,580 --> 07:12:25,580
This is fucking terrible

4079
07:12:28,959 --> 07:12:30,959
There's nothing I could do there

4080
07:12:31,279 --> 07:12:34,159
I didn't even realize he was I I don't know you're you're naked

4081
07:12:37,919 --> 07:12:51,150
ow

4082
07:12:51,150 --> 07:12:53,150
Dude, his ass is so big. I

4083
07:12:53,630 --> 07:13:04,759
Okay. Well, at least you didn't have to do with the infinite flicker strike teleportation. I'm inside the wall

4084
07:13:05,380 --> 07:13:06,680
ability

4085
07:13:06,680 --> 07:13:09,610
There's no way I beat this

4086
07:13:09,610 --> 07:13:10,729
Here we go

4087
07:13:10,729 --> 07:13:11,849
dodge it

4088
07:13:11,849 --> 07:13:14,729
I just did

4089
07:13:14,729 --> 07:13:19,130
I don't know that you dodged it or that he spawned in a situation where he couldn't swing at you

4090
07:13:19,130 --> 07:13:21,130
I just dodged it right there

4091
07:13:21,130 --> 07:13:24,139
Just dodged it right there again

4092
07:13:24,139 --> 07:13:28,159
Yeah, I don't know about that

4093
07:13:30,479 --> 07:13:37,069
I think this he has a second phase

4094
07:13:37,770 --> 07:13:40,490
Just like rinala. I don't think the random enemies

4095
07:13:41,290 --> 07:13:43,290
properly trigger second phases

4096
07:13:44,909 --> 07:13:46,349
Where is he?

4097
07:13:46,349 --> 07:13:48,680
He's coming

4098
07:13:48,680 --> 07:13:51,979
Or not. I think he's stuck in the wall

4099
07:14:01,659 --> 07:14:04,860
Die come on die die die die die. He fell out of the world. Come on die

4100
07:14:06,669 --> 07:14:08,669
He literally fell all the way down

4101
07:14:09,310 --> 07:14:15,369
Come on really

4102
07:14:15,369 --> 07:14:18,009
Yo, I can't imagine fighting like radon in this room

4103
07:14:18,569 --> 07:14:22,299
No

4104
07:14:22,299 --> 07:14:24,860
Like what if he actually got to do his meteor?

4105
07:14:25,659 --> 07:14:29,130
Where would you go?

4106
07:14:29,130 --> 07:14:39,979
dead

4107
07:14:39,979 --> 07:14:41,979
Use your magical potion

4108
07:15:02,590 --> 07:15:06,599
So what's the plan you want to go for it again? Um, I think if I can

4109
07:15:07,639 --> 07:15:10,680
Survive the teleportation phase it could be better

4110
07:15:12,439 --> 07:15:14,439
Can you drop golden seeds?

4111
07:15:15,720 --> 07:15:17,720
because if you can can I just

4112
07:15:18,119 --> 07:15:19,319
I had you

4113
07:15:19,319 --> 07:15:20,759
No, you can't

4114
07:15:20,759 --> 07:15:22,509
Wait, can you?

4115
07:15:22,509 --> 07:15:24,509
Hmm. I think I can

4116
07:15:24,990 --> 07:15:28,880
No, I need the what is the flask upgrade one?

4117
07:15:29,680 --> 07:15:31,200
sacred tear like

4118
07:15:31,200 --> 07:15:32,560
That's what I need

4119
07:15:32,560 --> 07:15:34,560
Yeah, I only have one of those

4120
07:15:34,560 --> 07:15:38,000
It's actually really bad when you need to drink twice to feel your health. Yeah, it's yeah

4121
07:15:38,000 --> 07:15:40,000
I'm drinking like three or four times right now

4122
07:15:58,840 --> 07:16:00,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute

4123
07:16:15,560 --> 07:16:17,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

4124
07:16:18,889 --> 07:16:20,880
Take 10 of these

4125
07:16:20,880 --> 07:16:28,490
Put it on your bar

4126
07:16:28,490 --> 07:16:33,680
Okay, that negates like a ton of damage like almost all physical damage or something

4127
07:16:34,319 --> 07:16:37,040
How do how long they last? I don't know but you have 10 of them

4128
07:16:38,959 --> 07:16:45,630
And if we need more I know where they are. It only blocks physical damage, but that's a big deal

4129
07:16:59,080 --> 07:17:01,080
All right. So before we go in the store

4130
07:17:01,159 --> 07:17:03,159
Fucking snap into a slim gym, right?

4131
07:17:30,540 --> 07:17:32,139
Oh my god

4132
07:17:32,139 --> 07:18:08,720
I what I rolled

4133
07:18:08,720 --> 07:18:13,049
Here it is again. Really? That's unfair. Can you jump over this?

4134
07:18:13,529 --> 07:18:33,080
I doubt it. Nope. He's cheesing us this time. We're actually not in a terrible position

4135
07:18:33,639 --> 07:18:43,150
Okay, i'm eating another

4136
07:18:43,150 --> 07:18:45,310
Where is he? All right. He's in this chandelier

4137
07:18:45,950 --> 07:18:49,150
The chandelier he's a bookcase now

4138
07:18:49,310 --> 07:18:55,500
Oh shit

4139
07:18:55,500 --> 07:19:01,099
No, not no, dude. Come on. What was that? That was horseshit. That actually was stupid

4140
07:19:14,400 --> 07:19:16,400
That same that yeah

4141
07:19:16,479 --> 07:19:20,720
You're not in a bad spot. You're all right. You know, do you still?

4142
07:19:21,680 --> 07:19:23,680
I have no more healing

4143
07:19:26,889 --> 07:19:32,139
Better than last time

4144
07:19:32,139 --> 07:19:36,990
You can hear him

4145
07:19:39,150 --> 07:19:42,110
That's what yeah, it happened to me last time I thought he died that would have been awesome

4146
07:19:45,520 --> 07:19:47,520
Hey, it's still winnable. Yeah, it's true

4147
07:19:47,840 --> 07:20:10,319
I don't know what he's doing. Uh, no you're dead

4148
07:20:13,819 --> 07:20:16,279
No, you're all right

4149
07:20:16,279 --> 07:20:18,119
I thought he was doing the thing in the ground

4150
07:20:18,119 --> 07:20:22,040
Yeah, I was trying to like look up to see what movie was even doing. I think I waste a lot of time doing it

4151
07:20:25,529 --> 07:20:32,040
I think we can do it. Yeah, I think you got like you shouldn't have died that early

4152
07:20:32,119 --> 07:20:32,919
Yeah, sorry there bud

4153
07:20:32,919 --> 07:20:38,040
But like like I think you shouldn't have died there if you watch the vaude he I got hit by a swipe

4154
07:20:38,200 --> 07:20:44,040
And then he started doing the breath immediately directly pinpointing my exact location that I was standing right there and hit me directly

4155
07:20:44,119 --> 07:20:50,860
Right before I even iframes to kick down. Yeah, but like I feel like I feel like you shouldn't have died there

4156
07:20:51,180 --> 07:20:58,970
I really you shouldn't have died there either. You still did. Yeah. Well, I feel like you should have been there to help

4157
07:20:59,740 --> 07:21:01,099
I was died

4158
07:21:01,099 --> 07:21:05,709
Dermott's a good point. Hey

4159
07:21:05,950 --> 07:21:24,799
Hey, I got a feeling this is the one I had that feeling too

4160
07:21:24,880 --> 07:21:27,279
but I don't know we've been married for a while now and

4161
07:21:29,439 --> 07:21:30,720
We can um

4162
07:21:30,720 --> 07:21:40,490
I'm trying to think is it where's the ball? I'm at the elevator

4163
07:21:43,049 --> 07:22:02,490
weird

4164
07:22:02,490 --> 07:22:04,490
All right. Let's focus on surviving

4165
07:22:05,049 --> 07:22:06,810
and focus on

4166
07:22:06,810 --> 07:22:08,810
thriving being

4167
07:22:09,259 --> 07:22:13,500
Good. All right. Okay surviving and being good is our strat

4168
07:22:14,970 --> 07:22:18,990
Eat your thing. Hey, don't forget who got those by the way

4169
07:22:19,549 --> 07:22:22,599
I'm not completely useless

4170
07:22:22,599 --> 07:22:25,479
The trade merchant. All right, no more fucking around. Let's go

4171
07:22:26,200 --> 07:22:27,639
This is the real one

4172
07:22:27,639 --> 07:22:42,759
Stop fucking around. I didn't even see where he swung dude

4173
07:22:43,580 --> 07:23:00,639
There's no way to see it

4174
07:23:00,639 --> 07:23:10,619
That's unfortunate. We're good. He's doing it again. He is

4175
07:23:11,340 --> 07:23:24,520
Who knows what he's doing?

4176
07:23:24,680 --> 07:23:26,680
Can't see his body

4177
07:23:36,400 --> 07:23:40,159
What was I supposed to do there was nothing I could do there

4178
07:23:40,959 --> 07:23:51,580
I've got four flasks this time

4179
07:24:02,080 --> 07:24:05,450
What i'll be honest, I don't even know what hit you

4180
07:24:06,840 --> 07:24:09,479
Like the attack was over and I did like so much damage

4181
07:24:10,569 --> 07:24:12,729
He's just he just fills the whole arena

4182
07:24:16,569 --> 07:24:18,330
I mean to be fair

4183
07:24:18,330 --> 07:24:20,970
This is one of the last bosses of elden ring

4184
07:24:22,270 --> 07:24:23,639
so

4185
07:24:23,639 --> 07:24:25,639
Is there anywhere else we can go?

4186
07:24:25,639 --> 07:24:27,639
There's tons of places we can go

4187
07:24:45,119 --> 07:24:53,630
Is just he just fills the whole arena with that yellow shit. Honestly, you could do this. I think we could

4188
07:24:54,430 --> 07:24:58,909
Just the problem is just that yellow flame if you're in the wrong spot you're dead

4189
07:24:59,709 --> 07:25:04,240
I think i'm just gonna let him kill me here and we give it one more try one more college try

4190
07:25:05,340 --> 07:25:08,060
It's hard to know what is the wrong spot too because he's so big

4191
07:25:20,200 --> 07:25:22,680
I think with your like it if you were just here

4192
07:25:24,060 --> 07:25:30,779
The extra amount of dps he'd be dead. Yeah, I i'm telling you I got I got completely screwed over twice in a row

4193
07:25:31,419 --> 07:25:36,919
Let's go. Let's fucking get this boy

4194
07:25:37,319 --> 07:25:39,819
We can do it. Okay

4195
07:25:40,220 --> 07:25:43,150
So

4196
07:25:45,290 --> 07:25:56,970
It is winnable it's very winnable what if you were good at the game

4197
07:25:59,439 --> 07:26:08,599
Um, I don't know

4198
07:26:08,599 --> 07:26:13,450
No, i'm not going on another i'm not no i'm not going on. No

4199
07:26:14,169 --> 07:26:17,770
We're not no i'm having this we're just i'm just walked off the edge

4200
07:26:43,419 --> 07:26:45,419
This time I hope I do not get

4201
07:26:45,819 --> 07:26:46,939
double

4202
07:26:46,939 --> 07:26:51,770
Double hit by that yellow flame. That's what happened last time

4203
07:26:52,569 --> 07:26:56,729
It's like it's it was still a little faint whisper of that shit that hit me twice

4204
07:26:57,209 --> 07:27:01,049
No, I don't get hit but at once if you fall on the ground from flame

4205
07:27:01,209 --> 07:27:06,330
I don't know if you know, but don't start rolling just like lay on the ground. Thank you. Thank you that

4206
07:27:07,290 --> 07:27:10,650
I don't it really is that sarcastic? No, no, no, i'm dead serious

4207
07:27:10,650 --> 07:27:13,130
I did I actually did not think about that. That's true

4208
07:27:13,209 --> 07:27:15,529
You you get a lot more eye frames if you lay on the ground

4209
07:27:15,930 --> 07:27:19,930
A lot of dragons will like put you on the ground if you panic and get up it it hits you instantly again

4210
07:27:20,090 --> 07:27:22,090
I you know, i'm not even kidding. I did not know that

4211
07:27:23,369 --> 07:27:28,029
Okay, let's go

4212
07:27:28,270 --> 07:27:31,950
I'm so not sure no, I I swear I promise I promise

4213
07:27:32,669 --> 07:27:49,500
My game lagged like yeah, like okay my game froze

4214
07:27:50,139 --> 07:27:56,540
And then I fell on the ground from the fire. Yeah, and it like it kept a buffered roll and I stood up into the fire again

4215
07:27:57,180 --> 07:27:59,180
Uh, I probably should just die here shouldn't I?

4216
07:28:00,400 --> 07:28:02,400
We were doing really good. We were doing all right

4217
07:28:02,959 --> 07:28:10,639
I got through his health pretty quickly

4218
07:28:10,799 --> 07:28:18,880
Yeah, you actually do a lot of damage compared to what i've been doing. I mean i don't

4219
07:28:19,919 --> 07:28:23,500
I think you could beat him

4220
07:28:35,709 --> 07:28:40,409
Does he know about the dodge button? He's trying to get me to growl at you and i'm not gonna do it

4221
07:28:42,169 --> 07:28:44,330
He did it he's mad more mad than I am

4222
07:28:45,770 --> 07:28:52,110
Stop. Oh, do you not like that? Does that make you like uncomfortable? Can auto hear me is auto uncomfortable?

4223
07:28:56,569 --> 07:28:58,569
Are you just like not like?

4224
07:28:58,970 --> 07:29:00,970
People

4225
07:29:02,169 --> 07:29:11,400
Let's go. Yeah, this one's winnable. Is your monitor turned on? Oh my god

4226
07:29:12,360 --> 07:29:13,979
What the fuck?

4227
07:29:13,979 --> 07:29:15,979
Your mom was turned on last night

4228
07:29:16,459 --> 07:29:18,520
chatter

4229
07:29:18,520 --> 07:29:26,939
because of me

4230
07:29:26,939 --> 07:29:36,029
I yeah, what the heck stop

4231
07:29:36,909 --> 07:29:39,200
rude

4232
07:29:39,200 --> 07:29:42,189
All right. So here's the deal

4233
07:29:42,189 --> 07:29:45,069
If we don't beat him this time, we're gonna go fight another couple of bosses

4234
07:29:47,159 --> 07:29:48,119
Okay

4235
07:29:48,119 --> 07:29:51,959
Okay. Yeah, there's like a million catacombs we can go down into there's tons of stuff

4236
07:29:52,040 --> 07:29:57,880
We don't have to fight like the last like top three top five last bosses in the whole game

4237
07:29:58,520 --> 07:30:00,520
We we we can come back

4238
07:30:03,099 --> 07:30:25,759
Eat your slim jim

4239
07:30:36,360 --> 07:30:38,759
What the fuck are you doing a game?

4240
07:30:39,720 --> 07:30:47,680
Probably fine

4241
07:30:47,680 --> 07:30:54,909
Fucking slay queen

4242
07:30:54,990 --> 07:30:58,250
I'm gonna slay this queen

4243
07:30:58,250 --> 07:31:00,250
Here comes the thingy

4244
07:31:03,849 --> 07:31:07,209
Yeah, we can be hitting him during that we got time. I am terrified of that

4245
07:31:07,849 --> 07:31:13,740
I'll be honest

4246
07:31:13,740 --> 07:31:15,740
Watch out. He's doing that spraying that shit over here

4247
07:31:16,560 --> 07:31:20,560
What the fuck are you talking? Okay, stop being a weirdo

4248
07:31:22,330 --> 07:31:24,330
Yeah, i've gone through a lot of flasks this place

4249
07:31:27,639 --> 07:31:32,279
I prefer phase two at this point. I don't know. We're not we're doing okay. Everything's fine

4250
07:31:33,560 --> 07:31:35,560
That was a quick transition though from

4251
07:31:40,169 --> 07:31:43,049
What I think he hit the wall?

4252
07:31:56,270 --> 07:31:59,069
Oh, you're in trouble. He's doing that stupid shit over there. I'm good

4253
07:32:01,150 --> 07:32:03,869
You're in trouble. Um, no, no, i'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine

4254
07:32:09,639 --> 07:32:11,639
Playing it safe. Yeah me too

4255
07:32:22,509 --> 07:32:24,509
And until he like just hops

4256
07:32:24,669 --> 07:32:27,389
Changes his angle and lights the whole room on fire

4257
07:32:28,349 --> 07:32:45,000
He can do it

4258
07:32:45,000 --> 07:32:47,000
Where the fuck were they?

4259
07:33:01,069 --> 07:33:20,430
Maybe all right. Where do you want to go? The guy's in the wall. I can't see where the fuck he is

4260
07:33:22,169 --> 07:33:28,490
Do you want to go again? You want to prove the haters wrong?

4261
07:33:29,450 --> 07:33:36,990
No, I don't you want to tell them this is a ridiculous boss fight in this tiny supper one more

4262
07:33:40,200 --> 07:33:45,000
All right one more and actually I think it might be better. I have like

4263
07:33:45,639 --> 07:33:51,639
Somebody's lightning liver. Somebody's got it right. I want to just respec and if we beat him that means I get to respec

4264
07:33:52,459 --> 07:33:56,590
Yeah, I just want that that sweet spot

4265
07:33:57,310 --> 07:34:01,689
I think i'm gonna go on like uh

4266
07:34:01,689 --> 07:34:04,810
Use left trigger. I don't think I I don't have enough intelligence to do it

4267
07:34:05,529 --> 07:34:10,040
I don't think I can even do that move

4268
07:34:10,040 --> 07:34:21,340
Don't you need it? Hold on. Oh, I don't like what do you mean? You're too dumb to press left trigger. That's true

4269
07:34:25,659 --> 07:34:27,340
Do a fully charged heavy

4270
07:34:27,340 --> 07:34:33,150
I think it's not gonna do that much more damage

4271
07:34:33,150 --> 07:34:37,900
All right, let's go

4272
07:34:37,900 --> 07:34:42,220
It'll do extra damage, but I have to hold it much longer. I'll try it. See

4273
07:34:42,860 --> 07:35:31,279
Watch out for that fire. You might do it usually does it like right now comes this bullshit

4274
07:35:40,569 --> 07:35:42,569
Yeah, i'm like basically out of flasks

4275
07:35:42,729 --> 07:35:48,189
already

4276
07:35:48,189 --> 07:35:54,680
Jesus

4277
07:35:54,680 --> 07:35:56,680
It's just so hard to see what his body's doing

4278
07:36:02,099 --> 07:36:13,340
Jesus it's like i'm it's like i'm hitting a mountain

4279
07:36:14,619 --> 07:36:15,819
All right

4280
07:36:15,819 --> 07:36:17,819
Pull up swings. Pull up. Pull up

4281
07:36:18,299 --> 07:36:24,959
He's going to second phase. All right, weird weird eat another one of your uh, uh, uh, you know my goober berries. Yes

4282
07:36:27,020 --> 07:36:31,369
spread out too

4283
07:36:31,450 --> 07:36:33,930
Okay, we're good. We're good different. Just just have everybody chill out

4284
07:36:36,000 --> 07:36:44,319
Oh, no

4285
07:36:44,319 --> 07:36:54,990
You gotta be shitting me. I dodged right through it. This was the one

4286
07:36:58,380 --> 07:37:00,009
Yeah

4287
07:37:00,009 --> 07:37:02,729
What that was weird? I don't know what just happened, but he's over here

4288
07:37:07,639 --> 07:37:10,330
Bro, what?

4289
07:37:10,330 --> 07:37:12,330
Are you doing over here man?

4290
07:37:14,040 --> 07:37:18,970
What?

4291
07:37:18,970 --> 07:37:19,930
What?

4292
07:37:19,930 --> 07:37:25,500
Dude, you got so much surface area here. Look at this. So he's gonna pick the same three spots

4293
07:37:36,990 --> 07:37:50,279
I'm so lucky that didn't hit me. All right, here comes the area of back bullshit

4294
07:37:51,000 --> 07:37:53,900
Where'd he go?

4295
07:37:53,900 --> 07:37:56,159
He's gonna drop it on me

4296
07:37:56,159 --> 07:37:58,000
I hope where did he go?

4297
07:37:58,000 --> 07:38:01,560
Oh, he's teleporting

4298
07:38:01,560 --> 07:38:03,560
Yeah, the claw into the flame

4299
07:38:05,880 --> 07:38:09,240
What the fuck is he doing right now, man? He's doing laser beam. He hit him

4300
07:38:45,740 --> 07:38:49,319
Fucking clown box

4301
07:38:51,599 --> 07:38:52,729
I

4302
07:38:52,729 --> 07:39:01,979
I thought you would have had him there too if that didn't hit you but like who can tell what?

4303
07:39:02,220 --> 07:39:06,520
Oh, you need to rest at the bonfire. I'm still in the fight

4304
07:39:07,919 --> 07:39:10,540
What that was so unfair?

4305
07:39:12,040 --> 07:39:14,200
What happened? What did he just what did he do?

4306
07:39:15,000 --> 07:39:17,919
What did he just?

4307
07:39:17,919 --> 07:39:21,020
Happened

4308
07:39:21,020 --> 07:39:23,979
Uh, what happened? He's not playing fair

4309
07:39:24,860 --> 07:39:30,490
He's a weapon you have stats for

4310
07:39:31,099 --> 07:39:33,979
Uh, I had it a store currently owns it. He

4311
07:39:34,779 --> 07:39:36,779
The store has it in his inventory

4312
07:39:38,889 --> 07:39:42,650
The issue is not the damage you're doing more damage than me

4313
07:39:44,319 --> 07:39:46,000
the issue is

4314
07:39:46,000 --> 07:39:51,520
Sometimes uses flame attacks. So what why did I then you die? Okay, so he did a flame attack

4315
07:39:52,939 --> 07:39:56,220
And then it was over and then I died. Was that the laser?

4316
07:39:56,939 --> 07:40:02,220
That's the one where he goes super psycho mode and does lasers in like 400 million directions. Oh my god

4317
07:40:02,380 --> 07:40:06,090
We both got yeah

4318
07:40:06,090 --> 07:40:10,680
Oh, can we do a warming stone?

4319
07:40:10,680 --> 07:40:15,000
Somebody said two hand the shield. That's not a bad idea. That might actually work

4320
07:40:15,950 --> 07:40:26,090
I wonder no don't potion why because we can put a warming stone down before we go in

4321
07:40:27,689 --> 07:40:31,240
All right, we can just chill out we can talk about

4322
07:40:32,619 --> 07:40:35,979
I can't I I thought he was dead too. I thought his move was over

4323
07:40:36,060 --> 07:40:57,790
I don't even know what I got hit by don't go in he was near a pillar his laser explodes on contact with ground

4324
07:40:57,790 --> 07:40:59,389
You stood near his head

4325
07:40:59,389 --> 07:41:01,549
Which was near the pillar and the

4326
07:41:03,919 --> 07:41:07,520
The laser beam exploded the pillar. Oh, that's so sad

4327
07:41:08,240 --> 07:41:10,080
That's so sad

4328
07:41:10,080 --> 07:41:12,080
Shots four and five clearly missed

4329
07:41:19,229 --> 07:41:22,590
I'm gonna drop a warming stone during like the phase transition as well

4330
07:41:26,909 --> 07:41:29,709
I didn't mean to do that. I'm just so shooken up right now

4331
07:41:31,770 --> 07:41:50,810
Sorry, we'll get a writer

4332
07:41:50,810 --> 07:41:52,810
You gotta seriously dude

4333
07:41:53,799 --> 07:41:57,720
I'm dead

4334
07:41:57,720 --> 07:42:03,319
I got trapped

4335
07:42:03,319 --> 07:42:05,560
I got trapped. He did it twice in the same area

4336
07:42:06,200 --> 07:42:11,759
I need you to focus up, dude

4337
07:42:11,759 --> 07:42:13,759
The guild needs this

4338
07:42:16,509 --> 07:42:20,270
Okay, you have no idea how hard I was just holding it not just getting wicked pissed

4339
07:42:21,529 --> 07:42:27,360
Okay, we're good. I'm so glad you said that because that was really funny and it just like

4340
07:42:32,060 --> 07:42:41,259
The fact that the guild needs me right now is that's so funny I was about to be like the fuck do you know

4341
07:42:42,779 --> 07:42:46,619
You're gonna do like a noise like that. No one's gonna know what it means. But like you would know

4342
07:42:53,740 --> 07:43:25,560
Okay, it's a combination of being in the right place

4343
07:43:26,119 --> 07:43:27,930
Not being too greedy

4344
07:43:27,930 --> 07:43:33,529
Uh getting good rng on the moves. I mean the area is tiny. There's not a whole lot of wiggle room

4345
07:43:34,009 --> 07:43:37,529
I forget how you even double hand your your shield on your offhand

4346
07:43:39,400 --> 07:43:42,919
Uh, I can but uh, I was just told that that does not help

4347
07:43:43,639 --> 07:43:45,000
Oh, okay

4348
07:43:45,000 --> 07:43:51,000
From what I was told could be wrong. Let's try it again

4349
07:43:51,639 --> 07:43:55,959
I'm only gonna use the clam powder the clam chowder in the second phase

4350
07:43:56,680 --> 07:44:00,650
I used all mine

4351
07:44:00,889 --> 07:44:02,810
Oh, I felt like six

4352
07:44:02,810 --> 07:44:03,930
Really?

4353
07:44:03,930 --> 07:44:40,250
Yeah

4354
07:44:40,250 --> 07:44:42,250
That's the claw fire

4355
07:44:42,810 --> 07:44:44,009
And

4356
07:44:44,009 --> 07:44:53,799
There's nowhere to go

4357
07:44:53,799 --> 07:44:54,759
No

4358
07:44:54,759 --> 07:44:59,549
No, no

4359
07:44:59,549 --> 07:45:21,580
No

4360
07:45:21,580 --> 07:45:23,580
Nice nice. He's staggered. Ooh

4361
07:45:29,849 --> 07:46:06,110
All right, dropping a warming stone in the center. Yep. He's going up easy easy careful

4362
07:46:08,919 --> 07:46:26,159
All right smelling warming stone in the center. I had no idea where he was. He says all right fire incoming

4363
07:46:56,319 --> 07:46:57,439
you

4364
07:46:57,439 --> 07:47:01,770
Can't be serious. All right. It's all right. Sorry you got he killed me instantly with the laser

4365
07:47:02,409 --> 07:47:43,099
Yeah, I like saw you die in one shot. You got it. You got it. Come on for the guild. Where the fuck is he?

4366
07:47:52,319 --> 07:47:55,930
Okay, I couldn't even hit him

4367
07:47:56,650 --> 07:48:25,770
I thought he was doing the fire after the swings. I started trying to run. I know there was like a return swing

4368
07:48:26,599 --> 07:48:33,450
Okay, so the lightning once he's in when he's in phase two do not be in front of him for any reason

4369
07:48:34,599 --> 07:48:37,080
He does that laser light show and it instantly kills you

4370
07:48:38,159 --> 07:48:41,200
That's what killed you the other time and it goes on for a really long time

4371
07:48:42,799 --> 07:48:47,040
That's unfortunate. I'm out of warming stones, too. I think they helped a lot. I don't know if you have any

4372
07:48:47,360 --> 07:48:52,680
Uh, let me check. I don't think I do though. We could that was so close. I think we can do it warming stones

4373
07:48:54,270 --> 07:48:58,279
I don't think I have any

4374
07:48:58,279 --> 07:49:00,279
No, I don't think so

4375
07:49:00,279 --> 07:49:04,560
I might have I mean buff on

4376
07:49:04,560 --> 07:49:10,189
Shit, I don't know how I would check we could take rune arcs. Couldn't we I do have a debuff on?

4377
07:49:10,669 --> 07:49:13,150
Fuck I had a reduced attack debuff

4378
07:49:16,540 --> 07:49:20,139
Apparently the warming stones heal the bots. Oh do they?

4379
07:49:20,779 --> 07:49:22,139
That's so funny

4380
07:49:22,139 --> 07:49:30,029
Oh, all right. I mean that was that was pretty good. That was pretty good. This is tough. This is not easy

4381
07:49:30,590 --> 07:49:32,159
This is tricky

4382
07:49:32,159 --> 07:49:42,459
Your weapon is a stagger do jump attacks

4383
07:49:43,020 --> 07:49:46,060
I mean I do it just it's hard to get in there, but I I do

4384
07:49:47,819 --> 07:49:49,819
Oh my god. Okay. I am

4385
07:49:52,650 --> 07:49:57,290
I want to see if we can I forget if there's a shortcut over here because I need to rest the bonfire get rid of my

4386
07:49:57,290 --> 07:50:00,599
debuff

4387
07:50:00,599 --> 07:50:02,520
What you have a debuff right now or no, you didn't yeah

4388
07:50:02,919 --> 07:50:06,680
I think during that fight I had a reduced attack debuff the whole time really

4389
07:50:06,919 --> 07:50:09,720
Well, let's just let's do this. Let's go up and take care of this shit

4390
07:50:10,680 --> 07:50:17,150
What is going on?

4391
07:50:17,959 --> 07:50:22,200
Because of the weird way that like last time I died and you had to reset it and then I resp I don't know

4392
07:50:22,599 --> 07:50:25,880
Uh, what's gonna happen or how long I had it. Let's turn the stupid ball off

4393
07:50:29,439 --> 07:50:31,680
Well, we can just do this shortcut for now on

4394
07:50:32,240 --> 07:50:40,799
I'm getting rid of that ball. Well, I'm saying the shortcut ignores the ball. Oh, never mind. There's a giant dog up here

4395
07:50:40,799 --> 07:50:42,799
I don't care about that anymore

4396
07:50:42,799 --> 07:50:51,290
I'm gonna go rest. I'll be back

4397
07:50:51,369 --> 07:50:53,369
Shortcut is literally going to be worse. Apparently why?

4398
07:50:54,669 --> 07:50:57,869
Uh, it seems a lot better because of the random enemies that are there

4399
07:50:58,029 --> 07:51:06,509
They're not like super threatening the way they normally are. Where did you go all the way back? Yeah, I rested

4400
07:51:12,590 --> 07:51:14,590
It's usually worse

4401
07:51:14,990 --> 07:51:18,430
Yeah, because they usually spam like homing magic at you. But right now it's like

4402
07:51:20,180 --> 07:51:24,279
Undead that are just like kind of looking at me. I just ran right by everyone. There's no problem

4403
07:51:25,240 --> 07:51:26,680
It's way easier

4404
07:51:26,680 --> 07:51:30,119
Uh, and then we then we don't need to deal with the ball. Let me actually

4405
07:51:30,919 --> 07:51:33,959
I I have six flasks. I need to get my field back up

4406
07:51:34,840 --> 07:51:36,840
Okay, I should

4407
07:51:36,919 --> 07:51:39,400
Man, I forgot but I should take my mana flask off

4408
07:51:40,520 --> 07:51:46,380
Because i'm not really casting mat. Jesus. Fuck that was longer ranged. I thought i'm just I don't I'm just going

4409
07:51:46,380 --> 07:51:48,380
I don't even care. I'm just gonna go back

4410
07:51:48,619 --> 07:51:52,590
I could beat this boss by myself

4411
07:51:54,540 --> 07:51:56,540
Are you you respawned at the bonfire, right?

4412
07:51:57,740 --> 07:52:00,700
I'm i'm killing myself and i'm gonna i'm gonna come back with you

4413
07:52:01,340 --> 07:52:04,700
So that I can reset my flask like one extra flask would help a lot. Yeah

4414
07:52:05,259 --> 07:52:06,459
um

4415
07:52:06,459 --> 07:52:08,779
We've gotten him two or three times down to like

4416
07:52:09,720 --> 07:52:11,240
less than five percent

4417
07:52:11,240 --> 07:52:17,799
When are you gonna play the great ace attorney games?

4418
07:52:17,799 --> 07:52:20,919
My uncle doesn't care because he doesn't know who you are, but I do

4419
07:52:22,840 --> 07:52:30,509
Uh, what does your uncle have to do with any of that? That's

4420
07:52:31,389 --> 07:52:39,549
I don't I don't expect your uncle to know who I am. I'll play it

4421
07:52:46,479 --> 07:52:48,479
Yeah, but he's gonna play jade cocoon first

4422
07:52:49,040 --> 07:52:51,040
I actually need to find that game

4423
07:52:51,680 --> 07:53:15,319
Are you guys just hoping that the second boss is gonna be easier when you kill this one?

4424
07:53:18,299 --> 07:53:20,299
I don't think there is one

4425
07:53:20,299 --> 07:53:22,299
There wasn't a phase two for rayo lucario

4426
07:53:22,860 --> 07:53:27,689
Would it be a phase two for this? Well, I mean that boss doesn't usually have phase two the base boss

4427
07:53:27,770 --> 07:53:32,250
But I still don't do like it doesn't matter. We're gonna win right now. I don't want to hear anyone say

4428
07:53:34,009 --> 07:53:39,529
It does nothing matters. We're about to win right now. So like doesn't even matter what you're saying, you know, that's a good point

4429
07:53:40,169 --> 07:53:44,330
Because we are the hey bod watchers. This is the one skip to here

4430
07:53:45,610 --> 07:53:56,490
Because it does just a bad start like I just got screwed

4431
07:54:02,650 --> 07:54:07,529
Again again just really poor really just bad fucking start overall bad

4432
07:54:09,279 --> 07:54:13,919
It was just a bad start overall. It was a bad start overall. I could feel it the second we walked through the door

4433
07:54:14,479 --> 07:54:15,520
Okay

4434
07:54:15,520 --> 07:54:19,599
The vibe was off. It was the vibe was so wrong. It was off completely

4435
07:54:20,639 --> 07:54:26,509
It's just like I would I would do a move and he would time it perfectly to put something on the ground that

4436
07:54:27,310 --> 07:54:30,590
You know what? I mean? It was just the vibe was just the vibes were off on that

4437
07:54:30,669 --> 07:54:33,790
The fight always starts off three lightnings

4438
07:54:35,290 --> 07:54:38,909
Be aware be aware. I know but the just do the vibe

4439
07:54:40,029 --> 07:54:48,909
I'm not disagreeing with you. The vibe was off dude

4440
07:54:49,069 --> 07:54:55,790
If I just had like glint stone omega kamehameha and then I could fucking kamehameha him and then hit the gritty

4441
07:54:59,080 --> 07:55:00,599
Hit the gritty

4442
07:55:00,599 --> 07:55:02,000
Yeah

4443
07:55:02,000 --> 07:55:05,040
Okay, come on. He doesn't know we can do it

4444
07:55:05,599 --> 07:55:10,619
We have been playing for eight hours. I mean that doesn't have it might be hitting game or fatigue. It's possible

4445
07:55:11,340 --> 07:55:14,430
Yeah for like old people

4446
07:55:14,430 --> 07:55:18,810
Well, I I we could be hitting game or fatigue

4447
07:55:19,529 --> 07:55:21,630
For old people

4448
07:55:21,630 --> 07:55:24,569
You didn't even eat

4449
07:55:24,569 --> 07:55:26,939
Do I need to yeah

4450
07:55:26,939 --> 07:55:33,659
No fasting it keeps your mind present like i'm i'm on the hunt for some food and that food is pasadousis axes

4451
07:55:36,700 --> 07:55:39,520
What is this character's name?

4452
07:55:39,520 --> 07:55:44,400
Me strong. No, no, no the boss we're fighting get it right and spell it correctly and i'll give you 100 dollars

4453
07:55:46,169 --> 07:55:48,409
pass

4454
07:55:48,409 --> 07:55:54,560
Placid do sex. Okay. Now now now do it for me do what for you? I don't know either

4455
07:55:55,819 --> 07:55:57,819
It's like placid oxics

4456
07:55:57,819 --> 07:56:01,580
I think I could have done it if we took a moment, but I want to fucking fight this thing

4457
07:56:01,580 --> 07:56:04,380
Can you be like focused you like dodge a little red lightning that's about to come down?

4458
07:56:06,040 --> 07:56:10,759
Not take any like greed swings and like die in the first fucking phase. I didn't

4459
07:56:13,759 --> 07:56:15,759
You show me what your made up for the guild

4460
07:56:20,139 --> 07:56:24,700
You got double hit by the fire guy, but I did I didn't know but you don't understand. I didn't jump

4461
07:56:25,020 --> 07:56:27,020
I didn't get up. I did what you said

4462
07:56:28,509 --> 07:56:30,509
Seems like I only got hit once

4463
07:56:30,909 --> 07:56:46,779
What even just I hit my head on the fucking treasure box. I'm just relaxed

4464
07:56:48,270 --> 07:56:54,759
guild needs you

4465
07:56:54,759 --> 07:56:57,560
Fucking only fighter that's online at this time

4466
07:57:00,200 --> 07:57:02,200
You don't understand. I got so screwed

4467
07:57:10,880 --> 07:57:13,500
I mean like just run away

4468
07:57:14,119 --> 07:57:19,240
If you're worried you're gonna get hit you can also always like you you actually can't go anywhere when he does that. Oh my god

4469
07:57:20,119 --> 07:57:22,090
Did I do it?

4470
07:57:22,090 --> 07:57:23,049
Yeah

4471
07:57:23,049 --> 07:57:25,689
I didn't

4472
07:57:25,930 --> 07:57:27,930
I thought you're gonna yell at me and say don't do it

4473
07:57:27,930 --> 07:57:32,169
So I tried to predict I was on the ground the whole time. I tried. No, no, we're good. We're good. Everything's fine

4474
07:57:32,650 --> 07:57:34,650
We're good. We did a lot of damage

4475
07:57:35,049 --> 07:57:38,330
Everyone's screaming at me. You don't understand the last few times. It's like we're good

4476
07:57:41,470 --> 07:57:43,439
Oh dodged

4477
07:57:43,439 --> 07:57:45,439
like a mouse

4478
07:57:53,520 --> 07:57:55,520
Okay focus

4479
07:57:58,240 --> 07:58:00,240
You gotta focus

4480
07:58:01,200 --> 07:58:03,200
That was so stupid

4481
07:58:09,689 --> 07:58:14,909
Bringing it back

4482
07:58:14,909 --> 07:58:18,509
You can't even see when the rocks come out. It's such what's manure

4483
07:58:19,389 --> 07:58:23,610
Oh my i'm just getting infinite combo

4484
07:58:26,840 --> 07:58:27,880
beam

4485
07:58:27,880 --> 07:58:40,360
It's a good thing. I'd use three flasks for that

4486
07:58:44,189 --> 07:58:52,619
Okay, it's getting close to beam health like don't don't get beamed. I'm gonna try as hard as I can to not get beamed

4487
07:58:53,500 --> 07:59:00,830
Do we even know do we even know?

4488
07:59:02,200 --> 07:59:04,889
Do we even know

4489
07:59:04,889 --> 07:59:06,889
What lies beyond in the infinite void?

4490
07:59:07,450 --> 07:59:09,610
He's beaming into the wall. Now's our opportunity

4491
07:59:14,830 --> 07:59:20,029
That was such a huge rng player right there. Come on. Come on. Come on. Kill him. Kill him. Come on like a boss, man

4492
07:59:20,750 --> 07:59:22,750
Like a fucking boss

4493
07:59:23,389 --> 07:59:26,029
Oh, thank all right. No phase two. No phase two. No phase two

4494
07:59:34,250 --> 07:59:40,319
Oh, I skipped I don't

4495
07:59:42,840 --> 07:59:44,840
All right, we got it we got it we got it

4496
07:59:45,479 --> 08:00:08,939
Sucks it's the easiest boss of the fucking whole game. Just relax. Just take your time. Look at that damage. Look at that

4497
08:01:02,540 --> 08:01:04,540
Stop don't laugh. Don't laugh

4498
08:01:06,040 --> 08:01:08,040
What you're gonna get me going don't

4499
08:01:08,040 --> 08:01:36,590
Are you i'm alive stay alive stay alive, dude, if you have to just warming stone back there do it

4500
08:01:37,159 --> 08:01:45,389
I don't have any I was my low hp every once in a while

4501
08:01:45,389 --> 08:02:08,250
I'm gonna hit one time and then run away to take out girl fucker

4502
08:02:08,889 --> 08:03:04,779
That one didn't count

4503
08:03:07,049 --> 08:03:09,290
Oh, this weapon is fucking slow as shit

4504
08:03:10,700 --> 08:03:19,069
With my sword alone. I was having a hard time getting a single hit in well that was um, that was interesting

4505
08:03:19,310 --> 08:03:28,720
This is easy like a boss

4506
08:03:32,990 --> 08:03:37,389
Oh, I feel like I could have done that too. It's just it's been so long since seeing that second phase

4507
08:03:37,630 --> 08:03:39,630
I got fucking one shot by the bow

4508
08:03:39,709 --> 08:03:42,990
That thing is always so hard for me to dodge like in the beginning of radon's fight

4509
08:03:43,150 --> 08:03:46,270
And he's like i'm gonna shoot one really slow missile at you across the map

4510
08:03:46,349 --> 08:03:50,830
I always miss time it the bow my weakness you gotta go forward. You gotta dodge forward

4511
08:03:51,630 --> 08:03:57,790
Only go forward. So you like make sense only dodge forward if you dodge back left or right you'll get hit by it every time

4512
08:03:58,599 --> 08:04:00,119
especially

4513
08:04:00,119 --> 08:04:04,220
okay, so um

4514
08:04:04,220 --> 08:04:08,720
Respawn and then go up the shortcut. I don't know why we went ball away. I don't know

4515
08:04:09,520 --> 08:04:15,689
I think I didn't remove my buff either. I don't know if I have one nice bald spot where

4516
08:04:16,330 --> 08:04:24,590
Where shouldn't have one because we both like did actual real dying. So I have a question is that always going to be uh,

4517
08:04:26,729 --> 08:04:36,159
Yeah

4518
08:04:36,159 --> 08:04:38,080
Do I have grease my check you still i'm gonna use grease

4519
08:04:38,080 --> 08:04:43,599
But uh, actually chat i'm using an intellect sword and it scales with arcane magic and you can't put grease on magic swords

4520
08:04:44,000 --> 08:04:48,240
Your vibes are off bro. When's the last time you guys hit the no. No, no someone's saying your vibes are off man

4521
08:04:48,240 --> 08:04:58,220
When was the last time you hit the splinky? You know, that's true. I feel better. I feel a lot better

4522
08:04:58,779 --> 08:05:00,939
We crushed placid axe

4523
08:05:01,819 --> 08:05:12,029
Flaccid man, I feel actually I feel pretty good now. What's your what's that thing's weapon art that you said you can't use

4524
08:05:12,590 --> 08:05:15,150
I think it's a big like earthquake. It's a big like purple earthquake

4525
08:05:19,419 --> 08:05:21,919
All right. Let's try it again

4526
08:05:27,439 --> 08:05:30,720
All right vibes are better. I feel pretty good vibes have been returned

4527
08:05:32,669 --> 08:05:34,669
Yo, we're just chilling

4528
08:05:35,389 --> 08:05:37,389
We are super

4529
08:05:37,630 --> 08:05:40,110
duper gamers

4530
08:05:40,110 --> 08:05:41,630
Just vibing out

4531
08:05:41,709 --> 08:05:46,490
I hurt a little bit

4532
08:05:46,490 --> 08:05:58,590
And no stamp you've just a bad start just a bad. No, it really was though. Like I was fine

4533
08:05:58,669 --> 08:06:01,709
It's just I ran out of fucking stamina and then he hit me like with his elbow

4534
08:06:02,830 --> 08:06:05,790
Bro hit me with his fucking elbow. Like I was fine

4535
08:06:07,599 --> 08:06:09,959
wrong vibe

4536
08:06:09,959 --> 08:06:12,520
Like I don't know. He he like he turned

4537
08:06:13,240 --> 08:06:17,639
and

4538
08:06:17,639 --> 08:06:39,439
Can we get a priest for the rez crouch into r1?

4539
08:06:43,020 --> 08:06:45,020
What the hell is this move?

4540
08:06:46,090 --> 08:06:48,090
What is this weird ass move?

4541
08:06:49,400 --> 08:07:00,860
Yeah, that's what cheaters use

4542
08:07:00,939 --> 08:07:05,040
It's so good

4543
08:07:05,040 --> 08:07:08,400
All right for a second. I thought this was you they they did nerf it at some point

4544
08:07:08,479 --> 08:07:13,279
so I don't uh the door this this fucking asshole piece of

4545
08:07:14,220 --> 08:07:17,200
Scum was blocking the door. I couldn't go through

4546
08:07:28,799 --> 08:07:31,759
The vibe was off. Make sure you rest the debuff

4547
08:07:32,400 --> 08:07:35,549
The vibes are fine. It's just just blocking the door

4548
08:07:39,930 --> 08:07:43,659
Peter griffin here. I wish you luck with the boss fight

4549
08:07:44,299 --> 08:08:01,400
Thanks peter

4550
08:08:01,400 --> 08:08:02,840
you forgot um

4551
08:08:02,919 --> 08:08:04,919
Family guy is sponsored in pot by

4552
08:08:06,540 --> 08:08:08,939
That means you're not the real peter griffin. That's how I know

4553
08:08:18,400 --> 08:08:21,599
All right. I'm gonna i'm gonna let's give this one more try and then

4554
08:08:22,639 --> 08:08:26,639
We're double bossing and I have like a plus five weapon that I can't even equip correctly

4555
08:08:27,360 --> 08:08:29,680
It's plus four

4556
08:08:29,680 --> 08:08:31,680
We are double bossing right now

4557
08:08:32,479 --> 08:08:33,770
That's true

4558
08:08:33,770 --> 08:08:38,729
Vibe check vibe check don't get locked in the corner. Be careful. Hold on. Take your time run away from the lightning

4559
08:08:38,889 --> 08:08:42,970
I'm not quite sure about that vibe here right now. Let me see give me a minute

4560
08:08:46,970 --> 08:08:49,290
Like in you're like in the fight vibes are on

4561
08:08:54,279 --> 08:08:58,119
Already vibes are off

4562
08:08:58,119 --> 08:09:13,040
Already i'm getting out of the corner

4563
08:09:23,849 --> 08:09:28,830
No

4564
08:09:28,830 --> 08:09:31,709
There's nowhere to go. You just die

4565
08:09:31,709 --> 08:09:37,869
Vibes were off that one. All right, if you get hit by that fire, you just die. I got hit by it

4566
08:09:38,590 --> 08:09:40,590
How come I got up slower than you?

4567
08:09:46,090 --> 08:09:48,009
The vibes were fucking terrible

4568
08:09:48,009 --> 08:09:51,099
kill me

4569
08:09:51,099 --> 08:09:52,860
I walked into it

4570
08:09:52,860 --> 08:09:57,500
Dude, but I can't even see what this motherfucker is doing for a move. It's like

4571
08:10:02,009 --> 08:10:04,009
That's been this entire fight. All right

4572
08:10:05,049 --> 08:10:12,349
Relax relax relax

4573
08:10:12,349 --> 08:10:14,650
And vibes is just killing me right?

4574
08:10:21,979 --> 08:10:25,150
kill me

4575
08:10:25,150 --> 08:10:27,150
How are you alive and you're trying to die?

4576
08:10:29,360 --> 08:10:31,520
I was trying a bit. I thought it was funny

4577
08:10:33,880 --> 08:10:36,439
I just like shook. I just shook my whole room

4578
08:10:38,279 --> 08:10:40,779
All right. I am doing a veto

4579
08:10:41,240 --> 08:10:43,240
Vibe stamp right now

4580
08:10:44,000 --> 08:10:47,919
Can we please do one where you don't die in like the first 10 seconds? No, the vibes are off

4581
08:10:48,000 --> 08:10:53,200
Okay, I legitimately think we have it if you can just like just here's what we're gonna do. Here's the strat

4582
08:10:53,200 --> 08:10:56,720
We're gonna run in we're gonna go up for the first 20 seconds of the boss fight

4583
08:10:57,919 --> 08:11:01,599
I don't want you to hit hit the boss more than one time and then just like walk away

4584
08:11:01,759 --> 08:11:08,569
Yeah, but I got the fucking strike twice in a row. Yeah, like do like a jump attack. Did I like shrink?

4585
08:11:08,650 --> 08:11:10,330
Why is this like so huge?

4586
08:11:10,330 --> 08:11:42,520
I'm gonna try that strategy the crouch into swing

4587
08:11:43,240 --> 08:11:47,610
See if it works

4588
08:11:47,610 --> 08:11:50,040
Is that the the heavy poke?

4589
08:11:50,040 --> 08:11:51,400
Yeah, like this thing

4590
08:11:51,400 --> 08:12:09,180
I wonder if it's behind you behind you behind you behind you he's dead. Yeah first playthrough. No spoilers, please never seen this boss

4591
08:12:51,979 --> 08:12:58,319
What turning animation did like a full s this worth of damage?

4592
08:12:59,200 --> 08:14:00,700
Okay, here we go

4593
08:14:00,700 --> 08:14:02,700
What the fuck is that bullshit?

4594
08:14:05,020 --> 08:14:10,060
I I was like so bright. Oh, wow. What a clean dodge. Oh totally boom. You're dead

4595
08:14:10,779 --> 08:14:12,779
Like a fucking hour later

4596
08:14:12,939 --> 08:14:15,759
We're gonna beat this whole thing right now watch

4597
08:14:16,240 --> 08:14:31,470
Not even a fucking scratch. I'm fine

4598
08:14:31,470 --> 08:14:41,549
Okay

4599
08:14:41,549 --> 08:14:45,630
That this is uh, this is way too hard for what we have right now. Let's go

4600
08:14:46,029 --> 08:14:48,270
I think it'll be really funny. Let's like do like a catacombs

4601
08:14:48,349 --> 08:14:52,110
We're gonna get to the end boss and it's gonna be like so just a guy named like charles

4602
08:14:52,509 --> 08:14:57,360
And we could feel good about that. I need you to rest. I'm like locked in the boss room

4603
08:14:57,520 --> 08:15:03,599
I need to get enough intelligence to use this weapon correctly or take the finger out of your inventory

4604
08:15:04,560 --> 08:15:11,040
I can't do that for you. I need to do it. I need you to do that. I need to take my finger out of your

4605
08:15:12,000 --> 08:15:14,560
You know, I need that it's a plus seven

4606
08:15:16,139 --> 08:15:17,180
Yeah

4607
08:15:17,180 --> 08:15:23,580
Yeah, it is it is it is like okay, like a 30 probably damage increase definitely know what?

4608
08:15:24,880 --> 08:15:25,919
um

4609
08:15:25,919 --> 08:15:34,029
So let's go to it. Let's go to one of the catacombs. Where's a good one something quick something easy

4610
08:15:34,430 --> 08:15:41,049
I forget where they are. I mean probably go to the artist shack and there's one around there

4611
08:15:41,049 --> 08:16:04,830
I forget exactly where the starting I think there is one like down here like over here. Hey, can you freak out?

4612
08:16:05,229 --> 08:16:13,040
No, I could also just go to that urn tree

4613
08:16:14,959 --> 08:16:19,919
Like like anywhere we can we can go anywhere and do anything this whole wide open world is open to us

4614
08:16:20,240 --> 08:16:24,720
Somebody said why do you get redder every time you die? I wonder why that is

4615
08:16:26,919 --> 08:16:30,520
Why would somebody get red? I just keep getting redder apparently

4616
08:16:31,080 --> 08:16:34,029
I know you're changing the hue on your camera

4617
08:16:35,709 --> 08:16:42,330
Okay, we're gonna relax going up let's just go do a dungeon go clear a boss go get me

4618
08:16:43,369 --> 08:16:47,290
You know another few smithing stones and all that stuff and we'll be good to go

4619
08:16:47,930 --> 08:16:51,689
Okay, where exactly?

4620
08:16:51,770 --> 08:16:52,650
I

4621
08:16:52,650 --> 08:16:57,689
I think there's one there's one here right like in the middle of the lake or like at the end of the lake

4622
08:16:58,169 --> 08:17:00,729
There's one here. Uh

4623
08:17:00,729 --> 08:17:02,729
Come this way

4624
08:17:02,990 --> 08:17:05,630
And I also down there is the the first boater

4625
08:17:07,360 --> 08:17:15,840
Mariner I think is relic right here. I haven't been looking at the mod chat at all. I'm sorry

4626
08:17:16,479 --> 08:17:26,810
I don't know. Is there anything important in here?

4627
08:17:26,810 --> 08:17:28,810
Lol. Yeah, we realized

4628
08:17:28,810 --> 08:17:44,520
I thought I did

4629
08:17:44,520 --> 08:17:46,279
Uh, did you go down?

4630
08:17:46,279 --> 08:17:51,950
Yeah, this is the pat. No, there's like a big bear in this cave. Usually

4631
08:17:52,669 --> 08:18:05,360
Smith and stone seven. I could probably actually upgrade my weapon quite a bit too

4632
08:18:06,319 --> 08:18:10,090
Like already with the stuff that I have

4633
08:18:10,729 --> 08:18:13,040
I just need ruins and I just need

4634
08:18:13,360 --> 08:18:15,790
another somber stone

4635
08:18:15,950 --> 08:18:18,029
I wish I could

4636
08:18:18,029 --> 08:18:19,770
this whole thing

4637
08:18:19,770 --> 08:18:22,590
Just got so twisted up

4638
08:18:22,669 --> 08:18:26,110
Because I put 30 points in strength because I had a fucking meltdown

4639
08:18:27,229 --> 08:18:28,430
I was

4640
08:18:28,430 --> 08:18:35,069
So excited to get that and I just used it all and it was just it was really fun. It was really exciting

4641
08:18:36,840 --> 08:18:40,319
I mean

4642
08:18:40,319 --> 08:18:42,080
It was very exciting

4643
08:18:42,080 --> 08:18:44,080
A lot of people would have done the same

4644
08:18:44,159 --> 08:18:51,200
Right now this is up to kayla dude. I'm so lost. I forget all the beginning like many areas

4645
08:18:53,020 --> 08:18:58,279
Um there we could also go back to castle more and fight that boss. We could probably kill it easily now

4646
08:18:59,560 --> 08:19:00,990
Come over here

4647
08:19:00,990 --> 08:19:03,470
It was the the deer. Where are you?

4648
08:19:05,290 --> 08:19:07,020
Uh, are you?

4649
08:19:07,020 --> 08:19:12,880
And there's some water village. There's a place to go down. I think this is just a boss right in here

4650
08:19:17,159 --> 08:19:23,740
Just uh, oh, yeah, this is where the mariner would be and then I think there also is a basement

4651
08:19:24,680 --> 08:19:29,290
There's a there's the gargoyle out here. I wish we could like ping

4652
08:19:30,409 --> 08:19:34,330
You're like I I see him. Okay, let's go get him by the gargoyle. All right

4653
08:19:34,330 --> 08:19:41,959
Let's go for it. It's dangerous. Get out of here tibia kindred

4654
08:19:55,959 --> 08:19:58,439
Uh, oh, uh, we have a bird

4655
08:19:59,159 --> 08:20:04,779
Oh my god, dude

4656
08:20:05,020 --> 08:20:07,340
Let's hear this fucking giant crow

4657
08:20:09,439 --> 08:20:12,479
I'm gonna pull the crow back here. He just got in the bus

4658
08:20:17,959 --> 08:20:21,080
You don't you dare kill me. Don't you dare kill me?

4659
08:20:26,380 --> 08:20:27,819
Okay, he's dead

4660
08:20:27,819 --> 08:20:36,919
Am I playing co-op right now? I had dude one of those giant crows came over

4661
08:20:37,000 --> 08:20:39,639
I that would have been the end of this whole run if I didn't kill that

4662
08:21:02,509 --> 08:21:04,509
Wow, he he led the target

4663
08:21:14,400 --> 08:21:16,400
Why can't we just kill him?

4664
08:21:16,720 --> 08:21:24,430
Okay

4665
08:21:24,430 --> 08:21:26,919
Epic, okay

4666
08:21:26,919 --> 08:21:37,040
Now let's go down and see what's in there. Where is it over here? Right?

4667
08:21:42,889 --> 08:21:46,330
I forget. I am for random items. Yeah

4668
08:21:47,049 --> 08:21:49,580
I think it's over here

4669
08:21:49,580 --> 08:21:54,110
On the other side, I think you forgot already

4670
08:21:55,240 --> 08:21:59,240
Yeah, I don't mean like this whole place. Look, I'm right here identical. The whole thing looks identical

4671
08:21:59,799 --> 08:22:10,959
Why you'd really diss the elden ring art team like that?

4672
08:22:13,689 --> 08:22:23,340
And it's like a little like a sugar cube on the ground to go in you thought it was coming

4673
08:22:24,220 --> 08:22:30,009
Getting cookbooks

4674
08:22:30,009 --> 08:22:32,759
Yeah, that was kind of not worth it

4675
08:22:32,759 --> 08:22:36,430
Well, it was content complete it progress

4676
08:22:37,310 --> 08:22:40,110
I didn't want to even kill that deer, but I had to

4677
08:22:45,229 --> 08:22:47,229
Let's go all the way down castle moore

4678
08:22:47,790 --> 08:22:58,759
Yeah, I need a sacred tier yesterday. I really do that would be like the number one

4679
08:22:59,979 --> 08:23:02,939
Best thing did you uh teleport castle mooring, right?

4680
08:23:03,819 --> 08:23:06,220
Um beside the rampart goal all the way at the bottom

4681
08:23:07,020 --> 08:23:08,860
Oh, right, right, right

4682
08:23:08,860 --> 08:23:10,650
um

4683
08:23:10,650 --> 08:23:14,250
Yeah, people thought I was gonna growl. That's why I did them. I'm gonna growl

4684
08:23:14,810 --> 08:23:30,189
Do you like beans and hot dogs? Yeah, that sounds amazing, dude that

4685
08:23:32,430 --> 08:23:33,950
It actually is really good

4686
08:23:33,950 --> 08:23:37,599
Okay, I haven't had one in a while. I think I got some some

4687
08:23:38,479 --> 08:23:44,159
Something like that. This is gonna kill me. Did you ever get that lasagna?

4688
08:23:44,959 --> 08:23:47,470
Uh, you're gonna get a lasagna earlier. No, no, no

4689
08:23:48,750 --> 08:23:53,930
No beans and hot dogs is great

4690
08:23:55,869 --> 08:23:59,259
Perfect. All right. We should definitely be able to do this now

4691
08:24:26,040 --> 08:24:29,790
Oh, come on. Really?

4692
08:24:29,790 --> 08:24:31,790
You're being quinge

4693
08:24:32,029 --> 08:24:34,110
Don't do it. Oh, he respawns here

4694
08:24:35,630 --> 08:24:36,830
Or not

4695
08:24:36,830 --> 08:24:37,950
Uh-oh

4696
08:24:37,950 --> 08:24:42,029
Uh, is that actual I think he's gonna actual spawn. Is he gonna suck them all up or what?

4697
08:24:44,319 --> 08:24:45,200
No

4698
08:24:45,200 --> 08:24:56,720
All right. He sucked them all up. Do they respawn? I don't think so, right?

4699
08:24:57,520 --> 08:24:59,520
He might have a move that spawns them

4700
08:25:01,400 --> 08:25:03,400
Yeah, they spawned again

4701
08:25:03,400 --> 08:25:31,450
I thought you died right there as I go shit. Oh my goodness. Where's the edge?

4702
08:25:32,090 --> 08:25:36,830
What does he will he stop doing this move?

4703
08:25:48,619 --> 08:25:50,700
Oh my god, it's hurting us

4704
08:25:50,700 --> 08:25:52,700
Yeah, it also sucks you

4705
08:26:04,090 --> 08:26:06,380
All right, that's it

4706
08:26:06,380 --> 08:26:09,360
What we didn't kill?

4707
08:26:09,360 --> 08:26:12,090
What is he doing?

4708
08:26:12,090 --> 08:26:14,090
Okay, we're good

4709
08:26:17,240 --> 08:26:23,560
Memory stone and a golden seed. I got a sacred tear. Thank goodness jealous. I'm jealous

4710
08:26:24,200 --> 08:26:31,159
Hey, i'm leaving the stream open because i'm going to bed, but please don't scream or growl or anything

4711
08:26:31,159 --> 08:26:35,259
I'm not gonna I was just earlier. I was just joking around about it

4712
08:26:38,700 --> 08:26:40,540
Okay, that's good

4713
08:26:40,540 --> 08:26:46,939
Can we go back to um

4714
08:26:46,939 --> 08:26:50,939
Blacksmith so I can upgrade because I think I need do I have the amount of stones I need?

4715
08:26:52,349 --> 08:26:54,560
You were missing a five

4716
08:26:54,560 --> 08:26:55,439
Yeah

4717
08:26:55,439 --> 08:26:57,439
No, I need a five still

4718
08:26:57,919 --> 08:27:01,180
I wonder if anybody sells them

4719
08:27:01,180 --> 08:27:04,779
Left side of this island. We haven't even gotten to I know there's a bunch of

4720
08:27:05,419 --> 08:27:08,860
Catacombs urd tree and all the shit out there. It's just always annoying because there's like one bridge

4721
08:27:09,500 --> 08:27:11,500
But we can go up to

4722
08:27:11,659 --> 08:27:13,819
Castlemore and rampart and go west

4723
08:27:16,720 --> 08:27:19,500
um

4724
08:27:19,500 --> 08:27:22,240
I'm

4725
08:27:22,240 --> 08:27:26,590
We also haven't we haven't done any of the urd trees. Yeah, that's what I mean

4726
08:27:27,229 --> 08:27:29,229
Yeah, so there's a lot of shit we haven't done

4727
08:27:30,040 --> 08:27:35,400
Instead we're in fucking ray lucario fighting placidusax. Let's do the urd tree over here. Let's see what you said

4728
08:27:42,240 --> 08:27:46,860
And then are you how are you feeling are you all right? I feel like I should probably honestly I was up

4729
08:27:47,259 --> 08:27:51,740
Until five a.m. Last night. So like i'm i'm a little bit goofed

4730
08:27:52,459 --> 08:27:55,770
um

4731
08:27:55,770 --> 08:27:59,450
I do I do have to however wake up and go to the gym tomorrow

4732
08:28:01,209 --> 08:28:02,409
um

4733
08:28:02,409 --> 08:28:04,409
But like who cares?

4734
08:28:04,889 --> 08:28:06,270
Am I right?

4735
08:28:06,270 --> 08:28:13,900
I mean am I right we can always just like I don't take a day take a day or two and come back on like monday

4736
08:28:13,900 --> 08:28:16,319
Or it's a tuesday or something

4737
08:28:16,319 --> 08:28:17,840
And I thought we're gonna play tomorrow

4738
08:28:17,840 --> 08:28:20,080
Yeah, but if it's like you're up too late and you want to go to the gym and stuff

4739
08:28:20,959 --> 08:28:24,959
I like have to go early no matter what. Oh, it's not it's not a it's not a whole thing. Okay

4740
08:28:29,659 --> 08:28:32,380
I rescheduled the gymming already

4741
08:28:38,909 --> 08:28:40,909
Uh, I definitely want to eat food though

4742
08:28:41,389 --> 08:28:47,630
So whatever like a boss or two. Yeah, I don't know set like a milestone and then we'll stop and we can play tomorrow

4743
08:28:47,709 --> 08:28:49,310
Let's fight a boss

4744
08:28:49,310 --> 08:28:51,439
get some

4745
08:28:51,439 --> 08:28:53,279
You know ruins

4746
08:28:53,279 --> 08:28:56,959
Because it has been eight and a half hours and i'm hungry. This is uh

4747
08:28:57,520 --> 08:29:00,880
The demi god, I don't know if you count that is that does this count? Yeah

4748
08:29:02,349 --> 08:29:03,549
this counts

4749
08:29:03,549 --> 08:29:20,990
What time do you want to start tomorrow?

4750
08:29:20,990 --> 08:29:22,669
What is this counts?

4751
08:29:22,669 --> 08:29:25,310
Um, are you sure it's kind of like five bosses in here

4752
08:29:25,869 --> 08:29:28,220
No, man

4753
08:29:28,220 --> 08:29:36,240
Actually, I guess because bosses can I was thinking that it would be an actual a boss but it doesn't necessarily have to be a boss

4754
08:29:36,720 --> 08:29:40,639
All right, the the it's the bear. Yeah, the rune bear is a boss shit down

4755
08:29:42,459 --> 08:29:45,180
Is it I think the rune bear is technically a boss, right?

4756
08:29:47,549 --> 08:29:51,069
I didn't think so

4757
08:29:51,069 --> 08:29:55,240
That's i'm a human. I'm playing with you. I was trying to hit you

4758
08:29:59,919 --> 08:30:02,970
Okay, what's the deal?

4759
08:30:02,970 --> 08:30:04,970
It's a little weirdo following you

4760
08:30:07,610 --> 08:30:09,209
pops barrier

4761
08:30:09,209 --> 08:30:15,580
Thanks, pop

4762
08:30:15,580 --> 08:30:17,500
This one doesn't count germa

4763
08:30:17,500 --> 08:30:19,500
All right, fine. There's not even a fog gate

4764
08:30:25,560 --> 08:30:27,319
It's patchwork a boss

4765
08:30:27,319 --> 08:30:31,599
Does that count?

4766
08:30:31,599 --> 08:30:33,419
I mean

4767
08:30:33,419 --> 08:30:37,840
Now isn't there a way to go down here though?

4768
08:30:40,799 --> 08:30:44,000
Yeah, no, there's like a chest but it's in a weird like hidden spot

4769
08:30:46,490 --> 08:30:48,490
There's actually wait, hold on

4770
08:30:50,729 --> 08:30:54,569
There's like we're surrounded by caves right now there's like a lot we can do

4771
08:30:57,080 --> 08:30:58,380
not

4772
08:30:58,380 --> 08:31:01,130
There's a cave up here

4773
08:31:01,209 --> 08:31:03,209
time zones, uh pacific

4774
08:31:03,290 --> 08:31:12,569
That's probably really late for a lot of you guys

4775
08:31:13,740 --> 08:31:18,299
I was back down probably really late for you. What time is it for you red? It's late for you, isn't it? Um

4776
08:31:19,790 --> 08:31:24,909
Holy shit, it's late. That's what i'm saying. That's what i've been trying to say dude

4777
08:31:25,470 --> 08:31:29,689
You won't just pull the plug now and just come back. No, there's one there's a cave around here, dude

4778
08:31:29,689 --> 08:31:30,729
I know it

4779
08:31:30,729 --> 08:31:32,810
You're gonna miss your gym appointment

4780
08:31:33,689 --> 08:31:35,689
I'm not I was gonna be up late anyway

4781
08:31:36,409 --> 08:31:37,369
Okay

4782
08:31:37,369 --> 08:31:41,759
When you get up really groggy tomorrow and you don't get like a good pump on

4783
08:31:42,720 --> 08:31:46,479
You're gonna remember that's fine. I wasn't gonna get a good one anyway

4784
08:31:47,200 --> 08:31:57,720
Why not? I don't know. Uh, I gotta fight a boss. I have to fight a boss dude

4785
08:31:59,819 --> 08:32:01,819
Where the hell are the caves around here?

4786
08:32:02,650 --> 08:32:09,130
I mean, it's hard to look at the map because we can't let's let's jump up the the air beam the air pilot

4787
08:32:09,610 --> 08:32:11,290
Jump up jump

4788
08:32:11,290 --> 08:32:21,080
Okay across the bridge

4789
08:32:30,040 --> 08:32:32,599

4790
08:32:32,599 --> 08:32:34,279
No other way

4791

Shush. I know where i'm going. I know where I am now. We're right next to one somebody said

4794
08:32:55,389 --> 08:32:59,770
Do you really know where you're going? I know where i'm going. I'm not just trolling you

4795
08:33:11,599 --> 08:33:15,200
Get the church waypoint and then you go like down the hill and there's a swampy ass

4796
08:33:28,189 --> 08:33:30,750
Oh my god, I got another sacred tier

4797
08:33:31,770 --> 08:33:34,919
That's huge

4798
08:33:34,919 --> 08:33:38,060
I got a kukri

4799
08:33:38,990 --> 08:33:41,069
My flask actually now will be pretty good. I think

4800
08:33:41,709 --> 08:33:50,759
It's been a little while. That's cool. I should hold on. Can I level up 13? Hold on

4801
08:33:58,169 --> 08:33:59,930

4802
08:33:59,930 --> 08:34:07,450
What the hell are you asking me?

What is i'm asking you on a date to go to this fucking like we have to it's late

4804
08:34:12,090 --> 08:34:14,090
But I have we have to kill a boss first

4805
08:34:15,520 --> 08:34:18,880
Like do an encounter we have to do an encounter. Let's go straight up to the urn tree

4806
08:34:19,520 --> 08:34:22,750
Okay

4807
08:34:22,750 --> 08:34:28,299
That was the goal from the beginning

4808
08:34:28,299 --> 08:34:30,299
Yeah, well, uh, we'll be back tomorrow

4809
08:34:30,540 --> 08:34:36,040
So I did I did you say a time tomorrow? I don't remember. Was it same time or later?

4810
08:34:36,680 --> 08:34:38,840

4811
08:34:39,400 --> 08:34:43,180
So you want to start early message me?

4812
08:34:44,279 --> 08:34:46,919
Uh, no, I mean like same time you said like one year time

4813
08:34:47,560 --> 08:34:49,400
Hey, look what boss it is

4814
08:34:49,400 --> 08:34:57,500
That's pretty fitting get to fight another one. What is the odds of this actually happening?

4815
08:34:58,959 --> 08:35:00,959
What is the odds of this shit?

4816
08:35:02,169 --> 08:35:06,009
What's this weird seed?

4817
08:35:06,009 --> 08:35:14,939
another magma worm

4818
08:35:14,939 --> 08:35:17,180
Yeah, i'm just gonna stay on the horse horse. Yeah

4819
08:35:32,590 --> 08:35:44,509
Okay, this one does a super spin this one actually has a lot of health

4820
08:35:53,950 --> 08:35:55,950
What this motherfucker jumps

4821
08:35:58,000 --> 08:36:00,000
Yeah, where is this guy normally found?

4822
08:36:00,560 --> 08:36:02,799
Yo dorix. I've never heard of this guy

4823
08:36:03,439 --> 08:36:06,220
Theodorix

4824
08:36:06,220 --> 08:36:09,500
Is he the one that's all the way in the ice area all the way in that one corner?

4825
08:36:12,830 --> 08:36:15,520
He's in the volcano

4826
08:36:15,520 --> 08:36:19,759
So I can't imagine the volcano. Oh spinning around like that. I think he is in the volcano

4827
08:36:31,689 --> 08:36:33,689
I haven't been able to get over near him

4828
08:36:54,119 --> 08:36:56,119
He also has phase two

4829
08:36:59,680 --> 08:37:07,919
Done still like a fucking monster hunter like we're just like hunt the same monster all stream

4830
08:37:09,919 --> 08:37:15,119
Oh, I come on dude, like i'm so close to my like dragon plate armor. We're doing like one more magma worm

4831
08:37:21,279 --> 08:37:26,729
All right. Nice

4832
08:37:26,729 --> 08:37:28,729
Only 3,600 but whatever

4833
08:37:29,919 --> 08:37:32,400
Letter to patches and ronin's armor

4834
08:37:34,990 --> 08:37:38,990
Okay, let's teleport back to the church. I want to see one thing and then it's done

4835
08:37:39,549 --> 08:37:41,659
the church

4836
08:37:41,659 --> 08:37:44,299
Yeah, that we just came from church of pilgrimage right above us

4837
08:37:48,700 --> 08:37:50,080
All right

4838
08:37:50,080 --> 08:37:51,520
so we'll do

4839
08:37:51,520 --> 08:37:53,520
What one o'clock two two o'clock tomorrow pacific?

4840
08:37:54,240 --> 08:37:55,919
One or two i'll be around just message me

4841
08:37:56,000 --> 08:37:59,520
I don't know if you want to make like a solid schedule so people know but like well

4842
08:37:59,520 --> 08:38:02,880
We don't we're not gonna we're not gonna run into the technical bullshit. So let's start at one

4843
08:38:03,900 --> 08:38:05,900
Okay, I will be back probably by

4844
08:38:06,459 --> 08:38:11,630
Let me think i'll be back two hours before that. That's fine

4845
08:38:16,840 --> 08:38:19,240
Yeah, I um

4846
08:38:19,240 --> 08:38:22,680
Yeah, we started one that we can it won't be too late if we go a long time

4847
08:38:27,549 --> 08:38:30,090
Cool

4848
08:38:30,090 --> 08:38:33,290
I forgot how you use the cookbooks was the thing I wanted to look at

4849
08:38:33,849 --> 08:38:37,770
I thought you did that at I think I think you just have them now

4850
08:38:38,799 --> 08:38:40,799
If you because it's crafting shit

4851
08:38:40,959 --> 08:38:46,319
So we never got the crafting thing to do any crafting. Oh, yeah, you need an item to craft. Yeah

4852
08:38:47,040 --> 08:38:51,360
Okay. Well, yeah, because I think the crafting things that you craft are also randomized

4853
08:38:51,360 --> 08:38:58,680
You would like spend a whole bunch of weird stuff to get weird thing and i've got a lot of weird stuff

4854
08:38:59,159 --> 08:39:04,439
Anyway, yeah, that was good. Good fun. Good night. I think we'll I mean, I don't know if we'll beat it tomorrow

4855
08:39:04,439 --> 08:39:12,830
But I think we'll probably get the least past very lucaria and it threw um, we made some pretty good progress

4856
08:39:12,830 --> 08:39:18,240
Look at we look at how long look at this. We did pretty good. I banish you

4857
08:39:25,259 --> 08:39:26,540
Yeah, we'll start at one

4858
08:39:26,540 --> 08:39:33,130
The hardest part is always an elden ring like gearing up in the beginning. Well, I mean randomizer doesn't make it any easier

4859
08:39:33,900 --> 08:39:37,340
Yeah, I mean there's like the tricks you could do where you go kill the giant dragon and you know

4860
08:39:37,340 --> 08:39:43,610
Wow, I got all those souls and everyone like claps. Yeah, I'd rather that i'd rather just suck

4861
08:39:44,090 --> 08:39:46,090
absolute asshole at the game and

4862
08:39:46,970 --> 08:39:52,439
Mess up two or three builds in a row and I think it's more fun that way. That's what i'm saying

4863
08:39:52,520 --> 08:40:00,080
Anyway, i'll see you i'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Bye stir. Bye and

4864
08:40:00,639 --> 08:40:07,200
Goodbye to all of you kind of a meaty one today. I don't know if we're gonna do

4865
08:40:08,860 --> 08:40:13,500
A I can't tell you this is gonna be a nine-hour stream tomorrow, but we'll play it

4866
08:40:13,500 --> 08:40:19,419
We'll go for a little while as long as we can. Thanks for watching everybody. We'll see you tomorrow

4867
08:40:19,659 --> 08:40:24,400
I'm very very hungry and i'm very tired. I'm kind of kind of uh

4868
08:40:24,959 --> 08:40:32,279
Zonked out right now, but that was a lot of fun. I was scared that it wasn't gonna work that well

4869
08:40:34,779 --> 08:40:52,720
But it actually works very very well. Appreciate you hanging out very very late for a lot of you. I am going to

4870
08:40:54,540 --> 08:41:02,090
Eat food and go right to bed

4871
08:41:02,090 --> 08:41:02,330
All right

4872
08:41:02,330 --> 08:41:08,200
First order of business tomorrow when the stream starts is I have to do I need to find a smithing stone five

4873
08:41:09,689 --> 08:41:23,610
And I gotta put points into intelligence. That's what we're doing. You needed a typing test. Oh, that's right

4874
08:41:24,009 --> 08:41:33,259
I'll bring it up tomorrow to him. Elden Ring is always a blast even though it's kind of a frustrating mess sometimes

4875
08:41:33,259 --> 08:41:36,200
But it's always fun

4876
08:41:36,200 --> 08:41:40,840
There was two or three potential growl attempts and I stopped them and you saw my face

4877
08:41:40,840 --> 08:41:56,970
I looked over and I put a stop to it. Nah, I'll uh, i'll see you tomorrow. Good night everybody. Take care of yourselves drink a

4878
08:41:58,090 --> 08:42:07,279
I can't even talk. It's just a glass of water. Call your mother. You know the deal. See you guys later
