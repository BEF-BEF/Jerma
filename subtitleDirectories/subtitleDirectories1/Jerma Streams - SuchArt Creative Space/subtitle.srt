1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:09,220
Too many of you guys bet on this sure thing and it works until it doesn't.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,279
There were millions of channel points that said I would not be live

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:20,679
in the next 15 minutes. That was about seven minutes ago.

4
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:28,809
I know that 98% of the time that's accurate, but not this time.

5
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,869
Kind of pay it out. Big payday.

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,619
6.1 million goes to MeowMix and 341 other people.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,719
Nice job. Make sure I tweet this out.

8
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:02,009
Hi guys, welcome to a late night edition of the live stream.

9
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:08,359
We're going to play a chill game today, but I know I say that every time.

10
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,560
And it ends up not being that.

11
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,019
Well, it's a late night version of the stream.

12
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,629
We're going to play, I saw it pop up the other day, or today to be more specific,

13
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:20,790
Such Art Creative Space.

14
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,450
This is going to be a painting stream.

15
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,370
I'm going to paint pictures.

16
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,609
You can get commissions.

17
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,370
You can sell your paintings and shit.

18
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,069
It looks really fun.

19
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,590
This is not the full game though.

20
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,120
I think the full game comes out in like a month or two.

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,120
This is a free starter edition of the game, I guess.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,519
I don't know.

23
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,790
It looks like there's a lot of content there for it being just a random starter edition.

24
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,379
It's kind of like a demo, but it's more than a demo.

25
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,819
EA. This is not an EA game.

26
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,019
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,180
You already played this game.

28
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,659
I did not.

29
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,560
I played a passive, passive pout, passive pout, the artist game.

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,650
This one's different.

31
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,629
I think this one's a little more involved than that one is.

32
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,669
What was it called?

33
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:19,289
Passpart, passpartout, passpartout.

34
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,330
No, not pat upon.

35
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:23,930
Passpartout.

36
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:25,129
Right.

37
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:31,110
There it is.

38
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,389
CVD brain.

39
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:33,750
No, not tonight.

40
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,990
I don't know what happened two, three nights ago, man.

41
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,710
I have no idea.

42
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,610
I walked in a circle in the third Hitman level.

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,289
25 straight minutes and just was yelling at myself.

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,580
Didn't I talk shit about parking garages?

45
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,520
I don't know what happened.

46
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,599
Everything was going so well.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,039
And then I just started talking shit about parking garages.

48
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,120
And I walked in a circle for 20 minutes and I turned the stream on.

49
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,659
What the fuck happened?

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000
He fucking hates concrete.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,719
Yeah, I was talking about how concrete sucks and stuff.

52
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,199
I don't know.

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:20,469
Well, we'll just pretend that last 20 minutes of the last stream didn't happen.

54
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,939
You're not supposed to drink the bong water.

55
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Well, you're not supposed to tell me how to live my life.

56
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,210
Hey, thank you.

57
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,129
Unionize your workplace with the 10 community subs.

58
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:31,610
Appreciate it.

59
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,210
Thank you.

60
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,800
This game has Twitch integration and I think it's on,

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
but I don't have any idea what it is.

62
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,900
So it's on right now, but I don't know what that means.

63
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,060
I guess we'll find out.

64
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,520
EasyCache and InkCat.

65
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,319
Thanks for the subs, too.

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,280
10 from EasyCache and 5 from InkCat.

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,759
Thanks, guys.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,759
What are your opinions on cheese?

69
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:04,490
I love cheese.

70
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,729
That stuff's awesome.

71
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,729
Dogchompers.

72
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,169
Thanks for the 5 community subs.

73
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,540
Gooey.

74
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
It's just ooey gooey cheesy.

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,519
Name 10 cheeses.

76
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:24,920
Brie.

77
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,620
Gouda.

78
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,139
Swiss.

79
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,889
Havarti.

80
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:32,899
American.

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,259
Cheddar.

82
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,389
Gruyere.

83
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,430
Oh, Gruyere.

84
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,629
Three more and I'm done with this.

85
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,759
Jack.

86
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,120
Jack cheese.

87
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,490
Jack.

88
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,170
Two more and I win.

89
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:00,540
Provolone.

90
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,620
And the final one.

91
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:03,980
Feta.

92
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:05,180
Thank you.

93
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,339
Just named 10 cheeses.

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,819
25 community, but this is this 35 community subs are EasyCache.

95
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:14,779
Giving too much money.

96
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,939
Thanks for the 35 community subs.

97
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,139
That's EasyCache.

98
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,939
MintyFox.

99
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:23,740
Thanks for 5 subs.

100
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:25,689
Let's just, what are you?

101
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:26,170
Let's get started.

102
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,490
Let's do it.

103
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:28,410
Jack cheese.

104
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,529
Havarti is not a cheese.

105
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,329
What the hell is it then?

106
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,949
What is Havarti?

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,439
I love Havarti.

108
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,079
Havarti is awesome.

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,579
Havarti is kind of like, it's a cheese that just sort of sits there.

110
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,509
And the flavor of Havarti is sort of just like you,

111
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:54,790
it doesn't even really taste like much, but you know it's cheese.

112
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,990
So you just put it on your sandwich.

113
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,339
It's just like a square that has cheese texture

114
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,180
and it kind of has like a hint of cheese flavor.

115
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,779
Realistically, like Havarti on your sandwich is just like an extra 140 calories.

116
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,699
But I like it though, and it melts really well.

117
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,939
So it's nice melty, ooey, cheesy, gooey.

118
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:16,420
You know what I mean?

119
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,839
You're stalling.

120
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,600
Look, this is a late night stream, all right?

121
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
This is a late night stream.

122
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:27,689
Stalling.

123
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,689
I'm about to paint paintings.

124
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:36,389
All right, that's enough out of you guys.

125
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,220
All right, let's go.

126
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,649
We're going to move on to here.

127
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:42,170
This is, I guess it's turned on.

128
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,980
This is called Such Art Creative Space.

129
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,899
He's stalling.

130
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:52,459
I'm not stalling.

131
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,579
What are you talking about?

132
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:58,279
Okay, I am now.

133
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,800
Like, I'm definitely stalling right now

134
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,839
because I just looked at my phone.

135
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,420
All right, let's go.

136
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,589
There's a story mode.

137
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,029
Let's take a look at what it's going to look like.

138
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,709
Add this to your wish list.

139
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,480
Oh man, I can't wait for this to come out.

140
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,959
A bigger, nicer, well-equipped studio?

141
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,939
Full creative mode?

142
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,139
A virtual gallery?

143
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,000
A story?

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,879
I almost burped.

145
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,040
A full story involving robots, aliens,

146
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,459
and the very fate of the solar system.

147
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,379
What is money if there is no fame?

148
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,379
Let the whole solar system know about you

149
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,060
as you become more famous.

150
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,699
Cool.

151
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,899
All right, so let's go.

152
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:39,860
I'm just going to paint.

153
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,420
How's the audio?

154
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,139
Should we turn it up?

155
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,100
There's music.

156
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:49,589
Is Twitch enabled?

157
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:50,310
You're connected.

158
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,110
Jerma985.

159
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,310
I don't even know what this means.

160
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,959
I guess we'll find out right now.

161
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,879
Here we go.

162
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,920
A, B, C, D, E, B.

163
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,120
What's your artist's name?

164
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,730
How about Jeremy?

165
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,019
Jeremy the Great.

166
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,139
Jerry.

167
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:12,660
Jerry.

168
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,180
I'm your uncle Jerry.

169
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,470
You're my uncle Gary.

170
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,910
I am my uncle Jerry.

171
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:27,639
Jerry.

172
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,240
The year is 2130

173
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,439
and you have just received the result

174
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,600
of your professional compatibility DNA test.

175
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,059
Huh?

176
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,259
Your genome indicates

177
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,740
that you have rare artistic talent.

178
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:45,529
For decades, art has been...

179
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,009
I feel like that would be way too stressful.

180
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,399
That would put a ton of pressure on you

181
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,519
your whole life.

182
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,679
Can you imagine having you be like

183
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,450
50, 12, 13, 14, 15 years old?

184
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,090
It's like, hey, you know,

185
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,009
you have the rare artistic gene.

186
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,009
You should be so good at art.

187
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,289
Are you?

188
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:07,289
And you haven't like explored it yet.

189
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:08,649
That would be so much pressure.

190
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,200
What if you like didn't think

191
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
you did a good enough job?

192
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,789
That would freak me out.

193
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,389
For decades, art has been largely dominated

194
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:22,759
by robots and other artificial intelligence.

195
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,240
But in these times of artistic perfection

196
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,320
and homogeneity,

197
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,639
the world of art has become stale

198
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,889
and in need of renewal.

199
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:34,330
It is time for you to act.

200
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,950
As on earth, the threat of a robot revolt is rising.

201
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,070
What the fuck is going on?

202
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,820
An alien species, the Crabucks,

203
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,159
covet the planet's saltwater.

204
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,600
Only you can decide what to paint

205
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,960
on your next canvas.

206
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,690
What does this have to do with painting?

207
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,360
We're being harvested by aliens?

208
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,419
But so far you have yet to be granted a studio

209
00:09:55,419 --> 00:10:00,779
aboard the International Space City.

210
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,860
In order to get ready to revolutionize the world of art

211
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,700
and while waiting for your real studio,

212
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,460
you have been provided with a virtual space

213
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,860
of artistic simulation.

214
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,620
You activate your hollow headset

215
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,000
and connect to your virtual studio.

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,600
This isn't a VR game, right?

217
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,240
This looks like you're about to go into a VR portion.

218
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,279
Is this VR?

219
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,250
I hope it's not.

220
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,370
I didn't look.

221
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,340
I didn't look.

222
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,700
I didn't even look.

223
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,899
Is it?

224
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,179
Streamer menu.

225
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,919
Oh no, hold on.

226
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:35,559
I don't want to look.

227
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,279
Wait, wait, wait.

228
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,110
Did I lose connection?

229
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,620
Nobody look.

230
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,850
I don't want to spoil anything.

231
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,570
Nobody look.

232
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:51,990
Oh no, a red connection error.

233
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,549
Hold on.

234
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:53,740
All right.

235
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,620
There's no spoilers here.

236
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,899
I thought that might be spoilers.

237
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,659
It kind of is.

238
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,779
There's my-

239
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:02,899
What happened to my cursor?

240
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,129
Okay.

241
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,269
Challenge my skills.

242
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,549
Challenge my style.

243
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:09,429
Boo me.

244
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:11,769
Rate my painting.

245
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:17,269
Have you just completed a painting or a challenge?

246
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:18,230
Time to get booed.

247
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,450
Did that do anything?

248
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:31,509
I don't think the streamer menu works.

249
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:35,139
I have a red connection error.

250
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:38,549
Maybe it's not working right now.

251
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:39,750
Oh well.

252
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,940
Did I just turn it off?

253
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,379
Connect.

254
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,639
You're not connected.

255
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,440
Well, why not?

256
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,740
It doesn't-

257
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,429
You're connected.

258
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:57,909
Oh, shit.

259
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:58,309
Here we go.

260
00:11:58,309 --> 00:11:58,870
All right.

261
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,730
What do you guys think?

262
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,600
Boo me.

263
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,480
Boo or applaud.

264
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,000
Only five of you have voted?

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,840
Is it actually boo?

266
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,000
All right.

267
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,799
This is acting like half the time that I have diarrhea.

268
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,840
I just want to be clear.

269
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,889
Can I stop and poll?

270
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:30,250
All right.

271
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,799
Let's see what you guys say.

272
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,240
This is too long to boo.

273
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,059
Is that too-

274
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,179
Was that gross?

275
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,799
That was kind of gross what I just said, isn't it?

276
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,750
I have zero dollars.

277
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,470
All right.

278
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,029
All right.

279
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:43,669
Let's see.

280
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:49,500
Okay.

281
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,480
Thanks.

282
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,720
Paint.

283
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,490
To paint with a brush you have in hand, press right.

284
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:54,809
Whoa.

285
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,110
Hold on.

286
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,429
Select another object present in your inventory.

287
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:02,200
Use mouse wheel.

288
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,080
Oh, shit.

289
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,639
I shouldn't-

290
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:10,019
This is my house.

291
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,360
Is that a distinct paint on the wall?

292
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,519
All right.

293
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,720
What else do I have?

294
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,600
Oh, shit.

295
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,639
Throw an object.

296
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,440
Press E.

297
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,279
Okay.

298
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,480
This game is going to be fun.

299
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,659
You pick up the object you threw, aim at it, and keep pressing without moving.

300
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:25,539
Ah.

301
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:29,750
Thanks to the wonders of artificial gravity, you can also press space and jump.

302
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,940
Cool.

303
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,740
Press left control to crouch and paint the ugly floor.

304
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:39,049
This is-

305
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,950
It's like a toddler.

306
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,509
Okay.

307
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:43,669
Wait, do we have a canvas?

308
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,720
You don't have any commissions.

309
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,000
After you flush what?

310
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,350
Place a finished painting on the support to send it to a customer.

311
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,230
After you flush a painting down the toilet.

312
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,110
After you finish a small painting, place it here and send it to your client.

313
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,669
Okay.

314
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:01,580
Those are my emails.

315
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:01,820
Hold on.

316
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

317
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:03,899
I'm excited.

318
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:04,460
Hold on.

319
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,259
Was-

320
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:10,980
I have a paint roller?

321
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,320
No, don't fuck this up already.

322
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,879
Press F to do a-

323
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,360
Oh, wait.

324
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,279
I can go like this?

325
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,000
Okay.

326
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,740
So I can go vertical or horizontal.

327
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,799
I just testing.

328
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,720
Holy shit.

329
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,679
There's so many slots.

330
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,720
This is my canvas.

331
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,269
Take a photo.

332
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:36,860
What?

333
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,580
Holy shit.

334
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,299
This is awesome.

335
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:38,940
What is this?

336
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,539
It's like ice cream station.

337
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:44,860
Choose a color and tone to get the paint you want.

338
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:53,799
You can access your photos from the main menu or in-game using the computer.

339
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,759
Oh, cool.

340
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,100
How do I put this down?

341
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,740
Is there a hairdryer?

342
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,519
By the way, why is there a hairdryer?

343
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:17,100
Is this drying the paint?

344
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,340
Okay.

345
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,899
This is so-

346
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:19,179
Why is there a broom too?

347
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:25,879
I'm gonna prime this canvas.

348
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,759
Access your photos.

349
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,080
Cool.

350
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,840
From the main menu.

351
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,159
From the-

352
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,580
Oh, and the computer.

353
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,299
Photos.

354
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:35,019
Whoa!

355
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,440
That's not that exciting.

356
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,320
Whatever.

357
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,519
Emails.

358
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,240
Painting order.

359
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,879
Welcome to your-

360
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,899
Hold on.

361
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,179
Dear Jerry.

362
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,409
Welcome to your virtual art simulation space.

363
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,049
Following the results of your latest DNA test

364
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,860
and a view of your immense artistic potential,

365
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
you've been registered in the Talent Development Program,

366
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,139
a United Earth program.

367
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,860
Until a real studio is assigned to your name,

368
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,980
this simplified virtual studio will allow you to familiarize yourself with all this stuff.

369
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,820
Cool.

370
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,379
All right.

371
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,259
That's all I send back.

372
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,289
Order.

373
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:06,090
What I want?

374
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,690
Something very powerful.

375
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,129
Use a small canvas, please.

376
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:12,230
Would 220 dollars be enough?

377
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,039
I mean powerful.

378
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:14,759
Small canvas.

379
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,559
That's enough?

380
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,120
Sure.

381
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,350
How long do you-

382
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,309
How long do I have?

383
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,039
Okay.

384
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,960
Small canvas or something powerful?

385
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,200
I need a canvas.

386
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,899
All right.

387
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,620
Change canvas.

388
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,340
Small.

389
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,620
Good.

390
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,100
Can I make the FOV bigger?

391
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,929
Where's like FOV?

392
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,620
There's no FOV, is there?

393
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:46,779
No FOV?

394
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:48,899
That's all right.

395
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:49,139
What is it?

396
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,340
It looks like it's 90.

397
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,659
All right.

398
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:51,220
Small canvas.

399
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,460
Here we go.

400
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,500
That's not a small canvas.

401
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,299
This is huge.

402
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:54,019
This is fucking-

403
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,139
He's like an entire wall.

404
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:06,730
And this?

405
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,769
Well, how do I make this small?

406
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,480
After you finish painting,

407
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,920
use the terminal to send it to your client.

408
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,019
Change canvas.

409
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,299
Wait.

410
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:16,779
Smaller.

411
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,359
How do I make a small canvas?

412
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:28,839
Small canvas is already on the wall.

413
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,160
Where?

414
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,079
Oh shit.

415
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:31,559
It's right here.

416
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,069
Oh fuck.

417
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:34,309
Okay.

418
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:34,549
Let's go.

419
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,710
All right.

420
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,619
Something powerful.

421
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:38,660
Okay guys.

422
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,019
Why don't you challenge my style?

423
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:40,980
No.

424
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:42,359
No.

425
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,880
We're not doing any of this right now.

426
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,039
Yeah.

427
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:44,599
Fuck all this.

428
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,400
I'm not doing any of this.

429
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,430
All right.

430
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,309
Something powerful.

431
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,230
All right.

432
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,190
I need paints.

433
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,180
All right.

434
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,220
What should I get?

435
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,420
Raspberry sauce?

436
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,940
Yep.

437
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,819
Give me this.

438
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:57,380
Raspberry?

439
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,099
Wait.

440
00:17:58,099 --> 00:17:58,980
These are spray paints.

441
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,259
What?

442
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:00,819
Oh my God.

443
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:01,700
I love spray paint.

444
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,579
I love spray paint.

445
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:12,660
This is cool.

446
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:19,460
All right.

447
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,099
I love this.

448
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,339
All right.

449
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:20,980
This game is a lot.

450
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,140
Wait.

451
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,019
Is this a sponge too?

452
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,609
You can clean?

453
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:30,089
Uh-oh guys.

454
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,849
I may have found.

455
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,609
Uh-oh.

456
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:36,140
I think I may have found

457
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,140
a game of the year 2021.

458
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,019
It's possible.

459
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,460
Let's not get too excited here.

460
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,059
I don't want to get too excited

461
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:45,940
but I may have found it.

462
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,019
And this shit is just free right now.

463
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,619
This game doesn't cost any money.

464
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,279
The one that costs money

465
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,880
is coming out like in a month or two.

466
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,809
That's a lie.

467
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:55,450
I don't know.

468
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,410
It says coming soon.

469
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,559
Oh, it feels so good.

470
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,890
Okay.

471
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,170
Just get rid of this for a second.

472
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,369
I need to have a station set up.

473
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,210
I want this first.

474
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:11,849
What do I want this for?

475
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:12,730
I'm going to dump paint on this

476
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,690
and spray paint it.

477
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:13,849
Yeah.

478
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:14,089
Hold on.

479
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:14,410
Wait.

480
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:14,730
Powerful.

481
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:14,970
Power.

482
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,289
I'll give you.

483
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:15,849
I'll give you power.

484
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:16,329
What does this do?

485
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:19,779
No, no, no, no, no.

486
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:20,259
That's too high.

487
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,660
You can flip it.

488
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,059
Ooh.

489
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,099
You can rotate it.

490
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,099
You can tilt it back.

491
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:28,819
Tilt it forward.

492
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:29,059
All right.

493
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:29,299
Cool.

494
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:29,460
Cool.

495
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:29,700
Cool.

496
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,579
I'm excited.

497
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:31,859
What should I do?

498
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:41,240
How do I spin this?

499
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:51,500
Oh, man.

500
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,220
That's a good start.

501
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,589
Let's get the sculpting tool.

502
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:02,259
What?

503
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:04,980
Dude.

504
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,660
Holy fuck.

505
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,299
This is cool.

506
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,380
Dip it in the blue.

507
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,069
I got to make sure before anything happens.

508
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,109
I got to fucking sign this.

509
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,779
All right.

510
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:21,259
Now let's do...

511
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,539
Give me the brush.

512
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,539
How do I wash this?

513
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,299
Does it combine?

514
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,220
I think it combined.

515
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,500
It is combining.

516
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,619
Dude, this is fucking crazy.

517
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:35,339
It's combining.

518
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:36,619
It's combining the colors.

519
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:48,859
Let's get some red in there.

520
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:54,630
What's this?

521
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,000
Salt?

522
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,779
Oh, it's like a little pounder.

523
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:02,019
Wait.

524
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:02,579
Hold on.

525
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:13,450
What is this thing?

526
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,890
This is like the pitcher's bag.

527
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:20,470
This has got to be powerful.

528
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,910
I did my first painting.

529
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,470
Spread that around.

530
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,069
We'll make it like kind of dusty.

531
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:28,380
I need some green down here.

532
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:36,519
Get a little bit more red.

533
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,559
Layering sucks.

534
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:37,880
It's not...

535
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,680
What do you mean this sucks?

536
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,789
Did you see the title of this frame?

537
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:41,910
This is the background, guys.

538
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,869
This is nothing but a painting.

539
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,869
Plus, this art, you can't say art sucks.

540
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:48,069
Somebody sold a banana for $150,000 taped to the wall.

541
00:21:48,150 --> 00:22:03,509
You can't say that.

542
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:04,470
I just go.

543
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,910
I'm an abstract painter.

544
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,789
What does a spoon do?

545
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,700
Let me try.

546
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,869
Eat the paint.

547
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:21,430
Wait, you can just...

548
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,470
Really?

549
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,950
Hold on.

550
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:25,849
What?

551
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:27,750
I can just like drip it on there?

552
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:28,970
What?

553
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:38,569
I need to hold on.

554
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:39,130
I need to tilt.

555
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:43,339
Throw paint.

556
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,059
Wait, how do I throw it?

557
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:52,250
Hold on a second.

558
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,730
Back up.

559
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,549
Holy shit.

560
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,309
Okay, this looks pretty good so far.

561
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:03,349
All right, we got a background.

562
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:08,170
Let's get this little one up and just be like...

563
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:10,250
What do we do?

564
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,990
Okay, now we're gonna have...

565
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:13,190
Let's see.

566
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,420
I think it's ready.

567
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,220
Is everything is ready?

568
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:22,890
This looks fucking cool.

569
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,930
I squeeze some on there.

570
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,809
All right, let me get the teal.

571
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,980
Dude, can I just squeeze the paint out?

572
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,059
Holy shit, you can.

573
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:32,809
No, you can't.

574
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:42,950
There's nothing left in here.

575
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:47,109
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

576
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:47,829
Where's that other tool?

577
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:48,630
The thing you can spread it with.

578
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:50,150
Wait, should I dust it?

579
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,549
Shit.

580
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:57,029
No, it's okay.

581
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,470
It's a big fist coming out.

582
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,029
Wait, hold on.

583
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:13,430
Actually, I kind of like it.

584
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:24,890
I'm gonna call this one Tornado.

585
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:34,180
I guess with Tasmanian devil in there.

586
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,390
Okay, where's my painting tools?

587
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,589
Why is there Nerf gun in here?

588
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:41,779
Is there stencils?

589
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,880
Are you kidding me?

590
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,400
What?

591
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,539
Okay, I have to give the Tasmanian devil like a Victory Royale.

592
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,960
Okay, hold on.

593
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,359
I need...

594
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,920
Where are my paint brushes?

595
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,960
I throw them on the ground.

596
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:09,240
This isn't doing anything.

597
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,509
Where are my brushes?

598
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:14,630
I kind of like this so far.

599
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,579
What do I do with my brushes?

600
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,400
Where are my paint brushes?

601
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,039
Oh, they're in my inventory.

602
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:28,759
Is this cleaning?

603
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,430
Oh, you clean your tools.

604
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,750
Okay.

605
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,490
Let's test the porridge.

606
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,650
I sprayed this?

607
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,369
Wait.

608
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:43,480
All right, now I'm gonna...

609
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm gonna...

610
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,380
Let's...

611
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,599
I have minus $30 right now for what?

612
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,559
Minus 30 bucks.

613
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,059
What?

614
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,259
Okay, I need this.

615
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,539
I want it to be...

616
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:02,500
Let's have little fine lines just like...

617
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,349
Make them blue.

618
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:11,029
I want it like a teal.

619
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,509
That looks good.

620
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,549
Okay, now let's go like this.

621
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:14,710
The same color?

622
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,269
No.

623
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:19,190
How about punching someone in the face over here?

624
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,720
How do you...

625
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,920
What does the fist look like?

626
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,900
And the thumb is up here, right?

627
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:45,380
Okay.

628
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,299
Is this a sniffing nose?

629
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:48,500
Should it just be a nose?

630
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:52,470
Maybe just like a guy...

631
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,069
Like 3D is nose.

632
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:55,269
Cartoon style is like...

633
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,619
He's like sniffing in something.

634
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,099
Looks like boogers.

635
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,779
Hold on.

636
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:04,579
Wait.

637
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:05,859
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

638
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,779
I think I messed this up.

639
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:08,500
I messed this up.

640
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:39,720
I have to have like eyes back here bugging out.

641
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,920
Like, whoa!

642
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,200
Because it looks 3D.

643
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,730
It's not a snail.

644
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,490
No, it's a big sniff.

645
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:56,359
This is one of the eyes.

646
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:56,759
You know what I mean?

647
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,539
Is there an undo?

648
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:04,740
How do you undo?

649
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,809
Can I do Ctrl Z?

650
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:12,339
No, you can't.

651
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:16,170
Oh, they should be white.

652
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:26,539
Okay, that's better.

653
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,420
Okay, good.

654
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,700
Is this too thick of a brush?

655
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,200
Yes.

656
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,690
Way too thick of a brush.

657
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:36,970
It's paint.

658
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:37,690
You can't undo.

659
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,490
Well, it's a video game.

660
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,049
You should...

661
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:40,009
Yeah, you can.

662
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,150
I can fix it.

663
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,390
Here we go.

664
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:49,670
Ready?

665
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,269
This is so cool.

666
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:59,130
I've been like waiting for a million years for a game like this.

667
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,650
And I know they already exist.

668
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,089
But this one's better.

669
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:06,359
This is a crocodile doing a big sniff.

670
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:11,579
What do eyes like attach?

671
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:12,380
I don't know.

672
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:23,799
It's called painting.

673
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:29,160
Or like what?

674
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,440
Like an elephant?

675
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,740
Or just a guy?

676
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,619
Like a green guy?

677
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:41,859
Should I make like a big mouth here?

678
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:42,500
Like, whoa!

679
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:57,319
What do eyes look like?

680
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,720
Like this?

681
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,279
This is a hair.

682
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,079
That can stick.

683
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Okay, now we need like a mouth going like, what?

684
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,500
I need teal, right?

685
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,039
A little bit, a little bit more.

686
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:24,579
That's it, right?

687
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:24,980
Yeah.

688
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,180
Wait, did I accidentally touch the purple?

689
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,259
Is this the same color?

690
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:35,059
No, it's not.

691
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,019
Old and brash.

692
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,460
Make a pog crocodile.

693
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,019
All right.

694
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:43,980
There it is.

695
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,319
That's the right one, right?

696
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:52,099
I can't tell if it's the same color.

697
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:53,779
Okay, he has to be like, whoa!

698
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:56,059
I can't mess this up.

699
00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:13,509
I can...

700
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:14,309
No, it's not ruined.

701
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:22,579
It's not ruined.

702
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:22,900
It's fine.

703
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,299
It's fine.

704
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:29,799
Is this the right color?

705
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:41,430
Not the right color.

706
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,519
Wrong color.

707
00:31:42,519 --> 00:32:05,079
I need to undo button.

708
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:05,640
Fuck!

709
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,440
No!

710
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:06,920
It's okay.

711
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:11,579
You can't.

712
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:11,900
I know.

713
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,380
You...

714
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:13,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

715
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,460
I can fix it.

716
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,769
I think.

717
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:16,329
I can fix it.

718
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:16,809
Hold on.

719
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,430
This one has the right paint on it.

720
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,420
This one does, right?

721
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:22,980
No, it doesn't.

722
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,339
How do I get that fucking color?

723
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:32,019
How did I get this color?

724
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:38,519
It's that color.

725
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,160
It's that one.

726
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:49,269
Wait, hold on.

727
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:49,670
No!

728
00:32:49,670 --> 00:33:02,730
What the...

729
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,690
Get the gun?

730
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:16,339
There's nothing in here.

731
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:17,140
Holy shit.

732
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,779
Are you kidding me?

733
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:22,650
I want this.

734
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,289
Somebody wants this.

735
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:23,930
Somebody wants this.

736
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,490
Somebody wants this.

737
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:24,970
Somebody wants this.

738
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:25,450
Somebody wants this.

739
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,089
I don't care about anything.

740
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:27,240
Who wants it?

741
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,119
I want this.

742
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,690
I like the power of your paintings.

743
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,890
I think you have great potential.

744
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,849
Here's what I'd like you to paint.

745
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:35,289
Abundance in a gothic style would be great.

746
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:35,609
Then...

747
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:35,849
All right.

748
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:36,569
Take it.

749
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:38,089
Take it.

750
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:39,049
He wants this.

751
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:40,170
He wants this one.

752
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,279
Give it to me.

753
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,890
Send this painting to Jay's.

754
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,380
Take it.

755
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:48,859
Send the painting.

756
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:49,740
Your painting will be sent to the customer.

757
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,019
There's no virtual gallery in this training program.

758
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:52,299
Consider taking a photo.

759
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:52,940
Take it.

760
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,329
He said, I want this.

761
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:59,910
I got a text saying, I want this.

762
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:05,259
Okay.

763
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:07,269
Did I do it?

764
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:08,230
Did I get the money?

765
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:20,300
It's not done yet, but what do you think about it so far?

766
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:28,539
Oh, come on.

767
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,780
I have to fix it first.

768
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,659
That's way too many.

769
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,420
I'm not counting any zeros or any tens.

770
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:38,980
Thank you for the 80 bucks.

771
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,619
You guys thought he did...

772
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,460
He said he gave me an email that he wants this.

773
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,019
How do we...

774
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,539
Does he have like binoculars in my house?

775
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:46,260
Is he like over here looking through my window?

776
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:57,269
What is it?

777
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,550
Did they take the average or just the...

778
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,110
That's fair.

779
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,030
That is actually kind of fair.

780
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,230
Oh, I'll take it.

781
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:08,789
That's fair.

782
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:11,750
Four, five, fucking three.

783
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,389
What is this?

784
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,800
Is this like a soft serve ice cream machine?

785
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,610
Oh, shit.

786
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,250
Soft serve.

787
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:25,219
Oh, whoa.

788
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,289
It's kind of sour.

789
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:29,690
I don't taste any vanilla.

790
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,320
The credit card?

791
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,059
What is this?

792
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:42,010
What color is this?

793
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,739
Oh, my God.

794
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:44,139
I got it.

795
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:44,460
All right.

796
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:50,579
I got the color reader.

797
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:50,820
Okay.

798
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,860
Now give me that color.

799
00:35:52,420 --> 00:36:10,570
Now what do I do?

800
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,530
Oh, I did it already.

801
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:12,969
Oh, no.

802
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:13,530
Fuck you.

803
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,010
Do it again.

804
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:14,570
Give me another one.

805
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:23,940
No.

806
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,900
Put it in.

807
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,539
Stop it.

808
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,929
What's the range on this?

809
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:28,969
All right.

810
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:29,929
It's pretty fucking far.

811
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:41,780
Nice.

812
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,019
Yes.

813
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:45,780
Finally, I have the right color.

814
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:52,460
I need new water.

815
00:36:52,460 --> 00:37:03,300
Okay.

816
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,179
Where do I get water?

817
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:09,099
Where's the water?

818
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:19,340
Place to finish painting on the support.

819
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,699
I don't even need to do that.

820
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:23,659
Canvas printer.

821
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:24,460
Oh, shit.

822
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,329
That's cool.

823
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,369
What do I get water?

824
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:34,599
What if I need a lot more of that?

825
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,369
Does this cost money?

826
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:40,090
I feel like I'm going to need a lot of this paint

827
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,289
because I'm going to make a couple.

828
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:41,849
I like this teal.

829
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:42,889
Take my favorite color.

830
00:37:42,889 --> 00:38:07,030
Teal addict.

831
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,909
I like teal.

832
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:09,510
I love teal.

833
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:16,139
I need water.

834
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:17,099
I have another bucket.

835
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:17,820
I have two buckets.

836
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,460
I'm fine.

837
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,760
Trust me when I say that I will use this.

838
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
This is going to be used in every single painting, guys.

839
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,900
This is a bucket filler.

840
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:38,969
If it isn't that, this is water.

841
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:46,070
How do I put it down?

842
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,269
Put it down the drain.

843
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,230
This shit's stuck there forever.

844
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,579
Why is this water so cloudy?

845
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:54,099
This is cloudy ass water.

846
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:54,579
Look at this.

847
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,050
This is the cloudiest water I've ever seen.

848
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,849
This is water.

849
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:05,769
We'll pick the damn thing up.

850
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,949
Okay.

851
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,940
This is just permanently going to be teal.

852
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:13,980
It's paint thinner.

853
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,909
Where's the paint bucket filler that you got?

854
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,369
Oh, dude.

855
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:25,849
There it is.

856
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,119
Cotton candy ice cream.

857
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,840
Let me leave my mouth under it.

858
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,070
Cotton candy.

859
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:43,929
Fill it.

860
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:47,420
Fill the bucket.

861
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:47,900
What are you doing?

862
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:04,869
Nice.

863
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,250
I just fucking throw it over there.

864
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,969
All right.

865
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,489
How do I put this down without dumping it?

866
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,019
I don't know.

867
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:13,900
How do you put it down?

868
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:17,619
Okay.

869
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:18,900
So I have the right color now.

870
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,300
I'm ready.

871
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,389
I'm taking my paintbrush.

872
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:23,670
I'm going to wait.

873
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,230
I need water.

874
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:25,610
Give me this.

875
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:28,099
You're fucking crazy, dude.

876
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:28,420
What are you?

877
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:28,659
Why?

878
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:43,900
This is an art studio.

879
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,849
I don't understand.

880
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:46,809
This is an art studio.

881
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,840
Go find me an art studio that doesn't have paint

882
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,050
all over every fucking wall and all over the ground.

883
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:55,210
All right.

884
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:55,929
Here we go.

885
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:58,260
I don't want to use this.

886
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,579
I want my finesse.

887
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,289
Where's my finesse brush?

888
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:05,980
What happened to it?

889
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,730
Where's my finesse brush?

890
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,079
What did I throw?

891
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:22,550
I just had it on the floor.

892
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,710
Yeah.

893
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:22,949
Where?

894
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:23,349
Where is it?

895
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:28,599
Left.

896
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,239
Left.

897
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:29,480
Where?

898
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:33,929
How did I get over here?

899
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:36,599
Okay.

900
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:36,920
Rinse.

901
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,340
Here we go.

902
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,780
Time to go.

903
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,260
Let's do it.

904
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,099
Let's touch this up a little.

905
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:48,730
Thank you.

906
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,449
All right.

907
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:53,539
This is not the right color.

908
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:53,780
How?

909
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,739
Is this the wrong color?

910
00:41:54,739 --> 00:42:01,480
How is this the wrong color?

911
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:17,239
Is it dry?

912
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:22,980
Is that what it is?

913
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,860
It's a work in progress.

914
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,500
Just wait.

915
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:37,690
It's not drying.

916
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,210
You guys fucking annihilated.

917
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,949
I'm not.

918
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:46,650
Okay.

919
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,650
When it dries, then I have to put

920
00:42:48,650 --> 00:43:13,349
like a big open mouth right here.

921
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:14,070
D face.

922
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:21,590
I mean, it's kind of, but this is happy.

923
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:33,190
Dude, I'm an artist.

924
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:43,480
Turn off the music.

925
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,500
Kind of is the same loop, isn't it?

926
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,110
Need more paint.

927
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,380
Wrong one.

928
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,179
Put on an OST.

929
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:55,739
I kind of don't want to nuke this VOD though.

930
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:57,500
Doesn't that happen every time you do OSTs?

931
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:11,940
Okay.

932
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,420
This is actually, this is starting to be.

933
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,780
I got to make sure this doesn't turn into like

934
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,909
a like big green penis.

935
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,110
I'm trying.

936
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,869
It'll just wait till it's done.

937
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,019
Hold off your reservations here.

938
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:32,360
Those are clean lines.

939
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:34,900
Ah, you guys are relaxed.

940
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,340
I am so relaxed.

941
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:40,230
Okay.

942
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,710
There it is.

943
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,070
He's like, whoa.

944
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:46,789
Okay.

945
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:49,429
Um, now we need teeth.

946
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:52,150
He's got like teeth and a big tongue.

947
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,579
I need white.

948
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:22,280
Well, I'll get teeth as he has.

949
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,000
Too much?

950
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,679
Too much?

951
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,239
No, that's all right.

952
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:57,349
It's orange.

953
00:45:57,349 --> 00:45:58,070
Wrong.

954
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:10,280
This is like fucked up.

955
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:22,019
Okay.

956
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:24,969
He's, uh, this is just like, this looks

957
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:26,010
really fucking wrong.

958
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:31,190
He's like boogers into his own mouth.

959
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,150
Is that what is happening?

960
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:33,829
Get the vote menu.

961
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:35,110
No, it's not done yet.

962
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,389
I'm not taking the menu up.

963
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,969
I need to see what it looks like.

964
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:51,900
And then I got to change it.

965
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,420
Well, they wanted something powerful.

966
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,460
They're going to get it.

967
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,949
And by the way, I'm sorry.

968
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,710
You don't just commission somebody like

969
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:03,110
a famous artist like me.

970
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,710
Hey, uh, do whatever you want.

971
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,900
Just make sure it's powerful.

972
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,659
You have to be ready for anything.

973
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,719
You might get, you might get human shit in the mail.

974
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,539
Be careful with what you ask for here.

975
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:21,340
Be, you got to be very clear.

976
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,059
I want it, uh, I want it powerful.

977
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:27,139
But, um, use paint and make it look like

978
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,179
I could show it to my grandmother.

979
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:28,500
There you go.

980
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,860
Powerful, but grandmother.

981
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:34,059
Okay.

982
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:41,750
Tongues have like a line, right?

983
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:44,329
Do tongues have like a line down the middle?

984
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,690
This looks like it could be,

985
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,360
I like on the commercial for like an old

986
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,719
soft drink in the 90s or something.

987
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:04,329
In fact, I get an order for you.

988
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:05,050
Hold on.

989
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,409
I think there's like a Nickelodeon ad

990
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:07,769
with this exact thing is happening.

991
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,099
Some of you guys forget this.

992
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,460
Nickelodeon used to be about like eating boogers

993
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,460
and like pooping and shitting your pants and stuff.

994
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:23,929
Nickelodeon from like the late 80s into the mid 90s

995
00:48:23,929 --> 00:48:25,849
was about like boogers all over your face

996
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:28,010
and like boogies and boogers.

997
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,329
It was every single thing they did.

998
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:35,159
All right.

999
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:36,199
I'm selling this one.

1000
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:38,579
This one's ready.

1001
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:39,719
Let's start over.

1002
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:46,380
No, it isn't.

1003
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,340
Yes, it was.

1004
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,369
Actually, this would go on the grid on the bottom

1005
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:52,010
of a skateboard.

1006
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:52,489
Don't you think?

1007
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,500
Let's get a picture of this.

1008
00:48:55,139 --> 00:49:01,940
Why am I trying to paint the lens?

1009
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,739
Like that's stupid.

1010
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,119
All right.

1011
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:04,840
This one's completed.

1012
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,719
I'm going to call this one

1013
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,400
a skateboard t-shirt

1014
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,460
ponyhawk menu t-shirt menu.

1015
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,579
Create a character t-shirt number like 32.

1016
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,650
That's what I'm calling it.

1017
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:30,920
Okay.

1018
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,179
This is for Solman.

1019
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,059
Solman.

1020
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:35,539
Here you go.

1021
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,260
Let me know what you think.

1022
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,940
How do I send it to you?

1023
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,559
How do I pick it up?

1024
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:48,980
It's okay.

1025
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,539
It was dry.

1026
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:50,179
It was dry.

1027
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,360
Paint side down.

1028
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,889
Okay, Solman.

1029
00:49:58,889 --> 00:49:59,769
Hope you like it.

1030
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:02,969
Let me know what you guys think.

1031
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:03,849
Finish painting.

1032
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:05,210
Rate my painting.

1033
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,050
By the way, 40 seconds is way too long.

1034
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,329
You have like 15 seconds.

1035
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:09,130
Come on.

1036
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,949
What do you think?

1037
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:21,179
Okay.

1038
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:22,780
Okay.

1039
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,619
6.5 out of 10.

1040
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:28,179
That's not bad.

1041
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,289
That's pretty good, actually.

1042
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:32,010
I'm happy with that.

1043
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:32,809
6.5 out of 10.

1044
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:35,639
That's good.

1045
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,000
I can sell this on a marketplace?

1046
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,159
Wait.

1047
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:37,800
No, I have a commission.

1048
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:38,760
Hold on.

1049
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,480
How much are you going to give me?

1050
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:42,679
This is like how much money is this for?

1051
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:43,559
Can I sell it for more?

1052
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,050
I can only do one painting.

1053
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:49,019
220 bucks.

1054
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:50,139
I'm going to get like 500 for this?

1055
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:54,980
Oh, I forgot to sign it.

1056
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,780
I forgot to sign it.

1057
00:50:57,909 --> 00:50:58,550
No, I did sign it.

1058
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,190
I just painted over it.

1059
00:50:59,190 --> 00:50:59,510
Hold on.

1060
00:51:00,389 --> 00:51:01,909
Uh, yeah, I got to sign it.

1061
00:51:01,909 --> 00:51:12,980
Okay.

1062
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,150
I'm not doing my real signature.

1063
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,670
That guy freaks me out.

1064
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,989
I'm not going to sign my actual like real signature

1065
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:21,590
in front of fucking 14,000 people.

1066
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,650
It's kind of sounds dangerous.

1067
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:26,469
Doesn't it?

1068
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:27,590
Hey, I don't know if I'm going to do that.

1069
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,639
All right.

1070
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:32,519
Let's just let's do it.

1071
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:35,460
I want something very powerful.

1072
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:37,130
Small canvas.

1073
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:37,449
Let's go.

1074
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,380
Do you like it?

1075
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:51,610
How is it?

1076
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,210
Make your signature the channel icon.

1077
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,090
I don't think I can do that.

1078
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,760
Into the shredder it goes.

1079
00:51:59,639 --> 00:51:59,880
All right.

1080
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,480
We're going to go wild for the next one.

1081
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,119
I'm talking just I'm going to just do whatever the fuck I want.

1082
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:05,159
I'm not going to think about it.

1083
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:07,539
Did you pay me?

1084
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,429
Target tube.

1085
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:20,460
Where's my money?

1086
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,289
My name is Dumari.

1087
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:26,010
I would like to.

1088
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,849
I would have liked to be an artist myself.

1089
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:28,650
Here's what I'd like you to do.

1090
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:29,610
Something steampunk.

1091
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:32,329
No, that's fucking boring.

1092
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:34,329
My name is Asher.

1093
00:52:34,329 --> 00:52:36,329
I think you can change the world through your artwork.

1094
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:37,449
Can you paint something for me?

1095
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:38,570
A skull.

1096
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,849
The size of the canvas is up to you.

1097
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:40,010
Okay.

1098
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:40,969
I'll do that one.

1099
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:44,010
All right.

1100
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:44,650
I need a big.

1101
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:45,610
I'm going to do a huge skull.

1102
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:46,889
I'm going to paint it with this gun too.

1103
00:52:46,889 --> 00:52:49,369
It's going to be like in red paint like a red blood skull.

1104
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:50,570
There's going to be so much meaning behind it.

1105
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,739
I can't wait.

1106
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:53,219
And I just like.

1107
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:57,210
All right.

1108
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:57,690
Load it up.

1109
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,659
Give me that canvas.

1110
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,139
Change canvas.

1111
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,900
I want a big one.

1112
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:07,019
This one.

1113
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:07,820
One by one free.

1114
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,650
Where's my money for the last commission?

1115
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:14,329
All right.

1116
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:14,889
I'm going to do it.

1117
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:15,050
Wait.

1118
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:15,530
I need a back.

1119
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:16,409
I need a background to be gray.

1120
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,309
Gray background.

1121
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:21,429
There's a roller.

1122
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:33,480
I'm a little tall enough.

1123
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:44,619
Where did my money for the other one go?

1124
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:50,090
Oh, shit.

1125
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:51,050
This whole thing moves.

1126
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,659
I need more paint.

1127
00:53:55,659 --> 00:54:10,699
It's all right if it's a little washed out on the left here.

1128
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:12,219
It's just it's the background.

1129
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:15,909
All right.

1130
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:16,469
Hey, let's go.

1131
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:18,789
Let's go to the McDonald's and let's get every fucking soda.

1132
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:20,550
We got sprite.

1133
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,349
We got Powerade.

1134
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:22,309
We got Powerade blue.

1135
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:24,230
We've got like Mountain Dew.

1136
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,030
Do the whole thing.

1137
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:25,530
Yeah.

1138
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:40,760
There it is.

1139
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:42,760
Oh, yeah.

1140
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,159
Okay.

1141
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:43,559
Oh, yeah.

1142
00:54:58,550 --> 00:54:58,949
They go.

1143
00:54:58,949 --> 00:54:59,670
220 bucks.

1144
00:54:59,670 --> 00:54:59,989
Let's go.

1145
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:06,070
All right.

1146
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,989
That's a pretty good start.

1147
00:55:13,239 --> 00:55:15,449
Not a bad start.

1148
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:15,690
All right.

1149
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:16,010
Let's go.

1150
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:16,809
Give me the gun.

1151
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:18,360
I told you guys this one was going to be.

1152
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,239
I'm just going to go for it.

1153
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,500
All right.

1154
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,539
We got red in here, right?

1155
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:24,860
Okay.

1156
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,659
Fill it up with red.

1157
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,679
There it is.

1158
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:30,230
Let's make this fucking skull.

1159
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:32,980
What does the skull look like?

1160
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,070
It's got like a big head like.

1161
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:55,559
Oh, okay.

1162
00:55:55,559 --> 00:56:00,489
Now I need this might give me that paint brush.

1163
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:08,699
I need white.

1164
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:21,690
I'm a big T like this looks like one of the enemies from Mario.

1165
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,940
This guy's from Mario 64.

1166
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,619
Oops.

1167
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:30,730
Who's the Mario enemy that looks like this?

1168
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:44,969
The swamp?

1169
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:45,690
Maybe.

1170
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,900
All right.

1171
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,500
Now let's that looks all right.

1172
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,699
It's a skull.

1173
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:55,349
Um, hold on.

1174
00:56:55,349 --> 00:57:00,440
Let me hothead.

1175
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,159
Yes, that's the one.

1176
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:01,639
Thank you.

1177
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:02,199
Hothead.

1178
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:10,860
Wait, there's a thing in the middle too, right?

1179
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:22,900
I need red.

1180
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,019
That's kind of like a clown.

1181
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:26,739
Wait, give me the smear tool.

1182
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:27,940
That's what I want to use.

1183
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:42,599
Perfect.

1184
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:44,789
Sell it.

1185
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:46,389
Send it quick.

1186
00:57:46,389 --> 00:57:46,949
Skull.

1187
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:51,130
I need to take a picture of it.

1188
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,630
Oh, well.

1189
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:56,710
How do I clean up?

1190
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,550
I need to.

1191
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:58,789
Okay.

1192
00:57:58,789 --> 00:58:00,309
Time to clean up the station here.

1193
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:02,579
Station cleanup time.

1194
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:06,650
We didn't even vote for it.

1195
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:12,940
Oh, vote for that one.

1196
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,260
All right.

1197
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,539
You guys remember what it looked like?

1198
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:19,420
What was it?

1199
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,219
Well, I clean up.

1200
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:21,980
A package has arrived.

1201
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:31,579
Package has arrived?

1202
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:34,619
Just dump the bucket.

1203
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:35,659
A two?

1204
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:38,039
A 2.8?

1205
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:38,760
Two?

1206
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,369
That was a two.

1207
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:44,630
That was not a two.

1208
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:47,400
How was that a two?

1209
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:55,099
It was zero effort.

1210
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:55,739
No, it wasn't.

1211
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:57,659
That was me just going just visceral.

1212
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:02,739
Not everything has to have a plan.

1213
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,550
Why does everything have to have a plan?

1214
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:13,480
Everything has to have a plan, Arthur.

1215
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:21,659
Not everything has to have a plan.

1216
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:23,579
But it does.

1217
00:59:23,659 --> 00:59:26,139
Doesn't it, Arthur?

1218
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:29,349
Yeah, doesn't it, Goku?

1219
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:30,389
I'm not going to do it.

1220
00:59:30,389 --> 00:59:31,670
Some people hate that, by the way.

1221
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:43,619
I've seen at least half a dozen comments saying,

1222
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,780
I really fucking hate it when he just adds a Goku

1223
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,619
to the end of everything when he does a low voice.

1224
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:50,650
I've read that.

1225
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,369
I've seen that.

1226
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:01,639
All right.

1227
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,920
No more just throwing shit on the ground.

1228
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:08,550
This game is sick, though.

1229
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,510
I love this game.

1230
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:12,460
This shit's free.

1231
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:15,059
You don't have to buy it if you don't want to.

1232
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,559
What's the story mode going to be like?

1233
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,000
There's more to this game?

1234
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:22,389
How did you make this free?

1235
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,139
This is free.

1236
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,179
This is a free game.

1237
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:30,619
This is 100% for free.

1238
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,309
There's actually no strings attached to this.

1239
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:36,789
You just go.

1240
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:39,110
You can play exactly what I'm doing right now for free on Steam.

1241
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,489
This game's called Such Art.

1242
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,369
It's a fucking free game.

1243
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:55,050
I love the water effects, too.

1244
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:56,010
A lot of time went into it.

1245
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:57,130
You can tell time went into this.

1246
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,170
I like this.

1247
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,449
I have an incredible offer for you.

1248
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:00,409
What is it?

1249
01:01:00,409 --> 01:01:03,929
I'm Arly.

1250
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:06,010
You're in my top 30 favorite artists.

1251
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,769
I'm so glad a friend told me about you.

1252
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:08,570
What I want?

1253
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:09,289
Boredom.

1254
01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:10,730
With your personal touch.

1255
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,710
The size of the canvas is up to you.

1256
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,750
155 bucks.

1257
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,820
You're in my top 30.

1258
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:21,210
Excellent link.

1259
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:21,929
Hold on.

1260
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:22,809
I'll be the judge of that.

1261
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:29,829
250 million off the debt if you choose a random Bob Ross video and follow along.

1262
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,139
All right.

1263
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:37,579
Hold on to that one.

1264
01:01:37,579 --> 01:01:39,179
Why is 1 billion scratched off?

1265
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:40,889
All right.

1266
01:01:40,889 --> 01:01:41,449
Hold on to that one.

1267
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:41,849
We'll do it.

1268
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:43,429
That sounds like fun.

1269
01:01:43,989 --> 01:01:46,949
Can I do that?

1270
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:50,039
Can I watch a Bob Ross painting on Twitch?

1271
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:52,489
Am I allowed to do that?

1272
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:57,780
No, that's not like a problem, right?

1273
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,909
All right.

1274
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:00,789
So anyways, I have spoken.

1275
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:01,750
So this is what he wants.

1276
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,949
They want boredom with my personal touch.

1277
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:05,190
Sure.

1278
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,940
Boredom with my personal touch.

1279
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:22,809
I'm just getting the I'm getting the spot ready.

1280
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:24,730
No, I don't want the big canvas.

1281
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:25,530
It's too much for me.

1282
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,449
I want a little canvas.

1283
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:29,369
This one's perfect.

1284
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:32,820
This is perfect.

1285
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,389
Spin this around.

1286
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:39,579
Boredom.

1287
01:02:39,579 --> 01:02:40,139
That's too much.

1288
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:40,460
You're going.

1289
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:42,090
You know what?

1290
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,849
Wait a minute.

1291
01:02:44,409 --> 01:02:48,039
Holy shit.

1292
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:48,519
Wait a minute.

1293
01:02:59,559 --> 01:02:59,880
Whoa.

1294
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:01,750
Whoa.

1295
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:09,369
No shit.

1296
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:11,690
Whoa.

1297
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:16,440
Cool.

1298
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:16,760
I like.

1299
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,079
All right.

1300
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:17,559
I like that.

1301
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:20,789
This is a rainbow from every two-year-old

1302
01:03:20,789 --> 01:03:21,750
you've ever seen in your life.

1303
01:03:25,429 --> 01:03:26,550
I need Sprite cans.

1304
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:28,170
All right.

1305
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:28,889
We got green on there.

1306
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,760
We're doing a little bit this green right here.

1307
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,199
Let's test it.

1308
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,480
It looks all right.

1309
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:37,159
I'm going to stay far away.

1310
01:03:37,719 --> 01:03:57,510
Dude, this is like rotisserie chickening gas.

1311
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:58,630
How's that?

1312
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,030
You hear it?

1313
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,199
Cool.

1314
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:04,679
I like it.

1315
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:06,840
This is like outside with some grubs outside.

1316
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,360
I need a leaf.

1317
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:08,920
I need a leaf.

1318
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:11,659
Is there a leaf stencil?

1319
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,420
Not really.

1320
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:15,849
That's a leaf.

1321
01:04:16,489 --> 01:04:20,280
Can I make this small?

1322
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:29,880
Stop spinning.

1323
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,000
I need a leaf right here.

1324
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:38,519
Grubhub gives you.

1325
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:40,949
What the fuck are you talking about?

1326
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:43,050
Okay.

1327
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:43,849
I need a leaf.

1328
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:45,130
Yeah.

1329
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,250
Somebody's to turn the music off.

1330
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:46,570
Right.

1331
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:46,889
Sorry.

1332
01:04:51,139 --> 01:04:52,500
It's just way too loud.

1333
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,170
It can be in the background.

1334
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:54,889
That's fine.

1335
01:04:54,889 --> 01:04:55,130
All right.

1336
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:55,769
I need a leaf.

1337
01:04:56,329 --> 01:05:00,230
What color should it be?

1338
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,510
Should it be like maroon?

1339
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,190
Like fall?

1340
01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:04,230
This looks spring to me.

1341
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:05,769
I think it has to be green.

1342
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:15,079
Inspiration.

1343
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:15,320
Okay.

1344
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,099
Or what if I just like...

1345
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:21,260
All right.

1346
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,019
So it goes like wham, wham, wham.

1347
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:24,219
Droplet.

1348
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:24,940
Wham, wham.

1349
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:25,260
Okay.

1350
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:25,980
I'm just going to go for it.

1351
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:31,050
I'm going to go fall colors.

1352
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:31,659
All right.

1353
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:32,380
I need one of these things.

1354
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:40,840
Okay.

1355
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,800
Let's mix these together.

1356
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,480
What?

1357
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,019
I put that on my pants.

1358
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:59,139
Dude, that's a good one already.

1359
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:00,500
That's a good one.

1360
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,139
It's like a little guy.

1361
01:06:02,739 --> 01:06:02,980
Okay.

1362
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:04,650
Here we go.

1363
01:06:05,289 --> 01:06:06,650
Let's see if I can get this to happen.

1364
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,010
Is this clean?

1365
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:16,900
Okay.

1366
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,179
That's a perfect leaf.

1367
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:19,960
That's right.

1368
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,079
Okay.

1369
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:21,480
So it's...

1370
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:26,070
I don't have to be perfect.

1371
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:33,510
This is too big of a...

1372
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:37,260
No, that's not water.

1373
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:37,820
This is paint.

1374
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:45,300
Okay.

1375
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:45,460
All right.

1376
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,099
Here we go.

1377
01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:48,940
Looks like it's a one, two.

1378
01:06:48,940 --> 01:07:10,070
It's like a fucking shitty palm tree.

1379
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:11,849
No, it's okay.

1380
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:13,239
It's okay.

1381
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:34,300
It's okay.

1382
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:34,699
Shit.

1383
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:35,340
Hold on.

1384
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:42,389
I need a spray can.

1385
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:42,710
Oops.

1386
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:54,920
Okay.

1387
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,559
Give it to me.

1388
01:07:55,559 --> 01:08:02,820
This would be such a good VR game.

1389
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:03,219
That's right.

1390
01:08:03,219 --> 01:08:03,380
Okay.

1391
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:03,940
Hold on.

1392
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:12,889
I should just did it like this already.

1393
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:14,090
This is way better.

1394
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:45,449
I shrink that.

1395
01:08:45,449 --> 01:08:50,329
I need to blend.

1396
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:51,130
Blend it in a little bit.

1397
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:51,689
Hold on.

1398
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:54,579
I need like a blender.

1399
01:08:54,579 --> 01:08:55,220
This thing.

1400
01:08:55,220 --> 01:09:20,649
Or did I?

1401
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:21,989
Wait a minute.

1402
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:22,970
No, I didn't.

1403
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:23,689
Holy shit.

1404
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:24,170
Holy shit.

1405
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,050
This is awesome.

1406
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:26,970
This is in the background.

1407
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,569
This is like a beach.

1408
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:29,050
This is a beach.

1409
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:30,090
This is a fucking palm tree.

1410
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:30,729
That's a palm tree.

1411
01:09:30,729 --> 01:09:31,289
The beach.

1412
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:32,390
This is perfect.

1413
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:33,850
That's a background.

1414
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:34,170
That's a tree.

1415
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:34,729
The beach.

1416
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:38,140
That's like an animal crossing tree.

1417
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:38,380
Okay.

1418
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,020
No, that's perfect.

1419
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:39,260
Okay.

1420
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,060
I'm all right.

1421
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,859
If I go all the way up.

1422
01:09:42,859 --> 01:09:46,869
These guys need eyes.

1423
01:09:46,869 --> 01:09:53,350
Why did you smush caterpillars on the canvas?

1424
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:55,699
I didn't.

1425
01:09:55,699 --> 01:09:56,180
Hey.

1426
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,619
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1427
01:09:57,619 --> 01:10:11,380
Grow up.

1428
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:11,699
Hey.

1429
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,170
I didn't want to shrink his head.

1430
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:21,029
I want to paint.

1431
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:26,359
I can't paint on top of that

1432
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:27,880
because it's technically paint.

1433
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:37,159
Get over here.

1434
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:43,430
I killed him.

1435
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,310
I killed him.

1436
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:48,619
I didn't want that.

1437
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:49,260
Shit.

1438
01:10:49,260 --> 01:11:07,590
Is that like bat?

1439
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:08,789
Is that like a squished head?

1440
01:11:08,789 --> 01:11:13,000
Here we go.

1441
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,899
This is just part of their bodies.

1442
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:30,359
It's pickle Rick.

1443
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:34,100
I don't hate this so far.

1444
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:34,579
I actually really...

1445
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:35,220
What was this one?

1446
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:35,859
Boredom?

1447
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:40,819
What should I add?

1448
01:11:40,819 --> 01:11:41,060
Maybe...

1449
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:43,029
I don't know.

1450
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:43,989
I kind of like this.

1451
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:46,739
How's that?

1452
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:47,060
Awful.

1453
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:47,779
Looks fine.

1454
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:51,510
Is it bored?

1455
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:54,489
I actually like...

1456
01:11:54,489 --> 01:11:55,210
I like this one.

1457
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,319
What's the...

1458
01:11:57,319 --> 01:11:58,680
Look, and we'll go like this too.

1459
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:05,319
I like this one.

1460
01:12:05,319 --> 01:12:05,960
It's cute.

1461
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,659
I think I want to dress this up a little more.

1462
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:10,359
Or is it ready?

1463
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,079
What do you think?

1464
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:15,380
All right.

1465
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,500
Let's see what you guys think.

1466
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:21,109
It's ready.

1467
01:12:21,109 --> 01:12:22,630
I have a package to get too.

1468
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:32,739
I love it.

1469
01:12:32,739 --> 01:12:34,500
You guys can give me inspiration.

1470
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,220
6.0.

1471
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,180
Give me a break.

1472
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:45,770
That's better than the 6.0.

1473
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:48,020
Oh, it got squished.

1474
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,479
Flip it around.

1475
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:56,310
Oh, they got squished in.

1476
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:56,789
Oh, well.

1477
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:07,100
It's still wet.

1478
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:10,100
Wait, I can fix it before it goes.

1479
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:13,609
Let's give a check mark on it.

1480
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:22,539
Okay.

1481
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:23,739
Where's my...

1482
01:13:23,739 --> 01:13:24,699
I got a new package.

1483
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:27,859
Where did I get a package?

1484
01:13:27,859 --> 01:13:28,659
Important.

1485
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:29,859
Nothing.

1486
01:13:29,859 --> 01:13:31,479
Where's the package?

1487
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:37,350
What the fuck is this?

1488
01:13:43,939 --> 01:13:44,819
What the hell?

1489
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:46,779
Small...

1490
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:47,739
Ready for delivery.

1491
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,619
What's ready for delivery?

1492
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:54,470
Oh, shit.

1493
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:55,350
What's going on out here?

1494
01:13:56,569 --> 01:13:57,130
Okay.

1495
01:13:57,130 --> 01:14:00,170
For a second, I thought we were in a moving truck.

1496
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,359
I was like, we're going...

1497
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:03,880
We're on the highway right now.

1498
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,920
What the hell is going on?

1499
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:09,000
What's in here?

1500
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,500
Is there anything fragile in this?

1501
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:31,770
How do I open it?

1502
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:32,409
Dude.

1503
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:37,340
This is the best game ever.

1504
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:40,180
What's this one?

1505
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:40,899
Hearts?

1506
01:14:40,899 --> 01:14:46,840
You can drag it too?

1507
01:14:46,840 --> 01:15:00,279
What's the last one?

1508
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:01,479
Oh, god damn it.

1509
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:02,119
Are you kidding me?

1510
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:04,439
I could have just done this in the middle of the last one.

1511
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:06,539
Whatever.

1512
01:15:06,539 --> 01:15:07,720
All right.

1513
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:08,840
Let's get you guys involved.

1514
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:12,220
Pick three random challenges to make your life harder.

1515
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,659
The chat will then vote for one of them.

1516
01:15:13,659 --> 01:15:14,140
Don't cheat.

1517
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,180
They're watching you.

1518
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,119
Okay.

1519
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:17,880
Pick three random art styles for your next painting.

1520
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,479
The chat will then vote for one of them.

1521
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:20,899
You will fail.

1522
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:22,420
Perhaps your viewers are merciful.

1523
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:25,529
Okay.

1524
01:15:25,529 --> 01:15:26,090
How about...

1525
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:27,850
What do you guys think?

1526
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:38,729
We aren't merciful?

1527
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:40,539
Yes, you are.

1528
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:46,949
Thank you.

1529
01:15:47,829 --> 01:15:48,710
Thank you.

1530
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,750
Thank you very much.

1531
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:51,689
Thank you very much.

1532
01:15:51,689 --> 01:15:52,010
All right.

1533
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:54,949
Challenge my style.

1534
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:55,510
As real...

1535
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:56,310
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1536
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:56,949
I canceled this.

1537
01:15:56,949 --> 01:15:57,670
I need more time.

1538
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:00,600
It's gonna be longer than 15 seconds.

1539
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,140
30 seconds.

1540
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:03,460
All right.

1541
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,220
Challenge my style.

1542
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:11,260
Expressionist, Cubist, or Art Nouveau.

1543
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,859
I don't know what the third one is.

1544
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:15,100
So I have no idea.

1545
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:20,069
What is a Cubist?

1546
01:16:20,069 --> 01:16:28,550
I'm just gonna interpret that as draw cubes.

1547
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:29,109
Cubist.

1548
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,159
Okay.

1549
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:36,520
So it looks like we're gonna go Cubist.

1550
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:38,659
Sounds good.

1551
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:41,220
Analyze and cut your subject from different angles.

1552
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,659
Now make those cuts more abstract

1553
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:45,300
and reassemble them on your painting.

1554
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:45,619
Okay.

1555
01:16:45,619 --> 01:16:46,739
I'm gonna draw some cubes.

1556
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:47,539
I don't know.

1557
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:48,180
Whatever.

1558
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,090
All right.

1559
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:50,729
Canvas size.

1560
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:54,420
I want a normal one.

1561
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,140
Oops.

1562
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,979
Throw that one away.

1563
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:03,689
How do you throw a painting away?

1564
01:17:03,689 --> 01:17:04,090
Thank you.

1565
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:04,329
What?

1566
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,949
Okay.

1567
01:17:06,949 --> 01:17:08,149
One by...

1568
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,630
Let's do this.

1569
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:09,510
Let's just small one.

1570
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:09,909
Perfect.

1571
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:20,659
There you go.

1572
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:21,220
Cubist.

1573
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,899
Cubist.

1574
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:27,779
Cube painting.

1575
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:32,439
Cube painting.

1576
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:33,319
A cube painting.

1577
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:37,609
Interesting.

1578
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:40,100
Interesting.

1579
01:17:41,989 --> 01:17:42,630
Interesting.

1580
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:46,979
Interesting.

1581
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:54,760
Interesting.

1582
01:17:59,939 --> 01:18:00,579
Interesting.

1583
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:02,470
Very interesting.

1584
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:04,550
Very interesting.

1585
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:06,890
Interesting.

1586
01:18:07,989 --> 01:18:09,029
Very interesting.

1587
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,840
Very interesting indeed.

1588
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,800
Very interesting.

1589
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,300
Very interesting.

1590
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,909
Where's my sponge?

1591
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:23,430
That was very loud.

1592
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:23,750
Sorry.

1593
01:18:24,310 --> 01:19:02,739
All right.

1594
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:03,699
Where's the leaf blower?

1595
01:19:03,699 --> 01:19:05,659
Aim this right here.

1596
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:15,699
Clean that up.

1597
01:19:15,699 --> 01:19:16,819
Aim it directly down.

1598
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,920
I'm getting rid of the play like paintball.

1599
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:45,670
All right.

1600
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:46,789
Where is my...

1601
01:19:46,789 --> 01:19:47,989
Where's my leaf blower?

1602
01:19:47,989 --> 01:19:54,680
What is this thing?

1603
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,039
What is this?

1604
01:19:56,039 --> 01:19:56,760
What is this?

1605
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,710
Whoa.

1606
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:00,069
Holy shit.

1607
01:20:00,069 --> 01:20:00,470
This is...

1608
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:00,789
Let me...

1609
01:20:00,789 --> 01:20:01,109
Hold on.

1610
01:20:01,109 --> 01:20:03,079
Wait.

1611
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:03,800
What the fuck?

1612
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,600
This is awesome.

1613
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,079
All right.

1614
01:20:05,079 --> 01:20:10,170
This is like I got like eight brushes on it.

1615
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:17,899
I want to...

1616
01:20:17,899 --> 01:20:19,260
This is a mop.

1617
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:25,510
It's a mop.

1618
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,710
It's just a regular mop.

1619
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:28,789
I thought it was going to be like a bunch of paint brushes.

1620
01:20:28,789 --> 01:20:31,699
For a second, I thought it was clay.

1621
01:20:31,699 --> 01:20:33,380
I could like squeeze clay out of here.

1622
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:38,470
All right.

1623
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,710
I'll do the satisfying thing when you go like this.

1624
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:53,449
Keep going.

1625
01:20:53,449 --> 01:21:02,359
Oh.

1626
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:03,560
This cleaning up the paint.

1627
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,760
I want to do that later.

1628
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,539
I'm not...

1629
01:21:05,539 --> 01:21:06,260
Let's do that later.

1630
01:21:06,659 --> 01:21:09,399
Where's the leaf blower?

1631
01:21:09,399 --> 01:21:09,960
There it is.

1632
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,279
Here we go.

1633
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:12,630
You ready?

1634
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:12,869
There.

1635
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,760
Here's Cubist for you.

1636
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:40,939
Let's go.

1637
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:44,199
I'm just waiting for the mom to open the door and go,

1638
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:46,899
Jerry, what are you doing?

1639
01:21:46,899 --> 01:21:47,460
And I turn.

1640
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,720
I've got like lipstick all over my face.

1641
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,479
I've got all of her clothes on.

1642
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:56,420
I got like a pair of dad's shoes on that are way too big for me.

1643
01:21:56,420 --> 01:22:00,359
They're like eight sizes too big.

1644
01:22:00,359 --> 01:22:01,239
Jerry.

1645
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:10,039
What is she, mom?

1646
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:10,520
Cool.

1647
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,359
It made a really cool pattern.

1648
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:22,630
Look at the pattern it made.

1649
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:24,710
We need more.

1650
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:26,869
We need more paint.

1651
01:22:26,869 --> 01:22:30,060
Give me...

1652
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:33,210
Spin it.

1653
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:33,770
No.

1654
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:39,829
I'm not going to spin it because this symbolizes like the insanity.

1655
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:45,960
And this is me trying to be as stoic and normal as possible

1656
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,149
while the sanity just flows over me.

1657
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:54,710
Insanity, I mean.

1658
01:22:54,710 --> 01:23:05,529
In a true Cubism fashion, I stand strong while society just goes nuts.

1659
01:23:05,529 --> 01:23:11,510
I try as hard as I can to stay cool and stay strong and stay locked.

1660
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:14,390
But getting hit by all the crazy shit going on.

1661
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:20,729
I kind of like what it did to the floor.

1662
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:25,260
Okay, I got it right when it...

1663
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:25,579
I got it.

1664
01:23:25,579 --> 01:23:25,979
I got it.

1665
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:26,619
No, I didn't.

1666
01:23:26,619 --> 01:23:27,020
Fuck.

1667
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:27,579
It's okay.

1668
01:23:27,579 --> 01:23:30,359
That's the Joker.

1669
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:37,220
That was just for the Joker.

1670
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:38,340
I want a bucket of paint.

1671
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,699
I want to spray it everywhere.

1672
01:23:39,699 --> 01:24:00,619
Isn't it fun to make a mess when it doesn't even matter?

1673
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,460
You're pretending this is some profound statement

1674
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:08,460
when you just don't actually know what Cubism is.

1675
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,180
Oh, it's full.

1676
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:19,699
Okay.

1677
01:24:19,699 --> 01:24:20,420
Hell yeah.

1678
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:23,430
It was like, I know what Cubism is.

1679
01:24:47,289 --> 01:24:49,699
We call that an accident.

1680
01:24:49,699 --> 01:24:51,140
That's not a happy accident.

1681
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:55,029
That is, you've ruined the whole painting.

1682
01:24:55,029 --> 01:24:56,630
Looks like it's red now.

1683
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:58,859
Okay.

1684
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:01,029
What do you think?

1685
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:02,840
Cubism.

1686
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:12,539
Okay.

1687
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:13,500
How do I wash the...

1688
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,739
Can I just press a button and have the sprinkler system come on?

1689
01:25:15,739 --> 01:25:26,630
Because that's the only way this is getting clean.

1690
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:27,350
Zero and ten.

1691
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:35,220
Therefore, it's a five rate.

1692
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:36,500
I'm going to put this on the marketplace.

1693
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,699
Let me sign it first.

1694
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:57,479
It's a Spider-Man popsicle.

1695
01:25:57,479 --> 01:25:58,039
I win.

1696
01:25:58,039 --> 01:25:59,239
Spider-Man popsicle.

1697
01:25:59,239 --> 01:25:59,560
I won.

1698
01:25:59,560 --> 01:25:59,880
I won.

1699
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:00,039
I won.

1700
01:26:00,039 --> 01:26:01,159
It's a Spider-Man popsicle.

1701
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:01,880
It's okay.

1702
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:14,949
It's fixed.

1703
01:26:14,949 --> 01:26:16,470
Marketplace.

1704
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:22,310
Sell it for 250 hours.

1705
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:27,500
No, 100 bucks.

1706
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,060
New vote.

1707
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:28,619
New vote.

1708
01:26:28,619 --> 01:26:29,100
New vote.

1709
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:29,500
New vote.

1710
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,140
All right, all right, all right.

1711
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:35,210
Challenge my skills.

1712
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,250
One minute to paint.

1713
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,489
Paint with your eyes closed or one single stroke.

1714
01:26:42,199 --> 01:26:43,479
How am I going to do any of these?

1715
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:45,800
How am I going to do one minute?

1716
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:49,819
One single stroke?

1717
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:53,369
Paint with your eyes closed.

1718
01:26:53,369 --> 01:26:54,090
I don't even...

1719
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:54,569
I can't...

1720
01:26:54,569 --> 01:26:57,289
How am I supposed to do that without somebody being in the room here?

1721
01:26:57,289 --> 01:26:58,699
I need to put a pair of...

1722
01:26:58,699 --> 01:26:59,979
I need to put clothes on for this.

1723
01:26:59,979 --> 01:27:00,699
Fuck.

1724
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:07,220
The only reason why you guys are clicking on that is because you want the webcam.

1725
01:27:09,939 --> 01:27:10,340
All right.

1726
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:11,060
Fine.

1727
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:11,939
Let me set this up.

1728
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,800
Can I clean the area up first?

1729
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:18,310
Let me clean up first.

1730
01:27:18,949 --> 01:27:24,819
I got to do a full cleanup.

1731
01:27:24,819 --> 01:27:26,260
This is disgusting.

1732
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,949
I got to...

1733
01:27:28,949 --> 01:27:29,909
It's disgusting.

1734
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:31,289
Give me a minute.

1735
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:34,220
I got to organize.

1736
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,619
This is just absolutely fucking revolting.

1737
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:37,340
Where's the trash?

1738
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:46,739
Where's the trash can?

1739
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:47,779
Is this trash?

1740
01:27:47,779 --> 01:27:48,180
Over here?

1741
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:51,979
I guess so.

1742
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:57,529
All right.

1743
01:27:57,529 --> 01:27:59,029
Trash.

1744
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:00,149
He's stalling.

1745
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:01,189
Yeah, well, whatever.

1746
01:28:05,449 --> 01:28:06,569
Oh, I'm sorry.

1747
01:28:06,569 --> 01:28:07,369
Ow, my face.

1748
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:08,739
I'm really sorry.

1749
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:10,140
I didn't mean to.

1750
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:10,939
Don't do that again.

1751
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,850
Okay, I won't.

1752
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:24,819
Come with me.

1753
01:28:24,819 --> 01:28:25,779
I'm going to put you on the shelf.

1754
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:44,729
You want your favorite delicious nutrition paste?

1755
01:28:44,729 --> 01:28:45,229
Okay.

1756
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:46,329
Clean.

1757
01:28:46,329 --> 01:28:47,449
Oh, this looks nice.

1758
01:28:47,449 --> 01:28:48,569
Clean, clean, clean, clean.

1759
01:28:48,569 --> 01:28:49,449
Give me that bucket.

1760
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:50,899
Move this stuff out of the way.

1761
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:53,939
Okay, that's what those are.

1762
01:28:53,939 --> 01:28:55,060
I thought there were bugs everywhere.

1763
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:56,260
All right, give me my trash.

1764
01:28:56,260 --> 01:29:01,689
There's a gift above the water tap.

1765
01:29:01,689 --> 01:29:04,500
How do I get up there?

1766
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:17,399
What is this?

1767
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:28,939
Is everyone saying compact?

1768
01:29:28,939 --> 01:29:33,510
Do you understand that this is like 14 feet tall ceilings?

1769
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:34,550
Okay, open.

1770
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:39,909
What is it?

1771
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:40,310
A ball?

1772
01:29:47,859 --> 01:29:48,659
Whoa.

1773
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:52,220
Can I put paint on it and throw it around?

1774
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:58,729
Can I cover it in paint?

1775
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:26,069
Hold on.

1776
01:30:26,069 --> 01:30:27,029
Dip it in a bucket.

1777
01:30:27,029 --> 01:30:31,909
Hold on, let me.

1778
01:30:31,909 --> 01:30:36,409
All right, dip it in a bucket of paint.

1779
01:30:36,409 --> 01:30:37,210
Sure, fill this.

1780
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:38,649
I'll roll it around here.

1781
01:30:38,649 --> 01:30:54,140
Stalling, stalling.

1782
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:55,739
I'm playing.

1783
01:30:55,739 --> 01:30:56,699
I'm not stalling.

1784
01:30:56,699 --> 01:30:57,979
This whole game is painting.

1785
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:00,300
Just chill, okay?

1786
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:07,000
Chill.

1787
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,539
Don't make me take a break and go eat a piece of beef jerky.

1788
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:11,590
But I will.

1789
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:13,189
All right, let's dunk it in the paint.

1790
01:31:13,189 --> 01:31:13,909
Where'd it go?

1791
01:31:28,569 --> 01:31:30,409
Whoa, it rolls down.

1792
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:36,380
Wow.

1793
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:47,189
Is there any more fun toys?

1794
01:31:47,189 --> 01:31:49,640
Put a canvas on the floor.

1795
01:31:49,640 --> 01:32:00,010
Yeah, but it's the biggest one I can get.

1796
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,130
One, three.

1797
01:32:01,130 --> 01:32:04,920
One, two.

1798
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,050
One, one.

1799
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:08,409
No, this is tiny.

1800
01:32:08,409 --> 01:32:09,050
Sell it back.

1801
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:14,869
Right here.

1802
01:32:14,869 --> 01:32:18,760
One, 13.

1803
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1804
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:21,560
Yes.

1805
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,779
Give it to me.

1806
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:28,180
How do I move this?

1807
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:33,430
Can I not pick this up?

1808
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:42,359
Five minutes ago, he said you were going to clean this place up.

1809
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:42,760
What am I?

1810
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,789
You know, strong enough.

1811
01:32:44,789 --> 01:32:45,909
Hurry and turn the cam on.

1812
01:32:45,909 --> 01:32:46,949
All right, we'll just wait a minute.

1813
01:32:46,949 --> 01:33:11,369
What is this?

1814
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:12,729
I thought that was my doorbell.

1815
01:33:12,729 --> 01:33:14,010
I was about to freak out.

1816
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:40,920
I was like, somebody here.

1817
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,279
That's a dick.

1818
01:33:42,279 --> 01:33:43,479
I have to change that.

1819
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:48,539
I don't know, like this one.

1820
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:49,100
Whatever.

1821
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:59,260
Better.

1822
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:22,520
Okay, good.

1823
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:23,159
Who?

1824
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:24,680
Okay, what do we have for customers?

1825
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,539
Offer.

1826
01:34:27,539 --> 01:34:30,569
I'm Scarleth.

1827
01:34:30,569 --> 01:34:32,170
Always stay strong in the face of adversity.

1828
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:32,970
I'd like a painting from you.

1829
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:34,170
Something warm.

1830
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:35,699
Big canvas.

1831
01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:36,340
Thank you.

1832
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,460
This is pure art.

1833
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:38,260
I'm amazed.

1834
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,550
You're my favorite human artist.

1835
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:41,670
Stay free.

1836
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:42,470
I need a painting for you.

1837
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:43,670
The portrait of a demon.

1838
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:44,869
In Dada style.

1839
01:34:44,869 --> 01:34:45,670
Don't know what that is.

1840
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:46,760
Got it.

1841
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,640
Incredible offer.

1842
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,140
Yep.

1843
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:50,550
All right, well, hold on.

1844
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:51,829
End of the simulation.

1845
01:34:51,829 --> 01:34:56,060
This is the end of your simulated training program.

1846
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:57,899
While you can spend more time training your skills here,

1847
01:34:57,899 --> 01:35:00,140
no more virtual clients will try to contact you.

1848
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:02,699
Hope your natural talent for the art has been further simulated.

1849
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:05,140
Yet another disappointment.

1850
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:06,100
Can't wait to have a real studio.

1851
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:09,640
Equipped with liquid art runs through my veins.

1852
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,239
End of the trial.

1853
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:11,720
No.

1854
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,899
Let me end it.

1855
01:35:13,899 --> 01:35:14,539
That's not.

1856
01:35:14,539 --> 01:35:19,289
Your painting is on its way to the marketplace.

1857
01:35:19,289 --> 01:35:20,699
Offer.

1858
01:35:20,699 --> 01:35:21,100
You want a...

1859
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:21,979
Do you want something warm?

1860
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:32,199
Hey, this kind of looks good.

1861
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:48,220
Turn the camera on.

1862
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,659
I'm gonna do a camera one.

1863
01:35:49,659 --> 01:35:50,220
Just hold on.

1864
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:50,859
I have to like...

1865
01:35:50,859 --> 01:35:53,579
Let me take a break and put on a t-shirt.

1866
01:35:53,579 --> 01:36:04,220
Jump into the laser now.

1867
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:05,739
No, it's probably gonna kill me.

1868
01:36:05,739 --> 01:36:16,180
It's fine.

1869
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:16,979
Hey, hey, hey.

1870
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,420
Seize get degrees, guys.

1871
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:19,699
Oops, I just ruined it.

1872
01:36:19,699 --> 01:36:19,939
Whatever.

1873
01:36:19,939 --> 01:36:20,579
I don't care.

1874
01:36:20,579 --> 01:36:25,699
End it.

1875
01:36:25,699 --> 01:36:29,779
Oh, this is not big enough.

1876
01:36:29,779 --> 01:36:32,649
Sell it on the marketplace.

1877
01:36:32,649 --> 01:36:40,680
For 50 bucks.

1878
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:42,840
SD5 added to the marketplace.

1879
01:36:49,479 --> 01:36:50,279
This looks funny.

1880
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:51,289
Okay.

1881
01:36:51,289 --> 01:36:51,609
All right.

1882
01:36:51,609 --> 01:36:52,090
Let me...

1883
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:52,810
I need this.

1884
01:36:53,449 --> 01:36:54,090
I'll do the...

1885
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:56,890
I closed one on like a decent size canvas over here.

1886
01:36:56,890 --> 01:37:04,819
Well, this is...

1887
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:05,380
This is fine.

1888
01:37:13,609 --> 01:37:14,409
Right there.

1889
01:37:14,409 --> 01:37:15,939
A little bit higher.

1890
01:37:15,939 --> 01:37:22,010
Close your darn eyeballs.

1891
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:22,569
I will.

1892
01:37:22,569 --> 01:37:22,970
I'm not gonna...

1893
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:24,949
I'm just setting it up.

1894
01:37:24,949 --> 01:37:26,069
What's this link?

1895
01:37:26,069 --> 01:37:28,199
It says...

1896
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,260
I don't know.

1897
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:34,090
I don't know what the hell you just linked me.

1898
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:34,890
I don't...

1899
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:35,770
What is this?

1900
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:43,739
What is this?

1901
01:37:43,739 --> 01:38:05,109
This is from Ferris Bueller's Day Off?

1902
01:38:05,109 --> 01:38:06,310
I don't remember this.

1903
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:09,369
I don't...

1904
01:38:09,369 --> 01:38:11,449
I don't remember.

1905
01:38:11,449 --> 01:38:14,420
I've seen this movie a few times,

1906
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:16,340
but it's been a very long time.

1907
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:25,399
100 million off the debt if you clean the studio

1908
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:27,880
and keep it clean for the rest of the stream.

1909
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:31,460
I don't think I can do that.

1910
01:38:32,619 --> 01:38:34,060
Clean the studio.

1911
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:36,310
Wait, what is this?

1912
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:39,340
It says 100 million off the debt

1913
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:40,539
if you clean the studio

1914
01:38:40,539 --> 01:38:49,159
and keep it clean the rest of the stream.

1915
01:38:49,159 --> 01:38:49,640
I can...

1916
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:51,779
That's not gonna happen.

1917
01:38:51,779 --> 01:38:52,020
All right.

1918
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:52,739
Let's take a break.

1919
01:38:52,739 --> 01:38:53,220
I'm gonna go pee.

1920
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,100
I'm gonna grab a...

1921
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,779
I'm gonna grab a beef stick.

1922
01:38:56,859 --> 01:38:58,229
And I'll be right back.

1923
01:38:58,229 --> 01:38:59,430
And then I'll make sure I have clothes on.

1924
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:00,869
I'll turn the face cam on.

1925
01:39:00,869 --> 01:39:02,710
And I will do a...

1926
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:03,670
I closed one.

1927
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:04,279
All right.

1928
01:39:04,279 --> 01:39:05,579
I'll be right back.

1929
01:39:05,579 --> 01:39:06,140
Here we go.

1930
01:39:06,140 --> 01:44:23,420
How many catboys?

1931
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:24,949
I left...

1932
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:27,979
I left like four or five minutes ago

1933
01:44:27,979 --> 01:44:29,659
with a catboy on camera.

1934
01:44:29,659 --> 01:44:33,659
And I came back and there's a catboy on camera.

1935
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:34,460
It's like...

1936
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:35,979
It's just all catboys.

1937
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:40,060
All catboys.

1938
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,239
It was 90 plus percent catboys.

1939
01:44:43,239 --> 01:44:44,279
Oh my fucking god.

1940
01:44:44,279 --> 01:44:44,920
That's so funny.

1941
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:50,739
It's only catboy.

1942
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:54,409
They're holding a gun?

1943
01:44:54,970 --> 01:44:56,100
What is that?

1944
01:44:57,319 --> 01:44:57,720
Oops.

1945
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:58,600
All catboys.

1946
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:59,079
Why is...

1947
01:44:59,079 --> 01:44:59,560
Why is this...

1948
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,520
Why is he holding a gun?

1949
01:45:01,159 --> 01:45:05,159
All right.

1950
01:45:05,159 --> 01:45:09,270
Let me get my camera set up.

1951
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:09,829
One of us.

1952
01:45:09,829 --> 01:45:10,470
One of us.

1953
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:11,029
What the fuck?

1954
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:12,340
All right.

1955
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:12,579
Hold on.

1956
01:45:12,579 --> 01:45:19,260
Let me get my camera set up.

1957
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:20,060
Out of the way.

1958
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:22,010
Get this out of the way.

1959
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:24,090
And I'll close my goddamn eyes.

1960
01:45:29,909 --> 01:45:30,149
Okay.

1961
01:45:30,789 --> 01:45:33,350
Make sure this looks fine.

1962
01:45:34,069 --> 01:45:36,920
I've got a drink here too, by the way.

1963
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:37,399
Don't...

1964
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:38,920
Don't get mad at me.

1965
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:44,250
How am I gonna do this?

1966
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:53,420
Can you see me?

1967
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:55,859
Anybody see me?

1968
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:03,539
Why is my camera fucked up?

1969
01:46:10,819 --> 01:46:11,300
Wait.

1970
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:13,300
What is this?

1971
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:13,779
Fuck that.

1972
01:46:13,779 --> 01:46:14,420
Why is it...

1973
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,729
Get out of the way.

1974
01:46:16,729 --> 01:46:17,130
You see?

1975
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:21,770
Hello?

1976
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:28,789
You down there?

1977
01:46:28,789 --> 01:46:41,220
Why am I...

1978
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:41,539
Oh.

1979
01:46:41,539 --> 01:46:43,909
Hold on.

1980
01:46:43,909 --> 01:46:44,310
Oops.

1981
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:55,399
Oh.

1982
01:46:55,399 --> 01:46:58,359
Gotta get the good side in too.

1983
01:46:58,359 --> 01:46:58,760
We can't...

1984
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:00,760
We can't just have the bad side.

1985
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:08,020
Gotta get the good side in there too.

1986
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:10,500
We can't just have just the bad side.

1987
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:20,619
I have to keep my eyes closed.

1988
01:47:20,619 --> 01:47:23,319
I'll try it.

1989
01:47:23,319 --> 01:47:28,979
Raid song.

1990
01:47:28,979 --> 01:47:30,180
Family guy raid.

1991
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:36,380
We got a family guy raid?

1992
01:47:39,449 --> 01:47:42,899
Donkey just came in with a raid?

1993
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:43,699
What's going on, Donkey?

1994
01:47:46,439 --> 01:47:47,560
What's going on, everybody?

1995
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:48,199
Welcome.

1996
01:47:48,199 --> 01:47:51,100
I'm just setting up a chat challenge video.

1997
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:51,899
Family guy?

1998
01:47:51,899 --> 01:47:53,819
Should I sing family guy?

1999
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:55,500
I'm not gonna do that.

2000
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,539
There's 6,000 new people.

2001
01:47:56,539 --> 01:48:01,850
No way.

2002
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:02,329
What's up?

2003
01:48:02,329 --> 01:48:03,289
Thanks for the raid.

2004
01:48:03,289 --> 01:48:04,649
This is fucking crazy.

2005
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:07,989
I've been a fan of Donkey's for years.

2006
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:12,119
He was one of the YouTubers.

2007
01:48:12,119 --> 01:48:13,560
I'll tell you, the capture video,

2008
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:16,229
that's one of the best videos on YouTube.

2009
01:48:16,229 --> 01:48:18,329
Like, hands down.

2010
01:48:18,329 --> 01:48:19,850
The capture Donkey video

2011
01:48:20,409 --> 01:48:23,689
is one of the best YouTube videos on YouTube.

2012
01:48:23,689 --> 01:48:25,979
I'm gonna be gushing here for a little bit.

2013
01:48:25,979 --> 01:48:26,699
Sorry.

2014
01:48:30,149 --> 01:48:31,510
So what we're doing right now...

2015
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:32,310
Thank you again, Donkey.

2016
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:33,189
Welcome, guys.

2017
01:48:33,189 --> 01:48:35,430
We're doing a art stream.

2018
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:37,510
And part of it is, as you'll see...

2019
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:37,989
Hold on.

2020
01:48:37,989 --> 01:48:38,550
Whoa!

2021
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:38,869
You just...

2022
01:48:38,869 --> 01:48:40,310
Now you can see what I look like with the white.

2023
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:44,390
Turn that back off!

2024
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:45,659
Shit!

2025
01:48:45,659 --> 01:48:46,859
With like a real camera?

2026
01:48:51,979 --> 01:48:53,100
Why do I not know how to drink?

2027
01:48:53,819 --> 01:48:54,779
This is not even alcohol.

2028
01:48:54,779 --> 01:48:55,500
I just lied to you.

2029
01:48:56,710 --> 01:48:57,109
Ew!

2030
01:48:57,109 --> 01:48:58,470
He's like ugly now.

2031
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,619
Okay, so the goal here was...

2032
01:49:03,779 --> 01:49:05,060
I got challenged.

2033
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:06,010
I'm connected.

2034
01:49:06,010 --> 01:49:06,729
Look, look, look.

2035
01:49:06,729 --> 01:49:07,539
Here you go.

2036
01:49:07,539 --> 01:49:08,899
So this is connected to Twitch right now.

2037
01:49:08,899 --> 01:49:09,699
And it's a cool game.

2038
01:49:09,699 --> 01:49:10,979
It's called Art...

2039
01:49:10,979 --> 01:49:12,199
What's the name of the game?

2040
01:49:13,909 --> 01:49:15,899
Such Art.

2041
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:18,460
It's a game where you just kind of can do whatever you want.

2042
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,060
There's spray cans.

2043
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,659
There's paint brushes.

2044
01:49:21,659 --> 01:49:22,779
It's really fucking cool.

2045
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:25,100
So we'll see what they do.

2046
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:28,220
Oh, the challenge, right.

2047
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:29,739
I have to keep my eyes closed in the next painting.

2048
01:49:29,739 --> 01:49:30,140
But let me get...

2049
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:31,579
Okay, while you guys do, let me set this up.

2050
01:49:31,579 --> 01:49:34,039
Because this is not ready at all.

2051
01:49:34,039 --> 01:49:34,920
I want...

2052
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,039
What color should I do?

2053
01:49:36,039 --> 01:49:39,140
Let me get this...

2054
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:40,100
Hold on.

2055
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:40,819
Right.

2056
01:49:40,819 --> 01:49:46,409
And you can go like this.

2057
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,079
You get this cleaning in the game.

2058
01:49:49,079 --> 01:49:51,000
If you like viscera cleanup detail, you're gonna love it.

2059
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:51,800
It's free.

2060
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:53,720
Make sure I say that.

2061
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,579
Get it out of here.

2062
01:49:55,579 --> 01:49:57,460
Free game.

2063
01:49:57,460 --> 01:49:58,819
This is free.

2064
01:49:58,819 --> 01:50:08,819
You want to see the amount of content that's here for free?

2065
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:09,699
Okay, I need this brush.

2066
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:12,220
This brush here.

2067
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,699
I need to have a palette.

2068
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,649
Okay, let me get this back over here.

2069
01:50:19,289 --> 01:50:20,409
I need to clean this.

2070
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:23,210
So if my eyes are gonna be closed, I have to be...

2071
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:25,479
I gotta be really close.

2072
01:50:25,479 --> 01:50:26,600
So this is gonna go up here.

2073
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:30,539
I'm gonna clean it like this.

2074
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:31,899
So if I...

2075
01:50:31,899 --> 01:50:34,220
It's right there.

2076
01:50:34,779 --> 01:50:35,260
So it's...

2077
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:36,859
How many degrees is that?

2078
01:50:36,859 --> 01:50:41,659
That is burp puked.

2079
01:50:43,210 --> 01:50:44,170
How many degrees is this?

2080
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:48,060
One, two.

2081
01:50:49,689 --> 01:50:50,729
I took one sip of this.

2082
01:50:50,729 --> 01:50:52,859
It's a ginger beer.

2083
01:50:52,859 --> 01:50:53,819
Oh, you're urinating.

2084
01:50:53,819 --> 01:50:59,420
No, I'm not.

2085
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:02,090
Okay, so let me clean this.

2086
01:51:06,539 --> 01:51:09,109
Do it. Vomit.

2087
01:51:09,109 --> 01:51:10,729
Shut up.

2088
01:51:10,729 --> 01:51:14,500
Fuck.

2089
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:19,500
Fuck up.

2090
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:23,380
What are you writing?

2091
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:24,340
Mr. Jeremy, sir.

2092
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:27,060
I'm gonna read it until it gets fucking deleted from the mod.

2093
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:30,470
Mr. Jeremy, sir.

2094
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:31,909
I've been to ask this for almost four months now.

2095
01:51:31,909 --> 01:51:32,550
I cannot sleep.

2096
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:34,550
I stayed for nights going through this thought process

2097
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:35,909
in my head over and over again.

2098
01:51:35,909 --> 01:51:37,590
My wife cannot even look at me in the eyes anymore

2099
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:39,750
and she's moved to her mother's house.

2100
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:42,310
I need to know if you urinate standing up or sitting down.

2101
01:51:42,310 --> 01:51:43,510
I know this is somewhat off limits,

2102
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:47,029
but this morbid curiosity is ruining my life.

2103
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,319
That's an easy...

2104
01:51:49,319 --> 01:51:49,960
I can answer that.

2105
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:55,289
If you just go number one, you stand.

2106
01:51:55,289 --> 01:51:57,130
If you go number two, you go number one

2107
01:51:57,130 --> 01:52:01,239
after you go number two while you're sitting.

2108
01:52:01,239 --> 01:52:02,039
Easy.

2109
01:52:02,039 --> 01:52:08,180
That's correct.

2110
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:16,310
You go number two and you're still sitting there.

2111
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:17,590
So it's like, all right, might as well do number one too.

2112
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:20,380
I'm right here.

2113
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:21,100
That's like a fact.

2114
01:52:21,739 --> 01:52:23,260
If you don't do that, you're a liar.

2115
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:29,029
So wait, let me get this straight.

2116
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:32,949
You go shit and then after you shit, you go,

2117
01:52:32,949 --> 01:52:36,630
if you have to pee, you stand up and turn around

2118
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:40,539
and pee into the toilet.

2119
01:52:40,539 --> 01:52:45,050
Can I understand that one?

2120
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:47,130
I'm confused.

2121
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:49,770
You go before, but what if you have to go?

2122
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,449
What if you have to go afterwards?

2123
01:52:53,449 --> 01:52:54,970
What, you're just going to hold it?

2124
01:52:54,970 --> 01:52:59,020
Is that such a big deal to pee while you're sitting down

2125
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:00,140
for a lot of you guys?

2126
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:05,500
You just don't go.

2127
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,000
What?

2128
01:53:10,069 --> 01:53:11,109
You just don't go.

2129
01:53:13,979 --> 01:53:16,420
Why?

2130
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:17,460
Toilet humor stream.

2131
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,340
No, this is not toilet.

2132
01:53:18,899 --> 01:53:20,979
I'm actually curious if you guys are gaslighting or not.

2133
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:24,220
God, I'm so sick of being gaslit every day.

2134
01:53:26,579 --> 01:53:26,979
What is this?

2135
01:53:26,979 --> 01:53:30,550
Oh, I need that.

2136
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:31,909
Okay, so what colors do I want?

2137
01:53:31,909 --> 01:53:37,270
I want to do, we'll do like a gray.

2138
01:53:38,359 --> 01:53:41,670
We'll do a yellow.

2139
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:43,909
Yellow and other yellow.

2140
01:53:43,909 --> 01:53:49,220
Mustard, pink and purple.

2141
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:51,020
Good.

2142
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:52,460
Okay, so let's go here.

2143
01:53:53,100 --> 01:54:06,550
I got to remember where these are.

2144
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:11,050
Okay, so that's purple and pink are on the left side.

2145
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:15,479
Mustard and yellow are in the middle and blacks on the right.

2146
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:22,979
Okay, so paintbrush one is here.

2147
01:54:24,489 --> 01:54:24,970
I need paint.

2148
01:54:24,970 --> 01:54:25,930
And this is another slot.

2149
01:54:26,489 --> 01:54:27,510
What just happened?

2150
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:30,520
Yeah, I don't like the slots these are in.

2151
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:34,760
I know this is a lot of setup, but bear with me.

2152
01:54:35,319 --> 01:54:37,500
I need water.

2153
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:47,880
Shirt your pants right now.

2154
01:54:49,909 --> 01:54:51,590
Had to do it.

2155
01:54:51,590 --> 01:54:53,829
The person gave like 500 community subs.

2156
01:54:53,829 --> 01:55:02,420
So this is going to be to my left.

2157
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:04,359
Oh, come on, dude.

2158
01:55:04,359 --> 01:55:04,760
Really?

2159
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:13,560
What the fuck?

2160
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,359
Actually did it.

2161
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:21,500
So this is in.

2162
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:22,939
That's correct.

2163
01:55:22,939 --> 01:55:26,779
Okay, so if I close my eyes, it's not close enough.

2164
01:55:26,779 --> 01:55:27,819
It's got to be closer.

2165
01:55:27,819 --> 01:55:33,060
Okay, there's the canvas.

2166
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:36,439
Okay, there it is.

2167
01:55:37,319 --> 01:55:38,520
And then I've got my paints over here.

2168
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:39,000
Here we go.

2169
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:41,000
All right, I'm going to start.

2170
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:41,800
Are you ready?

2171
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:44,619
I'm going to do...

2172
01:55:44,619 --> 01:55:45,340
Let's just go for it.

2173
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:46,699
See if I can do something here.

2174
01:55:46,699 --> 01:55:49,159
When do I close my eyes?

2175
01:55:49,159 --> 01:55:49,800
Now?

2176
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:53,140
Wait, should I close my eyes like...

2177
01:55:53,779 --> 01:55:55,619
Can I open them at all during the whole process?

2178
01:55:55,619 --> 01:55:56,899
How long do I do this for?

2179
01:55:56,899 --> 01:56:03,960
I don't have a time limit.

2180
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,750
I guess until I'm ready.

2181
01:56:06,310 --> 01:56:08,279
Set a timer.

2182
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:09,079
All right, what's the timer for?

2183
01:56:09,079 --> 01:56:09,560
Five minutes?

2184
01:56:10,119 --> 01:56:12,010
I was at a time for five minutes.

2185
01:56:12,010 --> 01:56:17,640
I just...

2186
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:18,760
Okay, I almost just...

2187
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,199
I almost just locked out my phone.

2188
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:22,840
I just did the password wrong like five times.

2189
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:24,039
I just deleted my whole phone.

2190
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:26,520
Jesus Christ.

2191
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,970
Okay, let's do...

2192
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:33,909
Timer.

2193
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:38,060
My alarms are so fucked up.

2194
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:42,539
My alarms right now, I have one for 7 a.m., 8.30 a.m.,

2195
01:56:42,539 --> 01:56:46,020
and then 1.30 p.m.

2196
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:47,220
After 8.30, it's kind of just like...

2197
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:47,939
Apparently, it's just like...

2198
01:56:47,939 --> 01:56:48,819
I guess fuck it.

2199
01:56:48,819 --> 01:56:52,229
I'm just going to stay asleep.

2200
01:56:52,229 --> 01:56:54,420
Okay, timer.

2201
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:58,090
Five minutes on the clock.

2202
01:56:58,090 --> 01:56:59,189
Ready?

2203
01:56:59,189 --> 01:57:06,380
Three, two, one, go!

2204
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:07,260
Oh, wait.

2205
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:14,090
I want the thick...

2206
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:14,970
Okay, one and two.

2207
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:15,449
Is this one?

2208
01:57:16,090 --> 01:57:22,579
Do I have paint on?

2209
01:57:22,579 --> 01:57:23,619
I don't even know if I have paint on.

2210
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:26,729
I think there's paint on this.

2211
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:38,140
I don't even know where I'm standing.

2212
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:46,760
I don't know where I'm standing.

2213
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:47,560
I heard something.

2214
01:57:52,340 --> 01:57:53,220
Where's the paint?

2215
01:57:53,779 --> 01:58:01,590
I don't know where I am.

2216
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:11,829
I gotta find the water bucket.

2217
01:58:11,829 --> 01:58:12,949
I think I'm on the...

2218
01:58:12,949 --> 01:58:13,750
I hear it.

2219
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:20,630
I don't know where the bucket is.

2220
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:22,310
I really have no idea where the bucket is.

2221
01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:26,170
Did I move?

2222
01:58:26,170 --> 01:58:31,859
Fuck it.

2223
01:58:31,859 --> 01:58:33,050
On the bucket.

2224
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:37,289
That means here's the canvas, which means here's the paint.

2225
01:58:37,289 --> 01:58:57,420
I have no idea what's happening.

2226
01:58:57,579 --> 01:59:28,310
Is this the bucket of water?

2227
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:42,359
I don't know what the you grabbed paint sound is.

2228
01:59:42,359 --> 01:59:43,479
Where's escape?

2229
01:59:43,479 --> 01:59:45,880
Okay, this tilde is one.

2230
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:52,859
I hear like the...

2231
01:59:52,859 --> 02:00:05,319
How long is it?

2232
02:00:05,319 --> 02:00:06,520
It's been five minutes yet.

2233
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:19,319
I think I did something wrong.

2234
02:00:19,319 --> 02:00:21,270
I think I just clicked something.

2235
02:00:28,619 --> 02:00:29,420
I don't know where the bucket is.

2236
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:34,630
I gotta find the bucket again.

2237
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:35,350
That's the bucket.

2238
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:38,390
That's the water bucket.

2239
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:40,699
So then this is the canvas.

2240
02:00:40,699 --> 02:00:45,739
So then this is the fucking palette.

2241
02:00:45,739 --> 02:00:47,260
Is this the palette to the right?

2242
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,510
Why is it making painting sounds?

2243
02:00:51,510 --> 02:01:06,630
How much time is left?

2244
02:01:09,939 --> 02:01:11,380
Is my phone on silent?

2245
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:11,699
Can I...

2246
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:12,260
Wait, hold on.

2247
02:01:12,899 --> 02:01:15,479
Can I look at the phone to make sure it's not on silent?

2248
02:01:15,479 --> 02:01:17,289
If I go like this, hold on.

2249
02:01:17,289 --> 02:01:19,500
How long has it been?

2250
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:25,189
Can I look?

2251
02:01:25,189 --> 02:01:26,420
Can I look at the phone?

2252
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:27,380
Please?

2253
02:01:27,939 --> 02:01:31,239
I don't even know what you're saying.

2254
02:01:37,659 --> 02:01:38,539
I'm painting something.

2255
02:01:38,539 --> 02:01:39,180
It could be the ground.

2256
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:39,659
It could be a wall.

2257
02:01:39,659 --> 02:01:40,220
I don't know.

2258
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:44,010
Where's my drink?

2259
02:01:44,010 --> 02:01:47,260
This is the stupidest thing ever.

2260
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:56,220
Why would I like just blindly reach for a drink?

2261
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:57,819
Why is that so hard to do that with my eyes closed?

2262
02:01:57,819 --> 02:01:59,579
It's not like that my muscle memory changes.

2263
02:02:00,220 --> 02:02:01,020
Do I need to see?

2264
02:02:01,979 --> 02:02:07,590
Holy shit, I did it.

2265
02:02:07,590 --> 02:02:11,189
Stop.

2266
02:02:11,189 --> 02:02:11,829
Shut the fuck up.

2267
02:02:16,779 --> 02:02:17,979
I actually did it.

2268
02:02:17,979 --> 02:02:26,149
What happened over here?

2269
02:02:26,149 --> 02:02:36,729
How long has it been like that?

2270
02:02:36,729 --> 02:02:40,170
I haven't had paint for like probably a long time.

2271
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:40,970
The whole time.

2272
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:41,850
Well, how did I get this?

2273
02:02:42,649 --> 02:02:43,899
All right, here you go.

2274
02:02:44,539 --> 02:02:47,210
What do you think?

2275
02:02:47,210 --> 02:03:02,810
I disconnected.

2276
02:03:02,810 --> 02:03:08,390
I'm in.

2277
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:10,489
Let's see what's going on here.

2278
02:03:10,489 --> 02:03:21,720
Game's not centered.

2279
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:24,420
It really isn't.

2280
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:27,659
How long has that been like that for?

2281
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:32,819
I think this is broken.

2282
02:03:32,819 --> 02:03:34,680
Yeah, this is fucked up.

2283
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:40,899
I'm going to disconnect and try to reconnect.

2284
02:03:40,899 --> 02:03:41,699
Where's my mouse?

2285
02:03:41,699 --> 02:03:43,640
What the fuck is going on?

2286
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:48,600
Where's the mouse?

2287
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:55,130
All right, disconnect.

2288
02:03:55,130 --> 02:03:57,770
Disconnect.

2289
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:59,819
Try it again.

2290
02:03:59,819 --> 02:04:01,460
Connect.

2291
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:03,930
This has just worked.

2292
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:08,600
Well, I'm going to say it was a 10.

2293
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:19,850
I'm going to restart it.

2294
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:21,800
Can I save the game like this?

2295
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:25,560
Do a straw poll instead.

2296
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:33,380
It's probably for the best that we can't rate this one.

2297
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:39,340
All right, now let me do that.

2298
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:40,140
All right, here we go.

2299
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:41,579
I want to do the Bob Ross thing.

2300
02:04:41,579 --> 02:04:52,859
I'm going to take a picture of this.

2301
02:04:52,859 --> 02:04:57,079
It was a pog out of 10.

2302
02:04:57,079 --> 02:04:58,680
All right, what's a good one to do?

2303
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:01,420
What's a good one that's not going to get me DMCA claimed?

2304
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:05,479
Does he have like a YouTube channel?

2305
02:05:05,479 --> 02:05:11,850
I need a new canvas, first of all, and I'm going to sell this.

2306
02:05:11,850 --> 02:05:23,899
I'm selling this for 200, 150.

2307
02:05:23,899 --> 02:05:27,510
He's on Twitch right now.

2308
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:29,270
Just co-stream the one on Twitch.

2309
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:30,789
But I have to catch up, don't I?

2310
02:05:30,789 --> 02:05:36,329
There's a Bob Ross right now on Twitch.

2311
02:05:36,329 --> 02:05:37,369
I have to catch up.

2312
02:05:37,369 --> 02:05:38,489
I'm not prepared for that.

2313
02:05:38,489 --> 02:05:39,289
He just started.

2314
02:05:39,289 --> 02:05:40,409
Did he just start?

2315
02:05:40,409 --> 02:05:54,939
What happened to the top?

2316
02:05:54,939 --> 02:05:57,739
Where's the top?

2317
02:05:58,300 --> 02:06:02,920
What happened to the top?

2318
02:06:03,479 --> 02:06:06,789
Wasn't there a top to this?

2319
02:06:07,430 --> 02:06:07,909
Where'd it go?

2320
02:06:08,630 --> 02:06:11,050
Wasn't this sitting on top of this?

2321
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:18,659
Yikes.

2322
02:06:18,659 --> 02:06:21,689
Jesus.

2323
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:33,850
Holy shit, that was bad.

2324
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:37,079
Okay, I got to get a Bob Ross.

2325
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:39,079
I'm going to co-stream Bob Ross.

2326
02:06:39,079 --> 02:06:42,630
I'm going to do what he's doing on Twitch.

2327
02:06:42,710 --> 02:06:44,600
What's the link?

2328
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:58,649
Bob Ross, there it is.

2329
02:06:58,649 --> 02:06:59,529
I can do this, right?

2330
02:07:00,090 --> 02:07:01,399
I can do this, right?

2331
02:07:01,399 --> 02:07:02,359
I can do this.

2332
02:07:02,359 --> 02:07:11,100
I can do this, right?

2333
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:11,819
I can do this.

2334
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:15,529
I think so.

2335
02:07:16,090 --> 02:07:18,659
All right, let's go.

2336
02:07:18,659 --> 02:07:21,319
I'm going to turn the music down here.

2337
02:07:21,319 --> 02:07:25,050
I got to hurry up because he's going already.

2338
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:26,649
I got to catch up if I can.

2339
02:07:26,649 --> 02:07:31,850
If it's streaming, then yeah.

2340
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:33,369
Isn't that the whole point of Bob Ross?

2341
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:37,689
I guess.

2342
02:07:37,689 --> 02:07:39,930
I guess, I mean, this is like cool, I guess.

2343
02:07:39,930 --> 02:07:40,409
Hopefully.

2344
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:45,430
Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN.

2345
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:47,909
Okay, what do we got?

2346
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:54,569
Disney, Hulu, and ESPN.

2347
02:07:54,569 --> 02:07:59,189
I think the sketchy website I bought this turtle from.

2348
02:08:00,149 --> 02:08:01,590
I didn't buy a turtle.

2349
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:04,520
Get that up here.

2350
02:08:05,689 --> 02:08:06,569
Make this full screen.

2351
02:08:06,569 --> 02:08:07,289
Give me one sec.

2352
02:08:10,329 --> 02:08:11,859
Okay, can you see it?

2353
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:14,859
Shit, okay.

2354
02:08:14,859 --> 02:08:15,659
Wait, I can't hear it.

2355
02:08:17,369 --> 02:08:17,930
I can't hear it.

2356
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:18,409
I can't hear it.

2357
02:08:25,449 --> 02:08:28,329
He's already has a full fucking mountain.

2358
02:08:28,329 --> 02:08:29,930
I'm not going to be able to catch up to this.

2359
02:08:34,279 --> 02:08:35,560
He's got a beautiful mountain.

2360
02:08:36,199 --> 02:08:45,130
He just started this.

2361
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:45,609
That's it.

2362
02:08:58,300 --> 02:08:59,020
What is it, blue?

2363
02:09:03,989 --> 02:09:09,060
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

2364
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:13,220
Blue, white, and this thing too.

2365
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:13,460
White.

2366
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:14,020
Where's white?

2367
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:17,829
Blue, white, and gray.

2368
02:09:17,829 --> 02:09:18,069
Go.

2369
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:20,680
Doesn't matter.

2370
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:21,159
I just need it.

2371
02:09:33,369 --> 02:09:36,260
YouTube link.

2372
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:37,380
You need a brown too.

2373
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:39,770
Just YouTube it.

2374
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:40,010
Fuck.

2375
02:09:40,649 --> 02:09:41,289
Give me, give me.

2376
02:09:41,289 --> 02:09:42,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2377
02:09:42,090 --> 02:09:42,409
Stop that.

2378
02:09:42,409 --> 02:09:42,890
All right, give me.

2379
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:45,340
Where's the better one?

2380
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:46,300
Please, please, please.

2381
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:47,659
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2382
02:09:47,659 --> 02:09:48,779
Use YouTube, use YouTube.

2383
02:09:48,779 --> 02:09:50,060
This better not be a fucking screamer.

2384
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:50,699
I swear to God.

2385
02:09:50,699 --> 02:09:51,579
I will let it stream if it is.

2386
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:57,819
Not a screamer, but like, fuck you regardless still.

2387
02:10:07,859 --> 02:10:09,539
Did you just link me like your channel?

2388
02:10:20,229 --> 02:10:20,869
All right, how about this?

2389
02:10:20,869 --> 02:10:21,670
How about this?

2390
02:10:21,670 --> 02:10:22,630
We'll do the next one.

2391
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:23,350
We'll do the next one.

2392
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:24,310
We'll do the next one here.

2393
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:26,069
I don't want, I want to catch it.

2394
02:10:26,069 --> 02:10:32,890
This is Otto's Big Adventure 2.

2395
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:36,739
Great.

2396
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:38,659
Do you understand how hard this is going to be

2397
02:10:38,659 --> 02:10:40,500
to get somebody to give me a real video?

2398
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:41,460
We have to wait for the next one.

2399
02:10:42,579 --> 02:10:51,880
I guess I could just find it myself.

2400
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:55,460
Bob Ross.

2401
02:10:56,020 --> 02:11:01,130
Okay, Bob Ross follow along painting.

2402
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:03,659
This one is called

2403
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:10,579
in the midst of winter.

2404
02:11:10,579 --> 02:11:12,649
In the midst of winter.

2405
02:11:12,649 --> 02:11:17,720
This is the right one.

2406
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,319
No, I'm going to do in the midst of winter.

2407
02:11:19,319 --> 02:11:22,550
I really hope I can do this.

2408
02:11:35,819 --> 02:11:37,500
In the middle of winter is this one.

2409
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:45,340
Good grammar and spelling are important.

2410
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:46,779
Not anymore.

2411
02:11:46,779 --> 02:11:48,300
You can just type it into this grammar thing

2412
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:50,140
and just it corrects literally every mistake

2413
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:50,619
you've ever made.

2414
02:11:52,149 --> 02:11:53,350
You can just fucking just who cares.

2415
02:11:53,350 --> 02:11:55,430
Just mash your goddamn keyboard like a fucking piano.

2416
02:11:55,989 --> 02:11:56,550
Doesn't matter.

2417
02:11:56,550 --> 02:11:58,149
Send your emails will all get fixed.

2418
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:03,380
Okay, let's get this in the same spot.

2419
02:12:05,289 --> 02:12:07,210
It undermines the writer's message

2420
02:12:07,210 --> 02:12:08,569
and the word choice is bland.

2421
02:12:18,489 --> 02:12:19,050
Okay, here we go.

2422
02:12:19,050 --> 02:12:20,409
Glad to see you today.

2423
02:12:20,409 --> 02:12:22,500
Tell you what, let's get right on today

2424
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:24,420
and have them run all the colors across the screen

2425
02:12:24,420 --> 02:12:26,260
that you need to paint along with us at home.

2426
02:12:26,819 --> 02:12:28,420
While they're doing that, as usual,

2427
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:29,619
let me show you what I have.

2428
02:12:29,619 --> 02:12:30,100
What do I need?

2429
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:32,180
Today I have my standard old pre-stretched

2430
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:33,619
double primed canvas

2431
02:12:33,619 --> 02:12:35,619
and I've just covered it with a very thin coat

2432
02:12:35,619 --> 02:12:36,420
of liquid white.

2433
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:37,060
That's all.

2434
02:12:37,060 --> 02:12:38,180
It's wet and ready to go.

2435
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:40,100
So I thought today maybe we would do

2436
02:12:40,819 --> 02:12:42,100
let's do a little winter scene.

2437
02:12:42,100 --> 02:12:44,409
Something that's let's just see what happens.

2438
02:12:44,409 --> 02:12:46,170
Let's start with with black.

2439
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:46,970
Potato blue.

2440
02:12:46,970 --> 02:12:47,770
Or blue and black.

2441
02:12:48,409 --> 02:12:48,649
What?

2442
02:12:48,649 --> 02:12:49,770
Just sort of mixing together.

2443
02:12:49,770 --> 02:12:51,130
Black and blue and blue and black.

2444
02:12:51,130 --> 02:12:52,569
Black and blue and blue and black.

2445
02:12:52,569 --> 02:12:54,810
I thought we'd just play a little bit today.

2446
02:12:54,810 --> 02:12:56,569
I don't even have my paints here

2447
02:12:56,569 --> 02:12:58,010
and I hope it is wherever you're at.

2448
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:00,920
Just have a good time with this.

2449
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:06,890
We're just we'll just pop in a little sky here and there.

2450
02:13:08,090 --> 02:13:09,369
Something about like so.

2451
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:13,699
I'm leaving some spots open intentionally.

2452
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:16,579
Just little spots.

2453
02:13:16,579 --> 02:13:18,739
I don't want this to be a flat old dead sky.

2454
02:13:19,460 --> 02:13:20,659
I wanted to have some life.

2455
02:13:20,659 --> 02:13:21,619
Some action to it.

2456
02:13:22,659 --> 02:13:23,140
Shoot.

2457
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:25,539
Maybe we can get a little crazy here.

2458
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:28,739
I've got several of these brushes.

2459
02:13:28,739 --> 02:13:29,859
Mine just doesn't do that.

2460
02:13:29,859 --> 02:13:30,260
Another one.

2461
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:31,460
Put a little touch.

2462
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:33,079
Not much.

2463
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:34,359
Little touch.

2464
02:13:34,359 --> 02:13:34,920
What color?

2465
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:36,039
Of alizarin crimson.

2466
02:13:37,399 --> 02:13:38,279
I think that's on the ground.

2467
02:13:40,090 --> 02:13:42,329
Just so it's not too bleak.

2468
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:46,569
Sometimes winter scenes can be very very depressing.

2469
02:13:47,289 --> 02:13:50,180
Put just a little pink in there.

2470
02:13:50,180 --> 02:13:53,130
Just to give it a little warmth in the background.

2471
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:55,189
This looks like shit.

2472
02:13:55,189 --> 02:13:55,909
I need my masher.

2473
02:13:55,909 --> 02:13:58,630
I still want to have a distinct winter taste to it.

2474
02:13:58,630 --> 02:14:04,010
Play some of that right down to the edge of that pink.

2475
02:14:06,899 --> 02:14:08,420
And that's basically all it takes.

2476
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:09,460
Is it?

2477
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:10,100
I did it.

2478
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:15,189
There a little bit and that's good enough.

2479
02:14:15,189 --> 02:14:18,149
That'll give us the sky that as I say it has a little life in it.

2480
02:14:18,149 --> 02:14:19,270
Some actions happening.

2481
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:21,029
It's not just a flat old dead sky.

2482
02:14:21,029 --> 02:14:24,229
You can see light areas and I like that in the sky.

2483
02:14:25,189 --> 02:14:27,000
Shoot that's working pretty good.

2484
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:29,079
Maybe we'll do the same thing down here.

2485
02:14:30,359 --> 02:14:30,600
Shit.

2486
02:14:32,710 --> 02:14:34,949
Anything that we don't use.

2487
02:14:36,630 --> 02:14:38,229
I should have done this in the beginning.

2488
02:14:38,229 --> 02:14:40,710
If this is a winter scene maybe we'll have some snow.

2489
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:42,310
You've got to have shadows in the snow.

2490
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:44,789
Or maybe it'll turn out to be water.

2491
02:14:45,590 --> 02:14:47,029
Who knows?

2492
02:14:47,029 --> 02:14:48,149
It doesn't matter.

2493
02:14:48,149 --> 02:14:48,869
I'm doing pretty well.

2494
02:14:48,869 --> 02:14:49,750
It doesn't matter.

2495
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:52,520
We can fix anything that can happen here.

2496
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:55,880
We don't concern ourselves with mistakes.

2497
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:57,079
We just have happier mistakes.

2498
02:14:57,079 --> 02:14:59,000
What a fucking unbelievable person.

2499
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,199
I love this guy.

2500
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:01,399
Bob Ross is incredible.

2501
02:15:03,619 --> 02:15:04,979
What a fucking joy of a human.

2502
02:15:04,979 --> 02:15:05,539
You know what I mean?

2503
02:15:05,539 --> 02:15:05,939
Seriously.

2504
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:08,340
I should have done this more often.

2505
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:10,500
I should do this like every fucking week.

2506
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:11,140
This feels good.

2507
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:19,979
It looks okay.

2508
02:15:20,789 --> 02:15:21,109
I don't know.

2509
02:15:21,109 --> 02:15:22,390
It's a little too much in the middle.

2510
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:24,899
Oh wait.

2511
02:15:36,279 --> 02:15:40,310
Black, Prussian blue, a little patch of crimson.

2512
02:15:40,949 --> 02:15:42,229
A patch of crimson.

2513
02:15:42,229 --> 02:15:42,630
Blue.

2514
02:15:42,630 --> 02:15:43,029
Crimson.

2515
02:15:43,029 --> 02:15:45,270
A little crimson and I'm going to get some white.

2516
02:15:45,270 --> 02:15:45,590
White.

2517
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:48,920
Just take a little bit of white.

2518
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:49,720
Okay.

2519
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:51,590
Mix up.

2520
02:15:51,590 --> 02:15:53,640
Put a little more blue in there.

2521
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:54,279
A little more blue.

2522
02:15:54,279 --> 02:15:55,000
Yeah.

2523
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:55,479
Yeah.

2524
02:15:55,479 --> 02:15:57,479
I want it to have sort of a blue cast to it.

2525
02:15:58,119 --> 02:15:58,760
That's good.

2526
02:15:58,760 --> 02:15:59,800
Oh, I like it.

2527
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:02,300
That's a good looking color.

2528
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:02,539
Okay.

2529
02:16:02,539 --> 02:16:03,180
Yeah.

2530
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:05,659
You just mix it until it gets to the flavor you like.

2531
02:16:05,659 --> 02:16:06,460
My flavor is...

2532
02:16:07,899 --> 02:16:09,689
It's sort of a drab.

2533
02:16:09,689 --> 02:16:11,770
Real bright.

2534
02:16:11,770 --> 02:16:13,930
Too much white?

2535
02:16:14,329 --> 02:16:22,619
Please old fanbrush today!

2536
02:16:22,619 --> 02:16:23,420
Yo look still...

2537
02:16:23,420 --> 02:16:32,329
See this color is not...

2538
02:16:32,329 --> 02:16:33,129
Wrong.

2539
02:16:33,129 --> 02:16:33,450
Wrong.

2540
02:16:33,450 --> 02:16:33,930
Wrong!

2541
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:34,170
Wrong!

2542
02:16:34,170 --> 02:16:34,809
Where's my paintbrush?

2543
02:16:34,809 --> 02:16:35,049
Wrong.

2544
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:37,049
Where's my paintbrush?

2545
02:16:37,049 --> 02:16:37,610
Wrong.

2546
02:16:37,610 --> 02:16:37,690
Wrong!

2547
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:38,329
Where's the paintbrush?

2548
02:16:38,329 --> 02:16:38,969
Wrong.

2549
02:16:38,969 --> 02:16:39,450
Where's the brush?

2550
02:16:39,450 --> 02:16:40,090
Where is it?

2551
02:16:40,090 --> 02:16:40,959
Where's the brush?

2552
02:16:41,670 --> 02:16:42,549
Where's my paintbrush?

2553
02:16:44,250 --> 02:16:45,690
Where is my paintbrush?

2554
02:16:45,690 --> 02:16:48,440
Where's my fucking paintbrush?

2555
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:49,319
Pretty close.

2556
02:16:49,319 --> 02:16:51,610
I'm going to pause this.

2557
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:58,180
Maybe it has a nice winter color.

2558
02:16:58,180 --> 02:16:58,819
Okay.

2559
02:16:58,819 --> 02:16:59,459
Pursed.

2560
02:16:59,459 --> 02:17:06,659
Where's my paintbrush?

2561
02:17:06,659 --> 02:17:10,899
Okay.

2562
02:17:10,899 --> 02:17:11,219
All right.

2563
02:17:12,149 --> 02:17:12,790
Good.

2564
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:27,670
so that needs to be this a little more crimson a little more blue a little more gray a little more

2565
02:17:27,670 --> 02:17:37,139
white i think we're there i think we're there here we go on pause i need black okay yeah black too

2566
02:17:37,139 --> 02:17:54,709
squish this down here black okay how's that look that's very wintery i think i got it a little

2567
02:17:54,709 --> 02:18:00,389
more there we go that's it that's the one right there that's it i got it that's the one i'm good

2568
02:18:00,469 --> 02:18:10,569
let's go let's grab an old brush an old brush full of color where's it going

2569
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:20,200
maybe in our world back here i don't know where it's going somewhere see this color is not

2570
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:30,500
but it's already on the canvas let's push upward today and make us a little tree it's pretty close

2571
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:43,620
to the color it's on the canvas and that's what we're looking for i don't want it too much right

2572
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:49,770
there and you decide how many trees live in your world it's up to you totally well i only did one

2573
02:18:50,489 --> 02:18:56,620
as you've probably heard me say before to me that's what's so fantastic about painting

2574
02:18:57,340 --> 02:19:01,540
is that each and every person will paint differently and that's what makes it special

2575
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:07,139
if we all painted the same way what a boring time it would be see yeah that's right you would know

2576
02:19:07,139 --> 02:19:12,100
what the finished painting was going to be before you start that's right he's right because people

2577
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:19,670
are different paintings are different it's the beauty of it it really is makes it very special

2578
02:19:19,670 --> 02:19:32,579
allows you to to show your individuality the trees do we want here it's up to you you decide

2579
02:19:32,579 --> 02:19:40,469
you decide maybe like five you just want a few maybe just a little baby one right there

2580
02:19:40,469 --> 02:19:45,690
he's not so big yet make up little stories you know people look at you like you're a little

2581
02:19:45,690 --> 02:19:51,690
strange but that's all right painters are expected to be different i love bob ross

2582
02:19:51,690 --> 02:20:03,940
it's trees i thought i don't have a real paintbrush

2583
02:20:07,530 --> 02:20:11,850
what the fuck is that thing i've missed down here at the base of this

2584
02:20:12,409 --> 02:20:18,579
yes so just by tapping we're just going to softly softly disappear over here

2585
02:20:19,299 --> 02:20:23,829
we used to just sort of look like we're just sitting in a little misty area

2586
02:20:24,790 --> 02:20:42,440
just breathing in the cold air i fixed it very misty cold looking and already you had the

2587
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:50,020
impression of winter mine looks like a forest of burnt down this doesn't look like clean

2588
02:20:55,739 --> 02:21:05,209
now the paint snow with a two inch brush very easy loaded full of color which is white and we have

2589
02:21:05,209 --> 02:21:12,139
we already have this gray color on the canvas we put on and talked about it being shadow now

2590
02:21:12,139 --> 02:21:18,059
it's gonna pick that up see there we just let it sort of disappear over here we don't care

2591
02:21:20,229 --> 02:21:30,219
fuck wrong way that easy fantastic why are you doing that snow is one of the easier things to

2592
02:21:30,219 --> 02:21:39,510
paint in this technique okay you ready for a little a little fun today maybe tell you what

2593
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:43,750
we filmed the show in indiana and there's a there's a lot of old barns here that just

2594
02:21:44,629 --> 02:21:48,709
let's paint an old barn today barn in there one of the easiest ways is to take

2595
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:55,350
scrapes out of basic shape just where's my scraping tool where's my scraper exact and

2596
02:21:55,350 --> 02:22:01,579
you're not where's the fucking scraper committed here i'm actually using this the whole time

2597
02:22:01,579 --> 02:22:12,840
decide what comes down like yeah it has a place over here for the cow to sleep you decide barns

2598
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:19,129
come in all kinds of shapes where's the scraper farmers are like painters they they do it their

2599
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:28,659
way wait stop stop stop stop pause it that's so great about being a fantastic

2600
02:22:28,659 --> 02:22:36,700
that looks so good okay pause it where's the scraper can somebody help me out here where's

2601
02:22:36,700 --> 02:23:01,209
the scraper behind you on the table where is it this is a dora moment i don't know where it is i

2602
02:23:01,209 --> 02:23:11,700
threw it a long time ago i've whipped it across the room a very long time ago and this place is

2603
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:22,059
filthy so i have no idea where the scraper is here is it you're throwing for views i don't know

2604
02:23:22,059 --> 02:23:46,250
where the scraping tool is does anybody see the scraping tool does this work it's under the

2605
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:53,899
elevator wait see what do you mean under the elevator what the fuck am i going to do this

2606
02:23:53,899 --> 02:24:23,690
little scraping tool it's near the spoon i just saw it big canvas left corner i don't think it's

2607
02:24:23,690 --> 02:24:38,760
even still here can i get another one i looked right at it did i under the lift you mean under

2608
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:48,889
this there it is all right i got my scraping tool i'm good all right bob what are we doing

2609
02:24:49,450 --> 02:24:57,959
let's do it snow is one of the easier things to paint in this technique okay you ready for a

2610
02:24:57,959 --> 02:25:04,200
little a little fun today let's go tell you what we filmed the show in indiana and there's a

2611
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:10,260
there's a lot of old barns here that just fascinate me let's paint an old barn today one of the

2612
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:16,899
easiest ways is to take a scrape out a basic shape just sort of scrape it out it doesn't have to be

2613
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:25,590
and you're not committed you're not committed here so let's just decide what kind of old barn

2614
02:25:25,590 --> 02:25:31,989
we want maybe it comes down like that maybe it has a place over here for the cow to sleep

2615
02:25:33,270 --> 02:25:41,219
it doesn't matter you decide this is just a figured tree all right i made it a perspective

2616
02:25:41,620 --> 02:26:04,569
their way great about being a fantastic country sorry the other side about the same distance here

2617
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:11,670
but just scrape out i hope you can see there's just a basic basic that thing sucks and as i

2618
02:26:11,670 --> 02:26:16,870
mentioned earlier you are not committed bandak brown dark sienna you can change your mind at

2619
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:25,399
this point a little roll of paint now let's begin picking out the little thing there's the the back

2620
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:27,000
i didn't paint it

2621
02:27:04,059 --> 02:27:28,940
me too i do that i do i got that's take let's take let's take some white arc sienna

2622
02:27:31,610 --> 02:27:38,309
uh a little band i can i wasn't done a little crimson too what the heck uh give it a little

2623
02:27:38,309 --> 02:27:46,229
warm feeling don't over mix the paint off a little roll of paint then we can go up in here

2624
02:27:46,229 --> 02:27:52,149
shit and just barely touch just let it graze see let it graze looks like old old wood

2625
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:58,709
if you painted barns and cabins and stuff what happened here what happened to mine

2626
02:27:59,750 --> 02:28:08,840
antique glass for example when you get my age you have a tendency to like

2627
02:28:09,639 --> 02:28:17,610
you can relate to them i need a thinner brush it's this it's not going to work it's not going to

2628
02:28:17,610 --> 02:28:28,459
work let's take a little bandage whether it's darker on the side because maybe not as much

2629
02:28:28,459 --> 02:28:36,250
light is going to hit over here see that's much darker now that some boards in there for that

2630
02:28:36,250 --> 02:28:40,889
we'll just take some bandag brown i need a thicker brush but i need a thinner brush it's too thin but

2631
02:28:40,889 --> 02:28:51,370
it's too thick raid song what what happened who raided another fucking monster raid who raided

2632
02:28:51,370 --> 02:29:03,940
i came to see what's up coney thanks for the raid welcome everybody shit low to you what's

2633
02:29:03,940 --> 02:29:14,139
going on coney coney am i saying this wrong i'm saying this wrong oh my god i'm such a shithead

2634
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:25,989
i got it i got it i got it well thank you welcome guys today we're uh we you get a nice straight

2635
02:29:25,989 --> 02:29:29,670
edge i guess i don't even do i have to explain what's happening i mean i think this is very

2636
02:29:29,670 --> 02:29:34,069
clear that i'm just this is just a complete bogus this is not working well uh but thanks

2637
02:29:34,069 --> 02:29:39,540
to the very welcome guys hope you had a good stream if what happened there's no paint on this

2638
02:29:39,540 --> 02:30:03,799
this actually looks not this just looks off this it's very bad this is very bad happy accidents

2639
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:11,059
well what happens when they're all accidents what happens if you only have accidents so you have a

2640
02:30:11,059 --> 02:30:21,129
nice straight edge i need purple there and i need white up here straight edge this looks like an old

2641
02:30:21,129 --> 02:30:25,290
book this is like an old shitty tomb that you found in like your grandfather's attic

2642
02:30:26,170 --> 02:30:29,340
there's like a bunch of spells in this i i don't know what to do about this

2643
02:30:29,899 --> 02:30:36,340
but you can just move it anyway that you i fucked up this angle i don't know how all right we need

2644
02:30:36,340 --> 02:30:42,540
a door oh cal's gotta have a way to get in and out there let's take some bandage decide where

2645
02:30:42,540 --> 02:30:48,899
your door lives and once again don't worry about the bottom we're gonna do we're gonna do a barn

2646
02:30:49,459 --> 02:30:58,389
as i mentioned earlier okay uh wherever we wanted to be i need a door which is about time to do now

2647
02:30:58,389 --> 02:31:10,620
let's say the old barn take too much cutting on that but sometimes i paint that's that's that's

2648
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:28,329
salad fingers house that's who that's who lives there okay um what do i do now wait he's little

2649
02:31:28,329 --> 02:31:49,350
like uh speckles down here on it on the snow you know what they say about it i gotta pat it over

2650
02:31:49,350 --> 02:31:59,500
here on the other side we'll just bring it when in doubt just like mush this fucking thing down

2651
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:07,620
and it looks kind of like you did it on purpose snow is so easy to paint i actually don't like

2652
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:21,079
this so this actually i don't this doesn't look that bad actually now i look at it gotta have a

2653
02:32:21,079 --> 02:32:31,770
big big what's he doing very very helpful most is important is having what is having easel that

2654
02:32:31,770 --> 02:32:39,350
holds your paint you're okay you're painting you're gonna cough your sneeze you really need

2655
02:32:39,350 --> 02:32:46,520
you all right okay you're okay you're just going like he's supposed to like sneeze or cough

2656
02:32:47,399 --> 02:32:58,659
you're good he's okay missed it what happened little crimson little crimson in there what he

2657
02:32:58,659 --> 02:33:11,959
just do maybe right here when you paint just a little bit pretty soon you begin to get a feel

2658
02:33:11,959 --> 02:33:16,520
for it when it touches if it don't want to pull just right then you can add a little that's not

2659
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:24,520
lightning i just knew the paint wasn't going to cover us unless i did i guess it got be darker

2660
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:31,479
have a happy little tree he lives right there darker little guy darker on the side the barn

2661
02:33:31,479 --> 02:33:45,020
go the other side over here you know me here we go bigger tree big old tree so much fun to make

2662
02:33:45,020 --> 02:33:51,290
they're very simple very simple takes a little practice like everything else everything in your

2663
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:56,709
life takes a little practice and mine looks pretty good this technique faster than any painting

2664
02:33:56,709 --> 02:34:04,899
technique that i have ever seen fuck out of the way i think i've tried just about all of them wells

2665
02:34:04,899 --> 02:34:13,989
are so forgiving what am i what am i painting with acrylic i know what that is i think that's

2666
02:34:13,989 --> 02:34:25,059
why the old masters painted mostly in oils they just have a richness mediums to me are very flat

2667
02:34:25,059 --> 02:34:35,190
when they're dry and they're harder this is the easiest because it's very forgiving you can't

2668
02:34:35,190 --> 02:34:42,860
make a mistake here all right let's take let's take some of that nice gray color we had

2669
02:34:44,409 --> 02:34:48,010
this don't look half bad now there's a bunch of trees that covering all the shitty things i did

2670
02:34:48,010 --> 02:35:09,420
maybe there's a little just work way out here oh shit when in doubt mash it on our little ever

2671
02:35:09,420 --> 02:35:30,950
drink titanium white i changed the blue i've been using titanium white liquid white and titanium

2672
02:35:30,950 --> 02:35:45,979
blue whatever that was this is a blue spruce i just made a decision command level decision

2673
02:35:45,979 --> 02:36:02,229
right here that looks really really good not mine but his omega l command focus on your face what

2674
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:09,959
to decide which trees in the foreground make the small one here is so you do the one

2675
02:36:09,959 --> 02:36:23,579
what oh my god what actually good what is good and did a little tree over here

2676
02:36:23,579 --> 02:36:41,379
somebody just made this this is this is good that's pretty good that's really good nice job

2677
02:36:43,479 --> 02:37:34,250
is the other you need to click then click this link what the fuck not edited oh my fucking god

2678
02:37:49,079 --> 02:38:27,030
hmm okay let's go keep going i only got like five minutes left oh it's like saw it don't take it

2679
02:38:27,030 --> 02:38:59,129
off it's nice and frosty titanium white this is gonna ruin it yep winter seems a lot it

2680
02:38:59,129 --> 02:39:07,850
might be the easiest ones to do fucking hell yeah what do you got here and we just blend that a

2681
02:39:07,850 --> 02:39:15,510
little bit until it looks nice and soft all right let's go in this little tree over here

2682
02:39:16,979 --> 02:39:23,209
i'm intentionally grabbing some of that dark color see we'll put him up on a little hill

2683
02:39:24,250 --> 02:39:29,049
that easy that's not gonna be white right he sort of sits up high isn't that neat but just

2684
02:39:29,049 --> 02:39:35,000
by pulling some of that color that you can create that illusion believable to have this kind of

2685
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:56,940
power it's a blustery day you just decide like that i like it right there right there my path

2686
02:39:56,940 --> 02:40:13,639
is fine you can just go back and this until it gets just what we consider perfect for the roof

2687
02:40:13,639 --> 02:40:20,340
and sometimes it's nice to just pop in a little duder here what do you say open in one

2688
02:40:29,079 --> 02:40:35,000
you decide you decide where they are but you have little patches of bushes and sticks and wigs

2689
02:40:36,229 --> 02:40:45,750
limbs and twigs that go everywhere what is the same brush ready to get crazy let's take some

2690
02:40:45,750 --> 02:40:51,370
van dyke brown and i brown mostly van dyke brown mostly van dyke brown do i have van dyke brown

2691
02:40:51,930 --> 02:40:56,729
i don't have brown brown does not a color here what is this we're gonna make it

2692
02:40:57,770 --> 02:41:06,700
all right we're gonna make van dyke brown is that van dyke brown is this van dyke brown okay let's

2693
02:41:06,700 --> 02:41:21,750
give him a friend let's give him a friend maybe this is an old birch tree it lives out here it's

2694
02:41:21,750 --> 02:41:42,299
up to you oh why did that fucking happen i got actually visibly mad about that this is the 31st

2695
02:41:42,299 --> 02:41:57,100

02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:23,940
give your station a call they're available to them they're available to them or if you want to see
