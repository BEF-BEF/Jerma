00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:15,189
Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with a sorcery exclamation mark gameplay commentary and before don't this is a text-based adventure type game

2
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:18,230
Don't nobody freak out. I just want to let you know beforehand

3
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:24,289
This is not like a hack and slash a party up and like throw fireballs at people that you kind of do

4
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,010
But it's very slow. It's very deliberate. It's a game to lie down and relax and play in bed

5
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:35,250
It's got like hundreds of thousands of words. So if you don't like reading

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,250
Wait a second. It's a fantasy world. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book

7
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,869
Just calm down for a second just chill out. Okay. No, it's a fun game. Trust me. You just have to sit

8
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:59,280
Okay, so sorcery is

9
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:08,219
Like I said previously a text-based adventure game where your choices and your paps can lead to different conclusions

10
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,700
And it's based on a series of game books by Steve Jackson

11
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,620
Which is why it's called Steve Jackson sorcery and it's a whole lot of fun for the longest time

12
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,060
I've been saying to myself man

13
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:25,700
I wish they would bring back the choose-your-own-adventure books or the game books from back in like the 80s in the early 90s

14
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,099
Who remembers the old goosebump books? Remember those old like goose by?

15
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,819
There was one it was like a carnival and there were multiple ways you could die

16
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,939
Multiple ways you could escape and it was a ton of fun when I was a teenager sitting down lying in my bed

17
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,620
Flipping through these books. It was exciting because you never knew if the decision you were gonna make was gonna be the right one

18
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,060
Or will it be the wrong one? And is this way you die?

19
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,569
That feeling made me want to read

20
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:58,049
It made me want to pick up another one of these books and fine and try my luck at how far I can get in this

21
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,290
Susparner

22
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:07,049
That was cool back in the day and now it seems like this company Inkle who is the the group responsible for

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,210
Porting Steve Jackson series over to iOS and Android

24
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:17,509
They're doing a great job and it's fun to see them actually do this and then try to revitalize this old platform

25
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:23,629
That has sort of fallen off the beaten path in the last 15 20 years or so

26
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:30,050
But the way the game actually plays is sort of a good condensed version of the old books

27
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:37,349
There is an entire spell casting system with dozens of spells in this game that you can cast in a million different

28
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:41,750
Situations and see how they all turn out and there's a combat system as well

29
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,849
There is an actual sword play system over the course of your travels

30
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:52,669
You're going to encounter people like this guy that are pretty strong. You'll also encounter pretty weak enemies as well

31
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,430
They're not all as difficult and powerful as this guy, but it's a tug-of-war system, right?

32
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,349
So if I swing my sword harder than he does

33
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,750
I'm going to do the damage to him and vice versa. We have stamina meters

34
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,310
So you don't want to drain all your stamina in one swing which will then force you to defend and when you defend you are

35
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:16,590
Guaranteed to take one point of damage if the other enemy decides to swing at you

36
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,669
so you really want to play the cat-and-mouse game you want to play the tug-of-war game and

37
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,370
Try to keep your stamina above zero because when it hits zero you die

38
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,199
But regardless of any of this it spices up

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:36,099
What could just be a typical text adventure and Inkle has done an amazing job at making this not just feel like I'm reading a book and

40
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,020
Choosing little choices and reading the outcomes. I actually feel like I'm part of this little game world

41
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,740
It's like a board game the way you move your character around the map

42
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:50,939
It's a huge detailed world that you actually get to move around and then read about where you just went

43
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:57,039
And this is book two of the sorcery series. There is four books. There is four books

44
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,599
that's full, but there are four books in this series and

45
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:07,039
Episode three or part three should be coming out within the next I don't know

46
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,439
I know this just recently came out last year

47
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,080
So I don't want to like throw the developers under the bus and be like yeah sorcery three will come out in March of

48
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,439
2015 no, I don't know all I know is that they're working on it

49
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:21,000
They just released a new game not that long ago

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,079
So they're probably in between projects, but I would say pick up both of them if you like this kind of thing

51
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,199
It's gonna cost you

52
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,160
$3 for sorcery one the first part of the adventure and

53
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,240
five bucks for sorcery two

54
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,040
Eight bucks for the whole thing the whole experience so far

55
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,040
Depending on how many times you play through it and try to get all the different items and all the different weapons and all the

56
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,439
Scenarios to play out. It's probably gonna take you quite some time

57
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:54,290
I don't really want to put a hour number on it because you I don't want to put that in your head

58
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,810
I don't want to say oh the game will take you three and a half hours because you then you you're thinking about that

59
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,209
You're not engrossed in the story

60
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:04,569
It's gonna vary for every single person how long it takes them to play through their first time

61
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:08,170
Because some people will do some stuff very quickly other people will be going

62
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,170
Sort of around in a circle and trying to find a way it's it's a lot

63
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:18,730
It's different for everybody and it's enjoyable. Nonetheless, however, you play through it eight bucks again. It's on Android

64
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,730
It's on the app store links will be in the description if you want to check it out check it out

65
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,310
That's gonna wrap up the video guys. Thank you so much for watching really do appreciate it. I'll take y'all every day. That's a fair

66
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,600
Everybody take care
