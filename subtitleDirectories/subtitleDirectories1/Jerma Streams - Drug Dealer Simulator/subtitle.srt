5
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:01,030
What's going on, guys? Welcome to the stream. It's me, Germo. Just getting you, hitting you up.

6
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,829
See if you're ready to go. If you're ready to go, then give me a call back whenever you get the

7
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:11,189
chance. Although I'm live right now, so you ain't gonna get the chance because this is it. Today

8
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:18,650
we're gonna play... Well, we had a little bit of a pre-stream issue, and what I mean by that is today

9
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:27,290
we're gonna potentially play Toontown Reloaded, but it turns out it was... Not that it was hard

10
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:34,950
to set up, but I wanted to see if it was possible to do a different server or set it up in a way

11
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,030
where I could actually play Toontown, and it turns out no, I can't. So we're gonna do, instead of

12
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,109
Toontown today, we're... I'm not gonna eat a ghost pepper. What the fuck are you talking about?

13
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,590
Eat a ghost pepper. No, not that I couldn't be bothered to. Listen, all right, you're distracting

14
00:01:51,590 --> 00:02:00,730
me. So I'm gonna do MMO Grab Bag 2, because I've seen a lot of people write stuff like,

15
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,370
dude, you should play City of Heroes. Dude, you're champions online. Let's all dump into Roblox.

16
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:13,210
Let's all play RuneScape. And I'm just like, eh, eh, eh, eh. Toontown. So we're gonna do

17
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:23,139
a MMO Grab Bag 2. Did one before. Toontown will be part of that. It's just not gonna be today.

18
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:37,379
Because every one of these is all gonna go the same way. I'm gonna get in the game, and there's

19
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:46,439
gonna be like 500 people. All of you are gonna try to push me into the ocean. And, you know, after

20
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:52,520
about 20, 30 minutes of that, how many times can we get me pushed into the ocean? Or too many names

21
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,460
on the screen so I can't attack or tag the enemy or touch the quest giver? You know, how many times

22
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,020
can we do that in Toontown before? It's always funny though. Yeah, I know it. But we have to...

23
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,699
When will I do this? When am I gonna play Toontown? All right, so here's the deal.

24
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:25,909
Okay, the guy that plans nothing is about to give you a plan. Okay. Wednesday is public domain movie

25
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:31,990
night. Thursday is community content night. Friday is mystery game night. Saturday is the

26
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:43,460
Easy Bay government stream. After that, somewhere probably around Tuesday or Wednesday, Wednesday

27
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:54,710
the 29th, we will try to do MMO Grab Bag 2. I'm still waiting for Doom. Me too. It keeps getting...

28
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,930
I'm never gonna play it. It's not gonna happen. I'm just gonna be completely real with myself.

29
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:07,509
I don't think I'm ever gonna play Doom Eternal. Anyways, today we're gonna do drugs.

30
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,879
Fake drugs? Because after it turned out the Toontown was not gonna really work out,

31
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:21,639
we were like, hey, but what about like a stocks simulator? That'd be fun. So we looked up a bunch

32
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,439
of stocks games and some of them for DOS, some of them for like regular Nintendo, and they were

33
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:33,000
kind of all ass. And I was like, wait a minute. Isn't this drug game is stocks, right? It's just

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,720
stocks but drugs. Like, okay. Drug dealing stock simulator. But I did find a good stocks game.

35
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:57,610
We're gonna play it. It's not today. And here we go. I only gave $50. I got it loaded and ready.

36
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:07,060
You can hear it though. The chef's corner just gave 5,000 bits. Thank you. Chef's corner.

37
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:14,819
Hello there, Mr. Elverton. Thank you so much for the entertainment you provided me in the last

38
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:20,259
few years. But a long few years for me, for sure, mid-20s are apparently always hard.

39
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,660
Anyway, love you and hope auto gets well soon. Also, please peek your microphone. I can't. I

40
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,819
have a compressor on. See, I'm, you guys didn't even know that I had one now. New office, new

41
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:38,939
compressor. I can't even peek it. It's not possible. It'll, if I, when I go, it's just gonna go,

42
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,470
try it. No, I don't want to, you can break a fucking microphone that way. I know a lot of

43
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,269
you guys think it's like funny when people like scream into their microphones. I do too. Everybody

44
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:57,670
does. But if you have a microphone, if you have like a nice microphone, you can damage the insides.

45
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:09,420
It's got the, it's like a light bulb in there. You get to, it can break. Loud is funny. Child

46
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:16,550
humor. It's not even that funny. Okay. But it is. It's not. But that means screaming is kind of

47
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:25,259
funny. You can't tell me that like a scream isn't funny in some places. Screaming at a light bulb

48
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,420
will break it. That don't, I'm saying that just be careful with your shit. Okay. This is drug

49
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,709
dealer simulator. We're going to play the stock market except it's drugs. Thank you chef's corner

50
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:45,160
for the fucking insane 5,000 bit drop. Thanks for the $50. And Otto is doing very well. He's,

51
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,759
I think he's pretty much better, but he has an appointment to make sure of it. Can you hear this?

52
00:06:51,779 --> 00:07:13,819
And I hear this and I hear this. Why can I not hear this? Why is it silent? Um, hold on.

53
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:21,529
Just don't set that too low. Why can I not hear this though? I'm kind of important. You know,

54
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:28,569
I mean, my voice is for, you know, I could make this not happen. I don't know how to do that.

55
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:31,529
Wait, this is, this is a setting on the go XLR. I don't know how to fix.

56
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,329
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't know. Hold on.

57
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:54,980
Um, hold on. Yeah, that's better. No, just leave it. Nope. Didn't work. Hold on. What's this do?

58
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:08,550
Oh my God. You're one of those guys. I don't know how to do this.

59
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,990
That's why is it coming through my mic? Why is my desktop audio coming through my mic?

60
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:26,089
Why did it be this one? Wait a minute. Hold on. Let me see. What does that do?

61
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:37,529
Oh, for fuck's sake. Okay. Now you're just fooling around. Um, how do, what, what's, does that work?

62
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:43,779
You're fooling around. How does this work? I don't understand how this works. Blah, blah.

63
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,340
Why is it coming through? Why is this coming through? I'm not, this is not me making a fucking

64
00:08:48,340 --> 00:09:01,850
joke. Why is this coming through? Why is this bleeding through? My microphone is a mic. Is this

65
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:24,200
my mic? Desktop audio system. Blah, blah, blah. Now I can't hear it because it's muting my microphone.

66
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:36,500
Can I not just capture the mic from the GoXLR? Why is this happening now? This didn't happen

67
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:48,149
yesterday. What the fuck? Stop this. I'm not joking. I'm telling you. Thanks for the money,

68
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:58,139
by the way. Hey, thanks for the $50, $10, $5. Um, I have to like unplug this and plug it into

69
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:10,059
something else. This is fucking stupid. If I turn this louder, uh, blah, blah, blah. This is fucking

70
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:18,169
annoying. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got it. I

71
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:52,340
got it. Nobody. Why can nobody hear me now? This motherfucker. I swear to God. All right. I think

72
00:10:52,340 --> 00:11:08,779
it's done. Why can you not hear this now? You now cannot hear the audio. What the fuck? Okay. It's

73
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:14,389
just going to have to stay like that. Can you hear both at the same time?

74
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:26,259
Okay. It's coming through. That's apparently coming through my microphone, by the way,

75
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:33,539
just in case anybody was aware. I was curious. Those sounds are coming through the microphone

76
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:45,269
input. What a dumb fucking hardware. I have no idea why the fuck that would ever be happening.

77
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,500
All right. Anyways, uh, we can turn it up a little though.

78
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:06,259
Just don't set that too low. Okay. Uh, I've, I don't know why I go XLR. I'm not going to say

79
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:12,460
anything fucking. I'm not going to say anything. I'm not going to die. I'm, I'm, I'm angry at the

80
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:28,460
stupid fucking. All right. I'm done. Let's go. All right. Where's my, uh, where's, where's the

81
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:40,090
fucking, I don't even know. Let's go. Why is the door locked? The ancient enemies of short term

82
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:45,370
memory. Yesterday, you got so fucked up that even I forgot where the keys are.

83
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,659
Wait, is this me talking to me? Why is it motion blur? This shit should be off.

84
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:58,309
Search the apartment. You gotta be here somewhere. Dude, fucking weed. I know it's unbelievable.

85
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:08,440
I can't use the workstation. All right. Where are the keys? Is there a flashlight

86
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,809
or in the game up? It's all right. Streams not on yet. Streams not on yet. I'll be right back.

87
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:17,659
All right. It worked. All right. I fixed it. Starting the stream again. All right. We're good.

88
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:21,580
We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Dumbest fucking thing I've ever done in my life.

89
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:33,450
All right. Let's find the keys. That's a real crack stream now. Okay. So I have to find my

90
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:41,460
keys. Tasks available. Let's see. I have a quest log. Q just like nods my head. Okay. That was,

91
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:48,100
that was a great comedy bit called drop, kick the go XLR out the window. Fuck. No, it's a good

92
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,139
pro. It's okay. I like it. It works. I just, for some reason it was stupid today. God damn it.

93
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,500
No one will ever fucking like me. I'll never have any friends. All right. Let's go. Let's go. How do

94
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:18,419
I leave? Where are the keys? There it is. I found it. Why is this like pub G? All right. I just got

95
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:26,789
money. Why do I have like a pub G backpack? I thought 50 more dollars came in during my fucking

96
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:39,620
like temper tantrum. Uh, Toby, Toby four two seven. Thanks for the fucking $50. That's 50 exp

97
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:45,049
and $50 at the same time. Thanks a lot for the 50 fucking bucks. They say,

98
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:49,690
Jeremiah, I live in the UK. So it's hardly very, I can't get the chance to catch a stream.

99
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,419
I've been a huge fan for nearly seven years. I feel like donating was long overdue. Don't worry

100
00:15:55,419 --> 00:16:00,139
about that. You don't ever have to feel obligated to give me a scent of your hard earned cash

101
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:08,899
train coming through the fucking house. Wait, what? Uh, thank you for the many years of laughs

102
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:13,580
you've given me. Thank you for the many dollars you just gave me. Thanks for being around for

103
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:22,360
seven years, dude. Really appreciate it. Thanks to both you chef corner and Toby. Enjoy the crew

104
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:38,519
review. I can leave now. All right, let's go. Is there a car? Is this automatic one letter grid?

105
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:48,659
Where are we? Okay. I have to go in there. The tires of the smell of tires in the morning.

106
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:55,220
Why is this game postal to but a different game? Okay. Um, I need to go to meet Eddie.

107
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:08,539
There's a jump. He's just a parkour button. Why is there parkour? I thought it was like a stocks

108
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:19,079
game. Is Eddie sit down? I'll brief you up. Okay. Eddie, how do I want to do? So I'm gonna just

109
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:30,579
stocks and I heard drugs are like stocks. Um, no, thank you. You know what? Sometimes when I get

110
00:17:30,579 --> 00:17:35,380
these so called second thought kind of thing, he's a square. What?

111
00:17:52,380 --> 00:18:01,480
How was the party? Um, I was crazy. Yeah, you young motherfuckers tend to do nowadays. I'd be

112
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,009
fucked up big time for a week if I party that on one evening. Well, okay. Anyway,

113
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:13,450
I thought that was a cloud. It's like, it's like poison. Listen up. I'm your main. I was like,

114
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,539
Oh, nice clouds in the cartel. Anything and everything. Considering the business in and

115
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:23,579
out dialogue up by little from now on. I'm your daddy, your boss, your fucking wife,

116
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:29,579
all in one person. Okay. You need dope. You write to me. You got the cash for the cartel.

117
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:35,099
I take it. You shit your pants. I need to know before you change your underwear straight forward.

118
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:45,049
Why? Well, Eddie, um, just want to let you know, grab them, go home and get your laptop.

119
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:51,079
There'll be clients writing you soon. You make them sales and I'll get back to you soon after

120
00:18:51,079 --> 00:19:01,460
questions. Uh, I do drug sales through a laptop, encrypted app cartels in the 21st century. Now,

121
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:16,230
baby, totally safe. Uh, excuse me. Are we using any protection and security? Eddie,

122
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,079
you're going to smoke that or you're going to let it just burn? All right. Um, was it,

123
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:28,839
what's a dead drop? What a police, what a police officer I am. Eddie, what's the, uh, dead drop?

124
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,400
What do the kids call that these days? Like a new tick tock dance or something. What is that?

125
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:43,220
Eddie, a dead drop. I know what it is. Uh, do you know what it is? How do I get off the bench? Oh,

126
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:49,460
yo, you're going to explain to me what the fuck just

127
00:19:49,460 --> 00:20:02,549
frack. There's a bird stuck on the wire. How do I get up there and release him?

128
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:12,759
No, he's stuck. Let me turn the volume up. Just don't set that too low. Okay. I don't like having

129
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:19,529
loud music. It hurts my ears. Okay. So the task now is go to get the first pack. All right. Let's

130
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:39,450
get our first package. Where is it? There's already, there's already police here. There it is.

131
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:51,000
Three gram pack of marijuana, popular and light smoked drug. Okay. Items held too long in public

132
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:01,029
containers may end up stolen. How do I pick it up? I've G pack of amphetamines. How do I get them?

133
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:09,400
Oh, like that. Okay. I've got them. All right. Now go back home and get to the computer.

134
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,730
Your first client should be messaging you any moment now. You'll get notifications on new

135
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,609
messages on your phone, but to read them, you'll need the encrypted app on the laptop.

136
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:33,880
What is going on? Okay. You need to, it's from Eddie. Eddie, how do I answer your phone call?

137
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:41,140
Read messages, left mouse button, Q and E is swipe. All right. Miss call from Eddie. Can I call Eddie

138
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:51,299
back? Why can I call Eddie back? All right. I'm going to go back home and use the laptop.

139
00:21:54,039 --> 00:22:08,660
That's not a missed call. Wait, am I on call? Am I on the call right now? What is this stuff?

140
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:24,019
But where, how did this get in the road? It's a monolith. All right. This is my house, right?

141
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:36,279
Okay. I go over and use the laptop and then sell the drugs. Well, that's not my house.

142
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:50,630
Where's my house? There it is. Okay. Now use the laptop. Can I cook food? Okay. That's a,

143
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:59,750
that's a, that's not a laptop. That's a microwave. Where's the laptop? Or clean that window. Oh,

144
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:05,660
that's a mirror. That mirror is destroyed. I have a nice house tour. This is a new house tour.

145
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:24,470
Where's my laptop? Do I even have a laptop? Where's my laptop? Wait, hold, check. That's

146
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:31,980
not a laptop. That's a laptop. Okay. This is Shadycon, a special, fancy, dark web

147
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,380
communicator. Stocks, stocks, stocks, stocks. This is where you order the merchandise from Eddie.

148
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,420
And this is where your clients will contact you. Okay. It also has other options, but

149
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,500
we'll get to that in time. Why are there, why are there three dogs? Why are there animals buying

150
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,779
drugs? Okay. So we have Leon. Yo, you have three grams of weed. Would like to buy some.

151
00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:03,779
You expect high quality. How much, what do I have for drugs? I have five grams of marijuana. I can

152
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:10,279
sell it for $10. I have seven grams of amphetamines. All right. What does Donald want? I need three

153
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:16,920
grams of weed. You have some. Hey, yo, you still got stock. 5G would be awesome. All right. 5G of

154
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:28,539
what? What about what? Sale price. That's $10 a gram. That's correct. What do you mean? All right.

155
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:33,740
You have three grams of weed? Yeah, sure. All right. Yeah. I got it. On the way. Have cash ready.

156
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,059
Hey there. You still got speed and stock. Oh, that's right. Okay. Yeah. I got that.

157
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,700
All right. I'll deliver to you soon. I don't have any more weed though. How much weed do I have?

158
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:58,440
I don't have enough. Do I? What do I see how much I have? Yeah. What do you mean? I don't have speed.

159
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:08,460
That's amphetamine. What do you mean? I have amphetamines. That's what speed is.

160
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:14,140
What are you guys talking about? Speed is amphetamine. You guys, you guys don't know

161
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:28,440
anything about drugs? What are you doing here? I took, I've taken drug classes to find out like

162
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,759
how to determine. I've, you know, there was a programs to tell us about how dangerous this

163
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:40,299
shit was. I know what this stuff is. Are you going to order? Oh, I can order drugs on Shady

164
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,990
comp as well. Communicate with your clients. Choose a person on the contact list and click

165
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:49,000
the chat input field for options. Clients will show on the map, find them and deliver the packages.

166
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,250
Okay. All right. So let's see, where are they? All right. Emma, deliver five grams of amphetamine.

167
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:08,359
Let's go right there. That's right here. That's the bathroom. Close the door though.

168
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:19,049
Let's deliver. Oh, why is the door? I'm on drugs apparently. Oh wait, no, that's the bathroom.

169
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:27,140
How do I leave? No, that's not the exit. That's another tenant. Okay. Uh, Emma's over here. Do I

170
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,880
need to be able to have protection? Like should I have, should I pick up like a wrench or something?

171
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:44,940
Like what if they, what if I get attacked? All right. Where's Emma? Why climb the barbed wire

172
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:56,230
fence? Okay. Emma, finally here. Got the stuff. Yeah, here it is. Um, five pack of amphetamine is

173
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:08,170
what she wanted, right? Okay. Drugs expected it. Drugs got, okay. I got a hundred respect and $50.

174
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:14,250
Did I tell you backpacks have downsides as well? The bigger the backpack, the slower you run

175
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:21,849
and more suspicious you may appear to the police. This is going to turn into death stranding. Now

176
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:28,950
that's your problem. Imagine having like 50 different suitcases all over me. Okay. So now

177
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,559
I have 50. Oh, I have, I actually hold the money. What if I just like throw it in the air?

178
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:49,859
Okay. Marijuana. Where's uh, Leon's over here. Drugs stranding. Yeah. Hey, what's up Leon?

179
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:59,529
You finally got the stuff. Yup. Here it is. What does he want? Three grams. Okay. I want to give

180
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:07,990
him one. No, no, no, no, no. You're not getting, you're not getting two for one. How do I, I only

181
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:18,329
want to give you one of these. That's a three. I almost gave him six grams. $36. Thanks a lot.

182
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:34,380
Okay. More respect. Meth stranding. Okay. I did it. The night, the drug store, the sewage treatment.

183
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:43,769
This looks like a lot of stuff going on in this game. All right. Let's keep going. I'm going to

184
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:55,930
go get another order, which I checked. Hold on. New message from what do you mean? There's no new

185
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:12,230
message here. Why is it lying to me? There's no message on my laptop. What? Fucking pizza.

186
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:19,690
Free pizza. All right. Do I eventually buy a new apartment or something?

187
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:29,779
And there is a flashlight. That's cool. And you have to actually hold the phone out.

188
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:44,299
Fucking Zoopers. Don't even have like a mag light in your car. Okay. Let's go to the laptop.

189
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:55,980
All right. So I can, here's, here we go. Eddie, Eddie, I got to deliver. Okay. I, where's my money?

190
00:29:57,349 --> 00:30:01,829
Average delivery time. Awesome. Average satisfaction. Not great. Not terrible.

191
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:11,769
I'm pretty fast. Any three grams. Oh, I did have three grams of weed. Shit. Yep. Okay. Confirmed

192
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:18,440
that I thought I didn't think I had it. All right. Donald, you might need that sexy red backpack on

193
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,880
the cupboard. I know you're probably used to those sissy casual games where money stored in

194
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,799
a magic cloud under God's fucking pillow, but it ain't the case for us here. You need space

195
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:35,240
to carry cash. So take that into consideration before you run those first clients. Thanks for

196
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:44,569
the personal attack. I've been personally attacked. All right, let's go. All right. It's 10. I can't,

197
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:49,859
you can disable or re-enable the product from sales. Let me just go deliver this shit first.

198
00:30:49,859 --> 00:31:05,640
There's the, the red, the red sack, old beef row backpack. Um, wait, how do I, I have $86.

199
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:20,230
Is it in there? Backpack contents. Okay. Now I shouldn't take this, right? That one has money

200
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:29,180
in it. Okay. That backpack has $86 in it. I'm not taking that with me. What if somebody tries to get

201
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:48,700
it from me to deliver this, to throw it at them? Oh yeah. If you ever have like a thousand dollars

202
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:55,660
in your pocket, always make sure you have a like $20 bill wrapped in fake paper in your other

203
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,140
pocket. So then somebody's like, give me all your money. You take like the wad of fucking fake paper

204
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:09,210
with the 20 rolled around it and you go take it. Okay. And then throw it and then run. That's how

205
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:21,190
you get killed. That's how, that's how they get you. Then you're in fucking a lot of trouble.

206
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:29,079
Oh, make sure you throw it real far. Then they'll be like, why'd you do that? Why'd you just throw

207
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:34,539
that motherfucker? It's like, I don't know. I was scared. Just check his pockets. No, no,

208
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:43,990
I just threw the money over that way. Don't you see what I did? Where is he? Oh, I have dummy money.

209
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:57,109
That's how you get, that's how you get killed. Hey Donald, thanks for the 36 bucks.

210
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:03,900
The client should be ordering more. Get to the computer and order more dope from Eddie at a

211
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:30,680
resupply. Oh, text. Check the gas station shop. Oh yeah. Let's do that. No friends.

212
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:41,160
Check the gas station for powdered additives. What? What do you mean from, where's that fucking

213
00:33:41,160 --> 00:34:04,230
train? Holy shit. It actually is there. Can I ride it? No. Oh, there's a furniture shop too. Cool.

214
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:14,329
I thought I could start parkouring over shit. All right, let's go. Now that's an interesting

215
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:20,250
place. Look up the two towers. They call it creme de la creme of the native pathology.

216
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,690
But there sure is a lot of magic going on. If you know what I mean. Should I go in?

217
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:39,300
Is it a big party in there? Should I go in there? Can I come in?

218
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:57,530
How do you knock on the door? Why? I want to go in the party. Okay. Are they having fun in there or

219
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:11,130
is the inside of this building burning? Like the doors are all locked. Both. Both. I get it.

220
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:21,510
Oh god damn it. That was sneaky. That was a sneaky one. The doors are sealed with bricks.

221
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:33,369
Are we sure there's not like some fucking horror movie going on in there? Are you sure like saw

222
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:49,460
eight is not going on inside of that building? Okay. So here we are. Microwave. Cool. All right.

223
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,420
Where's my? There it is. All right. Let me get open up my backpack. Let's put more money in there.

224
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:05,900
$122 is in this. Do not lose that. In fact, hide it under the bed. I don't want this in my

225
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:12,739
doors are unlocked. Look at that. Put this that people wouldn't care. I don't know. Like right

226
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:22,739
there. All right. Now let's go to the computer. Shady calm. We got Eddie's got something for me.

227
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:26,900
All right. I heard that you made them sales. Well done. Now if you need more drugs, write to me.

228
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,579
I'll get in contact with you by text and let you know where and when the package will be dropped.

229
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:41,000
All right. Hold on. Let me go lay on one some more. Yo, you able to deliver two grams of gonjo

230
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,119
would really need some man. I don't have any right now. Uh, I need two G's of FET. Have some FET.

231
00:36:50,840 --> 00:37:01,260
Um, that's five FET. FET and all. Eddie, what do we want? I need an order. Let's go.

232
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:11,980
Now let's get how much is marijuana. All right. This is 10 grams of marijuana.

233
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:28,710
That's 50 bucks. I mean people, people smoke weed, right? I get 20, five dollars. I'll get 10.

234
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:43,960
Give me 10. And then we'll do 10 and 10. Okay. 120 dollars. Order it. Here we go. How are you?

235
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:57,719
I got a new order. Gotcha. 10 speed. Cool. It'll be ready in about 30 minutes. What? Give me 30

236
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:04,460
minutes. Sometimes order delivery may take some time. It depends mostly on how large the package

237
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:10,619
is. Remember to always plan this ahead. Eddie will inform you when the package is ready to

238
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,380
retrieve. In the meantime, you can either find some other tasks to do or wait, hit T while in

239
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:21,019
hideout to open the wait dialogue. I go. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'm going to go to the, um,

240
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,469
wait, I'm going to bring, I bring like five dollars with me. How much money is my backpack?

241
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:43,610
Wait, how do I pay for the drugs? That's their skill points? What? General risk factor.

242
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:50,659
Raises with every risky trade, chase, and high risk action. This increases the chance of being

243
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:58,010
robbed, attacked, or ambushed by the DEA. You want to keep this low. Every time criminal activity

244
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,610
includes sales, police chases and arrests. This affects the general visibility of your actions.

245
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,929
Higher exposition means your more police patrols are on the streets and you'll draw DEA.

246
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:15,289
I'm going to keep this low. All right. What about skills? Illusionist? I don't care what it is.

247
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:23,579
I want to be an illusionist. Okay. I'm going to be an illusionist. How much more? Do it again.

248
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,750
That's a slight percent chance that police won't find drugs in your inventory when searched. Good.

249
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:41,539
All right. I have, how many points do I have? That's it. I should have done pockets.

250
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:49,769
Probably should have increased pocket size rather than be like a street magician. Okay. Hold on.

251
00:39:49,769 --> 00:40:05,699
Let me just let Otto out of the room. Watch out. He sensed, he sensed Kim. All right. So there we

252
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:10,500
go. Organizer. Earn your debt to Eddie when you make some money on sales. Check the gas station.

253
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,139
All right. Let's check the, I'm not going to skip time. I want to check the gas station.

254
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:18,090
Sounds like fun. Wait, I need to bring like $5 with me, right? How much is stuff? How much is,

255
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:27,820
how much is stuff at the gas station? Okay. Pick it up and take, um, is that one dollar?

256
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:40,099
Go buy like a pack of gum. Okay. I'll bring like package, retrieve the package.

257
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,829
I'll bring $10 with me. I have a $10 bill. All right. Now get rid of this.

258
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,920
You have three clients so far. That's cute, but it won't get you far to grow your business. You

259
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,440
need to unlock more areas and keep your respect high. Get to the computer to learn more about

260
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:02,780
gaining new sales. Deliveries left in dead drops for a long time may be stolen. Oh fuck. Wait,

261
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:09,590
I have to buy it? I have to bring the backpack? Oh shit. Okay. I gotta go. Do I have to buy them

262
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:29,179
here at the drop? Oh shit. How much money do I have? $122. All right. Where's the drop?

263
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,239
It's right here. It's close. Hurry, hurry. I'm going. I'm going as fast as I can.

264
00:41:36,039 --> 00:42:08,099
Where is it? Are they dogs? What's that? Quick, use my zoomer light. Where is it? Oh,

265
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:20,710
there it is. Okay. I got it. All right. So now take this, take this. I didn't even need to bring

266
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:33,750
the money. Do I put the money over here on the wall? I have, why am I had this cash on me?

267
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:54,230
Why did you guys tell me to do this? Oh, it's Eddie. What? Oh no, I have to fuck it. Wait,

268
00:42:54,230 --> 00:43:03,219
good thing I'm a master illusionist. Excuse me, sir. And I'm going to fucking like put crumple up

269
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:05,860
like a piece of paper and like throw it behind his head and I'm going to find the paper behind

270
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:24,650
his ear. Just like that Chris angel episode. Okay. I gotta go back to my house. All right.

271
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:42,019
Bring the drugs into my house. Okay. Now. Okay. So I'm put the cash in the cupboard.

272
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:53,159
Is that in the cupboard? It is. Okay. I'm going to take, let's take half. I want it to keep half on

273
00:43:53,159 --> 00:44:07,719
me. Oh, I'm holding control. Control is supposed to be quantity, right? How come that's not working?

274
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:26,280
I want to take, Oh, it's one 10. What? It's one 10 gram pack. No throwing rocks at my window.

275
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:42,500
Oh, well, can I give somebody? Can I like dump it in his hands? I unlocked East old town. Okay.

276
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,639
Eddie. All right. Packages waiting for you. You can pick it up. Okay. Here. Deliver cash.

277
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,280
I have cash for you. Can we meet? All right. Waiting for you at my place. You owe $120.

278
00:44:53,239 --> 00:45:17,420
Fuck. Choose a spray symbol to mark your territory. Um, gas mask, nuclear, one guy, a dead,

279
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:27,739
dead one guy, Satan, bullet, uh, the letter F but backwards. I wrote from team fortress

280
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:54,139
and the funny number. Hmm. Hmm. It's tricky. I'm gonna have to go one dead guy.

281
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:00,219
You can buy spray paint in shops like the gas station or find some leftover cans in the ghetto.

282
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:11,449
Look around. All right. So I have to meet him with $120. All right. Where's my cupboard? Okay.

283
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:28,250
$120. All right. Just keep, drop $2. All right. I have $2. Let's bring. All right. 120 bucks.

284
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:46,300
You have a $2 profit. I know that's not good. $2. All right. Where's Eddie? Deliver a free sample.

285
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:57,909
I don't have any. I don't have a sample. There's money in times. Just what I don't have. All right.

286
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:19,480
But look at this. Eddie, is that a cop? Is that a cop? This is not a cop. But who is this? Why

287
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,519
did the question mark? Talk to stranger. What's the problem? Attention. Attention.

288
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:31,639
Attention. Attention. What? To all guest citizens. Police hours are to start in 60 minutes.

289
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:37,820
Wait. Why is there like a dystopian half-life? For their own safety,

290
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,989
citizens are to proceed to their quarters. What? Individuals caught in public areas during police

291
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:52,170
hours may face consequences. Attention. Attention. Attention. We're gonna do the whole thing.

292
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:57,289
We're gonna do the whole thing. Hi. Yeah, here it is.

293
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:06,949
Police hours are to start in 60 minutes. For their own safety, citizens are to proceed to their

294
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:14,630
quarters. Individuals caught in public areas during police hours may face consequences.

295
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:23,800
Attention. Attention. He does it again? Does it do it in every language?

296
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:30,360
It will start in 60 minutes. I repeat. Police hours will start in 60 minutes.

297
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,800
All right. I guess I have to go back home.

298
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:38,420
That's not my house. Fuck. Where's my house?

299
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:57,769
That's not my house. No more? Are we not going to get that in any other languages?

300
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:12,789
Okay. Here we go. Activate workstation. Workstations are furniture-based equipment.

301
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:18,309
Here you can customize your drug lab. Store drugs and substances meant for mixing and

302
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:22,630
processing. This is also the place where you pack the product to its final weight portions

303
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:30,780
prepared for sale. There we go. Okay. So you're in workstation mode now.

304
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:36,619
You can arrange your lab to mix and produce whatever you desire. Remember chemistry classes

305
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:42,380
back in school? No? Yeah, me neither. Fuck it. Who cares, right? You'll find more info in

306
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:53,400
the workstation manual. Okay. Hit tab and cycle to the drug replacement mode. Here you can put

307
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,280
drugs and additives on the table to pick them back up. Don't mix bleach and ammonia. You'll die.

308
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:05,750
Right? I don't want to do that. Equipment mode. Medium jar. All right. Hold on. I need my drugs

309
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:17,130
first. Somebody's knocking the door. All right. I want to break this up into three, three, three.

310
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:27,880
Right? What do people want? Okay. I want three G's of weed, three, five, two G's. Okay. We need two G,

311
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:40,389
three G. Okay. Two G of speed, three G of weed. No, two G of grass, three G. Can we just have the

312
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:51,420
same code word? Just call it W. Why are you changing the code word? I just gave it to you. Okay.

313
00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:59,019
You want two G's of speed and then two G's of... Who the fuck are you? Heard that you sell weed.

314
00:50:59,019 --> 00:51:07,639
I need two G's. Urgent. All right. Well, hold on. I need two, two, two. Two, two, two. All right. I want

315
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:21,800
pick up 10... Okay. So now it's on the hit tab to cycle equipment mode. Okay. Put some containers

316
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,699
around so we can store the drugs in them. How much is a small jar? We need just little jars, right?

317
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:39,099
Okay. Yeah. We need two little jars. One, two. We need... Okay. We need weed. Urgent.

318
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:43,219
Now we'll put the substance into the container. There are two ways to do that. Select the source

319
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:50,920
with left mouse and then choose add substance. Or simply drag and drop the substance on the

320
00:51:50,920 --> 00:52:05,909
container. Okay. All right. So I want handle objects with options such as lab mode. Oh, okay.

321
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:14,489
Oh shit. Okay. I get it. Put that on here. Go to lab mode.

322
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:26,679
Okay. Two G's. That's too many. That's two G's too many. Two point O G's.

323
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:45,050
Edit the container label. What? Ding dong, motherfucker. Bedtime. During police hours,

324
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:52,820
you should remain home. But we, the bad guys, we don't give a fuck. The police do though. So

325
00:52:52,820 --> 00:53:00,230
you keep an eye on them and better stick to the shadows. Working at night reduces exposition and

326
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:07,719
boosts respect and experience gain from sales. All right. Well, okay. So that's two of those.

327
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:19,030
Give me this back. How do I pick that back up? Okay. Now I need weed. Okay. Lab mode was two

328
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:30,699
two G's. Okay. This is mirror. That's not how you spell it. We're going to, this is, um,

329
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:49,269
okay. That's in there. That's two. I need one more small. Um, I need one more small one.

330
00:53:53,400 --> 00:54:06,780
I can, can I just grab two? I can't have, I guess I can't, um, I got to buy more.

331
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:18,679
Really? Okay. Well, let me get off this. How do I get out of here? Give me this. How do I pick it up?

332
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:30,469
Oh, select add dump contents. No, no, no. I want to pay. How do I just put

333
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:36,500
everybody equivalent on every equipment type has its options. One of them is somebody just shot a

334
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,340
gun package product where you can choose and what quantities and grams has to pack the dope. If you

335
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:50,500
need more details, but isn't it already packed? Hold on. What? Hold on. I think the dog is outside.

336
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,500
Hold on. I thought, I thought that was a dog in the game for a second. Give me one second.

337
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:59,289
How do I pick this up? So not throw backpack package product. Okay. So that was a package

338
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:10,250
product. Total source, new package, add new package package size two grams. Wait, what should I make

339
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:26,920
a, I can't just put this in my backpack. Can't see. Oh, so why I can't just pick up the jar and put

340
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:38,619
it in my backpack. Like I have to package the product package product, total source mass,

341
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:47,739
two grams. Okay. Add new package package size two grams. Or as I used to store, you sell with bags.

342
00:56:47,739 --> 00:56:58,199
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm still, I'm not, I, I'm, I did this wrong. I'm supposed

343
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:10,659
to sell with the bag. Package product. I'm just going to do a new package package size two grams,

344
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:23,699
two grams of amphetamine. I got it. Okay. So now this is empty. The jars just sit on the table.

345
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:34,710
Okay. Package product. This is two grams. I need two of these, don't I? Right. So I need two of

346
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:45,880
these because I'm doing two, because I need two of them. Will it just make two? That will work,

347
00:57:45,880 --> 00:58:04,280
right? Two. Yeah, it will. You can only have two in there. Total source mass two grams. So it can

348
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:25,050
only be two grams. There's only two in here. Should I put four in there? Okay. So there's four in

349
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:36,619
there. So now if I go to package product, new package, I want two, two gram packages. There it

350
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:47,820
is. Okay. Good. Store drugs in jar. Make drugs to sell. Yeah. All right. I thought I was trying to

351
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:56,840
give you to sell them. Add substance. Put it all in the jar. This will just keep us labeled as

352
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:04,789
correctly as amphetamine. Put these in here and add it all to the jar. This is marijuana. Make it

353
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:14,300
green. Okay. Now I know what these are. Oh, wait. I need weed urgent. Well, I didn't reply yet.

354
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:22,889
Okay. So there's my drugs. I get it. Now I have, I have, what do I have? I have two, two, two,

355
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:34,300
two dollars. All right. I'm ready. Where is he? I need two grams urgent. I'll do you last to make

356
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:42,179
sure I get you in delivery. Two grams of weed. You got it. Two grams of that. You got it.

357
00:59:43,079 --> 01:00:02,949
And two grams of weed urgently. Got it. Okay. This guy right here. Save the game. Fuck. Well,

358
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:12,710
it's urgent. It was urgent. It was urgent. It was urgent, but it was urgent. Okay. Please wait one

359
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:32,039
minute. What? Did it save? Oh, okay. I'm ready. I need my zoomer power. All right. There's that

360
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:44,179
guy that needs it urgently. Is that somebody that I need to talk to? Oh shit. It is. Hey, come here.

361
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:54,219
You got it. Yep. I got it. What did you want? Two G's. Thank you. $44. All right. Have a nice day.

362
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,539
Next is Donald. Donald, you're right here and put him right next to each other. Good.

363
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:10,260
I do have it. You wanted two G's. Oh, excuse me. One. Thank you. Okay. Last one was the urgent one.

364
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:26,460
I did it to the cops. Is this guy? Right. I'm going urgently. Don't worry.

365
01:01:29,909 --> 01:01:43,059
Hey, you're finally here. Yeah. Well, you just ordered. Thank you. $40. Done. All right. I got

366
01:01:43,059 --> 01:01:46,809
to get the hell out of here. I got to get out of here and go to sleep. I got to mark my territory

367
01:01:46,809 --> 01:01:57,300
there. I have to piss on the wall like a dog. Mark my territory? Why isn't it tag? Why is it

368
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:38,489
mark? Where do I do it? Oh, I don't have a spray paint. Right. Oh, fuck. Police. This guy's like

369
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:55,699
on the phone. I'm going to break in his house. I feel like this is a trap. Is the ground going

370
01:02:55,699 --> 01:03:27,420
to fall underneath me now? What was the point of this? Okay. I'll get paint. I will tomorrow

371
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:43,059
morning. I got to go back to the house first. I'll get paint. Good. I got money. Let's store it.

372
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:57,739
I got $126 in cash. I have no money. Only $126. What the hell? I have $4 in profit. How much do

373
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:11,530
I know? I still have drugs in there. Okay. It was pressed T. Waiting time. Does this go any faster?

374
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:34,710
Nobody fucking calls me. All right. Donald wants four grams of amphetamines. I have that.

375
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:44,820
Got it. Get him a new package for you. All right. I need a workstation. Go ahead and pack that up.

376
01:04:45,780 --> 01:05:06,300
One package of four. What do I mean? How am I supposed to do this? Oh, well, okay. I got it.

377
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:17,980
Yeah. I didn't know if I had to do it in one. What? Why are they getting closer? Where's my

378
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:36,949
backpack? Okay. Where's the delivery going to go? Over there. How much stuff is happening right now?

379
01:05:36,949 --> 01:05:54,730
A lot, apparently. All right. I'm heading down. Possibly robbed armor on Old Town. What? Did I

380
01:05:54,730 --> 01:06:00,869
just eat? I don't even know the words. I just. Hey, come over here, pal. Run, motherfucker, run.

381
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:30,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm sleeping. Your door is open. What? They can't see me now.

382
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:42,260
Oh, damn, man. I almost shit my pants. I suppose you've gone all the way though.

383
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:50,099
Did I call Eddie? All right. I got it. You're a fugitive now. What do you mean I'm a fugitive?

384
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:54,739
The policeman that chased you will probably recognize you, so watch out. What? Others will be

385
01:06:54,739 --> 01:06:59,300
more alerted for naughty looking assholes like you running around the area. God damn it. Better

386
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:19,190
keep a low profile. I have to change clothes now? Change faces. I have to deliver these drugs. He's

387
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:26,809
right there. I got to go out and bang a left. All right. The train is going to give me cover.

388
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:57,369
God damn it. What? Oh, don't get me. Wait. Oh, wait. Where's my secret area? Where's my secret

389
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:14,340
door? The one that I opened? Where's the one that I opened? Which one is it? Where is he? Oh,

390
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:20,579
fuck. I just, I found him. He's literally right here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy. Yeah, yeah,

391
01:08:20,579 --> 01:08:22,899
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. I got it. I got it. Give me the money, please.

392
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:27,460
Thank you. Bye. Bye. Hey, by the way, take this fucking backpack. It's free, dickhead.

393
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:58,229
No, I need the money. All right. I'm good. See, officer, I didn't have any money. I just had drugs.

394
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:12,229
No, the other way around. So I wanted to say that the other way. Hey, hey, hey, Jeffrey,

395
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:21,579
Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey. How are you? Hey, you want any more? I got some free samples

396
01:09:21,579 --> 01:09:41,399
for you, Jeffrey. Here it is. This is my secret house. I got to remember this. Where is this?

397
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:50,390
Okay. I mean, I need to remember that's the secret house. Suspicious individual. Nope. Not me.

398
01:09:50,390 --> 01:10:13,430
What? Oh, that's not even my fucking house. It's got a house symbol on it. Nope. All right.

399
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:25,500
I'm going to sleep. How do you go to bed? Tea? If a tea doesn't go to sleep, it just makes time

400
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:32,409
go a little faster. How much money do I have? I've got a hundred and I got a hundred and ninety four

401
01:10:32,409 --> 01:11:14,939
dollars. Tea. Tea again? I'm going to wait till like what? Where I am? Toop. Toop. What's that?

402
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:24,390
Hello? How am I still a fugitive? Well, it's only been like four hours, of course.

403
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:35,829
All right, Donald. I want four grams. Emma wants four grams. What do I have left?

404
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:44,970
Buy some more. I've got, I need more amphetamine. Amphetamine selling pretty well. I got to buy

405
01:11:44,970 --> 01:12:06,060
more amphetamine. Hey, just cut the drugs. Okay. Eddie, I need to make an order, Eddie. I need

406
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:15,260
four, eight. Yeah, I need eight grams. I want twelve. No, we'll just do, do twelve grams.

407
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:24,060
Twelve grams of amphetamine and yeah, let's spend some money. Total value. I can only buy

408
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:43,899
$130 worth. Why? Well, then fine. I'll buy, I'll buy like, I don't know, four? What? Why? It's eighty

409
01:12:43,899 --> 01:12:56,279
four bucks. It's only fifty dollars. What are they talking about? Five, ten, fifteen, fine, two.

410
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:07,750
Can I only buy one of these? What the fuck is going on? Fifty dollars for a bag. That makes

411
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:32,329
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. I still, I fucking goddamn mathematics. Minimum ten grams purchase.

412
01:13:32,329 --> 01:13:43,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cash is in there. You ready? You got it? It's minimum. You have

413
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:49,500
to buy a minimum ten grams. All right. Thirty minutes. You, uh, four grams to be specific.

414
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:53,500
Four grams and four grams. Everyone's good. You guys have, I've already delivered to you.

415
01:13:55,739 --> 01:14:03,180
You too. Wait, I did. Two grams urgent. Got it. Two grams urgent. Yeah, I got it. All right. I need

416
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:20,970
eight. I can't do these yet. I have to get the drugs first. I can take one because that's all I

417
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:28,970
have. Okay. I can do you and then I can pick up the package. Let's go. Oh, you're right out the

418
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:57,539
fucking door. This is perfect. Why is it still police hours? I was right here. Emma? Emma? Sixty

419
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:10,680
eight bucks. Good. It's always police hours. I want to go to the gas station. Okay. Well,

420
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:16,550
now I get away for the drug. Can I just stand still here? Now, why would I stand still here?

421
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:29,460
That would be the stupidest fucking thing ever. Watch out for the police patrol. I know. Don't

422
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:34,140
worry. They're not going to get me. I got some decent amount of money though that I can spend

423
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:43,100
on whatever the who knows something. Something fucking good. I buy supplies, food, or a

424
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:59,380
figurine of the green Teletubby. Which one? What do you think? He's a Funko Pop addict.

425
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:07,909
I need four grams. I can't do that yet. This one is now empty. How much how much man one is in there?

426
01:16:09,109 --> 01:16:22,180
How much is in there? Ed, drop package ready for the trash bin. It's still police hours. What the

427
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:34,859
fuck? Why? How much drugs are in there? Yeah, they're in there. I don't know why I decided to

428
01:16:34,859 --> 01:16:52,569
do that. Twelve grams in there? No, that's an electrical box. It's right here. It's police

429
01:16:52,569 --> 01:17:00,220
right over here though. Get out of the way. Move police. Oops. I don't have anything on me, right?

430
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:29,060
No, I have $68 on me. Why is that such a concern? Where is it? In the trash? Okay, now I'm illegal.

431
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:48,550
Now I'm against the law. Get the fuck out of here. All right, I made it. It's still police hours.

432
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:57,939
Why is it still police hours? I want to get invited to the party. Why am I not allowed at the party?

433
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:03,619
Whose fucking house is this? I thought this was like a hotel door leading to the other room,

434
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:14,010
but it's the bathroom. I've seen this like five times. This is not a hotel. Okay, I got the drugs.

435
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:27,420
Let's go ahead and do some placement here. Okay, let's pick this up. Cost that shit in there.

436
01:18:28,859 --> 01:18:36,659
N. So there is now 10 grams in there. Put this marijuana in there. Fill it up. The rest of this

437
01:18:36,659 --> 01:18:48,260
shit. Uh oh. Just get a medium jar. How much are these? Do I just own them? I just own these.

438
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:59,140
This doesn't cost any money. I just own them. Oh, what's the point of having the small ones?

439
01:18:59,699 --> 01:19:25,029
Okay, good. Mixing tray. Wait, how do I mix? Can I mix like, can I mix marijuana and like

440
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:32,460
coconut oil or something to make it look stickier and better? That's to cut it. Oh, wait, wait, wait.

441
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:58,220
So hold on. Wait, show options. Okay. Mix details. Mix details. Amphetamine. Total mix mass. Add

442
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:09,930
substance. Need to buy powder. So wait, I have to. Okay, I can't do this yet.

443
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:24,699
The worst mix is not ready. What? No, take it out. Dump. How do I take it? Apply the mix? There is

444
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:40,819
no mix. Deselect. Package this. Apply mix. There is no mix. New amphetamine. All right, if I take

445
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:48,649
the amphetamine, put it in another box and write new amphetamine on it. Look at that. All right.

446
01:20:56,180 --> 01:21:01,930
All right. So I need to do, let's see, still police hours. I'm fucking just going to wait till

447
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:14,220
five in the morning. What color do you think the Hulk's? Of all the things that somebody writes

448
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:20,199
in chat, why would I pick that one out? I just decided to pick that up. Press T again. I think

449
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:27,960
this is as fast as it goes. And to answer your really, really stupid fucking question, it's green.

450
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:39,930
The Hulk is green. He's green. What are you talking about? It's still police hours. 5 a.m.? 6 a.m.?

451
01:21:40,569 --> 01:22:01,189
How can you be sure? What? Because it has to be. All right. I'm taking these orders. All right.

452
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:08,069
The package is waiting for you. How much do I owe you? I own like a hundred and 120 bucks. All right.

453
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:16,439
We'll do it all. Four grams of that. Confirm it. You want two grams of that. Confirm it. You want

454
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:32,180
two grams of... Oh, nobody wants any weed today. Shit. Okay. What was it? 442? I can handle that.

455
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:42,569
New package. Two. One. Quantity of two. And then we need... We actually need a lot of those.

456
01:22:42,569 --> 01:22:56,680
So we need four of these. All right. Let's go. That gives us... All right. You want to do...

457
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:10,439
Four. Two. Four. Two. Right. We're good. All right. Let's go. Let's go give him some money.

458
01:23:11,079 --> 01:23:18,520
Still fucking police hours for some reason. I need to put $120 in here. Take this shit out.

459
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:31,699
Take out... I don't know math. Who cares? Let's take out seven. All right. I got the

460
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:44,260
222. Wait. I already had one. That's two, four, six, eight, ten grams. Okay. Who cares? What? No,

461
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:54,420
that's right. Okay. All right. Let's go. Still police hours for some reason. Six a.m. No more

462
01:23:54,420 --> 01:24:10,970
police. What? I have to deliver this shit. I took all these orders. Fuck. Orders are going to be

463
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:33,340
late. All right. Let's do top to bottom or bottom to top. Still police out. Why did I not take the

464
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:54,789
sneak ability? What's wrong with me? Hey, Donald. You wanted four grams. So you take two of these.

465
01:24:55,670 --> 01:25:09,619
Okay. Thank you. $68. I thought that was the police. I thought it was like... Let's go to Emma.

466
01:25:09,619 --> 01:25:31,850
Hey, no police. Emma, I've got two grams for you. All right. I've got to give... After this,

467
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:41,510
I've got to give some money. One. Okay. Thank you. And then we got to go across to

468
01:25:42,789 --> 01:26:02,539
Raphael. Shit. Still police hours. I don't know how. Can you stop by my place and sell me some

469
01:26:02,539 --> 01:26:11,779
crack? I don't know. Do you live here? I got what you need. Here we go. You wanted... Oh, and no,

470
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:21,750
you don't get anything for free. Not here. Not now. All right. Good. All right. Eddie.

471
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:37,050
Where's Eddie? Right there. Let's square up, Eddie. 120 bucks. Good. All right. Let's go. Let's give

472
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:44,489
a free drug sample to somebody. It was somebody standing around here, right? Just give free drugs

473
01:26:44,489 --> 01:26:56,420
sample. Find a stranger and just give them drugs. No, those are cops. Don't give cops drugs. Hey,

474
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:04,779
officer. I got it. Something you might like. Police hours is gone. Good. All right. Deliver

475
01:27:04,779 --> 01:27:07,899
a free sample. Somebody should be right here. I saw them earlier. Where the hell did they go?

476
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:31,930
In the house? No, he was walking around. Well, I can't do that right now. All right. I want to

477
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:43,079
go to the gas station. You should buy a gun. Well, I need money to buy a gun, don't I? All right. Gas

478
01:27:43,079 --> 01:27:50,659
station. Let's see what they have here. That's a cop. Stop. Police checkpoint. Well, I'm not going

479
01:27:50,659 --> 01:28:07,670
through that. Is that me? Okay. Talk to Amy Schrader. What do you need? I want to buy something.

480
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:23,819
Washing powder, baking soda, and a spray paint. 25 of them. All right. I want one of these. How

481
01:28:23,819 --> 01:28:36,460
much is that? It's $57. All right. Medium backpack, acetone, salt, sugar. All right. Give me some

482
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:49,750
sugar. I'll give me some salt. Oh, I can't fit it. Baking soda. Okay. I'll take some baking soda.

483
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:59,189
Okay. I guess ibuprofen pills. Can I take those? All right. Well, I got what I want. Okay. All

484
01:28:59,189 --> 01:29:14,359
right. Beat it. Baking soda. Baking soda. All right. Beat it. Yeah. You too. Can I buy beer? You need

485
01:29:14,359 --> 01:29:29,670
to look away. You guys need to fucking relax. All right. Let's go. I got spray paint. I want to spray

486
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:45,260
paint. I want to spray the territory. I want to get invited to the party. When do I get invited

487
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:59,449
to the cool party? Not invited. I will be. I'm going to become the best drug dealer in the city.

488
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:08,010
Now I'll get tons of drug points. You got to start selling in bulk. Well, I'm not there yet.

489
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:29,739
Let me just spray paint my face. Excuse me. Here. I have a present for you. I can't just give him

490
01:30:29,739 --> 01:31:02,899
$10. Okay. Here. You want some drugs? No fucking messages ever. What? No one's talking to me.

491
01:31:03,699 --> 01:31:16,149
Who's that? Another drug client? All right. Wait. I got a spray paint. Okay. Hold F.

492
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:33,239
Holy shit. That's awful. Keep in mind. Gaining respect is one thing. Keeping it is another.

493
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:39,560
Respect in neighborhoods slowly drops in time. I couldn't forget to keep those sales flowing.

494
01:31:40,439 --> 01:31:45,880
Low respect is less sales. Less sales is less money. Where is this person talking to me from?

495
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:54,300
Well, it just sucks. Okay. All right. So unlock East Old Town Old Marketplace. Buy spray paint

496
01:31:54,300 --> 01:32:16,970
and place four wall markings. All right. Don't lie. Don't lie. You all had to fucking done that

497
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:21,050
with a can. You've all turned the can of whipped cream upside down and ate like fucking way too

498
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:37,670
much whipped cream. Not right side up. Upside down. Not right side up. Upside. No. I'm talking

499
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:43,029
about like the joke that's in every fucking comedy movie from like the 90s. I don't even

500
01:32:43,029 --> 01:32:46,470
joke. You take the whipped cream out of the fridge and you turn it upside down and go

501
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:50,949
and then you turn to whoever you're talking to in the room and you go.

502
01:32:53,500 --> 01:33:05,140
Every single fucking person has done that. I don't believe you. Let me get this straight.

503
01:33:05,699 --> 01:33:13,989
A bunch of you guys have never turned a whipped cream can upside down and like into your mouth.

504
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:26,380
That's impossible. There's no fucking way any of you are telling the truth. What? Not ever in your

505
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:40,890
whole life ever. There's no way. I don't believe any of you. Unbelievable. I've never done anything

506
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:49,739
like that. It's disgusting. How dare you do something like that. No. I sit down at a table

507
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:55,979
with a fork and knife and I get a plate and I take the can of whipped cream and I turn it up. First

508
01:33:55,979 --> 01:34:01,579
I wipe the nozzle down and then I turn it upside down and I do onto the plate and then I take the

509
01:34:01,579 --> 01:34:12,300
fork and knife and I cut into it and eat it like a fucking steak. No, you've done that. And if you

510
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:21,029
haven't, I just don't believe you. Okay. Where are we going? No, I got a lot of storage. I got to

511
01:34:21,029 --> 01:34:42,020
store some stuff. I got money. Do you eat rubber cement? Rubber cement is not whipped cream out of

512
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:58,260
a can. Rubber cement is an adhesive. And no, I'm not talking about like breathing in the gas. Okay.

513
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:17,939
I'm talking about, no, some of you guys. Oh, fuck. I'm talking about just, no, this is

514
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:50,220
eating a tub of whipped cream ASMR. No, you guys know what I'm saying. This is like you eat it.

515
01:35:50,220 --> 01:36:08,409
This just crashed my computer. Okay. I'm not going to listen to that. No. You go here. I'll do it on

516
01:36:08,409 --> 01:36:22,229
camera. I'm talking about when you go like this, you go and then you, and then it turns the liquid

517
01:36:22,229 --> 01:36:49,260
in your mouth. So you go and it's gone. Don't do that on cam. Oh, all right. Don't call me Lego

518
01:36:49,260 --> 01:37:01,189
hair. Okay. Donald, how much do I have? Let me check my inventory. All right. Let's put, wait.

519
01:37:01,989 --> 01:37:55,829
Hey, people are trying to sleep out here. But I don't, I don't know. Trying to find the window.

520
01:37:55,829 --> 01:38:02,539
All right. Well, I was going to put baking soda in drugs, right? This is bad. This is bad. Sugar in

521
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:13,689
okay. So let's do placement mode. Just baking soda. And am I going to like, am I going to hurt

522
01:38:13,689 --> 01:38:27,500
people? Oh, nothing in there. I need more. Um, I need more drugs. Shit. Okay. I got to buy,

523
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:33,640
I need more amphetamine. God damn it. Okay. Hold on. Let me put this away. Uh, let's put the money

524
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:41,539
away. Let's do, we'll keep the, this can of spray paint. I'll do one more tag and we'll have that in

525
01:38:41,539 --> 01:38:49,029
the, you know, he's a drug dealer with a conscience. I mean, what do you want me to do?

526
01:38:49,829 --> 01:39:01,430
All right. I need more. Everyone wants amphetamine. Eddie, Eddie, I need a new order and it's, it's all,

527
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:22,039
it's going to be all amphetamine. I'm going to get 20 G's of amphetamine. Okay. Anybody call me?

528
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:33,029
What the fuck? Throw the backpack. Chop Antonopoulos. I'm looking for ganja. I need two

529
01:39:33,029 --> 01:39:40,949
grams. All right. Don't have any amphetamine. Okay. I need, uh, that's amphetamine.

530
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:50,180
All right. I can sell to you. I got weed. What? Two grams? I got it. Don't worry. What if I just

531
01:39:50,180 --> 01:40:03,800
brought the box of sugar? New package, two grams. All right, let's go. And then I can pick up the

532
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:18,539
delivery. Sounds good to me. Cut the weed with sugar. Oh, you're literally right there.

533
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:27,909
Where are all these dogs? Every time I come over here, there's dogs, dogs, dogs, but I don't,

534
01:40:27,909 --> 01:40:43,779
I never see them. All right. What's up? I have it. 20 bucks. That's it. I was about to say who the

535
01:40:43,779 --> 01:40:50,010
fuck did that? It was me. I was like, who's stealing my stuff? I have to go to the other place. I have

536
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:59,369
to go to the other town. It's not even my house. Wait, I'm normal. I'm normal. I have spray painting

537
01:40:59,369 --> 01:41:05,350
cash. I could be working. I'm doing a DIY project outside in front of my house. I'm spray painting

538
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:20,329
a table. This table. Okay. We're good. This is a new customer, but I don't know. I don't have any

539
01:41:20,329 --> 01:41:40,789
drugs. All right. Where's my uh, is this like whipped cream? I can't believe none of you guys

540
01:41:40,789 --> 01:41:46,810
do the whipped cream thing. There's so many things that are normal that I have done in my life that

541
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:54,409
you guys think is just like, I may as well be like screaming somewhere, like on the sidewalk,

542
01:41:55,989 --> 01:41:58,949
like with like, like naked or something. Like, oh, what are you talking about?

543
01:42:00,659 --> 01:42:11,739
All right. I got my, where's the package? All right. Package is right there in East old town.

544
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:20,229
I, that's, that's, those are my drugs. I need them. This guy breathes regularly. No, actually,

545
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:25,000
I kind of don't. I kind of, when I'm like sleeping and like lying down, I do like a,

546
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:40,149
and then I kind of, sometimes I do that and I like, hold on. I think I,

547
01:42:48,100 --> 01:43:04,920
did I have another backpack? Geez, please tell me you're giving free drug samples.

548
01:43:07,699 --> 01:43:15,289
No, you're under arrest. Oh geez. All right. Let's just go get the package. Wait, that person was

549
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:26,810
running over to the package. These things get stolen. Can't they get the fuck out of here?

550
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:38,810
Need to level up illusion. Where is it? There it is. It's the tires. Thank you. Got it. All right.

551
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:49,430
Let's go do these orders. That's not my house. I think it's my house every time.

552
01:44:02,729 --> 01:44:07,050
So can I eventually unlock any door I want? This is like a lockpicking skill.

553
01:44:07,689 --> 01:44:21,539
Why don't I just do that? Illusionist. Pockets. Quick learner. Increases experience points.

554
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:31,180
Increases the price you're able to demand for your product. Oh, but illusionist.

555
01:44:35,939 --> 01:44:38,979
Decreases the probability you'll be spotted by the police. That's so important.

556
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:46,760
Increases running speed. Stamina. Number of pockets, making you able to carry more

557
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:54,840
items without a backpack. I think I want salesman. Yeah. I want to be able to sell my stuff for more

558
01:44:54,840 --> 01:45:08,569
money. I got the drugs. Now who wants them? I could just waiting at the playgrounds. Okay. Cool.

559
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:39,350
I need two G's. So we need two, three, two. Two, three, two. Two, three, two. Oh, here. And we're

560
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:45,319
going to change this up a little bit. Okay. Two, three, two. So let's put these drugs over here

561
01:45:47,609 --> 01:45:55,350
and we're going to add what? Five grams of five grams and then I'm going to put five grams of

562
01:45:55,350 --> 01:46:34,680
baking soda. Okay. And then we're going to apply. Okay. So this is, all right. I did it.

563
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:53,079
The mix has been applied. All right. So store it in here. 9.96. Okay. Cool. This is 90% baking soda.

564
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:59,260
No, it's not. Okay. So now I'm going to sell this. So we need two, three, two. So now I'm going to

565
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:21,029
package one package of three and then two packages of two. Okay. Let's try it. Remember you're out

566
01:47:21,029 --> 01:47:35,510
here curing heartburn, but don't you guys know? You think I'm like such a bad guy, right? You know,

567
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:41,899
every Hershey bar can have up to like six bug legs in each bar. You know that, right? They can,

568
01:47:41,899 --> 01:47:50,149
the FDA allows up to like three insect legs per Hershey bar. This is true. This is not me making

569
01:47:50,149 --> 01:48:03,529
this up. This is a real actual fact. So I can put two or three bug legs in my cocaine or 50% baking

570
01:48:03,529 --> 01:48:14,380
soda as an urban legend. No, it's not. That's a Facebook headline. It's not a Facebook headline.

571
01:48:14,939 --> 01:48:21,270
It's been proven by, you know, you know, I don't know. I don't know. I've never looked into it.

572
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:25,829
I, it's just, that's what I've been told. I've never done the research to determine if that was

573
01:48:25,829 --> 01:48:31,350
real. I think that's just what was something that was told to me over like the decade or so that

574
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:36,489
I've been what? Whatever, you know, 20 of them, whatever, however long it's been. It's just, hey,

575
01:48:36,489 --> 01:48:40,329
this is a, there's like 10 bug legs in every Hershey bar. And it's like, oh yeah. Everyone

576
01:48:40,329 --> 01:48:45,289
just says that. I never fucking looked up like, are there insect legs in a Hershey bar? I don't

577
01:48:45,289 --> 01:48:49,449
fucking care. I don't care. If I'll leave them, maybe I don't give a shit. If this bug legs in

578
01:48:49,449 --> 01:48:53,460
them was zero bug legs, who cares? Bug legs are fine. It's not going to hurt you. All right.

579
01:48:53,460 --> 01:49:10,920
Goodbye. Oh, people have orders waiting. All right. So we got two grams. You got it. Two grams.

580
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:17,800
You got it. Three grams. You got it. Okay. Two, three, two. Let's go save the game.

581
01:49:25,899 --> 01:49:43,289
Why not 10? What? Okay. There's Donald. Here you go, Donald. So you, how many want two? I'm

582
01:49:43,289 --> 01:49:54,359
not sure I would take something with the label that says filler test. It worked.

583
01:50:04,979 --> 01:50:22,300
Mayor Raphael. Do you want three? You want, no, you wanted two.

584
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:30,390
Four bucks. Thank you. You can keep some of your money on a bank account. There are a few

585
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:34,470
ATMs in the ghetto where you can withdraw deposit cash. You'll need bank account money for furniture

586
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:42,010
shopping. Oh, I can put money in a bank. All right. That's good. Really good to know. Emma.

587
01:50:52,789 --> 01:50:59,960
I do. Here it is. Three grams. It's a lot. Check out one of the ATM. Okay. Where's the ATM?

588
01:51:01,289 --> 01:51:10,680
ATM. You are allowed up to 60 insect parts in a hundred grams of chocolate. This is real. Good.

589
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:17,609
So I was right. All right. I got a hundred. Let's put a hundred dollars in the ATM.

590
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:26,180
All right. So, okay. If they stay alive and theoretically, shouldn't I just do

591
01:51:26,819 --> 01:51:33,770
like 98% baking soda at some point, I guess you're going to get it caught doing that.

592
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:59,739
This is ATM. Oh, I can't, I'm not allowed over there.

593
01:51:59,739 --> 01:52:17,510
98% bug and phetamines. Okay. Here we go. ATM. There it is. All right. Activate the ATM.

594
01:52:18,069 --> 01:52:24,710
Okay. Now listen up carefully. The bank account is the place to keep your legal money.

595
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:31,989
You can use ATMs to withdraw or deposit cash, but be careful. Huh? And keep in mind that you're an

596
01:52:31,989 --> 01:52:38,229
immigrant ghetto low life too much unregistered money flowing through that account interest of

597
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:54,939
the state. Let's put, let's put in $10 and watch while the bank gives us fees every month for

598
01:52:54,939 --> 01:53:00,220
$30 and our bank account becomes negative, like 250 over the course of the next three months.

599
01:53:02,789 --> 01:53:19,079
Bastards. Oh yeah. At an ATM, you can withdraw or deposit cash. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

600
01:53:19,079 --> 01:53:22,119
Keep in mind that too much unregistered cashflow draws authorities attention.

601
01:53:22,119 --> 01:53:25,079
You need to check your account balance. You can do so the Shadycom computer.

602
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:34,140
Also getting into debt. First of all, you'll need that account for some payments. And second of all,

603
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:41,079
the state dislikes criminals, but it sure hates debtors. Okay. Well, I got my money safe.

604
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:55,399
Who are you? Can I come in? Furniture shop. Oh, that has money in it. All right. Cool. What are my

605
01:53:55,399 --> 01:54:02,649
tasks? Unlock East old town in the old marketplace. Nobody fucking calls me. Nobody cares. All right.

606
01:54:02,649 --> 01:54:11,609
Back to the house. I think that's like a shadow of somebody running behind me.

607
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:28,250
Wrong house. No, no, it's not the wrong house. Not yet. Almost wrong house. He thought I was

608
01:54:28,250 --> 01:55:02,890
going to do it. Fuck. Okay. Save game. Now let's keep going with this drug stuff. Take a look at

609
01:55:02,890 --> 01:55:10,260
the computer. Chop. You have two grams of speed. I would like to buy some. Your bank account is now

610
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:21,159
available. Check the bank app to see your expenses and account balance. Okay. I have nine. Wait,

Subscription to film flicks. Horn master's account. I get my celtra security and then $63

614
01:55:53,210 --> 01:56:01,210
at the grocery store. I got $950 here. Yep. Cryptocurrency Bitcoin wallet for the good stuff

615
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:08,250
here. Illegal stuff. You can buy cryptocurrency from certain shady vendors. In theory, it's been

616
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:21,699
de-legalized by the U.S. a few years back, but yeah. $18 for one PTC. Would have been great to

617
01:56:21,699 --> 01:56:29,510
buy at those levels. God, if only I could grab a time machine. I would buy 10,000 million of those

618
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:42,970
things. Okay. So I have speed. It's bad, but I still have it. Emma, what is this filler test shit?

619
01:56:42,970 --> 01:56:51,210
This is not what I expected. Bring me something better next time. What is this filler test shit?

620
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:57,130
Bring me something better. This is filler shit. Okay. I'll get you something fine. I got you.

621
01:56:57,770 --> 01:57:31,659
Don't worry. I got you guys. I'll give you something better. I have to powder this.

622
01:57:32,619 --> 01:58:19,079
I don't have a mill. Here we go. 3.98 grams. Shit. I have to add. Okay. Add 0.2 grams to this.

623
01:58:19,079 --> 01:58:32,119
No! No, this is 4.9 grams of unregulated shit. New! Made with real amphetamine.

624
01:58:33,939 --> 01:58:55,100
Um, okay. They both want two, right? Two, two. There's a little bit extra there. Who cares?

625
01:58:58,149 --> 01:59:07,609
Try this new recipe. It was what? Two? Two grams? What do you want? What does Chop want? Two grams?

626
01:59:08,489 --> 01:59:16,810
Two grams? Two grams of marijuana. Oh, fuck. I need, I need marijuana. Oh shit. This has to be real

627
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:36,649
too. Great. All right. Let's go. I guess I've been waiting for a long time. All right. Try my new

628
01:59:36,649 --> 01:59:48,199
recipe. Emma, look. I promise this one's better. I got it. Here it is. Two gram pack of new made

629
01:59:48,199 --> 02:00:01,859
with real amphetamine. Try it. Tell me what you think. Except it's only made with one.

630
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:36,170
Donald, how are you? Uh, you want marijuana? I got it for you. Level four. Who buys two grams of weed?

631
02:00:37,930 --> 02:01:08,630
That guy. Here. Wait. Damn it. I need to abandon farm. Can I like search this place?

632
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:33,270
Will there be supplies? How'd you have a boat in here? All right. Well, this place is dumb. All

633
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:53,270
right. Back to the house. And then I'm going to try to unlock that new thing. What? Oh, behavior

634
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:56,710
looks carried backpack or the intensity of crime in the area may affect the decision. Try to stay

635
02:01:56,710 --> 02:02:08,300
nice and calm around police. Don't run from them. I'm good. I just have $70 in my pocket.

636
02:02:14,489 --> 02:02:33,779
I am running. Money is illegal. Book it. Money's against the law. Where's your credit card?

637
02:02:38,329 --> 02:02:49,140
I need to. Okay. Let's see. I need two grams of speed. They did not just give it to you.

638
02:02:49,859 --> 02:02:58,460
All right. Let's take a look at the desktop. I need the old marketplace. I need,

639
02:02:58,460 --> 02:03:04,390
I need 700 respect. You'd be level four. I need more respect.

640
02:03:06,569 --> 02:03:19,000
All right. So we set a new price. Right. Is that charge?

641
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:32,520
Did I drop the, should I make the price higher? All right. It's now $15. Prices might be too high.

642
02:03:33,159 --> 02:03:45,979
12.5. How many of your sale prices exceed your reputation? Oh, fuck. How about 11?

643
02:03:46,699 --> 02:04:01,750
How about cheaper? No. Give it a 12. 11 for weed. That's too high. 10. Prices are still too low.

644
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:18,380
How about 10.0.1? All right. No, 10.2. Okay. It has to be in. All right. Nevermind. Look,

645
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:28,550
my prices are considered low. All right. I'll get you speed. How much actual drugs do I have?

646
02:04:29,189 --> 02:04:45,140
What is even on here? Like, what is this? One, it's one gram. This is the, someone's going to

647
02:04:45,140 --> 02:04:55,829
hate this. All right. I'm going to give this to somebody for free. Package product. Package

648
02:04:55,829 --> 02:05:18,420
mass extends source mass. What? No, stop. What am I supposed to do about this?

649
02:05:18,899 --> 02:05:30,420
Add flour. This is for me. Like, how do I package it? I can't even take it.

650
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:48,949
Source is different substance. All right. Put it in here. I'm going to make this red. So I know

651
02:05:48,949 --> 02:05:56,539
like this is just junk. Make a meth cake. Stop. Okay. I have six grams of marijuana.

652
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:01,340
I have 12 grams of marijuana and then two almost. Okay. We'll take this one.

653
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:14,949
I need a two grams. So that guy wants it. Heard you sell amphetamine. I need three. Urgent.

It's police hours, but I can't, I have to, I'll go for it. This is, I get extra respect if I do this,

778
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:56,219
you find it, let me know. Should I file a report for that? And then the cop looks at you like,

786
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:59,719
I'm going to, it's going to dwindle down to, it'll be, finally it'll be diluted enough.

787
02:34:01,079 --> 02:34:09,100
Yeah. Finally it'll be diluted enough to be like, uh, homeopathy, right? I'm making homeopathic

788
02:34:10,059 --> 02:34:24,340
amphetamine. You guys think this is a cop? I've been selling to this guy for like the last two

789
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:34,100
or three weeks. The less of the drug, the more that it works. Yeah. Eventually I was going to

790
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:40,340
put this cocaine, this amphetamine into a water, one grain and then shake it up and then sell it

791
02:34:40,340 --> 02:34:48,819
to people. Okay. I need to go give the guy the weed, but I need to sleep. I have $108 in my hand.

792
02:34:49,620 --> 02:35:05,290
Where does he live? He's right there. All right. Then after this, I'm turning it off. I'm not,

793
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:11,110
no, not turning the game off. I'm turning off my eyes. I'm going to close my eyes and turn it off

794
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:15,559
and like go to sleep and then wake up tomorrow and do it again. Like I'm going to just turn,

795
02:35:15,559 --> 02:35:17,559
I'm going to go to sleep is what I'm saying. What I'm telling you.

796
02:35:46,549 --> 02:36:25,959
Chuff run. Oh, all right. Have a nice night. How many times have I been arrested?

797
02:36:26,600 --> 02:36:34,649
I didn't have anything on me, man. Ah, it's all right. I made it back. Oh, that's a lot of money.

798
02:36:34,649 --> 02:36:41,190
I guess I can't do that anymore. I can't get caught. Hey, at least it's daytime now. Yeah,

799
02:36:41,190 --> 02:36:49,530
that's true. Um, Hey, you wait. Oh, fuck you. I just got out. You just let me out. I just got

800
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:57,620
out of jail. You just let me out of jail. Stand still, please. You guys. It's all the two of you

801
02:36:57,620 --> 02:37:01,219
guys from yesterday. By the way, when you booked me, I didn't have anything on me. All right.

802
02:37:01,219 --> 02:37:21,020
That's what I thought. Oh, leave me alone. But you ran. I wasn't running. Let me ran. Did you see

803
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:25,899
inside of my shoes after that? It was there were hornets in my shoes, like a dozen hornets in each

804
02:37:25,899 --> 02:37:28,700
shoe. And I was freaking out trying to get them out of here. I'm trying to run, crush them on them.

805
02:37:28,700 --> 02:37:56,569
I was trying to crush them running. Please. Hi, how are we doing? I was trying to make mashed

806
02:37:56,569 --> 02:38:02,569
potatoes. Yeah, I was trying this new socks technique where instead of socks, I smear

807
02:38:02,569 --> 02:38:10,809
mashed potatoes all over my bare feet and then put them in shoes. But then, sir, wouldn't they already

808
02:38:10,809 --> 02:38:31,620
be mashed potatoes then? Yeah, they would be. He's running. Old marketplace unlocked. Unlock.

809
02:38:33,299 --> 02:38:39,510
Okay, old marketplace has been unlocked. Emma, I heard that you sell amphetamine.

810
02:38:39,510 --> 02:38:49,110
I need it urgently. All right. Well, how many? I need ganja. Okay. Where it's starting to spread

811
02:38:49,110 --> 02:38:54,899
that I got the best shit in town. I need to reorganize. This looks ugly and I hate it.

812
02:38:55,379 --> 02:39:04,069
This looks this looks ugly and I don't like it. Small jars are going to go up here.

813
02:39:08,149 --> 02:39:12,860
Oh, there's something in that. Okay. Media. There's a medium amphetamine bake. Well,

814
02:39:12,860 --> 02:39:18,579
I got to put baking soda in one of these is important. Okay, draw. Let's put this.

815
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:29,219
I need to put you in here. Yeah, this is the baking soda jar. Take it white. All right,

816
02:39:29,219 --> 02:39:45,319
the sugar is just going to go up here. How do I move it? I just want to move it.

817
02:39:45,319 --> 02:40:02,809
Why can I not move this? Am I stupid or something? It's too heavy. Lab mode.

818
02:40:04,969 --> 02:40:14,620
Isn't it drug placement mode? Pick up sugar. F. Handle objects switch to lab mode. Okay.

819
02:40:17,620 --> 02:40:23,530
Pick up drug placement. Pick up sugar. Pick up amphetamine.

820
02:40:28,629 --> 02:40:37,180
I'm going to put this in here. It is amphetamine in there. Let's put the mixed stuff in here.

821
02:40:37,659 --> 02:40:54,860
It's 0.87 of the mixture. I can't move this. Yeah, I guess if I press F on an object,

822
02:40:54,860 --> 02:41:05,879
but I can't press F on the sugar. Sugar is too powerful to move. Okay. What do people need?

823
02:41:06,520 --> 02:41:18,250
No messages. Nobody cares. All right, we need three grams of marijuana and then,

824
02:41:19,129 --> 02:41:23,879
hey there, I got an idea. Would love to work for you and help you sell more of your great stuff.

825
02:41:23,879 --> 02:41:31,559
How about that? Oh, this guy wants to hire as a dealer. Yeah. How much is here? You've just

826
02:41:31,559 --> 02:41:36,840
hired your first dealer. Congrats. Dealers order the dope just like any other clients,

827
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:42,760
but a lot more progressively. Okay. The thing is that they pay up after they distribute,

828
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:52,010
so take that into consideration. All right. So go get some orders for me, man. All right,

829
02:41:52,010 --> 02:42:00,780
so three grams of ganja and four grams of amphetamine. What do we got? This is amphetamine.

830
02:42:00,780 --> 02:42:08,649
What's in there? Do we have any amphetamines in there? Okay. So what have I got in my mixture?

831
02:42:08,649 --> 02:42:22,659
Okay. Let's go ahead and put this in here. Let's do, yeah, put the six. No, put two, three here.

832
02:42:23,610 --> 02:42:43,500
Now four. Mix that up. That's all mixed up. Now we have our 4.8. Okay, so that's all. That's now

833
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:49,860
we can mix that. Put that away and let's package that up. We'll put the trash that comes up from

834
02:42:49,860 --> 02:42:56,739
underneath it back into the trash box. There we go. So here's like the leftover fucking gross mix.

835
02:42:56,739 --> 02:43:05,049
We're going to do this until it's gone. Okay. So I've got my amphetamine. Now I need my weed.

836
02:43:05,690 --> 02:43:16,729
It's three grams, right? I can't fit an inventory. Why not? Oh, I need to buy a backpack.

837
02:43:17,370 --> 02:43:26,139
All right. I need to buy a backpack first. Put this in the cabinet. I need money. Let's take out

841
02:44:03,739 --> 02:44:09,209

02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:10,229

02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:26,409
Oh, I can't take the salt or get rid of the acetone. So new social security payment. Hey,

882
02:59:16,069 --> 02:59:24,889

02:59:39,559 --> 02:59:53,290
Let me just drink some water. Two speed, three weed, one baking soda, two eggs. This is a mess

886
02:59:53,290 --> 03:00:00,709

03:00:16,569 --> 03:00:28,809
Wait. What actually? What? What actually is it though? It's about five. So that's three,

891
03:00:44,149 --> 03:00:51,379
And then we need... I almost had it. Fuck. And we need 11s. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

892
03:00:51,379 --> 03:00:58,969

893
03:00:58,969 --> 03:01:07,479
to go back and look at the fucking laptop again. It was four. Okay. So five, six, seven, eight,

894
03:01:07,479 --> 03:01:20,170

You want the bag of two. So I had it right. Why can't you just fucking order it? I only

897
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:48,819
sell in bags of five. Okay. Can I just... Can I make that clear? I don't have enough. All right.

898
03:01:48,819 --> 03:02:03,340
Whatever. All right. Let's accept all these on my way. Emma, you wanted the fucking amphetamine.

899
03:02:03,340 --> 03:02:13,290
Okay. You wanted the two grams. That's fine. You wanted... Who wanted four? Who wanted the four grams?

905
03:03:56,540 --> 03:04:02,870
What are you talking about, George? It's the biggest scheme. I just realized it. Okay. Hold on.

906
03:04:02,870 --> 03:04:22,020
What do you want? Five? Take it. Go deal. And you. My backpack. My backpack. I found my backpack.

It's there. I got it back. I'm so happy. Yes. Okay. How does it go into my inventory? I got my...

908
03:04:34,379 --> 03:04:46,620
Wait. I have to go. I have to get my package first. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Hey. Stay right there. I

909
03:04:46,620 --> 03:04:58,819
can give you something. You want something? Here. Wait. I've got a present for you. Here. All right.

910
03:04:58,819 --> 03:05:10,280
See you later. No drug dealers ever acted like this. What? Being excited that you found a lost

911
03:05:10,280 --> 03:05:43,100
package? A dig? Oh. What do you want? You want two grams of amphetamine. I have it in this bag.

912
03:05:43,739 --> 03:05:52,139
There's amphetamine in this bag. Why can't I... How do I open... How do I use this backpack?

913
03:05:52,139 --> 03:06:02,170
There's amphetamine in here. Can't put a backpack in items with a backpack.

914
03:06:02,170 --> 03:06:34,649
Swap the bag. All right. Yeah. I'll have to carry this. Wait. I've just seen this shit. Okay. Hold

915
03:06:34,889 --> 03:06:50,360
on. One gram. How much money is in here? I can't consolidate? Put the cash in my hands. Okay. All

916
03:06:50,360 --> 03:07:08,020
right. This backpack... This backpack is empty. Wait. I need to empty this one. What? No. I don't

917
03:07:08,020 --> 03:07:20,729
want to put the backpack in the backpack. How do you fit a medium backpack inside of a small backpack?

918
03:07:20,729 --> 03:07:37,719
Whatever. What does this guy want? He's going to get two different types of products. Wait. I think

919
03:07:37,719 --> 03:07:50,299
this is the cool kids area. Hey, you. Medium backpack. All right. I have one pack of this

920
03:07:50,299 --> 03:08:02,149
gross shit here for free. How can I help you? I want to buy something. Oh. Give me one of these.

921
03:08:04,040 --> 03:08:12,950
Yeah. I'll take two of them. No. I'll take some small jars. Nice. Okay. Cool. Yeah. And then I'll

922
03:08:12,950 --> 03:08:29,750
take a... I'll take one of those medium jars. Okay. Send it to my apartment. Thanks a lot.

923
03:08:32,299 --> 03:08:42,899
Oh, wow. I didn't know you existed. Hi. You the dealer? I am. You were looking for two grams of

924
03:08:42,899 --> 03:09:05,299
amphetamine. Uh-oh. I gave one of those away. And here. Here's the going value of one bag.

925
03:09:16,219 --> 03:09:43,959
Take it. Something wrong? I forgot something. What did you forget? The drugs.

926
03:09:47,299 --> 03:10:00,069
Hey, man. I see that you're selling a... You're selling a TV? Yeah. I'm selling a TV. Cool.

927
03:10:01,270 --> 03:10:05,110
$100 for the TV, right? Yep. That's me. I'm selling $100 for the TV.

928
03:10:06,069 --> 03:10:12,680
Okay. What do you want to meet? Bob's Grocery Store. It's close to me.

929
03:10:12,680 --> 03:10:15,899
Oh, that's close to me, too. It's only a couple of miles away. Yeah, sure.

930
03:10:16,459 --> 03:10:19,420
All right. I'll see you there at 2 o'clock. 2 o'clock. That's perfect for me.

931
03:10:20,219 --> 03:10:28,979
2.05. 2.02. I'm a little late getting up to Bob's Grocery Store. Not here. He's probably

932
03:10:29,620 --> 03:10:35,639
just like at a light or something. And now it's 2.28. Still not here.

933
03:10:39,610 --> 03:10:47,260
Hey, Dan. Are you here? Are you coming? Are you on your way? Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Okay.

934
03:10:48,219 --> 03:10:58,920
You're still doing this, right? You have a TV? Yeah. 3.45. A pickup truck pulls in. That must

935
03:10:58,920 --> 03:11:07,340
be him. Get out of the car and see who it is. Hey. Hey, you've got the TV? Yeah. Where is it?

936
03:11:07,340 --> 03:11:11,579
It's out of the house. I figured we were going to meet here and then you could drive back to the

937
03:11:11,579 --> 03:11:15,899
house and get it. It's kind of hard to put in a truck, so I figured we could just meet and you

938
03:11:15,899 --> 03:11:21,510
could come back. I don't want to do that. What are you talking about? You don't want to do that.

939
03:11:21,510 --> 03:11:27,079
Fucking asshole. You're an asshole. No, you're a fucking asshole. I told you the TV's too big

940
03:11:27,079 --> 03:11:36,709
to put in my truck. It's a 30-inch TV and I have a small four-door like Chevy Malibu.

941
03:11:36,709 --> 03:11:48,090
Yeah, but just come back to my house. This is a really good joke. I know. I'm aware of that.

942
03:11:48,420 --> 03:12:01,319
Is this a joke or a movie? Is this a joke or a movie? It's just like a podcast, like a play,

943
03:12:01,319 --> 03:12:12,360
like an old radio play. And then the aliens pulled up in the war of the worlds and a nuke

944
03:12:12,360 --> 03:12:24,010
started to fall. This is a movie. I don't know. I was still going. I still had it.

945
03:12:24,969 --> 03:12:38,120
I was still having fun with it. All right, back to... What was that noise? That was like an explosion

946
03:12:38,120 --> 03:12:46,620
in my... What was that? Oh, that was this. Okay, let's go. I have some clients here that are waiting

947
03:12:46,620 --> 03:13:00,579
for stuff. Here we go. Let's put the sugar back here. The baking soda marijuana. Here we go. We've

948
03:13:00,579 --> 03:13:04,979
got 20 grams. Let's put the marijuana up here for fun, just because we want to look at it,

949
03:13:04,979 --> 03:13:14,299
look at our stash. Okay. What is on here already? Some junk. Let's do... Oh, I got my... Didn't I

950
03:13:14,299 --> 03:13:33,530
get my new things? Oh, nice. There it is. I put this. Okay. And then we'll put the jars up here.

951
03:13:33,530 --> 03:13:43,690
Give me a moment. I'm working. Stop. Shut up. I'm working. All right, let's take the salt.

952
03:13:45,420 --> 03:13:51,100
Okay, lab mode. Salt in here. The sauce is already powdered. Oh, well, okay. Let's just add it then.

953
03:13:52,059 --> 03:14:04,579
Now, I want to make a new mixture. Get this out of here. Move this. Okay, salt. 30 grams. That's a

954
03:14:04,579 --> 03:14:12,459
lot. I did like the restaurant dumb prank bullshit joke. Okay. The stupidest... Okay, salt. Sugar.

955
03:14:14,170 --> 03:14:22,180
Crush it up. Can't add any more substance. Why? Oh, because it can only hold 30. All right,

956
03:14:22,180 --> 03:14:46,790
put it back in the box. Put it in here. Just salt. Salt. I want sugar, salt.

957
03:14:47,590 --> 03:14:54,739
But how do you make the Powerpuff Girls? I got to be careful. Otherwise, there's going to be three

958
03:14:54,739 --> 03:14:59,700
extremely powerful mutant teenage girls that are going to fucking be able to... I got to be careful

959
03:14:59,700 --> 03:15:15,700
here. Sugar, spice, and everything. Nice. All right. What are you talking about? That's in the

960
03:15:15,700 --> 03:15:49,340
mill. All right, mill it. It takes a long time. I just like knotted up. 14 grams of salt and then

961
03:15:49,979 --> 03:16:01,420
14 grams of sugar. Salt, sugar, and one gram of cocaine. These were the secret ingredients that

962
03:16:01,420 --> 03:16:24,870
Professor X put into his pot of stuff and he created the Crack Girls. Oh, wow. Did they fight

963
03:16:24,870 --> 03:16:35,370
crime? Nope. Not at all. In fact, just now, they've robbed and killed Professor X.

964
03:16:37,780 --> 03:16:43,879
And the credits just fucking screamed by and there was like 12,000 people that worked on it.

965
03:16:43,879 --> 03:16:58,819
All right, here we go. Let's mix this up. Sugar, salt. This is just fucking... This seriously is

966
03:16:58,819 --> 03:17:06,899
just like a drug rub. Sugar, salt, amphetamine, baking, so should I put some washing detergent in there?

967
03:17:06,899 --> 03:17:18,600
That was a good adult swim robot chicken joke. Whatever. Who cares? This can't be empty. What do

968
03:17:18,600 --> 03:17:37,540
you mean this can't be empty? Oh, there you go. Here is my dry rub. This is 30 grams. Someone's

969
03:17:37,540 --> 03:17:43,700
going to kill me. I'm going to get attacked over this. People are going to kill me. I need to give

970
03:17:43,700 --> 03:18:12,659
weapons. I'm going to be like in trouble. I have 29 grams of the dry rub. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait.

971
03:18:12,659 --> 03:18:29,379
What if I just crush up the ibuprofen and just sell ibuprofen? Oh, what's this? Oh, the sugar.

972
03:18:29,379 --> 03:18:39,780
Right. Put the sugar over here. I don't know. There's only 20. Put this in here. All right,

973
03:18:39,860 --> 03:18:56,180
ibuprofen pills. All right, I'll crush them up. Oh, what? Okay, here, over here. Okay,

974
03:18:56,739 --> 03:19:11,739
ibuprofen and... Okay, ibuprofen. Package it. Oh, okay, fine. Just mix it. All right, ibuprofen.

975
03:19:11,739 --> 03:19:18,649
All right, guys, I can just tell this is a headache cure. You know what I mean? God,

976
03:19:18,649 --> 03:19:26,500
I got a headache. Hey, I've got a headache cure. You do? Yep. Oh, you can cure my headache? Yes,

977
03:19:26,500 --> 03:19:49,579
I can. Okay, well, now I have a lot of product. Let's go get ourselves attacked by a bunch of

978
03:19:49,579 --> 03:19:55,129
people. Ready with the money in delivery. Let me know. Yeah, let's meet. I want that cash.

979
03:19:55,850 --> 03:20:01,610
All right, we need weed. Oh, I'd like to... I got some contacts that could help you distribute.

980
03:20:01,610 --> 03:20:13,020
Yeah, let's go. On it. All right, so we need marijuana. We need five grams of marijuana,

981
03:20:13,020 --> 03:20:34,790
three, and then two. Three, two, two. How much marijuana do I have? Perfect. Not perfect. I need

982
03:20:34,790 --> 03:20:50,379
one more. Ah, what do I? What do you mean, wet substance? Just run it under the sink.

983
03:20:50,940 --> 03:20:59,829
Just hold it under the sink for a second. What do you mean, dry? Do I have to put like...

984
03:21:00,549 --> 03:21:08,680
Well, I have to put it like... Why? Do I have to put it like a soda? All right, whatever. I'll do that

985
03:21:08,680 --> 03:21:22,010
guy later. All right, we're going to be delivering soon. I can do you, and I can do you. You on the

986
03:21:22,010 --> 03:21:25,770
other hand, I'm sorry, but I cannot get it for you. Let's take a look at the inventory here.

987
03:21:26,409 --> 03:21:31,290
Look at all this stuff I got, and I got skill points. You've got it. Okay, I want to do...

988
03:21:33,049 --> 03:21:53,110
We need something better than just illusionist. All right, I'm a pretty good illusionist. Okay,

989
03:21:53,909 --> 03:22:09,819
addict at least five clients to your product. Oh, okay. Dr. Germa. Just got ibuprofen.

990
03:22:10,540 --> 03:22:17,770
All right, first one is we got to go meet the dealer. No police, right? We're good.

991
03:22:21,799 --> 03:22:30,469
How you doing? Are you a stranger? No police. We're good. All right, here we go. You're the dealer.

992
03:22:30,469 --> 03:22:34,469
I do have the dope. You're looking for two grams of marijuana. I'll give it to you. This is actually

993
03:22:34,469 --> 03:22:39,979
real. I promise. Now, if your dealer says, I guarantee you, I promise you, this is real.

994
03:22:40,620 --> 03:22:46,250
Find a new dealer. Or just in fact, don't do drugs at all. Because drugs, you know, why do I

995
03:22:46,250 --> 03:23:05,209
don't do drugs? There's an electric box in here. All right, but you picked the worst possible spot

996
03:23:05,209 --> 03:23:13,030
to meet, man. All right, give me my money. Give it to me. 60 bucks. You can do better than that.

997
03:23:13,030 --> 03:23:23,670
When I was out here fucking dropping, I was making $150 a day. $60. You can do way better than that.

998
03:23:23,670 --> 03:23:50,860
And then change that tie too. And now we got to go to over here to Donald. Here's Donald. No police.

999
03:23:51,579 --> 03:24:03,420
All right, here you go, Donald. One of the three grams. You got it. It's back for me. All right.

1000
03:24:04,219 --> 03:24:17,319
So, the question now is, I have to go back to the house. Put this money into my money safe.

1001
03:24:22,090 --> 03:24:45,930
Ronald Duck is a quack dealer. Not bad. That wasn't bad. Okay. So, what do we got? What's the

1002
03:24:45,930 --> 03:24:53,659
what's up? What's the goal here? 800 respect and you get level six on it. All right. Cool.

1003
03:24:55,370 --> 03:25:04,600
You want two grams of marijuana, but I don't have it. I need more marijuana. I need. Yeah,

1004
03:25:04,600 --> 03:25:12,600
we'll just do 10 grams. That's fine. Also, how much do I owe you? $190. Do I have that?

1005
03:25:13,319 --> 03:25:33,030
Holy shit. What do I have? I have ibuprofen. All right. I got to get the. Wait, how do I take the

1006
03:25:33,030 --> 03:25:45,450
backpack out of here? I have to do this. All right. Now I can put this shit away. Put this one on.

1007
03:25:46,600 --> 03:26:01,430
There we go. Take the spray paint. Money in here. Take out 190 bucks. Close enough.

1008
03:26:03,450 --> 03:26:10,040
Dry rub, cash, ibuprofen. All right. Let's take some ibuprofen out. Why? There's no reason to do

1009
03:26:10,040 --> 03:26:19,370
that. Okay. No, let's take it. I'm going to, if I get stopped, I'm going to be in big trouble.

1010
03:26:19,370 --> 03:26:31,059
No. I'll spray some paint. By the way, for the delivery. What about the free sell the small

1011
03:26:31,059 --> 03:26:40,229
backpack? How? But I can sell the small backpack? Like, can I sell the ibuprofen? But it's ibuprofen.

1012
03:26:41,030 --> 03:26:47,659
Yeah. But it's, it's crushed up. I'm probably going to tell somebody. That'd be something. I

1013
03:26:47,659 --> 03:26:52,459
know. But that's not illegal to have ibuprofen, but to have it crushed up in a mill? In a baggie?

1014
03:26:53,420 --> 03:27:04,899
You don't think there's something wrong with that? All right. There's Eddie. Let's pay him.

1015
03:27:04,899 --> 03:27:14,489
What is this one? Good. I've had one new available message. I think for the whole game.

1016
03:27:25,340 --> 03:27:42,440
Oh fuck. This has to be a bug. All right, Eddie. All right. Package is there. It's the marijuana.

1017
03:27:43,000 --> 03:28:04,379
Where is it? Far away. You're not cool enough. Yes, I am. Hey, come over here,

1018
03:28:04,379 --> 03:28:11,819
pal. Oh, I have ibuprofen. I have bad headaches. Are you carrying any drugs or weapons? Yes,

1019
03:28:11,819 --> 03:28:23,459
it's ibuprofen. It's a drug, technically. Okay. Now you're fucked, buddy. It's ibuprofen. It's

1020
03:28:23,459 --> 03:28:35,079
Tylenol. What did they take? They took the, they took the ibuprofen and they took the money.

1021
03:28:35,079 --> 03:29:06,250
Fucking dicks. Do you have anything new? Wait. Okay. Here. This is, I need one of these.

1022
03:29:06,969 --> 03:29:20,280
I gotta take money out of the fucking ATM. Where's this shitty ATM? There's not even an ATM over here.

1023
03:29:20,280 --> 03:29:52,569
Of course not. All right. Let's go get the package and then go home. I'm waiting for the train.

1024
03:30:00,409 --> 03:30:18,709
Oh, what are you one of those hunters? Get out of here, you bastard. That was funny. That actually

1025
03:30:18,709 --> 03:30:23,829
was funny. That's the Yarnham. That was funny. That was funny. I know it was. And you can tell

1026
03:30:23,829 --> 03:30:31,799
me it wasn't. I don't believe you. It was funny. That was funny. It was very, very funny. I mean,

1027
03:30:31,799 --> 03:30:35,799
like I thought it was, I thought it was really good. I thought it was really funny.

1028
03:30:37,559 --> 03:30:50,940
All right. Where the hell did I? What? Can I not go in the furniture shop? Why?

1029
03:30:51,739 --> 03:31:05,219
I don't have enough respect to go to the furniture shopping. Now take out, take out 500. No,

1030
03:31:05,219 --> 03:31:23,829
take out 250. All right. This is the package. You gotta go. No shit. They took it. Right. I was

1031
03:31:23,829 --> 03:31:52,440
going to give him ibuprofen. No. Fuck off. Where are they? All right. I'm out. Now this guy wants

1032
03:31:52,440 --> 03:32:07,909
the, I think we lost that customer. So here's back home. Shit. You gonna get a bad Yelp review?

1033
03:32:08,870 --> 03:32:31,829
I don't care. More spray painting. Please laugh. In quotes. Jerma 2020. I didn't say please laugh.

1034
03:32:31,829 --> 03:32:37,110
I said, I thought that was funny. I didn't say please laugh. I said, I thought that was funny.

1035
03:32:37,750 --> 03:33:01,290
So how do you know if a door is unlockable? Is there anyone to tell? All right. And now I have

1036
03:33:01,290 --> 03:33:23,899
drugs. I'm ready to start selling drugs again. Go with the cops. I've never seen any of these

1037
03:33:23,899 --> 03:33:31,079
robbers, violent people, drinking people. Where are they? I haven't come across any of them.

1038
03:33:31,079 --> 03:33:46,940
All right. Give me my computer. Package is waiting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Emma,

1039
03:33:46,940 --> 03:34:02,540
I need 16 grams of marijuana. What the fuck? 10. There's one in there. I have 11.

1040
03:34:05,100 --> 03:34:20,219
Getting me. Do I seriously need to buy another one? This guy wants two. You want 16. Well,

1041
03:34:20,219 --> 03:34:28,520
I need to do another order. I'll just, let's give me, give me 20 so I can have it.

1042
03:34:29,159 --> 03:34:35,299
No, you know what? Fucking give me more than that. Give me, give me like 30 so I can always have it.

1043
03:34:50,469 --> 03:35:04,809
What? 10. Oh, I have two. 12. What the hell is in all this? There's sugar in here. There's salt in

1044
03:35:04,809 --> 03:35:13,000
here. Sugar in here. I need to move these things. It's occupied. I can't move it. Sugar, salt,

1045
03:35:13,559 --> 03:35:24,389
sugar, nothing, dry rub, and then 0.84 of the baking soda cocaine crack mix thing.

1046
03:35:25,610 --> 03:35:44,969
And then there's one gram of marijuana in here. All right. Get it out here. Take it out in lab

1047
03:35:44,969 --> 03:36:02,549
mode. Just give it to me. All right. So we've got 10, 11, 12, 13, and then we have 19 amphetamine.

1048
03:36:02,549 --> 03:36:15,180
We have a bunch of our dry rubs in the, where's our dryer? Back here. Yeah. Uh, we need two grams

1049
03:36:15,180 --> 03:36:23,860
of grass, two grams of grass, 16 grams. Uh, your drops coming in 45 minutes. I know what to do

1050
03:36:23,860 --> 03:36:42,760
about that. Okay. What is this new baking soda mix shit? This is not what I expected.

1051
03:36:44,360 --> 03:36:53,370
That's the last text. All right. Two, two. Everyone wants, uh, okay. You want just speed.

1052
03:36:54,010 --> 03:36:57,850
You want marijuana. So the plan here is I'm going to bring,

1053
03:36:58,809 --> 03:37:02,059
I'm going to get the, this is going to be very, very, I'm going to be, this is going to be bad.

1054
03:37:02,059 --> 03:37:11,459
This is going to be very bad. Two grams. So we need four grams of marijuana, three grams of speed,

1055
03:37:11,459 --> 03:37:19,430
which we're going to bring our, you know, what we're going to bring. I'm going to bring like

1056
03:37:19,430 --> 03:37:37,590
six. Okay. So let's bring, uh, there's three. Activate this workstation. Let's put, um,

1057
03:37:37,590 --> 03:37:44,809
it's that bag, the big one, bring this over here. It's just about, I can't cut this. I need

1058
03:37:44,809 --> 03:37:55,110
to, I want to, I only, I want to cut this up. Come here. Put it in here. Okay. Now give it to me.

1059
03:38:00,579 --> 03:38:10,200
All right. Let's let's like the orders. 16 grams of marijuana. It's in that box. I'm going to bring

1060
03:38:10,200 --> 03:38:22,870
it to her. This guy still hasn't done anything. Two grams, three grams of speed. So I need two,

1061
03:38:22,870 --> 03:38:31,510
two, and then 16. What do I have now? Two, two, and then I need 16. Okay. I'm ready. Let's go.

1062
03:38:32,229 --> 03:38:43,639
Please for the love of God, don't stop me. I'm going to get that fucking package.

1063
03:38:44,280 --> 03:39:01,979
This is going to be a disaster if I get stopped. I need two more grams. Do I? Well, I'm going to

1064
03:39:01,979 --> 03:39:11,959
get them from, uh, the package. All right. You wanted amphetamine. So here's your drive rub.

1065
03:39:14,729 --> 03:39:21,209
He's going to hate this. I'm going to get after a little while. I don't know how much longer this

1066
03:39:21,209 --> 03:39:26,020
is going to take for me to get hurt. Okay. The package is right there. Let's do that.

1067
03:39:31,059 --> 03:39:59,620
All right. What's that package? Give me the package. Give me, give me, give me, give me,

1068
03:39:59,620 --> 03:40:07,579
give me, give me, give me. There it is. That's 30 grams of marijuana. All right. Don't fucking

1069
03:40:07,579 --> 03:40:16,950
get stopped. The deal is right there. Holy shit. People are giving subs. I'm sorry. I've been locked

1070
03:40:16,950 --> 03:40:23,430
in. Bull myth gave 10 community subs and then tipped over. Just gave five. Thanks for the subs

1071
03:40:23,430 --> 03:40:31,399
guys. Also, uh, Fez. Thank you Fez for the five community subs. Thanks all of you for those big

1072
03:40:31,399 --> 03:40:42,889
fucking sub drops. Seriously. You need 16 grams. So here's a pack of 10, a pack of two. So that's

1073
03:40:42,889 --> 03:40:55,700
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Fuck. Can I over give? I'm just taking both. Take two of them. This is not

1074
03:40:55,700 --> 03:41:06,620
what they expect. The product must have the expected quantity. Shit. Really? I can't just

1075
03:41:06,620 --> 03:41:26,620
give it back to me. Two, three, wait, two, three, four, five, 15. You want 16. No. Oh, something's

1076
03:41:26,620 --> 03:41:47,659
wrong. Oh, I'll be right back. Just add one dry rub. She's not going to take it. I'm just going

1077
03:41:47,659 --> 03:42:01,670
to do the ones that are already here. They both take over here. Just put some barbecue sauce on it.

1078
03:42:04,250 --> 03:42:19,270
Where the hell is this person? What the fuck are you? Wait, what? And where is this? Where are you?

1079
03:42:21,610 --> 03:42:47,420
Oh, you weird spot, man. I do have the dope. Here it is. Two grams of marijuana. Oh, all right.

1080
03:42:48,469 --> 03:43:00,219
Now I need to go back to the house and cut this shit. This guy's got massive hands. Kind of.

1081
03:43:04,579 --> 03:43:16,950
Magically, I have not, no one's attempted to rob me somehow. How has nobody tried to kill me yet?

1082
03:43:17,510 --> 03:43:31,399
Okay, here we go. Activate the station. Currently holding eight grams of marijuana.

1083
03:43:32,040 --> 03:43:41,530
Please, if you could package up six of those, that would be wonderful. Thank you very much.

1084
03:43:41,530 --> 03:43:49,049
Okay. Have a great day. Goodbye. Now I have 10, 16. Very cool. I'm going to store these. I don't

1085
03:43:49,049 --> 03:43:53,530
want to bring them all. Wait, anybody else want marijuana? Who else wants a marijuana?

1086
03:43:54,170 --> 03:44:02,059
Five grams of, oh, I need five. Yeah, I got it. And I need a five, four grams. So yeah,

1087
03:44:02,059 --> 03:44:23,989
I got that dry rub for you. Got it. Bring a bunch. Okay. I'm ready. Let's go. Make them all one gram.

1088
03:44:23,989 --> 03:44:28,709
Yeah, but it's fun to do the math that I can't do. All right, Emma, let's go. Take this huge

1089
03:44:28,709 --> 03:44:33,610
amount of marijuana and make me some money. Get rid of the extra weed. What if I want to give

1090
03:44:33,610 --> 03:44:52,780
it to somebody for free? You know, what if I want to give it a free sample? Is you 16. Oh,

1091
03:44:52,780 --> 03:45:12,040
make me some money. You're definitely not a drug dealer. What do you mean? Hey, partner, you got it.

1092
03:45:12,040 --> 03:45:17,829
Yep, I do. You want five grams of amphetamine. Here you go. Let me know how the customers like

1093
03:45:17,829 --> 03:45:46,790
the dry rub. See what they have to say. Another door that's here for no reason. How many no reason

1094
03:45:46,790 --> 03:46:18,280
doors exist? Eventually, there's going to be something in one of these, right? Somebody in

1095
03:46:18,280 --> 03:46:30,760
this one though? What I'm doing is technically illegal because it's, but it's only like an

1096
03:46:30,760 --> 03:46:47,799
abandoned warehouse. There's nothing even in this. It's all empty. All right, Chop, come here.

1097
03:46:47,799 --> 03:47:01,139
Here's your four grams of amphetamine. Take that dry rub. All right, good to go. Back to house.

1098
03:47:02,260 --> 03:47:14,940
I'm making some good money at this point. It's technically illegal. Well, yeah, but it's an

1099
03:47:14,940 --> 03:47:33,899
abandoned warehouse. What if nobody owns that property? Dry rub only gets you high if you

1100
03:47:33,899 --> 03:47:47,159
watch. What do you mean if you watch? All right, let's check our emails. I need some respect.

1101
03:47:47,719 --> 03:48:04,260
My average delivery time has been really good. I need to get a level six. I'm gonna wait. Okay,

1102
03:48:04,260 --> 03:48:10,579
got some. Let's put the marijuana back in. Let's actually use one of these for not a moron purpose.

1103
03:48:11,219 --> 03:48:19,340
Take the salt out. Put the salt in one of these little jars. We'll have salt over here.

1104
03:48:21,719 --> 03:48:40,340
Salt. Can I get mustard? Can I get mustard and ketchup? Sugar is right here. Okay, we have

1105
03:48:41,350 --> 03:48:46,899
salt. Nothing. We'll move the sugar out of here. Actually, I'm gonna keep the sugar in there. That's

1106
03:48:46,899 --> 03:48:59,690
fine. This one's empty. This is gonna be weed. Oh, please. My dealer's trying to sell me ketchup.

1107
03:49:06,819 --> 03:49:16,090
Okay. I mean, it's true, but what? Marijuana. We're gonna move marijuana into this jar.

1108
03:49:21,610 --> 03:49:34,010
All marijuana goes in here. Dry rub is okay. Marijuana. In. All of it. We can put this in the

1109
03:49:34,010 --> 03:49:40,329
bags that we need later. How much does this hold? This holds 40 grams. I have 23 grams of marijuana.

1110
03:49:40,329 --> 03:49:48,840
What's in this one? Sugar. Look at all this stupid-ass sugar I have. How many things this

1111
03:49:48,840 --> 03:49:55,940
holds? Why did I buy this much sugar? What's fucking wrong with me? Amphetamine going in here. This

1112
03:49:55,940 --> 03:50:02,280
is gonna be like pink. Real amphetamine is in the pink jar. Okay, that's important.

1113
03:50:04,649 --> 03:50:19,579
I'm just gonna hold the dry rub. Okay, what do we need? Who's got something for me to do?

1114
03:50:20,299 --> 03:50:36,379
What is this dry rub shit? You got any more speed? Six grams, dude. What? You don't like my dry rub?

1115
03:50:36,940 --> 03:50:40,620
That's bullshit. All right, I'll give him something. I'll give him a real one.

1116
03:50:41,260 --> 03:50:59,100
Fine. You'll get three, four real ones and then a dry rub. And I got- how much dry rub do I have

1117
03:50:59,100 --> 03:51:05,819
in my inventory right now? So you wanted six. Two, three, four, five. All right, we'll have one more

1118
03:51:05,819 --> 03:51:26,979
dry rub. Okay, I'm waiting for another- I'm gonna go sleep after this. Give him dry rub and mustard

1119
03:51:26,979 --> 03:51:37,700
sauce. Where is this dude? He's right there. Why is everybody saying end of the stream?

1120
03:51:38,260 --> 03:51:51,500
Isn't that the end of the fucking stream? What? Okay, here you go. It's four amphetamines.

1121
03:51:51,500 --> 03:51:57,420
And then, look, I'd like you to try it again. Just give it one more try. And then you tell me

1122
03:51:57,420 --> 03:52:01,100
if you think it's gross. Did you put it on correctly? Did you put it on before you put it

1123
03:52:01,100 --> 03:52:04,860
in the oven or after? Don't tell me you're a fucking idiot and put it on after it came out

1124
03:52:04,860 --> 03:52:21,190
of the oven. Is that what you did? Because you must have used it wrong. But I can't give him- this is

1125
03:52:21,190 --> 03:52:48,549
two, four, five, six. He doesn't want it. Two, four, five, six. What? Two plus two equals six.

1126
03:52:48,549 --> 03:53:18,870
That's two plus two equals four and then five, six. I'll be right back. You don't like this shit,

1127
03:53:18,870 --> 03:53:26,840
huh? Fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't like it. I don't like it. Oh, that's gross. I don't like it.

1128
03:53:26,840 --> 03:54:51,239
Give me something better. Oh, really? Okay. We'll see. We'll see.

1129
03:55:08,680 --> 03:55:41,989
Ah, I've got something for you. Thanks for the money. Thanks for the level up as well.

1130
03:55:44,819 --> 03:56:13,530
New drug available. Ecstasy. Oh, we check your drug offer. How do I get it? How much is it? New

1131
03:56:13,530 --> 03:56:37,049
unlock. Like 10 bucks. I'm never buying from you. You used it. Wait, wasn't that my dealer?

1132
03:56:37,959 --> 03:56:51,829
Wait, that was my dealer. Hey, cash delivery. Ah, yeah. Let's take it. I'll get it. New stuff

1133
03:56:51,829 --> 03:57:01,860
is available. Ecstasy. Check it out. Oh, yeah. I'll make an order of ecstasy. I'm going to mix

1134
03:57:01,860 --> 03:57:13,370
ecstasy, amphetamine, salt, sugar, um, boogers, baking soda, salt, garlic powder, onion powder.

1135
03:57:13,370 --> 03:57:36,280
This is going to be my ultimate display. Give me some more amphetamines. All right. We got our

1136
03:57:36,360 --> 03:57:42,979
mix. I don't have any drug. Okay. Well, that's $400. Wow. That's a lot of money. I got 500 bucks

1137
03:57:44,469 --> 03:58:00,379
and skill points too. Salesman, runner, more illusion. Oh, wait a minute. My character sucks.

1138
03:58:00,940 --> 03:58:12,760
I'm too risky. All right. Let's go. I don't have anything on me. Yeah. Let's go get the money.

1139
03:58:13,639 --> 03:58:32,969
I'm going to have like six or 700 bucks. Illusionist hasn't worked once.

1140
03:58:32,969 --> 03:58:42,969
Sir, stop. Stand still, please. An illusion. What are you hiding?

1141
03:58:47,379 --> 03:59:02,979
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money. Excuse me. Do you have any money?

1142
03:59:03,540 --> 03:59:17,239
Hey, I got cash. Let me see it. $260. Nice. All right. Let's get the fuck out of here.

1143
03:59:17,799 --> 03:59:22,010
Let's get out of here and go. I haven't slept in like three days. All right. I'm going to get back

1144
03:59:22,010 --> 03:59:41,799
here and put my money in my safe and I'm going to sleep for like a day. This is a farmer game.

1145
03:59:42,840 --> 03:59:54,059
No one's tried to rob me. I feel like my security is not that high. I mean, at this point I have

1146
03:59:56,090 --> 04:00:20,540
that I don't like that number. Um, switch that. All right. Eddie in the works. I shouldn't be

1147
04:00:20,540 --> 04:00:35,110
more than 45 minutes for the new drug deals. Okay. Yeah. I did these already. It's waiting

1148
04:00:35,110 --> 04:00:50,309
for the ecstasy and then we're going to take a nap. Open up your mind. All right. Let's go get it

1149
04:00:50,309 --> 04:00:55,819
that far. I don't have any drugs on me. Just have $1 on me. Imagine getting arrested for having a

1150
04:00:55,819 --> 04:01:30,329
dollar. I got to pay him to under a rock. I'm not even close. Oh shit. I don't have anything.

1151
04:01:30,889 --> 04:02:10,579
I give him some ecstasy. The hell do I get over there? I guess this way. Where is it? Where the

1152
04:02:10,579 --> 04:02:18,780
hell is this thing? You don't have to hide it this well, man. I still have to be able to find it.

1153
04:02:20,979 --> 04:02:26,780
Open your mind. Yeah. Where? Stop. Leave me alone. Who? I can't even answer your texts.

1154
04:02:26,860 --> 04:03:12,579
It's got spray paint on the ground in the vent. Where's there a vent over here? Reception zero.

1155
04:03:12,579 --> 04:03:26,549
No perception. Like where's what? Where's a vent on? Open your mind of this vent. It's not even

1156
04:03:26,549 --> 04:03:33,020
under open your mind. Liar. Open your mind. Except it's the building next to open your mind. You're

1157
04:03:33,020 --> 04:03:45,610
fucking fired. Fire that guy. What is happening? My phone is broken. So I can't tell people spamming

1158
04:03:45,610 --> 04:04:01,700
me with messages. Why? You're E fired. E fired. Are these dry rub death threats? Are they?

1159
04:04:08,840 --> 04:04:15,610
I mean, it was, I was getting spammed. So let's see. What is this? What is this dry rub shit?

1160
04:04:15,610 --> 04:04:29,450
Are you the dry rub guy? Oh, I heard that you sell candy. Hey, they still got amp in stock.

1161
04:04:31,049 --> 04:04:39,159
Still got MDMA in stock. Hey, can we meet? I need ecstasy. Heard you sell candy.

1162
04:04:46,469 --> 04:04:56,709
Why would you ever come back? I must be the only drug dealer in the state because what is this new

1163
04:04:56,709 --> 04:05:05,340
new baking soda mix mix shit? Oh, fuck. Do I really got to hit up the baking soda guy for ecstasy?

1164
04:05:05,340 --> 04:05:08,760
I don't know if I want to do that. He's going to give me something that's.

1165
04:05:09,159 --> 04:05:17,239
Oh, all right. It's all ecstasy. So this is six grams. How much ecstasy did I even buy?

1166
04:05:17,239 --> 04:05:24,840
Oh, we can, we can make it. We can make it last. Don't worry. I got plenty of amphetamine.

1167
04:05:25,479 --> 04:05:31,059
All right. What's on here? 1.8 grams of new, new baking soda. Baking soda is shit.

1168
04:05:35,739 --> 04:05:44,979
All right. Get this out of here. Put it in this jar. Who cares? All right. Put, we'll do dry rub.

1169
04:05:44,979 --> 04:05:49,979
How much dry rub do I have? Can I mix dry rub and ecstasy? Is that going to kill somebody?

1170
04:05:51,020 --> 04:06:07,530
Oh, the guy that keeps everybody hates dry rub. Well, it's because it's just sugar and salt.

1171
04:06:07,530 --> 04:06:14,870
That's a really bad dry rub, by the way. That was, that's bad. That's not even good.

1172
04:06:15,670 --> 04:06:29,450
That's gross. Okay. Let's work this out. Uh, placement. I've got 20 grams of ecstasy

1173
04:06:31,260 --> 04:06:37,100
and I've got 10 grams of amphetamine. So, and by the way, I also have, uh, quite a few.

1174
04:06:37,819 --> 04:07:00,040
I have dry rubs. Put them over here. Work this out. Oh, look at this. Everybody wants them.

1175
04:07:00,680 --> 04:07:05,860
Don't worry. They'll, they'll, they'll have them. All right. For every week, we got to do,

1176
04:07:05,860 --> 04:07:10,819
we got to dilute this correctly. So for every, every five grams of ecstasy, there's going to be

1177
04:07:10,819 --> 04:07:17,780
one gram of dry rub. So we need two grams of dry rub here. I just got to get rid of this shit.

1178
04:07:17,780 --> 04:07:23,059
I got to get rid of it. That's two grams of dry rub. This is, I want five grams of, uh,

1179
04:07:24,020 --> 04:07:33,129
Oh, I got to crush it up. Okay. Five. Smash it up.

1180
04:07:47,049 --> 04:07:57,110
This item management. Sorry. I have a bad item management. I'm dealing with some shit here.

1181
04:07:57,110 --> 04:08:20,280
What do you mean? Stop, stop. Urgent, urgent. Stop, stop. What? What's the matter? This is

1182
04:08:20,280 --> 04:08:32,819
eight grams of unnamed mix. This is dry rub and ecstasy. And, okay. This is nine. Let's do,

1183
04:08:32,899 --> 04:08:47,989
oh, how much do I need? Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. They want this 12 grams.

1184
04:08:49,190 --> 04:09:05,579
Inted rock. What's here? This is nine and 11. Was that all the gross shit that was over here?

1185
04:09:05,579 --> 04:09:42,870
This one. Okay. Now let's mix this up. No, don't say dry rub. Um, no, um, ecstasy. Yeah. It's not

1186
04:09:42,870 --> 04:09:55,819
ecstasy. It's ecstasy. That's way, that way I can sell it. Okay. There's my, that's my ecstasy.

1187
04:09:56,379 --> 04:10:02,809
Now we got to package it up. Package it just as one grams. I'll figure it out later.

1188
04:10:03,610 --> 04:10:19,700
Need 13 of these. Okay. 16 grams of ecstasy. I got ecstasy. I got it. Here we go. And I'll figure

1189
04:10:19,700 --> 04:10:32,540
that out later. Uh, God, I hope mom don't come over. How about 20 grams of ecstasy? Emma, you're

1190
04:10:33,180 --> 04:10:40,420
an absolute legend. I need six grams urgent. I need ecstasy, ecstasy. What do you mean need

1191
04:10:40,420 --> 04:10:44,260
pill press? What are you talking about? I need a pill press. Where do I get a pill press? How

1192
04:10:44,260 --> 04:10:50,819
much money do I have? Okay. Put that, put my, all right. I'm going to take, I'm taking $666

1193
04:10:50,819 --> 04:11:03,780
at the grocery store and it's all in ones. I need a pill maker. People don't want powdered ecstasy.

1194
04:11:05,030 --> 04:11:19,079
Oh, all right. I got to go to the gas station, right? It's not illegal to have $666. It's just,

1195
04:11:19,079 --> 04:11:42,840
you, it just makes, it solidifies your act with the devil. Let's go here. Hi, I'm here or you

1196
04:11:42,840 --> 04:11:54,760
don't have this stuff. Um, who does have this? Wait, it's the, the drugs. Should I go to the

1197
04:11:54,760 --> 04:12:12,790
drug store? No. Wasn't there like a market or something that was right here? Where was it?

1198
04:12:12,790 --> 04:12:20,090
At the sewage treatment furniture store. No, not the furniture store. Drug store has it. Yeah,

1199
04:12:20,090 --> 04:12:24,489
but I can't get over there. I'm not allowed out. I, we want, why would they locked us in?

1200
04:12:26,120 --> 04:12:43,059
Wait, what do you mean they locked us in? All right. Well, there was like somebody that sold

1201
04:12:43,059 --> 04:12:58,280
stuff down somewhere in here, right? Some market or something. The old market. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

1202
04:12:58,280 --> 04:13:17,479
So I, I got to go that way. There we are. Okay. All right. Where's that lady?

1203
04:13:18,200 --> 04:13:48,860
And she right there. She's usually right here, right? All right. Other side, the other side of

1204
04:13:48,860 --> 04:13:56,729
the market. What's, where? Oh, you see, she's standing right here, right? Yeah. She's like right

1205
04:13:56,729 --> 04:14:08,139
here. Shit. Where is she? I'm just going to stand over here. Oh, I can't. Well, I have to just go

1206
04:14:08,139 --> 04:14:15,979
home. She's dead. No, she's not. Both of the checkpoint, both of the checkpoint was $666.

1207
04:14:16,780 --> 04:14:35,459
Why would I do that? Do it. Let me, let me deposit my money. I'm depositing $500.

1208
04:14:42,979 --> 04:14:49,500
All right. Do you want me to go through the checkpoint? It's not going to give me a,

1209
04:14:49,500 --> 04:15:09,579
I can't, how? I don't think I can even do that. Okay. So how do I let them, how do I go through it?

1210
04:15:10,379 --> 04:15:29,879
Police checkpoint. Stop. Police checkpoint. Hello? No, I can't do it yet. All right. Well, let me go.

1211
04:15:33,020 --> 04:15:45,829
Should I just wait it out till tomorrow? Pick up that can. Sorry.

1212
04:16:03,430 --> 04:16:34,950
It's not his house. All right. Staying still for 12 hours. Just go make Half-Life 3. I can't,

1213
04:16:34,950 --> 04:16:47,590
I don't have the, I don't have the tools for that. From plus two to minus two in a second.

1214
04:16:48,149 --> 04:17:04,709
Is that right? It happens. Sometimes that happens. DMC 2 waiting room. That's an interesting waiting

1215
04:17:04,709 --> 04:17:27,159
room. Somebody said, Jerma, I love this Half-Life 2 multiplayer dark RP. I said, oh my God, you're so

1216
04:17:27,159 --> 04:17:34,569
boring. What? Cause I'm sitting here? Cause I'm, I have, I have to do this. I have to sit here

1217
04:17:34,569 --> 04:17:49,879
during the fucking, what do you want? I gotta wait till tomorrow. Oh my God. You're boring me.

1218
04:17:49,879 --> 04:17:57,020
I have to sit here and do this until 7 a.m. tomorrow. Why don't just go get, it's worth me

1219
04:17:57,020 --> 04:18:03,059
paying a hundred dollars to just go get arrested. I'm going to bring one bag of dry rub outside

1220
04:18:03,059 --> 04:18:18,090
and just put my hands in the air and pay a hundred dollars for it to be tomorrow. I mean, is that,

1221
04:18:18,090 --> 04:18:21,530
is that's worth a hundred dollars to me? But no, it's not because then I'm going to get my

1222
04:18:23,049 --> 04:18:28,489
bars are going to be fucked up. DEA is going to come get you. That's what I mean. I don't want

1223
04:18:28,489 --> 04:18:32,170
to have to get arrested that many times because that bar will fill and then I'll be, I can't sell

1224
04:18:32,170 --> 04:18:53,479
my drugs anymore. It's now Wednesday. You just say like the one gunshots. When do I get a gun?

1225
04:18:54,200 --> 04:19:08,549
In fact, actually I'm kind of happy I don't have a gun. Respect on the way. What? T. Respect on sale

1226
04:19:08,549 --> 04:19:15,020
area is very low. Low respect, negative fixed sales. Make more sales, rent hideouts or mark

1227
04:19:15,020 --> 04:19:22,950
territory to regain respect. Who doesn't respect me? Old marketplace. Oh wow. We're losing respect

1228
04:19:23,590 --> 04:19:30,010
because I have to sell drugs, but I can't until I get the pill smasher thing.

1229
04:19:40,420 --> 04:19:45,700
Maybe it's because you're selling salt in a bag. Yeah. All right. I'm going to start selling real

1230
04:19:45,700 --> 04:19:55,860
stuff. All right. No more funny stuff. No more like jokey stuff. Get this out of here. No, we're

1231
04:19:55,860 --> 04:20:07,780
going to, okay. I'm going to make real drugs. I mean, I'm going to get rid of them. I'm still

1232
04:20:07,780 --> 04:20:21,000
going to sell them, but you know, all right, I'll get my respect back tomorrow. Sell insect shavings.

1233
04:20:30,040 --> 04:20:37,899
Stop. I have to do this. FDA approved. I think there's a bug in my hair in real life

1234
04:20:38,700 --> 04:20:46,600
and it's freaking me out. I'm about to pull it out. What is this? I think, I actually think this is,

1235
04:20:46,600 --> 04:20:53,899
this is a piece of small chocolate from the Reese's that I ate earlier. Oh, that's just gross.

1236
04:20:54,620 --> 04:21:04,010
I have to, now I have to clean my head. I think it's an insect head. I think it's an

1237
04:21:04,010 --> 04:21:12,040
insect leg. Maybe. Yeah. All right. One in the chat. If you say Reese's pieces, two in the chat.

1238
04:21:12,040 --> 04:21:35,319
If you say Reese's pieces, like an idiot, pretty split. Okay. I have to do this. I gotta go. I gotta

1239
04:21:35,319 --> 04:21:41,780
go. Nobody likes me. I'm about to get run out of town. Okay. We need respect. A lot of it.

1240
04:21:41,780 --> 04:21:46,420
How do I get respect? How do you get respect? How do I get respect? It's sell stuff people want.

1241
04:21:46,420 --> 04:21:50,899
All right. I'm going to get you the cleanest shit ever. All right. You still do an MDMA.

1242
04:21:52,260 --> 04:22:00,040
I'm not, but you are. Okay. Who wants candy? No, I need the pill crusher. Ecstasy. I need the pill

1243
04:22:00,040 --> 04:22:04,760
thing. No, do I actually need that? Can I just bring her, can I just bring it to her and she can

1244
04:22:04,760 --> 04:22:18,700
do it? Yes, I do. Respect me. Just give it to them. It comes in pills, but it doesn't matter.

1245
04:22:18,700 --> 04:22:21,500
Just get the pill thing. Well, I just tried to, but I have to wait till tomorrow.

1246
04:22:22,379 --> 04:22:32,010
Nobody else wants anything else besides ecstasy. MDMA, candy. All right. Let's just, I gotta get

1247
04:22:32,010 --> 04:22:36,579
my respect up. Don't bring him dry rub. Bring him real stuff. I just need, where's amphetamine?

1248
04:22:37,139 --> 04:22:41,049
Okay. Put this amphetamine into a fucking jar. Where's the amphetamine? Here's the real one.

1249
04:22:42,440 --> 04:22:53,000
Package. He just wants two. All right. This is the real stuff. This is what he wants. Okay. James,

1250
04:22:53,000 --> 04:23:09,100
two grams of the real stuff. You got it. Put this money away. Just give them the real ecstasy.

1251
04:23:09,100 --> 04:23:23,370
You have so much ecstasy in pills. I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna give him the ecstasy.

1252
04:23:23,370 --> 04:23:31,559
What, what did I, where, where's the, uh, where is it? All right. Ecstasy. Gonna crush up the,

1253
04:23:31,559 --> 04:23:36,360
we gotta just give him, just give him the ecstasy. Wait, if, wait, wait, it already was pills.

1254
04:23:38,180 --> 04:23:43,700
It already is pills. I broke it. It already is pills. It's already pills. I think, you guys,

1255
04:23:43,700 --> 04:23:52,149
somebody had to get a pill crusher. What? Six. Oh my God. Six. Yes. Urgent. Urgent. Six grams.

1256
04:23:52,149 --> 04:24:01,049
Two. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. And then you want 20. You're gonna have to wait.

1257
04:24:01,049 --> 04:24:08,389
I'm ready. Let's go. I've got, I got enough. Wait, I have to, do I have to wait? Hold on.

1258
04:24:09,350 --> 04:24:14,840
I need to put it in the jar and take it out of the jar. Here we go. Which one of these is empty?

1259
04:24:14,840 --> 04:24:21,270
There's sugar in this one. Dump it. No, just deselect it. Um, where's an empty jar? This is

1260
04:24:21,270 --> 04:24:28,899
one empty? There's nothing in there. Okay. Put it in the ecstasy. All right. All right. All right.

1261
04:24:29,780 --> 04:24:36,579
Okay. Put this in here. Lab mode. No. Lab. Labo. Nintendo lab mode. Nintendo make drugs mode.

04:24:37,219 --> 04:24:50,950
Okay. Get it in there. Add it. Package it. Take it out. All in ones. Thank you. Put this in here.

1263
04:24:52,969 --> 04:25:04,920
All in ones. Take it out. Let's go. I'm out. Yeah, I have too much amphetamine in my bag. No,

1264
04:25:04,920 --> 04:25:13,020
I have enough. Let's go. All right. We got a lot of customers. We got everybody. We're just gonna

1265
04:25:13,020 --> 04:25:17,239
run. If the cops try to catch me, I'm just gonna run. I don't care. I have super running.

1266
04:25:21,909 --> 04:25:41,559
Number one. We're gonna go right first. Wendy and Chop. Okay. Hey Chop. How you doing? I have

1267
04:25:41,559 --> 04:25:49,879
drugs. Um, I have ecstasy for you. And remember, we're under new management now. So, um, if you

1268
04:25:49,879 --> 04:25:55,639
could tell everybody, maybe give us a Yelp review. Maybe give us a, uh, thank you. I appreciate you

1269
04:25:55,639 --> 04:26:02,090
and appreciate your business. Thank you. Oh, at least even four stars helped. Bye Chop.

1270
04:26:02,090 --> 04:26:17,930
Chop. Hi Wendy. Hey, yeah, you want ecstasy. Sure thing. I got it for you. There you go. Okay,

1271
04:26:17,930 --> 04:26:21,370
Wendy, you're gonna get a survey emailed to you. Um, if you could take that survey.

1272
04:26:22,809 --> 04:26:27,850
Fives across the board will help. Um, make sure you do it. If you don't, it's all right, but do it.

1273
04:26:27,850 --> 04:26:33,370
All right. Okay. Thank you. Have a great day. I laugh for both of us, sir. Uh, but we're both

1274
04:26:33,370 --> 04:26:39,450
going this way. I both have to go the same way. Fuck. No, I made a joke. No, no, no, no. It took

1275
04:26:39,450 --> 04:26:55,180
too long. Get in your house. That's not my house. Where's my house? Throw it. Throw it back.

1276
04:27:08,870 --> 04:27:19,450
Fuck. Standing right. I don't have anything. I don't have anything. I don't have anything.

1277
04:27:19,450 --> 04:27:32,870
Okay. I think we're good. Throw the bag of drugs. Go hide in the corner next to all the drugs on

1278
04:27:32,870 --> 04:27:38,409
the table, which is way more than what was in the fucking bag. Oh my God. My brain is so,

1279
04:27:38,409 --> 04:27:52,420
so small. Okay. We good. What the, what do I have? Ecstasy. Put it away. Let's go back to do this.

1280
04:27:52,420 --> 04:27:57,620
Two grams. I need another. I need the real stuff. The fake stuff is already in there. Okay. Cash.

1281
04:27:57,620 --> 04:28:18,889
Store it. Go back out. Donald, I'm coming for you. What? No, no, no, no. This is not. That's

1282
04:28:18,889 --> 04:28:24,889
ecstasy. That's the real one. That's not the fake one. You have a ton of dry rub on you. I don't.

1283
04:28:24,889 --> 04:28:29,379
What are you talking about? Oh shit. They're right there.

1284
04:28:33,110 --> 04:28:49,129
They're in every corner. No, I'm not going to go home because I have the, it's 30 minutes or it's

1285
04:28:49,129 --> 04:29:03,850
free. I got to make it to Donald. Where's Donald? Donald. What do you need? Ecstasy. Six. You want

1286
04:29:03,850 --> 04:29:07,530
a lot. Here you go. Six. This is going to be a lot of money. There you are. Have a nice day. Thank

1287
04:29:07,530 --> 04:29:39,399
you. Thanks for the 80 bucks. Have a nice night. Now we got to go over this way. Get some sleep.

1288
04:29:39,399 --> 04:29:47,620
What do you want? Two ecstasy? Got you. Thank you. Give me that respect. Appreciate it.

1289
04:29:48,180 --> 04:29:53,979
And that's the real stuff, by the way. That stuff's real. Just in case you didn't know,

1290
04:29:53,979 --> 04:29:58,139
it's not, I'm not, it's not like a just stupid stream joke. That's real ecstasy.

1291
04:29:58,139 --> 04:30:50,920
Just want to make sure you know that. What are the ATM? Why? Hey James. Two grams of amphetamine. Hey,

1292
04:30:50,920 --> 04:31:01,190
that's mid strong. Oh, here. Have a nice day. Goodbye. More respect, please. There we go. Now

1293
04:31:01,190 --> 04:31:06,309
I'm doing a little bit. No, it's not so bad. Okay. I've got cat. I still have ecstasy on me.

1294
04:31:06,309 --> 04:31:35,860
Fuck. Have your pockets. Officer, don't worry. What do you got in your hand? Just dry rub.

1295
04:31:35,860 --> 04:31:41,860
Look, see. What's in the other hand? It's dry. No, that's amphetamine. I'm going to jail.

1296
04:31:42,579 --> 04:31:59,860
Oh my God. Throw the backpack? No, just put it in the backpack so I can just, I can throw the

1297
04:31:59,860 --> 04:32:52,860
backpack. Back to the house, which is over there. What? All right. Red car. Red car. Red car. It's

1298
04:32:52,860 --> 04:33:06,310
by the red car. Am I in jail? Oh no, I thought this was a prison cell. It's in my house. Red car.

1299
04:33:06,310 --> 04:33:19,189
All right. Red car. Any more deals? 20 grams of ecstasy. I don't have that. And I never will.

1300
04:33:19,270 --> 04:34:05,540
I gotta get it before somebody finds it. Red car. What's that red car? All right. What's in here?

1301
04:34:05,540 --> 04:34:12,729
Drugs saved. Yep. We're good. Store them. And then I need to come up with, I need to get 20 more.

1302
04:34:13,290 --> 04:34:17,450
Oh, I want, I want to get the pill thing that you guys are telling me to get.

1303
04:34:24,950 --> 04:34:30,650
20 grams of ecstasy. I did, I traded everything. All right. We got, how much money do I have?

1304
04:34:31,209 --> 04:34:46,419
410 bucks. One package of dry rub. Blood echoes recovered. Yep. I have a lot of actual amphetamine,

1305
04:34:46,500 --> 04:34:53,509
just okay. Don't sell this to anybody until I have enough respect. And get the dry rub out of here

1306
04:34:53,509 --> 04:34:57,270
too. Store this, get this, get rid of this. Just keep it in the closet forever until people like

1307
04:34:57,270 --> 04:35:08,229
you again. So now I need to come up with, I need to get one of those shipment of ecstasy.

1308
04:35:08,950 --> 04:35:20,150
I need money to give you money too. How much do I owe you? 360 bucks. Fuck off.

1309
04:35:22,360 --> 04:35:48,040
All right. I just have money on me. Let's go. Yo, house flipper got wild. All right. I'll be

1310
04:35:48,040 --> 04:35:51,959
honest with you. Okay. Let's give you the real opinion. It's been about four and a half hours.

1311
04:35:53,400 --> 04:36:15,159
It's pretty fun. It's pretty, it's pretty good. It's good. It's kind of fun. Money. Now I get to

1312
04:36:15,159 --> 04:36:24,709
buy more ecstasy. Local streamer loves selling crack to kids. None of these people here are kids.

1313
04:36:25,270 --> 04:36:32,200
These are all, all of them have been adults and I'm virtually selling drugs to virtual adults.

1314
04:36:32,200 --> 04:37:02,220
So sorry. You have, have it wrong actually. He adults give me as much ecstasy as I can possibly

1315
04:37:02,220 --> 04:37:14,439
buy from you. Sorry. Fake ecstasy. 50. Give me 50 of them. 50 grams. Yep. This is virtually illegal.

1316
04:37:18,200 --> 04:37:22,279
You need 20. I'm coming. I'll give it to you. Can I get this guy to come back?

1317
04:37:23,000 --> 04:37:44,549
If I promise him an hour and 15 minutes, that was just a bugleberry.

1318
04:37:52,330 --> 04:38:00,180
Okay. B11 and B12. Those are important vitamins. Whatever that means. All right. We'll just go to

1319
04:38:00,180 --> 04:38:10,310
the, I'm going to go to that old market, bring some money. I'm going to bring any, well, I say

1320
04:38:10,310 --> 04:38:21,669
it takes from my bank account, doesn't it? Take my laptop first. Omega lull. But I do have that.

1321
04:38:23,419 --> 04:38:36,840
Okay. I do have that. What? What's going on? Omega lull, omega lull, omega lull place. What?

1322
04:38:36,840 --> 04:38:57,349
What's going on? Tell the shit stain story. Wait, what? What happened? Wait, what did, what did,

1323
04:38:57,349 --> 04:39:10,790
what did Kim say something? What did she say? Tell the shit stain story. Kim is asking if you want

1324
04:39:10,790 --> 04:39:23,939
McChickens. Oh my God. Are you kidding me? If you're still listening, Kim. Honey. Yeah. Oh yeah.

1325
04:39:25,099 --> 04:39:33,240
You know exactly what I like. What happened? Yeah. Okay. You ready? Yeah. Oh, the stream is

1326
04:39:33,240 --> 04:39:40,060
going to have to end. Oh no. No, it won't. Maybe it will. We'll see how long it takes. All right.

1327
04:39:41,529 --> 04:40:00,650
You already got them? Are you here? Are you here right now? Wait a minute. I hear, hold on a second.

1328
04:40:00,650 --> 04:40:08,169
I hear rustling of bags and I hear a person. I hear a person over here. Wait a minute. Oh my God.

1329
04:40:08,169 --> 04:40:13,770
I just got a legit McChicken delivery service. Holy shit. This is the best day of my whole life.

1330
04:40:15,299 --> 04:40:20,979
Oh my God. That's a lot of food in there. I'll be right back everybody. Give me five seconds.

1331
04:40:21,540 --> 04:40:35,689
Okay. We're going to go on a quick McChicken break. I'm going to eat these McChickens and

1332
04:40:35,689 --> 04:40:40,330
then I'm going to be back in like five minutes. I'm dying dead serious. I'll be back in like three

1333
04:40:40,330 --> 04:40:59,180
or four minutes. I'm, I'm very serious. Wait, hold on. Put it up. I'll prove it. I, this is

1334
04:40:59,180 --> 04:41:03,340
fucking ridiculous. Unbelievable. I'm so happy. Yeah. I'll prove it. I'll, I'll eat a couple of

1335
04:41:03,340 --> 04:41:09,900
fucking classic McDonald's french fries. And you can tell that that crunch was more like a chew

1336
04:41:09,900 --> 04:41:22,700
through. Um, that was not crunchy at all. All right. Okay everybody. Don't ever hit the fucking

1337
04:41:22,700 --> 04:41:34,840
jackpot. See you guys in an hour. I'll see you in an hour. I'll be back in five minutes. I promise.

1338
04:41:34,840 --> 04:41:43,479
Time it. Yeah. I know. Oh, I cracked. Whatever. This is a crack stream. So it's fine. I'll be right back.

1339
04:50:03,380 --> 04:50:12,680
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. You're a little late. It's all right. It's all right.

1340
04:50:12,680 --> 04:50:17,080
It was worth it. It was worth. I was getting hungry. You know, when you, you know, when you're

1341
04:50:17,080 --> 04:50:22,040
really just starting to get fucking hungry, I was thinking, all right, I'd probably stream for like

1342
04:50:22,040 --> 04:50:26,599
another hour or two. See what, maybe I'll see how it goes. Maybe another hour or so. And then what

1343
04:50:26,599 --> 04:50:31,720
am I going to, I got to do something for food. I'm going to make some food downstairs because

1344
04:50:31,720 --> 04:50:37,459
obviously there's, you can't, we can't really go very many places and somebody walks in like,

1345
04:50:37,779 --> 04:50:45,380
like a magic trick. Somebody walks in the door with a bag of everything that you love.

1346
04:50:46,180 --> 04:50:52,740
It's like, what the fuck? That was insane. Oh, and it had to be good old fashioned classic

1347
04:50:52,740 --> 04:50:59,110
McDonald's. The best, the best restaurant in America without a doubt. I love McDonald's.

1348
04:50:59,110 --> 04:51:09,369
It's the best. All right, let's go. Wrong. I don't care. You can think I'm wrong. That's fine.

1349
04:51:14,900 --> 04:51:23,529
You're a McDonald's shill. Yeah, sure. Call me that. That's fine. That's the,

1350
04:51:23,529 --> 04:51:28,569
you can't beat a McChicken. I don't care. The Big Mac is one of the most classic

1351
04:51:28,569 --> 04:51:33,849
fast food staples. You can't be beaten. Sure. But what about the fucking Whopper?

1352
04:51:33,849 --> 04:51:43,159
Get that shit out of here. No, they're, they're, they're single from Wendy's. Now get it out of

1353
04:51:43,159 --> 04:52:03,779
here. Delete it. Oh, my package is, oh shit. Wait, how long is it? All right, let's go. I have a

1354
04:52:03,779 --> 04:52:11,779
package. I'm slowing down. Okay, I have to, I ate a lot of food and now I'm slowing down. Okay.

1355
04:52:12,580 --> 04:52:27,189
I have to, we're going this way. The McMagician, the McChicken Magician. He's, I'm slow. I have

1356
04:52:27,189 --> 04:52:30,869
to eat a lot of, I have to eat like three McChickens in a Big Mac. You got to slow down. That's what

1357
04:52:30,869 --> 04:52:40,069
happens. And I'm slowing down, but I'm good. Okay. What was I doing? Oh yeah, right. Ronald,

1358
04:52:40,470 --> 04:52:46,569
right. Ronald McDonald. I love that guy. No, Donald, Donald Rick Model. All right, Donald

1359
04:52:46,569 --> 04:53:07,619
McDonald. Let's go. Excuse me. Wait, can I give you something? No. The chicken was laced. You want,

1360
04:53:07,619 --> 04:53:15,319
what do you want? What does this guy want? I don't know. Where's that package? Don't look over here.

1361
04:53:15,319 --> 04:53:22,099
Okay, there's a lot. There's 50 grams in here. What does that guy want? He wants like five.

1362
04:53:22,659 --> 04:53:40,659
Fuck off. For now. This person wants 20. Here you go. How's it going? Here. I got for you

1363
04:53:41,779 --> 04:53:51,459
huh? No, break it up. I, no, I don't want to, I wanted five tens. Why'd you give me a 50? 50.

1364
04:53:51,459 --> 04:54:12,099
Oh, you gave me a 50. Only want to work in fives. Did I check my upgrade points last? It was pretty

1365
04:54:12,099 --> 04:54:16,779
long ago. I'm actually, you know, I'm actually surprised that this many people stayed on the

1366
04:54:16,779 --> 04:54:25,220
stream. I was going for like 10 minutes more than that. Oh, you guys stayed. Thanks. Hopefully you're

1367
04:54:25,220 --> 04:54:35,990
having fun. All right. Let's get it out on the table. It's a huge bag. Can I anything even hold

1368
04:54:35,990 --> 04:54:46,520
50? What's in there? Marijuana. What's in there? Sugar. Okay. It's time just to make like a sugar

1369
04:54:46,520 --> 04:54:53,540
syrup. What's in there? Dry rub. Put it in there. Okay. There's nothing, nothing. Salt. Put it in

1370
04:54:53,540 --> 04:55:15,209
there. Okay. Cool. Now mix it. I'm just consolidating. Sugar. Okay. Now I need to do

1371
04:55:16,840 --> 04:55:24,700
is nothing in there. Please put 20 in there. An ecstasy. So we get blue. In fact, I mean is

1372
04:55:24,700 --> 04:55:32,119
pink. What's in there? Nothing. Also put this in here. 10. It's blue. It's ecstasy. Pure

1373
04:55:32,919 --> 04:55:38,119
ecstasy. Nothing in there either. You know what to do. I don't have to be the one to tell you. You

1374
04:55:38,119 --> 04:55:47,770
know what to do. Nothing. Put it in. Blue is ecstasy. There we go. And then this is the,

1375
04:55:48,409 --> 04:56:19,479
can I just like slide this off the table on the rug? Won't pass meat inspection. What does it say?

1376
04:56:20,119 --> 04:56:28,090
Yeah. I'll take it in ones. Somebody's trying to talk to me. All right. I'll take it in ones

1377
04:56:28,090 --> 04:56:31,369
and then throw the rest of this shit away. Just dump this. I don't even want it. Goodbye. Throw it

1378
04:56:31,369 --> 04:56:39,500
to the dump. It's, it's a one gram of sugar. Just put it in the trash. Okay. So now I have,

1379
04:56:39,500 --> 04:56:49,099
let's do, let's get the ecstasy out in small doses. I want it. Blue 10s. That's 20. And then

1380
04:56:49,099 --> 04:57:02,950
I want the rest in ones and ones. It's too many. I can remove it then. Okay. How much is in here?

1381
04:57:02,950 --> 04:57:15,610
10 grams. I want it in ones. Thank you. I want it in ones. I want it in ones and I want it in

1383
04:57:31,380 --> 04:57:35,060

1384
04:57:35,060 --> 04:57:50,569
stream if I can. All right. Let's go. And two grams of marijuana, two grams. I need four grams

04:58:23,080 --> 04:58:29,049
Yep. Get it out of your system when you have a chance. Get it out now. Okay. How much do I have?

04:58:29,049 --> 04:58:41,180
A lot. New sugar mix. I don't need this much ecstasy. I need 20, I need fucking like

04:58:55,450 --> 04:59:03,080
groat clown. Thank you both of you for your insane sub drops and community subs from non-descript.

1399
05:00:37,110 --> 05:00:47,220
for the five subs. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Those mick chickens were mick edibles. I don't know

1400
05:00:47,220 --> 05:00:56,060
the name. They were not. They were very good though. It was perfect. I know people say this shit

1401
05:00:56,060 --> 05:01:03,990
and they pretend to mean it, but I really do mean this. I could probably eat a two mick chickens for

1402
05:01:03,990 --> 05:01:09,270
lunch every single day of the rest of my life. I'm serious. I'm just telling you the truth.

1403
05:01:09,270 --> 05:01:25,659
You want to, um, I don't have any extra. Nevermind. Fuck off. Wait, it's the lady. Functional.

1404
05:01:25,659 --> 05:01:31,029
It doesn't have anything. It's a short lifespan. I'm just saying like I could.

1405
05:01:32,419 --> 05:01:37,139
What the mick chickens aren't even that, what do you mean lifespan? It's one little chicken

1406
05:01:37,139 --> 05:01:42,889
patty with like a little bit of mayo and lettuce on it. It's not like a big deal.

1407
05:01:43,610 --> 05:01:49,979
Come here. Here you go. You want the marijuana? You got the marijuana.

1408
05:01:52,139 --> 05:01:57,990
What? Oh, that's too much. Sorry about, sorry about almost giving you double.

1409
05:01:58,630 --> 05:02:09,259
Why didn't you take it? How are we doing? What does this guy want? What's this guy want?

1410
05:02:10,139 --> 05:02:13,580
Two grams of marijuana. Oh, I have that. I can give it to you. Hey,

from Royal Dawi. Thanks for the fucking ridiculous amounts of money guys. That's a lot of money.

1419
05:03:30,680 --> 05:03:46,700
Thanks a lot. Rack stream. Rack stream. How we doing? You want? I got weed. You got? You want

1420
05:03:46,700 --> 05:03:53,930
weed? I got it. Two grams of ecstasy. I got it. See you in a minute. We're gonna do a very quick

1421
05:03:53,930 --> 05:04:06,200
delivery here. And I'm gonna take a little bit more. I'm gonna take like, wait, do I not have

1422
05:04:06,200 --> 05:04:17,880
any more ecstasy? Am I out of ecstasy already? Oh no. What the fuck am I doing? I'm gonna take

1423
05:04:17,880 --> 05:04:29,860
like, I'm gonna take like eight with me because I want to give free samples. He doesn't enjoy

1424
05:04:29,860 --> 05:04:44,229
streaming. All right. Eddie. Uh, do I have money for you? 350 bucks. I think I have to take a

1425
05:04:44,229 --> 05:04:53,159
withdrawal. No, I, what are you talking about? All right. I got marijuana. I got ecstasy. I got cash.

1426
05:04:53,159 --> 05:05:04,840
I'm gonna pay. I'm gonna pay Eddie. Let's go. Is he getting burned out? What are you guys talking

1427
05:05:04,840 --> 05:05:13,099
about? He hates it when people sub. What? He hates him. Hate who? What are you referring to?

1428
05:05:13,099 --> 05:05:19,560
What are you describing? He must be burned out. If I was burnt out right now, guys,

1429
05:05:19,560 --> 05:05:25,779
when the McChicken delivery came to the door, I would have left. I would have been like,

1430
05:05:25,779 --> 05:05:35,930
I'm fucking out of here. I got more drugs to sell. Uh, you want two grams of ecstasy. I'll give it

1431
05:05:35,930 --> 05:05:45,639
to you. And then who has the marijuana? You do. Is there an ATM right here? No, there's not.

1432
05:05:46,599 --> 05:06:04,840
Five more subs on the sub train. This one's from Ratamibo. Thank you Ratamibo for the five subs.

1433
05:06:04,840 --> 05:06:16,099
That's another five. Fucking crazy. Thank you so much. Lizard95, not to be outdone,

1434
05:06:17,060 --> 05:06:29,500
decides to get $50 right now. 5,000 bits. And they say,

1435
05:06:29,500 --> 05:06:32,540
Jerma finally gets a new sponsor and it's McDonald's. That hasn't happened. That's not

1436
05:06:32,540 --> 05:06:39,479
real. Sounds like you need these bits more than me. What? That didn't happen. It didn't happen.

1437
05:06:39,479 --> 05:06:42,680
But I will just tell you that I don't need to get paid any money just to tell you

1438
05:06:43,479 --> 05:06:51,930
that McDonald's is my favorite fast food restaurant out of the big three. Out of the big three. How?

1439
05:06:51,930 --> 05:06:55,939
What was that? He just stabbed me with a voodoo doll. What the fuck?

1440
05:06:57,669 --> 05:07:10,939
All right. So Burger King's good. I like it. I need to make some. I need to get, uh,

1441
05:07:10,939 --> 05:07:15,580
go take money out of the ATM. But thank you Lizard95 for the huge amount of money. That's

1442
05:07:15,580 --> 05:07:22,810
$50 you just gave. You just gave me. You just gave it to me. Thank you. I'll take it. Thank you.

1443
05:07:23,369 --> 05:07:29,700
All right. I need the ATM. There's only one ATM I can even use and it's by the furniture shop.

1444
05:07:29,700 --> 05:07:36,020
Dumb. The big three, McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King. The big three fast food restaurants.

1445
05:07:36,020 --> 05:07:52,869
What do you think I was talking about? KFC? KFC doesn't do hamburgers. I'm talking about like

1446
05:07:52,869 --> 05:08:02,220
the three, like the three big three hamburger restaurants. Uh, oh, okay. No, no, five guys.

1447
05:08:02,220 --> 05:08:08,119
There's all this. We already went over the tier system. Five guys does not have like

1448
05:08:08,119 --> 05:08:15,290
28,000 restaurants. The big three, the big ones, the big ones, the ones that are everywhere and

1449
05:08:15,290 --> 05:08:25,529
every city and every town one mile apart from each other. Burger King, Wendy's, McDonald's.

1450
05:08:25,529 --> 05:08:32,259
Another five subs came in from Westeel. Thank you. Thank you Westeel for the five community subs.

1451
05:08:32,259 --> 05:08:44,840
Take out 250. Five one guys. No, five guys is on a different level. It's like on a different tier.

1452
05:08:44,840 --> 05:08:52,659
Of course, obviously five guys is better than McDonald's, but it's on a different playing field.

1453
05:08:52,659 --> 05:08:57,139
It's more, it's like, it's not even in the same, it's not the same thing. They're not the same

1454
05:08:57,139 --> 05:09:05,049
restaurants. It's, it's a better restaurant, but it's not in the same tier of restaurants.

1455
05:09:05,049 --> 05:09:14,900
It's more, yeah, it's it, but that you can't compare, you can't compare like Shake Shack to

1456
05:09:14,900 --> 05:09:19,819
McDonald's. That doesn't make any sense. Just hold on while I give this guy some free ecstasy

1457
05:09:19,819 --> 05:09:38,950
because Shake Shack, because Shake Shack sucks. I say that five times fast. Shake Shack sucks.

1458
05:09:38,950 --> 05:09:46,180
Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack, Shake Shack sucks. I gotta take my headphones off. Shake Shack sucks.

1459
05:09:46,180 --> 05:09:57,130
Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Hold on, I'll get it. I feel like close my

1460
05:09:57,130 --> 05:10:04,020
eyes and close my ears and shit. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack

1461
05:10:04,020 --> 05:10:11,639
sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack. Shake, I have to, this is what I have, this is what I have to do

1462
05:10:11,639 --> 05:10:24,569
to get this to work. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. Shake

1463
05:10:24,569 --> 05:10:40,979
Shack sucks. Shake Shack sucks. I got it, didn't I? I got it, right? Um, no, no, no, no. I, I, I love

1464
05:10:40,979 --> 05:10:45,860
Shake Shack. I love Shake Shack. I actually really do. I think it's fantastic. Shake Shack's great.

1465
05:10:45,939 --> 05:10:52,580
Shake Shack slaps? Shake Shack slaps, right? Does that work? Does that work for you guys? Shake

1466
05:10:52,580 --> 05:10:59,049
Shack slaps. Shake Shack slaps. Shake Shack's great. I love, I actually really like Shake Shack a lot.

1467
05:10:59,049 --> 05:11:04,439
Uh, so don't, I'm just trying to tell you that was a hard thing to do. Hard thing to say.

1468
05:11:04,439 --> 05:11:10,200
I, I really like it. I love Shake Shack. It's like, I, it's probably, I, it's probably the top five of

1469
05:11:10,200 --> 05:11:15,189
fucking medium-sized. Not super-sized. Like McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and KFC.

1470
05:11:15,189 --> 05:11:37,689
KFC's just fried chicken. What are you, insane? All right. Whoa! What? Oh no. Wait. Throw the

1471
05:11:37,689 --> 05:12:03,979
fucking bag. I'm right here. Oh, it's because I dipped around the corner. Uh, 100 bucks. Where's,

1472
05:12:03,979 --> 05:12:10,470
where, where the, where was that? Where the, I need to know where that was. There was like

1473
05:12:10,470 --> 05:12:22,139
$400 in that bag. Where was that? Who knows? Somebody has to. Where was I? I don't, I don't

1474
05:12:22,139 --> 05:12:33,020
remember. He hates bits. Oh shit. 6,900 bits came in. $69. Where did it go? Right behind the house?

1475
05:12:35,290 --> 05:12:47,700
So, so, Solaris gave $69. That's fucking crazy. Wait, it was like right here, right? Yes. There's

1476
05:12:47,700 --> 05:13:07,380
$420 in there. Good. Okay. Hold on. Let me, come on, Eddie. Here, take some free stuff. Hold on. One

1477
05:13:07,380 --> 05:13:23,659
second. Let me pay Eddie. Here we go. Good. All right. I'm in the clear now. Let me get the hell

1478
05:13:23,659 --> 05:13:29,290
back to the house. I got a bunch of new clients probably. But Solaris, thanks for the fucking

1479
05:13:29,290 --> 05:13:42,169
$69. I say, hey, Jerma, happy holidays. Happy holidays to you too. Holidays? What? Happy

1480
05:13:42,169 --> 05:14:00,840
holidays? Happy holidays to you. Have a good 420. Wait, what? What's today? Today is 419. I, I, wait,

1481
05:14:00,840 --> 05:14:10,020
I didn't play this game on the right day. It's 419. Oh shit. I didn't even do that on purpose.

1482
05:14:10,659 --> 05:14:20,090
If it was on purpose, I would have done it today, tomorrow. Yeah, well, happy, happy, have a, if you

1483
05:14:20,090 --> 05:14:24,490
smoke weed, it's recreationally legal and medically legal in the state that you're currently in and

1484
05:14:24,490 --> 05:14:28,250
the jurisdiction you're in. By all means, if you enjoy it, do it responsibly and do it privately

1485
05:14:28,250 --> 05:14:31,689
and do it in a place where you're legally allowed to do it and hope you like it. Take care of yourself

1486
05:14:31,689 --> 05:14:41,110
if it's legal where you are. Have fun. Anyways, I spent, I just want to say thank you for being

1487
05:14:41,110 --> 05:14:46,569
the best antidepressant I've ever had. I spent most of my adult life as an isolated shut-in.

1488
05:14:46,569 --> 05:14:50,169
Seeing everyone else going insane under quarantine is kind of fucking hilarious.

1489
05:14:51,189 --> 05:14:55,750
Like they just can't watch Twitch forehead. I live in Michigan and no one here is taking it seriously,

1490
05:14:55,750 --> 05:15:00,950
so I guess we'll, we'll just die. No joke. After I bought these bits, it left me with $69 in my

1491
05:15:00,950 --> 05:15:22,470
account. Nice. I'll hope I get away from the train to go by. Will you? Okay. First of all,

1492
05:15:22,470 --> 05:15:30,540
thanks for the $69. I mean, yeah, everyone's gonna say nice, nice, right? But it's the whole

1493
05:15:30,540 --> 05:15:35,580
lockdown thing and the quarantine thing. It's a, it's hard for people. It really is because

1494
05:15:36,759 --> 05:15:43,369
at least for, I mean, I'm talking to just be personally, I like to go do things. I like to

1495
05:15:43,369 --> 05:15:49,610
go places. And for people that are very, very, their normal lives are to just be out of their

1496
05:15:49,610 --> 05:15:56,569
houses. It is a pretty huge major change in their lives. So, I mean, it's difficult just to say,

1497
05:15:56,569 --> 05:16:02,419
well, just continue to stay home. You can do it. It's like, we are describing things that people

1498
05:16:02,419 --> 05:16:06,340
have never really ever had to do before. And some people really, really like to be out of their

1499
05:16:06,340 --> 05:16:13,020
houses. So it is hard. It's tough for pretty much everybody, but it's necessary. That's the thing.

1500
05:16:13,020 --> 05:16:24,540
That's the next part of that. Normally it's shuttered and even I'm going crazy. I think it's

1501
05:16:24,540 --> 05:16:31,419
not just, it's not about going crazy in quotes. I think where I get kind of annoyed and sad and

1502
05:16:31,419 --> 05:16:37,340
irritated by this whole thing is just knowing that there's a bunch of people that are just,

1503
05:16:37,340 --> 05:16:42,500
they can't go to work and they can't do anything. And it's like, you're almost in like this, this

1504
05:16:42,500 --> 05:16:47,139
state of complete limbo. And I feel so terrible for those people that have to go through this

1505
05:16:47,139 --> 05:16:54,650
shit. Essential workers that have to be at their job every day. They have to be there because they

1506
05:16:54,650 --> 05:17:02,340
know how important what they're doing is. It's tricky all around. I really hope we get over this.

1507
05:17:02,340 --> 05:17:07,380
I really hope it is something that can realistically in the next few months, hopefully

1508
05:17:07,380 --> 05:17:15,299
we can seriously just try to get back to somewhere where we can even leave our houses without just

1509
05:17:15,299 --> 05:17:20,819
being in our cars or being able to get out of your car and go somewhere and do something.

1510
05:17:21,700 --> 05:17:29,380
Go to work without a problem. But people aren't used to this shit. We've never had to do this

1511
05:17:29,380 --> 05:17:34,810
before. This is something we've never had to do before ever. And it's just like, hey, you got to

1512
05:17:34,810 --> 05:17:38,889
do it now. And it's like, oh, fuck. Okay. Well, we got to do that now. And people are doing it.

1513
05:17:39,450 --> 05:17:44,889
There are, yeah, there are some cases obviously in a lot of, you've seen the pictures. I've seen them

1514
05:17:44,889 --> 05:17:50,169
too of like, oh, who cares? We're at stay at home orders, but let's just go to the fucking beach.

1515
05:17:50,169 --> 05:18:01,020
Right. And it's just like, okay, what the fuck are you doing? Right. People going out to buy

1516
05:18:01,020 --> 05:18:10,380
shoe cakes. Hold on a second there. Wait a minute. Already actively assuming that I,

1517
05:18:10,939 --> 05:18:22,439
well, you don't understand. That was made by my mother. My mother made that and shipped it to me.

1518
05:18:23,610 --> 05:18:27,130
That's where that came from. What a great mother this guy's got, by the way.

1519
05:18:31,099 --> 05:18:41,849
Okay. Mom, I need a shoe. Oh, I got you. Okay. That's it. Mod your mom. Oh, fuck. Time's going

1520
05:18:41,849 --> 05:18:51,799
by. I got to pause. But, so Laris, I know that this, depending on what state you're in, I know,

1521
05:18:51,799 --> 05:18:56,439
especially if you live in a place like New York, New York is all over the place right now. It's

1522
05:18:56,439 --> 05:19:00,840
difficult to know exactly what's going to happen because they have almost, what, 30, 40% of all the

1523
05:19:00,840 --> 05:19:07,610
cases are in New York. That's just, that's fucked. We're in a really kind of fucking weird time

1524
05:19:07,610 --> 05:19:14,419
right now for everybody, especially if you're in one of these hot zones. So it's realistically just

1525
05:19:14,419 --> 05:19:20,340
about trying to just follow the guidelines and hopefully we can get over this and vaccines can

1526
05:19:20,340 --> 05:19:34,680
get produced. Everybody wants the same thing. Thanks for the $69. Really appreciate it. Thanks

1527
05:19:34,680 --> 05:19:46,310
for hanging out. I know we're talking about some serious, I probably should have paused the game

1528
05:19:46,310 --> 05:19:52,520
and put like the music and dialogue on zero. I'm sitting here talking about like, oh, let me tell

1529
05:19:52,520 --> 05:20:00,139
you something. Let's talk about this. It's very important stuff. And it's like trains going by,

1530
05:20:00,139 --> 05:20:08,459
people screaming at us. All right. Let's go back to what we were doing. And what were we doing

1531
05:20:08,459 --> 05:20:14,220
exactly? Oh yeah. We were fucking cutting up ecstasy and putting fillers in it and selling it to

1532
05:20:14,220 --> 05:20:25,319
people. All right. Can I clean my office? This is not an office. Yes, it is. Of course it is.

1533
05:20:27,560 --> 05:20:36,819
All right. What are my orders look like? Okay. Thanks. Your total debt was $350. I did it.

1534
05:20:37,459 --> 05:20:43,319
I got cash. Okay. We're going to need to collect the money from that. We need six grams of marijuana

1535
05:20:43,319 --> 05:20:54,090
urgent, eight grams of marijuana, N grams of marijuana. Damn. Do I have that? I do, right?

1536
05:20:55,290 --> 05:21:08,900
Yeah, I do. Of course I do. I'm prepared. And we got our money. Make sure I don't have any

1537
05:21:08,900 --> 05:21:17,180
bullshit here. Uh, put the cash away. The ecstasy. I'll keep the ecstasy. Give us people free.

1538
05:21:17,819 --> 05:21:23,619
Should you take a break soon? Yeah, I'll probably, I'll probably be done streaming the next

1539
05:21:25,259 --> 05:21:30,599
like 30, 40 minutes, something like that. I think I like this game though. I kind of want to keep

1540
05:21:30,599 --> 05:21:38,939
playing it, but I've got stuff to do tomorrow and Tuesday. Why do I have to have responsibilities

1541
05:21:38,939 --> 05:21:44,840
to do? I, that's not, I don't want to do that. I want to sell, I want to sell virtual drugs to

1542
05:21:44,840 --> 05:22:07,290
people. Let's go get the money first. Postmates. Um, I can't postmates. I can't postmates my dog

1543
05:22:07,290 --> 05:22:21,209
to the vet. That's not, I can't do that. 200 bucks. Nice. Please play this. Wait, finally.

1544
05:22:21,209 --> 05:22:34,150
Somebody's calling me. Finally. Eddie, what's up? Hey, expand your apartments in the ghetto.

1545
05:22:39,959 --> 05:22:47,430
Expansion like the Roman Empire. Awesome. I just give you stat boosts.

1546
05:22:50,060 --> 05:23:04,520
Rent a new hideout. Not yet. Oh, there's a guy. This game is cringe.

1547
05:23:08,790 --> 05:23:17,220
Is that a police? Why is there so many police officers here? Oh, there's a hideout here.

1548
05:23:20,380 --> 05:23:31,750
Wait, let me sell this stuff. I need to keep my operation going. What did he want? Six grams of

1549
05:23:31,750 --> 05:23:38,680
marijuana. That's a lot, dude. All right. Well, what are the, what are the fucking people over

1550
05:23:38,680 --> 05:23:51,799
here want some stuff? You're a popular drug dealer. Am I? Hey, what's up, man? Like you can tell that

1551
05:23:51,799 --> 05:23:58,099
guy's on drugs. If your dealer jumps the fence like that, yeah, you can probably be aware that

1552
05:23:58,099 --> 05:24:09,860
they're probably doing something. Hey, do you want something for free? Hey, how about a package of

1553
05:24:09,860 --> 05:24:21,689
good ecstasy for you? Respect is going up. That's good. Hey, James, would you like some marijuana?

1554
05:24:23,849 --> 05:24:35,060
Uh huh. Very cool. Let's go back and see what I can do. Yes, please. You didn't say it like that,

1555
05:24:35,060 --> 05:24:56,979
but I did. And I'm annoyed that I did. Wrong house again. Oh, fuck. Stupid fucking. I am,

1556
05:24:56,979 --> 05:25:17,990
I seriously am the dumbest fucking. I'm a fucking more back in here. All right. Buy a new house.

1557
05:25:21,419 --> 05:25:27,450
Mike Byers. Hey, Eddie was supposed to let you know I'll be contacting you. I'll make things short.

1558
05:25:27,450 --> 05:25:31,290
I have some apartments to rent in the ghetto. They're all owned by my various companies,

1559
05:25:31,290 --> 05:25:35,610
so police can't directly connect you to them. The prices include all the creativity behind it

1560
05:25:35,610 --> 05:25:40,889
in my fee. It ain't cheap as worth it. Oh yeah, I'll be acquiring some more of them in time.

1561
05:25:40,889 --> 05:25:45,700
I'll let you know if any places are available. Hey, I've got some new places in my offer.

1562
05:25:45,700 --> 05:25:54,939
Check them out when you have time. I know it's work not only to storage and lab locations,

1563
05:25:54,939 --> 05:26:01,669
but they also constantly boost your respect in their neighborhood. You can use hideouts for

1564
05:26:01,669 --> 05:26:06,709
waiting, refuge, and most of them save stations, which can be crucial for your progress. To rent

1565
05:26:06,709 --> 05:26:16,680
a hideout, you need to use a bank amount, preferably legal. Ooh, small talks warehouse.

1566
05:26:20,790 --> 05:26:43,290
Ooh, this is fine. What about this one? Stink. Small storage building, it's stink. Plus 5%

1567
05:26:43,369 --> 05:26:57,700
stink. 6% stink. 3% stink. Okay, cool. Got it. All right. I got a stink. I got a stink house.

1568
05:26:59,000 --> 05:27:17,029
Thanks a lot, dude. Nice doing... Okay, bye. Ooh, okay. Unlock new sale areas. Stink. Wait,

1569
05:27:17,029 --> 05:27:25,610
I can't even go there. Go test out furniture mode from your new hideout. Oh yeah. How do I get there?

1570
05:27:26,490 --> 05:27:34,549
Okay, I need 800 respect. Oh, I'm respected now. All right, let's go to that stink house.

1571
05:27:35,189 --> 05:27:38,150
Where is it? All right, let's go to the... Can I even make it to the stink house?

1572
05:27:38,790 --> 05:27:50,580
Is there a way to get there? Let's find out. Don't bring a whole lot of money. Wait,

1573
05:27:50,580 --> 05:27:54,759
should I bring money for the... All right, I'm going to deposit this money into an ATM.

1574
05:27:55,319 --> 05:28:10,540
Sell more fake drugs. I will. Don't worry. I'm going to make it... I'm going to make the best

1575
05:28:10,540 --> 05:28:22,599
fake drugs. Why haven't you smoked any rivals? You mean like roll them up and smoke them like a joint

1576
05:28:22,599 --> 05:28:38,919
or kill them? All right, hold on. Can I go in here now? Oh, how can I help you? Show me your

1577
05:28:38,919 --> 05:28:51,990
products. Wait, I can get beds? Dude, look at this. How much money do I... I don't have any money.

1578
05:28:51,990 --> 05:29:19,380
Do I get a bed? Just a couch? No. No, don't. What? What? Show functional only. What are you

1579
05:29:19,380 --> 05:29:28,889
talking about? Can be used to place... Oh, this is a drugs thing. All right, I need a cabinet.

1580
05:29:28,889 --> 05:29:35,959
I need a cabinet. Order and pay. I need a bed too. Am I not going to have a bed there? 150.

1581
05:29:35,959 --> 05:29:45,500
Buy it. Take it. Put it in the stink hole. Whatever it's called. Put it in the stink hole. Okay, then

1582
05:29:46,139 --> 05:30:09,430
that's it. Is it there? 300, right? Why is the drug dealer stream set up?

1583
05:30:10,869 --> 05:30:20,869
There's not going to be one. Oh, skills. More pockets? Or more stamina? More quick learning?

1584
05:30:20,869 --> 05:30:45,750
Stealth? Salesman? Yeah. Would you like some free drugs? Sure. No, I don't have any. Just kidding.

1585
05:30:46,470 --> 05:31:02,409
Good day. All right, let's go check out the stink hole. This is it? Did I do this? Where's the...

1586
05:31:02,409 --> 05:31:09,349
Do I have a... Do I not have a door? In a hideout, you can launch the furniture by beholding space.

1587
05:31:12,650 --> 05:31:18,819
Okay, well, it's a big shithole. Maybe not exactly what I expected, but... Cool. It's important that

1588
05:31:18,819 --> 05:31:25,700
you like it, right? Because you like it, don't you? How do I put this down? Anyway, a bit of

1589
05:31:25,700 --> 05:31:32,229
furniture and decorations should solve the problem, I hope. Oh, shit. These are stackable.

1590
05:31:58,979 --> 05:32:19,459
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Nice. Okay. Cool. I haven't... What is this? Oh, the sink.

1591
05:32:20,889 --> 05:32:25,290
Hold on a second. Wait, can I actually... Wait, this is the wet thing. Why is there no sink in

1592
05:32:25,290 --> 05:32:30,970
my other house? Wait, there is. I have a bathroom. I couldn't... I can wet the marijuana in the

1593
05:32:30,970 --> 05:32:58,700
bathroom sink. Who is it? Okay, cool. So now what are my tasks? I have to unlock the new sale areas and

1594
05:32:58,700 --> 05:33:16,380
I have to addict five people. Oh, I already went into the furniture shop. I checked out the furniture

1595
05:33:16,380 --> 05:33:25,349
shop here. Yeah, yeah. Cool. Nice. All right. I checked it out. How do I leave? That count

1596
05:33:25,349 --> 05:33:41,849
is checking it out. Earthquake. All right. Well, there's no save point in there, though.

1597
05:33:46,409 --> 05:34:10,630
Imagine buying soaking wet weed. Is that the game? Yeah. All right. I am going to call it here.

1598
05:34:11,270 --> 05:34:18,729
I'm going to try to adhere to the rules that I set for myself a couple weeks ago. The rule,

1599
05:34:18,729 --> 05:34:26,090
doctor's orders, rules. I have to adhere to them. I have to. If I want to actually beg my body better.

1600
05:34:27,130 --> 05:34:35,750
Defunco pop quitter. Fuck the rules. You streamed for eight hours yesterday. Yeah,

1601
05:34:35,750 --> 05:34:43,619
I know. I'm not supposed to be doing that. Don't eat McDonald's. You ate McDonald's,

1602
05:34:43,619 --> 05:34:50,549
though. McDonald's has nothing to do with my bones. But I want to play this game more.

1603
05:34:51,270 --> 05:35:02,470
I want to play this game more. How do I do that? How do I play this game more?

1604
05:35:04,380 --> 05:35:07,659
You might have to take a look at it. We might have to do some schedule changing here.

1605
05:35:07,659 --> 05:35:23,770
I can't play it tomorrow. I can't stream tomorrow. And then Wednesday, Thursday,

1606
05:35:23,770 --> 05:35:32,310
Friday, Saturday. OK, hold on. I figured out what the mystery game is. It's 420. I did play it on

1607
05:35:32,549 --> 05:35:46,759
420 Eastern time. Listen to me. This is important. OK, you ready? So, I'm going to change the

1608
05:35:46,759 --> 05:35:53,110
schedule a little. We're going to play. This is the mystery game because I want to play this more.

1609
05:35:54,150 --> 05:35:59,189
The mystery game was supposed to be on Friday. But, excuse me, the mystery game is moving to

1610
05:35:59,189 --> 05:36:04,150
Wednesday. So mystery game is going to happen on Wednesday. Thursday is going to be the movie

1611
05:36:04,150 --> 05:36:11,159
night. Friday, no. Thursday is going to be... How am I going to do this? Thursday will be

1612
05:36:11,159 --> 05:36:21,049
community content night. Friday will be movie night. Saturday will be Easy Bake Oven. I think

1613
05:36:21,049 --> 05:36:28,500
that works. Movie night makes sense on Friday night. That's a good time to do it. And then

1614
05:36:28,500 --> 05:36:35,819
Saturday is Easy Bake Oven. Yeah, that works. What about Saw the Game? Yeah, I want to play

1615
05:36:35,819 --> 05:36:53,610
this again, though. I'll have a couple glasses of wine on movie night. Do Saw on the next mystery

1616
05:36:53,610 --> 05:37:06,090
game. I have it. I just can't find a reason to play it. All right, so that's the plan. We're

1617
05:37:06,090 --> 05:37:09,689
going to come back with this in a couple days on Wednesday. And then we're going to do it on

1618
05:37:09,689 --> 05:37:15,720
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. And there's a lot of shit to do this week coming up. That's

1619
05:37:15,720 --> 05:37:26,779
the plan. That's what we're going to do. See you on Wednesday. Thanks for watching, as always.

1620
05:37:27,639 --> 05:37:32,119
Had a lot of fun. That's why I want to play it again. Take care of yourselves. We'll see you soon.

1621
05:37:33,479 --> 05:37:37,799
Save the game. Yes, I will. I'm not going to play even one second without you, I promise.

1622
05:37:43,159 --> 05:37:50,540
So we'll see you tomorrow. No, not tomorrow. I'm so dumb. We'll see you on Wednesday.

1623
05:37:51,180 --> 05:37:57,139
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Hey, the chef's corner. 10 more community subs.

1624
05:37:57,139 --> 05:38:08,340
That was that make like 50, 60 tonight from the chef. 10, 20, 30. That's 35 community subs.

1625
05:38:08,979 --> 05:38:19,319
You have to do force 20. No, I did on 420. I played it for 30 minutes on 420. See you

1626
05:38:19,319 --> 05:38:26,759
guys in a couple of days. Thanks for watching. Much love to you. Get some sleep. Fix your

1627
05:38:26,759 --> 05:38:34,950
Reddit room. Don't worry. I'll rearrange it and make it look even better. See you guys soon.

1628
05:38:34,950 --> 05:38:42,619
Thank you to the chef's corner. Not only for your insane monetary contributions

1629
05:38:42,619 --> 05:38:46,459
through the course of the night with your huge bits and your huge community subs,

1630
05:38:46,459 --> 05:38:52,819
but you also gave $10 earlier as well. Find your webcam mic and peek it right now.

1631
05:38:54,500 --> 05:39:05,639
No, I can't do that. Okay, I promise. There you go. I peeked it. I peeked it by smacking into

1632
05:39:05,639 --> 05:39:13,830
you. All right, listen. Unlike the 30 webcam stream, I'm going to try to break one of the

1633
05:39:13,830 --> 05:39:19,580
webcam mics as hard as I can. I will put my mouth... I'm going to just scream in the room

1634
05:39:20,220 --> 05:39:26,099
and there'll be 30 different webcams screaming all at different delays. I promise I will do

1635
05:39:26,099 --> 05:39:35,060
that at least once. Plus, we got to plan that one out because I'm soon here. I'm going to start to

1636
05:39:35,060 --> 05:39:42,970
try to do the process when they come back in stock to buy them. Remember, we're talking about

1637
05:39:42,970 --> 05:39:47,049
I'm going to do... I'm going to fight... I'm going to have a brawl in the room. I'm going to fight

1638
05:39:47,049 --> 05:39:53,930
myself with 30 different people. I'm going to chop myself up into at least 20 different pieces

1639
05:39:53,930 --> 05:40:01,029
to do a puzzle. Put myself back together again. I'm going to try to have a conversation, a full

1640
05:40:01,029 --> 05:40:11,209
conversation with 30 people. It's going to fail. Oh no, it will not. It's going to work out very

1641
05:40:11,209 --> 05:40:27,240
well. Do a concert. Yeah. Do a full singing concert. You did the webcam delay joke. Yeah,

1642
05:40:27,240 --> 05:40:33,450
I know, with the top rope. I was with two. What happens when you add like 15 more combatants?

1643
05:40:34,979 --> 05:40:41,659
All delayed at different times because you can delay a webcam on OBS by like a full,

1644
05:40:41,659 --> 05:40:52,619
almost a full minute, two minutes. Maybe more than that. It's going to be crazy. Yeah, I will.

1645
05:40:52,619 --> 05:40:57,180
Jeff, I will peak it. I promise. Sticks Renegade, thanks for the 250. Hey, Jerma, thank you playing

1646
05:40:57,180 --> 05:41:03,720
Jackie Chan Adventures as the mystery game later this week. Oh, mystery game is going to be not a

1647
05:41:03,720 --> 05:41:11,779
mystery anymore because it's going to be crack crew. What's the, what's this called? Drug dealer.

1648
05:41:11,779 --> 05:41:18,380
I don't know what the game's called. Thank you. Sticks Renegade for the 250 and another 250.

1649
05:41:19,700 --> 05:41:26,869
Sorry. I mean stunt master, sir. Canine. Thanks for the 250. Toon town is a dystopian future

1650
05:41:26,869 --> 05:41:30,790
where the tunes are in a constant struggle with the humans for their civil rights.

1651
05:41:31,349 --> 05:41:36,549
The humans created the cogs as a means to gather tunes to work in slave camps on the surface

1652
05:41:36,549 --> 05:41:43,459
that the humans used to proliferate their existence. The actual lore kind of fucked up.

1653
05:41:46,419 --> 05:41:50,099
LM man, thanks for the $5. Jerma, I'm only giving you these bits so I can call you out.

1654
05:41:51,819 --> 05:41:57,500
You were an inspiration to us all and now you are nothing more than a greed infused drug dealer.

1655
05:41:58,220 --> 05:42:04,099
No, it's fake. It's all, it's all, it's all, it's make believe. It's like when you used to go

1656
05:42:05,220 --> 05:42:09,779
hang out when you were a little kid and make Play-Doh food. That's what this is. This is my

1657
05:42:09,779 --> 05:42:18,169
Play-Doh food. It's just Play-Doh food. There's nothing else. Big Mama, thanks for the $15.

1658
05:42:19,580 --> 05:42:27,259
1500 bits from Big Mama. This is great. I love drugs and crime. Well, I hope that's not true.

1659
05:42:27,259 --> 05:42:34,650
Thanks for the $15. Real doll, thanks for the $5. Two things, Jerma. Okay. One, marijuana was

1660
05:42:34,650 --> 05:42:41,290
originally spelled with an H, but it was replaced to a J so it will be more associated with Mexican

1661
05:42:41,290 --> 05:42:47,900
immigrants. Two, how do you feel about the lack of proper bots in modern games, particularly

1662
05:42:47,900 --> 05:42:58,569
shooters? What do you mean the lack of bots? Like when you play CSGO versus like Bot Bill,

1663
05:42:58,569 --> 05:43:08,979
Bot Frank, bot, as you mean? I think it's because so many people play them now.

1664
05:43:10,659 --> 05:43:15,060
Why program bots when you have a shooter but people are just going to play it anyways?

1665
05:43:15,700 --> 05:43:23,580
I think too many people play online shooters now. Where would you put bots in like a Battlegrounds

1666
05:43:23,580 --> 05:43:32,020
game? Unless it's like PUBG mobile. I mean, you could do like an offline mode, I guess, maybe.

1667
05:43:32,819 --> 05:43:42,569
Perfect Dark had awesome bots. Perfect Dark also had the best weapon in any game.

1668
05:43:43,290 --> 05:43:48,619
The one where you could shoot and see through walls. That was the worst thing ever. And it

1669
05:43:48,619 --> 05:43:53,939
was an instant kill. I remember getting so angry and being so happy when I had that,

1670
05:43:53,939 --> 05:44:00,520
but when I got killed by that, it was horrible. Yes, in the original Perfect Dark for Nintendo 64,

1671
05:44:01,159 --> 05:44:07,319
the weapon was called Farsight. And what it did is it let you see through every wall

1672
05:44:07,319 --> 05:44:12,200
and thermo outlined every other player. And you could shoot through every single wall.

1673
05:44:12,200 --> 05:44:20,790
You just had to target them and kill them instantly. And it was in the game. Yes.

1674
05:44:21,349 --> 05:44:30,779
Anyways, thanks for the $5. Hey, Omni Cash. Thanks for the 300 bits. The first time I

1675
05:44:30,779 --> 05:44:35,689
catch your stream and this is what I see. We're just making Play Doh hamburgers.

1676
05:44:37,540 --> 05:44:40,340
And I ate a couple of Play Doh hamburgers earlier, so it's all good.

1677
05:44:41,139 --> 05:44:47,029
Omni Cash again, $5. This should be enough to buy some whipped cream.

1678
05:44:48,310 --> 05:44:50,950
Still though, I can't believe none of you guys got, like did that.

1679
05:44:52,740 --> 05:44:58,380
That's like, I can't, that's bonkers to me. Not even one time when you were like a kid or anything.

1680
05:45:02,340 --> 05:45:07,619
Mr. Lester. Thank you, Mr. Lester for the $5. German never been able to catch a stream till today.

1681
05:45:08,259 --> 05:45:18,200
Nice to hear your voice live. We are live. But hey, welcome. Thanks for checking out the stream.

1682
05:45:18,200 --> 05:45:25,750
Hope you liked it. Thanks for the $5. Dark Soul. Thanks for the 250. Hey,

1683
05:45:25,750 --> 05:45:28,470
made a really great stream and hope to see you return to VR one day.

1684
05:45:29,590 --> 05:45:38,700
You will. And the VR is going to be way better. Because I'm going to have a better space for it.

1685
05:45:40,180 --> 05:45:45,400
I'm going to have probably two, probably two times more space when I set it up.

1686
05:45:46,970 --> 05:45:53,049
So instead of being in a small little office cube, I'm going to make sure I'm in a bigger room.

1687
05:45:57,500 --> 05:46:01,819
Not a Reddit room, but actually the Reddit, you know, this is, this is accurate. The Reddit

1688
05:46:01,819 --> 05:46:17,099
room is bigger. I have a much bigger Reddit room now. I'm able to do it. So there'll be more. I'll

1689
05:46:17,099 --> 05:46:21,180
be able to actually, remember how, how many times I'd be like, what the fuck is, I can't even,

1690
05:46:21,180 --> 05:46:29,590
why is it not tracking me? Oh, fuck. Is that the wall? That will not happen. I will be able to

1691
05:46:29,590 --> 05:46:40,099
full stride, walk around like a dickhead, looking forward to it. But yeah, we will return. If you

1692
05:46:40,099 --> 05:46:47,880
ever do go back though, if you ever set up Skyrim VR properly, you can get porn mods and make

1693
05:46:47,880 --> 05:46:56,250
everyone think you're playing Skyrim, but no, it's porn. I'm not going to get porn mods. I would get

1694
05:46:56,250 --> 05:47:06,459
suspended from Twitch. They would remove me from the platform. Vimthral, thanks for the 300 bits.

1695
05:47:06,459 --> 05:47:11,740
This one's going to be hard to read. This one's going to be very hard to read. In fact, I'm not

1696
05:47:11,740 --> 05:47:26,380
going to read it. It's just fucking weird. It's, uh, it says, no drug man. Don't put your feet in

1697
05:47:26,380 --> 05:47:32,299
the mash. Ha ha ha. Your feet will get so sticky and gross. Ha ha. The mash will, yeah, it'll grow

1698
05:47:32,299 --> 05:47:37,419
on the, at least on the, on their face. What? Okay. Thanks for the three bucks. Anonymous

1699
05:47:37,419 --> 05:47:43,450
Cheerer, thanks for the 250. Just anonymous. Mitchell, thanks for the five dollars. And once

1700
05:47:43,450 --> 05:47:52,759
again, this shit is fucked. Thanks to the drug grub girls, the drug grub, the drug, the drug of

1701
05:47:52,759 --> 05:48:02,759
girls. Oh, the Powerpuff Girls thing. Right. Right, right, right. Hey, S10, double the update, slow

1702
05:48:02,759 --> 05:48:08,779
update. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jeremiah, I love this Half-Life multiplayer dark RP. I read this

1703
05:48:08,779 --> 05:48:13,240
earlier because I thought it was funny. Anyways, glad to see you again. Not sure if I'm stepping

1704
05:48:13,240 --> 05:48:19,400
out of line here, but I would, I'd love to see you play Bioshock 2 on stream. The personal

1705
05:48:19,400 --> 05:48:25,459
favorite of mine. I'm just glad to watch you again. Peace and love. Uh, I've played through

1706
05:48:26,259 --> 05:48:33,240
Bioshock Infinite. I watched somebody play through all of Bioshock and Bioshock 2 did not exist in

1707
05:48:33,240 --> 05:48:44,180
my brain. So that's the one that I had not actually done or seen. People say that's the good one,

1708
05:48:44,180 --> 05:48:50,840
right? Although people say Bioshock 1 is more storyline wise is actually more interesting

1709
05:48:50,840 --> 05:49:05,430
versus Bioshock 2's gameplay improvements. Am I correct here? Just making sure I got it right.

1710
05:49:06,229 --> 05:49:12,139
Uh, but yeah, I mean, I'm not, I can't say I wouldn't. It's a fantastic series. The series is

1711
05:49:12,139 --> 05:49:20,869
great. Eventually. Yeah. Still have to play Doom, but I probably never will. Mitchell, thanks to the

1712
05:49:20,869 --> 05:49:26,310
$5. I figured this game out. You're a synthetic human made specifically for the purpose of being

1713
05:49:26,310 --> 05:49:31,110
an expert drug dealer. That's why the only dealer and why the cops are only interested in you

1714
05:49:31,750 --> 05:49:36,229
and why the inventory screen doesn't show your face. You become good enough and are released

1715
05:49:36,869 --> 05:49:47,479
and they move on to the next sin. That's an interesting theory. LM man. Thanks for the

1716
05:49:47,479 --> 05:49:53,240
250. German. Have you ever played Heavy Rain? Um, we've gone over Heavy Rain a few times.

1717
05:49:53,959 --> 05:49:57,959
I know everything about the whole game. I know the whole story. I know the spoilers.

1718
05:49:57,959 --> 05:50:05,049
I know how it ends. I know how it begins. So I only really like to play games on this stream

1719
05:50:05,049 --> 05:50:10,169
that I don't know anything about unless it's one of those games that I love so much that I

1720
05:50:10,169 --> 05:50:17,770
want to show you guys because I like it so much. So I won't be playing Heavy Rain. There's a lot

1721
05:50:17,770 --> 05:50:23,029
of games that I won't play just because I already know the whole thing. I've already played it before.

1722
05:50:23,830 --> 05:50:30,580
I like this stream to be, uh, genuinely things I've never done before because it makes it more

1723
05:50:30,580 --> 05:50:41,700
interesting for me. Like Beautiful Joe. Yeah, but that's, I, but that falls into the category

1724
05:50:41,700 --> 05:50:49,500
of things that I really love and wanted to show you and that backfired. So that falls in that

1725
05:50:49,500 --> 05:51:03,099
category. Binding of Isaac? Binding of Isaac is a game that it's different every time. You won't see

1726
05:51:03,099 --> 05:51:06,619
the same thing every time when you play Binding of Isaac. It's a different game every time. That's

1727
05:51:06,619 --> 05:51:21,450
the nature of the game. Next question, please. I mean, false. How is that not true? No two Binding

1728
05:51:21,450 --> 05:51:27,400
of Isaac games are the same. They can have very, very close similarities, but you're not going to

1729
05:51:27,400 --> 05:51:33,619
get the same exact experience every single time. That's one of my favorite games. Don't you dare

1730
05:51:33,619 --> 05:51:40,659
make fun of it? Uh, let's show the credits. I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to bump you

1731
05:51:40,659 --> 05:51:45,659
right in the face here. I'm just warning you. Here it comes. Just watch out. Play No More Heroes 2

1732
05:51:45,740 --> 05:51:54,819
already. Jesus Christ. A lot of twos that I have to just be happy that we actually played Black and

1733
05:51:54,819 --> 05:52:02,889
White 2. You know what I mean? Like that's another two that we did at least. I need to play Mario

1734
05:52:02,889 --> 05:52:17,049
Galaxy. I don't know. Why am I going to do anything? I want No More Heroes 2. Who's the artist

1735
05:52:17,049 --> 05:52:23,740
that made this for you? That would be Blordow. Very, very funny. Very, very, very, very talented

1736
05:52:23,740 --> 05:52:36,299
person. Got a great style. He's got a really, really unique way he does everything. I mean,

1737
05:52:36,299 --> 05:52:45,049
I've known each other for a very long time. It's great. He promised Patapon. Yeah, I almost

1738
05:52:45,049 --> 05:52:48,970
promised. I, I, I, I promised I was going to eat a shoe and that happened in like three months

1739
05:52:48,970 --> 05:53:00,459
after I said it. A promise is still a promise if it does happen. He promised Toontown. And you're

1740
05:53:00,459 --> 05:53:08,979
going to get Toontown. Just not right this second. He's an eternal liar. Fine. Just keep it like that.

1741
05:53:08,979 --> 05:53:16,900
I'm eternal lying. Hey, thanks. Dark Soul for the 250. Cheesecake Factory Smokehouse Barbecue

1742
05:53:16,900 --> 05:53:23,540
Burger is great. Also, Five Guys sucks. It's like $13 for a bacon cheeseburger and you may as well

1743
05:53:23,540 --> 05:53:33,110
get a diner burger or restaurant takeout burger at that price. I, I, listen, regardless of how you

1744
05:53:33,110 --> 05:53:43,669
feel about Five Guys, the restaurant's quality is better than McDonald's. It just is. The restaurant's

1745
05:53:43,750 --> 05:53:49,590
quality is higher than McDonald's. That doesn't mean that, but they're, they're completely

1746
05:53:49,590 --> 05:54:01,130
different restaurants. Cannot compare. Five Guys and McDonald's, they're doing completely different

1747
05:54:01,130 --> 05:54:09,369
things. One of those restaurants has an incredible huge menu of tons of different things. McChickens,

1748
05:54:10,419 --> 05:54:16,659
cheap. It's, you know, is it like the greatest quality? I mean, not, probably not. No.

1749
05:54:17,540 --> 05:54:23,139
But it's good. It's food. It's hearty. It makes you feel good. You feel, well, after maybe six or

1750
05:54:23,139 --> 05:54:26,819
seven hours, maybe you feel a little bloated, but if you eat too much of it, don't eat too much of

1751
05:54:26,819 --> 05:54:33,540
it and you'll be fine. Versus the other place, which is expensive, great. The hamburger quality

1752
05:54:33,540 --> 05:54:38,500
is very good, but the points get knocked off a little bit when they give you the bag of,

1753
05:54:38,500 --> 05:54:44,900
of just ground, essentially julienned up potatoes in a bag that weighs like six and a half pounds.

1754
05:54:45,860 --> 05:54:59,590
I'm not a fan of the Five Guys fries at all. It's, they're just like, they're just,

1755
05:54:59,590 --> 05:55:04,919
just sliced up potato pieces that they just stuff in a bag and it just weighs the bag down in the

1756
05:55:04,919 --> 05:55:09,959
bag. It's all heavy and like oily on the bottom. And it's just a potato-y, I don't know, they don't

1757
05:55:09,959 --> 05:55:25,819
like them. They're very potato-y. I like my French fries to be shoestring. I like them uniform. I

1758
05:55:25,819 --> 05:55:31,180
like them to be able to be pushed in, folded and crunched in my mouth. I don't like thick,

1759
05:55:31,259 --> 05:55:38,220
I hate potato wedges. Let's make that clear. I don't like thick potato wedges or thick cut

1760
05:55:38,220 --> 05:55:46,759
potato-y fries. Potato wedges don't do it for me. It's too much starch, too like mushy and

1761
05:55:46,759 --> 05:55:59,189
starchy in your mouth. No, not for me. Maybe for you, not for me. But what about waffle fries?

1762
05:55:59,189 --> 05:56:13,720
They're incredible. The skin, the skin of potato wedges is like Reese's paper. I didn't say that.

1763
05:56:14,599 --> 05:56:19,560
I did not say that. Somebody else did. So you can be mad at that person, not me.

1764
05:56:22,790 --> 05:56:30,200
That's fucking hilarious. I'm going to use that from now on. It's very good. That was like a solid

1765
05:56:30,200 --> 05:56:45,130
like 8.8 out of 10 comment. It's like Reese's paper. Oh, potatoes are gross. Yuck. Anyways,

1766
05:56:47,689 --> 05:56:59,779
8.7, 8.9. I don't know. What did the Hulk get? 8.9. I thought Hulk got 8.8. Now that I think about

1767
05:56:59,779 --> 05:57:09,259
it, I don't really like potatoes. I really kind of just don't. I remember. This is a real story.

1768
05:57:09,259 --> 05:57:20,490
Are you ready to get the truth here? I remember ordering HelloFresh. HelloFresh is a subscription

1769
05:57:20,490 --> 05:57:25,610
service for food. It seemed like, oh, this is interesting. Let me, let me, let's try this.

1770
05:57:25,610 --> 05:57:31,529
Yeah, that sounds good. And it was Kim, I, it's Alex. It was like, this sounds like a good idea.

1771
05:57:31,529 --> 05:57:35,770
This makes sense. You know, we can just have food here. We can cook it and it just gets sense.

1772
05:57:35,770 --> 05:57:44,250
Whatever. We tried it like other people have tried in the past. And every meal, almost every

1773
05:57:44,250 --> 05:57:50,490
single one, at least seven out of 10 of these meals all just had fucking potato chunks

1774
05:57:51,369 --> 05:57:55,849
for their side. It was like, oh, hamburger and potato chunks.

1775
05:57:58,360 --> 05:58:01,880
How about this green bean casserole with potato chunks on the side?

1776
05:58:04,520 --> 05:58:15,110
Steak with potato chunks. Salmon with potato chunks. And it was like, this is fucking stupid.

1777
05:58:15,750 --> 05:58:23,400
I want, I don't want to eat like, I don't want to eat like home fries with every single meal.

1778
05:58:24,040 --> 05:58:36,810
Why are you not eating rice? What are you talking about? What? I don't want, I don't want to eat like

1779
05:58:37,770 --> 05:58:42,970
potato cubes every meal. Does that make me weird or crazy? No. What?

1780
05:58:44,250 --> 05:58:51,369
It was like five or six out of 10 meals were just potato cubes or potato wedges, potato cubes,

1781
05:58:51,369 --> 05:58:58,009
potato wedges, home fries, potato cubes, potato wedges, potato fries, potato, potato, potato.

1782
05:58:58,810 --> 05:59:10,310
And that's not even why I canceled it. You know why I actually decided that we, that we weren't

1783
05:59:10,310 --> 05:59:17,740
going to get that service anymore. And this is real. This is, this is, this is like a review.

1784
05:59:17,740 --> 05:59:21,419
This is a review of that service, although this is like a year and a half ago. So don't take this

1785
05:59:21,419 --> 05:59:25,419
review that seriously, I guess, because maybe they've changed it. Packages would be fucking open.

1786
05:59:26,810 --> 05:59:31,209
Like we'd get meat sent to us and like one of the packages of meat would just be

1787
05:59:31,209 --> 05:59:35,610
fucking open and like leaking. Like, okay, great. I throw this in the trash now. Thanks a lot.

1788
05:59:36,409 --> 05:59:48,700
What's the best restaurant in Vegas? That's Hash House. I'll go with the link

1789
05:59:49,860 --> 05:59:58,299
or Carson kitchen downtown and a fucking refund. I just was like,

1790
05:59:59,419 --> 06:00:02,939
look, you know, okay, let me just tell you, let me be very, very clear. It only happened

1791
06:00:03,819 --> 06:00:08,380
maybe like three or four times, but on the third or fourth time that happening, it's like, all right.

1792
06:00:09,659 --> 06:00:15,560
No, thanks. Don't want to do this anymore. So, you know, you get like three strikes in my opinion

1793
06:00:15,560 --> 06:00:28,599
with something like that. Goodbye. This is my opinion. These are my opinions about real opinion

1794
06:00:28,599 --> 06:00:34,680
of some of these food services. This has really happened. I've really made a phone call and really

1795
06:00:34,680 --> 06:00:37,479
talked about this and really said, Hey, please cancel. Cause I don't want you to send me food.

1796
06:00:37,479 --> 06:00:50,380
That's just fucking open. And they were like, okay. I was like, okay, bye. Thank you. Remember

1797
06:00:50,380 --> 06:00:58,229
your opinions are as consistent as your schedule. I don't have a schedule. So that's fine. What

1798
06:00:58,229 --> 06:01:07,340
schedule are you talking about? The one that doesn't exist. So it doesn't matter. All my opinions

1799
06:01:07,419 --> 06:01:18,340
are my own, right? By the way, um, why do people say that? Like if you, okay, if you work for a

1800
06:01:18,340 --> 06:01:21,540
company and it's like, by the way, it's one of the, you guys know my opinions are my own.

1801
06:01:22,700 --> 06:01:29,259
Like, what are you, what did, did, did, did BNB realty not sanction you talking about how, um,

1802
06:01:29,259 --> 06:01:37,240
like you shit your pants today. They like tell you to say that they can say shit and not get fired.

1803
06:01:42,939 --> 06:01:49,750
All my opinions are my own opinions. All right. But isn't that, isn't that just true anyways?

1804
06:01:56,759 --> 06:02:10,340
I thought you were ending. It's also pertinent to if you serve in the military. That makes sense.

1805
06:02:10,979 --> 06:02:15,669
They're saying that their opinions are theirs and not their companies. What if their companies

1806
06:02:15,669 --> 06:02:22,040
are not in their biographies? Okay. What if you, what if you're just like, Jake Stevenson is my

1807
06:02:22,040 --> 06:02:27,080
Twitter profile. I don't, I don't tell you who I work for. Just that's my, that's just my profile.

1808
06:02:27,080 --> 06:02:36,229
Just Jake Stevenson. People are going to find out who you work for and then

1809
06:02:36,310 --> 06:02:51,430
tell Ashley employer if that's what they covering the trail. Do you not know this? No, I like,

1810
06:02:51,430 --> 06:02:57,860
I know. I understand like why, but like at the same time, I was always thinking like, wait, isn't,

1811
06:02:58,500 --> 06:03:03,380
if your opinions aren't your, you have to say that a company, a company is really that annoying.

1812
06:03:05,659 --> 06:03:12,759
Jake, German, nine, eight, five Stevenson. Hey, don't talk about the perfume you bought.

1813
06:03:13,799 --> 06:03:23,619
It's me from B and B realty. What did you say? Let me look. You better tell people that I wasn't

1814
06:03:23,619 --> 06:03:29,380
me that said that. No, it's not because it's not you. It's me saying it. Are you sure?

1815
06:03:30,470 --> 06:03:36,630
But people, people say that I said that. No, it's my, it's my, it's my profile and my,

1816
06:03:36,630 --> 06:03:51,560
I'm typing it. I have my eyes on you. Jake, by the way, you're working on Sunday.

1817
06:03:52,040 --> 06:04:15,060
Fucking asshole. That was a state farm joke. Wait, they, what? Hey, wait, that happened.

1818
06:04:15,700 --> 06:04:31,959
This happens in a state farm commercial. Anyways, thanks. Who, I don't know. Who even said that?

1819
06:04:31,959 --> 06:04:38,099
Who told me that? Somebody said that. Who said that? Why don't we just talk? Why are we talking

1820
06:04:38,099 --> 06:04:42,900
about that? Who said that? Oh yeah. Potato, which is a gross. That's it. There you go.

1821
06:04:42,900 --> 06:04:48,180
Opinions are my own. Opinions are my own and not representative of the German nine,

1822
06:04:48,180 --> 06:04:57,700
eight, five enterprises. But guess what? They are. They are. Cause that's, it's me too.

1823
06:05:02,939 --> 06:05:18,700
I like potato wedges. You little fuck. Delete that tweet. Hey Art Vanderlay. Thanks for the

1824
06:05:18,700 --> 06:05:24,459
$5. I'm watching this stream from work right now. I work in a first responders station.

1825
06:05:24,459 --> 06:05:29,930
I've been pulling 60 plus hour weeks and your stream is helping keep me sane and less stressed.

1826
06:05:30,810 --> 06:05:38,409
Thanks for that. Thanks for doing what you're doing. What you're doing is exponentially more

1827
06:05:38,409 --> 06:05:49,159
important. Thank you for the $5 and thanks for continuing to do that shit because it can be a

1828
06:05:49,159 --> 06:06:08,380
lot. No, it's not for Tony. Thanks for the $5. Hopefully, hopefully you can get a break soon

1829
06:06:09,180 --> 06:06:17,430
from all this. Take care of yourself. Crypto. Thanks for the thousand bits. Hi,

1830
06:06:17,430 --> 06:06:21,669
Jerma. A friend told me about you a year ago. I've been watching your VODs ever since.

1831
06:06:25,029 --> 06:06:28,950
Sorry, I ate two or three McChickens and a Big Mac in like fucking eight minutes.

1832
06:06:29,509 --> 06:06:33,430
Give me a minute. Wait a minute. Did it happen? Is it there or no? It almost happened.

1833
06:06:34,939 --> 06:06:37,819
Jerma, a friend told me about you a year ago and I've been watching your VODs ever since.

1834
06:06:37,819 --> 06:06:41,580
Haven't, God, haven't been able to watch you live because of the time zone difference.

1835
06:06:42,139 --> 06:06:46,380
Been meaning to donate for a long time. So here, feed your love for McChickens. Funny you bring

1836
06:06:46,380 --> 06:06:59,590
that up. Well, that's funny you say that. Um, I will. I will. Chef's Corner, thanks for

1837
06:06:59,590 --> 06:07:06,439
10 more dollars on top of the hundreds today. Thanks a lot. Love you all. Hope you all survive

1838
06:07:06,439 --> 06:07:12,340
this crazy quarantine shit. Have a good night. Right back at you. Thank you so much, Chef's

1839
06:07:12,340 --> 06:07:24,619
Corner. Appreciate it. Let's show the subs. Show them. Did they come? Roll them. These are all the

1840
06:07:24,619 --> 06:07:29,770
community subs, all the regular subs, all the long-term, new-term, everybody. Thanks a lot,

1841
06:07:29,770 --> 06:07:45,110
guys. This ungrateful streamer hates donations. Why does everybody capitalize hates? Why can't

1842
06:07:45,110 --> 06:07:53,029
you lowercase it? Makes me sound bad. No, but thank you guys, seriously. All of you. All of

1843
06:07:53,029 --> 06:08:00,540
your subscriptions. You don't have to do it. You're never obligated to. But a lot of you still do,

1844
06:08:00,540 --> 06:08:10,759
so all I can say is thanks. AppleShift, thanks for 250. Hey, yo, have you ever played The Last of Us?

1845
06:08:10,759 --> 06:08:15,240
It's pretty dialogue and cutscene heavy, but I just played it for the first time last week.

1846
06:08:15,240 --> 06:08:21,319
It was so good. I'm bummed that the second game is delayed indefinitely, though. I have played

1847
06:08:21,319 --> 06:08:27,529
The Last of Us, although I've never finished The Last of Us. The Last of Us sits in that same category

1848
06:08:27,529 --> 06:08:37,590
of thought of war, where I put more than probably 10 to 15 hours into it, maybe got to about the

1849
06:08:38,229 --> 06:08:43,509
40, 50, 60 percent of the way through the game, and then stopped. It happens twice now. Three

1850
06:08:43,509 --> 06:08:50,099
times or so. I did that, and that happens more than that. I do that a lot. But yes, I have played

1851
06:08:50,099 --> 06:09:02,119
The Last of Us. Very good. God of War was awesome. It was hard to just sit down and play it. Not

1852
06:09:02,119 --> 06:09:09,060
because the game was any bad, but because, I mean, it was the first hour of God of War for PS4.

1853
06:09:09,700 --> 06:09:13,299
That's one of the best hours of any single game I've ever played.

1854
06:09:14,099 --> 06:09:23,939
There's no question. The first hour and 30 minutes of God of War has to be up there in the top five

1855
06:09:23,939 --> 06:09:34,819
or like best first tutorial plus zones, areas ever. Only the one hour and 30. No, I played for like

1856
06:09:34,819 --> 06:09:41,540
15, 20 hours. I got to like the halfway point or something. Dr. Clay, thanks for five dollars.

1857
06:09:41,540 --> 06:09:46,180
You mentioned Perfect Dark. I really do miss playing that game. The frame rate was terrible,

1858
06:09:46,180 --> 06:09:51,220
but that game was so ahead of its time. I remember playing Combat Simulator all the time with my

1859
06:09:51,220 --> 06:10:01,110
bro and friends. Good times. Fist Sim was the worst. Always punching and making you dizzy.

1860
06:10:01,909 --> 06:10:13,880
Sorry you got the frog tonight. Yeah, no, Perfect Dark. GoldenEye and Perfect Dark. I used to play

1861
06:10:13,880 --> 06:10:23,319
with three other friends on a probably 19-inch CRT TV, and each person had a fourth of the screen.

1862
06:10:24,819 --> 06:10:40,069
Those were the real days, weren't they? Those were the days. Okay, Grandpa. That's fine. That's fine.

1863
06:10:40,069 --> 06:10:48,090
Call me Grandpa. Call me Mr. Boomer Man. Whatever you want to say. That sucked. It was horrendous

1864
06:10:48,810 --> 06:10:54,779
sharing a fourth of a screen in a game that ran at 12 FPS. Barely when we can have our

1865
06:10:54,779 --> 06:11:00,939
own goddamn screens now and have fidelity of like 4k and have the internet and have a thousand

1866
06:11:00,939 --> 06:11:05,979
thousand fiber connection. God, the old days were terrible. These new days are so much fucking better.

1867
06:11:05,979 --> 06:11:12,779
Holy shit. Usability, accessibility. My god, how bad was it back in like the fucking early 90s?

1868
06:11:13,900 --> 06:11:33,400
But I still loved it. It still was the most fun thing at the time. It was amazing. I loved all

1869
06:11:33,400 --> 06:11:40,500
my time. And those are some of the times when games, the pavement of the gaming roads that you

1870
06:11:40,500 --> 06:11:48,900
drive on today were paved back then. Every game system that you think is cool, everything that

1871
06:11:48,900 --> 06:11:55,189
you like, the road was paved. You're driving on that road now, and that road was paved

1872
06:11:56,630 --> 06:12:05,369
15, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. It's a great road. And that road, by the way, has no,

1873
06:12:06,090 --> 06:12:11,049
there's no potholes. There's a few potholes on that road. You can avoid them though. Just like

1874
06:12:11,049 --> 06:12:16,279
slowly, you know, go slow and don't run them over. It's still a pretty good road.

1875
06:12:23,770 --> 06:12:31,700
Fucking fantastic analogy. God, you're fucking so good. Dungeonist, thanks for the thousand bits.

1876
06:12:32,659 --> 06:12:38,900
Remember, the lockdown in New Zealand is extremely strict, so I haven't had takeout for over a month.

1877
06:12:40,069 --> 06:12:44,069
McDonald's McChickens with extra mayo is my favorite food, so fuck you for getting my

1878
06:12:44,069 --> 06:12:48,310
favorite food when I'm starving. But seriously, thanks for being my source of vitamin J over the

1879
06:12:48,310 --> 06:12:57,479
lockdown. Love you, Jerry. I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm sorry that everybody around the

1880
06:12:57,479 --> 06:13:03,020
world, especially in some of the places that have really, really, really heavy lockdowns, because

1881
06:13:05,180 --> 06:13:12,700
yeah, around here, the orders are in place, but takeout and delivery is still, without contact,

1882
06:13:12,700 --> 06:13:20,439
you know, is still available. So I can't even imagine locking down even more than that.

1883
06:13:20,840 --> 06:13:32,759
It's probably so fucking hard. Stay with it. Hang in there. I hope the best for you

1884
06:13:33,479 --> 06:13:51,529
and everybody in New Zealand. Hopefully it's over soon. Take care of yourself. Thanks for the 10

1885
06:13:51,529 --> 06:13:57,849
bucks. Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250. Stop talking about Hash House or GoGo. I'm sick of it.

1886
06:13:57,849 --> 06:14:04,840
But what if you found something that was the best thing you've ever had? What if you had to tell

1887
06:14:04,840 --> 06:14:14,150
people? You need people to know of this thing that's the best thing ever and people need to

1888
06:14:14,150 --> 06:14:28,099
be told. They need to know. No, that's not to do with sponsorships. That's to do with the truth.

1889
06:14:29,049 --> 06:14:38,090
The truth. No money exchanged. No rules or guidelines of what can you say about this or that.

1890
06:14:38,090 --> 06:14:51,259
No, just the truth. Hash House or GoGo at the link. Just the truth. Best. Best ever. Best in the world.

1891
06:14:51,419 --> 06:15:00,299
Best in the world. You need to spread the word of it. I do because I sat there for the first time

1892
06:15:01,259 --> 06:15:07,290
and I took one bite and I said, oh my god, this is the best food I've ever had in my whole life.

1893
06:15:08,169 --> 06:15:14,119
I have to tell everybody. People have to know if they come here, they can do this too.

1894
06:15:15,779 --> 06:15:22,520
Truth. When you go to Hash House or GoGo and you get that blue cheeseburger,

1895
06:15:24,470 --> 06:15:29,770
tell them that you came there on your own because they're not going to give a shit that I said to

1896
06:15:29,770 --> 06:15:44,090
go there. Hey, I want the blue cheeseburger. Okay. And by the way, German985 sent me.

1897
06:15:46,310 --> 06:15:53,450
I don't know who the fuck that is. Oh. The blue cheeseburger? Yeah, yeah, that's what

1898
06:15:53,450 --> 06:16:08,060
they are. All right. See you in a minute. You've made this joke. My cover. I'll blow my cover.

1899
06:16:08,060 --> 06:16:16,020
There are people here weeks ago or three years ago. There are a lot of new viewers.

1900
06:16:16,020 --> 06:16:29,259
Lots of them. Do not blow my cover. About that, he's trying to make people aware.

1901
06:16:30,599 --> 06:16:35,799
Thank you. Fucking weird Bernie Sanders, Larry David thing in my head that came out of there.

1902
06:16:35,799 --> 06:16:48,840
I appreciate that. And they need to know that people do need to be told. What happened? Oh,

1903
06:16:48,840 --> 06:16:53,240
Holly. Holly, thanks for the three dollars. The best restaurant in Vegas is the Omelette House.

1904
06:16:53,240 --> 06:17:02,650
Fight me. Omelette House. Don't get angry. I know you're going to get angry. Just slow down.

1905
06:17:03,209 --> 06:17:10,680
Hi. So, Omelette House. Yeah, you think that is? Don't do anything quick, but slowly. Back away

1906
06:17:10,680 --> 06:17:20,340
from your computer. Back away. It's Omelette House word. I need you to recite these words coming out

1907
06:17:20,340 --> 06:17:29,740
here for the next two seconds. I need you to say, I respect. I respect. Your opinion. Your opinion.

1908
06:17:30,540 --> 06:17:39,259
But. But. I happen to think. I happen to think. Hash House of Gogo at the link. Hash House of

1909
06:17:39,259 --> 06:17:46,060
Gogo at the link. Sucks. Because the restaurant sucks. Sucks. Because, wait. Wait, what happened?

1910
06:17:51,700 --> 06:17:56,340
No. Bring the prompting back down. Hash House of Gogo is a good restaurant. Omelette House is

1911
06:17:56,340 --> 06:18:03,220
all right, I guess. Thanks for the sub. Thanks for the sub. The best restaurant in Vegas is Hash

1912
06:18:03,220 --> 06:18:10,569
House of Gogo. Easy Measy, thanks for the $5. Yo, Jerma, missed the stream, but I've been watching

1913
06:18:10,569 --> 06:18:18,939
you since TF2. Hey, welcome back. A funniest, weirdest, and most humble streamer I've ever seen.

1914
06:18:19,979 --> 06:18:30,380
Never change, big man. Oh, man. I had no plan on it. Thanks for being around since TF2.

1915
06:18:31,020 --> 06:18:37,669
A long fucking time ago. Hey, Jerma's left foot, thanks for $3. Will one of those 30 cameras be

1916
06:18:37,669 --> 06:18:43,290
pointed at your feet? No. And if they do, I'm going to wear three pairs of shoes.

1917
06:18:45,880 --> 06:18:50,599
Thanks for the $3. Hey, an anonymous gifter, thanks for the five community subs. And Jizu,

1918
06:18:51,400 --> 06:18:57,180
five community subs as well. Thank you, both of you. And then finally,

1919
06:18:57,740 --> 06:19:05,529
I didn't even run the fucking credits. Yes, I did. You did. I was there. I did? Yeah, I did.

1920
06:19:05,529 --> 06:19:12,549
But you did? Yeah, because you didn't do it. You're too busy talking about, whatever, drugs.

1921
06:19:12,549 --> 06:19:18,659
Oh, well, thanks for doing that. Appreciate it. Anytime. We're going to bed now.

1922
06:19:18,659 --> 06:19:24,150
All right. Good night. Good night. See you tomorrow? I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

1923
06:19:24,950 --> 06:19:36,470
Okay. See you when you come back. Probably next week. Okay. Good night. Who am I talking to?

1924
06:19:39,049 --> 06:19:43,130
My mom was texting me, so I had to call her back. Saying good night to my mom.

1925
06:19:44,389 --> 06:19:53,400
Jerma lied about Morrowind, thanks for $2.50. Hi again. Jerma lied about Morrowind multiplayer.

1926
06:19:53,400 --> 06:20:00,389
Yes, I did. That was a lie. That was a full lie. Not even a jokey lie. That was just a lie.

1927
06:20:01,110 --> 06:20:11,209
See you on Wednesday. Have a great rest of your night. I would say have a great rest of your

1928
06:20:11,209 --> 06:20:19,189
weekend, but it's over. Have a good start to your week. We'll see you midweek for more drugs.

1929
06:20:19,750 --> 06:20:27,060
Sounds weird to say that, but then that rest of that week is going to be weird.

1930
06:20:27,060 --> 06:20:57,159
Good night. Goodbye. See you real soon. Take care.
