1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:12,810
Jerma, why? Why is Pog not enabled? I want to be able to Pog. I know. I'm not supposed to be here.

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,500
It's been 50 seconds. We're gonna, no, we're gonna let the intro play for a little bit and I'll be

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:01:02,140
right back. Pog, I'll be right back. I'll never have a real intro. I mean, this is, uh, hold on.

4
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:20,920
I mean, this is a real intro, but I have to go. I have, I'm just here. Yogi Bear for Jerma Rumble.

5
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:35,269
Why? Why do you want Yogi Bear? Oh, I forgot to change after last night. I forgot to change

6
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,950
the, I forgot to change the threshold for hype trains. I turned off the computer before doing

7
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:56,549
it and I turned it off. Hype Train! Okay, you guys have? Oh, you know, I fucked it up.

8
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:09,099
I forgot to change it. That's my bad. But thanks everybody for another hype train. Hype. Hype. Hype.

9
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:18,650
Hype. EU friendly. Yeah, that's right. Today and tomorrow. These streams are going to be shorter,

10
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:26,060
but they're going to be earlier the next couple of days. Today and then tomorrow. Community content

11
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:36,710
day is tomorrow. And because it's been so long, because the, I had a plan, like, you know, I was

12
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:42,710
going to go into the green screen again. So I delayed the last one from December because

13
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:52,180
there's probably a shitload of content. I might break it up into two days. Not that far apart,

14
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,960
obviously, but tomorrow we'll maybe we'll do part one and then maybe the weekend, the weekend after

15
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,580
do part two is because I don't want to have a problem. Here's what I don't want to have happen.

16
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,860
I don't want it to become like we're stuffing everything into one stream and I'm just skipping

17
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,139
over content and trying to go as fast as I can because it's going to be like a seven and a half

18
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:22,300
hour stream. You know what I'm saying? I'd rather like give time to people's work rather than quickly

19
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,060
just, all right, that was that one. That was that one. That was that one. There's 7,000 pieces of

20
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,580
artwork and go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Thanks a lot. That was fun. What do you mean? What voice?

21
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:42,090
What's wrong with my voice? What? Oh, my bit rate just dropped though. Okay. Is that your voice?

22
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:57,129
My bit rate just tanked. Did it just fuck everything up? Wait, hold on. It shouldn't be.

23
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:04,330
It should be normal. It should be normal. Do I have a thing on? Hold on. Hello. No, this is,

24
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:11,060
it should be, does this sound normal? It shouldn't. I wonder why that's happening. Hold on. That's weird.

25
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:29,779
Oh, that's weird. Hold on. Testing, testing again, testing again. This, this, this is, this does

26
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:39,689
sound different than I can't tell. Scam, scam level four incoming. Scam level four. You sound

27
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:46,569
like a robot. Do I have a, what's, yeah, this is weird. Hello. Hello. Oh, my fucking God didn't

28
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:51,370
mean to do that. I think it's because I have this plugged into here. Okay. Let me know if this fixes

29
00:04:51,370 --> 00:05:17,449
it. Okay. I accidentally ripped out the power cord. I ripped out the power cable. Hold on a second.

30
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:26,490
Is this any better? That didn't, I didn't change anything from yesterday. Did it get, did it,

31
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:37,670
is it actually fixed? Huh. That's weird. I wonder why that happened. That's odd. Uh, okay. Sorry

32
00:05:37,670 --> 00:06:11,160
about that. I don't know why that happened, but give me one second. Oh, I lost audio somehow. Hold

33
00:06:11,160 --> 00:07:12,120
on. Okay. How does it sound now? Do I, is it still like messed up and crackly? I don't know why this

34
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:25,160
happened. Sounds okay. Well, hopefully I can hear this. Okay, I can. Hey, listen to that.

35
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:37,769
Okay, I'm ready to go. Everything's fixed. Everything's good. Some of you might be familiar

36
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:42,490
with that music. By the way, thanks for the hype train, everybody. But as I finish the, uh,

37
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:49,529
the intro here, uh, yeah, tonight, today we're going to do, we're going to go for about four or five

38
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:56,490
hours tomorrow. Maybe like four, three, four, five or something like that under, under four, under five.

39
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:18,579
Be you friendly. All right. Here we go. Oh, there it is. Hold on. It's a little stretchy,

40
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:29,589
a little stretchy. Hey, it's okay. It can be a little stretchy. This game's a banger. That's

41
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:37,399
what it is. Make the volume quiet. I don't think I want to make the volume quiet on a

42
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:44,539
music game. Hey, can you like turn down the music in this music game? All right, let's go.

43
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:59,019
We got to level five. No way. No way. Scam complete.

44
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:11,019
Scam level five. We're at scam level five. How would you like to label your save file?

45
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:26,070
Uh, grandma. Yes, I can't wait. I'm looking forward to this. Welcome. We hope you'll enjoy

46
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:36,179
Rhythm Heaven Fever. The game is both fun and very simple to play. You just press the buttons to a

47
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:42,309
rhythm. The key is being able to keep that rhythm going. I, you know, you guys know me, I'm fucking

48
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:53,690
good. Space channel five. Done. Space channel bootleg edition. Done. Uh, guitar, uh, guitar hero,

49
00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:13,500
guitar hero, guitar-o-man. Done. Ten subs. No, no, no, we don't have ten subs. Hey guys,

50
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,580
we just crossed ten subs. You are quiet. I know because I turned myself down because I want you

51
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:29,049
to hear the fucking tunes. All right, how do we do this? A. Are you ready to start the rhythm

52
00:10:29,049 --> 00:11:00,700
test? Press A in time with the signal. Not bad. Not bad. I just, what did I just do? I just made a

53
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,470
stock market. If you have a lot of marks above the center line, it means you're pressing the

54
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:18,809
button too early. Hold on, I almost tangled up. Quick sell. Sell at the top. Try waiting a little

55
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:24,220
longer. All right, hold on. Do it again. Did I fail the tutorial? If most of your marks fail below

56
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:31,700
the center line, that means your timing is a little late. I pray. Do I go a little quicker?

57
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:45,690
Let's move on to our other rhythm test. Press A when the timer hits zero. On zero. Okay, yep.

58
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:50,730
People do this differently. When there's no, wait, when there's no sound, try counting to

59
00:11:50,730 --> 00:12:18,460
yourself. Okay. Three. All right, can I get the minor prize or the major prize? Oh shit. Okay.

60
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:03,399
Six, five, three, two, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero, seven, six, five, four,

61
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:14,840
three, two, one, zero, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. Done? All right. Some of them

62
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:28,940
were not great. I like this so-called human music. If all your marks are close to the center line,

63
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,750
that means you're good at maintaining the rhythm. I was. It was one that was wrong because I didn't

64
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:45,990
realize it was changing up on me midway. Go you. That's it for the rhythm test. Hey, ladies and

65
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,830
gentlemen, I want to make sure this is real clear. We just crossed a level five hike train.

66
00:13:52,950 --> 00:14:02,070
If you could please all scream Pog at the same time. Show us how excited you are. I feel like

67
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:08,779
I'm running an infomercial. I'm the guy directing the infomercial with the audience. Okay guys. And

68
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:14,700
when Ron Papile comes out, I want to make sure that you guys go nuts for him. Even though none

69
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,340
of you have probably even heard his name before in your whole lives. Act like it's your savior.

70
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:31,980
If we get in three, two, one, make it happen. Here he comes. Ron Papile. No, thanks a lot guys.

71
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:40,970
It's a lot of fucking money. A lot. And it happens every day. So thanks. That's fucking crazy. It's

72
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,370
not important how well you did in the test. As long as you have fun, that's the main thing. That's

73
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:52,149
exactly how I feel. So I'm, I'm, this, me and this game are going to quit. We've got quite a few

74
00:14:52,149 --> 00:15:00,899
games in store for you. We hope you'll like improving your rhythm with them all. One more

75
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:08,279
thing. In the test just now, you only had to press A. But some of the other games are a bit trickier.

76
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:19,820
Sometimes you need to press A and B at the same time. Give it a try. Just squished his head.

77
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:26,919
Yep. Just like that. Remember what that feels like. You'll need it later. All right. We won't

78
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:39,500
keep you any longer. Go have fun. I'm excited. Level one. Golf. Call in one. You know what will

79
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:49,620
really improve your golf game? Climbing your swings to music. All right. Call in one.

80
00:15:52,710 --> 00:16:01,049
Can we get a WarioWare intro to everything? Hi. Call me Monkey. Welcome to the first rhythm game.

81
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:06,309
Call in one. In this game, you'll just press A to hit the ball as it flies toward you.

82
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:13,879
Easy, right? But you'll see that the timing is tricky part. Let me show you what I mean. Give

83
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:34,679
it a try. Here it comes. Wait for it. Wait. Did I just do it? Nice job. All right. I get it.

84
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,549
It actually looks like him. Let's try with some rhythm.

85
00:16:53,509 --> 00:17:11,299
This is fun. This is going to be hard. So how was that? Much easier than before, right? Well,

86
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,670
hello. It's my friend, Mandrill. He's a mandrill. Can I play too?

87
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:35,900
What? He's just throwing fucking balls at me. You can't do it like that, Mandrill.

88
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,299
It's hard to hit the ball if you just fling it with no warning. Yes, it is.

89
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:48,859
You have to give a cue or something. All right. Yeah. Sorry about that. I forgot. It's your first

90
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:56,759
time playing. This time, I'll give you a good cue. Let's try again. There. Yeah. Let's try it

91
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:26,200
again. This time, Mandrill will make a noise as he throws the ball. Okay. Nice. Good. You're

92
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:34,519
getting the fast balls too. Can you feel it? No, don't do it. Please don't do it. No, I have to.

93
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:38,359
Don't do it. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. It's not worth it.

94
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:50,119
I feel it too. God damn it. Whatever. Can you feel it? Are you riding the rhythm? Feels good,

95
00:18:50,119 --> 00:19:05,079
huh? All right. Let's review. So, Mandrill and I will switch off and toss balls at you. Okay.

96
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:28,099
Best game ever. This is the best game ever. This might be the best game ever made.

97
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:44,299
Close. No, Jerma. Okay. Now, let's do the real thing. All right. I'm ready. This is the real

98
00:19:44,299 --> 00:21:05,160
thing. Hold on. Oh, I wasn't ready for that. My God. It's one. Damn it. I apparently... No,

99
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,640
that's right. Okay. I'm waiting for... It's a fast ball. I get it. I get it. I get it. It's a fast

100
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:34,359
ball. So, I get it. Figured it out. Simeon feedback. The monkey was very impressed and

101
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:40,039
your mandrill friend says he did well. You got us. Superb. Hey, even if you get some rocks thrown

102
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:44,359
at you, you're fine. Even if you get a couple of rocks thrown at you... I mean, somebody can

103
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:51,849
throw a rock up there. What's the rock music? Somebody threw a rock at me. Championship title,

104
00:21:51,849 --> 00:22:03,849
here we come. What was that? I just did... I've said that like seven times in like six different

105
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:11,339
videos and like five different screens. I just gave you kind of all of them. I say that all the

106
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:14,779
time. I was just pulling out the ones that you've probably heard before from some of your favorite

107
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:19,930
videos. If you're new to the channel, then you don't have any favorite videos.

108
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:37,029
What? You don't have a favorite video of mine? Fake, fake fans. No, there's no such thing as a

109
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:43,049
fake fan. The cafe is now open. The barista is quite friendly and is waiting to meet you.

110
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:56,009
What's this one? Screwbox factory and cafe. You're encouraging copy power. Let's go to the cafe.

111
00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:02,819
Let's go to the cafe. Welcome to the cafe. Is this your first time here? Feel free to stop by

112
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:09,180
anytime you find the games too hard or you just want to take a break. If there's anything I can

113
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,500
do to help, well, that's what I'm here for. I'm a little busy right now since I only just opened for

114
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:22,970
the day, but we'll talk more later. I'm back soon. Read something. Rhythm test. You can do rhythm.

115
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:47,849
Hold on. Microphone's in a stupid place. Give me a second. Anybody got a pair of pliers I can borrow?

116
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:54,099
I need a pair of pliers. I talked to the barista. I've got some other customers to help. We'll talk

117
00:23:54,099 --> 00:24:15,849
later. Okay. A pair of pliers so I can tighten my microphone stand. Listen to music. I only have

118
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:26,329
one song unlocked. Okay, yeah. This place looks packed. I don't need to take a break. Let's go.

119
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:34,470
Screwbot Factory. Robot assembly is a precise task. I've heard this song before.

120
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:42,250
Where's this from? Is this in anything else? Is this only in this game? I've heard this.

121
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,539
You'll need to tighten the final screw just the right amount.

122
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:55,859
Have I played this before? Have I played this? I think I've played this.

123
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:02,299
No, I haven't. Have I? Welcome to the factory floor. This is where the magic happens. Or maybe

124
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:10,730
it's in Smash Brothers. Okay, are there any of these songs in Smash Brothers? I feel like they

125
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:18,380
would be, right? Your job will be to screw the robot's heads on. Hold A and B until the head is

126
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:44,519
screwed on. I have to do it too. Please assemble these smaller robots too. Okay, that's kind of

127
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:55,579
off beat though. Wait, did I say let's go because he said let's go? Probably. My brain, I'm so easily

128
00:25:55,579 --> 00:26:03,339
manipulatable. I'm the most easily manipulatable person you've ever met in your life. That's why

129
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:10,549
the one guy exists. You can inception ideas in me and I don't even have to be asleep.

130
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:14,920
In fact, it would be harder if I was asleep. Of course it would because I would be asleep.

131
00:26:14,920 --> 00:27:47,700
Movies aren't real. Okay, here we go. Two. Great. Movies are real. Yes. It's perfect if I've ever

132
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:55,240
seen one in my whole life. You finished the great robots well in the white robots cast inspection.

133
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:06,740
You got a superb. Is that a perfect? Wow, that's a perfect. Did I get? No, I didn't.

134
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:15,339
Let's go. I thought that said let's go. Perfect world. It's like, yeah, I got a perfect. I got

135
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:21,740
scammed. Well, that means I didn't. No, there it is, right? No, it's a gold medal. You unlocked

136
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:33,640
rhythm toys. Collect medals to play with more toys. Rhythm toys. Toy car? Police call. All right,

137
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,980
what's toy car? Oh shit, my battery, my Wiimote 12. All right, more batteries.

138
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:51,700
But don't worry because Wiimotes and the Wii is old technology and sometimes old technology

139
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,819
is better than new technology because I don't have to plug this in to an outlet with like a

140
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:02,740
mini USB cable. It's two AA batteries. Sometimes old technology is better than new technology.

141
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:21,059
Pull back. Let's go. Let go. What could be simpler? The A to start the right time to let go.

142
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:44,329
Too far. I don't get it. Right. Is that not correct? Oh shit. I missed it.

143
00:29:45,609 --> 00:30:12,579
So wait, it's. Yep. Wait, this mini game sucks. A little farther. Dizzy bird.

144
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:57,579
Oh, it's dizzy bird. It's just car bird. Boom. Oh, okay. Come on. Oh, it's perfect. That was exact.

145
00:30:57,579 --> 00:31:08,390
That's as no one has ever gotten that before, but except for me. What can I just do it?

146
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:22,339
Is it twice in a row? No one's ever done it twice in a row. How do I get out of here?

147
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:38,980
Oh shit, it gets faster. Oh, okay. Hold on. I'm just going to make noises this whole street.

148
00:31:41,130 --> 00:32:03,130
There it is. Really? I think that's late. Does this do it? Does this do anything for me?

149
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:16,250
It's a toy. Okay. How do I leave? That was fun. Need seven medals for police car.

150
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:29,509
Is he enough? Let's go. We go. This one is called Seesaw. Yeah, this like.

151
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:38,460
It's definitely like Smash Brothers Brawl or something. Seesaw inspectors are here

152
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,019
doing important work to ensure the safety of our children. Serious business, you know,

153
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:57,619
no shenanigans. He played this game in an old YouTube video. No, I didn't though.

154
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:04,619
This is all new to me. Welcome to playground safety. We're going to inspect this Seesaw.

155
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:11,400
At the moment you land, press A. Which one am I? I'm just kidding.

156
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:26,740
Looking good. Okay. Is it that simple? We'll be checking the inner part too.

157
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:48,279
You won't go as high here, so it goes a little faster. All right. Great. No problems with the

158
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:57,220
inner part. Now we'll keep checking though. You can never be too safe. There you go. I'm going

159
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:56,889
to like this song. This is going to be my favorite song. I'm a little late. The guy going

160
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:35,980
too high, too high. Oh, they're doing the air guitar. That's odd. They're both dead. Okay.

161
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:41,909
That's kind of sad. Kind of morbid. They both die at the end. Oh, those are some happy landings.

162
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:52,980
And your high jumps were impressive. You got a medal. That's a good Seesaw. A good Seesaw.

163
00:35:52,980 --> 00:36:02,699
And new toys. You unlocked endless games. See how far you can get. Oh, I don't think that's a

164
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:13,219
good idea to do that right now. That's a bad idea to click this. You know what I mean? Mr. Upbeat.

165
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:33,369
Okay. Mr. Upbeat. Personal record. What do I do? Hop over the needle. Was that a needle? Oh,

166
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:57,699
okay. Wait. So wait, hold on. For a second I thought, oh, that was it. No, this goes on forever.

167
00:36:57,699 --> 00:38:06,280
This goes on for actually forever. Does it speed up? Infinite content. This is going to go faster

168
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:41,059
and faster. Can I get to 100? Let's see. Hey! Ah! I fucked it up. Whatever. I don't care. Double

169
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:48,840
date. It's your first date with the girl of your dreams. Also, some weasels are on a date. Don't

170
00:38:48,840 --> 00:39:04,940
let the double date be ruined by flying balls. Sucker, you talk. Double date. Hey, you. Yeah.

171
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:12,579
You, the human. Oh, listen. I have a date coming up soon. And I have a huge favor to ask you.

172
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:49,480
If a stray ball comes your way, can you kick it? A kick. That wasn't so bad. Perfect.

173
00:39:50,119 --> 00:40:04,860
Just like that. Uh oh. I see a basketball coming. I hear a car coming. I get it. Yep.

174
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:23,159
That was a little early. You guys thought I was lying to you when I said that I used to. I'm

175
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:31,320
serious. If there's a drum set somewhere and I'm there and you're there and it's open drum night,

176
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:38,219
I want you to hold me to this. I want you to say, Jeremy, go fucking prove it. That you used to,

177
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:43,579
you know how to play the drums. And I'll be like, is that okay? And I want like a written

178
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:49,340
permission from the establishment that I can do it. I know how to play the drums. I know half beats.

179
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:54,300
I know side beats. I know quarter beats. I know tenth beats, tenths of a beats. You know what I

180
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:07,900
mean? I know them all. I know every beat. Yikes! A football! Oh, I thought it was me. Wait, wait,

181
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:33,590
what's the time in here? Okay. And then I see it's done. Yeah, it's on the third. I could do it. I

182
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:40,949
just don't feel like it right now. I didn't say that. I said, thanks. I love you. Thanks. I love

183
00:41:40,949 --> 00:42:30,730
you. Well, I love you too, Mr. Beaver. All right. See you later. Yes. Trying to ruin this date.

184
00:42:31,690 --> 00:43:43,159
Yeah, somebody's intentionally doing this. Give me a purpose. Oops. Oops. Oops. I got it. I just

185
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:53,420
died to that. That was, I put my foot. What? Okay. Slow down. I just wanted to show you that I could

186
00:43:53,420 --> 00:44:08,739
kick. Oh, it's okay. It's all right. It's okay. Don't worry about it. It's all right. Superb.

187
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:15,559
It's like you were born to kick. Footballs are clearly no problem for you. Also, did you really,

188
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:20,199
you did really well at the hard parts. Hey, thanks. Video games that I'm friendly. I've been

189
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:39,130
waiting to want to tell you. Tell me what? That was just Monka S, right? That was an actual Monka S.

190
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:48,309
This game automatically saved, by the way. Remix. Wait, I didn't unlock this one. How did I not

191
00:44:48,309 --> 00:45:04,380
unlock this? I didn't get it. Usually you unlock the one next to it. All right. Remix one. Battery

192
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,940
is low. I know. I'm going to, I'm going to have to take a minute. I'm not having this dude turn

193
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,579
off in the middle of the game. Let's mix things up. This one's got a tropical vibe, like a musical

194
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:19,739
vacation. There's no practice on this one. Sorry, buddy. That's what I thought it said. Sorry, buddy.

195
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:34,409
You know, if I had, if I could set up this GoXLR to do like the remix, I would do it. I don't know

196
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:39,960
how, and I'm probably never going to learn. Hello. This is where we mix up everything you've done

197
00:45:39,960 --> 00:46:28,059
so far. It's easier if you just relax into the rhythm. Have fun. Oh, that was faster.

198
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:46,579
Oh man. Okay. Okay. Okay. Second date ain't going so well. Okay. She's, she's seeing through the

199
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:56,699
veil of bullshit that I hit last time. Oh, she just, she just heard about my political views.

200
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:17,190
It's all right. Kick the basketball back. I can do it. Yeah. Good enough. Let me do that one again.

201
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:22,150
I know that that one just let me do that one again. Come on. That's the first time I've had

202
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:29,050
an issue with the game so far. Your performance was like a tasty slice of cake. I can do, I can

203
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:35,900
get gold medal on that one. Do it again. Holy shit. Okay. Remix one, do it again. I know I'll do,

204
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:43,019
I'll deal the battery later. Save the date this time. I'm going to try and then I'm going to

205
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:50,500
replace the batteries in my Wiimote controller. We're going to keep going. You already heard.

206
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:58,650
All right. Let's go. That's my sub sound from like 2016.

207
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:21,820
There it is. Okay. That's a superb.

208
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:55,590
Your performance was like a fine Thanksgiving dinner cake. This one's called Forklifter. I know

209
00:49:55,590 --> 00:50:00,250
the battery's low. I'm too addicted to it. I can't stop. Battery. I know battery. After this one.

210
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:08,329
Do not let me scream until I can do it. I want you guys after this to spam the word battery.

211
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:13,780
Just say batteries, batteries, batteries, batteries, or riot and just riot until I,

212
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,900
because it's going to happen. I'm going to, it's going to die in the middle of the game

213
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,739
and I'm going to go. I should have done something about that. I should have done something about

214
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:35,849
that. Why did I do nothing about this? Forklift. Dinner time. Pity the food is so far away.

215
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:48,179
Press A to grab the food as it zooms by. Let's try it first with some cues. You don't do one,

216
00:50:48,179 --> 00:51:02,579
two, go. One, two, three, go. One, two, go. That's not universal. Now let's try it without the cues.

217
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:33,780
Very good. Let's try changing up the timing. Pretty good cat puke sound. I like it. Bon

218
00:51:33,780 --> 00:53:12,440
appétit. Let's try. I can't get sweaty. I can't talk at all. This takes literal 100% of my brain.

219
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:20,440
I can't speak. I can't talk. I, all I can do is just stare at the screen blankly and press the

220
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:27,349
button. What are you guys saying? What are you guys saying? So full, so satisfied. Battery. I

221
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:33,460
don't understand. I don't get it. Battery. That was one of the batteries. All right. I told you

222
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:41,369
that. All right. Let's go. Give me a second. You unlock two player mode. Oh, what? I don't have two

223
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:46,469
remotes. All right. All right. Battery. Battery. Battery. Battery. Battery. Battery. Battery.

224
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:54,489
Okay. Give me a second. All right. This is going to take a minute. Hold on. I need to go get

225
00:53:54,489 --> 00:53:58,650
batteries. All right. Just take, it's been like an hour. Take a break. Go pee. I'll be right back.

226
00:53:58,650 --> 00:57:31,050
It's been like two minutes. Right back. He's close. I can feel it. He's close. Sorry. Take care of

227
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:53,400
Otto. Just a good dog. The monkey watch level is going to break him. Is it though? Yo, Otto. He's

228
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,880
not in a, he's not doing well. He's slow and he just had a procedure and I don't want to show his

229
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:34,780
cuts, you know, his wound on his. Come here. Kim, uh, me and Kim have been switching off,

230
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,550
uh, taking care of him. He's fine. I mean, it's been like three or four days,

231
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:46,230
but he needs to be, you know, in the same room with you. Supervise him. Make sure he's,

232
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:54,409
you know, doing okay. What did he have? He had some growths that they removed from his legs.

233
00:58:55,369 --> 00:59:02,809
He had a couple of under the skin, uh, growths. So they wanted just to just take him out and

234
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:06,650
just check them just to make sure everything's fine. You know, just want to make sure my dog's

235
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:19,449
good to go. But let's go. I didn't even put the batteries in. I didn't even put in the

236
00:59:19,449 --> 01:00:09,219
fucking batteries. It's like what? Hold on. Okay. I'm back for real this time. Like actually for

237
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:23,059
real this time. I promise. Let me just get this going and connect. Monkey watch level is going to

238
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:57,349
break him. Will it though? Come on. Come on. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

239
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:17,559
wait, wait. There we go. There we go. Come on. Wait, batteries are in the wrong way. No,

240
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:25,539
I fucked it up. All right, let's go. Uh, actually, uh, Kim just got back and she just got auto and

241
01:01:25,539 --> 01:01:31,800
now he's being taken care of. So he's good to go. All right, let's do it. Remember if you're in a

242
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:37,880
room with, uh, remember if you're in a room with like three or four people, don't spin around like

243
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,280
a fucking helicopter and hit them on the table. Thanks, Nintendo. I'll make sure I won't do that.

244
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:53,579
Oh, you guys didn't see the warning. All right. There we go. Back in business. Full battery.

245
01:01:53,579 --> 01:02:00,760
I'm ready to get this going. This is called tambourine. Ready to play a little simian says

246
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:20,340
on the tambourine. Mouse cursor. Uh, is this monkey watch? Look, look, let's play tambourine

247
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,829
together. Okay. See what I do. Then coffee. I have to do this voice for everything.

248
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:40,579
Okay. I'll signal it when you raise your turn. How do I go?

249
01:02:46,949 --> 01:03:10,230
What? Oh, what's wrong with them? Okay. You got to count. Oh, you got it. As you were,

250
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:16,300
I now switch to English. You weren't speaking English, right? Tapping the tambourine with your

251
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:34,010
other hand now like this. Give it a try. Press A and B together. You got it. Now try copying me

252
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:45,190
in time to the rhythm. Hey, thanks to the five community subs. Oh, it's A and B, A and B, A and

253
01:03:45,190 --> 01:05:15,030
B. Sorry. Okay. Start the music. That's A and then A and B. Yeah. I don't remember. Do something.

254
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:26,340
Oh, you handled the basics well and oh, I like your clapping. I got a superb.

255
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:31,179
It's the memory. It's remembering the, it's the Simon says, I'm never gonna forget it. I got a

256
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:37,639
superb. It's because the notes that I did hit were so good that it made up for the ones that I missed.

257
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:50,179
Board meeting. You finally made it to the big office. If you want to impress the chairman,

258
01:05:50,179 --> 01:06:08,860
follow your assistance advice. Let's get this meeting underway. First, we'll rehearse our

259
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:42,039
presentation of plan A. Your chair will spin. Press A to stop on your turn. I get it. Wish

260
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:51,780
that were me. Which one? What are you talking about? God, I, what, what, what, what in, what

261
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:58,550
are you talking about? Why did I read that? Because I'm confused. I actually am confused.

262
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:27,449
What are you even talking about? Oh, right. So I feel like it's gonna be hard. What is

263
01:07:27,449 --> 01:07:32,760
this meeting? That's a great question. If you present to the board this well, you'll do great.

264
01:08:00,099 --> 01:08:18,810
Yeah. Worst episode of shark tank I've ever seen. Uh, guys, yeah, I have, uh,

265
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:30,260
a new tablecloth. That was fast. Your presentation of plan A was a hit and the

266
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:40,899
board really liked plan B. Congratulations, Mr. Chairman. Why is everything on fire?

267
01:08:41,539 --> 01:08:56,899
That's really, that was kind of odd. Everything's on fire. Fire. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. This is the thing

268
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:03,739
people were warning me about. Monkey watch. This new watch works differently from most. You might

269
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:19,720
want to read the manual to learn how to use it. Monka Omega Low from the monkey watch manual.

270
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:31,539
The monkeys high five to show the time. Press A when the second hand passes a friend.

271
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:54,100
It's not so bad. The monkey watch manual. Some monkeys are on the off beats, right? One, two,

272
01:09:54,100 --> 01:10:18,920
one, two, three, four. I got, I get it. Hey, it's then I get it.

273
01:10:24,539 --> 01:12:10,260
Going on. It kept time really well. I thought it was going to be in the dark.

274
01:12:10,899 --> 01:12:18,279
Superb. That wasn't so bad. This is without a doubt, the cutest watch I've ever owned.

275
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,100
But everyone was like, dude, monkey watch is, he's, it's going to fuck him up. He's going to

276
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:46,500
freak out. That wasn't so bad. You were supposed to fail. Did they increase in difficulty? I'm

277
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:55,850
sure they do. All right, here we go. Mix it up. They do. All right. Well, whatever. Let's go.

278
01:12:55,850 --> 01:13:25,210
Let's, that's fine. I'm into it. No practice. That's how you're going to get this stream.

279
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:58,859
I don't remember. Okay. That was, that was a little rough. It's all right. I,

280
01:13:58,859 --> 01:14:01,979
let me get superb on this one. That could have been better. I'll do it again.

281
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:14,229
That was a fail. It was, you played like a first level unhatched egg. That is such,

282
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:27,899
that's such a, yeah. That, what, what an insult. A level one unhatched egg. If you get a perfect

283
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:37,770
on seesaw right now, you'll receive a gift called partners right now. It is a limited time only

284
01:14:38,409 --> 01:14:51,699
limited time. I get it. Welcome to playground safety. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I already know I've

285
01:14:51,699 --> 01:16:38,489
skipped practice. I don't do this. Let's go. Perfect. Get the fuck out of here. Nice commentary. If I

286
01:16:38,489 --> 01:16:43,050
had said a single word, I would have fucked up partners. You've earned a gift. Read it at the

287
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:50,359
cafe. There are still 49 gifts left to get. Keep going at the cafe. Let's go look at it.

288
01:16:51,399 --> 01:17:00,199
This is such a cute little game. It really is. This is so, this is so fun. How have I never played

289
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:15,380
this before? What's wrong with me? Do I not even know what a good game actually is? Oh, it's down

290
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:39,899
here. Okay. Okay. Talk later. Uh, read something. Partners C. Hey saw what's up C. How many

291
01:17:39,899 --> 01:17:46,710
years have we been working together? See, uh, it was two years before I got married. Uh, that's

292
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:58,550
10 years. That's long already. Time really does fly. Just think 10 years of eat on bap boom.

293
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:06,779
Oh, I'm amazed that I'm still not sick of it. Seems like I've been falling on my rump more and

294
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:13,239
more lately. Sorry about that C. Hey, I've been the one falling onto my head for those handstand

295
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:19,699
jumps. I'm the one who should be apologizing. So no, no, no, no. I fall off my bum way more.

296
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:29,189
I'm sorry, but my head smashes away. Creepy. I'm so sorry. Hey, uh, how is your neck anyway?

297
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:34,329
Ah, it's okay. Uh, how about you? So your bum's not sore or anything.

298
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:41,100
Nah, thanks though. Let's say the kids will be showing up to play at the park pretty soon.

299
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:48,760
We better get to work then. Keeping them off this unsafe seesaw. What's the point of that?

300
01:18:54,329 --> 01:19:01,800
What's the point of that? Let's just lower. Okay. Oh, that was cool. All right, let's go.

301
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,460
Remix two.

302
01:19:35,819 --> 01:19:38,779
Do I really got to do this?

303
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:10,420
That was not, no, I saw somebody said it was thank you for buying the game.

304
01:20:11,619 --> 01:20:26,630
I own all this shit. All right. Now I'm okay. You know, you got me all twisted pressing me out.

305
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:33,430
I, I'm sorry. I didn't just have to, I'm sorry. But I'm having trouble.

306
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,680
I fucking lost the time and already it's din, din, din. Is there a retry button?

307
01:20:53,369 --> 01:21:52,810
He didn't take his medicine today. Chop up. Okay. Chop up my head. It's okay. I got it.

308
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:57,899
That's good. That's good enough. That's good enough. That's good enough for them.

309
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:06,859
League notes. That was great. Really great. Good job. Superb. You got a medal. He played like a

310
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:15,340
12th level golden rooster. That's not a very good Hearthstone rank. I'm not that satisfied

311
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:35,479
with that one. Working dough. Time to get to work. Follow your coworkers lead and move those

312
01:22:35,479 --> 01:22:37,960
thingies. Look at those thingies.

313
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:48,260
Working dough. Somebody just gave a fucking, hold on.

314
01:22:51,430 --> 01:23:08,329
Zyxia or Zyx, Zyx, Zyx, Zyxa. Just gave 50 community subs. 50, 50, 50. That's huge.

315
01:23:08,329 --> 01:23:11,210
That's a lot of money. That's a ridiculous amount of subs to give.

316
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:36,810
Oh my god. My fucking lord. Thank you so much, Zyxia. Am I saying your name wrong?

317
01:23:37,449 --> 01:23:59,220
Tell me if I am. Pog, dude. Zyckia? It's probably Zycia. Zyckia. Zyckia? Is it? Well, anyways,

318
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:04,180
that's a fucking ton of money. Thank you for the 50 community subs. Keep with us over 10k.

319
01:24:04,819 --> 01:24:10,869
We're still over 10k. Unfucking believable. Thank you.

320
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:20,020
He doesn't know Pepe left. What do I not know? Press A to jump and help me transport the thingies.

321
01:24:20,899 --> 01:24:46,340
Just watch and copy what I do. I love that clap. Top 40. Yeah, this community has exploded in the

322
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:56,789
last year and a half. So I hope that I can keep up. You know what I mean? I'm just going to keep

323
01:24:56,789 --> 01:25:03,020
doing what I've been doing for years and that I'm not going to change much. You know, I don't want

324
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:06,220
to be like, wait a minute. Hold on. This is a fucking lot more people here. This is a ton of

325
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:10,380
money. I got to do something. I got to change. I got to do something different. I'm just going

326
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:15,350
to keep doing it. You know what I'm saying? Good. Just keep sucking at games. I just got perfect on

327
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:21,430
first try on the fucking, on the seesaw. So the person that said that, I want you to mod that

328
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:28,409
person for a week so they think, holy shit, I'm modded. And then after a week, IP ban them.

329
01:25:28,409 --> 01:25:38,729
You know what I'm saying? All right. Time for the heavy ones. A and B.

330
01:25:39,689 --> 01:25:58,859
This reminds me of an old flash game. That's it. You're a natural. All right. Work hard and keep

331
01:25:58,859 --> 01:26:52,979
your chin up. I don't like the red light. Kind of hurts my head. Commentary Jeremy. Oh, I can't

332
01:26:52,979 --> 01:28:07,640
launch it back up. It's hard to press A like that. Oh, here comes the boss. There it is. Oh God,

333
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:15,899
it's Reddit. What do you mean? Oh God, it's Reddit. Oh, Reddit. Okay. I see. It was the Reddit face.

334
01:28:15,899 --> 01:28:17,979
The Reddit mascot. What's the Reddit mascot's name?

335
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:25,720
Quirky. Don't tell me. I'll get it. I'm not going to look at chat. It's like quirky or something

336
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:43,239
or like quirk, quirk, quirko. It's something like that. It's like quirky. It's new. Is it really?

337
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:50,329
Oh, I thought snoo was, people have tried to get me to say the word snoo in messages and I just

338
01:28:50,329 --> 01:29:05,619
skip over it because I think it's something like that or something. Like, it doesn't,

339
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:19,750
but he actually said it. No, no, that's not right. Wait, what? Hold on. This is called built to scale.

340
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:26,409
We got them. Well, you got them. Oh, this one looks cool. Welcome to your new factory job.

341
01:29:27,289 --> 01:29:42,890
First, we move the widget parts into position. Move the widget using A. I like when it becomes

342
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:59,699
my turn. You know what I mean? What else is there? It's probably moved forward, backwards. Next,

343
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:06,500
we assemble the widget. I'm it with the other parts and press A and B. What do you mean?

344
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:35,020
Press A to move and A and B to assemble. That feels nice. Great. Just like that. Please build

345
01:30:35,020 --> 01:31:07,689
a lot of widgets. Okay. Cool. Yeah. I like to watch German on a spot. He's got a good screen.

346
01:31:07,689 --> 01:31:59,300
His screen goes slow and down. Fuck me up. I'm going to get real fast. I could do better than

347
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:12,439
that. The entire commentary, this whole screen has just been when you lose in a fighting game

348
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:17,960
and when you're at the screen where you lost and the opponent says three words,

349
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:36,140
that's his whole screen. Piece of cake. You've got nothing on me. God, try harder. That's all

350
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:47,590
you've heard. That wasn't so bad. Nothing like a job well done. That was four words. I love you.

351
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:55,739
I don't think I've ever played a fighting game where after you lose, the person goes,

352
01:32:56,300 --> 01:33:07,060
I love you. Air rally. Keep the rally going in this badminton game. Try not to let the birdie

353
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:20,039
go out of bounds though. I love when it makes like the sound. You know, there's one thing that people

354
01:33:20,039 --> 01:33:23,720
impress, you know, I impress a lot of people by going, they go, how the fuck did you do that?

355
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:33,350
I go, learn. You know what I like when I'm flying badminton? Let me show you. Hit that birdie back

356
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:56,729
to be with A. Illegal. That's a penalty for you. Good. That's it. I'm going to change up the rhythm

357
01:33:56,729 --> 01:34:25,819
now. Of course you will. Listen for my signal. It's going to be hard. Next, let's see how you

358
01:34:25,819 --> 01:34:58,010
do when I'm farther out. The beat stays the same. Nice. Now for the real thing. That's the same

359
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:03,770
timing. It just looks different. We got a little higher. One, two, one, two, three, four.

360
01:35:05,210 --> 01:36:15,020
Oh, you fuck. Stop counting. Stop counting. I just want to listen to the beat. Doing that.

361
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:20,010
When he counts. Start the whole thing over. I don't want, I don't want it to be counting.

362
01:36:20,729 --> 01:36:27,420
That's okay. So if I'm playing, if I'm doing a beat, if I'm like one, two, three, four, one,

363
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:31,579
two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Stop doing that. I'm trying to hold

364
01:36:31,579 --> 01:36:43,300
beat, man. Here we go. Two, three, four, two, three, four. It's like an old music instructor

365
01:36:43,300 --> 01:37:08,300
from the ninth grade. No, skip practice. I already know this. Fucking counting. Stop counting.

366
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:15,800
I can't do the counting. When I hear two, three, four, I freeze and I go, what's happening? Two,

367
01:37:15,800 --> 01:38:12,420
three, four? No. Is there a way to restart? Three, four. Undertale. Same scenario.

368
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:24,970
What the fuck? What the fuck? How many times have I done? What the fuck? I go, I go down to

369
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:34,890
my lowest form when I need to dedicate my entire brain power to something. If I was fixing a clock,

370
01:39:35,529 --> 01:39:39,770
if I had a watch and I had all the tools and I was really concentrating with the little gears,

371
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:47,220
that's the same way. If somebody came to talk to me, if they were like,

372
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:53,340
hey, Jeremy, what the fuck? That's all I would do. And then I would look back down and go back to

373
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:58,680
work. I wouldn't be able to talk to that person. If you change any variables at all, what I'm

374
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:02,680
concentrating, you get like a one word statement. And then I have to go back to what I was doing.

375
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:09,479
Play Undertale again. I did play Undertale. Why did I say Undertale? Because the music,

376
01:40:10,199 --> 01:40:26,310
it went like, it did that Undertale thing. Um, what do you mean? Listen, it goes,

377
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:45,619
watch, I'm getting question marks. I'll be quiet. Ready? Three, four, and

378
01:40:59,979 --> 01:41:07,399
crazy. All right. Figure fighter is the latest in toy boxer technology.

379
01:41:08,199 --> 01:41:14,250
Try him out in the ring for a few rounds. You'll be the tiny inflatable champ in no time.

380
01:41:15,289 --> 01:41:28,949
LOL, LUL, omega, LUL, omega low, super mega low. Hiya, I'm what you call a muscle doll.

381
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:35,239
You'll notice right now I'm not so muscley. Check out what happens when you press A.

382
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:45,859
It's like I get pumped and macho just for the second the button is pressed.

383
01:41:45,859 --> 01:41:50,579
That's, that's cool. So I'm going to punch a bag and I need to be macho at the right times.

384
01:41:51,380 --> 01:42:10,869
Who comes up with this shit? This is so funny. Jab, jab, jab, jab. Let's try the old one too.

385
01:42:10,869 --> 01:42:53,399
I've got rhythm, rhythm. That's from the Muppets. Ozzy and, uh, uh, rope, what's it,

386
01:42:53,399 --> 01:43:01,770
Rolf the dog. They're, he's on the piano. Yes, it is. Did you say that's from Phineas and Ferb?

387
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:20,970
Fozzy Bear does that like 30 years ago. Did they take that from the Muppets? That's how dare they.

388
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:35,380
Go, go, go. Go, go, go. Go, go, go. Ozzy and Rolf the dog. No, it, I'm telling you,

389
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:41,430
keep pressing the buttons like that. We'll look it up. We'll look it up in a minute. Let's do this.

390
01:43:42,069 --> 01:45:07,859
Please clap it. Hey, don't reset. Why not? I want to get it right. I have to, I have to do it right.

391
01:45:08,739 --> 01:45:17,239
That was going to be a fail. Wait. Okay. Okay. I thought I couldn't skip this.

392
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:24,180
You would have gotten a great. I didn't deserve a great. You're supposed to fail.

393
01:45:24,579 --> 01:46:37,699
One, two, one, two, and jab. I'll reset. One, two, one, two, and jab. Jab, jab. Wicked, bad nerd neck.

394
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:56,710
Jab. One, two. Come on. I'm going to have horrible nerd neck. Is this even worth doing? I got okay.

395
01:46:56,710 --> 01:47:09,590
Fuck. Is this what you wanted? The fighters got potential. That's the first non-metal. I have to

396
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:19,560
get it right. I'll get it this time. I got an itchy nose too. I think that's quality.

397
01:47:21,539 --> 01:47:48,220
Get a haircut. Why didn't you turn the face cam on? I wonder. Let's go. I'm ready. You're going to

398
01:47:48,220 --> 01:49:34,760
see how I move when I, when I'm doing tutorials. Go. What? How was that wrong? Did I do it? I had

399
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:40,039
a water here, but I left it on the sidewalk and people were like ashing cigarettes in it all day.

400
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:48,199
I think water is still water though, isn't it? Oh, god damn it. I got a perfect on

401
01:49:49,000 --> 01:50:08,460
screw bot factory right now. All right. I'll get it. Turn the light on in your room. No,

402
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:14,550
then it'll be too bright for me and I'll get my headache. All right. Perfect. Perfect only. Stop

403
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:19,029
waving your hair like a fucking weirdo. I know I'm on camera. That's why I'm doing it.

404
01:50:20,149 --> 01:50:29,220
Keep going like this because I know people don't like my hair. Stop.

405
01:50:30,020 --> 01:51:13,079
Still count? Can I still do it? Can I still do this or is it over? Okay. All right. Here we go.

406
01:51:13,079 --> 01:51:56,390
Relax. Relax. Extreme bits. Somebody gave 5,000 bits. $50 from His Man. His Man? What's his name?

407
01:51:57,270 --> 01:52:11,770
His Man, yeah. His Manny, yeah. That's 5,000 bits. Hello, Mr. 985. Consider this my yearly

408
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:45,100
German subscription payment. I can't watch the screen so I end up watching. I'm still using

409
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:51,079
Streamlabs OBS and they didn't update today and I fucking get stuck. And they made it so I can't

410
01:52:51,079 --> 01:53:03,300
read this. No, it cuts it off. It's a mini feed. I never uninstalled Streamlabs OBS. Why would they

411
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:08,920
get rid of this? I used to be able to look over here in my Streamlabs OBS and it would just be

412
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:22,390
the message. Why did they get rid of it? Where is it? Use mustard. All right. What does it say?

413
01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:27,350
Consider this my yearly German subscription payment. I usually can't watch the live streams

414
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:34,149
so I end up watching the vlog channel. Big up the stream archive. All right. Cool. While I eat and

415
01:53:34,149 --> 01:53:38,310
cry over my university assignments, but thank you for every stream. These streams make everything

416
01:53:38,310 --> 01:53:43,109
a bit more bearable. I look forward to watching this in a few days. Lots of love. Thank you.

417
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:50,060
Thank you. No one's ever expected to catch every stream. I know how, I know how it could be.

418
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:57,340
You know, some of these streams get long. They go up to six, seven, eight, 10 plus hours sometimes.

419
01:53:58,729 --> 01:54:05,479
That's why I never, I can never expect anybody to do that. 13, especially playing the Lord of the

420
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:22,699
Rings. I have to get this. I don't care about the perfect eventually. He was doing better before he

421
01:54:22,699 --> 01:54:35,880
went on cam because I can like smell you guys like looking at me. I need my, where's my lip balm?

422
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:49,619
I don't think it's even in here anymore. What do you smell like? Brand new plastic.

423
01:54:55,319 --> 01:55:49,300
I can't do this one. I don't know. Why can't I? It's, it's like this light

424
01:55:49,380 --> 01:56:04,359
fucks with my head. It's like when it goes and close my eyes and close my eyes and close my eyes.

425
01:56:04,359 --> 01:57:45,300
Is that cheating? He's closing your eyes. Cheating. He's playing. Did I win? Nice combos.

426
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:51,460
You nailed the last part. Superb. Finally got a medal. I was, I was just feeling the music.

427
01:57:53,590 --> 01:57:57,670
I was listening to you. All right. If you would have mute this zoom in on my webcam and put on

428
01:57:57,670 --> 01:58:04,100
like Beethoven's symphony or something, it would probably match up a tiny new world champion.

429
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:15,319
That's me. Look at me. Remix three. Let's mix things up. This one's got lyrics because we

430
01:58:15,319 --> 01:58:38,550
realized we hadn't tried that one yet. Why does Dermot look like a school bully? Go, go, go.

431
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:39,100
I feel like I'm fighting a sneeze during a theater production. You don't want to be the guy that

432
01:59:39,100 --> 02:00:25,000
sneezes. Like when, when Romeo and Juliet drink the poison, you don't want to be the guy in the

433
02:00:25,000 --> 02:01:05,699
middle of the death scene to be like. Yeah. Spoilers for Romeo and Juliet. That's a four,

434
02:01:05,699 --> 02:01:14,520
500 year old piece of meat. Fuck dude. I haven't seen Romeo and Juliet yet. They've just made it

435
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:27,319
into a movie five times. It's been on Broadway for 700 years. Oh, and by the way, I read it in high

436
02:01:27,319 --> 02:01:36,630
school three times, but dude, it spoiled it for me. You did well enough to make your stage debut,

437
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:58,149
but not good enough. Here we go. Spoiled Romeo and Juliet. All right, let's go.

438
02:02:34,039 --> 02:02:43,800
My remote disconnected. That's, I know it's so easy for you to say that.

439
02:02:44,439 --> 02:03:18,649
One, two.

440
02:03:54,979 --> 02:04:30,869
It's so hard to press A over and over again when your fingers become covered in oil. Disgusting.

441
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:40,359
I'm covered in just water. Good enough? No. Oh, fucking come on. No, this is bad.

442
02:04:40,359 --> 02:04:51,609
And the, okay, in the original Wiimote, the A button is in, is this like slick plastic.

443
02:04:51,609 --> 02:05:15,779
It's a slick coating. It should be, it should be gripped. No, it's, it's, it's this really,

444
02:05:15,779 --> 02:07:55,619
really shiny slick plastic button. That's gotta be good enough. I don't know. I look like the guy

445
02:07:55,619 --> 02:08:01,460
that's at a party or that's at the wedding or that's at the club really, really, really wants

446
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:06,420
to start dancing, but he's not going to, may have had like two or three drinks already.

447
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:21,720
May be slightly inebriated. Really feel the music, but no, I'm not there yet. I did it.

448
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:27,460
You did well enough to headline a stadium concert. Well, look at that. Somebody redeemed a wink.

449
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:50,500
When? Wink redeemed? Did we get a wink? We did. Who did it? What do you want me to open? Yeah,

450
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:58,300
I know. I make fucking strange faces. I know. I see it. Who redeemed a wink? All right. All

451
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:13,130
right. All right. All right. It has to be full cam. You can see my cord. Did nobody redeem that?

452
02:09:13,689 --> 02:09:30,699
I think I might have just got scammed. Hey, look, it's everybody's favorite. It's everybody's

453
02:09:30,699 --> 02:09:35,420
favorite one. Live from ringside, we hear the champ's innermost thoughts and feelings after

454
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:45,939
the match. Here comes everybody's favorite one. The one that goes, whoa, you got big guy. I've

455
02:09:45,939 --> 02:09:51,340
heard this one. This one, this is the best song in the whole game. Thanks for agreeing to do a

456
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:59,109
ringside interview. Let's rehearse a bit. No, it's like, whoa, you got big guy. It's, it's hard to

457
02:09:59,109 --> 02:10:07,539
do. It's like, whoa, you got big guy. The voice is just, I think it's compression. Let's rehearse

458
02:10:07,539 --> 02:10:11,880
a bit before we go on camera. When I ask a question, press A to answer.

459
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:39,859
Wow. Your answers were so eloquent. Let's move on. If I say something like you go big guy,

460
02:10:39,859 --> 02:10:45,859
in quotes, that's a good time to show off. Press A twice quickly to show us what you got.

461
02:10:46,180 --> 02:11:19,000
A twice. Here it comes. There it is. A twice. Oh, I get it. I get it. Whoa. One last thing.

462
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:25,619
When the photographers are ready, they'll want you to strike a pose. Really flex those muscles.

463
02:11:25,619 --> 02:11:46,500
Press A and B together. Post for the fans. Yep. Pretty good. Thanks for your time.

464
02:11:46,500 --> 02:12:01,609
Let's go. See you after the match. Live from the Rhythm Arena. Oh, look at how sweaty he is.

465
02:12:14,069 --> 02:13:28,069
Yes. Sure. Yes. What a great song. I don't think it was perfect though.

466
02:13:29,189 --> 02:13:36,199
Wrestler exudes confidence in wit and wrestler poses impressively. Oh no, that one's over.

467
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:49,960
Oh, no question or opponent is too tough for this guy. There's a lot of songs. How many songs are

468
02:13:49,960 --> 02:14:01,930
there? If you get perfect on remix two right now, you'll get a gift. That's right. What were the

469
02:14:01,930 --> 02:14:13,050
songs? This is the clock one. No, I don't know if we'll be able to do this. It's the clock. Well,

470
02:14:13,050 --> 02:14:26,100
shit. I haven't done it in a while. I haven't done it. It's not happening. No, one more try.

471
02:14:26,979 --> 02:14:40,380
I haven't done it in a while. Is that true? Whoa, you got big guy. I'm close. Whoa, you got. I'm

472
02:14:40,380 --> 02:15:10,170
close. I'm actually close. Packing pests. Apologize for that. Do I have to apologize for doing every

473
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:19,289
single voice that's an animated character, an anime character? This is not even an anime

474
02:15:19,289 --> 02:15:24,569
character. This is a video game character. Why does everybody get so upset about this?

475
02:15:26,739 --> 02:15:29,939
Welcome to quality control. Product goes in the box. Anything else? Just knock it away. Let's

476
02:15:29,939 --> 02:15:42,409
get to work. You have to say sorry. Apologize. Apologize. Apologize. Apologize. Welcome to

477
02:15:42,409 --> 02:15:47,609
your training, new employee. Your main job here will be to sort product by clapping your hands.

478
02:15:48,729 --> 02:16:07,590
Press A and B to catch. Let's move on. Do it again. All right. Get rid of the bugs.

479
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:17,079
Catch the candies. How could you not like it? Let's move on to the next technique. You'll

480
02:16:17,079 --> 02:16:22,920
find the work easier if you get into rhythm. Pay attention to listen to the cues. One, two, three,

481
02:16:22,920 --> 02:17:07,540
four. It's gonna be bad for me. It's gonna be bad for me. It's gonna be bad for me. I can

482
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:40,649
already tell. I'm gonna have to close my eyes on this one again. Just don't. It's the things on

483
02:17:40,649 --> 02:17:44,569
the visual, the audios. It's just like it's scratching my head and rubbing my nose or whatever.

484
02:17:44,569 --> 02:18:45,159
You know, I'm like, okay, it's B and then A and then B. Okay. Why did it do that? I don't see

485
02:18:45,159 --> 02:18:50,629
a second nose. The visuals. Stop. Okay. I'm resetting. I know. I know. I know. Don't reset.

486
02:18:50,629 --> 02:19:03,139
Stop resetting. Angry red face. It's the nose. Yeah. The nose is okay. I'm ready. I got it done.

487
02:19:03,139 --> 02:20:23,209
See the nose already. What was that? That wasn't so bad. Don't look at chat. I'm not. I didn't look

488
02:20:23,209 --> 02:20:36,629
at chat once. You're a master spider sputterer. Completely spider free. Well done. Well done.

489
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:43,159
Jeremy, you look nice today. I hope everybody reading this has a nice weekend. What a fucking

490
02:20:43,159 --> 02:20:51,049
wonderfully nice thing to say about everybody in the chat. Nice work. Toys. Go check out the toys.

491
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:57,590
Oh shit. There are. There are toys. You're right. Police car. This toy is actually an

492
02:20:57,590 --> 02:21:00,950
investigation tool. When you discover anything suspicious, communicate with your information.

493
02:21:01,829 --> 02:21:11,079
Lieutenant, are you feeling better after that cold yet? You should look after yourself better.

494
02:21:13,110 --> 02:21:18,549
Well, I guess we should start our investigation. I'm not confident in life. People hate that.

495
02:21:21,670 --> 02:21:36,229
What was I going to do? All right. I don't get it. That's Shito. A? Maybe you got the code word

496
02:21:42,340 --> 02:22:13,000
wrong. Try to think. It must be something you've seen. Music? Note? What do you mean something

497
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:36,260
I've seen? A nose? I mean, I've seen a nose. Does that matter? I've seen a nose. Try to think.

498
02:22:36,260 --> 02:22:48,329
There must be something you've seen. Do I not have this info yet? Think. Cold? Cough? You knew

499
02:22:48,329 --> 02:23:00,549
that was wrong. I know I was going to do do. I've seen a nose, you know, and everyone's going to go.

500
02:23:00,549 --> 02:23:03,670
What the fuck? What are you doing? It's stupid. Fucking idiot. I'm going to go.

501
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:17,659
All right. What is the what? I don't get it. Radish. No, it's not. I'm getting out of here.

502
02:23:17,659 --> 02:23:27,860
I can't leave it. I think I quit this. I have. Have you played a high hat before? I have. If you

503
02:23:27,860 --> 02:23:33,959
have, this will be a cinch. If not, enjoy this opportunity to learn and grow as a person. Stop

504
02:23:33,959 --> 02:24:25,379
acting. I don't get it. Four beat. Eight beat. Sixteen beat. Dermot, react harder. I can't hear

505
02:24:25,379 --> 02:24:39,370
him. Can anybody hear him? Can anybody hear him? Can anybody hear him? Do something. React more.

506
02:24:39,370 --> 02:24:46,739
He's a boring YouTuber. I haven't uploaded a video for like four years. I'm not even a

507
02:24:46,739 --> 02:24:56,569
YouTuber anymore. I'm a Twitch TV partner. I don't like this new Dermot. All right. Let's go.

508
02:24:56,569 --> 02:25:22,659
Did it wrong the whole time? Remember how cool this was? All right. Let's go. This one's called

509
02:25:22,659 --> 02:25:32,420
Micro Row. Through the microscope, there's a whole other world. Yes, there is. Micro Row.

510
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:47,110
There's been selling out. I see you spotted us. Since you're here, you want to see our little march?

511
02:25:47,750 --> 02:26:16,520
Press A in time with the voice to march in one step. Start to lose your voice there. Go! Okay.

512
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:25,959
Next, we'll try it without the collar. I mean, there's somebody still making noise.

513
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:39,780
Sounds like Elmo when you miss. I don't I didn't I don't recall. Next, we'll try going three steps

514
02:26:39,780 --> 02:27:02,739
at once. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. We'll keep going like this.

515
02:27:04,649 --> 02:27:46,860
That's it. Okay. It's captured wrong. Streams wrong. Recorded. What are you talking about?

516
02:27:51,770 --> 02:27:57,770
I'm turning into. Oh, fuck. Hold on. I'm turning into like a copyright free image

517
02:27:58,489 --> 02:28:18,010
of like an old person that doesn't know how to use a computer. Like, oh, capture crime. Capture

518
02:28:18,010 --> 02:29:20,020
crime. Don't know. All right. That was good. I'm so confused. So am I. I'm actually not sure what

519
02:29:20,020 --> 02:29:28,950
happened. No metal. An army of evil spirits has invaded a peaceful village. Only a lone samurai

520
02:29:28,950 --> 02:29:44,680
can stop them. What dastardly deeds are they up to? The game glitched out. Yes. Press A to slice.

521
02:29:44,680 --> 02:30:14,360
Oh, this one's fun. I already like this one. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Okay. Impressive.

522
02:30:15,159 --> 02:30:22,950
Samurai technique to lots of slicing. Hold A and B a moment to hold A and B a moment from a whirlwind

523
02:30:22,950 --> 02:30:38,840
slice. It's okay. Oh, I sense a group of monsters lurking. Defeat them all at once with your

524
02:30:38,840 --> 02:31:10,790
whirlwind earlier. Okay. Why am I getting hit by the last one? Is it? I'm not. Oh, I'm not. Okay.

525
02:31:11,909 --> 02:31:24,860
Here we go. One, two, three. This song is fucking awesome.

526
02:31:26,219 --> 02:33:02,229
Our story. What? Yay. My pinwheel. I'm getting it. The pinwheel. Fuck. Actually lost to pinwheel.

527
02:33:02,309 --> 02:33:08,250
Actually lost to pinwheel. You sliced a lot of monsters and your sword moved so fast. Oh,

528
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:17,819
but still okay. Give me a break. I got almost all of them. I hear he's an okay samurai. I thought

529
02:33:17,819 --> 02:33:24,780
I did it. All right. We're going to clean this up. Clean this up. That's embarrassing. Embarrassing.

530
02:33:26,059 --> 02:33:36,600
Samurai slice. I can do it. He got hit by every whirlwind. But is that happening though?

531
02:33:37,399 --> 02:33:43,110
I thought you guys said that wasn't happening. No, that's not happening.

532
02:33:53,450 --> 02:34:11,219
You know, like the where are they now stuff. Where is that guy now? I wonder what that person is

533
02:34:11,219 --> 02:34:18,649
doing. That's one of the most iconic screams used in every single video game, anything.

534
02:35:58,840 --> 02:36:08,569
Got it. To be continued. Pinwheel boys. Gratitude. You sliced a lot of monsters through your sword.

535
02:36:09,530 --> 02:36:13,690
So you got the pinwheel back. You got back the pinwheel. I got pinwheel back.

536
02:36:15,719 --> 02:36:43,100
Thanks mister. You're the best. Thanks. That's weird. No practice. It's like there's something

537
02:36:43,100 --> 02:36:48,299
in there trying to get out and talk. Like I just swallowed something or somebody and they're talking.

538
02:36:49,260 --> 02:38:49,700
Like shut up. It's been a while since I've seen this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have to move. If I

539
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:58,379
don't move I can't do it. Like I have to snap. Snap. Snap. Snap. I have to be in the music.

540
02:39:04,969 --> 02:39:17,129
Right now the ninja continues his secret mission. There's a whole nother row. All right. Let me do

541
02:39:17,129 --> 02:39:21,559
that again. You get a perfect on tambourine right now. You know it's not going to happen.

542
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:36,540
Impossible for you to do that. No it's not. I can do it. Manka omega. Manka. Okay is it

543
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:45,850
Manka or is it Manka? Like Manka or is it Manka? I know how to do it. It's A in the Navy.

544
02:39:46,809 --> 02:40:53,000
Get it right. Let's okay. Mix things up. Let's go. How many? Let's get relaxed. There are mountains

545
02:40:53,000 --> 02:43:00,780
and a samurai must climb. My elbow. Okay that was pretty good. That was really great. Superb.

546
02:43:01,899 --> 02:43:09,909
I have to move. I swear to god it helps. It helps. Right now the ninja has completed his mission.

547
02:43:12,629 --> 02:43:36,840
What's with this Manka S? Manka S. Manka S. Manka S. I mean is it scary? Yes.

548
02:43:37,559 --> 02:43:55,590
You can't even see it. Let's go. I mean people are gonna think it's fucking weird

549
02:43:55,590 --> 02:44:03,780
out but like I have to actually do that. That helps. Catch of the day. If you come into the

550
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:09,139
stream for the first time and you see there's all the me doing this shit. I know but it actually

551
02:44:09,139 --> 02:44:21,139
does help. This one sucks. Catch of the day. Let's go fishing. When the fish bites press A to set the

552
02:44:21,139 --> 02:44:51,930
hook. The first fish you'll try to catch is the quick nibble. It's a B. Wait hold on. Oh okay.

553
02:44:51,930 --> 02:45:12,340
Well done. Next the pause gill. Take a one breath break before setting the hook. It's kind of

554
02:45:12,340 --> 02:45:26,139
tricky so I'll give you a Q. Without the Q. Oh let's try without the Q. Yeah let's go.

555
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:46,469
Just like that. Last the three fish. First we'll do it with the Q. Okay.

556
02:46:09,850 --> 02:46:38,520
Oh this is disturbing. What's disturbing? Here we go. All right I messed it up.

557
02:46:46,420 --> 02:47:34,739
Come do. Oh this one sucks. Okay.

558
02:47:39,639 --> 02:47:58,170
I can't get any. I can't get any. I'm not even gonna pass. That's the I'm getting into the beat.

559
02:47:58,170 --> 02:48:11,319
The visuals just fucking my head up. Try that again. Never rely on the visuals. Yeah but I mean

560
02:48:11,719 --> 02:48:39,610
I'm looking over here. Okay try again. You missed that one. Try another. I will. The streamer said

561
02:48:39,610 --> 02:48:59,500
the thing. I gotta bring out some of the references. Okay here we go. You. Not you. Don't do that.

562
02:48:59,500 --> 02:50:32,059
Don't shut up. God. I'm gonna get it perfect every single time. Ready watch this. I'm not

563
02:50:32,059 --> 02:50:41,420
gonna look at the screen. It's like the fish biting thing. I know it's cheating but don't

564
02:50:41,420 --> 02:52:06,940
mind. What am I doing wrong? Okay fuck that one. Bitrate went down. All right.

565
02:52:07,659 --> 02:52:22,309
Attention expedition team fall in. Are you ready to roll team? First press A. Attention company.

566
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:50,520
Nice. Look at how good they're doing. Let's try faster. Press A three times quickly. Okay.

567
02:52:50,520 --> 02:53:17,909
Attention company. Now we'll try a flipper roll. A and B together. Okay.

568
02:53:18,790 --> 02:53:54,069
Attention company. Oh I just heard somebody. What? This is the best one. This one seems really fun.

569
02:53:54,870 --> 02:53:57,829
Are we ready? Let's see how you do with consecutive flipper rolls.

570
02:53:58,790 --> 02:54:37,129
Just a little more. You can do it. I hope so. Attention company. Four flipper rolls.

571
02:54:37,129 --> 02:54:43,739
Four. Three. Four. All right. Time to go. I'm kind of tangled up. This one has animation.

572
02:54:44,620 --> 02:55:34,260
Attention. I'm turning into a fucking ping pong. What happened to his voice?

573
02:55:45,139 --> 02:56:30,860
Oh he's counting. It's like somebody was just doing that like ice pick inside my ear into my

574
02:56:30,860 --> 02:56:38,459
brain. Okay let's try it again. You're a terrible seal. Give me two more. All right I can do that

575
02:56:38,459 --> 02:56:54,489
one. Oh baseball. It's just like the going back and forth like this. This. This. This. This. This.

576
02:56:54,489 --> 02:58:48,170
At some point it's just like okay here we go. Fuck. One together. He's just counting. Hey I got it.

577
02:58:54,180 --> 02:59:04,870
Superb. Let's roll. Give me the cheers. It's baseball time. I'm looking forward to this one.

578
02:59:05,430 --> 02:59:12,899
Exhibition match. Okay Mr. Big Batting Hero. Time to show off your skills in an exhibition match.

579
02:59:12,899 --> 02:59:17,100
Don't let anything get past you. All right this is gonna be fun. I love the support.

580
02:59:18,059 --> 02:59:28,819
Let's take a look. Baseball. Let's practice before our big exhibition match.

581
02:59:29,620 --> 02:59:34,790
All you have to do is hit the ball when I pitch it. You might want to count to yourself to get

582
02:59:34,790 --> 02:59:54,170
the timing right. Wait. What? What kind of baseball? I thought it was gonna be fast.

583
02:59:58,299 --> 03:00:22,170
I gotta hold on. I'm gonna count myself. It goes. Ow my face. All right get to the real match.

584
03:00:22,170 --> 03:00:24,969
Oh by the way there are no cues in the real thing. Of course they're not.

585
03:00:55,479 --> 03:01:11,930
Why are you looking at me like that?

586
03:02:08,780 --> 03:02:17,719
I do it. Monkey umpire's call. You had a nice solid swing there and you get even with audio cues.

587
03:02:18,680 --> 03:02:29,750
Monkey was behind it the whole time. You won't see that one again. Almost. Yeah I missed one.

588
03:02:30,790 --> 03:02:39,860
That was cool. Block step. Coming up. It's amazing to see so many birds migrating together.

589
03:02:40,579 --> 03:02:43,540
Of course to avoid stepping on each other's toes they'll need good rhythm.

590
03:02:45,559 --> 03:02:54,709
All right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Block step. Is this a pretty popular one it seems from the audience?

591
03:02:55,670 --> 03:03:02,420
I don't think I've ever heard this song. No I've seen this song with the birds. Okay let's march

592
03:03:02,420 --> 03:03:25,299
together. Have I heard this song? Press A to the B. Why am I desynced? I shouldn't be desynced should

593
03:03:25,299 --> 03:03:31,959
I? Let's get tricky. You need to press A and B. Hold A and B to get ready then release to jump.

594
03:03:33,739 --> 03:04:26,780
That's it. Okay let's go. The flock is waiting. Where am I? Oh fucking smash.

595
03:04:27,659 --> 03:04:51,030
Wait which one am I? I can't. I can't take. I don't know who you're calling. I don't know who you are.

596
03:04:51,030 --> 03:06:06,520
You're the golden one. This bit rate is dying because of this. I failed it for sure. I failed

597
03:06:06,520 --> 03:06:14,229
it for sure. Yeah whatever. I don't care. I'll do it again. That one's fun. Good enough apparently.

598
03:06:16,780 --> 03:06:22,069
Let's do it again. Do it again. That one was fun. I'll get it this time. Perfect. Long road ahead.

599
03:06:22,069 --> 03:06:31,450
I got left behind. You get a perfect on fighter figure fighter right now. Oh yeah I can do that.

600
03:06:33,590 --> 03:06:37,670
Absolutely easy. Easiest thing I've done all night. All day. It's like a football in the afternoon.

601
03:06:39,270 --> 03:06:47,459
What do you guys think of these early streams? You like them? Oh this is not the one I thought it was.

602
03:06:47,459 --> 03:06:51,219
I thought this was um I thought this was the the flex one. I'm not gonna be able to do this

603
03:06:52,100 --> 03:10:33,510
but I'll try. Once I fuck the first one up. Omega long loser. Okay here we go. That's gotta be good.

604
03:10:33,510 --> 03:10:45,780
You stuck it to the end. Stuck it out to the end. Oh okay I messed up like once.

605
03:10:47,180 --> 03:11:01,579
I screwed it up only one time. How did I do that wrong? Really? That's sad. I messed up way more

606
03:11:01,579 --> 03:11:07,799
than once. No I didn't. I bounced back and forth like twice. Maybe. You were ahead of beat the whole

607
03:11:07,799 --> 03:11:26,790
time. Was I? No I wasn't. Hopping and I'm not paying attention. It's down. Foot. Foot. Foot. Foot. Foot.

608
03:11:26,790 --> 03:11:35,319
Foot. You have to hold A. You have to go A. A. A. A. A. Okay I get it. I'll get it this time.

609
03:11:35,879 --> 03:13:23,850
Let's mix things up. No practice. Oh remix five. Is he okay? Oh it's got fish in it. The fish.

610
03:13:23,850 --> 03:13:30,809
I can't do it. I can't do the fish. I can't do it. The fish just fucked up everything for me.

611
03:13:31,450 --> 03:13:51,819
It's that like half. You were eaten by a t-rex. All right. I didn't mess up the baseball. Yeah

612
03:13:51,819 --> 03:13:56,940
because I mean I know how to do that one. I might need to practice the fish. No I don't. It's three

613
03:13:56,940 --> 03:15:50,780
seconds. One. Two. Three. Go. I just did it. I fucking did it. But you're nunchuck away. Right. Okay.

614
03:15:53,100 --> 03:15:58,299
Yeah I guess that makes. Yeah that makes sense.

615
03:16:13,770 --> 03:16:14,969
Just get it. I have to get it.

616
03:16:14,969 --> 03:17:34,940
One. Two. Three. Go. Two. Three. Go. Three. Go. Three. Go. All right. Come on. That's got to be enough.

617
03:17:42,680 --> 03:17:50,500
All you guys say no. If you were a dinosaur you'd be a high flying

618
03:17:52,379 --> 03:18:03,610
Pteranodon. Check the new toys. This game's a lot of fun. I'm really happy I played this.

619
03:18:05,639 --> 03:18:10,840
Rhythm fighter. Use rhythm in a new way to knock out an opponent. This game requires two

620
03:18:10,840 --> 03:18:24,309
Wii remotes. Launch party. Countdown to launch. Or rather countdown to launches. Quite a few of them

621
03:18:24,309 --> 03:18:36,680
in fact. Okay. I can't believe I was holding that fucking nunchuck the whole time. Welcome aboard

622
03:18:36,680 --> 03:18:44,760
our space station. The job here will be to help us launch the rockets. Just hit A when the countdown

623
03:18:44,760 --> 03:19:26,899
reaches zero. Good job. Here's a different model of rocket to try. Does he have a safety strap on?

624
03:19:27,770 --> 03:19:46,540
Nope. This one doesn't require moving. There's a new one. I gotta memorize these. They're gonna

625
03:19:46,540 --> 03:20:08,090
throw them. It's gonna be all messed up. They're gonna mess it all up on me. Let's do exactly that

626
03:20:08,090 --> 03:21:33,079
for the real mission. Good luck. Congrats on your successful launches and you stayed focused amid

627
03:21:33,079 --> 03:21:46,360
distraction. Made contact. Yes we have. You look like the person in the orchestra that makes the

628
03:21:46,360 --> 03:22:01,579
gestures. The yellow webcam is a little fucked up isn't it? It's all you get. Perfect on working

629
03:22:01,579 --> 03:22:14,420
dough right now. You'll get it. I'll try it. Has he gotten it perfect on anything? Yeah. A couple

630
03:22:14,420 --> 03:23:31,340
times no. All right let's go. A and then A B for the big ones. This one's hard to explain. Just focus

631
03:23:31,340 --> 03:23:45,219
on switching between the two rhythms. You'll get the hang of it. Comes dunk dunk. Hey guys let's

632
03:23:45,219 --> 03:23:51,620
get ready to do that thing we do. Let's warm up before we go. No injuries please. Press A in the

633
03:23:51,620 --> 03:24:13,559
time to the signal. This is hard to explain. Just do it. That's the way. Haven't lost the magic yet.

634
03:24:13,559 --> 03:24:37,379
How about this one? Let's try mixing up both rhythms. The rhythm changes after you hear

635
03:24:37,459 --> 03:25:21,260
dunk. Let's go do that thing we do. So it's dunk then we.

636
03:26:41,930 --> 03:26:53,530
I'm so glad he's having so much fun. He clearly felt the driving rhythm video. The

637
03:26:53,530 --> 03:26:56,090
celebrated rhythm was spot on. Also you kept up with the changes.

638
03:26:58,860 --> 03:27:06,569
Nothing can stop us now. That was pretty fun. That was a good one. How many more games are there?

639
03:27:06,569 --> 03:27:09,450
Let's see, we got five, right? Five in a row.

640
03:27:09,450 --> 03:27:13,450
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty, thirty, thirty-five, so far, coming up here.

641
03:29:44,790 --> 03:30:07,100
Bumper, it's the grease. That's what I just did.

642
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:22,760
That's when Bilbo grabs the ring.

643
03:30:27,059 --> 03:30:31,299
Primitive people played a lot more primitive volleyball than most people realized.

644
03:30:31,299 --> 03:30:33,379
Also, their music was pretty sophisticated.

645
03:30:34,260 --> 03:30:42,309
Oh god, this one. Let's go around this one.

646
03:30:42,389 --> 03:30:50,629
Why hello there. Shall we practice our bumping skills together?

647
03:30:51,909 --> 03:30:54,620
Press A to bump away things that fly at you.

648
03:30:55,819 --> 03:31:15,899
That was great, you really nailed it.

649
03:31:15,899 --> 03:31:18,059
Why don't we switch? You can try out my side.

650
03:31:20,659 --> 03:31:21,159
Ready?

651
03:31:22,979 --> 03:31:43,959
Let's try switching midstream.

652
03:31:43,959 --> 03:31:44,459
Ready?

653
03:32:07,020 --> 03:32:08,059
Great hands.

654
03:32:08,059 --> 03:32:10,309
You did great. Let's go try the real thing.

655
03:32:10,309 --> 03:32:10,809
Let's go.

656
03:33:03,989 --> 03:33:04,489
Foam!

657
03:33:49,100 --> 03:33:51,750
I just went right in the head.

658
03:34:16,790 --> 03:34:17,510
I didn't say that.

659
03:34:19,079 --> 03:34:19,579
They did.

660
03:34:22,299 --> 03:34:24,219
Tips from the Valley Girl.

661
03:34:24,219 --> 03:34:24,860
Volley Girl.

662
03:34:25,500 --> 03:34:27,819
Nice bumping technique and switching was no problem for you.

663
03:34:27,819 --> 03:34:28,319
Superb.

664
03:34:29,260 --> 03:34:32,120
Perfect couple.

665
03:34:35,159 --> 03:34:43,219
Pro Bumper.

666
03:34:43,219 --> 03:34:43,940
Love rap.

667
03:34:45,559 --> 03:34:48,360
Love, it's the most powerful feeling in the world.

668
03:34:48,360 --> 03:34:51,879
And there's no better way to express it than through the ancient art of hip-hop.

669
03:34:53,000 --> 03:35:08,200
Let's rap.

670
03:35:08,200 --> 03:35:08,840
Follow me.

671
03:35:22,489 --> 03:35:23,209
Is that how I talk?

672
03:35:26,020 --> 03:35:27,940
Oh, okay.

673
03:35:30,979 --> 03:35:35,159
Hopefully we can do it at the same time.

674
03:35:35,159 --> 03:35:35,719
Keep it going.

675
03:35:50,090 --> 03:35:51,450
I like this one. This one's fun.

676
03:35:51,450 --> 03:35:52,250
I like your flow.

677
03:35:52,250 --> 03:35:53,049
Let's go.

678
03:35:53,049 --> 03:35:53,610
Something else.

679
03:35:53,770 --> 03:36:02,379
Let's rap again.

680
03:36:02,379 --> 03:36:02,879
Okay.

681
03:36:13,340 --> 03:36:14,379
So he's choking!

682
03:36:14,379 --> 03:36:15,659
Can somebody save this guy?

683
03:36:30,170 --> 03:36:31,069
I hit it right at the end of the song, okay.

684
03:36:31,129 --> 03:36:35,719
Why was it so high?

685
03:36:35,719 --> 03:36:36,719
How about this?

686
03:36:49,360 --> 03:36:50,360
I did it wrong.

687
03:37:10,920 --> 03:37:11,920
I got it.

688
03:37:23,670 --> 03:37:24,670
Okay, I got it.

689
03:37:40,180 --> 03:37:43,190
Just delete the right wrapper.

690
03:37:43,190 --> 03:37:44,190
There's another thing to try.

691
03:37:44,190 --> 03:37:45,190
Why is my desk so hot?

692
03:37:45,190 --> 03:37:51,100
I'm gonna f**k myself up.

693
03:38:36,180 --> 03:38:42,129
You all about you all about you all about you all about you all about you all about you

694
03:38:42,290 --> 03:38:48,129
All right, this is gonna be weird. It's gonna take so long for the real thing. Yeah, it is

695
03:38:48,629 --> 03:38:52,590
I'm gonna mess this up probably ten times in a row. Here we go. It's different timings for each one

696
03:39:29,139 --> 03:39:36,899
Crazy into you crazy into you crazy into you crazy into you

697
03:39:59,510 --> 03:40:01,510
All about you

698
03:40:12,510 --> 03:40:16,270
She changed the beat into you into you

699
03:40:23,059 --> 03:40:36,709
Only turned it off. I don't think I liked it. We're all about you're all about you. Ah

700
03:40:37,309 --> 03:40:43,110
Ah, that's too bad it comes a sneeze. How do I get out? I get it? I can stop how do we I?

701
03:40:45,879 --> 03:40:47,879
Got I think I focus on my face

702
03:40:51,790 --> 03:41:09,739
Boogers all of me. I think I'm all right. This is why I don't do thank you. We good

703
03:41:13,920 --> 03:41:20,100
I'm so paranoid. This is like this is not somewhere on my face like in my hair. I

704
03:41:20,659 --> 03:41:25,969
Need a mirror. I can't turn it back on at least unless I know

705
03:41:26,549 --> 03:41:31,239
It could be like that could be like a stray booger in my hair

706
03:41:40,590 --> 03:41:42,590
I don't do that one again

707
03:41:43,909 --> 03:41:48,459
Not bad

708
03:41:50,219 --> 03:41:58,079
All right, we're in remix six, let's mix things up this one's carnival themed I'll take you back to your youth unless you're still there

709
03:42:30,569 --> 03:42:37,610
Remix six. Ah

710
03:42:38,770 --> 03:42:41,530
No practice. Ah, it starts off with this

711
03:43:46,350 --> 03:43:48,350
I

712
03:44:04,889 --> 03:44:06,889
Got timing

713
03:44:33,290 --> 03:44:38,260
Okay, that was tricky that was a train wreck well, I mean

714
03:44:39,219 --> 03:44:42,540
You gotta see once or twice before you know, one of the things that happens

715
03:44:42,940 --> 03:44:45,620
Your skill was a business trip you'd miss a meeting down the hall

716
03:44:46,219 --> 03:44:58,639
They left hairline. What about it? I think it looks pretty good

717
03:45:07,420 --> 03:45:11,329
I'll be 30 goddamn five in

718
03:45:12,229 --> 03:45:15,450
2020 this is looking pretty good for three five

719
03:45:16,389 --> 03:45:19,209
Now, excuse me. I've got some donk donks to take care

720
03:45:34,229 --> 03:45:37,069
Crazy

721
03:46:52,239 --> 03:47:26,319
You get a purpose on remix for right now yellow no, I like it. Yes, brother. I'm trying to do remix six

722
03:47:26,920 --> 03:47:33,579
You are the mule

723
03:47:34,620 --> 03:47:36,920
Booger face Billy

724
03:48:11,229 --> 03:48:13,840
Fuck

725
03:49:33,979 --> 03:49:36,280
Nailed it I didn't get okay

726
03:49:38,680 --> 03:49:44,569
I think that I think a lot of people are misunderstanding when I do the remixes

727
03:49:44,770 --> 03:49:51,959
It's you can't it's hard to have rhythm when you have to play seven different songs that intercut into each other

728
03:49:52,760 --> 03:50:00,120
That's like if you have a guitarist that's on stage and he's playing song one and then in the middle of the song

729
03:50:00,120 --> 03:50:02,120
the lead singer goes

730
03:50:02,399 --> 03:50:03,770
song

731
03:50:03,770 --> 03:50:08,809
Four song on the album and that's why we and he's just like fuck is happening. Why are you doing this?

732
03:50:08,809 --> 03:50:10,809
Okay, they're gonna go song four on the album

733
03:50:10,809 --> 03:50:14,200
You don't think it's mid song

734
03:50:21,139 --> 03:50:23,139
How are you supposed to do that?

735
03:50:23,139 --> 03:50:39,819
Sorry, you've had it remixes Jeremy. I just got a gold star on that one called medley

736
03:50:44,510 --> 03:50:49,329
Fucking water you're aware games. This is not like me having a guitar in my hand

737
03:50:50,149 --> 03:50:53,639
Yeah, you know, I just don't think he has very much medley

738
03:50:54,319 --> 03:50:58,799
Playing the Mario where micro games that go one two, three. What does it go?

739
03:50:59,440 --> 03:51:04,620
All right, here we go. This is called tap group

740
03:51:05,059 --> 03:51:15,209
The taps on his shoes and boxes on their heads this quartet of dream is stardom. We understand the task of the head boxes

741
03:51:15,610 --> 03:51:32,559
Time to tap. Let's start with basic stepping in sync with one another

742
03:51:33,639 --> 03:51:37,159
Was me all right

743
03:51:38,040 --> 03:52:03,079
Okay, so that's pretty simple. I'm we're gonna add the net. Let's try mixing up the rhythm slightly

744
03:52:03,719 --> 03:52:05,719
Listen closely to the rhythm

745
03:52:06,809 --> 03:52:08,809
Patterns on ready

746
03:52:09,649 --> 03:53:03,930
Three taps, okay, let's try that again, but a bit shorter this time

747
03:53:35,440 --> 03:53:38,059
Even shorter

748
03:53:41,219 --> 03:54:18,989
Let's that's it I think we're ready are we all right show time everybody break a leg I wasn't ready I wasn't ready

749
03:54:18,989 --> 03:54:21,430
I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready

750
03:54:21,430 --> 03:54:24,670
It was I was thinking about how I have to go to the bathroom. I have to go to the bathroom

751
03:54:24,670 --> 03:54:27,360
I gotta go to the bathroom

752
03:54:27,520 --> 03:56:24,559
Long

753
03:56:24,559 --> 03:56:29,159
Back. Oh, no about a step. He didn't put his leg back. He didn't put his leg back

754
03:56:29,920 --> 03:56:42,290
He didn't like put his leg back. Oh, they're huge friendly feedback. Yeah, good enough. I gotta pee

755
03:56:42,930 --> 03:59:53,379
We're back

756
03:59:53,620 --> 04:00:01,010
We did it didn't we? Let me get this off

757
04:00:02,090 --> 04:00:05,590
Okay, I

758
04:00:06,069 --> 04:00:09,879
Can do that I can do that one better. I can do that one better

759
04:00:21,780 --> 04:00:23,780
Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap

760
04:00:26,739 --> 04:00:57,329
You know what pretty game like this online multiplayer

761
04:01:00,819 --> 04:01:03,180
And everybody's on the screen

762
04:01:15,520 --> 04:02:29,260
Amazing nice fail nerd. I respect your opinion and I respect you being mean to me

763
04:02:29,940 --> 04:02:31,940
But I'm not gonna take it

764
04:02:32,139 --> 04:02:38,260
Get him out of here. All right, ah still okay what I only messed up once I messed up one time

765
04:02:39,139 --> 04:02:42,219
That was that bad

766
04:02:43,100 --> 04:02:45,299
Shrimp shuffle

767
04:02:45,299 --> 04:02:50,659
Shrimp make surprisingly good dancers and will jump at the chance to show off their skills try not to bump into anyone

768
04:02:51,459 --> 04:02:55,030
Shrimp. Oh, no

769
04:03:05,010 --> 04:03:10,860
Seizure warning here. Is there where the shrimp?

770
04:03:11,780 --> 04:03:13,780
Camper is a low tide dance troop

771
04:03:14,459 --> 04:03:17,860
Take a deep breath wait

772
04:03:17,860 --> 04:03:26,579
Is it actually like a seizure warning here? We specialize in synchronized dancing like a chorus line

773
04:03:27,100 --> 04:03:30,040
You know what? Let's just show you

774
04:03:48,299 --> 04:04:36,040
That's tricky. All right. Next we really show off our cool dance moves

775
04:04:36,760 --> 04:04:40,700
You'll hear ABC on C press A and B

776
04:04:48,620 --> 04:05:33,819
This is truly the worst one let's mix it up and shift the rhythm a little bit game sucks

777
04:05:35,719 --> 04:05:41,920
You've lost your damn mind. What are you on? What the hell are you on? When we give the signal pause for a moment?

778
04:06:08,940 --> 04:06:29,219
I

779
04:06:29,219 --> 04:06:34,139
Alright, no, no, no, I need it to like pause and then start over because it's like it's fucking blending together my brain

780
04:06:56,500 --> 04:09:02,139
This one's tricky actually is he's so into it. Yeah, I have to you have to get really into it

781
04:09:05,459 --> 04:09:09,530
If you if I don't lock in and just right I can't be like so

782
04:09:10,209 --> 04:09:14,450
What are you guys saying lately? Three two one eight B and C. I

783
04:09:15,209 --> 04:09:17,850
What time no, I can't I have to focus. I

784
04:09:18,569 --> 04:09:21,129
Can't speak

785
04:09:22,969 --> 04:09:31,260
Cheer readers come it up, you know who doesn't get enough support people studying at the library

786
04:09:31,500 --> 04:09:33,620
Let's cheer these dedicated students on

793
04:10:35,670 --> 04:11:02,100
Rissoum baboom

794
04:11:02,100 --> 04:11:05,750
rissoum baboom

795
04:11:05,750 --> 04:11:07,750
rissoum baboom

Our most difficult stunt we all do this one at once. So get ready

797

Let's go read a bunch of books, let's go read a bunch of books

801
04:12:41,559 --> 04:12:43,559
Okay, it's on

802
04:12:44,760 --> 04:13:10,420
All right, it's it's on i'm gonna lose it, but I had to say it will do it

803
04:13:11,219 --> 04:13:13,219
You just embarrassed the team

804
04:13:14,739 --> 04:13:19,569
You fell to pieces near the end. What was the whole thing? Let's go read a bunch of books

805
04:13:21,569 --> 04:13:30,239
You keep it down the osc is really good the game is really good, too

806
04:13:32,639 --> 04:13:46,360
All right, here we go you're never gonna get to regionals here we go focus

807
04:13:47,319 --> 04:15:13,559
That's gotta be good enough for uh, at least it's uh, superb

808
04:15:14,520 --> 04:15:18,040
I let I screwed up. I once was twice maybe he kept in sync where it counted got it

809
04:15:19,319 --> 04:15:24,100
So you have a mullet

810
04:15:24,100 --> 04:15:27,059
No mullet is my hair is longer in the back than it is in the front

811
04:15:28,469 --> 04:15:31,110
No, I don't have a mullet behind my head

812
04:15:32,229 --> 04:15:43,750
Mullet, but it's just going back behind the ears

813
04:15:45,239 --> 04:15:47,079
emo peter parker

814
04:15:47,079 --> 04:15:54,000
You get perfect on forklifter. I could probably do it

815
04:15:54,799 --> 04:15:56,399
I was all right with this

816
04:15:59,600 --> 04:16:01,600
You have seen kid hair

817
04:16:01,840 --> 04:16:04,420
Just that hair that goes back behind my ears

818
04:16:05,299 --> 04:17:43,590
Here we go

819
04:17:43,590 --> 04:17:52,639

Karate man

826
04:18:46,530 --> 04:18:48,930
This is karate training at its most intense

827
04:18:49,569 --> 04:18:53,250
Punch the flying objects and go crazy when a whole mess of them come at you

828
04:18:56,979 --> 04:19:03,000

1148
05:13:20,240 --> 05:13:28,220
What a thing to bring out right now. All right, if you don't know I it was okay TLDR. I was I

1149
05:13:28,979 --> 05:13:32,099
had a CD in my car and I was driving some people and

1150
05:13:34,349 --> 05:13:36,349
What do you got for music?

1151
05:13:37,590 --> 05:13:44,069
Classical music and it was it I had I didn't I had a video game OST in the fucking CD player and it's a TLDR

1152
05:13:44,069 --> 05:13:50,270
Just huge TLDR. Um, I put this song was just playing and nobody thought it was cool

1153
05:13:50,590 --> 05:13:52,509
They were just silent and I'm just sitting there going

1154
05:13:52,509 --> 05:13:56,750
Oh, this is the music that I really think is cool. It's a video game OST inside the CD player

1155
05:13:56,750 --> 05:13:58,590
That was like, oh what's on the radio?

1156
05:13:58,630 --> 05:14:04,509
And it was this song I mean this let's be really honest here this song is fucking fantastic

1157
05:14:04,509 --> 05:14:09,549
This is one of the best battle musics ever. It's too bad. That game was like a 7 out of 10

1158
05:14:09,669 --> 05:14:14,229
It was like a 7.2 out of 10 and I wish they made another one because it would have been cool

1159
05:14:14,229 --> 05:14:17,549
But it was a good was pretty good game, but the song is like a 10 out of 10

1160
05:14:18,189 --> 05:14:22,409
It's the battle music The Lost Odyssey

05:16:59,799 --> 05:17:01,799
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off

1187
05:17:03,799 --> 05:17:10,009
No, I have to stop playing

1188
05:17:10,009 --> 05:17:12,889
Alright, you know what I mean?

1189
05:17:12,889 --> 05:17:14,889
I don't know why my face

1190
05:17:14,889 --> 05:17:16,889
The way that my face is shaped

1191
05:17:16,889 --> 05:17:18,889
The eyes, the mouth

1192
05:17:18,889 --> 05:17:20,889
I don't know, it's a combination of everything

1193
05:17:20,889 --> 05:17:22,889
I'm like every YouTuber I've ever seen

1194
05:17:22,889 --> 05:17:25,319
I feel like this is YouTube thumbnails

1195
05:17:27,319 --> 05:17:34,040
That's like a

1196
05:17:34,040 --> 05:17:38,459
This one's better

1197
05:17:38,459 --> 05:17:40,459
How do you still have these?

1198
05:17:40,459 --> 05:17:42,459
I already showed that one

1199
05:17:42,459 --> 05:17:44,759
Do the other one

1200
05:17:44,759 --> 05:17:46,759
I just showed it

1201
05:17:46,759 --> 05:17:53,470
I just showed that one

1202
05:17:53,470 --> 05:17:55,470
I just put that on screen

1203
05:17:55,470 --> 05:18:02,319
This is not already another one, right?

1204
05:18:02,319 --> 05:18:06,349
Are you really going to put that in here after all this?

1205
05:18:06,349 --> 05:18:08,349
That's where you're going after this?

1206
05:18:08,349 --> 05:18:10,349
That's where you're going

1207
05:18:10,349 --> 05:18:12,349
That's where you're going

1208
05:18:12,349 --> 05:18:14,349
That's what you're doing

1209
05:18:14,349 --> 05:18:18,430
Alright, you've killed it

1210
05:18:18,430 --> 05:18:20,430
You've slayed it

1211
05:18:20,430 --> 05:18:23,240
You killed it, now let's go

1212
05:18:23,240 --> 05:18:25,240
You've actually killed it

1213
05:18:25,240 --> 05:18:31,770
You killed it

1214
05:18:31,770 --> 05:18:36,250
Oh, super golf

1215
05:18:36,250 --> 05:18:42,270
Okay, what the fuck

1216
05:20:13,580 --> 05:20:39,560
The monkey was very impressive

1217
05:20:39,560 --> 05:20:41,560
Super

1218
05:20:41,560 --> 05:20:50,060
Perfect score

1219
05:20:50,060 --> 05:20:55,759
First try

1220
05:20:55,759 --> 05:20:57,759
That's a golden medal

1221
05:20:57,759 --> 05:20:59,759
We've only got

1222
05:20:59,759 --> 05:21:01,759
And then we've got one more

1223
05:21:01,759 --> 05:21:03,759
Row

1224
05:21:03,759 --> 05:21:06,060
We have done it

1225
05:21:06,060 --> 05:21:11,500
God, so

1226
05:21:11,500 --> 05:21:13,500
Again, by the way, Community Content Day

1227
05:21:13,500 --> 05:21:15,500
That's right, it's Community Content Day

1228
05:21:15,500 --> 05:21:17,500
Community Content Day

1229
05:21:17,500 --> 05:21:19,500
Is going to be tomorrow afternoon

1230
05:21:19,500 --> 05:21:21,500
Tomorrow morning, probably around 11-ish

1231
05:21:21,500 --> 05:21:23,500
11.30, 12

1232
05:21:23,500 --> 05:21:25,500
12-ish

1233
05:21:25,500 --> 05:21:27,500
No, no, no, no

1234
05:21:27,500 --> 05:21:29,500
It's going to be

1235
05:21:29,500 --> 05:21:31,500
1?

1236
05:21:31,500 --> 05:21:35,340
1pm?

1237
05:21:35,340 --> 05:21:41,799
Hold on, let me think about this

1238
05:21:41,799 --> 05:21:44,490
1pm tomorrow is going to be

1239
05:21:44,490 --> 05:21:46,490
Community Content Day

1240
05:21:46,490 --> 05:21:48,919
And

1241
05:21:48,919 --> 05:21:50,919
It's going to be split into two

1242
05:21:50,919 --> 05:21:52,919
Because there's going to be a lot

1243
05:21:52,919 --> 05:21:54,919
Because I delayed it because

1244
05:21:54,919 --> 05:21:56,919
There's a million reasons why

1245
05:21:56,919 --> 05:21:58,919
I was going to do the Green Screen DLC free

1246
05:21:58,919 --> 05:22:00,919
That didn't work out

1247
05:22:00,919 --> 05:22:02,919
So we're going to split it into two days

1248
05:22:02,919 --> 05:22:04,919
One next week for a short amount of time

1249
05:22:04,919 --> 05:22:06,919
And then one next week for a short amount of time

1250
05:22:06,919 --> 05:22:08,919
There you go

1251
05:22:08,919 --> 05:22:10,919
That's the plan

1252
05:22:10,919 --> 05:22:19,040
Robot Factory 2

1253
05:22:19,040 --> 05:22:21,040
How long are you going to do EU-friendly streams?

1254
05:22:21,040 --> 05:22:23,040
Oh, it was only these two days

1255
05:22:23,040 --> 05:22:45,229
Shit, breaking it next

1256
05:22:45,229 --> 05:24:07,900
We're good

1257
05:24:07,900 --> 05:24:11,150
Could have been better

1258
05:24:11,150 --> 05:24:13,150
That's alright

1259
05:24:13,150 --> 05:24:15,389
Here's where we store the robot's sense of duty

1260
05:24:17,630 --> 05:24:21,340
Remix

1261
05:24:21,340 --> 05:24:23,340
We're going to get a perfect on samurai slice right now

1262
05:24:33,959 --> 05:25:26,569
You can't mess up two times

1263
05:25:26,569 --> 05:25:28,569
If you mess up once, it's just fucking over

1264
05:25:28,569 --> 05:25:31,130
Remix, here we go

1265
05:25:31,130 --> 05:25:51,209
I didn't, I know

1266
05:26:43,529 --> 05:26:45,529
It's head-surfing

1267
05:26:58,779 --> 05:27:04,029
Holy fuck

1268
05:28:07,200 --> 05:28:09,200
Ban, then mod

1269
05:28:09,200 --> 05:28:11,200
Then ban, then mod, then mod him twice

1270
05:28:11,200 --> 05:28:13,200
Then VIP him, then delete his account

1271
05:28:13,200 --> 05:28:16,970
And then send him a hundred

1272
05:28:16,970 --> 05:28:19,529
I can't say that

1273
05:28:19,529 --> 05:28:21,529
Hello

1274
05:28:21,529 --> 05:28:23,529
Hello, a hundred, hello

1275
05:28:23,529 --> 05:28:34,330
Times that by ten

1276
05:28:34,330 --> 05:28:36,330
I was going to say

1277
05:28:36,330 --> 05:28:39,150
I was going to say

1278
05:28:39,150 --> 05:28:41,150
Disconnected from the last statement

1279
05:28:41,150 --> 05:28:43,150
The word I was going to say was money

1280
05:28:43,150 --> 05:28:52,040
Okay

1281
05:29:15,689 --> 05:29:51,770
Read a lot of books

1282
05:29:51,770 --> 05:30:16,779
Read a lot of books

1283
05:30:29,279 --> 05:30:34,650
What the fuck am I doing?

1284
05:30:34,650 --> 05:30:36,650
I just looked over at the preview and I don't like that

1285
05:30:38,650 --> 05:30:50,880
Level nine

1286
05:30:54,909 --> 05:30:57,080
Pepe lap, try again

1287
05:30:57,080 --> 05:30:59,080
Pepe lap

1288
05:31:02,540 --> 05:31:10,029
It's on

1289
05:31:26,639 --> 05:32:40,880
A feet

1290
05:32:53,439 --> 05:32:58,750
I fucking don't like that

1291
05:32:58,750 --> 05:33:00,750
Segment

1292
05:33:00,750 --> 05:33:02,750
Good enough, I got it

1293
05:33:02,750 --> 05:33:10,110
Because you suck

1294
05:33:17,150 --> 05:33:19,150
I don't want to say that because then you'll use it

1295
05:33:19,150 --> 05:33:21,150
And you'll make me look like I said I think German

1296
05:33:21,150 --> 05:33:27,360
Alright, here we go

1297
05:33:27,360 --> 05:33:29,360
We're almost there

1298
05:33:29,360 --> 05:33:33,959
Take your fighter two

1299
05:33:33,959 --> 05:33:35,959
The last five games

1300
05:33:35,959 --> 05:33:38,400
Then

1301
05:33:38,400 --> 05:33:41,659
I'm out of here

1302
05:33:41,659 --> 05:33:43,659
Night walk for the final remix

1303
05:33:43,659 --> 05:33:46,540
Do I?

1304
05:34:05,979 --> 05:35:23,229
I can do better than that

1305
05:35:23,229 --> 05:35:25,229
Let me rephrase this

1306
05:35:25,229 --> 05:35:27,229
Keep your guard up

1307
05:35:27,229 --> 05:35:29,529
Hold on, let me rephrase this one

1308
05:35:29,529 --> 05:35:39,200
Let me rephrase this

1309
05:35:39,200 --> 05:35:41,200
Here we go again

1310
05:35:41,200 --> 05:35:43,819
Okay, let me rephrase this one

1311
05:35:43,819 --> 05:35:59,689
I don't even know the timing in this

1312
05:35:59,689 --> 05:36:01,689
Whatever, we don't take your fighter two

1313
05:36:04,750 --> 05:36:11,470
Oh, he's so close to remix ten

1314
05:36:11,470 --> 05:36:13,470
I am, I'm getting there

1315
05:36:15,959 --> 05:36:17,959
Am I supposed to punch there?

1316
05:37:13,340 --> 05:37:46,349
I don't think that's going to do it

1317
05:37:46,349 --> 05:37:48,840
It is

1318
05:37:48,840 --> 05:37:51,340
What?

1319
05:37:51,340 --> 05:37:53,340
You don't do like a hailstorm of punching if it's not correct

1320
05:37:53,340 --> 05:37:58,650
Why is there a bite mark on my arm?

1321
05:37:58,650 --> 05:38:04,479
Micro wall two

1322
05:38:04,479 --> 05:38:06,479
Unbelievable, the microbes are back

1323
05:38:06,479 --> 05:38:08,479
Can you believe it?

1324
05:38:08,479 --> 05:38:11,099
I already know the practice, I know how it works

1325
05:38:20,380 --> 05:39:32,250
I don't know how to fly

1326
05:39:32,250 --> 05:39:56,189
Is that enough to pass it?

1327
05:39:56,189 --> 05:39:59,000
He's so high

1328
05:39:59,000 --> 05:40:01,439
Good enough, okay

1329
05:40:01,439 --> 05:40:04,119
Whatever

1330
05:40:04,119 --> 05:40:06,119
I'm literally wearing jogging pants

1331
05:40:06,119 --> 05:40:08,430
There's no flight

1332
05:40:08,430 --> 05:40:10,430
What are you talking about?

1333
05:40:10,430 --> 05:40:12,430
For some research, this could be big

1334
05:40:12,430 --> 05:40:18,000
Oh no, packing pests too

1335
05:40:20,680 --> 05:40:28,680
We doped up on contrast

1336
05:40:28,680 --> 05:40:32,520
Okay, here we go

1337
05:40:32,520 --> 05:40:34,520
You still remember your training, right?

1338
05:40:34,520 --> 05:40:36,520
Sort of

1339
05:40:36,520 --> 05:40:48,750
I thought that wasn't a lot of practice

1340
05:40:48,750 --> 05:40:53,930
That's your punishment for not doing the Japanese audio

1341
05:40:53,930 --> 05:40:55,930
You want me to do Japanese audio?

1342
05:40:55,930 --> 05:40:59,000
Japanese audio?

1343
05:40:59,000 --> 05:41:08,479
That actually was an issue

1344
05:41:08,479 --> 05:41:10,479
It is, it is

1345
05:41:10,479 --> 05:41:12,479
Not bad

1346
05:41:12,479 --> 05:41:14,479
Alright, time to really see what you're made of

1347
05:41:14,479 --> 05:41:35,720
See what you can do with this new rhythm

1348
05:41:35,720 --> 05:41:40,009
Nicely done

1349
05:41:40,009 --> 05:41:42,009
Japanese audio is better for the love rap

1350
05:41:42,009 --> 05:41:44,009
I could see that

1351
05:41:44,009 --> 05:41:46,009
That would make sense

1352
05:41:46,009 --> 05:41:48,009
What happens when we give you an offbeat rhythm?

1353
05:41:48,009 --> 05:41:50,009
You watch out for the signal, you'll do fine

1354
05:42:24,439 --> 05:42:26,750
What was the one with the wubba lubba dub, is that true?

1355
05:42:26,750 --> 05:42:28,750
That's the wrestler one, we did it already

1356
05:42:28,750 --> 05:42:30,750
I wonder if there's a second part of it

1357
05:42:30,750 --> 05:42:34,970
I wonder, good luck with your overtime shift

1358
05:42:34,970 --> 05:42:38,560
On the ring side

1359
05:42:38,560 --> 05:43:54,139
Here we go

1360
05:43:54,139 --> 05:43:56,139
That's Gerba, they put Gerba in the game, it was Gerba

1361
05:43:56,139 --> 05:44:08,750
That's Gerba, that's Gerba 95, you ever heard of that guy?

1362
05:44:08,750 --> 05:44:10,750
Johnny Joe's intense training regimen continues

1363
05:44:10,750 --> 05:44:12,750
Can you help him reach the height of mastery?

1364
05:44:12,750 --> 05:44:15,119
No practice

1365
05:44:15,119 --> 05:44:18,889
This is going to be

1366
05:44:18,889 --> 05:44:21,520
Pretty hard

1367
05:44:21,520 --> 05:44:27,659
I would take a guess

1368
05:44:27,659 --> 05:44:41,419
Bring it on

1369
05:44:41,419 --> 05:44:43,419
And me got a problem at this point

1370
05:44:43,419 --> 05:44:45,419
Just like, that's bullshit

1371
05:44:45,419 --> 05:44:47,419
Be back here

1372
05:44:47,419 --> 05:44:49,419
It's just fucking

1373
05:44:49,419 --> 05:44:51,419
The console will never take off by the way

1374
05:44:51,419 --> 05:44:53,419
This console is going to be dead in the park, dead in the track

1375
05:44:53,419 --> 05:44:55,419
There's no way this console will take off

1376
05:44:55,419 --> 05:44:57,419
There's no way this console sells like

1377
05:44:57,419 --> 05:46:20,810
100 billion units

1378
05:47:08,939 --> 05:47:27,880
Nice throw, I didn't throw

1379
05:47:27,880 --> 05:47:29,880
I just didn't expect it

1380
05:47:29,880 --> 05:47:31,880
That was probably pretty good

1381
05:47:31,880 --> 05:47:33,880
You tried, and you still got it

1382
05:47:33,880 --> 05:47:37,150
Okay, whatever

1383
05:47:37,150 --> 05:47:40,479
It's just the end, I fucked it up

1384
05:47:40,479 --> 05:47:42,479
Let's focus my power and re-tie my belt

1385
05:47:42,479 --> 05:47:45,549
Okay, how many medals do I have?

1386
05:47:45,549 --> 05:47:47,549

This one will test you on everything you've learned

1390
05:47:54,240 --> 05:47:56,669
It's pretty tough

1391
05:47:56,669 --> 05:48:01,209

06:53:14,750 --> 06:53:17,310
money for lacquerie seriously even more stuff

1520
06:53:31,740 --> 06:53:55,099
all right nothing on tv today

1521
06:53:55,819 --> 06:54:14,680
sing now

1522
06:54:37,790 --> 06:54:41,310
you know when you sing along with the song and you have headphones in and you're the song is louder

1523
06:54:41,310 --> 06:54:45,150
than you are that's how you can tell if somebody can really sing it out because when they sing along

1524
06:54:45,630 --> 06:54:52,110
they're singing like they can't really realize that there are people you can't i can't hear

1525
06:54:52,110 --> 06:54:56,430
anything you know what i mean so when you sing along with a song that first of all like i'm

1526
06:54:56,430 --> 06:55:01,229
speech jamming myself with the song so when you sing along with a song if somebody has

1527
06:55:01,229 --> 06:55:06,669
the earphones in and the earphones are loud and they're singing along they typically sound like

1528
06:55:06,669 --> 06:55:11,069
you can tell if somebody can really sing enough because they they all right i know what i can't

1529
06:55:11,069 --> 06:55:18,040
explain this i could have but i can't all right when somebody has loud music playing and is

1530
06:55:18,040 --> 06:55:30,509
singing along to it somebody has loud music playing and is singing to it if they're singing very

1531
06:55:30,509 --> 06:55:36,919
poorly they don't know that they're singing poorly so you can hear all their voice practice

1532
06:55:36,919 --> 06:55:42,119
shit and they don't know that you can hear that for some reason i think i got it i feel like i was

bought that simulates probability it almost looked like roulette in a can with root with tiny rice

1649
07:32:21,130 --> 07:32:26,490
balls so you could pull it out and decide how many balls should be in it and then you went to a black

1650
07:32:26,490 --> 07:32:30,970
board to teach all of us about the math of probability so we had to get our notes out

1651

1672
07:35:05,180 --> 07:35:08,860
i feel i should let you know that two is actually three in the game story wise

1673
07:35:09,900 --> 07:35:16,299
there's a side game called misadventures of tron bone and it's 100 worth getting also mega man

1674
07:35:16,299 --> 07:35:21,580
legends was before they figured out lock on control so maybe a little clunky still great you can get

1675
07:35:21,580 --> 07:35:27,759
misadventures on the ps3 store for like five bucks yeah i i played mega man legends when it first

1676
07:35:27,759 --> 07:35:33,279

1696
07:38:11,819 --> 07:38:18,240

1697
07:38:18,240 --> 07:38:22,159

the great lord walden thanks for the 500 bits oh yeah they just say oh yeah thank you zake thanks

1701
07:38:42,750 --> 07:38:46,430
for the 250 yo merry christmas got a serious question for you what's the biggest difference

1702
07:38:46,430 --> 07:38:56,430
between streamer germa and real life jeremy tears from a land far far away huh not very much to be

1703
07:38:56,430 --> 07:39:08,889
honest i think the only difference really probably is and i'm going to be honest with you but real

1704
07:39:08,970 --> 07:39:16,840
life real life jeremy doesn't play video games like he used to if i play a game it's on stream

1705
07:39:16,840 --> 07:39:25,500
here with you guys i don't really do it upstream i sometimes maybe a little bit but i mean i the

1706
07:39:25,500 --> 07:39:33,240
streams are on for you know six to eight hours seven plus hours three or four times a week that's the

1707
07:39:33,240 --> 07:39:36,040
time that i'm gaming that's the time that i'm playing anything that i'm doing anything that

1708
07:39:36,040 --> 07:39:42,810
i normally would do when i'm not streaming i do very kind of boring stuff but i'll do i don't do

1709
07:39:42,810 --> 07:39:51,150
a whole lot it's almost like when when a stream is over and like for instance for today right let's

1710
07:39:51,150 --> 07:39:58,830
just give today as an example so i just played rhythm heaven for seven hours i typically would

1711
07:39:58,830 --> 07:40:05,310
play rhythm heaven for seven hours off stream on tuesday or something but i did it here instead

1712
07:40:06,639 --> 07:40:12,479
so the only difference is really just at least for gaming wise is the stream is on you know what i'm

1713
07:40:12,479 --> 07:40:22,459
saying so it's they happen at the same time like like it's sakiro came out right i wanted to play

1714
07:40:22,459 --> 07:40:27,450
sakiro i really wanted to play it i was super excited for it but i just played it on stream

1715
07:40:31,479 --> 07:40:35,799
and after you know it's been seven hours my goal right now is not oh i just played rhythm heaven

1716
07:40:35,799 --> 07:40:40,040
for seven hours i'm going to stop turn the stream off but i'm going to go turn on rhythm heaven

1717
07:40:40,040 --> 07:40:51,259
for like four more hours and that's just i wouldn't game that long anyways normally speaking are the

1718
07:40:51,259 --> 07:40:55,979
games that i prefer to play alone yeah i do there's this plenty of stuff that i've done

1719
07:40:55,979 --> 07:41:04,479
off stream that i didn't feel like doing on stream but it's very that's rare it doesn't happen that

1720
07:41:04,479 --> 07:41:14,220
much yeah that's there's your answer probably the main difference uh comes up thanks to the 250 this

1721
07:41:14,220 --> 07:41:17,419
is one of my favorite games ever and you're my favorite streamer ever glad you had fun with it

07:53:22,720 --> 07:53:28,000
programming to better teach them emotion they do their best yeah remember there's a lot of people

1809
07:53:28,000 --> 07:53:38,799
here at this stream this stream has a shitload of people on it but it's still it's still moderated

1810
07:53:38,799 --> 07:53:44,720
enough or we try to moderate it enough to not have you know spam or anything crazy or anything

1811
07:53:44,720 --> 07:53:51,360
fucking bad or people saying bad shit it's tough sometimes i mean there was seven thousand people

1812
07:53:51,360 --> 07:53:57,279
here today that's it's they're doing their best to manage it with the guidelines that are here

1813
07:53:57,680 --> 07:54:06,380
and i've talked about this before you you go wow no mods or mods or a really really really tightly

1814
07:54:06,380 --> 07:54:11,500
moderated stream but sub only always and a ton ton of rules that you have to follow or you're out

1815
07:54:11,500 --> 07:54:17,740
of here a lot of people do it like that or just open the floodgates and who gives a fuck i'm i

1816
07:54:17,740 --> 07:54:24,220
don't like that either so i try to keep it somewhere in the middle i try to it can be hard

1817
07:54:24,700 --> 07:54:32,520
it can be hard it's very difficult to have the level of freedom that i want

1818
07:54:33,479 --> 07:54:44,159
without it getting too over moderated or too under moderated it can be tricky sub only sucks

1819
07:54:44,159 --> 07:54:48,240
that's why i don't do with them i don't do sub only mode really ever only when i have to or

1820
07:54:48,240 --> 07:54:52,400
when something crazy is going on or if i want to avoid a spoiler for a game or something i don't
