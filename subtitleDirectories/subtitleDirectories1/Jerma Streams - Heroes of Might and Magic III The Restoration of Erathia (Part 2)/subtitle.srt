1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,940
Does anyone dare to challenge me? Figures. What is that? Rips the hilt of my...

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:23,739
Hey, how you doing everybody? Welcome. Welcome to the stream. Oh, gamer has logged in. On time.

3
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:30,859
Wait, what? Why do people get... why do people... residents sleep during when I'm on time?

4
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,810
Is it because you like hanging out in the chat so much and you like chatting without me here?

5
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:46,500
I can... I understand that. You're 15 minutes early. No, no, no, no. I am 15 minutes now.

6
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:55,939
It is now. There is no late. Between 3 and 4 p.m. There is only now. If it was 4 p.m. 401,

7
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:09,239
that's late. If it was 259, that's early. 3 to 4. Now. There is only late. All right,

8
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,640
give me one second. I'm gonna make a tweet and we're gonna talk about some stuff. We're

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,349
gonna go and let a little stuff talk. Not very long. Maybe like five minutes. Not even. Not

10
00:01:17,349 --> 00:02:37,210
even. All right. Okay, so I was talking with your mother last night and we have decided

11
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,289
that we're gonna bring this up in a respectful, nice way. We didn't want to, you know,

12
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:50,250
alarm you or anything, but your mother and I were cleaning up the house and we found

13
00:02:50,889 --> 00:03:00,180
a bag of marijuana and I know it's not mine. It's not hers and we've already talked to

14
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,740
Jacob about this. So we're just coming to you in hopes that you can maybe

15
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:26,870
shed some light on what this is. I learned it from watching you. Well, the character...

16
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,629
Listen, and this is tough. I know that, you know, you're 14 and it's tough to understand,

17
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:41,990
but that's a character that I play on television. The character, it's not real. I'm an actor

18
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:48,789
and I play a character that's... Think of it like recess. When I go out and I do recess

19
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:55,270
with other people doing recess and it's filmed and then it's put out as if it was real.

20
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,889
You know, my stoner personality that I put on that show is not something you should be doing.

21
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:10,150
He's RPing with chat. Yeah, what the fuck am I doing? I am like, we're just like role playing.

22
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:20,310
But how are you? Hope you're doing well. What we were really going to talk about

23
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:30,779
is today. What's happening today? Look, this is what's happening today.

24
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:38,310
Gonna do Might and Magic again. We're dialing it up to a million. We are going to do an

25
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:52,019
8v8v, no holds barred, large map. I ain't fucking around today. I've already picked

26
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:59,560
who and the music's not even on. What kind of streamer am I? Drop the house lights, please.

27
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:08,740
Thank you. And bring it up a little bit. There it is. So today we're going to... I've

28
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:17,430
decided I'm going to be green again. You guys aren't even dancing to this music. All you

29
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,759
can do is put your hands in the air and like move them like this. I can't fucking turn

30
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:29,399
the webcam on. My hands are in the air with my... Okay, I'm going to describe it. My thumb and my

31
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,720
middle finger are together on both hands. They're both in the air and I'm... Okay,

32
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,120
almost like I'm making like a kick the field goal here with my arms. And my hands are

33
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:49,639
swaying back and forth. Wrist turn in towards head. Wrist turns out towards the outside.

34
00:05:50,860 --> 00:06:03,560
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. Make the music louder. Why would I do that?

35
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:11,819
I should be dropping it. But I don't care. So we're going to do this today.

36
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,939
I'm... This is the last stream for a little while. For at least a couple days. Probably

37
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:23,939
three days. Because I have colonoscopy coming up here in a couple days. I'm kind of

38
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:29,240
foodless at the moment. Like I can't really eat that much. I can't eat anything tomorrow.

39
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,399
I have to not eat for 24 hours before the procedure. And I can't really eat that much

40
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:39,480
today. So I might lose a little bit of energy here. And when that happens, I'm

41
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:46,180
going to have to leave. So I'm going to go as long as I can with like no real energy.

42
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:56,459
What procedure? Colonoscopy. Colonoscopy. Yes, I can drink coffee. That is a thing.

43
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:03,399
I can have chicken broth, coffee, jello. And I think I can have like just nothing really

44
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:11,019
heavy. No high fats. I can't have anything with seeds in it. With skin. No berries. No

45
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:18,620
strawberries. No beans. Nothing like that. But we're gonna, we're just gonna go. So please

46
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:28,329
excuse my low energy here. No, I'll be fine. I'm like, please excuse my low energy.

47
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:36,019
It's like going into like work and talk to your boss. Excuse my low energy today. I've

48
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:46,250
got a colonoscopy in a couple days. It'll be good. But yeah, that's happening. This is

49
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,870
the last stream for a few days. And then let's go. Let's just go. I decided to pick. I know

50
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,790
you guys are looking at this going, Hey, what the hell? How come you, what I wanted to pick.

51
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:04,490
You should have let me pick. But I felt like going with a fortress. They looked pretty good.

52
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:17,139
No lizard man, serpent fly, Gorgons, Wyverns, Hydras. I like this. And of course I had to pick

53
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:27,139
Voi. Because Voi looks the most like Otto. This kind of looks like Otto in the morning when

54
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,180
he puts his head under the blanket. Districts like Otto too when he has his head under the

55
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:42,809
blanket in a different angle. All right, so we're gonna do, we're gonna start with

56
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:57,720
Wyston. No, not this guy. You want to be this guy? That's just like Vincent Van Gogh.

57
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:05,940
What is he doing here? You have all these monsters and actually, well, there's, there's another

58
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,340
person here. But I mean, like, why is Vincent Van Gogh in the middle of like two Ottos,

59
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:16,419
like dragons? It's the Burger King. It's not, uh, now you've said the fucking Burger King.

60
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:32,470
It's like young Prince Burger King. It's Burger, it's a young, it's Prince Burger King. All

61
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:39,320
right. It's a Beastmaster. I don't know what that even means. Everybody else who cares?

62
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:49,620
This is on the map Warlords. I have no idea how this is gonna play out. We're gonna

63
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,990
stay on the same difficulty. We're not gonna, we'll do 130%. Just a little bit on the higher

64
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:01,059
scale, but that's okay. That's what we do. The only way to lose is to lose everything.

65
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:10,889
The only way to win is to kill everybody. Can you turn off taxes? Uh, I don't think

66
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:31,899
this scenario does that. Battle Royale. Yeah, I think I'm ready to go. Are you ready? Wait!

67
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,200
Lower the difficulty? No, it's, it's okay. It's okay where it is. I just made some

68
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:52,870
mistakes. One. Three. Oh my god, this is gonna take forever. This is a huge fucking map.

69
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,649
And there are eight, there are seven people here. I do have the corner though. I'm in the

70
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:04,970
best spot I think. I really believe that. This is an 11 hour Simpson stream incoming.

71
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:13,700
No. Oh fuck. All right, what do I got? I got five, I got 15,000. Let's do this right.

72
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:20,659
Look at this place. I've never seen this before. Like a little swamp. All right,

73
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:28,870
Citadel. Town Hall. We want to get this immediately. So, Town Hall will give us a

74
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:39,700
thousand gold day. We want to get it immediately. Prepare to backseat. Backseat gamers.

75
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,659
Let's get these gnolls and let's go out. Let's get it. Just look at it. I'm going

76
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:52,179
to play this as to the book as possible. If there was an encyclopedia on how to play this

77
00:11:52,179 --> 00:12:03,500
game, I'm going to play it that way. I can't beat that guy. I'm just looking for a resource.

78
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:17,269
Lots of sprites. No. No resources right off the bat. There's a gate? Hold on, am I locked in my

79
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:34,789
own kingdom? Garrison. It's a garrison. Are you serious? I can leave people here?

80
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:42,940
This is unbelievably awesome. Wait, did I get a raid came in? Oh fuck, Jesus. I didn't even

81
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:51,639
see it. RT Gamecrowd came in with like a trillion people. Uh, thank you RT Gamecrowd

82
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:01,769
for the huge raid here. Welcome everybody. Hope you're having a good day. Hope your stream was

83
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:09,980
good. What were you playing? What was RT playing? And did they complete the game?

84
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:23,929
They're playing Nintendogs. How many dogs did he have? 50 dogs. All of them. Well, I hope

85
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:28,090
it was fun. Thank you so much for the raid. Welcome. A lot of you just came in. So,

86
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,980
we're playing. This is Heroes of Might and Magic and I'm going to win. I just started.

87
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,500
Get joined at a perfect fucking time. Let me tell you something. We've got the Burger King

88
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:44,389
Prince here. We've got our Gnolls here. I just started. I got a garrison here. What other things

89
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:47,269
can I point out that are just obvious if you're looking at the screen? I got a moat here.

90
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,649
Or a river. I've got a colon here. Got a colonoscopy here in a couple days.

91
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:58,919
That's what it's gonna look like. Let's go. But thanks again. Now he's doing- every time

92
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:05,639
a raid comes in, I gotta turn on like the YouTuber voice. Hey guys, welcome. Witch's Hut.

93
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,360
An ancient witch living in a strange hut welcomes you, teaching you pathfinding for her own

94
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:19,350
inscrutable purposes. That's actually really great. 25% less rough terrain penalty. I'll take

95
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:26,940
it. Of course I get a link to that. Do you guys just have that in a tab? How many of you

96
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:36,009
guys have that shit just in a tab waiting for like a reason to use it? Why have that just

97
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:41,659
ready to go in a tab? Lots of gargoyles. I can't beat them with these. All right,

98
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:48,919
swan pond. I need to see what's on the swan pond. But let's go back. We get gold a week here,

99
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:58,419
or every day. All right, we got the town hall. Citadel marketplace. I want a city hall.

100
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:03,820
So we need mage guild, marketplace, and a blacksmith. Of course we need the blacksmith.

101
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:13,399
So let's get that built. We're gonna go as fast as we can to get that 4,000 gold a day.

102
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:18,100
It's really important if you don't know what I'm talking about. When you get- when you

103
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,500
upgrade your city more than two or three times, you get to the maximum amount of

104
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:29,590
money. This is going to be the capital down here. You understand. All right, swan pond.

105
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:38,169
I got luck up. All right, don't be an idiot here. I don't want to be like a fucking idiot

106
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:43,509
here because the last time I spread the fuck out, mercenary camp. What's wrong with me?

107
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:59,350
That's all. I can only go that far. That's it. All right, well we need a marketplace

108
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,720
to get to the marketplace. While we have the wood, we're going to use it.

109
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:17,240
Okay, so should I go down or should I go up? Remember, there are seven other people here.

110
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:27,909
There are seven more fucking players. What do they- down? Up? I'm going to- the next

111
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:35,830
thing that somebody writes, I'm going to go down. Down, okay. Another colonoscopy here.

112
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:49,799
Log. Can I touch it? Pack of Cerberi. I don't think I want to fuck with that.

113
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:58,970
Finally, we get some treasure. I forget, at the beginning of the game, you can't move. You

114
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,909
move so slowly. All right, we can probably- now we can do- we need mage guild, and then we're

115
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:07,589
going to do upgrade that hall. I wasn't doing this. Remember last time, I was like, let's

116
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:19,380
make like a hundred gnolls. I'm gonna have four heroes. Always go with experience first.

117
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,930
Let's get that level up here. That treasure chest had advanced pathfinding and basic

118
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,470
ballistics. So this is a brewmaster? What do they do? A beast? What do they do?

119
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:38,579
What do they do? Specialty is Ballista. It increases the attack and defense skill of any

120
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:42,259
ballista for each level attained after fourth level, so I think we have to do ballistics.

121
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:49,289
Basic armor reduces all damage inflicted against the hero's troops by five percent.

122
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:56,299
Basic artillery gives control of the ballista to the hero. That's pretty awesome.

123
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:09,859
Uh, wait, don't I already have this though? You know what I mean? I like already have

124
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:17,079
this. Basic artillery, but- okay, but that's- okay. Yeah, let's do it. Oh, it's a catapult

125
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:24,339
versus ballista. I get it. All right. Nice. I have one for ballista, now I have one for

126
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:29,130
catapult. I have one for- yeah, they're different. Wait a minute, what are you doing F for?

127
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:38,250
What are you talking about? This is good shit. This is good shit! What are you talking

128
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:53,700
about? Let's look up here. All right, we got a crossroads. We got lots of dwarves,

129
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,859
and then a war machine factory. I'm gonna- well, this is just wrapping back the other way. Okay,

130
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:02,980
let's go back to town. There's not a whole lot of resources back here. There's this. I gotta

131
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:12,119
stock up enough. Let's get that, uh, let's get the city hall built. Now we got 2,000 gold a day,

132
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:19,900
and I think we're gonna do another hero now. I need a tavern for that though. We'll do

133
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:36,230
tavern next. I'm the king of the mud. War machine factory. Uh, there's no- none available.

134
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,099
I can't just- I could get this right now. This is the first day, 10th. I mean, I should just get

135
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:52,309
them. But I already have it. Well, I'll get these then. Might as well just fill the party up.

136
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,470
Yeah, okay. That's awesome. Nice. Sick. Fucking unbelievable. I'm doing so good.

137
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,809
Tavern. Is there a tavern here? Oh, there is a tavern. All right. Well, now I'm- oh,

138
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:17,140
that's another beastmaster. I don't want to do necromancer again. I did it last time,

139
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,980
and it didn't- I'm gonna do auto. Waking up in the morning under the blankets.

140
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:39,319
I don't want phant again. Phant sucked. No, I'm doing auto. What, if I don't hire him,

141
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,380
he's gonna end up on the other team somewhere? What are the chances to get phant again?

142
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,269
Yeah, he sucks. And plus, he's gonna ruin my whole thing here.

143
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:59,140
No, can I pay him a hundred bucks to, like, never come back? I'm going with, uh,

144
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm going with auto. Resurrect is good. No, I don't want him. He was bad luck charm last

145
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:12,890
time. My level four hero sucks at fighting level 17. My name- no, he was, like, level 19.

146
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:29,589
No, he's gone. You know, he's not leaving. He's like, can I please come? I'll sit here and as

147
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:41,769
long as it takes. All right, let's get you on a different path here. Two beastmas- specialty

148
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:55,269
wyverns. Nice. Basic scouting. Easy to see. One extra square. Cool. Okay. I wonder if we

149
00:21:55,269 --> 00:22:02,920
could take on the sprites. Who's my other guy down here? Let's look here. Is it an observatory?

150
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:18,339
Oh, now we can see. Hey, you're already coming down here? How does this guy have this much?

151
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:33,740
It's the first- it's the first week. That's not possible. Lizard den. I gotta build some of

152
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:40,730
these. He- I- he went all in on troops. What is this glyph of fear? Resource silo. All

153
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:53,910
right, I'm gonna get the lizard den out. Let's get some lizards. And you come on out.

154
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,019
Actually, no, you know, you can stay there. I don't- I- he's not gonna come over here.

155
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:06,490
That's, like, rough terrain. This is, uh, lots of dwarves. I don't- what is this? It's

156
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:18,460
like a lumber mill. Water wheel. 500 gold. That's not that good. All right, let's, uh,

157
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:27,619
let's go the next week. See what happens. He's fucking coming down here. Why is everybody

158
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:40,599
coming down here? Pack, pack, pack, few, several. He's already here. They're already encroaching

159
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:53,990
on my swamp. Serpent fly. Basilisk pit. So I need- I need- what do I need? A couple of wood.

160
00:23:53,990 --> 00:24:05,619
This is a marketplace. I need- I need- I need some wood. Let's go. I have lots of ore.

161
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:23,420
What do I need? Three? No, no, ten to one. Come on. Oh, this is bad. Well, I got 16, 14.

162
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,390
I could- I could go up here and maybe make a trade here. I gotta go up into the garrison

163
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:39,109
because I don't have any more troops. I don't- I can't even buy them. Lots of sprites. I wonder

164
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:44,380
if I can just kill this and take this all. There's so much wood over here. I'm gonna try

165
00:24:44,380 --> 00:25:03,049
it. I can do this. Oh, this is- I see. Sprite- I did- sprites are, like, the easiest

166
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:12,920
things. I didn't- I didn't know they were that weak. Well, I say that. All right,

167
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:22,250
we'll get this wood and I'll be able to get some more troops. All right, good. I lost

168
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:29,589
some gnolls, but it's okay. Oh my god, there's so much over here. Claim this. Ah, I'm so far

169
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:34,549
away. I can't- Look at all this stuff. He- He's gonna come down here and he's gonna kill me,

170
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:47,640
isn't he? I- I've got to go down. I'm gonna wrap around this way. Damn. I only have 24 gnolls.

171
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:54,630
I'm gonna hit the mercenary camp and I'm probably gonna die. The- The- Sneak King is

172
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:01,480
gonna die, like, today. Hope you guys are aware of this. It's a new week coming up.

173
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:15,430
Citadel Captain's Quarters. That's good. How many Captain's Quarters? It's just money.

174
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:29,529
We can do Citadel. Citadel is growth for everybody. Okay, let's just hope he doesn't

175
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:33,049
do anything. He's gonna- We're gonna fight and I'm gonna die. Say goodbye to the Sneak King.

176
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:49,990
No, he's just- Already has all this shit. I think I just lost. So it turns out being

177
00:26:49,990 --> 00:27:00,619
down in the swamp was not good. Um, I- Not yet. What is the biggest threat here? 13 to 10. He

178
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:09,180
just has- No, it's- I- I lose. He actually bought units. Well, because last time when I did that,

179
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:15,539
it- It snowballed me into not being able to do anything. I tried to, like, upgrade the

180
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:20,099
capital first because I figured with a huge map, I wasn't gonna get attacked in the first

181
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:48,019
month. It's not over yet. 10, 20. Oh, it's definitely over. Ah, I wish I had anything.

182
00:27:52,569 --> 00:28:04,740
End of the- End of the mudshire. I mean, hold on. Hold on, though. It's not over yet.

183
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:24,869
Come on! It's not over yet. It's not over yet. No. Holy shit, I might actually win. No,

184
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:44,380
I won't. No, there's too many. I forgot about this guy. Well, I tried just making

185
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:50,299
a bunch of monsters last time, and I- And nobody attacked me for six months. And then I went- Let

186
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,980
me try to get, like, money first. Let me, like, tech first. No, I'm attacked in the first, like,

187
00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:06,329
two weeks. He's gonna take all this stuff. Oh my fucking god. He didn't get it all.

188
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:19,059
Come on, a second. I might really get revenge here. Where the hell am I going?

189
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:35,819
I can't afford it. Buy a hero- Yeah, buy a hero, stack with units, then send out.

190
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:40,359
That's what I did last time. It's not over yet. I'm- No, it's not over yet. Not yet.

191
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:59,930
Witch or cleric? Probably witch. I can get my revenge here.

192
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:19,220
Okay, it's not over. 35, 13, 4. I got him up here. He's got 24. There's nobody in this garrison.

193
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:30,710
He's gonna get this materials up down here. Yeah, I made it, okay. Now the question is,

194
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:39,589
can I get far enough where I can meet you up here? Oh, am I one fucking pixel away?

195
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:59,079
Come on. I can do it. Oh, no! Attack him? No, I can't. Not yet. I want those gnolls.

196
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:09,980
He took everything. Oh, it was a bad fucking start. Because he still has the-

197
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:29,579
All right, fucking get rid of him. Because he still has this shit. Like,

198
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,940
the- these guys- he has, like, more than I do. All right, it's time to win.

199
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:54,680
Magic arrow. We're gonna deal with you. Fly over here. He took all that stuff. Like,

200
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:01,529
what are you even doing down here? This is like- this map is huge. Last night,

201
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:06,859
we didn't see a monster. We didn't see another person for two to three straight months.

202
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:16,859
Bullshit. What's going on? Why am I- Oh, what? Okay, I can control them because of the-

203
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:32,259
I get it, right. I kind of have to go back. It's because it was water. All right,

204
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:45,450
that makes sense. I can't shoot anybody. You really don't like that tent, do you?

205
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:15,880
Bug on bug action. Is that an oof? All right, gnolls are gonna be so heavy this game. It's

206
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,779
not over yet. I just got kind of, like, fucked over in the beginning. It's okay. Don't

207
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:35,140
worry. We're gonna be fine. I'll get really good experience by doing this.

208
00:33:35,140 --> 00:34:14,150
All the experience he just stole from me? I'm about to get it right back. Don't let

209
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:25,030
him run. I'm trying to get the gnoll up there. There he goes, dead. No running for you,

210
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:33,510
900 experience. All right, now I get the wood and I get the learning stone. Okay.

211
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,500
I- God damn it. I can't believe he came in immediately and just took all my shit.

212
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:48,869
I'm so irritated about that. Allows your hero to learn fourth level spells or eagle eye.

213
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:04,940
I'm so fucking, like, irritated. I wonder if it should be- probably wisdom. Give me this

214
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,820
back. One of you take it. All right, now everything's okay again. There is another

215
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:16,730
person that's over here. There is- okay, what do you got? We got lots of skeleton warriors.

216
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:26,039
There's a lot of stuff up there. Lou, what do you got? Oh, you got nothing. See,

217
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,519
like, why could I be over here where he is? He's got a pack of, like, rats and that's

218
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:35,820
it. Of course, the one dickhead that stacked minions, like, ran straight down.

219
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:46,599
All right, uh, let's go back to the castle. I got zero idea. Okay.

220
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:54,070
Uh, glyphs of fear, captain's quarters. Might as well just make it just because

221
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,690
get those extra gnolls and then next week I'm gonna get the fly den. What does it cost?

222
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:14,090
Serpent fly. I need five wood. I have the rest. I gotta work on wood. All right,

223
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,769
you don't have anybody. You gotta go back here and we're gonna claim this, too.

224
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:30,010
Lots of halberds. They're hard, though. Where are you right now? See, like, he has, like, a pack

225
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:37,579
several. Where's he going? Down the sanctuary? Okay, well, that's all done. I got that

226
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:49,099
claimed. You go in here. Okay, I can't do any of this. I need that wood. I'm gonna get,

227
00:36:49,099 --> 00:37:02,630
what, one a day? Two a day? Don't have enough to do anything. I need 50 and 12. I

228
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:07,750
think I can go out with her. 50 gnolls is a lot of gnolls. I should be okay. In fact,

229
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:30,340
I wonder if the gnolls can take on the halberds. Holy shit, this nine, those nine wood. He missed

230
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:37,670
it. I thought he got everything. Oh, wow. Thank heavens. Serpent fly hive. And I should

231
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,829
do the gnoll hut. Upgrade the gnoll hut and get super gnolls. No, what do I do? Super,

232
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:51,659
no. I think I'm just going straight up with extra super gnolls and then I'm gonna transfer

233
00:37:51,659 --> 00:38:13,900
them into super gnolls and then go up. All right, come back here. Oh my goodness. Everybody's

234
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:19,340
like all over the place now. I want these 50 gnolls to be super gnolls. Out of the way.

235
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:32,340
Bingo. Gnoll Marauders. What's the difference to you? Three, five, two to three, six.

236
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:38,980
Two to three, six, five. Two to three, six, four. A higher defense, higher attack skill. Yeah,

237
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:51,050
they're just better. Now, better lizards? What do you think? Should I just go straight up

238
00:38:51,050 --> 00:39:03,940
better lizards? I wonder if I should do that right now. Yep. This is, this is good now. This

239
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:12,710
is really good. Lizard warriors, lizard men. Two to three. Okay, hold on. Five, six. They do

240
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:21,190
12 shots. Six, eight, 24, two to five, 15, 14. Better speed. All right. Looking good so far.

241
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,409
I think it's time to just, I'm gonna, I think I can take these, uh, Halliburters.

242
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,460
Maybe I should wait till next week and get a fully upgraded because you're,

243
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:48,889
he's just not doing shit in here, is he? I'm thinking of just waiting to next week,

244
00:39:48,889 --> 00:40:03,639
get a good pack and then bring it up. The plan doesn't change here. You know what I mean?

245
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:10,980
I don't think I should change the plan. So capital needs castle. So I need 10 wood.

246
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:15,369
I need serpents. So I need five wood before the end of this week.

247
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,900
All right. Do you think, should I go after the Halliburters with my 50 gnolls and 12,

248
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:37,510
lizard warriors? Wait, just in case something fucking really bad happens.

249
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:56,469
I just, that just gets this shit out of me. Conquerors. I got this. It's gonna take me

250
00:40:56,469 --> 00:41:08,710
forever to get here. Let's do haste. Bloodlust. Bloodlust on, uh, I think I'm gonna think

251
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:27,940
bloodlust on you. Bang. Nice. I don't want, nobody die. Nobody die. Three dead. You gotta

252
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:36,280
go twice. All right. Yes. And I get this right here too. Oh, I'm so fucking happy.

253
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,739
Knowledge plus one level three. Advanced first aid gives control of the first eight,

254
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:45,420
10 to the hero, healing 75 points of damage to the first unit of the selected stack

255
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:59,909
or basic water magic. 75 points of damage. I feel like I would want the water, but

256
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:11,510
that's it. 75 health is a lot. Look at all this. Nine ore, five ore, five ore.

257
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:19,159
There's so much over here. Beautiful. All right, I got another couple days before.

258
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:28,059
I need, uh, let's go in here. I need, what the fuck do I need? Five wood. What do I have now?

259
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:42,619
Two. Got a couple days left. All right, let's grab that. Six. Claim this. I couldn't touch it.

260
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,260
All that wood gone, but it did help a lot. Okay, so now I've got two a day over here

261
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:53,769
and it's all the way down in my swamp. Seems pretty good. All right, we're almost there. I

262
00:42:53,769 --> 00:43:06,170
need one more wood, which will, I can get it tomorrow. That will bring me to serpents. Oh,

263
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:23,289
I should get this. One wooden one ore a day. That's amazing. Cage of warlords.

264
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:31,909
Shipyard. I can buy boats from here. All right, let's get that serpent flyhive next

265
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,190
and then I'll show, I have a good army and I'm going to go take them out.

266
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:39,880
One of my thoughts in the game so far is game is phenomenal. It's absolutely fantastic.

267
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:46,280
Okay, so let's bring you back. It's almost time for a new week.

268
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:12,329
Flyhive. Get it. I am now, I'm now available. Hold on. What about tomorrow? Growth is in coming

269
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:24,389
tomorrow. Flyhive. I can't do it. I can do it tomorrow. I can do superflies tomorrow. Next,

270
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:30,230
it's first week. Second week. Here we go. Superflies. Get it all. I'm going for it. Watch

271
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:44,650
this. And then this, this hero is going out. You leave for a moment. Do I have to back up?

272
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:55,139
Can we not both fit on the road? Oh, this is going to be awesome. All right, here we go.

273
00:44:55,139 --> 00:45:04,809
Ready? I am ready to take a large army up. Upgrade the, or should I get basilisks right

274
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:24,059
now? Which one? Basilisks or better flies? Basilisks may be this strong. Am I not going

275
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:37,159
to have enough money to do this all? I don't know what to do. I'm going to go with the flies

276
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:52,860
because now they're superflies and I can get 20 of these. I don't have enough money. I can wait.

277
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:57,099
We'll do it tomorrow. I need to get money. Go get money. You just go buy stuff.

278
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:11,460
Who cares if this guy dies? Who cares? Scout, get out here. Go adventure. Go claim

279
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:24,420
something. You're giving me fucking diarrhea. Like go claim this. Oh, I could kill this guy.

280
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:44,199
I could kill this guy right now. Get this tomorrow. How are we doing? More. This is damn

281
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:49,670
good army. All right. I'm going to, I think I'm going to go with this. What do you think?

282
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,099
This is, this is a damn good army. 43, 12. This is damn good. I could kill this guy.

283
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:03,980
One more day and that's it. Last day. That's it. That's it. No more. No more.

284
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,699
I don't care what happens. Oh fuck. He's going to kill me. No, he's not. I'm going

285
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:25,769
to kill him right now. Right into my trap. Okay. Come on. Come on. What do I need? I could

286
00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:33,340
do. Oh, God damn it. All right. I'm going up. I'm going up. I'm going up. I'm going up. I have a lot.

287
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:46,809
I can get rid of orange right now. I'm going in here. He's blocking the gate. He's going to

288
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:52,409
die, but it's okay. Look at this crew. This is a really good first month, second month crew.

289
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,159
He's scared. He ain't fucking going to handle this. I'm going to kill him. He's dead.

290
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:20,219
Let's start clearing shit. You can take the next stack of people. Where am I? Oh,

291
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:25,780
right here. All right. We're going this way. I've got a lot of good troops.

292
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:32,599
I'm going to head out towards the witch's hut here. I got basic pathfinding. Good

293
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:42,619
mercenary camp plus one attack. You're in big trouble and then I'm going to claim

294
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,309
this. We'll get the we'll get through this and I'm going to go down. I'm going to

295
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:55,539
grab this. There's a harpy loft over there. I've got a plan. I think it's a decent plan.

296
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:03,610
Let me get the basilisk thing opened and upgraded. Basilisk pit. Make it. There it is.

297
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:09,940
Four basilisks are available. We let them hang out. We don't have to do anything about this.

298
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:25,369
This is your team. Now you die. What about the dwarves? What is it? Lots of dwarves.

299
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:40,699
I can handle it. I want this sulfur pit. Oh yes. I did. Sometimes you just have to go

300
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:50,090
for it because they don't want to fight you. 35 dwarves. Now you actually are dead. You

301
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:55,940
can't be scared. Sometimes you just got to go for it. You ain't going to get out of here.

302
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:03,460
Head in here. Let's get you in the building. Get you some troops just in case something bad

303
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,710
happens. We've got four baskets on you now. What else can I buy here? Nothing. I've got no

304
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:22,420
money. Here we go. Really? Really? Time to die. In fact, I can just bring the serpent

305
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:35,980
straight in and just murder you. Let's go bloodlust on the serpents. The serpents are going right

306
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:54,260
for the jesters. Infecting everybody. I love it. Okay, let's move. You got to start moving

307
00:50:54,260 --> 00:51:01,500
down here. I wonder who's my more priority. Probably the gargoyles because they can move

308
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:25,690
really fast. Get those dwarves up there. All right. Gargoyles. Dead. Let's go for the

309
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:32,139
golems. They're the most dangerous. Fine. Bring it up to the nose. That was a mistake. You

310
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:39,610
shouldn't have done that. He's gone. I didn't lose very much and I got a bunch of experience

311
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:53,530
and he's out of here. Let's claim this all. Back to the building. How are we doing? Okay.

312
00:51:53,530 --> 00:52:00,309
Got more. What do we want to build? Glyphs of fear plus two to a garrison's hero defense

313
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:05,030
when defending. I can upgrade the pit next. I just need money. We're going to get the glyph

314
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:23,820
just to get it. All right. Here comes somebody else. Who is that? That is blue.

315
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:29,739
Several pack, few. You're dead. Oh, this feels good to be powerful. It feels good to have like

316
00:52:29,739 --> 00:52:35,059
power. Lots of stone golems. I mean, we're going to meet you halfway here. You're in

317
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:46,699
trouble. Get out of my territory. I told you it wasn't over. No, it's not over. Restart,

318
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:54,900
restart. No, no. You got to push through sometimes. Blood obelisk. Cage of warlords.

319
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:09,289
Upgrade basilisk pit. Now we have greater basilisks. Six to ten and five. Six to ten

320
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:19,610
forty. And they're faster. Now the pit has eyes. Yeah, that's fucking weird.

321
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:31,449
Okay. Continue. Where are you going? You're going all the way down here. What are you

322
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:41,579
doing, man? Are you just like, are you just asking to die? All dwellings increase population.

323
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,460
I don't think I even need, I don't think I even have to go down there.

324
00:53:51,400 --> 00:54:00,940
I'm coming out because guess what? I got nine basilisks and he's not going to take this.

325
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,489
Maybe I should just follow him down here. Yeah, let's, I'm, no, you're not taking

326
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:27,300
this all from me. Well, now you trapped yourself, but I'll take it back and I'm

327
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:42,739
going to block the road. Good luck. Pink is dead. Pink has been vanquished. There are seven who

328
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:58,940
remain. Same deal. Bloodlust on, bloodlust on the archers. And then we got here. Anybody,

329
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:07,739
I don't think Hayden has any ranged. I think I should probably go for the wolf riders.

330
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:26,340
Now bloodlust is melee. Fuck. It's only melee. Damn it. I'm going in for wolf riders. I'm

331
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:38,519
going to feel like killing in one hit. Yeah. I mean, you just, you don't stand any chance.

332
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:53,500
Why would you throw it at him? Yeah. You're more of an immediate threat.

333
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:04,489
Enemy ran away out of my territory and look where we are down here and I can go down here

334
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:12,710
and I can stock up again. I'm going to be fucking pretty damn unstoppable. Look at this.

335
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:35,860
Mm hmm. Pull him out. Actually, I can just trade them. So, hey, come here. You're going to have

336
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:42,099
13 more of these, 12 more of these, 33 more of these. And actually I'll give you one dwarf.

337
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:58,179
How does that sound? All right. Back in here. You and the one dwarf. Now that's an army.

338
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:05,820
Oh yeah. Give me the other stuff too. Give me like, give me like literally just,

339
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:12,539
I'm just going to strip you. Give me, uh, give me this shit. Give me this,

340
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:29,670
give me this. I already have one of those. You have any artifacts? Get back in here.

341
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:39,050
Good. Now it's time to go up and I now have basilisks. Good to go. This is a huge army.

342
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:45,800
Now I get to go wherever I please. I've already got this claimed. I'm going to go right.

343
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,400
Nobody is over here. Now I'm going to go down. I'm going to go down and go up. Let's

344
00:57:49,400 --> 00:58:05,340
get rid of these gargoyles. Move on from here. Don't pursue. Let him run.

345
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:21,429
Sulfur. Plus two luck. And pond. A pack of Cerberi. Now that might not be something I want to do.

346
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:43,579
I wonder if it's something I should try. Don't engage. Now this is a harpy loft.

347
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:57,019
Yep. I just have more units. It's time to begin conquering. Wait, let's get back to the

348
00:58:57,019 --> 00:59:02,789
castle. Let's get some more of these units just in case something fucking bad happens.

349
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:15,139
Lud obelisk, cage of warlords, wyvern nest, gorgon lair. Let's do gorgon lair. We'll get the growth,

350
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:22,409
double growth from gorgons. And remember, we're just, we're stashing here with this guy.

351
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:33,619
Until I get another castle, I am stashing. New week. All populations have doubled. Now

352
00:59:33,619 --> 00:59:37,780
you're over here. What are you looking at? There's a blue over here somewhere.

353
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,820
Where's that blue guy? Right here? Okay, you really, what do you got?

354
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:50,900
Pack. You. Lots. Bored. Lots. Pretty dangerous. But I'll be okay.

355
00:59:51,699 --> 00:59:58,260
Let's head up this way. Make sure to go down. Let's go through the stone golems.

356
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:08,070
Don't pursue. Let him run. Cliff nest. The cliff nest is guarded by several rocks. Do you

357
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:17,369
wish to fight the guards? Rocks. Is it, am I gonna get griffins? All right, this is,

358
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:32,179
all right, hold on here. Um, magic arrow. Haste. Bloodlust on, bloodlust on the dragonflies.

359
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:46,090
Just get him in. Or haste on the dragonflies. Wait for him to come to you. Um, I think he

360
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:50,360
can make it across the whole thing, can he? Or haste on the archers. That's not a bad idea.

361
01:00:53,210 --> 01:01:06,630
Haste on archers. So maybe I should just wait, because I think he can fly all the way

362
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:25,690
across. Yeah, I'll wait. I'm gonna put the basilisks. They have 60 health each.

363
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:41,400
I'm putting basilisk in front of archers. Block archers. Get the dwarves in front of

364
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:47,610
the archers. Just make it try to get, no, no, don't, don't do that much. Should I just

365
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:56,250
put every hex? Here we go, look at this. Here he comes! All right, he still has to come to us.

366
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:04,380
Uh, haste the archers again, but bloodlust, I'm bloodlust on the, uh, on the gargoyles.

367
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:13,219
And then I'm going in. Wait, don't haste the archers. Increase the speed of the selected

368
01:02:13,219 --> 01:02:16,340
unit. Everybody, people were telling me that was a good idea. Was that not a good idea?

369
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,739
Haste is just movement. Oh, was I getting baited? Everyone was like, haste the archers,

370
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:26,469
haste the archers. Speed is just movement time. Then I thought maybe it was turns as

371
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:40,579
well. All right, I'm going to bloodlust on the basilisk. And where, we're going in. Get in there.

372
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:58,780
Over the gnolls. Basilisk, bloodlust. Bang. He's only got one more. One more hit. Nice. I lost

373
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:10,550
it a little bit, but not, that was, that was. Okay, here we go. Expert first aid. A hundred

374
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:16,730
points of damage to the first unit of the selected stack. Or should I get earth magic?

375
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:24,309
Yeah, first aid, unless you have, here's how first aid is good. Because remember, it's to the first

376
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:29,699
unit of the stack. So if you have, let's say, for instance, like a dragon or something,

377
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:36,539
something that has more than a hundred health, you know, if a dragon has 150 health, then

378
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:40,780
right, you just do that. But I don't have anything like that yet. Let's do earth magic.

379
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:56,300
This is a pretty stacked party right now. It just is. So, I mean, I could meet you here.

380
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:08,949
This would be a fight, but he wouldn't take the castle. I'd probably win. Where do I go down?

381
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:17,260
I don't have, I used all that money. I don't have any more money to do this.

382
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:32,389
I can't really do it yet. I wonder, I don't know if he's gonna come down. Okay, if he

383
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:41,510
comes down here, then I start to change my strategy. Because I don't think he even knows

384
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:51,380
this exists down here. Should I pull back and go on defense? Well, we'll have to find out.

385
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:55,719
We'll see what he does this week. There he goes. Okay. He's not coming down here.

386
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:14,329
Up or down? I'm gonna say down. Nothing in here. Okay. Let's take it slow here.

387
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:33,260
How do I get in there? I think I can get in there from here. Look at this down here.

388
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:42,139
There's like a little slot down there. Go back. Let's check on, I'm just gonna,

389
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,860
I'm building, you know, I'm just gonna build, upgrade the Gorgon lair.

390
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:50,460
And then now look at this. I can get upgraded Gorgons. What do they turn into?

391
01:05:51,340 --> 01:06:02,969
Are they throwing up? Why is he puking? Why is he just throwing up? 10, 14, 12 to 16,

392
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:11,349
12 to 16. Same damage, same health, but higher defense and a little bit faster.

393
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:24,760
Can move further. When I get the money, I felt like somebody was just going to just drive into

394
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,440
the house. Like I really felt like somebody was going into the window. Like I thought

395
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,760
that was somebody in a little drone flying and crashing into my window. That just scared

396
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:42,860
the shit out of me. That was in the house. Yeah. That sounded fake. Somebody's in a pod racer out

397
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:51,590
here. That was a Star Wars fucking pod racer. That wasn't even a car. Yeah, it really was.

398
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,820
Just waiting for the guy to yell out outside his fucking car.

399
01:07:04,389 --> 01:07:28,550
Oh no. All right. Stick to the plan. I'm going back this way. I need to get this

400
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:32,630
so much treasure under there. I'm taking a risk and see if it pays off. Any more of these? Let's

401
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:37,139
check. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me just get this. Are there any more in here?

402
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:46,469
No, I didn't know if it maybe this. I don't know. Go down. Come on. Come on. Make this

403
01:07:46,469 --> 01:07:50,150
worth it. Make it worth it. The hat. It's got to be like a little path down here. Make

404
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:54,630
it worth it. Please. There is, but there's like fucking magma elementals. I don't think

405
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:57,510
I can go through here. Should I do this? There's a lot of treasure over here.

406
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:17,529
Somebody's coming. Pack lots, few, several, several. This'll be a fight. But what if they,

407
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:44,149
but what if they're, they want to join us? Um, okay. But, but what do I do? I have too

408
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:52,760
many people. Harpies? Harpies are out of here. Trade Harpies for magma elementals.

409
01:08:52,760 --> 01:09:12,739
I spent like a thousand bucks on these though. Six to ten. Holy fuck. Oh yeah.

410
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:17,289
What about the Dwarves? The Dwarves are kind of terrible though. They haven't done anything.

411
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:23,130
They just stood around. They just watched the fight. Six. So seven and eight. Six and five.

412
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:30,619
Now they're better. Yeah, there's a lot of them. Yeah. Okay. That's it. That's,

413
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:37,289
holy shit, man. Sometimes you got to go for it. And now I got a ton of stuff down here. 500

414
01:09:37,289 --> 01:09:44,340
gold. I'm thinking I buy, I'm, I'm thinking to take the money because then I can buy every

415
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:56,300
unit. Someone's coming down here. It's always experience. Yeah. Level five. Expert. Wisdom.

416
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:04,390
Basic navigation. Chris, you're here as movement points at C by 50% or fifth level spells. But I

417
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:13,260
don't have a mage tower. And then we get to go this way. Look at this little fucking secret.

418
01:10:13,819 --> 01:10:23,819
I'm gonna head back here. Upgrade these guys. How much can I pull out? A pretty substantial

419
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:37,380
amount of people. There's still one dwarf here. I mean, this is a decent army. What the hell is

420
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:53,529
that? I tried to click it. He's taking my shit. Dragon wing tavern. This item increases

421
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:58,840
your knowledge and power skills by plus two. This guy scares me. He's coming. He's wrapping

422
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:04,680
around. It might be time to, but I want to go over here and see what I want to get all

423
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:13,659
this stuff. Look at all this stuff. I can go back and just stack and have so many.

424
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,340
Should I, but, but he's gonna come down here and take all this stuff.

425
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:32,739
The stuff's not gonna go anywhere. But I have to go all the way around. He's gonna get there

426
01:11:32,739 --> 01:11:46,069
before I do. Lots of griffins blocking the way here. I'm going for greed. I'm going for

427
01:11:46,069 --> 01:12:03,739
greed. I am. I'm sorry, guys. I got plenty of growth. Holy shit. Pack of dragonflies.

428
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,800
You want to join me? I'll let you. You can join me if you want.

429
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,460
Odd by the power of your forces begin to scatter.

430
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:44,619
Water elemental conflux? Uh, oh, these things are so good, but I don't have enough room.

431
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:56,149
Look at all this. It's so wonderful. This is so much. Lots of, okay, this royal griffins

432
01:12:56,149 --> 01:13:04,119
guarding. This like mini boss and then actual boss. So I gotta be careful down here.

433
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:16,420
Delete the dwarves. Delete the dwarves. Just get another hero. All right, I'm gonna get another

434
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:22,300
hero and I'm gonna walk up over here. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm getting a

435
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:28,539
little overwhelmed. I'm not gonna lie. I'm getting kind of overwhelmed. Um, what, hold on. I need

436
01:13:28,539 --> 01:13:39,539
a capital. I need a castle. I need 5,000 gold. Let me just get to, hold on. I'm overwhelming

437
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:46,710
myself. I need the money. I need the, I'm so, look at how much I have. 100 fucking ore,

438
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:50,310
30. I'm so stacked on resources this game, but I don't have any money.

439
01:13:50,310 --> 01:14:02,149
Let me just fill it up. All right, he's not coming this way. He's not coming this way.

440
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:06,810
Oh, look at all this stuff. Always experience or should I take the money?

441
01:14:07,529 --> 01:14:37,000
Free. XP is priceless. I know it is. Money. Money for the army. I'm getting greedy.

442
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:49,579
Basic sorcery. Expert first aid. Level six. And there's all this up here. I wonder if I can

443
01:14:49,579 --> 01:14:58,789
take some of this. Five percent more damage. I'll take it. Nothing else this way. I got

444
01:14:58,789 --> 01:15:11,369
mercenary camp plus one attack. Head back here. What do we got? Castle. I need 5,000 gold.

445
01:15:13,939 --> 01:15:20,100
Get plenty of units stacked up. I'm gonna save. I'm not gonna spend any money.

446
01:15:20,819 --> 01:15:29,369
We're good. Now here's the thing. A pack of pit lords. I can definitely take them.

447
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:44,090
There's only a pack and it's a fucking gold mine behind them. They're dangerous. They have a lot

448
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:57,880
of health. They have a lot of damage. They do not have any ranged. I'm thinking just magic

449
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:08,220
arrow. Protection from fire. That makes no... I think I'm just gonna have to zap.

450
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:16,939
Okay. Don't go anywhere. They're probably slow. What's their speed? Seven. They can go far.

451
01:16:17,659 --> 01:16:22,409
I think they can fly. Just hold back. Hold back. I just want to say I need to see.

452
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:29,779
I've got my own like shitty version of them. I have my like bargain bin knockoff version

453
01:16:29,779 --> 01:16:58,359
of these guys. Nobody move. Nobody do anything stupid. Send the dwarves in. Fuck them. They

454
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:12,010
got whips. All right. Now I've got an opportunity to dwarf. Bloodlust the dwarves or just zap them.

455
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:18,300
Just get rid of the stack up here. I think I'm gonna zap and just continue to fight.

456
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:27,529
Give the dwarves haste. Now zap. Let's take it down four. That's perfect. All right. I think

457
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:35,699
it's time to go in. No. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Don't go in. Not you. No. He can

458
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:40,520
make it. I didn't think he could make it all the way. All right. We gotta... It's time to go.

459
01:17:43,670 --> 01:18:00,500
Kill him. Dead. Stay here. What the fuck did he just do? Why is he... What did he turn into?

460
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:18,039
He turned into like a... He re-transformed or something? All right. Dwarves. I can't get up

461
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:22,840
there. They're gonna have... They'll kill it eventually. What does it do? Can I see the

462
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:32,090
stats? It's just a kind of a shittier version. That's okay. Summon demons from dead ally.

463
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:41,319
But... Oh, he's doing it. So he's casting it on that dead body. Okay. So he needs to die.

464
01:18:42,680 --> 01:19:12,489
Like now. Send in the fucking dwarves. Fast lift to get in. If I kill this, will he revive it?

465
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:27,689
Or can he only... How many times can he do that? Good. Okay. I'm gonna give bloodlust

466
01:19:27,689 --> 01:19:36,630
to the dwarves. They're gonna show their worth. Keep the... Actually, he's blocked it right

467
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:45,020
now. I'm not gonna stay where I am. Everybody else is gonna have to move. It's gonna... You

468
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:58,199
have to do the bath list. You just have to kill. Go on, dwarves. Nice. Surround him. Nice.

469
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:08,520
One more. You got to go twice. Kill him. Thousand experience. I had some blouses,

470
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:16,949
but it's okay. We have a gold mine now. This is a thousand gold a day. And I get

471
01:20:16,949 --> 01:20:27,699
plus one attack. It was a little sloppy, but it's all right. Now I wonder. A lot of centaur

472
01:20:27,699 --> 01:20:36,260
captains. I probably can get in. I can probably do this too. We can replace the gnolls with the

473
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:48,300
elementals. Either that or we stack. Okay. Let's do what I was gonna do. Castle

474
01:20:49,020 --> 01:21:06,140
and then capital. Capital's next. Maybe I should... I think it's time to maybe head back

475
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:10,140
because I don't know if it's gonna be possible for me to do this.

476
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:21,210
Lots of captains and lots of griffins, but I mean... Can I get that wood here? I don't

477
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:33,479
think I can get through this. I'm not sure. The royal griffin. Lots of royal griffins.

478
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:41,270
I mean, this could just be like... I got plenty of stuff. Hold on. We're gonna just do this.

479
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:54,250
I'm gonna trade the gnolls for the elementals because, I mean,

480
01:21:54,250 --> 01:22:03,619
they're not doing anything for me right now. What's worse? 27 dwarves or 15 gnolls?

481
01:22:04,859 --> 01:22:11,510
6-7 defense. 8-8. 2-4. 2-3. 20 health. No, these things suck.

482
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:27,670
Yeah. We're gonna replace. We're gonna get six water elementals. 3-7. These things aren't that

483
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:32,420
much better though. They actually aren't very good. It's not worth 1,800 bucks.

484
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:42,579
No, it's not worth it. It's not worth it. I can stack the gnolls. Yeah, that's true.

485
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:52,380
I saved it right before that, right? Like, I saved it literally right before making that

486
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:59,880
turn, right? Because that's a waste of a turn. I did, right? Yeah. I mean, that was just a waste.

487
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:12,090
Okay. Here we go. I already got the plus attack. Let's see if I can get through here.

488
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:21,050
Do not engage. Yes! I get the two wood a day. Should I go for the... Look at this. Should I

489
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:41,750
go for it? Should I go for it? I'm going for it. Oh, man. 14. They're not scary at all.

490
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:45,989
I thought they... Royal Griffins. All right. I thought they were going to be insane.

491
01:23:46,869 --> 01:23:57,420
Please. This is gonna be easy. I was scared for nothing. All right. I'm gonna give...

492
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:05,739
I'm gonna give bloodlust to the basilisks or the... Maybe the magma elementals.

493
01:24:06,619 --> 01:24:14,520
No, the basilisks. Or the brux. Check out their abilities. Unlimited retaliations.

494
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:27,930
So that means that they will attack back every single time. Haste the archer. Yeah. All right.

495
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:34,250
I'm gonna defend. I'm gonna bloodlust. I'm gonna haste the dwarves, right? And just send them

496
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:44,550
out there. Fuck them. Haste the dwarves? Just get them out there? Yeah. You defend.

497
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:51,109
Basilisks, I'm gonna stick them right here. They're not gonna move because I think they

498
01:24:51,109 --> 01:24:58,789
have to go. And the magma... Get the magma out there too. Yeah. Step it out a little bit.

499
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:12,170
You stay. Gnolls don't move. Let's shoot down. Let's shoot at you. See, they can't make it.

500
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:43,020
Now I'll have... Wait, why could you do that? These things suck. Just kill them. Why won't

501
01:25:43,020 --> 01:26:08,439
they do anything? Why are the dwarves freezing in panic? I just hasted them. They have low

502
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:14,199
morale. Well, I did pretty good. And then we get all this stuff. And I might have to wait

503
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:20,119
till another turn. Yes. Look at all this. Artifact. Boots of speed. Gold. Oak trees.

504
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:27,720
What are... Oh, no. That's just oak trees. Okay. Never mind. I thought it was wood. Okay.

505
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:37,609
Things looking up. 15. Look at all this money. I think I'm gonna be really greedy.

506
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:44,250
I don't think I'm just gonna take like 20 grand. No, play long, long game. Long game.

507
01:26:44,250 --> 01:27:06,630
Long game. Basic scouting or advanced earth magic. Yeah. I said that in like a YouTube

508
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:13,350
voice, but I know I did, but I don't care. I'm excited about that. One on the finger.

509
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:17,189
This item increases your luck and morale by plus one. Maybe the dwarves will actually

510
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:35,640
fucking move now. Six mercury. Six gems. 700 gold. And boots of speed. One on feet.

511
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:44,619
These boots increase a hero's movement rate over land. That's amazing. Finally. Did I

512
01:27:44,619 --> 01:27:51,989
miss anything? I got everything, right? I think that's good. I think I've cleaned it up.

513
01:27:57,819 --> 01:28:03,020
All right. Nobody in the area. I can come back and claim some stuff. And then...

514
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:09,079
Yeah, this is looking good. This is looking good. How much money do I got? Stack it up.

515
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:20,859
I need 10,000 for the capital. What are we? Day five? Let me get the wyvern nest.

516
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:37,899
Take over the other cities. Yeah. I mean, I'll be able to. What do you got? Few, few,

517
01:28:37,899 --> 01:28:42,539
few. Dude, I think I'm gonna... Here's my plan. I've already... I did like the magical,

518
01:28:42,539 --> 01:28:49,020
like hidden secret area. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna go back to the house.

519
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:56,439
I'm gonna stack and have like a hundred of all these. And then this person's gonna be the

520
01:28:56,439 --> 01:29:10,949
conqueror. And I did just get those boots, so let's see how well they work. That's pretty

521
01:29:10,949 --> 01:29:17,350
good. I mean, that's pretty good. I'm going a lot further, I think. Is that just placebo

522
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:28,260
effect or what? I forgot the oak. Oh, whatever. Okay, whatever. I need to turn

523
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:32,739
this into a capital. Let's do... I could do... No, I could upgrade the wyvern nest for the

524
01:29:32,739 --> 01:29:52,260
next week. Yes. Wyvern monarchs. 70, 18, 22. That is much better. I'll have plenty of time to do

525
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:56,409
other stuff because it's gonna take another couple days for me to get back here so I can

526
01:29:56,409 --> 01:30:16,760
do like the mage guild. Lots of griffins. Get the fuck out of my way. All right, let's go

527
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:29,210
back. I can do mage guild level two. It's a bunch of resources. I can learn new spells.

528
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:41,029
And let's recruit. All right, now I'm going to save money. By the time I get back there,

529
01:30:41,029 --> 01:30:48,569
I want to have to be a capital. Purple's dead. Purple's heroes have abandoned him.

530
01:30:48,569 --> 01:30:54,899
He is banished from the land. There are now six that remain. Bye purple. It was really nice

531
01:30:54,899 --> 01:31:08,680
knowing you. Oh boy, that's a lot. 50. That's 50 griffins. Oh fuck. All right,

532
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:22,659
send in the dwarves. Send in the dwarves. Hide everybody except the dwarves. All right,

533
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:31,800
where do you want me? Walk straight ahead into the 50 griffins. Do you think that's wise? No,

534
01:31:33,609 --> 01:31:55,979
not at all. Oh, what's this? Nice! And bloodlust and haste. Everybody else chill.

535
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:15,380
We're all just watching. Is he going to do it? Move it. I'm coming through. Death comes for you.

536
01:32:18,489 --> 01:32:36,920
Everybody stay. Just support the dwarves. Bloodlust. He's got extra luck. They're dead.

537
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:50,310
It's okay. It's all right. They got rid of seven. Not very lucky. Six dwarves die. Oh,

538
01:32:50,789 --> 01:33:01,579
hmm. I gotta send the magma guys in. A new hero approaches. What? Why do I have to do this?

539
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:18,119
Because you don't come from our castle. What? What does that mean? It means I can't make any

540
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:24,140
of you, so I have to fill my stacks with people that I have in my castle. But do you

541
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:29,420
see how strong I've been for you? Have you even seen what I've done for you?

542
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:52,500
Well, prove it. Show me. You're an idiot. You let him go by. You let him go by. You shouldn't

543
01:33:52,500 --> 01:34:04,020
have let him do that. You've killed everybody. Come on. Show why. Now everyone's going to fight

544
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:21,399
now. Nope. Run away. Send the dolls in. Block the path. Lucky shot. Good.

545
01:34:30,329 --> 01:35:12,420
What do I do? I'm not doing that. Purple's dead. I'm going a long way. I'm not losing

546
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:21,510
all my... I'm not losing all my basilisks to 50 griffins. Wait, purple died this time. No,

547
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:27,159
you're not purple. Yeah, purple died. Plus I can reclaim this stuff. Yeah, no, I'm going a long

548
01:35:27,159 --> 01:35:45,270
way. Wait! Harpies. So much for not save scumming. Yeah, but sometimes you have to.

549
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:52,890
I'm playing a win. I'm playing a win. See, we still have one dwarf. Six thousand. I can

550
01:35:52,890 --> 01:36:05,140
do the citadel capital coming up real soon. Don't buy anything. I've got a mercury

551
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:17,899
factory that I'm going to reclaim. Cliff nest. Get the rocks. No, what? What are you talking

552
01:36:17,899 --> 01:36:35,449
about? I already cleared it out. Did they already like me? 10,000 not yet. Tan came in here.

553
01:36:40,569 --> 01:36:46,119
Well, whatever. I don't really want... I don't really want the rocks. I'll give you a very

554
01:36:46,119 --> 01:36:51,560
specific reason why. They're good, but they're kind of just gonna take up space

555
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:58,600
and the dwarves and the rocks, they're good, but they're gonna just take up space and I need

556
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:11,239
more of my own units. Did I already go here? Holy shit. Yep. Okay. Everything's good. Now

557
01:37:11,239 --> 01:37:21,100
we're just gonna make our way back down home. 10,000. I can now do the citadel and things

558
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:29,590
are looking good. Capital building 4,000 fucking gold every single day until our last day.

559
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:41,560
I can put them in the garrison. That's not a bad idea. We're gonna, this is what we're gonna do.

560
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:52,739
Yeah, we're gonna dump. Let's touch the rally flag first. What's over here? That's a lot

561
01:37:52,739 --> 01:38:04,460
of griffins to be guarding something over here for no reason. What is this? Odd. All right,

562
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:13,060
let's get the rocks, the dwarves, and the magma men in the garrison or keep the magma men.

563
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:38,020
That's good. Let us recruit. I got 6,000 gold. More hiring. What you gonna do?

564
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:44,119
Wait two. That's because I'm trying to get these like out of the monarchs, right?

565
01:38:44,119 --> 01:38:56,520
Okay, we'll do it next week. Get you guys upgraded to the better ones. I want to see

566
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:05,670
where is that nest. 70 health. 70 health. This is 14, 14, 14 to 18, 14, 14, 18 to 22,

567
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:22,439
and faster. Nice. Okay. You head out of here with one dwarf, please. You're gonna transfer

568
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:26,520
this dwarf. You're gonna go sit in the garrison. I'm gonna get another hero.

569
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:40,970
You thought this place is called mud shit? No. It's not called mud shit. All right.

570
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:56,060
We're back. Now we're gonna restock. Pretty damn good. All right. I need more gnolls. I got

571
01:39:56,060 --> 01:40:14,979
lots of money. I'm gonna send you up to the garrison. Are these bulls? These bulls are

572
01:40:14,979 --> 01:40:26,100
upgraded. Mighty Gorgons, yeah. They're not upgraded? I thought they were. No, I didn't.

573
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:34,710
Hydropond is the next thing coming up. Or mage guild level up. I think mage guild.

574
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:47,140
Yeah, they're leveled up already. You hang out in here for a minute. You get in the

575
01:40:47,140 --> 01:41:09,609
garrison. Can I not put you up here? I guess he can't go in the garrison. Okay. Well,

576
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:22,140
I kind of need to send him out to do stuff. He's gonna go explore up here while I get this

577
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:27,779
hero ready to go. We went down last time. I'm gonna go up. I'm gonna go this way.

578
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:43,399
He's just a scout at this point. One dwarf scout army. That's probably a really stupid

579
01:41:43,399 --> 01:41:49,180
idea, but you know, I'm going for it. What's the worst that's gonna happen? He's

580
01:41:49,180 --> 01:42:05,960
gonna die. He's a level two. Okay, we need some more. Got more bulls. I just need more cash. I

581
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:12,069
need more money. I gotta get in that guy. I gotta conquer. You're coming down here. What's

582
01:42:12,069 --> 01:42:20,869
this look like here? Several pack and then lots. Several. What is that? This is Jabarcas.

583
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:37,689
Yeah, go explore. Go explore. Get us some resources. Get us some money. I can get 27 of

584
01:42:37,689 --> 01:42:45,050
these. More of these. Good. 73 lizard warriors. I might even split these up.

585
01:42:45,689 --> 01:42:52,409
I think here's what's... hear me out on this. Get to a hundred lizard warriors

586
01:42:53,289 --> 01:42:59,449
and get a new hero that is just a, you know, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15. Just have all

587
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:21,560
archers. Like 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15. And then send them out. Why? To lay the

588
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:39,859
smack down. I don't know. You suck at this. I'm doing pretty well right now. I couldn't...

589
01:43:39,859 --> 01:43:47,340
people came to... okay, he made it over there. He had to have lost shit for that, right? He

590
01:43:47,340 --> 01:44:04,220
took out three staxi griffins. He's probably weak. Nah, stick with the scout. What is this?

591
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:15,270
Warren? Something down here maybe? I got 5,000. That's a new weak. I just... I can get more

592
01:44:15,909 --> 01:44:25,000
fucking gorgons. God damn it. I have so many of these. All right. I think it's time to,

593
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,739
I think it's time to take, take her out again. Although the next thing I'm going to do a bunch

594
01:44:29,739 --> 01:44:48,579
of gnolls. Or should I just stack her to be unbeatable? She will be un... okay, let me

595
01:44:48,579 --> 01:45:03,930
see what you lost by doing that. Guys, guys, those griffins joined him. If I had just

596
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:24,630
walked over there, I would have probably had like a hundred griffins. Damn it. That sucks.

597
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:43,689
That really sucks. Would you like to... sure. 14. All right. Ogre fort. What was anything down

598
01:45:43,689 --> 01:45:46,250
here? I wonder if it... is it worth checking to see if there's something like on the edge here?

599
01:45:47,210 --> 01:46:08,729
Just gonna check. Nothing. I could still kill him. Should I just go after him right now with

600
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:23,779
this army? One more day. One more day. Recruit everybody. I don't have enough money. Let him

601
01:46:23,779 --> 01:46:38,680
at least go through the garrison first. Yeah, that's true. There he goes. 31. They're not that good.

602
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:46,279
Okay, 31. Holy, he's got... what the fuck? He's got six cyclops. This is actually a good indicator

603
01:46:46,279 --> 01:46:56,329
to see what he's got. He's got six cyclops. Oh man. He's got five behemoths. This is what

604
01:46:56,329 --> 01:47:07,899
throws us over the edge. Bad. Very badly. If only I had like tried to pursue that,

605
01:47:07,899 --> 01:47:12,539
I would have had these griffins. And that changes everything.

606
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:23,000
Uh, I mean, I'm just gonna fly around and just have him come to us. Maybe I could take out

607
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:32,170
somebody? No. It's impossible. I'm not gonna be able to kill one person.

608
01:47:33,689 --> 01:47:48,279
Yeah, this game will... I can't even attack. I killed six of their riders.

609
01:47:48,279 --> 01:47:55,930
And now he didn't even want to come down. He's coming down. Well, it's gonna be a fight.

610
01:47:57,699 --> 01:48:25,220
It's gonna be a fight. Give me some more archers. 87 archers. He might not come all the way down.

611
01:48:25,859 --> 01:48:40,359
This ogre hut right here. Let me just go up this way. Claim that. I have that claimed,

612
01:48:40,359 --> 01:48:46,069
that claimed. Blue is up here. I don't think I can do anything with this.

613
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:56,140
All right, let's see what happens here. No. He just took... all right, he turned.

614
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:17,960
Open field? I don't know if that's a good idea. More archers. A hundred. They have a hundred

615
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:34,260
fucking archers. Let's see. Let me take a look at the garrison. He left his riders in the

616
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:43,930
garrison. But he's got such power units. He's got such heavy units. He's gonna have to come

617
01:49:43,930 --> 01:49:49,989
to me. I'm not gonna risk it. Can I claim this and take ogres? I can. I'll do that next

618
01:49:49,989 --> 01:50:19,460
turn. It's like this guy can have at least something. This is like the battle. Here it

619
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:31,750
comes. Here we go. Here we go. Minimal casualties. But did she not learn the spells?

620
01:50:32,229 --> 01:50:37,779
Didn't upgrade it to level two or three? I'm just going with... who's the most dangerous

621
01:50:37,779 --> 01:50:49,960
here? Somebody can fly over. I'm thinking of... this is range. The cyclops has to go.

622
01:50:53,819 --> 01:51:07,449
These two... that'll be a fight. Five cyclops. Gotta go for it. Four. All right, grab the bat.

623
01:51:07,449 --> 01:51:15,159
Don't move. There's no reason to go out there. Just have to defend. Are you ranged? I mean,

624
01:51:16,939 --> 01:51:28,439
do I just dive out? Okay. These are pretty beefy. 70 health, 1822. I mean, I could

625
01:51:28,439 --> 01:51:39,859
probably kill a... stay just to defend. All right. The ball... what are the... what's the

626
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:50,760
ball stats? Pretty beefy. I could... to stay... hold the line. Oh! You can do that?

627
01:51:52,220 --> 01:52:09,399
Since when can you do that? That was... fuck yeah. I got to do it twice. I got the once

628
01:52:09,399 --> 01:52:21,989
again. All right. Now who do I buff with this? I'm buff... should I buff the archers? I think you

629
01:52:21,989 --> 01:52:34,199
have to. They're the only ones that can do anything. It's defense. I don't want anyone

630
01:52:34,199 --> 01:52:39,210
to die. They're the only ones that can do anything. All right. Now we've got the healing

631
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:47,420
tent. Who got the axe thrown in their face? You did. They're getting in line here. They're

632
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:59,579
not... I might not lose like very many at all. Magic arrow and we'll go for... they're just in a

633
01:52:59,579 --> 01:53:37,560
line. This is like a diner dash. We're going for the front of the line. Catapult. Oh my god.

634
01:53:49,829 --> 01:54:16,409
Buff, buff, buff. They're trying to get in. Oh, crash. Nobody move. Don't ever... nobody

635
01:54:16,409 --> 01:54:29,659
fucking move. Oh, he's in. It's okay. He's in. He's poisoned. Get in there. Get up there. Smash

636
01:54:29,659 --> 01:54:49,189
him. Right in front of you. And extra lucky. Oh my god, dude. I can't... I didn't lose anybody.

637
01:54:49,189 --> 01:54:59,859
I'm gonna get so much experience. I lost like five people. Don't anybody move. It's too

638
01:54:59,859 --> 01:55:22,979
dangerous. Get the fuck out of here. He lost everything. He lost all his shit. Everybody.

639
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:30,039
Blue is now in a lot of trouble. That was like their biggest units. Advanced sorcerer.

640
01:55:33,479 --> 01:55:51,020
Basic intelligence. Maximum spell points or expert earth magic. Gone. Now we do this thing called

641
01:55:52,279 --> 01:56:06,760
I want my mage tower to be higher. Mage build level two. Weakness. Disrupting ray. Ice bolt.

642
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:21,739
Quicksand. All right, good. We're gonna do it again tomorrow. Let's go get our shit. What did he

643
01:56:21,739 --> 01:56:35,109
take? He only took the ore, huh? Nothing else claimed by him except up here. The 100 archers

644
01:56:35,109 --> 01:56:41,829
is very strong. Yeah, it's very good. Uh, I mean, this garrison is just dumb. I don't really

645
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:48,140
care. I'll just get it back later. Continue the exploration. Actually, no, I'm one of the

646
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:53,939
ogres, right? Well, let's just, is there something I can claim like up here? We can go up this way.

647
01:56:53,939 --> 01:57:08,500
Mage tower. Magic plains. Yeah, I'm just gonna wait. Here comes Tan. Oh, fine. You don't. Wait.

648
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:22,340
Burger Prince is dead. Is Burger Prince out? Burger Prince doesn't have anything.

649
01:57:22,899 --> 01:57:30,359
I think we just retreat here. There's no reason to have anybody do this. One dwarf and 14

650
01:57:31,239 --> 01:57:41,079
trolls. That's it. See you later. The cowardly jerel flees from battle.

651
01:57:41,880 --> 01:58:01,079
It doesn't matter. Mage tower. Level three. Let's take a look. Earthquake randomly damages

652
01:58:01,079 --> 01:58:06,520
two sections of castle wall in combat. Half the selected enemy unit forgets to use its

653
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:12,460
ranged attack and fireball burst into flames fire damage to the target and adjacent units.

654
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:31,829
All right. It is time to take you out. I now have a very, very good formidable offense.

655
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:40,409
Well, maybe I should do one more day. Yeah, well, next week. One week. Two more days.

656
01:58:41,529 --> 01:58:50,300
Two more days. That's it. Just two more days. All right. Did that. Two more days.

657
01:58:50,939 --> 01:59:02,180
God damn it, man. And that will get me another tower in the, in the, no, I got

658
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:11,909
a level three cage of warlords defense and strength plus two to a garrison. No, just save

659
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:23,579
hydra pond. I could get hydras. Oh, that can be on another hero though. I got to get out.

660
01:59:23,579 --> 01:59:35,350
I got to get moving. I've got to get out here. What did tan hold on to tan just like,

661
01:59:35,989 --> 01:59:48,619
I can kill them right now. It's time to go. I can do it right now. Give me more height.

662
01:59:48,619 --> 01:59:54,340
Give me more of these. I got to get somebody out there. Look at this. This army is fucking

663
01:59:54,340 --> 02:00:10,859
insane. 35, like 20, 30 bulls, 116 archers. Like, I just, I got to get, I got to start

664
02:00:10,859 --> 02:00:22,140
conquering. This is good because then another hero can start stacking. I got all the spells

665
02:00:22,140 --> 02:01:01,210
learned, right? Do I have the spells learned? No, I do. Okay. Come on. Sell, sell the ore.

666
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:21,319
But I, it's, I need it. It's only 25. How much are dragonflies for one? Oh god, he like two

667
02:01:21,319 --> 02:01:58,329
grand. Oh, that's so many. Come on. What else can I do? A little bit. No, no, that's it. That's

668
02:01:58,329 --> 02:02:12,380
it. That's it. That's it. That's it. 125 nulls, 126 nulls. Let's go. A new hero can come in

669
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:18,520
tomorrow. I am stacked. No one will fucking defeat me at this stage. Not even close.

670
02:02:19,319 --> 02:02:26,539
There's just hobgoblins hanging out over here now. Oh, it's because it's the month of the hobgoblin.

671
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:40,890
Oh, well that makes sense. Nobody in this garrison go. Why would you go? Well, lots of hobgoblins.

672
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:47,659
Get out of the fucking way. Why do I have to go all the way around? I can't just,

673
02:02:51,859 --> 02:03:19,859
hey, thanks for killing it. He's dead. Goodbye. Oh, you are pathetic. Look at your

674
02:03:19,859 --> 02:03:25,060
pathetic army next to my large army with all the dragons and the magma and the

675
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:35,989
earthquake. Oh, do you have fucking fireball? Oh, what's that? Oh, sorry. Am I gonna fireball

676
02:03:35,989 --> 02:03:49,909
the fuck out of you? I'm thinking fireball the centaurs. Whoa, what's this? What's like the

677
02:03:49,909 --> 02:03:56,470
cousin it? Psychic elemental attacks all adjacent enemies without retaliation. Mind spell immunity.

678
02:03:56,470 --> 02:04:05,529
Okay, kill this immediately. Fireball down here. That's not a mind spell. Fireball.

679
02:04:05,529 --> 02:04:14,539
Hit the griffon and hit everything down here. Bingo. You got nothing. You have nothing.

680
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:24,579
And in fact, I could probably fly over with my bugs and just start killing. But maybe I won't.

681
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:57,460
Get out of here. You realize what's happening. He must have had something really, really good.

682
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:04,039
Because why would you? I mean, he retreated. He deleted all those minions.

683
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:11,180
All right, we're gonna go up, up here. Let's hit the rally point.

684
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:48,569
He is. Oh, it's no, it's Gibrakas. Wait, new hero time.

685
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:04,149
Merlinda the witch or Luna the old enemy. I think it's gonna be

686
02:06:05,109 --> 02:06:24,710
elementalist or witch. The witch. Let's get you some minions. Pretty cool.

687
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:36,920
Pretty good. Witch. What's your specialty? Is weakness. Better effect. In just a moment,

688
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:40,840
after another week, you're going to be heading out yourself with a stacked group of

689
02:06:42,779 --> 02:06:56,279
minions. It's a stacked group of minions. Just nothing over here. Somebody already took it.

690
02:06:57,079 --> 02:07:03,000
All right. Super north or right? I think I want to do. What's the sanctuary?

691
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:23,560
I want to go that way. Super north? No, look at this. A thousand experience. Sanctuary. Great

692
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:31,670
weight has been lifted. You feel safe. I don't think I can be attacked here. I don't think

693
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:42,119
I can be attacked. I'm going up this way. What do you got over here? This is a little

694
02:07:42,119 --> 02:07:56,340
standoff. Hole. Should I check the hole? No, I'm in the hole. Why do the fucking hole

695
02:07:56,340 --> 02:08:10,279
just make me do that? I didn't even want to do that. Hole. Hydro punt. How much are the

696
02:08:10,279 --> 02:08:25,960
upgraded hydras? I can do it tomorrow. I don't like that route you're taking. It's really

697
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:34,760
pissing me off. I'm going to go beige tower. No, up here. I want this experience. A thousand

698
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:51,270
experience. Thousand exp. There is a sawmill right here. Grab this. Almost there. Fifteen

699
02:08:51,270 --> 02:09:14,649
thousand. Taking all my shit. Something that way. Yep, sulfur. Fourteen thousand. I'm almost

700
02:09:14,649 --> 02:09:30,380
there. I now have ultra hydras. He's coming after you? I don't think he is. I mean,

701
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:41,350
I'm about to meet him. I'm about to go down that way. Yeah, this is his like shitty guy.

702
02:09:41,909 --> 02:09:48,949
He's got like a few, few, few and a bunch of dumb skeletons. This is his main. Might be

703
02:09:48,949 --> 02:09:58,470
time for an open field battle. And then head up this way. Or head down here and check out

704
02:09:58,470 --> 02:10:19,829
the other quadrant. Yeah. Where are you off to? Did you just recruit those or did you kill them?

705
02:10:19,829 --> 02:10:39,399
I swear to god if you recruited them. Nope. You had to fight them. Hello. Upgraded hydra

706
02:10:39,399 --> 02:10:49,430
pond. Chaos hydras. Regular hydras. 135 health. 250 health. Attacks all adjacent enemies

707
02:10:49,430 --> 02:11:12,220
and cannot. Enemies cannot retaliate. 21 defense. In a few days you'll be able to take

708
02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:20,340
your venture of your own. Your move. Oh, don't get away from him. He's so strong.

709
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:38,409
Fuck out of here. Let me back my stuff. Well, he's dead now. I got you locked in here.

710
02:11:39,399 --> 02:11:49,720
You got a boat? I don't see a boat. Did you get them? Did you take those worthless things?

711
02:11:50,520 --> 02:12:09,479
Oh, you did, didn't you? Here comes Tan. Uh oh, there's a battle going on over here.

712
02:12:09,479 --> 02:12:34,359
Okay. Uh, no. That's mine. Here we go. Here comes the big one. Fireball weakness maybe. Or just

713
02:12:34,359 --> 02:12:40,569
fireball. Right in the middle here. Fireball right here. This will get all three of them.

714
02:12:43,029 --> 02:12:49,109
More fireball down here. Do I want to hit more units or do I want to get rid of

715
02:12:49,989 --> 02:12:56,060
the water minions? I think I'm thinking right in the middle here. This is perfect.

716
02:12:56,060 --> 02:13:04,439
I get the tent too. Let's go for it. Yeah. I hope that was worth you like $3,000.

717
02:13:05,399 --> 02:13:20,630
Okay. The big bad guy here is the behemoth. Oh, 300 fucking health. Focus. Oh, this is not good.

718
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:32,659
I gotta focus behemoth. Actually, like fucking, it's 1200 HP. Uh, I don't know if I want to,

719
02:13:32,659 --> 02:13:37,060
do I just, I think it's time to, we just gotta go in. How many are here? 250 hobgoblins.

720
02:13:43,159 --> 02:13:53,420
Who's ranged here? I don't think they have ranged. Unless these guys throw axes or

721
02:13:53,420 --> 02:13:58,140
something, right? Don't these guys throw? No. No, they don't have any range. Well, they,

722
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:10,220
no, they don't. No fucking ranged at all. I just got fucking, all right. I gotta,

723
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:18,489
you have, I gotta fight back here. Oh, you can move across the whole fucking map.

724
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:44,840
I'm gonna have to petrifying attack. You gotta go to, I just have to try to help

725
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:53,350
and get rid of you. Nice. Come on. Let me go with the Gorgon. All right. Should we send

726
02:14:53,350 --> 02:15:02,380
him to slime? Okay. I'm going to buff Gorgon. Buff Gorgon. Gorgon. Go after the behemoth.

727
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:09,619
Sacrifice the magmas. No, no, no, no, no. We're going to slime. Slime the Gorgons.

728
02:15:09,619 --> 02:15:33,819
Here we go. Death stare. Protection. Go for it. Here we go. Fuck just happened.

729
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:43,510
I just killed two. I just killed two behemoths in one hit. Are you kidding me?

730
02:15:44,229 --> 02:15:51,180
I get to go again. Oh, nice. God damn it. I could have been able to attack you.

731
02:15:52,300 --> 02:16:10,439
Oh, you're still alive. He's still alive. No. All right. Snake is going to go take out the

732
02:16:10,439 --> 02:16:20,819
minions in the back here. Right here. Wait. Fireball. These guys. I might be able to get

733
02:16:20,819 --> 02:16:32,250
rid of most of them. Or Fireball right here. I think I'm going to Fireball right in the

734
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:50,170
middle and then do bloodlust. I could, that was pretty, that was good. That's pretty good.

735
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:57,159
All right. Now clean them up. Snake. Into the back. Snipe. There's like three there.

736
02:16:57,159 --> 02:17:10,170
Snipe in the back. Ow. Okay. Dragon. Go for behemoth. I think we still have to

737
02:17:10,170 --> 02:17:28,500
surround the behemoth. What does he have? Two? He might have like, okay. All right.

738
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:31,299
Only one more. Where are you going? You're going to the archers. No, you're not.

739
02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:41,370
Why would you go for the gnolls? Behemoth is dead. 252 of these guys coming in.

740
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:55,290
Oh wow. Magma. Get in there. 214. I just killed like 60. Bulls. Up here. Up here. Up here. Up

741
02:17:55,290 --> 02:18:08,950
here. Kill the Hydra. The dragon. Yes. I still can't, I can't cast any spells. All right.

742
02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:24,709
Bring them up. Bring up the gnolls. I win. There are some casualties, but I mean like,

743
02:18:26,229 --> 02:18:37,129
I did it. Basic logistics. Movement over land. Yes. Advanced logistics. 20% more movement over

744
02:18:37,129 --> 02:18:48,600
land. Uh, that's awesome. Let me get this back. It's already there. Okay. Looking good.

745
02:18:49,239 --> 02:18:57,959
Now what about you? You have several big scary birds. I'm going to keep moving with this

746
02:18:57,959 --> 02:19:05,219
group. I want to come back up here. Claim. I'll claim my stuff back. Nothing else.

747
02:19:05,219 --> 02:19:22,629
Is this just disappear? Back to the citadel. Let's get another team going. Now you're coming

748
02:19:22,629 --> 02:19:25,909
down here. Why? Okay. Why? Why do I always have to deal with the fucking asshole that

749
02:19:25,909 --> 02:19:31,180
has like the shitload of enemies? I keep like preventing you from coming down. All right.

750
02:19:32,059 --> 02:19:58,459
I need to head back out again. You guys just taking up space. Okay. There we go. 48 of these

751
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:09,579
in a room because of, let's take it. I have to go restock. I got these chaos hydras though.

752
02:20:09,579 --> 02:20:26,020
So these things are fucking insane. Oh, there's two gnolls. All right. Restock. I'll be able to

753
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:31,860
have probably five. I'll have at least five chaos hydras, which now I become the behemoth.

754
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:38,040
Right? No. Do I want to get up here and claim? Did you take anything else over here?

755
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:47,860
He took this. I want this back. What is it? Sulfur. Is it worth me taking a detour? No.

756
02:20:47,860 --> 02:21:04,520
Just get back. Just get back into town. Not worth taking a detour for. All right. Now.

757
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:21,350
Here we go. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Magma. Magma has to be traded. For chaos? I mean,

758
02:21:21,350 --> 02:21:35,030
five chaos hydras. Magma or? I mean, this is a destructive team. You can keep the gnolls.

759
02:21:35,590 --> 02:21:52,020
Gnolls for magma. Yeah. The magma can't be replenished. That's true. I could wait another

760
02:21:52,020 --> 02:22:04,389
day. Yeah. I'm going to leave magma, but I'm going to wait one more day because I want,

761
02:22:05,370 --> 02:22:28,540
uh, I want, I want to take more. I want more. One more week. Give me more.

762
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:57,379
Okay. Hey Red. You're fucking dead. Okay. Okay. I want some archer. No, just go. I'm ready.

763
02:22:58,979 --> 02:23:11,989
Save it. Red has, uh, what? Okay. What denomination turns into a throng? Is it a

764
02:23:11,989 --> 02:23:23,260
hundred or is it more than a hundred? It's a hundred plus. Okay. So I have a throng of,

765
02:23:24,739 --> 02:23:37,940
and then what? Lots is between what? 50 and a hundred. I mean, this would be,

766
02:23:37,940 --> 02:23:52,149
this is very equal. It's very even. And a horde is what? More than 500? A horde is 50 to me.

767
02:23:52,149 --> 02:23:57,270
All right. I'm going up. It's time. I'm not coming back again. I've got my army. This is

768
02:23:57,270 --> 02:24:02,600
the army that I'm going to use. I'm going straight up. No, no, no. I can't go straight

769
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:08,840
up. I can say, yeah, I can. So whatever's left, I need to start taking cities and

770
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:19,799
buildings and stuff. Red's going to make their way to the right. I'm going to go north. I'm

771
02:24:19,799 --> 02:24:28,709
going right up that road and I'm going to have a second army. Yeah, I'll have a second army.

772
02:24:29,350 --> 02:24:33,719
Let's go investigate what's up here. Is it a road? It does lead to here. I'll take this

773
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:41,110
and there's a little lake here. I'm not going to forget about my second hero.

774
02:24:50,309 --> 02:25:03,690
Keep going. Nobody in your garrison. It's mine now. All right. We're crossing into

775
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:14,180
uncharted territory. Another, you have two garrisons. Ooh, this is like undead world.

776
02:25:14,899 --> 02:25:29,420
I can't even go up there. All right. Starting to build a little bit of a force here. I get

777
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:34,389
the magma guy here. What about building? Blood obelisk. I'm going to do some of these.

778
02:25:38,420 --> 02:25:41,780
Plus two to a garrison hero's attack when defending against a siege. I'm going to get it.

779
02:25:42,899 --> 02:25:54,809
I'm going for Red's castle. I think Red is up here, right? Red or Tan?

780
02:25:55,530 --> 02:26:09,540
Blue's dead. Blue is no more. There are five remaining. Tons of resources up here that I

781
02:26:09,540 --> 02:26:17,940
can just take. Should I go up here? I feel like this is... I need to see what it is.

782
02:26:18,659 --> 02:26:28,840
Anything else? Cage of warlords increases the defense of the hero. Should just get

783
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:35,180
to plus one defense and I think I am maxed the fuck out besides the shipyard. This is my

784
02:26:35,180 --> 02:27:05,079
ultra capital. Here he comes. Teal is dead. Uh-oh! No! Is there a castle up here? I hope

785
02:27:05,079 --> 02:27:20,549
you got it. It's not a castle! I thought that was a castle. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

786
02:27:20,549 --> 02:27:27,620
He might not come all the way down here. He might not come down here. Nope. He didn't come

787
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:44,940
down. We're good. Something's right fucking here. All right. We just made... Okay. Give

788
02:27:44,940 --> 02:27:52,819
me those chaos hydras. Give me some of these wyverns. Bulls. Okay. We're... Everything's

789
02:27:52,819 --> 02:28:48,979
going to be all right. He's got fucking phoenixes. Well, I kind of just lose. There's

790
02:28:48,979 --> 02:29:05,219
not much I can do. I might have to reload. There's not much that could be done. I think

791
02:29:05,219 --> 02:29:19,850
if I lose this castle, I lose because I was wasting time. Well, I thought there could

792
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:26,739
have been a town up there. It don't matter. I'm just going to go straight this time

793
02:29:27,620 --> 02:29:41,370
and I'll be able to take the castle straight from the road. Yeah, but I mean,

794
02:29:41,370 --> 02:29:48,489
this is like tons of little paths you can go around. All right. I think I lose. No, not

795
02:29:48,489 --> 02:29:52,409
quite. Green's dead. You only have seven days to capture a town or you'll be banished

796
02:29:52,409 --> 02:30:08,100
from the land. I mean, I would have done things differently. I would have done it a little

797
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:21,879
differently. Let's just see what's up here. This is orange. Do you have a castle right here?

798
02:30:28,870 --> 02:30:39,610
How far up is your castle? It's like all the way up there, huh?

799
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:45,860
Take it? I mean, I don't know if I'm going to be able to take it. I might

800
02:30:45,860 --> 02:30:57,799
have to reload. New home. I don't know if it's going to be new home. It might be. Let's

801
02:30:57,799 --> 02:31:26,889
find a new home. Let's see if it's a new home. Hey, can I have your house? Oh, I have earthquake.

802
02:31:26,889 --> 02:31:31,450
Oh my God. I'm just so distracted by how annoyed I am at losing my fucking capital.

803
02:31:32,649 --> 02:31:41,909
Well, we can just get in. How should I go after here? I'm using a fireball and a siege.

804
02:31:45,700 --> 02:31:55,239
I know I'll probably win this, but at what cost? 250 health. Two to five damage. It's

805
02:31:55,239 --> 02:31:57,479
not going to be enough. I don't think I'm going to be able to kill it. I'm going to

806
02:31:57,479 --> 02:32:14,200
try and kill the bulls or the basilisks. I don't feel the kill though. I'm just going to go for

807
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:20,309
like the fucking basilisks that have the least amount of health. We'll just go right here and

808
02:32:20,309 --> 02:32:30,899
see what happens. Kill in one hit? Yes. I get to go again. Perfect. Let me get minimal losses

809
02:32:30,899 --> 02:32:41,239
here and it won't be a complete waste. Why in with the dragon? Yeah, just kill that.

810
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:57,059
Why would you attack this? Basilisks can't get in. You can move over. Can you knock it in either?

811
02:32:57,059 --> 02:33:08,760
Hydra can't get in. Nobody else can get in actually. It's the same faction. Yeah,

812
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:24,489
we might just be trading castles. Not dead. You're still alive. That seems fucking ridiculous.

813
02:33:24,489 --> 02:33:40,680
There's only one of you. Kill it. Holy shit. How do you still have one? I've done like

814
02:33:41,239 --> 02:34:03,659
four or five hundred damage. What the fuck? I can do this.

815
02:34:05,899 --> 02:34:17,930
Didn't do anything. I still can't get in there. I didn't do anything. It just like

816
02:34:17,930 --> 02:34:28,889
shook the ground for a second. Who's in? There's still you, the bulls. What do you

817
02:34:28,889 --> 02:34:35,690
got? Eleven. Let's go for the bulls. I'm not even fucking hurting these things.

818
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:49,370
Ninety-five archers can't even kill one bull. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

819
02:34:49,450 --> 02:35:33,000
That's 39 of these things. Hooray. Hello. Kill. Kill. I'll go in next. I'll just hang out here.

820
02:35:33,479 --> 02:35:54,360
I'm gonna be healing somebody. Can you move, please? What should I do? Fucking magic arrow.

821
02:35:54,360 --> 02:36:01,540
Ice bolt. Let's just ice bolt this motherfucker. Let's kill him. There's just the

822
02:36:01,540 --> 02:36:08,819
nulls and I have a new town. I kind of died but I lost a lot but I'll get a ton of experience.

823
02:36:09,459 --> 02:36:18,360
Forty-four hundred. It's the same town. It's the same one. Let's just hope that they build

824
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:29,719
up their town as much as I built up mine. Expert sorcery. Fifty percent more damage.

825
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:40,219
What does it look like? All right, well you don't have a capital but I can get that

826
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:46,120
very soon. What about the dickhead that's right here? He's gonna kill him right now.

827
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:52,520
Wipe out. I'm gonna kill green. I'm literally gonna wipe out orange. I have enough to get rid of him,

828
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:58,629
I think. He only he has like a pack of lots. Pack pack. He doesn't have like he's several.

829
02:36:59,979 --> 02:37:06,860
Not green. I'm talking about orange. Yeah, I think I can take him. Let him attack but I

830
02:37:06,860 --> 02:37:13,750
don't think he won't. He'll run away. He's gonna run away. I want to eliminate orange.

831
02:37:13,750 --> 02:37:35,670
Here we go because I've got five. He has five. I have 12. He has 10. Yeah, I'm gonna win

832
02:37:35,670 --> 02:37:45,000
this. I got 39 fucking bulls. He's dead. 160. Yeah, these guys are terrible. This is like

833
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:50,819
having gnolls. They're not that good. All right, priority target is the titans.

834
02:37:51,540 --> 02:38:04,899
Could just throw a fireball over here and we'll throw a fireball here or I could do

835
02:38:05,459 --> 02:38:11,989
bloodlust on the hydras or I could yeah I could do an ice bolt on the titans.

836
02:38:13,530 --> 02:38:20,040
Actually, I like that idea. I like the ice bolt on the titans or weakness or

837
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:24,680
yeah let me do that. Randomly places eight small patches of quicksand on the battlefield

838
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:27,559
which are only visible to the caster and creatures native to the terrain.

839
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:32,040
Walking into quicksand ends a unit's movement for the turn and makes it visible.

840
02:38:35,479 --> 02:38:46,700
I'll bolt them. Took away one. None of them have a lot of movement besides the

841
02:38:46,700 --> 02:38:49,659
genie and the genie flying over here would be like a terrible mistake.

842
02:38:50,780 --> 02:38:58,409
So I'm gonna bring you up here. I think I'm just gonna wait or maybe I'll bring you up

843
02:38:58,409 --> 02:39:09,909
here above and then fly in. Yeah, that's the plan. I'll take you guys out by jumping in.

844
02:39:09,909 --> 02:39:17,579
Because the range is up here. I get to go again. Unbelievable. Okay, just kill them all in one

845
02:39:17,579 --> 02:39:25,059
hit. Or the mages. No, I want to be away from those. Kill them all. 165. I just killed over

846
02:39:25,059 --> 02:39:36,549
a hundred. Didn't I? Wait, only what? I only killed eight? No, who died? Yeah, I killed a

847
02:39:36,549 --> 02:39:43,209
hundred. All right, now we're gonna meet you halfway. I'm coming up this way. What's your

848
02:39:43,209 --> 02:39:51,799
movement here? Five. Seven. I'm gonna move like here. Same with you. You can go that way as well.

849
02:39:54,620 --> 02:40:11,819
Balls into the same thing. Dead. Just dead. Good. Nulls come in. Priority is still the titans so

850
02:40:13,180 --> 02:40:26,379
or yeah they are. I now can let's heal you. Exactly what I wanted you to do.

851
02:40:26,379 --> 02:40:36,309
That's exactly what I wanted. So now I think I'm gonna fly you down here. Let's go from

852
02:40:36,309 --> 02:40:47,500
this angle so I'm not surrounded. Maybe I'll fly you down into the mages. 21 mages perish.

853
02:40:48,139 --> 02:40:51,579
You still have to walk all the way. Good. I don't care if you kill them.

854
02:40:52,379 --> 02:41:00,260
That's fine with me. I'm gonna go genies. Yeah, I definitely attacked the genies from

855
02:41:00,260 --> 02:41:03,219
this side because I want to be able to move the hydras over here too.

856
02:41:08,709 --> 02:41:13,239
13 genies dead. Again. Actually, you know what? Let's kill the genies.

857
02:41:14,040 --> 02:41:22,569
Oh, no, no, no, no. You go up here. These titans are gonna come to the archers. Let me see here.

858
02:41:23,290 --> 02:41:30,229
Ice bolt again on the two. Yeah, you can stick right behind

859
02:41:31,110 --> 02:41:38,069
because he's gonna kill the null and make one swing so might as well just block it so he

860
02:41:38,069 --> 02:41:49,979
can't get to the archers. Absolutely crumbled. One last shot. It's okay. You're not that

861
02:41:49,979 --> 02:42:14,780
strong. Nice. Genies dead. He's not dead. He's still alive. Miraculously. Kill the

862
02:42:16,059 --> 02:42:28,020
genies. Get rid of them. The mage. Now we just have to deal with you.

863
02:42:34,360 --> 02:42:44,329
All right. What do I got? Weakness. I can't cast it. Don't have any more. No, I can do

864
02:42:44,809 --> 02:43:20,170
bloodlust on the greater basilisks. Surround! You're pretty beefy. One left. Can I do like

865
02:43:20,170 --> 02:43:26,219
a magic arrow? Fuck. No bloodlust. Looks like you're just gonna have to hang out over here.

866
02:43:30,569 --> 02:43:43,659
No! Damn it! Come on. One fucking left. You retreat with one person left?

867
02:43:44,299 --> 02:43:51,100
That's so infuriating. I think you shouldn't be able to retreat if you've been in the match for

868
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:58,860
more than like a minute. What the fuck? If you've been fighting for like two minutes,

869
02:43:58,860 --> 02:44:05,579
I think you retreat is not an option. You could go with one person left and you can run away

870
02:44:05,579 --> 02:44:12,579
and keep all your stuff. Uh-uh. Come on. The game's 20 years old. I know. I know,

871
02:44:12,579 --> 02:44:25,030
but I'm fucking mad. That's pretty good. I'm gonna get that. No, this is mine now.

872
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:36,940
That's all you got left is this. You don't have anything, really. I'm gonna hang out back here.

873
02:44:37,739 --> 02:44:51,540
No, let me see here. What if you not build? I need this citadel. Capital. But if you come,

874
02:44:51,540 --> 02:45:01,530
he might come back. What about my original house? You know orange? Okay, orange is now

875
02:45:01,530 --> 02:45:05,610
retreating this way. I think orange is gonna come try to take my old house

876
02:45:06,329 --> 02:45:13,510
because I just took his. It's just we're never ending, never ending trade houses with

877
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:27,989
each other. He didn't even lead me anything. Maybe just get a level two. No capital. Like,

878
02:45:27,989 --> 02:45:38,069
I gotta wait. Um, I need to go out and just start taking stuff. So come on out.

879
02:45:38,629 --> 02:45:49,459
I've got this already. One attack. Yeah, just get out here and get it.

880
02:45:50,260 --> 02:46:02,739
There's a sanctuary right here. Fucking red. Orange. Green. Plus one attack permanently.

881
02:46:03,700 --> 02:46:22,010
That's too luck. Got a gold mine down here. I still can't afford anything. Retake the old capital?

882
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:33,780
Just AFK in the sanctuary forever. I don't think I can do that. Medusas. I'll take them.

883
02:46:33,780 --> 02:46:37,059
The magic plane. This is also...

884
02:46:39,139 --> 02:46:42,489
Uh, it's been deserted. This cyclops tower. I want to get this.

885
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:51,219
Shit, I want that gold mine. Or should I just... I'm already up here. Hold on.

886
02:46:54,899 --> 02:47:11,989
War Machine Factory. I already got it. Or this way. Just recruit a thousand chaos hydras. I could.

887
02:47:12,790 --> 02:47:20,360
Observatory. Let's get a good look. So this is a lot of orange and then red is up here.

888
02:47:21,319 --> 02:47:36,149
So I could take this stuff. I want that gold mine. Yeah, let's get the gold mine.

889
02:47:41,719 --> 02:47:46,469
I don't want to be left out in the open here. I'm gonna grab this too.

890
02:47:47,590 --> 02:47:54,709
Is anybody else down here? I don't think anyone else is over here.

891
02:47:57,110 --> 02:47:59,909
New capital! Welcome to the new capital!

892
02:48:03,610 --> 02:48:14,170
4,000 gold a day. It's like we never left. I'm leaving the town undefended.

893
02:48:14,889 --> 02:48:17,770
Yeah, the town is really undefended, but there's nobody really up here.

894
02:48:18,329 --> 02:48:24,040
It would take at least like three or four days for someone to even get over here.

895
02:48:24,760 --> 02:48:28,200
They're all down here. They're all fucking each other up down there.

896
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:37,479
All right, here we go. We got some population now.

897
02:48:39,639 --> 02:48:46,180
You are here. He's down here. Good. I hope you go down there and fucking have a problem

898
02:48:46,180 --> 02:48:57,350
with Tan. Because I'm going to take you over here. I'm not going to be that

899
02:48:57,350 --> 02:49:03,959
zealous. I'm just going to get this on the way back. Can I get under here?

900
02:49:04,840 --> 02:49:20,680
I can get this too. I have one zombie garrison. Yeah, this. Now I'm going to head back.

901
02:49:22,280 --> 02:49:26,500
I could take that stuff too. Let's just head back. I'm going to the sanctuary.

902
02:49:27,219 --> 02:49:35,260
Chaos hydras. All right, thankfully this guy had everything equipped. Everything was done.

903
02:49:35,899 --> 02:49:46,360
So let's get on. Let's buy some stuff. He doesn't have the lizard warriors though.

904
02:49:47,159 --> 02:49:57,319
He does. Hold on. Yeah, he does. Okay. Okay, let's head back there and try to stock up.

905
02:49:57,319 --> 02:50:17,590
Is he playing with one hero? Well, the problem is I'm trying to get like enough of an army

906
02:50:17,590 --> 02:50:25,510
where I can have a second hero that is safe. So everyone has so much better stuff than I do.

907
02:50:26,309 --> 02:50:32,069
So if I make a new hero right now, right, then I'm going to be thin. And if I get attacked,

908
02:50:32,950 --> 02:50:42,940
then it's all dead. That just happened. I was trying to build a second army to take another

909
02:50:42,940 --> 02:50:49,100
person out, but I keep getting just so far behind because they end up getting over here

910
02:50:49,100 --> 02:50:58,420
much quicker than I can. So I can get another hero here, but I'm going to have like not a

911
02:50:58,420 --> 02:51:04,540
whole lot of stuff. And I just lost my capital, so it's even harder to keep more

912
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:27,670
than one person. Can I go ahead and snipe these? I can. All right, next day. All right,

913
02:51:27,670 --> 02:51:40,329
Tan just killed somebody. Tan just killed Orange's, I think Orange's last defense.

914
02:51:43,989 --> 02:51:56,200
That's not good. Tan becoming super power. All right, let's take this and then get the

915
02:51:56,200 --> 02:52:08,649
fuck out of here. I have almost this whole upper quadrant here completed. Okay, give me a

916
02:52:08,649 --> 02:52:26,010
tavern. Demaniac. Demaniac. I mean, imps or intelligence. I feel like I'd want this.

917
02:52:26,969 --> 02:53:01,700
It's got like imps. No, I'm going with Andra. Take you out and go exploring because I can't

918
02:53:01,700 --> 02:53:16,139
really wait around. I can head this way. Stack? No, if I stack, I can only stack on like one

919
02:53:16,139 --> 02:53:21,500
person. If I play as one person, I'm too concentrated. If I'm not concentrated,

920
02:53:22,379 --> 02:53:27,350
you know, I have to try to do like two heroes. I can't just like stuff somebody in here and

921
02:53:27,350 --> 02:53:36,010
stack forever. I could try to get the old castle, but look at this. This guy, this dude is,

922
02:53:36,809 --> 02:53:42,950
this dude's ready to rock. I was thinking about going for whatever Orange, this is Orange's

923
02:53:42,950 --> 02:53:50,409
castle. This is Orange's final castle. I might just go try to get it because that,

924
02:53:50,409 --> 02:53:58,700
this is Orange just got killed by Tan. Remember, I might go try to get the other

925
02:53:58,700 --> 02:54:09,459
castle from Orange. Let me see. I've got enough. It's worth a try, I think. Let's save it

926
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:37,319
because he just got wiped out. Is it worth a shot? Yeah, let's go. I'm going for it.

927
02:54:37,319 --> 02:54:41,479
You did the thing that I did. Are you sure this is not me playing in a different timeline?

928
02:54:54,069 --> 02:55:02,309
All right, I need to take a look. What do you have over here? I can't see. I can't see

929
02:55:02,309 --> 02:55:09,850
what you have. All right, you looking all right. I'll take you out in a minute.

930
02:55:10,409 --> 02:55:25,620
Let's just hope you don't come attack me and kill me. There he is. Okay. I thought that

931
02:55:25,620 --> 02:55:31,270
was another person. Hold on. Who's in there? I just want to see what's in there.

932
02:55:33,399 --> 02:55:43,639
Lots pack, several throng, lots, lots. I can get it. You don't have any big units. I do.

933
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:51,430
I'm about to destroy, I'm about to wipe out Orange. Orange's gonna be out of the game.

934
02:55:51,430 --> 02:56:01,780
You just killed my hydras. All right. They don't have any big units. They don't have

935
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:15,270
any. They just have naga queens. Earthquake. Fuck. I don't have any spell points. No.

936
02:56:15,989 --> 02:56:29,500
Okay. Fireball. I had to rest. Yeah, but I had to like go all the way back and then all the

937
02:56:29,500 --> 02:56:38,149
way back down here. I don't have any MP, you know. I can icebolt like the naga queens.

938
02:56:38,870 --> 02:56:51,319
That's all I can do. Or bloodlust somebody. I get bloodlust. They don't really have like

939
02:56:51,319 --> 02:56:59,290
much of a defense though. Bloodlust the bulls. Bloodlust the wyverns. I would probably bloodlust

940
02:56:59,290 --> 02:57:09,430
the wyverns and just get them in there. Or the basilisks. The rangers. Doesn't it only

941
02:57:09,430 --> 02:57:15,750
work on, it's only melee, right? Didn't we find that out before? Hand to hand damage, yeah.

942
02:57:16,549 --> 02:57:26,040
I'm gonna do it on the wyvern and then I'm just gonna fly like almost in there.

943
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Maybe I shouldn't do it yet. I'm not gonna do it yet. I'm gonna do it like when

944
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:52,500
I'm about to attack somebody. Okay. Just start moving. Get over here. I'm so fucked.

945
02:57:59,049 --> 02:58:10,920
I'm just aiming at him and shoot him. I gotta get rid of the ones that have range. You need to die.

946
02:58:24,459 --> 02:58:28,940
I'm in trouble. I have better units but they can't get in because I don't have any mana.

947
02:58:29,659 --> 02:58:35,129
So we might have to go back to timeline two here unless I can fly in here and just

948
02:58:35,129 --> 02:58:45,030
cause a fucking problem. I can't, I don't have any mana to use spells. Like I have 12 points.

949
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:55,290
I can't use these. Yeah, I'm safe scum in this. I'm gonna save scum. It's not worth it.

950
02:58:57,049 --> 02:59:11,909
I might eventually get in there but it's not worth it. And I can get some more heroes too.

951
02:59:12,549 --> 02:59:18,760
And then I'll make my way over to orange. Hopefully I don't get attacked by them.

952
02:59:19,399 --> 02:59:27,799
Remember when you said, he's coming in right now. He's fucking right here, isn't he?

953
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:41,739
Where is he? I just like saw his unit. All right, give me my spell power and I'm going to wipe out.

954
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:52,200
I'm not sure it's worth taking these and then I could buy more.

955
02:59:56,950 --> 03:00:07,110
All right, back to, this guy doesn't have anything. 10 push-ups for every reload.

956
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:23,670
All right, how much mana do I have? I have 12 out of 100. Isn't there a way I can

957
03:00:24,309 --> 03:00:35,370
one of the spells kept within? How do I, isn't there a way I can replenish them?

958
03:00:36,090 --> 03:00:54,549
Let me just do this because it's there. I gotta get him out. Is that auto? Who's barking?

959
03:00:55,510 --> 03:01:01,450
Who's barking? Let me see who's barking. I'll be right back.

960
03:01:01,450 --> 03:01:04,489
I want to go see, seems like somebody's in the door or something.

961
03:01:04,489 --> 03:01:08,309
I haven't taken a break yet anyway so let me see what's going on. I'll be right back.

962
03:01:09,030 --> 03:03:09,000
Okay, we're good. We're good. This is really good music, you're right. It's very good.

963
03:03:10,229 --> 03:03:19,909
Okay, so you go into town because you need to be like in the town inside and then you go and

964
03:03:19,909 --> 03:03:28,790
visit the town. All right, everyone's comfortable. Everyone's good. Spend a night and then it's

965
03:03:28,790 --> 03:03:41,129
time to go take over orange. Orange, in fact, is leaving. I don't, I think orange is now

966
03:03:41,129 --> 03:03:52,120
unguarded. This is going to be perfect. So now let's go like this. You got everything.

967
03:03:52,120 --> 03:04:00,200
You got 100 spell points, yep. Come on out of there and let's try to get you some

968
03:04:00,200 --> 03:04:08,069
people next week. You have to stay in there. You, all right, here we go. Let's save it.

969
03:04:09,030 --> 03:04:27,510
That's not a save. That is. This is still timeline two. I'm ready. How do I get over here

970
03:04:27,510 --> 03:04:37,059
without him? Hopefully he doesn't see me. Although I could send the other guy out to

971
03:04:37,059 --> 03:04:40,340
take this stuff back but I feel like I'll just get killed. Somebody will attack me

972
03:04:40,340 --> 03:04:58,840
if it has more stuff. He's down here. He's gonna get implemented straight up. It's gonna

973
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:11,399
take him a while. It'll take him a while. Now he's coming back down. Tan just has so much.

974
03:05:14,379 --> 03:05:24,149
Tan has a fucking ton of stuff. He's got like three heroes. Me and orange have one. I think

975
03:05:24,149 --> 03:05:33,319
red only has one or two. Okay, well we got some dwellings. I have money so let's just at

976
03:05:33,319 --> 03:05:48,680
least make, let's start a secondary unit here. Okay, wear the gold mine back. I think I can get

977
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:55,299
this uncontested and then he's fucked. Yep, I think he's gonna have to backtrack and come get

978
03:05:55,299 --> 03:06:20,649
me. Should I? No. Should I leave everybody in the garrison? He won't be able to get through but

979
03:06:22,649 --> 03:06:32,569
no. I don't know if that's a good idea. Just scum it. It might work. Let's see. Okay,

980
03:06:32,569 --> 03:06:44,549
let's see if I, let's see what timeline happens when I don't do that. He's coming up. Time to

981
03:06:44,549 --> 03:06:54,299
change capitals again. He's coming up for this one. He might not. If I can have two castles,

982
03:06:54,299 --> 03:07:02,379
I'll be fucking happy. You ain't got nobody in there, man. There's like not very many people

983
03:07:02,379 --> 03:07:20,329
in there. Give it to me. Here we go. Earthquake. Boom. I'm flying in. Should I not?

984
03:07:20,329 --> 03:07:28,889
How many do I have? 19? No, don't fly in. I only have one range unit. I'm gonna get closer,

985
03:07:28,889 --> 03:07:42,659
though. I'm gonna get closer up this way. You get closer down here. Cast any dumb spells.

986
03:07:42,659 --> 03:07:46,100
That's fine. I'm gonna retaliate. Now you just killed, you just absolutely killed yourself.

987
03:07:47,219 --> 03:07:55,959
So far so good. Let's get closer. We're gonna, I want to get, keep everybody like near the

988
03:07:55,959 --> 03:08:20,659
front door because it's gonna open. Dead? All right, earthquake. Who needs a heal?

989
03:08:21,540 --> 03:08:32,819
Don't do it. What are you doing? He's like, I think I'm gonna open the door. Do you see

990
03:08:32,819 --> 03:08:49,370
them? I don't think I can see them over this height. I'm gonna, not yet. If he opens the

991
03:08:49,370 --> 03:08:57,850
door, I'm not even gonna send them in. No, just wait. I think I'm just gonna wait. If

992
03:08:57,850 --> 03:09:01,530
he opens the door, just come on out. Whatever. There's nobody, nobody else has range.

993
03:09:02,409 --> 03:09:20,819
Oh, I can go in here. You can get in. I didn't even see that. Hey, anybody out here?

994
03:09:26,500 --> 03:09:40,760
Fucking idiot. All right, I'm taking this pretty uncontested. It's fairly uncontested. I'm okay

995
03:09:40,760 --> 03:09:53,100
with this. Anybody hear a noise? Well, now I can go in front door. I'm sitting on the gate.

996
03:09:53,899 --> 03:10:09,559
All right, it's time. Flying. Everybody go in. Now we just have some skeletons.

997
03:10:12,680 --> 03:10:18,840
Uh, yeah, now I killed the skeletons. Orange is about to be in very, very bad place.

998
03:10:19,719 --> 03:10:29,139
Defeated. Tons of experience. I only lost some archers and one. Yeah, I didn't lose very much.

999
03:10:30,569 --> 03:10:40,260
Basic ballistics for expert first aid. I feel like I want to like take expert first

1000
03:10:40,260 --> 03:10:53,479
aid just to get it out of here. It's been something to pick. I feel like we can get

1001
03:10:53,479 --> 03:11:07,930
better options. So this is what Orange has left. What does your house look like?

1002
03:11:08,729 --> 03:11:19,209
It's pretty stacked, actually. Yeah, it's stacked. Wall of knowledge. Yeah.

1003
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:26,840
Oh, look at this. He's got fucking units to spend. All right, now we can make another hero

1004
03:11:26,840 --> 03:11:33,030
and I can actually have them with a good army. I've got another castle.

1005
03:11:34,180 --> 03:11:49,540
It's protected. Just get in here. Get inside the castle. I also have this, which is starting

1006
03:11:49,540 --> 03:11:55,620
to be, I'm having a little bit of trouble, but I've got a okay defense here. Not good,

1007
03:11:55,620 --> 03:12:02,899
not great, not fantastic, bad, not good at all. And here he comes, but it's not that good.

1008
03:12:04,149 --> 03:12:13,030
It's good. It's good enough. He's got lots of like fucking bone dragon things. I just,

1009
03:12:13,030 --> 03:12:19,399
I need him to turn around or I need him to go like somewhere else. Orange is right here.

1010
03:12:19,399 --> 03:12:29,940
Please go fight Orange and kill him. And, but I could go kill him. No, he needs to go here.

1011
03:12:29,940 --> 03:12:38,340
They need to fight. Now I can start to claim this shit. Wait, do I have any

1012
03:12:38,579 --> 03:12:54,940
walking points left? Um, not enough to do that. Not enough. Okay, here we go. Don't come get me.

1013
03:12:57,350 --> 03:13:28,260
Oh, where's it going? Orange. Okay. Give me this. Give me this. Give me that. I need more money.

1014
03:13:28,899 --> 03:13:54,090
I got, how many marketplaces do I have? I've got tons of wood too. I need more shit. I do.

1015
03:13:54,090 --> 03:14:11,100
I have to. I'm going to do 150 of these and then like a hundred of these, 160, 180. I need units.

1016
03:14:11,100 --> 03:14:19,260
I just need more. And then I'm going to have a hero there too. All right. So I need, I just need

1017
03:14:19,260 --> 03:14:26,920
units. Bang. This is a, this is a decent army. Okay. This is a good, this is a decent fucking

1018
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:52,969
army to defend this house. It's not great, but it's not terrible. I wish I had teleport.

1019
03:14:52,969 --> 03:15:01,180
God damn, I wish I had teleport. So bad. If only I had teleport. Imagine if I had teleport.

1020
03:15:01,180 --> 03:15:15,350
I could get one, two. I could get them all. It's up and to the right. Okay. Where am I at?

1021
03:15:15,989 --> 03:15:26,420
I want to get, I could kill him. I think I'm going to go to, I think I'm going to go for it.

1022
03:15:27,139 --> 03:15:34,059
He's got nowhere to retreat to. I'm going to think I'm going to kill him. I'll get his

1023
03:15:34,059 --> 03:15:53,610
artifacts. And Orange is dead. How far away is Tan? Tan's right here. All right. I'm going to,

1024
03:15:53,610 --> 03:15:57,930
I'm going to sit in my hole. He might, they might actually, they might fight. I'm hiding.

1025
03:16:01,799 --> 03:16:14,420
It's time to hide with my two castles and my two armies. Tan claiming Tan. Orange is coming

1026
03:16:14,420 --> 03:16:33,659
back here. Orange is on the way back here. He has to claim a castle. He's done. Remember,

1027
03:16:33,659 --> 03:16:46,840
he only has a few days left. Anything else I can do up here? I want to save the money.

1028
03:16:47,479 --> 03:16:55,510
I mean, okay. Here's a game plan. I could send you out and then make a new hero and start

1029
03:16:55,510 --> 03:17:14,700
stacking. I think that is a ding. No. Bad plan. Do you think that's a good plan? I already

1030
03:17:14,700 --> 03:17:26,379
have a new, I already have a capital. I could get, how many Titans could I get? One. I

1031
03:17:26,459 --> 03:17:36,889
could get one super Titan and replace the Medusa. I need to restart my computer.

1032
03:17:40,500 --> 03:17:55,100
Have the other guys stack units of the other. Should I save the game? This is, I'll tell you,

1033
03:17:55,899 --> 03:18:01,340
this is crucial because I'm in a spot right now where I can start to stockpile minions and I

1034
03:18:01,340 --> 03:18:08,340
can eliminate another player. And then again, the week goes by and I've got like a couple of

1035
03:18:08,420 --> 03:18:17,700
really decent sized armies. This is crucial that this decision is done correctly. I have to go,

1036
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:23,159
I have to go this way and start to claim territories that Tan has over here.

1037
03:18:28,520 --> 03:18:34,200
Once Orange is done, I need to go this way and I actually, I have to start going over here.

1038
03:18:36,889 --> 03:18:40,649
There's no way I'm going to be able to take over Tan. Not right now. I need a few more

1039
03:18:40,649 --> 03:18:47,260
castles and I needed a little bit more of a minion stash. This is crucial. Let's go.

1040
03:18:55,829 --> 03:18:59,590
This is his last ditch effort. I'm going to get his artifacts. It's over. He loses.

1041
03:19:00,389 --> 03:19:12,540
What does he have? Queens. Let's get a little bit of ranged. I'm going to, let's see, Fireball or

1042
03:19:13,579 --> 03:19:26,340
I'm going to get rid of the ranged so we can do right here or right here. I can do right

1043
03:19:26,340 --> 03:19:38,180
there. That'll take out probably most of the stuff over this way. Do Earthquake on my own

1044
03:19:38,180 --> 03:19:50,739
house. That would be so, no, I'm not going to do Earthquake. I could do slow. Always slow.

1045
03:19:51,540 --> 03:20:07,450
Reduce the speed of all enemy units. Okay. I'm going to stick around. Just going to wait.

1046
03:20:08,329 --> 03:20:14,299
Nobody move. I have some range. Let them come to you. Nobody move. Nobody do anything.

1047
03:20:15,340 --> 03:20:31,770
Take out the wizard. Let them explode. We get to go twice. That's fine.

1048
03:20:34,819 --> 03:20:45,750
One queen is perished. Jewel Wizardry. It really is Jewel Wizardry. All right, who am I?

1049
03:20:48,520 --> 03:20:59,110
Jewel Wizardry! I can do that every time. Ten gargoyles perish. Thank god you're stupid.

1050
03:21:00,729 --> 03:21:06,420
Um, all right, just don't do anything. Don't move. Nobody move. They have to come to you.

1051
03:21:08,940 --> 03:21:25,879
No! They got the bottom down. That was a mistake. Seven genies dead. What? What are you thinking?

1052
03:21:27,219 --> 03:21:49,159
What the fuck even are you thinking? Six genies dead. I get to go again. Let's make it a

1053
03:21:49,159 --> 03:21:58,600
double. Minimal damage. Minimal. Minimal. Okay, looking good. He's through. That's fine. He's

1054
03:21:58,600 --> 03:22:19,510
dead. Are they? Did he? How did he? Oh, he flew. Okay. Twice. Nice. He's fucked. I wonder if

1055
03:22:19,510 --> 03:22:28,229
you're going to step on a landmine. What do you think? Rush him? No, not yet. Not yet.

1056
03:22:28,229 --> 03:22:35,860
Not until these guys are dead. If I can not take any damage from like any of these people,

1057
03:22:35,860 --> 03:22:49,940
that would be so happy. See, look. He's just like, duck. What the fuck are you doing?

1058
03:22:54,059 --> 03:23:07,479
Why would you do that? That was just BM. It was. He knew he was going to lose.

1059
03:23:14,899 --> 03:23:18,020
Don't let him come in. Who cares? They're not going to get in.

1060
03:23:18,739 --> 03:23:29,139
Let's go for the front, I guess. Why not? I'm actually not going for the majors.

1061
03:23:29,700 --> 03:23:38,860
He's to go all the way down. Oh no. Oh no. You punched me a couple times.

1062
03:23:40,420 --> 03:24:01,540
I'm scared. I'm scared. Give me all your stuff.

1063
03:24:06,840 --> 03:24:20,899
I'm scared. Don't shiver. Hold on. This item renders your

1064
03:24:20,899 --> 03:24:28,540
units immune to the curse spell. That's pretty great. One on the torso of this

1065
03:24:28,540 --> 03:24:33,620
item increases your power by plus two and the Crest of Valor increases your morale by plus one.

1066
03:24:34,579 --> 03:24:39,659
Advanced ballistics. Hey guys, I'm going to have low energy.

1067
03:24:43,139 --> 03:25:04,409
Yeah. Look at that. No! Fuck out of my way.

1068
03:25:04,409 --> 03:25:08,649
I did that. I vanquished the enemy. These streams are really weird.

1069
03:25:16,629 --> 03:25:24,219
Don't fake cry. That made me sad. Why? Because I systematically destroyed him.

1070
03:25:24,219 --> 03:25:31,459
I meticulously destroyed him. I was the one that killed Orange. Nobody else did anything

1071
03:25:31,459 --> 03:25:36,819
to him. I took out his ground units. I took out his cemented into the ground units,

1072
03:25:36,819 --> 03:25:42,139
which are castles. He had no chance. I'm okay with this.

1073
03:25:42,700 --> 03:25:58,100
Let me make sure I have all this stuff equipped. I do, right? Power's pretty good.

1074
03:26:02,729 --> 03:26:09,159
You going? I just hurt myself. I just like, I can't even describe what I just did. I just

1075
03:26:09,159 --> 03:26:17,110
closed my legs tightly around and I spun around and that hurt a lot. All right. We're

1076
03:26:17,110 --> 03:26:25,030
almost at a new week. I've got time now. I have enough time to send

1077
03:26:26,229 --> 03:26:36,340
you packing. Out here. I'm going to go up to red. I'm going to try to find my way this way.

1078
03:26:36,979 --> 03:26:39,139
I'm not going to leave this place empty handed because I'm going to make another

1079
03:26:39,139 --> 03:26:50,010
hero and I'm going to make this castle defending. Check it out. All right. Which

1080
03:26:50,010 --> 03:26:56,420
like YouTube thumbnail am I going to use? Which YouTuber click this video thumbnail?

1081
03:26:56,420 --> 03:27:20,299
They're both equally. There's level four barbarian specialty in ogres. Yeah. All

1082
03:27:20,299 --> 03:27:30,059
right. Should I be the YouTuber? Put my face on every thumbnail or every iPad game

1083
03:27:30,620 --> 03:27:34,729
that has released in the last three years. This is an important decision.

1084
03:27:41,100 --> 03:27:50,149
I think we have to do with the YouTube. Yeah. Well, I got to, I got to move on out.

1085
03:27:50,790 --> 03:27:58,469
I got to like move this person out of the way. He's level four too. I mean,

1086
03:27:58,469 --> 03:28:08,819
I have to look for bingo. All right. Let's get you some people. How about some titans?

1087
03:28:09,459 --> 03:28:15,129
We're going to build you up. I'm going to take this person out of here. All right.

1088
03:28:15,129 --> 03:28:20,409
Everything's just fine. We're starting to become a power. Tan is looking very strong.

1089
03:28:21,049 --> 03:28:28,540
Red's looking a little on the weak side. I think I'm going to take you.

1090
03:28:29,260 --> 03:28:39,459
You need, Oh, you're in town. You know what? What? Everything's claimed. I'm going to leave

1091
03:28:39,459 --> 03:28:47,379
that castle protected. Come over here. Get this mine in here. He's fucking diluted.

1092
03:28:52,940 --> 03:28:57,020
Hey, I'm, I'm making it to like the final three. I'm okay with that. Tan is a lot

1093
03:28:57,020 --> 03:29:02,459
of stuff, but if I can, if Dan, if tan does not end up coming up here immediately,

1094
03:29:03,020 --> 03:29:11,799
it's going to be hard for him to take this castle. I wonder if I should just

1095
03:29:11,799 --> 03:29:17,989
fuck it and just start moving. I'm going to have to move. I'm going to get this.

1096
03:29:17,989 --> 03:29:29,020
And I mean, that's just money. I need it. Tan's got everything. This is going to be,

1097
03:29:29,020 --> 03:29:33,500
this is going to be all reds. Red's gone. Orange gone. Red gone. I think,

1098
03:29:33,500 --> 03:29:54,229
I don't know who's left. It's just gray, green and tan. I think, no, it is just me.

1099
03:29:55,209 --> 03:30:11,700
Oh fuck. It's just me versus tan. No, no. Is it really me and tan? No, no, no.

1100
03:30:11,700 --> 03:30:29,020
This is still pink. Red, dead, tan. Pink was the first to die. Well, yeah, pink died in the very

1101
03:30:29,020 --> 03:30:40,790
beginning. Is it just me and tan? Did blue die? We're going to have to investigate over here.

1102
03:30:41,430 --> 03:30:48,389
It's investigation time. We need, I need to go this way. There's somebody in here.

1103
03:30:50,600 --> 03:31:05,659
Yeah, we've got to, it's, I'm investigating. Tan's coming up. Is there nobody left? Well,

1104
03:31:05,659 --> 03:31:16,620
get this back. Get the thousand experience. Let's break through this and go on the road.

1105
03:31:24,659 --> 03:31:44,540
Not a new week yet. No, what do we need? I need genies. Okay. I'm so, I'm really,

1106
03:31:44,540 --> 03:31:52,040
really confused about this. Let's see. Tan's got this all under control. Here he comes.

1107
03:31:53,479 --> 03:32:03,670
He's on this road down here. He's going to go this way. All right. Find out what's over

1108
03:32:03,670 --> 03:32:19,379
here. Anybody else in the chat smoke weed? All right. Well, I just killed that guy in a second.

1109
03:32:20,020 --> 03:32:43,219
What's over here? Nothing. It's not a road. Dwarf college. Where's he heading? No, I don't

1110
03:32:43,219 --> 03:32:47,610
know. He's freaking me out. They just met in the middle there. He's coming. No, he went

1111
03:32:47,610 --> 03:32:57,209
down again. I don't want any dwarfs. No. What the fuck is that? I've made it across.

1112
03:32:57,209 --> 03:33:55,770
Homestead archers. No, this is all tan left. He's here. He won't make it. Get it. One hit.

1113
03:33:55,770 --> 03:34:15,530
Nice. Okay. So now we've got a bubbling cauldron. Where am I? Where's tan on this road?

1114
03:34:15,530 --> 03:34:27,430
No, not yet. All right. We've got more defense here. More of these stacking up some units.

1115
03:34:29,979 --> 03:34:33,659
This one's the one that's in most danger. I think they're ignoring it over here.

1116
03:34:40,809 --> 03:34:52,680
Tan? He's going down to get elementals. A thousand experience. Give me it. Fountain of Youth.

1117
03:34:53,319 --> 03:35:08,790
Well, I can't tell what's up there. I'm going back to the road. Oh, what's this? Mage tower.

1118
03:35:11,620 --> 03:35:34,059
It's mage's uncharted territory. I need to save. No, I have to. More of these wyverns.

1119
03:35:36,149 --> 03:35:46,149
More donkeys. Archers. I'm fucking nervous right now. He's got two really, really stacked

1120
03:35:46,149 --> 03:35:58,729
heroes. He might even have three. Enchanted Spring. Water wheel. Enchanted Spring. Pegasi.

1121
03:35:58,729 --> 03:36:22,600
I don't want Pegasi. Sanctuary. Fuck. You don't have a castle over here? You got this one.

1122
03:36:23,319 --> 03:36:31,270
You've got to have a castle back here. Stuffed back here. You have to. Get in the sanctuary.

1123
03:36:32,149 --> 03:36:39,209
There's got to be a castle back there. There has to be a stuffed crust castle back there.

1124
03:36:39,209 --> 03:36:50,520
Oh, don't say that. I can't eat that. I can't eat any food for like the next

1125
03:36:51,239 --> 03:37:08,569
two or three days. This is pretty barren here. I have titans. He's coming up. No,

1126
03:37:08,569 --> 03:37:13,129
he's just claiming every resource. He has so much money. He's got so many resources.

1127
03:37:13,129 --> 03:37:20,649
I'm fucking... Look at this. He's got the whole map. It's just me and Tan. It has to be.

1128
03:37:27,180 --> 03:37:32,020
I've got to snipe some of these resources from him. It's so far away.

1129
03:37:32,659 --> 03:37:58,739
That's plus one attack. I've got all I can buy. I've got to go back to the other place.

1130
03:37:59,540 --> 03:38:07,479
I'm okay with this defense. I can't do any more titans. I can do naga queens. I can do one.

1131
03:38:07,479 --> 03:38:18,600
This is it. He's coming in for the kill. He's coming in for the kill shot right now.

1132
03:38:20,389 --> 03:38:23,909
There better be something right at the end of this road. He's coming in for the kill shot.

1133
03:38:23,909 --> 03:38:32,069
He's right here. Let's just check. Let's see what's at the end of the road.

1134
03:38:50,420 --> 03:39:05,829
Fuck. It's right here. I'm gonna get it. That would have been too far away. I think we abandoned

1135
03:39:05,829 --> 03:39:15,000
this castle, I think. I'm gonna get another titan. Do I abandon the castle? Should I

1136
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:20,219
hide over here and then run away? I could take all these units out of here and run the fuck

1137
03:39:20,219 --> 03:40:02,219
away. What do I got for resources? It's time to kneel. I'm not kneeling. I don't kneel for

1138
03:40:02,219 --> 03:40:22,819
kings I don't believe in. I got 10,000. I can get two more titans. I think I'm gonna get them

1139
03:40:22,819 --> 03:40:29,959
out of here. I'm gonna have like somebody sneak out the back. Eight titans. Those are very

1140
03:40:29,959 --> 03:40:45,700
damaging. Look at this. They're fucking 40 to 60 damage ranged. Stay in the fort. Just stay

1141
03:40:45,700 --> 03:41:00,180
in here. Do not sneak out the back. Make him pay in blood. You think I can win with eight

1142
03:41:00,180 --> 03:41:07,299
titans just throwing lightning bolts? I don't know if I can do that. I think I take... Here's

1143
03:41:07,299 --> 03:41:15,110
my plan, okay? Let me tell you my plan. I think I take the titans and I fucking run them away.

1144
03:41:15,829 --> 03:41:20,340
This is like $80,000 worth of stuff. I'm gonna run them. I'm getting out.

1145
03:41:20,979 --> 03:41:30,180
I can get out of here. You're gonna give them the titans? No, no. Let me just...

1146
03:41:30,180 --> 03:41:40,219
Just hear me out on this. Just wait. He's right there. Fuck. If he was like over here,

1147
03:41:40,219 --> 03:41:51,979
I would have just like ran through the gate. Oh well. Just gonna defend. I might actually

1148
03:41:51,979 --> 03:41:59,719
sell some resources to get some more mages. He's coming with like a gigantic fucking force too.

1149
03:41:59,719 --> 03:42:29,670
This is so bad. Does this guy have anything like leveled up? I can get some of them.

1150
03:42:30,790 --> 03:42:41,290
Well, at least I have more range. Okay. Save the game. This is timeline two. We're just

1151
03:42:41,290 --> 03:42:48,170
still in it. I'm about to go up to his castle up here. Maybe he sees, maybe he can

1152
03:42:48,170 --> 03:42:51,370
see that. And he's like, wait a minute. That's not a good idea. And he pulls back.

1153
03:42:59,909 --> 03:43:07,139
Split up the titans. Should I do like two, four, six, eight? Should I do or like four and four?

1154
03:43:07,139 --> 03:43:22,069
Two, four, six, eight? No. Keep them together. No, no. Okay. All right. I'm just thinking

1155
03:43:22,069 --> 03:43:26,489
maybe that would be an interesting thing to do. I could send out like an envoy to meet

1156
03:43:26,489 --> 03:43:44,010
him with like four fucking orcs. Let him come. This is it. He fucking ran away. He ran away.

1157
03:43:44,010 --> 03:43:52,899
He didn't fight me. And now I'm going to get his castle. Oh, you have a lot of people in here.

1158
03:43:54,010 --> 03:44:01,290
You've got a few, a horde, lots of throng, lots of throng. This ain't going to happen.

1159
03:44:09,059 --> 03:44:42,329
Okay. Earthquake. Here we go. Catapult. Catapult right here. Right there. And that's not

1160
03:44:42,329 --> 03:44:53,739
where I aimed. All right. I got to play this smart. I aimed like right here. Why did they go down

1161
03:44:53,739 --> 03:45:08,979
here? Chaos hydras. I'm going in. I just have to go in and try. Oh, it can miss.

1162
03:45:10,920 --> 03:45:14,280
Everybody just has to try to get in here and kill the hydra as fast as possible. And then

1163
03:45:14,280 --> 03:45:31,420
everything else should not be too horrible. Poison. I had to try. I gotta, I have to

1164
03:45:31,420 --> 03:45:40,809
get the fuck in here. Uh, what's more favorable? Probably versus the fireflies.

1165
03:45:44,459 --> 03:46:05,430
Archers. I can't really get over there. I could fly over here. Just like wait. Good.

1166
03:46:11,239 --> 03:46:29,260
They go away. I'm going to, I'm going to keep aiming it down here. The bull. I mean, I'm

1167
03:46:29,260 --> 03:46:45,450
just going to try to get the bottom. If I go for here, the fucking hydra. 250.

1168
03:46:53,940 --> 03:47:10,409
Get to go again. Take another one down. Open the front door. What are you thinking? Oh my

1169
03:47:10,409 --> 03:47:17,239
God. That's so good. Come on. If I get this castle, I'm back in the game for real. And it's

1170
03:47:17,239 --> 03:47:20,920
done very, it's very possible. All right. I can do earthquake again, or I can do something else.

1171
03:47:21,719 --> 03:47:35,370
But before I do earthquake, let me see if this breaks. If this breaks, then I don't need to do

1172
03:47:35,370 --> 03:47:49,579
earthquake. Don't need to do earthquake. I'm in. Now I'm going to do something else. I'm

1173
03:47:49,579 --> 03:47:58,379
going to do either fireball or lightning bolt. Fireball on. Now it hits me too. Doesn't

1174
03:47:58,379 --> 03:48:07,540
it? What we can do. We have expert, right? Expert stone skin. That's not a good, that's

1175
03:48:07,540 --> 03:48:19,610
not a bad idea. Do I have it though? Let's do it. All right. Continue to destroy. I want you

1176
03:48:20,409 --> 03:48:33,659
archers. The bulls. Holy fucking hell. The bulls. The bulls. The bulls. I'm going to,

1177
03:48:33,659 --> 03:48:53,129
I'm going to get it. I'm going to get this. It's so powerful. They're so powerful.

1178
03:48:55,540 --> 03:49:05,399
They're like too powerful. Let's keep killing these guys down. Heal bulls.

1179
03:49:14,920 --> 03:49:34,739
That's good. Noel's dead. That's it.

1180
03:49:37,989 --> 03:49:52,840
I got way more than you. This is a victory. I'm going to lose the archer's butt.

1181
03:49:53,000 --> 03:50:05,579
It's okay. The bull might be the best unit that I have. I'm just going to stack them forever.

1182
03:50:06,459 --> 03:50:17,799
Can I? Really? I can hit that guy? I can't. Oh, you can. That's funny. All right. Get in

1183
03:50:17,799 --> 03:50:42,340
here. Ow. These ones are still up here. No, sorry. Just wait. Get the bulls in here.

1184
03:50:43,379 --> 03:50:46,819
What the hell? No. What the fuck is going on? I can't believe it. I knew that was

1185
03:50:47,780 --> 03:50:52,819
going to happen. Don't worry. Oh, I hate this game. I tried to click them. The game's fun.

1186
03:50:53,620 --> 03:51:18,059
I just took his capital. Normal maximum spell points by 50%. That's insane. Or expert ballistics.

1187
03:51:20,700 --> 03:51:25,180
Two aim shots at maximum damage. Either one of these is really, really good.

1188
03:51:25,819 --> 03:51:49,000
Here's the capital. I need bulls. All right. What do you got? You've already cleaned yourself

1189
03:51:49,000 --> 03:51:53,239
out completely here. I mean, I can get all of these. Might as well just because I'm running

1190
03:51:53,239 --> 03:52:03,420
out of people. Don't have an artifact. I got to make an artifact merchant. So I got three

1191
03:52:03,420 --> 03:52:10,700
cities. And now that I have this, I can start to move around a little bit. Is it really just

1192
03:52:10,700 --> 03:52:20,739
me and Tan? I'm so fucked. This is not a bad force. I got to come out and start claiming

1193
03:52:20,739 --> 03:52:30,389
stuff. I can come out. This person's not scary at all. You know what I mean? Like, I think

1194
03:52:30,950 --> 03:52:43,540
I'm pretty sure I can take that person. What do you got? This is the one that has the power.

1195
03:52:45,159 --> 03:52:51,420
He has the swarm of the pixies. He has the highest unit. I think he has three heroes.

1196
03:52:52,059 --> 03:52:58,860
I could snipe some more of these castles. That's exactly what I'm going to fucking do.

1197
03:52:59,500 --> 03:53:05,959
Not that one. I'm going to go down here. See, there we go. Right here. You've got like a

1198
03:53:05,959 --> 03:53:35,129
pack. That would be a fight. Here comes a new week. Chaos hydrants. Bulls. Get them all.

1199
03:53:36,010 --> 03:53:45,379
This is turning out to be a pretty good army. All right. I need to leave here and

1200
03:53:45,379 --> 03:53:58,149
start claiming. I got to start picking stuff up. You know, I got to start to tap into

1201
03:53:58,149 --> 03:54:01,989
his resources. At least come out and grab some of the stuff that he took before.

1202
03:54:14,059 --> 03:54:23,129
Yeah, I lost my swamp. I could start to come out and go on the open field here.

1203
03:54:23,129 --> 03:54:30,420
I have pretty decent army. Who is this guy? This guy that just came in the front door. Who

1204
03:54:30,420 --> 03:54:48,340
are you? Several. Horde. Several. This is going to be a fight. I got fucking six chaos dragons.

1205
03:54:53,579 --> 03:55:13,459
I can repel them. Ten, eighteen, fifty, four, six. I could sell resources, but I don't

1206
03:55:13,459 --> 03:55:18,969
know if he's going to come do it. Several means, what, five to ten? Or is it ten to

1207
03:55:18,969 --> 03:55:33,270
twenty? A few is like up to five, right? Up to ten. Five to nine. It's going to be a fight,

1208
03:55:33,270 --> 03:55:42,579
but I have it. I think I might, I'll be able to do it. Oh fuck. They're closing in. Hold on a

1209
03:55:42,579 --> 03:55:49,459
minute here. What do I got in here? I think I, I got eight titans. I think I meet them in

1210
03:55:49,459 --> 03:56:06,200
the open field. I think I can do it. Two more titans. I got to load that guy up with titans.

1211
03:56:09,450 --> 03:56:15,959
All right. I'm going to start to claim. I got to start to move around. I haven't been down

1212
03:56:15,959 --> 03:56:25,610
here. There might be another castle. It might not even be fortified. Well, time to save. This is

1213
03:56:25,610 --> 03:56:38,059
where we find out what might happen here. Let's see what happens. No, he's not coming.

1214
03:56:38,780 --> 03:56:55,590
He just wants the resources. Ice bolt, ice bolt, ice bolt, ice bolt, ice bolt. You don't

1215
03:56:55,590 --> 03:57:06,440
have ice bolt. How do you not have ice bolt? Ice bolt on the bird. Three. Here we go.

1216
03:57:09,180 --> 03:57:18,950
Oh, it's all right. This could happen. They have a lot of ranged. They have a lot of ranged.

1217
03:57:18,950 --> 03:57:23,190
I, do I, do I fly out and fucking attack the genie? I could go fly attack this genie right

1218
03:57:23,190 --> 03:57:39,770
now. All right. I might just focus on the bird. Bird focus. Come on. Ow. Kill bird.

1219
03:57:40,790 --> 03:57:55,819
Kill bird. He's got one left. Kill bird. Kill bird. I have a really good chance now.

1220
03:57:56,459 --> 03:57:59,819
Now everybody just fucking relax and hang out and don't do anything dumb.

1221
03:58:04,760 --> 03:58:17,540
I've got balls. I do. All right. The most important. These guys don't have range. No,

1222
03:58:17,540 --> 03:58:24,620
they do. They do. He split the Titans up. These wizards are the ones that have to die.

1223
03:58:29,340 --> 03:58:32,459
I got to get out there. I got it. I have to get out there. I got to fly out there.

1224
03:58:32,459 --> 03:58:37,590
I got to kill those wizards. I got to get out there now. You know, I got to get,

1225
03:58:37,590 --> 03:58:53,059
I got to get, I got to get out there. 331. Oh my god. All right. I think I, I have to.

1226
03:58:53,059 --> 03:58:58,680
Let me, wait. Lightning bolt. Ice bolt. Ice bolt. Ice or lightning? Versus the wizards.

1227
03:58:59,319 --> 03:59:10,309
Probably lightning. I could blind them too. Cannot move and cause it to counter attack

1228
03:59:10,309 --> 03:59:18,379
at half its normal attack strength. No, that doesn't, he can still attack. No,

1229
03:59:18,379 --> 03:59:20,219
blinding isn't going to work. We're going to do, we're going to zap.

1230
03:59:20,940 --> 03:59:41,930
Oh, I got, do I just fucking go out there?

1231
03:59:46,709 --> 03:59:51,350
I don't know. I think they just have to, just have to wait. Oh, I can hold it or just go in.

1232
03:59:52,229 --> 04:00:17,219
That's the only range they have. I'm going in. Oh, I've got to do this. I have to fly over

1233
04:00:17,219 --> 04:00:45,110
there and kill. I, I, 58. Oh no. It's like, whoa. They have too many units. There's too

1234
04:00:45,110 --> 04:00:58,729
many units. Fucking 400 of these things. Send the balls in. Just somebody kill these.

1235
04:00:59,530 --> 04:01:05,819
The titans can't even move. I'm going out the front door with the balls. Next

1236
04:01:05,819 --> 04:01:19,559
fucking attempt. They're dead. Dead. Come on. Kill them.

1237
04:01:25,000 --> 04:01:38,540
No, you're doing the stupid blessing. Get these pixies out of here. Okay. Should I dispel

1238
04:01:39,100 --> 04:01:49,000
or should I try ice bolt? I can't. I'm going to dispel them. I can't blind them.

1239
04:01:49,719 --> 04:01:51,399
I can't. I don't have enough spell points.

1240
04:01:51,399 --> 04:02:16,659
God damn it. Why was this guy so beefy? That's the only person that's been doing anything.

1241
04:02:17,299 --> 04:02:32,969
It's cause this hero like is level two. They realistically only have this. I still have 18

1242
04:02:32,969 --> 04:02:47,079
balls and I still have chaos fucking demons. I kind of have to just walk out the front door.

1243
04:02:47,799 --> 04:02:52,500
Like that's the sad part of this. I have to get out there. Like just go,

1244
04:02:53,219 --> 04:03:10,950
just go out the front door. Get the balls out there. Hurry.

1245
04:03:12,329 --> 04:03:22,299
All right. He brought the genies in. 18. Three genies die. I have to bring the balls out.

1246
04:03:22,860 --> 04:03:30,440
Or should I just kill the genies? They're just, they're in here. Five genies dead.

1247
04:03:30,440 --> 04:03:38,020
No, they just, they have too many of these guys. They have too many. They had so much

1248
04:03:38,020 --> 04:03:48,149
range. He just brought it. He had like fucking four ranged units. This is it. I lose.

1249
04:03:48,950 --> 04:04:02,780
Well, this person's literally just stepping in the swamp. I should have 2020 hindsight.

1250
04:04:02,780 --> 04:04:06,540
I should have only just, I should have brought everybody outside to attack the mages,

1251
04:04:06,540 --> 04:04:09,590
but then they would have just died. They would have just died.

1252
04:04:10,469 --> 04:04:20,229
Everybody that walked out the door would just die. This is a loss. The balls can't do

1253
04:04:20,229 --> 04:04:25,579
this on their own. I love how the shitty archers on the castle can do more damage than

1254
04:04:25,579 --> 04:04:39,450
like my people can do. Yeah, this is over. They are weakened. Yeah, but I've lost this

1255
04:04:39,450 --> 04:04:47,100
cow. I'm just, this tan owns almost the entire game. I mean, I'm just going to fucking,

1256
04:04:47,100 --> 04:05:20,379
whatever. I'm just going to die here. Well, they ain't going to have much, but at this stage,

1257
04:05:21,020 --> 04:05:26,540
I don't know. I don't think this is winnable. I don't, they have so much beef. They own the

1258
04:05:26,540 --> 04:05:35,989
whole game. I swear to God, if pink is just down here. No, it's all tan. They conquered

1259
04:05:35,989 --> 04:05:42,549
everything. Tan conquered. Okay. This is the stupidest damn thing. Listen to what happened here.

1260
04:05:43,590 --> 04:05:49,030
So one of these, like two or three of these fucking dumb fuck faces in the beginning of the

1261
04:05:49,030 --> 04:05:54,950
game, like pink and blue, whoever it was instantly lost. And I mean like instantly,

1262
04:05:54,950 --> 04:05:58,870
they lost everything. Tan just like walked into somebody's castle and just took it over

1263
04:06:00,229 --> 04:06:14,409
twice. And then so tan at the very beginning of the game had like three castles down here

1264
04:06:16,569 --> 04:06:21,049
and then just started to fucking poison everybody. And then I made it to the finals too. I'm okay

1265
04:06:21,049 --> 04:06:31,620
with this. Who's even in here? What's down here? I want to see what's down here. Get out of my way.

1266
04:06:34,340 --> 04:06:48,180
It's goddamn tan. Yeah, it's just me and tan. Fucking tan. Unbelievable. I can't believe it.

1267
04:06:48,180 --> 04:06:56,090
They took everything. They have everything. No, I can't lose in a 1v1. Who's in here?

1268
04:07:03,299 --> 04:07:16,700
Where's the ice pole? There's gotta be some castle that's unguarded. How do you have so

1269
04:07:16,700 --> 04:07:38,520
much guard everywhere? Well, I need money to make units. Oh my god. Yeah, from the very

1270
04:07:38,520 --> 04:07:45,340
beginning of the game. This is impossible. There's no, this is an unsurmountable no

1271
04:07:45,340 --> 04:07:53,299
victory would be. I can't do it. Impossible. I have to restart the game. I'm done. There's no

1272
04:07:53,299 --> 04:08:05,459
way. All right, so you know when you play risk and you're on Australia still and one of your

1273
04:08:05,459 --> 04:08:09,139
friends has every single other continent and every single other country in the game and it

1274
04:08:09,139 --> 04:08:15,219
gives you that look like uh what do you want to do here because you have like 200 troops

1275
04:08:15,219 --> 04:08:21,850
right at that bridge. That's just what I'm doing. I'm just pro I'm prolonging the game.

1276
04:08:30,899 --> 04:08:37,420
Hey dude, uh you want to get some like food or something? No, I'm not done playing the

1277
04:08:37,420 --> 04:08:47,959
game. Uh I mean it's impossible for you to win. I'm not done playing. All right um where do you

1278
04:08:47,959 --> 04:09:02,940
want to go? I would like to stay in Australia in fortified please. Okay yeah it is just like

1279
04:09:04,760 --> 04:09:12,200
that is no way. I have to just give up. Go to the tree house. Yeah, I didn't even

1280
04:09:12,200 --> 04:09:23,750
click that. I'm just I'm I'm clicking it. It's like eight heroes. Oh no they're coming from

1281
04:09:23,750 --> 04:09:42,809
my castle. What's wrong? He owns everything. He has like 10 castles. He has every single castle.

1282
04:09:45,780 --> 04:09:52,760
What is this? Oh that's me. That's so funny. I'm I made it to the final two. I'll take second

1283
04:09:52,760 --> 04:10:06,809
place. That's fine. He's just toying with me. Well, I mean I still have like 10. I could

1284
04:10:06,809 --> 04:10:19,909
just put make like 20 fucking titans. It's not over yet. It has not ended. He hasn't taken this

1285
04:10:19,909 --> 04:10:31,989
castle and I could I can make 20 titans. Get out of Australia. Stop it. Get get you're

1286
04:10:31,989 --> 04:10:36,870
not going to win. It I don't care how many troops you have on Australia. Here we go.

1287
04:10:37,989 --> 04:10:57,959
Biggest threat is what the hell is this? They shoot 63 of these fucking things.

1288
04:10:58,760 --> 04:11:12,360
Free to the mages. I think the mage is the worst and the ones that can fly. Oh boy. Okay well

1289
04:11:12,360 --> 04:11:29,219
hold on a minute here. It's not over yet. Just continue. Just buff the titan. Magic arrow

1290
04:11:29,219 --> 04:12:04,229
cure bless. Maximum damage. I haven't lost yet. Give it the titan again. Stay here.

1291
04:12:05,190 --> 04:12:20,739
I get to go again. Oh it's been breached. Okay we have blessing. We're gonna do

1292
04:12:21,700 --> 04:12:39,370
he already still has blessing right? I guess he's blessed right? Just fucking keep doing it. It's

1293
04:12:39,370 --> 04:12:54,780
very I can do this. How many points do I have? 17. I still have plenty. Stone skin on I'm gonna

1294
04:12:54,780 --> 04:13:05,719
say probably on the on the naga queens or just all in on the titan. Probably all in on titan.

1295
04:13:05,799 --> 04:13:25,340
That's what I'm gonna go for. You're in. It's okay. You're in but it don't matter. Now we all have

1296
04:13:25,340 --> 04:13:36,170
to focus on you. No. Get rid of them. Everybody just calm down. Just focus on the dragon that

1297
04:13:36,170 --> 04:13:54,229
just climbed in. Fucking pathetic. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. 14. Titan come on. Titans

1298
04:13:54,229 --> 04:14:01,020
do it. They're just dying. They're just he's killing himself. I'm gonna hold the castle.

1299
04:14:02,840 --> 04:14:17,000
I'm gonna hold the castle. This is melee right? I'm gonna swing with the sword. That's technically

1300
04:14:17,000 --> 04:14:36,540
melee. Holy shit. I killed so many. It's not over. I'm gonna win. Okay we gotta deal with

1301
04:14:36,540 --> 04:14:45,739
the ball coming in the front door. We got just everybody body block the titan. This is gonna

1302
04:14:45,739 --> 04:14:51,110
be the problem here. They still have. Yeah they have so many strong units.

1303
04:14:51,989 --> 04:15:06,459
Deal with the immediate threat. It's the immediate threat right here. I get to go twice. Die.

1304
04:15:07,340 --> 04:15:21,930
I'm gonna have to go with the titan. We're gonna kill the naga queens. Ow. Um cure or

1305
04:15:21,930 --> 04:15:41,379
bless again. All right here comes the ball. It's just the titan. Go on. Come on. I think

1306
04:15:41,379 --> 04:16:21,500
I can do it. It's possible. Dispel that shit. Cure. Ah. It's still possible. It's still possible.

1307
04:16:21,500 --> 04:16:31,879
They have to get over here. It's possible. Bloodlust again. Do it. Kill them. Okay all

1308
04:16:31,879 --> 04:16:51,290
right. Here we go. I just need. I'm gonna lose. To kill. I have to get rid of the titans.

1309
04:16:52,520 --> 04:16:59,180
Bless. Again. Or should I stone. But stone skin is from melee. Haste.

1310
04:17:06,649 --> 04:17:13,290
Bless and then throw. Haste. Do you want to do haste and then walk over here and smash them.

1311
04:17:20,250 --> 04:17:26,219
No. Yes. Get rid of the shitty water surface. But I have to get rid of a titan.

1312
04:17:30,629 --> 04:17:35,110
They have two titans. Bless titan and then throw at this titan.

1313
04:17:36,379 --> 04:17:43,430
Bless titan and throw at this titan because he's got nine titans. I have six titans.

1314
04:17:46,180 --> 04:18:19,110
I didn't even fucking hurt him. Just start fucking roping. That was so close. That was close.

1315
04:18:19,909 --> 04:18:32,819
Come on. Give me a miracle here. Morale down. Come on. Give me a miracle. The titans resist

1316
04:18:32,819 --> 04:19:00,790
the spell. This sucks because the archers are gonna kill this. I actually think I need.

1317
04:19:01,909 --> 04:19:13,559
New plan. No. New plan. That's a bad plan. Doesn't matter. So I gotta get out. I'm

1318
04:19:13,559 --> 04:19:32,069
gonna get. I'm gonna fucking walk out and start swinging. I'm gonna go. I can't win.

1319
04:19:32,069 --> 04:19:41,739
It's not possible. It's impossible to win. This is the same unit. So I had three. No.

1320
04:19:41,739 --> 04:19:54,100
It's impossible. Just. I just wanna. He just took it without. It's empty. You're the beetle.

1321
04:19:54,819 --> 04:19:58,500
This is it. I got nothing. It's over. Game over. He has every single building.

1322
04:19:59,139 --> 04:20:31,239
He forgot about something. What? Wait, wait, wait. Back it up. Back up. Back up. What the

1323
04:20:31,239 --> 04:20:42,680
fuck was this? Where'd you. What? Who? How did this happen? Did he just. He just spent

1324
04:20:42,680 --> 04:20:49,399
every cent. How much? Five hundred and fifty. Eight two fifty. Where the fuck did you get these?

1325
04:20:49,959 --> 04:21:24,500
Final stand here. He has every base and every resource. Fucking stomach. Yeah,

1326
04:21:24,500 --> 04:21:32,420
he has every single base and every single resource. Why is this surprising to me? Don't

1327
04:21:32,420 --> 04:21:42,469
main one hero. I tried in the beginning. I tried to just make income. It's also something

1328
04:21:42,709 --> 04:21:47,510
I mean, I'm playing against eight people. You know, it's like it's a lot more chaotic and crazy.

1329
04:21:47,510 --> 04:21:57,319
It's hard to have more than one or two heroes. Just add 200 titans in and we're at 130 percent.

1330
04:21:57,319 --> 04:22:11,700
It's true. It's really like when you have an eight person map and the AI, the one AI that

1331
04:22:11,700 --> 04:22:17,450
forgets to move gets taken over immediately. And then whoever that AI is that took the

1332
04:22:17,450 --> 04:22:28,780
mobile wins the game. It's kind of what happens. All right. I can't really go anywhere.

1333
04:22:28,780 --> 04:22:39,129
So he's going to go like this. I'm going to step on the landmine. I'm doing teams this time.

1334
04:22:41,110 --> 04:22:58,139
I'm putting tan on my team. I'm doing two V2, V2, V2. Tan or purple? Who do you think?

1335
04:22:58,780 --> 04:23:09,819
We're going to shoot. Look, I'm just going to lead the other guy out and go take all

1336
04:23:09,819 --> 04:23:15,129
of his stuff. You want to green and purple? OK, that sounds good. We'll do it on a small

1337
04:23:15,129 --> 04:23:35,190
map too. Or small enough to go twice. Unfair. Hey, at least I guess I was going to say step

1338
04:23:35,190 --> 04:23:59,239
foot in the castle. I was about to hit the end. I was about to hit the fucking surrender

1339
04:23:59,239 --> 04:24:12,569
button. I can't go out like that. I made it to the last two. I'm OK with this. Everybody

1340
04:24:12,569 --> 04:24:49,350
else gets scooped up by tan's fucking insatiable conquering, whatever. Oh well.

1341
04:24:49,350 --> 04:24:59,559
Human players. Eight. Computer. Oh no, no, no. Seven. Other players. Let's do teams.

1342
04:25:00,280 --> 04:25:07,530
Water content. Road type. They don't matter. Monster strength. I mean, what does this mean?

1343
04:25:08,489 --> 04:25:20,760
Strong guardians. Water content. Normal. On what is this? Select single or two level map.

1344
04:25:21,399 --> 04:25:31,860
I'm not sure I want to do that. What does that mean? Underground. No, I don't think.

1345
04:25:31,860 --> 04:25:40,120
We're just gonna do extra large. No, we're just gonna do large. Two, four, six. Six players.

1346
04:25:41,079 --> 04:25:47,559
One, five. Not eight people. We're gonna do three v three. One v one v one. Three on each.

1347
04:25:47,559 --> 04:25:58,920
Two on each team. We're just gonna do a team of two versus team of two versus team of two.

1348
04:25:58,920 --> 04:26:07,159
Team two. Two v two v two v two. Two v two v two. I need to do this 130% difficulty. I have

1349
04:26:07,159 --> 04:26:20,360
to. Okay, so I'm gonna be green. Can I select green? Do I have to be? Wait, what? Random map.

1350
04:26:22,219 --> 04:26:37,110
Oh, team alignment. Okay, there we go. Team one is gonna be, who do I want? Tan or purple?

1351
04:26:37,670 --> 04:27:00,629
Who do you think? Purple. Team two. Blue and tan. Orange and green. I want to be green though.

1352
04:27:04,069 --> 04:27:17,540
Can I even pick that? Extra large. Okay. Normal, normal. Template.

1353
04:27:18,739 --> 04:27:34,950
I have no idea what the fuck this means. Do 100% this time? You think so? 100%?

1354
04:27:41,340 --> 04:27:49,559
I feel like with that, I feel like we're all right. I was doing okay. PvP options.

1355
04:27:50,860 --> 04:28:00,739
Coin flip. No, I don't want to. 100, that better be fine. We just, we just gotta get more

1356
04:28:00,739 --> 04:28:07,979
competent. You're not ready for 130%. Well, that's what we've been doing the whole, you

1357
04:28:07,979 --> 04:28:15,479
are in Australia. Extra large. Oh, large. Okay. All right. Now I want to, I want to set up,

1358
04:28:15,479 --> 04:28:24,569
I don't want to be red. Advanced options. How do I, I can't choose to be one of these other

1359
04:28:24,569 --> 04:28:49,850
players. I guess I just have to be red. Well, what do I want to do? Necropolis?

1360
04:29:04,360 --> 04:29:13,129
I've been killed twice in a row. Options. What else we got? Hill force. I don't know

1361
04:29:13,129 --> 04:29:19,530
what that even means. Advanced options. I want to, I want to, random map. I want to go back

1362
04:29:19,530 --> 04:29:30,409
to where I was just at. Large, one, five, team alignments, team one. So can I do that? Will

1363
04:29:30,409 --> 04:29:42,329
that work? Because I'll just be, I'll be green, right? No. Because usually there's a flag next

1364
04:29:42,329 --> 04:29:53,989
to every, everybody. I usually can just click it. No, it's because I have to, okay. So hold

1365
04:29:53,989 --> 04:30:05,879
on. So I have to, human or computer players. Okay. That's strange. All right. That's good.

1366
04:30:05,879 --> 04:30:12,340
That's good. That's good. Normal, normal, normal. Let's do advanced options. There we go. Okay.

1367
04:30:13,299 --> 04:30:28,780
Green and purple versus everybody else. Alignment. Yes, that's correct. All right.

1368
04:30:29,340 --> 04:30:37,799
Advanced options. Necropolis. What does it put in front of? Uh, too hot. Dungeon.

1369
04:30:41,989 --> 04:30:54,500
Stronghold. Fortress is what I just did. Conflux. Elemental. We'll do Necropolis.

1370
04:30:54,500 --> 04:31:24,309
Necropolis and what do I want my teammate to be? What was Ares before? There he is. All right.

1371
04:31:26,280 --> 04:31:40,139
I'm ready. Let's go. Teams of two. Everything should be good to go. Oh, I got to pick my

1372
04:31:40,139 --> 04:31:47,049
hero. Uh, don't even, I don't care what, what this is. This is what it's going to be.

1373
04:31:47,770 --> 04:32:08,739
Begin. Uh, that's fine. Creating map. There am I. There's my friend. Necropolis. All right.

1374
04:32:08,739 --> 04:32:24,579
Let's go. Let's get a second hero. Can I get a druid? First aid specialty or meteor shower.

1375
04:32:24,579 --> 04:32:39,030
Well, let's have you head out here and get the gold. Seer's hut.

1376
04:32:40,229 --> 04:32:44,219
Nowadays I have done this myself, but I need your help. A friend of mine recently had a

1377
04:32:44,219 --> 04:32:49,049
family heirloom stolen and wants to find it. The problem is that it looks exactly like

1378
04:32:49,049 --> 04:32:53,850
the pendant of free will. Please, please bring me any item that fits that description.

1379
04:32:54,809 --> 04:33:07,619
The artifact is not the family heirloom. I'll reward your efforts. Interesting. Money. Magic well.

1380
04:33:10,180 --> 04:33:22,819
Okay. Let me, let's go back. I want another hero. Let's get another necromancer. Let's,

1381
04:33:22,819 --> 04:33:31,400
uh, stack you up, send you up. Will the gremlins recruit lots of gremlins?

1382
04:33:32,919 --> 04:33:45,540
Let's actually get a save point here. Oh, it's a new game. All right. Master gremlins.

1383
04:33:46,340 --> 04:34:30,360
I think I already lost. Meteor shower. Get in there, skeletons. Come on.

1384
04:34:30,360 --> 04:34:57,259
Shit. I can't cast it again. I got this. Nice. 49 battle results. So now I should have

1385
04:34:57,259 --> 04:35:07,259
more skeletons. All right. 17 sulfur and then Griffin conservatory. I don't want to attack

1386
04:35:07,259 --> 04:35:10,619
the guards. No, I don't. I'm not going to do that right now. Let's get this level up.

1387
04:35:11,580 --> 04:35:28,459
It wasn't quite a level up. That's fine. Okay. Harpies. Let's go back here and spend some money.

1388
04:35:32,020 --> 04:35:35,860
Town hall. Or should I, I think I'm going to make a graveyard. I need,

1389
04:35:35,860 --> 04:35:47,560
I need enemies. I have to start getting people. Last time I did this, when I did town hall and

1390
04:35:47,560 --> 04:36:02,409
then I didn't, I need units. I'm going to go with the graveyard. Let's get some, oh no,

1391
04:36:02,970 --> 04:36:19,060
whites. Whites are, yeah, let's go. Let's go with whites and let's give those to you. All right.

1392
04:36:19,060 --> 04:36:25,799
What is my teammate going to do? All right. He's collecting. Let's get a second hero going out.

1393
04:36:25,799 --> 04:36:34,099
All right. Nice. What do you got for heroes here? This guy and this guy. Okay. Cool.

1394
04:36:37,659 --> 04:36:43,669
I am going to grab who has more. I'm going to actually give you the whites

1395
04:36:44,229 --> 04:36:54,840
and you're going to keep going. Let's grab what is this? A pack of mighty gorgons. Let's

1396
04:36:54,840 --> 04:37:03,209
actually grab this. Yeah. I need the wood. Gold, a horde of imps. I don't think I can

1397
04:37:03,209 --> 04:37:15,049
take a horde of imps right now, but I can collect this stuff. All right. Graveyard.

1398
04:37:17,479 --> 04:37:33,419
Get them made. Nice work. He's just picking up some resources. Very cool. I think I can

1399
04:37:33,419 --> 04:37:40,889
take these guys on. Horde of those little turtle enemies. What do you got? You got,

1400
04:37:40,889 --> 04:37:53,209
I think I could do it. They're pretty weak. Uh-huh. Wait, wait, wait. Before we do that,

1401
04:37:53,209 --> 04:38:07,930
grab this. Crypt. I want to search the graves with this guy. I'm terrified of what could happen

1402
04:38:07,930 --> 04:38:13,689
here. All right. Let's get the resources going. But you on the other hand, I have a decent

1403
04:38:13,689 --> 04:38:27,590
army. Let's kill him. Just in case of a fucking disaster. 25, 25. Plus I've got

1404
04:38:27,590 --> 04:38:41,590
fucking magic arrow too. Yeah, you get pretty weak. Float on over here. That's fine.

1405
04:38:42,549 --> 04:39:04,380
Aha. I get the advantage to attack you first. In fact, actually, yeah, dig it on here.

1406
04:39:15,770 --> 04:39:30,250
Dead. Resources. Experience. All the good stuff. I think that's all I can do. Estate.

1407
04:39:30,250 --> 04:39:51,560
Vampires. Bring them on. I am now going to do a town hall. Wrong building. Wrong building.

1408
04:39:53,659 --> 04:40:03,080
Thousand dollars a day. I've got some units here. Let's see. You. How do you, you got,

1409
04:40:03,080 --> 04:40:15,659
you don't have a bad selection here. You could probably kill these guys. I don't know if I could

1410
04:40:15,659 --> 04:40:27,270
take on the mighty Gorgons though. I'll go back and I'll give you. Oh, there's a bunch

1411
04:40:27,270 --> 04:40:35,139
of ton of random fucking people here. I want to give him the vampires. Make your way over

1412
04:40:35,139 --> 04:40:46,139
this way. I can take them. 13, 13. Magic arrow. I don't have any spells. It's all right.

1413
04:40:46,139 --> 04:40:56,540
Just get out there. Make a text to speech of my voice. No, I've never considered that

1414
04:40:56,540 --> 04:41:18,099
because anyone could get me to say literally anything they wanted. Natalia. Good. You're

1415
04:41:18,099 --> 04:41:34,250
watching the NBA finals. NBA finals? Who's the, who are the finals? Raptors and the Warriors.

1416
04:41:37,110 --> 04:41:53,959
Interesting. Raptors and Warriors. I don't really know much about either one. All right,

1417
04:41:53,959 --> 04:42:00,009
now the cover of darkness covers your city with a permanent shroud to all players.

1418
04:42:00,650 --> 04:42:08,200
If you get it to Christ Temple, maybe I get the Citadel. I'll probably get um,

1419
04:42:09,419 --> 04:42:14,389
blacksmith or marketplace. Start the Citadel up. Try to get through a city hall.

1420
04:42:15,189 --> 04:42:28,340
Or what does the mausoleum take? Mage skill level one. Okay, you. We're going to come

1421
04:42:28,340 --> 04:42:43,509
in here and take these. Okay, pretty good. Vampires. Me? Yes, you. How you doing over

1422
04:42:43,509 --> 04:42:53,220
here? Lots of pixies. Lots of walking dead. Lots of gremlins. Gremlins are weak though.

1423
04:42:54,409 --> 04:42:59,000
So random maps really are just all over the place, huh? I think I can.

1424
04:42:59,000 --> 04:43:03,860
Lots of walking dead. Can I take them? There's shit just everywhere.

1425
04:43:04,740 --> 04:43:13,830
They're just like spammed in every direction. Lots. I could probably take the walking dead.

1426
04:43:18,060 --> 04:43:33,029
Can't really move. Okay, let's go up. Lots of harpies. Board of imps. I think I can take

1427
04:43:33,029 --> 04:43:52,790
the imps. Let's go, uh, yeah, you up there. Vampire. How far are they? Can they do that?

1428
04:43:52,790 --> 04:44:13,060
Not that I'm ranged. Just let them come to me. Come to me. Four vampires. Let's see.

1429
04:44:13,860 --> 04:44:24,580
See how four vampires appear. Very well. Uh, I'm gonna wait with you. Oh, you're running

1430
04:44:24,580 --> 04:44:58,180
away? No, he's running down here. Well, okay. Very good. 240 exp and touch the obelisk.

1431
04:44:58,900 --> 04:45:13,500
Ooh, puzzles. I haven't leveled up for many of this though. I already did something today. Yeah,

1432
04:45:13,500 --> 04:45:25,430
I did. Imagine having feet. What do you mean? Everybody has feet. Now they're expanding out

1433
04:45:25,430 --> 04:45:56,580
here a little. Uh, let's take on the gremlins. Not strong enough. Good twice, bullshit. No more

1434
04:45:56,580 --> 04:46:25,909
spell power. Fuck. Make your way around. Zombies are so slow. Good damage. Keep shuffling

1435
04:46:25,909 --> 04:46:33,139
over there. So what, what, uh, what, uh, what is it? How much time is left in the, uh,

1436
04:46:34,259 --> 04:46:51,080
finals game? Gem Pond. Board of halflings. A minute and 30 seconds. That's not very long

1437
04:46:51,080 --> 04:46:58,099
at all. I need to get by the harpies. I think I'm, I think I'll do one week. Grab some, uh,

1438
04:46:58,099 --> 04:47:13,380
troops. I think so. Grab some more vampires and go kill the harpies. Yeah. Citadel. I want,

1439
04:47:14,180 --> 04:47:34,490
I get to upgrade. I need an amplifier so I can get better vampires and I can get more

1440
04:47:34,490 --> 04:47:44,150
skeletons. So that's good. All right. What are you gonna do, Purple? Just browsing around,

1441
04:47:44,150 --> 04:47:57,459
checking out his surroundings. All right. Level two, death knight. Advanced offense.

1442
04:47:58,180 --> 04:48:12,889
That's insane. 20% more damage. I kind of have to do that. We got lots of basilisks.

1443
04:48:12,889 --> 04:48:24,860
I can't do that. Lots of hobgoblins. Oh, that's just down there. Upgraded estate.

1444
04:48:25,819 --> 04:48:37,049
Vampire lords. What's the difference? No enemy retaliation. Undead. Five to eight,

1445
04:48:37,049 --> 04:48:47,049
30. Five to eight, 40. Drains life. Oh, they life leech. Okay. That's fucking awesome.

1446
04:48:47,930 --> 04:48:55,400
All right. So far so good. Uh, new week. Let's load him up, send him up north.

1447
04:48:56,119 --> 04:49:00,139
Oh, dwellings increase their population. Astrologists are playing week of the squirrel.

1448
04:49:08,220 --> 04:49:13,740
I'm going to give you the zombies and the skeletons. I'm going to leave the wraiths

1449
04:49:13,740 --> 04:49:19,659
because I want the other guy to have the wraiths. This is a pretty decent team.

1450
04:49:20,380 --> 04:49:33,029
Although what else can I build here? All right. Now marketplace or upgrade. So I do

1451
04:49:33,029 --> 04:49:41,479
wraiths. Grab the mausoleum. Mausoleum. Let's get some glitches. It'll be for the other

1452
04:49:41,479 --> 04:49:57,849
hero. We can take out these harpies now. A meteor shower. No reason to do this.

1453
04:49:58,490 --> 04:50:10,549
Just throw a magic arrow. And you can, how far can you go? What's your speed? Six versus nine.

1454
04:50:11,430 --> 04:50:20,490
So let's just chill for a minute back here. Chill again. You on the other hand, you move.

1455
04:50:27,349 --> 04:50:40,310
Boink. I need to go again. I'm just going to heal over and over again.

1456
04:50:40,950 --> 04:50:57,349
I forgot they could do that. Wow. That's awesome. These things are ridiculous.

1457
04:51:09,799 --> 04:51:23,080
Go. I mean, what can I do with this guy? Not much I can do.

1458
04:51:25,240 --> 04:51:35,319
Vampire will take it out anyways. Fly away. Whatever you do. Nice. Should level up from that.

1459
04:51:37,270 --> 04:51:46,020
Advanced necromancy or basic luck. 20% of the creatures killed to be brought back as

1460
04:51:46,020 --> 04:51:52,490
skeletons. That sounds pretty great. We're unlocked. What is this? Tree of knowledge.

1461
04:51:53,209 --> 04:52:02,630
Tears brim in the eyes of the tree. I need 10 gems. Well, come back when you can pay.

1462
04:52:04,299 --> 04:52:10,840
10 gems. Is it an empty castle? Is it a castle? Whose castle is this?

1463
04:52:11,560 --> 04:52:23,909
There's a fucking castle back there. All right. Um, I'm gonna, let me head back

1464
04:52:24,630 --> 04:52:32,939
because I want, I want the liches. I'm going for the castle.

1465
04:52:33,819 --> 04:52:53,220
Can I get that castle right now? There's not much in it. Let's just see what happens.

1466
04:52:53,220 --> 04:53:10,709
I'm not strong enough to do anything else. Can I get all three of them? Three liches.

1467
04:53:12,630 --> 04:53:16,630
I think if I come back and grab these three liches, I can take this castle without a

1468
04:53:16,630 --> 04:53:49,349
problem at all. I'm getting it. All right. So why? Pack of serpent flies. I mean,

1469
04:53:49,349 --> 04:53:56,700
I could, this should be easy. Pack of serpent flies. Just in case this goes horribly fucking

1470
04:53:56,700 --> 04:54:13,819
wrong. These things like suck. No, I wanted to cut, cast a damn spell. Get the first hit.

1471
04:54:14,939 --> 04:54:37,020
These things are really weak. Did I bite off more than I can chew here?

1472
04:54:38,729 --> 04:54:57,349
If I can attack, I may have bitten off more than I can chew. Maybe. Didn't you kill them?

1473
04:54:58,229 --> 04:55:17,290
Really? These little shits. Yeah, there's just too many of them. They just have like

1474
04:55:17,290 --> 04:55:34,340
spread out everywhere. I still might do it. Close. I still might do it.

1475
04:55:35,700 --> 04:55:52,099
No, I don't think so. There's too many of them. No, that's not, that's not gonna happen.

1476
04:55:52,900 --> 04:56:01,930
There's not, I'm sorry guys, that's not gonna happen. I was just curious. It's not gonna happen.

1477
04:56:03,049 --> 04:56:14,139
He's gotta do 10 push-ups now. Ow, god damn it. I gotta move this shit. I gotta get like a

1478
04:56:14,139 --> 04:56:33,369
different mic stand. I keep doing that. I keep banging my fucking hand. So let's go get that

1479
04:56:33,369 --> 04:56:41,930
castle. I'm gonna leave this for the other guy. I think I can get it with just this.

1480
04:56:42,810 --> 04:56:50,360
I don't want to be greedy. I could maybe attack the, no, let's get the castle.

1481
04:56:51,000 --> 04:57:09,639
Let's get the damn castle. Nobody fucking even in here. All right, you go restock. I can't really

1482
04:57:09,639 --> 04:57:19,240
do anything without money. Purple has gone into a portal. Let's see, I'm gonna pack a

1483
04:57:19,240 --> 04:57:29,020
Cyclops Kings. I have to start mass producing artifacts, but I gotta have one first copy.

1484
04:57:29,740 --> 04:57:36,599
I gotta bring you guys all this crap. This is nice. All right, this is,

1485
04:57:39,270 --> 04:57:53,099
blue is up here. Found the enemy. This is unclaimed. It is unclaimed for a very specific reason,

1486
04:57:53,900 --> 04:58:05,189
because you have to go through the pack of Cyclops Kings to take this castle. That is why

1487
04:58:05,189 --> 04:58:22,310
it is currently not available. You can take them. I don't know if I can take them. I don't

1488
04:58:22,310 --> 04:58:33,610
think that's gonna happen. Can I build anything else? Marketplace Skeleton Transformer

1489
04:58:35,979 --> 04:58:48,389
allows you to convert any creature into a skeleton. I need to get a marketplace in Blacksmith.

1490
04:58:55,419 --> 04:59:03,060
Actually, go rest in here. Just for a day. I don't know. You think it's worth, should I try it?

1491
04:59:03,060 --> 04:59:06,900
Blue's right there. I could fucking do this right now. If I have enough resources,

1492
04:59:06,900 --> 04:59:12,759
it might be possible. What you got in there? Oh, you got nothing in here.

1493
04:59:13,319 --> 04:59:22,340
I can take it right now for free. Go for the Cyclops Kingdom.

1494
04:59:22,979 --> 04:59:27,689
Try to get the pack of Cyclops, or go yoink at this city for free.

1495
04:59:39,849 --> 04:59:47,990
I don't know. That's so scary. The box that the Cyclops is guarding is OP. All right,

1496
04:59:47,990 --> 05:00:02,060
we're gonna split the timeline here. I'm dead. There's no way. That's not gonna happen.

1497
05:00:13,669 --> 05:00:21,509
I could just try to go forward, and I don't know. No. Five, four, three, two, one.

1498
05:00:22,470 --> 05:00:48,040
It's no use. I mean, if I had a little bit more, if I had a little bit more,

1499
05:00:48,759 --> 05:01:02,470
yeah, it's no use. If I had some more, I'm gonna go for Blue. Here's the thing. If I get Blue's

1500
05:01:02,470 --> 05:01:08,099
castle, then I can build up a little more, and send somebody else down to take that one.

1501
05:01:08,740 --> 05:01:20,900
All right, we're gonna go back to the timeline. Okay. Although there are lots of

1502
05:01:20,900 --> 05:01:24,979
gnolls, I could get this. I could do, okay, this is the magical garden. I could take the

1503
05:01:24,979 --> 05:01:39,110
gnolls. I'm gonna get it. Okay. Uh, Horde of Skeleton Warriors. I don't think I even need

1504
05:01:39,110 --> 05:01:49,689
to pursue them for any reason. How many gems did the tree want? Ten? I'll do it with the

1505
05:01:49,689 --> 05:01:53,500
other guy, because I have to bring this other guy up here anyways. I don't want to go to

1506
05:01:53,500 --> 05:02:00,919
South, because my buddy's got South covered. Purple's got South covered. You know, I'm

1507
05:02:00,919 --> 05:02:07,400
gonna, I'm going up North. Wait a minute, what's this? Hold on. Hold that thought for a

1508
05:02:07,400 --> 05:02:28,419
sec. I need Blacksmith. I'm at, yeah, allied with Purple. How many more days? I just feel

1509
05:02:28,419 --> 05:02:32,259
like this is not enough to do anything. Maybe like get rid of the gremlins and just,

1510
05:02:32,259 --> 05:02:40,060
can I just keep walking? Let's just see what's over here. I might be able to get these

1511
05:02:40,060 --> 05:02:53,259
pixies and the gremlins with this. Purple's going up. Where's Purple going? Tree? Let's

1512
05:02:53,259 --> 05:03:01,270
see. Plus one level. Ah, an adventurer. I'll be happy to teach you a little of what I

1513
05:03:01,349 --> 05:03:21,270
learned over the ages for ten gems. Just bury it around my roots. Or earth magic.

1514
05:03:21,270 --> 05:03:33,349
Advanced wisdom. Oh, earth magic. Earth magic's really good. Blue, how you doing? You still

1515
05:03:33,990 --> 05:03:42,889
got an empty castle. Yes, you do. Lots of pixies. I think I can handle it. I should

1516
05:03:42,889 --> 05:04:10,419
be able to. Yeah, they're weak as absolute fuck. They're terrible. There we go. Instantly

1517
05:04:10,419 --> 05:04:26,200
killed and almost. I'll have to lose the skeletons. Okay, cool. Lots of gremlins.

1518
05:04:26,919 --> 05:04:31,779
I'm not sure it's worth doing that right this second. What's over here? Monolith

1519
05:04:31,779 --> 05:05:02,680
one-way entrance. More pixies. Nah. Citadel. Wait for the city hall, I think. Yeah.

1520
05:05:02,680 --> 05:05:09,099
God damn it, he's back. Timeline. Because I went down to the tree. The timeline has

1521
05:05:09,099 --> 05:05:21,099
been split. That's why. Because of the tree. Because I went back into the tree. Should

1522
05:05:21,099 --> 05:05:34,099
have just went with the plan. Fifty dollars just came in. And a bunch of community subs

1523
05:05:34,099 --> 05:05:44,740
at the same time. Holy shit. Cyclops Parker just gave ten community subs and fifty dollars

1524
05:05:45,299 --> 05:05:51,700
at the same time. Holy shit. Thank you so much. We're with a huge amount of money.

1525
05:05:52,580 --> 05:05:55,459
And they say, German just wanted to thank you so much for playing this game again. It's

1526
05:05:55,459 --> 05:06:02,580
one of my all-time favorites. I can see why. It's great. It's really, really fun. It's

1527
05:06:02,580 --> 05:06:09,369
super interesting. It's challenging. You've got to manage stuff. The reason why I like

1528
05:06:09,369 --> 05:06:13,770
this game is there's a lot of resource management, but it's not overbearing.

1529
05:06:16,200 --> 05:06:19,560
It's just fun to collect stuff and look at scenarios and it's really, really fun.

1530
05:06:21,880 --> 05:06:31,639
I am going to keep going up. I feel like he's going to leave the castle.

1531
05:06:35,319 --> 05:06:45,610
And he's going to go this way. And go back. Because it's a new week here in a second.

1532
05:06:50,709 --> 05:06:56,169
I could have sniped the castle. I really could have. But I just didn't. I went back

1533
05:06:56,169 --> 05:07:05,700
down to see what the tree did. See, did he leave? Did not leave. Damn it. That

1534
05:07:05,700 --> 05:07:12,279
would have been so good, too. Kind of made the bed we have to sleep in, though.

1535
05:07:15,209 --> 05:07:34,729
What do I want to do here? I'll do Citadel. Oh, City Hall. We have a new week. Let me

1536
05:07:34,729 --> 05:07:43,939
take you back here. But thank you again so much to Cyclops Parker. It's a shitload of money.

1537
05:07:44,950 --> 05:07:55,139
Let's stock you up with people and send you back out. Unfortunately, the throng of trolls.

1538
05:07:55,139 --> 05:08:06,540
I'm on with two-way. I want this motherfucker to leave. Horde of pixies. Random maps really

1539
05:08:06,540 --> 05:08:10,540
are just so odd. It's kind of like somebody just threw up a bunch of stuff everywhere.

1540
05:08:10,540 --> 05:08:20,040
Alright, lots of hobgoblins. I'm going to be out here, though. I could probably do both of

1541
05:08:20,040 --> 05:08:23,639
these and get the experience. But he might come out and be annoyed by this.

1542
05:08:28,540 --> 05:08:39,770
Let's go this way. It's a lot, but I'm pretty sure I'll be fine. That's a pretty good

1543
05:08:39,770 --> 05:09:00,259
start. What's her speed? Five. Focus on you. Come on out. You really can't go very far,

1544
05:09:00,259 --> 05:09:21,529
can you? Damn it. Well, let's just eat you. They group up. That's good.

1545
05:09:22,250 --> 05:09:55,259
Losing a lot for a portal. I thought that was going to be enough. It is.

1546
05:10:01,959 --> 05:10:22,099
I'll get him back. Don't worry. These guys are strong, but they're just too slow.

1547
05:10:23,560 --> 05:10:27,479
Good amount of experience and a level up. Advanced earth magic or basic offense?

1548
05:10:36,790 --> 05:10:47,180
Probably advanced. Offense is good. 10% more damage, but I feel like I need that early.

1549
05:10:47,819 --> 05:10:53,139
I feel like this is good early. I need the damage.

1550
05:10:58,040 --> 05:11:01,779
Lots of zombies. Where the hell did I end up? This is two-way, right?

1551
05:11:03,880 --> 05:11:09,270
Five gems. I'm over on purple side. Quiet. What the hell is this?

1552
05:11:09,990 --> 05:11:25,270
It's red. This might be bad. Blue is out of the house. I'm surrounded by red.

1553
05:11:27,830 --> 05:11:34,900
Purple. I could use some reinforcements over here. Oh, boy. Wait a minute.

1554
05:11:35,959 --> 05:11:59,430
You don't. Oh, excuse me. You got one person. What about you?

1555
05:11:59,430 --> 05:12:05,319
Oh, several lots, several. I could wipe them both out. I think I got to what it takes.

1556
05:12:07,159 --> 05:12:41,689
Several lots, several. Back to base. Speaking of base. Ah, Citadel. Let's get some. I've got

1557
05:12:41,689 --> 05:12:44,650
to get some more units and I'm going to take him out and we're going to go north again.

1558
05:12:45,290 --> 05:12:52,520
Ain't nobody fucking in there. Okay, come on. We could really fuck red shit up right

1559
05:12:52,520 --> 05:13:11,029
now. Blue's coming down here. I might have to go on the defensive. Several, few, few,

1560
05:13:11,029 --> 05:13:18,299
lots, several. I might have to stick it around in here. Add to the forces.

1561
05:13:19,659 --> 05:13:33,450
I definitely need vampire lords and liches. I'm going to stick around in here for now.

1562
05:13:35,060 --> 05:13:38,419
But you, on the other hand, you. Dwarven treasury.

1563
05:13:40,419 --> 05:13:44,020
Dude, I want to attack the dwarven treasury and get like a bunch of money right now.

1564
05:13:44,020 --> 05:14:22,680
I think I'm gonna get the difficult one in the corner. You can take care of that.

1565
05:14:23,479 --> 05:14:26,860
I'm going up in this corner. No, I'm going to stay down here and protect

1566
05:14:27,819 --> 05:14:36,409
because this guy, I don't want to die. I can fly over here with him. I'm going to go

1567
05:14:36,409 --> 05:14:47,450
down. He's not going to be able to make it. They're so slow. You don't get to go twice.

1568
05:14:47,450 --> 05:15:32,790
God damn it. That sucks. Uh, I'll deal with you later. Really? Why are you guys so fucking

1569
05:15:32,869 --> 05:15:50,840
beefy? How much health do you have? I'm in trouble. I mean, I might, I might still do it.

1570
05:15:55,099 --> 05:16:12,630
Kill, kill this one. Yeah, I'll do it. I got 17 of these things. He's got the least amount,

1571
05:16:12,630 --> 05:16:23,000
but this guy down here. Keep this one occupied. You're going to lose, but I'll get the scalps

1572
05:16:23,000 --> 05:16:38,520
back. This might be worth it for the money. Dean, fly up here. Get away from those people.

1573
05:16:39,400 --> 05:17:03,529
Why do you get to go twice? I think it's good. It's going to be close, but I'm going to do it.

1574
05:17:04,569 --> 05:17:29,419
Oh man. Come on. Do it. Vampires are fucking insane. Especially the upgraded ones.

1575
05:17:30,380 --> 05:17:35,659
All right. That was a good fight. I got 1500 experience. I lost everything except the

1576
05:17:35,659 --> 05:17:42,060
vampires, but I leveled up. Basic intelligence or advanced wisdom, fourth level spells or

1577
05:17:42,939 --> 05:17:55,319
more spell points. Just have full stacks of vampires. Yeah, take the intelligence. 4000

1578
05:17:55,319 --> 05:18:03,049
golden three crystals. It was worth it because now I can protect the base. It was worth it.

1579
05:18:03,049 --> 05:18:18,259
It was. I had to do it. One way, one way. This, this sucks. Why does everything have to be

1580
05:18:18,259 --> 05:18:24,060
so weird and spread out? Now I can afford more, or I can afford a lot of this now.

1581
05:18:25,939 --> 05:18:31,110
Bang. I'm very protected at this point. If he comes down here,

1582
05:18:31,990 --> 05:18:39,560
I at least got to fortify the base. He's making his way down. What does he have?

1583
05:18:40,819 --> 05:18:58,709
Pretty similar. I need to get out of the base. Let me see. Who the fuck are you? Several

1584
05:18:58,709 --> 05:19:11,380
pack, pack several. You coming, you fucking, you wanna fuck around? Why is everybody coming

1585
05:19:11,380 --> 05:19:15,779
after me? What? I have like a whole other teammate. You got another castle up here?

1586
05:19:18,740 --> 05:19:26,470
I'm getting swarmed. I can't take on two defenses. I can, I can get rid of you right now.

1587
05:19:26,470 --> 05:19:46,250
On, save this. Original team timeline. Honestly, I should have just taken this base.

1588
05:19:47,049 --> 05:19:51,290
I should have, I shouldn't have went back down. That was a mistake. I could have just taken

1589
05:19:51,290 --> 05:20:05,430
blue. I, I'm, there are one, two, I'm being swarmed right now. Purple just like went this

1590
05:20:05,430 --> 05:20:21,380
way, uncontested and just took this. Okay. Well, I can either, I might just go kill this person

1591
05:20:21,380 --> 05:20:27,259
right now and then hope that I can get enough. Cause this is a lot coming in.

1592
05:20:28,380 --> 05:20:31,180
Hopefully you just go over here, but then you'll get the fucking castle.

1593
05:20:31,979 --> 05:20:43,909
Damn it. Well, we'll see what happens. Here we go. Okay. Now I am going to kill you

1594
05:20:44,470 --> 05:20:48,919
cause you're not coming up. Blue's not coming this way. I need to go back

1595
05:20:49,799 --> 05:21:08,200
through this portal. Port of imps. I have to fight these zombies to get through the portal again.

1596
05:21:08,840 --> 05:21:22,360
How did I get out? First of all, I'm going to delete you. Like I don't like you over here.

1597
05:21:22,360 --> 05:21:32,599
I don't like what you're doing. I'm killing her. Here are your ranged units.

1598
05:21:33,479 --> 05:21:46,139
Let's go with the eyeball. That's a better shot. I don't have a good angle on anybody.

1599
05:21:47,020 --> 05:21:58,220
I'll do it like I could do it here. Get the other ranged. Fly up this way.

1600
05:21:59,419 --> 05:22:10,380
The lich. That's fine. Just all focusing on him and he's going to die.

1601
05:22:12,020 --> 05:22:24,229
All right. Uh, I'm going straight into here. Or maybe I should get you stone skin to, uh,

1602
05:22:24,229 --> 05:22:49,939
you see if I can kill you. Cause you're ranged right here. Flying back. Gotta get you.

1603
05:22:49,939 --> 05:23:09,000
Let's go. You up here. I might actually lose. I mean, this motherfucker is just going to walk

1604
05:23:09,000 --> 05:23:20,139
around and just take all my resources. I had to do something. Get my rates in there.

1605
05:23:20,939 --> 05:23:44,919
Good. There we go. I have one skeleton. Hi. No, I got it. Open. It's going to happen.

1606
05:23:45,720 --> 05:24:09,939
Vampire is too strong. It's good. Good to go. You've been defeated. Advanced necromancy

1607
05:24:09,939 --> 05:24:26,020
or basic armor. So you've been vanquished. That's good. Five skeletons have been brought in.

1608
05:24:26,020 --> 05:24:32,439
I could have got this asshole to deal with though. He went up here. He's just hanging

1609
05:24:32,439 --> 05:24:39,610
out over here. He's going to go in the portal. I think. Oh shit. He's going to go in the

1610
05:24:39,610 --> 05:24:51,610
portal that I'm standing in front of. I'm screwed. Is it a different one? I hope so. All

1611
05:24:51,610 --> 05:24:57,049
right. I need 10,000. I think it's time to upgrade some of these. Let's get,

1612
05:24:57,849 --> 05:25:15,590
let's do this up. This is the wraith upgrade. Let's see what happens. Going in the portal. No,

1613
05:25:16,150 --> 05:25:25,020
deciding against it. Where's purple going? My buddy perp. The one issue that I have is I,

1614
05:25:25,020 --> 05:25:36,259
can I kill lots of zombies with just seven vampires? I'm not sure I can. I know I

1615
05:25:36,259 --> 05:26:26,009
can do this. Let me do this first. Everybody collapse on the goblins. Hello. Death. Hurray.

1616
05:26:26,009 --> 05:26:35,580
Nice job. Give me that. One way exit. One way entrance. Where the hell is all this stuff

1617
05:26:35,580 --> 05:26:43,419
going? They're everywhere. I feel like I'm in the arcane sanctuary. What the hell else is

1618
05:26:43,419 --> 05:26:53,880
even over here? Let's see if I can do it. I mean, they're pretty sloppy, but I don't

1619
05:26:53,880 --> 05:26:59,060
have enough to do any of this. We just have to fly over there and what's your speed? Four.

1620
05:27:00,419 --> 05:27:15,770
I should kill you very quickly. Three zombies perish. I don't think so.

1621
05:27:15,930 --> 05:27:27,909
Fifteen. No, I'm gonna lose. It's only maybe. Maybe. If I can keep healing, maybe.

1622
05:27:35,779 --> 05:27:46,180
I don't think I'm gonna do it. I can't heal. Yeah, I cannot steal life from dead things.

1623
05:27:47,770 --> 05:28:00,180
Yep. Well, this was a mistake. Can't heal from the undead. I didn't even know that.

1624
05:28:01,139 --> 05:28:10,330
I just didn't realize that. I know I said I wasn't gonna save scum anymore,

1625
05:28:12,729 --> 05:28:34,729
but I am. I'm kind of just fucking stuck back here. I'm stuck back here. I don't have enough to do

1626
05:28:34,729 --> 05:28:41,159
anything. Can I like make my way over to purple? Do I have any way to get back to purple?

1627
05:28:44,040 --> 05:28:49,939
I really don't think I can go anywhere. Let's see what happens if I go this way.

1628
05:28:50,740 --> 05:29:05,349
Is there a place to go down here maybe? Can I build anything? What day is it? Day five.

1629
05:29:08,229 --> 05:29:26,409
Hall of Darkness. Six thousand. I'll save it so we can get the growth. One way entrance.

1630
05:29:26,409 --> 05:29:30,970
Should I just go in this shit? I'm gonna end up somewhere. I'm gonna end up with like a wall.

1631
05:29:33,770 --> 05:29:50,490
I can't even move any further. Maybe it'll be this one. That's the hope, right? Red's coming

1632
05:29:50,490 --> 05:30:11,750
over to blue. Red and blue teammates. Let's go back. Power liches. I think I want to get that.

1633
05:30:12,389 --> 05:30:25,220
Do I need another castle? Do I need more money? Yeah. Well, let's see. Let's go next week.

1634
05:30:25,939 --> 05:30:42,040
Or almost next week. Cross your fingers. Three, two, one. Yes.

1635
05:30:43,740 --> 05:30:59,529
I'm fine. Hooray. Thank god. All right, here comes the growth. Before that happens though,

1636
05:30:59,529 --> 05:31:11,380
can I get a Hall of Darkness? I cannot, but I can upgrade the mausoleum so power liches

1637
05:31:11,380 --> 05:31:26,779
are available. 11, 15, 40. 11, 13, 30. Okay, cool. Let's go. Red has taken over that castle.

1638
05:31:27,340 --> 05:31:33,900
It's orange. I haven't seen orange the first time. There's orange right there.

1639
05:31:34,700 --> 05:31:51,880
Not very much. And it's empty. All right. Let's get power liches. Actually, no. Let's do

1640
05:31:51,880 --> 05:32:12,439
vampires first. I need to go down. No, you need to go back and get like minions. I have

1641
05:32:12,439 --> 05:32:17,700
seven fucking things. This other guy's coming up. You've got enough to do something.

1642
05:32:19,500 --> 05:32:29,189
Head down. I can start clearing this shit out and actually taking this stuff and then meeting

1643
05:32:29,189 --> 05:32:49,139
down with purple here. Let's just go here. No money. You come down here. So let's get these.

1644
05:32:56,090 --> 05:33:05,750
Lots of walking dead. Do not engage. That's all I can really do this week.

1645
05:33:07,080 --> 05:33:20,459
Don't. He's coming down. Shit. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. What's he coming down with?

1646
05:33:24,490 --> 05:33:42,470
Pack, few, few, several, lots. No, horrible. By the time he gets here, I'll have a force

1647
05:33:42,470 --> 05:33:49,509
and he won't be able to get it. I highly doubt that. I think I can get this one too.

1648
05:33:50,389 --> 05:33:59,240
Think about engaging. Why would I? It's just free stuff. Lord of Halflings. Let's see what

1649
05:33:59,240 --> 05:34:21,509
happens. Here he comes on his way. You're going to be throwing shit. So might as well just fly

1650
05:34:21,509 --> 05:34:29,099
over there. You're going to be throwing shit. Ares isn't helping. He's kind of just doing his

1651
05:34:29,099 --> 05:34:35,770
own thing down there. I'm not sure he's seen any action at all. I've had like two or three

1652
05:34:35,770 --> 05:34:55,240
encounters, which I started at the bottom. I started at the bottom where I got all the stuff

1653
05:34:55,240 --> 05:35:02,470
and nobody fought me. No, it's still all right. I'm not like in a great position, but

1654
05:35:03,270 --> 05:35:07,110
I mean, what am I going to do? What am I going to cry about it? What am I going to cry?

1655
05:35:11,689 --> 05:35:31,319
Lots of hobgoblins. Let's do these first. Six power liches. That's all I can do for now.

1656
05:35:31,319 --> 05:35:37,860
I can do some skeletons. I'm afraid of you. I don't think you're going to come over here

1657
05:35:37,860 --> 05:35:46,200
though. I could be wrong. I don't think that one has very much stuff though.

1658
05:35:48,549 --> 05:36:10,700
All right. Purple. You're fucking walking in circles. Yeah, this is not very much. That's

1659
05:36:10,700 --> 05:36:19,290
decent. I might take it. I might go for it. Pack a few, few lots of pixies though.

1660
05:36:20,090 --> 05:36:32,169
Let's do this down here first. Some wood down here. Hobgoblins.

1661
05:36:33,290 --> 05:36:42,459
Should be easy enough. Pixies of skeleton fuel. Yeah, that's true.

1662
05:37:02,090 --> 05:37:09,799
Wood. Campfire. 100 bucks. I'll take it. Pack of zealots. All right.

1663
05:37:10,599 --> 05:37:16,279
Pack, pack, few. I think it's time to attempt something here. I can get a couple more.

1664
05:37:17,080 --> 05:37:41,529
At least fill up a little bit. It's time to defend the home. The only dangerous thing here

1665
05:37:41,529 --> 05:37:50,380
is this. Meteor shower. I can hit up both, except that's ice. I should hit these two down

1666
05:37:50,380 --> 05:38:00,279
here. Air. Sprites. He is like made out of fire. I'm probably going to do it down here.

1667
05:38:02,729 --> 05:38:06,740
I can't hit him with any spells. I think I should just do it up here.

1668
05:38:10,759 --> 05:38:23,959
Might as well. That's fine. Do you have ranged? No, you don't. Anybody have ranged.

1669
05:38:26,169 --> 05:38:35,349
None of you have ranged. So let's hang back for a minute. That's your speed. Six.

1670
05:38:35,349 --> 05:38:55,259
Six. Get rid of you. This should be pretty clean. Should get first attack advantage on

1671
05:38:55,259 --> 05:39:02,729
everybody here. I wonder if I should go just focus on the fire elemental with the

1672
05:39:02,729 --> 05:39:13,819
air elemental. Fire elemental. No retaliation. That's good. Yeah, get rid of the elemental.

1673
05:39:24,650 --> 05:39:31,400
I really want to get rid of the skeletons, apparently. Well, whatever you do,

1674
05:39:31,479 --> 05:39:44,069
you're dead. Let's go with the 20 of the pixies.

1675
05:39:46,840 --> 05:40:03,990
Instantly kill it. You're now surrounded. Don't fucking retreat. I was trying to stop that

1676
05:40:03,990 --> 05:40:14,090
from happening. Retreated. Dick. I'm taking that castle. I'm going up right fucking now.

1677
05:40:26,650 --> 05:40:54,779
That castle is going to be mine in a second. Purple, come up. What do we got down here?

1678
05:40:55,419 --> 05:41:03,939
I don't care about that. Hoarder gremlins. I can handle the Hoarder gremlins.

1679
05:41:05,459 --> 05:41:25,580
This should be very easy. At least I hope so. Purple's gonna have a huge army.

1680
05:41:26,979 --> 05:41:30,099
Yeah, by the time this all is over with, I should have done that. Sorry.

1681
05:41:33,369 --> 05:41:36,650
I'm just being the wall right now. I'm just trying to protect everything and try to stop

1682
05:41:36,650 --> 05:41:41,689
them from encroaching while Purple gets five million people in his army. Okay, here we go.

1683
05:41:41,689 --> 05:41:56,139
Expert necromancy. I want that. And I want the bank. Can't move. Capital. I'm gonna wait.

1684
05:41:59,189 --> 05:42:12,169
Don't go in there! Blue's dead. Did Purple just take another castle that wasn't

1685
05:42:13,450 --> 05:42:31,590
a neutral castle? There ain't much in here, man. I think I can do it. I'm not as well

1686
05:42:31,590 --> 05:42:41,080
to take it. I think I'm gonna be just good. We found a naga bank. Do you wish to attack

1687
05:42:41,080 --> 05:42:51,580
the guards? 42, 8, 16, 10. Red has another guy right there. Yeah, Red does have another guy.

1688
05:42:56,060 --> 05:43:10,819
Ooh! New castle! I just have to go through the imps. Shit! Okay, things are looking up.

1689
05:43:11,380 --> 05:43:32,709
And I'm gonna get a capital. Tans down there. Come on, Purple, keep building. So this is just

1690
05:43:32,709 --> 05:43:44,250
a random castle. Can I- do I have enough to take it? I think I do. Do I though? It might

1691
05:43:44,250 --> 05:43:50,840
not be. I think I can get it. Let me just make sure- let me just put it in a safe point.

1692
05:43:53,610 --> 05:44:01,590
Oh, I thought it was a castle. What is it with this? I thought it was gonna have like a

1693
05:44:01,590 --> 05:44:22,330
to-lay siege. It doesn't have a fort. Okay. Well, all right, I'll do it. At least I have

1694
05:44:22,330 --> 05:44:42,790
another castle now. I got it. The castle is mine. Perfect. Now let me look up here.

1695
05:44:43,430 --> 05:45:20,790
You've left a little bit. This is still down here. He just came out. He was inside.

1696
05:45:21,509 --> 05:45:28,459
I'm never gonna get two birds with one stone here. I'm gonna hang out in there for now.

1697
05:45:29,419 --> 05:45:38,040
Is he just hanging out in there? Basic resistance or advanced intelligence?

1698
05:45:38,840 --> 05:46:05,740
I'm gonna say advanced intelligence. Build a fort. Five grand! How much are these worth?

1699
05:46:05,740 --> 05:46:11,319
I can take them all, right? I don't think I even want these things. Well, I mean,

1700
05:46:12,200 --> 05:46:19,979
I just got more people. I'm gonna claim some stuff.

1701
05:46:23,799 --> 05:46:32,380
Horde of royal griffons. Experience. Okay, this is the point when I decided this is worth

1702
05:46:32,380 --> 05:46:53,290
doing. I might be wrong. Just learned fireball. He doesn't even have a fort! He doesn't

1703
05:46:53,290 --> 05:47:08,360
have a fucking fort built! What? Why? I got this in the bag. I can take out the...

1704
05:47:13,159 --> 05:47:28,500
Yeah, I can probably melt almost all of them. Good. Right off the bat. Go down here. No,

1705
05:47:28,500 --> 05:47:42,729
let's go... Yeah, down here. That's fine. Skeletons. I'm gonna stay together. Who is

1706
05:47:42,729 --> 05:47:51,299
the threat? Nobody has ranged. I'm just gonna go after you, because you're the strongest.

1707
05:48:03,299 --> 05:48:21,000
Bullshit. Didn't you go three fucking times? Fireball? No. Stone skin. Shield.

1708
05:48:21,959 --> 05:48:25,299
Magic. It's just stone skin. This is technically melee, right?

1709
05:48:28,389 --> 05:48:39,340
All right, surround him. He's not gonna be able to do anything. I guess he is.

1710
05:48:40,540 --> 05:48:44,090
Sorry. I'm gonna get it. Focus on the one that we're focusing on.

1711
05:48:52,810 --> 05:49:05,209
Now you decide to come over here. I can't attack. Whatever. Just get him.

1712
05:49:06,090 --> 05:49:14,729
You really want to get these liches, huh? Should I just run?

1713
05:49:16,229 --> 05:49:20,979
Should I just fucking run away? No, I can kill him. He's not gonna retaliate.

1714
05:49:21,619 --> 05:49:37,750
This should be it. Castle's mine. 660s? What do you... Oh, it was Luna. I remember Luna.

1715
05:49:38,310 --> 05:49:45,990
Basic Scholar! Trading spells between spellbooks or advanced earth magic. Probably

1716
05:49:45,990 --> 05:50:00,740
advanced earth magic. Dude, that's... This is fucking two castles in 15 minutes. And I can

1717
05:50:00,740 --> 05:50:08,840
get some more creatures. How do you not have a fort? Interesting. All right, well...

1718
05:50:16,310 --> 05:50:22,360
Park here for a second. So I got one, two, three. I got three castles now. This one is

1719
05:50:22,360 --> 05:50:32,889
down here. All right, I got my buddy going down here. That's our end of our turn. Red's

1720
05:50:32,889 --> 05:50:40,709
probably pissed. Purple stills just stop piling. Massive amounts of money. Expert offense!

1721
05:50:41,430 --> 05:50:59,139
Oh, we're basic ballistics. I probably would do offense. I just want to be able

1722
05:50:59,139 --> 05:51:08,439
to do damage, man. Lots of familiars and horde of harpy hags. I got a pretty decent

1723
05:51:08,439 --> 05:51:25,860
army here. Let me go up here though. I need a city hall. Or I need a fort. Five grand? 2020?

1724
05:51:27,139 --> 05:51:41,900
I need another hero. Probably just from here. Look at all this. There's so much here.

1725
05:51:43,509 --> 05:51:54,060
There's my tavern. Death knight or witch? I mean, I have like three death knights.

1726
05:51:56,659 --> 05:52:09,509
I have the... am I supposed to do super necromancer? No, for a second I was like,

1727
05:52:09,509 --> 05:52:16,330
what's with the second photo that was taken? That person just lifted their arm up and you

1728
05:52:16,330 --> 05:52:26,389
took like three photos at the same time. Just like click click click. Okay, how we doing?

1729
05:52:27,450 --> 05:52:38,229
Purple, how we doing? Purple's got lots of shit down here. They still have that. Bastards.

1730
05:52:39,029 --> 05:52:52,779
It's time to come out. I'm coming out. Fort. I'm coming out. We're gonna get rid of these

1731
05:52:52,779 --> 05:53:03,479
pixies. And there's a bank right there. Orc chieftain. Let's go up. There's a learned land

1732
05:53:03,479 --> 05:53:11,900
mine that's good. What's this over here? All right, I think I can take these people on. But

1733
05:53:12,540 --> 05:53:21,509
I would just save them just in case something fucking horrible happens. Third level spell.

1734
05:53:22,229 --> 05:53:35,110
Murph. Lots of gnolls. Take them easily I think. Show Otto's feet.

1735
05:53:42,819 --> 05:53:52,330
Didn't we talk about this like already like a few weeks ago? Yeah, Kim like wrote that and

1736
05:53:52,330 --> 05:54:02,150
then it did the the fucking lid blew off. Ban that person. Well, it was my girlfriend.

1737
05:54:02,150 --> 05:54:34,250
So Kim's banned. That's who it was. Ban that person. And go. Holy shit. You guys,

1738
05:54:34,250 --> 05:54:43,220
I'm not strong. You guys are not strong at all. You're not strong to a point where I'm

1739
05:54:43,220 --> 05:54:50,139
embarrassed for even coming over here with the wolf riders. Jeremy, we're gonna get banned to

1740
05:54:50,139 --> 05:55:02,060
the couch. Prison. In a dazzling display of daring, you break into the local jail and

1741
05:55:02,060 --> 05:55:10,840
free the hero imprisoned here who in return pledges loyalty to your cause. What? Level five,

1742
05:55:10,840 --> 05:55:27,259
Malcolm. I got a new hero. Sick. Oh, that's so cool. And I'm at the end down here so

1743
05:55:27,259 --> 05:55:49,450
there's nothing else to claim. Court of Harpy. What's their speed? They can go pretty far.

1744
05:55:49,450 --> 05:56:04,650
I'm gonna just wait for them. I don't think you can go that far. They're all going down.

1745
05:56:04,650 --> 05:56:21,860
Why are you all going down? All of you are going that way? Uh oh. Every single one of

1746
05:56:21,860 --> 05:56:30,259
them is. I might, I might run backwards. I did not expect every single one of them to

1747
05:56:30,259 --> 05:56:36,470
come down here and get a fucking line. Uh. Shit. I'm gonna fly away with the uh.

1748
05:56:37,430 --> 05:56:51,770
I think I have to fly away. I don't have meteor on this character. This character doesn't

1749
05:56:51,770 --> 05:57:00,180
have it. I'm screwed. I mean I have 82 skeletons up here but every single one of them flew down

1750
05:57:00,180 --> 05:57:11,099
three. Like what the hell is this? This is bullshit. It's what it is. Um. I just sent

1751
05:57:11,099 --> 05:57:20,790
people. Whatever. What am I gonna do? Run? I mean I think I am. Am I stand and fight

1752
05:57:21,349 --> 05:57:25,270
or do I fly back here to the friends? I think I'm going back to the friends.

1753
05:57:25,909 --> 05:57:37,700
Yep. 82 skeletons coming in. Go. What is this dog shit? Why do they get it like every time?

1754
05:57:38,659 --> 05:58:13,430
Walls. Get him down here. Just wait till my big brother shows up. And oh why don't you go again?

1755
05:58:13,430 --> 05:58:18,889
Just go again. Why don't you just go again? I don't think I've seen that spell on my character in

1756
05:58:18,889 --> 05:58:33,580
like fucking a week. Well now I'm gonna head back this way. I just didn't expect this shit.

1757
05:58:33,580 --> 05:58:37,259
This is somewhat like kind of dumb fucking strategy that the computer decided to do right

1758
05:58:37,259 --> 05:59:07,509
now. How could I have ever expected that this was gonna happen? Get in here. This

1759
05:59:07,509 --> 05:59:22,709
necklace better be fucking worth it. All right we're in. I hate these things so much.

1760
05:59:23,669 --> 06:00:34,790
One of you die. Jesus. Tally it and kill it. This is so stupid. The idiocy involved in how

1761
06:00:34,790 --> 06:00:53,290
this played out. This is dumb. We're in the fucking corner. This is as far in the corner

1762
06:00:53,290 --> 06:01:06,090
with everybody. What the hell? I'm gonna hopefully I get a bunch of skeletons for this.

1763
06:01:17,639 --> 06:01:26,020
If I lose this, I don't even know man. I'm gonna fucking lose my mind if I don't win this.

1764
06:01:27,880 --> 06:01:45,909
No there's no way. I'm gonna win. Thanks for the artifact. Five percent more damage or what?

1765
06:01:46,470 --> 06:01:59,880
I mean that's better. Wisdom or spell? I need more spells. I don't have any.

1766
06:02:04,740 --> 06:02:10,099
What is it? I can't even look at it. Fucking hell. That fight sucked.

1767
06:02:10,819 --> 06:02:25,099
Tan's coming down. Necklace of Dragon Teeth. Please that would be worth something.

1768
06:02:26,380 --> 06:02:32,069
Warn about the neck. This item increases your knowledge and power skills by plus

1769
06:02:32,069 --> 06:02:37,270
three. That's actually really good. That's really good actually.

1770
06:02:37,990 --> 06:02:46,860
I'm not upset by that. I'm actually very happy about that. Now I don't have enough

1771
06:02:46,860 --> 06:02:54,020
to get this and I don't think he does either. A horde of... Do I really? I think I have to

1772
06:02:54,020 --> 06:02:57,939
come back at another time. Maybe I could combine them together and I could take this.

1773
06:02:58,659 --> 06:03:13,689
I could give him the centaurs and orcs. That's like 50 to 100 frogs. No I can't. It's not

1774
06:03:13,689 --> 06:03:27,799
gonna happen. Not with like this tiny little group. Let's plant this hero up here. Save

1775
06:03:27,799 --> 06:03:35,020
game. Yes I will. I wish it wasn't gonna be like this but it is. What is up here?

1776
06:03:36,060 --> 06:03:44,180
Earth elementals. Artifact. Spirit of oppression versus a horde of harpy. I don't

1777
06:03:44,180 --> 06:03:50,139
want to fight harpy hags again but I think I'm about to. Am I about to fight a horde of

1778
06:03:50,139 --> 06:04:11,319
harpy hags again for another? All right what can I do here? You're ready to come out.

1779
06:04:12,869 --> 06:04:22,220
What? In a second. Now you are. No you're not. I want you to get more. I'm gonna put the

1780
06:04:22,220 --> 06:05:08,500
dwarf in that building. I'm getting awfully closer. Can I... This is not gonna be good.

1781
06:05:09,459 --> 06:05:24,779
He's gonna take the castle probably. I'm fucked. Well just take this and whatever. He's...

1782
06:05:24,779 --> 06:05:33,880
I can get it right back. Like what am I gonna do? There's no fort. Yeah he's gonna have to

1783
06:05:33,880 --> 06:05:59,400
build a fucking fort. We'll just keep moving on. Little doggie. I think that's Midas. I don't

1784
06:05:59,400 --> 06:06:13,900
think that's Otto. Can I do anything else? Hold on let me be right back. Let's see if

1785
06:06:13,900 --> 06:08:19,740
something else is like going on. Hold on. Be right back. I have no idea. Midas was just

1786
06:08:19,819 --> 06:08:36,470
barking it. A ghost? I don't know. Maybe it was a skeleton. Hmm. All right do I want

1787
06:08:38,500 --> 06:08:57,340
you or you? Well I need to... Here. You go here. Okay. Just take this castle while I stare at you.

1788
06:08:57,340 --> 06:09:02,700
He doesn't really have that much either. That's the thing that sucks is he just he's

1789
06:09:02,700 --> 06:09:12,330
gonna just walk in and take it and then I'm gonna take it back. This is gonna be so dumb.

1790
06:09:12,330 --> 06:09:15,610
No he decided against it. He's coming down this way now. Good because now I'll just kill

1791
06:09:15,610 --> 06:09:21,290
him. All right purple I'm gonna need you to start swooping around the other side

1792
06:09:21,290 --> 06:09:31,720
to stop collecting resources and get over here. Several lots pack several. Who's dead?

1793
06:09:45,130 --> 06:09:51,880
26 18 8. I think that's enough. Purple doesn't give a shit about me. I know that's it that's

1794
06:09:51,880 --> 06:09:57,619
what like get over here. Kill something. Fight something. You just what are you doing with

1795
06:09:57,619 --> 06:10:04,250
this thing? Look at all this around you. You look at you look how many enemies you have.

1796
06:10:04,250 --> 06:10:15,349
Wait let me look at these heroes. All right really dude get over here. Orange is just in

1797
06:10:15,349 --> 06:10:24,090
your base. I'm going down there. I gotta find a way to get over there. You're right you've been

1798
06:10:24,090 --> 06:10:28,950
hiding over here too haven't you? See look I'm just they're attacking me and he's just

1799
06:10:28,950 --> 06:10:43,819
collecting fucking. This guy's just hiding back here. Pack lots lots several. God damn

1800
06:10:43,819 --> 06:10:58,580
it. I should just stay in the damn castle right? I mean I'm gonna upgrade the I'm gonna

1801
06:10:58,580 --> 06:11:10,759
upgrade this. Turn the skeletons into skeleton warriors. Can't do it yet. Well let's just

1802
06:11:10,759 --> 06:11:17,139
continue what I was doing here. You go in here. Park yourself that way. I don't have any money

1803
06:11:17,139 --> 06:11:31,580
to do anything. I would like for you to get back in here. Collected that thing. Yeah and

1804
06:11:31,580 --> 06:11:37,819
then maybe I'll go in that portal. Hang out in here for now. We're gonna be a turtle for a

1805
06:11:37,819 --> 06:11:47,000
minute just because of what's going on over here. Lord of swordsmen. Lots of walking dead.

1806
06:11:47,080 --> 06:11:49,720
I can't really do anything though. The dwarf will come out and take care of that

1807
06:11:50,520 --> 06:11:59,819
tomorrow. We're both just standing here. Purple are you just gonna let him do this?

1808
06:12:03,880 --> 06:12:18,200
He's picking strawberries. Well everything is taken from him. I don't think I can beat

1809
06:12:18,200 --> 06:12:33,049
the hellhounds. More vampires. That's all I can do at the moment. I need more like money

1810
06:12:33,049 --> 06:12:38,409
making castles. All right next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make some more citadels.

1811
06:12:39,290 --> 06:12:55,380
Or some more money. Like a town hall. Yeah okay I need a tavern. Tavern town hall down here.

1812
06:13:03,099 --> 06:13:08,950
Man am I gonna buy this game? Oh I hope you do. Purple what the fuck are you doing?

1813
06:13:11,020 --> 06:13:18,840
They brought the... Purple is gonna lose. I hope you do. It's really really good. It's

1814
06:13:18,840 --> 06:13:30,779
a really fun game. It's super fun. Super interesting. It's very very good. I might be

1815
06:13:30,779 --> 06:13:36,090
able to get this castle if I try. Am I using the HD mod? Yes I am. This is the original

1816
06:13:36,090 --> 06:13:52,419
one from good old games with the complete pack and the HD patch on top of it. I'm gonna

1817
06:13:52,419 --> 06:14:00,490
stick with the plan. I'm gonna buy the tavern and then so I could get to the town hall

1818
06:14:00,490 --> 06:14:09,189
to make money. I don't know what is left over here. I'm gonna fortify and I'm gonna

1819
06:14:09,189 --> 06:14:16,979
come up and kill this guy. Some more liches. Skeletal warriors. I can't.

1820
06:14:17,939 --> 06:14:38,250
I think I can kill him right now. I think so. He's not gonna come in the face. I know

1821
06:14:38,250 --> 06:14:46,009
that for a fact. Several lots. Several. Yeah he's dead. He doesn't have fucking anything.

1822
06:14:49,130 --> 06:14:55,619
Let's get rid of the ranged which is who does more damage? Six to eight and three five.

1823
06:14:56,659 --> 06:15:04,759
Let's cast this on you. Try to get rid of you first. I mean like let's go.

1824
06:15:13,209 --> 06:15:22,540
Here. Perfect spot. Thanks for going there. Just helped me out so bad. It is a very timeless

1825
06:15:22,540 --> 06:15:27,340
game. It is and even though I mean I'm not necessarily like that great at it.

1826
06:15:28,299 --> 06:15:33,020
It's just interesting. It's fun. I never really liked games like this. Games with tile based

1827
06:15:33,819 --> 06:15:42,939
movement and strategy management. It's not really my type of game but it just is fun.

1828
06:15:42,939 --> 06:15:47,979
It's something about it. You know the movement. It's that movement I really like.

1829
06:15:49,500 --> 06:15:58,939
Oh my god. Speaking of the movement. I tried to fucking. Hey making a good point for the game

1830
06:15:58,939 --> 06:16:21,619
here right now. It's all good. I think I can get in here and do this too. So there goes one.

1831
06:16:22,180 --> 06:16:30,020
It's tan. I'm just gonna save it again. I think I can handle this. No I can't. I don't

1832
06:16:30,020 --> 06:16:39,000
have any confidence. All right well that gets tan out of here. You need to keep going this way.

1833
06:16:40,520 --> 06:16:48,729
What's down here? Is that a peak? Lizard warriors? I can get this stuff. I just need a

1834
06:16:48,729 --> 06:16:56,819
pyro that can do it. You. Or you up here. One of you do it. One of you do something.

1835
06:16:56,819 --> 06:17:08,380
All right. Harpy hags. After I. You understand? Red just came through again.

1836
06:17:08,380 --> 06:17:42,740
I don't know what my teammate is doing. Horde. I wonder if it's enough. There's a fort here right?

1837
06:17:44,259 --> 06:17:57,110
Fuck. There's no fort. I don't have a fort. I might as well just walk out and fight him.

1838
06:17:57,110 --> 06:18:05,259
He might not even come after me though. And then I'm gonna make the stroll this way.

1839
06:18:06,520 --> 06:18:16,330
All right. From here I'm taking. I'm taking these guys out to the right. I'm going for it.

1840
06:18:16,409 --> 06:18:24,380
Let's gonna start the journey now. Or maybe I'm gonna. No I'll meet. Where's my other dude?

1841
06:18:26,310 --> 06:18:29,930
Yeah you. We're gonna trade here. Trade places. You head into the.

1842
06:18:31,259 --> 06:18:38,389
Into the castle. You're gonna help this way. I gotta at least stop moving around man.

1843
06:18:39,029 --> 06:18:46,360
All right. This is a decent force. What was I gonna. What was I gonna do here?

1844
06:18:46,360 --> 06:18:53,459
No it's down here. A town hall. Right. Town hall. Town hall. Town hall. Town hall. Town hall.

1845
06:18:53,459 --> 06:19:01,319
Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Town hall tomorrow. Who's this? Oh fuck. They caught me.

1846
06:19:05,590 --> 06:19:27,450
Um. I could just retreat. Yeah. It's not worth it. I'm out. It's not worth it.

1847
06:19:28,860 --> 06:19:31,900
That sucked so bad because he didn't have anything. He had like five units.

1848
06:19:32,540 --> 06:19:51,659
Keep going this way. I'm not going in there. Coward streamer. Tonight yes.

1849
06:20:02,470 --> 06:20:59,750
Phone's ringing now. Hold on a second. What is happening in this household? Okay hi. We're

1850
06:20:59,750 --> 06:21:07,819
under attack here. Okay you know when you like investigate. You're like what's happening outside?

1851
06:21:07,819 --> 06:21:20,090
You like open up. There's nothing there. Had to let somebody in. We're under attack.

1852
06:21:20,729 --> 06:21:26,599
Imagine like opening the door. You think like somebody's out there. Like oh like the dog's

1853
06:21:26,599 --> 06:21:32,150
barking. Let me like. We're under attack. You swing the door open. You scream that outside.

1854
06:21:32,150 --> 06:21:44,889
It's like a mailman. Hey here's your mail. Oh thanks. Thank you. So let's go. Let me

1855
06:21:44,889 --> 06:21:57,180
make it a big picture here. I need a big picture. No you open the door and it's a knight in armor

1856
06:21:57,180 --> 06:22:05,099
screaming we're under attack. Uh I would close the door. I'd close the door and I would just

1857
06:22:05,099 --> 06:22:09,340
get the phone as fast as I could and dial diamond money as fast as possible and be like

1858
06:22:09,340 --> 06:22:13,419
this somebody hit me out of their mind and I think they're going to fucking come after me.

1859
06:22:15,619 --> 06:22:23,060
You need to die. No no no no no. Do everything that you're supposed to do.

1860
06:22:24,569 --> 06:22:43,189
Town hall. Yes town hall gives me money. Oh shit you can't see. Now you can. That's what I wanted

1861
06:22:43,189 --> 06:22:50,919
to do. I don't have any more leftover money. I guess I could buy a little bit of stuff just

1862
06:22:50,919 --> 06:22:56,119
in case somebody decides to come to the castle. You're over here. All right I've got to stop

1863
06:22:56,119 --> 06:23:04,599
moving people around. You come out. Is there anybody around here? I don't think there is.

1864
06:23:04,599 --> 06:23:10,020
You're just gonna go into this fucking portal. Well should I leave him just to defend? You've

1865
06:23:10,020 --> 06:23:17,799
got a lot of people though. Maybe not. Maybe not. I got a scout. I have somebody guarding here. I

1866
06:23:17,799 --> 06:23:26,950
have nobody in this one but I have somebody about to be building up in here. Those fucking

1867
06:23:26,950 --> 06:23:49,099
harpies. Yeah go kill it. I think I can kill them right? I'm just scum. Put it again.

1868
06:23:49,900 --> 06:24:01,270
Part two. I like shouldn't have even done this but it is the other hero so that's good.

1869
06:24:02,069 --> 06:24:07,779
I'm gonna get slaughtered. I don't know. I'll be all right. I'm not. I ain't gonna move.

1870
06:24:08,419 --> 06:24:40,419
Bunch up again please. I hope you do. Bunch up down here. Oh please do it. Let's go right here.

1871
06:24:41,220 --> 06:25:03,349
Can German still run at 60 miles per hour? Yeah I think so. I ain't gonna go in. Actually

1872
06:25:03,349 --> 06:25:22,490
yeah I am. I'm going on this one. This is going for the uh the genie. Of course do it again.

1873
06:25:23,450 --> 06:25:45,619
By all means just go twice. Harpies. All right let's move in. One of these guys.

1874
06:25:47,959 --> 06:25:58,139
So there is an artifact behind. I wonder what it is. I will do a single target move on you.

1875
06:25:59,020 --> 06:26:04,220
I don't think it's necessary to do anything else. Like for instance we could do ice bolt

1876
06:26:04,220 --> 06:26:25,900
on you. No on you. Harpy's dead. It's gonna be decent experience and I'll get the artifact

1877
06:26:25,900 --> 06:26:39,049
behind. It should be good enough. At least I think it will. Save. Save. Save. 1200 experience.

1878
06:26:39,049 --> 06:26:46,979
1300. No level up but I get this stuff. Spirit of oppression. I can't get it yet but you know

1879
06:26:46,979 --> 06:27:03,240
what I mean. That was a plane taking off apparently. We're under attack. Guys like

1880
06:27:03,240 --> 06:27:19,880
flying around and take a fucking plane. Yeah it's a one seater plane. Why am I still

1881
06:27:19,880 --> 06:27:24,360
streaming? Have I lost my mind? What? It's only been like six and a half hours. It's not been

1882
06:27:24,360 --> 06:27:33,930
that long. This is it. After this. This is it. I gotta get a victory here. All right there you

1883
06:27:33,930 --> 06:27:42,459
are. We're good. Next day. I'm looking for a collapse from purple. Or can I like to steal

1884
06:27:42,459 --> 06:27:46,869
resources? Can I have resources? I can. Right we're on the same team. Can I like take money

1885
06:27:46,869 --> 06:28:15,509
from you? Wait why can... Am I using my money for this? Wait a minute. I can make heroes

1886
06:28:15,509 --> 06:28:28,819
and use them from odd. Okay well we have a lot of territory. 2000 seagulls saved and that's

1887
06:28:28,819 --> 06:28:39,259
when the command gets deleted. Command's gonna get deleted. Horde of sprites. Uh horde of gnolls.

1888
06:28:40,380 --> 06:28:50,630
Just head through here. School of magic. Plus one spell power. This is leading us down here

1889
06:28:51,189 --> 06:29:01,159
Is it Pandora's box down here? What is it? Spirit of oppression. This item negates all

1890
06:29:01,159 --> 06:29:10,790
morale bonuses during combat for both you and your opponent. That is not that good.

1891
06:29:11,349 --> 06:29:17,450
But I will take more of these air elementals. What about earth elementals? Lots of earth.

1892
06:29:17,450 --> 06:29:50,650
Maybe they'll join me. You think it's a scenario where they'll join? I'm not gonna. Come on.

1893
06:29:50,650 --> 06:30:01,369
That's imp cash though. That sounds good. What do we got down here? I have like a fort here,

1894
06:30:01,369 --> 06:30:08,459
right? Capital. Okay I need a capital. Do I not have a capital yet? How the fuck have I not

1895
06:30:08,459 --> 06:30:16,069
had a capital? City. I don't have a city hall here. All right I need to fuck the city hall.

1896
06:30:24,520 --> 06:30:40,729
Tan orange red? Who's left? Well that's all. You screwed down there.

1897
06:30:41,689 --> 06:30:54,659
This guy right here is so just I can kill him if I really wanted to. Let's do a ice bolt.

1898
06:30:56,500 --> 06:31:24,810
Kill him is weak. I will after I do this. Fly on over here.

1899
06:31:27,240 --> 06:31:41,419
Skeletons are just gonna be targets here. So he will kill him, they will kill them,

1900
06:31:41,419 --> 06:31:54,040
and this guy will just walk around with a broken foot. Not a big deal. Spell power

1901
06:31:54,200 --> 06:32:03,159
plus one. Advanced wisdom or basic scouting. I'm gonna say advanced wisdom which leads us to this

1902
06:32:03,159 --> 06:32:15,319
imp cash. We're gonna attack the imps. Perhaps. Let's see what's in there. I might not have enough

1903
06:32:15,319 --> 06:32:22,360
to do this. I'm kind of too spread out. It's too thin. I'll try it though. Yeah this is not

1904
06:32:23,080 --> 06:32:40,229
bad. Let's do ice bolt on you. Yeah they'll die in one hit or maybe two hits.

1905
06:32:44,279 --> 06:32:55,610
We'll make it. So there'll be money in here probably hopefully.

1906
06:32:56,979 --> 06:33:03,819
Games are always wins. Yeah they kind of are. These area elementals are pretty good.

1907
06:33:08,060 --> 06:33:24,119
This is a pretty good skeleton bait though. Like 160 something like that.

1908
06:33:24,119 --> 06:33:28,580
Gives me a pretty decent amount.

1909
06:33:40,939 --> 06:33:47,909
2008. Yeah. Hope you guys enjoy it. Hope you enjoy the seagull command there.

1910
06:33:48,790 --> 06:33:58,939
Because it's being deleted. It's being deleted. When you hit this, when you hit the year.

1911
06:34:00,680 --> 06:34:12,380
Two thousand bucks in four mercury. Pretty good. So I have explored that. I got the money.

1912
06:34:13,020 --> 06:34:23,900
Okay let's head back in here for now. Now I'm gonna take you down five gold.

1913
06:34:24,860 --> 06:34:28,950
Plus one spell power and uh what do I have for any people here?

1914
06:34:30,150 --> 06:34:40,340
Yep. Don't engage. Take the free spell. Whatever it is. Water walk. There's not

1915
06:34:40,340 --> 06:34:52,299
really any water here. What does it do? Walk across bodies of water. It's cool.

1916
06:34:53,430 --> 06:35:12,659
I'm glad I came all the way down here for that. All right. I got 8,000. City hall needs

1917
06:35:12,659 --> 06:35:23,259
level marketplace. Blacksmith. What else do I need here? Resource silo. One ore. I don't

1918
06:35:23,259 --> 06:35:27,819
really need it. Upgrade the graveyard. Darkness. All right. Black Knights.

1919
06:35:30,389 --> 06:35:43,349
Black Knights are now available here. Recruit some. 2012. We're almost at 2019.

1920
06:35:45,220 --> 06:35:58,180
And then it's gone. It's getting deleted. Here what does this have? City hall.

1921
06:35:59,139 --> 06:36:03,270
I need five thousand. For this to be a city hall I need a fort. I need to turn that into a

1922
06:36:03,270 --> 06:36:20,580
fort first. You're kind of coming in here and taking all my shit. Who's in here? Lots. Pack.

1923
06:36:20,580 --> 06:36:37,540
Lots. Several. This guy's dead. If he stays where he is. Someone's coming up here.

1924
06:36:38,099 --> 06:37:08,759
You're killable. Oh my god. Just get out of here and kill him. He's so weak. All right. I don't

1925
06:37:08,759 --> 06:37:12,439
want them to retreat so I need to get in a position where I can kill them both very quickly.

1926
06:37:13,319 --> 06:37:30,889
Don't retreat. Okay. So let me think about this. If I shoot this guy and he's dead and then

1927
06:37:31,049 --> 06:37:42,939
I... I'm gonna say like magic arrow should kill him or magic arrow on them. Health five. Health

1928
06:37:42,939 --> 06:38:04,099
ten. I'm gonna be just be sure. I'm gonna do ice bolt. Got it. What'd you have? Artifact. Magic.

1929
06:38:13,479 --> 06:38:18,119
That was... Tan was coming to try to take the castle because he didn't have anything.

1930
06:38:19,080 --> 06:38:23,000
Tan was essentially the guy out in the desert crawling in the sand.

1931
06:38:24,840 --> 06:38:36,580
Please. Water. Water. And I just fucking threw a dart at him. And he had magic missile on him.

1932
06:38:36,580 --> 06:38:47,750
Great. Well, I don't really know who's left. Purple has kind of gone up here and around.

1933
06:38:47,750 --> 06:39:01,700
It's red and orange. I think I can wipe you out here too. I think I can. Nobody in here.

1934
06:39:02,970 --> 06:39:09,990
Look at all. I got so much money. I gotta get some people in here because if he comes over,

1935
06:39:10,790 --> 06:39:27,319
let's collapse on him. But like, fuck you. You're not taking all this stuff. This is all mine.

1936
06:39:28,520 --> 06:39:53,610
There he goes. He's not going in the castle. Hurry. Hurry. I don't need to hurry. You got

1937
06:39:53,610 --> 06:40:05,689
20-20. Oh well. Whatever. He ain't going in there. He'll die. He's got dog shit defense.

1938
06:40:05,689 --> 06:40:17,159
There's a fort here, right? Yes. I think we're getting close to winning the game.

1939
06:40:18,040 --> 06:40:29,029
I did a lot of work this time. A lot. I was making sure I was stopping people. I was

1940
06:40:29,029 --> 06:40:35,419
conquering. I was attacking. Purple was just getting resources and running around in circles.

1941
06:40:35,419 --> 06:40:40,500
I did a lot of work this time to a point where I'm very proud of what I've been able to

1942
06:40:40,500 --> 06:41:18,340
accomplish here. Okay. Let's go and kill this guy. How many heads need to roll here? Can I

1943
06:41:18,340 --> 06:41:26,330
do it? I'm gonna be blocking the path, right? And he can't go anywhere. Get him dead. Get

1944
06:41:26,330 --> 06:41:40,810
him. Oh, I'm gone. Forget about these artifacts. I need to get up here and continue to win the

1945
06:41:40,810 --> 06:41:53,560
game. Next day. Clean this guy out. Orange still has a bunch of shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1946
06:41:53,560 --> 06:42:01,700
Orange is right up my front door. Where is this orange? Is Purple being destroyed?

1947
06:42:08,229 --> 06:42:27,740
How did you get here? What is he doing? Yeah, it's red and orange versus me and

1948
06:42:27,740 --> 06:42:35,299
Purple. That's who left. That's it. And he's just not doing anything. This is a decent force.

1949
06:42:35,299 --> 06:42:40,180
Like, what are you doing up in the snow? You need to get down here. I'm getting

1950
06:42:41,220 --> 06:42:45,779
swarmed by both of them at the same time. I can't kill them both. I can't do this both.

1951
06:42:46,419 --> 06:43:04,869
I'm gonna die here. Well, we're gonna fireball. Can I get the other one? No.

1952
06:43:04,869 --> 06:43:25,689
I did a lot of work this game. Even when you're on your own,

1953
06:43:25,689 --> 06:43:41,130
Ares still fucks you. We're supposed to be on the same damn team. That's definitely what he did

1954
06:43:41,130 --> 06:43:53,319
the other game, too. He's just avoiding all conflict somehow. I don't want a retreat

1955
06:43:53,319 --> 06:44:03,529
scenario, so let me see here. Can I kill them all quickly here? He's gonna retreat. Not

1956
06:44:03,529 --> 06:44:14,759
gonna be enough. Here he goes. No, he's not leaving. Let me kill you. Come on. I still

1957
06:44:14,759 --> 06:44:45,529
have plenty of people to do turns. Come on. I'm gonna lose this fucking castle up here.

1958
06:44:46,650 --> 06:45:00,970
He's gonna take it for free. Purple's just scratching his ass. No, I can't go down there

1959
06:45:00,970 --> 06:45:05,500
and take that. I can't. How do I get down? I gotta get down there somehow.

1960
06:45:06,220 --> 06:45:12,330
It's through one of these portals, I think, or through here. I didn't, like,

1961
06:45:12,330 --> 06:45:15,689
do anything down here. I didn't have enough money. I think this is another loss.

1962
06:45:16,650 --> 06:45:29,909
Did Orange take the Psyquops castle? No, he's about to. Just head in here. I gotta refill some

1963
06:45:29,909 --> 06:45:47,020
people. Hang out in there for a day. He's gonna take it. Where's Purple? There he is. He took

1964
06:45:47,020 --> 06:45:55,930
it. He just killed Purple. Purple just died. One of his guys just died. He's got nothing.

1965
06:45:55,930 --> 06:46:05,939
Purple is now worthless. Dude, like, can I just, like, come take these? I can't even.

1966
06:46:05,939 --> 06:46:17,529
Can you deliver them to me? Just deliver them to me, please. So I have a chance here. I could

1967
06:46:17,529 --> 06:46:21,779
probably get... What do you have for enemies? All right, here's what we're gonna do. You ready

1968
06:46:21,779 --> 06:46:37,240
for this? We're gonna do a little consolidation here. Who has the best... Who's the higher level?

1969
06:46:39,319 --> 06:46:47,990
Level nine versus level one. Yeah, just give everybody to him. Pull out some more skeleton

1970
06:46:47,990 --> 06:46:54,180
warriors and let's just go kill him. Let's try to kill him. Take the castle back.

1971
06:46:56,709 --> 06:47:19,610
He's right up here. I will win this fight. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good idea. The

1972
06:47:19,610 --> 06:47:27,939
butterflies are not worth having. Let's see. Is Purple about to be deleted? And then I have

1973
06:47:27,939 --> 06:47:38,200
to fight versus... Is it gonna be 2v1? That's Ares right there. Where'd he go? Where's Ares?

1974
06:47:38,200 --> 06:48:22,520
I just saw him. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? No, that's Gem. And I'm gonna upgrade the

1975
06:48:22,520 --> 06:48:58,139
butchers. Just right here. Upgrade graveyard. There we go. All right, this is the force to take

1976
06:48:58,779 --> 06:49:03,419
the stuff back and keep everything. Hoard, hoard. He's going for this castle. He's gonna...

1977
06:49:03,419 --> 06:49:16,150
Let him do it. Let him go die. He actually did it. Okay, so that's weak because those were

1978
06:49:17,110 --> 06:49:24,759
like 10 or 15 cyclopses. Yeah, I'm gonna take the box. Give me the box. Give me the box.

1979
06:49:25,639 --> 06:49:39,220
Give me the box. Several lots. Give me the box. Open the box. Oh, that's 10,000 experience.

1980
06:49:40,020 --> 06:49:56,330
He didn't even care. All right. Expert earth magic. Expert wisdom. Expert necromancy.

1981
06:50:01,349 --> 06:50:07,799
Anti-magic. Should I take it? Lots, lots. Hoard packs several. I think I can do it.

1982
06:50:08,360 --> 06:50:27,509
I don't think this has a... I did it. I'm gonna get it. Anti-magic. Protects the select

1983
06:50:27,509 --> 06:50:35,130
unit from all spells. Now let's meteor shower right here. That'll hit the... It'll be good

1984
06:50:35,130 --> 06:50:42,580
down... Yeah, right here. It'll hit the three of it. Should kill that. Almost. Close enough.

1985
06:50:43,459 --> 06:50:56,549
All right, get fucking pumped up, boys and girls. Let's go. Target number one. Top and

1986
06:50:56,549 --> 06:51:27,430
bottom. I'm on it. Roger that. This is priority now. Wow, that did a lot of damage.

1987
06:51:27,430 --> 06:51:44,840
Wow! I'm so... I'm way too excited for this. You got a cool walking sound.

1988
06:51:50,139 --> 06:51:55,700
Really? You guys can handle that. I'm gonna say... Let's get up here.

1989
06:51:58,069 --> 06:52:03,720
No. They're in the back line. Get rid of this and heal that up.

1990
06:52:04,599 --> 06:52:14,549
Skeletons, that's fine. You don't stand a chance. All right. I am gonna fly up here.

1991
06:52:14,549 --> 06:52:31,669
I'm gonna take out the... I'm gonna try at least to get rid of this. Not bad. These

1992
06:52:32,470 --> 06:52:40,299
glitches do so much damage to the air. I own so much property over here it's kind of ridiculous.

1993
06:52:41,500 --> 06:53:07,459
Do some ice bolt just for fun. Let's go. Heroes of might and monopoly.

1994
06:53:08,340 --> 06:53:17,750
He hasn't retreated yet. He can't retreat. He's in the castle. Where are you gonna

1995
06:53:17,750 --> 06:53:46,409
retreat to? Now I just scared the shit out of myself. Can he run away? He didn't have anything.

1996
06:53:46,409 --> 06:53:57,669
Advanced offense or basic tactics? Um... offense. I got it. I got the thing and I took over the

1997
06:53:57,669 --> 06:54:02,150
castle. But it doesn't really matter if I've get... You need to pull some weight here.

1998
06:54:04,919 --> 06:54:12,459
Honest to god. You gotta start to pull weight. You're starting to get a little sloppy.

1999
06:54:16,729 --> 06:54:35,080
Need a marketplace. I can't do everything purple. Okay, he actually took that.

2000
06:54:36,500 --> 06:54:42,150
Come on. Good. This doesn't have anything. Look at how fucking shitty this is.

2001
06:54:48,099 --> 06:54:58,500
I need a town hall. I need a tavern. Well, might as well just get in. No, I don't even need to.

2002
06:55:01,450 --> 06:55:12,919
All right. Next, we're gonna do a mage guild and then I'm gonna make this a town. What

2003
06:55:12,919 --> 06:55:17,639
about over here? Power liches. Lots of power liches. These artifacts over here though.

2004
06:55:18,439 --> 06:55:36,950
I'm gonna claim some of this stuff because I don't want you to have it. Purple coming in.

2005
06:55:38,389 --> 06:55:40,709
Let's get this stuff back in our name.

2006
06:55:46,090 --> 06:55:55,990
Artifact. Amulet of the Undertaker. Lots of power liches. Build that. City hall.

2007
06:55:57,770 --> 06:56:17,990
More income. More income. More income. Well, I think I can definitely take them. I think

2008
06:56:17,990 --> 06:56:24,169
lots of liches. You're right here. You're not that strong though.

2009
06:56:33,099 --> 06:56:37,939
You're not gonna be able to get it with what you have here. I highly doubt that.

2010
06:56:41,740 --> 06:56:45,580
No, he doesn't have enough to attack. He has like, he doesn't have any people.

2011
06:56:45,580 --> 06:56:50,419
I could kill him with just like four black knights. All right, I'm gonna go for it.

2012
06:56:51,060 --> 06:57:03,639
I'm gonna go in. Power liches. 22. That's a lot, but hopefully the artifact's worth it.

2013
06:57:04,279 --> 06:57:16,619
What are they immune to? What do they hypnotize? Won't affect anybody.

2014
06:57:16,700 --> 06:57:39,430
Fireball. Meteor. Fireball is 75. I think it's still Meteor. Forgetfulness. Half of the selected

2015
06:57:39,430 --> 06:57:44,950
enemy unit forgets to use their ranged attack. You can't do it. I'm just going for damage.

2016
06:57:48,470 --> 06:58:09,290
This is ranged, so we're just gonna get in. Blind makes him unable to move. This is already

2017
06:58:09,290 --> 06:58:14,490
not off to a great start, but I hope that artifact is worth getting. Good. Let's go with

2018
06:58:35,830 --> 06:58:41,139
another. Let's go to Fireball. Meteor. I'm gonna go back in the house anyways.

2019
06:58:41,779 --> 06:58:59,880
Just do a bunch of damage. I'm gonna lose a lot, but it's okay. We're almost actually at the end

2020
06:58:59,880 --> 06:59:16,180
game, I think, here. What is it? Amulet of the Undertaker and the Golden Bow. All right. What

2021
06:59:16,180 --> 06:59:21,450
about the neck? This amulet increases your necromancy skill by five percent. And then the

2022
06:59:22,409 --> 06:59:29,430
That's not that great. That's all right, I guess. He's not going to attack.

2023
06:59:30,150 --> 06:59:35,479
They're just so all over the place. I'm gonna lose because Purple's not fucking doing anything.

2024
06:59:36,599 --> 06:59:42,180
Purple, they're all over here. What are you still doing up there, Purple?

2025
06:59:43,540 --> 07:00:07,590
Just get over here. That's actually incredible. That's fantastic, actually.

2026
07:00:08,310 --> 07:00:24,150
Let's get back in here. All right. Did I do this? This is done. Capital. Cannot build a capital yet.

2027
07:00:24,150 --> 07:00:39,590
I have... I need a capital. What should I make the capital? Probably this. Yeah.

2028
07:00:46,090 --> 07:00:50,790
Ten thousand gold? That's the capital. I need a mage tower.

2029
07:01:02,950 --> 07:01:18,020
Don't come over here. Soon 20 bone dragons. It's possible. Purple has entered the server.

2030
07:01:19,580 --> 07:01:30,060
Here he is. Oh, great. You have five dwarves, nine riders, and 47, like, dirty, like,

2031
07:01:30,860 --> 07:01:43,590
peasant people with pitchforks. Does anybody... You have to have a hero that has something,

2032
07:01:43,590 --> 07:01:49,529
right? That's who you send all the way over here. He's probably coming over to look for

2033
07:01:49,529 --> 07:01:56,970
food. Hey, we're on the same team. Could I like bum a couple of cigarettes off you?

2034
07:01:58,250 --> 07:02:12,040
Oh, get out of here. Okay, see you later, man. This sucks. I'm just gonna bring him down here.

2035
07:02:12,840 --> 07:02:24,180
It's almost like I should build this up. Cliff nest, I guess. I'm gonna just build...

2036
07:02:24,180 --> 07:02:29,580
Let's build some of this. I can do the citadel, the capital up here in a minute.

2037
07:02:32,900 --> 07:02:36,340
Imagine blaming your team in a single player game. Well, they haven't... He hasn't done

2038
07:02:36,340 --> 07:02:43,639
anything. He's just died. He's supposed to be really good. Oh, you took a castle.

2039
07:02:44,360 --> 07:02:56,439
Good job. Take that one too. Which castles did you take? That's default enemies. Why is it...

2040
07:03:05,159 --> 07:03:14,889
He's still got, like, default enemies. When I'm playing against him, he's impossible to overcome.

2041
07:03:14,889 --> 07:03:23,450
When I play with him, he's still using default fucking vampires. I mean, I'm just so fucking

2042
07:03:23,450 --> 07:03:30,259
upset about this. I'm so upset about these things. Well, it's time just to stockpile.

2043
07:03:30,900 --> 07:03:53,349
Upgrade you guys. Not bad. I was supposed to turn this into a

2044
07:03:53,909 --> 07:04:10,279
capital. See you next week. Good job. You did great. I'm very proud of you. You just...

2045
07:04:10,279 --> 07:04:14,740
Nice work. I can't wait to get the inevitable purple has been deleted from the server.

2046
07:04:15,459 --> 07:04:29,959
Gremlin population's double. It's all over the place now? Okay. 4500. I need to start

2047
07:04:29,959 --> 07:04:36,790
making other stuff too, though. I need, like, a hall of darkness. I need a capital building!

2048
07:04:37,669 --> 07:04:50,490
I'm going in here. When was the last time I saved the game? Oh my god, what am I doing?

2049
07:04:51,209 --> 07:05:02,790
I'm so upset. I did not... I, for some reason, I don't... I didn't... What the fuck did I do

2050
07:05:02,790 --> 07:05:10,470
that for? It's okay. I can still do this. Health. They don't have very much health.

2051
07:05:14,259 --> 07:05:27,720
I am going to bloodlust. I don't have bloodlust. Hypnotize. That's not going to affect anybody?

2052
07:05:32,860 --> 07:05:45,830
Holy shit. Hayden Clipfell just gave $115. Thank you so much for the 115 bucks. That's a

2053
07:05:45,830 --> 07:05:57,270
ton of fucking money. Uh, they say hello, good night. Thank you. That's an insane amount

2054
07:05:57,270 --> 07:06:17,610
of money. Thank you so much. Thank you for the fucking 115. It's not as scary as I thought

2055
07:06:17,610 --> 07:06:25,659
it was going to be. Let's collapse on the... Go forward. Yeah, this is not bad. This is going

2056
07:06:25,659 --> 07:06:30,540
to be fine. I was scared for a second. I don't know why. I just... I keep thinking

2057
07:06:30,540 --> 07:06:35,580
they're like dragons, but they're not. Uh, let's go up here.

2058
07:06:41,639 --> 07:06:50,060
Just griffins. These two can handle it.

2059
07:06:50,060 --> 07:07:10,540
15, 13. There. And this is probably going to be it. I probably build a, uh,

2060
07:07:12,060 --> 07:07:28,599
have a griffins now, right? That's a good amount of experience. Expert offense of basic fire.

2061
07:07:29,560 --> 07:07:39,130
I think expert offense. Having defeated the royal griffins, you just got three angels.

2062
07:07:41,779 --> 07:07:54,900
Oh damn. I think I'm... Give up the basic skeletons. I wish I could just... The whites

2063
07:07:55,619 --> 07:08:30,599
with the zombies. Two to three, 20 health. Three to five. Yeah. Two to three, 20, five, five.

2064
07:08:31,819 --> 07:08:45,349
Yeah, the zombies are worse. Can they just stay there? That's a big waste. Uh, but that... I

2065
07:08:45,349 --> 07:08:54,889
mean, this is a really big, powerful enemy. 200 health. Three of them. I can get the zombies

2066
07:08:54,889 --> 07:09:15,830
back. You see, I can get them back. Citadel. Don't do that. Angels are worth like 9k,

2067
07:09:15,830 --> 07:09:22,279
42 zombies are worth like five and a half k. Yeah. Angels are a little out of place for this army.

2068
07:09:22,279 --> 07:09:28,939
They'll be fine. And have you ever heard of like a shadow priest? We're gonna be just fine.

2069
07:09:28,939 --> 07:09:53,000
We're gonna win. Can do the market. Market. I need a capital. Give me... Let me get the

2070
07:09:53,000 --> 07:10:13,099
capital first. It's just me against the world. Let me get a good look at your army. It's not

2071
07:10:13,099 --> 07:10:48,419
that great. Armies really not that good. 8,500. Starting to lose the long game here. Just don't

2072
07:10:48,419 --> 07:10:56,740
have enough money. Low morale ogres. I need to get out of the castle and just fucking...

2073
07:10:57,860 --> 07:11:14,869
I need to start claiming shit back. This is my stuff. Capital. I'll get a note.

2074
07:11:14,869 --> 07:11:43,779
Make this the capital and then I'm good to go. I got... No, I'm gonna stack. This is the guy

2075
07:11:43,779 --> 07:11:52,090
that's gonna win. This is my mobile destructive unit. Oh, fuck. He's going for the other

2076
07:11:52,090 --> 07:12:00,069
castle. Hey, you could blame this on me. But then I would blame this on Purple. And then

2077
07:12:00,069 --> 07:12:31,860
Purple would blame it on nothing because he's not a person. He's not alive. Almost done.

2078
07:12:32,500 --> 07:12:43,930
What do we got? Anybody near me? You're down here. I can defend this. This is gonna get this.

2079
07:12:43,930 --> 07:13:07,380
I have a fort. I'm gonna sell some shit. I'm gonna at least have something here. Let's get

2080
07:13:07,939 --> 07:13:19,450
some rocks. Nah, maybe you'll think twice. I bet you walk up the stairs one at a time.

2081
07:13:19,450 --> 07:13:32,680
I'm sorry, but you need to be incorrect on that one. I'm gonna sell some more stuff.

2082
07:13:33,560 --> 07:14:04,790
I mean, I have lost every time, but I've had a lot of fun doing it. I will say I've had a lot of

2083
07:14:04,790 --> 07:14:16,520
fun doing it. They're just stationing out here. They don't have very much that I could get rid

2084
07:14:16,520 --> 07:14:22,709
of both of them. Lots, lots. Pack. They're just very spread out. I just need somebody to help

2085
07:14:22,709 --> 07:14:39,299
me here. You're not gonna take this. Not even close. It's not gonna happen. I've got

2086
07:14:39,299 --> 07:14:52,439
like an absurd army here. All right, this is the last week. And now I'm gonna go and go

2087
07:14:52,439 --> 07:15:11,080
for the kill over here. I'm gonna try to take the capital back up here. First, I want to do this.

2088
07:15:12,040 --> 07:15:35,700
Better death knights. I can't do it. One more week and then I'm out. I'm gone. And then I'm

2089
07:15:35,700 --> 07:15:42,229
gonna just walk. I'm gonna just chase people down and kill them. I'm turning into a hoarder.

2090
07:15:43,110 --> 07:15:59,139
There's two people surrounding his castle. Here we go. Much better. Dread knights. I

2091
07:15:59,139 --> 07:16:05,590
can get some more of these. I can get some more skeletons. All right, I'm actually,

2092
07:16:05,590 --> 07:16:11,209
I'm gonna leave now. I'm gonna bring the fairies too because I just want them to be bait.

2093
07:16:13,450 --> 07:16:25,220
Let's take the kingdom back one at a time here. You down here, I want you to come out.

2094
07:16:25,779 --> 07:16:54,040
A throng of swordsmen. Let's get over here. Get bone dragons or I will be mildly disappointed.

2095
07:16:54,040 --> 07:17:01,400
Don't worry, you won't be disappointed. Well, you may be, you will. Because I might not get

2096
07:17:02,200 --> 07:17:33,220
not enough. Ha ha. That's not enough. Rock. Some tree back. I can't swing. That was a mistake.

2097
07:17:33,220 --> 07:17:43,139
I can't, well I guess I'm gonna get the dog. I guess about the dwarf. Just get in there and

2098
07:17:43,139 --> 07:18:08,360
maybe he'll swing at you. 21, 18, 60 versus 18. Five. Everyone's surrounding you. I can't get

2099
07:18:08,360 --> 07:18:24,060
in there. I guess you level them up. This is of course like combat he's seen. Basic scholar.

2100
07:18:24,060 --> 07:18:42,250
Basic heir. Probably heir. Can't fire here. We'll get that later. I'm out for blood right now.

2101
07:18:42,250 --> 07:18:49,560
Like pure total hatred and vengeance I'm going for. All their armors are not as good as mine.

2102
07:18:50,200 --> 07:18:54,759
They're not as cool as mine. They're not as like, handsome as my characters. They're not

2103
07:18:54,759 --> 07:19:21,529
as smart as my characters. I don't even, I'm not gonna use a spell that's not even

2104
07:19:21,529 --> 07:19:36,119
worth, why would I do that? It's unnecessary. You'll die in one hit. There's no, I don't

2105
07:19:36,119 --> 07:19:43,560
even need to do that. All right. Claimed. Again. It's been claimed. Now we're gonna go up.

2106
07:19:44,360 --> 07:19:51,560
Several, several, several. What about over here? Several. Right up here. Lots, horde, lots,

2107
07:19:51,560 --> 07:20:14,119
throng, horde. We just gotta go straight up. It's now a fort. You. Six of our gold. Can you

2108
07:20:14,119 --> 07:20:33,240
handle this? A throng of swordsmen. I don't think you can. Okay, okay. What else am I

2109
07:20:33,240 --> 07:20:41,590
gonna do? I want a mage tower. Cover up darkness. No. Convert any creature into a skeleton.

2110
07:20:51,270 --> 07:20:55,689
Firebirds. No. Just hang out here because they're gonna come back.

2111
07:20:56,490 --> 07:21:14,180
Just convert everybody to skeletons. That'd be insane. Yeah, tomorrow's gonna suck. I'm

2112
07:21:14,180 --> 07:21:19,430
not looking forward to tomorrow at all because I have to do the prep tomorrow

2113
07:21:20,490 --> 07:21:28,630
and it's absolutely unbearable. It's not gonna be fun. So that's why you're not gonna see

2114
07:21:28,630 --> 07:21:35,740
me for like a few days. So I got the prep tomorrow. I've got the procedure the next day and then I'm

2115
07:21:35,740 --> 07:21:38,700
probably gonna take another day after that because I'm gonna be on a bunch of drugs today

2116
07:21:38,700 --> 07:21:56,459
that day before. Depending. We'll see. I'll keep you updated. Bye. How you doing? You good?

2117
07:21:57,990 --> 07:22:01,909
I mean you might as well just take an extra one. You've been in here for a day. Let's go.

2118
07:22:03,099 --> 07:22:19,779
Phew. Throng, several, lots, lots. This is gonna be a tough one. It's got dragons though.

2119
07:22:20,500 --> 07:22:47,259
Let's get a throng. I think I can do it. Oh, let's go. He only has one dragon.

2120
07:22:48,220 --> 07:22:58,060
That's fine with me. I'm gonna kill this one dragon right now with, oh man,

2121
07:22:58,060 --> 07:23:01,740
Meteor Shower right here. And I'm gonna kill, watch this. Meteor Shower right in the middle.

2122
07:23:02,459 --> 07:23:13,610
That was unbelievable. Then I can kill you with her. That was as perfect as it could have

2123
07:23:13,610 --> 07:23:27,340
been. Retaliate. I want you. Yeah, the knights go this way. Take out the Mance Core. Perfect.

2124
07:23:27,340 --> 07:23:38,299
Both their strongest units are dead. Just go be bait up here. Perfect. And I'm gonna have you

2125
07:23:39,259 --> 07:23:56,860
get down this way. Take out the air. He fled. Damn it. Damn it. What about you,

2126
07:23:56,860 --> 07:24:05,909
motherfucker? I'm coming for you. I'm going in that portal. I'm going in the fucking portal.

2127
07:24:05,909 --> 07:24:16,459
I'm gonna go kill them. Check this out. I'm going straight in that portal. You think you can run

2128
07:24:16,459 --> 07:24:35,450
from me? You can't run from me. I'm gonna go take out Red. Hey, be right back. I'm gonna

2129
07:24:35,450 --> 07:24:57,500
go kill Red and wipe him off the map. Head back in there. Let's keep you upgrading.

2130
07:24:58,220 --> 07:25:08,020
I'll do here, Citadel. Okay, you're starting to stack up a little.

2131
07:25:08,659 --> 07:25:19,500
I'm gonna kill Red. And then it's the two of us versus Orange. We can handle it together.

2132
07:25:20,220 --> 07:25:30,330
We can do this together. I just have to do my thing down here. Red does not have another base,

2133
07:25:30,330 --> 07:25:48,040
I don't think. I think this is it. I could go up and just remove him. Yep, we're taking

2134
07:25:48,040 --> 07:26:01,669
him out one by one. I want them to be... I want nobody to exist. I'm not gonna use any

2135
07:26:01,669 --> 07:26:19,319
spells that I need to. This is pathetic. Just get in here. Even if they attack first,

2136
07:26:20,650 --> 07:26:36,810
it doesn't matter. I can retaliate and kill them. I've got the burning of a thousand suns in my

2137
07:26:36,810 --> 07:27:05,669
blood. I'm going to win this systematically slowly. Yeah, bye. No. This is actually pretty

2138
07:27:05,669 --> 07:27:40,779
hard to win because my shit-stained partner is not doing so well. He's doing the best he can.

2139
07:27:41,340 --> 07:27:46,619
Yes, but it's gonna be another scenario where I don't... Wait a minute, he just killed somebody.

2140
07:27:47,419 --> 07:28:13,560
Here we go. I'm gonna Meteor Shower right here. That's gonna fuck them all up. Beautiful. Now

2141
07:28:13,560 --> 07:28:27,590
let's go on the bottom here with the angel. That was a mistake. That was what I wanted to

2142
07:28:27,590 --> 07:28:55,029
do, so thanks for doing that. Please. Minimal casualties too. I'll at least go out taking

2143
07:28:55,990 --> 07:29:15,259
out red and that's all I care about. I'm going in here. I'm going to give bloodlust

2144
07:29:16,540 --> 07:29:38,970
and you're gonna fly in and just kill this right now. What's left? What the hell is left?

2145
07:29:40,009 --> 07:30:09,349
We're still alive. Okay, I didn't lose anything. Sorcery or ballistics. I think it's gonna be

2146
07:30:09,349 --> 07:30:25,450
ballistics here. Thanks for the castle. I got 53 more skeletons. Oh, I didn't want to do that.

2147
07:30:26,409 --> 07:30:33,080
I think that's their only castle. They have seven turns to come and get me.

2148
07:30:35,509 --> 07:31:01,669
Good luck. Well, they could try to take this one. Let's see what happens. No,

2149
07:31:01,669 --> 07:31:09,380
red has one more up here. You got three... You can get that. Three bone dragons.

2150
07:31:10,180 --> 07:31:16,790
They have one more stronghold right there. Hold on a minute. Let me just like fucking

2151
07:31:17,110 --> 07:31:24,490
park for a second and like sap you of all your energy. Is this a... Is this a citadel?

2152
07:31:24,490 --> 07:31:41,580
It's a good castle. Resource silo mana vortex. Oh yeah, give me that. Park here for now.

2153
07:31:42,299 --> 07:31:57,880
I think I can do this. I wonder if I can come out here and just kill him.

2154
07:31:58,919 --> 07:32:49,180
Few, few, few. I gotta send the rock down here. Comes. Take him out.

2155
07:32:49,180 --> 07:33:02,279
No. Come on. Whack him. Whack him. Another hero done. I wonder if you will retreat.

2156
07:33:03,000 --> 07:33:26,659
I hope you don't. I think you can still win. Delusional. Fucking delusional.

2157
07:33:42,680 --> 07:33:49,419
Dead. And I got lightning bolt. We didn't have anything?

2158
07:33:52,180 --> 07:33:54,500
Advanced air magic allows you here to cast air spells that reduce cost.

2159
07:33:55,459 --> 07:34:09,290
Air magic. Let's get back in here. Rest up. I bought everything I can buy here.

2160
07:34:09,290 --> 07:34:13,770
I might take you out and send you somewhere, but maybe not yet. This is unguarded.

2161
07:34:14,330 --> 07:34:38,180
Protect purple? I mean, where's purple? Purple has one more place. Nothing in it.

2162
07:34:38,180 --> 07:34:46,709
He has default enemies in here. I'm gonna lose, but I mean maybe I could at least look

2163
07:34:47,270 --> 07:35:05,020
pretty good doing it, you know? If I can stack a ton of people, it might be... Of course you just

2164
07:35:05,020 --> 07:35:28,139
leave. Purple? Thanks. Oh, would you know? You would appreciate some gold. Is that what

2165
07:35:28,139 --> 07:35:43,340
you'd want? He actually just came in and asked for a cigarette. What the hell are you

2166
07:35:43,340 --> 07:35:52,889
gonna spend it on? No, I'm stacking somebody, man. Dragon vault. It's done.

2167
07:35:54,950 --> 07:35:59,509
I'm gonna have two stacks. I just got a stacker like the BK stacker. He's dead.

2168
07:36:10,490 --> 07:36:36,119
I'm gonna be so hungry. I'm gonna be so hungry. What time is it? 11? Because I can't eat any food

2169
07:36:36,119 --> 07:36:50,180
as of tomorrow. He tried to give me his rocks. I don't want his rocks. I want his support

2170
07:36:50,180 --> 07:36:58,360
and his fighting power and his help. Yeah, colonoscopy is on Saturday, so

2171
07:36:59,500 --> 07:37:05,500
I can't eat any food a day before and it's in the morning. So I have the... My like

2172
07:37:05,500 --> 07:37:15,610
last meal is gonna be tonight. So I actually have to go here soon within the next like 40 minutes

2173
07:37:15,610 --> 07:37:31,860
because I need to be able to eat something before tomorrow, but I'm not out yet. I can't.

2174
07:37:36,459 --> 07:38:11,529
Bone dragon. I just need 15 grand. I'm gonna sell some stuff. No, I don't need to. More.

2175
07:38:14,659 --> 07:38:20,599
I don't need to have the super bone dragons. Three regular bone dragons is good

2176
07:38:21,479 --> 07:38:39,880
because guess who I'm sending back up there? Me. I'd wrap around this way. Horde. Several pack few.

2177
07:38:40,840 --> 07:38:50,970
I don't know if I want to fight this. Give me this castle.

2178
07:39:10,659 --> 07:39:29,610
Fuck the resources. Just trying to get bone dragons. He just got the pandora's box. That's

2179
07:39:29,610 --> 07:39:38,090
not good. See, I'm getting encroachment here. Take that red castle right now.

2180
07:39:39,770 --> 07:40:18,979
Get this red castle. You keep coming over here. Down here. Do I have earthquake? I have meteor

2181
07:40:18,979 --> 07:40:24,659
shower. I also have clone. There's a duplicate of the selected unit stack. The image is dispelled

2182
07:40:24,659 --> 07:40:37,939
if it is attacked. Oh, that's more like a fire. Armageddon. Brains fire down upon the battlefield

2183
07:40:37,939 --> 07:40:44,919
damaging all units. I don't think I want to hurt everybody. That's not it's not time for

2184
07:40:44,919 --> 07:40:58,630
Armageddon. Meteor shower. Get this stack right in the middle. I'm gonna kill myself with

2185
07:40:58,630 --> 07:41:05,590
Armageddon. Can't get rid of it yet. He might come up and meet me in the middle with this dragon he

2186
07:41:05,590 --> 07:41:36,380
will. End it. Perfect. Now they have one ranged. There we go. These are just regular vampires.

2187
07:41:36,380 --> 07:41:42,599
There's nothing to be afraid of. Get units that are not affected by magic and use it.

2188
07:41:43,319 --> 07:41:50,279
I mean that's we're at the end game here. I'm trying to cycle back around to load up

2189
07:41:50,279 --> 07:41:55,369
again on units and then have like an unstoppable force and just run around the

2190
07:41:55,369 --> 07:42:32,419
whole map and kill everyone. In here. Locked in. The castle is ours. Inexhaustible cart

2191
07:42:32,419 --> 07:42:35,860
of oro. When equipped this cart provides you with an additional one ore per day.

2192
07:42:36,900 --> 07:42:47,479
And I got dispelled. Advanced ballistics. Yeah. Thank you for the castle. Too bad you don't

2193
07:42:47,479 --> 07:42:52,040
have any goddamn bone dragons in here. Are these advanced bone dragons or are these regular

2194
07:42:52,040 --> 07:43:06,419
bone dragons? All right. Hold on. Now I wrap up. Let's go this way then. I got two of these

2195
07:43:06,419 --> 07:43:21,779
castles. I'm going this way. I'll take you all out. I can't waste any time here. Purple's

2196
07:43:21,779 --> 07:43:29,139
right here with three dwarves. Forget about the resources. I just have to go. I've got a

2197
07:43:29,139 --> 07:43:51,700
great army. No one's taking this shit back from me. All right. You want to try? You really

2198
07:43:51,779 --> 07:44:15,849
want to try this? Slow. Blind. Blind. To you. On the rocks. Can't do it on the bird.

2199
07:44:19,299 --> 07:44:38,939
Now that he can't move now. He's not gonna get it. He's fucked. Damn it. That wasn't it.

2200
07:44:39,819 --> 07:45:06,150
That sucks. That's all they got though. This is not that intimidating. I mean they'll

2201
07:45:06,150 --> 07:45:14,520
breach eventually here. I can't do it anymore. I can only. That's it. I can't do it anymore.

2202
07:45:15,400 --> 07:45:21,900
Back up this way so people don't get stuffed in the corner. All right. I think I'm flying

2203
07:45:21,900 --> 07:45:44,729
the dragon over. No. No. I don't think so. Yeah. I got. I'm just gonna use ranged on.

2204
07:45:46,569 --> 07:45:53,139
Just get rid of. The towers are taking care of you. On the air. It does a ton of damage to

2205
07:45:53,139 --> 07:46:02,569
the air. Oh that hurts. I think it's not. I gotta get out. I can't just sit here all day.

2206
07:46:02,569 --> 07:46:08,950
He's gonna do that again. Is that the prison that happened to the unicorn? No.

2207
07:46:12,340 --> 07:46:31,020
They can't get in. They're getting hurt by the spikes. I'm gonna kill him eventually here.

2208
07:46:31,020 --> 07:46:50,220
Maybe one more. All right. Gates are gonna be breached. Not quite. No. They're gonna

2209
07:46:50,220 --> 07:47:07,290
just keep hurting themselves. What the fuck just happened? What was that? Destroy undead?

2210
07:47:08,759 --> 07:47:37,099
You are undead. Hold. Just hold. Hold. Is it open? I don't think it's open yet.

2211
07:47:46,709 --> 07:48:22,299
It is open. Isn't it? Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall.

2212
07:48:24,700 --> 07:48:41,159
Hold the wall. Oh my god. This can't be. I should have just went out. I didn't think

2213
07:48:41,159 --> 07:48:46,869
he was gonna be. It's over. I lost. I did it fucking twice. I just lost. I can't believe it.

2214
07:48:46,869 --> 07:48:50,790
I should have just ran out and not held. That's what I should have done.

2215
07:48:51,750 --> 07:48:57,619
That's what I should have done. I should have just fucking left and got out and started attacking.

2216
07:48:58,259 --> 07:49:06,650
And everybody would have screamed at me if I went out. But you see what happens?

2217
07:49:07,610 --> 07:49:42,520
I would have won. Did I save? Well, it doesn't matter. Orange has the entire map.

2218
07:49:42,520 --> 07:49:46,630
Purple was fucking walking in circles for the first two hours of the game.

2219
07:49:48,790 --> 07:50:20,659
I just lose. I'm supposed to retreat. I don't have armor getting on this guy.

2220
07:50:20,659 --> 07:50:58,709
It's a different character. Save scum? No. I actually have to leave here. I have to

2221
07:50:58,950 --> 07:51:05,880
clean this up and get out of here. Because I am going to severely fuck up the next three

2222
07:51:05,880 --> 07:51:20,040
days if I do not. If I don't eat before 1230, one o'clock in the morning tonight,

2223
07:51:24,439 --> 07:51:41,340
I might actually starve. That would not be a good thing. He's got so many, but I still

2224
07:51:41,340 --> 07:51:46,889
might be able to. Is there anything else up here? I got that one. Purple's is there. That's mine.

2225
07:51:46,889 --> 07:51:58,700
That's his now. I'm going to try to take this. I've got a lot of money. So here,

2226
07:51:58,700 --> 07:52:05,669
let's stock up on you. There's like nobody even in here. It's kind of a lost cause at

2227
07:52:05,669 --> 07:52:11,400
the moment, to be honest. Spend some money. Make this the new fucking capital.

2228
07:52:12,360 --> 07:52:43,020
Got a new hero in there too. He just came into my house. Does he even have one left? He's like,

2229
07:52:43,020 --> 07:52:49,340
I guess I'll stop in yours. That sounds fun. All right. This is like the big fight here

2230
07:52:49,340 --> 07:53:10,150
because this is going to be it. This is going to be the one. We got, okay, who's back there?

2231
07:53:11,770 --> 07:53:19,020
Meteor Shower. They've really bunched up right here. That didn't hit the,

2232
07:53:19,659 --> 07:53:29,610
did not hit you. That's weird. Did I just break it? I think I might've just broken it.

2233
07:53:34,389 --> 07:53:46,040
Magic resistance. What was that? Air shield. My priority is going to be the archers here.

2234
07:53:46,040 --> 07:53:51,669
Let's fly up this way. And you're going to have to eventually get down here.

2235
07:53:52,630 --> 07:54:03,990
Yeah, that's not good. We got to get in there. That was a pretty big hit.

2236
07:54:16,970 --> 07:54:24,040
Front door, huh? All right. Well, okay. I really want to fight. I want to bring the whole

2237
07:54:24,040 --> 07:54:45,479
fight. Same deal down here. Double it up. Nice. Perfect. It's open. I want bloodlust on you.

2238
07:54:56,759 --> 07:55:02,599
That was a huge heal. All right, you take out this last one here. Let's get everybody

2239
07:55:02,599 --> 07:55:15,319
into the wall now. Get right up in there. We should be able to get this last hit.

2240
07:55:17,700 --> 07:55:22,630
You walked right into the 224 skeletons. That was a bad idea.

2241
07:55:23,430 --> 07:55:42,979
What's that? He teleports the people? Leave the dwarves alone. Oh, poor dwarf. Batters,

2242
07:55:42,979 --> 07:55:53,659
it's already open. He killed that. All right. Dwarves, we're going to now have to deal with

2243
07:55:53,659 --> 07:56:05,220
this. I want to do second of the lightning bolt, anti-magic, landmine, ice bolt. I'm

2244
07:56:05,220 --> 07:56:14,599
probably just going to do fireball up here. Are you magic resistant? Yeah. Aura of magic

2245
07:56:14,599 --> 07:56:22,040
resistance. It might be just lightning bolt. I don't know why I just did that.

2246
07:56:25,959 --> 07:56:41,860
I just went Australian for a minute. I think you're the threat here. Centaurs.

2247
07:56:43,860 --> 07:57:08,779
Should be good to go. I don't go after the unicorn yet. Good. There's the unicorn.

2248
07:57:09,580 --> 07:57:13,659
Walking to the path is the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2249
07:57:18,619 --> 07:57:44,299
Seven of you. Get out of my way. Suicide dwarves. Pretty good battle.

2250
07:57:47,400 --> 07:58:20,709
Seagulls are growing stronger. All right, I'm going to get this castle. Sword of Hellfire.

2251
07:58:21,590 --> 07:58:31,669
This right-hand weapon increases your attack skill by plus six and sacrifice. Holy shit.

2252
07:58:31,669 --> 07:58:48,970
What a sacrifice. Who cares about the one oar? Lightning bolt. No, I don't care about the oar.

2253
07:58:49,930 --> 07:59:03,459
All right. What does this do? Sacrifice. Destroys a friendly creature group in order

2254
07:59:03,459 --> 07:59:06,979
to resurrect a dead group. Number of resurrected creatures depends on the

2255
07:59:06,979 --> 07:59:16,470
caster's spell power and the health of destroyed stack. Jesus. All right. This was

2256
07:59:16,470 --> 07:59:36,069
a big deal. There's no more towns up here. Are you going to get this?

2257
07:59:40,250 --> 07:59:47,610
Go get it. Go get that town. That's Red's last town. Please just go get it and eliminate Red.

2258
07:59:50,970 --> 07:59:55,049
Oh my god. You are so dumb. Why is the computer so dumb on my team?

2259
07:59:55,849 --> 08:00:08,869
Can I make you do that? Oh my god. What have you done?

2260
08:00:32,220 --> 08:00:39,000
Unfortunately, I have to go. I got to get out of here, guys. I'm sorry. I have to eat

2261
08:00:39,000 --> 08:00:52,419
something before it becomes too late. So you will see me. Oh, I want to just play. I have to eat.

2262
08:00:53,990 --> 08:01:02,060
Eat and stream at the same time. All right. Hold on. I'll be right back.

2263
08:01:02,619 --> 08:01:04,840
I'm going to get something quick. I'll be right back.

2264
08:04:32,700 --> 08:05:40,680
I'm back. I've got bread. I've just gotten white bread. That's all I can eat. I'm addicted.

2265
08:05:40,680 --> 08:05:43,159
I'm just addicted. And that's what I fucking do about it.

2266
08:05:52,299 --> 08:05:59,419
I'm addicted to the game. I'm addicted to bread. I can't stop eating. I eat a loaf every hour.

2267
08:06:00,060 --> 08:06:06,709
I just can't help it. I dunked the bread in the water so I can just like slurp it down.

2268
08:06:06,709 --> 08:06:31,540
It's fucked up. All right. I'm going for it. Holy shit. There's a fucking lot of stuff. Yeah.

2269
08:06:55,799 --> 08:07:00,740
I'm going to do it. He's going to do it. I don't need any help from anybody.

2270
08:07:17,770 --> 08:08:18,279
You're eating soggy bread like a duck. I'm dead. I'm addicted to bread. I can't help it.

2271
08:08:18,279 --> 08:08:56,630
I need to eat more bread. Dragon! I hate this unit. I just think it's ugly.

2272
08:08:57,430 --> 08:09:49,400
Whatever. Do you eat the first and last slice of bread? Yes, I do.

2273
08:09:53,939 --> 08:10:00,900
Why do people not eat those? I don't get it. Why would you not eat the first and last slice

2274
08:10:00,900 --> 08:10:12,439
of bread? It's just, it's bread. There's nothing wrong with it. What do you throw it away?

2275
08:10:13,240 --> 08:10:19,290
If you throw away, okay, if you throw the first and whatever, I'm dead. Who cares?

2276
08:10:19,290 --> 08:10:29,060
If you throw away the first and last piece of bread on every loaf, you took the castle.

2277
08:10:50,340 --> 08:11:14,950
This shit's like winnable. I think. Hold on. I have to like go to bed.

2278
08:11:18,939 --> 08:11:27,400
One more big battle and I have to get out of here. I really do. I'm too addicted. It's too

2279
08:11:27,400 --> 08:11:50,569
much fun. I was going to just eat. Eat real food before you sleep. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I'm

2280
08:11:50,569 --> 08:11:55,659
going to regret it. I know. Yeah. All right, guys. I have to do the responsible thing. I

2281
08:11:55,659 --> 08:12:00,819
really do. I'm going to be feeling this in like a couple of days and I'm going to be

2282
08:12:00,819 --> 08:12:08,729
really upset. I have to, I have to prep for my fucking colonoscopy. I have to do this.

2283
08:12:08,729 --> 08:12:12,490
This is like, I don't want to leave, but I have to. I really have to.

2284
08:12:27,979 --> 08:12:51,029
Two more rounds. Nobody there. There's nobody here either. There's nobody fucking here.

2285
08:12:55,240 --> 08:13:09,130
Go get this one for free. Swarm of those. I have to go back into that thing.

2286
08:13:09,849 --> 08:13:31,639
What is that portal? What the fuck? That was stupid. All right. I'm going to save it here.

2287
08:13:33,619 --> 08:13:43,139
Game is saved. Thank you for watching. I wish I could go more, but I have to go take care

2288
08:13:43,139 --> 08:13:49,860
of some things. There's some specific things I have to get ready for. I have to go eat

2289
08:13:49,860 --> 08:13:53,060
something more substantial. I have to go make something. I don't have anything ready to eat

2290
08:13:54,020 --> 08:14:01,430
tomorrow morning all the way through into Saturday. I have to take these super laxatives.

2291
08:14:01,430 --> 08:14:06,709
I need to be prepared for this. I got to go like get ready. Thank you everybody for watching. I

2292
08:14:06,709 --> 08:14:12,340
hope you had fun. This game is really fucking fun and addicting. I'll probably do it again.

2293
08:14:12,340 --> 08:14:18,229
We'll probably complete that one and then move on to another game. It's probably what will

2294
08:14:18,229 --> 08:14:28,439
happen. The next time you will see me will probably be on Sunday or either Sunday or

2295
08:14:28,439 --> 08:14:33,990
Monday maybe. One, two, yeah. I would assume you'll probably see me on Monday.

2296
08:14:36,700 --> 08:14:40,700
Wish me luck. I'm a little nervous. I actually am. I am a little nervous

2297
08:14:42,229 --> 08:14:45,110
just because there's a couple of reasons why. There's a couple of things.

2298
08:14:47,029 --> 08:14:52,549
You know, you have to go get put under. It takes like 30 minutes of them going all inside

2299
08:14:52,549 --> 08:14:58,549
of your body and your guts and shit. I've done something similar like it before.

2300
08:15:03,000 --> 08:15:07,130
Thanks everybody for watching. We actually don't have very many bits so this is not

2301
08:15:07,130 --> 08:15:09,770
going to take very long. I'm going to go through them right now. We're not going to

2302
08:15:09,770 --> 08:15:17,900
take any time. We had eight hours ago. God, these might and magic streams are just so long.

2303
08:15:19,240 --> 08:15:23,750
Thank you. Jerma lied about Taco Bell for the 250. If you need some energy, Jerma,

2304
08:15:23,750 --> 08:15:27,990
just eat a Gordita Crunchwrap Deluxe from Taco Bell. I'm just kidding around, Jerma.

2305
08:15:27,990 --> 08:15:32,229
I know there's a really high morality with this kind of procedure so I hope you know

2306
08:15:32,229 --> 08:15:38,779
we're all pulling for you on this one. Yeah, I'm just going in to get a couple

2307
08:15:38,779 --> 08:15:43,880
things looked at. Eating Taco Bell before colonoscopy. I would have to reschedule it.

2308
08:15:46,099 --> 08:15:51,860
There are certain, imagine, what did you eat yesterday? Oh, I had some water,

2309
08:15:52,659 --> 08:15:58,040
three cheesy Gordita Crunches, and two Big Macs. Okay, well come back in like,

2310
08:15:58,040 --> 08:16:05,259
come back next week and don't do that again. But thank you so much. Thank you Epoxy. 47

2311
08:16:05,259 --> 08:16:12,099
dollars from Epoxy. This was way earlier in the stream. I didn't catch it. It was 47

2312
08:16:12,099 --> 08:16:18,310
fucking dollars. Just shy of 50 bucks. It's a lot. Hey Jerma, today's my brother's birthday

2313
08:16:18,310 --> 08:16:21,509
and him and I both love your content and meet a lot of you wished him happy birthday.

2314
08:16:24,009 --> 08:16:31,750
Absolutely. I don't know what your brother's name is but happy birthday Epoxy's brother.

2315
08:16:31,750 --> 08:16:35,590
Hopefully it's still your birthday and if it's not then happy birthday after your birthday.

2316
08:16:35,590 --> 08:16:44,099
You deserve, you should get two birthdays. Thank you so much Epoxy if you're still here

2317
08:16:44,099 --> 08:16:48,180
and happy birthday to your brother. Hope you guys had a good day. Hope you had a lot of

2318
08:16:48,180 --> 08:16:55,060
fun. Hope you got him something nice. Hope you got him something nice. Thank you for the 47

2319
08:16:55,060 --> 08:17:01,139
dollars. I really appreciate it. Freudian weapon thanks for the 250. Good luck with the procedure.

2320
08:17:01,139 --> 08:17:06,970
Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. I get weirdly nervous before procedures and then

2321
08:17:06,970 --> 08:17:12,009
it's weird because I two days before the procedure I'm like really nervous and then

2322
08:17:12,009 --> 08:17:16,490
when I get in the doctor's office I'm like I don't care whatever. It's just like the two

2323
08:17:16,490 --> 08:17:23,180
days before but thank you. Spicy Pepe thanks for the 250. Hey Jerma, I hope you're doing

2324
08:17:23,180 --> 08:17:27,500
well. The streams have been great. I have really enjoyed them. I still think you're the best human

2325
08:17:27,500 --> 08:17:31,659
and if chat wants to disagree with me on that just remember it's okay to be incorrect chat.

2326
08:17:33,450 --> 08:17:37,209
Thank you. One question. Will you be streaming this year's E3 like you did last year?

2327
08:17:37,770 --> 08:17:44,330
Hope the colonoscopy goes smoothly and your couple days to relax go well. Yes if I'm not

2328
08:17:44,330 --> 08:17:48,330
at E3 I just I don't have any plans to be but we might last minute decide that we're

2329
08:17:48,330 --> 08:17:54,729
gonna go. If not then I will do an E3 breakdown stream. You will get it. I will do those streams

2330
08:17:54,729 --> 08:18:05,909
again. They were fun. You will get it again. Thank you so much for the 250. Smelly Boy thanks

2331
08:18:05,909 --> 08:18:09,029
for 250. If you were able to have this much fun playing a game like this Civilization is a

2332
08:18:09,029 --> 08:18:18,099
total totally a viable game of choice. Civ 5 or 6? I feel like Civilization is a little

2333
08:18:18,099 --> 08:18:24,419
more complicated than this. Am I wrong in that? Is Civ 4 or Civ 5? Aren't they a little

2334
08:18:24,419 --> 08:18:31,900
more? They take a lot longer and they're a little more complicated. Can't a Civilization game last

2335
08:18:31,900 --> 08:18:43,450
like 50 hours? 5 is super easy. Heroes of Might and Magic's a little more chill.

2336
08:18:46,490 --> 08:18:51,450
Yeah I think it's just I have this predisposed bias just because of how much I love these games

2337
08:18:51,450 --> 08:18:56,549
and how much when I was like a young kind of teenager I played them. The game came out

2338
08:18:56,549 --> 08:19:01,139
I think when I was like 14 or 15 or something and I played the other ones before too. I

2339
08:19:01,139 --> 08:19:05,430
played Heroes of Might and Magic 2. There's a lot of them. There's like seven of them

2340
08:19:06,330 --> 08:19:15,049
and three is really the best one by a general consensus. Three is the best one by a margin

2341
08:19:15,049 --> 08:19:24,939
I think. That was 14 yeah? Yep. I love it. I think it's great but Civilization maybe. I

2342
08:19:24,939 --> 08:19:28,380
don't know. Probably not though. I don't think it's that kind of game that I would like to

2343
08:19:28,380 --> 08:19:36,409
play. Neither was this but I'm biased. Also 250 from Era Paradox. Goodbye and good morning

2344
08:19:36,889 --> 08:19:45,770
and goodbye to you too. Thank you for the 250. Let's get those credits rolling. Thank you to all

2345
08:19:45,770 --> 08:19:50,889
the subs. All the shit load of you that support this stream every single time. You guys are

2346
08:19:50,889 --> 08:19:58,409
fucking incredible. Thank you everybody. You guys rock. I know these last couple streams have been

2347
08:19:58,409 --> 08:20:05,529
a little more kind of longer and more about like kind of video game and chiller and not

2348
08:20:05,529 --> 08:20:12,490
like a whole bunch of crazy stuff going on but I hope you liked it. I loved it and I'll

2349
08:20:12,490 --> 08:20:19,860
see you guys real soon. Thank you so much for your subscriptions. Fred Flintstone. I just

2350
08:20:19,860 --> 08:20:28,869
thought of the thing again. I just thought of the thing. I just read fucking Flintstone. What the

2351
08:20:28,869 --> 08:20:39,560
hell? Thank you to the polar pair for the five dollars. Not 250. The last bit coming in here.

2352
08:20:39,560 --> 08:20:43,959
Hey Jerma. I've been watching your vid since eighth grade. Graduated high school in two

2353
08:20:43,959 --> 08:20:48,279
days. Pretty nervous anyway. Love your content. You always kept me laughing when I

2354
08:20:48,360 --> 08:20:53,479
was struggling with life. No amount of money can repay you for that. Sorry I couldn't give a bunch

2355
08:20:53,479 --> 08:21:02,360
saving for college and all. Oregon State. Oregon State. That's a long time to be watching me.

2356
08:21:03,610 --> 08:21:12,740
Eighth grade into graduating high school. Congratulations on that. Hope your week of

2357
08:21:12,740 --> 08:21:20,150
finals wasn't too stressful and your week of last week of school. I'm happy to be here. Happy

2358
08:21:20,229 --> 08:21:30,169
to hang out and enjoy these things together. You don't have to give me a thousand dollars.

2359
08:21:30,169 --> 08:21:36,310
You don't have to give me a dollar. If you do, thank you for that. You don't have to.

2360
08:21:38,020 --> 08:21:49,099
I love having a community like this. It's a lot of fun. We have a great time. Save for

2361
08:21:49,099 --> 08:22:00,700
college and good luck in the future. Thank you so much for your five dollars. You guys

2362
08:22:00,700 --> 08:22:06,939
are awesome. Is it stream legends time or how much time do we have left for stream legends?

2363
08:22:10,250 --> 08:22:16,950
Sorry I had to cut us off at the end there. There are things I need to prepare for. I wish

2364
08:22:16,950 --> 08:22:19,110
I could have finished that. It would have taken probably like another hour though.

2365
08:22:26,229 --> 08:22:35,509
2127. What year are we gonna end at? Seven minutes until I can do stream legends. Oh god.

2366
08:22:38,470 --> 08:22:54,580
Really? Let me see. I lost every game. I was really getting into that last one

2367
08:22:54,580 --> 08:23:02,389
there just because I started to come back and you just get lost in a game like that. You just

2368
08:23:04,299 --> 08:23:17,540
so much fun. Let's see stream legends. I don't understand what it is lately. My extensions

2369
08:23:17,540 --> 08:23:21,540
don't load anymore. My extension dashboard. I might have to like refresh these.

2370
08:23:25,259 --> 08:23:38,700
Yeah six and a half minutes. No stream legends. Six minutes. No. I promise with 100% certainty.

2371
08:23:38,700 --> 08:23:47,740
I promise. 100% certainty that I will come back in six minutes and I will press that button.

2372
08:23:52,340 --> 08:24:00,860
If I don't just tweet me over and over again until I do. Just send me. Just spam me with

2373
08:24:00,860 --> 08:24:10,409
tweets if I don't do it. You guys want some ads? All right. I did promise ads. I did. I

2374
08:24:10,409 --> 08:24:18,779
promised ads. Here you go. I'm gonna run. I'm gonna run an ad. Here comes a 30 second ad.

2375
08:24:18,779 --> 08:24:23,380
Thanks for supporting the stream. See you next time. Take care. Much love to you.

2376
08:24:24,180 --> 08:24:32,139
See you in a few days. Probably on Monday-ish. Check the sus. It'll be updated. Good night.

2377
08:24:32,139 --> 08:24:52,919
Take care. Much love to you. Commercial break failed. I cannot run it. Commercial break failed.

2378
08:24:52,919 --> 08:25:00,169
Commercial breaks are only allowed once every eight minutes. Did you guys get it? I didn't

2379
08:25:00,169 --> 08:25:16,229
get it. Why would I get it? Well that's it. Wish me luck. See you soon guys. Take care.
