1
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:07,540
I love this comment, what he said.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:14,300
LOL, he's streaming the entirety of Columbo on his other channel.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,989
Why do you know what Columbo is?

4
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,620
Why do you know what that is?

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:35,500
Do they still play Columbo on like TBS for like 8 hours a day?

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Do they still do that?

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:48,579
I want to know what the royalties and kind of syndication rights that the Columbo producers have.

8
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:58,329
Because Columbo has been I think syndicated and on more networks than Seinfeld and Friends combined.

9
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:09,000
I think there's like a 20% chance that if you change through television channels, you'll land on Columbo.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,370
It's still like that. I did not know that.

11
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,250
How are you? Good to see you.

12
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,180
Things are going well. Give me one sec.

13
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:33,099
Oh, I thought I muted the mic.

14
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,730
Holy shit, why did the mic not mute?

15
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,900
That button doesn't work.

16
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:45,019
I just like moved my microphone to be closer to my face and I thought I muted it.

17
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,019
I usually do. I usually catch that.

18
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,019
But this button doesn't work.

19
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,019
I'm really sorry. That should not have happened.

20
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:54,219
I'm doing pretty good. I'm doing good.

21
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:57,489
Let me just make a tweet.

22
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:03,760
Ailee streamer?

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
He said, well, why are you 6 hours late?

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,289
Well, here's the thing.

25
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:17,280
Yesterday, I was supposed to stream at what?

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,650
Four o'clock yesterday?

27
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,680
But what happened was I ended up playing.

28
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:34,759
I delayed the stream by like three or four hours and then played with Ludwig, Charlie and Connor.

29
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,639
And then the stream that was supposed to happen yesterday is happening just today.

30
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,939
I mean, whatever. Oops, wrong Discord.

31
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,419
Whatever.

32
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,419
I'm tweeting. I'm tweeting. I'm tweeting. Just wait.

33
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,419
I'm tweeting.

34
00:02:49,419 --> 00:03:30,770
Oops, wrong Discord.

35
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:37,099
I got the ID wrong.

36
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,379
It's whatever.

37
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,379
Was that even that bad?

38
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,379
OK, the joke wasn't bad. It was the execution.

39
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,810
That was the problem.

40
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,810
I had great joke writers yesterday.

41
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,810
It's just I, as the actor, screwed it up.

42
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,879
Right?

43
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
I'm also the writer too, so don't get mad.

44
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,409
That was a good one.

45
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,669
It was so bad. It was embarrassing.

46
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:13,580
Was it really though? I don't think so.

47
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,339
Pre-written stream.

48
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,339
I told you guys this, but I have on my third monitor over here.

49
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,339
You notice how sometimes I kind of look over and I'm not looking over at you guys?

50
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,339
Like the chat room. I'm looking at the other monitor.

51
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:31,339
I have about six to seven thousand jokes that I have written out as one sentence.

52
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,339
Kind of like little references from when I was a kid or whatever.

53
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,339
Just here.

54
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,339
And I just look over and I pick one.

55
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:40,579
And I just say it.

56
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,579
It's a really, really good tip if you're trying to stream to an audience.

57
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:48,579
It's like I have six or seven thousand, kind of one sentence.

58
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,579
Like when aliens show up.

59
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,579
That kind of shit, right?

60
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:57,060
That's like a sentence here.

61
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,060
If I hit control F, find D, and I type Duncan.

62
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,420
It's two or three hundred of these lines here.

63
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,420
It's like Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan, Duncan.

64
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,420
So it's like pretty much any scenario.

65
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,420
I can just do it.

66
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,420
It's kind of like an encyclopedia.

67
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,350
You guys ready to play MS-DOS?

68
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,420
All these cutaway gags.

69
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:28,720
You should do a naked joke.

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:37,550
Well, a naked joke turns into a banned joke.

71
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,550
I just turn on the full face cam.

72
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,550
And just, I just am naked and I just point at the camera and go.

73
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,550
Got ya!

74
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,560
And then like the not like this image shows up.

75
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
And my stream's just gone.

76
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,339
How is that a joke?

77
00:05:53,339 --> 00:06:05,160
Oh ha, that would be funny.

78
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
It's with you guys.

79
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,620
Alright, so we're gonna play MS-DOS.

80
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,620
It's returning.

81
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,620
It's been a long time since I've played it.

82
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,620
The last MS-DOS stream I believe was probably like two years ago.

83
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,259
It's been a very long time.

84
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,259
It's been like at least a year or two.

85
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:24,269
I used to do this once a week.

86
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:30,959
Because there are probably a thousand plus MS-DOS pieces of software.

87
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:37,550
So we're gonna play.

88
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,990
This is how we're gonna do it.

89
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,990
The first one is gonna be a big fan favorite I think.

90
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:54,839
One of the most requested DOS games that I've received since saying I was gonna go back to this.

91
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,170
No, not Wolfenstein.

92
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,370
Nope.

93
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,370
No, we're talking about Jump Start Kindergarten.

94
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:09,300
That's the one that's been requested a lot.

95
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:18,310
I was told that the music in this game is the only reason to play it.

96
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,769
But we're gonna find out what that means.

97
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:24,459
Finally, a game fitting for chat.

98
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:28,100
I wonder how excited...

99
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Okay, this is...

100
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,100
If you guys resident sleeper this game, I'm gonna be real pissed.

101
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,790
I'm gonna be very unhappy if this is like,

102
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:40,300
Ah dude, next, hurry up.

103
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,370
Everybody pretend Pogs until the thing that they pretend Pogging actually shows up.

104
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:55,839
I've learned this over the years.

105
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,839
I, you know, I get Pog-lit all the time.

106
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,839
You guys are just Pog-lighting me a lot.

107
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,839
Oh my god, you didn't...

108
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,839
No, dude, you gotta do Pog.

109
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,839
Pogchamp, oh my god, Pog.

110
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,839
He's gonna do it.

111
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,660
And then I do it.

112
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
This fucking sucks, dude.

113
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
Fucking do something else.

114
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,660
I would rather you play Picross, dude.

115
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
Get the fuck out of here.

116
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Fucking turn your stream off.

117
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,160
Alright, here we go.

118
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Jump Start Kindergarten number one is the first one we're gonna do.

119
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Let's do it.

120
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,329
You guys ready?

121
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:28,329
Are you?

122
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:31,870
I know.

123
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:46,269
Alright, it's so far so good.

124
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:52,399
That we're at school.

125
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:58,659
This is the song.

126
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:08,669
This is the song here?

127
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:09,669
This is crazy.

128
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:16,710
I love the tuba.

129
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,549
What about the garden?

130
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:22,179
Can I go to the garden?

131
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,179
Everything is clickable.

132
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:26,179
This was huge back in the fucking forties.

133
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:28,610
Everything was clickable.

134
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,610
Yup, you didn't...

135
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,610
Oh, Gerber, you can't click on the tree and have oranges spawn.

136
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,610
What are you, fucking dumb?

137
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:42,659
Whoa!

138
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,090
Whoa!

139
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,929
I need to do these streams more often.

140
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,929
This is really easy content.

141
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:58,179
Do you guys see?

142
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,179
Oh, they're on a swing.

143
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:10,549
Oh, and he's not getting pog-lighted.

144
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:12,549
No, I'm not this time.

145
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:13,549
Alright, let's go.

146
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:14,549
Let's get it.

147
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:17,009
There's a note.

148
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:18,440
What does the note say?

149
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,059
Type each letter of your name on the keyboard.

150
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,299
Click on the doorknob when you're done.

151
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:30,000
That's great.

152
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,820
I bet you it's the same person that did every single voice in the whole game.

153
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,529
You want to talk about, like, compassionate game devs?

154
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:44,019
This is the programmer.

155
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,019
This is the voice actor.

156
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,019
This is the guy that made all the puzzles.

157
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,669
One man show, truly.

158
00:10:51,669 --> 00:11:00,740
Um, Anthony.

159
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:10,500
Good afternoon.

160
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Hey.

161
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
I'm Mr. Hopsalot, your teacher.

162
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,740
What?

163
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Click on anything you see or click on my ears for a surprise.

164
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,940
The teacher?

165
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,519
Click on my ears for a surprise.

166
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,519
Ready?

167
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's try a puzzle.

168
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,429
What?

169
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:33,429
No.

170
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:34,429
I don't want to.

171
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:35,429
No.

172
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,429
Let's learn about letter sounds.

173
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,659
Um.

174
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:43,899
Find the object that starts with the sound of W.

175
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:44,899
Iron.

176
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:45,899
Dirty.

177
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:46,899
Wrench.

178
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:47,899
Square.

179
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:48,899
Nail.

180
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:49,899

402
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:53,710
what do i do click here to read a dinosaur storybook play the name of sorus game play

403
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:00,929
the read a sorus game explore the world of dinosaurs or click to see movies about dinosaurs

404
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:28,269
i think we're gonna see the movies where the fuck is this footage from this is from a theme park

405
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:43,710
or something this is weird that's it this would scare the shit out of me when i was a kid because

406
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:59,760
this is real where is this from animatronic animals especially animatronic dinosaurs are

407
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:08,670
terrifying even to this day to this day going on that was that that like jurassic park ride with

408
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:14,349
the t-rex where you go down and the t-rex's huge animatronic head is just right there

409
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:22,659
that's something so unsettling about that even in my 30s i just i don't like it i do not like it

410
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:51,789
i'm very curious where this footage is from is that what a dinosaur sounds like

411
00:44:52,269 --> 00:45:01,760
they're anisora i'll repeat we've already seen it all right what are the other activities

412
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,329
these are not animatronics what the hell are they then what are you talking about all right

413
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:15,570
how about a read a dinosaur storybook long long ago animals called dinosaurs lived on the earth

414
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:39,280
there were big ones small dry ones some flew in the sky

415
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:49,809
this is like this is like somebody's backyard this looks like pine trees back here this is

416
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:57,019
somebody's backyard that these were these these wouldn't exist they're like a regular ass pine

417
00:45:57,019 --> 00:46:14,030
tree exists like a hundred million years ago grass didn't exist no but i mean like a like a regular

418
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:21,869
like backyard pine tree i did they with i don't think they existed it was like weird alien stuff

419
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:33,619
it was big like tropical plants but did they exist weren't they they have like the huge leaves

420
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,760
all the jurassic plants were like gigantic lettuce leaves i don't think they were just

421
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:55,500
like maple trees hanging out where did they go well we don't know but some people think comets

422
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:17,840
like sad quite a way to end the uh presentation all right namosaurus find the brontosaurus

423
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:23,820
easy brontosaurus long neck keep looking this is the brachiosaurus

424
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,739
that's bullshit because you can't see the whole body tyrannosaurus is this one

425
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:52,900
keep looking this is the this is t-rex that one you're right way too dank i'll turn it down

426
00:47:52,900 --> 00:48:05,039
i don't want to find any of these anymore all right hold on what about this one oh shit okay

427
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:18,480
that hurts my head hold on a second so this one we have to we can go away pretty much anywhere we

428
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,679
want 2 000 wait all right let's see if there's any pine trees 100 million years ago brachiosaurus

429
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:38,099
what was like a million years ago i'm a genius million bc what about like do they have like

430
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:53,199
what do we know was here 2000 1922 to 1925 and we'll do a hundred million miles or something

431
00:48:53,199 --> 00:49:08,159
100 miles oh pine tree lore yeah we gotta find out what the first pine tree was planted

432
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:26,929
there you go 100 million bc is that a but that's not a pine is it a pine tree pine trees some of

433
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:33,599
the earliest versions of trees pine trees came before but doesn't that seem odd though i can't

434
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:39,139
imagine like a tyrannosaurus rex just walking around a bunch of pine trees that feels weird

435
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:50,139
doesn't it don't you like imagine just like a like a baseball diamond near them too

436
00:49:50,940 --> 00:50:01,519
like at some old like town park like this feels like a weird image like this is just oh yeah

437
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:17,250
they're just flying around like back there american education pine trees were the first types of no

441
00:50:52,239 --> 00:51:00,400
it happen okay in this illustration you can follow what might be the history of life on earth in the

442
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,760
sky you see the development of galaxies similar to the milky way there are the comets planets and

443
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,860
moons that formed in the solar system and the rays of our star the sun send us the energy that

444
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:18,780
life depends on in the ocean at the far left the molecules that were the original building blocks

445
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:23,500
of life are forming as you look to the right you can see the bacteria that were the first cells

446
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:30,349
of life followed by more sophisticated sea life amphibians were able to how they know this how do

538
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:24,909
i don't really have a time load i'm just messing around all right this one's big damn this one's

539
01:23:24,909 --> 01:23:37,409
like 400 megabytes games that big back then when did this come out 400 megabytes 1995

540
01:23:38,369 --> 01:23:51,420
that seems huge for 1995 that's massive 3d movie maker came out in 1995 and i don't think that was

541
01:23:51,420 --> 01:24:00,020
more than that was a big one too i think that was like 100 megabytes maybe less diablo 2 was

542
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:14,369
one gig it really was all right here we go what's my laundry routine i filled the bathtub with water

543
01:24:14,369 --> 01:24:19,329

544
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:26,449
and then i take it all out and put it outside and lay it on the ground in individual pieces

545
01:24:26,449 --> 01:24:46,850
and it dries in like a day or so will you walk can i unask that question no you can't damn this

555
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:22,619
driving ceo of the a4 group stock markets in paris london new york and tokyo reacted to the

556
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:29,149
news by driving down the value of a4 stock trading of a4 shares was halted in london and

557
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:36,850
this is my company as prices declined 18 percent in a matter of hours transacting printer on a

558
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:45,409
worldwide scale a4 has risen classified documents tokyo paris berlin rome london dominating such

559
01:27:45,409 --> 01:27:53,090
diverse fields as silicon chip manufacturing telecommunications and agro technology our

560
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:57,250
latest i don't think you want to put those on your desktop the phone from betola hello steve

561
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:04,340
in 1974 marotta the japanese president of the a4 group disappeared from his private yacht in the

562
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:11,220
seas off bermuda this evening his successor dwight owen barnes is still missing his plane made its

563
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:15,859
last contact with the toronto control tower at about eight o'clock last night while flying over

564
01:28:15,859 --> 01:28:21,779
the town of totovo 50 kilometers from the serbian border the scotchi government says it has no

565
01:28:21,779 --> 01:28:26,020
information about the disappearance of the businessman's jet and has sent several rescue

566
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:30,659
teams to the area the extreme tension in the balkans together with the bad weather conditions

567
01:28:30,659 --> 01:28:35,460
which have hit this mountain area for the last week is making the search extremely difficult

568
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:42,079
i wonder i want to see what's in like these classified files at first light okay nearly

569
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:50,079
25 years ago dwight owen barnes grasped control of the then modest 10 billion dollar a4 group

570
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:55,920
turn it into today's 100 billion dollar multinational conglomerate what do we do barnes

571
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:01,039
disappearance creates a vacuum in the executive ranks of one of the world's largest and most

572
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:08,000
visible what do we sell three former ceos have also departed in an equally abrupt and mysterious

573
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,560
fashion perhaps even more uncommon is the fact that within a short period a new ceo has been

574
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:20,560
named to head a four a complete unknown from outside the organization or from just watching

575
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:27,760
the news corporate entity for that matter then a4 usually follows a series of management reversals

576
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:33,439
resulting in international market shifts of global proportions out of which the company

577
01:29:35,979 --> 01:29:41,020
cnn will monitor world financial markets and provide updates as more information becomes

578
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:44,779
why do i have access to this guy's computer via cnn online

579
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:55,279
video message is waiting there is still one here it comes starts playing cartoon network

580
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:09,890
it just goes like teen titans i'm gonna get another call another video so you would like

581
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:18,109
to sit in the chair of power well i'm going to give you that chance it's fucking like the jimmy

582
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:29,020
world has learned of my absence and may soon learn of my successor it amuses me to hear the

583
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:36,979
pundits speculating about the circumstances of our succession policy it gets some better lighting

584
01:30:36,979 --> 01:30:44,619
your fucking office sucks at a4 we trust in the element of surprise imagine any other company

585
01:30:44,619 --> 01:30:50,060
stepping outside their cozy network of corporate sycophants and placing a rank amateur at the top

586
01:30:50,699 --> 01:30:56,939
so your plane didn't pay for his dividend from such timid corporate myopia is the factor of

587
01:30:56,939 --> 01:31:02,539
complete predictability you see by the time our competitors clones root their way to the front

588
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:09,659
of the trough we can anticipate their every move we know every corporate report they've ever

589
01:31:09,659 --> 01:31:16,939
published every guru they've ever quoted and everyone they've ever you see we got my son's

590
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:21,579
math homework book and we're gonna try to find out what how to do long division today

591
01:31:22,619 --> 01:31:28,300
that's like a little that's like a fucking eighth grade notebook with fresh rot an individual who

592
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:34,270
possesses genetic instinct and vision to shock the competition that's how we stay on the cutting

593
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:45,619
edge so what am i supposed to do 25 years ago i was that individual he set this camera up he's

594
01:31:45,619 --> 01:31:51,250
sitting here alone even i may have become too predictable so we've devised how many takes do

595
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:56,850
you think it took you who have taken the i'm just waiting for the fuck to address our initiative

596
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:03,090
fuck the following simulation three two one world of the a4 simulation he's probably fucked up a

597
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:11,439
thousand times you're ready to sit in this chair i will hand you the reins with my blessing as for

598
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:20,380
my mysterious disappearance a classic red herring and a bit of coincidental timing i find myself in

599
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:27,550
a position where's he gonna go i must drive down the value of a4 so one of our best hackers

600
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:33,149
recently uncovered a shark in the water in the form of the head of our agro genetics operation

601
01:32:34,189 --> 01:32:40,109
he and his confederates have been this laptop into offshore holding companies to cloak the

602
01:32:40,109 --> 01:32:45,949
fact that they've been amassing shares of a4 in preparations for an unfriendly takeover

603
01:32:45,949 --> 01:32:51,229
that laptop is built into the deal with the euro bank group using these shares as collateral to

604
01:32:51,229 --> 01:32:54,989
fund a final blitz which would do i'm getting up and getting a coffee in the middle of this

746
02:06:37,539 --> 02:06:44,579
magic land and strawberry well i really don't know why not everyone has a name that fits him

747
02:06:44,579 --> 02:06:52,020
what you're probably asking what i'm doing here well in magic land where all the magic in the

748
02:06:52,020 --> 02:07:00,979
world is made we work very hard making magic is not at all a simple task you know that and so

749
02:07:00,979 --> 02:07:07,699
from time to time when i get tired i sneak out to the secret tunnel and come here for a rest

750
02:07:08,979 --> 02:07:16,109
okay well what can do i tire so easily

751
02:07:16,109 --> 02:07:18,510
me

752
02:07:20,739 --> 02:07:26,899
strawberry was she confused that her robbery magic was she confused that her name was strawberry she's

753
02:07:26,899 --> 02:07:33,220
like oh sometimes your name doesn't make any sense you're a strawberry it makes perfect sense

754
02:07:33,220 --> 02:07:45,920
i can't explain why they call me strawberry oh that was a joke and while lazy strawberry fell

755
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:51,199
into a deep sleep under the tree a group of children sat in their classroom working on their

756
02:07:51,199 --> 02:08:04,539

he's a muggle i'm sorry i didn't meet himself oh my god what's the connection

761
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:24,739
between your being sad and the raindrops falling out of your eyes when children are sad tears

762
02:09:24,739 --> 02:09:31,060
fall from their eyes and i'm sad because i have to put on a magician's show at the class party

978
02:45:01,569 --> 02:45:21,620
is it nectar or is it lsd all right there's another way we can go all right we go we went

987

988
02:46:46,930 --> 02:46:54,770
their rest she opens the egg and immediately forgets the chicks color what does a matching game i really

989

magic land so listen very carefully the cost of shipping these packages is very high

1111
03:13:51,739 --> 03:13:58,299
so we have to stuff as many of them into crates as we can without leaving any empty space the

1112
03:13:58,299 --> 03:14:04,700
packages coming off the conveyor belt are of different sizes so it is possible to fit every

1113
03:14:04,700 --> 03:14:10,620
box into an empty space until the crate is completely full you can start now

1114
03:14:10,620 --> 03:14:30,180

i actually really have ever done is that card one goodbye but like unlock card like dungeon one

1143
03:20:30,190 --> 03:20:43,149
that was unbelievably bad unbelievable that was the worst thing i've ever done the my camera was

1144
03:20:43,149 --> 03:20:49,889
too low quality you couldn't even read the cards you physically couldn't even see what was going

1145

on i thought that was gonna be way more fun fortnight tournament was not fortnight was fun

1146

1210
03:31:06,909 --> 03:31:13,549
divided up between the two of them each of you could enable pvp invasions in the game if you

1211
03:31:13,629 --> 03:31:19,629
give them a piece of fruit they'll sugar coat it for you with their own special magic coating

i have a cherry right here fresh here of a cherry and really would like you to

1213
03:31:27,010 --> 03:31:32,940
coat it with your world renowned ha ha ha elden ring i'm gonna sneeze strawberry do you remember

1214
03:31:32,940 --> 03:31:38,750
that we ordered strawberries from the vegetable vendor we ordered strawberries from the vegetable

1215
03:31:38,750 --> 03:31:49,309
vendor and you hid inside the box you hid inside the box and then when we poured the strawberries

1216
03:31:49,309 --> 03:31:58,899
into the pot yeah the pot when you were inside you gobbled everything up and didn't leave anything

1217
03:31:58,899 --> 03:32:14,340
for anyone else not even a drop that sounds like joey joey and louie let me be careful those two

1218
03:32:14,340 --> 03:32:20,020
never reveal to anyone what they put in the pot in order to make the sugar coating i don't believe

1219
03:32:20,020 --> 03:32:27,940
them they won't tell you listen to me they will tell you what ingredient is needed but not where

1220
03:32:27,940 --> 03:32:34,739
it is they will even confuse you on purpose do the exact opposite of what they ask

1221
03:32:42,430 --> 03:32:52,219
the big magic wand magic wand you can be sure you have been shown the secret of the coating

1222
03:32:52,219 --> 03:33:01,520
will never be known one two three eight nine ten now you have to start again what you said the big

1223
03:33:01,520 --> 03:33:13,420
magic wand that is outside the cupboard into the pot small magic wand right here right now we fooled

1224
03:33:13,420 --> 03:33:17,979
him we fooled him what are you talking about they said didn't they say that they it's the opposite

1225
03:33:19,579 --> 03:33:25,659
now you have to start just shove them over and just take the fucking pot which is under the table

1226
03:33:26,620 --> 03:33:30,209
put the big magic wand which is under the table i thought you supposed to do the opposite

1227
03:33:31,969 --> 03:33:36,690
so the big magic wand that's on top of the table so it's the small magic wand that's on top of the

1228
03:33:36,690 --> 03:33:51,180
table it's the opposite this is marvelous ronnie we didn't let those two showoffs get the better

1234
03:34:46,000 --> 03:35:03,149
into the pot what for him he's discovered the secret i got it put the big jar of honey that

1235
03:35:03,149 --> 03:35:08,979

1746
05:08:53,040 --> 05:09:09,700
front of the box but i'm missing a piece it's not a casket it's a box why am i saying casket

1747
05:09:09,700 --> 05:09:15,840
who said i didn't say casket i i swear to god i didn't say somebody in chat did that's why

1748
05:09:15,840 --> 05:09:25,599
i said it strawberry i still can't get out of here strawberry i still can't get out of here

1749
05:09:29,040 --> 05:09:45,900
i can't click these oh i got it strawberry you amaze me more with every passing second

1750
05:09:45,900 --> 05:09:51,340
i'm beginning to believe that the little red sweet strawberries have magic talents still

1751
05:09:51,340 --> 05:09:58,700
undeveloped of course but still worthy of admiration oh i'm so hungry i was in the box for such a long

1752
05:09:58,779 --> 05:10:04,779
time the let's play open if you get something to eat oh how about a magical lollipop we

1753
05:10:04,779 --> 05:10:18,819
strawberries are red and sweet try to eat sir i i only eat special dishes very special even

1754
05:10:18,819 --> 05:10:28,610
exceptional is that salmon or a hamburger or what do you eat what do you want in my wall

1755
05:10:28,610 --> 05:10:32,450
it's four different colors and then i will eat the hamburger that pops out of the fridge

1756
05:10:32,450 --> 05:10:48,400
this is the pantry go in there okay wait he eats strawberries this is a big plan for me to get

1757
05:10:48,400 --> 05:11:26,299
beaten what the hell is that jesus yeah sheesh sheesh the heck was that strawberry all of the dishes

1758
05:11:26,299 --> 05:11:34,860
here look very ordinary and the magician wants the most exceptional food here help me there are four

1759
05:11:34,860 --> 05:11:40,060
kinds of food on each shelf one of them does not belong to the group and is therefore exceptional

1760
05:11:40,060 --> 05:11:44,860
okay so i have to find it out of there and put it on the top shelf that wants a weird dish he

1761
05:11:44,860 --> 05:11:54,619
wants okay so what doesn't belong here you want a cake um that's right cake is the exception

1762
05:11:54,619 --> 05:11:59,340
since it is a baked product not like grapes the pear and the apple which are fruit

1763
05:12:00,619 --> 05:12:09,180
it's why i picked it thanks for the input all right this is chocolate loaf of bread candy and

1764
05:12:09,500 --> 05:12:16,290
it's a loaf of bread doesn't belong it's not candy that's right bread is the exception since

1765
05:12:16,290 --> 05:12:25,060
it is a baked product not like ice cream chocolate and candy which are sweets make me a cake sandwich

1766
05:12:26,020 --> 05:12:38,189
i don't know what is this milk a donut that's right donut is the exception since it is a bakery

1767
05:12:38,189 --> 05:12:47,659
product and not like yogurt milk and cheese which are milk products okay so we have carrot

1768
05:12:47,659 --> 05:12:55,279
see these all look like it's a bit of banana because it's a fruit that's right banana is

1769
05:12:55,279 --> 05:13:00,720
the exception because it is a fruit and the tomato the carrot and the cucumber are all

1770
05:13:00,720 --> 05:13:10,369
vegetables this guy's deficient in a lot of stuff okay so i did it cake is not the exception since

1771
05:13:10,369 --> 05:13:23,970
it is a baked product like bread what the fuck are you talking about that's right the banana

1772
05:13:23,970 --> 05:13:30,610
is the exception since it is a fruit and all the others are bakery products i don't believe this

1773
05:13:30,610 --> 05:13:38,770
all he wanted to eat was a banana why didn't he just tell us he wanted a banana oh i like this guy

1774
05:13:38,770 --> 05:13:42,930
i know

1775
05:13:56,319 --> 05:14:20,299
right all these banana haters bring me the exceptional dish here this is just what i

1776
05:14:20,299 --> 05:14:26,380
wanted to eat you know now that i've calmed down a little i can tell you the magic didn't work

1777
05:14:26,380 --> 05:14:31,900
perhaps because whenever i do something really big and important i have to put on my great

1778
05:14:31,900 --> 05:14:37,740
magician's hat got it unfortunately that has disappeared someone who wanted to be as great

1779
05:14:37,740 --> 05:14:43,340
as i stole it from me i'm sure that it was one of the pupils in the magician's school oh well

1780
05:14:43,340 --> 05:14:48,779
never mind the police are taking care of the matter and i forgot there are police in the universe

1781
05:14:48,779 --> 05:14:54,459
listen strawberry take this note and bring me some vegetables from the magic vegetable garden

1782
05:14:54,459 --> 05:15:00,299

1783
05:15:00,299 --> 05:15:06,060
from the garden and help me find my hat maybe i'll be able to help you get a little closer to the

hey we'll see how the mirror starts behaving badly towards me go away enough is enough

1818
05:21:13,069 --> 05:21:17,630
hardly a minute goes by when she changes what she's wearing and then she comes and looks at me

1819
05:21:18,270 --> 05:21:24,270
don't you think this is a little too much you don't well this time i won't let you look into me

why should it work all day no drip i really like this you see well

1822
05:21:48,479 --> 05:21:58,619

1823
05:21:58,619 --> 05:22:03,860
and the minute you see that it's right the mirror is scared to death of hammers

1824
05:22:03,860 --> 05:22:06,580

so it's a good thing you've come to me all the items in this room can put together the magic

1883
05:31:53,020 --> 05:31:59,500
to release an item however in order to know what items are needed for the pink turnip

1884
05:31:59,500 --> 05:32:05,500
i have to close my eyes and dream the items will soon appear in my dream

1885
05:32:05,659 --> 05:32:12,299
you can help me by looking into my dream and try to remember the items that appeared in it

1886
05:32:13,259 --> 05:32:20,939
then bring them to me from the cubby holes on the wall this must be the dream i've been sitting on

1887
05:32:20,939 --> 05:32:25,340
my balls for a long time and i just realized it if you get that if you figure that out

1888
05:32:26,540 --> 05:32:29,840
like i've been sitting on my balls and like i just figured it out right now

1889
05:32:30,000 --> 05:32:39,950
figure it out right now what was it i i wasn't paying any attention

1890
05:32:40,590 --> 05:32:58,740
i didn't get a single piece of it i didn't pay attention at all dude what what you what

1892
05:33:25,229 --> 05:33:38,400

1893
05:33:38,959 --> 05:33:58,779
you got it one more window that's it so what the hell now that we have created the magic

1894
05:33:58,779 --> 05:34:11,139
we have to make it work on the turnip here strawberry the trick has succeeded the magic

1895
05:34:11,139 --> 05:34:21,090
item is coming out thank you very much it looks kind of rotten in the middle aren't you supposed

1896
05:34:21,090 --> 05:34:45,119
to be an elden ring streamer sometimes we break it up with a little bit of variety he's so scary

1897
05:34:46,259 --> 05:34:55,340
why i would what did i do what do you mean he's so scary i didn't do i didn't do anything since

1899
05:35:01,790 --> 05:35:09,139

1906
05:36:36,959 --> 05:36:44,509
all right it's a mature audience stream you had to click the thing

1907
05:36:45,310 --> 05:36:56,240
we might be playing a game for seven-year-olds but it's uh it's a mature stream all right put

1908
05:36:56,240 --> 05:37:05,419
the disc in let's go work is magic and magic's work too this is well known to me and to you

1909
05:37:07,439 --> 05:37:17,150
hmm the door has opened let's go hmm i'll just finish end game and we'll fly over the deep dark pit

1910
05:37:18,270 --> 05:37:34,799

1911
05:37:37,119 --> 05:37:41,860
in like a year and a half now i've said that like a bunch of times i'm just gonna lie but it's not

1912
05:37:41,860 --> 05:37:55,580
okay the door to the cave is closed i'll go and take a closer look nice this is it

1913
05:37:56,619 --> 05:38:04,720
this is it this is the end here this is the end firefly fairy lives in the dark she doesn't like

1914
05:38:04,720 --> 05:38:10,319
the light only special magic will open the cave what do you think i got in my pocket right here

1915
05:38:11,279 --> 05:38:12,720
ice bingo

1916
05:38:19,439 --> 05:38:23,439
are you guys ready we're gonna see the end of the game and discover the fairy's secret

1917
05:38:24,400 --> 05:38:34,610
how many days have gone by since i've been here my parents have to be looking for me

1918
05:38:34,610 --> 05:38:40,849
the fairy doesn't like the light and doesn't like visitors that's why she hides but when a

1919
05:38:40,930 --> 05:38:46,689
visitor does come she comes out disguised as a firefly and she always has some real

1920
05:38:46,689 --> 05:38:52,770
fireflies around her to light up the cave the secret is that the fairy's light is not

1921
05:38:52,770 --> 05:39:01,490
steady and as soon as she comes out it blinks for a few seconds pay careful attention ronnie

1922
05:39:01,490 --> 05:39:06,610
when the group of fireflies come out you have to direct your attention to the one whose light

1923
05:39:06,610 --> 05:39:11,250
blinks you must then follow her and catch her if you succeed

1924
05:39:14,049 --> 05:39:40,299
slave radigan's theme that one's blinking here she is appearing before my very eyes

1925
05:39:41,099 --> 05:39:53,650
how beautiful regal she is oh god oh brave ronnie i'm so pleased that you tried so hard to meet me

1944
05:42:28,659 --> 05:42:40,000
the birth canal every game with a complicated ending is always like oh you're gonna wake up

1945
05:42:40,000 --> 05:43:02,060
you can open your eyes you're gonna be coming out of the birth canal why is he so weird it's not

1946
05:43:02,060 --> 05:43:08,830
i'm just i an elden ring oh at the end of the game yeah you're gonna wake up it's gonna be

1947
05:43:08,830 --> 05:43:12,830

1948
05:43:12,830 --> 05:43:24,060
that's the joke i'm not speaking to that joke anymore he's high he's high as fuck i'm not

1949
05:43:24,060 --> 05:43:39,409

1950
05:43:39,409 --> 05:43:52,299
times tonight i feel like i have one of these days i'm gonna play a game i'm telling you it's

1951
05:43:52,299 --> 05:43:59,139
gonna be an elaborate big elaborate ending and it's gonna be being like reborn or something

1952
05:44:10,000 --> 05:44:14,959
you've never done the birth canal yes i have oh my god you're out of your mind i do it every

1953
05:44:14,959 --> 05:44:23,389
other game your will to find the magic was strong enough to let you succeed in the difficult tasks

1954
05:44:23,389 --> 05:44:28,029
you were given i can reveal to you the real secret of magic

1955
05:44:35,169 --> 05:44:41,729
listen to me ronnie and i can tell you that i know you are runny yes you did find magic but

1956
05:44:41,729 --> 05:44:47,490
that is just a magic trick it is an illusion where the audience thinks that you have performed magic

1957
05:44:47,490 --> 05:44:54,459
when really you have only been quick with your hands this is what rabbit owner the magician did

1958
05:44:55,020 --> 05:45:00,459
but what he does is not real magic the secret of real magic is in this book

1959
05:45:00,459 --> 05:45:06,060
and i will reveal it to you strawberry you had better listen to although i think that

1960
05:45:06,060 --> 05:45:13,580
you already understand most of the secret as you have already seen work and commitments are the

1961
05:45:13,580 --> 05:45:20,060
magic when we want something very very much we sometimes think that what we want is magic

1962
05:45:20,060 --> 05:45:24,619
but if we work hard and keep at it we will always reach the magic

1963
05:45:26,000 --> 05:45:32,610
magic land is for this you saw for yourselves you have seen that you cannot be a good magician

1964
05:45:32,610 --> 05:45:38,369
without studying in school to gain the knowledge that will allow you to invent things

1965
05:45:40,450 --> 05:45:48,189
magic is just reading books like the train designer does every kind of work has its own

1966
05:45:48,189 --> 05:45:54,830
special magic you've seen that with the artist the carpenter the porter and the vegetables

1967
05:45:56,049 --> 05:45:59,330
vegetables and magic i agree i actually agree with that it's weird

1968
05:46:01,340 --> 05:46:04,459
you put this little tiny little seed in the ground and it fucking expands in the ground

1969
05:46:04,459 --> 05:46:12,000
into an edible thing that you cannot that someone else gave you it's a fact only she could get the

1970
05:46:12,000 --> 05:46:17,680
magic out of the turnip you brought her you most certainly learned that you cannot steal knowledge

1971
05:46:17,680 --> 05:46:28,380
and use it like the student in the magician school tried to do seeing that every goal we hope to

1972
05:46:28,380 --> 05:46:36,139
reach is magic that requires hard work you even have to work hard to gain love that's right isn't

1973
05:46:36,139 --> 05:46:42,220
it strawberry but you're just using magic as to win my daughter's love i am happy that magic land

1974
05:46:42,220 --> 05:46:48,860
was able to teach you what we already know that's just a made-up word understand how to get magic and

1975
05:46:48,860 --> 05:46:54,139
use it correctly even if you are faced with several kinds of magic that your will wants

1976
05:46:54,139 --> 05:47:01,419
to achieve be able to choose the best magic among them for you this every noun the firefly fairy

1977
05:47:01,419 --> 05:47:08,900
have to be afraid even if you think that a deep dark pit separates you from your magic when you

1978
05:47:08,900 --> 05:47:13,139
went to the carpenter and he performed magic with the hammer hitting the nail when you went to the

1979
05:47:13,220 --> 05:47:17,700
chef and he performed his magic making the food that's not how it works

1980
05:47:18,580 --> 05:47:24,819
and get it as the vegetables did and succeeded in getting their own magic remember this too

1981
05:47:25,459 --> 05:47:31,860
even when things get tough you must never take the easy and short path of stealing magic like

1982
05:47:31,860 --> 05:47:44,860
exactly what you're doing the easy path of explaining to a child with me that everything is magic all

1983
05:47:44,860 --> 05:48:01,680
magic come back home even if it is hard for you we understand make no mistake we love you and

1984
05:48:01,680 --> 05:48:11,520
will help you will be so different going back to magic land now that everybody loves me

1985
05:48:12,479 --> 05:48:20,799
i want i also want to find my real goal i find the magic but just a moment i want to say goodbye

1986
05:48:20,799 --> 05:48:32,700
to ronnie wait he knows but they always knew that you were not me and yet they helped us

1987
05:48:33,659 --> 05:48:41,330
i'm going back i'm going back energy my task is to find my magic and become the best magician in

1988
05:48:41,330 --> 05:48:50,290
the world i'm sure you'll succeed thank you for all your help i'll miss you strawberry oh

1989
05:48:51,250 --> 05:48:57,330
and fortunately for you ronnie that was a real spell you're not going anywhere

1990
05:48:57,330 --> 05:49:17,790
you're permanently a tomato i'm not going anywhere oh here we go with the talent show this is it

1991
05:49:32,110 --> 05:49:39,299
what what the fuck wait they were like living carrots in the real world isn't that kind of

1992
05:49:39,299 --> 05:49:46,540
weird no one's asking a question of like where did all these like weird like mutated fruits and

1993
05:49:46,540 --> 05:50:21,389
vegetables come from this is his heart the whole time oh shit he took too much the crowd was amazed

1994
05:50:21,389 --> 05:50:26,830
and we're all wondering where did ronnie learn such wonderful magic but only ronnie and strawberry

1995
05:50:26,830 --> 05:50:41,259
knew the real magic they learned was not the one shown on stage what does that say i'm not back at

1996
05:50:41,259 --> 05:50:52,450
the school i i'm not at the school i didn't go back home i'm in magic world still i never went

1997
05:50:52,450 --> 05:51:21,819
back home that's swedish that was i liked that a lot that was cute the real magic was magic was

1998
05:51:21,819 --> 05:51:31,810
just replaced as a verb or what a noun for hard work but then i actually like floated a thing and

1999
05:51:31,810 --> 05:51:38,419
they made a magical explosion and it floated up i would try got turned into a strawberry magic was

2000
05:51:38,419 --> 05:51:46,580
real how would i become a strawberry i'm telling you we just need to wait a few more minutes here

2001
05:51:47,650 --> 05:52:11,970
and then the birth canal ending happens you're gonna come on press enter i don't think that

2002
05:52:11,970 --> 05:52:17,310
did anything yeah it doesn't do anything now that's it i got to the end of the disk

2003
05:52:17,950 --> 05:52:38,639
there's a sequel is there actually a sequel no there's not really strawberry magic there is

2004
05:52:38,639 --> 05:52:46,689
a sequel oh i'm definitely gonna play that at some point uh i think that's probably a good time to

2005
05:52:46,689 --> 05:52:56,290
end it there's an episode two of strawberry magic i'm definitely gonna play the sequel it was 11

2006
05:52:56,290 --> 05:53:08,799
o'clock i think this is a good place to probably stop for now i actually liked that a lot that was

2007
05:53:08,799 --> 05:53:14,860
really fun some of these old games are just so weird they just need to be experienced when are

2008
05:53:14,860 --> 05:53:26,130
we gonna come out of them what about yeah tonka construction i did not realize it's not dos game

2009
05:53:26,849 --> 05:53:33,259
there's a windows 3.1 game i need a virtual machine to play it so i'm gonna need to get that set up

2010
05:53:34,459 --> 05:53:37,900
i think i could probably install windows 3.1 on dos box and get that to work

2011
05:53:39,439 --> 05:53:51,950
but it's that's not technically a dos game yeah that's it that we can end here so uh the next

2012
05:53:51,950 --> 05:54:02,340
stream we were live yesterday today well nothing tomorrow i'll be back on tuesday seems like a good
