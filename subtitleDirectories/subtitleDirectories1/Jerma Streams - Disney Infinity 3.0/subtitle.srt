1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:07,139
Disney Infinity 3.0. Those of you that don't know, I said to somebody, somebody said,

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,140
hey would you ever play Disney Infinity 3.0? And I said I would rather show my asshole on stream.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:26,170
So, I guess I would rather do this. I have no idea what this game is. I have absolutely no clue.

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:32,740
I just know that somebody said, dude play Disney Infinity 3.0. And it just hard crashed.

5
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:49,380
Disney Infinity 3.0 is not responding. Let's try that again. Disney Infinity 3.0 Gold Edition.

6
00:00:50,100 --> 00:01:02,570
Okay. Can I put, this is taking over my whole computer. It's on the, okay I have three monitors.

7
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:18,790
It's on that monitor now. Over there. Why is it on the other monitor? This game uses an auto

8
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,109
save feature. Do not power off the system while this icon is shown. Streaming videos not rated

9
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:33,219
by local rating boards. What? What does that mean? There are videos on here that have not been rated?

10
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,319
Is that what it means? Or does it mean that it's, if you're watching a stream of somebody

11
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:43,319
play this like me, that's not rated? I, you can't see it but I don't want it on this monitor.

12
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,420
I'm trying to capture the game.

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:30,259
Give me a sec. God, I can't move it. How do I move this fucking thing? Why are there no options? How

14
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:48,259
do I move this to another monitor? Shift and arrow key. Windows shift arrow key. That did not do

15
00:02:48,259 --> 00:03:04,039
anything. That ruined everything. I have, it's a mess now. It's a fucking mess. I can't move it.

16
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:19,180
I'm just gonna play it on the other monitor. It's not, the game's not even being captured either.

17
00:03:19,180 --> 00:04:02,740
So get it. So capture it. It's not gonna happen. This game was, okay they made this game for like

18
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,939
consoles and then they just, they just dragged the folder over to a CD and then they were just like,

19
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:20,220
just to do that. That's it. There's no options. I can't do anything. Alt plus enter to switch

20
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:40,600
window mode. It's not working. It can't even, okay I'm done. That was Disney Infinity 3.0.

21
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:47,100
Game can't fucking be played and streamed. It has to be played on a monitor that it chooses.

22
00:04:49,019 --> 00:05:01,019
So I'm gonna get up and show my asshole on camera. What if I, hold on, let me try this.

23
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:18,490
Yeah, we won. We win. I'm gonna try this one more time. It's on this monitor now. It's okay,

24
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:41,339
it's on the right monitor but it won't capture. Capture it. Dude, and now it's on, I'm done.

25
00:05:41,899 --> 00:06:05,189
Fuck this game. Wait, I'm, okay count to 30. I want everyone to count to 30 because in 30 seconds

26
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:09,269
I'm moving on to the next game and that was fun. I played Disney Infinity 3.0. It was a fun game.

27
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:37,750
Count to 30 seconds. It's not capturable and it's fucked up again. Yeah, fuck this game.

28
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:44,870
No, no thanks. No thanks. Fuck that stupid ass game. Okay, I'm done. That was fun. Cool.

29
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,069
I'm uninstalling it right now. Literally manage. Uninstall.
