1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:13,050
Okay, hello. Alright, so here are the options. We can start season two and do like episode one.

2
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:21,579
Or we can wait and actually dedicate a whole stream to doing like two to three episodes.

3
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:36,259
Or I open up Mordhau and now that progression actually works, be able to play and level up

4
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:45,399
and buy stuff and actually progress in that game. Those are the two options. I'm probably

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:57,289
I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm leaning towards... I'm torn because I really want to

6
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,100
level up in Mordhau just because I want to see what's in the game. And then we can save season

7
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,060
two for give it its whole stream. Give it even so I don't have to just do one episode or

8
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:23,530
one and a half episodes or something. Alright. Yeah, I think that's what's going to happen.

9
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,480
We're going to play Mordhau for a little bit and then Sam and Max season two

10
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,840
will dedicate it so we don't have to have it be one episode spread out and then two

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:51,430
episodes. I'd rather just do two or three episodes in one night. But season one concluded.

12
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:05,849
Why ask? Well, I'm just curious, you know. I mean, I'm going to do what I

13
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:12,169
feel like I would have the most fun doing right now. You know, season two would be fun,

14
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:26,060
but I'd rather dedicate it to a whole stream. I didn't put a poll up. I was just deciding.

15
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:37,960
I didn't put a poll up. What are you talking about? If I had put a poll up and left to

16
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,689
go to the bathroom and come back, then yeah, I didn't put up a poll. I was just

17
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:56,699
torn on what I was going to do. Alright, so let's change this over. Plus, I want to see

18
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:11,060
what's in that game. We didn't get a chance to see the other items. I did do a poll.

19
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:26,599
Yeah, I did the what I did. What color am I? Poll. How do you do the degree symbol?

20
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:42,789
It's like a little, it's a little O, right? Because I can't, it's fine. That's, that's,

21
00:03:42,789 --> 00:04:12,490
that does not look correct. But who cares? 360 O's. Alright, let's open it up. Alright.

22
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,850
Thank you for watching Sam and Max. It will return. We will do a, we'll properly do

23
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:35,339
season two. That's not a lie. Look, if this is going to be a Jerma lied about Sam and

24
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:41,100
Max scenario, you wouldn't have seen season one today at all. I would have been like,

25
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,100
yeah, I don't know. I don't know if I, I don't think I'm going to do it today.

26
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:59,670
I would have been like, nah, I don't think so. Maybe next week. I didn't want to

27
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:18,220
conclude it though. Alright, open. Hopefully this is not too loud. It might be lying

28
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:33,939
about Minecraft story mode. Oh shit, I was trying to mute this. Everything has to be loud

29
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:42,360
as fuck. Don't you guys know? So let's go over the, let's see what's, what's on tap here. We got

30
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:54,379
Wednesday, I want to do dreams stuff. So when you will probably, so dreams is Wednesday,

31
00:05:55,339 --> 00:06:00,759
Thursday, I got something I want to do in there. Alright, here you go. Here's the block

32
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:07,540
out for this week coming up here. So Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then probably Sunday.

33
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,199
That makes the most sense. So you'll probably, we'll do season two of Sam and Max before

34
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:19,829
we started on Friday. Dreams is coming back because I, I want to show you some things

35
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:28,069
that I've made. So like, hopefully I can get some shit to see. And if anybody else has made

36
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,670
anything, if you haven't, if nobody's done anything, then whatever. I, you're not expected

37
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:49,560
to. Alright, here we go. Now the question is, will this work? Will you work? Is progression

38
00:06:49,560 --> 00:07:04,709
functioning? Cause I really want to see what's available in the game. Okay, it does. Thank

39
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:13,560
God. Good. So let's, let's test this theory. I'm going to search for a battle Royale.

40
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:24,360
I gotta remember how to play. Don't do BR, please. Look how quick that was. That was in

41
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:35,269
seconds. He's just, he's turning into a normie streamer. No, no, I just wanted, I just wanted

42
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:46,089
to see. Yeah, last time this barely worked. Alright, I remember and this is the stab.

43
00:07:47,129 --> 00:08:04,569
This is the feign. Oh, I forgot you can kick. You can kick. What's kick? What is kick?

44
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:20,550
Oh, I remapped it. I remapped it. There it is. Fuck. Does this play better than chivalry?

45
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:29,779
Um, I, I have this weird memory of chivalry where I remember playing it a lot, but I kind

46
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:37,460
of don't. I feel like I'm having more fun in this game than I did in chivalry. Like I

47
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,940
don't remember like really that much about chivalry. It's been too long. Alright, last

48
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:51,059
time I did this, there was like 10 people in each one of these. Rock and a bandage. Oh

49
00:08:51,059 --> 00:09:03,850
god, I got a rock. Okay. Is that what all that was in there? Five ammo. I need to move. I'm like,

50
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,220
I'm freezing. There's a chest right there. There's like two chests. God damn it. I hope

51
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:19,559
they didn't. I'm surrounded by chests. Alright, I got a falchion. There's a, uh,

52
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:28,220
bear trap. I'm just gonna put it down like right next to the chest and I need a

53
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:37,769
shield or something. Shield. Okay. What is this? Light chest. Okay, it's on.

54
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,379
Ah! My, oh my god, what the fuck? That hurt so bad. I don't, that scared the shit out of me.

55
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:02,840
Why did that just scare me so much? I'm out of here. We're not doing Battle Royale.

56
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:17,080
Frontline. I'm just gonna do matchmaking. Okay, it's time for season two episode one

57
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:41,860
of Sam and Max. Finally. Come on, give me a server here. Come on. I'm trying to get

58
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:52,600
in your game. Come on, Battle Royale took like 10 seconds and the other

59
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:01,080
fun game mode is not gonna take. Come on. Maybe I should try a different region

60
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:15,450
or just go right in the browser. Uh, any game mode is fine. There are a shitload of these

61
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:28,809
servers. 39 out of 48. Oh goodness. This is gonna be a mess. There are 800,000 people

62
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:37,000
playing this right now. Are you kidding me? There are 800,000 people playing this?

63
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:54,809
That's insane. Let's just get in a game. It's 30,000. Oh, I was gonna say that's more than,

64
00:11:54,809 --> 00:12:07,750
that's more than like Dota 2. This guy's so dead. I'm the one that get hit by that.

65
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:23,059
Really? Yeah! Oh shit, I thought he was red. Oh boy, too many people.

66
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:47,539
Do-O-Mega-Lol-Ota. Fucking Omega-Lol. Why do I find that so funny?

67
00:12:49,850 --> 00:13:10,259
Yeah, I chopped off his arm, mate. All right, here we go. How do I, here we go. I want to throw it at

68
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:29,269
him. Watch out, watch out, watch out. I didn't mean to. I didn't. I promise. Damn it. I'm going

69
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:51,720
for a stab. Shit. Damn it. Oh, I stepped in the fucking fire. Spawn here. I gotta do more faking.

70
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,710
I like the fake into the stab. So you go like, I'm gonna stab. That works a lot. That's

71
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:12,490
really, really hard to defend against that. I just want to unlock a new weapon. All right,

72
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:22,220
here we go. Up here. Oh, fucking bear trap. I was so tunnel-visioned into trying to hit this guy.

73
00:14:33,720 --> 00:15:09,500
Shit. Damn it. Professional gamer. Well, not really. Oh, that's way too many. This is bad.

74
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:18,460
Really? That didn't hit him. Who even killed me? I don't even know what happened to me.

75
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:38,259
Let me change classes. How do I change classes? It was me. Oh, that was the last stand. Right,

76
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:53,029
right, right. You're right. Really? Really? What was that for? Now I have 50% of my health gone.

77
00:15:53,029 --> 00:16:16,409
He's just waiting for me to land. Watch out for this dude. He blocked it. Someone's gonna drop

78
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:39,779
down here. Come on. Thank you. Watch out for the fire. No, that's not a guy. He looked blue.

79
00:16:39,779 --> 00:17:10,009
His left side is blue. He's like two-faced. I didn't think he was gonna go straight into me.

80
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:16,569
If I don't sprint, I'll regenerate HP. Good to know. Thank you. Heal by walking,

81
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:35,430
not by sprinting. LOL. Idiot. All right, let's make something happen here.

82
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:52,279
How did that guy block that from behind? How? I don't believe it. Nope.

83
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,269
Okay, don't sprint and just stand here and heal. That is so fucking funny.

84
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:24,700
This game is, I love this game. All right, I got him right in the head.

85
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:48,740
He's behind me. Somebody behind? Oh, God. What? This guy didn't even do the tutorial.

86
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,420
What? It's really annoying when these streamers just jump into a game and they just like,

87
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,660
they just play and they don't even do the tutorial and they talk about like,

88
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,220
what the fuck? What killed me? It's like you didn't stop and heal. I don't know what

89
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,740
we're talking about, but this game is like a fucking problem with the game. It's like you

90
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,400
have to press Q to feign he's not doing that. These fucking streamers. You know what I'm

91
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:49,160
saying? Nope. You were taunting. Let's see it. Clubbed. I'm going way too far up here.

92
00:19:49,160 --> 00:20:27,019
I got to slow down. Getting too zealous. Whoa. What? That's okay. I died so fast and I spawned

93
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:36,759
so fast. I just saw myself dead on the ground. We lost. Oh well. I'm not in the last place. Yes,

94
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:45,880
I am. I thought I came in late. Come on. I'm not very good, but I still have fun.

95
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:05,400
Last place. That's what losers say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:24,539
You can't have fun while playing games. Don't you know that's the worst thing ever.

97
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:42,660
Okay. Let's go with. I don't know. Maybe. Mm. Raiders. I like Raiders. It's fun.

98
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,289
You shouldn't be laughing. This is your job. It's my job to be really good at video games.

99
00:21:47,289 --> 00:22:05,819
Come on. All right. I'm ready. I hate it when Jerma has fun. Why? Do you want me to be mad

100
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:09,019
and talk about like, I'm not just, I'm just fucking not even fun. Like this is like seriously

101
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:12,140
like fucking not even fun. It's like too hard and stupid. It's like everyone's too good at

102
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,460
the game and I fucking like it. It's like I died. We played against people that had been

103
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,539
playing for like 50 hours today. It's like not even fun. You want me to do that? No,

104
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:34,170
I'm not going to do that. I'm going to have fun. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This guy in the

105
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:42,680
corner here. I'm going to go overhead like that. Holy shit. That guy killed everybody.

106
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:55,740
Easy with that. Don't come in too hot here. Somebody behind me. Ah, shit. You have to be

107
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:36,490
monotone and serious. Fine. That what you want. Here we go. Oh, fuck. I'm laughing.

108
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:53,380
I'm not supposed to be doing that. Hey, why is do some of you do this to me? That's not

109
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,940
nice. Oh, that's a, that was a legit misclick. Okay. All right. No, no, no. That's okay.

110
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:31,380
That's fine. Fuck. Oh, I'm getting so outplayed. Fuck. Died to stick. Well,

111
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:46,220
there were four of them over there. Oh God. That's the one thing I didn't like

112
00:24:46,220 --> 00:25:13,930
about crossbows. They take too long to reload. That's the one thing I don't like.

113
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:28,549
What? What happened to my weapon? You don't even know who's here. Somebody's

114
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:43,339
coming behind you. Good job. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Chat's going to yell at me. Where's my,

115
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:58,789
where's my health? There we go. Hey, what just hurt me? Did I get sniped? Don't,

116
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:25,289
I'm trying to heal the fuck out of here. I would have had more health. Too many. Really?

117
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:56,700
That was a weird arc there. Damn it. Attention. Horses in the stables. Red team OP. The blue,

118
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,779
it's quite funny. The blue team generally team kill more due to people mistaking them for

119
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:12,819
red players when they are low health because they're blood. That's so funny. I've definitely

120
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:43,349
been guilty of that at least five to ten times. What are you doing? What? What are you doing?

121
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:55,430
That guy just ran into the wall and died, I think. He put up the wall and the guy like

122
00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:28,099
bugs-bunnied into it. That didn't hit him. Watch it. No, dude. Shit. You can't hear the game. What?

123
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:49,450
No, dude. It's really quiet. Is it? Is that better? It should be. Uh oh. Getting a little

124
00:28:49,450 --> 00:29:12,069
bit of frame dropage here. The guy playing the harmonica or whatever it was just got

125
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:35,400
crushed. I get too distracted by the funny things on screen. Let's go. Got the roof.

126
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:50,980
All right. Makes that guy swing again. This is too confusing. I'm going the other way.

127
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,759
What? Hold on. I hit that guy twice in the back and he's still alive?

128
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:27,640
Frame rate. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, he's got that perk, right. Okay.

129
00:30:38,730 --> 00:31:00,980
Fuck. Nope. No way. Get those bastards. Enemy is capturing the stables. Not good.

130
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:22,059
All right. I'm gonna go shirtless guy in here. Ready? Puck. Okay. I'm in the middle of everybody

131
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:28,759
now. They both did the same thing. I'm trying to go around the corner and like hit him in the

132
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:37,029
face. All right. I was doing okay. It wasn't like the top five and I'm dropping down.

133
00:31:37,670 --> 00:32:11,210
Let me get another couple kills here. Minus 67. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna wrap around. Watch this.

134
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,289
Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch this strategy. Never mind. There was no. Never

135
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:23,190
mind. Never mind. I was gonna wrap around that guy but he backed up too much. I thought

136
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:56,680
they're gonna fight in the tunnel together. Ooh. Oof. Should I? No. Bad idea. Hey, I'm just

137
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:12,099
trying to heal. Wait, was I blocking? I think I was blocking the whole staircase up here.

138
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:28,009
Got it. Somebody ran all the way over there. This guy doesn't know.

139
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,420
Stay out of his peripheral. I'm gonna hit him right in the head.

140
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:51,400
Damn it. Capture it. All right. Watch out for those spikes. Guy on the, on the, on the

141
00:33:51,400 --> 00:34:11,019
treachery belt. Whatever. The trebuchet. It's our trebuchet now. Oh yeah. Now we got a

142
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:31,769
string. Now we got a string. Fire. Horse. Horse. Give me the horse. What? What happened?

143
00:34:37,239 --> 00:35:10,539
Because it was in the fire? Oh. The horse died to fire and then stumbled on me. Did

144
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:34,300
that guy fall down? Is that a teammate? No. Damn it. Ooh. He went all the way around.

145
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,739
I know what you're talking about now when you say that they might, that they look

146
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:19,940
like they're red. Everybody I try to hit. What are they? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold

147
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:29,000
on. Hold on. Hold on. I mean like seriously. What? He just, it's like he's shooting rocks

148
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:45,320
over. I gotta go visit this guy. I have to get over there. Come on. That was right in

149
00:36:45,320 --> 00:37:11,780
the back of his head. I took, that was clean on the nape of his neck. Ooh. He caught that

150
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:50,539
one with his teeth. Ooh. Hey. Is that all you got mates? Oh, but it is a take to take me

151
00:37:50,539 --> 00:38:15,900
down. Seven. How many? Eight. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,

152
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,380
click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

153
00:38:21,239 --> 00:39:03,829
Really? Level two. I should be much higher than that. Come on. Oh. All right. I gotta

154
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:14,780
get the trebuchet guy again. This time I gotta take his head clean off. Oh God. Oh God.

155
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:30,619
Why are you standing there still? No, I can't play like this. He was alive.

156
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:46,900
Uh, he was probably rage typing. Definitely. Fucking idiot. Why do I have to get out of

157
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:54,409
always the losing team? Seriously? Like I have to just stop team killing. Oh my God.

158
00:39:55,050 --> 00:40:11,099
I mean, okay. Let me be fair. If you were riding in on a stallion and you were going

159
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:15,929
in for the kill and there was a free target for me just standing there and some dude just

160
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:33,369
swung and cut your horse down and you fell off. What? I can't swing it here.

161
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:58,019
That guy's so relentless. I couldn't fight him in there. Oh, wait. Right. You're right.

162
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:18,619
Right. Right. Okay. I can hold the, I can hold it in a different way. Can I? Right. Come

163
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:44,889
on. Right in the fucking head. Right in the fucking head. Oh, crossbow. The horse is OP.

164
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:59,420
Um, I, I, maybe I'm just not experienced in the game, but it's hard to control. Am I helping?

165
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:17,829
No, not really. Oh yeah. Destroying these guys right now. This one's running. Please

166
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:35,159
close the door. All right. Let's all, let's get in there. This is not, we, nobody can move.

167
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:47,820
No, no. Stop. Open the door. What have you done? I'm just gonna stop moving.

168
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:18,309
Ah, ah. Oh shit. Guys. I got it. It's okay. Don't worry. Oh fuck. Close it. Close the door.

169
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:40,059
Close the door. Close the door. What's he throwing in here? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

170
00:43:40,059 --> 00:44:00,840
No, no. Where am I? Oh shit. Oh my God. What? Oh fuck God. I was just in Super Mario

171
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:09,739
World. How did I not get hit and how did I not hit anybody? The never-ending Bowser

172
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:24,360
staircase. Can I open the gate? Nobody else fighting up here? Holy shit. Where did you come

173
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:35,739
from? He just did, did you see what he did with his hands? He just like changed hands.

174
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:58,329
He like switched hands. That was weird. That was bad. We can't just stuff in here like this.

175
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:31,510
Oh yeah. I know about Q. I use it sometimes. I know about you can, you do stab into faint

176
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:38,650
there. You can do a swing into a stab. You can Q. You can kick. You can kick into a kick.

177
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:49,659
You can swing into a swing. Dude, if you just had not walked right there, you walked right

178
00:45:49,659 --> 00:46:03,159
in front of it, I could have healed. I did the tutorial last time, but it didn't count

179
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:08,789
because the servers were down. So I would just be doing the tutorial for money. But I don't know

180
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:11,829
if you guys want to see, I could do that off stream, you know, and we really want to do

181
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:18,579
that right now. I don't even know what's going on, right? I guess it is worth it for money.

182
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:41,210
How did he die? How many more? One guy. Oh god damn it. I've seen too many episodes of TV.

183
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:50,420
Doesn't work like that. The guy on the horse always wins. I was like waiting for and prepared

184
00:46:50,420 --> 00:47:11,780
to strike him down. I've seen too many fucking episodes of TV. Okay. I've played too many

185
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:21,960
video games. I've seen too much TV. See you later. Oh, that would have been a fucking

186
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:48,699
champ moment if you ask me. How much gold? 600 gold. Finally leveling up and getting

187
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:55,050
money for playing. Nice. That wasn't the last place. That was right there in the middle.

188
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:15,699
All right, one more game and then we're gonna go spend some money. 600,

189
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:24,139
that's a lot of medieval money. Yeah, it is. This time we're gonna go,

190
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:38,730
I'll go protector this time. Why not? We have the smoke bombs, the mace, the shield.

191
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:46,219
Can two people get on the horse? That'd be funny if you could.

192
00:48:49,610 --> 00:49:03,829
Archer on horseback. Let's see how this plays out. Are we gonna go? You gotta lead the charge.

193
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:42,119
Okay, capturing. Okay, on to the camp, wherever this is. All right, watch out. Nice work. Watch

194
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:57,610
out behind you. Did that hit me? I think I got hit. No. I took it down right when he started

195
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:06,150
swinging. Derma shield spam. I'm a protector. I'm supposed to get in front and put the

196
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:19,320
shield out. Can I heal with this character too if I don't move? Yes. So it's only, it happens no

197
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:42,340
matter what. Yeah, guys. That guy's, whoo. Oh, a guy from firefight with a fucking sword.

198
00:50:42,340 --> 00:51:09,829
God damn it. Press end. What? Why is he still on the horse? We got three people smashing

199
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:56,969
him. Is that him again? No, that's our horse guy. That didn't hit him? Archer is so hard.

200
00:51:56,969 --> 00:52:23,480
If you hit it, it's hard though. Oh fuck. No, no, no, no, no. 70 damage is pretty hard. That's

201
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:34,469
only two shots to kill somebody in the head. What is a headshot? Is it dead? It's a dead shot

202
00:52:34,469 --> 00:53:34,710
is what that is. Damn. Really? I was standing still. God fuck. The little arrows. Like, okay.

203
00:53:36,579 --> 00:54:15,099
I guess I got him. Ooh, the Pankai is just out to get you. Well, whatever. Let them come.

204
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:35,139
We just got destroyed. Vote scramble. I feel like I would really love that bow.

205
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:48,789
Uh, where have we not gone? This one's cool. Don't go in the bedroom. Oh, okay. Oh,

206
00:54:48,789 --> 00:55:03,739
okay. Right, right, right. Along to the game has hats? I don't think that'll take very long.

207
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:27,400
All right, we're gonna stick with it. What are the breaks?

208
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:53,699
Is he chasing me? He's chasing me, isn't he? All right, somebody else take this. I don't want

209
00:55:53,699 --> 00:56:27,909
it. Yeah, watch out. Oh, I can see them. Is that a balloon? That's a balloon. I'm helping.

210
00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:53,500
I'm helping. I helped. Oh, that went right by his head. Hello? Let's go. Shit, I had it.

211
00:56:53,500 --> 00:57:08,500
Where's this dude? Hey, what are they? Oh, this guy's right in the head. One,

212
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:21,909
two, three. Oh, no. He knows. He knows what I'm trying to do. That guy just killed himself.

213
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:57,780
Come on. Thank you for the help. I appreciate it. I'm coming out. Why did that not run him

214
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:10,619
over at least? I blocked it. Oh, where is he? I think I'm gonna hold it up like it's a sign.

215
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:33,000
He's gonna get hit in the face. I remember my bow. He knocked my bow out of my hands.

216
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:46,780
Why is he? I didn't do that. I didn't do it. He got R1'd from above.

217
00:58:54,469 --> 00:59:02,389
Here he's running. He's running. Oh, didn't get away this time. Sorry, mates.

218
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:40,980
Oh, I blocked it. This is bad. I gotta get out of this. Uh-oh. Oh, I held up. I made it.

219
00:59:40,980 --> 01:00:08,840
I made it. I finally did it. Even for five seconds, I did it. I gotta get closer.

220
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:33,190
Damn it. That guy distracted me. Wow. Come on. Just stand up there. People throwing

221
01:00:33,190 --> 01:01:06,019
pans at him. That guy got a frying pan at him. Oh, shit. No. That guy has a lot of pans.

222
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:25,929
Oh, I thought he was gonna step back. All right. This guy's done. Headshot. Three, two, one. He

223
01:01:25,929 --> 01:01:36,820
jumped. Watch this guy right here. This guy is just like fucking taunting. Oh, no. That guy was

224
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:58,679
so dead. Speaking of dead guys. Yeah, speaking of the guys that are dead. Hey, trying to take

225
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:20,679
out my fucking... He blocked that point blank. He's still up there. Oh, he's still there.

226
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:32,809
Oh, is he still... Are these even going? What's the drop like here? Am I shooting too low?

227
01:02:39,460 --> 01:03:02,780
Get the fuck at it. Give me this thing. Oh, shit. I can throw it. All right. New plan. I'm going

228
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:24,650
to... Let's go with this guy. We got short sword, fists. All right. Let's make something

229
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:57,059
happen. Damn it. I'm so sorry. The guy with the hammer is seriously freaking me the fuck

230
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:05,619
out every time. Oh, you can throw it. Okay. Why was that just a weird like,

231
01:04:05,619 --> 01:04:33,050
wiffle ball throw? Oh, that was a full baseball swing to his face. It's another one. Oh,

232
01:04:33,050 --> 01:05:18,630
that's another one. Oh, who's doing that? Nice block. Oh, come on. Come on.

233
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:52,219
Oh, it's going crazy. Oh, my God. He's gonna die. He's gonna die. He's gonna die.

234
01:05:52,300 --> 01:06:07,610
He's gonna die. Did he die? Why did he not... The countdown. Wait, how come that's his

235
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:27,639
territory? Oh, bullshit. I was waiting for him to have the four or five seconds countdown.

236
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:50,760
Nice. Oops. I hit like four people on my team. I was like a hundred miles away.

237
01:06:52,889 --> 01:07:00,179
I reached across the Atlantic Ocean to hit that guy. They're killing their own teammates.

238
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:36,869
Oh, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Watch out. Oops. Oh, the stupid catapult

239
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:47,050
just hit me right in the head. Dude, that... I want to see a replay of that. The dude with the

240
01:07:47,050 --> 01:08:07,860
two pins. I came across. My sword was like 40 feet long. He blocked it. Nice. Come on.

241
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:22,819
I'll take the bolt on. Let's see. I'll take your fucking all on at once. I'll take your

242
01:08:22,819 --> 01:09:00,699
fucking all on. I need to heal. Heal. Heal. Heals. Somebody heal? Damn. What do I need?

243
01:09:00,699 --> 01:09:24,060
I need some more assists. I'm gonna go around the corner here. Watch this. One, two. Yes.

244
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:35,300
Uh-oh. It's pan guy. This guy with the pants. Seriously. Every time.

245
01:09:39,699 --> 01:09:42,979
Oh, everyone is getting clubbed by my weapon.

246
01:09:43,779 --> 01:10:02,069
Uh-oh. Damn it. Three pans and no armor. He just runs up and I end up just clothes lining

247
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:17,539
him every time. Sorry. I'm too busy fucking paying attention to other things in my mind.

248
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:30,069
You piece of trash. Stop killing the guys with the loots? What? Why?

249
01:10:30,869 --> 01:10:53,479
Is that like a sandwich heavy or something? How is that not... Holy shit. That guy got hit

250
01:10:53,479 --> 01:11:02,819
by five weapons. It's too hard to pay attention to some of this shit, man. Seriously. Like,

251
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:11,350
I need... I gotta focus again like I just was. I gotta go out on top here. Well, no. I'm not

252
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:40,180
stop playing, but... I was so focused. Now I'm just laughing. No, that didn't block. Damn it.

253
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:52,340
No. I'm so pumped right now. I gotta be in first. How much time is left?

254
01:11:52,420 --> 01:12:14,149
Just presented my crotch to him. Guys down here. I'm gonna wrap around and see if I can poke.

255
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:30,970
Damn it. A little too high. I still don't have that down. Again, this guy again. The guy with

256
01:12:30,970 --> 01:13:01,640
the pants. Come on. Kill him. Here he is again. The guy with the pants. Ooh, good blocks. Give me

257
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:17,720
it. Give it to me. Oh, fuck. I was gonna throw it at him. That guy is just a free...

258
01:13:18,279 --> 01:14:07,289
guy is a free kill. There he is. Oh, my shit. Come on. Throw it. Throw it at me. Oh.

259
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:44,470
I was just desperately trying to kill this guy. Oh, right in the back of the head.

260
01:14:44,470 --> 01:15:14,520
Damn. 35, 35, 14, 13, 10, 7. That would have been cool, wouldn't it? One day. One day

261
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:41,930
I'll get it. Ow. Is he dead? Oh, shit. I'm getting so into this. Did you tell us

262
01:15:41,930 --> 01:16:05,020
tonight's powerball numbers? 8, 14, 77, 6, 2, 2. I guess. Holy shit. That guy hit me right in the

263
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:21,319
head. Oh, boy. Oh, no. I think I'm gonna lose my first place here. Come on. I gotta get,

264
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:59,800
like, a couple more kills right here. Ow! What the fuck? I probably could have done it if I

265
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:09,819
wasn't being a dickhead. Oh, I really could have done that, too. If I wasn't being such a

266
01:17:09,819 --> 01:17:20,390
dumbass, I probably would have gotten another kill or two. All right, I'll make a character now.

267
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:35,579
Let's see what weapons I can unlock. All right. Armory. So, let's go down here.

268
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:48,340
What am I? What is this? Ain't gonna work. Okay, so, Archer's Camp Wanderer's Hood. Can't do

269
01:17:48,340 --> 01:18:07,340
that yet. None of these. Chain Coif. No, it's too much money. Root Smokebomb Cleaver Primary.

270
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:22,760
Okay. A little Hand Axe. I feel like I'd like that. A War Hammer. Oh, why? Yeah, I think so.

271
01:18:23,979 --> 01:18:35,000
War Hammer is so cool. I need to be level four for these. I am level four. Oh, four points.

272
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:47,050
I see. Well, let's get rid of this shit. Okay. I want to do- I think I want to do War Hammer.

273
01:18:50,180 --> 01:19:09,210
Let's try War Hammer. War Hammer and Targe is not bad. Greatsword.

274
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:27,369
Maul. Execution of Sword. Evening Star. Well, I'm gonna keep the rock. I think War Hammer,

275
01:19:27,369 --> 01:19:39,750
Targe will be all right. Utility Head? Popular Head and Gothic Head. Holy shit. Okay, that's

276
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:51,140
cool. Shaft. Hybrid Handle. Bar Handle. Let this drop a hybrid handle. Is it just cosmetic

277
01:19:51,140 --> 01:20:08,380
or does it do anything? I mean, I like that look better than this. Okay, can I upgrade the rock?

278
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:20,869
What about Chest Mail? Torso Chain Mail. That's only 480 bucks. Oh, shit. Well,

279
01:20:20,869 --> 01:20:30,359
that's okay. I can put this on. Shoulders. Basic Shoulders is 300. Yeah, put them on.

280
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:40,579
Okay. Arms. Anything for free? What do we got for perks? Fist damage? No.

281
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,680
Melee damage against structures increased. Repair effectiveness. Bloodlust. Full health on

282
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:54,489
melee kills. I mean, it's just- why would you not have that on? Passive. That's all I can do.

283
01:20:56,310 --> 01:21:14,739
Wow, your character looks good. Well, give me a break. He's got a little while. Okay.

284
01:21:14,739 --> 01:21:21,670
All right, I think that's good. I'm gonna try the War Hammer. We have to keep playing

285
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:32,890
to unlock cool stuff. All right, back in it. Please put on a helmet. No, we don't need pants.

286
01:21:33,609 --> 01:21:42,649
Not yet. All right, this is official. Five out of six. Six out of 48. Los Angeles. Mountain

287
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:48,789
Peak. This is frontline again. Team Deathmatch. Let's see, we did a lot. We'll do Deathmatch.

288
01:21:48,789 --> 01:21:54,569
We'll just do standard Deathmatch. Well, maybe not. I do like the frontline maps. So

289
01:21:54,569 --> 01:22:08,039
much fun. I'm going back in. Do I not want to show the server? It's all right. I mean,

290
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:12,039
at this point, it really wouldn't be that hard for someone to find the server I'm in.

291
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:25,590
You know, it wouldn't take very long. Okay, so this is the War Hammer. What's it swing like?

292
01:22:28,939 --> 01:22:34,760
Cool. Is there another way to hold it? I can swing it around the other way. I can do the

293
01:22:34,760 --> 01:23:08,979
claw of the hammer. I wonder what the difference would be here. God damn it! I forgot,

294
01:23:08,979 --> 01:23:29,060
because I was on the other team for so long. You just crit your teammate from behind.

295
01:23:29,619 --> 01:24:00,699
I know. I know it's fucking bad. Damn it, that didn't hit. Yeah, assuming the blunt is probably

296
01:24:00,699 --> 01:24:52,020
for better for heavy, right? All right, whatever. Boink! Oh shit. Damn. Oh god. All right,

297
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,979
so I had the hammer switched the other way. Seems like he had light armor on. I was only

298
01:24:54,979 --> 01:25:11,670
doing 20 damage. Do I have that backwards? Nobody's playing the objective. The spike

299
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:30,710
should be for armor. Yeah, I guess. I had it the other way around. Too many. Yeah,

300
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:34,810
claw to pierce, hammer to bludgeon. Yeah. I don't know why I thought the spike was

301
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:46,300
going to do more damage to it. I got peasant armor. This is a really, really fun game.

302
01:25:48,409 --> 01:26:01,380
It just, it's got, it hits all the notes. I can see you. Holy shit, your whole team's here.

303
01:26:19,239 --> 01:26:24,149
Here. I killed him with the rock. It's just not, I'm going to go the other way.

304
01:26:28,010 --> 01:27:00,199
Heal. Come on. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Is that it? We got

305
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:25,050
two more, right? Yeah, right in the face. There's a guy behind. Is this a bad guy?

306
01:27:25,689 --> 01:28:13,829
It is. What? We lost. I must've joined that one in the very end, huh? Nobody played the

307
01:28:13,829 --> 01:28:20,920
objective. Yeah. You have to play the objective on the objective map. That's right. It's not just

308
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:46,539
TDM. Oh, I like this map. Middle fighting in Warsong Gulch. That really is what it reminds me

309
01:28:46,539 --> 01:29:17,180
of. I don't want to get like across the mob. Rock kill. Can I reach? I don't think I can

310
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:35,739
reach. You can't reach it. Oh, damn it. Oh, well. Oh God. Oh God. I thought that guy was just

311
01:29:35,739 --> 01:29:59,350
swinging over and over again. I thought he was going to faint. One of them. Here we go. This

312
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:33,539
is not good. Too many of you. Come on. Pierce that armor. Kick them off. God damn it. There's

313
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:58,739
too many of you. I can't. Back it up. Use rock. 36. I feel like this is the wrong side

314
01:30:58,739 --> 01:31:12,819
again. It's got to be... Jesus. All right. Desperate times, guy. That's not working out.

315
01:31:12,819 --> 01:31:50,300
I got to go with the... back to Brigand. I'm kind of getting rolled here. Who's playing the piano?

316
01:31:50,939 --> 01:32:05,289
What? What is going on? What's this music? I thought that was a little loot.

317
01:32:05,289 --> 01:32:26,100
Not like a band in a box. All right. He's almost dead. I thought there was a guy right

318
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:49,239
here. There he is. Oh no. No. They don't even see me. Oh, come on. Oh, the guy comes

319
01:32:49,239 --> 01:33:12,090
at a fucking stage left with a horse. This is bad. This is bad. Yeah. We just got steamrolled.

320
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:30,819
Play the objective. It's hard to play the objective when the other team

321
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:48,390
kills all of your team and they're all still alive. You can't really walk out the door.

322
01:33:48,390 --> 01:34:03,960
Red always gets rolled on that map, do they? No. I'm going to get auto-picked.

323
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,640
Just TK the loot guy. I can't do that. People will be mad at me.

324
01:34:08,439 --> 01:34:30,760
I have no idea what I'm doing on here, but I'm going to do it. Is there a way I can

325
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:40,199
actually aim the sword? Oh my God. Oh, that's my first experience trying that.

326
01:34:40,199 --> 01:34:47,699
I think he took my head off. Oh, he's using the lance. That's why.

327
01:34:55,930 --> 01:35:00,250
Killed off by stage left by horse. No, I mean, I saw where he was going.

328
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:05,989
He killed me. All right. Let's go. Time to turn it back on.

329
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:40,550
Oh, come on. What the fucking horse. Stop. I need to play as the loot man.

330
01:35:41,350 --> 01:36:00,659
No, I don't like loot man. You just do this and like dance. Oh God, here he comes. I smelled him.

331
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:18,420
Dude, can we just have the door fucking open? Does this have to keep going like this?

332
01:36:29,899 --> 01:36:32,939
No one has been able to take that guy off the horse. He's been running around in a circle

333
01:36:32,939 --> 01:36:55,979
for like eight minutes. I didn't do it. You understand, that wasn't me. I may have been

334
01:36:55,979 --> 01:37:28,229
thinking it, but I didn't do it. I'm so concerned about everybody. There's somebody behind me too.

335
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:36,890
Look at how bad we're going to be. Look at the guy on the other team. We're going to be so bad

336
01:37:36,890 --> 01:38:00,760
because that guy over there has 10 kills. One guy. Smoking is all. I just got instantly killed.

337
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:04,779
All right. I got to stop looking at the guy standing still with the loots.

338
01:38:06,789 --> 01:38:13,289
They're distracting me. I'm not even looking at him. I'm going to, I'm facing the camera

339
01:38:13,289 --> 01:39:13,899
this way. Damn. I thought I was going to walk into it. Damn it. Fuck. No. Look at the kill feed.

340
01:39:16,779 --> 01:39:19,739
All right. Give me a break. Come on. Look at this shit.

341
01:39:36,859 --> 01:39:43,859
I can't. I can't. I can't. Why is he going in a circle like this?

342
01:39:44,180 --> 01:40:32,949
Oh my God. Oh, my face is itchy. No. All I can hear is the music. Oh my God.

343
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:46,020
I got to change it up for something, man. I can't even do anything. There's a dude on the team

344
01:40:46,020 --> 01:41:07,699
with 34 kills. Somebody sign that guy up. Oh my God. They were just everywhere. It's almost

345
01:41:07,699 --> 01:41:16,390
like they have a double spawn rate. Are they spawning inside of this building? I'm going to

346
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:24,310
get him when he comes around. Watch this. I'm ready for him. I told you. I ripped him out of

347
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:55,909
this fucking dimension. Who the hell is behind me? Get vehicle damage. Finally. Maybe I'll do

348
01:41:55,909 --> 01:42:15,739
something with the bow. Got to get on the objective though. That went right through his

349
01:42:15,739 --> 01:42:48,180
body. Stay on the cleaver. All right. I'm on. I'm on again. I'm turned on again.

350
01:42:48,659 --> 01:44:10,010
Oh, that's not hitting him. Oh, thanks for the shield. Can I get anybody from back here?

351
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:55,289
Probably not. There's a guy over here. No, I got a guy in the back. Do I win the prize?

352
01:44:55,289 --> 01:45:23,670
Is there? Will you leave me the fuck alone? Kill him. Please. I'm dead. All right. I guess

353
01:45:23,670 --> 01:45:42,600
I'm going to go with like Raider for a while. There's not somebody back here, right? There

354
01:45:42,600 --> 01:46:35,289
is somebody back here. Got him. I helped. All right. Heal. I took his head off. We did it. Oh,

355
01:46:35,289 --> 01:46:45,619
I thought I could get him down before he could. You really want that, don't you?

356
01:46:46,180 --> 01:47:09,319
You really want to get that, don't you? You want it so bad you can taste it. Oh,

357
01:47:09,319 --> 01:47:23,109
I was stuck on top of the horse. I didn't know that little Labo supported this game.

358
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:36,199
New to the Nintendo Labo. That was pretty sick. That was perfect. Streamer, look at the chat.

359
01:47:38,039 --> 01:48:08,939
What? What is it? All right. I'm going right up the middle here. Thanks. There's somebody behind me

360
01:48:08,939 --> 01:48:22,869
in there. No, I thought, no, it's just a cage. This guy. He finally panned me. He finally found

361
01:48:22,869 --> 01:49:20,520
me and panned me. He did it. Got it. Oh, I thought. I got it. Vehicle. Oh, my God. He

362
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:50,539
actually. Oh, hi again. Did I make my own class? I did make my own class, but I don't

363
01:49:50,539 --> 01:50:03,560
really have enough money to make a good class yet. I could do the peasant thing. I need more

364
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:09,399
armor, I think, if I want to make a class. Because I'm walking around with no pants on.

365
01:50:10,039 --> 01:50:21,609
I got that. I tapped that guy so many times. There's no way he stays alive from that.

366
01:50:23,449 --> 01:50:45,140
He's been quadruped. He's got a triple tap. They're surrounding me with pants.

367
01:50:50,949 --> 01:51:03,270
All right. I'm going to play something else to submit to the pans. I'm going to have to

368
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:43,159
become one. I'm going to get some kills here. Get away. All right. We're pushing out. Let's go.

369
01:51:43,720 --> 01:52:01,029
As a team, we can do it. Why are you over here? What the fuck is this guy doing?

370
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:50,420
Loot man gets revenge. I'm going to need one guy over here. Guy on a horse though.

371
01:52:50,420 --> 01:53:12,010
No, that's our horse. Oh, my God. They're doing like psychological warfare on me.

372
01:53:12,729 --> 01:53:46,140
No, too slow. I'm going to go back tonight. That guy has 67 fucking kills. All right. New server.

373
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:28,649
Thank you. It's not going to do anything. It's going to take 30 seconds for someone to defy

374
01:54:28,649 --> 01:55:22,180
this fucking server. I like this map though. All right. Fresh start. Let's go. Did that not

375
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:34,380
hit? I hit the flag. Ah, fire. All right. Am I going to die? Three, two, one. I'm alive.

376
01:55:35,020 --> 01:56:43,750
Are you serious? How? He's typing. Typing. Got the guy typing. Sick. Typing destroyed. I don't think

377
01:56:43,750 --> 01:57:05,289
he was typing that. I think he was typing. Hey guys, I got to go. Can you be faster than me?

378
01:57:05,289 --> 01:57:37,979
How is he still alive? I was trying to fake that. Let's see. Holy shit. Oh, right in the mouth.

379
01:57:37,979 --> 01:58:09,380
Why do they always run? Stand and fight. Oops. Whoa, too many. Why are you running?

380
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:38,100
Why are you running, dude? Loud as hell. People here. Well. Oh, come on. How?

381
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:58,569
That was no horse, was it? I thought that was a meteorite. Kick them. What did they do?

382
01:59:04,569 --> 01:59:25,210
It was a medieval meteorite. That's far too many. We all just got killed there. Five of us

383
01:59:25,210 --> 01:59:58,710
just died. Okay. Let's go this way. All right. Move, move, move, move, move, move. We can do

384
01:59:58,710 --> 02:00:23,510
it. Oh, fire. Good, good. Clear them out. Clear them out. Fuck. There's really nothing I

385
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:59,720
could do there. How long did it take? It's all right. Whatever. He's on my team. It's fine.

386
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:40,340
I didn't touch. That didn't hit. I didn't connect. That was fucking funny.

387
02:01:52,100 --> 02:02:02,550
Whoa. Well, that was okay. That's not a good idea. Back to the team. What's happening?

388
02:02:04,090 --> 02:03:12,630
Oh my God. Well. Yeah, you can ride a horse in this. It's crazy. It's very fun. Damn it. Ah,

389
02:03:12,630 --> 02:03:36,649
somebody behind me. Fuck. Got killed by Rockman. Probably. You stabbed him in the back.

390
02:03:43,819 --> 02:03:51,000
Oh, come on. Just aim the thing there and just wait and then press the button.

391
02:03:51,800 --> 02:04:29,590
You'll kill four people. Just keep loading it up. Yeah, let's do new game mode. And we're gonna,

392
02:04:29,590 --> 02:04:35,180
we're gonna bring the sample size down here a little bit instead of like 50 person servers.

393
02:04:35,739 --> 02:05:00,170
Okay. We've got four deathmatch death. We've done all frontline. This TDM.

394
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:24,260
Now hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's see what we got for team deathmatch.

395
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:40,500
Team deathmatch is fun. Do a dual server. Great screen while I'm picking a server.

396
02:05:41,380 --> 02:06:14,699
No, let's bring down the player count and do a, let's just do like some TDM. All right.

397
02:06:14,699 --> 02:06:30,970
Whatever you do, don't press tab. No, it's just enough. Oops.

398
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:34,810
I actually didn't mean to press that. I was trying to press Q.

399
02:06:34,810 --> 02:07:11,109
Fire, fire, fire. Oh, I got hit in the head. Don't touch that dial now. We're just getting

400
02:07:11,109 --> 02:07:28,539
started. There was just little congregation here of fighters. Well, I didn't want to hit

401
02:07:28,539 --> 02:08:23,130
anybody in the head accidentally. Easy. Nice. Good job. Really? Damn. Oh, I probably should

402
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:55,449
have spun it around on that guy before. That was weird. All right. Here we go. Back in the

403
02:08:55,449 --> 02:09:17,560
action. I just didn't know which way to look. Left and right. Both my blind spots.

404
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:25,210
Okay. This is just TDM. How much does the game get? I think it's 30 bucks.

405
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:31,770
25 right now. Maybe something like that. Oh my goodness. They're all over here.

406
02:09:31,770 --> 02:09:51,100
I got to pick a spot and stay there. I'm just so, I keep trying to change directions.

407
02:09:51,100 --> 02:10:23,750
This guy's walking. Is this guy role playing? Oh dear. That was a mistake.

408
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:43,399
Oh, that was a mistake. Was I enough of a bait for someone to get killed? Can I climb up

409
02:10:43,399 --> 02:10:57,319
the rocks? I'm just trying to be like the guy that runs in for this guy to stab him in the

410
02:10:57,319 --> 02:11:22,170
back. We won. I want to play like a full round. I keep joining and like did three

411
02:11:22,170 --> 02:11:41,210
minutes. It's over. Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot. No, no loot. I'll do my final

412
02:11:41,210 --> 02:12:11,189
round as a loot. Okay. Ooh, this is fun. I like this one. Oh, packet loss. That's not good.

413
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:39,819
All right. Let's go this way. No, that's bad. Let me regen. Oh, no more glass bottles of

414
02:12:39,819 --> 02:13:22,539
gasoline. Good job. Kick him off. I think he did. I think he kicked him off. Looked like

415
02:13:22,539 --> 02:13:33,260
it at least. I really, I thought he was going, I thought he was going to get blocked

416
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:39,939
by the guy in front of me. Apparently, I just got hit right in the head. I thought that he

417
02:13:39,939 --> 02:14:02,680
was going after the guy right next to me. Oh, he walked into that. It wasn't my fault.

418
02:14:08,390 --> 02:15:02,840
I'm trying to kick somebody. Let's do Raider. Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear. Not good.

419
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:21,500
It's going to be an extra kick perk. That would be nice. No, that's okay. Not good. Oh

420
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:56,600
my god. I'm just going to hang out back here. Let's go short here. No one's running

421
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:22,810
through here. Nobody else is going to run through the door, huh? No bad. No bad. How do

422
02:16:22,810 --> 02:17:02,440
you minus one from team killing? Too many. Wow. I just, I got spun around. I just can't

423
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:36,950
get anything going. No. Oh my god. I'm doing so bad right now. I need like a smaller weapon.

424
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:53,540
Give me a scoundrel. Green and yellow would be better. That's actually a good idea. He's

425
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:58,920
gone this way. I didn't block it. He was doing the same thing waiting for me.

426
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:48,059
I just have to play defensively here. Good job. Damn. I didn't think he was going to get that.

427
02:18:57,139 --> 02:19:06,569
Get him. Somebody get this guy. Oh, this is fucking Superman. We can't kill this one person.

428
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:29,700
He's just running around. I got it right in the face. Oh, at least that wasn't at the

429
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:55,540
very bottom. You haven't won a single game. Yeah, I'm one of 50 people. Is that really?

430
02:19:55,540 --> 02:20:19,690
I had like four people play Lutz the whole time. Is that my fault? I can't carry. What?

431
02:20:19,690 --> 02:20:28,260
You really think that's going to happen? The last game I had three people trying to pan me.

432
02:20:29,909 --> 02:21:01,620
I'm the variable. Like apparently I am. Watch the sides. Sneak in. Sneak a little bit in.

433
02:21:13,829 --> 02:21:23,829
Heal. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. I need to heal. This is not a good place to heal in front of everybody.

434
02:21:23,829 --> 02:21:56,069
In front of- Oh, this guy's just wildly swinging over here. Get him. This guy's- Why?

435
02:21:56,069 --> 02:22:59,579
I'm a psycho. Oh, right in the head. Come on, right in his face. No. Well, that was

436
02:22:59,579 --> 02:23:16,860
probably a bad idea. I ran into him and he just over- it's almost too long. And I just

437
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:24,469
put my mouth up. I was like, yeah, take a picture of my mouth. He's over here. He just

438
02:23:24,469 --> 02:23:41,159
hit me right in the mouth. Fuck. I didn't know that many people here. They'll kill each other.

439
02:23:41,159 --> 02:24:37,850
Good. I need to be behind. We're both just the same thing. Nice. Good work. Oops. Stick

440
02:24:37,850 --> 02:24:59,690
him. Stick him. Oh. Let's see if I can sneak in my skewer here. I'm trying to hit that

441
02:24:59,690 --> 02:25:27,850
guy. No. Shit. Guy behind. All right. I'll try to- after this map, I'm going to do a-

442
02:25:28,489 --> 02:25:41,290
try to find, like, another server. Maybe we'll do some 1v1s, maybe. I don't even know which side

443
02:25:41,290 --> 02:26:22,940
I am. Okay. Well, I helped. He just got Stooges. I could smell that one all the way, all the way

444
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:43,620
over here. I'm going down. Yep. Ah, shit. I got locked up. This game is very squelchy.

445
02:26:43,620 --> 02:27:04,500
What do you mean squelchy? Squelchy? Damn it. One in front, one behind. Not much you can do.

446
02:27:05,139 --> 02:27:15,860
Does Jax do games like this or only shooters? Jax does anything that I ask him to,

447
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:25,450
as long as he's had enough rest. Usually he's, like, seven months. Seven months of rest.

448
02:27:26,090 --> 02:27:59,110
Oh, fuck. Jax is just Jerma's competent alter-rego. That's- yeah, that's true.

449
02:27:59,110 --> 02:28:13,780
All right. Let me get him to, like, a- we'll- we'll do a little bit more. We'll do some

450
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:21,370
duels. And are there any official duel servers? Or do I have to find, like, a custom one?

451
02:28:21,930 --> 02:28:50,860
I don't think there's any official ones. Let's see. All right. We got 1v1.

452
02:28:51,500 --> 02:29:19,639
I don't want 32 people to go. Duels. US West 1v1s. That looks pretty good. All right.

453
02:29:19,639 --> 02:29:37,940
1v1s. How does one determine? Do I just pick out an opponent and we go? All right. Guy with

454
02:29:37,940 --> 02:30:09,770
the t-shirt on. All right. Do I say yes? I think we just- you just fight. Hey, get- no!

455
02:30:10,729 --> 02:30:40,520
I don't- I can't even, man. I seriously can't get over that. He just kind of ran up and started

456
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:54,700
swinging. I guess it's you and me again. Oh, boy. I'm just getting fucking killed by this dude.

457
02:30:56,870 --> 02:31:27,159
Hey, you! Oh, fuck. That was long. Shit! I was pretty much sure if I connected that.

458
02:31:27,159 --> 02:31:37,139
Like that? Ah. I don't know what to do here. This is- okay, you and me.

459
02:31:37,139 --> 02:32:20,860
It's quick. I- I've tried to flourish, but where do I go? Over here? Somebody? I need to

460
02:32:20,860 --> 02:32:32,600
get back in line. Where's the duel line? Hey, you! I guess we could fight each other. Wait,

461
02:32:32,600 --> 02:33:32,219
hold on. I gotta- I need to heal first. All right. Me and you. Ooh, good. Ooh. Uh-oh!

462
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:47,399
No! I could have pressed two. I forgot I had another sword. Okay, you two fight.

463
02:33:47,399 --> 02:33:53,219
All right. Let's go Minecraft Steve. That's exactly who this person's playing as. Like,

464
02:33:53,219 --> 02:34:10,629
this is Minecraft Steve. That's a big swing windup, too. He's dead. I need to heal.

465
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:30,489
Okie dokie. Don't do that. Not nice. Really? Okay. Well, I- this is- I was supposed to fight

466
02:34:30,489 --> 02:34:47,590
this guy right here. Did I cut his hands off? I'm so confused right now. I think I chopped up

467
02:34:47,590 --> 02:35:23,940
both that guy's hands. Ah, I thought he was gonna fake it. All right. Wait, that's- all

468
02:35:23,940 --> 02:35:27,379
right. That's not fair. He's throw- all right. You know, reset. Reset. Not fair.

469
02:35:27,379 --> 02:36:08,729
Somebody's being a dick. Somebody's being a dick. Okay, here we go. He thought I was gonna

470
02:36:08,729 --> 02:36:34,229
fake, didn't he? Mm-hmm. He thought I was gonna fake. All right, let's go. Why is everybody naked?

471
02:36:44,139 --> 02:36:55,500
Over! That was fun. Am I- no, I'm not naked. I'm just default regular character. That was a lot

472
02:36:55,500 --> 02:37:05,399
of money. 11 h- no, no, no, never mind. All right, I'm gonna do this again. I'm gonna do

473
02:37:05,399 --> 02:37:13,459
this again, but I'm gonna do, um, what am I- maybe I want to play- I don't have enough

474
02:37:13,459 --> 02:37:33,639
money to buy anything. I'll try spear. Let me see. The tutorial is gonna give you 2,500. Yeah,

475
02:37:33,639 --> 02:37:47,700
that's true. It's true. So can I- spear is obviously you want- is there a way to- because

476
02:37:47,700 --> 02:38:04,600
you don't want to swing a spear, right? It's all about stabs. Oh, fuck. He's relentless.

477
02:38:08,889 --> 02:38:14,010
Damn, all right. He just was right up in your face with the dagger. I don't really

478
02:38:14,010 --> 02:38:21,290
like the spears. It's- it almost feels like- it feels like I'm trying too hard to stab.

479
02:38:47,989 --> 02:38:55,370
Whoa! That was a little laggy. Get a halberd if you want to swing. Yeah. I don't- I can

480
02:38:55,370 --> 02:39:06,680
unlock it. It's all about spacing with the spear. Yeah, it's- I guess I just don't think

481
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:22,819
about how long it is. That's really long. Nah. Nah, I don't like it. I don't like it.

482
02:39:22,819 --> 02:40:20,180
I don't like it. Let's go raider. All right, let's do it. You and me. Ooh. All right, I'm

483
02:40:20,180 --> 02:40:34,389
gonna- my stamina is- I'm freaking out! Okay. I just got really panicky. Chamber you casual.

484
02:40:34,389 --> 02:40:55,450
I don't even know what that means. Oh, he tried to throw that at me. If you stab

485
02:40:55,450 --> 02:41:04,120
at a stab, you will chamber. Okay. I think- but we have the wrong idea here. I don't know who-

486
02:41:04,120 --> 02:41:42,520
All right, I guess I'm fighting you. No, it was you? Oh, I thought he was gonna fake.

487
02:41:47,059 --> 02:41:56,579
Ooh, nice. Damn it. Flourish. Yeah, I know how to flourish. Am I supposed to do that every

488
02:41:56,579 --> 02:42:41,610
time I want to fight somebody? Damn. I must have got him right in the good spot. Ooh,

489
02:42:41,610 --> 02:43:21,100
that would have hit me. Hello, Steve. Oh, I was gonna flourish. Ooh, that's a windup.

490
02:43:21,100 --> 02:43:51,610
The pickaxe is really cool because it has a huge windup. Ooh, chop his legs off. I haven't

491
02:43:51,610 --> 02:44:18,100
fought you, I don't think. You. Right there. A little belly poke. That's not how you hold a

492
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:40,899
sword. He's trying to blunt me. Okay, yeah, sure. Ooh, that like double pump. Nice. He does

493
02:44:40,899 --> 02:45:08,180
like- that like fake fake pump. Minecraft Steve coming in. Oops. I tried to fucking fake

494
02:45:08,180 --> 02:45:18,040
it out. Holy fuck, I didn't think that was gonna happen. You never expect somebody to

495
02:45:18,040 --> 02:45:45,020
throw their weapon. Whoa, what are you trying- what are you trying to pull here?

496
02:45:45,020 --> 02:46:00,250
Oh, pan guy. Oh, a little too close. Damn. That was fun though. Good job.

497
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:22,809
I can't play after that one. Okay, let's try this again. Let's try this again. Wrong

498
02:46:22,809 --> 02:46:33,020
thing. This thing. Damn. Oh, that's fucking dirty. That sword is awesome.

499
02:46:33,739 --> 02:47:08,629
I want to fight big guy with huge sword again. Nice. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, nope, nope,

500
02:47:08,629 --> 02:47:14,950
no, he did it to me too. Oh, did I kill him? Whenever you- somebody drops their weapon,

501
02:47:14,950 --> 02:47:20,120
they just get- it's like panic syndrome. They just get right in your face. All it takes

502
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:49,209
is one little punch. Uh, I guess I'll do you. Whoa, that was weird. Wow, he's like

503
02:47:49,209 --> 02:47:54,780
spinning. It's like he's starting over here and he ends up like over here. It's weird.

504
02:47:54,780 --> 02:48:27,799
Let's try it again. Nice. Oh, oh, that guy's- this guy's good. Damn it. Again. Oh, yay.

505
02:48:28,360 --> 02:48:53,049
Sorry, I pressed the DPI button. No, I tried to switch it. I'm trying to switch it again.

506
02:48:53,049 --> 02:49:05,670
What the fuck? Good, good, good, good, good. All right, I gotta fight this guy here. He's

507
02:49:05,670 --> 02:49:23,479
very good. He's very good. Oh, that little like- that little pump is so hard to predict.

508
02:49:39,510 --> 02:49:54,940
Damn it. Oh, not good. Hey, you wanna reset it or how you doing? You good? What the

509
02:49:54,940 --> 02:50:45,129
hell was that? Wrong thing. Oh, all right, it was a good poke. Okay. Whoa! I just opened

510
02:50:45,129 --> 02:50:52,819
the developer console. Sorry. Wait, get out of the developer console. He just like put his

511
02:50:52,819 --> 02:51:35,340
head down. He was like, oh shit. Oh, ah, I try- I was trying to block it. Do the tutorial

512
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:38,940
for money and to get better. I mean, I don't know if I could get better from the tutorial.

513
02:51:38,940 --> 02:51:43,909
I know pretty much how all the things to do in the game except for I don't really chamber

514
02:51:43,909 --> 02:52:25,989
that well. This guy's very good. That guy is phenomenal. That guy is exceptional. Did I say

515
02:52:25,989 --> 02:52:36,180
what the fuck just happened? Hold on, did I just swing and hit his- I'm so confused

516
02:52:36,180 --> 02:53:09,639
what the hell just happened. I just like hit him. I have no idea. No, I already did

517
02:53:09,639 --> 02:53:15,370
the tutorial. I mean, I know what's happening. It's not gonna help me. I did it the last

518
02:53:15,370 --> 02:53:28,840
time I streamed this game. The servers weren't on, so that's not counting. I'm so- what the

519
02:53:28,840 --> 02:53:36,120
hell is- should I start going like this? Like, should I start like dragging my hands over to

520
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:42,649
like help with the bait? Should I like put my sensitivity way up and like- is it- how-

521
02:53:42,649 --> 02:53:59,190
should I do that? I'm getting kind of fatigued. Gamer fatigue is kind of settling in here.

522
02:53:59,190 --> 02:54:15,879
It's alright. Just push- hold on, like- no, you can't. I have the DPI button as high as

523
02:54:15,879 --> 02:54:49,350
I can go. That doesn't really work that well. Damn. Alright, a couple more and then I'm

524
02:54:49,350 --> 02:55:01,450
probably gonna be done for today. Yeah, I just don't stand a chance when people are this good.

525
02:55:06,010 --> 02:55:15,450
No way. Yeah, I did promise Bard. I'm gonna play Bard one-on-one.

526
02:55:20,649 --> 02:55:27,719
Yeah, I'm tired. I'm getting- just everything's blending together. I'll play one- and plus my

527
02:55:27,719 --> 02:55:34,809
DPI is so fucking high. Remind me to rip these buttons off, by the way, and fucking

528
02:55:34,809 --> 02:55:51,450
burn them. Alright, let's go, engineer. Mom said it's my turn with the sword. Alright,

529
02:55:51,450 --> 02:56:06,569
here you go. Ready? I gotta play the song first. Alright, who- who am I fighting here?

530
02:56:06,569 --> 02:56:24,280
There's too many of you. Wait, what? I've never used this as a weapon before.

531
02:56:38,010 --> 02:56:52,790
No. Alright, last one. And then I'm gonna call it for tonight. Let's see if I can win with

532
02:56:52,790 --> 02:57:15,270
the loot. And there is no flourish with this thing. Get out of here. What the hell? Like,

533
02:57:15,270 --> 02:57:34,600
I was going under the fucking bottom rope of the wrestling ring. I'm gonna die. Alright,

534
02:57:34,600 --> 02:57:43,420
I'm done. I'm done. I'm outta here. I can't do it anymore. Yeah, like perfect timing.

535
02:57:43,420 --> 02:57:55,500
That was good. You know, I wanna see people- the guy with the execution of his sword guy.

536
02:57:56,139 --> 02:58:01,129
I wanna see two guys like that fight each other. I feel like that'd be really,

537
02:58:01,129 --> 02:58:14,489
really cool to watch. That guy was like in another league. Let me get a-

538
02:58:14,489 --> 02:58:19,610
This game's really, really fun, though. I know I'm kind of just being like a silent

539
02:58:19,610 --> 02:58:31,430
try-hard sometimes during this stream, but it's fun. Alright, last one. Actual last one.

540
02:58:31,829 --> 02:59:23,190
That was fun. That game's so fun. But yeah, that's gonna be it. So I will see you guys.

541
02:59:23,190 --> 02:59:28,809
Thanks for watching Sam and Max and the kind of part two of the stream, which was

542
02:59:29,370 --> 02:59:34,680
dicking around on Mordhau again. If you got into play some of those duels,

543
02:59:35,399 --> 02:59:39,819
thanks for playing. Some of you guys are really fucking good. I mean, that's really

544
02:59:39,819 --> 02:59:51,899
cool to see. Keep playing and keep kicking ass. So you will see me on my return

545
02:59:52,459 --> 02:59:59,899
What was part one? We did Sam and Max season one finale. So you will see me again on Wednesday

546
02:59:59,899 --> 03:00:07,260
because Dreams- Dreams is gonna be on Wednesday. I'm gonna bring you guys a couple of things,

547
03:00:07,260 --> 03:00:14,680
hopefully, that I've been able to make. And if anybody else has anything made,

548
03:00:15,479 --> 03:00:20,010
we can go through it as well. If they have, doesn't matter what it is. We'll just kind of

549
03:00:20,010 --> 03:00:26,170
chill and play it. And then after that, I might move on to something else for PlayStation

550
03:00:26,170 --> 03:00:30,899
4.2 because we're gonna have the PS4 plugged in. So if we do that for like an hour or two,

551
03:00:30,899 --> 03:00:36,860
couple hours of showing stuff off, maybe we'll hop in something else and play flick, you know,

552
03:00:37,879 --> 03:00:42,700
because I do like to, unless it's a big event or something, I like most streams to go

553
03:00:42,700 --> 03:00:50,739
at least, you know, five and a half to six and a half hours. But thanks for watching.

554
03:00:50,739 --> 03:01:05,959
I'll see you guys soon on Wednesday to be exact. There's a guide for Mordhau. Yeah,

555
03:01:05,959 --> 03:01:10,059
I don't know. I might keep playing. I'm not sure how much more I'll stream it,

556
03:01:10,059 --> 03:01:18,620
but I think I'm gonna keep playing because it is just scratching a FPS, goofy, interesting

557
03:01:18,620 --> 03:01:25,159
itch. So we'll see. I know I have like a ceiling of how good I can probably get in the game like

558
03:01:25,159 --> 03:01:33,219
this. So if I ever do, you know, get to a decent level, which I don't know, this is

559
03:01:33,219 --> 03:01:42,069
somebody first person swinger. Yeah. But it is a damn fun game. I highly recommend it.

560
03:01:42,790 --> 03:01:54,969
So with that, we'll move on to the bits. Let's see here. There it is. So let's go back to about

561
03:01:54,969 --> 03:02:00,899
five and a half, six hours ago here. The skill ceiling in the game is huge. But honestly,

562
03:02:00,899 --> 03:02:12,459
you're doing great. You probably could get much better. Maybe, I don't know. Possibly. It's

563
03:02:12,459 --> 03:02:17,100
really cool to see the people that are just already finding all the interesting things to

564
03:02:17,100 --> 03:02:32,649
do. And it's the fainting that's just so interesting to me. It's a blast. Even though

565
03:02:32,649 --> 03:02:37,979
a lot of times I kind of get my ass kicked, it's still a lot of fun. But Smelly Boy,

566
03:02:37,979 --> 03:02:42,059
thanks for the 250 earlier. Just want to say thank you so much for being there when I have

567
03:02:42,059 --> 03:02:45,899
a shitty week. Some days are really rough and it helps so much to stand outside your house at

568
03:02:45,899 --> 03:02:57,290
2 13 a.m. every morning until 2 16 a.m. That's terrifying. Thank you Smelly Boy for the

569
03:02:57,290 --> 03:03:06,899
scariest bit message I have ever received. Because that is so specific. That's very

570
03:03:07,700 --> 03:03:12,040
Thanks for the 250.

571
03:03:18,520 --> 03:03:22,760
Yeah, I came in and changed it. I woke up this morning and I was like, I feel like

572
03:03:22,760 --> 03:03:27,239
not that great. But I feel, I knew that by the afternoon I was going to feel better. So

573
03:03:27,799 --> 03:03:30,760
and I did so I didn't want to obviously and I did say that we were going to do five days

574
03:03:30,760 --> 03:03:45,370
this week. And we did. So I did want to make sure that I adhered to that. Got to be a

575
03:03:45,370 --> 03:03:51,459
Vaude Boy. This is a pretty, this is a pretty good stream. This has been a pretty good

576
03:03:51,459 --> 03:03:56,440
roller coaster weekend. Don't you think? You know, we went up the, we went up the chain

577
03:03:57,319 --> 03:04:01,799
in the first part of Labo. We got to the peak. I got drunk and said a few swears.

578
03:04:02,600 --> 03:04:08,100
Just a few. And then we went down the roller coaster with the Labo drunk wine stream. And

579
03:04:08,100 --> 03:04:18,100
then, hey look, we pulled into the breaks for Sam and Max. A few. What was the name of the

580
03:04:18,100 --> 03:04:34,309
bacteria? It was Roy G. Biv. Mr. Bliss, Hugh Bliss. But yeah, thank you Frodeo. I'll see you on

581
03:04:34,309 --> 03:04:38,790
Wednesday. If you'll be there. D Flyers, thanks for the five dollars. D Flyers, if you

582
03:04:38,790 --> 03:04:42,389
enjoy point and click adventure games, you should play the Submachine series of games.

583
03:04:42,389 --> 03:04:45,989
They have really good atmosphere and lore as well as being free to play in standard

584
03:04:45,989 --> 03:04:53,620
definition. Or you can buy the HD versions. Speaking of Sam and Max, what is this?

585
03:04:55,500 --> 03:05:08,600
Oh, the Max head. That is a perfect, that's perfect. Submachine. I do love point and click

586
03:05:08,600 --> 03:05:17,100
adventure games. Especially the odd ones. I remember we played Harvester. That was a journey.

587
03:05:17,899 --> 03:05:29,000
Sam and Max is cool too. When was the last time I got a sunburn? I got a little bit of sun

588
03:05:29,719 --> 03:05:38,680
a couple weeks ago when my mother was here. But thank you D Flyers. I'll look, I'll type

589
03:05:38,680 --> 03:05:53,079
into Google right now. Submarine, Submachine. You know what this looks like? I played a

590
03:05:53,079 --> 03:05:58,680
series of point and click adventure, almost escape room type games. Is this more like

591
03:05:58,680 --> 03:06:07,049
an escape room? What's the series? It's called the Cube or something. There's like 10 parts

592
03:06:07,049 --> 03:06:24,020
of it. What is it called? It's called like the Cube. Oh, Cube Escape. Yeah, Cube Escape.

593
03:06:24,819 --> 03:06:31,020
Cube Escape is, I've played all of them. They're really, really good. They're really interesting.

594
03:06:32,389 --> 03:06:40,120
But this, this kind of looks similar. It's like a, almost like an escape room,

595
03:06:40,760 --> 03:06:48,360
which I love the room. That's my favorite adventure game, escape room type game.

596
03:06:49,159 --> 03:06:53,879
But Cube Escape is, reminds me of what you just linked me. You didn't link anything. I

597
03:06:53,879 --> 03:06:58,870
typed it into Google. But thank you for the recommendation. I will look into more of that

598
03:06:58,870 --> 03:07:04,149
off stream. Mr. Comcast back again for five dollars. Hey, German John Comcast here.

599
03:07:04,950 --> 03:07:09,459
Just letting you know that I got a restraining order the other day. So I can't go near any

600
03:07:09,459 --> 03:07:13,139
washed up YouTubers. Don't worry though, I'm working on it just for you. Anyway,

601
03:07:13,139 --> 03:07:16,100
in a completely unrelated subject, I saw you in Walmart the other day. I was going to say

602
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:20,500
hi. But then you started fighting the other children to get the last V bucks card that was

603
03:07:20,500 --> 03:07:26,260
sitting on the shelf. So I didn't want to disturb you. I found it weird when you started

604
03:07:26,260 --> 03:07:36,120
crying though. Give me that. Give me that. Idiot. Idiot. Dumb idiot head. That's what I would do

605
03:07:36,120 --> 03:07:43,700
if that were real. Hey, The Jack. Thanks for the three dollars. You said you needed money to get

606
03:07:44,579 --> 03:07:47,940
Jimmy off the parking meter. So here you go. Hey, thanks. It worked.

607
03:07:50,969 --> 03:07:59,139
Snooze and Crofter. Thanks for the 250. You mentioned Mordhau and I played Mordhau.

608
03:07:59,780 --> 03:08:03,290
I saw Vinny stream Mordhau. I think you guys would play it together.

609
03:08:03,290 --> 03:08:06,969
Now that the game actually works, you can create your own character. I'd like to see that.

610
03:08:06,969 --> 03:08:10,409
Also, I was reminded about how some people here were talking about how they met each other

611
03:08:10,409 --> 03:08:14,809
because of your Discord. I didn't. And my girlfriend is almost getting jealous because

612
03:08:14,809 --> 03:08:29,670
I mentioned you so much. She kind of hates you now. Sorry. Well, tell her it's just

613
03:08:29,670 --> 03:08:34,700
tell her it's like Netflix. What are you watching there? It's like Netflix. You don't

614
03:08:34,700 --> 03:08:47,930
have to just just it's like Netflix. That's all you have to say. But I mean, I'm always

615
03:08:47,930 --> 03:08:53,209
down to play with people that, you know, obviously like Vinny and Metallix, Joel,

616
03:08:54,170 --> 03:08:58,329
even like Star. It doesn't matter. It just, you know, depends on what they're doing,

617
03:08:59,209 --> 03:09:11,690
what people's schedules are, what people want to do. Pipe Joel again. Yeah, that's so funny

618
03:09:11,690 --> 03:09:16,729
how that just was, that was all talk from the both of us. It's hilarious. Oh, even,

619
03:09:17,370 --> 03:09:28,520
yeah, you know, even Star. Hey, multi-trip. Thanks for the $15. Silence Redditor. Oh,

620
03:09:28,520 --> 03:09:35,590
I forgot to do Bleed Purple Don't Hit Me. I'm not going to, what are you talking about?

621
03:09:35,590 --> 03:09:44,260
Thanks for the, oh, okay, I see. Thanks for the $15. And thanks for the extra bonus bits

622
03:09:44,260 --> 03:09:55,159
are there too. Thank you. Multi-trip. 15 bucks. Also, Hohohokuma. Hohohokuma. Thanks

623
03:09:55,239 --> 03:10:00,200
for the $10. Have you ever played Silent Hill 2 or would you consider doing a stream on it?

624
03:10:01,540 --> 03:10:04,500
First of all, thanks for the 10 bucks. And yes, I've played through Silent Hill 2,

625
03:10:04,500 --> 03:10:12,950
long time ago. And I have a kind of a rule on this channel where if I've already played the

626
03:10:12,950 --> 03:10:20,120
game, especially if it's a single player game, not on stream or in video format,

627
03:10:21,319 --> 03:10:27,479
I probably don't, I won't do it again because I like the idea of playing things

628
03:10:28,440 --> 03:10:36,760
and experiencing them for the first time with people here. And if I know what's going on

629
03:10:36,760 --> 03:10:42,040
and I know what happens in the game and I know what the major encounters are, it makes it almost,

630
03:10:42,840 --> 03:10:50,549
I'd rather not. I'd rather experience it for the first time. But I have played it,

631
03:10:50,549 --> 03:11:03,959
it is a classic. Explain Clock Tower. Clock Tower? I never played that Clock Tower game

632
03:11:04,040 --> 03:11:20,329
before that stream. I just started and finished it in one stream. I forgot about that. But thank

633
03:11:20,329 --> 03:11:26,409
you Hohohokuma for the $10. Appreciate it. Super Bruce, thanks for $5. Hey Jerma,

634
03:11:26,409 --> 03:11:29,370
I'm going to be in Vegas for just a day for a business trip and I need a recommendation

635
03:11:29,370 --> 03:11:33,450
where to eat. What's your favorite spot? Price is irrelevant. Hash house a go go in the link.

636
03:11:34,569 --> 03:11:42,299
That's my favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas. Torati right now, 10 community subs.

637
03:11:42,379 --> 03:11:49,670
Torati gave I believe 20 community subs earlier last night. Thank you so much Torati

638
03:11:50,389 --> 03:12:00,420
for your huge amount of community subs. It was Torati, there was at least three or four people

639
03:12:00,420 --> 03:12:12,739
that gave more than 10 or 20 last night. But yes, Super Bruce. The Bacchanel in Paris,

640
03:12:12,739 --> 03:12:19,579
not Paris, in Caesars Palace is insane. It's a buffet. It's one of the best buffets I've

641
03:12:19,579 --> 03:12:24,860
ever been to, the Bacchanel. Hash house a go go is probably my favorite restaurant.

642
03:12:25,659 --> 03:12:41,930
There's no shortage of good food in Vegas, that's for sure. But um, have fun in Vegas.

643
03:12:46,040 --> 03:12:49,479
Hopefully you oh and if you go to Hash house a go go, you got to get the blue cheese burger.

644
03:12:50,440 --> 03:12:53,959
The burger is the best thing on that. It's the best burger I've ever had in my life.

645
03:12:53,959 --> 03:13:01,059
It is the best hamburger you will ever eat. That is a Jerma985 guarantee. The blue cheese

646
03:13:01,059 --> 03:13:08,219
stuffed burger. There it is. Unless you hate blue cheese, which in that case there's a couple other

647
03:13:08,219 --> 03:13:14,229
ones on the menu. Have you ever been to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in Vegas? Yes, I've been

648
03:13:14,229 --> 03:13:19,270
to Gordon Ramsay's steak once. And it was immensely expensive, but it was one of the

649
03:13:19,270 --> 03:13:25,670
best pieces of meat I've ever had. That's another great one. That one is in Paris.

650
03:13:25,670 --> 03:13:29,030
Gordon Ramsay's steak in Paris is fantastic. Yes, that's the third one I would probably

651
03:13:29,030 --> 03:13:34,709
recommend. You've mentioned that price is irrelevant. Well, I hope that's the case,

652
03:13:34,709 --> 03:13:38,549
because if you go to Gordon Ramsay's steak, you are going to do that thing where you open

653
03:13:38,549 --> 03:13:42,389
up the check and go, and then close it immediately and look around and be like,

654
03:13:42,389 --> 03:13:46,709
so we are splitting up who's who's who got what did you get? Did you get a drink?

655
03:13:47,670 --> 03:14:04,920
So be prepared for that. He's a cheap streamer. No, you ordered the two vodka tonics,

656
03:14:04,920 --> 03:14:14,360
right? I mean, I got I got a tea. And it was like 250. Your three vodka tonics were like,

657
03:14:14,360 --> 03:14:19,239
45 bucks. So we split in there and we split in the bill. You're just going to give me like

658
03:14:19,239 --> 03:14:26,200
cash or how does that work? I mean, mine was like mine was like 12. Yours was like 80.

659
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:35,129
Are we just going to split in half? There's a I think there's a whole entire Larry David

660
03:14:35,129 --> 03:14:39,690
segment of exactly what I'm describing. I think this is an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.

661
03:14:40,329 --> 03:14:51,399
I think it is. But have fun on your trip Super Bruce. Hash House at Go-Go.

662
03:14:51,399 --> 03:14:53,079
Freudian Weapon. Thanks for the 250, Freudian.

663
03:14:53,799 --> 03:14:57,079
Since you don't call your mom for money, I'll send you some instead. Have a good night,

664
03:14:57,079 --> 03:15:05,350
sweetie. Thanks, mom. Appreciate it, mom. Let's see some Jerma Hearts from mom.

665
03:15:08,059 --> 03:15:15,049
Jerma lied about 5k subs. Thanks for the 250. Your color is going to be piss brown

666
03:15:15,610 --> 03:15:20,250
tomorrow. Wait, what? What is it? I don't know. What is this Jerma lied about 5,000 subs?

667
03:15:24,229 --> 03:15:41,100
What's this a reference to? 5,000 gifted subs. Well, did I lie? I don't know.

668
03:15:48,100 --> 03:16:01,350
Did I lie? What? I don't know what I even lied about. I got a video here from Effectator.

669
03:16:02,069 --> 03:16:07,100
I don't want to put it up. Sorry, I'm being like silent because I'm trying to see

670
03:16:08,059 --> 03:16:15,139
what just happened to my stream labs. Oh, Dr. Steen comes in with five community subs.

671
03:16:15,139 --> 03:16:29,510
Thank you, Dr. Steen. Five more subs flying in. This is from Effectator. 250 from Effectator.

672
03:16:30,069 --> 03:16:35,270
Finishing up the Hotline Miami 2 video felt contractually obligated to make this.

673
03:16:36,540 --> 03:16:40,540
PikaBanana5 community subs back to back to back here. Thank you, PikaBanana.

674
03:16:41,260 --> 03:16:43,260
Let's see what this is.

675
03:17:33,559 --> 03:17:46,180
Jesus. Well, that was fucking awesome. Thank you, Effectator.

676
03:17:48,940 --> 03:17:59,500
That was the most intense. That was okay. Sekiro was really hard and was really relentless,

677
03:18:00,760 --> 03:18:06,899
but I believe that Hotline Miami 2 may have been the hardest I've ever tried on stream

678
03:18:06,899 --> 03:18:16,940
in a video game. That is the most frustrated and annoyed and hardest I've probably ever

679
03:18:16,940 --> 03:18:28,569
tried on stream. Sekiro came close, but I was able to like talk myself down in Sekiro.

680
03:18:30,229 --> 03:18:36,469
I was not able to give myself a chill out talk at any point during Hotline Miami 2.

681
03:18:37,030 --> 03:18:39,989
It was just, I stepped on the gas and just went until the car turned off.

682
03:18:49,219 --> 03:18:53,620
I would recommend that game though. Mario Tennis was blood fuel.

683
03:18:57,590 --> 03:19:01,829
Nah, Simpsons Hit and Run was not, I was not getting angry at Simpsons Hit and Run.

684
03:19:01,829 --> 03:19:14,250
I was just going crazy. How do I feel about Mordhau? I think it's great. I think it's a

685
03:19:14,250 --> 03:19:21,030
really, really fun, funny, interesting, cool, gigantic battle simulator. It's awesome.

686
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:29,659
But thank you Effectator for that video. It was great. Thanks for the $252.

687
03:19:29,659 --> 03:19:33,260
Thank you Multitrip for the $5. Congrats on top fragging in a pub.

688
03:19:35,899 --> 03:19:38,540
I'm not sure if, I'm not sure if that's supposed to be mean.

689
03:19:40,120 --> 03:19:43,399
Is that like a, is that a, is that, that's not, because some people might be like,

690
03:19:43,399 --> 03:19:48,440
hey, congratulations on top fragging in a pub. You know, there's, but there's no space there.

691
03:19:48,440 --> 03:19:54,360
There's no dash. Okay. No, this is actual, this is actual praise because it's just

692
03:19:54,360 --> 03:19:59,530
congrats on top fragging in a pub. What I'm describing would be congrats on top fragging

693
03:19:59,530 --> 03:20:05,270
dot dot dot dot in a pub. So this is a good, that's a compliment. Thank you.

694
03:20:05,829 --> 03:20:13,159
Appreciate that. Thanks for the $5 too. Thank you Rain for the $3.

695
03:20:13,799 --> 03:20:20,340
Jerma is getting Kingdom Come flashbacks. No, no. I was just having fun.

696
03:20:24,819 --> 03:20:28,500
Captain Worgen, thanks for the $4. Hey Jerma, cool to see you getting into Mordhau.

697
03:20:28,500 --> 03:20:31,540
I haven't been able to catch these streams in a while and there are too many new VODs

698
03:20:31,540 --> 03:20:38,100
for me to catch up on. You need to control your streaming addiction. Well, I mean,

699
03:20:38,100 --> 03:20:43,059
a lot of that has to do with, I've streamed five times this week. I've streamed what?

700
03:20:43,059 --> 03:20:45,940
Five of the last six days, five of the last seven days. I don't usually do that.

701
03:20:47,590 --> 03:20:54,020
Some of them have been long. I typically only stream four-ish, four times a week,

702
03:20:54,020 --> 03:21:00,520
three or four times a week. So I have streamed a lot in the last five days, six days.

703
03:21:01,479 --> 03:21:09,079
Maybe that's why. But I was gone for a long time, so I kind of want to make up for it.

704
03:21:17,450 --> 03:21:21,909
I don't really plan that. It just kind of, you know, if I feel like going five days,

705
03:21:21,909 --> 03:21:27,239
four, five, six days, whatever. Do I have a date for season two of Sam and Max? Yes,

706
03:21:27,239 --> 03:21:33,260
Friday. We'll do Sam and Max season two, at least the first probably couple, two or three

707
03:21:33,260 --> 03:21:45,540
episodes maybe on Friday night. Dreams will be on Wednesday. Thursday's a mystery stream.

708
03:21:46,340 --> 03:21:52,120
Could be anything. I wouldn't miss it. Could be anything. And then Friday we'll do Sam and Max,

709
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:58,360
and then we'll take Sunday, Saturday off, and we'll be back on Sunday or something.

710
03:21:59,079 --> 03:22:06,059
So we'll do two days off here, three days on, one day off, one day on. That'll complete

711
03:22:06,059 --> 03:22:17,319
the week there. World of Warcraft? Hmm. You know what I considered for a second?

712
03:22:18,040 --> 03:22:25,879
Just doing a community World of Warcraft classic. Just be dickheads and just run around together

713
03:22:25,879 --> 03:22:31,610
and take over servers. But I would only really want to do that if it was, if we could separate

714
03:22:31,610 --> 03:22:36,860
ourselves. Because I really don't, I don't want to fuck up somebody else's game. If we can

715
03:22:36,860 --> 03:22:48,059
find some low population server and nobody's on, and just start at zero and try to get

716
03:22:48,059 --> 03:22:52,540
to molten core with 40 people and only the strong survive. You know what I mean? Like if you,

717
03:22:53,739 --> 03:22:59,500
we've got to come up with 40 people to do molten core. And if we don't beat molten core

718
03:23:00,219 --> 03:23:05,100
every time we wipe, something happens. I don't know. We have to beat molten core with viewers

719
03:23:05,100 --> 03:23:12,680
only. Somebody just gave 50 bucks. By the way, that is probably impossible. What I just

720
03:23:12,680 --> 03:23:18,440
described is not even remotely completable. Maybe we can do it though. It might be fun.

721
03:23:19,159 --> 03:23:29,540
Tora T on top of the massive community subs gave 50 bucks. Thank you so much. 50 dollars.

722
03:23:29,540 --> 03:23:33,299
And just want to say you're my favorite streamer and savior of my rough college days.

723
03:23:33,299 --> 03:23:36,819
I've been gifting subs from time to time and will continue to support you in this amazing

724
03:23:36,819 --> 03:23:40,899
community. Keep up the amazing work, Jerma. We'll all be supporting your future works.

725
03:23:43,030 --> 03:23:52,870
Thank you. I'm so fucking happy to hear that you think this is an amazing community. That

726
03:23:52,950 --> 03:24:05,829
you think it's a great place to be. Sorry about your rough college time. I am honored to be your

727
03:24:05,829 --> 03:24:09,430
favorite streamer. Thank you for the 50 dollars. Thank you for the hundreds of other dollars

728
03:24:09,430 --> 03:24:20,010
you've given with community subs. Thank you. And from that, we're going to be moving to

729
03:24:23,450 --> 03:24:29,909
sly161 for 250. Hey Jerma, you may not have seen me, but I got into the first few Mordhau

730
03:24:29,909 --> 03:24:33,430
games. It was pretty fun. Would you ever consider making a server on a multiplayer

731
03:24:33,430 --> 03:24:39,850
game like this where fans could hang out? Yeah, here's my one issue with making a server.

732
03:24:40,569 --> 03:24:45,340
The same kind of thing happened to the TF2 server that I ran years and years and years ago.

733
03:24:46,299 --> 03:24:54,459
I just wasn't around to manage it. And you get admins and mods and sometimes it's almost

734
03:24:54,459 --> 03:24:58,940
like you build it, you make it, and you have it just open. And then if there's ever a

735
03:24:58,940 --> 03:25:02,379
problem or something, it comes back to me and they're like, hey, something's going on

736
03:25:02,379 --> 03:25:07,260
on the server. And I'm like, oh, fuck the server, right? Okay, let me get in contact with an admin.

737
03:25:08,700 --> 03:25:13,579
Honestly, it would probably be one of those scenarios where if I were to do something

738
03:25:13,579 --> 03:25:19,340
like that, I would just pay for the server and it would just be like I would hand that

739
03:25:19,340 --> 03:25:24,379
off completely to just somebody in the community, a handful of people that really

740
03:25:24,379 --> 03:25:29,500
wanted to do that. And I would just pay for it. And it would be a community run server

741
03:25:30,139 --> 03:25:39,299
that I was just essentially just keeping turned on. Because it's just hard to be that guy that

742
03:25:39,299 --> 03:25:44,420
gets the message like, hey, there's a hacker in your server. And he's like spinning fucking

743
03:25:45,059 --> 03:25:55,059
earblast music. And it's like, oh, okay, let me go into console. It's hard to manage that.

744
03:25:55,059 --> 03:25:58,100
And I'd rather just have somebody in the community take that over completely.

745
03:25:58,739 --> 03:26:12,459
But it's an interesting idea. Maybe I'll talk to some of the mods about it and we'll see if

746
03:26:12,459 --> 03:26:22,569
anybody would be interested in if anybody likes the game or something maybe. But I do miss that

747
03:26:22,569 --> 03:26:30,250
aspect of just being able to jump into my server. And it's just there's my server. And I always

748
03:26:30,250 --> 03:26:36,299
know I have a spot on it. And there'll be people in it. That was a pretty cool thing.

749
03:26:36,299 --> 03:26:41,819
A lot of the videos on TF2. I mean, maybe some of you people that are new to the channel

750
03:26:41,819 --> 03:26:47,579
recently in the last year or two. But a lot of those TF2 videos that required

751
03:26:47,579 --> 03:26:53,899
like 30 people to do something weird were done on my server. And people lining up and

752
03:26:53,899 --> 03:27:01,100
listening to the things that I was telling them to do. So it was a lot of fun to have

753
03:27:01,100 --> 03:27:13,030
that opportunity to do it. But moving on from that, multi trip, thanks to the $9 multi trip.

754
03:27:14,069 --> 03:27:22,489
And he says, Oppa Gagnum style. Those are the people who, you know, know you from the

755
03:27:22,489 --> 03:27:31,799
servers. Thank you multi trip for the $9. I think Gagnum style is a dance in the game, right?

756
03:27:32,600 --> 03:27:41,479
Thank you for the $9. pasta globs thanks to the 250 haha manual blinking and breathing what

757
03:27:41,479 --> 03:28:00,010

758
03:28:00,010 --> 03:28:14,389
going on oh it's to force you to think about your blinking and breathing he's too dumb to

764
03:28:58,200 --> 03:29:00,520

remember that i missed that noise do you really do you actually miss that noise

766
03:29:25,100 --> 03:29:28,299

but thank you gutsy for the three dollars and 12 cents and thanks for playing i'm glad you had

788
03:33:29,620 --> 03:33:43,829
a kind of a side scrolling contra like shooter right looks pretty cool not in the plans not in

789
03:33:43,829 --> 03:33:51,459
the plans at the moment to do something with story yeah i gotta hit up star see what he's up to

790
03:33:52,020 --> 03:33:56,780
it's been a while the last thing i remember is he rage quit vr right

793
03:34:12,520 --> 03:34:15,959
seriously though germa i really enjoyed your kingdom come streams and i feel that your

794
03:34:15,959 --> 03:34:22,360
medieval game streams results in some memorable memorable material a loot guy for germa rumble

795
03:34:24,520 --> 03:34:29,290
maybe we have a lot of characters that that might happen sooner than you think

796
03:34:30,709 --> 03:34:34,790
i might have to put that together soon we've got a lot it's been how was it like it's been

797
03:34:34,790 --> 03:34:43,940
four four six five months i've only done one since being in vegas right it's been about

798
03:34:44,020 --> 03:34:50,219
six and a half seven months since moving to vegas we've done one but maybe yeah that's i think we're

799
03:34:50,219 --> 03:34:56,100
getting to that once every six months kind of thing here we've got plenty of new characters

800
03:34:58,790 --> 03:35:04,790
yeah it's been i've been in vegas since october of last year time is blazing by it's

801
03:35:04,790 --> 03:35:21,370
crazy now thursday stream is not the rumble i that's it takes like a week to put those

802
03:35:21,370 --> 03:35:26,299
together it's about it's like that's probably like three to five days of making characters

803
03:35:26,299 --> 03:35:37,959
and figuring out what i want to do that's not going to happen in two days wednesday's dreams

804
