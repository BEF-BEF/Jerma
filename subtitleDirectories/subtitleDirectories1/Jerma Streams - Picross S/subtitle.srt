1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,480
Is it? It is.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,919
My dad had over 100 hours in that game, he'll crush you.

3
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:13,880
I'm sure it's fun.

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,359
The online play probably takes it up a whole another letter grade or two.

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,239
I would say. At least.

6
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,179
Black screen, it is.

7
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,649
Yes, it is.

8
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,519
Okay, you guys ready?

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:34,420
All right, what do we got here? Let's see.

10
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,560
I did a couple of these already, as you see.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,399
This one's five by five, let's just go for it.

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:44,840
It'll be simple.

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,200
It's just gonna be simple.

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,630
Use the hint roulette.

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,130
No.

16
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,670
Okay, so how does this work?

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,630
Well, with the controller.

18
00:00:58,189 --> 00:00:58,990
How do I like move?

19
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,179
How do you move?

20
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:19,019
Uh, is this the stick?

21
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:20,939
Okay, left stick is select because this is...

22
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,060
Okay, that's up?

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,560
Maybe.

24
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:24,459
Right?

25
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:24,959
No?

26
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:27,209
Touch the screen.

27
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,329
It is a screen touch game, but I have a controller, so I wonder how this works.

28
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,250
Push in the stick?

29
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,040
This is a touch only game.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
I have to touch the TV.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,079
The d-pad does the same thing.

32
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,579
Hold on.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,290
Oh, here we go.

34
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:50,879
Yes.

35
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:53,870
Uh...

36
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,510
How do I do this?

37
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,620
Hint roulette.

38
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,180
Navigation.

39
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,450
Auto-correct mistakes.

40
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,810
Also controls.

41
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,450
Input mode.

42
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,250
Touch.

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,489
Buttons.

44
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:06,969
There we go.

45
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:10,060
I think that's good.

46
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,520
All right, we're good.

47
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,590
There we are.

48
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,789
All right, very cool, very cool.

49
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:18,590
Okay, so here we go.

50
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:21,310
Those who don't know how to play Picross.

51
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:23,710
Watch and learn.

52
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:29,210
It's about marking stuff down.

53
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,300
I actually can't even describe it.

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,819
My brain's like really slow today.

55
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,379
All right, let me explain it.

56
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,460
Because these people have no fucking idea what's going on.

57
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,099
I know this is like a channel meme, but there's 13,000 people here.

58
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,139
Half of them probably never heard of this.

59
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:43,819
Maybe even less.

60
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,259
Okay, so.

61
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,860
In each one of these, see the number three on the left?

62
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,740
That means that there are three squares filled in somewhere here.

63
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:52,879
Right?

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,919
See this one one?

65
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,400
That means there are two ones filled in here.

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,960
And it's not, oh, that means they can't be together.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,879
There has to be at least one space in the middle of those two ones.

68
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,360
Has to be.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,639
At least one.

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,800
But that could not be two in a row.

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,520
It'd have to be like here and here, for instance.

72
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,199
So let's give it a go.

73
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,639
As you see, one space, three.

74
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,960
Therefore, there's only five spaces.

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,240
One space, three.

76
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,159
They have to be here.

77
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,060
You understanding?

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,699
Are you getting it?

79
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,580
Okay, so I want to mark this as an X.

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,699
Because I don't want to mess with that.

81
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,539
Because I don't want them to see that.

82
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,310
Again, there's only three spaces.

83
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,509
So one, two, three.

84
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:37,310
One, two, three.

85
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,789
It has to literally be, it can't, it has to be here.

86
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:42,990
This can't be here.

87
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,870
I don't know that yet.

88
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,409
But this is, I know that.

89
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:49,129
Mark that one.

90
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,650
Very, very interesting.

91
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,009
By the way, you can do this as well.

92
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,289
Because there's obviously not a one there.

93
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:54,650
There's obviously not a one there.

94
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,090
There's obviously not a one here as well.

95
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,780
So, class, where can this one be?

96
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,819
It's only in a couple of places, as you've been able to tell, as you can see.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,360
Very, very interesting.

98
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:28,199
What am I doing?

99
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:28,920
So here's the thing.

100
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,939
Anytime I play these games on stream, I just, I can't, I just can't do them.

101
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,360
It's something about like this, I see colors, but I don't see what to do.

102
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,759
Does anybody else get like that?

103
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,550
I could lie in bed and do like a 20 by 21 of these.

104
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,910
And just sit there and be relaxed.

105
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,149
But like, I know I'm on camera.

106
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,589
Like, I know I'm on stream.

107
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:55,709
And I know I have to talk to you.

108
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,870
Like, I can't do it.

109
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,600
Like, the part of my brain that does puzzles is the part of my game,

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,439
part of my brain that communicates with humans.

111
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,759
So like, I can't do them both at the same time.

112
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,120
Let's see if it happens if I just stop talking and turn the volume all the way down.

113
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:47,949
This part of your brain communicates with the mothership.

114
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,550
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

115
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,800
You ready?

116
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,240
I don't want the hint roulette.

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,279
It's 10 by 10.

118
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,839
Here we do it.

119
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,240
Let's move.

120
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,639
Here we go.

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,720
This is a full row of 10.

122
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,720
This is a full row of 10.

123
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,519
Just get those, get the ones you know you can do.

124
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,120
This is a nine.

125
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,040
What that means is it has to be filled in all the way except for the two ends.

126
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,759
Get it?

127
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:27,100
Throw this one all the way in.

128
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,579
Very cool.

129
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,379
One, two, three, space, one.

130
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:31,420
We don't know that yet.

131
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,089
We know it's these two because one, two, three, one, two, three.

132
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,110
There's your one.

133
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:39,629
There's your two.

134
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,149
There's your second two.

135
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,189
We don't know where it is though.

136
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,769
We play with heat maps.

137
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:48,009
No.

138
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:51,850
There's your two.

139
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,699
There's your eight.

140
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,370
There's your one.

141
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,649
There's your other one.

142
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,449
There's your other one.

143
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,629
There's your full row.

144
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,329
OK.

145
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:05,050
There's your two.

146
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,329
There's your one and there's your other one.

147
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:12,040
This row is done too.

148
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,839
Where's your other?

149
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,480
I don't know yet.

150
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:13,879
Not sure.

151
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,879
But actually, I do know because it has to be over here.

152
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,879
There's your two.

153
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,680
Here's your row.

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,959
Alright this is your nine.

155
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,160
Your nine is complete.

156
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,720
There's your two.

157
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,079
We don't know where the one is at this moment.

158
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,639
There's your two.

159
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,860
There's your three.

160
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,399
Alright.

161
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,360
Where's your three?

162
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,079
There's your three.

163
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,600
There's your two.

164
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,810
There's your other two.

165
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:49,389
Okay, there's your 3, there's your 2, there's your 1, and there's your 1, there's your 1,

166
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:56,850
and there's your 2, there's your 1, there's your 8, and there's your other 1.

167
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,850
Hope you were taking notes.

168
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:07,189
The game still says Mario Golf.

169
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:12,569
Oh.

170
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:15,970
You're gonna lose 90% of your viewers.

171
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,970
I'm gonna be fine.

172
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:24,259
This game is really chill.

173
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,259
It is actually really chill.

174
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,500
The best part?

175
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Oh, this is the best part.

176
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
If you get...

177
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,600
So, remember, we're filling the whole thing because it's 10.

178
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I love this.

179
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,159
This feels the best.

180
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,159
Because you get...

181
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,159
See?

182
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,159
Okay, look at the people that are confused.

183
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,559
So, because I know that this whole bottom row is filled, so the whole is 10 by 10, it

184
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,259
has to be every single one.

185
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,679
These are part of these columns, right?

186
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:55,960
So I know, see 1, 6, 1 over here?

187
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,320
This is the 1.

188
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,919
So, there is no other place for that to be, so you get to mark that.

189
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,639
Take a look at that.

190
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,639
See the 2 at the bottom?

191
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,639
This has to be that 2.

192
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,440
There's nothing else it could be.

193
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,539
Then you can mark it.

194
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,100
Again, 2.

195
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Mark it again.

196
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,259
See, it has to be that 2 in the column.

197
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:14,259
Because it's already here.

198
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:15,259
2 again.

199
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,259
Mark that.

200
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,259
Because there has to be a space in between.

201
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,259
Make sure you mark it.

202
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:22,320
This is a 1.

203
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
Nothing else is coming after that because there has to be a space.

204
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Make sure you mark it.

205
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
I tried to mark it, and I got it wrong, apparently.

206
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
I hit the wrong button.

207
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,190
Okay.

208
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,190
2.

209
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,190
Again.

210
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,230
1.

211
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,230
Mark it.

212
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,230
2.

213
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,230
Mark it.

214
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,230
Mark it.

215
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,110
2.

216
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,279
Mark it.

217
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,279
See?

218
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,279
Now, look what we've deduced as a classroom.

219
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,279
This is 4 1s.

220
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,679
1, 2, 3, 4.

221
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,440
Nowhere else they can go, ladies and gentlemen.

222
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,730
Please you mark them if you could on your worksheet.

223
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,529
Opened up some more interesting stuff, as you can see.

224
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,269
Now we have another row to work with, as it seems.

225
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,269
So again, this is 1.

226
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,269
1!

227
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,659
Mark that on your paper, please.

228
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:06,500
There's now only 1 more 1 somewhere here.

229
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
I don't know that yet.

230
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,460
What's this look like?

231
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,460
There's another 1.

232
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,879
Mark that on your sheet, please.

233
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,309
This is a 6.

234
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:17,309
See?

235
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:18,309
1.

236
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:19,309
6 is next in line.

237
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:22,389
It has to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

238
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,399
And there's your 1.

239
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,399
1, 6, 1.

240
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,399
Done.

241
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,399
2, 1, 2.

242
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,399
There's another 1, 6, 1 over here.

243
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,399
And I think it's the same thing.

244
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,679
Which it is.

245
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,679
You get it?

246
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,679
Hey, past the snow.

247
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,860
Mr. Smith!

248
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,809
Oh!

249
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:48,809
You're handing out notes in class, are you?

250
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:49,809
Very interesting.

251
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:51,370
Give me that.

252
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,370
Give me that!

253
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,370
What's it say?

254
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:01,129
Mr. Albertson is a dickhead.

255
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:07,019
You know?

256
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,840
Okay.

257
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Yeah.

258
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,269
You know what?

259
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,830
You know what, Mr. Smith?

260
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,580
That shows gumption.

261
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
You just got yourself a promotion.

262
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,269
You just got yourself a promotion.

263
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,639
Good luck in the 7th grade.

264
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,639
You're going up a whole grade.

265
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,190
I'm gonna call the office.

266
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,710
Head down.

267
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,269
They'll get you your new textbooks and your new classes and everything.

268
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,269
That shows management skills.

269
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,269
That shows drive.

270
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,269
You're going up a whole.

271
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:43,200
You're going up a grade.

272
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
All right.

273
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Stop distracting me.

274
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,720
What am I doing?

275
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,279
Okay.

276
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,279
2.

277
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,279
This is...

278
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,649
Oh!

279
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,659
Oh!

280
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:55,659
Class!

281
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:56,659
Give me one second here.

282
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:58,600
I would like for you to understand.

283
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,230
We've got a 5 and a 1.

284
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,230
Where's the 5 go?

285
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,690
Where do you think that goes?

286
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,440
It goes right there.

287
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Would you look at that?

288
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,940
So you get it.

289
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,159
That's 2.

290
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:20,909
Okay.

291
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,340
This is done.

292
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,019
The reason why you put the X's there is because it's really easy to fuck up and forget where

293
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:30,049
a space needs to be.

294
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,049
Very cool.

295
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:32,049
This one is just 5.

296
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,049
Fill it in.

297
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:34,549
This one's done too.

298
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:38,580
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

299
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
This is cool.

300
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,580
So add those up.

301
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,580
2 plus the space 3.

302
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,580
4, 5, 6, 7 plus the space 8.

303
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,080
9, 10.

304
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,860
Get it?

305
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
No.

306
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
I didn't want to press that.

307
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
I wanted to press the...

308
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,860
I gotta remember what that is.

309
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,860
B is the...

310
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
I'm gonna screw that up all the time.

311
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:07,669
Okay, so this is done.

312
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:08,669
One has to be there.

313
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:09,669
This is also...

314
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:13,870
This would be done right now.

315
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,870
This is probably...

316
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,870
This is 3 right here.

317
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:24,340
It's a gum on the bottom of the desk.

318
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,480
That shit's disgusting.

319
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,440
Looking underneath the desk in a classroom was always just...

320
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,000
That's fucking gross.

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,320
Just wads of gum stuck there.

322
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,500
I would never want to put my hand underneath the desk and like push up and touch somebody

323
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
else's gum potentially.

324
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,279
That's...

325
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,580
That's awful.

326
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,580
Keep going.

327
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,919
Ooh, this is gonna be a chunky one.

328
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:03,279
Look at this.

329
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,279
That's a chunky one.

330
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,559
I always love when you get two rows.

331
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,889
When you get a full row removed.

332
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:10,889
That feels good too.

333
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:11,889
How do we make Picross the new stream meta?

334
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:12,889
That's an interesting thought.

335
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:16,559
You're playing easy levels.

336
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,559
I'm just getting...

337
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:27,889
I haven't played this in a long time.

338
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:28,889
Picross Tournament.

339
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:33,399
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

340
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:40,519
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

341
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,519
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

342
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,519
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

343
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,519
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

344
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

345
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,679
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

346
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,679
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

347
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:05,269
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

348
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:06,269
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

349
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:07,269
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

350
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:08,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

351
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

352
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

353
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

354
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

355
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

356
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

357
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

358
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

454
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:23,589
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

455
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:32,140

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

457
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:52,079
6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

458
00:25:52,079 --> 00:26:12,789
2 this way or 2 this way? Do I know that? Yeah.

459
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:22,400
Okay. Okay. Very good. Very good.

460
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:35,460
Aha! Ha ha! Spider or pumpkin?

461
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:48,009
This one is going to be tricky I think. 6, 7, 8.

462
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:53,380
So if there's six it has to be these middle ones and be filled in because obviously you

463
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:59,579
go one two three four five six one two three four five six and there's no mathematical

464
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:05,660
way that it those cannot be filled in.

465
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:15,069
One two three four five six seven eight nine oh it's either here and then forward or starting

466
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,069
here and then forward.

467
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,069
I just don't know.

468
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:21,619
Don't you wish you were playing Elden Ring?

469
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:24,539
I mean I don't need to wish for much longer I'm gonna be playing it soon.

470
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:41,269
Or this one's gonna be tricky because look it can be this one one one two three one right

471
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:49,890
oh I I didn't mean to do that but I was getting it right okay just like I said you got that

472
00:27:49,890 --> 00:28:08,750
wrong this is the correct place for it to be although I know it now three two all right

473
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,750
that helps.

474
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:27,349
It's playing a wordle a wordle this is I would assume this is the two it has to be yeah.

475
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:38,279
Oh that's a big deal one two three four it helps and we know this can't be part of the

476
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:55,630
three because three doesn't fit there that helps too so can't do any more with that.

477
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,430
No this was this was cool before wordle I'm a hipster I like things that people don't

478
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:09,539
like that people don't know about what does that do that's this is I guess apparently

479
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:16,430
the one this was never cool this was act this was huge this is like one of the most popular

480
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:22,430
things this has been a huge deal for like 20 years you don't know what you're talking

481
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:43,529
about well this is the two and then nothing this is all nothing over here I need to be

482
00:29:43,529 --> 00:30:00,970
able to fill in some of this okay oh I can fill that in nice call it you have to call

483
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:07,039
it I can't call it for you I did that's like every like two months I just start doing that

484
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:23,259
don't get me started oh I believe I can do it's technically the one one two three four

485
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:35,029
five now they can go all the way this is the two oh it can't be here this is also the two

486
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:52,589
but I don't know he's got some strats well they can't be here right that's one and then

487
00:30:52,589 --> 00:31:03,190
three is after that so it can't fit here so that helps us with the six a little bit two

488
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:19,200
is the other two finished that row very nice please say something quirky I don't think quirky

489
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:33,509
to say right now how do I have to pee again already one one two could be anywhere one two

490
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:41,609
one they could be anywhere one could be anywhere one is either here here I don't know this no

491
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:53,670
this no okay actually yes is this it can't be anything here got it doesn't help with this
