1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:11,640
VOD Watchers, I'm so glad I caught you this early. At one minute and- I'll shut up. What's

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:19,350
going on everybody? How you doing? Good morning. I'm not doing it again. No, I was- I- that was for

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:36,219
you guys to get really annoyed with. What if you have not finished the other VOD? Well, just save

4
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:46,840
them. Just save them for a rainy day. Why am I live right now? I'm like a- I'm a couple hours

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:01:02,649
early than typical, than usual. There are some new emotes. Some that I ripped from better uh,

6
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:18,859
Twitch TV. And some that are new. Hey, remember that emote that I said was going to be here?

7
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:27,079
Just about a year and two months ago? Well, I- there it is. Dermathing. Remember when I played

8
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,719
the thing last weekend? Wasn't that a really funny stream? It was- we had a bunch of fun.

9
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:57,319
Why are people getting banned? Too early. Too early. Leave. No, I'm- I'm not leaving. I remember

10
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:16,219
that like it was yesterday. Uh, dude. Okay, it was- uh, yes, it was yesterday. Are you all right?

11
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,370
Yeah, there's a look of me. There's also- I don't know why I enabled it, but there's also me ripping

12
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:30,979
a t-shirt off. Somebody's linked it and said, hey dude, enable this! Okay. When you guys get me

13
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:37,590
in one of those days where I'm incredibly impressionable, I'll just- I'll do anything.

14
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:42,870
I activated like five new emotes yesterday just because it was like, yeah, okay,

15
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:57,349
people told me to- yeah, I'll turn this one on. We're going to do more. Battle for Bikini Bottom

16
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:05,159
Rehydrated. And speaking of being hydrated, okay, let's do the complete opposite and drink a coffee.

17
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:14,069
Let's shrivel up. It's early though. It's like, oh, it's not even 10 o'clock in the morning.

18
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:27,669
Yeah, hydrate bot. Where's- where's shrivel bot? Where's the thing that says, hey, you haven't

19
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:37,129
drank water in over four hours? Don't do it! Turn to dust. What's today's sponsor? I don't

20
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:49,719
have sponsors. What are you talking about? I've been trying to drink more water. Trying to stay

21
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:58,180
more hydrated. You know, for a while I had an app on my phone that told me when to drink water.

22
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,430
I'm not kidding. I downloaded an app that told me when to drink water. It was a notification when

23
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,870
ding! Actually, that's a lie. It went like bloop! They made like this cool water sound. Like,

24
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,949
it's like, hey, it's time to drink! And the thing just got annoying because, you know,

25
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:30,040
you're supposed to drink like eight to ten glasses of water a day. Getting 10 notifications

26
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:39,720
a day is too much for me. Getting three notifications a day on my phone is too much for me.

27
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:53,259
Drink a pool. How many times have you guys had an app that gave you notifications that within

28
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,139
one time of it happening you went, nah, I'm fucking deleting this. I don't want this.

29
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,420
Because you were like in the middle of like- you were in the middle of like reading a newspaper

30
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,699
or something or you were in the middle of like a game or something like that and it just annoyed

31
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:12,339
you. No, whatever that is, turn it off. I never want to hear it again. It's like, well, I did that.

32
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:22,149
I wanted that. Oh, yeah. Notification. Yeah, that'd be cool. It'll notify me of something important.

33
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:27,290
Don't fucking do that ever again. Give me the phone. Give the fucking thing to me.

34
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,810
Where's the- there it is. Don't ever do that again, motherfucker.

35
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:48,069
What's wrong with humans? Why are we like this? The term of punching. I feel like that's going to

36
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:59,939
be used in a good way. Term of punching is a thing. Yeah, better Twitch TV. I got a hundred

37
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:10,060
dollars from KXZ. Thank you KXZ for the fucking hundred bucks. It's good to be back. Thank you.

38
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:22,620
That's 100 bucks. Derma Wild 2. Yeah, Derma Wild 2 is there. I didn't enable one or three. I just

39
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:41,610
did two. It's scary. Why not Derma Psycho? I don't know. Why do I have two? Wait, hold on a minute.

40
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:52,069
Why is there a save file here with 30 spatulas at 5 PM? And why is there one at 6 PM? Why is there

41
00:06:52,069 --> 00:07:08,949
one a full hour later? This is an autosave. Did I- how long was this open? Which one's the real one?

42
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:19,879
I should do the one that was later, right? Wait, did I end the stream and just leave it at this

43
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,699
screen and just go like fuck off and eat? And then come back in an hour and go, oh,

44
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:33,139
this is definitely what happened. Well, welcome back to Bikini Bottom, guys. I'm your host.

45
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:40,329
All right. I won't do that this early. It's too early for that. It's too early to be a dickhead.

46
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:45,259
You know what I mean? Somebody knows what I mean. It's too early for like the- yeah, it is. All

47
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,180
right. What was the- where was I? Oh, Gula Good. Somebody said to go here because they said this

48
00:07:49,180 --> 00:08:14,620
is a cool park. Sorry. Oh, this does look cool. I love the beach. It's the only thing I miss in

49
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:26,170
Vegas. No beach. You can use the bubble bash to move things. Okay. It's just- it's not the same.

50
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:42,580
There's no beach. What about Lake Mead? I'm not going to Lake Mead? What do you mean Lake Mead?

51
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:50,570
Lake Mead is like- there's like- isn't there like stores? Isn't there like a bunch of fucking dead

52
00:08:50,570 --> 00:09:04,090
animals and like dead bodies in there and stuff? I don't want to go in there. It's true. I don't

53
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:12,980
know what the hell- I don't want to go into Lake Mead. The game's quiet. I'll turn it up.

54
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:24,309
This robot is called Monsoon. Watch out for his lightning attack. Can I kill him? One hit. One hit.

55
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:33,769
That was a farting and screaming compilation. What happened? What happened? What? What happened?

56
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:56,490
Wait, that's goo. Oh, okay. You can't even touch it? I mean, I understand if it goes above the waste,

57
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:03,769
right? But I can't even touch this shit. Oh, hey Larry. Do you look burned?

58
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,309
What's that mean in French? Oh my god, right? Oh my gosh.

59
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,639
Exactly. You can't spend a day at the beach without sunscreen. That sun is way too hot.

60
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,759
That means eat my ass in French. No, it doesn't. That robot is out on the island.

61
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:44,120
Nobody can get to him. What? Isn't there a song? Oh, eat my ass. What is this? How on earth could I

62
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,120
have missed such a sweet little succulent crab? What are you talking about? That would not be in

63
00:10:50,120 --> 00:11:00,070
that Joe movie. SpongeBob, maybe you can use those sun reflectors to point the sun rays on that

64
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:08,860
robot. All right, let me pay attention. I need to pay attention to the game. If you can use the sun

65
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,809
reflectors. If you hit one of the buttons on the side of a lifeguard tower, the reflector will turn.

66
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,169
Connect all the towers and the light will shoot right out of the big reflector on the island.

67
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:24,809
This is pretty cool. Then all you have to do is swim out to the island and turn the big reflector

68
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:32,330
onto the real and live. Yeah, this is yeah, I'll stay here and protect the babes, but I can't swim.

69
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,230
Yes, how am I supposed to do this? And any of the character can like sandy swim.

70
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:57,139
All right, where's the first beam? All right, right here. First beam going. Push, push, push,

71
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:18,919
push, push. What are you talking about? Push, push. Who am I pushing? No, that's that's wrong.

72
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:27,860
It's gotta go this way. Like push the button. Yeah. Oh, I thought you meant. I thought you were like

73
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,940
push the thing out of the way, like move it, like turn it. Come on. I can't make that jump.

74
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:52,500
Yes, I can. Just jump better. I am jumping fine. I made it. All right. So what what side do I need

75
00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:09,580
to press this one? No, no, no, no, no. Wrong. Okay, we got one, two, and then we got to go

76
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:17,080
from over there. Oh, there's a big cookie monster over there I can jump on. All right, cool.

77
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:38,840
He did it. Wrong. Cross the way. There we go. Okay. But now we go to that one and we got to

78
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:47,419
move it to over here. Imagine if you were at the beach and some pasty dude jumped on your fat belly.

79
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:56,220
All right. This problem. All right. It's probably a guy that has like one of those like bad

80
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,580
experiences with like a little kid at the beach where somebody like jumps to dive

81
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:14,059
to pick up like a ball and they just land right on your stomach. All right. Which one's missing?

82
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:28,299
Am I doing this right? What the fuck? No, I'm doing it wrong. I don't know. Aren't they all lit up?

83
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:49,450
Which one is currently being touched? This one to here. Wait, what does this thing say? Why is

84
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:56,039
there a sign here? You can get to the oh from the pier on the other side of the sea caves.

85
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:14,440
Well, shit. In this reach. I just woke up. Hey, good morning. All right. You can get to the pier

86
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,289
from the other side of the sea caves or something. Whatever. All right. Let's go. There's one that's

87
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:24,149
going to be lit across the goo lagoon. You won't be able to access it. Well, I got those accessed.

88
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:31,350
I'm ready to move. Somebody screamed because they were just like, dude, he keeps hitting the fucking

89
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:41,980
lightning tombs, whatever they're called. How many spats are just too early to say that word?

90
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:53,370
How many spatulas? That should be. I got to be Patrick for this. Is there a bus stop? I didn't

91
00:15:53,370 --> 00:16:06,200
see one. Are you? Are you? No, I'm not even going to answer that. That's like so stupid. No. Just

92
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,080
who cares what character I am from Family Guy. I don't care. I'm not going to answer that.

93
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,399
Yeah. Hey, dude, I just want to know, are you a Peter or a Chris from Family Guy? Like who cares?

94
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,600
Who are you? What are you? That's what I want to know. Who are you?

95
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:41,580
Mrs. Pops. The children's balloons are carrying the children out of control.

96
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:48,789
I don't know, Mrs. Pops. It looks like they're having a lot of fun. Yes, too much fun if you ask me.

97
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,269
You can save the children by bubble bashing each of the balloons.

98
00:16:53,269 --> 00:17:00,490
Okay, we're going to save the kids. All right. How many? What are they? Three?

99
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:09,640
Five. All right. Let's just look up. One, two, three over here. This game is fun. I like this game.

100
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:18,710
You know, I thought this was a racing game since it came out on like the PlayStation 2. I didn't

101
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:28,900
know this was this kind of game. I didn't even care to look. You know why? Because most all

102
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:39,829
cartoon licensed video games are car racing games. Why is this moving around? So it's like a

103
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:45,029
Spongebob battle for Bikini Bottom. It's like a combat cartoon Mario Kart racer. I don't want to

104
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:59,180
play it. I don't know why I didn't give it a chance. I hate that you weren't. Whoa, whoa, whoa. How

105
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,339
wrong you were. Yeah, I know. I didn't know this was like a Banjo Kazooie, but with Spongebob

106
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:11,960
characters. That's fucking awesome. Why didn't any of you guys tell me this? Dude, check it out.

107
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,319
Check out Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom. You'll love it. It's a sick racer. It's an awesome

108
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:22,549
racing game. And I'm like, I don't want to play that. What the hell? Oh shit. I didn't know that

109
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:44,170
one fell. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. No. Stop obstructing

110
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:54,140
my view. All right. Where are the other two? I'm not going to punch it. I promise.

111
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:15,059
Local viewer has 3000 viewers screaming. What did I scream? Oh, dirty sock. How many do I have? Nine.

112
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:28,140
One more dirty sock. Oh, there's a balloon kid over there. Uh, hold on. Wait, is the chat in

113
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:38,890
E mode only? No, it's not. Shit. The chat's not in E mode only mode. Oh no. It's just my chat.

114
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:50,470
They're not speaking to each other anymore. They're just communicating in symbols and images.

115
00:19:51,029 --> 00:20:03,460
All right. Where is he? There's the last two. All right. Bounce up here.

116
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:29,140
Oh, I got it. Everybody. That's why it's so loud. Oh, by the way, I saw something the other day

117
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,099
and it was killing me. I want to play this and I don't know. Am I like a weird narcissist? A weird

118
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:41,940
like sicko egomaniac for wanting to play this? I'll show you the video. Hold on. Let me just get a

119
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:56,599
spatula. I was fucking laughing. I was like, why is this exist? Somebody made a mod for, uh,

120
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:03,559
Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It's my face on the orcs and it's a bunch of random lines from me.

121
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:22,390
I was just like, why is this a thing? Hold on here. Look, let's watch this. Play it now. I'm

122
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:31,339
gonna, I'm gonna. It's the stupidest fucking thing ever. Like, where did you even get all these sound

123
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:45,930
files? Hold on. I gotta scroll down and get it. Sometimes I, yeah, sometimes I peruse the

124
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:49,690
gerber reddit and I just check out things that are going on every few weeks or something.

125
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:59,640
All right. Here it is. Let's watch this together. This video only has 700 views. What? How?

126
00:21:59,640 --> 00:23:34,470
Unbelievable. This guy over here. Trash. I'm a fucking monster. Fuck out of here. Fuck you.

127
00:23:34,470 --> 00:24:02,630
Oh my God, a human. Oh, sorry. This is fucked. Oh, I'm a fucking, I'm a fucking monster.

128
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:10,150
Play it, play it. I'll play it. I will. I promise I will at least run around for 20 minutes in this

129
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:26,859
mod. Play it now. Oh, I can't play it right now. All right. I got a spatula and then that wouldn't

130
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:34,789
even what I was trying to do. No, I want to play SpongeBob right now. I will do that really soon.

131
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:40,970
I promise. Beat the game with that mod. I already beat, I already beat that whole game and it was a

132
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:48,390
fucking joy. I wish I could just delete that from my brain and like play the whole thing again.

133
00:24:49,190 --> 00:25:07,160
There's a human over there. Oh my God, a human. Somebody throws ice when I put ice on the ground.

134
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,839
Oh, so many puked. Well, I didn't do that. That wasn't my gameplay. Why am I saying that was me?

135
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:24,150
They didn't go in and edit the video of me playing it. What am I talking about? Can I make it from

136
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:36,890
here? She already puked. Okay, I want to go that way. Is that like a little, can I make this jump?

137
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:52,279
Shit, I don't think I can. No, what have I done? God damn it. What have I done? You've already been

138
00:25:52,279 --> 00:26:00,809
there. I want to go across. How do I go across? Is there no way I can go from here to there? Is

139
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:07,589
it like a secret way for me to get to the other side of the lagoon over there? Or just go to the

140
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:23,690
right? Oh, I'll go that way. Okay. Call Sandy. Yeah, where's that? I need a bus stop. Oh, there's a

141
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:35,819
cookie monster. Holy shit. This is a classic Super Mario technique. Hey, look at that. There we go.

142
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:56,859
Oh, wait a minute. Get those. Call Sandy. Any opportunity I have to play with Sandy,

143
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:02,549
I'm just going to only be Sandy. But not yet. Let's see what a bubble friend says.

144
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:13,670
Have you seen one? Why? Yes, we were having a sandcastle contest and somebody put a golden

145
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:20,309
spatula on the top. All Sandy she's crying. I'm going to name it Fort Patty town the third

146
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:24,390
and Fort Patty town the third would have a big bake sale. Oh, can we talk about the secret

147
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,299
patty recipe by the way for a quick minute? Why is it so hard to figure out this plankton not know

148
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:38,299
what a fucking tomato is? I don't get it. Hey, I don't know. What's the secret formula?

149
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,420
It's a tomato and onion and some mayonnaise on it. You have you never been to a grocery store

150
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:56,650
plankton? Oh, okay. Should I not talk about this? The golden spatula. That should be easy to reach.

151
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:04,009
And then it's a crab patty. Perhaps you should see for yourself. Wait, it's a crabby patty. It's

152
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:09,130
actually made out of crab. So you tell me this motherfucker Mr. Krabs is running a restaurant

153
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:14,490
where he's grinding up his own fucking people and putting them in between hamburger buns.

154
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:28,150
Oh, that's kind of weird. Am I really late to this joke? I feel like I am right. I feel

155
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,750
like there's somebody made like a really funny like, Oh, Mr. Krabs. Can you believe that he's

156
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:37,589

157
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:56,390
and the water is rising. Oh, what? Oh, what? Oh, what? Oh, what? Oh, it's still going.

158
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:22,309
Oh shit. Classic Super Mario technique. Watch it. Oh, very cool checkpoint.

01:21:41,489 --> 01:21:49,210
just my theory of mine I'm gonna go up high double jump I fucked it up hold on

402
01:21:49,210 --> 01:22:38,250
you can't do it forever okay you can't do it forever I got it what you're

01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:50,819
cheating that's why hold on wait just one fucking second can't jump on fuck it

404
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:58,149
fuck it all right done get me back up there and I'm gonna go hold on we need

405
01:22:58,149 --> 01:23:06,140
to press a button I said what's this for get over there what is what's the

406
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:21,779
practical use of this well I mean nothing's as good as Texas barbecue

407
01:23:21,779 --> 01:23:42,699

1150
04:23:06,540 --> 04:23:11,659
have had with congressional and other leaders I have concluded that because of

1151
04:23:11,659 --> 04:23:17,260
the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that was

1152
04:23:17,260 --> 04:23:22,590

the theme song played. I can watch the theme song on YouTube. Still cute though.

1410
05:28:23,549 --> 05:28:38,779
Can I leave? No, of course. Did I just ask Twitch chat if I should leave credits?

1411
05:28:39,500 --> 05:28:48,819
What am I thinking? Of course not. All these people did a really good job.

1412
05:28:49,619 --> 05:28:52,529
This person worked on Plankton. This person worked on

1413
05:28:53,860 --> 05:29:07,439
Sandy, Gary, Annie, Pop, Larry, Homer, Skorpun. Who are these people?

1414

Oh, those are, okay. Was that like just, oh, that was EU?

1415
05:29:14,779 --> 05:29:40,610
Wait, can we hear all these voices? That has to exist in the game, right? Can I change my

1416
05:29:40,610 --> 05:29:44,529
language and just listen to like audio and see what's where the best SpongeBob is?

1417
05:29:45,409 --> 05:30:12,669
Okay, let's do French and let's go to the town.

1418
05:30:13,630 --> 05:30:24,369
The credits loop forever. Okay, let's go talk and let's just, let's take a look at the voices.

1419
05:30:25,169 --> 05:30:35,119
Okay, here we go. Let's see. This is French SpongeBob. Here we go.

1420
05:30:42,479 --> 05:30:50,290
Not bad. That's not bad. We need more dialogue though. We can talk to Squidward.

1421
05:30:50,290 --> 05:31:06,419
I like the, I wish Squidward would just speak French in the regular show.

1422
05:31:11,360 --> 05:31:17,860
Okay, pretty good. Italian.

1423
05:31:17,860 --> 05:31:22,930
Okay.

1424
05:31:28,509 --> 05:31:37,700
Oh, it's a little more high-pitched than Tom Kenny. Hold on. French was close. Let's see how,

1425
05:31:41,970 --> 05:31:53,790
sounds a little too smart. It's actually not bad. It's pretty good. It's close. German.

1426
05:31:56,259 --> 05:32:03,790
Patrick sounds, Patrick sounds close in German.

1427
05:32:12,270 --> 05:32:15,709
He just kind of sounds like Bilbo Baggins.

1428
05:32:27,099 --> 05:32:31,419
Look, if you replaced any of, you could replace it with any of these guys and I think it would sound

1429
05:32:31,419 --> 05:32:35,919
good. Okay, hold on. Spanish.

1430
05:32:40,959 --> 05:32:43,680
Squidward's freaking fantastic. That's fantastic Squidward.

1431
05:32:47,119 --> 05:32:50,240
I love Squidward. I love Spanish Squidward. All right, hold on.

1432
05:33:09,250 --> 05:33:15,009
Okay, I, I like the Spanish Squidward. I like Spanish SpongeBob as well.

1433
05:33:17,439 --> 05:33:26,720
All right, let's, what about Mr, whoa, whoa, whoa, what about Mr. Krabs?

1434
05:33:27,360 --> 05:33:48,369
We're gonna, we're gonna see Mr. Krabs, right? What about Sandy? What about Gary? All right.

1435
05:34:04,740 --> 05:34:14,430
All right, nice. What else we got? Polish.

1436
05:34:14,669 --> 05:34:28,880
Okay. Polish SpongeBob. I wish I, I need more lines for SpongeBob. Oh, Mr. Krabs. Yeah, yeah,

1437
05:34:28,880 --> 05:34:30,400
hold on.

1438
05:34:46,909 --> 05:34:53,860
Patrick doesn't sound stupid. He sounds cool. He sounds really cool. What about Plankton?

1439
05:35:01,790 --> 05:35:05,819
All right, Mr. Krabs. Polish Mr. Krabs.

1440
05:35:12,959 --> 05:35:32,689
That's good. That's good. Japanese. Here we go.

1441
05:35:45,790 --> 05:35:49,470
I, I like want this in the regular, in just like the English game.

05:35:49,950 --> 05:35:57,790
Wait, that's Plankton?

1443
05:36:12,349 --> 05:36:14,029
Oh, it's cute.

1444
05:36:22,299 --> 05:36:23,419
SpongeBob sounds pretty good.

1445
05:36:23,419 --> 05:36:30,700
That's a, it's a different take on Plankton.

1446
05:36:45,330 --> 05:36:55,419
It does seem weird hearing Plankton talk like this. Okay, there's a lot.

1447
05:37:03,540 --> 05:37:07,139
Yeah.

1448
05:37:18,540 --> 05:37:27,310
German Plankton. Sure.

1449
05:37:27,950 --> 05:37:31,389
Oh,

05:37:47,069 --> 05:38:07,419
all right. Let's do Japanese Patrick. You German Mr. Krabs.

1451
05:38:07,900 --> 05:38:14,799
Oh, Polish Squidward. All right. Look, I'm going to get out of here.

1452
05:38:22,159 --> 05:38:27,090
It's pretty good. That's, that's very good. It's very good.

1453
05:38:34,939 --> 05:38:35,979
Squidward. All right.

1454
05:38:53,229 --> 05:38:56,430
All right. All right. German Mr. Krabs.

1455
05:39:03,979 --> 05:39:11,630
Or German Sandy. Oh, we're going to do German Sandy and German Mr. Krabs. Go to Mermaid Man.

1456
05:39:20,700 --> 05:39:27,310
Japanese Sandy. His German.

1457
05:39:33,340 --> 05:39:56,110
All right. Japanese. They're, they're good. They're all pretty close.

1458
05:39:57,380 --> 05:40:00,419
All right. German Mr. Krabs. And then I'm out of here.

1459
05:40:15,490 --> 05:40:28,900
You go to Japanese Gary. All right. I'm going to do all, all language Gary. Okay.

1460
05:40:29,779 --> 05:40:47,200
What did he say? German Gary.

1461
05:40:55,950 --> 05:41:01,810
I like German SpongeBob. I wish we could get it.

1462
05:41:01,970 --> 05:41:06,500
That with all these different. All right. Japanese.

1463
05:41:16,430 --> 05:41:25,150
Okay. French. Not bad.

1464
05:41:33,840 --> 05:41:38,720
Italian Gary. Oh, they're the same. They're all the same.

1465
05:41:38,720 --> 05:42:04,619
All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow. I'm out of here. It wasn't a bit. It wasn't

1466
05:42:04,619 --> 05:42:09,900
until I figured it out after two. I'll see you guys tomorrow. We're going to do the Olympics.

1467
05:42:10,540 --> 05:42:14,930
We're going to do the 2012 Olympic games. I don't know that game might be terrible,

1468
05:42:14,930 --> 05:42:17,330
but I'm going to try to get the gold medal in at least 10 categories.

1469
05:42:17,970 --> 05:42:24,750
There are 35 different competitions. I'm going to go for it. Not Mario and Sonic.

1470
05:42:24,750 --> 05:42:31,229
It is the officially licensed 2012 London Olympic games. PlayStation three video game

1471
05:42:31,869 --> 05:42:41,900
movie night update. I have no idea. It's going to happen soon though. After tomorrow. I'll

1472
05:42:41,900 --> 05:42:54,509
probably have a really good day for it. I'll set the date tomorrow. So let's run the credits.

1473
05:42:54,509 --> 05:43:01,340
I think I got it fixed. At least I hope I did. What time tomorrow? Tomorrow we're going to start

1474
05:43:01,340 --> 05:43:13,439
more normal. Tomorrow's going to start around noon. Pacific 12 p.m. Pacific tomorrow. A little

1475
05:43:13,439 --> 05:43:20,299
bit more normal start started early today, but you know, sometimes you start early.

1476
05:43:24,049 --> 05:43:34,770
All right. Let's see if this worked. Hope it did. Thank you for joining me. Thanks for the

1477
05:43:34,770 --> 05:43:39,729
raid too. By the way, Kit Boga and all the people that came from the stream. Thanks.

1478
05:43:40,369 --> 05:43:45,360
I'm not sure how many of you still here, but if we see you again, we see you again.

1479
05:43:45,360 --> 05:44:01,840
Thanks for dropping by. Let's see if it works. And I try. I even fixed it too. I even fixed it.

1480
05:44:03,490 --> 05:44:23,950
It doesn't matter. It's just permanently broken. It's just broken. Very annoying.

1481
05:44:31,869 --> 05:44:43,520
Is this person even here? Is that was this person even here? Thank you. Shenro. The one person that

1482
05:44:43,520 --> 05:44:59,099
subscribed today. Thank you. Are you here? You're the only one. One sub streamer. How? All right.

1483
05:45:00,060 --> 05:45:06,159
They're here right now. This is really, really important. Shenro, when did you subscribe today?

1484
05:45:07,979 --> 05:45:28,750
When? Was it like 10 minutes ago? Was it like four hours ago? They left. It was at the start

1485
05:45:28,750 --> 05:45:56,270
of the stream. They didn't unsubscribe. Did they? They said it was autosubscribed. They said it did

1486
05:45:56,270 --> 05:46:08,819
it automatically. Is it them again? If it is, then I don't know what the fuck to do. It's just one

1487
05:46:08,819 --> 05:46:19,119
person. The ultimate one guy. Wait. No. Hold on. There's two. I got two of you now. No. Wait. I got

1488
05:46:19,200 --> 05:46:32,159
three. Three people. This is so broken. I can't even show it because it was removed from the

1489
05:46:33,040 --> 05:46:39,520
Derma Mustard website because he was doing some changes to it. I was making people sick.

1490
05:46:43,549 --> 05:46:46,830
There are the subs today. A lot of people fucking subscribed. They really did.

1491
05:46:52,290 --> 05:46:57,939
I got to get this fixed. I swear to God, I'm going to fix this up by tomorrow.

1492
05:46:57,939 --> 05:47:01,779
Thank you for the subs, everybody. Thank you for watching. Thank you. I want to make sure

1493
05:47:01,779 --> 05:47:08,959
to address really quickly. 100 bucks from Vilemi and 50 dollars from Big Bip. Big Bipper. Thank

1494
05:47:08,959 --> 05:47:19,630
you. Thank you both, you guys. 50 dollars and 100 bucks respectively there. Those of you that don't

1495
05:47:19,630 --> 05:47:27,860
know, I'm no longer doing end of the stream bit readings. It has been removed. Take more time

1496
05:47:27,860 --> 05:47:33,060
to be able to sit comfortably and do this on stream. To actually like do, you know. Well,

1497
05:47:33,060 --> 05:47:38,029
I'm going to play SpongeBob for six hours and I know I can sit here. So it gives me the time

1498
05:47:38,029 --> 05:47:50,049
to sit here and actually do those things. It is no longer here. And that'll be it. I will see you

1499
05:47:50,049 --> 05:47:57,520
guys tomorrow with the Olympics. Thanks again. Have a great rest of your night. We'll see you

1500
05:47:57,520 --> 05:48:08,990
tomorrow. Have a good night. I pressed it. I pressed it too early. Good night. See you tomorrow.

1501
05:48:52,509 --> 05:49:00,319
Uh, raid. All right. Before I end the streaming right now. Let's see.

1502
05:49:00,400 --> 05:49:10,560
Turn your cam up. I don't have a camera on.

05:50:24,279 --> 05:50:26,240
That's all right

05:50:26,240 --> 05:50:31,110
Well, I'm not like trying it. Yeah, that's all right. That's all fucking good

All right. Bye
