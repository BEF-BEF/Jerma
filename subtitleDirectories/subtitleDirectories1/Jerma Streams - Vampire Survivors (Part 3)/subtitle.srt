1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:23,989
That was a good game. Alright, so what do they update in Vampire Survivors? What's the update? What do they do? Let's see. Should I even look?

2
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:32,869
One stage, one relic access, two minor gameplay mechanics, two new arcana, there's one more rank.

3
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:42,460
Did they add anything? What else did they add? Oh my god, fuck, I hate that there's no noise gate.

4
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,340
I do want to turn this down because it's probably going to be pretty loud.

5
00:00:49,340 --> 00:01:00,340
There's three new characters and two new evolutions. Really? I turned it down for you but not me.

6
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:14,379
I turned it down for you guys, thank god. Not for me. Okay, let's put that on the screen.

7
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:49,480
Looks good. So what do we got? Okay, anything new? I need to do survive 15 minutes with

8
00:01:49,480 --> 00:02:00,579
Consetta. Unlocks shadow pinion. Okay, well that's, who's Consetta? I've done almost everything else.

9
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:09,110
I've played this game by shitload. Find the magic banger. Find and buy the glass

10
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:20,539
visard. Unlocks a merchant. Find and open the coffin in the gallo tower. Okay, we'll go to the tower.

11
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:25,539
There's so much shit to do. Unlock hyper mode for four normal stages. Alright, there's so much more.

12
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:32,169
Alright, let's do this at that one first. So go to the tower. Let's refund. Who do I want to play with?

13
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:52,250
Consetta. Where's Consetta? Consetta? I don't think I have Consetta unlocked. Alright, well we're

14
00:02:52,250 --> 00:03:10,860
gonna go with Popia. Popia's got the cool shit. Movement speed, area, cooldown, duration, luck.

15
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:23,050
I have so much fucking money. It's insane. Oh, let's do growth. Revive. Can I? I don't need it.

16
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:39,860
Do I need to revive? Meh. I can almost do everything. Banish, skip, re-roll. I'll do another

17
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:46,139
banish. Another, yeah, another banish. I always use three banishes. Sound pretty good to me. Greed and

18
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,379
max health or whatever I can buy. I can't buy anything, so who cares? Alright, let's go.

19
00:03:50,379 --> 00:04:18,180
We're gonna go to the tower with Popia. No, you dummy. Okay, the tower. Let's go. I've already

20
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:39,500
turned this up. Feels weird, man. What, what'd I do? That sounds good. Let's do it. Alright, I want

21
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:50,970
uh, garlic. So I'm looking for the question mark. Yeah, I'm going to the question mark,

22
00:04:50,970 --> 00:05:08,579
so I gotta go up. I love lightning rod. It's like my favorite move. Feels weird, man. Put the music

23
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:38,779
up louder. Nice face, nerd. You're on Twitch. You're on Twitch, dork. Oh, Laurel. We're all dorks

24
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:57,819
here, okay? We're all geeks, nerds, and dorks. Alright, I'm gonna go up. Not me. Some of us are

25
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:06,199
dweebs. Yeah, well whatever, you know. When was the last time everybody said dork? I feel like,

26
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:13,459
I feel like that's kind of fallen off, right? Oh, shut up, you fucking dork. Yeah, whatever,

27
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:20,180
you fucking geek. I kind of feel like it's, it's got, there's a lot of, uh, I can't, yeah,

28
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:28,180
I feel like, like people don't say it anymore. I feel like if somebody called me a dork, I'd,

29
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:40,459
for a second, I would take a minute and go, hey, like shut up. When are you gonna, I like when you

30
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:46,600
play actual games and not meme shit. You think this is a meme game? This is like one of the best

31
00:06:46,600 --> 00:07:00,699
games on Steam right now. Uh, should I get the tiramisu? Nah. Are we talking about the puppet

32
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:26,569
combo stuff? I never played him before. Yeah, Song of Mana again. The camera smudged? What?

33
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:57,240
Was it smudged the whole stream? It was? What the fuck? Uh, garlic again. I gotta remember

34
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:20,810
some of the combos here. I need duration. It's the shadow from the mic. Oh, well that's alright.

35
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:41,000
It's the mic shadow. That's fine. It doesn't make a difference in 160p. That's true.

36
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:50,620
Oh, the cats. Right. Should I get the cats? No, they're kind of terrible. They eat all the food

37
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:58,710
and they attack you. They're terrible. Um, hold on a minute. I need, I only have two more slots.

38
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,350
If I'm going to do eight the sparrow, then I need the tiramisu. I think I'm not sure what to do.

39
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:11,779
I think I'm just going to do garlic again. The cat evolution is great. I know, but

40
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:19,740
let's look for the other gun. I can't pick up anything else though. I need the other gun.

41
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:51,340
I'm going for it. I need the tiramisu and the other gun. Whoa, careful. Will this guy die?

42
00:09:55,289 --> 00:10:06,470
Zoomer? Binding of Isaac? That's not right. All right. Eight of, eight the sparrow. Yeah,

43
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:13,419
I also upgraded this a lot. Looking for the other gun. This is not even remotely like Binding of

44
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:30,899
Isaac. These guys respawn. It's annoying. Song of Mana again. I think I need to buy, I gotta get

45
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:56,070
curse for that, right? All right. I'm almost there. Don't touch any of these. Ooh. All right.

46
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:10,580
So I want that because I want to evolve the garlic eventually. Turn over the question mark. I know.

47
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,190
I'm going, I'm heading up. That's my destination. I should get there soon.

48
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:23,029
Well, I'm going to do this first because I have the evolution for it. So I want to get that

49
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:47,700
quick. Are we there yet? Nope. Not yet. There we go. Duplicator. Lightning. All right. Just don't

50
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:57,110
mess this up. Laurel again. I need Laurel. It's a, I can't play the game without it.

51
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:14,820
Especially after about 10 to 15 minutes. I just bump into so much shit. Oh my God. Oh,

52
00:12:14,820 --> 00:13:00,419
it's always Duplicator every time you see it. What's hitting me? Oh shit. Fuck you. All right.

53
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:10,740
Ah, I can't take any of these. Sorry. I need the other gun. We'll do lightning run. Sorry.

54
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:16,899
Someone says, I think I'm going to go to bed. I had a lot of fun interacting with the German 985

55
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,899
chat section on Twitch. German 985 was super cool in his exploration of the murder house. I wish I

56
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,740
could stay for a while longer, but at last the sleepy time calls to me. Once again, thank you

57
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,580
for the awesome live stream, German 985. Good night and sleep well. Well, that was really nice.

58
00:13:29,779 --> 00:14:04,169
Hope you have a good sleep too. Ah, pentagram is sick. I'm going to leave that. In fact,

59
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:09,909
let's hang on here for just a second because I'm close to, not really. Just take it.

60
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:41,399
Nevermind. I'm not really that close. I'll get more. Damn it. I need cool down. Bad.

61
00:14:42,200 --> 00:15:11,879
There we go. All right. We're good. I can't even walk over here. Let's make a line for the

62
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:34,460
question mark. There's a turkey right there. Looking for curse, the other gun, a tiramisu.

63
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:57,190
I'll take any of those. I might banish something as well to make sure I get something. Banish

64
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:04,519
the copy pastas. I mean, they're going to get banished if they're not careful.

65
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:19,690
I want what was in here. Give me a chest. Did you guys remember the last time I played this a month

66
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,840
or two ago and everyone was bat-chesting me because I was playing this? I'm not making that

67
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:39,929
up. I remember that, right? That was a thing, wasn't it? I was getting bat-chested. I think I

68
00:16:39,929 --> 00:17:38,420
heard Otto. Was that Otto? Let me see. I'll be right back. One sec. Yeah, it was. Just give me

69
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:45,690
one second. I think he wants maybe some water. He's still kind of getting over the UTI, so

70
00:17:45,930 --> 00:27:50,069
I just want to make sure that he's good to go. I'll be right back. Okay, I'm back. Hello. Sorry,

71
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:57,349
that was so long. That was a long time, but I wanted to make sure he was good to go. And you

72
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:04,900
can probably hear him crunching in the background. Yeah, he had to take his antibiotic, so that's

73
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:11,349
kind of a little ordeal. He has to take it every 12 hours and it's been almost exactly 12 hours.

74
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:23,220
Where's this train wreck of a streamer? What are you talking about? I'm taking care of my dog.

75
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:37,500
Give me a sec. Okay, it was a raid. Was there? I'm gonna say a thousand people from Menace.

76
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:46,059
Menace Alcamilla. What's going on? Welcome. Thanks for the raid. We're just kind of winding down

77
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:53,670
here. Thanks for the raid. Welcome, guys. Playing vampire survivors just for a little bit to wind

78
00:28:53,670 --> 00:29:00,940
down the night. Yeah, he's good, though. But I wanted to take his antibiotic. He needed to go

79
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:09,240
outside. He needed to go pee. He needed to get a special treat for taking his antibiotic. He

80
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:20,150
gets a treat and we can go. Let's do it. Hello. Oh, it's been playing this music the whole time,

81
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:37,609
hasn't it? It's just been going. All right. Should I pick that up yet? Yeah, whatever. Yes.

82
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:51,720
Yes. Really actually not that happy about that. Two of the heart ones. Come on. I need both

83
00:29:51,720 --> 00:30:05,339
headphones in so I can hear the stereo sound. All right. Song of Man is level eight. I need the

84
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:27,960
curse skull, right? I gotta go up. I'm almost there. I need the other one or tiramisu. Either

85
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:47,579
one. I don't want it. I don't think I want to take any of these. Maybe the spinach. All right. I need

86
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:58,500
the other gun. I need the curse. I could take the spinach or I could just reroll it. That sucks.

87
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:34,440
Garlic. I need a curse. Okay. Garlic. Okay. Garlic eight. All right. Good to go. I just need a chest.

88
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:52,119
Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday to you. All right. No more farming. Just go up.

89
00:31:52,119 --> 00:32:06,039
No more farming. It's not my birthday. Is it your birthday? Whose birthday is it? It's not mine. I

90
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:18,299
don't want to see this ever again. All right. This is where I'll get it. That's going to drop a chest,

91
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:36,579
right? There it is. All right. We got the garlic upgrade. There it is. Soul eater steals hearts.

92
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:55,240
Power increases when recovering HP. Let's go. All right. Now I'm going to go up. No more farming. Go.

93
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:11,130
Turma, you should be on Cameo. I did Cameo for free. I said a hundred people's names and did

94
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:24,920
birthdays or anniversaries or it's still available. I think the website's still up. You didn't say my

95
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:46,740
name though. Oh, shit. All right. Almost there. Just keep going. Come on. Give me the other one.

96
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:55,829
Well, I got max lightning now. That's good. Just need a chest. Add more names to it.

97
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:26,099
Oh, no. No. I don't feel like it. Okay. Here we go. I'm hungry. We're talking about Pizza Hut.

98
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:33,780
Five hours ago and now I want it. I just want. I want a large Pizza Hut pizza all for myself.

99
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:56,980
Here we go. This would be the lightning upgrade. Should be pretty sick. Should I get this? No,

100
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:10,139
I need the other gun. That thing's really cool. That's too bad. No, I probably shouldn't need

101
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:22,309
pizza. That's good. Evolve lightning ring. Projectile strike twice. And that's awesome.

102
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:52,380
And it's really, really good. Watch it. Here it comes. Boom. Really need the other gun. All right.

103
00:35:52,380 --> 00:36:08,389
Go get the item. Ate the sparrow. Another one. Durnby, it's 1 a.m. Yeah, I'm not streaming.

104
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:18,420
I'm done after this. I'm like, I'll only be live till this is over. That doesn't drop anything.

105
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:38,809
I just needed a wind down from the puppet combo insanity. I needed a little wind down. Another

106
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:57,800
one. Shit. I guess I could just take the attract orb, but I don't know. Either that or skip.

107
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,440
The attract orb is just, or I could banish the armor or something. I'm going to banish armor.

108
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:28,809
I don't want it. Oh, it's right here. Okay. I'm a sir. What is that? What the hell is this? What

109
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:35,639
the hell is this? What did I just do? I don't even know what I just did. Oh, I found it. It's that.

110
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:58,739
Okay. So did I do it? Thank you. Pop up for arena. The vampire is at another coffin. There it is.

111
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:13,190
Concetta. Very cool. Got it. We'll check out what they do. Try to get the 30 minutes there.

112
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:34,860
I need to be doing way more than this. Nothing else up here. I don't want to get the bracers yet.

113
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:43,940
All right. Level eight, eighth sparrow. Maybe the other one will show up now.

114
00:38:50,179 --> 00:39:09,590
Shit. Shit. I have to start taking something though. Area, it's going to be the candle.

115
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:18,329
I need spell binder and candle. They're both all right. I'll take the candle. To upgrade what I

116
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:43,030
have, I only realistically need curse and then the tiramisu duration is fine. I only need any

117
00:39:43,030 --> 00:40:11,510
tiramisu and curse so I can take spell binder or cool down. I'm skipping. Those are the good shit.

118
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:18,019
I keep missing it. Spell binder is good. I know what it is. It really is. All right. That's good.

119
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:31,000
Come on. That's huge. Look at the area now. Look at the garlic area. That's just stupid. How big

120
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:41,619
that is. Where's the song of mana? How come the song of mana is not shooting anymore?

121
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:55,719
What's going on? Song of mana isn't firing. The mirror broke it. Wait. Why is it? Oh, there we go.

122
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:08,199
Finally. Okay. Why is it not shooting? What happened? The game looks fun. The game's amazing.

123
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:14,300
I think it's bugged. Hold on a second. What's, is something wrong? What's the matter? What's the

124
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,340
matter? Where are you? Hello, Agile. I think he wants something again. Do you need something

125
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,699
again? What can I do for you? Okay. Well, watch out. I don't. Move over there for a second.

126
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:33,619
Watch out. What do you want? Yeah. I, I, I guess there's something he wants. Do you want me to help

127
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:40,570
you? Yes. Okay. Let's go. Agile. You want me to show him? Um, I can't really. Let's see if I can

128
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:46,090
show. Agile. Can you see? All right. Agile. They want to see you. Come over here. Over there.

129
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:58,659
Auto cameo. Hold on. Let me see if I can. It's too dark in here. Hold on. I'll show him. Let me

130
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:10,059
turn the light on. Can you hear him? Can you hear his feet on my, uh, thing here? Okay. Can you see

131
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:26,260
him? I just turned the light on. Agile. What's that over there? Go, come over here. My hair looks

132
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:44,039
fucking crazy. Put this down. Hey, look. Agile. Agile, look. Agile. Agile. Look over there. Look

133
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:54,119
over there. What's that? You want to go? Okay. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. For real. No, he's not

134
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:08,739
wearing pants. All right. Give him a rest. All right. What are you looking for? What do you need?

135
00:43:09,780 --> 00:44:10,820
All right. Give me one second. I'll be right back. Come on, you. Somebody said this song is driving

136
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:20,340
me insane. Why? It's not that good. Why? Okay. I'm going to have one earphone in because I don't

137
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:28,539
know if he's, uh, he might need, um, me to follow him again. I think he's just bored. I'm honest.

138
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:48,900
I think he's just bored. Okay. I'll finish this. This won't take that long. Another 12 minutes or

139
00:44:48,900 --> 00:45:04,820
so. Yeah. What happened to the song of mana? Is it actually, is it happening? And I just don't see

140
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:19,769
it. I'm very confused. Is the animation bugged? Go back into the mirror. Hold on. I will in a

141
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:47,420
sec. Yeah. So what's the problem? I can hear it. I think it's happening. Um, I can't leave. Oh,

142
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:57,849
oh shit. That's not good. What if I just sit here? What if I just sit here? I can just win.

143
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:03,719
I don't have to do anything. Just sit here and win. This is a free win. Okay. All right.

144
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:16,119
Is it, oh, there we go. I don't know. I think, I think the animation is bugged. I think it's

145
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:35,769
actually still happening, but we just can't see it. That's my theory. Good. I can, uh, oh,

146
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:46,550
I need the tiramisu and I need the curse. There it is. Okay. So now we'll, if I evolve it,

147
00:46:46,550 --> 00:47:03,750
maybe it'll fix it. All right. I need tiramisu. Hopefully it fixes it. Oh, I turned off the damage

148
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:22,780
numbers. Yeah. Oh my God. Die. How much health do you have? Holy shit. That was ridiculous.

149
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,340
Okay. Do I have enough? Yeah, I do. Let's do it. All right. Please fix it.

150
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:44,539
Might slow enemies. Does it fix? Um, I, yeah, I did. All right. It's good. It fixed. All right.

151
00:47:44,539 --> 00:48:01,880
Thank God. That would have been bad. Yeah. It comes up from the middle. All right. Now

152
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,059
we're looking for a tiramisu and that's it. And that should get me pretty much what I want.

153
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:27,050
Just survive. We're at a Pizza Hut Bistro. What the hell is Pizza Hut Bistro? Let me go to six.

154
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:46,150
All right. Be careful. I don't want to die. The spammer is one. I don't know what happened.

155
00:48:46,789 --> 00:49:24,980
Tiramisu. Oh, hell yeah. This is a guaranteed win. I'll open up another slot too. And there it is.

156
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:30,579
All right. I got leveled up. Yep. Let's open that chest up and let's see the double,

157
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:41,019
the double revolver upgrade. It's actually pretty ridiculous. I think it's just a huge circle. Union

158
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:57,510
of Ferrara de la Tefilo and Eight of the Sparrow. Check this out. I need duration. Oh well. Okay.

159
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:04,039
Now I can go down. I can collect all this shit down here and I can, can I, what should I get?

160
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:14,650
What's the, what's the candle upgrade for the clover? Which one? Cross is, uh, one of them,

161
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:24,389
right? I actually don't really want to upgrade the skull. Axe and cross. Which one's better for this

162
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:39,880
build? Probably the cross, right? Oh no. Axe is better because Axe is the spin. Yeah. I'll get the

163
00:50:39,880 --> 00:51:12,550
Axe if it shows up and it's okay. You know, I got a craving for bugles too. I just want a big bag of

164
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:34,789
bugles. I'm going to eat the whole bag. Tons of area. Yeah. So much area effect. I could probably

165
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:39,420
just stand still to be honest. Yeah, I can. I'm going to stand still for one minute. I'm going to

166
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,630
collect and I'm going to get all the items. Try the spicy fried chicken bugles. I don't know why

167
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:48,860
those sound terrible, but I feel like I probably would like them. Those sound gross, but good at

168
00:51:48,860 --> 00:52:30,519
the same time. I can't really, I gotta move. All right. Come on. Stop. I'll take it. Ooh,

169
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:42,630
that's a tiramisu. That means I get to revive if I die two times. There's so much food left over

170
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:50,869
from the tierless stream. Uh, I'm not going to eat Mike and Ike's snowcaps and butterbread for

171
00:52:50,869 --> 00:53:00,070
dinner. That's not what I'm going to eat. Well, it's over. Uh, I'm probably going to have to just do

172
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:13,639
santa water or whip. Whip is probably better for here. How much is left? Uh, the two diet sodas

173
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:20,539
are still in the fridge. I refuse to drink them. Upgrade the whip. I can no longer upgrade anything.

174
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:29,860
I'll take the water. Why? It's just area. Um, what were we just saying? Yeah. Okay. I've opened up

175
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:34,500
the fridge and gone. Okay. Wait, there's a soda in here. I drank all the other ones besides the diet

176
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:43,559
Mountain Dew and the diet Coke. Every, all the other ones are gone, but man, I just think of

177
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,199
drinking the diet soda and I go, that's, that's grossing me out. I do not want it.

178
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:55,000
And I get kind of annoyed that it's in there. I get sad and irritated that it's in the fridge

179
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:17,420
because I can't drink it. I don't know what to do with it. Diet soda sucks. It really does.

180
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:23,750
It's just awful. I know some people have that specific palette that really loves diet soda.

181
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:41,880
I'm not, I am not one of the metal. Pour it in your engine. I'm not going to do that.

182
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:52,550
That's a very bad idea. Um, I'm going to have to upgrade the skull-o-matic.

183
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:59,260
This is going to be a disaster. Five minutes. Okay. I'm just not going to level up for five

184
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:15,699
minutes. Regular soda is too sugary. You know, this is, you can't really do this with soda,

185
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:24,170
but I will buy juice from the grocery store. And instead of drinking it just straight up,

186
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:30,659
I dilute most of the juices that I drink besides orange juice, which I feel like orange juice and

187
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:37,260
apple juice. You can't do this with, but all the junk, the cranberry juice cocktail that tastes

188
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:45,019
like you're drinking a syrup. Um, I dilute it by 50% lemonade store lemonade, lemonade you buy in

189
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:55,780
the store. I dilute by about 40 to 60%. So if I buy a, I don't know what two liter of lemonade,

190
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:09,510
that'll last for fucking two weeks at least. It lasts a very long time. I dilute a lot of my drinks.

191
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:21,239
I guess I could go pick up those items. Yeah. I'll just do it. What is that? Um, what is that?

192
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:25,429
What's going on? That's kind of weird. I don't know what that is. I'm afraid to go over there.

193
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:47,210
I'll even do that with Powerade or Gatorade too. If I get a large Powerade from something like

194
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:53,929
McDonald's or something, I always drink half of it and then put water in it, drink half of it,

195
00:56:53,929 --> 00:57:01,210
put water in it, drink half of it, put water in it until it's, Oh, Oh, Oh my God. I'm dead.

196
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,210
I got to, I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Just relax. It's supposed to be a

197
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:19,269
wind down. I'm fine. Yeah. It gets to a point where it turns into like homeopathy. I just

198
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:24,949
diluted so much. Don't die. Please. I don't have enough dip. I'm fucking dead. Oh my God. What

199
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:30,920
happened? No, I'm fine. I got revived. Just run. What is going on down here with this fucking weird

200
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:37,739
cold shit? Guys, I'm going to die. I'm going to lose right now. I've never seen this before.

201
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:43,219
I'm dead. I lost games over. I don't know what's happening. I can't even do anything. I couldn't

202
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:48,340
move. You picked garlic. What just happened right there? What is it? What's going on? I

203
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:54,019
have my screen. Like my CRTV fucking is broken. My CRT TV is broken. What is that? What the fuck

204
00:57:54,019 --> 00:58:07,239
is going on down here? What is this? What is this? I was half the screen. I can't go over there.

205
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:19,909
What the fuck was that? What the, who gives a shit? What were we even just talking about? I'm pissed.

206
00:58:19,909 --> 00:58:24,860
What were we just talking about? Cause I'm never bringing it up ever again. I dilute all my drinks

207
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:32,420
like a fucking weirdo. All right. Good to know. Okay. I go up to this. I go to the sink and I

208
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:38,659
fill it with water and I make the Powerade last an extra, an extra six hours. Dude,

209
00:58:38,659 --> 00:58:53,860
you're a fucking weirdo. Stop. Why can I not do this? Can I buy it? Oh, all right. What the fuck?

210
00:58:53,860 --> 00:59:00,570
I'm so pissed. Oh, I want to see what that does. Gains 1% area every level. I'm, I'm curious what

211
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:14,739
it does. So I want area. I can't believe I just died. I wasn't killing anything fast enough.

212
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:40,179
I'm fucking mad right now. All right. Let's check it out. Moon glow. What's moon glow? Should I try

213
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:50,329
it? All right. What's this new weapon? Whoa. That's kind of, does it go in the area that you aim in?

214
00:59:50,329 --> 01:00:05,429
Oh, that's kind of weird. That's pretty weird. Wind down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm up.

215
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:15,050
Said I was only going to do one round. You're right. What is, look at all this. Um, there's

216
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:30,329
items everywhere. He's cranky. I was, I was shocked that I lost. I was doing so well. And then I was

217
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:37,480
talking about diluting my Powerades. I feel like the next thing I was going to say was, oh, I also

218
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,599
reuse my band-aids too, because they're fine. I take them off the cut and I put them in a box.

219
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:53,429
And then when I have another cut, I put like, what am I talking about? What the hell am I talking

220
01:00:53,429 --> 01:01:10,860
about? He's frugal, frugal. This character is pretty cool. No, no. Why would you don't do that

221
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:18,150
ever? Why would you ever do something like that? Talk to the guy in the middle. Oh, I thought that

222
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:39,880
was an enemy. Golden egg. Summons the merchant in all stages for 10,000 bucks. Um, that's okay. So

223
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:46,699
I can buy stuff. It's another money sink. Well, that makes sense considering if you have more

224
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:51,500
than a few hundred hours in this game, you can pretty much buy every single upgrade in the power

225
01:01:51,500 --> 01:02:02,219
up list. So I'm imagining this is the way to make it so people have to drop 20 grand. That's fine.

226
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:09,590
All right. That's fine. Yeah. Yeah. I'll say what only I was only going to one more than a few

227
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:17,179
hundred was a few grand. It was like five, 10 grand. All right. What was today? Well, let's,

228
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:21,829
let's talk about what we're doing this week. Uh, I have access to the multi versus game,

229
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:28,920
so I want to play that. Uh, let's get a schedule here. All right. Here you go. Here's, here's,

230
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:38,840
here's a schedule for you. Wednesday. We're going to do multi versus and, um, probably the house

231
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:47,219
flipper at DLC. And then this weekend, probably Friday and Saturday or Saturday, Sunday, we'll do

232
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:55,219
something else, but we'll do Wednesday. We're going to do multi versus and, you know, fucking, uh,

233
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:11,690
fucking heads DLC. Sounds good. You should play Soma. When's the Elden Ring PVP thing? You know,

234
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:20,070
it's, I gotta talk to Ludwig because I, when we did that last time, it was just, it felt like so

235
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:25,750
difficult to actually get that to work. Um, and then it kind of fell out, fell out and fell out

236
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:33,059
and fell out. So I don't know if we're going to do it. I'll, I'll ping Ludwig and say, uh, maybe

237
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:40,409
we'll do something else. Go get a Snickers. You're not you when you're hungry. I'm, I'm fine. I'm

238
01:03:40,409 --> 01:03:47,739
having a good time. I've been having a good time this whole time. You should try people's playground.

239
01:03:47,739 --> 01:03:53,960
I'll check it out. When are you going to do the green screen stream? I will announce the date for

240
01:03:53,960 --> 01:04:03,260
the green screen stream when, uh, we get closer to it, but over the next night or two, you will

241
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:09,260
see a green screen discussion for you to please go to that channel, talk about what you want me to do

242
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:14,300
actions you want to see. Cause this is the last time I'm ever going in front of the green screen

243
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:20,539
ever. This is it. This is the third and final four to six hour green screen

244
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:29,210
stream. And then after that, they will be a green screen movie night. I know the whole copyright

245
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:36,010
thing. I don't give a shit anymore, if I'm honest. Um, I feel like I've had that bottled for two and

246
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:42,840
a half years or so, two years, and I'm just going to do it. So we're going to have some rules in

247
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,539
place to make it so it's not, if you do it, if you're going to, this is all stuff for like a

248
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:52,070
couple of weeks from now, but there's going to be rules for copyright. There's going to be rules for

249
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:57,349
length of the videos and we'll, we'll get there, but let's just, let me get in front of the screen

250
01:04:57,349 --> 01:05:07,929
first. Why is this going to be the last one? It just is. This is the last green screen stream.

251
01:05:07,929 --> 01:05:21,380
I feel like it kind of has to be. Can I find the stream schedule anywhere? Um, I don't really have

252
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:27,480
one. Uh, if you, if you want to know my schedule, well, this is not even accurate either. Exclamation

253
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:32,760
point sus, nothing to do with Among Us. I, that was my thing before Among Us came out seven years

254
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:38,039
ago. Okay. Uh, exclamation point sus. It'll tell you the general idea of when the next stream will

255
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:45,349
be usually a date. Sometimes I do it another day, but sometimes I do it early. Whatever.

256
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:50,570
Whatever. It's okay. It's okay. I might do a stream earlier than sus or later than sus,

257
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:56,579
but that's a general idea. And I usually stream about two or three times a week, at least once.

258
01:06:00,099 --> 01:06:05,219
He's never been earlier in his whole life. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. I was early,

259
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:10,420
literally two days ago, three days ago. That stream was not supposed to happen on that day.

260
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:22,579
It was supposed to be a day later. It was literally three days ago. Dermot, when you retire,

261
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:33,829
can I have your life force? Um, why do you think it should just be you? No, I want you to fucking,

262
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:43,670
I want, I want you to fucking sprinkle my fucking ashes. I want you to fucking sprinkle my ashes

263
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:47,909
in a place where I want to grow into a big fucking tree with a lot of shade. And I want

264
01:06:47,909 --> 01:06:52,789
people to be able to come in and enjoy the shade as a, I want to be a big oak tree.

265
01:06:53,429 --> 01:07:05,400
Retirement doesn't, well, that is retirement does not mean you're going to die. Yeah. Retirement

266
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:17,190
means you're going to get cremated. I probably shouldn't retire then. Turn them into an urn tree.

267
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:24,280
All right. I'll see you later. I'll see you on Wednesday. Thanks for watching as always.

268
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:32,360
We'll do multiverses and the pets DLC on Wednesday. See you in a day or two and then we'll see you

269
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:48,059
this weekend as well. Can I keep some of your ashes for jewelry? No, you're, this is what's

270
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:53,099
going to happen to me. I'm going to, my urn is going to be filled with fertilizer and like fucking

271
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:58,900
vitamins for an oak tree. You're going to put an oak tree seed in the urn and you're going to bury

272
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:15,210
the urn. That's what happens to me. Yeah. I want vitamins. I want oak tree vitamins. I want you

273
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:20,970
to sprinkle in a little bit of stuff that I like, you know, maybe some green tea powder,

274
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:33,050
stuff that I like too. A tree will be dead in a week. I want some orange juice. If the

275
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:50,819
thing's going to sprout up and just be dead. Oh God, you should be an apple tree. No, I don't

276
01:08:50,819 --> 01:09:00,069
want people to eat me. That's kind of weird to me. I just want to be a huge towering oak tree.

277
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:04,630
And the only thing you could ever do is if somebody ever came up with, oh, I can,

278
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:10,550
we can hear, we can hear the oak tree, some sound of phone or whatever. I just,

279
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:20,779
all I want is to be able to hear like, that's all I want you to be able to do. Nothing else.

280
01:09:20,779 --> 01:09:27,000
I want you to be able to hear that. It's going to be a short tree. No, it's going to be the

281
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:40,789
biggest oak tree in the forest and the whole forest. Yeah. You're going to put your ear up

282
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:54,579
to the bark and you're just going to hear like Nutella. Yeah. You put your ear up and you just

283
01:09:54,579 --> 01:10:18,569
hear Nutella. What do you mean ow? Stop that. I didn't do, I, I look at it, but that's not even

284
01:10:18,569 --> 01:10:29,270
that loud. They're going to chop you down for a housing development. No, they will not. I will

285
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:39,050
stop them. They will get to my tree and the, it's going to darken and a storm is going to

286
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:44,970
start rolling in and then lightning strikes, strikes, strike all around the tree, all around

287
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:50,539
me. And they're going to go, we got to get out of here. Oh my God, this is crazy. A storm.

288
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:55,850
And then right when they leave, the sun is going to start shining and a sun shower is going to

289
01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:01,130
happen. And every time they come over there, every time they try to take my tree down with

290
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:05,689
a bulldozer, the storm rolls in again. Lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning,

291
01:11:05,689 --> 01:11:20,119
lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning. They'll never take me down. This sounds like a child made

292
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:28,939
this story up. Oh, let's just get rid of our imaginations. Okay. Bye. I'll see you Wednesday.

293
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:35,210
Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother. You know, good night. Goodbye.

294
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:41,829
Take care of yourselves. Call your mother. See you Wednesday. Goodbye.
