1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,339
My friends are kind of shy, press button 1 to talk to them. Stick around, they may have a lot to say.

2
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:24,339
Well that's good. Button 11 is jump. Button 2, what are those? Oh. Why am I taking advice from rats?

3
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:32,590
Why, and why are they, why can they talk? It's all about the speed, dude. See, look at that. Just don't, just gotta move.

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,770
Same exact thing I would say about Super Meat Boy. These like super crazy, like hard, like unforgiving platformers.

5
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:46,770
You just gotta go. You just gotta move, man. Take a look at that. That's how we do it. 22 seconds, almost flat.

6
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:57,009
Best time in the world, 22 seconds, look. So I'm gonna push this rock over to the right side of the rocks.

7
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:05,010
Rock's gonna get hit by the dart coming out of the statue's mouth. Statue's gonna bounce over, off the McDonald's, off Grimace's head, nothing but net.

8
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:13,780
You got it? Let's do it. You're supposed to wait, huh? Go on. Come on. Come on out.

9
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,280
Oh, I have to get this, I gotta get this crystal skull. Come on, I'm Indiana Jones. The worst movie he made.

10
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,349
Fuck! I've gotta get that skull. It's very important. I need to get like the super points. I have to.

11
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:44,019
If I don't get the extra points, then what's the point? That was a pretty good pun, wasn't it? If I can't get, I gotta write that down.

12
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:56,459
Hold on. If I can't get the points, then what's the point? Give me an Emmy. Give me a fucking Emmy!

13
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:08,939
So this is where the actual game starts, huh? Things have fallen already. Unforgiving. We're not gonna get our hands holed anymore.

14
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:15,110
There's no mice. None of our mice friends are here to tell us super secret strategies. So we're on our own.

15
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:25,590
No. No. I guess we gotta go this way then. I guess so.

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:39,430
Oh, I can push this. Just need to use a little bit of science. Once you've deduced the problem with the scientific method, that's when you win the game.

17
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:46,509
Good old science! She planted me with science!

18
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:54,530
I'm not gonna last. If you guys think you're gonna get a series out of this, I ain't gonna last, dude.

19
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:03,060
I'm gonna last like 20 minutes and I'm gonna go get like a fucking sandwich. That sounds like a better idea.

20
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,060
You know what? What kind of sandwich do I want? Now that I'm thinking about it.

21
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,870
Because that's like more important to me right now than this like game that's really hard.

22
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:19,009
I think maybe I'd get a large like steak and cheese with some onions. Mmm. That sounds pretty good.

23
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:26,449
Maybe a buffalo chicken sub with extra blue cheese on it. That sounds pretty damn good.

24
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:33,449
Yeah, stop talking about sandwiches and play the game. Like focus. Focus on the game, not buffalo subs.

25
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:38,780
Not messing around. I need to be level one. Level one needs to be completed.

26
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,780
Fucking god damn. We're gonna cut that out. We're gonna edit. See, we just edited.

27
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,780
Hey, what's going on? Jerma here. We're just gonna play some Thousand and One Spikes level one. It's fucking easy.

28
00:03:50,780 --> 00:04:00,699
This is my first try. You know what I mean? So is it weird to lose like almost like 50 lives before the first level?

29
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:05,069
Is that considered? Am I good? Am I good at this game?

30
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:12,270
Okay, assess the situation here. When I jump up, I'm gonna get shot. So I don't want to go that way. I want to go across.

31
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:24,220
I knew it. Yeah, you can't trick me. Spikes. You always have to look out for spikes. There's spikes everywhere in this game.

32
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:32,079
I know the game's called Thousand and One Spikes, but there's spikes just everywhere. There's spikes everywhere and there's scorpions.

33
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:40,019
Isn't that like a Pokemon? That looks like a Pokemon. Is that like Scorpezoid? Isn't that a Pokemon?

34
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,019
When is my Scorpezoid gonna evolve into like a fucking Scorpezio?

35
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:54,000
Whoa! I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. I'm freaking out.

36
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,430
Alright, just stay right there. Okay, we just got a bunch of Scorpezoids just dropped. Good to know.

37
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,670
Drop down here. No, not yet. Not yet. We're gonna wait. We have to wait till he goes the other way.

38
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,490
Get out of the way. Here we go.

39
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:18,290
Spike? Yep. I know your game now. I know your stupid game, Spike. Spike? No.

40
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:29,420
Shit. What do I do here? What do I do here? I can't do anything here. I can't make that jump either, can I? Can I?

41
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:41,500
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think I can. I can.

42
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,639
Button. Press. Jump. Long jump. Long jump.

43
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,379
So what happens if I die 946 more times and the game's over? Is that how this works? That's definitely gonna happen.

44
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:09,379
I'll burn through like 700 of these by World 3. Well, I should probably be careful then.

45
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:18,139
Excuse me. I said excuse me. You're supposed to get out of the way. This is like World 1.

46
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:26,519
Jump. Drop down here. Jump. Shoot. Jump. Shoot. Jump. Shoot. Got it.

47
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:35,970
Scorpezoid. Get out of my face. Do I risk it? This is a bad idea. This is a really bad idea.

48
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:45,579
I knew it was a bad idea. That's exactly what I needed. Okay. We're gonna drop this one down too.

49
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:52,519
Go. Go for it. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Just don't screw it up now.

50
00:06:52,519 --> 00:07:02,350
Don't you dare. I don't even know. I think. I swear. I'm good. Yay.

51
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:10,199
So what do I do here? Do I drop down here? I don't know. I'm confused.

52
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:22,089
So I must have to break that? I don't know. Don't do that. You're gonna get burnt. Now do it.

53
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:32,860
Okay. It's broken now. One more time. Go. Spikes. Yeah. See? You didn't think I knew that was gonna happen?

54
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:41,980
You think what? You think I'm an idiot right now? Dude, I'm so scared right now.

55
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,660
Where do I even go? When I get over here, there's gonna be like spikes and shit.

56
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,220
And there's gonna be like a face shooting at me. Darts. And you know it's gonna happen.

57
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,839
And I'm probably not gonna survive this because I have not been down here yet. Oh, God.

58
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:06,350
Make it. Make it. No. I turned and I shot. I turned and I shot. I did.

59
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:12,300
And you all saw it. I turned with total precision. That's it. That's it. No.

60
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,300
We're done here. We're done with this. I'm just gonna go for it and I'm gonna get it right now.

61
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,790
No stopping. No bullshit. This is the Super Meat Boy strategy. I've said this before. Just go.

62
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,790
Just go. Don't even stop for anything except for the things that you have to stop for.

63
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:32,850
Go. Like, for instance, just go. Right now. Turn. I'm shooting. Just go.

64
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:38,350
After this, we're just gonna go. We're gonna go the whole way. Whole way. Yeah.

65
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:44,100
Yeah. Come on. Shoot it again. Go. Shoot it again.

66
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,100
I'm beating this right now. Wait for the stupid piss fire to come out.

67
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,940
No. No. Just wait. Hold on. Not yet.

68
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,389
Now do it. I'm just so concerned about the leftover here.

69
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:04,360
And even though it's coming out so slowly. God. Seriously. Go.

70
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,669
Grab this. Watch the spike. Watch the spike. Nothing's right here. But I can go.

71
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:15,279
Time to go. It's time just to go. Just go. After this, you're going. You're gone.

72
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:22,750
You're already gone. And... Holy shit! Oh my god!

73
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,750
Yes! Oh. Ooh. Ooh.

74
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,639
Is that the end? Is that the end of stage two? I hope so.
