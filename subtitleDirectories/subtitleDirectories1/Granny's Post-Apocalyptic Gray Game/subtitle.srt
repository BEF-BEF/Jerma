1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,300
What's up? Hey, you know shit. I don't want any trouble. I'm already gone.

2
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,640
Thought it was an MPC. Get back or you will get shot.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,339
I thought this dude was gonna sell me like clothes and baggage and potions and shit.

4
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:23,109
I'm going I'm gonna go that way.

5
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,980
Just this is when you rush the guy. This is when you rush the guy.

6
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:34,630
Back off.

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,729
Don't make me use this.

8
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,530
Okay, you get the idea.

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,530
What are you doing?

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,770
Back off.

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,270
I'm not gonna say it again.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,270
Get the hell out of here.

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,770
Thank you.

14
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,770
Do you not hear what I was doing? Like what is this?

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,270
I have a gun.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,770
Like are you stupid?

17
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,270
This is one of the ugliest games I've ever played.

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,460
Look at the background. It's like a bad TV reception.

19
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,329
I want to like smack my monitor and make it better.

20
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,280
We don't share get out.

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,280
This old woman's packing.

22
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,099
Go and tell your friends that Granny's got a gun.

23
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,599
Granny's got a gun. Do I have to kill Granny?

24
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:23,099
I really don't want to.

25
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,340
Okay, Granny, you know what?

26
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,969
This lady is sitting under a sign that says we won't share get out.

27
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,099
And she's sitting there with a gun.

28
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,409
Why wouldn't you just be inside?

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
You're just antagonizing people right now.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
Are you serious?

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,980
And how do you not see me?

32
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,480
And she fucking killed me again.

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Fuck you, Granny.

34
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,799
She's freaking out.

35
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,250
I don't feel good about that at all.

36
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:26,889
I keep thinking about the old lady.

37
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,129
That was terrible.

38
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,439
Not a moment goes by that we're not thinking about you.

39
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,930
I don't care about this at all.

40
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,930
I just slid an old lady's throat.

41
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,930
Too late. You're dead.

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
I'm not dead.

43
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,419
You asked for it.

44
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,919
Die. I'll take them down.

45
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,189
Why was I looking down?

46
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:55,750
That's a pretty big drop down there.

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Every encounter plays out exactly the same in this game.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,509
Like people just come out of the rafters.

49
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:04,509
See, look, people just come out of the rafters.

50
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:05,509
Like it's a play.

51
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:09,509
All right, it's your cue, guys. Get out. You're on stage left and stage right.

52
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,680
Here you go, he's going to say.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
You're in the wrong part of town.

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Can they do a different thing?

55
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
And watch, I'm going to surprise kill this guy.

56
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Shoot the guy over here.

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
And then everyone else is going to be scared.

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,680
It's like every encounter is exactly the fucking same.

59
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
Keep those hands up.

60
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,180
Yeah, I got a gun. That's right.

61
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,180
That's right.

62
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
Yeah, yeah.

63
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
I do have a gun.

64
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,180
You're stating the obvious.

65
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,180
No, I'm not.

66
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:53,860
Here's another exciting adventure of Climb the Tower.

67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Hope you're all excited.

68
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
I'm serious.

69
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,090
What the fuck was that?

70
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,090
Oh, boy.

71
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,090
Got to play a negotiator.

72
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,090
Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen, calm down for a second here.

73
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,089
The Tootsie Rolls, there's five of them.

74
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,089
We're going to split them up easily.

75
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,089
Look, you don't have to be that kind of hasty.

76
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:29,980
Oh, well, I just came into five Tootsie Rolls.

77
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,199
I'm going to take you apart.

78
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,199
I read you loud and clear.

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Fuck.

80
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,839
Take it easy, man.

81
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,839
Did he just say goodbye to me?

82
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,279
Take it easy, man.

83
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,769
See you later.

84
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:51,769
Nice to meet you, by the way.

85
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:53,769
I'm Angry Guy with Machete Number 48.

86
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,420
I'm scared.

87
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,660
Don't look down.

88
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,410
In fact, just close your eyes.

89
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,410
Open them only when I tell you.

90
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,910
Okay.

91
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,259
No way I can drop that.

92
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,290
Bodies everywhere.

93
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:19,949
It's your lucky day.

94
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:21,949
You're pretending to be dead?

95
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,569
Why would you be doing that?

96
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,129
There's no reason why you'd be doing that.

97
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,129
These are the only guys in the whole game that have done that.

98
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,310
When did this become Dark Souls?

99
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:49,040
I can't even react.

100
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,709
When I get a hold of you, I'm going to take you apart.

101
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:59,120
Shoot all you want.

102
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,970
I'm bulletproof.

103
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:10,579
That's not something you should be saying to somebody.

104
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,949
Did you see that guy today?

105
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:14,949
What guy?

106
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:16,949
I heard someone saw a guy just walking around the streets.

107
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:18,949
I thought maybe you saw him too.

108
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:20,949
A guy?

109
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:22,949
Yeah, I heard about that guy.

110
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:24,949
Good thing I didn't see him.

111
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,949
Where are all the guys walking around?

112
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:29,949
Did you guys hear about that guy?

113
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:33,949
There was a guy over there.

114
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:35,949
And it was me.

115
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:37,949
I'm the guy.

116
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:39,949
That's right. We're all shocked.

117
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,949
Why don't you go tell your friends that the guy is going to be around for a long fucking time.

118
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:49,040
That's the whole game?

119
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,779
I feel like I didn't do anything.

120
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I just held my gun at some people.

121
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Carried around a little girl like a kangaroo.

122
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,410
Climbed a couple of buildings.

123
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
I did murder an old lady too.

124
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I did murder an old lady so that was pretty significant.
