1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,150
What you guys don't know is when I press the go live button, so I'm you know, I started somewhere around noon today, right?

2
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:13,369
One two four, whatever it is. I press the button and

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,010
I fucking sprint out of here

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,609
And I run out of the room and I finished the last second things that I need to do and I know I got like

5
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,850
I know I got a minute or two before I have to talk

6
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:29,739
So if I have to go to the bathroom or if like wait, I forgot I forgot to put ice in my coffee

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,350
Sprint

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,549
And then i'm back here. You have you have no idea you don't know do the chaos that happens

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,829
Two minutes before I start talking every day

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,020
He forgot to no I didn't

11
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,259
You would just do it before you start you have no idea

12
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,659
You have no idea. I I do everything I sit down. There's no ice in the coffee

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,729
or

14
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,210
It's the coffee's at half. I gotta refill it. I can't i'm not gonna start streaming without a full coffee

15
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,549
I gotta run down the stairs

16
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,500
But not spill it, you know

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,040
He's bullshitting us

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,040
You got to sing the late song

19
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:21,739
What is this?

20
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:23,739
What is this? I have to sign this

21
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,480
I don't want to sign this

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,400
Wait, this says

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,090
Let me read this to make sure I know what i'm doing

24
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,739
says

25
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,590
contract

26
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,950
I Jeremy Albertson will not make any reference to

27
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,189
the binding of Isaac

28
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,849
world of warcraft

29
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,989
Hearthstone or dark souls during this stream

30
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:01,189
If I do I will gift five community subs per reference

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,469
That's kind of unfair. What do I get if I don't do it?

32
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,419
Well, what if I get if I don't do it? I'm not signing this. Where's my end of the deal?

33
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,930
I get some debt removed

34
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,930
Well, how much debt this is important?

35
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,620
100 million. No, it's gotta be more than that

36
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,990
200 million final offer. I'm not doing it

37
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,789
No deal. What do you mean deal? I've seen a lot more deals, but you have to sign it

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,599
Hold on. I can't. Oh, yeah. All right. I'll sign it. I'm not signing it until

39
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,680
But hold on a minute. I need to I need to be sure that this is gonna wipe away 200 million

40
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:56,330
It's not even worth it's not worth even 50 million. You know it. Are you kidding me?

41
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,020
This is like the four games I talk about every single day

42
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,370
You are taking

43
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,810
Okay, let's say during at any given stream. I say

44
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,449
I don't know

45
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,370
10 000 sentences

46
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,909
You are deleting 4000 sentences from my vocabulary

47
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,770
I'm gonna I'm gonna have to talk about something else

48
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:33,530
140 million take it or leave it. All right, i'll take it. I'll take it 140 million the deal

49
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,229
All right. How do I gotta sign this now?

50
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:47,669
All right, if I don't make any of these references during the stream, I get 140 million right away from that goddamn debt

51
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:52,060
All right, I gotta sign it

52
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,919
Let me sign this

53
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:03,860
Okay, hold on sign it in just a second

54
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:23,959
Gotta get my pen out. I gotta get my pen out write that out real quick. They're the same font that you used

55
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,980
Wait, wait, wait, I didn't even spell my name right. Hold on

56
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,970
Hold on. Let me let me rewrite that

57
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,610
There we are

58
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,610
Wait, I gotta get it in red ink

59
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:47,110
There you go

60
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,949
Signed it. Yeah, but don't forget about the amendment

61
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,180
That's at the end here

62
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,139
That I get 140 million dollars wiped off the debt if I don't do this

63
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:13,959
Addendum, whatever. All right. I'm no I okay. Hey, I signed it. I'm not gonna say any of this shit

64
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,480
um

65
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,600
Okay, I so I remember I can't say any of these words

66
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,720
But hold on a minute. Let's talk about semantics here

67
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,660
It has to be like in quotes those things

68
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,540
I I can say the word

69
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,269
I can say the word

70
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:36,069
I can say that I can't say these words at all

71
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,300
The no no, this is a reference to these games not I can't say the word the

72
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,699
I have to be able to say the world the word world

73
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,259
This is unfair

74
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:55,160
These are references. Yes. All right. I get it. All right, it's been it's been signed

75
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,160
I gotta keep this on my other monitor

76
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,560
So I remember what games it is because i'm gonna be like, oh man. Oh, here's the enemy from

77
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,519
Never mind

78
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,639
I can't wait to not do this and just get 140 million shaved off

79
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
All right. I got the games right here

80
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,209
Oh

81
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,370
Oh shit, I burnt it into my monitor

82
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,420
Oh well

83
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,420
That's that's just my watermark

84
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,750
Yeah, we're gonna play hades

85
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,470
I welcome everybody. Hope you had a good a few days

86
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,060
Oc don't steal it. Don't steal it. It's mine

87
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,629
What's your name on top?

88
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,629
No, i'm not i'm not gonna just put my name. Uh, here's my name up top

89
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:57,139
That would be so weird

90
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,699
Like i'm so desperate i'm so like scared that somebody's gonna steal this stream or something

91
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,410
Why didn't you watermark a stream? But why would you watermark a stream with your your full name?

92
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,649
Wouldn't it be a username or a production industry or company or something?

93
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,250
Uh, we got we got community subs

94
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,740
10, uh to be exact

95
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,899
By an anonymous gifter don't know who it is, but that's actually your name on twitch

96
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,860
So we know who you are, but we don't know who's behind the mask

97
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,389
Thanks for the 10 subs

98
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,069
And we also had five subs from ruined ruined bloodline. Thank you for the five community subs

99
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:53,939
Both you guys back to back there. Thank you

100
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,120
As he played this before I have never played hades before

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,160
The title of the stream should tell you all you need to know

102
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,300
I saw that it was nominated for game of the year. It's been recommended a bunch of times and I didn't play it

103
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,899
so this is a uh

104
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:13,100
This is a this is a game of the year nominated bandwagon stream

105
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,329
Well, I guess I got nominated for game of the year

106
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,370
So, uh, i'm gonna play it. I guess I did the same thing with celeste

107
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,259
So, you know

108
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,660
That's what we do here

109
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,139
Is it it's it's apparently it's very very good

110
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:46,629
Very good from what I understand. Oh my god, please don't turn the camera on. Okay. Good. Hey easy cash

111
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,299
Thanks for the 10 community subs

112
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:58,779
Easy cash another 10 and i'm ready. I think the settings are good. I turned off screen shake

113
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:06,919
Screen shake in my opinion should be something you have to turn on not turn off. I don't know who likes it

114
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,470
I don't think i've met a single person that actually likes to use screen shake screen shake. It's weird, right?

115
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:26,039
Does and does anyone like it? It just like hurts your head. What about the wisdom music? Am I echoing?

116
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,460
Okay. No, that's just the okay. Never mind. It's on it's very low

117
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,899
It's all right. I turned it on

118
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:42,250
I don't like music in my ears loud. I'm telling you you guys already know that it distracts me

119
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:46,409
I I I drive a car silent. I play games in silence

120
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:54,570
But on god mode why?

121
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:01,100
Music's so good. All right, and you'll be able to hear it slightly on god mode. You're gonna need it

122
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,419
Well, that's a great opinion of yours that you can have

123
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,940
Until I don't get hit one time in the first hour of the stream and i'm willing to bet

124
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,590
Okay, I was gonna say a bunch of like way. I can't say these words

125
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,980
Not bet no more bets. Let's go. What's hell mode?

126
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:24,120
Don't even want to I don't even want to see what it is. I'm just gonna go

127
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:39,929
Inspires. Oh if I get hit in the first hour of the game, i'm gonna go that's it which we all share to tell you such a tale

128
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,820
Listen carefully

129
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,779
Okay

130
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:50,820
That us

131
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,899
Oh, wow. This is weird

132
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,549
This is weird to help with this place this top like this angle and the the color is

133
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:05,190
Can't hear anything. Yeah, you can you can hear it. I know you can hear it

134
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:11,590
There is that better?

135
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,590
Wait, okay. Let's go

136
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,419
All right, the combat's pretty fluid so this is like a

137
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,419
No, it's not on this list

138
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:26,940
Is diablo 2 is not on this list. You really fucked it up. Didn't you?

139
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,519
You didn't fuck it up. Did you? Oh you did actually you fucked it up bad leaving mine. Stop me

140
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,799
All right. All right. I get it. You cannot add anything by the way. This is a dash

141
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,320
There's a there's a roll

142
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,820
like in um

143
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
Like that game, uh

144
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,330
Splinter cell

145
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:03,529
Is there a dodge roll in splinter cell

146
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:11,990
Is it now it's too loud. You see i'm telling you you guys it's you guys have goldilocks in this

147
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,750
It's i'm gonna turn the all right. Here we go. I'm gonna turn the music up and the sound down

148
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,970
Check this out ready sound down

149
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,049
Music up

150
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,970
How's that?

151
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:31,159
All right, dude, has it been an hour yet?

152
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,759
It's been like an hour

153
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:41,960
I haven't even got touched once it's been an hour. It plays very good though. I like it

154
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,210
Like to break everything

155
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,779
It's like an arena. Oh

156
00:12:53,419 --> 00:13:06,009
Is it an arena game? Oh, okay except it's got to be her here goes nothing in the name of hades

157
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,570
Olympus I accept this message

Hail noble cousin

160

Now let's get you from that miserable place. I'll see that all of us upon olympus do our part. There's athena with me

161
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,850

They make up this guy's zoggers. I thought this was supposed to be hades, isn't it?

163
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,860
Okay, do choose one bonus of athena

Divine your attack is stronger and can deflect 40% more attack damage you serious

165
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,730
Okay, your cast damage is posed in a small area and can deflect

166
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,490
85 your dash deals damage and can deflect

167
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:58,730
I think we're gonna have to go with divine strike press or hold x to use your main weapon

168
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:00,649
And we can deflect

169
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:08,470
The dash the dash dash awful awful awful. Well, I don't know your dash deals damage. All right, let's try it

170
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,789
I know you can't hear me all the way where you are goddess. Oh that it doesn't end a different animation, too

171
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:18,940
The reflect is good. All right

172
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,970
Stand aside. Oh, it does 10 damage. That's pretty good

173
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,809
I do 20 damage a swing. That's 50 damage just from dashing

174
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,289
Oh, that's a trap

175
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:31,370
I know there were traps in this game. How was I supposed to know?

176
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:37,799
I'm getting booed. I'm getting booed

177
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,850
Stop booing me for what?

178
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,250
What did I do? All right, should I try deflecting?

179
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:57,419
You should have listened gain one key. Oh, I kind of like this game

180
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,419
Each exit has its own reward. I like this game. This game's pretty good. It's pretty fun so far

181
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,419
I hope it does. I hope they don't drop the ball in the end zone

182
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:16,700
Okay, each what what are the symbols mean? What's okay? What's the steer? What's the like steering wheel versus the pitch for?

183
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:29,259
All right. I'm gonna go steering wheel. I'm gonna go the ship steering wheel. All right concentrate

184
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:35,269
Okay, I see that the things pop up over their heads. Is that is it like batman? Are they about to shoot me?

185
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,899
Like batman when it's like the indicator pops over their head and I press y to block it

186
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,539
Like I can deflect it. So here he goes. He's about to shoot you

187
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,360
Bad ending bugsnacks in hades banger stream and banger stream. Thanks

188
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,789
So this is an upgrade, okay, so this is a boon of athena so that's what that steering

189
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:17,019
Oh, this is an epic one. What's that?

190
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:26,179
There's different rarities your cast damages foes in a small area and can deflect so that's a different move

191
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:34,889
Your abilities that can deflect also make foes exposed. Oh shit so I can wait. Hold on a minute

192
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,340
Don't don't look at the flashy purple letters. I can dash through people and hit them in the back

193
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:52,779
This is 90 damage reduce from traps. I don't want that. That's I mean, i'm sure it'll be useful for me

194
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,360
Because i'm 90 damage is good. Yeah, but if I step on stuff all the time. Oh, yeah, that's probably good for me

195
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,620
But I want this one

196
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,809
I can go wham wham wham wham wham

197
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,170
I'm already making a build. I don't I don't need your advice

198
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:21,430
I had over like 300 days played on team fortress 2. I know how to make loadouts

199
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:32,809
I know how to make a character look good. I know how to make a character strong. I gotta be careful

200
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:39,380
I'll slip up there. I will that's a tf2 reference. Yeah, it sure is not on that list though, is it?

201
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:47,400
Get out of the way. I'm trying to do the thing. What the fuck does that do? Oh nice

202
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Nice. All right. Cool. This game's pretty good

203
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,900
Oh this i'm i'm i

204
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,339
I like it

205
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:01,579
It's juggles

206
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:02,940
Wait, what is that?

207
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,420
All right, there's one more fat guy over here

208
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:20,970
Backstab backstab backstab juggles is the great. Oh, I got hit

209
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
You can cleave too

210
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,980
Oh gain 10 what was that 10 what that's plus 10

211
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:37,430
The clash of clans currency. Thank god. I didn't say in one of those four games

212
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
This is gonna be way harder than I thought

213
00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:01,420
I need health

214
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,819
I have to be so careful. All right, let's let's pull don't just be an idiot pull one at a time

215
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,990
This game's a hard game. It's not an easy game. No, I don't want three of you. There's my one

216
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,190
How did you hit me? What really?

217
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:25,400
Do not spawn

218
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Oh shit, i'm in trouble. All right

219
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,839
Oh good, we're good. We're good. Oh my god. We're not good. We're not good. Wait, can I go into the traps?

220
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,339
Use your special

221
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:44,009
I didn't know I even had one

222
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:48,730
What?

223
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,970
And why?

224
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,970
I don't even know what that I didn't know I even had this move

225
00:19:53,529 --> 00:20:03,509
Is this a reddit game? Probably

226
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:11,430
Just because you said it was if you but hey, don't you know if you think it's a reddit game?

227
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:12,549
It's a reddit game

228
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:17,269
You wouldn't even have that you wouldn't even think that it's a reddit game if you if you could if there was any doubt

229
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:28,410
There's only one hatcher I know of it's a twitter game hold on a minute anyway in the name of hades olympus I accept this message

230
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,640
All right, I had to clear my throat

231
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,160
All right, so there's a new message

232
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,440
Artemis i'm not like all the others on olympus the power of the hunt helps keep me company. So

233
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,319
Maybe it'll help you to use the fucking buttons. I I look i've just I don't know they didn't tell me I had like a heavy attack

234
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:52,710
It started five minutes ago. I just started five minutes ago

235
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:57,930
You don't tell the the the kid and his first day of culinary school

236
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,440
He has to bake make a wedding cake and if it's not the best wedding cake that the teacher's ever eaten

237
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,079
Then he's gonna just get kicked out of school. That's not how this works

238
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:15,829
Oh, what a minute any damage you do has a chance to be crit. All right, so this is just like fuck this thing

239
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,099
This thing's way better

240
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:23,619
15 crit or he's get three percent crit

241
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:33,940
That's terrible. All right, we're doing deadly strike. It sounds like good company to keep

242
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,859
the

243
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,859
double cube for boon info

244
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:43,690
Can't heal myself, but I can fight this shit. This just shows you everything you have

245
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:52,299
That's helpful. It's a fucking cursed link. Hold on. Let's take a look at whatever this cursed link is

246
00:21:53,349 --> 00:22:12,599
I'll be the judge of that. Yep, which path all right, wait, this means it's a boss there and then this means health

247
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:25,460
I'm getting the health

248
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:34,099
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill. It's pretty clean

249
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,819
That's not that much health at all. That's no health. That's none. That's zero health

250
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:58,099
It's 25 health. I thought it was gonna be like a full heal. Oh, these are elites which is they absorb my blow

251
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:07,829
How could they?

252
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:13,140
Well, I just saw somebody say the word and I I must was like, you know what? Yep, what's gonna happen?

253
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,640
Ooh

254
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,880
Starting to have to pay more attention to things

255
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:29,750
Ooh

256
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:38,140
What's wrong with me? What's my character being weird? Is the game good? Yeah

257
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:42,539
So far, I mean i'm in the first zone. I'm assuming it's gonna get way harder

258
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:50,009
You have controller drift, is that true?

259
00:23:50,650 --> 00:24:00,380
Well, I gotta use y more often. It's good

260
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:11,079
All right, let's go bring it on

261
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,079
Shoot me. Oh

262
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:22,809
Come over

263
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:26,089
Game is low. It's not I can see how loud it is right now

264
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,740
It's very loud

265
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,529
Ooh, what's this?

266
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:44,089
Pomegranate versus bag of treasure. Hmm. I'm gonna say bag of treasure hurts my ears

267
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:52,180
Do it louder we can take it. I don't think you can take it

268
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:56,549
Oh

269
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:59,690
Hold on. I get

270
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,609
I get the mcdonald. I get the travis scott meal

271
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:10,339
Or a pomegranate. What do I want?

272
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,740
Nobody liked that one. Some of you did some of you did so they get the pomegranate. I don't even want to do it

273
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,019
What does it do?

274
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,369
I'm useful

275
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:22,180
arm of power

276
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,339
Uh, okay. I just get to pick an upgrade

277
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,130
Oh wait, you can up these upgrade

278
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:33,450
That's pretty cool

279
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,970
Okay, so dash deals damaging into flight. So this just increases the damage

280
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,380
Bonus backstab 70%

281
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:49,430
I think I have to do this one. That's so much more of these upon olympus. Who's this guy?

282
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:55,269
This is charon

283
00:25:56,069 --> 00:26:00,700
I get to see you care on night just minding my own business taking in the sights and

284
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,059
Sure is awfully convenient to be running into you like this charon

285
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,019
Guys, I haven't I don't know. I look I know like I know

286
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,140
The only reason why I know these characters is because of smite

287
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,859
you know

288
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:17,220
mercury

289
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,740
He's probably in the game

290
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,180
hades

291
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,180
um

292
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,490
artemis

293
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,940
uh

294
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,140
athena

295
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,630
uh

296
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,769
This is not a okay. No

297
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:40,779
Place might is the games is that is the game still fun or did they ruin it? They could have the infernal heirs of the zoos

298
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:49,829
Yeah, all those greek gods zeus athena tiny tim's great thirst for riches

299
00:26:50,390 --> 00:27:00,250
All right. Well, I got my I got what I wanted

300
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:05,049
tiny tímacus

301
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
They added the ninja turtles. Yeah, I know

302
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,559
Like we we already talked about it. I've already very upset about it

303
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,259
I got a backstab to do more damage

304
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,730
Why even deflect they have a little shield who cares just smash them

305
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:37,460
You're gonna do a bake state

306
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
There it is 93 damage pretty good

307
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:47,529
I like this game. I think i'm pretty good too. I think i'm pretty good

308
00:27:48,329 --> 00:28:04,759
I think i'm pretty good

309
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,759
You can always tell right?

310
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,569
In a game where I don't know what the fuck's going on i'm really bad

311
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:15,210
I usually would be just walking around getting hit by random projectiles going. Hey, wait, what did this one do?

312
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,259
Gain a hundred points

313
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:29,460
you can

314
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,900
dash over

315
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
I missed it. Somebody says something important

316
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,710
All right, so I don't I don't have a key

317
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:45,430
What was my key list? I can either get purple currency or go key

318
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,339
Dash over what you can dash over gaps. Oh, can I fall in gaps?

319
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,119
You cannot fall in gaps. Thank god

320
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:04,009
Um, let's stay consistent. I want the purple stuff numbskulls

321
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,700
That's what they're called

322
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:14,490
numbskulls

323
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:21,369
Just smash everything

324
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:31,720
I'm gonna have to drink a little bit more coffee for this game. I thought this was a family friendly stream. It is

325
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Your family is just psycho

326
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,660
You know, I will say here's an automatic plus one letter grade. Um, hold on. Don't stop stop stop talking

327
00:29:46,299 --> 00:30:09,019
Hold on. Stop talking. I could pick this back up. I didn't know I could do that

328
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:16,920
Oh my god, why did I look at chat? That was stupid. Okay. Uh, this gets automatically plus one letter grade

329
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,049
because

330
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,049
Uh, it telegraphs

331
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:27,130
Where the enemy is going to come up next in the spawn and it's there for a full second or so

332
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Absolute plus one letter grade

333
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,740
I'm gonna die

334
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,140
that's

335
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,700
Uh, well, how can I get health shot probably right?

336
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,369
Yeah, you can talk

337
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:45,849

338
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:46,970
Ooh

339
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,759
How much do I have?

340
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:57,289
All right, what heals more the food?

341
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,549
All right. Hold on. I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding

342
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,079
Oh, this is max health. I was wondering why 25. I was like, why is this so much more expensive? Okay

343
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,259
That's max health

344
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:17,420
I get it. And then this is a super upgrade

345
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,140
I don't have enough money for the super upgrade

346
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Please drink a sprite on stream

347
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:41,640
The prince's reckoning no, I don't want to do I only drink sprites on airplanes and I can reckon quite a bit

348
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:52,680
All right. I'm good

349
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,359
Ginger ale or pineapple juice. Well, this is awkward. Oh

350
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
boss fight

351
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,240
Omega lull it's oh mega mega

352
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:08,089
All zagris not one step further. This is this character is not in smite. I don't know who this is

353
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,430
that's the problem zagris and

354
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,349
Omega mega are not in smite. So I don't know they don't be may as well not exist

00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:28,089
Besides don't you have someplace else to be your father sent me i'll be on your bad side than his

356
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:33,269
You can turn back and a education or I can send you home the painful way

357
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,569
No, the true twitch education here would be

358
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,529
Hey, give me a tier list. I'm gonna do a tier list of the greek and roman gods

359
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:56,019
Oh, this is a fight. All right. I'm ready

360
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:57,700

00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,309

365
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:29,910

367
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,069
Okay, so i'm gonna be i'm gonna be very very clear

368
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:56,200
I lost that because I was so trying so hard to not say I have to treat this like

369
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,740
I was concentrating on not saying a sentence versus playing the game

370
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,900
Yeah, it's scripted anyways, it's supposed to it's scripted look you're supposed to die

371
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,469
Some of us more than others

372
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:31,380
Probably me

373
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,380
Some of us more than other streamers

374
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,510
Like the 180 attempts I had at cuphead

375
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,460
See if I come close this time

376
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:52,329
What's this stupid boy? Oh there is I told you nobody gets out of here

377
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:01,699
Transacking of my domain. I know viewers are leaving is bugleberry

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,079

What do I care

381
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,610
You shall never reach the surface

382
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:21,369
go

383
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,969

384
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:27,420
at the dog

385
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,219
There's a good boy. Of course, you can pet the dog in hades

386
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:32,860
Yeah, that's servers

387
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:38,519
Oh, we're gonna have to fight this dog later. That's the ultimate

388
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,280
trail

389
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,260
Okay, so who are these people?

390
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,300

Believe it nix grateful that you put us into contact. I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out

392
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,789
The risk is not to me

393
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:15,909
I expected the olympians would involve themselves in this any junk.com game reveal to them no more than they already know

394
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:17,989
The hell are you talking about we understood

Yes, we are then go you need to address horny chat, you know

396
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,219
Can I gotta make a statement here? Can I just say I don't know what happened

397
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:34,219
I think it was since the great ass revealing

398
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,820
You guys are

399
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:42,900
I'd say like plus 40 percent hornier than like a year ago. Is that what happened?

400
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:52,059
What what's going on here?

401
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:58,760
Watch dog servers regards the underworld with mixed emotions. Stop saying that it's november purest joy

402
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Oh, well deepest melancholy

403
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:15,420
I'm not i'm not gonna even respond to that you watch over things for me. Won't you boy? I'd take you if I could no

404
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,949
non-stop

405
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:22,949
Something something in this month

406
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:28,570
That's fucking ridiculous returned

407
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:32,539
Who are all these people?

408
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:34,059
Achilles

409
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:39,429
You're training out there. That's this is the reason why your your heel is named after this guy

410
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,920
Because he had a he had a bad foot and during one of the wars

411
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:55,190
He like twisted his ankle and it got like it's like stopped on or something. That's wrong. I just I have no idea

412
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:10,889
And fear is for the weak. Take care achilles. He was random ghosts. You should play smite

413
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,500
You know if I I would play smite on stream if it wasn't guaranteed

414
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,320
I'd get like 10 viewership and 100 embarrassment

415
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:28,590
House of hades appointed layer of the underworld's king

416
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,230
Is home not just to him

417
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,230
But to his willful protony

418
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,239
Oh, so these are all my trinkets

419
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:44,780
You know, I can hear you old man. Oh relax. Well, you can just relax as comfy as it looks

420
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,869
Oh, why not? That's

421
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,210
pissing me off

422
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:56,199
Okay, cool

423
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,050
So what does this person do is this do I is this a is there like permanent upgrades?

424
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:04,780
It is a roguelike

425
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,030
There are no permanent upgrades there are

426
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:26,409
Oh, I didn't say I didn't make any reference. Hey room. Hey room use the mirror to grow stronger

427
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,429
Oh, man

428
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:32,429
That's what the clash of clans

429
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,360
Ten dollars for a hundred gems is for

430
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:45,690
Deal bonus attack and special damage when striking foes from behind per rank unlock talents

431
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:49,690
Oh, this is never-ending i'm gonna be so happy about this

432
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:54,489
Restore a small amount of health when you exit a chamber one health. That's not good

433
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,789
Restore 50 percent

434
00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:01,230
Instead of dying when your life is depleted. Why would you not do this immediately?

435
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,260
Oh because the next rank is 500. Okay

436
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,889
I'm probably gonna say this one. No

437
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:12,269
there's

438
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:13,230

00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,230
10 more damage and special damage from behind

440
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:27,949
He fucked it up. Why don't I fuck it up already? So that's why yeah

441
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:32,429
You're not supposed to just beat it quickly in one go. You just you gotta get better and get stronger

442
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:43,340
Despite his lord house repeatedly insisting that he pick everything up speed run speed run

443
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:49,849
Why does every character in this game talk like the new castlevania netflix series

444
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:53,550
Where if you don't have subtitles, you can't understand a fucking word anybody's saying

445
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:03,719
Oh what what happened rewind that and put subtitles on

446
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:20,699
That's pretty morbid dude, you're painfully american

447
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:26,590
No, i'm it's like the audio too like the volume of the speaking is too low

448
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:31,760
It'll be like they'll be like riding on a carriage and talking and the carriage is like

449
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:46,489
I can escape through that pink window there. Well, what's all this need more keys? Oh, this is new weapons

450
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,500
This is a new starting weapon

451
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:54,059
What the fuck is all this stuff?

452
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,610
Okay, this is a law here

453
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,039
Used to unlock a weapon. What is this weapon? I'm doing it. There we go. It's a

454
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:08,219
Heartseeker let's deal something

455
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,690

Who's your supervisor sans no, not every single skeleton is one of those two

461
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:41,210
Just try and beat it out of me. Okay, so let's see

462
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:42,809
so

463
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:44,809
press fire volley

464
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,809
It's a spread

465
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:49,360
That's awesome. Okay

466
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:55,289
Can I just shoot normally? No, you have to you have to hold it so release while flashing for a power shot

467
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,090
So it has to be like that. Okay

468
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,250
You gotta time it

469
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:04,860
Now what's this other one dashing?

470
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,199
Need that again

471
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,199
I can dash to one

472
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:21,039
What'd it say dash plus attack?

473
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
like together

474
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,010
Oh, you can like slide into it

475
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:35,369
Dash attack is faster charge. Is it?

476
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:44,030
Oh it kind of is you're just gonna soft walk the game by killing the skeleton

477
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:49,099
Like

478
00:43:49,099 --> 00:44:01,480
All right. That's pretty good. I like this. I'm gonna try it. Uh

479
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,809
Nico cat gave 50 dollars right now. Thanks for the 50

00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:11,070
Fucking dollars. I say stop saying swears. There's your children watching

481
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,199
Uh, they say germa since you've watched the castlevania show. Do you think you would ever play castlevania on stream?

482
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:18,599
Maybe symphony of the night

483
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:23,550
Oh

484
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,530

Maybe one day. Wait, did I miss anything over here? Is there anything cool I can do here? Just look

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,079

So what can I do? I get an upgrade, right?

491
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,820
Your father's always been rather difficult and he's not so much as cold than quite some time santa

492
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:15,000
Thunder

493
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:23,880
Ooh, we got a blessing thunder your special causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby foes. Uh, yeah

494
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:29,579

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,480
Or your dash causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby foes. I think I want this one

496
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,960
Is it that replaces the thing I had before?

497
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:49,840
That's why right

498
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,239
I love the ball already like i'm gonna i'm only gonna use the ball. I'm not gonna use another weapon for the rest again

499
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:08,170
So wait, isn't that supposed to do your special cause is a bolt to strike nearby foes the blade it's it

500
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:10,809
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I fucking ruin that?

501
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,360
I messed that up

502
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,480
This lore over there. I have what did okay. Look hades

503
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,440
Is in the underworld aries like

504
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,409

505
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:28,010
Hades i'm fighting against my parents all the zeus's kids. Oh

506
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:32,170
Oh, what's his name? Not not not omega. Um

507
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:40,590
Odin all the kids fight against odin. Oh, it's sons versus their parents daughters versus their parents and all these greek and

508
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:47,659
Roman games and like norse it doesn't matter. It's just the sons versus the parents

509
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,960
Look, i'll i'll spell it out even better for a lot of you zoomers in the chat here

510
00:46:54,199 --> 00:47:00,119
Okay, so imagine a youtube thumbnail with a red green and blue sectioned off area

511
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,840
And uh zeus

512
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,480
No, sorry odin loki and thor are doing a colored food challenge video

513
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,809
Where they have to eat only one color of food?

514
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,880
Those videos are insane. That's like the youtube children's content

515
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:40,489
And it's it's weird as hell a lot of these videos they narrate over them themselves talking

516
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,449
The characters the people in the videos don't talk

517
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:53,070
They're narrated over pretending to talk and they all just eat like green foods in like every fucking video

518
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:56,829
It's just oh, we're only gonna eat blue foods today

519
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:09,440
It's every video people think i'm crazy right now and everyone's like what are you talking about?

520
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,440
Oh, yeah, some of you know what i'm talking about

521
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,780
Jesse, what are you talking about? Some of you guys know some of you guys know like the red green blue thumbnail and you're just like

522
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,539
Oh, it's one of these

523
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:41,719
Yeah, well, how would I know that because you know, I gotta I gotta assess the competition

524
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:46,889
You know, what's what are people doing on youtube now? I gotta like see what what I'm gonna see what i'm up against

525
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:59,789
That room was pretty good use your special and look at the damage

526
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:08,800
The same audience. No, it's not the same audience. You guys aren't six

527
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,880
50 damage that wasn't that much

528
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:17,469
40 that's pretty good

529
00:49:17,949 --> 00:49:28,989
Holy shit, that's really good

530
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:42,059
That's so good. I'll tell you I probably would rather have the controller or uh the

531
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:44,480
um

532
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,840
Oh, but it's okay

533
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,010
Your special is the volley. Oh, so what is this one then?

534
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,420
What what is that?

535
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:01,019
All right. I have not been in the trident room before it's a cast

536
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:12,969
Is aim assist on pc2?

537
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,210
Oh, well, I probably turn it off

538
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:21,260
This move is so good. Why even use any other move?

539
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:32,750
It's a trident. It's uncle number two. It's got to be then in the name of hades don't use other moves. I accept this message

540
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:37,159
Don't use any moves

541
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:50,190
ever

542
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,559
It's me

543
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:08,199
Every single god has ever been recorded

544
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:17,550
Nobody knows what the fuck we actually sounded like we actually may have sounded like this

545
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,599
Boy, they're hades you recognize your uncle. Do you not?

546
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:26,880
We've a lot of catching up to do but first things first you get yourself out of that door underworld as for me

547
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,360
I'll see if I can stir things up a bit to cover your advance

548
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:40,300
Don't forget the echo

549
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,820
But I like it's just so it's so simple of a big strong

550
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:47,739
Character that has the control the waves and shit. Of course, they're gonna sound like that

551
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:50,429
But we don't know

552
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:52,110
gain a random assortment of

553
00:51:52,110 --> 00:52:02,619
of jewels

554
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:08,219
Hmm. I think I want this way whether your attack deals more damage and knocks foes away. That's good for the bow

555
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:12,429
Your attack is special is stronger the first 10 seconds in an encounter

556
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:16,030
You do 50 more damage for 10 seconds when you go in a room

557
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:24,170
I mean, that's good, but I kind of want to random like pull the slot machine

558
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,880
Holy shit

559
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,719
See you should be of help. I got five jewels

560
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,639
I got one

561
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,119
Should I get this too tonic? I got a snack. I got another five jewels

562
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,820
Okay, there's more currency. All right, I got it. All right, i'm gonna go in the key room because

563
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:54,030
I want a key

564
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:57,289
What are you aiming at dude?

565
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:02,079
What the hell is he doing?

566
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,119
Whoa, okay. We're good. Now you're gonna lose

567
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,460
I don't think i'm gonna lose

568
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:16,750
What's the range on this?

569
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:28,570
Key this can unlock something back up. This is a boss

570
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:35,230
That's what it means right this boss there. Wait

571
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:53,070
It might be treasures. How can I break that drink out of the cauldron drink out of the cauldron?

572
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,809
Drink out of the cauldron. Where's the drink out of this?

573
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:01,869
Let's see what's in. Whoa gain 29

574
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:05,929
points for health

575
00:54:05,929 --> 00:54:06,809
No

576
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:08,639
That's nothing

577
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,280
You deal 50 damage striking undamaged foes

578
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,920

579
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:17,639
Gain one

580
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:20,400
Okay, so I get an extra special

581
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,500
Probably this one

582
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,659
Yeah, i'm taking that one for six rooms. That's kind of cool

583
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:32,679
All right, let's go

584
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:41,050
Doomstone

585
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:48,670
Doomstone watch it

586
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:04,219
Whoa

587
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:07,960
Give me way

588
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,960
You gotta break these fucking things. That's how they bounce

589
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:26,409
Oh bunch him up bunch him up

Less giant evil crystal then I did actually right here. I did took two damage. That's pretty good

592
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,840
Wait gift minus one

593
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,920
Why am I gonna lose my uh potion? I don't get it

594
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,449
Don't give it

595
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:09,849
Look, what does that do?

596
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:19,400
You give it to zeus. Okay, but what does it do though? Should I do it and see what happens? Don't do it

597
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:22,119
You don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. It's the dating sim

598
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,840
Well, do I want to date zeus or do I want to date Poseidon?

599
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:28,409
There are more than two characters

600
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:28,809
Okay

601
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:37,210
Like why am I going do I would I rather date zeus or Poseidon zeus and Poseidon are both sitting in their living room watching this

602
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,329
From the clouds and they're both going uh, dude

603
00:56:40,409 --> 00:56:44,320
Like what is he talking about like he thinks he's gonna just like date one of us

604
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:50,539
Is that what he thinks he's doing down here? Um, so I wish one of us should go down there and tell him

605
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:53,099
I'm gonna save it

606
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,039
Holy shit, that's pretty good. All right

607
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:02,559
Do I date zeus or do I date Poseidon which one? Uh

608
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,440
There's lots of single people in the world of valhalla

609
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:25,719
None of us have been married for 4000 years, dude. I don't like that. I like this one. I like this one

610
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,480
Wrong valhalla, whatever, you know, but it's heaven and what they're all it's just heaven

611
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:35,920
heaven

612
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:42,380
Lost souls with nowhere left wrong religion. It's not a religion

613
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,389
Into odious forms which defy description

614
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:58,840
It is no, it's not what do you think it is?

615
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:03,150
It was a thing that they were these real people

616
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,880
I'm kidding. I'm fucking kidding. Relax

617
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:23,360
I'm kidding. All right. Let me play my game please before everybody yells at me

618
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:33,449
I'm liking the lightning. I should have dated zeus

619
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,679
Stop saying that

620
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:49,769
The bow is so much fun

621
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:51,530
I've ruined the game for myself

622
00:58:51,530 --> 00:59:05,610
Because i'm not why would I put somebody said i'll get the spear. No, why why would I ever?

623
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,610
Oh shit

624
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:19,400
Too much fun game ruined. All right. I got four more encounters with 50 more damage to foes

625
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,530
Break everything

626
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:28,969
All right, somebody in chat, please correct me. Is this a break everything game?

627
00:59:29,449 --> 00:59:31,449
Could there be something in there or is this a waste of time?

628
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:37,550
No, no, not even okay. It may maybe eventually. Okay

629
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:52,010
Some jars have money. All right, who's that?

630
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:58,519
I don't have to deflect on my dash anymore

631
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:18,920
Anymore, here we go

632
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:26,699
Oh, what am I thinking turn off auto aim it sucks

633
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,449
All right, I will

634
01:00:29,449 --> 01:00:31,769
I feel like it's helping me a little bit though. I really do

635
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:54,969
Shit, hold on because see how it's like automatically going right at some people sometimes

636
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,079
But other times it doesn't

637
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:08,650
Sucks turn it off. I can't turn it off right now. Oh, yeah again

638
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:25,769
Aim assist turn it back on turn it back on not good. It's not good. Not good

639
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:34,489
Omega l you suck. No, it's a controller aim. Don't you get it? Don't you understand?

640
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,130
Oh what there's a reward in here? Oh

641
01:01:42,909 --> 01:01:46,170
plus 12

642
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,530
Using mouse. No, but I like moving around. That's this is the worst thing

643
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:54,010
You know what I need. This is what I need. I seriously need this

644
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:59,789
I'm dead serious about this. I'm willing to put forth the effort to make this happen. I

645
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:05,309
Like to move around in games with the thumb and the controller and I love the face buttons to do everything

646
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:12,349
I don't like WASD and moving around that way, but the mouse is so much better to aim

647
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:16,619
I love the mouse more than I like aiming with an analog or most people do

648
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:20,539
So here's the solution that I have if I get an eye tracker

649
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:27,079
Can I use my eyes as the mouse and use my controller as the keyboard?

650
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,780
You know what I'm saying?

651
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,940
So then I can I could get best of both worlds

652
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:45,550
So my eyes with an eye tracker actually are the mouse and I can still move around with the thumb pad and use the face buttons

653
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,110
That wouldn't work, but it would be so much better

654
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:55,449

01:04:33,389 --> 01:04:36,909

670
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:40,599
Oh

671
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:42,199

01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:08,139
A paragraph of information here as someone who owns a thrust master

678
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,960
And has it set up in left-handed mode using a joystick and a mouse at the same time really depends on the game

679
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,639
Sometimes games just won't use a joystick and keyboard. Wait, is that a real thing?

680
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:21,000
I feel like this is like a meme and you just talked about like I just that's like a zirconov thing

Okay

687
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,719
That's what it's called. I thought I really didn't want to read the rest of the message

688
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:57,550
It's a flight stick

689
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:01,079

It's real. Okay. All right

691
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:05,519

01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,760
If I gift him this

696
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,079

Yeah, a lot of those oculus commercials they move around you see how they move around those commercials like super fluid and like tons of movement

755
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:41,359

756
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:45,079
How much more would you think it was interesting for like an oculus

757
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:50,520
If that person was like doing the moves and like dancing around and stuff and they smashed into their walls and into like a shelf

784
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:09,819
This is exactly what i'm talking about

785
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:16,140
You nailed it. You absolutely nailed it, but you put no question marks. You fucked it up. You fucked it up

786
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:19,800
You gotta write

787
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:29,869
On there you have to write on there and it's 10.01. Perfect. Take the question marks off and say

789
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:42,510
Food eating challenge and I gotta tell you this too

790
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:47,789
When they eat the broccoli and the vegetables they puke and stuff

791
01:16:50,199 --> 01:16:55,560
What are they teaching our children? The blue candy and the red candy is delicious. Yeah, eat it

792
01:16:55,640 --> 01:17:01,279
Eat it every day they eat the whole bottle but once it once it gets to the broccoli it's like

793
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:13,930
Like what the hell is going on

794
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:17,210
I don't understand like the primary colors shit

795
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:21,609
Why is every one of these videos blue green red and yellow?

796
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:32,590
And they all play the same sound effects, too. They play like

797
01:17:34,909 --> 01:17:36,510
Every five seconds

798
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:54,890
There's like mutating our children's brains. I love the fact that you've watched them. Of course I have

799
01:17:55,449 --> 01:18:08,909
It's always primary colors. It's always like half the room is like green half the room is like orange

800
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:14,569
Just sit your kids in front of sesame street, please

801
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:19,050
Do not sit them in front of like the bath salt fucking youtube kids channels

Oh, how did you sit them in front of this stream? Do not do that either

Please

806
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:09,180
Um, I have to say this because it's a failed german 985 experiment that I was gonna do years ago and I told

807
01:19:09,739 --> 01:19:12,810
One person about it years ago

808
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:16,170
While I was just streaming I wasn't gonna say anything about it

809
01:19:16,409 --> 01:19:21,390
I was going to make a kids youtube channel and make just awesome incredibly good

810
01:19:21,949 --> 01:19:25,630
Like wholesome children's content on youtube on a new channel

I'm gonna see if I can get slime to be more popular than me

814
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:42,119
My goal was to have like a billion view a day kids youtube channel. That was good shit

815
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:47,479

Only a few cookies eaten every video, right?

818
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,960
It wouldn't be like squeeze the sugar into your mouth like half of these fucking shows

819
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,880
We would sing songs about like broccoli, but they would be good. They would be good fucking songs

820
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,920
It wouldn't be shitty

821
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:14,359
I was gonna try to be like a billion view a day youtube kids channel and see if anybody found it

822
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:26,220
You thought quasimodo was a was greek. That's why you hire people to be able to I what I you you hire like

823
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:31,880
People to come in like educators you bring in educators and they hey

824
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,960
What's a good lesson plan that we could do if we could have some fun characters do fun cool shit, right?

825
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:39,960
I want cool shit bring in a bunch of like teachers

826
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:48,250
Guidance counselors like all of them. Sesame street does that too. That's right, but I want to do it as well

827
01:20:54,079 --> 01:21:04,220
Oh, wait, what's this? Is it free? Is this just for free?

828
01:21:06,649 --> 01:21:10,250
Is this is this like the bread at outback steakhouse? Am I gonna get charged for this?

829
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:15,340
Okay, good. I don't want to

830
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,279
I'm also by the way implying that you don't get charged for the bread at outback steakhouse not that you do

831
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:27,479
sell sell

832
01:21:28,329 --> 01:21:31,930
Oh

833
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:36,250
Oh, I can sell all the things I have on me. I don't want to sell

834
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:40,909
How do I go back shop?

835
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:46,649
Oh, I don't have any money

836
01:21:46,649 --> 01:21:47,770
Bye. Bye. Bye

837
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:57,680
At this time of come oh

838
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:04,569
Going up the tower that wing is a weak choice. So this is area too. How many areas are in the don't tell me

839
01:22:05,289 --> 01:22:09,819
I can't believe I did the fucking gnome reference

840
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:17,159
What the hell wasn't this whole expanse once lush and green I was so confident too

841
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:22,760
I was like this is so easy to not do the once verdant plains of asphodel are now engulfed in scintillating flame

842
01:22:23,159 --> 01:22:25,159
Having been flooded by the river flaggathon

843
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:31,640
Whose hideously superheated contents could bring death swiftly even to those resistant to most eat

844
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:37,239
I'm gonna die to lava a hundred percent only flame resistant pump flame proof. I mean new contract. I want a new one

845
01:22:38,649 --> 01:22:41,369
I die to lava then I have to go

846
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,319
one community sub

847
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:48,649
But if I don't die to lava for the next hour, I shave a hundred million off the debt

848
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,239
No deal. Okay fine

849
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:04,159
a hundred subs no way

850
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,300
All right. What what is this?

851
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:17,630
This is locked. Oh, this is a new hub world. Here's one of these

852
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:23,369
But the lava though this guy shoots love at you. Oh, you can't hit him

853
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,630
slam dancers

854
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:32,090
Slam dancers

855
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,359
Not as strong as I was before that's for sure

856
01:23:44,460 --> 01:24:00,569
They slam and they dance. Well, that was bad. Don't get near me. Oh shit. That's

857
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:09,880
Oh, I see why you can die to lava. Okay, you can you can actually fall in that lava. Oh shit

858
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:27,420
I'm not doing any damage. I need a new weapon or something. I need like a new weapon

859
01:24:27,659 --> 01:24:30,939
I need like a you need a new weapon not like a new weapon

860
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:35,500
God, you're supposed to be teaching children soon get your vocabulary higher

861
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,369
Oh, that was 41 bucks

862
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:47,880
Soon

863
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:52,989
Oh nice another hundred

864
01:24:52,989 --> 01:24:57,289
So these are open now. All right. Do I want the key or do I wait? I don't want the key

865
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:00,810
I want the extra to go

866
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:02,829
Oi

867
01:25:02,829 --> 01:25:05,770
Why can you fall off like that?

868
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:16,329
um, okay

869
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:18,890
Burn fingers

870
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:20,729
slam dancers

871
01:25:20,729 --> 01:25:27,050
What else we got?

872
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:42,010
Finger lickers

873
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:47,210
I gotta go across

874
01:25:47,210 --> 01:26:00,760
KFC. Oh shit. This is a new enemy. What is it? Nice

875
01:26:01,479 --> 01:26:03,640
On my authority belly itchers

876
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:11,609
Do I want the shop? I don't think I have enough money for anything. Do I I guess I kind of do

877
01:26:20,029 --> 01:26:22,029
These are hobbit last names

878
01:26:22,489 --> 01:26:27,390
Sort of all right. Do I want Poseidon or do I want power up?

879
01:26:28,029 --> 01:26:34,270
I know searing flame and ashes of the river flaggathon mean nothing to the ferryman keron

880
01:26:34,829 --> 01:26:40,750
Who travels all the waters of the underworld want the fruit the dead you want Poseidon and all their fineries

881
01:26:41,710 --> 01:26:42,909
You want uncle?

882
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:48,430
I do enjoy dead people's final race. Sure. I'll get i'll take the uncle power up

883
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:51,800
Don't spend it all in one place

884
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:59,199
Tell me little nephew strewn among the inventories of their most disturbing river boatman. That means you win my blessing

885
01:27:04,090 --> 01:27:06,079
Oh

886
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:10,649
Wait, why would I no give me this?

887
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:16,119
Yes, make some waves

888
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:23,930
I got another gift too. Perfect. I have two gifts and I have a ton of that currency and i'm gonna get even more of that

889
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:27,130
Currency, let's go. I'll pay for that hundred currency now

890
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:30,090
And I can buy the power up too

891
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:43,260
Kind of have to do that

892
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:48,079
121 damage every time they attack I have to I can give the gift now

893
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,960
I'm gonna I'm gonna see what it does

894
01:27:51,789 --> 01:27:53,600
Here take it

895
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,560
What does it do?

896
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,069
Here on you've been such a reassuring sight. I thought I'd offer you a token of my gratitude. I have another one

897
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:10,460
Wait, you don't have to give me something in return. It was a gift. Oh wait a gift. You're insisting aren't you?

898
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,500
That's one hell. I don't know what to say mate

899
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:18,920

900
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,920

It's a keepsake. Oh

01:28:34,859 --> 01:28:40,699
Keepsakes not gonna keep me alive. It was a bone hourglass

903
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,800
What the fuck i'm so stupid. I was looking at chat and I see it. Oh, it's okay. Let's go

904
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:54,890

All right, come on jolt him that I didn't know exploded

Oh

908
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:34,590
Don't god damn it. I don't like the lava place. It's too hard to die. It's too easy to die

909
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:48,359
Get away from me

910
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:49,880
Get away from me

911
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:55,960
Asphodel is easy to die in. Yeah

01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,939
Your special deals 40 more damage

920
01:30:27,659 --> 01:30:29,659
I don't even use the special feel like it sucks

921
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:31,500

922
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:38,720
I'll take this one special is good

923
01:30:39,609 --> 01:30:41,609

01:30:45,369 --> 01:30:46,729
Got me this far

01:30:46,729 --> 01:30:52,539
Special is y. Oh, what is b?

928
01:30:53,659 --> 01:30:56,859
What is that gem the weird like gem that I throw out?

929
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:02,560
What is the uh, the your sim has zero in every category icon?

930
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,000
What does it do?

931
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,359
It just gets cast. Okay

932
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,680
Well, that's actually really great then

933
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,119
Use it

934
01:31:16,119 --> 01:31:18,119
Yeah, see but it okay

935
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:22,760
It just shoots out this little blob that does 50 damage and it takes a lot. Do you have to aim it?

936
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,239
I gotta pee

937
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:32,090
You need an augment you have to upgrade it. Okay

938
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:41,470
That's a problem. I can't oh shit. Okay, I can't destroy those

939
01:31:42,189 --> 01:31:46,800
Get away from me

940
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,350
Get away from me

941
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:52,350
Thank god. I didn't just say the thing I was gonna say

942
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:19,840
Oh

943
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:25,149
Watch it watch out

944
01:32:26,569 --> 01:32:30,810
I need to slow. I just shut up. It's not that big of a deal. You touched the lava once

945
01:32:39,979 --> 01:32:49,520
Cool until next time gigantic gorgon head olympus. I accept this message. Come on zeus

946
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,619
This one's rare

947
01:32:52,619 --> 01:32:55,600
Finally, I have a new cast your cast is a chain

948
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,090
lightning

949
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:00,569
After you take damage your foe is struck by lightning. Uh

950
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,680
Your dash causes a lightning bolt. This is good, too

951
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:08,890
But again, I actually get a cast

952
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:16,510
Yeah, give me a cast. Let me see what the hell it even does

953
01:33:17,979 --> 01:33:19,979
Yeah. All right. Cool. I actually have a move now

954
01:33:29,659 --> 01:33:31,659
Shit, you gotta get it to hit to prog

955
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:36,329
proc

956
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:43,720
I mean, it's not that great. I do that much damage by just shooting somebody once

957
01:33:44,359 --> 01:34:01,199
Anybody else feel like he's saying things that I say but way more collected way more cool

958
01:34:02,649 --> 01:34:04,649
Really? You want to go?

959
01:34:04,729 --> 01:34:15,210
He's just way more interesting. He's way more soft spoken than I am

960
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:19,880
I actually get hit by that

961
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:22,159
He's hotter than you

962
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:25,079
Okay

963
01:34:25,079 --> 01:34:26,359
Oh no

964
01:34:26,359 --> 01:34:27,960
What do I do?

965
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,909
This guy's hotter than me

966
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:49,770
I have so much of this currency. I'm gonna be a level up 10 times

967
01:34:57,689 --> 01:34:59,930
Wait, what else is there?

968
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:03,609
Ooh. All right. Do I want no, I don't have enough money. Let's get the uh pomegranate

969
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:21,199
Okay, I have a feeling i'm probably not gonna beat the boss because i'm feeling i'm not doing as much damage as I should be

970
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,840
Why does this look so easy to take this?

971
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:33,310
Being traversed the flaming river flaggathon to gain this vantage point relentless sagrious must now confront a foe of unimaginable savagery

972
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,210
Who lies ahead?

973
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:37,689
Awaiting patiently. It's time to strike

974
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:45,159
All right. I'm clicking it

975
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,239
This is hades

976
01:35:49,239 --> 01:36:00,239
not hades

977
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,239
Wrong link how?

978
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:10,439
As i'm being spammed

979
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,239
It took me a second to

980
01:36:20,909 --> 01:36:21,630
uh

981
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:28,079
Let me get this one out ancient tablet

982
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:31,520
I love how uh cnn politics is still a thing

983
01:36:32,779 --> 01:36:41,819
A thousand years from now apparently wait to spoil the surprise old man. God's grant me strength

984
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:46,380
I have to do it. I don't even care what the other ones are. I want this. I want to get this to 200 damage

985
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,930
He doesn't get it

986
01:36:55,930 --> 01:37:00,649
No, wait, so that's not supposed to be like I that's lore about me like a thousand years in the future

987
01:37:00,729 --> 01:37:05,689

988
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,279

997
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,800
It's not that big of a deal. Just relax

998
01:37:54,840 --> 01:38:13,130
Plus we have like thorns on him

999
01:38:13,130 --> 01:38:17,760
Make sure I gotta keep this on him because they'll hurt himself every time and this is this guy's a joke

1000
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:30,640
Oh phase two. Oh, well, never mind. I spoke too soon

1005
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:21,760

1007
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:30,439

1008
01:39:30,439 --> 01:39:32,439
Oh you fucking controller aim dog. Shit

1009
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:53,659
I gotta use that to my advantage

1010
01:39:53,739 --> 01:39:54,619
Shit

1011
01:39:54,619 --> 01:40:00,960

Hope you had a good stream

1019
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:08,119
What was it doing today? The game's too easy. I took a lot of guts

1020
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,100
planet coaster

1021
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:14,699
Oh cool, is that game good still did they update it at all? Is it like fun?

1022
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:20,649
Give me something. I remember I tried to get a gorilla to like

1023
01:42:21,289 --> 01:42:24,090
Punch people in the face to like climb out of the enclosure and kill people

1024
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:27,050
Has it gone any different from there?

1025
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:38,800
I've let it one time for like four hours, uh, but welcome guys. They're playing hades first time playing ever

1026
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:44,239
First trying the second boss, which everyone told me guaranteed. He dies on the second boss

1027
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:48,250
Sometimes you have to show them what you're capable of

1028
01:42:52,199 --> 01:42:58,880
Sing the raid song

1029
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:05,039
They're leaving because you're not singing the raid song. No that they're they're sticking around until at least an hour from now

1030
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:08,909
I can heal

1031
01:43:08,909 --> 01:43:10,989
I kind of is all right. Is it weird that I want to die?

1032
01:43:12,189 --> 01:43:14,189
So I can spend some of this currency

1033
01:43:15,659 --> 01:43:20,510
Sing or we're gonna leave

1034
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:21,920

1037
01:43:32,859 --> 01:43:37,579
This is what happens when you make me sing and make me do this don't tell me to do that anymore

1038
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,699
Don't tell me to do that anymore. That was pretty fun to say

1039
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:45,979
He's clapping his ass. I'm just shaking really hard

1040
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,600

Beatbox the pepsi man song. I don't even know what that is the fields of elysium

1047
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:34,729

1048
01:44:35,689 --> 01:44:37,689
It's you escaped asafoel

1049
01:44:40,489 --> 01:44:47,050
I kind of want to die the rare heavenly splendors of elysium reserved for only the most great of mortal souls

1050
01:44:47,449 --> 01:44:51,289
Spread forth luxuriantly all about the fire-stepping prince

1051
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:54,090
You escaped as a whole

1052
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:57,289
Hey, how would you spell that asshole?

1053
01:45:01,289 --> 01:45:07,880
Uh, which one of these do I want?

1054
01:45:08,279 --> 01:45:13,840
Probably pomegranate. That's jolt though, right?

1055
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:16,479
Jolt is pomegranate plus

1056
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:38,590
Oh, I can't wait. You didn't hurt him that just bounced around like wow that hurt

1057
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:44,399
Is that egg shooting me?

1058
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:50,300
it is

1059
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:51,739
Kill this thing

1060
01:45:51,739 --> 01:45:56,720
Can't why would I get close to a guy with a sword? That's what I want to know

1061
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:03,369
Do you have to kill them before they go back to this sword?

1062
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,500
Oh

1063
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,500
I just walked right into that. I'm okay

1064
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:26,000
Oh my fucking god. I these things stupid. I hate them. I want to die. Anyways, I seriously do

1065
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:29,279

1066
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:45,840
He's throwing now. No, i'm not i'm not i have jolt six

1067
01:46:46,479 --> 01:46:52,359
I can't throw

1068
01:46:52,359 --> 01:46:59,420
Definitely the health is diminishing returns

1069
01:47:09,319 --> 01:47:13,640
That's doing anything

1070
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:15,640
All right. All right. That was free. I guess

1071
01:47:19,819 --> 01:47:21,819
Am I stunning him somehow?

1072
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,340
I'm stun locking. Oh, that's cool

1073
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:39,039

1074
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:46,189
I think can these hurt me. I feel like these things can hurt you

1075
01:47:46,909 --> 01:47:58,439
Yeah, they can of course they can

1076
01:47:58,439 --> 01:48:07,390
Ow, all right. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Give me that extra health

1077
01:48:11,069 --> 01:48:15,390
Thanatos waiting room thanatos is in this game

1078
01:48:15,949 --> 01:48:18,250

1080
01:48:36,619 --> 01:48:38,619
Great shields you gotta hit him from behind

1081
01:48:38,939 --> 01:48:44,250
Don't worry. I got jolt on him

1082
01:48:44,329 --> 01:48:48,489
Yeah, if who cares just jolt him you actually just hit me with that. I'm fucking furious

1083
01:48:58,989 --> 01:49:00,590

Oh that hurt. What are those? Oh, the spears hurt you on that side

1088
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:34,840
You get it. Oh fuck you you did

01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:45,260
No

1091
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:57,310
All right. Come here. How am I not behind you?

1092

1094
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:28,170
Don't want it. Don't care. I accept this message

Okay, your attack and specialist stronger for 10 seconds. Yeah, I don't like the timer any

1096
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:46,460

01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:47,899
darkness or

1098
01:50:47,899 --> 01:50:49,850
Obol award

1099
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:55,930
Is worth way more. I mean, I don't have anything on my dash. I might as well get it

1100
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:02,750
Yeah, it's good for the bow. We're good. All right, so this is um zeus

Something new a mirror a mirror

I don't I want to see who it is

1104
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:22,699
Mini boss let's do it from the bowels of hell. This is not your place

1105
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:28,939
Agreed on both counts just passing through so if you'll excuse me

1106
01:51:29,899 --> 01:51:38,560
I will not be such a contest neither will I I don't know why I think that's funny

1107
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:44,430
Wait about the champion of elysium. You're the bull of minos. I can't imagine who's even stronger than you

1108
01:51:44,989 --> 01:51:46,989
Is it heracles? Tell me it's heracles

1109
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:49,390
You just act did you say hercules wrong?

1110
01:51:49,789 --> 01:51:59,229
You talk to my destroyed come get destroyed. All right, let's go

1111
01:52:00,109 --> 01:52:12,890
Let me see what he does first

1112
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:14,479
charges

1113
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:19,659
What the fuck where do I go? All right, that's what I do

1114
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:41,260
Hmm, holy shit, he's got a three combo

1115
01:52:41,979 --> 01:52:49,390
Where is he?

1116
01:52:52,350 --> 01:53:04,039
I'm good

1117
01:53:06,359 --> 01:53:08,600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What do you want me to say?

1118
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:11,159
It's stressful

1119
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:22,810
How would you go the wrong fucking way?

1120
01:53:24,010 --> 01:53:27,130
I'm sorry. I have to mute. I have to be and i'm not gonna stop doing that

1121
01:53:27,930 --> 01:53:41,439
What the fuck what the fuck it's me grandpa

1122
01:53:42,729 --> 01:53:44,970
I come out under extreme stressful scenario

1123
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:48,760
Kind of like your what some of your favorite tv shows and movies

1124
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:54,960
You know when the main character has like something else going on where like he turns into another person when he's under a lot of stress

1125
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:56,960
like lucario

1126
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:05,279
That's me

1127
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:11,340
But I what he did he taunted. I don't know what the fuck that was. He taunted me

1128
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,380
And he had like a shield on him. I thought he was gonna summon enemies

1129
01:54:14,699 --> 01:54:19,210
I thought he was gonna be like fight by minions and never I don't know

1130
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:23,439
Whatever. I wanted to die anyways. I got 140 gold. It's rather hard

1131
01:54:32,539 --> 01:54:37,920
Dead

1132
01:54:54,670 --> 01:54:56,670
He just jumps and swings

1133
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:59,020
I had it down for a little while

1134
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:02,890
But when he started when he did the shielded taunt, I thought something else was gonna happen

1135
01:55:04,829 --> 01:55:06,989
Do not question my power hades

1136
01:55:07,869 --> 01:55:11,710
Your son was bound to be discovered the closer he came to the surface

1137
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:17,390
The olympians are give to the dog. They have a distant relative thinking about it and bid him welcome to their mountain

1138
01:55:18,109 --> 01:55:19,630
That is all

1139
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:21,630
Thinking about it very limited

1140
01:55:21,789 --> 01:55:33,500
I feel like that's too easy though. Do not speak to me about this. I've seen their evens firsthand done this mistake

1141
01:55:33,739 --> 01:55:36,159
Give it a skelly

1142
01:55:36,159 --> 01:55:38,800
You don't think about this to me of foolish mistakes

1143
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,239
You cannot change the course that has been set

1144
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:45,560
Try all you like

1145
01:55:46,359 --> 01:55:48,359
It's

1146
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:53,149
The hell is this

1147
01:55:53,149 --> 01:55:55,149
I gotta let me pee i'll be right back

1148
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:02,810
Uh, sorry, I did the thing you fill your cup with ice and the ice comes out way too fast

1149
02:01:03,449 --> 02:01:07,210
And four or five ice cubes just blow out all over you and go underneath the fridge

1150
02:01:08,539 --> 02:01:11,739
And you're just like I I don't want like five ice cubes under the fridge

1151
02:01:11,979 --> 02:01:22,460
So I went under there with like a straw and I was trying to get them all out. I got him

1152

He's rich. He's got a rich fridge

1153
02:01:34,359 --> 02:01:41,979
What are you talking about isn't every refrigerator made after like 1995 have an ice maker in it

1154
02:01:47,149 --> 02:01:52,890
What wait what?

1155
02:01:52,890 --> 02:02:03,239
It's just it's just a regular fridge that has ice in it. I don't have a smart fridge

1156
02:02:03,319 --> 02:02:04,920
I don't want that thing listening to me

1157
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:12,090
You know how many weird noises I make in the morning when I open the fridge

1158
02:02:12,409 --> 02:02:17,449
I open the door and my stomach and my body just makes sounds just like

02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:28,800
Head chambers. Yeah, this is just cool stuff

02:05:51,949 --> 02:05:55,500
Over half of the game's upgrade require pool scrying

1195
02:06:01,079 --> 02:06:06,189
Best go all the way now. Leave me be and don't think you're gonna be so lucky next we meet out there

1196
02:06:09,689 --> 02:06:11,529

1204
02:06:58,539 --> 02:06:59,819
thousand

1205
02:06:59,819 --> 02:07:01,840
gems

1206
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:08,000
The son of the god of the dead shall someday break free from the realm in which he was born as a thousand gems

1207
02:07:09,979 --> 02:07:20,329
How how do I track that the son of the god of the dead shall someday? Okay, so wait, I need to meet

1208
02:07:21,130 --> 02:07:21,850
uh

1209
02:07:21,850 --> 02:07:25,840
The other gods I need I have ten kids

1210
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:33,609
All right, this is just meeting other characters. This is unlocking moves and using them

1211
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:39,630
Is unlocking all the weapons?

1212
02:07:40,029 --> 02:07:50,430
Okay, I just just play the game. All right, just play the game and eventually you'll get stuff get it got it

1213
02:07:58,890 --> 02:08:00,090
Here we go

1214
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:01,310
All right

1215
02:08:01,310 --> 02:08:06,729
I got a lot of money perform one additional dash in quick succession. That's incredible

1216
02:08:08,039 --> 02:08:17,390
That's just bang bang

1217
02:08:17,390 --> 02:08:20,670
And this is just more damage when striking from behind

1218
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:27,359
That's huge

1219
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:29,359
Okay, uh, i'm gonna do this

1220
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:32,800
Should I do this though? I can do that. How many times can I do this?

1221
02:08:34,670 --> 02:08:39,369
Okay, get if it was like five that'd be really good. All right, i'm doing it

1222
02:08:39,449 --> 02:08:42,250
I'm doing three I get three health every room and I have enough to do this once

1223
02:08:42,489 --> 02:08:43,149
So there you go

1224
02:08:43,149 --> 02:08:47,630
I have 20 more damage from behind and I heal three health every time I go in a new room and I can dash twice

1225
02:08:48,109 --> 02:08:54,090
It's just that changes everything that this actually changes everything

1226
02:09:03,369 --> 02:09:05,369
Skelly, all right skelly

1227
02:09:05,689 --> 02:09:08,600
Let's talk skelly. You look like you know your way around tartarus

1228
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:11,880
Plant some of this ancient titan blood out there and I was looking to score some more

1229
02:09:12,680 --> 02:09:17,850
All right, you come to the right place regarding that there pal

1230
02:09:17,930 --> 02:09:20,489
Yeah, I kind of want to gift this guy there that can find his stuff

1231
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:25,449
Once you get all the way through tartarus with one that's all the blood you're gonna get for the time being anyhow

1232
02:09:26,649 --> 02:09:28,090
I like his artwork

1233
02:09:28,090 --> 02:09:34,279
Am I supposed to keep track of which weapons i've earned these with then it's just how I feel like when I take the vr helmet off

1234
02:09:35,579 --> 02:09:44,430
There's always the invention of writing stuff down. You'll figure something out. All right, i'm gonna give you a gift skelly. Take it

1235
02:09:45,069 --> 02:09:50,779
For you mate thought you might get a kick out of this for me pal

1236
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:55,100
Awful nice. You're just awful nice. But guess what? I got this for you

1237
02:09:55,579 --> 02:09:57,899
Tick fatalia in this stand it deals the deal

1238
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:00,829
What is it?

1239
02:10:00,829 --> 02:10:02,430
plus one

1240
02:10:02,430 --> 02:10:05,659
lucky tooth

1241
02:10:05,659 --> 02:10:07,500
Check the display case

1242
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:10,829
Got something new. Oh

1243
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:21,529
Items from the well of charon have durations increased by plus four encounters. What's a well of charon?

1244
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:27,420
Oh, that's the shop instead of six

1245
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:36,880
It's 10 automatically restore up to 50 health when your life total is depleted. What?

1246
02:10:37,439 --> 02:10:44,109
Wait, don't I I want that I can only have one right?

1247
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:51,130
Should help don't I already have one so that means I can die twice

1248
02:10:51,689 --> 02:10:58,880
I have two extra lives about that son, but why would I ever take this off for any reason?

1249
02:10:59,439 --> 02:11:03,449
All right, you know what? Let's go back to sword. Let's try it. You know, let's do it

1250
02:11:06,170 --> 02:11:14,880
You can charge it too, right?

1251
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:26,729
The spear sucks. I don't even have enough keys. All right. This is gonna be a key run. Thanks for the extra life

1252
02:11:28,359 --> 02:11:30,920
I'm only gonna I want I want keys because I want whatever these are

1253
02:11:33,710 --> 02:11:51,529
Key run that was not of reference just because it's in another just because there are keys in other video games

1254
02:11:52,409 --> 02:12:06,720
I doubtless it's the died alice encounter hammer. Okay, your special hits a wider area and deals more damage

1255
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:09,479
That's I like that

1256
02:12:09,479 --> 02:12:14,399
Your attack fire is a wave that pierces foes. It does okay. So it's like link at full health

1257
02:12:15,359 --> 02:12:17,579
I like that

1258
02:12:17,579 --> 02:12:19,470
Holy shit

1259
02:12:19,470 --> 02:12:21,180
um

1260
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:24,060
Why would I that's 200 more damage and more

1261
02:12:26,489 --> 02:12:29,689
All right, so this is this is a key and lunge at people run

1262
02:12:30,409 --> 02:12:39,609
I was only doing 30 damage

1263
02:12:39,609 --> 02:12:42,890
Wait, I guess 200 of 15 is not that big of a deal

1264
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:46,220
Wrong move isn't that's not thrust

1265
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:49,500
Now that's thrust

1266
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:57,119
Trust is the third hit. Okay commosed of such innumerable ever shifting interlocking chambers

1267
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:06,010
The underworld is all but guarantees the dead shall there remain good thing i'm not dead this game's really good

1268
02:13:06,329 --> 02:13:09,930
I'm all right. I understand why i'm like a bandwagon streamer

1269
02:13:10,409 --> 02:13:13,529
I got nominated for game of the year and all of a sudden. Yeah, me too. I'm gonna play it

1270
02:13:14,649 --> 02:13:16,649
It's very good. It's very very good

1271
02:13:17,130 --> 02:13:19,770
So far hold on. I remember where we have a scale here

1272
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:23,630
We have a like stock market line

1273
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:25,550
right now

1274
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:28,109
I will say this is

1275
02:13:28,109 --> 02:13:31,789
This is like an this is like an 89 right now. It's right there

1276
02:13:32,590 --> 02:13:34,590
Which it's still going up. We'll see

1277
02:13:42,909 --> 02:13:46,109
That does so much more damage if you hit people from behind too. Oh, yeah

1278
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:54,720
Now there's no reason to sell yet. Why what do you mean sell? There's no why there's no reason to do that

1279
02:13:55,439 --> 02:14:08,359
I'm treating this like a bow and I can't here we go

1280
02:14:15,229 --> 02:14:17,800
Quick buy buy

1281
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:18,920
All right

1282
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:20,039
uh

1283
02:14:20,039 --> 02:14:22,920
Extra health or the mirror

1284
02:14:23,479 --> 02:14:36,430
I like health though. Oh, i'm drinking coffee new enemy

1285
02:14:37,149 --> 02:14:38,510
brimstones

1286
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:41,470
What do they do?

1287
02:14:41,470 --> 02:14:43,630
All right. Hey, that's very slow. I got it

1288
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:53,260
Very slow. It's dodgeable very dodgeable

1289
02:14:53,739 --> 02:14:58,029
It was two was that 270 damage?

1290
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:13,340
That was a shitload

1291
02:15:13,340 --> 02:15:15,340
Well, sure then oh, it's

1292
02:15:22,430 --> 02:15:25,069
Going look you have got to get here with the rest of us already

1293
02:15:25,069 --> 02:15:30,109
We've been saving you a spot. Let me see what I can do make life a little sweeter for you in the meantime

1294
02:15:30,909 --> 02:15:39,319
All right, this is the person that I want to give all the gifts to your attack inflicts hangover hangover damage for every half second

1295
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:43,180
nice

1296
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:45,180
Your special inflicts hangover

1297
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:55,920
Your cast lobs a large explosive that bursts into festive fog. So this is a stun. I kind of just want the hangover damage

1298
02:15:56,479 --> 02:16:06,159
For this one, that's five. How long does it last for four seconds? So that's five ten fifteen

1299
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:23,369
That's 20 extra damage in two seconds things up around here. I like to get the big big big groups

1300
02:16:23,850 --> 02:16:31,050
You got the worst one omega lol worst one for you. Not for me

1301
02:16:31,770 --> 02:16:34,010
Worst one best one for me. You suck

1302
02:16:34,809 --> 02:16:39,290
They give you three options. I don't know how to correct. It's how you want to build your character

1303
02:16:40,170 --> 02:16:58,540
Uh, look at I wouldn't have killed that guy if I didn't have this one selected would I i'm so glad there's no

1304
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:06,829
Mana or anything in this game?

1305
02:17:06,829 --> 02:17:08,829
Oh, that's good

1306
02:17:09,159 --> 02:17:22,829
The sword's good, too

1307
02:17:22,829 --> 02:17:28,090
What reference man? Oh, he says mana. Oh, okay

1308
02:17:30,989 --> 02:17:38,000
mana

1309
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:43,870
Oh, oh, I thought that was beetle. I love the sound

1310
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:50,780
Can I call pests?

1311
02:17:58,090 --> 02:18:03,610
Don't let him do that

1312
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:04,889
Wow

1313
02:18:04,889 --> 02:18:09,610
Wow, I just almost got shocked by that. I was gonna kill by that. Wow. That was close

1314
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:24,510
Wow, I almost got murdered there

1315
02:18:25,629 --> 02:18:30,440
All right boss and more gems. It's not a reference we're talking about. I didn't know it's not

1316
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:41,260
How is me saying? Wow, I almost got killed. How's that a reference? I'm gonna get a gift. Oh shit

1317
02:18:41,340 --> 02:18:50,489
Here we go

1318
02:18:50,489 --> 02:18:52,489
Good, it works out pretty well

1319
02:19:00,399 --> 02:19:04,590
I love I love dots

1320
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:08,030
Damage over time. That's not a reference to any particular video game

1321
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:12,120
It's not a

1322
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:14,120
That's a dungeons and dragons reference

1323
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
All right, you're making me get hit stop

1324
02:19:26,809 --> 02:19:29,360
ooh

1325
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:32,479
Passive traps deal 500 damage

1326
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:38,860
That's ridiculous. I'll take the help

1327
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:45,069
All right aphrodite or the shop aphrodite

1328
02:19:54,350 --> 02:19:57,120
Watch out

1329
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:00,719
Take it slow. You don't have to go fast. What's the point of why do you have to go fast? You don't have to

1330
02:20:16,399 --> 02:20:18,280
nice

1331
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:20,280
Oh, it's aphrodite

1332
02:20:25,069 --> 02:20:29,309
Poison stacks, oh well way better now than I know that

1333
02:20:30,909 --> 02:20:32,909
You're the only exception

1334
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:40,799
Your cast is a wide short range blast and that's probably what i'm gonna take

1335
02:20:46,030 --> 02:20:47,850
ooh

1336
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:49,850
10 damage across the board reduced

1337
02:20:50,489 --> 02:20:56,969
Is that better than having a cast that does 100 damage? Hey, but if I hit them with the cast

1338
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:04,889
They do 30 less damage. Anyways, so this is 10 without doing anything. This is 30 and 100 damage

1339
02:21:07,239 --> 02:21:08,840
strength and beauty

1340
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:10,940
ooh

1341
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:12,700
Really short range

1342
02:21:12,700 --> 02:21:14,219
Yeah, it is isn't it?

1343
02:21:14,219 --> 02:21:16,299
It's okay

1344
02:21:16,299 --> 02:21:18,489
Look, here's what I can do. I can

1345
02:21:18,489 --> 02:21:22,649
I can go bang bang get in there blast get up and just watch the dots

1346
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:43,659
It stacks it stacks it stacks

1347
02:21:44,719 --> 02:21:45,840
Ooh

1348
02:21:45,840 --> 02:22:04,440
That hurt

1349
02:22:04,440 --> 02:22:05,639
Oh shit, they're getting okay

1350
02:22:05,639 --> 02:22:11,680
I gotta I gotta get I gotta I gotta get in there and get rid of these too many too many way too many over here

1351
02:22:12,319 --> 02:22:22,799
I'll get cocky

1352
02:22:22,799 --> 02:22:25,799
That's a lot of greed, but it's worth it

1353
02:22:25,799 --> 02:22:34,170
All right, we're fine. Zeus

1354
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:46,860
Lightning all right, and your attack emits chain lightning when you damage, right?

1355
02:22:47,629 --> 02:22:50,829
I really like that

1356
02:22:50,829 --> 02:23:10,219
But I feel like that's not as good when you don't have a bow still one. It's still better. It looks cool

1357
02:23:19,450 --> 02:23:22,010
Chain lightning is a is a shaman spell

1358
02:23:23,930 --> 02:23:25,209
Yes

1359
02:23:25,209 --> 02:23:27,290
Sure, but that's not I didn't reference that

1360
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:40,459
Holy shit. This is really good

1361
02:23:40,459 --> 02:24:09,040
Jesus there's so many of these. All right. Well, i'm taking too much damage here. These dicks are just everywhere. Don't get stabbed. All right

1362
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:14,329
We're gonna do nothing

1363
02:24:14,329 --> 02:24:15,530
dicks

1364
02:24:15,530 --> 02:24:18,090
Dicks every key run

1365
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:20,170
dicks everywhere

1366
02:24:20,959 --> 02:24:22,959
I meant like these guys are dicks

1367
02:24:23,440 --> 02:24:35,959
just spawn camp

1368
02:24:35,959 --> 02:24:45,120
Spawn camp don't let you all these guys are gonna blow up

1369
02:24:46,569 --> 02:24:47,610
Wow

1370
02:24:47,610 --> 02:25:00,680
Shit too far away. Just tick them down. Just tick them down

1371
02:25:09,149 --> 02:25:19,770
Tick them down

1372
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:24,809
You just got to get in there man. You just don't be so shy and just go don't be such a coward

1373
02:25:25,610 --> 02:25:41,520
You just got to get in just go just be good and just spawn camp right where they spawn just get in there

1374
02:25:42,319 --> 02:26:01,120
Stun them watch it. I want that

1375
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:04,479
You dead

1376
02:26:04,479 --> 02:26:06,879
One word take one word every minute

1377
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:11,760
I'll tell him capable of doing

1378
02:26:16,829 --> 02:26:18,829
Drop here. All right. What is this?

1379

29 health we got a new we got a new link

1380
02:26:23,930 --> 02:26:26,090
Are you gonna apologize for that? Ayaya thing?

1381
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:34,680

02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:36,360
I don't get this

1383
02:26:36,360 --> 02:26:50,879
But maybe some of you do I don't get it. I don't get it. Thanks though

1384
02:26:55,920 --> 02:27:03,209
Is this this is the one you wanted

1385
02:27:03,290 --> 02:27:04,639
Okay

1386
02:27:04,639 --> 02:27:14,750
also, no

1387
02:27:14,750 --> 02:27:16,750
What is is it this one?

1388
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,989
What's this? Okay

1389
02:27:26,989 --> 02:27:31,549
I'll expect one at four eleven two sixteen pounds. That's way smaller and way fatter than I am

1390
02:27:32,190 --> 02:27:35,309
Walled with a beard finished bug snacks on stream. I love that's a bullet point

1391
02:27:35,709 --> 02:27:40,139
We just want to make sure everyone knows he finished bug snacks on stream

1392
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:47,200
That's some major

1393
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:49,440
monumentally important piece of data

1394
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:56,319
nemesis crest

1395
02:27:56,319 --> 02:28:00,139
Oh, I want to I want to save it read the ticker

1396
02:28:02,059 --> 02:28:12,219
Trimmer germa 95 has accumulated 2.49 billion dollars plus right? All right, we can go key run

1397
02:28:20,110 --> 02:28:33,440
That armor what the hell are you hitting me with what? Oh, I was so clean, too

1398
02:28:36,430 --> 02:28:40,110
All right. I gotta move around too many. Oh my god. I'm getting destroyed in here

1399
02:28:44,989 --> 02:28:53,790
Holy shit. This room sucks. This room was horrible

1400
02:28:54,430 --> 02:28:57,389
There's traps everywhere and this projectiles in every corner

1401
02:28:58,350 --> 02:29:07,440
This can unlock shit, that's too much damage. All right, not gonna get hit for a while

1402
02:29:15,239 --> 02:29:24,649
uh shop

1403
02:29:24,969 --> 02:29:26,969
Four keys and

1404
02:29:26,969 --> 02:29:29,020
extra super health

1405
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:31,739
Strength of the centaurs. What do you want? Hey carol

1406
02:29:32,139 --> 02:29:35,420
If there happens to be something really horrible awaiting me beyond that door, then

1407
02:29:35,979 --> 02:29:38,860
Give me a sign. Won't you please stop hitting me over the head with a broom?

1408
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:48,600
Oh wait, oh this boss time

1409
02:29:51,159 --> 02:29:54,600
I gotta get this ready. This is this guy this first boss. It's not a problem. Let's go

1410
02:29:56,440 --> 02:30:05,639
Cyberpunk is out. I didn't even know it came out again. Is it out? Oh my god

1411
02:30:07,159 --> 02:30:20,299
No, 3080 no ps5. No cyberpunk. I'm sure he'd welcome all this feedback. Let's let's kick this lady's ass

1412
02:30:24,459 --> 02:30:33,520
Holy shit, I just ate that

1413
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:35,600
I haven't played with a sword the whole time

1414
02:30:43,930 --> 02:30:45,930
Been a while since I played with anything besides the sword

1415
02:31:01,209 --> 02:31:02,090
Die

1416
02:31:02,090 --> 02:31:05,370
All right, here we go. This is the weird part

1417
02:31:05,370 --> 02:31:22,409
All right, get her get her get her get her

1418
02:31:22,409 --> 02:31:24,170
Oh shit, what am I doing?

1419
02:31:24,170 --> 02:32:00,190
I'm not a sword user. It's very evident. Okay. Fuck you. You just spawned on me

1420
02:32:06,889 --> 02:32:10,329
Oh my god, i'm i'm not a sword user. I'm not a sword user. That's very clear

1421
02:32:11,049 --> 02:32:12,729
I'm terrible with melee

1422
02:32:12,729 --> 02:32:57,739
This lady was a was a cakewalk with the bow. I'll still do it. But holy shit. That was painful. Remember just do coke

1423
02:32:59,819 --> 02:33:04,360
Oh, uh, no

1424
02:33:11,870 --> 02:33:25,229
Oh you don't

1425
02:33:25,229 --> 02:33:46,059
Okay, that's that was way harder with melee. I'm a bow guy

1426
02:33:46,620 --> 02:33:56,809
Got you told some sort of power but for what I always use the bows in games

1427
02:34:00,909 --> 02:34:05,680
Melee is for suckers. Imagine be able to hurt things from 500 feet away

1428
02:34:06,170 --> 02:34:11,559
Other than walk one feet away and try to hurt somebody. I mean, come on. How would you know?

1429
02:34:11,559 --> 02:34:23,280
Why would you ever use anything else of honor?

1430
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,040
You know, what's really really honorable?

1431
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:31,520
And really hard to do is to shoot somebody with a bow from a half mile away

1432
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:41,000
That's not honorable at all. That's is it what is honor keepsake collection just with the house contractor

1433
02:34:41,079 --> 02:34:43,079
That's incredibly dishonorable

1434
02:34:46,479 --> 02:34:49,920
Shooting somebody from a half a mile away versus facing them one on one

1435
02:34:50,479 --> 02:34:52,559
I think that's the definition of dishonor

1436
02:34:53,200 --> 02:35:12,479
Can I read this thing? I don't need these they dishonored on stream

1437
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
No, I already did

1438
02:35:16,239 --> 02:35:20,319
Didn't I play dishonored either in a youtube video or already did it?

1439
02:35:23,659 --> 02:35:32,319
Even as its dangers lie in wait by the shield. Yeah, this is a key run. I want to unlock the other weapons

1440
02:35:35,639 --> 02:35:39,799
Wait, hold on. Somebody has something important jerma, please read you chose dog shit boons

1441
02:35:40,280 --> 02:35:42,600
Zeus boons are great for synergies with cast and dash

1442
02:35:43,139 --> 02:35:46,780
Aphrodite and aries are great attack boons and dianesis

1443
02:35:47,319 --> 02:35:53,799
Has an insane cast boon you'll learn more synergies, but please stop talking taking shit boons dash modifiers are actually really good

1444
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:59,549
Especially zeus. I've been playing the game for like an hour like two hours. I don't even know who aries is

1445
02:36:01,149 --> 02:36:03,149
I don't have 4 000 hours in the game yet

1446
02:36:03,629 --> 02:36:08,170
I haven't even unlocked all the gods yet

1447
02:36:08,409 --> 02:36:14,200
Closer to the surface

1448
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:26,270
I didn't even know aries was in this game until you just told me the asphodel meadows

1449
02:36:27,239 --> 02:36:33,239
Within the suffocating heat of asphodel reside the vast majority. It's literally greek myth on the earth and died

1450
02:36:33,559 --> 02:36:40,520
I know there they persist until the end nobody's gonna get banned for trying to give me advice. Okay, please relax

1451
02:36:41,709 --> 02:36:45,309
Or I will strike you down chat. I will do sub only

1452
02:36:45,790 --> 02:36:48,280
20 minute time to talk

1453
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:51,959
Crush the bones to dust

1454
02:36:55,819 --> 02:36:58,440
All right, I want maybe no

1455
02:36:58,440 --> 02:37:13,469
You're a key here. See you later alligator skull cry. All right, I gotta play

1456
02:37:17,399 --> 02:37:18,670
land

1457
02:37:18,670 --> 02:37:20,030
land

1458
02:37:20,030 --> 02:37:30,170
That was pretty good chain

1459
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:50,729
That was pretty good chain. I'll go in the lava and chase them. What are you doing?

1460
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:56,459
This game is outdated play something dude. Did this come out like four months ago?

1461
02:37:57,100 --> 02:37:59,600
It came out this year

1462
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:06,500
Saints row two waiting room. It's outdated

1463
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:15,680
uh

1464
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:25,229
Popping granite play something fun for once this game is fun

1465
02:38:29,709 --> 02:38:49,950
Some of you guys mad that's got nominated for game of the year or something. I can't reach

1466
02:38:50,510 --> 02:38:53,709
Come over. I don't want to go in the lava to fight you

1467
02:38:59,389 --> 02:39:01,229
Wow, they have explosives

1468
02:39:01,229 --> 02:39:11,319
Did I get hurt that hurt me?

1469
02:39:11,719 --> 02:39:13,719
Oh, no, I got art. I got art

1470
02:39:26,889 --> 02:39:30,010
No, not I didn't say anything after hurt

1471
02:39:34,590 --> 02:39:37,309
You want me to say a particular rock after that, don't you?

1472
02:39:37,950 --> 02:39:44,920
That's heat. Okay

1473

Each character gives you a trinket on their first gift. So give a gift to everybody. I will definitely what the fuck Jesus

1482
02:41:41,899 --> 02:41:49,290

This is new that's Artemis and wait, is that a new god?

We're should do the quest you should go to fart of us singing I agree what?

1487
02:42:40,860 --> 02:42:42,860
Uh, oh, it's a new god

1488
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:54,620
Okay, the god of chefs could dash clear through that wall. I think

Is that cassadelicum with jalapenos?

1503
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,360
All right. Let's see

1504
02:44:07,360 --> 02:44:11,559
Up to two random boons of yours are upgraded to the next rarity. That's pretty awesome

1505
02:44:13,290 --> 02:44:17,530
Or random boons of your of yours gain level one plus one level

1506
02:44:18,250 --> 02:44:29,000
Isn't the part which is better?

1507

Like can I give a gift?

1510
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:50,729
This is not like, uh, some of those games

1511
02:44:51,870 --> 02:44:58,829
Where you can some of those games that exist where there's fighting of non-playable characters

1512
02:44:59,950 --> 02:45:06,760
and

1513
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:08,760
Didn't say it. I didn't say it

1516
02:45:35,180 --> 02:46:13,610
Stack the fuck out of this. What am I doing? Oh wait, you could hit that you can hurt yourself that for real

1520
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:08,780
Your dash causes a hangover several times near where you started

1521
02:47:17,899 --> 02:47:19,899
That's that third one's not very good

1522

22 slower move speed. That's really good. But this is good, too

The only place for anyone to have a little fun around here and you seal it shut

1616
02:58:59,049 --> 02:59:08,430
Oh, I had little choice about that boy. You see after you fled the first time Cerberus

1617
02:59:08,430 --> 02:59:13,069
Well, I have a bunch of keys very much upset utterly tore the place to shreds

1618
02:59:13,629 --> 02:59:16,879
It's now under repair all thanks to you

1619
02:59:17,440 --> 02:59:24,379
I think I can get all the weapons me for not minding the dog while I was out and while you all were here

1620
02:59:26,860 --> 02:59:33,579
I laid the blame entirely upon you. Yes, who else it's fortunate that Cerberus has calmed himself since then

1621
02:59:34,379 --> 02:59:36,379
Come to his senses. I should say

1622
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:38,940
May you yet come to yours?

1623
02:59:39,819 --> 02:59:41,819
What's all the paperwork he's doing?

1624
02:59:43,610 --> 02:59:45,610
Did they tell us about that yet?

1625
02:59:45,850 --> 02:59:49,040
If I don't patch your other heads don't bite my arm off deal

Cool, let's go get the other weapons or are not we each have our commitments to this house megara

03:00:04,909 --> 03:00:06,909
There is no shame in yours

1628
03:00:06,909 --> 03:00:11,319
And whilst your sisters are away you bear their burden of responsibility as well

1629
03:00:11,879 --> 03:00:15,600
So that like whoa

1630
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:25,879
Get loud thing did my limiter come in and just try to kill that did it even help? No

1631
03:00:31,180 --> 03:00:36,379
It didn't help I have a limiter on it should have uh, it should have at least squelched a little bit of that

1632
03:00:40,700 --> 03:00:42,299
I understand

1633
03:00:42,299 --> 03:00:46,059
It's just am I supposed to keep pretending nothing's changed

1634
03:00:46,780 --> 03:00:52,299
This house is cracking at the seams and no one's going to admit it. It's too late. We heard everything

1635
03:00:53,020 --> 03:00:56,350
House shall stand eternally

1636
03:00:56,750 --> 03:01:03,069
Although in what condition it is ours to decide our obligation is to keep the house in order

1637
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:06,840
All right. I'm gonna go check on the uh

1638
03:01:06,840 --> 03:01:10,520
You're right. Of course. You're right. This game's really good. I'll do my best. I'm having a lot of fun

1639
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
I'll do my best for both our sakes next

1640
03:01:13,799 --> 03:01:18,120
What was that about? I don't know. You're the nosy one

1641
03:01:18,840 --> 03:01:26,270
Let me take a look at my quests. Something's added to the fated list

1642
03:01:28,569 --> 03:01:30,840
Okay

1643
03:01:30,840 --> 03:01:41,850
Freddy dredge just gave 50 bucks. What's up, freddy can't sleep. Thanks for the 5 000 bits freddy already says I freaking love this game

1644
03:01:42,889 --> 03:01:55,260
It's very good. Well, oh, hold on. Okay. Wait, should I use the keys on the mirror or

1645
03:01:55,819 --> 03:02:04,440
Use the keys on the let's up. Let's get the weapons first, right? Give me the weapons, but thanks freddy

1646
03:02:04,440 --> 03:02:07,319
Thanks for the huge insane amount of money. Thanks for the 50 bucks

1647
03:02:11,450 --> 03:02:15,370
Yeah, let me i'm gonna lock the weapons and then we'll go from there and i'm gonna see which one I actually like the most

1648
03:02:18,940 --> 03:02:20,940
They'll get the coward's shield

1649
03:02:22,139 --> 03:02:25,659
I'll try it. Oh, i'm paid to take it not to dish it out now. Give it to me

1650
03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:30,569
Okay, so uh, I can't get both

1651
03:02:31,450 --> 03:02:33,450
I can get shield or I can get spear

1652
03:02:41,500 --> 03:02:45,319
See what this is shield of chaos the shield

1653
03:02:46,280 --> 03:02:48,280
Okay, x is bash

1654
03:02:49,950 --> 03:02:51,950
There's no combo. It's just one

1655
03:02:52,489 --> 03:02:54,170
old to defend

1656
03:02:54,170 --> 03:02:57,639
Okay, and when you release you dash forward

1657
03:03:03,069 --> 03:03:06,399
That's a huge dash

1658
03:03:06,479 --> 03:03:08,639
Throw oh you throw the shield. Okay

1659
03:03:15,260 --> 03:03:16,780
and then this is

1660
03:03:16,780 --> 03:03:18,780
You can do this while dashing

1661
03:03:20,250 --> 03:03:26,030
Cool you hold it. It blocks all damage

1662
03:03:26,590 --> 03:03:27,469
Really?

1663
03:03:27,469 --> 03:03:31,450
Okay, i'll try it

1664
03:03:32,409 --> 03:03:36,569
I'll give it a try

1665
03:03:36,569 --> 03:03:39,610
So it's a block all damage that's inside of those lines

1666
03:03:40,170 --> 03:03:42,409
Or is it like 180 degrees in front of the character?

1667
03:03:50,680 --> 03:03:52,680
Just that front just those lines. Okay

1668
03:03:53,239 --> 03:04:00,319
Oh, what's this new thing? I got that one do the next boon you find will be from zeus

1669
03:04:00,879 --> 03:04:15,340
His blessings have plus 10 chance to be rare. I think this one's just better for me. Anyways

1670
03:04:15,899 --> 03:04:19,120
I get to come back to life twice. I feel like it's necessary

1671
03:04:21,159 --> 03:04:24,840
All right, let's go. Wait, there is a combo is there that was weird. How come I just went?

1672
03:04:25,799 --> 03:04:33,690
Oh, I guess you can do a little combo if you do the dash too

1673
03:04:37,120 --> 03:04:39,709
Yeah, you can do a combo if you do the dash

1674
03:04:42,969 --> 03:04:45,530
Achilles achilles achilles achilles achilles achilles achilles achilles

1675
03:04:47,079 --> 03:05:09,450
Where is he? Is he here? There's no teacher like the real thing have something for you

1676
03:05:10,010 --> 03:05:14,569
Gift you're giving me your codex. I can't accept codex

1677
03:05:18,799 --> 03:05:20,729
Please I insist

1678
03:05:20,729 --> 03:05:24,090
I want your love of history to grow not just your love of warfare

1679
03:05:24,809 --> 03:05:29,930
Besides maybe you can finish out the rest of it. I have a question for all of you guys that have played all of the

1680
03:05:30,569 --> 03:05:32,780
super

1681
03:05:32,780 --> 03:05:37,770
Massive giant games. Uh, I really like this

1682
03:05:38,670 --> 03:05:49,420
Almost everything about it. I passed on transistor and I passed on

1683
03:05:50,040 --> 03:06:13,739
Bastion should I play them bastion is like this bastion, especially okay higher. Wait, is bastion by the same company?

1684
03:06:14,299 --> 03:06:24,010
Yeah, it is very okay

1685
03:06:24,010 --> 03:06:25,370
Denied what?

1686
03:06:25,450 --> 03:06:38,750
All right, so this is just lore codex undiscovered. Okay, cool. Got my lore codex. Thanks guys

1687
03:06:42,670 --> 03:06:44,270
Yeah, because I don't know

1688
03:06:44,270 --> 03:06:49,229
Transistor and pyre they didn't I they didn't do it for me. I wasn't into them. I was like, uh

1689
03:06:51,180 --> 03:07:17,159
Are they like this? I feel like this is different. All right, let's just try it higher is the most different

1690
03:07:17,159 --> 03:07:21,870
Okay, how many times have I referenced one of the four games so far? I believe twice

1691
03:07:23,049 --> 03:07:24,729
once accidentally

1692
03:07:24,729 --> 03:07:26,829
So, I don't know if it counts

1693
03:07:26,829 --> 03:07:28,989
One absolutely absolutely at least once

1694
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:36,700
This one was bound to show up I guess in the name of hades olympus. I accept this message finally aries, right?

1695
03:07:38,139 --> 03:07:41,719
Has to be the fighting spirit in you there. I have to say

1696
03:07:42,600 --> 03:07:46,680
Most intriguing and yet no surprise for someone born in hell itself

1697
03:07:47,559 --> 03:07:49,799
You come on out of there and tell me all about it

1698
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:52,600
I'm a fellow student of death you see

1699
03:07:55,879 --> 03:08:00,909
Okay doom you and your attacks inflict doom

1700
03:08:02,680 --> 03:08:05,319
After a brief moment the victim takes a burst of damage

1701
03:08:06,909 --> 03:08:08,670
Okay, does it happen?

1702
03:08:08,670 --> 03:08:12,780
after every swing

1703
03:08:12,780 --> 03:08:15,579
Your special inflicts doom. I feel like that's better because it's ranged

1704
03:08:17,760 --> 03:08:19,760
Dash creates a blade riff where you started

1705
03:08:20,239 --> 03:08:25,159
It does doom does not stack. Yeah, this one's probably way better because it's ranged

1706
03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:29,440
Yeah, I mean I can that's an extra 60 damage on range

1707
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:33,920
Holy shit. Yeah, that's amazing. That's incredible

1708
03:08:37,340 --> 03:08:38,860
It doesn't stack

1709
03:08:38,860 --> 03:08:40,540
Yeah, but still I mean I can do

1710
03:08:40,540 --> 03:08:45,719
This is a coward run prince delves back into the underworld

1711
03:08:45,799 --> 03:08:54,360
It's ever shifting chambers realign to frustrate his attempts to perhaps map it out built to ensure no one gets out

1712
03:08:54,840 --> 03:08:56,360
We'll see about that

1713
03:08:56,360 --> 03:08:58,360
Wait, I should be looking for chests shouldn't I?

1714
03:08:58,600 --> 03:09:03,840
Didn't I unlock that?

1715
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:05,600
This bounces too

1716
03:09:05,600 --> 03:09:09,260
I want to test the damage reduction. What can I do that to?

1717
03:09:09,979 --> 03:09:16,620
Holy shit, that's awesome

1718
03:09:16,620 --> 03:09:19,180
Are there any is there any caveats at all with that?

1719
03:09:19,739 --> 03:09:23,100
Or is it truly just you can just eat damage forever

1720
03:09:24,110 --> 03:09:28,030
If I just sit like this I can absorb a hundred every second all damage. No matter what

1721
03:09:29,420 --> 03:09:32,569
forever

1722
03:09:32,569 --> 03:09:34,729
That's very useful. Can I cancel it?

1723
03:09:35,530 --> 03:09:38,010
Can I can I can I cancel it? But do I have to dash?

1724
03:09:41,440 --> 03:09:46,360
Okay. Well, here's something I will say

1725
03:09:47,610 --> 03:09:54,430
All the weapons so far have been very very interesting and very different. Do I want money or do I what's this one?

1726
03:09:55,579 --> 03:10:00,319
Is this a god right? Yeah, that's a god

1727
03:10:12,860 --> 03:10:17,629
Very good. That doom is so good on the shield. It's so good

1728
03:10:18,190 --> 03:10:32,680
You just have to touch him too. It just bounces around all over the place. I don't have any gifts, right?

1729
03:10:33,159 --> 03:10:43,520
Harry's reached you didn't always found his conduct. That's a bandwagon opinion. Whatever. It seems he's helping you for now

1730
03:10:47,399 --> 03:10:50,520
Okay, your attack is stronger and can deflect

1731
03:10:51,790 --> 03:10:54,750
well, uh

1732
03:10:54,750 --> 03:11:00,510
that seems to be very very good because now I can block all damage and just

1733
03:11:01,229 --> 03:11:09,000
Hit back all projectiles does the block count as an attack?

1734
03:11:09,559 --> 03:11:14,409
Because if it is I can launch I can just sit there right it does

1735
03:11:17,020 --> 03:11:21,020
No, i'm seeing this is no it doesn't it does it does not know. Oh

1736
03:11:23,370 --> 03:11:42,159
I don't want this one. I mean you it's gonna be this one your wisdom guide me first is better. Yeah, so what can I

1737
03:11:42,879 --> 03:11:46,159
Wow, even not even projectiles. It's everything

1738
03:11:48,940 --> 03:11:50,540
This is incredible

1739
03:11:50,540 --> 03:11:54,969
Oh my god, it's so good. It's so good

1740
03:12:00,459 --> 03:12:02,459
And with the doom on it, too

1741
03:12:02,459 --> 03:12:17,530
It's so good. It's so good

1742
03:12:22,280 --> 03:12:24,760
That's broken

1743
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:27,239
Well, I mean not maybe a little

1744
03:12:27,959 --> 03:12:48,170
It's not broken at all

1745
03:12:48,170 --> 03:12:50,170
I mean, I don't I don't think it is

1746
03:12:50,889 --> 03:12:55,850
You have to look you have to really really stand still and things can just spawn behind you in this game. That's not good

1747
03:13:03,579 --> 03:13:05,739
But it is very very good though. Like very good

1748
03:13:06,379 --> 03:13:08,459
This is the kind of play style. I like safe

1749
03:13:09,260 --> 03:13:16,700
It hits everything in a line too. All right, that's a little broken

1750
03:13:17,340 --> 03:13:20,860
That's a little overpowered that I can hit everything in this line, not just the first enemy

1751
03:13:21,819 --> 03:13:34,479
We got to build on this though

1752
03:13:34,479 --> 03:13:35,760
Oh

1753
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:38,809
I don't know

1754
03:13:38,809 --> 03:13:42,809
More damage with the attack but more doom damage

1755
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:45,600
Yeah, of course. Absolutely

1756
03:13:45,600 --> 03:14:02,239
Do I do more keys or should I go for upgrade run? Hey, this is a boss

1757
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:10,000
Yeah, where is it? Oh shit. You're so there's blocks. That's right

1758
03:14:10,799 --> 03:14:24,639
All right. Where are you? Where are you? Oh, how are you an elite?

1759
03:14:26,559 --> 03:14:27,840
That's an elite

1760
03:14:27,840 --> 03:14:35,760
I guess you're doing a shitload of bombs

1761
03:14:35,840 --> 03:14:37,840
Oh my god, it is a lot

1762
03:14:42,780 --> 03:14:45,659
Oh my god, all right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait kill this guy

1763
03:14:46,459 --> 03:14:58,940
Oh, this is the real coward. This is the real coward move

1764
03:14:59,579 --> 03:15:06,200
Give me that key

1765
03:15:06,200 --> 03:15:10,040
This is total cheese

1766
03:15:11,639 --> 03:15:13,950
That's another aries door

1767
03:15:13,950 --> 03:15:16,270
Yeah, that's another i'm gonna be able to upgrade doom again

1768
03:15:26,639 --> 03:15:28,639
All right, let's do this. Just wait

1769
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:33,040
Don't be an idiot here. Hold on just because you can block everything doesn't mean you need to block everything

1770
03:15:33,760 --> 03:15:48,319
This is doom run. Yeah, it's just doom doom doom doom doom doom. Don't don't don't don't don't

1771
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:51,629
All right. Don't freak out. Just dodge

1772
03:15:51,790 --> 03:15:57,239
Just bounce it around

1773
03:15:57,239 --> 03:16:17,450
I swear

1774
03:16:17,450 --> 03:16:20,649
Lucky tooth rank up

1775
03:16:20,649 --> 03:16:22,969
What happened? I ranked up lucky tooth

1776
03:16:31,760 --> 03:16:33,760
I gotta give this guy a gift. Seriously

1777
03:16:36,459 --> 03:16:41,420
Except you see dear cousin that some members of our family are predisposed toward the unspeakable

1778
03:16:41,979 --> 03:16:44,219
I caution you around my half brother is all

1779
03:16:44,780 --> 03:16:46,940
Now keep sakes level up the more that you use them. Oh, okay

1780
03:16:48,860 --> 03:16:51,180
Oh, that's right. It was like 25 000 points or something

1781
03:16:53,149 --> 03:16:59,709
You only do as you see fit lord aries mind that you continue pulling in the same direction as us all

1782
03:17:03,469 --> 03:17:04,590
Yes

1783
03:17:04,590 --> 03:17:08,159
What's this?

1784
03:17:08,159 --> 03:17:10,959
What hold on? Wait a minute. I need to look at this

1785
03:17:12,159 --> 03:17:14,319
Your dash creates a blade rift who cares

1786
03:17:14,799 --> 03:17:18,000
Your doom effects deal more damage when applied multiple times

1787
03:17:19,840 --> 03:17:22,219
but duo

1788
03:17:22,219 --> 03:17:25,819
Your abilities that can deflect immediately activate doom

1789
03:17:27,450 --> 03:17:30,350
So I put the doom effect

1790
03:17:30,989 --> 03:17:41,500
And then I just hit x and it'll detonate really so I can go just

1791
03:17:42,920 --> 03:17:50,780
Throw shield x throw shield x throw shield x throw shield and it'll just be 100 100 100 with extra combo damage

1792
03:17:51,180 --> 03:18:04,090
Oh shit, all right. Don't i'm not gonna get complacent here because this feels like this could be really good

1793
03:18:09,129 --> 03:18:12,010
I gotta watch my health. Take care. Be easy

1794
03:18:13,069 --> 03:18:15,229
As I will blow this i'll ruin this whole thing

1795
03:18:22,239 --> 03:18:24,700
Oh shit

1796
03:18:24,700 --> 03:18:25,979
Oh nice

1797
03:18:25,979 --> 03:18:37,479
So I just got a free fountain. I don't have enough money. What is that?

1798
03:18:41,020 --> 03:18:53,659
Is that two gods in one perhaps unimaginable occasionally is to be for not a moment. That's a duo in there. Oh shit. Let's do it

1799
03:18:55,309 --> 03:18:57,149
All right, i'm gonna play good

1800
03:18:57,149 --> 03:19:01,850
This is an elite room. Let's see how this works

1801
03:19:04,159 --> 03:19:11,100
Wait, what whichever god I don't pleased whichever god I don't pick will be very mad at me

1802
03:19:11,899 --> 03:19:13,870
So who do I pick?

1803
03:19:13,870 --> 03:19:15,870
Ares again and just go full doom

1804
03:19:26,940 --> 03:19:29,420
Okay

1805
03:19:29,420 --> 03:19:33,100
Rift cast your cast sends a blade rift hurling ahead. I don't care

1806
03:19:35,260 --> 03:19:38,219
After you take damage and flick doom on foes around you

1807
03:19:39,659 --> 03:19:43,819
After using death defines deal more damage that encounter. That's okay

1808
03:19:46,639 --> 03:19:54,040
I mean, this is the one that's a synergy here. I mean if I take damage I can it'll just doom

1809
03:20:00,409 --> 03:20:06,270
They all kind of suck. Actually, i'm gonna stick with this

1810
03:20:06,909 --> 03:20:14,430
Just doom build now. She's mad punishable choice. But if you wish to face the consequences

1811
03:20:15,129 --> 03:20:20,409
So be it

1812
03:20:20,409 --> 03:20:22,409
You angered the gods

1813
03:20:22,409 --> 03:20:46,250
I hate to do this athena. Hey, hey, hey, why are you? It's so good

1814
03:20:46,969 --> 03:20:52,170
What are you linked to?

1815
03:20:52,170 --> 03:21:15,610
I took too much damage here. Oh now athena gives me some cool shit incident and keep our focus on the task

1816
03:21:18,319 --> 03:21:20,319
Half-life two crowbar

1817
03:21:26,719 --> 03:21:28,719
Uh, I don't have a cast

1818
03:21:28,719 --> 03:21:30,879
But this is just

1819
03:21:30,879 --> 03:21:34,350
Your abilities that can deflect also make foes exposed

1820
03:21:35,069 --> 03:21:37,069
I need a cast though, don't I?

1821
03:21:40,200 --> 03:21:53,399
This is really good. It's just straight up five percent damage. Five percent's not that much though

1822
03:21:56,799 --> 03:22:10,479
Yeah, just take the bonus damage. It's just bonus damage. Just take it. All right keys or gems. Uh,

1823
03:22:11,440 --> 03:22:13,440
Let's get keys so I can get the spear

1824
03:22:14,159 --> 03:22:26,239
Easy

1825
03:22:26,239 --> 03:22:31,129
Oh my god. Okay. I'm fine

1826
03:22:31,129 --> 03:22:34,569
Just throw the shield. I don't have to do anything just throw throw the shield and block attacks. I'm good

1827
03:22:35,209 --> 03:22:56,079
Who's next? Whoa, what happened? He exploded

1828
03:22:56,719 --> 03:23:17,040
Key to a weapon. I'm sorry. I'm loud. I know i'm sorry i'm gonna i'm gonna go away from the mic

1829
03:23:22,729 --> 03:23:36,620
Locked bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce. Oh my god. I'm getting overwhelmed

1830
03:23:37,340 --> 03:23:51,879
Stay in the corner for a second

1831
03:23:51,879 --> 03:23:59,180
Bounce it bounce it bounce it bounce it

1832
03:23:59,180 --> 03:24:08,329
Wowee

1833
03:24:08,969 --> 03:24:14,360
What the fuck is happening damnable fools finally

1834
03:24:17,870 --> 03:24:19,870
Taking too much damage from these rums

1835
03:24:20,620 --> 03:24:30,430
Throwing no i'm not throwing good. I'm gonna get i'm gonna get my ass kicked by that fucking goddamn snake boss again

1836
03:24:32,440 --> 03:24:45,840
Have to take damage your phone. I kind of don't want any of these but here's a cast

1837
03:24:49,840 --> 03:24:50,879
Mmm

1838
03:24:50,879 --> 03:24:58,090
This is good, too, though

1839
03:24:58,090 --> 03:24:59,690
Yeah, i'll take three

1840
03:25:01,739 --> 03:25:04,860
Is my hair sticking up

1841
03:25:04,860 --> 03:25:06,510
Let's see

1842
03:25:06,510 --> 03:25:10,670
12 health for 23. What a terrible terrible waste of money, but I need it

1843
03:25:12,700 --> 03:25:17,959
Ain't a random item

1844
03:25:17,959 --> 03:25:20,430
Do I get this?

1845
03:25:20,430 --> 03:25:23,950
Ain't a random item offered from the well of sharon. Maybe I maybe

1846
03:25:25,149 --> 03:25:27,239
random item

1847
03:25:27,239 --> 03:25:33,770
Should be handy. What is it in 20 movement speed?

1848
03:25:36,510 --> 03:25:39,879
Kind of sucks. Oh, all right. I need the I want the health

1849
03:25:40,760 --> 03:25:45,559
This is probably just I know but like the hammer is good, but like I well I only have 50 hp

1850
03:25:46,600 --> 03:25:52,680
Always hammer. No, I need the health so bad. I'm gonna die. It's the snake skeleton thing

1851
03:25:53,479 --> 03:26:25,399
Who's next? Okay. We're good

1852
03:26:25,559 --> 03:26:27,930
hammer

1853
03:26:27,930 --> 03:26:31,049
Your dash strike deals 50 damage in a larger area

1854
03:26:31,530 --> 03:26:42,170
Your special can strike up to four additional foes before returning your ball rush charges faster. That's really good. That's very good

1855
03:26:43,129 --> 03:26:46,319
I can hit four people

1856
03:26:46,319 --> 03:27:01,520
Okay now i'm getting the health. Thank you

1857
03:27:02,649 --> 03:27:07,690
75 and here's the boss. All right, let me pee first for this fight. This fight's a piss fight. I gotta pee

1858
03:27:08,329 --> 03:27:14,079
I'll be right. This is the stupid bone animal in a minute

1859
03:29:25,790 --> 03:29:31,100
Okay, I am ready to tackle this. The best part about this is I can just hold x

1860
03:29:31,819 --> 03:29:43,760
And block the machine gun. So I just have to get through the insane five person snake encounter and i'll be good

1861
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:46,540
theoretically, right

1862
03:29:46,540 --> 03:29:50,000
I'm gonna sit here and go like this and block the whole thing and then go bang bang bang bang bang run away

1863
03:29:54,760 --> 03:30:13,739
Oh, it's meg, right? Oh, well fine. Whatever. What are you doing zagreus? What the hell is this weapon?

1864
03:30:14,540 --> 03:30:17,879
It's just a ribbon

1865
03:30:17,879 --> 03:30:22,430
It's like, oh, that's a prank lightsaber

1866
03:30:22,430 --> 03:30:30,969
This can't stay sealed shut forever make might get some practice in you know

1867
03:30:31,209 --> 03:30:38,750
Well, you're the first boss of like eight rooms floors or whatever you are

1868
03:30:46,840 --> 03:30:49,159
Wow, that hurt a lot. What the fuck was I doing?

1869
03:30:49,799 --> 03:31:02,600
Just don't be an idiot. I'm good

1870
03:31:02,600 --> 03:31:05,360
I think I peed out all my gamer sense. I really think I did

1871
03:31:11,040 --> 03:31:12,799
Can you do that? Is that possible?

1872
03:31:12,799 --> 03:31:16,510
I think I like pissed out all my vitamins

1873
03:31:24,000 --> 03:31:26,239
Fucking trap. I swear to god it hit me again

1874
03:31:26,879 --> 03:31:38,280
It's the second time I got hit by the dumb trap

1875
03:31:41,049 --> 03:31:44,090
Oh my god, I I pissed out all my gamer sense. I really think I did

1876
03:31:44,729 --> 03:31:48,590
I I feel visibly slower right now

1877
03:32:27,739 --> 03:32:28,780
Okay

1878
03:32:28,780 --> 03:32:36,909
I like peed out all my skill when I was peeing. I felt it too. It was like yeah, i'm ready to do this boss

1879
03:32:38,590 --> 03:32:40,590
I'm slowing down

1880
03:32:42,010 --> 03:33:01,950
I'm like slower and relaxed. What am I doing playing a game right now? I'm okay though. Enjoy the searing heat of asphodel

1881
03:33:03,840 --> 03:33:05,840

Hmm. Probably this one. Let's do one. Hope you like it.

1922
03:37:49,940 --> 03:38:03,059
First of Vengeance and Blinding Flash got upgraded. Oh, that was bad. Oh, that was

1924
03:38:11,030 --> 03:38:29,329
Really? Two out of eight? Well, whatever. Sucks. Somebody said chat actually sucks at

1925
03:38:29,329 --> 03:38:52,000
this game. Well, do they? I don't know. I mean, let him attack. Just kill him. Wow! He

1927
03:39:09,530 --> 03:39:18,180
like X, Y, X, Y, X, Y, X, Y. It just does 140 damage. You've been choosing good stuff

1928
03:39:18,180 --> 03:39:27,620
on accident and chat has been suggesting terrible stuff on purpose. Prove? Trial? Earned up

1929
03:39:27,620 --> 03:39:55,139
to $100. The challenge. Okay. All right. That's a... What? Yeah, I thought... For a second

1930
03:39:55,139 --> 03:40:19,950
I thought he said I didn't get it. I was gonna say that's bullshit. Oh, this is a new god.

1931
03:40:19,950 --> 03:40:37,159
Shouldn't this get out? Come on, dude. Really? Oh, fuck me. Hermes, you better be worth

1932
03:40:37,159 --> 03:40:51,459
it. Did I miss that? All right, Hermes, you better have something cool. Restore all health

1933
03:40:51,459 --> 03:41:16,069
every second. Mercury! Each time you enter a chamber, a game

1934
03:41:16,069 --> 03:41:23,110
a bit of wealth. So I get 10 gold every time I go into a new spot. Old castifier in rapid

1935
03:41:23,110 --> 03:41:28,780
succession. Dash? You can dash more times in a row. Wait, that's three dashes in a row.

1936
03:41:28,780 --> 03:41:36,520
Appreciate the lift, Lord Hermes, sir. Now let's go. This is such a good build. Please

1937
03:41:36,520 --> 03:41:42,620
don't waste it on me being terrible at everything. Restore 10% of your health when you go in a

1938
03:41:42,620 --> 03:41:58,700
new chamber. Yeah. That's three chambers. 10% of 75 is 7.5. Gain this instantly. Payment

1940
03:42:18,930 --> 03:42:27,979

1942
03:43:27,420 --> 03:43:52,270
dodge and the glom? All right, I'm good. Ooh. Ooh. Wait, how many? Your dash deals damage

1943
03:43:52,270 --> 03:44:01,889
and can deflect. What? Oh. What is this? I get extra health points. This triggers doom.

1944
03:44:01,889 --> 03:44:32,739
Deflecting does doom. Look at this. Look at this crazy build I've got going. Shit, this

1945
03:44:32,739 --> 03:44:56,399
is pretty... Okay, pay attention. You're gonna die, cloud. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1946
03:44:56,399 --> 03:45:21,700
yeah, yeah. 128 for doom. Definitely one. That's a 30% increase in damage. Where should I go?

1947
03:45:22,420 --> 03:45:34,799
Okay, max health, the shop, or Hermes again. Oh, this is tricky. I don't know. Max health,

1948
03:45:34,799 --> 03:45:48,459
or the shop. I don't know. Oh, this is so hard. They're all good. I have like 300 plus dollars.

1949
03:45:48,459 --> 03:45:58,370
I gotta spend it. Yes. What a good choice that was.

1950
03:45:58,370 --> 03:46:17,569
Let's do this first. Bye. We do.

1951
03:46:23,809 --> 03:46:40,030
Your attack, special, and cast deal more damage. That's just more damage. Yeah. 13% more damage.

1952
03:46:40,030 --> 03:46:47,280
All right, now let's buy the pomegranate. Your dash deals damage and can deflect.

1953
03:46:47,920 --> 03:46:53,860
After you take damage, your foe is struck by lightning or backstab bonus. Probably this one.

1954
03:46:54,579 --> 03:47:00,819
Probably not going to happen that often. I don't care about damage on this one because

1955
03:47:00,819 --> 03:47:14,180
it's doing boon already. I don't get extra like boon damage, right? Oh, yeah, this one.

1956
03:47:14,899 --> 03:47:24,379
And then I'll take the meal. I'm ready. I'm ready for the boss. This is it. I have to beat this guy.

1957
03:47:28,930 --> 03:47:33,309
Okay. All right. I'm going to be quiet and I'm going to do this right and I'm going to try

1958
03:47:33,389 --> 03:47:40,129
and I'm going to just do it very, very closely. I'm going to just defend and then all hell is

1959
03:47:40,129 --> 03:47:45,149
going to break, break loose when five spawn, but let's go. No more talking. Here comes quiet

1960
03:47:45,149 --> 03:48:06,219
gamer time. Don't you have something to say to me? What did I do that for? Oh my God. What happened?

1961
03:48:20,819 --> 03:50:19,280
We go. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm good. If you choke, I'll delete my account. Well,

1962
03:50:19,280 --> 03:50:29,459
uh, it almost happened. What are the diamonds do for you? Anyways, I'm glad you didn't have

1963
03:50:29,459 --> 03:50:47,680
to delete your account, dude. All right, let's move on. It's for upgrades. Ooh, special upgrades.

1964
03:50:48,319 --> 03:51:04,940
Get a good refresh here. Uh, gain 20% movement speed for, yeah, why not? Whatever. All right.

1965
03:51:04,940 --> 03:51:16,399
This is how far I got last. I got to the Minotaur last time. Acorn. The final encounter in each

1966
03:51:16,399 --> 03:51:23,549
underworld region. Take zero damage for the first three times you get hit. That's pretty big too,

1967
03:51:23,549 --> 03:51:37,250
though. This thing about getting hit once is bad. Getting hit like more than twice is bad. I took

1968
03:51:37,250 --> 03:51:44,579
one hit from the boss and took 20 damage. If I have revived with 50 damage, 50 health, wouldn't

1969
03:51:44,579 --> 03:51:59,680
it just be better to block 60 damage? Just don't just, if I get hit from a boss, that's cool though.

1970
03:52:00,239 --> 03:52:11,170
Tooth is at 75. Oh, right. Because I, I've been playing and I upgraded it. Okay. All right,

1971
03:52:11,170 --> 03:52:24,670
I think I'm ready. Let's go. I think the boss is Medusa. It looks like it could be Medusa.

1972
03:52:25,389 --> 03:52:43,500
Could be. Let's beat that Minotaur. Let's beat the Minotaur. Key. I want to be able to unlock

1973
03:52:43,500 --> 03:53:08,129
the spear. Don't come back here. Oh my God. What did he hit me with? Holy shit, dude. I'm getting

1974
03:53:08,129 --> 03:53:15,569
way too confident. Stay back and play the way with the shield you're supposed to play. That's

1975
03:53:15,569 --> 03:53:46,610
what's hitting me. Okay. The shield was gone for so long. Oh my fucking God. Why? Why? Jesus,

1976
03:53:46,610 --> 03:53:54,340
that took, that was so stupid. I took like 30 damage for no reason. Whoa. All right, relax.

1977
03:53:54,979 --> 03:54:47,579
Give me money. Watch out for that shit. Give me the shield back so I can kill him. It's a new enemy.

1978
03:54:47,579 --> 03:55:02,159
I don't know what that does. Oh, it's the butterfly thing. Okay. Fuck, just hit me.

1979
03:55:20,459 --> 03:55:27,870
Dang. I need to heal. He's forgetting. He's forgetting to breathe. I'm sorry. All right.

1980
03:55:27,870 --> 03:55:38,299
Good. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. He forgot to breathe. Yes. Thank God. Here's the fee.

1981
03:55:38,299 --> 03:56:08,510
This one's cheap. Zeus or the cheap pomegranate. It's a random. Oh, that's why somebody's talking

1982
03:56:08,750 --> 03:56:27,440
about giving me Bitcoin. I feel like this is necessary now because now that's jolt.

1983
03:56:27,440 --> 03:56:34,659
My special does, yeah, let's do this. The special now, I can actually do it. It's better. Okay. I'm

1984
03:56:34,659 --> 03:56:47,600
going health. You don't have jolt. I don't? Oh, wait. I don't? Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure?

1985
03:56:47,600 --> 03:56:59,260
Come on. What? Don't I? Your lightning effects also make foes jolted. Yeah, I do. My special is

1986
03:56:59,260 --> 03:57:06,270
a lightning. Is it my special lightning? Somebody has a fucking crosshair on me.

1987
03:57:06,909 --> 03:57:20,719
I'm trying to hit the stupid thing. I want to hit the bomb. I'll do it myself.

1988
03:57:41,260 --> 03:58:20,879
Come up. Holy fuck. Not yet. Oh my God. Get him. Yes. Extra HP. What's this? What are the choices

1989
03:58:20,879 --> 03:58:35,010
here? Hammer or Zeus? No. Poseidon extra. Always hammer, right? Every time. Chariots.

1990
03:58:35,010 --> 03:58:47,329
Chariots. Chariots are alive. Well, they're going to have to catch me, aren't they?

1991
03:59:10,079 --> 03:59:21,790
You can deflect that shit back. Don't forget that, Jeremy. Hammer. Your bull rush gains a

1992
03:59:21,790 --> 03:59:29,940
power rush that deals 500% damage. Your special deals 50 damage to foes around you when you catch

1993
03:59:29,940 --> 03:59:41,979
it. Or your dash strikes deals 50% damage in a large area. I mean, what does it do right now?

1994
03:59:44,590 --> 03:59:47,389
How much does... Has anyone seen the numbers? I haven't really been paying that much attention.

1995
03:59:48,829 --> 03:59:59,979
What does it actually do? You need to time it for the power rush. Oh. One requires actual skill.

1996
04:00:00,620 --> 04:00:09,409
Okay. So besides the passive aggressive, you're terrible at everything. What's the best one to

1997
04:00:09,409 --> 04:00:34,819
do? What do you think? Probably this one. Yeah, that works. Key. How do I get that off? How do

1998
04:00:34,819 --> 04:00:55,739
I get the cursor off me? What does it do? What does it mean? Oh, I'm very powerful right now.

1999
04:00:56,379 --> 04:01:36,559
Get that cursor off me. Oh, the stupid lightning rod things. I'm okay. I'm okay.

2000
04:01:43,170 --> 04:01:51,440
Pomegranate. That's... Pomegranate. It's double, I know, but I have to fight a bunch of horrible,

2001
04:01:51,440 --> 04:02:01,299
scary things. Don't need it. I don't need it. Double, do double, duo, double. No, but I don't

2002
04:02:01,299 --> 04:02:32,000
need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. Should I just pick Ares? Just always pick Ares. Your doom

2003
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:38,319
effect deals more damage when applied multiple times. Or your doom effects deal more damage

2004
04:02:38,319 --> 04:02:42,959
but take half a second to activate. Number three. Because I can activate it whenever I want.

2005
04:02:46,299 --> 04:02:54,500
Definitely three. I'm taking three, man. 60% more doom damage?

2006
04:03:03,459 --> 04:03:15,870
Okay, here we go. Holy shit.

2007
04:03:33,969 --> 04:03:41,069
Holy fuck. Oh my god.

2008
04:03:54,659 --> 04:04:11,200
I still have no health. You're attacking its chain lightning when you damage a foe

2009
04:04:11,840 --> 04:04:17,950
after you dash just before getting hit. Or your cast is a burst of chain lightning that bounces

2010
04:04:17,950 --> 04:04:28,620
between foes. I mean, yeah, I'll take the cast. Yeah, all right, we're good. I need money or health.

2011
04:04:29,180 --> 04:04:38,510
No, I'll do Hermes. Do I have enough? I have enough. Yeah, I have enough money to buy

2012
04:04:38,510 --> 04:05:09,360
whatever I need. I'm doing Hermes. What did I really miss? That dash to activate the doom is

2013
04:05:09,360 --> 04:05:32,739
incredible. All right, Hermes, give me some. Is that rare Hermes? I think that's a rare Hermes.

2014
04:05:36,930 --> 04:05:44,059
Oh, okay. After you dash, you become sturdy and can move 100% faster. Each time you enter a

2015
04:05:44,059 --> 04:05:54,049
chamber, you get money. Or you can... Yeah, these are all terrible. Probably this one. This is going

2016
04:05:54,049 --> 04:06:01,600
to mess me up. This is not good for me. I'm going to dash and I'm going to go too fast and walk into

2017
04:06:01,600 --> 04:06:23,950
something. I know me. I know myself. Trust me. It's not good for us. All right, chop. Here we go.

2018
04:06:24,670 --> 04:06:35,659
Yes. Okay. Give me the meal. I can use this. Nice. All right, here comes the boss.

2019
04:06:36,909 --> 04:06:53,629
I've never fought this boss before. Do I just do all these? I could just do them all. Okay.

2020
04:07:00,100 --> 04:07:05,299
Gain when you pick up that. Gain max life when you pick up any of those. That's probably what

2021
04:07:05,299 --> 04:07:11,409
I'm going to do. Bonus damage per fountain. Using a fountain restores all health and gives

2022
04:07:11,409 --> 04:07:23,569
you damage. It's this one. That gives me full health. Well, pretend full health and then

2023
04:07:23,569 --> 04:07:39,440
whatever this is. Verse of pain level one. Okay. I don't know what that does. What is it? Verse

2024
04:07:39,440 --> 04:07:50,139
of pain level four. Oh, shit. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Here's the boss. You ready?

2025
04:07:52,659 --> 04:07:56,500
See if I can beat this boss. I'm going to be very careful here.

2026
04:07:56,739 --> 04:08:05,360
Looms tall, rousing prince. As if to goad him into such a competent. Cheers for the vote of

2027
04:08:05,360 --> 04:08:19,229
confidence, old man. Here we go. Wait, it's the Minotaur. Beware you face a foe more terrible

2028
04:08:19,229 --> 04:08:27,709
even than the only foe whom I've ever faced who bested me. Is that Hercules? Fiend, you'll walk

2029
04:08:27,709 --> 04:08:36,129
not one more step toward the light of day. So long as I am here. Theseus, no way. You two are

2030
04:08:36,129 --> 04:08:43,569
legends. I'd be honored if we had a sporting contest here. Ah, a naked attempt to sway me

2031
04:08:43,569 --> 04:08:48,290
from my convictions. Defend yourself. Defend yourself, you blaggard. And may the gods show

2032
04:08:48,290 --> 04:09:12,479
you some mercy, for I shall not. It's kind of unfair. Holy fuck. Oh, shit. Okay, I get it. All

2033
04:09:12,479 --> 04:09:40,239
right. This is don't say it. I was going to get this 05 subs. Shit. Run into something, you fucker.

2034
04:09:54,159 --> 04:10:18,579
Run into this pole. Oh, my God. Please let me do a pole. What's going on here? What's going on?

2035
04:10:18,579 --> 04:11:07,979
What the fuck? Holy fuck. I'm in trouble. Oh, bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me

2036
04:11:07,979 --> 04:11:51,760
back. Oh, yeah. Oh, that was tough. I got a super juice. A super juice. What? Oh, I think this is

2037
04:11:51,760 --> 04:12:14,780
regular one. Wait, this is different. Cool. All right. Who's that? Is that the king? Oh, up to the

2038
04:12:14,780 --> 04:12:40,850
left. What? Look, you have a fan. I do? Red guy? That's my only fan. I just beat the two strongest

2039
04:12:40,850 --> 04:13:00,510
guys in the Coliseum. That's bullshit. That was crazy. Is there anything new? No. I only have 20.

2040
04:13:00,510 --> 04:13:05,739
Wait, is that enough to heal? No. That's expensive, but that's really good.

2041
04:13:13,170 --> 04:13:26,340
Sell something for it? Hold on. What should I sell? I don't think I can sell enough to do that.

2042
04:13:26,899 --> 04:13:35,409
Don't, don't, don't, don't. I want, I want. All right, so I have one more of these left.

2043
04:13:36,049 --> 04:13:46,579
Is it worth switching it up now or just stay with what I know? All right, well, let's go.

2044
04:13:52,319 --> 04:14:05,790
We're getting closer. What have we got? The Temple of Sticks.

2045
04:14:18,100 --> 04:14:21,940
Somebody said, I swear to God, if he beats this game in fucking four attempts.

2046
04:14:28,079 --> 04:14:44,510
I don't, I highly doubt that will happen. Wait, I have to fight Cerberus? I told you I was gonna

2047
04:14:44,510 --> 04:15:04,879
have to fight Cerberus. Am I at the end of the game? This feels like a last area. Kill, I have to

2048
04:15:04,879 --> 04:15:14,239
fight the dog. All right, let's fight the dog. Let's go.

2049
04:15:15,840 --> 04:15:23,969
No, but seriously, boy. Oh, I know why you're here. There has to be a way to make you look the

2050
04:15:23,969 --> 04:15:28,770
other way. What if I helped you with the satyr problem? Would you let me go? He doesn't even care.

2051
04:15:28,770 --> 04:15:32,930
Yeah, I do. I have to find Persephone. Oh my God, a human, thanks to the five community subs.

2052
04:15:32,930 --> 04:15:42,020
You know what this means to me? Men's hesitation and ration. A racious hound of

2053
04:15:42,020 --> 04:15:48,799
ox wants prince who sets off in search of something that can say to the monster's appetites.

2054
04:15:48,799 --> 04:15:55,299
Humans out, humans out, humans out. Okay, now I just need to head out the beaten path here and

2055
04:15:55,299 --> 04:16:01,860
see what I can find. I have to find like a treat for him? Well, there's a lot of choices here, hold on.

2056
04:16:02,819 --> 04:16:12,079
Oh, uh, are you sure this is not the, this is like a last, is it, what? Are you sure this is not like

2057
04:16:12,079 --> 04:16:25,579
the final area? I don't have any money to buy anything. Okay, um, I guess we're going this way.

2058
04:16:30,530 --> 04:16:39,649
Uh, I think I want the health. Yeah, I need the health, but that's a soup. This is the hard,

2059
04:16:39,649 --> 04:16:56,159
this is a super hard one. Probably money. Should I get money? I'm going for it. Fuck it. I'm going

2060
04:16:56,159 --> 04:17:10,530
for it. I'm poisoned. How do I take the poison off? How do I get the fucking poison off? How do

2061
04:17:10,530 --> 04:17:26,420
I get the poison off? Cure. God, I didn't know. I didn't know. I don't get the health. I have to

2062
04:17:26,420 --> 04:17:35,469
keep going. God damn it. You don't, fuck it. I'm just going to do this shit. You want to play games?

2063
04:17:36,510 --> 04:17:55,899
I'm not playing games. What hit me? What hit me? This area is way too small.

2064
04:18:03,260 --> 04:18:09,059
Cure that. Cure it. Cure it. Oh my God. This is so, dude, this area is tiny.

2065
04:18:09,780 --> 04:18:41,409
Grats. I don't know what I'm doing, but it's working. Okay. God damn it. Holy shit, man.

2066
04:18:41,409 --> 04:18:55,069
They all bounce the fuck around. Holy God. All right, we got to go in now. Health. I needed one

2067
04:18:55,069 --> 04:19:05,649
of those. Fuck. Okay. Shit. I need to do this, right? I have to. Oh, but I wish I had money.

2068
04:19:06,209 --> 04:19:14,500
I wish I had money. No, I don't have any money. I can come back to life one more time. Okay.

2069
04:19:15,219 --> 04:19:31,260
Come on. What the hell is this? That's just a tiny ghost. I need vermin. Where is he? He

2070
04:19:31,260 --> 04:19:53,340
teleports around. All right, be easy. Where is he? He's inside. Holy shit. He just killed me. All

2071
04:19:53,340 --> 04:20:19,659
right. I'm coming back. I'm back. I'm back. He moves so weirdly. He's teleporting around.

2072
04:20:20,219 --> 04:20:51,920
What the fuck? Here come rats. All right. Just dodge around. Just move. Don't be an idiot. He's

2073
04:20:51,920 --> 04:20:57,920
going to run at me freaking crazily. Heal that shit. Where's the pot? Where's the pot? Where's

2074
04:20:57,920 --> 04:22:00,290
the heal pot? Where's the heal pot? Where's the heal pot? I'm dead. Fuck. I am unstoppable.

2075
04:22:03,500 --> 04:22:22,819
So vicious yet so tiny. Okay. Now what? What happened to this guy? That was a really cool fight.

2076
04:22:22,819 --> 04:22:34,370
Okay. So now I go back. I have health. I have money now. So I can buy. Okay. What's this? What's

2077
04:22:34,370 --> 04:22:46,559
the anvil do? I can buy this health. What? Should I save it? Can I replenish? Athena. Athena. Athena.

2078
04:22:46,559 --> 04:22:53,979
Athena. I don't know. This is high. This is very high risk. I'm not sure what to do. Wait for the

2079
04:22:53,979 --> 04:23:01,899
refill. Athena has a replenish. Does she? All right. Should I go for the roll? Should I roll

2080
04:23:01,899 --> 04:23:16,559
for Athena replenish? Okay. Here we go. One, two, three. Gamble. Come on. We got to gamble.

2081
04:23:26,030 --> 04:23:36,959
Yes. We got it. Reflenish. One use. I got it. Hell yeah. And when I come back to life,

2082
04:23:36,959 --> 04:23:45,649
I've been vulnerable for two seconds. Let's go fill it back up. I'm ready. Come on. Oh,

2083
04:23:45,649 --> 04:23:51,309
I have to do. I'm going to do the money door? All these tunnels. Yeah. I'm doing money door.

2084
04:23:51,309 --> 04:24:30,079
Obviously. Go. Money door. Don't get poisoned. I'm very bad at getting away from the poison.

2085
04:24:30,079 --> 04:24:50,909
I don't even know what these things do, but just kill them. Money. Site of storage. What's that?

2086
04:24:50,909 --> 04:24:56,340
That's a big sack of money versus a little coin of money. I don't know which one.

2087
04:24:56,340 --> 04:25:08,350
This is a restore 34. Okay. Hold on. I can take them both. Go with your gut. I don't wait. Can I

2088
04:25:08,350 --> 04:25:23,520
do them all? I can take this. All right. I can take them all. Again. Oh my God. I have $272.

2089
04:25:24,799 --> 04:25:43,680
Okay. Hold on. I want to spend this. Anvil or health. I don't know. I think it's going to be

2090
04:25:43,680 --> 04:25:54,020
health. I think it has to be health. Let's go. Okay. I wait. Okay. Here we go. Talk to the dog

2091
04:25:54,020 --> 04:25:59,100
now. Go back in for more money. That's a dangerous game that you want me to play.

2092
04:25:59,739 --> 04:26:08,190
That's a dangerous game you want me to play. I have a, I have a revive and I have 140 health.

2093
04:26:08,190 --> 04:26:19,299
I got your favorite treat, but you have to promise to let me pass if I ended over. Okay.

2094
04:26:19,940 --> 04:26:21,379
All right. I'm going to fucking zone in here.

2095
04:26:36,610 --> 04:26:45,709
All right. Let's relax a little. Go in. Here we go.

2096
04:26:53,020 --> 04:27:09,500
Let's go. I'm ready. I'm going to fight him here. This is tiny.

2097
04:27:15,579 --> 04:27:23,340
I suppose you must prefer it to the air below. You know, you're right. The air up here seems

2098
04:27:23,340 --> 04:27:28,530
pretty good so far, but I will reserve judgment until I've had my fill. I have to say though,

2099
04:27:28,530 --> 04:27:35,010
father, the helm of darkness suits you and touched. You dust it off on my account. It

2100
04:27:35,010 --> 04:27:40,610
should not have had to come to this for all your antics with me at around the house. I always kept

2101
04:27:40,610 --> 04:27:46,209
my temper. Have I not felt like you? It's your nose. It's your face. And then I'm going to be

2102
04:27:46,209 --> 04:28:07,940
dead silent. She flies all over my face. Get him off. He's nervous. I mean, kind of,

2103
04:28:07,940 --> 04:28:17,459
I'm at the last boss. I'm all right. I'm all right. Here we go. I skipped the lore. Who cares?

2104
04:28:36,139 --> 04:28:40,209
Me. You'll understand then why I wear the helm of this.

2105
04:28:48,260 --> 04:29:27,489
Where'd he go? Don't make me laugh. It's the last encounter.

2106
04:30:58,659 --> 04:31:53,149
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I know that I'm not going to celebrate prematurely.

2107
04:31:53,309 --> 04:32:03,229
I don't know about this. I don't know about this. There's always a second phase. Of course,

2108
04:32:03,229 --> 04:32:32,239
there is. I thought I had it. I was like, yeah, let's go. Damn it. Oh, man. Shit. Of course,

2109
04:32:32,239 --> 04:32:41,139
he's got a second phase. God damn. Damn it. I'll take it. I'll take it.

2110
04:32:48,420 --> 04:32:59,309
I've never seen anything like this. Don't want to talk about it. Wait, I give her the gift,

2111
04:32:59,309 --> 04:33:11,790
right? Why not? Surprise. Hypnos. I got you this. Oh, you can't bring that in here.

2112
04:33:12,349 --> 04:33:24,139
Just kidding. Thanks. But wait, I'll trade you. Look. Don't say SCP 2521. This did. She is hypnos.

2113
04:33:24,139 --> 04:33:36,049
Coin purse. Well, dad's not even here. Yeah, of course. I'll take it though. That was fun.

2114
04:33:36,529 --> 04:33:42,930
I really thought I had it, too. Yeah, you never actually have it, right? Achilles, is it really

2115
04:33:42,930 --> 04:33:47,330
true that Cerberus ripped the lounge up right after I left? He must have gotten in a lot of

2116
04:33:47,330 --> 04:33:53,860
trouble. I only wish you could have seen it, lad. The place looked like a vineyard after a typhoon.

2117
04:33:54,500 --> 04:33:58,580
Your lord father was in it. Oh, I haven't even unlocked the fourth weapon. I should probably

2118
04:33:58,580 --> 04:34:06,209
do that. Poor Doosa, though. She's picking the place up. What became of Doosa? She's always

2119
04:34:06,209 --> 04:34:15,099
worried father's going to fire her even without something like this. Come here. You don't like it

2120
04:34:15,099 --> 04:34:28,340
when I pet your other heads, huh? No. Unlock some more things. Yeah. Oh, that's right. I have eight

2121
04:34:28,340 --> 04:34:38,369
keys. It's five keys, right? What do I next went? Hmm. Not a bad idea. What's bound to happen?

2122
04:34:38,369 --> 04:34:45,790
Really? Oh, man. I got. OK, cool. Three potions. My extended family seems an interesting lot.

2123
04:34:45,790 --> 04:34:54,020
That's good. Oh, fuck. I have a lot of these Achilles already gems. I'm getting somewhere with

2124
04:34:57,569 --> 04:35:05,259
it. Oh, not quite. Not quite. All right. I got a lot, though. Let's unlock the next tier.

2125
04:35:06,830 --> 04:35:20,479
Show me something new. Oiling blood. Oh, raise your supply of that. That's that's that's that's so

2126
04:35:20,479 --> 04:35:37,650
that's so necessary. Rip spear. Oh, shit. Oh, well, I'm a shieldy guy. Don't worry.

2127
04:35:40,319 --> 04:35:43,759
Gift the dog. Yeah, well, I'm going to I'm going to go give gifts to everybody. I didn't give gifts

2128
04:35:43,759 --> 04:35:56,540
to gift the dog for you, boy. As one of Cerberus's heads receives the prince's gift,

2129
04:35:57,099 --> 04:36:01,740
another muzzles something back into his hand. Spear sucks compared to the shield. Really?

2130
04:36:04,860 --> 04:36:21,200
Old spike collar. OK. Also, I can do this. Add a fountain chamber. Ambers may contain urns with

2131
04:36:21,200 --> 04:36:32,349
five coins or fountain chamber. I'll put a fountain chamber in Elcium. I probably should

2132
04:36:32,349 --> 04:36:43,549
put a fountain chamber in. I should do that first, right? Fountains first. Let's make it happen. I

2133
04:36:43,549 --> 04:36:51,330
have to keep an eye out for this next time out. Those rooms are so important. Underworld Innovation

2134
04:36:51,330 --> 04:37:02,180
Fountains provides 10 percent more health than usual. Elysium. Oh, whatever. You're asking price

2135
04:37:02,180 --> 04:37:09,599
good contractor. Well worth the fruits of your hard work, I'm sure. OK, now let's go give some

2136
04:37:09,599 --> 04:37:15,310
more gifts. Who have I not given a thing to? Hades? Anybody up here haven't given this to?

2137
04:37:15,950 --> 04:37:24,240
I didn't give one to Hades. He's not here anymore, though. Did I give one to...

2138
04:37:24,880 --> 04:37:39,090
Does it say if I... Oh, it does. OK. Poseidon. Holy shit, a lot of people need it. Did I give one to...

2139
04:37:39,889 --> 04:37:56,700
Where is he? Achilles. I did not give one to Achilles. Give me your treasure.

2140
04:37:56,700 --> 04:38:03,939
Hey, Achilles. Look, this really isn't much, but here. This really is for me. You beat me to it,

2141
04:38:03,939 --> 04:38:12,419
then. As I had meant to give you this when next we spoke. Please, take it. What is it? Thanks so

2142
04:38:12,419 --> 04:38:24,750
much, sir. A bracelet of some sort. All right, I still have another one to give. I gave one to...

2143
04:38:24,750 --> 04:38:34,529
Should I give a second one to Skeleton? You can give up to three, it looks like, right? Is there a

2144
04:38:34,529 --> 04:38:40,240
reason to... Is there not reason you shouldn't do it? What have we got? Let's see what that one does.

2145
04:38:40,240 --> 04:38:48,880
Receive 100 coins to spend as you please once per escape attempt. What? So if I put this on,

2146
04:38:48,880 --> 04:38:59,709
I get 100 coins in the first floor. Is that every new floor, or is that just the start of each game?

2147
04:38:59,709 --> 04:39:07,330
Just once. So you just put this on and then take it off. OK. Take minus 20% damage from the front,

2148
04:39:07,330 --> 04:39:21,759
but take plus 10% damage from the back. Ugh. And this is just plus 25 added health. Well,

2149
04:39:21,759 --> 04:39:26,000
we'll just put this on and then take it off when we... Because I shouldn't be dying, right?

2150
04:39:28,430 --> 04:39:44,369
What do you want to talk to me? Next.

2151
04:39:45,250 --> 04:39:50,930
That pal is nobody's business but my own. Besides, it's impolite discussing money out of time.

2152
04:39:50,930 --> 04:39:54,529
Now, back to beating me to powder. Pyrus? Oh, if it was Papyrus, it'd be,

2153
04:39:54,529 --> 04:40:00,610
that pal is nobody's business but my own. Besides, it's impolite discussing money all the time.

2154
04:40:00,610 --> 04:40:16,819
Now, back to beating me to powder. Don't do that again. Oh yeah, I forgot. Everybody has their,

2155
04:40:16,819 --> 04:40:21,939
like, their way that he talks. And how dare you talk a different way than what's in my head? How

2156
04:40:21,939 --> 04:40:37,869
dare you? Uh, are there two other weapons? Or is that DLC coming up or something? Um,

2157
04:40:37,869 --> 04:40:44,770
I kind of want to... I know that I just almost beat the game with the shield, but, you know,

2158
04:40:44,770 --> 04:40:51,150
I thought, I want to play some, I want to change it up. Let's go back to the bow.

2159
04:41:04,349 --> 04:41:10,880
Bow users in chat. Yeah, I'm one of them. Count how many times I've gone up to the top left

2160
04:41:10,880 --> 04:41:24,740
thinking I could leave. Let's try, whatever. If I die in the first room, who cares? Whatever.

2161
04:41:24,740 --> 04:41:31,389
Fuck the bow and fuck bow users. Okay. Oh wait, I give Poseidon a gift, right? I didn't give him

2162
04:41:31,389 --> 04:41:47,779
one, did I? Maybe I did. I did already. I didn't, did I? I don't remember. Nope, I haven't. Hey,

2163
04:41:47,779 --> 04:42:15,779
here. Take this. I gave one to Dionysius, right? I'm gonna press escape and hit give up to get a

2164
04:42:15,779 --> 04:42:30,619
secret. Why? All right, what's the gift? I'm not gonna do it. Is it like a racist save file or

2165
04:42:30,619 --> 04:42:39,549
something stupid? It's no use. Oh, I didn't even take the gift. I didn't even grab the thing.

2166
04:42:44,380 --> 04:42:50,770
To see if you were worthy. And you are. My aid is yours. So call me if you need anything,

2167
04:42:50,770 --> 04:42:53,009
especially to smash your enemies to bits.

2168
04:42:56,240 --> 04:43:04,099
Well, your call makes you surge into foes while impervious for 1.2 seconds.

2169
04:43:04,740 --> 04:43:16,049
What the hell is this thing? 350 damage max gauge bonus. Press RT. I don't know. Let me

2170
04:43:16,049 --> 04:45:51,869
pee first. So whatever happens here, this is probably gonna be the last run because I have

2171
04:45:51,869 --> 04:46:00,430
an appointment. I need to get to an appointment later this evening. Part of the reason why I

2172
04:46:00,430 --> 04:46:17,979
started at like noon. So let's go. So this thing is this is okay. This is a new move entirely.

2173
04:46:17,979 --> 04:46:25,220
Press RT for an Olympian's aid if you have such a boon. Uses one stock of your god gauge

2174
04:46:26,299 --> 04:46:47,490
for all four stocks for a much stronger effect. So I have a new meter. So RT uses it. Holy shit.

2175
04:46:48,209 --> 04:47:05,409
I didn't even have all the moves in the game. Are you kidding me? Oh dear god. If you max it,

2176
04:47:05,409 --> 04:47:14,209
it lasts longer. That's a 350 damage. Wait for it to be max and do it in bosses. Oh my goodness.

2177
04:47:14,770 --> 04:47:36,900
I'm looking forward to this. It resets every room. Oh, okay. So it's only for the current

2178
04:47:36,900 --> 04:47:40,419
room you're in. How do you build it? Is there a better way to build it than how I'm doing it?

2179
04:47:40,419 --> 04:47:50,060
Do I have to like string together like perfect or something? That's damage. That's it. Okay.

2180
04:47:50,619 --> 04:48:10,220
Deal or take damage. We're gonna hammer right off the bat. Bring this. I'm getting a... Oh,

2181
04:48:10,220 --> 04:48:15,599
I can't. Don't say it. You know, I don't care. I'll give five more community subs. I don't give a

2182
04:48:15,599 --> 04:48:21,740
shit. Okay. In Binding of Isaac, you know when you have an insane run that lasts a long time

2183
04:48:21,740 --> 04:48:28,880
and you have a ridiculous build that does very specific shit and then you end up winning or if

2184
04:48:28,880 --> 04:48:37,009
you lose, you go back to just shooting regular tears. I was able to dash three times before

2185
04:48:37,090 --> 04:48:41,250
and I was just completely different. It's fucking me up. Whatever. I'll give the five subs. I don't

2186
04:48:41,250 --> 04:49:03,150
care. That's pretty good. Your power shot is easier to execute. Wow. 150% more damage or two

2187
04:49:03,150 --> 04:49:27,229
shots. They're all good. I'm doing this one. Uh, gems. Oh, what the fuck? Wait, what? This is doing

2188
04:49:27,229 --> 04:49:38,049
a lot. That's a lot. That's a lot. That's the most of... Okay. Well, sure. I think this is going to

2189
04:49:38,049 --> 04:50:09,279
be pretty good. That's a new God. I can one shot almost everything. This is insane. I'll kill this

2190
04:50:09,279 --> 04:50:20,779
dude. He's a problem. 100. Okay. If I can do that again and this is going to be an ice shot,

2191
04:50:20,779 --> 04:50:22,700
it better be. I'm going to be very, very upset.

2192
04:50:28,380 --> 04:50:32,700
One way to find out. Then in the name of Hades. Olympus, I accept this message.

2193
04:50:35,889 --> 04:50:41,810
I understand, young Sagrius, that you would seek to leave that bitter darkness for this bitter cold.

2194
04:50:42,369 --> 04:50:48,049
Quite honestly, I fail to see why. You unlocked Demeter before you unlocked Spear.

2195
04:50:48,049 --> 04:50:52,900
You've arrived for plenty of assistance and you soon shall grow fond of it, I think.

2196
04:50:52,900 --> 04:51:08,540
Gilf? That stands for grandmother? Your attack is stronger and inflicts chill.

2197
04:51:09,419 --> 04:51:24,290
Wowee. That's a big wow right there. And it chills. Your cast drops a crystal that fires a beam at

2198
04:51:24,290 --> 04:51:34,060
foes for five seconds. Yeah, but this is going to do like 225 damage a shot. I'm going for just

2199
04:51:34,060 --> 04:51:59,009
straight up single shot death. I want more of this. Why is that? Excuse me. Hold on a minute

2200
04:51:59,009 --> 04:52:17,779
here. Is there armored? That's 203 damage a shot, dude. That's insane. That's the most damage I've

2201
04:52:17,779 --> 04:52:27,090
done this whole entire game and it's the first zone. I'm just going to make that do like 400

2202
04:52:27,090 --> 04:53:07,860
damage a shot. Yes. That's good shit right there, man. Insane. And got health too. Which way? Oh,

2203
04:53:10,419 --> 04:53:38,529
upgraded again. Do it again. Truly an item build for his massive ego. Fucking 145 damage a shot

2204
04:53:38,529 --> 04:54:08,099
and I didn't even get started yet. Hey dad, you're fucked. I typically would be afraid of these guys.

2205
04:54:08,099 --> 04:54:22,159
Let's do it again. Wait. Your special is stronger and inflicts chill. That gives

2206
04:54:22,159 --> 04:54:29,229
chill to my Y and makes it do like 40 damage. While all foes are chill affected, they are 15%

2207
04:54:29,229 --> 04:54:42,380
slowed and decayed. Wait. While all foes are chill afflicted and they take 30 damage every

2208
04:54:42,380 --> 04:54:51,139
second? For how long? For eight seconds? Wait. That sounds insane. Is that as crazy as I think

2209
04:54:51,139 --> 04:55:00,770
it's going to be? So this can stack 10 times and it's going to do 300 damage a

2210
04:55:00,770 --> 04:55:17,900
second if I get it. That's insane. Holy shit. You're going to be a kiting god.

2211
04:55:22,020 --> 04:55:47,900
These guys didn't even get an intro. They're dead. Oh, that guy got an intro. It's so good.

2212
04:55:49,409 --> 04:56:02,509
Guys, I said it was an 89 like an hour ago. It's gone up. It has gone up. Oh, man. Freezing and

2213
04:56:02,509 --> 04:56:23,819
water. All right. I'm going to take, let's take the chill first. Pick Poseidon, please. Trust me.

2214
04:56:28,860 --> 04:56:40,610
Don't. No, I'm taking the cold. I'm going chill. Your dash shoots out a gust that affects chill.

2215
04:56:41,330 --> 04:56:49,419
Okay. So this is just even more chill. Your boons become common, then gain rarity every three

2216
04:56:49,419 --> 04:56:59,439
encounters. Wait, what? Well, I go back to one and then every three encounters they upgrade.

2217
04:56:59,439 --> 04:57:21,060
That's ridiculous. Holy shit, dude. I'm at one. If this is the one to go out on, this is the one to

2218
04:57:21,060 --> 04:57:48,430
do. Oh, my God. I was so busy looking at the amazing damage that I just stood still. Oh,

2219
04:57:48,430 --> 04:57:59,619
what? It's homing. Okay. That was confusing. Use the call. Oh, fuck. I forgot I even had it. I

2220
04:57:59,619 --> 04:58:18,049
didn't even remember I had that. I think I want the random assortment of treasure chests.

2221
04:58:19,099 --> 04:58:30,159
Dash damages foes in an area. Your boons with knockback affects your rupture. Rupture foes?

2222
04:58:32,779 --> 04:58:43,659
But look, I can get a bunch of treasure. Oh, it's an okay. It's a knock. So it doesn't happen here.

2223
04:58:43,659 --> 04:59:01,470
It happens here. All right. A potion or a big chunk of upgradable fluid. If the big chunk is.

2224
04:59:01,470 --> 04:59:44,930
All right. I gotta stop fucking around. Damn, this is so good. Okay. And I have a random

2225
04:59:44,930 --> 04:59:58,459
quest encounter. What are you selling? Sell, sell, sell. What? What do you mean sell? What

2226
04:59:58,459 --> 05:00:15,950
are you selling? What do I do? You said big chungus. Oh, right. Well, I mean, I was just

2227
05:00:15,950 --> 05:00:20,270
replying to what somebody said. Within the depths of Tartarus reside the most wretched of all the

2228
05:00:20,270 --> 05:00:27,259
shades who linger for eternity within whose lord and masters especially unkind. No, it's. What?

2229
05:00:27,259 --> 05:00:31,500
I just. Somebody said it in chat. I'm just responding. Lots of wretchedness to go around,

2230
05:00:31,500 --> 05:00:39,330
I guess. Hello, sir. Do I have any gifts to give? No. You know, prince said I'd not expected to

2231
05:00:39,330 --> 05:00:44,130
run into you again. Not after all this time. Something I missed out on the house or what

2232
05:00:44,689 --> 05:00:50,990
not had much company of late as all. Worst stream and worst game. All right. Actually time that

2233
05:00:50,990 --> 05:00:58,139
person off for five seconds. They have. They are. They are very lost right now. Well, something's

2234
05:00:58,139 --> 05:01:02,380
just about always in this back home, sir. Figured it couldn't hurt to check up on things in Tartarus

2235
05:01:02,380 --> 05:01:08,020
a bit more frequently. Well, I am grateful for it. I am the old boulder there in turn.

2236
05:01:08,659 --> 05:01:12,180
I'm used to going like these stretches on my own, but having visitors from time to time

2237
05:01:12,180 --> 05:01:21,409
would do me well. Have you ever filtered your piss? Uh, no. OK, should I heal? Should I give that?

2238
05:01:23,229 --> 05:01:30,990
Uh, probably the money or should maybe total health. Yeah, that's good health. Certainly,

2239
05:01:30,990 --> 05:01:36,159
highness. Thank you, mate. Five second rule. That was five seconds, right?

2240
05:01:37,549 --> 05:01:45,979
Oh, piss in the Berkey, right? The Berkey. I forgot about the Berkey filter arc.

2241
05:01:51,380 --> 05:02:02,909
Oops. I got so caught up in getting that. Um, all right. So which one should he in the Berkey?

2242
05:02:02,909 --> 05:02:11,020
Pee in the Berkey. Now let's have a look at your supplier, shall we? I really would too. I would

2243
05:02:11,020 --> 05:02:24,740
do it. I would do it. Uh, let's take you. So Hank, actually, that'll be good. That'll be good too.

2244
05:02:25,889 --> 05:02:39,069
That would also be good. I'm going with this one. Health is so good. Health is so important.

2245
05:02:41,500 --> 05:02:52,000
Let's go kill Meg. You never get casts. Who needs it? I got my strong arms.

2246
05:03:00,689 --> 05:03:04,659
Let's freeze the fuck out of this lady.

2247
05:03:12,180 --> 05:03:28,220
You're running from yourself. I can slow you down a bit, I think. No, you can't. I don't know. Okay,

2248
05:03:28,220 --> 05:03:33,340
I thought in the title, I thought that just said mod that guy instead of Megara the Fury.

2249
05:03:34,060 --> 05:04:28,139
What happened? What's going on? Oh, you touched me. You touched me. Too far away. Step on a trap.

2250
05:04:28,779 --> 05:05:02,930
Oh, you analog gamer. Meg, you're not even hard anymore. You were, remember I was like,

2251
05:05:02,930 --> 05:05:08,779
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I'm gonna get killed by Meg. Meg, you're so easy.

2252
05:05:09,500 --> 05:05:28,479
I'm so good. Oh, I just upgraded something. Toxic? She's like goddess of hell. Tell me,

2253
05:05:28,479 --> 05:05:42,349
I can be toxic to satanic individuals? She like drinks people's blood. But I can't say,

2254
05:05:42,349 --> 05:05:56,020
get out of here, you idiot. I'm good. You're a satanist. No, I'm not. I've done so much

2255
05:05:56,020 --> 05:06:05,389
dark energy elimination from me. You are. I'm not. I've removed so many dark energies from me.

2256
05:06:06,029 --> 05:06:16,990
Okay, your special deals 40. I don't want to spend any money. Tooth on. I think I'm good.

2257
05:06:27,659 --> 05:06:44,130
He's gonna have an enema. Yeah, but here's the thing. That's like, that's like a procedure.

2258
05:06:44,130 --> 05:06:49,409
That's like a medical term. Or you could say that's gross. That's a medical term.

2259
05:06:49,409 --> 05:07:04,189
Why are you defending enemas? Spread this. I'm not. I'm just saying that that's a medical

2260
05:07:04,189 --> 05:07:25,459
terminology. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I saw somebody write something funny. I'm freaking out

2261
05:07:25,459 --> 05:07:39,459
because I stepped in the- what? I'm made of ice. Why would I care about that? Ice melts. Ice cools

2262
05:07:39,459 --> 05:07:56,750
down fire. Uh, pomegranate or money? Money. Ice cools down hot liquids. Okay, riddle me this, chat.

2263
05:07:57,840 --> 05:08:06,459
If I had a, let's say like the square footage of this square up here, and I dunked in an ice cube

2264
05:08:06,459 --> 05:08:13,709
that was as big as your house, what would happen? Would that temperature of this lava, would that

2265
05:08:13,709 --> 05:08:21,950
temperature of this hot liquid cool down? Yes, it would melt, but it would cool down. Whatever it was,

2266
05:08:21,950 --> 05:08:48,369
it would make it colder. It would explode. It would not explode. It would explode. It would because of

2267
05:08:48,369 --> 05:09:07,150
the heat. No, it would not. It would not explode. We get a link? Let me see. Who made you the

2268
05:09:07,150 --> 05:09:24,990
psychics professor? Wait, what? You missed something? What did I miss? Remember, you missed an NPC that

2269
05:09:24,990 --> 05:09:38,900
gives free dash upgrade. Location of Bob Hades. What the hell is Bob Hades? Bob Hades? That's not

2270
05:09:38,900 --> 05:09:47,119
even a real person. Bob Hades? Bop-a-deez.

2271
05:09:55,200 --> 05:10:06,029
That doesn't even make sense. What do you mean? Bop-a-deez nuts? What do you mean bop? Like,

2272
05:10:06,029 --> 05:10:16,110
I'm punching you in the balls? What are you talking about? Hey, yo streamer, bop these nuts.

2273
05:10:16,990 --> 05:10:20,110
I don't think I want to do that. I don't think I want to punch you in the balls.

2274
05:10:22,130 --> 05:10:40,180
Hey, bop-a-deez nuts. It's F. Bof? Bof? What word are you trying to say?

2275
05:10:48,029 --> 05:11:07,569
Bofa? Bofa? What is Bofa? Oh, both. Okay, I was like, what is Bofa? Like, what the hell is Bofa?

2276
05:11:07,569 --> 05:11:17,549
Bof supposed to be. Bofa. What is this? I've never seen this before. It was like Bop-a-deez.

2277
05:11:18,189 --> 05:11:20,450
I don't even know. Whatever. I'm gonna buy this.

2278
05:11:32,139 --> 05:11:44,419
Ooh, your special causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby people. Might as well.

2279
05:11:48,450 --> 05:11:52,909
I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna save my bunny. Well, you know what? Let's roll the dice.

2280
05:11:52,909 --> 05:12:06,659
What do we got? Idle dash. Nice. Ooh, nice. Buy the Bunger. Oh shit, what time is it? I got time.

2281
05:12:07,220 --> 05:12:22,779
Have to say the barge of death is never late. Oh, this place sucks. Just dash when I knew

2282
05:12:22,779 --> 05:12:43,569
to and just cause absolute destructive damage. Oh shit. Whoa, that's a lot of people right there.

2283
05:12:44,209 --> 05:13:15,069
Fuck is rough. These guys have the goddamn damage mitigator. I didn't get hit, did I? Oh yeah,

2284
05:13:15,069 --> 05:13:32,509
let's go. Did I give over? I got a rarity upgrade. This is a god build now. Did I give her a gift?

2285
05:13:33,580 --> 05:13:39,220
I have not. Let's give Athena a gift.

2286
05:13:48,220 --> 05:13:48,939
What's this thing?

2287
05:13:56,860 --> 05:13:57,500
Bop-a-deez.

2288
05:14:01,810 --> 05:14:02,529
Owl pendant.

2289
05:14:15,040 --> 05:14:26,669
What do we got? That, what is it? Your special is stronger and can deflect.

2290
05:14:27,700 --> 05:14:41,139
It's gonna replace that. But, okay. Come on. This is just 7% straight up damage. That's pretty good.

2291
05:14:41,779 --> 05:14:52,909
That's good too. You know what? Yeah, I'll take just a straight up just 7% reduction in all damage.

2292
05:14:52,909 --> 05:14:59,810
That's pretty good, I think. Most of the time it's 5. And plus that can upgrade itself, right?

2293
05:15:00,450 --> 05:15:15,630
Every three rooms that might just get grabbed and be 10%. Get out of here. You're nothing.

2294
05:15:16,349 --> 05:15:39,939
Drop, drop, drop. It's a 92 right now, by the way. And potentially still climbing.

2295
05:15:40,580 --> 05:15:56,930
I think I'm going for the health. Go back, go back. What?

2296
05:16:00,209 --> 05:16:07,439
Restore 10% when you enter a chamber. That's pretty good. Go back. Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos,

2297
05:16:07,439 --> 05:16:17,919
chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos. There's chaos down here.

2298
05:16:22,909 --> 05:16:24,509
It's 25 health. What the fuck is this?

2299
05:16:36,369 --> 05:16:42,500
Okay, let's try it. Chaos.

2300
05:16:55,220 --> 05:16:56,099
The god of chaos.

2301
05:16:59,220 --> 05:17:02,259
Of chaos. The most ancient sculptor.

2302
05:17:02,259 --> 05:17:08,139
Who is the god of chaos? And best take all the evidence I find.

2303
05:17:08,139 --> 05:17:14,450
Is there a god of chaos? This is not someone I recognize.

2304
05:17:15,169 --> 05:17:19,650
So in the name of Hades. Hello, may I ask who's calling?

2305
05:17:20,700 --> 05:17:21,500
Gonna be Kronos.

2306
05:17:21,500 --> 05:18:01,630
What are you holding? Earth? Are you trading me one earth or something? What do I have to give you for earth?

2307
05:18:04,270 --> 05:18:04,909
Hopper shot.

2308
05:18:05,900 --> 05:18:07,740
The next three encounters you cannot earn money.

2309
05:18:08,619 --> 05:18:11,500
Afterward your cast deals plus 30% more damage.

2310
05:18:12,139 --> 05:18:16,849
The next four encounters you take 377% damage from traps.

2311
05:18:18,020 --> 05:18:22,659
After you deal 34% more damage. Holy shit.

2312
05:18:23,299 --> 05:18:30,099
Your dash has 50% range. You deal 65% damage. Okay, it's two. It's absolutely two.

2313
05:18:33,259 --> 05:18:33,979
Holy shit.

2314
05:18:34,619 --> 05:18:35,580
A few chambers from now.

2315
05:18:37,810 --> 05:18:39,490
Very, very cool. All right, let's go.

2316
05:18:40,130 --> 05:18:49,979
How much damage does a trap do? It's like 400% of what?

2317
05:18:56,909 --> 05:19:00,529
Try it. It's 40. So it would be, it would kill me instantly.

2318
05:19:01,409 --> 05:19:03,250
Lava counts as a trap. Okay, I gotta be careful.

2319
05:19:09,470 --> 05:19:10,110
What is this one?

2320
05:19:12,080 --> 05:19:16,000
Juremios. In Greek mythology Juremios.

2321
05:19:16,880 --> 05:19:23,979
Pramius, however you pronounce that, possibly meaning short, is a titan of god of rats.

2322
05:19:24,540 --> 05:19:29,099
Juremios is a bad streamer and balding who is most known for being two and a half trillion

2323
05:19:29,099 --> 05:19:33,659
silver in debt to the Olympian gods. His dump truck ass and his delusional

2324
05:19:33,659 --> 05:19:37,020
conversations with hallucinations in his head, collectively known as chat.

2325
05:19:37,580 --> 05:19:42,700
The best part about this is these are hyperlinked.

2326
05:19:42,700 --> 05:19:53,150
His dump truck ass is a link to another article.

2327
05:19:53,150 --> 05:19:56,590
Not dump truck, not ass, his dump truck ass.

2328
05:19:56,590 --> 05:20:03,790
So that means my ass has its own Wikipedia page.

2329
05:20:04,349 --> 05:20:04,830
Interesting.

2330
05:20:11,840 --> 05:20:29,490
This one's, all right, I'm gonna keep going. I gotta like hurry up.

2331
05:20:29,490 --> 05:20:31,889
Mega fucking LOL. All right, I gotta keep going.

2332
05:20:31,889 --> 05:20:34,290
I might have to leave in the middle of this run. I'm not even kidding.

2333
05:20:35,889 --> 05:20:38,209
How much is this meal? 48. That's a lot.

2334
05:20:38,849 --> 05:20:40,299
I don't need it.

2335
05:20:40,299 --> 05:20:42,369
Business.

2336
05:20:42,369 --> 05:20:44,180
Finally, a cast.

2337
05:20:45,889 --> 05:20:51,900
Wait, maybe three. Yeah, three.

2338
05:20:59,229 --> 05:21:01,709
Yeah, I gotta leave very soon.

2339
05:21:02,590 --> 05:21:05,069
I gotta leave soon.

2340
05:21:05,630 --> 05:21:06,990
Um, I love this game, though.

2341
05:21:07,709 --> 05:21:14,240
I'll beat this boss and then I'm gonna call it.

2342
05:21:14,799 --> 05:21:16,270
We'll pick it up again.

2343
05:21:16,990 --> 05:21:26,540
Holy shit, look at this damage. You kidding me?

2344
05:21:27,340 --> 05:21:31,810
He's already hit 50% health almost.

2345
05:21:31,810 --> 05:21:32,369
All right, let's go.

2346
05:21:33,090 --> 05:21:48,180
I gotta be careful here, though. I don't have very many movement abilities.

2347
05:22:00,529 --> 05:22:04,430
Don't kill me. Check the lava.

2348
05:22:04,990 --> 05:22:06,349
No. No, thank you.

2349
05:22:07,069 --> 05:22:07,729
I won't.

2350
05:22:08,290 --> 05:22:20,500
Machine gun.

2351
05:22:20,500 --> 05:22:26,430
All right, last one.

2352
05:22:26,430 --> 05:22:36,529
Shit, I'm taking damage here.

2353
05:22:36,529 --> 05:22:36,930
Oh, fuck.

2354
05:22:37,569 --> 05:22:38,849
Oh, oh my God.

2355
05:22:39,650 --> 05:22:51,340
This is unbelievably powerful.

2356
05:23:09,180 --> 05:23:10,860
Oh, fuck. It's okay.

2357
05:23:10,860 --> 05:23:12,220
I've died.

2358
05:23:12,220 --> 05:23:15,939
Remember, every time I get hurt and die, I have to go.

2359
05:23:17,939 --> 05:23:39,709
All right. What the fuck?

2360
05:23:39,709 --> 05:23:40,990
Oh, there's one idiot left.

2361
05:23:41,549 --> 05:23:52,110
200. 200. 200. 200.

2362
05:24:00,060 --> 05:24:00,560
Hooray.

2363
05:24:01,580 --> 05:24:05,740
That was plus 100. Holy.

2364
05:24:05,740 --> 05:24:06,619
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2365
05:24:06,619 --> 05:24:07,819
Wait a minute. Is that increasing?

2366
05:24:08,380 --> 05:24:10,560
Isn't that like 20 last time?

2367
05:24:11,200 --> 05:24:21,360
Thank you, John, for the five community subs.

2368
05:24:22,180 --> 05:24:24,659
And this is MC for the five community subs, too.

2369
05:24:29,139 --> 05:24:29,860
How much time is it?

2370
05:24:29,860 --> 05:24:30,979
I got a little bit of time.

2371
05:24:30,979 --> 05:24:31,619
I have a little bit.

2372
05:24:31,619 --> 05:24:35,060
I have just enough time to do the three encounters.

2373
05:24:35,060 --> 05:24:38,259
So when I play this like tomorrow, I don't forget about it.

2374
05:24:38,259 --> 05:24:39,540
Step in a trap and die instantly.

2375
05:24:40,099 --> 05:24:43,380
Oh, Slipper's DLC came out today.

2376
05:24:43,380 --> 05:24:45,540
I know a lot of things are around, aren't they?

2377
05:24:46,340 --> 05:24:51,279
I want to see what these are.

2378
05:24:51,279 --> 05:24:55,459
The next boon you find will be from Athena.

2379
05:24:56,400 --> 05:24:58,639
And her blessings have a 10% chance to be rare.

2380
05:24:59,360 --> 05:25:02,819
Next boon you find will be from Poseidon.

2381
05:25:04,080 --> 05:25:05,279
But you can just game this, huh?

2382
05:25:05,919 --> 05:25:09,299
Yeah, I'll keep the tooth.

2383
05:25:09,299 --> 05:25:12,700
I don't have any money to do anything anyways.

2384
05:25:12,700 --> 05:25:13,659
All right. All right.

2385
05:25:13,659 --> 05:25:14,380
All right. All right.

2386
05:25:14,380 --> 05:25:15,020
Let me just do this.

2387
05:25:15,020 --> 05:25:15,659
Let me just do this.

2388
05:25:15,659 --> 05:25:16,380
Let me just get this done.

2389
05:25:17,500 --> 05:25:20,220
I have, what, two more rooms to do?

2390
05:25:20,220 --> 05:25:20,700
One more room.

2391
05:25:21,810 --> 05:25:23,889
Or I instantly die when I step in lava.

2392
05:25:23,889 --> 05:25:24,610
Or step in a trap.

2393
05:25:25,169 --> 05:25:30,830
That must have been pretty good up here.

2394
05:25:36,689 --> 05:25:38,590
Where are you?

2395
05:25:38,590 --> 05:25:39,310
Always hammer.

2396
05:25:39,869 --> 05:25:42,180
Three more rooms.

2397
05:25:42,180 --> 05:25:59,259
Okay. I hate the little assholes that come out of there.

2398
05:25:59,900 --> 05:26:04,139
Oh, don't let him touch anything.

2399
05:26:08,029 --> 05:26:08,990
Who's left?

2400
05:26:08,990 --> 05:26:09,389
Oh, you.

2401
05:26:10,349 --> 05:26:20,049
Who's left?

2402
05:26:20,049 --> 05:26:20,930
Oh, a chariot.

2403
05:26:28,669 --> 05:26:29,470
Don't you dare.

2404
05:26:30,500 --> 05:26:31,540
You know what?

2405
05:26:31,540 --> 05:26:41,540
What do we get?

2406
05:26:42,180 --> 05:26:45,540
Your attack hits up to three foes.

2407
05:26:45,540 --> 05:26:47,540
Dealing plus 15% more damage for each.

2408
05:26:48,180 --> 05:26:50,959
Your special fires four times.

2409
05:26:50,959 --> 05:26:54,990
Or your special pierces foes and deals 400% damage to armor.

2410
05:26:54,990 --> 05:26:55,869
That's pretty good.

2411
05:26:55,869 --> 05:26:56,909
That's the armor breaker.

2412
05:26:56,909 --> 05:26:58,750
But this, I mean, I don't know.

2413
05:26:58,750 --> 05:27:01,490
It's probably one.

2414
05:27:01,490 --> 05:27:03,169
Your attack hits up to three foes.

2415
05:27:03,810 --> 05:27:06,689
Yeah, and more damage, of course.

2416
05:27:06,689 --> 05:27:08,450
The deadliest foe of all.

2417
05:27:08,450 --> 05:27:08,689
All right.

2418
05:27:08,689 --> 05:27:10,450
Only two, two more encounters.

2419
05:27:11,090 --> 05:27:13,680
Okay. Money or Hermes?

2420
05:27:14,959 --> 05:27:16,110
Hermes.

2421
05:27:16,110 --> 05:27:19,549
We've got a good link here.

2422
05:27:19,549 --> 05:27:20,029
All right. Hold on.

2423
05:27:20,990 --> 05:27:22,319
Hold that thought.

2424
05:27:23,279 --> 05:27:26,979
Did I get hit by it?

2425
05:27:26,979 --> 05:27:28,900
Oh, it's because they're on fire.

2426
05:27:28,900 --> 05:27:29,380
Shit, okay.

2427
05:27:30,099 --> 05:27:44,689
Watch it.

2428
05:27:45,250 --> 05:27:50,259
Why doesn't it hit cats?

2429
05:27:51,139 --> 05:28:00,689
What the fuck is hitting me?

2430
05:28:04,430 --> 05:28:05,389
Cats, the music.

2431
05:28:05,389 --> 05:28:16,029
I'm a cavity, I'm a cavity.

2432
05:28:16,029 --> 05:28:18,270
There's no one like me, cavity.

2433
05:28:19,069 --> 05:28:20,270
You're the biggest.

2434
05:28:21,979 --> 05:28:23,020
Anyone seen that movie?

2435
05:28:23,020 --> 05:28:23,659
It sucks.

2436
05:28:24,220 --> 05:28:25,099
But who cares?

2437
05:28:25,099 --> 05:28:27,340
It was like $500 million to make it.

2438
05:28:27,340 --> 05:28:27,979
Can you imagine?

2439
05:28:28,700 --> 05:28:30,720
Whatever my...

2440
05:28:31,279 --> 05:28:32,930
Hello?

2441
05:28:33,330 --> 05:28:34,799
My controller's fucked up?

2442
05:28:35,740 --> 05:28:36,779
Uh, what?

2443
05:28:36,779 --> 05:28:42,529
That was weird.

2444
05:28:42,529 --> 05:28:46,830
Hermes.

2445
05:28:46,830 --> 05:28:47,069
Good.

2446
05:28:52,540 --> 05:28:54,060
Bonus charge one, yeah.

2447
05:28:55,020 --> 05:28:56,740
I mean, you have to.

2448
05:28:56,740 --> 05:28:58,259
I don't even care where the other ones are.

2449
05:28:59,459 --> 05:29:02,240
The other ones could be god powers and I don't care.

2450
05:29:05,810 --> 05:29:07,330
Hermes thighs.

2451
05:29:07,330 --> 05:29:07,729
Whatever.

2452
05:29:09,569 --> 05:29:10,049
Is it...

2453
05:29:10,049 --> 05:29:10,849
Oh my god.

2454
05:29:10,849 --> 05:29:12,689
Okay, here's the...

2455
05:29:12,689 --> 05:29:14,450
We've clicked on the hyperlink, apparently.

2456
05:29:15,169 --> 05:29:20,459
Brother used to see extreme death.

2457
05:29:20,459 --> 05:29:21,819
Jerma's dump truck ass.

2458
05:29:22,720 --> 05:29:25,860
Also known as caboose, a wagon, or a star.

2459
05:29:25,860 --> 05:29:28,900
Is a feature of the Earth's surface visible from Earth's orbit.

2460
05:29:29,700 --> 05:29:32,099
Satellites have captured an image of it below.

2461
05:29:32,099 --> 05:29:35,299
And scientists are still looking into whether or not it can be harnessed

2462
05:29:35,299 --> 05:29:37,869
to create geothermal energy.

2463
05:29:37,869 --> 05:29:41,470
Jerma is still under contractual obligation to make said image an emote.

2464
05:29:44,590 --> 05:29:46,750
You can see it from the orbit.

2465
05:29:53,790 --> 05:29:55,299
What the fuck?

2466
05:29:55,299 --> 05:29:56,020
All right, let's go.

2467
05:29:56,740 --> 05:29:58,459
What time is it?

2468
05:29:58,459 --> 05:30:00,659
But that's a trap, that could have killed me.

2469
05:30:01,470 --> 05:30:02,509
Uh...

2470
05:30:02,509 --> 05:30:03,389
The mirror.

2471
05:30:03,389 --> 05:30:13,900
I won't touch the traps, no matter what.

2472
05:30:14,459 --> 05:30:18,979
Just let them explode.

2473
05:30:18,979 --> 05:30:19,459
On their own.

2474
05:30:20,500 --> 05:30:31,150
Jerma dump one, Jerma dump two, Jerma dump three, Jerma dump four,

2475
05:30:31,150 --> 05:30:33,790
Jerma dump five, Jerma dump six, Jerma dump seven, Jerma dump eight.

2476
05:30:34,750 --> 05:30:43,259
I won't touch that spear.

2477
05:30:47,009 --> 05:30:47,569
Still alive?

2478
05:30:48,529 --> 05:30:54,770
Oh my god, the traps do 5000% more damage.

2479
05:30:54,770 --> 05:30:55,490
What am I doing?

2480
05:30:55,490 --> 05:30:55,889
Be careful.

2481
05:30:56,770 --> 05:31:08,669
My nose is itchy.

2482
05:31:08,669 --> 05:31:09,470
Hold on.

2483
05:31:09,470 --> 05:31:21,330
Watch out!

2484
05:31:21,330 --> 05:31:22,130
Okay, did I do it?

2485
05:31:22,130 --> 05:31:23,729
The curse of chaos has been lifted.

2486
05:31:23,729 --> 05:31:26,930
Okay, now I do 34% more damage.

2487
05:31:27,569 --> 05:31:35,150
Let's go through the others, but it's so damn dark down there.

2488
05:31:35,150 --> 05:31:36,819
You're gonna be late?

2489
05:31:36,819 --> 05:31:37,380
I'm not.

2490
05:31:37,380 --> 05:31:40,580
I got a minute to just get my bearings.

2491
05:31:44,000 --> 05:31:46,720
All right, so here's an interesting thing to do.

2492
05:31:47,439 --> 05:31:49,869
I already have 7% damage reduction.

2493
05:31:49,869 --> 05:31:52,590
When I'm below 40%, that's 17%.

2494
05:31:53,389 --> 05:31:58,139
Using a fountain will restore all your health and give you damage.

2495
05:31:58,139 --> 05:32:01,330
Probably for the best.

2496
05:32:01,330 --> 05:32:01,970
But wait a minute.

2497
05:32:02,689 --> 05:32:04,479
Don't I...

2498
05:32:06,080 --> 05:32:07,919
Is there a fountain even down here?

2499
05:32:07,919 --> 05:32:09,040
Did I even upgrade that yet?

2500
05:32:10,000 --> 05:32:14,209
Restore up to 100 health.

2501
05:32:14,610 --> 05:32:15,169
All right, let's go.

2502
05:32:22,419 --> 05:32:33,490
Watch it.

2503
05:32:33,490 --> 05:32:33,889
Watch it.

2504
05:32:34,450 --> 05:32:48,959
All right, how much did I get?

2505
05:32:48,959 --> 05:32:50,000
52, that's enough.

2506
05:32:51,279 --> 05:32:52,400
So slow, doesn't it?

2507
05:32:52,400 --> 05:32:52,799
I just...

2508
05:32:52,799 --> 05:32:54,240
I got a full health.

2509
05:32:54,880 --> 05:32:58,909
All right, what time is it?

2510
05:32:58,909 --> 05:33:00,270
All right, I gotta go.

2511
05:33:00,270 --> 05:33:01,549
I have to leave.

2512
05:33:01,549 --> 05:33:03,330
But hold on, let me go to the shop first.

2513
05:33:10,049 --> 05:33:11,500
And, um...

2514
05:33:13,250 --> 05:33:13,889
He's defeated.

2515
05:33:17,700 --> 05:33:18,419
Oh, shit.

2516
05:33:18,419 --> 05:33:19,540
Okay, I can level this up.

2517
05:33:22,720 --> 05:33:23,840
450 damage?

2518
05:33:24,930 --> 05:33:25,970
That's pretty damn good.

2519
05:33:26,529 --> 05:33:31,299
Okay, how do I save the game?

2520
05:33:33,680 --> 05:33:34,319
Wait, but hold on.

2521
05:33:34,319 --> 05:33:35,119
I gotta get this part.

2522
05:33:35,119 --> 05:33:36,080
All right, all right, fine, fine, fine.

2523
05:33:36,080 --> 05:33:37,040
All right, all right, I'm done.

2524
05:33:37,040 --> 05:33:37,840
I'm done.

2525
05:33:37,840 --> 05:33:38,909
How do I, um...

2526
05:33:39,549 --> 05:33:44,459
Am I good?

2527
05:33:44,459 --> 05:33:44,939
You can't.

2528
05:33:49,330 --> 05:33:50,450
Clear this chamber to quit.

2529
05:33:51,090 --> 05:33:52,369
Go to the next room and it will save.

2530
05:33:52,369 --> 05:33:52,610
Okay.

2531
05:33:53,729 --> 05:33:54,639
All right, I'm good.

2532
05:33:54,639 --> 05:33:55,040
Let's do...

2533
05:33:55,040 --> 05:33:55,680
I want ice.

2534
05:33:56,479 --> 05:34:05,360
But I want to save...

2535
05:34:05,360 --> 05:34:05,840
Hold on.

2536
05:34:05,840 --> 05:34:07,279
I want to get the ice first.

2537
05:34:07,279 --> 05:34:24,580
This game is...

2538
05:34:24,580 --> 05:34:25,299
I love this game.

2539
05:34:25,299 --> 05:34:26,020
It's very good.

2540
05:34:26,020 --> 05:34:26,900
We're playing this tomorrow.

2541
05:34:27,700 --> 05:34:28,740
I'll see you tomorrow for this game.

2542
05:34:29,540 --> 05:34:46,099
I know what they're doing.

2543
05:34:47,619 --> 05:34:50,430
I feel like I know...

2544
05:34:51,150 --> 05:34:52,669
I know they're regenerating.

2545
05:34:52,669 --> 05:35:05,040
Who's left?

2546
05:35:07,250 --> 05:35:07,810
450.

2547
05:35:07,810 --> 05:35:08,770
That's so much damage.

2548
05:35:08,770 --> 05:35:09,330
It's insane.

2549
05:35:09,330 --> 05:35:10,610
All right, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

2550
05:35:10,610 --> 05:35:11,330
All right, let's do...

2551
05:35:12,450 --> 05:35:13,650
All right, I gotta fix this by tomorrow

2552
05:35:13,650 --> 05:35:14,369
because this is happening.

2553
05:35:14,930 --> 05:35:16,369
I'm losing connection to my controller

2554
05:35:16,369 --> 05:35:17,169
for some reason.

2555
05:35:17,169 --> 05:35:18,720
If that happens in the middle of a game,

2556
05:35:18,720 --> 05:35:19,439
that would be horrible.

2557
05:35:23,099 --> 05:35:25,409
Okay.

2558
05:35:25,409 --> 05:35:31,819
Any health effects are more potent.

2559
05:35:31,819 --> 05:35:33,340
We're so 62 health now.

2560
05:35:33,979 --> 05:35:36,770
Or your cast drops a crystal that fires...

2561
05:35:37,409 --> 05:35:42,060
Oh, that's pretty good.

2562
05:35:42,060 --> 05:35:43,099
And I can do two of these?

2563
05:35:43,099 --> 05:35:46,479
Oh, now that's going to be...

2564
05:35:46,479 --> 05:35:47,439
That's going to be awesome.

2565
05:35:48,240 --> 05:35:50,159
And two of those can go down at the same time.

2566
05:35:50,159 --> 05:35:53,380
That's insane.

2567
05:35:53,380 --> 05:35:56,099
Okay, so progress saved a minute ago.

2568
05:35:56,819 --> 05:36:02,659
So go through here and save progress.

2569
05:36:03,779 --> 05:36:05,299
I have to go now.

2570
05:36:05,299 --> 05:36:06,020
Did it just...

2571
05:36:06,020 --> 05:36:09,150
Did it save already?

2572
05:36:10,479 --> 05:36:11,200
This game is awesome.

2573
05:36:11,200 --> 05:36:12,000
I'll play tomorrow.

2574
05:36:12,000 --> 05:36:13,279
See if we can beat it tomorrow.

2575
05:36:13,279 --> 05:36:24,580
I feel like I'm getting close.

2576
05:36:25,380 --> 05:36:26,979
I will see you later.

2577
05:36:26,979 --> 05:36:28,139
I have an appointment.

2578
05:36:28,139 --> 05:36:28,700
I have to go.

2579
05:36:31,259 --> 05:36:33,180
Or actually, this game is awesome.

2580
05:36:33,180 --> 05:36:33,740
I have to go.

2581
05:36:34,459 --> 05:36:39,569
Or actually, this is medical stuff.

2582
05:36:39,569 --> 05:36:42,689
So I might come up with some interesting scenarios after today.

2583
05:36:43,490 --> 05:36:44,930
I'll see you tomorrow.

2584
05:36:44,930 --> 05:36:46,930
Tomorrow, we're going to start more normally.

2585
05:36:47,650 --> 05:36:49,659
I'll be somewhere around like one or two.

2586
05:36:49,659 --> 05:36:50,380
Two, probably.

2587
05:36:50,939 --> 05:36:51,580
Maybe one.

2588
05:36:52,139 --> 05:36:53,180
Somewhere in that range.

2589
05:36:53,180 --> 05:36:53,680
Two.

2590
05:36:56,340 --> 05:36:58,900
And I do have to leave very, very soon.

2591
05:36:58,900 --> 05:36:59,380
That's why I...

2592
05:36:59,380 --> 05:37:00,180
Let's do the credits.

2593
05:37:04,020 --> 05:37:05,459
Oh my God, I thought the webcam was on.

2594
05:37:06,340 --> 05:37:11,970
Thanks for all the subs, everybody.

2595
05:37:13,150 --> 05:37:14,990
Thanks for your continued support of the channel.

2596
05:37:15,630 --> 05:37:16,750
A lot of you.

2597
05:37:16,750 --> 05:37:17,250
Thank you.

2598
05:37:17,729 --> 05:37:18,900
Look at all these names.

2599
05:37:19,619 --> 05:37:20,740
Butt puncher.

2600
05:37:20,740 --> 05:37:21,380
Butt killer.

2601
05:37:22,180 --> 05:37:24,159
Carbon dioxide.

2602
05:37:30,439 --> 05:37:31,560
Why are you always naked?

2603
05:37:31,560 --> 05:37:32,200
I just don't...

2604
05:37:32,200 --> 05:37:32,840
I don't know.

2605
05:37:32,840 --> 05:37:33,639
I like to not...

2606
05:37:34,279 --> 05:37:36,360
I wear minimal clothing.

2607
05:37:38,369 --> 05:37:41,009
That means pants only.

2608
05:37:41,009 --> 05:37:42,369
Or shorts only.

2609
05:37:42,369 --> 05:37:43,810
If I'm leaving the house,

2610
05:37:43,810 --> 05:37:46,049
if I'm leaving where I'm going somewhere,

2611
05:37:46,849 --> 05:37:49,250
I will put on adequate clothing.

2612
05:37:49,889 --> 05:37:51,009
So for instance, right now,

2613
05:37:51,569 --> 05:37:54,290
I'm about to go put on adequate clothing

2614
05:37:54,290 --> 05:37:57,330
to go to a medical appointment.

2615
05:38:02,200 --> 05:38:02,680
Me too.

2616
05:38:07,729 --> 05:38:09,409
Medical appointment, in quotes.

2617
05:38:16,130 --> 05:38:18,049
Medical appointment at 6 PM.

2618
05:38:18,610 --> 05:38:19,330
Yes, it is.

2619
05:38:24,479 --> 05:38:25,040
Why...

2620
05:38:25,040 --> 05:38:27,119
Wait, medical appointment at 6.

2621
05:38:27,119 --> 05:38:28,159
Why does it have to be in quotes?

2622
05:38:30,310 --> 05:38:31,430
You're going to buy drugs.

2623
05:38:36,819 --> 05:38:37,540
What, you guys...

2624
05:38:37,540 --> 05:38:38,819
You've never heard of a doctor's office

2625
05:38:38,819 --> 05:38:42,919
that's open till like 7 or 8?

2626
05:38:42,919 --> 05:38:45,959
In quotes, medical McDonald's.

2627
05:38:47,959 --> 05:38:48,599
That's weird.

2628
05:38:49,599 --> 05:38:50,400
It's not...

2629
05:38:50,400 --> 05:38:51,200
No, no.

2630
05:38:51,759 --> 05:38:53,360
It's a medical appointment.

2631
05:38:53,360 --> 05:38:54,319
Okay, I'm out of here.

2632
05:38:54,319 --> 05:38:54,880
I'm leaving.

2633
05:39:00,479 --> 05:39:01,919
It's a doctor, in quotes.

2634
05:39:01,919 --> 05:39:03,040
No, I'm getting out of here.

2635
05:39:03,040 --> 05:39:12,759
I have a medical appointment.

2636
05:39:12,759 --> 05:39:15,110
It's a medical appointment.

2637
05:39:15,110 --> 05:39:23,540
No, it's not a casino.

2638
05:39:23,540 --> 05:39:24,819
Medical disappointment.

2639
05:39:34,020 --> 05:39:35,459
Oh man, all right.

2640
05:39:35,459 --> 05:39:36,740
All right, let's get out of here.

2641
05:39:39,080 --> 05:39:44,400
Just go, just go.

2642
05:39:44,400 --> 05:39:45,520
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

2643
05:39:45,520 --> 05:39:46,240
I'm leaving.

2644
05:39:46,240 --> 05:39:58,979
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

2645
05:39:58,979 --> 05:39:59,220
Raid?

2646
05:39:59,220 --> 05:40:02,310
All right, who do we raid?

2647
05:40:02,310 --> 05:40:06,150
I see we got a few people streaming right now.

2648
05:40:06,630 --> 05:40:08,040
Oh, let's go to Star.

2649
05:40:09,090 --> 05:40:12,759
Star is running his game tonight, right?

2650
05:40:12,759 --> 05:40:14,119
The Myriad episode 4.

2651
05:40:16,959 --> 05:40:18,400
I think this is Star made this, right?

2652
05:40:18,400 --> 05:40:19,599
Star like made this game.

2653
05:40:19,599 --> 05:40:21,720
This is his like D&D campaign.

2654
05:40:21,720 --> 05:40:22,599
Yeah, go to Star.

2655
05:40:22,599 --> 05:40:23,159
Let's go, let's go.

2656
05:40:24,360 --> 05:40:25,959
Don't be a fucking asshole though, okay?

2657
05:40:25,959 --> 05:40:26,919
I know a lot of you guys are going to go there

2658
05:40:26,919 --> 05:40:29,060
and be like, D&D!

2659
05:40:29,060 --> 05:40:30,419
He's like running a game right now.

2660
05:40:30,419 --> 05:40:32,099
And it's like, it's a really, really interesting game.

2661
05:40:32,099 --> 05:40:38,819
All right, go be professional.

2662
05:40:39,860 --> 05:40:41,459
You know, whatever, I don't care.

2663
05:40:43,810 --> 05:40:44,529
Uh, go watch.

2664
05:40:44,529 --> 05:40:46,290
It's apparently very interesting.

2665
05:40:46,290 --> 05:40:47,569
I've seen a little bit of it.

2666
05:40:47,569 --> 05:40:48,849
I used the word apparently.

2667
05:40:49,330 --> 05:40:51,250
I have seen at least like an hour of this.

2668
05:40:51,889 --> 05:40:53,509
All right, see you later.

2669
05:40:53,509 --> 05:40:53,909
See you tomorrow.

2670
05:40:54,720 --> 05:40:55,360
Good night.

2671
05:40:55,360 --> 05:40:56,159
Goodbye.

2672
05:40:56,159 --> 05:41:03,250
Yeah, he actually like made this whole thing, right?

2673
05:41:03,250 --> 05:41:06,290
He still got my game to make too.

2674
05:41:06,290 --> 05:41:07,650
So this would be a good opportunity

2675
05:41:07,650 --> 05:41:08,849
to see if it's any good.

2676
05:41:08,849 --> 05:41:12,470
See you tomorrow guys.

2677
05:41:12,470 --> 05:41:13,029
Good night.

2678
05:41:13,029 --> 05:41:13,509
Goodbye.

2679
05:41:13,509 --> 05:41:14,790
Take care of yourselves.
