1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:36,869
Hey, today, continuing from yesterday, we are going to play the part three, or is it part four?

2
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:46,619
I don't even know. Of the FMVs. This is like part five. We've done a lot of them. We may see the end

3
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:55,979
of the FMVs tonight. It's possible. Depends on if this first one is the only real, substantial

4
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:05,060
FMV video game that I have left. There aren't any more after this that are substantial.

5
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:16,250
I still have a couple of other fucking stupid ones, but, you know. And coming up next is the

6
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:29,030
carnival. No, that's next week. What would you do if I just turned off the intro? Then there was a

7
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:35,659
carnival behind me. I pulled it forward a week. I feel like people would be very upset about that.

8
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:45,659
Jerma, what the hell are you doing? I took off work on the 21st to watch this.

9
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:57,459
Oh shit, sorry. But no, the first thing I'm going to do is called Fox Hunt. This is a game made,

10
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:10,699
I think, by Capcom. I think this was on the PS1 as well. Maybe. I'm not 100% sure.

11
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:21,370
But, I got it ready. It's just open. Do you guys want to go? Do you want to see it?

12
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:40,419
You want to see this one? No? All right. Okay, we don't have to. All right. We can sit here.

13
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:53,740
All right. Do you want me to turn the stream off? Do you want me to just go? Should I go?

14
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:08,500
Do you want me? Should I leave? All right. Fox Hunt. There it is. I don't know what to expect,

15
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,139
although how can you expect anything with these games? They're all a fucking mess. It is a Capcom

16
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:20,699
game. There's the logo. The original Capcom logo. That's how you know it's going to be good.

17
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:50,740
Here we go. Let's get a good countdown here. One. What? How does every James Bond movie and

18
00:03:50,740 --> 00:04:07,400
every wannabe James Bond movie have a skiing scene? What?

19
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:22,470
What? Is anybody getting any of this? Why are these guys' hands all burnt?

20
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,170
I know they're speaking English, but I can't understand them.

21
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:58,459
Now we are cooking with gas. Oh, now we're cooking with gas.

22
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:08,680
Grace falls for a schoolteacher, but got amnesia. The teacher that has amnesia?

23
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Can't remember she used to be a stripper. What the fuck is this?

24
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,699
What? Why does this guy have Mickey Mouse gloves on? I don't understand why he's wearing those.

25
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:31,129
I don't understand why he's wearing those.

26
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:59,060
Briefcase switch. These are agents and there's the CD.

27
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,410
This is not exactly less stock for our board codes.

28
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:12,089
Oh, the shit. What the fuck is happening? 1972 height of Cold War. KGB set me up as big time

29
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:17,529
Hollywood producer to create a television show so bad, moral backbone of the United States would

30
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:24,519
break. Movid shows and soon Russians crave the same garbage and Kremlin blame it me for destroying

31
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:31,160
communism. Now I demand screen credit for all my shows or else hidden Soviet nuclear missiles set

32
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:38,199
to launch in 36 hours will cancel Los Angeles in mid-season. And to prove I am now loyal capitalist,

33
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:46,120
you will also pay 100 million dollars cash for disc fit launch abort codes. Idiot. Moron.

34
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,519
Who is he talking to? Don't kill him. He still has disc.

35
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:06,019
What? I had no idea. That's not me. This is me. Was that a TV show thing?

36
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:20,540
I might have just been making that up in my head. All right, reading a book. That's not a book.

37
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,100
Fighting must ward off attacks from vicious frontier morons.

38
00:07:53,689 --> 00:08:07,660
The pacing here is kind of just way off. So there's a Russian agent who's going to

39
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,279
want 100 million dollars. Oh, we have the access. Wait.

40
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:32,309
Okay, I like the control. Controlling is fun. Computer. That's it. I just press W.

41
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:43,750
No, it's S. Okay. S is I don't know how to turn the computer on. How about the lamp? Oh, the phone.

42
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,070
I want my stuff back. Hey, Biffy Wiffy, turn off that video camera.

43
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,139
Is that supposed to be a is that like a friend? Is that. Hey, Jack, freeloader,

44
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,139
Fremont, I know you're there. I can hear you whimpering. Pay up, Mr. Fremont.

45
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,700
Borrow it from your folks if you have to because I'm going to be your touch if your phone is still

46
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:33,929
connected. Jack, darling, which is nicer, your baby brother's new Mercedes or your sister's new

47
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:40,409
Lexus? Anyway, I hope all is well. I love to call your mother. You know, if they paid for watching

48
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:54,470
reruns, our eldest son would be a millionaire. Hang up. Okay. Sure. We had the skiing thing in

49
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:05,450
the beginning. How do we leave the house? TV? No, I want to. What do I have a backpack on?

50
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:23,139
How do they get the backpack? So open the fridge and eat from the fridge.

51
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:42,139
Am I doing this wrong? Do I have to touch the latch or? All right. What do you do? Oh, easy.

52
00:10:43,740 --> 00:11:23,370
It is. Okay. Rob Lowe is apparently in this game. Paid bill may already be a winner.

53
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:46,620
Open it. Collection agency. Tax returns 1988. What? I have no idea what the fuck he's talking about.

54
00:11:46,620 --> 00:12:07,909
Go out the window? What about the pans? No, look over here. Tacos? Is it Christmas?

55
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:21,980
Chocotero tacos. So good. It'll save your life. Jesus. I hate this.

56
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:53,210
This is just like inside the apartment of like a creepy person. Just like a weirdo every day on

57
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:10,539
UBC. I can't read this. This is a Sim's house. It is. Even the way he's spinning his keyboard

58
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:29,899
turning. How do I leave the house? Get me out of the fucking house. No, I'm not looking at

59
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:42,490
it anymore like boobs. All right. Don't forget your keys. Don't, what does it say? Let me break

60
00:13:42,490 --> 00:14:05,419
it in the house. Why am I not paying attention to this guy? Why are they acting like this?

61
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,549
This is just the principal from Billy Madison.

62
00:14:29,379 --> 00:15:20,059
Did you just kill me? I'm pressing one, two, and three. Don't do it! What happened?

63
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,779
I can't, I have no idea what's going on. A guy broke into my house wearing a Donatello from

64
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:40,379
the Ninja Turtles thing on his hair. Look at his eyes. I made fun of him and then we had like a weird

65
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:47,350
play fight and then he jumped out of my fourth story window. That's it. I don't have anything

66
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:56,519
else to add to that. Live! 15 frames a second. It's time for Destiny TV's online game show

67
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:04,360
extravaganza. Here's our first question for our players. What do you say, King? It's Destiny time.

68
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:12,500
What the fuck? Is this an internet cafe?

69
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:42,870
Am I the only one playing this game?

70
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:52,870
What? I walked into a bar and I'm the only person playing the fucking game.

71
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:33,369
I just got syringed. This goes up a full letter grade. This goes up two full letter grades. I got

72
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:40,579
syringed in the neck. This was an F. It's not like a C minus.

73
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:54,819
It's still an F. Not yet. That just went up two full letter grades. You guys don't understand.

74
00:17:54,819 --> 00:18:02,380
A car is one. A syringe in the neck is two. All right, so I just got syringed.

75
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,859
I woke up. Let's see what's in this box.

76
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:20,069
He said that? Yeah, you know, put your right toe in, put your right toe out. You know that one.

77
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:34,170
This is so unsettling. It is. It is unsettling, but I'm intrigued. Is that the Joker?

78
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:46,519
Wheatley, get a load of me. These are like, it's like Truman Show type stuff where he's making TV

79
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:59,400
references every now and again. Open it. All right, how do I? Here comes the fake stomach

80
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:17,539
egg. Let's do it. Wait, hold on. Boxes? Can I open them? Is it going in here? Flowers? Is it food?

81
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:31,740
Cigars? That was pretty, that was pretty good. What? What else is in here?

82
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,279
The classic, the classic. I don't know what this is. I'm going to sneeze into it. I hope I don't

83
00:19:40,279 --> 00:20:08,680
get in any trouble anymore. What about their computer? Can I turn on their computer? Yeah.

84
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:27,819
No, this game was made by a fucking alien. No, back, back up. I don't want to try to turn the

85
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:40,650
computer on again. I'm hungry. He just starts smashing it. What else on the table? Not that

86
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:46,730
I can see it. I have to do that. I go back to the top secret. There it is. How the hell would I

87
00:20:46,730 --> 00:21:13,430
ever have found that? What? What? Give me the top secret thing. I just want to, it says top

88
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:20,390
secret. Just give it to me. It's right here. Stop knocking stuff over and making like Jim Carrey

89
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:35,529
faces and noises and shit and pick up the top secret data. Spies must wash hands before returning

90
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:40,009
to work. Personal hygiene is no big secret. All right. That's like fine. Right? You know what I

91
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:53,880
mean? There's more. They've more stuff in the CAA credit card. Okay. I stole the credit card out

92
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,190
of here. Do I have an inventory? I don't think I even have an inventory. There's more. This guy

93
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:09,339
has more shit in his pocket. Is that a sandwich? Why does this guy have so much stuff in his

94
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:31,779
pockets? You got more stuff in here? Okay. So now we go back to the door. It's a spy weapon. Yeah.

95
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:52,789
But what about where's my inventory? Nuclear missiles, do's and don't. Nuclear missiles,

96
00:22:52,789 --> 00:23:05,190
do's and don't. Well, at least they have a manual. Did I miss something else over here? No.

97
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:13,670
We can just call Washington and tell the director he's a spy weapon. This maniac also has new

98
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:18,309
ward codes to stop Los Angeles from becoming the world's largest barbecue pit. He wants his payback

99
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:21,910
from his shows of the 70s and now you want me to tell Langley that he's bluffing?

100
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:30,789
Hello, Jack. I'm the dealer. I am the croupier. And I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. We

101
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:38,230
apologize for the circumstance, Jack. We're CIA. After the end of the Cold War, we've had cutbacks.

102
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:45,670
Serious cutbacks, Jack. We need you to deliver a briefcase in exchange for a package. Now,

103
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:53,029
if you do this, we will deposit $100,000 in your bank account. It's not that much.

104
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:59,670
Our development will be your contacts. Well, you know, um. That's Dr. Reva levels of under.

105
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:03,990
I'm not a spy. We have reason to believe that the double agent has compromised our security

106
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:13,450
and our identities. We don't need a spy, just a guy. This is going to be dangerous.

107
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:23,450
It sounds great, really. I can't believe my luck. But if I wanted to be filled with lead,

108
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,250
I'd continue to eat the paint off my bedroom walls. We'll give you $500 in advance. Cool.

109
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:34,410
$500? $100,000? No, add a couple of zeros. 20 years ago, the Fox had a kid with one of

110
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,450
those hot TV starlets. A girl. I wonder if she's cute.

111
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:44,730
He's fucking terrifying. This guy's terrifying. Where's the Pessy?

112
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:53,460
Is this the president? Who's the president? Oh dear. There is your CD-ROM reader. You

113
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,569
probably won't need it. I already got one. Not like this one, oh boy. It'll play anything,

114
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:05,049
including coded government discs from any country on earth. Cool. And my vibe has been

115
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:10,250
looking for the wolf. Wow, here you go. It's a wolf. The coolest thing I could possibly

116
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:22,180
fucking hand you. A non-region-locked CD player. Wow. Unbelievable. No, don't-

117
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:38,940
Another cocktail? Wise guy, I'm not sure. Uh-oh, it just went up another two letter grades.

118
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,059
I swear I'll never drink again.

119
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:59,269
Okay, so now I still don't have an inventory though. I think I just have this shit.

120
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:19,609
What is the credit card? Ah, that Global Terminological Threats. Fox. Codenamed the Fox.

121
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:27,369
H-53. Ukraine. National origin. Uh, the king of disinformation. The real name. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

122
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:32,410
So the number one spy during the 70s and early 80s. Ryzenpol's particular former film director.

123
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:37,289
He was enlisted by the Soviet KGB to destroy America by polluting its communications network.

124
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:43,609
During the 70s, he secretly created over half of all American television stories. Storylines and

125
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:48,890
plots or episodes were sent anonymously to the networks where executives took credit and made

126
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:55,049
millions. The Fox was promoted to the rank of KGB Colonel and was eventually one of the only five

127
00:26:55,049 --> 00:27:02,069
men granted access to the launch codes for Russia's nuclear arsenal. The Fox traveled to Los Angeles

128
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:08,789
for a period in the early 70s and hobnobbed with the entertainment elite. There were even rumors

129
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:16,279
of an affair with a young starlet and possibly a child. Interesting. Soviets planned an attempt to

130
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,920
mesmerize America by sinking the level of entertainment so low that national morals and

131
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,599
moral morale would also die. It was a terrible failure. The disinformation plan backfired and

132
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:33,480
eventually Russians desired the same subversive television. His work has been greatly credited

133
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,279
for destroying communism worldwide. Rated extremely dangerous. Rumors abound that the Fox has stolen

134
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:46,200
the launch codes for Russia's remaining nuclear missile. CIA contact made and broken codes may

135
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,720
now be available on the internet for some reason. I thought it said on the internet.

136
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,519
Codes may not be available on the internet on the international black market. Oh,

137
00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:01,750
that is what that is. I'm sorry, it's hard to read because this is like in a small window on

138
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:07,190
my screen and I've blown it up on your screen because I'm trying I have to squint to see this.

139
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:23,960
Okay, enter access code. Wait, these are all hold away. This is a mouse button. Look at all

03:07:57,860 --> 03:08:03,780
me this where is customary in american entertainment for a bad guy to tell good

714
03:08:03,780 --> 03:08:12,040
guy what he's doing just before he kills him he forgot the good guy always wins

715

03:08:58,360 --> 03:09:04,360
the world will experience its most bizarre and horrible nuclear accident yet

720
03:09:05,239 --> 03:09:14,600
a missile will be launched from russia by mistake and 30 minutes later all telecommunications

721
03:09:14,600 --> 03:09:23,159
will be switched from the united states okay it'll work why are you telling me this

722
03:09:23,159 --> 03:09:29,079

791
03:29:04,729 --> 03:29:23,110

795
03:30:11,059 --> 03:30:25,860
i'm gonna go with 40 because i don't know rocket ship same work frankly i haven't got the slightest

796
03:30:25,860 --> 03:30:34,780
idea why don't you just let him go you get in that mobile that guy alone tried to kill me over a

797
03:30:34,780 --> 03:31:29,909
dozen times where the fuck are we right now i am i supposed to be picking i maybe it's the arrow

798

keys left right okay i just pressed right yeah it's the arrow keys why is the top kid coming off

799
03:31:49,459 --> 03:32:00,569
blue the different colored hallways green and red and then what was that

800
03:32:05,610 --> 03:32:11,750
this pops up so fast i can't even shooting at me

801
03:32:28,149 --> 03:32:41,639
um

802
03:32:57,780 --> 03:33:26,579
how do i stop this guy from shooting at me when the guy's in front of you shoot

803
03:33:26,579 --> 03:33:33,510
shoot oh for the love of fucking god you have to hit enter you're not clicking on the screen

804
03:33:33,510 --> 03:33:56,299
what was i shooting in front of me

805
03:34:03,159 --> 03:34:10,440
i pressed all right but who is he where the fuck is he where is this person who is that and where

806
03:34:10,440 --> 03:34:27,510
are you behind me when they're just looking behind so he's behind me so i have to like turn

807
03:34:29,319 --> 03:34:34,729
i can't turn all right once he starts firing i can't do

808
03:34:34,729 --> 03:34:51,319
anything and i can just look behind me what the fuck you have to get out of the rocket and just

809
03:34:51,319 --> 03:35:31,540
wait what is he going is i got green or red what here you go he's firing at me i can't fucking even

810
03:35:31,540 --> 03:35:45,399
see what i'm supposed to be doing here i'm looking i'm looking at the guide look down the tube to see

811
03:35:45,399 --> 03:35:55,899
which way the guy is going what do you see a guy going down a tube right now

812
03:35:58,100 --> 03:36:28,260
where i didn't see shit which tube there's nobody there and now he's behind me the object here to

813
03:36:28,260 --> 03:36:32,020
shoot the bad guys ahead of you and avoid the gunfire from behind the trick is to maneuver the

814
03:36:32,020 --> 03:37:02,540
guys from behind you to in front of you while spinning to avoid their gunfire spinning spin

815
03:37:03,180 --> 03:37:15,930
spinning i this is going too fucking fast man why i can't even make a choice

816
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:52,870
spin huh who is who shoot him

817
03:37:59,579 --> 03:38:52,360
i think i got him spin spin what the fuck no what the this is the most confusing shit and fucking

818
03:38:52,440 --> 03:39:30,700
ever this is this is the wheelchair rockets with guns spins spin how the fuck is this guy

819
03:39:30,700 --> 03:39:40,950
always behind me this is the final scene of the game i have to be as fucking stupid as this is

820
03:39:50,299 --> 03:39:57,579
those last four or five these you couldn't pay me money to tell you what the fuck's happening

821
03:39:57,579 --> 03:40:08,309
right now shoot oh i didn't even press the spin button once i didn't press s one fucking time

822
03:40:09,110 --> 03:40:37,430
this guy is still here why is he still here spin

823
03:40:47,139 --> 03:41:24,139
he's dodging how are you dodging hello what the name is jack jack freemont did he say yak

824
03:41:47,079 --> 03:41:55,799
how the fuck did that even make any sense oh i love this game but i hate this game at the same

825
03:41:55,799 --> 03:42:18,250
time i think this is the end is it one more decision good work jack wait thank you i didn't

826
03:42:18,250 --> 03:42:38,120
stop the the nuke 1966 spring harvest wait didn't you get shot well in another two minutes you won't

828
03:42:50,500 --> 03:42:56,809
okay maybe just one if this ends with the nuclear bomb going off

829
03:42:57,770 --> 03:43:08,620
and great i'm gonna go to los angeles at least we didn't lose the money good show bye

830
03:43:31,079 --> 03:43:45,299
it actually happened they actually did one of the end this multiple ending

831
03:43:50,299 --> 03:44:09,420
how do you get the good ending yeah that's it that was fucking ridiculous

832
03:44:10,379 --> 03:44:23,479
okay that was fox hunt we beat the whole game it was an absolute journey and it was a mess

833
03:44:24,040 --> 03:44:29,850
it was all over the place but you know i i enjoyed my time didn't beat the whole game well i got to

834
03:44:29,850 --> 03:44:36,790
the end i got to one of the ending you have to complete the hospital wheelchair scene on your

835
03:44:36,790 --> 03:44:48,870
first try dude that seriously almost killed me this game is outrageous fox hunt by capcom

836
03:44:49,590 --> 03:44:56,149
weirdly enough i'm still trying to get over the fact that rob low was in the game

837
03:44:57,030 --> 03:45:05,610
for less than five minutes he just in the game and a couple clones this but that must have been

838
03:45:05,610 --> 03:45:10,010
a favor you know he must have known that the dp or something it must have been a personal friend

839
03:45:10,569 --> 03:45:16,579
hey you want to be in this movie this movie game thing for like five minutes just cameo it for fun

840
03:45:16,579 --> 03:45:43,989
yeah sure why not killer soundtrack there you go capcom capcom capcom you're gonna do new game plus

841
03:45:44,790 --> 03:45:47,430
no i'm gonna use the bathroom come back i'm gonna play another one

842
03:45:49,450 --> 03:45:53,770
and unfortunately this is really it's in out of the fryer and into the frying pan

843
03:45:55,370 --> 03:46:00,809
because the next one is there's no i don't there's no relaxing fmv game that i have

844
03:46:01,940 --> 03:46:20,920
from this point going forward we are going to do uh crime patrol two drug wars so there really is

845
03:46:20,920 --> 03:46:31,350
no there's no slowing down here so let me uh bear back i'm just gonna get a water use the bathroom

846
03:46:31,350 --> 03:46:37,540
and we'll keep going do i have the game that has rob schneider in it you're talking about a fork

847
03:46:37,540 --> 03:46:44,659
in the tail i really really wanted it but i had to make a decision because a fork in the tail

848
03:46:45,860 --> 03:46:53,670
seems ridiculous like this but it requires windows 95 so what i had to do it i would have had to

849
03:46:53,670 --> 03:47:03,420
make a new virtual machine for windows 95 to only play that game so i decided to spend time

850
03:47:03,420 --> 03:47:19,180
in the windows 3.1 emulator do it i mean i probably will it's easy well it's not that it's not it's

851
03:47:19,180 --> 03:47:24,760
not that it's hard to do it just there was a shitload of games on the 3.1 and i said all right well

852
03:47:24,760 --> 03:47:28,600
i might as well just focus on this because remember i had to there's a lot of fucking

853
03:47:28,600 --> 03:47:38,840
bullshit that you have to do to get some of these to work and some of them they they don't work even

854
03:47:38,840 --> 03:47:46,780
with uh virtual emulation so virtual machine stuff i tried to get there are a couple other

855
03:47:46,780 --> 03:47:51,100
ones for 3.1 that i tried to get to work and they just aren't going to no matter what i do

856
03:47:53,190 --> 03:48:00,120
like oh you don't have quicktime 1.0 installed i refuse to run but i have quicktime 2.0 installed

857
03:48:00,120 --> 03:48:08,569
that doesn't matter sorry um so i need to go find a win a 3.1 quicktime 1.0 installation file

858
03:48:09,450 --> 03:48:12,489
and then install it and then hope it works but i have to install it on the virtual machine

859
03:48:13,459 --> 03:48:18,819
like i have to go to like a super super duper it's like it's weird and i've done that before

860
03:48:18,819 --> 03:48:45,979
and then the whole vm breaks quicktime 2.0 doesn't exist yes it does this is quicktime

861
03:48:45,979 --> 03:49:03,819
2.1 did somebody did somebody say quicktime 2.0 doesn't exist people what hold on i thought it

862
03:49:03,819 --> 03:49:18,489
didn't exist i thought it didn't exist though i thought it didn't exist please hide this i feel

863
03:49:18,489 --> 03:49:32,569
old i disagree what happens if you disagree does it turn off windows no that's 2.1.2 wait that's

864
03:49:32,569 --> 03:49:44,389
2.1.2 yeah for a second i thought the camera was on and i'm so glad it wasn't that would have been

865
03:49:44,389 --> 03:50:07,559
embarrassing all right i'll see you guys in a minute we'll do uh drug wars see in a second

866
03:50:07,559 --> 03:55:08,379
oh shit his pc turned off i'll be right back relax okay we are no longer playing a fox hunt

867
03:55:09,899 --> 03:55:18,489
so i'm going to change that this is crime patrol 2 let me make sure it's being captured correctly

868
03:55:18,489 --> 03:55:42,010
it is hello same thing i got three difficulties although i'm probably gonna have to i'm probably

869
03:55:42,010 --> 03:55:47,979
gonna have to resize this let me try something here hold on does it stay the same or is it all

870
03:55:47,979 --> 03:56:05,610
fucked up i can't see yeah i gotta change it that looks okay right there maybe a little bit more

871
03:56:05,610 --> 03:56:20,979
yeah that looks all right a little bit more looking good there we go okay turn the volume

872
03:56:20,979 --> 03:56:42,250
on and let's go we should be good right how loud is it probably very loud no it's fucked up

873
03:56:43,450 --> 03:56:52,600
turn it down a little because i can't see it because it changes my resolution

874
03:56:53,500 --> 03:57:09,690
i fucked it all up there we go all right better here we go new game welcome to shearer county

875
03:57:10,250 --> 03:57:15,459
now drugs are something we just don't abide down i say you got six years

876
03:57:16,100 --> 03:57:24,520

1106
05:25:24,229 --> 05:25:41,430
what about i can't select the track qualifying let's go but i don't know why the other why the

1107
05:25:41,430 --> 05:26:16,009
car is on this road 162 miles per hour jesus helicopter can you get arrested why the planes

1108
05:26:16,009 --> 05:26:31,220
flying that low you can't get hit by a fucking plane right are there any other buttons

1109
05:26:43,099 --> 05:27:04,279
i'm almost an 11th gear maybe i shouldn't have done long did i qualify i was in lap two

1110
05:27:04,279 --> 05:27:41,930
right okay i've not stopped going 162 those are rpms not gears yeah see it goes

1111
05:27:43,770 --> 05:27:56,279
i'm in six right zero so what does it mean let me ask you something because you guys that like

1112
05:27:56,279 --> 05:28:03,700
cars what does it mean when your car so let's say you have you have an automatic right you're not

1113
05:28:03,700 --> 05:28:10,580
driving a manual and let's say that you're you know between one and like two rpm right on the

1114
05:28:10,580 --> 05:28:15,619
bar there uh let's say that you like you're going like 20 30 miles per hour and you start to go

1115
05:28:15,619 --> 05:28:21,380
down to like one to two rpm right why is it and they're telling me what was you got somebody

1116
05:28:21,380 --> 05:28:27,299
that knows about cars let me know what you think about this so why is it that sometimes when you

1117
05:28:27,299 --> 05:28:34,700
slow down if anybody's in here that knows anything about cars if you slow down between one and two

1118
05:28:34,700 --> 05:28:49,740
rpm why is it that the um the car sometimes will all right hold on it was the like binaural beats

1119
05:28:49,740 --> 05:28:54,389
in my ears were fucking up my whole brain i couldn't even talk to you guys um anyway so

1120
05:28:54,389 --> 05:29:01,110
when i go in between two and one rpm sometimes i can feel the car like pulling up and down

1121
05:29:01,669 --> 05:29:11,560
uh gears why is that doing that i can feel it it's like

1122
05:29:13,560 --> 05:29:22,389
it's like ah it's annoying it's downshifting but every the car i've ever driven

1123
05:29:22,389 --> 05:29:30,150
didn't have that problem i didn't i didn't feel the car downshifting i do now why

1124
05:29:39,380 --> 05:29:51,500
where am i it's probably fine it means it has wasps in the car your gears are sloppy

1125
05:29:52,900 --> 05:30:01,819
huh slipping transmission what do i do about that is that a heart is it an easy fix is that

1126
05:30:01,819 --> 05:30:13,020
just like a hey man i'm i think my transmission is slipping fix it it's not what do you mean

1127
05:30:13,740 --> 05:30:29,540
how what do you mean it's expensive how expensive it's a couple hundred to a few thousand

1128
05:30:30,259 --> 05:30:39,290
that's a huge ballpark but am i getting some i'm getting some uh some slip it's slipping

1129
05:30:40,009 --> 05:30:54,380
that's not good i can feel it it only happens between like 20 mile between like 15 and 20 miles

1130
05:30:54,380 --> 05:31:06,119
per hour doesn't happen any other time is there a punch no of course why am i the only one that

1131
05:31:06,119 --> 05:31:25,400
falls first to second gear is fucked they can't go anywhere that apparently didn't get a hit all

1132
05:31:25,400 --> 05:31:32,779
right i'm in third place this is not bad i have an opportunity here to pass and get in first place

1133
05:31:32,779 --> 05:31:41,610
and win how did they not get hit by that stuff what kind of car do i drive but that would probably

1134
05:31:41,610 --> 05:31:49,209
help uh i drive a honda civic so maybe that would help oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

1135
05:31:49,209 --> 05:32:23,590
i just told people my car was my first place yeah it's a it's a 2023 honda civic i got the

1136
05:32:23,590 --> 05:32:28,200
new one early don't you guys know that they make these things fucking five years in advance to make

1137
05:32:28,200 --> 05:32:33,720
sure they have a shitload of them so they can just keep oh it's it's 2000 it's 2019 here's the 2021

1138
05:32:33,720 --> 05:32:48,150
they make there's like fucking a thousand of these cars already made guys new cars are like new

1139
05:32:48,150 --> 05:32:56,069
madden they just do a little bit of an update they change the paint and they make it look

1140
05:32:56,069 --> 05:33:10,549
shaped differently and then they smash the thing into walls a bunch of times and say hey we got

1141
05:33:10,549 --> 05:33:19,909
this safe yes it fucking better be don't you know i mean in every car commercial we've got

1142
05:33:19,909 --> 05:33:27,990
five star safety rating okay if you didn't i wouldn't have the car what do you mean the car

1143
05:33:27,990 --> 05:33:33,830
is working fucking safe good i it should be absolutely what do you mean why is it a selling

1144
05:33:33,830 --> 05:33:43,479
point two star safety and nobody ever talks about how their car is a two star safety car

1145
05:33:44,360 --> 05:33:51,500
they don't exist every car company likes to tell that well let me tell you a ranked five star safety

1146
05:33:51,580 --> 05:33:57,900
from yabba dabba doo associates okay well no one has a three or two star rated car

1147
05:34:07,380 --> 05:34:12,340
what does a two star rated car mean is it like yelp if you go to a two star restaurant you're

1148
05:34:12,340 --> 05:34:16,819
gonna get like sick so if you drive a two star car does that mean that it's gonna like break

1149
05:34:17,700 --> 05:34:34,040
i mean i can understand four stars five stars but but two i don't think there's any car

1150
05:34:35,000 --> 05:34:44,580
manufacturer that has a two star safety rating if they do the car is probably like

1151
05:34:45,540 --> 05:34:59,080
600 bucks how am i gonna win i'm in first place yeah get the fuck out of the way toad

always causing problems back here just lapped you going like two miles per hour oh it's 30 laps

1153
05:35:15,340 --> 05:35:27,720
oh shit why would anybody have a 30 lap race you're gonna run in a gas before the race is over

1154
05:35:27,720 --> 05:35:57,049
i made it 30 laps no i made it 30 long i didn't know what that meant all right what about a one

1155
05:35:57,049 --> 05:36:03,340
star rated car does that exist wait hold on let me answer that is a one star safety rated car

1156
05:36:04,139 --> 05:36:25,669

1158
05:36:35,669 --> 05:37:13,369

1159
05:37:13,369 --> 05:37:18,869
a real road though they definitely drove around somewhere because that's a real place that's real

1160
05:37:18,869 --> 05:38:14,250
grass real road now just 24 more of these finally i saw somebody else crash oh wait i died oh that

1161
05:38:14,569 --> 05:38:37,020
stupid that was terrible i want to no i want to turn it off 30 oh my god no i want to turn this

1162
05:38:37,020 --> 05:38:59,270
shit up yeah let's get let's get the fuck out of here well that was cycle mania pretty good

1163
05:38:59,270 --> 05:39:04,740
pretty fun ragequit no i saw i pretty much saw everything there is to see in the whole game

1164
05:39:11,479 --> 05:39:35,299
all right here's the plan oh my gosh here there are a few more but don't act like you have a plan

1165
05:39:35,299 --> 05:39:47,900
i do have a plan the plan is i'm going to i'm gonna leave it up to you guys okay we've been

1166
05:39:47,900 --> 05:39:58,500
doing a lot of fmv like the last three or four streams in a row have been fmv games so i'm

1167
05:39:58,500 --> 05:40:10,330
streaming tomorrow tomorrow is the last stream that will be a video game stream before the carnival

1168
05:40:10,330 --> 05:40:19,400
so i'm gonna ask you this very simple question with a poll do you want me to do more full motion

1169
05:40:19,400 --> 05:40:32,330
video stuff tomorrow or do something else i'm gonna make the poll right now that's something

1170
05:40:32,330 --> 05:40:45,290
else is just not fmv could be anything but there are one two three four there are about four

1171
05:40:45,930 --> 05:40:52,860
give or take fmv games left that are gonna take a long time to play kind of like the first one we

1172
05:40:52,860 --> 05:41:11,740
did i'm okay with holding on to these for another time but let's put this in here this is a simple

1173
05:41:11,740 --> 05:41:39,689
yes or no question there you go interesting okay can you tell us what the fmvs are um sure they are

1174
05:41:42,900 --> 05:41:51,610
uh flash traffic it's another one of those oh no there's a there's a plot that you need to stop

1175
05:41:51,610 --> 05:42:02,139
kind of like the first game but just not the same there's critical path the hell cab and

1176
05:42:02,139 --> 05:42:18,700
dracula you never did the second dragon's lair yo yeah i beat it i beat all the uh anime that

1177
05:42:18,700 --> 05:42:30,840
i i that hurt my whole head but yeah i did so it looks like uh most people would like to see

1178
05:42:30,840 --> 05:42:37,319
something else we can change it up it's been a lot of fmv we've done like 10 12 of these

1179
05:42:38,970 --> 05:42:44,139
it's it's a it's an overstimulating thing all right we'll do something else tomorrow

1180
05:42:48,740 --> 05:42:56,970
i will find something else to play tomorrow and then of course no whoops sorry and then of

1181
05:42:56,970 --> 05:43:01,290
course on the 16th is going to be the activity book stream that stream is not going to be very

1182
05:43:01,290 --> 05:43:05,130
long that stream is only going to be probably a couple hours long however long it takes to do

1183
05:43:05,130 --> 05:43:10,970
the book because then i have to get ready and that whole week is going to be setting up with

1184
05:43:11,770 --> 05:43:20,500
all the location people and the where we're going and get in touch with who's making the robots and

1185
05:43:20,500 --> 05:43:26,419
getting them and it's going to be a whole ordeal so i want to make sure that that's completely

1186
05:43:26,419 --> 05:43:40,549
taken care of and it's going to take me about a week robots question mark i am going to pin a

1187
05:43:40,549 --> 05:43:49,430
tweet tonight it's just going to be there for the next week and a half saying the date and the time

1188
05:43:49,430 --> 05:44:03,659
september 21st at 12 p.m eastern and i'm going to make a command here as well what is left for

1189
05:44:03,659 --> 05:44:13,750
tonight well i kind of i don't know if i want to start these right now because they might take

1190
05:44:13,750 --> 05:44:21,159
longer than a few hours and it's been about six hours now we've had these fmv streams have been

1191
05:44:21,159 --> 05:44:28,169
besides the one that got cut off they've been like a clean six hours so that's good and then

1192
05:44:28,169 --> 05:44:42,229
obviously the bits and everything so ends up being like six and a half seven so i like that

1193
05:44:42,229 --> 05:44:52,740
we'll hold on to them how many robots do you have for the carnival um those are spoilers am i going

1194
05:44:52,740 --> 05:45:00,790
to keep it under wraps i mean not there well let's just put this way that there's more than one

1195
05:45:00,790 --> 05:45:10,889
there are more than two you have there's more than two okay there you go all right told you

1196
05:45:10,889 --> 05:45:22,759
how many i did no whoops but you know what yeah i think we'll call it here this is a good place

1197
05:45:22,759 --> 05:45:28,860
to stop the other ones i'm certain i know for a fact that these other ones are going to take more

1198
05:45:28,860 --> 05:45:41,369
than a few hours so tomorrow we're gonna do something else and i i also want to be completely

1199
05:45:41,369 --> 05:45:51,159
honest here that fox hunt burnt like literally all of the fuel in my tank that was some of the

1200
05:45:51,159 --> 05:45:57,209
funniest fucked up shit i think i've ever seen it again so the first three and a half to four

1201
05:45:57,209 --> 05:46:05,380
hours of this stream was like all gas has been removed from the tank but it was awesome so yeah

1202
05:46:05,380 --> 05:46:10,180
i'll um i'll see you guys tomorrow we'll play a game we'll hang out probably we'll be probably

1203
05:46:10,180 --> 05:46:16,819
going to be a chill stream the next couple streams we're going to dial back the insanity

1204
05:46:16,819 --> 05:46:29,290
we'll just hang out and do something but uh with that see you tomorrow we'll do the bits

1205
05:46:30,009 --> 05:46:50,630
uh scrolling back here play monster rancher 2 monster rancher 2 memories but thank you door cube

1206
05:46:50,630 --> 05:46:59,610
for the 250 vhs streams are always fun you know what it's funny you say that because some of the

1207
05:46:59,610 --> 05:47:07,659
there are a lot of fmv games that are on vhs tapes somehow there are d i was gonna do a whole

1208
05:47:07,659 --> 05:47:15,689
thing playing dvd games from special features discs that is gonna take a whole ordeal getting

1209
05:47:15,689 --> 05:47:23,319
that set up you know when you buy like uh the lion king new animated blu-ray and there's just

1210
05:47:23,319 --> 05:47:35,619
a dumb fucking game on that disc i was gonna get a shitload of them that have it we were just gonna

1211
05:47:35,619 --> 05:47:41,700
play dvd games so like you can potentially look look forward to that in a later date

1212
05:47:44,680 --> 05:47:52,389
but not right now and not for a while there's a garfield dvd game well i'll have to get it

1213
05:47:53,110 --> 05:47:56,950
but thanks door keep for the 250 well germa with the activity book in carnival stream coming up

1214
05:47:57,669 --> 05:48:03,590
i think you know what the next big project is an fmv game of your own if you would make an fmv game

1215
05:48:03,590 --> 05:48:07,349
how to play would it be a point and click like fox hunt or more like security camera like night

1216
05:48:07,349 --> 05:48:12,409
trap it's funny you say that because that's something that i've like always wanted to do

1217
05:48:13,509 --> 05:48:20,819
i've brought up making an fmv game but i'm talking years ago more than a couple of years ago

1218
05:48:20,819 --> 05:48:30,150
the problem with game development and especially high budgeted development stuff

1219
05:48:31,189 --> 05:48:40,099
is that would need to be done the right way completely that would be a lot of money a lot

1220
05:48:40,099 --> 05:48:45,619
of potential people involved i would really need to get the right people involved in that

1221
05:48:46,259 --> 05:48:58,520
because it costs lots of money just to hire people and be on a location somewhere

1222
05:48:58,520 --> 05:49:02,599
even location scouting guys something that is a lot of people don't understand about

1223
05:49:03,319 --> 05:49:05,720
making a video or making streams or anything like that is

1224
05:49:06,919 --> 05:49:14,650
finding a place that will let you do things like a studio space or like where i was doing the

1225
05:49:14,650 --> 05:49:19,369
green screen stuff or the warehouse space or something and finding those places they're very

1226
05:49:19,369 --> 05:49:32,310
very very fucking expensive thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars so just

1227
05:49:32,310 --> 05:49:39,669
filming it just like principal photography for whatever it would be as i mean you're talking

1228
05:49:39,669 --> 05:49:45,430
about having to hire actors and people to make costumes and where are you going to film this

1229
05:49:45,430 --> 05:49:52,069
stuff do you have the permits to film this stuff before even pressing record on the camera you

1230
05:49:52,069 --> 05:50:01,880
might be looking at 50 60 70 hundred thousand dollars worth of stuff now some people we were

1231
05:50:01,880 --> 05:50:08,200
talking to like an fmv game right if you grab a camera with a couple of your buddies and you make

1232
05:50:08,200 --> 05:50:22,139
a movie then you get permission to film on location somewhere that's different hire random people from

1233
05:50:22,139 --> 05:50:30,040
craigslist you still have to hire those people but what would the gameplay be i always i wanted to

1234
05:50:30,040 --> 05:50:36,520
make a western i think that old school western like mad dog mccree is just the pinnacle of

1235
05:50:36,520 --> 05:50:40,919
full motion video games and i would want to make it authentic too i wouldn't i don't want hd cameras

1236
05:50:41,560 --> 05:50:45,319
at all if i was ever going to do something like that i want like 16 millimeter film

1237
05:50:46,119 --> 05:51:04,139
this shit doesn't have to be 1080p in fact i don't want it to be and have branching paths and stuff

1238
05:51:04,139 --> 05:51:08,060
i i've given this way too much thought for something that's not ever going to happen

1239
05:51:08,779 --> 05:51:15,220
at least in the near or far future but everybody does this everybody everybody sits down

1240
05:51:16,180 --> 05:51:21,610
and just thinks of you know what would be a great video game i think you just spitball

1241
05:51:26,919 --> 05:51:34,680
we can pull off miracles there was a lot of money given and i missed a big 50 dollar donation i'm

1242
05:51:34,680 --> 05:51:43,740
certain of that but cats beanie thanks for the 50 bucks 50 dollars from cats beanie and i this is

1243
05:51:43,740 --> 05:51:48,069
exactly what i was talking about not sure if you saw my big bits at the start of the stream it's

1244
05:51:48,069 --> 05:51:57,529
cool if not i was wondering what inspired you to do the robot carnival uh i don't know i just

1245
05:51:57,529 --> 05:52:04,919
thought it would be fun the original idea was i was going to get a dunk tank and have chat control

1246
05:52:04,919 --> 05:52:09,799
the pitching machine and then it was okay how you do that i just thought that would be fun i just

1247
05:52:09,799 --> 05:52:18,340
thought that that's it that was the only motivation or inspiration behind it because i was imagining

1248
05:52:19,139 --> 05:52:25,080
everybody in the chat like fighting over the controls and me just talking shit sitting up

1249
05:52:25,080 --> 05:52:29,799
there and everyone like missing and you try and then trying to we're gonna dunk them you know we

1250
05:52:29,799 --> 05:52:33,240
gotta dunk this motherfucker and i'm just sitting there like with a cigar like you ain't gonna

1251
05:52:33,240 --> 05:52:45,909
fucking dunk me and then it evolved into a bunch of games and a bunch of stuff so i don't i don't

1252
05:52:45,909 --> 05:52:54,419
inspiration and motivation stuff for me really just stems from i i don't know it just i just if

1253
05:52:54,419 --> 05:52:57,619
i think something's funny or interesting and i think it's worth pursuing and i'll do it

1254
05:52:58,259 --> 05:53:11,020
is really it we're gonna dunk you good luck go for it i wish you all the luck in the world

1255
05:53:11,659 --> 05:53:17,540
because you're gonna be fighting with the person sitting next to you because they're gonna want to

1256
05:53:17,540 --> 05:53:21,779
go left they're gonna want to increase the speed they're somebody over there is gonna want to

1257
05:53:21,779 --> 05:53:29,720
reduce the speed good luck oh that person just like decided to turn it that way i have faith

1258
05:53:38,220 --> 05:53:47,819
you still gotta smoke a cigar we're gonna get you in 10 seconds i would be shocked

1259
05:53:48,619 --> 05:53:56,729
if you dunked me in 10 seconds there is almost no way that's possible unless that every single

1260
05:53:56,729 --> 05:54:31,740
person works together no fucking way let's practice okay let's practice you're spoiling

1261
05:54:31,740 --> 05:54:36,200
commands i don't even i don't know if these are the commands now we have to go over that

1262
05:54:38,490 --> 05:54:45,849
increase speed 5000 yeah twitch could beat pokemon i'll get dunked oh maybe i won't

1263
05:54:46,409 --> 05:54:55,369
well i'm not gonna make it easy for you just thinking face on that one guys you know get

1264
05:54:55,369 --> 05:55:00,090

1271
05:56:09,669 --> 05:56:16,340
time i'm streaming i gotta stream i don't like i said i think i said this yesterday i don't want

1272
05:56:16,340 --> 05:56:23,220
a scenario where i stream one time in two weeks if i can help it i'd like to keep broadcasting

1273
05:56:24,020 --> 05:56:34,090
because then twitchcon is that next weekend a lot of shit going on but maybe i don't know

1274
05:56:34,090 --> 05:56:43,299
we'll see but thank you thank you demons v for the 250 do you find streaming to be fulfilling

1275
05:56:43,299 --> 05:56:47,779
besides the obvious financial benefit do you feel like you have a creative outlet in your work

1276
05:56:47,779 --> 05:56:54,630
stimulating yeah i mean that's the whole point of doing something like the carnival

1277
05:56:56,119 --> 05:57:05,979
is to make sure that i continue to stimulate myself i get bored really really easily and

1278
05:57:05,979 --> 05:57:14,229
when i get bored i start to not care about something so that hasn't happened yet on stream for

1279
05:57:14,229 --> 05:57:20,700
streaming i don't want to have it get there because once it becomes boring it gonna parrot

1280
05:57:20,700 --> 05:57:26,330
what i said yesterday once it becomes not interesting and boring to me is when i would

1281
05:57:26,330 --> 05:57:40,790
just hang my hat up and be like that was fun i don't see that happening anytime soon but when

1282
05:57:40,790 --> 05:57:46,310
it does and if it does then you know you have to start to you know you close the book and you open

1283
05:57:46,310 --> 05:58:04,970
up a new one so this is a good final stream this one right here i don't know i cannot predict the

1284
05:58:04,970 --> 05:58:15,419
future i don't have a crystal ball but streaming at the moment is completely fulfilling and it

1285
05:58:15,419 --> 05:58:28,310
continues to be and we'll see how it goes from here i think it'll be good that's just me being

1300
06:00:59,590 --> 06:01:03,110

1301
06:01:03,110 --> 06:01:11,830
how i imagine you would if you were a secret agent it's great have a good night that game was

1302
06:01:11,830 --> 06:01:17,270
just ridiculous that's the kind of i would want to make something that was just not supposed to be

1303
06:01:17,270 --> 06:01:23,900
taken seriously but was interesting enough that the game had interesting things to do

1304
06:01:27,770 --> 06:01:40,040
i don't want to make just like a straight up strict meme game where it where it just has

1305
06:01:41,099 --> 06:01:49,020
only like crazy funny things whoa crazy what oh he he shit his pants and you pooped his pants

1306
06:01:49,020 --> 06:01:55,349
no i don't want to do that it would be i would try to have some comedy aspects to it but i think

1307
06:01:55,349 --> 06:02:02,819
i would want to have it be an actual game but thank you for the 250 yeah i did like it i thought it

1308
06:02:02,819 --> 06:02:14,729
was really interesting hey wolfstar thanks for the four dollars this is the longest time i've

1309
06:02:14,729 --> 06:02:25,450
ever spent watching a stream um the longest time i ever was on a stream was simpsons hit and run

1310
06:02:28,180 --> 06:02:39,049
13 hours right but thanks for watching for that long it yeah that's thanks i hope you enjoyed it

thank you egg johnson for the 250 hey germa when are you going to give the people what they want

1312
06:02:46,580 --> 06:02:52,119
and do a chess stream i know how to play chess but i don't know how to play chess

1313
06:02:52,919 --> 06:03:11,060
i would never do that phylactery with the 69 subs let's show the subs thank you everybody

1314
06:03:11,619 --> 06:03:17,450
for gifting subs for subbing for resubbing for if you're brand new and you just subbed

1315
06:03:17,450 --> 06:03:22,950
if you've been here for years and you decided to sub if you don't sub at all that's fine too

1316
06:03:23,509 --> 06:03:32,310
thanks for being here you guys think i can handle chess after the checkers incidents

1317
06:03:42,580 --> 06:03:46,340
thank you bro luck for the five dollars i think this stream has proven you don't know much about

1318
06:03:46,340 --> 06:03:51,380
cars it's not one rpm it's a thousand rpm i know i'm just saying on the dash

1319
06:03:52,500 --> 06:03:58,020
rpm is revolutions per minute revolutions of the crankshaft every minute also most cars before

1320
06:03:58,020 --> 06:04:04,580
like 2005 have basic basically zero star rating because of all the new safety features in newer

1321
06:04:04,580 --> 06:04:09,459
cars like crumble zones better airbags crash avoidance systems and overall better engineering

1322
06:04:09,459 --> 06:04:24,650
get your transmission looked at but are there any one-star cars now is a lawnmower a like zero

1323
06:04:24,650 --> 06:04:39,580
safety rated car right is a one star safety rated vehicle of rideable lawnmower it's not a car

1324
06:04:39,580 --> 06:04:48,439
it's an automobile it's a traveling vehicle with an engine it's not road legal

1325
06:04:55,750 --> 06:05:01,669
it's not road legal imagine seeing some fucking dickhead on like the road with a

1326
06:05:01,669 --> 06:05:10,009
rideable mower this is out of red light you look at the window you're like hey man what the fuck

1327
06:05:10,009 --> 06:05:16,009
is wrong with you now don't worry about it the blades aren't down i'm not the blades aren't

1328
06:05:16,009 --> 06:05:30,740
active those things can fucking move but the blade's not done i've worked in the country

1329
06:05:30,740 --> 06:05:46,459
people did that that's so fucking dangerous all right hold on what about a forklift is a forklift

1330
06:05:46,540 --> 06:05:58,700
a five star safety rated vehicle it's its only existence is for safety it has to be a forklift

1331
06:05:58,700 --> 06:06:03,500
is a safety vehicle therefore it has to be a five star rated safety vehicle otherwise would you get

1332
06:06:03,500 --> 06:06:13,270
in one forklifts don't have doors or airbag but uh what if they did what do you mean a forklift

1333
06:06:13,270 --> 06:06:25,689
doesn't have an airbag imagine being in a forklift and just like bumping into the wall and a big air

1334
06:06:25,689 --> 06:06:38,729
bag hits you in the face the airbag would fucking like knock you out you're going like eight miles

1335
06:06:38,729 --> 06:06:56,360
per hour like you just face first in the airbag here's a zero star rated car from 2014 wait

1336
06:06:57,159 --> 06:07:10,099
what is this actually real crash test of the the ford fego what is a ford fego

1337
06:07:11,299 --> 06:07:30,220
ford what ford fego safety rating the ford fego facelift has received a three star safety rating

1338
06:07:33,779 --> 06:07:46,250
in the new one what about the 2014 one i ain't gonna eat at that restaurant are you guys like me

1342
06:08:23,610 --> 06:08:31,400
i ain't gonna go nobody reviews mcdonald's if you leave a two star rating at a restaurant that's

1343
06:08:31,400 --> 06:08:38,680
not one of those fast food places there was a reason why i can't remember the last time that

1344
06:08:38,680 --> 06:08:43,799
somebody forgot half my fucking order at mcdonald's and i was like let me just go on your fucking

1345
06:08:43,799 --> 06:08:51,110
heel pretty give them one star i know you go oh mcdonald's like sucks whatever and you like

1346

1347
06:08:59,750 --> 06:09:07,349
king uh my whopper it tastes like somebody and it looks like somebody sat on it it's missing all

1348
06:09:07,349 --> 06:09:16,060
the things i asked for it and then the bun is it looks like it has mold on it get on me open

1349
06:09:16,060 --> 06:09:20,709
no you just let go of that i'm throwing this in the trash this thing's gross and you move on

1350
06:09:27,770 --> 06:09:31,049
and also some people that here's another thing this is where this is where it gets like kind of

1351
06:09:31,049 --> 06:09:36,970
weird some people will review restaurants and and they give it a bad rating when maybe they

1352
06:09:36,970 --> 06:09:43,080
even shouldn't have you know sometimes it's just somebody's like i and you know the way i'll tell

1353
06:09:43,080 --> 06:09:51,959
you i was gonna i was gonna give this place four stars because the food was great end quote but

1354
06:09:51,959 --> 06:09:58,520
let me tell you something about the server katherine okay she came over to my table

1355
06:09:59,860 --> 06:10:09,110
and she didn't ask me if i wanted a water refill places a one star restaurant there was this the

1356
06:10:09,110 --> 06:10:15,110
sugar wasn't repacked on the table i mean my my burrito was absolutely delicious it was probably

1357
06:10:15,110 --> 06:10:19,979
one of the best burritos in the city but what if i wanted fucking coffee and i wanted to put sugar

1358
06:10:19,979 --> 06:10:33,560
in my coffee it wasn't on the table jeez what the fuck why is this person putting sugar in their

1359
06:10:33,560 --> 06:10:46,299
burrito you know i sat down at this table and i am not kidding i saw a smudge a big smudge on the

1360
06:10:46,299 --> 06:11:10,099
table somebody's thumbprint and it made me gag and me and my nine children left sometimes people

1361
06:11:10,099 --> 06:11:16,360
do big orders and i i gotta you gotta give some credit to the restaurants right sometimes

1362
06:11:17,240 --> 06:11:23,700
if you go in with like 10 people and you let's say you all order the exact same thing let's say you

1363
06:11:23,700 --> 06:11:31,979
all there's 10 of you you go into the restaurant you all order the chicken thighs you're all going

1364
06:11:31,979 --> 06:11:35,900
to get a slightly different food slightly just only slightly because like no two chickens are

1365
06:11:35,900 --> 06:11:40,200
the same one of them might have a little bit of fat on it one of them but they're still good you

1366
06:11:40,200 --> 06:11:48,040
know it might still be good you can't everyone can't have the exact same food no matter what

1367
06:11:48,040 --> 06:11:54,619
the chicken is a different it's a different chicken possibly what if that chicken was lazy

1368
06:11:54,619 --> 06:12:00,779
and didn't run around what if that chicken was a little tougher than the other one it's just basic

1369
06:12:00,779 --> 06:12:09,340
science guys it's just basic food science and then i take a bite out of my food and the same exact

1370
06:12:09,340 --> 06:12:12,779
order on the menu it's got the same sauce same everything it's a little tougher oh this is kind

1371
06:12:12,779 --> 06:12:17,740
of tough today and the person next to me is like this is fucking absolutely scrumptious let me try

1372
06:12:17,740 --> 06:12:25,529
yours yeah that is like good i think i give it a one star rating because like the chicken didn't

1373
06:12:25,529 --> 06:12:44,360
fucking run around in the coop it's just basic science people that leave yelp reviews on

1374
06:12:44,360 --> 06:12:51,130
mcdonald's you know i was thinking about i don't know just a random thought just go to like

1375
06:12:51,130 --> 06:12:57,000
mcdonald's just go and like go and uh that was a good that was it was just a regular decent

1376
06:12:57,000 --> 06:13:02,759
mcdonald's experience and write like an absolutely wonderful review like five stars like as if this

1377
06:13:02,759 --> 06:13:11,930
place is like 200 dollars a plate talk about the inside i walked in and oh i was wowed by the

1378
06:13:11,930 --> 06:13:23,900
architecture the beautiful the crimson red and the mustard yellow it was just the color combination

1379
06:13:23,900 --> 06:13:29,259
just matched so perfectly well and the chairs were very sturdy and do like a full five paragraph

1380
06:13:30,060 --> 06:13:41,700
about how amazing the place was the stunning design choice of the ketchup on the table yeah

1381
06:13:41,700 --> 06:13:58,939
just go fucking nuts how do we end up in this topic i don't know i have no i have no idea oh

1382
06:13:58,939 --> 06:14:06,630
talk about cars right like two stars for car yeah okay that's all don't say it was a mcdonald's

1383
06:14:06,630 --> 06:14:19,380
until the end of the review well it would have to be like on a mcdonald's page ah you know what

1384
06:14:19,380 --> 06:14:22,979
this is gonna be it might be i don't know it's possible that this might be an unpopular opinion

1385
06:14:23,860 --> 06:14:30,900
i don't think that there should be stars on yelp i think it should just be have to ride fucking

1386
06:14:30,900 --> 06:14:43,830
review that's just me i just like sip this there's nothing in it i did like the kermit the frog thing

1389
06:15:04,409 --> 06:15:08,569
hey christin thanks for 30 bucks what about team fortress 2 what about team fortress 2

1390
06:15:08,569 --> 06:15:14,650
it's a great first person shooter with an awesome array of classes and lots of gameplay choices

1391
06:15:15,529 --> 06:15:19,319
one of the best first person shooters i may have ever played it's a great game

1392
06:15:19,319 --> 06:15:33,319
what about it it's good you should play it i i honestly you know i i may have drained i may

1393
06:15:33,319 --> 06:15:40,360
have like drained all the vampire type blood out of that game that i can you know i i've like sunk

1394
06:15:40,360 --> 06:15:50,069
my teeth into tf2 and i drained all the blood it's all gone for me step on it come on that

1395
06:15:50,069 --> 06:16:04,099
wasn't even very good df2 yelp no i have no intention of playing it again really it would

1396
06:16:04,099 --> 06:16:09,459
take something very very very significant for me to ever play that game again i still think it's

1397
06:16:09,459 --> 06:16:17,380
one of the best games ever made but you know i also think pizza is the best like food in the

1398
06:16:17,459 --> 06:16:23,220
world i like love pizza i love pepperoni pizza more than anything but i sometimes sometimes

1399
06:16:23,220 --> 06:16:26,740
you just don't want to eat pepperoni pizza you want to move on to like sushi or something and

1400
06:16:26,740 --> 06:16:39,799
it becomes your new favorite thing you can't eat pizza every day don't even give me that bagel bites

1401
06:16:39,799 --> 06:16:44,119
bullshit commercial about pizza in the morning pizza in the evening pizza at suppertime

1402
06:16:45,060 --> 06:16:57,540
pizzas on a bagel it could be pizza every time no don't do that pizza should not be eaten in the

1403
06:16:57,540 --> 06:17:10,580
morning in the afternoon and at the evening every day but thank you for the $30 30,000 bits

1404
06:17:11,220 --> 06:17:16,180
i have no intention of going back to team fortress i do love that game and i do like seeing it pop

1405
06:17:16,180 --> 06:17:20,099
up when it pops up from time to time you'll see it somewhere usually it'll there'll be like an

1406
06:17:20,099 --> 06:17:24,580
image or there'll be some artwork or there'll be um something like meme that uses the characters

1407
06:17:24,580 --> 06:17:34,330
you're like oh there they are it's a nice little reminder uh modus pons thanks for the 250 there's

1408
06:17:34,330 --> 06:17:40,729
a repair pal there's a possible oh this is for the car possible shift control solenoid fault

1409
06:17:41,529 --> 06:17:51,770
i'm gonna i'm gonna bookmark that thanks for the help that actually like maybe you just figured it

1410
06:17:51,770 --> 06:18:03,689
up pizza is more nutritious than cereal what cereal are you eating because i would have to

1411
06:18:03,689 --> 06:18:10,150
tell you that like like Kellogg's corn flakes i'm not sure is less healthy than a slice of

1412
06:18:10,229 --> 06:18:25,099
pepperoni pizza but what about total how do people put sugar on their cereal i don't like can we go

1413
06:18:25,099 --> 06:18:36,860
over that too why do people do that i've seen people have a bowl of cereal and they go in the

1414
06:18:36,860 --> 06:18:42,939
little sugar bowl and just one two three four and you spread it on the top and you move it around

1415
06:18:43,819 --> 06:18:54,630
what would you don't do that depends on the cereal no it's not supposed you're not supposed to put

1416
06:18:54,630 --> 06:19:01,189
a bunch of sugar on your total brand flakes that's you breaking the design philosophy

1417
06:19:01,189 --> 06:19:07,380
of the developer the dev didn't want you to go through that door and you broke it and you went

1418
06:19:07,380 --> 06:19:12,500
in anyways and you glitched through the wall and you saw all the items that are in the fucking game

1419
06:19:12,500 --> 06:19:25,560
in the dev room breaking and now you you got it you fucked it all up and you soil it for yourself

1420
06:19:25,560 --> 06:19:37,099
i don't even put sugar in my coffee anymore did you guys know that you're only supposed to have

1421
06:19:37,659 --> 06:19:43,099
35 or 38 grams of added sugar a day did you guys know that did you guys know this

1422
06:19:48,520 --> 06:19:56,919
if you drink one soda if you drink one coca-cola classic out of the can your entire day of added

1423
06:19:56,919 --> 06:20:07,639
sugar is over and then you are now over what the heck is going on here they're sweetening us to

1424
06:20:07,639 --> 06:20:28,869
death this is what they're doing i have this this powder it's like a little uh it's like a

1425
06:20:28,869 --> 06:20:34,840
flavored like vanilla powder right you can put it in your coffee you can add it to

1426
06:20:34,840 --> 06:20:41,669
pretty much whatever you want on the back of this thing it's oh here here's the the serving size

1427
06:20:43,130 --> 06:20:52,119
a third of a cup of this sugar powder is one serving a third of a cup of this

1428
06:20:53,080 --> 06:21:05,139
dusty vanilla sugar fucking bullshit is one serving shit's almost 40 grams of sugar why

1429
06:21:05,139 --> 06:21:12,250
why would you put that much in there are you okay calm i can't calm down we're talking about the

1430
06:21:12,330 --> 06:21:22,310
health of of talking about our health i'm talking about your health did you know

1431
06:21:25,860 --> 06:21:32,819
did you know that if you cut the amount of sugar in half that you put into your coffee

1432
06:21:33,779 --> 06:21:52,819
you wouldn't know the difference in a blind taste test did you know how can you cut zero and half

1433
06:21:53,700 --> 06:22:00,490

1487
06:33:02,330 --> 06:33:09,750
just by how many viruses they have on their computer like all i need is a uh all i need is

1488
06:33:09,750 --> 06:33:15,189
a name oh hey all i need is a okay just look at what the last like the last five websites were

1489
06:33:15,189 --> 06:33:23,500
in their history you can do one of those like cold reading like okay so um well what what was her

1490
06:33:23,500 --> 06:33:30,310
name oh okay what and how old was she you could really do that just scan the computer for viruses

1491
06:33:30,310 --> 06:33:35,740
if there's more than 500 viruses that person is over the age of 65 years old i'm getting the fact
