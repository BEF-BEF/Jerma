1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:10,019
Hey, what's going on? Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I was like ready to start like 25

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,380
minutes ago, but I couldn't find my fucking brace. And after last night, I was like, I have to have,

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:22,100
I gotta find it. So I was going through all the laundry trying to find where it was. Did I wash

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:33,130
it? Where is it? And I, uh, I got it. I found it. Thank God. I was here like 40 minutes ago.

5
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,579
When you lose something in your house, you just can never find it. It's the worst. I hate losing

6
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:46,539
stuff. Everybody does though. Anyways, uh, today, I hope you're having a good day today. We're going

7
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:53,340
to be playing Mega Man Legends finally. Not pushing it back anymore. It's happening today.

8
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,740
Not going to say, yeah, then we'll do Mega Man Legends tomorrow. That doesn't happen.

9
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:08,700
Next week. And it doesn't happen. It's been delayed like five times. So here it is.

10
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:26,939
He's actually playing it. I can't fucking Pog. Pog. Black and White 2 is, no, I'm not going to

11
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,459
enable Pog. I'd like to read it. It makes, it has more meaning for me if I read it out loud.

12
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:43,780
There's already PogChamp. Pog is, it needs to be, I want to read it. Uh, but what did somebody just

13
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:54,620
ask? Somebody ask something? Paperclip game? Oh, we, I beat that whole thing yesterday. Black and

14
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,540
White 2. There it is. Okay. Right. So Black and White 2, uh, I had technical issues with it,

15
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:14,819
but now I, it, it should be good to go after a few more tweaks. So that is on the table

16
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:24,439
after this stream. So Mega Man Legends tonight, I think I can do this in one stream, right?

17
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,680
Because Mega Man Legends is only like, like a six, seven hour long game, isn't it?

18
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:41,669
No, it's not. How long is it? Okay. According to howlongtobeat.com, it's a seven hour game,

19
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:50,150
but you have to add on the three or four hours of ADHD. So we're looking at probably like

20
00:02:50,150 --> 00:03:00,539
eight to 12 hours, seven hours. Well, we'll see. We'll see how far we get. I could do it another

21
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,960
time. The goal is to try to get it done today. I'm not going to be live over the next couple

22
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,520
days. I have physical therapy, so we'll do, we'll try to get another long one tonight. I've got my

23
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,969
boomer brace on. I'm good to go. The Sonic movie was good. That's what I heard that week, but that's

24
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:27,030
what I said the other day, yesterday. Prove that you have your boomer brace on. Okay. Hold on.

25
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:35,460
Remember these guys? Nah, what if I just was lying? No, no, I don't need to put it. Nah,

26
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,539
my camera's not working. I can't, like, it doesn't work. My fucking, the plug doesn't work.

27
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:51,289
Hold on here. You want proof? I've got my, I've got my backpack on. So you can't see down here,

28
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:57,349
but what this does. Villain. Yeah, I know. What this does is that it's not just this.

29
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:05,129
It's here too. You're like, it goes all, I don't want to, I'm not going to like stand up on my

30
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,569
chair, but it goes all the way down and wraps around my bottom of my ribs and like pulls them

31
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:22,300
together. And it feels pretty good actually. Wesker? I could probably pull off a Wesker if

32
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:31,910
I had the glasses. Do you think so? All right. I'm ready to play. If I had the glasses and,

33
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:42,899
what's the buzz? I hear a buzz. What's the buzz? Hold on. If you guys hear a buzz,

34
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:58,180
you will. Why is it buzzing? What the fuck is going on? Hold on. What the fuck? Why is there a buzz?

35
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:05,050
It's getting louder. Why is it like somebody turned on the microwave

36
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:25,430
next to my PlayStation? Oh, hold on. Give me a second. Let me fix this. Is it gone? It's gone.

37
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:45,959
All right. Hold on. I got to like, somebody move. Is it gone? It's there a little. It's all right.

38
00:05:45,959 --> 00:06:00,180
It's fine. Okay. It's there a little, but why is this happening right now? The cable is fucked up.

39
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:09,930
All right. All right. Here we go. We get big bits. Where? It's not as loud. It's not as loud

40
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,529
as it was before. It's something to do with this cable, I think. Cable's fucked up. I don't know

41
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:17,860
what I did to it. Maybe it has something to do with turning the console upside down to play

42
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,740
Jeremy Lammy and like breaking it. All right. Everything's fine. Everything's going to be fine.

43
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,110
All right. Welcome to the stream. Let's start a new game. Mega Man Legends. I had a big bit.

44
00:06:32,230 --> 00:07:00,009
I like the voice acting already. So where does this sit in the timeline for Mega Man?

45
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,509
He's like 20. How old is he?

46
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,709
Be careful.

47
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:34,949
You got the crystal? We had big bits. I'll go over in a second. Hold on.

48
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:56,790
I remember this game being fucking awesome. Am I wrong? Am I right here? Is this a running

49
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,949
sequence? It looks pretty good still. It's it's whole it's hell. This is PlayStation 1.

50
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:19,079
This is PS1, guys. This is not emulation. This is not. This is all original hardware. Well,

51
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,920
PlayStation 2. But still it looks pretty good for PS1. Oh shit. All right. Hold on. So that's

52
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,100
oh wow. It's it's full 3D. One of the first ever full 3D games.

53
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:49,350
Okay. Reaverbot. Reaverbot. Okay. You square to fire. Press the R2 button to automatically

54
00:08:49,350 --> 00:09:02,250
lock onto the nearest target. All right. Yeah. These things. Oh, there it is.

55
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:15,720
Oh shit. That's awesome. All right. Let's go. All right. I already love it. I already love it.

56
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:28,299
This is janky. No, it's not. This is mega. Hey, this is the fucking this is the most legendary

57
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:40,779
Mega Man game that's ever been released. I do. It's right here. It's right in front of me.

58
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,750
Dude, I can't wait just to do the fucking stock market midi game that's in this one, too.

59
00:09:51,100 --> 00:10:08,570
That's it. Yeah. Always open stuff. Oh shit. Is there a zoom out the camera button?

60
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:22,899
I can't watch like it upgrades. I don't know. No, I don't like this. This is not. This is I want

61
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:34,019
to pull the camera out a little bit. No, I don't like it. Increase FOV. No, actually, it's pretty

62
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:46,980
good. One thing I wish I could do is make. All right, I can jump, right? A, B, X. Use X jump.

63
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,539
If you can't make it in one jump, you can sometimes grab onto the edge and pull yourself up.

64
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:07,100
Cool. There is a jump here. I want to make, uh, can I free look law map now? Wait, directional

65
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:14,230
button turn. So wait a minute. So I can do what the hell does that mean? Because I want to make

66
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,990
it so I wish I could do my right stick, but the right stick didn't exist for PlayStation one,

67
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:26,340
right? The voices are quiet. I mean, I don't think there's anything I can do about that.

68
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,179
Did it? No, it didn't. It did. It had the left stick, right? No. What? Did it have two sticks?

69
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:41,740
Did a PlayStation one originally? No, it didn't have any. Oh, that's way better. Yeah. I don't

70
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:50,950
want L1, R1 to turn. That's so much better. Yeah, that's a thousand times better. I can actually

71
00:11:50,950 --> 00:12:12,919
turn. It's kind of like tank controls when you do this, but it's all right. It's much better than

72
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:24,700
it was before. What is that? Oh, it's alive. Wait, should I jump on it? Okay. Can I not grab this

73
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:35,860
ledge? Oh, it's a ton of money. Oh, nice. Explanation. Quantum refractors are large

74
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,500
crystals that provide energy for machines. They can also be used as currency. Not a big deal.

75
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,740
If you're finally lucky, if you're really lucky, you might find an orange energy cube.

76
00:12:47,639 --> 00:13:02,059
Grab it to recharge your life gauge. Oh my God, it disappeared. What? Oh, that was so much money

77
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:21,799
that I don't have now. Holy shit. I was too slow. How could I have been? What was that?

78
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:32,169
Oh, it's an energy field. Wait, Mega Man. Wait. Okay. Fuck you game. I thought Mega Man was two

79
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:37,399
words. Do I have to change everything? Do I have to change my title? Use R2 to track enemies above

80
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:45,659
and below you that are out of your field of sight. Oh look, you're up there, aren't you?

81
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:57,860
Oh shit. Maybe I actually want to keep it on L1, R1. I feel like it's a part of the... Yeah,

82
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:14,970
maybe I do. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll get used to it. I'll get used to it.

83
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:24,500
Because then I can actually keep enemies in frame. Yeah, I'll get used to it. L1, R1. Say the line.

84
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,539
That wasn't even a giant. That was not even a... No. I don't say the line for things that aren't

85
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:41,129
even the line. Come on, get it. Just like the original Mega Man. You jump and jump, jump,

86
00:14:41,929 --> 00:15:06,970
jump and shoot, jump and shoot. Yeah. Oh, you found 560 zenny. Hold on. There's a Kingdom Hearts

87
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:14,570
currency? You got Power Razor. You said 10... We had... Hold on. Wait. We had $50 come in too.

88
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,580
We had 10 community subs from Wosse. 10 community subs from Vertible Giant.

89
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,149
Thanks, both of you. And then we had 5,000 bits from Bitslave. They say, hey, German, thanks to

90
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:33,190
you. I got Johnny Walker. Check out the review. What Johnny Walker... Wait, what Johnny Walker

91
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:43,590
did you get? That's important. Got Black Label. It's all right. I said that's pretty good. I mean,

92
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:58,500
I'm a Johnny Walker blue guy myself, but... Let's see what you think. Don't smell it. Just drink it.

93
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,740
Look at Mr. Fancy Pants. You buy a blue label and you drink it over the course of like five years.

94
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:09,259
I'm going to defend that in just a second here. Hold on. What do you think?

95
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:32,309
Pretty good. Pretty good. Pretty good. I think he liked it. 895? What? 895.

96
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:48,100
German 895. Oh, that's fucking funny. Liquid. All right. I quote, first of all,

97
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:55,450
thanks for the 5,000 bits. Glad you like it. Also, Plane Dad says hi. Tell Plane Dad I said hello.

98
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,779
Thank you. Oh, I'm glad you liked it. It's good shit. Explanation. Hold on. We'll talk about this

99
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,420
in a second. Power Razor is a Mega Man Buster part. Attaching Buster parts allows you to power up

100
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,819
your Buster gun. You can attach Buster parts by pressing the start button to go to the menu

101
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:30,740
and select equip from the Buster. Buster parts. Why is there nothing here? Oh, attack plus one

102
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:42,140
attack. Sick. Oh, I love it already. I love it already. It's already equipped. Let's go.

103
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:53,000
Look at it. It's a little bigger too. Nice. I haven't even found that if I didn't go down

104
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,089
the right hallway. All right. Anything else? No. How do I get a big view of the map?

105
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:06,650
Select. And they thought, look at how far. Look at fucking Capcom. You know what I mean?

106
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:18,380
Is there a door over here that I could've gone in? No. Just didn't explore it. Oh, Capcom does it

107
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:26,779
again. There's a blue door over here. Oh, no. I got it right in the plasma.

108
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:39,240
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

109
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,539
That's not a bad Mega Man. That's not a bad Mega Man at all.

110
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:26,569
Boss battle. How do I do the dodge? There's no dodge roll. Yeah, there is. I did it a few times

111
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:50,279
already. Shit, I'm just going nuts. Do I have to be locked on first? I'm gonna need it. Yeah,

112
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:56,140
you can lock on. You don't have to lock on though. It goes in the direction that you're aiming

113
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:17,700
whatever enemy is there. Buy no helmet. He's protecting everything on his whole body except

114
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:35,960
for his head. The most important part. You can get one later? All right, cool. All right. Anyways,

115
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,960
if you buy an expensive bottle of alcohol like whiskey or like an expensive tequila or something,

116
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,599
you're not supposed to drink it all in one, two, three days.

117
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,089
You don't buy like a $300 bottle of whiskey and drink it in one day.

118
00:20:52,730 --> 00:21:11,619
No, you drink. That's a special occasion alcohol. Again? Okay, if you buy a bottle of

119
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:20,180
um, Jack Daniels, what like, who cares?

120
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:48,099
Sponsored content. There's actually people that think that Johnny Walker Blue is disgusting and

121
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:55,940
that I'm disgusting for liking it because it's a blend. You are gross. You should be drinking

122
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:18,519
right out of the barrel from one source. What's going on? I thought the game froze. Why does

123
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:44,920
this ship look like it's flying upside down? It is. Oh, we're not at work anymore. You can

124
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:53,559
call me. You can call me Dave. We should be able to get by with that for a while.

125
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:59,269
We're as easy to find as this. Don't worry. We'll find it someday.

126
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,869
And your parents too. Thanks. I know we will.

127
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:24,490
Who is this guy? I can tell he's going to be shady because he's got one of these

128
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,809
voices that they have in every single cartoon. He's going to be a little weird.

129
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:21,140
Mega Man, go help the guy. That's why you wear a fucking helmet.

130
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,619
Both of you. Hope this is a lesson for all three of you actually.

131
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:54,630
I can't wait for the upgrades. I'm so excited to upgrade. Who cares about the game? I just

132
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,789
care about the numbers going up.

133
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:06,299
soon. We'll be here for a while, I guess. This island. What do you call it, Mega Man?

134
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:30,789
Catalocks. I think you could go take a look around. Sure. There's a kick. Who's this?

135
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:37,559
Hi, my name's Data. But you already knew that, didn't you? I mean, we've been friends for years,

136
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:43,609
right? Right. Yeah, of course I do that. Come talk to me if you want to. Oh, save. All right.

137
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:58,630
What do you want to do? Recharge energy. Save the game. Remember card one. Yes, I want to save.

138
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:02,970
Do auto voice. You got it. For this character, I will. I promise.

139
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:15,940
Tell me. Tell me. What can I help? What can I help you with? Uh, no, I don't need. This is like

140
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:24,599
tutorial info. Okay, so, uh, I got a map here. This is a big place. Let's go to the, let's go

141
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:33,900
to the market. Let's just go this way. To town. That's a pretty good Minecraft sign.

142
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:59,720
What's going on? The police are here. Um, can I? Police? Oh, there they are. What's the matter?

143
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,819
Well, you certainly put on quite a show. And it looks like everyone's all right.

144
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:25,450
Glad to see you're all right after the crash. Okay, bye. Secret. Always check for secrets so

145
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:33,799
I can kick trees or something. Do a Trump voice instead. You know, I love how the court of, of,

146
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:41,079
of chat's opinion on the Trump voice has increased. Remember when I first did the Trump voice and

147
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:46,700
everyone was like, Oh, it's don't, no, no, no. Stephen Colbert does a better job. Did it like

148
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:58,150
five or six more times. And now it gets, it gets requested. I want to go down inside the ruins

149
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:06,140
to look for some part. Am I too loud? Why do I feel like I'm loud right now? Am I, am I loud?

150
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:17,480
No, I'm good. Okay. Fine. Okay. Look for some parts and other stuff. I'm afraid of reaver bots and

151
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,480
whatever else might be down there. But if I don't find something to sell in my shop,

152
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:32,460
I'll be in trouble. Go in it. And why just looking inside? What do you have to say?

153
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:44,140
Is this your ship? It shouldn't be here. This is a no parking zone. It ain't mine. This gate's

154
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:55,369
malfunctioning. We can't get it to lock. We'd better fix it soon. Were you in the flying machine

155
00:28:55,369 --> 00:29:00,089
that just crash landed? If so, could you wait until you've spoken with the inspector before

156
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:05,369
entering the city? I believe the inspector's gone to investigate the crash site. Didn't I already,

157
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:12,650
I don't, I tried. He didn't say anything. What? Oh, here's the little Lego guys.

158
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:56,730
Hold on. Why is it so much reverb? That one's loud. Those are tuber voices.

159
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:03,619
Come on. If I have, if I have access to it, do you think I'm not going to use it? It sometimes,

160
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:13,130
if I have access to, I know, I know that everybody that has one of these does this shit,

161
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,849
but if it can put a little bit of a robotic tune to my voice, whether there's a robot on the screen,

162
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:22,650
like I, I'm going to enhance my volume and my data that I'm putting through to the street.

163
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:30,819
Oh, you certainly put on quite a show, but it looks like everyone's on.

164
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:40,970
No, how would they do this? All right. Well, talk to me. Isn't this the inspector?

165
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:52,420
Talk to the inspector. What the heck? The police saw us crash land and came to check up on us.

166
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:58,099
Ramps is the, you certainly put on quite a show. That was close. I was in the same ballpark.

167
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:09,099
Let me welcome you to catalogs Island. I'd like to ask one of you to come with me to the station.

168
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:13,130
We need you to fill out some Bernie voice for the Bernie voice.

169
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,410
Can you do anything besides a Bernie voice? You can't enter the city without me.

170
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:28,410
Don't worry. It won't take very long while you're waiting. You can spend your time

171
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:34,250
in the shopping arcade next to the city. You don't need an ID card to get in there.

172
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:47,579
Are you ready to go professor? Go to the arcade? Are you fucking kidding me? How much is the arcade?

173
00:31:48,220 --> 00:32:11,819
And why is this the best game ever? Ditched. Wait, did they? So wait, me and Roll were left behind.

174
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:28,700
So they deemed the save game little monkey character more important than me. I can understand,

175
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,779
like grandpa, he's the guy, he's the one that has to repair the ship and has to give a police

176
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:49,339
report. What's the save monkey doing there? What's this? Oh, that was cool. All right,

177
00:32:49,339 --> 00:33:06,740
hold on. This is kind of bright. Failure. Taylor. Oh, let's go in. I can put new clothes.

178
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,069
That customer there spends all his time staring at the mirror and never buys anything.

179
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:22,490
Look at me. Am I cool or what? Yes, you are. Yep. Yes. So far the coolest character in the game so

180
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,690
far. I don't know what this guy's problem is. You should let him stay as long as he wants.

181
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:45,849
This is Apple Market, the biggest shopping center on Catalox Island. Why is it called Apple Market?

182
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:52,650
See those banners up there? When you want to look up or down, push the directional button while

183
00:33:52,650 --> 00:34:03,750
holding down the R2 button. It's called the Apple Market because you decided to have banners that

184
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:11,739
say apple on them with an apple. Not like this town is known for its apples and farming market.

185
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:19,530
No, we just decided it was going to be an apple on a banner. That's interesting. Oh,

186
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:24,179
are you one of the people who just crash landed? Want some fruit? How about some fresh vegetables?

187
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,380
All right, now here we go. Yeah, I do. I want them. Cabbage, mushrooms, carrots. There's a

188
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:36,969
lot of vegetables lined up. There are tomatoes, cucumbers, and other vegetables lined up. Where's

189
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:53,800
the fucking meat? Where's the meat and cheese? Dressmaker hip bone. There's no apples there.

190
00:34:56,329 --> 00:35:02,280
Say, you're kind of cute. Your name's Mega Man, isn't it? Well, you're my type of man. I don't

191
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,809
know if you like looking at women's clothing, but come back and see me anytime. That was a little

192
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:19,989
forward. A high welcome to town would have been nice at first. I really like this dress.

193
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:31,179
Do you think it would look good on me? Yeah, I mean, sure. Really? Will you buy it for me then?

194
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,059
Who are these people? Who are you fucking people? No. Oh, don't worry. I was just

195
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:49,539
kidding. Hi, Mega Man. Welcome to town. I love you. Okay. Mega Man, do you think this looks good?

196
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:56,440
Buy it for me. What the fuck? Who are these two people? Get out of here. They must know I'm famous.

197
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,530
Like, they think I'm like loaded. Is Mega Man loaded? Probably. Caprica.

198
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:14,219
I mean, this is like late Mega Man, right? He's like 22 or 25 or something. Isn't he in this game?

199
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:22,519
He's probably got like 10 million in the bank. Have you heard about the ruins just outside the

200
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:29,699
gate? You can go inside even if you don't have a digger's license. I hear the junk shop owner

201
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:34,340
next door is always going in. They're looking for parts. We have our grind missions. That's pretty

202
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,820
cool. What do you got here for me? Anybody give any fucking cheddar cheese? My favorite cheese.

203
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:54,090
This is my dog, Paprika. He's cute, isn't he? Yeah, he is. That reminds me. I fucking love dogs.

204
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:01,190
It's a box. Is there anything inside? There's a refractor shard inside. You found 100 zenny.

205
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:10,230
I'm gonna just throw $100 away. Why? It's a garbage pill. There's a refractor shard inside.

206
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:23,559
You found 20 zenny. Excuse me. This is my dumpster. Anything inside? It's empty. All right. Um, cool.

207
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:29,619
This is a nice little area. Did I not do anything? Wait, there's like, oh, toys. Wait, hold on.

208
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:37,099
Yeah, of course. I didn't do the entire right side of the mall. They're trying to fix inflation.

209
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:50,780
Leave that shit in the trash. Broken cleaner? What? I think I find items. Who are these people?

210
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:56,139
You're looking for the treasure too, aren't you? Just like that girl was here a minute ago.

211
00:37:56,139 --> 00:38:03,190
Well, I don't know nothing about it. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell a stranger like you.

212
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:09,210
By the way, do you think that this vest looks good in these sneakers? Yeah, they do.

213
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:17,289
I hear you're loaded. Can you buy them for me? There's been a lot of strangers coming here lately.

214
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:28,309
I don't like strangers. Yeah, you don't look like you're from around here either. Go away.

215
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:42,579
What if I wasn't here? Record shop? What is this? There's a listening station where you can listen

216
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:50,869
to CDs. Can I find CDs and play them? Boy, this song is really good. What OST are you listening to?

217
00:38:50,869 --> 00:39:10,150
What OST is he listening to? There's a jazz CD on the player. Remember we talked about jazz

218
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:26,659
yesterday? In German, not all music is OST, but all music in a video game is an OST because it's

219
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:32,099
part of the game's OST. For instance, this song we're listening to right now is on the Mega Man

220
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:46,019
Legends OST. I wanted to get a CD, but I didn't have enough money. So I'm just going to listen

221
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:51,530
to the samples. Oh my God. I remember this. Holy shit. You guys. All right. Some of you guys that

222
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,690
are old enough. Do you remember going into the record store, the CD store and being able to

223
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:02,889
listen to like an eight second sample of the CD? Wow. They had these headphones that were lined up

224
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:08,250
on the cases of the CDs and you could listen to samples. I forgot about that.

225
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:15,210
And it was always so stupid. I fucking hated it so much because every time you scanned one to play

226
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:20,969
a sample from the album or from a single, it would pick a random spot. It wouldn't play the

227
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:27,510
bridge or the chorus, but you'd have an insanely famous song and it would play like in the middle

228
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:34,309
of the second verse. It's like, I want to fucking give me the chorus. Not that

229
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:42,099
what are you doing? You caught me right in the middle of your second verse. That's not what I

230
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:50,440
wanted to hear. That's a bad sample. Be sure to listen to our sample CDs before you leave.

231
00:40:50,440 --> 00:41:04,780
All right. Where's the arcade? I'll spend an hour walking around here. I don't care. I love this.

232
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,780
Electronic goods store. It's an electronic shop, but the junk store probably has a better selection

233
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:25,030
of parts. Yeah, but what's in it though? 50% off a TV. Can I buy this stuff? It's a TV, but it's too

234
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:35,110
big to carry home. That's not too big to carry home. What? You can definitely. All right. If you

235
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:40,889
can carry a 24 pack of water to your car, you can carry that to your car. Mega Man, please.

236
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:54,780
What else is in here? It's a VCR, but you don't need one. I already got one. Oh, it's a Tesla

237
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:06,469
fridge. It's a refrigerator. What do you do? Parts for a flying ship. You're better off looking at

238
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:16,039
the junk store. All this stuff in here is junk. Everything's 50% off. You got nothing full priced

239
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:23,210
in here, man. You're selling an old fridge for like 30% off. Here you break. Toy store. Yep.

240
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,280
This is that new game called Mega Man Legends. It looks pretty interesting.

241
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:49,989
Can I play the game within the game? All right. Junk shop. Where's the arcade? Ego Mania Mania. Oh,

242
00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:56,119
man. This is not even. All right. This is a lost and found. This is not even a junk shop.

243
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:04,659
Junk shop lady. Parts for your ship. I'm sorry, but my husband's out on a dig right now.

244
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:09,320
You know what a dig is, right? It's where you go underground looking for old machine parts.

245
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:16,360
That's condescending. I wonder what's taking him so long. Hey, little blue boy. Would you be willing

246
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:22,360
to go find him for me? Yeah, sure. You will? Oh, thank you so much. You'll probably find him

247
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,619
somewhere near the entrance. He's really just a big coward, you see. So I don't think he's gone too

248
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:37,900
far in. What do you have here? He's 100% dead. It's a stuffed re-robot. It's an old family heirloom.

249
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:55,130
We call it Rover. Let's go find the junk guy. All right. No arcade? Where's the arcade? Look at

250
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:02,969
how happy the dog is. Oh, I know somebody that like just got out of the bath. You just took a bath.

251
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:08,260
Yep. The only difference is you're not like rolling around on your back and going.

252
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:26,599
All right. So we need to go to the. All right. Let's get out of here. Can I throw this away?

253
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:41,769
Can I open the garbage and throw it away? Wait, there's 50 dollars in here. All right. Kick it in

254
00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:58,679
in the basket. No, whatever. I love the way this is. Look at this. Bang! Bang! I love it. I just saw

255
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:03,239
an older man go inside those ruins over there. I wonder if he'll be all right. If you want to

256
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:10,170
go check on him, you should probably save first. If you want to save, just talk to me, okay? Okay.

257
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:28,820
I forgot. I know I forgot. The man of five voices. He can go like this. He can go like this.

258
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:40,539
He can go like this. He can go like this. The man of five voices. All right. The ruins. Let's go

259
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:58,739
in the ruins. Where are the ruins? The ruins over there. Over here? This isn't the guy's store.

260
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:22,219
I thought this was the guy's store. Oh, man's voice. Help. Somebody help. Dungeon time. Look

261
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:45,860
at the parts too. I need junk parts. Oh, easy. Can I move when I'm locked on? I can't move when

262
00:46:45,860 --> 00:47:04,329
I'm locked on, huh? All right. Let's get this money. All right. So if I move... Okay. I can't

263
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:13,050
move left and right. Is it like a dodge or like a... That's kick. Part two. Left, up, down. No. No.

264
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:40,500
How do I do that dodge? Why am I playing the worst Mega Man? What? What? What? Hold on. Dude,

265
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:47,670
that's like I'm eating my favorite spaghetti dish in my favorite restaurant. And you walk up

266
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:52,309
as somebody that's never been to the restaurant before. Or maybe you have and you don't like it,

267
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:55,670
but you tap me on the shoulder and go, hey, the spaghetti here sucks. It's the worst. The meat

268
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:59,190
sauce is terrible. In fact, I think there's rats in the kitchen and then you leave.

269
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:13,820
What? Help me. Where is this guy? There's got to be a way I can do that dodge.

270
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:47,260
Yikes. I'll take the range. Oh, fuck. Can I only get that dodge roll if I do the other control

271
00:48:47,260 --> 00:49:22,489
scheme? R1 plus X. Ah, yes. Yes. Yes. Look at how much better this is. Does that help? Oh my.

272
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:43,159
Apologize for what? I just airstropped that guy. What? What am I apologizing for? What did I do?

273
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:57,940
I didn't do anything. There is just a secret. Don't worry. I ain't going anywhere.

274
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:14,940
Thanks. You saved my life. Phew. Thank you. Ah, Mr. Blue boy. Come on by my junk shop.

275
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,849
I'll give you some thing as a token of my appreciation. If you don't know what you did,

276
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:26,679
it's worse. Is this about the like, yes thing? Don't worry about me. If nothing else, I'm a

277
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:40,070
fast runner and I'll make it out okay. I ain't saying sorry. I ain't saying sorry for that one.

278
00:50:40,949 --> 00:50:49,800
Not going to happen. Let's go get secrets. He didn't do anything wrong. Yeah. What did I do

279
00:50:49,800 --> 00:51:10,329
that was wrong? Oh no. Minus two. Unbased streamer. Unbased. I got to find, let's look,

280
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:33,159
I got to look for some secrets. Any secrets? Secret. There's a hole in the wall. Is there

281
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:37,800
anything inside? You found a refractor shard. You got 20. That's a lot of money.

282
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:54,179
It looks like a binding of an Isaac. I got to get up there. How do I get up there? Like is there like

283
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:58,980
zoom shoes? Zoomer shoes or something? Like jump shoes?

284
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:10,579
I don't think I can get up there. All right. Well, let's go with the actual exit.

285
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:34,579
I got money now. Boss? Oh, wait, hold on. Easy. Oh, it's the classic Mega Man villain. I'm not

286
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:37,940
going to do anything until you get too close and then I'm going to come up and I'm going to have

287
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:52,199
Oh my god. Did I get the money?

288
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:11,050
Nice. Wait, what's that? Nothing. The sound design is dope. Yeah, it actually is pretty good.

289
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:34,329
Is it going to blow stuff up? Ow. That hurt. Hitbox fucking hitbox reddit, whatever it is.

290
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:55,829
Is there only one guy in here? No, there's two. Be careful. This is a tough room. Does that guy

291
00:53:55,829 --> 00:54:11,670
move? All right, let's let's get this cheesed. Okay, that's done. Now just get in. Let's fight.

292
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:46,599
Don't stop saying reddit shit. Unbased. Oh, that was a good chest move he predicted. He just

293
00:54:46,599 --> 00:55:13,510
walked into the wall though. Big money. Zero out of ten. Unbased. Oh yeah. Rapid fire. Rapid

294
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,510
fire is a Mega Man buster part. Attaching buster parts allows you to power up your weapons.

295
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:21,989
You can attach buster parts by pressing the start button to go to the menu screen and selecting

296
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:29,300
equip from the buster parts menu. I think I stayed in here. So I'm gonna have two on. Equip

297
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:35,860
up. Rapid fire increases rapid. They can have two parts on at the same time. So I have.

298
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:52,039
Let's take a look. How much better is it? A little better. Oh, we'll test it on you.

299
00:55:53,079 --> 00:56:06,260
You can get at least three. Yeah, eventually probably. I don't remember much from the game.

300
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,619
Besides, that was good that I got. All right, anything else in here? No. Leave the ruins.

301
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:18,860
You can strafe while locked on. You cannot. You cannot. I believe that is somebody said that is

302
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:33,800
only in Mega Man Legends 2. Yes, you can. Are you sure that's not a suit upgrade or something I get

303
00:56:33,800 --> 00:57:04,059
later? It was. It was. They were. They're jaking you. Did you bait? Oh, big door. There's a wall

304
00:57:04,059 --> 00:57:14,489
in the way. Maybe if you had something to break through it with. Worth a shot. All right, I got

305
00:57:14,489 --> 00:57:20,260
money and I just rescued the guy. So what else is it? Nothing. Nothing. I can't get up there.

306
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:46,760
Come on. No. Mega small. Is German in a space cam is on? What the fuck, dude? Use the ladder?

307
00:57:46,760 --> 00:58:13,929
We would ladder. In the other room? Wait, what am I getting lied to? Ladder in the first room.

308
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:31,639
Oh, that's a ladder. Oh, that's a ladder. I thought that was just cool artwork on that. I didn't know

309
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:39,320
that was a ladder. It was like, all right, here we go. I'm back. Hey, look at this. It looks like

310
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:49,980
Spotter's car. I wonder if it would run if we would fix it up. Probably. I hear you helped out

311
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,539
with the junk store owner. He says he wants to thank you. So you should stop by his store later.

312
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:13,000
Good job. This dude is just vibing. Yeah. He hates the auto voice. No, I will. I just keep forgetting.

313
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:50,710
Back to the junk store. Wait, another person here? Where do I kick this? Somebody said behind the

314
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:59,420
counter. Behind the bakery counter? Is that real? All right, I'm gonna go for it. Get it behind the

315
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:26,309
bakery counter. Well, you must really hate this place. You look like a Slytherin. Yes, I know.

316
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:31,269
I know. I look like a Slytherin. And if I tell you I'm Slytherin, that means I'm actually Hufflepuff.

317
01:00:31,989 --> 01:00:35,909
And if I get Hufflepuff on a test, it means I'm actually Slytherin in real life.

318
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:49,239
That's how this works. Got it. Nice shot. Thousands, any. Keep our streets clean. Put

319
01:00:49,239 --> 01:01:08,949
trash in its proper place. All right. Junk store. I mean, in the bakery. Wait, what? Bakery is

320
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:15,590
behind the bakery counter. Our trash belongs in the bakery. What the fuck? Fuck the bakery. What

321
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:28,889
are you guys doing? Oh, you came back. The bakery has aggressive energy. Were you surprised I came

322
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:34,679
back? I'm here for my reward actually. Oh shit, I didn't think you'd be back. Thank you so much. I

323
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:40,969
don't know what I would have happened if you hadn't gone looking for junk store man. Ha ha ha ha ha.

324
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:47,380
Thanks for helping me out back there. Here, take this as a reward. You got mine parts kit.

325
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:54,519
Did you see that old beat up car outside the city walls? That's the car we used as our support car

326
01:01:55,659 --> 01:02:01,030
when we were younger. Anyway, you can have it if you want. It doesn't run anymore, but you should

327
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:08,789
be able to use it to exchange buster parts and stuff. Like storage. It's a stash. You're looking

328
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:13,590
for parts for your ship, right? No, I don't have anything like that here, but I've got weapons and

329
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:18,389
upgrades and other stuff I can sell you. Why? Why are you the store that has all this stuff?

330
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:28,300
What did you say your name was? My name is Hippopotamus. Hippopotamus? What kind of name is

331
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:46,150
that? Well, anyway, come back soon, Mr. Hippopotamus. Only you guys know. Oh, I was the

332
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:59,670
digger and he was my spotter. I'm back to buy something. Parts for a flying ship. I want to

333
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:08,920
buy. Do you want me to come back and buy something? If you got a Class B digger's license, you can get

334
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:16,500
into the ruins in the southern forest or the one up the north in the closer woods. All right. Well,

335
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:28,940
thanks for nothing. They were just being polite. Hey, slow. No running. No running. You're going to

336
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,099
slip and fall in the pool. You know, what it is around the edges. God, people just don't ever

337
01:03:33,099 --> 01:03:42,699
fucking understand that rule. Who are you? Are you a digger? I'm here going doing research on the

338
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:50,940
ruins of this island here. Sure. A lot of them aren't there. That's what I used to go. They were

339
01:03:50,940 --> 01:04:09,050
just being polite. They usually don't have any stuff here. Well, OK. Come on up north. Thanks

340
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:21,260
for nothing. Drunk shop. That's the stuff. Yeah. OK, goodbye. We sell parts and upgrades and armor.

341
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:45,940
Come back. Whatever. All right. Now let's go turn that car on. I've got parts. Do you need to do it?

342
01:04:46,579 --> 01:04:56,070
Mega man, were you able to find anything? Voice acting. If you can't find any parts in town,

343
01:04:56,969 --> 01:05:02,099
I guess we'll have to try digging for them ourselves. That's what the man at the junk

344
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:12,650
store said. That might take a while, which means. I don't know if. Mega man, what's that? That's

345
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:18,809
what the man at the junk store told me. His info you should really go off of for much. Yeah. The

346
01:05:18,809 --> 01:05:26,409
junk store man gave it to me. He said we could use this car to hook it up. Mega man. You mean

347
01:05:26,409 --> 01:05:33,050
we can use this car? Well, come on then. Junk store man. He's really putting a lot of weight on

348
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:38,969
the junk store man's stuff in the things he says. Have you talked to the mayor yet? It's ready.

349
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:48,460
This weapon lets you use landmines. Just drop them in front of an oncoming enemy. And just remember,

350
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,619
there's a limited number of mines, so make sure you use them sparingly.

351
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:59,699
Do you want me to explain what this weapon does again? I'll get to work on fixing this car up.

352
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:04,579
I'll be able to help you out and maybe spot for you if I can get it running again.

353
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:14,219
Item development. Once the support car is fixed, I'll be able to use it to make all sorts of new

354
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:18,699
things. If you find something interesting, bring it here. You never know what I might be able to

355
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:21,739
make for you. All right. That's it. Yeah. We get like a mobile development.

356
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:38,500
More stuff to give. Wow. I only had to walk around for 10 minutes.

357
01:06:47,909 --> 01:06:48,630
Citizenship.

358
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:05,940
And locking the gates evacuating. Our grandfather is still inside the city.

359
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:13,099
Will he be all right? Well, I'm sure he's heard the announcements about the pirates.

360
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:25,050
Oh, that's that's not. Yes. That's not. Yes. If you'll excuse me, I'm worried about grants.

361
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:32,860
I hope he'll be OK. I'll go look for him. You wait here. We're evacuating the city.

362
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:46,969
Pirates, eh? Well, they shouldn't give you any trouble. But be careful anyway, OK? I did it.

363
01:07:48,889 --> 01:08:11,320
I did it. I did it. That was perfect. I thought this was a Canadian forest. Let's go. So I have

364
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:16,119
my citizen's key card now. It doesn't look like much of an evacuation.

365
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,840
Hey, we're having a secret meeting. Get out of here.

366
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:35,300
If I'm careful, I should be able to get close without them noticing. You can move slowly by

367
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:49,609
pressing circle and the directional button at the same time. Is this sneaking or is this

368
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:58,060
more pronounced than what I was just doing? That's like the get the fuck out of my way walk.

369
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:01,260
Whisper, whisper. That girl looks suspicious, I tell you.

370
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:08,949
She has to be a pirate. She said she was looking for treasure.

371
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:15,819
No one believes us. We're going to have to get her ourselves. Hey, someone's spying on us.

372
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:39,939
It's that blue guy again. Come on, everybody. Let's go. OK, got it. Once the decision's made,

373
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:46,420
there's no turning back. The pirate. Nothing less than 100 percent. And remember, it's more than

374
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:52,500
just guns and ships. Holy shit. It's whoever has the most information that wins, right?

375
01:09:52,500 --> 01:10:01,350
That's what they got the entire idea from. We understand. Keep your costs as low as possible

376
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:08,329
and stay on schedule. And they just scrambled all the dialogue so they can just localize it

377
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:24,949
for free everywhere. Holy shit. Genius. Wait, that's me? I thought I was a camera.

378
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:45,720
Wait, you just drew. Hey, pay attention. I was in a fucking crosswalk. There's nobody driving

379
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:55,909
these cars. Kick mailbox. Kick mailbox. It's a mailbox, but you don't need to send any letters.

380
01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:06,819
I bet you the cop does it too. Do they crash into each other? Uh oh, big school bus. Haven't you

381
01:11:06,819 --> 01:11:12,340
heard about the pirates? Everyone in town's evacuating. You'd be small. OK, that's why

382
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:28,859
everyone's getting fucked up. I get it. I know everyone's afraid and wants to get away,

383
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:33,500
but they should be more careful when they drive. You better watch out too and make

384
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:48,090
sure you don't get run over. I know. Oh my god. It's a fire hydrant. You could probably jump on

385
01:11:48,090 --> 01:12:10,729
top of it. OK, and why did I do that? Garbage pail. Is there anything inside? No. Achievement.

386
01:12:10,729 --> 01:12:24,329
In the back of the guest truck. Yes. Nice. Ice cream. Vending machine. Do you want to put a

387
01:12:24,329 --> 01:12:41,000
hundred zenny in? Yes. You got a soft drink. Pretty good cat puke sound. Nice. You got a soft drink

388
01:12:41,000 --> 01:13:05,270
for free. One more. Hey guys. I love it. Thief. It's quiet inside. Looks like everyone's evacuated.

389
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:23,300
All right, let's go. This is a plant. Nice bitrate, idiot. What? Oh, that's all right. Nice. Cool.

390
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:43,529
Um, wait, no. Mega Man, look out for that car. Mega Man, watch out for the car. The audio is

391
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:49,220
desynced on me or on the game? Because I could probably fix it. What are you? Is it me desynced?

392
01:13:49,220 --> 01:14:10,970
We'll do a test. Ready? Ready? Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. It's fine. The bus stops, actually.

393
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:20,979
Really good driver. Thank you. Smartest person in the game. Look at that. What about you? Test

394
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:37,479
number two. No. He just saw. He just saw the bus stop. What? I just went down to the sewer?

395
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:42,039
Oh, nice. All right. Like dungeon. Let's go. Why didn't it just say it like that? Dungeon.

396
01:14:57,079 --> 01:15:10,520
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is just. Oh, okay. This is where it was before. It's all

397
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:25,479
connected. Can I do anything in here? This game's kind of like Doxels. Yeah, kind of, kid.

398
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:54,390
Oh, enemy. I can't fire right now. Police. Fire it. Huh? What do you want? You've been following

399
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:58,550
me all around all day, haven't you? Sorry, but I don't have time to play with you.

400
01:15:59,189 --> 01:16:12,069
Just stay out of my way. Okay. Oh, don't you know that all civilians are supposed to be evacuated?

401
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:16,949
You just like that girl over there. Don't you know you're supposed to do what adults tell you to do?

402
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:33,909
I thought he was going to walk into the road and get like clipped. This is really bright.

403
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:40,569
It's a fountain. Watching it makes you feel very relaxed.

404
01:16:42,739 --> 01:16:51,159
Unanimated electricity. Wouldn't this kill me? I've got like 400 pounds of electricity on me.

405
01:16:53,449 --> 01:17:07,159
The bank. There's a bank. The pirates aren't coming, are they? Please say they're not. ATM?

406
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:12,119
It's an automated teller machine, but you can't use it. You don't have any money in the bank.

407
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,220
Well, let's go. Let's open up an account. It's getting too dangerous here.

408
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:21,800
I'm thinking that maybe we should shut down temporarily. This is the bank.

409
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,079
Completing on evacuating. Please be sure to withdraw money first.

410
01:17:26,039 --> 01:17:29,880
No, don't tell everyone to withdraw their money first. That's how you crash the whole economy.

411
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:36,310
The desk filling up forms. Pens are attached to the desk by a chain.

412
01:17:37,029 --> 01:17:46,819
It's a comfortable looking sofa. I figured that since I was evacuating,

413
01:17:46,819 --> 01:17:52,340
I should withdraw my money from my account, but I forgot I only have 980 zenny in the bank.

414
01:17:53,140 --> 01:18:04,069
Why are you telling me how much money you have? Wait, you can't take it out?

415
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:13,529
All right. At that point, I'm going to be like, all right, hey, dude, here's a 20.

416
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:28,039
Just put it in and then take it out. Have a nice day. What? Knock, knock. Looks like nobody's home.

417
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:51,140
The legendary mega... Yeah. No, what's on the other side of this gate? The Yas Plains. The Yas

418
01:18:51,699 --> 01:18:57,619
Plains. That's what. Right now, it's full of people who've evacuated from the city,

419
01:18:57,619 --> 01:19:20,460
so it's a little crowded. Oh, chat, chat. What are you going to say about that one? I wonder.

420
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:32,279
Dermot, this fucking music never ends. It's just standard default background. You're in town music.

421
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:49,739
All right. City hall. Let's go to city hall. Is there anything else up here that I need to do

422
01:19:49,739 --> 01:20:16,409
that I didn't do? That's my favorite part. It's coming up right now. We got city hall, downtown.

423
01:20:16,409 --> 01:20:25,689
So where should I be going? Pirates are attacking. Where are the pirates attacking from?

424
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:50,619
You're such a fucking elf. Big building. Police. Let's go to police station. Holy shit, this game

425
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:59,239
looks like shit. This game came out before you were born, probably. This game came out before you were

426
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:15,050
even alive. It looks different from the ones in the downtown area. This game came out in like 1998.

427
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:28,420
You were born in 1999. It looks pretty good if we're coming out in 1999. I'm not here to

428
01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:40,819
spy. No, not me. With these pirates running around, I'm glad we have such a well-trained

429
01:21:40,819 --> 01:21:47,220
police force. To the news. It's a newspaper. Let's see what it says. Flying ship crashes in

430
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:54,090
forest. No injuries reported. That's the last article. Not much happens here. No matter how

431
01:21:54,090 --> 01:22:01,300
brave those pirates might be, they wouldn't attack the police station. Would they? I don't know.

432
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:06,439
Turns out your grandfather, Professor Barrell, is an old friend of the mayor's. I didn't know

433
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:14,170
he was such a renowned archaeologist. The cat is getting toxic and we have sub-only mode. Turn it on.

434
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:25,779
Turn it on. Our job as police officers is to serve and protect the people of Catalogues Island.

435
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:41,659
Only authorized personnel are allowed inside the office. Don't I have a citizen card for this shit?

436
01:22:42,460 --> 01:23:00,090
Oh, they're cheating. They're using only authorized chat only. Or you gotta pay channel points.

437
01:23:01,819 --> 01:23:15,430
Oh man. City hall? Is this a church or is this city hall? This is a church. Uh oh. Sorry, no

438
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:24,739
unauthorized entry allowed. Do you have a business here? Sub-only mode is meaningless. He's in a

439
01:23:24,739 --> 01:23:30,890
meeting with the mayor. Please wait one minute. All right, turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

440
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:35,050
Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. No, no, keep it on. Keep it on.

441
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:38,569
Keep it on. Make him waste all their points so I don't have to wink. Keep it on. Keep it on. Make

442
01:23:38,569 --> 01:23:52,250
him waste all their points so I don't have to wink ever again. Hey, Mega Man! Yes. Here, let me

443
01:23:52,250 --> 01:24:01,800
introduce you to the mayor of this island, Amelia. Amelia, nice to meet you. I'm an old friend of

444
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:11,220
Professor Barrell's. I worked as his assistant for a while. While I was in school. I don't have a

445
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:16,899
fucking backpack on. To tell you the truth, we've gotten reports that-

446
01:24:16,899 --> 01:24:20,500
Keep it on. Keep it on. Make him waste all their fucking points. I was asking the professor if he

447
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:29,560
might have any idea what they're after. Anything thereafter the legend supposedly buried on this

448
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:38,119
island. There are a lot of stories about the treasure. Knows exactly what it is. I thought

449
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:43,960
maybe you might know something about it, professor. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. That's a pretty sick

450
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:50,039
creamsicle hair. But I haven't been able to find out anything about this island. I strive for that

451
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:56,539
every day. Except legends and myths. Fuck, Mega Man. I'll be here for a while talking with Amelia.

452
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:03,659
So why don't you go back and keep an eye on her? Tell her not to worry about me, okay?

453
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:08,460
Thanks to the five community subs at the Starfish. Congratulations to the winners.

454
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:17,210
What do you have to say? Sub only is useless. I know. Or, I mean, is it? This is a-

455
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:25,239
This is my equivalent to World of Warcraft letting you level up to 60 for like $5 or $10,

456
01:25:25,239 --> 01:25:31,750
whatever it was. Wow, that ruined the whole game, didn't it? Holy shit. You could- You can buy-

457
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:38,229
You can pay like $10 and just level the fuck up to max level with a new character.

458
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:44,949
Holy shit. I forgot about that. What did they want me to do? I was- I was paying attention to the

459
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:52,470
tyrant that I am. Very Treasured is the legend that says it- that says if the seals are broken,

460
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:57,029
a terrible disaster will occur. Even if it's only a legend as mayor of this island,

461
01:25:57,029 --> 01:26:05,800
I can't ignore anything that might threaten it. I'm going to stay here and talk with Amelia.

462
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:12,739
You take care of Role in case those pirates show up. All right, is it like any money in the desk?

463
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:22,060
Why is the chat sub only? It's a 9- 100 million IQ play to make people waste all their fucking

464
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:29,989
points and it's working. You're from out of town, aren't you? Are you a digger? Don't worry,

465
01:26:29,989 --> 01:26:35,189
everyone here is very friendly. You may not know your way around yet, but you'll find that you'll

466
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:41,640
get along just fine. I don't have any problem. All right, I'm probably gonna get- I'm gonna get

467
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:55,000
cutscenes here in a second, aren't I? Yeah, here comes a cutscene. I'm like, what do you mean it's

468
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:23,510
a dog? Who is- am I pretending to be them or are they pretending to be me with the kind of

469
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:27,989
stretching up on the toes thing? Do I see the adults doing that? And I'm like, yeah, I did that

470
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:49,590
too. I don't know. Wow, he was trying to hit me. All right, um, let's go back. He went around.

471
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:55,689
He circled back. Hey, Frank, we didn't hit that fucking kid, did we? No, no, no, no, we didn't.

472
01:27:56,489 --> 01:28:04,739
Turn around and fucking drill them. But it's true, officer. My paprika found a suspicious

473
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:13,899
looking girl. She must be a pirate. Please come here to check things out. I'm sure of it.

474
01:28:13,899 --> 01:28:34,199
Okay, bye. We sell stuff only on- nice, keep it on. What's going on over here? What did you do to

475
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:50,890
upset my dog? What? What do you got? You got like- what are you- what are you- well, what are you

476
01:28:50,890 --> 01:29:04,979
doing? I need to get like a bone or something. All right, well, should I say stop? Did I give

477
01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:19,460
food to dog? You don't understand. I'll translate.

478
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:42,810
No, he didn't say anything after that. That was it. He just wanted to tell Megaman that he was hungry.

479
01:29:54,439 --> 01:30:00,460
Holy shit. That was one of the worms from like a worm's armageddon. That's what they- that's what

480
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:03,739
they look like. I was trying to figure it out for the longest time. I haven't said anything yet.

481
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:10,649
But they have- they have worms faces. I was like, what the fuck do they look like?

482
01:30:11,289 --> 01:30:21,979
I'm like the worms franchise. Sub chat is worse. All right, turn it off. Turn it off.

483
01:30:21,979 --> 01:30:33,260
Break- like sub chat is worse. Turn it off. It's a junk store. No, I want to talk to this person.

484
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:40,869
Hey hippopotamus, what's up? We're always open for business no matter what. If we can do anything

485
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:51,060
for you, just ask. All right, now does that mean I can buy something? Yep. Ooh, 8,480

486
01:30:52,020 --> 01:31:00,899
time currency. Whatever that is. All right, buy parts. Power razor. Ooh, range booster. Turbo

487
01:31:00,899 --> 01:31:10,180
charger. Dude, I could get double power booster. Double power booster, I think I want to do.

488
01:31:12,649 --> 01:31:30,649
Real wink. Why does it do that? All right, I'm doing double power booster. Give it to me. Power

489
01:31:30,649 --> 01:31:41,779
booster. What about items? Life gauge. Adds one point to life gauge. What? Yeah. Ooh, I could do

490
01:31:41,779 --> 01:31:49,159
that. Another one? Repairs damage- repairs damage to life shield. Used to restore life gauge. Can

491
01:31:49,159 --> 01:31:59,909
be refilled. All right, no, the energy canteen. Extra pack adds points to the canteen. All right,

492
01:31:59,909 --> 01:32:08,710
I don't want to use all my money. I'll get one more point to the life gauge though. Fuck. Shield

493
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:16,760
repairs damage to life shield. Adds points to get another canteen. Oh, god damn it. Another one.

494
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:28,489
God damn it. One more. And another one. Shield repair. Life gauge. Done. All right, let's get

495
01:32:28,489 --> 01:32:38,949
up. Refill the canteen. All right, what about sell? Parts. All right, so. All right, hold on a minute

496
01:32:38,949 --> 01:32:50,659
here. Sell this shitty power razor and equip the new one and keep the rapid fire on. Life gauge is

497
01:32:50,659 --> 01:32:57,399
goodbye. Yeah. You get money so easily, don't sell it. No point in selling. It's not even any- oh.

498
01:33:00,729 --> 01:33:07,539
Cool. Look at that. Look at that life. Nice. All right, let me, uh. Bust the parts. Equip.

499
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:14,100
Should I- all right. Power razor. Double power razor and just have a ton of attack? Or should I

500
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:22,359
cap- I think I'm going to keep that on for now. Double power. The rapid fire is not that fast.

501
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:31,100
Each person that says this game sucks, I'd like for you to delete their account.

502
01:33:31,819 --> 01:33:58,329
You guys have dedicated mods. Can you do that? Mods. Mods. Mods. Mods. What do they sound like?

503
01:33:58,329 --> 01:34:04,010
Omega. Omega man. Omega lol.

504
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:15,609
What? He's talking with the mayor at city hall. I hope he'll be okay. Did you see those weird

505
01:34:15,609 --> 01:34:23,000
looking ships that just flew past here? I've never seen ones like that before. I wonder whose they are.

506
01:34:30,439 --> 01:34:34,600
There goes one. No. Roll. That's just- that was just a projection.

507
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:51,619
Oh, there goes one. Uh. The fence is still in there.

508
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:56,489
Mega man, I'm going to go make sure he's all right.

509
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:15,210
I haven't eaten all day. You want the carrots in here? I'm useless unless I fucking eat. All right,

510
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:28,500
let's go. There's birds that are louder than the war going on in the city. Roll, hold on. Oh shit.

511
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:47,909
I'm sorry. I'm obsessive. Holy shit. This song. Oh my god. I- okay. This is where that song is from.

512
01:35:47,989 --> 01:35:56,840
I- I tried to remember what this was and I'm not even talking about recently. I'm talking about

513
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:03,029
like two or three years ago. This. I was like what the fuck is that from? I hum it all the time.

514
01:36:03,829 --> 01:36:12,180
You know when something just like snaps into your brain like that and you realize how much you cared

515
01:36:12,899 --> 01:36:16,979
two or three years ago and now you just don't at all and you're like wow why did I care that much?

516
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:33,239
But cool. Now that I'm glad I know this. Yeah, this is the before the boss.

517
01:36:39,659 --> 01:36:43,100
Oh my god. This is night. This is my I've had nightmares with this music in it and I've tried

518
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:49,829
to figure out what the fuck it was. That's what I know. That's what's going on. I've had nightmares

519
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:58,439
like we could fucked up dreams with this song was play in the background slower and like the

520
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:17,609
tempo was just decreased. Holy shit. This is fucking messed up like slower like oh my god.

521
01:37:17,609 --> 01:37:23,050
This is insane. I forgot. This is kind of like I'm gonna have to like go.

522
01:37:34,579 --> 01:37:45,140
Hold it right there. You can't go in there. This area is closed off. Please officer let us through.

523
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:55,050
And father's in there. You can't go in either. It's dangerous. How about this? We arm wrestle

524
01:37:55,050 --> 01:38:00,260
and if I win in less than a tenth of a second I get to go in. Those pirates have attacked the

525
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:06,140
island. We'll find out. Just like they said they would. They're after the treasure that's supposed

526
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:17,060
to be buried here. Enough talk. You have to leave here now. Pirates. They've occupied the gate over

527
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:24,699
there. I'll take care of it. They're too heavily armed. We can't even get close to them. I can.

528
01:38:24,699 --> 01:38:34,859
Maybe I can do something. Mega man I'm going with you. No role is too dangerous. Let me handle this.

529
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:48,020
All right you look out for gramps okay. Wait are you crazy? Wait where do you think you're going?

530
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:56,340
He didn't hear that. He was gone. The two different cops there. One cared one didn't at all.

531
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:14,380
But had to make it sound like he did in case he was somebody was around to witness it. I thought

532
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:34,010
it was bone. It's not trombone. It's tron bon. Why would it be bon? Why wouldn't it be trombone?

533
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:42,739
That is way more tron bon. No tron bon. Like a tron bon. Get the key to the gate. One of the three

534
01:39:42,739 --> 01:39:46,100
serp bots has the key. They can pass it back and forth between them so you'll have to figure out

535
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:52,220
which one of them has it. Each of the three serp bots robots is unique and has different capabilities.

536
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:56,539
Red is built for combat. Blue is built for speed. And yellow is built for endurance.

537
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:02,970
Mission start. Oh that hurt.

538
01:40:10,069 --> 01:40:19,779
Dodge. Where's the key? All right let's go for yellow. I'll go I'll go for blue.

539
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:53,079
Kill blue first. Blue's got speed. All right key. Thanks for the key. Mission complete.

540
01:40:53,079 --> 01:40:57,609
Let me hook it. That was a first try. Easy. Okay I want to pick up the money.

541
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:15,300
Time. I can't take my eyes off you for a second can I? Just you wait till we get back. You're

542
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:26,199
in a lot of trouble. Oh no. What was that? Wasn't that the same boy as before?

543
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:36,579
He disabled the bloom bears by himself. I don't understand. Whenever I think about him I get this

544
01:41:36,579 --> 01:41:46,539
funny feeling. Oh forget it. Who cares what this feeling is? It's all his fault. His fault.

545
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:52,060
How dare he? Does she like me? I'll teach him not to mess with me or my kids.

546
01:41:52,939 --> 01:42:00,359
Here we go. Those are your kids? I thought you built them in a factory or something.

547
01:42:00,359 --> 01:42:18,600
Thanks to you everything's a mess now isn't it? Aren't you the girl who's being chased by that dog?

548
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:24,359
Shut up. I don't want to hear about that. Do you know what you've done?

549
01:42:24,359 --> 01:42:29,560
We do have a pretty good boy song in the background. You should have known better than

550
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:35,369
to pick a fight with the bums. Of course if you agree to become one of my servants I suppose

551
01:42:35,369 --> 01:42:47,699
I could forgive you. What do you say? Think so. All right then forget you. Fine see if I care.

552
01:42:47,699 --> 01:42:51,699
I gave you a chance and you turned it down. Don't come back crying to me later.

553
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:42,119
Oh now you've done it. Now you've done it. Now I'm fucking mad. Ooh I got no range. Go for the

554
01:43:42,119 --> 01:43:49,800
legs first. No I got this. This is not it. No no I'm not saying it. This is that's not a correct

555
01:43:49,800 --> 01:44:23,939
line. This is this is this is a giant enemy squid. Ooh that hurt. Cover the bombs. Giant

556
01:44:23,939 --> 01:44:51,140
enemy squid. I like to run and shoot. Very useful. The Mario gal. Whoa that was violent.

557
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:57,800
No it's okay she just got daffy ducked. She'll be fine. I mean you're stronger than I thought.

558
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:18,859
Give you credit for that. Get in quick right. It's not over yet. Don't think you've won.

559
01:45:18,859 --> 01:45:25,260
Next time I won't be so easy on you. I'll make sure you pay for this. Let's go.

560
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:33,420
See what would have been really funny would have been door closed and they cut inside and she goes

561
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:53,380
how are we gonna pay for this? I could have wrote this. No come on that's that's a perfect

562
01:45:53,380 --> 01:46:00,460
kids show for the bad guy to be like next time we see each other you'll pay for this. Oh wow

563
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:08,500
scary. Door closed. Turn to the minions. Oh are we gonna pay for this? Really? You don't think

564
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:12,020
that like your 10 year old little brother would have laughed or little sister would laugh at that?

565
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:20,300
Of course they would. You don't have to think it's funny. Your your eight year old kid did.

566
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:35,260
That wasn't that's not for you. That's not for you. Indications are that the mysterious group

567
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:40,979
of pirates will continue its offensive for the foreseeable future. Recapping our top story of

568
01:46:40,979 --> 01:46:46,979
the day at two o'clock this afternoon the city center was attacked by a group of unknown pirates

569
01:46:46,979 --> 01:46:52,020
who demanded they be given the keys to the caves and tunnels underneath. Is that one behind you? The

570
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:57,060
mayor has refused to give in to their demands and is currently under siege alone in city hall.

571
01:46:57,699 --> 01:47:03,300
Local police are helpless in front of the power of the pirates weapons. It may be only a matter

572
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:12,420
of time before city hall is destroyed. Hopes are rapidly fading as I've just been handed this update

573
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:18,020
viewers. It appears that the robots and machines being used to lay siege to the city have been

574
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:28,170
destroyed by a single young boy and now that same boy has come through the gate and is heading

575
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:38,250
towards city hall wait there he is interview i can see him he really is alone can this lone

579
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:27,350

580

606
01:57:22,939 --> 01:57:29,659
i almost missed it next story city hall was attacked by a mysterious group of assailants

607
01:57:29,659 --> 01:57:35,579
this afternoon but their offensive was beaten back by an equally mysterious young boy pictured

608
01:57:35,579 --> 01:57:52,819
here on screen favorite show the news who the heck is that blue boy so bond was defeated but

609
01:57:52,819 --> 01:57:58,180
what about drawn this is a potential disaster we could end up losing a lot of money on this one

610
01:58:05,850 --> 01:58:11,850
all right it's obvious that i diesel bond will have to assume command who needs that key anyway

611
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:17,130
it might take some time and it might take some money but who cares i'll use my ultimate digging

612
01:58:17,130 --> 01:58:22,569
machine the moral wolf to dig up the treasure myself and i won't let any little blue boy get

613
01:58:22,569 --> 01:58:34,380
in my way either that was a great laugh wait a second bond's probably okay but what about

614
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:43,979
drawn i feel like it's talking about the same person tron is okay not bond is fine but bond

615
01:58:43,979 --> 01:59:02,810
is tron tron is tron megaman you did it megaman let's go look for gramps tron and bond bond why

618
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:30,659
like he's a statue actually with your help we were able to keep those pirates from getting the key

619
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:38,180
to the ruins thank you Amelia says she'll give us a digger's license as thanks for helping her

620
01:59:39,539 --> 01:59:46,760
now we'll be able to look for parts to fix the flutter i know it's not much but it's the least i

621
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:59,079
can do for you you got a class a class be like excuse me your honor we got a new problem those

622
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:06,789
pirates have started digging up the northern forest what they weren't able to get the key

623
02:00:07,670 --> 02:00:15,739
so they must be going after the treasure directly i'm amazed they'd go to that much trouble

624
02:00:15,739 --> 02:00:22,920
even if they are criminals you've got to admire their persistence who knows what will happen if

625
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:30,409
they get their hands on the treasure inspector i want you to arrest them immediately yes ma'am

626
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:41,800
did we do it did we arrest them we'll have to make sure we get to the ruins

627
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:46,119
before the pirates do i'm sure they won't leave much by the time they're done

628
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:52,920
they're going to go to the ruins with a class b digger's license you can get into the ruins in

629
02:00:52,920 --> 02:01:01,140
the cardan forest to the south and the ruins up north in the closer woods where the pirates are

630

634
02:01:39,779 --> 02:01:49,819
all right if they're using weapons like they did before the inspector might have some trouble

635
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:58,229
not to mention not to mention that the pirates are likely to steal everything if they get there first

636
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:06,869
well i think i better go help them be careful mega man i'll wait for you in the car we don't

the inspector is left to arrest the pirates i wanted to go too but it's just

640
02:02:48,779 --> 02:02:59,479
as important that someone stays to guard the mayor you why are you parked like this that's

she in the tree can you come back here is she in the suit roger i'll head back to city hall

753
02:34:39,379 --> 02:34:49,430
that doesn't sound like a radio that sounded like she was talking to a pillow

754
02:34:50,069 --> 02:34:57,850
or like through a wall if only we'd known there was someone like him here in the first place

755
02:34:57,850 --> 02:35:04,969
we won't fail next time we'll ambush concentrate our firepower on him we won't cut him any slack

756
02:35:04,969 --> 02:35:12,010
just because we outnumber him that kid's going down just wait till you see diesel i've got a new

757
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:17,930
robot i've been wanting to build that'll do the trick that'll teach him this time

758
02:35:17,930 --> 02:35:31,829
we get rid of blue boy for sure and get that treasure did they make a cartoon about this

759
02:35:33,750 --> 02:35:40,549
mega man good going you showed those pirates who's boss it looks like a screen name doesn't

760
02:35:40,549 --> 02:35:45,030
look like i'm mega man that looks like my screen name is mega man you've done so much for us

761
02:35:45,989 --> 02:35:51,700
i hope this will convince those pirates to give up i'm afraid to think what might happen if

762
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:57,590
they get their hands on the treasure the legends say a horrible disaster will occur if it's ever

763
02:35:57,590 --> 02:36:07,319
unearthed even if that's just a myth lately we've been detecting increased activity underground

764
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:15,719
the reaver bots are apparently activating of their own accord it has me concerned maybe there's

765
02:36:15,879 --> 02:36:19,399
talk about we gotta talk about the images about a horrible disaster let's talk about the images

766
02:36:20,379 --> 02:36:27,000
i wonder mega man would you be willing to explore the caves and dungeons on the island

767
02:36:28,090 --> 02:36:47,340
and see if you can find anything why why does it say no to this that's pretty good

768
02:36:49,590 --> 02:36:55,750
you will oh thank you so well this is back when video games had a no response to everything

769
02:36:56,709 --> 02:37:04,870
and it always was no you won't how could you say something like that will you and then you just say

770
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:08,309
yes right like they used to do this i don't know why why would what was the point of that

771
02:37:09,110 --> 02:37:14,040
old games did this all the time it was always they give you a yes or no question and then you

772
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:18,200
just said you would answer no and it would be like a one sentence joke and they would go back to yes

773
02:37:19,399 --> 02:37:30,629
only the best diggers are able to get a class a license the best of the best with that license

774
02:37:30,870 --> 02:37:36,469
you'll be able to get into the sealed off sites sealed off sites the ones those pirates have been

775
02:37:36,469 --> 02:37:43,450
trying to break into i give you my permission to dig in the island's sub gates just let me know if

776
02:37:43,450 --> 02:37:47,610
you find anything that can tell us about the treasure or that disaster that's supposed to

777
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:59,690
happen and i hate to mention this but if while you're digging you find anything of value it would

778
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:03,770
mean a lot to us if you could donate it to help with the restoration of the city

779
02:38:04,889 --> 02:38:17,530
thank you again be careful can somebody give me a health potion i am i was stubbed toe away from

780
02:38:17,530 --> 02:38:27,989
dying three different ways underground ruins called sub gates one is in the garden forest

781
02:38:27,989 --> 02:38:33,829
where we crashed another is in a lake in the uptown area which is to the west of the city and the last

782
02:38:33,829 --> 02:38:40,309
one is to the north in the closer woods which is where pirates just were i wonder which one you

783
02:38:40,309 --> 02:38:50,409
should check out first um we'll go to the crash site where we actually crashed oh i want a bank

784
02:38:50,409 --> 02:39:18,739
account too uh let's save save i smell a car joke um i mean that would have been bad it would have

785
02:39:18,739 --> 02:39:23,940
been funny for a sec but then i would have had to do the entire boss over again and i'm i'm not i

786
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:28,180
don't want to no that's that's too far back we got all the dialogue to go through the cut scenes

787
02:39:29,299 --> 02:39:38,569
no no no no not gonna happen all right talk to roll i have some equipment let me tell you about

02:39:48,250 --> 02:39:51,770
also it costs a little money but we can enhance your special weapons here

791
02:39:52,729 --> 02:39:57,049
is item development i might be able to make something new out of things you find

792
02:39:57,049 --> 02:40:03,979

826
02:47:40,469 --> 02:47:48,780

829
02:48:18,809 --> 02:48:24,059
i was looking for mushrooms on the other side of the passage when a tank rolled up out of nowhere

830
02:48:25,180 --> 02:48:33,139

836
02:49:32,020 --> 02:49:40,969
if you're in trouble use the car as a shield roll use the car as a shit was a payload

837
02:49:44,379 --> 02:50:09,879
all right we're almost out to this first checkpoint this i'll get too much damage

838
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:24,870
i want rapid fire i feel like it'd be more useful to me the cart has almost reached the final

839
02:50:45,110 --> 02:51:04,729
this thing moving got it get the hot points stupid this is a great game

840
02:51:06,809 --> 02:51:16,500
some would argue one of the best team fortress 2 is the simpsons of uh of the rainy shooters

841
02:51:16,500 --> 02:51:20,739
at this point there's a fence they everyone took food now they did it first everything

842
02:51:26,520 --> 02:51:47,430
payload they did it class-based shooter they did it opening boxes they did it oh we did it victory

843
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:19,399
new area it's a new zone oh this is an ice zone what will this watch over that item over there

846
02:52:33,590 --> 02:52:43,030

847
02:52:44,379 --> 02:52:50,549
is the refractor shielded most high level refractors are protected in some kind of shield

848
02:52:51,510 --> 02:52:55,510
you'll have to look for the control console and deactivate the shield

849
02:52:55,510 --> 02:53:05,209
thank you for the info hamster in my front pocket nothing it looks like the starter is missing

850
02:53:06,170 --> 02:53:09,610
it's probably hidden somewhere nearby you'll have to find it

851
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:19,299
remember there might be more than one starter key too more than one key all right we're gonna

852
02:53:19,299 --> 02:53:28,489
activate the refractor they got super powered super charged up fighting abilities

853
02:53:29,850 --> 02:53:36,809

1101
03:57:48,579 --> 03:57:52,979
kim and i made macaroni and cheese one night in quotes from scratch right we didn't get out of

1102
03:57:52,979 --> 03:58:00,979
a box we got a bunch of velveta we got some other cheeses we got elbow macaroni and we got some

1103
03:58:00,979 --> 03:58:04,260
spices we're gonna make it was like a little date let's make our own mac and cheese great

1104
03:58:05,379 --> 03:58:11,799
and you guys don't know about velveta i'm that's gonna kill me well it will if you eat too much

1105
03:58:11,799 --> 03:58:20,500
but i'm talking about the game um velveta is so heavy and so thick that when you're hungry

1106
03:58:20,500 --> 03:58:25,370
and you make macaroni and cheese with velveta you always are like you know what fuck it let's

1107
03:58:25,370 --> 03:58:34,489
put half the brick in yeah yep that's what i want to do don't do that don't put in oh my god

1111
04:00:39,610 --> 04:00:50,649
fucking crazy all right the cheese right so if you use more than a half a brick of velveta

1112
04:00:50,649 --> 04:00:58,170
it's really tempting because you just plump it in there and it's melts but that shit turns

1113
04:00:59,049 --> 04:01:08,649
into cement wait and when you start to mix it up and it starts to lose some of its liquid content

1114
04:01:09,770 --> 04:01:16,889
it turns into this thick cement like substance it's it's crazy how just too much it is

you're a psycho i saw at least 10 people say yes

1141
04:08:01,079 --> 04:08:29,159
those are all germa alt accounts they got me it's my posture i'm like i have to have my posture has

1142
04:08:29,159 --> 04:08:37,559
to be fixed i have this right there i have a brace on that means no i was already up there

1143
04:08:38,520 --> 04:08:46,489
and definitely i'm wearing a brace that makes it so i can't now i'm lost in here

1144
04:08:49,129 --> 04:09:09,030
it wasn't this way this is i gotta get out of this over here uh yeah the brace that i'm wearing

1145
04:09:09,030 --> 04:09:15,030
it means i can't physically put my shoulders forward i can't it'll be tension on my back and

1146
04:09:15,030 --> 04:09:16,069
chest and stuff and stomach

1147
04:09:20,790 --> 04:09:23,270
and it also puts a little bit of pressure underneath my rib cage which

1148
04:09:24,170 --> 04:09:41,059
makes me feel a bit better roller board you're just strapped into your boomer seat

1149
04:09:50,969 --> 04:09:58,569
so we can go we went this way let's pack it back up and go up let's go

1150
04:10:00,340 --> 04:10:07,860
all right so when i did this because remember i this my ps2 is going through a capture card

1151
04:10:07,860 --> 04:10:14,340
which is then upscaling it to 1080p right i have a device that does that for that operation to

1152
04:10:14,340 --> 04:10:22,010
happen it takes about one full second so i just got terrified because on my left monitor there's

1153
04:10:22,010 --> 04:10:25,690
a small pre there's a preview window over here at the stream so when i went like this

1154
04:10:26,250 --> 04:10:30,569
i almost two full seconds later i thought my other monitor blue screen

1155
04:10:31,450 --> 04:10:34,489
i was like what the fuck is going on it was very very scary

1156
04:10:37,610 --> 04:10:48,120
that happens a lot that shit happens all the time

1157
04:10:48,120 --> 04:10:51,620
especially when i'm playing uh an old console that has to go through the capture cards

1158
04:10:52,500 --> 04:10:55,860
so

1159
04:10:59,219 --> 04:11:05,770

1378
05:10:27,029 --> 05:10:36,869

1379
05:10:36,869 --> 05:10:43,319
if i had a big refractor like yours i could probably fix it hold on i gotta call my sister

1447
05:36:29,880 --> 05:36:37,130
going to be a place to put image links so i can easily have them captured already and be able to

1448
05:36:37,130 --> 05:36:44,169
cut to them immediately so they don't have to be in the chat it's going to be it's going to be

1457
05:38:21,909 --> 05:38:25,830
and i like energy too though just because i like getting more out i feel like it's kind of hard

1458
05:38:25,830 --> 05:38:29,270
sometimes with some of the enemies to get more than two or three shots off before having to move

1459
05:38:35,340 --> 05:38:38,619
oh happy birthday yeah i didn't why did i say happy birthday what am i crazy

1460
05:38:39,740 --> 05:39:01,450
high energy and rapid is fun yeah we'll see what i end up with just old hover jets i have a board

1461
05:39:02,009 --> 05:39:16,759
and i have jets you know what that means hover board incoming go up where it's gonna go just up

1462
05:39:17,400 --> 05:39:28,060
yeah where we going we don't need roads i hate these guys i also i don't actually don't really

1463
05:39:28,060 --> 05:39:34,060
like this canon thing that much i really i don't i think i want to change it it's a little too slow

1464
05:39:34,060 --> 05:40:03,080
and it's uh it's all right the power plus mode back on i like the range vacuum maybe we'll just

1465
05:40:03,080 --> 05:40:14,459
does it cost energy to use it no it doesn't all right maybe i'll try it

1466
05:40:15,180 --> 05:40:29,290
and upgrade it pretty cheap too all right so remind me to look at the vacuum when i get out

1467
05:40:29,290 --> 05:40:35,419
of the game but when i get it into the boat it's a car whatever the thing is it holds

1468
05:40:37,689 --> 05:40:41,529
you were that was deceiving you were in a different spot than i thought you were

1601
06:12:26,459 --> 06:12:34,599
sick um it depends on how you stuffed up i always like to put a couple of pillows underneath my

1602
06:12:34,599 --> 06:12:39,880
head and shoulders because then when you lie back if you have a stuffy nose and a sore throat

1603
06:12:40,759 --> 06:12:50,119
it it starts closing you up so sit making lying down and having your head propped up a little bit

1604
06:12:50,119 --> 06:12:54,439
help uh somebody said humidifier that was like the next thing i was gonna say was uh

1605
06:12:54,439 --> 06:13:07,540
humidifier potentially and don't don't abuse it because it's really not great for you

1606
06:13:08,180 --> 06:13:12,500
but if it's really if you know to open you up a little bit and make you go to sleep the stuff

1607
06:13:12,500 --> 06:13:21,340
like nyquil is is in very very small moderation is good i think make sure you stay make sure you

1608
06:13:21,340 --> 06:13:38,700
can play in water one of the things about nyquil is nyquil uh uh has a cedaminophen in it and it's

1609
06:13:38,700 --> 06:13:42,299
i got a full dose of a cedaminophen and people just go oh i'm just gonna drink some more nyquil

1610
06:13:42,299 --> 06:13:47,020
have like double triple the dose you're taking like a two to three times a dose of cedaminophen

1611
06:13:47,020 --> 06:13:50,220
that you should be taking and it's really not good for you at all it's actually very bad for

1612
06:13:50,220 --> 06:14:06,310
you so you shouldn't be doing that it's really really bad for your liver it can make you pretty

1613
06:14:06,310 --> 06:14:13,610
it can actually make you sick really sick you take too much cedaminophen in one day more than

1614
06:14:13,610 --> 06:14:24,939
the recommended amount actually you can get actually very sick all right let's go where

1777
06:57:14,759 --> 06:57:18,200
this island just got so many mysteries i just don't know where to start looking

1778
06:57:19,159 --> 06:57:26,459
it have you ever heard of the main gate yes yes i said oh you have hey and you probably already

1779
06:57:26,459 --> 06:57:32,299
know this but the largest ruin on the island it's called the main gate and can be found near the old

1780
06:57:32,299 --> 06:57:39,939
city what's unusual about it is as far as anyone knows there's no way to get inside i have a theory

1781
06:57:39,939 --> 06:57:46,659
that's connected to some it's connected in some way with the sub gates tell me mega man you found

1782
06:57:46,659 --> 06:57:53,060
a passage in the sub gate that connects to the main gate no if i'm right sub gate in the closer

1783
06:57:53,060 --> 06:57:57,939
woods there's some kind of key for the main gate and i'm willing to bet anything it's treasuring

1784
06:57:57,939 --> 06:58:03,259
those pirates a little after it's inside the main gate they probably realized how close and they are

1785
06:58:03,259 --> 06:58:12,470
and the treasurer don't let your guard down thank you elderly fuck hey all right time the person up

07:24:35,450 --> 07:24:43,750
target sensor front clips front clips are superior well front clips are actually harder

1887
07:24:43,750 --> 07:25:07,430
to do i think than backflips in some regard i definitely can't do it anymore and i really hope

1888
07:25:07,430 --> 07:25:13,189
that there's some recording of me doing it but i used to actually be able to do a full backflip

1889
07:25:13,189 --> 07:25:18,779
from standing on the ground i could not do a front flip though no matter how hard i tried i could

1890
07:25:18,779 --> 07:25:35,189
never do it front flips always were impossible for me can i get out of here from this i think

1891
07:25:35,189 --> 07:25:49,139
i can right if i go this way ancient book well that's cool nice

1892
07:25:51,619 --> 07:26:13,479

07:29:01,959 --> 07:29:23,990
yeah i i do actually i'm back all right roll come here what is that reaction

1906
07:29:25,509 --> 07:29:51,880
yes i do yes i do okay let's make him make an item he's probably painfully aware of how much

1907
07:29:51,880 --> 07:30:07,430
he pays active buster fires a homing missile that will track the nearest enemy okay so homing

1908
07:30:08,150 --> 07:30:13,880
still a lot of enhancements that could make i'm enhancing this one i'm gonna spend a ton of money

1909
07:30:13,880 --> 07:30:32,220
on it buster sniper scope it increases your firing range as far as it will go so i max out

1910
07:30:32,220 --> 07:30:39,340
my range hold on let's take a look i keep the grand grenade on though i feel like i need it

1911
07:30:39,340 --> 07:31:03,509
if there's a level arm machine buster uh what should i put on maybe the machine buster i want

1912
07:31:03,509 --> 07:31:20,099
to try it for active buster powered buster grenade arm vacuum arm active buster it's

1913
07:31:20,099 --> 07:31:33,189
an answer active buster attack it's also expensive homing capability i have a lot of money but do i

1914
07:31:33,189 --> 07:31:56,939
want to spend it on here upgrades its homing capability let's go i want it more spiring speed

1915
07:32:01,049 --> 07:32:34,169
more range that's 20 000 dollars um ammo i think better be good talk to data energy charge okay

1916
07:32:34,169 --> 07:33:11,060
save again this is a boss wrecker cool go back in uh we want to talk to roll this is my first time

2003
07:52:31,909 --> 07:52:37,509
and it kept your character in the cabinet and you'd get these guys that would come in and just

2004
07:52:37,509 --> 07:52:45,049
load up eight bucks worth of coins log into their character and they'd be level 99 and they would

2046
07:59:21,319 --> 07:59:26,439
had a lot of fun this game is really fun it's challenging but it's also still very accessible

2047
07:59:27,080 --> 07:59:33,720
it's not too hard it's fun it's not that it's hard it's just fun to play with items and

2048
07:59:34,279 --> 07:59:44,169
find stuff talk to people don't imagine donating to a millionaire i don't have a million dollars

2049
07:59:44,169 --> 07:59:47,610
i just want to make that real clear yeah i don't have them i don't have that much money

2050
07:59:49,750 --> 07:59:55,029
it'd be cool if i had a million dollars of your fund i would use it to buy i would buy i would

2051
07:59:55,029 --> 08:00:03,580
buy a house in cash imagine i don't have a billion dollars i don't happen to have

2052
08:00:03,580 --> 08:00:12,569
close to a billion dollars i don't even have close to i don't even have close to ten percent

2053
08:00:12,569 --> 08:00:16,950
of a million dollars right now not even close i don't even have close to 20% of a million

2054
08:00:16,950 --> 08:00:33,209
dollars right now i'm close half a million i don't look at those calculators they don't make any

2055
08:00:33,209 --> 08:00:36,970
sense one of those calculators said i was worth like eight billion dollars and that's not even

2056
08:00:36,970 --> 08:00:48,299
true is that even a visit a virus website what is this

2057
08:00:48,299 --> 08:00:52,939
germa's night second germa is smile my second germa account is worth

2058
08:00:52,939 --> 08:00:57,220
three hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars

2059
08:00:57,220 --> 08:01:09,290
so that's what it would be worth if i sold that channel

2060
08:01:09,290 --> 08:01:22,020
how much money does the second germa make

2061
08:01:22,020 --> 08:01:27,099
no that social blade yo and this here's the dumb thing about social blade

2062
08:01:27,099 --> 08:01:31,419
social blade likes to do this fun thing where they're not possible to be wrong

2063
08:01:31,419 --> 08:01:38,459
germa 95 is worth thirty eight thousand to twelve million like oh okay that's

2064
08:01:38,459 --> 08:01:49,619
quite a window but what about the what about the main

2065
08:01:49,619 --> 08:01:55,080

2173
08:13:10,709 --> 08:13:13,430
brother has been making fun of me relentlessly

2174
08:13:13,430 --> 08:13:17,110
all day today that my favorite streamer doesn't wash his hands

2175
08:13:17,110 --> 08:13:21,750
after using the toilet he said the origins of your name is probably not

2176
08:13:21,750 --> 08:13:24,569
related but he also said that you did not deny

2177
08:13:24,569 --> 08:13:27,930
not washing your hands after touching the toilet handle and your

2178
08:13:27,930 --> 08:13:31,770
privates please tell him the truth otherwise i'll have to suplex my brother

2179
08:13:31,770 --> 08:13:39,560
to the next dimension and i'm half his weight what i

2180
08:13:39,560 --> 08:13:43,770
yes i wash my hands after going to the bathroom

2181
08:13:43,770 --> 08:13:46,889
in fact let me go over this with some of you guys

2182
08:13:46,889 --> 08:13:50,330
um i pre-wash before going to the bathroom

2183
08:13:50,330 --> 08:13:54,389
you get people going into the bathroom i'm just talking like

2184
08:13:54,389 --> 08:14:02,139
going to the urinal and they just pull up down their pants and pee

2185
08:14:02,139 --> 08:14:05,959
and like grab their you know private and pee

2186
08:14:05,959 --> 08:14:10,939
without washing their hands first so that's

2187
08:14:10,939 --> 08:14:14,060
all the stuff that you've been touching throughout the course of that day why

2188
08:14:14,060 --> 08:14:19,909
not wash your hands first before you touch your bear you know

2189
08:14:20,919 --> 08:14:25,099
and then wash again there's a pre-wash to get the germs off your hands before

2190
08:14:25,099 --> 08:14:29,590
you touch your and then there's a sec second wash after

2191
08:14:29,590 --> 08:14:39,349
you're done think about that imagine like grabbing

2192
08:14:39,349 --> 08:14:42,630
like the door handle to even the like pushing the bathroom door open that's

2193
08:14:42,630 --> 08:14:47,189
been touched 500 million times and probably cleaned once a week and

2194
08:14:47,189 --> 08:14:57,639
then you grab your penis i just spit everywhere but i'm

2195
08:14:57,639 --> 08:15:06,650
being dead serious can you imagine not doing a small pre-wash

2196
08:15:06,810 --> 08:15:10,009
a pre-wash is not the same as post wash a pre-wash

2197
08:15:10,009 --> 08:15:14,250
is just a little bit of soap and just a little bit under the water

2198
08:15:14,250 --> 08:15:17,619
just a little and then the post wash is a little bit is to

2199
08:15:17,619 --> 08:15:23,189
really clean it up i don't know how this is such a strange concept to some of you

2200
08:15:23,189 --> 08:15:33,000
guys say a pre-washing your hands before you

2201
08:15:33,000 --> 08:15:45,700
touch down there is apparently weird do you pre-wash before a shower

2202
08:15:45,700 --> 08:15:49,779
when i'm taking what do you what the shower is the wash

2203
08:15:49,779 --> 08:15:52,659
the pre-wash of your hands before touching your

2204
08:15:52,659 --> 08:15:57,939
penis is because that's saying that word people are gonna fucking clip this and

2205
08:15:57,939 --> 08:16:03,779
take it and put it somewhere um before i go in the shower guys i

2206
08:16:03,779 --> 08:16:09,900
don't like just start grabbing and like what you know what that's a good idea

2207
08:16:09,900 --> 08:16:13,340
right now before i get in the shower i'm just gonna like mush my hands down

2208
08:16:13,340 --> 08:16:19,610
here and what are you talking about so you

2209
08:16:19,610 --> 08:16:22,490
open the door or open the curtain to the shower and you

2210
08:16:22,490 --> 08:16:31,529
get it and turn the water on next time you go to the doctor

2211
08:16:31,529 --> 08:16:34,569
i'm say i'm next time you go to the doctor listen to me next time you go to

2212
08:16:34,569 --> 08:16:38,569
the doctor i want you to ask the doctor say hey um

2213
08:16:38,569 --> 08:16:43,060
as a medical professional do you think it's a good idea

2214
08:16:43,060 --> 08:16:47,700
to wash your hands before you pee into a urinal

2215
08:16:47,700 --> 08:16:51,459
and i'll bet you the doctor is gonna go yeah that sounds like a good way to

2216
08:16:51,459 --> 08:16:53,779
avoid getting sick and germs and touching

2217
08:16:53,779 --> 08:16:57,619
touching your dick with your hands that you've been grabbing all over stuff and

2218
08:16:57,619 --> 08:17:00,659
grabbing it on escalator rails and then you pee

2219
08:17:00,659 --> 08:17:10,439
actually yeah i think that's a good idea that's what would happen anyways thanks

2220
08:17:10,439 --> 08:17:13,450
for the uh thanks for the 250 i wash my hands

2221

germa funny thing happened the other week i was turning into a small artist

2367
08:30:41,290 --> 08:30:44,970
art stream and i used your sub emotes in her chat

2368
08:30:44,970 --> 08:30:48,650
and out of the five total viewers three of them were germa fans who have

2369
08:30:48,650 --> 08:30:56,759
recognized the emote we chatted heaps about you in your past

2370
08:30:56,759 --> 08:31:01,560
videos and we made song requests to the art streamer to listen to germa's songs

2371
08:31:01,560 --> 08:31:05,689
such as the berries song and the marching band song

2372
08:31:05,689 --> 08:31:09,209
additionally we also watched both rat movies on stream

2373
08:31:09,209 --> 08:31:26,490
she was confused but enjoyed them that would be pretty confusing man

2374
08:31:26,490 --> 08:31:30,090
jokes about having an avocado for a penis and makes ten thousand dollars a

2375
08:31:30,090 --> 08:31:49,700
month federal agents hate him i will tell you though all right

2376
08:31:49,700 --> 08:31:54,419
