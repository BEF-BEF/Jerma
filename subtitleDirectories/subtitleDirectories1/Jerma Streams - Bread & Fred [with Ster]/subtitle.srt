1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:19,609
Bread and Fred. Bread and Fred. I'm turn your volume down. I'm glad I did because the splash

2
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:28,100
screen is very loud. Yep. Oh, yeah. Turn your volume down. I'm glad I caught that. It is very

3
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:52,920
loud. Uh, should I play this with a controller? Jesus. What the fuck? I'm trying to turn it down

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:08,459
and it went up. What just happened? Hold on a second. Why? Hey, I got, I got a limiter on

5
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,930
everything that comes through. Don't worry. I have a limiter on everything that comes through now.

6
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:20,920
So that was loud, but that wasn't unbelievably loud. Don't worry. I put it on there. All right.

7
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:30,099
How you feel? Hey, how you doing there? Hey, pal. What's going on there, pal? Hold on. What do you,

8
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:36,170
what resolution are you playing at? What do you, what do you, what? Hey, what resolution,

9
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:45,030
what resolution are we playing at? Yes. You can do five. What is 5120 by 2160? What the hell is

10
00:01:45,030 --> 00:02:15,830
that? A projector? 5K resolution. All right. Let me capture this. Hey, there it is. Okay. This game

11
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:22,039
is Torturous Chat. Uh, it's a co-op platformer where we're tied together. I don't, I haven't

12
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,879
played it. Haven't seen it played, but I know that it is going to require coordination between

13
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:33,210
me and you to succeed. So it is going to be torture. Okay. So how do we get in a game together?

14
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,240
You click play and then it says multiplayer. Okay. Should I, do you want to host? Do you want me to

15
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,960
host it? Uh, I'll, I'll host again. Make sure there's not like a room code before we, we show it.

16
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:54,300
My screen is hidden. There's no room code. It's a steam invite. I've sent you the steam invite.

17
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,250
I have. Ooh. All right. Are we good? There's no like, oh, there we go.

18
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:11,620
Waiting for your partner. Yeah. You got to press space to confirm for some reason. Oh, so okay.

19
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:18,780
I'm Fred. You're Fred. I'm bread. Is a mod here? Can they change the game to Fred and Fred? Hey,

20
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:28,699
can that mod come over to my channel and do the same? Don't do that. Okay. So how does it work?

21
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:35,259
I'm going to plug a controller in for sure. Okay. So I'm the red one and how do you move?

22
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:48,259
WASD is working for me. It's, it's arrow keys for me. Oh, numpad with your, with your coffee.

23
00:03:48,259 --> 00:04:09,509
I'm using controller. Uh, do you know what a fulcrum is? Yes. Oh, you played Q. Why is WASD not

24
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:16,230
working? And I, this controller not work either for this game. Everything's fine for me. What the

25
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:23,850
heck? Um, that's weird. Uh, I guess I'm doing arrow keys. Is it that hard? No, it's not that

26
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:33,029
difficult. It's fine. Okay. Oh, our ping is at the top. It's funny. So let's just jump and walk.

27
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:43,610
Is there any other buttons? Not that I've noticed. I don't know what this is. I think this is where

28
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,230
you get your collectibles or something. Oh, we got it. We got to go climb the mountain. How did

29
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:55,029
you just do that? Do what? You were like holding on because we're always holding on. All right.

30
00:04:55,029 --> 00:05:01,339
Well, get up here. We have to time this by the way. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. This is going

31
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:07,819
to be torture. How do you, from, from there, can I like pull you up? It doesn't, it does not appear.

32
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:15,269
So, okay. So what? No, no, no, don't just do that. Are we going to, are we going to have to count

33
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:22,949
down for every jump? Yes. So that's how it works. Ready? Do you want to go like, go or do you want

34
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:30,069
it to be like one, two, three? How do you want to do this? Uh, uno, dos, tres. Okay. So you want,

35
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:41,220
we have to get the same thing. Ready? Uno, dos, tres. On three. Oh, I can swing. Uno, dos, tres.

36
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,269
Uno, dos, tres. Only one of us. Okay. Only one of us should do it. We need something better than

37
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:58,230
that. I'm telling you. I, I say what we're going to do is now jump and on jump. No, no, no, no, no,

38
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,870
no, no, no. No, cause if you do one, two, three, then you're adding 33% more gameplay time.

39
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:16,339
Yeah. But if we, if we, if it just simply just is now jump, now jump, see now jump. Can I swing

40
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:27,579
you up here? Maybe. All right. Just one, two, three. No comedy dog shit. One, two, three. One, two,

41
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:38,100
three. One, two, three. Oh, it's Charlie. Review some of the key points. The most important one is

42
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:45,459
swinging. One of you needs to be an anchor. That doesn't even work for me because it's down.

43
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:58,069
And then you swing. Okay. Okay. Don't fall. Okay. So let's go up here. Let's test that out. So I'm

44
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:04,629
going to, I'll come over here. One, two, three. So I'm going to anchor and then you go down.

45
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:14,279
What happens if I do that? So you can swing and get yourself up here. I think at some point,

46
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Oh, if I let go, you need to stand up and then we need to both. We're not getting past like the

47
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:34,060
first jump. There's no way in this room. Okay. Coffee anchor. All right. Okay. Now we need,

48
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:42,660
we need to both jump here. All right. One, two, three. One, two, three. Okay. Here's here. You're,

49
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:50,839
I'm going to anchor. You're going to swing. And then when you're coming back. Okay. Wait, wait,

50
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:05,750
Hey, I'm going to go for it. Okay. Apparently you need to go more up. One, two, three. One, two,

51
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:12,540
three. Okay. I'm anchoring now. So you want me, when you go up there, I jump when I'm swinging

52
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:23,259
like that. All right. You just kind of, I'm going to anchor and you find yourself. I can't,

53
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,579
I can't hear. I've got to move. No, German come down. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

54
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,939
We can watch, make this jump without an anchor. We have to practice the anchor. Cause it's going

55
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:41,190
to be, there's going to be a jump up here. We're going to lose. It's one, two. What are you doing?

56
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:47,190
Don't kind of like, all right. One, two, three. You have to keep the same timing the whole time.

57
00:08:47,190 --> 00:09:01,940
One, two, three. Yeah. Can you, no, I can kind of like pull you. Oh, you have to make the jump.

58
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:16,179
Okay. You need to swing more than that. So bad at this. We need to count. You don't just sense me.

59
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:25,460
We're not like close enough that we can just sense. One, two, three. One, two, three. Anchor.

60
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:37,580
Go for it. I'll do the jump. Okay. Um, what, what, what? I don't know. What? Just swing. I can't.

61
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,960
Why do my forehead get so much bigger? I don't know. Did we break it that? All right. All right.

62
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:54,179
All right. No, no, no. So now if you swing, you can, oh, there we go. All right. One, two, three.

63
00:09:54,259 --> 00:10:02,149
One, two, three. Don't just jump without counting. Well, I'm getting anchored. We don't need the,

64
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:11,610
I got you. Okay. And you can pull me up. Okay. Ready? One, two, three. One, two, three. All right.

65
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,669
You just have to be ready to do the jump. I'm not good at this yet. There you go. All right. Stop.

66
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:21,980
No, don't, don't freak out because we have to get through the tutorial. Okay. That's our child.

67
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:30,710
Ready? How do we get up there? I think we have to just jump. Okay. One, two, three. Oh, yeah. All

68
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,659
right. We got it. We're getting there. What a challenge you're undertaking. Enjoy the trip.

69
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:46,789
They aren't coming back. I don't, that's ominous. I don't know why. Wait, don't just jump. I know

70
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:58,360
you're like a fast gamer. You like to go really quickly, but we can't do that here. One, two,

71
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:08,389
three. It's funny. All right. One, two, three. One, two, three. All right. That's wait, wait,

72
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:16,460
hold on. We need the momentum and the jump. That's a lot. That's a big gap. There's a countdown

73
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:28,600
button. What is it? I'm going to the options. You are controlling my video game right now. Am I?

74
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:45,399
Yeah. I don't, I don't have. Don't, dude, are you going to go like change my resolution? I got clap.

75
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:58,460
We got clap. We got pull the rope with jump grab. I don't think I can do that by the way. Rock,

76
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:04,440
paper, scissors. Well, this is yours. This is player two. Yeah, but I wait. Now I can do WASD.

77
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:12,279
That's weird because I, because this is weird. This is weird. This is like a hamachi gameplay.

78
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:19,000
Like we're on a land, but not really. Uh, so look at your controls. Grab is control. Grab is E for

79
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:33,259
me. Four is no down. Wait, I think what it's saying now is you this countdown is four, but you wait.

80
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:43,110
All right. Get out of this menu for a second. I WAC does not work. Okay. Hold on. But can I do

81
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:50,200
that though? I cannot do a countdown. If I go, I can't even hit escape, dude. I literally have no

82
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:58,940
control of my own game. You're okay. So this is really weird. Go. Can you go to my setting? Your

83
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:09,450
countdown is num lock four. What the fuck? Okay. So that's hard to do though. How come I can't just

84
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:16,120
have the same controls as you? I don't know. Why can't we just say it out loud? All right. Let's

85
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,889
go. Ready? Okay. I think you need to move over. Maybe you want me to anger. No, no, no less

86
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:30,659
because, because if I swing, then I, what I'm saying is when you're that close, I just end up

87
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:38,220
standing. I know. But wait, you all right. You ready? That's not going to help me. Okay. Wait,

88
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:49,139
wait. Let me, let me do the other direction. Let me get that. Okay. Ready? No, no. Are you all right?

89
00:13:49,139 --> 00:14:02,220
Oh shit. I killed him. Okay. Can I, can you hit escape for me? Cause I don't know what, how to

90
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:11,340
get to my menu. I now go to your menu. Now go to like controls. Now go to me, like Fred player two

91
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:27,080
select like my tab at the top. I did control, grab objects, save checkpoint, pull rope is shift

92
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,059
countdown is four. That's not what it's going to be. Be like, it's the N four is num lock. Yeah.

93
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:43,990
No, no, no, no, no. This is being changed. Uh, this is going to be press game pad. Can it be right

94
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:56,470
control? Wait, there is a gigantic game pad at the top. Oh, thank God. Oh yes. Okay. Left, right,

95
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:05,190
jump anchor. Grab his left trigger, left bumper, pull rope is B. All right, let's go. You can,

96
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:24,179
you can get me out of here now. It didn't, it doesn't, it didn't do anything. Do I have to

97
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:33,029
select it for you? I don't know. Press left on the D pad. It's weirdly enough. I don't have any

98
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:39,379
control of any of this. Now I do. Like I can control this now. So if I go to Fred player two,

99
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:46,179
it says game pad. Yes. Is there like a yes button? Like an accept button? No, I think what chat is

100
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:52,759
an understanding is when I go into the options, it is changing what your options are. Yeah.

101
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,919
And we're on the internet. This is okay. I select game pad. I have to connect a controller,

102
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,440
but it works for him, but I don't have a controller connected. Okay, but hold on a second.

103
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:09,299
We can't have the same inputs on keyboard. So this is working for me. I'm using my controller

104
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:18,299
right now. So if I hit back, back, back, I have no control anymore and it doesn't work. And now I

105
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:25,159
have no control. I can't do it. I'm just going to use the fucking, wait, nothing works now.

106
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:39,690
Click that. So we had another backup game. No, this is fun. This is really fun. All right. Should

107
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:52,389
we restart the game? I don't know if that's going to help. All right. Just get us out of this.

108
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:58,470
Like this. Can you like jump off or something and pull us down? Exit to main menu. All right. Now,

109
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,629
wait, can you set up your options before we play? Okay. Set up your options before we do anything.

110
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:11,750
I have access. I can use my controller options, controls, game pad. I'm player two.

111
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:21,099
This is, it works. It's working right now. This works right now. Okay. Okay. I, I let's just check

112
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:28,789
it again. I'm going to put them both on the game pad. No, wait, would that fuck up for you? Okay.

113
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:43,859
If I'm Fred, no idea. I mean, it works right now. All right. So invite me. Yeah. My chat's saying

114
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:52,460
you can't play on a game pad. You would just have to use different keyboard controls. Okay. Well,

115
00:17:52,539 --> 00:18:00,059
then we're just going to have to do that. I'm fine with, with the arrow keys. You either both

116
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:04,630
have to be keyboard or both game pad. You can't mix it. So do you have a game pad? I don't know

117
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:16,519
where it is. Let's just go. We were doing fine. That's bizarre. Okay. Uh, I'm ready for an invite.

118
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:25,990
You want an invite? I, I sent it and now I can't. I'm so confused. The whole premise of this game

119
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:45,700
is co-op and it doesn't. Okay. You're bread. I'm Fred. Okay. Are we good? Are we? You can move.

120
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,859
I can move. You know what your grab button is? Cause it looks like grabbing walls is also

121
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:58,410
grab this control for me. I believe. Okay. Is that the wall? Maybe not. Is it number,

122
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:04,220
the number pad control that's up there? Hold on. Can you go look at my controls?

123
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:18,140
Okay. Hold on. Red two. You just do it. It's weird because when I'm looking at Fred two,

124
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:24,140
it switches the controls for you. No, that's gotta be left control. I can change it for you.

125
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:33,420
I can do it too. Grab object. I want it to be shift, pull rope, right shift. What on earth?

126
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:48,140
No, like Z clap two. Um, I'm going to do two here. Three comes up one countdown X interact E. Okay.

127
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:56,809
I think that should be fine. I get us out of here. Okay. All right. I can grab. We're good. Okay.

128
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:14,940
We're good. We're good. Ready? Yes. Actually very helpful. Three, two, one. You gotta pull with up

129
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:26,410
jump. Yeah. There we go. Okay. Wow. Look at that synchronicity. Okay. So you, we can try this again.

130
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:32,140
Ready? All right. We're going to slingshot over there to the wall. You might have to grab it.

131
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:45,900
I'm going to try to grab. Hey, you ready? I'm going on the next one. Got it up. Jump, jump. Yeah.

132
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,019
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we do here. Probably double jump. I think it's showing us arrows up

133
00:20:52,019 --> 00:21:01,930
there. Why? Oh, I just jumped. There we go. Okay. We just, we just wait, wait, wait, wait.

134
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:21,240
What the heck? That was, that baited us. Trying to teach us something. See, you know, I'm just

135
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:34,680
going on that. Okay. You ready? I'm ready. Going on the next one. Wow. Can you do anything about this?

136
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:46,890
Can you like worms your way up there? You're going to, you're dying. You gotta let go. You gotta let

137
00:21:46,890 --> 00:22:06,630
go. This is as far as we get, huh? We made it already. Okay. Ready? I'm going on. Wait,

138
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:23,940
hold on. I'm going too far. Hey, I'm going on the next one. Up, up. All right. Sorry guys. My bad.

139
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:38,339
Okay. So, okay. So what, what's the deal here? You, you, it shows us in the picture. So grab,

140
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:44,920
one of us, do you want to grab it or do you want me to do it? Uh, I'm going to grab. No, you,

141
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,640
why would, I don't know. You freaked me out. You did the one, two, three, go. One, two, three,

142
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,480
go means we go. I don't think I could jump and reach the wall unless we both jumped up. I don't

143
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,960
know why you jumped forward. I saw the one, two, three, and I'm like, I have to go. He's doing it.

144
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:08,980
I'm going to be very clear. I'm going to be very deliberate. I'm going to give

145
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:21,130
hand written instructions. I'm going on this one. You can do it for sure. Just get enough momentum.

146
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:36,900
Brother. Oh brother. You can't, you just gotta stand. You gotta stay up there and you keep doing

147
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,930
your little joke. Pull me up. What do you mean my little joke? We don't even need the timing for

148
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:52,950
that one. All right. It's actually kind of hard to do this. You ready? So when you get the momentum,

149
00:23:52,950 --> 00:24:01,460
you do the jump. You're not getting a lot of it. You jumped at the wrong time. You're not getting

150
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:08,779
momentum like I get momentum. You're, you're a dead weight. I had plenty of momentum. You're not,

151
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:15,960
you're an anchor. Look at, there's not much more momentum I can give you.

152
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,000
You weren't doing that before. You see how you can't get up there unless I jump with you.

153
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:42,569
So give me a countdown. Let's go. Why are you trying to mess me up? I'm connected to you.

154
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:59,700
You're the anchor. Yes. Next one. Nice. Okay. All right. So what I'm saying here is we need

155
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:06,920
to both jump straight up at the same time. Then you grab the wall. I, and then we grab the wall.

156
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:20,039
Yes. Okay. We're jumping up, not forward. Yes. I know I'm hitting it. We gotta, you gotta,

157
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:35,859
you gotta let go. Yeah. You gotta get higher. Okay. Look at us. There we go. Look at that.

158
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,619
Look at that. All right. Are we going for the right or are we going up here?

159
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:52,519
We're going to jump to the right. Got it. Men. Now what? The same thing on this left wall.

160
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:59,700
You're going to grab the left wall. Yep. And then I'm going to swing up. You're going to grab it.

161
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:08,500
I just, I just pressed the button. It must've been a lag. It's just a bad program.

162
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:16,380
Okay. All right. How are you? Are you sweating? I'm, oh, that was fun. What's the next game?

163
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,470
Oh, you're not pulling out. You're not pulling out right now. You're not pulling out right now.

164
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:36,660
You ready? Okay. This is just Jump King with two people. Yeah. I never even played Jump King.

165
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,660
Don't, you'll, you'll be very upset at yourself for like a week. But we're doing that,

166
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:57,799
but worse. Um, we're at forty. Three, two, one. All right. Am I anchoring? Yeah. Okay. I'm going

167
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:06,809
to wait a second here because this is important. We make this. Yeah. Just do that. Ready? Got it.

168
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:21,640
Great. Achievement up here. Oh, look at that cute little baby. Our baby. Oh, we had together. Oh,

169
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:31,160
okay. You see what's going on here. Okay. I do, but I don't. You're grabbing. I need to grab.

170
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,009
All right. Or do you want me to grab? No, I'll grab. I'll grab. It better not be a lag.

171
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:49,980
Can you grab? I'm going to try. Okay. Give me the timer. Okay. Let go. What? Wait,

172
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:55,049
that makes logical. That does make logical sense. I think you need to, as you're doing it,

173
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,809
you need to grab, you need to grab that side. I need to grab on the other side.

174
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:07,299
We're not in a bad position. It's just, it's stressful because there's a timer of how long

175
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:18,069
you can hold on. Wait a second. This is a different route. Okay. If we mess this up,

176
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:23,269
we have to do everything again. I know. And I know you hate this. You hate more than anything,

177
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:29,099
like having to do the thing over again, which is why you never play these games up,

178
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:34,900
up. You always anchor up. I need to anchor. Otherwise we'll fall. No, you pull up and then

179
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:40,200
I pull, I pull up, I pull, you pull up, you're down. That was a weird, you, that was weird.

180
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:47,690
What you just did. Hold on. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Now wait a minute. I'm going to grab the

181
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,690
first one and then you're going to swing up to the wall on the other side and grab it.

182
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,650
And then you're going to swing and we're going to swing over there. Yes. You got it.

183
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:18,230
Oh, I'm good. Ready? A little more, a little more, a little more. More. Okay. Ready? On this one,

184
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:24,089
on this one. Oh, we had it. Okay. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it.

185
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:42,250
We got it. We got it. We got it. We can do it. What the fuck? I was anchored. You were anchor.

186
00:29:42,250 --> 00:30:00,059
Okay. I'm going on this one. Okay. All right. Let's go over the plan again. I grabbed the wall

187
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,819
first. You grabbed and I grabbed and then what happened there though? I feel like we did that

188
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:10,250
pretty well. I think you might've just let go at a weird angle and then we didn't, we didn't

189
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:30,250
launch up. We kind of launched very true. All right. Why have we got this? I'm going to go

190
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:43,670
on this one. I don't know. I don't know. It was too late. I like the first one. I feel like the

191
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:49,160
first one was too early. All right. That one must've been too late. Not enough momentum.

192
00:30:50,119 --> 00:31:21,829
I'm going to go on this one. Good thing I pulled you. All right, buddy. I'm going to go on the next

193
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:29,109
one. You're doing it too late. Is it? Really though? I thought that one was pretty good.

194
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:38,069
My momentum's going up, not left by the time you let go. I'm so concerned that it's not going to

195
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:50,460
be enough. Whatever. I'm going on, not this one. Is it going the wrong way? Okay. Going on this one.

196
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:57,740
No, it's hard. It's hard. There we go. Okay. I'm just going to go on whenever I can.

197
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:28,250
Is that enough? Okay. Go one. This one. Oh, yes. Oh, oh, just bring yourself up. Nice job.

198
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,690
High five. High five. High five there. No, don't jump. Don't jump. No, no, no. False, false. Okay.

199
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:42,140
I was trying to emote. Just give me the finger. Yeah. Rock, paper, scissors. I don't even know

200
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,740
what button that is on mine. Okay. We got to jump up and grab this wall. Wait. Okay. You talk about

201
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:55,240
the wall, the vertical wall. Yes. Okay. Can we even get it? Yes. Let's do a test to make sure.

202
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,339
We can do it. All right. Who is grabbing? You or me? Oh, you want to do a test? Yeah, we can

203
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:14,940
absolutely do that. I will grab. You are grabbing. Okay. Ready? Yes. Okay. And you just get up here

204
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:25,859
or do we need to go from here? I don't know. I think you can get up here. Yeah. Oh. All right.

205
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:36,099
Stop swinging. Stop swinging for one second. Let's pull on mine. I don't think you can pull

206
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:50,390
me here. I can. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now we're jumping left. Oh, yeah. I didn't think we were

207
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:58,470
going to get up this far. What are you doing? We're going to the top. Good luck, guys. You'll

208
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:09,659
need it. Is it just going to be a bunch of people that make fun of us? Probably. He said, watch it.

209
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:19,860
Hold on. He said, watch out. What does this say? You already have that. Chad is here.

210
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:30,730
That's true. All right. Simple. You almost didn't make that. All right. You want me to anchor?

211
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:36,019
Yeah, that's big. This is a lot. And we can overshoot this too. So,

212
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:49,429
GG. I'm going to go. I'm just going to pick a good time. Got it? Oh, GG. What is this hook?

213
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:56,630
I don't know. You want to try and grab it? Jump up and grab it? Yeah.

214
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:10,409
It went too far. That's bait. I don't want to get a picture. No one cares.

215
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:16,380
Oh, yeah. That was bait. Was it? It was all bait. Everything. The whole thing was bait. What do

216
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,800
you mean? Everything. I'm bait. You're bait. Oh, boy. We're falling apart. Hold on. You didn't

217
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:40,199
anchor. You didn't anchor. You didn't anchor. You didn't anchor. Oh, it's all right. Let's speedrun.

218
00:35:40,199 --> 00:36:12,389
You can help. Speedrun. Nothing's going to go wrong. I don't. Okay. Just pull me up. We can do

219
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:20,039
it. We got baited. It's fine. Just pull me up. Speedrun. We should not even need to communicate

220
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:37,849
for these ones. Yeah. We've done them so many times. Can I pull you from here? Fuck. Okay. No

221
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:42,650
communication right now. Okay. No communication. Silence. I want silence and I want you to fucking

222
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:47,500
go. Ready? Put both your headphones in if they're not in. I know mine weren't. Ready? We're just

223
00:36:47,500 --> 00:37:14,250
going. Yeah. That's not a jump we can make. Oh, are we still communicating?

224
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:37,909
Let go. Let go. Okay. Fingers are sweaty. All right. Let's see. This game is like,

225
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:41,750
hey, play this game with your friend and see like try to this patience. And is it your real friend?

226
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:56,010
This book is all over me. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no. Let's just do it the right way.

227
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:01,130
Okay. Why? What did you just say?

228
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:22,650
I can. Yeah, we're good. Now I'm just going to go like this. Let's see who your true friends are.

229
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:31,530
We're incapable of jumping unless I do a full 360. I did look at my keyboard. I didn't know

230
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:51,670
when fucking Z was. Okay. Ready? I'm grabbing. Yes. I can just pull you up. Oh, buddy boy. Oh,

231
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:59,110
buddy boy. You're you're trying to do something. No, no, no, no, no. You just you went at the wrong

232
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:22,460
time. Play it back and times minus 10 speed. You're trolling. I'm very concerned about you.

233
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,940
Don't be. I want to win just as much as you do. Truthfully, I don't want to.

234
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:45,349
I suspect that the cost of winning is too high on the next one. Okay. You grab. Then I grab

235
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:22,739
going on the next one. That was not fast enough. Jesus Christ. All right. You grab. Nice. Oh,

236
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:33,110
I had a leg. All right. We need to take this one slow because this is the hard one. This jump is

237
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:40,860
the hard jump. Do we? Okay. Right here. You think right here? Right in the middle or further up?

238
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:47,139
You're good. I you need to be going full revolutions like crazy. I'm aware that you

239
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:56,840
need a full revolution man. There it is. All right. Okay, we can do this one. Can we look down?

240
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:02,380
Like what is going on here? I don't know. Is that that next jump felt impossible? It did.

241
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:10,099
Unless we have to swing. We might have to do a big swing jump. Well, let's just get on with this

242
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:20,219
hook. What is with the hook? There's there's I don't think we can get it though. Okay. Okay.

243
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:29,639
What do we do? There's no way. Is there no way? But it has to be that's pointing. It's playing

244
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:35,619
there. Wait, we can save the game. How? I don't know. It's a save states. Some people are saying

245
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:40,679
save, save, save states, save states. What are you doing? If you get the item, it will give you

246
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:49,190
save states. You want to just use one here? We already have one. Well, I don't know. I don't

247
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,670
know what they're talking about. How do we use it? I think it was like one of the F keys. Maybe.

248
00:41:53,670 --> 00:42:08,789
Was it a lie? Save checkpoint. Yeah. We use it. I can't do it. So I guess maybe we do have to get

249
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:16,039
this. All right. What if we just drop down? We're getting one guide over. It's assist options. It's

250
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:24,949
under assist options. Oh, so it's if you're bad. But I know this is your least favorite game in

251
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:31,800
the world. You don't like to have to start completely over at zero and do it all over again.

252
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:41,559
You hate that, don't you? I do. You do? Well, it depends. Look, we're just going to do it right.

253
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:46,489
Okay. You ready? I'm just going to do it right. Why did you do that? Why would you do that?

254
00:42:48,869 --> 00:43:02,389
You ready? Okay. Yes. All the way. You're gonna have to pull me up. Why don't we do a running

255
00:43:02,389 --> 00:43:10,059
jump on this one? Like run at the same time? Oh, his brain is exploding. Okay. The go,

256
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:14,059
the three, two, one, go is going to be to start running. And then once you hit the end, just jump.

257
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:23,510
Okay. All right. Yeah, I get it. I get it. I get it. Okay. Oh, we actually did it. Damn,

258
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:28,230
that was a good call. You could just let me hang because we got it. We got to do another jump here.

259
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,989
Right. But this is going to be horrible. Or we're all the way back at the beginning.

260
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:36,280
And notice this is, okay, we're just going to do the full rotation. This is a big jump. Full

261
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:49,699
rotation. Trying to get it. I'm trying to get it in the right direction. Okay. You got it. You got

262
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:55,300
it. Nice. Okay, we're good. So now we're at, okay, don't let's not freak out. Get hands off the

263
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:00,579
keyboard for a second. Wipe your hands. Hands are getting sweaty. Yep. Okay. So I think we have to

264
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:09,820
go either up or down. I don't know which one is the right one. Oh, it's pointing up. I don't know

265
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:17,289
what that basket is. Maybe there is like an NPC or something down here. It dangle me. I can't see.

266
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:23,420
I'm blind. You can't see anything. There's a hoop down there, right? It's like a net. Yeah,

267
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,309
let's go down there. Should we? I feel like this is scary. It'll be easy to get back up. Oh,

268
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:37,690
it's just a hoop. Okay. What if I throw you in that? Can we like do that? I mean, we could

269
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:42,329
swing off the top if we want it to put someone in the hoop. But why? I feel like it's the game

270
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:55,530
is saying, hey, there's a hoop here. You should get dunked in the hoop. Do you want to get dunked

271
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:00,090
in the hoop? I mean, we could try it. You want to just dangle and I'll let go. Let's jump across

272
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:12,579
and I'll grab that wall and dangle you into it. Okay. So you're going to have to let go.

273
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:18,579
That was fun. That was great. Hey, we did it. That's fantastic. Wait, maybe I have to grab it.

274
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:24,389
How do you do the pull up? For me, it was Z. It's a very specific key you have to have it be.

275
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:47,400
What is the key for you? Q. All right, let's just go up. It's like that is a signal. Hey,

276
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,690
I'm not going to make the mistake because I know that you'll be like, look at what you did. And

277
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:59,380
you're so bad at games. Oh, look at you. Now what? We got to slingshot someone at that wall.

278
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:15,099
I'll grab it. Okay. I'm going to throw you at it. I think we need a full revolution. I got it.

279
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:21,000
Good. Now you grab that one. We got it. We got to grab the other side. Yep. I need a little bit

280
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,500
slack. Okay. And you're going to have to let go when I'm in the right spot. Nice job. And that's

281
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:38,019
how we get up here. That's how we get up to 70 fucking two. Don't blow it here. All right.

282
00:46:38,019 --> 00:47:02,260
Ready? You need more room? Okay. Hold on. Swing. For what? I'm telling you. Swing. Swing.

283
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:08,699
Oh, so a full swing. I can't full swing because there's a wall. We're good. So we didn't drop all

284
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:24,760
the way down. This is the one we have to run at, right? Yep. You know what? Are you confident in

285
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:31,300
this? Do you want me to do it? We're going to maintain our roles. We're not. We're not goofing

286
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:57,179
around. Okay. Good. Roles maintained. Stare. No goofing. Stare. No goofing. Was that a goof?

287
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:00,460
You goofing right now? Are you seriously goofing when we're about to do the big jumps?

288
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:07,610
No. Or the big boys? All right. Same deal. I might actually have to grab this though.

289
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:27,769
I mean, whoever can grab it, grab it. Yeah. You have your mouse on your screen apparently.

290
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:41,559
Somebody came into my chat to tell me that. Oh no. Is he okay? I need to do CPR. Oh,

291
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:59,900
twerk it. Twerk it. All right. You want to climb the mountain again? Kind of. Shit. No,

292
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:24,090
we got to go back. Sorry. I feel like this three, two, one go, finding out that there's a pleasant

293
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:29,590
beep, beep, beep, beep. It's just like activating, like neurons are firing in your brain,

294
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:36,010
like unparalleled. So we have to keep going. When you hear the boom, you're like you're just

295
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,449
out ready. I gotta jump. I gotta jump. I gotta jump. It's like the Mario Kart thing. It's like

296
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:53,210
then you've like fucking eyes, your pupils just go fucking wide. What is it? Like a rat in a

297
00:49:53,210 --> 00:50:05,349
Skinner box? You've been conditioned. I'm grabbing it. Okay. Wait, no, no, no. You can't, on go,

298
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:10,710
you can't say no way. I know, but I was confident that I could grab you if you jumped. If we

299
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:37,239
failed and you didn't seem ready. What the fuck? I thought that was good. I'm dragging your ass

300
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:58,570
up the mountain. I don't even care. Oh, geez. One last real try and then we'll play the other one.

301
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:06,219
Is this really going to be a three game night? I don't know. Are you down after this? I don't

302
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:23,539
know. I'm just surprised that. Okay, I'm grabbing. Hey, just in case you didn't know, I'm grabbing.

303
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:38,980
I have an itchy head. Don't wait. Don't wait. Okay. You're grabbing first, right? I'm grabbing.

304
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:57,579
That's pressing shift. Sorry. Anytime I play a game like this, do you get like this too?

305
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:02,469
Where like I'm, I said at this desk, I've probably sat here for hundreds and hundreds,

306
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:07,460
if not maybe thousands of hours. I right now, I'm so uncomfortable. It's just like,

307
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:11,860
oh no, everything's wrong. Like where I am seated, how high I am in the chair,

308
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:18,760
where my fingers are, everything just feels incorrect. I get that in other games.

309
00:52:18,760 --> 00:53:04,969
No. Okay. Okay. That one is actually really hard. What a deluge. What are you doing?

310
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,639
You did the Mario thing where you jump after, jump after landing perfectly. Well,

311
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:14,760
I pressed up to try and pull you up because that's what I thought it was before.

312
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:31,500
Okay. We, we botched this twice in a row. What's the problem? You botched this because

313
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,780
you're the one letting go. Yeah. But it's, I feel like it's, this is very precise, very difficult.

314
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:42,340
I think you really, you really got a running jumpy. I don't know. You just got to do it.

315
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:49,960
You just got to be good. I'm going to go for it. I'm doing a perfect circle. That was, I mean,

316
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:55,289
that was good. That was like, I don't know if I could do better than that. I don't know if I

317
00:53:55,289 --> 00:54:00,710
could have done better than that. That was like right there. What the hell? You've done better

318
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:16,980
than that. No, I didn't. I damn it. What are we doing? What am I doing wrong there? Are you

319
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:24,389
jumping or are you not? All right. Do you want, do you want to move on to the cat horror game or what?

320
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:32,949
I will continue to play as you want to play. Let's get up there one more time. And then

321
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:48,739
do you want to try that? Do you want to try that? It's tricky. This game is addicting though.

322
00:54:48,739 --> 00:54:55,349
Really fun concept. I love the concept. Apparently you can play it in single player and you get like

323
00:54:55,349 --> 00:55:05,769
a rock. That's weird. I'm not exactly sure how that works. Do you want to try these or do you

324
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:13,159
want me to just keep going for it? Stay in your lane. Yeah, but me staying in my lane didn't work

325
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:21,780
out the last time. I, you have more experience under your belt. That's true. I don't want to

326
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:45,420
throw that experience away, but like also you're really kind of trash. No, it's hard. You do it.

327
00:55:45,980 --> 00:56:02,820
And you'll see it's hard. It's, it's like the moment. I'm doing it. You're trash. You're trash.

328
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:15,940
You are trash. You trash can garbage can. No, get back. You get back in there and you,

329
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:26,090
we're doing it. You closed it. Okay. We could, we could do it right.

330
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,090
I, it wouldn't be funny if you were, if you just weren't even close.

331
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:38,710
That's funny. How you doing? Are you, are you, are you good? You still, you still here? No,

332
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:44,460
sure. We, we can, I'll invite you again. Cool. All right, let's go. What do you like,

333
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:51,579
what do you like about these kinds of torture CBT games? Cause it, it shows the, it shows your

334
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:58,010
character. It shows if you're really able to persevere through something very, very difficult.

335
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:07,460
It takes a lot of patience, which I don't have any of, which is, it's a great challenge for me

336
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:18,360
because I have zero patience. What? I have zero patience. So it's a good challenge to sit down

337
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:24,900
and be like, just do it. Okay. You, I want you to do these because you need to get some experience.

338
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:32,010
I don't want to do it. I want to stay in our lane. Okay. We're going to stay in our lanes.

339
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:38,570
Okay. Why did we just do that? We could have just jumped normally.

340
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:52,630
Well, you were getting practice. Oh, I see. I do want you to be a little bit more confident in

341
00:57:52,630 --> 00:58:24,920
these though. I don't need to do a full 360 for these tiny ones. You're right. No fucking,

342
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:35,940
I don't have patience. I do gardening and clay sculptures. Do you have any plants? No. Why not?

343
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:45,800
Why do I need plants? That's fun. Wrong way. What happens if now's not a good time to test?

344
00:58:48,170 --> 00:59:10,179
Now's not a good time to test. I don't think it is. Remember this part. Well, that was weird.

345
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:23,829
I held it. I'm dying. I'm actually going to die. Stop. You're freaking me out. That one's actually

346
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:51,429
really, really hard. It is. Stop fucking around. Thanks. All right. We're back. Not yet. We're not

347
00:59:51,429 --> 01:00:03,989
back yet. We're almost back. You fucker. You, you got in my head. You were like, you need to go faster

348
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:29,179
with these ones. Not this one. This one's tough. We're not, it's fine. We're right here. You're

349
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:34,940
doing those way too late. I know, but it's just, it's a little, just go. I'll get it again. I'll get

350
01:00:34,940 --> 01:01:05,159
it. Okay. It's hard. I promise. It's tricky. Hey, you got the easy job. You just have to dangle.

351
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:26,949
There you go. There's no encouragement. Do not encourage. Don't encourage me. Okay. Which do you

352
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:44,550
like more, the game or me suffering? Oh, I need a full revolution for these. You got it. You got it.

353
01:01:44,550 --> 01:02:12,199
We got it. That was a, that's tough one. Oh, wait, hold on. It's sweaty. Oh yeah. My game lagged. It

354
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:18,699
actually did. I swear to God people saw it. It was like, it actually happened. I swear to God,

355
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:25,219
it actually happened. It really happened. It's unfortunate. It really did. I wish I was making

356
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:44,760
it up. I'm not about those checkpoints. Stop and do it. All right. You, you claim to want to try

357
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,000
and then like, you get us in, we get out of a rhythm and then you like anchor yourself on the ground.

358
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:56,489
I'm, I'm coping. All right. This is the last one we're going to do. And then you want to play the

359
01:02:56,489 --> 01:03:04,949
other game or you take it off. I keep hearing, this is the last one, but I feel like you really

360
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:09,880
deeply want this. I don't think we're going to beat it. I just want to get up to a hundred.

361
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:57,690
We're at like 75, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. All right. Don't do that. Ding, ding,

362
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:01,449
actually stop doing that. Cause you're like a, you're like 30 milliseconds, like later,

363
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:35,420
I don't I don't like that. Finally, we can agree you're gonna fucking kill us keeping you on your toes. Uh-huh. You got it

364
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:49,940
Come on

365
01:04:49,940 --> 01:05:04,719
There it is. All right, we're back. Oh, wow. We're back

366
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,739
Really back. This is this is the wall right here. It's been the wall the whole time

367
01:05:11,139 --> 01:05:14,780
All right, let me let me get ready. So I'm doing it too late or too early

368
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:20,980
I don't know. I don't know what you're doing. This is to get a failure. Okay. All right. All right

369
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:29,960
You're not gonna make it. I'm doing it too late too late too late. I'm not gonna make it if you're going the wrong way

370
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:37,500
And there it is and there oh

371
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:53,760
We're back 72. This is where we lost last time. This is the one right here. We're gonna get up to a hundred

372
01:05:53,880 --> 01:06:04,929
Stop looking around. I know you mess around. This one's fucked up. It is I need you on your a game

373
01:06:04,929 --> 01:06:05,449
All right

374
01:06:05,449 --> 01:06:10,289
I have to do this one a little later as we get some air because it's higher than us. All right

375
01:06:10,289 --> 01:06:26,860
Here we go. I'm going for it. I need a full revolution bingo. All right, 75. Let's go. Oh

376
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:37,030
This one might be hard because is it is it a jump from here? No, it's not this is a game ender

377
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:41,849
This is if we slide down we got to climb all the way back up here again. All right, we're not gonna

378
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:43,849
That's that's not have the end

379
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:53,039
People saying save it right now. What button is saved? I gotta go into like cheater mode because it's options

380
01:06:53,679 --> 01:07:03,239
Options has um, it's check do checkpoint checkpoint checkpoint. We bought we got a card didn't we so F is not let me try it

381
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:07,960
What is it on mine? What's on my friend and

382
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:16,539
Okay, let's try it ready. Yeah, I don't think it doesn't do anything doesn't do anything either. We talked to the guy

383
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:22,349
Let's might as well talk. I don't know

384
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:29,030
Assist mode needs to be turned on. Yes, just mode checkpoints. Ah

385
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:32,789
And then there's pole rope which was on by default

386
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:46,730
Infinite jumps who cares anymore? We don't need any of them. That's when I get to a hundred. Okay, so if we go oh, oh

387
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:57,670
Look at that. Okay, cool. So the plan is we know the plan. I grabbed first. Yes

388
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:31,270
Okay, and then I'm gonna let you go. You're gonna grab that wall. You gotta let go. You ready? Yes. Yes

389
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:45,420
All right, here we are we didn't even need the checkpoint look at this 85 we're good

390
01:08:49,399 --> 01:09:00,420
This might be a run-and-jumper. Okay, let's do run. Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. What?

391
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:13,439
All right, are you dumping your pants right now or are we playing you know, why we're gamer diapers, I'm just going for it

392
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,899
Fuck yeah, we got the clock. Let's go

393
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:31,189
Oh

394
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:32,510
Okay

395
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:47,359
Now, how do we get back to the checkpoint? I don't know. How do we get to the checkpoint? See em. Oh, I like this game

396
01:09:47,359 --> 01:10:31,020
No, ready now. Let go. Thank you. We're fine. You look so defeated me your character. Oh

397
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:54,000
All right, let's go same deal. This is a run-and-jumper good idea. What are you doing?

398
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,640
Don't you criticize me when you don't know how hard it is. You gave it one attempt and you were like, yeah

399
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:03,520
You're not even waiting for the food. All right, you gave this one attempt an alt F forward the game

400
01:11:08,939 --> 01:11:36,399
Fucking weird you didn't even grab anything you didn't either true. It's the quiet moments in life. I agree

401
01:11:36,939 --> 01:11:54,010
You really take in the the snowflakes the beautiful horizon to its wonderful looking. Don't worry. I grabbed it. What's the plan here?

402
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,060
Oh

403
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,979
Perfect timing

404
01:11:59,979 --> 01:12:18,729
This is a jump. This is a jump. This is a jump. Mm-hmm. This is a jump waiting for the countdown

405
01:12:18,729 --> 01:12:36,420
I haven't seen it. This is a jump. Mm-hmm. You grab in a run start. I'll grab a call

406
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:50,140
This is a jump. Yes, it is run start. No, that's gonna fuck us up. It actually mmm

407
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:55,859
This might be a swing throw checkpoint. It might be let's just cheat

408
01:12:55,859 --> 01:12:59,789
Let's jump at it and try and grab it if you miss. All right, what do you want?

409
01:12:59,829 --> 01:13:04,180
I don't I mean if we're gonna cheat might as well cheat

410
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,829
Somebody's cheating. Are you ready? I

411
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,720
Got you. I think this is a regular jump to

412
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:27,579
There we are. Look at that get it out of your system cuz we're about to it's about to get hard

413
01:13:27,739 --> 01:13:39,819
We made it we made it past the first area. We did it or not at a hundred yet. No, we're not

414
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:53,619
I mean that good call I guess now what oh, we're just like, yeah

415
01:13:53,899 --> 01:14:06,979
Alright, I was about to do it too. No, you weren't cat horror game now

416
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:20,479
No, I'm going for it. I'm going for it, right? No, I can't start the swinging down here

417
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:32,739
It kills the momentum and if you drop I can see there's like shit down there. We don't got to do. Okay

418
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:45,369
All right, that's bad. No, they come back. Okay, let's walk over. I guess I just drop you down there

419
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:49,189
Oh, wait, we angle you down. Wait, wait, wait

420
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:56,289
That's a jump up here jump up to the wall. This might need a running start here. Let's go to the other side

421
01:14:56,369 --> 01:15:01,810
We're gonna run across and do a jump up. Oh, yeah, just in case we're gonna be careful. I feel you

422
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:11,340
Oh, this is gonna be hard. Do you want me to grab?

423
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:16,020
Yeah, I want you to fucking grab it. Well, I have you played this before

424
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:21,020
Yeah, I you know, I didn't you did even if I was gonna grab you didn't give me enough time to swing over and grab

425
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:26,619
I didn't even give me enough to let go. I love it. You flip. I love it

426
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:30,180
You flipped it on me. You flipped it on me, but you just went for it. You flipped it on me, too

427
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:32,380
That was uncalled for you could have grabbed

428
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:36,659
Okay, everything's fine just relax

429
01:15:37,340 --> 01:16:03,619
Wait for wait for me to grab it. You gotta go. Yep on me up or do you you're gonna pull me up?

430
01:16:03,619 --> 01:16:12,550
Are we what's happening here? I'm enjoying this. I really need like rest, you know, I

431
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,460
Did it myself don't worry

432
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:26,079
Three one, two, three go. I don't do that. I had to

433
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,840
Don't do that

434
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:36,239
You have to it that's it bill it's built-in timing. All right. All right. All right. All right. We're good

435
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:55,569
You just gotta go for it. All right built-in timing. We're just doing the built-in timing. It's built in just do a plot

436
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,569
It's a normal platformer right now. Oh, yeah

437
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:02,739
Okay now wait patience figure out where we're going

438
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:09,060
This is tricky cuz we have to jump together to that top left. You'll grab it and then we'll swing. No, no, no

439
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:14,640
No, wait, wait, you don't think so. Yes, you're right. I'm gonna I'm gonna jump in I'm gonna grab it

440
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:17,560
built-in timing

441
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:35,250
Good. Okay, that's gonna fall. So built-in timing. Okay. Okay. Good. Oh

442
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:41,199
Wait, hold on. We don't have to there's no built-in timing right now. There is it's a platform

443
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:45,079
We need to see what's going on here. We get his go. Just jump up to it. Oh, wait, wait

444
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:50,640
All right, you're any fucking bill in timing and you didn't even do it, right, sir

445
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:55,010
I'm gonna enjoy this

446
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:58,449
Thank you. Thank you for like for taking a second here because I can fucking use it

447
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:02,390
Built-in timing top left. Wait, wait, wait

448
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:07,430
Okay, you can't just do that. What are you talking about?

449
01:18:14,109 --> 01:18:31,460
We got a swing and then you we need to run yes built-in timing after you land good good idea

450
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,180
This might be built-in timing built-in timing. I'm not sure

451
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,180
Oh

452
01:18:39,619 --> 01:18:43,060
Get up here get up here get up here get up here we've ducked no, I don't know what to do

453
01:18:43,579 --> 01:18:47,500
Right. I do rap feels the timing build the timing this way. All right, we're fine

454
01:18:47,939 --> 01:18:59,250
We've got it. All right, you grab you always grab first

455
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:07,600
It didn't grab cuz I was on the ground I expected it to grab

456
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:16,800
What what kind of fucked up Mario game have you been playing with the built-in timing is that early?

457
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,300
We need to wait for this I think

458
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:28,840
Oh, I think I I think I think I know what to do. Oh my god

459
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:33,590
Okay, we I don't know. I don't get it. We need to look at it for a second

460
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:44,329
I'm kind of wondering if you can grab the side of it. What about just jump and left left. I duck

461
01:19:48,329 --> 01:19:54,779
Okay, we got it like either swing to that platform. I think I think we go left from the middle here built-in timing

462
01:19:55,239 --> 01:20:01,060
Wait, what? What have you done? No

463
01:20:01,819 --> 01:20:07,180
No, I thought we built in time. I thought we built in tits. All right built into what you said

464
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:12,260
I think we need left. I didn't know what left you meant. Sorry lucky to just pick this up. We're fine

465
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:24,229
Okay, so we're gonna drop and then go left drop left built in timing pull me up

466
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:34,399
You grab then we'll swing that was fucked up and you know, it that was weird on you. You did great

467
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,600
What are you? What are you doing? What's happening to you?

468
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:43,800
What's happening to you? You didn't anchor when I we why did you not anchor?

469
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,550
This is so

470
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:54,590
How come you jumped weird you're weird

471
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:02,170
It's all right, it's all right for some stupid reason I thought this is gonna drop to we're fine

472
01:21:02,729 --> 01:21:13,609
See you need to anchor who?

473
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:20,439
How are we doing this? I don't know we just talk about it. Can we just talk through this? Let's talk

474
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:28,359
I think we can make the jump from here to there if we do it

475
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,250
And then we built in timing

476
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:35,600
To the top right. Okay, maybe

477
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:45,130
Yep. Okay, we're good now stop and let's look at this one, too

478
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:52,760
We're gonna gotta as the things coming down. We're gonna need to built in timing built in timing building timing. Hold on

479
01:21:53,560 --> 01:22:00,020
That's fucked up. Isn't it? Okay. Okay next one

480
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:03,380
We're doing next one as soon as we see the next one coming down. We're gonna jump across

481
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:06,319
All right, but what how far down is it back midway?

482
01:22:06,979 --> 01:22:11,239
What do you want to go midway? Do you want to wait till it's kind of at the bottom?

483
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:15,250
What do you think I think we have to wait till it's past the bottom?

484
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:37,119
Because otherwise we'll hit our heads. I'm gonna count it down. All right almost do you get infinite checkpoints?

485
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,479
Stirb wanted to cheat and I was okay

486
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:41,899
I kept saying man

487
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:45,159
We should really try to do it like on our own and try to really get the achievement of doing it

488
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:47,439
But he was like he DM me a few times over here. Just like dude

489
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:53,680
I'm fucking leaving if you don't let me do this. He's like, I'm gonna make up a story how I have to go

490
01:22:53,819 --> 01:22:55,819
Then I'm just like

491
01:22:55,979 --> 01:23:02,720
Right annoying good job

492
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:14,079
Man we're on our toes. Okay, this is double coming by

493
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:24,220
Hold me up to the right

494
01:23:24,619 --> 01:23:31,880
Pull me up. Pull me up. Pull me up. We need to not good timings

495
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:37,039
These are not we need it cuz automatic timings cuz I your timing on where you would do that jump is different than mine

496
01:23:37,239 --> 01:23:40,079
Yeah commander. Give me the give me the little bit

497
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,439
I don't even know what button that is on mine. I have a different controls. No. No, you don't need to do that

498
01:23:44,439 --> 01:23:49,699
Just like vocally. Okay, I'm gonna go tell me about it. All right ready three two one go

499
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:53,020
There we are again again again

500
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:56,439
If we have to go like you stopped, I know but I I was

501
01:23:57,159 --> 01:23:58,079
distracted

502
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:00,079
Can you get on that?

503
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:04,539
Let go. Oh nice job. All right, pull me up

504
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:16,840
Three two one. All right, we gotta go boom. Boom. You ready? One, two, three go

505
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:18,340
Nope

506
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:26,560
There we are. Boom. Boom. Then this is another good. This is ready one two go. I wasn't ready

507
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:31,460
I but I wasn't ready. It's all right. I but that wasn't you got to take quarterback then

508
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:53,770
You got to be quarterback. Look at these fucking timings. Very good. That's not correct. That was does not it's not correct

509
01:24:54,289 --> 01:25:06,930
Okay, three two one go. Okay. Okay. I understand. I did not understand what you're talking about. So I'm ready to go

510
01:25:07,489 --> 01:25:10,529
All right, just just jump off off here. Okay, we're gonna

511
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:21,140
Very good. Very good. I think I'm lost

512
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:37,760
There look at that. Oh my fingers cramping up. Okay. Here's what's gonna happen

513
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:50,460
Three two one go we jump on those. Okay, and they're gonna fall and then grab you're gonna grab nice

514
01:25:50,779 --> 01:26:00,130
This one looks like it's a jump grab and then I grab wall and then I okay. Hold on

515
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:04,529
We gotta get this planned out. This is a we jump you grab the left side of wall

516
01:26:04,649 --> 01:26:11,930
I swing around I grab right side of wall you go. I let go we land on built-in timing

517
01:26:12,329 --> 01:26:16,109
We have to built-in timing jump to that right wall and I don't know what the hell's over there

518
01:26:16,229 --> 01:26:23,819
Yep, so you're gonna grab that right most wall. Yep. Okay, right. Let's all the way to the left running start

519
01:26:23,819 --> 01:26:41,250
Yep for this one. Okay. Here we go. Okay good. I'm gonna grab the other side of the wall. Mm-hmm

520
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:46,689
Okay, here we go

521
01:26:46,689 --> 01:26:55,090
Beautiful. All right. This is where it gets kind of weird. Are we checkpoint Andes?

522
01:26:55,529 --> 01:26:57,529
Yeah, we're look we've already done

523
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:07,260
Six of them so far all of the tension is gone. Hey, it's we're having fun though

524
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:19,909
Well, I thought I think we just jump when it's hitting the bottom or no when it's hitting the top maybe yeah

525
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:24,149
Hey ready, I'm gonna count three tops and then we're gonna jump

526
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:30,630
Okay, we jump on the fourth top so like one two jump on the third one or jump on the like technically the fourth one

527
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:34,170
like top top

528
01:27:34,409 --> 01:27:40,890
Top Joe. Okay. Okay. Okay one two three

529
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,920
We're okay

530
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:57,520
I think it's gonna work. I think I think it's gonna work. Okay

531
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,399
top

532
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:01,399
top top

533
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:03,569
Bottom. Yeah, see

534
01:28:03,689 --> 01:28:10,670
This is a built-in timing this is we jump right when we hit the top and then built-in timing to the right, okay

535
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:13,039
All right

536
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:14,359
Same deal

537
01:28:14,359 --> 01:28:18,359
We're your top top go. No, keep it the same top top top go

538
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,930
There's no need for three top top top. There is keep it consider. You told me to stay consistent with our roles

539
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:26,130
Consistency there's an update. There was a patch

540
01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:31,850
Top top go top top go. Okay, you do the count top

541
01:28:32,369 --> 01:28:34,369
Top go

542
01:28:34,649 --> 01:28:43,770
I went look at us

543
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:47,069
We don't even got a fucking talk about it people that people that come to the stream

544
01:28:47,449 --> 01:28:51,710
Are they don't tell them we're using checkpoints until they have to find out cuz they'll think we're good at the end

545
01:28:52,029 --> 01:28:58,819
So I gotta like I gotta like hold on. Yeah, what's yeah, what's the deal here? We got we gotta hide it. Oh

546
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:03,979
Hide it. I see what what is that? It's part of the environment. It's a piece of wood

547
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,159
Okay, okay

548
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:14,130
So I'm gonna jump and grab and then I don't know you jump and grab and then you have to let go when I get

549
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:22,500
To the point where I can yeah, that's the hold on. Oh, it doesn't break. Oh, okay

550
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:38,819
Alright don't jump and grab. Okay, this doesn't make sense

551
01:29:40,539 --> 01:29:44,979
You yeah, you need to land what let's grab the I think we could do grab the other side

552
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:50,079
What we get one of us can get up and land on top. So like yeah

553
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:57,359
No, I don't think that's a strat just hit a swing around and land on top of this just land on it

554
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:01,449
But it's gonna break and then you're gonna be dangling below me

555
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:15,670
All right, what do you want to do? There's a hole the whole area to the right is extra. Um, I think that's actually what we have to do

556
01:30:16,109 --> 01:30:26,029
Or maybe go up. No, maybe go from the top. If can we like throw ourselves up? All right, just give me some I

557
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:39,130
I don't know how the grab is allowed to work here. Hold on. I don't know

558
01:30:40,529 --> 01:30:56,680
You're driving. Oh, I thought you want to try something. So what what's your plan? I want to try and not fall on it

559
01:30:58,039 --> 01:30:58,960
Oh

560
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:08,710
Try to grab the other side. That's what I'm saying, but it doesn't let me like swing inward. Mm-hmm. I have an idea

561
01:31:09,689 --> 01:31:15,310
Let me throw you

562
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:27,329
It might

563
01:31:27,329 --> 01:31:29,329
Everybody we're gonna do our

564
01:31:29,409 --> 01:31:32,970
20 minute everybody closes their eyes and relaxes. Okay, close your eyes

565
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:45,779
What are you doing? We didn't do check one. All right, whatever. Well, we got it. Okay. I tried to grab it

566
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:52,220
It's dead it's it has to be you grab the other side

567
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,430
No, no

568
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:11,560
Pull me up you swing you do this swing. So I'm gonna grab it. Okay, you do a full rotation

569
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:26,159
That's why we stick to our roles, huh? Oh, it's not as easy as it looks. Oh you tried it one time. I

570
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,689
Didn't I know?

571
01:32:28,689 --> 01:32:41,960
Shut up and get off here. Do you hold left or do you have to go like one do I got it?

572
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:45,680
Then you hold there then once you've spun around you hold the direction

573
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:52,210
Okay, I get it. I thought you had I thought I still had to change momentum from different sides

574
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:56,260
I didn't know you could hold it. Thanks for telling me the controls by the way

575
01:32:56,260 --> 01:33:03,920
Oh, wow, when you're only going one direction, you only hold one direction. We open our eyes. Not yet. It's still relaxing time

576
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:24,739
Are you ready? Oh my god. Oh, I was thinking okay. Okay

577
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,479
We've just been learning we've been learning the rules of the world. Yes, we have

578
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:39,439
Okay, you can open your eyes now. Chill. I don't know. I don't know we're good

579
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:45,930
I think we just have to just whip our just throw ourselves to the left kind of here you hold

580
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:54,479
We assume our roles we're going for you got it. That was weird. It was weird. I

581
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,319
Think yeah, yeah, it doesn't really give any momentum

582
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:16,239
I think you have to grab the other side after you get thrown over there. It's gonna be

583
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:21,739
It actually might not be that hard if you if we do it like I throw you kind of in the air like this

584
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:27,399
I think here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think

585
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:29,399
Here's what I think. Here's what I think. Here's what I think when I'm swinging around

586
01:34:29,479 --> 01:34:31,479
Yeah, and I'm slightly above it

587
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:45,850
You need to let go so you're dropping pulls me down and then I grab the other side and so I'm like here

588
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:52,640
Kind of rare kind of kind of kind of kind of I don't I feel like this isn't the way to do it and we're gonna

589
01:34:52,640 --> 01:35:01,399
Get like the advanced version of this and we're not gonna be we're just gonna be I don't know what we're gonna be

590
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:12,640
Hey, I'm gonna do it like shit, there's no way that both way grab both climb and run

591
01:35:14,279 --> 01:35:34,710
There's climbing what I mean climbing. I don't think you can climb you replace stir with penis music

592
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:42,520
You mean to round out stir with penis music that be wouldn't be able to hear his call out. Just climb just climb

593
01:35:43,039 --> 01:36:04,649
Okay, you hold on you hold it. Whoa. Hold on a minute again. Hey, hold on stay there. Hey, let go

594
01:36:04,649 --> 01:36:07,520
I almost had it. That was close

595
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:17,819
That was very close. It's not what ready

596
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:23,590
Let go now. Oh my god. I had it. I just should have jumped the other way

597
01:36:24,109 --> 01:36:44,039
They're eating her then they're gonna eat me. We got ready shit. That's it. I'm the third swing

598
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:52,340
Do you want to do it? Do you want me to do it? You do it? I'm the grabber. That's one

599
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,479
Do you do the third one you're in the perfect spot?

600
01:36:57,329 --> 01:37:03,579
Mmm, I heard but then I don't get I don't get it. I don't get when you're on there. It's just gonna break

601
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:14,000
And I'm dangling unless you like perfectly grab the left side without ever standing on it. Just do it swing again. I'm here

602
01:37:25,409 --> 01:37:42,260
Yeah, the left wall has to get grabbed you grab okay one two three

603
01:37:44,189 --> 01:37:52,979
Hell yeah. All right. Hold on. Well, that was weird it bumped me. Yeah, we got it. Nice

604
01:37:53,500 --> 01:38:06,170
All right, you can open your eyes. Okay, there's a wooden horizontal over there

605
01:38:06,449 --> 01:38:09,489
Yeah, I think I just get to that and a built-in timing

606
01:38:14,979 --> 01:38:19,989
The jump was uh

607
01:38:19,989 --> 01:38:38,039
Weird. Oh, man. We should have put a no, we don't need it. I hear you. That's weird one two three

608
01:38:39,819 --> 01:38:42,310
Easy

609
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:43,829
Honestly, whoa

610
01:38:43,829 --> 01:38:46,149
Honestly, I don't know why people would have trouble with that

611
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:59,260
Like I don't know why anyone would get here and like not be able to do that first try one two

612
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,989
three

613
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:08,859
Okay

614
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:17,149
Keep going

615
01:39:18,069 --> 01:39:25,270
Wow, all you had to do is let go I was freaking out. Can you put down a everybody close their eyes flag?

616
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:35,880
I don't see anything right now. What um, how high can we jump?

617
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:41,640
We got to jump up to the right one then to the left one. Can we make that? Yeah, I'm here

618
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:53,060
Yeah, I don't know about that one. These do I what's over here?

619
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,199
nothing, oh

620
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:58,649
Where does that go? Oh, let's jump on it. Oh

621
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:11,670
Jeepers how in tarnation did you get up here? It must have been a tough journey. Am I right kids?

622
01:40:12,229 --> 01:40:17,670
The seal by golly. It ain't mine, but we are closer than two catfish in a skillet

623
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:20,630
Now her name is Gertrude. How would I know?

624
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:27,279
This guy's a fucking nobody

625
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:36,090
That timing is not right. Can you pull me up?

626
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:57,319
You pull me up. I mean, let's just try it

627
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:02,199
Yeah, the worst that happens is we fall and we built in timing just back up here to the right

628
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:11,970
falling down on that one

629
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:26,609
Like a pro. Okay

630
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,560
Soon as it clicks into the top, we're gonna jump. Yeah, and I'm gonna grab in the right side

631
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:53,460
What the fuck?

632
01:41:55,659 --> 01:42:05,319
There are no stakes anymore

633
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:07,319
Matter

634
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:21,579
You don't don't drop it. Okay, I'm gonna count it down one two three

635
01:42:32,430 --> 01:42:55,479
Close your eyes nice. Oh my accolades my accolades we were a little too underneath

636
01:43:00,619 --> 01:43:02,619
Actually, no grab

637
01:43:03,289 --> 01:43:06,970
No, just call the key to and get us the fuck back up there, please

638
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:34,729
Accolades, okay. We stand on the right side of this thing. We keep bumping our heads two

639
01:43:35,289 --> 01:43:45,800
Three you gotta let you gotta let me go. No, I don't yeah

640
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:51,600
That's all that's all you you gotta let me go. All right, this is built-in timing, but we have to be careful

641
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,199
Okay, this is a jump. Yes, I

642
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:05,390
Get it now, but oh my god, if I put my brain on like a 50 millisecond delay

643
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:11,250
We are perfectly in sync. Those jumps were like jump. Wait jump

644
01:44:11,569 --> 01:44:18,329
Wait jump and it was perfect. Yeah, that's how I that's how you make sure that you can be together

645
01:44:18,329 --> 01:44:23,770
I'm not in timing is when you land you just jump to the next one because you've already landed. Yes

646
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:28,109
That's not what that was

647
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:34,350
Yeah, I know but you're where point five with 50 milliseconds behind any other anyways, okay

648
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:41,699
No, it's more like it's it's more than 50 you do understand that even you talking through discord is coming through

649
01:44:41,699 --> 01:44:46,520
No, it's more than it's more than 50. It's like a half a second. It's like jump

650
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:53,560
Okay, confirm. We've both landed have a cognitive. I understand. Okay now jump. It's not like jump land jump land

651
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:57,680
Yeah, it's it's not that it is not this it is jump boom

652
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:06,060
I didn't know that you were doing that this whole time when you say like built-in timing these things fall

653
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:09,140
It's like okay jump, but you have to get like the jump has to land

654
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:14,609
We have to make sure we've land the jump first, but it only takes that long to know

655
01:45:14,609 --> 01:45:18,609
Yeah, but but here's the thing. I you don't know because that's what you gotta like see it. It'd be like, yes

656
01:45:18,609 --> 01:45:21,329
Okay, we've lined it. Yeah, but you understand that we're doing this together

657
01:45:21,689 --> 01:45:27,010
So we both need to land boom land, but like you have to built-in timing built-in timing

658
01:45:27,569 --> 01:45:31,369
Timing is we we are both landing at the same time already

659
01:45:31,369 --> 01:45:35,569
That's why we don't need to wait for the other person to land because the jump what it's not in timing

660
01:45:36,569 --> 01:45:39,970
Timing is when you land we've done it line the whole time

661
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:48,079
It's there's no you're okay. You're making it sound like it's like land pause land. No

662
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Let's go back go back to the checkpoint. Okay. Now. Let's do it my way

663
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,859
The moment you land we're just immediately going okay

664
01:46:07,699 --> 01:46:14,640
No, but it's fucked up. It's fucked up because yes, it is. Yes. I am do it go back and do it again ready

665
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:22,890
Why were you slow that time because I thought we were doing German time. No, no

666
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:30,600
No, that's not what I said do your time your time. Okay, my time. That's not enough time

667
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:37,680
That's not enough time because like that's you we synchronized with the three two one go and then after that it's automatic time

668
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:43,000
Not pause reps, there's no it's not a pause rep. It's a

669
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:44,880
confirmation

670
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,359
50 milliseconds to make sure we've actually landed

671
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,890
It's it's a confirmation if you jump jump jump jump jump. What if you miss?

672
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:53,630
What if you know, you're gonna make sure you're in a nice spot

673
01:46:53,630 --> 01:47:00,340
We could if you miss you already missed there's no need to stand still and confirm you've missed

674
01:47:00,340 --> 01:47:06,880
It's good. No, it's a confirmation. Okay, so in the future are we doing pause reps or are we doing like gamer reps?

675
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:13,199
What the gamer reps to me is a mistake in a game like look in any other scenario?

676
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:17,939
I would agree with you in a game like this. You have to confer you put something in my eye

677
01:47:17,939 --> 01:47:23,520
What did you do to my eye? All right, you ready? Got him. Got him. Hey. Hey, what the fuck dude? What are you doing?

678
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,340
Are you ready? We're going

679
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:28,520
germapace

680
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:36,479
But we we did not even confirm that that was our different your timing of like go go go go

681
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:41,409
I'm on beats right like

682
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:47,159
I'm on when you actually land is what your needs to occur. You're like

683
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:52,670
No, you gotta be on a tempo. It's gonna be like you're not doing a tempo

684
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:58,229
Say there are it's not a sound thing. It's a visual. I have jumped

685
01:47:58,229 --> 01:48:01,869
I'm like it's as soon as you can jump jump. All right, but here's the jump

686
01:48:02,149 --> 01:48:08,800
All right before you make everybody leave the stream with your with your incessant anger towards me and you're bickering

687
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:12,909
Have we had a problem this whole time? Yes

688
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:17,569
Since when I think that problem has come up several times. We've never fallen our jump

689
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:23,909
That jump was a little bit messed up like here is the first time I noticed it because it's a very clearly these things will

690
01:48:23,949 --> 01:48:30,479
Fall and you need to go across them as quickly as possible German mights who's with me stir Mata

691
01:48:31,039 --> 01:48:33,600
Get in the battlements

692
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:41,359
Shoot the cannons at the stir Mata. All right, you ready? Can we do this and uh, what happened there?

693
01:48:41,359 --> 01:48:43,359
Mr. Super timing mr. Perfect timing

694
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:09,479
What is you're just fuck with me now he's fucking with me I was

695
01:49:11,939 --> 01:49:21,399
Pull me up it's slippery. I okay

696
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:26,960
Automatically did a germapause rep on that one. We didn't have a plan. We didn't have a plan

697
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,960
What do you mean? We we've done this jump sixty times. We didn't we didn't have a plan

698
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:36,619
Fifty percent of the game is this and why did you just jump right there, sir?

699
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:40,180
Because I'm having an aneurysm our fall

700
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:53,420
That was wait that was not us it was

701
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:59,170
No, that was like our toes got stuck. It's because it's slippery

702
01:49:59,949 --> 01:50:02,260
No, that's not what it was

703
01:50:02,539 --> 01:50:09,500
That was like our toes got stuck on the edge and we didn't jump forward pause. I

704
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:15,340
Haven't even been doing that. You're just making it seem like I don't know what I'm doing and that's not exactly anything that happened

705
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:22,220
I think it was very clearly demonstrated exactly what you were doing. I think everyone is seen. We took a poll

706
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:24,659
the germamite

707
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:35,060
Warship has I got a 95% they were on my side. I did pull I speaking of 95% critic reviews

708
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:41,239
Yeah, how about that Diablo 4 season one? How you feeling? You know, let's not you do this is bad

709
01:50:41,239 --> 01:50:43,579
You don't want us to talk about this. We'll be on this like four hours

710
01:50:46,050 --> 01:50:48,050
The second we get on D for it's like it's over

711
01:50:48,810 --> 01:51:09,710
I've read I was reading my chat just get lucky to bring us back over there, please. I can't when I'm dangling

712
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:26,560
Well, we don't we need to come up with a plan. We got a jump here. Oh, we we it's a jump jump

713
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:37,180
Jump, it's weird over jump over them. Oh, that's gonna okay. You gotta land on the platform pal. Uh, I

714
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:40,090
I honestly buster

715
01:51:40,609 --> 01:51:47,520
Hold on a second before you before everybody starts screaming about my accolades. You are the host you are the host

716
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:51,430
You are the host pal. What do you mean pal?

717
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:57,989
Now you listen here buster. Okay

718
01:51:57,989 --> 01:52:02,869
Can we just like act like this is a single-player game and just jump over it like the slow-moving thing?

719
01:52:02,869 --> 01:52:04,869
We can jump on it. You know how to jump on this. Yes

720
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:16,420
What do we go from there? You gotta wait till it gets to the top and jump, right? Oh

721
01:52:18,359 --> 01:52:39,529
Now you listen here buster I was ahead of you. Yeah, where does your loyalty stand? It's important. Are we going?

722
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:45,350
You listen here buster. What was that about? Got it?

723
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:53,449
I see you gotta get to the top of the mountain. Let's say we do don't as we need to establish contact with these other villages

724
01:52:54,010 --> 01:53:10,310
That's not gonna be right. That was totally it. It was not you just hit your head on the side

725
01:53:10,829 --> 01:53:15,229
You didn't jump. No, I got my head stuck on the rope. Don't run it back

726
01:53:15,229 --> 01:53:28,970
I don't think we can even make this jump run it back, dude

727
01:53:29,289 --> 01:53:32,439
You you got we gotta get a look at it first

728
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:40,199
It's it's built-in timing. It's germapause rep built-in timing when it when we lock in left we go

729
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:50,430
Onto the Metroid block. I feel like I've been doing it like that the whole time

730
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,960
built-in what are you oh

731
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:06,960
Windy winds slippery very slippery slippery slippery

732
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:24,899
Just keep going. You see there's like wind up there. Mm-hmm. I'm worried about that. Oh

733
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:27,699
You should be

734
01:54:27,699 --> 01:54:34,079
Okay, it does like pull us. We have to use the wind. What is this? Oh god

735
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:38,970
Once it once it kicks in nice

736
01:54:39,489 --> 01:54:52,109
Let's jump loser loser loser. What's in here secret any secrets in here doesn't look like it. Oh

737
01:54:54,859 --> 01:55:01,300
We can put on different costumes. How did you do that? Oh, we can change our BDSM rope. Oh

738
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:18,989
Pog you got this

739
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:36,029
Okay, just wait wait wait wait once it ends we go once that's just just anchor and then once that once the next one ends

740
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:43,750
Um, hold on like I have been like hands been like this on the arrow keys the whole time on my right hand

741
01:55:44,149 --> 01:56:03,960
Okay next also. We didn't really talk about that either

742
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,960
Okay, anchor. We didn't talk about that either

743
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:13,079
I'm using my right hand to play this game. You're using your left hand. You're used to your left. I'm being used

744
01:56:13,079 --> 01:56:21,439
I got your anchor. Just keep it. I just keep it anchored. Think about that. I am NOT doing WASD because I can't

745
01:56:23,539 --> 01:56:31,119
Just anchor we need upper. Yeah, we're gonna need to do a spin jump. Why am I getting question-marked? Were you here earlier?

746
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:45,380
Do dude what we need to okay, right? Thank her. I'm I'm

747
01:56:45,939 --> 01:56:50,140
What is this about a left hand that you can't your brain?

748
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:55,859
Can't go to your fingers in your right arm isn't you aren't you right hands dominant muscle memory is?

749
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:01,779
You're on you you're using WASD with your left hand. That is what you are used to using when you play a video game

750
01:57:01,899 --> 01:57:07,939
I'm your right hand being on arrow keys is a different muscle memory. Can I give you like a word of advice?

751
01:57:08,659 --> 01:57:13,439
No, can you put your left hand on the arrow keys?

752
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:17,960
But that's weird because like I'm crossing my body and then but I feel like turn the kid. That's weird

753
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:28,380
That's weird. Like at that point. I would have to like move my seat. It's weird

754
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:36,380
I mean people get it some of you get it if you get it you get it if you don't then you dumb

755
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:40,899
Wow

756
01:57:41,989 --> 01:57:43,989
All right, you ready Wow

757
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:49,310
Whoa, whoa. I don't know what we're doing. We make that jump

758
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:52,520
I think we go to the bottom unless you want to try to get the top right?

759
01:57:52,840 --> 01:58:06,430
Let's try top right if we fall we fall. Okay, let me get to where you are first though move the keyboard

760
01:58:06,430 --> 01:58:10,739
I don't have that's like I don't have a room to do that

761
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:17,100
Right anchor. We're gonna okay as soon as this next win ends. We're gonna do the big jump

762
01:58:17,659 --> 01:58:22,670
Stop fucking pulling me. Well, what are you doing?

763
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:27,470
I need to get a full rotation so we can jump across. I know but we have to wait till the wind is gone

764
01:58:27,470 --> 01:58:31,069
Yeah, so why do you keep interrupting me because I'm getting the rotations going

765
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:38,470
Okay, you ready? Don't do it. I'm not going to I'm ready cuz I can go while the winds going for some reason

766
01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:45,100
Okay, here we go. It was climb climb. The chatter said you could climb

767
01:58:45,739 --> 01:58:50,539
Hold it. Hold hold hold. Oh

768
01:58:50,539 --> 01:59:07,000
We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. We're gonna go left left. Just wait. Just wait. Oh back of all he fell off

769
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:13,279
He's doing

770
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:16,539
Get up here. No, it's windy

771
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:25,630
Pull me pull me pull me. Don't go down

772
01:59:26,149 --> 01:59:38,329
Thanks for waiting hon. I see how much compensation I did there. Don't tell me you don't know what I'm doing

773
01:59:54,520 --> 02:00:00,939
What I think we can make that I don't think we I don't go for a run I think, right?

774
02:00:07,729 --> 02:00:25,189
Okay, we got we gotta remember we gotta double jump up the hill. Yes, you've gone. Yep. Oh

775
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:29,909
You're so greedy I was just you I

776
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:39,359
Can greedy oh dude, it's been it's been like so much fun. How long we've been playing this game for? Oh, wow, like 16 hours

777
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:47,000
so greedy

778
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:55,439
once it ends

779
02:01:02,659 --> 02:01:06,260
I freaked out you freak out sometimes too. We freak out sometimes

780
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:14,399
Everyone is a little freak out. That's usually you time it. I'm just gonna go back

781
02:01:15,479 --> 02:01:17,479
Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, just go back

782
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:20,470
You you've timed it the last few times

783
02:01:20,989 --> 02:01:25,800
Once the wind ends, I know but you've done like the din din

784
02:01:27,079 --> 02:01:36,720
Thought you were gonna go for it. Greedy. Greedy

785
02:01:44,800 --> 02:02:02,960
Stay you guys having fun. How you guys doing? You guys having fun? Everybody doing good. I actually read my chat. Oh

786
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:09,680
You're really gonna pull that I don't know what that means

787
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:14,600
What is this I

788
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:20,039
We have to jump with the wind. We gotta jump probably probably and then I have to throw you with the wind

789
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:30,439
That's definitely what this is. Okay. So now I gotta throw you with the wind. Hold on. Let me get in a better spot

790
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:37,590
Okay, wait for the wind. I'm gonna go when it starts to blow in three two. No

791
02:02:38,149 --> 02:02:43,850
Don't tell me no when I'm confident. Don't tell this guy. No

792
02:02:44,170 --> 02:02:56,510
All right, freeze was what did we do? No, you're so sassy. I

793
02:02:57,569 --> 02:02:59,569
Think that we jump on this platform

794
02:03:00,170 --> 02:03:03,460
Nah

795
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:07,060
Hold on. Okay, we need to see how long it was gonna stay there for

796
02:03:07,579 --> 02:03:14,489
Why we thought six times? Oh, it's to get one more rotation

797
02:03:15,489 --> 02:03:17,289
I'm not I don't feel comfortable about this

798
02:03:17,289 --> 02:03:21,729
But you don't you want to get it right or do you want to get it wrong and I have people omega low and have a

799
02:03:22,210 --> 02:03:37,970
Thumbnail pull me up. Hey, is your refrigerator running? Yeah, I think so you got me

800
02:03:37,970 --> 02:03:50,770
I have to throw you I gotta throw you to that in the wind

801
02:03:50,770 --> 02:03:55,140
You got to grab it and then we got to go. What the fuck just happened. Are you ready?

802
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:02,229
One more I

803
02:04:02,229 --> 02:04:07,569
Won this thing moves in the wind. I don't think I'm gonna be able to keep my momentum. Yeah, that kills it

804
02:04:07,989 --> 02:04:15,460
So you're gonna start when we're on our way to the left. I can't like I'm we're not gonna be able to get 360s

805
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:27,590
But the wind will take us further. Okay, so right now I think it's like that. All right, it's the Lakita up there

806
02:04:28,130 --> 02:04:44,279
Yeah, this is ruining my morning. You both suck. What what's going on?

807
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:57,239
Wait, what do you mean? Where are you? Where are you? All right ready? I'm like exhausted

808
02:04:58,039 --> 02:05:01,119
I've been pushed to my limit

809
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:08,899
All right now I'm gonna swing you ready one more

810
02:05:09,399 --> 02:05:24,180
No, okay one more. I gripped it. But why did that happen? I actually gripped it and he just went I hurt

811
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:26,180
I heard it that does happen sometimes

812
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:30,380
That's why you need the lucky to look Lakota. I

813
02:05:30,899 --> 02:05:32,460
Grew the yoko

814
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:38,720
We're gonna instantly go instantly. That would be better as soon as it comes down. Yep

815
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:51,239
So how we need more momentum on this one? How do we get it? Because if I do it there, it won't work

816
02:05:51,600 --> 02:06:03,079
There we go. Give me one more. Give me one more one more. You got it. My fingers fell off the muscle fucking man

817
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:10,479
We're good. We landed. Oh my god. Why did we both just not do anything? That's not where we're going, right?

818
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:16,760
That's not where we're going

819
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,760
Because we we've been

820
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:28,890
Alright, let me get it two more one more right there

821
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:32,890
All right

822
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:38,060
There you go, I can't I can't

823
02:06:38,819 --> 02:06:41,770
We're gonna jump when the wind comes. Yep. Oh

824
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:49,350
No, no, no. Oh

825
02:06:49,909 --> 02:06:51,909
Let's just walk the other way

826
02:06:52,270 --> 02:06:54,270
But we didn't see what was up there

827
02:06:54,829 --> 02:07:03,939
You were gonna fall off too. You were gonna fall the fuck off you if I didn't fall you're so happy that I felt

828
02:07:06,939 --> 02:07:12,539
It's just gotten worse and you think we'd get better at this shit. Let me just take a look and see what my hand looks like

829
02:07:12,539 --> 02:07:14,779
Oh boy, that's uh

830
02:07:15,659 --> 02:07:17,619
That's not good

831
02:07:17,619 --> 02:07:37,770
What is not good? I did a thing. That's millennial humor, which both Millennials. Okay. Sorry

832
02:07:38,449 --> 02:07:46,939
Next one. Yeah, one wasn't right. Give me two more. Ah

833
02:07:49,699 --> 02:08:02,989
Thank you. All right. All right next win starts. So we're just gonna go go go go go. Mm-hmm. Okay, you got it

834
02:08:09,239 --> 02:08:11,760
Jesus. All right. Now I gotta throw you over there

835
02:08:18,180 --> 02:08:19,859
Jesus, okay

836
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:30,399
This is further than you thought we'd get right 270. I I thought we I thought we were gonna quit the game like an hour

837
02:08:30,399 --> 02:08:36,800
And a half ago. All right. What's the plan here? Let's jump. Uh, yeah

838
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,600
I can we make I don't know

839
02:08:46,439 --> 02:08:48,739
I think we do the running one

840
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:51,100
the other side

841
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:58,939
Nice, uh, and then when the wind starts, we're gonna have to do a jump. Yep

842
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:11,739
Whoa, I overshot it the first time

843
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:17,579
Let's jump straight up

844
02:09:17,579 --> 02:09:20,659
Can we make the left one? I gotta wait for the wind

845
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:22,470
Oops

846
02:09:22,470 --> 02:09:24,750
Are you doing as soon as the wind hits?

847
02:09:25,310 --> 02:09:32,819
You fucked it up. I you didn't jump. I did they didn't but I was pulling you I was pulling you it's like off

848
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:40,520
Sink it's weird when I fall. It's my fault when you fall. It's weird a full straight run

849
02:09:40,920 --> 02:10:01,779
No, when the wind starts when the wind starts, I just straight up straight up when the wind starts

850
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:20,890
All right, you grabbing or am I grabbing I think we can make the job grab

851
02:10:21,250 --> 02:10:36,909
Okay, I'll grab these I'll grab it you grab the other one. Okay, let go here. Oh fuck. Yep

852
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:39,229
Good thing you were a little bit further

853
02:10:39,229 --> 02:10:44,609
All right. What's the plan here? I guess it's that

854
02:10:51,430 --> 02:10:52,909
What

855
02:10:52,909 --> 02:11:03,489
Troll dumb just get us back. What what what?

856
02:11:05,989 --> 02:11:07,149

857
02:11:07,149 --> 02:11:10,970
Sounds good

858
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:21,659
Double jump does it blow with the wind? I think we got it

859
02:11:21,659 --> 02:11:23,659
We got to do it when it's above our head

860
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:30,810
No shit, that's weird

861
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:34,770
What the heck? I got you. I got you baby boo-boo

862
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:46,720
Can you pull me up? I keep swinging. I don't trust that. No, I'm the swinger

863
02:11:47,479 --> 02:11:53,800
Okay, I'm gonna go right when we oh, no, I think you have to start doing it down here

864
02:11:54,279 --> 02:11:57,760
Yeah, cuz the winds gonna mess it up

865
02:11:57,760 --> 02:12:02,600
It's my hitting my head on the corner is what it is. I'm gonna move to the right a little more. I got it

866
02:12:04,609 --> 02:12:09,039
No

867
02:12:09,039 --> 02:12:11,039
Let me move to the right a little bit more

868
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:19,119
See if that does it. Mm-hmm. I've got it. Trust trust. Okay

869
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:32,579
I'm gonna go on this one. Okay. Oh

870
02:12:34,069 --> 02:12:35,350
No, what?

871
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:45,359
Go jump anchor

872
02:12:47,039 --> 02:12:49,039
anchor in this stanker

873
02:13:05,939 --> 02:13:10,539
That was kind of like a I just I'm piecing together what you just said

874
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:12,979
Going on this one

875
02:13:12,979 --> 02:13:15,159
We're gonna go gotta go gotta go gotta go gotta go

876
02:13:20,869 --> 02:13:38,029
Okay after the wind. Yeah, we should get a countdown there pink for the clouds purple for the mountains. Uh-huh

877
02:13:38,029 --> 02:13:39,909
I'm starting to visualize it

878
02:13:39,909 --> 02:13:47,909
They're actually like it's hard to climb this and there's so many people up here solo. I don't like that lore

879
02:13:48,430 --> 02:13:56,439
How much further is coming? I wonder come here for a run and jump

880
02:13:56,880 --> 02:14:05,319
Wait, we need the wind and also it seems like if you stand behind this wall, the wind doesn't affect you. Oh

881
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:07,380
It doesn't

882
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:12,210
Wait, I didn't I know that was weird start at late. So I decided to call it

883
02:14:12,810 --> 02:14:17,939
Okay, when the wind starts I called it. Yeah

884
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:24,489
You're for the best. You're not even on the ground. I got it. I got it again. I got it. All right

885
02:14:24,489 --> 02:14:33,300
I thought we may have kept moving not risking it

886
02:14:33,739 --> 02:14:38,640
All right, so you grab and then you want me to grab the other side of the wall? Yeah

887
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:43,840
Right now mid wind

888
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:51,750
I'm not you're grabbing right you go you go. Yeah. All right. I'm going to grab the other side

889
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:03,720
What that was a buggy bug bug that was a bug bug bug that was a bug that was a bug it was a bug

890
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:26,489
I was a bug. That was that was a bug. That's a bug. I wasn't even holding on to the side. Just go second one. Okay, I

891
02:15:27,489 --> 02:15:29,489
Let's wait for this

892
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:32,930
Platform go

893
02:15:32,930 --> 02:15:39,289
But do it good. Yeah, but dude, it's the first try. Don't worry Lakitu's bringing us right back. Oh first try

894
02:15:39,289 --> 02:15:43,329
We're up 250 meters this mountain first try. We've never done this before

895
02:15:43,329 --> 02:15:45,689
I was concerned that if I was gonna throw you too far

896
02:15:46,289 --> 02:16:00,329
You fucking dunce. That's not a dunce scenario. That's uh, you

897
02:16:00,970 --> 02:16:04,899
You didn't even anchor. I'm the dunce

898
02:16:05,739 --> 02:16:08,680
You got up there and you stood there

899
02:16:09,479 --> 02:16:14,680
I'm the dunce. I'm the dunce though. You're gonna let go of the wall. You didn't anchor

900
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:20,479

901
02:16:20,479 --> 02:16:26,750

We've done you dunce. Okay, I've got it this one got this one, but it dunce you've done

904
02:16:39,819 --> 02:16:41,819

Mm-hmm. We got this fast. This is easy. They're nice. Nice job dunce. I'm gonna let this one go

906
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:10,559
We jump straight up swing up we swing up we jump up watch that wind nice job watching the wind

907
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:13,600

Thanks, dude, feel bad. I was gonna say moron, but he didn't deserve it. Wait, we need wind

910
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:47,600
Are you gonna make that jump without wind you're doing the countdown

911
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:50,360
That doesn't mean you jump

912
02:17:50,360 --> 02:18:03,729
He's doing the countdown this countdown. This countdown is real. Oh, you don't need it. That was slippery

913
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:06,790
It sure was buster

914
02:18:07,329 --> 02:18:09,329
We need a much bigger running start

915
02:18:23,639 --> 02:18:33,729
Dunce and duncer

916
02:18:34,569 --> 02:18:41,799
Stay there. All right. Yeah, we need a

Okay, just chill here but and we're gonna double jump. Yeah, wait, no, we're not what are you

918
02:18:54,569 --> 02:18:58,670

02:19:00,030 --> 02:19:05,069
Said no, we're not and then got angry when I didn't go we're gonna jump to this one

920
02:19:05,069 --> 02:19:25,049
But then we're gonna stop there because we need to swing. Yes, we're too big. We'll jump. Yes, we do. I got it

921
02:19:25,170 --> 02:19:34,389
What are you doing? Okay

922
02:19:36,030 --> 02:19:38,969
That just fucked us up a little more

923
02:19:39,209 --> 02:19:53,500
Okay, can you get us back up? Where's the key to how do I call them?

924
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:05,159
Let's just just just just just jump just jump

925
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:16,120

928
02:20:44,850 --> 02:20:46,850

929
02:20:46,930 --> 02:20:53,559
Okay, we're good. We're gonna we we got to jump up to the left and then

930
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:59,069
Just be aware. We're gonna have to jump up to the left and then like get a little bit of a run. Yep

931
02:20:59,569 --> 02:21:04,629
So all all the way over. Okay, let's I'll count it. I'll count it down

932
02:21:04,709 --> 02:21:07,229
If we need to count it because we're connected to each other at the hip

933
02:21:09,819 --> 02:21:16,010
God, I wish we weren't or were okay. That was always cuz it was because we're good. That's time

934
02:21:16,010 --> 02:21:19,530
It was in time, right? I did it. It just didn't do it

935
02:21:28,159 --> 02:21:35,350
It's fucking hard. Okay, just just chill just chill. It's gonna blow us off

936
02:21:37,750 --> 02:21:40,549
Walk again stay you can't it blows you off

Yeah

944
02:22:15,430 --> 02:22:18,020
If we don't do it this time, it's red

945
02:22:19,739 --> 02:22:29,180
Hey, you fell off you fell off because you decided to anchor instead of walking to the right on the ice

946
02:22:29,180 --> 02:22:31,379
Can you say Barney loud for me?

947
02:22:33,459 --> 02:22:35,829

Barney Barney Barney

949
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:48,059
Different I think um, we gotta get back up to the top red. This is not even hard. We've done way harder things

950
02:22:48,620 --> 02:22:58,059
Pretty good. Yeah, just wait. We've got the road. We're rushing through this. No, we're not

951
02:22:58,459 --> 02:23:12,139
We're you the wind once it starts do not anchor on ice, but sometimes it gives you an extra little boost. No

952
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:14,540
No

953
02:23:14,540 --> 02:23:33,930

But here is the conundrum you are you are way ahead of me. Do you get it now?

960
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:37,079
No, because I'm throwing you bro. I'm throwing you I think we could just make this jump to the right

961
02:24:37,639 --> 02:24:53,280
Yeah, when I throw you you are like a full you're a full rope length ahead of me

962
02:24:53,700 --> 02:25:10,389
All right, so we're gonna read a full fully documented plan. I'm sending you the email right now. Okay, what's what's in it?

963
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:18,549
It's a subject keep going. Just keep walking right don't anchor on ice

02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:54,489
With the window we have how much more time do you need but I'm just trying to figure out if it's with the window

969
02:25:54,489 --> 02:25:56,489
I feel like I'm gonna go flying past

970
02:25:57,010 --> 02:25:59,010
Oh bother

971
02:26:18,770 --> 02:26:24,850
Regular job, let's wait for the wind

972
02:26:26,090 --> 02:26:32,850
Uh-huh. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow

973
02:26:34,170 --> 02:26:36,469

02:27:38,139 --> 02:27:44,040
What's the fucking family are running right once the wind hits? Oh

982
02:27:45,079 --> 02:27:53,170
Right. I don't know. What do we do there? I think we're doing it wrong

983
02:28:00,610 --> 02:28:02,649
We can both jump and grab the wall, ah

984
02:28:03,729 --> 02:28:10,000
But why?

985
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:20,899
So that's the thing the floor doesn't break when the wind comes when the wind comes now. Well, it'll respawn. Oh

986
02:28:21,540 --> 02:28:23,500
What a smart?

987
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:27,319
You got it. Just

988
02:28:27,319 --> 02:28:32,000
We got a smart ass over here. You are kind of a no, you're not you're fine

989
02:28:32,639 --> 02:28:45,870
no, I

990
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:50,989
Know but I just thought of like the grimace birth thing again, and it's like fuck with me

991
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:58,129
Month-long

992
02:28:58,129 --> 02:29:00,770
What's up? It's I don't even know what to say

993
02:29:01,450 --> 02:29:20,049
Okay, say less. Is this a throw scenario? Yeah, I'm gonna move up a little no actually we're good. No

994
02:29:20,709 --> 02:29:24,700
Right keep walking, right?

995
02:29:24,700 --> 02:29:38,030
Keep walking, right? I am I am. Oh, I don't know what you did. I forgot to give the second instruction

996
02:29:38,729 --> 02:30:05,280
Stop walking, right? Hey, what if I threw him right now? I forgot to give the second instruction stop walking, right? Yeah, I

997
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:11,260
Okay, so let's like just like pause when we're on the ice because apparently we're doing a lot of germa pause reps

998
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:14,860
I love how this all comes back to me doing this somehow

999
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:23,340
but

1000
02:30:23,340 --> 02:30:24,540
pause

1001
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:35,469
nice

1002
02:30:35,469 --> 02:30:37,290
Smooth

1003
02:30:37,290 --> 02:30:38,450
Smooth

1004
02:30:38,450 --> 02:30:48,260
No, no, no, no the winds are Howard Howard Howard. We would have gotten going on Howard Howard Howard

1005
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:52,290
It says three two one go. That's when you go

1006
02:30:52,930 --> 02:30:56,840
Give it a second. We don't do well that

1007
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:00,530
Did you shave your eyebrows?

1008
02:31:00,530 --> 02:31:06,049
No, I probably need to I probably need to do some cleanup on my eyebrows though. They're probably fucking filthy

1009
02:31:17,959 --> 02:31:21,959
One of us to get it. I want to hear I want to hear it. Don't talk. We're gonna do this. Oh

1010
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:41,700
Let go

1011
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:44,110
That's a lot of talking

1012
02:31:44,110 --> 02:31:59,020
Okay. Okay. I hate this. I hate this. We're going back. This is totally an optional room. I

1013
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:09,020
Don't think it is. I think it is. I think we're waiting for the wind here to jump left. Okay, you say so

1014
02:32:09,659 --> 02:32:21,229
I'm gonna do a trick. Where do we go from? Oh

1015
02:32:21,950 --> 02:32:26,229
There's gonna be a tough one. It is

1016
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:29,420
We just wait for the wind and I just do it normally

1017
02:32:30,020 --> 02:33:07,489
Like this dance you goober we got an achievement for that. Yeah. Yeah, how do we both miss that?

1018
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Call the taxi, whatever it is

1019
02:33:14,129 --> 02:33:21,180
Hey me Lords, have you tried waiting for each other to jump you have a dent in your head?

1020
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:29,799
Was that you reading a comment cuz I thought you were responding to that person I was like that

1021
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:32,040
He wouldn't usually go in like that

1022
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:35,360
Thought you meant that was you thought I was talking to you

1023
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:41,319
No, what you read the comment the guy said why don't you try waiting to jump and you were just like hey

1024
02:33:41,319 --> 02:33:49,180
You got a dent in your head. I didn't realize it was a back-to-back comment

1025
02:33:51,940 --> 02:33:54,780
That's true that sounded so fucked up that was

1026
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:10,719
Okay

1027
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:14,700
The our continuation of the let's play

1028
02:34:17,739 --> 02:34:19,739
Okay, ready. Yeah

1029
02:34:21,799 --> 02:34:27,239
Trashing he's turning purple. Where's my countdown? Oh

1030
02:34:30,059 --> 02:34:34,350
Sensory overload the winds not even here you don't

1031
02:34:35,510 --> 02:34:39,110
Sensory over and stop my fault. There's too many noises

1032
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:46,719
Death in your head

1033
02:34:47,159 --> 02:34:51,260
Hold on fucking rude. That's so fucking like horrible

1034
02:34:52,680 --> 02:35:00,860
Why can't we do this anymore? I think we got a jump a little later. Oh

1035
02:35:01,540 --> 02:35:05,000
We're like, we're being very conservative with our jump

1036
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:20,780
Okay, we said how is your hair middle and side parted?

1037
02:35:24,040 --> 02:35:28,200
Get it. I don't get it. You got a dent in your head. I don't know maybe

1038
02:35:28,879 --> 02:35:34,420
Is it is it? I can't I need to look I got I got it. I got it

1039
02:35:34,940 --> 02:35:43,079
Hold hold hold hold here. You stop. Um, stop fucking around

1040
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:49,079
What do you mean stop fucking around? You just fell off twice and you've been around so much. Stop you fucking around

1041
02:35:49,079 --> 02:35:57,530
It's I'm the spinner. Yeah, but we need to assess what's going on with this situation ahead of us. There is a

1042
02:35:58,370 --> 02:36:04,340
Okay, I get it. You're ready. I've been ready. I wasn't though and it's a team game

1043
02:36:06,559 --> 02:36:08,559
It's a team game and I wasn't

1044
02:36:12,590 --> 02:36:20,120
I didn't think we were gonna make it. I can't believe you did the tutorial of red dead 2 and just be like this game's dumb

1045
02:36:20,120 --> 02:36:23,899
I didn't finish it. I just saved your life

1046
02:36:24,540 --> 02:36:30,399
Well, we should have double jumped why we don't just went cuz we're on a fucking time limit

1047
02:36:30,899 --> 02:36:50,379
Go go. Oh, this is it. We're almost the end. What are you doing? All right

1048
02:36:50,940 --> 02:36:57,280
You'd like the ghost took over the computer for a second. What are you doing? I was wondering if that was affecting you

1049
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:03,790
Huh, I was adjusting my music volume. Oh, I turned it way down already

1050
02:37:11,530 --> 02:37:14,670
Three two one go I bumped my head on it

1051
02:37:15,790 --> 02:37:23,260
Yeah, gaga Google. Oh you want to go? No. No, you said stay in our lanes, right?

1052
02:37:23,260 --> 02:37:32,559
Like do what we know what we're doing with the without it's definitely without or is it is it with or without?

1053
02:37:33,399 --> 02:37:35,000
it's with

1054
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:41,819
Wait, it might not be I guess it is. Okay

1055
02:37:42,459 --> 02:37:47,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, pull me up. Pull me up. I'm a little baby

1056
02:37:48,649 --> 02:37:50,799
Yeah, oh

1057
02:37:50,799 --> 02:37:55,520
I see you want to put a checkpoint after every jump now because you want to be done with this game that you despise so

1058
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:58,170
much I

1059
02:37:58,170 --> 02:38:05,520
Get you. Yep. Holy shit. Okay. Well because look at you

1060
02:38:06,139 --> 02:38:11,459
Look at you look in the mirror. You're I wouldn't be able to finish this one you ever

1061
02:38:12,139 --> 02:38:18,940
I'm looking in the mirror. What is it something my face? What's what my fucking hair? I have the double part. What's going on?

1062
02:38:18,940 --> 02:38:30,200
I think we could practice this game for an eternity and without checkpoints. It would never end. Uh,

1063
02:38:31,979 --> 02:38:41,280
I felt the same way by the game only up and it was so hard and then I started watching people do like

1064
02:38:42,520 --> 02:38:47,079
15 minutes speed runs of that game and yet that was on you that was I don't know where we're going after that

1065
02:38:47,600 --> 02:39:03,350
Tbh, whoa, that was weird. I've been comparing only up to dark and darker and I can see how you would like them both

1066
02:39:03,590 --> 02:39:10,370
What what do you mean explain I don't think I should

1067
02:39:12,719 --> 02:39:15,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1068
02:39:15,639 --> 02:39:43,170
What do you mean explain? Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. They're both unfinished streamer bait trash. Okay, it's been in the wrong way

1069
02:39:43,170 --> 02:39:57,950
All right, just hold tight on me up. Okay. Now, where we going against the wind when it comes go left

1070
02:39:58,469 --> 02:40:01,280
Nice. Okay. Okay

1071
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:11,360
Okay, um, I mean but can I ask you a question? Yeah, and you have to answer honestly

1072
02:40:12,040 --> 02:40:17,600
Mm-hmm. Can you name me three games that have come out in the last five years that you genuinely really enjoyed?

1073
02:40:19,360 --> 02:40:21,360
Yeah, what what are they?

1074
02:40:23,229 --> 02:40:30,760
Without looking up a like Google sheet of the game. I'm trying to look up something else. Did you play bet and brutal? No

1075
02:40:32,030 --> 02:40:35,870
Exactly. I rest my case

1076
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:42,629
Drama Oh only up. I love only up. I'm gonna check out the speedruns. Oh and if these die play bet and brutal

1077
02:40:42,629 --> 02:40:46,159
No, I played only up for like four hours once

1078
02:40:47,479 --> 02:40:52,819
Exactly. I didn't when did I say that only up was the game of the year? I said

1079
02:40:54,540 --> 02:40:59,260
I said like like I said named a few games in the last five years that you genuinely enjoyed

1080
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:03,620
In the last five years. Yeah name like three

1081
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:09,559
Do they have to have released in the last five years or can I enjoy them? Yeah, like a game that's come a games

1082
02:41:09,559 --> 02:41:11,559
I've come out in the last like let's say three years

1083
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:16,360
That you like really would like wow, I really enjoyed that you got to name me at least three

1084
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:23,270
Elden ring Q remastered risk of rain to

1085
02:41:24,629 --> 02:41:33,450
Yep, I don't you can't which light infinite. You told me in private that you didn't like it. Didn't like what or tight I didn't

1086
02:41:37,739 --> 02:41:41,260
You're you're weird. Can I tell you why you're weird? Why am I weird?

1087
02:41:41,260 --> 02:41:45,899
Cuz you'll like okay, I brought up like pizza tower, right? Yeah, and I was like pizza tower

1088
02:41:45,899 --> 02:41:48,459
Oh, you should really try it. I think it's like one of the best games to come out this year

1089
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:52,479
And you played it and you were like don't ever recommend me a game ever again

1090
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:57,899
That's not what I said. I just said I it wasn't for me. I

1091
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:01,700
respect

1092
02:42:01,700 --> 02:42:08,250
Pizza tower, but it is not for me. Okay, it may have been more

1093
02:42:09,649 --> 02:42:17,200
He was a little dramatic at the time. Well, hey, hey, why we're gonna have this whole conversation when I brought up Diablo 4 season 1

1094
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:20,909
Early, you know, you didn't want to talk then. Oh, it was just a hater

1095
02:42:24,069 --> 02:42:28,750
Beloved game but love Diablo for the one of the greatest entries in the Diablo series pull up

1096
02:42:28,750 --> 02:42:29,950
Oh, you want to talk about it?

1097
02:42:29,950 --> 02:42:37,299
I just got really sick and tired of picking up Saigon's boots over and over and over again

1098
02:42:37,819 --> 02:42:41,600
You fucking wish that game would drop Saigon's boots. Yeah

1099
02:42:59,459 --> 02:43:08,950
Stir has horrid opinions. I don't think stir is horrid opinions stir and I actually agree on quite a lot chat

1100
02:43:09,069 --> 02:43:14,350
You're dying on the hill of only up a game that's getting fucking like destroyed for like

1101
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:21,149
Non-fair use NFT shit in their game. You're dying on the hill of like no only up was good. What do you mean?

1102
02:43:21,149 --> 02:43:26,549
It's fun. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. The game was fun. I enjoyed I enjoyed it

1103
02:43:26,549 --> 02:43:32,909
But the counterpoint is Ben brutal is the exact same game without all of the shovelware aspects

1104
02:43:32,909 --> 02:43:35,350
But you didn't try that and you tried the shovelware

1105
02:43:35,829 --> 02:43:45,329
That's all I'm saying nobody died on that hill you're fighting ghosts you're fighting ghosts

1106
02:43:46,790 --> 02:43:50,110
You're fighting ghosts. I'm just saying

1107
02:43:51,069 --> 02:43:56,639
two very similar games came out in a very similar time frame and

1108
02:43:57,709 --> 02:44:01,510
One of them deserves a an ounce of respect and you picked the wrong one

1109
02:44:02,350 --> 02:44:05,170
Let me I'll translate for those of you that don't know stir

1110
02:44:06,030 --> 02:44:08,909
He fell off the pipes and all dead for it get good

1111
02:44:09,430 --> 02:44:13,190
This is the I fell off the pipes and didn't want to go back up

1112
02:44:15,860 --> 02:44:25,799
This is drama destroying the environment by supporting. Okay, you ready? Okay, let's go. I

1113
02:44:29,479 --> 02:44:31,399
Forgot to press down

1114
02:44:31,399 --> 02:44:49,360
Three two. No, wait, I was good. You were watching my stream. I wasn't even on camera next time. It touches down. Yep. Nice

1115
02:44:50,159 --> 02:44:53,040
Next time it touches up. We're running, right? Oh

1116
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:58,559
Oh, I quit in favelas

1117
02:44:59,399 --> 02:45:03,850
I'm here with you. I'm tied to you. I'm good playing it

1118
02:45:04,290 --> 02:45:08,889
What ever happened to next time it goes when it goes we're in the middle of we're in the middle of like a divorce

1119
02:45:08,969 --> 02:45:12,590
Level argument right now. So I need a second next time

1120
02:45:13,770 --> 02:45:16,170
My fingers left. Oh my

1121
02:45:16,889 --> 02:45:25,420
Three, what's all I got like oil on my fingers. What happened? Yeah when you're focusing on pulling me only up

1122
02:45:26,780 --> 02:45:31,379
He liked it the next time we touched up

1123
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:35,719
You didn't do it

1124
02:45:35,719 --> 02:45:41,600
You were never gonna make that jump and you're counting on me to have made the jump so that you don't look dumb

1125
02:45:46,090 --> 02:46:01,850
This kid didn't even make it up pipes and only up it's also about season one. Let's hear about it

1126
02:46:03,930 --> 02:46:16,319
I gotta I guess I'm gonna be I you breaking up. Are you on a good cell signal? You breaking up? Yeah name five games

1127
02:46:18,129 --> 02:46:22,909
Super Mario 1 Super Mario 2 Super Mario World Super Mario 3 Super Mario 64

1128
02:46:23,909 --> 02:46:27,809
Best games of all time. Not even a fucking contention

1129
02:46:28,389 --> 02:46:42,510
Competition. Did you beat Super Mario World for SNES? Yes. Thank God actually. Thank God actually

1130
02:46:43,190 --> 02:46:47,540
Let's move that flag

1131
02:46:50,540 --> 02:47:00,420
Next time it touches down. I got you. I got you. I got you. I made it

1132
02:47:03,819 --> 02:47:16,600
Did you see the Mario fingers are just so oily it was funny when I did it and why are we counting now?

1133
02:47:17,020 --> 02:47:20,420
You did it. You did it. Are we counting you?

1134
02:47:21,100 --> 02:47:25,600
Stir he got that. There's a bird. That sounds like there's a bird in your room

1135
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:27,899
I don't know if I heard what I heard was correct, but be careful out there

1136
02:47:27,899 --> 02:47:38,579
I heard a very large bird potentially you all right you there duck. All right, you're gonna comes down crouch

1137
02:47:39,379 --> 02:47:41,750
Next time we go up. I'm gonna count it down

1138
02:47:42,549 --> 02:47:45,170
My fingers are greasy

1139
02:47:45,409 --> 02:47:50,889
You didn't even go on look and look what I'm doing here. Look what I'm doing. I see what you're doing

1140
02:47:50,889 --> 02:47:56,340
I certainly see what you're doing. Okay. What's the plan here?

1141
02:47:59,409 --> 02:48:01,409
I know and

1142
02:48:01,569 --> 02:48:04,799
We come back. Yeah

1143
02:48:04,799 --> 02:48:11,520
We need we need one of these two. You can't put them here. Yeah put them on ice. Okay, so we need running start to

1144
02:48:12,399 --> 02:48:17,629
Okay

1145
02:48:17,629 --> 02:48:23,299
Okay, I like how we both just sit so we're going right pop right pop

1146
02:48:25,079 --> 02:48:37,510
After the next wind we're beating this. I thought you were gonna do a countdown

1147
02:48:38,819 --> 02:48:40,579
After the next wind

1148
02:48:40,579 --> 02:48:47,350
Can you jump could you know you pull me? Hey, you know, you're not doing the pole animation

1149
02:48:47,950 --> 02:49:00,040
Sorry, there's no signal in the tunnel. Okay, I guess I'll count it down for you

1150
02:49:00,639 --> 02:49:10,159
Nice whoo

1151
02:49:10,639 --> 02:49:17,620
All right, what the heck once it gets here? Yeah

1152
02:49:18,459 --> 02:49:20,510
Then we can go

1153
02:49:20,510 --> 02:49:32,120
Up and then duck and then I have to throw you to the left. I think I think this is a throw

1154
02:49:32,120 --> 02:49:34,620
I think this might is it a throw

1155
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:41,159
Why not? Why not? Just why not just go all all out you show me your true power. I think it was a throw

1156
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:54,120
It's 500 we're almost there and then then you can go play Diablo 4 so we all know you're fucking huge

1157
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:59,659
You love that game. Well, apparently apparently I like games now

1158
02:50:00,360 --> 02:50:15,110
Apparently I like games now good save actually. I don't know if this gets us anywhere though. I think it kind of does

1159
02:50:15,670 --> 02:50:25,340
Well, we're gonna yeah, we're gonna have to jump next wind I think it makes sense to me

1160
02:50:25,860 --> 02:50:38,639
Boy, I was going by timing. Why are you guys fighting? Hey, it's good games

1161
02:50:40,329 --> 02:50:42,569
only up stir and I

1162
02:50:43,129 --> 02:50:47,739
Are very comfortable hanging out. We can just you know rifle off

1163
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:53,700
Yeah, we I think we have a pretty good dynamic. We've known each other for a long time. I think we have a good dynamic

1164
02:50:53,700 --> 02:50:59,989
What do you think crap? That's it? Yes. Yeah, we have a great dynamic

1165
02:51:00,750 --> 02:51:03,120
We have a great dynamic

1166
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:09,840
We know we know who is who we know who's wearing the fucking shoes in the relationship pants

1167
02:51:10,360 --> 02:51:14,840
That why what are you counting down?

1168
02:51:15,159 --> 02:51:20,010
What were you counting down? What were you doing? You knew that was a bad countdown

1169
02:51:20,329 --> 02:51:25,530
The next jump timed perfectly after the wind ended you knew that was a bad countdown

1170
02:51:25,530 --> 02:51:28,729
That was a view that you timed that wrong and you knew it. That's why you quiet

1171
02:51:28,729 --> 02:51:34,110
Usually you'd have been like turbo you're stupid it but that time you were dead silent because I thought

1172
02:51:34,809 --> 02:51:37,010
We've been doing this for like 14 hours

1173
02:51:37,770 --> 02:51:51,450
You ready on the next wind? Can you can you notice the wind occurring then we can just do it same exact thing?

1174
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:52,809
We did last time

1175
02:51:52,809 --> 02:51:58,959
three two one go

1176
02:52:00,430 --> 02:52:02,430
It wasn't gonna work out that way. Oh

1177
02:52:02,909 --> 02:52:03,790
wasn't

1178
02:52:03,790 --> 02:52:07,309
No, we didn't do it before. I wasn't gonna work out that way

1179
02:52:08,190 --> 02:52:23,920
Bro, take a nap. You look tired. I mean I am but how dare you I think that's cuz we're doing that when the wind comes

1180
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:25,360
I think so

1181
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:28,750
three two one, uh

1182
02:52:30,520 --> 02:52:38,809
Zero, I don't think we need the wind for this. I think you're you're you're putting overwind compensation in here

1183
02:52:38,809 --> 02:52:41,690
I'm putting overwind. Okay, we're the winds gonna end

1184
02:52:41,690 --> 02:52:56,000
I'm gonna count it down and we're gonna definitely just slam right into this wall. Okay, this one's a no-winder

1185
02:52:56,520 --> 02:53:00,239
No, we can't there's no way to no-win. Okay, okay

1186
02:53:00,799 --> 02:53:05,030
This has to be wind. I'm sorry. I had that wrong. Um

1187
02:53:07,059 --> 02:53:18,180
Uh-huh. Can you let go? No

1188
02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:28,500
No, it wasn't actually holding it. Oh, what this weird, right? By the way, dude, I'm uh, I'm I'm

1189
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:32,340
I'm sorry that I got that wrong

1190
02:53:32,989 --> 02:53:38,959
I'm sorry. I had it wrong. It's so fucking hard to do that

1191
02:53:39,520 --> 02:53:41,520
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

1192
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:59,319
Like you I can't apologize. I can't do it. Okay, let's go now. I know this is so itchy dude. I'm sorry

1193
02:54:00,760 --> 02:54:04,719
How did you get to across your room in one second that was weird

1194
02:54:07,700 --> 02:54:16,530
Pull me up so we can fly up there

1195
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:23,139
What do you mean?

1196
02:54:23,139 --> 02:54:42,159
Well, you're supposed to be pressing the fly up there button. Okay. Good. Good. Good

1197
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:44,639
Alright, this is it

1198
02:54:44,639 --> 02:54:46,639
the final 50 meters

1199
02:54:50,840 --> 02:54:54,680
I dare you to read this look another pair of penguins. These guys have to have it

1200
02:54:57,170 --> 02:54:59,090
Hey, good day guys

1201
02:54:59,090 --> 02:55:03,489
Have you brought it? We well, we got all the way here and realized we didn't bring it

1202
02:55:05,540 --> 02:55:07,540
We would have come home as victorious

1203
02:55:08,180 --> 02:55:09,219
heroes

1204
02:55:09,219 --> 02:55:10,420
But no

1205
02:55:10,420 --> 02:55:12,500
They've had to leave the most important thing at home

1206
02:55:13,750 --> 02:55:15,750
Are you going to remind me for the rest of our lives?

1207
02:55:16,389 --> 02:55:19,829
Yes, I will maybe then you won't forget everything. Do you even remember my name?

1208
02:55:20,870 --> 02:55:26,979
So I don't want to read this anymore

1209
02:55:26,979 --> 02:55:27,940
wait

1210
02:55:27,940 --> 02:55:31,729
Come here

1211
02:55:31,729 --> 02:55:34,850
No, shut up. We really I wanted people mad that I skipped it. Shut up

1212
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:38,600
Uh, it looked like a secret in there

1213
02:55:38,680 --> 02:55:42,520
I'm sorry for saying shut up. I didn't mean that

1214
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:46,819
All right, this is it wait

1215
02:55:47,649 --> 02:55:50,399
Oh, you have okay you have one over there

1216
02:55:53,889 --> 02:55:55,430
three

1217
02:55:55,430 --> 02:55:56,819
No

1218
02:55:56,819 --> 02:56:00,100
All right. I gotta throw you I think

1219
02:56:00,100 --> 02:56:03,219
Yep, this is gonna be weird because how are we gonna do this from here?

1220
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:11,250
Do what from here? Like you're gonna have to land and then we have to you have to land right on that snow part on the left

1221
02:56:11,889 --> 02:56:14,520
Otherwise, we're not gonna be able to do it

1222
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:16,520
Just like that. Don't worry. I got it

1223
02:56:17,079 --> 02:56:18,440
On the left

1224
02:56:18,440 --> 02:56:21,479
If you landed on the ice, we would have not been able to do it

1225
02:56:21,639 --> 02:56:26,840
You're gonna throw it all the way to the ice. Yes, there is if you were unskilled like i'm not

1226
02:56:31,350 --> 02:56:34,069
The wind doesn't affect me up here. Yeah, but I don't want to get blown. Okay

1227
02:56:36,319 --> 02:56:38,559
Okay, this this might need like a little bit of a run

1228
02:56:42,629 --> 02:56:44,450
that's

1229
02:56:44,450 --> 02:56:46,129
You had it wrong

1230
02:56:46,129 --> 02:56:48,129
How did I have it wrong? We weren't gonna make that jump

1231
02:56:48,690 --> 02:56:55,989
See that I I should have done the timing on that one

1232
02:56:56,870 --> 02:56:58,870
You haven't done the time. What have you done?

1233
02:56:59,590 --> 02:57:05,270
What have I done? What have you done? You've actually done something very very bad. You've done something. You've done something incredibly bad

1234
02:57:05,750 --> 02:57:09,510
What have I done? I don't know what you did, but you've done something bad and now we have to do that

1235
02:57:09,909 --> 02:57:12,229
It's all right. It's gonna take us right there. What have you done?

1236
02:57:12,950 --> 02:57:18,819
What have I done? I don't know. What have you done? You did something bad. What have I done? What have I done? Okay

1237
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:22,690
It's it's salvageable

1238
02:57:22,690 --> 02:57:24,690
I think it's salvageable. It's salvageable. We just gotta

1239
02:57:25,879 --> 02:57:29,079
Uh, he he is absolutely floundering right now. He's like falling off stuff

1240
02:57:30,079 --> 02:57:32,079
He's in shock. We have to we gotta we gotta

1241
02:57:32,159 --> 02:57:35,200
Jeremy I like games. Okay. Sorry. All right. We're good. No, it's fine. We're good

1242
02:57:39,090 --> 02:57:40,850
Running against the wind. We're okay

1243
02:57:40,850 --> 02:57:44,049
It's okay. It's all right. I'm

1244
02:57:44,129 --> 02:57:45,649
Jeremy what have I done?

1245
02:57:45,649 --> 02:57:52,440
It's everything's gonna be fine. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be all right

1246
02:57:53,079 --> 02:58:01,540
Just take a look. It's only four. We were at 450 440. This is not a problem

1247
02:58:02,500 --> 02:58:05,829
That's really not a problem. Don't go

1248
02:58:08,260 --> 02:58:10,180
We need to hit this perfect

1249
02:58:10,180 --> 02:58:12,979
As the as the wind ends, otherwise, we're gonna get caught again

1250
02:58:13,780 --> 02:58:30,469
So perfect win ending timing. Okay. Yeah, this is not a problem. We're fine. There's no wind here. I'm the anchor

1251
02:58:31,110 --> 02:58:37,139
I got you

1252
02:58:37,139 --> 02:58:50,520
Any wrongers win here or 432 we're already back

1253
02:58:57,040 --> 02:58:59,040
I'm gonna i'm not gonna blame you on that

1254
02:59:00,149 --> 02:59:01,270
again

1255
02:59:01,270 --> 02:59:04,389
How about you time one? Let's see. Let's see how good it goes. I don't even know what's

1256
02:59:05,909 --> 02:59:09,030
I don't even know what the button is. It was like four on the numpad. I don't know what it is

1257
02:59:09,110 --> 02:59:12,090
That's how hard it is. You don't even know the button and i'm getting critiques

1258
02:59:14,840 --> 02:59:16,840
Why would both of us do it?

1259
02:59:17,159 --> 02:59:19,879
One of us has to take the charge on it. Are you gonna swing?

1260
02:59:22,659 --> 02:59:24,659
I am so

1261
02:59:25,299 --> 02:59:31,219
Like what but it's like what does he mean? Okay, but if we get to 500 from here

1262
02:59:31,780 --> 02:59:36,500
That's we that's the end of the game. We beat it and yeah, we cheated along the way, but who cares

1263
02:59:37,379 --> 02:59:41,409
We're good. We're good. We're good. This is this is perfect

1264
02:59:43,940 --> 02:59:46,340
Dude, I I tried so hard

1265
02:59:56,799 --> 03:00:08,739
We did it again, we're gonna be we're gonna handle this three two one go

1266
03:00:09,700 --> 03:00:10,659
Uh

1267
03:00:10,659 --> 03:00:13,520
You're rushing a little

1268
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:18,319
Because I know we have the potential to succeed you're rushing just a little okay

1269
03:00:18,879 --> 03:00:22,159
No wind ice wait for wind next jump

1270
03:00:27,459 --> 03:00:29,459
I said wait. I said wait

1271
03:00:29,700 --> 03:00:35,729
I said wait, I said wait, but didn't you say no wind jump then wait? Uh, you did say wait for wind

1272
03:00:37,319 --> 03:00:38,600
because if

1273
03:00:38,600 --> 03:00:40,770
Because if the wind's going

1274
03:00:53,670 --> 03:00:59,110
We're just not meant for each other I admit it we needed to just wait a little longer

1275
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:05,040
Just don't put one of those

1276
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:11,139
Checkpoints down here. You call the shots man. Okay, you ready?

1277
03:01:11,860 --> 03:01:15,489
Yeah

1278
03:01:15,489 --> 03:01:19,090
I didn't you didn't hear anything and are we waiting after the next one?

1279
03:01:19,889 --> 03:01:23,780
Here's what we're gonna do ready

1280
03:01:23,780 --> 03:01:25,780
Get up and no no no

1281
03:01:27,620 --> 03:01:29,350
Go

1282
03:01:29,350 --> 03:01:32,469
What's you know? No, I just I don't know what the button is

1283
03:01:40,600 --> 03:01:42,680
Okay, there we go put one of those things down

1284
03:01:45,219 --> 03:01:49,540
Uh, you can't can't well, we'll just wait down here

1285
03:01:56,370 --> 03:01:58,579
There we go

1286
03:01:58,579 --> 03:02:03,040
Oh fuck we might be able to get this uh thing

1287
03:02:17,239 --> 03:02:21,559
Nice oh my baby boy with his little goatee and his rock friend

1288
03:02:22,610 --> 03:02:25,889
Jeff is going to be my partner for the journey. That's the single player

1289
03:02:26,610 --> 03:02:30,069
Oh cool

1290
03:02:30,069 --> 03:02:33,430
All right. Here we are. It didn't we're fine. Everything's good. Put one of those down

1291
03:02:34,930 --> 03:02:37,729
Mine was the real one 50 meters and we're good

1292
03:02:48,450 --> 03:03:02,420
Now i'm gonna throw you just call the taxi

1293
03:03:03,299 --> 03:03:21,959
And call a taxi

1294
03:03:21,959 --> 03:03:23,000
Okay

1295
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,489
And go

1296
03:03:27,139 --> 03:03:37,090
Help me up. Okay. There's nothing here. There's no wind here. We're good

1297
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:47,190
Good idea that one's hard to time

1298
03:03:47,670 --> 03:03:49,670
We're gonna go a lot earlier

1299
03:03:50,790 --> 03:03:55,729
Yeah, i'm saying like we go like now

1300
03:03:56,610 --> 03:04:00,639
Yep, it's it's too hard to time with the counter

1301
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:12,500
Yeah, I think it's very obvious one to go. I think we should do it. Let's go for it. Okay when it comes up

1302
03:04:15,479 --> 03:04:21,139
Okay, uh ready yes, that's perfect

1303
03:04:27,940 --> 03:04:29,219
Holy shit

1304
03:04:29,219 --> 03:04:32,149
Just go

1305
03:04:32,149 --> 03:04:34,149
One of those. Oh, no

1306
03:04:34,309 --> 03:04:39,430
Can you get me? Yeah

1307
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:45,840
Okay. So so what what what what what what what what are we what are we now? No

1308
03:04:46,639 --> 03:04:49,680
No, what are we doing after we get on that? Okay, we're going

1309
03:04:50,959 --> 03:04:54,399
And then we're going to jump to that little block immediately. Yeah, and I

1310
03:04:55,040 --> 03:04:58,159
You have I have to grab and then we'll okay. I think we have to throw from there

1311
03:05:00,389 --> 03:05:02,790
That was that was just not it was the time timing was wrong

1312
03:05:03,430 --> 03:05:05,729
Yeah, but we still had to go

1313
03:05:05,729 --> 03:05:07,889
We still had to we literally had to

1314
03:05:08,610 --> 03:05:25,329
We're good. Whoa, the wind the wind. Oh the wind bro

1315
03:05:26,129 --> 03:05:27,809
the wind

1316
03:05:27,809 --> 03:05:35,399
Okay, hold on

1317
03:05:35,399 --> 03:05:39,110
Because we need a no wind situation

1318
03:05:39,670 --> 03:05:42,799
We do need no wind

1319
03:05:42,799 --> 03:05:45,299
Okay, this one

1320
03:05:46,180 --> 03:05:48,180
Sit no, we can't oh

1321
03:05:48,659 --> 03:05:53,379
Okay, the no wind and then we immediately go up to the next one. All right. No wind immediate next one

1322
03:05:53,540 --> 03:05:55,540
Are you grabbing or am I this one? Are you grabbing?

1323
03:05:56,680 --> 03:05:59,639
I'm grabbing whoever can grab can grab. All right, then I need to

1324
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:01,719
Let you go

1325
03:06:01,719 --> 03:06:03,719
When let go on this one? No

1326
03:06:04,680 --> 03:06:08,360
That was just that was it's hard to do that. Wow that and I I didn't want you to

1327
03:06:09,680 --> 03:06:11,200
run out of breath

1328
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:13,840
Holding that's actually tricky. That one's very hard

1329
03:06:18,629 --> 03:06:20,469
Okay, we need to wait

1330
03:06:20,469 --> 03:06:24,799
Are you grabbing or am I grabbing you're grabbing go?

1331
03:06:27,700 --> 03:06:30,899
Again, again, we have to go immediately because when the wind comes back from them

1332
03:06:31,459 --> 03:06:34,819
Yeah, yeah, we have to go. We have to go honey. We have to go. I feel you

1333
03:06:38,579 --> 03:06:41,860
Not this time because when the next time and we have to immediately go to block

1334
03:06:42,819 --> 03:06:45,120
And then I'm grabbing

1335
03:06:45,440 --> 03:06:47,280
Yes

1336
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:50,479
Okay, ready one. I have to wait for the wind to end. Yep

1337
03:06:53,569 --> 03:06:55,409
Okay this time

1338
03:06:55,409 --> 03:06:56,370
nice

1339
03:06:56,370 --> 03:06:59,170
And then where am I going from here? All the way left, I guess

1340
03:06:59,889 --> 03:07:04,690
How the fuck are you gonna do that hit it? You're hitting the weirdest swings

1341
03:07:05,409 --> 03:07:08,680
We need wind you have to let me go

1342
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:11,760
I know but your swings were such shit

1343
03:07:12,950 --> 03:07:14,790
censor yourself

1344
03:07:14,790 --> 03:07:17,190
Your swings were such bad swings

1345
03:07:17,829 --> 03:07:22,690
Are you gonna say say shoot?

1346
03:07:22,930 --> 03:07:24,209
instead of that

1347
03:07:24,209 --> 03:07:25,170
word

1348
03:07:25,170 --> 03:07:28,309
What the okay anybody watching?

1349
03:07:29,670 --> 03:07:32,760
This is tough

1350
03:07:32,760 --> 03:07:35,079
Are you looking for full revolutions when I get on there?

1351
03:07:36,209 --> 03:07:39,000
Don't go

1352
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,239
Uh, I mean, yeah, that would help a lot

1353
03:07:41,719 --> 03:07:45,459
Okay, because you you were going like upright and then not swinging down

1354
03:07:45,459 --> 03:07:50,500
You're like dropping down and ganking on the roof. Keep in mind. That is the fourth time i've ever done that

1355
03:07:51,059 --> 03:07:57,989
Bro, you accepted your smurf diagnosis. What?

1356
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:10,239
wait

1357
03:08:10,239 --> 03:08:14,360
This next one immediately jump on immediately grab the block

1358
03:08:23,840 --> 03:08:27,829
Nope

1359
03:08:28,790 --> 03:08:34,069
I think it would that one isn't something that breaks. So maybe I should just land on it and drop a flag

1360
03:08:34,950 --> 03:08:39,159
Not a bad idea

1361
03:08:39,159 --> 03:08:43,250
Landing on it's hard though

1362
03:08:43,250 --> 03:08:45,250
This one we're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it

1363
03:08:47,620 --> 03:08:49,940
All right, you let me you want me to let you go on the top?

1364
03:08:50,739 --> 03:08:52,229
Let go

1365
03:08:52,229 --> 03:08:54,530
You wanna get above it?

1366
03:08:54,530 --> 03:08:55,649
Okay, nice

1367
03:08:55,649 --> 03:09:00,950
Can you just pull me up now? Yeah, there's no wind up here, right? Oh, there is there is

1368
03:09:01,510 --> 03:09:03,510
All right. Now, what the hell are we doing?

1369
03:09:04,100 --> 03:09:07,430
Are we just running and jumping or are you swinging?

1370
03:09:07,829 --> 03:09:10,469
I think i'm swinging. Can you swing from down here though?

1371
03:09:11,700 --> 03:09:13,379
That's that might be too thick

1372
03:09:13,379 --> 03:09:18,979
What do you mean? I mean if I throw you isn't that is it too thick? No, it's all right

1373
03:09:19,620 --> 03:09:27,809
Needed a little more oomph

1374
03:09:27,809 --> 03:09:29,809
Imagine this without flags. Yeah, I know

1375
03:09:30,530 --> 03:09:31,809
It'd be horrible

1376
03:09:31,809 --> 03:09:43,959
Okay, here we go. This is tricky because there's not a whole lot of room for me to run

1377
03:09:45,809 --> 03:09:47,809
We'll get it. We'll get it eventually

1378
03:09:48,290 --> 03:09:54,879
I do have to go kind of up

1379
03:09:55,489 --> 03:09:57,649
But I don't know you're you're the master

1380
03:09:58,760 --> 03:10:00,280
on the swinger

1381
03:10:01,620 --> 03:10:05,620
There it is. Oh shit. Nice drop a flag there when you get a chance

1382
03:10:06,340 --> 03:10:16,500
beautiful

1383
03:10:16,500 --> 03:10:17,780
I

1384
03:10:17,780 --> 03:10:19,780
Wasn't sure if it was gonna stop or not

1385
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:27,840
You hit the bottom of it. Yeah, I mean I hit the bottom of it

1386
03:10:28,639 --> 03:10:30,639
I'm just saying in general

1387
03:10:30,639 --> 03:10:32,639
You you did that?

1388
03:10:32,799 --> 03:10:37,969
Uh, we have to I think we have to run left and then right I think it's like a run left run right

1389
03:10:38,530 --> 03:10:41,760
See it again

1390
03:10:41,760 --> 03:10:45,440
I don't think you need to oh, oh shit. We have the camera there

1391
03:10:45,840 --> 03:10:47,840
Oh, that's fucked up

1392
03:10:47,920 --> 03:10:51,280
That's you get that far with no checkpoints. You're like, oh, let's just oh wait. No, you can

1393
03:10:52,079 --> 03:10:53,120
um

1394
03:10:53,120 --> 03:10:56,389
I don't think i'm a sentient human anymore

1395
03:10:56,629 --> 03:11:01,840
We only got like 30 meters to go. How are we doing this? What are we doing?

1396
03:11:02,719 --> 03:11:05,299
I don't know, but we're gonna do it

1397
03:11:05,299 --> 03:11:06,739
It doesn't make any sense

1398
03:11:06,739 --> 03:11:20,760
What do you do? I like throw you

1399
03:11:22,600 --> 03:11:24,120
What do you do here?

1400
03:11:24,120 --> 03:11:29,239
I think we need to time a second jump to get on top of that ice jump up on the ice. Yeah

1401
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:39,170
Hold on. Okay, we're gonna die. Yeah, and then the other one as soon as it gets to the top top

1402
03:11:39,329 --> 03:11:44,770
We gotta jump up

1403
03:11:44,770 --> 03:11:46,850
You you know, you know exactly what we're doing

1404
03:11:52,129 --> 03:11:56,290
There it is. Oh shit, we gotta and we have to keep moving. Oh, that is gonna be hell on earth

1405
03:11:56,770 --> 03:12:00,209
We have to keep flying over it. Keep doing the neck. Do the next jump. Yep

1406
03:12:00,530 --> 03:12:02,770
We just have to do just imagine you're playing this by yourself

1407
03:12:03,409 --> 03:12:21,750
That's a good attempt. All right, play the game by yourself

1408
03:12:24,819 --> 03:12:25,540
Oh

1409
03:12:25,540 --> 03:12:28,020
Okay. No, I was I had I had a misunderstanding

1410
03:12:28,500 --> 03:12:33,780
Misinterpretation we're gonna go up on ice up on ice over to the right when it gets the right elevator

1411
03:12:41,440 --> 03:12:44,280
Sorry good

1412
03:12:44,280 --> 03:12:45,399
Oh

1413
03:12:45,399 --> 03:12:48,200
Yeah, put flag down. Let's go

1414
03:12:50,959 --> 03:12:52,959
We're gonna jump you grab the

1415
03:12:53,440 --> 03:12:56,469
right

1416
03:12:56,469 --> 03:12:58,229
Oops a daisy

1417
03:12:58,229 --> 03:13:01,829
Do I think you misunderstood what we're doing? I kind of did for a second, but we're good

1418
03:13:03,250 --> 03:13:05,250
See the block what are you guys doing?

1419
03:13:07,030 --> 03:13:12,469
If we get to a new zone, i'm done by the way if it's a new zone and there's like more I can't I cannot

1420
03:13:13,110 --> 03:13:26,149
All right ready

1421
03:13:26,149 --> 03:13:28,069
Okay, let go

1422
03:13:28,069 --> 03:13:33,479
There it is

1423
03:13:33,479 --> 03:13:34,600
Flag down

1424
03:13:34,600 --> 03:13:41,000
Okay, we gotta wait after the wind ends and time this omega

1425
03:13:41,700 --> 03:13:44,190
perfectly

1426
03:13:46,579 --> 03:13:52,260
This I don't think we can count this down what's with the spam stop spamming what are you guys doing? Stop stop

1427
03:13:54,790 --> 03:14:00,370
Go wait

1428
03:14:00,370 --> 03:14:01,729
the moon

1429
03:14:01,729 --> 03:14:03,729
Ooh, all right on this top. Yep

1430
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:08,020
All right

1431
03:14:08,020 --> 03:14:10,180
There's one I think I gotta swing you

1432
03:14:12,100 --> 03:14:23,680
And this might be it

1433
03:14:23,680 --> 03:14:25,680
We did it the peak

1434
03:14:27,700 --> 03:14:30,020
The peak we did it. Did we actually do it? That's me

1435
03:14:32,760 --> 03:14:35,159
Did it we finally did it

1436
03:14:35,159 --> 03:14:37,000
Give me the rock. Oh with the we have take the rock with us

1437
03:14:42,100 --> 03:14:43,940
Kind of slow with the rock

1438
03:14:43,940 --> 03:14:48,930
We need it though. Do I need it? It's for the achievement. How do you pick it up?

1439
03:14:54,319 --> 03:14:57,680
I can't it's got it. It's got to be tied to you. Oh, well

1440
03:14:58,879 --> 03:15:08,659
We're leaving them. You just want to leave them. Yeah, we actually did it. That's the end. We did it. Nice job

1441
03:15:15,219 --> 03:15:17,139
Mail in the letter to santa

1442
03:15:17,139 --> 03:15:18,500
No

1443
03:15:18,500 --> 03:15:28,069
Oh

1444
03:15:28,069 --> 03:15:30,180
I can't believe we beat it

1445
03:15:30,180 --> 03:15:39,620
Well, we used the check marks still even with check marks. Sorry. I can't believe I stuck with it. Yeah, you stayed you stayed

1446
03:15:40,260 --> 03:15:43,059
And you know, very cool. That's fine. You had fun

1447
03:15:43,860 --> 03:15:50,819
I did I'm glad that we beat it. I'm glad that we pulled through and we got to experience this wondrous journey

1448
03:15:51,760 --> 03:15:55,350
Together that was a good time

1449
03:15:56,959 --> 03:16:01,319
Look, that's us. That's me and that's you and i'm in the front. Yep. I'm in the back

1450
03:16:01,959 --> 03:16:03,399
Checking out your butt

1451
03:16:03,399 --> 03:16:13,559
That's fun. These are the people that tortured us

1452
03:16:14,280 --> 03:16:19,569
Yeah

1453
03:16:19,569 --> 03:16:22,370

1509
03:22:45,909 --> 03:22:51,909
I'm really enjoying the roll it off brand. I have been working I have been

1510
03:22:52,469 --> 03:22:55,959
Technically going to work. I think it's great

1511
03:22:55,959 --> 03:22:57,639
I think I got a pretty good balance too

1512
03:22:57,639 --> 03:23:03,040
And like I said previously sometimes you might not see a stream for a little bit

1513
03:23:04,020 --> 03:23:25,159
But I don't think it's gonna be too crazy, but I like it if you enjoyed it's good. Yeah, I do

1514
03:23:28,530 --> 03:23:30,530
Still trying to get that healthy balance

1515
03:23:35,959 --> 03:23:38,319
any projects to look out for

1516
03:23:38,319 --> 03:23:40,399

1517
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:46,159

1518
03:23:47,219 --> 03:23:56,979
They're in development then you'll have to wait till they get announced, but they seem pretty awesome

1519
03:23:59,270 --> 03:24:00,709
You have a job

1520
03:24:00,709 --> 03:24:03,459

1521
03:24:07,590 --> 03:24:18,200
Spoil everything and get fired. What a terrible use of my time. That would be that would be so stupid
