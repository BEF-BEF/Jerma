1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:18,059
Hey, how's it going? I'm uh... I'm here. Yeah. Go back to bed.

2
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:29,460
Um, no. I will, but not right now. Welcome back everybody. Are you in a sleeping bag?

3
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:38,579
I'm streaming from a sleeping bag. It sounds like you're going through puberty. Is that what you said?

4
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,710
All right, let's... let's address the thing that we need to address.

5
00:00:54,259 --> 00:01:00,380
I have COVID. I don't think I... the last stream from, what, three or four days ago was like,

6
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,540
oh, I don't think I have COVID, but I'm testing every day and, you know, locking down and whatever,

7
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:18,760
right? Um, it's COVID. Yeah. You look at dirty teeth. No, I actually don't. But yeah, I have COVID.

8
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm okay. Um, it's become pretty clear that I'm right in the middle of it and it's not really

9
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,540
going away, but I feel okay. I just kind of feel like somebody, like, like, punched me in the face.

10
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,040
You know what I mean? Like, I've got... I'm pretty congested and it just feels like somebody went,

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,750
like, wham! Just one right hook, right to my fucking face, right? Um, but I'm all right.

12
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,189
And I... I need to start to kind of get a little more active here, uh, released in my own little

13
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:03,750
personal, uh, bubble that I'm in, because tomorrow is the VR among us sus guy stream.

14
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,550
So I'm going to... I need to get better. I have to feel a little bit better and I do.

15
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:16,939
But today I wanted to go live and hang out for a little bit. Um, streams are obviously going to be

16
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:22,860
not, um, more than a few hours for the foreseeable future until I can kind of get over this.

17
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:34,229
But today we have something interesting. It's like, you know what? Why don't I, uh, why don't I

18
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:41,370
give a buzz to my good pal Vinny, uh, Vinesauce and, uh, just ask him to see if he wants to carry,

19
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,889
uh, carry a stream for me, because that makes sick. So, uh, me and Vinny are going to play Splatoon

20
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:54,439
Salmon Runs for a couple hours or something, two, three hours. Something we've been talking about

21
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:02,810
for a while. Um, so yeah, Vinny's going to carry my stream today. I'm not, I'm, I'm not going to

22
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,740
put like pressure on Vinny to like, oh dude, you got to carry. No. Um, but yeah, let's just play,

23
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,719
uh, Salmon Runs. Something that I've been looking forward to. We mentioned it like a few weeks ago,

24
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:32,009
so let's do it. I'm going to give Vinny a call right now. Yeah, I like forget how to play. Hey,

25
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:39,050
what's happening? Hi, how you doing? I'm doing, I'm doing all right. I mean, I've got, you know,

26
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,129
I got COVID. Is that all right though? You got it. Yeah. That's okay. Cause I mean,

27
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:51,020
you know, the Splatoon will wipe all that away. Yeah. I'm just, I'm, you know, I want to just play,

28
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,319
look, you know what I've been doing the last like three days straight? I've been, okay. So I've been

29
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:08,699
playing The Sims 4 on Xbox. Does that sound fucking weird to you? A little bit. Yeah. I mean,

30
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,819
you need something to take your mind off of it. Um, you know, listen, man, as long as, as long as

31
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:18,459
The Sims are giving you an alternate life where you cannot live your own, it's fine. You know what?

32
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,779
That's true. Yeah. But, uh, yeah. So me and my girlfriend have been just kind of playing it,

33
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,300
locking down. I'm sorry that I sound like I'm going through puberty. That's well, you know what? I'm

34
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,600
sorry. I have a milk voice today. It's okay. I've never heard that expression before, but

35
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,959
the past couple of weeks, I've been losing my voice and I've sounded like the Crypt Keeper.

36
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:47,160
So don't feel too bad. I think it's, you sound relatively human compared to how I sounded. It

37
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,319
was, it was horrendous. Well, I'm glad to at least be alive. And I'll tell you right now,

38
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,600
like the next couple of days, I mean, I think me and Vinny were talking about doing some VR stuff

39
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,839
too. Um, yeah, I, I'm, I might be like a fucking weirdo, but you know what I mean? I'm like on like

40
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,560
cold medicine, right? Like, so this is like, well, this is, this is the sus guy. You know

41
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,879
what I mean? Like, let's just lean into it. Yeah. Do it for, do it because you know what? You,

42
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,279
you won't have an opportunity to do it again. We're not getting any younger. Splatoon,

43
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:24,839
not Splatoon, Among Us VR is out tomorrow. And you know, I was telling my chat, I might play it.

44
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,240
There's a chance you and I will play it at some point. Maybe it'd be fun. So be the sus guy,

45
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,920
you know, like, like when people, listen, when I see something spin, they want me to be the spin

46
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,290
guy. They want me to say spin. I say it. That's okay. Yeah. I mean, it's only one day, by the way.

47
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,290
I'm never doing this ever again. The whole entire channel is going to be rebranded to the sus shit.

48
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:53,959
It's going to be one day only. So you better be there. Imagine how many people were going to be

49
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,639
confused if they just joined in off the front page. Like I've never heard of this guy before.

50
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,800
And then that's what they get. Part of the idea is that, um, dude, it's, I'm going to put like

51
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,800
branding everywhere. I'm going to have like a sub goal. I'm going to talk about,

52
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,680
it's going to be like, I'm not, I'm not even Jeremy. It's a different person.

53
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,600
And I like that. Like, how do we borrow that? Can I be, you want to be, you want to be the second

54
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,230
side? No, you don't. No, no, no. You don't want to do that. I'm good. Don't even say it. Do you want

55
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,269
to, do you want to do, do you want to do some regular matches first and then salmon run or

56
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:34,009
you just into whatever, whatever you want to do. Okay. Um, hop into a lobby and we can just do some

57
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,529
matches just to warm up and then we'll salmon. How do, how do, um, how do I play the game?

58
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,569
Yeah, I can, I can get you, I can get you that information. Hang on. It's been a couple of weeks.

59
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:51,860
Of right trigger is shoot gun, right? Yeah. Shoot. You jump with B you squid.

60
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:56,149
I slept on this game for so long, man. Like it did really is so much fun.

61
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,500
Yeah, this is great. I mean, it's just, it's just a lot of fun to play. And you know what,

62
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,420
even though it's not ghosts, it's pretty good. I know we have a reputation. I'm going,

63
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,540
I'm going into the lobby. I only play games to kill ghosts. We only play like scary ghost

64
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:21,829
games. It's the only thing we do. Oh, okay. I remember how to play. Um, so do you have to,

65
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:27,610
do you like join off me? Do I have to invite you to the lobby? Um, I think you can join off of me

66
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,250
if you want. That's cool. Just in like the switch menu. Yeah. I got a, so just press, um, L I think

67
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,009
and then you'll here. Let me see. Wait, which L? Oh, okay. Save. Yeah. Regular L, regular L.

68
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:50,180
Right. Okay. And then join lobby. You should see mine. Okay. I see with friends. Yeah. Regular

69
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:59,189
battle is what was your name? Uh, is your name raw? No. Who the fuck is that? It's definitely

70
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:04,709
not wrong. I've never seen this person before in my life. Maybe that's my alter ego. I don't know.

71
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:19,660
It's a raw guy. Okay. Um, I'm in lobby. I see with friends. Yeah. Yeah. So it should be like,

72
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:30,220
regular L match menu. And then I see, I see friends. I don't see you. We are friends on the

73
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:39,450
switch chat. Do I have like a weird setting or something? No, not anymore. I mean, if I did,

74
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,889
you, why don't you make one and just do with friends and then I'll, I'll join off of you.

75
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:47,450
Okay. So if I just do with friends, hop into a turf battle, regular battle with friends.

76
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,460
I just click regular battle with friends. Okay. Yeah. Oh, there you are.

77
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:02,539
Well, you saw me right there online. I can create a room. Okay. Okay. So I see, I can't like invite

78
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:08,659
you, but I see you're online. So I'm creating a room chat. How do I join German's room? Do I just

79
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:15,639
press his name? There's no password on it. So that's fine. Okay. I'm creating room boomer

80
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:31,450
technology stream. I've got COVID motherfucker. All right. It's, I got it chat. Not like in a mean

81
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,690
way. I meant like, let him have this, let him be his COVID self. And like, I don't know what I'm

82
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,009
doing either. I got it. All right. No, I got it. We know what we're doing. I'm not going to even

83
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:49,100
read that. Hey, we did it. All right. Cool. That's vile. All right. I think I'm, yeah, we'll

84
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,620
probably just get random people to join in. And then like, if any of my friends can join off of

85
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,259
me, you know, just like to be in the group and carry us, feel free. Yeah. I'm down just to play

86
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:06,059
whatever. Let's do a few, we can just kind of chill and get some stuff going. Calm down. You're

87
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:11,259
aggressive. Yeah. This is, this is a low effort, like just whatever, just play some Splat. I mean,

88
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:17,299
it's not even Splatfest yet. It's not? Is that a thing? Do you know what Splatfest is, Sharma?

89
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,080
It's when you vote on one of three things and like the team that gets the most kills and like

90
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,840
win games. That's the selected thing. So this, this Splatfest, it's the Pokemon starters. It's

91
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,360
fire, grass and water. And you get to choose, you join a team and then you have to like fight for

92
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:44,330
your team. That's this weekend. That's pretty cool. It's neat. I've been out of sync this whole time,

93
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:54,179
but now I'm good. That sounds fun. That's your Splatoon name? Yeah. You said it's so dejected.

94
00:10:54,179 --> 00:11:00,710
I just like did it really quickly. Okay. What's wrong with my shirt today? What's

95
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:10,149
wrong with my shirt? He has COVID. Let him live his life. It's a Marvel shirt, not a clown shirt.

96
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:23,500
Then he go over to the robot and press A. Okay. Somebody called it an arcade carpet shirt.

97
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:32,820
Oh, there you are. It's pretty cool. So what do you usually play in this? Do you usually do

98
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:40,389
like painter or like shooter? What do you usually do? Oh, um, ready up germ. Oh, I'm calling you germ

99
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:48,309
for some reason. Is that okay? Yeah, that's good. All right. Oh, I use. Yeah, I use like

100
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,299
just shoot gun fast, but also with good range. I like that the dual pistols are fun. I like the

101
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:04,330
dodge. Yeah, I like those too. Oh, and so remind me how do you use your superpower? It's like a

102
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:15,259
button you press, right? Yeah, I think superpower is oh, I press R the stick precedent. Oh,

103
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:23,639
there it is. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's like this mech. Okay. Yeah. I have trouble with them with the mech.

104
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:31,029
Yeah, I suck with it, but it's the combo of the weapon I use. I can't choose anything else. It's

105
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:37,990
just like I'm stuck with it. Okay. All right. So you're a veteran of this game, right? I mean,

106
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:45,850
I'm fucking terrible at it, but yeah. Yeah. I have some ideas on how to like, uh, shoot.

107
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,450
Okay. It's been a while since I haven't played in a while. So let's see if I can see if I still got

108
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:55,289
it. All right. Let's get it. Let's get it. See now you understand. Yeah. That's, that's a good

109
00:12:55,289 --> 00:13:03,379
catchphrase. Oh my God. Bubbles. They're fucking shooting bubbles at us already. Sorry. I just

110
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:09,220
don't like bubbles. It's a very annoying weapon. I'm fine. They, they shoot bubbles out of a urinal

111
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,220
germina. What? Out of a urinal? Hold on. They shoot it out of a urinal. I didn't know that. I

112
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:24,009
got to see this. It looks like it at least. I don't know what it is. Oh, I'm out of ink.

113
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:32,580
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. You've okay. Good. You then you avenged me. Oh wait. It's the, um, it's the

114
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:39,220
bucket. It's like the bucket thing, right? Yeah. To me it looks like a, like a urinal or like, um,

115
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:49,480
like what are those things that they put? Like a bedpan, a bedpan with ink. Yeah. Oh God. What

116
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:57,929
even just hit me? I just, I got exploded. Yeah. We, we wiped. I have, I'm getting audio from two

117
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:04,059
different sources here. Is it like confusing? So how do you do your audio when you play the switch

118
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:13,139
and let, and talk to somebody? Uh, so I don't have anything on a delay. It's slightly delayed. Um,

119
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:20,019
essentially I am routing my capture card and I had an El Garbo too, by the way, for a while.

120
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:25,000
It focus almost just came out of my nose. I hope they didn't. No, no one saw that. Um, I, yeah,

121
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,519
I used El Garbo for a while. I had to get another one, which was even cheaper and it's fine. It does

122
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,440
the job. So basically I'm, um, audio is coming through a separate program, but the video is like

123
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,100
live, like, oh, I split. Yeah. So I don't have anything on a delay other than the audio is

124
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:49,100
delayed like half a second. So it's, there's a slight disconnect. We can kind of destroyed.

125
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:54,169
It's a warmup match. That's true though. Yeah. When was the last time you played? It's been a while

126
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:59,450
since I played. Three weeks. Yeah. We both played, we probably both played like the same day.

127
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:04,250
Yeah. Like to the day we both just got the urge to like, let's play some Splatoon.

128
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:11,610
Yeah. Separate. And then now we're garbage. That's okay. I have, uh, friends that are very good at

129
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,570
this game that are going to just hop in at some point and carry us. It's going to be great.

130
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,690
It's also all right too. We're going to be Sam and Andy's at some point, right?

131
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,940
All right. What's that? Sam and we're just going to be Sam and run Andy's or

132
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,059
Oh, oh, oh yeah. I thought you meant like Sam and Andy, like, like two names.

133
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,779
Oh, no, no, no. Like Sam and run. Like we're going to be Sam and Andy. We're going to do that. Uh-huh.

134
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:43,059
Sam and Andy. I was like, I'll be Sam. I guess. I don't know. That's fine. I don't even know

135
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:51,139
where'd you come from. All right. So how did we do on our first game back after three weeks of

136
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:58,539
being away from the game? Like 35%, 38%. That's all right. That would be, we, that we,

137
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:05,610
high MMR. It's our, our far from being so good. Yeah. I was wondering, so I have the game audio

138
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:12,070
coming through my left ear and then you coming into my right ear through here. So I, it's like,

139
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:19,429
it's weird. I have two different headphones. Are you okay? It's kind of, it's kind of bizarre

140
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:23,259
if you want me to be completely honest with you, but I can do it. It's fun.

141
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:31,940
Okay. Uh, okay. Cool. Yeah. That's what I couldn't do that. That's just too much. That's,

142
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,179
that's too disconnect would throw me off. Yeah. I think it would like my circadian rhythm,

143
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,740
like I would fall, like I'd be streaming and just fall to the ground. Cause my inner ear balance

144
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:46,179
would be thrown off. I didn't even get like a, like 2002 resolution for my score. Like,

145
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:58,379
holy shit, I'm under four ADP. That's bad. So, all right, let's do battle times. Maybe I should

146
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:07,829
change my loadout. I gotta, I gotta, we gotta get back into it. The game. Oh yeah. We got,

147
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,470
no, we get this. We got this. We got Nari now on our team. He's a mod of mine. He's,

148
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,029
he's going to carry. Oh, right. Nari. Really? All right. Let's go. His name rhymes with carry.

149
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,630
So he's going to carry us. If not, I'm going to remove him from my moderator's team. It's fine.

150
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:47,349
It's normal. It's fine. All right. I'm going to try hard this time. Actually. Come on. I got him. I

151
00:17:47,349 --> 00:18:00,490
got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. What does that thing do? I think it's a grenade. Right.

152
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:15,579
Top right is a sprayer. Okay. Can we destroy those? Yeah. Yeah, you can. Oh, I am bad at this right

153
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:26,819
now. Hey, um, do you, do you only use the duallys? No, I just, it's just what I had equipped them last

154
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:33,859
time when I was playing. Okay. Cause I've tried other weapons in this game and I, and I'm just

155
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:45,480
rotten at all of them, including the ones that I'm good at. There's so much of their ink everywhere

156
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:59,940
I can't even move. They're throwing bubbles at us from a urinal again. No ink. There ain't no ink

157
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:14,420
anywhere. I just got so bad. We, no, we got this. We got it. Ooh, bubbles. Throwing for content.

158
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:29,640
Yeah. Ready to go to the right place? What just happened? Oh, I did. Okay. Okay. Okay.

159
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,880
What the? Dude, those bubbles kill you in one hit. The bubbles are such bullshit. I really don't

160
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,650
understand them. And then they update the game and it just like, bubbles are even better than

161
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,809
usual. That's like all the, all the balance changes and bubbles have just seemed better

162
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:51,690
and better each day. How do I get that gun? Is that, how much was that? I still don't, I don't

163
00:19:51,690 --> 00:20:06,900
even have bubble. I don't know where it is. No, I don't, I don't know. Let's go. They don't know

164
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:17,240
that they can buy whatever they want. Well, now I do. God damn it. Chad, that's the exact line of

165
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,779
thinking that got me back into Pokemon cards. We, we don't need that again. Shooting the floor. I

166
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:31,099
don't even know how to control that thing, man. Shit. Dude, that, you know what that looks like?

167
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:38,630
That looks like a fucking Trix yogurt. I want it wicked bad. I've never had Trix yogurt. Really?

168
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:45,240
Wow. No, no, this just reminds me of Nickelodeon. Yeah. It's just like, like, like you win an,

169
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,839
your name is Jack Black. You win an award and they just like slime you for no good reason.

170
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,640
It's fun though. That's how we grew up. That was it. So do they want to do like how many more you

171
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:03,740
want to do before we do the salmon run? Let's do one more. We did, we did better that time. That's

172
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,910
a, come on. Look, we haven't played in a long time. Give us a little bit of slack. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

173
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:17,529
I think one, one more would be good. Guys stop streaming. I'm at work. All right. We'll, we'll

174
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:22,569
just see you later, man. It's nice to hang out. I've got to wrap it up. So, so, uh,

175
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:29,559
Jerma, your symptoms, you're, you're just like, you got a headache and stuff. Yeah. So I had a

176
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:35,559
headache like two days ago. So we're three days ago. I don't even remember. Um, I was on stream

177
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:39,160
and like the day before this is, what was the last time I streamed guys? I actually don't even remember.

178
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:48,329
Um, I had kind of like an achy slow felt kind of shitty. It was three days ago. Okay. And then

179
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:55,059
that just developed into just, I was tired and I still am. Yeah. And now I just kind of have a lot

180
00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:00,259
of, I'm not really coughing though. No cough really at all. It's more just like somebody

181
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:06,890
like punched me in the face and like my nose is stuffed. And that didn't happen, right? No.

182
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,049
Okay. Well, yeah, I see. I mean, unrelated. I got punched in the face.

183
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,609
This is your first time like with the COVID? Yeah. I didn't get it for the entire time

184
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:24,740
that it was, you know, during the major, major, major surges. Lucky enough, right? Yeah. I

185
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,650
avoided it up until about June or July rather of this year. And it was, I couldn't like,

186
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:38,170
yeah, I had the same symptoms like headache, tired fever. And then, um, it was like a week

187
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,329
of not being able to eat food because my throat hurt so much. It was like broken glass and razor

188
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:47,289
blades. Yeah. I'm so I've, I mean, obviously knock on wood, right? Because I'm currently

189
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:52,089
right in the middle of it. Um, I've been testing every, I want to say we're not, I haven't been

190
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:56,970
testing the last few days, obviously, because I have it, but I tested today. You know, you can

191
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:05,130
tell how much, you know, whatever viral, um, well, I guess whatever it is. So hold on. Let me like,

192
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:19,099
at least don't embarrass myself for five seconds while I talk. Okay. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta,

193
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:31,670
I gotta hold on. Okay. Okay. I can talk again. Okay. So, uh, use your special. I guys, I, I can't,

194
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:38,380
I don't even, I can't even see. Um, what was I saying? So yeah, you've been testing and stuff

195
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,819
just to make sure you didn't have like a high viral load. Okay. So don't laugh at that. No,

196
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:47,500
no, no. I'm just laughing. This is science. This is like medicine. No, I'm laughing at the fact

197
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:54,940
that I fucking have zero points. I think. Oh, come on. We have zero points. How can I look?

198
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,500
Are you sure this game is good for you in your weakened state? If you're going to,

199
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,339
you know what I mean? Like you may not have a voice after this. No, no, I'll be all right.

200
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:10,220
I'll be all right. I just want to make sure I have more than five points. Okay. Okay. So, um,

201
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,660
when you take a COVID test and that, that line that's at the bottom, right? It's like, oh,

202
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,940
is it faded? That's positive. Is it, you know, I'm not even playing anymore. I just got like

203
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:25,900
killed instantly. Um, like is the line, the line is like solid, solid, solid. Like I'm,

204
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:33,099
I'm in the middle of it right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry, man. I hope you feel better soon.

205
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:38,380
I appreciate it. Thank you. I feel all right though. It's not, I'm not a good enough stream,

206
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,660
right? I mean, that's, that's a positive. Yeah. It's a positive on top of the wrong kind of

207
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,140
positive. Well, honestly, I'll be completely upfront. I really just kind of want to be live

208
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,259
for a little while just because tomorrow's a big day. Tomorrow's a huge day. Yeah. I gotta be

209
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,900
confident that I can be kind of live for more than a few hours. You know what I mean?

210
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,460
Yeah, I hear you. And you want to acclimate yourself. Well, I'm, I'm happy to help. I mean,

211
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:09,259
this is, this is a thrill to just lose Splatoon with you is a dream come true. So I'm down.

212
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,660
Yeah. Let's do, let's do the salmon run. Let's do salmon run. Cause that way we

213
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,859
aren't going to get killed immediately and we're going to have fun. It's going to be great.

214
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:22,869
I mean, that was fun too, but yeah, but yeah, but it's heartbreaking.

215
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:36,500
All right. No, but no, it's a, it's to be all jokes aside. I feel okay. Now are you going to

216
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:45,480
feel okay in a headset in VR? We'll see. Hey, I mean, if there's ever a scream to be like

217
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,839
fucked up, it's tomorrow. Let me tell you. Like if I don't, if I feel like fucked up tomorrow,

218
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:55,000
like who, it's the suss guy day. Like I don't, it doesn't, I don't care. It doesn't matter,

219
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,559
right? Yeah. You just have to like leave your like meat, like your flesh behind for a little

220
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:05,319
bit and just be an entity. Like, you know what? Be a goblin for a short time and then it'll be

221
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:11,160
over and you can relax. It'll be great. So how do I, so we do, do I have to join a different menu?

222
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,789
Yeah. So I'm going to, I'll make it this time and you can join in. Um, cause I have,

223
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,069
I have some people on my friends list that are fantastic. Hacker, are you going to join Hacker?

224
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:37,190
Hacker will carry us. Yes. Okay. Splatoon. Uh, I'm said Splatoon run. Is it such a fun game?

225
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:42,230
Splatoon run sounds like the iPad game they come up with where you just are on a lane and you have

226
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:46,789
to go like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Left and right and collect coins and jump over obstacles.

227
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:53,589
Right. And it's like no regard for copyright, complete disregard for all of Nintendo's IP.

228
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,160
Okay. So, um, have you beaten the chicken in a salmon run?

229
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:10,700
I've beaten the chicken. Yeah. I call it chorizo. Yeah. No, um, sin or base can, uh, I'm ready by

230
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,059
the way, German. If you go press L go to salmon run and then you find, uh, do the same thing from

231
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:22,700
before you can join, um, base or sin, we can rotate you guys out, but I want to get Hacker in

232
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:32,200
because we, we need to win. Um, so I see private battle, regular battle, and then, uh, friend

233
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:42,019
request received. Oh, great. Uh, I think, yeah, you have to go into the salmon run lobby grisco.

234
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:46,180
Oh, I actually go to the lobby. Okay. Yeah. You have to, uh, press like,

235
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:55,059
what is it? Yeah. And then you'll see, see me and I'm recruiting. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

236
00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:05,849
So now match menu and with friends, I freelance. I think freelance. Yeah. And you should see me.

237
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:13,660
There you are joinable. Let's go. All right. Let's do it. The audio is fucked up. It is.

238
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay. There's, there's, let's get it. And, uh, we just need one more. So,

239
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,859
okay. Thank you, sin sin. We'll, we'll get you rotated in, in a bit. All right. Yeah. I love

240
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:44,359
this mode. Nari, you have to leave Nari hackers joining not Nari. I promise you Nari, we will have,

241
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:48,920
we will get you in. We're going to, we're going to rotate people out. It's going to be great.

242
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:55,019
I'm not at all confusing and annoying because Nintendo has the best online infrastructure.

243
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:04,710
Yeah. I, this, and this game is like, I mean, okay, this game has felt the most online complete out

244
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,710
of any Nintendo game I've ever played. Does that make sense? Agreed. Okay. Yeah. A hundred percent.

245
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:18,380
Yeah. I mean, smash was okay. Smash had its moments where it felt easy and then it also

246
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:24,710
sometimes felt awful, but this one feels pretty good. Yeah. It's not bad. The only problem I have

247
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:30,920
with it is a lot of disconnects. I've seen thankfully that only seems to happen to be in

248
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,400
a lobby and not in a game. I haven't seen it in a game. You know, obviously knock on wood.

249
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:41,319
I've said that like three times today now. You know, knock on wood. My family used to say that.

250
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:47,799
That was like a big one. Knock on wood. And uh, Jerma, have you ever heard of the Maloikia knife?

251
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:56,440
The Maloikia knife? Yeah. No. What's a Maloikia knife? I'll tell you about it. This is real,

252
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,200
by the way. I grew up with, um, so my, my family's Italian Americans, those that don't know me over

253
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,839
in Jerma's channel. I'm a New Yorker. So, you know, it's kind of, yeah, of course, you know,

254
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,000
right off the boat. And, um, one of the things that they would do, my grandmother and my great

255
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,519
grandparents when I was really young, but my grandmother picked up this thing was they had

256
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:22,519
a knife, the Maloikia knife. And whenever someone was sick, they would throw the knife across the

257
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:32,220
room to ward off evil spirits. Oh my God. Yep. Now I've told this story on my stream and I'm like,

258
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,859
chat, I know I'm insane. There's no way this is real. This is a false memory. It's implanted by

259
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:43,259
some movie or something, but it's real because some other families have done this too. This is

260
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:47,259
an old Italian thing where they thought that like, when you got sick, it was like spirits.

261
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,769
Wait, we're going to lose on round one? No, no, I think we, we got this. We got this.

262
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,130
So, so wait, so if somebody started to get sick, you said, like some, all of a sudden

263
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,690
somebody would throw a knife at like a wall. Yeah. My grandmother would throw a knife and

264
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,609
say Jesu Christu or something like Jesus, you know, in Italian. And then she would throw the

265
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:14,490
knife at the wall. Were people in the room? Yeah. Oh, it's gone flying past me several times.

266
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:19,690
Oh my God. Yeah. I was, this stopped happening when I was like seven, but it was definitely a

267
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:25,450
thing. I don't know if the Maloyka knife is still in my family, but if it is, I'm selling it cheap,

268
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:32,730
chat, if you want it. By the way, selling, selling things are cheap. I wish I could, I hate this

269
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,609
weapon. I don't want it anymore. How do I get rid of this? Next round. This fucking umbrella

270
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:44,390
shotgun thing sucks absolute ass. I hate this thing. Yeah. Speaking of selling things.

271
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:54,059
I've never heard of that before. Oh, you want to just get rid of the weapon. That's what you were

272
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,579
trying to say. Okay. Yeah. No, it's just a weird thing. I just thought that you might find it

273
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:06,359
interesting. That is some wacky, wacky traditions. What was it called again? A Maloyka knife.

274
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:17,509
Yeah. Right. You can throw the eggs too, right? You can throw them. Yeah. They cost as much as

275
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:23,579
it takes for a grenade. Okay. So you probably know, but for these lads, yeah, you're gonna

276
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:30,250
throw a grenade in their mouth. Yep. So I'm assuming you've played mostly salmon run, right?

277
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,970
I pretty much, I spent a little bit of time doing the other game, but this was like more fun to me

278
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:53,420
in my brain. Yeah. This is the best mode. Oh, please. What? They don't go in his mouth.

279
00:32:54,859 --> 00:33:07,670
Sometimes they bounce out. Yeah. Yeah. How many do we have? 23. 23. Yeah. We're good. We're good.

280
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:23,619
Anything else is a bonus at this point. They get it. There you go. We can't have,

281
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:28,470
it has to be more than that. So what, what if we, what rank are we on right now? What

282
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:33,750
we put difficulties is technically, I don't think this is all that high in difficulty because

283
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:40,660
I demoted, I did so bad at one point that I got like demoted a couple of times.

284
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:48,099
So this is like normal ish, I think this is a new weapon I've never seen before. It's like a burst

285
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:55,690
cannon. Yeah, those are good. That's okay. All right, German. So for this one, you got to shoot

286
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:04,009
the spigots. They're called what? Yeah, you know, the geysers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So shoot them like

287
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:08,969
regular shoot them like just like what I'm doing right now. So you shoot, shoot them until they

288
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:15,369
start, they burst and then you'll see eventually a fish will emerge from them. The golden, it's a

289
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:22,300
little confusing, but there's, there's now a golden fish that we have to shoot. That's some

290
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:33,940
crunchies over here. Right here. Right here. This basically gives me like anxiety.

291
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,730
Yeah, it's like if John Williams composed Jaws on cocaine.

292
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:48,710
All right. So these are the guys are going off. Do we need to do anything with it or no?

293
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:53,190
When it goes off, you're good. You just have to get a bunch of them open and that way we

294
00:34:53,190 --> 00:35:03,000
spawn a golden, a golden fish thing. So yeah, just, yeah. Okay. Golden fish spawning at my

295
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,820
location. Golden fish is spawning at my location on my way. That's what that means. Right. Uh huh.

296
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:27,369
Oh, wait, is it? Oh, here it is. No, it's here. Germ. All right. Get it. We got tremendously close

297
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:32,889
to not succeeding. Yeah. I'm very rusty. Oops. I pressed, I actually pressed R at the set of

298
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:38,889
whatever. Vinny, try not to open too many valves or else you'll get mobbed with other enemies.

299
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:47,579
The higher the geysers are, the closer the goldfish is. Oh my God. We nailed it. I'm so confused.

300
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:57,610
I'm getting bad advice from my chat. Does your chat ever give you like, um, bad advice? Um,

301
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:05,369
I'm trying to remember the last time I got good advice from them. Okay. I think it was probably,

302
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:11,929
um, I want to say seven or eight years ago. Oh, all right. Yeah, that's, that's pretty good.

303
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:15,690
Somebody told me to buy a certain key in TF2 and like, don't buy these ones. I went, I was like,

304
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,050
oh, what does that mean? And then I gave it up being a good, I did like advice or a certain

305
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:27,449
crate or something. That's cool. My chat was like, Vin, you should get Dogecoin. Trust me.

306
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:36,630
10 K Dogecoin. I was like, all right. No, I didn't do that. You should get Doge. I should get it now.

307
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:42,329
That would probably be smart. Like, like after the fucking crypto collapse.

308
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:59,420
It's just fucked up. All right. I got the gun. All right. I'm going to, let's see if I can get

309
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:07,179
some high scores here. Okay. Oh, the UFO is my favorite one. I'm, I'm really going to get in the

310
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:41,210
UFO. All right. There we go. Ooh, no way. We both recently had a strange phenomenon happen to us.

311
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,300
What happened? We were both, we were both on the news for different reasons.

312
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:54,219
Yeah. You were on like CNN. So fucking weird. What were you on? Like, what was your, what did they

313
00:37:54,219 --> 00:38:00,219
do? I didn't see it. Well, like, what was your thing? Um, well, there's been a few that, I mean,

314
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:07,099
well, I don't know about on the news. I did an NPR interview. Okay. That was cool. That was really

315
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:15,929
fun. It's cool. But like, you were actually like on like CNN. I was interviewed because I played

316
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:22,250
trombone champ. That's the only reason they had me on. It was, it was like a 30 second

317
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,929
total amount of me on the screen, but it got shut out to like a thousand places.

318
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:32,329
People were saying they saw me on their local news. I was like, why? That's so fucking awesome.

319
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,539
So wait, how did that happen? Did you just kind of get reached out to like, oh, hey,

320
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:42,619
we're just even playing this game. You want to know the truth? I mean, I've,

321
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:46,380
yeah, whatever the story is, I'd like to hear it. The reporter's son was a fan of mine.

322
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,860
Really? Yeah. He's like, dad, you got to see this game. This guy, Vinny plays it. That's the cutest

323
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,579
thing I've ever heard. Yeah. That's so weird though. I was like, all right, yeah, I'll be on the news.

324
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:04,139
All right. That's fine. Slow news day. Oh, I know this one. You have to throw it into the, uh,

325
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:19,699
receptacles, right? Oh goodness. That's like a, I mean, here's the thing though.

326
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:27,019
You can always kind of reach back to that no matter what. Like, oh yeah, you know, how,

327
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:31,579
you know, how did you, how was your career? What did you do? Well, I was on CNN. You know what I

328
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:36,780
mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good enough. Like I'm fine with that. Like at the top of your resume,

329
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,699
no matter what happens, no matter what happens for the next like 50 years of your life,

330
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:47,420
that could be at the top of your resume. It could be. So I will, here's the thing. I will tell you

331
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:52,860
that it was not good enough to get me verified on Twitter. What? It was, uh, yeah, there was

332
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:58,059
a denial. And now that, um, the muskrat has taken over, that whole thing is just a complete

333
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:03,079
clusterfuck. I have no idea what's happening anymore. But I said, you know what? Now that

334
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,840
I've been on the news and I'm like kind of a big deal in the trombone champ community, I should,

335
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,159
let me apply. Let me see if it happens. I got like, it's probably a good word.

336
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,360
30 minutes later I was denied. I got like a Mondo rejection. What happened to my title?

337
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:22,840
Why is this my title? This title is fucking disgusting. What the fuck is this title?

338
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:29,909
I didn't do this title. The title of the stream. I didn't make this title. I don't know what you

339
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:32,710
mean. I just saw in chat somebody said, dude, what the fuck were you thinking with this title?

340
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:39,699
And I'm like, what are they talking about? Oh, okay. I think one of my mods, it says like I'm

341
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:45,860
shitting my pants and stuff. What does it say? I shouldn't have eaten that sushi. It gave me salmon

342
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:54,679
runs. Who did this? With mods like that, who needs chat members? That's really good. All right. I

343
00:40:54,679 --> 00:41:03,449
got to hate this weapon. The salmon runs. I can't even change it. They're blaming, they're blaming

344
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:13,960
Josh. Oh, that's, that's, that's, that's it. Josh is a good lad by the way. We've, Josh and I have

345
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:22,420
played Valheim together a lot back in the day. A lot of VR stuff too. I probably wasted that, but

346
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:29,260
no, Josh is, Josh is, Josh is a good dude. Unless he's the guy that changed your title, in which case.

347
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:37,210
Yeah, in which case like what the fuck does this guy think he is? Right, exactly. I can be the

348
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:45,079
depositor if you just throw him. Okay. You can also use this receptacle here. This like device,

349
00:41:45,079 --> 00:42:10,599
it shoots them. So this is. Oh, we got to, these guys are the worst. I hate this weapon. I'm just

350
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:21,349
using it. Okay. Thank God. Thank God I did that. We're in a little bit of trouble here. I'm trying

351
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:39,179
to. We're good. We're good. Okay. Good. Good. Get a couple extra. Yeah, I can get it. Oh, okay.

352
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:44,099
Yeah, we're good. We're good. The NPR article has a funny picture of you.

353
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,699
You know, I saw somebody mention this and I've, I've heard, I've said this myself as well.

354
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,420
There are like four pictures of me that exist on the internet that anybody uses for anything.

355
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,460
There's like the one where I'm, I don't hate it and I don't know why people keep using it,

356
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,139
but I guess it's like one of like three pictures I have. You know, the one I'm talking about where

357
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:06,059
I'm like. Is it the one where they say that you look like a psycho? That's what I'm going like this.

358
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:14,099
I'm not, I can't see you. Oh, right. But you know what I mean? I'm going and people use it for

359
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:20,889
fucking everything. It's a blurry photo. I got like kind of messy hair. It's like a screen cap

360
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:29,880
from a random face, full face cam thing that I did. Um, base, can you rotate out so we can

361
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,920
get someone else in? Okay. Nevermind. Uh, next time base, next match. Um, yeah, no, it's weird

362
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,539
because also you do, you're on camera a lot. I'm not. And like, you have thousands of hours

363
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:48,739
of photos and like video of you. And if they use those same four, they're just doing it to spite you.

364
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:59,300
Yeah, that's clearly like you could take. Okay. Ready? Like, like use one of those.

365
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,980
Well, I think it's the same picture from what I like from the fucking basement.

366
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:09,690
Like you could, how many images of you can take a frame grab and just kind of blow it up and clean

367
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,130
it up and make it, you know what I mean? I'm, you know, I'm doing my own headshots later.

368
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,940
We're going, we're going, we're going, we're going to do this. I might be sick, but I don't

369
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,739
even care. I'm going to full cam and I'm just going to do various poses that you can use. And

370
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:26,139
please use, if you're going to write articles about this fucking scream, use those. We'll do

371
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:31,179
that. Maybe not. Maybe not today. I just said I was going to do it today.

372
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,699
You're like, I don't care. I'm sick. I'll do it now. It's fine.

373
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,800
I actually had, um, here's another weird one. I had some photographer ended up being a really

374
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,079
nice dude. Want to take a headshot of me in like Washington square park in Manhattan.

375
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:57,880
Yeah. And the idea was, I thought like, is this like some kind of weird thing? But it was a weird

376
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,920
thing, but not in the way I expected. He took photos of various like content creators and

377
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:09,960
YouTubers and then posted them on a website with just their subscriber number. That was it.

378
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,480
It was art. It was art, bro. It was, it's like not their name. My name wasn't on there.

379
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,920
It was just a number. Yeah. Yeah. That was the goal. It was like, the idea was it was trying to

380
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,440
kind of, I mean, if you have to explain the art, it's not good art, I guess, but I'm, uh, essentially,

381
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,400
yeah, it's like online. You're only valued by the number of subscribers you have kind of thing.

382
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,039
That's the, what it was trying, but people have just turned that into like a nightmare, like,

383
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,909
like meat rot photo of me using AI.

384
00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:51,530
Do AI is fucked up. I'm, I'm serious. I have probably had more to say, but that was,

385
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:57,289
I guess all I was going to say. That's fair. I mean, yeah, I know the, I think that picture

386
00:45:57,289 --> 00:46:03,610
of the meat, right? No, there's like, there's like this photo that looks like a headshot,

387
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:08,250
but then they put it through AI and it interpreted it in like the most bizarre way possible. And it's

388
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:13,130
like the same way you kind of have the sus guy photo. Oh, okay. This is just like a terrible,

389
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:18,329
terrible photo of me, but at least it has, you know, my subscribers. Yeah. At least that

390
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:25,059
people do know how many subs you have. Yeah. That's the important part. Somebody said my

391
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:30,119
microphone's fucked up. No, my voice is. It probably sounds like I'm talking through a wall

392
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:40,230
because I kind of am. I'm talking through a wall, which is my congestion. Yeah. Chad, do you know

393
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:47,260
what picture I'm talking about? If anyone can like grab that photo, I just want to show,

394
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:55,269
I want to put that on the screen after this match. These guys are rough. He has a big grenade heads.

395
00:46:56,409 --> 00:47:03,989
Yeah, I don't, I don't like them at all at higher levels. This, this is absurd. I can imagine.

396
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:11,750
Diamond run is just absurd. And if you like even just casual conversation like we're having

397
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:17,989
is enough to ruin the match. You know, it does feel that way. You know what I don't understand?

398
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:22,150
And like, like honestly, if you were, if you can do this, I know a lot of like streamers can do

399
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:25,989
this and a lot of people like probably watching and the chats can do this too, but I don't know

400
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:31,190
how people play video games at a very high level. Well, just talking about like whatever,

401
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:36,469
like people like, you know, playing Valorant and they're like, and then they're talking about like

402
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:39,030
their favorite Dunkin Donuts order and shit. It's like, I don't even know how people do that.

403
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:47,269
Right. Yeah, I can play like low, low effort baby games, but not. Yeah. I can't hear it. Oh,

404
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:55,159
fuck. Yeah. Chad, here's the photo. Jerma, I'm going to put this in our call and you can

405
00:47:55,159 --> 00:48:03,510
when on your own time. Oh my God. It's fucking horrendous. You look like an alien that ate

406
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:14,809
Vinny and like became him. Yeah. Which explains a lot. I mean, that it's scary. Yeah.

407
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:22,550
All right. Let me get back up there. Yeah. AI isn't a really especially AI images.

408
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:25,590
They're in such a weird place where do you feel like when you look at an AI image,

409
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,829
you are looking at the way that stuff actually feels and looks like in a dream?

410
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:37,349
Yeah, I've I've had the same thought. Yeah, absolutely. Like you can't grasp it. It's just

411
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:42,420
the more you look at it, the worse it gets. Who's shooting us with that laser?

412
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:47,780
Yeah. If I had a dream that you and I went to go get like a piece of pizza somewhere,

413
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:55,849
this is what you would look like in my dream. Right. Right. And yet you have to see

414
00:48:56,889 --> 00:49:03,130
some of the new AI stuff. Like I saw some photos where I was like, that's a real person. Yeah.

415
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:08,730
I couldn't tell the difference until I looked at their hands. It's always the hands, right?

416
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:13,369
You know, like when someone's like deceptively old and they had a lot of work done. But if

417
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:20,010
you look at their hands, you know, interesting, interesting. I'm telling you, like Martha Stewart,

418
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:29,210
she she's like 80. She looks like she's 50 at most, but her hands are 90. Wow. AI is the same way

419
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:35,690
because it adds like five fingers and like makes them all weird. Yeah. Hands are the giveaway.

420
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,929
That's that's the trick. You'll always know, right? That kind of like if you're in a dream,

421
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:45,369
you look at a clock. Right. Yeah. If you look at it, you guys don't know if you're in a dream

422
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:50,489
and you like don't know if you're dreaming or not. If you look at a clock, it'll just be a bunch of

423
00:49:50,489 --> 00:50:00,280
it'll be a mess. It won't be like alien language. I have like, do you have recurring dreams, Jerma?

424
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:07,619
I do. What are do you have any specific locations that you go back to? A lot of my recurring dreams

425
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:13,940
are in my bedroom. Like I'll wake up and it's one of those things where I'll wake up five to ten

426
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:19,380
times in a row in a different dream in my bed. And I just can't escape the dream world. It's

427
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:26,570
happened like three or four times now. Shit. It'll be like, okay, I'm awake now. And it's like,

428
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:31,829
no, I'm like a weird AI version of my bedroom. And no, this is something's weird. Something's off.

429
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:37,190
And then something really strange will happen. And I wake up again. And the same feeling happens.

430
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:42,469
It's like, okay, I'm obviously not this is not real. Because you know, this is not real,

431
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:48,539
because my bed frame is not 10 feet around the bed. Right. This is not accurate, right?

432
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,300
Stuff like that will just keep happening. And I'll keep waking up and being like terrified.

433
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:00,619
Jesus. Yeah, even that. Yeah, I don't have that experience personally. That's, that's, that's.

434
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:05,340
Yeah, you'll kind of wake up. If those of you that have these recurring kind of bedroom dreams,

435
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:13,880
you'll wake up and you have a ceiling fan. No, I don't. Well, that's weird. That's not my room,

436
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:22,329
but it is. I don't have a ceiling fan. Bizarre. Someone said, Vinny, have you ever seen your phone

437
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:28,889
in your dreams? You know what? That's fucking weird, because I'm on my phone like all the time,

438
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:34,409
as most of us are, have never once looked at my phone in a dream. Let me tell you something not

439
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:37,130
to do, but you're going to do it next time. And it's you're going to it's going to change

440
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:42,170
literally your entire life forever. If you're ever in a dream and you know, I feel like I don't want

441
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:48,070
to say this because it sucks. Okay. If you're in a dream and you're in like kind of lucid dreaming,

442
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:51,590
and people, people in my chat know this, but I might be scaring people in yours.

443
00:51:52,230 --> 00:52:00,550
Okay. Well, look in a mirror. Go find a mirror and look in it. It is. But are you, you're inventing

444
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:06,630
the mirror. Yeah, because your brain does not understand mirrors when you are asleep. So when

445
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:13,349
you look at a mirror, it's your subconscious trying to recreate a full mirror in your head.

446
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:19,960
And it has so much trouble doing it that you will look at yourself in a mirror and it'll be this

447
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:26,599
weird, like eyeless, like demon person that's looking back at you and like their proportions

448
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:32,019
are all wrong and weird and shit. It really is like AI trying to make a person. It's like that

449
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:38,860
episode of Star Trek when the holodeck can't compute the data fast enough. It's true. Yeah,

450
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:45,980
that's such a good way to put it. Um, if you, uh, hold a, oh, sorry. I have like three headphones.

451
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:54,099
That's okay. Three headphones. How many years do you have? Well, I've, you know,

452
00:52:54,099 --> 00:53:00,460
look at my AI generated face. I got like four years. Oh, okay. I don't think I've ever even

453
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,980
looked at a mirror in a fucking dream. I think the most, I know I've seen myself in dreams,

454
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:11,900
but like from a third person perspective, but I, for me, it's more, more location-based. Like I

455
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:18,820
keep going to weird post-apocalyptic versions of places. I already know they're not like fallout.

456
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,460
They're just wrong. They're just wrong. And I keep going back to them. Like once every month,

457
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:30,099
I go back to this weird mall that has a PF Chang's type Chinese food place and like a flea market.

458
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:36,820
Really? And I don't buy, I never buy anything. And it's just anxiety dream. So it's so weird.

459
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:44,940
Yeah. So my dreams are more location-based, but I've had plenty of, um, I was, uh, do you ever

460
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:50,619
keep a dream journal? I, you know, I used to, I used to, I got really into it for a little while,

461
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:54,940
but then I ran into the problem that you probably run into too, or maybe you have,

462
00:53:56,059 --> 00:54:02,059
you will wake up after a dream and you're so tired and you're like, I need to write this down,

463
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:06,699
but I don't give a shit at all. I'm going back to bed. I'm tired. Yeah.

464
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:12,409
That's, that's the thing that happens to me with music. So I wake up with, with songs,

465
00:54:12,409 --> 00:54:17,849
like some of my songs come from dreams and I have to like hum them into my phone and I've lost a

466
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:23,449
number of ideas. Cause I was just too tired. I was like, fuck it. But I did have, um, a dream

467
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:29,050
journal and I was telling my chat when I was taking melatonin a lot, I was having the most

468
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:32,730
bizarre fucking dreams. I had one, one dream that I was hanging out with Martin Scorsese,

469
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:41,300
but he was a stick insect and he was like, you know, I know you like my movies, but you know,

470
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:47,539
I'm a stick bug. So there's no more like, all right. Thanks. Mr. Scorsese. That sounds like,

471
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:54,659
like a Rick and Morty routine. Yes. Yeah. That's like a Rick and Morty like episode.

472
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,739
Oh, thank you. Scorsese stick bug for the advice. Right. Like that's,

473
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:05,380
that's a Rick and Morty routine. Yeah. Uh, thanks. Thanks. Mr. Scorsese stick bug.

474
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:10,099
That was really cool. Yeah. Mr. Scorsese stick bug. You're the man. Whoa. Scorsese. I love your

475
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:18,039
movies. Love your movies. Yeah. I think I just went, I had a lot of, a lot of good ones.

476
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:24,360
Have you watched the new Rick and Morty season? Yeah. I had, how'd you feel about it?

477
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:35,369
It's all right. I, it's all right. Very incest-y. Yeah. A lot of that. A lot of that.

478
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:44,340
My chat's like, what? I mean, just watch it. There's like two episodes with that topic.

479
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:51,750
I mean, it's pretty good. It's not like season two good, but it's, it's okay. Some of it was good.

480
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:55,429
I think honestly, the first couple of seasons of Rick and Morty I thought were actually very good.

481
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:02,170
Yeah. I agree. Memes aside, I made myself look like such a tool because I was so into it.

482
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:09,610
But yeah, but like people, okay. Like Family Guy, right? Like Family Guy was just like funny for

483
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:23,750
the first like four or five seasons, right? Six seasons. Yeah. Got into it. I mean, I didn't get

484
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,750
into it. I just, you know, watched it. It was a thing that was, well, you have to remember too,

485
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,389
this is something really important that I think a lot of people don't really understand about

486
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:37,349
like Rick and Morty, right? Adult, it's not, it's adult swim. Adult swim for a very, very long time

487
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:41,829
was like, just didn't have that new thing that they didn't have very many shows.

488
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:48,150
There was no shows that were coming out from adult swim that were like big hits, big deals.

489
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:54,389
No. Yeah. That was the first one in a long fucking time. Yeah. They were doing a lot of reruns.

490
00:56:54,389 --> 00:57:01,820
Like there was like, yeah, Family Guy, a lot of Aqua Teen, stuff like that. Yeah. Well, I also,

491
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:05,579
that, you know, I, I will stand, well, I didn't really talk about it, but have you seen Smiling

492
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:11,820
Friends? Yeah. Love Smiling Friends. That's fucking phenomenal, right? Yeah. Awesome. And like the

493
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:17,340
anti Rick and Morty in a way too, cause it's so simple and it's so like gag based, but weirdly

494
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:25,130
smart. Yeah. I think it's great. I love that show. Every single episode of that show has been like,

495
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:32,630
wow, this is just clever and funny. Yeah. I I've I'm dying to voice a slug that gets stepped on

496
00:57:33,269 --> 00:57:38,070
like as a site gag. Or I'm just like, oh, and then I get stepped on and that's, that's the gag.

497
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:49,769
I'll be really happy with that. You need to be a stink bug, Bill. That's fine. Oh,

498
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:58,679
this is one of those long levels. That's all good. The, uh, the turrets make this one good.

499
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:07,030
I'm just going to start tossing them. All right. Oh, with this water here, I've been bad at these.

500
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:15,190
Jermbo, I have one more question for you, actually. I have a meaning to ask you. Ask away.

501
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:21,400
Ask away. All right. Um, how are you? Did you finish breath of the wild or did you?

502
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:27,880
No, I am still going. Did you enjoy your play time so far? It's phenomenal. It's phenomenal.

503
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:33,800
It's phenomenal. Uh, no, yeah, it's great. Cool. Yeah. I'm happy to hear that. I'm glad you like it.

504
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:38,679
Uh, I honestly, it's just, um, all the traveling I've been doing and then getting sick is just

505
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:44,730
kind of, I really wanted to get back and just start screaming again. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like

506
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:51,610
you've had a busy couple, a couple, uh, months. It's been, it's been busy. Yeah. We've got a bunch

507
00:58:51,610 --> 00:59:00,280
of projects coming to working on trying to stay busy. I, I need to throw a grenade at that guy.

508
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,489
I think we might be in trouble here. Um, yeah. Use your ultimate. I think you got it.

509
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:12,199
Did it work? I don't know. Just get them in, get them in there.

510
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:19,260
Mary, get them in. You got it. You got it. I should have been focused more on the game.

511
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:29,539
That's my fault. Ask him about the Battleaxe dodging stream. Please swim. I guess I haven't

512
00:59:29,539 --> 00:59:39,030
played this game in like six months. Uh, oh, the Battleaxe. Yeah. Um, I mean, people are talking

513
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:45,110
shit about how we're not very good at this game, but it doesn't really matter because, um, I can

514
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:50,860
dodge a Battleaxe in real life and I'm going to. I don't understand this. What's happening?

515
00:59:50,860 --> 01:00:00,539
That's exactly the response I'm looking for. Let's leave it at that. Uh, you, you don't,

516
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:08,380
do me a favor. Don't die. We like having you around and, uh, yeah, just have fun.

517
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:14,659
It's actually really funny. The, whenever I tell somebody about this, it's like a person,

518
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:18,340
like a personal friend or a streamer or something. I get that same response of like,

519
01:00:21,019 --> 01:00:24,860
everything good? Like this is good, right? Like it's not, you know, you doing this for real?

520
01:00:25,699 --> 01:00:33,099
I'm like, no, it's going to be fun. Just like if I'm here, if you need me though,

521
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:38,760
everyone's like, dude, you're not going to like really dodge a Dax, man. Like,

522
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:44,920
right. This is like a funny joke. I'm just like, why don't you fucking tune in? I mean,

523
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,599
I'm going to tune in now that you've said it, but I'm, I'm worried. Like I'm, I'm,

524
01:00:49,159 --> 01:01:01,820
you know, I'm worried now. I'm going to be fine. Don't worry. I'm going to be fine. Also, uh,

525
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:10,570
Jerma, you have to join the new lobby. Oh shit. All good. We, we're very close to fighting Chorizo.

526
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:16,010
I think we are, right? Yeah. We're not too far off. Uh, Newt, can you also, uh, fuck off?

527
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:22,869
Are we great? That was so mean. No, no, they're, they're my friend. Newt is great. Newt's a good

528
01:01:22,869 --> 01:01:30,780
friend. No, it's going to be, it's going to be like, you know, it's going to be a fun event

529
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:34,860
stream. It's going to be fun. It's not going to be, there's going to be fun activities and

530
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:43,059
don't worry, it's going to be fun. Okay. If I have to do a eulogy for you at any point on my stream,

531
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:54,059
I'm just going to be upset. So be like, you know what? I met him at PAX one year.

532
01:01:55,349 --> 01:02:02,199
We, we, it was cold. We walked around. It was cold. It was very cold. He was a nice lad and

533
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:07,400
that was a good time. We liked, we liked to bust ghosts and that'll be like, I'll be like,

534
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,960
we'll miss him. But he just, he had the desire to get chopped in half by a battle axe.

535
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,039
No, I just got to prove to everybody that like I've got the physical capabilities that people

536
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:24,440
just don't understand. I mean, I'll do like, I'll do like a jump, I'll do like a jump or like a,

537
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:30,920
like a cartwheel or something on camera. Uh, and like I jumped up on, uh, on a chair on name,

538
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,780
your price. And everyone was like, Holy shit. And I'm just like, okay. Yeah. So do I have to,

539
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:47,559
how many more of these do I have to do? I mean, some people just post videos of them like doing

540
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:55,130
athleticism, you know, like, like on a couch or something, like, you know, like not actually

541
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:59,130
dodging a battle axe. You know, what's funny that you mentioned this right now, there are tons of

542
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:05,050
people who are incredibly athletic, putting up like parkour videos of like an amazing athleticism.

543
01:03:05,769 --> 01:03:11,130
Uh huh. I jumped up on a chair on, on a show and I'm like, I can dodge an axe.

544
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:23,820
What? That, that's like my barometer here. That's good. That's a nice, that's a nice logic. Um,

545
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:30,539
just, yeah, I'll tune in for that. I don't have a hard date for it yet. Still trying to plan a

546
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:37,260
few things around it as well as maybe another show too. So sure. Yeah. I can imagine planning

547
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:47,989
a few things around it. The will, you know, the suit. The suit. Yeah. What's this thing?

548
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:52,710
You want it like, you know, you want it to be buried in a double breasted suit. Like that's

549
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:57,429
important if you're chopped up. Whoa. Yeah. I think I got, I think we just got killed by the

550
01:03:57,429 --> 01:04:06,039
same thing. No, no, no. We're not dead yet. We're not dead yet. Oh, who's still alive? Is it you?

551
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:10,280
I'm alive. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm going to get you guys back. We should be like together, right?

552
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:17,909
Here. I'm going to, I'm going to get you guys back. Nice. Oh my God. What an absolute save that was.

553
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:30,139
All right. Now we just got to get a couple more. Oh my God. Just need a couple more.

554
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:38,519
All right. I'm down. We. Oh, all right. It was a good, it was a good try. All right. So this next

555
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:44,309
one here. So here's what we're going to do for this next one. You and I concentrate are only allowed

556
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:53,670
to talk about the video game and we have to call out video game information. Cool. Okay. Yeah. We

557
01:04:53,670 --> 01:05:08,280
died on wave one. People are laughing at us. Yeah. Yeah. Oh boy. I lost rank from that one. My, um,

558
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:14,460
my friends are, I'm sorry, hacker. You lost rank. I'm so sorry. Oh wait, that's bad. That's actually

559
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:26,170
not good for your friend. I think hacker left. Oh no. Friendship only goes so far when de-ranking.

560
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:32,090
Oh no, she's back. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I was actually like hilarious. I

561
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:38,199
felt really bad about that. Yeah, me too. Let me make sure this is nice and pushed in.

562
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:48,780
Okay. Here we go. All right. Okay. We're now landing on the battlefield. All right.

563
01:05:49,579 --> 01:06:04,070
I have entered my squid form. Yep. Just trying to get a paint everywhere so we can

564
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:12,840
clear on the side. Yep. I am attacking a thing with a metal umbrella and depositing eggs.

565
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:42,170
UFO by me. UFO down. Good. Snake over there. Snake dead. Throwing eggs. Tower. Grenade out.

566
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:51,429
Chet, this is not an E3 commentary track. Sorry. Retrieving egg. Throwing egg. This is not an E3

567
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:59,480
commentary track. E3 commentary track, we would add like way more words here. And then call each

568
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,880
other broski. Yeah. Like you're, yeah, you're forgetting to add like the extra like three or

569
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:13,960
four words per sentence. Right. So if you, if you were wanting to say, uh, like, uh, eggs here,

570
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:19,670
instead of being like, Hey, eggs by me, you'd say, Hey, eggs over here. Seven o'clock,

571
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:26,150
seven o'clock eggs, retrieving eggs, throwing them. All right. That's frosty. Oh yeah. Be like

572
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:35,780
eggs over here. Gnarly bro. You forget to add like the last like couple of words. I'll try to

573
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:39,780
remember. I mean, I would, I would call that unbelievable. That's a 100% higher than what

574
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:49,460
we needed. You know what? If we just act like E3 people, definitely real people. And we call

575
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:56,230
out gameplay. We double what we need. That's how good we are. I know everyone makes that joke,

576
01:07:56,230 --> 01:08:02,789
right? About like the E3. But why wouldn't they just record people just playing the game? Like

577
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:06,150
just why don't just record like some of the devs just like playing it and like having fun.

578
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:10,789
Yeah. I mean, the devs definitely not like random people, but yeah,

579
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:22,439
yeah. Like get the devs who are best at speaking like the top four. Anyway, we're sorry. Throwing

580
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:26,199
egg. They really don't even need to be like, just, just hang out and just play it right. Like,

581
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,640
I don't think people really need to hear like, oh man, that's what me and my squad's going to

582
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,479
sound like. Just play the game. You know what I mean? And this is what happens when I fucking talk.

583
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:41,079
Yep. All right. I'll be retrieving you momentarily. Thank you, hacker. I appreciate that.

584
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:48,760
We're going to get you back up. All right. Big lad this way. We're going to take them down.

585
01:08:49,640 --> 01:09:00,439
Tango's down. Snake about to be down. Snake down. Oh, thank you. You saved me. Thank you.

586
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:17,140
Watch out. Big UFO. I honestly don't even know what this does. What is fucking happening? Unleash?

587
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:36,340
Did I do it? Any more eggs? There's a couple, but I think, yeah, we're good. We almost doubled again.

588
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:43,340
That's pretty good. Someone said never played Splatoon. What is happening? We are eliminating

589
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:54,739
tangos and retrieving eggs and putting them into receptacles. So what this, uh, the splat umbrella

590
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:59,850
is that does the umbrella do damage or is just a shield when it launches out? Um, it does damage.

591
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:12,899
You should use it like a shotgun, but if you need a shield, you can hold it. Oh my God. Shit. But I

592
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:50,380
had it. Snake to our right. Oh boy. What? Splatted by big shot. All right. We're okay. Yep. It's the

593
01:10:50,380 --> 01:11:18,380
dolphin thing. Okay. Damn. That took a while. Power over here by me. Okay. We're almost at

594
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:26,460
quota. Yeah, we got this one guy with a laser beam. Get out of here. Yeah. I hate those things.

595
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:43,739
Come on. Come on. Here we go. All right. All right. It's chorizo timing. So what's the

596
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:50,710
strategy here? The trick here is usually you want to kill bosses as fast as possible and then throw

597
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:55,270
the eggs at him. But it also helps to have someone shoot him a little bit or like, so

598
01:11:55,829 --> 01:12:01,670
you want to kind of, I think the best strategy is to divide between bosses and eggs and actually

599
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:05,590
shooting. Okay. Uh, chorizo himself, but it doesn't, it's not overly effective.

600
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:15,140
So we should just ignore him and just kill bosses and shit. That's the big strategy. Yeah. That's

601
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:29,500
the main one. I think I have no audio. Wait, can you hear me? I can hear you with nothing else.

602
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:59,159
Okay. Cool. I still can't hear anything. Why halfway halfway. There's some eggs down here too.

603
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:06,229
Okay. We got those eggs. Oh God. Oh God. That's getting crazy. Um, be sure to use your special.

604
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:21,430
If you have one term, the wrong. All right. Unleash the water. Nari, help me. Okay.

605
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:40,500
Damn. I don't know what that special does. So you charge up booyahs and then you bomb.

606
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:46,260
That's it's just a nuke basically. Yeah. I was just like tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap,

607
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:58,090
tap, there you. Hit R right? Um, yeah, pretty much. I beat him once, frankly, like one time. Um,

608
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:04,659
how are you feeling by the way? I feel good. I'm fine. Do you want to play a little more

609
01:14:04,659 --> 01:14:08,020
or I don't know if I'll have time to go for another chorizo. I want to make dinner

610
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,899
because I, all this chorizo talk is making me hungry. Oh I thought you, for a second.

611
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:14,579
I thought you said you were making chorizo. So you like. I don't want it now, but.

612
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,850
Well, I can take I can go on my own, too

613
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:20,159
Okay, so how about this?

614
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:26,520
We'll do we'll do a couple more and then when I feel my stomach starts it, you know eat at my stomach lining

615
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:29,250
I'll let you know. Yeah

616
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:35,399
Hey look this this the whole point of me being on screen today is to see if I can make sure I can be the sus guy

617
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:39,789
Tomorrow, that's a lot to live up to man. I know

618
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:47,109
Like joking aside though, how does it feel that that sus guy thing has like spread far beyond

619
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,250
Like you as a human

620
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:56,170
Well, let's see how much money I make tomorrow. I hate my laugh. That's cool, man

621
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:08,279
That's great. That's great. All right. Okay. Hey, you know DMV in like a few days and we'll talk we'll talk

622
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:16,329
If you Nari, I guess do one more with us and then we'll get Sin City in here just to rotate out

623
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,909
Thanks, Nari

624
01:15:19,909 --> 01:15:25,859
Appreciate it. Yeah, the the one thing I have that has kind of I mean a couple things

625
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:30,979
Have had a little weird reach but the main one is me saying the word spin in a funny voice

626
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:38,399
That one was weird places that it just like like if there's a tick-tock of something spinning. They usually overdub my

627
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:42,069
my voice

628
01:15:42,069 --> 01:15:49,779
Really? I feel like yeah, I probably heard it. It's just I'm sorry to do this everybody, but especially Jerma's audience

629
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:54,260
I apologize, but spin that I think I've actually heard that before

630
01:15:54,779 --> 01:15:57,399
Yeah, it's stupid

631
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:05,720
Whole day. Sure. I'm so sorry. I've had like a bunch of cold medicine today. I'm sorry. Okay

632
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:26,439
Someone just said you're that guy. I don't I don't know. Am I who am I really? I don't even know

633
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:31,159
You actually know what I could do after this. I could probably just go right to breath of the wild play for a little bit

634
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,359
Whenever you're uh, I think you've had enough of this platoon

635
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:37,560
That's cool. How long do you usually stream for anyway? Um

636
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:40,439
Typically

637
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:41,720
somewhere around

638
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:45,289
Five to seven hours depending like four and a half to seven

639
01:16:45,989 --> 01:16:49,659
Okay. Yeah, you got me. I do four

640
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:55,460
Yeah, I mean it was like sweet spot. I think I used to do like four

641
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,060
But I started streaming a lot less

642
01:17:00,539 --> 01:17:06,439
So you know, yeah, how did I even die? I don't know what happened

643
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:19,439
Gotcha. Thank you. I think for me like a sweet spot at this point is like six hours and that's like what twice a week

644
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:22,560
Once a week, I mean it like two or three

645
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,720
Two or three. Yeah

646
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:31,539
Sometimes more sometimes less

647
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:38,859
I'm doing three a week for like four hours each time usually but I also do on my

648
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:41,100
One like in the mornings when I wake up

649
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,699
I usually do like I record like an hour or two of a game. I just I'm interested in and

650
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:53,340
That oh god and that's uploaded like pre-recorded on my youtube channel. So it's not live, but I basically do the same shit

651
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,399
I'm doing now. Yeah, and it's it's been really good for me because I get I

652
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,979
Feel like I feel better as a person when I upload something every day

653
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,220
It's bizarre. I don't know why I feel that way, but it's nice to have like a new upload every day

654
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:13,880
I you know YouTube is one of those things that I probably gonna start to get a little more involved in as

655
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,039
Time goes on here

656
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:21,329
But you started on YouTube no

657
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:25,270
Yeah, but I mean but as of like the last few years

658
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:29,989
I've been pretty much only twitch with like the second channel having highlights and stuff, right?

659
01:18:31,069 --> 01:18:34,920
But I don't know. I have no idea

660
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:45,529
Dude, you wanna know what I was so pissed off about

661
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:48,289
What's that? So?

662
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:54,729
The the Xbox I play like I usually just kind of chill and play Xbox on the couch and I'm just kind of hanging out

663
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:57,729
They have like a record feature

664
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:00,170
Right. It's like oh you can record a clip

665
01:19:00,409 --> 01:19:05,130
it's I'm really like funny shit has happened in a lot of these just random things that I'm doing just lying on a couch and

666
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:07,890
I didn't know this until pretty recently

667
01:19:08,609 --> 01:19:15,109
But Xbox fucking auto deletes all the shit that you ever record unless you put it on to like a hard drive

668
01:19:15,609 --> 01:19:17,609
I was like, excuse me

669
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:19,770
All my funny shit is gone

670
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:23,449
No, I didn't know that

671
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:28,569
Yeah, you have to like up so you were planning on taking all of it and uploading it like eventually

672
01:19:28,569 --> 01:19:33,470
I was gonna do like a video. I was gonna make a video like on the shit that I was playing

673
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:47,000
Like what games are you playing on Xbox though? Um, so believe it or not. I was playing a lot of Shadow of War. Oh

674
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,039
Lord of the Rings middle earth. Yeah

675
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:59,819
Which that game is so fun. So funny. Yeah, I've never played it and I'm a huge fucking Lord of the Rings fail

676
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:05,000
God, I'm a big Lord of the Rings nerd. Really? You've never played shadow never played it. No

677
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,359
any

678
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:12,060
Yeah, I know what you're doing like tomorrow, right?

679
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:18,579
It's that game is 100% content

680
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,500
Okay

681
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:28,449
Like that game is just content. Okay, and it's just is it good for a Tolkien fan too, or is it like yo, yeah

682
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:32,260
It's I mean, we're not really

683
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:35,100
We got we got beat pretty bad. It's all right. We just like tang would chat

684
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:39,100
That's probably one of the funniest games ever

685
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:41,619
I don't want to spoil anything for you

686
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:47,899
But like the amount of wacky just absolutely wacky shit that could happen in those games is just is a record breaker

687
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:52,159
All right

688
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,239
Am I getting bad chested for saying content?

689
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:01,899
Hacker I'm so sorry that we are decreasing your rank

690
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:08,380
You don't have to continue playing with us hacker. Yeah, we don't have to win enough to drag you down

691
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:13,939
Like I'm gonna do maybe like two or three more, you know, cuz I'm enjoying

692
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:21,899
Hanging out with Jerma as well hang on to but I also do not want to ruin hackers rank because hackers like

693
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:26,670
Pro yeah, you can only hard carry so much, right?

694
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:34,939
Well, okay. I know I go content. I say that's not I what I mean by that is if you've ever thought of us

695
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:42,390
If you've ever thought about screaming that game or like making a video on that game. It's just it's it's so good

696
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:45,090
It's so fun. There's so many things to do. I

697
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,720
Felt that way about birth of the wild

698
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,960
Just because it's like just all these wacky physics situations that can you can get yourself into

699
01:21:55,399 --> 01:22:00,659
But I know that like the nemesis system has the you know, that's where the fun is, right? Oh, yeah

700
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:08,550
Okay. Okay. This there is just something that hits so hard when you play that game and I

701
01:22:08,989 --> 01:22:10,989
Don't want to say anything cuz like, you know quite it

702
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:14,390
Okay. Yeah, that's a good suggestion. I'll keep it in mind

703
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,229
But I'm just gonna mute and say it to my stream

704
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:22,340
Okay, but when you play that game and you just kind of

705
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:27,779
Walking around like looking for like the starter. Well, shirma is is muted or has muted me

706
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:31,779
He probably can still hear me in one of his three headphones, but I'm true. I could

707
01:22:32,939 --> 01:22:38,220
so when you're just like walking around looking for the start of a mission and all of a sudden the game just takes control and

708
01:22:38,619 --> 01:22:42,020
Pans over and zooms in on a guy that's just like a ranger

709
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:48,920
Oh, you thought you could kill me but I'm back and I'm ready to eat your blood or like it's it's so fucking funny and

710
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:55,079
Then like a caragor bites him and kills him in one hit. It's just like it's absolute fucking zany nonsense

711
01:22:58,689 --> 01:23:08,399
I'm back. Okay, so I'll take your recommendation and when I have a little like time where I have like, you know

712
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,399
Some some gaps in my schedule. I'm gonna check out that game

713
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:16,210
Yeah, I don't know if it's completely

714
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:21,430
Canon Lord of the Rings. I mean the story is good enough. I think I

715
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:26,829
Don't think it's fully canon. But after rings of power, I'll probably be like this is amazing

716
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:34,529
Why did this get ran over? Oh, yeah, the glow flies. I this is the worst one

717
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:41,529
Hacker you left at the exact right moment. I know this is like the word guarantee. This is just a nightmare

718
01:23:42,350 --> 01:24:10,220
Pause it pause it. What's the time? Did it work? I pressed it

719
01:24:12,529 --> 01:24:16,010
You know, there's something about audio coming through one headphone like

720
01:24:17,529 --> 01:24:33,329
I feel like I'm playing with like like my eyes closed. We did it kind of we just need to live now

721
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:35,789
Somebody stay alive

722
01:24:35,789 --> 01:24:45,850
Wow, who did it? I don't know. I said well sin got us back up sin city. So thank you since it nice job

723
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:51,270
All right, Jeremiah, I have a chat member named colostomy bagel. Okay, I wanted you to know that

724
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:59,220
That's all oh

725
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:02,340
Here's another question. Do you like the Sims? Do you like city builders?

726
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,239
Um, I played

727
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:13,119
What the city's skylines, right? Yeah, that was fun, but I'm too stupid for it. I really can't do it. Okay

728
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,819
All right fair enough

729
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:19,800
Honestly, like I I want to play the sims 4 again on screen

730
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:25,399
That's another game that just has so much weird shit that happens all the time. I'll probably never have played a sims game

731
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:28,800
am I just like

732
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,489
like

733
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:34,250
me capping my my channel by not playing sims and like

734
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:37,970
I mean, but just out of mortar. Yeah, you could start in the very beginning

735
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:44,189
There's like a hundred years of video games that you could play just by playing the sims franchise in a row

736
01:25:44,649 --> 01:25:49,189
You would love the sims too

737
01:25:49,329 --> 01:25:57,310
It's not there like a thousand dollars worth of like DLC for the new one though

738
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:01,189
Yeah, and I I I could be wrong and this might be a completely wrong take

739
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:04,750
But when you look at that list of expansions to buy

740
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:10,970
Mm-hmm. I tell me if I'm wrong, but I could be wrong a chatter or you and everybody knows this

741
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:15,670
Like there's no just buy this all

742
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:21,729
There's no just like I want most of this there's no like bundles

743
01:26:21,729 --> 01:26:25,670
You have to like you have to do it. You have to individually purchase every fucking expansion. Am I wrong?

744
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:32,750
There's like 30 different things and like I going to the checkout and like here's your credit card info

745
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:38,670
Buy this one thing or two things, right? You have to buy you to add each thing individually to your cart

746
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:45,090
On steam apparently, is it actually on steam you can do it. That's I don't know. That's what my chat saying

747
01:26:45,869 --> 01:26:49,489
But then again chat has as we've mentioned before giving me bad advice

748
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:55,189
From time to time I wish they would do like a like a gold bundle like a platinum bundle or something

749
01:26:55,189 --> 01:26:59,590
I mean why I there's like 50 expansions that have to add each one individually

750
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:06,789
That's a first-world problem. Oh

751
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:10,829
Boy, I have all this money burning a hole in my pocket

752
01:27:11,789 --> 01:27:19,250
How do I buy more Sims content? I need adult babies expansion. Oh hell yeah adult diapers

753
01:27:20,289 --> 01:27:25,199
How do I buy the nursing home expansion, please?

754
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:31,640
That is really such a good fucking non-concern it really is

755
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:38,439
I don't want to click a button individually and place it in what I want to buy all thousand dollars worth this right now

756
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:41,079
Wait, why can't I?

757
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:48,949
Do they do have some like weird stuff in that expansion list by the way

758
01:27:50,409 --> 01:27:53,409
Is there clown stuff? I don't probably

759
01:27:54,189 --> 01:27:58,760
All right, cuz I I kind of like clown stuff like that would be perfect

760
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:03,600
Yeah, I'm looking through it's just like oh like my first gerbil like what okay?

761
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:06,399
I'm we get

762
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:11,069
Come on one more, and then we live one more, and then we live we got this I

763
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,640
believe in us

764
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,840
Quota met now we live

765
01:28:19,869 --> 01:28:21,869
Robin fucking bomb

766
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:34,079
Please we got this

767
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,880
Now picture this on higher difficulties

768
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,520
I feel like we're on the higher difficulty

769
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,930
We're not we just lost hacker. That's right. She's just that good

770
01:28:46,449 --> 01:28:51,050
That's right. We did lose the best player

771
01:28:53,609 --> 01:28:57,170
So getting we got double high tide okay? What's up, Joe?

772
01:28:57,170 --> 01:29:00,489
I think somebody's asking if I'm gonna play Breath of Wild after this probably yeah

773
01:29:00,489 --> 01:29:03,369
I'm as long as I still feel okay really I'll be all right

774
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:08,479
I'll do like

775
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:10,310
me see

776
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:12,069
How long we've been going for?

777
01:29:12,069 --> 01:29:14,170
Yeah, it's not over in a half. It's all up to like one

778
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:19,189
Um I don't think we're gonna get chorizo for a while, so maybe I'll just do like one more. Yeah

779
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:23,369
Okay, I mean I did for those who that don't know I did just like

780
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:28,220
Send a message to Vinny being like hey. Do you want to stream today? Yeah?

781
01:29:28,939 --> 01:29:33,800
I was like can you do it in an hour? Yeah, it was I listen man

782
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,199
I'm happy to do so we've been talking about doing this for a little while

783
01:29:36,199 --> 01:29:42,159
So I'm happy we get the chance like collaborate, but I was actually recording a Star Fox mod

784
01:29:42,779 --> 01:29:48,699
Like a Star Fox rom hack like I was about to hit record, and then you messaged me

785
01:29:48,699 --> 01:29:51,399
And then I was like all right well that's gonna be put off till later

786
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,239
So no, it's all good. It's all good. I'm happy to do this. This is this is good

787
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:59,340
Yeah, and I'm sure we'll

788
01:29:59,899 --> 01:30:05,500
See you again for the next couple of days whatever we do of the longest tomorrow or whatever we do more VR

789
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:10,020
That's gonna be coming also. It's gonna be fucked up. It's gonna be cool, but

790
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:14,840
Did you do among us VR in VR chat ever?

791
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:20,880
Yeah, I have never even opened the video game among us. I don't I don't even know what it is I

792
01:30:22,119 --> 01:30:24,119
Swear to God I have no

793
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:31,020
That of all the things that you could have been known for outside of like a wider reach of the Internet

794
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,760
It's a game. You've never played. It's unbelievable no

795
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,680
And that's why it's tomorrow's one day only

796
01:30:38,579 --> 01:30:44,170
Well, so here's the thing chat. There's a chance. I may do among us VR

797
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:47,369
I'm not sure because I have a studio day, and we're finishing up recording

798
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:52,109
Some stuff so I don't want to

799
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:57,189
Miss that and then there's other variables too like I you know if it's like a full server

800
01:30:57,189 --> 01:31:00,430
I'm not gonna bully my way in you know what I mean, but at the same time

801
01:31:01,149 --> 01:31:05,829
There's almost a 100% guarantee. I'm gonna do among us VR in the future if not tomorrow

802
01:31:06,609 --> 01:31:10,609
Just to let my chat know because they've been asking for a while too. Oh fuck

803
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:15,260
Vinny you killed two of your teammates

804
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:19,460
What these hamburger fucking grill things pissing me off?

805
01:31:24,529 --> 01:31:31,539
There's no pink. That's okay. We just gotta live now

806
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,340
fucking bad you know idea

807
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:41,770
Hey, Jeremiah. I don't want to like peek too far behind the curtain

808
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:46,850
But I want to ask you one very important question if you if you want to answer on stream or not that's fine

809
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:53,000
But is it difficult to hire clowns um actually kind of yeah

810
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,210
Okay

811
01:31:56,210 --> 01:32:02,199
Although the thing is a lot of that you would hire to that's a clown a lot of times

812
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,800
They're they do a lot of other stuff

813
01:32:05,439 --> 01:32:12,899
So some people have their side gig well. It's not it's just like a performance right performing. Yeah, and a lot of these

814
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,060
a lot of the more

815
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:21,359
They have like more than one thing so like oh, yeah, I need to there is a clown that I'm hiring a clown

816
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:22,760
You are a clown

817
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:27,119
No, you might be somebody that can be a clown, but you're also like a magician

818
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:32,699
You're also like a fucking like incredibly talented like contortionist and like dancer

819
01:32:33,079 --> 01:32:37,680
Right, it's not just like oh you are something yeah, right

820
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:43,520
Yeah, I would imagine you'd need to if you're gonna be that kind of entertainer you have to diversify your portfolio

821
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:49,579
So you can get more work because I mean how often are people having clown baseball games, you know?

822
01:32:50,859 --> 01:32:52,859
Not very often I would imagine

823
01:32:53,659 --> 01:32:55,829
but yeah, it's

824
01:32:55,829 --> 01:33:00,550
If you're looking for like a clown you should be looking for like almost like a performance group

825
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:06,109
Okay, for like a performer that is more hold on. I have to save somebody's life

826
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:08,720
Okay

827
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:17,189
Yeah, it's easier to find somebody that can do a clown if you need a clown rather than just searching for a

828
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,750
Young I need a just clown right like this is my life and identity is clown. Yeah

829
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:24,909
Okay

830
01:33:24,909 --> 01:33:30,270
Also area to depends. I know there's a lot of cities that are a lot less in the performing arts

831
01:33:31,109 --> 01:33:36,909
Yeah, so like Vegas is probably easier to get clown than New York City. Well, New York City's got like kind of everything

832
01:33:36,909 --> 01:33:39,109
I feel like I feel like New York would be wouldn't be hard

833
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,630
Yeah, I

834
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:45,029
Mean we do have a store that specifically sells like clown outfits

835
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:51,439
So you do yeah, we do we do it's not it's like a costume shop

836
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:55,359
Oh, like it's just a massive costume shop and they have plenty of clown outfits

837
01:33:56,359 --> 01:33:59,029
Because I had to me and my friend Mike

838
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:03,960
We were clowns for the back of one of our albums

839
01:34:04,819 --> 01:34:07,569
We had to buy clown outfits like

840
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,850
six years ago

841
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:13,869
So yeah, there you can get them but I was invincible if I did that

842
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:25,260
Chat I'm not telling you why I may hire a clown

843
01:34:25,939 --> 01:34:32,939
That's part of the fun. But you know, maybe one day it will come to fruition. Maybe it won't

844
01:34:33,819 --> 01:34:38,159
Maybe I'm just clowning around. I feel like New York would be pretty easy

845
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:45,460
I mean you can hire like a lot of different types of entertainers

846
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:50,439
Yeah, New York's a big entertainment city. Yeah, we are. Yeah, we have everything

847
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:54,819
Holy what just happened? Who just Boo-Yah? Oh

848
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,739
It's getting tough. Where are you? I think

849
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:02,060
I'm here. So we may need to start

850
01:35:02,859 --> 01:35:04,859
Yeah, I'll throw some ultimates

851
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:26,579
Damnit was busy boo-yahing. You got three. Oh my yes. There's plenty on the map. It's just impossible

852
01:35:27,779 --> 01:35:33,079
To like get them over there right now. There's so many that are there we could still do it

853
01:35:33,699 --> 01:35:37,470
We just need some depositors

854
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:44,020
Mary no, no, he was dead for a while. This is the worst platoon gameplay of all time

855
01:35:44,699 --> 01:35:49,569
No, I played worse. Um, you need to kill the boss is closer to the basket. Yeah, that makes sense

856
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:53,689
Well, Jerma before I go out, I'll tell you one more little story

857
01:35:55,409 --> 01:35:59,050
There's like a famous clown story I have about a stapler clown

858
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:06,239
Did you ever like see a performer who would have people staple money to their chests? No

859
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,770
You mean like I was at a bar

860
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:14,390
Yeah, like so I was at a bar one night and

861
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:20,909
Going back years ago and there was a clown who his whole act was, you know

862
01:36:20,909 --> 01:36:26,149
They did sword swallowing and juggling and stuff and the cloud the usual clown stuff. It's kind of smelly

863
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:30,500
Like like he kind of stunk the place up. So he was like a smelly cloud

864
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:33,380
I don't know if that was part of the act but at one point

865
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:39,619
He said if anyone wants to I got a stapler here my lovely clown assistant will help you

866
01:36:39,619 --> 01:36:41,619
I've got if you want

867
01:36:42,039 --> 01:36:44,039
$10 you can staple it to my chest

868
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:48,920
You know for $50 you can staple it to my stomach for a hundred you can staple it to my

869
01:36:49,479 --> 01:36:51,479
nether nether region what

870
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,680
Jerma I witnessed a clown's

871
01:36:55,399 --> 01:36:56,760
You know

872
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:03,039
So wait, it's in so the so the idea here. The idea here is that yeah, it's like you that you're paying

873
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:06,960
That's like he keeps the money. That's like are you stapled to me? I keep it. Yes

874
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,779
Once it's stapled to him he has it and I don't think you'd want to touch it again after no

875
01:37:12,779 --> 01:37:18,500
Just trying to get the service, you know what what he was doing the stick whatever it was, right? That's that's so

876
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:20,960
Somebody's he stapled it to his

877
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:27,970
Yeah, like his batwing he would batwing and he would let you staple it there, but it had to be like a hundred bucks

878
01:37:27,970 --> 01:37:35,899
What is the batwing? Well, it's like kind of when like you stretch out

879
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:39,319
The skin and

880
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:46,750
It looks like a batwing like like Batman. So he would stretch it out for you

881
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:49,649
He would batwing it and then he would let you staple it

882
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:53,880
Like to that yeah

883
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:59,199
It's good living I guess so and somebody did this

884
01:37:59,739 --> 01:38:03,260
Yeah, I watched it. It's real. I've seen it and Nari in fact in my chat

885
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:08,979
There's a video there are multiple videos of this clown or similar clowns that exists

886
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:11,579
I

887
01:38:11,579 --> 01:38:18,100
Don't know why I'm telling you this German. I'm sorry, but I just thought like we're talking about clowns. Let me just yes

888
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:24,670
I felt like you needed to know because like so I'm trying to understand like the the how does this come up?

889
01:38:24,989 --> 01:38:29,189
Like it was somebody did somebody like hire this person or was he just kind of like hey

890
01:38:29,189 --> 01:38:31,189
You could staple shit to me for money

891
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:36,270
Yeah, so that's a weird thing because this bar I used to go to before it closed down

892
01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:40,250
They just had like musicians usually just you know music but this night

893
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:45,470
I was there with friends and the clown was there and we were like what the fuck so

894
01:38:45,909 --> 01:38:50,270
We see the act and he's like throwing the swords, and he's you know juggling

895
01:38:50,270 --> 01:38:54,229
Okay, all right, and then about an hour later. He goes all right

896
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:58,300
now we're gonna close the doors and have some real fun and

897
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:00,920
then he

898
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:07,430
Like literally closed the doors and gave us his terms and conditions about like stapling money to him

899
01:39:08,229 --> 01:39:10,229
What the fuck?

900
01:39:10,229 --> 01:39:11,609
Yeah

901
01:39:11,609 --> 01:39:17,109
I'll link you to a video. You know what don't watch it. I'll link you anyway. Don't watch this

902
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:18,989
Yeah

903
01:39:18,989 --> 01:39:20,989
That's okay

904
01:39:21,029 --> 01:39:22,640
All right

905
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,380
well

906
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:25,699
Sorry

907
01:39:25,699 --> 01:39:30,300
Anyway, hey, maybe maybe we'll see you tomorrow the next day or something from here

Like for among us or for like anything

01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,630
Okay, dude when I hook up VR, it's the only thing I do for like a week
