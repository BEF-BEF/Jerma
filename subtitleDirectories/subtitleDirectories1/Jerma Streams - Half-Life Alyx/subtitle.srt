1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:08,880
Yeah, Half-Life Alex. Half-Life Alex. I've been waiting about a year, waiting a while to play Half-Life Alex.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,829
I told you, everybody thought I was gonna take a day off today. No, I'm here. After yesterday, I was a little tight, yes.

3
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:25,800
But I'm not taking a day off. I got VR to play. Though in an hour and ten minutes when this stream has to turn off,

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,420
we can both be right. How does that sound?

5
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:43,219
How you guys doing? Hope you're doing well. How drunk is he?

6
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:50,329
Ugh. On a scale of one to ten? Maybe like, like seven?

7
00:00:52,299 --> 00:01:02,969
Yeah, it's like, it's like two fifteen, guys. I'm obviously a seven right now. No, I'm drunk. I've got a coffee in my hands.

8
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:17,319
You're always a seven. Don't play the, don't play Alex on the Vive. Well, this is, what, I'm sorry.

9
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,920
I'm the sorry bastard that got the Wii

10
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:32,069
and have to play the shitty version of the AAA games. They're called Call of Duty 3 on the Xbox.

11
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,569
Call of Duty 3 on the Wii was like an N64 game. I have the Wii version of all these AAA games.

12
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:52,299
Or they just make a party game. And they do, oh, Assassin's Creed for the Xbox 360.

13
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:59,180
Hi, 1080p graphics. And then they make the one for the Wii. Assassin's Creed, where's the party?

14
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:12,949
And there's bowling. I, I had to play that one. And they all have like big heads.

15
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,770
They all, they all got like big avat, like Wii avatar heads.

16
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,949
But me, sorry, me, sorry. Please play Assassin's Creed Wii bowling.

17
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:41,289
Oh, big head tennis. Don't make fun of my weird mannerisms. I'm aware of them.

18
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:50,599
Remember, anytime I'm about to say something, I say, oh, oh, and, and, oh, oh, I know that.

19
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:57,830
Like it's been made, people have told me that a thousand times. I know. Oh, oh, it even bleeds

20
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:07,909
into other characters. Dick Bugleberry. It's just like, oh, and, oh, oh, I can't help it.

21
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,439
I just, it's, it's a filler word. When are you going to play Chubby Bunny? I'm not playing

22
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,159
Chubby Bunny right now. I'm doing Half-Life Alex, the most anticipated virtual game

23
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,770
since the second one came out. Now, a lot of people were like hyped up for this game.

24
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:31,159
I kind of wasn't. So I'm going in with completely just basic expectations.

25
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:44,120
I'm really not hyped up about this at all. So I'm not a liar. I swear to God. I, I, I,

26
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,960
I have to be completely honest with you guys. I kind of don't even care that I'm playing this

27
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,729
right now. I've made sure to not give a shit because I want to be either blown away or not.

28
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,810
Like, I don't want it to, I got to have my expectations. Like, I don't care, right? I've

29
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,139
been telling myself, no, you don't fucking care. Who cares? It's a dumb game. Who cares?

30
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:14,069
You're going to get blown to hell. Get the other controllers. I got the Wii controllers,

31
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,259
all right? What's wrong with you? What do you mean what's wrong? What's wrong with you?

32
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:26,860
Why are you saying that? Here we are. And just in case you didn't know,

33
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:38,139
just in case you didn't know, I'm on Twitch. Do you ever think, I've, no, I've already talked

34
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,459
about this. I already went over, like, if the doctor went to the drive-through with his doctor's

35
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:47,430
coat on. Like, I don't like to wear this shit anywhere besides, like, in front of the camera

36
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:56,180
here. Because people see the shirt and they go, you Twitch? Twitch, huh? And I'm just like, oh,

37
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:07,000
yeah, I'm a fan. I don't even, I like, I stole this. I stole this shirt. It's like, if a doctor

38
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,879
goes to like a drive-through at Dunkin' Donuts and he wears his lab coat, they're going to be like,

39
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:22,149
you're a doctor? Yeah, yeah, fuck, I forgot I had this on. No, no, I'm an engineer. I don't do that.

40
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:31,850
Somebody said nice bulge. Oh, that's funny. That you can literally not see below my waist right now.

41
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:44,790
And that guy for 20 minutes. Like, you mean this? Is that what you mean? Is that the thing

42
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:54,139
you're describing? Because, I mean, that's there. That's what we mean. Right, okay. He's got a dad

43
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:05,850
bod? I'm not 20. I'm not even 25. I'm not even 30. I look good for 35, okay? You can see the outline

44
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:14,069
of my breasticles. Don't you know that means that's a good thing for a 35-year-old? I can do this.

45
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:25,939
And I can do this. That actually kind of hurt. I know I shouldn't do that. You know, if you tell

46
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:29,139
yourself that you look good in the mirror over and over again at some point, hey, guess what?

47
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,259
What's that? Oh, wow, that's the wart finger. No, it's not. It's covered up today. Sorry about that,

48
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:39,769
guys. No wart jokes today. All right, I'm ready. No more stalling. Wait, one more, one more sip

49
00:06:39,769 --> 00:07:00,089
of coffee. I don't want the thing to fly off. Oh, let me put it down on my coaster.

50
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:16,550
I like the bedroom of like an 11-year-old boy. You guys ready for Half-Life Alex or should I

51
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:28,629
continue? I'm going in. Close to going. Am I gonna get this shit good? Look, you get to stall

52
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:35,160
on a game like this. This is the plan for today. I'm not changing games. Like, I'm playing Half-Life

53
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,720
Alex until I can't breathe anymore, which would probably be in about an hour, two hours, three,

54
00:07:39,720 --> 00:08:03,129
I don't know, maybe four. You're a doomer. How would I be a doomer? Ready. God, it's been so

55
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:10,100
long since I've gone into the world of Half-Life. I forgot the whole story because it was seriously

56
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:20,920
like fucking 15 years ago. I can't wait to not even know fucking basic characters' names. Why is this

57
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:30,009
so tight? This hurts. Ow. This fucking hurts. I think I broke it from last night. I didn't even

58
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:46,279
care. Okay, I'm ready. You guys ready? Here we are. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Didn't I fuck with this

59
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:55,509
last night? 64, right? Show the settings. I'll show the settings in a second. Hold on. I can't

60
00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:06,759
even hear myself talk. Okay. Not quit. Show the settings. Sure. Okay. You wanna see? There. There

61
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:14,149
you go. There you go. Okay. Yeah, it's on low. I got a 1080. I can't even put that on medium,

62
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:30,899
I don't think. Here we go. Difficulty normal. Challenging combat. Very challenging. Easy. Wait,

63
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:40,169
there's a mode below easy? There's a story mode? Do you even play the game or do you just sit and

64
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:45,450
watch? That's actually kind of cool. All right, I'm doing normal. No, we're not doing hard.

65
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:51,799
That's not happening. Movement. Blink. Teleport to destinations with fast linear movement.

66
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:00,360
Move continuously based on your head orientation. Move continuously based on your hand orientation

67
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:19,379
or blink. It's no audio. What the fuck? Oh, sorry. Where the fuck is the mouse? There you go. Got it.

68
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:31,480
Okay, good. Wait, which one of these is better? Blink with head orientation. Is that the best one?

69
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:50,230
Blink sucks. Continuous hand. Continuous hand. Can I change this? Continuous head.

70
00:10:51,110 --> 00:11:04,409
Can I stop moving? Continuous head. Okay. Aim slot. S.O. 50. All right. Quiet. Here comes the

71
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:34,470
cutscene. Gotta go. Hello. That was not a good intro. Right. Do I get visited? Do I get visited

72
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,309
by a Gorgonaut? It's five years before the collapse of the Citadel and the death of Eli Vance.

73
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:50,220
Oh yeah. Object. Alex Vance. Age 19. Female. Affiliation. Human resistance. Current assignment.

74
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:59,370
A connoissance. Why are you here? This is like the third game they've made. Why? What are you

75
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:07,210
doing here? You don't jump. You don't watch like fucking Return of the Jedi first and then go,

76
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:21,980
wait, hold on. Darth Vader is just dead? Holy shit. Okay, low fidelity graphics. My ass. This

77
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:49,419
looks fantastic. What station does it have to be on? Push to move. Push. Whoa. Push snap. Turn left or

78
00:12:49,419 --> 00:13:07,940
right? Oh, that's okay. Pretty good fidelity, I think. You hit somebody. All of a sudden you

79
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:37,059
hear like. What's saying? Why am I acting like a caveman? That was just handed this. Who was this?

80
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:58,330
Oh, this make me angry. Oh, dude, sick. You got a fucking GTX 3090. What do I have to do?

81
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:20,389
What do I do? Crush the can. Oh, you can't. Isn't there like a fucking alien invasion?

82
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:47,159
Oh, incoming call. How do I turn on device? Oh, I hate that already. Metricot movement is normal.

83
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,200
Same for the combine patrols. How's it going in the stockyard?

84
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,740
One combine. Oh, I don't like that subtitle. They're never going to miss it. Here, see for yourself.

85
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,679
Someone's taken the combine construction network. Don't get greedy guys. We're not made of time here.

86
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:13,159
One minute and I'm out. Guaranteed. Oh, also I spotted the combine supplies into the quarantine

87
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:22,250
zone. That place has been deserted for years. That is all. Well, we'll look into it. Oh,

88
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:28,250
let's pay attention. Eat back at the safe house baby. Eat back at the safe house. What is it,

89
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:38,460
Russell? Is the game blinking? Is my character blinking? I keep seeing like a little like black

90
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:45,909
flash. Like flash. Like I'm blinking. And no, no, no, no, no. It's not me blinking in the headset.

91
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:59,289
Right? That's me. No, it's not. I'm telling you. All right. Let's go. Of course, you can.

92
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:24,379
What is he drawing? Me. Me. Me. Son. Explode. Wait, what's this? B 456 B pilon seven B.

93
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:36,919
I don't know. Do I need that information? I don't know. All right. Let's go meet in the safe house.

94
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:51,899
I'm telling you, the shit's blanking.

95
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,370
How do I get out of here?

96
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,450
Enable spectator mode.

97
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:06,980
It's too jerky.

98
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
Enable spectator.

99
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,980
I think it's already on.

100
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,799
Medium?

101
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,799
Turn on spectator.

102
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,210
Yeah, it's already on.

103
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,099
What button do I press?

104
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,099
Capture the game window.

105
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,099
Capture the game window.

106
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,099
Capture the game.

107
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,279
Isn't that what I'm doing?

108
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,960
We're capturing the wrong thing.

109
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,220
Capture game window.

110
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,220
Wait a minute.

111
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm coming out.

112
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm capping the VR view.

113
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,549
Should I not be doing that?

114
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:52,829
Capture the actual game engine.

115
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:54,990
Spectator mode shows us your ammo and shit.

116
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,680
Oh.

117
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,160
Wait a minute.

118
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Turn off the subtitles.

119
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Wait, hold on.

120
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,079
This is like a lot to take in right now.

121
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm doing the steam mirror thing.

122
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,799
So I just cap the actual game?

123
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:29,210
Like that.

124
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,970
So this is like the actual game being captured, not the VR window.

125
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:43,789
Okay.

126
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,420
The game is now being captured.

127
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,019
How do you actually get into the settings of the game?

128
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:52,019
What's the pause menu?

129
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:59,140
Left grip?

130
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,500
Oh, fuck yeah.

131
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
All right, let's go.

132
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,940
All right, now help me out here.

133
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,940
Options menu.

134
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,000
Spectator.

135
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, spectator camera.

136
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Okay.

137
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Spectator HUD.

138
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Medium.

139
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,839
Spectator smoothing low.

140
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,839
Spectator medium.

141
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,700
On high.

142
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Is that going to work?

143
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,609
Can my computer do this?

144
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,609
And turn off the subtitles.

145
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,609
Is that good?

146
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:46,059
All right.

147
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:49,099
Subtitles for spectator only.

148
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:51,920
Subtitles in closed captions.

149
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,700
Subtitles for spectator.

150
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,009
Subtitles on.

151
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:04,630
Subtitles spectator window only.

152
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

153
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay.

154
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,579
I didn't...

155
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:15,079
Well, there are a lot of settings in this fucking game.

156
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,789
I gotta check these cables.

157
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,789
Why am I getting a black light?

158
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:20,789
Everything's good.

159
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:30,579
Oh, because I dropped the headset on the ground last night.

160
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:31,579
What am I stupid?

161
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:32,619
All right, I'm ready.

162
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:35,140
Let's go.

163
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,750
It's playable.

164
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,500
All right, let's get out of here.

165
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,970
Is that better?

166
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,599
Out of the door.

167
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,309
Much better?

168
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:55,309
Okay.

169
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:56,619
Well, I didn't...

170
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:59,619
Every VR game I've ever played was just like plug it in and turn it on.

171
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:01,619
I didn't know there was like all these settings.

172
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:02,619
All right, let's go.

173
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:17,640
You can't see the chat?

174
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Oh, the fucking chat is now not viewable.

175
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:28,140
Okay, well, we'll deal with that later.

176
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,779
Oh, toggle game mode.

177
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:36,359
Right.

178
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,279
I would have said to walk down the stairs.

179
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,279
Okay, here we go.

180
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,420
Hey, it doesn't even matter.

181
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,420
Like, you guys...

182
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,420
What do you mean?

183
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,420
You guys can see the chat.

184
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
I just...

185
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,420
You guys are...

186
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
You guys are there.

187
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:57,309
Because every time I go like this, you just know that I'm looking at you.

188
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:04,400
All right, let's move.

189
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:15,750
Do my part!

190
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:25,670
All right, I'm going back in.

191
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,490
Well, that was fucking crazy.

192
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,799
I need the full audio experience.

193
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:34,799
Oh.

194
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:47,779
Oh, there's an alien in there.

195
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,420
Let him out?

196
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,009
Oh, let the alien out.

197
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:55,049
What are we looking at?

198
00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:04,220
Are we filming this?

199
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,720
Feed him.

200
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,289
Feed the baby.

201
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,289
Feed the baby.

202
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,289
Feed him with what?

203
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:13,289
This?

204
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:22,960
Oh!

205
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
I don't overfeed the fish.

206
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Don't overfeed...

207
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Some people just sit there and they just dump.

208
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
Over and over and over and over and over and over again.

209
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,849
Fuck it.

210
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:34,849
My stream is on.

211
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:39,519
Why is my video feed...

212
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,519
I just caught that.

213
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,519
Barely.

214
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:48,190
Right there, I saw, like, my stream playing.

215
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,009
All right, let's go.

216
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:53,490
Oh, shit.

217
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,490
I think it just hit you.

218
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,299
See?

219
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:02,980
Can I pull this down?

220
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,019
All right, whatever.

221
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:12,410
It wants me to aim it right there.

222
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,410
Is he standing there?

223
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:20,640
I think there's a person standing there.

224
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,390
Let me in!

225
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:38,990
He's got, like, a little finger.

226
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,990
All right, let's move.

227
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,740
Wait, wait, wait, where are we going?

228
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,180
Uh, I don't know.

229
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,180
This one?

230
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
This one.

231
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
This one.

232
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,420
That one.

233
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,420
The only one that works.

234
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
What?

235
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:59,589
Nobody can do more wire but him.

236
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:00,589
Alex!

237
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:01,589
Hey!

238
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:05,309
Are we good?

239
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:06,309
Yep, they got the reactor.

240
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,309
Easy peasy.

241
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:10,349
I'm headed back to the safe house right now to meet Dad.

242
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:12,349
The dinosaur DNA is in here.

243
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:13,349
Stay safe.

244
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:14,349
Hey!

245
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:15,349
Whoa!

246
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,349
Ow!

247
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:31,539
My hand!

248
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:34,700
Too much strength.

249
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Too much strength.

250
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,740
What's in here?

251
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
Documents.

252
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
All right, go.

253
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,819
We're under attack.

254
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:46,819
I have to, like, move my butt.

255
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:47,819
Alex, over here.

256
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,210
Hey!

257
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,210
What is it?

258
00:25:51,210 --> 00:26:00,700
This doesn't seem like a routine sweep.

259
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,009
Are you sure?

260
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:09,329
I don't know.

261
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:10,369
I have to, like, move my butt.

262
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,369
Alex, over here.

263
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,369
Hey!

264
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:13,369
What is it?

265
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:14,369
This doesn't seem like a routine sweep.

266
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:15,369
Are you sure everything went okay?

267
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:16,369
100 percent.

268
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:17,369
Okay, let's do a funny thing.

269
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:18,369
Get a camera.

270
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,369
I'll be like, hey, let me out of here.

271
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,369
Yoo-hoo!

272
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:23,269
Oh, yeah!

273
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:25,339
Here we go.

274
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:26,339
Didn't work.

275
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:27,339
Didn't work.

276
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:39,019
Didn't work.

277
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:47,230
Didn't work.

278
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,230
How do I run?

279
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,230
How do you run?

280
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,230
He's so slow.

281
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,839
What?

282
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,839
There we go.

283
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:55,839
Oh, my God.

284
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,240
I didn't see him.

285
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,990
Oh, shit.

286
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,990
Cargo.

287
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,990
Oh.

288
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:11,970
In there?

289
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,970
Door.

290
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,970
Store.

291
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,970
What?

292
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,970
Door.

293
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,970
Hey!

294
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,970
Hey!

295
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:27,269
I won't!

296
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:36,000
No, no, no, no, no!

297
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I just...

298
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,140
Ow!

299
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:49,019
Come on!

300
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:57,170
Fred.

301
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,170
Eat this?

302
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,170
Hey, I feel like something just popped up on my HUD.

303
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,170
What?

304
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,170
Oh, I eat cookies.

305
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,170
Oh, yeah.

306
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:13,150
Oh, yeah.

307
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,380
Oh, yeah.

308
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,660
Oh, yeah.

309
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,660
Oh, yeah.

310
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
Oh, yeah.

311
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Oh, I eat cookies.

312
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Thumbs up.

313
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
I ate it.

314
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:37,000
This is fucking...

315
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,779
OK, I'm going to fall.

316
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:58,829
And that's, ladies and gentlemen, what it would look like if bugs ruled the world.

317
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:03,829
If bugs were even 20% larger than they are now, that's the kind of shit we'd be dealing

318
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:04,829
with.

319
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:13,579
I would never leave my house, ever.

320
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:32,990
Should I bring this with me?

321
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,990
I need it.

322
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:47,009
All right.

323
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:48,009
It's just like Hitman.

324
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:49,819
It's just like fucking Hitman.

325
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:52,859
I got, like, my guns in here, and they're going to pat me down.

326
00:29:52,859 --> 00:30:07,240
I just got a delivery!

327
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
I just got a delivery!

328
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
I just live here!

329
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Shoot!

330
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:17,420
Pat me down.

331
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,420
I got a delivery for the mafia boss!

332
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:27,140
I didn't steal anything.

333
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,140
This just flowers for fuck's sake!

334
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
No one!

335
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
I didn't see anyone!

336
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
Quick, run!

337
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
Dear.

338
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:54,380
Nice posture.

339
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,099
Shut up.

340
00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:00,099
Give me a break.

341
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,140
Give me a break.

342
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,140
I got, like, a 12-pound thing on my head.

343
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:11,049
Where are you taking me?

344
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:12,049
This posture.

345
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:13,049
Where's my father?

346
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:15,309
Hello?

347
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,150
Damn it!

348
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,150
Where's my father?

349
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,609
Just stop moving around.

350
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:24,619
Asshole.

351
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:33,019
It's Wheatley!

352
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:36,019
Wheatley's coming to save us!

353
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:41,420
Sticks in his...

354
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,420
Sorry!

355
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
Sorry!

356
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
I didn't mean to...

357
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,789
Sorry!

358
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:59,450
Sorry!

359
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,450
Alex, run!

360
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,490
If you see something here, just be...

361
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,490
I'm sorry!

362
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,029
Nice.

363
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,029
PlayStation 2 gamer headset.

364
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:15,259
Russell?

365
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:16,259
I told you.

366
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:17,259
I've been in an accident.

367
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:18,259
I know!

368
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,259
I caused it.

369
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:20,259
So, technically, not an accident.

370
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:21,259
You've got to get moving.

371
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:22,259
Wait.

372
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:23,259
Wait.

373
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:24,259
Where's Dad?

374
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:25,259
He's fine.

375
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:26,259
Follow the drone.

376
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:33,710
It's Wheatley.

377
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,720
All right, let's go.

378
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,900
So, Dad's okay, right?

379
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Yeah.

380
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Well, no.

381
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
To be honest, he's in huge trouble.

382
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
But...

383
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,940
I still...

384
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,940
I can't help it.

385
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,940
I have to help him.

386
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
I need to have something in my hands.

387
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,940
I'm one of those weirdos.

388
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,940
I had no way of knowing who was in the window.

389
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,940
If I don't have something in my hand, I can't function.

390
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
Yes.

391
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
The result was that I saved you.

392
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
Do we know where they're taking him?

393
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
Criminal holding.

394
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,940
And then, when they realized he was Eli Vance,

395
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,740
they want to plan to get him back.

396
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,740
Hey.

397
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,740
You're close to my lab.

398
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,740
Keep following the drone.

399
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,740
What's true?

400
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,740
Bring up the jump indicator and release to jump.

401
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,740
Russell, what did you guys find back there?

402
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
Well, that's the crazy thing.

403
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
I don't know.

404
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,740
Just...

405
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:17,779
Just very picturesque building.

406
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:18,779
Citadel?

407
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,779
Something else.

408
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:20,779
And whatever it is...

409
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:27,009
Okay.

410
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:28,009
Jump indicator.

411
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:30,009
Russell, just hang on.

412
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,009
I'm almost there.

413
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:42,019
When do I get a gun?

414
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:49,250
Force push!

415
00:33:49,250 --> 00:34:03,740
Minus two.

416
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,130
Come on.

417
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,130
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

418
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,130
Can we get to play?

419
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,130
Can I play this with him?

420
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,130
Please tell me I can play this with him.

421
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,010
All right.

422
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,010
It's me versus you, chat.

423
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,010
Ready?

424
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:22,900
I'm X's UROs, okay?

425
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,199
Guess what?

426
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,210
It'll...

427
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:34,340
Okay.

428
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
I'm over it.

429
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,980
Wait, can I?

430
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:47,420
Ow!

431
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:54,519
And here's the best feature of the game.

432
00:34:54,519 --> 00:35:00,880
Hey!

433
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:08,789
Ah!

434
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:13,530
He's dead!

435
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:24,829
He didn't see us.

436
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:26,139
Oh, no.

437
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:27,139
It's the last...

438
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:31,139
It's the last remnant of Wheatley's chat piece.

439
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:45,090
What did that say?

440
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,030
I need that tutorial.

441
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,030
To mantle, push, and hold while moving.

442
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:58,739
Hello?

443
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:09,869
Hello, hello, hello?

444
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:11,869
Whoa, stop.

445
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,010
There was a phone on there.

446
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:20,369
It's too heavy.

447
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,369
Holy shit, this is like 50 pounds.

448
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,739
Secret entrance.

449
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:35,739
Okay, let's wait.

450
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,199
Nope, it exploded.

451
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,199
I'm fine, by the way.

452
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,440
Right.

453
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Let me get the tea.

454
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Okay.

455
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,750
I promise I'm your grandmother.

456
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,119
Russell.

457
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,400
They've got Dad.

458
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,579
I know.

459
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:57,579
This...

460
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:58,579
This is bad.

461
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:02,579
They're gonna find out what he knows and then, yeah, they're gonna kill him.

462
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,840
Oh, God.

463
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,840
But, the good news is, we've got something they don't.

464
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
Which is?

465
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
My plan to get him back.

466
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Great.

467
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
Let's hear it.

468
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Now, pretty soon they're gonna realize that your Dad is not gonna talk.

469
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
And when that happens, he's off to have his brain sucked out.

470
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
Russell.

471
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Potentially.

472
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
Maybe not, though.

473
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
I mean, they could just drill into his...

474
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Stop.

475
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Oh, yeah.

476
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Right.

477
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Well, what they will do is take a train from here...

478
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
What's happening?

479
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,880
This is Eli to Nova Prospect.

480
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,880
And if he gets on that train, that's it, right?

481
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
Not necessarily.

482
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Grab something that represents us.

483
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,139
It has some cool computers in here, man.

484
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:45,380
Grab something that represents us.

485
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:54,469
A teacup?

486
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:56,469
There's plenty of these around.

487
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:57,469
Of course, it's a teacup.

488
00:37:57,469 --> 00:37:58,469
Okay, that's you.

489
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:00,469
That's us.

490
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:01,469
I thought you said us.

491
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,510
Well, one of us, me, will have to stay here for this plan to work.

492
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,510
All right.

493
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,510
Fair enough.

494
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,510
Just outside, there's a second train that also leads out of 717 through the quarantine zone.

495
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,510
Okay.

496
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,510
Both trains intersect here at the Fairview Junction.

497
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,510
I'm ready to go.

498
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,510
Get there before this train and hack into the controls.

499
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,510
That'll let me take over the system.

500
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,510
Train comes to a halt, you deal with the Combine situation, and we get your Dad back.

501
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,510
Sounds good.

502
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,510
Where's the train I'm taking?

503
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,550
Out the back, through the yard.

504
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,550
Out the back, through the yard.

505
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,550
It's decommissioned, but I think I can hack into its controls.

506
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,550
Oh, and get yourself a pair of Russells on the way out.

507
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,550
Anybody else feel like this is two people under a train show?

508
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,550
Alex, you know, the Gravity Clubs.

509
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,550
I have a few sets through there.

510
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,550
You can calibrate them out by the ship.

511
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,550
Got it.

512
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,550
We can do this, Alex.

513
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,860
You got that, didn't you?

514
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,860
Though I said we could do it.

515
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,860
All right, here we go.

516
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,860
Yeah, we are.

517
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,860
Oh, yeah.

518
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,860
This is where you get the portal gun.

519
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:03,380
Oh, shit.

520
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Oh, I...

521
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:07,619
That's hard.

522
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:08,619
You guys take that up.

523
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:09,619
I can't see that.

524
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:15,960
You guys are in the way.

525
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
All right, I'll do it.

526
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
What am I touching?

527
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,619
Back up.

528
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:27,619
Time to get a gun?

529
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:39,739
Can't even get the light bulb.

530
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:40,739
The game's not even good.

531
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,059
I missed it.

532
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:45,059
You missed it.

533
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,789
What?

534
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:52,019
Did I miss something?

535
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:53,019
Did I miss?

536
00:39:55,219 --> 00:39:56,219
I missed it.

537
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,110
I thought that was really the wall right next to me.

538
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,110
It's the same color as the wall.

539
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,110
I thought that was the wall in my house.

540
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,150
All right, you know how this goes.

541
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,150
There should be a bunch of junk down there.

542
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,150
Aim at something with your hand open.

543
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,719
What?

544
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,750
You're attached.

545
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:30,539
Make a grip.

546
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:31,539
Now target something with the rustles.

547
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,420
Target it.

548
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,730
Close your hand.

549
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,730
Register it.

550
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:38,730
Now flick your wrist to bring it in.

551
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,730
Catch it.

552
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,780
Try again.

553
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,780
That's it.

554
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,780
That's cool.

555
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,860
One more time.

556
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Yep, you did it.

557
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,219
Make a grip.

558
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:52,219
You've got it.

559
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,219
Just a little flick of the wrist.

560
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:54,219
Just like that.

561
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,219
Perfect, we're done.

562
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,260
Oh, wait.

563
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
I almost forgot.

564
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,260
Alex, up here.

565
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,260
You're going to need a gun.

566
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,260
Don't worry.

567
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
It's unloaded.

568
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:05,320
It's unloaded now.

569
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,260
Oh, almost forgot.

570
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,260
Guns need ammo.

571
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
I really could have used that bullet, Ted.

572
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Force push.

573
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,539
Got it.

574
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:21,219
Press button or pull slide to do it.

575
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:25,699
How much ammo do I have?

576
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:41,690
I have a lot of ammo?

577
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,690
What was the last thing you said?

578
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,110
At the gnome.

579
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:54,150
Where?

580
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,150
Oh, shit.

581
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,150
Hold on.

582
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,150
There's an herb here.

583
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,150
Resident Evil told me I could eat these.

584
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:11,539
This is no.

585
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:12,539
What do you want me to do?

586
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:13,969
Where's my gun?

587
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,099
Where are you?

588
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:27,099
Where are you guys?

589
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:28,719
Okay.

590
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:29,719
Move cam top right.

591
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:30,719
Let's see if I can do it.

592
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:38,090
And go.

593
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,090
Got it.

594
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,090
I got it.

595
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,059
I actually got it.

596
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:45,059
Well, okay.

597
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:46,059
So what does he want me to do?

598
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:47,059
Shoot at his...

599
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:48,059
Shoot in his window?

600
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:51,139
What does he want me to do?

601
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:56,320
Jump over this?

602
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,320
Can I be able to vault over this?

603
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:09,300
Am I blind?

604
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,340
Well, that, that, that, that, that.

605
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
Okay.

606
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
I don't know where the gnome is, guys.

607
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:18,440
All right.

608
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Shoot this lock off.

609
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,130
Nice.

610
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,300
Oh, you took care of that lock then.

611
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,300
Good.

612
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,670
Great.

613
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,670
Did have the key for it.

614
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,670
But should have given you that.

615
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,670
More ammo in backpack.

616
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:39,079
That didn't work?

617
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:42,429
Okay.

618
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:47,130
There we go.

619
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,130
All right.

620
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,130
Here we go.

621
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,130
Next stop, Fairview Junction.

622
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,130
How do you reload?

623
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,130
And good luck, Alex.

624
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,130
Goodbye.

625
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:57,329
Obviously, just to let you know,

626
00:43:57,329 --> 00:43:58,329
I am still here though.

627
00:43:58,329 --> 00:43:59,329
I know.

628
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:04,130
Okay.

629
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:08,380
Oh, it's a load.

630
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,380
It is a cool loading screen.

631
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:11,809
It shows you the entire Sim,

632
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:12,809
Sim City area.

633
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:14,809
City Skylines.

634
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:15,809
Whatever.

635
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:16,809
You think this city is better

636
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:17,809
built than anything I build

637
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:18,809
in City Skylines?

638
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:19,809
Look at this.

639
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:20,809
What's the traffic doing over there?

640
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:23,239
What kind of roads are these?

641
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:24,239
Look at...

642
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:25,239
Oh, curved roads.

643
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:26,239
Oh, mega-lull.

644
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,239
Give me a break.

645
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,239
And I get shit for how I design a city?

646
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:33,099
Don't see the loading screen though.

647
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:42,280
Hello, Alex?

648
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
We might have a problem.

649
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
Probably nothing to worry about, but...

650
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,739
I'm just...

651
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:48,739
Did the train stop?

652
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,340
It stopped, didn't it?

653
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,340
Yeah.

654
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,340
What happened?

655
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,340
Oh, it's jammed.

656
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,340
When the Combine shut down

657
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,340
the quarantine zone,

658
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,340
they must have tightened security.

659
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,340
Which means?

660
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,340
Yeah, you're nowhere near

661
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,340
Fairview Junction.

662
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,340
You're just outside the QZ.

663
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,340
And this is as far as

664
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,340
we get by train.

665
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,340
Then I'm headed on foot.

666
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Good.

667
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,340
I'll see if I can get you

668
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,340
in some other way.

669
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,340
Here we go.

670
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,079
Are you guys going to stand up?

671
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:20,079
There's a dead zombie here.

672
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,079
I thought the Combine

673
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,079
sealed up the QZ.

674
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,079
Oh.

675
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:25,340
This one must have...

676
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,380
with barnacle spores

677
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,380
outside the containment area.

678
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,739
Probably not a one-off then.

679
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:31,739
Oh, so you can pick them up?

680
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:32,739
I doubt it.

681
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:36,579
Press to bring up jump indicator

682
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:37,579
or at least...

683
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:44,739
I don't think this is going to stand up

684
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:45,739
and I'm going to have to shoot it.

685
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:51,210
I'll go that way.

686
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,210
That looks dangerous.

687
00:45:53,210 --> 00:46:00,510
Wait.

688
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,389
Ooh!

689
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:03,389
That's...

690
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:14,489
I'm not going to be very good at that.

691
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:15,489
Perch the environment

692
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:16,489
for useful items.

693
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:17,489
Ooh, what's this?

694
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:20,690
Would you look at that?

695
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,690
And if there's resin around here

696
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,690
there should be a Combine fabricator.

697
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:24,690
Keep an eye out.

698
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,690
We might be able to upgrade

699
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,690
your firepower a bit.

700
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,730
Really?

701
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:28,730
This upgrades?

702
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:35,769
Wait, was I supposed to wait

703
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:41,489
for somebody?

704
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:42,489
Key plots?

705
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:43,489
Do not enter.

706
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:45,239
All right, this is...

707
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,239
I know something's going to

708
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:47,239
fucking jump out.

709
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:48,239
They don't give you the gauntlet.

710
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,239
When the guy comes in

711
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,239
the one enemy you have to kill.

712
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:56,639
I think I can reroute this

713
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:57,639
with my multi-tool.

714
00:46:57,639 --> 00:46:58,639
Your what?

715
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:00,639
It's a tool with multiple functions.

716
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:02,639
So, you know, multi-tool.

717
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:05,840
Oh, it's...

718
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,840
Okay.

719
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,840
Use multi-tool.

720
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:14,179
This is cool.

721
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,179
All right, did I just turn the power on?

722
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:21,619
Did I not do it long enough?

723
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,130
Hold on.

724
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,130
Oh, it's a puzzle game play.

725
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,130
Alex, that thing's incredible.

726
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,219
Something that really sells it.

727
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,460
Who am I going to sell it to?

728
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,460
I'm not telling you.

729
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,460
The Combine's not going to be here forever.

730
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,460
You should be thinking

731
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,460
about the future, Alex.

732
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,460
Well, how about I call it...

733
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,460
His step ladder.

734
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,460
The...

735
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,460
Alex.

736
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:47,019
It's a little derivative of the Russells,

737
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:49,019
but yeah, provisionally, sure.

738
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:50,019
The Alex.

739
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:51,019
Yeah.

740
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:53,579
Sweaty ears.

741
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,130
I gotta reroute the power

742
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:00,690
from here.

743
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,420
Hold on.

744
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,420
Oh, just like in Saw.

745
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,019
Fucking Saw.

746
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:11,260
Why is it...

747
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,260
Russells.

748
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,260
The Combine use these.

749
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,260
Are they safe for people?

750
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,260
Yeah, I use them all the time.

751
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,260
Wait, what just happened?

752
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,260
Yeah, they're great.

753
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,260
Ow.

754
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:33,260
Hey, you were right.

755
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,260
These are great.

756
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:40,110
You got a flashlight?

757
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:48,130
You have to quickly switch to and from your hand.

758
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,750
Heavy objects with both hands.

759
00:48:52,750 --> 00:49:05,579
Don't touch everything.

760
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:07,579
I'm touching every single object

761
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:08,579
in the whole game world.

762
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:15,489
Oh, careful of that barnacle, Alex.

763
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,239
Oh, these things are in the game?

764
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:21,239
Oh, I hated these in Half-Life.

765
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,440
Oh.

766
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:45,099
Is that right?

767
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:46,099
Yeah.

768
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,590
First try.

769
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,590
They said try again in a year.

770
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,590
I don't need to tell you

771
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,630
what happened after that.

772
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,630
Lucky break for me, really.

773
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,090
First try, guys.

774
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,090
Honestly, it's a miracle

775
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,780
you and your dad got out of it.

776
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,780
All right, watch out.

777
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,670
Don't touch that.

778
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:21,280
Something moved in there.

779
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:24,670
Come here, come here.

780
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:26,670
I need you.

781
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,539
I need you for a minute.

782
00:50:31,539 --> 00:50:32,539
Get it.

783
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:33,539
Did you get it?

784
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:36,030
He doesn't want it.

785
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,059
He's like, eww, gross.

786
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:47,000
That's a dead body, dude.

787
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:58,199
Get him.

788
00:50:58,199 --> 00:50:59,199
What are you holding on to?

789
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:00,239
Throw that.

790
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:02,239
Put it down.

791
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:04,989
Take him.

792
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:07,000
Take him.

793
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Take it.

794
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,610
Come on.

795
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,360
I'm about to throw this guy out of the bar.

796
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:21,250
Oh, God damn it.

797
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,179
What happened?

798
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:40,670
What's going on?

799
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,670
Where am I?

800
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,090
I just see a sun setting.

801
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:55,559
I think I'm in the ceiling.

802
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:07,659
You're out of the play zone.

803
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:16,019
I got eaten.

804
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:18,019
I got eaten by the barnacle,

805
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:21,059
Did I touch it and then just get sucked straight up?

806
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:24,969
Hey!

807
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:38,679
It doesn't miss.

808
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:45,139
Shit, I need that.

809
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:47,139
I need that.

810
00:52:48,139 --> 00:53:15,000
This is the worst ride at Disney World.

811
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,860
I need to reset.

812
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,860
I need those things.

813
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:28,550
I sucked one of those upgrade stones into the thing's head and it destroyed it.

814
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:30,550
I need that thing.

815
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:36,099
I don't want to shoot it because that's a waste of money.

816
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:37,099
That's a waste of ammo.

817
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:46,570
Careful of that barnacle, Alex.

818
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:56,679
Okay, I'm ready.

819
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:58,679
Yeah.

820
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,239
Where am I?

821
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,239
I interviewed at Black Mesa.

822
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:05,239
They said try again in a year.

823
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,820
I'm not going to fuck this up.

824
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:13,539
Honestly, it's a miracle you and your dad got out of it.

825
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:15,539
Give me that thing.

826
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:24,800
Oh, shit.

827
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,619
I have to shoot them.

828
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:31,659
What?

829
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:37,130
Fuck.

830
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,500
Give me that.

831
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,500
Don't touch anything.

832
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,639
I missed the resin?

833
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:44,639
What?

834
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:45,639
No, I didn't.

835
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:48,289
Where?

836
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:52,539
Where's the resin?

837
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,539
Oh, right.

838
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:59,769
All right, we're good.

839
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:08,900
Here we go.

840
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,900
Ready?

841
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,940
What the fuck?

842
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:17,630
Can I get in here?

843
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:25,079
No, wrong fucking guy.

844
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,079
Should I shoot?

845
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:46,820
Kill it?

846
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,820
How do I reload the gun?

847
00:55:50,659 --> 00:56:01,880
Let's go.

848
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,590
Finally.

849
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:26,010
Quiet.

850
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,050
I mean, it is quiet.

851
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,539
I'm going to get ambushed.

852
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:30,539
How many do I have in this gun?

853
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:31,539
Six.

854
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:33,539
I take it the quarantine zone is behind this hatch?

855
00:56:34,539 --> 00:56:35,539
Yeah, yeah, that's where they keep it.

856
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:38,099
Look around for a control panel.

857
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:40,099
Oh, no, no control panel.

858
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:42,099
Shoot that thing and it'll go ding!

859
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,099
It'll turn to green.

860
00:56:45,099 --> 00:56:47,300
I mean, it was worth the shot.

861
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:56,539
I didn't even know I was back there.

862
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:14,849
I can't wait to upgrade.

863
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:15,849
This is going to be so much fun.

864
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:17,849
What about anything over here?

865
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:25,679
The combine?

866
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:26,679
Where would I put a control panel?

867
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,860
Oh, does that hurt?

868
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:38,710
Is shit in here?

869
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:46,630
These things are everywhere.

870
00:57:48,579 --> 00:57:49,579
This is like an Easter egg hunt.

871
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:53,099
This is awesome.

872
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:17,590
I hear a bug.

873
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,110
Why am I looking in the toilet?

874
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,110
What the fuck is wrong with me?

875
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,110
I thought that was going to be a resin stone.

876
00:58:30,829 --> 00:58:31,829
I got a lot of these.

877
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,420
My face is itchy.

878
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,239
That's a bad sign.

879
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:44,239
Is this how the speedrunners do this game?

880
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:52,690
Okay, we're looking for a control panel.

881
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:53,730
That's it right there, isn't it?

882
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,820
Climb this.

883
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,420
Control panel.

884
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,420
Wait, wait, wait.

885
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,780
I have a tool.

886
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:12,199
I feel like I'm struck by lightning doing this.

887
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:14,199
This is like a Chevy Chase movie.

888
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:16,199
Oh, I got it.

889
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:18,199
I'm just trying to get a signal.

890
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:20,199
Yikes!

891
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,500
What do I do?

892
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,500
That up there?

893
00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:28,789
Harry Potter joke incoming.

894
00:59:29,789 --> 00:59:30,789
What do you mean by Harry?

895
00:59:31,789 --> 00:59:33,480
That's a control panel right here.

896
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:34,519
This is electricity, right here.

897
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,079
This is an electricity panel.

898
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:55,820
What the hell is this?

899
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,300
Look with your special eyes.

900
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,690
Aren't I doing that?

901
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:06,309
This is definitely a control panel.

902
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:08,489
Absolutely.

903
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:10,659
It has a handle on it.

904
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:13,739
Look, it's got a handle on it.

905
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,170
Am I dead?

906
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:28,380
Follow the wire.

907
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,380
I think I may have found it.

908
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:52,539
Oh, you grabbed me, you resin evil.

909
01:00:53,539 --> 01:01:02,340
Yep, up there.

910
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:15,460
Wait, I keep climbing the window.

911
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,460
Oh, you're alive?

912
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,320
Oh, that's me making that noise.

913
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,320
I need this window, dude.

914
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,329
Wait a minute.

915
01:01:28,329 --> 01:01:30,210
Stay right there.

916
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:32,210
And before your very eyes,

917
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,210
I'm going to take the dollar out of your pocket

918
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,210
and put it in your girlfriend's.

919
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,210
Can you believe it?

920
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,210
Street magic with Gerber 985.

921
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:45,519
I'll get it, sir.

922
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,300
Not what I'm supposed to do?

923
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:09,250
Fuck.

924
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,699
Can I just push it?

925
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:17,699
Oh my god, oh my god, I can't use this.

926
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:33,869
Ah, a lot of shit in here.

927
01:02:34,869 --> 01:02:43,460
Okay, right here?

928
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,889
Look at that.

929
01:02:50,389 --> 01:02:51,389
Ooh, cigarette.

930
01:02:55,699 --> 01:02:56,699
Okay, if you put it into your mouth,

931
01:02:57,699 --> 01:02:58,940
it just goes right in.

932
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,940
Really important.

933
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:12,280
Anyone have an ashtray?

934
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,909
A control panel, wait.

935
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,119
There?

936
01:03:25,489 --> 01:03:26,489
There's something I can turn on in there, right?

937
01:03:27,489 --> 01:03:28,489
There's something I can turn on over there.

938
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:39,400
Control panel.

939
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,400
I've probably scrambled the circuit,

940
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,440
but considering no one would be dumb enough

941
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,440
to open the hatch,

942
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,090
it shouldn't be too hard to put back.

943
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,090
Okay, wait.

944
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,090
How much debt do I have?

945
01:03:53,389 --> 01:03:56,099
I got full health, I don't need that.

946
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,099
Okay, let's go.

947
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:01,030
Oops, who are you?

948
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:11,000
What's that?

949
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:24,869
Okay, multi-tool.

950
01:04:25,869 --> 01:04:26,869
How much?

951
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:28,869
Oh, okay.

952
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:30,869
I need to put a device in here?

953
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:35,219
Yeah, I need to put a tube in there.

954
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:40,659
How's that?

955
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:51,539
All right, what's that?

956
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:58,380
Does it explode?

957
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:06,119
Is that to put?

958
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:19,860
Where does it want me to go?

959
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:25,389
I don't understand which one it goes in.

960
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,659
How do I tell?

961
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:30,659
Can I tell?

962
01:05:31,659 --> 01:05:38,719
Can I get a thing that tells me?

963
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:43,329
Oh, can I get an emergency thing?

964
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:46,570
Now that I'm walking into the quarantine zone,

965
01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:48,570
it just hit me.

966
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,570
Is that in the game?

967
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,190
Well, actually, the word quarantine

968
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:54,230
means 40 days.

969
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:56,230
Oh, shit.

970
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:58,230
The period that all ships were required to be isolated

971
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:00,230
before crew could go ashore during the Black Death.

972
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,230
That's an amber alert.

973
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:04,230
Let me look at this for a sec.

974
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:14,900
It's not around here.

975
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:16,900
I thought that was in the game.

976
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:20,900
I was like, that's the complete demission sound?

977
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:31,780
Yeah, it's in Utah, apparently.

978
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:37,670
Jesus Christ.

979
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:45,349
Hold on.

980
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:47,349
Actually, I'm going to take this opportunity to pee

981
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:49,349
and this is so fogged up in here.

982
01:06:50,349 --> 01:06:51,349
I've been playing for a fucking hour.

983
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:53,349
It's been like 10 minutes.

984
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,460
Holy shit, I must be having a lot of fun.

985
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,460
All right, let me go get a water

986
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,590
and let me just clean this out.

987
01:07:06,590 --> 01:09:40,779
I'll be right back.

988
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:45,640
Okay, I'm back.

989
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,640
The worst part about VR

990
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,640
is you get so sweaty in this thing

991
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,460
that I almost wish there was a way

992
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,460
to make it so like you didn't bog up

993
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,460
the lenses every 40 minutes.

994
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:04,439
Are you guys counting?

995
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:06,439
Spectator smoothing.

996
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,239
The spectator smoothing is on high.

997
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:22,220
I'm out right now, so

998
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,090
are we good?

999
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,090
Let me just do a check here.

1000
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:37,010
Are we good?

1001
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:40,210
I'm making sure because when I'm in there

1002
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,210
it's kind of hard to, you get in VR

1003
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:46,369
and you can't even tell what's going on.

1004
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,369
How are the subtitles?

1005
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:50,369
Oh, I don't see that on the screen.

1006
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:52,369
That would be awesome if I could see

1007
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:54,369
how much health and breath.

1008
01:10:55,369 --> 01:10:56,369
I'm going to have to ask you guys these things

1009
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:03,390
because I don't even see that shit.

1010
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:06,590
I'm going back in.

1011
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:07,630
Chat is on that hand too,

1012
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,630
so when I see how much health I have

1013
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,630
I see you guys spamming like omega lulz.

1014
01:11:19,659 --> 01:11:20,659
Move it.

1015
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:24,369
No, I can't, it has to be on my left hand.

1016
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:26,369
My right hand is my shooting hand.

1017
01:11:27,369 --> 01:11:28,369
I can't be like in the middle of shooting

1018
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:30,369
and be like, hey guys, hey, hold on a minute.

1019
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:34,210
What are you saying?

1020
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:36,210
No, that's not going to happen.

1021
01:11:37,579 --> 01:11:38,579
That's better.

1022
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:43,250
Better, better, better.

1023
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,550
Oh boy, it's starting to crush my eyes.

1024
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:47,550
All right, let's go.

1025
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:49,550
We're good?

1026
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:51,979
Look at it.

1027
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:58,579
Okay, we're good.

1028
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:10,350
Oh, there it is.

1029
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:21,489
There's the power thing.

1030
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:23,489
I'm sick.

1031
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:25,489
What am I, like 60, 70% of the way through the game?

1032
01:12:26,489 --> 01:12:27,489
Maybe 80% of the way through the game?

1033
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:51,420
It's pretty good so far.

1034
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:57,229
It didn't do anything?

1035
01:12:58,229 --> 01:13:02,029
What's in there?

1036
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:04,899
There's like guts in here.

1037
01:13:05,899 --> 01:13:06,899
Oh, don't, no.

1038
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:08,899
Get him out of there.

1039
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:10,899
Oh no, he's like part of it.

1040
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,840
Part of it.

1041
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:24,060
What the hell?

1042
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,140
How do we get him out of there?

1043
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,300
I can't.

1044
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,380
It's the inception sound.

1045
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:37,380
That's the inception music.

1046
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:42,220
Ha ha.

1047
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,680
Finally.

1048
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,680
You'll go through the old subway tunnels on your way to the train yard.

1049
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,180
Have they started moving down yet?

1050
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,180
I don't think so, which is good news because we've still got time.

1051
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,180
Great.

1052
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,180
Or bad news because they've already killed them

1053
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,420
and you don't need to move a corpse.

1054
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:02,420
You just bury it.

1055
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:06,899
Yeah.

1056
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:09,710
Can that get on me every five minutes?

1057
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:14,000
Get that gun out.

1058
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I feel like it's going to be trouble.

1059
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:37,380
Load it.

1060
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,380
Russell, are you seeing this?

1061
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:41,460
What is this?

1062
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,699
Great.

1063
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:46,279
There we go.

1064
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:53,260
Can I take that?

1065
01:14:54,260 --> 01:15:17,109
It's so annoying.

1066
01:15:18,109 --> 01:15:20,310
I tried to shoot the alien, whatever.

1067
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:27,350
I haven't seen any resin for a little while.

1068
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:37,270
Oh, why not?

1069
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:40,789
Oh, all right.

1070
01:15:41,789 --> 01:15:46,359
Next part of the game.

1071
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:47,399
Resin.

1072
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,239
Been at the same bit for 20 minutes.

1073
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:53,239
I took a break too.

1074
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,310
That's going to explode.

1075
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:58,310
That's going to explode.

1076
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:00,310
That's an explosive barrel.

1077
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,310
It's going to blow up.

1078
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:06,939
It doesn't work every time.

1079
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:12,060
Hey, Russell.

1080
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,060
I just found a loose syringe of God knows what.

1081
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,859
Is this medicine?

1082
01:16:17,859 --> 01:16:19,550
Does it have a skull and cross spines on it?

1083
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:21,550
I don't see one.

1084
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:23,550
Adrenaline should probably be medicine then.

1085
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:29,289
Back in like 2004 when this was ridiculous.

1086
01:16:32,449 --> 01:16:33,449
God, how we've gone so far.

1087
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:39,010
Back in 2004, this was like showing the movie of the train to the people in the 1800s.

1088
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:41,010
They thought they were going to get hit by the fucking train.

1089
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,569
The first movie ever when everyone in the audience was like,

1090
01:16:45,569 --> 01:16:46,569
the train's going to hit us.

1091
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:49,569
That was 2004 with like the first physics based game.

1092
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:55,579
Is there a...

1093
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,460
This is going to explode.

1094
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:00,460
Resin, search.

1095
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,920
Any resin?

1096
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:08,210
No, that's stupid.

1097
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:13,970
The old prospector.

1098
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,010
The old prospector.

1099
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:17,010
Don't go near that one.

1100
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,010
Let me see.

1101
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,010
I've got a lantern here.

1102
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,010
Let's see if I can see where the gold is.

1103
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:25,010
Get that fucking guy away from us.

1104
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:27,010
Don't do that.

1105
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:45,380
Get the old man out of here.

1106
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:50,369
I changed my mind.

1107
01:17:51,369 --> 01:17:53,180
I want it.

1108
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:55,180
Let's take a look and see.

1109
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:58,380
Be careful.

1110
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,060
I heard there were monsters down here.

1111
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:06,130
Oops.

1112
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:08,130
I can't hold it.

1113
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:18,800
Oh, it's one of these guys.

1114
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,800
I heard they will suck on your brain.

1115
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,800
Yeah, that is.

1116
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,579
Eat this, motherfucker.

1117
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:28,579
Oh, it didn't go far enough.

1118
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:31,970
Oh, shit, I missed.

1119
01:18:38,779 --> 01:18:39,779
I could have had him just suck it up.

1120
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:50,659
Clock it, clock it, clock it.

1121
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,720
That seemed to work.

1122
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:22,130
Keep doing that.

1123
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,130
I got it.

1124
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:29,489
Clock it, clock it.

1125
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:31,489
Yeah, clock it.

1126
01:19:38,359 --> 01:19:40,500
Oh, quick.

1127
01:19:40,539 --> 01:19:45,699
Oh, just so you know, the Russells have a built-in display.

1128
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,090
The show might come in handy.

1129
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:51,090
Yeah, I got it.

1130
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:56,079
Thanks.

1131
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:58,380
Check for resin.

1132
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:06,699
I haven't gotten any resin.

1133
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:12,779
I'm terrible.

1134
01:20:18,699 --> 01:20:19,699
Is resin this bad at the game or am I not seeing any?

1135
01:20:22,409 --> 01:20:23,409
What's a gas mask?

1136
01:20:24,409 --> 01:20:27,500
I put it on.

1137
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,500
Holy shit, I didn't even know you could do that.

1138
01:20:30,739 --> 01:20:31,739
I heard a noise.

1139
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:41,090
I heard somebody heard a noise.

1140
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:43,579
Oh, this is a Ghostbusters thing.

1141
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:48,579
Do I actually need that, though?

1142
01:20:49,579 --> 01:21:04,960
Oh, shit, all right, good.

1143
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:10,140
Oh, what's the point of doing that?

1144
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:19,739
Just go like this.

1145
01:21:21,619 --> 01:21:26,510
This is fun.

1146
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:31,500
Can you do it to the skull?

1147
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:38,609
Oh, get the hat.

1148
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:44,609
I don't need a hat.

1149
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,619
I don't need a hat.

1150
01:21:51,909 --> 01:21:52,909
I have nine resins.

1151
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:54,909
Is that good?

1152
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,439
How much ammo is in this?

1153
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:01,939
Can you tell how much bullets?

1154
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:05,390
Wait, does it say that on here?

1155
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:22,220
Look, bud.

1156
01:22:29,609 --> 01:22:34,880
How am I going to let this mean lover try to get over here

1157
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:36,880
and try to shoot me?

1158
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:44,050
I don't work.

1159
01:22:48,170 --> 01:23:06,939
Smash his head.

1160
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:17,439
Back.

1161
01:23:28,659 --> 01:23:29,659
Am I shitting him?

1162
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:47,810
Out of here.

1163
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,989
Lock it in the head.

1164
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:56,819
Do you think I'm aiming for his toes?

1165
01:23:57,819 --> 01:23:58,819
I have 90 ammo.

1166
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:01,060
Are you serious?

1167
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:04,899
Why am I trying so hard to not waste it?

1168
01:24:10,939 --> 01:24:11,939
Ace, what's in it?

1169
01:24:15,609 --> 01:24:17,229
Oh, there's a lock on it?

1170
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:19,229
Of course it's impossible to get into.

1171
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:35,100
It's a Samsonite.

1172
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,430
I'll jump for that guy.

1173
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:40,430
I like to pick him up and pretend to be an alien.

1174
01:24:57,479 --> 01:24:59,869
Oh, shit.

1175
01:25:00,869 --> 01:25:01,869
Oh, man.

1176
01:25:02,869 --> 01:25:03,869
I don't want to do it, man.

1177
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:29,579
I don't want to do it.

1178
01:25:30,579 --> 01:25:31,819
How much ammo is in this?

1179
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:33,819
Six.

1180
01:25:39,989 --> 01:25:40,989
This is fun as fuck.

1181
01:25:41,989 --> 01:25:46,500
What is that?

1182
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:51,100
Is this a coffin?

1183
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,100
Alex, I think that's a combined fabricator.

1184
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,100
Put something in it.

1185
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,100
Will it work on a Russell's?

1186
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,100
No, but it should fix up that pistol nicely.

1187
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,100
Good thing, too.

1188
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,100
I gave you one of my lesser gum.

1189
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,100
Resin?

1190
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,100
Thanks, Russell.

1191
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,100
Resin?

1192
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,100
Oh, resin.

1193
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,100
Come on, it's got to be resin in here somewhere.

1194
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:15,939
Come on, man.

1195
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:21,640
It's got to be resin.

1196
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:27,590
All right, it'll do.

1197
01:26:31,579 --> 01:26:35,319
See?

1198
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:37,560
Wait.

1199
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,560
This is probably resin in this old grandmother's attic box.

1200
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,560
I knew it.

1201
01:26:43,989 --> 01:26:44,989
Any more?

1202
01:26:46,869 --> 01:27:02,130
I can't put the glove on.

1203
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:07,699
Can I open this?

1204
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:09,699
Fun. Very fun.

1205
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:14,819
Wait a minute, over here.

1206
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:21,069
Batteries?

1207
01:27:22,069 --> 01:27:23,890
I'm a resin boy right now.

1208
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:27,340
All right, I think I got it.

1209
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:34,500
Please take the hat off.

1210
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:49,579
There's only the hat?

1211
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:57,779
Get over here.

1212
01:27:58,779 --> 01:27:59,779
Oh, I get it.

1213
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:04,130
You got to have the line go through everything.

1214
01:28:18,939 --> 01:28:19,939
I got it.

1215
01:28:25,399 --> 01:28:27,399
It takes a second to figure out a puzzle.

1216
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:35,270
Oh, man.

1217
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:37,960
Oh, man.

1218
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,960
Oh, man.

1219
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,960
Oh, yeah, this is cool.

1220
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,960
Reflex site?

1221
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:45,960
Or should I hold the laser reflex site?

1222
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:50,439
I might as well.

1223
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:59,960
I always feel like this.

1224
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,960
Whenever you go to a store and they have the iPad that you have to sign and touch,

1225
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:05,960
I'm always like, I don't want to touch this screen, man.

1226
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,329
Reflex sucks.

1227
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:11,659
It's terrible.

1228
01:29:11,699 --> 01:29:13,770
Is it?

1229
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:15,770
Whatever, I'm good.

1230
01:29:24,369 --> 01:29:25,369
How do I insert resin?

1231
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:38,819
Oh, oh, reflex is ass.

1232
01:29:39,819 --> 01:29:40,819
It's all right.

1233
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:44,960
Looks pretty cool.

1234
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:46,960
What are you talking about?

1235
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:52,800
Wait, so that circle is not my crosshair.

1236
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,800
How does that suck?

1237
01:29:58,659 --> 01:29:59,659
That's sick.

1238
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:01,970
Who's this head so much?

1239
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:09,970
I mean, am I moving my head too much?

1240
01:30:14,539 --> 01:30:15,539
Fun guy.

1241
01:30:15,579 --> 01:30:17,520
All right, let's, let's heal.

1242
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:26,029
Oh, I can see the dot.

1243
01:30:27,029 --> 01:30:32,000
Oh, this is actually going to be fucking kind of hard to use.

1244
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I get it now.

1245
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:40,460
I'm hurting them.

1246
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:47,380
All right, I'm good.

1247
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:49,380
I got my reflex site.

1248
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:52,130
I've got my ready to go site.

1249
01:30:53,130 --> 01:31:00,060
But my resin, it's all right.

1250
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:07,229
There's tons of resin in the game.

1251
01:31:09,109 --> 01:31:13,869
Right out.

1252
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:15,869
Oh, my God.

1253
01:31:22,489 --> 01:31:23,489
Lock it.

1254
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:49,460
It actually, I, it doesn't, it's actually kind of good.

1255
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:55,149
Seriously.

1256
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:57,149
It highlights the head.

1257
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:04,750
No.

1258
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:14,479
You guys see what I'm saying, right?

1259
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:16,479
Oh, my God.

1260
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,140
I thought it was going to explode.

1261
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:36,319
Oh, buddy.

1262
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:47,380
Oh, buddy.

1263
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:57,550
Get out of here.

1264
01:32:58,550 --> 01:32:59,550
It's not bad.

1265
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:05,550
What?

1266
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:07,550
I don't know what you could do.

1267
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:11,390
Somebody came in the door.

1268
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:15,229
You can do that.

1269
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,260
All right.

1270
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:23,039
Resident search, thank you.

1271
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,600
What the fuck is this?

1272
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:00,270
Oh, my God.

1273
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:02,270
Resident Evil 4 taught me so well.

1274
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:19,220
I don't have any more.

1275
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:22,159
I got plenty.

1276
01:34:23,159 --> 01:34:24,159
Any complainers?

1277
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:29,470
Any complainers?

1278
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:31,470
Five minutes you play.

1279
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:36,470
Guys, something that you guys have to remember is Resident Evil 4 was the original GTA V.

1280
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:39,819
What I mean by that is they came out with the game.

1281
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:42,819
They've re-released it like eight times.

1282
01:34:43,819 --> 01:34:44,819
This is like before Skyrim did this.

1283
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:46,819
This is before Resident Evil 5.

1284
01:34:47,819 --> 01:34:48,819
I mean before GTA V did this.

1285
01:34:49,819 --> 01:34:50,819
They released it on like 12 different consoles.

1286
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:52,819
I've played through it like four times.

1287
01:34:53,819 --> 01:35:02,649
Why are you talking about releases?

1288
01:35:05,619 --> 01:35:06,619
Somebody just said I've never played.

1289
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:09,619
Somebody said I've played four minutes of Resident Evil 4.

1290
01:35:10,619 --> 01:35:11,619
They don't understand.

1291
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:23,390
What's that?

1292
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:24,430
I see it.

1293
01:35:25,859 --> 01:35:26,859
The what?

1294
01:35:27,859 --> 01:35:49,579
The lamp?

1295
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:52,210
I hear it.

1296
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:54,770
I hear this motherfucker up in that vent.

1297
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:56,770
I heard him in the vent.

1298
01:35:58,779 --> 01:35:59,779
He's in the vent.

1299
01:36:00,779 --> 01:36:01,779
I know he's in the vent.

1300
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:05,170
I know you're in that fucking vent.

1301
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:21,600
I see him.

1302
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:31,710
I hate those things.

1303
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:33,710
Do what he just did.

1304
01:36:37,449 --> 01:36:38,939
Can I ask a question?

1305
01:36:39,939 --> 01:36:42,939
Why do I continue to make Among Us references when I've never played the game?

1306
01:36:43,939 --> 01:36:47,909
I don't even play that game.

1307
01:36:48,909 --> 01:36:49,909
Why do I keep doing that?

1308
01:36:50,909 --> 01:36:51,909
I don't even watch it.

1309
01:36:52,909 --> 01:36:53,909
I don't even care.

1310
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:55,909
I'm never going to play it.

1311
01:36:56,909 --> 01:36:58,979
I don't get it.

1312
01:36:59,979 --> 01:37:00,979
How do I know all this?

1313
01:37:01,979 --> 01:37:02,979
I need to stay relevant.

1314
01:37:03,979 --> 01:37:05,539
I'm not even trying to.

1315
01:37:06,539 --> 01:37:07,539
It's just for some reason.

1316
01:37:08,539 --> 01:37:09,539
I'm just talking about it all the time.

1317
01:37:10,539 --> 01:37:25,689
I talk about Among Us more than I make WoW references at this point.

1318
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:28,439
That's how you know there's a problem.

1319
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:29,479
I don't even watch that fucking game.

1320
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:31,479
You don't even know what I'm talking about.

1321
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:33,479
I know half of you have played WoW.

1322
01:37:44,829 --> 01:37:45,829
Untrue, untrue.

1323
01:37:46,829 --> 01:37:47,829
No, come on.

1324
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,100
Everybody's played WoW at some point in their life.

1325
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:53,100
Even if you got the get to level 10 trial and said,

1326
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,100
this game sucks, I'm never playing it again.

1327
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,100
Get pissed off at your friend that introduced you to it.

1328
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,100
Be like, dude, fuck it.

1329
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:06,300
I'm not playing this stupid game.

1330
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:09,250
Level 20, whatever.

1331
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:11,250
No.

1332
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:13,250
Radio silence since you got on the train.

1333
01:38:13,289 --> 01:38:14,289
Damn.

1334
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:16,289
Well, the good news is he's probably fine.

1335
01:38:17,289 --> 01:38:18,289
How do you know that?

1336
01:38:19,289 --> 01:38:20,289
Because they're taking him to Nova Prospect to toy with him.

1337
01:38:21,289 --> 01:38:22,289
Oh, shit.

1338
01:38:23,289 --> 01:38:24,289
So they're hardly going to toy with him.

1339
01:38:28,789 --> 01:38:40,460
Yo, what's up?

1340
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:42,460
When did I get hit?

1341
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:52,430
That box?

1342
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,720
I didn't think that was going to do anything.

1343
01:39:05,319 --> 01:39:06,319
I need a thing over there.

1344
01:39:13,699 --> 01:39:14,699
Wait, resin.

1345
01:39:15,699 --> 01:39:16,699
I need to make a new indentation on my face.

1346
01:39:17,699 --> 01:39:22,529
There we go.

1347
01:39:22,569 --> 01:39:23,569
Get this shit out of me.

1348
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:31,739
That's in.

1349
01:39:33,689 --> 01:39:36,079
That's in.

1350
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:53,090
That's in.

1351
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:55,520
I have to try this.

1352
01:40:02,199 --> 01:40:07,920
Floppy disk.

1353
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,920
We used to store information on them.

1354
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,500
Specifically, two micrometers of magnetic iron oxide.

1355
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:18,729
Three micrometers.

1356
01:40:19,729 --> 01:40:20,729
How do you know all that?

1357
01:40:21,729 --> 01:40:22,729
I'm reading it here on my computer.

1358
01:40:23,729 --> 01:40:24,729
I downloaded the internet before the war.

1359
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:26,729
You downloaded the entire internet?

1360
01:40:27,729 --> 01:40:28,729
Most of it.

1361
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,770
That's Tim and Eric.

1362
01:40:30,770 --> 01:40:31,770
Got the whole internet on this one CD.

1363
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:33,770
That's one of the best bits.

1364
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:39,770
One of the best skits of any comedy television show is the internet on the CD bit that Tim and Eric did.

1365
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:41,770
That's one of the best.

1366
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:50,600
Ah, there we go.

1367
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,600
Hosted all options.

1368
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:15,859
Heal.

1369
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:39,270
That healer.

1370
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,600
No, it's somewhere.

1371
01:41:56,579 --> 01:41:57,579
What did I do with it?

1372
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:01,859
What?

1373
01:42:02,859 --> 01:42:07,239
What do you mean, what the fuck?

1374
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:09,239
What happened to this?

1375
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:20,310
I got ultra-resident instinct.

1376
01:42:42,989 --> 01:42:43,989
What the hell is that?

1377
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:48,020
Is this electricity or what?

1378
01:42:51,569 --> 01:42:52,569
Can I walk into it?

1379
01:42:53,569 --> 01:42:54,569
Wait a minute, I'm going to throw something in there and see what happens.

1380
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:03,640
Safe.

1381
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:05,640
It's an eye.

1382
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,640
It looks like garbage.

1383
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,840
Right.

1384
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:12,840
It seems harmless.

1385
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:14,840
Can I put my hand in this?

1386
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:27,619
This is why I can't play Luigi's Mansion.

1387
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:30,430
Fuck.

1388
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:31,470
I'm sorry.

1389
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:45,420
Aha, aha, aha.

1390
01:44:02,409 --> 01:44:03,579
Okay.

1391
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:12,609
Resident anywhere else?

1392
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:33,010
Let's go.

1393
01:44:35,659 --> 01:44:36,659
Alright, I made it out.

1394
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:39,600
I have to press the series of buttons.

1395
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:47,329
I'm so glad to be outside.

1396
01:44:48,329 --> 01:44:49,329
Is this like Kinect 4?

1397
01:45:15,699 --> 01:45:18,699
Calling it now, he's going to hit the two correct ones accidentally.

1398
01:45:19,699 --> 01:45:22,609
I don't know what makes them correct.

1399
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:36,939
One of these is the right combo.

1400
01:45:37,939 --> 01:45:46,159
Going anywhere?

1401
01:45:47,659 --> 01:45:48,659
Oh wait, they're over there.

1402
01:45:49,659 --> 01:45:53,729
This is just the thing that's in the doctor's office to keep your child occupied.

1403
01:45:54,729 --> 01:46:03,460
It'll say it right here.

1404
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:13,760
Look, look, look at that.

1405
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:15,760
Would you look at that?

1406
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,699
This tomb is a lot of them.

1407
01:46:19,699 --> 01:46:22,739
Which one is the right one?

1408
01:46:23,739 --> 01:46:26,260
Any of these.

1409
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:42,239
Do I have to try them all?

1410
01:46:43,239 --> 01:46:44,930
Alright, it's that one and that one.

1411
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:50,539
Second row three, fourth row two.

1412
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:53,350
Second row three, fourth row two.

1413
01:46:54,350 --> 01:47:03,529
Try every single one.

1414
01:47:04,529 --> 01:47:05,529
This one.

1415
01:47:05,569 --> 01:47:11,010
Hey, I told you guys I did.

1416
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:21,550
I think this mask in here has been worn down so raw that I'm getting hit with plastic just digging into my face.

1417
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:23,729
I'm going to have to replace it.

1418
01:47:24,729 --> 01:47:28,140
Press it?

1419
01:47:39,369 --> 01:47:40,369
Might be a waste, but I don't care.

1420
01:47:48,649 --> 01:47:51,939
Brick.

1421
01:47:52,939 --> 01:47:56,930
Beginning with a brick, I gotta try.

1422
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:00,699
Who bricks?

1423
01:48:01,699 --> 01:48:06,909
I can make fire on somebody's head.

1424
01:48:07,909 --> 01:48:10,560
Can I crush somebody's head?

1425
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:12,560
Alex, are you alright?

1426
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,600
I'm fine, Russell.

1427
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,600
What's up?

1428
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,180
I'm fine, I'll see you in a minute.

1429
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:23,659
Just get me a large.

1430
01:48:24,659 --> 01:48:25,659
Get me a large steak and cheese.

1431
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:31,300
What did I have to say that for?

1432
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:33,300
Why did I say that?

1433
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:36,430
Now I want a large steak and cheese.

1434
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:38,430
Something so bad right now.

1435
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,430
Why did I do that?

1436
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:42,430
What the fuck is wrong with me?

1437
01:48:57,050 --> 01:48:58,050
That would hurt so much.

1438
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:06,340
I'm ready to pancake somebody's head.

1439
01:49:20,829 --> 01:49:25,460
Alright.

1440
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:28,470
Hello?

1441
01:49:29,470 --> 01:49:37,239
This is weird.

1442
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:44,340
Ring the doorbell?

1443
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:46,340
The Alex Vans.

1444
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:48,340
I said Gorgon, I-

1445
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:52,250
You see?

1446
01:49:54,449 --> 01:49:55,750
Did?

1447
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:57,750
Come, enter.

1448
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:02,359
Okay, thanks.

1449
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:04,359
You are welcome.

1450
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:06,359
So, what's that vortigaunt doing here?

1451
01:50:07,859 --> 01:50:08,859
Cooking.

1452
01:50:09,859 --> 01:50:10,859
Right, but I mean in general.

1453
01:50:11,859 --> 01:50:12,859
Okay.

1454
01:50:12,899 --> 01:50:13,899
I do too.

1455
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:16,649
I'm sorry.

1456
01:50:17,649 --> 01:50:18,649
My brain is injured.

1457
01:50:18,649 --> 01:50:19,649
That's terrible and I hope-

1458
01:50:20,649 --> 01:50:22,949
Look, I'm actually pretty busy looking for my father.

1459
01:50:23,949 --> 01:50:24,949
The-

1460
01:50:25,949 --> 01:50:26,949
Eli Vans.

1461
01:50:27,949 --> 01:50:28,949
Yes.

1462
01:50:29,949 --> 01:50:31,949
The Combine have him and I really do need to get moving.

1463
01:50:32,949 --> 01:50:33,949
The Combine?

1464
01:50:34,949 --> 01:50:35,949
Yes, do not go yet.

1465
01:50:36,949 --> 01:50:37,949
I will show you something.

1466
01:50:38,949 --> 01:50:39,949
Look, I appreciate it.

1467
01:50:40,949 --> 01:50:41,949
This way.

1468
01:50:41,949 --> 01:50:42,949
I can't stick around.

1469
01:50:42,989 --> 01:50:43,989
Is this important?

1470
01:50:44,989 --> 01:50:45,989
I know, I'm sure it is.

1471
01:50:46,989 --> 01:50:48,989
The Alex Vans must go this way.

1472
01:50:49,989 --> 01:50:50,989
This way.

1473
01:50:51,989 --> 01:50:52,989
These guys are so cool.

1474
01:51:03,579 --> 01:51:04,579
I want some.

1475
01:51:05,579 --> 01:51:06,579
Oh, he's the one doing the spells.

1476
01:51:07,579 --> 01:51:10,029
Hold on, wait.

1477
01:51:11,029 --> 01:51:22,619
I'm missing lore.

1478
01:51:23,619 --> 01:51:42,039
The Combine and Alex Vans.

1479
01:51:43,039 --> 01:51:45,619
I would help.

1480
01:51:46,619 --> 01:51:51,619
I really would, but the Alex Vans is honestly very busy saving her dad.

1481
01:51:52,989 --> 01:51:53,989
I will not save him.

1482
01:51:54,989 --> 01:51:55,989
He is dead.

1483
01:51:56,989 --> 01:51:57,989
What?

1484
01:51:57,989 --> 01:51:58,989
Or he will be.

1485
01:51:59,989 --> 01:52:00,989
Is or will be?

1486
01:52:01,989 --> 01:52:02,989
It is a matter of perspective.

1487
01:52:04,489 --> 01:52:07,489
Alex Vans alone cannot prevent his fate.

1488
01:52:08,489 --> 01:52:09,489
I-

1489
01:52:10,489 --> 01:52:14,489
Look, thank you for everything, but I really have to go.

1490
01:52:15,489 --> 01:52:17,489
I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for riddles.

1491
01:52:18,489 --> 01:52:19,489
No riddles.

1492
01:52:20,489 --> 01:52:21,489
The Combine drilled here.

1493
01:52:21,529 --> 01:52:23,529
I am severed from the Vortessence.

1494
01:52:24,529 --> 01:52:26,960
I am alone in my head.

1495
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:30,989
I'm sorry.

1496
01:52:32,229 --> 01:52:34,180
This is your war.

1497
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:38,180
If I can, if I run across your friends, I will see what I can do.

1498
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:41,739
You have saved my kin.

1499
01:52:42,739 --> 01:52:43,739
I haven't.

1500
01:52:44,739 --> 01:52:45,739
Then you will.

1501
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:51,859
Venge Alex Vans.

1502
01:52:52,859 --> 01:52:55,380
Risen!

1503
01:52:58,289 --> 01:52:59,289
Risen, over here.

1504
01:53:00,909 --> 01:53:02,659
Oh no, I got-

1505
01:53:02,699 --> 01:53:03,699
You must go.

1506
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,760
Risen?

1507
01:53:10,510 --> 01:53:12,510
You're baiting people with resin over here.

1508
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:17,060
It's probably right there.

1509
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:18,060
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

1510
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:19,060
I think I see some resin.

1511
01:53:22,859 --> 01:53:23,859
The mission begins.

1512
01:53:24,859 --> 01:53:25,859
They might be-

1513
01:53:26,859 --> 01:53:27,859
Calm down!

1514
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:30,670
He's gonna suck it in the back of the head.

1515
01:53:33,449 --> 01:53:34,449
Whatever, I probably missed the resin.

1516
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:38,220
I'm a fucking maniac.

1517
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:40,220
Just go, Omega Well.

1518
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:43,399
Tell me you didn't get baited from the resin over there.

1519
01:53:44,399 --> 01:53:51,079
Oh, he's the one doing this shit.

1520
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:56,710
Oh!

1521
01:53:57,710 --> 01:53:58,710
I will help you.

1522
01:53:59,710 --> 01:54:01,710
Look to the northern star.

1523
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:03,710
Why?

1524
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:05,710
For guidance.

1525
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:07,710
Okay, thanks.

1526
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:09,710
Are you done helping?

1527
01:54:10,710 --> 01:54:12,270
I am not here.

1528
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:14,960
Sustenance.

1529
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:16,960
I'll eat it later.

1530
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:18,960
Thanks for the help.

1531
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:21,260
You'll be welcome.

1532
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:23,260
Why is that such a big deal?

1533
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:36,000
Eat those.

1534
01:54:36,039 --> 01:54:37,039
They're just protein and shit.

1535
01:54:38,039 --> 01:54:40,560
Why not just eat them?

1536
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:44,060
I don't know, but test it for like, disease?

1537
01:54:45,060 --> 01:55:02,220
Let's go.

1538
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:10,090
Why don't you just eat slugs?

1539
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:20,079
Well, I would eat like slugs and bugs and shit if that was the only source of real food that was still around.

1540
01:55:23,109 --> 01:55:28,109
There's only so many cans of Chef Boyardee, ravioli, mini raviolis that exist.

1541
01:55:28,109 --> 01:55:31,109
Once those are gone, they're gone and then you have to deal with whatever the fuck you have to deal with.

1542
01:55:33,109 --> 01:55:35,060
Is it horrible?

1543
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:39,560
Alex, the signal's back.

1544
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:40,560
Can you hear me?

1545
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:41,560
Are you okay?

1546
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:42,560
Russell, I'm good.

1547
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:43,560
How's Dad?

1548
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:45,560
I've got him on the train.

1549
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:46,560
He's on the move.

1550
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,560
You've got to find Sea View Junction before they get there.

1551
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:50,560
I'm working on it.

1552
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:53,819
Why are these guys going to stand up?

1553
01:55:54,819 --> 01:56:03,100
No, come on.

1554
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:04,100
I can't.

1555
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:05,100
I don't want to say it.

1556
01:56:06,279 --> 01:56:07,279
I don't want to say it.

1557
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:11,520
I found Yellow, the dead body, among us.

1558
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:12,520
Like, I found him.

1559
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:13,520
Who was it, right?

1560
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:14,520
Like, come on.

1561
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:15,560
I'm sorry.

1562
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:16,560
Why?

1563
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,560
I'm sorry.

1564
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:19,800
I'm sorry.

1565
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:20,800
It doesn't even make any sense.

1566
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:21,800
Can I use this?

1567
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:27,180
I'm like...

1568
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:31,529
Oh, it's a hat.

1569
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:38,250
Or the Half-Life door sound.

1570
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:52,649
I'm not going to believe this, but I ran into a building.

1571
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:55,649
It's in the heart.

1572
01:56:55,649 --> 01:56:56,649
In the heart.

1573
01:57:00,649 --> 01:57:01,649
These are the spiky ones.

1574
01:57:01,689 --> 01:57:03,689
That brings me more to that stuff.

1575
01:57:11,329 --> 01:57:17,180
Fuck!

1576
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:32,750
Try to give up.

1577
01:57:38,409 --> 01:57:40,989
Get that off.

1578
01:57:40,989 --> 01:57:41,989
I just don't care.

1579
01:57:41,989 --> 01:57:42,989
I don't care if I miss.

1580
01:57:43,989 --> 01:57:44,989
I don't care if I miss, right?

1581
01:57:44,989 --> 01:57:45,989
Like, I don't care if I miss.

1582
01:57:45,989 --> 01:57:46,989
Stop caring and you'll get it.

1583
01:57:46,989 --> 01:57:47,989
Right?

1584
01:57:47,989 --> 01:57:48,989
No, I don't care.

1585
01:57:48,989 --> 01:57:49,989
I don't care if I miss.

1586
01:57:49,989 --> 01:57:53,659
I don't give a shit if I miss.

1587
01:57:53,659 --> 01:57:54,659
I'm going to go.

1588
01:57:54,659 --> 01:57:55,659
I'm going to keep moving.

1589
01:57:55,659 --> 01:57:56,659
I obviously can't shoot that guy.

1590
01:57:56,659 --> 01:57:57,659
I don't even care if I miss.

1591
01:57:57,659 --> 01:57:58,659
I don't care.

1592
01:57:58,659 --> 01:57:59,659
I don't care if I miss.

1593
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:22,880
Fuck off.

1594
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:23,880
Oh, electricity.

1595
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,890
Oh, electricity.

1596
01:58:26,930 --> 01:58:34,439
What was that?

1597
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:39,500
Oh, it was just his shoes.

1598
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:40,500
Never mind.

1599
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:47,500
What's in here?

1600
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:59,300
Oh, wait a minute.

1601
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,300
Something in the barrel.

1602
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:08,039
What is this?

1603
01:59:08,039 --> 01:59:19,069
What is that?

1604
01:59:20,630 --> 01:59:24,050
Mask on.

1605
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:25,050
Where's the mask?

1606
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:42,670
Where's the mask?

1607
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:47,090
Russell, Russell.

1608
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:48,090
I didn't eat it.

1609
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:50,090
Right.

1610
01:59:50,090 --> 01:59:51,090
Of course you didn't.

1611
01:59:51,090 --> 01:59:54,649
I can check down there, but what is this guy holding?

1612
01:59:54,649 --> 02:00:02,930
Pressing.

1613
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:07,510
Oh, that zombie has a shotgun.

1614
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:08,510
What?

1615
02:00:08,510 --> 02:00:12,310
There's a shotgun in the game?

1616
02:00:13,310 --> 02:00:14,310
All right.

1617
02:00:17,859 --> 02:00:18,859
That's shit.

1618
02:00:18,859 --> 02:00:19,859
That's the only brick I had.

1619
02:00:19,859 --> 02:00:41,060
What do I do now?

1620
02:00:41,060 --> 02:00:42,060
I don't drop him?

1621
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:45,029
N-A-A-M.

1622
02:00:46,029 --> 02:00:54,760
I'm shooting it.

1623
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:59,279
Omega Low, you idiot.

1624
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:08,300
I just like force walk to the ground.

1625
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:12,079
Okay, hold on.

1626
02:01:12,079 --> 02:01:14,729
Okay.

1627
02:01:14,729 --> 02:01:26,460
Oh, it's a pulley system.

1628
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:32,180
Launched.

1629
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:33,180
Oh, all right.

1630
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:36,340
There we go.

1631
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:37,340
You hear that?

1632
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:38,840
Yeah.

1633
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:41,840
Let's get this shotgun and get out of here.

1634
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,020
What's down there?

1635
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:44,020
I don't...

1636
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:45,020
What do you mean you hear that?

1637
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:51,289
What are these?

1638
02:01:52,289 --> 02:01:53,529
What are these?

1639
02:01:53,529 --> 02:01:54,529
I don't know.

1640
02:01:54,529 --> 02:01:55,529
The bullets.

1641
02:01:55,529 --> 02:02:00,220
Give me the...

1642
02:02:00,220 --> 02:02:01,720
Oh, my God.

1643
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:03,720
There's something coming through the door.

1644
02:02:05,470 --> 02:02:06,470
How do I get this shotgun?

1645
02:02:15,539 --> 02:02:16,539
Give me the shotgun, dude.

1646
02:02:18,979 --> 02:02:21,750
Let it go.

1647
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:31,310
Oh, stop.

1648
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:32,310
Where's the thing?

1649
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:40,210
All right.

1650
02:02:40,210 --> 02:02:41,210
Stop it right there.

1651
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:47,329
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me,

1652
02:02:47,329 --> 02:02:48,890
give me, give me, give me.

1653
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:53,390
Oh, yeah.

1654
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:54,390
How do I open shotgun to load shells?

1655
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:55,390
What?

1656
02:02:55,390 --> 02:03:00,859
Oh, shit.

1657
02:03:00,899 --> 02:03:02,899
Oh, shit.

1658
02:03:03,899 --> 02:03:05,899
Click controller to do that.

1659
02:03:05,899 --> 02:03:06,899
Okay.

1660
02:03:06,899 --> 02:03:09,039
I got the shotgun.

1661
02:03:09,039 --> 02:03:10,039
Oh, this...

1662
02:03:10,039 --> 02:03:11,039
What did I just throw?

1663
02:03:14,649 --> 02:03:25,100
Get out of here.

1664
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:27,100
Okay.

1665
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:28,100
Whoa.

1666
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:33,180
We did it.

1667
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:35,130
I lost this gun.

1668
02:03:35,130 --> 02:03:36,130
Last shell.

1669
02:03:36,130 --> 02:03:37,130
I'm out.

1670
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:38,130
Last shell?

1671
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:42,949
Fuck you.

1672
02:03:42,949 --> 02:03:46,050
Any more?

1673
02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:47,050
Bottom of a gamer?

1674
02:03:47,050 --> 02:03:48,050
Really, man?

1675
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:49,420
Maybe?

1676
02:03:49,420 --> 02:04:03,390
I'm basically going to stand up.

1677
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:04,390
I haven't gotten any resin either.

1678
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:05,390
I'm so bad.

1679
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:06,390
Such a bad player.

1680
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:07,390
Stiff gamer.

1681
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:33,060
Yeah, kind of.

1682
02:04:34,060 --> 02:04:35,060
What's over here?

1683
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:49,069
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1684
02:04:49,069 --> 02:04:50,069
There's something over here.

1685
02:04:50,069 --> 02:04:54,260
Oh!

1686
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:56,260
I almost died.

1687
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:59,289
Bottle or something.

1688
02:05:00,289 --> 02:05:07,800
Ow!

1689
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:08,800
Oh!

1690
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:18,659
Hell, yeah.

1691
02:05:18,659 --> 02:05:22,529
The headcrab.

1692
02:05:22,529 --> 02:05:24,979
Can I do that?

1693
02:05:24,979 --> 02:05:25,979
Wait.

1694
02:05:25,979 --> 02:05:28,060
Who wants a drink?

1695
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:31,789
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

1696
02:05:31,789 --> 02:05:32,789
What does that do?

1697
02:05:32,789 --> 02:05:37,619
What does that do for me?

1698
02:05:37,619 --> 02:05:38,619
What did I do that for?

1699
02:05:38,619 --> 02:05:44,850
Look at the liquid of the bottle.

1700
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:45,850
Look at the liquid.

1701
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:56,880
Yeah, that's it.

1702
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:57,880
I'm going to die.

1703
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:02,550
Okay.

1704
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:03,550
Let me ask you a question.

1705
02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:29,779
If you could eat this, if this was completely edible, but it stunk like rotten trash, but

1706
02:06:29,779 --> 02:06:43,829
it was like 25 grams of protein in like all your vitamins, like vitamin C, vitamin B,

1707
02:06:43,829 --> 02:06:46,829
vitamin A, all of them.

1708
02:06:46,829 --> 02:06:49,829
This was like six years worth of food.

1709
02:06:49,829 --> 02:06:56,829
If you eat this, or over here, on that pallet over here, is a stack of food.

1710
02:06:56,829 --> 02:07:04,140
If you eat this, or over here, on that pallet over here, is a stack of a year's worth of

1711
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:06,140
Chef Boyardee mini raviolis.

1712
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:09,699
And this is like stacked up to this height.

1713
02:07:09,699 --> 02:07:10,699
This is at least five years.

1714
02:07:10,699 --> 02:07:11,699
This is one year.

1715
02:07:11,699 --> 02:07:12,699
I would take that one.

1716
02:07:12,699 --> 02:07:18,100
I would take the short thing.

1717
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:19,590
Coming in here.

1718
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:20,590
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1719
02:07:20,590 --> 02:07:40,390
What?

1720
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:41,390
What?

1721
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:49,100
How could there be nothing in a chest?

1722
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:50,100
That's bullshit.

1723
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:51,100
Wait!

1724
02:07:51,100 --> 02:08:20,539
I have a gas mask, right?

1725
02:08:20,539 --> 02:08:21,779
I did.

1726
02:08:21,779 --> 02:08:22,779
Oh shit.

1727
02:08:22,779 --> 02:08:24,220
Okay.

1728
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:29,229
Oh shit.

1729
02:08:29,229 --> 02:08:33,100
Oh shit.

1730
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:34,100
Oh shit.

1731
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:35,100
Oh shit.

1732
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:36,100
Okay.

1733
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:37,100
We're not going to fuck around.

1734
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:38,100
Wipe out!

1735
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:43,939
Wasn't even the right guy!

1736
02:08:43,939 --> 02:08:46,140
Holy shit.

1737
02:08:46,140 --> 02:08:47,140
Okay.

1738
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:50,300
Overkill?

1739
02:08:50,300 --> 02:09:02,680
Was it?

1740
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:03,680
Wait, I need to.

1741
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:07,859
I'm just going to...

1742
02:09:07,859 --> 02:09:13,520
Who holds a shotgun like this?

1743
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:14,520
I need ammo.

1744
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:15,520
Okay.

1745
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:19,039
Okay.

1746
02:09:19,039 --> 02:09:23,350
Overkill?

1747
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:24,350
Was it?

1748
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:26,619
Wait, I need to.

1749
02:09:26,619 --> 02:09:30,100
I'm just going to...

1750
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:31,100
Who holds a shotgun like this?

1751
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:32,100
I need ammo.

1752
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:33,100
Bad, dude.

1753
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:38,430
It's not looking good.

1754
02:09:38,430 --> 02:09:39,430
Oh.

1755
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:40,430
I need a resin.

1756
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:41,430
There's a ladder over there.

1757
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:52,510
Holy shit.

1758
02:09:52,510 --> 02:10:14,420
Did I kill him?

1759
02:10:14,420 --> 02:10:15,420
I almost have full health.

1760
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:21,850
Go there.

1761
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:27,310
These things again.

1762
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:28,310
Okay.

1763
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:43,500
Got it.

1764
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:44,500
Oh, it's an upgrade station.

1765
02:10:49,779 --> 02:10:53,060
Oh.

1766
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:56,539
What the fuck are you doing?

1767
02:10:56,539 --> 02:11:00,920
More resin.

1768
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:01,920
Okay.

1769
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:02,920
That's it.

1770
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:03,920
Yeah, that's the one.

1771
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:05,930
Look for more resin.

1772
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:06,930
Okay.

1773
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:12,579
Okay.

1774
02:11:12,579 --> 02:11:13,949
Okay.

1775
02:11:13,949 --> 02:11:14,949
Okay.

1776
02:11:14,949 --> 02:11:15,949
Okay.

1777
02:11:15,949 --> 02:11:16,949
Okay.

1778
02:11:16,949 --> 02:11:17,949
Okay.

1779
02:11:17,949 --> 02:11:18,949
Okay.

1780
02:11:18,949 --> 02:11:19,949
Okay.

1781
02:11:19,949 --> 02:11:20,949
Okay.

1782
02:11:20,949 --> 02:11:21,949
Okay.

1783
02:11:21,949 --> 02:11:22,949
Okay.

1784
02:11:22,949 --> 02:11:23,949
Okay.

1785
02:11:23,949 --> 02:11:24,949
Okay.

1786
02:11:24,949 --> 02:11:25,949
What the fuck are you doing?

1787
02:11:25,949 --> 02:11:26,949
More resin.

1788
02:11:26,949 --> 02:11:27,949
Okay.

1789
02:11:27,949 --> 02:11:28,949
I'll take an eye out.

1790
02:11:28,949 --> 02:11:29,949
Resin.

1791
02:11:29,949 --> 02:11:30,949
Yeah, that's the one.

1792
02:11:30,949 --> 02:11:31,949
Look for more resin.

1793
02:11:31,949 --> 02:11:32,949
Shit.

1794
02:11:32,949 --> 02:11:33,949
Come on.

1795
02:11:33,949 --> 02:11:36,090
There's got to be some resin.

1796
02:11:36,090 --> 02:11:37,090
Don't I have one of those?

1797
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:38,090
Resin hiding under one of these, I guarantee it.

1798
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:40,989
One of these.

1799
02:11:40,989 --> 02:11:41,989
Oh, yeah.

1800
02:11:41,989 --> 02:11:56,289
Resin, but I'll take the ammo.

1801
02:11:56,289 --> 02:11:57,289
I need it.

1802
02:11:57,289 --> 02:11:58,289
Okay.

1803
02:11:58,289 --> 02:12:02,020
Do I do the side or do I just hold it?

1804
02:12:02,020 --> 02:12:04,479
Do you need a...

1805
02:12:04,479 --> 02:12:05,659
Yes.

1806
02:12:05,659 --> 02:12:06,659
Okay.

1807
02:12:06,659 --> 02:12:08,979
Okay.

1808
02:12:09,979 --> 02:12:10,979
I'll take the ammo.

1809
02:12:10,979 --> 02:12:14,909
I need it.

1810
02:12:14,909 --> 02:12:15,909
Okay.

1811
02:12:15,909 --> 02:12:16,909
Do I do the side or do I just hold it?

1812
02:12:16,909 --> 02:12:17,909
Do you need a...

1813
02:12:17,909 --> 02:12:22,100
Yes, I would eat a headcrab.

1814
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:25,100
If I had to, if I was like life or death, I'm not going to go like, oh, ew, gross, ew,

1815
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:26,720
no, I don't want it.

1816
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:29,720
Like, if I'm going to die, if I'm starving to death, I'm going to eat a headcrab.

1817
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:30,720
Why wouldn't you?

1818
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:31,720
Why are you so against doing that?

1819
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:32,720
Ew, but I don't really need to.

1820
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:33,720
I saved the resin.

1821
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:35,340
I'm not going to use it.

1822
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:37,739
What point?

1823
02:12:37,739 --> 02:12:38,739
The Easter egg.

1824
02:12:38,739 --> 02:12:45,479
I swear to God.

1825
02:12:45,479 --> 02:12:46,479
Okay.

1826
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:58,729
Okay.

1827
02:12:58,729 --> 02:12:59,729
Okay.

1828
02:12:59,729 --> 02:13:01,930
Okay.

1829
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:15,779
Okay.

1830
02:13:15,779 --> 02:13:16,779
Okay.

1831
02:13:16,779 --> 02:13:17,779
I swear to God.

1832
02:13:17,779 --> 02:13:18,779
Okay.

1833
02:13:18,779 --> 02:13:19,779
Where am I?

1834
02:13:19,779 --> 02:13:23,899
I'm somewhere in the house.

1835
02:13:23,899 --> 02:13:24,899
I don't know where I am.

1836
02:13:24,899 --> 02:13:29,140
Where am I?

1837
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:30,140
At the shelf.

1838
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:32,149
Okay.

1839
02:13:32,149 --> 02:13:34,149
That means I should be facing the right way now.

1840
02:13:34,149 --> 02:13:37,250
That's good.

1841
02:13:37,250 --> 02:13:41,939
Crack my fingers.

1842
02:13:41,939 --> 02:13:49,390
Ah, damn it.

1843
02:13:49,390 --> 02:13:56,579
They take three hits each.

1844
02:13:56,579 --> 02:13:57,579
Did I not catch that?

1845
02:13:57,579 --> 02:13:58,579
How?

1846
02:13:58,579 --> 02:14:04,750
I've been catching it all day.

1847
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:05,750
Wait a minute.

1848
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:06,750
Get closer.

1849
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:07,750
I need 25, right?

1850
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:11,619
All right.

1851
02:14:11,619 --> 02:14:15,930
That's good.

1852
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:18,260
Where do I go?

1853
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:27,539
Ban the counters.

1854
02:14:27,539 --> 02:14:28,539
All right.

1855
02:14:28,539 --> 02:14:36,619
Start banning them.

1856
02:14:36,619 --> 02:14:43,109
Start banning the counters.

1857
02:14:43,109 --> 02:14:44,109
They need to get like a five minute timeout.

1858
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:46,310
Start banning those counters.

1859
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:47,310
What did I miss?

1860
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:53,220
Monster.

1861
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:54,220
Fuck.

1862
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:55,720
Here we go.

1863
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:56,720
What about down there?

1864
02:14:56,720 --> 02:14:57,960
Ah!

1865
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:58,960
Go to catch.

1866
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,390
Oh shit.

1867
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:01,390
Here we go.

1868
02:15:01,390 --> 02:15:02,390
You just threw a bullet.

1869
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:03,699
Oh shit.

1870
02:15:03,699 --> 02:15:04,699
Oh shit.

1871
02:15:04,699 --> 02:15:05,699
Oh shit.

1872
02:15:05,699 --> 02:15:13,720
Oh shit.

1873
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:32,500
Oh shit.

1874
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:44,340
Oh shit.

1875
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:45,649
Oh shit.

1876
02:15:45,649 --> 02:15:54,500
Oh shit.

1877
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:56,699
Oh shit.

1878
02:15:56,699 --> 02:16:16,569
Oh shit.

1879
02:16:16,569 --> 02:16:17,569
Oh shit.

1880
02:16:17,569 --> 02:16:21,109
Here we go.

1881
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:29,500
You just threw a bottle at me.

1882
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:49,850
I just whipped a fucking glass bottle in my face.

1883
02:16:49,850 --> 02:16:51,850
I do appreciate this mechanic.

1884
02:16:51,850 --> 02:16:55,850
But like, well, it's actually really, really fun just to do it.

1885
02:16:55,850 --> 02:16:59,049
Works out pretty well.

1886
02:16:59,049 --> 02:17:04,229
Let's see if we can do anything.

1887
02:17:04,229 --> 02:17:08,709
At Krasity Field.

1888
02:17:08,709 --> 02:17:10,270
You're alive.

1889
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:12,270
Oh, he's alive.

1890
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:18,670
That kind of was scary for a second.

1891
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:26,340
Can I go through that?

1892
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:27,340
Doesn't look like it hurts.

1893
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:34,979
Where does this go?

1894
02:17:34,979 --> 02:17:37,430
Okay.

1895
02:17:37,430 --> 02:17:41,489
Off.

1896
02:17:41,489 --> 02:17:54,030
That isn't how this has to go over here.

1897
02:17:54,030 --> 02:17:56,030
Oh, this one's off.

1898
02:17:56,030 --> 02:18:01,790
What the fucking floor?

1899
02:18:01,790 --> 02:18:14,270
Get on.

1900
02:18:14,270 --> 02:18:27,399
Okay.

1901
02:18:27,399 --> 02:18:28,399
Door is locked.

1902
02:18:28,399 --> 02:18:30,399
It's a locked door.

1903
02:18:30,399 --> 02:18:31,399
Curious.

1904
02:18:31,399 --> 02:18:34,409
It's a locked fucking door.

1905
02:18:34,409 --> 02:18:43,370
Don't get this one down.

1906
02:18:43,370 --> 02:18:45,370
Oh, we get the key.

1907
02:18:45,370 --> 02:18:56,020
With both hands.

1908
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:59,879
Beep!

1909
02:18:59,879 --> 02:19:12,100
I knew there was going to be a guy.

1910
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:13,100
Hey!

1911
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:19,079
He's supposed to be dead.

1912
02:19:19,079 --> 02:19:20,079
Show penis.

1913
02:19:20,079 --> 02:19:24,149
That's literally the first thing I see.

1914
02:19:24,149 --> 02:19:27,100
Show penis.

1915
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:29,530
Show your penis.

1916
02:19:29,530 --> 02:19:32,340
No!

1917
02:19:32,340 --> 02:19:35,100
Why even say that?

1918
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:37,100
It's never going to happen.

1919
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:39,100
Why even write it?

1920
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:42,620
It's just never fucking happening.

1921
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:51,319
Show your penis.

1922
02:19:51,319 --> 02:19:53,319
I think that's probably the key.

1923
02:19:53,319 --> 02:19:55,319
Get collapsed on, so let me get this shotgun out.

1924
02:19:55,319 --> 02:19:57,319
Yeah, I'm going to get collapsed on.

1925
02:19:57,319 --> 02:19:59,319
I guarantee it.

1926
02:19:59,319 --> 02:20:01,319
Everything all right?

1927
02:20:01,319 --> 02:20:02,319
One good?

1928
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:03,319
Good.

1929
02:20:03,319 --> 02:20:10,510
Okay.

1930
02:20:10,510 --> 02:20:11,510
Last four.

1931
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:14,260
Two shells left.

1932
02:20:14,260 --> 02:20:15,629
Whoa.

1933
02:20:15,629 --> 02:20:22,079
You got to give me that back.

1934
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:23,829
Okay, I'm ready.

1935
02:20:23,829 --> 02:20:25,829
I'm ready for whatever the fuck is supposed to happen.

1936
02:20:25,829 --> 02:20:28,200
I'm going to pick up the key and there's going to be ten people.

1937
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:33,639
Look at how many shotgun shells.

1938
02:20:33,639 --> 02:20:34,639
Yeah, how they're setting.

1939
02:20:34,639 --> 02:20:38,219
This is like a boss fight.

1940
02:20:38,219 --> 02:20:39,219
That's a lot of ammo.

1941
02:20:39,219 --> 02:20:45,430
Okay, here we go.

1942
02:20:45,430 --> 02:20:54,899
Flashlight and gravity glove.

1943
02:20:54,899 --> 02:21:13,209
Oh, thank God.

1944
02:21:13,209 --> 02:21:15,209
Oh, shoot.

1945
02:21:15,209 --> 02:21:16,639
Okay, I'm ready.

1946
02:21:16,639 --> 02:21:19,899
Oh, no.

1947
02:21:19,899 --> 02:21:20,899
No, this became another game.

1948
02:21:20,899 --> 02:21:21,899
Oh, boy.

1949
02:21:21,899 --> 02:21:22,899
Here we go.

1950
02:21:22,899 --> 02:21:39,120
I can see them.

1951
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:41,120
I can see them.

1952
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:54,530
Ah.

1953
02:21:54,530 --> 02:21:55,530
Okay, close it up, please.

1954
02:21:55,530 --> 02:21:56,530
Thank you.

1955
02:21:56,530 --> 02:22:10,180
This is fine.

1956
02:22:10,180 --> 02:22:11,680
It's fine.

1957
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:16,309
I hate this.

1958
02:22:16,309 --> 02:22:17,309
I hate this.

1959
02:22:17,309 --> 02:22:18,309
I hate this.

1960
02:22:18,309 --> 02:22:19,309
Yeah?

1961
02:22:19,309 --> 02:22:21,309
Can you just talk?

1962
02:22:21,309 --> 02:22:22,309
About what?

1963
02:22:22,309 --> 02:22:23,309
About anything.

1964
02:22:23,309 --> 02:22:24,309
Literally anything.

1965
02:22:24,309 --> 02:22:25,309
Oh.

1966
02:22:25,309 --> 02:22:26,309
Oh, this hand.

1967
02:22:26,309 --> 02:22:27,309
Oh, yeah.

1968
02:22:27,309 --> 02:22:28,309
So, when you're in a situation

1969
02:22:28,309 --> 02:22:30,309
your irrational fear of the dark is actually quite appropriate.

1970
02:22:30,309 --> 02:22:32,309
You know, I can give you easily a hundred reasons to be terrified.

1971
02:22:32,309 --> 02:22:35,309
Okay, that was my fault.

1972
02:22:35,309 --> 02:22:36,309
I'll be more specific next time.

1973
02:22:36,309 --> 02:22:38,309
Everybody boo.

1974
02:22:38,309 --> 02:22:41,129
Love it after we get real funny glass break joke.

1975
02:22:41,129 --> 02:22:43,129
I still got it.

1976
02:22:43,129 --> 02:22:51,639
Big fan of this flashlight.

1977
02:22:51,639 --> 02:22:54,639
And it's not unlike yourself is also sensitive to the dark.

1978
02:22:54,639 --> 02:22:55,639
Oh, yeah?

1979
02:22:55,639 --> 02:22:58,639
Meaning it should go on automatically when the lights go out.

1980
02:22:58,639 --> 02:23:00,639
Oh, how do I turn it off when the lights are on?

1981
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:01,639
Yes.

1982
02:23:01,639 --> 02:23:06,700
How do I turn it off?

1983
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:13,420
What am I swapping out here for?

1984
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:14,909
I thought I was pooping.

1985
02:23:14,909 --> 02:23:15,909
Oiling yourself.

1986
02:23:15,909 --> 02:23:18,819
Yup.

1987
02:23:18,819 --> 02:23:23,129
Off.

1988
02:23:23,129 --> 02:23:24,129
What is going on?

1989
02:23:24,129 --> 02:23:29,399
Dude.

1990
02:23:29,399 --> 02:23:31,399
I just didn't know.

1991
02:23:31,399 --> 02:23:36,860
Aha.

1992
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:39,680
It resonated behind me.

1993
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:41,299
Hot gun shells.

1994
02:23:41,299 --> 02:23:42,540
No.

1995
02:23:42,540 --> 02:23:43,540
Well, fell on the ground.

1996
02:23:43,540 --> 02:23:50,200
Okay, does it matter what shoulder?

1997
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:53,809
Like I keep messing that up somehow.

1998
02:23:53,809 --> 02:24:04,469
Back up to the electricity thing.

1999
02:24:04,469 --> 02:24:07,799
That's the door that was locked.

2000
02:24:07,799 --> 02:24:10,379
Did I get a key or anything?

2001
02:24:10,379 --> 02:24:30,290
I got a flashlight.

2002
02:24:30,290 --> 02:25:04,079
Is it making him uncomfortable?

2003
02:25:04,079 --> 02:25:06,700
I mean, ignoring them?

2004
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:12,329
Well, yeah, I'm trying to pick through, like, look at his dick comments to see if anybody has an answer.

2005
02:25:12,329 --> 02:25:25,409
Okay.

2006
02:25:25,409 --> 02:25:27,030
Going back out.

2007
02:25:27,030 --> 02:25:36,659
Wrong way.

2008
02:25:36,659 --> 02:25:42,739
Back in the dark tunnel?

2009
02:25:42,739 --> 02:25:54,319
Oh, no, no, no.

2010
02:25:54,319 --> 02:25:58,739
I was going the wrong way?

2011
02:25:58,739 --> 02:25:59,739
Wrong way.

2012
02:25:59,739 --> 02:26:00,739
You fucking idiot.

2013
02:26:00,739 --> 02:26:02,680
Oh, please.

2014
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:04,680
Nobody mentioned your dick.

2015
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:06,680
It's all anybody's saying.

2016
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:09,680
It's like the only thing being said.

2017
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:17,860
Am I going the right way?

2018
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:22,079
I'm going the right way, right?

2019
02:26:22,079 --> 02:26:33,729
No, the taser's not going to work.

2020
02:26:33,729 --> 02:26:34,729
Yeah, I'm going the right way.

2021
02:26:34,729 --> 02:26:48,549
I got jumpscared.

2022
02:26:51,049 --> 02:26:59,780
Hey.

2023
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:02,780
No, no, no.

2024
02:27:02,780 --> 02:27:05,370
You're fine.

2025
02:27:05,370 --> 02:27:07,370
Get it off your face, Alex.

2026
02:27:07,370 --> 02:27:09,309
Get it off my face.

2027
02:27:09,309 --> 02:27:24,889
I'm fine.

2028
02:27:24,889 --> 02:27:25,889
I'm fine.

2029
02:27:25,889 --> 02:27:26,889
I'm fine.

2030
02:27:26,889 --> 02:27:29,090
I'm fine.

2031
02:27:29,090 --> 02:27:30,090
I got two hearts.

2032
02:27:30,090 --> 02:27:32,100
I'm good.

2033
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:41,629
I don't even think about it, you little shit.

2034
02:27:41,629 --> 02:27:43,629
That's where I got to go, but wait.

2035
02:27:43,629 --> 02:27:44,629
Ammo.

2036
02:27:44,629 --> 02:27:49,069
Both?

2037
02:27:49,069 --> 02:27:51,500
Let me just check.

2038
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:55,600
That's why you check.

2039
02:27:55,600 --> 02:28:08,340
Why you check.

2040
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:11,819
Guys.

2041
02:28:11,819 --> 02:28:12,819
You want an ammo?

2042
02:28:12,819 --> 02:28:13,819
830?

2043
02:28:13,819 --> 02:28:18,770
I got enough.

2044
02:28:18,770 --> 02:28:19,770
All right, rest.

2045
02:28:19,770 --> 02:28:21,770
Oh, yeah.

2046
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:22,770
Absolutely.

2047
02:28:22,770 --> 02:28:25,420
Before.

2048
02:28:25,420 --> 02:28:27,420
What was life like before the combine?

2049
02:28:27,420 --> 02:28:28,420
Ah, excellent.

2050
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:32,059
Have a club sandwich.

2051
02:28:32,059 --> 02:28:33,059
Uh, nope.

2052
02:28:33,059 --> 02:28:34,059
Not once.

2053
02:28:34,059 --> 02:28:35,059
Right.

2054
02:28:35,059 --> 02:28:37,059
To make a club sandwich, you need to start with bread.

2055
02:28:37,059 --> 02:28:38,059
Not from a bread line.

2056
02:28:38,059 --> 02:28:40,059
From a bakery across the street.

2057
02:28:40,059 --> 02:28:42,059
I actually would rather you talk about something else completely.

2058
02:28:42,059 --> 02:28:44,059
You had tomatoes, lettuce.

2059
02:28:44,059 --> 02:28:48,059
We've been eating fucking soup out of a can in the last five years.

2060
02:28:48,059 --> 02:28:49,059
I don't want to hear about this.

2061
02:28:49,059 --> 02:28:50,059
Tell me about something else.

2062
02:28:50,059 --> 02:28:51,059
You toast the bread.

2063
02:28:51,059 --> 02:28:52,059
And you put all that in.

2064
02:28:52,059 --> 02:28:53,059
You're making me want to turn the stream off.

2065
02:28:53,059 --> 02:28:54,059
You guys have all that.

2066
02:28:54,059 --> 02:28:55,059
I want one of those now.

2067
02:28:55,059 --> 02:28:56,059
That's insane.

2068
02:28:56,059 --> 02:28:57,059
It is.

2069
02:28:57,059 --> 02:29:01,219
And I'm not on top of the first one.

2070
02:29:01,219 --> 02:29:02,219
You put ham in it.

2071
02:29:02,219 --> 02:29:03,219
Also from a pig.

2072
02:29:03,219 --> 02:29:05,219
And turkey from an animal we used to call.

2073
02:29:05,219 --> 02:29:06,219
Back up.

2074
02:29:06,219 --> 02:29:07,219
Back the fuck up.

2075
02:29:07,219 --> 02:29:08,219
And more tomato.

2076
02:29:08,219 --> 02:29:09,219
I can't back up.

2077
02:29:09,219 --> 02:29:11,219
And one of the other things I'm forgetting.

2078
02:29:11,219 --> 02:29:16,020
It was six inches tall and weighed up to continents.

2079
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:19,020
It was the most impossible food item you could imagine.

2080
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:21,020
In any age before ours.

2081
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:22,649
Shit.

2082
02:29:22,649 --> 02:29:23,649
Wow.

2083
02:29:23,649 --> 02:29:24,649
I know, right?

2084
02:29:24,649 --> 02:29:25,649
That is.

2085
02:29:25,649 --> 02:29:26,649
Wow.

2086
02:29:26,649 --> 02:29:27,649
Okay.

2087
02:29:27,649 --> 02:29:28,649
Okay.

2088
02:29:28,649 --> 02:29:29,649
Thanks, man.

2089
02:29:29,649 --> 02:29:30,649
You're welcome, Alex.

2090
02:29:30,649 --> 02:29:32,459
In.

2091
02:29:32,459 --> 02:29:38,180
Thank you.

2092
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:49,469
Else.

2093
02:29:49,469 --> 02:29:50,469
We're good.

2094
02:29:50,469 --> 02:29:51,969
After that fucking thing.

2095
02:29:51,969 --> 02:29:52,969
Okay.

2096
02:29:52,969 --> 02:29:54,719
This is going to be weird.

2097
02:29:54,719 --> 02:29:55,719
I need to pull this out.

2098
02:29:55,719 --> 02:29:56,719
Hey, get over there, dude.

2099
02:29:56,719 --> 02:30:07,819
Just get over there.

2100
02:30:07,819 --> 02:30:08,819
Get this over there.

2101
02:30:08,819 --> 02:30:09,819
What happened?

2102
02:30:09,819 --> 02:30:12,020
What did I just do?

2103
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:13,020
What did I just do?

2104
02:30:13,020 --> 02:30:14,700
It's too dark.

2105
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:19,979
Where's the thing?

2106
02:30:19,979 --> 02:30:20,979
What happened to the healing thing?

2107
02:30:20,979 --> 02:30:21,979
Where did it go?

2108
02:30:21,979 --> 02:30:22,979
Oh.

2109
02:30:22,979 --> 02:30:26,520
It's a.

2110
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:32,819
It's a box down.

2111
02:30:32,819 --> 02:30:33,819
Give me it.

2112
02:30:33,819 --> 02:30:38,829
Watch out.

2113
02:30:38,829 --> 02:30:40,069
Watch out.

2114
02:30:40,069 --> 02:30:41,069
He's going to get you.

2115
02:30:41,069 --> 02:30:42,069
Back up.

2116
02:30:42,069 --> 02:30:44,590
Back up.

2117
02:30:44,590 --> 02:30:45,590
Do it.

2118
02:30:45,590 --> 02:30:54,899
Do it.

2119
02:30:54,899 --> 02:30:55,899
Do it.

2120
02:30:55,899 --> 02:30:59,309
Do it.

2121
02:30:59,309 --> 02:31:09,260
Do it.

2122
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:10,260
Do it.

2123
02:31:10,260 --> 02:31:12,709
Do it.

2124
02:31:12,709 --> 02:31:15,870
Do it.

2125
02:31:15,870 --> 02:31:16,870
Do it.

2126
02:31:16,870 --> 02:31:17,870
Do it.

2127
02:31:17,870 --> 02:31:18,870
Do it.

2128
02:31:18,870 --> 02:31:22,860
Do it.

2129
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:29,610
Get out of there.

2130
02:31:29,610 --> 02:31:30,610
Get out of there.

2131
02:31:30,610 --> 02:31:36,069
Go.

2132
02:31:36,069 --> 02:31:37,069
Get out of here.

2133
02:31:37,069 --> 02:31:38,069
Get out of here.

2134
02:31:38,069 --> 02:31:44,559
Get out of here.

2135
02:31:44,559 --> 02:31:45,559
Get out of here.

2136
02:31:45,559 --> 02:31:48,719
Go.

2137
02:31:48,719 --> 02:31:59,049
Go.

2138
02:31:59,049 --> 02:32:00,049
Go.

2139
02:32:00,049 --> 02:32:02,700
Go.

2140
02:32:02,700 --> 02:32:03,700
Go.

2141
02:32:03,700 --> 02:32:05,450
Oh my God.

2142
02:32:05,450 --> 02:32:06,450
Oh my God.

2143
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:07,879
Oh my God.

2144
02:32:07,879 --> 02:32:10,979
Oh my God.

2145
02:32:10,979 --> 02:32:14,329
Oh my God.

2146
02:32:14,329 --> 02:32:15,329
What is he?

2147
02:32:15,329 --> 02:32:16,329
He's inside of my desk.

2148
02:32:16,329 --> 02:32:23,139
Sicken.

2149
02:32:23,139 --> 02:32:28,979
He's in a sicken.

2150
02:32:28,979 --> 02:32:29,979
Where's the.

2151
02:32:29,979 --> 02:32:33,139
Exploder.

2152
02:32:33,139 --> 02:32:34,139
Holy shit.

2153
02:32:34,139 --> 02:32:35,139
Is he dead?

2154
02:32:35,139 --> 02:32:36,139
Let me do that.

2155
02:32:36,139 --> 02:32:40,459
I ain't even scared as shit.

2156
02:32:40,459 --> 02:32:41,459
Wilhelm scream?

2157
02:32:41,459 --> 02:32:46,319
That was not a Wilhelm scream.

2158
02:32:46,319 --> 02:32:50,329
What was it?

2159
02:32:50,329 --> 02:32:51,889
I did the Wilhelm scream?

2160
02:32:51,889 --> 02:32:54,979
Get off of me.

2161
02:32:54,979 --> 02:32:55,979
Get off of me.

2162
02:32:55,979 --> 02:33:00,229
It was?

2163
02:33:00,229 --> 02:33:04,739
Maybe.

2164
02:33:04,739 --> 02:33:06,940
Nerve-racking, man.

2165
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:07,940
This is scary shit.

2166
02:33:07,940 --> 02:33:08,940
I thought this was an ammo.

2167
02:33:08,940 --> 02:33:15,420
Really?

2168
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:16,420
Uh-huh.

2169
02:33:16,420 --> 02:33:17,420
One thing I don't...

2170
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:27,500
Why?

2171
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:42,100
I have to scratch the very part of my back that I cannot reach to put that in my backpack.

2172
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:55,940
What does it even do?

2173
02:33:55,940 --> 02:33:59,399
I only have one of these?

2174
02:34:00,819 --> 02:34:01,819
Oh, shit.

2175
02:34:01,819 --> 02:34:04,219
I can only hold one.

2176
02:34:04,219 --> 02:34:05,219
Can I hold it in the other hand?

2177
02:34:05,219 --> 02:34:06,899
We're good.

2178
02:34:06,899 --> 02:34:13,459
Here it is.

2179
02:34:13,459 --> 02:34:22,569
Fuck.

2180
02:34:22,569 --> 02:34:26,700
Ah, there's another one of these rooms with a bunch of shit in it.

2181
02:34:26,700 --> 02:34:36,469
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2182
02:34:36,469 --> 02:34:37,469
Okay.

2183
02:34:37,469 --> 02:34:44,149
I'll take a shotgun, please.

2184
02:34:44,149 --> 02:34:45,149
Okay.

2185
02:34:45,149 --> 02:34:46,709
Okay.

2186
02:34:46,709 --> 02:34:51,979
Okay.

2187
02:34:51,979 --> 02:34:53,610
Okay.

2188
02:34:53,610 --> 02:35:38,110
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2189
02:35:38,110 --> 02:35:43,110
This is how I got here, you son of a bitch.

2190
02:35:43,110 --> 02:35:52,030
There's...

2191
02:35:52,190 --> 02:36:00,879
Everybody's running!

2192
02:36:00,879 --> 02:36:06,739
This is true terror.

2193
02:36:06,739 --> 02:36:07,739
Okay.

2194
02:36:07,739 --> 02:36:13,219
ER is too much, man.

2195
02:36:13,219 --> 02:36:17,040
No, no, no, it's too much.

2196
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:24,569
Okay, I've like been bumping into walls and screaming.

2197
02:36:24,569 --> 02:36:27,809
They're shooting at me, smash!

2198
02:36:27,809 --> 02:36:29,809
Oh my God, boom!

2199
02:36:29,809 --> 02:36:33,809
If you're like a neighbor, I'm being attacked in here.

2200
02:36:33,809 --> 02:36:37,299
Like, I'm being physically fucking assaulted in here.

2201
02:36:37,299 --> 02:36:39,799
There's a fight going on in here.

2202
02:36:39,959 --> 02:36:47,870
Especially if you have this playing through speakers, too.

2203
02:36:47,870 --> 02:36:51,049
Like, let's say there's like two or three buddies in the room and like you're hearing

2204
02:36:51,049 --> 02:36:54,049
like glass breaking and like explosions and stuff.

2205
02:36:54,049 --> 02:36:57,049
Wouldn't you be like, holy shit, what the fuck is happening over there?

2206
02:36:57,049 --> 02:37:00,459
Oh shoot, this?

2207
02:37:00,459 --> 02:37:01,459
What the fuck am I doing?

2208
02:37:01,459 --> 02:37:02,459
I'm gonna take this...

2209
02:37:02,459 --> 02:37:13,129
Let's check for resin, now that we can calm down.

2210
02:37:13,129 --> 02:37:22,620
I don't see anything.

2211
02:37:22,620 --> 02:37:25,620
I'm not gonna freak out this time.

2212
02:37:25,620 --> 02:37:33,149
They've given it to me for a reason.

2213
02:37:33,149 --> 02:37:54,639
Okay, what's that?

2214
02:37:54,639 --> 02:37:55,639
What's this?

2215
02:37:55,639 --> 02:37:56,639
Relax song?

2216
02:37:56,799 --> 02:37:57,799
Oh my God!

2217
02:37:57,799 --> 02:38:00,379
Run, run, run!

2218
02:38:00,379 --> 02:38:01,379
It was the same energy.

2219
02:38:01,379 --> 02:38:08,489
Give me this thing!

2220
02:38:08,489 --> 02:38:36,739
Oh shit, chapter complete!

2221
02:38:36,739 --> 02:38:53,610
Sucks but the video is kind of cool.

2222
02:38:53,610 --> 02:39:03,100
True?

2223
02:39:03,100 --> 02:39:07,540
I haven't heard that song in a very very long time.

2224
02:39:07,540 --> 02:39:11,020
What do we got?

2225
02:39:11,020 --> 02:39:12,899
What do we got?

2226
02:39:12,899 --> 02:39:13,899
I was just looking for resin.

2227
02:39:13,899 --> 02:39:20,540
When you're looking for it, you got it.

2228
02:39:20,540 --> 02:39:26,129
Okay, bad?

2229
02:39:26,129 --> 02:39:27,129
Breakable blocks?

2230
02:39:27,129 --> 02:39:28,129
Resin in here?

2231
02:39:28,129 --> 02:39:32,969
I know me, aren't you?

2232
02:39:32,969 --> 02:39:35,940
Flashlight?

2233
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:39,579
Wait, is that a dead combine soldier?

2234
02:39:39,579 --> 02:39:45,219
Yeah, that is a dead combine soldier.

2235
02:39:45,219 --> 02:39:47,219
When you guys were off to do the reactor, I saw the combine leaving some ties in here.

2236
02:39:47,219 --> 02:39:49,219
So, I guess they're interested in this place again.

2237
02:39:49,219 --> 02:39:51,219
Right, well keep an eye out. Something's definitely up.

2238
02:39:51,219 --> 02:39:53,219
I didn't want him to get up.

2239
02:39:53,219 --> 02:39:55,219
I didn't want him to get up. He's a fucking bad guy.

2240
02:39:55,219 --> 02:39:57,219
What the hell is that?

2241
02:39:57,219 --> 02:40:02,719
Oh my god, what did I do about it?

2242
02:40:02,719 --> 02:40:11,360
Oh my god, it's a dead combine soldier.

2243
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:13,360
I didn't want him to get up.

2244
02:40:13,360 --> 02:40:27,440
I didn't want him to get up.

2245
02:40:27,440 --> 02:40:30,260
I didn't want him to get up.

2246
02:40:30,260 --> 02:40:32,260
I didn't want him to get up.

2247
02:40:32,260 --> 02:40:34,260
Oh my god, it's a big...

2248
02:40:37,649 --> 02:40:43,280
I'm gonna fly your drone inside in the hallway.

2249
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:52,500
I hear a little...

2250
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:55,629
I hear a guy.

2251
02:40:55,629 --> 02:41:13,940
I hear a...

2252
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:18,219
You guys hear it, right?

2253
02:41:18,219 --> 02:41:20,219
You can always tell when a combine's around because they sound kind of like a pig relaxing.

2254
02:41:20,219 --> 02:41:40,450
Okay, so...

2255
02:41:40,450 --> 02:41:42,450
Right now, what it's like to live on Earth on a scale of one to ten.

2256
02:41:42,450 --> 02:41:44,450
What it's like to live on Earth on a scale of one to ten.

2257
02:41:44,450 --> 02:41:46,450
What it's like to live on Earth on a scale of one to ten.

2258
02:41:46,450 --> 02:41:50,350
I'd say right at two.

2259
02:41:50,350 --> 02:41:52,350
What would you rate it before the combine showed up?

2260
02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:54,350
Ooh, that's a toughie. I don't know.

2261
02:41:54,350 --> 02:41:56,350
What the fuck was that?

2262
02:41:56,350 --> 02:41:58,350
Good day, I'd say six.

2263
02:41:58,350 --> 02:42:00,350
Do I have any healing?

2264
02:42:00,350 --> 02:42:02,350
Six? That's not great.

2265
02:42:02,350 --> 02:42:04,350
Well, that's life, Alex. You know, it's not always great.

2266
02:42:04,350 --> 02:42:06,350
Well, maybe we get the combine offer.

2267
02:42:06,350 --> 02:42:08,350
Oh, here we go.

2268
02:42:08,350 --> 02:42:10,350
Get up.

2269
02:42:10,350 --> 02:42:12,350
Ooh, an eight. Yeah, that really would be nice.

2270
02:42:12,350 --> 02:42:14,350
I'm gonna go yellow to yellow.

2271
02:42:14,350 --> 02:42:19,409
I don't...

2272
02:42:19,409 --> 02:42:24,590
I just have to remember where they are.

2273
02:42:24,590 --> 02:42:26,590
This is green. Green to green.

2274
02:42:26,590 --> 02:42:29,409
Red.

2275
02:42:29,409 --> 02:42:37,979
Okay, red to red.

2276
02:42:37,979 --> 02:42:44,370
Over here. Nope.

2277
02:42:44,370 --> 02:42:46,370
I don't know. Purple. Green. No.

2278
02:42:46,370 --> 02:42:52,260
There's just green over here.

2279
02:42:52,260 --> 02:43:06,829
You know, purple.

2280
02:43:06,829 --> 02:43:09,649
Invisual lockers.

2281
02:43:09,649 --> 02:43:14,700
Probably going to be a thing. Yes, there is.

2282
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:16,700
Something is stomping around upstairs.

2283
02:43:16,700 --> 02:43:18,700
I seriously don't know what it is.

2284
02:43:18,700 --> 02:43:29,389
Resid.

2285
02:43:29,389 --> 02:43:35,200
That thing.

2286
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:54,129
How do I use this? Empty?

2287
02:43:54,129 --> 02:44:01,739
That's it. There's the guy making the noise.

2288
02:44:01,739 --> 02:44:13,200
Hear that shit?

2289
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:16,020
Fucking chest. Box.

2290
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:18,319
Fucking box.

2291
02:44:18,319 --> 02:44:20,319
Fucking box. Hold on.

2292
02:44:20,319 --> 02:44:25,309
Yeah, guess what?

2293
02:44:25,309 --> 02:44:27,309
There ain't gonna be shit in here.

2294
02:44:27,309 --> 02:44:29,309
It's gonna be empty. Ready?

2295
02:44:29,309 --> 02:44:31,309
Okay, if this chest is empty,

2296
02:44:31,309 --> 02:44:33,309
I get 100 subs.

2297
02:44:33,309 --> 02:44:36,190
If this chest is full of stuff,

2298
02:44:36,190 --> 02:44:38,190
I'm gonna shout out your name. That's right, you.

2299
02:44:38,190 --> 02:44:40,190
I'm gonna shout your name out in the chat room.

2300
02:44:40,190 --> 02:44:50,500
My fucking arm.

2301
02:44:50,500 --> 02:44:55,360
That really hurt.

2302
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:57,360
Really, really hurt.

2303
02:44:57,360 --> 02:45:03,760
I look like I'm bleeding, am I?

2304
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:07,409
Okay.

2305
02:45:07,409 --> 02:45:10,290
It's full of stuff.

2306
02:45:10,290 --> 02:45:12,290
Sawdust bunnies. Got a shout out for you.

2307
02:45:12,290 --> 02:45:14,979
Hey, Russian space fruit.

2308
02:45:14,979 --> 02:45:16,979
Got a shout out for you too.

2309
02:45:16,979 --> 02:45:21,069
Hey, Funder Dunder.

2310
02:45:21,069 --> 02:45:23,069
I'm talking to you.

2311
02:45:23,069 --> 02:45:25,760
You and me. We're friends.

2312
02:45:25,760 --> 02:45:27,760
Hey, the My SQ. You and me.

2313
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:31,340
We're best friends.

2314
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:33,340
Don't shout me out. James. W.

2315
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:36,290
Hey, the train doctor.

2316
02:45:36,290 --> 02:45:39,489
Alright, very close.

2317
02:45:39,489 --> 02:45:42,180
Hey, Les Manda.

2318
02:45:42,180 --> 02:45:44,930
Hey,

2319
02:45:44,930 --> 02:45:50,559
I'm talking to you.

2320
02:45:50,559 --> 02:45:52,559
Hey, Ecalb99.

2321
02:45:52,559 --> 02:45:56,459
Suck.

2322
02:45:56,459 --> 02:45:58,459
Alright, that's enough.

2323
02:45:58,459 --> 02:46:07,260
What is this? Television?

2324
02:46:07,260 --> 02:46:11,549
What about me? Hey, Yellow.

2325
02:46:11,549 --> 02:46:13,549
Me, me, me. Okay, one more.

2326
02:46:13,549 --> 02:46:16,110
Lemon, the lemon guy.

2327
02:46:16,110 --> 02:46:18,799
Alright, we'll do five more.

2328
02:46:18,799 --> 02:46:21,040
Hey, Jabe. Hey, Goat Boy.

2329
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:23,040
Hey, Navy Bog.

2330
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:25,040
Hey,

2331
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:27,790
Daisy Day.

2332
02:46:27,790 --> 02:46:31,120
Hey, Believe Blood.

2333
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:33,120
Hey, Axolotl Inferno.

2334
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:36,770
I'm talking about you.

2335
02:46:36,770 --> 02:46:38,770
Hey, Squeezy Chips.

2336
02:46:38,770 --> 02:46:42,290
I'm done doing this.

2337
02:46:42,290 --> 02:46:44,290
This joke was over 15 seconds ago.

2338
02:46:44,290 --> 02:46:47,229
I'm gonna fucking

2339
02:46:47,229 --> 02:46:52,930
smash the computer.

2340
02:46:52,930 --> 02:46:56,829
Alright, let's head down here.

2341
02:46:56,829 --> 02:47:03,340
Oh, shit.

2342
02:47:03,340 --> 02:47:05,340
Hey.

2343
02:47:05,340 --> 02:47:07,340
Oh, shit.

2344
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:10,799
Okay, he's dead.

2345
02:47:10,799 --> 02:47:31,200
He has a backpack?

2346
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:39,899
He's gonna, I know

2347
02:47:39,899 --> 02:47:41,899
when he's gonna be alive. He's gonna be this one.

2348
02:47:41,899 --> 02:47:53,739
Alright, this, we're gonna go this way.

2349
02:47:53,739 --> 02:48:00,319
Oh, sub.

2350
02:48:00,319 --> 02:48:04,100
Wait, Vinny got a sub. Vinny got

2351
02:48:04,100 --> 02:48:08,959
a vinesauce sub.

2352
02:48:08,959 --> 02:48:10,959
Well, follow Vinny. I'm talking to you directly. Go follow Vinny

2353
02:48:10,959 --> 02:48:12,959
if you have any. He's fucking one of the best streamers on Twitch.

2354
02:48:12,959 --> 02:48:14,959
Vinesauce, go do it.

2355
02:48:14,959 --> 02:48:18,030
If at least half of you don't go follow Vinny

2356
02:48:18,030 --> 02:48:20,030
right now, I'm gonna turn the fucking stream

2357
02:48:20,030 --> 02:48:44,610
off. Is this liquid in here?

2358
02:48:44,610 --> 02:48:49,020
I thought, I always thought it was, propane was just

2359
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:51,020
gas. Is this propane

2360
02:48:51,020 --> 02:48:53,020
or is this gasoline?

2361
02:48:53,020 --> 02:48:55,020
Gasoline doesn't explode, does it? When it comes into

2362
02:48:55,020 --> 02:48:57,020
contact with combustible material.

2363
02:48:57,020 --> 02:49:06,420
Yeah, no, gas doesn't

2364
02:49:06,420 --> 02:49:08,979
explode. Not the only light on fire,

2365
02:49:08,979 --> 02:49:10,979
but gasoline, like, unless

2366
02:49:10,979 --> 02:49:12,979
when it comes into contact with combustible material.

2367
02:49:12,979 --> 02:49:14,979
Combustible.

2368
02:49:14,979 --> 02:49:20,290
Not like, gas.

2369
02:49:20,290 --> 02:49:28,670
All right, here's my review for

2370
02:49:28,670 --> 02:49:30,670
Half-Life Alex so far.

2371
02:49:30,670 --> 02:49:33,170
Gunplay, nine.

02:49:41,170 --> 02:49:53,010
backpack. Average it

2376
02:49:53,010 --> 02:49:56,340

2377
02:49:56,340 --> 02:50:00,500
very much weight. What are you gonna

2379
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:17,920
Oh, yeah, best VR game

2380
02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:19,920
ever. I don't know where to go, therefore it's a

2381
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:21,920
bad game. I don't know where to go

2382
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:23,920
right now, therefore it's not a good game.

2383
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:33,309
True. Not true.

2384
02:50:33,309 --> 02:50:36,819
Stupid. Pull these

02:50:39,379 --> 02:50:41,379

02:50:46,739 --> 02:50:52,049
It's great.

2389
02:50:52,049 --> 02:50:54,989
It's very, very good.

2390
02:50:54,989 --> 02:51:00,110
Oh, you can't get me.

2391
02:51:00,110 --> 02:51:02,799
You can't get me. That one you can't get me.

Oh, yeah.

2397
02:52:17,409 --> 02:52:37,440
It's like, like, racquetballs.

2398
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:39,440
It's already playing squash back there.

2399

I guess it's all right.

2408
02:53:33,860 --> 02:53:37,120
Oh, I don't want it.

2409
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:39,120
Guys, stop. Leave me alone.

2410
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:46,020

02:54:16,959 --> 02:54:18,959
I see, dude. I know what you're doing.

2419
02:54:18,959 --> 02:54:21,969

2421
02:54:29,260 --> 02:54:34,190

2427
02:55:02,030 --> 02:55:04,030
a shitty actor.

the vortigaunts are good guys right?

2647
03:53:14,649 --> 03:53:16,649
they don't like the G-man

2648
03:53:16,649 --> 03:53:20,000
don't do it

2649
03:53:20,000 --> 03:53:22,370
you know you know it's available but don't do it

2650
03:53:22,370 --> 03:53:24,370
I never said I would tell them to stay

2651
03:53:24,370 --> 03:53:27,370
no no no no absolutely not

2652
03:53:27,370 --> 03:53:28,370
why would you do that?

2653
03:53:28,370 --> 03:53:31,370
oh they're the bad guys and G-man is the good guy

2654
03:53:31,370 --> 03:53:32,370
nobody knows

2655
03:53:32,370 --> 03:53:34,370
I'll let you know if he gets here

2656
03:53:34,370 --> 03:53:35,370
oh when?

2657
03:53:35,370 --> 03:53:37,370
when he gets here

2658
03:53:37,370 --> 03:53:46,329
that's the G-man

2659
03:53:46,329 --> 03:53:52,129
I mean they never like really made it clear

2660
03:53:52,129 --> 03:53:55,129
it was open to interpretation of what was even going on

2661
03:53:55,129 --> 03:54:00,120
I just you know I'm one of those people

2662
03:54:00,120 --> 03:54:03,120
I think G-man is Gordon Freeman without the goatee on

2663
03:54:03,120 --> 03:54:05,120
and it's like him like thousand years in the future or something

2664
03:54:05,120 --> 03:54:08,120
and going back and like well I'm in that camp

2665

so much pressure in fact that I

2706
03:57:06,069 --> 03:57:10,420
while I hit you reached out for your father's hand

2707
03:57:10,420 --> 03:57:16,500
had his grip would have crushed all the delicate senses in the Russells

2708
03:57:16,500 --> 03:57:17,500

2709
03:57:17,500 --> 03:57:18,500
okay

2710
03:57:18,500 --> 03:57:21,500
totally understandable and would have been worth it by the way

2711
03:57:21,500 --> 03:57:22,500
in this case

2712
03:57:22,500 --> 03:57:23,500
great

2713
03:57:23,500 --> 03:57:28,500
having said that I have a hard time imagining another situation where that would have been the case

2714
03:57:28,500 --> 03:57:29,500
I'm screaming I forgot sorry

2715
03:57:29,500 --> 03:57:32,500

that's it

2722
03:57:55,030 --> 03:58:01,430

2723
03:58:01,430 --> 03:58:08,940

2752
03:59:53,000 --> 03:59:59,319

I'm not loading the save

2757
04:00:05,649 --> 04:00:13,350
anything over here?

2758
04:00:13,350 --> 04:00:19,879
is this where I came from or what?

2759
04:00:19,879 --> 04:00:20,879
I got enough

2760
04:00:20,879 --> 04:00:21,879
I can do it

2761
04:00:21,879 --> 04:00:24,909
see I got enough

2762
04:00:24,909 --> 04:00:25,909
I've got 35

2763
04:00:25,909 --> 04:00:36,329
what actually do I do?

2764
04:00:36,329 --> 04:00:37,329
probably open these somehow right?

2765
04:00:37,329 --> 04:01:01,219
how do I get over there?

2766
04:01:01,219 --> 04:01:04,579
this

2767
04:01:04,579 --> 04:01:07,739
okay let's go

2768
04:01:07,739 --> 04:01:29,370
authorized personnel only

2769
04:01:29,370 --> 04:01:33,180
is a key card of some sort that I don't have

2770
04:01:33,180 --> 04:01:37,860
terminal authority sure

2771
04:01:37,860 --> 04:01:51,559
it's alive

2772
04:01:51,559 --> 04:01:52,559
he's moving

2773
04:01:52,559 --> 04:01:53,559
the guy was clearly moving around

2774
04:01:53,559 --> 04:02:07,469
I tried to do it

2775
04:02:07,469 --> 04:02:10,979
you have a security card?

2776
04:02:10,979 --> 04:02:15,540
perfect

2777
04:02:15,540 --> 04:02:30,739
thank you

2778
04:02:30,739 --> 04:02:33,450
how does it go?

2779
04:02:33,450 --> 04:02:45,819
this

2780
04:02:45,819 --> 04:02:51,290
I think it's the wrong door

2781
04:02:51,290 --> 04:03:11,659
oh this one

2782
04:03:11,659 --> 04:03:12,659
oh it's nothing

2783
04:03:12,659 --> 04:03:23,440
okay whatever

2784
04:03:23,440 --> 04:03:40,549
progress

2785
04:03:40,549 --> 04:03:45,950
it's alive

2786
04:03:45,950 --> 04:03:46,950
you

2787
04:03:46,950 --> 04:03:57,340
can't be serious

2788
04:03:57,340 --> 04:03:58,340
what?

2789
04:03:58,340 --> 04:03:59,340
dead?

2790
04:03:59,340 --> 04:04:00,340
well when it comes to

2791
04:04:00,340 --> 04:04:02,340
combined data encryption

2792
04:04:02,340 --> 04:04:03,340
yay

2793
04:04:03,340 --> 04:04:04,709
yay

2794
04:04:04,709 --> 04:04:05,709
it's robotic

2795
04:04:05,709 --> 04:04:06,709
it works

2796
04:04:06,709 --> 04:04:07,709
I can make short work of those

2797
04:04:07,709 --> 04:04:08,709
I feel like I'm trying to kill a cockroach

2798
04:04:08,709 --> 04:04:09,709
in my living room

2799
04:04:09,709 --> 04:04:12,420
might as well be an alien

2800
04:04:12,420 --> 04:04:17,950
it is an alien

2801
04:04:17,950 --> 04:04:18,950
god damn it man

2802
04:04:18,950 --> 04:04:32,930
wait for a resin

2803
04:04:32,930 --> 04:04:52,159
what makes you wish for a resin?

2804
04:04:52,159 --> 04:04:53,159
big brain resin

2805
04:04:53,159 --> 04:04:56,420
there's a combine over here

2806
04:04:56,420 --> 04:05:02,629
phone in prepared

2807
04:05:02,629 --> 04:05:03,629
fuck this

2808
04:05:03,629 --> 04:05:18,120
shit

2809
04:05:18,120 --> 04:05:29,790
look out the window

2810
04:05:29,790 --> 04:05:30,790
what's that?

2811
04:05:30,790 --> 04:05:32,350
what is that?

2812
04:05:32,350 --> 04:05:34,719
that's gotta be the vault

2813
04:05:34,719 --> 04:05:35,719
yeah

2814
04:05:35,719 --> 04:05:38,719
your dad didn't mention it was floating

2815
04:05:38,719 --> 04:05:41,719
so even if we make it there

2816
04:05:41,719 --> 04:05:42,719
we still have to get up to

2817
04:05:42,719 --> 04:05:44,719
this motherfucker is stealing all the neighbors internet

2818
04:05:44,719 --> 04:05:45,719
all the cables

2819
04:05:45,719 --> 04:05:46,719
look at all the cables attached to it

2820
04:05:46,719 --> 04:05:48,719
all we have to do is follow them

2821
04:05:48,719 --> 04:05:50,719
and break whatever's at the other end

2822
04:05:50,719 --> 04:05:51,719
and down comes the vault

2823
04:05:51,719 --> 04:05:52,719
simple

2824
04:05:52,719 --> 04:05:53,719
simple

2825
04:05:53,719 --> 04:05:55,719
yeah I like this plan

2826
04:05:55,719 --> 04:05:56,719
here

2827
04:05:56,719 --> 04:05:57,719
done

2828
04:05:57,719 --> 04:06:09,500
wait that's a key card

2829
04:06:09,500 --> 04:06:11,629
nice okay

2830
04:06:11,629 --> 04:06:13,629
do I still need this key card?

2831
04:06:13,629 --> 04:06:15,059
or can I

2832
04:06:15,059 --> 04:06:19,120
what about this key

2833
04:06:19,120 --> 04:06:21,120
do I get rid of this key card?

2834
04:06:21,120 --> 04:06:25,920
that's a lot of cables

2835
04:06:25,920 --> 04:06:28,180
is that?

2836
04:06:28,180 --> 04:06:29,180
what do I just throw?

2837
04:06:29,180 --> 04:06:31,000
no I want to

2838
04:06:31,000 --> 04:06:33,000
where'd the ammo go?

2839
04:06:33,000 --> 04:06:48,959
called the injector thing but I don't need it

2840
04:06:48,959 --> 04:06:51,989
I don't need this at all

2841
04:06:51,989 --> 04:06:52,989
I don't need this at all

2842
04:06:52,989 --> 04:06:54,680
take it for fun

2843
04:06:54,680 --> 04:07:02,680
that's a real kind of VR right?

2844
04:07:02,680 --> 04:07:12,500
you guys remember

2845
04:07:12,500 --> 04:07:17,500
some of you older viewers might remember the PSVR shit

2846
04:07:17,500 --> 04:07:19,500
do you guys remember when I was playing the Batman game

2847
04:07:19,500 --> 04:07:21,500
and the thing was so fucked up and so shitty

2848
04:07:21,500 --> 04:07:22,500
and the calibration was so wrong

2849
04:07:22,500 --> 04:07:26,500
that I could not reach my hand this far in front of me

2850
04:07:26,500 --> 04:07:28,500
I had to put a key into a safe

2851
04:07:28,500 --> 04:07:30,500
and I physically couldn't do it

2852
04:07:30,500 --> 04:07:35,379
I feel so nice to actually be able to do this

2853
04:07:35,379 --> 04:07:40,780
it's fun to do that

2854
04:07:40,780 --> 04:07:42,950
okay I got that key card let's go

2855
04:07:42,950 --> 04:07:49,290
that should be for the other door

2856
04:07:49,290 --> 04:07:51,870
healing watch it

2857
04:07:51,870 --> 04:07:55,010
they're gonna break this

2858
04:07:55,010 --> 04:07:57,950
I mean of course they're gonna break this

2859
04:07:57,950 --> 04:07:58,950
fuck you

2860
04:07:58,950 --> 04:08:10,670

2874
04:08:44,219 --> 04:08:46,719
oh my god alright finally

2875
04:08:46,719 --> 04:08:52,389
have you heard any combine chatter about dad escaping?

2876
04:08:52,389 --> 04:08:53,389
no nothing

2877
04:08:53,389 --> 04:08:56,719
no that's not

2878
04:08:56,719 --> 04:08:57,719
on the plus side

2879
04:08:57,719 --> 04:08:59,719
that means dad is still on his way back home

2880
04:08:59,719 --> 04:09:00,719
okay

2881
04:09:00,719 --> 04:09:02,719

04:31:22,680 --> 04:31:25,559
I want you to take this

3070
04:31:25,559 --> 04:31:27,559
this footage I'm doing here

3071
04:31:27,559 --> 04:31:30,629
I want you to put it, like

3072
04:31:30,629 --> 04:31:32,629
cut to it when I'm doing something crazy

3073
04:31:32,629 --> 04:31:35,129
like shooting and stuff

3074
04:31:39,129 --> 04:31:43,020
the editor

3075
04:31:43,020 --> 04:31:45,770
oh, by the way

3076
04:31:45,770 --> 04:31:54,340
if it's not there, you're fired

3077
04:31:54,340 --> 04:32:08,229
I'm kidding

3078
04:32:08,229 --> 04:32:13,479
what's going on in here?

3079
04:32:13,479 --> 04:32:28,950
I can't use it

3080
04:32:28,950 --> 04:32:30,950
I might as well fill up to full health then

3081
04:32:30,950 --> 04:32:38,819
my sweat is dripping

3082
04:32:38,819 --> 04:32:40,819
it's curving down into my nose

3083
04:32:40,819 --> 04:32:44,979
tell people on Twitch you can do it

3084
04:33:04,869 --> 04:33:06,869
the guys up here have no idea

3085
04:33:06,869 --> 04:33:09,619
what's about to happen

3086
04:33:09,619 --> 04:33:11,619
I'm gonna get up here

3087
04:33:11,619 --> 04:33:14,119
I'm gonna get up here

3088
04:33:14,119 --> 04:33:16,119
throw a grenade around the corner

3089
04:34:05,619 --> 04:34:12,979
it's two of them

3090
04:34:12,979 --> 04:34:22,380
oh shit

3091
04:34:22,380 --> 04:34:24,619
that's what the grenades are for

3092
04:34:24,619 --> 04:34:26,619
it's gonna be like a fucking mystery

3093
04:34:26,619 --> 04:34:28,619
magic act for a children's birthday party

3094
04:34:37,049 --> 04:34:39,049
I have two wrist pockets, I do?

3095
04:34:39,049 --> 04:34:41,479
I thought I only had one

3096
04:34:41,479 --> 04:34:54,919
alright, here we go

3097
04:34:54,919 --> 04:34:56,919
no fucking around, this is it right here

3098
04:35:19,560 --> 04:35:28,779
I'm in there, man, alright, shotgun

3099
04:35:28,779 --> 04:35:59,860
I'm bolted, fucking

3100
04:35:59,860 --> 04:36:45,049
wha

3101
04:36:47,049 --> 04:36:52,220

3102
04:36:52,220 --> 04:36:54,220

3103
04:36:54,220 --> 04:37:10,470
sure thing

3104
04:37:10,470 --> 04:37:14,299
got them back

3105
04:37:14,299 --> 04:37:20,950
nice, I knew I was gonna end up over here

3106
04:37:20,950 --> 04:37:33,110
now what?

3107
04:37:33,110 --> 04:37:35,110
the northern star, that's where I wanted me to go

3108
04:37:48,150 --> 04:37:50,150
how dark is that?

3109
04:37:50,150 --> 04:37:54,569
did I move?

3110
04:37:58,569 --> 04:38:00,569
that was just the beginning of an acid base

3111
04:38:02,569 --> 04:38:04,569
I'm gonna go to bed

3112
04:38:04,569 --> 04:38:11,220
I'm doing alright

3113
04:38:11,220 --> 04:38:13,220
I will in a minute

3114
04:38:13,220 --> 04:38:16,229
I'm almost at a checkpoint, right?

3115
04:38:16,229 --> 04:38:21,419
alright, I'm gonna stop

3116
04:38:21,419 --> 04:38:23,419
when I get to a checkpoint

3117
04:38:23,419 --> 04:38:25,590
whatever the next checkpoint is

3118
04:38:25,590 --> 04:38:50,340
shit

3119
04:38:50,340 --> 04:38:52,520
not gonna hide shit from me, dude

3120
04:38:52,520 --> 04:39:00,459
no, I don't have two wrist slots

3121
04:39:00,459 --> 04:39:03,529
I thought you guys said I had two

3122
04:39:03,529 --> 04:39:08,389
you guys lied to me

3123
04:39:08,389 --> 04:39:11,340
I said I had two

3124
04:39:11,340 --> 04:39:13,340
alright, hotel arc incoming

3125
04:39:13,340 --> 04:39:15,340
alright, here we go

3126
04:39:15,340 --> 04:39:25,509
alright, there's nothing fucking in there

3127
04:39:25,509 --> 04:39:39,450
alright, here we, there we go

3128
04:39:39,450 --> 04:39:41,450
hotel, in the hotel now

3129
04:39:41,450 --> 04:39:43,450
now I can stop

3130
04:39:43,450 --> 04:39:50,869
you could have killed someone

3131
04:39:50,869 --> 04:39:53,819
now we can stop

3132
04:39:53,819 --> 04:39:57,529
that was a ton of fun, this is great

3133
04:39:57,529 --> 04:39:59,959
I understand why

3134
04:39:59,959 --> 04:40:01,959
everyone says this is the game to play

3135
04:40:01,959 --> 04:40:03,959
it's very very fun

3136
04:40:03,959 --> 04:40:07,799
it's very fun

3137
04:40:07,799 --> 04:40:10,869
it's not too overbearing

3138
04:40:10,869 --> 04:40:12,869
sometimes you stay in these games for like 3 or 4 hours

3139
04:40:12,869 --> 04:40:14,869
it gets delayed

3140
04:40:14,869 --> 04:40:16,869
this is good, this is solid

3141
04:40:16,869 --> 04:40:19,500
I just wanna see what's inside here

3142
04:40:21,500 --> 04:40:25,529
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, that was cool

3143
04:40:25,529 --> 04:40:29,180
and the power's out

3144
04:40:29,180 --> 04:40:31,419
looks like we're taking a stair

3145
04:40:31,419 --> 04:40:35,619
alright, save

3146
04:40:35,619 --> 04:40:37,619
northern star, chapter 5

3147
04:40:37,619 --> 04:40:39,619
the northern star

3148
04:40:39,619 --> 04:40:41,619
that's, this one's good, right?

3149
04:40:41,619 --> 04:40:43,619
save right there

3150
04:40:43,619 --> 04:40:50,069
yeah, we're good

3151
04:40:50,069 --> 04:40:52,069
there's a piano?

3152
04:40:52,069 --> 04:40:54,069
alright, I gotta play, wait wait wait

3153
04:40:54,069 --> 04:41:05,590
there's a piano

3154
04:41:05,590 --> 04:41:07,590
I don't even care, I just wanna play the piano

3155
04:41:07,590 --> 04:41:15,720
get the fuck off me

3156
04:41:21,979 --> 04:41:26,970
play the piano, I don't care

3157
04:41:55,319 --> 04:41:57,619
don't ever have children

3158
04:41:57,619 --> 04:41:59,619
and have a piano in the house

3159
04:41:59,619 --> 04:42:01,619
I just wanna make sure I warn everybody about that

3160
04:42:01,619 --> 04:42:03,619
cause you'll get this

3161
04:42:03,619 --> 04:42:12,139
they'll do it every day

3162
04:42:12,139 --> 04:42:16,419
it's not enough

3163
04:42:16,419 --> 04:42:18,419
it's not good enough

3164
04:42:18,419 --> 04:42:20,419
oh, that's not gonna get me anything

3165
04:42:20,419 --> 04:42:22,419
I won't win the grammy

3166
04:42:22,419 --> 04:42:27,159
open this fucking thing up

3167
04:42:27,159 --> 04:42:45,770
oh, that was fun

3168
04:42:45,770 --> 04:42:47,770
alright, see you guys later, see you this weekend

3169
04:42:47,770 --> 04:42:56,279
I can't get out, I can't leave

3170
04:42:56,279 --> 04:42:58,580
I can't leave, I'm stuck

3171
04:42:58,580 --> 04:43:02,470
get out

3172
04:43:02,470 --> 04:43:04,470
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out

3173
04:43:04,470 --> 04:43:07,349
I'm out

3174
04:43:07,349 --> 04:43:10,169
that was a lot of fun

3175
04:43:10,169 --> 04:43:12,169
now that I come out

3176
04:43:12,169 --> 04:43:14,169
I just take a cheese sub, right

3177
04:43:14,169 --> 04:43:16,729
I'm gonna just take a cheese sub

3178
04:43:16,729 --> 04:43:18,729
and take a shower

3179
04:43:18,729 --> 04:43:24,419
I have two slots on each wrist

3180
04:43:24,419 --> 04:43:30,740
oh yeah

3181
04:43:30,740 --> 04:43:32,740
yeah, it's been almost five hours, I'm surprised

3182
04:43:32,740 --> 04:43:39,979
that was fun

3183
04:43:39,979 --> 04:43:41,979
alright, I'll see you guys on Saturday, we'll come back with something else

3184
04:43:41,979 --> 04:43:46,970
you were in there for a while?

3185
04:43:46,970 --> 04:43:48,970
yeah, I was, I only took like two breaks

3186
04:43:48,970 --> 04:43:53,959
I usually take like five

3187
04:43:53,959 --> 04:43:55,959
we'll see how I feel, I'm either gonna come back on Saturday with Alex

3188
04:43:55,959 --> 04:43:57,959
or we'll do some other VR stuff

3189
04:43:57,959 --> 04:43:59,959
or we might take a break from VR and then come back on Sunday

3190
04:43:59,959 --> 04:44:01,959
I don't know, it's all set up so I might as well do it

3191
04:44:01,959 --> 04:44:04,900
he's never gonna play this again

3192
04:44:04,900 --> 04:44:09,939
it'll be fucked up

3193
04:44:09,939 --> 04:44:11,939
but here come the subs, thanks everybody, actually let me see

3194
04:44:11,939 --> 04:44:14,310
I probably missed some shit, I did

3195
04:44:14,310 --> 04:44:18,860
it was a huge amount of money

3196
04:44:18,860 --> 04:44:21,479
given a little while ago

3197
04:44:21,479 --> 04:44:23,479

04:44:23,479 --> 04:44:25,479

Muffin, that's insane

3202
04:44:35,740 --> 04:44:37,740
thanks for the ridiculous amount of money

3203
04:44:37,740 --> 04:44:39,740
an amount of money that I can't believe any

3204
04:44:39,740 --> 04:44:41,740
one human would give

3205
04:44:41,740 --> 04:44:44,540
one human to me

3206
04:44:44,540 --> 04:44:47,029

04:44:47,029 --> 04:44:50,740

3224
04:45:53,419 --> 04:45:55,419

3242
04:46:57,270 --> 04:46:59,580
so back when I was, I had like

3243
04:46:59,580 --> 04:47:01,819
maybe like

3244
04:47:01,819 --> 04:47:04,759
50,000 subs on YouTube

3245
04:47:04,759 --> 04:47:06,759
I went to like a party, like a machinima party

3246
04:47:06,759 --> 04:47:09,130
and I didn't fucking know anybody

3247
04:47:09,130 --> 04:47:11,130
I was just like a guy that was there
