100
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,480
Uh, I think I think I think you move every time

101
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,110
Okay, maybe I think I don't know but either way this is you guys asking me where the vape pen is

102
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,790
I was actually gonna get one but I didn't want to get like addicted to nicotine for a joke

103
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,310
I it was like last second. I was gonna go to like the gas station and get one

104
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,529
I know

105
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,129
So, uh, what were the rules again, there was some very specific rules we had to follow, right?

106
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:15,699
Okay, one is no tanks. So there's tanks you can get inside of and drive around those are banned and it's honor system

107
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:21,079
You just can't get in them. Uh, there are battle buses that are very chunky and big you can get in those

108
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,670
But tanks are uh, and then the other rule is no using tents

109
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,949
Which you're not going to worry about but it's a way to transport good weapons across games

110
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:33,509
So like you can go into a tent that you find

111
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:39,350
A weapon that you've stored, you know in the tent, which is like this universal bookshelf and pull it

112
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:46,470
You can't do that. So okay doesn't really apply to us because we're honorable fighters sap nap. Hello guys. I'm on the team now

113
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,789
What's up? It's a pleasure to have you. We are the best team here. That's true

114
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:56,549
All right, we're gonna win. I've got some pretty good fps, uh background. I'm not concerned about it

115
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,269
That's and that's what i've been saying

116
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:08,460
To all the haters the fakes. Yeah, I got I got I got some I can do it. We got to kick final k out forever

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:53,240
I mean so many star quests and they're all from people with faze in their name. All right trying to buy some nnts, bro

128
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:13,610

Okay, is it friendly fire? No, no

130
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,139
We should try and land on one of the uh blimps and i'm down over because once you take over the blimp

131
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,409
It's a really good people like rarely come up to fight you and if you do you have high ground

132
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:33,049
Yeah, I like that that map for context germa has not ever played fortnight

133
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:39,450
Which should be a problem it shouldn't know but I believe there should be a sort of a get down mr

134
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,450
president strategy employed

135
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,100
I mean I

Because this is war. Well, we got this i'm actually excited a good squad

00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:56,139
What team were you on sapnap? I was on connor's team

153
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,279

156
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:12,169
No, no building building's off, but it's gonna come with like ancient knowledge that only he could have oh, thank god

157
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,419
I was about to be very sad

158
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:18,809
You do not say jfk 985

159
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:22,659
In this chat

160
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,129
So, uh, how do I toggle aim?

161
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:34,009
Right click

162
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:38,419
Oh, I see. I see ads. I don't I like to toggle. I don't like to hold

163
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,659
Oh, you want to change it? Uh, I see. Okay, so you're gonna go to your settings

164
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,470
You're gonna click the uh arrow keys on the right third to right third to last. Uh-huh. Um,

165
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:58,470
Let's see this. I got this target, but there's no target toggle. Oh, man. Maybe you're right

166
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:02,230
Maybe you can't do that. Can you really not? Um, am I the only person that cares about that?

167
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:07,500
You're not no, you are not I don't but you are not the only person

168
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,179
You are weird and different but we accept you here

169
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,740
I made a script to do toggle in um, that revenant game revenant. Oh, I found it. I found it

170
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:24,059
It's the second the gear icon on the top in the second menu. It's toggle targeting in combat section

171
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,059
Oh targeting in

172
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,279
So you scroll down to combat in the in the gear icon

173
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,990
Uh on in your settings menu and just toggle targeting on oh, hell. Yeah

174
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:41,990
And so you are seen invalid in the eyes of fortnight. Yeah, that's cool. I'm happy about it

175
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,710
I said I don't want to show like

176
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,899
I'm just gonna see something right now. I'm gonna steal me. Uh sapnap. Do you have a

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,330
Balenciaga skin or yeah, I do I can run it

178
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:01,529
I mean that would be huge because that would mean a lot it would be like we're the three balenciaga secret agents

179
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,009
And then we have germo

180
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:07,529
Is there like a default like skins I can choose from

181
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,570
Uh, yeah, there are I think

182
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:15,610
I think I know I don't think there's any broke talk in this game. I'm not kidding

183
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:23,620
I don't think there's you can't oh you just randomized. I mean, I mean I just downloaded the game like an hour ago

188
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:50,710

190
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,370

Internet to give me the spider-man skin

Do you have spider-man in your thing? I don't I don't

198
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:31,429
Spider-man I had him but that was like a week ago

199
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:39,419
Wait spider-man was in your shop. Yeah, he was in like the the bottom of the shop or maybe it somebody said, uh

200
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,070
Odd watchers skip. I don't think you want to skip this and by the way, this is not the only thing i'm doing today

201
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,720
I got a very big plans today. I got

202
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,460
Every boss in every from souls game tier list that i'm going to take a lot of time on and it's ready to go

203
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,779
That's happening after this. I think

204
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,019
I think dude there there's a splash screen when I loaded a game earlier

205
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,620
And it said only you can prevent vbuck like stealing and says don't share your account info and there's like a cat

206
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
pointing at the screen

207
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,860
I was like damn they they this is this is the good message

208
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:20,940
Everybody's freaking out saying that I should turn on the streamer mode because the dmca music

209
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:27,899
Oh, yeah, yes, there's doja cat. There's real music in the car when you get in unless you want to get fucking crazy

210
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm crazy. I feel like I i just leave it on that is i don't know what's getting but i'll be honest

211
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,799
Do I really care if the fortnight section of this stream gets nuked?

212
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:43,019
What are they gonna do send the weekend? I i am honestly if if this if this gets like muted this part of the stream

213
00:16:43,100 --> 00:17:08,819
And I don't really necessarily care

214
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,099
You also like can't cancel it. Okay licensed audio mute all

215
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,779
Yeah, why is it gondam style? That's so good. Yeah, there's a dance

216
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,710
Uh, it's just so big 10 years ago and they brought it back for fortnight

217
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,740
There's no music replacements. You just kind of do that. I don't think there's no I don't I don't think

218
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:46,650
Why do I feel like the whole game muted? But no, it's um, good to see you guys again. We're good to hear from you again

219
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,309
Yes, sir. We were we were very excited to hear that you were our captain

220
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,410
I found out I was your captain when um, I can't when I came in the call, so i'm ready to leave the ship

221
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,839
Steer it in the right direction

222
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,599
Yeah

223
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,400
A ludwig augren production. Can I can I paint you a little picture of how we how we got here?

224
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:12,099
So last fortnight monday, um, we had a son on our team

225
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,069
uh

226
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:19,910
Who has played a little more than you have but has has played probably a just as significant amount of as you have

227
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,809
And uh, we got destroyed. We got second to last

228
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:30,859
Um since then ludwig nick me and hasan since then we have put in some serious hours

229
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,859
We've been dropping tilted constantly

230
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Uh, we've been discussing strategy

231
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:36,940
um

232
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
We consulted our friend's little brother

233
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:42,869
Uh, because he that was huge that was because he because he's like 16

234
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:48,089
So we asked him how he would approach this and I think we're ready to place top three

235
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:55,619
I I mean look I I might not know fortnight, but you get the you take the building out

236
00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:01,319
I have like three four thousand hours in team fortress too. Yeah, you point and you shoot, you know

237
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,390
And I mean like I've just completed elden ring. It's just a better cartoon shooter

238
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:12,039
You're gonna be fine. Yeah, you got it. Everybody said congratulations, but it's all right

239
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,160
Oh, you're talking about yeah, it's super weird

240
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,640
Well, I mean I just said I just I just completed elden ring and I just figured that it was gonna get like a bunch of like

241
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,220
Claps and stuff, but no. Yeah, I heard that I I heard that so

242
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:34,900
Fortnight so better what what are people spending better for no one asked?

243
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Codes up codes up. Oh

244
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:52,059
Okay, putting our code in so should I ready up? Um once I do yeah

245
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,230
At sapnap. It's a pleasure to meet you by the way

246
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:01,480
All right. We should be able to ready

247
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,079
I have the code in

248
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, sorry. I was using the restroom. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I had my wireless headset on

249
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,619
You were listening to us while you were in the restroom. Yeah, you did special

250
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,250
That's the bond. I just left my headset on muted my mic got up and went to pee

251
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:21,130
That's a good idea actually and I heard just in case I was gonna miss someone is it time to ready up?

252
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:28,740
Uh, I think so. Yeah, i'm hitting it. Uh, should we just do it? Yes, sir. All right

253
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:33,259
Surprise for the table. I gotta put both headphones in for this

254
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,640
Okay, jerma big big, uh big thing for I think battle royales in general

255
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,000
The worst thing you can hear when your teammate when something is happening to your teammate is they're over there

256
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,200
Because no one knows what you're talking about, right? So there's a ping button

257
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:58,170
I believe it's mapped to z very helpful for saying over there and then it's like beep beep. You got it also

258
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:07,559
Um, I do have some battle royale experience not with this one of g-mobile. Okay, wait

259
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:15,539
Mobile, that's not a joke. I actually I played the mobile pubg a lot of airport hours. Were you nice, sir?

260
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,710
I mean I was just in I was just did it in bed just lying in bed

261
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:24,180
Oh, yeah, I think you need to ready up nick. I did what?

262
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,380
So I understand the concept of the shrinking zone of like the landing in different places picking up web

263
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:37,660
Okay, what's a good weapon? What should I be looking for? I think the the meta is like aug plus. Um, what's the the shotgun?

264
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:40,859
the big amount of ammo

265
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:45,099
The drum one I think drum. Yeah, I think it's aug plus drum plus

266
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:54,180
Uh the things that launch you and then two heels is what I was told. That's like the meta. There's uh, there's smgs

267
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:56,039
They're kind of unwieldy

268
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,829
Usually not worth it

269
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:02,470
But the the rifles are like where your bread and butter is going to be are your mouths moving on your characters when you know

270
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:04,549
They're not okay. Oh, yeah the dog

271
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:16,309
Everyone keeps saying that I was like, whoa, that's kind of cool. Are we supposed to switch to na west?

272
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,420
We are on na west. Oh, okay. This ain't gonna start in 30 minutes, right?

273
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,559
Um, it should start immediately or once everyone's ready once everyone's in

274
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,400
I think the 30 minute thing you're seeing is like a different thing. It's like the duo tournament. Okay pop up

275
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:42,549
I feel like I feel like i'm gonna surprise a lot of people

276
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:50,440
Why does it say only 28 cute am I I didn't do it wrong, right? No, I think i'm just waiting or

277
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,869
No, i'm not buying i'm not gonna buy a skin. No, it's too late. I'm just gonna play

278
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:01,900
Remember you might be cracked in this I might be this is a surprise to us

279
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,730
Yeah, I didn't I wasn't expecting that but I mean it's whatever i'm ready to i'm ready to game

280
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:18,279
Ready to click heads. Oh, yeah, I love that dude. So I know this this healing right like bandages and that kind of thing

281
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,839
Yeah

282
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,079
Yeah

283
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,359
So big big thing you want to remember if you so there's little pots and small pots and they give you different amounts of shield

284
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,319
Uh, you're gonna want to use those little pots first

285
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,119
Okay

286
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:33,160
The reason being is if you already have 50 shield and you try to take a little pot the game doesn't let you

287
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:37,210
So you want to use the little pots to hit 50 and then use the big pot to hit 100

288
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,859
Yo, can one of you guys discord live stream?

289
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:44,380
uh

290
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:54,730
Yeah, I probably should be me ty just one. Thank you. I love it a little late, but uh

291
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:04,279
The thought that counts I work on like 1500 millisecond ping so you get the internal delay

292
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:15,269
So that happens when you're almost 40 one day the zoomers will be old bro. Not me. That'll be funny. You guys

293
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,490
Not um, i'm chilling

294
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
I've been using lotion. I'm like all

295
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,339
I'm all slippery and

296
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,740
Hard to catch. No, no, seriously though. Actually actually moisturize your faces like seriously do that

297
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,859
I was once told by a makeup professional doing makeup on my face for a thing

298
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,619
She said if you moisturize you will never age and she said it with like this ancient wisdom and I was like, yes

299
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,619
Okay, now that that's actually dead serious like when you come out of the shower

300
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:51,420
You had like a really good light face moisturizer. That should be the first thing you do after you dry your face

301
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:58,859
Dry your face. Let it sit for a second moisturize. Trust me. I'm gonna remember this forever

302
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:07,750
You your 40 year old face is gonna thank you when you're fucking 40 and old and weird. You'll be looking smooth

303
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:13,509
Moist I might be weird, but i'll be in otter. I'll be moving around

304
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,859
You should have a whole skincare routine. I don't know. It should really we really should be pushing this

305
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:23,190
I think it's hard for dudes, you know

306
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,890
I wasn't caught this, you know as a young man

307
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,109
I just ate taco bell and wore hoodies and rolled around

308
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:36,630
And slop. Yeah, so so that's not dude culture. I think you're trying to imply that

309
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,829
I didn't I wasn't doing that

310
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,549
Yeah, I know. It's just like the normal like american

311
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:47,990
And rolled around and slop. Yeah, it's like what you did. Like it's what I did culturally

312
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:52,869
I am literate. He's from colorado is kind of like part of the whole yeah is what I think there colorado is nice

313
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,430
I like colorado colorado. Yeah, it's some great slop

314
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:15,160
People say i'm actually the american psycho no, I I just like I I want to take care of my face

315
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:25,369
Is it psychotic to moisturize honestly once this goes it's over dude you as a patrick bateman deep fake is so funny

316
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,059
I'm thinking about that right now

317
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:34,420
One of my favorite moments I think it's like jackass one the movie, uh, it's like johnny noxville like

318
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,299
He he he gets hit by like a claymore mine that has like rubber balls in it

319
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:45,059
And they hit him all over his body his body's like insanely bruised and he's like kind of limping out after it happens

320
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:50,180
And he's like circling his face. He's like is this okay face good. Oh, we're good. Right?

321
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:54,819
No, it's true. I mean I used to be in the gym all the time

322
00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:00,259
I used to work out all the time like three four days a week and then like I started to kind of get like that

323
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:06,230
Weird like attack on titan monster body where like my my like stomach's like too big

324
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,829
But like my shoulders are not wide enough to make sense and my like waist is small. My ass is huge

325
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,170
Yeah, you look like you look like someone was just fucking around in the tony hawk building character

326
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,529
Can be kind of uh, so I mean I gotta make sure this stays around

327
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,619
And the hair too the hair's got to stick around for a while too. I gotta be honest with you

328
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:29,839
Yeah, I started to look like the pill from osmosis jones

329
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,349
Uh

330
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,119
People are demanding I buy a skin. I don't what's what's even available. You should buy a skin

331
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,200
I wasn't gonna say that but I don't want to like go get my credit card mentioned it

332
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:57,519
Yeah, get get your money up. Not your phone up. Yeah, it's pretty big. Do I have to put my credit card in?

333
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,740
Well, it's it's not gonna run on magic. This isn't unicef

334
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,220
Hold on. Let me let me turn all my kid

335
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,420
I don't want anyone to see like the reflection of my eyes of my screen putting my credit card in

336
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,839
How much money how much money do I need?

337
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,880
Uh

338
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,240
How much what's the v-book transfer like 20 30 100 bucks, whatever?

339
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,400

340
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,619
Oh

341
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:30,200
About 100 the 799 one. How about that one? That's pretty good. Thank god. I'm not showing this on screen, right? No

342
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:38,349
Yeah, thousands enough for like like bubble gum or like maybe like one of your shoes

343
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:42,589
Okay, so add funds to wallet right place the order

344
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,009
Did it work?

345
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:48,509
Thank you. Okay, so I should have

346
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:54,329
Okay. So now if I go to item shop, I have a thousand I have one thousand v bucks

347
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,890
Okay, it doesn't sound as much as it might be but that will get you a skin. All right. So what what should I do?

348
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:06,809
Well now you can go to the item shop on the top and sort of browse and anything you can afford

349
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:09,769
Which is not much for the thousand it is true

350
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:17,180
You can but I think you can get i'm seeing envoy which is like a hot like green haired spy woman

351
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,839
um, you don't have enough for the

352
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,529
Fish in astronaut suit. I don't have enough to do this. I have to buy the

353
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,329
I'd buy on okay. What else is there?

354
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,930
This is the only thing that's available. This is all that's available. It's envoy or I believe wind walker echo

355
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,720
Which is like a sort of like a mage. I don't know

356
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:53,359
Wind it's uncommon green. Oh, okay wind walker echo. I guess i'm gonna do

357
00:29:53,839 --> 00:30:02,990
Envoy what matches more with you guys envoy is very is much more dripped out

358
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:09,069
Like wind walker is like a fantasy character, right? We're dogs wearing balenciaga, which has nothing to do with fantasy, right?

359
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:19,019
All right. So i'm gonna put another thousand v bucks in my man. I should have just bought the other one

360
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,430
Wait, can you not get the how much is the the dog?

361
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:31,470
For me, it says 600 but maybe it's because already I don't know. Um, dude

362
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:35,710
I missed the I missed the 12 extra coins too for me. The dog says 1200

363
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:42,700
Okay, maybe that just like upgrades the dog. I think it's because okay. I see. It's like a I see

364
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,990
Because I own some of it. It's less. Yeah, I got the pack. So it doesn't even show me the um, the price anymore

365
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,440
Okay, I got two I got two thousand v bucks. You don't want to put that skin on before the match starts

366
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,829
Which is in like a minute. So you want to click locker in the top? Okay, but when you buy it

367
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,950
Oh you oh after you buy they already bought it my bad big chungus. That's what I was thinking is is really your style

368
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:13,160
Because he looks like the attack on time guy like he looks like he has like guys screaming

369
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,559
That would look great on you

370
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,720
Fuck it up germa. How do I claim this?

371
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,660
Wait, I think I think it's starting right now. You might be fucked. He's got it equipped. Did I do it? We're in

372
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:35,640
Did I equip it? All right, let's fucking go. This is not gonna be close. That's what i've been saying. I think I got it

373
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:53,579
Yes, okay. I'm i'm assuming sapnap. You are the best player here. Yes, uh, I bestow that upon you

374
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,059
And so what what that means for me is I want you to feel comfortable making shot calls

375
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:05,720
And we will we will follow you as if you are a compass command cavern. We should drop like right now

376
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,259
All right dropping. Okay, it's spacebar germa because I know all right, we need to fight for the blimp

377
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:16,890
There's gonna be people here. So try and grab a gun immediately and take control of them

378
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:18,730
Got it

379
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,259
Oh, there's npcs that that are gonna be on this blimp. They're called io soldiers

380
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:30,029
They're not real characters, but they can uh, they can dice you up. It doesn't look like we have too many people here with us

381
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:38,480
Nice. There's one other at least one other player for sure

382
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,450
Guys how do I land?

383
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,009
Oh, what?

384
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:03,769
What do you mean? What's what's oh you're on top? Yeah, you gotta find a way in

385
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,569
You can also maybe pickaxe the roof and get in. Oh people are shooting at us. I'm in i'm in i'm in

386
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,170
Okay

387
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:21,759
Oh, that's pretty big. I need a weapon

388
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:30,039
Oh i'm getting beamed what the hell is what is that? Oh, it's the fucking teleporting. Uh,

389
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:37,000
Dude doctor doctor scones. Yeah, he's downstairs if you guys might kill him and get his good gun. He's got a gun

390
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
He's kind of scary

391
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,509
Oh fuck i've never seen this guy to be honest. I got I got a gun

392
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:47,309
He's really beefy, but if we all shoot him he dies kind of fast

393
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,329
Here you go

394
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:53,769
Yeah, i'm coming to you

395
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:55,130
fire

396
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:09,199
Where'd he go?

397
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,440
Oh

398
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,440
I'm dead over here. I think it's a real guy. Yeah

399
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,280
real person

400
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,050
I'm down i'm down

401
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,050
I'm coming up the back back back back back back

402
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,309
No way

403
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:28,349
We got destroyed

404
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,909
No way

405
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:35,789
Restarting restarting restarting

406
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:36,750
Huh?

407
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,590
Wait, we're restarting

408
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,590
Oh, yes, that's so big

409
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:44,030
Yes, sir

410
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,389
So we just get in the lobby we just get killed. Yeah, just back out just back out

411
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,070
Okay, jeremy jeremy we're restarting that game didn't count we got really lucky. Oh, wow

412
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:55,469
Return to love it. Okay. I did not know that fucking guy was gonna be there

413
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,809
Yeah, we had to we dealt with the npc and then we got run up on yeah

414
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:03,929
Okay, someone in tarik's team is really bad

415
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,440
I don't know who it was. I saw I don't know who it was but they were like, yeah, they were really good

416
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:12,440
Oh, that was probably slicker. Oh, we know that's not on their team. Wait, who's their new player?

417
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,500
So that was an npc we were fighting

418
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:20,539
The teleporting person really the really powerful guy was an npc, but then a real team dropped on our blimp

419
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,179
Oh crap, there's a new there's a new code now

420
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:29,449
Okay, i'll put that in

421
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,059
I was unlucky that we just randomly got put off the spawn next to those guys. Holy shit. Yeah

422
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:38,460
once they like

423
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,900
Once tarik and I don't even know who else got in there. They just annihilated us

424
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:47,579
Maybe it's better to fly or go to like a further blimp only because like really confident players like them are just going to insta drop

425
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:52,860
Yeah, I didn't I wanted I chose that one because I didn't see other like the ones that were further

426
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,019
All the ones I saw were tilted and what's the other crossroad one whatever it's called

427
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,059
Yeah, and I know that puns's team was gonna go for one of those two and I didn't want to fight puns. Oh fair enough

428
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:12,010
You got a new code in did you get the new code in nick? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I I read it up. All right ready

429
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:17,659
Uh, jeremy got ready up. Oh, yeah, my bad. It's only four games instead of five

430
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:23,099
So local bars is bad documented. So that might be the person on tarix. Why did why would restarting what happened?

431
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:27,199
Uh, I don't know there must have been some error and then we also lost time

432
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,679
So now there's only four matches instead of five. Oh, okay

433
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,889
So I think I have enough to buy one dance this time. Oh, that's so big. That is so big that helps

434
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,510
How about no sweat test it out? See how you like it? Sure

435
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:53,440
Whatever dude, I can't get the the gamer rage wanting. Oh my god my shop refresh. That's crazy

436
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,059
Because it looked a lot like this. So no head

437
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,659
That's not the right one

438
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:12,010
I know that's the default dance. Oh, yes, sir. Good luck slime. Thank you protect saikuno from guns insane name to have in chat

439
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:19,679
But also I agree. Why did your guy only use one hand for that dance? Is that a thing? I think that's the dance

440
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:26,409
That one just tilts me

441
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:31,530
Yeah, I just get mad looking at it. Just know after I kill someone I will be popping this. Yeah

442
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,570
I'm right there with you

443
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Do

444
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,039
The one-handed floss

445
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:59,289
So I so badly want to do this at one of the fortnight concerts. Wait, is it okay? No, that's it's the code

446
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:07,480
We're already on. Okay, someone's a tarik scene thought we were randoms. Why would they think that that's weird to think

447
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:13,719
Why would you think royale come in my way is anyone but german 95? That's such a bot name

448
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,719
Randoms

449
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,079
Swag is for men

450
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:26,639
Yeah, these do at least a couple of these feel like bot names. I'll have a papa for sure

451
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,460
Pan i've had i've had this day since season two. Is it pen is the is the

452
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,599
It's just supposed to be pandas, but like pandas is taken

453
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,320
I got it. So I just was like

454
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,840
Till then it does it does mess with the brain a bit because you want to say pan

455
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,400
Does pan does a human mouth doesn't allow for that

456
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,460
Some people saying they can get thanos. Yeah thanos in the game

457
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,739
Thor dude, no shit will smith is in this game

458
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,460
Uh, I think moist had it on last week right after the the oscar's thing

459
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,739
It was really funny to see will smith jumping around but

460
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:10,480
I wouldn't have picked like the saturday morning cartoon bane if I knew that I could get thanos

461
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,900
Yeah, that's the thing you got to tune in next shop to see what what the vbucks you can spend you know

462
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:23,610
That's how they get you. Oh, so you can't just go back into the catalog and buy a bunch of stuff that they did

463
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:30,320
Yeah, I guess that adds exclusivity to it, right in a way

464
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,159
Do you guys think that um, what are your thoughts on the three stooges making their appearance here in the next few weeks?

465
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,119
I think that it's a game where four people can squad up. So there's an instant problem

466
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:50,809
Wow, that's true. Unless there was a fourth stooge like the bonus jonas

467
00:39:51,130 --> 00:40:04,320
Well, what about mo or curly or something? You think that they have a chance with the bowl cut maybe yeah shemp

468
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,679
Everyone should have to play as the beetles

469
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:15,260
Oh shit, the beetles could be added. No, that's fucked up because two of them two of them were murdered bro. You can't do that

470
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:18,300
You literally can't all right. Here we go. Here we go

471
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:29,210
By the way, Anthony paul mccartney is a fig if the three stooges are the three stooges are not added to this game

472
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:31,769
By april 23rd, I believe I have to eat a glove on stream

473
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:38,409
That is a that is so unfortunate like a latex glove or like a mechanic

474
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,409
I mean, I I was so confident like two years ago. I gave a random date in the future

475
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,550
You know, I have a friend that did the same thing

476
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:50,190
He he said at the beginning of 2018. Dr. Phil will die this year and he didn't

477
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:57,690
So kind of kind of ate his own words on that one. What do you mean go here? Um, let's see

478
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,489
Maybe we can crank whatever this is

479
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,119
Yeah, i'm done. I'll be late. Yeah, let's do it

480
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,869
Yep

481
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:10,460
I think the later too the more safe we get well, I don't know

482
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:14,380
I think everyone I think everyone is thinking that so it's kind of a toss-up

483
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,980
I do like this spot though. I think I think we can do a lot of good work

484
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:20,139
We can see there's a lot of people dropping right now

485
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
So we're waiting we're waiting to get all the way to the end here

486
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,679
Yeah, drop drop when it says like 900 on the meters away from the ping. Oh

487
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:35,099
I guess you could like maybe now. Yeah, i'm gonna go now. I don't really see too many people so

488
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,099
Looks good

489
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:39,960
What's the best way to make it so I go over there and not across the whole game?

490
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:42,800
um

491
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,960
I don't exactly know what you're saying. You can you can pop your thing early by pressing space bar

492
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,119
Okay, if you don't want to go too low. Yeah

493
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,320
Which should be fine for where we're dropping because you want to be higher

494
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:56,699
I think we're good. I don't think anyone's dropping here

495
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,119
We might be able to loot the town under us too and then come back up

496
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:03,239
This actually looks really good and there's gonna be cars in this town. So we don't have to worry about circle

497
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:09,849
Oh, there's one person

498
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:11,369
So it's probably one team

499
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:13,210
So we're going into the blimp

500
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,969
Yeah, they missed the blimp. They're gonna go they're gonna. Oh, no, they made it they're going inside right now

501
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,250
I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm so sorry

502
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:26,110
I I picked I hit a pixel. Did you fall? Yeah, I fell i'll come down

503
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:30,010
I'm so sorry

504
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,340
They're inside

505
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,099
I'm gonna revive nick and come right back up

506
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,300
It might be worth to actually bail on the blimp because we have two down here

507
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,699
Yeah, there's one on top of right now if I jump off my safe

508
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,969
If you if you jump off you can you'll take the ball down we might have to just like hit the town

509
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:56,969
Right in front of me

510
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:01,449
I'm going for a gun

511
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,469
Right there shit

512
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:13,070
Okay, fuck we're actually just only play that was mendo xqc

513
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,760
Holy shit, we're playing the best game right now

514
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:22,840
Dude, i've never played one minute of this game. Okay. I don't even I don't know how to land the fucking sky dive

515
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:26,159
Uh, that was that wasn't bad

516
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:31,719
Ludwig, what are you doing in the call? Oh, sorry. Sorry. Just spectating. What do you want? Ludwig?

517
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,960
I'll do what you guys are doing spectating

518
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:38,880
I don't like this guy anyone else sort of sharing that feeling

519
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:46,269
Did did you think it's fair that tarik is playing this video game? Oh, he must be gone. Oh, he's gone

520
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:49,679
Yeah, he left. So what happened there?

521
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:57,179
Um, okay, I trolled, uh, my my character's foot hit like a pixel which made me insta drop off my

522
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:00,730
Parasail and then I just went straight down. Oh shit

523
00:44:01,289 --> 00:44:06,090
And then we dropped with maybe the best team in the lobby at the moment. Oh

524
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:14,539
People going for blimps. Are we uh screwing ourselves by going blimp? We might have to we might have to

525
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,639
With that with an audible

526
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:23,159
That's fine. What I think what is in the blimp? That's very important

527
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:26,440
It's less about what's in there and it's more that you have high ground constantly

528
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:30,119
Okay, and and teams like the whole goal is just to live the longest, right?

529
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:33,800
So if you can like have a really high spot where it's hard for people to kill you

530
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:42,280
Uh then and also be in a place where people don't often like try to take over late then it's just good

531
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:51,449
This person's in a tent. No, dude, if they're tenting i'm not a narc. I would never oh wait

532
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,170
Wait, what happened?

533
00:44:55,130 --> 00:45:02,409
Wait, maybe you're maybe you're allowed to tent to heal but not to store

534
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:08,559
I think we ran into some bad luck boys and I think it's it's no it's no big deal

535
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,079
i'm telling you

536
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,559
Just give me a weapon and I and I and i'll shine

537
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,340
I don't think I haven't held a weapon either one of these two

538
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,579
Dude shroudy shroud is just literally melting. No

539
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,239
He took out mango's team single-handedly

540
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:36,590
He's the he is god's gift to all of gaming and he's in the same tournament moki got tarik. Okay, good to know

541
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:46,190
Scalps. Dr. Lupo is he's good, right? Dr. Lupo is I believe a very seasoned player very good, right?

542
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:49,920
I feel like this is the one to watch at the moment

543
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:57,289
Sakuno's team is a is a powerhouse of content tarik got rebooted

544
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:08,750
But you can get in that thing

545
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,750
Yeah, you can like launch yourself

546
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:15,130
I didn't know you could gonzo the great out of that. I would have just done that

547
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,150
What would you call it gonzo the great?

548
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:27,960
Yeah, okay

549
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,239
Whoa, that's cool

550
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:31,610
It's inside the mind of sakuno right now

551
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,210
Dude dodger lupo's fortnight level 153

552
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:42,570
Oh shit

553
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,289
Guys, it's too late to get a vape pen. I can't do it right now

554
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:54,909
Yeah, blimps seem to be what everyone is trying to do

555
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,210
Yeah

556
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,809
I think we should avoid blimps

557
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:01,690
What's another good place to to hang out?

558
00:47:04,269 --> 00:47:07,469
I'm behind i'm not sure. I think it's just about like, uh

559
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:14,510
It's kind of lucky right because like you could say like oh drop far away, but then other teams are also saying drop far away

560
00:47:15,389 --> 00:47:20,670
We're really just trying to set ourselves up with like enough gear and decent positions so that we don't have to worry about looting

561
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,599
If we can just get live off the spawn

562
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,800
We can it'll help us a lot

563
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Yeah, just on's like just the most it's just coin

564
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,639
Yeah

565
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,599
Guys, i'm not gonna order a vape pen off of uber eats

566
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,130
That would be the stupidest fucking thing ever

567
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,800
uber eats

568
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:46,409
No, i'm not vaping a vape pet. I'm not gonna inhale nicotine for fun

569
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,949
The place is the very end but people who drop before the autodrop will just get there first

570
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,679
So if we want to go to the end, let's just drop before the end, you know

571
00:47:58,239 --> 00:47:59,800
Yeah

572
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,039
I mean like how much are you craving like nicotine where you need to uber eat?

573
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:12,639
Why is there a car over there? This is just like a there's just like a regular red sedan just parked on a hill

574
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,559
Yeah, there's just some car ass cars in this game and then there's like lambos with jet rockets

575
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,070
Wait, there are people

576
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:29,039
That was that was a good that was a good shot

577
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,599
Watching a tubbo right now

578
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:36,440
How do you switch teams? You're watching. Oh, you just keep pressing next. Yeah, he's gonna keep going

579
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:46,860
I'm trying to learn as I watch

580
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,179
All the teams are just like trying to get as high as possible

581
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,380
For one second. I thought that was like a cars crossover and there was a car's skin. That was like lightning mcqueen

582
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:58,059
the price that's oh, I just turned to a

583
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:06,920
Ooh ipn and it's chun li from street fighter with the dump truck tubbo is bruno mars

584
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:13,280
Shit

585
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,480
I bet epic could just make celebrity deathmatch with all the ip they own

586
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,800
Or like have access to licensing too. So this squad is all still up

587
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,980
which is the

588
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,179
Crash yawn disguise toast. Oh, no, somebody's dead

589
00:49:27,739 --> 00:49:29,739
Crashing just died. Oh, no, no questions right here

590
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,559
Yeah, uh the the health bar is like really bugged sometimes it'll just show people are dead when they're not

591
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,119
I feel like i'm stuck in between two teams

592
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,119
Yeah, i've had that happen to me. That's why I was asking like how do you switch teams?

593
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,280
But I just kept pressing next player and eventually I got out of the ken jutsu

594
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,360
I I don't I don't care about the flavored vape pens. I'm not gonna

595
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,679
Eat like inhale like apple cinnamon nicotine. No, I don't want to do that

596
00:49:55,239 --> 00:50:03,760
Is there a way to see the list of yo, guess what you shouldn't either

597
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,719
You shouldn't even know what that is

598
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,079
You shouldn't even know what that is. You're not old enough to know what that is. I'm playing fortnight today

599
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:20,760
Yeah, i'm stuck in the tier zoo team now

600
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,030
Yeah, I said that you're spectating me now. I'm just gonna i'm just gonna sit here

601
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,119
Enjoy the view while I can I hate being like trying to switch out

602
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:38,440
Oh my god, every team is trying so hard. Holy shit

603
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:47,579
This is great. The tier zoos team is just in bushes at the edge of the map the very very edge daily doses bad, man

604
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,599
So you kind of just want to grab you want to get a bunch of items get a spot

605
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,840
And just kind of defend that spot till the circle that starts to kind of encroach on you, right?

606
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,440
Yeah

607
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,880
you also kind of want to play to kill people though like I think I think like the way that the

608
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,840
the team like tier zoos team is playing whether there's play on the edge of the map like

609
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,519
Best case scenario they get to like the final couple teams and they're in like a pretty bad position

610
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,079
And then they like maybe they probably die

611
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,039
And you get points for every kill your team has. Oh, okay. So you do

612
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,719
So you get like a certain amount of points for like placing top three

613
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,440
But you every kill you get also adds on top of that. So like you do have some level of pressure to be aggressive

614
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,639
Okay, which is why being somewhat central and being high up is good because then you get to see people trying to rotate

615
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,239
Uh, but you're also in like a good spot looking at uh, justin minx's team looks like it's going down here

616
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,489
Uh-oh

617
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:46,409
Oh, this is trouble

618
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:48,409
This is a lot of trouble

619
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,400
Oh

620
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,360
Not quite

621
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,599
Oh thermal is so busted man

622
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,429
so this is uh

623
00:52:06,429 --> 00:52:09,440
I'm very invested

624
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,440
It's a good team right here. Who's anonymous 257. I want to know who that is. Yeah, I was wondering that too

625
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:19,239
Actually, we can look at this. Yeah, it's not it's not looking it's it's probably shra and actually, I don't know

626
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:26,829
That team is lily. It's lily

627
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:31,789
Is it lily? I don't hate fortnight. I just don't understand fortnight

628
00:52:45,449 --> 00:52:51,039
So how many squads are still up? Uh, well, there's 40 people

629
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:56,380
But it doesn't say the team amount there's a big fight going on with timmy's team

630
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:08,139
I feel like i'm playing against like professional soccer players in a game of football

631
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:12,199
And I like am a video gamer

632
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:21,369
Oh my god, it's like when one of those celebrity athletes comes to your school to visit, uh, and you're like an elementary school

633
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:26,969
And they're just like giant giant mountains of humans and you're like damn and then it's oh we're gonna play

634
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:31,130
We're gonna play some uh baseball together and they just hit like five home runs and everybody cheers

635
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:46,909
Well, they're reviving holy shit dude alec, uh

636
00:53:47,949 --> 00:53:50,429
My friend who got taken off our team his team is just destroyed

637
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,280
Happy for him. Um, I am happy for it was actually it's actually either you or him

638
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,760
What is going on over here, by the way?

639
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,610
It takes a long time to revive somebody does it?

640
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:07,210
Yeah, it takes 10 seconds, but you can double up you can like cut it in half if two people revive

641
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,369
Why was she just spray painting herself in the face

642
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:14,809
Uh, it's a heal. Oh, okay. Yeah, it heals you like 15 every like

643
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,170
Something every like half a second

644
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,730
That was oh

645
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:23,500
Who is that?

646
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:28,989
It's like the whole team

647
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:30,750
Who is prospering?

648
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,440
Oh, wow. I got puns puns is the only one on his team left. Oh, yeah, he is

649
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,250
Oh, he's right behind the team. This team doesn't see him

650
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:44,940
Somebody just said dude, why please tell me this is fake

651
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,869
My april fools joke was four days late. All right

652
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,170
Please tell me this is fake

653
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:01,369
I can assure you it's real but I can tell you it's a few days late

654
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,199
And I don't have the fake pen, but whatever

655
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,000
I'm just playing for it. I'm not kidding. I'm playing for it and i'm not kidding

656
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,360
I'm watching shroud and he's not he's not thirsting at all

657
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:22,090
He downs him and he moves on to the next chump. Yeah honorable gamer

658
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:25,880
It's xqc doing

659
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,199
He watched them to get revived so you can put them back down

660
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:33,239
Uh, he's like, please fucking rez. Oh, he's just better

661
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:41,559
Shit

662
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:44,110
Oh

663
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,550
Suc down

664
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,550
That was that was crazy

665
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:56,809
Tuber reaction. I gotta do something man was watching tv

666
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:05,150
Who's the shark who has the shark skin? It's just an actual shark in the game

667
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:08,570
It's like what the fuck is this?

668
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:14,010
Yeah, this game is terrible because they weren't doing anything I was like why are they not attacking this person

669
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:20,170
I thought it was like a transformation where he did like getting so oh my god. Yeah, dude

670
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:25,550
He's nuts

671
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:30,269
Dude, lovely wouldn't let our friend's little brother play because he's good at fortnight, but he let shroud in the tournament

672
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,429
Oh, like fucked up bro

673
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:36,829
Okay, he's down what shrouds is what shrouds name

674
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:40,349
Trouty rowdy rowdy. Oh my god. What can I not?

675
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:45,099
Oh, he just he literally just died. Oh, okay. The rest of his team is up

676
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:52,750
Huns is just big chilling. This is batman

677
00:56:54,030 --> 00:57:02,079
Oh nade shots down. Is this the end of the team? Oh, they're rezzing. They got nade up. He has a med kit

678
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:14,780
Uh, did they where stream 2022? You can't say that yet. It's not over. He chowed with his level one account

679
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,769
Just vibing. Oh, whoever they're fighting right now is just so dead

680
00:57:20,489 --> 00:57:30,590
What am I gonna add to make it better bro, I just told you we were doing tier lists after this

681
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,309
This is not gonna last that this is only gonna be like another like half hour 40 minutes

682
00:57:38,909 --> 00:57:41,789
Do you guys see puns? He's just been hiding. Yeah

683
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:52,429
That is so smart, I almost just call this guy han solo what's bubblefets in the game?

684
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:56,460
Yeah, I think so. I think they just yeah, they just saw her stuff

685
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:02,699
That's kind of cool. All right daily doses team. It's wiped. Wait puns can win this

686
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:08,940
Oh, he fucked up. Oh tarik's the only one left on this team, I think unless the health bars are glitched while these whole teams is up

687
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:15,929
Oh

688
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:25,789
They should rush they should rush the nade team

689
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,300
Wait, is it one v one? No

690
00:58:32,059 --> 00:58:35,960
I'm not gonna do a vape flavor tier list. I don't know what it even tastes like

691
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:42,360
It's probably probably tastes like ass. All right, so they're all going at f. They're like, oh my god. He like fifth partied

692
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,840
Oh, it's a four v one

693
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:48,780
Oh

694
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,179
What shot? Oh, that's toast toast to the last

695
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:56,110
Wait that oh, I was just on bubby's um pov and then I went right to do this when he headshot him

696
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:58,429
Anthony alex in the final team

697
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,510
That is crazy

698
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,579
Let's get evolved. Oh, that's

699
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,960
Okay, wow

700
00:59:12,139 --> 00:59:15,690
All right rough start but

701
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:20,429
I think frost was prospering guys pretty good. I think we'll be all right this time

702
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:28,349
With the last first one didn't count second one. We just got unlucky like everybody went there and I was still figuring out how to detach the parachute

703
00:59:28,989 --> 00:59:31,389
Um, I know how to do that. I know how to detach the parachute now

704
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:33,469
I think we're in a better position than we were before

705
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:38,269
We got it now. I'm optimistic. You know what they say jerma. You gotta be down to come back

706
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,010
Yeah

707
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:47,420
Also, you only ever win or learn that's a good way to put it. I learned so much

708
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:50,539
Just now watching that whole game the entire game

709
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,199
Is

710
00:59:55,159 --> 01:00:00,519
They're predicting a lot of strats I actually got the most perspective because I got to watch every player who wasn't me

711
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:10,110
Why is it headshotting everybody? Okay. Let's get this second code going

712
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,869
Oh, man

713
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:13,150
I have to leave

714
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:18,679
I'll be right back. Wait, what happened? How do I get out of here?

715
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:21,639
uh top left

716
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:25,800
Or escape key maybe and then oh just bottom left is maybe a cancel bottom left. Yeah

717
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:32,079
Someone said we're not last which is kind of hype

718
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,889
No, we are we finished 19th. There's 19 teams. I'm banning that guy

719
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:46,539
Easy, so there's 19 teams. We came in 19th place. Yeah, I think we we got well, we got really unlucky. We really did

720
01:00:48,139 --> 01:00:52,860
It's not over. I wish there was still five matches but

721
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,500
People in my chat are voting to see if we're gonna win the next round

722
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:02,489
um

723
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:06,090
It's not a it's not a uh straight bet. What would you say they go?

724
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:10,250
What if you were taking odds on this? What's the odds that we come in first place next next game?

725
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,929
one in 19

726
01:01:11,929 --> 01:01:13,929
No

727
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:15,449
19

728
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:17,449
I think it's 100 percent

729
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:21,849
Yeah, 100 percent. I'm on the 100 percent. We're winning this one. We got unlucky like

730
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:24,489
Yeah, I think the payout would be like

731
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,949
6000 to one

732
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:29,949
If you would have bet on us right now

733
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:33,690
Are the odds that's hype. Yeah, somebody could make a lot of money

734
01:01:33,929 --> 01:01:46,760
I just feel like the results of the last match were indicative of our team's overall skill. Mm-hmm or

735
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,300
Connectiveness or

736
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,880
Chemistry. Yeah, I think I think I think we should stay away from blimps because blimps are a little confusing

737
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,880
They're like genuinely confusing to navigate on the inside and get to and get up and down and we can just go to like

738
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:02,699
Just some town and loot up, you know

739
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:06,059
Also want to make sure I get because I don't want to be a moron when we start this

740
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,489
If one of you guys goes down

741
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:13,210
Is is it you know you get to a position where you can like a left for dead revive somebody, right?

742
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:16,250
Just like e hold e tap. Yeah, you hold it. You hold it. Okay

743
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:20,730
Yeah, and you can't you can't move around like physically while doing it. You have to just stay still

744
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:37,530
Okay, you're kind of using your your positional currency by rising. This is cool regardless

745
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:45,849
No, it's only cool if we win. I was gonna wait till we won and then we could

746
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:49,849
Say this is only fun because we won

747
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,440
Not now

748
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:08,059
It's just unlucky we got

749
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:13,019
Doing the we two teams that are like really really really good teams that have really good players

750
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:15,179
We ran into them back to back first second

751
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:21,019
It is crazy that we fought tarik's team and then we got a lucky reset and then we fought xqc's team

752
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:27,179
Yeah, I know right. I killed I killed someone on that blimp. I killed I don't know who they were like that's some weird name

753
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:30,730
I think it might have been

754
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:34,880
ipn

755
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,440
I wish I would have landed on the blimp dude if we would have killed that team

756
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:43,070
Um, it's so nice. Fuck the stream's not over yet

757
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:47,599
Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait for those worst dream 2022 andes

758
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:54,800
To wait till I do the full from software every single boss ever tier list because that's coming up and I want I want to

759
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,679
See your face when you see how fun that is

760
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:12,110
But I get cool backpacks i'm gonna buy something right now. You got me inspired hot bullet time is so swag

761
01:04:12,989 --> 01:04:21,309
I'm i'm very confident. We'll at least

762
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:24,030
We will at least land this time

763
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:26,670
And at least congregate somewhere with weapons

764
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:39,659
Desert get you a rifle in your hand. I have fish sticks in the oven. Um

765
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:44,559
Man, let me ask you guys this in the call here. Yeah, so

766
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,300
You know how in the back of a lot of frozen foods?

767
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,210
it's like

768
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:55,289
50 plus minutes sometimes to heat up but it's like four minutes in the microwave

769
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,039
Yeah, how?

770
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,039
When do you guys decide to use the oven?

771
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:08,570
Can I tell you my my filthy little secret my my filthy little dirty secret I have sure

772
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:11,309
uh

773
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:19,449
I prefer microwaved food totally oven-made food. Yeah. Yeah, you're just like you're just like a sludge monster

774
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:22,889
It's because it's fast just because it's faster and you know, you can for me for me for me

775
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:27,289
It's because it's faster like I know no for me. It is taste. That's why I am a filthy monster

776
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,750
I actually think that how do I put this?

777
01:05:31,579 --> 01:05:34,860
You know how like you know shit that you put in the oven in microwave

778
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:37,820
It's already like a certain quality threshold that it can't break through

779
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:44,960
Like it has a hard ceiling of how good it can be also game two's in the thing

780
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:50,010
I have the code in there and we're ready. We're ready. Yeah. Awesome

781
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:55,530
What's the last thing you guys ate that was a like a microwaved food or a frozen food?

782
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:57,289
Uh

783
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:03,690
Microwaving I I do microwave leftovers all the time. That's just simple. No, but like a packaged like disgusting trash meal

784
01:06:03,769 --> 01:06:06,030
I had a uh

785
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:12,570
I had a di giorno pizza on my trip to arizona a couple weeks ago brotherhood. Yeah, that's all right

786
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:15,199
No, but I mean I I wouldn't put that in the microwave

787
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:21,679
I would never put would you ever put a chicken pot pie in the microwave? Yeah. Oh, come on. I used to eat those

788
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:23,679
That's why i'm only this tall

789
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:32,889
It's stunted your growth the frozen chicken pot pie has to go in the oven even it takes like an hour it has to

790
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,050
Yeah, maybe for you. I guess yeah

791
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:39,130
Maybe if you maybe you're free from the 50s and you and you hand crank your radio

792
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:42,409
Can you do it in black and white? Yeah, i'm fucking busy brother

793
01:06:44,329 --> 01:06:47,610
All right, so what everyone what would you put it up? Oh god damn. I'm such a driver ready

794
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:50,489
It's always talking about chicken pot pies

795
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:53,130
Is that why they came somebody said they came to watch you stream?

796
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:59,179
We're just sitting here talking about frozen food and I didn't ready up yet. Sorry about the banter

797
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:06,329
Savnet, what's the last frozen food thing you ate? Dude, I actually don't remember you live healthy. Yeah, you're eating good

798
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:10,650
That's really good though. Let's be honest. I I have yeah, I I try to eat pretty good

799
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:14,250
Yeah, I don't I don't remember the last frozen food thing, but yeah, I really don't

800
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:18,250
I used to grind final fantasy 14 and just eat pop tarts all day in college

801
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:24,650
I think I just like 2 000 calories a day in pop tarts again. It's why my bones i'm sure are hollow like a bird's

802
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:32,960
I remember my first year of college. I'd yeah, I used to eat so much like yeah pop tarts and like

803
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,079
What's it called hot pockets and that type of stuff? I'd tear it up

804
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:46,860
You know what actually is good in the microwave is those trader joe's, uh tiki masalas those are unbelievable trader joe's

805
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,679
Constantly is blowing me away. That actually might be the best frozen food item that exists

806
01:07:53,159 --> 01:08:04,409
Is the tiki masala from trader joe's like honest to god? It's it's there's nothing that compares frozen wise germa

807
01:08:04,409 --> 01:08:08,889
Who is your best friend? Um

808
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:21,760
Uh burger boy. Wait, what was that burger boy? Are we getting owned burger boy these nuts in your mouth?

I try to get ahead of it

812
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:32,960
Oh burger boy. Look, I don't have a best friend because I think that that's stupid because it called it

813
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,039
All of your other

814
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:37,760
All of your other friends then have to know oh that's your best friend

815

No, I have everyone's on the same playing field for me dibs. Well, we're not we're not there yet

816
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:52,800
You can't a centrist. How is that a centrist?

817
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,880
It's a centrist position. Yeah, that person is correct

818
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:06,779
No, they are not because I don't have a best friend makes me a centrist. Yeah. Yes, sir. Mr. President, sir

819
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,680

821
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:23,279
That's fair like my with my group of like friends that i'm like really close with i'd probably be like dream george

822
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,760
carl quackety

823
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:31,199
It's a circle rather than like yeah, it's like a circle. It's not like yeah, you are incredibly well rounded

824
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,199
Can I just say like you're right?

825
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,920
You've got like you have a good standing with friends. Yeah

826
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:40,399
You are very well rounded you go for the blimp. You know when to knock over the blimp

827
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:44,640
I'm gonna need you to start pointing out some flaws if you're gonna gel with this team

828
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:54,539
Well, let me guess you care too much you work too hard. Yeah, I guess i'm just too goated show up early

829
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:58,060
No, okay. I'm really bad. I i'm bad showing up on time

830
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:04,460
So what's what's the plan here guys? What are we doing? All right, we're in the game and I think you guys want to crank it shifty shafts

831
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,850
Let's do it wherever you guys want to go wherever you guys want to go. I think shifty shafts is good

832
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:14,810
Um, I think if there's a lot of people we stay together. We stay together like a tight unit

833
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:19,930
Yeah, yeah exactly we we crank it to the lumber yards. There's like a million people here

834
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:23,069
sounds good

835
01:10:23,069 --> 01:10:35,930
It's like a team

836
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,880
Yeah, like a team they're dropping before we pivot

837
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,199
You guys want to pivot?

838
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:47,520
I'm too close to pivot. I can't get it anymore. All right. All right, we're sticking to it stick to it, baby

839
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,159

Holy shit, i'm gonna lose my fucking mind. I swear

01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,399
We gotta pick a spot on the map. That's like in the ocean

855
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:09,720
We are going so fucking far away. We just want to I just want to at least stream the game for five minutes

856
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,819
Dude shroud is just tearing everyone up. I'm sorry. Oh my god

860
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:30,699

01:12:59,069 --> 01:13:01,069
This is unreal

867
01:13:01,069 --> 01:13:03,069
No, this is

868
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:07,340
Hey

869
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:12,779
No, we we've landed three separate spots. We've ran into shroud twice and xqc's came the other time

870
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:23,100
Hey, good luck game three guys. Good luck game three

871
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:31,130
I just want to hold a weapon to watch the whole fucking game again. Oh my god, dude

872
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:34,439
I just I just want to know what it's like to shoot a weapon

873
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,199
I know

874
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:42,119
No, I I knew because like I ran downstairs like like in the mines and I was like destroying someone and I got

875
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:45,560
Two tapped by a deag and I was like damn whoever two tapped me with that deag is really good

876
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:48,600
And then I saw the fucking kill feed and I was like god damn it

877
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,199
Bro, okay. Now you can nominate for worst room

878
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:56,560
um

879
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,439
After that one because it'd be like what am I supposed to do about it?

880
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,430
What am I supposed to do?

881
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:09,069
Is that oh I land we land and which is dead. I I haven't even held a weapon yet

882
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:11,069
I don't even know what this is like

883
01:14:11,069 --> 01:14:14,350
I don't know what the trajectory of moving your character feels like

884
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:18,600
Like I don't know what the the knots per second it is when you actually walk around

885
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,479
I don't think i've walked around. I think i've landed with the parachute

886
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:24,359
And died in five to ten seconds

887
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:28,109
Oh my god

888
01:14:28,109 --> 01:14:32,750
I mean, it's funny, but I mean, I was just sure a lot of content going on for me

889
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,840
You know you want to come over zap nap

890
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,880
He's earned it honestly

891
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:46,199
He's had too good for too long

892
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,680
Yeah, I said I think i'm gonna surprise some people if I had a

893
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,319
I have had fucking minecraft axe in my hand

894
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,880
And i'm I don't know what like all these places are I haven't even held a weapon yet

895
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:04,000
If you put a weapon in my hand

896
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,880
But I like I was about to I was about to walk around the corner and melee swing at shroud

897
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:14,239
Do you understand like what out dire it is right now on this team? We just keep I

898
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:21,229
He would have thought I was a bot. He would have thought I was about this is path

899
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,590
So what if

900
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:31,550
Sorry, okay. What if we if there's a team we just fucking go away like we don't take the initial flight ever

901
01:15:31,789 --> 01:15:34,590
Yeah, we loot first. We loot first no matter what even if we think the team's bad

902
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:42,640
So it's like if we see a team, uh, you know, we just mark a different spot overshoot or something like that

903
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:45,680
I think that's our best chance to get out of the yeah

904
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:50,319
Maybe we even maybe we even drop really high so that we have advantage on like where people are going

905
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:53,039
We can decide

906
01:15:53,039 --> 01:16:01,500
We would we don't we don't need to hit the ground first if we're going somewhere. No one went

907
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:06,029
Oh, no daily dose

908
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:07,819
I love that guy

909
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:12,539
He's hiding he's trying not to die I hate that guy but I like his content so I should have done

910
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:15,390
You hate him because he's

911
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:18,590
Seating the game looks like he's trying to get him water. He's like water, please

912
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:22,699
I feel like he's gonna put his head in there and start shrinking

913
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:29,210

01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:47,039
Stream title is just playing fortnight. I'm not kidding

977
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,720
Who?

978
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,319
germa

979
01:22:50,399 --> 01:23:00,380
Oh this guy's a leather banana

980
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:34,989
I don't like that. I don't like even it being called that sexual you play you play minecraft, right tap nap

981
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,460
Yeah

982
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:39,899
Do you do you still enjoy it these days as much as you used to when you got into it?

983
01:23:40,659 --> 01:23:46,819
Um, I think now these days it's i'm much more relying on like I need to be playing with like my friends before

984
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:54,159
I used to like sweat minecraft. I was just playing just to be like good. So now it's more social

985
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,079
Yeah, it's like if your friends don't want to play you're probably not playing. Yeah, exactly

986
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,619
Oh shit, that's why I don't play csgo. We're the same. Oh god. I played so much csgo

987
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:09,569
All my friends switched to valorant and I was like, I can't I guess i'm playing valorant now, which is fine

988
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:13,260
But I missed the ak-47

989
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:17,949
Yeah, I just miss cracking cases. Honestly, that's

990
01:24:18,909 --> 01:24:23,390
If they would just put opening cases in valorant, I would I would have nothing left in counter-strike. I'm in

991
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:29,170
Okay, i'm back. I just I like counter-strike's movement got a little trick for you here

992
01:24:29,329 --> 01:24:34,500
You'd like to see it feels like a little clunky, but valorant. I actually enjoy valorant more

993
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:42,720
Like just a quick one. Yeah, I I agree with that. I think uh, pretty much like I think that I like that counter-strike

994
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:49,920
Rewards you for being good at b-hopping. My hands are so greasy instead of making b-hopping and like not a thing. Yeah

995
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,800
I also think that they made a counter-strafing

996
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:57,789
Not a thing. So yeah counter-strafing is like it's like bad like you can't there's no

997
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:01,250
there's no jiggle peeking right i'm like in csgo like

998
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:03,890
like you can jiggle peek a corner and just like

999
01:25:04,289 --> 01:25:06,770
tap heads and valorant it's not as

1000
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:13,329
Yeah, and valorant you can just let go of the movement key and it you're accurate the same speed as if you counter-strike

1001
01:25:13,329 --> 01:25:17,729
Yeah, when I jiggle in valorant, I feel like i'm getting made fun of like in a discord or somewhere

1002
01:25:19,539 --> 01:25:23,220
Look at this guy. What is what is what do you think he's doing? He's playing the wrong game

1003
01:25:26,529 --> 01:25:33,810
You play valorant a lot slap sap amp. Yeah, I do. What's your rank diamond three diamond? Oh, he's a gamer

1004
01:25:34,289 --> 01:25:37,899
Yes, sir. Me too. I'm also that i'm actually immortal

1005
01:25:38,439 --> 01:25:39,739
20 20

1006
01:25:39,819 --> 01:25:45,949
26 we should play I think I think I was d3 at the end of the season and I think i'm d2 right now

1007
01:25:45,949 --> 01:25:49,710
I haven't played much. I haven't been home for like the whole entire last month

1008
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:53,789
We can get our we can get our ego up after this play some valorant. Yeah

1009
01:25:54,829 --> 01:25:56,189
All right, guys

1010
01:25:56,189 --> 01:26:01,470
That's a game I win at I'd like for you guys to make it just a quick quick u-turn over to my stream for a second

1011
01:26:01,869 --> 01:26:05,550
Yeah, I knew that get it open. It's cracking. Let's see

1012
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:12,619
I'd like to show you I've got two hands here holding a penny you can see

1013
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,319
This hand is nothing in it. Let's just go and make sure there's no strings there

1014
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,859
No strings. Yeah, i'm on i'm on you i'm on no strings at all

1015
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:25,170
And if we could turn that penny be nice if we could turn that into 50 cents, wouldn't it?

1016
01:26:25,569 --> 01:26:32,270
That'd be pretty cool. You know turn that into 50 cents, wouldn't it? Oh shit

1017
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:34,750
That's kind of clean

1018
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:38,510
50x yeah, that's a 50x 50x on on

1019
01:26:40,029 --> 01:26:42,029
Whoa on might of raw

1020
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:50,619
My stream sucks

1021
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:57,340
Yeah, no, I I know a little bit of magic why you stream you could just do that like a hundred more times and

1022
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:02,930
You'd be set. It's exponential if it keeps doubling. Would you like to know how to do it?

1023
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:06,449
Would you let me to do the thing where the guy doesn't have the whole tv show about all the magic

1024
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,529
The masked magician. Yeah, that show is so awesome

1025
01:27:11,229 --> 01:27:16,350
You know magicians were pissed about that. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that guy was in like a lot of trouble

1026
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:20,050
What

1027
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:24,630
Is he like I like I like how they did shit. I like the idea of like a large group of magicians

1028
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:32,670
I'm going to make your wife disappear

1029
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:36,270
So if you guys want to like, you know

1030
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:40,829
Impress your friends and stuff you you have to open with like the fun line of gosh man

1031
01:27:40,829 --> 01:27:42,500
That's stock market

1032
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:46,819
Don't you wish you could die, you know buy buy a stock or security and have it go up by 50x

1033
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:51,939
Like you start with that like, you know corny shit and then they go. Whoa, they lean in they get really curious

1034
01:27:52,699 --> 01:27:57,220
And then what you say is you say i've got a penny here and what you've got you do have a penny

1035
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:01,170
But what you also have is you hold the two quarters here as well. The two quarters sit

1036
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:05,409
Uh, is that perpendicular? What is that? Oh, I see. Yeah perpendicular. Oh, that's correct

1037
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:11,729
So you make the ad it blocks everything especially it's like how could you even hold those quarters there show them the other hand

1038
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:16,609
And then and then and then say excuse me you you in the audience. Excuse me

1039
01:28:19,489 --> 01:28:23,409
Would you would you like to buy one cent in my my new stock here and then they go

1040
01:28:23,729 --> 01:28:26,770
Of course, I will in this context really quick just so I can clarify i'm trying to learn

1041
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:32,180
Um, so you're already on stage as a magician. Yes got it

1042
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,850
Okay

1043
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:45,170
Okay, so what we do is you take your thumb raise the bottom of the penny slide it underneath the second quarter grip

1044
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:51,840
Hole with the other hand hide it behind the quarter. Oh, let's slide a hand

1045
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:00,239
Yeah, no, that that's how you do it. Why do you ever do the thing where you uh, you put the salt shaker under the napkin

1046
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,560
And you smash it

1047
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,180
Uh, yeah, you like slide it off the table first and then you like smash it. Yeah, that's a good one

1048
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:15,600
That's that's a that's a wow. That's a wild classic. Okay, so let's try to uh, pick a weapon up this time

1049
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:20,159
Yeah, let's try to like survive longer than two minutes. Yes

1050
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:28,930
I feel good about this game. Actually you take two turns like your your pokemon like rests for two turns

1051
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:35,630
Then it comes out with like a really big attack. Yeah, we got we're winning this next game. Fuck it

1052
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:38,109
I don't care speak it into the world bro. I'm with you

1053
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:48,289
Okay, you want to hear the the prediction that's running over here? What's that is will I pick up a gun before I die?

1054
01:29:49,970 --> 01:29:53,409
And honestly like those odds are not great if you really think about

1055
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:58,609
Yeah, if you're looking at statistics purely then the odds are not in your favor yet gambler fallacy, bro

1056
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:01,729
It's not like it's going to influence the next event, you know

1057
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:12,909
Think about that temple sapper. Honestly, I have two chap sticks

1058
01:30:12,989 --> 01:30:23,859
Um two different flavors play one game of fortnight with sap now. I got minecrafters following me. What happened to my skin?

1059
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:29,539
I had a skin that I was happy. It made me look like a sweat and now I can't find it anywhere. I found it

1060
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:32,909
Look, oh yeah, we're gonna be scared of us. That's yeah

1061
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:37,460
Maybe we should all change skins because we sort of train people to think that we're easy

1062
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:43,060
Yeah, they see they see like the the the blintz yaga and they're like, ah, really? That's all these fuckers

1063
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:49,899
We're gonna ride guys. Can they see my level? Uh, I don't think they can when they spectate you

1064
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,600
Yeah, all right, but not in the game. They don't go look level one get them

1065
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:57,039
I don't think a single person has been able to spectate you yet, though

1066
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:04,029
Any of us that is true. I didn't think about that. There's just nothing to watch for any of us. All right

1067
01:31:04,029 --> 01:31:07,949
I got my sweat costume. Oh, it's probably like, you know, where are these guys? What are they?

1068
01:31:09,069 --> 01:31:14,159
Are they even here? Do they go home? Yeah. Yeah, that's it. It's true

1069
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:25,329
What you see lewis announcement? Wait, what do you do winning team?

1070
01:31:25,489 --> 01:31:29,659
All gets a $1,000 massage chair delivered to their home. All right guys, come on

1071
01:31:29,659 --> 01:31:32,220
We gotta quit fucking around now if we win the rest of them. We have a chance

1072
01:31:32,859 --> 01:31:36,880
It's true. We have two more matches. We have three, right?

1073
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:41,760
No, they got rid of the fifth one. So we have to the time. Yeah. Oh my god. I know

1074
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:44,640
Even if we win the next year, I don't even think we could win

1075
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:50,289
We have to kill like the half the server. I wouldn't put it past us though. We have that

1076
01:31:50,689 --> 01:31:58,189
And I think we do have it we've actually gotten kind of it's been a little it's been a little rough where we've landed

1077
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,109
Yeah, what the fuck? I'm so mad. I can't believe it. I can't wait to be diving

1078
01:32:04,939 --> 01:32:08,619
Look over and diving right next to me at the exact same speed as shroud

1079
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:13,380
He just winks at you and just like oh, oh

1080
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:20,319
Okay, if that happens, i'm just telling you guys i'm gonna pop parachute and i'm just going i'm just floating him to somewhere else

1081
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:24,130
He's abandoning us mr president goes to the fallout shelter

1082
01:32:24,449 --> 01:32:37,359
I know I know shroud's skin now so I can determine if it's him. I think i'll actually beat that prediction though

1083
01:32:37,359 --> 01:32:39,359
I think i'll get a gun before dying this time

1084
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:45,409
We have such a cool squad too. We could do so much fun

1085
01:32:45,409 --> 01:32:49,970
We could get in the car we could go jump around the buildings and stuff like come on we have this is such a cool squad

1086
01:32:50,609 --> 01:32:55,489
That's what i'm saying. I'm trying to have a goddamn wonder years episode with my boys

1087
01:32:56,930 --> 01:33:01,659
I never finished that show. I need to finish that

1088
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:06,829
I remember was on netflix and I grinded it. I was

1089
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:13,100
Why was that show so good

1090
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:21,180
It's a really good question. I seemingly I like I remember it being like insanely good when I was watching it

1091
01:33:21,579 --> 01:33:23,100
Wait, what show?

1092
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:24,300
Wonder years

1093
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:33,100
It was a good show. Is it just is coming of age american coming of age just like hit the sweet spot in our brains

1094
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:41,170
Maybe well that show was um, his brother had a mullet. That was how long was that show on the air?

1095
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:46,050
I feel like it was on for a really long time. All right, we got the game three code

1096
01:33:46,289 --> 01:33:48,850
All right, let's get involved

1097
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:51,539

1100
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,199
My boss are i'm just gonna buy one with the company card

1101
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:22,880
Even if we lose I don't give a shit. I'm charging ludwig's card a thousand dollars for a massage chair

1102
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:28,079
Regardless if we drop next to shroud this match, I am buying a massage chair on company dime

1103
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,770
In between the match

1104
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:37,250
We put it on the podcast next week. We call it a business expense. This is this is mogul moves

1105
01:34:37,489 --> 01:34:42,750

1106
01:34:44,029 --> 01:34:46,029
Yeah, my bad. Oh shit

1107
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:49,380
That would be for you three. I don't deserve one

1108
01:34:50,449 --> 01:34:56,140
No, you deserve one. No, you deserve one. What the hell get that mentality up. I don't want to hear that

1109
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:02,560
Yeah, come on it doesn't matter because we're just gonna win it anyways, but like on the off chance we don't

1110
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:08,979
Right. Yeah, even if we do win i'm buying a second one to let him know that his tournament was bad

1111
01:35:09,699 --> 01:35:13,600
Nick myth is in our house fishing for compliments. Somebody said

We are gonna be golden. We're gonna it's gonna be awesome

1116
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,420
You sound like you're about to go on the stage for the talent show

01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,989
To do my magic tricks. I feel so good right now. We're gonna be electric. I got the coin trick

1118
01:35:51,229 --> 01:35:53,550
The crowd can't even see the types of coins you're holding

1119
01:35:54,750 --> 01:36:07,340
So far away, what is that? My go-to magic trick was uh, that one from you guys you ever see now you see me

1120
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:09,180
Yes

1121
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:13,020
There's the intro scene where he like flips the deck of cards and he's like did you see that card and he pulls it

1122
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:15,899
Out and the one the audience all saw that was my go-to

1123
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:23,439
I my brain can't even remember half that movie. My that movie is just a trailer of people like throwing cards at each other

1124
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:26,770
That that's not you see me too

1125
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:35,170
Oh, what's the one where they robbed the they robbed the bank? That's the first one. That's the first one. That was pretty cool

1126
01:36:39,329 --> 01:36:41,649
When somebody was like the eye or something, right?

1127
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,869
Uh, there's like something like

1128

01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:05,390

1132
01:37:05,789 --> 01:37:07,789
My guess is

1133
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:11,789
2013 maybe 2012. That's a good guess

1134
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:16,500
See now you see me

1135
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:21,039
2013 on the dot. Let's fucking go nice. Nice job

1139
01:37:40,670 --> 01:37:49,789
Yeah, one probably put him like a jail cell at one point. It's kind of crazy. It was a good watch. Yeah

I think I think we're we're pretty mentally beaten, you know, so we gotta

1214
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:15,329
It's it's very fair to feel good to actually like run around and shit. Holy fuck seriously

1215
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:17,970
Yeah, I didn't know this game had controls

1216
01:43:18,529 --> 01:43:23,460
I gotta do this before we'd all right. Oh my god. We're far away from that. Aren't we pretty far?

1217
01:43:23,619 --> 01:43:25,619
Let's just start cranking it that way

1218
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:37,199
You're pretty far nick. Yeah, i'm coming. Is there a reason why batman is on the screen right now blinking?

1219
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:43,949
Yeah, that's like it's about if we kill him on the map. There's a yellow circle. That's where he is

1220
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:48,029
Shock grenades are big that cars us that's nick. Yep

1221
01:43:50,859 --> 01:43:52,859
All right. We picked a good place to drop this time

1222
01:43:55,439 --> 01:44:00,319
All right, my loot pretty trash. Yeah, I got I got I got some minis up here someone wants to grab those. I have no space

1223
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:06,260
We need to get like a keg would be really nice so we can all get up to 100 shield. I can splash us

1224
01:44:06,819 --> 01:44:08,819
All right, let's meet up in this house. Let's splash

1225
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:12,579
Okay, there's no there's a blimp here. So be careful that there might be people on it

1226
01:44:13,539 --> 01:44:18,159
Let's see

1227
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:20,000
The car

1228
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,640
Here, what's splash up right here? I don't see anybody in the blimp

1229
01:44:23,279 --> 01:44:30,239
So is a smart thing to do just to yell out the number at the top of the screen

1230
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:38,239
Yeah, that's pretty good. There's also 319. That works like like when when people shoot there's a red little uh thing that pops up on it

1231
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:41,789
Wait, you say there's people 319

1232
01:44:41,789 --> 01:44:44,590
No, no, no, that was a dummy call out. Yeah, okay

1233
01:44:47,619 --> 01:44:50,819
Did no one go to this blimp? I'm kind of scared to go to this blimp and loot it

1234
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:55,680
But this town looks unlooted below it. Yeah, we also don't have a lot of time

1235
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:59,180
Yeah, but we can you we can use that we should go to the bump

1236
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:06,659
What's with the bump because we can use the blimp to fly to your own frames. Oh

1237
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:13,500
Uh, anyone have can you hold smalls? Uh sound up you hold small pots. I got I got six already

1238
01:45:15,579 --> 01:45:17,340
Actually, I can eat the big

1239
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:20,060
Yeah, I could I would eat it. Never mind. I'll hold it. I got it

1240
01:45:20,699 --> 01:45:24,220
Dude, there's so much loot in this town. We should just yeah, let's loot loot this town and then use wait

1241
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:29,819
This chest is open. This chest is open. Yep. That's true. Could be team here. I'm going over here

1242
01:45:30,619 --> 01:45:32,640
Going on the blimp

1243
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:35,600
I'm gonna go with you. I'm not gonna i'm kind of scared to go in it

1244
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:39,680
Maybe i'll take a little gandy. Yeah, this is looted. I'm just gonna stay on top of the blimp

1245
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
i'm actually use use the blimp to

1246
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:43,439
Glide out

1247
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:44,880
That's a call

1248
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,800
We all had enough. Yep. Yeah, and then we're just gonna fly away using the like the propeller things

1249
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:52,979
I bet the team that was here already left. Yeah, I think they did as well

1250
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I think we should just be

1251
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,819
Pussies and just stay like on the edge of the zone. Yeah. Oh shit. We gotta go now. Oh my god

1252
01:46:00,819 --> 01:46:08,619
It's coming out. It's not gonna hurt too bad. But yeah, i'm already in right on you

1253
01:46:08,939 --> 01:46:13,470
Okay, there's a blimp right here probably guaranteed a team on it. So stay away from that

1254
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:16,590
There's some people in there. We should stay away from tilted in general. That's gonna be fucking

1255
01:46:17,229 --> 01:46:18,510
terrible

1256
01:46:18,510 --> 01:46:20,430
We should just keep looting these outer

1257
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:22,430
Little things like this little hut and shit

1258
01:46:23,069 --> 01:46:31,500
There's still 60 people alive, bro. There's a green og in here. Just pretty nice on one set. I will need that

1259
01:46:32,979 --> 01:46:35,380
Did I heal a little bit or should I take this big?

1260
01:46:36,029 --> 01:46:41,500
Yep, when you when we get safe you can heal up but you shouldn't really need to because you can't heal with a bandage

1261
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,359
And it's a waste of a medkit

1262
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:46,880
Uh, there's mushrooms over here on my ping if you want to get your shield finish off

1263
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:54,270
Okay, so the teams that are in tilted are gonna start moving towards us because of the next circle

1264
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:56,989
So we should probably run like completely out of here. It's like let's go this way

1265
01:46:57,550 --> 01:47:02,189
Oh, there's a team people fighting in front of us. There's a fucking tank. Oh, it's a battle bus. Oh shit

1266
01:47:03,149 --> 01:47:06,590
Yeah, we should stay the fuck away from that. I do have a rocket. I have three purple rockets

1267
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,789
No, we shouldn't fight on a thing give away in the I can kill one

1268
01:47:11,649 --> 01:47:15,569
Not nice. Nice. Good job. Finish up. Nice. We gotta kill

1269
01:47:20,579 --> 01:47:22,579
I didn't see anything. I was spraying myself in the face

1270
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:24,260
No, that's

1271
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:27,779
You're doing your job. You're you're using less that player made a call out where we are

1272
01:47:27,779 --> 01:47:31,359
So we should probably reposition. Yep

1273
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:36,399
Do you think the rest of the teams right they're either right up here? I see over here. Wait, a car just turned on right next to me

1274
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:40,479
Guy but jumping. Okay, I think we're getting run up on and done up on

1275
01:47:41,819 --> 01:47:43,819
Careful. Oh shit. I'm getting hit

1276
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:48,130
This guy right here in front of me

1277
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:51,649
Chilling i'm coming to you. I'm gonna come to you. I'm gonna fight with you. I'm backing up here

1278
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:54,369
Yep, I don't really like maybe we just go back where we came from

1279
01:47:58,510 --> 01:48:00,510
Oh right right fire

1280
01:48:00,829 --> 01:48:03,939
Covering fire. Ah

1281
01:48:03,939 --> 01:48:08,739
Right there on my ping. He's he's coming behind us. He's flanking that tree. No, no, no, no, no

1282
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:11,460
On us on us on us

1283
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:15,699
God I don't I don't even I have a stay alive. Stay alive. Stay alive

1284
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:21,380
I want you to I want you to stay all the way to the end, baby. Ah, that was excuse me

1285
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:25,949
Okay, of course

1286
01:48:25,949 --> 01:48:26,750
Oh

1287
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:33,680
Don't even engage to stay alive get get us towards the end. There's we have I think we have so many meds on

1288
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:38,479
We have so many meds on us that you can stay in the oh shit. There's a guy right there

1289
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:43,760
What I need is pause pause my fucking spotify

1290
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:48,430
You're like the little brother that their mother forced them to play with their older brother

1291
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:55,300
I mean, yeah, this is the first okay. I don't even know what the weapons distances are

1292
01:48:59,869 --> 01:49:01,869
It's fun, but

1293
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:07,119
Because they're gonna dip right now and then you have a bunch of heels

1294
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:13,659
I hope these okay as long as they didn't take them all turn the shadow with shadows off help

1295
01:49:13,979 --> 01:49:21,869
I don't why why am I dropping frames? That's fucking annoying then with this tree

1296
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:30,449
Hey, all you gotta do stay alive simple enough. All right storm coming in

1297
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:45,390
There's no fucking heels. Holy shit

1298
01:49:46,609 --> 01:49:48,449
Hold on. Okay

1299
01:49:48,449 --> 01:49:51,170
Yes, oh so swag that was the most swag thing i've ever seen

1300
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:56,180
Holy shit, that was pretty cool

1301
01:49:56,180 --> 01:50:00,829
You got a great circle

1302
01:50:00,829 --> 01:50:03,229
Dude, holy shit. If you actually get those rezzes off

1303
01:50:03,869 --> 01:50:05,789
This is doable

1304
01:50:05,789 --> 01:50:09,869
I don't know the only fuck the only one is there it's gonna be tough reboot van

1305
01:50:13,779 --> 01:50:17,460
Yeah, when you die, you drop a little card and you go to the van and you can redeploy us

1306
01:50:18,699 --> 01:50:20,699
But you got to collect the card which he just did

1307
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:27,010
Yeah, the frames are dropping because I went back to the original ingest server a week ago and now it's having problems again

1308
01:50:27,649 --> 01:50:33,069
Hooray, that's fucking fantastic. So i'm just gonna go to the other one and never turn back

1309
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:40,020
You gotta be worried about getting fucking sniped from someone. There's so many players. Like they have one like has to be near you

1310
01:50:40,779 --> 01:50:48,939
Yeah, I know. Hopefully I can catch someone coming into the circle or something

1311
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:52,699
So if you get to that van you can revive everybody

1312
01:50:53,899 --> 01:50:55,899
Yeah, wait, can I get in that battle bus?

1313
01:50:56,380 --> 01:51:05,779
That's a player. You saw one. Yeah. Yeah, hopefully the bus is probably out of gas if it's just sitting there

1314
01:51:10,369 --> 01:51:17,119
Oh, I can maybe steal some kills here. Oh nice. Yes, sir

1315
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:22,560
That's x bro

1316
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:27,149
The party bus

1317
01:51:27,789 --> 01:51:34,260
Oh shit i'm on fire with yes, sir

1318
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:38,340
That was that was ridiculous. What just happened?

1319
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:41,140
Someone blew it up with I think a rocket

1320
01:51:41,619 --> 01:51:44,979
X is probably still downed on that. Uh, Ron. No, no his friends are picking him up for sure

1321
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:50,590
Yep, I didn't want to check do this. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, I think you're in a good spot

1322
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:53,550
Oh

1323
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:59,949
How do you see me there that's crazy way better way better this time boys

1324
01:52:01,869 --> 01:52:02,750
Wow

1325
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:05,949
All right, i'm reporting him

1326
01:52:06,829 --> 01:52:08,829
That's really the only option. Yeah

1327
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:14,289
Dude, oh my xqc shroud xqc shroud delta was or no xqc shroud shot xqc

1328
01:52:15,149 --> 01:52:19,550
Yeah, I guess he knew maybe he just knew from where I shot him last time. He was just waiting looking for me there

1329
01:52:20,989 --> 01:52:23,229
I'm gonna brib one second. I'm switching twitch servers

1330
01:52:23,869 --> 01:52:27,550
All good. Look that was a lot better. We got all right. I'm switching servers

1331
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:46,050
I'll switch the servers stream's gonna go off for 30 seconds. I'll be right back. Okay, i'm back

1332
01:52:50,369 --> 01:52:54,449
You got a gun germa and that's huge. That means you're improving. That's huge. Oh puns is down

1333
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:01,760
Oh connor's down. Oh, I think that's it for the one and he's about to go down too. Yep. Well, it's all up to george

1334
01:53:02,779 --> 01:53:05,819
He's me man 13. All right, so we're not 19th

1335
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:12,220
No, we are far from it us getting two kills that game probably solidified us not last

1336
01:53:13,899 --> 01:53:20,140
Which I can't stress this enough for you germa that is enormous when you live with the guy running the tournament

1337
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:25,520
He's he's just gonna be such a pain in my ass about this

1338
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:29,390
Why what do you mean?

1339
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:32,670
well, ludwig is very competitive person and uh

1340
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:35,569
I kind of made a big deal about

1341
01:53:35,569 --> 01:53:37,569
the fortnight tournament from last week

1342
01:53:38,529 --> 01:53:40,050
and uh

1343
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:45,859
He's just he's just gonna he's just gonna rub it in and he's too strong. So I can't I can't

1344
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:48,260
Is ludwig playing in this tournament?

1345
01:53:48,579 --> 01:53:53,779
No, he's just commenting. Oh, okay. He did last time he played and then hosted it

1346
01:53:53,779 --> 01:53:57,939
But I think that's too much which is understandable. Yeah jumping or he's spectating that much too

1347
01:53:58,819 --> 01:54:01,380
Is there gonna be one next week as well every monday?

1348
01:54:02,899 --> 01:54:04,899
Until he decides not to do him anymore

1349
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:10,619
He really did pick a terrible day, huh? Anthony

1350
01:54:11,710 --> 01:54:14,430
Second worst dream. Hey refresh i'm back

1351
01:54:15,229 --> 01:54:18,270
No more dropped frames. I'm never going back to that server again

1352
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:27,920
What right when I said it are you kidding me at a specific time ludwig londay?

1353
01:54:28,399 --> 01:54:32,689
Then he adds the fortnight event. Why is he going past it? I guess I guess

1354
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:36,210
Drum shotgun is that good if he's like passing up a purple

1355
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:41,100
Uh auto shotgun it is the drum. It's like drum over any other shotgun

1356
01:54:43,539 --> 01:54:45,539
Carl seems really deep into this

1357
01:54:47,739 --> 01:54:55,859
What the fuck why did it get worse? Oh my god, i'm about my internet's about to go off

1358
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,720
Am I still in the call with you guys?

1359
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:09,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1360
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:12,779
My connection to the twitch servers are fucking awful right now

1361
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:19,550
Wait carl's are you guys watching carl like his team could just annihilate this. Yeah. Yeah, this is there there's

1362
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:28,029
They're set if I was him. I would just open fire on these guys. I wonder who's igle. Who's who's telling him to hold back?

1363
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:31,149
I don't know. I guess the only reason yeah

1364
01:55:31,149 --> 01:55:33,789
If it was this this is the thing that's the most annoying thing about the twitch server shit

1365
01:55:34,350 --> 01:55:39,489
If this was my internet, I would be that call would be all robotic. What the fuck

1366
01:55:41,279 --> 01:56:09,680
Why does twitch hate my connection coming in? It's fucking annoying. I'll be right back one more time, dude

1367
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:18,500
I I cannot connect to twitch my my internet is perfect. What like what the fuck?

1368
01:56:21,090 --> 01:56:23,460
I don't understand why this keeps happening

1369
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:29,619
I cannot connect to twitch's twitch's server is a junk for me, but i'm in the game. My internet's fine

1370
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:32,899
Um, listen

1371
01:56:32,899 --> 01:56:34,899
Oh carl get shot out of the sky

1372
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:37,060
Look at this. Oh, it's a 4v1

1373
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,350
Unreal

1374
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:46,020
But I my call's not robotic. It's only connecting to twitch. What the fuck i'm trying something else. I'm trying something else be right back

1375
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:55,069
Okay, let's try let's try this guys. I don't fucking get it

1376
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:03,500
Murdered it out

1377
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:09,859
Okay, when this is over i'm mutating ludwig. I'm deleting his phone number. I'm queuing valor and feel something dude

1378
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:12,180
Well, let's just move out

1379
01:57:12,739 --> 01:57:14,100
I'm tired

1380
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:16,140
I'm weary

1381
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:20,029
Okay, so I i'm just like routing my traffic

1382
01:57:20,829 --> 01:57:24,989
In about you know, I don't know why twitch hates my connection so much sometimes

1383
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:35,649
But I went to three or four different servers. What the fuck is happening? All right. We're good

1384
01:57:36,369 --> 01:57:39,810
All right. I'm good to go. I'm back

1385
01:57:40,369 --> 01:57:42,369
They couldn't hold us down forever

1386
01:57:42,689 --> 01:57:44,689
That was better though. That was better. We got one more

1387
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:49,310
Yeah, one more last game. Let's try I kind of want I kind of want there just to be five

1388
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:58,670
Dude, right the false start at the beginning was well was great for us. I won't lie

1389
01:57:59,069 --> 01:58:00,270
Yeah

1390
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:15,119
That's fixed now cool. Yeah, so I have no idea why that keeps happening

1391
01:58:15,979 --> 01:58:17,979
randomly for no reason

1392
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,880
my

1393
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,439
Data coming in through twitch from vegas. It just hates it and it just kills me

1394
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,979
But I jump around to like five different servers and it's like, okay. I'm gonna here you go. You're fine

1395
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:30,380
Literally like as if the problem never existed

1396
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:35,760
None of my internet goes down. I'm at full speed full speed ahead. Nothing. I don't get it

1397
01:58:36,399 --> 01:58:40,430
You got zero viewers. Shut up

1398
01:58:47,550 --> 01:58:52,369
Laying in bed, can I be honest? I've gotten a battle royale

1399
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:55,569
In uh pubg mobile before oh really you played too

1400
01:58:56,689 --> 01:58:59,890
And when it first came out in high school, I played it a little bit when I was on class

1401
01:59:00,449 --> 01:59:02,449
That's high. That's dude

1402
01:59:03,010 --> 01:59:04,140
How old are you?

1403
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:09,819
Uh, 21. Oh my god. I'm 10 years older than you kids had it so good. You know what I did we played psp

1404
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:13,819
Grant f. Dotto liberty city stories and we wi-fi like

1405
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:19,020
Multi-playered I shot my friend jfk style out of a convertible with a sniper rifle on a psp

1406
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:21,579
It's actually my greatest gaming achievement to this day

1407
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:24,529
I

1408
01:59:24,529 --> 01:59:27,899
You say that you're 10 years older got some news for you

1409
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:34,300
I am the middle bear here, huh? Super mario brothers released by the regular nintendo

1410
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:37,739
That's fucked up

1411
01:59:37,739 --> 01:59:40,939
Yeah, I was I was a model warfare 2 land in high school

1412
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:42,140
I had to get uh

1413
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:45,500
My father would always come over and say hey get me six lives and get me to the last boss

1414
01:59:45,739 --> 01:59:48,060
And i'll beat it because we just couldn't do it me and my siblings

1415
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:53,789
So we would have we would spend the whole game trying to get to six lives to get to the last part

1416
01:59:54,430 --> 02:00:00,029
The last level where bowser was and my dad would take the controller and he would beat it as long as we had six lives

1417
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:02,479
Why?

1418
02:00:02,479 --> 02:00:05,869
Why was he why was he it was like a sweatshop?

1419
02:00:06,770 --> 02:00:11,090
Well, no, he was just he knew he could beat the game at that point

1420
02:00:11,090 --> 02:00:13,890
He'd almost memorize the level but in case he died three or four times

1421
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:21,579
He didn't want to upset his children. What if he didn't do it anthony ready up. Oh, sorry. Sorry. That is extremely funny

1422
02:00:21,659 --> 02:00:26,539
How many stepped up how many pubg mobile victor rails under your belt? Oh god, I don't know

1423
02:00:26,619 --> 02:00:29,899
Maybe I feel like whenever I was playing I was playing against like bots

1424
02:00:29,899 --> 02:00:33,819
So I got quite a few but like it wasn't it didn't feel like good like, you know what I mean?

1425
02:00:35,659 --> 02:00:37,180
I feel rewarding. You know what I want

1426
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:41,899
I want pubg like the actual game to come back that game whenever that came out that was like

1427
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:45,260
Peak like that was one of the most funs i've had on it was so fun

1428
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:48,140
Yeah, it was ridiculous. Like I remember my friends me my buddies in high school

1429
02:00:48,619 --> 02:00:51,500
The bit was we just drop pochinki and then just run it

1430
02:00:52,539 --> 02:00:57,180
Dropping school. Yeah, there was pochinki. There was school. I never dropped school school was too much for me

1431
02:00:57,340 --> 02:01:02,539
It was just ridiculous. Yeah, it's a 10 second game if you land but it was it was just so fun

1432
02:01:02,939 --> 02:01:05,579
I think it was it was showing how fun it was

1433
02:01:06,060 --> 02:01:10,460
Even though the game was like such a buggy piece of shit. We all put up with it because we're like this is sick

1434
02:01:11,229 --> 02:01:17,390
Yeah, and still buggy piece of shit to the people playing daisy daisy was huge. Oh my god, dude

1435
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:24,079
I loved daisy. I loved daisy so much like so so much. I used to like play like rp servers

1436
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:26,399
I thought the rp servers were more fun

1437
02:01:26,399 --> 02:01:32,079
Because like there's like dedicated zones where you could kill people just like randomly and otherwise you had to like rob them

1438
02:01:32,079 --> 02:01:33,649
Which was really fun

1439
02:01:33,649 --> 02:01:34,289
Yeah

1440
02:01:34,289 --> 02:01:39,649
That was a real interesting social experiment because people would that was one of the first times people were just kind of given a piece

1441
02:01:39,649 --> 02:01:44,909
Of just big land and just go for it. Oh you you no, no, don't shoot me. Don't shoot me

1442
02:01:45,069 --> 02:01:47,069
Let's talk about this, right?

1443
02:01:47,310 --> 02:01:50,189
That would happen. It was like a weird like kind of experiment

1444
02:01:50,189 --> 02:01:52,989
Which is putting like a hundred what how many people were allowed in a daisy server?

1445
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:56,239
I think like 50 60. Yeah

1446
02:01:57,069 --> 02:02:02,670
I all I know is I was like an absolute menace in that game like a menace. Were you evil? Oh, yeah

1447
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:07,229
Like I I would like I'd like kill people and then like eat them and shit

1448
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:11,710
Yeah, you could eat them. You could you could cut them up and eat them for food

1449
02:02:11,710 --> 02:02:13,710
The fuck

1450
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:22,510
No, no, I was fucked up like I would like rob two people tie them up because you can put them in handcuffs kill their friend

1451
02:02:22,510 --> 02:02:24,510
And like make them eat their friend

1452
02:02:26,189 --> 02:02:29,789
All the most fucked up shit I could do I would just do it. Hey, how's your homie taste, bro?

1453
02:02:30,189 --> 02:02:34,029
I called you a well-rounded individual about 45 minutes ago

1454
02:02:35,229 --> 02:02:37,789
I'd also I'd also like oh, yeah, that's so funny

1455
02:02:37,869 --> 02:02:41,229
I would just I would just like like I would just like because like it was called like

1456
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:43,310
Bambi's like whenever you like fresh spawn

1457
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:46,829
So I was like I would like go get geared up like from like what was it northwest airfield?

1458
02:02:46,829 --> 02:02:53,550
Just get like ridiculously looted go down go back down to spawn and just like like do just do terrible things to the bambi's

1459
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:55,630
Yeah, just eat the new

1460
02:02:56,750 --> 02:03:00,510
Like like somebody walk up like hey dude, you're looted like i'm like standing over a corpse

1461
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:03,149
I was like and I was like like all right, you're gonna eat this guy now

1462
02:03:03,550 --> 02:03:06,260
Yeah

1463
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:08,340
That was the one where you could like build cars, right?

1464
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:09,300
It was really hard

1465
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:09,859
Yeah

1466
02:03:09,859 --> 02:03:12,100
If you had a car and the cars were so buggy like, you know

1467
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:17,220
Many times i'd have like the most gear ever and like we're just driving down a highway and I just die randomly

1468
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:18,500
I'm dead

1469
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,000
It's like, okay

1470
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,810
Yeah cars were fun, you know on like a few servers I played on they like

1471
02:03:24,210 --> 02:03:28,130
Coated in building like you could like I built bases and shit. It was it was awesome

1472
02:03:29,789 --> 02:03:34,510
That was a really cool time in gaming though. It was before a lot of the battle royale stuff

1473
02:03:35,149 --> 02:03:40,579
But people treated it like kind of like a br, but it sort of wasn't but it was yeah. It was like the proto

1474
02:03:41,699 --> 02:03:47,229
because I remember just the only exposure I got to that was watching videos of people like just

1475
02:03:47,789 --> 02:03:53,470
Just like basically not eat other people but like hold people hostage and like because you talk to them and stuff, right?

1476
02:03:53,789 --> 02:03:57,619
And there were just videos of people interacting with each other

1477
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:01,779
When did rust come out because rust was a lot of this stuff too, right?

1478
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:10,180
I don't remember. Did is that the one? Yeah, daniel sl those videos are so fucking funny, dude

1479
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:16,180
He's just clicking his mouse like the sap nap when you were in high school. What was the popular call of duty game?

1480
02:04:17,739 --> 02:04:19,899
I don't know whenever I was in high school. I stopped playing cod

1481
02:04:21,619 --> 02:04:23,539
That's when that's when I went full pc

1482
02:04:23,539 --> 02:04:28,579
Like I got my pc like I built my pc in like eighth grade and then when I got into high school

1483
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:35,659
I just thought I was too good for like cod and xbox and stuff. I was like, oh i'm a pc gamer

1484
02:04:35,819 --> 02:04:39,100
I'm playing college which lines up because when I was in college you were in high school

1485
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:49,300
And then I did a lot of whenever because I was a young impressionable child. I did csgo gambling

1486
02:04:50,289 --> 02:04:51,729
And yes, sir

1487
02:04:51,729 --> 02:04:55,729
The thing was though. I was really good at it. I know you can't be good at gambling

1488
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:57,890
I was just I was incredibly lucky

1489
02:04:57,890 --> 02:05:02,609
I won i'm not even kidding thousands of dollars and I cashed it out and just went on like a spending spree in high school

1490
02:05:02,939 --> 02:05:04,939
Like freshman year. Oh my god

1491
02:05:05,859 --> 02:05:11,819
The sickest thing I ever cracked was a classic knife that I named larry david ssbm. Oh, yeah

1492
02:05:12,140 --> 02:05:17,979
So no, did you guys play tf2? We guys tf2 players. I played a little bit of like a few games

1493
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:20,060
Okay, where are we cranking this? All right boys

1494
02:05:20,779 --> 02:05:21,979

1497
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:34,510
Okay

1498
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:35,550
While we're in the air flying

1499
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:42,029
I will also say the way I won like one of the gambling things I won on csgo is I put five dollars into a 4k pot

1500
02:05:42,189 --> 02:05:47,779
And sniped it like with a point. It was a 0.015 chance. Oh my god. It was just ridiculous

1501
02:05:48,430 --> 02:05:52,640
Oh the restart in the game restarting wait

1502
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:58,640
I'm seeing that right? All right, let's just everyone go totally go tilted go tilted while we can wait just right down

1503
02:05:59,039 --> 02:06:05,180
Wait, we can win this game. We the last ones to disconnect restart. Oh, that's so smart, which is i'm going tilted

1504
02:06:08,210 --> 02:06:10,050
Fucking don't restart

1505
02:06:10,050 --> 02:06:16,100
We can win this game and then in our hearts. We'll know we won one dude. Yes

1506
02:06:17,170 --> 02:06:22,609
We actually need the momentum

1507
02:06:23,569 --> 02:06:25,010
Still fighting

1508
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:27,739
Yeah, so germa

1509
02:06:27,739 --> 02:06:29,260
Germa, yep

1510
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:31,260
We're staying in the game

So we can win it ludwig's in here. He's gonna undefin soon. Do not respond to him. Okay

1691
02:19:57,069 --> 02:19:58,670
Holy shit

1692
02:19:58,670 --> 02:20:03,229
Like why was everywhere we ran there was just people there. I have no idea what's going on in this game

1693
02:20:03,229 --> 02:20:06,750
Hey, at least we thirsted one of those people. Yes, sir. We needed that

1694
02:20:07,950 --> 02:20:09,950
The whole squad needed that

1695
02:20:10,590 --> 02:20:14,030
Oh that game was like so funny. That was a goddamn movie

1696
02:20:17,309 --> 02:20:20,829
All I heard was hey this people everywhere was surrounded by three teams and i'm just like

1697
02:20:21,870 --> 02:20:24,989
It's too stressful. How do people play this game? It's extremely stressful. Yeah

How do people play this this this game is like so intense all these all these brs

1699
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:37,219
Oh

1700
02:20:37,219 --> 02:20:42,100
That was a fun one. I'm good with that. I call that a moral victory royale. That was that was awesome

1701
02:20:42,819 --> 02:20:49,059
Holy shit, we were just getting like shot at by so many people and we all hopped in the car, but that was so funny

1702
02:20:49,459 --> 02:20:50,659
Yeah

1703
02:20:50,659 --> 02:20:56,100
The call for the triple reboot was was very blessed because then they threw a group. He's somebody said he's way too old for this game

1704
02:20:57,219 --> 02:21:02,780
Yeah, I I mean I I don't know it was fun. Whatever. I don't I don't know what the fuck is happening

1705
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:06,829
I just know there's like colors on the screen and there's people surrounding it. I would I don't know

1706
02:21:07,069 --> 02:21:12,750
This is hard. Is it I don't know what to do heart. We did no no one not even fucking close

1707
02:21:15,659 --> 02:21:16,940
That was fun

1708
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:21,420
That was awesome. Well, it's just a uh, it's a nice react content from here on out

1709
02:21:21,819 --> 02:21:31,250
Yeah, i've never seen someone just sit in the first

1710
02:21:31,809 --> 02:21:36,049
Uh red like this for so long. I guess it just really doesn't hurt you that bad

1711
02:21:36,610 --> 02:21:40,049
No, it doesn't the first zone just like barely hurts. He does one tick of damage

1712
02:21:41,250 --> 02:21:45,500
Hey, like look you see this if only I had the vape I would have been better

1713
02:21:46,139 --> 02:21:54,209
Dude, let me tell you what was the last time?

1714
02:21:54,690 --> 02:22:00,079
That I played an fps like or a shooter on stream. It's probably been like

1715
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:07,170
three years

1716
02:22:07,170 --> 02:22:11,489
You did the encouragement guy video you played oh destiny too. That's right. That was a fucking pog game

1717
02:22:13,649 --> 02:22:14,530
This is in my head off

1718
02:22:14,530 --> 02:22:19,409
I think every team that we interacted with followed us like they were like, let's go get those guys

1719
02:22:19,569 --> 02:22:21,569
And then we all ended up in the same place

1720
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:26,479
And then not only did they do that, but then they all continued to only shoot it up

1721
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:30,319
They were like waving at each other like neighbors, dude

1722
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:33,040
Like oh you're killing these idiots, too

1723
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:36,319
That's awesome. Yeah, you guys suck every round they just fucking lose

1724
02:22:36,399 --> 02:22:38,739

02:22:38,739 --> 02:22:42,260
We had the car that was fun. That was fun in the car with you guys. Let me just say

They're that team was in

1747
02:25:23,969 --> 02:25:25,969
13th place. So like they weren't gonna

1748
02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:30,370
Win anyways, I guess whoever's in first isn't gonna want another game

1749
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:38,659
But okay, so here's the thing. I don't play like vr's and when I hear somebody start to scream like oh my they're here

1752
02:25:49,059 --> 02:25:55,889

1753
02:25:57,870 --> 02:25:59,870
Just vibing xqc is still here

1754
02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:05,920
Two in a squad a lot, but he's kind of nuts that

1755
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:33,090
That was insane

1756
02:26:33,090 --> 02:26:36,610
Desync i'm about to play chug jug with you chopped and screwed

1759
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:25,100
Oh, that was an advanced move

1760
02:27:26,450 --> 02:27:28,450
Dude xqc is fucking amazing

1761
02:27:31,729 --> 02:27:33,250
Just born to game

1762
02:27:33,250 --> 02:27:43,659
Forced to stream. I think I think alex is gonna win the turn

1763
02:27:57,139 --> 02:27:59,139
Somebody's like my cat's staring at something on the wall

1764
02:28:01,260 --> 02:28:04,379
Your cat is somebody in chat will investigate it

1765
02:28:09,219 --> 02:28:11,219
Oh their cat. Yeah

1766
02:28:11,299 --> 02:28:17,739
I was thinking they were commenting on maybe your cat in uh in the background, but you have an extremely small cam

1767
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:27,149
And maybe not even a cat correct. Well, I love the size of your camera

1768
02:28:30,399 --> 02:28:32,399
It's just enough

1769
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:37,040
I don't want to there's lots of real estate that information people need to see

1770
02:28:38,399 --> 02:28:39,760
Yes, sir

1771
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:43,440
Plus I don't want people to see my pores and shit and chad warden's all about the games

1772
02:28:44,399 --> 02:28:53,540
If your camera is this small boogers in your nose cannot be picked up it's like the pixels can't they blend together

1773
02:28:55,520 --> 02:29:01,680
Nick that reference might thread the needle of all three of us. Yeah, I don't know. Isn't that crazy? I don't know

1774
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:11,420
Oh x in trouble

1775
02:29:11,500 --> 02:29:14,940
He's healing up

1776
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:18,219
And he has a he's has a grenade. He's gonna blast out of here like jimmy's fucking neutron

1777
02:29:20,139 --> 02:29:23,020
What

1778
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:26,000
Excuse you see this shit is a movie right now. Sorry like the simpsons

1779
02:29:37,489 --> 02:29:38,450
What happened

1780
02:29:38,450 --> 02:29:45,459
No, they're all good gone. I said I think xqc might win because they're getting so many elams right now. Yeah, it's insane

1781
02:29:48,579 --> 02:29:50,579
No, that's the amount of people I can't tell

1782
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:54,340
I've been watching them kill a lot of people

1783
02:29:54,579 --> 02:30:02,190
This is intense xqc has been like 10 hp twice in this game and now he's full max and he's running at someone like an animal

1784
02:30:05,579 --> 02:30:10,899
Oh, oh he's going in

1785
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:17,059
There it is

1786
02:30:17,059 --> 02:30:18,500
Whoa

1787
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:20,420
Oh my god, no way

1788
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:22,420
They didn't even know they with each other was there

1789
02:30:23,059 --> 02:30:28,420
You didn't think I blasted out. This is crazy. I have so much to learn

1790
02:30:29,299 --> 02:30:31,969
It's behind i'm learning. I'm just you know what?

1791
02:30:32,930 --> 02:30:36,049
I'm gonna stick to what I know. I'm not cut out for this at all

1792
02:30:36,049 --> 02:30:40,129
I really not I would have saw that that person in the bush. I would have put both my hands up and gone

1793
02:30:40,690 --> 02:30:42,850
And I would and I would have like grabbed my ticket

1794
02:30:42,850 --> 02:30:44,690
Ticket

1795
02:30:44,690 --> 02:30:49,250
And I would be dead I would that would be like I would hold my chest like this as if a mouse came in the room

1796
02:30:50,450 --> 02:30:52,450
Clutching your pearls

1797
02:30:53,090 --> 02:30:55,489
I just can't but I can watch I can watch these games all day

1798
02:30:56,129 --> 02:30:59,090
Hit him with the oh dear heavens. Yeah, it would be like that

1799
02:30:59,889 --> 02:31:01,889
Oh shit. Oh heaven's me

1800
02:31:03,649 --> 02:31:10,549
This is crazy, they're just fucking killing everyone bro. Oh my god the person was a firework

1801
02:31:11,510 --> 02:31:14,069
They shot themselves it was like fourth of july

Oh my they're just gaming better than everyone else

1803

02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:31,540
So it's like

1805
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:37,399
Maybe 4v4v1 or like 4v3v2. I kind of don't want to move away from xqc's camera

1806
02:31:38,120 --> 02:31:39,479
Oh, I think it's

1807
02:31:39,479 --> 02:31:41,479
One team is another

1808
02:31:41,719 --> 02:31:44,530
Bro, he's just the main character

1809
02:31:49,889 --> 02:31:51,489

That was ridiculous. That was like the three little pigs in there. Oh, yeah

We chose to learn today. We didn't choose to win. That's right. We just hold the back

1822
02:32:57,729 --> 02:32:59,729
Can I just say that was?
