1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:24,629
Hi. Good to see you. Hope you're having a good day. How are you? I was sleeping. Well, wake up.

2
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:44,920
What time is it? God is here. I am not God. No. You guys remember Bruce Almighty,

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:59,689
when he sits down to the prayer email thing, and he presses yes to everybody? I couldn't do it.

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,230
I love that movie. That's a good movie. You need to grant my wish.

5
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:24,950
What if I did a genie stream where I was a genie and I was granting wishes to people?

6
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:43,959
I feel like... I don't know if that would work. You would dare ignore my prayers? How's your day

7
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:55,620
going? It's going well. It's going really well. I feel like the only thing I would be able to do...

8
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:02,150
No, this wouldn't work because we would have to have people kind of pre-screen their genie wishes.

9
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:11,400
Because realistically, genie, can I have some money? Yes, absolutely. I could give you money.

10
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,719
That's the extent of what I can do. I can't really do anything else.

11
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Genie, I really need my driveway paved. I guess I could try. What else would I be able to do?

12
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:34,460
I wouldn't be able to do anything else. I guess you could wish for someone to power wash your

13
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:50,409
driveway and I would come do it. I don't think this idea doesn't work. You have to

14
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:58,009
interpret the wishes like a genie does. Okay, so how I would interpret that one? Oh, great,

15
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:05,610
powerful genie, German985. I would love for you to power wash my driveway. Your wish is my command,

16
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:12,680
but then I send you an invoice. It's a service that you're paying for.

17
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:37,689
It's on Groupon. So you being a genie means you just become a contract labor worker.

18
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:45,620
I mean, what else would you do? Oh, great and powerful genie, I wish for you to go

19
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:53,699
down a hill, a big hill in the neighborhood on a sled. Okay, I could probably do that,

20
00:03:53,699 --> 00:04:00,460
right? But I couldn't do much else. You could wish for me to... Oh, great and powerful genie,

21
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:06,389
I wish for you to go to David Buster's and have a fun two-hour evening. I guess I could do that.

22
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:16,889
There's not much I can really do. What are these wishes? I have to say, I wouldn't be able to fix

23
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:24,439
very many things. It's like, oh, I wish for this, I wish for that. Oh, Joe, great. You wouldn't be

24
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,000
able to wish for world peace or anything with me. I wouldn't be able to do it. I'm not a genie.

25
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,060
You can wish for me to power wash your driveway for the stream would be kind of fun, but I don't

26
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:52,230
think I could do anything else. Fake selfish genie. I just don't, I wouldn't be able to.

27
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:10,730
Okay, I wish for emote only mode. Yeah, I could do that. Oh, great powerful genie, I wish for you to

28
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:17,610
end the stream. These could be kind of fun, but that's not really, I mean, this could be fun for

29
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:24,459
like 10 minutes, not for like three hours. Anyways, here's the plan. We are going to be playing

30
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,120
House Flipper. Their pets update came out. I want to check it out for a little bit.

31
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:39,259
There's also the possibility to play multi-versus. I got access to the alpha. If I want to play that

32
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,100
for a little bit, I can. I don't, maybe I just play House Flipper and we'll play multi-versus

33
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,180
soon because I think that is the alpha. I don't think the alpha is permanent.

34
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:04,889
Yeah, the alpha ends in two days. Well, yeah, whatever. I'll figure it out. Alpha ends in two

35
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:12,949
hours. No, it doesn't. Wait, does the alpha actually end in two days? Does it? When does

36
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:20,360
the alpha end on Friday? It ends in two hours. No, it doesn't. Shut up. It does not end in two hours.

37
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,509
It's still the 20th. All right, somebody just had a helpful message and it got eaten by the automod.

38
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:37,350
It's on, okay, the 27th. When on the 27th? Why does your microphone sound so weird today? I like

39
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,829
it covered it in Vaseline and covered it in like oils and olive oil and stuff. I was trying to get

40
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:54,730
like a nice smoother sound. I don't think it worked. Automod removes all helpful messages.

41
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:01,689
May 27th at 5 p.m. Pacific. All right. So if I don't play it today, then on Friday,

42
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:16,139
I'll play it for like 40 minutes. So that's fine. It's going to be a good stream. I'll play it for

43
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:26,779
like 40 minutes. Whatever. I don't think you guys, nothing helpful was automoded. That's all right.

44
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:33,420
Yeah, we'll play Multi Versus on Friday for an hour and a half, maybe an hour, maybe 30 minutes,

45
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:47,930
or I'll play it tonight if I feel like it. It does look kind of cool though. May 27th. Yeah.

46
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:57,509
Can you do a Street Fighter KO combo? It seems like the game plays identically to Smash Brothers

47
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:06,069
with one kind of major change. It's more team-based, right? You have team recovery moves

48
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:14,040
and stuff, isn't it? Otherwise, it's essentially very much the same game, isn't it? It isn't. It's

49
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:22,970
balanced around 2v2. Oh, okay. I knew that they... No, it's not even close. There's no shields. Okay.

50
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:36,259
Multi Versus is going to be free to play. Oh, that's fine. General, please wish my best friend,

51
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:42,100
my silly fluffball, a happy birthday for the 27th. Please, they are your biggest fan,

52
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:49,340
and it's all they want for their birthday. Happy birthday, silly fluffball. It's me,

53
00:08:49,340 --> 00:09:06,250
JerkBot985, Neil's birthday man. It's my birthday too. Happy birthday to everybody's birthday. I

54
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:13,610
can't do them all. Here, if you have a birthday within the next three to six business months,

55
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:19,299
happy birthday to all those May birthdays, happy birthday to all those June birthdays,

56
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:27,080
happy birthday to all those July and August and September and Donor and Vixen, and then we're

57
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:40,860
going to wrap back around and take back the White House. Yeah. There. Did I cover it all?

58
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:49,320
That's an old meme. Do any of you know what that is? Chat's way too young to know what that is.

59
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:57,990
You kind of are. Maybe you are. You are way... That's way too young for... Yeah. Does anybody

60
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:19,240
in the chat know who Howard Dean is? You have to, right? Who? Whatever. Is that the funny scream

61
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:26,120
guy? He didn't even... All right. He went like, yeah. Everybody fucking freaked out. Like what?

62
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:36,460
Really think about that. He became this meme joke guy because he literally said,

63
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,779
we're going to go to Michigan and Oregon and I'm doing a pump up speech and we're going to go and

64
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:49,019
we're going to win next time. Yeah. This guy's a fucking Looney Tune. This guy's fucked up.

65
00:10:50,259 --> 00:11:09,799
Huh? All he did was cheer. It was absurd. What am I turning it to here? My mic. I know my mic's

66
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:19,059
fucked up right now, but I definitely had time to sit down and fix it. Compressor Andy. Are you like

67
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:41,159
40 years old or something? No, not yet. So what? Hold on. I haven't heard this in a long time.

68
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:49,049
You know something? You know something? We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona

69
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:54,649
and North Dakota and New Mexico. We're going to California and Texas and New York and we're

70
00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:00,409
going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan. And then we're going to Washington

71
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:10,340
D.C. to take back the White House. Yeah! But what? Was that that big? Was that that bad?

72
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,730
What? Because he has he has like a really great like WWE promotion voice. What? He was just

73
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:31,659
yelling. Is that big of a deal? Boomer humor. All right. Fine. We'll get to the zoomer humor.

74
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:47,240
We'll get to the zoomer humor. Here we go. Hi guys. Hi. What's going on here? All right. So

75
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:57,620
the word this is pets DLC. It's time to flip some houses. I don't. So there's new shit here.

76
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:08,700
Here's my computer. Okay. So I have to do I have to do like the pets tutorial DLC. Okay. Because

77
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:15,590
I can't touch this yet. I also have. All right. I remember this is the house that me and Ludwig

78
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:22,009
when we competed. So I got I can sell a lot of this stuff. I can just sell all this and just

79
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:29,659
get a bunch of money. Are there new pet houses? I don't see any new pet houses. I thought there

80
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:39,000
were more houses. Maybe I do have to unlock them. I think I have to unlock them. It's easy money.

81
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,690
Okay. All right. So let's let's just go. Let's do this. This is pet house full of pets. Can you

82
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:50,179
guys hear it? Is it too low? I can't even hear it. Okay. I thought that was it. I thought that was

83
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:57,860
animals. So what is going? What? What? What? This is like one of those children's play mats.

84
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:06,860
Where am I? The training didn't make any sounds. All right. Alice Finbar always wanted to see the

85
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,580
world. After graduating from university, she decided to satisfy her one of us. Three years later,

86
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,059
while on a motor race, found a hungry and sick bunny. Eventually became her travel mate. Alice

87
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:18,779
has bought her first house recently. She wants to move in with Jesper the bunny as soon as possible.

88
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:25,289
Settling down will be something new for both of them. This is freaking me out. This is freaking

89
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:30,299
me out. I don't know why. Okay. So we have, we have to take care of the bunny rabbit. So what

90
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:44,659
do I have to do? Am I high right now? No. The voice acting. And driven a dog sled in Alaska,

91
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:50,820
but house renovation is not really my thing. This is funny. I've heard you can do wonders

92
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,659
and I want my home to be one right now. It's in a worse state than Machu Picchu.

93
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:01,700
What's that? Something more than just my base camp. What's that? A place I can work from,

94
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:09,139
live in, rest. How many animals are in this house? Wait, there's like, why are there tracks?

95
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:16,700
For me and my bunny. And to be happy here too. Let's go out with the old and in with the new.

96
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:27,399
Okay. So I need to do this job to unlock the pet stuff and watch out for that train. Okay. Get rid

97
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:42,899
of that trash. This is a nice house. Is that a, this is pets DLC. Look at this. They added animals.

98
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:57,080
Look at this pets DLC. Why am I still fucking Santa Claus? No, I don't have to do any of this.

99
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:08,059
I actually don't have to do any of this. No, I don't. Wait, remove weeds. Do I really have to

100
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:22,340
do this? All right. I guess I'll remove the weeds. Eat the bugs. Oh, look at that giraffe. This is

101
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:33,990
cool. All right. So just to clean up the trash. Oh, can you step in dog shit in this game? Oh,

102
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,620
that's too bad. It would've been kind of funny if it was like, and then you could just walk around

103
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:45,419
and just track dog shit through the house. Again, I've said, this is a very relevant time for me to

104
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:53,659
bring this up. I have to say it again. When was the last time you stepped in dog shit? It hasn't. I

105
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:59,450
don't think it's happened since I was probably like 13. It's never happened to me. I don't think it's

106
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:06,980
maybe like ever, maybe once or twice ever. Never, right? It's always like such a trope, but I feel

107
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:16,950
like it never happens to anybody. Wait, where's my, what are my tools? Oh, I just smeared that

108
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:45,829
around. I wouldn't put this on the counter. Is that a fucking owl? Can you hear this? There's an

109
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:57,460
owl in here. That's all sounding like fucking toilet sounds. All right. This sounds way too fucking

110
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:17,559
high. That's freaky. I don't like that. What happened in here? Why are there bird feathers

111
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:36,150
everywhere? It's a pigeon. Well, where? Why did the, is this place, were there like animal parties

112
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,160
in here or something? Why, there's dog tracks, there's bird feathers everywhere. There's like

113
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:47,779
piss on the ground. Were they just hanging out in here? No, that's not, those aren't dog prints,

114
00:18:47,779 --> 00:19:08,569
are they? What were they doing up here? Okay. I was going to pick up all the trash. What the fuck?

115
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:31,130
What's happening? Who's calling me? Why is there a dog up here? Why is there a dog up in the box in

116
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:59,140
the attic? Ah, this is going to be my puppy. But do I have, yes, of course. But yes. I can't do that.

117
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:16,329
Why does it have a weird hat on? What do I do with the dog now? Um, what am I supposed to do with

118
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:29,180
the dog? Uh, you want to sit down over here? Hey, um, you're kind of, you're kind of dirty. How do I

119
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:37,589
clean the dog? Do we have to like go to a dog like groomer or something? This, no, that's not how you

120
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:45,140
do it. Why is there blood up here? What is this? Use, what's this? Bunnies are very lively animals

121
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:55,829
and need a lot of space to have fun. The best option is a free roam room, but sometimes they

122
00:20:55,829 --> 00:21:02,779
will be safer in a closed one, especially when we have other animals at home or unsecured stairs.

123
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:15,779
I don't know. Free roam room, I guess, is what I'm deciding on. Are you okay? Okay. That was just like

124
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:41,670
freaked me out for a second. I was like, what happened? Unsafe rabbit room. Unsafe. Really? Um,

125
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:51,339
what? This puppy's name is Lassie. Helper, energetic, and is a fussy eater. Okay. So let's,

126
00:21:51,339 --> 00:22:07,700
um, you want some food? Oh, all right. I want a treat. You actually throw them. Okay. What about

127
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:21,299
clean? What is tug of war? Like pet is busy. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

128
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:43,619
All right. Slow down. Fetch. Oh, go get it. Where'd it go? Will you catch it in the air? I got it. I

129
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,930
got it. I got it. I got it. Don't go up there. Please don't go up there. All right. All right.

130
00:22:47,930 --> 00:23:10,250
Let me see it. All right. Fetch. Wait, how many things can I use? Will they catch it? You all

131
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:27,690
right? Are you okay? Now we're going to get rid of these. I need to give you a bath or something.

132
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,950
Don't, how do I remove these? Just remove it. I don't want to throw it over the fucking fence.

133
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:44,099
Okay. How are we doing up here with, uh, with the cleaning? It's good. Looks good. Looks good.

134
00:23:44,099 --> 00:24:01,079
I clean these, uh, windows. It's good. I, I literally, I would look, watch. I thought,

135
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:08,470
okay. So when I went like this, he jumped in the air. He jumped in the air at one time,

136
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,549
didn't he? He went like this. I thought he was going to jump up and grab it. I don't know.

137
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:18,900
Don't be sad here. Just take another one. Look, this is there. They're all made out of like soft

138
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:31,509
rubber or something. Ready? See? Look, I thought that he was going to catch it. Do you want this?

139
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:41,720
And there we go. Okay. All right. You're good up here. Just be careful. Anything else to clean?

140
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:54,809
All right. It's clean, clean. It's going to be nice and clean. The dog can't understand you.

141
00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:08,170
Come with me. Maybe you shouldn't come down here. It's probably kind of dangerous.

142
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:23,180
Look at all this. We're not playing thief simulator. What is it? What even is that then?

143
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:38,410
I thought this was a painting. I didn't think it was a rug. Okay. Looks pretty good. Looks pretty

144
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:46,920
good. That was an eagle. How many different animals are here? Did you hear that? That was a

145
00:25:46,920 --> 00:26:00,950
literal eagle. Oh, wait. Where's the dog? How do I call the dog? Should I get the dog like a spray,

146
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:12,630
like a spray down or something? Come on down here. Is that, should I go take like a bath or

147
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:20,500
something? Go play with the water? I don't know. Follow me. Okay. Follow me. I wonder if this will

148
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:32,140
work. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. All right. Well, get over here. Let's go. We're going

149
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,680
to give you a little bath. What's the temperature outside? It's nice and hot. It's a nice hot day,

150
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:45,430
right? Okay. Here we go. Do you want to, do you want some of this? Do you want to play with them?

151
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,380
Okay. There's a fucking bald eagle in this neighborhood. Like this, this is freaking me

152
00:26:51,380 --> 00:27:04,059
out. There's a bald eagle here. Okay. Should I do this? We think this is like fun. How do I

153
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:21,400
wash the dog? I don't think this works. I don't like the fact that you're over here. I don't,

154
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:28,119
I don't like this. I don't like the fact that there's a fucking train over here.

155
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:37,579
No, you're going to the house. Uh, uh, put them in the bathtub. All right. Well, first of all,

156
00:27:38,140 --> 00:28:00,069
let me figure. All right. I'm almost done with the cleaning. Oh, come here. This way. No. What

157
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:13,609
am I? How do I? Okay. Well, just be careful. How are we looking? We look pretty clean. Is there

158
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:23,529
a basement? They're probably, this is pretty clean already. What else is dirty? Oh, you want

159
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:38,019
the other stuff. Okay. So you want a magna leather soft, magna leather left corner sofa, 1500 bucks.

160
00:28:40,650 --> 00:29:02,440
Actually, this thing's huge. Okay. Jell-o coffee table and, uh, pom-pompa's grass. There you go.

161
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:20,519
Here, boy. Here, boy. All right. Let's go. The boring color. It's a girl. Oh shit. Here, girl.

162
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:41,750
Close the front door. All right. So now what do I unlock? What do I unlock? The eagle is going to

163
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:58,380
get her. Oh, this is our house. No, no, no, no. This can't be our house. Wait, you have a, you,

164
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:07,450

00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:46,759
is really not okay. This is not okay. Get rid of this shit. I can't have my precious puppy here.

169
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:05,539
Get rid of this. We'll get a, we'll get to a better house. This is dangerous. Okay. It's not,

170
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:13,019
it's not dangerous over here anymore. Okay. That looks fine. All right. All right. All right. I

171
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:23,980
just want to get all the immediate problems over here. Okay. All right. That's cool. Needs hygiene.

172
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:37,220
How do I do that? What, what do I, is there really like a dog hygiene thing? Dog, dog chew toy,

173
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:47,059
dog mat. Here we go. Washing tub for large dogs. All right. Washing tub for small dogs. All right.

174
00:31:47,059 --> 00:32:09,960
Come here. What's this thing on my face? I don't know. Okay. Here we go. Now it's, can I do that

175
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:40,460
a little more gently? Wow. Look at the difference. Okay. Here, have a treat. Oh, I just threw it away.

176
00:32:42,490 --> 00:33:01,349
Have a treat. No, come out of the, no, get out of there. Look at, she's so cute. Okay. Go right here

You want some water? Come on, please. I want to hear it. Nice. Okay. So you, are you okay? You just

179
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:34,569
sit here by yourself. These, all right. These birds are fucking annoying. I'm just going to be

180
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:45,420
honest. I feel like they're in my head and why are there, what kind of bird is that? Why are there

181
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:58,339
tropical birds here? All right. I'm going to, let's, where's the laptop? What birds? You know,

182
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:19,769
how do you not hear the birds? All right. Where's the laptop? Okay. Morgan's pet care. Bunnies,

183
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:27,849
rodents, reptiles. You mean to tell me that I could have just a house full of birds, reptiles,

184
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:43,579
snakes and spiders? Hold on. Can I just have like a hundred spiders? No, I can't. All right. But wait

185
00:34:43,579 --> 00:35:02,420
a minute. Okay. Snakes. Should I make a snake house? How about a bird house? Does it have parrots

186
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:36,679
everywhere? Oh, look at the cats. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. A little Bengal. A Norwegian. Bragg doll.

187
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:48,119
How about a little Bengal? But wait, what's the pet hotel? Pets at home. Oh, find a new, move to

188
00:35:48,119 --> 00:36:02,260
hotel. Pet hotel. What's the tutorial? I can't fucking think of the birds. Okay. Choose an

189
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,260
enclosure for small animals. You have a, there's a pet panel. You have pets and jobs. You can take

190
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:13,989
cats and dogs on a job with you. Okay. You'll pet, we'll get a hat, which will turn off its needs.

191
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:20,780
It's magic. That's cool. Different traits. Different. Okay. The helper traits. Oh, they can, they can

192
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:29,139
help. Don't put your mouth in that. It'll dig holes when needed and can carry the paint for you.

193
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:46,860
Okay. Playing, feeding, sleep, bath time, going potty. The pet hotel. All right. So they can,

194
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:55,940
I get it. I need a place to go first. So let's go back and let me see the browser for purchase.

195
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:06,420
All right. Here we go. There's this house here. I can buy this. The blue snuggery. This is the house

196
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,909
I was just at. All right. I'm going to go, I'm going to go sell some of these houses that I don't

197
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:21,239
really want. Fix up your house first. That can be my house. Watch. I'm just going to sell this. Watch

198
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:37,690
this. I'm literally, I'm going to sell this place right now. Yeah. Just we're selling this right now.

199
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:51,639
Sell. Sell as is. Nah, you can do better than that. I want at least what I paid for it. I want at

200
00:37:51,639 --> 00:38:02,699
least what I paid for it. At least 150. That's fine. I can negotiate. Now that's all right. I'll

201
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:13,940
take it. I'll negotiate a little bit though. I want another five grand. All right. There we go.

202
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:22,460
Yeah. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Appreciate it. Accept the offer. I didn't do anything to

203
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:42,949
this house. I didn't even care. Holy shit. These are not the photos you want to put on the Realtor

204
00:38:42,949 --> 00:39:00,019
website, but it's all right. I sold it. Art of the deal. Now let's, ah, this is like so, I hate this.

205
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:06,679
We're not staying here though. I'm moving to another house. The microphone shadow makes it

206
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:11,289
look like you have a black eye. Whatever. Okay. All right. Now we're going to go sell the other

207
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:21,179
house. Is there a stain on your webcam? No, it's a shadow and there's gunk in my ear or something

208
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:37,429
because it feels weird in there. What was that? Okay. Browse. Um, this is the man cave. I'm just

209
00:39:37,429 --> 00:40:00,150
going to sell it. I don't even know what this is. Sell it. $268,000. I just want what I paid for it.

210
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:07,400
Turn the ambience down. I will. This person wants a sauna in their house. I should have

211
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:18,340
sold them the other ones. Okay. $184,000. All right. Let me negotiate a little bit here.

212
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:23,750
I'll lose like a thousand bucks. Whatever. Okay. All right. I lost a thousand. It doesn't matter.

213
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:35,050
Fine. I just need, I need capital. That's a handshake deal if I've ever seen one.

214
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:49,989
It just got a little darker. The time of day changed. That's the only difference.

215
00:40:52,170 --> 00:41:11,670
Oh my God. What happened to the driveway? I got to sell the, uh, the versus Ludwig house.

216
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:22,710
I feel like I might get some good money for that one. I got $450,000 bucks. We're going to do

217
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,230
another couple of animal jobs because I want to unlock some, I want to unlock some animal houses.

218
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:33,019
Okay. Owned. This is where I am right now. So I'm going to sell this one and then I'll buy another

219
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:55,610
one eventually here. No more birds, please. I'll fix it in a minute. It's even like still too loud

220
00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:15,349
at 0.08. We are down to one cent and I can still hear them. Okay. That's fine. That better. That's

221
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:28,679
fine right there. All right. So I saw I'm going to sell this house, put it on auction. Oh, this

222
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:43,590
is going to be a big profit. I forget what happened in this one. I'll take it. Not bad.

223
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:56,650
You took it from the bed, which is weird. Not much change there.

224
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:08,230
TV. All right. Good. I got like six or $700,000 now. I got a lot of money. I can take that and

225
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:14,789
I can buy a huge like half a million dollar house and I'm going to have snakes. I'm going to have

226
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:26,780
spiders. I'm going to have other animals. We're not going to stay here for very long. Oh no,

227
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:42,150
you puked. No, that's grass. What did you, what is going on here? What is all this? Oh my God. Watch

228
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:56,090
out. Watch out. Watch out. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. All right. We

229
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:01,219
got to get out of here. We got to find, we got to get a new place. We got to get a new place.

230
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:06,500
All right. What's the, I need to do one more. I need to do another animal job to unlock some

231
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:13,739
more animal stuff. Terrified of moles. I don't want the mole to attack my puppy. It looked like

232
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:24,010
they were, it looked like he was about to start fighting. Okay. Let's see. We did that one. I want

233
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:37,750
to unlock shit. What's this one? Animal caretaker. There is the only one I can do. All right. I can

234
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:54,969
do this one. Okay. So what do I have to do? Do I have to help with, oh, is this the animal hospital

235
00:44:54,969 --> 00:45:11,179
area or something? There is this saying about changing the world. I'm sure you know it. When

236
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:17,019
started with myself, now it's time for my home. So what do you need? Structure and order. They

237
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:23,590
are crucial for my plans. This is how I see it. Cats and dogs will have their rooms downstairs.

238
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:32,199
Got it. The other pets in the attic. Okay. Yes. I know it's such a nice room, but it's worth it.

239
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:37,800
It's nothing compared to what they went through. Okay. What so many stray pets experience every

240
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:47,190
day? Can't save them all, but a few is more than none, right? Was that, that was a rubber chicken.

241
00:45:49,320 --> 00:46:00,309
Okay. The animal caretaker. So what's the job? That eagle is going to freak me. I swear to God,

242
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:03,989
it's going to come attack me. All right. What do you need? What do you want me to do?

243
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:09,219
What are we looking for? This, your house is wonderful. This is a beautiful home.

244
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:17,449
What do you need me to do? I mean, you want me to pick up shit and rearrange it and,

245
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:26,539
okay. Upstairs, right? Look at all this. Where are all the animals?

246
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:39,110
All right. You want this new. Sell the drawers, sell this, sell the whole room, sell everything.

247
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:49,670
Okay. That can go. That can go. What else do you need? Picture birch. Yeah. Okay. I could see that.

248
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:59,130
Painting of a forest road. Yeah. Okay. So now you want a dog. Oh, this is where the dog

249
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:15,079
stuff is. All right. I got you. Dog bed. This is the one you want. Looks good. Right here. No,

250
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:26,699
that's too close to the radiator. How about in the corner? That looks good. Okay. We don't want them

251
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:32,250
to be too, okay. Like there, that looks all right right there. All right. You want a light under

252
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:41,050
bowl mat. That looks fine. Yep. Right there. It looks all right to me. Everybody's going to get

253
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:51,429
their own mats to eat and drink off of. Two automatic food dispensers. Yes. House flipper.

254
00:47:51,429 --> 00:48:12,019
Yes. Okay. Two water dispensers. All right. I'm just doing this to unlock. Rubber chicken,

255
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:27,269
chew toy, tennis ball, a big cat tree. Put it right here so they can look out the window.

256
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:37,929
Cats really like looking out windows, right? That's all right. Okay. Mouse cat toy. You got it.

257
00:48:37,929 --> 00:48:52,280
Okay. Okay. One of these over here. Okay. Litter box. All right. That can go right here. Looks

258
00:48:52,280 --> 00:49:04,500
good. Now I need two of these. All right. That's fine. Right there. Okay. I need a pee pad. There's

259
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:10,679
a lot of shit going in this room. Pee pad. All right. I need a pee pants. Put it right. Let's

260
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:26,889
put it over. I don't like over here. No, not near the food. Like right here. This needs to move.

261
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:38,710
There's toys everywhere. You're messing with the feng shui. All right. Pee pad will go right here

262
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:47,300
and then this litter box will go right here. Okay. That's fine. All right. Now this is a dog carpet.

263
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:57,110
Really cool. Okay. And then we're going to do a double foot stool or what is this? What's this

264
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:12,119
for? What is this for? You can't fit all this shit in this room. Okay. Automatic cat water feeder.

265
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:30,150
There's too many. They're all going to be in this room at the same time. What? Dog enclosure.

266
00:50:42,760 --> 00:51:28,579
Interior dog enclosure. Like this? Just little dividers. That's fine. Put it down. I can't put

267
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:46,219
this down. Why? There's so much shit in this room. Oh, okay. It doesn't matter. There's so much shit

268
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:57,510
in this room. Breed chat. What? He said the attic too. Use the other rooms. I thought it was...

269
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:08,409
The game usually is whatever room you're in, it tells you what to do. That's usually how the game

270
00:52:08,409 --> 00:52:12,329
works, right? It's whatever room you're currently in. These are the objects that you need to put in

271
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:31,480
here. That's how it's been the whole time. Forever. For like five years. Floor tiles. I'll move it.

272
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:42,170
It's been like that forever. It's whatever room you're currently in. For the missions, at least.

273
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:53,400
Yeah, no. It is this room. See, room 37M2. It is this room. Yeah, I was right. Put the food

274
00:52:53,400 --> 00:53:30,329
under the mats. All right. Bon appétit. Can I? He can rearrange this however much he wants. There we

275
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:36,730
go. Okay. See? That's better. Toys need to go in the corner. This is not even my house. I don't want

276
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:41,579
to put that much time into this because I want to do my own. This is not my house. I'm just trying

277
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:46,460
to make some money so I can buy my own animal house. If you want to come in here and rearrange

278
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:54,619
it, that's fine. You can come in and do it. This is a home designing game. Bro, House Flipper is my

279
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:59,340
number one most played game on stream. You don't think I know what I'm supposed... I'm just trying

280
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:17,050
to do the missions quickly to be able to buy the house, bro. Now we've got to go to the attic.

281
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:32,539
Where are the mats? I just want to do the mission so I can unlock the stuff because I want to make

282
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:45,050
my own. I didn't say sell. My awesome entertainment center, dude. Oh, you didn't? Oh, okay.

283
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:58,019
Oops. Actually, you did want me to do that. All right. Bunny enclosure. Yeah, it is the same room.

284
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:04,119
All right. So we should just go like in the corner over here. I'm thinking it doesn't matter. I'm

285
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:16,519
going to do my own. Okay. This is for a... this is for a guinea pig. Whoa. That's huge. Okay. Let's

286
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:26,869
put this one over here. Turtle aquarium. I want to do this so bad. I don't care about this other

287
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:33,239
person's house. I want a bunch of turtles. I want a bunch of... There's hamsters, too. Hamsters.

288
00:55:33,320 --> 00:56:12,469
Look at how cool this is. Okay. Furry carpet. A big pantry. Sure thing. And poof. Poof over there.

289
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:17,190
Poof over here. And a poof over here. Sounds good. Awesome. All right. Cool. I'm gonna give

290
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:28,139
you that money so I can do my own. There was one more down here, right? This is... yeah,

291
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:38,940
the house is already pretty nice. What are the rooms? It was downstairs, right? Yeah,

292
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:52,300
this room looks like shit. I know. But I... I'm just trying... where do I need to go? The bathroom.

293
00:56:52,300 --> 00:57:00,519
Bathroom. The upstairs bathroom or downstairs bathroom? Wasn't that the attic that I was just

294
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:11,960
in? Yeah, I did the attic already. It's whatever bathroom I just was in. I don't fucking know.

295
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:30,170
This is the bathroom. Bathroom? Where is there another bathroom on this floor? You have a

296
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:37,460
bathroom in the backyard? No. There's another bathroom. First floor bathroom. Yeah. But how

297
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:56,500
come this says 11 meters by second power, not 12? Where is it? Oh, okay. Here it is. All right.

298
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:08,730
Let's go. Bathtub plumbing system. I want to get rid of that. All right. Okay. All right.

299
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:20,900
Arrange the ceiling tiles. Oh, that's right. You can do ceilings now. Right. That's part of the

300
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:35,380
update. You can paint ceilings. You can tile ceilings now. Big update. Big deal. All right.

301
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:43,380
I did it. That's fine. I don't need to do anything else. Goodbye. I just... I'm just trying to unlock

302
00:58:43,380 --> 00:59:02,889
the stuff. I didn't... all that trash. I didn't do that. This dude has no passion in his work.

303
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:08,059
I'm... you'll... you want to see passion, you'll see it. Just wait. I think I probably unlocked

304
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:29,030
another house. Okay. Browse for purchase. All right. I just unlocked that house. Should I try

305
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:36,329
to find another one that's bigger? I think I want a bigger house than that. I want a huge house.

306
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:49,059
That one looks all right. No. That one looks... this one looks pretty big. I want... okay. This

307
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:56,070
one's huge. This one's huge. And it's right on the water. Let's... let's... let's get this one.

308
00:59:56,070 --> 01:00:07,050
I need a man-sized house. Actually, this is not that big.

309
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:14,139
The inspiration has been hitting me pretty hard lately. My creative spark feels kind of

310
01:00:14,139 --> 01:00:23,030
damn great out. Colors, fluffy blankets, and lots of cozy furniture. This is what I truly need.

311
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:31,639
I always imagined myself in my skelly cutie in a lakeside house with a wooden terrace,

312
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:37,000
maybe even a small sauna. Somewhere I would be able to flourish as a writer.

313
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:45,510
But I don't... this is not big enough. I could have different houses for different animals.

314
01:00:48,150 --> 01:01:04,340
And you need a man-sized dinosaur park. This is a huge yard though. Okay. This is a lot of work.

315
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:13,940
You can change the stairs. I think this is a lot of work. Oh, this is a... this is big though. Yeah,

316
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:20,250
this is big. This is huge. Look at how big this is. There's a lot of downstairs real estate there.

317
01:01:24,739 --> 01:01:35,989
All right. All right. I think I want this one. I think I want this one. Is it available now,

318
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:43,690
or do I have to do the mission first? Build this house with spiders. What do you mean I can't have

319
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:53,980
it? Why not? I wonder if it's unlocked. If I have to do the mission first, that sucks. You have to

320
01:01:53,980 --> 01:02:05,429
clean this whole house. I'm gonna have to clean the house twice. I'm gonna have to clean the whole...

321
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:19,989
Okay, I'm gonna do speed run it. I'll speed run it. Okay, I'm gonna speed run it. I'm just gonna do

322
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:34,900
the bare minimum. I want this house. I want this house. All right, here we go. Time to speed run.

323
01:02:34,900 --> 01:03:25,670
Go. Fast. Very fast. Fuck that. I'm just gonna do the... this is gonna take too long. I'm going in.

324
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:40,219
There's just shit everywhere. I want to be... I'm gonna have a different enclosures for different

325
01:03:40,219 --> 01:04:00,119
animals. Okay, looks good. Let's get the broom out here quick. And then I'm just gonna start

326
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:08,260
placing objects. Do you want to play the game? That's what I'm doing. I want to just do this

327
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:11,539
mission real quick. Because here's the thing. I'm gonna buy this house and I'm gonna have to

328
01:04:11,539 --> 01:04:17,239
do this all over again. Don't you understand? I don't want to sit here and just waste time

329
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:29,530
if I'm gonna have to do the whole thing again anyways. You want this. I wouldn't pick this,

330
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:42,380
but that's your choice. I'm just trying to fill the progress meter. Uh-huh. Looks good. You want

331
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:55,159
it in the whole thing, right? All right, beautiful. I wouldn't... I don't know. I wouldn't do this.

332
01:04:55,159 --> 01:05:02,090
Play breakcore. No, it's way too early to do that. It's way too early to start playing breakcore

333
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:16,659
during the stream. Just keep... you have to wait a few minutes. I need this. It does not matter

334
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:44,199
where the fuck it goes. I don't care. The dump sink that you want. That's fine. Okay. I'm just

335
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:48,760
going for completion. Trust me when I say I'm not. This is just to get... so I can get in the house.

336
01:05:48,760 --> 01:06:04,940
I put the cabinets on the ceiling. I'm... trust me. I know people are like, dude, just fucking play,

337
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:32,329
but I have to do this all over again. I feel like I'm a moving company that just brought all the

338
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:37,369
shit in here, put it in there, and just left. Wait, I thought... wasn't part of the charge that you

339
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:50,219
were gonna help me assemble? Nope. It's like if an AI played the game. It does look like that.

340
01:06:52,659 --> 01:07:05,460
It does. The AI just knows it has to do one specific task. That's fucking funny. Whatever.

341
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:11,219
That progress meter is gonna... this would take like six fucking hours if I were to do this legit.

342
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:17,059
Don't you want those six hours to be spent making our own house? Not somebody else's? Don't you get

343
01:07:17,059 --> 01:07:29,059
it? What is this? Oh my god. Where... can this go in the other room? It can't go in another room.

344
01:07:29,059 --> 01:07:56,820
Fucking iguana enclosure has to go in here. Oh my goodness. Whatever. I keep running out of room.

345
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:07,349
You want two of these? Where do you want me to put them? It doesn't matter. It does not matter.

346
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:22,170
Can I put it... this would have taken so fucking long and you all know it. It's sort of taken

347
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:31,500
four hours to do all this. You have to trust me on this. Just please trust me. Just please trust me.

348
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:57,609
Okay? And you want your TV... I don't care where your TV goes. I really don't. All right. Pretty

349
01:08:57,609 --> 01:09:04,869
good. Now I should do the rest of the house. This would have taken me fucking six hours.

350
01:09:04,869 --> 01:09:18,359
Okay. Where's the terrace? Garden. You want me to do all this shit out in the garden? This would have

351
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:43,220
taken forever. I will spend time on mine. Okay. This is going to get a lot of progress. Yep. That

352
01:09:43,220 --> 01:10:03,100
progress meter is going up. Okay. Terrace. Clean the dirt. Do you sound like a Dr. Seuss book?

353
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:19,779
What? All right. I need to do... oh this is gonna be nice. Okay. You want these out here. I know

354
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:24,329
there's puke everywhere. It's fine. We're just going for progress. Again, I would reiterate a

355
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:46,069
million times if I have to. I want a nice hangout zone out here. Okay. Decorative puke. It kind of...

356
01:10:46,069 --> 01:10:58,260
it does look like decorative puke. You're right. Can you imagine? I thought that cannon just shot

357
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:07,750
at me. So you hire somebody to come clean and rearrange your whole house and the whole time

358
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:12,739
they're going, I gotta hurry the fuck up. I gotta clean my house. I gotta take care of my house. I

359
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:19,609
gotta rearrange my furniture. So they do a half-assed job on your house. That's kind of unfair,

360
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:58,279
isn't it? Is this the terrace too? That progress needs to go up. Is this helping? Kind of. Okay.

361
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:14,390
Clean that up. I think we're almost halfway there. Get the spray. Close that up. Looks nice. Good,

362
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:21,829
good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Clean. How much is the progress of the windows

363
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:41,819
giving me, I wonder? That always feels so good. Nice. Okay. Remove weeds. Only 10%. This is really

364
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:57,689
dragging the progress down. Yeah, definitely. This shouldn't take too long to get all these.

365
01:12:57,689 --> 01:13:21,270
Yeah, that's definitely filling up fast. Use the flamethrower? I don't even have it. I think this

366
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:57,909
is slower. This is slower. 70, 80%. Let's go. 97%. 98%. Dirt. Where? Okay. All right. We're good.

367
01:13:57,909 --> 01:14:17,079
There's one here. 99. Just give me the fucking house already. There's a few more windows to clean.

368
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:32,869
Watch. New basement entrance. Oh, that went away. That's gone. Okay. Well, sorry. You have no access

369
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:54,899
to your house anymore. Very nice. Okay. Halfway there. Can I not climb in through the window?

370
01:14:54,899 --> 01:15:21,189
You gotta be kidding me. Okay. Here we go. Buy this shit. It's already there. This, this, this

371
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:45,369
chair, light switch, three of these, six of these candles. Where's the passion? I don't have any

372
01:15:45,369 --> 01:15:50,729
passion for this. I need to get to my house. I don't have, what do you mean? I don't have, why?

373
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:57,670
I don't have any passion. I have lots of passion for my own space. I'll show it to you. This is

374
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:18,939
just to get the money to fucking, he's, there's no passion. I will show it to you. You want to see,

375
01:16:18,939 --> 01:16:23,699
I will show you passion. I promise. This is going to be a long stream. So don't worry. It's fine.

376
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:29,289
I don't know how many they wanted, but that's enough. And then cigars or something. All right.

377
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:34,539
Here we go. All right. Cool. Look at that progress. Almost done. There's still some trash that needs

378
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:45,380
to come out of this room. Clean that up. It doesn't matter. All right. Let's go in this room. What do

379
01:16:45,380 --> 01:17:00,710
you want in here? Okay. Here we go. We're good. That's an ugly bed. I'm sorry that that actually,

380
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:23,100
I think is an ugly bed. See, I don't care about this shit. It's not my house. How are you supposed

381
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,239
to fit all this shit? People put way too much stuff in their bedrooms. You know what you need

382
01:17:27,239 --> 01:17:37,109
in your bedroom? Here's what you need in your bedroom. You need a bed, an end table, a lamp,

383
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:50,699
and that's it. And maybe draw like this for your clothes. There's too much shit in their bedrooms.

384
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:57,369
You need maybe like a painting above the bed or something, right? Or like on the wall, like over

385
01:17:57,369 --> 01:18:02,600
here. I don't know. People put way too much shit in their bedroom. Like I don't, I'm sorry. I don't

386
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,359
want this. I don't want a fucking gigantic tropical plant next to me when I sleep. I just don't want

387
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:11,020
one. I feel like I'm just going to get in the way. I'm going to get annoyed by it. Ceiling fans. I'm

388
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:15,510
scared of ceiling fans. I feel like I don't want to ceiling people. Oh man, ceiling fans are no.

389
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:18,310
Ceiling fans. I feel like they're going to spin and drop and kill me and they're going to chop

390
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:22,949
me up in a thousand pieces. I actually think that when I pull the lever and I see a ceiling fan

391
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:29,479
spinning, it always freaks me out. I don't like it. I, it's just, I don't know. Sometimes some

392
01:18:29,479 --> 01:18:33,819
ceiling fans aren't really screwed on all the way and they kind of go like this while they spin

393
01:18:33,819 --> 01:18:37,560
really fast. And it's just like, that doesn't look, I want that to be secured with a bolt.

394
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:59,130
I don't like it. Oh, these are pictures. I was like, what is it on these? That's supposed to

395
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:08,420
happen. That's not, no, I don't, I don't like it. I don't care if it's supposed to happen or not.

396
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:15,770
I don't want to be looking straight up at a thing that is going like this spinning really fast

397
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:24,170
because if I, I'm afraid to close my eyes under that. I don't like it. Something about it freaks

398
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:43,529
me out. What can I even put this on? What is this supposed to go on? A shelf or something?

399
01:19:44,170 --> 01:20:01,079
Okay. There we go. Okay. Almost done. You want the same carpet everywhere. Two of them. Really?

400
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:11,140
Why do you want this in your room? This is a swing. You're putting way too much shit in

401
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:20,420
your bedroom. That your bedroom for me, I mean, that's a place to sleep. You go sleep. I don't

402
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:36,119
want a bunch of distractions and just shit everywhere. Okay. Almost done. And plus we're

403
01:20:36,119 --> 01:20:41,350
taking down some walls as well. I'm not, this is not the way that I want my house to be. Okay.

404
01:20:41,350 --> 01:21:12,899
What do you want? Paint the ceiling with lime cream. All right. Okay. Mountable oval bathtub.

405
01:21:12,979 --> 01:21:25,449
You want these on the wall? Is that what I'm assuming? Yeah. Okay. Here we go. We're almost

406
01:21:25,449 --> 01:21:40,119
there. Santa's got way more important shit to be doing right now. You guys understand? I think,

407
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:49,699
you know what's bullshit? We treat Santa like a Madden release. This motherfucker has to prepare

408
01:21:49,699 --> 01:21:56,020
Christmas for just a one year. No, no, no. They should, it should be, Christmas should be every

409
01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:03,079
two years. So Santa has more time to fucking deal with the presents. I think, I don't know. I feel

410
01:22:03,079 --> 01:22:07,539
like he doesn't have enough time. It takes a whole, at least a fucking year to get the shit

411
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:26,739
ready. Santa's not real. Madden isn't real either. What are you talking about? Start, um, start

412
01:22:26,739 --> 01:22:29,539
timing people off for that. Like, I don't know what the fuck they're talking about. That's annoying

413
01:22:29,539 --> 01:22:54,569
though. Where does this go? Are you sponsored by Santa? No. How dare you say Madden isn't real?

414
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:02,970
Every new Madden game, is it? What are you talking about? All right. We're almost there.

415
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:19,000
There it is. Okay. Put it together. Like all the WWE games, all the NBA games, they come out once

416
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:43,060
a year and come on, Gwen. I'm sad that the court stream never happened. Me too. That joke is long,

417
01:23:43,060 --> 01:24:00,630
long dead though. Unfortunately. Okay. What's going to put it over the edge here? One of the

418
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:29,899
showers, multiple sink. That's right here. Explain? Um, oh, there's probably a lot of you that don't

419
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:38,579
know what I'm talking about or what Chad is talking about either. Uh, years ago, um, I killed Santa on

420
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:48,260
stream. Like, I don't know, it was like 2016 or something, 2017. And the joke was I was going to go

421
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:56,710
to court for it and get tried for the murder of Santa. And Santa, we were going to have lawyers.

422
01:24:56,710 --> 01:25:04,550
Santa's lawyer was going to sing all the prosecution. I was going to be up, he was going to be cross

423
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:10,979
examining witnesses and stuff and he was going to be singing the whole thing. Um, at the end,

424
01:25:11,619 --> 01:25:17,260
it was going to be up to you guys if I was guilty or innocent. And the punishment was going to be

425
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:22,220
the judge was going to smash the gavel down and say, like, I sentenced you to three Minecraft

426
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:26,069
streams in a row. And he's going to smash the thing and everyone's going to freak out. Everyone's

427
01:25:26,069 --> 01:25:29,880
going to be fucking screaming. Everyone's going to start crying and stuff. Um, and that was going

428
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:34,199
to be the joke. And I had to play Minecraft three times. There you go. There's the whole thing

429
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:43,750
because there's just no way it's happening. Like ever guilty. Yeah. Everyone would have said guilty.

430
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:54,420
There's no way you would have made me innocent. Not even remotely a chance though. Can you just

431
01:25:54,420 --> 01:26:05,020
play Minecraft for real? No, I can't. I don't play. I can't play Minecraft. I can't. I, every time I

432
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:11,300
play Minecraft, especially if I make a video or stream Minecraft, I do the same thing every time.

433
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:17,880
I start to build a dirt house. I make a wooden floor. I make a cobblestone wall. The ceiling

434
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:23,699
is half cobblestone, half dirt with five to 10 holes in it. And then I go dig down and I make

435
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:27,989
what I'm going to say is I'm going to make a mine down here that connects to the bottom of the house

436
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:35,220
and then I die at the bottom and I uninstall the game. It happens every single time. I don't think

437
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:42,569
I've ever gotten past the making a fully cobblestone enclosed house. I don't think

438
01:26:42,569 --> 01:26:51,449
I've ever gotten. I've gotten like iron in my inventory. Do you still consider yourself a

439
01:26:51,449 --> 01:27:11,289
Bostonian? Of course I do, kid. We're so close. And then I can finally start playing. Are those

440
01:27:11,289 --> 01:27:37,989
lights? I don't know. AI controlled placement. It's right there. Come on. One more. Okay. This is

441
01:27:37,989 --> 01:27:49,369
almost done. Here we go. Look at that. One more little tick and that's it. I can probably just do

442
01:27:49,369 --> 01:28:13,899
it by cleaning. Oh hell yeah. Yeah. I can do it by cleaning for sure. Come on. It's right there.

443
01:28:13,899 --> 01:28:47,020
It's so close. Look at it. It's so dirty. It's definitely going to be it, right? Okay. Come on.

444
01:28:47,020 --> 01:29:01,979
Finish. Just finish. Destroy the walls. I knew it was going to be so loud. I just, I barely prepared

445
01:29:01,979 --> 01:29:13,539
for it. I realized what was happening before. There we go. Okay. Which wall do you want me to

446
01:29:13,539 --> 01:29:59,260
break? Build the walls. Okay. I turned this house into a hidden object game. They didn't even want

447
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:11,449
to show you the living room. That's too bad. You should play a hidden object game. I have. Okay.

448
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:27,239
Are you ready? Let's go. Here it is. Our cozy haven. Let's buy it. And I want to go there

449
01:30:27,239 --> 01:30:34,220
right now. Hey, remember all this shit that I just did? Hope you're ready to see it again.

450
01:30:37,460 --> 01:31:15,300
Why does my camera lag every time? All right. Actually, this is going to go much faster. What?

451
01:31:15,300 --> 01:32:10,569
I have to buy a new one? That was so much faster. That was so much faster. I'm so glad that I can

452
01:32:10,569 --> 01:32:28,420
do that. He's looking for a spy. Where is he? And I fly fucking forward. He backstabs me after all

453
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:49,539
this bullshit. I finally like get fucking stabbed. Have you seen the save TF2 thing? A little bit.

454
01:32:50,100 --> 01:33:01,130
A little bit. I'll give my take on it. I would love to see valve. The thing about TF2 is TF2

455
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:08,840
is an old game, right? But if there are official valve servers, if you're going to keep official

456
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:14,979
servers turned on, I think that they need to support the game somehow, right? And if there

457
01:33:14,979 --> 01:33:22,539
are official valve servers, valve servers, that means that they're still officially technically

458
01:33:22,539 --> 01:33:28,390
supporting the game. I would like to see some more updates to TF2. Forget about bug fixes or

459
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:32,949
problems with the game or whatever, right? But I would really like to see them at least sometimes

460
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:41,659
go in and just kind of fiddle with some knobs, right? That would be great. I don't know. I don't

461
01:33:41,659 --> 01:33:49,479
know. What is valve doing now? What is valve up to? What's like in the pipeline for valve?

462
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:58,390
Steam Deck? The game's currently unplayable right now. Yeah, I just think they kind of need to do

463
01:33:58,390 --> 01:34:07,020
something, right? So, I mean, I support anything to get and I love that game. I think the game's

464
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:13,239
as one as literally the reason why I'm sitting in this chair is because of that game. So absolutely,

465
01:34:13,239 --> 01:34:18,970
I support them coming in and fixing some of the problems that the game has, especially if they're

466
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:23,189
going to officially support it. But on top of that, I would, like I said, I'd like to see at

467
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:29,500
least something else or even, I mean, it's so easy to sit here and be like, I would love to do this.

468
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:34,439
They should do this. I want the pirate to do this. I want the heavy to get this. But even just small

469
01:34:34,439 --> 01:34:42,739
little fixes just to support the game. Will they do anything? I don't know. I don't know. I can't

470
01:34:42,739 --> 01:34:49,899
say that I would expect them to do very much, but it would be nice if they tried to do something

471
01:34:49,899 --> 01:35:01,670
with the game. But I don't think Valve is really in the business of video game making anymore.

472
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:07,750
Video game stuff. They're more hardware related and business related. Steam and their hardware

473
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:15,500
shit is, I think, when almost all their focus is completely 100%. I don't know if that's going to

474
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:21,260
change. I mean, obviously they're doing really, really well. Steam is the platform for pretty

475
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:26,380
much everything. So I don't know if they're ever going to get back into trying to do game stuff.

476
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:30,699
Will they actually come out with something besides? I mean, Alex came out a couple of years ago,

477
01:35:30,699 --> 01:35:38,149
right? But I don't know. The games that they have currently that they kind of are operating as a

478
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:46,069
service in a way. I mean, like Counter, they still, what about like CSGO? Dota 2 still gets updates.

479
01:35:46,069 --> 01:35:55,960
CSGO still gets updates, right? Doesn't, like, CSGO, yeah. Dota 2 is still really supported.

480
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:08,739
Yeah, I really do hope that they can at least support the games that they officially have,

481
01:36:08,739 --> 01:36:17,449
especially official servers for. I guess that's take on it, I guess. I mean, I love that game.

482
01:36:17,449 --> 01:36:22,970
I love everything about it. That's the huge reason why I am in the position I'm in today,

483
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:31,380
because I decided to make TF2 videos fucking 10 years ago. Without those games, I don't think I

484
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:37,819
would be sitting here. I really don't think so. Whatever happens, happens, I guess. And I guess

485
01:36:37,819 --> 01:36:45,640
hopefully they can come up with some kind of solution as I burn this whole fucking place to

486
01:36:45,640 --> 01:37:07,819
the ground. It should just let the game die. I mean, the hard part with that is if they want

487
01:37:07,819 --> 01:37:19,180
to just turn it off, then okay, turn it off then, right? If you want to turn the game off,

488
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:25,380
and that's it, we're not supporting servers anymore, then at least give some closure to everybody.

489
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:29,460
As much as I don't want to see that happen, right? It's almost like, give us some closure.

490
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:34,810
Give everybody closure. And oh, hey, look, we're not doing official supported servers anymore.

491
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:38,489
We're our focus is in other places. But by all means, if you want to run community servers,

492
01:37:38,489 --> 01:37:43,579
blah, blah, blah, right? But if you want to pull the plug officially on it, then you got to do it.

493
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:50,550
Like, well, closure for what? Closure just for, I think people expect, or not expect, but people

494
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:54,869
really want them to be involved, to help and do things and fix things and stuff. But if they

495
01:37:54,869 --> 01:38:03,399
don't want to, and there's been no real, I guess, communication to do so, then I don't know, right?

496
01:38:03,399 --> 01:38:15,739
Like, I don't know what their plans or goals are long term, but we'll see. TF2 is the blueprint.

497
01:38:15,739 --> 01:38:21,899
You've been walking in circles for 10 minutes. Yeah, go watch my Minecraft video. My Minecraft

498
01:38:21,899 --> 01:38:27,989
videos where I went like this and talked about like what happened at my house today. I literally

499
01:38:27,989 --> 01:38:34,619
went like this before, I think three or four hours going like this. And when it was brought

500
01:38:34,619 --> 01:38:38,260
to my attention, I was going to, I think I was going to delete the video because I was embarrassed.

501
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:46,489
I was like, holy fuck, what am I doing? I remember MLC Stealth told me long time ago, he said, dude,

502
01:38:46,489 --> 01:38:54,460
I watched your Minecraft video and you built and took down the same wall for about 12 minutes

503
01:38:54,460 --> 01:39:00,520
straight. It was, you did it like 15 times. So I just, my brain just gets, when I have talking,

504
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:11,000
I can't fucking do anything. All right, let's go. I don't want to buy any, I'm going to buy shit

505
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:26,630
little fuel, but I will leave you with this. I do not really play TF2 anymore. I don't, I'm not really,

506
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:33,800
I'm not into it anymore, but if you are, then I really hope that some kind of solution can happen

507
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:38,710
because it's a great game. It's a fucking fantastic game. It's one of the best FPSs to ever release.

508
01:39:38,710 --> 01:40:12,729
So time for Smite Sundays. Time for Omega Lull Overwatch Wednesdays. No, I'm not, I'm, no.

509
01:40:13,529 --> 01:40:42,119
Think of all the bugs in the grass you are killing right now. I'm just trying to get to square one.

510
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:47,590
Bug killer. Oh, stop. I'm not, I'm not killing bugs. I checked, I checked before I started

511
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:52,949
because there's going to be, it's going to be stuff out here, animal stuff. I got, it's got to be clean.

512
01:41:53,590 --> 01:42:38,300
Holy shit. That hurt my chest. That's good enough for now. All right, let's clean. Hey, I, come on.

513
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:42,779
I was the, I was the master at being able to fake sick so I didn't have to go to school.

514
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:55,210
I feel, I just like feel terrible. Oh fuck. Oh, you don't feel good? No, I can't go to school.

515
01:43:06,489 --> 01:43:20,810
You said fuck to your mom. No, I'm just saying I was, oh fuck. Oh fucking. So as you see here,

516
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:30,539
this theory of the triangle and the circle, the Pythagorean theorem is fucking, it's got the angle

517
01:43:30,539 --> 01:43:35,109
in the middle here you had to solve for that is. Remember that joke? That was a good one.

518
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:54,659
I'm going to put new windows on. Don't worry. I need to clean. I remember that. Yeah. So I don't

519
01:43:54,659 --> 01:44:15,060
have any more water. Where's the, where's my water? Where's, where's water? Excuse me. This,

520
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:22,020
I got to change this outside as well. You should play that. Play where's my water. What are you

521
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:52,470
fucking an iPad gamer from 2012? What are you talking about? Play iPad games. You know what

522
01:44:52,470 --> 01:45:00,060
I wanted to do? I wanted to watch a shitload of mobile ads, but we're going to have to do that

523
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:07,750
in really small doses because they are insane. I don't think we could do that for three hours.

524
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:19,640
I think we would all have, it would make us sick as an avid iPad game connoisseur. Let me tell you

525
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:25,380
that some of the most ridiculous, insane bullshit that I've ever seen in my whole life happened

526
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:36,710
while I was watching an iPad game ad or a phone ad. You want to talk about a computer generating

527
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:46,090
random shit? This is it. But some of them are so goddamn funny. They're so funny that I think it

528
01:45:46,090 --> 01:46:17,560
deserves a stream night. Okay. I always get it. What's that? Oh, that's a bugs. Didn't I just

529
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:40,659
burn this whole room? I thought I burnt this room. Why is there blood? I don't think it's blood.

530
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:52,899
I think it's rust or something. All right. This looks fine. I'm now look, I'd look at the passion

531
01:46:52,899 --> 01:47:20,199
here. You see, see the passion here. There's no natural light. I'm going to put windows in.

532
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:37,130
First of all. Nope. Don't want one of those in the house. Front door. Okay. This is the front door.

533
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:48,949
Well, that's the side door. Yeah. All of this wood needs to change. Yeah. This all this looks

534
01:47:48,949 --> 01:47:58,979
artable ceiling fan phobia. I really do with that. They're weird. I don't really don't like them.

535
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:23,899
They're weird. No, we're doing it from scratch. We're building this house from scratch. All right.

536
01:48:23,899 --> 01:48:27,100
How do I want this to play out here? Let's pray. All right. Take all these walls down.

537
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:55,739
We're building the house from scratch. Where's the dog? I think at the other house.

538
01:48:55,739 --> 01:49:02,149
Holy shit. That was inside of my head. This is a load bearing wall.

539
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:22,579
Jerry. These are load bearing walls. Whoa. Have you doing a Seinfeld thing where they build a

540
01:49:22,579 --> 01:49:35,060
house or something? I feel like that. Wait, didn't this happen in Drake and Josh? No,

541
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:41,510
it's a load bearing wall, Josh. How was I supposed to? They really are Jerry and fucking George.

542
01:49:48,819 --> 01:50:00,020
What the fuck? I'm just realizing this right now. How was I supposed to know that a door was

543
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:07,420
supposed to be there, Josh? No, other one. Other way around. There's supposed to be a door over

544
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:36,680
there. That's George. Holy shit. Damn. Okay. He knows too much. I want another Seinfeld episode.

545
01:50:40,069 --> 01:50:47,880
You know what I was thinking? In a hundred years, will I know that, okay, like media has a tendency

546
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:54,199
to kind of repeat itself, right? Are we going to see in 50 to a hundred years, just Seinfeld,

547
01:50:54,199 --> 01:51:03,079
but it's they just kind of redoing it. Will there be a Breaking Bad remake in 50 years?

548
01:51:03,079 --> 01:51:22,060
Do you think so? I wonder. I'm actually genuinely curious about that. All the most popular media

549
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:29,430
right now, will they redo it? I mean, Seinfeld ended 20 years ago though. I think, I don't know.

550
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:38,470
Maybe like another 50 years, but would they call it Seinfeld and just have some guy that's not

551
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:55,210
Jerry Seinfeld just be pretending to be Jerry Seinfeld. They're just going to call it Jerry.

552
01:51:55,210 --> 01:52:20,979
Okay. I want this. I want, trust me when I say, why are you taking all the rooms out? I'm not.

553
01:52:20,979 --> 01:52:27,510
When are you going to get remade? See, I'm a, well, see I'm doing all of Jim Carrey's

554
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:45,689
sound effects. So like I already am a remake. You know what I mean? Like I am essentially a three

555
01:52:45,689 --> 01:52:55,239
stoge stooges. Why can't I, I can't talk when loud sounds are exploding in my head. I mean,

556
01:52:55,239 --> 01:53:01,079
I'm sort of, I am like one of the stooges or all of them combined maybe. Sometimes I feel like Moa.

557
01:53:01,079 --> 01:53:11,819
Sometimes I feel like, like, not Gary, Curly. Sometimes I wake up and feel like one of the

558
01:53:11,819 --> 01:53:42,949
stooges each day. Each day. I prefer, I prefer the remake. You're the fourth stooges. Okay. So

559
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:51,399
let's get rid of this. I need some light in here because this is what, where even am I?

560
01:53:51,399 --> 01:54:02,890
Where's the door? Oh no. Drake, you forgot to put the door on. Where, actually, where's the door?

561
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:25,239
Oh, I fucking deleted it. Right. I forgot. Where are the stairs? Where is there a door? Okay. This

562
01:54:25,239 --> 01:54:59,130
is temporary. Where did it go? Oh, what? What the fuck just happened? Oh my goodness. Somebody

563
01:54:59,130 --> 01:55:08,140
punched me in the face. I got punched in the face. Why is it fucking Walgreens now?

564
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:21,109
All right. Just whatever. I am very, very stunned right now. That just stunned me. That was, that

565
01:55:21,109 --> 01:55:31,479
actually stunned me. I hope everyone's all right. Let's get some lights in here. Jesus. What the

566
01:55:31,479 --> 01:55:57,130
fuck? Why is caps lock on? Oh, okay. I just need a light. Pools? No. What the fuck is this? Stop.

567
01:55:57,130 --> 01:56:08,010
I'm concussed. Here we go. Just temporary. Just to get light in here. Where's the light switch?

568
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:28,789
Turn it on. There we go. Now I can see. All right. Let's get, let's keep going. I don't know where I

569
01:56:28,789 --> 01:56:46,420
want the bathrooms yet. We'll get that figured out. Relax. I am getting blocked by this, aren't I?

570
01:56:46,420 --> 01:57:13,720
It's all right. All right. I hope this doesn't explode anymore. Okay. I cannot take this wall

571
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:20,300
down. This is, this is a load bearing wall. You're ruining your house. I am not even beginning it.

572
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:43,420
I have not even started. Okay. Good beginning. Um, clean. Let's get this situated. Clean this shit

573
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:58,699
up. Let's make this look like, uh, less of a haunted house and more of a animal sanctuary.

574
01:57:58,699 --> 01:58:08,439
Animal, uh, foster home or something, right? Or to that. Okay. Get rid of that and get rid of this

575
01:58:08,439 --> 01:58:17,939
and get rid of these. I don't want that. All right. What? This is down to the other floor. Okay.

576
01:58:17,939 --> 01:58:25,159
We're going to keep, should we get the bugs downstairs? I want, where should the bugs be?

577
01:58:25,159 --> 01:58:32,199
Where should I put all the bugs? All right. We'll do the bugs later. First of all, I need a bedroom.

578
01:58:32,199 --> 01:58:38,520
So we're going to have the bedroom be, this is the front door. Is this the front door? Where the hell

579
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:49,829
am I? This is the, okay. This is where the front door is supposed to be. Right here. I'll take care

580
01:58:49,829 --> 01:59:09,220
of that right now. Turn your, turn your sound down. Same shit's going to happen. Turn your sound down.

581
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:33,189
I mean it. Thank God I did that. Thank God. That was almost a disaster. There's the front door.

582
01:59:33,189 --> 01:59:38,069
It's temporary. Don't worry. Everyone calling me a shitty front door Andy. I've seen those comments

583
01:59:38,069 --> 02:00:14,869
and I, this is greasy. I can't fix it. That's really greasy. Is it still greasy? This shit is

584
02:00:14,869 --> 02:00:32,649
greasy. All right. Let's clean. I know. Every time these steaks, they're not greasy. And just

585
02:00:32,649 --> 02:00:49,750
right when you go to the pizza shop, be careful. The pizza's greasy. How fast can you do that?

586
02:00:49,750 --> 02:01:15,140
Fuck out of here. No one can compare. Not one person. Dominate that market. Okay. Let's do it.

587
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:23,500
I need to figure out where I want to put my room. There's no upstairs. I think my, so this is the

588
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:30,170
front door. That's the, technically the back door. That could be like a little living room area. This

589
02:01:30,170 --> 02:01:37,659
front door. You come in, maybe like right over here. I'm going to say I want my bedroom to be

590
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:47,479
right here. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, right here. Yeah. I think that's a good

591
02:01:47,479 --> 02:01:55,939
idea. So let's say from here we can, I don't know, we can just put like a fucking weird clock here or

592
02:01:55,939 --> 02:02:53,500
something, right? This is the front door. I don't, okay. This is the front door. Bedroom is going to

593
02:02:53,500 --> 02:03:22,819
be right here. Right here. That looks good to me. Right there. Make a little hallway. Shut up. I'm

594
02:03:22,819 --> 02:03:47,270
working on it. So you come in. This is a little hallway. There'll be a little, uh, maybe a closet

595
02:03:47,270 --> 02:04:09,060
right here. Um, but should I have the bed, yeah, the bedroom entrance be here or right here? I feel

596
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:11,939
like the door being right there would be weird, wouldn't it? This is kind of a hallway. Then this

597
02:04:11,939 --> 02:04:19,079
can be the entrance right here. Yeah. I think that makes more sense. Yeah, that makes more sense.

598
02:04:19,079 --> 02:04:36,420
Looks good. Put a window in there. Yeah, I will. This is fine for a bedroom. Look, I didn't, I just

599
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:40,739
need to sleep and wake up and have a light and have like a painting and that's it. I don't care

600
02:04:40,739 --> 02:04:54,949
about anything else. I need a bedroom door. Ooh. What's a decent door for the bedroom? These

601
02:04:54,949 --> 02:05:16,699
refrigerators? Okay. This is fine. What color should the door be? Um, how about like a beige?

602
02:05:16,699 --> 02:05:43,539
Maybe like a birch? These are front doors. Oh my God. Does it really matter though? Luxury? Pets.

603
02:05:43,539 --> 02:05:52,600
These are the new ones. Let's get some new ones. Okay. Interior door. Here you go. This one looks

604
02:05:52,600 --> 02:06:19,380
fine. Maybe like a nice, um, like a nice cedar. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Uh, please. Thank you.

605
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:33,779
Looks good. Now we have to build the little things up here. This game is so relaxing. Where's the

606
02:06:33,779 --> 02:06:42,310
passion? I, you don't see the passion in my voice right here. I'm working on it. This is just,

607
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:49,960
I want a ton of room for the animals. No window. Yeah. God, I get it. I got to be at lightning

608
02:06:49,960 --> 02:07:13,260
speed apparently. Where's the bed going to go? We'll do like one here and one. Okay. There's the

609
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:25,239
window. Put two windows in here. There it is. Nice. All right. That looks fine. The walls aren't

610
02:07:25,239 --> 02:07:30,699
going to look like this. Don't worry. In fact, let's figure that out now. Let me get some good,

611
02:07:30,699 --> 02:07:54,489
good, good lighting, lights. Although I should probably have some cool stuff in here. Why are

612
02:07:54,489 --> 02:08:01,739
the walls two feet thick? Because that's the way they made the game. Okay. I didn't do that.

613
02:08:05,029 --> 02:08:47,420
Should I have some weird shit? Oh, this thing look cool. That's fine. Get a dog. I need to

614
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:52,869
have this place be available. I need to be okay to have a dog or a cat or a rabbit or a horse

615
02:08:52,869 --> 02:08:57,430
or a tarantula or an iguana. I'm not just going to bring them in here. It's dangerous.

616
02:08:57,430 --> 02:09:03,239
It's really off center. I just need the light. All right. Floor. Carpet. Definitely carpets.

617
02:09:03,239 --> 02:09:27,460
Ooh. How's this look? Looks nice. I like carpets. I like carpets up in a bedroom. I like carpets down

618
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:32,439
in the bedroom. I like in a bedroom. I don't know how many times I have to say that for you to get

619
02:09:32,439 --> 02:09:43,100
it. It's comfortable. It feels nice on your feet. It gets really nice and warm and stuff. I don't

620
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:49,880
get this carpet hatred that everybody seems to have. All right. Walls. What do I want this to be?

621
02:09:49,880 --> 02:10:06,229
I don't care. My bedroom is small. I want more room for the animals. Yeah. Really? I'm not going

622
02:10:06,229 --> 02:10:33,859
to do that. Cool. But wait. Check this out. People are going to be very... No. I'm not going to burn

623
02:10:33,859 --> 02:11:03,260
it down. He's making a pet sanctuary. That's what I'm doing. That's the pet DLC. Of course,

624
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:08,199
I'm going to make a big pet sanctuary. What do you got? Do you mind? Here's the design.

625
02:11:08,199 --> 02:11:21,239
This is where the design comes in. Watch this. Check this out, everybody. Okay. Watch this.

626
02:11:21,239 --> 02:11:51,739
Here we go. There we go. Now it looks like an old Nickelodeon ad. It doesn't work. Oh, I hate it.

627
02:11:51,739 --> 02:11:59,210
Just an accent wall. Okay. I'll do... Yeah. Something else. I hate it. Let's do paint.

628
02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:03,500
We'll keep that as the accent wall, though. What should I paint it? Crystal? The Milky Way?

629
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:34,020
Let's try the Milky Way. Is it ugly? Too plain? It's a little too plain. Yeah, too plain. I don't

630
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:45,000
want to go too crazy, though. How about morning celadon? Fresh morning. Fresh morning would

631
02:12:45,000 --> 02:13:05,029
probably be good here. Let's test it. I like it. I think it goes with the accent. Oh, yeah,

632
02:13:05,029 --> 02:13:29,909
this will work fine. Yeah, for sure. It's the same thing. It's not the same thing. That's not...

633
02:13:29,909 --> 02:13:36,680
Look at it under the light. That's not the same thing. This is way nicer. I am a shadow in the

634
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:57,850
dark, okay? I need to... Hold on a second. Hi. You can see me again. This is different and it

635
02:13:57,850 --> 02:14:26,840
looks much better. There we go. All right. Yeah. Much, much better. It's just gray. I'm going to

636
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:33,819
change the carpet, so it's not so boring, but I'm very boring. I swear to God. People think I

637
02:14:33,819 --> 02:14:38,939
might be making this up. Like, oh man, I bet you he has really crazy taste. I bet you have wicked

638
02:14:38,939 --> 02:14:44,119
expensive taste and shit. He probably has a chandelier in his house. Guys, I would be so

639
02:14:44,119 --> 02:14:52,460
happy. At my most happiness. Just sitting in a bedroom that just has a bed, a table, and a lamp

640
02:14:52,460 --> 02:15:00,859
on it. I don't care. That's at my most happy. I don't want a bunch of shit in the way. I don't

641
02:15:00,859 --> 02:15:09,460
want a bunch of stuff everywhere. All I need is, yeah, I need my iPad sitting here on my chest,

642
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:33,140
a bed, a light, and good company. This door looks like shit. You're an iPad kid. No, I'm not an iPad

643
02:15:33,140 --> 02:16:02,380
kid. Sometimes Holly will take a funny picture because I fall asleep a lot when I'm with my iPad

644
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:26,359
on my chest. In the pictures I'm about to show you, I am asleep. Asleep. One of these in particular

645
02:16:26,359 --> 02:16:43,670
is really funny. This happens all the fucking time. I just sit there. I have this little thing

646
02:16:43,670 --> 02:16:58,309
that sits on my chest. Let's go through a couple of these. Maybe one or two of them. Okay, hold on.

647
02:16:58,309 --> 02:17:13,239
Let me make sure I can get this on the screen. So this is a picture of me. This is the kind,

648
02:17:13,239 --> 02:17:25,639
I don't know what I was even watching. Auto play just takes over, guys. A lot of the time. Okay,

649
02:17:25,639 --> 02:17:35,139
that's me asleep. Be aware of that. I am asleep. And apparently I'm watching free money to quit

650
02:17:35,139 --> 02:17:50,010
your job. I don't know where this came from. Getting rich on government money. I was sleeping.

651
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:54,329
It gets better though. It does get better. I promise that this does get a little better,

652
02:17:54,329 --> 02:18:08,700
and I'm going to show you another one. Don't be, don't, nobody freak out about this, okay?

653
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:30,090
But I just have, it's too funny to not show. It really is too funny to not show this. This is,

654
02:18:46,040 --> 02:19:03,420
and I, I just fall asleep to stuff and I watch stuff. It could be anything. There's more.

655
02:19:04,069 --> 02:19:20,280
There's more. There's more of these. There's one of, here's the other one. I think this is from the

656
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:31,270
same video, but it's just funny. Guys, I'm telling you, I will fall asleep to shit and just, it'll be

657
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:37,639
on for six hours and I'll, I will absorb it. I've fallen asleep to six hours. I, oh my God,

658
02:19:37,639 --> 02:19:44,500
what a perfect opportunity to talk about this. So today, what I fell asleep to as an iPad kid Andy,

659
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:51,780
I fell asleep to, I don't know, was a food eating video? One of those videos of people eating food

660
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:59,209
and I, I guess I fell asleep and I woke, I kind of woke up because Otto was in the bed and I heard

661
02:19:59,209 --> 02:20:05,579
like crunching shit and I'm like, Otto's eating something. What's he eating? No, he's not. What's

662
02:20:05,579 --> 02:20:09,819
he getting into? And I open my eyes and look at the dog and he's fine. He's just sitting there sleeping

663
02:20:09,819 --> 02:20:18,440
and the audio stopped. There were no more eating sounds. So I was like, what the fuck was that? I

664
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:25,620
must've been having like a weird dream. So I didn't care and I went back to bed and I heard it again.

665
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:29,620
I heard this crazy eating sounds and I'm like, Otto's getting into like the trash.

666
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:33,860
What's happening? And no, it was over here. The iPad was on the other end of the bed,

667
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:44,139
just Otto playing shit. And I kept thinking it was Otto eating food in the bed. It had to have been

668
02:20:44,139 --> 02:20:48,700
going on for at least four or five hours because it was dark when it happened the first time and

669
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:54,540
the sun was shining the second time. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I don't know what

670
02:20:54,540 --> 02:21:03,299
I, what's, I don't know why I keep doing this, but it doesn't matter. It could be anything.

671
02:21:03,299 --> 02:21:13,530
The YouTube recommendation autoplay is terrible. Here's another one. We'll do this last one.

672
02:21:21,049 --> 02:21:35,819
I think this is from the quit your job for money thing. By the way, if you want to know who that

673
02:21:35,819 --> 02:21:42,420
is, that's, that's Matthew Lesko, who he's actually like a really, really nice guy. Really, really

674
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:47,219
like awesome, awesome dude. Really just wanted to like help people and shit. He is a great person.

675
02:21:47,219 --> 02:21:51,620
That little documentary that Vice did is wonderful. I really recommend you watch it. I've seen it.

676
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:57,110
I didn't fall asleep to it. I've seen it. It's he's actually, it was actually a really,

677
02:21:57,110 --> 02:22:10,180
really good guy. All right. You have broken neck. No, I don't. I'm propped up on a pillow.

678
02:22:14,950 --> 02:22:29,379
I'm propped up on a pillow, man. I'm, that's not a TV. There's an iPad. You have streamer neck in

679
02:22:29,379 --> 02:22:39,129
your sleep. Sometimes though that's dangerous because I will be like this and I'll move a

680
02:22:39,129 --> 02:22:44,649
certain way and the iPad will go and start falling down and I'll feel it. And I'll be like,

681
02:22:46,010 --> 02:22:52,420
I'll grab it and okay. And then I leave it there and I go back to bed. It's move it. Just move it

682
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:59,059
off of your fucking body. I do that three or four times a night. I almost get smashed in the mouth

683
02:22:59,059 --> 02:23:06,700
by my iPad and I don't care. I put it right back where it was. One of these days it's going to

684
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:26,700
knock out one of my front teeth. Anyways, this is too funny. I could, I had to share it.

685
02:23:26,780 --> 02:23:56,020
Ceiling is still wood. I'm working on it. Okay. So it's, is this real? Is this a,

686
02:23:56,020 --> 02:24:06,739
Holly? Is this real? Is this a real one? Is this real? I don't think this is,

687
02:24:06,739 --> 02:24:13,260
did I fall asleep to this? I might've. I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know.

688
02:24:14,790 --> 02:24:34,379
I truly don't know. Why is this image so huge? What the fuck? Where is it? I'm so confused.

689
02:24:36,979 --> 02:24:45,450
Oh, there we go. Okay. I may, I might've, I actually might've. This is, this could be a real

690
02:24:45,450 --> 02:24:55,799
photo. I really probably did. Oh, it's not real. It could be. I, I, it actually could be. This is

691
02:24:55,799 --> 02:25:00,299
no way. That's edited. It's fake. Okay. But it's definitely real because I've definitely

692
02:25:00,299 --> 02:25:06,940
fallen asleep to watching that video. I'm not even kidding. Like I sometimes it was like eating

693
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:11,739
videos and he's like, watch one. I go, whoa, what this, whoa. And then I just,

694
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:30,229
and they all play. It's real. I'm serious. I don't know. I, I'm very weird when it comes to media

695
02:25:30,229 --> 02:25:34,700
and consuming media. A lot of people probably like, dude, what the fuck? Why are you doing that?

696
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:41,159
What's wrong with you? I don't know. I like watching odd media, just like interesting stuff.

697
02:25:41,159 --> 02:25:48,120
I don't watch TV shows. I watched four straight hours of ASMR eating videos. I don't, I just,

698
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:52,100
because, because it's interesting. It's very, it's fascinating. It's interesting to me.

699
02:25:52,100 --> 02:25:59,620
It's interesting. I will watch like four hours of log cutting videos. It's just, it's fascinating

700
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:06,440
somehow. It's very interesting. You know what I'm saying? It's ADHD that's doing it. It probably,

701
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:20,139
it could be. It actually could be. All right. Can I paint the ceiling please? I think it can

702
02:26:20,139 --> 02:26:32,760
just be this. This is fine. Now you could paint a wall. Good. Is this the wrong color? No. Is

703
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:42,389
this too weird looking? I can't tell. I love doing interior car cleaning videos. Yeah. You

704
02:26:42,389 --> 02:26:50,920
don't have to watch, you know, oh, the new season of Breaking Bad or whatever. We're just,

705
02:26:50,920 --> 02:27:00,729
I like watching random shit. I will watch old commercials. It's interesting. Really old

706
02:27:00,729 --> 02:27:10,280
commercials. I'm happy with this room. I'm done with it. Okay. Now I need a bathroom,

707
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:27,129
which would be right here. You missed a spot. I can go to finishing touches later. Bathroom

708
02:27:27,129 --> 02:27:35,690
can be here. Ooh, the door is going to be close, isn't it? It's fine. Change the weird door.

709
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:54,409
It is a fucking weird door. I know you're right. That is a weird door. Maybe I could just have

710
02:27:54,409 --> 02:28:08,739
like an open concept here. It's probably, it's got to be here instead. Right there. There it is.

711
02:28:08,739 --> 02:28:14,180
Okay. So the bathroom's right here. Open concept into a bedroom. I don't know. It's just going to

712
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:21,020
be, it's going to be me and all my dogs and lizards and shit. I think right, right there

713
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:29,049
should be fine. That should be fine right here, I think. What does your YouTube recommended look

714
02:28:29,049 --> 02:28:38,379
like? It's a, it's crazy. I actually have to go in and delete all of my search history and watch

715
02:28:38,379 --> 02:28:44,940
history because eventually it gets to be fucking nightmares. It's just crazy, the recommendations

716
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:56,440
I get. If I don't reset it, it's just all over the place. Just wild, wild shit from every genre.

717
02:28:56,440 --> 02:29:05,459
YouTube is fundamentally broken. Show us your YouTube. I'm not, you want to see my YouTube

718
02:29:05,459 --> 02:29:21,860
searches? Let me screen that first. I'll screen that first. Show us. I don't have to show you

719
02:29:21,860 --> 02:29:32,180
anything. You need to show us right now. No, I don't have to show you. I don't, I don't know.

720
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:37,000
I don't know if you guys know what videos I've watched. It's freaking me out because I'm not

721
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:42,600
embarrassed by like something weird showing up. I'm embarrassed by the volume of eating videos

722
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:48,579
that are going to be there. And I, that's kind of, I don't, I don't know if I like that. The volume

723
02:29:48,579 --> 02:29:54,709
of like people eating or like drinking liquids really fast. It's going to be, it's going to be

724
02:29:54,709 --> 02:30:11,770
predominantly there. I'm done. I'm done. Thanks for participating. We're going to move on.

725
02:30:11,770 --> 02:30:16,409
We won't judge you. Oh, please. That's, you guys are in the game. You guys are in the business

726
02:30:16,409 --> 02:30:22,100
of judging me. You guys, that's what you are here for. That's, you are in the business of judging me,

727
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:31,819
especially with things like this. Maybe I'll do it. I'll go look and see if it's like weird.

728
02:30:31,819 --> 02:30:39,829
Not today though. Maybe like on Friday. Nah, give me a new door because I have to get my

729
02:30:39,829 --> 02:30:45,829
iPads like not fucking, no, my iPads are not even charged. It's no, not going to happen. You'll see

730
02:30:45,829 --> 02:31:02,299
maybe on Friday. If I, you know, decided to do that. Nothing to hide, nothing to fear. We'll see

731
02:31:02,299 --> 02:31:33,620
on Friday. We'll, we'll see if I do it. I'm watching this on my iPad. No, you're just going

732
02:31:33,620 --> 02:31:40,420
to watch normal videos on Thursday. You will know if it's full of shit, if it's regular ass videos.

733
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:48,040
Okay. I just told you the, all the fucking stuff that I watch. And if on Friday I'm like, hey,

734
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:52,920
take a look at my YouTube recommended. Yeah, it's normal. See, it's like, oh, how to build a

735
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:59,879
birdhouse and, oh, top 10 Marvel characters who you could be like, you're going to be like full of

736
02:31:59,879 --> 02:32:08,629
shit. You guys know what I was looking at. So I can't hide that. Yeah. If my recommended is like,

737
02:32:10,329 --> 02:32:15,129
but I don't know why you'd even want this. Oh, the end of far from home explained.

738
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:34,149
You would know that I, I'm full of shit. There's going to be a lot of infomercials. Do liked videos.

739
02:32:34,149 --> 02:32:42,389
I don't, I don't do that. I just let the automatic recommend to just throw up into my face. I don't

740
02:32:42,389 --> 02:32:48,170
do, I don't like videos. I don't save them. I don't bookmark them. I just watch. I just pick

741
02:32:48,170 --> 02:32:54,899
a random one and just go and just go for like four hours. I've never liked a video. I don't think

742
02:32:54,899 --> 02:32:58,899
since like, maybe like, I don't know. God damn fucking decade ago. I have no idea. I don't think

743
02:32:58,899 --> 02:33:08,520
I even did. He hates videos. I don't, I just don't. Okay. Please, we need to get a door in here.

744
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:18,520
You're fucking with me. It's going to be like Kathy Mitchell, Express 101, Kathy Mitchell,

745
02:33:18,520 --> 02:33:26,219
the turbo cooker, Kathy Mitchell, the snack master, Kathy Mitchell, infomercial,

746
02:33:26,219 --> 02:33:38,299
Kathy Murch Mitchell, infomercial, long version. I swear Kathy Mitchell, DVD turbo cooker,

747
02:33:38,299 --> 02:33:43,420
because it was like three hours and it's her just doing recipes for the turbo cooker.

748
02:33:43,420 --> 02:33:53,159
It's not the infomercial. They go, I just read you the last, I read you the last six. I'm never

749
02:33:53,159 --> 02:33:59,370
going to get this house done. Thanks a lot. All right. These, these doors were too weird.

750
02:33:59,370 --> 02:34:12,860
So give me a normal one. Just a regular interior door. Just a regular ass door. Just a regular

751
02:34:12,860 --> 02:34:47,639
interior. There's a ton of stuff in mod chat right now. Oh God. I'm never going to finish

752
02:34:47,639 --> 02:35:02,090
this house. I don't know. Why am I, what is this from? What the fuck is this? When did I do this?

753
02:35:02,090 --> 02:35:15,430
Huh? Why am I naked? When did I do that? What the fuck is this? What is this from? Why am I nude?

754
02:35:15,430 --> 02:35:49,610
Why would I be watching this? I don't know. Somebody said, why are your nipples so high?

755
02:35:49,610 --> 02:35:59,799
I need to investigate. Hold on. I need to investigate this. I need this to be investigated.

756
02:35:59,799 --> 02:36:15,739
This is so confusing. Yeah. What the fuck? Like up here. That doesn't look right. That doesn't look

757
02:36:15,739 --> 02:36:40,680
right. Where's your mic? Dude, I, uh, look at how, oh my God. Why would I be watching this?

758
02:36:40,680 --> 02:36:49,319
There's so many of these. I will never be able to get through them. No. All right. You, you know,

759
02:36:49,319 --> 02:37:01,659
go to the, the, the sub stream is doing a whole lot of shit. Go check it out. It's funny. There's

760
02:37:01,659 --> 02:37:06,620
going to be watching baby sensory videos. Me watching what I am that. I'm assuming it's like

761
02:37:06,700 --> 02:37:17,979
porn or something. There's me watching this stream. Top 10 son. No, I don't, I don't know.

762
02:37:17,979 --> 02:37:28,139
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's go. Let's go. I'm out.

763
02:37:28,139 --> 02:37:46,149
That was a lot of fun. Thanks for participating. I don't care. It doesn't matter what this door is.

764
02:37:46,149 --> 02:37:51,750
I don't care. Let me just finish the fucking house already. I knocked down five walls. Stop

765
02:37:51,750 --> 02:37:56,729
you. Bring me back to my Minecraft days. It's been three hours. I'll fix it later. I need to

766
02:37:56,729 --> 02:38:18,100
put animals in here. This is a mouth like you want. This is the one everyone's talking about.

767
02:38:18,100 --> 02:38:45,510
I don't why would I be fucking watching this? You don't have to show it. Oh God. No. All right.

768
02:38:45,510 --> 02:38:50,969
I'm knocking this wall down right now and nothing's going to stop me. Nothing's going to stop me.

769
02:38:50,969 --> 02:38:57,959
I'm knocking this wall down. Nothing is going to stop me. I'm a 36 year old man. Let's relax.

770
02:38:57,959 --> 02:39:12,760
I'm a 36 year old man. It's time for you to start acting like one. That was so loud. Why is it? Why

771
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:26,020
did this get louder? How did this get even louder? I don't know how that got so loud. Okay. So let's

772
02:39:26,020 --> 02:39:39,260
continue. This is going to be the bathroom very quickly, very quickly. Let's get it done. Let's

773
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:56,569
get it done. Bathroom right here. It's fine. It doesn't need to be big. I just need it to exist.

774
02:39:56,569 --> 02:40:22,469
I don't care. I'm not going to watch the video right now. Give it a rest. Okay. This goes to the

775
02:40:22,469 --> 02:40:35,500
bedroom. This is going to go to the bathroom right here. There it is. Excellent. Looking good. It's

776
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:41,239
a small bathroom, but it doesn't need to be large. This needs to be small enough, big enough to

777
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:45,559
go in there and do whatever you need to do. And then here we go. This is where the iguana

778
02:40:45,559 --> 02:40:57,000
is going to live. The doors can be replaced later. I don't care if they're ugly. They just have to

779
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:07,610
exist. I don't care. Oh, my eyes are so irritated. Why are my eyes so irritated? There's just a lot

780
02:41:07,610 --> 02:41:17,590
of irritation right now. It's good. Yeah, it looks fine. All right. Speaking of in the bathroom,

781
02:41:17,590 --> 02:41:30,440
my eyes are so itchy. All right. I need floors. We'll do the walls first. Well, it's a nice

782
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:36,520
bathroom one. How about, I don't know, green? Let's go. Let's get wild with it. Let's get wild

783
02:41:36,520 --> 02:42:13,930
with it, right? Why not? Should we get wild with it? Green? Let's get wild with it. All right. This

784
02:42:13,930 --> 02:42:30,540
is some Wizard of Oz munchkin land shit. Should I leave it? Oh, Emerald City. That's what I was

785
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:36,120
thinking of. Well, wasn't it munchkin land as well? It was all that green, wasn't it? Emerald City,

786
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:49,959
not munchkin land. It's a Yoda bathroom. I think it should be. If I put this, whatever,

787
02:42:49,959 --> 02:43:09,819
I'm sticking with it. I second guess too much. Okay. We need some, you know what I'm saying?

788
02:43:09,819 --> 02:43:21,979
We need, we need floors. Floor and ceiling tiles. How about this one? I've got to brighten it up a

789
02:43:21,979 --> 02:43:34,780
little. Okay. Let's make this a little nicer looking. The ceiling should be, let's just make

790
02:43:34,780 --> 02:44:03,690
it white. Put some nice lights in here too. Okay. Get rid of that. We need some nice bathroom

791
02:44:03,690 --> 02:44:12,870
lights. It's a green screen room. Lights. Something nice. Something really nice. Really brighten it

792
02:44:12,870 --> 02:44:25,579
up too. I need something to brighten it up. I actually, these would be all right. These are

793
02:44:25,579 --> 02:45:01,159
nice and clean. Yeah. These are clean. Yeah. These are clean. Those are clean. There are no fire

794
02:45:01,159 --> 02:45:17,590
escapes. Just wait. Why? What do you mean fire escape? Oh dude, our jacuzzi is definitely going

795
02:45:17,590 --> 02:45:25,399
back there somewhere. I don't know. No windows in the bathroom. No. I don't want that. Zero. No

796
02:45:25,399 --> 02:45:30,280
windows in my fucking bathroom. I don't want a window in the bathroom. What? So the window

797
02:45:30,280 --> 02:45:35,959
in the curtains can be closed permanently and never ever opened ever for any reason ever.

798
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:42,040
Never opened. Why would I want a bathroom window? What are you talking about? Ever. You want me to

799
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:51,290
put a window here for it to permanently be closed and never have the curtains opened ever. I don't

800
02:45:51,290 --> 02:46:00,389
like that. I don't like that. Maybe you'd get a frosted window. They have them. They don't have

801
02:46:00,389 --> 02:46:26,409
frosted windows. Yeah. No. Fuck that. Fuck this. Yeah. Fuck this. Why would you want a window here?

802
02:46:26,409 --> 02:46:57,180
I don't want a window in my bathroom. Loud. Careful. Yeah. I don't like that. I don't like

803
02:46:57,180 --> 02:47:07,260
this shit, but whatever. Get some air in here. Why is my eye so itchy? It's fucking making me

804
02:47:07,260 --> 02:47:21,430
mad. Am I like, I have allergies or something? What's going on here? This feels like a room on

805
02:47:21,430 --> 02:47:25,530
a spaceship or something, but whatever. It's like an escape pod. All right. I got my window. I need

806
02:47:25,530 --> 02:47:43,299
my installations for the bathroom. Okay. Bathroom. I want toilet plumbing system. Toilet is going to

807
02:47:43,299 --> 02:48:10,420
go right. Okay. I also want a shower. Yeah. No bathtub. Shower plumbing system. Shower can be

808
02:48:10,420 --> 02:48:24,020
in the corner over here. Can I not move it up? There we go. All right. That's fine. Let's go.

809
02:48:24,020 --> 02:48:35,139
No bathtub. I don't need a bathtub. Did you actually put lemon juice in your eye?

810
02:48:35,139 --> 02:48:53,799
Where'd I get the lemon juice from? This is kind of lemony. It's kind of lemony. Okay. Shower.

811
02:48:53,799 --> 02:49:29,559
Say it with me now. Oh, none of you are fucking going to do it. That's surprising. Okay. There's

812
02:49:29,559 --> 02:49:36,280
the shower. That looks fine. Let's watch out for the door. What is this? Oh, a toilet needs to go

813
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:56,299
here. Toilet. Okay. Suspended toilet. I was like, what? I was like, is this a toilet? Standing toilet

814
02:49:56,299 --> 02:50:24,299
paper. All right. How about this one? Now I just need a sink. I need some toilet paper there. See?

815
02:50:24,299 --> 02:50:32,680
Okay. Now I need to sink and a mirror and a painting. I need a weight. I need a mountable

816
02:50:32,680 --> 02:50:59,639
sink. Right there. Why am I so itchy? Rotate the shower. You can do that in your game. All right.

817
02:50:59,639 --> 02:51:18,739
I need a mountable sink. Oh, I like that. I like this one. I like that kind of basin style. The

818
02:51:18,739 --> 02:51:23,579
water always comes out of these really cool. Let me see if I can describe. You know what I mean?

819
02:51:23,579 --> 02:51:32,469
When it's like, it's this weird, there's no bubbles in the water. It's just this really see-through

820
02:51:33,270 --> 02:51:37,450
stream. Do you know what I'm talking about? When you turn on a faucet and it goes,

821
02:51:38,170 --> 02:51:50,500
it's called laminar flow. Yeah. What is that called? Cause I want it. Laminar flow. Okay.

822
02:51:50,500 --> 02:52:02,629
I want that. I love that so much. It's like my favorite thing in the world.

823
02:52:02,629 --> 02:52:22,059
There are microplastics in it. I don't have one. There are microplastics all over your body right

824
02:52:22,059 --> 02:52:33,719
now. We'll get them off. I don't want them on me. Put a trash can in here. Yep. This looks fine.

825
02:52:33,719 --> 02:52:57,659
There. Now I just need a painting. I need a bathroom painting. Like a lemon. I just need a lemon.

826
02:52:57,659 --> 02:53:17,030
Something lemony. Something lemony. That's kind of lemony. That one was the most lemony, I think.

827
02:53:17,030 --> 02:53:36,120
This one looks pretty lemony, I think. This one is way too fucking big. Why are these so huge?

828
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:51,930
Okay. Now I need a mirror. Just a basic one. Oh, all right. I like that. Bigger than that,

829
02:53:51,930 --> 02:54:08,979
though. Is that too high? Is that too low? Okay. That's fine. Look at that. The bathroom is done

830
02:54:08,979 --> 02:54:21,979
and it's a beautiful one. I need a little rug. This one's a lemony. Oh, and I don't know anything

831
02:54:21,979 --> 02:54:30,600
about design. I don't know anything about how the world works. Look at that. Take a look. That's a

832
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:35,239
nice bathroom. It's fine. There's nothing wrong with it. Oh, but you need to rotate the shower

833
02:54:35,239 --> 02:54:44,840
and start banning them. Okay. So that's cool. Now we can start to think about where I want

834
02:54:44,840 --> 02:54:54,729
the animals to be. Here's the front door. Okay. Front door. Coming in here. What do I want the

835
02:54:54,729 --> 02:55:00,020
painting on the walls to be? And is there going to be another room? I think so. All right. Yeah.

836
02:55:01,219 --> 02:55:19,350
Watch. Let's get rid of this. That's the bathroom. This is the bedroom. And then I need, this will

837
02:55:19,350 --> 02:55:28,379
be a nice enclosure here. Right here. I can maybe do some fish tanks and shit. I am so ready. This

838
02:55:28,379 --> 02:55:31,899
is going to be so fun. Are you guys ready? It's going to be so fun. It's going to be so cool.

839
02:55:31,899 --> 02:55:57,579
Okay. So the wall should be there. Just we'll go straight across from here to there. What's wrong?

840
02:55:57,579 --> 02:56:06,100
And my axe and my bow. And my axe and my bow. Activate sleeper agent. Code onion ring.

841
02:56:10,540 --> 02:56:31,190
Whatever. Okay. I need the walls again. Onion ring. It's actually kind of fun and funny that

842
02:56:31,190 --> 02:56:41,860
I will, I will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on shows. And the biggest memes that come

843
02:56:41,860 --> 02:56:48,409
out of these, this channel is like, I found an onion ring in my French fries. And I'm the guy

844
02:56:48,409 --> 02:57:11,540
from the Among Us guy. I'm the serial killer AI guy. That's so funny. They're uneven. What do you,

845
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:17,299
I'm fixing it right now, but they have to be uneven because I want it to be flush to the door

846
02:57:17,299 --> 02:57:24,219
here. It doesn't have to be flush to the door. Okay. That's actually annoying. It can be flush

847
02:57:24,219 --> 02:57:47,930
with this. So whatever. So this now can go here because I want this to be the wall. This is going

848
02:57:47,930 --> 02:57:58,889
to be our first enclosure. Here we go. Let's go. Here we go. Let's do it. All right. So what should

849
02:57:58,889 --> 02:58:18,360
I put in here? I'm wondering, what do you guys think? I need lights. First of all, chickens.

850
02:58:19,989 --> 02:58:35,829
What can you actually put in here? I just want a lamp. There's a cat treadmill. I just want lights,

851
02:58:35,829 --> 02:58:41,739
ceiling lamps, just something basic for now. I can play with it later. Just basic, basic,

852
02:58:41,739 --> 02:58:45,450
just to get light in here. It doesn't have to be exact. Everyone's going to be pissed that they're

853
02:58:45,450 --> 02:58:58,729
not lined up correctly. It's just to get light in here. Okay. So this is animal room one. Let's

854
02:58:58,729 --> 02:59:05,739
see what I want to do here. Pets. Wellen freshwater aquarium. Snake terrarium. Should

855
02:59:05,739 --> 02:59:20,790
I do some snakes? What should be up here? Birds? Hamsters? Just do a bunch of reptiles. Spider

856
02:59:20,790 --> 02:59:29,750
terrarium. Spiders will go downstairs. Okay. Let's do a bunch of iguanas and lizards. All right. Let's

857
02:59:29,750 --> 02:59:44,100
do lizards. This thing is huge. This thing is actually too big. No, it's not. All right. Here's

858
02:59:44,100 --> 02:59:58,819
our iguana terrarium. It fits perfectly in this spot. I can put some little decorations around it.

859
02:59:58,819 --> 03:00:07,739
Nice. Okay. Buy two to fill the wall. I don't think two will fit. All right. Now we can do

860
03:00:07,739 --> 03:00:15,879
like a snake and a snake. What are the small reptiles going to do? Do aquarium. What about,

861
03:00:15,879 --> 03:00:27,750
yeah, snakes maybe. Oh yeah. We can do four. All right. Let me put this on a counter. Is it like

862
03:00:27,750 --> 03:00:40,819
a table or a counter or something that I can build it on top of? Do a turtle. Well, let's do snakes

863
03:00:40,819 --> 03:00:49,190
over here and then turtles over there. I don't even do I have access to a snake? Or am I access

864
03:00:49,190 --> 03:01:01,459
to a turtle? Hamster? Where's turtle? Turtle's not here. Oh, there we go. Okay. How big is this?

865
03:01:01,459 --> 03:01:08,549
All right. This is huge. It can just, I think, can it just sit on the ground, right? It can just

866
03:01:08,549 --> 03:01:15,639
sit there, right? That's fine. Should I just do two turtles or should I do two snakes over here?

867
03:01:15,639 --> 03:01:29,639
Turtle, iguana, and two snakes. You look like a fish. Yeah, whatever. I'll do two snakes,

868
03:01:29,639 --> 03:01:37,159
but I need to be up off the ground. What is it? Because my mouth goes like this? Because my mouth

869
03:01:37,159 --> 03:01:42,979
goes like that. My lips. I have like these, I have like a fish mouth. Yeah. You don't think I know

870
03:01:42,979 --> 03:01:49,559
that? You don't think I know I have like a mouth that like goes like too far this way? You don't

871
03:01:49,639 --> 03:01:55,459
think I've ever seen that before? You don't think I've never looked at that before? I can breathe

872
03:01:55,459 --> 03:02:05,299
underwater. You can't. What if I just lifted up my like neck over here and it was just gills? Just

873
03:02:05,299 --> 03:02:22,020
like bing bing bing bing bing. Okay, Jim Carrey, settle down. Okay, I need a counter. This is

874
03:02:22,020 --> 03:02:39,799
probably big enough, right? I don't want it to be like that though. Here we go. I think that's fine.

875
03:02:39,799 --> 03:02:59,659
Yeah, that's like kind of snake themed, isn't it? I need a longer than that. There's a shorter one,

876
03:02:59,659 --> 03:03:29,909
right? Look at that. Perfect. Can I fit two? I can. No, I can't. Yes, I can. There we go.

877
03:03:29,989 --> 03:03:41,139
Okay, we got two snakes. I got a turtle and an iguana. Pretty cool. All right. Now what?

878
03:03:41,139 --> 03:03:48,229
Let's do this while I'm here. This room needs to be a little bit more inviting too. What should be

879
03:03:48,229 --> 03:04:02,790
what should go on the ground? I don't know what to put on the ground. Put a snake skin rug on the

880
03:04:02,790 --> 03:04:21,180
ground. Excuse me? All right, I need to do um the walls are just so awful looking. Oh, let's go back

881
03:04:21,180 --> 03:04:51,860
to pets. What else is here? There's no bunnies in here. Don't do that. What is this? Holy shit.

882
03:04:51,860 --> 03:05:25,639
How do I get out of here? I'm stuck here. That's going right here. Oh my god. That's so annoyingly

883
03:05:25,639 --> 03:05:32,620
large. Where? How? What are you supposed to do with this? What are you actually supposed to do

884
03:05:32,620 --> 03:05:52,409
with this? Why is this floating? Oh, it goes against the corner. Okay, what's what does this

885
03:05:52,409 --> 03:06:01,209
go to? Oh, fuck it. Whatever. I don't care. What does this go to? It's the bathroom shit. Um,

886
03:06:01,209 --> 03:06:30,420
we can go over here. That works. What is that? It is a cat aggro crag. It's the bedroom. I'll do

887
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:39,989
that later. Bathroom is fine. All right, here's the let's go back in here. Take care of this.

888
03:06:39,989 --> 03:06:55,909
I need to do this. Where do you eat? I'll make a little kitchenette over here. Kitchenette can

889
03:06:55,909 --> 03:07:28,760
exist over there. I think it should be fine. I got three hundred thirteen thousand bucks. I'm fine.

890
03:07:28,760 --> 03:07:45,940
Get rid of this too. I don't want this. Here's the back entrance. We're going to do a little

891
03:07:45,940 --> 03:07:50,420
we're going to do a huge patio here and there's going to be a ton of play areas for the dogs,

892
03:07:50,420 --> 03:07:56,649
the cats. Just let me how much does it cost to buy like 40 animals? Is it more than three hundred

893
03:07:56,649 --> 03:08:06,860
thousand dollars? It's probably a lot. Yeah, it's probably a lot. We're going to find out

894
03:08:06,860 --> 03:08:17,850
if I need to go sell the other house. I will. Okay, back to this room is the reptile den.

895
03:08:17,850 --> 03:08:23,879
I'm going to think of the night if the reptile den is going to be green. It's going to be green,

896
03:08:24,520 --> 03:08:36,860
light green, dark green on the floor. Yeah. Oh, that's kind of cool. It could be green,

897
03:08:36,860 --> 03:08:51,430
green and brown. Let's just do some paint. Yeah, something like this. Strong green maybe for the

898
03:08:51,430 --> 03:08:59,579
see for the walls. Now that's too dark. Here we go. How about like spring grass or ripe hair?

899
03:08:59,579 --> 03:09:05,420
We'll try spring grass. I feel like this is going to be it. My god, my eyeball is going to fall out

900
03:09:05,420 --> 03:09:27,129
of my head. Let's do a sample. I mean, it's the reptile room. That's what's happening. This is

901
03:09:27,129 --> 03:09:47,989
the reptile room. You spoke too much. No, I did not. I like that. That's cute. I can put some

902
03:09:47,989 --> 03:09:52,790
paintings up. We will dress it up a little bit so it doesn't look so plain. It's too light. We'll

903
03:09:52,790 --> 03:10:22,329
dress it up. Don't worry. No one's going to see this wall, so who cares? It's good. Paint it.

904
03:10:22,329 --> 03:10:46,760
Landlord special. Don't paint behind the furniture. I don't know. I feel like if I was a landlord,

905
03:10:46,760 --> 03:10:54,520
I feel like I would be constantly just, is everything okay over there? Things going good?

906
03:10:54,520 --> 03:11:01,860
Something break? Does something need fixing? I would want it to be like really good over there.

907
03:11:01,860 --> 03:11:19,540
I don't understand that concept. I would be so concerned that you can't tell if this doesn't

908
03:11:19,540 --> 03:11:37,829
look good. If I was like, hey, my sink is broken and I need someone to come fix it. I'd be like,

909
03:11:37,829 --> 03:11:43,450
you stay right there. I'll be over in five minutes and I get out of my pajamas and go over.

910
03:11:43,450 --> 03:11:51,659
I don't know. That's because I want to make sure this shit's fucking taken care of. I own this

911
03:11:51,659 --> 03:12:01,590
property. If I own this fucking place, what am I just going to hang up? Yeah, I don't care.

912
03:12:01,590 --> 03:12:11,110
What the fuck are you talking about? I'll be over there in five minutes. Okay, so that's the green.

913
03:12:11,110 --> 03:12:25,750
This is a nice green reptile room. They do do that. Could you fix it? I would get the appropriate

914
03:12:25,750 --> 03:12:39,510
person that could or try. You need to be there. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, I kind of like this

915
03:12:39,510 --> 03:12:46,520
wood for the reptile room, don't you? I think it's kind of like the Jurassic Park kind of.

916
03:12:46,520 --> 03:12:59,479
I kind of like it. I don't mind this. Okay, we're going to leave that for now. I'll come back to

917
03:12:59,479 --> 03:13:07,540
this. Okay, so now I need to figure out where I'm going to have my leisure time. And I think

918
03:13:07,540 --> 03:13:15,540
this is going to be an aquarium in here, by the way. That's going to be the aquarium room.

919
03:13:15,540 --> 03:13:42,010
In fact, let's get this started right now. Okay, I need counters. Counter. Okay.

920
03:13:49,020 --> 03:14:05,219
My fucking eye, it's fucked up. All right, I need this. I need a long counter. Are you allergic

921
03:14:05,219 --> 03:14:14,729
to reptiles? No, I'm fine. This is way too short, like a shoe rack. Dude, you blink like a reptile.

922
03:14:14,729 --> 03:14:28,120
I also go like this every 15 seconds. I probably am a reptile. That has to be a little bit higher.

923
03:14:28,120 --> 03:15:00,489
I blink a lot. I go, I look my lips all the time. I don't know. This is going to be so sick coming

924
03:15:00,489 --> 03:15:08,069
in. Oh, this is basic. This has been facing the wrong way the whole time, hasn't it? Has it? It

925
03:15:08,069 --> 03:15:16,469
has been. Oops. I got to go. Shit. I got to fix that. The other ones in there are backwards.

926
03:15:16,469 --> 03:15:34,579
It's okay. Light. They all have lights. Well, that's cool. Okay. Well, these have to flip.

927
03:15:34,579 --> 03:15:58,760
Just leave them. At this point, I really don't care. Those are not flush fish tanks. Okay.

928
03:15:58,760 --> 03:16:11,989
Fresh water. We'll do fresh water over here. Whoa, that's a lot. This is huge. I can't. All right.

929
03:16:11,989 --> 03:16:34,700
I got to rethink this. Oh my god. This is too big. This is way too fucking big. Maybe not. It's not

930
03:16:34,700 --> 03:17:16,680
going to be big if I have a smaller door. Nice. Is this facing the wrong way? I can't really tell.

931
03:17:16,680 --> 03:17:32,409
Oh, this looks like a PetSmart. It kind of does. It does look like a PetSmart. Stack them. Can I do

932
03:17:32,409 --> 03:17:42,680
that? I can't stack them. That's fine. I don't need more than that. That's a nice entryway.

933
03:17:42,680 --> 03:18:00,680
It's the Rainforest Cafe. Where's the iguana? Oh, I didn't finish that. Something reptilian.

934
03:18:00,680 --> 03:18:25,930
This is kind of reptilian. Oh, some of these are pretty reptilian. This feels like a really big

935
03:18:25,930 --> 03:18:50,659
afterthought. This is fine. I like the kind of, yeah, these are like kind of leaves and shit.

936
03:18:50,659 --> 03:19:03,590
I don't know. People do weird shit like that with paintings, don't they? All right, that's fine. I

937
03:19:03,590 --> 03:19:31,139
don't put a little table here. Cat aviary? What's a cat aviary? Where's the dog? I haven't gotten

938
03:19:31,139 --> 03:19:39,750
there yet. I just need like a, yeah, like one of these is fine. No, that's in the way. I don't care.

939
03:19:40,469 --> 03:19:43,270
That's fine. This is as good as it's going to get because I need to get the animals in here.

940
03:19:43,989 --> 03:19:55,530
All right. This is the front door. You got your cat tree thing here that can stay open. I need a

941
03:19:55,530 --> 03:20:04,600
little kitchen. Kitchen's going to have to be right here. Just a little kitchenette because this goes

942
03:20:04,600 --> 03:20:15,979
into the bathroom. This is the bedroom. We're going to move this to here because I need this

943
03:20:15,979 --> 03:20:24,969
to be a kitchen. So that's what's going to happen. I need this to be, this has to be a little kitchen

944
03:20:24,969 --> 03:20:46,090
area. Otherwise, how am I going to cook? That's better. Okay, so now this can be a little kitchen

945
03:20:46,090 --> 03:21:18,309
corner. I'm thinking, I want tile. See how this looks. No passion. That looks stupid. If this was

946
03:21:18,309 --> 03:21:44,420
a kitchen area, I didn't see the whole thing. It looks like a pizza parlor. Why do I know what

947
03:21:44,420 --> 03:21:53,959
you mean? But it's, I don't secret room, secret room. Why do you keep saying secret room? What

948
03:21:53,959 --> 03:22:36,440
do you mean secret room? There's a room on your map. Huh? What is this? What the fuck is this?

949
03:22:36,440 --> 03:22:54,139
What is this? Um, oh, well, okay, I can take this down. So now this can be the little kitchenette

950
03:22:54,139 --> 03:23:05,799
in here. That's okay. That's much better because then I can do a little kitchen in here.

951
03:23:05,799 --> 03:23:15,340
Okay, I get it. Nice. That makes sense. Okay, so now let's do, uh, what do I, I don't like the way

952
03:23:15,340 --> 03:23:30,569
that looked. Something nice and kitchen-y. This is kind of kitchen-y. That's kind of kitchen-y,

953
03:23:30,569 --> 03:23:53,260
isn't it? It looks like a chocolate bar. It just looks like a new Hershey's chocolate s'more thing.

954
03:23:54,360 --> 03:24:12,250
Maybe it works. I need to see the whole thing. Nah, I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like

955
03:24:12,250 --> 03:24:34,709
it. I'm not a huge fan, so I'm taking it down. What about this one? It's grandma wallpaper. Let's

956
03:24:34,709 --> 03:24:42,459
try this one. A little bit lighter though. Yeah, like a light biscuit. Let's try that. Light biscuits

957
03:24:42,459 --> 03:25:11,000
should be good. That's better. That's fine. Yeah, that's, that looks cute. What's wrong with that?

958
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:27,909
This should, I have it go all the way out though. Yeah, probably like that. I'll change this. Okay,

959
03:25:27,909 --> 03:25:44,139
that floor has got to go. Please add trim. I just want to get rid of these. So, I need a better

960
03:25:44,139 --> 03:26:00,280
floor for here. What should I put in here? Tile? A nicer tile. A nice tile. I like tile. What's

961
03:26:00,280 --> 03:26:26,649
wrong with tile? One of these looks good. I like that. Let's try this. What's wrong with that? I

962
03:26:26,649 --> 03:26:39,739
need a stopping point for this though, and I don't like it being here. Oh, it's the same thing that's

963
03:26:39,739 --> 03:26:53,850
in the bathroom. Is that fine? I think that's okay. Isn't this, I think that's fine. It's a

964
03:26:53,850 --> 03:27:02,889
fucking ballroom. It's going too far into the living room. Well, I got to figure out what I want

965
03:27:02,889 --> 03:27:22,170
in the living room. What the fuck happened? Why did this fall? Why did that fall? I was worried.

966
03:27:22,170 --> 03:27:31,290
Okay, so I know the kitchen is going to be here, so we're going to do kitchen stuff. I need a fridge.

967
03:27:31,290 --> 03:27:59,159
Uh, I like this. Fridge, and then a counter, an oven. Okay, let's do a fucking double oven.

968
03:27:59,159 --> 03:28:18,010
Triple oven. Okay, triple oven. And then I'll do some cabinets with a washing machine. Dishwasher.

969
03:28:18,010 --> 03:28:39,459
Just good old stainless, stainless steel. That right here. Part of that. We'll get some cabinets

970
03:28:39,459 --> 03:29:10,260
here too. I need a sink. Why, I don't know, why are they so small? That's weird. Fucking horrible.

971
03:29:10,260 --> 03:29:21,100
What kind of, I want just a kitchen sink. I just want a kitchen sink. Okay, here we go. Thank you.

972
03:29:21,100 --> 03:29:35,159
Give me this one. Does this even match? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, we'll do a counter this way.

973
03:29:35,159 --> 03:30:27,430
One counter, one counter. Whoa! Give me this thing. Oh my god, it's already done. I don't have to do

974
03:30:27,430 --> 03:31:01,049
anything. It's already ready. That's so much better. Okay, cool. That sink is trash. It's fine. Okay,

975
03:31:01,049 --> 03:31:27,659
looks fine. Let's make one of these over on the other side. I'll be honest, I don't care. I don't

976
03:31:27,659 --> 03:31:47,899
give a shit. I tell you, I don't care. Zero passion. I'm passionate about the animals, not about what

977
03:31:47,899 --> 03:31:56,819
the kitchen looks like. That doesn't even look that bad. All right, so now I can, let's clean this up.

978
03:31:56,819 --> 03:32:05,379
Cat, tower, aquarium, and then the bugs and the bugs will be down here. Okay, cool. Let's get that

979
03:32:05,379 --> 03:32:19,700
started. All right, I need some dog stuff and cat stuff. Here's the little kitchen, living room.

980
03:32:19,700 --> 03:32:36,389
Oops. I'll put stairs somewhere else. Stairs will be, where the hell the stairs gonna go?

981
03:32:36,389 --> 03:32:42,200
I think they need to be down like over here. Over here in this corner? Where am I gonna put the

982
03:32:42,200 --> 03:33:00,170
stairs? Maybe they can, I thought maybe they can only be in that spot. This works. This actually

983
03:33:00,170 --> 03:33:59,459
kind of works. Come on, really? Give me a break. Okay, this is scary. I need it there temporarily.

984
03:33:59,459 --> 03:34:12,010
I can't even go down this. There's so many more. Okay, but it takes up so much less space.

985
03:34:12,010 --> 03:34:28,520
This takes up so much less room. The other one is this big. It's so massive. Evil cellar. Not,

986
03:34:28,600 --> 03:34:41,620
just wait. It's less cute. What do the other stairs look like? Garden stairs. Okay, wait,

987
03:34:41,620 --> 03:34:55,100
stairs. All right, this is way better. Yeah, yep, yep, yep. We'll make it a little darker.

988
03:34:55,100 --> 03:35:01,909
Okay, that's better. Oh my god, it's so, it's too huge. Look at how huge this fucking thing is.

989
03:35:01,909 --> 03:35:09,959
It's the whole house. I'm keeping the attic stairs. Look at this. This is not gonna work.

990
03:35:09,959 --> 03:35:47,020
Put it on the side. It's too big. The spiral takes up less space. I want a little one. Yeah,

991
03:35:47,020 --> 03:36:17,899
less space. Really? This is the whole house. This is the entire house. All right, this is kind of

992
03:36:17,899 --> 03:36:22,629
stupid, but whatever. Do I really need the cat thing? Are you trying to tell me to get rid of

993
03:36:22,629 --> 03:36:30,200
the cat thing? I can't put it anywhere else. Maybe over here? There's no other corner where this can

994
03:36:30,200 --> 03:36:40,790
go. No, this has to stay. I can't move that. I think that's fine, although the color is awful.

995
03:36:40,790 --> 03:36:53,959
This just needs to be a little more unassuming. Okay, that's a little better. I think that's fine.

996
03:36:53,959 --> 03:37:01,770
It doesn't matter. Look, it's not gonna be a TV. I'm putting the couch right here to watch the cats.

997
03:37:01,770 --> 03:37:16,500
That's more interesting than television anyways. It looks like shit, but there's no other place I

998
03:37:16,500 --> 03:37:28,739
can put this unless I get rid of this corner, but then I'd have to make the bathroom entrance here.

999
03:37:28,739 --> 03:37:47,319
Let's try it. Bathroom right in front of the fridge. This shit is way too fucking big.

1000
03:37:47,319 --> 03:37:59,100
It's so enormous. It can't go anywhere. Build another room. I can't. You cannot build out.

1001
03:37:59,100 --> 03:38:04,840
You cannot build out. You can only build in. I can't build. Where am I supposed to put it?

1002
03:38:04,840 --> 03:38:14,170
The only thing I can think of is... Let's see if this does it. Ready? Let's try this. I have an idea.

1003
03:38:14,170 --> 03:39:11,049
I have an idea. Let's see if it works. This would be fine. Not big enough. I could do one here,

1004
03:39:11,049 --> 03:39:19,750
which that's fine. That's fine. That's okay. We don't need two snakes. I'll find a place for it,

1005
03:39:19,750 --> 03:39:26,069
but let me see if I can put the staircase here. Give me a small staircase. Is there a small one

1006
03:39:26,069 --> 03:39:32,229
I can put right here? Right there. Come on. Really? There's no place to go down the stairs?

1007
03:39:32,229 --> 03:39:58,629
I gotta go down there and I gotta break a bunch of shit. Hold on. Fucking dump down here. Yeah,

1008
03:39:58,629 --> 03:40:30,540
I want this here. Okay. I think that should do it. There's just stuff in the way. Is it construction

1009
03:40:30,540 --> 03:40:50,379
lights or something I can put down here? There's a bright ass construction light. I just want to

1010
03:40:50,379 --> 03:41:24,809
be able to see. Okay. Now I should theoretically be able to move this into this corner. At least

1011
03:41:24,809 --> 03:41:44,409
I hope so. Let's find out. Why is there a handprint down here? I don't know. I just bought this place.

1012
03:41:44,409 --> 03:41:54,659
Okay. Now can I move? Hopefully the lights aren't going to be in the way they might though.

1013
03:41:54,659 --> 03:42:12,299
Okay. It looks good. Can I move those over here? Here. Even if it has to be the attic, I don't care.

1014
03:42:12,299 --> 03:42:40,329
It just needs to fit there. I just need a way to get down the stairs. And really? Is this, is it a

1015
03:42:40,329 --> 03:42:47,020
wall there or something? I don't get it. It's a wall here. It's a wall, wall, wall, wall, wall.

1016
03:42:47,020 --> 03:42:59,930
Where's that fucking wall? Where? Oh, bullshit. Why is the house wider? That should be able to

1017
03:42:59,930 --> 03:43:31,000
go right there. Turn it around. I don't think that's going to work. I'll try it. No, no. Switch sides.

1018
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:51,379
Oh shit. Is it going to fit? Yes. Okay. Can the regular staircase fit here though? No, not really.

1019
03:43:53,500 --> 03:44:52,780
Kind of. No, but it's messing up my view. I guess I could do this with something else over here

1020
03:44:52,780 --> 03:45:24,040
because now I can move this down. I'll do this wall. Will that fit over here? All the snakes can fit

1021
03:45:24,040 --> 03:45:37,590
now. Nice. Okay. Yes. All right. We're good. I want to be a little bit more unassuming though. I don't

1022
03:45:37,590 --> 03:45:55,639
like the light. That looks good. That's fine. Okay. The light switches above the stairs. I'll fix it

1023
03:45:55,639 --> 03:46:04,889
later. Okay. So now that does that. Reptile room is still fine. I can fix the green paint. I can

1024
03:46:04,889 --> 03:46:09,719
weigh down. Where does this end up? Actually, perfect. I'm actually really happy with that.

1025
03:46:09,719 --> 03:46:19,860
We're gonna keep it. Okay. Let's get some animals in here. Where do I get animals? Where do I get

1026
03:46:19,860 --> 03:46:38,280
animals? Where's my dog? Oh, I have to go to the menu. Okay. Okay. Let's get... Where's my dog?

1027
03:46:38,280 --> 03:46:59,079
Where's my dog? Come here. All right. There's dog. So now let's get some reptiles. Iguana. Whoa.

1028
03:46:59,079 --> 03:47:20,229
Turtle. We need a turtle. Okay. We need it. One turtle. Name. Crunch. Oh, there you are. Okay.

1029
03:47:20,229 --> 03:47:54,010
Where's crunch? There's crunch. Okay. Crunch looks good. You're gonna go eat? Very cool. All

1030
03:47:54,010 --> 03:48:07,829
right. I'm happy. Now I need... Here. How's the treat? Delicious. Okay. Now I need an iguana. How

1031
03:48:07,829 --> 03:48:32,459
many iguanas can I put in here? Just one, right? Iguana's name. I want... How many iguanas should I

1032
03:48:32,459 --> 03:48:58,790
get? Oh, it needs its own enclosure. Let's go look at Fred. Whoa. Hey, Fred. What do you eat?

1033
03:48:58,790 --> 03:49:22,520
Deviled eggs and lettuce? Okay. Very cool. Fred doesn't come out. What a dinosaur. I don't think

1034
03:49:22,520 --> 03:49:43,319
they come out. That's so cool. Okay. Well, have fun in there, Fred. What are you up to? Let's leave

1035
03:49:43,319 --> 03:49:50,219
it open. I'm not gonna leave the enclosure open. You guys want all the... You know, I'm sorry. No,

1036
03:49:50,219 --> 03:49:57,879

1048
03:53:03,290 --> 03:53:07,290
Okay. I thought that was just cats eating the dog food. Make sure the dog doesn't eat the cat food.

Okay. Cats. Automatic cat food feeder. We'll put one here. We should probably do two and then we'll

Where is it downstairs? Okay. This is going to be bugs, but okay. This would be the bug room.

1066
03:57:18,860 --> 03:57:36,059
I need more room. This would be the designated insect room. What was that? We need rodents too.

1067
03:57:36,059 --> 03:57:40,200
All right. One step at a time. This would be the rodent room. These would be the bug room. This

1068
03:57:40,200 --> 03:57:44,680
would be the rodent room. This will be more downstairs play area for the cats, dogs and

1069
03:57:44,680 --> 03:58:00,299
wherever. So let me get this. Let me do this first. How much should I feed? The downstairs is for

Okay. There are just birds. Flight. Nevermind. Ooh, look at this one. How about one of these

1079
04:00:44,969 --> 04:00:54,379
little box now. Is it, is it pee on the ground? Oh, there's like a little, yeah, there's poop

04:00:54,379 --> 04:01:05,559
right here. All right. I got, I have a little box now, so I'm fine. I don't have to pick it up.

Get rid of that. Okay. I need a new floor. The floor is shit colored. The floor. It's, I can't

1082
04:01:22,219 --> 04:01:35,180

1083
04:01:35,180 --> 04:01:40,149
Nobody's going outside. Everyone's staying right here. And how come no one's used the fun cat

1084
04:01:40,149 --> 04:01:55,450
thing? There's a shit in the sink. There is not a shit in the sink. Uh, okay. Wait, maybe I should

1085
04:01:55,450 --> 04:02:01,610
let them go out. Yeah. You need to go out, right? It's a big yard. You guys want to go hang out?

1086
04:02:01,610 --> 04:02:17,479
Look, there's, just be careful. The eagle. Is there a fence? I don't think their programming

1087
04:02:17,479 --> 04:02:23,139
will make them, I don't, this is a invisible wall, I think. Yeah. It's an, it's not an invisible wall.

1088
04:02:23,139 --> 04:02:38,819
I don't think they can even come down here. I really, I really doubt it. This is my cat.

1089
04:02:38,819 --> 04:02:51,100
Oh, come here. Go get the yarn. They're having so much fun. Okay. Everyone's having such a good

1090
04:02:51,100 --> 04:03:16,950

1091
04:03:16,950 --> 04:03:38,069
they can't go over here. There. Okay. That's good. This looks like shit. It just needs to be

1092
04:03:38,069 --> 04:03:42,739
practical. It doesn't look all right. Very cool. All right. Uh, this one has, there's a fence around

1093
04:03:42,739 --> 04:03:54,010
here. They're good. I messed it up. Just wait. Look, it's fine. They can't get out this way.

1094
04:03:54,010 --> 04:04:19,899
They can't get out over here. They can get out over here though. Let me fix this. Watch out. Watch

1095
04:04:20,379 --> 04:04:26,340

04:07:35,079 --> 04:07:47,610
How's the iguana doing? All right. Build food. Get some eye drops. I'm currently streaming right

1109
04:07:47,610 --> 04:08:08,950

1110
04:08:08,950 --> 04:08:21,420
The snake got out. There's no snake. I didn't buy one. I didn't buy a snake. I didn't buy a snake.

1111
04:08:21,420 --> 04:09:00,549
Come get it. Come get it. Oh, they're all trying to get it. Who's gonna get it? Here. Have one of

1113
04:09:16,889 --> 04:09:28,549
What's happening? How come nobody's using their litter boxes? There's a shit directly

1114
04:09:28,549 --> 04:09:47,190
next to the litter box. All right. We're fine. Let's get the downstairs rolling because that's

1115
04:09:47,190 --> 04:09:54,680
where a lot of beds are going to go for the dogs. Oh, cool. Look at this. Oh my goodness.

1118
04:10:41,829 --> 04:10:58,840
We need some more recreation down here. All right. We need recreation. Everybody watch out.

1119
04:10:58,840 --> 04:11:06,360
Careful. Not everybody come in here at the same time. All right. Let's just dog beds. I need some

1120
04:11:06,360 --> 04:11:12,459
beds. Let's make it a little more comfortable down here too. Carpets. I know people are going to go,

1121
04:11:12,459 --> 04:11:16,579
what are you talking about? I want to be nice and comfortable. I'll get steam cleaned once a fucking

1122
04:11:16,579 --> 04:11:40,329
week. There's going to be beds down here. There'd be toys. It's going to be awesome. This is where

1123
04:11:40,969 --> 04:12:00,229
there's going to be tons of space. Okay. Looks good so far. So this is going to be another

1124
04:12:00,870 --> 04:12:07,750
different animal room. Get it up to the wall here. There's so much room down here as well. All right.

1125
04:12:07,750 --> 04:12:15,110
So now we're going to do, please have the rats in the basement. Yeah. The rats are going to be in

1126
04:12:15,110 --> 04:12:22,790
here, but if I'm going to have like five dogs, I need a ton of space. So let's go ahead and get

1127
04:12:22,790 --> 04:12:38,600
some dog stuff. Okay. Sleeping mat. Here we go. Yeah. Everybody's going to have a little spot.

1128
04:12:38,600 --> 04:12:47,850
There we go. Right there. Everybody's going to get a little space. We'll go with a little smaller

1129
04:12:47,850 --> 04:12:56,340
one. Some dogs like the little beds. They don't want the huge ones. That was stereo. Yeah. Like

1130
04:12:56,340 --> 04:13:05,500
a little one. Yeah. Like this. Some dogs like just like the mat, right? Perfect. Okay. Sleeping

1131
04:13:05,500 --> 04:13:20,020

1132
04:13:20,020 --> 04:13:46,790
Follow me. Can you not go down the stairs? They can't go downstairs. What? So when it's time for

1133
04:13:46,790 --> 04:13:53,799
bed, I have to pick each one of them up individually and bring them down to bed? Swap the reptiles for

1134
04:13:53,799 --> 04:14:13,139
the dog beds. Okay. Maybe I should do that. Should I swap the dog beds? I didn't leave them down

1135
04:14:13,139 --> 04:14:29,620
there. I'm going to go get them. Yeah. I'm going to have to swap. Why are you a different color?

1136
04:14:29,620 --> 04:15:05,159
The iguana is a different color. All right. I'm going, I'm swapping. You dope. This is just

1137
04:15:05,159 --> 04:15:29,139
temporary until I get everything down here. Do not, don't go in there. What are you eating? Don't eat.

1138
04:15:29,379 --> 04:15:39,719
What are you eating? All right. Come with me. He's going to jump in. Doofus ate the iguana.

1139
04:15:40,680 --> 04:15:51,239
No, the iguana is up in there. Fine. Let's move the beds. I'm going to make this more comfortable

1140
04:15:51,239 --> 04:15:59,879
because it shouldn't be a wooden floor. Let's go with some carpet. Let me get nice and comfy.

1141
04:16:07,370 --> 04:16:22,459
I can stay with that gray. That's fine. I'm going to repaint this whole room. All right. Yeah. I'm

1142
04:16:22,459 --> 04:16:28,139
going to make this a little comfier. What do you mean? This is not carpet. Gray fitted carpet.

1143
04:16:28,139 --> 04:16:34,979
That's carpet. What are you talking about? This is ugly. Yeah. Well, it's, this doesn't, it's not

1144
04:16:34,979 --> 04:16:53,239
going to be this insanely. What is that? I can stay. Okay. Dog beds coming up. Perfect spot.

1145
04:16:53,239 --> 04:17:13,879
And the cat beds can come in here too, probably. Right there. All right. Bring a couple of cat

1146
04:17:13,879 --> 04:17:40,229
beds in here. Oh, okay. I'll come back. Change the color of the room. I will. I don't need this.

1147
04:17:40,229 --> 04:17:46,889
Okay. How are we doing? Plenty of food, plenty of water. Does anyone want to play with this?

1148
04:17:46,889 --> 04:17:56,920
Why won't anybody go up here? The house keeps getting worse. I'm in the middle of

1149
04:17:56,920 --> 04:18:07,719
handling it. I just didn't understand. Hidden room off the kitchen. Where is this hidden room?

1150
04:18:07,719 --> 04:18:14,219
There's no way. This is my fucking bedroom, dude. Do I even need a bedroom? What was the,

1151
04:18:14,219 --> 04:18:28,540
what's the point of the bedroom? Okay. And put some toys in here. That can stay there.

1152
04:18:28,540 --> 04:18:38,389
I should just sleep on the floor. Who cares? Where did you get this? You don't have any needs.

1153
04:18:38,389 --> 04:18:43,879
Somebody has needs over here. Who is it? Needs sleep. Oh, we'll go to bed. Go in the,

1154
04:18:43,879 --> 04:19:02,780
go lie down over here. Look, come here. In here. Get some sleep. Right there. That's just like Otto.

1155
04:19:02,780 --> 04:19:16,680
Otto does that too. Little Otto. Okay. Let's put a few toys in there. Is this rabbit shit or is

1156
04:19:16,680 --> 04:19:25,079
this cat shit? I don't know. This floor has to be a different color than shit brown. It's kind of,

1157
04:19:25,079 --> 04:20:21,989
it's changing right now. These? Okay. At least I can see the shit on the ground. The door doesn't

1158
04:20:21,989 --> 04:20:29,700
go anywhere. I know. I haven't fixed it yet. I'm in the process of getting this done. My game is

1159
04:20:29,700 --> 04:20:37,829
lagging. There's too many animals in this house. We have some comfortable living space now. Tons

1160
04:20:37,829 --> 04:20:50,549
of room over here. Did you just? Go in the dog bed. So now let's see. What else do I want?

1161
04:20:50,549 --> 04:21:00,100
You need more animals. I mean, I want, I need space to accommodate them. Okay. Rodents. Hamster.

1162
04:21:00,100 --> 04:21:13,450
There's no rats. I think the game is having trouble loading any more animals. The game does

1163
04:21:13,450 --> 04:21:23,450
not want to load any more animals. It doesn't like that I have 10 already. Fill the house with

1164
04:21:23,450 --> 04:21:34,120
spiders. All right. Let me move this out of the way. Can I not put any more? That's kind of annoying.

1165
04:21:34,120 --> 04:22:01,500
What's wrong with this? Excuse me. How is that not enough room? I don't, I don't get it. There's

1166
04:22:01,500 --> 04:22:33,129
plenty of room. Ceiling is too low. Light. Can I not put any more animals in? Dude, what is the

1167
04:22:33,129 --> 04:22:54,020
problem with nothing on the wall? Whatever. Can I go back to the, I want to get some, um, spiders

1168
04:22:54,020 --> 04:23:27,530
and rats and stuff. Oh, there we go. Okay. So let's see. Spiders. Spidey. So somebody said,

1169
04:23:27,530 --> 04:23:35,989
I love how you're putting the gross animals down here. Where? Ah, he's right there. I see him. Oh,

1170
04:23:35,989 --> 04:24:01,000
what the fuck? Oh, I don't like that. Don't let it out. Don't let it out. Why is it on the floor?

1171
04:24:01,000 --> 04:24:05,639
Cause I need to, I'm just temporarily, I just want to see if it did. All right. I have a snake

1172
04:24:06,200 --> 04:24:31,379
room. Okay. This one's fine. I have one already. Slimy. Morbius. Fine. It's the only time you're

1173
04:24:31,379 --> 04:24:42,950
going to get that. All right. Where's the, where is he? There's a snake. Oh, there you are. You eat

1174
04:24:42,950 --> 04:24:59,350
eggs. That's cool. All right. It's the turtle. I can probably put a few turtles down here if I

1175
04:24:59,350 --> 04:25:22,299
wanted to. Okay. There's the iguana. Spiders. I need the computer down here. You can go out there.

1176
04:25:22,299 --> 04:25:34,809
It's fine. You can go outside. Go for it. Stop shitting next to the food. It's not happy. Here.

1177
04:25:34,809 --> 04:25:55,370
Look, go get it. Come here. How do I, how about play with yarn? You want to play with yarn? Oh,

1178
04:25:55,370 --> 04:26:04,860
there you go. You're happy now. Okay. People are happy. Yeah, they have litter box. Somebody,

1179
04:26:04,860 --> 04:26:09,860
what's wrong with you? What's going on? You need, you're not happy and you just sleep. Well,

1180
04:26:09,860 --> 04:26:21,209
go lie down. Nice catch. Go lie down over here. There's a nice bed just waiting for you and you

1181
04:26:21,690 --> 04:26:35,000
go lie in it. Go to sleep. So cute. I know, I know that's your favorite bone, but you need to go lie

1182
04:26:35,000 --> 04:26:47,500
down. It doesn't want to go to sleep. All right. Who else is here? Who else needs something? No

1183
04:26:47,500 --> 04:26:57,239
needs. No needs. So then we'll, oh, they were hungry. Okay. You still need to go to sleep.

1184
04:26:57,239 --> 04:27:07,049
Go to bed. Everyone else is fine except for you. No, you're fine too. So what's wrong with you?

1185
04:27:07,049 --> 04:27:15,850
What's going on here? No needs. Okay. So you need to go to sleep. All right. Let's go. Um,

1186
04:27:15,850 --> 04:27:33,299
it's kind of dirty over here, isn't it? It's dirty as hell over here. I think it's outside the house.

1187
04:27:33,299 --> 04:27:48,010
The beds are backwards. I don't know how that's possible by the way. I don't know what you mean.

1188
04:27:48,010 --> 04:28:22,329
Like you were right. What? There is no backwards. It's a rectangle actually backwards. That's

1189
04:28:22,329 --> 04:28:27,190
ridiculous. Okay. Well, whatever. I'm going to move this temporarily out here. So there's an extra

1190
04:28:27,190 --> 04:28:43,350
bed back down here. You look good. I need to organize this area. So I want, let's put like,

1191
04:28:43,350 --> 04:29:00,680
I should go down there. I'm taking the computer downstairs. Be good. Okay. How much money do I

1192
04:29:00,680 --> 04:29:30,940
have? Birds. Should I have birds down here? No. How many more spiders should I have? 50? I don't

1193
04:29:30,940 --> 04:29:43,959
think I can have 50. There are no more spiders left to buy. Okay. What about rodents? Hamster? Yep.

1194
04:29:43,959 --> 04:30:09,979
Definitely going to have a hamster. Oh my God. That's big. Um, we'll put some hamsters in here.

1195
04:30:09,979 --> 04:30:17,500
Oh, all right. You need a light. I'm definitely going to not have the snake be in this room.

1196
04:30:17,500 --> 04:30:38,469
No, that's not happening. Are you in here? Okay. You're in here and you have an egg, right? Yep.

1197
04:30:38,469 --> 04:30:45,159
You're good. It's dark down here. I'm going to put some lights in here. There's the turtle. There's

1198
04:30:45,159 --> 04:30:49,370
the hamster. It's too dark in here. Let's get some light. Get a guinea pig. Yeah, I'll get a

1199
04:30:49,370 --> 04:31:00,100
guinea pig. Just something basic. Yeah, this is fine. Just basic shit. Just like Minecraft

1200
04:31:00,100 --> 04:31:38,780
fucking torches. It doesn't matter. There we go. Can I play with the hamster? I think I can just

1201
04:31:38,780 --> 04:31:52,790
watch. So cute. Okay. There are the three spiders. There is my snake, the iguana. All right. What

1202
04:31:52,790 --> 04:32:13,020
else can I buy? Okay. Let's guinea pig. Uh, this one looks good. Um, frumpy. Oh my God. This is way

1203
04:32:13,020 --> 04:32:34,090
too big. This is a children's playground. This is not an enclosure for a guinea pig. Cool. Well,

1204
04:32:34,090 --> 04:33:06,840
have fun in here. Oh, fucking alien. They need, they need way more space than people think.

1205
04:33:06,840 --> 04:33:25,639
Did they really? This is a huge enclosure. I hope, I hope they're very happy. Okay. What else? I don't

1206
04:33:25,639 --> 04:33:46,470
need any more turtles. Another hamster? No. How about another, how about a husky? Um, husko. No

1207
04:33:46,470 --> 04:34:07,189
rats? Yeah, there's no rats. How about some birds? I think I've, should I put birds? Okay. I'm going

1208
04:34:07,189 --> 04:34:15,189
to get some birds in here. Guys, I haven't slept in five days. I need to, I need to fix the bedroom.

1209
04:34:15,189 --> 04:34:42,259
Where can this even go? Holy shit. Guys, I, this can't go anywhere. Wait, do they actually want

1210
04:34:42,259 --> 04:35:16,459
to be outside though? Okay. Let's get some birds. What are you doing down here? Okay. Here's a parrot.

1211
04:35:16,459 --> 04:35:30,709
Tweety. Thanks to your good care, your pet David is growing up. Please remember that all pets,

1212
04:35:30,709 --> 04:35:51,860
regardless of age, need much attention. Who? Who's David? Oh, it's David. Hey, you look,

1213
04:35:52,259 --> 04:36:04,900
you're an adult cat. Oh, that was so fun. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All

1214
04:36:04,900 --> 04:36:12,659
right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I need to, I need to, I need to buy a few more

1215
04:36:12,659 --> 04:36:40,380
birds and then I got to take care of everybody. Um, they're all just parrots, flappy and slippy.

1216
04:36:40,380 --> 04:36:58,020
All right. I need you to come with me. What are you looking at? Okay. You're good. Come with me.

1217
04:36:58,020 --> 04:37:03,639
I thought that was a huge shit log. I was about to say, oh my God, are you okay? You've been in here

1218
04:37:03,639 --> 04:37:38,680
for a long time. You all right? What's going on? Why can't I, um, what's happening? What's

1219
04:37:42,250 --> 04:37:48,310
going on? Why do you just, do you don't want to treat? Oh no. What's happening? How do I fix this?

1220
04:37:48,310 --> 04:38:21,750
Come with me. Come with me. I can't pick the cat up. What do I do? Well, how do I fix this?

1221
04:38:21,750 --> 04:38:44,439
Too many pets of room is still walled off. Um, okay. They're fine. Did they actually, would they

1222
04:38:44,439 --> 04:38:59,659
want to come out? No, right? No, no, no. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's take care

1223
04:38:59,659 --> 04:39:09,500
of everybody. Everyone seems to be okay. What can I do for you? Uh, watch out. Okay. Come here.

1224
04:39:09,500 --> 04:39:23,259
There you go. Okay. You look like you're having a good time. Here, have some yarn. How are you

1225
04:39:23,259 --> 04:39:44,009
doing? You need to go to sleep. Get some sleep. There's tons of bed over here. Go check the beds

1226
04:39:44,009 --> 04:39:49,240
out over here. There's like three that are over here. Everybody's happy. They just, one of them

1227
04:39:49,240 --> 04:40:15,049
is a little tired. How are you doing? Everybody's relatively happy. Have some food. So now we'll go

1228
04:40:15,049 --> 04:40:23,299
get some sleep. Where are you going? What do you need? Come here. All right. Now we're going to

1229
04:40:23,299 --> 04:40:28,169
give four or five of them to the animal person, right? Cause he's like, you take care of them

1230
04:40:28,169 --> 04:40:38,470
for a while and then I can come get them, right? What's going on over here? They need to go to,

1231
04:40:38,470 --> 04:40:47,259
okay. Some of you need to go to sleep. How are you doing? You're doing good. You're holding so much

1232
04:40:47,259 --> 04:41:02,569
shit in your pocket. You got plenty of food. You do too. How are you guys doing? Oh, there you go.

1233
04:41:02,569 --> 04:41:10,729
Delicious water. Do I, I don't have to fill food on this one. How are you doing? You still have

1234
04:41:10,729 --> 04:41:26,630
food, right? Was the whole ground just food? No. Hay is food. Get another guinea pig. No,

1235
04:41:26,630 --> 04:41:34,459
I'm not, there's no, I'm not getting any more animals. I am at capacity. How are you doing?

1236
04:41:34,459 --> 04:41:43,220
Good. Snake is taking a little rest. No, I'm not getting any more. There's no, this is it.

1237
04:41:43,220 --> 04:41:51,930
You've got your salad there. Okay. How are you doing over here? I can't put food in here. I think

1238
04:41:51,930 --> 04:42:05,529
it's just automatic. How are you doing? Yeah. Everyone that has needs needs to sleep, but they

1239
04:42:05,529 --> 04:42:16,299
won't go in the bed. Okay. So now where's my laptop? The guinea pig needs a friend. No,

1240
04:42:16,299 --> 04:42:21,319
I'm not getting any more. No more animals. No, no more. This is it. This is what I can reliably

1241
04:42:21,319 --> 04:42:41,830
take care of. So now, so now what some of them can go. Cause I took them from his hotel, right?

1242
04:42:41,830 --> 04:42:52,470
I was like housing them for a little while. The doorways are too small. Adopt a child. Okay.

1243
04:42:52,470 --> 04:43:04,819
Where are my animals? Oh, here we go. Okay. So then somebody comes in and adopts them.

1244
04:43:04,819 --> 04:43:13,930
Who, where's David? Oh, this is kind of cool. All right. So David, you want to find a new

1245
04:43:13,930 --> 04:43:30,729
home for David? Yeah. Let's get David a nice home. Did I do it? I think Fred needs a nice home too.

1246
04:43:30,729 --> 04:43:40,700
Okay. Scrumptious is going to stick around. Who else needs like, I've been, I've been taking care

1247
04:43:40,700 --> 04:43:49,220
of them and I want them to have good homes. Perfect. I think perfect could get a new, a good home.

1248
04:43:49,220 --> 04:43:58,009
Bugs. Oh, I was like, what, why are they bugs? We'll get bugs should probably have a new home.

1249
04:43:58,009 --> 04:44:08,119
Yeah. I'm like an adoption place, right? I'm like helping the guy with like his adoption stuff.

1250
04:44:08,119 --> 04:44:17,349
Okay. Octavius, you've been a very, very good, good dog. Let's get you a new home. Who should

1251
04:44:17,349 --> 04:44:26,700
I stick around with? Fishy can stay. I think, I think doofus. Don't sell them. I'm not selling

1252
04:44:26,700 --> 04:44:36,389
them. What are you talking about? You're deleting them. I'm not, I'm not deleting them. They're

1253
04:44:36,389 --> 04:44:50,619
finding new homes. What are you talking about? Yeah. I want to make sure they have good homes.

1254
04:44:50,619 --> 04:44:56,599
I don't want to have too many that I can't take care of. I want them to have good homes.

1255
04:44:56,599 --> 04:45:05,669
Okay. Let's pick this up. They have plenty of food, right? All right. Let's take,

1256
04:45:05,669 --> 04:45:18,900
let's do some playtime. So I think somebody grew up. Yeah. All, all the needs are just sleep,

1257
04:45:18,900 --> 04:45:36,040
sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep. Come over here and play with the mouse. Go get it. Adopt. Yeah. I'm,

1258
04:45:36,040 --> 04:45:40,040
I thought I was like a foster house and then they would come and I would put them up for adoption.

1259
04:45:40,040 --> 04:45:46,549
That's what I'm doing. How are you doing? Sleep. Let me guess. They, okay. They, they don't sleep

1260
04:45:46,549 --> 04:46:00,009
and then they get unhappy because they're tired. Do I need more beds? I need more litter boxes.

1261
04:46:00,009 --> 04:46:04,200
Okay. I'm going to add two more litter boxes over here. The dogs don't, the dogs just go out,

1262
04:46:04,200 --> 04:46:17,540
right? You're happy. Everybody seems pretty happy over here. Hungry. Okay. You're really bored. I

1263
04:46:17,540 --> 04:46:29,909
keep, hold on. Come here. Come over here. Go get it. Go get it. Yeah. Who's going to get the ball?

1264
04:46:29,909 --> 04:46:48,810
Oh, the bunny, bunny got adopted, right? What's wrong? Do you want a treat? There we go. Okay.

1265
04:46:48,810 --> 04:46:57,450
Very good. You have the same eyes as the Among Us guy because we're the same person. Okay. Everyone

1266
04:46:57,450 --> 04:47:02,619
seems to be in pretty good spirits. I think you guys are just tired. Yes. Okay. You're tired and

1267
04:47:02,619 --> 04:47:12,549
I think you're tired too. Yes. All right. So let me clean up your area here. I think, I think it's

1268
04:47:12,549 --> 04:47:20,470
time for Doofus to get adopted. Doofus needs a little bit more room. Yeah. Doofus needs some

1269
04:47:20,470 --> 04:47:40,150
more room. You want a treat? No, please. No, no. Someone else. Oh, look. Lassie, uh, grew up. You

1270
04:47:40,150 --> 04:47:49,400
need to get some sleep. Please. Not Doofus. What about, um, what about Husko? I think Husko needs,

1271
04:47:49,400 --> 04:48:09,659
Husko needs a lot of room. Yep. All right, Husko. We're going to get you a good family. Okay.

1272
04:48:09,659 --> 04:48:27,000
Where's Husko? All right, everybody. Let's find Husko a home. Oh, let me go to the birds. Birds

1273
04:48:27,000 --> 04:48:38,700
need a little bit of, uh, a little bit of care, I think. Right. I want to get out of the, please

1274
04:48:38,700 --> 04:48:53,259
let me get out of the laptop. You monster. What? I'm getting them in better homes. Here you go. Have

1275
04:48:53,259 --> 04:49:09,290
some food. Copium. What do you mean? What? I'm taking care of them until we can find them. I'm

1276
04:49:09,290 --> 04:49:16,380
fostering them until we can find them better homes. I'm not deleting them. It does not say

1277
04:49:16,380 --> 04:49:29,930
delete this dog. It says find a home. I'm not, nobody, what are you talking about? Here, have

1278
04:49:29,930 --> 04:49:41,180
some. Oh, you already have, do you already have food? Yeah, you're tired. Are you tired too? Yeah,

1279
04:49:41,180 --> 04:50:03,369
they're both just tired. Home. Copium. Huh? It says have them find a better, a new home. Look,

1280
04:50:03,369 --> 04:50:12,470
that's what it says. Morgan's Pet Care. I'm currently fostering animals and it says, okay,

1281
04:50:12,470 --> 04:50:20,500
so here's who is at my house. Find a new home. It doesn't, I didn't, move to hotel. Move to hotel

1282
04:50:20,500 --> 04:50:32,650
would be, no, this is, they come in and they, that's not what it says. It's not a funeral home.

1283
04:50:32,650 --> 04:50:44,360
Stop. You guys are fucked. Show us the homes. I don't, there's not that much in this. What?

1284
04:50:44,360 --> 04:51:11,689
Oh shit, I just went to sleep. Ah, bugs. Do you actually see the people? This one's really cool

1285
04:51:11,770 --> 04:51:28,180
looking. It's blue and orange. That's crazy. You're good. You're happy. Fill up your hay again.

1286
04:51:28,180 --> 04:51:35,819
Give you some more food. You still have leaves there. Hello. What's this guy's name? Fred.

1287
04:51:35,819 --> 04:51:51,459
What's turtle's name? Hello. I like doofus more than I like lassie. Oh, that was crunch. Right.

1288
04:51:51,459 --> 04:52:00,150
I wish I could take you out and kind of let you run around a little in a safe enclosed space.

1289
04:52:00,150 --> 04:52:10,470
You're doing good. How are you doing in here? It's filled. Oh, right. Fred got adopted. That's

1290
04:52:10,470 --> 04:52:21,479
right. Fred got adopted. Hope you're having a good time, Fred, in your new home. Uh, I just fed you.

1291
04:52:21,479 --> 04:52:38,419
How are you doing? Tired? You want to play here? I love how the dogs want to play with the cat toys

1292
04:52:38,419 --> 04:52:51,000
too. Are you tired doofus? No needs. All right. I think it's time to send out some more. I think

1293
04:52:51,000 --> 04:53:01,509
you're just tired. Yeah. You doofus just won't go to bed. How come doofus won't sleep? He just won't

1294
04:53:01,509 --> 04:53:10,119
go to bed. Fish. Uh, I don't, you don't feed the fish. They just kind of hang out. There's no

1295
04:53:10,119 --> 04:53:18,540
mechanic to feed them. Yeah. These guys are all full up with food. They're all good. How are you?

1296
04:53:18,540 --> 04:53:27,340
Maybe we should get some adoptions going here. Uh, you were adopted so I can get rid of that.

1297
04:53:38,790 --> 04:53:51,610
I, I want to adopt crunch. I want crunch to be adopted from me and I want scrumptious and doofus.

1298
04:53:51,610 --> 04:54:04,470
The rest are going to have good homes. Crunch. I'm keeping crunch. Actually, I'll keep lassie too.

1299
04:54:04,470 --> 04:54:23,849
I'll keep doofus. Uh, it's kind of glitched out. Okay. So I'm going to, I want crunch. I could keep

1300
04:54:23,849 --> 04:54:32,150
scrumptious. Oh, chivius would be so wonderful. Let's get chivius a new home. Eiffel. Eiffel will

1301
04:54:32,150 --> 04:54:42,840
do so good in a new home. Come on in. Adopt. Well, sweetie, we'll keep sweetie. Oh, the fish.

1302
04:54:42,840 --> 04:54:55,740
That's cool. We'll keep doofus. I, we'll keep spidey. We'll adopt out. Uh, we'll keep morbius.

1303
04:54:55,740 --> 04:55:03,430
All right. We have some, anybody want to come in and get the spiders? Oh, that's a hamster. I

1304
04:55:03,430 --> 04:55:10,900
feel like somebody would have a lot of fun with this hamster. Frumpy would have a lot of fun with

1305
04:55:10,900 --> 04:55:18,790
the new owner too. Keep spider four. This is, this is all temporary. I wanted to make sure that I

1306
04:55:18,790 --> 04:55:25,540
could house them. All right. Flappy. I'm going to, I'll keep one of the parrots. I'm going to keep

1307
04:55:25,540 --> 04:55:35,220
tweety. Some of these spiders though, I'll keep the blue spider. We'll find a new home for you.

1308
04:55:35,220 --> 04:55:39,779
The fish can all stay. And I think, I think I'm good. I think, wait, what about peaches?

1309
04:55:44,500 --> 04:55:54,810
They're going to a new home. A new home. This doesn't say a new death. This doesn't say a new

1310
04:55:54,810 --> 04:56:04,439
shelter. They're going to a new home. Home. H-O-M-E. H-O-M-E. H-O-M-E. H-O-M-E. H-O-M-E.

1311
04:56:04,439 --> 04:56:14,919
It doesn't say heaven. It doesn't say, no, it'll find a new H-O-M-E. Home. It says home. How come

1312
04:56:14,919 --> 04:56:21,659
you're adopting animals to give them away? No, I'm working with the pet adoption center. I'm working

1313
04:56:21,659 --> 04:56:36,169
with the adoption center. The new, oh my God. Isn't that guy, that's not adoption center.

1314
04:56:40,680 --> 04:56:46,840
You're being so gaslit right now. I know. And they deserve to be fucking yelled at.

1315
04:56:46,840 --> 04:56:55,060
Okay. So I got rid of this. These are all adopted. Very cool. The only thing, yeah, there was just

1316
04:56:55,060 --> 04:57:06,759
this, you were the only one. Hi. This chat is fucked. He's role playing. Yeah, I'm just,

1317
04:57:06,759 --> 04:57:16,009
I'm role playing. I'm role playing as a person that's like fostering animals and adopting them.

1318
04:57:16,009 --> 04:57:28,630
You deleted them. Where are all the huge dogs? What is the title of this fucking stream? I mean,

1319
04:57:28,630 --> 04:57:39,750
technically this was a huge dog house. So here we go. We've got two dogs, two cats, and our bird

1320
04:57:39,750 --> 04:57:59,159
friend out here. Perfect. Hello. Everyone is happy. Don't need these because I just need one. I don't

1321
04:57:59,159 --> 04:58:13,139
think Doofus has slept since he got here. Okay. Do you want a bigger bed? I wonder if it's, is it

1322
04:58:13,139 --> 04:58:20,009
the size? Does he, do you want a bigger bed? You're kind of a big dog. Are they big beds?

1323
04:58:20,009 --> 04:58:42,009
Open the bedroom. Okay. There we go. I don't even need a bedroom. This can just be another, okay.

1324
04:58:42,009 --> 04:58:52,680
Will you sleep in here if I put a, like a big bed in here? I wanted to get some sleep. Light dog

1325
04:58:52,680 --> 04:59:08,490
sleeping mat. Dog sleeping mat. Dog bed. Dog bed with legs. One of these big ones. Dog, dark dog

1326
04:59:08,490 --> 04:59:18,279
couch woof. Okay. This is extra large. How is that extra large? This doesn't look like an extra large

1327
04:59:18,279 --> 04:59:48,409
bed. That looks like a small bed. Why are these all so small? Okay. Hi. Yeah. He's not on follow.

1328
04:59:50,409 --> 04:59:55,689
Yeah. Get some, go get some rest. How are you doing? You doing happy? Doing good? Hey, look,

1329
04:59:55,689 --> 05:00:21,500
look at this. Oh, oh, are you gonna get it? Are you gonna get it? A little scrumptious. Are you

1330
05:00:21,500 --> 05:00:44,340
gonna go to bed? Finally? Good cat. I think you grew up. No, he's not on follow. Oh, snoozing. Keep

1331
05:00:44,340 --> 05:00:56,180
it open for now. You're doing okay. You're doing all right, but you're probably hungry. Yeah, come

1332
05:00:56,180 --> 05:01:11,930
over here. Want to play some yarn? Get it. Yeah, I don't, he's not on follow. Come here. Come with me.

1333
05:01:11,930 --> 05:01:17,610
I know you're very excited. It's very exciting stuff, but come over here. We'll put you in. It's

1334
05:01:17,610 --> 05:01:22,759
gonna be a quiet little space right over here. I know it's very exciting, but you should go

1335
05:01:22,759 --> 05:01:34,139
lie right in here. It's very exciting. There you go. Go on, lie down. Oh, no, get out of here.

1336
05:01:34,139 --> 05:01:46,169
He's trying to sleep. He doesn't want to go to bed. He's not on follow. Look, you just turn the

1337
05:01:46,169 --> 05:02:00,650
lights off. He's just too excited. Okay. Come over here and go lie in bed. I'm telling you.

1338
05:02:00,650 --> 05:02:22,919
Follow me. Okay. Follow me. Have they all been on follow me the whole time? Every single one?

1339
05:02:22,919 --> 05:02:38,840
I thought it was, I thought I had to click the follow me or click this. Really? What? No,

1340
05:02:39,479 --> 05:02:54,709
I didn't know that. I thought it was, but their default set to follow me. Okay. So in my brain,

1341
05:02:54,790 --> 05:03:03,619
this is not follow me, right? It's, he's under stay. See? I thought it was just,

1342
05:03:04,970 --> 05:03:22,040
now he's following me. He's so happy. I'm so happy. Thank God. Okay. So there you go.

1343
05:03:22,040 --> 05:03:30,419
You may have been the light switch. I think this room was off for a while too though.

1344
05:03:30,419 --> 05:03:40,330
How's everybody doing? Good. Just checking on everybody down here. Looking good. You still

1345
05:03:40,330 --> 05:03:56,650
have your egg. How are you anyways? How are you doing? Good. Just chilling. Don't do any more

1346
05:03:56,650 --> 05:04:26,009
adoptions. What? What are you talking about? He is not. He's fine. I think he's, I don't think

1347
05:04:26,009 --> 05:04:44,889
he's dead. I don't think he's dead. No, I don't think so. No, right? I think he's just sitting

1348
05:04:44,889 --> 05:05:00,619
there. I've been coming down here and putting food in and stuff. No, I don't, I don't think

1349
05:05:00,619 --> 05:05:17,220
they can die like that. No, I don't think so. No, look, look. Ready? Watch this. Watch. Ready?

1350
05:05:17,220 --> 05:05:40,540
Crunch is fine. He's fine. Look, this is him right here. It says he's fine. That's just an image.

1351
05:05:40,540 --> 05:05:46,659
No, why would I be able to move him around if he was? I think he's just bugged. I really do.

1352
05:05:46,659 --> 05:06:02,150
I honestly think he's bugged. Watch. Ready? Here's what we'll do. I'll prove it. Check this out.

1353
05:06:02,150 --> 05:06:10,919
Move to the hotel, okay? Pets in the hotel, okay? Pick from the hotel. Go back into your aquarium.

1354
05:06:10,919 --> 05:06:20,009
All these motherfuckers telling me that Crunch was dead. All these motherfuckers telling me

1355
05:06:20,009 --> 05:06:30,360
Crunch was dead. Everybody telling me Crunch was dead. I've been coming down here and been,

1356
05:06:31,319 --> 05:06:40,500
it's fine. Crunch just was, AI just walked into a wall for a second. Dude, you posted Crunch.

1357
05:06:40,500 --> 05:06:53,689
I've been feeding them. I've been having, I was right. I've been hanging out with them. How are

1358
05:06:53,689 --> 05:07:06,790
you doing? Good. I think you're sleeping down here. I think you're asleep down here. Oh no,

1359
05:07:06,790 --> 05:07:22,439
they were adopted. Yeah, everyone trying to tell me that Crunch, Crunch is perfectly fine. In fact,

1360
05:07:22,439 --> 05:07:26,279
let's get, because I know I'm keeping you, I can, you know, I'm going to bring you into the bedroom.

1361
05:07:26,279 --> 05:07:43,130
I think that's, I mean, I don't, nevermind. No, I'm not. Okay. How you doing? Doing good.

1362
05:07:43,130 --> 05:07:55,299
Everyone's doing good. I did, this hamster got adopted. So I can put you back over here in this

1363
05:07:55,299 --> 05:08:11,349
spot right here. Very cool. All right. Look at how happy you are. Very cool. Wanna play? Doofus.

1364
05:08:11,349 --> 05:08:27,080
Why do you hate doofus? How are you? It looks like you both have grown up. Need some sleep.

1365
05:08:27,080 --> 05:08:33,340
Make sure you're not on like follow, wait, so when it says follow me, that means it,

1366
05:08:33,340 --> 05:08:53,560
that they're staying, right? That's correct. So I have to click that. Happy, happy. Here, you wanna

1367
05:08:53,560 --> 05:09:05,110
play? Come, let's come, come outside. Let's get some exercise. Go get it. No, not doofus. Dude,

1368
05:09:05,110 --> 05:09:14,040
of course doofus is going to go get it. All right, doofus. Let's get you some exercise.

1369
05:09:14,040 --> 05:09:30,900
Doofus. There we go. All right. Come on out. Good catch. They don't, they're not really dirty. Yeah,

1370
05:09:30,900 --> 05:09:35,700
they look really clean. I'll get a cleaning station there right here. And then I'm probably

1371
05:09:35,700 --> 05:09:51,110
going to end the stream soon. I feel like I've done everything I wanted to do. You want to,

1372
05:09:51,110 --> 05:10:04,180
oh, well, okay. Well, now you're dirty. That you did not look like this before. Here you go.

1373
05:10:04,259 --> 05:10:24,840
You ready? Let's get clean. Very good. Do you need to clean? I don't think, I don't think you

1374
05:10:24,840 --> 05:10:30,040
do anything with the cats. You want to play? All right, here we go. Ready? This is for you.

1375
05:10:30,040 --> 05:10:44,889
I know I joked about the house, but I hope you had fun making it and the animals are very cute. Yeah,

1376
05:10:44,889 --> 05:11:04,569
it was fun. That's definitely a cool addition to the game. Go get it. Nice patch of grass.

1377
05:11:07,750 --> 05:11:17,700
It's fine. Don't worry. Everybody seems happy. I think, is doofus clean? Do you need to be clean?

1378
05:11:17,700 --> 05:11:51,779
No, you're fine. Fish is doing good. Very good. You don't feed the fish though. Everyone's having

1379
05:11:51,779 --> 05:11:58,790
such a good time. The fish are starving. I can't feed them. They're just, I think there's like an

1380
05:11:58,790 --> 05:12:07,860
auto feeder or something. They never used the cat wall. Yeah, they didn't. How do you, I wonder how

1381
05:12:07,860 --> 05:12:21,369
you get them to use it? Can you put them on it? Um, let me see if anyone will think it's fun.

1382
05:12:21,369 --> 05:12:29,240
Well, you're too tired. I don't want to do that. Where's uh, where's scrumptious? Scrumptious?

1383
05:12:29,240 --> 05:12:41,860
Where's scrumptious? How are you doing out here? You need food? No, you got, they got plenty of food.

1384
05:12:41,860 --> 05:12:56,020
Um, you might be stuck somehow. I think the game maybe has you stuck. Okay, I don't know. How did

1385
05:12:56,020 --> 05:13:27,880
that happen? He's going insane. I'm, hold on. All right. Tweety, we'll, we'll get Tweety adopted.

1386
05:13:27,880 --> 05:13:37,369
I don't, I can't, I can't fix Tweety. Tweety was stuck in the, on the seat or whatever it is. What?

1387
05:13:37,369 --> 05:13:45,639
I'm finding them new homes. You guys are fucked. All right. I think that's probably it. That was

1388
05:13:45,639 --> 05:13:55,849
fun. I didn't want to go too overboard because there's no way I, that was the limit of the

1389
05:13:55,849 --> 05:14:00,459
amount of animals I was able to reliably even take care of in the game. So I didn't want to

1390
05:14:00,459 --> 05:14:14,939
keep adding animals. How could you? Get them all adopted? Well, I, I, I can, I can take care of all

1391
05:14:14,939 --> 05:14:23,959
these. Two dogs, two cats, a couple of lizards. I'm okay with this. I'm not, no, I'm keeping them.

1392
05:14:23,959 --> 05:14:31,880
No, these, these are, these are my best friends. All the other ones were my good friends too, but

1393
05:14:31,880 --> 05:14:39,110
we got them new homes. If you turn the game off, they die. That's not true. They continue to live

1394
05:14:39,110 --> 05:14:47,259
here and have fun. This is a substantial update. I did not think there was going to be this much

1395
05:14:47,259 --> 05:14:53,340
stuff in it. There's a lot. This is really cute. It is really, that was really funny. That was really

1396
05:14:53,340 --> 05:15:03,290
cute. Start a dog sanctuary. Well, that's why I wanted to make sure I had enough beds and enough

1397
05:15:03,290 --> 05:15:11,659
food bowls. Once we got to like three, four dogs in the house, it was like, no more, no more. I

1398
05:15:11,659 --> 05:15:22,569
cannot take care of any more. The cat wall. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who's, um, can I see you

1399
05:15:22,569 --> 05:15:44,200
for a second? Your fridge is so ugly. All right. Will you want to hang out on this? I don't think

1400
05:15:44,200 --> 05:16:03,000
so. No, I just don't think they want to use it. I just don't think they like it. No, they're on

1401
05:16:03,000 --> 05:16:18,900
follow. Are they? Well, these two were playing, so we were just playing. Can I go to bed? Okay.

1402
05:16:18,900 --> 05:16:28,470
It does look cool. All right. Goodbye, Doofus. It has been fun. Goodbye, Scrumptious. Goodbye,

1403
05:16:28,470 --> 05:16:41,770
Doofus. Goodbye, David. Goodbye, Husko. Goodbye, Disc. Goodbye, Flappy. Goodbye, Lassie. Goodbye,

1404
05:16:41,770 --> 05:16:51,450
Crunch. Goodbye, Peaches. Goodnight, Morbius. Goodnight, the other ones, all the other animals.

1405
05:16:51,450 --> 05:17:02,150
Perfect. Goodnight, Fred. Goodnight, Morbius. All right. Yeah, that's it. That's it. That was fun.

1406
05:17:11,349 --> 05:17:20,310
That was a back stretch. Oh yeah, multiverses. Okay. So on Friday, we're going to play multiverses

1407
05:17:20,310 --> 05:17:31,099
for like 40 minutes and then we'll move on to something else. Was that a good stretch? That was

1408
05:17:31,099 --> 05:17:38,310
a really good stretch, actually. I feel great. They're not going to leave the hard drive.

1409
05:17:38,310 --> 05:17:43,560
It's fine. I'll see you guys on Friday. We're going to start with multiverses. I'm going to stream

1410
05:17:43,560 --> 05:17:48,200
earlier than four because if the, if it actually turns off at five o'clock Pacific,

1411
05:17:48,200 --> 05:17:53,860
I want to play for at least a couple hours. We'll start at like three, at least three-ish,

1412
05:17:53,860 --> 05:18:00,040
because I want at least an hour or two. Your arms look really small. Get a little of that.

1413
05:18:00,040 --> 05:18:14,919
Do they? Yeah. What'd you say? Would you excuse, say that again if you could? All right. Goodbye.

1414
05:18:14,919 --> 05:18:21,700
I'll see you guys Friday. That was House Flipper Pets DLC. I didn't even pee for five and a half

1415
05:18:21,700 --> 05:18:44,310
hours. That's kind of weird. It's fun taking care of pets. Who was your favorite? My favorite was

1416
05:18:44,310 --> 05:18:51,580
probably Doofus and Crunch. Mainly Crunch because everybody said he was dead, but he wasn't. He's

1417
05:18:51,580 --> 05:19:17,659
alive and I proved it. So they're my favorites. Scrumptious? Yeah. David? Yeah. So everyone was

1418
05:19:17,659 --> 05:19:40,869
so convinced that Crunch was dead. Unanimous in the chat. Unanimous. Now, see you Friday. We'll

1419
05:19:40,869 --> 05:19:45,750
start with multiverses and then from there, because I'm not going to be able to play that

1420
05:19:45,750 --> 05:19:54,900
game for more than an hour or two, from there we'll probably do, I don't know. I'll take a look at

1421
05:19:54,900 --> 05:20:01,349
the recommended. There's a ton of stuff in there. We'll probably do a pre-stream poll if you're

1422
05:20:01,349 --> 05:20:15,830
around. But yeah, take care of yourselves. Thanks for watching. See you again, hopefully. This stream

1423
05:20:15,830 --> 05:20:23,240
started kind of absurd, but I think we chilled out a little bit halfway through, but it's fun.

1424
05:20:23,240 --> 05:20:38,380
It's fun just to hang out. You should play Ultrakill. Yeah, I mean, if it's not in the

1425
05:20:38,380 --> 05:20:44,599
recommended already, toss it in there. I'll go take a look. What about more infomercials? Yeah,

1426
05:20:44,599 --> 05:20:54,659
we'll do that too. You're in the hospital today. Thanks for cheering me up. Hopefully you're

1427
05:20:54,659 --> 05:21:05,830
all right. Hopefully there's nothing serious or anything. When's the green screen? Green screen

1428
05:21:05,830 --> 05:21:12,939
in front of the green screen night. I'll let you know early this coming week. It's not, I'm not

1429
05:21:12,939 --> 05:21:17,659
going to get in front of the green screen for at least a couple weeks because I want some time

1430
05:21:17,659 --> 05:21:23,979
for people to do actions and I want some time for me to figure out when I want to get in front of

1431
05:21:23,979 --> 05:21:35,479
it. So it'll be at least a week or two from right now at least. Where can we submit actions? So

1432
05:21:36,439 --> 05:21:51,099
in the discord right now we have a channel. It is imminently about to be used. We're going to set

1433
05:21:51,099 --> 05:21:55,979
up a discussion channel to talk about actions. What you want me to do in front of the screen.

1434
05:21:56,619 --> 05:22:08,389
I think it's going to open probably soon. It is a public discord with some sub only channels.

1435
05:22:09,110 --> 05:22:14,790
It is the submissions green screen channel. Go please read the rules. There are a lot of them.

1436
05:22:16,540 --> 05:22:26,709
There are a lot of rules. I will give some more info on this. Well actually we'll talk in detail

1437
05:22:26,709 --> 05:22:42,459
about the kind of what I'm expecting on Friday. Yeah and also check on the already done actions

1438
05:22:42,459 --> 05:22:47,099
before you submit. We've done this two times now. This is the third time. I'm not going to do,

1439
05:22:48,060 --> 05:22:55,060
for instance, I mean maybe I will for my own sake for my own amusement. But if something,

1440
05:22:55,060 --> 05:22:58,979
if it's if I've already done it in front of the screen I'm not going to do it again in a week or

1441
05:22:58,979 --> 05:23:05,500
two. If we already have that footage then if it's already been submitted then think of something

1442
05:23:05,500 --> 05:23:27,349
else. Is it sub only submissions? No it is not. Yeah take care of yourselves. Thanks for watching.

1443
05:23:28,150 --> 05:23:36,380
Take care of your pets. Give your dog and cat some love or if you have any other pets too.

1444
05:23:36,939 --> 05:23:43,299
And I'll see you guys on Friday. And always of course call your mother of course.

1445
05:23:46,259 --> 05:23:48,099
All right good night guys. See you soon.
