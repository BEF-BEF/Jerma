1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:16,500
What are you guys doing? What is this? Stop writing that. Don't write that. What's wrong with you?

2
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:29,160
What is this? I don't get it. It's a it's a penis curse. I don't know what that means.

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:45,100
He doesn't know. No, I don't at all. I have no idea what you're doing. There's a lot of- wait,

4
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:59,560
is this a chant? Are you chanting? Yeah, twitch added copy to clipboard. You're chanting. You know

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:06,629
for the time that shit goes by too fast, you can't copy it and spam it fast enough. In comes

6
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:16,760
chanting. Making your life as a twitch viewer that much more simple. Uh, let me tweet this. I'll be

7
00:01:16,760 --> 00:02:29,460
right back. Okay. Hello. How are you? Today we're gonna play Fable 2, or at least start it and

8
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:38,360
play it for a little while. I think Fable 2 is like 12 to 16 hours. We'll see how far we get in two

9
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:47,560
days. I don't know. I don't know. We might go halfway Andy and I might just get to like 60%

10
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:55,580
of the way through the game and be like, nah, that was fun. You forgot the gif. You guys have

11
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,740
to understand, I've said this a bunch of times, but it's very very accurate. I need to make it

12
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:07,000
very clear. From the beginning of last stream to the end of last stream, I remembered that stuff

13
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,710
like an hour after that stream finished. Today, from the beginning of this stream, I don't have

14
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:21,129
any memory of almost anything that happened on the last stream. We're in a new period here.

15
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,189
I'll remember this shit for like the next probably few hours after the stream's over,

16
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:37,780
maybe tomorrow morning. I don't, there's too much for me to remember. What stream? The one

17
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,990
from last week. I know I played Resident Evil 8. I know I did like a Wile E. Coyote routine with

18
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:54,120
one of the werewolves. I remember the big lady. I remember like screaming a bunch of times. That's

19
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,550
it. That's pretty much it. I don't know anything else. I remember none of that happened. None of

20
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:09,689
us are real. There is something I do have to tell you, which I'm not necessarily happy with, but

21
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:18,579
next weekend on Sunday, I have somebody that has been blowing my phone up and

22
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:28,970
I have a contractual obligation kind of to let them stream. Let me just give it to you long and

23
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:37,879
short. They were pissed off that they weren't involved in a stream from last year and I get

24
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:45,339
texts from this person every like six days. Hey, is it cool? Can I do like my routine? I'm like,

25
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,420
no. I don't fucking want you. Look, you weren't there and the stream didn't happen, so I can't.

26
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:58,310
This person just fucking won't leave me alone, so I'm going to give them the opportunity to do a

27
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,189
routine for you, okay? That's next weekend. I don't have any idea what the fuck they're going

28
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:09,509
to do, but that's Sunday. I don't know if I wouldn't miss it if I were you. Maybe I would.

29
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:15,399
Depends on who you are. Depends on how you like anybody. Depends on how much you like somebody.

30
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,819
I don't know. They're going to have control and that's it. That's all you need to know. Sunday.

31
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,259
Either on Sunday. Next Sunday. Stream is on Sunday. Next Sunday. Be there. Or don't.

32
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:41,829
Ugh. Zero viewers. I don't, I have no idea. I don't want to tell you who it is.

33
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,250
Rather you just get surprised or not. But now we're going to play Fable 2. Probably play Fable

34
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:56,139
tomorrow. I'm going to do a two-day in a row of streams. You should stream at the same time.

35
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:09,500
I can't because they were supposed to be on my stream, so I can't do that. What if Fable sucks?

36
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:14,860
You know, if Fable sucks. I know. I played this game before. I played Fable 2.

37
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:22,420
I know what I'm getting into. Fable 2. Let me just make sure everything works.

38
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,740
I think this should be fine. This game was a lot of fun from what I remember.

39
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:35,259
I can't hear anything. Oh, there we go. Okay. I got to turn the volume up on my monitor.

40
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:51,959
It is far too low. There we go. Do we have any potions or food? That's good. So I'm going to try.

41
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:59,240
I know that you look like the streamer thing to do in these games is to get a hundred percent evil

42
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,540
points. I'm going to try to be a very good boy. I'm not going to like kill anybody. I'm not going

43
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,100
to hurt anybody. I'm not going to like kick any chickens and stuff and get yelled at. I'm going

44
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:19,220
to be a very extra good boy. I'm already seeing Resident Sleepers, but everybody does. Everybody

45
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,740
is evil. Everybody is like, oh, look at me. I'm evil. I have horns. I'm so bad. I'm evil.

46
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,189
I don't want to be evil. I want to be a good person. Don't Resident Sleeper that.

47
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:38,620
But who is the hero of our tale? I want to be a good boy. You're not going to be able to resist.

48
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,100
I'm going to try to be a good boy. I didn't say I was. Then let his destiny unfold.

49
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,149
Oh shit. I remember this part. You remember when I was like a kid, didn't they do the thing?

50
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:55,850
This is like Link grows up into like big Link, right? So many people tried to copy that shit

51
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,970
after they did that. Remember that? Remember Ocarina of Time? It was like, look, you play as

52
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:06,949
Link and then like your adult Link. Everybody desperately tried to do that too. All miserable

53
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:26,250
failures, by the way. This dude is ugly. Fucking 10 year old. What are you talking about? What?

54
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:43,159
He was talking about you. I'm not even on camera. This is Hogwarts. This is Harry Potter. This is

55
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:50,620
Hogwarts. The same intro happens. Wait, what? It is, right? The exact same thing happens.

56
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Nice graphics. This game is on Xbox 360. Oh, I have to test to make sure there's no delay.

57
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:16,840
This bird poop is going to land on my head, right? Someone's going to lean in and go,

58
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,559
here's a chicken chisel. Bird pooped on chicken chisel's head.

59
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:33,559
I hear that's lucky, like finding a four leaf clover.

60
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:42,500
Why is there snow floating around? Is this snow or is this like fucking ash? Use LT to focus on

61
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:53,460
important events. It's a volcanic winter. I bet Lord Lucian's having roast duck this time of year,

62
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,830
but he must be really lonely since his wife and his little girl died

63
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:16,629
in that big castle all by himself. I don't even live in there. Oh, the town party. Follow the

64
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:26,899
glowing trail. Oh yeah, I forgot they did. Oh my God, this is ugly. This is really ugly. I forgot

65
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:39,879
like 360 looks like shit. That's rude. Follow the glowing trail to your next objective.

66
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,309
I don't remember it looking like this. Do I just?

67
00:10:50,389 --> 00:11:08,220
I remember this. I say this on stream all the time.

68
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:19,700
I say this all the time. Yes, I do.

69
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:27,590
I've never said it. Yes, I have.

70
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:38,139
Unassuming box is actually a device created by the ancients.

71
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:46,059
Why would I even know that I said that if I didn't say it?

72
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,860
There's no such thing as magic. I feel like these

73
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,460
look like electrified. We live in grim times indeed. If the young are too world weary to

74
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:07,740
believe in magic, most children your age believe eagerly. I can see your eyes too much

75
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:16,259
fucking lit up snow. That's what the seller thinks. He has no idea what he stumbled upon,

76
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,889
but you have an inkling, don't you? Some part of you wants to believe it.

77
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,490
Why does the snowflakes have bloom on them? That seems so bizarre.

78
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,899
You really think it could be this looks like fucking radioactive.

79
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:39,110
You could have your answer. Listen to me, Rose. At the end of that week,

80
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,509
you and your little sparrow would be no closer to your dream, no closer to the inside of that

81
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:47,370
beautiful castle. We need five gold pieces.

82
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:53,750
I bet we could get five gold pieces, and maybe this could be a way out of here after all.

83
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,789
How does it look for you guys? It looks terrible for me. It looks awful. I'm looking at the OBS

84
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:07,529
monitor. It looks better through the OBS monitor than it does on my screen. It actually looks

85
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:16,139
better on the preview monitor. Okay, I need five gold pieces. This is to teach you the morality,

86
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:33,620
right? Okay. It doesn't look too bad. All right, earn gold by finding the arrest

87
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:40,299
warrants for Albion's most ruthless criminals. This is reminding me how much I hate this game.

88
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:48,440
Okay. Nobody hates this game. They hate the guy that made this game. This game is actually fun,

89
00:13:49,879 --> 00:14:08,250
kind of. All right, let's go get them. All right, let's go. So we're looking for warrants. No,

90
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:20,759
it's because of the snow. This is fine. I'll get used to this. Oh, thank God there's an imbecile

91
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:35,620
trail. All right, let's go. How about Barnum by posing for a picture for one gold piece?

92
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,980
Blur is disgusting.

93
00:14:45,539 --> 00:15:11,940
How come this is not PC? That's kind of weird. Beer goggles? How do I pose? I just farted. I

94
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:25,190
didn't want to do that. I was supposed to be a good boy. Okay, well, I'm already a bad boy.

95
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:37,190
Already evil? No, not yet. Farting isn't evil. It's a natural part of your body's ecosystem.

96
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:45,299
Imagine thinking farting is evil. All right, we gotta find warrants.

97
00:15:46,419 --> 00:16:01,129
This guy might have a warrant. Oh, what? Why is he glowing? Oh, friendly villager. Okay. Can I go

98
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:08,580
out here? I'm gonna turn the game on. No, okay. Once the snow is gone, everyone will be like,

99
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:14,840
this is fine. All right, what about this way? That guy who did that. Oh, thank God for the

100
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:34,970
imbecile leader. What happened? Hey, don't do that. All right, let's kick his ass. Hey,

101
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:40,730
my God, she just dropped. She's like unconscious. I don't remember this part of the game.

102
00:16:40,809 --> 00:17:13,700
All right, so where's the money? Oh, wait, that was for free. All right,

103
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,559
we're good people. We're just a good boy for free. What about the dog? Is the dog okay?

104
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:31,269
How do we help the dog? Oh, yeah. You get a dog, don't you?

105
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:38,390
We don't have enough food for ourselves. I remember this part of the game. This is like

106
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,710
the best part of the whole game was that they're very realistic dog. I remember,

107
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,299
didn't Peter Molyneux make a huge deal about this? It was like the dog who spent 6,000 days

108
00:17:50,299 --> 00:18:05,660
animating the dog. Oh, I got good boy points there. I don't want bad boy points. Oh, here we go.

109
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:16,650
The dog. All right, what does this do? Clear Balthazar's warehouse of beetles or smashers

110
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,309
stock. What do you mean smash? I can smash his stuff?

111
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:51,269
All right, so don't break anything. Sir, you are going to have to go through the proper authorities.

112
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:04,009
I am not going to do that. Certified good boy Jeremy Albertson. All right, where are the bugs?

113
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:23,500
Why does this kid have a... That's boring. Holy shit. Smash. No. How am I supposed to be certified

114
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:30,069
good boy Jeremy Albertson if I'm... No, I'm not going to break anything. Don't you understand?

115
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:34,470
We have to have something event happen in our life to create us our origin story to be the villain.

116
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:41,700
The Joker wasn't the fucking Joker when he was like 8. He was a good boy.

117
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:51,940
That was a massacre. No mercy for the filthy buggers. That's what I like to see.

118
00:19:54,869 --> 00:20:02,950
You weren't supposed to kill them. Now I think about it. I wonder how those beetles got in there.

119
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,630
Yes, he was. I watched the cartoon. What did you say? Did you say the cartoon?

120
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:12,859
I didn't know you were so good at fighting. We're really doing it.

121
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,750
Here we go. More decision making. I need two drinks.

122
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:26,680
Cover the stolen bottle. Where are the warrants? So you'll bring me back my bottle? Yes.

123
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:36,980
You'll find it and bring it to me, won't you children? Oh, okay. So we have to bring the

124
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:44,789
bottle and bring it to this lady because we're a good boy. Oh, hi dog. What'd you find? A warrant.

125
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:57,099
Nice. Nice find. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I know. You're sweet. No, I'm the good boy.

126
00:20:57,099 --> 00:21:05,180
But I told you before. We can't keep you. Come on, little sparrow. What did we find?

127
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:25,509
The warrant! Any Carmen Sandiego fans here? I guess not.

128
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,660
All right, more warrants. That's why. No, put the gun down. No, put the sword down and put the gun

129
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:52,660
down. Put the gun away. Oh my God, my face. Put it down. No, how do I just put it away?

130
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:18,279
Don't wake him up. How do I sneak? How do I sneak? There is no sneak.

131
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:28,460
Run. All right, return the wine to Pete. All right, we're going to return it to Betty.

132
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:39,769
We're a good boy. Hard on them. Fine. I'm a good boy, but I do bad things.

133
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:47,900
Is that possible?

134
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,670
Wait, what?

135
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,009
So we both we get a gold piece no matter what. So let's just do the good thing.

136
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:25,059
Yeah, I'm good. Take it. I think you guys are misunderstanding this.

137
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:32,009
We need to build up a hundred good boy points. Do good things. So then when I lose a hundred

138
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:38,089
points for drop kicking somebody through a window, I'm fine. I'm still normal. Did you get it?

139
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:54,869
All right, we got three gold pieces. Three gold pieces. All right, I think there's more warrants

140
00:23:54,869 --> 00:24:05,700
up here. Wait, what does it say? Read? Brookridge. You know what's really important, too? We have to

141
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,220
decide. I'm gonna have to do a poll. Because we have to pick, right? Like melee, ranged,

142
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:24,420
or magic. Melee, ranged, or magic. It's a big decision. Magic, magic, magic, magic.

143
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:35,099
Range, range, range, ranged. Let's go back to the guard. Melee, melee, melee, melee, melee. Hey,

144
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:45,799
kids. Oh, cool. A fart party. Why can I do it? How come I can't do it? I could show all these

145
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:51,369
kids like who's the best, the biggest farts. All right, I'm leaving. How come I can't do it?

146
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:11,849
Uh-oh. Stop right there. Shut it, girl. This isn't about that. Those warrants you're collecting.

147
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:20,009
Oh, really? So does our friend the guard. Yeah, but you're gonna give them to me. See?

148
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:25,450
I'm just gonna pop this guy. Otherwise, there'll be trouble. There'll be trouble, all right?

149
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,329
You take these, and I'll tell our friend what you really want.

150
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,380
All right, you little hard case. What's he paying you? A gold piece?

151
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:42,740
Well, yeah, a nice premium you're paying me. One gold piece? You pay me a three gold piece premium

152
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:50,359
to even consider this shit. Get the fuck out of here. Did you not understand crime? Like,

153
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,799
you don't understand how this works? I would have considered it for three or four gold pieces.

154
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,039
You're gonna give me the same that I would get for bringing it to the guard?

155
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,910
Do you even understand fucking crime? My empire begins now.

156
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:10,779
Thanks. I've savored. Now, normally, justice is its own reward. But as these aren't normal

157
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:16,619
circumstances, there's your gold piece. Okay, I need one more. Let's pick my nose.

158
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:22,089
That just sold out this town. You just need one more.

159
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:27,140
What is this? What are we doing here? I think mother heard us.

160
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:39,059
He's an evil good boy. I- unlike the- unlike the spectrum of good, bad, like, evil, does evil

161
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:43,779
things, does good things. I just want us to be just orbiting around in a circle,

162
00:26:43,779 --> 00:27:04,700
around that whole spectrum. Magic? 71% magic. What the fuck? Speak to Monty.

163
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,380
Are you an anti-hero or an anti-villain? Yes.

164
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:27,539
Why'd you ask me then? Maybe we could help you.

165
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:32,019
Hyperactive good boy with villainous tendencies. Where's that one?

166
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:35,220
You can take my proposal letter to the fair maiden. Oh, there is hope.

167
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,500
My heart soars in my chest like- Oh, you know who it would be?

168
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:40,420
I would be Loki from Marvel. That's who I want to be.

169
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:47,099
We'll do it for a gold piece. Oh, I'm a bit strapped right at the moment.

170
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,890
But Belinda's good for it. I'm sure she'll pay you when she receives my letter.

171
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:57,180
All right, deliver the letter to Monty's beloved. Let's do it.

172
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:06,970
Give us the money. Don't let her mom get it.

173
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,369
Oh, wait. Okay, so let's just give it right to the mom?

174
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:14,220
What's the good thing to do here? Deliver it to mom.

175
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:21,670
Just say, hey, there's this guy outside. Is that James Corden?

176
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:28,869
I don't know. I didn't know who that was until I had to think about it for a second.

177
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,150
And thinking about it for more than two seconds, I just saw in my brain

178
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:39,109
a profile shot of him in a car bouncing around singing a song with his hands on the wheel.

179
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:41,190
And then, oh, okay, now I know who the fuck that is.

180
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:54,279
What do you want? We've got a letter. We need one gold for the postage.

181
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,920
Kath, there's more than one British person.

182
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,269
There is more than one British person on Earth. Yes.

183
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:10,680
Don't you touch anything.

184
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,880
Okay, I'm a good person that does bad things sometimes, right?

185
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,710
Monty told us not to give it to the mother. But she'll pay us if we just wait here.

186
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,670
But then if we give it to Belinda upstairs, maybe they can run away together.

187
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,220
What's the good thing? I don't know what's good. What's easiest?

188
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,940
I don't know. You put these things somewhere so no one can find them and then you can't find them.

189
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,500
Letting the mother have it would be easiest.

190
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,859
Look, I have a letter for you, but it's going to require one specific thing.

191
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:50,789
I'm going to need one gold coin and two of your finest pieces of jewelry you have in the house.

192
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:52,710
This is how crime works, okay?

193
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,710
Do I need to explain it to you?

194
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,259
Shouldn't I be in school?

195
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:08,779
I don't know. Was there school back in like...

196
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:15,579
In like the 1500s? Did kids go to school in like the 1400s?

197
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,779
I don't think so.

198
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,019
No. When did... Okay, when was the first school?

199
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,119
Oh, I'm missing like the important stuff. Hold on. Watch out.

200
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,859
Oh wait, I can...

201
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,140
Rude. Point and laugh.

202
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:04,940
Social. Okay. Thumbs up.

203
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:10,460
Oh, look at me.

204
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:12,779
Maybe you should marry her instead.

205
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:14,660
What am I doing?

206
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:35,109
What was that? What is scary? Bloodlust?

207
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:41,269
Where did this kid come from? Why is there a kid in here?

208
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,150
No, I'm good. I just do bad things.

209
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:50,710
I'm scaring this kid.

210
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,990
That really is awful.

211
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,400
All right, get out, get out, get out, get out. Time to leave, leave, leave.

212
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:09,319
I was just trying to scare a kid. Art on the kid. No.

213
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:16,569
All right, let's buy the music box.

214
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,380
Okay.

215
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,960
24th and 23rd century BC established the first school. Okay.

216
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:49,779
Why when getting an item in the description?

217
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:51,700
Oh, a chicken. I didn't want to do that.

218
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,180
I wanted to like pet... I just pressed A.

219
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,019
I did not know it was going to kick the chicken.

220
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:07,269
I already ruined it. All right, let's use it.

221
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,420
Oh, make a portal to another dimension.

222
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,589
Or whatever this does.

223
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,839
Right now, the production company's splash screen comes up.

224
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:36,170
The black screen.

225
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,490
What?

226
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,700
Oh, the dog.

227
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:58,359
Well, I'm glad the box didn't take us because...

228
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,940
Dr. Ruff.

229
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,110
R-U-F-F. That's Dr. Ruff PhD.

230
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:25,460
We're gonna have like a dream or something.

231
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:38,070
Quiet, boy. What do you want?

232
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,829
I work for Lord Lucian, miss.

233
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,030
And he would very much like to see you in his castle.

234
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,309
I've been sent to collect you.

235
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,230
Who's this kid?

236
00:34:56,809 --> 00:34:59,289
Wait, did I like teach this kid how to do weird things?

237
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,050
Why is this kid in the house?

238
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:06,329
Who is this kid here?

239
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,400
Is this a party member?

240
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,239
All right. Well, cool.

241
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:17,800
Thanks, kid.

242
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:19,909
Does dog shit on him?

243
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:21,429
Wait, what's that?

244
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:24,869
I can't...

245
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:25,989
Oh, here we go.

246
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:35,610
Oh, he hates me.

247
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,809
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

248
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:47,530
Get out of here. Get out of my house.

249
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,099
It took a while for his AI to figure out what I wanted to do there.

250
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:03,820
All right, let's go.

251
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:07,380
Oh, wait a minute.

252
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,800
They're coming to get us.

253
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,320
Go to Castle Fairfax.

254
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,809
Hold on to the emote.

255
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:25,429
You see, why did anyone like this game?

256
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:28,230
I mean, this game 15 years ago was pretty...

257
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:29,110
It was pretty good.

258
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:36,940
Okay.

259
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,679
Yeah, we're very like special children, right?

260
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:01,429
Okay, I can't fart.

261
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:01,929
Sorry.

262
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:10,570
This is the best fable?

263
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,090
I think that's accurate.

264
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,679
Why is this still...

265
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,460
Bro, you're playing on an Xbox.

266
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,739
Yeah, Xbox 360.

267
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,420
Oh, I know the whole story.

268
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,139
I forgot.

269
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:32,340
You don't care if I spoil the whole game?

270
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,380
Okay. All right.

271
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:40,880
I won't.

272
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,920
All right, all right.

273
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,420
Yeah, we won't.

274
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,110
This story is so funny.

275
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,230
This is just a Minecraft sword.

276
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,269
From like the 1200s.

277
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,389
All right, well, let's go.

278
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:36,889
Let me in.

279
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:43,579
Hello.

280
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:55,110
Oh, he's evil, right?

281
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:01,909
What was your wish?

282
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:02,409
Exactly.

283
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:06,090
Yes, my lord.

284
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,849
You sold it to us.

285
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:08,809
Said it was magic.

286
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,449
The boxes have no interest to me.

287
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,210
What's remarkable is that you...

288
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,530
Yeah, the sideburns are like Pinocchio for evil people.

289
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,570
The bigger your sideburns, the more evil you really are.

290
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,179
If they're like an inch down, like I write, you're kind of a dick.

291
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:26,659
This far, this guy is a fucking horrible person.

292
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,480
Like this guy is an awful tyrant that has probably killed thousands of people.

293
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,900
Perhaps that could be arranged.

294
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,250
I am working to rebuild something wonderful.

295
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,610
For which I need individuals with particular talents.

296
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:45,349
Let us find out if...

297
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,269
If you're bald, you're good.

298
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:49,750
Would you kindly stand in the circle, please?

299
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,159
Oh, would you kindly?

300
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,119
I'll do it.

301
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:52,519
He said it.

302
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,159
He said the thing.

303
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,119
I promise.

304
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,690
All right, well, yeah, right.

305
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,730
This is like a...

306
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:13,639
You want me to get on there, too?

307
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,960
Stand at the center.

308
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,909
Like this guy's eyeing me from across the bar.

309
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:28,550
You know what I mean?

310
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,309
Like what did I do?

311
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:31,510
Why does this guy fucking hate me?

312
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,469
What's going on?

313
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:35,130
What did I do?

314
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,610
Now, we're junior heroes.

315
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:03,500
Oh, come on.

316
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,400
Come on.

317
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,039
That's Donald Duck from fucking Kingdom Hearts.

318
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,000
Get out of here.

319
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,239
That's...

320
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,039
I give myself a plus two.

321
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:10,440
I don't care.

322
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,159
Run.

323
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:30,159
Get down, sis.

324
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:41,340
I couldn't stand in front of her.

325
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:55,900
We just shot like a little kid.

326
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,800
I'm sure there was some other way to do...

327
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:24,570
To handle this.

328
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,969
Thanks for like letting us go get a fucking music box.

329
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:27,769
And like...

330
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:30,090
My like sister gets shot and I get thrown out of a window.

331
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:30,889
Thanks, lady.

332
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:41,260
A thousand foot drop.

333
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,260
Yeah, I like hit my head on the side of a building, too.

334
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:52,199
There's no way I survived, though.

335
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,000
Lucian disappeared from Castle Fairfax that night.

336
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,480
Certain that those who might stand in his way were dead.

337
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,119
But some grief is so great, even death may keep its distance.

338
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,440
And so the boy survived.

339
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,079
Days later, far from the dark alleys of Bowerstone,

340
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,039
life slowly returned to his small broken body.

341
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:16,280
The boy awoke to a familiar face watching over a strange bed.

342
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,400
He reached out for the comfort of the dog's warm fur.

343
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,599
Yeah, that was an interesting thing to get right after that cutscene.

344
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,159
Oh, like a little girl gets shot and you get thrown out of the window and like die.

345
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,400
Be careful not to hold the fart button down or you'll shit your pants.

346
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:41,239
Not really appropriate place for that tip, I don't think.

347
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,289
Ah, there you are.

348
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,849
And your faithful friend, too.

349
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:52,349
Right.

350
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:56,260
Many years ago, I promised I would help you avenge your sister's death.

351
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,400
That day has come.

352
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,440
Today, you leave the safety of this camp and seek out Lucian.

353
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,760
The journey will not be easy.

354
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,750
There's a chest near your caravan.

355
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,309
Oh, nice.

356
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:17,469
Meet me by the gates when you're ready to leave.

357
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:19,070
Is this where I get to learn magic?

358
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:23,949
I can't wait.

359
00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:28,909
I'm going to start to learn the fire spell, the ice spell, the wind spell, the lightning spell.

360
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:35,780
Oh, can't you buy stuff?

361
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,920
You can buy this house.

362
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,360
Once you own it, you can choose to live there and receive special bonuses or rent it out to any.

363
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:41,860
Oh, wow.

364
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,619
How much do I have now?

365
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:54,480
Make sure you put your house up for rent before you leave.

366
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,210
Oh, shit.

367
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:56,710
Okay.

368
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,949
I don't have any weapons.

369
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:02,829
Where's my house?

370
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,719
Buy and move in, buy and rent out.

371
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:13,679
How much money do I have?

372
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:14,639
I have zero dollars.

373
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:15,280
I don't have any money.

374
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:22,159
That's yeah, I get his name right.

375
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,159
That's Dr. Ruff PhD.

376
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:30,500
Turn safety off?

377
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:32,739
What?

378
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:33,780
Do I have a gun?

379
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,340
What does that mean?

380
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,460
Turn safety off.

381
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,820
Is that a secondary fart?

382
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,739
Your actions have affected your purity.

383
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:04,460
What?

384
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,050
What do you mean my purity?

385
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:11,179
What?

386
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:12,300
I'm no longer pure?

387
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,260
Someone has just tried flirting with you.

388
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,269
Why not try flirting back?

389
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,539
Who?

390
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,400
What is flirt?

391
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:28,860
You got the attention of somebody.

392
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,780
Everyone wants to have my attention.

393
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,019
All right.

394
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:37,489
How about who likes me?

395
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:43,579
You like that?

396
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,690
Do I just keep doing this?

397
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:52,610
Everybody loves me.

398
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:54,909
All right.

399
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:55,789
I don't want to do this yet.

400
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:00,690
The villagers attracted to you.

401
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,369
You can use flirty, fun, and social expressions to make them like you.

402
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:05,650
Maybe even marry you.

403
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:08,900
Okay.

404
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,059
Don't you think that's a little quick?

405
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,260
I just woke up in the town and I'm going to have like a wife immediately.

406
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:22,579
You and I are now we're in love.

407
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:25,949
Oh, by the way, get you a man that can do this.

408
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:44,289
I mean, we're going to get married?

409
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,210
It's too...

410
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,170
It's so early.

411
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:49,250
It's so early for this.

412
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,050
I don't even know what this person is.

413
00:47:52,929 --> 00:47:54,559
Are we married?

414
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:17,500
Okay.

415
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,699
So what is it?

416
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:19,019
Time?

417
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:20,380
Now what happens?

418
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,969
Okay.

419
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,489
I think somebody's in love with me.

420
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:28,110
Okay.

421
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:33,059
Um, flirty, a row of pickup line.

422
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:33,460
Here we go.

423
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:38,289
Okay.

424
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:39,570
Now what?

425
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:44,929
Turn safety off and start swinging at everybody.

426
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:45,170
No.

427
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,289
Nobody hates me here.

428
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:53,570
Hey, why does everybody hate me?

429
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,769
Everybody's supposed to love me.

430
00:48:54,769 --> 00:49:02,690
Okay.

431
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,050
So let's get, get me out of here.

432
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:08,050
Now what do I do?

433
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,480
Give gift.

434
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,360
You have no items.

435
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:16,860
A birthday?

436
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:32,699
Oh God, that's disgusting.

437
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:43,730
What am I doing in public?

438
00:49:44,929 --> 00:49:45,889
What am I doing?

439
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:50,860
Yeah.

440
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:54,289
All right.

441
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:55,010
I have to leave.

442
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,449
I need to like do a mission or something.

443
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:57,489
What the fuck am I doing?

444
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:02,130
You are loved by enough people to be Albion's dumpling?

445
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:05,659
What?

446
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:09,409
Oh, plus 34 hate.

447
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:09,650
What?

448
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:15,869
Albion's dump truck.

449
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:24,500
All right.

450
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,019
I have to get out of here.

451
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:31,789
Somebody say, somebody just say I'm going to puke.

452
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,389
I'm going to puke.

453
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,369
All right.

454
00:50:42,369 --> 00:50:43,170
I'm going to leave.

455
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:43,570
Goodbye.

456
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,010
It was really fun.

457
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:50,179
Now I press down to use the follow expression to lead villages to places they like.

458
00:50:50,909 --> 00:50:51,550
Oh shit.

459
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:51,869
All right.

460
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,300
Follow me.

461
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:00,019
Okay.

462
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:00,260
All right.

463
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,500
Let's go.

464
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,900
Let's go.

465
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,019
But where are we going?

466
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:07,260
I don't have any items into a bed.

467
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:07,739
Oh shit.

468
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:07,980
Okay.

469
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:09,579
Where's my bed?

470
00:51:09,579 --> 00:51:10,619
Do I have a bed?

471
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:15,789
This is my house.

472
00:51:15,789 --> 00:51:16,349
Oh, okay.

473
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:16,750
Let's go.

474
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:30,880
Wait, why do I have what are we doing?

475
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:33,280
Okay.

476
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,769
You ready to let's go to bed.

477
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,239
Wait, I can't.

478
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,280
I don't think I can do this.

479
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:14,019
This villager wants to marry you.

480
00:52:14,019 --> 00:52:20,849
I thought that said rest for 20, rest for seven days.

481
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,980
Oh my god.

482
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,480
That's too much.

483
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:27,139
Hold on.

484
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:28,179
Wait, wait.

485
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:33,869
I need to get my items.

486
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:37,519
There we go.

487
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:38,159
I need a ring.

488
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:40,159
It's like 10 million dollars for a ring.

489
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:47,809
Okay.

490
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:48,849
Rusty long sword.

491
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:49,650
I'll use it.

492
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,059
I'll use it.

493
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,429
Take it.

494
00:52:54,429 --> 00:52:55,710
Dog elixir.

495
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,420
Caller of holding.

496
00:52:58,449 --> 00:52:59,329
Spade.

497
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:00,719
Okay.

498
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:13,170
STD speed run.

499
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:13,570
Don't.

500
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:14,210
No.

501
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,610
Wait, that can happen.

502
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,329
That doesn't happen, right?

503
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:24,610
Someone just tried flirting with you.

504
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:29,019
Is this the same person?

505
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:33,760
No, this is different.

506
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,360
This is a different person.

507
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:46,769
Rent your house.

508
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,159
Hold on.

509
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:59,969
Okay.

510
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:01,550
Rent out.

511
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:02,750
Base value 800.

512
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,389
Final price.

513
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:04,429
All right, let's rent out.

514
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:11,150
A delightful caravan that has traveled far across Albion.

515
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:11,789
Okay.

516
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:16,320
Make sure you want to rent out this property.

517
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,960
Yes.

518
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,550
Cool.

519
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:21,789
All right.

520
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:30,659
Whoa, you got a gift?

521
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:32,989
Give someone a gift.

522
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:46,539
I'm not gonna give her a caller.

523
00:54:46,539 --> 00:54:47,579
Gotta get out of here.

524
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,369
I gotta get out of here.

525
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:53,329
I'm getting out of here.

526
00:54:53,329 --> 00:54:54,769
I'm gonna do the mission.

527
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:57,739
I'm gonna do the mission.

528
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,670
No, everyone get away from me.

529
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,670
No, I'm not giving anybody a caller.

530
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,289
The villager wants to marry you?

531
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:07,260
Not yet.

532
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,019
Let me do like a mission first.

533
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:27,889
Why am I walking so slow?

534
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:29,090
Take this.

535
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,380
She's still following me.

536
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,059
Bower Lake Tomb seal.

537
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,320
Are you gonna keep following me?

538
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:54,449
Oh.

539
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:07,070
Okay.

540
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,780
Enter Bower Lake Tomb.

541
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:15,019
Throw it out.

542
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:18,750
Jock it out.

543
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,630
Big spot.

544
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,309
Oh, cool.

545
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:21,469
Nice.

546
00:56:21,469 --> 00:56:21,710
All right.

547
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,719
Let's dig.

548
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:26,159
Give the dog the caller.

549
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:29,280
What'd I get?

550
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,369
A rubber ball.

551
00:56:32,369 --> 00:56:36,829
You can find books that will train your dog

552
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:38,510
to find even more valuable hidden treasures.

553
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:38,989
All right.

554
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:40,030
You want to play with the ball?

555
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,900
You want me to throw the ball, I think.

556
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,500
While near your dog, you can throw the ball.

557
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,710
All right.

558
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:48,349
Come here.

559
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:49,070
Let's do it.

560
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:51,260
You ready?

561
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:56,510
Here we go.

562
00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:02,909
Go get it.

563
00:57:02,909 --> 00:57:04,619
Go get it.

564
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:05,179
What?

565
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:08,960
Go get the ball.

566
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,199
No.

567
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:09,519
All right.

568
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:14,800
I'll throw it this way.

569
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,760
Go get it this way.

570
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,489
Come on.

571
00:57:17,489 --> 00:57:19,090
Come on.

572
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,130
I want to throw it for you.

573
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:20,929
Come here.

574
00:57:20,929 --> 00:57:22,849
You threw it off a cliff.

575
00:57:23,489 --> 00:57:24,929
It just dives.

576
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:28,530
You threw it off a cliff.

577
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:28,690
All right.

578
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:29,650
Well, how about this time?

579
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,730
Oh, the jump is safe.

580
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:31,889
Okay.

581
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:32,050
All right.

582
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:32,610
Come here.

583
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:38,289
I'm not going to throw it that far.

584
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,739
Ready?

585
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:41,780
Go get it.

586
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,840
Get it.

587
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,949
Go get it.

588
00:57:45,949 --> 00:57:49,699
Did you get it?

589
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,519
You're kind of stupid.

590
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:53,010
It's like right there.

591
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,949
Go get it.

592
00:57:55,949 --> 00:58:09,039
How many balls do I have?

593
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:10,800
That was such a good job.

594
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,099
Let's go.

595
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:19,679
What'd you find?

596
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:20,670
Treasure?

597
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:25,150
Oh my god.

598
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,110
You found a treasure.

599
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:35,519
It is a jet.

600
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:37,440
Nice job.

601
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,639
Good job.

602
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:41,170
Good boy.

603
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,369
Good dog.

604
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:44,480
Such a good dog.

605
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,920
You did such a good dog.

606
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,780
Did the dog swim?

607
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:57,019
All right.

608
00:58:57,019 --> 00:58:57,340
Let's go.

609
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,679
I love that dog.

610
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:13,630
Is there like a aim?

611
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,190
Okay.

612
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:21,039
You called him dumb?

613
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:23,070
I mean, I said he was kind of dumb.

614
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:25,969
I didn't say he's dumb.

615
00:59:25,969 --> 00:59:27,250
Therefore, I hate this dog.

616
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,449
I said he's a little dumb.

617
00:59:28,449 --> 00:59:29,090
That's okay.

618
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:36,539
He's a doctor.

619
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:42,159
Find the Chamber of Fate.

620
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:47,460
I'm speaking to you through the Guild Seal.

621
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,019
He's scared.

622
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,380
You will need to jump into that.

623
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,090
It's okay.

624
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:51,570
Don't worry.

625
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:54,139
The water at the bottom will break your fall.

626
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:59,380
This dog is...

627
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,980
This is a dumb doctor.

628
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,059
Well, we both have...

629
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:03,420
We all have to go in here, right?

630
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:03,659
All right.

631
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:04,300
Let's go in.

632
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,780
Let's go.

633
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:15,280
Where is he?

634
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:21,340
Holy shit.

635
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:31,630
Uh-oh.

636
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:35,039
Time for the first battle of the game.

637
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,610
Besides that kid.

638
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:39,630
Oh.

639
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:40,190
Oh.

640
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:46,539
That was sick.

641
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:47,820
Lock onto your target.

642
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,619
Tap left or right to change which target you're going to focus on.

643
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:59,170
You can attack any object or person that glows red.

644
01:00:59,170 --> 01:00:59,730
Yes, you can.

645
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,590
Those poor beetles.

646
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,590
Oh, that's right.

647
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:07,869
I forgot about this.

648
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:10,590
You have to kill things with a certain specialty

649
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,190
to get experience for that specialty.

650
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,150
I remember now.

651
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:13,630
I get it.

652
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,320
Yep.

653
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:16,880
I remember.

654
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:18,849
Use magic?

655
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:19,809
I don't have any magic.

656
01:01:20,369 --> 01:01:29,150
It's like Warframe.

657
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:32,210
Silver key.

658
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:32,849
Look at the dog.

659
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:33,250
I love it.

660
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:41,019
Is that Warframe was?

661
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:41,900
Warframe?

662
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,170
Warframe.

663
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:43,809
Sorry.

664
01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:51,260
All right.

665
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,219
Look at my health bar.

666
01:01:52,219 --> 01:01:53,179
It's so small.

667
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:56,139
That's ridiculously small.

668
01:01:56,139 --> 01:01:57,019
That's a joke.

669
01:01:57,019 --> 01:02:00,380
It's like I died 15 times in a row in Dark Souls.

670
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:15,570
Easy.

671
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,039
It's a baby health bar.

672
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,079
It is tiny.

673
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,269
That's so small.

674
01:02:22,269 --> 01:02:24,110
That's just stupidly small.

675
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:27,469
Anything in here?

676
01:02:27,469 --> 01:02:34,369
No.

677
01:02:34,369 --> 01:02:36,449
Quite a small health bar you have here.

678
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:37,409
Yeah, it is.

679
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:39,780
It can definitely be increased, though.

680
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,659
Don't worry.

681
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:50,460
If I remember, melee was actually pretty fun in these games, wasn't it?

682
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,619
Don't you have to string together combos?

683
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,079
Yes, you do.

684
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,519
Be sure to explore the world around you.

685
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:07,199
Following the glowing trail is extremely useful,

686
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:09,440
but there's so much to find off the beaten path.

687
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,119
We're exploring other corners of this cavern.

688
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:14,539
Is there going to be something for me?

689
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:18,050
Where's the bones?

690
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,739
Brendan's Diary.

691
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:23,599
It appears to be a page from an explorer's diary,

692
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,079
recording the details of an expedition into this cave.

693
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,250
My hand is shaking from exhaustion, but I must remain vigilant.

694
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,889
I almost nodded off last night as we camped around the fire.

695
01:03:31,889 --> 01:03:34,530
I still manage to keep an eye on Eric and Drake.

696
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,250
I have seen the greedy glimmer in their eyes.

697
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,329
They mean to make the treasure theirs.

698
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:43,840
Oh, maybe it's time to make use of the poison.

699
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,639
Oh, shit.

700
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:46,750
Not Aaron.

701
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,469
Eric.

702
01:03:47,469 --> 01:03:54,130
I just hit my head on that.

703
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:59,809
Brendan.

704
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:00,050
No.

705
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:01,570
Everybody hates that.

706
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,920
Eric's letter.

707
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,789
Soon we'll be rich.

708
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,250
Whatever.

709
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:18,639
There's not very many people that like the Aaron.

710
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:25,280
Wait, can I go up?

711
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,360
Can I get up there?

712
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:39,619
Nope.

713
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:41,619
How am I supposed to use magic if I don't have magic?

714
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:52,590
Do I get blessed at some point here in the minute?

715
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:55,869
I hate Attack on Titan so much.

716
01:04:58,179 --> 01:05:07,739
I'm sorry to hear that.

717
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:13,809
I don't know.

718
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:17,949
Range weapon.

719
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:19,469
I like the ranged.

720
01:05:19,469 --> 01:05:21,869
I really like the ranged, though, guys.

721
01:05:22,429 --> 01:05:24,030
You just ignored that guy?

722
01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:25,969
No, I would.

723
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:28,690
Okay, I've seen Attack on Titan.

724
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:37,550
I got through the first like five episodes and I was just like,

725
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,699
it was just like, I just too much for me.

726
01:05:42,699 --> 01:05:44,300
I was just like, I can't do this.

727
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:56,510
Liar.

728
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,380
Outstanding fight.

729
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:10,699
Thanks.

730
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:13,340
You watched it till 3 a.m.

731
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,340
You don't know anything about what I've done.

732
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:24,530
Please watch anything but Attack on Titan.

733
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:34,380
What is that?

734
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,699
What is that?

735
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:36,179
What's that from?

736
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:36,820
That's from something.

737
01:06:38,989 --> 01:06:39,389
What is that?

738
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:49,869
What is that?

739
01:06:49,869 --> 01:06:55,099
Is he serious?

740
01:06:55,099 --> 01:06:55,659
No, I like it.

741
01:06:55,659 --> 01:06:57,019
I feel like I've heard that somewhere.

742
01:06:57,019 --> 01:06:59,630
That like it's not.

743
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:00,030
No, no, no.

744
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:00,909
Not the song.

745
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:04,750
I know like the I'm talking about like the zoo, zoo, zoos.

746
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:16,179
It's from Jimmy Neutron guy.

747
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:17,380
Okay, listen, listen, listen, listen.

748
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,800
I got to clear this up.

749
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:25,119
I know that that's like the intro to the first season.

750
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,840
I'm talking about not the tune I was doing.

751
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,199
I'm talking about the zoos.

752
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:31,760
Like that's from something weird.

753
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:33,760
And I can't put my finger on it.

754
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:40,699
What is what is what is it?

755
01:07:40,699 --> 01:07:42,780
Choon.

756
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:43,659
It's Jimmy Neutron.

757
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,320
The French song from the 80s.

758
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:54,559
What?

759
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:06,190
Oh, 150 gold pieces.

760
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:10,050
I think it's a random noise that you just thought of.

761
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,980
Yeah, maybe.

762
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,779
The hero of Oakvale.

763
01:08:22,989 --> 01:08:24,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

764
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:34,000
No, it's real.

765
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,289
Oh, a mood ring.

766
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:41,250
All right, I have a ring.

767
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,369
I can get married.

768
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:47,619
It's from Augie and the Cockroaches.

769
01:08:49,579 --> 01:08:51,739
You just made that show up.

770
01:08:51,739 --> 01:08:52,699
That you made that.

771
01:08:52,699 --> 01:08:53,500
You made that up.

772
01:08:53,500 --> 01:09:00,180
That's not a real thing.

773
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:15,659
I've never heard of that show.

774
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:24,159
Hmm.

775
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,060
No man alive today remembers the night the guild burned.

776
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,979
And now it lies forgotten.

777
01:09:36,699 --> 01:09:38,460
But the heroes are not all gone.

778
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,220
You are here.

779
01:09:40,939 --> 01:09:43,659
And that same heroic blood flows through you.

780
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,020
It is.

781
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:45,659
It's real.

782
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:50,779
You're for the mightiest heroes who ever live.

783
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:53,739
At a young age, he suffered a devastating loss.

784
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:56,060
From which he never is alert alert alert.

785
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:56,619
Hold on.

786
01:09:56,619 --> 01:09:59,340
But when the world tried to crush him, he fought back.

787
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:04,060
He grew strong, strong enough to reshape the world as he saw fit.

788
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,920
You must do the same.

789
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,319
What is it?

790
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:07,439
Y'all are weird as fuck.

791
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:10,510
The guild has reacted to you.

792
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,470
Step into the light.

793
01:10:12,189 --> 01:10:12,909
Learn the true power of you.

794
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,750
Y'all are weird as fuck.

795
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:21,789
I need to...

796
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:22,510
All right, where is it?

797
01:10:31,729 --> 01:10:32,770
There's no more links allowed.

798
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,729
But Maude's gonna have to do it.

799
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:37,100
Into strength, skill.

800
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,699
Strength improves combat.

801
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:44,699
With skill allows you to shoot faster and with greater accuracy.

802
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,060
Will gives you control over the forces of magic.

803
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,430
I'll give you the cockroach's intro.

804
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:52,909
Okay, hold on.

805
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,310
It reacts to the will of...

806
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,310
Yeah, yeah, I got strength, agility, or...

807
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,390
You have not been able to use will yet.

808
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:03,069
But the simple act of reaching this place has given you will experience.

809
01:11:03,789 --> 01:11:07,069
You need to learn a will ability to activate the color's gate.

810
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:08,510
All right, is this it?

811
01:11:29,979 --> 01:11:31,100
Where's the zzzz?

812
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:31,659
I don't hear it.

813
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:47,260
That's not what I was...

814
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,020
That's not what I was doing.

815
01:11:57,539 --> 01:11:58,979
How would you even know that?

816
01:11:59,539 --> 01:12:00,100
I don't even know...

817
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,689
How would you even remember this?

818
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:04,529
There's no way you could even remember that shit.

819
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:08,449
Fuck, it is that, but that's not it.

820
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:14,479
That's so funny.

821
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:18,079
You should buy a will ability so that you can activate that color's gate.

822
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,960
Sorry, I'm sorry.

823
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,460
Hold on.

824
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:28,520
Okay.

825
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,920
No, I don't want to throw the ball to the dog.

826
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,199
No, don't...

827
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,340
Will.

828
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:44,899
Shock.

829
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,880
Inferno.

830
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,760
Time control.

831
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,460
Blades.

832
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,159
Oh, hold on.

833
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:52,960
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

834
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,560
Okay, area damage, target damage.

835
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:03,210
Inferno.

836
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:05,729
Inferno.

837
01:13:05,729 --> 01:13:09,569
Calls forth magical flames to scorch and burn your foes.

838
01:13:09,569 --> 01:13:10,529
That's from Frasier.

839
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,140
No, that's not from Frasier.

840
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,649
In the Frasier intro, he doesn't go...

841
01:13:21,649 --> 01:13:22,149
It's...

842
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:26,689
He actually talks.

843
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:30,260
It's like a song.

844
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:30,760
He's like...

845
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,630
He doesn't say, like, zzzz.

846
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:49,729
I like this one.

847
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:55,590
Oh, fuck.

848
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:56,550
Okay, I gotta stop.

849
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:59,399
This one's cool.

850
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:02,630
I like that.

851
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:03,430
Okay, vortex.

852
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:08,260
Vortex creates a powerful windstorm that will pummel your enemies.

853
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:09,699
Ooh, alright.

854
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:10,500
This one's good too.

855
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:14,279
Vortex.

856
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:14,779
Chaos.

857
01:14:15,699 --> 01:14:18,979
Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.

858
01:14:18,979 --> 01:14:22,420
They may flee, attack their fellows, or even fall in love with you.

859
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:22,920
Chaos.

860
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:30,800
Force push sends a blast of energy towards your enemies,

861
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,399
hurling them into nearby objects.

862
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:32,899
Mm.

863
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:35,060
It is very effective in confined spaces.

864
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,100
Raise the dead.

865
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,899
Raise dead causes the bones of the recently deceased to rise and fight for you.

866
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,560
Okay, that's cool.

867
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:46,439
I think I want chaos.

868
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:51,340
Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.

869
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:54,859
They may flee, attack their fellows, or even fall in love with you.

870
01:14:55,819 --> 01:14:56,619
No, do lightning.

871
01:14:56,619 --> 01:14:57,979
No, I'm doing chaos.

872
01:14:59,020 --> 01:14:59,739
What?

873
01:14:59,739 --> 01:15:01,699
Oh, I don't have enough.

874
01:15:01,699 --> 01:15:07,609
I can only do shock or inferno, and we're doing shock.

875
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,279
Shock stuns your enemies.

876
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:14,380
Okay, shock.

877
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:22,810
Abilities.

878
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,180
Strength, okay.

879
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,180
Brutal styles, physique, toughness.

880
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:30,470
Locking?

881
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:34,229
Brutal styles unlock special moves for use in close combat.

882
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:38,380
You still have a shit in your pants.

883
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:44,869
Yes, and I had unprotected sex with a big dump in my underwear.

884
01:15:44,869 --> 01:15:47,590
That's when you want to get gross?

885
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:48,470
Go ahead.

886
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:53,050
Physique is just HP, right?

887
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,649
The stronger your physique,

888
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:57,289
the more damage you will cause with close combat weapons.

889
01:15:57,289 --> 01:15:58,010
No, it's toughness.

890
01:15:58,729 --> 01:16:00,899
I don't have enough to do anything.

891
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:03,140
...is able to withstand more damage before...

892
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:05,140
Brutal styles unlock special moves...

893
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,119
I can do this one, brutal styles.

894
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:08,520
Lock.

895
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,159
You can now hold down X to block enemy's melee attacks.

896
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:11,800
All right, let's go.

897
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:19,300
All right, so now I have my skill.

898
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,619
Can you feel the power coursing through you?

899
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:22,100
I can.

900
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,300
It is only the beginning.

901
01:16:24,979 --> 01:16:28,659
Use your abilities to hit the split switch and power up the gate.

902
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,180
Click the switch.

903
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:32,340
Once activated, it will allow you to travel back to Brower Lake.

904
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,460
Whoa.

905
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:42,729
Come on, this is Chester.

906
01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:49,909
Go to www.fable2.com to access the golden items.

907
01:16:49,909 --> 01:16:51,189
What is this, a fucking ad?

908
01:16:51,989 --> 01:16:57,819
Now you are ready to begin your journey.

909
01:16:58,539 --> 01:16:59,500
Use the color space.

910
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,000
Oh!

911
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,020
Power up!

912
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,619
Oh, voice crack.

913
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:05,899
Too much power in my hands.

914
01:17:05,899 --> 01:17:07,899
Not enough power going into my vocal cords.

915
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:09,989
That's understandable.

916
01:17:09,989 --> 01:17:27,369
Damn, that was embarrassing, dude.

917
01:17:27,369 --> 01:17:28,010
No, it's all right.

918
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,609
Did you see how much lightning I shot out of my hand?

919
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:37,180
Use your newfound abilities to defeat them.

920
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:37,579
All right.

921
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:48,729
I've never done magic in Fable, but wow, this is pretty good.

922
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:50,520
Wow.

923
01:17:57,449 --> 01:17:58,170
That's pretty good.

924
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:05,909
Those two orbs hold the knowledge and experience of the creatures that you kill.

925
01:18:05,909 --> 01:18:06,229
Cool.

926
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:07,189
All right, I did it.

927
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,800
Seven dollars income?

928
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,319
Oh, somebody's renting the house.

929
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:13,529
That's not very much money.

930
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:19,130
Can I die if I jump off this?

931
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,340
Unlimited power!

932
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:29,140
Is it mana?

933
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,180
I guess there's no mana.

934
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:37,800
Pretending?

935
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:45,779
Wait, what?

936
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:46,340
Oh, shit.

937
01:18:46,899 --> 01:18:52,359
Wait, what?

938
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:53,000
Reload?

939
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,180
How come everyone said I was...

940
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,060
Wait, because I didn't...

941
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,140
I thought somebody said I could...

942
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:00,779
Right trigger?

943
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:06,460
No, I think these are just glitched out from old right trigger.

944
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:07,659
Yeah, no, I can't pick these up.

945
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:12,039
Yeah, this is just...

946
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,380
Yeah, this is not...

947
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,180
I can't pick this.

948
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,300
This is like a glitch from the lightning.

949
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:25,859
Yeah, what are you guys talking about?

950
01:19:32,619 --> 01:19:33,979
Watch Frasier on stream.

951
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:38,949
I didn't...

952
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:40,310
I never got into Frasier.

953
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,949
I didn't get it.

954
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,579
I just couldn't.

955
01:19:42,579 --> 01:19:43,300
I was just like...

956
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,979
I couldn't follow anything going on.

957
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:51,100
I think I was just too young.

958
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,020
I was too young to care about Frasier.

959
01:19:57,189 --> 01:19:59,270
The only thing that's in my brain from Frasier

960
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,630
is...

961
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:01,829
I don't know why, but like...

962
01:20:02,939 --> 01:20:06,779
Him doing like Kramer-esque entrances into rooms

963
01:20:06,779 --> 01:20:08,380
and like erratic movements and stuff

964
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,739
is like all I can see in my head.

965
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,619
I don't know why that's in my brain.

966
01:20:13,619 --> 01:20:14,819
He's like opening a door going like,

967
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,340
What happened here?

968
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:21,420
I don't know why I'm making him and Kramer the same person.

969
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:26,100
Like in my brain right now,

970
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,739
I'm watching him open the door to Jerry's apartment

971
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:30,100
and like be Kramer.

972
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,220
I don't know why.

973
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:38,649
Can I eat those?

974
01:20:38,649 --> 01:20:45,449
This is a silver key chest.

975
01:20:45,449 --> 01:20:47,210
The number of keys needed to open it shown on the chest.

976
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,010
Oh, I can open it.

977
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:48,810
I only needed one.

978
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:52,140
Dog tricks.

979
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:52,939
The bunny hop.

980
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:56,710
Dog trainer and circus owner Rufina Musket.

981
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:58,310
Oh, shit.

982
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:01,770
Teach the dog a trick.

983
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:04,949
All right, come here, you.

984
01:21:04,949 --> 01:21:07,909
Come here.

985
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:08,869
No, I want to...

986
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:11,960
Come here, I got to train you.

987
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:12,760
Come here.

988
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,649
No, come here.

989
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:16,659
All right, come here.

990
01:21:16,659 --> 01:21:17,460
Watch this.

991
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:27,739
The dog can now bunny hop to see him do this.

992
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:30,939
Dance, laugh, whistle, play the lute or strike a heroic pose.

993
01:21:30,939 --> 01:21:33,180
Okay.

994
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:42,760
Do you dance?

995
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:48,039
Is it?

996
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,949
All right, let's look for more treasure chests.

997
01:21:54,949 --> 01:21:59,529
What's in here?

998
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:04,680
Keep it out for dive spots.

999
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:08,729
Oh, shit.

1000
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:09,449
25 gold.

1001
01:22:09,449 --> 01:22:09,689
Nice.

1002
01:22:10,409 --> 01:22:17,180
All right, I can marry somebody now.

1003
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:24,090
He's trying his best.

1004
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:24,970
Yeah, he's doing fine.

1005
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:28,659
He's doing great.

1006
01:22:33,109 --> 01:22:34,310
I was going to shock that guy.

1007
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:38,649
Activity.

1008
01:22:40,069 --> 01:22:45,590
I'm afraid as long as the bandit tag is alive, the road stays closed.

1009
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:47,109
We got to get rid of...

1010
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:50,949
You could always take care of tag yourself.

1011
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,590
I mean, when germ is streaming right now.

1012
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:56,170
Okay.

1013
01:22:56,729 --> 01:22:58,409
The road to barstone is closed.

1014
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,970
It would seem that has been capturing traders on their way to the bow lake camp.

1015
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:06,090
He is a danger to all must be dealt with.

1016
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:08,250
He's giving money.

1017
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:12,010
You should be able to defeat him and his gang and continue your quest.

1018
01:23:12,729 --> 01:23:15,369
No doubt they are at his camp near bow lake.

1019
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:16,739
All right, let's go get him.

1020
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,159
Yo, when's this guy streaming?

1021
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:27,689
Put it out.

1022
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:29,909
How mad is he?

1023
01:23:29,909 --> 01:23:31,239
I just got here.

1024
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:32,039
I'm not mad at all.

1025
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:32,760
I'm perfectly fine.

1026
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:39,510
Why do you guess I'm not...

1027
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:40,390
I am not angry.

1028
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:40,869
I'm happy.

1029
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:42,550
I'm playing Fable 2.

1030
01:23:43,109 --> 01:23:44,550
Super nostalgic right now.

1031
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:46,069
Having a lot of nostalgia fun.

1032
01:23:46,069 --> 01:23:48,149
By the way, don't miss next Sunday's stream.

1033
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:50,819
Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.

1034
01:23:50,819 --> 01:24:02,329
It may be a trap.

1035
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:03,850
Sunday stream is going to be interesting.

1036
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,970
I have an obligation.

1037
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:09,689
Somebody has been blowing my phone up for a long time.

1038
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:13,770
Finally going to get this person the opportunity they wanted a long time ago.

1039
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:16,489
They're very excited.

1040
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:17,289
Of course they are.

1041
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:20,920
Just I'm not going to be on the stream.

1042
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,239
I'm just going to let them do whatever they want.

1043
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,760
And hopefully it's good.

1044
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:32,619
I don't know.

1045
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:33,180
Bandits.

1046
01:24:33,979 --> 01:24:37,289
Oh, that was easy.

1047
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:48,489
Anybody else?

1048
01:24:48,489 --> 01:24:55,500
What do you mean I've been hurt by an enemy?

1049
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:04,119
Oh my god, magic is awesome.

1050
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,100
You can now afford force push.

1051
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:16,630
It's just Jedi Academy again.

1052
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,659
Yeah, it is Jedi Academy again, isn't it?

1053
01:25:27,859 --> 01:25:29,060
Oh shit, that was cool.

1054
01:25:41,109 --> 01:25:42,630
You got to keep like a combo going, right?

1055
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:49,640
They're just waiting for you to kill them.

1056
01:25:50,869 --> 01:25:51,369
Whoa!

1057
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,000
Oh shit, one, two, three.

1058
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:10,880
Watch out!

1059
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:17,779
Wait, did I kill him?

1060
01:26:17,779 --> 01:26:18,819
Why did I kill him?

1061
01:26:19,619 --> 01:26:30,420
Oh dog, are you all right?

1062
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:38,810
Just shooting in random directions.

1063
01:26:46,789 --> 01:26:51,140
Okay, I got him.

1064
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,100
You're now famous.

1065
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,800
Dog, you hurt the dog.

1066
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,840
I got him, I got him, I got him.

1067
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:06,010
Come here.

1068
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:10,039
The new hero.

1069
01:27:10,039 --> 01:27:10,600
All right, come here.

1070
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:12,350
Come here.

1071
01:27:18,699 --> 01:27:21,800
You good?

1072
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,680
There we go.

1073
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,239
All right.

1074
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:24,039
Good boy.

1075
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:32,439
You all right?

1076
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:33,319
Yes, you're okay.

1077
01:27:33,319 --> 01:27:38,220
Oh, that keeps it in his chest.

1078
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:39,180
Don't worry, stand back.

1079
01:27:39,739 --> 01:27:42,810
That's not hurting him, is it?

1080
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:53,159
What do you got in here?

1081
01:27:54,949 --> 01:27:58,390
Cage key, rancid beef jerky, and a money bag.

1082
01:27:59,189 --> 01:27:59,590
Nice.

1083
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:00,390
All right, anything else?

1084
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,159
Dog tricks.

1085
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:12,840
I don't know, whatever.

1086
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,859
Hey, mate!

1087
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:16,859
Don't even think about letting them out.

1088
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:20,149
Those slaves belong to me.

1089
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:22,310
I paid for them.

1090
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,109
Are you?

1091
01:28:23,109 --> 01:28:23,609
Okay.

1092
01:28:23,609 --> 01:28:25,350
Look, I don't want any trouble.

1093
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,430
Give the key to me and I'll make it worth your while.

1094
01:28:30,779 --> 01:28:32,380
No, don't listen to him.

1095
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,260
Never.

1096
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,060
Shut up.

1097
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:37,770
You wouldn't do that to us.

1098
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:38,729
What'd you sparrow?

1099
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:41,579
I said shut it.

1100
01:28:41,579 --> 01:28:43,020
I'm not gonna tell you again.

1101
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:46,880
Uh.

1102
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,000
Sir, what do you say, stranger?

1103
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,279
Do you like giving a living?

1104
01:28:52,279 --> 01:28:53,239
Am I this bad?

1105
01:28:53,239 --> 01:28:54,119
I can't hit him.

1106
01:28:54,119 --> 01:29:04,060
Kill this piece of garbage, no problem.

1107
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,590
You're right, I could, couldn't I?

1108
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:06,949
Now you've gone and earned it.

1109
01:29:06,949 --> 01:29:16,140
You gonna say sorry?

1110
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:19,850
Are you gonna say sorry or should I give you more juice?

1111
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:20,409
Say sorry.

1112
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:25,560
There is something you must see.

1113
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,609
Come on, guys, let's go.

1114
01:29:27,609 --> 01:29:36,949
Thank you so much.

1115
01:29:36,949 --> 01:29:43,420
Free to wander the paths and byways of the land.

1116
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,739
No, master, but the wind itself.

1117
01:29:45,739 --> 01:29:52,199
Time stretched out before is like, like, that's the word I want, Reg.

1118
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:53,989
I don't know.

1119
01:29:54,710 --> 01:29:55,829
Turn safety on.

1120
01:29:55,829 --> 01:29:56,789
Turn safety on.

1121
01:29:56,789 --> 01:29:57,829
I'm going now.

1122
01:29:57,829 --> 01:29:58,630
Thanks again.

1123
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:00,069
Should I turn safety back on or leave it off?

1124
01:30:00,069 --> 01:30:01,109
Oh, yes, thanks.

1125
01:30:01,109 --> 01:30:10,390
All right, I'm turning safety on.

1126
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:16,470
All right, let me, hold on, let me look at what else we got.

1127
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,890
They might have some fucking goodies.

1128
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:27,619
It'll be funnier if it's off.

1129
01:30:27,619 --> 01:30:28,260
Not yet.

1130
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:31,220
Let me at least get to, like, level two magician and then maybe.

1131
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:34,659
All right, let's go back.

1132
01:30:34,659 --> 01:30:37,239
I can level up.

1133
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:40,460
Can I level up right here?

1134
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:55,029
I was at nothing in any of those.

1135
01:30:55,029 --> 01:30:59,020
House, house, house, house, house.

1136
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,220
I'm looking at the house.

1137
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:07,130
What's that?

1138
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:08,489
Buy and move in.

1139
01:31:08,489 --> 01:31:13,210
This thing is 5,500 bucks near the door.

1140
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:20,060
Is there money?

1141
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:23,800
I can sleep in this guy's bed?

1142
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:32,020
Oh, I thought that was a pot.

1143
01:31:32,659 --> 01:31:34,439
There's one gold in here.

1144
01:31:34,439 --> 01:31:34,840
Thanks, guys.

1145
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,279
I'm glad I went back for it.

1146
01:31:36,279 --> 01:31:43,319
All right, where do I want to go?

1147
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:47,689
What does, what's over here?

1148
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:57,449
Is there anything ever in barrels?

1149
01:31:57,449 --> 01:31:58,810
Is there no reason for me to do this?

1150
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:06,630
All the crates are always empty.

1151
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:09,029
Okay, thank you.

1152
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:10,390
Exactly what I was looking for.

1153
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:21,189
Look at that pop in.

1154
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:45,460
Do you get a horse in this game eventually?

1155
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:48,699
This looks like, okay, you know what this looks like?

1156
01:32:48,699 --> 01:32:53,880
This looks like the full motion, pre-rendered,

1157
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,920
like, advertising material for the game.

1158
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,119
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1159
01:32:58,119 --> 01:33:08,279
This always seems really interlaced.

1160
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:13,989
It's like a pre-rendered video of something,

1161
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:15,590
but they have the settings all wrong.

1162
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:25,670
But it's not even like, it's like a trailer.

1163
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:34,170
Okay, it's me.

1164
01:33:38,810 --> 01:33:40,170
Well, it's my first one.

1165
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:41,770
I'm just starting out.

1166
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,569
How's it go?

1167
01:33:42,569 --> 01:33:43,609
Listen to this.

1168
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:48,619
A hero went to Bower Lake and gave the thug a bellyache.

1169
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:52,920
That's all I've got so far,

1170
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,079
but maybe if I walk around Bowerstone with you,

1171
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:56,199
I'll get some inspiration.

1172
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:01,750
Really is quite foul.

1173
01:34:04,779 --> 01:34:05,739
That wasn't even a song.

1174
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,819
You can't go to class with your book report,

1175
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:11,739
with the title of the book report.

1176
01:34:11,739 --> 01:34:13,500
Come on, you're going to stop me

1177
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
before I get in the hero of Bowerstone

1178
01:34:15,979 --> 01:34:18,779
and give me like, the fucking title of your song.

1179
01:34:18,779 --> 01:34:22,359
You know how much value my time is right now?

1180
01:34:22,359 --> 01:34:30,039
Trophy.

1181
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:33,210
What was that?

1182
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:39,180
Oh, thank you.

1183
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:39,680
Hello.

1184
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,619
Have you seen how big my muscles are?

1185
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,060
How about a dance?

1186
01:35:05,529 --> 01:35:06,649
Oh, plus 24.

1187
01:35:06,649 --> 01:35:07,369
Holy shit.

1188
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:10,460
Am I a chicken chaser?

1189
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,020
No.

1190
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:14,069
What else have we got?

1191
01:35:15,829 --> 01:35:18,949
Okay, a victory arm pump.

1192
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:21,369
Very good.

1193
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:34,109
Okay.

1194
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:36,899
Thank you.

1195
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:39,060
Hey, how about you and I get a coffee sometime?

1196
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:43,050
I was open to see you today.

1197
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:00,560
What?

1198
01:36:08,439 --> 01:36:10,279
This is so exciting.

1199
01:36:10,279 --> 01:36:11,079
Oh shit, where am I?

1200
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:11,720
Where am I?

1201
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,520
I have a ring, don't I?

1202
01:36:13,319 --> 01:36:14,890
I have a ring.

1203
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:28,600
I'm already married.

1204
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,100
No, I'm not.

1205
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,050
More info.

1206
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:42,170
Rachel, the housewife.

1207
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,529
Middle class straight flirt.

1208
01:36:44,329 --> 01:36:47,270
Likes Fairfax demon door.

1209
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:49,899
Homemade apple pies and dancing.

1210
01:36:49,899 --> 01:36:51,659
Doesn't like the bloodlust roar.

1211
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:58,600
What did I just do?

1212
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:01,899
Did I just give her a ring?

1213
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:09,800
Did I just give it to her?

1214
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,939
I just gave her the ring.

1215
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:17,939
I gave her a book.

1216
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:19,300
The Hero of Oakvale.

1217
01:37:21,899 --> 01:37:22,399
Harry.

1218
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:24,300
Rancid beef jerky.

1219
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,000
All right.

1220
01:37:38,539 --> 01:37:40,199
All right, come with me.

1221
01:37:51,319 --> 01:37:52,039
Follow me.

1222
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:55,100
He doesn't like the ring?

1223
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:59,539
It's a shit ring?

1224
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:09,270
How much money do I have?

1225
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,180
You gave her the ring pop ring.

1226
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,739
This guy's chasing me.

1227
01:38:16,739 --> 01:38:17,460
Get away from me.

1228
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:25,449
That's a cool bridge.

1229
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:30,489
Just want to make everyone really clear around me.

1230
01:38:30,489 --> 01:38:31,050
Safety's off.

1231
01:38:33,609 --> 01:38:34,810
I just want everyone to know that here.

1232
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:43,770
Anything I can help you with?

1233
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:46,430
Cheers.

1234
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:48,409

Drinks trader.

1237
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:52,199
What can I buy?

1238
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:55,500
Uh, gotta be a box wine.

1239
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,220
It's my favorite.

1240
01:38:57,989 --> 01:38:58,869
Okay, how much is this?

1241
01:38:59,829 --> 01:39:00,390
Eight bucks?

1242
01:39:00,949 --> 01:39:02,170
I'll take one.

1243
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:04,010
I hope you enjoy it.

1244
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:05,529

01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,239
Oh shit, I'll take it.

1247
01:39:11,239 --> 01:39:13,689
Regret that purchase.

1248
01:39:13,689 --> 01:39:16,460
What the hell is this for?

1249
01:39:20,359 --> 01:39:20,840
Atness?

1250
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:25,300

1251
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:25,859

Deluded tomato juice.

1253
01:39:29,779 --> 01:39:30,180
Gross.

1254
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,819
All right, what else do I got?

1255
01:39:40,649 --> 01:39:42,180
What about this guy?

1256
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,340
Remember, it is a crime to hit innocents.

1257
01:39:53,979 --> 01:39:54,539
Is it now?

1258
01:39:54,539 --> 01:39:54,859

All right, chicken fried button?

1263
01:40:04,489 --> 01:40:05,369
Oh yeah, let's go.

1264
01:40:05,369 --> 01:40:06,409
I hope you enjoy it.

1265
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:10,319
Thank you for your custom.

1266
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,159
Come back anytime.

1267
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:17,760
Fish trader.

1268
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:25,500
Treasure.

1269
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,939
I know it's a crime to hit somebody.

1270
01:40:26,939 --> 01:40:29,579
Why is it so scared that I'm going to do something?

1271
01:40:29,579 --> 01:40:34,090
And I say, Jeremy, remember, if you hit somebody, it's a crime.

1272
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:34,569
Don't do it.

1273
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,439
Get out of the way.

1274
01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:43,000
Hey, safety's off.

1275
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:43,640
Get out of the way.

1276
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:45,979
That's right.

1277
01:40:45,979 --> 01:40:48,649
Oh shit, it's right there.

1278
01:40:48,649 --> 01:40:56,329
300 gold.

1279
01:40:56,329 --> 01:40:57,289
Holy shit.

1280
01:40:57,289 --> 01:40:58,010
Nice job, Doug.

1281
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:06,960
Art until they pass out.

1282
01:41:10,279 --> 01:41:13,159
What the hell are you talking about?

1283
01:41:13,159 --> 01:41:13,880
A gold dump.

1284
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,359
Town square.

1285
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:24,319
I have bad news.

1286
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,840
I'm afraid I will be delayed for a while.

1287
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:33,260
In the meantime, you should buy some new equipment and prepare for the challenges ahead.

1288
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:34,300
But you'll need money.

1289
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,819
If you need money, there are jobs to be found.

1290
01:41:37,819 --> 01:41:39,579
I believe the blacksmith has an opening.

1291
01:41:42,859 --> 01:41:43,579
Town crier.

1292
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,180
What are you looking for?

1293
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:47,520
Sparrow.

1294
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,319
Chicken chaser.

1295
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:48,720
There it is.

1296
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:51,600
500 bucks?

1297
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:54,720
Get the fuck out of here.

1298
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:59,760
This is a thousand bucks?

1299
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,600
No, I want to be dumpling.

1300
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,479
How is this not free?

1301
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:09,550
It is free.

1302
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:14,060
What's this?

1303
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:14,539
What is this one?

1304
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:21,369
That's me.

1305
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:30,649
That's me.

1306
01:42:30,649 --> 01:42:31,130
Dumpling.

1307
01:42:33,449 --> 01:42:40,239
Oh, this guy loves that.

1308
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:00,279
They all lean down to get a better view of that.

1309
01:43:00,279 --> 01:43:01,479
That was disgusting.

1310
01:43:02,119 --> 01:43:08,800
Who's this?

1311
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,640
I need some...

1312
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,520
I need this to work.

1313
01:43:12,329 --> 01:43:12,729
Jeweler.

1314
01:43:14,109 --> 01:43:14,670
All right.

1315
01:43:14,670 --> 01:43:16,029
How about mood ring is...

1316
01:43:16,829 --> 01:43:18,859
How much is a jet?

1317
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:19,420
Oh, fuck.

1318
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:20,060
Sell that.

1319
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:20,859
I don't need this thing.

1320
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:22,859
Keep the mood ring.

1321
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:26,140
Porcelain doll.

1322
01:43:28,119 --> 01:43:28,760
Poshness.

1323
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:32,539
Wedding bells.

1324
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:33,020
What's this?

1325
01:43:33,819 --> 01:43:36,760
A book of tips to make anyone fall in love with you.

1326
01:43:39,529 --> 01:43:40,890

Beggar's ring.

1329
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,720
Keep flowers.

1330
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:51,439
Perfume.

1331
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:51,920
Chocolate.

1332
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,819
I'll buy some chocolate.

1333
01:43:56,619 --> 01:43:56,939
All right.

1334
01:43:56,939 --> 01:44:00,909
How about civil ring?

1335
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:07,479
Okay, cool.

1336
01:44:11,069 --> 01:44:18,000
Total gold earned.

1337
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,039
Required for promotion.

1338
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:19,520
Take jobs.

1339
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,000

01:44:21,369 --> 01:44:24,409
Tap A when the target is over the sweet spot to score a good hammer.

1341
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:26,170
Make a perfect sword.

1342
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:29,520
Okay.

1343
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:31,279
I'm gonna go somewhere romantic?

1344
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:43,000
Where could we go?

1345
01:44:44,439 --> 01:44:44,840
All right.

1346
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:45,560
I gotta do...

1347
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:46,600
I have to work.

1348
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:47,000
Goodbye.

1349
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:54,090
Hold on.

1350
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:55,130
My leg is really itchy.

1351
01:45:00,199 --> 01:45:01,239
Old multiplier?

1352
01:45:01,239 --> 01:45:02,199
How do I get that to go higher?

1353
01:45:04,779 --> 01:45:05,420
Or...

1354
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:05,899
That's it?

1355
01:45:18,029 --> 01:45:18,510
What?

1356
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:21,130
Just don't fuck up.

1357
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:26,430
Nice bit of forging.

1358
01:45:31,229 --> 01:45:34,590
It's closing time for all the shop.

1359
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:40,590
I'm gonna just have a close sign.

1360
01:45:48,649 --> 01:45:49,449
Gold till promotion.

1361
01:45:49,449 --> 01:45:49,689
Okay.

1362
01:45:50,409 --> 01:45:56,380
Okay.

1363
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:57,579
This is like 30 FPS.

1364
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:00,380
So the thing is actually moving really strangely.

1365
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:05,579
You've been promoted.

1366
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:08,250
Oh, let me do one more.

1367
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:14,800
24.

1368
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:15,199
Let's go.

1369
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:19,000
Okay.

1370
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:19,800
Take the next level.

1371
01:46:20,439 --> 01:46:24,300
You are now level two blacksmith.

1372
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:24,619
Nice.

1373
01:46:27,279 --> 01:46:27,600
Nice.

1374
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:27,920
All right.

1375
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,479
Let's do it again.

1376
01:46:36,279 --> 01:46:37,880
Bards of the past.

1377
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,880
Back when there were heroes everywhere.

1378
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:43,479
Human eye can only see 24 FPS anyways.

1379
01:46:43,479 --> 01:46:43,800
I know.

1380
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:49,079
Out of my way.

1381
01:46:49,079 --> 01:46:49,479
I can't see.

1382
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:53,439
Get out of the way.

1383
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:58,729
This person just like breathing down my neck.

1384
01:46:58,729 --> 01:46:59,289
Get out of here.

1385
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,119
Look at how shitty that is.

1386
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:22,039
It's going so weird.

1387
01:47:22,039 --> 01:47:23,399
He was talking to shit.

1388
01:47:25,319 --> 01:47:27,960
You're all revolting disgusting animals.

1389
01:47:29,319 --> 01:47:30,840
We should close your web chat.

1390
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,800
It's revolting.

1391
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:38,960
All right.

1392
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:39,680
Teresa's coming.

1393
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:47,819
All right.

1394
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,479
24 HP.

1395
01:47:53,479 --> 01:47:54,600
That's pathetic.

1396
01:47:54,600 --> 01:48:04,619
The 24 FPS thing rich behind the light exposure.

1397
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:05,979
Computer monitors a bunch of lights.

1398
01:48:08,170 --> 01:48:08,409
Yeah.

1399
01:48:08,409 --> 01:48:09,369
I mean, all right.

1400
01:48:09,369 --> 01:48:14,649
If it's not 60 FPS, then I did get just get it out of we'll get it away from me.

1401
01:48:24,939 --> 01:48:26,060
It's a bunch of atoms.

1402
01:48:26,619 --> 01:48:34,859
Play VR at 24 FPS.

1403
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:37,210
Cool.

1404
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:37,369
Yeah.

1405
01:48:37,369 --> 01:48:40,649
That would be that would suck shaping up nicely.

1406
01:48:40,649 --> 01:48:41,930
That would be really awful.

1407
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:43,840
I got promoted.

1408
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:44,159
All right.

1409
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:46,000
Take the next job.

1410
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:47,760
Let's keep the multiplier going.

1411
01:48:52,479 --> 01:48:53,760
Level three blacksmith.

1412
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,159
Let's go.

1413
01:49:04,359 --> 01:49:05,479
Seven thousand bucks.

1414
01:49:06,199 --> 01:49:10,270
That's how you make a blame.

1415
01:49:10,270 --> 01:49:12,079
Am I about to just make like 10 grand?

1416
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:13,600
I'm going to buy a bunch of houses and stuff.

1417
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:19,039
He's addicted.

1418
01:49:19,039 --> 01:49:19,199
Yeah.

1419
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:20,159
I'm addicted to money.

1420
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:22,300
I have 1500.

1421
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:25,819
I want to have like 10 grand and I'm going to go buy like a really cool wand.

1422
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:41,840
How many there's five levels.

1423
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:46,279
This is going to take like 30 minutes.

1424
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,449
No, it's no one.

1425
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,640
I'm just going to do up to level.

1426
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,840
I'm just going to get to the next level and that's it.

1427
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,560
I'm going to go meet Teresa after I buy some new clothes.

1428
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:59,340
I'm going to go buy a bunch of food.

1429
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:00,140
I want to get fat too.

1430
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:01,260
Like, of course, I'm going to do that.

1431
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:02,779
If you're going to give me the opportunity to do that, you know,

1432
01:50:02,779 --> 01:50:04,539
I'm not going to be like the fat guy in the game.

1433
01:50:04,539 --> 01:50:05,340
Are you serious?

1434
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:06,600
Why would I not do that?

1435
01:50:11,789 --> 01:50:17,159
I'm going to be like a big fat magician.

1436
01:50:23,479 --> 01:50:26,359
Oh, by the way, I got weighed recently at the doctor.

1437
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,880
I'm 161 pounds.

1438
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:31,840
I'm gaining and I'm gaining.

1439
01:50:32,569 --> 01:50:33,529
I've got to cut it down.

1440
01:50:33,529 --> 01:50:39,180
I've got to like, I got to change the diet a little bit, I think.

1441
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:40,060
We don't care.

1442
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:40,699
I do.

1443
01:50:40,699 --> 01:50:41,819
So I'm going to tell you about it.

1444
01:50:47,739 --> 01:50:48,699
I almost blew it.

1445
01:50:48,699 --> 01:50:52,350
Why are you telling us this?

1446
01:50:52,909 --> 01:50:54,079
I don't know.

1447
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,239
Hey, but yeah, you screwed me up.

1448
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:56,640
What do you mean?

1449
01:50:57,279 --> 01:50:58,399
Why wouldn't I tell you this?

1450
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,420
What is this like stream?

1451
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:04,220
I'm just, I'm going to tell you stuff that happens in my life.

1452
01:51:04,779 --> 01:51:15,960
You choked.

1453
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:19,960
Yeah, because I'm talking about how fat I am and somebody said I don't even care.

1454
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,960
And I'm like, well, I care how fat I'm getting.

1455
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:27,159
No, I'm all screwed up now.

1456
01:51:27,159 --> 01:51:29,319
I'll get it.

1457
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:38,989
I just checked your BMI.

1458
01:51:38,989 --> 01:51:41,069
Yeah, my BMI is probably like 70 or something.

1459
01:51:55,229 --> 01:51:56,029
70.

1460
01:51:56,029 --> 01:51:58,590
Yeah, 70 would be, I'd be made out of like butter.

1461
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:07,020
I'm not even sure that butter has a 70% BMI.

1462
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:21,199
BMI is body mass index.

1463
01:52:27,319 --> 01:52:30,920
Yeah, it's a nice fancy fucking thing that guys with the big fancy degrees

1464
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,760
tell you to stop eating Doritos every day.

1465
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:33,880
Okay, sure.

1466
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,920
Oh, that, look, that was, that was fucked up.

1467
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:51,199
That was fucked up.

1468
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:52,000
You see that?

1469
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,420
The FPS, it like skipped.

1470
01:52:55,420 --> 01:53:11,760
Remember, if you're 10 pounds overweight, you win.

1471
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:11,920
What?

1472
01:53:13,529 --> 01:53:15,529
I believe I'm like five pounds overweight.

1473
01:53:16,649 --> 01:53:17,529
Which I can fix that.

1474
01:53:17,529 --> 01:53:17,930
That's easy.

1475
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:19,789
I'll just, it'll be fine.

1476
01:53:31,229 --> 01:53:34,510
Running for my prostate exam was a, wait, what?

1477
01:53:35,229 --> 01:53:36,170
Just go in.

1478
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:51,840
All right, I'm almost, I'm, I'm, I'm, my multipliers are getting pretty good.

1479
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:52,319
This will be fine.

1480
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:54,399
Don't screw it up.

1481
01:53:55,039 --> 01:53:58,039
144.

1482
01:53:58,039 --> 01:53:58,439
Let's go.

1483
01:53:59,319 --> 01:53:59,880
Five grand.

1484
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:10,989
God damn it.

1485
01:54:10,989 --> 01:54:11,310
All right.

1486
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:11,470
Wow.

1487
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:12,670
That was a complete fake.

1488
01:54:12,670 --> 01:54:13,789
That was a total.

1489
01:54:13,789 --> 01:54:14,670
I should not have gotten that.

1490
01:54:14,670 --> 01:54:15,949
It was not even in the green, not even close.

1491
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:31,289
I need to do 30 more.

1492
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:35,600
No, I don't mean 30.

1493
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:36,079
Fuck.

1494
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:36,479
All right.

1495
01:54:36,479 --> 01:54:37,680
That guy fucked with me.

1496
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:38,159
Whatever.

1497
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:38,960
I'm done.

1498
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:47,659
All right.

1499
01:54:47,659 --> 01:54:48,619
This Teresa.

1500
01:54:48,619 --> 01:54:49,340
All right, Teresa.

1501
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:49,659
I'm here.

1502
01:55:00,619 --> 01:55:01,979
All the places you've been.

1503
01:55:01,979 --> 01:55:03,100
The people you've known.

1504
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:03,420
Okay.

1505
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:03,979
Up and down.

1506
01:55:03,979 --> 01:55:04,539
Everything you've done.

1507
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:06,060
Make comments.

1508
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:07,260
How many moments?

1509
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:08,300
How many memories?

1510
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,600
Fag and his men.

1511
01:55:11,319 --> 01:55:12,359
They had just as many.

1512
01:55:13,159 --> 01:55:14,640
And now they have none.

1513
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:15,920
Because of you.

1514
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:19,520
Do you feel the weight of responsibility yet?

1515
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,020
No.

1516
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:24,159
You will get used to the burden as all heroes must.

1517
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:28,989
The world is better off without Fag.

1518
01:55:28,989 --> 01:55:30,909
And certainly Bower Lake is in your debt.

1519
01:55:31,869 --> 01:55:34,600
But to really see the impact of your actions.

1520
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,680
You need look no further than Bower's town.

1521
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,399
Consequences?

1522
01:55:37,399 --> 01:55:38,039
Uh oh.

1523
01:55:38,039 --> 01:55:39,960
It has changed much since you lived here.

1524
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,840
Particularly old town where you spent your childhood.

1525
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:45,800
I almost just pressed triangle and just shot that lady with a crossbow.

1526
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,680
Even the simplest choice can have far reaching consequences.

1527
01:55:55,819 --> 01:55:57,100
That's going to happen eventually.

1528
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:57,579
I know it is.

1529
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:01,479
Oh, it's my old can.

1530
01:56:01,479 --> 01:56:02,039
Whatever this is.

1531
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:03,640
That is where Lucian is now.

1532
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,760
Hattered spire.

1533
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,319
Where?

1534
01:56:06,319 --> 01:56:11,199
I thought it was in the moon.

1535
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:19,279
The spire was intended as a conduit granting the kingdom's ruler a power so great

1536
01:56:19,279 --> 01:56:21,600
he could bend reality to his will.

1537
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:24,460
The day it was completed.

1538
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:26,779
And the first wish made.

1539
01:56:27,819 --> 01:56:29,420
A light bloomed inside.

1540
01:56:29,979 --> 01:56:32,670
Though its nature could not have been darker.

1541
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:36,270
Being shattered.

1542
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:42,880
Centuries of civilization were wiped out in moments.

1543
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,960
Its people erased from existence.

1544
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:47,520
Some say that this was the first wish.

1545
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:50,000
An end to a hollow and corrupt world.

1546
01:56:50,079 --> 01:56:52,000
And for a purer one to take its place.

1547
01:56:57,659 --> 01:57:02,520
And now the spire rises once again.

1548
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:05,880
Lucian found documents which foretold the coming of one

1549
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,560
who would stop him using the spire.

1550
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:11,319
That is why your sister died.

1551
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:13,960
And that is why you will face him.

1552
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,680
The cards have shown me this.

1553
01:57:18,029 --> 01:57:22,859
Here, take a look.

1554
01:57:22,859 --> 01:57:23,659
Eight cards.

1555
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:27,340
Each of the three heroes you see in the cards

1556
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:30,140
is a step on the hidden path to Lucian's downfall.

1557
01:57:31,369 --> 01:57:35,529
And the life force of heroes will itself is the key to the spire.

1558
01:57:35,529 --> 01:57:36,489
Why is he running?

1559
01:57:36,489 --> 01:57:37,609
Wait, what?

1560
01:57:37,609 --> 01:57:40,649
Lucian's agents scour the land even as we speak.

1561
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:45,279
You must find the three heroes before Lucian does.

1562
01:57:45,279 --> 01:57:46,800
Because you are the fourth.

1563
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,960
The one who will bring his downfall.

1564
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:52,409
I have seen a vision of a holy ritual in Oakfield.

1565
01:57:53,979 --> 01:57:57,979
Salvation, though bittersweet, is delivered by one of incredible strength.

1566
01:57:58,699 --> 01:58:03,399
Speak to the abbot at the temple of light

1567
01:58:03,399 --> 01:58:05,159
and see what you can learn of this pilgrim.

1568
01:58:07,310 --> 01:58:09,069
The road to Oakfield will be dangerous.

1569
01:58:09,069 --> 01:58:10,670
You saw the poop in your pants?

1570
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:11,550
Good luck.

1571
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:13,229
How would you have seen the poop in my pants?

1572
01:58:16,699 --> 01:58:17,579
All right, I have money.

1573
01:58:17,579 --> 01:58:18,699
I want to buy some stuff.

1574
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:22,989
What's that?

1575
01:58:22,989 --> 01:58:28,109
Oh, shit, look at this.

1576
01:58:28,109 --> 01:58:30,029
By Richard the Stonecutter.

1577
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:33,069
Final price, $5,500.

1578
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:38,539
I buy this?

1579
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:44,399
Kill the owner.

1580
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:49,399
Where is he?

1581
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:53,479
Kill the owner?

1582
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:11,279
Eliminate that guy.

1583
01:59:12,329 --> 01:59:13,930
All right, so if I tell somebody to follow me

1584
01:59:14,569 --> 01:59:16,090
and then I walk them into a bunch of bandits

1585
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:16,890
and they just get killed.

1586
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:19,020
I am not...

1587
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:21,500
I don't kill them so I don't get bad person points

1588
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:22,859
but I can just take the money that's on them

1589
01:59:22,859 --> 01:59:23,899
and then buy their empty house.

1590
01:59:24,859 --> 01:59:25,500
Is that accurate?

1591
01:59:31,659 --> 01:59:32,140
Pretty evil.

1592
01:59:44,859 --> 01:59:46,140
Sounds like a serial killer.

1593
01:59:48,729 --> 01:59:50,800
You're better off just being pure evil.

1594
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:53,600
No, but then I don't get the benefits of being good.

1595
01:59:56,010 --> 01:59:56,729
Which, by the way,

1596
01:59:57,369 --> 01:59:58,890
what are the benefits of being good?

1597
01:59:58,890 --> 02:00:00,890
I've never done it in any one of these video games.

1598
02:00:02,109 --> 02:00:03,789
I always accidentally just like

1599
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:06,510
start murdering people in the towns

1600
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:08,270
and I've never seen what a good playthrough is.

1601
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:12,909
Never.

1602
02:00:18,199 --> 02:00:19,479
You look less ugly.

1603
02:00:21,239 --> 02:00:21,800
Is that it?

1604
02:00:24,989 --> 02:00:26,109
Just less ugly?

1605
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:30,829
People will constantly want to marry you.

1606
02:00:32,909 --> 02:00:40,779
I guess that is a little annoying.

1607
02:00:40,779 --> 02:00:42,140
There we go, I've got a good multiplier here.

1608
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:51,359
New sword, what do you think?

1609
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:57,229
$250, let's go.

1610
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:08,000
Thanks.

1611
02:01:09,289 --> 02:01:10,329
Ooh, that was risky.

1612
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:17,390
Evil is funner.

1613
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:18,430
I missed, but it's okay.

1614
02:01:21,399 --> 02:01:23,239
I mean, evil is always gonna be funner

1615
02:01:23,239 --> 02:01:25,239
because I can just walk into a store

1616
02:01:25,239 --> 02:01:26,279
and just take everything.

1617
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,199
I don't even need money.

1618
02:01:28,199 --> 02:01:29,720
I can just kill the guy behind the register

1619
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:32,039
and take everything in the fucking store.

1620
02:01:32,039 --> 02:01:42,779
Of course it's funner and easier.

1621
02:01:42,779 --> 02:01:45,020
There's good, evil, and then pure and corrupt.

1622
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:49,560
Should I be good and corrupt?

1623
02:01:50,439 --> 02:01:51,720
Or evil and pure?

1624
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:52,760
What does that even mean?

1625
02:01:52,760 --> 02:02:04,720
Evil and pure?

1626
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:06,319
Pure evil.

1627
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:06,960
Oh, I see.

1628
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:11,420
Oh, that was a mistake.

1629
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:15,760
It means evil and vegetarian.

1630
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:18,920
I fucked it up.

1631
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:20,119
Yeah, I got too greedy.

1632
02:02:20,119 --> 02:02:20,760
It's all right.

1633
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:24,960
Should I just be an evil vegan?

1634
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,239
No, I won't be able to get fat.

1635
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:38,409
Should I be a fat vegan?

1636
02:02:38,409 --> 02:02:46,829
How is a lawful vegan?

1637
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,619
I don't know why that's making me laugh.

1638
02:02:56,619 --> 02:02:57,340
I don't know why.

1639
02:02:57,340 --> 02:02:59,180
Because you could be fat anything.

1640
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:03,390
It's just based on calories and fat content.

1641
02:03:07,710 --> 02:03:09,470
You know how to use a hammer.

1642
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:23,229
Yeah, I'm going to be a good, fat, pure, evil, vegetarian.

1643
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:37,930
All right, almost there.

1644
02:03:43,229 --> 02:03:45,470
Good fatty acids only.

1645
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:49,659
That's how you make a blade.

1646
02:03:49,659 --> 02:03:51,180
Damn it, I was reading chat.

1647
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:52,060
Shit, I was so...

1648
02:03:52,859 --> 02:03:55,159
I'm almost done.

1649
02:03:56,439 --> 02:03:57,319
I'm almost done, please.

1650
02:04:06,439 --> 02:04:09,960
Yeah, I'm going to be chaotic, monounsaturated fat.

1651
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:14,699
Holy shit, that was awful.

1652
02:04:14,699 --> 02:04:15,819
What was I doing?

1653
02:04:15,819 --> 02:04:22,699
Nice bit of forging.

1654
02:04:22,699 --> 02:04:30,970
All right, almost done.

1655
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,359
I promise I'm not going to do this.

1656
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:34,079
I need money though.

1657
02:04:40,649 --> 02:04:41,770
Jeremy, this is too much.

1658
02:04:43,819 --> 02:04:45,659
I'm just playing a blacksmithing mini-game.

1659
02:04:47,529 --> 02:04:49,210
I'm not electrocuting your seat.

1660
02:04:51,899 --> 02:05:01,840
Oh shit, I didn't even test if the audio was synced.

1661
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:02,880
I'm almost done.

1662
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:03,770
Everybody relax.

1663
02:05:05,609 --> 02:05:16,939
I'm doing this now because I wanted to do this later.

1664
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:20,460
You know, you realize if I do this now,

1665
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:23,100
then it's a super simple way for me to make a bunch of money later.

1666
02:05:37,979 --> 02:05:39,340
Every time you hit the hammer wrong,

1667
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:41,739
I receive one-fifth of a lethal injection.

1668
02:05:42,699 --> 02:05:46,239
I really hate to tell you,

1669
02:05:46,239 --> 02:05:50,399
but one-fifth of a lethal injection is a lethal injection.

1670
02:05:50,399 --> 02:05:50,880
You're gone.

1671
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:53,369
There's no such thing as that, I'm sorry.

1672
02:06:09,289 --> 02:06:10,170
That dude's dead.

1673
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:10,649
No, he's not.

1674
02:06:10,649 --> 02:06:11,289
I haven't missed.

1675
02:06:17,079 --> 02:06:19,390
All right, there we go.

1676
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:19,789
We're good.

1677
02:06:20,510 --> 02:06:21,949
Now we're going to go till I lose.

1678
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:31,630
What's going on?

1679
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:41,470
Just go until you lose because this is a ton of money.

1680
02:06:42,029 --> 02:06:47,479
Next level, not yet, not yet.

1681
02:06:47,479 --> 02:06:49,390
All right, now we're done.

1682
02:06:49,390 --> 02:06:49,710
We're done.

1683
02:06:49,710 --> 02:06:50,750
I got 9,500 bucks.

1684
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:51,630
Time to get some more equipment.

1685
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:53,149
I want a better outfit.

1686
02:06:53,949 --> 02:06:54,989
I'm going to eat a shitload of food.

1687
02:06:55,550 --> 02:07:09,050
I got a good bunch of stuff.

1688
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:10,640
Yeah, let's eat.

1689
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:15,340
All right, let's have some fucking mutton.

1690
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:15,739
Ugly.

1691
02:07:17,899 --> 02:07:19,659
Okay, what if they don't see me gain weight?

1692
02:07:19,659 --> 02:07:22,090
What if I just show up later and I'm fat?

1693
02:07:22,090 --> 02:07:33,390
They won't see like me turning fat.

1694
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:41,520
Tomato juice, chicken fried mutton.

1695
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,119
No, I can't give you any of this.

1696
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:48,109
Wait, that kid just says school gives me too much homework.

1697
02:07:48,109 --> 02:07:49,229
Dude, you do have school.

1698
02:07:49,229 --> 02:07:57,449
Does getting fat make you slower?

1699
02:07:58,010 --> 02:08:07,739
Okay, now we go drink a bunch of beer.

1700
02:08:07,739 --> 02:08:13,979
Is there a way I can see how fat I am?

1701
02:08:20,329 --> 02:08:28,859
Look, look in a mirror.

1702
02:08:28,859 --> 02:08:37,600
No, I'm talking about like, holy shit, what's going on?

1703
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:44,539
I just got, I want more like bread.

1704
02:08:44,539 --> 02:08:45,020
Here we go.

1705
02:08:45,949 --> 02:08:46,350
Pies.

1706
02:08:46,989 --> 02:08:47,930
This will do it.

1707
02:08:48,729 --> 02:08:50,250
Oh yeah, you better believe it.

1708
02:08:50,250 --> 02:08:51,689
All right, give me some apple pies.

1709
02:08:53,680 --> 02:09:02,380
Beef pie, country beef pie, crab apple pie, kidney and friends pie, crumbly pie.

1710
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:02,859
Let's go.

1711
02:09:03,979 --> 02:09:16,000
Okay, crumbly and friends pie.

1712
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:20,409
I'm leveling up.

1713
02:09:22,090 --> 02:09:22,649
Oh, thanks.

1714
02:09:23,369 --> 02:09:27,659
This is the shame corner.

1715
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:34,880
I'm leveling up by eating.

1716
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:35,520
This is great.

1717
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:36,720
Okay, crab apple pie.

1718
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:39,199
Well, get out of here.

1719
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:40,159
You're not supposed to be watching me.

1720
02:09:40,159 --> 02:09:41,119
Stop watching me eat.

1721
02:09:41,119 --> 02:09:42,399
Get the fuck away from me.

1722
02:09:42,399 --> 02:09:45,119
Let me eat in peace.

1723
02:09:45,119 --> 02:09:56,029
What?

1724
02:09:56,029 --> 02:10:07,119
Is this as big as I can get?

1725
02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:08,079
How big can I get?

1726
02:10:08,079 --> 02:10:09,760
I've gotten a little bigger, haven't I?

1727
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:21,039
Apple pie pocket.

1728
02:10:21,039 --> 02:10:23,399
Your love for food and your aversion to exercise

1729
02:10:23,399 --> 02:10:25,560
have earned you the right to be called salad dodger.

1730
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:38,939
Salad dodger?

1731
02:10:38,939 --> 02:10:40,380
Okay, country blueberry pie.

1732
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:43,079
What was that?

1733
02:10:43,079 --> 02:10:44,039
Why did I just freak out?

1734
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:46,239
I almost tried flirting with you.

1735
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:49,180
All right, let's flirt.

1736
02:10:58,859 --> 02:10:59,420
She's happy.

1737
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:02,619
Oh my god, I have gained a lot of weight, haven't I?

1738
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:14,640
I need more food.

1739
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,239
Is there like a way I can tell how big I am?

1740
02:11:48,539 --> 02:11:49,340
What about Zaffer?

1741
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:50,699
I'm getting close to just hitting...

1742
02:11:50,699 --> 02:11:52,140
I'm just getting close to zapping this lady.

1743
02:11:54,649 --> 02:11:58,489
What do you sell?

1744
02:11:58,489 --> 02:11:59,050
Steel.

1745
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:02,350
Wait, I can be a good person and steal.

1746
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:04,590
Don't call yourself the dump.

1747
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:05,069
Dump?

1748
02:12:05,069 --> 02:12:06,430
I'm not serving you.

1749
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:07,869
Not nicely anyway.

1750
02:12:07,869 --> 02:12:08,109
What?

1751
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:10,479
7% markup?

1752
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:19,979
No, look, it's the dump.

1753
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:24,159
Okay, how do I just take things?

1754
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:27,079
I can be a good person and steal furniture.

1755
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:38,279
Wait, is this guy rated?

1756
02:12:38,279 --> 02:12:38,920
Who's rated?

1757
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,800
Oh, it's San rated.

1758
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:43,439
Oh shit.

1759
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:45,850
What's going on, everybody?

1760
02:12:51,850 --> 02:12:52,489
Thanks, San.

1761
02:12:52,489 --> 02:12:52,810
Welcome.

1762
02:12:54,479 --> 02:12:55,439
Welcome to the stream.

1763
02:12:56,079 --> 02:12:59,850
That's a lot of people.

1764
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:02,649
Thanks a lot, dude.

1765
02:13:04,239 --> 02:13:04,880
Raid song?

1766
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:06,239
I don't have a raid song.

1767
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:06,800
I don't.

1768
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:07,359
I can't.

1769
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:09,199
There's too many people to embarrass myself in front of.

1770
02:13:14,109 --> 02:13:17,079
If you're just joining, I'm playing Fable 2.

1771
02:13:18,090 --> 02:13:23,289
I'm in the middle of trying to make my guy very large and strong and heavy.

1772
02:13:23,289 --> 02:13:28,970
I'm just feeding him.

1773
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:31,210
He's a magic user and now we're going to go do the quest.

1774
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:33,920
Thanks for the huge raid, dude.

1775
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:34,960
Welcome, everybody.

1776
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,720
I'm a pretty normal guy.

1777
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:38,079
I'm pretty like...

1778
02:13:38,079 --> 02:13:39,760
You know, I'm kind of, you know, I'm normal.

1779
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:40,479
I don't...

1780
02:13:40,479 --> 02:13:41,039
Whatever.

1781
02:13:41,039 --> 02:13:41,840
All right, thanks for coming.

1782
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:43,930
I don't know what to say.

1783
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:44,810
That's so many people.

1784
02:13:44,810 --> 02:13:46,170
Can I steal, please?

1785
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:50,329
Okay, how do I turn this person around?

1786
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:53,479
Oh shit, here we go.

1787
02:13:53,479 --> 02:13:56,399
All right, I want to buy clothes.

1788
02:13:56,399 --> 02:13:56,960
Here we go.

1789
02:13:56,960 --> 02:14:01,000
Can I buy a wig?

1790
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,090
All right, I'm going to buy the Mickey Mouse gloves.

1791
02:14:08,279 --> 02:14:12,380
And I want to...

1792
02:14:13,020 --> 02:14:13,819
An eye patch?

1793
02:14:13,819 --> 02:14:14,380
No.

1794
02:14:14,380 --> 02:14:14,939
How about...

1795
02:14:14,939 --> 02:14:16,140
Okay, how about like the...

1796
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:17,500
Yeah, I'm going to do like a wrestler mask.

1797
02:14:22,909 --> 02:14:23,630
And these things.

1798
02:14:24,350 --> 02:14:25,390
Yeah, definitely these.

1799
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:29,500
Oh, the wizard hat's awesome, too.

1800
02:14:31,689 --> 02:14:32,569
Can I get a wizard hat?

1801
02:14:32,569 --> 02:14:33,449
Yes, I need the wizard hat.

1802
02:14:33,449 --> 02:14:34,329
Of course I do.

1803
02:14:34,329 --> 02:14:50,399
Okay, I want headgear.

1804
02:14:50,399 --> 02:14:52,000
Can I not wear the mask and the...

1805
02:14:52,640 --> 02:14:53,119
Yeah, I can wear...

1806
02:14:53,119 --> 02:14:58,189
Can I wear them both?

1807
02:14:58,189 --> 02:14:58,909
Really?

1808
02:14:58,909 --> 02:15:06,890
Okay, I like those.

1809
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:07,210
Mask.

1810
02:15:07,210 --> 02:15:09,680
Here we go.

1811
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:16,600
Oh, I have to have some...

1812
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:17,479
I have to wear something up here.

1813
02:15:17,479 --> 02:15:18,600
How about like the big gown?

1814
02:15:22,119 --> 02:15:24,119
Wow, I'm attractive.

1815
02:15:24,119 --> 02:15:24,840
What?

1816
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:25,479
Afraid of me?

1817
02:15:35,239 --> 02:15:36,760
Yeah, the Archmage robes.

1818
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:37,479
That's perfect.

1819
02:15:39,609 --> 02:15:40,109
Okay.

1820
02:15:42,810 --> 02:15:43,310
Perfect.

1821
02:15:43,949 --> 02:15:46,140
What do you think of me now?

1822
02:15:47,659 --> 02:15:48,159
Thank you.

1823
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:53,300
Robe and wizard hat.

1824
02:15:54,739 --> 02:15:55,300
Not yet.

1825
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:56,100
I like how this looks.

1826
02:15:59,939 --> 02:16:01,060
You were about to steal from a villager.

1827
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:01,699
This is a crime.

1828
02:16:01,699 --> 02:16:03,619
The eye icon tells you if anyone can see you.

1829
02:16:21,069 --> 02:16:21,869
The perfect crime.

1830
02:16:21,869 --> 02:16:24,289
The dog distracts them.

1831
02:16:24,289 --> 02:16:28,539
It was four gold?

1832
02:16:28,539 --> 02:16:29,180
28 grand.

1833
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:37,100
All right, I'm gonna do a mission.

1834
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:37,899
Bad boy time.

1835
02:16:37,899 --> 02:16:40,700
Yeah, we're big good picture, bad small picture.

1836
02:16:40,700 --> 02:16:42,579
That means I can steal from registers.

1837
02:16:42,579 --> 02:16:47,790
That means I can punch people in the face if I don't like them at all.

1838
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:51,549
But I'm gonna be a good person in the grand scheme of things.

1839
02:16:52,110 --> 02:16:57,219
Stealing $40 from the register, but I'm gonna like save the town.

1840
02:17:06,399 --> 02:17:09,520
See?

1841
02:17:20,659 --> 02:17:22,579
I'm gonna shock somebody accidentally.

1842
02:17:22,579 --> 02:17:23,700
Does the game save itself?

1843
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:28,750
Chaotic Hungary.

1844
02:17:41,969 --> 02:17:42,610
Oh, shit.

1845
02:17:42,610 --> 02:17:43,010
Thank you.

1846
02:17:51,969 --> 02:17:52,370
Thank you.

1847
02:17:52,370 --> 02:17:52,850
Have a good day.

1848
02:17:54,450 --> 02:17:54,850
I will.

1849
02:17:55,809 --> 02:17:56,530
I appreciate that.

1850
02:17:56,530 --> 02:17:57,329
Thanks for the discount.

1851
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:01,760
Digspot.

1852
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:05,090
Where's our digspot?

1853
02:18:05,090 --> 02:18:05,489
Over here?

1854
02:18:06,129 --> 02:18:08,049
Where is it?

1855
02:18:08,049 --> 02:18:11,409
Where is it?

1856
02:18:11,409 --> 02:18:15,819
Where's the digspot?

1857
02:18:15,819 --> 02:18:20,819
Is this illegal?

1858
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:29,409
Um, what the hell is going on?

1859
02:18:36,299 --> 02:18:37,420
Is it because safety's on?

1860
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:37,979
Oh, okay.

1861
02:18:41,069 --> 02:18:46,000
Oh, by the way, I want to make it clear again.

1862
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,280
Uh, don't miss the stream next weekend on Sunday.

1863
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,719
Percival peanuts?

1864
02:18:50,719 --> 02:18:53,379
Okay.

1865
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:55,899
All right, what do you want?

1866
02:19:00,989 --> 02:19:02,909
Oh, they they know that I'm the swordsman.

1867
02:19:02,909 --> 02:19:03,409
Okay.

1868
02:19:08,659 --> 02:19:09,860
Am I streaming Saturday too?

1869
02:19:09,860 --> 02:19:10,360
I am not.

1870
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:16,479
I am streaming tomorrow, but next Saturday, no.

1871
02:19:16,479 --> 02:19:17,360
Next Sunday only.

1872
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:21,120
All right, let's go find this guy.

1873
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:28,190
I need to level up.

1874
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,069
How do I level up?

1875
02:19:29,069 --> 02:19:31,299
Do I have to go to like the guild thing?

1876
02:19:40,879 --> 02:19:41,440
Surprising.

1877
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:42,959
You gained 200 pounds.

1878
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:43,840
Just drink it right now.

1879
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:48,500
Nice job.

1880
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:50,989
You found me ground wine.

1881
02:19:50,989 --> 02:19:53,709
Can I open this?

1882
02:19:53,709 --> 02:19:56,000
Is it five?

1883
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:10,899
Oh, damn it.

1884
02:20:10,899 --> 02:20:12,579
Wait, you're streaming next Sunday?

1885
02:20:12,579 --> 02:20:17,229
Well, this channel is going to be live, but it's not...

1886
02:20:17,229 --> 02:20:18,510
It's not going to be me streaming.

1887
02:20:19,149 --> 02:20:20,610
I have to...

1888
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:22,780
It's a whole lore deal.

1889
02:20:22,780 --> 02:20:25,389
All right, what do I want here?

1890
02:20:25,389 --> 02:20:28,500
Chaos?

1891
02:20:32,659 --> 02:20:33,780
Or just shock 2?

1892
02:20:37,379 --> 02:20:40,719
I think I want chaos.

1893
02:20:41,780 --> 02:20:44,819
Chaos confuses your foes, making them unpredictable.

1894
02:20:45,899 --> 02:20:46,940
You've learned the chaos spell.

1895
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:49,420
Summon a mask of madness to scramble the minds of your enemies,

1896
02:20:49,420 --> 02:20:50,700
and you never know what might happen.

1897
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,260
Cast your spell wide to catch more enemies.

1898
02:20:53,260 --> 02:20:53,899
Okay.

1899
02:20:53,899 --> 02:20:55,579
How do I select which one I want to use?

1900
02:20:55,579 --> 02:21:01,649
I can do time as well?

1901
02:21:01,649 --> 02:21:04,610
Time control allows you to slow the world around you,

1902
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:06,370
or to move with incredible speed.

1903
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:07,409
Oh, I can buy this too.

1904
02:21:07,409 --> 02:21:08,610
No, I'll save it.

1905
02:21:08,610 --> 02:21:10,379
I don't need it.

1906
02:21:10,379 --> 02:21:13,659
Extra style accuracy speed.

1907
02:21:14,219 --> 02:21:18,659
The greater your speed, the faster you will be able to unleash it.

1908
02:21:18,659 --> 02:21:19,540
Oh, I can learn roll.

1909
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:20,020
I want this.

1910
02:21:20,979 --> 02:21:22,540
Tap A while moving.

1911
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:23,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1912
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:24,459
That's a huge deal.

1913
02:21:24,459 --> 02:21:24,940
I need it.

1914
02:21:28,479 --> 02:21:30,079
And physique?

1915
02:21:30,799 --> 02:21:33,420
Upness?

1916
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:33,979
There we go.

1917
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:35,489
More health.

1918
02:21:36,049 --> 02:21:44,579
When there is a sail on, the thing will flash.

1919
02:21:44,579 --> 02:21:45,219
Press it now.

1920
02:21:48,219 --> 02:21:48,780
Sails.

1921
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:51,250
Blacksmith sail?

1922
02:21:51,969 --> 02:21:54,209
Oh shit.

1923
02:21:54,209 --> 02:21:56,110
Oh my god.

1924
02:21:57,329 --> 02:22:03,010
All right, let's go.

1925
02:22:03,010 --> 02:22:04,530
How do I select the spell?

1926
02:22:06,209 --> 02:22:09,389
Is there a way I can select the spell?

1927
02:22:10,030 --> 02:22:12,899
Left bumper?

1928
02:22:19,219 --> 02:22:19,459
B?

1929
02:22:21,139 --> 02:22:21,700
Watch out, dog.

1930
02:22:23,569 --> 02:22:23,969
Hold B.

1931
02:22:24,850 --> 02:22:39,659
Push down on the D-pad well with a weapon drawn

1932
02:22:39,659 --> 02:22:41,979
while facing a potential victim to turn off safety mode.

1933
02:22:54,209 --> 02:22:55,090
Okay, so this is a bad guy.

1934
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,399
Oh, all right.

1935
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:07,069
Is it bad?

1936
02:23:12,909 --> 02:23:15,149
Oh, that's nice, that is.

1937
02:23:16,479 --> 02:23:18,559
I'm sure they'd want you to have it.

1938
02:23:20,079 --> 02:23:27,309
Is that evil?

1939
02:23:27,309 --> 02:23:28,899
That guy was a bad guy.

1940
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:35,090
That was a bad guy.

1941
02:23:35,809 --> 02:23:40,180
He probably ran him off the road.

1942
02:23:40,180 --> 02:23:40,899
That was a lie.

1943
02:23:41,540 --> 02:23:45,469
Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1944
02:23:45,469 --> 02:23:47,229
Saint Peter can fucking judge that guy, okay?

1945
02:23:47,229 --> 02:23:48,750
See, you can go up and Saint Peter can judge him.

1946
02:23:48,750 --> 02:23:49,069
Not me.

1947
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:51,819
Ow.

1948
02:23:58,340 --> 02:23:58,819
Crossbow?

1949
02:23:58,819 --> 02:24:01,860
Who needs a fucking crossbow when I got unlimited power?

1950
02:24:18,799 --> 02:24:20,000
Oh shit, give me that stuff.

1951
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:27,680
Damn it.

1952
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:39,139
Give me it.

1953
02:24:40,659 --> 02:24:45,440
All right, let's do chaos.

1954
02:24:48,940 --> 02:24:50,379
Hey, who is it?

1955
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:55,569
Whatever, they can't even hit me.

1956
02:24:56,780 --> 02:24:57,979
One spell, Andy.

1957
02:24:57,979 --> 02:24:58,860
It's effective.

1958
02:24:58,860 --> 02:24:59,979
It's a really good spell.

1959
02:25:04,270 --> 02:25:05,309
Oh, I like that one.

1960
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:08,159
That one, I feel like I should be like,

1961
02:25:08,159 --> 02:25:13,969
Avada Kedavra.

1962
02:25:13,969 --> 02:25:15,010
What does he say?

1963
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:25,489
Avada Kedavra, okay.

1964
02:25:34,370 --> 02:25:35,889
Let's fight each other, who cares?

1965
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:44,989
Is he even doing anything?

1966
02:25:45,629 --> 02:25:49,149
The spell sucks.

1967
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:56,420
What am I even doing here?

1968
02:25:57,059 --> 02:26:01,100
Why would I do that when I could just do this?

1969
02:26:01,659 --> 02:26:12,579
Everybody fight.

1970
02:26:12,579 --> 02:26:14,059
What just happened?

1971
02:26:14,059 --> 02:26:14,299
What?

1972
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:19,360
Doctor Strange?

1973
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:29,280
All right, fight each other.

1974
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:30,639
What are they all standing around for?

1975
02:26:41,379 --> 02:26:43,299
Am I even fighting bad people here right now?

1976
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:56,399
No, no, no, no, I don't want to fall.

1977
02:26:56,399 --> 02:26:57,440
I want his stuff.

1978
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:59,500
Is he dead?

1979
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:00,700
Oh, fuck.

1980
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:03,459
Oh, God, no.

1981
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:13,219
That's what I want.

1982
02:27:13,219 --> 02:27:14,659
I want to confuse him then shoot him in the head.

1983
02:27:15,459 --> 02:27:19,739
All right, that ability is terrible.

1984
02:27:20,459 --> 02:27:30,659
I got to go to bed?

1985
02:27:30,659 --> 02:27:32,899
Well, have a great sleep, man.

1986
02:27:32,899 --> 02:27:34,020
Thanks for watching.

1987
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:36,139
Hopefully, we see you maybe tomorrow.

1988
02:27:36,139 --> 02:27:38,159
And we'll see you tomorrow.

1989
02:27:38,159 --> 02:27:42,059
If not, then I really hope we see you on next Sunday.

1990
02:27:50,590 --> 02:27:52,590
Oh, the dog's book of war.

1991
02:27:52,590 --> 02:27:58,579
The dog is now a two-star fighter.

1992
02:27:58,579 --> 02:27:59,139
Oh, nice.

1993
02:27:59,139 --> 02:27:59,379
Okay.

1994
02:28:11,170 --> 02:28:45,520
Okay, he reacted to it.

1995
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:51,860
I'm trying to go like right in his face.

1996
02:28:51,860 --> 02:29:04,059
How come he's not getting up?

1997
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:12,510
What is going on?

1998
02:29:35,870 --> 02:29:37,149
All right, that was the last brawl.

1999
02:29:37,149 --> 02:29:38,750
We're going to ignore this guy.

2000
02:29:38,750 --> 02:29:40,750
He shit in my face.

2001
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:42,909
He shit his pants in my face and that was it.

2002
02:29:42,909 --> 02:29:44,190
I'm not going to fucking stand for that.

2003
02:29:44,989 --> 02:29:46,370
Oh, my God.

2004
02:29:46,370 --> 02:29:47,969
They're kicking the shit out of me.

2005
02:29:47,969 --> 02:30:01,920
Oh, eat this.

2006
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:08,479
Okay.

2007
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:11,520
Oh, what do you got?

2008
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:12,079
Dig spot?

2009
02:30:12,079 --> 02:30:15,180
Let's go.

2010
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:16,059
And a treasure right here.

2011
02:30:16,059 --> 02:30:16,780
This game is fun.

2012
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:21,600
This game is really not that hard, but whatever we do is fun.

2013
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:28,350
Oh, money.

2014
02:30:28,350 --> 02:30:34,909
That was a real fart fecal funny moment.

2015
02:30:34,909 --> 02:30:43,069
Well, it's guaranteed comedy.

2016
02:30:43,069 --> 02:30:43,870
Hide snout.

2017
02:30:44,610 --> 02:30:47,010
Your dog can now hide his snout to see him do it.

2018
02:30:47,010 --> 02:30:47,889
Belcher fart.

2019
02:30:48,450 --> 02:30:49,889
Well, I have to do it.

2020
02:30:49,889 --> 02:30:59,680
It's so stupid.

2021
02:31:03,629 --> 02:31:04,670
Sus guy shits his pants.

2022
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:44,989
I can't shoot these people.

2023
02:31:44,989 --> 02:31:45,229
Why?

2024
02:31:51,149 --> 02:31:53,629
Are you afraid of heights?

2025
02:31:53,629 --> 02:32:01,579
It's scripted.

2026
02:32:01,579 --> 02:32:02,059
Yes, it is.

2027
02:32:06,129 --> 02:32:07,250
Oh, bandit cave.

2028
02:32:07,250 --> 02:32:07,729
Let's go.

2029
02:32:15,059 --> 02:32:16,579
My son Joey's in there.

2030
02:32:16,579 --> 02:32:18,659
I don't know why I just thought this was Diablo 3.

2031
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:22,579
I thought this guy was going to be following me around in the cave

2032
02:32:22,579 --> 02:32:25,379
and eventually show up in the camp with something.

2033
02:32:25,379 --> 02:32:26,340
Be like a merchant.

2034
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:28,500
I don't know why I thought that's exactly what was going to happen.

2035
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:28,739
All right.

2036
02:32:28,739 --> 02:32:29,139
What do you need?

2037
02:32:29,139 --> 02:32:29,620
What's going on?

2038
02:32:30,340 --> 02:32:32,180
I don't suppose you want to go in the cave.

2039
02:32:33,569 --> 02:32:35,010
Should we go in the cave?

2040
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:35,569
Please.

2041
02:32:35,569 --> 02:32:35,809
Okay.

2042
02:32:36,610 --> 02:32:39,819
I hear cats meowing.

2043
02:32:48,930 --> 02:32:55,950
I know I played this game,

2044
02:32:55,950 --> 02:32:57,709
but for some reason I have zero memories of it.

2045
02:32:58,510 --> 02:33:01,120
Yeah, me too.

2046
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:04,159
I think I went to the midnight release of this game.

2047
02:33:10,270 --> 02:33:12,139
I remember getting this super early.

2048
02:33:13,659 --> 02:33:20,719
Strength potion.

2049
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:20,959
All right.

2050
02:33:26,239 --> 02:33:27,280
Super forgettable.

2051
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:27,520
Oh.

2052
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:34,909
I mean, yeah.

2053
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:36,899
It was very...

2054
02:33:36,899 --> 02:33:37,940
Yeah, I don't remember any of this.

2055
02:33:40,219 --> 02:33:41,100
I remember the...

2056
02:33:42,139 --> 02:33:44,399
Oh, it's the sound of your own heartbeat.

2057
02:33:44,399 --> 02:33:44,799
That's it.

2058
02:33:45,440 --> 02:33:49,870
There's a sale going on or whatever.

2059
02:33:49,870 --> 02:33:56,270
I need some better items, though.

2060
02:33:56,270 --> 02:33:58,829
I can't just shock people all stream.

2061
02:33:59,469 --> 02:34:00,510
Oh, come here.

2062
02:34:00,510 --> 02:34:00,909
It's okay.

2063
02:34:00,909 --> 02:34:01,309
Come here.

2064
02:34:02,030 --> 02:34:04,180
What the fuck was that?

2065
02:34:04,739 --> 02:34:06,860
What the hell happened?

2066
02:34:06,860 --> 02:34:08,350
Oh, sorry.

2067
02:34:08,350 --> 02:34:10,110
I've never seen anything like this before.

2068
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:11,069
Does this guy possessed?

2069
02:34:11,709 --> 02:34:17,329
This guy's going to die.

2070
02:34:17,329 --> 02:34:20,479
Oh, you're back.

2071
02:34:20,479 --> 02:34:26,719
Uh-oh.

2072
02:34:27,180 --> 02:34:34,129
All right.

2073
02:34:34,129 --> 02:34:34,690
Stay behind me.

2074
02:34:44,530 --> 02:34:50,879
Are they going to die?

2075
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:55,299
Bum this guy.

2076
02:34:55,299 --> 02:34:55,940
I'm going holy shit.

2077
02:34:55,940 --> 02:34:57,780
This guy's really weak.

2078
02:34:57,780 --> 02:35:10,530
That was fucking awful.

2079
02:35:32,739 --> 02:35:33,059
I don't...

2080
02:35:33,059 --> 02:35:34,260
I'm the silent protagonist.

2081
02:35:36,579 --> 02:35:38,079
Get up here.

2082
02:35:38,079 --> 02:35:38,399
Let's go.

2083
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:43,360
Come on.

2084
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:44,159
I'm trying to save you.

2085
02:35:48,059 --> 02:35:51,409
Don't worry.

2086
02:35:52,370 --> 02:35:54,770
I put every single point in one move.

2087
02:35:55,489 --> 02:35:57,500
I barely know how to walk.

2088
02:35:58,139 --> 02:36:01,139
I don't know how to read.

2089
02:36:01,940 --> 02:36:03,700
I have no idea what a fucking pen does.

2090
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:07,549
But let me tell you, when I was a little kid,

2091
02:36:07,549 --> 02:36:10,030
all the way through my early adulthood into my 30s,

2092
02:36:10,030 --> 02:36:12,909
I put every fucking birthday worth of points into lightning bolt.

2093
02:36:12,909 --> 02:36:13,709
We're going to be fine.

2094
02:36:13,709 --> 02:36:15,549
You're just going to have to guide me around.

2095
02:36:15,549 --> 02:36:17,680
Where's this dig spot?

2096
02:36:19,809 --> 02:36:21,899
But where is it?

2097
02:36:21,899 --> 02:36:22,540
What are you talking about?

2098
02:36:23,180 --> 02:36:33,139
And then I hit him in the chest.

2099
02:36:33,139 --> 02:36:35,540
I'm like, hey, hey, don't bring me near water, though.

2100
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,819
Don't bring me near water, though.

2101
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:41,979
I love myself a useless.

2102
02:36:41,979 --> 02:36:55,409
What's that one doing?

2103
02:36:55,409 --> 02:36:56,530
What's wrong with that guy?

2104
02:36:57,409 --> 02:36:59,090
Why is he shimming around his stomach?

2105
02:37:11,969 --> 02:37:12,850
One move, Andy.

2106
02:37:12,850 --> 02:37:13,329
That's right.

2107
02:37:13,329 --> 02:37:14,129
That's me.

2108
02:37:14,129 --> 02:37:24,180
This is how you gain magics points, though.

2109
02:37:31,149 --> 02:37:35,020
Dude, I mean, on all your birthday skill points,

2110
02:37:35,020 --> 02:37:38,459
you didn't put any into like even walking or running?

2111
02:37:39,420 --> 02:37:40,219
Nope.

2112
02:37:40,219 --> 02:37:46,510
Or thinking or like strength?

2113
02:37:46,510 --> 02:37:47,309
Nope, none.

2114
02:37:47,389 --> 02:37:54,180
I've actually I've had to be fed at a baby seat my entire life.

2115
02:37:54,180 --> 02:37:55,540
I don't even know what I don't even like.

2116
02:37:55,540 --> 02:37:57,059
I couldn't even tell you what food is.

2117
02:37:57,059 --> 02:37:58,579
I'm just saying somebody just gives it to me.

2118
02:37:58,579 --> 02:38:19,180
OK, I could power the entire city of Las Vegas if you let me.

2119
02:38:19,180 --> 02:38:21,069
Hey, let's go.

2120
02:38:27,469 --> 02:38:28,190
Shit dog.

2121
02:38:28,190 --> 02:38:29,629
What the fuck was that?

2122
02:38:29,629 --> 02:38:44,780
All right.

2123
02:38:44,780 --> 02:38:45,500
I'll handle this one.

2124
02:38:46,940 --> 02:38:50,340
What the hell is that?

2125
02:38:50,899 --> 02:38:52,829
What the hell was that?

2126
02:38:54,530 --> 02:38:55,010
Oh, shit.

2127
02:38:55,010 --> 02:38:55,729
Is he alive?

2128
02:38:55,729 --> 02:38:56,209
Where is he?

2129
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,239
Oh, whoops.

2130
02:38:58,239 --> 02:39:07,420
My son into.

2131
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:21,280
He dead.

2132
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,040
You should get out of there.

2133
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:25,280
Head for the surface quickly.

2134
02:39:38,229 --> 02:39:38,870
Oh, shit.

2135
02:40:03,079 --> 02:40:04,280
They got sick of my shit.

2136
02:40:08,579 --> 02:40:08,979
Shit.

2137
02:40:08,979 --> 02:40:09,299
OK.

2138
02:40:10,020 --> 02:40:11,219
They can't do that to me, right?

2139
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:13,459
What am I doing?

2140
02:40:14,479 --> 02:40:15,040
Turn around.

2141
02:40:17,670 --> 02:40:18,870
What the fuck am I doing?

2142
02:40:18,870 --> 02:40:19,670
Turn around.

2143
02:40:20,389 --> 02:40:21,750
Turn around.

2144
02:40:21,750 --> 02:40:22,870
Oh, my fucking God.

2145
02:40:22,870 --> 02:40:23,829
Why am I stuck here?

2146
02:40:24,709 --> 02:40:27,329
Thank you.

2147
02:40:27,969 --> 02:40:43,270
All right, there we go.

2148
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:50,690
Good.

2149
02:40:50,690 --> 02:40:51,569
Is he dead?

2150
02:40:51,569 --> 02:40:52,709
Nice.

2151
02:40:52,709 --> 02:40:52,950
All right.

2152
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:53,590
I got a lot of points.

2153
02:40:56,129 --> 02:40:57,250
Force Lightning Andy.

2154
02:40:57,889 --> 02:40:59,329
I'm going to get new abilities.

2155
02:40:59,329 --> 02:40:59,809
Don't worry.

2156
02:41:00,530 --> 02:41:16,680
I need to get Vortex.

2157
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:18,840
That's what I want.

2158
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:35,520
Shock.

2159
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:36,079
Shock.

2160
02:41:36,079 --> 02:41:36,879
Shock.

2161
02:41:36,879 --> 02:41:39,059
I do need to do melee, though.

2162
02:41:39,059 --> 02:41:41,379
I can't just not do melee.

2163
02:41:41,379 --> 02:41:43,409
How am I ever going to have health?

2164
02:41:49,719 --> 02:41:50,680
He's so bad.

2165
02:41:51,239 --> 02:41:51,959
Why am I bad?

2166
02:42:01,799 --> 02:42:02,520
Shut up.

2167
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:08,639
Give these guys migraines so they fight each other.

2168
02:42:08,639 --> 02:42:19,750
Fight each other.

2169
02:42:19,750 --> 02:42:20,309
Do something.

2170
02:42:20,950 --> 02:42:24,100
All these level one spells are awful.

2171
02:42:24,659 --> 02:42:38,420
There's no mana.

2172
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:39,459
No, there's no mana in the game.

2173
02:42:39,459 --> 02:42:40,340
That's right.

2174
02:42:40,340 --> 02:42:46,930
Look at this wooden ass sword, too.

2175
02:42:47,649 --> 02:42:52,209
Yeah, I'm going full Vortex.

2176
02:42:53,170 --> 02:42:55,250
I'm going to make Vortex my number one move.

2177
02:42:55,969 --> 02:43:08,180
Let's go.

2178
02:43:08,180 --> 02:43:12,309
There are no health bars other than your own.

2179
02:43:12,309 --> 02:43:13,030
That's true, too.

2180
02:43:13,829 --> 02:43:17,670
Watch out.

2181
02:43:17,670 --> 02:43:18,149
Don't die.

2182
02:43:18,149 --> 02:43:19,590
I can't die in Fable 2.

2183
02:43:19,590 --> 02:43:21,190
Not in the first two levels.

2184
02:43:21,190 --> 02:43:22,149
That would be embarrassing.

2185
02:43:22,950 --> 02:43:25,700
I'm stuck again.

2186
02:43:26,340 --> 02:43:27,860
Why am I stuck doing this again?

2187
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:39,829
Fuck.

2188
02:43:40,709 --> 02:43:45,170
This is fun.

2189
02:43:45,170 --> 02:43:46,129
This is a fun game.

2190
02:43:46,770 --> 02:43:59,920
Let's go.

2191
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:01,680
I'm not as experienced as whatever.

2192
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:02,879
What the fuck is this?

2193
02:44:02,879 --> 02:44:04,159
This is Fable 2, man.

2194
02:44:07,620 --> 02:44:08,340
Fable 2.

2195
02:44:08,899 --> 02:44:09,219
Wait.

2196
02:44:09,219 --> 02:44:10,180
Give me that.

2197
02:44:10,180 --> 02:44:16,930
Did I miss?

2198
02:44:19,639 --> 02:44:20,280
I admitted something.

2199
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:20,840
What did I admit?

2200
02:44:21,399 --> 02:44:31,170
Buy Vortex.

2201
02:44:31,170 --> 02:44:32,129
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2202
02:44:32,129 --> 02:44:34,979
Let's do that.

2203
02:44:34,979 --> 02:44:35,219
Will.

2204
02:44:36,479 --> 02:44:37,440
Shock 2.

2205
02:44:38,959 --> 02:44:40,000
I could do Shock 2, though.

2206
02:44:43,860 --> 02:44:44,420
Vortex.

2207
02:44:45,569 --> 02:44:46,770
Yeah, I want Vortex.

2208
02:44:48,500 --> 02:44:49,540
Powerful Whirlwinds.

2209
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:56,069
I can get level 2.

2210
02:44:56,069 --> 02:44:56,309
Done.

2211
02:44:58,340 --> 02:44:58,579
All right.

2212
02:44:58,579 --> 02:44:59,860
I have level 2 Vortex.

2213
02:45:07,829 --> 02:45:07,989
All right.

2214
02:45:07,989 --> 02:45:08,469
Let's do it.

2215
02:45:11,299 --> 02:45:12,819
You have several level one spells.

2216
02:45:15,239 --> 02:45:15,719
Oh, shit.

2217
02:45:15,719 --> 02:45:16,600
This is level one.

2218
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:17,399
This is level two.

2219
02:45:19,170 --> 02:45:19,569
What does it do?

2220
02:45:20,850 --> 02:45:21,489
Oh, fuck.

2221
02:45:26,389 --> 02:45:27,430
Now it's level two.

2222
02:45:27,989 --> 02:45:30,639
Oh, my God.

2223
02:45:30,639 --> 02:45:30,879
All right.

2224
02:45:30,879 --> 02:45:32,079
This is going to be kind of insane.

2225
02:45:40,629 --> 02:45:42,870
I can't just cast Lightning Bolt exclusively.

2226
02:45:42,870 --> 02:45:43,750
No, apparently not.

2227
02:45:44,309 --> 02:45:51,000
Do Lightning and Vortex.

2228
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,299
That sounds pretty good.

2229
02:45:53,299 --> 02:45:54,100
Grab them in the Vortex,

2230
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:54,899
and when they're spinning around,

2231
02:45:54,899 --> 02:45:55,780
lightning the fuck out of them.

2232
02:45:57,479 --> 02:45:59,319
Yeah, I'll be Storm.

2233
02:46:06,069 --> 02:46:07,030
Storm Mage.

2234
02:46:07,909 --> 02:46:14,639
Do I have any food?

2235
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:19,329
Throw potions.

2236
02:46:20,930 --> 02:46:21,569
Oh, here we go.

2237
02:46:21,569 --> 02:46:22,290
Yeah.

2238
02:46:22,290 --> 02:46:23,520
What's this?

2239
02:46:24,159 --> 02:46:28,530
100% natural state ingredients.

2240
02:46:28,530 --> 02:46:29,329
Combat drink?

2241
02:46:37,719 --> 02:46:37,879
What?

2242
02:46:42,290 --> 02:46:43,090
Oh, it's these guys.

2243
02:46:43,090 --> 02:46:43,809
It's the bridge guys.

2244
02:46:43,809 --> 02:46:44,049
All right.

2245
02:46:44,049 --> 02:46:44,850
Let's Vortex them.

2246
02:47:05,190 --> 02:47:07,350
I can just shoot them when they're doing that.

2247
02:47:07,350 --> 02:47:08,309
Oh, that's kind of cool.

2248
02:47:19,620 --> 02:47:20,340
It's a cool move,

2249
02:47:20,340 --> 02:47:25,350
but I will tell you that's really loud

2250
02:47:25,350 --> 02:47:26,309
and really annoying.

2251
02:47:29,030 --> 02:47:30,069
That's very loud,

2252
02:47:30,069 --> 02:47:32,229
and I have to do that every time I want to do a move.

2253
02:47:32,870 --> 02:47:39,520
Do Storm 2, then Lightning 1.

2254
02:47:40,159 --> 02:47:48,520
All right.

2255
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:49,319
Where is it?

2256
02:47:49,319 --> 02:47:54,450
Good job, boy.

2257
02:47:55,010 --> 02:48:00,290
You look like Cosplay Jack Sparrow.

2258
02:48:14,020 --> 02:48:16,659
I look like any convention Jack Sparrow.

2259
02:48:16,659 --> 02:48:21,959
You know that guy that just dresses up as Jack Sparrow?

2260
02:48:21,959 --> 02:48:23,639
Doesn't really matter what the convention is.

2261
02:48:23,639 --> 02:48:30,549
Like, this could be like a lawyer convention.

2262
02:48:31,110 --> 02:48:34,440
A meeting of the attorneys-at-law,

2263
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:36,760
and there would be a Jack Sparrow there.

2264
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:46,520
The Association of Restaurant Managers Conference.

2265
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:48,260
There'll be two Jack Sparrows there.

2266
02:48:57,799 --> 02:48:58,520
Eat more food.

2267
02:48:58,520 --> 02:48:58,760
I will.

2268
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:00,200
I just had to do some quests.

2269
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:07,079
You'll find it.

2270
02:49:07,079 --> 02:49:08,530
Come on.

2271
02:49:08,530 --> 02:49:09,010
You'll find it.

2272
02:49:09,010 --> 02:49:09,409
Where is it?

2273
02:49:10,469 --> 02:49:11,110
Where is it?

2274
02:49:11,110 --> 02:49:11,510
Come on.

2275
02:49:11,510 --> 02:49:11,829
Get it.

2276
02:49:12,770 --> 02:49:13,489
Pick up the scent.

2277
02:49:13,489 --> 02:49:14,049
You can do it.

2278
02:49:14,049 --> 02:49:14,850
There we go.

2279
02:49:14,850 --> 02:49:16,659
That's a good dog.

2280
02:49:17,219 --> 02:49:20,930
I saw Jack Sparrow at 4th of July once.

2281
02:49:20,930 --> 02:49:21,170
Right.

2282
02:49:21,170 --> 02:49:21,729
It doesn't matter.

2283
02:49:21,729 --> 02:49:23,569
Any large gathering.

2284
02:49:23,569 --> 02:49:30,469
Guys, if there's too many people in line at the ice cream store,

2285
02:49:30,469 --> 02:49:32,149
a Jack Sparrow will show up.

2286
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:44,819
Okay.

2287
02:49:44,819 --> 02:49:47,329
So what do we got here?

2288
02:49:47,329 --> 02:49:51,569
Let's go.

2289
02:49:52,129 --> 02:49:57,920
This is Manure Manor.

2290
02:49:58,479 --> 02:49:59,440
I can buy this right now.

2291
02:50:02,770 --> 02:50:03,969
Owners killed.

2292
02:50:04,610 --> 02:50:10,280
Knock on this door.

2293
02:50:10,280 --> 02:50:12,600
If you want to commit vandalism, you could just...

2294
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:15,299
Good evening.

2295
02:50:15,299 --> 02:50:17,399
Someone just tried to flirt with you.

2296
02:50:19,479 --> 02:50:20,440
Who's flirting with me?

2297
02:50:21,159 --> 02:50:25,700
Who's flirting with me?

2298
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:40,239
Oh, you still want me to leave?

2299
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:42,799
Oh, you want me to leave?

2300
02:50:42,799 --> 02:50:43,120
Leave?

2301
02:50:43,120 --> 02:50:43,680
Are you sure?

2302
02:50:44,399 --> 02:50:44,799
Did you see?

2303
02:50:44,799 --> 02:50:45,280
Oh, yeah.

2304
02:50:45,280 --> 02:50:46,879
Oh, you liked that a little bit though.

2305
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:49,040
Are you sure you want me to leave?

2306
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:50,479
Well, I can do this.

2307
02:50:54,850 --> 02:50:55,809
You love that though.

2308
02:51:01,639 --> 02:51:09,829
What?

2309
02:51:09,829 --> 02:51:11,190
You love me.

2310
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:11,989
You love me.

2311
02:51:12,629 --> 02:51:13,379
All right.

2312
02:51:13,379 --> 02:51:14,500
Take what they have in the fridge.

2313
02:51:14,500 --> 02:51:15,299
Take everything.

2314
02:51:15,299 --> 02:51:28,000
Got more shit?

2315
02:51:28,559 --> 02:51:35,270
I'll be gone before they fucking even know I was here.

2316
02:51:35,270 --> 02:51:39,559
Holy shit.

2317
02:51:39,559 --> 02:51:40,200
What else they have?

2318
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:40,920
Take it all.

2319
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:43,600
There's no guards in this town.

2320
02:51:43,600 --> 02:51:44,399
There are no guards.

2321
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:51,559
Rancid water.

2322
02:51:51,559 --> 02:51:53,649
Anything?

2323
02:51:53,649 --> 02:51:54,610
What else you got?

2324
02:51:54,610 --> 02:51:55,010
Sleep?

2325
02:51:55,649 --> 02:51:58,559
Wait, I'm sleeping in their bed?

2326
02:51:58,559 --> 02:52:02,549
No, I don't want to do that.

2327
02:52:02,549 --> 02:52:03,590
I want to get out of here.

2328
02:52:03,590 --> 02:52:08,610
All right.

2329
02:52:08,610 --> 02:52:09,170
Let's get the fuck out.

2330
02:52:09,170 --> 02:52:09,729
Go, go, go.

2331
02:52:09,729 --> 02:52:10,290
Out.

2332
02:52:10,370 --> 02:52:23,959
All right.

2333
02:52:23,959 --> 02:52:31,879
We got to like hide.

2334
02:52:31,879 --> 02:52:33,239
I'm like a squirrel.

2335
02:52:33,239 --> 02:52:35,030
I just stole a bunch of food in their house

2336
02:52:35,030 --> 02:52:36,149
and I ran around the corner and like

2337
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:47,059
Hob water.

2338
02:52:47,059 --> 02:52:47,940
What does this do?

2339
02:52:47,940 --> 02:52:50,520
I don't know.

2340
02:52:50,520 --> 02:52:51,079
Drink it.

2341
02:52:51,079 --> 02:52:55,760
What are those bells?

2342
02:52:56,879 --> 02:52:59,270
Are those like rancid water?

2343
02:52:59,270 --> 02:53:03,299
Smells like eggs.

2344
02:53:12,399 --> 02:53:19,459
50 gold.

2345
02:53:19,459 --> 02:53:19,780
Fine.

2346
02:53:19,780 --> 02:53:20,180
Take it.

2347
02:53:20,180 --> 02:53:20,739
Get out.

2348
02:53:20,739 --> 02:53:22,850
That's nothing.

2349
02:53:22,850 --> 02:53:23,170
Take it.

2350
02:53:33,360 --> 02:53:35,760
What is this?

2351
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:36,559
Woodcutter.

2352
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:40,440
What happened to being a good boy?

2353
02:53:41,159 --> 02:53:46,469
I can be a bad person,

2354
02:53:46,469 --> 02:53:47,829
but a good boy.

2355
02:53:47,829 --> 02:53:49,829
No, I can be a good person,

2356
02:53:49,829 --> 02:53:50,549
but a bad boy.

2357
02:53:50,549 --> 02:53:51,030
There you go.

2358
02:53:54,770 --> 02:53:55,969
I'm a good person,

2359
02:53:55,969 --> 02:53:56,690
but I'm a bad boy.

2360
02:53:59,569 --> 02:54:04,559
You can also be a bad boy,

2361
02:54:04,559 --> 02:54:05,360
but a good person.

2362
02:54:05,360 --> 02:54:06,079
Good person, but...

2363
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:06,399
No, no.

2364
02:54:06,399 --> 02:54:06,959
What is...

2365
02:54:06,959 --> 02:54:07,920
Say that in reverse.

2366
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:08,639
A good person,

2367
02:54:08,639 --> 02:54:11,059
but a bad boy.

2368
02:54:11,059 --> 02:54:11,780
A good boy,

2369
02:54:11,780 --> 02:54:12,579
but a bad person.

2370
02:54:12,579 --> 02:54:13,139
That's not me.

2371
02:54:13,139 --> 02:54:14,500
I am a good...

2372
02:54:14,500 --> 02:54:15,139
What's going on?

2373
02:54:15,139 --> 02:54:15,860
Get away from me.

2374
02:54:15,860 --> 02:54:23,270
Slow down and say it.

2375
02:54:23,270 --> 02:54:24,709
Okay.

2376
02:54:24,709 --> 02:54:26,309
You can be a good boy,

2377
02:54:26,309 --> 02:54:27,510
but a bad person.

2378
02:54:27,510 --> 02:54:34,610
That's not me.

2379
02:54:34,610 --> 02:54:35,889
I am a bad boy,

2380
02:54:35,889 --> 02:54:37,090
but a good person.

2381
02:54:37,090 --> 02:54:39,430
Did I say the same thing twice?

2382
02:54:50,370 --> 02:54:51,649
Say it slower.

2383
02:54:51,649 --> 02:54:52,690
No, you get it.

2384
02:54:52,690 --> 02:54:53,489
You know what I mean.

2385
02:54:53,489 --> 02:54:56,129
Did I just get wood chips

2386
02:54:56,129 --> 02:54:56,850
in that girl's eyes?

2387
02:55:01,639 --> 02:55:02,520
I work for your dad.

2388
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:05,329
Get out of here.

2389
02:55:05,329 --> 02:55:05,809
What?

2390
02:55:05,809 --> 02:55:22,149
How am I going to get...

2391
02:55:22,149 --> 02:55:23,030
I don't want to do another

2392
02:55:23,030 --> 02:55:24,469
get promoted job.

2393
02:55:24,469 --> 02:55:30,100
How are you a good person?

2394
02:55:31,379 --> 02:55:33,219
I unlock that cage

2395
02:55:33,219 --> 02:55:33,860
and let the person out.

2396
02:55:33,860 --> 02:55:35,239
Let the people out.

2397
02:55:35,239 --> 02:55:36,520
All the time the bandits have been like,

2398
02:55:36,520 --> 02:55:37,559
I'll give you free gold

2399
02:55:37,559 --> 02:55:38,760
if you just give me the warrants.

2400
02:55:38,760 --> 02:55:39,319
Nope.

2401
02:55:52,049 --> 02:55:52,930
I'm only getting eight gold

2402
02:55:52,930 --> 02:55:53,809
for this shit.

2403
02:55:53,809 --> 02:55:59,670
This is a horrible amount of gold.

2404
02:55:59,670 --> 02:56:01,879
How have I been a bad boy?

2405
02:56:03,379 --> 02:56:04,340
I stole a bunch of stuff.

2406
02:56:05,139 --> 02:56:06,579
I made a fart noise

2407
02:56:06,579 --> 02:56:07,299
in front of somebody

2408
02:56:07,299 --> 02:56:09,620
in front of the person's...

2409
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:10,260
I went in their house.

2410
02:56:10,260 --> 02:56:11,620
I farted and danced in their house.

2411
02:56:19,649 --> 02:56:21,250
Multiplier has stopped at three.

2412
02:56:21,250 --> 02:56:22,370
Oh, I've been promoted.

2413
02:56:22,370 --> 02:56:23,170
Shit.

2414
02:56:23,170 --> 02:56:32,629
That's bad person behavior.

2415
02:56:32,629 --> 02:56:33,190
No, it's not.

2416
02:56:34,520 --> 02:56:35,559
Bad person...

2417
02:56:35,559 --> 02:56:36,920
Bad person behavior

2418
02:56:36,920 --> 02:56:39,000
is if I did not let them out

2419
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,959
and I made a deal with the bandit.

2420
02:56:41,959 --> 02:56:47,969
You can be a good person,

2421
02:56:47,969 --> 02:56:48,930
but a bad boy.

2422
02:56:56,559 --> 02:56:57,600
You can be a bad person

2423
02:56:57,600 --> 02:56:58,239
and a good boy.

2424
02:56:58,799 --> 02:57:15,959
You drove a family out of their home

2425
02:57:15,959 --> 02:57:16,920
and you stole their food.

2426
02:57:17,639 --> 02:57:18,280
No.

2427
02:57:18,280 --> 02:57:21,159
I danced so widely,

2428
02:57:21,159 --> 02:57:21,879
entertainingly.

2429
02:57:22,840 --> 02:57:23,319
By the way,

2430
02:57:23,319 --> 02:57:26,930
all three of them loved it

2431
02:57:26,930 --> 02:57:28,129
that they ran away

2432
02:57:28,129 --> 02:57:30,239
because they couldn't believe

2433
02:57:30,239 --> 02:57:31,280
how fun it was.

2434
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:32,559
And they needed to go find

2435
02:57:32,559 --> 02:57:33,600
all the people in the town

2436
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:34,959
to come watch me.

2437
02:57:34,959 --> 02:57:39,139
And I just helped myself

2438
02:57:39,139 --> 02:57:40,340
to the stuff that was in their fridge.

2439
02:57:40,979 --> 02:57:52,129
Somebody said,

2440
02:57:52,129 --> 02:57:53,170
go watch Megamind.

2441
02:57:53,170 --> 02:57:53,809
You'll love it.

2442
02:57:54,690 --> 02:57:56,610
Why would I like Megamind?

2443
02:57:56,610 --> 02:58:07,170
Why would I watch...

2444
02:58:08,149 --> 02:58:10,069
I don't want to watch Megamind.

2445
02:58:10,629 --> 02:58:16,739
You know, I wrote Megamind off

2446
02:58:18,319 --> 02:58:19,520
because I just figured

2447
02:58:19,520 --> 02:58:20,719
it was Will Ferrell movie

2448
02:58:20,719 --> 02:58:22,639
number like 55 or whatever.

2449
02:58:22,639 --> 02:58:35,940
Megamind's a villain like you.

2450
02:58:37,889 --> 02:58:39,670
Why am I a villain?

2451
02:58:39,670 --> 02:58:40,399
What did I do?

2452
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:44,739
Well, the only reason why

2453
02:58:44,739 --> 02:58:45,620
you guys are saying Megamind

2454
02:58:45,620 --> 02:58:46,260
was a good movie

2455
02:58:46,260 --> 02:58:46,899
is because that's where

2456
02:58:46,899 --> 02:58:47,860
penis music is from.

2457
02:59:01,719 --> 02:59:03,090
That's false.

2458
02:59:03,090 --> 02:59:03,489
That's not.

2459
02:59:05,489 --> 02:59:15,809
Yeah, I probably would like Megamind.

2460
02:59:15,809 --> 02:59:16,129
You're right.

2461
02:59:19,719 --> 02:59:22,000
Maybe I'll watch it tonight.

2462
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:27,139
I'll watch it.

2463
02:59:27,620 --> 02:59:28,260
I'll watch it later.

2464
02:59:28,899 --> 02:59:33,459
I will give you guys

2465
02:59:33,459 --> 02:59:35,780
my assessment of Megamind tomorrow.

2466
02:59:35,780 --> 02:59:36,879
Just kidding.

2467
02:59:36,879 --> 02:59:37,760
I'm not watching that tonight.

2468
02:59:45,399 --> 02:59:46,280
I don't need any more money.

2469
02:59:46,280 --> 02:59:46,520
I'm good.

2470
02:59:47,319 --> 02:59:48,440
I am going to buy this house, though.

2471
02:59:48,440 --> 02:59:49,079
I'm buying the farm.

2472
02:59:49,719 --> 02:59:53,139
This thing's...

2473
02:59:53,139 --> 02:59:54,579
It's only 2,800...

2474
02:59:54,579 --> 02:59:55,540
4,600 bucks.

2475
02:59:56,100 --> 02:59:58,149
Did I buy it and move in?

2476
02:59:58,709 --> 03:00:00,370
I want it.

2477
03:00:00,370 --> 03:00:01,170
It's mine.

2478
03:00:01,170 --> 03:00:03,860
This is my house.

2479
03:00:19,219 --> 03:00:20,340
Animal magnetism?

2480
03:00:21,059 --> 03:00:31,190
All right, cool.

2481
03:00:31,190 --> 03:00:31,989
So now I have a house.

2482
03:00:32,709 --> 03:00:33,590
My house is the farm.

2483
03:00:34,229 --> 03:00:36,770
I could rent it out, though, couldn't I?

2484
03:00:40,180 --> 03:00:40,579
Rent out.

2485
03:00:40,579 --> 03:00:41,299
How much could I rent?

2486
03:00:41,860 --> 03:00:46,600
This is not a bad idea.

2487
03:00:53,280 --> 03:00:54,879
I'll get $50 every five minutes.

2488
03:00:55,440 --> 03:01:03,700
I'll take it.

2489
03:01:03,700 --> 03:01:03,940
All right.

2490
03:01:03,940 --> 03:01:09,440
Where am I going?

2491
03:01:09,440 --> 03:01:13,170
You can improve it with decorations

2492
03:01:13,170 --> 03:01:13,969
to increase the price.

2493
03:01:14,770 --> 03:01:17,010
I slept in it for one day.

2494
03:01:17,010 --> 03:01:17,969
Yeah, well, I don't...

2495
03:01:17,969 --> 03:01:18,770
I need to like make...

2496
03:01:18,770 --> 03:01:20,530
I need to have like a family first.

2497
03:01:20,530 --> 03:01:28,600
How much is this place?

2498
03:01:28,600 --> 03:01:28,920
Please.

2499
03:01:29,559 --> 03:01:35,299
6,400.

2500
03:01:35,299 --> 03:01:45,399
Anybody here?

2501
03:01:45,399 --> 03:01:50,930
Open the door, then.

2502
03:01:50,930 --> 03:01:53,760
Open the door.

2503
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:55,219
I have something very important.

2504
03:01:55,219 --> 03:01:56,659
I'm the goddamn quest guy.

2505
03:01:56,659 --> 03:01:58,020
I'm saving this town.

2506
03:01:58,020 --> 03:01:59,219
I need to ask you stuff.

2507
03:01:59,219 --> 03:02:08,340
My head.

2508
03:02:21,139 --> 03:02:32,159
Oh, shit.

2509
03:02:32,159 --> 03:02:32,959
They opened the door.

2510
03:02:37,319 --> 03:02:37,719
Hello.

2511
03:02:44,290 --> 03:02:44,930
Thank you.

2512
03:02:44,930 --> 03:02:46,610
I have a master woodcutter.

2513
03:02:46,610 --> 03:02:47,010
You're right.

2514
03:02:49,829 --> 03:02:50,389
You think so?

2515
03:03:13,520 --> 03:03:15,520
Why would you run to their bathroom?

2516
03:03:15,520 --> 03:03:17,520
Why would you run to their bathroom?

2517
03:03:18,079 --> 03:03:18,719
They pay me?

2518
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:26,770
Quality item.

2519
03:03:26,770 --> 03:03:28,209
Why would I run out of their house?

2520
03:03:29,010 --> 03:03:30,129
Run to the bathroom?

2521
03:03:34,079 --> 03:03:34,719
Oh, man.

2522
03:03:35,440 --> 03:03:35,760
All right.

2523
03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:36,479
What am I...

2524
03:03:36,479 --> 03:03:37,520
Where's the breadcrumbs going?

2525
03:03:41,540 --> 03:03:42,739
Oh, I need more breadcrumbs.

2526
03:03:42,739 --> 03:03:45,120
You're an adventurer, right?

2527
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:45,680
What's going on?

2528
03:03:48,479 --> 03:03:49,600
Why are the breadcrumbs not...

2529
03:03:52,200 --> 03:03:53,239
I need breadcrumbs.

2530
03:03:53,239 --> 03:03:54,680
I can't function without them.

2531
03:03:55,239 --> 03:04:00,149
What do I have to do to this guy?

2532
03:04:00,149 --> 03:04:02,180
Whoa, put it back.

2533
03:04:02,180 --> 03:04:02,659
Put it back.

2534
03:04:02,659 --> 03:04:03,059
Put it back.

2535
03:04:03,059 --> 03:04:03,540
How do I put it down?

2536
03:04:03,540 --> 03:04:04,180
Put it down.

2537
03:04:04,180 --> 03:04:05,379
Put it down.

2538
03:04:05,379 --> 03:04:05,940
Put the gun down.

2539
03:04:05,940 --> 03:04:06,260
Put it down.

2540
03:04:06,260 --> 03:04:07,059
Put it down.

2541
03:04:07,059 --> 03:04:07,379
Put it down.

2542
03:04:07,379 --> 03:04:08,340
How do I put things down?

2543
03:04:08,899 --> 03:04:09,540
Quick, quick.

2544
03:04:09,540 --> 03:04:10,819
Make somebody laugh.

2545
03:04:10,819 --> 03:04:19,510
Nobody liked that.

2546
03:04:19,510 --> 03:04:19,670
All right.

2547
03:04:19,670 --> 03:04:20,870
I have to get out of this town.

2548
03:04:20,870 --> 03:04:25,040
Put that cookie down now.

2549
03:04:25,760 --> 03:04:29,299
Oh, look.

2550
03:04:29,299 --> 03:04:30,340
This person likes me.

2551
03:04:30,340 --> 03:04:31,219
You want to have tea?

2552
03:04:31,860 --> 03:04:34,680
You all right?

2553
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:46,899
Okay.

2554
03:04:46,899 --> 03:04:47,700
Do I have any presents?

2555
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:48,739
I do have a present, don't I?

2556
03:04:51,879 --> 03:04:52,440
Oh, thank you.

2557
03:04:57,329 --> 03:04:57,729
Thank you.

2558
03:05:02,770 --> 03:05:03,700
All right.

2559
03:05:03,700 --> 03:05:04,340
So now how do I...

2560
03:05:05,540 --> 03:05:09,430
I need info.

2561
03:05:10,149 --> 03:05:11,319
Social.

2562
03:05:14,389 --> 03:05:14,870
Follow me.

2563
03:05:22,239 --> 03:05:22,719
Come with me.

2564
03:05:26,739 --> 03:05:28,020
Wait, what did you say?

2565
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:29,719
What did you say?

2566
03:05:29,719 --> 03:05:30,440
Who said that?

2567
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:31,079
Did you say that?

2568
03:05:31,879 --> 03:05:33,190
What did you say?

2569
03:05:36,959 --> 03:05:37,280
Yes.

2570
03:05:37,280 --> 03:05:47,620
A game master?

2571
03:05:55,590 --> 03:05:55,989
I can't.

2572
03:05:56,870 --> 03:05:59,139
Play Spinner Box a tutorial.

2573
03:05:59,780 --> 03:06:02,209
A spinner box is a decorative box

2574
03:06:02,209 --> 03:06:05,010
containing several devices called flit switches.

2575
03:06:05,569 --> 03:06:07,489
A flit switch is a magical spinner

2576
03:06:07,489 --> 03:06:09,409
that will randomly cycle through a variety of symbols.

2577
03:06:09,409 --> 03:06:11,569
To play this, just place your bet and spin.

2578
03:06:11,569 --> 03:06:15,270
What do I need to do?

2579
03:06:15,270 --> 03:06:19,729
Okay.

2580
03:06:19,729 --> 03:06:21,649
This is cow and corset.

2581
03:06:22,129 --> 03:06:24,450
A three-switch spinner box.

2582
03:06:24,450 --> 03:06:26,530
Raise your bet to six gold and spin.

2583
03:06:26,530 --> 03:06:27,250
Okay, spin it.

2584
03:06:30,549 --> 03:06:31,909
I want to bet more than six.

2585
03:06:32,629 --> 03:06:38,389
As you can see, not every spin is a winner.

2586
03:06:38,950 --> 03:06:43,459
Four more adjacent symbols of the same type.

2587
03:06:43,459 --> 03:06:51,170
Here we go.

2588
03:06:51,170 --> 03:06:55,000
Look at that.

2589
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:55,799
Bigger chains.

2590
03:06:55,799 --> 03:06:56,120
Okay.

2591
03:06:56,840 --> 03:07:01,219
Oh, nice.

2592
03:07:01,219 --> 03:07:01,780
All right, let's go.

2593
03:07:04,389 --> 03:07:06,469
Why can I not do a more than 10 bet?

2594
03:07:06,469 --> 03:07:11,319
It's just fantasy slots.

2595
03:07:11,319 --> 03:07:11,819
Yeah.

2596
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:13,239
Look at that.

2597
03:07:13,239 --> 03:07:14,360
Look at how much money I just made.

2598
03:07:16,239 --> 03:07:17,280
600 gold?

2599
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:19,280
If I had bet 20 bucks,

2600
03:07:19,280 --> 03:07:31,090
that would have been like five grand.

2601
03:07:31,090 --> 03:07:33,170
Imagine needing a tutorial for a slot machine.

2602
03:07:33,809 --> 03:07:41,440
Okay.

2603
03:07:41,440 --> 03:07:49,239
Free spins.

2604
03:07:49,239 --> 03:07:50,200
This is just a slot machine.

2605
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:51,399
Why do I even need a tutorial?

2606
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:56,709
Cool.

2607
03:07:56,709 --> 03:07:57,030
All right.

2608
03:07:57,030 --> 03:07:57,590
Yeah, I get it.

2609
03:07:58,979 --> 03:08:00,959
All right.

2610
03:08:00,959 --> 03:08:01,520
You pay out.

2611
03:08:01,520 --> 03:08:01,840
It's cool.

2612
03:08:02,719 --> 03:08:03,920
Are we ready?

2613
03:08:03,920 --> 03:08:04,319
Let's go.

2614
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:11,920
All right.

2615
03:08:11,920 --> 03:08:12,799
Adjust bet.

2616
03:08:12,799 --> 03:08:15,700
It's a max bet.

2617
03:08:16,340 --> 03:08:16,579
10?

2618
03:08:21,459 --> 03:08:22,899
I can only put 10 bucks in here?

2619
03:08:23,700 --> 03:08:42,340
Here we go.

2620
03:08:42,340 --> 03:08:43,139
There we go.

2621
03:08:43,139 --> 03:08:49,079
All right.

2622
03:08:49,079 --> 03:08:49,799
Let me make...

2623
03:08:49,799 --> 03:08:56,280
Let me get a bonus and I'll leave.

2624
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:57,239
Pack it up, boys.

2625
03:08:57,239 --> 03:08:57,719
No.

2626
03:08:57,719 --> 03:08:58,280
Pack...

2627
03:08:58,280 --> 03:08:59,000
Stay here.

2628
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:17,000
To make the amount of spins larger.

2629
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:17,879
What is with these spins?

2630
03:09:24,690 --> 03:09:26,049
How am I not winning any money?

2631
03:09:26,049 --> 03:09:34,520
What the fuck is that?

2632
03:09:34,520 --> 03:09:40,149
What the fuck?

2633
03:09:40,149 --> 03:09:41,110
Build a bank up.

2634
03:09:41,110 --> 03:09:53,809
All right.

2635
03:09:53,809 --> 03:09:56,049
That's a super bonus cow spin.

2636
03:09:56,049 --> 03:09:58,319
That's 500.

2637
03:09:58,319 --> 03:10:00,659
I'm good.

2638
03:10:00,659 --> 03:10:01,219
I'm still here.

2639
03:10:01,219 --> 03:10:01,860
Let's go.

2640
03:10:01,860 --> 03:10:07,639
One more of those and I'll leave.

2641
03:10:07,639 --> 03:10:26,069
House, house, house.

2642
03:10:26,069 --> 03:10:27,270
Oh, come on.

2643
03:10:27,270 --> 03:10:29,520
Timed?

2644
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:30,559
It better not be.

2645
03:10:30,559 --> 03:10:44,600
As far as slot machines go,

2646
03:10:44,600 --> 03:10:45,719
this is really dull.

2647
03:10:45,719 --> 03:10:47,239
It kind of is, isn't it?

2648
03:10:47,239 --> 03:10:52,149
Here we go.

2649
03:10:52,149 --> 03:10:52,950
Guys, I made 100 bucks.

2650
03:11:08,159 --> 03:11:10,000
Oh, he's hyper speed spinning.

2651
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:11,520
Somebody get him off the machine.

2652
03:11:11,520 --> 03:11:12,399
Get him off the machine.

2653
03:11:12,399 --> 03:11:13,520
He's hyper spinning.

2654
03:11:13,520 --> 03:11:14,930
Get him off.

2655
03:11:14,930 --> 03:11:15,409
Get him off.

2656
03:11:15,409 --> 03:11:15,969
All right.

2657
03:11:16,049 --> 03:11:17,010
Cash out, cash out, cash out.

2658
03:11:17,010 --> 03:11:17,569
Grab him.

2659
03:11:17,569 --> 03:11:18,530
Grab him.

2660
03:11:18,530 --> 03:11:19,010
Grab him.

2661
03:11:19,010 --> 03:11:19,489
Just grab him.

2662
03:11:20,129 --> 03:11:21,170
No, what happened?

2663
03:11:21,889 --> 03:11:24,739
All right.

2664
03:11:24,739 --> 03:11:25,059
We're good.

2665
03:11:25,059 --> 03:11:28,000
I'm losing your money.

2666
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:30,159
Hey, debt.

2667
03:11:30,159 --> 03:11:31,760
What the fuck is this?

2668
03:11:31,760 --> 03:11:34,209
What do you mean?

2669
03:11:34,209 --> 03:11:35,489
How much debt do I have?

2670
03:11:35,489 --> 03:11:36,129
What is that?

2671
03:11:39,680 --> 03:11:40,399
What?

2672
03:11:40,399 --> 03:11:52,069
Why do I have debt?

2673
03:11:52,069 --> 03:12:11,200
I'm going to take this to zero

2674
03:12:11,200 --> 03:12:12,000
and I'm going to leave.

2675
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:29,700
Come on.

2676
03:12:29,700 --> 03:12:35,219
Do it.

2677
03:12:35,219 --> 03:12:35,940
Yeah, I want to see.

2678
03:12:36,899 --> 03:12:38,340
I want to examine the machine.

2679
03:12:38,340 --> 03:12:40,819
I want the gaming board to look at this

2680
03:12:40,819 --> 03:12:42,100
and see if it's actually real.

2681
03:12:42,100 --> 03:12:44,079
This is bullshit.

2682
03:12:44,079 --> 03:12:56,500
That's the last one.

2683
03:12:56,500 --> 03:12:57,879
All right.

2684
03:12:57,879 --> 03:12:58,440
This is bullshit.

2685
03:12:58,440 --> 03:12:59,079
This thing sucks.

2686
03:13:02,180 --> 03:13:02,819
What?

2687
03:13:04,739 --> 03:13:06,020
Points to next level?

2688
03:13:07,170 --> 03:13:10,020
Why do I level up my gambling?

2689
03:13:10,959 --> 03:13:12,319
Is this like when you get the cards

2690
03:13:12,319 --> 03:13:13,520
at the casinos

2691
03:13:13,520 --> 03:13:14,479
where you build points

2692
03:13:14,479 --> 03:13:16,239
and eventually after like two years

2693
03:13:16,239 --> 03:13:16,799
of gambling,

2694
03:13:16,799 --> 03:13:18,079
they give you one free night

2695
03:13:18,079 --> 03:13:19,520
at a room at the hotel?

2696
03:13:26,899 --> 03:13:29,219
Imagine being a level five gambler.

2697
03:13:29,219 --> 03:13:30,180
I kind of want to do that.

2698
03:13:31,239 --> 03:13:33,079
I kind of want to be level five gambler.

2699
03:13:34,209 --> 03:13:35,329
I need to get to the next level.

2700
03:13:35,329 --> 03:13:35,889
I have to.

2701
03:13:43,559 --> 03:13:43,959
All right.

2702
03:13:43,959 --> 03:13:44,440
There was a...

2703
03:13:44,440 --> 03:13:45,639
We're supposed to be going on like a date.

2704
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:47,479
Come with me.

2705
03:13:48,040 --> 03:13:50,450
Come on in here.

2706
03:13:54,920 --> 03:13:56,200
And gold to hear the bard.

2707
03:14:11,940 --> 03:14:12,180
What?

2708
03:14:14,979 --> 03:14:16,819
Ever leave me again?

2709
03:14:17,620 --> 03:14:18,579
Holy shit.

2710
03:14:24,129 --> 03:14:25,280
Oh, let's dance.

2711
03:14:55,190 --> 03:14:56,709
Beg.

2712
03:15:00,709 --> 03:15:02,069
That was really nice.

2713
03:15:02,069 --> 03:15:02,469
Thank you.

2714
03:15:03,750 --> 03:15:05,840
That was wonderful.

2715
03:15:06,639 --> 03:15:09,590
Why are we all stuffed here?

2716
03:15:11,510 --> 03:15:11,750
Okay.

2717
03:15:11,750 --> 03:15:12,950
I want to know what you like.

2718
03:15:23,379 --> 03:15:23,540
Okay.

2719
03:15:23,540 --> 03:15:24,020
How do I get...

2720
03:15:24,020 --> 03:15:24,979
I want to know her needs.

2721
03:15:26,020 --> 03:15:26,260
All right.

2722
03:15:26,260 --> 03:15:26,659
Come with me.

2723
03:15:30,629 --> 03:15:32,450
Oh, there we go.

2724
03:15:32,450 --> 03:15:32,770
Gwyneth...

2725
03:15:32,770 --> 03:15:33,569
Wait, the farmer?

2726
03:15:34,290 --> 03:15:50,790
Wait, can we sleep somewhere?

2727
03:15:50,790 --> 03:15:51,590
Oh, barman.

2728
03:15:51,590 --> 03:15:52,229
All right.

2729
03:15:52,229 --> 03:15:53,780
This is a pretty good date.

2730
03:15:56,979 --> 03:15:57,219
Yeah.

2731
03:15:57,219 --> 03:15:58,260
Let's have to take a few of these.

2732
03:16:03,090 --> 03:16:03,729
Get some beer.

2733
03:16:07,190 --> 03:16:07,510
Rum.

2734
03:16:09,780 --> 03:16:10,850
Okay.

2735
03:16:10,850 --> 03:16:11,569
Here you go.

2736
03:16:11,569 --> 03:16:12,049
Do you want a drink?

2737
03:16:12,850 --> 03:16:13,409
Here.

2738
03:16:13,409 --> 03:16:15,799
I got you a drink.

2739
03:16:15,799 --> 03:16:20,129
Where's a gift?

2740
03:16:21,889 --> 03:16:22,850
A gift.

2741
03:16:22,850 --> 03:16:24,790
How about a...

2742
03:16:26,760 --> 03:16:27,719
Um...

2743
03:16:27,719 --> 03:16:33,459
Would you like a glass of rum?

2744
03:16:33,459 --> 03:16:38,049
All right.

2745
03:16:42,500 --> 03:16:45,040
Wait, this is the person that was already drunk?

2746
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:45,680
Oh.

2747
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:49,569
Well, I thought it was a different person.

2748
03:16:49,569 --> 03:16:49,889
All right.

2749
03:16:49,889 --> 03:16:51,170
Well, I'm going to drink something.

2750
03:16:51,170 --> 03:16:58,719
Oh, shit.

2751
03:16:58,719 --> 03:16:59,920
I almost just did the whirlwind.

2752
03:17:00,959 --> 03:17:02,979
I don't want to get drunk because I don't want to be like,

2753
03:17:02,979 --> 03:17:05,139
oh, you want to see a real cool trick?

2754
03:17:05,700 --> 03:17:06,979
Watch this shit.

2755
03:17:06,979 --> 03:17:08,819
And then cause a tornado inside of this place.

2756
03:17:16,319 --> 03:17:18,239
Level five gambling addict.

2757
03:17:19,040 --> 03:17:26,280
No, it's fun.

2758
03:17:26,840 --> 03:17:30,280
That's not going to actually destroy everything, will it?

2759
03:17:35,059 --> 03:17:36,930
More info.

2760
03:17:36,930 --> 03:17:37,569
Okay.

2761
03:17:37,569 --> 03:17:39,680
She likes to be seduced.

2762
03:17:43,239 --> 03:17:45,079
She currently thinks I'm kind of attractive.

2763
03:17:45,079 --> 03:17:46,440
She thinks I'm funny.

2764
03:17:46,440 --> 03:18:02,319
What do I do?

2765
03:18:02,319 --> 03:18:03,120
How do I stop this?

2766
03:18:03,120 --> 03:18:03,680
How do I stop?

2767
03:18:03,680 --> 03:18:04,959
How do I stop from doing this to them?

2768
03:18:05,680 --> 03:18:06,479
What's cancel?

2769
03:18:06,479 --> 03:18:07,120
What's cancel?

2770
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:08,000
How do I cancel?

2771
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:09,440
How do I cancel?

2772
03:18:09,440 --> 03:18:11,040
How do I cancel a spell?

2773
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:12,079
How do you cancel a spell?

2774
03:18:12,639 --> 03:18:14,079
Does anybody know how to cancel a spell?

2775
03:18:16,360 --> 03:18:18,520
I'm going to throw it into the bathroom.

2776
03:18:19,780 --> 03:18:20,659
I can't cancel it?

2777
03:18:26,049 --> 03:18:27,170
Oh shit, his bar.

2778
03:18:32,069 --> 03:18:32,709
What is this?

2779
03:18:33,510 --> 03:18:34,549
What's wrong with me?

2780
03:18:45,459 --> 03:18:46,579
They liked it.

2781
03:18:47,139 --> 03:18:48,020
They liked it?

2782
03:18:50,629 --> 03:18:51,270
Holy shit.

2783
03:18:51,270 --> 03:18:52,469
Why do they think this is cool?

2784
03:18:55,680 --> 03:18:56,799
You thought it was stupid?

2785
03:19:04,610 --> 03:19:05,969
You sure you want to tell the guy?

2786
03:19:16,579 --> 03:19:17,780
I would kill you right now.

2787
03:19:18,579 --> 03:19:20,500
If it wasn't for the guy that just pet the dog behind me.

2788
03:19:21,139 --> 03:19:23,540
So he just saved you.

2789
03:19:23,540 --> 03:19:25,409
He just saved you.

2790
03:19:25,409 --> 03:19:28,420
I was about to just drop the vortex right here, but he pet the dog.

2791
03:19:30,850 --> 03:19:31,729
Lucky fucking day.

2792
03:19:36,879 --> 03:19:38,159
All right, I want to let's go.

2793
03:19:45,729 --> 03:19:47,170
Ladies kind of freaking me out.

2794
03:19:57,680 --> 03:19:58,319
All right, let's go.

2795
03:19:58,319 --> 03:20:00,719
I let's I need to have I'm gonna buy a house and we can go sleep.

2796
03:20:01,600 --> 03:20:03,840
Is that what like what we're gonna do is am I gonna I have a ring.

2797
03:20:08,209 --> 03:20:15,000
You already own a house while I'm renting it right now.

2798
03:20:15,959 --> 03:20:19,399
Okay, you ready?

2799
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:23,760
You like this ring?

2800
03:20:25,600 --> 03:20:26,479
You're engaged.

2801
03:20:34,370 --> 03:20:35,250
Wait, who the fuck is this?

2802
03:20:37,729 --> 03:20:38,610
We only had a house.

2803
03:20:39,799 --> 03:20:42,360
You want to set your property manure manor as your target.

2804
03:20:43,360 --> 03:20:46,840
Yes, let's go.

2805
03:20:51,270 --> 03:20:52,229
What a name for a house.

2806
03:20:53,270 --> 03:20:54,309
Yes, my dear.

2807
03:20:54,309 --> 03:20:56,870
I'll take you back to my esteemed sedate.

2808
03:20:57,430 --> 03:20:59,110
Manure manor.

2809
03:21:06,280 --> 03:21:11,489
Which lives for only a few decades before producing a single golden acorn.

2810
03:21:12,129 --> 03:21:16,530
The monks of the temple of light replant this acorn and as the tree is reborn.

2811
03:21:16,530 --> 03:21:18,530
So are all the lands and farms around.

2812
03:21:19,409 --> 03:21:21,329
The Abbot is quite nervous about this year.

2813
03:21:23,809 --> 03:21:25,889
Get away from wait, wait, wait, should you not be here?

2814
03:21:26,770 --> 03:21:28,530
I feel like I'm afraid like doing moves.

2815
03:21:29,250 --> 03:21:31,360
Did she fight?

2816
03:21:32,079 --> 03:21:34,930
She didn't care.

2817
03:21:40,290 --> 03:21:41,489
This is weird.

2818
03:21:41,489 --> 03:21:43,250
All right, where's the house?

2819
03:21:43,969 --> 03:21:44,690
Where's our house?

2820
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:48,319
Wrong way.

2821
03:21:48,319 --> 03:21:58,850
Where's the map?

2822
03:21:58,850 --> 03:21:59,729
Where's my house?

2823
03:22:03,879 --> 03:22:04,920
In the middle of the street.

2824
03:22:07,360 --> 03:22:08,319
I don't, what street?

2825
03:22:14,520 --> 03:22:18,370
Like going towards it?

2826
03:22:18,370 --> 03:22:19,090
It's over here, right?

2827
03:22:19,649 --> 03:22:24,399
Is that it right there?

2828
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:27,840
Where's this breadcrumb?

2829
03:22:27,840 --> 03:22:29,840
This breadcrumb trail is not loading properly.

2830
03:22:30,959 --> 03:22:42,770
Oh, here we go.

2831
03:22:42,770 --> 03:22:43,250
It's up here.

2832
03:22:43,809 --> 03:22:50,690
All right, here it is.

2833
03:22:50,690 --> 03:22:51,250
Here's my house.

2834
03:22:51,969 --> 03:22:53,889
All right, come on in here.

2835
03:22:53,889 --> 03:22:56,709
This way.

2836
03:22:57,350 --> 03:23:02,159
Come on in.

2837
03:23:02,719 --> 03:23:04,069
It's our home.

2838
03:23:04,709 --> 03:23:07,750
Get in here.

2839
03:23:08,479 --> 03:23:09,680
All right, we did it.

2840
03:23:10,930 --> 03:23:11,569
We are here.

2841
03:23:12,290 --> 03:23:25,250
Okay, so now we're engaged and now we're going to...

2842
03:23:31,360 --> 03:23:31,920
What are we doing?

2843
03:23:31,920 --> 03:23:32,639
What do we do now?

2844
03:23:43,110 --> 03:23:43,350
Okay.

2845
03:23:49,940 --> 03:23:50,899
How do we make, how do we...

2846
03:23:52,020 --> 03:23:52,500
We're going to have...

2847
03:23:53,379 --> 03:23:54,899
Are we going to have like a child?

2848
03:23:57,459 --> 03:24:01,479
All right, so we're going to go to the sign outside the house.

2849
03:24:02,200 --> 03:24:07,860
Evict tenant.

2850
03:24:08,930 --> 03:24:10,770
Oh, set as marital home.

2851
03:24:20,440 --> 03:24:29,559
I met this person the last night.

2852
03:24:36,639 --> 03:24:39,889
I destroyed a bar and then we got married.

2853
03:24:40,450 --> 03:24:47,000
You've received a dowry of cash and a renowned boost.

2854
03:24:47,639 --> 03:24:49,639
You get better bonuses from your house.

2855
03:24:49,639 --> 03:24:50,840
You might also receive gifts.

2856
03:24:51,799 --> 03:24:54,040
Use the house sign to set your household budget.

2857
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:57,440
Maybe a household budget.

2858
03:25:01,559 --> 03:25:02,680
Household budget?

2859
03:25:04,200 --> 03:25:04,920
Uh, zero.

2860
03:25:07,430 --> 03:25:08,549
Daily deduction?

2861
03:25:10,209 --> 03:25:10,530
What?

2862
03:25:21,430 --> 03:25:23,430
What are you talking about?

2863
03:25:23,430 --> 03:25:25,760
This villager has a reward to give away.

2864
03:25:25,760 --> 03:25:27,440
Use the appropriate expression or give them gifts

2865
03:25:27,440 --> 03:25:29,280
to move the slider towards the gift icon.

2866
03:25:38,069 --> 03:25:38,709
What did you get me?

2867
03:25:39,430 --> 03:25:42,899
Oh, it's a will potion.

2868
03:25:44,420 --> 03:25:44,819
Thank you.

2869
03:25:47,860 --> 03:25:49,059
I got you this gift.

2870
03:25:49,059 --> 03:25:49,700
Another one?

2871
03:25:55,479 --> 03:25:56,840
She's still drunk?

2872
03:25:56,840 --> 03:25:57,879
No, she's not.

2873
03:26:02,530 --> 03:26:03,729
Swap, what can we swap?

2874
03:26:05,319 --> 03:26:06,120
Oh, okay, whatever.

2875
03:26:09,620 --> 03:26:11,299
She's not still drunk.

2876
03:26:15,750 --> 03:26:16,790
All right, we're good.

2877
03:26:16,790 --> 03:26:19,559
Missed you.

2878
03:26:19,559 --> 03:26:20,440
Hello, darlings.

2879
03:26:25,780 --> 03:26:28,690
All right, all right.

2880
03:26:29,409 --> 03:26:31,719
You're the best.

2881
03:26:31,719 --> 03:26:33,399
Here, you want some...

2882
03:26:33,399 --> 03:26:34,120
You want a snack?

2883
03:26:36,100 --> 03:26:36,579
A boat?

2884
03:26:36,579 --> 03:26:41,159
Hey, uh, for some boots.

2885
03:26:41,639 --> 03:26:49,379
She's still following me around.

2886
03:26:49,940 --> 03:26:52,129
Who's this?

2887
03:26:52,850 --> 03:26:54,469
What do you want?

2888
03:26:54,469 --> 03:27:01,440
Are you clapping and saying nice to my wife?

2889
03:27:06,049 --> 03:27:07,649
What the fuck is happening right now?

2890
03:27:07,649 --> 03:27:08,450
Are you kidding me?

2891
03:27:14,879 --> 03:27:15,520
What?

2892
03:27:15,520 --> 03:27:21,110
She's drunk.

2893
03:27:41,110 --> 03:27:43,040
She was congratulating your marriage.

2894
03:27:43,840 --> 03:27:45,430
I know.

2895
03:27:45,430 --> 03:27:47,430
All right, time to celebrate with some pies.

2896
03:27:47,909 --> 03:27:50,799
Let us see what we can do.

2897
03:27:50,799 --> 03:27:52,719
Oh, nasty nuts.

2898
03:27:52,719 --> 03:27:53,520
Rotten apples.

2899
03:27:55,079 --> 03:27:56,520
Rancid apple pie.

2900
03:27:56,520 --> 03:27:57,719
Dude, whatever, I'll eat it.

2901
03:28:00,100 --> 03:28:01,299
Wait, man flesh?

2902
03:28:12,079 --> 03:28:13,200
Oh, I'm not eating one of these.

2903
03:28:13,760 --> 03:28:24,040
No, that means evil.

2904
03:28:24,760 --> 03:28:26,280
That makes you evil if you eat that.

2905
03:28:26,280 --> 03:28:32,659
I think we're ready for our love to get physical.

2906
03:28:32,659 --> 03:28:33,459
Really?

2907
03:28:33,459 --> 03:28:33,959
Yep.

2908
03:28:36,170 --> 03:28:38,329
You finally got rid of that headache, dear.

2909
03:28:39,690 --> 03:28:41,260
Let's go.

2910
03:28:48,139 --> 03:28:48,639
Let's go.

2911
03:28:49,020 --> 03:28:57,110
That guy's not going to come in here, right?

2912
03:29:06,739 --> 03:29:08,260
I just ate like three pies.

2913
03:29:13,100 --> 03:29:16,379
I imagine I have like blueberry stain all over my mouth.

2914
03:29:23,899 --> 03:29:24,299
What?

2915
03:29:24,299 --> 03:29:25,180
Already?

2916
03:29:25,180 --> 03:29:26,110
Ow.

2917
03:29:28,920 --> 03:29:30,040
I'm speed running this.

2918
03:29:42,870 --> 03:29:53,590
Okay, so now we have a kid.

2919
03:29:56,149 --> 03:29:57,430
I got speed boost.

2920
03:30:00,489 --> 03:30:02,780
Wait, is that because...

2921
03:30:04,280 --> 03:30:04,840
Never mind.

2922
03:30:07,059 --> 03:30:09,299
Congratulations on starting a family.

2923
03:30:10,250 --> 03:30:12,889
Entertain your newborn by facing the cot,

2924
03:30:12,889 --> 03:30:14,809
getting their attention with left trigger,

2925
03:30:16,069 --> 03:30:17,510
and performing expressions.

2926
03:30:17,510 --> 03:30:19,110
A happy family gives you better bonuses.

2927
03:30:19,670 --> 03:30:22,549
Find out more about your offspring and name them if you like

2928
03:30:22,549 --> 03:30:25,270
by holding the left trigger pressing Y to see the personality screen.

2929
03:30:27,219 --> 03:30:27,780
Oh, a present.

2930
03:30:32,420 --> 03:30:32,979
What'd you get me?

2931
03:30:37,780 --> 03:30:38,180
What?

2932
03:30:38,180 --> 03:30:39,059
You got me a quest?

2933
03:30:43,379 --> 03:30:44,100
Oh, thank you.

2934
03:30:46,440 --> 03:30:47,239
Well, give it to me.

2935
03:30:47,239 --> 03:30:47,639
I want it.

2936
03:30:48,360 --> 03:30:50,760
Ooh, will potion.

2937
03:30:50,760 --> 03:30:51,079
Thank you.

2938
03:30:51,719 --> 03:30:52,360
Where's the baby?

2939
03:30:54,139 --> 03:30:54,860
Hello, baby.

2940
03:30:55,500 --> 03:31:00,659
This is Gwyneth the farmer.

2941
03:31:00,659 --> 03:31:04,170
Wait, is this a baby?

2942
03:31:05,129 --> 03:31:05,690
Wait, what?

2943
03:31:07,030 --> 03:31:07,590
No, it's not.

2944
03:31:07,590 --> 03:31:08,229
This is the baby.

2945
03:31:08,790 --> 03:31:10,250
How do I talk to the baby?

2946
03:31:13,610 --> 03:31:15,129
Likes beef jerky.

2947
03:31:18,600 --> 03:31:20,120
I kind of like Kiernan.

2948
03:31:21,829 --> 03:31:23,110
Likes beef jerky.

2949
03:31:23,110 --> 03:31:27,370
I don't think it's supposed to feed beef jerky to a baby

2950
03:31:27,370 --> 03:31:29,079
and loves toy boat.

2951
03:31:29,079 --> 03:31:30,280
All right, victory arm pump.

2952
03:31:30,280 --> 03:31:31,000
You got it.

2953
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:40,299
Baby loves this move.

2954
03:31:40,299 --> 03:31:40,799
Yeah.

2955
03:31:47,479 --> 03:31:58,899
Oh, baby loves the arm pump.

2956
03:31:58,899 --> 03:31:59,860
Scream at the baby.

2957
03:32:01,690 --> 03:32:03,770
I don't think you can scream at the baby.

2958
03:32:03,770 --> 03:32:06,500
Wait, you can.

2959
03:32:11,209 --> 03:32:12,329
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

2960
03:32:12,329 --> 03:32:12,729
I'm sorry.

2961
03:32:12,729 --> 03:32:13,290
Remember this?

2962
03:32:17,639 --> 03:32:18,280
Oh, God.

2963
03:32:18,680 --> 03:32:19,319
Everything's okay.

2964
03:32:19,319 --> 03:32:19,879
Everything's okay.

2965
03:32:28,569 --> 03:32:29,290
No, sorry.

2966
03:32:29,290 --> 03:32:32,489
I am not going to vortex the baby.

2967
03:32:46,469 --> 03:32:46,790
All right.

2968
03:32:47,909 --> 03:32:53,459
I love how he's scary.

2969
03:32:53,459 --> 03:32:53,959
Whoa.

2970
03:32:54,659 --> 03:33:00,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2971
03:33:00,420 --> 03:33:01,379
Does the baby like farts?

2972
03:33:15,850 --> 03:33:16,889
You like to dance, baby?

2973
03:33:26,020 --> 03:33:26,340
All right.

2974
03:33:26,340 --> 03:33:29,459
So is this the part that we all have to come to terms with?

2975
03:33:29,459 --> 03:33:32,139
I probably ain't ever coming back here.

2976
03:33:32,139 --> 03:33:34,409
I'm going to forget where this house is.

2977
03:33:34,409 --> 03:33:38,409
So this is like all the only time I'm probably going to be here.

2978
03:33:38,409 --> 03:33:39,770
What happened?

2979
03:33:45,239 --> 03:33:46,840
Turn safety on, please.

2980
03:33:51,430 --> 03:33:53,510
Can I beg for money from the baby?

2981
03:33:53,510 --> 03:34:07,270
What about dog?

2982
03:34:07,270 --> 03:34:11,879
Come on, baby.

2983
03:34:11,879 --> 03:34:12,600
I need some cash.

2984
03:34:14,549 --> 03:34:14,950
Something.

2985
03:34:14,950 --> 03:34:31,110
Anything.

2986
03:34:31,110 --> 03:34:31,590
We're fine.

2987
03:34:31,590 --> 03:34:31,829
All right.

2988
03:34:31,829 --> 03:34:32,790
More info.

2989
03:34:32,790 --> 03:34:35,610
The baby thinks I'm ugly.

2990
03:34:37,049 --> 03:34:37,209
Okay.

2991
03:34:37,209 --> 03:34:38,809
We need to get beef jerky.

2992
03:34:38,809 --> 03:34:41,000
All right.

2993
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:42,280
Let's give a gift to the baby.

2994
03:34:42,280 --> 03:34:43,319
And I'm going to leave.

2995
03:34:43,319 --> 03:34:45,079
What is this?

2996
03:34:45,079 --> 03:34:46,549
Quests.

2997
03:34:46,549 --> 03:34:47,190
Families.

2998
03:34:47,190 --> 03:34:47,829
Wait, what do you mean?

2999
03:34:47,829 --> 03:34:49,190
Families, plural.

3000
03:34:49,190 --> 03:34:54,420
Family has a gift for you.

3001
03:34:54,420 --> 03:34:55,059
They do?

3002
03:34:55,059 --> 03:34:57,139
Who's got a gift?

3003
03:35:04,809 --> 03:35:05,290
Let's see it.

3004
03:35:17,590 --> 03:35:18,969
All right.

3005
03:35:18,969 --> 03:35:20,090
What does the baby want?

3006
03:35:20,090 --> 03:35:22,729
Some beef jerky, right?

3007
03:35:29,079 --> 03:35:31,000
I mean, I buy all the expired food.

3008
03:35:31,000 --> 03:35:31,319
I don't care.

3009
03:35:31,319 --> 03:35:31,879
I want to get huge.

3010
03:35:37,989 --> 03:35:43,450
How fat can you actually get in the game?

3011
03:35:47,899 --> 03:35:50,200
Feed the baby the flesh pie.

3012
03:35:51,270 --> 03:35:52,950
Well, you're crazy.

3013
03:35:52,950 --> 03:35:57,670
No, I don't think I'm not gaining any weight.

3014
03:35:57,670 --> 03:36:00,040
Look at the log book.

3015
03:36:00,680 --> 03:36:03,819
Yeah, I'm as fat as you can be.

3016
03:36:05,500 --> 03:36:11,620
Good.

3017
03:36:11,620 --> 03:36:11,860
Okay.

3018
03:36:11,860 --> 03:36:13,299
Look, I'm good and I'm pure.

3019
03:36:14,100 --> 03:36:15,639
My renown is good.

3020
03:36:17,989 --> 03:36:19,270
My attractiveness is okay.

3021
03:36:19,989 --> 03:36:22,409
Where's my fat skill?

3022
03:36:31,750 --> 03:36:33,190
Where's fatness?

3023
03:36:34,069 --> 03:36:35,030
Minus 26.

3024
03:36:35,030 --> 03:36:35,909
It can be more than that.

3025
03:36:36,629 --> 03:36:45,100
It can definitely be more than that.

3026
03:36:50,340 --> 03:36:57,819
What's the fattiest thing in the whole game?

3027
03:36:58,620 --> 03:37:07,159
Level 26 fat guy.

3028
03:37:14,739 --> 03:37:14,979
Five.

3029
03:37:15,700 --> 03:37:16,020
Ten.

3030
03:37:16,020 --> 03:37:17,379
Oh no, it is working, isn't it?

3031
03:37:18,020 --> 03:37:18,659
Yeah, it's working.

3032
03:37:19,219 --> 03:37:22,739
Minus 30 is the lowest you can go.

3033
03:37:22,739 --> 03:37:22,979
All right.

3034
03:37:22,979 --> 03:37:23,860
Well, it's probably there now.

3035
03:37:31,260 --> 03:37:31,500
All right.

3036
03:37:31,500 --> 03:37:32,139
Let's keep going.

3037
03:37:32,780 --> 03:37:34,200
Let's do the quest.

3038
03:37:34,840 --> 03:37:42,059
Move close so we can see.

3039
03:37:42,780 --> 03:37:44,500
No, I like this outfit.

3040
03:37:44,500 --> 03:37:45,139
I'm keeping it on.

3041
03:37:45,780 --> 03:37:48,569
Drink the EXP potions.

3042
03:37:48,569 --> 03:37:49,930
That's a great idea.

3043
03:37:49,930 --> 03:37:52,979
All right.

3044
03:37:52,979 --> 03:37:53,940
This is Will potion.

3045
03:37:55,340 --> 03:37:55,819
Oh yeah.

3046
03:38:07,530 --> 03:38:08,329
Strength one, two.

3047
03:38:09,049 --> 03:38:13,299
Okay.

3048
03:38:13,299 --> 03:38:15,860
I've got enough experience now to do what?

3049
03:38:18,120 --> 03:38:19,799
I do physique.

3050
03:38:20,600 --> 03:38:21,620
It's just more damage.

3051
03:38:21,620 --> 03:38:22,340
What about tough now?

3052
03:38:22,340 --> 03:38:22,659
Let me do...

3053
03:38:23,780 --> 03:38:25,879
Yeah, I'll do physique.

3054
03:38:25,879 --> 03:38:27,590
More damage.

3055
03:38:27,590 --> 03:38:28,149
Let's go to Will.

3056
03:38:28,709 --> 03:38:30,360
All right.

3057
03:38:30,360 --> 03:38:32,040
I don't have enough to do very much anything.

3058
03:38:37,770 --> 03:38:38,889
14,000.

3059
03:38:38,889 --> 03:38:39,290
Jesus.

3060
03:38:40,489 --> 03:38:42,090
I should do shock too.

3061
03:38:48,760 --> 03:38:49,959
Time control sounds cool.

3062
03:38:49,959 --> 03:38:50,520
Yeah, it does.

3063
03:38:51,479 --> 03:38:51,879
All right.

3064
03:38:53,559 --> 03:38:54,760
What is it, honey?

3065
03:38:59,260 --> 03:38:59,579
Yeah.

3066
03:38:59,579 --> 03:39:01,020
You see how many fist pumps I did?

3067
03:39:01,829 --> 03:39:01,989
Here.

3068
03:39:01,989 --> 03:39:02,549
Do you want something?

3069
03:39:02,549 --> 03:39:02,790
Here.

3070
03:39:02,790 --> 03:39:02,950
Take...

3071
03:39:04,889 --> 03:39:05,049
Take...

3072
03:39:06,090 --> 03:39:07,079
Here.

3073
03:39:07,079 --> 03:39:07,959
Have a piece of chocolate.

3074
03:39:08,520 --> 03:39:13,909
All right.

3075
03:39:13,909 --> 03:39:14,870
What does it want me to do in here?

3076
03:39:15,590 --> 03:39:19,270
What do you want me to do in here?

3077
03:39:19,829 --> 03:39:21,799
I got to change the quest.

3078
03:39:24,280 --> 03:39:24,680
Okay.

3079
03:39:24,680 --> 03:39:25,319
I'm going to do...

3080
03:39:26,120 --> 03:39:27,639
Talk to the abbot in Oakfield.

3081
03:39:29,719 --> 03:39:30,280
Sculptor.

3082
03:39:30,840 --> 03:39:33,479
Let's do the...

3083
03:39:34,280 --> 03:39:34,760
Sculptor.

3084
03:39:34,760 --> 03:39:35,000
Yeah.

3085
03:39:47,379 --> 03:39:48,260
Oh, weapons guy.

3086
03:39:52,360 --> 03:39:52,920
What do you got?

3087
03:39:53,479 --> 03:39:55,590
How much money?

3088
03:39:55,590 --> 03:39:56,389
I got 4,500.

3089
03:39:57,190 --> 03:39:57,829
Iron axe.

3090
03:39:58,469 --> 03:40:00,340
That's pretty good.

3091
03:40:00,340 --> 03:40:01,379
Iron blunderbuss.

3092
03:40:01,379 --> 03:40:01,620
Ooh.

3093
03:40:03,209 --> 03:40:04,489
Steel axe.

3094
03:40:04,489 --> 03:40:05,989
Can I take it?

3095
03:40:06,549 --> 03:40:08,889
Give me the gun.

3096
03:40:16,200 --> 03:40:16,920
And give me the...

3097
03:40:17,959 --> 03:40:22,809
Iron axe.

3098
03:40:24,250 --> 03:40:27,940
You're paying top gold for top quality items.

3099
03:40:27,940 --> 03:40:28,340
Here we go.

3100
03:40:28,340 --> 03:40:28,500
All right.

3101
03:40:28,500 --> 03:40:30,780
Let's take a look at it.

3102
03:40:30,780 --> 03:40:31,579
And a clothing trader.

3103
03:40:31,579 --> 03:40:32,219
What do you got?

3104
03:40:32,219 --> 03:40:35,239
We have some new things in stock, you might ask.

3105
03:40:35,239 --> 03:40:36,200
Condom.

3106
03:40:36,200 --> 03:40:36,440
No.

3107
03:40:37,610 --> 03:40:38,409
Autograph card.

3108
03:40:38,409 --> 03:40:39,450
Ah, that item is discounted.

3109
03:40:39,450 --> 03:40:40,680
Yeah.

3110
03:40:40,680 --> 03:40:41,879
I'll take a couple of these.

3111
03:40:41,879 --> 03:40:43,799
You've bought a fine item.

3112
03:40:43,799 --> 03:40:44,360
Dog treats.

3113
03:40:44,360 --> 03:40:44,680
Yep.

3114
03:40:47,260 --> 03:40:49,020
You've bought a fine item.

3115
03:40:49,020 --> 03:40:49,819
Wedding bells.

3116
03:40:50,620 --> 03:40:51,899
Sheep flowers.

3117
03:40:51,899 --> 03:40:52,059
Yeah.

3118
03:40:52,059 --> 03:40:53,180
Just get a bunch of random gifts.

3119
03:40:53,180 --> 03:40:55,260
I hope it brings you great happiness.

3120
03:40:56,379 --> 03:40:58,299
You've bought a fine item.

3121
03:40:58,940 --> 03:41:03,059
Oh, I like this.

3122
03:41:03,860 --> 03:41:04,979
Is this a hat?

3123
03:41:04,979 --> 03:41:06,020
It's on sale.

3124
03:41:06,020 --> 03:41:07,940
Oh, bargain.

3125
03:41:07,940 --> 03:41:13,670
I like this.

3126
03:41:15,510 --> 03:41:18,149
You're making a great saving on that.

3127
03:41:18,709 --> 03:41:22,299
Rock bottom prizes for rock bottom times.

3128
03:41:23,260 --> 03:41:23,579
Okay.

3129
03:41:29,799 --> 03:41:36,860
This looks like I had to become a superhero really quickly.

3130
03:41:36,860 --> 03:41:39,780
And I just kind of threw on everything I could find

3131
03:41:39,780 --> 03:41:50,780
in like the closet for everybody that lives in my house.

3132
03:41:50,780 --> 03:41:51,020
All right.

3133
03:41:51,020 --> 03:41:55,979
Let's do it.

3134
03:41:55,979 --> 03:41:57,020
Model for the sculpture.

3135
03:41:57,020 --> 03:41:57,500
Yes.

3136
03:41:57,500 --> 03:41:59,180
Let me take a good look at you.

3137
03:41:59,180 --> 03:42:02,729
Perform and hold an expression.

3138
03:42:02,729 --> 03:42:04,010
Well, I mean, we kind of have to.

3139
03:42:17,209 --> 03:42:18,170
Wait, am I supposed to hold it?

3140
03:42:33,959 --> 03:42:34,760
Keep farting.

3141
03:42:42,659 --> 03:42:44,500
Hey, I got to get out of there.

3142
03:42:49,879 --> 03:42:56,680
Oh, wait, I didn't win.

3143
03:42:58,940 --> 03:43:00,059
Did I win?

3144
03:43:00,860 --> 03:43:05,139
I hope it's me grabbing my butt.

3145
03:43:24,389 --> 03:43:25,670
This is going to get me in trouble.

3146
03:43:26,389 --> 03:43:27,670
I'm going to shock somebody in the face.

3147
03:43:27,670 --> 03:43:29,030
It's going to get me in a lot of trouble.

3148
03:43:36,819 --> 03:43:37,379
Oh, cool.

3149
03:43:37,379 --> 03:43:37,780
All right.

3150
03:43:37,780 --> 03:43:38,500
Nice.

3151
03:43:38,500 --> 03:43:43,500
What's next on the quest?

3152
03:43:43,500 --> 03:43:43,819
All right.

3153
03:43:43,819 --> 03:43:44,459
The ritual.

3154
03:43:44,459 --> 03:43:44,860
Let's go.

3155
03:43:52,459 --> 03:43:53,420
All right, dog.

3156
03:43:53,420 --> 03:43:56,500
Let's go.

3157
03:43:56,500 --> 03:44:00,489
The demon door over here.

3158
03:44:01,219 --> 03:44:02,100
Oh, yeah, I remember those.

3159
03:44:02,100 --> 03:44:04,500
It's like you have to do certain things in front of it.

3160
03:44:05,219 --> 03:44:06,020
Oh, yes.

3161
03:44:06,659 --> 03:44:08,260
You must be fat.

3162
03:44:08,260 --> 03:44:09,540
You must be strong.

3163
03:44:09,540 --> 03:44:10,899
You must be wise.

3164
03:44:11,700 --> 03:44:13,219
I forgot about demon doors.

3165
03:44:13,219 --> 03:44:22,889
Where is it?

3166
03:44:22,889 --> 03:44:36,340
Yeah, the demon doors were the coolest part of the whole game.

3167
03:44:36,340 --> 03:44:37,700
They were everywhere in the first game.

3168
03:44:40,379 --> 03:44:49,049
Where are they in this one?

3169
03:44:49,049 --> 03:44:49,690
Demon door.

3170
03:44:49,690 --> 03:44:53,319
Come on.

3171
03:44:54,200 --> 03:45:00,299
Usually on the side of a rock, like clip, right?

3172
03:45:00,299 --> 03:45:01,420
Like something I can hear.

3173
03:45:01,420 --> 03:45:09,690
Honestly, the demon door was probably the coolest concept.

3174
03:45:09,690 --> 03:45:15,159
I'm surprised nobody else decided to just take it and make a bunch of stuff.

3175
03:45:15,159 --> 03:45:18,200
Make a game based around demon doors like Fable 1 was.

3176
03:45:18,200 --> 03:45:20,360
It was such a cool idea.

3177
03:45:20,360 --> 03:45:23,690
Follow the coast.

3178
03:45:27,879 --> 03:45:35,700
Yeah, because it forced you to play a certain way.

3179
03:45:35,700 --> 03:45:37,379
And if you didn't, here we go.

3180
03:45:37,379 --> 03:45:37,879
All right.

3181
03:45:53,079 --> 03:45:55,559
Oh, hello.

3182
03:45:55,559 --> 03:45:58,680
I wager you have never known a love truer.

3183
03:45:58,680 --> 03:45:59,319
I'm married.

3184
03:45:59,319 --> 03:46:00,120
Open the door, please.

3185
03:46:00,120 --> 03:46:09,059
The purest vibes of such love, even for just a few seconds, would inflate my soul with delight.

3186
03:46:09,059 --> 03:46:15,030
A delicate kiss between pledged lovers is all that I ask.

3187
03:46:15,670 --> 03:46:19,030
Such a sight would surely unlock my pain.

3188
03:46:19,030 --> 03:46:21,270
Okay.

3189
03:46:21,270 --> 03:46:21,590
All right.

3190
03:46:21,590 --> 03:46:24,250
Honey!

3191
03:46:24,250 --> 03:46:26,569
Honey, there's this weird thing in our backyard.

3192
03:46:26,569 --> 03:46:34,889
Where's our house?

3193
03:46:34,889 --> 03:46:43,450
My children speak of all great adventures, but they never utter your name.

3194
03:46:43,450 --> 03:46:43,850
Honey!

3195
03:46:44,409 --> 03:46:50,389
Follow me.

3196
03:46:50,389 --> 03:46:52,299
We have to open this door.

3197
03:46:52,299 --> 03:47:05,479
Where is she?

3198
03:47:05,479 --> 03:47:08,250
Where'd you go?

3199
03:47:08,250 --> 03:47:12,260
All right.

3200
03:47:12,260 --> 03:47:14,940
Honey, I need you to come with me for a minute.

3201
03:47:14,940 --> 03:47:15,340
All right.

3202
03:47:15,340 --> 03:47:16,059
Come with me.

3203
03:47:16,059 --> 03:47:23,930
Follow me, please.

3204
03:47:23,930 --> 03:47:26,149
Um, follow me.

3205
03:47:26,149 --> 03:47:30,549
Can I even kiss you?

3206
03:47:30,549 --> 03:47:34,069
I can't even kiss her.

3207
03:47:34,870 --> 03:47:37,399
How do I unlock kiss?

3208
03:47:37,959 --> 03:47:40,059
How do I kiss her?

3209
03:47:40,059 --> 03:47:44,020
How do I get the kiss expression?

3210
03:47:50,579 --> 03:47:51,829
What?

3211
03:47:51,829 --> 03:47:55,670
I have to go to the bookstore?

3212
03:47:55,670 --> 03:47:56,709
Oh, God.

3213
03:47:56,709 --> 03:47:57,030
Okay.

3214
03:47:57,030 --> 03:47:58,069
Well, just stay here then.

3215
03:47:58,629 --> 03:47:59,750
Remind me if this exists.

3216
03:48:12,840 --> 03:48:15,319
The time is very late.

3217
03:48:16,120 --> 03:48:16,760
Okay, let's go.

3218
03:48:17,319 --> 03:48:18,600
Remind me if that exists.

3219
03:48:18,600 --> 03:48:24,139
She doesn't even like you enough?

3220
03:48:24,860 --> 03:48:25,579
We're married.

3221
03:48:26,219 --> 03:48:44,149
It's a loveless marriage.

3222
03:48:51,959 --> 03:48:52,600
Oh.

3223
03:48:52,600 --> 03:48:53,829
Bandage.

3224
03:49:09,610 --> 03:49:15,750
I have two keys.

3225
03:49:15,750 --> 03:49:16,629
Minus 25.

3226
03:49:16,629 --> 03:49:17,989
Oh, for the house.

3227
03:49:23,909 --> 03:49:24,950
Temple of light.

3228
03:49:34,649 --> 03:49:35,129
Who are you?

3229
03:49:51,350 --> 03:49:55,270
The sacred texts clearly say that only two monks might enter the cave.

3230
03:49:55,270 --> 03:49:55,989
No one else.

3231
03:49:57,430 --> 03:50:00,469
I'll not send my only child into unknown dangers.

3232
03:50:02,549 --> 03:50:06,389
What do you need?

3233
03:50:07,030 --> 03:50:08,870
Hello there, my child.

3234
03:50:08,870 --> 03:50:11,590
I wonder.

3235
03:50:11,590 --> 03:50:12,629
Brothers, leave us.

3236
03:50:16,280 --> 03:50:22,340
Let me take a look at you for a moment.

3237
03:50:22,340 --> 03:50:24,020
Quite imposing.

3238
03:50:24,020 --> 03:50:26,020
But I can't send just anyone in there.

3239
03:50:28,500 --> 03:50:31,139
I suppose danger is not everyone's cup of tea.

3240
03:50:31,860 --> 03:50:33,909
You look imposing all right.

3241
03:50:33,909 --> 03:50:37,750
But I can't entrust our community's survival to a complete stranger.

3242
03:50:37,750 --> 03:50:38,229
Why not?

3243
03:50:38,950 --> 03:50:43,030
Perhaps if you built up a reputation, I'd be more inclined to trust you.

3244
03:50:44,309 --> 03:50:44,629
Yes.

3245
03:50:45,670 --> 03:50:48,870
Rookridge has been having a horrible time with bandits lately.

3246
03:50:50,069 --> 03:50:53,430
Why don't you go to the tavern and see if you can do anything about them?

3247
03:50:53,430 --> 03:50:54,709
That would be a good start.

3248
03:50:56,250 --> 03:50:58,969
The blessing must go forward if you're to find the pilgrim.

3249
03:50:59,610 --> 03:51:01,129
You must gain the abbot's favor.

3250
03:51:01,129 --> 03:51:02,010
Oh, fine.

3251
03:51:02,010 --> 03:51:04,489
Perhaps you can find a way to impress him in the town.

3252
03:51:04,489 --> 03:51:05,370
Impress him?

3253
03:51:05,370 --> 03:51:07,930
Use your map to see where quests and jobs are.

3254
03:51:07,930 --> 03:51:08,729
He has a quest.

3255
03:51:09,530 --> 03:51:14,340
A bridge too far.

3256
03:51:15,059 --> 03:51:17,219
Fight the bandits in Rookridge.

3257
03:51:17,219 --> 03:51:17,540
Sure.

3258
03:51:18,739 --> 03:51:31,459
I don't have to go up here.

3259
03:51:40,440 --> 03:51:41,879
Let me help you.

3260
03:51:41,879 --> 03:51:43,000
Can I help you?

3261
03:51:43,000 --> 03:51:45,059
You want a deed?

3262
03:51:45,059 --> 03:51:46,260
You want to get a deed back?

3263
03:51:46,260 --> 03:51:46,979
I can get a deed.

3264
03:51:50,659 --> 03:51:51,540
I got you want to get a deed?

3265
03:51:51,540 --> 03:51:51,940
I can get it.

3266
03:51:51,940 --> 03:51:52,500
You want to get the deed?

3267
03:51:52,500 --> 03:51:53,459
I can get the deed, man.

3268
03:51:53,459 --> 03:52:00,940
Bet your ass I will.

3269
03:52:04,950 --> 03:52:05,450
Mm-hmm.

3270
03:52:14,170 --> 03:52:15,129
Oh, I don't even need to...

3271
03:52:15,129 --> 03:52:17,209
Look, all you need to say is get rid of the people at this location.

3272
03:52:17,209 --> 03:52:21,000
That's all you need.

3273
03:52:21,000 --> 03:52:22,520
I don't need any other info, man.

3274
03:52:22,520 --> 03:52:25,879
I'm gonna go literally blow their heads off with a shotgun

3275
03:52:25,879 --> 03:52:28,280
and I'm gonna kill them with electricity and shit.

3276
03:52:28,280 --> 03:52:28,680
Just wait.

3277
03:52:28,680 --> 03:52:29,559
Don't worry.

3278
03:52:29,559 --> 03:52:30,120
I'm the hero.

3279
03:52:33,739 --> 03:52:35,020
Any Aaron chatters?

3280
03:52:35,739 --> 03:52:36,219
Probably.

3281
03:52:36,780 --> 03:52:37,899
Or your shit load of you.

3282
03:52:58,389 --> 03:52:58,950
Okay.

3283
03:52:58,950 --> 03:52:59,590
Bandits.

3284
03:52:59,590 --> 03:53:00,309
Let's go.

3285
03:53:00,309 --> 03:53:10,069
You didn't say it in the funny voice?

3286
03:53:11,030 --> 03:53:13,850
No, that wasn't even the right one.

3287
03:53:13,850 --> 03:53:14,409
Aaron!

3288
03:53:14,409 --> 03:53:14,909
There you go.

3289
03:53:15,770 --> 03:53:16,969
You get that like once a week.

3290
03:53:22,950 --> 03:53:23,590
Any treasure?

3291
03:53:23,590 --> 03:53:24,389
Nope.

3292
03:53:24,389 --> 03:53:25,590
All right, what's on my bar right now?

3293
03:53:27,399 --> 03:53:27,959
Vortex.

3294
03:53:27,959 --> 03:53:29,079
Yeah, you better believe it.

3295
03:53:29,639 --> 03:53:31,899
Vortex into shotgun.

3296
03:53:31,899 --> 03:53:39,110
Tell the boss?

3297
03:53:39,750 --> 03:53:44,309
All right, let's go kick some fucking butt.

3298
03:53:55,430 --> 03:53:58,709
Bring back Super Frog.

3299
03:53:58,709 --> 03:53:59,510
I love Super Frog.

3300
03:53:59,510 --> 03:54:00,549
It's like one of my favorite characters.

3301
03:54:05,020 --> 03:54:06,329
That's it?

3302
03:54:07,270 --> 03:54:07,750
Get him.

3303
03:54:09,479 --> 03:54:11,399
Okay, come on down the stairs then.

3304
03:54:18,899 --> 03:54:20,020
Let's make a tornado.

3305
03:54:28,440 --> 03:54:29,559
This is slow motion.

3306
03:54:39,319 --> 03:54:39,959
How?

3307
03:54:39,959 --> 03:54:52,709
Don't even use the weapon.

3308
03:54:52,709 --> 03:54:54,069
What's the point of using the weapon?

3309
03:54:54,069 --> 03:55:04,569
Oh, that's purple.

3310
03:55:04,569 --> 03:55:05,370
That's beautiful.

3311
03:55:05,370 --> 03:55:06,010
That's awesome.

3312
03:55:06,729 --> 03:55:10,250
That's just shit.

3313
03:55:10,250 --> 03:55:11,129
Fly him around.

3314
03:55:11,129 --> 03:55:11,629
Zapper.

3315
03:55:12,659 --> 03:55:13,159
Shotgun.

3316
03:55:27,770 --> 03:55:28,569
I love this voice.

3317
03:55:40,149 --> 03:55:41,030
I love this guy.

3318
03:55:59,370 --> 03:56:00,010
Come on, boy.

3319
03:56:09,479 --> 03:56:10,920
His voice is so wild.

3320
03:56:10,920 --> 03:56:11,420
I love it.

3321
03:56:11,959 --> 03:56:17,030
I've never heard that guy before.

3322
03:56:17,030 --> 03:56:17,829
What the fuck?

3323
03:56:18,629 --> 03:56:28,170
And Vortex is pretty helpful.

3324
03:56:28,170 --> 03:56:45,399
I'm just eating.

3325
03:56:45,399 --> 03:56:58,420
He's in a- this guy's in a lot of TV shows.

3326
03:56:58,420 --> 03:57:04,549
Really?

3327
03:57:04,549 --> 03:57:06,309
When is he going to kill the baby?

3328
03:57:07,450 --> 03:57:11,500
I know most of you are probably only still on this stream.

3329
03:57:11,500 --> 03:57:12,620
You're only probably still here.

3330
03:57:13,860 --> 03:57:17,219
Because you are thinking at some point I'm going to have safety off

3331
03:57:17,219 --> 03:57:18,500
and I'm going to kill the baby.

3332
03:57:19,659 --> 03:57:22,940
I- I think that's why a bunch of you are still here.

3333
03:57:22,940 --> 03:57:26,819
Because you don't want to miss when like the guy kills the baby.

3334
03:57:26,819 --> 03:57:27,559
You know what I mean?

3335
03:57:27,559 --> 03:57:29,159
Like, it's not going to happen though.

3336
03:57:29,159 --> 03:57:41,450
I'm just- I'm not happening.

3337
03:57:41,450 --> 03:57:43,610
Like, I really doubt that's going to happen.

3338
03:57:43,610 --> 03:57:53,579
Why do you think they call me Dash?

3339
03:57:54,219 --> 03:57:56,139
I'll be a moil away from you before you-

3340
03:57:57,739 --> 03:58:18,010
He'll die already.

3341
03:58:18,010 --> 03:58:19,690
Ow.

3342
03:58:19,690 --> 03:58:30,700
Is he dead?

3343
03:58:30,700 --> 03:58:36,500
Thank god that guy took so many hits.

3344
03:58:36,500 --> 03:58:42,840
Imagine getting your ass kicked by a guy that looks like this.

3345
03:58:43,559 --> 03:58:49,239
I mean, this- if anybody's shooting lightning out of their hands.

3346
03:58:58,489 --> 03:59:01,690
Whoa.

3347
03:59:02,409 --> 03:59:04,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3348
03:59:04,170 --> 03:59:08,360
It's in the fucking tornado.

3349
03:59:08,360 --> 03:59:08,760
Let's go.

3350
03:59:09,559 --> 03:59:27,049
Heal the dog?

3351
03:59:27,049 --> 03:59:27,530
I'll get it.

3352
03:59:27,530 --> 03:59:28,250
I'll get the dog.

3353
03:59:28,250 --> 03:59:28,489
All right.

3354
03:59:28,489 --> 03:59:35,450
Come here, dog.

3355
03:59:35,450 --> 03:59:36,729
I have a dog treat for you, right?

3356
03:59:36,729 --> 03:59:37,530
Come here.

3357
03:59:37,530 --> 03:59:39,059
How do I do it?

3358
03:59:39,059 --> 03:59:40,620
Can I not do it?

3359
03:59:40,620 --> 03:59:41,579
Use dog elixir.

3360
03:59:41,579 --> 03:59:42,860
I don't have a dog elixir, do I?

3361
03:59:43,420 --> 03:59:53,899
It says feed and kill the bandit dog.

3362
03:59:56,020 --> 03:59:56,659
What the fuck?

3363
03:59:56,659 --> 04:00:00,809
All right.

3364
04:00:00,809 --> 04:00:02,010
I want shock too.

3365
04:00:02,819 --> 04:00:05,370
Yep.

3366
04:00:05,370 --> 04:00:06,969
I had to spend all my money but I want it.

3367
04:00:09,639 --> 04:00:10,840
How about speed?

3368
04:00:11,899 --> 04:00:12,459
Accuracy?

3369
04:00:13,180 --> 04:00:13,420
Yeah.

3370
04:00:20,520 --> 04:00:21,899
All right.

3371
04:00:21,899 --> 04:00:22,700
How much better is this?

3372
04:00:24,709 --> 04:00:25,909
So if I have level two.

3373
04:00:26,870 --> 04:00:29,399
All right.

3374
04:00:29,399 --> 04:00:30,600
So we're gonna have to change this, I think.

3375
04:00:31,159 --> 04:00:35,459
I want this to be lightning and we'll do-

3376
04:00:36,020 --> 04:00:37,139
Yeah, that- because that's kind of cool.

3377
04:00:37,139 --> 04:00:39,219
And then we get them with the thing and we just fucking zap them.

3378
04:00:39,860 --> 04:00:40,180
Perfect.

3379
04:00:40,180 --> 04:00:40,340
All right.

3380
04:00:40,340 --> 04:00:40,659
Let's go.

3381
04:00:41,299 --> 04:00:51,500
Oh, do you like this game?

3382
04:00:51,500 --> 04:00:51,739
Yeah.

3383
04:00:53,270 --> 04:00:54,229
It's keeping my attention.

3384
04:00:54,229 --> 04:00:54,709
It's funny.

3385
04:01:04,059 --> 04:01:05,659
Resurrection file.

3386
04:01:05,659 --> 04:01:08,649
Keep one of these in your inventory.

3387
04:01:08,649 --> 04:01:11,610
Should your health drop to zero, the resurrection file will automatically revive you.

3388
04:01:13,159 --> 04:01:14,520
Well, that's kind of a big deal.

3389
04:01:14,520 --> 04:01:14,840
All right.

3390
04:01:14,840 --> 04:01:15,159
Let's go.

3391
04:01:15,799 --> 04:01:18,250
It's a funny fart game.

3392
04:01:18,250 --> 04:01:19,129
Of course we like it.

3393
04:01:21,610 --> 04:01:25,110
I mean, that's the- I mean, that's how I keep you guys here.

3394
04:01:25,110 --> 04:01:26,709
Have you noticed that I've done a fart?

3395
04:01:26,709 --> 04:01:28,309
I've like farted into the microphone.

3396
04:01:30,709 --> 04:01:33,510
Like every maybe 30 minutes or so as it gets to keep you here.

3397
04:01:40,489 --> 04:01:42,170
Ooh, I like it.

3398
04:01:42,170 --> 04:01:42,569
It's good.

3399
04:01:43,370 --> 04:01:54,409
Where's my dog?

3400
04:01:54,409 --> 04:02:22,709
You can tell the health of the dog by the tail.

3401
04:02:22,709 --> 04:02:23,829
We would be here regardless.

3402
04:02:23,829 --> 04:02:26,379
Hey, that's- hey, thanks.

3403
04:02:26,379 --> 04:02:27,979
Would you- that's cool.

3404
04:02:27,979 --> 04:02:28,299
Thanks.

3405
04:02:30,899 --> 04:02:31,780
Oh, the dog's on him.

3406
04:02:38,059 --> 04:02:38,700
But I killed him?

3407
04:02:41,659 --> 04:02:42,299
What?

3408
04:02:42,299 --> 04:02:48,840
I guess I- I mean, I guess that death would kill him.

3409
04:02:56,200 --> 04:02:56,760
Oh, okay.

3410
04:02:59,739 --> 04:03:01,989
Whatever.

3411
04:03:01,989 --> 04:03:02,870
No boss fight.

3412
04:03:02,870 --> 04:03:03,590
I guess not.

3413
04:03:08,540 --> 04:03:09,180
100 bucks?

3414
04:03:10,309 --> 04:03:11,350
Bandit bandana?

3415
04:03:12,440 --> 04:03:13,159
Bandit shirt?

3416
04:03:13,799 --> 04:03:14,840
Bandit trousers?

3417
04:03:15,639 --> 04:03:17,100
I'll just sell this shit.

3418
04:03:17,100 --> 04:03:18,940
I don't want to get- I want to have like a big gown on.

3419
04:03:19,500 --> 04:03:25,270
I need a big like mage gown.

3420
04:03:25,270 --> 04:03:28,309
All right.

3421
04:03:28,309 --> 04:03:28,870
Well, that was good.

3422
04:03:28,870 --> 04:03:30,870
So now I go back and talk to that guy.

3423
04:03:31,430 --> 04:03:35,989
Okay.

3424
04:03:35,989 --> 04:03:37,690
Return to Bonham.

3425
04:03:37,690 --> 04:03:47,659
He killed him and took his clothes.

3426
04:03:48,299 --> 04:03:57,659
I pretended to like this game because my crush liked it.

3427
04:04:00,569 --> 04:04:08,700
Yeah, but it's really- it's not a bad game.

3428
04:04:08,700 --> 04:04:09,739
It's fun.

3429
04:04:09,739 --> 04:04:21,610
All right.

3430
04:04:21,610 --> 04:04:22,729
Hey, look what I did.

3431
04:04:23,290 --> 04:04:27,190
Hey, what do you like?

3432
04:04:27,190 --> 04:04:27,909
Yeah, what do you like?

3433
04:04:28,709 --> 04:04:30,629
I'm trying to hit triangle for more info.

3434
04:04:30,709 --> 04:04:31,750
I don't want to shoot the guy.

3435
04:04:33,590 --> 04:04:37,700
He likes- what do you want- he wants a gift?

3436
04:04:38,260 --> 04:04:43,079
Heroic pose, sock puppet, and shoulder length hair.

3437
04:04:43,079 --> 04:04:59,690
How do I- how do I get the present?

3438
04:04:59,690 --> 04:05:01,319
Does the guy have a present?

3439
04:05:10,540 --> 04:05:11,020
Scare him.

3440
04:05:14,889 --> 04:05:15,690
You have to scare him.

3441
04:05:26,010 --> 04:05:30,040
Ain't so I might, but I'll bounce back.

3442
04:05:30,040 --> 04:05:30,680
Always do.

3443
04:05:32,069 --> 04:05:35,190
Anyway, here's my trusty Thesaurus, as promised.

3444
04:05:35,190 --> 04:05:35,989
Thesaurus?

3445
04:05:35,989 --> 04:05:38,870
You never know when you'll be caught in a lexicological quandary.

3446
04:05:38,870 --> 04:05:40,149
Doesn't tell me how to kiss.

3447
04:05:40,149 --> 04:05:49,979
You got 250 renown, dashes, goggles, and Barnum's Thesaurus.

3448
04:05:50,540 --> 04:05:59,879
Thanks to you, the way to Bowerstone is now open again.

3449
04:05:59,879 --> 04:06:00,920
The archaeologist?

3450
04:06:00,920 --> 04:06:01,559
All right, hold on.

3451
04:06:02,360 --> 04:06:03,319
I'm gonna scare this guy?

3452
04:06:06,920 --> 04:06:07,959
You've done it.

3453
04:06:07,959 --> 04:06:10,120
Almost everyone in Oakfield has heard of you.

3454
04:06:10,120 --> 04:06:10,840
Just slap him?

3455
04:06:12,729 --> 04:06:14,409
Now you can go- did I- I missed?

3456
04:06:14,409 --> 04:06:17,129
What I- I'm trying to do this- the thing on the left is changing.

3457
04:06:45,379 --> 04:06:51,860
Okay, we're almost there.

3458
04:06:56,250 --> 04:06:57,209
All right, now give me a present.

3459
04:06:59,700 --> 04:07:00,340
Give me a present.

3460
04:07:00,979 --> 04:07:02,979
He's re- give me the present.

3461
04:07:03,780 --> 04:07:15,020
Okay, so give me a present.

3462
04:07:15,020 --> 04:07:15,819
I'm on the present.

3463
04:07:23,879 --> 04:07:24,600
A little bit more?

3464
04:07:28,520 --> 04:07:32,620
A little more.

3465
04:07:34,200 --> 04:07:35,799
You trying to give me a heart attack?

3466
04:07:42,100 --> 04:07:42,819
Oh, accept gift.

3467
04:07:42,819 --> 04:07:43,540
There it is.

3468
04:07:43,540 --> 04:07:46,229
Just give me $71.

3469
04:07:47,750 --> 04:07:48,950
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy!

3470
04:07:51,829 --> 04:07:56,100
Thanks for cheering me up.

3471
04:08:13,430 --> 04:08:15,030
I love this one.

3472
04:08:15,030 --> 04:08:16,629
All right, um, let's go.

3473
04:08:16,629 --> 04:08:22,170
I just- oh, I so badly want to throw a tornado in there.

3474
04:08:22,729 --> 04:08:23,290
You know what I mean?

3475
04:08:23,290 --> 04:08:24,729
I just want to throw a tornado in there.

3476
04:08:30,219 --> 04:08:30,940
Any new clothing?

3477
04:08:34,709 --> 04:08:35,590
Wait, I am gonna sell.

3478
04:08:37,510 --> 04:08:41,290
I'm gonna sell the, um, another bandit shit I don't want.

3479
04:08:41,850 --> 04:08:44,819
Bandit shirt.

3480
04:08:44,819 --> 04:08:45,540
I don't want this.

3481
04:08:46,790 --> 04:08:47,829
Bandit trousers.

3482
04:08:47,829 --> 04:08:48,309
Don't want it.

3483
04:08:52,950 --> 04:08:58,389
You know what I mean?

3484
04:08:58,389 --> 04:08:58,950
I know.

3485
04:08:58,950 --> 04:08:59,590
I said that a lot.

3486
04:08:59,590 --> 04:08:59,829
I know.

3487
04:09:01,989 --> 04:09:05,049
All right, do I have enough renown to do what this guy wants me to do?

3488
04:09:05,690 --> 04:09:10,090
Will death do us part?

3489
04:09:10,090 --> 04:09:14,170
Speak to the ghost of a jilted lover and become the- its instrument of vengeance?

3490
04:09:14,889 --> 04:09:21,030
What do I mean in looking for a new model?

3491
04:09:23,860 --> 04:09:27,690
The statue's in front of the inn?

3492
04:09:27,690 --> 04:09:27,930
Oh.

3493
04:09:28,809 --> 04:09:29,770
Well, I'll do this and come back.

3494
04:09:45,209 --> 04:09:46,010
All right.

3495
04:09:46,010 --> 04:09:48,149
Oh, that's right.

3496
04:09:48,149 --> 04:09:50,389
I gotta go back to the blacksmith and do better blacksmithing.

3497
04:09:50,950 --> 04:09:54,389
I need to buy another house.

3498
04:09:58,680 --> 04:10:07,510
Later.

3499
04:10:07,510 --> 04:10:12,780
I'll let him get the jump on me.

3500
04:10:12,780 --> 04:10:13,100
Come on.

3501
04:10:13,819 --> 04:10:16,780
Get in the head.

3502
04:10:16,780 --> 04:10:23,770
I can now afford speed.

3503
04:10:24,649 --> 04:10:25,850
Not yet, though.

3504
04:10:25,850 --> 04:10:32,409
Just want to let you know, I bet my house on whether you're gonna die to the bandits in 30 minutes.

3505
04:10:32,969 --> 04:10:33,290
Please.

3506
04:10:33,290 --> 04:10:34,729
Well, it's been four and a half hours, man.

3507
04:10:35,370 --> 04:10:36,729
I don't think I'm gonna die to the bandits.

3508
04:10:46,709 --> 04:10:47,190
I am.

3509
04:10:47,989 --> 04:10:49,700
Glad of you to notice.

3510
04:11:03,180 --> 04:11:04,219
Oh, good shot.

3511
04:11:04,780 --> 04:11:05,979
Uh-oh.

3512
04:11:05,979 --> 04:11:10,170
All right.

3513
04:11:10,170 --> 04:11:10,729
I gotta run.

3514
04:11:10,729 --> 04:11:11,370
I gotta get up there.

3515
04:11:17,379 --> 04:11:18,500
Hey, why are you roleplaying?

3516
04:11:19,139 --> 04:11:27,420
I can't pretend like I'm in the game and just be like, oh, gotcha.

3517
04:11:27,979 --> 04:11:28,700
Sit down.

3518
04:11:28,700 --> 04:11:29,260
Why not?

3519
04:11:29,260 --> 04:11:30,139
I do this shit all the time.

3520
04:11:30,139 --> 04:11:31,739
Even when I'm not falling off.

3521
04:11:31,739 --> 04:11:32,979
Makes it more interesting.

3522
04:11:39,530 --> 04:11:40,090
E3.

3523
04:11:41,829 --> 04:11:44,870
You know, I still can't figure out the life of me.

3524
04:11:46,020 --> 04:11:46,979
Why they do that?

3525
04:11:47,780 --> 04:11:48,819
Why do they do that?

3526
04:11:51,879 --> 04:11:55,159
Have they ever played a video game before?

3527
04:11:55,159 --> 04:12:00,120
Why do they do the pretend actor wearing a vent call thing?

3528
04:12:01,639 --> 04:12:02,760
Nobody talks like that.

3529
04:12:05,510 --> 04:12:07,750
We all have played a shitload of games together.

3530
04:12:07,750 --> 04:12:14,250
We've played games in parties, online, even in just random lobbies.

3531
04:12:14,250 --> 04:12:15,770
People don't do that.

3532
04:12:15,770 --> 04:12:16,809
No one has ever...

3533
04:12:16,809 --> 04:12:20,409
I don't think the people making that have ever played a video game online.

3534
04:12:20,969 --> 04:12:30,260
But I mean, what's the alternative?

3535
04:12:30,899 --> 04:12:35,079
The alternative is, I guess, how it would really be.

3536
04:12:35,719 --> 04:12:38,840
Which would be turn your volume down really low

3537
04:12:38,840 --> 04:12:42,040
because somebody's going to have a horrible microphone and scream into it.

3538
04:12:42,040 --> 04:12:43,799
You're going to hear somebody get yelled at by their mother.

3539
04:12:44,520 --> 04:12:48,940
You're going to get like the lapel microphone sounds.

3540
04:12:48,940 --> 04:12:55,209
That is the alternative.

3541
04:12:55,209 --> 04:12:59,670
And maybe every like two or three minutes you'll hear...

3542
04:13:00,819 --> 04:13:01,780
The fuck, dude.

3543
04:13:06,700 --> 04:13:07,979
Fucking help me.

3544
04:13:07,979 --> 04:13:08,780
Fucking idiot.

3545
04:13:11,909 --> 04:13:12,790
Fuck.

3546
04:13:12,790 --> 04:13:16,280
Is it?

3547
04:13:16,280 --> 04:13:17,479
Or this.

3548
04:13:32,260 --> 04:13:33,059
What's more interesting?

3549
04:13:33,459 --> 04:13:33,940
Watch out.

3550
04:13:33,940 --> 04:13:34,659
Watch your six.

3551
04:13:35,219 --> 04:13:36,389
I'm right behind you.

3552
04:13:36,389 --> 04:13:36,870
I got it.

3553
04:13:37,750 --> 04:13:38,549
Going to the alt?

3554
04:13:38,549 --> 04:13:39,590
I sure am.

3555
04:13:39,590 --> 04:13:42,219
I guess that is kind of more interesting.

3556
04:13:50,219 --> 04:13:50,940
Oh, my statue.

3557
04:14:07,290 --> 04:14:09,610
Oh, it's a German 985 stream.

3558
04:14:10,250 --> 04:14:11,850
There's going to be a fat guy if it's possible.

3559
04:14:12,489 --> 04:14:15,899
Oh, my God.

3560
04:14:15,899 --> 04:14:16,700
Kubrick's there.

3561
04:14:41,450 --> 04:14:44,260
What happened?

3562
04:14:44,260 --> 04:14:46,180
The big day came and what?

3563
04:14:46,819 --> 04:14:52,200
All right, I'll help you.

3564
04:15:01,510 --> 04:15:02,549
Oh, I have a wife.

3565
04:15:04,629 --> 04:15:07,909
Then when she's ready to accept your proposal,

3566
04:15:07,909 --> 04:15:11,750
when she can't imagine her life without you, give her this.

3567
04:15:12,549 --> 04:15:15,180
Why don't I just like tell this guy to fuck off?

3568
04:15:15,180 --> 04:15:16,620
Rejection note?

3569
04:15:16,620 --> 04:15:18,139
Dear Alex, it's time for you to know the truth.

3570
04:15:18,139 --> 04:15:18,780
I don't love you.

3571
04:15:18,780 --> 04:15:19,420
I've never loved you.

3572
04:15:19,420 --> 04:15:20,379
This was all a game for me.

3573
04:15:20,379 --> 04:15:21,979
You are empty and deceitful,

3574
04:15:21,979 --> 04:15:24,540
and I hope you never find the slightest glimmer of happiness in this life.

3575
04:15:25,579 --> 04:15:31,530
I've spent a long time thinking of the exact right word,

3576
04:15:31,530 --> 04:15:33,690
and even longer getting it onto paper.

3577
04:15:34,170 --> 04:15:39,690
I am, which makes it all the more impressive that I managed to get this too.

3578
04:15:40,569 --> 04:15:41,209
Are you blue?

3579
04:15:43,299 --> 04:15:44,100
Wedding bells?

3580
04:15:47,850 --> 04:15:48,329
Oh, okay.

3581
04:15:48,809 --> 04:15:55,700
In case you need the help or no idea.

3582
04:15:55,700 --> 04:15:56,819
The art of seduction.

3583
04:15:59,670 --> 04:16:00,709
I have to read all these books.

3584
04:16:06,409 --> 04:16:06,729
Books.

3585
04:16:07,290 --> 04:16:08,540
The mage.

3586
04:16:09,180 --> 04:16:13,899
The mage follows where wisdom leads, but always into conflict.

3587
04:16:13,899 --> 04:16:16,459
Making an ally of this hero will cost you much.

3588
04:16:20,139 --> 04:16:20,700
The pilgrim.

3589
04:16:21,340 --> 04:16:21,979
The relic.

3590
04:16:21,979 --> 04:16:22,540
The thief.

3591
04:16:23,100 --> 04:16:24,299
The rejection note.

3592
04:16:24,299 --> 04:16:25,420
The temple of shadows.

3593
04:16:25,420 --> 04:16:25,899
The end.

3594
04:16:25,899 --> 04:16:26,219
Hold on.

3595
04:16:26,219 --> 04:16:26,940
Temple of shadows.

3596
04:16:27,500 --> 04:16:29,319
Can't read it?

3597
04:16:31,290 --> 04:16:31,690
Journal.

3598
04:16:31,690 --> 04:16:32,250
Wedding bells.

3599
04:16:32,250 --> 04:16:32,569
Read it.

3600
04:16:33,690 --> 04:16:34,569
Oakvale.

3601
04:16:34,569 --> 04:16:35,610
Thesaurus.

3602
04:16:35,610 --> 04:16:36,090
Seduction.

3603
04:16:36,809 --> 04:16:37,450
What did I just do?

3604
04:16:38,950 --> 04:16:39,590
Seduce.

3605
04:16:40,389 --> 04:16:46,520
All right, let's go seduce.

3606
04:16:46,520 --> 04:17:01,670
I think that was a really weird path that I just ran.

3607
04:17:02,309 --> 04:17:07,770
Trey the ghost?

3608
04:17:08,409 --> 04:17:11,610
We'll see.

3609
04:17:11,610 --> 04:17:12,329
We'll see what happens.

3610
04:17:20,500 --> 04:17:21,940
Thaustun.

3611
04:17:21,940 --> 04:17:28,700
Has he killed the baby yet?

3612
04:17:29,340 --> 04:17:33,799
You'll have to go.

3613
04:17:33,799 --> 04:17:34,440
You'll have to watch.

3614
04:17:40,229 --> 04:17:40,790
Fifteen.

3615
04:17:41,350 --> 04:17:42,469
Is that fifteen or five?

3616
04:17:45,459 --> 04:17:47,059
Wait, I have five silver keys?

3617
04:17:47,059 --> 04:17:48,260
When did I get five?

3618
04:17:48,260 --> 04:17:49,139
I thought I had like four.

3619
04:17:49,700 --> 04:17:51,450
Oh shit, nice.

3620
04:17:52,010 --> 04:17:59,049
All right, let's go seduce.

3621
04:17:59,850 --> 04:18:10,819
Here we go.

3622
04:18:11,459 --> 04:18:12,940
Where is Alex?

3623
04:18:18,860 --> 04:18:19,340
Who did that?

3624
04:18:19,340 --> 04:18:19,899
I didn't do that.

3625
04:18:20,620 --> 04:18:29,430
Get the kiss emote.

3626
04:18:29,430 --> 04:18:30,549
It's a book in this library.

3627
04:18:30,549 --> 04:18:33,239
Okay, I'll get it.

3628
04:18:33,879 --> 04:18:44,549
I feel like the breadcrumbs in this game were made for gamers like you.

3629
04:18:44,549 --> 04:18:45,030
They were.

3630
04:18:45,590 --> 04:18:46,629
I wish it was in every game.

3631
04:18:47,430 --> 04:18:54,790
What was that game where you could, if you pressed like down on the d-pad,

3632
04:18:54,790 --> 04:18:57,110
it was like and it did a little line on the ground.

3633
04:18:57,110 --> 04:18:57,670
Dead space.

3634
04:18:58,629 --> 04:19:00,469
Dead space is like the best game ever made.

3635
04:19:00,469 --> 04:19:04,569
You don't, you only use it when you need it.

3636
04:19:04,569 --> 04:19:09,510
It was awesome.

3637
04:19:09,510 --> 04:19:10,629
You never got lost.

3638
04:19:10,629 --> 04:19:11,270
It was perfect.

3639
04:19:11,270 --> 04:19:13,270
Oh, I want you to pay attention, gamer.

3640
04:19:13,270 --> 04:19:13,989
No, I don't care.

3641
04:19:13,989 --> 04:19:15,110
Just show me where to go.

3642
04:19:15,110 --> 04:19:20,149
All right.

3643
04:19:22,459 --> 04:19:23,739
Hi, I'm here to talk to you.

3644
04:19:33,510 --> 04:19:33,829
Hi.

3645
04:19:41,030 --> 04:19:43,049
Okay.

3646
04:19:55,370 --> 04:19:56,010
Wait, what?

3647
04:19:56,010 --> 04:19:56,649
Oh, gambling.

3648
04:19:56,649 --> 04:20:04,020
Hold on.

3649
04:20:04,020 --> 04:20:04,659
Keystone.

3650
04:20:06,899 --> 04:20:08,100
Oh, it's roulette.

3651
04:20:09,459 --> 04:20:16,760
I don't remember all this shit in this game.

3652
04:20:17,399 --> 04:20:25,860
I think I have an idea of how this works.

3653
04:20:26,579 --> 04:20:41,350
Okay, I want, let's go 15 inside bets.

3654
04:20:41,989 --> 04:20:47,930
Let's do 15 and then let's go.

3655
04:20:51,239 --> 04:20:51,879
Seven.

3656
04:20:51,879 --> 04:20:59,350
All right.

3657
04:20:59,430 --> 04:21:05,100
We're going 13.

3658
04:21:05,100 --> 04:21:13,340
Red.

3659
04:21:13,340 --> 04:21:13,819
Trips.

3660
04:21:13,819 --> 04:21:14,700
I don't even know what this means.

3661
04:21:14,700 --> 04:21:15,260
Go.

3662
04:21:15,260 --> 04:21:20,860
What's that?

3663
04:21:20,860 --> 04:21:21,260
Eight.

3664
04:21:21,260 --> 04:21:22,219
What's that going?

3665
04:21:22,219 --> 04:21:30,760
Wife and child are at home eating rotten food.

3666
04:21:33,299 --> 04:21:34,260
Fifteen.

3667
04:21:34,260 --> 04:21:35,739
Twelve to seventeen.

3668
04:21:37,940 --> 04:21:38,579
Run.

3669
04:21:38,579 --> 04:21:43,450
Roll dice.

3670
04:21:43,450 --> 04:21:44,090
Eleven.

3671
04:21:44,090 --> 04:22:02,250
Oh, fifteen.

3672
04:22:02,250 --> 04:22:03,049
Thank you.

3673
04:22:03,049 --> 04:22:04,420
This is close enough.

3674
04:22:04,420 --> 04:22:09,610
What's that pay?

3675
04:22:09,610 --> 04:22:10,569
Twenty-five.

3676
04:22:10,569 --> 04:22:27,379
Hey, you can't lose if you put it on like almost everything.

3677
04:22:27,379 --> 04:22:37,719
Oh, fuck.

3678
04:22:47,399 --> 04:23:09,049
Oh, get more chips.

3679
04:23:09,049 --> 04:23:09,770
Eleven.

3680
04:23:09,770 --> 04:23:13,590
I got it.

3681
04:23:13,590 --> 04:23:14,149
I got one.

3682
04:23:14,149 --> 04:23:15,930
What's that get me?

3683
04:23:15,930 --> 04:23:20,260
Twenty-one and twenty.

3684
04:23:20,260 --> 04:23:21,610
All right.

3685
04:23:21,610 --> 04:23:22,170
Look at that.

3686
04:23:22,170 --> 04:23:27,530
Let's go with eight.

3687
04:23:27,530 --> 04:23:38,229
Seven.

3688
04:23:38,229 --> 04:23:38,629
Got it.

3689
04:23:38,629 --> 04:23:41,420
All right.

3690
04:23:41,420 --> 04:23:42,219
What's that going to get me?

3691
04:23:42,219 --> 04:23:44,870
One hundred and forty.

3692
04:23:44,870 --> 04:23:45,510
Let's go.

3693
04:23:45,510 --> 04:23:51,159
I need to level up my gambling skill.

3694
04:23:51,159 --> 04:23:52,440
Ten.

3695
04:23:52,440 --> 04:23:56,579
Pair and keystone.

3696
04:23:56,579 --> 04:23:58,020
I don't even know what that means, but sure.

3697
04:23:58,020 --> 04:24:01,430
There it is.

3698
04:24:01,430 --> 04:24:14,520
Oh, eleven.

3699
04:24:14,520 --> 04:24:15,860
Keystone.

3700
04:24:15,860 --> 04:24:21,739
There it is.

3701
04:24:21,739 --> 04:24:23,059
I can't fucking count.

3702
04:24:23,059 --> 04:24:23,540
I know.

3703
04:24:23,540 --> 04:24:24,020
I know.

3704
04:24:24,020 --> 04:24:24,739
I can't do math.

3705
04:24:24,739 --> 04:24:26,020
I can't do math ever.

3706
04:24:26,020 --> 04:24:32,329
It's impossible.

3707
04:24:32,329 --> 04:24:34,040
Ten.

3708
04:24:34,040 --> 04:24:35,209
Eleven.

3709
04:24:35,209 --> 04:24:36,489
Keystone.

3710
04:24:36,489 --> 04:24:38,809
Pair and trips.

3711
04:24:38,809 --> 04:24:43,139
That's trips.

3712
04:24:43,139 --> 04:24:43,860
No, it's not.

3713
04:24:43,860 --> 04:24:59,930
Come on.

3714
04:24:59,930 --> 04:25:03,290
Put it on there.

3715
04:25:03,290 --> 04:25:04,969
I mean, if I get triples,

3716
04:25:04,969 --> 04:25:08,809
that's probably like a hundred and one.

3717
04:25:08,809 --> 04:25:09,450
There we go.

3718
04:25:09,450 --> 04:25:09,850
All right.

3719
04:25:09,850 --> 04:25:10,649
That's a big deal.

3720
04:25:10,649 --> 04:25:12,280
That's a big deal.

3721
04:25:12,280 --> 04:25:13,979
That's eighty.

3722
04:25:13,979 --> 04:25:14,459
That's forty.

3723
04:25:14,459 --> 04:25:14,940
That's a hundred.

3724
04:25:14,940 --> 04:25:16,299
That's not even that much.

3725
04:25:16,299 --> 04:25:27,420
Trips will hit huge if it lands.

3726
04:25:27,420 --> 04:25:31,159
All right.

3727
04:25:31,159 --> 04:25:31,559
I'm done.

3728
04:25:31,559 --> 04:25:34,010
I'm done.

3729
04:25:34,010 --> 04:25:51,079
This is just stupid.

3730
04:25:51,079 --> 04:25:51,319
Okay.

3731
04:25:51,319 --> 04:25:52,920
Sixty hundred points to the next level.

3732
04:25:52,920 --> 04:26:01,739
Build up a ton of debt.

3733
04:26:01,739 --> 04:26:04,280
I feel like that people will come after me.

3734
04:26:04,280 --> 04:26:04,440
All right.

3735
04:26:04,440 --> 04:26:06,600
Where's the lady I need to seduce?

3736
04:26:06,600 --> 04:26:12,729
I don't remember even who it is.

3737
04:26:12,729 --> 04:26:12,969
Alex.

3738
04:26:12,969 --> 04:26:13,209
Okay.

3739
04:26:13,209 --> 04:26:13,530
There we go.

3740
04:26:19,590 --> 04:26:22,680
All right.

3741
04:26:22,680 --> 04:26:23,479
What do you like?

3742
04:26:23,479 --> 04:26:25,690
He doesn't like play dead.

3743
04:26:25,690 --> 04:26:27,510
Oh, I have flowers.

3744
04:26:27,510 --> 04:26:29,020
I actually picked flowers.

3745
04:26:29,020 --> 04:26:29,420
I have them.

3746
04:26:33,459 --> 04:26:34,100
All right.

3747
04:26:34,100 --> 04:26:36,299
I have cheap flowers.

3748
04:26:36,299 --> 04:26:36,620
Here.

3749
04:26:52,309 --> 04:26:52,469
All right.

3750
04:26:52,469 --> 04:26:52,870
Let's go.

3751
04:26:52,870 --> 04:26:53,190
Come on.

3752
04:26:58,229 --> 04:26:59,670
That was the magic bullet voice.

3753
04:27:01,590 --> 04:27:04,149
That was absolutely fantastic.

3754
04:27:04,950 --> 04:27:07,750
And you have here a virgin strawberry.

3755
04:27:07,750 --> 04:27:13,989
Why does it want me to fart now?

3756
04:27:22,870 --> 04:27:23,350
Creepy.

3757
04:27:29,620 --> 04:27:30,180
Okay.

3758
04:27:30,180 --> 04:27:31,219
Convince her to marry you.

3759
04:27:41,540 --> 04:27:43,540
I almost got married once before.

3760
04:27:44,260 --> 04:27:47,860
He was a sweet boy, but we were both so young.

3761
04:27:47,860 --> 04:27:48,819
Too young.

3762
04:27:48,819 --> 04:27:52,340
I got scared and ran away the day of the wedding.

3763
04:27:53,379 --> 04:27:55,379
I hurt him so badly.

3764
04:27:55,379 --> 04:27:57,139
He took his own life.

3765
04:27:57,139 --> 04:27:59,620
I've carried that guilt with me all these years.

3766
04:27:59,620 --> 04:28:00,979
Never dreaming I could love again.

3767
04:28:00,979 --> 04:28:02,340
Can I get some fucking space?

3768
04:28:02,340 --> 04:28:03,059
Get away from me.

3769
04:28:07,799 --> 04:28:09,590
Uh, what do I do?

3770
04:28:10,229 --> 04:28:13,100
Destroy the rejection note and marry-

3771
04:28:13,100 --> 04:28:15,180
I have a wife and kid back at the-

3772
04:28:16,059 --> 04:28:16,780
At the house.

3773
04:28:17,579 --> 04:28:32,229
Somebody just wrote, dude, what the fuck?

3774
04:28:32,229 --> 04:28:34,469
Why is your character so gross and weird?

3775
04:28:34,469 --> 04:28:35,110
I don't know.

3776
04:28:35,110 --> 04:28:36,469
I don't know why that made me laugh so hard.

3777
04:28:38,600 --> 04:28:39,719
Kill this person?

3778
04:28:39,719 --> 04:28:41,079
No, although I didn't kill her.

3779
04:28:41,719 --> 04:28:44,459
Can you be married twice?

3780
04:28:44,459 --> 04:28:55,159
Would you like a drink?

3781
04:28:55,159 --> 04:28:59,159
The temples of light and shadows are always at each other's throats.

3782
04:29:00,440 --> 04:29:03,079
Being low on gold isn't much fun, is it?

3783
04:29:03,079 --> 04:29:03,879
Is he-

3784
04:29:03,879 --> 04:29:04,280
Is he-

3785
04:29:04,280 --> 04:29:06,280
Look at the size of you.

3786
04:29:06,280 --> 04:29:08,360
How do you go adventuring with them all?

3787
04:29:08,360 --> 04:29:09,399
You're engaged?

3788
04:29:09,399 --> 04:29:09,559
What?

3789
04:29:09,639 --> 04:29:11,799
I'll be your wife.

3790
04:29:11,799 --> 04:29:14,120
Wait, can I bring her back to the m-

3791
04:29:14,120 --> 04:29:15,159
To my house?

3792
04:29:16,040 --> 04:29:17,079
Wait a minute.

3793
04:29:17,079 --> 04:29:17,639
Wait a minute.

3794
04:29:18,649 --> 04:29:18,969
That-

3795
04:29:18,969 --> 04:29:20,170
Okay, you're joking, right?

3796
04:29:20,170 --> 04:29:22,889
Perhaps you should apply for gender in the same way.

3797
04:29:22,889 --> 04:29:24,010
Do I need to, like-

3798
04:29:25,559 --> 04:29:26,440
I don't understand.

3799
04:29:26,440 --> 04:29:29,319
Can we go back to the other property?

3800
04:29:31,190 --> 04:29:32,709
Can I bring her back?

3801
04:29:33,670 --> 04:29:36,139
Let's romantic for a second.

3802
04:29:36,139 --> 04:29:37,180
Leave me the fuck alone.

3803
04:29:41,020 --> 04:29:43,180
Can I evict myself?

3804
04:29:44,260 --> 04:29:47,780
Can I evict myself from the other house and then move in?

3805
04:29:47,780 --> 04:29:48,819
What happens to the baby?

3806
04:29:53,850 --> 04:29:54,809
I have to buy another house.

3807
04:29:54,809 --> 04:29:55,450
Oh god, okay.

3808
04:29:56,090 --> 04:29:57,319
I don't have any money.

3809
04:30:02,680 --> 04:30:04,520
How much is this one?

3810
04:30:04,520 --> 04:30:05,719
Okay, I don't have enough money.

3811
04:30:10,139 --> 04:30:10,780
Just hold on.

3812
04:30:10,780 --> 04:30:12,299
Let me go blacksmith for like a half an hour.

3813
04:30:27,180 --> 04:30:27,979
Okay, hold on.

3814
04:30:27,979 --> 04:30:28,940
I'll be down in a minute.

3815
04:30:29,819 --> 04:30:36,200
Have another baby?

3816
04:30:37,000 --> 04:30:42,219
So wait, you're telling me that I can just have like a bunch of children

3817
04:30:42,219 --> 04:30:43,500
with a bunch of different people?

3818
04:30:44,219 --> 04:30:47,799
I don't remember doing any of this in the game.

3819
04:30:48,600 --> 04:30:56,569
I just need to get to like six or seven grand.

3820
04:30:56,569 --> 04:31:00,520
This is not gambling.

3821
04:31:00,520 --> 04:31:01,399
This is done.

3822
04:31:01,399 --> 04:31:02,040
It's a job.

3823
04:31:02,040 --> 04:31:02,520
I can do it.

3824
04:31:02,520 --> 04:31:05,610
It's not gambling.

3825
04:31:05,610 --> 04:31:15,190
Create your family line.

3826
04:31:15,829 --> 04:31:17,270
I feel like I'm going to get confused.

3827
04:31:21,420 --> 04:31:26,020
I'm going to forget who is who.

3828
04:31:26,739 --> 04:31:35,420
All right, this is going to not take that long.

3829
04:31:35,420 --> 04:31:36,139
I just can't fuck it up.

3830
04:31:44,120 --> 04:31:44,840
All right, don't screw it up.

3831
04:31:51,079 --> 04:31:56,020
All right, wait for one rotation.

3832
04:31:59,750 --> 04:32:00,870
No need to rush.

3833
04:32:00,870 --> 04:32:01,510
You idiot!

3834
04:32:01,510 --> 04:32:05,639
I just told you not to do that and you did it anyways.

3835
04:32:05,639 --> 04:32:07,879
I was just talking to you.

3836
04:32:07,879 --> 04:32:08,680
Listen to me.

3837
04:32:08,680 --> 04:32:09,559
Why did I do that?

3838
04:32:18,620 --> 04:32:23,030
I'll get it.

3839
04:32:23,030 --> 04:32:27,979
It's because needing to wait that extra one second for some reason

3840
04:32:27,979 --> 04:32:31,059
is an eternity in my brain.

3841
04:32:31,059 --> 04:32:32,819
It's like, oh, it's so much.

3842
04:32:32,819 --> 04:32:33,620
It's so long.

3843
04:32:33,620 --> 04:32:34,420
I have to do it.

3844
04:32:34,979 --> 04:32:39,049
You know what I mean?

3845
04:32:40,010 --> 04:32:41,290
It's 100 years in my head.

3846
04:32:50,180 --> 04:32:50,819
Oh, OK.

3847
04:32:52,020 --> 04:32:54,459
I need what, 10 grand?

3848
04:32:54,459 --> 04:32:55,200
I'll get it.

3849
04:33:02,870 --> 04:33:04,700
OK, we're good.

3850
04:33:04,700 --> 04:33:09,130
We're going to be here all day.

3851
04:33:09,130 --> 04:33:10,009
No, we're not.

3852
04:33:10,009 --> 04:33:11,049
We have like another five minutes.

3853
04:33:11,770 --> 04:33:13,240
Holy shit.

3854
04:33:13,240 --> 04:33:14,520
OK, I'm screwed up.

3855
04:33:21,349 --> 04:33:22,310
Look at how shitty that is.

3856
04:33:23,029 --> 04:33:24,040
Look at that.

3857
04:33:24,040 --> 04:33:25,880
Do you see how weirdly that's moving?

3858
04:33:25,880 --> 04:33:26,919
It's like we could framey.

3859
04:33:27,720 --> 04:33:39,049
Oh, that sucks.

3860
04:33:39,689 --> 04:33:46,119
Oh, somebody's going to make me laugh.

3861
04:33:46,759 --> 04:33:48,680
You just made me laugh, but I have to pay attention.

3862
04:33:48,680 --> 04:33:51,479
I don't even want to say it out loud because it was really, really funny.

3863
04:33:51,479 --> 04:33:55,880
OK, I'm going to say it, but I'm going to make sure I pay attention to the game.

3864
04:33:56,740 --> 04:33:59,220
Somebody said this is the music from British Bake Off.

3865
04:34:00,180 --> 04:34:00,979
And it is.

3866
04:34:03,819 --> 04:34:04,319
It is.

3867
04:34:05,119 --> 04:34:16,040
I can't believe somebody found that.

3868
04:34:18,220 --> 04:34:24,139
This is a good combo.

3869
04:34:24,139 --> 04:34:24,700
Don't fuck it up.

3870
04:34:30,279 --> 04:34:31,959
600 per sword.

3871
04:34:39,080 --> 04:34:41,240
Oh my god, I'm stupid.

3872
04:34:41,240 --> 04:34:42,759
Why would I do that to myself?

3873
04:34:43,400 --> 04:34:45,000
There's no reason to do that.

3874
04:34:45,880 --> 04:34:47,159
Oh my god.

3875
04:34:47,159 --> 04:34:48,759
Why am I doing that to myself?

3876
04:34:58,779 --> 04:34:59,580
I'm sorry.

3877
04:35:00,139 --> 04:35:00,939
I had to.

3878
04:35:01,659 --> 04:35:07,919
Just a man working hard to cheat on his family.

3879
04:35:07,919 --> 04:35:14,759
You're doing a good job.

3880
04:35:14,759 --> 04:35:15,259
10 grand.

3881
04:35:20,240 --> 04:35:20,959
All right, don't...

3882
04:35:20,959 --> 04:35:21,360
I'm not...

3883
04:35:21,360 --> 04:35:21,860
All right.

3884
04:35:22,860 --> 04:35:23,360
If I...

3885
04:35:24,380 --> 04:35:25,099
I have to do this.

3886
04:35:25,099 --> 04:35:26,860
I have to say this, otherwise I won't stop.

3887
04:35:27,580 --> 04:35:34,430
If I don't wait for one bounce, add 50 billion dollars to the debt.

3888
04:35:34,430 --> 04:35:35,979
OK, that's the only...

3889
04:35:35,979 --> 04:35:37,340
I'm forcing myself to do that.

3890
04:35:37,340 --> 04:35:40,009
It has to be one bounce.

3891
04:35:40,009 --> 04:35:44,139
That's how you make a blade.

3892
04:35:44,139 --> 04:35:52,029
See, now I forced myself to do it.

3893
04:35:52,830 --> 04:36:01,709
It's like a devil in my brain that's like,

3894
04:36:01,709 --> 04:36:02,669
press it, press it now.

3895
04:36:03,310 --> 04:36:03,810
Nope.

3896
04:36:05,709 --> 04:36:06,430
I won't do it.

3897
04:36:06,430 --> 04:36:07,310
I'm not gonna do it.

3898
04:36:07,310 --> 04:36:19,759
We're good.

3899
04:36:24,720 --> 04:36:25,439
There we go.

3900
04:36:28,560 --> 04:36:33,369
It's gonna be funny if you didn't do that.

3901
04:36:33,369 --> 04:36:34,650
Well, it's not gonna happen.

3902
04:36:36,250 --> 04:36:40,639
So does this ghost know that what I did?

3903
04:36:51,209 --> 04:36:53,290
Your new wife is watching you right now.

3904
04:36:53,290 --> 04:36:53,790
Yeah.

3905
04:36:54,250 --> 04:37:01,790
I'll buy a house here in Bowerstone.

3906
04:37:04,060 --> 04:37:05,659
That blade's complete.

3907
04:37:05,659 --> 04:37:06,380
He's a ghost.

3908
04:37:06,380 --> 04:37:06,939
Who cares?

3909
04:37:09,080 --> 04:37:16,159
I really do like this fact that I'm forcing myself to wait.

3910
04:37:16,720 --> 04:37:18,720
It's very helpful.

3911
04:37:19,360 --> 04:37:22,939
All right.

3912
04:37:22,939 --> 04:37:25,979
Now I don't care if I lose, I lose, but I have 10 grand now.

3913
04:37:26,540 --> 04:37:32,020
OK.

3914
04:37:32,020 --> 04:37:32,520
Goodbye.

3915
04:37:32,520 --> 04:37:33,279
Don't you know how to use a hammer?

3916
04:37:33,279 --> 04:37:33,599
Goodbye.

3917
04:37:33,599 --> 04:37:36,110
I'm out.

3918
04:37:36,110 --> 04:37:37,069
Everybody loves me.

3919
04:37:37,709 --> 04:37:39,040
What is this?

3920
04:37:47,259 --> 04:37:47,900
Oh my god.

3921
04:37:47,900 --> 04:37:49,340
Everybody thinks I'm so attractive.

3922
04:37:50,060 --> 04:37:52,919
OK.

3923
04:37:52,919 --> 04:37:54,040
How do I get this present from you?

3924
04:37:54,919 --> 04:37:55,790
All right.

3925
04:37:55,790 --> 04:37:56,909
I'm gonna be funny.

3926
04:37:56,909 --> 04:38:00,349
If you were really a proper adventurer, I would have heard of you.

3927
04:38:06,810 --> 04:38:08,000
All right.

3928
04:38:08,000 --> 04:38:08,720
You think that's funny?

3929
04:38:09,439 --> 04:38:10,319
What else do you think is funny?

3930
04:38:10,479 --> 04:38:11,040
Good.

3931
04:38:11,040 --> 04:38:11,840
Very good.

3932
04:38:12,959 --> 04:38:13,759
Dancing.

3933
04:38:13,759 --> 04:38:14,240
It's funny.

3934
04:38:16,240 --> 04:38:20,490
It's because I have a bunch of money?

3935
04:38:21,369 --> 04:38:22,959
OK.

3936
04:38:22,959 --> 04:38:23,680
I want my present.

3937
04:38:25,759 --> 04:38:26,479
Wait.

3938
04:38:26,479 --> 04:38:27,680
Am I gonna put a ring on you?

3939
04:38:28,479 --> 04:38:28,720
Wait.

3940
04:38:28,720 --> 04:38:29,279
How does this work?

3941
04:38:34,799 --> 04:38:35,299
What?

3942
04:38:41,240 --> 04:38:44,840
Like I used to?

3943
04:38:44,840 --> 04:38:45,959
Wait.

3944
04:38:45,959 --> 04:38:46,439
What happened?

3945
04:39:00,840 --> 04:39:01,720
Give me back the ring.

3946
04:39:01,720 --> 04:39:02,520
Can I have the ring back?

3947
04:39:10,520 --> 04:39:11,580
Oh, thanks, kid.

3948
04:39:19,799 --> 04:39:19,959
All right.

3949
04:39:19,959 --> 04:39:20,599
Give me that present.

3950
04:39:22,349 --> 04:39:23,790
Watered down XP potion.

3951
04:39:23,790 --> 04:39:24,290
OK.

3952
04:39:34,700 --> 04:39:37,500
Am I gonna have a new wife in front of the old new wife?

3953
04:39:37,580 --> 04:39:43,020
So I have a wife with a kid in a different town.

3954
04:39:43,020 --> 04:39:45,419
I married, I engaged this person over here.

3955
04:39:46,459 --> 04:39:48,860
And then now I have, this is a wife now.

3956
04:39:49,500 --> 04:39:53,659
Are we good?

3957
04:39:56,560 --> 04:39:57,439
Find a good ring.

3958
04:39:58,400 --> 04:39:59,119
Oh, shit.

3959
04:39:59,119 --> 04:39:59,360
OK.

3960
04:39:59,360 --> 04:39:59,680
Hold on.

3961
04:40:06,720 --> 04:40:08,169
Give him the electric chair.

3962
04:40:08,169 --> 04:40:09,290
Not, I can't do that.

3963
04:40:09,290 --> 04:40:09,529
No.

3964
04:40:09,529 --> 04:40:10,090
I need a ring.

3965
04:40:10,729 --> 04:40:12,810
Where can I buy a ring?

3966
04:40:12,810 --> 04:40:13,209
Somebody.

3967
04:40:13,209 --> 04:40:14,009
Somebody sell me a ring.

3968
04:40:14,880 --> 04:40:15,599
Who sells the ring?

3969
04:40:18,830 --> 04:40:20,509
Can I buy this meat shop?

3970
04:40:21,959 --> 04:40:22,840
Oh, shit.

3971
04:40:22,840 --> 04:40:29,900
It's Paul the stall vendor.

3972
04:40:29,900 --> 04:40:31,180
Wait, can we, can I?

3973
04:40:32,200 --> 04:40:33,240
Wait, who wants to be intimate?

3974
04:40:34,599 --> 04:40:34,840
You?

3975
04:40:35,639 --> 04:40:36,860
Who the hell are you?

3976
04:40:39,200 --> 04:40:39,759
What?

3977
04:40:39,759 --> 04:40:40,400
What's going on?

3978
04:40:41,119 --> 04:40:48,029
Whose house is this?

3979
04:40:51,209 --> 04:40:51,930
Potion shop.

3980
04:40:51,930 --> 04:40:52,729
No, I need a house.

3981
04:40:53,369 --> 04:41:00,409
How much is this house?

3982
04:41:00,409 --> 04:41:01,689
Uh, the silk moon.

3983
04:41:01,689 --> 04:41:02,009
OK.

3984
04:41:02,009 --> 04:41:03,919
It's a, yeah.

3985
04:41:03,919 --> 04:41:04,479
Buy and move in.

3986
04:41:04,479 --> 04:41:05,200
Let's go.

3987
04:41:05,200 --> 04:41:11,340
This is my marital home.

3988
04:41:11,340 --> 04:41:12,909
All right.

3989
04:41:12,909 --> 04:41:13,310
Come with me.

3990
04:41:13,310 --> 04:41:14,110
Get in here.

3991
04:41:14,110 --> 04:41:14,669
What are we doing?

3992
04:41:15,229 --> 04:41:24,830
Who just like wanted to like come and like have sex with me?

3993
04:41:25,470 --> 04:41:27,400
Is that what she was asking?

3994
04:41:29,400 --> 04:41:31,319
Somebody was like, oh, let's go find somewhere private.

3995
04:41:31,319 --> 04:41:31,880
Who was that?

3996
04:41:33,720 --> 04:41:35,159
Miriam the traveler.

3997
04:41:43,400 --> 04:41:44,759
Who is coming into this house?

3998
04:41:49,689 --> 04:41:50,970
Rachel, the housewife?

3999
04:41:59,180 --> 04:42:00,220
Room about trees.

4000
04:42:23,680 --> 04:42:24,720
It has to be Alex.

4001
04:42:25,520 --> 04:42:27,000
Does it?

4002
04:42:27,000 --> 04:42:27,240
OK.

4003
04:42:27,240 --> 04:42:28,439
Well, where's Alex?

4004
04:42:31,439 --> 04:42:34,240
Alex, where'd she go?

4005
04:42:34,799 --> 04:42:42,119
It has to be Alex.

4006
04:42:43,150 --> 04:42:43,869
Well, where's Alex?

4007
04:42:45,880 --> 04:42:46,680
Have to find her now?

4008
04:42:55,880 --> 04:42:56,680
I don't even know who this is.

4009
04:43:13,840 --> 04:43:28,409
I don't even know who this is.

4010
04:43:28,409 --> 04:43:31,319
Rachel's the lady from the beginning of the stream.

4011
04:43:31,319 --> 04:43:32,599
Oh, I look like it's gross.

4012
04:43:33,159 --> 04:43:41,020
Why are there two beds?

4013
04:43:50,590 --> 04:43:51,790
Then we could get my.

4014
04:43:51,790 --> 04:43:53,389
Well, you don't like the ring that I have.

4015
04:43:58,619 --> 04:44:00,540
Oh, I'm about to start throwing lightning.

4016
04:44:00,540 --> 04:44:01,259
All right.

4017
04:44:01,259 --> 04:44:11,319
Remember, you're not a good boy anymore.

4018
04:44:11,319 --> 04:44:11,959
I know.

4019
04:44:11,959 --> 04:44:13,319
I'm not a good boy anymore.

4020
04:44:13,319 --> 04:44:13,799
You're right.

4021
04:44:15,689 --> 04:44:16,169
OK, wait.

4022
04:44:16,169 --> 04:44:16,650
Where's right?

4023
04:44:17,369 --> 04:44:31,560
Where's Alex?

4024
04:44:31,560 --> 04:44:35,840
Hey, pretty good.

4025
04:44:52,029 --> 04:44:53,150
That's 22.

4026
04:44:53,150 --> 04:44:53,709
Holy shit.

4027
04:45:08,490 --> 04:45:10,970
Stop trying to seduce people with TikTok dances.

4028
04:45:12,669 --> 04:45:21,369
OK, so how are we doing?

4029
04:45:23,159 --> 04:45:23,880
We good?

4030
04:45:23,880 --> 04:45:24,520
All right.

4031
04:45:24,520 --> 04:45:27,240
You remember we're a genius, right?

4032
04:45:27,240 --> 04:45:28,680
You kind of like me a little bit.

4033
04:45:30,509 --> 04:45:31,389
I need a better ring, though.

4034
04:45:31,389 --> 04:45:32,029
What can I buy a ring?

4035
04:45:47,689 --> 04:45:49,130
Town criers over here now.

4036
04:45:50,650 --> 04:45:51,770
Did you ask how did I do it?

4037
04:45:52,330 --> 04:45:55,770
Well, you see, you take your hands and you make little waves.

4038
04:45:55,770 --> 04:45:57,450
Pretending that you're like you're you're strong.

4039
04:45:57,450 --> 04:45:58,569
Like that's like the body.

4040
04:46:15,000 --> 04:46:22,779
OK, it's time to open it.

4041
04:46:22,779 --> 04:46:23,819
I got to go to the jeweler.

4042
04:46:23,819 --> 04:46:27,099
OK, all right.

4043
04:46:39,150 --> 04:46:43,549
Oh, everybody here is in love with me.

4044
04:46:43,549 --> 04:46:48,159
Oh, my God.

4045
04:46:48,159 --> 04:46:49,040
This is ridiculous.

4046
04:46:49,040 --> 04:46:49,680
What's going on?

4047
04:46:52,439 --> 04:46:54,279
Like you and maybe over here.

4048
04:46:54,279 --> 04:46:54,919
How about you?

4049
04:46:55,479 --> 04:46:56,759
I like you too.

4050
04:46:57,319 --> 04:46:57,639
Oops.

4051
04:47:00,509 --> 04:47:01,310
This is weird.

4052
04:47:01,310 --> 04:47:02,750
It's this weird, isn't it?

4053
04:47:14,619 --> 04:47:14,939
All right.

4054
04:47:14,939 --> 04:47:16,779
So when is the stores open?

4055
04:47:20,169 --> 04:47:21,290
If somebody's giving me a gift.

4056
04:47:26,959 --> 04:47:27,520
Who is this?

4057
04:47:27,520 --> 04:47:29,119
Oh, that's the town crier.

4058
04:47:32,590 --> 04:47:35,790
But still, it'd be nice if yours were a bit better.

4059
04:47:35,790 --> 04:47:36,029
What?

4060
04:47:36,029 --> 04:47:36,669
My clothes are fine.

4061
04:47:36,669 --> 04:47:37,310
What are you talking about?

4062
04:47:42,700 --> 04:47:42,860
All right.

4063
04:47:42,860 --> 04:47:43,819
When does the jeweler open?

4064
04:47:46,840 --> 04:47:49,770
Nice.

4065
04:47:50,729 --> 04:47:55,130
I can say I like that a lot.

4066
04:47:55,130 --> 04:47:56,250
That's well done.

4067
04:47:59,180 --> 04:48:01,419
This is just the icing.

4068
04:48:01,419 --> 04:48:05,099
This is just so lovely and sweet.

4069
04:48:06,060 --> 04:48:09,099
OK, where's the jeweler?

4070
04:48:09,900 --> 04:48:12,810
I'm done fucking around.

4071
04:48:13,689 --> 04:48:14,490
Jewelry stall.

4072
04:48:14,490 --> 04:48:15,049
Here we go.

4073
04:48:15,049 --> 04:48:16,569
No, I don't want to buy the property.

4074
04:48:16,569 --> 04:48:17,770
I want to buy jewelry.

4075
04:48:28,959 --> 04:48:30,720
I mean, I want to hit the guy with the fucking axe.

4076
04:48:34,490 --> 04:48:35,369
I want to hit him with an axe.

4077
04:48:41,130 --> 04:48:45,599
All right.

4078
04:48:45,599 --> 04:48:47,180
Come on.

4079
04:48:47,180 --> 04:48:47,900
We're almost done.

4080
04:48:47,900 --> 04:48:48,540
We're almost ready.

4081
04:48:50,169 --> 04:48:51,209
Open the stores, please.

4082
04:48:54,200 --> 04:48:55,319
Oh, look at the size of him.

4083
04:49:10,840 --> 04:49:11,720
Bad and ugly.

4084
04:49:11,720 --> 04:49:13,080
I'm not bad and ugly.

4085
04:49:15,159 --> 04:49:21,080
Look at the pie stand.

4086
04:49:21,880 --> 04:49:32,520
What's wrong with the pie stand?

4087
04:49:37,450 --> 04:49:38,330
Adjust prices.

4088
04:49:39,049 --> 04:49:47,740
Setting the prices lower is an act of purity.

4089
04:49:47,740 --> 04:49:49,040
How much are they?

4090
04:49:49,040 --> 04:49:49,840
A pie is what?

4091
04:49:50,400 --> 04:50:01,099
All right.

4092
04:50:01,099 --> 04:50:01,419
Open.

4093
04:50:01,419 --> 04:50:01,900
Here we go.

4094
04:50:02,919 --> 04:50:03,799
Open the stores.

4095
04:50:05,630 --> 04:50:06,349
Thank you.

4096
04:50:06,349 --> 04:50:06,909
Hurry up.

4097
04:50:18,599 --> 04:50:24,990
All right.

4098
04:50:24,990 --> 04:50:25,869
I need the jeweler.

4099
04:50:32,990 --> 04:50:34,270
Get to your posts.

4100
04:50:34,270 --> 04:50:35,229
Let's go.

4101
04:50:35,229 --> 04:50:37,560
Where's the jeweler?

4102
04:50:43,419 --> 04:50:49,200
Should I just buy 10 rings?

4103
04:50:49,200 --> 04:50:49,919
Stop.

4104
04:50:49,919 --> 04:51:00,189
Where's the person that sells me shit?

4105
04:51:00,189 --> 04:51:00,590
Get...

4106
04:51:00,590 --> 04:51:01,310
It's you.

4107
04:51:01,310 --> 04:51:02,189
Get over there.

4108
04:51:02,189 --> 04:51:04,189
Can I buy shit from you, please?

4109
04:51:04,189 --> 04:51:07,549
You're the stall vendor.

4110
04:51:07,549 --> 04:51:07,869
All right.

4111
04:51:07,869 --> 04:51:08,750
Get behind the stall.

4112
04:51:09,389 --> 04:51:15,680
Holy shit.

4113
04:51:15,680 --> 04:51:16,560
I just missed that lady.

4114
04:51:17,200 --> 04:51:22,090
There's the jeweler.

4115
04:51:22,090 --> 04:51:22,970
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

4116
04:51:22,970 --> 04:51:23,610
Come here, come here, come here.

4117
04:51:29,849 --> 04:51:30,090
All right.

4118
04:51:30,090 --> 04:51:31,610
I'm going to buy the ring and give it to her.

4119
04:51:32,889 --> 04:51:33,369
Okay.

4120
04:51:33,369 --> 04:51:33,930
Here we go.

4121
04:51:34,490 --> 04:51:35,560
Okay.

4122
04:51:36,119 --> 04:51:37,880
Becoming a parent.

4123
04:51:41,419 --> 04:51:42,060
Civil ring.

4124
04:51:44,319 --> 04:51:44,639
Okay.

4125
04:51:44,639 --> 04:51:45,200
There we go.

4126
04:51:47,680 --> 04:51:49,040
Eternal love ring.

4127
04:51:49,040 --> 04:51:49,279
No.

4128
04:51:53,209 --> 04:51:54,330
Now get a forever ring.

4129
04:51:54,970 --> 04:51:55,529
Just in case.

4130
04:51:56,330 --> 04:51:57,450
What is this one?

4131
04:51:57,450 --> 04:51:58,680
Love potion?

4132
04:52:01,319 --> 04:52:02,599
I'm spending all my fucking money.

4133
04:52:02,599 --> 04:52:03,560
I don't want to spend all my money.

4134
04:52:11,369 --> 04:52:12,650
Where's that kid's parents?

4135
04:52:12,650 --> 04:52:12,889
All right.

4136
04:52:13,849 --> 04:52:15,209
Oh, it's time.

4137
04:52:15,770 --> 04:52:16,409
All right, Alex.

4138
04:52:16,409 --> 04:52:16,729
Come here.

4139
04:52:25,000 --> 04:52:25,319
Alex.

4140
04:52:27,630 --> 04:52:28,029
No.

4141
04:52:28,029 --> 04:52:28,509
There you are.

4142
04:52:30,830 --> 04:52:32,750
I don't want to give you the expensive ring.

4143
04:52:38,029 --> 04:52:38,509
Whatever.

4144
04:52:38,509 --> 04:52:38,909
Let's go.

4145
04:52:39,470 --> 04:52:40,189
What do you think?

4146
04:52:40,830 --> 04:52:42,430
Let's go.

4147
04:52:42,430 --> 04:52:42,750
Come on.

4148
04:52:43,869 --> 04:52:49,099
Okay.

4149
04:52:49,099 --> 04:52:50,220
Now let's go home.

4150
04:52:54,139 --> 04:52:54,860
Hey, look at that.

4151
04:52:55,500 --> 04:52:56,299
Marital home.

4152
04:53:07,720 --> 04:53:08,919
On a sunny morning.

4153
04:53:08,919 --> 04:53:09,639
Under a clear sky.

4154
04:53:09,639 --> 04:53:10,599
What's a bigamist?

4155
04:53:10,599 --> 04:53:13,720
The villagers crowded together to witness two people stand.

4156
04:53:13,720 --> 04:53:16,279
Is that if you're married to more than one person and you have fat?

4157
04:53:16,279 --> 04:53:18,360
Some say they were a strange couple.

4158
04:53:18,360 --> 04:53:20,840
Others that they saw a story of true love.

4159
04:53:20,840 --> 04:53:28,439
Only time would tell.

4160
04:53:28,439 --> 04:53:29,000
Okay.

4161
04:53:29,000 --> 04:53:33,549
I just know we're going to be so happy together.

4162
04:53:33,549 --> 04:53:34,189
Yes, we will.

4163
04:53:35,150 --> 04:53:36,830
Hey, you.

4164
04:53:37,549 --> 04:53:41,360
You are a lovely elite.

4165
04:53:41,360 --> 04:53:42,330
I got a nice house.

4166
04:53:42,330 --> 04:53:42,810
All right.

4167
04:53:42,810 --> 04:53:44,250
I want to get close to you.

4168
04:53:44,250 --> 04:53:46,490
Yes, really close.

4169
04:53:46,490 --> 04:53:46,729
Yes.

4170
04:53:48,650 --> 04:53:50,639
Let's go upstairs.

4171
04:53:59,080 --> 04:53:59,560
All right.

4172
04:54:01,200 --> 04:54:01,680
Here we go.

4173
04:54:19,639 --> 04:54:30,720
How about we find a quiet place and have some fun?

4174
04:54:30,720 --> 04:54:31,520
What do you think I'm trying to do?

4175
04:54:32,319 --> 04:54:35,849
I'd never say no to you, darling.

4176
04:54:36,490 --> 04:54:45,049
People find me more attractive.

4177
04:54:46,799 --> 04:54:47,919
Wait, we didn't even do anything.

4178
04:54:49,790 --> 04:54:50,909
Just plus 20.

4179
04:54:53,470 --> 04:54:54,509
What was that?

4180
04:54:54,509 --> 04:54:55,630
Plus 20 disgust?

4181
04:54:58,029 --> 04:54:58,590
What happened?

4182
04:55:00,029 --> 04:55:01,369
What do you mean over there?

4183
04:55:02,490 --> 04:55:05,400
You're saying that I have a gross house?

4184
04:55:11,639 --> 04:55:12,759
Oh my god.

4185
04:55:16,270 --> 04:55:18,430
Your house is fucking disgusting.

4186
04:55:29,319 --> 04:55:29,799
Uh-oh.

4187
04:55:34,520 --> 04:55:35,400
Oh, a baby.

4188
04:55:37,880 --> 04:55:45,049
Is this kid's name?

4189
04:55:51,919 --> 04:55:52,639
What does this kid like?

4190
04:55:57,580 --> 04:55:59,099
I wanted to do more info.

4191
04:55:59,099 --> 04:55:59,979
Put the gun.

4192
04:56:07,479 --> 04:56:10,680
Exit game, exit game, exit game.

4193
04:56:11,959 --> 04:56:18,729
How do I get out of this?

4194
04:56:19,610 --> 04:56:20,409
Oh shit.

4195
04:56:21,290 --> 04:56:23,130
Are we all right?

4196
04:56:23,770 --> 04:56:24,569
No, no, no, no.

4197
04:56:24,569 --> 04:56:25,130
I'm sorry.

4198
04:56:25,689 --> 04:56:29,069
Is the baby still in there?

4199
04:56:29,709 --> 04:56:35,880
It likes the loot.

4200
04:56:35,880 --> 04:56:36,200
Okay.

4201
04:56:36,919 --> 04:56:40,830
Where's my loot?

4202
04:56:41,549 --> 04:56:42,189
I had a loot.

4203
04:56:42,189 --> 04:56:42,590
Where is it?

4204
04:56:49,869 --> 04:56:50,430
What do you want?

4205
04:57:05,900 --> 04:57:11,689
Are you fucking serious?

4206
04:57:22,279 --> 04:57:23,159
How do I do this?

4207
04:57:27,479 --> 04:57:28,759
Okay, come over here.

4208
04:57:28,759 --> 04:57:35,560
The other bed?

4209
04:57:36,279 --> 04:57:53,000
Why can't we do this?

4210
04:57:57,479 --> 04:57:58,759
Switch targets?

4211
04:57:58,759 --> 04:58:02,220
I just had some seafood earlier.

4212
04:58:02,220 --> 04:58:03,959
Tell her to follow you.

4213
04:58:26,040 --> 04:58:26,439
Damn it.

4214
04:58:26,439 --> 04:58:28,040
Did I miss the opportunity?

4215
04:58:28,040 --> 04:58:29,560
That would have been fucking hilarious.

4216
04:58:30,200 --> 04:58:33,799
You used the thumbs up on the baby.

4217
04:58:36,599 --> 04:58:37,400
I can still do it?

4218
04:58:38,360 --> 04:58:39,560
Do I have to go find a different bed?

4219
04:58:46,590 --> 04:58:47,389
Oh my god.

4220
04:58:47,389 --> 04:58:47,709
Damn it.

4221
04:58:49,069 --> 04:58:50,919
Do I have to flirt?

4222
04:58:56,159 --> 04:58:57,400
I need to hurry to leave.

4223
04:58:58,279 --> 04:58:59,080
I'm too tired?

4224
04:59:19,979 --> 04:59:23,099
It's on cooldown?

4225
04:59:23,740 --> 04:59:24,619
It can't be.

4226
04:59:37,470 --> 04:59:38,029
Damn it.

4227
04:59:38,029 --> 04:59:40,509
Oh, we had such a funny moment there.

4228
04:59:40,509 --> 04:59:41,310
Oh well.

4229
04:59:41,310 --> 04:59:42,650
Just keep flirting with her.

4230
04:59:52,639 --> 04:59:52,959
Come on.

4231
04:59:59,709 --> 05:00:00,189
Come on.

4232
05:00:00,189 --> 05:00:01,310
Well, what do you think I'm trying to do?

4233
05:00:12,970 --> 05:00:14,169
What are you waiting for?

4234
05:00:15,209 --> 05:00:21,020
He makes me go goo.

4235
05:00:21,020 --> 05:00:22,459
Oh my god.

4236
05:00:22,459 --> 05:00:23,659
No, don't.

4237
05:00:46,959 --> 05:00:48,159
Does she know?

4238
05:00:48,159 --> 05:00:52,680
Do you want to send your property gypsy caravan?

4239
05:00:56,569 --> 05:00:57,209
No, wait.

4240
05:01:00,490 --> 05:01:00,729
What?

4241
05:01:00,729 --> 05:01:01,610
Where are we going?

4242
05:01:03,529 --> 05:01:03,770
Wait.

4243
05:01:09,450 --> 05:01:12,569
How many people in this house looking to get fucking married?

4244
05:01:13,450 --> 05:01:16,169
Who's this guy?

4245
05:01:16,169 --> 05:01:17,930
Who is this person?

4246
05:01:18,970 --> 05:01:19,930
What are you doing?

4247
05:01:19,930 --> 05:01:21,290
Rob the house husband.

4248
05:01:22,090 --> 05:01:24,970
Wait, did you just get a new husband?

4249
05:01:30,959 --> 05:01:32,959
Who is dating who in this house?

4250
05:01:33,599 --> 05:01:34,560
Who are these people?

4251
05:01:43,259 --> 05:01:44,459
I have no idea what's going on.

4252
05:01:45,020 --> 05:01:45,819
All right, I gotta go.

4253
05:01:46,779 --> 05:01:50,279
Go back to the ghost?

4254
05:01:50,279 --> 05:01:51,159
Oh shit, that's right.

4255
05:02:07,369 --> 05:02:09,689
When she came up, she was like, oh, you want to go somewhere nice?

4256
05:02:10,330 --> 05:02:13,770
Oh, if I could have had actual sex with her in there.

4257
05:02:14,330 --> 05:02:24,759
That would have been the stupidest thing ever.

4258
05:02:24,759 --> 05:02:26,439
You ran away from it all?

4259
05:02:26,439 --> 05:02:28,520
Well, I need to go back to the ghost.

4260
05:02:29,319 --> 05:02:32,220
That was an actual wife's boyfriend in there.

4261
05:02:32,220 --> 05:02:33,259
The house husband.

4262
05:02:37,450 --> 05:02:37,770
What?

4263
05:02:39,799 --> 05:02:41,319
Why are these people following me?

4264
05:02:48,569 --> 05:02:49,290
Oh god.

4265
05:02:50,250 --> 05:02:51,529
Is this quest even tracked?

4266
05:02:55,340 --> 05:02:56,220
Yeah, this is tracked.

4267
05:03:04,720 --> 05:03:05,759
You need to kill them.

4268
05:03:07,849 --> 05:03:08,490
I can't.

4269
05:03:11,439 --> 05:03:12,400
I can't do it.

4270
05:03:13,279 --> 05:03:13,919
It's evil.

4271
05:03:13,919 --> 05:03:14,799
I can't.

4272
05:03:14,799 --> 05:03:15,360
What was that?

4273
05:03:18,520 --> 05:03:20,599
Oh shit, she's got shot.

4274
05:03:21,720 --> 05:03:23,159
Oh god.

4275
05:03:23,159 --> 05:03:24,360
No, wait, wait.

4276
05:03:24,360 --> 05:03:25,560
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4277
05:03:25,560 --> 05:03:26,279
Please, please, please.

4278
05:03:27,000 --> 05:03:27,319
Don't.

4279
05:03:28,599 --> 05:03:29,400
Oh no.

4280
05:03:32,479 --> 05:03:33,360
Get out of the way.

4281
05:03:36,860 --> 05:03:39,790
Oh, run.

4282
05:03:39,790 --> 05:03:40,430
Run away.

4283
05:03:42,830 --> 05:03:43,549
My god.

4284
05:03:45,869 --> 05:03:46,669
Get out of here.

4285
05:03:47,389 --> 05:03:49,389
Holy shit.

4286
05:03:49,389 --> 05:03:50,110
They're still alive.

4287
05:03:50,110 --> 05:03:50,830
They're still alive.

4288
05:03:51,389 --> 05:03:52,889
They're fine.

4289
05:03:53,450 --> 05:03:54,330
Oh my god.

4290
05:03:54,330 --> 05:03:55,049
That was horrible.

4291
05:03:58,479 --> 05:03:58,799
Okay.

4292
05:03:58,799 --> 05:03:59,439
Where am I going?

4293
05:04:02,720 --> 05:04:03,119
All right.

4294
05:04:03,119 --> 05:04:04,720
She got shot in the neck.

4295
05:04:04,720 --> 05:04:05,680
That was horrible.

4296
05:04:06,319 --> 05:04:09,950
All right.

4297
05:04:11,389 --> 05:04:12,029
No, I can't.

4298
05:04:15,500 --> 05:04:16,060
Where is this?

4299
05:04:18,720 --> 05:04:19,919
Why is it making me go this way?

4300
05:04:19,919 --> 05:04:21,360
Till death do us part.

4301
05:04:21,360 --> 05:04:22,799
I want this one tracked.

4302
05:04:22,799 --> 05:04:25,840
Power stone.

4303
05:04:25,840 --> 05:04:26,560
Isn't that where I am?

4304
05:04:27,119 --> 05:04:31,790
That's where I am.

4305
05:04:51,130 --> 05:04:51,849
Oh my god.

4306
05:04:51,849 --> 05:04:52,650
That's so funny.

4307
05:04:58,000 --> 05:04:58,720
Okay, let's go.

4308
05:05:02,220 --> 05:05:02,939
So much.

4309
05:05:03,819 --> 05:05:05,340
You think it's time you got a ring?

4310
05:05:12,169 --> 05:05:13,770
I'm working on it.

4311
05:05:13,770 --> 05:05:25,979
What?

4312
05:05:50,409 --> 05:05:50,729
All right.

4313
05:05:50,729 --> 05:05:52,569
I have to get her safely out of here.

4314
05:05:53,369 --> 05:05:54,729
Is that what was dead?

4315
05:05:55,770 --> 05:06:02,119
You all right?

4316
05:06:02,119 --> 05:06:02,680
Where you going?

4317
05:06:02,680 --> 05:06:03,159
Where you going?

4318
05:06:03,159 --> 05:06:03,479
Ow.

4319
05:06:04,200 --> 05:06:13,610
Okay.

4320
05:06:13,610 --> 05:06:19,389
Well, there's an interaction to tell you to stop following you.

4321
05:06:19,389 --> 05:06:24,799
She's dead?

4322
05:06:27,000 --> 05:06:27,959
Hey, well.

4323
05:06:27,959 --> 05:06:28,680
For your trouble.

4324
05:06:29,240 --> 05:06:30,119
How about a ruby?

4325
05:06:31,759 --> 05:06:32,080
Hold on.

4326
05:06:32,080 --> 05:06:34,240
We gotta bury this other lady first.

4327
05:06:34,240 --> 05:06:51,069
There's nothing in here.

4328
05:06:51,069 --> 05:06:51,709
What's wrong?

4329
05:06:51,709 --> 05:06:59,319
Am I not close enough?

4330
05:06:59,319 --> 05:06:59,959
There we go.

4331
05:07:02,750 --> 05:07:03,950
Instant Java potion.

4332
05:07:03,950 --> 05:07:04,270
Cool.

4333
05:07:04,270 --> 05:07:12,669
All right.

4334
05:07:12,669 --> 05:07:12,990
Ooh.

4335
05:07:21,819 --> 05:07:22,060
All right.

4336
05:07:22,060 --> 05:07:22,700
We're almost there.

4337
05:07:29,130 --> 05:07:29,689
Where are you?

4338
05:07:31,520 --> 05:07:32,560
Oh, god.

4339
05:07:32,560 --> 05:07:32,880
All right.

4340
05:07:32,880 --> 05:07:33,360
You know what?

4341
05:07:33,360 --> 05:07:34,400
You have to go.

4342
05:07:34,400 --> 05:07:34,720
Okay.

4343
05:07:34,720 --> 05:07:34,959
Wait.

4344
05:07:34,959 --> 05:07:36,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4345
05:07:36,080 --> 05:07:36,880
I said you gotta send you back.

4346
05:07:36,880 --> 05:07:37,200
Send you home.

4347
05:07:37,200 --> 05:07:37,680
Send you home.

4348
05:07:38,400 --> 05:07:40,159
Where are you running towards the people with the guns?

4349
05:07:40,799 --> 05:07:41,680
This way, please.

4350
05:07:41,680 --> 05:07:42,159
This way.

4351
05:07:42,159 --> 05:07:42,799
Excuse me.

4352
05:07:43,529 --> 05:07:43,930
Yep.

4353
05:07:43,930 --> 05:07:44,490
You're fine.

4354
05:07:45,130 --> 05:07:46,090
Oh, my god.

4355
05:07:48,700 --> 05:07:49,020
Okay.

4356
05:07:49,020 --> 05:07:49,580
Go home.

4357
05:07:49,580 --> 05:07:50,459
How do I tell you to go home?

4358
05:07:51,180 --> 05:07:59,959
All right.

4359
05:07:59,959 --> 05:08:00,200
Go.

4360
05:08:00,200 --> 05:08:01,080
Dismiss.

4361
05:08:01,080 --> 05:08:01,319
Go.

4362
05:08:01,880 --> 05:08:03,759
Dismiss.

4363
05:08:10,330 --> 05:08:10,810
Dismiss.

4364
05:08:20,139 --> 05:08:20,459
You're not...

4365
05:08:20,459 --> 05:08:21,099
Okay.

4366
05:08:21,099 --> 05:08:21,340
Don't...

4367
05:08:22,599 --> 05:08:25,659
Why are you going this way?

4368
05:08:25,659 --> 05:08:26,060
Okay.

4369
05:08:26,060 --> 05:08:26,619
Thank god.

4370
05:08:27,180 --> 05:08:30,479
All right.

4371
05:08:30,479 --> 05:08:31,200
We're good.

4372
05:08:31,200 --> 05:08:43,930
Let's go.

4373
05:08:52,889 --> 05:08:53,689
Where are you going?

4374
05:08:55,709 --> 05:08:56,189
Honey.

4375
05:08:56,189 --> 05:08:56,590
Honey.

4376
05:08:56,590 --> 05:08:57,709
You need to go the other way.

4377
05:08:57,709 --> 05:08:58,509
Oh, my god.

4378
05:08:58,509 --> 05:08:59,869
She's fucking so stupid.

4379
05:09:01,689 --> 05:09:02,090
Get.

4380
05:09:02,090 --> 05:09:02,810
Dismiss.

4381
05:09:02,810 --> 05:09:03,209
Dismiss.

4382
05:09:03,209 --> 05:09:03,689
Dismiss.

4383
05:09:03,689 --> 05:09:04,490
Dismiss.

4384
05:09:04,490 --> 05:09:04,970
Dismiss.

4385
05:09:04,970 --> 05:09:05,770
Dismiss.

4386
05:09:05,770 --> 05:09:06,009
Yes.

4387
05:09:06,009 --> 05:09:06,569
You're going...

4388
05:09:06,569 --> 05:09:07,610
Do you see what's happening over here?

4389
05:09:09,770 --> 05:09:10,810
Not a good place to run.

4390
05:09:11,529 --> 05:09:12,330
Don't come over here.

4391
05:09:13,130 --> 05:09:15,229
Okay.

4392
05:09:15,229 --> 05:09:15,470
Good.

4393
05:09:16,110 --> 05:09:26,029
Oh, shit.

4394
05:09:26,590 --> 05:09:29,610
Oh, my god.

4395
05:09:29,610 --> 05:09:30,330
Honey, I'm gonna die.

4396
05:09:36,200 --> 05:09:37,240
I'm gonna run this way.

4397
05:09:40,009 --> 05:09:40,569
New plan.

4398
05:09:40,569 --> 05:09:41,049
New plan.

4399
05:09:41,049 --> 05:09:41,290
Run.

4400
05:09:41,849 --> 05:10:07,500
What are you doing?

4401
05:10:07,500 --> 05:10:08,380
I lost the game.

4402
05:10:08,380 --> 05:10:09,500
I did not lose the game.

4403
05:10:09,500 --> 05:10:09,900
I'm fine.

4404
05:10:10,540 --> 05:10:26,889
What do you even do in this game?

4405
05:10:29,200 --> 05:10:30,400
Kind of a combination of everything.

4406
05:10:34,250 --> 05:10:34,970
Nice.

4407
05:10:34,970 --> 05:10:35,369
In the head.

4408
05:10:38,299 --> 05:10:38,619
Nice.

4409
05:10:38,619 --> 05:10:39,020
All right.

4410
05:10:39,020 --> 05:10:39,259
Good.

4411
05:10:39,900 --> 05:10:42,880
You know, I'm going back to lightning.

4412
05:10:46,889 --> 05:10:48,090
I think she's still following me.

4413
05:10:51,500 --> 05:11:11,069
Okay.

4414
05:11:11,869 --> 05:11:13,950
I guess you're just gonna keep following me,

4415
05:11:13,950 --> 05:11:20,110
so might as well let you just follow.

4416
05:11:20,110 --> 05:11:22,479
Here we go.

4417
05:11:22,479 --> 05:11:23,360
I'm back.

4418
05:11:23,360 --> 05:11:24,240
And I was a dick.

4419
05:11:50,220 --> 05:11:51,580
Treat her well, will you?

4420
05:11:52,139 --> 05:11:57,310
Or I'll be back to her.

4421
05:11:57,310 --> 05:11:58,029
Wait.

4422
05:11:58,029 --> 05:11:58,830
What does that part mean?

4423
05:12:07,790 --> 05:12:09,470
He takes a step away and comes right back.

4424
05:12:09,470 --> 05:12:09,970
Oh.

4425
05:12:11,819 --> 05:12:16,319
Well, that didn't take very long.

4426
05:12:16,880 --> 05:12:20,650
Beware the ghost.

4427
05:12:24,409 --> 05:12:24,729
All right.

4428
05:12:24,729 --> 05:12:25,930
That's 100 renown.

4429
05:12:25,930 --> 05:12:27,950
Is she still here?

4430
05:12:27,950 --> 05:12:29,310
If she's still here, then we can probably leave.

4431
05:12:29,950 --> 05:12:33,979
Are you still here?

4432
05:12:37,130 --> 05:12:37,770
I think she left.

4433
05:12:41,959 --> 05:12:42,520
Okay.

4434
05:12:42,520 --> 05:12:44,599
Now I have to go back to that town

4435
05:12:44,599 --> 05:12:47,560
and then travel with her to the other house.

4436
05:12:48,360 --> 05:12:54,939
She's dead?

4437
05:12:54,939 --> 05:12:55,740
What do you mean she died?

4438
05:12:55,740 --> 05:12:56,380
What are you talking about?

4439
05:12:58,279 --> 05:13:05,849
Where?

4440
05:13:05,849 --> 05:13:07,209
Probably one shooting at you.

4441
05:13:16,159 --> 05:13:16,639
Okay.

4442
05:13:16,639 --> 05:13:17,439
Well, let's go.

4443
05:13:18,240 --> 05:13:20,080
That is a gigantic quest marker.

4444
05:13:26,250 --> 05:13:26,889
The sculptor.

4445
05:13:30,520 --> 05:13:31,639
I want to go back to...

4446
05:13:31,639 --> 05:13:31,959
What is it?

4447
05:13:31,959 --> 05:13:32,439
Bowerstone?

4448
05:13:33,080 --> 05:13:46,590
The girl that died.

4449
05:13:47,709 --> 05:13:48,349
One of them died.

4450
05:13:49,310 --> 05:13:52,479
I have to get the kiss book, you're right.

4451
05:13:52,479 --> 05:13:58,599
I don't think they both died.

4452
05:13:58,599 --> 05:13:59,639
I sent one of them back, remember?

4453
05:14:08,750 --> 05:14:09,630
What's going on in the house?

4454
05:14:11,000 --> 05:14:12,040
I've been gone for a little while.

4455
05:14:14,400 --> 05:14:14,900
Hello?

4456
05:14:17,840 --> 05:14:21,009
Okay.

4457
05:14:21,549 --> 05:14:30,159
Where is he?

4458
05:14:30,479 --> 05:14:33,630
Where is he?

4459
05:14:33,630 --> 05:14:37,709
Where'd he go?

4460
05:15:02,619 --> 05:15:03,419
Put the gun down.

4461
05:15:04,060 --> 05:15:05,229
Hello?

4462
05:15:06,110 --> 05:15:06,909
What's your name?

4463
05:15:06,909 --> 05:15:08,490
Hello, Amy?

4464
05:15:08,490 --> 05:15:11,930
I thought I had a loot.

4465
05:15:11,930 --> 05:15:13,560
I swear to God, I had a loot.

4466
05:15:33,229 --> 05:15:33,549
What are you...

4467
05:15:33,549 --> 05:15:47,520
I mean, who am I even doing that to?

4468
05:15:49,200 --> 05:15:50,880
Just anyone in the area?

4469
05:15:50,880 --> 05:15:58,380
Am I doing it in the mirror?

4470
05:16:07,560 --> 05:16:16,400
All right, where's the kiss book?

4471
05:16:16,479 --> 05:16:24,560
Onion!

4472
05:16:24,560 --> 05:16:25,520
Onion!

4473
05:16:25,520 --> 05:16:26,080
Onion!

4474
05:16:36,110 --> 05:16:37,790
All right, I need to pick a new quest.

4475
05:16:37,790 --> 05:16:39,419
I have to go visit...

4476
05:16:40,060 --> 05:16:41,340
No, where's this other person?

4477
05:16:41,340 --> 05:16:41,900
Where's the other...

4478
05:16:41,900 --> 05:16:43,020
Where'd the other little girl go?

4479
05:16:43,020 --> 05:16:43,580
The other lady.

4480
05:16:45,919 --> 05:16:46,560
What?

4481
05:16:46,560 --> 05:16:57,790
The other person died?

4482
05:16:59,279 --> 05:17:00,880
Okay, well, I need to go back to my other house

4483
05:17:00,880 --> 05:17:03,279
and see how my other, like, family's doing.

4484
05:17:03,279 --> 05:17:07,150
Right?

4485
05:17:07,150 --> 05:17:10,779
Like, I need to see the families, too.

4486
05:17:11,819 --> 05:17:13,099
Alex is unhappy.

4487
05:17:13,900 --> 05:17:15,900
Gwyneth, your family has a gift for you.

4488
05:17:36,240 --> 05:17:37,680
Holy shit, you ever gonna play the game?

4489
05:17:39,319 --> 05:17:39,959
Oh, that's right.

4490
05:17:41,099 --> 05:17:43,099
I did the ghost quest.

4491
05:17:43,099 --> 05:17:43,580
That was...

4492
05:17:43,580 --> 05:17:45,659
That whole thing was the ghost story line.

4493
05:17:46,220 --> 05:17:55,770
All right, let's see how this family's doing.

4494
05:17:58,569 --> 05:17:59,290
All right, family.

4495
05:18:03,290 --> 05:18:03,849
Dad's back.

4496
05:18:08,750 --> 05:18:09,310
I'm back.

4497
05:18:09,869 --> 05:18:10,990
I'm here to chop wood.

4498
05:18:12,349 --> 05:18:13,150
Watch football.

4499
05:18:17,279 --> 05:18:18,000
Hello, honey!

4500
05:18:26,810 --> 05:18:27,209
Thank you.

4501
05:18:40,959 --> 05:18:43,040
Oh, it was little baby Kieran.

4502
05:18:43,040 --> 05:18:45,680
Right, Kieran is the baby's name.

4503
05:18:45,680 --> 05:18:54,110
Right.

4504
05:18:54,110 --> 05:18:55,069
Kiernan.

4505
05:18:55,069 --> 05:19:03,200
I said it wrong.

4506
05:19:03,200 --> 05:19:09,200
Okay, we're good.

4507
05:19:09,200 --> 05:19:10,720
Now let's do the quest.

4508
05:19:10,720 --> 05:19:13,840
The ritual.

4509
05:19:13,840 --> 05:19:17,319
Walk to the Abbot in Oakfield and press the Abbot by earning Renown.

4510
05:19:17,319 --> 05:19:19,049
How much Renown do I need?

4511
05:19:19,049 --> 05:19:20,909
I'll return to the Abbot.

4512
05:19:20,909 --> 05:19:38,939
Okay.

4513
05:19:38,939 --> 05:19:40,299
I'm pretty famous now.

4514
05:19:40,299 --> 05:19:42,380
I think you'd let me do whatever you wanted.

4515
05:19:42,380 --> 05:19:43,180
What was I supposed to do?

4516
05:19:55,680 --> 05:19:57,200
Walk with me a while.

4517
05:19:57,200 --> 05:20:08,459
What the fuck are you doing?

4518
05:20:09,180 --> 05:20:14,090
I'm sorry, you're very large.

4519
05:20:41,840 --> 05:20:42,799
Second monk.

4520
05:20:42,799 --> 05:20:45,439
I have chosen to send a protector for the first.

4521
05:20:46,080 --> 05:20:47,200
And that's you.

4522
05:20:47,200 --> 05:20:48,159
If you're interested.

4523
05:20:49,520 --> 05:20:51,919
The cave is just at the end of this road.

4524
05:20:51,919 --> 05:20:53,919
You have to talk louder when it's your waterfall, dude.

4525
05:20:56,840 --> 05:20:58,759
You probably passed it on your way here.

4526
05:21:00,009 --> 05:21:02,729
Our strongest monk will be waiting for you when you're ready.

4527
05:21:07,869 --> 05:21:08,189
All right.

4528
05:21:08,189 --> 05:21:08,669
Are you the...

4529
05:21:10,110 --> 05:21:11,069
Are you the monk?

4530
05:21:13,000 --> 05:21:14,759
Even if they do not yet realize it.

4531
05:21:16,409 --> 05:21:17,290
Benjamin the monk.

4532
05:21:37,290 --> 05:21:38,009
Easy game.

4533
05:21:38,009 --> 05:21:38,569
Just dance.

4534
05:21:38,569 --> 05:21:39,049
That's all right.

4535
05:21:39,770 --> 05:21:56,459
What are you...

4536
05:21:56,459 --> 05:21:58,110
Honey, what are you doing?

4537
05:21:58,110 --> 05:22:00,029
Wait, what is he doing out here?

4538
05:22:00,029 --> 05:22:01,229
What the fuck is going on?

4539
05:22:01,229 --> 05:22:02,349
Why are you out here?

4540
05:22:03,069 --> 05:22:03,389
What?

4541
05:22:04,029 --> 05:22:08,430
I'm so confused.

4542
05:22:09,069 --> 05:22:16,759
Who is that?

4543
05:22:16,759 --> 05:22:17,080
Is that...

4544
05:22:24,830 --> 05:22:30,959
What?

4545
05:22:49,450 --> 05:22:52,970
What if we kissed at the demon door?

4546
05:22:59,770 --> 05:23:04,349
Hey there, boy.

4547
05:23:04,349 --> 05:23:05,150
Hello.

4548
05:23:05,150 --> 05:23:08,650
Oh, you're a strong, handsome fellow, aren't you?

4549
05:23:09,450 --> 05:23:13,080
I feel better having you with me in that cave.

4550
05:23:13,080 --> 05:23:13,880
Yes, I will.

4551
05:23:16,110 --> 05:23:16,509
I feel...

4552
05:23:16,509 --> 05:23:17,310
Are we related?

4553
05:23:17,869 --> 05:23:18,590
I feel like...

4554
05:23:18,590 --> 05:23:19,630
I feel like we're related.

4555
05:23:19,630 --> 05:23:20,590
We, like, look alike.

4556
05:23:21,470 --> 05:23:22,349
We have the same face.

4557
05:23:23,229 --> 05:23:29,639
You solemn vow never to bash anyone's face in.

4558
05:23:29,639 --> 05:23:31,680
Did my father mention that?

4559
05:23:32,479 --> 05:23:33,279
Yeah.

4560
05:23:33,279 --> 05:23:37,130
Whatever fighting's to be done in there, it's all yours.

4561
05:23:37,130 --> 05:23:37,849
I have to do all the fighting?

4562
05:23:37,849 --> 05:23:40,490
We require a hero, not a pacifist monk.

4563
05:23:43,200 --> 05:23:45,680
We'll need her to find a reason to fight.

4564
05:23:45,680 --> 05:23:50,479
I don't mind telling you, I'm a bit envious.

4565
05:23:51,119 --> 05:23:56,279
All the excitement that I get to carry this bloody thing like some sort of new.

4566
05:23:56,279 --> 05:23:58,560
I mean, look at it.

4567
05:23:58,560 --> 05:23:59,520
It's enormous.

4568
05:24:00,759 --> 05:24:03,799
Golden or not, how much water does a bloody acorn need?

4569
05:24:03,799 --> 05:24:04,360
I love...

4570
05:24:04,360 --> 05:24:05,560
I love water.

4571
05:24:05,560 --> 05:24:07,000
I love water.

4572
05:24:07,720 --> 05:24:10,779
I like how, like, American English...

4573
05:24:10,779 --> 05:24:11,259
Water.

4574
05:24:11,979 --> 05:24:12,380
Water.

4575
05:24:13,099 --> 05:24:13,819
Water.

4576
05:24:13,819 --> 05:24:15,180
Does that sound nicer?

4577
05:24:16,700 --> 05:24:17,880
Water.

4578
05:24:17,880 --> 05:24:18,520
Water.

4579
05:24:18,599 --> 05:24:32,959
All Americans are from Boston.

4580
05:24:32,959 --> 05:24:36,299
Well, I said water and then I said water.

4581
05:24:36,299 --> 05:24:37,099
I said water.

4582
05:24:50,270 --> 05:24:51,470
Don't worry, I've got an axe.

4583
05:24:59,770 --> 05:25:01,130
How much longer am I going to scream for?

4584
05:25:02,409 --> 05:25:04,650
Um, what do I just do?

4585
05:25:04,650 --> 05:25:05,849
I just drank something for no reason.

4586
05:25:08,009 --> 05:25:14,299
Where's the dog?

4587
05:25:14,299 --> 05:25:14,939
Am I puking?

4588
05:25:14,939 --> 05:25:15,580
What's wrong with me?

4589
05:25:23,389 --> 05:26:00,520
I don't push or I'll split.

4590
05:26:00,520 --> 05:26:00,840
Sorry.

4591
05:26:03,259 --> 05:26:04,220
Violence.

4592
05:26:04,220 --> 05:26:04,700
Violence.

4593
05:26:05,500 --> 05:26:05,900
Violence.

4594
05:26:29,819 --> 05:26:30,459
What's that?

4595
05:26:30,459 --> 05:26:42,029
Uh-oh.

4596
05:26:47,159 --> 05:26:47,959
Stay on guard.

4597
05:27:02,619 --> 05:27:03,099
Open it up.

4598
05:27:03,900 --> 05:27:07,290
Stand on that and now I'll get in.

4599
05:27:17,680 --> 05:27:20,080
Fable one, fable two, fable three, three, three, fable three,

4600
05:27:20,080 --> 05:27:21,520
fable two, fable three, three, three.

4601
05:27:22,159 --> 05:27:28,880
Is Diablo 2, uh, remake out yet?

4602
05:27:28,880 --> 05:27:40,159
I wish.

4603
05:27:40,720 --> 05:27:48,889
Yeah, oh, say it again.

4604
05:27:50,250 --> 05:27:50,650
Water.

4605
05:27:51,290 --> 05:27:51,610
Water.

4606
05:28:06,349 --> 05:28:07,389
I-I-I get it.

4607
05:28:21,159 --> 05:28:23,319
Is your character portrayed by John Candy?

4608
05:28:24,200 --> 05:28:24,680
That's it.

4609
05:28:25,479 --> 05:28:28,840
I really hope they find someone else to do this next time.

4610
05:28:30,119 --> 05:28:33,159
Mind you, I'll be an old lady by then, so I'm probably off the hook.

4611
05:28:34,680 --> 05:28:39,400
You know, this is probably going to be the highlight of my life.

4612
05:28:39,400 --> 05:28:42,040
The day I carried a jug through a cave.

4613
05:28:43,240 --> 05:28:46,860
Shit, give me that.

4614
05:28:46,860 --> 05:28:47,819
Did you hear something?

4615
05:28:49,180 --> 05:28:51,819
No, probably just my imagination.

4616
05:28:55,119 --> 05:28:56,400
Don't talk much, do you?

4617
05:28:57,279 --> 05:28:58,159
You did hear something.

4618
05:28:58,799 --> 05:29:03,180
Right, I reckon that's all the water we're going to get from this one.

4619
05:29:07,520 --> 05:29:08,799
Oh, a silver key.

4620
05:29:09,599 --> 05:29:16,090
Oh my god, you guys, did you farted?

4621
05:29:16,090 --> 05:29:17,740
Did you hear that he farted?

4622
05:29:31,900 --> 05:29:33,900
Fuck, I didn't even test to see if the audio was synced.

4623
05:29:34,700 --> 05:29:38,060
I didn't even test to see if the audio was synced this entire game.

4624
05:29:44,759 --> 05:29:45,400
God damn it.

4625
05:29:45,959 --> 05:29:46,680
I need to test this.

4626
05:29:47,240 --> 05:29:49,080
Okay, ready?

4627
05:29:49,080 --> 05:29:55,419
Down, down, down.

4628
05:29:55,419 --> 05:29:56,220
Is it synced?

4629
05:29:56,220 --> 05:30:06,299
Is it major desync?

4630
05:30:06,299 --> 05:30:07,020
Is it close enough?

4631
05:30:07,580 --> 05:30:12,459
It's like one and a half seconds off, delayed by like 0.6 seconds.

4632
05:30:12,459 --> 05:30:18,119
Down, down, down.

4633
05:30:18,119 --> 05:30:19,080
Why one second?

4634
05:30:19,639 --> 05:30:26,009
Okay, so do you hear me first?

4635
05:30:26,009 --> 05:30:26,650
Do you hear the game?

4636
05:30:27,930 --> 05:30:28,810
What happens first?

4637
05:30:28,810 --> 05:30:34,650
How about this now?

4638
05:30:34,650 --> 05:30:35,450
How about ready?

4639
05:30:35,450 --> 05:30:38,619
Up, down, down.

4640
05:30:39,259 --> 05:31:03,209
Up, down, down.

4641
05:31:03,209 --> 05:31:08,509
Let's go.

4642
05:31:08,509 --> 05:31:11,709
Super, Superman.

4643
05:31:12,430 --> 05:31:23,799
Oh shit, people are giving me a ton of fucking subs.

4644
05:31:23,799 --> 05:31:25,479
I haven't even been paying attention, I'm sorry.

4645
05:31:25,479 --> 05:31:32,569
Oh no, somebody said it.

4646
05:31:32,569 --> 05:31:33,209
I have to say it now.

4647
05:31:34,009 --> 05:31:34,509
Ah.

4648
05:31:34,970 --> 05:31:35,610
Okay, I'll do it.

4649
05:31:36,639 --> 05:31:37,200
Gabi J!

4650
05:31:38,400 --> 05:31:38,900
Yay!

4651
05:31:39,439 --> 05:31:45,389
I just ate a bunch of fucking rotten pies.

4652
05:31:59,520 --> 05:32:03,340
It was like, I like this game, but it's kind of really fucking annoying.

4653
05:32:04,220 --> 05:32:07,259
That, like it might look like very simple on the screen,

4654
05:32:07,259 --> 05:32:11,259
but every time to do a spell I have to go up, up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down, down.

4655
05:32:11,259 --> 05:32:14,380
Hey, it's like Mortal Kombat, it's fucking so annoying.

4656
05:32:15,020 --> 05:32:28,080
Spells in this game suck.

4657
05:32:28,080 --> 05:32:30,959
Why'd you tell me that 71% of you told me to be a magician?

4658
05:32:48,799 --> 05:32:49,439
Behind you!

4659
05:32:51,360 --> 05:32:51,860
Wait, what?

4660
05:33:01,869 --> 05:33:05,599
I think the gifted subs.

4661
05:33:06,720 --> 05:33:07,919
Thank you, thank you.

4662
05:33:10,880 --> 05:33:11,200
Thank you.

4663
05:33:14,840 --> 05:33:15,240
Thank you.

4664
05:33:19,400 --> 05:33:21,080
Thank you, Val.

4665
05:33:21,080 --> 05:33:21,639
I appreciate it.

4666
05:33:29,880 --> 05:33:30,599
Thank you, Val.

4667
05:33:31,610 --> 05:33:33,930
Thank you, Balsin, for the 20 community subs.

4668
05:33:36,939 --> 05:33:46,400
Thank you, Chef Lazarus, for the 10 subs.

4669
05:33:47,599 --> 05:33:49,599
You unite your workplace, thanks for 20 community subs.

4670
05:33:50,400 --> 05:33:50,900
Thanks a lot, guys.

4671
05:33:54,590 --> 05:33:55,310
It's not their name.

4672
05:33:56,509 --> 05:33:59,880
Their name is Balsin.

4673
05:34:00,439 --> 05:34:05,130
I'm gonna stand up here and use my fucking magical tune.

4674
05:34:19,639 --> 05:34:22,439
Oh, the bard who plays magical tune.

4675
05:34:22,439 --> 05:34:33,049
I don't know, I kind of feel like Connect Dad right now, I'm not gonna lie.

4676
05:34:59,790 --> 05:35:03,259
Easy, game's easy.

4677
05:35:03,259 --> 05:35:27,560
Get the blade spell, maybe next time.

4678
05:35:27,560 --> 05:35:37,610
Oh, let me come down there and help you.

4679
05:35:37,610 --> 05:35:48,060
Are they gonna kill her?

4680
05:35:48,060 --> 05:35:53,900
How do you miss point blank?

4681
05:35:56,400 --> 05:36:00,000
I can turn safety off and kill her?

4682
05:36:00,000 --> 05:36:04,159
What?

4683
05:36:04,159 --> 05:36:04,639
Toughness.

4684
05:36:06,319 --> 05:36:11,689
Hold on, they get a shock three.

4685
05:36:15,389 --> 05:36:16,430
Blades.

4686
05:36:16,430 --> 05:36:19,369
Let's do blades.

4687
05:36:20,110 --> 05:36:28,720
Blades one and blades two.

4688
05:36:28,720 --> 05:36:38,000
And let's also do speed.

4689
05:36:38,000 --> 05:36:42,520
Blades are broken.

4690
05:36:43,319 --> 05:36:45,930
Oh, nice.

4691
05:36:47,580 --> 05:36:49,259
Low level spells are now more powerful.

4692
05:36:49,979 --> 05:36:51,770
All right, what do we got here?

4693
05:36:51,770 --> 05:36:54,110
Let's do blades two.

4694
05:37:00,279 --> 05:37:01,080
Oh, shit, okay.

4695
05:37:01,720 --> 05:37:05,759
Holy shit, that's cool.

4696
05:37:05,759 --> 05:37:06,720
All right, so should I keep...

4697
05:37:07,439 --> 05:37:13,229
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

4698
05:37:13,229 --> 05:37:14,349
Oh, that's awesome.

4699
05:37:15,069 --> 05:37:18,540
All right, blades one and vortex two.

4700
05:37:18,540 --> 05:37:20,060
So I'll vortex two everybody.

4701
05:37:20,860 --> 05:37:22,619
And then we'll drop fucking blades everywhere.

4702
05:37:39,419 --> 05:37:40,939
Yes, I'm always ready.

4703
05:37:41,580 --> 05:37:50,319
Turn safety off.

4704
05:37:50,319 --> 05:37:55,919
Uh-oh.

4705
05:38:02,090 --> 05:38:03,290
Just unlearn chaos.

4706
05:38:05,770 --> 05:38:08,650
Chaos three or chaos five is probably really good.

4707
05:38:08,650 --> 05:38:13,950
He's back.

4708
05:38:13,950 --> 05:38:15,360
Here he comes.

4709
05:38:19,340 --> 05:38:20,779
Dina, what'd you find?

4710
05:38:20,779 --> 05:38:22,459
Oh, God.

4711
05:38:41,240 --> 05:38:44,380
Horse pose is cheap and OP.

4712
05:38:46,779 --> 05:38:47,790
I'll check it out.

4713
05:38:55,069 --> 05:38:56,459
I have her boss, right?

4714
05:39:10,250 --> 05:39:15,790
Yeah, this is awesome.

4715
05:39:16,430 --> 05:39:17,470
Why did I not just...

4716
05:39:17,470 --> 05:39:19,229
Okay, why would I ever use another move?

4717
05:39:19,950 --> 05:39:22,619
Why would I ever use another move?

4718
05:39:23,259 --> 05:39:33,549
Bro, I've been trying to tell you.

4719
05:39:33,549 --> 05:39:35,069
Yeah, I know, but still.

4720
05:39:35,790 --> 05:39:38,880
I need to level up like strength.

4721
05:39:39,439 --> 05:39:40,560
We have to get strength up.

4722
05:39:41,119 --> 05:39:46,459
Does any more health?

4723
05:39:46,459 --> 05:39:58,250
This health bar is so awful.

4724
05:39:58,250 --> 05:39:59,049
Sick.

4725
05:39:59,049 --> 05:40:07,770
Okay, I played Fable three or maybe like an hour or two, three hours or so.

4726
05:40:07,770 --> 05:40:09,450
And I thought it was absolute dog shit.

4727
05:40:10,330 --> 05:40:13,610
Am I misremembering this or did I just get bored of the franchise or something?

4728
05:40:13,610 --> 05:40:14,650
I remember not being good.

4729
05:40:14,650 --> 05:40:15,290
Should I play it?

4730
05:40:22,779 --> 05:40:24,380
No, it does suck.

4731
05:40:24,380 --> 05:40:28,779
Headless Hollow Man.

4732
05:40:28,779 --> 05:40:31,630
You have enough experience to buy something.

4733
05:40:31,630 --> 05:40:33,630
Okay, well, why is this so hard?

4734
05:40:34,669 --> 05:40:38,279
He's like the easiest enemy in the whole game.

4735
05:40:38,279 --> 05:40:39,000
Why is this like...

4736
05:40:39,000 --> 05:40:40,040
Why does he have his own cut scene?

4737
05:40:41,240 --> 05:40:43,159
The guy can't even see us.

4738
05:40:43,159 --> 05:41:05,659
That was a boss?

4739
05:41:05,659 --> 05:41:11,849
He was the worst one, but it was still...

4740
05:41:11,849 --> 05:41:12,490
I still liked it.

4741
05:41:18,060 --> 05:41:25,229
Fable three is still worth playing.

4742
05:41:26,029 --> 05:41:27,950
Yeah, I just didn't...

4743
05:41:27,950 --> 05:41:30,270
They added like a follower system or something, right?

4744
05:41:30,270 --> 05:41:33,950
Where you could open chests if you had a thousand followers,

4745
05:41:33,950 --> 05:41:36,590
2,000 followers, 10,000 followers, something weird like that.

4746
05:41:38,349 --> 05:41:38,909
No, it isn't.

4747
05:41:39,630 --> 05:41:40,189
What am I...

4748
05:41:40,189 --> 05:41:40,990
I'm...

4749
05:41:40,990 --> 05:41:41,630
That happens.

4750
05:41:52,680 --> 05:41:53,880
That's the level system.

4751
05:42:10,479 --> 05:42:14,720
The monks are evil.

4752
05:42:24,380 --> 05:42:25,720
I got one too.

4753
05:42:25,720 --> 05:42:26,119
Let's go.

4754
05:42:29,950 --> 05:42:31,389
I wish I could run faster.

4755
05:42:41,599 --> 05:42:44,560
Thank you, Balsin again for the 20 community subs this time.

4756
05:42:44,560 --> 05:42:45,599
Thank you, Balsin.

4757
05:42:45,599 --> 05:43:04,700
Fable one is the only one that's worth playing.

4758
05:43:06,060 --> 05:43:07,020
I think this one's good.

4759
05:43:09,310 --> 05:43:12,750
This is a good game, but if you played this when it came out...

4760
05:43:15,759 --> 05:43:18,080
This game promised so many things.

4761
05:43:18,959 --> 05:43:23,919
I remember looking at developer commentaries and hype videos about this game.

4762
05:43:23,919 --> 05:43:28,319
Everyone thought this was going to be like the world's greatest video game.

4763
05:43:32,560 --> 05:43:37,200
There was going to be like an entire living, breathing earth in this game.

4764
05:43:37,919 --> 05:43:42,700
And it ended up being like a 12 and a half to like 14 hour action game

4765
05:43:43,259 --> 05:43:44,939
that had like a marriage system.

4766
05:43:47,130 --> 05:43:49,130
It was not that big of a deal.

4767
05:43:49,130 --> 05:43:51,209
I remember watching a video of like...

4768
05:43:51,209 --> 05:43:52,009
Holy shit dog.

4769
05:43:52,009 --> 05:43:55,049
I remember watching videos of like Peter Molyneux talking about

4770
05:43:55,849 --> 05:44:00,970
if you plant this tree here, it will grow and you could have a forest.

4771
05:44:01,770 --> 05:44:06,650
And I think there's one cutscene that happens in the course of this entire like 15 hour experience

4772
05:44:06,650 --> 05:44:09,130
where like trees grow in a cutscene.

4773
05:44:09,770 --> 05:44:15,639
And that's it.

4774
05:44:15,639 --> 05:44:19,869
That was Fable one.

4775
05:44:19,869 --> 05:44:22,189
No, it was definitely Fable two because Fable one was good,

4776
05:44:22,189 --> 05:44:26,700
but he didn't have time to really hype it up like he did.

4777
05:44:33,869 --> 05:44:34,669
Wait, who's talking?

4778
05:44:39,819 --> 05:44:41,659
Why I'm missing important shit.

4779
05:44:41,659 --> 05:44:42,540
Where is this person?

4780
05:44:43,819 --> 05:44:44,700
Oh, God damn it.

4781
05:44:44,700 --> 05:44:45,740
I missed an entire thing.

4782
05:44:45,740 --> 05:44:46,380
Where are they?

4783
05:45:00,889 --> 05:45:02,090
He hyped it up the same way.

4784
05:45:03,720 --> 05:45:06,520
Yeah, but I remember thinking Fable two was going to be the world's...

4785
05:45:20,380 --> 05:45:21,259
I missed that too.

4786
05:45:21,259 --> 05:45:22,700
World's worst cameraman.

4787
05:45:22,700 --> 05:45:23,419
Oh my God.

4788
05:45:57,849 --> 05:45:58,810
I'm sorry, father.

4789
05:46:00,409 --> 05:46:01,529
Not that I broke my vow.

4790
05:46:02,569 --> 05:46:04,330
I'm sorry I didn't break it sooner.

4791
05:46:04,330 --> 05:46:04,830
What is this?

4792
05:46:05,450 --> 05:46:06,970
I never did fit in at this place.

4793
05:46:07,849 --> 05:46:08,810
We both knew that.

4794
05:46:09,900 --> 05:46:11,500
And now I'm making a new vow.

4795
05:46:12,380 --> 05:46:14,459
Lucian would die for what he did to you.

4796
05:46:15,630 --> 05:46:17,310
I won't break this one.

4797
05:46:17,310 --> 05:46:21,229
Why am I doing like the you put another t-shirt on in The Sims character creator?

4798
05:46:24,990 --> 05:46:29,080
As new life rises, so shall we.

4799
05:46:30,139 --> 05:46:35,279
As the seed returns to the earth, so do we all.

4800
05:46:35,279 --> 05:46:36,560
No, don't step on it.

4801
05:46:36,560 --> 05:46:37,759
I'm trying to move.

4802
05:46:37,759 --> 05:46:39,279
Okay, there's like an invisible wall right here

4803
05:46:39,279 --> 05:46:40,959
and it just fucked me up and I walked on it.

4804
05:46:40,959 --> 05:46:41,840
I didn't mean to do that.

4805
05:46:41,840 --> 05:46:42,720
I swear to God.

4806
05:46:42,720 --> 05:46:45,209
There's an invisible wall right here

4807
05:46:45,209 --> 05:46:48,169
and it like blocked me and fucked me up and I walked over here.

4808
05:46:49,610 --> 05:46:50,990
There's an invisible wall.

4809
05:46:50,990 --> 05:46:52,110
Look, I'm proving it right now.

4810
05:46:52,110 --> 05:47:23,150
I can't.

4811
05:47:23,150 --> 05:47:23,869
There's no farting.

4812
05:47:23,869 --> 05:47:24,430
I can't do anything.

4813
05:47:30,569 --> 05:47:31,610
I was in Renan.

4814
05:47:31,610 --> 05:47:32,250
Holy shit.

4815
05:47:43,290 --> 05:47:45,529
Cool.

4816
05:47:54,840 --> 05:47:55,639
I'm not going to fart.

4817
05:47:55,639 --> 05:47:57,479
That's no, I have to.

4818
05:47:57,479 --> 05:47:58,360
I'm not doing that.

4819
05:47:58,360 --> 05:47:59,080
That's not nice.

4820
05:47:59,799 --> 05:48:01,080
That's not a good boy move.

4821
05:48:11,930 --> 05:48:15,599
You know, so this game was cool.

4822
05:48:16,639 --> 05:48:17,599
I think Dark Souls.

4823
05:48:19,439 --> 05:48:22,240
Games like Dark, especially just when Dark Souls came out.

4824
05:48:22,240 --> 05:48:25,680
That like changed everything about how like an action adventure

4825
05:48:25,680 --> 05:48:28,560
melee kind of spell game was played.

4826
05:48:29,680 --> 05:48:31,919
Man, would I love a game that has this kind of

4827
05:48:32,880 --> 05:48:41,680
able to like world and systems, but Dark Souls level of game kind of mechanics.

4828
05:48:46,409 --> 05:48:49,930
Imagine a game that has like the world with all these like different like

4829
05:48:50,569 --> 05:48:52,990
permanently being able to kill people and

4830
05:48:53,709 --> 05:48:56,669
the quests and stuff, but it's like Dark Souls.

4831
05:49:00,319 --> 05:49:02,479
I would love like a fable slash Dark Souls.

4832
05:49:03,279 --> 05:49:03,840
I would love it.

4833
05:49:04,400 --> 05:49:11,599
Isn't this my house?

4834
05:49:12,909 --> 05:49:13,630
Holy shit.

4835
05:49:13,630 --> 05:49:14,430
I'm so sorry.

4836
05:49:14,430 --> 05:49:15,229
Oh my God.

4837
05:49:24,799 --> 05:49:25,919
I got to get out of town quick.

4838
05:49:29,930 --> 05:49:30,490
Wait, hold on.

4839
05:49:30,490 --> 05:49:31,209
What's?

4840
05:49:31,209 --> 05:49:34,220
Oh, they're out while they're out while they're out.

4841
05:49:34,220 --> 05:49:37,659
Just steal everything quick.

4842
05:49:37,659 --> 05:49:38,220
No, get out.

4843
05:49:38,220 --> 05:49:39,020
Just get out.

4844
05:49:39,020 --> 05:49:40,700
No, they might have something under the bed.

4845
05:49:40,700 --> 05:49:45,360
I can buy the house.

4846
05:49:45,360 --> 05:49:45,919
I can buy the house.

4847
05:49:45,919 --> 05:49:48,240
I can buy the house first and then it's not illegal.

4848
05:49:48,240 --> 05:50:14,029
How much is this place?

4849
05:50:14,029 --> 05:50:15,150
Holy shit.

4850
05:50:15,150 --> 05:50:22,540
Macho.

4851
05:50:23,319 --> 05:50:23,959
Are you okay?

4852
05:50:32,459 --> 05:50:33,740
Swim to Mexico.

4853
05:50:34,540 --> 05:50:35,159
All right.

4854
05:50:35,159 --> 05:50:35,560
I'm good.

4855
05:50:36,119 --> 05:50:41,689
They're like bees.

4856
05:50:41,689 --> 05:50:43,130
They're not going to come in the water.

4857
05:50:43,130 --> 05:50:52,560
Oh, what are you going to do?

4858
05:50:52,560 --> 05:50:56,189
What are you going to do about it?

4859
05:50:56,189 --> 05:50:56,830
Oh, no.

4860
05:50:56,830 --> 05:50:57,470
What happened?

4861
05:50:58,400 --> 05:50:59,919
You can't come and get me in the water.

4862
05:51:08,909 --> 05:51:43,770
Is the dog going to bite him?

4863
05:51:43,770 --> 05:51:48,029
He's like, should I?

4864
05:51:48,029 --> 05:51:48,509
What should I do?

4865
05:51:48,509 --> 05:51:49,150
Should I bite him?

4866
05:51:55,849 --> 05:51:56,169
All right.

4867
05:51:56,169 --> 05:51:57,580
Bite him.

4868
05:51:57,580 --> 05:51:58,299
Bite that guy.

4869
05:51:59,659 --> 05:52:00,380
Bite that guy.

4870
05:52:00,380 --> 05:52:02,240
Bite him.

4871
05:52:02,240 --> 05:52:02,799
Bite him.

4872
05:52:02,799 --> 05:52:04,779
Bite him on the leg.

4873
05:52:04,779 --> 05:52:06,139
Bite that guy.

4874
05:52:06,139 --> 05:52:07,180
Bite him.

4875
05:52:07,180 --> 05:52:20,639
I wonder if I can get him to go in the water.

4876
05:52:21,279 --> 05:52:24,029
Will he drown if he goes in the water?

4877
05:52:44,729 --> 05:52:44,970
All right.

4878
05:52:44,970 --> 05:52:45,689
I'm going to try something.

4879
05:52:48,680 --> 05:52:49,639
They're running in circle.

4880
05:52:49,639 --> 05:52:53,209
Oh, all right.

4881
05:52:53,209 --> 05:52:53,770
All right.

4882
05:52:53,770 --> 05:52:54,330
I got to go.

4883
05:52:54,330 --> 05:52:54,729
Fuck it.

4884
05:52:58,189 --> 05:53:10,880
Where the fuck am I going?

4885
05:53:11,610 --> 05:53:12,330
Oh, shit.

4886
05:53:12,330 --> 05:53:13,369
Why am I going this way?

4887
05:53:14,330 --> 05:53:15,049
Oh, shit.

4888
05:53:15,049 --> 05:53:15,369
Oh, my God.

4889
05:53:15,369 --> 05:53:15,689
Oh, my God.

4890
05:53:15,689 --> 05:53:16,009
Oh, my God.

4891
05:53:16,009 --> 05:53:16,889
Oh, my God.

4892
05:53:16,889 --> 05:53:17,209
Oh, my God.

4893
05:53:17,209 --> 05:53:17,610
Oh, my God.

4894
05:53:17,610 --> 05:53:18,009
Oh, my God.

4895
05:53:18,009 --> 05:53:19,689
Oh, my God.

4896
05:53:19,689 --> 05:53:20,250
I just shot him.

4897
05:53:20,250 --> 05:53:20,810
I shot a guy.

4898
05:53:21,369 --> 05:53:22,009
What happened?

4899
05:53:29,919 --> 05:53:33,000
What happened?

4900
05:53:33,000 --> 05:53:33,639
Wait, what?

4901
05:53:33,639 --> 05:53:40,590
What just happened?

4902
05:53:46,060 --> 05:53:47,659
It was 200 gold?

4903
05:53:48,220 --> 05:54:02,569
Oh, all right.

4904
05:54:02,569 --> 05:54:03,369
I got to relax.

4905
05:54:08,360 --> 05:54:16,000
Relax.

4906
05:54:16,000 --> 05:54:16,400
Relax.

4907
05:54:16,400 --> 05:54:18,799
I don't want to get into like a fucking coughing fit here.

4908
05:54:23,680 --> 05:54:32,680
Imagine shooting somebody in the fucking chest twice.

4909
05:54:32,680 --> 05:54:33,799
And the guy turns around.

4910
05:54:33,799 --> 05:54:36,680
He's just like, well, you can pay me $250.

4911
05:54:40,669 --> 05:54:42,189
That's so fucking funny.

4912
05:54:43,639 --> 05:54:47,229
I can't kill him.

4913
05:54:48,569 --> 05:54:49,290
Settle down.

4914
05:54:49,290 --> 05:54:50,330
Settle down.

4915
05:54:50,330 --> 05:54:51,470
I'm going to settle down.

4916
05:54:51,470 --> 05:54:52,509
That was that was...

4917
05:54:52,509 --> 05:54:55,709
I could have started to overthink that and laugh about that.

4918
05:54:55,709 --> 05:54:56,509
I got to relax.

4919
05:55:02,299 --> 05:55:06,830
Very well.

4920
05:55:06,830 --> 05:55:09,229
You've paid your debt to society.

4921
05:55:09,229 --> 05:55:13,919
Now then, you better not be planning on using that weapon.

4922
05:55:13,919 --> 05:55:17,630
I don't even think I can kill anyone again.

4923
05:55:17,630 --> 05:55:18,909
I want to put this weapon away.

4924
05:55:18,909 --> 05:55:20,029
It's closing time.

4925
05:55:20,029 --> 05:55:22,169
Is he about to limp?

4926
05:55:23,840 --> 05:55:24,560
What the fuck?

4927
05:55:24,560 --> 05:55:24,880
Hey!

4928
05:55:25,599 --> 05:55:27,529
What's he doing?

4929
05:55:48,279 --> 05:55:49,799
Who did he shoot the gun at?

4930
05:55:49,799 --> 05:55:54,110
What's going on over here?

4931
05:55:54,110 --> 05:55:55,229
What the hell is happening?

4932
05:55:56,029 --> 05:55:59,020
Wait.

4933
05:55:59,020 --> 05:56:00,459
Oh, they were bandits.

4934
05:56:01,020 --> 05:56:02,860
Oh, they were bandits attacking.

4935
05:56:10,720 --> 05:56:12,240
Wait, why is this happening?

4936
05:56:13,389 --> 05:56:15,069
Why are there so many people?

4937
05:56:19,450 --> 05:56:20,569
What's happening?

4938
05:56:20,569 --> 05:56:21,930
I don't understand.

4939
05:56:21,930 --> 05:56:22,569
Oh, shit.

4940
05:56:23,689 --> 05:56:29,419
It's like a fucking brawl.

4941
05:56:31,209 --> 05:56:31,770
Who's dog?

4942
05:56:31,770 --> 05:56:32,650
Oh, that's my dog.

4943
05:56:41,529 --> 05:56:42,810
This is just the purge.

4944
05:56:54,590 --> 05:56:54,990
All right.

4945
05:56:54,990 --> 05:56:55,549
I'm done.

4946
05:56:55,549 --> 05:56:56,270
I'm done after this.

4947
05:56:56,270 --> 05:56:57,389
I'm getting out of here.

4948
05:56:57,389 --> 05:57:06,459
Okay.

4949
05:57:08,479 --> 05:57:09,599
Safety on.

4950
05:57:09,599 --> 05:57:15,599
I mean, the guy like literally was like,

4951
05:57:15,599 --> 05:57:17,520
ah, thanks for paying the fee, bastard.

4952
05:57:17,520 --> 05:57:20,240
And then he aimed the gun and just started firing at somebody.

4953
05:57:25,840 --> 05:57:26,880
Oh, shit.

4954
05:57:38,430 --> 05:57:39,229
He's a guard.

4955
05:57:39,229 --> 05:57:39,950
I don't know.

4956
05:57:39,950 --> 05:57:41,389
I thought he was like shooting at my dog.

4957
05:57:41,389 --> 05:57:41,709
I don't know.

4958
05:57:41,709 --> 05:57:44,750
I thought he was firing at somebody that I was connected to somehow

4959
05:57:44,750 --> 05:57:46,840
because he was like still aggro to me.

4960
05:57:46,840 --> 05:57:49,479
I thought he was still aggro to my character somehow

4961
05:57:50,040 --> 05:57:51,799
and like was shooting at the dog.

4962
05:57:51,799 --> 05:57:52,599
I don't know.

4963
05:57:52,599 --> 05:57:53,680
Okay.

4964
05:57:53,680 --> 05:57:54,080
We're good.

4965
05:57:54,720 --> 05:58:08,139
Still, I still think that's so funny.

4966
05:58:08,779 --> 05:58:11,659
Two like fucking slugs in the chest and he's just like,

4967
05:58:11,659 --> 05:58:14,380
I'll take 250 if you just want to keep walking.

4968
05:58:14,380 --> 05:58:16,860
That's got like 12 holes in his body.

4969
05:58:16,860 --> 05:58:34,569
How do I get out of here?

4970
05:58:34,569 --> 05:58:35,450
I'm sorry, your honor.

4971
05:58:35,450 --> 05:58:37,130
I thought he was still aggroed on me.

4972
05:58:38,009 --> 05:58:52,729
Your spouse is threatening divorce?

4973
05:58:52,729 --> 05:58:56,700
Where do you see that?

4974
05:59:04,599 --> 05:59:05,080
Keep walking.

4975
05:59:07,799 --> 05:59:08,520
Keep walking.

4976
05:59:08,520 --> 05:59:09,880
My reputation is already awful.

4977
05:59:11,360 --> 05:59:14,799
What's wrong?

4978
05:59:14,799 --> 05:59:16,759
What's going on?

4979
05:59:30,560 --> 05:59:31,759
I got a gift.

4980
05:59:32,319 --> 05:59:37,520
Pretty necklace.

4981
05:59:38,159 --> 05:59:46,299
We're fine.

4982
05:59:46,860 --> 05:59:50,840
And I'm going to do your favorite thing.

4983
05:59:51,799 --> 05:59:52,520
The fist pump.

4984
05:59:54,240 --> 05:59:55,599
Oh shit, that's wrong.

4985
05:59:55,599 --> 05:59:56,799
Wrong wife.

4986
05:59:56,799 --> 05:59:58,220
But I think you'll still like it.

4987
05:59:58,779 --> 06:00:06,729
Isn't this your daughter?

4988
06:00:06,729 --> 06:00:07,049
What?

4989
06:00:07,049 --> 06:00:07,450
No.

4990
06:00:07,450 --> 06:00:08,330
What are you talking about?

4991
06:00:08,330 --> 06:00:08,490
What?

4992
06:00:14,080 --> 06:00:14,560
No, it's not.

4993
06:00:15,200 --> 06:00:24,889
All right.

4994
06:00:24,889 --> 06:00:25,369
Sure.

4995
06:00:25,369 --> 06:00:26,250
How's the baby?

4996
06:00:26,810 --> 06:00:34,680
Okay.

4997
06:00:34,680 --> 06:00:35,240
Everything's fine.

4998
06:00:40,360 --> 06:00:41,080
Everything's fine.

4999
06:00:41,080 --> 06:00:41,479
We're good.

5000
06:00:54,729 --> 06:00:56,669
What do you want?

5001
06:00:58,409 --> 06:00:58,650
Okay.

5002
06:00:58,650 --> 06:00:58,970
We're good.

5003
06:01:01,290 --> 06:01:02,090
Let me check on the baby.

5004
06:01:02,090 --> 06:01:03,290
How's the baby doing?

5005
06:01:03,290 --> 06:01:13,689
Hello.

5006
06:01:13,689 --> 06:01:14,250
It's me.

5007
06:01:14,250 --> 06:01:16,520
Hello, Amy.

5008
06:01:16,520 --> 06:01:16,919
Okay.

5009
06:01:16,919 --> 06:01:17,720
You like the loot.

5010
06:01:17,720 --> 06:01:19,319
Let's play some loot for you.

5011
06:01:19,319 --> 06:01:31,630
Oh, plus 22.

5012
06:01:31,630 --> 06:01:33,439
I really like that.

5013
06:01:33,439 --> 06:01:34,000
Let's do it again.

5014
06:01:34,639 --> 06:01:44,639
Okay.

5015
06:01:44,639 --> 06:01:45,200
See?

5016
06:01:45,200 --> 06:01:47,500
I have a good reputation with the baby.

5017
06:01:47,500 --> 06:01:48,540
With the wife.

5018
06:01:48,540 --> 06:01:51,040
I'm going to sleep for six hours.

5019
06:01:51,040 --> 06:01:51,680
Get some health.

5020
06:01:52,240 --> 06:01:59,529
Feel much better.

5021
06:02:11,740 --> 06:02:12,060
Okay.

5022
06:02:13,099 --> 06:02:14,380
Yeah, I can check on my business.

5023
06:02:14,380 --> 06:02:22,200
How's the business doing?

5024
06:02:22,200 --> 06:02:25,659
I have made $29.

5025
06:02:25,659 --> 06:02:30,799
That's awful.

5026
06:02:30,799 --> 06:02:35,959
Check the sculpture.

5027
06:02:36,520 --> 06:02:49,849
Where's the sculpture?

5028
06:02:49,849 --> 06:02:50,650
Oh, wait a minute.

5029
06:02:50,650 --> 06:02:51,930
This is Alchemist.

5030
06:02:51,930 --> 06:02:52,970
What would you like?

5031
06:02:52,970 --> 06:02:57,610
My turn.

5032
06:02:57,610 --> 06:03:01,259
For anything in particular.

5033
06:03:01,259 --> 06:03:01,580
All right.

5034
06:03:01,580 --> 06:03:01,819
Stay there.

5035
06:03:01,819 --> 06:03:02,779
I need some health potions.

5036
06:03:03,900 --> 06:03:04,939
Come back any time.

5037
06:03:04,939 --> 06:03:06,380
You're all hob strength.

5038
06:03:06,380 --> 06:03:07,340
Let's just buy a bunch of these.

5039
06:03:07,340 --> 06:03:08,299
There you go.

5040
06:03:08,299 --> 06:03:09,659
Skill potions.

5041
06:03:09,659 --> 06:03:10,619
Will potions.

5042
06:03:10,619 --> 06:03:11,259
Yeah, I'm going to drink.

5043
06:03:11,259 --> 06:03:12,540
I'm going to just cheat.

5044
06:03:12,540 --> 06:03:18,009
One of my nephews will.

5045
06:03:18,009 --> 06:03:21,799
Okay.

5046
06:03:21,799 --> 06:03:22,360
Potions.

5047
06:03:23,240 --> 06:03:24,840
I want a will potion.

5048
06:03:26,990 --> 06:03:27,470
Excellent.

5049
06:03:30,040 --> 06:03:31,319
Drink all the potions.

5050
06:03:31,319 --> 06:03:32,119
Steal the money back.

5051
06:03:32,119 --> 06:03:32,520
I can't.

5052
06:03:33,159 --> 06:03:35,209
Skill potion.

5053
06:03:35,209 --> 06:03:36,810
Your wife looks ever happy.

5054
06:03:36,810 --> 06:03:37,680
Nice.

5055
06:03:43,119 --> 06:03:43,439
Strength.

5056
06:03:43,439 --> 06:03:45,520
I have three strength potions.

5057
06:03:45,520 --> 06:03:45,840
Whatever.

5058
06:03:45,840 --> 06:03:46,799
You know the word I'm trying to say.

5059
06:03:48,159 --> 06:03:53,240
Oh, my God.

5060
06:03:54,919 --> 06:03:57,279
Well, I'll be able to upgrade a ton of stuff in strength.

5061
06:04:03,180 --> 06:04:04,439
What time is it?

5062
06:04:04,439 --> 06:04:05,159
It's been six hours.

5063
06:04:06,750 --> 06:04:07,549
We'll probably stop soon.

5064
06:04:11,389 --> 06:04:13,229
I'm probably not going to beat the game tomorrow,

5065
06:04:13,229 --> 06:04:14,189
but you know, we'll see.

5066
06:04:20,700 --> 06:04:23,369
I didn't take a piss one time.

5067
06:04:23,369 --> 06:04:23,770
No, you're right.

5068
06:04:23,770 --> 06:04:27,770
I didn't.

5069
06:04:27,770 --> 06:04:29,130
You most certainly will not.

5070
06:04:29,130 --> 06:04:30,810
No, I probably will not.

5071
06:04:31,529 --> 06:04:33,369
But we'll still play at a bunch.

5072
06:04:34,090 --> 06:04:37,279
Okay.

5073
06:04:37,279 --> 06:04:38,479
Let me, I can level up.

5074
06:04:38,479 --> 06:04:43,840
Okay.

5075
06:04:43,840 --> 06:04:46,990
I've got four, like 5,000.

5076
06:04:46,990 --> 06:04:49,709
How much is blades?

5077
06:04:49,709 --> 06:04:51,200
Three.

5078
06:04:51,200 --> 06:04:51,439
All right.

5079
06:04:51,439 --> 06:04:52,720
I'm saving up for blades three.

5080
06:04:52,720 --> 06:04:56,889
It's too good.

5081
06:04:56,889 --> 06:04:59,709
But I can do, I need to level up this.

5082
06:04:59,709 --> 06:05:00,669
It's awful.

5083
06:05:00,669 --> 06:05:08,009
Flourishes.

5084
06:05:08,009 --> 06:05:09,689
Flourishes are really, really cool, actually.

5085
06:05:09,689 --> 06:05:10,409
From what I remember.

5086
06:05:13,419 --> 06:05:14,139
Save the game.

5087
06:05:16,619 --> 06:05:17,740
Oh, my God.

5088
06:05:18,380 --> 06:05:24,250
Have I not done that the whole game?

5089
06:05:25,639 --> 06:05:26,599
Sell chaos back.

5090
06:05:26,599 --> 06:05:26,759
Yeah.

5091
06:05:27,479 --> 06:05:35,790
Can I do that?

5092
06:05:38,360 --> 06:05:39,560
I don't think I can sell this back.

5093
06:05:46,380 --> 06:05:47,659
I'm just going to scare this guy.

5094
06:05:50,880 --> 06:05:51,599
I just feel like it.

5095
06:06:06,669 --> 06:06:07,310
Reach over.

5096
06:06:08,110 --> 06:06:09,630
Pull money out of the register.

5097
06:06:09,630 --> 06:06:11,159
Oh, press Y.

5098
06:06:17,340 --> 06:06:17,740
Wait, what?

5099
06:06:17,740 --> 06:06:19,740
I hear like the, why do I hear those bells?

5100
06:06:19,740 --> 06:06:19,979
All right.

5101
06:06:19,979 --> 06:06:21,500
Let's do some blacksmithing.

5102
06:06:21,500 --> 06:06:22,459
Everyone's going to be pissed.

5103
06:06:22,459 --> 06:06:22,939
I know.

5104
06:06:22,939 --> 06:06:24,380
Whatever.

5105
06:06:24,380 --> 06:06:25,500
Everybody hates this shit.

5106
06:06:25,500 --> 06:06:26,459
Nobody wants to watch this.

5107
06:06:26,459 --> 06:06:26,700
I know.

5108
06:06:26,700 --> 06:06:27,180
But whatever.

5109
06:06:27,659 --> 06:06:39,759
I don't think I didn't remember.

5110
06:06:44,509 --> 06:06:45,450
Oh, yeah.

5111
06:06:45,450 --> 06:06:46,490
We'll play this again tomorrow.

5112
06:06:46,490 --> 06:06:50,650
I'm not going to start at like four o'clock like today.

5113
06:06:50,650 --> 06:06:52,459
It was just a bunch of stuff I had to do today.

5114
06:06:53,659 --> 06:06:56,590
Before we start around two o'clock Pacific.

5115
06:06:57,630 --> 06:06:59,389
Yeah, that sounds good to me.

5116
06:06:59,389 --> 06:07:07,790
This is a lot of fun, though.

5117
06:07:07,790 --> 06:07:11,310
It's fun just, I mean, I don't feel like I haven't really done very much,

5118
06:07:11,310 --> 06:07:13,150
but I've enjoyed the whole time I've been playing.

5119
06:07:20,750 --> 06:07:22,270
We'll do more missions tomorrow.

5120
06:07:26,029 --> 06:07:27,630
We'll do some more story stuff tomorrow.

5121
06:07:27,630 --> 06:07:29,470
I spent the whole time just fucking around.

5122
06:07:29,470 --> 06:07:34,970
It was very fun.

5123
06:07:35,529 --> 06:07:38,080
I'm a good boy, too.

5124
06:07:47,979 --> 06:07:49,099
Yeah, I only got one hero.

5125
06:07:49,099 --> 06:07:50,060
I need two more heroes.

5126
06:07:51,259 --> 06:07:54,779
And look, if I don't beat it tomorrow, you know, it's all good.

5127
06:07:55,900 --> 06:07:57,259
I don't need to beat Fable, too.

5128
06:07:58,990 --> 06:08:04,119
We'll play it for like another six, seven hours tomorrow and see where we are.

5129
06:08:15,389 --> 06:08:18,110
Yeah, you know, everyone knows it's coming.

5130
06:08:18,110 --> 06:08:19,389
End of the stream voice is right.

5131
06:08:21,869 --> 06:08:23,389
Yeah, Hassan raided the stream.

5132
06:08:24,270 --> 06:08:28,029
If any of you are still here, thanks for checking out the stream.

5133
06:08:34,680 --> 06:08:38,060
And again, I will reiterate this next Sunday.

5134
06:08:39,340 --> 06:08:40,860
Is it going to be something very interesting?

5135
06:08:41,880 --> 06:08:43,080
I don't know exactly what it is,

5136
06:08:43,080 --> 06:08:46,040
but I've been told it's going to be a nice, really, really great time.

5137
06:08:46,919 --> 06:08:48,040
I don't really know what that means.

5138
06:08:54,319 --> 06:09:04,889
He's going to play Among Us next Sunday.

5139
06:09:04,889 --> 06:09:05,610
Oh, God, no.

5140
06:09:09,849 --> 06:09:12,250
He said he's going to raid the guy who never streams and it was you.

5141
06:09:12,889 --> 06:09:17,759
I mean, I stream once.

5142
06:09:17,759 --> 06:09:19,279
I stream like once or twice a week.

5143
06:09:24,060 --> 06:09:25,900
Raid the guy who never streams.

5144
06:09:32,029 --> 06:09:38,009
Now, I told you the only way I would play Among Us

5145
06:09:40,909 --> 06:09:44,029
is if I did an Impostor is Sus guy plays Among Us

5146
06:09:44,669 --> 06:09:47,709
and tried to get like a hundred thousand community subs

5147
06:09:49,880 --> 06:09:53,560
and just do like a massive sellout like I'm the Impostor is Sus guy.

5148
06:09:53,560 --> 06:09:54,919
Like, look at how cool this is.

5149
06:09:54,919 --> 06:09:55,959
I'm playing Among Us.

5150
06:09:55,959 --> 06:09:58,639
But the reason why I never decided to do it

5151
06:09:59,500 --> 06:10:02,560
was because that means that all those people stay

5152
06:10:02,560 --> 06:10:05,040
and it will never go away.

5153
06:10:05,040 --> 06:10:06,080
You know how many people,

5154
06:10:06,080 --> 06:10:08,479
if I were to do an Impostor is Sus guy stream,

5155
06:10:09,630 --> 06:10:11,470
they would show up and they would be like,

5156
06:10:11,470 --> 06:10:13,470
Impostor is Sus guy that they would never leave.

5157
06:10:14,029 --> 06:10:16,349
And it's the only thing I would be asked to do for the rest of my life.

5158
06:10:25,919 --> 06:10:26,959
What about the numbers?

5159
06:10:27,959 --> 06:10:30,520
Yeah, some things just aren't worth that much money.

5160
06:10:30,520 --> 06:10:31,080
You know what I mean?

5161
06:10:31,080 --> 06:10:33,159
Some things are really just not worth it to me.

5162
06:10:34,189 --> 06:10:34,909
That's one of them.

5163
06:10:36,729 --> 06:10:37,689
I don't really care.

5164
06:10:38,169 --> 06:10:41,369
I don't want like a fucking hundred thousand

5165
06:10:41,369 --> 06:10:43,209
Impostor is Sus community subs.

5166
06:10:56,409 --> 06:10:57,450
It would be wicked cool.

5167
06:10:59,119 --> 06:11:01,599
This is a thousand bucks for every single one of these I'm doing.

5168
06:11:02,159 --> 06:11:03,200
I haven't missed once.

5169
06:11:13,599 --> 06:11:14,319
Think of the debt.

5170
06:11:14,319 --> 06:11:14,959
No, I'm not.

5171
06:11:14,959 --> 06:11:15,759
I would never do it.

5172
06:11:16,560 --> 06:11:24,349
That's integrity.

5173
06:11:26,509 --> 06:11:27,389
I don't think so.

5174
06:11:27,389 --> 06:11:29,709
I think I just don't want to have to look in my Discord

5175
06:11:29,709 --> 06:11:32,939
and see 500 messages a day saying,

5176
06:11:33,020 --> 06:11:34,860
Is he going to do another Among Us stream?

5177
06:11:34,860 --> 06:11:36,540
When's the Sus guy going to do it again?

5178
06:11:37,020 --> 06:11:38,139
Where's Sus guy?

5179
06:11:38,139 --> 06:11:38,540
Where is he?

5180
06:11:38,540 --> 06:11:39,740
That stream was so good.

5181
06:11:39,740 --> 06:11:40,299
Do it again.

5182
06:11:40,299 --> 06:11:41,900
Why is he not doing it tomorrow?

5183
06:11:41,900 --> 06:11:42,540
Do it now.

5184
06:11:43,419 --> 06:11:46,040
Every stream.

5185
06:11:46,040 --> 06:11:47,240
Where's Among Us?

5186
06:11:47,240 --> 06:11:50,619
Why would the Among Us guy not play Among Us?

5187
06:11:50,619 --> 06:11:53,849
That makes no sense.

5188
06:11:53,849 --> 06:11:55,689
It would be a tear through this community.

5189
06:12:00,189 --> 06:12:05,630
Don't know.

5190
06:12:11,340 --> 06:12:12,299
It would be funny.

5191
06:12:12,299 --> 06:12:14,919
I think it would be funny for like a couple hours,

5192
06:12:14,919 --> 06:12:18,540
but I really don't want to have to bait people into being here

5193
06:12:18,540 --> 06:12:20,779
thinking that I'm going to be streaming Among Us

5194
06:12:20,779 --> 06:12:22,220
and that they stay.

5195
06:12:34,569 --> 06:12:36,490
I'm almost about to be level five blacksmith.

5196
06:12:41,209 --> 06:12:44,299
You're over exaggerating on the impact it would have.

5197
06:12:45,180 --> 06:12:45,580
I know.

5198
06:12:47,340 --> 06:12:49,020
Why do I think that's such a huge deal?

5199
06:12:49,020 --> 06:12:49,740
It just isn't.

5200
06:12:50,700 --> 06:12:53,020
That meme is so old and like dead.

5201
06:12:53,020 --> 06:12:54,380
It doesn't even matter.

5202
06:12:54,380 --> 06:13:04,810
All right, I'm going to be level five for tomorrow.

5203
06:13:08,279 --> 06:13:13,549
There it is.

5204
06:13:14,270 --> 06:13:15,069
Level five.

5205
06:13:15,069 --> 06:13:16,669
All right, I might as well just go until I can't.

5206
06:13:17,310 --> 06:13:20,299
It's not dead.

5207
06:13:20,299 --> 06:13:21,340
It's on its way out though.

5208
06:13:28,060 --> 06:13:29,099
Is Among Us still relevant?

5209
06:13:29,099 --> 06:13:29,340
I don't know.

5210
06:13:29,340 --> 06:13:29,979
I really don't know.

5211
06:13:31,709 --> 06:13:32,189
I don't know.

5212
06:13:34,520 --> 06:13:36,840
Okay, I thought I was married to the town crier for a second.

5213
06:13:36,840 --> 06:13:37,799
I was like, how did that happen?

5214
06:13:45,959 --> 06:13:48,680
All right, let's see how much money I can get doing it at level five.

5215
06:13:50,040 --> 06:13:50,599
I fucked it up.

5216
06:13:55,880 --> 06:13:57,400
Yeah, I'm going to I'm calling it here anyways.

5217
06:13:57,400 --> 06:13:57,880
We're calling it.

5218
06:13:59,470 --> 06:14:01,389
We'll pick up tomorrow with like 20,000 gold

5219
06:14:02,029 --> 06:14:03,790
and we'll do the next mission.

5220
06:14:10,060 --> 06:14:11,340
Change the title of the town crier.

5221
06:14:13,229 --> 06:14:14,990
People don't like salad dodger.

5222
06:14:15,229 --> 06:14:22,750
Nice bit of forging.

5223
06:14:22,750 --> 06:14:24,189
Oh, I also want to talk about this too.

5224
06:14:24,189 --> 06:14:26,750
This is very brief, but this is things to be excited about.

5225
06:14:28,590 --> 06:14:33,080
I am pleased to announce today that the third quarter of this year

5226
06:14:33,639 --> 06:14:35,720
is going to be fucking insane.

5227
06:14:36,459 --> 06:14:38,139
There are two streams.

5228
06:14:38,139 --> 06:14:40,299
I'm not going to go into detail of what they are at the moment

5229
06:14:40,299 --> 06:14:41,259
because I don't really need to.

5230
06:14:41,259 --> 06:14:42,220
I don't want to.

5231
06:14:42,220 --> 06:14:43,659
In August and September,

5232
06:14:43,659 --> 06:14:46,240
both of them are going to be bigger than the carnival.

5233
06:14:46,240 --> 06:14:47,400
Both of them.

5234
06:14:47,400 --> 06:14:50,119
So in August and then right after that in September,

5235
06:14:50,119 --> 06:14:51,159
there's going to be two streams.

5236
06:14:52,779 --> 06:15:01,470
And they're both larger than larger in scale than the carnival.

5237
06:15:01,470 --> 06:15:02,270
And you know what?

5238
06:15:02,270 --> 06:15:02,590
Fuck it.

5239
06:15:02,590 --> 06:15:04,029
I'll just say one of them is baseball.

5240
06:15:04,029 --> 06:15:07,400
Yeah, we are so close.

5241
06:15:07,400 --> 06:15:14,639
We are so close to completely locking that stream down.

5242
06:15:14,639 --> 06:15:16,400
And I'm so happy that we are.

5243
06:15:16,400 --> 06:15:17,439
I can't fucking wait.

5244
06:15:18,880 --> 06:15:23,040
I don't have any hard dates yet, but like we are so close.

5245
06:15:23,040 --> 06:15:30,040
But there's that's going to happen somewhere in like quarters three.

5246
06:15:30,040 --> 06:15:34,880
There's another stream that's going to be bigger than that.

5247
06:15:34,880 --> 06:15:38,240
That's happening somewhere probably in quarter three as well.

5248
06:15:38,240 --> 06:15:46,810
I can't wait.

5249
06:15:46,810 --> 06:15:50,139
You will get dates for these streams within the next,

5250
06:15:50,860 --> 06:15:52,060
I would say the next two weeks.

5251
06:15:52,779 --> 06:15:55,419
I will have probably hard dates for both of these streams.

5252
06:16:01,529 --> 06:16:04,009
There's also the grotto beast cards.

5253
06:16:04,009 --> 06:16:07,479
Oh, is it coming too?

5254
06:16:07,479 --> 06:16:08,919
Hopefully soon as well.

5255
06:16:08,919 --> 06:16:15,479
It's going to be fully loaded.

5256
06:16:15,479 --> 06:16:18,729
I told you back in because of COVID,

5257
06:16:18,729 --> 06:16:23,479
like three streams had to get completely just dumped.

5258
06:16:23,479 --> 06:16:24,279
Oh, that's it.

5259
06:16:24,279 --> 06:16:26,650
Now let me get 20,000.

5260
06:16:26,650 --> 06:16:33,900
And now we're really kind of turning the book in the chapter on that.

5261
06:16:35,040 --> 06:16:36,319
A lot more opportunities came up

5262
06:16:36,319 --> 06:16:39,369
and a lot of these streams were pretty much done.

5263
06:16:39,369 --> 06:16:42,090
The baseball stream was ready to go.

5264
06:16:42,090 --> 06:16:46,139
We were two weeks away from it happening before it was just too risky.

5265
06:16:46,139 --> 06:16:49,340
It was like we there was a bunch of the spikes in a lot of the places

5266
06:16:49,340 --> 06:16:52,409
and it was just we can't we just can't fucking do it.

5267
06:16:52,409 --> 06:16:53,049
I don't want to do it.

5268
06:16:54,119 --> 06:16:54,840
So we lost.

5269
06:16:57,819 --> 06:16:59,979
I spent money on that stream and it just never happened.

5270
06:17:01,979 --> 06:17:03,419
But I can't fuck around.

5271
06:17:04,619 --> 06:17:07,900
But now that's coming back and I can't wait.

5272
06:17:07,900 --> 06:17:13,020
So there's a couple of streams that were pushed forward

5273
06:17:13,020 --> 06:17:16,000
and you'll see them at some point in August and September.

5274
06:17:16,000 --> 06:17:28,779
All right, 20,000 and I'm out of here.

5275
06:17:28,779 --> 06:17:32,409
Oh, see you next weekend.

5276
06:17:32,409 --> 06:17:33,770
See you next Sunday.

5277
06:17:33,770 --> 06:17:41,759
I'll be live tomorrow, but still see you next Sunday.

5278
06:17:41,759 --> 06:17:43,040
You promised to watch Megamind.

5279
06:17:43,040 --> 06:17:44,560
Well, I didn't promise to watch Megamind.

5280
06:17:44,560 --> 06:17:45,599
I said I would consider it.

5281
06:17:48,959 --> 06:17:50,080
All right, only a few more.

5282
06:17:50,080 --> 06:17:51,400
Is that Otto?

5283
06:17:51,400 --> 06:17:54,889
Did Otto just bark at the door?

5284
06:17:57,180 --> 06:17:58,139
Hold on.

5285
06:17:58,139 --> 06:18:01,709
Otto, is that you?

5286
06:18:02,669 --> 06:18:06,860
All right, that's it.

5287
06:18:09,450 --> 06:18:11,130
I will see you guys tomorrow.

5288
06:18:11,130 --> 06:18:12,009
We'll call it here.

5289
06:18:13,659 --> 06:18:15,099
You promised to watch Megamind.

5290
06:18:15,099 --> 06:18:18,540
All right, I'll watch Megamind and I'll let you know how I think.

5291
06:18:19,099 --> 06:18:23,290
All right, let me save the game.

5292
06:18:23,290 --> 06:18:24,490
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5293
06:18:24,490 --> 06:18:26,400
Let's run the credits.

5294
06:18:26,400 --> 06:18:27,439
Thanks for all the community subs.

5295
06:18:27,439 --> 06:18:30,080
There were a lot of them from that Balls.

5296
06:18:30,639 --> 06:18:32,639
The Balls guy gave a lot of money.

5297
06:18:32,639 --> 06:18:36,299
It was like 50 community subs from Balsin.

5298
06:18:36,299 --> 06:18:37,099
Thank you.

5299
06:18:37,099 --> 06:18:43,720
And as always, everybody else today.

5300
06:18:43,720 --> 06:18:47,240
Thanks to Hassan.

5301
06:18:47,240 --> 06:18:48,119
Thanks to Chibli.

5302
06:18:48,119 --> 06:18:48,840
I missed this as well.

5303
06:18:48,840 --> 06:18:49,880
This is a raid.

5304
06:18:49,880 --> 06:18:52,250
I think I was in the middle of doing something.

5305
06:18:52,889 --> 06:18:53,610
I didn't see it.

5306
06:18:53,610 --> 06:18:55,770
But Chibli, thanks for the raid.

5307
06:18:55,770 --> 06:18:57,450
There's about 500 of you came from Chibli.

5308
06:18:57,450 --> 06:18:59,959
Thank you.

5309
06:18:59,959 --> 06:19:00,599
Yeah.

5310
06:19:00,599 --> 06:19:10,680
Yeah, see you guys tomorrow.

5311
06:19:11,240 --> 06:19:15,900
Let me save and continue to go.

5312
06:19:15,900 --> 06:19:21,900
Credits are off center.

5313
06:19:21,900 --> 06:19:22,299
I know.

5314
06:19:23,180 --> 06:19:23,979
I'm just terrible.

5315
06:19:24,700 --> 06:19:26,250
Let me see if I can fix it right now.

5316
06:19:26,970 --> 06:19:29,549
Got it.

5317
06:19:29,549 --> 06:19:30,110
There you go.

5318
06:19:30,110 --> 06:19:30,990
Look at that.

5319
06:19:30,990 --> 06:19:31,389
Perfect.

5320
06:19:31,950 --> 06:19:40,479
864p, Andy.

5321
06:19:40,479 --> 06:19:40,880
That's me.

5322
06:19:40,880 --> 06:19:42,240
Ooh, did I just turn this stream off?

5323
06:19:42,240 --> 06:19:42,720
Nope.

5324
06:19:42,720 --> 06:19:52,680
Can't wait for more polygamy and blacksmithing.

5325
06:19:54,919 --> 06:19:55,880
No, not so much.

5326
06:19:55,880 --> 06:19:57,560
I'm going to do missions tomorrow.

5327
06:19:57,560 --> 06:20:00,840
I'm going to actually go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, and do story stuff tomorrow.

5328
06:20:00,840 --> 06:20:02,750
Because I want to progress the game.

5329
06:20:02,750 --> 06:20:16,700
Am I going to finish it?

5330
06:20:16,700 --> 06:20:18,540
I don't think I'm going to be able to finish it.

5331
06:20:19,849 --> 06:20:23,450
We'll get pretty close.

5332
06:20:23,450 --> 06:20:30,810
But I don't think that I'm not going to do a 10-hour stream tomorrow to finish table two.

5333
06:20:30,810 --> 06:20:31,930
We'll see how far we get.

5334
06:20:32,490 --> 06:20:37,180
Do 1080p?

5335
06:20:37,900 --> 06:20:39,500
No, you don't want to do 1080p on Twitch.

5336
06:20:42,110 --> 06:20:46,509
To have good 1080p video, you need to have a bitrate that's higher than Twitch allows.

5337
06:20:46,509 --> 06:20:51,020
That's why I was in 720 for so long.

5338
06:20:51,020 --> 06:20:55,419
720p, 6,000 bitrate is good.

5339
06:20:55,419 --> 06:21:01,790
The more resolution you go up, if you don't increase your bitrate, it just looks worse.

5340
06:21:01,790 --> 06:21:07,470
So I have not increased my bitrate because I'm at the maximum.

5341
06:21:07,470 --> 06:21:12,349
What I did is I dropped my CPU preset until I can do NVENC.

5342
06:21:12,349 --> 06:21:15,229
And then I'm going to make it so that runs essentially through that.

5343
06:21:18,919 --> 06:21:22,799
So yeah, 1080 just is probably never going to work until

5344
06:21:22,799 --> 06:21:28,000
Twitch like I guess officially allows for like 10 to 12,000 bitrates.

5345
06:21:28,319 --> 06:21:30,319
I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.

5346
06:21:30,319 --> 06:21:36,029
But 864 is where I'm going to go for now.

5347
06:21:36,029 --> 06:21:40,959
Thanks again, everybody.

5348
06:21:40,959 --> 06:21:41,439
I'll see you tomorrow.

5349
06:21:42,159 --> 06:21:42,880
Have a great night.

5350
06:21:43,439 --> 06:21:46,540
Your server costs would just go way up.

5351
06:21:46,540 --> 06:21:48,779
Yeah, I really doubt that would happen.

5352
06:21:49,419 --> 06:21:57,020
Do you have any plans for the 10th anniversary of your career?

5353
06:21:57,020 --> 06:22:00,220
You made it sound like huge plans were to be had, the big anniversary milestone.

5354
06:22:03,639 --> 06:22:07,959
I mean, not particularly, but there's like two or three streams that you're going to see

5355
06:22:07,959 --> 06:22:10,279
like after June, July.

5356
06:22:12,060 --> 06:22:17,180
That, I mean, there's just massive, massive amounts of work and time going into them.

5357
06:22:17,180 --> 06:22:21,659
So I guess you could say that these couple of streams coming up are kind of big

5358
06:22:23,099 --> 06:22:25,500
deals, at least for me, being here for 10 years.

5359
06:22:26,880 --> 06:22:30,270
I don't have anything particularly planned for like the exact day.

5360
06:22:30,909 --> 06:22:39,740
We'll probably, I'll probably just be like, oh, nice.

5361
06:22:39,740 --> 06:22:40,779
Yeah, it's been 10 years.

5362
06:22:40,779 --> 06:22:44,299
It's insane.

5363
06:22:44,299 --> 06:22:47,180
I can't believe people have stayed watching this channel for 10 years.

5364
06:22:47,180 --> 06:22:49,500
That just, it blows my mind.

5365
06:22:50,220 --> 06:22:55,069
Hey, thanks to you.

5366
06:22:55,069 --> 06:22:55,470
Thanks.

5367
06:22:55,470 --> 06:22:56,590
Hey, thanks to you.

5368
06:22:56,590 --> 06:22:57,389
Thanks, you boy.

5369
06:22:58,189 --> 06:23:00,189
And 10 community subs right at the end here.

5370
06:23:00,189 --> 06:23:01,709
Appreciate it.

5371
06:23:01,709 --> 06:23:04,830
Have a great night.

5372
06:23:04,830 --> 06:23:05,470
We'll see you tomorrow.

5373
06:23:06,509 --> 06:23:32,939
Take care of yourselves.
