1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:11,179
Well, you have to put it in the pot for two hours.

2
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,179
Yeah, but what's the temperature in it?

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,179
It sits in the pot for two hours. You have to cook it for two hours, otherwise it's not gonna work.

4
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:18,179
I get it. What temperature does it have to be set at?

5
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,179
It's a fucking pot roast. You can't screw it up. Get out. I'm doing a video.

6
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,179
What's the... I need to tell you...

7
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:24,179
Get out!

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,179
Oh, Jesus.

9
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:29,179
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here.

10
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:33,179
And today, I've got a special fucking video for you.

11
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,179
Because I got access to Cube World.

12
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,060
Okay, so this is Jerma's file. We can go ahead and fucking delete that.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:47,060
Start a new file for Grandpa's character. Let's get going there. Create. Click it, baby.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,369
Was that a guitar?

15
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,609
I don't want to play the musician.

16
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,609
There's a musician, we got ear musician, we got drunk guy, we got Gremlin from Gremlins 2.

17
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,609
It was a pretty good movie, but I don't really want to play as a Gremlin.

18
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,609
We got the drunk goblin. I don't like the drunk goblin. The lizard, I like lizard people.

19
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:08,609
Undead, I don't think I want to play. Fucking frog people.

20
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:14,489
I'm playing as a fucking frog man. I'm not even going to go any further on the characters.

21
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:21,489
So what you do in Minecraft is pretty simple. You go around and you collect resources and you fight monsters.

22
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:24,489
What the hell is that? What the fuck is this? What is going on here?

23
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:28,489
What is this, a Ninja Turtles? What the fuck are the Ninja Turtles doing in this game?

24
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,489
Look, it's Leonardo that's trying to tell him behind him.

25
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:40,060
What are you doing in this game? I don't, I have no, what am I supposed to even be doing?

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,810
Does anybody know what you're doing in this game?

27
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,500
I have not figured out, all I've done is, was that a bee? It's a fucking bee.

28
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Come on, you bee bitch.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,799
You see, the real awesome part about this game is the fact that I'm battling right now as a frog.

30
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,799
There's never been a game in existence where you could fight people as frogs.

31
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,799
It just never existed and that's why I like it.

32
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,489
And that's the five experience points right there, ladies and gentlemen.

33
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:08,490
I just figured out how to play Cube World.

34
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,330
I'm concerned about the people who made this game because they're going to get fucking sued.

35
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,330
First, this is Ninja Turtles and then look, it's the Seven Dwarfs.

36
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,330
Disney is going to have a field day with these guys.

37
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,330
I can look at the Snuffy, that's Gruffy, that's Poopy and Snoopy. See, that's the Seven Dwarfs.

38
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,629
How are they not going to get sued by this?

39
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,000
I really am concerned. Let me go get a closer look here.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,240
All right, Fluffy, you need to go back to Disney World because I said so.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,069
What? They just melted me.

42
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,569
The Seven Dwarfs didn't have those fucking powers.

43
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:52,219
Would you look who it is, everybody?

44
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:56,219
It's Donatello by himself without his boys.

45
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,219
Hey, Donnie, how are you? How are the rest of the Ninja Turtles?

46
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,219
Yeah, without them you aren't so fucking tough now, are you?

47
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,969
Got something to say?

48
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:08,099
I have my own house.

49
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,789
Donatello, I think you might have a brain injury.

50
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,250
Somebody help me, somebody please help me.

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,250
I got a bunch of animals following me.

52
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,250
I got like two animal bug birds.

53
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,250
What are you doing?

54
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,250
What are you doing? Leave him alone.

55
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,250
What did he do?

56
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:30,250
Why did they do that to him, you bullies, you savages, you beasts?

57
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,250
No, leave him alone.

58
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,250
All he wanted was some bird seed. I have it in my pocket.

59
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,250
What about this bird? This bird's like, fuck that.

60
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,250
I want nothing to do with this.

61
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,250
He has absolutely nothing to do with this.

62
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,250
Well, it looks like all your friends are dead.

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,250
He's like, fuck that, dude.

64
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,250
All right, I guess I'll help you, you know, whatever.

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,250
I can't believe I'm still dead.

66
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,550
I'm dead.

67
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,789
Oh, Jesus.

68
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:57,360
Okay, I kind of feel bad about what just happened.

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,939
How did I end up in a tree?

70
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,310
What?

71
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,189
Hello, Mr. Peacock, how are you?

72
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,189
How are you today?

73
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:08,189
Yes, I smell good, thank you.

74
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,189
I've got some trouble here.

75
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:11,189
Oh, my God.

76
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,189
Kick his ass.

77
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,189
Kick his fucking ass.

78
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,189
Look at this animation.

79
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,189
Look at this awesome animation.

80
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,189
He's skiing at him.

81
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,189
Look at this.

82
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:20,189
Oh, my goodness gracious, you are...

83
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:22,560
Oh, he died.

84
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Now I'm sad.

85
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,310
I keep killing birds in this game.

86
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,310
I feel terrible.

87
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm a bird killer.

88
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,310
But to be fair here, guys, he did do that on his own.

89
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,310
I didn't ask him to.

90
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,310
He just flipped the fuck out and started skiing at the guy.

91
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,310
And you know what?

92
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,000
That's what we shoot in the clouds.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I like this game.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,310
Some kind of encampment over here.

95
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,310
Looks like there could be some food and some supplies.

96
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,310
There is nothing special.

97
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,550
Well, there is some stuff here.

98
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,550
Is this yours?

99
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,550
Hey, Mr. Swimman, hey, come on up here.

100
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,550
I want to talk to you.

101
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,920
Do you own this camp?

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
How did you build this?

103
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,610
Come on up here.

104
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,779
You want to make some food and stuff?

105
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,779
We could be friends.

106
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:07,220
No, okay, don't want to be friends.

107
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,220
You just dug your own grave.

108
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,459
See you later.

109
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,459
Get fucking rapid fired.

110
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,139
That's how you do it, ladies and gentlemen.

111
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:16,139
You take his money.

112
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,379
And then you go back and you take his food, too.

113
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:21,689
That pineapple is mine.

114
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,689
You had your chance to be friendly.

115
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,930
Just wanted to share.

116
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,620
Mmm, this is going to taste real good, baby.

117
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,620
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
