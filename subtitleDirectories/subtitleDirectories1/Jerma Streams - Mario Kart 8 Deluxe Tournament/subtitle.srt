77
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:31,579

Uh, yeah, but he's fast like big characters are fast. He's the leader of the bunch. You know him well

You get a friend's eye. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I got it. This is fucking brilliant strategy, by the way

115
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,460
Absolutely flawless strategy. They're not gonna do this shit. We're gonna fucking roll them

116

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:07,139
The bug is actually godlike shit. No, I I want I want like I want a bunch of traction

121
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,100
Oh donkey kong weighs too much. Fuck. Hold on

122
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:17,460
Shit, I want like a full bar of traction

123
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,139
I'm worried that we have people in here that shouldn't be in here. Oh, we might we could do a we could do a check

124
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:29,450
I'm gonna say are you guys in here? Are you giving my best shot that they're all in?

125
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,309
I feel like there are people in here that are not supposed to be here. Well, it should only be 12

126
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:39,179
So if you guys are all in and they're all in that it's fine. Yeah, I'm joining right now. Are you in?

127
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:43,820
Yeah, it says i'm spectating guys. You gotta turn a bunch of shit off. Don't you?

128
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,539
Why are we doing this like a tournament by the way?

129
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:49,179
We're gonna have to remake it because people join that weren't supposed to be here

130
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:52,460
Why are we doing it like a tournament and connor just uh,

131
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,600

132
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,019

134
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:10,840
Yeah, they should deduct some points for that. You'd be crazy to you guys. Anybody else get booted from that lobby?

135
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Yeah, I had to make a new one. Oh shit. Okay

136
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,440
Wait, how do you go offline? I don't think you need to I as long as you have no friends in your friends list

137
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,740
You should be okay or no friends. You've never played a game essentially if you have friends just try to join less

138
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:42,379
Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna wait. I want to use this thing. This thing's so ugly though. Okay. I'm picking the dog again a band

139
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,809
All right. I'm with you connor. Oh shit. Okay, so

All right. I'm joining dude. Who the fuck's billy eilish. Should we just be the same car cutie?

141
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:57,509
Uh, well, it depends on if you like using a certain car

142
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,789
The beetles kind of nice with doing that. I think the beetle is really is one of the best cars, but we don't have it

143
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:06,870
Wait, no, you start with the beetle. Yeah, everybody had to make a new account. Yes of the friends thing

144
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,070
No, I think you start with the the beetle you're thinking of the other one

145
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,240
What beetle are you are you talking about? I I I don't see the car. It kind of looks like a hot dog

146
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:18,889
It's like a hercules beetle

147
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:20,629
Brown

148
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:23,750
I don't see it. Oh tilt controls. Oh, is that good?

149
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,620
Yeah, I think it's good the the beetle with the red tires and the clouds i'm going nuts

150
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,340
So you might not have clouds now. Are you sure that is that top meta?

151
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,419
No chat, I don't know ask chat if it's top meta is it good they're saying it's good. It's really good

152
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,419
I'm pretty sure it's the other deal though. There's still people here. That's enough. Who is the little guy?

153
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:48,100

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,900
Buffering is insane. I'm not seeing any of that

303
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,359
I wonder why

304
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:14,069
Skill-based map. All right. I I always i'm just gonna take it slow. I hate this map. I always lose though always

305
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,549
I do really bad in this map. We're winning by the way. We're winning. We're winning 48 points. Yep

306
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,450
Well after the first race we're winning, but I don't know about second. No, we're winning we are

307
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:29,430

00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,180
So he struck my lightning, sorry

342
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,380
We hit each other a lot

343
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,470
My stream is fucked on what this

344
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:11,829
Doesn't i'm not dropping any frames

345
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,630
Lagging hold on. What if I go like this?

346
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:29,539
Fix it. I was had out and then I got hit

347
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:36,940
And then I just what oh you this bad. I've played mario kart 8 one time ever

348
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:40,630
Like an hour or two

349
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,230
Is it a slideshow? I'm I I don't understand. This doesn't make any sense

350
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,859
Anybody else buffering right now? Like I I

351
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,299
Everyone's saying the stream is buffering. I got no drop frames though

352
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:59,420
Uh, no, my mine's feeling good. Somebody's pretty happy. Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, guys

353
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,420
We are still in the lead. It is 84 to 80

354
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,700
All right. All right. Good. Good. We got this. We had a big first race

355
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:10,380
Okay, this this map you need to make sure that you're ahead. Otherwise, you're gonna get fucked because it is a

356
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,910
Very difficult map to have abilities on. Yep

357
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,049
No shit really we're in rainbow road

358
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:24,599
So try to make sure you're not in last because if you get abilities you're gonna you're gonna fall so far behind

359
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,569
I actually feel like i'm gonna pull through on this one. Okay, that's what they say about you a rainbow road, andy

360
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:46,980
So they called me

361
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,180
I'm actually fucking

00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,630

00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,630
I got something to race for dude

364
00:30:52,789 --> 00:31:04,359
I feel like that dbz character that thinks he's really fucking strong and then realizes that everybody is a thousand times stronger

365
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,440
No matter how much you try

366
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:16,700
Like I just kind of had one of you guys in the chest and you were just like, oh, let's get by a fucking mosquito

Hold on. What if I do this?

00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:24,539
Is it restart the stream?

387
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:45,240

389

00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,320

417
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:12,630
Let's go. Oh, that was huge. I do not feel like i'm running on a fucking tricycle. Why am I so slow?

418
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,780
Oh, that was huge

419

Thank you. I'm gonna change cars

421
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:34,309

422
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:36,949

423
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,429
I sniped three of them at the end

424
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,469
Like two before the last turn and somebody right at the end as well. Like I took three of them

425
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,530
Fucking look at the speed. I on discord so I can see your perspective

426
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,199
Um

427
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,239
Or present that would be very difficult. Yeah, i'm live you

428
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Let me see if I can figure it out

429
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,960
No worries. I don't know what's going on

430
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,840
But I think from trying to stream my perspective like i'm buffering my stream, but i'm not dropping any frames. It's weird

431
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,320
That's oh sometimes it does that and if it does that just back out. It's fine

432
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,500
I'm just trying to get a problem on this map mrs. Your stream's blocked so you can turn it off. Oh shit

433
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,579
Really? Yeah, I don't know why

434
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,820

436
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,739
By the way, get behind other dongs and use them so you can get some speed

437
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:36,780

00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,960
Lag went away by the way saw that ninth place. Don't think we didn't see it

506
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,440
Did anyone on our team get 12th place no

507
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,199
Nice nice. What about 11? That's 11. Yeah, we did get 11th. I will say that i'm not gonna name names

508
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,000
But one of us got 11. Okay. Yeah, we don't want to talk about it. All right

509
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,809
This track is yeah exactly it is such a short map so it just that's it this fucking it dies immediately

510
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:49,179
Okay, 16 points

511
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:53,900
Dude, I feel like this this my beetle's not that good because the boost on the beetle is really bad

512
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:58,940
Hey, feel free to switch it up. You should go with the wiggler. I might

513
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:05,820
I don't think he has the wiggler. I'm trying as hard as I can right now. This is my worst mat

514
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:15,230
You're donkey pong. You can build up speed behind me. Yeah, there you go. Wait, I got a red who's ever in second

515
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,360
I can throw the cut

516
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,900
Yeah

517
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,019
Fuck

518
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:25,340
It's so hard to coordinate who to throw things to

519
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:31,280
What the fuck's that thing?

520
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,519
Oh, yeah, you have to dodge it the the the scary boy. Who's uh, who's the first they have um, they have blue

521
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,239
Oh, he's a blue germa. I'm a whole blue ante. That's what you call me. All right, there you go

522
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:54,650
I'm gonna like click click get in front and you throw a germa. Okay, throw it throw it throw it got it

523
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,960
Oh, I got bombed

524
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,559
No, wait, I just lost I just lost I just lost I just lost I got hit off the eye

525
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,559
No, you're good. No, I'm not good

526
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:22,780
I'm terrible. Okay. I don't touch anybody. I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. We are all in last place. This is really bad

527
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,420
Yeah

528
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,420
You got triple reds in second fuck you quinn

529
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,539
I have a blue shell. I have a blue shell. Should I throw it? Oh, yeah

530
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,539
Wait, that's over. Oh, I got second. Damn it. We got rocked

531
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:44,460
I'm, I was literally on the edge. I got hit knocked off. It was over

532
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:48,760
That was a great play earlier though germa when you threw the blue

533
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,679
I I triple tapped somebody with green shells. That was my fault. I'm sorry

534
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:57,880
It worked out it worked. It just clinked out double reds behind me in second. I couldn't do anything

535
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,579
We should still be first. I think

536
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,860
Keep the morale up. All right, is it big on a favorite track?

537
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,139
Baby mark the baby one the baby. I've been

538
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,500
We could gamble with babies. Let's run. Let's run baby park. Fuck it. Which one is it in?

539
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,019
Dude

540
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:26,139
I had that man. That's what it's in at the leaf the animal crossing one

541
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:32,269
Yeah, baby park is pure rng. That is a is that is that the did they update it already?

542
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,880
I'm down for baby park or yoshi. So the baby park is it is a gamble

543
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:40,519
Yoshi, you don't want that. That's the best track

544
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,719
Really? I oh, I love that track

545
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:48,599
Yeah, i've never seen clint lose them stream looks good. No. Yeah, i'm sorry guys. I have no idea why that was happening

546
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:51,599
This is bizarre. Sorry

547
00:47:51,760 --> 00:48:00,030
Seems like it's fixed now. Let's go. Oh shit. We're we're ahead by like seven points only six points

548
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,389
Okay, if you get a mushroom go through the middle, you're probably gonna get a mushroom

549
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,900
So just be wary and go through the middle. It can literally make or break you. Okay

550
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:21,579
Hold the mushroom for the middle

551
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:22,860
What hit me?

552
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,980
Uh, I think I just popped I have shells circling me and I think I got too close

553
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:32,969
Okay

554
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:34,969
Oh

555
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:39,929
This is what mario cries like now, huh?

556
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,369
It's fun

557
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:58,329
I mean like that

558
00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:00,329
It's 10 coins for max speed, right?

559
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:13,500
Yeah. All right. Nice

560
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,980
I deserve that. Oh jesus. Oh, okay

561
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,750
I just ruined mango's life

562
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,599
Okay, i'm right behind mango now

563
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,519
nice

564
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,820
Oh alinity, i'm sorry. Oh wait, never mind

565
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,179
All right

566
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:37,179
All right. I'm in third. Oh my god

567
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,860
If anybody gets a blue call it out and matt can go behind

568
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:51,559
Got him

569
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:56,679
I got a bullet to careful

570
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,800
Clint has a red shell in first

571
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,800
They must wait good blue good blue

572
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,679
Blue's coming matt blue's coming coming guys. Fuck i'm good

573
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,880
I'm pulling from the back

574
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
Please swear god. Yeah, you should have used it

575
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:17,900
Who was in first?

576
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,940
me

577
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,820
You need to go behind clinton in the blue. I couldn't I was too far ahead

578
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,179
It looked like you were that far ahead. Oh shit. I was

579
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:28,969
I was getting first

580
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:30,969
I was doing good, too

581
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:36,969
I couldn't I literally stopped. Oh, wait, apparently that's a tough one. Clint saw it coming and clint stopped too. That's what happened

582
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:41,130
That's all right. We got second third and fourth. That's good. Oh, that's good. We got yeah, we got second

583
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,329
Overall, yeah

584
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:50,679
Oh, yeah, that was overall. So someone must have told clint that that was coming and clint stopped as well

585
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,219
So

586
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,539
What should I get for a car for something that has no idea what's going on?

587
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,260
What should I do? I'm trying to drift i'm trying to learn

588
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:01,630
What do I do?

589
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,070
drifting too much

590
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,440
What car should I have?

591
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,829
drift more often

592
00:51:08,829 --> 00:51:12,349
I don't even remember. No, we definitely didn't win that round. We definitely lost points. I don't want to talk about it

593
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:16,269
I think we lost alan we need to just go through our g here. Yeah, we're probably tied

594
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:21,659
We're probably tied. Yeah, we were up seven. So I think it's going to be very close

595
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:25,929
Do you guys want to comment on why you are so adamant on going to baby park?

596
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:33,210
Rng, baby, what do you like? Okay, you want the gamble? Yeah, actually i'm now suede i'm on your side

597
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:38,329
It's all it's okay. It's track twice. It's been clint's track twice in a row

598
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:43,050
That is you want to talk about this you want to talk about a little weird a little weird. Um, okay

599
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,050
It's updated. We are oh

600
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:52,400
We're losing by two points guys. Okay. Okay. I can't come in last place. I'm trying i'm trying not to have that happen

601
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,400
No, no, you got

602
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
On the side early because then you get full coins

603
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,659
Oh, do you?

604
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:01,019
Yes

605
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:06,400

606
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,760
Yeah, me neither. I forgot where it was. Okay. I'm with you preso in third

00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,800

613
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:08,480

614
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,760
Let me get oh

615
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,039
Wow

616

Guys guys guys, uh

617
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:18,480
Connecting time so this is a four fun race

618
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,119
Wait, what happened?

619
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:28,079
Wubbies thing disconnected, uh, he's in the in the lobby still he just for some reason it loaded longer than everyone else

620
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:35,760
So this is purely for fun race it won't count and if it happens again, we'll just remove like bottom two scores for exhibition

621
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,719
Dude, I I hate people that just make us like lap the weight all the time. It just drives me nuts

622
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,360
Like I don't know

623
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I actually just get him out of here

624
00:53:55,449 --> 00:53:57,449
Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right

625
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,449

Taking out connor holding me back because you guys man taking out connor part two

627
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,119
He wasn't expecting that one. It worked second time

628
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:18,699
No, you suck hurry up, why am I so slow? Uh, go same map go same map

629
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:24,699
Remember you're trying so hard. I really am I don't want to come in last place every time

630
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:33,519
Because now the final score is fucked

631
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,119
That was weird though, because I saw paid money right next to me the whole time so yeah, was it a bot or

632
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,960
Wait, wait, why do you want us to all just click the path zero, right?

633
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,159
Oh, I didn't do that. Might be

634
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:50,880
Oh, I thought we had to hit f0. Yeah, you're right. No, you're you're right. I wasn't paying attention. Neither was preso

637
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:12,429
Yeah, the problem is that we selected 12 races so even though we want to play another we'll have to

638
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:15,389
So he said this guy sucks

639
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:18,750

What in that map if you get hit? No to me that that was that was like uh

707
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:18,519
it was like an a leslie nielsen movie where he's

708
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:24,829
He somehow got into being like a conductor at an orchestra and he's trying to find the person that's in the audience

709
01:01:24,909 --> 01:01:26,909
That's like the criminal and he's like

710
01:01:28,349 --> 01:01:30,750
He's trying to like find a place like he's trying to find the guy

711
01:01:31,469 --> 01:01:37,159
Is a boomer reference, that's a great. He's a great actor. What's our best track?

712
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:38,920

Oh, there's no way we can win this no, there's not we went for the hail mary

718
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,619
I think if you get her second third fourth fifth and sixth you might

719
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,260
That's what I said

720
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:19,630
I picked baby park again somehow

721
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:26,429
You wanted it bad I get well, maybe we're going there I should go there

722
01:02:26,989 --> 01:02:36,349
But harbor I fuck with it gotta be the best race of your life. All right

Holy shit, that was bad. I uh

01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,559
I severely severely underestimated how much better everybody at mario car was in this call

750
01:05:56,349 --> 01:06:00,190
I thought we were just I thought that like we were gonna be driving backwards. We're driving into people

751
01:06:01,769 --> 01:06:03,610
People were good

752
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,610

01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,909
More speed. All right, so I should get more speed

769
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:14,730
Well, let me unlock some of this stuff because like I we had to make new accounts

770
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:24,219
longer drifts

771
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:26,840
What should I what should I play with what character?

772
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:39,239
Goals to get first place. Yeah

773
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:52,139
The thing is I like played a little bit off stream and I was like, oh, okay. This is going well

774
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,369
No, no, not at all

775
01:07:55,449 --> 01:08:03,690
All right, I gotta join this thing

776
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:07,210
But some of us are still playing

777
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:13,800
It says you're playing

778
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:19,420
Yeah, I didn't leave. I think we're supposed to leave but no I

779
01:08:20,539 --> 01:08:21,899
I'm making a new group

780
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:26,460
Okay, okay. You connor i'm gonna go to the bathroom real fast. Did it close the entire lobby?

781
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:34,460
So who's who's a good character then what should I play as character? Oh wait, that was like advice

782
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,920
Character any level three heavy such as bar bowser wario or morton

783
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:51,949
Pipe frame card blue falcon and streetl are ideal. All right streetl. I'm gonna go with

784
01:08:52,750 --> 01:09:07,039
Morton and streetl because I don't think I have the other one unlocked. All right, you're not good enough for heavies

785
01:09:07,949 --> 01:09:12,670
Well, I mean I just i've literally come in in in ninth through 12th place every single time

786
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:22,119
It's not I don't have those unlocked

Everybody's saying I don't deserve fifth. I know I don't but isn't that how mario kart works

880
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:34,350
That is how it works using the word deserve when there's a giant blue shell that goes from 12th to first to lift light them up

881
01:20:34,989 --> 01:20:36,989
It's a little clean. What did you get that round?

887
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:10,880

01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,239

Dude, this shit will double my bank account. Just let me have this. Oh god, not this map

907
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:41,930
I was just wondering what the sand that has the succ in the middle

908
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,970
Yes

909
01:24:45,529 --> 01:24:47,529

Do you think that quicksand would give a good like blowjob? What the fuck? Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry

911
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:57,439

Oh my fucking god. Are you kidding me?

919
01:25:53,470 --> 01:26:07,039
All right, it's not over

920
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:22,649
Get out of the sand

921
01:26:22,649 --> 01:26:24,649
There's so many bullet bills

922
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:40,520
Damn it. Don't hit me. Don't hit me. Please don't hit me. You're behind me. Please don't hit me. Please. Please. Please don't do it

Don't fuck it was done for oh

925
01:27:28,329 --> 01:27:35,470
Somebody said somebody's using a hacked switch going for 11th place

926
01:27:36,029 --> 01:27:38,510
I guess i'm going for it now one and i'm

927
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:45,949
Hit by everything starting with the simply dodging grabbing my double double items hitting me with it

928
01:27:46,909 --> 01:27:49,869
Yeah, did those fireballs hit you by chance? I threw a couple back

929
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:54,409
Shut up fireballs hit me when I was in fourth at the end and I finished 11th

930
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:57,210
I'm desperately just trying to

931
01:27:57,369 --> 01:27:59,550
Not be in the last place

932
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:01,550
Dude, it's this bike. I'm not playing with it anymore

933
01:28:03,149 --> 01:28:05,149
Oh my god, that was dreadful

934
01:28:06,829 --> 01:28:08,829
It's definitely bike for sure

935
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,180
You sound like a flustered grandma

936
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,920
I could I probably couldn't be your grandma right now. I mean, i'm probably like old enough to be your grandma

937
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:21,039
And i'm kind of flustered so it makes a little sense

938
01:28:22,569 --> 01:28:24,569
Just get away from me

939
01:28:25,369 --> 01:28:27,369
I don't like to go near you at all. It's you

940
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:39,420
Wait, what place did you get second? Let's go. Let's do it. All right

941
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,689
All right concentration

Let me try to get first. I can't believe I had first the first game

943
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:03,520
What happened? What the fuck was that?

944
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:16,539
Oh shit, that could have been me

945
01:29:16,539 --> 01:29:28,399
That could have been me

946
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:30,159
Oh shit

947
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,399

01:31:26,909 --> 01:31:31,069
Yeah, there was non-stop bumper cars at the end. That was pure luck. Whoever got top five

959
01:31:31,789 --> 01:31:33,310
Yeah

960
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:37,710
I will say clint had no competition for first on that one. No, he didn't he did not. I mean

961
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:40,590
charlie was close and then

962
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,829
I hit him like three times

963
01:31:43,069 --> 01:31:45,069
And we're having fun. Stop stressing

964
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:47,630
I'm just fucking around. Don't worry

01:31:57,079 --> 01:31:58,439

Wait, who's in first who's in first right now alivia is in first place with

01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,600
I mean you guys do understand that the last game

970
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,760
What if we play i'm gonna i'm gonna drive the wrong way and just try to drive into the person in first place

971
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:11,850
And you understand that right?

972
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:14,010
Become inaccurate if someone drops or something

973
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:19,130
Oh, no

974
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:21,689
That's such vm like I don't think I could get away with it

975
01:32:22,409 --> 01:32:24,409
In the race for the money who are

976
01:32:24,569 --> 01:32:26,569
In eleven

977
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:36,489
Sixth place is prezzo and he's tied with connor or no one behind connor who's the seventh?

978
01:32:37,289 --> 01:32:39,289
Uh charlie

01:32:45,369 --> 01:32:47,770
Yeah, that's 12th place lead uh hit me pretty hard

980
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:53,880
I need coins

981
01:33:13,819 --> 01:33:19,850
Bananas everywhere jesus, there is a lot of bananas. I know they're everywhere. It's insane

982
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:30,729
Dude, baby park is the one map where I like lean with every turn like my body

983
01:33:31,289 --> 01:33:33,289
Holding the controller can't stay still

984
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:46,359
Oh, don't touch me and there I go there goes my lead what the fuck

985
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,220
There goes everything I worked for in life. It's over

986
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:55,260
Oh my god, that was a perfect time

987
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:08,909
That was perfect timing to use the star

988
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:17,149
I I played that so well and I still got ninth like I I clutched every turn and then one red hits me

989
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:23,239
We just got a new spot coming in. There's a secret gift for random placing between fifth and twelfth

990
01:34:24,039 --> 01:34:30,039
Oh, what? Oh, that's big random number generator five through twelve and then one of them you're scared

991
01:34:31,159 --> 01:34:36,039
Uh, no, no, I wouldn't do that clint. Can you do a placey one? What's the shittiest one grumble volcano, right?

992
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:43,949
Last one in what way the grumble volcano is like the worst course grumble. I like it actually. Oh, all right

993
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:48,829
Cool clan pick boom metals are scared thousands castles. I think people are pretty bad

994
01:34:49,390 --> 01:35:04,859
Toad's turnpike. Oh shit. Is it actually gonna do it? No, let jex play

995
01:35:06,649 --> 01:35:13,689
I've definitely improved. Okay, like the first like four or five races, especially I literally had blindfold on

996
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:24,489
All right, I got I got at least place in the top six. Let's go. Hold on eyes eyes my eyes

997
01:35:30,489 --> 01:35:32,489
That's what you get. You gotta knock somebody out right at the beginning

998
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:54,090
This one hurts my head. Oh

999
01:35:55,069 --> 01:35:57,630
It's fine. Relax like five people just did that

1000
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:18,060
Oh fuck that. No

1001
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:19,640
Whoa

1002
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,840
Whoa

1003
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:40,880
I'm fine. What did me? Uh, oh watch this shit

1004
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,840
How do I how do I cycle between items? How do you cycle between items?

1005
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:48,239
I'm gonna hold this to the very end

1006
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:52,699
How do you cycle between items? You can't

1007
01:36:53,579 --> 01:36:56,539
What what's fucking happen? What is that? It's gonna same two items again

1008
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:18,939
Just use it. Whatever

1009
01:37:18,939 --> 01:37:22,619
Seventh fucking place whatever height squeeze

1010
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:32,250
Brutal just keep getting last place man. It's really unfortunate. Why did you sit there?

1011
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:36,430
Simply he's coming for a long time. I saw him my controller

1012
01:37:39,149 --> 01:37:47,229
I'm just gonna start waiting non-stop. How many more races do we have? I believe that was

1013
01:37:49,069 --> 01:37:53,229
Five more. All right. All right. Oh, wow. Holy fuck. There's still plenty of time to uh to pull this back

1014
01:37:54,189 --> 01:37:58,829
Oh plenty of time. That's what I was thinking. I'm gonna get first place every time now. I'm actually gonna start playing

1015
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,579
Whoever used lightning in the last game is a fucking hero

1016
01:38:06,539 --> 01:38:09,739
Thank you clint. Didn't you have a a star during that too?

1017
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:16,800
I did that I had a star during that. Oh, are you trying to imply that I don't deserve to get second because I get a star

1018
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:23,680
Yes, I I think third is more up your alley, you know, I will see on this one

1019
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:36,670
What does it do the imposter is sus face? No, just go google it. That's okay. I'm still in eighth place

1020
01:38:36,909 --> 01:38:39,279
So I think both of us are great

1021
01:38:40,189 --> 01:38:42,189
Really? Yeah, I don't know why everything's so cocky

1022
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:52,279
Oh, that's a trap jam

1023
01:38:52,279 --> 01:38:54,279
Turn into a mud bath immediately

1024
01:38:55,789 --> 01:38:58,270
Oh fuck. Oh, that was a scary thing

1025
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:03,739
Okay, goodness. This place is ridiculous

1026
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:06,000
Okay

1027
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,270
Okay

1028
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:14,989
Oh, I hit his hand. I just jumped over that. Oh, I can't believe I jumped over

1029
01:39:17,689 --> 01:39:19,689
This map is wacky

1030
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,000
shit

1031
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,390
All right back in it

1032
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:43,390
How am I so far away?

1033
01:39:43,470 --> 01:39:48,539
It's absurd

1034
01:39:48,539 --> 01:39:50,859
Karma, no, no, no turn

1035
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,319
I I lost I lost

1036
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:58,479
How'd you get a first this one?

1037
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:01,739
Okay, fuck karma

1038
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,899
Clint, where are you?

1039
01:40:03,899 --> 01:40:07,840
He's first. He's in first, but he's me

1040
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,100
If you just keep asking him questions, he'll get rattled

1041
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:18,329
Me and manga are going after him

1042
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Come on no get away from me

1043
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:47,640
Slow down. Oh, oh you juked me. Oh my god. Are you fucking kidding me? How did you dodge that bomb?

1044
01:41:04,109 --> 01:41:06,109

1045
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:09,710
You robbed me, man

1046
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:14,590
Did clint drive off the level? What happened there? Yeah, I drove off the level

1047
01:41:16,189 --> 01:41:22,989
Unnecessary place of all time and then drove off the level charlie. That was so unnecessary. You rammed me

1048
01:41:24,109 --> 01:41:26,109
Wait, how did I get second?

1049
01:41:26,189 --> 01:41:28,829
Is this my first time playing mario kart? No, but come on

1050
01:41:30,989 --> 01:41:32,989

He has no nose right now. I did almost rage quit accidentally that would have been bad

1058
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,560

I I my eyes were red. I I just full of rage. I'm, sorry

1060
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:18,960
I do one impression and this happens that was so unneeded rage quit at the ninth race

1061
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:22,880
I think it was actually me that hit you miss. It's race where I drove. No, it's charlie

1062
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:28,079
I literally saw charlie rammed me at the star and I hit you with fireballs on my screen

1063
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:35,199
No, he he I did not deserve that at all. He's he saw me. Yeah, you're a good man. Don't take it personally

1064
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:39,359
That wasn't the real charlie. I would never do that. Okay. Oh wait, this is my map

All right

1179
01:56:46,329 --> 01:56:47,850

1205
01:58:14,199 --> 01:58:17,960
Next week, let's say ban clint put him in the hall of fame. He's too goaded

1206
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:23,079
Uh, you're dead to me. Have you ever thrown another shell in this town again?

1207
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:27,880
I already am going to fucking confessional about it. I feel bad

So is it like everyone against everyone and this is a real thing

1215
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:07,960
I don't even know what competitive battleship is. That's unbelievable clint clint's not invited to this right because he won

1216
01:59:08,729 --> 01:59:11,390
Uh, why would I be excluded from the battleship?

1217
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:13,390

1234
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:14,189
The stream was so fucked up. I think it was good because I we were pulling perspectives into lidwig stream

1235
02:00:14,350 --> 02:00:15,550
so

1236
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:16,979

Man, i'm in my own little world where me coming in first place at like 50 cc is like really good

1242
02:00:38,979 --> 02:00:44,340
When I saw 150 cc, I was like, oh

02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:48,449
That sounds fun

1244
02:00:48,829 --> 02:00:53,119
I like play on 50 or 100

1245
02:00:53,119 --> 02:01:00,850

But it's all right, uh, and that's gonna be it. I'm gonna i'm gonna close it out here
