1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:20,570
Play FNAF. Okay, which one? Which one? Okay, what do I have? I have... I have Five Nights at Freddy's

2
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:27,500
and Five Nights at Freddy's 2. Five Nights at Freddy's 1? Oh my god, you're trying to get me

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:35,740
fucking... Five Nights at Freddy's 1? Alright, let's make a prediction here. I don't think I'm

4
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:48,409
gonna get past the first night or the second night. 2? 2 is better. I'll do 1. I'll do 1. Alright,

5
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:56,600
let's go. I bet you I don't even make it past the first night. You know how I play Five Nights at

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,909
Freddy's? I close both doors, have both lights on, and I go like this. Cover my eyes, cover my

7
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:19,609
ears like this and just wait. Alright, let's play Five Nights at Freddy's 1. Whatever.

8
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:36,620
This is gonna be loud, isn't it? Does it even have graphic options? No, there's no graphics

9
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:57,269
options in Five Nights at Freddy's 1. Let's see. Is it too loud? I can't even tell if it's being

10
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:16,810
captured. There we go. Alright, here we go. Five Nights at Freddy's 1. What the fuck is happening?

11
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:24,520
Okay, I told you I'm not full of shit. This is a Steam Cloud save file. I didn't get past the

12
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:36,280
first night. You thought I was full of shit? You thought I was making that up? Here we go.

13
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:51,659
Hello! Hello! Hello! Oh, look out! It's Chicky and Foxy and Freddy!

14
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,689
No, hold on. I gotta do the right way. It's this. Not like this. My brother taught me this when we

15
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:26,969
were younger. We went to go see the alien ride at Disney World. It was the thing that used to be

16
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,009
the Lilo and Stitch ride and it was terrifying. And he's like, dude, is that what you do? You go

17
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,729
like this, cover with your pinkies and your eyes and block your ears with your thumbs

18
00:03:35,449 --> 00:04:30,089
and you're gonna be fine. Did I make it? How much battery do I have? I even pressed a single

19
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:37,480
button. No, I told you. I got it. Look at it. They ain't getting in. Not on night one.

20
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:42,810
Open the doors. No!

21
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,860
Oh, I don't like having the doors open. I hate this game.

22
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:26,939
How did I not get past night one? Isn't that impossible?

23
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:46,040
It's actually impossible. Why did I not do it? You must have been zonked.

24
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,610
Why do you treat all video games like a joke? I just beat Cuphead's DLC in like an hour and

25
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:38,310
12 minutes. I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm gonna lose because I wasted all the power. They don't even

26
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:46,709
leave on the first night. They actually don't even leave on the first night. I think Freddy

27
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:57,370
leaves and goes into one other room. Click Freddy's nose in the poster. It's pretty funny.

28
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:03,959
Yeah, so then nobody moves until like three or four a.m. I think Freddy disappears.

29
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:14,339
What's that sound? What is that sound? What's that sound? What's that sound?

30
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:26,170
Did I spawn like a monster or something? I don't know what that fucking sound is.

31
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:35,769
What did I do? You made me spawn something. I never pressed Freddy's fucking nose before.

32
00:07:36,089 --> 00:09:21,019
I didn't know. Why would it just quit the game? God damn it. I'm sorry. I fucked up. Can you guys

33
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:28,059
see it? All right. I'm not going to fuck it up. I promise. All right. All right. All right. I can't

34
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:38,389
see chat either. Is it reasonably good? Why did it quit? Stop quitting. All right. Can you see?

35
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:59,610
Hold on a second. Just make a few adjustments to my Herman Miller

36
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:31,269
MBODY chair. Refund this game. Guys, I bought this game like nine years ago. I don't think

37
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:39,929
the refund. I think I'm out of the seven day window. Refund the bet. Oh, so what are you

38
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:53,059
talking about? They would understand. Can you imagine trying to refund a game that you bought

39
00:10:53,059 --> 00:11:00,230
10 years ago? I mean, I technically only have an hour and 20 minutes in it. I mean,

40
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:08,139
I didn't really like it that much. I didn't really get to it. Other games kind of took over there.

41
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:26,950
It's actually 14 days. Yeah. Don't play this game. I'm scared. All right. Have they moved yet? No.

42
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:47,450
Oh, I'm running over a thing. POG 87 power left. Yep. What the fuck is going on there? What was

43
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:53,340
that? What happened? Excuse me. What are you talking about? Excuse me. Why did that happen?

44
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:07,379
I've never seen that before. And we're fucking around. Why did I do that? I don't know. I just

45
00:12:07,379 --> 00:13:13,700
spawned something. What does that actually do? What does that actually do? Hello. Wait, hold on. Let

46
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:28,230
me see if I can get it. That was close. Give me an Oscar. No, no, no, no, no. It's wrong. I had it

47
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:45,940
wrong. It's like, oh, dude, this is why we're fucked. That fucking Foxy comes out of there.

48
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,720
I heard this. My fucking son played this one. Fucking Foxy comes out of there and

49
00:13:49,720 --> 00:14:00,059
sprints down the fucking hallway. It was fucked up. No, I never played this before. I don't know.

50
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:19,529
Don't look at Foxy. Oh shit. Somebody fucking moved. They walk down halls and stuff. They

51
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:28,200
fucking walk down the hall. I played it before. I know it. Wait. Oh shit. There it is. Okay.

52
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,539
I'll fucking drop this guy if he fucking comes in my... If he comes over to the door,

53
00:14:33,539 --> 00:16:11,080
I'm gonna fucking drop him. Ain't nobody getting in here now. That was too soon. I don't think it

54
00:16:11,080 --> 00:17:16,299
was. Oh shit. Get out of here. What happened? What? Close the door. Close the door. Close the

55
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:44,950
door. Okay. I'm good. Six aim coming. Oh no. What are you gonna do? Bulletproof glass. Bulletproof

56
00:17:44,950 --> 00:18:33,609
glass. You ain't getting in bulletproof glass. Who's over here? Oh no. Bulletproof glass. Oh,

57
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:46,900
I missed it. Fucking good. I'm fucking good. No, we're good. All right. Night two. This is where

58
00:18:46,900 --> 00:19:01,690
it gets a little crazy. This is where it gets crazy. I'm not touching anything until at least

59
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:38,890
2 a.m. Just get out of the chair and leave. I have a funny idea. What if I just pretend to fall asleep

60
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:45,210
on stream? All right. I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on stream. I'm gonna put a text on the

61
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:52,890
bottom that says like, dude, wicked fucking tired. I had a long day and then you're woken up by the

62
00:19:52,890 --> 00:20:00,309
jump scare. You guys can be like, wake up, dude. Wake the fuck up. Wait, what do I have to do?

63
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:08,200
Do I have to do a light? How do I stop that from happening? How do I stop that from happening?

64
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:35,220
How do I stop that from happening? Where is this motherfucker? Uh oh. Uh oh. Where are you? Oh.

65
00:20:35,220 --> 00:21:46,140
Oh, we'll do it on. Oh, we'll do it on night three. Open the doors up. Lights. Why? That's

66
00:21:46,140 --> 00:23:24,250
extra power. They haven't moved. When's it gonna be 3 a.m.? Dude, it's been 2 a.m. for an hour. Oh,

67
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:38,470
shit. Oh, where are you going? All right. You went that way. You're here. All right. What happened?

68
00:23:38,470 --> 00:24:54,009
I have to keep looking at Foxy, right? Uh oh. What the fuck? What happened? What happened? Is that bad?

69
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:05,910
Is that bad? Am I okay? Am I actually, am I okay? Am I, am I okay? Am I all right? Why is it

70
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:29,319
happening? Am I all right? What does that mean? I fucking quit the goddamn game. I exited the

71
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:51,019
fucking game. No, I didn't. I'm still in. Close the door. All right. I'm good. Is he still there?

72
00:25:51,019 --> 00:26:42,660
What the fuck are you still doing here, you dick? What the fuck is happening? I don't get it. I

73
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:49,029
don't get it. I actually don't get it. I, guys, I've played Five Nights at Freddy's for a shitty

74
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:57,130
YouTube video one time and I wasn't even paying attention to the game. All right. Hold on. We're

75
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:19,930
doing this though. All right. What should I say? Like really tired today. Not like long day. Just

76
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:51,539
chilling with stream. Whatever. Right. Let's do, and the cam is going to be huge too. And I got to

77
00:27:51,539 --> 00:28:02,859
look realistic. Why would you fucking play Five Nights at Freddy's? Oh yeah. I'll turn the lights

78
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:53,109
off. Okay. Hold on. Just like, is that all right? Should it be a little brighter? Hold on. Which,

79
00:28:53,109 --> 00:29:00,970
yeah. Put the death counter on too. So people think it's automatic. Right. People think it's

80
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:07,029
automatically counting the amount of times I die in Five Nights at Freddy's. I've died 600 fucking

81
00:29:07,029 --> 00:30:11,500
times. Okay. Here we go. Make it 15. That's way too many. Maybe like 30 or like 60 or something.

82
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:20,940
Right. 600 means I've been here for a long time. 62. Right. All right. That's fine. All right. Can

83
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:35,180
we get some, can I, how about this? All right. That looks good. Let's go. This is going to be

84
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:43,049
fucking stupid. Can you guys, can you guys see it? Can you guys, you guys can see it, right?

85
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:59,910
Okay. Here we go. Why would you do this?

86
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:48,299
Fuck.

87
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:22,250
Fuck.

88
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:33,210
No, I was so close. Reset, reset. We got to reset. We got to reset. We got to reset. Reset,

89
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:41,750
reset, reset, reset, reset. Fuck. You don't know how hard it is to do that. To sit here and know

90
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:48,150
that there's like 20,000 people all spamming wake up and shit. And I'm some dumb ass that's

91
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:54,309
why do I have an auto redoing Five Nights at Freddy's death counter? And why am I sleeping

92
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:58,390
to this? It's, it's too much. It's too much. My brain can't do. All right. I'm going to go. Here

93
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:14,280
we go. It's so hard. The bottom text is covered by the game. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go,

94
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,880
go. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Good. All right.

95
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:42,070
Let's go. I won't fuck it up this time. I swear to God. It's so stupid.

96
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:05,239
One more try. I swear to God. I swear. I'll get it. I'm so, it's, I'm so hard. It's so hard.

97
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:16,460
You have no idea. Again, again, I promise. I'll get it this time. I promise. I promise. I swear

98
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:41,400
to God. I'll get it right now. All right. Everybody shut up. Go and begin fucking telephone.

99
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:49,400
It's the stupid telephone that keeps it. It's, it's like the phones ringing in the house

100
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:58,679
and I'm sleeping. Someone's trying to reach me so bad. It's just like, Holy shit, dude,

101
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:03,239
you're on stream. Get up, wake up, dude. Turn your stream off. Call his fucking landline.

102
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:18,710
Dude, I wouldn't call your landline at 10 o'clock, but seriously, man. All right. Here we go. I gotta

103
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:29,179
get this. I have to. I have to get this. I will do whatever it fucking takes. It's just the fucking

104
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:45,579
phone ringing. Just sitting there. Okay. Dude, wake up. I'm calling your house. Okay. Come on.

105
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:24,550
Crazy. God damn it. All right. I got it. Hold on. Oh, fucking hell. I don't know if I can do it.

106
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:33,800
I really don't think I can do it. It's too dumb. This is stupid, right? This is really dumb.

107
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:42,099
All right. I think I got it out of my system. I had to at this point. Okay. Here we go. You know

108
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:46,019
what? It's so loud. I just think of, okay, I gotta get it out. I gotta get it out now.

109
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:57,420
Because the whole thing is when the jumpscare happens, I'm going to fucking wake up and it's

110
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:03,019
going to be stupid. All right. This is it. I got it. Fuck the phone. It's going to be funny,

111
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:21,960
but fucking don't listen to it. Fuck you. I can't mute the phone call. It's so funny.

112
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,940
That's like the funniest part of this whole thing. Okay. All right.

113
00:38:26,940 --> 00:39:10,940
All right. I got to get it together. It's after the phone. I'll be, it'll be, it'll be good.

114
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:17,429
I just have to get through the phone. Once the phone bit is over, I'll be good. I'll be good.

115
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:22,710
It's just that phone part for real. It's

116
00:41:04,019 --> 00:42:25,849
Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:15,369
We got it. Well, let's look, there's a candle in my room. That was so hard to get through that

118
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:33,800
third ring. What happened? That was a rare death screen. All right. I don't care. I'm done. Streams

119
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:45,400
over. That's fun. That's fun. Yeah. It looks like there's a candle in here. I think that's,

120
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:54,550
I think that's the one you go on on. It does look like we could fucking blurry, doesn't it?

121
00:43:54,550 --> 00:44:01,559
Okay. All right, guys, that's it. I'll see you guys on.

122
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:14,679
There's a lot of shit going on. And I have to tell you really, really. All right. I really don't

123
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:22,739
want to say this, but it sucks. But I'm just, just in case baseball might need to move again,

124
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:30,900
not far, not far, but might need to move another few days. Would it would work in our asses off

125
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:39,820
to make sure that we can get what we need. But it's, it's happening within the next like 30 days.

126
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:45,449
Okay. I know I keep changing it, but we just keep having things that have to change and keep having

127
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:50,420
venue things that have to happen. And some venues need to change. And it's been a whole ordeal.

128
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:56,119
We're working on it. So I might have to change it by the way, green screen stuff you have until

129
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:01,719
the 18th at 1201 midnight to get your submissions in, go read the rules are in the discord right

130
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:09,420
now. What's the green, what's the green screen thing, dude, the green screen stream. We did a

131
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,739
bunch of shit in front of the green screen. There's three full streams of it. You can do

132
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:19,619
whatever you want with some rules and go read those rules. You're going to need them delaying

133
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:26,550
it to next year. No, no fucking way. That's not happening. All right. I'll, I'll see you guys in

134
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:31,719
a couple of days. Let's see. Maybe I'll see you guys on Tuesday. Yeah. 24th of July, probably

135
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:39,849
going to do something. Holly and I might do something. So, so I'll see you guys on the fifth

136
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:47,449
Tuesday. I have no idea what we're going to do, but I'm sure we'll do something. Thanks a lot,

137
00:45:47,449 --> 00:46:02,019
everybody. See you later. Take care of yourselves. Well, we got a few minutes, so we got some time.

138
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:11,699
Oh, you can do the mod day. Actually, what a great idea. Maybe I'll do that on Tuesday.

139
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:18,920
Just get a bunch of mods for a few games. It just apt to have an absolute puke stream. I think that

140
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:38,789
makes sense, right? Tuesday puke stream. I think it makes sense. Yeah. Oh, what was I going to say?

141
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:05,699
Elden Ring. Yeah. Okay. I got a question. Does Elden Ring have a bunch of mods? Are there fun

142
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:11,159
things to do with Elden Ring and modding? Okay. Because I got to have to take, I'm going to take

143
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:22,170
a look. What happened with the Elden Ring PvP? Honestly. Okay. So here's what happened with the

144
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:26,650
Elden Ring PvP. So I talked to Ludwig and I'm like, oh, hey, this, maybe we can do it with this mod.

145
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:34,099
And then didn't Twitch Rivals just kind of started doing it? Not necessarily the community

146
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,579
version, right? Maybe. No, they did sort of. So I was like, oh, I guess the tournament stuff

147
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:42,679
is already happening with Twitch Rivals. So I guess that's kind of what I was planning on doing

148
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:55,349
stuff like that anyways. So they're doing like, they did like a PvP thing. You can't really use

149
00:47:55,349 --> 00:48:11,800
mods online. Yeah. I got to be careful too, right? Also Dark Souls 3 has a bunch of crazy shit too,

150
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:21,559
doesn't it? That I never got to. I did the FPS mod. Did you ever revisit inscription? I did

151
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:32,280
off stream. I got to the third act off stream. It's pretty crazy. I did not beat it though.

152
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:49,269
What about the Outer Wilds DLC? I don't know. Maybe. I heard the Outer Wilds DLC was

153
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:59,900
kind of hard. It was like very specific or something, right? Speaking of Ludwig,

154
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,320
did you guys see the Mogul Money Live? God, that was fucking hilarious.

155
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:16,329
Uh, let me tell you, Ludwig really is, he's got, he's got some chops on him.

156
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:28,389
That was so funny. He did such an unbelievable fucking job. It's really awesome to see that

157
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:41,829
whole crew doing that stuff. So yeah, he's very sociable. He's just so, he's just, he just has it.

158
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:49,429
He just has it. Does he know what I'm talking about? He's just got it. He just has it. You know

159
00:49:49,429 --> 00:50:03,320
what I mean? Did you get your bidet yet? No. But then again, I never took a picture in a

160
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:14,760
Mega Milk shirt, so we're even. No, it was awesome. It was fun the whole way through.

161
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:25,420
But yeah, I'll talk to you guys in a couple days. We'll do some mod stuff and see you later. Thanks

162
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:31,210
for watching. You bet your ass I'm going to get this to exactly six hours. Exactly. On the dot.

163
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:39,239
There it is. All right. Good night. Call your mother. See you later. Take care of yourselves,

164
00:50:39,239 --> 00:51:14,460
guys. Have a great night.
