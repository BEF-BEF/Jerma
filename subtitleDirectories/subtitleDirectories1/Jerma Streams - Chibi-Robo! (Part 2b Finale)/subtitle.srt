1
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:25,100
I changed Twitch servers. Let's see if that does anything.

2
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:33,990
So the stream did turn off. Let's see if it continues to work.

3
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:45,560
Went to a different server. Dude, two streams in one day? What the fuck? Are you serious?

4
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,990
That seems barely stable. Let's hope it stays that way.

5
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:14,099
I think, I think it's okay. Let's continue. I'll give it a minute or two for people to realize

6
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:23,819
that we're live again. Remember, just got the notification you went live. Can't wait for

7
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:34,060
another eight hours of Chibi-Robo. All right. What happened? I just got back. The server I was

8
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:41,109
connected to was kind of fucked up, I guess. I'm just gonna let it ride out for a minute.

9
00:01:42,069 --> 00:02:00,780
Did you play off stream? A little. Just a little. Just a little bit. Can we get a free

10
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:12,039
wink for our troubles? Sure, why not? Where's the camera? There it is. I think we're good. I

11
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:41,449
think this is solid. Stream might not even turn off. F.A. lap. No drop frames? All right, let's go.

12
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:57,659
Where's that tuber light? Oh, all right. It's a waterfall training?

13
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:09,219
Yes, I want to do waterfall training. Of course I do. This will make your mind sharper than a

14
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:15,770
dagger and your body harder than steel. Listen up, I do not want to repeat myself.

15
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:29,770
March straight down this way, soldier. You'll eventually reach the waterfall.

16
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:36,090
Look at that guy up there having so much fun. When you get there, you'll have to climb to the

17
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:44,569
top and meet up with Private Prisco. So just run over there. Let's go. Dude, you peeked the mic.

18
00:03:45,849 --> 00:04:16,360
Easy. No, wrong item. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Climb waterfall. No,

19
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:28,089
you idiot. It's okay. Go like this. Put this shit away. Up. All right. Put it back up. Wait,

20
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:34,550
are they firing at me? Can I climb the vine? Climb the vine. You can't climb vines? I can't

21
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:59,610
climb the vine. Now what? Hello? What the fuck does he want me to do now? What the fuck is going on?

22
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:07,500
That wasn't him? I'm out of battery. I'm dead. Oh my God. I blame the fucking internet on this

23
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,209
bullshit. If I wasn't paying attention to the goddamn internet going down, this wouldn't have

24
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:37,100
happened. I just used my battery. I'll be on fiber like within the next 30 days. I can't fucking

25
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:45,939
wait. So this shit is impossible to have it happen again. Ever. Pain in the ass.

26
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,870
Five. I'm going on fiber. I just wasted that fucking battery. I'm going back to the save.

27
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:07,430
Right? I didn't even need to use that battery. I got saved by the bell. Where was that last save?

28
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:35,899
Did I not save after the no saves coming? It was before the jungle art. Really? God damn it. Really?

29
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:55,720
Imagine saves coming in chibi robo. Get me on that fucking fiber line.

30
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:59,720
I never have to think about this shit literally ever again for the rest of my life.

31
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:25,850
How much for a wink on fiber? Five dollars, man. Exactly five dollars. He thinks fiber is

32
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:32,170
different. Well, when you have a thousand, a thousand, there's a lot of leeway for you to not

33
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:53,639
have to drop frames streaming at six up. If there's a thousand up, there's a lot more room. I'm gonna

34
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:21,019
save it. Stop throwing shit at me. Who's doing this? All right. I'm going back there and I'm doing

35
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:48,309
this. I want to do it. It's television. It might be. Was there a wink? I didn't see one. Oh, there

36
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:56,179
was a bunch of money. Sorry. It happened during the internet bullshit. Five thousand bits came in.

37
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:06,620
I missed it. Thank you for the fifty dollars. And it was from Sukhoi Flanker. Thank you, Flanker.

38
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,289
Hello, Jeremy. Remember when you played stalker two years ago? You gotta finish that. It's too

39
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:18,889
good of a game to just forget. Oh, like stalkers. I think it's been too long.

40
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:29,590
I can't like go back to my save from two years ago and be like, all right, let's go.

41
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:34,389
That's that game's hard and unforgiving. I would have to redo the whole thing over again. I'd have

42
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:57,190
to start it over, which I mean, that's fine. He hates good game. He's gonna do it again. He's gonna

43
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:15,539
scream. What? Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. I was trying to be cute. I was trying

44
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:17,860
to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was trying

45
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,820
to be cute. I should have just jumped up. I was trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was

46
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,379
trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. I was trying to be cute. No more cuteness. Let's go.

47
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:39,210
Chichiburobo is not cute. He's cute, but he's not now. Let's go. Do an impression of Sarge egg. I did

48
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:47,370
one yesterday. I can't do another one right now. It would take like 10% of my soul to do it.

49
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:57,100
You delete like a year off your life when you do a Sarge impression. It's like smoking eight

50
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:29,299
packs of cigarettes. That's the toll it takes. All right, don't shoot me. Watch out. Behind the

51
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:58,889
waterfall. Climb it. Made it. Wow. I almost just fell off. Talk to him. Talk to him. Yeah.

52
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:23,720
Frog ring behind the waterfall. Thank you for your keen eyesight. All right. Got points. That's done.

53
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:31,509
That only took like 28 minutes to just do that one thing because of all the bullshit. All right,

54
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:42,519
now we can move on. We're going to do the thing we came here to do. Talk to him again. More training

55
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:54,389
to do. Look at the ring. Can I even get up there without their help? I've never been up there before.

56
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:12,629
What do you say? More huge bits from Sukhoi again. Flanker. A hundred dollars total.

57
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:22,409
Ten thousand. That's right. Ten zero zero zero. A hundred bucks total from Flanker. Flanker 35.

58
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:29,179
This dude just paid me a hundred dollars to play Stalker. Hold on. Let me read the message.

59
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,960
It might not even say that. They say you were at Dark Valley but you need to complete Stalker and

60
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,279
if you do not, I will continue bugging you about it till the end of time because I need more Stalker

61
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:56,039
content to watch and I love you and especially your Stalker Let's Play. All right. I have no

62
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:05,980
plans to play Stalker. A Stalker dono. No, no. All right. I have no plans to play Stalker.

63
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:12,419
Right now. I'm playing Mario Sunshine next week. That's gonna take like four days.

64
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:25,620
Play Stalker tomorrow. I'm not gonna play Stalker tomorrow. I was so bad at Stalker. I had no

65
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,929
patience. I wasn't very good at it. That's not my game. You want me to play a game that it was

66
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:41,529
embarrassing when I was playing it? And yes, I know I just failed Climb the Vine and Chibi-Robo

67
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:53,860
four times, but there's a difference. It's a big difference. I want to go to the I want to do the

68
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:16,470
the bridge in the kitchen. Stalker after Mario Sunshine. No, I have I have I have no idea.

69
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:23,190
The last time I played Stalker was it had to have been at least two years ago.

70
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:50,460
So you're saying that there is a chance. Well, I'd say more like one in a million. Dumb and dumber.

71
00:15:50,539 --> 00:16:20,220
All right, let's go. That's a classic line. What what's his name? Dermal only eats beyond burgers.

72
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:34,340
What the hell is your username? All right, let me get over here. What is that name?

73
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:43,029
Dermal only eats beyond burgers. Why? Why do you even have that name? That name is fucking crazy.

74
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:17,509
Sponsored content. Yeah, for him. Not for me. That's a lot of money. All right. Now,

75
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:23,609
what do I want to put the bridge over this way? Look it up there. Oh, I want to clean the grill.

76
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:34,789
Yep. Okay. Wait, I want to clean the grill. I'm going down. The fan of the grill. We plug in.

77
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:59,609
There's so much junk up in that fan. So much crap up in this man. I can't wait.

78
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:27,099
Let's get another 5000 bits. Holy shit. From Flanker again. Flanker. This is 150 dollars.

79
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:39,670
More than that. 200? Total? No, 150 dollars and bits. My god. You're a madman.

80
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:48,819
Derma, you were doing really good for the point at which you were at the game. I want to see

81
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:54,259
stalker. I am a stalker fanatic and I will not rest until you finish your stalker let's play.

82
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,259
I have nothing to say except that you were doing much better than most other players. Are you

83
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:03,059
serious? Wait, is this bait for me to do this? This is that's bait. That's for me to go like,

84
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,019
holy shit, I was doing better. And that's like a hard game. I'm doing better than players. I could

85
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:18,259
do that. Nice strategy. Where's all the junk? Where's all the crap? I want to clean this.

86
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:23,059
Why is this clean? I'm pissed off that this is clean. I came up here specifically to just get...

87
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:39,769
Why is this clean? I said this last night. I'll say it again. I never rule out ever playing a

88
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:48,230
video game. I don't have any plans for it. Who knows? You might see stalker appear on this channel.

89
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:55,269
Maybe. I refuse to say I will never play a single video game except for League of Legends. I will

90
00:19:55,269 --> 00:20:01,109
never do that ever. Literally never. Not one time on this stream. Or Dota. That will never happen.

91
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:12,309
Not once. But I will never say that I won't play a game on this stream. I can't climb this. So,

92
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:22,259
I don't know. I don't have a... It's not like, oh yeah, that game was terrible. I'm never playing

93
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:27,910
it. I just kind of get distracted by other things. New games. Something else happens. So,

94
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,670
you play something else. You get into something else. You forget about it. You lose track. You

95
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:41,819
stop playing it. Who knows? We might come back to it. I don't know. What about Doki Doki Literature

96
00:20:41,819 --> 00:21:15,799
Club? No, never. No, it's just not gonna happen. I just know it's not. You know what I mean? I know

97
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:32,099
it's not gonna happen. Now, what else can I do with this? It can't be just to get across to there,

98
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:39,509
right? There's got to be something else I can do with this. Oh, this is not even the bridge, Jeremy.

99
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:55,480
This is not even the bridge. How much higher can I get this? All the way up. On top of the fridge.

100
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:01,589
On top of the cabinets. Look at that. There's a demon door over there. Oh, yes. Come on. Keep

101
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:14,250
going. I can shoot that. I can shoot that thing. Flanker gave more money. Now, that's another

102
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:22,039
5,000 bits. That's $200 from Flanker. I don't want you to play Doki Doki Literature Club. I want you

103
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:42,119
to finish Stalker. I know, but I don't... I just say yes. I can't. I don't want anybody to think

104
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:51,029
I'm gonna play Stalker in like four days. I gotta be realistic with you guys. I need to move this

105
00:22:51,029 --> 00:23:05,099
forward. You already took the money. I didn't say... Hey, I... Hey, all right. Hold on. I'm gonna...

106
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:12,380
Defense mode. Shield going up. I never once said, please pay me hundreds of dollars and I'll turn

107
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:25,740
on Stalker. That was not part of a conversation. You don't negotiate.

108
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:58,150
He's face down in defense mode. I think Coolsville sucked. No, but I can't say yes. I don't know.

109
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:06,009
It's not gonna happen. I've gotta be real. It's not gonna happen anytime soon. Okay, that's it.

110
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,539
Could this happen in the future? I don't know. But will it happen now? No, it will not. It will not.

111
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:18,099
It will not. It's not gonna happen anytime soon. It will not. I just need to be clear.

112
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:42,119
I think I got a secret fucking entrance. Jerma Grinn. No, I also don't want to set the precedence

113
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:46,359
of somebody paying a bunch of money and telling me that I'm gonna play something and then I go,

114
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:52,950
you sure? You bet you. I don't want people to think they need to or will spend like a bunch

115
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,900
of money to make me play something on stream. If you got recommendations,

116
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:06,569
ruin the recommendation channel. I can't... I can't set the precedence of like, all right, hey,

117
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:14,140
let's do stalker tomorrow. Let's go, baby. It only costs $200 to make me play something.

118
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:35,430
There's a bandage over here. Who's hurt? Lobbyists. Video game lobbyists. Oh, yeah, yeah.

119
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:57,670
No, you know what I mean, though. Can I push this? I was told to come here for a stalker stream.

120
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:15,460
Jerma, the stalker... I'm not gonna read that out loud. But seriously, thanks for the ridiculous

121
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:29,190
amount of money. You've given so much money, too much money. Okay, there's another one over there.

122
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:35,210
All right, I gotta get back up there. All right, back up to what I did and I'm gonna go to get the

123
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:48,099
other demon door. No, I'm not playing stalker on March 13th. No, stop saying that. Looking

124
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:54,819
forward to Lisa the Painful on the 20th. None of this is happening. You're gonna be very, very upset

125
00:26:54,819 --> 00:27:16,279
to Lisa the 20th. Okay, first of all, you know how that's bullshit? I'll tell you how you know

126
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:25,369
that's bullshit. You think I'd plan out what game I'm playing that far in advance? That's what? No,

127
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:31,220
I figured out what I'm gonna play like two days ago. Like, I know what I'm gonna play tomorrow today.

128
00:27:38,069 --> 00:28:03,799
I need 197 more. You told us you had 30 streams planned out. Well, no, I have 30 streams worth of

129
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:12,900
GameCube Wii, Xbox 360, and PC games back here. I don't know what order they're gonna be in. I

130
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:27,819
just know they're gonna happen. No, stop tagging that account. Stop tagging. All right, all right.

131
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:42,680
I'm getting involved. I'm getting involved. I'm getting involved. I'm involved. I'm getting

132
00:28:42,680 --> 00:29:00,630
involved. I just sub only. I'm getting involved. Subs are doing it too. How could you do this?

133
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:11,220
You're supposed to support me. You're supposed to support me in everything. All right, let's go.

134
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,180
I'm getting involved. All right, we're gonna go back to the kitchen. I'm going up to the top.

135
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:33,369
Wallace and Gromit GameCube stream with too, too many fake fans.

136
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:58,390
You guys are fucking crazy. All right, I'm going back up because I want to get the other demon

137
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:07,400
door. Hey, why is the dog standing? Oh, it's a cleaning game first. Remember emote only,

138
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:26,309
sub only, emote only, 10 minute slow mode. I am in control. I am in control. Hey, get down.

139
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:45,859
Get down from there. What's wrong? Oh my God. I am in control. I'm in control.

140
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:54,359
People are getting thrown into a river around me. I'm in control. I'm in control.

141
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:18,660
All right, now take off emote only, take off sub only. Let's hear what the people have to say now.

142
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:46,970
Remember, remember who has the power here. Who pays the bills? Who pays the bills? Who pays the

143
00:31:46,970 --> 00:32:17,240
bills? Who pays the bills? I do. I'm a waiter. Who pays the bills? I do. I'm a waiter. I've been a

144
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:28,549
waiter for 15 years and holy shit, you should see my tips. 30% on every check. I'm a, I'm a people

145
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:56,779
person. I know how to talk to people. Oh, it's dad or me. What are you going to show us your tips?

146
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:15,779
Maybe one day. Help me chibi robo. Oh my God. No, this is a $300 video game request.

147
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:23,160
It's gone. It's, it's, it's over that, it's over that portion. Another hundred bucks to get me to

148
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:47,930
play stalker. I already know what the message is. Can't flanker insane, insane money, insane amount

149
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:56,259
of money. This is completely, you don't need to do this. Unnecessary. Don't worry. Unnecessary.

150
00:33:56,259 --> 00:34:03,700
Thank you though. Um, I don't want to set a precedent either, right? You can finish

151
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:19,690
Super Mario first. I just want to see stalker finished. No, no, no, no. He's setting terms.

152
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:34,579
There are no terms. There are no terms. I've been watching you since TF2 and I have to say

153
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:38,099
your playthrough up to that point was the most entertaining until it abruptly ended.

154
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:51,079
All right. I, hold on. I got a question. This is okay. Hold on. This is a very, very important

155
00:34:51,079 --> 00:35:13,300
question. Where, where have you been for two and a half years? I'm, why now? It's been a long time.

156
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,460
I like completely forgot about that game. That's why this is so, so, so hard for me.

157
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:40,150
He was waiting for the perfect moment. So about this stalker stream, I've already made my point.

158
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:45,929
I've already made my case. You don't have to give any more money. In fact, you do not give

159
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:53,989
any more money based on a stalker stream. I'm telling you, I really appreciate the huge fucking

160
00:35:53,989 --> 00:35:59,110
money. I really do. Thank you. It's ridiculous. It's a ridiculous amount of money. If anybody,

161
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:14,710
for any reason, I've taken your point, taken the feedback and I missed a wink. No, I didn't

162
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:24,579
pay him to play Sam and Max instead. Jenny said she's hungry, but I'm hungrier than she is. What

163
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:37,000
the fuck are you, dad? You get it? Come on, help me make some hamburgers. This is the cooking part

164
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:50,389
of the stream. Of course I will. Oh, sweet. A zillion things. Every time I hit the kitchen,

165
00:36:50,389 --> 00:37:07,110
I end up burning everything. Let's grill some burgers. Okay. How do you cook burgers? Prep work?

166
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:16,280
Do I have to help you set those buns on the plates? Why are you putting the bun on the grill?

167
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:25,940
They didn't even get toasted yet. Chibi-Robo, it's on the plate. Yeah, I know. You gotta leave it on

168
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:41,579
there for at least a few minutes. Is the grill, is the stove even on, dad? Dad, why can't you just

169
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:49,940
put these on? Way to go, Chibi-Robo. There's no way I could. Next, we grill the meat. Okay. I'm gonna

170
00:37:49,940 --> 00:38:05,000
get my fucking secret sauce on there. Get your spoon out. Use your spoon to flip the patty.

171
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:16,679
All right. Why is there only one painted on here? You have to label the burgers?

172
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:24,889
One, two. Is it five? Cook until both sides are brown. They'll burn if you grill them too long.

173
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:39,349
What, why are these two and, look for the three? All right, that one's done. Three and three?

174
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:55,909
All right, three. Pick it up. Flip this fuck. Three. All right, this is, wait, this is three.

175
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:19,670
Come on. Here's a three. Is it both three? Three, two, fuck. Oh, fuck, I gotta get this over here.

176
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:24,599
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Don't burn, don't burn, don't burn, don't burn, don't burn, burn, burn,

177
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:31,179
burn. I wonder if beef tastes good. I mean, it does. All right, is this three? Put it back down.

178
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:42,010
Is it three? It is. Oh my god, another hundred bucks just came in. Hold on a second.

179
00:39:42,809 --> 00:40:02,260
Hold on a second. Flanker again. How much money is this? This is like $400 from, hey, hey, hey.

180
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,460
They say no prob, this is a hundred bucks by the way. No problem, Jerma. I just love your videos

181
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:35,110
and I'm unfortunately broke right now. Give this channel money if you don't have any disposable,

182
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:45,369
super disposable income. I gotta make that real clear. Don't make yourself broke.

183
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,320
All right, here's the tier of where and when we should give this stream money.

184
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:06,460
Okay, tier one. It's tier one. So, okay, all bills are paid. You've eaten three times today.

185
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:13,030
You've got all the food, all your groceries paid, your rents paid, okay. You went to the

186
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:23,530
arcade and blew $50 with your friends. Okay, good. Under that. Underneath that. Did you pay

187
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:34,090
for Netflix this month? Okay, underneath that. I'll sit somewhere under there. Do not give this

188
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:42,570
stream any fucking money. And I mean zero. Zero. If it's not something that you can absolutely

189
00:41:42,570 --> 00:42:00,179
afford. For the love of god, please. That's reverse psychology. I have to be clear on this.

190
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:07,860
I don't want people to like make themselves broke because they're throwing fucking hundreds

191
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:15,059
of dollars at the channel. You know what I'm saying? I don't, I don't, that doesn't sit well

192
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:27,989
with me. Anyway, thank you for the huge money. Please take care of yourself first. Don't take

193
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:41,699
care of me until you take care of yourself a thousand times first. It's a psychological

194
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:55,050
mind game. No, it's a, it's just a reality game. Honey, Jenny, dinner. There's nothing on these.

195
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:12,650
Oh, we didn't put the lettuce on. And you banned people from donating. I don't, I don't think so.

196
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:22,980
I don't think you can. And his mom doesn't want any. Why?

197
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:32,139
It's more fun to eat together. Can I go deliver one? The dog gets a burger. I guess we'll give

198
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:45,130
her portion to tell. The dog gets a full cheeseburger. Oh, I forgot chibi robo. And oh,

199
00:43:45,130 --> 00:44:02,940
we can't eat. We don't eat with robots. Oh, that's right. I forgot. Let's eat one bite.

200
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:18,940
Wait, wait a minute. It's raw. Oh yeah. You got the cooking sticker. Oh, nice.

201
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:30,619
You really are amazing. Chibi robo. 20 happy points. 20 happy points. Yeah. How gave you,

202
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:44,469
oh, the dog gave me happy points too. Nice. I think I did everything in the kitchen.

203
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:50,519
Wait, no, the dog, the dog, the dog. Did I get all the things I wanted to get?

204
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:58,570
Got that. Did the cooking thing. I did. How many doors are there in here? There's three more. All

205
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:13,880
right. I'm going to do the beep beep boop boop thing. Hold on. The crumbs there. Now I'll clean

206
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:22,599
the grill. I always just want me to go. There's something apparently up there. I don't think I can

207
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:31,579
get up there. Can I? Maybe. Let's find out. Can I get up there? I was up with the, oh yeah,

208
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:41,820
I was up there earlier. I don't have the thing. Hey, Jerma, I'm doing huge out of the money

209
00:45:41,820 --> 00:46:12,730
options trading to sub to you. That's risky. Very risky. Huge out of the money options trading.

210
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:28,650
I'm going to plug in first. High risk reward. High risk reward. Don't, okay. Don't listen to me

211
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:42,780
when I do my joke streams about stock trading. Don't be like me. More money. How much? $50,

212
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:49,849
5,000 bits from ice likes rice. 50 bucks they say here from my SPY puts. What the

213
00:46:49,849 --> 00:47:09,929
fuck is going on? Look mom. Look what Jerma taught me about stocks. I didn't teach anything.

214
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,820
I told you that I got fucking messed up from beyond burgers. I fucked it up big time. Don't

215
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:32,039
listen to me. All right. Was that radar? But thanks for the $50. Thanks for the $400 fucking

216
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:36,599
dolls flanker. Thanks everybody. Thank you. Don't trade options unless you know what the

217
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,480
fuck you're doing. And I mean it. You need to know what the fuck you're doing. Don't just,

218
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,059
oh, you know what? I think, I think Tesla is going to go down. I'm going to put a bunch of

219
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:55,300
fucking puts on it. Oh, my money's gone in, in less than three days. Oh, well, I learned a few things.

220
00:47:56,179 --> 00:48:22,139
All right. What's up here? What should I invest my life savings into? I'm not going to save damn

221
00:48:22,139 --> 00:49:25,340
thing. What is this? Big? Shoot it? The fuck is this? Secret door? Oh, I know what's in my

222
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:45,139
portfolio. Any more secrets? No, nothing else in here. I got all the, there's two more doors that

223
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:53,769
I didn't get. What do you have in your portfolio? What wouldn't you like to know? I'll tell you.

224
00:49:54,489 --> 00:50:05,110
In my portfolio. Listen to me. McDonald's. I think that shit's going away anytime soon.

225
00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:23,800
McDonald's. That's pretty much it. 98% of my portfolio is in McDonald's Limited Group.

226
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:56,579
And then 2% into water stocks. Can I do this? I can. I just went right through it. Invest in

227
00:50:56,579 --> 00:51:09,750
water. Can I not do this then? It don't work. Guys, it don't work. It don't work. All right,

228
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:20,789
I'm out. Let's go to the next section. What do I want to do? What do I want to do? Climb up the jars.

229
00:51:21,429 --> 00:51:45,530
But I can climb the jars? The stream is now out of sync. It shouldn't be. I gotta charge. I can't

230
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:59,480
fuck around here. I gotta get up. It is. Okay. I can't climb up on these jars. What a lie.

231
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:07,420
Okay, I gotta go. What do you mean it's out of sync? The game's out of sync?

232
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:40,809
Video is slightly delayed after the audio. How's that sound? Better?

233
00:52:40,809 --> 00:53:08,630
It seems fine to me. Okay. All right. Now. Oh, dog. Right. I want to see what's wrong with dog.

234
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:46,380
Sing for us or else. What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? Dog, what do you want

235
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:58,860
from here? I can't do anything about this. Give the dog the bone? I can't even interact with dog.

236
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:19,320
Brain gang? No. No other secrets down here. I'm gonna clean up a little.

237
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:52,469
In his bowl. Does that, did that work? Did you give the dog the bone? I did not. Not yet.

238
00:54:53,269 --> 00:55:03,929
Haven't had an opportunity to. I'm gonna leave the kitchen. I feel like I've done a lot in the

239
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:18,360
kitchen. Almost at 3,000 happy points. What is the next actual thing? Right. So I've got this bandage

240
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:25,639
bone. The shoe! Oh, I keep putting it off. I gotta do this. I gotta climb the castle. All right. I

241
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:51,659
gotta, let's go. I keep getting sidetracked. You know how some games have Twitch integration?

242
00:55:53,619 --> 00:56:00,059
I keep feeling like that is the Twitch integration of this game. You guys say a command

243
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:17,449
enough times and it drops a fucking pan on me. Pan joke is getting old. All right. Let's do it.

244
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:39,449
It is in whose room? It's in her room. But let's do some happy points. Yay, Chibi.

245
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:44,199
You're a great cook, Chibi. We're best friends.

246
00:56:49,159 --> 00:57:09,860
Oh, I mean, Ribbit. How do you earn sad points? There are no sad points in Chibi-Robo. This is

247
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:37,480
the children's game. Bingo. All right. This thought I was going crazy. I looked over at the stream

248
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:43,059
uptime and I saw 57 minutes and I was like, holy fuck, this is the longest hour ever. I forgot about

249
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:51,880
the internet thing. 40 happy points for that.

250
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:12,090
Wait, there's a new picture? There is a new picture. Is it a clown? What is this?

251
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:38,219
Explain this. Tell me what this is. It's mom and dad. It's mom angry. Frog. I did. I already did.

252
00:58:41,659 --> 00:59:22,139
Sir, we have a problem. Report. Some men have gone AWOL. How could this be? Maybe it's all my fault.

253
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:32,409
I'm sure I was tough on him. It was only because I didn't want to lose any more men. But all that

254
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:44,739
did was make me lose him faster. Bunkerbusters, what have I done? I'm a disgrace. A soft-boiled,

255
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:53,239
undercooked disgrace. I'm not fit to be a fried egg sandwich. That sounds pretty good right now.

256
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:59,639
Troops dismissed, you're a disgrace to the name of Free Ranger and I'm not worthy to lead you. Wait,

257
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:38,659
I thought this was your fault. But a bonus. How? I gotta be close to another level up, right?

258
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:46,980
More battery upgrade. Remember, there's an existential crisis going on right now

259
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:53,289
and these prints can wait. Well, yes, there is an existential crisis going on.

260
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:13,579
Your happy point bonus is 40. Why so many bonuses? Because I'm just doing so good.

261
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:28,460
It's funny. I laugh. All right, let's go. Let's do it. Let's have the cleaning robot solve

262
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:48,179
everybody's problems. Oh, the day's gonna end. It's all right. He's laughing at his own joke,

263
01:01:48,179 --> 01:02:11,750
rested in sleeper. When did I? What? When did I do that? Laughing at my own jokes. I don't do that.

264
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:17,349
I'm not the first one to fucking laugh every time I say something. What are you talking about? I've

265
01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:26,389
never done that before. It's not like you could literally put me in a room by myself and I would

266
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:31,030
just entertain myself like next to the wall for like four days straight. It'd be fine.

267
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:38,179
Nothing wrong with me. No, no, nothing wrong with me. Something wrong with you.

268
01:02:47,860 --> 01:03:01,130
All right, day's gonna end. I might as well just let it play up. How crazy you are. Let me get some

269
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:19,860
private cargo reporting for duty. Hey, that's, that's what, what are they looking for? Dog tags?

270
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:40,949
No, it can't be. Those are Memphis's dog tags. You infiltrated the great airy monster's lair?

271
01:03:40,949 --> 01:03:58,119
Pipe down. What's going on here? Private chibi robo infiltrated the beast lair

272
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:03,960
and brought back Memphis's dog tags. What a bunch of hogwash.

273
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:29,659
Let me break. Let me see him. Memphis, I'm so sorry. I couldn't save you. I let you down.

274
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:47,619
Forgive me, Memphis. We will never defeat the great airy beast alone.

275
01:04:48,099 --> 01:05:10,179
We gotta pull together. Men, you're free rangers. You're hard-boiled. One for all. All for one.

276
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:24,900
You guys are the best. We owe a lot to Memphis because of him. The free rangers will come back

277
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:35,019
stronger than ever. Hold up for a second. What if Memphis is still alive? We gotta get cracking

278
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:45,880
and resume our training. Go, go, go, go, go. Anything else? So you survived an operation

279
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,360
into Tau's lair. For a scrawny house cleaning robot, you got a lot of guts. Bolts too.

280
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:55,239
You showed a lot of courage out there. That's why I'm asking you to do me a favor.

281
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:01,400
Help instruct our anti-Tau training. I, yes, I don't think it's time to do this today.

282
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:05,769
With you on our side, we'll have some serious manpower. Here, I mean, robo power.

283
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:17,960
Here, put this on. New costume. Tau's suit. It's a dog costume. Oh my god, this is so stupid.

284
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:26,820
Slap me with a battleship. You're even more hideous than the real Tau. The other boys will crack

285
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:44,650
when they see you. Head into the backyard. I don't have time for this. Listen carefully.

286
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:52,599
We're going to start our Tau training. Okay. This training will help us withstand Tau's

287
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:57,159
fearsome bark. Private chibi robo, in this exercise, you will play the role of Tau.

288
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,039
Press Z to bark and scare all the soldiers. When your battery's below 31, you won't be able to

289
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:09,719
bark and you'll fail. Do you understand? Do not waste your bark system only when several soldiers

290
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:50,780
are together. Okay, I think I got it. Let's go. Here comes the end of the day. Fuck! I was trying

291
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:58,920
to go fast. I was trying to go fast because the day was going to end. Well, I got the costume.

292
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:31,239
This is just Sylvester from Looney Tunes. We gotta go talk to mom. Bye, idiot. He was a cat,

293
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:37,670
by the way. That made you so mad. You're gonna just leave.

294
01:08:46,680 --> 01:09:01,449
Back to the chibi house. Try to dump all this into the giga robo thing. I'm gonna put all

295
01:09:01,449 --> 01:09:24,340
3,000 into it, yep. Can I rank up? Yes! 260. Excellent.

296
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:30,100
I need 730. That's a lot. I'm starting to get to the point where

297
01:09:30,979 --> 01:09:46,979
these are gonna come fewer and far between. I'm gonna do all 3,000. The whole thing. I do.

298
01:09:52,659 --> 01:09:53,939
One, two, three, bingo.

299
01:09:54,340 --> 01:10:18,229
More. Four. Another one. This thing's getting kind of close. Is it four more? 4,000 more?

300
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:26,170
Okay, cool.

301
01:10:36,329 --> 01:10:48,630
Get the chibi PC. Basement warp. Anything else in here? Brahma suit. Another battery. Space

302
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:58,090
scrambler. A remote control space fighter. Perhaps you can use it someday. What else to do?

303
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:07,659
Alright, let's go. Now, my number one priority right now is to go climb the castle.

304
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:14,649
I wanna climb the castle right now. I'm not gonna put it off anymore. I've been trying to do this

305
01:11:15,289 --> 01:11:22,939
the last two and a half straight hours of the stream. We're going. No one will put it off.

306
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:35,720
I need the D battery. I think it's over there. More like four hours. Probably. You're probably

307
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:47,180
right. Jeremy, do you ever find it difficult to balance streaming in your personal life?

308
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:56,140
No, not at all. Not at all. I take a lot of time off. The stream is only live about four times a

309
01:11:56,140 --> 01:12:09,180
week. So, I take plenty of time off. Because I have to. That's what I do. And that's how I do it.

310
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:25,539
Leaving trash. Leaving trash. I told you that doesn't matter. I have one priority. And that's

311
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:47,640
get to the top of the castle. But I do have. Actually, I do have some trash. I have a lot of

312
01:12:47,640 --> 01:13:09,770
twig. Nice. I have a lot of shit in my inventory, huh? I missed oldGermo. Oh, oldGermo on Twitch

313
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:16,329
who streamed six hours a week. Two or three days a week. Yeah. I know. Why don't we get that guy

314
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:29,109
back? Where's that guy? Can we get that guy back? This stream is like Overwatch for like half the

315
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:40,439
time. All right. We're going up. I missed the old SwindlerGermo. What do you mean Swindler?

316
01:13:40,439 --> 01:14:12,359
What are you? What? Get on his head. Come on, please. Yes. Yes. This used to be a main A stream.

317
01:14:12,359 --> 01:14:23,109
Now that's a true reference. All right. We're going to go up into the left. Going this way.

318
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:32,460
The battery goes on the right. Going over here. So this door. Where we go? All right. We've got

319
01:14:33,579 --> 01:14:38,470
check it out. I could push this and go up, but I don't think it's why.

320
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:49,109
Okay. We're fine. Nothing up here. Wait a minute. They might be. Pull it. No, you dummy.

321
01:14:49,989 --> 01:15:01,430
Might be able to jump up. That looks like a D battery. That's a D battery. Okay. I know where

322
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:11,270
it is. Can I climb from here? No. Okay. Go back down. I'm going to run out of juice.

323
01:15:12,069 --> 01:15:40,250
I'm going to look at it. Itching nose. Okay. Can I make this? Holy fuck. That was just barely.

324
01:15:41,770 --> 01:16:05,960
Now I'm going to knock this down with that battery. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, get out of the way.

325
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:17,850
I can't drag them. I have to drop down on it. What? Wait, hold on. Okay. I got to.

326
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:28,300
There's another battery. This is a battery here. Oh, fuck. Hold on. Can I like to stick this up my

327
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:37,350
nose for a second? You just astound me. The goal is within your reach. Go to the lovely princess

328
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:57,510
pits and deliver her red shoe. Um, to turn this on. This is where you insert a C battery. I have

329
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:07,659
to get. All right. I have the battery. I got to get down. Where does this go? Okay. The middle

330
01:17:07,659 --> 01:17:19,539
door opened. Good. I have to charge. Yeah. We'll do this again in a minute. Hold on. Stick it in.

331
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:27,000
Why are there so many kinds of batteries? Now you're asking the real question.

332
01:17:28,119 --> 01:17:33,880
Thank you. You are actually asking questions that people have been wondering for decades.

333
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,770
Why is it not just two or three types of batteries? Why is it like eight different

334
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:46,020
batteries? Why can't there just be one type of battery? Why does it need to be AAA or AA?

335
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:53,560
Why not just make them all small AAAs? I have D batteries. Why not just make them double A's?

336
01:17:54,199 --> 01:18:05,670
Different voltages. Why is everything? Everything should be the same voltage.

337
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:28,699
It's not that simple. I know. My God. He's a genius. Why didn't we think of that? Shit fucking

338
01:18:28,699 --> 01:18:43,720
slaps. Let me fix this. My Wii sensor bar just fell off the top of my monitor.

339
01:18:44,600 --> 01:19:34,140
All right. They're moving good. Let me guess. It's a C. Check the TV. I will later. Please,

340
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:37,659
Jerma, finish Super Mario Sunshine when you play it. I'm going to dedicate like a whole week to

341
01:19:37,659 --> 01:19:54,279
that game. So I definitely will. Okay. Now I'm assuming we're going to jump from one to the

342
01:19:54,279 --> 01:20:11,609
other. What's over there? All right. Come on. Let's go. No, you idiot. I had it. I had it. I

343
01:20:11,609 --> 01:20:38,979
gotta wait. I get the cord out of the way. All right. Then around this way. You're going to

344
01:20:38,979 --> 01:20:56,380
play James Bond for GameCube? I don't have it. I don't have it. Does it come all the way over?

345
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,579
Yeah. He definitely comes. Let's look at how slow this is. We have one opportunity right here.

346
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:23,220
And then we gotta wait till he goes all the way over to the right like this. Okay. Now

347
01:21:24,789 --> 01:21:29,829
shoot that from here. I think I just got the range upgrade. Good thing I got it because

348
01:21:29,829 --> 01:21:37,689
this probably would be impossible without it. This would have been impossible. I think I got it.

349
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:55,619
Princess, I'm here with your shoe. Oh, my red shoe. Thank you. Thank you.

350
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:30,859
Now I can go outside again. 33 happy points. Mort gave you 33 happy points. Yeah.

351
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:41,430
Now we can go back and talk to Mort. Let me introduce myself. I am Princess Pits.

352
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:47,779
I don't know who you are, but you have my undying gratitude. I had already given up.

353
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:52,260
I had resigned myself to spending the rest of my life in the castle.

354
01:22:53,220 --> 01:23:03,819
I mean, walking outside without my shoe? Please. That would be so icky. Anyway, thank you. If it

355
01:23:03,819 --> 01:23:17,899
isn't too much, would you be so kind as to tell me your name? Chibi Robo. This is Chibi Robo.

356
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:32,659
And my name is? You're the famous Chibi Robo? Telly. Excuse me for asking this,

357
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,500
but you wouldn't happen to be the one who's been bringing me flowers.

358
01:23:37,909 --> 01:23:50,140
Why, yes, of course it's been me. It's Mort, right? It's Mort. It's not me.

359
01:23:50,859 --> 01:24:06,550
I see. Then who could it be? A sweet damsel. Wait, it's not you.

360
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:17,659
Drake Redcrest. Hello. Can I help you? I found a flower in the backyard that was almost as

361
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:30,729
beautiful as you. It is a special present from Drake Redcrest for you. Mort, I tried.

362
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:40,649
Mort, I tried. Drake Redcrest, are you perhaps the one who's been bringing me flowers?

363
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:51,239
Those filthy things? I think not. Oh, I see. But I like these filthy flowers. Anyway, thank you.

364
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:59,340
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. What do I say? What do I say? What do I say to fix this? What

365
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:16,260
do I say to solve this? Perhaps justice demands filthy flowers. Excuse me. He just thought he

366
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:31,560
was a Chad. That was not a Chad move. Well, Princess Pits, if you'll excuse me. Chibi Robo,

367
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:54,920
please come and visit me again. Ew, gross. The toys are playing with her. Wait, what's going on

368
01:25:54,920 --> 01:26:20,119
with the TV? Circle, middle, radar. Hey, dickhead. You want to unplug the TV, please? Jenny's gone

369
01:26:20,119 --> 01:26:26,300
nutso. She hasn't been sleeping at night because she's all worried about her mom. She doesn't even

370
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:34,840
notice me dancing around here. I don't know how to speak rivetees. Holy fuck, you useless motherfucker.

371
01:26:35,479 --> 01:27:21,270
Get me up here. Turn the fucking TV off. Get this off. Talk to her. She's not gonna say anything.

372
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:28,069
Circle, middle, radar. Circle, middle, radar. Circle, middle, radar. I'm turning it off.

373
01:27:28,869 --> 01:28:04,680
Where does the radar want me to go? Turn this shit off. Is it aliens? Circle, middle, radar.

374
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:11,430
Okay. What's the secret thing that's pointing this way? I need to charge.

375
01:28:13,899 --> 01:28:22,920
I was just up there. I gotta go all the way up there again for the secret. Hold on.

376
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:34,060
Nice job ignoring my bits. Oh fuck, there was 50. Yeah, 50 dollars. Holy shit. Sorry, I was

377
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:46,789
fully immersed. 5,000 bits from Yes Is Online. Thank you, Yes. They say play the barnyard licensed

378
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:56,300
game on GameCube. Otis is my favorite, people happy. Otis barnyard licensed game. Barnyard?

379
01:28:56,939 --> 01:29:06,380
Wait, isn't barnyard like the animated TV? There's a TV show called Barnyard, right?

380
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:23,319
I don't know what barnyard is. What the fuck is barnyard? Barnyard. Yeah, this is a TV show.

381
01:29:23,319 --> 01:29:31,850
It wasn't a movie. It was a TV show before. It was a movie. It was right. It also had a Wii game.

382
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:46,199
Okay, I gotta go all the way up. I was just up there too. Barnyard movie came out first. Wait,

383
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:53,529
the barnyard? No, it didn't. It actually traumatized me, what you said. Wait, is that the one? There's

384
01:29:53,529 --> 01:29:59,770
a pig in it. The pig talks like this. Hey, the pig talks like this. Welcome to the barnyard.

385
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:24,310
No, that's Toy Story. That's the pig from Toy Story. Is there a pig in that show? Yeah, there is. What

386
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:58,170
does it talk like? All right. It's right here. Not quite. It's lower. Is it right here? Damn. Okay,

387
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:23,539
let's go. Nice. How many more? Seven in here. Okay, so we now we have to go use the radar. But look

388
01:31:23,539 --> 01:31:30,119
at all this stuff. There's lots of stuff in this room. Who's the dancing person? Purple crayon

389
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:48,819
zooming on this. What the hell is going on? Okay, we're going up. It's a pirate. Oh,

390
01:31:48,819 --> 01:31:54,949
shit. You're right. Can I make it from here? Is this a snorkel? Can I make this?

391
01:32:04,649 --> 01:32:20,119
Why is chat in slow mode? There was so much. There was so many people going like,

392
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:31,479
I had to turn it on. There's someone screams. All right, I gotta get better perspective. I can

393
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:41,859
probably get up there. I want that to the door. Sit on the mushroom. I did already.

394
01:32:43,060 --> 01:33:11,720
Did I get it? Let's go use the radar. Look at all this trash. Circle middle radar. Why does Jenny

395
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:22,260
just throw over mush all over trash under the bed? Circle middle radar. Wait, is it her doing this

396
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:48,180
or is it the mummy guy down here doing this? Okay, let me let's talk. I want to talk to you again.

397
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:59,640
Are you just like actually walking around? I gotta pee. It makes me upset. You ever in the

398
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:07,479
middle of something and you just have to pee and it just makes you angry? Who throws the word?

399
01:34:08,119 --> 01:34:37,159
Circle middle radar. Okay, I know. 30 points. Wait, it's a toy telephone. You might be able

400
01:34:37,159 --> 01:34:49,750
to talk to someone though. I can? I guess not. All right, I'm gonna leave here. I'm gonna plug in.

401
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:57,060
I'm gonna circle middle radar. I'm gonna talk to mom again. Go to the bathroom now. I'm all right.

402
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:10,920
I'm okay. There's enough time for me to plug in, talk to mom, and then go to the bathroom.

403
01:35:11,479 --> 01:35:29,609
Day's almost over anyways. There's a guy over here. All right, a lot of things just opened up.

404
01:35:29,609 --> 01:35:36,579
Let's just go talk to mom right now before time runs out. Use your Razor gamer diaper.

405
01:35:39,699 --> 01:36:12,359
Yeah, when it's full, you build XP. No. What level am I? 26. XP boost. Yeah, you just gotta

406
01:36:12,359 --> 01:36:17,000
go get a Mountain Dew. Peel off the XP booster and punch it in the code in.

407
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,760
It's 30% less urine you need to to level up.

408
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:47,590
Of course it does. You have to even ask that question? Of course it does. Okay, let's go.

409
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:51,609
See? Right here. Quick. To the point. Right here. Okay. Is the plan. I have a bandage. I have...

410
01:39:51,609 --> 01:40:07,449
I wanted to go talk to mom. Congrats on being in BG3. What's BG3? Time to water the garden.

411
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:27,239
Wait, what's dad doing out there? Baldur's Gate 3? Huh? BG3.

412
01:40:47,159 --> 01:41:17,180
Okay, dad. Let's do some lawn work. I'll take care of this. All right,

413
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:42,899
let's start playing the Michael Myers theme song for a second. Wait, wait, wing? Okay, hey.

414
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:52,420
You're watering the tree? What is he... Dad, you're spraying down the swing? What's wrong with you?

415
01:41:54,229 --> 01:41:59,100
Aren't you the neat freak, chibi robo? I won't be using that toothbrush again,

416
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:10,579
but if you're using it to clean, I'm fine with it. Watering the rocks. What a waste of water.

417
01:42:11,859 --> 01:42:16,229
I'm gonna do my best with the chores until Jenny's mom is in a better mood.

418
01:42:17,029 --> 01:42:35,979
Why are you saying Jenny's mom? I'm counting on you, chibi robo. Can I do anything in here?

419
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:28,939
Look at that secret door. It's a translation issue. I guess so. All right, any more secrets out in the

420
01:43:28,939 --> 01:43:40,739
backyard? Nope. Can I do anything with dad? I went all the way up to the top of the tree.

421
01:43:40,739 --> 01:43:52,500
There's a fucking weirdo up there. Remove the weeds. Oh, there's a weirdo up there. How do you

422
01:43:52,500 --> 01:44:14,170
remove weeds? Dig? Hold on. I gotta talk to the weirdo. Chibi robo.

423
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:21,369
If you stand there, you'll get all wet. That's dangerous business for a robot.

424
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:56,539
Stand back. You're not my dad. You actually are not my dad. All right, what's this weirdo doing up

425
01:44:56,539 --> 01:45:07,909
here? Keep it down, will you? We're not supposed to be talking right now. I am Macon. I'm training

426
01:45:07,909 --> 01:45:14,840
to become a pirate, sir. You are, sir. Watering the lawn is great. It's like I'm in a rain cloud.

427
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:23,109
Captain Plankbird is recruiting. Thanks for letting me know. Macon just gave you 26 happy

428
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:38,340
points. Oh, this is... you just have to tell them. Oh, there's a door over there. Hold on.

429
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:50,729
There's a door there and some shit over there. White block. I think I might need a tool to do

430
01:45:50,729 --> 01:46:31,260
that. All right, it's saying pull weeds, so pull these. Can I pull these up? Weeds. Weeds. Oh,

431
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:38,300
that's why everyone wanted me to pull up the weeds. Jerma, pull the weeds. No,

432
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:44,600
Jerma, you can pull those weeds up, you know. Jerma, the weeds can be pulled. Did you know?

433
01:46:44,600 --> 01:47:02,760
Cannot and day hot? What does it say? Cannot and today hot. Cannot and today hot. Well,

434
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:17,529
sunny out. It's been a while since I got any scrap. What does it say?

435
01:47:33,739 --> 01:47:41,159
So, I gotta go out here at night time. That makes sense. Now, what about over here? There's a little

436
01:47:41,159 --> 01:48:00,619
garden here. Can I plant the nectar flower here? Yes, I can. No, I can't. Plant the weed?

437
01:48:01,579 --> 01:48:11,670
I'm not gonna plant in weeds. All right, let's come back here at night.

438
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:33,819
Got it. I got it immediately. I'll come back here at night. Oh, wait, there is a bird up there.

439
01:48:33,819 --> 01:48:42,060
What does a bird eat? Bird seed? Do I have any food for the bird? Weeds, twigs, cookie crumbs,

440
01:48:43,020 --> 01:49:01,689
bones, a cookie, the nectar? Nectar! Will the bird eat the nectar? Gunpowder. No, that's not

441
01:49:01,689 --> 01:49:10,470
gonna happen. All right, yeah, let's feed the bird nectar. Gotcha. This game is so fun. I'm so glad

442
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:43,560
I got this game. This is great. This is really great. I like this. Sure, we'll save it. You got

443
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:50,630
not bought. That's where you're wrong. Start with the pirate emote. I did buy. I did bought.

444
01:49:51,350 --> 01:50:05,720
I do own. The ISO cost 100 bucks. No, I have the physical, video, game, disc, original,

445
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:12,439
in circulation. I have it. I own it, and it's mine. In 30 years, I'm gonna sell it for five grand.

446
01:50:13,079 --> 01:50:37,539
I showed it yesterday. It's in the Wii right now. Did it come with a case? Yep. This is original.

447
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:43,539
It's got the manual. It's got the case, and it's got the disc, and the disc is in liquid pristine

448
01:50:43,539 --> 01:50:54,199
condition. It is like crystal. No marks, no nothing. It is pristine. I'm gonna shrink wrap

449
01:50:54,199 --> 01:51:02,649
this fucking thing. When I'm done completing this game, it's going back in the case and getting

450
01:51:02,649 --> 01:51:18,899
shrink wrapped. Let's give nectar to the bird. You're scamming, scammering. No, I'm not gonna

451
01:51:18,899 --> 01:51:27,350
tell. That's not to... Hold on. What do you got? Ooh, chirp, chirp, chirp. Do I have to have a bird

452
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:44,069
costume to speak bird? Chirp, chirp. Okay. I think he's half asleep. Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

453
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:09,930
Yikes, I overslept. Chirp. You look at the time. I almost missed my date.

454
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:15,449
Holly will peck my eyes out if I'm late. Last time she plucked all of my feathers. I had goosebumps

455
01:52:15,449 --> 01:52:33,800
for a week. Thanks for waking me up. Chirp. You seem grateful. Way to go, Chibi-Robo. Now we can

456
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:41,270
keep going. We can get on the roof. We can get on the roof. It's roof time. Careful. Demon door.

457
01:52:45,079 --> 01:53:03,859
Oh yeah. All right. Anything else up here? Wait, let's break this. Two demon doors.

458
01:53:03,859 --> 01:53:08,520
There's a bunch of dirt up here. The bird shit. I'll get the bird shit in a minute too.

459
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:38,630
Clean. Save the battery. Can I fix this somehow? Um, can I get it? Just jump. Hold on. Can I get

460
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:53,500
across this? Boy. No! What just happened? What? I was trying to shimmy. What the fuck? The camera

461
01:53:53,500 --> 01:54:02,199
moved a little. The camera moved and it... That was weird. All right. Hold on. Let me charge up

462
01:54:02,199 --> 01:54:24,710
again. So LOL bad. Oh, he's blaming the camera. Fucking the camera's fault. The camera sucks.

463
01:54:26,619 --> 01:54:41,380
Oh, I just... I wasn't expecting it. I was shimmy. Fake gamer. I'm not even a real gamer.

464
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:48,949
I used to be. I was so good. Did you see my TF2 one live gameplay when I got like 28 kills?

465
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:56,539
One life. I used to be so good. I had like 37 kills in one life as a demo man. Oh,

466
01:55:00,359 --> 01:55:11,060
you're just old now. That's what happens. Oh, but man, back in the day. Oh, I'm so good.

467
01:55:11,779 --> 01:55:15,430
I'm gonna walk behind him because I don't want that cut scene to trigger again.

468
01:55:15,989 --> 01:55:26,439
Oh, that's what happens when you when you beat Sekiro. When you beat the last boss in Sekiro,

469
01:55:26,439 --> 01:55:29,640
I'm doing that because I just want people to think I still kind of got it.

470
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:34,779
That's what I thought. What are the purpose? Does that serve? This is how you guys know

471
01:55:34,779 --> 01:55:58,489
that I still kind of got it. And this game is like 100 bucks on eBay. We'll just wait

472
01:55:58,489 --> 01:56:13,460
till you type in, uh, cubivore. Check that one. I don't, I don't have that one. I do not have that

473
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:42,060
one. You're back? Get out of the way. Oh, you again. I thought you died. I thought you fall

474
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:52,199
off the roof there. Figured you'd never gonna come back. You got anything to eat? Cookie crumbs.

475
01:56:52,840 --> 01:57:09,289
Oh, get out of the way. That's what I wanted to eat. Mm. Tap you a little one. Uh, and it made

476
01:57:09,289 --> 01:57:20,470
them big. All these crumbs have made me thirsty. This is going to ruin my singing voice. Water's

477
01:57:20,470 --> 01:57:40,699
good, but I much prefer the sweet nectar of a flower. All right, we have that. Just fall off

478
01:57:40,699 --> 01:57:56,010
again. All right, let's not fuck this up again, please. Awful wink. Want a refund. There's no,

479
01:57:56,010 --> 01:58:20,220
there are no refunds. Okay, this is what happened last time. The camera went, here we go. Oh, look

480
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:47,050
at all these trinkets. 10, 15. Nice. I got to 75k. No way I'm going to use it on a mere blink.

481
01:58:47,050 --> 01:59:04,060
2250. All right, how many more? There's one more door out here. Isn't there one right here?

482
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:10,119
Wish I could zoom out. Can I zoom out? Kind of, not really. Where is it? It's like on the wall,

483
01:59:10,119 --> 01:59:38,069
right? Right here. Where is it? I remember seeing it. Is it right? Where is it? Oh, cube. White block.

484
01:59:38,069 --> 02:00:07,100
Now where is that other door? There it is. Okay, right there. I'm going to shimmy across the drop

485
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:35,260
of the dork variety. Yeah, I got all the doors in the backyard. No more. Eight out of eight,

486
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:40,659
completed. Backyard's pretty much done. Oh, I do want, I want to get the bird nectar. We'll do

487
02:00:40,659 --> 02:00:59,029
that too. Let's close that out. This is a real gaming hours. Yeah, I guess so. Am I going for

488
02:00:59,029 --> 02:01:10,699
100%? Um, yes, but not on the way you think. I'm going for 100% personal fulfillment. When I've had

489
02:01:10,699 --> 02:01:17,369
enough and I'm done and I want to complete, I'm going to complete. That's my 100%. That might

490
02:01:17,369 --> 02:01:30,420
mean do a shitload of side quests. Maybe not all of them, but enough of them. You sound like my

491
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:47,189
youth pastor. It's the 100% happiness run. That's happened 14 times. Yes, it has. Can I get up there

492
02:01:47,189 --> 02:02:18,060
before the day is over? I'm going to be close. Probably not. Hurry, hurry. Gibi robo, get away

493
02:02:18,060 --> 02:03:04,069
from there. Sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep. Sheep, sheep, sheep. Go so close. Stop. Go.

494
02:03:07,659 --> 02:03:22,550
Nectar. Hey, look what I got. Yay, nectar. Glug, glug, glug. That really hits the spot.

495
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:28,090
Nothing beats natural nectar. Chirp. You've been great, but I need one more thing. I've been eating

496
02:03:28,090 --> 02:03:33,449
a lot of junk lately and need some veggies. See any around? Balanced diet is important. If you

497
02:03:33,449 --> 02:03:37,689
don't have your health, you don't have anything. You don't look so good yourself. Try not to work

498
02:03:37,689 --> 02:03:46,569
too hard. I came to this town so that everyone could hear my lovely voice. Weed. Should I give

499
02:03:46,569 --> 02:04:02,939
them weeds? Counting on you to get me my veggie. I have weeds. That's dumb. I have to do it again

500
02:04:02,939 --> 02:04:27,340
tomorrow. Maybe a twig? Maybe. Make them a Sisu salad. Seed? We'll find out. It's either weed,

501
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:42,039
twig, or some kind of seed. Waiting for the countdown now. Dang. Come up with that connect,

502
02:04:42,039 --> 02:04:59,300
Jerva. I'm going for it. Birds eat sticks? Well, birds eat seeds and, I don't know, leaves?

503
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:15,130
Bugs? Birds don't eat sticks. Birds do not eat wood. They don't do that.

504
02:05:16,090 --> 02:05:31,109
I'm gonna save my money. There's only one thing I can buy. It's the spaceship. Does the basement

505
02:05:31,109 --> 02:05:34,949
warp? Warps you from place to place. Placed on both ends of the stairs. Yeah, I just get it.

506
02:05:35,909 --> 02:05:48,619
Woodpeckers don't eat wood. Yeah, I know. They're not eating it. They're borrowing.

507
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:57,930
They're borrowing to eat bugs. They're making a hole so they can eat the bugs out of the hole

508
02:05:57,930 --> 02:05:59,770
that they're borrowing with their nose. They don't eat wood.

509
02:05:59,770 --> 02:06:20,899
The utility bots just gave you a hundred happy points because I did it all. You got the utility

510
02:06:20,899 --> 02:06:34,310
bot sticker. You really are amazing. You've done it all. You're the best. I actually need to look

511
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:41,500
at the stickers. I haven't seen them. Scrap trade? Exchange rate. One scrap equals one. Oh, so now

512
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:50,039
I've gotten to a point where I bought everything. The space scrambler and chibi battery. I'm not

513
02:06:50,039 --> 02:07:17,420
gonna buy either one of them. I'm like one sub. All right, it's night time. You know what that

514
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:45,779
means. Back outside. Do the radar. Is the bird there? The bird's sleeping at night. He's up there.

515
02:07:47,109 --> 02:08:50,979
I'll do that after. Am I calling a UFO? Wait, they're all robots. They look just like me.

516
02:08:50,979 --> 02:09:11,180
I don't speak alien. I need an alien costume. I don't know what they're saying. Oh, what? I don't

517
02:09:11,180 --> 02:10:01,289
know. Alien council. Should I say yes? Yes. I asked you if you liked pineapple on pizza. Well,

518
02:10:02,250 --> 02:10:11,369
was that you chibi robo? What do you mean was that me? You're losing it chibi robo.

519
02:10:11,930 --> 02:10:16,380
I only asked you that to test you. Get a hold of yourself bot. Those were aliens.

520
02:10:16,939 --> 02:10:19,579
I've seen them on tv but this is the first time I've seen them in real life.

521
02:10:26,199 --> 02:10:35,670
They're smaller than I would have thought. They were very shiny but their voices were so quiet

522
02:10:35,670 --> 02:10:41,670
I couldn't make out what they were saying at all. Oh, I know. I'll ask Citrusoft if they have a

523
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:51,829
chip that can help you hear their voices. Well, they're gone. They've left. Maybe Citrusoft can

524
02:10:51,829 --> 02:11:12,380
give us something. Okay. Now what? I have a bandage. The bone. The weed. Bird. Is he sleeping?

525
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:29,909
I'll wake him up and feed him. First thing I see in chat is what I'm going to eat tonight for food.

526
02:11:30,869 --> 02:12:04,060
Is it an egg? No. No, I don't think so. It was eggs but I really don't want to eat eggs. Hey,

527
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:18,439
I'm back. Don't you have a way to speak to animals? Wait, this is the way to talk to all animals.

528
02:12:18,439 --> 02:12:28,090
So why is the frog suit just frog? I need a vegetable that's super duper nutritious. It

529
02:12:28,090 --> 02:12:41,500
might be pretty tough to find one but I'm sure there's one nearby. Okay, anyone that's super

530
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:45,659
nutritious? I might be pretty tough to find one. I'm sure there's one nearby.

531
02:12:51,989 --> 02:13:13,180
I don't have it. Eggplant? Eggplant? Where's there an eggplant?

532
02:13:15,529 --> 02:13:18,359
What about over here? I'm going to sneeze.

533
02:13:25,289 --> 02:13:56,409
Your head. Nutritious eggplant. There ain't nothing here. Looks not on your thousand dollar mic.

534
02:13:57,050 --> 02:14:09,449
Wait, hold on. There's a spot up here. Remember I was trying to figure out what the hell to do

535
02:14:09,449 --> 02:14:26,569
with it? I mean, this might be a shot in the dark or whatever. It was a little patch somewhere

536
02:14:26,569 --> 02:14:37,479
over here, right? Where is it? Up into the right. There's a little spot. Where is it? Am I crazy?

537
02:14:37,479 --> 02:14:46,460
I think I'm, yeah, I'm crazy. No, I'm not. It's over here, right? It's right there, right there.

538
02:14:46,460 --> 02:15:07,619
Yeah, I know. I'm not crazy. What the hell is this? There's nothing. I really can't get in here.

539
02:15:07,619 --> 02:15:31,670
Oh, maybe not. I guess it's not.

540
02:15:36,939 --> 02:15:50,260
Oh well. This has to be here for a reason though, right? What else will this be here for?

541
02:15:51,699 --> 02:16:14,550
Oh well, okay. I'll just come back later. Let's move. The next order of business is...

542
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:33,159
What is the next order of business? Go back to the, and get the chip.

543
02:16:33,799 --> 02:16:44,020
I think I didn't spend any money. All right, can I talk to the dog? I can talk to the dog with this

544
02:16:44,020 --> 02:17:00,260
on. Let me go see if there's a new chip. I could hardly believe my eyeballs when I saw those aliens.

545
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:04,500
Shocking, simply shocking. I couldn't quite figure out what they were saying. They were speaking so

546
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:11,139
softly. I almost forgot. I think Citrus Soft makes a chip that would allow you to hear soft voices.

547
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:20,069
I'll contact them right away. I knew they had something like this. It's called an alien ear

548
02:17:20,069 --> 02:17:35,620
chip. But they know. How much is it? Okay, we'll bring it back. All right, let's go.

549
02:17:36,579 --> 02:18:00,629
That can't be more than like 2,000. 2150 alien ear chip. Fine. So let's go back out there and

550
02:18:00,629 --> 02:18:12,309
do it again. Maybe I can actually hear them this time. Maybe if I, uh, maybe the first thing in

551
02:18:12,309 --> 02:18:23,100
chat that's not an egg is a food item. I'm going to eat pizza. Okay. Thanks for playing.

552
02:18:23,739 --> 02:18:52,360
It was pizza. I said hash house at gogo. Yeah. And you are one of the smartest people in this

553
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:58,379
whole room. You have to be. You have to be one of the smartest people in this whole chat room.

554
02:18:59,479 --> 02:19:08,010
Absolutely. 1000% positive. All right, let's go. I have the chip installed. Let's see if we can do

555
02:19:08,010 --> 02:19:23,319
this again. Oh, so we're stupid. No, I just said that that person was one of the smartest people

556
02:19:23,319 --> 02:19:30,170
in the room. Look, if somebody was in this room right now and had 155 IQ, I'd be like,

557
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:34,729
you're smarter than me, but I'm smart. Like if I have 140, that doesn't make me stupid. That

558
02:19:34,729 --> 02:19:41,299
doesn't make you the smartest person in the room. Why are the frogs back? Oh, fuck. I have to talk

559
02:19:41,299 --> 02:19:57,860
to them with a frog suit. Thank you so much. Long time no see chibi robo. Can I ask you something

560
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:04,489
ribbit? It's been so dry here lately. This keeps up our minds and bodies will scribble up like

561
02:20:04,489 --> 02:20:08,729
disgusting prunes. Well, you weren't out here when dad was spraying water making giant puddles

562
02:20:08,729 --> 02:20:17,639
everywhere in mud. This is over the last full day. We need to stay moist the frog way. We used to

563
02:20:17,639 --> 02:20:23,700
bring the rain with a rain ritual. But now there are only two of us and we need three frogs to do

564
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:34,569
it. Can you help us with our rain? Yes, of course. I would be honored. Let's do it. The rules aren't

565
02:20:34,569 --> 02:20:41,340
easy. Adjust your timing so that you crouch at the same time as us with Z. Watch our movements

566
02:20:41,340 --> 02:21:01,450
carefully and get the timing right. Let's go. We're doing it right now? Wrong. When we crouch

567
02:21:01,450 --> 02:21:29,530
together, press Z at the same time. He's fucking up too. Don't get mad at me. He did it. You did

568
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:52,500
it before alone. So why are you only mad at me? I love the sounds. They're so good. A healthy snack

569
02:21:52,500 --> 02:22:04,659
and a grow from that garden. Yay rain. Thank you chibi robo. You are so welcome. It's not only

570
02:22:05,219 --> 02:22:19,670
just for frogs. I bet the flowers are happy too. 100 happy points. You got the frog sticker.

571
02:22:21,159 --> 02:22:32,340
Their whole arc has been completed. Frog arc complete. Now I think there might be a healthy

572
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:46,739
snack over there. Let's go look at the stickers. There's one right here. Frog. What was I doing

573
02:22:46,739 --> 02:22:58,940
here? Oh yeah, this. All right, come back. I'm back so I can actually understand you.

574
02:23:04,090 --> 02:23:10,489
Now it's daytime, isn't it? It's technically the morning. Is it because of the suit?

575
02:23:11,450 --> 02:23:41,500
That's because it wasn't the frog suit on. We're back. Aliens. Wow, wow, wow. This is the first

576
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:51,139
time I've seen one in real life. We are aliens. We are here to see friend. We made promise to

577
02:23:51,139 --> 02:24:02,299
friend. Must see now. Are you friend of friend? Where is friend now? Are they talking about the

578
02:24:02,299 --> 02:24:07,879
they're talking about gigajad? Chibi robo, let's show them the way to their friend.

579
02:24:08,819 --> 02:24:18,139
Yes, way to go chibi robo. Keep this up and we'll be at the top of the chibi robo rankings. Do your

580
02:24:18,139 --> 02:24:30,010
best. All right, everybody get inside my head for a little bit. You watch ship. We follow you. Thank

581
02:24:30,010 --> 02:24:44,649
you. A little stingy on the happy points. Lo just gave you six. Ganymede just gave you six. They're

582
02:24:44,649 --> 02:25:04,579
all Jupiter moons. Wow, wow, wow. Chibi robo, the aliens gave you happy points. Titan, Titan, Lo,

583
02:25:04,579 --> 02:25:15,020
Lo. Ganymede, Ganymede. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I know. Wait, I'm bringing them through

584
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:20,659
the house. Guys, this is not really how this works. Usually how this works is you get inside my head.

585
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:31,620
All right, we gotta go. What if the dog kills them? All right, follow me. Wait just a minute.

586
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:45,459
Who decides what is justice and what is evil? What is justice? What is evil? I don't know. You

587
02:25:45,459 --> 02:25:52,780
cannot fool me disguising yourselves as space hunter robo. I know you've come to annihilate this

588
02:25:52,780 --> 02:26:04,469
world, hideous extraterrestrial friends. I must stop you somehow. Space hunter robo, I don't want

589
02:26:04,469 --> 02:26:11,739
to believe that you're an agent of evil. However, if evil exists, justice will defeat it. That is

590
02:26:11,739 --> 02:26:25,459
what justice is all about and I am the hero of justice. All right, push him into the beam.

591
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:44,870
Space hunter drake redcrest. Not a guess, not a guess. Humiliation is a cruel mistress.

592
02:26:46,120 --> 02:27:00,340
I seem to have run out of gunpowder. I'll let you go. Your day is numbered. Adios. I have that.

593
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:18,709
What was that? That was cool. Alien is amigo. I want to meet amigo. Let's go. Drake redcringe.

594
02:27:20,229 --> 02:27:26,149
All right, we need to go to the basement. Basement. Basement. The quickest way to the

595
02:27:26,149 --> 02:27:34,340
basement is foyer. We got to watch out for the dog. Follow me. And if you see any trash, pick it

596
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:50,409
up. That's what we do over here. That's what we do on earth. It looks so happy when I pick it up.

597
02:27:50,409 --> 02:28:10,120
They do a jumping jack. It's me and the boys. Shadow clones. Okay, foyer. What about the...

598
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:17,430
Are we going to get attacked by the eggs? Let's go. Come this way. Let's avoid a conflict here.

599
02:28:29,190 --> 02:28:32,870
I wanted to pick this up, but I was going to hang out for a minute. Come take a seat.

600
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:41,540
Come see your friend. Hey, wait. Can you... Does your ship have 4,000 power by any chance?

601
02:28:42,180 --> 02:29:01,270
I just went to the kitchen. Oh, you sure don't? I thought you knew where you were going.

602
02:29:02,229 --> 02:29:10,469
GP robot, why is the GPS turned on? You've been down this road 2,000 times. I know. I know. Shut

603
02:29:10,469 --> 02:29:45,510
up. Just fucking have it on it, right? Oh, look. Wait, don't touch that. Look who I got. Okay, so

604
02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:54,379
you ain't the fighting kind of alien. Okay, good. You're the exploration aliens. I couldn't have

605
02:29:54,379 --> 02:30:10,760
gotten to one group of fighting aliens. Friend, pal, buddy. Uh, he's dead. I forgot to mention

606
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:19,909
that. He died like 30 years ago. Did I tell them that before we came down here? Thank you. Thank

607
02:30:19,909 --> 02:30:41,530
you. 33, 33, 99 points. Your achievements are already on a universal scale. We came to fulfill

608
02:30:41,530 --> 02:30:57,270
our promise. What did you do to our friend friend? Yeah, I'm working on that. I'm working on putting

609
02:30:57,270 --> 02:31:06,569
them back together. It's been slow going. You see that there's like a divorce going on. I know

610
02:31:06,569 --> 02:31:10,569
there's like intergalactic shit going, but like there's a frog girl up there I had to give rings

611
02:31:10,569 --> 02:31:24,649
for. It's been a long process. I paid off the rockets. Ally immobile. Is savior sick? Is mate

612
02:31:24,649 --> 02:31:33,139
cold? Yeah, shut your core colors for a second. Are you asking about Giga Robo? Hey, he's as stiff

613
02:31:33,139 --> 02:31:52,329
as me beard. Friend has stopped. Friend does not move. Friend has died. We promised. Friend,

614
02:31:56,360 --> 02:32:21,059
we are too late. We are sorry, friend. No good. Sad. Are you all grieving for me shipmate Giga

615
02:32:21,059 --> 02:32:34,979
Robo? What a kindly bunch of critters you be. I can't stop me tears. Tears are all tiny oceans

616
02:32:34,979 --> 02:32:42,809
of sorrow. Tears from a poem I penned once. I forget I said that. Pirates don't write poems.

617
02:32:43,530 --> 02:33:01,030
Just another part of the pirate's code. I'm sorry. I'm okay. We leave the part. Withdraw.

618
02:33:09,459 --> 02:33:53,879
I hate your fucking vacation. I'm crying. You're crying. Well, we just have to bring him. We have

619
02:33:53,879 --> 02:34:00,600
to charge him and then bring it. Okay. I'm not here. How much money do I have? We just have to

620
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:06,309
charge him back up, bring him back to life, and then bring the aliens back down. It's that simple.

621
02:34:06,309 --> 02:34:37,020
It's so it's a very easy simple equation. Go gamble for 4k. What's going on over here? Help

622
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:53,239
instructor. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How do I like the game up to this point? I think it's a

623
02:34:53,319 --> 02:35:15,299
so like I think it's a solid it's 6.1 6.2. No, this game's fucking awesome. It's so good.

624
02:35:15,299 --> 02:35:39,799
It's amazing. It's like, I don't know. It's very good. Come on, bunch up. All army K.O.

625
02:35:39,799 --> 02:35:48,100
Tao training cleared. I think it's fantastic. I love it. Thanks to you, my men are ready for

626
02:35:48,100 --> 02:36:02,250
the worst. They're prepared to face the great furry evil. I think I've upgraded. Our training

627
02:36:02,250 --> 02:36:07,530
is over. We gotta come up with a plan to save Memphis. Once we've drawn up our battle plan,

628
02:36:07,530 --> 02:36:11,530
we'll be ready to take on the great hairy threat. We'll need you when the time comes.

629
02:36:12,649 --> 02:36:20,979
It's time we take the fight to the enemy. It's time we Romnibus Romnibus, whatever that means.

630
02:36:20,979 --> 02:36:36,200
Help us take down the tyrannical Tao. Let's talk to the dog. I think we need the dog side of the

631
02:36:36,200 --> 02:37:13,989
story. I don't have time to do anything else. Centrist. What a centrist. You, I remember you.

632
02:37:13,989 --> 02:37:19,879
Go join the pirates. They're looking for people. Hey, yeah, word is you got a hot rod.

633
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:28,420
How about a little game of chicken? Game of chicken. But you want me to drive and you want

634
02:37:28,420 --> 02:37:35,260
to drive into each other. Why would we do this? Whoever stops closest to the edge wins. Press B

635
02:37:35,260 --> 02:38:02,010
to slam on the brakes. What? I'm not driving the car. Okay, the brakes take a little while.

636
02:38:02,010 --> 02:38:19,379
Oh, GV Robo. Take this, you crazy robot. Let's do it again. Yes. All right. I thought it was

637
02:38:19,379 --> 02:38:42,020
going to be hit and stop immediately, but you have to, okay, I get it. This really is a great,

638
02:38:42,020 --> 02:39:01,909
this really is a great Wii game that came out 500 times. Oh, come on. He's giving me 50 bucks.

639
02:39:01,989 --> 02:39:11,940
Can I just grind this 50 dollars every time? I stopped that pretty quick. I stopped that.

640
02:39:16,549 --> 02:39:32,120
Almond or wifi. Does this work? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond

641
02:39:32,120 --> 02:39:43,420
or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Almond or? Good work. I had to have done it. Not

642
02:39:43,420 --> 02:39:58,940
terrible. Pretty close. Let's see. Oh, you did. D. How did I get a D? That was so good.

643
02:40:01,379 --> 02:40:12,500
Give it a rest, man. Come back later. How was that a D? That was, that was, that was so good. That was

644
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:40,229
so, well, that's kind of not fair. I got really close to the edge. I was almost over the edge.

645
02:40:53,510 --> 02:41:10,360
I'm pissed off. Let's go into mom's room while I have some minutes here. Here this game is three

646
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:49,500
games and then a final grade. Oh, there's something here. Later. Is this the Almond or wifi streamer?

647
02:42:02,069 --> 02:42:14,389
Mom, wake up. You have something for me. Give me the cool costume. You were knitting me a sweater.

648
02:42:14,389 --> 02:42:23,510
No, thank you. I can't. House of fun. Who am I? Who am I? House of fun. House of fun.

649
02:42:39,899 --> 02:42:44,540
No, thank you. I can't eat anymore. I just tried to bark and it didn't do anything.

650
02:42:49,020 --> 02:43:07,500
Good house. Jenga. Who are you? Who are you? House of fun. Hey you.

651
02:43:17,750 --> 02:43:24,729
Hound dog. I saw him trying to bite off his own tail once. He was a sweet little puppy though.

652
02:43:24,729 --> 02:44:00,979
All he needed was his doggy bone to make him happy. The suit... іi don't think i can get up

653
02:44:00,979 --> 02:44:20,579
any higher. You know, it's easier to forget that the point of this game is picking up candy wrappers.

654
02:44:20,579 --> 02:44:27,510
that's what i'm saying people give me shit for cleaning that's on the front cover of the box

655
02:44:28,229 --> 02:44:35,260
i'm with a vacuum cleaner no it's not it's him carrying his plug on his head i don't know i

656
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:44,379
thought i was with a vacuum cleaner but i can't do it's too i can't do anything in here all right

1380
06:20:42,700 --> 06:20:46,540
our country has recently been consumed by the white hot fires of chibi robo mania

1381
06:20:47,900 --> 06:20:51,500
and whether you know it or not this passion casts a dark shadow on our everyday life

so now go live to sunny mary where they're sunny

1383

1384
06:21:03,459 --> 06:21:08,900
more than clean floors and clutter-free lives it is also placing a severe demand for the local

1385
06:21:08,900 --> 06:21:15,080
power supply sources tell fox news that if chibi robots continue to fly off the shelves

1386
06:21:16,840 --> 06:21:21,080
power demand will outstrip supply and send the region into a panic of unfathomable

1387
06:21:21,720 --> 06:21:25,880
panic we predict rioting looting and perhaps the end of civilization if you know it ron
