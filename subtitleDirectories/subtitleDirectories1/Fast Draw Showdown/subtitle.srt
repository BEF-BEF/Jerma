Quick Draw! Fast Draw! It's a cowboy's world in the Wild West. Which one has the skills

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:23,600
to pay the bills? In this week's episode installment of... Fast Draw! Showdown! Only on the Nintendo

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
Wii!

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:39,740
Really? This fucking dweeb is going to shoot me? I don't think so, Larry. I just like tased

5
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:50,140
that guy. That guy got hit with a taser. That wasn't a bullet. Watch out for the actors.

6
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:58,219
Get away from the actors that run by from stage left. See you later. I died at that...

7
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:10,500
What the what? Are you serious? I shot that guy like so many times? Why is that lady smiling?

8
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,000
Why would you ever be smiling in that situation? That's not like a fun situation to be in.

9
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,640
There's two guys about to have a duel with a pistol and this lady is like smiling as

10
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:51,069
if she's in a wedding photo. This guy's shit faced so he'll be easy. That sucked! I'm planning

11
00:01:51,069 --> 00:02:06,530
on it. Did he just not even shoot the gun? Is it in the book? It's in the book! I knew

12
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:26,419
it was in the book! I knew it was in the fucking book and now I lost and it's over.

13
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:36,490
Top quality acting job, lady. Which one is it? Is it one of the guys playing cards? That

14
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,550
was a giant cartoon bag of money. Seriously, she ran out of there with a Scrooge McDuck

15
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,469
bag. You're not going to fool me. What about this guy? That guy had no idea what the fuck

16
00:02:48,590 --> 00:03:05,259
was going on. That guy missed. That guy shot the ground. That guy shot directly into the

17
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:15,840
dirt. Why is that guy a quick draw fast McGraw? That doesn't make any sense. I have no idea

18
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:32,340
what this guy just said. She's going to be quick. Oh, not quick enough. You see that

19
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:40,639
mattress behind her? That's like a stunt mattress. I'm glad you fell on that stunt

20
00:03:40,639 --> 00:04:04,419
mattress inside of a saloon. You can't tell somebody to holster the gun and then shoot.

21
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,500
She just told me to holster. Come on now. Holster that gun. I thought we were going

22
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:30,959
to play fair and no, of course not. You mean business. You can't be serious right now.

23
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,399
I was too busy paying attention to his dancing. I knew it was going to happen. I just had

24
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:44,939
to watch him dance. That was... Oh my God. This is so hard. Cause like the Wiimote, like

25
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:50,139
when you bring the Wiimote up, it's like, how am I ever supposed to do this with my

26
00:04:50,139 --> 00:05:16,759
like shaky ass hands? Here we go. I lose. I'm done. It's just too hard. I've already

27
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,879
killed this guy, but you know what? We're going to cheat. I'm just going to shoot the

28
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,800
guy right now.
