00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:20,440
Hi guys, welcome back. It's me, Jeremy. It's hair in my mouth. I just took a big almost sip of my,

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,160
I took an almost big sip of my coffee with just three or four hairs on the top of my tongue.

3
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:36,250
Good afternoon. Starting about an hour or two early today again. For the sake of Sekiro. I'm

4
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,219
going to continue. If you just got a notification and you just came over here and oh my, wait,

5
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,420
Jeremy streaming right now. I sure am. I sure am. It's Sekiro though. So you might, oh fuck,

6
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:54,179
get me out of here. You don't want to be spoiled. We are about eight hours into the game. Just want

7
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,500
to make sure you're aware of that. So I don't press the button here and switch over and you go,

8
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:14,310
I just saw a huge spoiler. We are also going to go into sub only again for today.

9
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,799
We did it with Dark Souls three and I think it just, it's just warranted for a game like this.

10
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:37,459
It keeps the spoilers and the potential spam of said spoilers at bay. I don't do it that often,

11
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:50,890
but like I said, for games like this, it's something that I do. Sub only greedy streamer.

12
00:01:52,010 --> 00:02:01,060
The greed is taking him over. He's going to force us to pay money to speak. What's next?

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,240
I want to watch you so bad, but I want to start playing. Well, the beauty of

14
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:22,870
where you are right now is this is recorded. So if you really don't want to watch me play,

15
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:29,110
you're really torn. You could play and then you could just see how I do, you know, or vice versa.

16
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,560
You know, there's no obligation to watch, but remember this is forever on the internet.

17
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,000
Everything that I'm doing right now, no matter what, everything I'm saying

18
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,840
is recorded forever. That's why I got to be careful. You know, I got to make sure I stay

19
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,360
completely sane. I don't do anything weird. Don't say anything weird.

20
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,360
Cause that was permanently the sentence I'm saying right now, permanently recorded.

21
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:00,860
There's no going back into leading this. It's already here. Every single sec and

22
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:15,750
forever recorded everything here. So I got to be ready. No pressure.

23
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:24,300
I actually am still sick too. Just it's been annoying. I'll be all right though.

24
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,780
I went to eight hours yesterday. We'll see how we do today. With that being said, I think we can

25
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,419
get off of the starting soon screen. I'm just sitting here in the inventory and let's get that

26
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:46,360
audio on too. I really want to watch the stream, but I don't want the game to be spoiled. No,

27
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,939
I can, I completely understand that. Well, hey, what you could do is here. I have a solution.

28
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:02,569
You ready? Here's the solution. Go down to the quality settings that are on the bottom of your

29
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:10,090
window here. Click on the little cog wheel, make it like three 60 P or like one 60 P

30
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:20,600
cell phone quality, turn the screen brightness down on your monitor to about 10%. Once that's done,

31
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:29,420
have a system, make a script on your computer that auto mutes the audio coming from the stream

32
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:38,389
every 10 seconds and it stays muted for 15 seconds. So you'll get snippets of me talking.

33
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,829
You won't spoil anything. Cause like, what the hell could I be talking about? Have the audio just

34
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:49,990
randomly cut off every 10 seconds for like, like 30 seconds. And at the same time, uh, be working

35
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,589
on something, have like your other monitor or have like another device in your hand, like playing a

36
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:57,290
game monitor or something. So you're not really paying that much attention. That's how you can do

37
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:06,220
it. Or just play it on your own time and enjoy it because it's meant to be enjoyed.

38
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:15,269
And speaking of things that are meant to be done, also write a script to donate big bits.

39
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,189
You have a script like on your computer, it's an exe file. You double click it

40
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:28,490
and every like 20 minutes, like a thousand dollars is given. Don't do that. That's,

41
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,629
that is absolutely the complete reverse. I know. And I had to say a thousand too, right?

42
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,899
I couldn't have said one. Speaking of one dollar, uh, those of you that weren't here yesterday,

43
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:46,519
this is actually pretty funny. Somebody, um, I think it was Tingy. They brought this up to

44
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,660
Tingy if you're here. They were saying that every time I die in Sekiro, cause I made like a, I don't

45
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,389
know, late last night, I kind of went out of my fucking mind. I went insane that one of the bosses

46
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:04,009
had lost control of all of my bodily functions, including my motor speech, uh, vehicle. So what

47
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:11,459
we decided to be funny is every time I die in Sekiro, tally it up. And at the end of the whole

48
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:19,860
thing, whenever I stopped playing it, I got to buy scratch ticket for every death or every five

49
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,939
deaths is one is like, you know, like $5 scratch ticket and just scratch them on stream. And then

50
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:31,189
whatever happens, whatever money comes from those scratch tickets goes back into the channel for

51
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:46,339
community subs. So if I hit like 500 bucks on scratch ticket, $500 worth of community subs,

52
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:54,500
watch you win $20,000. Now that would be fucking hilarious because what is $20,000?

53
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,540
I would, there'd be almost every single person, every single person on the channel would have a

54
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:08,279
sub, right? That would be too many. I would, could I legally even do that though? I might get in

55
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:15,779
trouble. If I do like 20 grand worth of community subs, some, someone's going to take a look at that

56
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:25,300
and be like, uh, what's going on here? Anyways, I'm going to consume this memory to get some more

57
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,019
attack power. This is the butterfly. This is the last, the boss that I just beat before moving on.

58
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,889
What are you in for? Too many community subs. All right. So the battle memory of an extraordinary

59
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,970
foe, although distant recollection of such a memory provided sustenance for the wolf.

60
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:51,060
The Phantom Lady Butterfly was appointed by the wolf's foster father as one of his mentors in

61
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,100
Shinobi techniques. These mentors employed strict methods. The cultivation of Shinobi techniques can

62
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,649
only be achieved in the midst of battle. Attack power has been enhanced. So I have attack power

63
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:09,139
three. I'm almost have another skill point, which I'm looking forward to because that means I get

64
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:18,199
more, hold on a second. Let me see. I was going down this path, but I don't, I, I want this.

65
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:29,420
This makes the heal better. Cough cough slash last sounds like a league of legends pro username.

66
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,200
Well, somebody get it. Somebody get it. Then win a tournament and give me 2%.

67
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:44,809
That's all I ask. Not even, no, 1%. That's all I ask. All right. So Emma taught this technique

68
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:50,220
to the sculptor long ago. So it just increased the healing effects of recovery items. I just like,

69
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:58,860
I need that. I want it. I'm going to get it. So we were, the last thing we did, we cleared the

70
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,940
chamber and that brought us out. I think this is where I was before the castle gate, right?

71
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:12,419
Friday and you can't stick around for tonight's stream, but I wanted to drop in and show some

72
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,750
support anyhow. Have a great night, Frodi and thank you for dropping in and you also get 10

73
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:24,659
bucks too. Have an awesome night. Thanks for sticking around. Well, thanks for hanging out

74
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:34,740
for the few minutes that you were here. You just made me sub. God damn it. I'm sorry. I don't do

75
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:45,769
sub only. It's only sometimes. It's for Sekiro shadows die twice. Seems a little loud to me.

76
00:09:45,769 --> 00:10:04,299
Is it a little loud to anybody else? It's because of the spoilers. So where were we? Uh, this way.

77
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:17,289
Uh, let me, I want to look at something first though, because who are these people? The man

78
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:25,980
who coughs has witnessed endless battling. Get my mouse off the screen. The sculptor is coughing.

79
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,259
The maid is coughing. The fine son, the coughing the reason he sounds of a man thinking only of

80
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:39,190
his sick mother. The man who coughs has witnessed endless battles, making offerings to the dead in

81
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:49,000
the battlefield outside Ashina castle gate. So there's that guy and his mother and the son,

82
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,690
right? That's going to remember where these people are because I don't think I can kill them.

83
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:05,059
Well, that's too low. I'm going to turn it back up. Sub mode is emote only mode with words.

84
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,450
Well, that's just chatting.

85
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:24,730
What? All right. Let's see here. Anybody else? Oh God. I don't know how I pulled that off.

86
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,419
Oh shit. Give it back up here. This is not a place I want to be right now.

87
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:54,759
Okay. Um, let's see. Where are those dogs? I gotta get the dogs first. Dog. Shit. No, I want the dog.

88
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:05,210
Oh no, this is the mushroom people are here too. I'm not gonna aggro the whole city.

89
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:16,870
Oh fuck. I gotta get out of here. Run away. One at a time. Please. I think I'm gonna die.

90
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,730
Everyone's fighting me here. Something I learned from playing last night and yesterday,

91
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:32,100
not every fight can be won. Sometimes you just got to run the hell away. You don't have to fight

92
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:42,330
five people at the same time. See if I can pick off the guy that was here. It's two dogs, right?

93
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:57,220
Was it three dogs? That's a coward's motto. That's not a coward's motto. That is a strategist's motto.

94
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:11,639
There he is. Okay. There's another dog. Let's just kill this guy. All right. How are you?

95
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:25,850
That's a very cowardly strategist. Well, isn't the goal to live? If the goal is living, isn't

96
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,879
that correct? If you were that skilled, would you really want to just be able to die that easily?

97
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:39,269
No one's Superman. Superman isn't real. In real life, you can't fight more than one person at

98
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:46,220
the same time. Somebody's gonna come from behind you with a chair and hit you in the back of the

99
00:13:46,220 --> 00:14:01,850
head. It's not gonna happen. This guy's real. Oh great. All right. Fuck the guy with the gun.

100
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:25,399
Come here. Oh, perfect parries. Oh, absolutely perfect parries. Spoilers for real life. Yeah,

101
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:34,580
you can say that. Wait, there's something over here. Let me see. Oh, a ledge. Is this the guy

102
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:45,299
that got good at Sekiro? I told you I had to just fucking save my game. I didn't get to the guys.

103
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:54,710
I didn't get to the level up screen. I dumped a bunch of experience points into my talent pool

104
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,960
and I didn't put the points in. I put them in. I fell asleep. I woke up with those skills.

105
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:11,450
Is this the guy who beat Sekiro? Shadows die twice on stream? Well, only once.

106
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:33,980
Wait, I'm gonna die if I do that. The best part about being sick is you get to do the wicked

107
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:48,330
old man laugh whenever you want. I hope somebody clips that. I guess I can drop down from this way

108
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,590
rather than... Well, let's just kill this guy in one hit. Who else is down here? This is important.

109
00:15:53,590 --> 00:16:08,279
I think I can get him and get out. Let's get in, get out. That's how you get in and get out.

110
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:17,990
Any questions? What? Why did I just do that? Oh, I can take him. I can take him. It's just two.

111
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:32,470
What are we gonna do? I've never fought a big guy like this before.

112
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:53,620
Dodging. Wow, you have fucking lots of... I forget there's no stamina. Oh, fuck.

113
00:16:54,179 --> 00:17:14,700
Yeah, they can just keep swinging. All right, where are we at? Let me go down here.

114
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:21,460
Well, let me just go down here. Can you deflect blunt objects? I think you can deflect anything,

115
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:32,420
but dodging... When I have a chance to just dodge, I'm gonna take the chance. Just because I'm so

116
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:39,619
much more used to that. Let's go this way. Anything else in here? Around the corner?

117
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:48,950
I could have hit over here. No? All right, well, let's go. Only seems to be one way to go.

118
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:57,049
Wait, what about down here? That's death. What about behind the building?

119
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:10,380
Aha! Clay. A Boston baked beans a thing. Yeah, I think I can actually upgrade one of my tools

120
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,299
now, but I don't know if I want to. Yeah, parrying is so much better now. You have to.

121
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,740
You can't not parry. It's impossible. That the whole game is based around you doing that.

122
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,869
Dodging. If those of you that didn't, weren't here yesterday, that had no idea how the game

123
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:38,740
plays. Well, first of all, that's five community subs from Kaiser, from Durnure... Thank you,

124
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:50,900
Kaiser. Okay, my name is... Not my name, your name. It doesn't discriminate between friend or foe.

125
00:18:51,700 --> 00:19:07,109
Wait, say that one more time. All right, so wait, I'm assuming this is a boss or a mini-boss that

126
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:14,539
I can have fight a person, right? But, thank you for the community subs, and to keep that kind of

127
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:20,619
question going. Yes, this game... I'm one of those people that wasn't very good at parrying

128
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:29,430
in any of the Dark Souls games. I relied on dodging and iframes, and it's all I did.

129
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:38,619
Sometimes I would parry regular enemies or Black Knights. You cannot do that anymore. There is no

130
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:44,839
dodge every attack. You have to learn how to play this game, and it can be immensely fra... I think

131
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:47,720
that's one of the reasons why everybody's saying this is the hardest one they've ever made.

132
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,400
It's not the hardest game they've ever made, it's the fact that you have to use all the tools they

133
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:00,970
give you, when before you didn't have to. That's the problem. No one's used to doing this. You

134
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:09,500
gotta like learn how to play this game, not just rely on iframes. And it can be immensely frustrating.

135
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:24,460
But, it's... Oh yeah! What? Wait, wait, where the fuck is this coming from? What the fuck is that

136
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:39,559
thing? Did somebody's dog just get out? What the fuck? Okay, um, let's take it...

137
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:49,670
It's just talking to... Speaking of dodging and parrying, let's see if we can do it.

138
00:20:50,710 --> 00:21:02,680
No, I ain't gonna. There's no verticality here either. No, are we really gonna use that thing?

139
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:24,890
You mean this? Yeah. All right, hold on. How do you parry a gigantic pig? I feel like I had health.

140
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:43,480
I'm running around. There's no stamina. Oh boy, I'm dead. Okay, um, let's just die.

141
00:21:50,339 --> 00:22:01,539
Use the... I used it all, I don't have any left. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

142
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:15,880
yeah. I haven't even used this. Should I get the, let's see, dowsing powder? Burn resistance and

143
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:23,140
resistance to burn damage. I'll put that on. How does this work? It costs two to use. Okay,

144
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,700
explosive flash that briefly blinds foes and inflicts partial damage on beast-type enemies.

145
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:39,380
It's got a wide, frontward field of effect. Scaring beasts. Oh, sick. Do something funny?

146
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,700
You got it. Hello, my baby. Hello, my darling. Hello, my ragtime gal. Send me a kiss by mile.

147
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,539
Baby, my heart's on fire. If you refuse me, baby, you lose me and you'll be left alone. And tell me,

148
00:22:51,539 --> 00:23:13,769
tell me that I'm the one and all. Happy? Can we move on? That sounds good. So, what's the point

149
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:21,539
of fighting these guys? Just go over to the giant animal. Oh, you asshole. Now I have to reset it.

150
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:37,529
Do something funny. You see, for you keen viewers, that wasn't funny. You know,

151
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:45,609
he looks like an idiot. It's not me that looks like the idiot. He looks like the idiot, right?

152
00:23:46,650 --> 00:24:08,250
I gotta utilize this laugh while I have it. I have skill. Oh, you show me that face. Here we go.

153
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:18,009
Let's get it. My heal is better. It can be even better. I'm not gonna save up for that, though.

154
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:27,849
Don't show me that face. I don't want to see that face. Let's see how this works. Let's see the

155
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:40,900
range on this. Okay, it's pretty much right in front of you. It's not that far. Can I put it,

156
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:56,059
like, on his ass? Or do I have to just have to be right in the face? That... Not this time.

157
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,809
So yeah, it doesn't understand friend or foe. So then let's just aggro the whole camp

158
00:25:12,329 --> 00:25:22,390
and have him kill everybody. What's the harm? This is gonna be a mess. This could turn into

159
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:33,769
a real mess. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Okay, so here we go.

160
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:45,130
Let's bring the whole... Bring everybody. Oh, god damn it. Oh my god.

161
00:25:49,289 --> 00:26:13,750
Well, that worked out. Scare him. Okay, that's pretty effective. Oh, he's immune to it now.

162
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:27,609
I can only do that once, it seems. No, you can... Okay, it's only kind of a weird cooldown.

163
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:50,170
Oh, this area is not that big to be diving around in. Just whittle him down. Ow! Would that hit me?

164
00:26:50,170 --> 00:27:07,299
Come on. Jesus! Oh! That was... That camera was fucking stupid. Did you see that camera?

165
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:19,079
Who's cam... What? Forget it. Fuck the camera. Fuck the camera? Why would I have it on? Shit.

166
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:51,660
I gotta move. He's almost down to half. Um, not bad. Uh, let's just try and give it an attempt here.

167
00:27:53,799 --> 00:28:02,059
Fuck. He's got a... He's got a little, like, half delay on his, uh, dash. I like that. I'm fucked.

168
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:31,579
That was decent. This run back is kind of a pain, though. Uh, I wonder. Now we'll keep this the way

169
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:51,670
it is. Hello. Goodbye. How's the game so far? I think it's great. I love it. I have, like, one or

170
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:57,589
two very slight minor issues with the game, but I don't even know if I would class by them as a

171
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:05,160
real issue. All right, let me go... The problem was last time I just got fucking screwed. All right,

172
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:32,279
stay back. This guy's gonna die. All right. Oh my god! The start of it every time. Can I jump him?

173
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:43,420
Oh, this motherfucker can't get jumped. I just have to, like, oh, lay him. All right, now I'm

174
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,299
just getting overzealous. All right, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

175
00:29:46,299 --> 00:30:14,970
Everything's fine. You can jump over him. Come on in. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Nothing

176
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:26,650
too crazy. Wait for him to come in. Boys and girls, that's what we call, um, D-O-G-S-H-I-T.

177
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:53,589
That was dog shit. I, like, didn't. You can, like, clip on his head and not jump over him when he

178
00:30:53,589 --> 00:31:05,079
charges. Of course you can. That just threw me off. I should have jumped over him that time. Not the

179
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:17,019
time you just saw, but of course. They always gotta put that guy. They gotta put this one guy

180
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:21,019
with the gun that will accidentally, he's gonna shoot me once and I'm gonna have to redo the whole

181
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:35,099
thing and run back. I beat this boss on first try, so haha. I hope you did. I bet you didn't though.

182
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:49,849
No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. All right, watch out. Oh no. I wonder

183
00:31:49,849 --> 00:32:06,440
what dog is gonna win this. How did a dog get in here? Oh, I have a bigger dog. No, that's not a

184
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:32,980
good idea. I'm just gonna dodge. That's not reliable at all. It really isn't. I really should be trying

185
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:54,680
just to run around him. Don't let him get in front of you. Do the chase. I didn't get the frame there.

186
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:29,339
Oh, don't do that to me, man. That little spin. All right, come here. Nooo.

187
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:54,140
Shit, wrong button. You can only do this one more time. That was just bad timing. Let's use it now.

188
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:34,230
Mm-hmm. Come on. Oh, come on. I really enjoy your Katamari cosplay, but come on, dude. Let me up.

189
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:54,329
He's like wicked aggressive right now. Oh yeah. Where am I going? He's got new move. He's got a

190
00:34:54,329 --> 00:35:08,219
new move. I don't even. What a fantastic camera. I got him. I got him. I got him. I'm dead. Oh my

191
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:20,949
fucking god. I just love having a camera just be like somebody was filming something else.

192
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:37,699
The only way that would have been. You would have made that worse. It happened. It happened,

193
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:47,369
by the way. Look, it happened. It happens. Now I have to start over. Yeah, the only way that

194
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:50,889
Nakata would have been worse right there with the camera was if it was a vertical fucking video.

195
00:35:50,889 --> 00:36:22,019
Come on. Boom. Almost got him. Don't worry. I'll try again in like five minutes. Dude, okay. From

196
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:25,860
software. I've got an idea for you. I have a really good. Here's an idea for a next video game that

197
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:31,139
you make. All right. Let me coat my weapon in like, let me eat. Okay. You have candy in this game.

198
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:36,260
Let me take a bite of a candy. It lasts five seconds. No, not even the next enemy you kill is

199
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:42,550
permanently dead. I would use it right there and kill that guy. You haven't figured the game.

200
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,829
They haven't come on. They haven't thought of that. The next enemy that you kill with your

201
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:56,119
blade is permanently dead. That doesn't respond. No, that would sell millions. I want to try

202
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:04,119
something. This is, this is like the, the, the idiot run. Ready? That's not going to happen.

203
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:22,889
How much is this? What does this do for my posture? I didn't even try it yet.

204
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:31,659
It actually hurts me a lot. Yeah, that's not a good idea. That's a horrible idea.

205
00:37:32,219 --> 00:38:02,119
That's not going to work. Got him in the head. The head is where he, I need to hit him. Yeah, yeah. I

206
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:18,119
know. I know. This was the idiot run for a reason. I want to see how much damage it takes to hit him

207
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:28,980
in the head before he staggers. It makes it even worse because the thing on his head just is such

208
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:38,409
a distraction for where he's moving. What is it? How many hits does it take? I can't even tell.

209
00:38:38,969 --> 00:39:06,550
Upgrade your vitality. I already did. Tried deflecting. Why the fuck does this have to be

210
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:16,889
here? Like it's only purpose is to be annoying. This could be empty. Put a tree here. Just put

211
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:25,429
a fucking bush here and it's the same purpose. The same thing. Just put a fucking statue right here.

212
00:39:25,670 --> 00:40:23,429
It worked. My potion works. I had it that time too. I'm just, you know, this happens when you

213
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:32,230
fucking shake. This is why you're not allowed to shake pinball machines because now the fucking

214
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:44,380
machine doesn't work. The pinwheel machine. All right, here we go. I'm going to try a couple of

215
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:55,820
things here. That's, yes, game. That's the guy I wanted to lock onto. The one dickhead that's still

216
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:02,300
here. Yes, that's the person I wanted to lock onto. Prioritize the fucking bald guy game. Yeah,

217
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:32,869
do that. Give me a break. I don't have the thing. I was going to try it. Why do I have the flame

218
00:41:32,869 --> 00:42:09,980
thing on? I was going to throw a hit. I was going to hit with the axe. This fucking camera. Come on,

219
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:16,280
man. Like what the fuck? You got to like, I have to just untarget him. The thing just spins around

220
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:35,130
in a fucking circle. What is it? How did this guy get in here? I don't think I have any more

221
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:50,489
hit now. I'm dead. Not yet. No, I got nothing. Well, I'm going to try it. It's possible.

222
00:42:51,369 --> 00:43:12,730
No, no, it's not. This guy's arguably harder than the last person. Last person at least had

223
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:24,260
even remote. Don't you dare. The butterfly lady. I mean, at least you had a second. This is just a

224
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:36,789
bull screaming and running in circles. You're the one that gets things down around here. No,

225
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:42,760
I'm not going to use that right now. This is very beatable. It's just, did that dog drop on my back?

226
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:51,579
All right, lock it quick before anybody gets in. Shit, somebody got in.

227
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,659
What? Oh, I didn't even have, just restarted. Geez, you die in fucking one hit too. You die

228
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:26,199
in like one or two hits in this game. You can't take any hits. You can't get hit in Sekiro. You

229
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:43,769
can't take damage. Fuck. Fuck. This is the one. I don't know. Yeah, I got, like the perfect world

230
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:50,420
has to really happen here. Don't aggro in three bald guys that accidentally hit you with a sword

231
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:57,880
that throws off the whole attempt. And perfect dodging. There's a lot of things that have to go

232
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:14,940
right here. Yeah, see? And that's what I'm talking about. It happened. If I didn't turn around, that

233
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:26,219
would have been, I would have screamed. Kill these guys, please. You actually hit me with a, oh my

234
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:49,400
fucking god. Why? Why can those guys even come in that fucking room? Kill them before they come in.

235
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:32,019
Just kill everybody before attempting a boss. I don't know if I want to do that. All right,

236
00:46:32,019 --> 00:47:26,489
put it up. Fuck. I thought he was going to do a move. The thing about trying to deflect

237
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:30,889
all of his moves is you still have to hit him. And by the time that you are done deflecting,

238
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:34,090
it's time that he's going to, you're dead. He's going to swing at you again. It's like hard to

239
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:54,869
get a word in edgewise. I think I'm still taking damage too. Anybody catch that? I didn't. I'm

240
00:47:54,869 --> 00:48:20,059
already dead. Well, I'm going to try it a couple times by parrying. It's like, you know what it's

241
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:24,860
going to have to be? It's going to be parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, and then get the attacks by

242
00:48:25,820 --> 00:49:03,940
using the skill that I have. That's a bad idea. I should have parried. What? What? That made the,

243
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:25,099
I made the blocking parry sound. Chip damage? Yeah. I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm just going

244
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:33,719
to try to play as hyper safe as I can because trying to dodge around him too is just, he moves

245
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:42,010
around so much that even the camera, the camera just can't keep up with it. So we're going to

246
00:49:42,010 --> 00:50:16,170
attempt a, oh this is a free kill. All right. I also have that move too. Let me try this.

247
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:28,539
This one. I wonder if it's worth stunning him and doing that behind him. Maybe. How did that not

248
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:51,530
block? I'm sitting there holding it. I don't know. That's not worth doing. That's probably not worth

249
00:50:51,610 --> 00:51:33,460
doing. It's so hard. It's going to make me fucking scream. Oh, that was a mistake. Chip damage. I'm

250
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:41,929
dead. Is this the only spot I can, I think I have, this is the wall. I have to beat this.

251
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,820
Or I, I don't think there's anywhere else I can go. I just have to beat it. I have to win.

252
00:51:48,539 --> 00:52:31,739
I don't have any pellets left either. No, what? No, I just did it right in his face. What the

253
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:48,889
fuck? Come on. What? That was, that wasn't part of the cool down. That was like,

254
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:56,179
hold on. Let me reset because the statue that shoots the gun just shot me. Hold on guys.

255
00:52:56,739 --> 00:53:35,369
I had it that time too, unfortunately. Just fucking man. I'm just going to run at him.

256
00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:38,809
I'm just going at him. Aggressive. I'm going to be more aggressive than he is.

257
00:54:07,210 --> 00:55:35,880
Fuck. Wrong button. Yeah. Fuck the defense dog shit. Go at him. Let's go. Stop talking. No!

258
00:55:36,760 --> 00:56:44,260
Get the camera. Come here. Oh my God. I didn't jump it. How? I don't believe it.

259
00:56:44,980 --> 00:57:16,420
I refuse to believe it. I'll get him right here. Here we go. Yeah.

260
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:34,570
I'm getting stupid. Fucking getting stupid. I don't like it. I don't like this fucking game.

261
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:50,860
It's too hard. It's too hard. It's too hard. It's too hard. It's too hard. Hey, I beat it.

262
00:57:50,860 --> 00:58:14,980
All right. So that healing effective. Okay. Cool. Huh? That was fucking intense though.

263
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:23,000
If here's the thing, I know this isn't Dark Souls and I know it's like you got to play

264
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,760
it completely differently, but sometimes you don't. Sometimes you have to just play like you play in

265
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,250
a Bloodborne boss. That's what I did differently that one time right here is just fuck it up.

266
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:36,090
Forget about like just go after him. Dodge. Go after him. Go, go, go, go, go.

267
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:46,300
Where is the bull though? For real. The more you stand there and like,

268
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:56,280
oh wait, what's moves you going to do next? Oh, watch out. Nothing in here.

269
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:04,179
I hope there's a place for me to hide. He got disenchanted.

270
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:39,820
All right. Let me just wait. I have, I wish there was a forward. This was an up, right bumper,

271
00:59:41,429 --> 01:00:07,960
kick down into the boo. I'll take it. Let me get that item. Well, let's take a look down here.

272
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:18,650
Cool. More people that way. Let's check. I want to make it the item first.

273
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:33,909
It's going to hurt. All right. Where's the item? Isn't there an item down here?

274
01:00:33,909 --> 01:01:07,130
Where's the other side? What? Item? All right. That was weird. Oh, it's right here.

275
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:19,960
Is it, it's just, oh, oh, it's just extra spirit emblems. Well, I'm down here. Might as well be

276
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:46,010
down here. What? What? Okay. Well, I need to get back up here. Yeah. No secret walls. How do I get,

277
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:53,690
is there a spot I can jump to? Or do I have to just live out the rest of my days down here?

278
01:01:53,690 --> 01:02:07,130
There we go. There's a fucking wallpaper for you right there. No, no, no. Right, right, right. I'll

279
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:19,059
tell you when. I'll tell you when. Ready? Now. No. Now. Now. Hope you got a good screenshot there.

280
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:31,340
And then just like smear out the shit on the bottom left and right.

281
01:02:31,340 --> 01:03:05,480
Gate is firmly sealed shut. Well, that's not good. Oh, look, a memory. No, I will. Why'd you link

282
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:24,969
the slap? Why, of all things. All right. Let's go this way. That's by far the most embarrassing

283
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:38,389
thing I've done on Twitch. There's a lot of layers as to why that is. I could go straight

284
01:03:38,389 --> 01:03:44,460
up the stairs, but there's a lot of people there. Does this open? Oh, this also opens.

285
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:52,869
Worse than dinosaur on green screen? Yeah, way worse. Because the dinosaur on green screen was

286
01:03:52,869 --> 01:04:05,940
intentional. Ooh, iron. I need to go take a look at what I can do with these. Fuck, man. So much

287
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:32,420
cool shit in this game. What is down here? Pellets. I need those. And a cellar? The cellar?

288
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:41,929
It's worse if you meant to do the raptor. Yeah, but that's my own doing. I really did not mean to

289
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:54,150
hit myself in the face hard. That's another form of embarrassment. Intentional, whoops, that was not

290
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:57,989
like I shouldn't have done that. I thought that was going to be different. It's a lot different

291
01:04:57,989 --> 01:05:10,789
than I just hit myself in the face as hard as I could. But I didn't, though. Wow, that was

292
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:20,070
really hard. Intentional embarrassment is not worse. No, because I knew what I was getting into.

293
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:27,739
When I put on the dinosaur ski mask, I knew what I was getting into. I had a moment off screen.

294
01:05:27,739 --> 01:05:32,380
I was stage right. I had the gloves on, and I had the mask on, and I'm like, I'm about to do this.

295
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:59,030
Here I go. Go this way. Ashina Reservoir? Did we find the branch that goes this way?

296
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:13,610
We're just going to go this way. Wow, that was almost death. Would I ever put the raptor on

297
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:23,940
again? No, I don't think so. Wait, no, this is the beginning of the game. We went all the way

298
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:30,809
around a circle here. This is the very beginning of the game because I didn't have the grapple

299
01:06:30,809 --> 01:06:40,579
hook before. Oh, okay. Interesting. So does that mean that can I now go somewhere in the beginning

300
01:06:40,579 --> 01:07:01,880
that I couldn't go before because of the grapple hook? Oh, would you look at that? Oh, that's cool.

301
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:28,659
I don't have the axe on. It doesn't really help me here. I got to get some parries

302
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:40,519
because no way I'm going to take that hat off without them. Come on, take it off. Get your

303
01:07:40,519 --> 01:08:00,519
fucking hat off. Take that. Finally. Okay, look at that R1 spam. Heavy coin purse and scrap iron.

304
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:16,220
Cool. So it was really worth coming up here, wasn't it? Yeah. Oh boy. And I'm poisoned. Poison's a lot

305
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:29,350
worse than this fucking game than any of the other ones. Whoa, that takes fast. How long does

306
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:52,199
it last for? Come on, man. Really? I think that's all I can do down here. It was worth coming to get

307
01:08:52,199 --> 01:09:10,779
the iron. Yeah, I don't think there's much else I can do here. Let's maybe up this way. Stinky Sekiro.

308
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:40,260
Nope, I can go over here. So this leads back up to the second area. This leads to here. So then

309
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:49,579
let's go this way. Might as well just rest here. Speedrunners are beating this game in 20 minutes.

310
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:55,539
It takes 20 minutes to run from that first zone probably to where I'm standing right now.

311
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,460
I don't believe that yet. I don't think anyone's beaten the game yet. I looked on the

312
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:08,649
steamachievements.org and zero percent completion at the moment. So I mean, nice jibate attempt.

313
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:22,680
You almost jibated me there. Speaking of trying to not die, I'm just gonna have to get it done.

314
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:44,569
You know what I mean? Like just get it done. Dogs first. Get her dead. This one time I went

315
01:10:44,569 --> 01:10:53,350
out of the store and not tell you. You guys know that that guy's not really... That's just a character

316
01:10:53,350 --> 01:11:08,970
you get that right. I thought about this for a long time. You know like grandpa? I had this

317
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:17,720
conversation with myself. Is it worth like 50 million dollars for me to have to become grandpa?

318
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:23,159
This is what I do. I'm just an old fucking guy every day and that's me.

319
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:28,300
I have to change everything. I have to just be grandpa in my conversations with people

320
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:39,130
in my everyday life, in my you know just shows. I just have to be grandpa for life. That's what

321
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:53,380
Larry the Cable Guy is doing right now. He's doing grandpa for life. I think I can jump up.

322
01:11:53,380 --> 01:12:02,489
I can get up there. Probably not in private. I'm not so sure about that though guys.

323
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:12,550
For one very important reason. If you do a voice for long enough over and over again you kind of

324
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:18,550
just like start to... How would you... It would just become your everyday life. If eight out of

325
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:22,869
24 hours in a day you're talking like grandpa you're gonna have a conversation with your

326
01:12:22,869 --> 01:12:29,609
mother like that. That's just gonna happen. And maybe it'd be like a little different like this

327
01:12:29,609 --> 01:12:35,579
or something but I talk like this all day every single second of every day. You would permanently

328
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:53,659
change your vocal cords. And by the way I'm kind of being stupid here. Can anybody see me?

329
01:12:53,659 --> 01:13:08,439
I cleared out the arches. That's good. All right. Can he see? Are these not stealth bushes? Yeah

330
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:16,199
they are. Oh shit he's coming. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Go for this one. This one. This one.

331
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:28,310
This one. Oh you have a punch. You punch too do you? Oh shit. Okay. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

332
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:40,359
Cut it out. Nah. It's always the slow ones that cause me so many problems. Every time.

333
01:13:41,539 --> 01:14:23,829
No. Watch out. This is gonna jump on somebody's head here. Assholes. Don't even think about it.

334
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:40,630
Fire? Fire doesn't really do much do you? Wow. What about you? Are you guys beasts? Kind of.

335
01:14:41,829 --> 01:15:10,420
Kind of. Oh my god. This is come on. Jesus. How do I separate you two? If one's not swinging the

336
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:30,520
other one's getting ready to swing. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Where's the fuck? Why?

337
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:45,500
Where was his bottom bar? Oh my god. His bottom bar was like blank. I'm just angry now and it's

338
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:54,899
causing a problem. I'm dead. No I'm not. Fuck it. I'm not losing that shit.

339
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:26,869
By the way you just came from a boss that attacks 50 times a second and I'm here to show you.

340
01:16:26,869 --> 01:16:50,680
I'm so mad right now. He's gonna kill me. I'm just gonna run. Just open a fucking door.

341
01:16:50,680 --> 01:17:34,649
It's locked. What do we got over here? I get the last laugh. No I don't. I thought I was gonna get

342
01:17:34,649 --> 01:18:47,460
it up. Uh. Hey. Hey there. I didn't even tell him. Uh. Is that it?

343
01:18:48,260 --> 01:19:21,420
He's coughing. Coughing my face. I need to go back and bring it to the lady. He's a huge sword. Yeah

344
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:49,939
that's right. Shamisen. Okay so the shamisen is down here. What's up here? Uh well I think I just

345
01:19:49,939 --> 01:19:59,750
figured out a way to take a full bar off that guy. Okay. Not right now obviously because I have no

346
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:28,380
health. Hey I'll be back. You stay there. All right. I can go into here. Wait. This doesn't open.

347
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:40,340
That I could go. This is the tutorial zone. Remember I went in here. Where's the big guy?

348
01:20:40,340 --> 01:21:16,119
I will have my revenge. Is somebody else here? I will have my revenge. Wait till he turns around

349
01:21:16,119 --> 01:21:38,439
then I'm gonna go right behind him. He didn't hear a thing. I just Kool-Aid man. Threw this

350
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:59,500
guy's apartment window. All right. Did it. I need. What the hell do I need? What? No no no no. I need

351
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:24,760
a. I need a save point. Not a boss. Oh. How do I? He's just guarding me. This. I just smash brothers

352
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:42,340
all over again. Come on Diddy Kong. Give me a break. What do you got in here? What are you guarding

353
01:22:42,340 --> 01:23:00,970
in here? Why are you doing this? What's in here? Rule number one. Never leave your house.

354
01:23:16,869 --> 01:23:22,619
I didn't think he'd really come back in that quick. You scared the shit out of me. He's scared. No

355
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:32,520
somebody else is dying. Uh well I know where two people are. Let's see if I can get there without

356
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:45,029
causing any problems. The one dude's over there. Let's see if I can. Let's just go this way. Okay

357
01:23:45,029 --> 01:24:12,970
so up there. No not the guy with the frying pan. There wasn't anybody to alert anyway. So let's go

358
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:21,770
this way. Okay why can't I just stand up here? I can't like break this and open that door from

359
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:37,739
the other side. I probably can right? All right. I should be able to. I wonder if I can avoid the

360
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:46,729
big guys and just fight the dude up on the stairs. Oh yeah definitely. So this is the route to go.

361
01:24:48,600 --> 01:25:15,909
Somebody saw me. Although can I? Who saw me? Big guy. Question. Maybe I can I get behind him

362
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:23,770
and take off one of his bars? Maybe. Now that would be cool. I wonder. Let's go all the way around.

363
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:32,859
Absolutely. Watch this shit. I'm gonna go sneak through the house. The door. The tutorial door.

364
01:25:33,579 --> 01:25:57,340
And I'm gonna backstab him. He can have no fucking idea. Okay I don't know how that happened. Oh

365
01:25:57,340 --> 01:26:16,789
this is gonna be perfect. But there's a cutscene. Let's okay. Let's watch the cutscene. Rule number

366
01:26:16,789 --> 01:26:40,260
two. Leave your house so you don't get backstabbed. Hello. I'll take a free bar please. If you could.

367
01:26:40,260 --> 01:27:13,819
So he's gonna thrust. Thrust. What else you got? That's a sweep. Okay. Oh fuck. Fuck. I'm dead.

368
01:27:13,819 --> 01:27:28,789
Oh I should. I might be able to still kill him though. You gotta be kidding me. One hit kill.

369
01:27:28,789 --> 01:27:34,729
Why did everybody have one of these? You. I gotta get that back. I just have no idea what the fuck

370
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:42,659
he even does. It's got full baseball insta-kill. Unseen aid. Okay well I. That doesn't. Who cares.

371
01:27:46,619 --> 01:28:02,630
Prediction master. I got juggled. I'm like playing Street Fighter right now. God. Oh come on.

372
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:16,739
It's fantastic. Well so he has a thrust. He has a sweep and he also has a giant baseball swing and

373
01:28:16,739 --> 01:28:30,250
now the guy with the dinner plate now ruined the whole thing. I can beat this guy. I mean it's

374
01:28:30,329 --> 01:28:58,020
very clearly I got one tick on him already. Just gonna hang on the ledge. Just run and get another

375
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:05,260
backstab on him. I mean I don't know if that's possible. If it is, this game doesn't know what

376
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:13,739
kind of game it wants to be. If that's possible. Like are you a stealth game or are you an action

377
01:29:13,739 --> 01:29:18,420
game? Right? Because if I can backstab him, run away and then backstab him. Like what the hell is

378
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:34,840
going on here? If you run away he gets two bars again. Okay. That's. I'm glad that happens. You

379
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:54,869
shouldn't be able to do that. Otherwise you could just do that to everybody. Let's go. That's a

380
01:29:54,869 --> 01:30:12,119
sweep. Oh he digs it into the ground. He doesn't go straight forward. What? Just. Did he explode?

381
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:40,100
Oh my god. So slow.

382
01:30:45,739 --> 01:30:56,020
Unlike any game I've ever played, the absolutely just tremendous amount of focus you have to have

383
01:30:56,020 --> 01:31:07,500
in each one of these fights. It doesn't matter who it is. I forgot about the guy with the

384
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:19,399
fucking pan again. Oh god. You always have to worry about the one guy. The one guy that makes

385
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:25,930
every route annoying. They're always there. Don't forget about me. Ding ding ding. Remember me? I'm

386
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:31,399
the one that causes all the fucking problems here. It's me. I'm one person that causes every issue.

387
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:40,470
I'm the noise statue. You ran into the gun statue. Well sorry. I don't use weapons. I just smash my

388
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:45,020
plates together and make everybody come after you. Oh everybody else on the whole map. Fuck them.

389
01:31:45,020 --> 01:32:37,300
You don't. You worry about me and only me. Who saw that? Oh he saw me. All right. Here we go again.

390
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:49,430
Hi. I'm here for you to baseball one hits kill me again. Just kidding. I saw him. I'm coming to help

391
01:32:49,430 --> 01:34:05,449
you. It's a sweep not a fucking. Again. Oh it just takes up the whole fucking screen. I keep on

392
01:34:05,449 --> 01:34:18,300
trying to get it. He's got such quick. Not enough. Oh I didn't get it. He just varies up his timing

393
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:31,539
so much. It's either going to be a big baseball swing or a little. No don't go. I'm going the

394
01:34:31,539 --> 01:34:39,500
wrong way. Just rest. Bear it. It's like the rock paper scissors between sweep stab. It's you got

395
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:50,539
that tenth of a second to figure it out. Fuck. This game is brutal. I'll get him. Oh what?

396
01:34:51,260 --> 01:35:13,560
I made a fucking joke. I made a joke and he still hit it. Now I might just go reset. This game looks

397
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:34,710
amazing. It is. Oh it is. It's fucking unbelievable. It's just brutal. I fucked this whole thing up.

398
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,479
It's like punishing is the way. It really is like a fucking fighting game.

399
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:07,289
The punishment for mistakes in Sekiro is way way more aggressive than it is in any

400
01:36:07,289 --> 01:36:14,010
of the other games they've ever made. You make a mistake in Sekiro. Oh fuck you. You fuck you.

401
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:18,550
You made a mistake in like Dark Souls. You could take a few hits and you could fuck it up a couple

402
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:43,640
times. You got like 10 Estes. Sometimes 15 Estes flasks to drink. That big guy's gonna see me

403
01:36:43,640 --> 01:37:25,210
isn't he? All right here we go. Oh I couldn't really block that. Careful. Got it. He's not gonna

404
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:32,260
go off the... We're in such a stupid place right now. Come on. Why did we get over here? He's like

405
01:37:32,260 --> 01:38:01,340
just stuck over on the... I don't even know what the fuck that was. Got it. What? Come on. I didn't

406
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:32,229
jump over it. What? Oh what? I thought I clearly jumped over it. That was a big sweep right? What

407
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:40,619
are tools? I don't like don't know which one to use here. I'm just trying to get his moves down

408
01:38:40,619 --> 01:38:47,770
to fight him. I mean it's one thing to use the tools. It's another thing to like... I don't even...

409
01:38:47,770 --> 01:39:19,449
I gotta get down like how to even fight and parry him. That's not a sweep. Are you sure? It looks

410
01:39:19,449 --> 01:39:43,510
very sweep-ish. He comes like up with it. Let me see what else I got here. I have dirt, oil. I wanna go

411
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:57,670
for equipment. Fire, axe. I don't want to use that here. I'll try throwing dirt at him. Firecracker.

412
01:39:57,670 --> 01:40:21,500
I don't know if it's gonna work very well but I'll try. All right. If somebody was saying don't fight him

413
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:24,300
on the stairs. Well if I don't fight him on the stairs, if I bring him down, I have to clear the

414
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:31,510
whole area right? Because if I bring him down there, there's like two big guys, like two archers,

415
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:37,020
three... it's... I'm gonna fight him up here. I'll aggro the whole fucking town if I go down there.

416
01:40:37,659 --> 01:40:52,649
Let's see here. Eat some dirt. Okay well it's parryable but it hurts... it gives me a lot of

417
01:40:52,649 --> 01:41:29,100
bullshit. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Yeah just... eeeek. I didn't catch... no I didn't want to do that.

418
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:55,930
I didn't want to do that. No! No! I got the wrong thing equipped! It's hard to get around

419
01:41:55,930 --> 01:42:02,869
him too because I need to take his health down. I gotta dodge around him. I need to hurt him.

420
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:25,800
I have no fucking idea what he was doing there. Fuck. It's hard to tell with that what he's gonna

421
01:42:25,800 --> 01:43:17,750
even do. My goodness gracious. He does so much posture damage even if you deflect him. No I forgot

422
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:28,060
again about the one guy with the fucking pan. I'm resetting it. I'm just so focused on fighting this

423
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:35,750
guy that happened to fucking... it's my one gripe with all these games. Like you're so focused on

424
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:39,909
fighting the guy that you want to fight that you just... I want to go fight that guy not like run

425
01:43:39,909 --> 01:44:42,710
through pan guy 30 times. What? Oh okay. Somebody can still see me. Use firecrackers. I'll give it a

426
01:44:42,710 --> 01:45:24,300
try. Hello? That guy went all the way around. Yeah imagine not backstabbing this guy. God it would be

427
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:52,010
hell. I don't want to... that shit takes too much posture. I was gonna get away from it.

428
01:45:52,729 --> 01:46:07,159
Nope there it is. He doesn't do it that often. Do you see how much recovery that like... okay so I did

429
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:13,510
I did the the fucking... I stepped on it for the stat slash and then he immediately does another

430
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:29,909
move that I'm still stuck on animation. Like I'm in the animation right now still. See? When you

431
01:46:29,909 --> 01:46:55,369
step on it you have to parry. Yeah but he like pulls it out. To the right instead. Let me see.

432
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:08,760
A class... whatever just bring back to the fucking idol. Classic case of get good. Yeah you know

433
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:15,029
that's absolutely certain because you literally cannot play this game. Go look up like threads

434
01:47:15,029 --> 01:47:19,029
about people talking about this game. People are like giving up on the game because they can't do

435
01:47:19,029 --> 01:47:30,010
it. If you don't get good at Sekiro you don't get to play. That's pretty much how it goes. So where

436
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:51,590
am I? What am I doing? No how can I reach it from there but not reach it from here? So what you're

437
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:59,420
saying like from this direction you mean? Let me just take a look. Let me just look at it. I've got

438
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:05,909
to deal with these guys but I'm gonna just see what you mean. Like up on the roof? Like over this way?

439
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:28,899
So if I go from roof to here. Well and then to here. Oh all right. Yeah but don't he sees you

440
01:48:28,899 --> 01:48:40,250
here though? Does he not see you? I guess he just doesn't see you if you do that. That's weird

441
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:49,140
considering how good he is at everything else. I got I pulled everybody though. How did you not

442
01:48:49,140 --> 01:49:03,619
know this guy's coming over here to fight me? Does he know? He still doesn't know. He's just

443
01:49:03,619 --> 01:49:07,529
pretending. He's gonna turn and baseball swing me and I'm gonna die. And then I'm gonna go on like

444
01:49:07,529 --> 01:49:27,670
the Reddit and be like guys I don't know if I can do this. It's fucking insane. I'm so much in trouble.

445
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:49,640
I'm in trouble. Good I distracted him. I'm just gonna back away when he does it. I haven't figured

446
01:49:49,640 --> 01:50:07,909
out the reliable way. Fuck why? I didn't I didn't have enough. Oh it's so he strings it together so

447
01:50:07,909 --> 01:50:40,439
fast. No that's the longer one. Oh my god. This guy's worse than the other bosses in the game.

448
01:50:42,039 --> 01:50:57,659
Oh worse than the ball? Maybe. The ball only had like one or two. The ball really only had one

449
01:50:57,659 --> 01:51:06,170
thing. Speed and psycho. Didn't really have much else. Fucking pan guy. Yes from software. I'm aware

450
01:51:06,170 --> 01:51:12,170
I gotta kill the guy with the pan every time. Why am I coming over here? Oh my god. I just wanna

451
01:51:12,170 --> 01:51:27,699
fucking play the game. Fuck it. I'm going this way. I'm about to go on Reddit. Yeah guys I'm

452
01:51:27,699 --> 01:51:34,539
having like a lot of trouble with the game. There's this pan guy. Is there a way to spike

453
01:51:34,539 --> 01:51:38,939
the pan into his skull as hard as I can and make it so that enemy never comes back?

454
01:51:39,739 --> 01:51:53,420
I actually read an article. I looked up like an article. There's an article that says is

455
01:51:53,420 --> 01:52:06,890
Sekiro the hardest game ever made? It might be. It might be. Maybe ET. ET was impossible.

456
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:27,020
Battletoads 2 was up there. You got so you guys okay so you got ET, Battletoads, and then Sekiro.

457
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:43,210
Sekiro. Lock on to him. Is there somebody? Where is that? Where are you coming from?

458
01:52:43,850 --> 01:53:17,050
Good I like a challenge. Bring it on. I gotta get off this fucking staircase.

459
01:53:32,279 --> 01:53:39,989
We're the fucking guy here. Have to fight him one on one otherwise like don't even fucking try.

460
01:53:41,029 --> 01:54:09,159
Use the dodge to step on his spear. I've done it like 30 times. I've done it. I don't know why

461
01:54:09,159 --> 01:54:24,779
left bumper wasn't working there. What the fuck man. You can listen for the clicks when I did this

462
01:54:24,779 --> 01:54:43,529
last time. And I'm going the wrong way again. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing

463
01:54:43,529 --> 01:55:03,510
game? God why are you like this? Am I playing Assassin's Creed? Is there a reason why I was

464
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:15,189
getting like fucking stuck on the ledge? What the fuck is happening right now? Come on. What? Oh my

465
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:33,380
God. Just fucking kill me. I don't even care. Just reset it please. Why did the lights turn

466
01:55:33,380 --> 01:56:28,420
off in my house? Like come here. All right let's try this again. Okay I have to kill this motherfucker.

467
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:56,779
Why? I don't know if I like coming this way. Unless can I get there from up here or something?

468
01:56:56,779 --> 01:57:27,829
Who is even looking over here? What? You came all the way from the courtyard. He's just waiting for

469
01:57:27,829 --> 01:57:36,069
him. This way is... I don't know if I want to go this way because they keep... Come on. Come

470
01:57:36,069 --> 01:58:01,479
get me. Let's go. I don't even know where that guy came from. Do that again but this way. No what?

471
01:58:01,479 --> 01:58:15,750
Come on. Fall with me. At least make it worth it for me. Enemies don't fall off platforms in this

472
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:27,029
game. I'm gonna go the route that I know. I feel when I go that way I just pull everybody

473
01:58:27,029 --> 01:59:04,149
and then they they walk this way. I just have to worry about stupid fucking pan guy. All right

474
01:59:04,149 --> 01:59:13,750
let's go. So I can go that way but will he see me? I wonder. I wonder. Let me just try this.

475
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:33,319
I don't think he saw me do that. I'm so worried about this guy turning around. This guy's so

476
01:59:33,319 --> 01:59:46,220
oblivious to everything but then again big guy's still here. Hydrate? I will. I'll be fine. I will.

477
01:59:46,220 --> 02:00:00,090
That guy in the other hand is not leaving. Okay turn around. Get out of here. All right if I don't

478
02:00:00,090 --> 02:00:11,020
beat him right here I'm gonna go get some water and fucking just pee and no I'm beating him right

479
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:41,770
now. That was so delayed. It's so fucking delayed. It's so hard to time it. I've seen if I had frames

480
02:00:41,770 --> 02:02:58,250
on it. No I'm done. Jesus Christ. I'll be right back. Going offline? What? This game is so brutal man.

481
02:02:59,050 --> 02:03:06,789
It's so fucking brutal. It hates you. Everybody makes that joke like oh Dark Souls. From Software

482
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:15,460
dang you're gonna die. You're gonna lose. You're gonna lose. Not only are you gonna lose in this game

483
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:25,909
but man From Software is gonna make sure nobody goes to your funeral. You know what I mean?

484
02:03:41,989 --> 02:04:00,550
Easy game. Oh my stream deck is fucked up. It's definitely because you're sick. No.

485
02:04:01,909 --> 02:04:09,430
Am I going to Pax East? I am not going to Pax East. Unfortunately. I live on the west coast now.

486
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:26,859
It's just something that wasn't really in the cards anymore. Hey beat the game now. Stop trying.

487
02:04:27,579 --> 02:04:42,180
I'm trying. I missed the old Sekiro streams. There's only been two. One of them is yesterday.

488
02:04:42,899 --> 02:04:46,260
I missed the old Sekiro streams. You know the one from yesterday

489
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:52,619
when he got so mad that he pretended to fall down a well in his fucking room.

490
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:09,640
Ah again. A good old days like yesterday.

491
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:10,140
Okay.

492
02:05:14,779 --> 02:05:45,909
All right. Wait for that. Can I go up the stairs? There's nothing else up here. All right. Come on.

493
02:05:45,909 --> 02:05:49,829
Just beat him. Beat this guy. This guy's giving me more trouble than anybody and he's not even a

494
02:05:49,829 --> 02:07:27,510
real boss. He's a fake boss. Wow that was weird. Hi. I just want to say I want to thank everybody

495
02:07:28,069 --> 02:07:29,590
for supporting this this whole time.

496
02:07:31,859 --> 02:07:38,699
I want to thank my mom for giving me the constant support that she has given me my entire life.

497
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:59,909
Where's the emote? How do I do the emote? How do I? How do I like physics roll this guy off the cliff

498
02:08:01,739 --> 02:08:06,920
and then do a full P stream down on his body? Oh that was so.

499
02:08:11,399 --> 02:08:19,909
Hardest game ever made I'm telling you. Now how does it feel that you are

500
02:08:20,949 --> 02:08:23,430
like the second hardest thing I've done in this game?

501
02:08:24,069 --> 02:08:30,119
First hardest thing was even turning it on. You know. Who the hell are you?

502
02:08:30,119 --> 02:08:49,770
I got overconfidence now. Let's go. I got my confidence back. What's that line?

503
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:10,869
All right. Stop fucking around. Get out of here. Get out out out out out. Going up top.

504
02:09:11,510 --> 02:09:30,600
I got four beads now. Oh but what? Restore a node of resurrected power

505
02:09:31,239 --> 02:09:44,579
to enslave a Jizo statue in his to express. Okay so I can. I'm so happy to beat that guy.

506
02:09:45,220 --> 02:09:51,050
But do you guys think this is the hardest game ever made? What do you guys think is the hardest

507
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:56,260
game ever made? And I don't know. Okay let me rephrase that. I know that there are. Okay look.

508
02:09:56,260 --> 02:10:01,140
I know that there is like modded Super Mario levels that are unbeatable. I'm talking about

509
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:06,439
like a game that was like published by like a major publisher. What do you think it is?

510
02:10:07,239 --> 02:10:28,869
The Jeweled. Ghosts and Goblins. Because I know people are going to tell me that.

511
02:10:28,869 --> 02:10:34,149
Well hold on a second Jeremy. What about like Boshi? Right? Boshi is considered one of the

512
02:10:34,149 --> 02:10:57,460
hardest video games ever. But there's no ad for Boshi. There's no TV ads for Boshi. That's a

513
02:10:57,460 --> 02:11:04,220
bullshit requirement. Now I'm saying like a major AAA published game. And what do you think it is?

514
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:09,819
Because there are a ton of indie titles that are insanely difficult. I'm talking about ones that

515
02:11:09,819 --> 02:11:23,079
are on the shelf at Walmart. I'm talking about games that you could just go and buy right now

516
02:11:23,079 --> 02:11:32,949
at GameStop. I asked that question 30 minutes ago Jeremy. Thanks for stealing my icebreaker

517
02:11:32,949 --> 02:11:48,579
conversation pieces. So Sekiro is the hardest Walmart game. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sekiro is the

518
02:11:48,579 --> 02:11:56,819
you. Sekiro is the hardest game you can buy at Walmart. Where am I supposed to go from here?

519
02:11:56,819 --> 02:12:17,220
Oh yeah there was that oh yeah wait no no no there's that other guy. Am I enjoying the game?

520
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:25,319
I love this game. It's fucking awesome. It's making me it's making me like question everything I've

521
02:12:25,319 --> 02:12:33,960
ever known in my life. It's testing me. You know it's testing me like like a true god should.

522
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:48,979
What about the Surge? Are we talking about worst games you can buy at Walmart or hardest games

523
02:12:48,979 --> 02:13:15,159
you can buy at Walmart? The hardest Walmart game. That should be a tagline. Sekiro. Yeah. Sekiro.

524
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:34,439
Be careful not to accidentally buy this. You will hate it. Sekiro. It's too hard for you grandma.

525
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:38,739
Right? That would have been like if this was on Super Nintendo that's what it would be.

526
02:13:39,460 --> 02:13:46,939
All right I need to get back up to where was that guy that was standing above the thing? He's like

527
02:13:46,939 --> 02:13:53,819
don't go down there unless you want to hear this music. I don't think that was back the other way

528
02:13:53,819 --> 02:14:15,369
wasn't it? Have I even been over here? What's the point of me coming up here? What about this way?

529
02:14:25,159 --> 02:14:36,100
No this is to come back out. Wait is this that? No. Your grandma definitely won't beat this game but

530
02:14:36,100 --> 02:14:52,949
maybe she will. I don't know. It's possible. This is uh hold on. This is okay right yeah here we are.

531
02:14:55,340 --> 02:15:02,550
I didn't go up. I didn't go straight up there. How much money do I have?

532
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:12,699
Well I have enough to do this. Loose beads. More health and more vitality. More posture.

533
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:24,600
All right well then let's let's open up the new dialogue then. What is the hardest fucking game

534
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:42,300
ever? That is like a game and not an unbeatable joke troll game. Ninja Gate. Dragon's Lair.

535
02:15:43,020 --> 02:16:01,779
Wait cough in my face. Take coughed up blood. I'm taking a blood sample. Please if you could

536
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:11,800
do it directly into my mouth. Get as much of you can in there. Okay.

537
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:29,300
What's the hardest movie to watch to get through? You think? Because if we're gonna have a video game

538
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:54,409
definition it has to be a movie and tv show definition. I got something for you.

539
02:16:58,629 --> 02:17:03,829
What's the hardest human activity? Without something that's not just like lifting weights.

540
02:17:03,829 --> 02:17:06,950
Something that's oh uh deadlift a thousand pounds. No.

541
02:17:06,950 --> 02:17:11,530
The gate to the castle however is shut. Let's see.

542
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:20,059
It's driving? It might be driving. Driving is a really difficult thing to do. It kind of just is.

543
02:17:37,399 --> 02:17:41,239
It's too easy sometimes guys. Come on. All right what do I have here?

544
02:17:45,719 --> 02:17:50,819
All right I need to do one of these. What do I got? There's only a certain amount of these tools

545
02:17:50,819 --> 02:18:20,700
though. Spring loaded firecracker. Spring loaded axe. We can go down axe tree. I kind of like the

546
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:26,979
firecrackers though. It's hard to mess up firecrackers. They're big radius. They sit

547
02:18:26,979 --> 02:18:45,180
around for a few frames. Cooldown's not great though. I'm not really good with the slow weapons.

548
02:18:45,739 --> 02:18:53,000
Would you recommend this game to someone who just wants to have a good time or like come to hate

549
02:18:53,000 --> 02:19:00,780
myself? It really depends on how you approach it because I mean you've seen right. Anytime you

550
02:19:00,780 --> 02:19:06,780
play a game like this you're gonna hit that point. It happens to everybody. It does. And saying that

551
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:12,299
it doesn't happen to you is just horseshit and I don't believe you and I would love to hook you up

552
02:19:12,299 --> 02:19:18,059
to a lie detector and have you say these words with a straight face that you don't do these things.

553
02:19:19,059 --> 02:19:25,829
But you're going to get upset at the game. It's gonna happen. You're going to be irritated by

554
02:19:25,829 --> 02:19:33,690
something. You're gonna lose over and over again like you just watched me do in real time. You're

555
02:19:33,690 --> 02:19:41,540
gonna lose like five times in a row to something and go why am I can I even do this? Am I capable

556
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:49,459
of doing this? And you probably are yeah. But if you're okay with getting through that sort of

557
02:19:49,459 --> 02:20:04,540
pushing a rock up a mountain the experience is unforgettable. All these games. It happened to me

558
02:20:04,540 --> 02:20:15,219
like 10 minutes ago yeah. It's very natural to get upset at this game. Now not to a point where you

559
02:20:15,219 --> 02:20:20,729
know obviously there's different levels of being upset because you can be like what the fuck like

560
02:20:20,729 --> 02:20:25,850
fuck this this is stupid like god I blocked that I blocked that and then like you know you obviously

561
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:31,350
don't want to get to a level where you're like smashing shit and screaming as loud as you can

562
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:36,309
and like if it's you don't want like actual like real negative energy coming into your life

563
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:42,659
because you can't beat a sakura boss. But as long as you you know you you give yourself that limit

564
02:20:42,659 --> 02:21:00,219
you can take a break. I went downstairs and I drank some orange juice. Just smash the tv. No.

565
02:21:05,459 --> 02:21:10,020
But if you can put up with your own mind getting in the way that's what happens every time I play

566
02:21:10,020 --> 02:21:13,620
these games it happens and I know it's gonna happen that's why I always like push through it

567
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:19,159
and just continue to go because no matter what I say no matter how many things I say about you know

568
02:21:19,159 --> 02:21:24,139
what I'm uh I think this is too hard I'm not sure about this this boss is I think it's impossible

569
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:29,799
no I know I can't do it I can't I know I'm gonna try again as long as you just like fight through

570
02:21:29,799 --> 02:21:37,059
that your devil on your shoulder telling you that you can't do it you'll get better and you you will

571
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:54,149
also applies to life in general there's a lot of symbolism while you play these games for

572
02:21:55,100 --> 02:22:01,610
you know getting in your own way getting out of the way trying failing succeeding that's why they

573
02:22:01,610 --> 02:22:12,409
made these games they knew what they were doing yeah but how though I really just keep dying

574
02:22:12,409 --> 02:22:17,659
uh but that's a whole nother conversation entirely though maybe the maybe the game's

575
02:22:17,659 --> 02:22:28,459
just not for you like some people love that kind of intense punishing punishing experience

576
02:22:28,459 --> 02:22:35,000
that forces you to do well otherwise you won't do it at all but you know you don't have to have it

577
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:40,709
you know you don't have to do it that's look I'm that's what I'm here for right just watch me

578
02:22:42,459 --> 02:22:54,299
scream at stuff and get upset about how bad I am at parrying something but eventually I

579
02:22:54,299 --> 02:22:58,059
I will beat it I don't know when but okay I'm trying to figure out what the hell I want to do

580
02:22:58,059 --> 02:23:09,239
here uh I wonder what you unlock down let's not do firecrackers let's do it enemies in all directions

581
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:16,360
and then this when you gave up on celeste I beat celeste I just didn't do the extra celeste

582
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:26,739
just got here when does he play the game I I just was talking about like the difficulty and somebody

583
02:23:26,739 --> 02:23:31,159
asked like how hard it is to get into these games oh I can't have like I've been playing for like

584
02:23:31,159 --> 02:23:36,040
two and a half hours I can't have like what two three minutes of just talking for a second

585
02:23:39,860 --> 02:23:45,739
over over the course of like what is going to be tonight like a 10 hour broadcast no no I don't

586
02:23:45,819 --> 02:23:49,260
how dare you spend three minutes talking about like somebody asked a question

587
02:23:49,260 --> 02:24:04,149
what the fuck now I'm gonna go down this path I want to know what that is well I don't have that

588
02:24:04,149 --> 02:24:24,809
tool but I want it spring-loaded firecracker I'm doing it long spark oh long barrel I wonder what

589
02:24:24,809 --> 02:24:35,940
this is yeah I mean this game is like really intense too so if I I just spent like almost

590
02:24:35,940 --> 02:24:42,020
an hour trying to beat that fucking samurai out in front of the uh the steps there I'm gonna take

591
02:24:42,020 --> 02:24:58,340
a second I gotta collect myself a little you know but now here's the sample obtained one

592
02:24:58,340 --> 02:25:06,059
let me see the narration is very similar to the sculptors the color is just slightly tainted but

593
02:25:06,059 --> 02:25:14,950
what's this do you have enough blood I believe so I know what BWL is I beat that game like last week

594
02:25:14,950 --> 02:25:23,540
when we speak again it's likely I'll have made a breakthrough in fact okay do I have any seeds

595
02:25:24,260 --> 02:25:34,940
BWL he doesn't know BWL he doesn't know yes I do I looked up I got a confession to make

596
02:25:36,969 --> 02:25:42,260
uh I really hate to say this but like I wanted to make sure I was prepared for the stream and

597
02:25:42,260 --> 02:25:47,770
that I'm like a streamer you know I read the Wikipedia page and I read every boss and every

598
02:25:47,770 --> 02:25:53,530
strategy and every reference and I know what whatever item is come on guys I'm streaming it

599
02:25:53,530 --> 02:25:57,209
like I have to like make sure I'm presenting it and I can like keep going I don't get lost or stuck

600
02:25:57,930 --> 02:26:08,090
I know everything I know they did this weird thing like I know the last boss is it's a giant

601
02:26:08,090 --> 02:26:17,000
it's a snake with five heads and then it transforms into a giant goat and with horns and shit I know

602
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:30,950
what it is I'm sorry I'll try better next time I'm sorry all right oh what's this stuff breath of

603
02:26:30,950 --> 02:26:40,020
nature light get that off the fucking screen a latent scale increases the damage of

604
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:45,540
increases the damage inflicted to posture upon performing a successful deflection

605
02:26:48,229 --> 02:26:57,500
so it's just more of this no that's not right recovers posture upon executing a successful

606
02:26:57,500 --> 02:27:12,340
death blow yeah um this reduces the amount of damage I want this one I'm gonna save up for this

607
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:30,340
one isn't this too much of a normie game for me to be playing this what a normie game isn't this

608
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:39,059
like the anti normie game this is not a game that from your definition of like a what a normie

609
02:27:39,700 --> 02:27:45,700
what is it what does that even mean a normal person what does that even mean

610
02:27:46,340 --> 02:28:00,100

642
02:39:10,739 --> 02:39:35,909
corner you may as well go microwave a fucking burrito that's my motto too

643
02:39:42,790 --> 02:40:26,340
thankfully this is way easier to get back to than the other one fuck man oh man

652
02:43:33,129 --> 02:43:38,569
countering a thrust a foot is not what you think of you think of a sword or a weapon and I keep

02:50:56,489 --> 02:51:19,510

680
02:57:57,299 --> 02:58:03,020
and maybe but we'll see if you guys want to compile them oh by the way if you don't know

681
02:58:03,020 --> 02:58:07,850
I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this because I mean I talked about it last night late

682
02:58:07,850 --> 02:58:15,139
and this morning so every time I die and I have to I do have to confirm that this is like okay

683
02:58:15,219 --> 02:58:20,899
for twitch terms of service but every time I die I was gonna buy a one dollar scratch ticket

684
02:58:20,899 --> 02:58:26,340
or maybe upgrade them into like a bunch of five dollar scratch tickets and then scratch them at

685
02:58:26,340 --> 02:58:32,389
the end after I beat the game if I do hopefully I do this game's fucking brutal but scratch them all

686
02:58:32,389 --> 02:58:39,909
and whatever I get money wise will just be paid community subs whatever it is I need to make sure

687
02:58:39,909 --> 02:58:51,799
that that's like okay though I need to make sure that that's actually like not against like terms

688
02:58:51,799 --> 02:59:05,780
of service somehow so I'm gonna confirm that I'm going into like a new area here what is that

701
03:02:44,170 --> 03:03:07,540
the surety well I'm gonna go for I don't just see what's up here and I unlock this zone might

702
03:03:07,540 --> 03:03:19,319
as well see what it is no it's like a lady

703
03:03:42,860 --> 03:03:43,819

704
03:03:46,059 --> 03:03:49,579
I don't know what's going on out there fuck maybe like a fucking birthday party

705
03:03:50,629 --> 03:04:06,469
I wonder if they got a clown so I get this is just blood-borne yeah this is blood-borne

706
03:04:06,469 --> 03:04:11,700
all right I'm not I don't want to do this I feel like that's I'm gonna be stopped there

707
03:04:11,700 --> 03:04:32,860
let me go back you are the clown uh so this was those two mini bosses I could go back to the

708
03:04:32,860 --> 03:04:53,459
reservoir this is the hmm see if there's anything new here do you have any more info for me I have

709
03:04:53,459 --> 03:05:03,479
one of these tiers but I don't know if I can use it yet oh here we go okay progress yes is the

710
03:05:03,479 --> 03:05:10,200
stagnation in your blood what causes the stagnation the blood has only a limited amount of power

711
03:05:10,200 --> 03:05:17,159
available to it let's say you've used all of this power and then you attempt to resurrect again

712
03:05:17,159 --> 03:05:24,860
the resurrection still occurs but it must draw on power equivalent exchange from those that have

713
03:05:24,860 --> 03:05:32,069
the dragon rod for those who have the dragon rod the natural life force that everyone has

714
03:05:32,709 --> 03:05:41,559
that allows them and function as human beings been taken from them their blood has stagnated

715
03:05:41,559 --> 03:05:50,139
gonna be cured yes by giving back what has been taken here you are dragon's blood droplet

716
03:05:51,219 --> 03:05:57,139
so an item that is really uh by the way I'm gonna mute this for a second because I'm gonna bring up

717
03:05:57,139 --> 03:06:01,700
something I'm gonna just we're gonna listen here for a second let me tell you something ready

718
03:06:02,340 --> 03:06:14,440
I want to make a game show and title the game show birds or small children and see who can

719
03:06:14,440 --> 03:06:27,620
tell the difference if you listen to this could you actually tell because kids like next time

720
03:06:27,620 --> 03:06:44,469
in a grocery store there's a kid being like they sound like birds that could be like a bird habitat

721
03:06:45,030 --> 03:07:07,500
hold on the birthday party must have gone inside yeah I would have different birds making bird

722
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:13,030
noises and then children outside or children at grocery store and see if anybody could really

723
03:07:13,030 --> 03:07:27,530
actually tell the difference sometimes you can't tell all right recovery charm so now I actually

724
03:07:27,530 --> 03:07:34,819
have this so you can offer a dragon's blood droplet to a sculptor's item to restore all

725
03:07:34,819 --> 03:07:48,600
afflicted with the dragon rod all right so I have two of these now right I thought I had two of them

726
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:58,469
didn't I buy one of these oh there's one in storage okay the recovery general's dragon rod

727
03:07:58,469 --> 03:08:02,950
suffers to be healed from sculptors idol a dragon blood droplet can be consumed to heal dragon root

728
03:08:02,950 --> 03:08:08,549
from all those afflicted doing so will cause all rot essence to disappear returning the chances of

729
03:08:08,549 --> 03:08:24,090
receiving unseed a to the default value which what does it know seven percent now the question that

730
03:08:24,090 --> 03:08:31,209
I have for this though is should I use these now or should I say I have two I wonder if I should

731
03:08:31,209 --> 03:08:44,229
save them or will people just start dying I feel like this is the weird from software catch that's

732
03:08:44,229 --> 03:08:51,190
in all these games what do I do with these should I hold on to them I mean maybe I could

733
03:08:51,190 --> 03:09:16,819
just do it I have two dragon rod healed so now I have I have another one so it heals everybody

734
03:09:16,819 --> 03:09:26,309
not just one person okay that's cool what do I got skills right I wanted to this is five

735
03:09:26,950 --> 03:09:41,020
put down here Ichimonji double as a follow-up overhead sword strike to Ichimonji deals high

736
03:09:41,020 --> 03:09:46,860
posture damage and also recovers one's own posture the follow-up attack is especially useful for

737
03:09:46,860 --> 03:09:59,719
preventing enemy counterattacks yeah it's just a much better version of this hmm I want this one

738
03:09:59,719 --> 03:10:12,120
though I'm gonna get this one first all right now the real question of the evening here

739
03:10:13,579 --> 03:10:28,069
is where the fuck do I go now that's a great question yes bottle of sake by given by Emma

740
03:10:28,069 --> 03:10:32,069
sake is a drink meant for sharing doesn't contain water from the fountain that is made from the

741
03:10:32,069 --> 03:10:38,409
purest of waters and as a drink beloved by the people now I want some fucking drink what is it

742
03:10:40,760 --> 03:10:46,440
it's his favorite tea I thought it would be a fitting way to celebrate his return to hell

743
03:10:51,930 --> 03:11:02,920
get drunk give drink wait you just oh he just gave okay maybe I'll make my own like

744
03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:04,200
brewed up fucking sake

745
03:11:20,250 --> 03:11:29,049
don't drink alcohol you're sick no I'm not I'm not sick I just have this lingering I feel better

746
03:11:30,979 --> 03:11:32,579
justify I feel great

747
03:11:48,229 --> 03:11:57,719
that's maybe it'll leave me play better here you know wait we're done here wait so I have

748
03:11:57,719 --> 03:12:03,219
the Ashina sake I have this unrefined shit so this is a case of let me take the product from

749
03:12:03,219 --> 03:12:07,139
over there give this guy the unrefined dog shit one and then keep one for myself and sell it

750
03:12:07,860 --> 03:12:20,700
which one I wonder what if this open maybe this opens up something else take the good one

751
03:12:20,940 --> 03:12:28,260
I brought some tea he smells pretty good the boys I'll have some mix them together

752
03:12:28,979 --> 03:12:39,399
I like one of those now Emma's father about lady Emma's father what go again he was an

753
03:12:39,399 --> 03:12:47,319
extraordinary doctor he drank Emma's father used to pee in a cup and devices better put he was

754
03:12:47,319 --> 03:12:54,040
obsessed with mechanisms tastes just like Emma's father's pee that's my favorite pee seriously but

755
03:12:54,040 --> 03:13:03,670
I owed him I would say that you owe him your life as well what do you mean when I lost my left arm

756
03:13:04,229 --> 03:13:11,799
Dogen created that thing which has now become your left arm the first version was a complete

757
03:13:11,799 --> 03:13:19,299
failure didn't work at all so he then he remade it again and again I tell you it's too easy

758
03:13:19,299 --> 03:13:27,799
sometimes he told me I needed to practice with the prosthetic in order to use it properly

759
03:13:27,799 --> 03:13:34,760
so Emma would pester me into carving her spinning tops and other toys after much

760
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:43,399
training of that sort it came to be called a shinobi fang in other words that prosthetic arm

761
03:13:43,399 --> 03:14:02,340
is Dogen's legacy his legacy so much time has passed by shinobi ways that alone I could not

762
03:14:02,340 --> 03:14:17,030
bear to abandon so any booth us is the face of those who owe a deep karmic debt understand

763
03:14:17,030 --> 03:14:26,459
when you try carving one for yourself so okay ask about your arm all right but I can use various

764
03:14:26,459 --> 03:14:32,459
purifying agents to further hone that purifying agents so if you find something of that simple

765
03:14:33,180 --> 03:14:43,579
purifying agents what about the unrefined one something should I just give this to him

766
03:14:44,139 --> 03:14:59,500
or do I can I use this for a different I wonder if you just take this yeah just take it I brought

767
03:14:59,500 --> 03:15:09,739
some sake don't mind if I do oh Spencer Spencer I got a question for you is it not tear-licking

768
03:15:09,819 --> 03:15:21,159
no it's damn good oh you have no idea okay but it does make my old wounds

769
03:15:21,159 --> 03:15:31,590
ache you're left on yes and this sake was a favorite of the man who is she

770
03:15:31,590 --> 03:15:49,909
is she he did it for my sake did it for my sake oh I was on the verge of being consumed

771
03:15:50,549 --> 03:16:04,739
consumed by what sure well they're talking about sake come on I thought he like cut his arm off to

772
03:16:04,739 --> 03:16:33,059
get his secret crabby patty sake recipe I don't know okay I hope you enjoyed that sake all right

773
03:16:33,059 --> 03:16:39,059
I don't have any seeds so what do I need to do now look at that bad bad game design bad game design

774
03:16:39,059 --> 03:17:02,180
look at that blurry like bug patch right there bad game development game dev no nevermind all right

775
03:17:02,180 --> 03:17:07,940
I've wasted enough time bottoms hole I don't think there's anywhere else I can go let me go

776
03:17:07,940 --> 03:17:25,510
back here let's take a look so this is the reservoir no the heat that that boss was up there

777
03:17:26,549 --> 03:17:43,799
he's dead um I feel like there was another place to go wasn't there this is the castle

778
03:17:48,059 --> 03:17:57,500
yeah let me go back out there was that spot up the stairs yeah right here up this way

779
03:17:58,059 --> 03:18:10,309
I'm no lawyer man but I just read the terms of service and I feel like scratch cards are okay

780
03:18:11,430 --> 03:18:18,680
but here's another thing though not just scratch cards but whatever money is one off the scratch

781
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:24,889
cards I buy a bunch of community subs subs with that I'm gonna I'll add that's like a that's a

782
03:18:24,889 --> 03:18:38,620
weird like roundabout thing I gotta like ask maybe or it could just be to charity too charity yeah

783
03:18:38,620 --> 03:18:48,569
no that's a good idea as well now let's rest here and then I'm gonna take a look upstairs

784
03:18:49,209 --> 03:19:01,819
so there's that let me just see what's up this way there's a

785
03:19:03,500 --> 03:19:16,469
I could go this way let's check over here no I mean I've been uh I've just I hate this game

794
03:21:46,389 --> 03:22:28,299

something like that sure by the by I'm a little out of got the goods but in the cellar too vendor

871
03:48:15,159 --> 03:48:25,260
waiting for someone like you to show up oh bite down on your controller secrets shinobi drug

872
03:48:25,979 --> 03:48:30,379
when times call for death by one's own hand samurai turn their swords on themselves

873
03:48:31,100 --> 03:48:36,620
as a matter of pride while shinobi demand a swifter means simply crush in the back teeth to die

874
03:48:38,389 --> 03:48:48,459
nothing more is required resurrection is not limited after use why would I want these

875
03:48:52,090 --> 03:49:04,500
resurrections not limited after use so what I said the attack can't but these iron fortress

876
03:49:10,260 --> 03:49:15,959
can be fit into the shinobi prosthetic become a working prosthetic tool experienced iron ribbed

877
03:49:15,959 --> 03:49:29,959
fan users can deflect arrows and even bullets using this tool oh it won't it wouldn't be

878
03:49:29,959 --> 03:49:35,690
surprising if the next owner decided to wait was impractical so it's just a giant metal shield

879
03:49:35,690 --> 03:49:42,260
to block from arrows and bullets okay what about this anti-air it's a shinobi martial art anti-air

880
03:49:42,260 --> 03:49:48,010
death blow a technique technique which serves the shinobi who is not bound by the earth in battle

881
03:49:48,010 --> 03:49:53,530
leap towards an opponent who has exposed himself in mid-air and strike killing him before he hits

882
03:49:53,530 --> 03:50:16,780
the ground huh okay well I got money I got coin bags how many do I have how much is this is this

883
03:50:16,780 --> 03:50:33,030

884
03:50:33,030 --> 03:50:45,450

things make their way yeah we already come up with bucks if you have nothing in the box let's take

929
04:03:54,090 --> 04:04:05,059
a look at this one more time anti-air death blow so looking for anti-air death blow in the skills

930
04:04:05,059 --> 04:04:18,569
menu there it is okay so it's it's just here right trigger near an enemy high up in the air

931
04:04:19,770 --> 04:04:31,819
so it's a death blow if they're in the air only okay I think it's time for me to go so where was

932
04:04:31,819 --> 04:04:44,649
I going the old grave is where I was in the bottomless hole I'm gonna go just back to the

933
04:04:44,649 --> 04:05:03,059
old end of the stream no I'm fine stopping for a while okay so let's see I already did everything

934
04:05:03,059 --> 04:05:16,809
down there which leads us back this way maybe there's that general out here I did kind of just

935
04:05:16,809 --> 04:05:32,680
speed through that area over here did I already look through here yeah so the grave was maybe

936
04:05:32,680 --> 04:05:55,219
like just take a peek out here I don't think so remember I I could not even fucking I couldn't

937
04:05:55,219 --> 04:06:04,389
kill these guys it's so weird just how you see how you progress progress through these games

938
04:06:05,909 --> 04:06:13,739
I couldn't even attempt to fight those guys yesterday all right so we go let's go this way

939
04:06:14,540 --> 04:06:58,899
across the bridge eavesdrop I do I'm streaming Shakira salt who's the bigger threat

940
04:07:00,059 --> 04:07:34,940
uh I don't know that guy that guy's this guy his sword is like I know I'm gonna regret not ever

941
04:07:34,940 --> 04:07:46,360
using one of these all right well there is tall grass here to hide in something just fell from a

942
04:07:46,360 --> 04:08:03,459
tree what are they I don't know what they are is it people is it bugs wizards what is it gonna

943
04:08:03,459 --> 04:08:46,520
dash what is it it's a monkey that was funny they're not that dangerous so let's see if there's

944
04:08:46,520 --> 04:08:55,450
anything else over here can I get on top of the trees makes sense right that sounded like me

945
04:08:55,450 --> 04:09:24,489
screaming I'm a monster why I'm being attacked I'm being swarmed that didn't feel good I felt

946
04:09:24,489 --> 04:09:48,260
bad that's unnecessary anything else besides just like chimpanzees I think I'm good but I'm

947
04:09:48,260 --> 04:10:01,590
gonna be cautious still uh all right uh just a house anything inside of the house that's a

948
04:10:01,590 --> 04:10:22,780
real question those balloons of spirit well here we go always triple check

949
04:10:23,180 --> 04:11:05,739
uh-huh that leads us to here can I make this jump I don't know maybe I guess so yeah oh shit um

950
04:11:06,299 --> 04:11:37,829
what is down this way have I already gotten this no there's an item sunken valley uh I

951
04:11:38,469 --> 04:11:46,860
I was on my way and this is like looks like another area this is a new area

952
04:11:47,739 --> 04:11:55,180
so sunken valley is down that way I gotta remember that uh I was gonna teleport back up to

953
04:11:55,180 --> 04:12:00,360
there wait what about over here god damn it I mean I kind of have to let me just see what's

954
04:12:00,360 --> 04:12:19,610
over here shit he's that's quick he's got a gun on top of that wow that's a pretty cool weapon

955
04:12:20,649 --> 04:12:44,389
blood-borne weapon this way um so many paths to choose from I don't know which one to go through

956
04:12:44,389 --> 04:13:17,159
I could go over here I guess through the mist snowy the outskirts this looks like an area

957
04:13:17,159 --> 04:13:53,209
where you fight a guy like that I don't know if this is a boss though prey slaughtered what just

958
04:13:53,209 --> 04:14:12,969
a free prayer bead and a pacifying agent okay so reduces terror buildup it's just like a that's

959
04:14:12,969 --> 04:14:35,459
cool it's like a little pond all right drink from pond that's another one right here they

960
04:14:35,459 --> 04:14:55,049
tried to be sneaky and hide it behind the ice another pacifying agent okay cool that's a cool

961
04:14:55,049 --> 04:15:11,420
little spot I'll just take I'll take the prayer bead it's very useful nice what was that guy

962
04:15:11,420 --> 04:15:35,180
doing down here he just like sharpening his wooden stick I killed him for literally no reason well I

963
04:15:35,180 --> 04:15:40,549
did kill him for a reason because if I didn't kill him he was gonna try to kill me I preemptively

964
04:15:40,549 --> 04:16:02,090
killed that guy to protect myself which leads to this way back to the all right now I can go down

965
04:16:02,090 --> 04:16:08,090
that's case sunken valley down here or I'm gonna go back to that other teleporter that I just

966
04:16:08,090 --> 04:16:24,819
unlocked and which one was it this one right here can you play minecraft now thanks in advance

967
04:16:28,200 --> 04:16:47,420
um no I'm not gonna play minecraft sorry in advance eel liver greatly reduces the amount

968
04:16:47,420 --> 04:16:59,620
of damage received from lightning attacks as well as shock status abnormality okay is there

969
04:16:59,620 --> 04:17:18,600
nothing else I can do over here yeah this brings us back down to like sunken valley

970
04:17:19,239 --> 04:17:26,069
was there somewhere in this behind maybe I feel like I didn't get to the end of that last

971
04:17:26,069 --> 04:18:01,579
exploration over here no uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh I'm gonna just turn around because when the

972
04:18:01,579 --> 04:18:11,180
gods of the great was flying down I didn't keep going that way I went down so if that's the case

973
04:18:11,180 --> 04:18:19,700
then I should come back out here and go back up right not this one which one was it is this the

974
04:18:19,700 --> 04:18:28,459
closest one if I come out and go back around I think it is we'll find out in a second won't we

1023
04:30:25,270 --> 04:30:40,010
this is probably a boss that'll put me at yeah because that'll be 1500 next time I could also

1024
04:30:40,010 --> 04:30:55,700
just grind for money but I don't know if I really want to do that upper tower antechamber hey

1025
04:30:55,700 --> 04:31:03,959
spoilers this game has bosses oh change the language right right right I'm sorry I keep

1028
04:31:45,139 --> 04:31:58,090
oh that's a thrust okay he's got a lot of fake outs oh that gets like a full second after that

1029
04:31:58,090 --> 04:32:18,739
almost this is the cat the casting call for if you can fight this boss or not apparently

1030
04:32:18,979 --> 04:32:39,659
through this door all right um nothing else in this house let's do it again

1031
04:32:40,600 --> 04:33:09,909
discovery spawn that's much easier that's the real that's canon right there oh shit okay there's a

1032
04:33:09,909 --> 04:33:22,700
whole new area okay left right these are new enemies there's a guy like a window shop over

1033
04:33:22,700 --> 04:34:02,099
there okay let's try does this work yes I'm surprised that actually did that now come on

1034
04:34:02,099 --> 04:34:21,819
what does this impasse here why don't you turn around which way you're gonna go go left no shit

1035
04:34:29,110 --> 04:34:43,209
back it up back it up I'm dead oh you know that guy don't you there we go it's always a thrust

1036
04:34:43,209 --> 04:35:00,729
there's a lady oh please no oh I'm just a maid for fuck's sake should I not have done that

1037
04:35:04,060 --> 04:35:39,849
uh quickly get it this guy's not wearing pants they both swing at the same time I didn't block

1038
04:35:39,849 --> 04:36:00,119
that one oh I'm out of stamina or something hey all right fighting you and your dad in the same

1039
04:36:00,119 --> 04:36:16,700
room is not gonna work just get me the hell out of here where's my dad how come I don't get a dad

1040
04:36:43,380 --> 04:37:01,959
oh my god I hate you I hate you I'm just give me all the stuff in case I die that's pretty good

1041
04:37:01,959 --> 04:37:35,220
scrap iron oh sugar come on I'll take a lock on please no dad holy shit he really is like pissed

1042
04:37:35,299 --> 04:37:51,819
off about this oh my fucking god he's gonna get he's gonna get vengeance for dad isn't it okay

1043
04:37:51,819 --> 04:37:57,580
that was way sloppier than it really needed to be I have seven skill points I think I should

1044
04:37:57,580 --> 04:38:19,529
probably take care of this I'm gonna go down oh man okay uh I gotta put some points in I collected

1045
04:38:19,529 --> 04:38:31,700
pretty much everything I needed to collect right this is important so down here I was doing this

1046
04:38:31,700 --> 04:38:37,900
path this one reduces the amount of damage to posture when attacked by an enemy with a sword

1047
04:38:37,900 --> 04:38:48,759
cool I really want this Ashina cross requires the combat art Ashina cross

1048
04:38:49,639 --> 04:38:59,110
from a sheathed stance draw the blade at high speed it costs spirit emblems to use hold the

1049
04:38:59,110 --> 04:39:12,310
stance to intercept at will interesting okay wasn't there this I'm gonna wait for this one

1050
04:39:12,310 --> 04:39:22,819
I want the extra heal unless this is not bad either excuse me just extra spirit emblems

1051
04:39:22,819 --> 04:39:35,580
is just useful I think I'll get it what's this recovers vitality upon performing a successful

1052
04:39:35,580 --> 04:39:52,200
death blow that's also really good now I'll get this one yeah it doesn't go up by hold on a minute

1053
04:39:52,200 --> 04:40:13,500
did that only go up by one emblem that doesn't seem worth it um okay interesting all right uh

1054
04:40:14,700 --> 04:40:17,259
let's try to sneakily get through this area

1055
04:40:17,259 --> 04:40:48,520
up or down let's see down I guess but does this not open I feel like I should be able to open this

1056
04:40:49,400 --> 04:41:05,209
how did the guy with the no pants get in here that's what I wonder all right so now I'm gonna

1057
04:41:06,330 --> 04:41:14,220
I could fall down and try to kill one of them go for just a jump here I think that's what I'm

1058
04:41:14,220 --> 04:41:43,270
gonna try imagine that happened in front of you it just did it did just happen more eel

1059
04:41:43,270 --> 04:41:52,330
liver that's the electricity one all right roomful items posture damage all right the next box the

1060
04:41:52,330 --> 04:42:06,069
next boss we're already opening this one I'm gonna try to eat those candies uh is it an ancient

1061
04:42:06,069 --> 04:42:17,990
kodachi short sword this is a new tool is it a second weapon I don't think so I think you

1062
04:42:17,990 --> 04:42:38,810
only get the katana right this is the door I couldn't get in before cool okay so then if I

1063
04:42:38,810 --> 04:42:50,919
wanted to this is okay there's this one there yeah cool nice shortcut that's a sweep

1064
04:42:53,159 --> 04:43:15,259
well cool good thing I just lost half my fucking money unbelievable what's the point why did I

1065
04:43:15,259 --> 04:43:21,689
I don't even care about this shortcut why do I care about this this just made this worse for me

1066
04:43:21,689 --> 04:43:35,990
this made it hard to get through right because this is just oh my god I forgot about these guys

1067
04:43:35,990 --> 04:43:56,979
were spawning uh I'm going back to town I'm going back to town I'm gonna buy the the pouches because

1068
04:43:56,979 --> 04:44:15,770
I have like 300 I need to just store it I'll be so close I can only afford two of these sell just

1069
04:44:15,849 --> 04:44:22,009
something stupid how many vases do I have yeah just sell like fucking two of these

1070
04:44:23,299 --> 04:44:33,500
that's all I need yeah you're right I haven't even opened the umbrella that's true

1071
04:44:34,299 --> 04:45:03,240
so this puts us down here wait no what's this this one oh the new prosthetic too

1072
04:45:03,240 --> 04:45:10,840
ah I'll do it in a minute damn it there's a lot going on in my brain with this

1073
04:45:12,919 --> 04:45:24,299
stop I haven't even used I haven't even used the one I just got I don't know what it looks like

1074
04:45:35,180 --> 04:45:56,060
all right so it's the sabi maru let's take a look at it the blue poisonous rust on the blade

1075
04:45:56,060 --> 04:46:02,470
applies poison status prosthetic tool with the blade allowing for a quick series of attacks

1076
04:46:02,470 --> 04:46:14,540
together with the sword I'll give it a try and it does poison that's cool I already did the gourd

1077
04:46:14,540 --> 04:46:25,419
seed no okay I have I have almost enough money to buy that seed let's keep progress moving here

1078
04:46:35,450 --> 04:46:55,080
take your time sweet boy show umbrella oh it's just okay now what about this that's not bad

1079
04:47:02,700 --> 04:47:06,500
it's really not you can probably supplement it for a little all right

1080
04:47:09,349 --> 04:47:31,049
come on you think you're gonna get it off you're not so I'm at the bottom of this tower

1081
04:47:35,110 --> 04:47:40,360
backstab the guy take out his buddies and then I'm not sure if there's anywhere I can go from here

1082
04:47:51,830 --> 04:48:12,419
hello the bonfire at the top as well yeah that's true I just want to see if there's

1083
04:48:12,419 --> 04:48:16,330
anything else down here because it's easier to go from here than it is to go from the top

1084
04:48:18,790 --> 04:48:38,380
there is a way over here another shortcut oh this is the don't go steal their

1085
04:48:38,380 --> 04:48:41,419
fucking lucky charms and get out of here this is the general here

1086
04:49:13,259 --> 04:49:17,580
that's one way to stand up okay I had to listen to the whole thing first

1087
04:49:19,220 --> 04:49:31,459
what's in here divine grass this is the full complete all heal that I'm not going to use

1088
04:49:31,459 --> 04:49:39,639
at all I may have you know what I'm think I'm going to sell that because realistically think

1089
04:49:39,639 --> 04:49:43,959
about it in games like these when they're so hard and you die all the time you never know when to

1090
04:49:43,959 --> 04:49:51,000
use them I know a good opportunity sell it so you get money for it because if you use that and die

1091
04:49:51,000 --> 04:50:08,810
at a boss it's gone you didn't kill the boss I can use that money for other shit this is probably

1092
04:50:08,810 --> 04:50:25,270
a bad idea somebody behind me now who's behind me somebody throwing rocks who's throwing rocks

1093
04:50:25,270 --> 04:50:42,619
at me that's a slash all right what's this idiot up here it's okay I gotta memorize this shit

1094
04:50:44,970 --> 04:51:44,979
you fucking asshole hit shut up over here god does he have two he's got him both back

1095
04:51:45,540 --> 04:51:52,970
I gotta fight him over here fuck whatever oh my god I'm just boning back to the bonfire

1096
04:51:53,529 --> 04:52:09,270
oh god's sake there is a strategy that's possible and that's just kill the guy next to him no

1097
04:52:09,270 --> 04:52:20,919
okay kill the guy next to him kill everybody then once everyone's reset go from there right

1098
04:52:20,919 --> 04:52:35,240
so I can just keep picking them off one by one and then he'll eventually reset with two and I

1099
04:52:35,240 --> 04:52:59,400
just go behind him and kill him I hope they don't come in here they're not that's not this stupid

1100
04:52:59,400 --> 04:53:11,400
they're too dumb to come in here right you ever played this game before Jeremy come on

1101
04:53:12,709 --> 04:53:56,630

1136
05:04:27,659 --> 05:04:35,909
door this is gonna be another one of those situations took me so long to kill it took me

1137
05:04:35,909 --> 05:04:44,819
so fun to kill the last mini boss I'm seeing I'm looking up I'm at the bottom of a giant skyscraper

1138
05:04:45,380 --> 05:04:54,549
and I just know it's gonna be a very long climb to get up there and I got two plungers

1139
05:04:56,360 --> 05:05:00,520
they're guaranteed to work they're not some weird like little fucking gremlin guy

1140
05:05:01,990 --> 05:05:08,389
yeah hey I guarantee you these will work 100 the plunger is perfectly fine they work

1141
05:05:09,189 --> 05:05:16,009
but I have to climb up like that side of the empire state building plungers

1142
05:05:17,029 --> 05:05:18,709
and now what if I'm already fucking it up

1143
05:05:38,970 --> 05:05:47,909
isn't there one of those things up here why did it not grab the wall

1144
05:05:50,520 --> 05:06:00,439
why can I not grab that what why I'm so flustered right now

1145
05:06:01,159 --> 05:06:05,700
I need to go eat like a Snickers I'm gonna shove the Snickers up my fucking nose

1146
05:06:17,080 --> 05:06:24,810
okay what was my plan here though what's the plan I don't have a plan it was to kill guys

1147
05:06:25,990 --> 05:06:35,369
don't even think about it I don't have I don't have a plan there's no plan I have to come from

1148
05:06:35,369 --> 05:06:59,240
this way where did they come from I don't have a goddamn plan the plan is to you gotta backstab

1149
05:06:59,240 --> 05:07:05,819
the big guy and then just deal with all the other people that's just how it works I mean it's how

1150
05:07:05,819 --> 05:07:13,099
I'm gonna do it I might be wrong I'm definitely wrong but every time I play the way I think is

1151
05:07:13,099 --> 05:07:18,950
wrong I end up winning you all know it look at every boss fight everything every encounter

1152
05:07:19,750 --> 05:07:44,939
what do you got fight him in this stupid room

1153
05:07:50,810 --> 05:08:05,400
slash dash what what would you do that for he felt bad for me he just gave me a free hit

1154
05:08:06,119 --> 05:08:09,799
yeah I mean you're doing really terribly people that just make it fun of you so I'm gonna make

1155
05:08:09,799 --> 05:08:21,700
it easy I'm getting trolled right now by a guy in pvp he knows he's gonna kick my ass I think

1156
05:08:21,700 --> 05:08:24,900
actually you know it's funny I think this has actually happened before when I played in Dark

1157
05:08:24,900 --> 05:08:45,180
Souls pvp and then they one hit kill me what are you doing are you not gonna fight me inside why

1158
05:08:45,180 --> 05:08:59,939
you want to fight me over here which fuck okay at least he's in the room that was a sweep I

1159
05:08:59,939 --> 05:09:11,580
thought it was the thrust fuck me look at his health though like come on he's so close to this

1160
05:09:12,779 --> 05:09:44,380
there's one oh my frames are dying dropped frames everywhere I think we're good dash

1161
05:09:44,380 --> 05:09:52,630
holy fuck how did he not hit me with that I have no idea I wish you would stay in this room

1162
05:09:53,430 --> 05:10:26,099

1163
05:10:39,209 --> 05:10:59,130
don't you think about this don't you think about this he doesn't like fireworks

1164
05:10:59,130 --> 05:11:48,919
did you actually just do that all right cool so now what do I do first try more like I want you

1165
05:11:48,919 --> 05:11:58,040
to take a moment everybody to understand the first time I did it the stupid fucking way that I wanted

1166
05:11:58,040 --> 05:12:04,250
to do it and it works I have to just trust my instincts here do what if I like sneak up

1167
05:12:11,450 --> 05:12:33,270
you don't know that's Waldo from uh what's his name Waldo from the simpsons I don't know his

05:12:33,270 --> 05:12:38,069
name the guy that drives the bus oh fuck I have guns all right wait wait wait wait

1169
05:12:39,509 --> 05:12:59,610
now just that's how this game works I one shot at the drunk boss by killing his guys running

1170
05:12:59,610 --> 05:13:10,299
and rinse and repeat then I okay can I please no wait no oh excuse you didn't forget about me

1171
05:13:13,799 --> 05:13:22,869
I don't want to throw us utensils down I don't I think I can get out of here now

1172
05:13:22,869 --> 05:13:31,259
hey don't you forget about looking at me I think that's it there's nothing else I can do I have

1173
05:13:31,259 --> 05:14:16,090
to go now go all the way up the tower maybe don't be a fool what oh right up the stairs oh I don't

1174
05:14:16,090 --> 05:14:31,939
think upstairs maybe maybe um I actually have no idea what do we have what are half the places

1175
05:14:31,939 --> 05:14:43,180
here there's up here where the that first top of the tower is there's I could go back I could go

1176
05:14:43,180 --> 05:14:58,810
down to that sunken valley let me see there's that way down towards the monkeys but that goes

1177
05:14:58,810 --> 05:15:13,700
down to the sunken village place let me go back up like the top of the building just go all the

1178
05:15:13,700 --> 05:15:46,139

movement impossible but if one is struck while in the air the lightning can be dispelled from

race car noises that was a cool fight that was really fun but turns the spraying blood of a

1282
05:50:33,909 --> 05:50:42,259
victim to smoke activated after a backstab death blow the smoke screen allows for one to retake

1283
05:50:42,259 --> 05:50:51,939
the element of surprise damn only be used after performing a backstab death blow they must be

1284
05:50:51,939 --> 05:51:05,540
equipped in the equipment menu interesting so all the issues I was having with the the group at

1285
05:51:05,540 --> 05:51:14,229
the top of the stairs you were victorious interesting you can just go back into hiding

1286
05:51:14,229 --> 05:51:28,680
are you shinobi of the divine yeah there is xp and levels in the game I don't have to do

1287
05:51:28,680 --> 05:51:41,669
this again do I do I have to find the third time phase three no this lamp is everything to me

1288
05:51:45,099 --> 05:52:20,540
for her sake no I even got the like unlock thing so your final boss you're going to turn into a

1289
05:52:20,540 --> 05:52:40,060
demon or something okay he's self uh I have seven points what about my son where's my little like

son um nope this is it right here here we go I wanted to buy this so this makes the heal even

1291
05:53:02,409 --> 05:53:14,569
better what is the final move here living force allows him to perform a follow-up attack with

1292
05:53:14,569 --> 05:53:24,630
certain tools that imbues the sword with the tools effect huh after using certain prosthetic tools

1293
05:53:24,630 --> 05:53:30,389
right trigger is living force the sword is imbued with the tools effect the only one that I have

1294
05:53:30,389 --> 05:53:40,810
right now is flame fence I turn to a flame sword okay cool still have two points I don't want to

1295
05:53:40,810 --> 05:54:00,040
spend it on anything though uh I'll probably just get this either that or maybe this too

1296
05:54:00,759 --> 05:54:06,389
I'm not sure I want to go all the way down this tree that doesn't seem that interesting to me

1297
05:54:12,619 --> 05:54:20,819
or no this is cool too no I'm gonna I'm saving it that's the moment you get health back uh I'm

1301
05:57:51,419 --> 05:57:58,840
max health and posture then I can also do more attack power right yeah from the genichiro

1302
05:58:02,169 --> 05:58:05,209
although distant recollection of such a memory provided substance to the wolf

1303
05:58:06,090 --> 05:58:11,450
born a peasant genichiro ishino was taken in by the ishina after his mother's death

1304
05:58:12,169 --> 05:58:18,330
with his country on the brink of defeat genichiro took to a heretical axe and

1305
05:58:18,330 --> 05:58:29,939
mastered the lightning of tamo such heresy may be the key to saving her damn all right awesome

1306
05:58:31,220 --> 05:58:42,580
did the skills rested up a little I guess we can talk to the lady seems the next course of

1307
05:58:42,580 --> 05:58:52,840
progression here let's see I've managed to fill my mask to give you my thanks who exactly do you

1308
05:58:52,840 --> 05:59:09,139
serve ishina I'm a doctor in the service no desire to use the power of the dragon heritage

1309
05:59:09,139 --> 05:59:16,419

1314
06:00:07,139 --> 06:00:14,259
undying one something goes for you yes my lord I wish to save you I'm sure that I would

1315
06:00:14,259 --> 06:00:21,220
know already happened thing given another chance however undying begets stagnation the immortal

1316
06:00:21,220 --> 06:00:29,939
oath the rejuvenating waters the dragon rot they all corrupt men to the point that they no longer

1317
06:00:29,939 --> 06:00:36,340
live as men I wish to sever the chains of stagnation bred by the dragon's heritage

1318
06:00:36,340 --> 06:00:44,099
wolf will you help me achieve this aim this sounds like the text to speech voice

1319
06:00:44,979 --> 06:01:05,459
I was trying to figure out in my head what that was it is um how are these not the same thing

1320
06:01:06,650 --> 06:01:21,500
help kuro obey the iron code help kuro this is telltale level of choice here yeah this is yes

1321
06:01:21,500 --> 06:01:47,959
or hell yes I have hell he wants to die but what about my code yes or yes in a bad way

1322
06:01:48,619 --> 06:02:06,939
I think I have to obey the code if I was in this position I would say dude you know how many bosses

1323
06:02:06,939 --> 06:02:11,419
I've had to fight and kill to protect you to come find you and for me just to kill you you're not

1324
06:02:11,419 --> 06:02:24,729
even a boss uh-uh obey the iron code to protect you the divine air that was the duty my father

1325
06:02:24,729 --> 06:02:31,689
entrusted to me how many times have you died and come back to life for my sake two three times

1326
06:02:34,409 --> 06:02:40,810
you severely underestimate how bad I am at the game how many times have you died two three

1327
06:02:42,490 --> 06:02:47,639
uh yeah yeah only only three times yep yep that's me I'm really good

1328
06:02:51,639 --> 06:03:10,119
thank you what does he know we are seeking to sever the immortal ties I know a good place to

1329
06:03:10,119 --> 06:03:15,639
start where tell me the next place to go the sunken temple book from kuro on the art of

1330
06:03:15,639 --> 06:03:21,560
severing ties with the dragon's heritage it looks old the binding is torn and several pages are

1331
06:03:21,560 --> 06:03:27,400
missing herein describes the means to perform the rite of immortal severance beyond the fountain

1332
06:03:27,400 --> 06:03:33,240
head palace locate the sanctuary and imbibe the tears of the holy dragon of the divine realm

1333
06:03:34,200 --> 06:03:40,860
okay it's an ancient record that was kept in I can read I can read

1334
06:03:40,939 --> 06:03:49,020
good dragon it is my belief cuts him up puts his hand up close excuse me

1335
06:03:52,409 --> 06:04:04,020
the divine that incense burner over there it belonged to a person of interest

1336
06:04:04,979 --> 06:04:15,349
take a look now he's trying to slash is it this cactus over here is there something special about

1337
06:04:15,349 --> 06:04:22,950
it oh no it's a dimple long ago there was another divine heir living here in ashina castle his name

1338
06:04:22,950 --> 06:04:29,990
was lord takeru this incense burner belonged to him where is he now he died a long time ago

1339
06:04:29,990 --> 06:04:36,869
apparently wrapped in the aroma of the fountain head I returned to the divine realm those are

1340
06:04:36,869 --> 06:04:44,069
supposedly the words he left behind text is sent of the fountain head is the key to reaching the

1341
06:04:44,069 --> 06:04:51,029
divine realm that is my belief let us discover the truth together I might have to change the

1342
06:04:51,029 --> 06:05:09,130
voice because of that text to speech fucking donation messages all right well cool sounds

1343
06:05:09,130 --> 06:05:16,580
good where where do we go where to now as to how I am certain some of lord takeru's books remain

1344
06:05:16,580 --> 06:05:21,779
in this castle books that he collected in order to find the divine find the books I will search

1345
06:05:21,779 --> 06:05:28,659
for them in addition to finding a way to reach the divine realm might we also look into how we might

1346
06:05:28,659 --> 06:05:36,340
sever the immortal ties a fine suggestion talk to ishii if anyone knows the answer it is him

06:32:10,950 --> 06:32:25,479
here we go you gotta be kidding me really what how did I fuck that up where was the

1451
06:32:25,560 --> 06:32:31,959
I that wasn't there before how did I screw this up because there were other smoke signals all

1452
06:32:31,959 --> 06:32:53,799
over the place no god damn it I'm sure who cares what who cares how I got here like who gives a

1453
06:32:53,799 --> 06:33:09,209
shit I got there I don't know how I got how would you put a smoke signal outside the front of your

1454
06:33:09,209 --> 06:33:19,500
house I can't and by the way that's not even on the roof that smoke signal is clearly on his balcony

1455
06:33:19,979 --> 06:33:27,270
this guy's a grade a dickhead tell him it's on the roof get to the roof

1456
06:33:27,270 --> 06:33:35,849
oh if I could slash in my wood about the divine air's life yes there is something I wish to ask

1457
06:33:35,849 --> 06:33:47,509
before that sake what you earned thank you are we gonna go back and give this to the guy

1458
06:33:48,549 --> 06:33:53,909
bewitched by the rejuvenating mortars you did well to put a stop to that for me you have my

1459
06:33:53,909 --> 06:34:02,020
thanks I merely followed the code my father taught me the iron code of the shinobi I see

1460
06:34:02,900 --> 06:34:08,340
so you're the son of all that boy he found during the rebellion talk is pretty good

1461
06:34:16,169 --> 06:34:16,889
don't you think

1462
06:34:19,290 --> 06:34:31,259
wait it's the guy's mask the divine air's desire is to sever the ties of immortality

1463
06:34:31,259 --> 06:34:36,540
is the guy that had to kill the rats can be done the mortal blade if you had such a weapon

1464
06:34:37,500 --> 06:34:45,689
may be the key to what you're after blade with it you could kill one who cannot die through normal

1465
06:34:45,689 --> 06:34:52,200
means if I gave that back to him that'd be really disrespectful the infested I believe I've not

1466
06:34:52,200 --> 06:34:57,799
seen one before but it said you could stab them through the heart or remove their head

1467
06:34:58,520 --> 06:35:05,590
and they wouldn't die if the stories are true they'd surely be quite fearsome

1468
06:35:06,630 --> 06:35:17,259
to kill a monster such as that you'd need the mortal blade where can I get that

1469
06:35:18,150 --> 06:35:24,950
where is this mortal blade right here it's held in simple temple however they say the mortal

1470
06:35:24,950 --> 06:35:31,909
blade right behind me take it I am not certain of the meaning it's just here sir

1471
06:35:32,549 --> 06:35:38,069
hmm the gates to that temple are closed now though who knows what those degenerates are

1472
06:35:38,069 --> 06:35:44,389
doing shut away up there in the mountains there aren't any sunk in the temple how do I get there

1473
06:35:44,389 --> 06:35:49,349
the abandoned dungeon just outside of Ashina castle if you can pass through its waterways

1474
06:35:49,990 --> 06:36:01,430
you should find your way all right you're leaving Sekiro severing immortality Sekiro

or Sekiro it's Sekiro the plans and desires of those involved churn endlessly

1476
06:36:08,470 --> 06:36:18,869
if you hesitate you'll be swept away and lose the battle that's right best you keep it in Sekiro

1477
06:36:18,869 --> 06:36:33,959
Sekiro Sekiro hesitate and you lose Sekiro what hello what's going on

1484
06:38:54,299 --> 06:39:08,169

1491
06:42:42,229 --> 06:43:06,790
where are you are you here yes for defeating Kenichiro there's a lady oh to think that Lord

1492
06:43:06,790 --> 06:43:13,189
Kenichiro would go as far as to drink the rejuvenating rejuvenating sediment that's

1493
06:43:13,189 --> 06:43:20,310
what we call a particularly concentrated part of the rejuvenating waters I'm sure you saw it

1494
06:43:20,310 --> 06:43:27,990
for yourself the rejuvenating sediment grants great resilience in one's flesh one becomes able

1495
06:43:27,990 --> 06:43:35,750
to withstand blows that would be fatal to anyone else nice my mentor Dogen devoted much research

1496
06:43:35,750 --> 06:43:45,189
to its uses but all of his work documents medicines everything were burned and destroyed

1497
06:43:45,189 --> 06:43:52,680
I'm not sure who but I heard one of the senior apprentices was able to salvage some of it

1498
06:43:52,759 --> 06:44:03,590
probably dojun did you ask lord crowe's thoughts on the matter I did and we've decided to sever the

1499
06:44:03,590 --> 06:44:11,880
ties of immortality I see I thank you for all of the help you've given me almost sounds like

1500
06:44:11,880 --> 06:44:19,400
you're bidding me farewell I've carried out my lord's orders so I will stay here in the castle

1501
06:44:19,400 --> 06:44:25,240
come and speak to me whenever you please I will provide my assistance to you as a doctor

1502
06:44:26,759 --> 06:44:35,080
oh okay it's said to be a power those who have been given the power of resurrection

1503
06:44:35,080 --> 06:44:41,319
so we have a new fire keeper is what I would classify it but

1504
06:44:44,409 --> 06:45:05,290
goodbye gun for shrine key the gate behind the shrine's idol is made to be

1505
06:45:05,290 --> 06:45:10,900
opened the sunken valley clan will shoot any stranger who approaches and the snake eyes guns

1506
06:45:10,900 --> 06:45:16,389
are particularly feared this elite group of women are descendants of the ancient okami clan

1507
06:45:16,950 --> 06:45:21,830
their especially sharp eyes allow them to snipe victims a great range got the key

1508
06:45:32,619 --> 06:45:39,180
you're back did you meet with lord ishin I did he said the mortal blade it could be the key to

1509
06:45:39,180 --> 06:45:45,180
severing immortality the keys of it it's a sword why smart clicks on it shouldn't be

1510
06:45:46,380 --> 06:45:55,500
it can be found at senpo temple I see yes that seems promising as you say for my part I hunted

1511
06:45:55,500 --> 06:46:02,139
for any books that may contain clues about the aroma of the fountainhead it seems lord takeru

1512
06:46:02,139 --> 06:46:08,700
indeed sought a way to reach the divine realm so far I found one piece of relevant information

1513
06:46:08,700 --> 06:46:19,380
what is it a flower show the droplet my lord could this be it's a sakura droplet

1514
06:46:19,380 --> 06:46:25,860
that's when the undying pledge of the dragon's heritage is broken it said that this remains in

1515
06:46:25,860 --> 06:46:31,939
place of the oath do you think this one was left behind by lord takeru that seems likely why are

1516
06:46:31,939 --> 06:46:37,700
you streaming if you so desire I don't use this that's kind of a loaded question it's got a lot

1517
06:46:37,700 --> 06:46:45,380
of answers to it give the droplet or keep the droplet what are you gonna do with it

1518
06:46:45,380 --> 06:46:59,369
I only have one more I only have one of these I already used one I wonder what this does if

1519
06:46:59,369 --> 06:47:14,490
you give it to him if you should be so kind of course close your eyes my lord what lord takeru's

1520
06:47:14,490 --> 06:47:33,860
dragon blood lives on with you wait he's wait I humbly accept yes what you may open your eyes

1521
06:47:33,860 --> 06:47:50,220
now my lord was a boon granted by lord takeru you can turn your monitor back on yes better

1522
06:47:50,220 --> 06:48:00,569
resurrected power the flower first it is said that relatives of tomo once gathered the fountainhead

1523
06:48:00,650 --> 06:48:04,250
fragrance and arrived at the palace you may find a key where the waters of rejuvenation

1524
06:48:04,250 --> 06:48:11,990
converge in a deep pool and why do you deeply fragrant flower lord takeru left it behind

1525
06:48:11,990 --> 06:48:18,069
I was looking for information on the fountainhead aroma and how it relates to the divine realm

1526
06:48:18,069 --> 06:48:23,750
there is water that flows from the fountainhead through ashina and the book speaks of a white

1527
06:48:23,750 --> 06:48:29,430
lotus flower that grows where the water pools deeply it appears that's the most expensive

1528
06:48:29,430 --> 06:48:32,630
magic card it's worth like seventy five thousand dollars

1529
06:48:32,630 --> 06:48:40,310
fountainhead waters pooled deeply white lotus cards in a deep valley yes indeed the sunken valley

1530
06:48:40,310 --> 06:48:46,549
may be the place the fountainhead water should flow into there where is this sunken valley it's

1531
06:48:46,549 --> 06:48:52,869
beyond the woods to the rear of the castle there's a shrine dedicated to the white serpent deep in

1532
06:48:52,869 --> 06:49:00,069
the woods as the name implies the sunken valley is just below that place there's no proper path

1533
06:49:00,069 --> 06:49:05,270
down there but a man of your talent do you prefer water with or without pulp

1534
06:49:09,400 --> 06:49:14,919
I really hate to tell you this but if you're drinking water with pulp that's like lead you're

1535
06:49:14,919 --> 06:49:18,599
drinking fucking all kinds of messed up like copper and minerals and shit I don't know if

1536
06:49:18,599 --> 06:49:29,369
you should drink like metal I'm gonna say without they did the smell was reminiscent of sawdust

1537
06:49:29,369 --> 06:49:37,049
but also it smelled faintly of sakura flowers oh so you smelled it too I felt the scent was much

1538
06:49:37,049 --> 06:49:49,450
crunchy water but slightly different what is it wolf that scent it reminds me of something you

1539
06:49:49,450 --> 06:49:53,689
smelled it before are you gonna turn on the japanese voices are you gonna make us suffer

1540
06:49:53,689 --> 06:50:02,650
this shit it's fine what's wrong with it it's just like it's voice acting what's wrong with it

1541
06:50:10,759 --> 06:50:22,200
my goodness so little do you know kid and everybody that I've talked to in the game

1542
06:50:23,419 --> 06:50:45,159
over the last 15 to 20 minutes I I have another rez really holy shit okay that's pretty cool

1543
06:50:46,040 --> 06:50:55,849
shadows die three times now uh what was I saying right um I already have the sunken temple ready

1544
06:50:55,849 --> 06:51:00,650
to go it's like I'm ready to do it right now I don't have to traverse anything I've already

1545
06:51:00,650 --> 06:51:19,500
explored down there already take a look at that oh what's that made it how did he get down

1546
06:51:19,500 --> 06:51:31,139
here so quickly all right now pop there was I went this which was the right way this way takes me to

1547
06:51:33,319 --> 06:51:39,299
no that's not the right way it said something about snipers so I have good thing I have that

1548
06:51:39,299 --> 06:52:07,209
hat to protect from snipers hey can I just keep this on forever hmm very interesting stuff

1549
06:52:07,209 --> 06:52:21,659
I could keep going or I could go this way looks like certain death is it though yeah what's this

1550
06:52:21,659 --> 06:52:44,380
here for no wait can I make that jump there's a guy down here they're the most elite snipers

1551
06:52:44,380 --> 06:52:59,619
in in the entire world oh a sniper looks like a can of tuna on top of a broomstick I think I'm

1552
06:52:59,619 --> 06:53:10,330
gonna be fine I always get the hardest items to get in this game that are in the weirdest place

1553
06:53:10,330 --> 06:53:29,849
are always the vases they're just the ceramic shards anymore I think I have to get down eventually

1554
06:53:30,729 --> 06:54:04,619
I'm going this way this is where I was I was spoke okay hey I mean I could probably use a

1555
06:54:05,180 --> 06:54:11,240
like a slice of pizza right now all right somebody name food name like a food and I'll eat it tonight

1556
06:54:12,040 --> 06:54:21,959
not on stream but you know a little bit when I go eat burger sushi a burrito uh ass cool

1557
06:54:22,599 --> 06:54:33,340
I'm talking about something I can consume for sustenance a panini that's actually sounds pretty

1558
06:54:33,340 --> 06:54:51,110
good it's a good call uh a gyro I love gyros gyro gyro gyro however you pronounce it I think it's

1559
06:54:51,110 --> 06:55:13,159

1560
06:55:18,409 --> 06:55:33,500
I just saw somebody walk over here just keep going I think I can get a kill here

1561
06:55:36,299 --> 06:55:46,569

1562
06:55:57,299 --> 06:56:18,279

1563
06:56:19,000 --> 06:56:27,340
I'm so glad nobody heard that that was purely just disgusting it was absolutely fucking

1564
06:56:28,380 --> 06:57:07,419
oh what up nice reload going when he's reloading Dr. Oakley's pizza I had one of those on stream

1565
06:57:08,060 --> 06:57:14,759
it's the only time I've really ever eaten on stream was for that all right let's take a look

1566
06:57:15,639 --> 06:57:31,049
looking for stuff materials or trinkets oh it's that guy would you have a cook on stream

1567
06:57:31,049 --> 06:57:43,509
no no not really probably not maybe as a joke or something

1568
06:57:44,150 --> 06:57:51,990
was even more formidable than we'd heard

1569
06:58:05,880 --> 06:58:21,349

1571
06:58:46,470 --> 06:58:54,090
nice shot so you probably save at least three or four streamers play this part

1572
06:58:55,369 --> 06:59:06,150
and they would probably get just what happened there I don't why I didn't why couldn't I jump to

vega for 250 frank or 250 this game is great I have a cough IRL and I blamed you for my dragon

1675
07:30:19,779 --> 07:30:26,419
rot fix it already you jerk seriously though my only complaint is AI and this game resets way too

1676
07:30:26,419 --> 07:30:29,619
easy from watching you kill his friends to being perfectly fine

1677
07:30:34,020 --> 07:30:41,220
really the only gripes that I have about sekiro are the the fact that it's a stealth game but

1678
07:30:41,220 --> 07:30:46,860
then it's also like a dark souls game too and it can be confusing sometimes because there's certain

1679
07:30:46,860 --> 07:30:51,099
sections of the game that are stealth only that essentially that you can hide in bushes and stuff

1680
07:30:51,740 --> 07:31:00,729
but thank you for the 250 just take some getting used to that's all this next one is 15 dollars

1688

1689
07:31:54,540 --> 07:32:02,569

1696
07:33:01,610 --> 07:33:05,700

bad thing for me to do but vitamin c that's what you're looking for right okay sorry this next one

1706
07:34:35,610 --> 07:34:40,569
you wanting to upload highlights to second year me rather than your main channel but is there some

1707
07:34:40,569 --> 07:34:45,209
reason that you feel you can upload videos like meet the albert since two year main they are

1708
07:34:45,209 --> 07:34:50,889
basically the bigger projects you talk oh okay cut ran out of words

1709
07:34:53,779 --> 07:34:57,700
all right but basically let me uh i'll just finish the rest of this uh it's basically the

1710
07:34:57,700 --> 07:35:01,619
bigger projects i talked about just seems like over half a million subs are going to waste so

1711
07:35:01,619 --> 07:35:05,669
i have this question you're tired of answering whatever you do you'd be the giant rat always

1712
07:35:06,229 --> 07:35:12,779
the thing about the youtube channel right is it's almost like it's on ice and it's a great

1713
07:35:12,779 --> 07:35:20,229
archive of the shit that i used to do and i've sort of transitioned and adapted over to twitch

1714
07:35:20,229 --> 07:35:26,439
and over to live content but remember i i did the youtube thing for five six years it was a long

1715
07:35:26,439 --> 07:35:33,400
time and i made a lot of videos and the reason why something like the you know meet the albertsons

1716
07:35:33,400 --> 07:35:41,529
is not on the main channel is because in my mind the original thought was i will put video gaming

1717
07:35:41,529 --> 07:35:47,770
and stream highlight stuff on the second channel and then spend a bunch of time on videos that i

1718
07:35:47,770 --> 07:35:51,610
spend like two weeks on for a week on or whatever three weeks on for the main channel and what

1719
07:35:51,610 --> 07:35:59,430
happened was i'm just one person and i ran out of i couldn't do it all it was impossible to stream

1720
07:35:59,430 --> 07:36:04,229
three or four days a week and make a video that's been two or three weeks on i wouldn't

1721
07:36:04,229 --> 07:36:07,909
streaming wouldn't happen i would have to take way more days off i'd only be able to stream like

1722
07:36:07,909 --> 07:36:14,939
once or twice a week and i wanted to really give twitch a real shot so and that also was in the

1723
07:36:14,939 --> 07:36:20,419
same realm of in the same time frame of youtube really kind of shitting the bed for everybody

1724
07:36:20,419 --> 07:36:25,139
ad revenue was down content id was out of control and i just figured you know what fuck it it's i'm

1725
07:36:25,139 --> 07:36:34,169
gonna move on and the second channel really exists to have a place for people that don't want to or

1726
07:36:34,169 --> 07:36:42,470
can't watch entire streams they're still able to stick around and and watch videos and of the

1727
07:36:42,470 --> 07:36:48,740
the jokes and the streams that happen still you know that's the that's kind of the point of that

1728
07:36:48,740 --> 07:36:53,540
second channel is to have a means for other people that can maybe not i mean this stream has been

1729
07:36:53,540 --> 07:36:59,770
going on for almost eight hours and a video that's 10 to 20 minutes is much easier for a lot of people

1730
07:36:59,770 --> 07:37:09,000
to consume and still get the gist of kind of a lot of things that may have happened right but i never

1731
07:37:09,000 --> 07:37:13,849
wanted to abandon the youtube channel there was never the point it was always just and i mean you

1732
07:37:13,849 --> 07:37:21,830
saw starve tweeted about this a week ago or so it's for the type of content that i want to make on

1733
07:37:21,830 --> 07:37:28,069
youtube it's not it's just not viable to do anymore the the amount of time it takes versus

1734
07:37:28,069 --> 07:37:41,099
what you get out of it is it's just hard to do now and hold on and unfortunately unless you have

1735
07:37:41,099 --> 07:37:44,380
like a big sponsorship or you have like a patreon which is another thing that floated but then i

1736
07:37:44,380 --> 07:37:48,439
thought about it again it's like there are thousands of subs on this channel and like

1737
07:37:48,439 --> 07:37:55,860
there's already a patreon it already kind of exists and it's people paying a month on here

1738
07:37:55,860 --> 07:37:59,860
you know it's hey i'm gonna pay you a patreon once a month and oh by the way i'm also gonna

1739
07:37:59,860 --> 07:38:05,450
be subscribed on twitch too it feels like double dipping people and you know i don't wanna i don't

1740
07:38:05,450 --> 07:38:10,250
want to have like three different income revenues to try and bleed everybody dry because i want to

1741
07:38:10,250 --> 07:38:16,700
make a youtube video tomorrow you know this people are you guys already pay me to make content which

1742
07:38:16,700 --> 07:38:22,150
is the streams right and i guess it is possible to do another patreon but i feel like you guys

1743
07:38:22,150 --> 07:38:28,729
already pay you guys already pay the fee in quotes why would i want to make you guys like

1744
07:38:28,729 --> 07:38:36,860
pay again oh yeah people pay five dollars a month give me five dollars a month too and i don't even

1745
07:38:36,860 --> 07:38:40,700
want to look at it like a fee to you know watch the content i want the content to always be free

1746
07:38:40,700 --> 07:38:45,099
always accessible always people that you don't have to pay them any money to hang out here and

1747
07:38:45,099 --> 07:38:54,099
watch right and that's i never want that but streams started to take that the time that i was

1748
07:38:54,099 --> 07:38:58,259
going to put into stuff on youtube turned into stuff that i put a bunch of time on and twitch

1749
07:38:58,650 --> 07:39:03,939
and i've done it a few times already this year and even last year and once the summertime rolls

1750
07:39:03,939 --> 07:39:08,439
around you're gonna see a lot more of that oh in studio we're gonna be in the studio this week and

1751
07:39:08,439 --> 07:39:12,599
we're doing something interesting you know the weather's starting to get nicer there's more

1752
07:39:12,599 --> 07:39:19,029
opportunities to do stuff and you'll be seeing a lot of that in the summer so the time and energy

1753
07:39:19,029 --> 07:39:27,020
and resources and money that was going to go into the main youtube channel is just here now hopefully

1754
07:39:27,020 --> 07:39:35,750
that makes sense but really appreciate it thank you and the main channel at this point i'm only

1755
07:39:36,229 --> 07:39:42,840
rather even probably call it like the the archive channel because it would have to take some there

1756
07:39:42,840 --> 07:39:48,340
would have to be some reason why i would go back and make another video that i spend like a two like

1757
07:39:48,340 --> 07:39:57,419
a week or two on voices sounding a little better now yeah it's starting to even out but it still

1758
07:39:58,220 --> 07:40:05,000
still sounds like shit and it's like barely at that point where it's it might fall back into

1759
07:40:05,000 --> 07:40:17,959
joan rivers but we're good uh all right fuck this text of speech i'm fine thank you sly 161 for the

1767
07:40:57,430 --> 07:41:03,779

1768
07:41:03,779 --> 07:41:15,299
really not that hard that's not that hard thank you door cube for the 250 i know this game has

1769
07:41:15,299 --> 07:41:19,540
made you mad but holy hell some of these noises you made while fighting the long swordsman made

1770
07:41:19,540 --> 07:41:25,540
me bust a gut so bad that's just the nature of the game though i love this game don't take my

1771
07:41:25,619 --> 07:41:32,659
frustration and anger and shit talking as i don't like what i'm doing i love this game it's great

1772
07:41:32,659 --> 07:41:40,979
it's fantastic it's so fucking hard it's so different so yeah it's refreshing to lose over

1773
07:41:40,979 --> 07:41:44,979
and over again and not be able to fall back on the shit that used to do in their other games

1774

swing but i will keep my final assessment of the game until i get further or i beat it right that's

1777
07:42:11,659 --> 07:42:17,240
how everybody played yeah now you can't do that anymore you have to block you have to parry you

1778
07:42:17,240 --> 07:42:24,700
have to dodge certain attacks and it changes everything it throws your brain into it snowballs

1779
07:42:24,700 --> 07:42:30,970
it down until the snowball is huge and then you die three times music commuted oh shit right

1780
07:42:31,930 --> 07:42:38,979
thanks for that uh callee brady thanks for the 25 dollars callee brady 25 bucks hey germa glad to

1781
07:42:38,979 --> 07:42:45,080
see you enjoying sekiro sekiro uh i've never had the patience for soulsborne games so i have to

1782
07:42:45,080 --> 07:42:52,900
enjoy you through it keep the fun coming for sure i'm going to try my hardest to complete the game

1783
07:42:52,900 --> 07:42:58,250
on stream that's exactly what we're going to be doing when i come back the day after tomorrow

1784
07:42:58,250 --> 07:43:07,669
thank you smelly boy thanks for the 250 it's probably hard for you to register when you're

1785
07:43:07,669 --> 07:43:13,110
focused on playing it but the combat in this game is genuinely entertaining to watch a lot of dark

1786
07:43:13,110 --> 07:43:17,990
souls combat is pretty basic with the repetitive dodge roll and attack literally what we were just

1787
07:43:17,990 --> 07:43:25,110
talking about but watching you play this genuinely is genuinely beautiful at times yeah i'm trying to

1788
07:43:25,110 --> 07:43:32,630
because for me i'm just trying to time parries and not get hit by moves and dodge but i imagine

1789
07:43:32,630 --> 07:43:37,110
from a viewer's standpoint it actually looks pretty cool when you land two or three good

1790
07:43:37,110 --> 07:43:45,130
parries and a dodge and then a reversal probably looks cool it feels really good to play too it's

1791
07:43:45,130 --> 07:43:51,209
not sloppy the camera is really but that's a complaint for every from software game but a

1792
07:43:51,209 --> 07:43:56,250
game that's this fast and is visceral that's i remember i told you about like my two gripes

1793
07:43:56,250 --> 07:44:01,860
with the game and one is the camera because sometimes it really is just spins in circles

1794
07:44:01,860 --> 07:44:09,430
and gets locked somewhere but that's pretty much it it's a pretty minor complaint like i was telling

1795
07:44:09,430 --> 07:44:17,659
you i think it's great you the thing is you can get over that really quickly it's not something

1796
07:44:17,659 --> 07:44:29,049
that's a game breaker but thank you smelly boy uh thank you mango's evo wins for the ten dollars

1797

all over the place the butterfly lady was cool was interesting too that's me that'd be hard to

1847
