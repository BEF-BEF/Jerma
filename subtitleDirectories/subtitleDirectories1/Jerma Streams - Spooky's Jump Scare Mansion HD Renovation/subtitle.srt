1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:17,670
Hey, too early? That's right. I've got to be better at this stream starting soon screen,

2
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,420
I think. Because here's the thing, I feel like when I sit here and I'm ready to start streaming,

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:35,320
I press this turn on stream button, start streaming, and then I'm ready to stream.

4
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,219
So I feel like I should just press that button and then like go get... but I'm here. I'm ready.

5
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:49,340
It's kind of an awkward situation where I press the button and I'm just sitting here just looking

6
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:57,609
at chat waiting to unmute. And like should I do it now? Should I do it in like two minutes?

7
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:05,500
I guess take a sip of my water. There's a maybe a handful of scenarios where that screen's been on

8
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:14,739
and I've had to go to the bathroom quick. Some streamers do a full 10 to 20 minutes of a starting

9
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:23,849
soon screen. I've seen like five minutes starting soons, 10 minute, 20 minute. I feel like that's

10
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:49,909
too much for me. Some do 50 minutes. An hour? A full hour? Holy shit. I guess it makes sense

11
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:56,650
for people that stream very long on Twitch. I guess if you press the start streaming button

12
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:03,659
and you stream for like 12 hours, it's not that big of a deal. And there's another argument there

13
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:11,770
where, well, most people don't even come to the stream until 30, 40 plus minutes have gone by.

14
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:19,750
So I guess it makes sense. Some people are just hopping in on notifications after 10, 20 minutes.

15
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,460
I guess it makes sense. But my attention span, if I press the start streaming button... I don't know.

16
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:43,419
I'm concerned. If I press the start... I just got burped murdered is what happened. Somebody just

17
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:49,050
came up behind me and murdered me and burped at the same time. God. All right. Anyways.

18
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:57,659
So anyways, what was I saying? Right. I would be afraid that if I had my stream just going

19
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:04,780
on my computer up here for like 35, 40 straight minutes, me internally would always think that

20
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,479
is a mic on? What if they hear me like singing in the shower? What if they hear me blowing my nose?

21
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:22,780
What if I... There's a lot of mic unmuted scenarios that could happen there. But no, usually I usually

22
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:34,360
do about two or three minutes and then about five minutes total until we do it like that.

23
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:42,300
So today we're going to do Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion HD remake HD renovation.

24
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,110
The reason why we're doing this instead of Darkwood is I just want to break it up a little

25
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:56,650
because I want to play more Darkwood, but I don't want to play Darkwood like three days in a row.

26
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,770
I'd rather do this first and however long if this takes five, six, seven hours, then whatever.

27
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:08,379
We will go back to Darkwood tomorrow. But if this is like three hours or less, if this is only a

28
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:14,939
couple hours, I've heard this can range between like two and six hours. So whatever the case is,

29
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:23,689
we're streaming tomorrow too. We'll see. It has this music that's just playing.

30
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:31,500
This is a very highly requested game. I got this request a bunch of times and if I don't like the

31
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,660
game, then I'm just gonna play Darkwood. If the game is short, I'm gonna play Darkwood.

32
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:43,000
Gonna play Darkwood tomorrow. So we'll see more Darkwood. I 100% guarantee if there's no Darkwood

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,160
tomorrow, then actually I can't say this. What if I like break my leg? Okay, so if I stream...

34
00:04:51,160 --> 00:05:01,339
Never mind. I'm ready. This is Darkwood. It's not Darkwood. This is Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.

35
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,189
I don't know much about this game. All I know about this game is that

36
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,750
I don't want to play endless mode. You have to go through a bunch of rooms and they all jump scare.

37
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,470
So by the way, I need to make this very clear. This game is going to flash you. It's going to

38
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,629
make loud noises. It's going to scream and it's going to flash the screen and shit. So just be

39
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:24,860
aware of that. Be careful. Okay, the mansion. Renovator version of the original. Why don't

40
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,980
I just do that one? Unlock the secrets of the strange hospital. Build your own mansion. All

41
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:39,740
right. We're going to just do the regular one. The one that... This one. Is this part of the game?

42
00:05:40,459 --> 00:06:03,860
Do I actually like fight the controller? Okay. So, uh, welcome. We're in room zero.

43
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:21,610
Is there a punch? First jump scare. Okay. I have to do a thousand of these.

44
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:45,060
I gotta turn it up. This is too quiet. Yeah, I... Jump scare is on. What if I turn them off?

45
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:54,089
What's the point of playing the game? I'm going to play Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.

46
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:02,569
But, like, story mode. It's just baby mode. Put it at 69. No. I'll do 50 where it should be.

47
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,290
This is... I turned off motion blur. I would... I had to tell you about that, too, because that's

48
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:16,149
fucked up. Uh, apply. Better. No, it's louder for you now. I'm turning it down. All right, let's go.

49
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:25,480
Uh, Jump Scare Mansion. Turn the DPI down on my mouse, please. Is there a DPI button? Input. Mouse.

50
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:53,990
UI. No. In game. Where's my DPI reducer? I missed it. It was there. In game. Oh, it's...

51
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:08,470
Look down. 1.0. Okay, I'm gonna... I... You do eight. No, seven. Let's see if that's better.

52
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,939
Yeah, that feels better. All right, let's go. So, um, this is Jump Scare Mansion. I'm going to assume

53
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:28,170
that every single room screams at you. Is that for real? Because, I mean, I'm... I know that's

54
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:37,820
gonna happen now. I know that somebody's gonna scream in my face, right here. You've kind of

55
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:49,830
given away the whole point of the game. Is this it? What'd it say? At first, this place just seemed

56
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,950
cute, but I've been here for days now. Feeling quite parched now, and I keep getting this feeling

57
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:08,820
like I'm being watched by something. This is not romantic at all. It's Jump Scare Mansion. Thank

58
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:17,909
God I only had one coffee today. But that's the thing. If you know it's gonna happen, how do they

59
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:31,000
get you when you... Okay, pumpkin's in the walls. Person in the ceiling. Something outside? No. It's

60
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:42,970
a cloud. Can I open... draw? Something's gonna come out of the... draw. No. That's nothing in here.

61
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,259
I've been playing too much Darkwood, which, by the way, it's coming back soon. In a day or so.

62
00:09:48,259 --> 00:10:18,409
What's that? This is a puzzle game. I have two ways to go now. Uh, left or right door? Is this...

63
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:32,570
Is this a bigger room? Oh, okay. Pick the middle one. I got the bad end. Choices matter. Is that...

64
00:10:32,570 --> 00:11:01,029
Are you kidding? Or is that real? All right, I'm almost, um, 1% of the way there. Right? This game

65
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,669
takes four hours to beat. I guess that makes sense. You just have to walk through a thousand rooms.

66
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:14,250
All right, I'm gonna go... I went left before. I'm gonna go right now. What's... I have a health bar.

67
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:29,879
What's the energy bar for? For the Jump Scare Mansion, you've got one jump scare in 13 rooms,

68
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:39,909
and it was pumpkin. Can I go back through the other door? No. There's got to be another

69
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:46,149
jump scare coming up. Was it every, like, 20 rooms? Every... Yep, there it is. Here he is.

70
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:52,870
I know something is following me, but I feel like I'm prancing through the same rooms over and over.

71
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,669
Right? Hopefully leaving notes as breadcrumbs will prove I'm making progress in reaching some

72
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:08,580
destination. I just hope I don't run out of ink. I'm dreadfully thirsty. This is me leaving these

73
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:17,129
notes because I'm stuck in a time loop. Pumpkin scared him more. Yep, because pumpkin made a

74
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:49,460
noise. It made a loud, like... The skeleton just showed up. Oh, maze time. Okay. 18. Holy shit,

75
00:12:49,460 --> 00:13:00,710
that's a sprint. You can sprint, and it goes too fast. I'm not using the sprint. There's a lot of

76
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:13,049
doors here. This one. Bed. Are there items? I don't think so. I think I get it. I think you

77
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:27,750
just keep going. It only happens twice. Wasn't I in this room before? Oh, please don't tell me

78
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,590
this is one of these games where you have to... It's like a maze, and you have to figure out the

79
00:13:31,590 --> 00:14:06,169
maze. I went in the left door last time. Or... Am I going... What's wrong with my neck? Somebody just

80
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:25,820
said neck. Your neck. Your neck. What's wrong with it? I think I'm doing something wrong. Yep, I have

81
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:31,259
ink. Not quite quenching my thirst. Taste is terrible. Stains are terrible. I don't think

82
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:37,320
drinking it was a very romantic idea. Why is everything romantic? I am leaving these notes

83
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,179
because I remember the little skeleton body here. He's gonna jump up right now. No? Okay.

84
00:14:45,620 --> 00:15:10,200
It's gonna happen like a hundred more times because it doesn't matter if something's scary

85
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
or not, or if you know it's gonna happen. If somebody just jumps in front of you and yells,

86
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:21,259
you're gonna be like, oh! See? I know they're happening, but it doesn't matter. It's a

87
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:31,610
startling thing. It looks like they've increased the frequency of these. You can always tell when

88
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,809
I really actually get scared by something. We talked about this yesterday during Darkwood, but

89
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:41,370
if my hand comes up and I start to play the guitar in the air, that means that's a real reaction.

90
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:55,850
Any other time, if I'm like, whoa! No, that's bullshit. Bullshit. I start playing an invisible

91
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:29,240
flute. Oh, yeah. Terrified. I've only done 36 of these. It's the constant running that I think

92
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:52,889
gets you because your brain is going forward and then it... What's that? I found something today

93
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:58,730
to satisfy my unromantic thirst. I woke today from a brief faint and found before me a bottle

94
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:05,509
of red wine. This is me. I'm not sure what brand or year, but there is no label. All I gather is

95
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:24,710
that it tastes strongly metallic. Okay. I'm gonna pre yell too. I think that'll help too. If my body

96
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,190
is ready and I'm like tensed already, if I scream beforehand, I won't scream at the actual jump

97
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:46,789
scare. I think it works. People are gonna think I'm fucking crazy.

98
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:30,500
I need to test my hypothesis. You have to exhale too. No inhale. Exhale. Because then you can't go...

99
00:18:34,819 --> 00:19:03,799
I'm just gonna do pregnancy classes. Locked. Okay. Keep a little pep in your step.

100
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:17,849
I'm just waiting for everything to do it. You can do it. We can help. Papa John's. Papa John's

101
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:36,180
sucks, by the way. Oh, it's a save point. All right. It does not. I mean, it does. It's not

102
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:49,960
very good. Papa Gino is way better than Papa John's. Like a thousand times better. Those of you

103
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,319
that don't know Papa Gino's, you don't know the true meaning of like chain pizza. It's because

104
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:08,140
his name is Gino. No, that's not why. I mean, that helps. It's not the reason. Can I crouch?

105
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:55,130
Okay. 51. We're almost 5.1% of the way there. You are here. Where? I think that's the point.

106
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:09,900
This is a good map. Sounds like something's at the end of this hall.

107
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:26,359
This is why I can't do these games. And you wonder, whoa, where's Scare Saturdays? Scare

108
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:32,230
Saturdays used to hurt me. That's why every Saturday I would just be like, I have to do

109
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,109
another one of these and I don't want to do it. But it was Saturday. So I had to do it because I

110
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:43,109
said, I'm going to Scare Saturdays every Saturday. After doing that for like four or five, six weeks

111
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:53,339
in a row, I was like, I, it's Friday and how do I not do this on Saturday? I thought it was fun for

112
00:21:53,339 --> 00:22:06,809
like eight weeks in a row. He hates streaming. No. What does it have to do with streaming?

113
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:15,109
That has nothing to do with live streaming. It's scary jump in your face games. They make me ill.

114
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:27,299
That's like saying, oh, that chef really doesn't like stabbing himself in the chest with his

115
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:55,460
kitchen knife. He must hate, he hates cooking. He hates cooking. He hates, he hates streaming.

116
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:09,750
Slime. It's going to pop up. Or it's that, this is a red herring. This is a, this is a red herring.

117
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:18,660
It's going to come over here. Yep. This is a red herring. Spouting, splashing, soaking, innards,

118
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:27,930
ingest, invoking, nailing never stops the choking. I told you, I told you it was going to get up.

119
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:37,109
Uh, this health in the game, they have a health bar. Wait, they all get up. Wait,

120
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:47,819
they, he's following me around in every room. No, he's not. Please, please. You think I'm going

121
00:23:47,819 --> 00:24:10,599
to pay attention to the little ghost? He is chasing me through every room. There's no jump. Oh, good

122
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:42,380
thing I didn't go to the chair route. I'm good. How long does this last for? This is not just for

123
00:24:42,380 --> 00:25:07,529
the rest of the game, right? Another, another, like, like 932 floors of this. Hey, I can't go

124
00:25:07,529 --> 00:26:10,789
in that door. I think I'm safe. Okay. I got it. Fucking dot on me. He's taking poison damage.

125
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:27,990
I can hate this. I don't, it doesn't matter. I, there's a thousand of these rooms. Why would

126
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:39,420
I do this? Of like the four to 5,000 of you that requested this. It was, it was actually like six

127
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:56,140
people, but still. Wait for that to recharge. Seven. He just really doesn't. He just hates

128
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:08,329
streaming. He doesn't want, he hates streaming. It's like, I think that's like my favorite comment.

129
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:28,069
It'll last like a week. Almost 10% of the way there. It's been 30 minutes. So that's a hundred

130
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:41,670
rooms in 30 minutes, which means that's 10%. So three, six, nine, 12, 14, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30.

131
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:48,950
This is going to take three hours. That was the easiest math problem ever. And I made that so

132
00:27:48,950 --> 00:28:10,809
much more complicated for no reason. Oh, there's another one of these guys. This is how many? Two?

133
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:20,009
All right. Just stay ahead of them. Here comes, we're going to be one in the hallway here. It's

134
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:58,390
going to be like boom. Almost at a hundred. Ninety-five. Floor a hundred. 10% of the way

135
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:06,380
there. Keep that blood pumping. I'm actually all right. So I've completed 10% of the game.

136
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:25,049
This is your breather. Every 50 rooms. I saved it, right? Yeah. This is going to take you five

137
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:31,849
hours. Why would it take me five hours? I just have to go into different halls and open doors

138
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:39,829
900 more times. So there are only 60 minutes in an hour. So one room per minute. No, it's one.

139
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:54,119
No, that's not how it works. Why would I spend one minute in each room? What happened to the

140
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:05,259
little ghost person at the beginning? It was just like, hi, welcome to my castle. And then they've

141
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:43,720
gone. New environment. It's beige now. Cat dos. What do you mean cat dos? Should I enter cat dos?

142
00:30:47,720 --> 00:31:06,089
Press it. Enter cat dos. Access specimen database. Modify house layout. Specimen one. Cat dos. Type

143
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:11,609
docile. Total fatalities four from heart attack. Cardboard cutout figure that springs out from the

144
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:24,680
walls. Prove not very effective against healthy subjects. Cat dos two. Active. 137 fatalities.

145
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:31,579
Method physical tearing. A mostly semi-solid base specter that frequently changes matter states.

146
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:41,930
Prove very effective against weaker or slower subjects. What was spoiler three? Hidden testing.

147
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:48,710
43 infectious bites. A test specimen being developed at GL labs should prove useful when

148
00:31:48,710 --> 00:32:00,500
released. Trials have shown it is adequately effective to average subjects. Method consumption.

149
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:07,210
A 14th century spirit that was contained and relocated here. Tests have yet to reveal origins,

150
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:12,220
but all relevant information has been placed into testing chamber. Proved effective, but not

151
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:21,799
greatly more than previous specimens. A creature found inside the church of a small town. Subjects

152
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:31,210
are lost after contact with the specimen. The bloodbath of killing is unknown. Proved extremely

153
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:43,420
effective against subjects with mental issues or weak wills. All right. Modify house layout error.

154
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:58,150
Exit program. And one of these is going to be in the room. Not in this room. There's going to be

155
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:19,500
all kind of this. There's going to be five different cat doses. Is this one of the cat doses? Bang! Up

156
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:26,619
against the wall. Yep. No, come on. Do it like sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint. What's that in

157
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:29,740
the distance? Sprint, sprint, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, and then wicked

158
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:57,210
close. But wait, are these are these YouTubers that have been scared by the game? All right.

159
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:06,539
That's, that's so funny. Why am I not on that wall? I, because I've not, I haven't played this game.

160
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:33,829
I had nothing to do with this game. What do you mean you're next? No, I'm not. We are almost,

161
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:53,590
we are almost 11% of the way through this game. Green room. Music's getting louder.

162
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,860
Green room two. Something coming up out of the water. No, something coming up on the left side.

163
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,539
It's going to be here. It's going to be in here. I mean, you don't have the fog. Well,

164
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:34,780
that was the door. I know what you're going to do. Just do it already. Ding, ding. What do you mean

165
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:53,400
ding? Ding, donk, donk, donk, ding. So it was right, left, right, right. That's a double ding.

166
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:35,079
Straight, right, right, right, right, ding. One and fifteen. Music's getting louder.

167
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,780
I thought they got rid of these because they were more effective. These are more effective

168
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:49,639
than the monsters. Look at my reactions I had to the green I'm going to kill you monster versus

169
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:57,739
the paper cutout that's like an emoji sticker. Not this time. I don't think that was wine.

170
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:08,619
What was it? It's the test poison that you drink in it. I'm not going to just use filler words and

171
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:13,179
just use words just to talk, just be talking instead to distract myself from what's happening

172
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:19,340
on the screen. I'm not going to do that because doing that would mean that I'm trying to fill

173
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:23,420
air in my head to distract myself from the thing that's going to jump out in front of me in about

174
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:42,809
15 to 25 seconds give or take maybe a little bit there. Same thing. This is new. Needs a key card.

175
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:59,210
Please. Uh oh. I made this character in that wrestling game. That's the gum guy.

176
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,320
They're going to break out of these probably or something.

177
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:21,019
Geez. Yeah something broke out. See there's an empty one. Okay PG YouTuber activated. Oh crap.

178
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:40,920
Oh no. Oh oh goodness. What the heck happened? Blood. Subject five is growing more and more

179
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,840
restless. I told Spook we need more funds for sedatives but she just laughed and flew into the

180
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,320
ceiling without more chemicals to keep these things docile. I'm not sure how much longer

181
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,079
we can keep them here. Got the key card. Subject five is growing more and more restless. I told

182
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:10,179
Spook we need more and more sedatives okay. He does this joke every game. I got it. I gotta keep

183
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:26,019
it going you know what I mean. It's tradition at this point. Look behind you in real life. Well not

184
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:30,659
every game. Only games where I have a facecam on. All right I'll give you that. If I have a facecam

185
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:38,099
turned on I'm going to do the YouTube person with 400 episodes. Yeah that's what happens.

186
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:42,179
You have to deal with it for like the two or three minutes that I do it out of like 12 hours.

187
00:39:42,820 --> 00:40:01,960
Come on. I believe subject five is loose. The glass around its container is shattered and I

188
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,280
can faintly hear clicking coming from the ceiling. I don't know what will happen now but it's out

189
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:16,699
and alive. This is probably my last report. The clicking is getting louder now. It's behind me.

190
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:22,869
I want to see what it looks like. Oh there's a bug.

191
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,250
That was pretty funny. All right they come out of these the clicker ceilings.

192
00:40:41,050 --> 00:41:08,500
He's fast. He just keeps breaking the doors. Great. Oh great. Oh great. Oh great. Oh no. Oh crap.

193
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:40,460
There's like a hundred of them. Oh no. Oh jeez. Oh crap. I do that every fucking stream too.

194
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:52,340
I gotta get the fuck out of here. I know it's behind me. Just don't even look at it. This is

195
00:41:52,340 --> 00:42:06,550
a good way to burn through rooms though. It's the same exact room. You do it too early. You missed

196
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:33,030
your cue. 150, 150, 150. So I can stop this mute of these. Is he here still? Get the gunk out of

197
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:40,889
your ears. What implying that I didn't hear you say something? That's what you say to somebody

198
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:46,119
that's not listening to you. You're talking to somebody and they're not paying attention.

199
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,960
Hey what time is the bus? What time are we going? What time are we getting on the bus?

200
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:55,400
Hey get the gunk out of your ears. And they're like whoa what the heck? What are you talking

201
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:24,949
about? Really dry lips. Will you pay attention to the game please? Saved it. Hang in there. We're

202
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:29,670
only at 15 percent. What do you want me to click while I have a second here? Look at the link.

203
00:43:29,670 --> 00:44:15,590
Click this link. That's pretty. Okay that's pretty fun. But I wasn't playing a scary game there.

204
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:26,980
150 let's go. That wasn't me playing a scary game. That was me putting tape all over my body

205
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:47,449
without a scary game. Get scared or riot. Chop till you drop axe. What was the image? I missed it.

206
00:44:50,619 --> 00:45:05,880
Well you missed it. Sorry. All right let's go. I'm speed running my way to one uh for 200.

207
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:15,880
Now this is different. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. I'll do it. I'll get to a thousand.

208
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,820
They're gonna introduce more monsters. There's gonna be one in the ceiling. There'll be one in

209
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:38,019
the rafters. There'll be one coming out of the wall. Oh shit. What the hell is this? He's still

210
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:51,690
behind me isn't he? You take 160 floors to introduce the flashlight mechanic. Oh shit. This is like a

211
00:45:51,690 --> 00:46:03,539
classroom read. Read the notes. Something's gonna be at a desk. I can't get out of here. Something's

212
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:24,550
gonna be at a desk. What is in the desk? A key card. Something. There's nothing in here. I just

213
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:38,409
rewound a YouTube video. I didn't want to miss my favorite part. Okay there's a note here.

214
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:54,840
Matsuri never came to class today. Oh she made it home. Okay. Hey what Harry? What? I looked at a

215
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:14,070
picture of a cat. It hurt me. That's great. Cool. Could really be true. I thought the fairy tales

216
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:19,269
about the ghost that eats children who sneak in after class was just to keep us from disobeying

217
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:39,030
but Matsuri is still missing. But where's the key to get out of here? I'm lost. There's a shadow over

218
00:47:39,030 --> 00:48:07,030
there. Somebody in the corner. I see them. Is that me? What? That just hurt me. Okay I need to start

219
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:13,530
paying it to get some logical reasoning here. Which way am I going? This is back towards the

220
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:28,579
front. So it's here and then bang a left. Then bang a right. Out the door. Thank you. All right.

221
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:48,119
Okay. All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

222
00:48:49,719 --> 00:49:09,340
Three. Oh Undertale. Oh shit it's actually flying at me.

223
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:37,820
You are you bad at your cue. You missed your cue again. Shut up. Thank you.

224
00:49:52,820 --> 00:50:10,940
This is how this music's too happy. I don't know how much longer I can go on. I haven't seen

225
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,260
any of my previous notes. That means either I'm getting somewhere or someone is taking them.

226
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:48,170
Chair. Don't go chair route. I've already got this taken care of. This way. Damn it. Wait. No.

227
00:50:49,340 --> 00:51:01,719
Nothing. You got it taken chair of. I wish I came up with that but I didn't. Nice work.

228
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:22,199
I hear breathing. I'm not even at floor 200. Fucking idiot. I think this. I think this is

229
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:27,239
my last note. I'm going to die having never found my escape but really that's not true. This place

230
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:31,480
was like my escape. My escape from everything else in the end. My death is kind of romantic.

231
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:59,719
This romantic thing has really got me all twisted. This is a live stream twisted. So now I can read

232
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:05,639
chat for a second. What's up? This is romantic. How's that iced coffee? Oh it's not iced coffee.

233
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:13,079
This is water that I sprayed a little bit of lime lemon juice in. This is just to stay hydrated.

234
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:33,130
Bugs. It is water. Get this wrong. Okay. Chair. Which is the right... I didn't see it.

235
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:45,429
Going as fast as I can. Get out of here. Yeah. I know we're both playing Gmod Deathrun and I'm

236
00:52:45,429 --> 00:53:10,519
going too slow for you but fuck off. I'm trying to enjoy the game. Nice. I almost hit 200.

237
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:27,530
200. What was that? This thing's looking at me. I'm not gonna say it. No. I'm not gonna say it.

238
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:33,639
Somebody else did. I refuse to say it. All right. So how's everybody doing? How's your day?

239
00:53:34,440 --> 00:54:06,460
Make your face came bigger. Wow. That's not necessary. There you go. There you go.

240
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:50,150
200. Make it bigger. No. That's as big as it's gonna get. 204. Yeah. Any chance I can get to throw

241
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:57,340
that in? You better believe I'm gonna. Uh oh. This is like Slender Man graphic on me.

242
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:13,000
Why do I have like the Slender static? What? This is... This was such a surprise that there would

243
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,719
be another entry. Another actual entry. One I could admire but then as suddenly as it came it left

244
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:36,599
and now you disband. Your influence and inspiration will never leave me. Such a surprise.

245
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:50,980
Is that code for how I have to? Oh my fucking jaw hurts.

246
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:05,849
So that's what that means. Okay. That... It took 208 rooms. That was a real one for me.

247
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:18,179
It took 200 rooms to have that be a full-on... Like I was not ready for that one. Jumpscare mansion.

248
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:42,230
Oh fuck. Don't even... What's this? Hey. The darkness is slowly consuming us now. I don't

249
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:47,269
think our rituals will appease it much longer. How were we supposed to know this would happen?

250
00:56:51,860 --> 00:57:04,949
Ah shit. Ah shit. It's not really our fault. We just did what mother has told us to do in

251
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:25,420
this sort of situation. Mother is not pleased with us but how were we supposed to know that

252
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:40,119
that girl wasn't pure? He's reading lore in the game. Yeah. I kind of want to know what's going on.

253
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:44,119
It's not really our fault. We did what mother told us to do.

254
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:53,639
This is probably... One of these is going to have somebody in it. The girl wasn't pure.

255
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:06,099
Ah. That's where I came from. If I cross my eyes like it won't be scary because I won't know what

256
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:54,250
it is. Except that hurts. Did it work? Kind of works. Safety squinting. What the fuck is happening

257
00:58:54,250 --> 00:59:01,340
to you? All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Give me the 220.

258
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,940
Two... There's somebody... There's something following me. I don't know what it is.

259
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:14,380
I just want to see what it looks like. It's got a knife. But when it sees you it changes

260
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:36,389
your environment to be all fucky. Oh no. This is not good. Get out of my way. I... You are

261
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:49,960
meaningless to me now. I have to be honest. When I crossed my eyes like that for more than 10 seconds

262
00:59:49,960 --> 01:00:04,570
I just... I... This hurts. My head hurts now. Oh nice. Arcade games. How do you control it?

263
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:24,090
It's gonna scream in my face. Oh I'm here. Wait. I have to... I'm the ghost. Hey! That's not very

264
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:48,840
nice. I can't believe Pac-Man is fucking dead. Wait. No. I'm the... Oh. I'm the ghost. Where...

265
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:55,289
Why am I doing this? I didn't even stab anybody.

266
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:12,170
Automatic plus letter grid. Now technically speaking I'm not driving the car. My character

267
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:22,760
is. This is a... This is a pretty good song. I'll give it a half letter grade for that.

268
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:35,610
Fucking... What are these people doing? Why are people just spinning around on the road?

269
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:54,250
What? What do... Oh. I'm... Okay. It's a big turn. Oh. I can run over stuff.

270
01:01:55,769 --> 01:02:09,989
This is a good song. Here comes a demon face. Yeah. I know. I'm certain of it. That's why

271
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:36,969
I'm getting ready. How do I win? Here's the sad part about this. This is a better game

272
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:55,159
than any of the iPad GTA clones I played like five years ago. Do I have to eliminate all the

273
01:02:55,159 --> 01:03:18,579
other cars? Alright. That's it. I win. I haven't... I didn't win. Checkpoint. Nitrous. How do I

274
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:30,340
activate nitrous? Every time I destroy a car my point... I... My time goes up. Just don't...

275
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:55,219
Don't kill any... Don't stop killing anybody. What? There's nobody else here. That was fun.

276
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:10,139
I can't leave the game. There's no exit. I can't walk this way. I'm driving the car backwards.

277
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:27,429
I'm holding the... I'm holding it like this. It's doing a Naruto run. Alright. 15 seconds.

278
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:49,610
Here it comes. It's gonna go... I just got achievement. It says meta gamer. This one's

279
01:04:49,610 --> 01:05:07,260
out of order. Okay. Well, that was cool. Make your room darker. No. I can't make my room darker.

280
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:15,579
Same reason why I can't go see a movie during the day. When... If I black out these... The curtains

281
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:20,860
and I turn all the lights off. My... It's nighttime to me. I don't like going to see a movie during

282
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,820
the day when you go into this theater and it's like, oh, it's so dark in here. It's... There's

283
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:30,219
the big screen. Oh, big... And then you walk out and it's like... Sun is out and... Oh, I was just

284
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:36,219
sitting in a pitch black room for like two and a half hours. No. I don't see movies during the day.

285
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:51,929
A movie is like a... After dinner, you go out to dinner and then like a seven to nine p.m. showing

286
01:05:51,929 --> 01:06:06,119
is perfect. Now, there are scenarios where going to a movie during the day is not a bad idea because

287
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:11,000
sometimes you save money. You know, if you go to like a noon showing, sometimes the tickets are

288
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,440
cheaper. Do they still do that or... I've been to one movie in two years or two movies in three years.

289
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:25,780
Do they still do like seven dollar matinees? Okay. I'm just making sure. Well, there's something new.

290
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:55,670
Is that supposed to be me? Like my brain stuck in this simulation? Put furniture pads on your

291
01:06:55,670 --> 01:07:01,369
furniture, please, guys. Don't be like this fucking idiot here. Those floors are expensive. Don't

292
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:08,489
ruin them. This place is finally starting to affect me. I've seen enough horror movies to

293
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:12,730
know how to survive a simple ghost or two, but these monsters keep getting faster and stranger.

294
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:31,900
Almost at 250. And I have not died yet. I swear, man. I have to do a cross-eyed thing.

295
01:07:33,699 --> 01:07:39,460
My eyes hurt. My mother warned me so many times. Don't do that. If you do it long enough,

296
01:07:39,460 --> 01:08:07,860
it's gonna stay like that. Not this again. Left, left, straight, left, left, straight, straight.

297
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:19,300
If I was a puzzle designer, that's exactly what I would have done for the second one.

298
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:24,659
In fact, I would do straight, straight, straight, straight, straight, and then just really mess it

299
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:43,779
all up. That's the sound. I haven't seen anything major in a little while, so

300
01:08:44,340 --> 01:09:09,159
don't do it. Don't, don't, don't. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Stop it.

301
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:37,689
Stop doing that. Five nights at Freddy's. Don't look directly. Don't look directly into the fan.

302
01:09:38,409 --> 01:10:04,220
Hello. Oh, it's your first day. Hello. All right. I tried to look. I looked directly into that fan.

303
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:12,489
What just happened right there? I just, I had to do the, the, the hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

304
01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:32,760
Hello. I'm doing it again. I just got like stuck. 50. Oh. Hello.

305
01:10:39,699 --> 01:11:02,649
Just keep going. Should I take, should I take the gift? Should I take the gift from

306
01:11:03,819 --> 01:11:19,779
a third of all Twitter avatars? What do you think? I can save first.

307
01:11:54,539 --> 01:12:05,989
That was funny. That was cute. I'm gonna retweet that. That was fun. Password is pumpkin.

308
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:59,109
Pumpkin. For what? We're good? Oh, this is bad.

309
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:27,109
That was another thing. No, Jeremy, you're bad. Oh shit. There's something else. Nice turtleneck.

310
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:42,979
Right. It was wrong. It was wrong. It was wrong. It's all right. I made it with just a little

311
01:13:42,979 --> 01:14:15,300
scratch. What's up tonight? What's going on here? Jeremy, Jeremy, you're almost at 300.

312
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,119
You idiot. That's a face I just made into the camera.

313
01:14:31,579 --> 01:14:39,369
Wow. It's that one worse than anything. Come on. You're almost at 300.

314
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:02,199
This music is just messing me up. It just feels like I don't want to, I don't want to hear this.

315
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:08,199
I want Yoshi's Story OST to play in the background of my streams.

316
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:40,149
Why is everyone talking about my neck? Leave me alone. What's wrong with my neck?

317
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:50,569
My neck? I'm 34. I'm not like 20. You understand? This isn't what a real neck looks like at 35.

318
01:15:51,130 --> 01:16:05,979
What do I care? But what do you guys have to say? I'm almost at 300.

319
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:40,380
He's 35 and he still gets voice cracks. That doesn't even bother me. Yeah, guess what? My

320
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:45,899
teacher. I told teachers in high school that their voice would crack because they were speaking

321
01:16:45,899 --> 01:16:52,300
continuously for like six hours. And at hour number five, they'd be like, and I, uh, you guys,

322
01:16:52,300 --> 01:17:06,119
sorry guys, I'm a teacher. That's cope. I'm giving you guys way too many like screenshots.

323
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:15,539
Sometimes I forget that like you could just rewind five seconds and stop at a single frame

324
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:35,989
and press a button. What? It's got to go faster than chair, not chair route.

325
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:58,920
Ah, this is making me sick. Did he fall off? I think he fell off the edge. Oh, no, he didn't.

326
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:47,210
His power stopped. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, 300. Anything I need to know?

327
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:53,739
Anything I need to know? That anyone's just saying anything? Somebody to know.

328
01:19:01,239 --> 01:19:17,880
You're doing good. Thanks. There's somebody behind you. No, it's not. I mean, it was that.

329
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:24,250
Better ingredients, better pasta. That's the power of Home Depot. Papa John's thing.

330
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:42,340
That's Papa John's. I don't like that pizza. Is that so wrong to say I don't like that pizza?

331
01:19:43,300 --> 01:20:18,939
My religious man. Um, not really. He's a, he's Mormon. Where are you getting the idea that I'm

332
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:28,659
Mormon? Yeah. Oh shit. Okay. This is where it gets real at 300.

333
01:20:29,619 --> 01:20:53,180
This is a good game to stream. Yeah, I'm having a good time. As much as you can have a good time,

334
01:20:53,180 --> 01:21:12,680
just having things yell at you every so often. Yeah, that's been a minute or two.

335
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:44,789
This reminds me of Dreadhalls. So I can like go into these too. Nice. Sick. Sick Windows 95

336
01:21:44,789 --> 01:22:08,460
adventure game music. Blasted. It's perfect. Now bring back the like the dunks and I just,

337
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:15,979
am I reading this out of order? One day a strange merchant came to town. He sold handmade puppets

338
01:22:15,979 --> 01:22:21,340
and trinkets and all the children loved his store and his gifts. But the town couldn't support his

339
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:26,779
store because the other shops were failing. The other shopkeepers became jealous. So one night,

340
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:37,270
some of the town's people took all his puppets and threw them in the river. But just afterwards,

341
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:41,029
he came running to the river crying and wailing that his children were being drowned.

342
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:46,140
He dove into the river trying to save his possessions. The townspeople, bitter and still

343
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:50,300
angry, watched him frantically thrash and dive into the river until he never came back to the

344
01:22:50,300 --> 01:23:18,489
surface of the water. That's a huge key. I thought the key was a pair of scissors. That's where it

345
01:23:18,489 --> 01:24:06,569
came from. Use the key. How many stars do I have? That was slow to get up. Somebody in here. Although

346
01:24:06,569 --> 01:24:13,449
not what they wanted, the shopkeepers were satisfied. Years later, the children of the

347
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:18,090
town began to go missing. And as more and more children disappeared, people began to find more

348
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:22,409
and more puppets in the forest and around the river. These puppets seemed almost to look like

349
01:24:22,409 --> 01:24:51,819
the missing children sometimes. Open door. This door looks different than all the others. Why?

350
01:24:52,699 --> 01:25:14,329
Okay. All right. So it teleports. Hey! I'm dead. I'm dead.

351
01:25:44,600 --> 01:26:11,609
No! No! No, I can't do eye shit. I can't do eye shit. I can't. I can't. I can't do eye shit.

352
01:26:12,649 --> 01:26:21,779
Harshness of choice. Now nothing you do is your fault. Now you belong to something. You belong to me.

353
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:44,579
Game over. Your soul wanders an endless maze. I think I just heard like my dog bark.

354
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:53,319
Hold on. I think he's like, maybe he wants to go in a room or something. Give me one second. He's

355
01:26:53,319 --> 01:28:54,390
like, hey, come get me. I don't know. He just kind of was, he's eaten. He ate today. He's gone out

356
01:28:54,390 --> 01:29:01,819
today. I think he was just annoyed with me that I wasn't playing with him. He was just like,

357
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:11,319
what are you doing? I was like, why are you in there? I said, hello.

358
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:16,779
And we'll see. We'll see what he does. Play with him. I just did. I played with him with a toy

359
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:37,319
and I gave him a snack. So he's good. Show auto. On my next BRB, because he's like awake. So

360
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:47,619
when I leave, I'll go bring him in here. You can say hello. No, not now. Not right now. In a little

361
01:29:47,619 --> 01:30:09,430
bit. All right. So this guy, I have to run as fast as I can. I have to do this dumb stuff again.

362
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:38,060
Get the key and open the door and 305, 306, 307, 308, three. It's not the same. This is different.

363
01:30:38,060 --> 01:31:02,739
Wait, why is this different? There's another cat dos. Physical punctures. A wooden life-size

364
01:31:02,739 --> 01:31:08,279
puppet found floating in a reservoir where a town had once been. Specimen is active despite

365
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:12,840
appearance and has proved very effective on subjects who disregard it or have vision

366
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:31,770
impairments. Disregard it? Disregard it. So I get it. I don't know what that is. Like a painting.

367
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:39,369
Specimen is constantly changing form and attributes depending on subject's personality.

368
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:45,609
The most common form resembles a wall of moving anatomy symbols. Only effective on subjects with

369
01:31:45,609 --> 01:31:55,270
past trauma or a history of psychological issues. Okay. Floating figure that appeared in a test

370
01:31:55,270 --> 01:32:00,390
chamber a few years after it was filled with what was believed to just be unusually violent

371
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:05,159
deer. Specimen seems to engulf subjects and absorb them into its torso region,

372
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:27,210
proved extremely effective on violent subjects. So don't attack this one. Exit program. Here it is.

373
01:32:28,869 --> 01:32:38,710
You'll get the key. Puppets. Watch out for the puppets. This person used, this person was a

374
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:42,789
puppet. And they are now. They used to be a person, but now they're a puppet.

375
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:51,819
So watch out and look at them because he's, he gives reactions to people that do not care about

376
01:32:51,819 --> 01:33:27,300
them. The hell did I just do? Key. All right. Let's try this again. Do I kind of like level up my

377
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:59,260
stamina bar? All right. So I, he gets mad if you don't pay attention to it. Whoa. His eyes just got

378
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:12,550
angry. Oh, he's angry. That's actually pretty scary. Where, where, where, where, where, where,

379
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:54,229
where? Oh, where, where is he? I hate that face. It's fucking horrifying. I'll go to the chair

380
01:34:54,229 --> 01:35:20,739
route. I did it. He's gone. Nice. He's not still here, right? Okay. On to three 50.

381
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:52,250
I'm seeing this brain room again. That dude's coming back. That dude's coming back. I'm certain

382
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:58,039
of it. He's going to just appear in front of me and I'm going to have to run away and turn around

383
01:35:58,039 --> 01:36:37,420
or something. Yup. I knew it. I knew it. Oh, it's this, it's this lady. Okay. Oh, he instantly died.

384
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:57,000
Find out. I'm not going to find out because I looked over at chat. I thought, I don't know,

385
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:14,409
I thought that was like one of you guys coming at me. Where's my checkpoint? Oh, that's not good.

386
01:37:14,409 --> 01:37:22,600
You get a checkpoint every hundred now. Of course. Why would it be any video games?

387
01:37:23,399 --> 01:37:43,659
I've played these already. Jeremy, could you please keep it down? I've had a horrible cold

388
01:37:43,659 --> 01:38:09,420
the last few days. I need to rest. Go take a bath. What are you doing here? Go season your bathtub

389
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:55,140
with epsom salt and make it hot enough where it's, it's our, oh, it's silent. No,

390
01:38:56,020 --> 01:39:31,189
figure it out. Watch this. How do I get out of here? You got to do a backwards long jump. Yeah.

391
01:39:31,189 --> 01:39:57,939
What am I thinking? I have to go and fly through the fucking ball. Pay attention. That's just on

392
01:39:57,939 --> 01:40:27,689
the wall now. What does that mean? That actually just scared me. That was like a scary thing.

393
01:40:28,569 --> 01:41:22,329
Stop. It's like sticking your beds on the wall. What's that? Sick. Ah, it's back. He's back. He's

394
01:41:22,329 --> 01:41:42,300
back. Um, oh fuck. Which way is it? Is it left or right? This guy, I hate this guy. He's fucking

395
01:41:42,300 --> 01:42:14,020
horrible. I have to go left. It's a goddamn chair route. Don't die. Please don't die here.

396
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:54,329
You motherfucker. You motherfucker. Get away from me. Oh my God. Oh my God. I have, how many more

397
01:42:54,329 --> 01:43:31,350
from this is it? Oh shit. God. That guy's scary. This is face. When that guy gets close to you,

398
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:56,300
he does that face and it's just horrible. Don't die now chair. He's close though.

399
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:33,979
Right this time. Right this time. Another one of these. Why? Okay. Always left.

400
01:44:37,130 --> 01:45:09,930
It's left every time. Except I did left before and it wasn't during the puppet guy. 400. Bingo.

401
01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:32,390
We got it. Yes. Yes. Keep that blood pumping. GL Labs. 40%. Pretty cool. Anything else,

402
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:57,020
anything I need to know. So there's an image. Let's see what it is. I got a nice clean tongue.

403
01:45:57,180 --> 01:46:05,239
Auto. No, I'm auto. I'm not going to get auto right now. I'm going to get auto at my break.

404
01:46:05,239 --> 01:46:10,439
I'm not going to need to go get auto. He's doing just fine. I'll get him at my next break.

405
01:46:11,239 --> 01:46:15,750
And then he's probably going to just hang out in here for a minute. I don't want auto in here,

406
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:20,390
by the way, because, oh, yeah. Let me, let me put, let me put my dog in the room and,

407
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:25,829
oh, hey guys, there's a little bed for you right here. And every 45 seconds,

408
01:46:25,829 --> 01:46:33,100
he's going to be like, what the? I don't want to do that. That's like, I'm just be scaring him.

409
01:46:33,659 --> 01:46:45,899
He scared me. Yeah. And imagine if you were a dog that was like sleeping over here, lying down.

410
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:51,020
Imagine you, imagine if you were sleeping and you've heard that. All right. I gotta pay attention.

411
01:46:51,659 --> 01:47:11,460
It's the brain again. Scalp is itchy again. Just happens. I thought they got rid of you.

412
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:14,579
I thought they got rid of you things. I thought you didn't do that anymore. I don't,

413
01:47:14,579 --> 01:47:31,670
I didn't think they did that anymore after floor 300. Why are some of these doors locked?

414
01:47:34,170 --> 01:48:12,569
Threshold of consciousness. Oh, it's a cat. That's all it was.

415
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:49,399
It's like a test of endurance. This game is a test of endurance

416
01:48:50,810 --> 01:49:07,989
to see if you can get to floor 1000. Oh, that's, I just was over there. Don't touch them.

417
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:33,670
I have to pick a side. Strawberry or vanilla. Oh, this is tough. Strawberry. Strawberry ice cream is,

418
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:41,029
wait, this is important. Strawberry ice cream is terrible if it has strawberry chunks in it.

419
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:47,189
But if it's a smooth strawberry ice cream, no bullshit, just smooth strawberry flavor,

420
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:52,310
that's the best ice cream you can possibly buy. That's just a regular ice cream. Vanilla on the

421
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:57,590
other hand, it's, this looks like vanilla bean. So that, this is, okay, so we have smooth

422
01:49:58,470 --> 01:50:04,970
strawberry ice cream and vanilla bean ice cream. That makes this a lot harder because vanilla bean

423
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:12,420
ice cream is way better. I think I would still want the strawberry, smooth strawberry. Yeah,

424
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:35,140
I'm staying with the smooth strawberry ice cream. How do I say yes? I don't think it does anything.

425
01:50:35,779 --> 01:50:43,739
Does that floor look smooth to you? It's pixelated. That's, this floor is pixelated too.

426
01:50:44,699 --> 01:51:13,539
Should I touch all this stuff? All right, well, whatever. I chose mint chocolate. No, pistachio

427
01:51:13,539 --> 01:51:22,250
without pistachios. One of the best ice creams is pistachio ice cream. What without, I just spit

428
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:27,699
them out. See me and, me and Kim, we do this thing where when I get pistachio ice cream,

429
01:51:27,699 --> 01:51:33,539
I just eat the ice cream and then I, I spit out the pistachios and then she eats them.

430
01:51:34,899 --> 01:51:46,069
That's not weird. I eat, well, look, let me tell you, I eat around the pistachios and then like,

431
01:51:46,069 --> 01:51:53,539
they just, I just don't eat them. I will save big chunks of ice cream with pistachios in them

432
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:58,739
and I make a little corner that's like, that's for Kim because she likes, she loves pistachios.

433
01:51:58,739 --> 01:52:03,140
So I make, there's like 12 pistachios just sitting in the corner with like ice cream around them and

434
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:15,180
she just eats them. I don't like, I mean, I don't like spit them out, Mr. Q. That's disgusting.

435
01:52:15,899 --> 01:52:42,579
Yeah, just, telephones are ringing. Telephones are ringing. Ah, become, follow the group.

436
01:52:44,779 --> 01:53:00,409
Free come more than yourself. Be who you are. Follow the group. That's what it says. Be who you

437
01:53:00,409 --> 01:53:07,529
are to others. Oh, the dev is not a three. I thought it was like a three. How did I see

438
01:53:07,529 --> 01:53:17,399
that differently? I saw three E. It was fucked up. No, it was fucked up. See the backgrounds changing

439
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:21,800
behind this sometimes. It actually, clip it and look at it. You'll see what I'm talking about.

440
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:32,470
Trust me. Also, butter pecan ice cream falls in this category as well. Butter pecan ice cream is

441
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:38,550
absolutely delicious, but get those pecans out of there. The actual butter pecan flavored

442
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:46,840
ice cream is incredible. I just want to buy just the ice cream. Why is that so strange?

443
01:53:49,989 --> 01:53:52,710
And then they decided they were going to come up with something called butter crunch

444
01:53:53,800 --> 01:54:03,590
and it's that butter pecan ice cream. What's happening? It's the bugs. Okay.

445
01:54:03,590 --> 01:54:10,409
Okay. Butter pecan ice cream turns into butter crunch and then they turn the pecans

446
01:54:11,050 --> 01:54:17,930
instead of pecans. It's now these chunky, crunchy, buttery, tasty, sweet things. And that's all right.

447
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:22,170
That's a step in the right direction, but you need to go full blown only butter

448
01:54:22,170 --> 01:55:05,300
flavored ice cream. The butter pecan flavored ice cream. That's blood. Knowing your shadow can

449
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:14,470
greatly help you, but be ready to see what you'd rather not be. Knowing your shadow. Watch out for

450
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:43,220
your shadow. It was scary until you added the Mario sounds. What is that? What the fuck is that?

451
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:47,140
What was, what is that? What's that thing? What do I do about the, oh, it's the wall guy.

452
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:51,619
It's the wall guy. And now the Indiana Jones river is flying over here.

453
01:55:52,260 --> 01:56:08,300
What do I do with wall person? Do I step? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What do I do

454
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:19,270
with the wall? I just heard auto again. All right. Hold on. I have to like, let me, let me go try to

455
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:40,520
like see if he wants to go out. I'm going to take like a few minute break here. Oh shit. Uh oh.

456
01:56:41,079 --> 01:56:49,220
This is like a countdown. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. I got, I've got to

457
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:57,159
go see, I've got to go take out a lot. I'll be right back again. Sorry. I need to see what,

458
01:56:57,159 --> 01:57:02,920
I need to see what Otto needs. I don't think he's hungry. I think he's been fed. All right.

459
01:57:02,920 --> 02:02:53,369
I'll be right back. Let me see what's going on. Okay. I'm returned. Uh, he had to take a big dump.

460
02:02:54,329 --> 02:03:06,260
That's what happened. And he didn't want to come upstairs with me. He was like running around. He

461
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:12,180
didn't, he took, he did with that thing where he took a big dog poop and he was just so happy

462
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:17,060
to have taken that dog poop that he was just like, everything is great now. And he just

463
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:33,109
sprinting around. He didn't want to come up here. You'll see him today. Later. Not there. I don't

464
02:03:33,109 --> 02:03:40,890
want that. That's not, I don't want to bring him up here during the scream game because what,

465
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:45,989
because once I bring him up here, you know, he's in the room and he's hanging out and he's like,

466
02:03:45,989 --> 02:03:49,189
it's all right. All right. Now you're out of here. It's like, well, I, you just brought me in here

467
02:03:49,189 --> 02:03:57,380
to hang out with you. Sorry. I don't want to scream and have you hear my screaming while you're

468
02:03:57,380 --> 02:04:05,819
trying to sleep. Bring him up during the outro. Yeah, I know you'll see him. You'll see him later.

469
02:04:05,819 --> 02:04:18,569
You will see Otto on this stream or I'll do a 24 hour stream. By the time this stream turns off,

470
02:04:18,569 --> 02:04:34,359
you will see Otto. All right. That was left, left, right, straight, left, right, left, right.

471
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:53,640
See, I'm a puzzle master. That's how I knew how to do that. All right. Don't, I don't want to get

472
02:04:53,640 --> 02:05:02,970
cocky or anything because it really is, it's every hundred floors, rooms, whatever. I forgot

473
02:05:02,970 --> 02:05:25,829
to apply my lip balm. Balm streamer. Yeah. Somebody said you have dry ass lips and I was like,

474
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:31,060
fucking I'll fix it. I get dry lips, especially out here in Vegas.

475
02:05:31,060 --> 02:06:09,659
Vegas. Yeah. I live in Las Vegas now. Yes, I do. Really? This whole time I've just been

476
02:06:09,659 --> 02:06:22,500
living in Massachusetts. I think this room, last time something jumped out there.

477
02:06:24,439 --> 02:06:45,479
Oh, it's the, it's the girl. Where? Why am I? I'm going back. Oh, my head. That just like short

478
02:06:45,560 --> 02:07:40,600
circuited. Oh no. Where's this exit? Am I insane? Why are you still here? It's going to be the puppet

479
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:49,800
guy again. I knew it, right? What's that thing? What's that mean? That's new. That's new. That's

480
02:07:49,800 --> 02:08:03,079
a new sound. What's the cardboard? Oh, there was the cardboard did late. It screwed up.

481
02:08:12,729 --> 02:08:26,819
This thing, their cues all the time. What's that one? This means something, right? Oh, it's a bug.

482
02:08:27,779 --> 02:08:43,850
Okay. Anytime you hear the, it's the big caterpillar. Get out of the way, coffee.

483
02:08:45,529 --> 02:09:19,319
Okay. I'm good. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. What is this? What is that?

484
02:09:21,800 --> 02:09:33,060
Oh, it's this thing that makes everything all weird. Oh shit. Okay. They're almost there.

485
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:47,779
Almost there. Almost there. Almost there. 484. Not going to happen anymore. You're not going to get

486
02:09:47,779 --> 02:10:03,779
me, but it's like 15 times you've gotten me. Not going to happen again. Am I good? I'm good. All

487
02:10:03,779 --> 02:10:41,100
right. Thank God. Halfway point coming up. Little shit. Didn't get it. Okay. I'm good. Go back. Go

488
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:47,220
back. You don't go back in this game. You only go forward. Can you fall off the edge?

489
02:10:47,859 --> 02:11:02,500
I don't want to test that. I'm so glad nothing's following me. Table ending.

490
02:11:13,079 --> 02:11:15,960
Jeremy, I'm trying to catch up with you playing Darkwood and you're streaming again.

491
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:26,260
Hey, what's up? And we're streaming tomorrow, too. You'll be happy to know that tomorrow is

492
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:43,260
Darkwood again. A va de friends. Give me that. 500. Password is.

493
02:11:43,739 --> 02:11:55,000
Well, here you are. Still here. Next door is going to fix up for you. So enjoy and keep moving on.

494
02:11:59,699 --> 02:12:07,380
So pumpkin cheese. Next one's going to be cake and the next one's going to be

495
02:12:07,380 --> 02:12:16,020
latte. At the last floor. Why can I not save the game? There we go.

496
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:27,479
Pumpkin cheese. 500 rovers. I saved it. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. So this one's out of order

497
02:12:27,479 --> 02:12:31,720
and this one's not out of order. I mean, you go to the one that's out of order.

498
02:12:40,710 --> 02:13:17,270
Never mind. Let's go halfway there. Why is this 52? I don't know if this means anything,

499
02:13:17,829 --> 02:13:21,350
but I just got logged in and I got logged out and logged in on Steam.

500
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:54,550
Save corrupted. Room 53. No, this is scripted. This is scripted. This is scripted. I'm going to

501
02:13:54,550 --> 02:14:04,409
get to like floor 100 and it's going to be, it's going to be like, oh, you made it. Why'd you go

502
02:14:04,409 --> 02:14:09,529
that way? Now walk into this portal. The cat's going to come back and I'm going to go to like

503
02:14:09,529 --> 02:14:23,699
portal and go to five, like 50. That's definitely how this is going to work. He's lost it.

504
02:14:26,229 --> 02:14:27,590
Yeah, this is a different room too.

505
02:14:29,909 --> 02:14:50,100
MonkaS. Can you only talk in the auto voice till you get to floor 100? Yeah.

506
02:15:25,210 --> 02:15:46,890
Edward002313BFBGEL. Cannot release twice. Exit through express. I told you guys this

507
02:15:46,890 --> 02:16:19,420
wouldn't happen. You didn't get to 100. I got to 100 five times. That's 500.

508
02:16:24,649 --> 02:16:28,500
You got to hear it. Good. Good.

509
02:16:30,409 --> 02:17:19,020
Good. Good. Bugs. Bugs. Bugs. Good. Good bugs. All right. God. Open. Yeah. I don't even, I don't,

510
02:17:19,020 --> 02:17:22,780
they just get me because they're just annoying. They just get in the way.

511
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:25,020
And of course I have to react because I have to get out of the way.

512
02:17:25,819 --> 02:17:44,200
531. All right. I can't fucking do that right now. I'm trying.

513
02:17:45,319 --> 02:17:47,239
My, both my ears are blocked. I can't do anything.

514
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:06,459
That's yeah, that's the bank of fucking America. What about it?

515
02:18:20,969 --> 02:18:30,219
This is new music. What is that? I don't know what this new music means, but I have to move.

516
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:47,620
Don't attack the one. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Preparing for it. Whatever it is.

517
02:18:53,420 --> 02:19:01,719
Okay. We're outside. There's a cabin. For a while, I thought I had really escaped this place,

518
02:19:01,719 --> 02:19:06,600
but despite the trees and flora, I think this is actually just another room.

519
02:19:07,399 --> 02:19:16,059
I did hope to find deer, so I might at least get to eat and make some strange sounds though.

520
02:19:16,059 --> 02:19:28,700
This is the deer enemy, which I was told do not attack the deer enemy. Don't attack the

521
02:19:30,299 --> 02:19:41,000
What the fuck is wrong with you? I don't know what they are, but those are definitely not deer.

522
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,379
No shit. I tried sneaking up on one the other day to kill for food,

523
02:19:45,379 --> 02:19:49,989
but it saw me as soon as I got close. I was barely able to get away from the thing.

524
02:19:49,989 --> 02:19:56,629
I've managed to board up most of them. Hopefully I can find another way out of here.

525
02:19:56,629 --> 02:20:17,989
Don't get, don't get near them. Do not go near them. I thought I said don't attack them.

526
02:20:42,309 --> 02:21:11,940
What? We're inside of a computer. They don't follow you into rooms, right? I hate this music.

527
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:38,950
It's like an untuned piano underwater. What the fuck are you? Hi, what's happening? How are you?

528
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:43,799
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who is that person?

529
02:21:43,959 --> 02:22:02,489
Oh, no, no. It's the person that runs in front of you. I don't know what that means.

530
02:22:02,489 --> 02:23:04,489
What does it say? Is it a Borg? Toast. It's the guy. It's the guy. Oh, no. This was the worst.

531
02:23:04,489 --> 02:23:10,489
This was worse. This spit on me. This spit all over my mouth. This is blood. I can't tell.

532
02:23:10,489 --> 02:23:44,520
I have like a big spit wad on my mouth. You need to get your submission

533
02:23:44,680 --> 02:24:09,510
is forfeit to me. I will devour your flesh. That guy wasn't as scary as this guy. What?

534
02:24:09,510 --> 02:25:00,940
I need that heal. Let's go. You did it. You actually, you did it. You did it. Hello. You

535
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:05,979
were at, you did it. You did the thing. You did it. You did it. I didn't do it. You did it.

536
02:25:05,979 --> 02:25:11,209
You actually did it. I knew it. Break the fan. Don't look in the fan. I've been

537
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:45,479
600 Romans. It's 60% of the way through this. 600. Oh, dude. Oh, pog, dude.

538
02:25:46,600 --> 02:26:34,860
Pog. All right. This is Pillar. Make like a tree and die coming this fall. Interesting. I still

539
02:26:34,860 --> 02:26:44,299
have the axe, right? That comes with me. What are most of those never-ending hallways that I

540
02:26:44,299 --> 02:27:08,469
came across? Don't hurt them. Well, what are they doing? If a guy's running down a hallway with an

541
02:27:08,469 --> 02:27:19,959
axe, I don't think it's smart to jump out in front of them and yell. I would stay closed. I would

542
02:27:19,959 --> 02:27:29,020
not open. Especially if the person was like panicking. Oh, shit. You don't want to start

543
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:40,549
off a panicking guy with the axe. That's just, that seems like common sense. Oh, this is not

544
02:27:40,549 --> 02:28:05,020
good. I don't know where I'm going. Oh, that doesn't work. This whole place is somehow even

545
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:09,979
worse than the new GL labs. Although it seems to have been constructed with a much larger budget

546
02:28:09,979 --> 02:28:14,780
than the new lab, nothing works quite right. I can see why it was abandoned so quickly.

547
02:28:15,579 --> 02:28:23,979
I wonder if there really is anything here worth salvaging. Reset.

548
02:28:23,979 --> 02:28:51,420
Reset. Power's back on. Go this way.

549
02:28:54,379 --> 02:29:42,069
This is loud. This is very loud. Make it louder. I don't, you don't want this to be louder. This,

550
02:29:42,069 --> 02:29:50,469
not this, not this, not a vent. Not a vent. The easiest horror game environment is the vent.

551
02:29:51,430 --> 02:30:19,899
And it is the most effective. It's the goddamn vent. Spooky just said that there were things

552
02:30:19,899 --> 02:30:25,420
we needed to salvage from this place. I'm starting to worry that a loose specimen may be included in

553
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:30,940
the list of things for us to retrieve. The power just shut off again. Is everything broken in here?

554
02:30:58,180 --> 02:31:05,129
I don't know what to do. I can't think while I feel strange. I'm hiding from that thing.

555
02:31:05,770 --> 02:31:11,290
I feel like something is growing on my skin. I can't seem to tear it off fast enough. I'm

556
02:31:11,290 --> 02:31:23,850
losing a lot of blood. That thing. Can I please go in a different room now? Oh.

557
02:31:26,329 --> 02:31:30,899
You have to keep it close. It becomes something else when it gets too far away.

558
02:31:30,899 --> 02:31:39,690
Something I can't outrun. I'll, I'll give it a try. I'm going to give it a try.

559
02:31:41,290 --> 02:32:05,829
Stay close. Get over here. Stay near me. It hurts. Hey, it said keep the thing close.

560
02:32:05,829 --> 02:32:34,299
It's turned into an animal. Jump scares always distance 242. What does that mean?

561
02:32:39,079 --> 02:32:55,540
Okay, so I need to keep it close. I can't kill it. So just back around. Why am I wearing two

562
02:32:55,540 --> 02:33:01,139
headphones? You monster. Well, because if I have one headphone and I can't hear them come around

563
02:33:01,139 --> 02:33:06,100
corners, and it is a horror game and there is a face cam on, so I might as well really, really go

564
02:33:06,100 --> 02:33:54,549
for it. 604. Shit. Keep it close. Here we are. 607. 608. What? 609. Wait, what's that sound? I

565
02:33:54,549 --> 02:34:08,309
forget. This is it. Okay, I made it. All right. All right. So just keep it close. Just back away.

566
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:23,799
Turn off my lights in my room. No, I'm not going to the movies. I'm not going to the movies during

567
02:34:23,799 --> 02:34:57,500
the day. Lights off, you're a coward. During the day. Okay, here we go. This is all just for show.

568
02:34:57,500 --> 02:35:29,770
Nothing happens in here. Stay close, but not too close. Yes. This is it.

569
02:35:32,969 --> 02:35:57,610
Where's the fucking door? Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Let's go.

570
02:35:58,170 --> 02:36:39,909
Hi. Where's the door? Where's the door? Right here. I want you to look at me.

571
02:36:41,670 --> 02:37:12,139
Look at me. What's my range? I'm not very good. I wonder what happens if I sprint around the

572
02:37:12,139 --> 02:37:29,110
circle, but I don't want to lose. I want to find out. Is it getting faster? Come on. Come here.

573
02:37:31,620 --> 02:37:47,819
How long is this going to go on for? Still following me.

574
02:38:13,049 --> 02:38:27,670
Oh, this guy sucks. How far is too far? I wonder. Watch the door. You're doing an escort mission.

575
02:38:27,670 --> 02:38:47,219
Yeah, that's what it feels like. All right. The scare factor on this dude is gone.

576
02:38:47,219 --> 02:39:15,219
No, you're just kind of sad. What the fuck was that? He's gone. What was that? You are here.

577
02:39:15,219 --> 02:39:37,829
622. Who is it? What is that? It's you again. I thought we were done with this. Not for another

578
02:39:38,709 --> 02:39:59,270
20 rooms, apparently. Just ditch him. Just ditch him. But it said that if I go too far away,

579
02:39:59,270 --> 02:40:02,069
he'll turn into something that it's impossible for me to run away from.

580
02:40:02,790 --> 02:40:26,280
To wait for you. No, I'm not going to ditch him. I don't even know where the hell I'm going though.

581
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:56,600
How far is too far though, I wonder. Let him grab your butt. Do it. I'm not going to do that.

582
02:40:56,600 --> 02:41:20,649
But what if he kills you instantly? Going this way. It's going to be a pop-up thing.

583
02:41:24,969 --> 02:41:34,700
Come on. You're slowing me down. I did so many rooms so fast. Now I have to do it like this.

584
02:41:35,579 --> 02:42:02,709
Let's go. Needed a few extra punches there. Getting tired. Snorlax, whatever his name is.

585
02:42:02,709 --> 02:42:21,979
What am I doing? No, I guess that makes sense. What's the thing from Star Wars that eats the

586
02:42:21,979 --> 02:42:34,860
people? It looks like that big circle. The Snorlax. I said you're looking tired. I didn't mean

587
02:42:34,860 --> 02:42:44,870
like Snorlax tired. I meant like Sarlacc pit. That's just what I called him. I didn't mean to

588
02:42:44,870 --> 02:43:01,559
make that be actually like Snorlax. Guys, I'm bored and I have to walk with this toddler back

589
02:43:01,559 --> 02:43:36,309
here. Thank god. Not that way. You dare. No, you dare come in one of these rooms.

590
02:43:46,469 --> 02:43:53,100
Where that monster is going to be a pain in the ass is when I don't know what's about to happen

591
02:43:53,100 --> 02:44:00,459
and it happens and I'm just running. That's going to be bad. He's closed when he first comes

592
02:44:00,459 --> 02:44:21,899
in a room and then he opens. So that's what he looks like. 640. Getting there. Dev in chat. Dev

593
02:44:21,899 --> 02:44:42,170
in chat. What's up? What's going on? I wonder what happens when I get to a thousand. They spread him

594
02:44:42,170 --> 02:44:46,969
out far enough that you just forget that it's even possible. All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

595
02:44:47,610 --> 02:45:08,010
In order to survive this house, I need to keep writing notes. I must do everything a central

596
02:45:08,010 --> 02:45:14,180
protagonist would and hope this is one of those stories. Insert obscure horror reference that

597
02:45:14,180 --> 02:45:32,440
no one gets and misinterprets as instructions somehow. It's me. It's me writing those notes.

598
02:45:33,239 --> 02:45:40,860
I'm just getting weirder and weirder as I go. Come on. Come on. You don't think you try to make

599
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:44,379
yourself laugh when you came around the corner for like a hundredth time. I don't know what this

600
02:45:44,379 --> 02:46:04,329
means. Oh, it's just the your flesh will be mine. Oh, I this is this is such a this is that the

601
02:46:04,329 --> 02:46:10,579
person runs in front of you. Here we go. They remember this. You have to go around like three or

602
02:46:10,579 --> 02:46:48,549
four times. Sprints and screams at the screen like right now. I missed it. Good. I didn't see it.

603
02:46:49,270 --> 02:47:07,620
There wasn't even any music. Their music usually starts. They have a whole song. They have a

604
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:27,450
soundtrack for these monsters. Clicking. Is that what it is? He's right behind me.

605
02:47:53,479 --> 02:48:04,500
What? Oh, isn't this the that's not the music for the I thought that was the music.

606
02:48:05,299 --> 02:48:07,219
No, I don't have I can't do it. I have to run.

607
02:48:08,659 --> 02:48:13,219
Time to sprint sprint. Go. Go. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna get hurt. It's okay. I can take a few hits.

608
02:48:22,579 --> 02:48:34,219
Almost 700.

609
02:48:45,180 --> 02:48:52,100
Those can be attributed to somebody just sticking a fork into your back randomly. Like I know they're

610
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:57,700
in the room. Like if Kim was sitting behind me right now with a fork and every like 12 minutes

611
02:48:57,700 --> 02:49:04,649
she just went like that. I'd be like it would scare me. It'll be like fucked up. I know you're

612
02:49:04,649 --> 02:49:13,450
back there. I know you're gonna do it. But I don't know when or why. Why is everybody writing single

613
02:49:13,450 --> 02:50:08,459
twos? Oh, no. It's dark. It was way too dark. Oh, that's horrible. I don't know where I am.

614
02:50:08,459 --> 02:51:07,510
What the fuck is the door? That sucks. Pog. Hey, Pog. That's all I gotta say. That's all I gotta say.

615
02:51:08,409 --> 02:51:19,049
Anyone notes? Wrong way. LOL Pog. You don't Pog after an LOL. Actually, yeah, maybe you can.

616
02:51:19,930 --> 02:51:38,010
Depends on the scenario, I guess. Thankfully, no one's here. 700 coming up.

617
02:51:39,129 --> 02:51:47,770
Just gotta make it to 700. Still don't understand what that's for.

618
02:51:59,129 --> 02:52:03,319
Okay, don't fight it, right? Just run.

619
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:23,690
Your submission is- You! I keep cutting this guy off. He's just like,

620
02:52:23,690 --> 02:53:06,489
I- You're- Because you're freaking me out. You don't say your submission is inevitable.

621
02:53:07,209 --> 02:53:15,670
And then why are you running? Your submission is inevitable. I will devour you.

622
02:53:16,629 --> 02:53:26,600
Why are you running away from me? Fuck off. Well, I still haven't died,

623
02:53:26,600 --> 02:53:32,889
so it appears I might be the protagonist, but I'm not entirely sure. I hope I'm not some side

624
02:53:32,889 --> 02:53:37,610
character that leaves notes for pointless exposition. Also, I found a strange computer

625
02:53:37,610 --> 02:53:41,610
that gave descriptions of the monsters, and it seems like they are called effective based on how

626
02:53:41,610 --> 02:54:29,299
many people they kill. Shit. Left. Right. Right. Right, left, right, left, right, left. Floor 700.

627
02:54:31,540 --> 02:54:38,120
That much closer. Keep that blood pumping. All right, anything going on?

628
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:51,370
This is my time to interact with you guys. We only have 300 rooms left, yeah?

629
02:54:53,850 --> 02:55:01,930
Auto. Get auto. I will be at the stream. I missed 666. I was being chased by a monster,

630
02:55:01,930 --> 02:55:16,600
and I didn't want to go back to 600. All right, let's keep going. No, I said by the end of the

631
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:23,850
stream, if auto wasn't on it, then I would do a 24 hour stream. So, I just have to show auto

632
02:55:24,489 --> 02:56:05,829
before I turn off the stream. 701. Let's go down. Notes.

633
02:56:12,469 --> 02:56:17,299
I want to see the computer again. I feel like there's a few specimens I need to take a look

634
02:56:17,299 --> 02:56:40,729
at that I don't know about. Restaurant? Taste the beef. 100% beef. What's on the menu? I can't read

635
02:56:40,729 --> 02:57:00,979
that far. That looks like shit, actually. An old egg McMuffin. Fun rules. Okay, well, I need a key.

636
02:57:04,389 --> 02:57:14,309
Behind the counter? One, I was anxious getting a job here at first, but it seems like things

637
02:57:14,309 --> 02:57:19,430
are getting better. This chain is really expanding, which is a shock. Because just last week,

638
02:57:19,430 --> 02:57:24,790
I heard this company was going broke. Every day, more and more people show up to eat here.

639
02:57:24,790 --> 02:57:28,790
Something still sets me off about this place and its food, though. So, I'm going to try and not

640
02:57:28,790 --> 02:57:49,129
eat anything from here. Into the freezer. Today was a weird day. The average number of orders

641
02:57:49,129 --> 02:57:55,290
continues to rise as is, as it has been. But I don't know about the number of people. Today,

642
02:57:55,290 --> 02:58:00,090
I saw someone else, someone use the drive-through and order a lot of food for one person. And then,

643
02:58:00,090 --> 02:58:04,729
about 10 minutes later, they were back. They ordered the same exact meals, and then they left

644
02:58:04,729 --> 02:58:09,370
again. Then after another 10 minutes, they were back again. Maybe they're just delivering food

645
02:58:09,370 --> 02:58:13,770
for a party or hotel, but it worries me for some reason. I've done that plenty of times.

646
02:58:17,159 --> 02:58:22,200
You guys have never done that before? You've never driven to Wendy's? You get two meals.

647
02:58:23,239 --> 02:58:29,239
You finish both of them. You park. You just literally park your car and sit and eat in the

648
02:58:29,239 --> 02:58:34,840
parking lot. And then you just want to make sure that you're still not hungry. So then you go back

649
02:58:34,840 --> 02:58:41,879
and you get a soda or you get a frosty or something if you want. Or a small bacon cheeseburger. What

650
02:58:41,879 --> 02:58:47,590
do they call it? The small ones. The ones that everyone loves. Junior bacon cheeseburger. Maybe

651
02:58:47,590 --> 02:59:08,329
you want one more. That happens often. Why? What? Somebody was in here? Did I take too long? I took

652
02:59:08,329 --> 02:59:21,799
too long in here. Thankfully, it's 700. I stood still for too long. Okay. Anyways, I've done that

653
02:59:21,799 --> 02:59:42,549
before. Lost to Wendy's. Something like that. Wendy's Wheel. All right, let's go.

654
02:59:44,229 --> 03:00:10,969
I want to get to 800 by three hours and 12 minutes. That's it. That was that was 12 minutes from

655
03:00:10,969 --> 03:00:21,180
what I just said. Okay, into the restaurant. So I was in here. Can I go in any of the bathrooms?

656
03:00:26,459 --> 03:00:31,020
Well, I broke my one rule today. The management doesn't give out actual lunch breaks.

657
03:00:31,020 --> 03:00:35,659
So I can't go anywhere and they won't allow outside food here. I mean, they actually screamed

658
03:00:35,659 --> 03:00:40,940
at the last customer who did that. Anyway, I had a burger. It wasn't bad and I don't feel sick. So

659
03:00:40,940 --> 03:01:22,219
I might get a few every now and then. Got a key. It was in here. Yep. They're probably,

660
03:01:23,420 --> 03:01:30,280
they're probably eating people. Yeah, this is a weird day. It worries me. Somebody came over here

661
03:01:30,280 --> 03:01:52,860
and they ordered the same thing three times. Well, that's the way in. It's this one. This is

662
03:01:52,860 --> 03:01:58,379
strange. I had a dream last night about this restaurant. I know I was here, but I also felt

663
03:01:58,379 --> 03:02:04,780
like I was in another place at the same time. Everything looked so wrong. Nothing was the right

664
03:02:04,780 --> 03:02:10,379
size. And I kept hearing these strange animal noises. Almost like wailing. I guess I just feel

665
03:02:10,379 --> 03:02:15,340
guilty for eating that burger the other day. Also today I saw that man again, the one who kept

666
03:02:15,420 --> 03:02:22,700
ordering every 10 minutes. This time he never even left the parking lot. Then he just got his meal

667
03:02:22,700 --> 03:02:36,360
parked and then back in line. He must have done it at least eight times. He must be this tall.

668
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:41,319
No screams. Look out for snakes. No alcohol. No diving. No hiding. We will find you.

669
03:02:42,120 --> 03:03:04,010
Laugh it up. Shoes. All right, let's go. There was a horrible accident today. At least that's what

670
03:03:04,010 --> 03:03:07,770
the managers are calling it. One of the other employees brought in some outside food and got

671
03:03:07,770 --> 03:03:11,850
into a fight with the manager about it. No one's coming in here, right? The employee said that the

672
03:03:11,850 --> 03:03:16,170
burgers here smell like sulfur. I then watched the manager grab the kid's neck and shove his

673
03:03:16,170 --> 03:03:20,489
head into the grill. The employee got up and ran out before anyone could do anything and I'm told

674
03:03:20,489 --> 03:03:35,350
that he's fine, but that really shook me today. I can't sprint in here if you're curious. I think

675
03:03:35,350 --> 03:03:47,860
because I'm crouching. This is still the same room too. Oh, give me a break. There's something in here.

676
03:03:48,819 --> 03:04:01,239
What is this?

677
03:04:20,920 --> 03:04:52,500
Get me out of this. There's a key. Okay, got the key. What's that key for? In here? The freezer.

678
03:04:52,500 --> 03:05:03,979
Hey, one of these is gonna wake up and I hear somebody behind me. I can hear somebody here.

679
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:10,549
I got another key. I hear somebody behind me. I hear somebody. What's that music supposed to mean?

680
03:05:11,430 --> 03:05:18,540
One of these is gonna grab me. What's the what's the fucking key for, folks? What's the demon?

681
03:05:21,659 --> 03:05:24,620
What the fuck am I supposed to do about the demon? How do I get out of here?

682
03:05:28,520 --> 03:05:51,979
Whoa! What door is it for? That's the entrance. I'm dead. It's the Burger King demon. Did I just

683
03:05:51,979 --> 03:06:06,870
break the game? I don't know what that specimen does. I don't understand. This looks like somebody

684
03:06:06,870 --> 03:06:16,379
in the room. Is somebody in this room? No. He hides the doors. You dastardly motherfucker.

685
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:29,879
Oh, no, no. It's too hard to get away from people when they're...

686
03:07:03,260 --> 03:07:21,719
Hey, just go, go, go, go, go, go. Don't stop for nothing. Unless it's the squid person.

687
03:07:24,520 --> 03:07:28,540
Oh, not you again. I'm actually not scared of this person at all.

688
03:07:29,100 --> 03:07:45,000
I don't even know what this thing does, but it doesn't scare me.

689
03:07:54,340 --> 03:07:55,139
Oh, don't get...

690
03:08:00,280 --> 03:08:03,559
They float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float,

691
03:08:03,559 --> 03:08:07,639
they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float,

692
03:08:08,200 --> 03:08:30,600
go, they float, they float, they float. Oh, this is bad.

693
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:48,420
Okay, this sounds like when your English teacher has, they have a Halloween event

694
03:08:49,940 --> 03:08:59,879
and like Mrs. Stevenson recorded some scary lines and it's played over the school haunted house.

695
03:09:00,760 --> 03:09:21,500
Your flesh is mine. No, but you know what I'm saying. It's like a...

696
03:09:23,139 --> 03:09:46,329
I made it. Weird fucking teachers. No, no. Unlimited stamina. Thanks a lot.

697
03:09:46,329 --> 03:09:54,040
I told you it was going to be pumpkin cheese cake latte. I told you this and I, it's, I told you.

698
03:09:57,850 --> 03:10:04,020
Eee. It's going to be pumpkin cheesecake latte and then someone's going to be,

699
03:10:04,020 --> 03:10:07,620
a scary ghost is going to be drinking a latte at the end and that's the joke.

700
03:10:08,340 --> 03:10:22,620
If I got it, don't tell me I got it. Infinite stamina. Oh, well, here's the, the kicker here

701
03:10:22,620 --> 03:10:32,520
is the stamina. There is no, there is no sprint. I can't run. I think the effectiveness of the

702
03:10:32,520 --> 03:10:36,520
specimens is also somewhat related to the souls of the people that they killed. Anyway, I'm still

703
03:10:36,520 --> 03:10:41,719
alive and strong, but I feel like the most, the inmost cave of my journey lies ahead. I wonder

704
03:10:41,719 --> 03:10:51,350
what the antagonists will look like. I hope they're cute. No more sprinting. That's not good.

705
03:10:55,459 --> 03:11:21,100
He's clenching his ass. I probably will be in about a hundred rooms. So how do you get away

706
03:11:21,100 --> 03:11:26,139
from things if you can't, do I have to seriously run and like walk in a circle to bait around in

707
03:11:26,139 --> 03:11:35,909
a circle and not get stabbed somehow? How does one do this? This is impossible with some of these

708
03:11:35,909 --> 03:11:53,399
monsters. I have to kill. Infinite axe attacks too though. That's right. That's a good call.

709
03:11:54,120 --> 03:12:08,250
Just jump on them like Super Mario. Thankfully, it's 750. They, they did that because this would

710
03:12:08,250 --> 03:12:14,139
be a pain in the ass to walk through all these again. So I get it. Let's make it not happen to

711
03:12:14,139 --> 03:12:41,079
me. Pac-Man's like my favorite character. Why would I do that? Oh, I can move again.

712
03:12:42,040 --> 03:12:45,190
Big mistake. Giving that back.

713
03:12:47,750 --> 03:13:05,379
Finally, I get a computer. Finally, I get some extra computer time. Let's see. Specimen. Where

714
03:13:05,379 --> 03:13:11,819
were we? Eight. Okay. A float guy. I have to get closer. I have to, I'm too far away from the

715
03:13:11,819 --> 03:13:20,540
screen. I'm standing all the way back here. Like, hold on. Stop. Get out. Back. There we go. Get

716
03:13:20,540 --> 03:13:29,530
close. You guys have ruined, you've ruined me because that said eat ass in my brain for a second.

717
03:13:29,530 --> 03:13:42,620
Total fatalities. One. Take the dead. Two. Take the dead. To take the dead. To take the dead.

718
03:13:42,620 --> 03:13:53,340
That doesn't really help me at all. It does this thing. Parasitic infections that form change a

719
03:13:53,340 --> 03:13:59,979
creature that is believed to be extraterrestrial though was not officially proven. Proved very

720
03:13:59,979 --> 03:14:03,579
effective on most subjects but deemed too difficult to contain. The specimen broke out

721
03:14:03,579 --> 03:14:13,319
of its containment area due to frequent electrical malfunctions. That's the thing. A

722
03:14:13,319 --> 03:14:18,860
floating red figure that was found inside a secret area below a large abandoned corporate office

723
03:14:18,860 --> 03:14:24,340
once owned by a restaurant franchise. The specimen is extremely violent and also seems to leave the

724
03:14:24,340 --> 03:14:30,100
house at will despite various containment methods. Victims vanish on contact with specimen but

725
03:14:30,100 --> 03:14:36,899
sometimes remains of the victims have been found inside the testing chamber days later. Proved

726
03:14:36,899 --> 03:14:55,260
not effective as victim's souls do not remain after contact. What does that mean? I want to

727
03:14:55,260 --> 03:15:03,639
see what this thing is. Proved extremely effective on violent subjects and you just you have to just

728
03:15:03,639 --> 03:15:38,620
run away. Seven six five. Let's go. Almost the big 800. More of these tubes. What's the lightning

729
03:15:38,620 --> 03:15:49,620
strike for? I just realized that I never had a mentor figure. Trial or leaving home scene.

730
03:15:50,260 --> 03:15:53,940
That means the story isn't following the archetypes to make me a traditional hero.

731
03:15:54,020 --> 03:15:57,459
Which means I could be killed off. Well it was nice for a little while at least.

732
03:15:58,260 --> 03:16:21,159
I haven't seen a special infected in a while. It's gonna happen soon. Holy shit. Holy shit. I

733
03:16:21,159 --> 03:16:57,049
wasn't prepared for you to be here. I hate this motherfucker so much. Oh fuck. Where is he gonna

734
03:16:57,049 --> 03:17:06,709
be? I don't know. Somewhere over here. Oh fuck. I've ruined everything this way. Why?

735
03:17:07,510 --> 03:17:26,219
Why is it giving me these same shitty rooms over and over again? You dickhead. Heal. Heal for a second.

736
03:17:26,780 --> 03:17:38,489
Go. Oh fuck you.

737
03:17:51,030 --> 03:18:18,889
Okay. Look for an arrow. Look at the fish. He's gone. 800. Come on. Don't fuck around. Just get

738
03:18:18,889 --> 03:18:24,760
there. There's gonna be another thing that's gonna pop up. I don't care. I don't care.

739
03:18:37,510 --> 03:18:54,170
Special effects. Two. See ya. This is the English teacher.

740
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:17,590
All right. No more. No more getting stuck on that one. So English teacher. See ya. 800. 200 more.

741
03:19:17,590 --> 03:19:32,549
Norma's there. Norma link please. Norma please say hello. Like hello? Why? I don't understand.

742
03:19:32,549 --> 03:19:58,219
Why? Why? That link didn't open by the way. Click this link. All right. Hold on. I'm gonna

743
03:19:58,219 --> 03:20:12,010
put this on the screen. I want to read this one. Hey! Did I save the game? Did I save the game?

744
03:20:13,399 --> 03:20:20,250
I don't think I saved the game. I don't think. Did I save it? Wait. What happened?

745
03:20:21,129 --> 03:20:26,569
What is going on? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. This is like a... I can't see chat room. What

746
03:20:26,569 --> 03:21:22,520
happened? Chat is broken right now. Why did it open like five doors? Streamer fatalities. Method

747
03:21:22,520 --> 03:21:27,959
bad jokes. This specimen likes to make funny noises and bad jokes in order to satisfy the voices in

748
03:21:27,959 --> 03:21:34,840
his head. Escaped confinement throughout the use of a hot air balloon. Actually insane. Avoid all

749
03:21:34,840 --> 03:21:44,579
contact. Use the word boomer if approached to drive it up. That's a pretty good one.

750
03:21:45,459 --> 03:21:53,459
I hope I saved the game because that would be a no- I would hate to have to go through

751
03:21:54,260 --> 03:22:08,219
those 50 zones again. 800. Thank god. Saved. 800. Got the axe. I'm ready. Let's move.

752
03:22:09,500 --> 03:22:19,850
I'm gonna find out what the real story of this game actually is. Did I make it to 800 in the time

753
03:22:19,850 --> 03:22:29,049
that was a lot? I didn't realize that guy had a unique kill screen in save rooms. That's

754
03:22:29,049 --> 03:22:45,909
completely new to me. Yeah. That was kind of weird. Yeah. Day two. Food supply depleted.

755
03:22:45,909 --> 03:22:50,469
Water supply at 30%. Mental health deteriorating. Leaving notes behind to help others and mark where

756
03:22:50,469 --> 03:23:14,170
I've been. Is there more? No. Day two. Room 800. Well, I'll be fair to the game. I've been streaming

757
03:23:14,170 --> 03:23:20,729
for three and a half hours and gone through 800 rooms. So, I mean, that's- that makes sense. It

758
03:23:20,729 --> 03:24:01,739
would take you that long if you weren't sprinting. Did I always wait till 809? 709? Okay. It's still

759
03:24:01,739 --> 03:24:15,059
the same room somehow. Broken. This is a big room. This mansion is strange. I think the bricks and

760
03:24:15,059 --> 03:24:20,819
wood are actually just painted on. Everything still feels kind of fake. Also, I keep hearing

761
03:24:20,819 --> 03:24:36,229
movement and voices below me. Maybe other survivors are hiding down there. That's strange. Locked.

762
03:24:36,229 --> 03:24:50,870
Probably go up the stairs. Broken. Okay. Damn library. Someone's gonna be here.

763
03:24:52,409 --> 03:24:56,489
I can hear him coming down the hallway. I need to hide, but I don't know where.

764
03:24:56,489 --> 03:25:00,729
I now know this is not an exit or a resting place. It is just another specimen room. I think he's

765
03:25:00,729 --> 03:25:16,520
outside the door now. Well, where do I hide? Where do you hide, huh? This is a terrible- this is a

766
03:25:16,520 --> 03:26:07,399
two-year-old hiding spot. He gone? Where is he? Look up there. His head's gonna be poking over

767
03:26:07,399 --> 03:26:41,690
and he's gonna go, hey! And it's gonna be terrifying. Let's go upstairs. Locked doors. I can't hide there?

768
03:26:41,690 --> 03:26:47,540
I somehow managed to get away, but I don't know for how long. I hear him. Even when I know he's

769
03:26:47,540 --> 03:26:52,260
not there, it's like he isn't even real, but instead my own fears manifesting themselves and stalking me.

770
03:26:53,219 --> 03:27:10,200
Hide. So what? He's not real. So that he can't hurt me. So I'll be fine. Confront him. I need a key.

771
03:27:17,639 --> 03:28:55,059
Both these doors are broken. Come on. Every room looks the same. Every room's the same room.

772
03:29:12,219 --> 03:29:49,659
That's one squeaky gamer chair. I'll tell you, I don't think that guy could lift that side.

773
03:29:50,299 --> 03:29:56,780
I don't think I have anything to worry about. That looks a little too heavy for you.

774
03:29:57,340 --> 03:30:19,190
Can I recommend a sickle? Can I recommend- can I recommend a knife? It is a sickle.

775
03:30:19,190 --> 03:30:25,739
There's a side. The side- a sickle is a small side. The side is huge. The side is- it's like

776
03:30:25,739 --> 03:30:40,010
a harvesting side. Pick up a key. Get the library key. Nice. So that's bedroom, bedroom, library.

777
03:30:42,819 --> 03:31:09,030
Currently looking for a library. Locked. Is this the library? No. The library is probably-

778
03:31:09,670 --> 03:31:30,600
let's try this one. Hold on a second here. Library. No. Library. Library.

779
03:31:50,520 --> 03:32:04,250
What the fuck is happening? None of these are the library.

780
03:32:07,159 --> 03:32:08,040
That's not the library.

781
03:32:33,450 --> 03:32:48,020
What? I- I don't know where the library is. Where is it? Stop it. Stop- I've been in every

782
03:32:48,020 --> 03:33:14,870
single door. I've been in every door. All the same room. Oh my god. There's a book missing.

783
03:33:14,870 --> 03:33:58,579
Other- hide, hide. This is the relatable content that I come here for. Thanks a lot.

784
03:33:58,579 --> 03:34:10,280
I feel like I could just go push him. That's a full four and a half seconds for you to lift up

785
03:34:10,280 --> 03:34:26,870
that. I could just shove you to the ground. Do it then, because this is taking way too long.

786
03:34:26,870 --> 03:35:02,180
I'm just gonna go. Are you going? I didn't hear the door open. Picked up the book. Go replace

787
03:35:02,180 --> 03:35:40,840
the book in the library. Secret door. Finally made it out of here. What the fuck does that mean?

788
03:35:41,479 --> 03:35:59,100
I'm still in room 810? Man. Oh, remember when the note said I can hear people running around down

789
03:35:59,100 --> 03:36:17,540
here? Was I hearing me? What does that mean? Why is this music changing? Oh, give me a break.

790
03:36:23,780 --> 03:36:37,989
I'm still doing laps upstairs. I get a note down here. I can hear somebody running around in circles

791
03:36:37,989 --> 03:36:57,299
upstairs. It's really odd. I wonder what they're up to. This is all one floor. I hope I make it

792
03:36:57,299 --> 03:37:23,879
to 850, because I don't want to do this whole thing again. Exit. Exit key. What do you mean the exit

793
03:37:23,879 --> 03:37:49,819
key? I don't know. I know. It's the door. It's the door. It's the door up here. It's up. And then

794
03:37:50,860 --> 03:37:58,090
it's somewhere. I have to remember. Goldfish, goldfish, goldfish, goldfish kid. Goldfish kid.

795
03:37:59,930 --> 03:38:11,049
Go up. Out. Out of here. Out of here. Out of here. Oh no. I'm gonna get lost again.

796
03:38:11,450 --> 03:39:05,030
That's what somebody, that bagpipe player face. Don't make me laugh right now. A bagpipe player.

797
03:39:05,909 --> 03:39:48,469
What does that even mean? Give me 850. Ah, shit. Hello. Why is everybody linking me saying hello?

798
03:39:49,030 --> 03:40:09,860
Nobody was. I think one person did actually. One person linked me saying hello. And I said

799
03:40:09,860 --> 03:40:28,659
everybody. I just lumped you all together. Only like 10 more. What is it? What is it though? What

800
03:40:28,659 --> 03:40:53,579
is it? Okay, stay close. This is thing blocking me. I'm so glad I only have to do this for like

801
03:40:53,579 --> 03:41:24,229
six more floors. He doesn't know. No, I don't. I, I, I do not. You're right. I don't, I don't know.

802
03:41:25,190 --> 03:41:57,370
49. All right, let's go. 50. Oh, this is bad. Okay, I have to do all 100.

803
03:42:02,309 --> 03:42:15,049
That's not good. What am I, what am I doing? I got complacent for like 30 seconds.

804
03:42:24,629 --> 03:42:29,000
Just run now. No, I'm good. I didn't go away. I didn't go away far enough for long enough.

805
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:38,600
I really just don't, I don't want to do this again. So I need to be locked in to get to 900.

806
03:42:39,239 --> 03:43:09,989
At least this gives me a minute to relax. I think this is locked. I may have made a mistake coming

807
03:43:09,989 --> 03:43:32,090
back here. This is locked, I think. Check it. No. Attack it. No. I'm not gonna. He's still here.

808
03:43:32,809 --> 03:44:15,450
He's still here. He's still here. It's this way. Good thing I did it. It's either way. It doesn't

809
03:44:15,450 --> 03:44:24,309
matter. Just run. You cannot run. Come on, guys. Don't you know this by now? I can't run from this

810
03:44:24,309 --> 03:44:31,270
thing. If I run far enough away, it turns into a mother monster that I cannot run from. Now we're

811
03:44:31,270 --> 03:45:05,370
good. Almost there. Not long now. Just go faster. I have a stamina bar. I can't do that. I'm just

812
03:45:05,370 --> 03:45:19,290
waiting to hear that pound. It's a ding. It's a ding donk. Left. Left. Three lefts. And then a

813
03:45:19,290 --> 03:45:43,399
straight. Three lefts and then a right. I'm good. Game room. I already played all these. 30 more

814
03:45:43,399 --> 03:45:53,350
rooms. Is it? Oh, it's this thing. I forget. I remember. I forget what this one does. I have

815
03:45:53,350 --> 03:45:58,889
to go back and then run this way. It's gonna scream. Get ready. Here comes the scream. It's

816
03:45:58,889 --> 03:46:51,850
gonna scream at you. Just do it already. All right, sit up. Don't lose it here. I can taste it. Come

817
03:46:51,850 --> 03:47:14,840
on. What is it? What is it? What does that mean? I don't remember. There's too many monsters to

818
03:47:14,840 --> 03:47:49,559
remember. I looked at chat for a second and it was one of those poppers. What is it? Monk! I'm

819
03:47:49,559 --> 03:47:57,690
actually okay with this. I'm all right with this. That's fine. It's just not knowing what it is.

820
03:47:58,329 --> 03:48:05,450
I can't believe I'm actually going to do this. I'm gonna get to the floor thousand.

821
03:48:19,020 --> 03:48:35,399
Four more and I get to 900. Almost there. Come on. Two. 899. This is it. This is the home stretch.

822
03:48:40,180 --> 03:49:08,139
Only 100 more floors. And that's it. And I beat the game. Here we go. You're still on the first

823
03:49:08,139 --> 03:49:45,670
island. You used that one last night. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, left, straight.

824
03:49:49,020 --> 03:49:58,309
Okay. Day three. Hallucinations are manifesting at increasing intervals. The cause is probably

825
03:49:58,309 --> 03:50:04,229
sleep deprivation or a gas that is being pumped into the rooms. I've not yet been injured so I

826
03:50:04,229 --> 03:50:23,899
don't think the cause is a brain injury or blood clot. It's this thing. Oh no.

827
03:50:25,100 --> 03:50:33,100
Counting how many times I've said oh no. Or what does he do? What does he do? What does he do?

828
03:50:46,420 --> 03:50:52,899
Research report. More whales are being shipped to the facility tomorrow. Wow. One for a health

829
03:50:52,899 --> 03:50:57,700
inspection and two that are already dead for autopsies. That thing's gonna attack me from

830
03:50:57,700 --> 03:51:01,940
somewhere. More and more beached whales keep appearing around these islands and I still can't

831
03:51:01,940 --> 03:51:12,760
find out what's causing it. I don't even have a flashlight or anything. I am going to get stuck

832
03:51:12,760 --> 03:51:23,100
here. Whale 15D has died much sooner than I expected while I was away on holiday. I regret

833
03:51:23,100 --> 03:51:28,379
not being here but I had estimated it would live much longer. The team that did the autopsy said

834
03:51:29,020 --> 03:51:34,299
nothing seemed to be wrong with the lungs but the stomach had a circular hole about two feet

835
03:51:34,299 --> 03:51:39,260
in diameter all the way through to the outside of the whale. This pretty much confirms a parasite

836
03:51:39,260 --> 03:51:57,739
is the cause of death. There's the whale. What is going on in this game? And now I have to deal with

837
03:51:57,739 --> 03:52:08,979
this stuff. I have to try to remember this. It's so dark. I'm gonna get so lost. The research

838
03:52:08,979 --> 03:52:14,180
facility is now in dire need of more engineers. We have a whole block that is flooded and some

839
03:52:14,180 --> 03:52:30,139
vital staff are missing. Is there a key or something? Shit. Can we get a sweat check?

840
03:52:32,440 --> 03:52:51,379
It's gone. It's going. It's oh it's it's going. It's still alive but gets into fits of thrashing

841
03:52:51,379 --> 03:52:57,799
and is surfacing more from the natural. Something wrong with its lungs. I will have to allow it to

842
03:52:57,799 --> 03:53:06,200
die from whatever is causing it and then do an autopsy. Whale 14D has strange small bite marks.

843
03:53:06,200 --> 03:53:10,280
They appear from another smaller mammal but the strange thing about them is their placement.

844
03:53:10,280 --> 03:53:14,120
They're in even rows inside the whale's stomach all about five feet from the bottom of the stomach

845
03:53:14,120 --> 03:53:32,889
lining. I just got a lantern. This thing doesn't run out of gas right? Excerpt 4132 and then I

846
03:53:32,889 --> 03:53:38,889
watched carelessly as the sea rose above the sky casting waving shadows over the world. I saw the

847
03:53:38,889 --> 03:53:42,889
silhouettes of creatures both familiar and forgotten and suddenly I found myself falling

848
03:53:42,889 --> 03:54:04,010
upwards towards an ocean of darkness. All right four one what was it four one four one three what

849
03:54:04,010 --> 03:54:30,969
four one three four one two three there it is read I hear a girl or an animal or something

850
03:54:30,969 --> 03:54:36,250
singing to me pleading that I come outside my locked room and let the sweeping waves comfort me

851
03:54:39,100 --> 03:54:50,920
water pump control restarting pumps what is uh where do I go what does that even do

852
03:54:51,639 --> 03:54:54,489
what does that do what's that even do though what's that do

853
03:54:56,340 --> 03:55:25,239
is the whale did I did I drain the pump did I drain the whale this was the same place twice

854
03:55:40,360 --> 03:56:02,260
there is one two doors here this was under water is it going to be like a killer whale

855
03:56:02,260 --> 03:56:43,110
if the whale is going to be on here there's nothing in this room did I try every door broken

856
03:56:43,190 --> 03:56:57,299
it's broken did I miss like a key on the ground or anything on anything in here

857
03:56:57,299 --> 03:57:05,239
at all I don't think there's anything in here why would I be able to come in here though

858
03:57:15,129 --> 03:57:36,020
nothing in here either funny joke what the hell are you talking about what do you mean funny

859
03:57:36,020 --> 03:57:42,059
joke I'm trying to go in all these doors there's nothing in any of them there's a key on the box

860
03:57:43,020 --> 03:58:02,219
what like in this room okay let me be fucking real with you for a second that key is painted

861
03:58:02,219 --> 03:58:32,870
on the top of the box it's all good all right where's the locked one there's a locked one here

862
03:58:32,870 --> 03:58:44,659
you can't go in that locked one and there's nothing else in here so this is a key for a

863
03:58:44,659 --> 03:58:54,549
different door back here you're legally mad and you're internally sad what about over here broken

864
03:58:54,549 --> 03:59:08,200
come on who the hell are you whoa you're an enemy and you're now in the am I safe here

865
03:59:08,200 --> 03:59:28,139
I think I'm safe here holy fucking hell I'm safe on the boxes wait for full health go

866
03:59:50,920 --> 04:00:04,889
this way and then this way it's not so bad once once you know what you're doing

867
04:00:29,190 --> 04:00:31,829
there's even more of this shit at least the numbers are going up

868
04:00:32,629 --> 04:01:01,459
box steps what happened to the whale oh let me see a box I don't see a box

869
04:01:05,850 --> 04:01:43,860
I think I just screwed myself nope right here let's go right how many more of these do I have to do

870
04:01:44,659 --> 04:02:08,579
919 920 am I just stuck down here for the rest of the time that I play this game

871
04:02:09,219 --> 04:02:30,809
I got out of the water I'm starting to lose track of time the battery on my phone became very low

872
04:02:30,809 --> 04:02:46,500
so I delegated to save it in case I find an exit where is it a phone all that was an axe

873
04:02:48,700 --> 04:03:08,379
holy shit it's the guy with the thing in his arm what you I thought it was him I thought that was

874
04:03:08,379 --> 04:03:54,540

875
04:03:54,540 --> 04:04:06,010

877
04:04:43,750 --> 04:05:05,719

878
04:05:11,530 --> 04:05:55,239

885
04:08:43,420 --> 04:09:11,350
you why is this here no old victorian mansion that seems to build itself around its environment

886
04:09:11,350 --> 04:09:16,469
specimens sometimes chooses a host to possess and uses them to attack the subject with various means

887
04:09:16,469 --> 04:09:20,309
depending on the host's characteristics not much is known about the origin of the mansion but

888
04:09:20,309 --> 04:09:24,229
signs occasionally show an earlier massacre a tragedy has taken place within the mansion

889
04:09:24,229 --> 04:09:28,700
we're very effective but varies itself too often to be reliable method of extraction

890
04:09:28,700 --> 04:09:47,639
so the house is alive this is not a time to use the computer this is not a time to use the pc

04:27:08,629 --> 04:27:12,469
for a thousand rooms it's a show of endurance I'm putting this on my gamer license card

936
04:27:13,110 --> 04:27:33,459
the hospital all right I just got a treatment for doing that water bubbler this is where you

937
04:27:33,459 --> 04:27:45,780
save the game at the drinking fountain that's nice okay there's a bathroom let's go here

938
04:27:47,239 --> 04:28:02,899
can't go here let's go here can't go here broken oh you need to go to the doctor

939
04:28:03,860 --> 04:28:12,899
um immediately hopefully within the next 10 minutes because that's not all right

940
04:28:14,420 --> 04:28:27,909
I'm so glad that that you added flushing toilets in the DLC think of a joke quick there isn't I

941
04:28:27,909 --> 04:28:44,260
wouldn't there's blood in a urinal I mean it's an improv class let's do uh blood uh in a urinal

942
04:28:44,819 --> 04:28:55,959
and you're at the hospital and um and there's a banana involved okay well gotta use the bat

943
04:28:55,959 --> 04:29:23,450
no that's gonna go bad it's getting scary never say no to an improv session I don't know how

944
04:29:23,450 --> 04:29:30,489
poorly I would do it an improv session I'd probably be pretty bad it would be bad I would

945
04:29:30,489 --> 04:29:36,100
be doing stream references and all the people that were there watching the improv session would have

946
04:29:36,100 --> 04:29:41,399
no idea what they were I would throw that you'd see at least like one or two like look at me

947
04:29:41,399 --> 04:29:49,700
and the people watching would be like that's not funny wait hold on uh patient displayed

948
04:29:49,700 --> 04:29:54,020
increased depression after informed of their terminal disease I prescribed an antidepressant

949
04:29:54,020 --> 04:29:58,200
to regulate this but was later told that I had canceled the prescription no memory of

950
04:29:58,200 --> 04:30:01,000
canceling the meds nor the quantity of evidence that my orders were tampered with

951
04:30:02,200 --> 04:30:19,180
okay now it's a yes and a string I remember playing SCP with these stairs um let me check

952
04:30:19,180 --> 04:30:30,379
the other rooms that stream would start out with a bunch of people watching and then after they

953
04:30:30,379 --> 04:30:38,860
realized that this was not a good improv session half of the people would leave they would be like

954
04:30:38,860 --> 04:30:44,459
wow an improv session on twitch the wits is so interesting wow that's so cool and look at me

955
04:30:44,459 --> 04:30:52,020
look at me I got a banana here oh whoopsie and it would be like this I ain't a professional

956
04:30:52,020 --> 04:31:17,340
I'm a professional clown hey no I can't move that way broken and it might be fun though

957
04:31:17,899 --> 04:31:32,219
office key seems we're losing patients due to surgical complications much more often than

958
04:31:32,219 --> 04:31:36,620
normal what have the doctors been doing half these procedures seem completely unnecessary

959
04:31:36,620 --> 04:31:41,180
I know the doctors and surgeons are above me and probably know many things I don't but this is

960
04:31:41,180 --> 04:32:01,459
getting strange oh by the way this is just coming out of like left field here but um I know I

961
04:32:01,459 --> 04:32:05,860
mentioned it yesterday but I'm getting in front of the I'm going in front of the green screen again

962
04:32:08,120 --> 04:32:16,569
in probably like at some point after Halloween at some point after Halloween like maybe like the

963
04:32:16,569 --> 04:32:21,290
first week of November or something I'm gonna we're gonna do a green screen part two DLC for

964
04:32:21,290 --> 04:32:26,729
free edition where I spend like another five to six hours doing all the things that anybody wants

965
04:32:26,729 --> 04:32:43,540
me to do that's after Halloween after Halloween do six hours of look at me I'm not gonna do that

966
04:32:43,540 --> 04:32:54,649
all right I gotta I got the office key that's that all right it's upstairs and I think it's

967
04:32:54,649 --> 04:33:05,860
one of the ones I couldn't do before so there has not been a monster yet which is the one that

968
04:33:05,860 --> 04:33:26,819
was locked stairs broken now remember wash your hands remember wash your hands everyone

969
04:33:27,860 --> 04:33:43,590
of uh remember wash your hands remember wash your hands everyone of

970
04:33:44,229 --> 04:33:54,709
clean your workspace I'm attending to the office work hard and have a nice day I don't know

971
04:33:54,709 --> 04:34:03,209
I can't read that any of you guys in office which one of you guys is an office

972
04:34:04,090 --> 04:34:19,319
none of you are in office so where's the office back here looks like an office

973
04:34:21,020 --> 04:34:26,220
it seems the other me has been giving him large doses of hallucinations they have

974
04:34:26,220 --> 04:34:29,419
worsened the depression and he is now constantly screaming and expressing terror at seemingly

975
04:34:29,419 --> 04:34:36,299
random intervals I've tried using a diet out assist machine it to remove some of the drugs

976
04:34:36,299 --> 04:35:03,900
but it seems futile office what's that looks like something goes here so there's a little

977
04:35:03,900 --> 04:35:25,610
thing that's got to fit in that slot a little circle broken nothing in here I don't know

978
04:35:26,650 --> 04:35:31,740
another note I was just informed that the procedure to extract the patient's liver

979
04:35:31,740 --> 04:35:37,659
became fatal I don't know why why did we take his liver there are no donation requests and he was

980
04:35:37,659 --> 04:35:42,939
showing signs of improvement the surgical staff told me I personally demanded the liver be removed

981
04:35:42,939 --> 04:35:48,139
for an emergency transplant and the worst thing is I found it I found his liver his entire liver

982
04:35:48,139 --> 04:36:11,020
just sitting on my desk maintenance key that's horrible maintenance diff deformity wing looks

983
04:36:11,099 --> 04:36:23,419
fake it's electrically sealed I blacked out today while driving to work one minute I was driving

984
04:36:23,419 --> 04:36:27,819
down the road and then in an instant I was standing outside my car staring down at a dead cat

985
04:36:27,819 --> 04:36:32,380
I must have hit it with my car and felt sorry the image of the dead cat has constantly unnerved me

986
04:36:32,380 --> 04:36:37,020
today how did I manage to hit it in such a way to make the body completely twisted around like that

987
04:36:37,740 --> 04:36:58,840
that's not good all right I have the maintenance key now maintenance save it so we've got two

988
04:36:58,840 --> 04:37:05,400
ways to go here this this is not open but where's maintenance because these are

989
04:37:06,360 --> 04:37:14,020
hospital rooms the stairs going down was it another stairway was it downstairs because this

990
04:37:14,020 --> 04:37:36,979
is locked I would feel like a maintenance room would be down here maintenance room the generator

991
04:37:36,979 --> 04:38:04,729
powered down uh it won't turn back on oh this is good why did you do that to progress the story

992
04:38:04,729 --> 04:38:18,869
to progress the game I definitely have to just go back upstairs so this is not so much a this is

993
04:38:18,869 --> 04:39:04,310
like a whole new little mini game huh great where was that tendril wasn't there a tendril

994
04:39:04,869 --> 04:39:21,209
there was like that big like uh amorphous thing you guys know what I'm talking about

995
04:39:21,209 --> 04:39:44,020
remember the thing I was trying to hit with the axe it was down one of these hallways fake okay

996
04:39:44,099 --> 04:40:16,540
okay just paint it on nope patient did not recover from the blood loss I feel like there is a monster

997
04:40:16,540 --> 04:40:21,020
inside my head and it's pushing me away while it works on something I woke up in the patient's

998
04:40:21,020 --> 04:40:27,500
room standing over him while an arterial catheter was in the patient letting him just bleed out into

999
04:40:27,500 --> 04:41:16,599
the floor ah something gonna happen here something is happening what's what's going on why is it

1000
04:41:16,599 --> 04:41:39,849
happening other than what the numbers are there numbers I feel like I shouldn't move yet

1001
04:41:40,889 --> 04:41:59,619
that was cool maybe I have to do that eventually for some other reason

1002
04:42:07,110 --> 04:42:30,220
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait where's this

1003
04:42:30,220 --> 04:43:03,270

1004
04:43:03,270 --> 04:43:04,950
guy's gonna start following me around

1005
04:43:36,099 --> 04:44:02,099

1006
04:44:03,400 --> 04:44:16,729
anything to explain anything back here I still need to find that thing that goes in the

1007

05:06:33,979 --> 05:06:57,049
I was hoping it was gonna end just keep them coming you can't nobody no human can do that

1077
05:06:57,049 --> 05:07:04,169
for more than eight seconds all right isolation room key now that's a fun story called where

1078
05:07:05,130 --> 05:07:31,979
the is that a he said fuck I did isolation room that's this deformity wing that's the exit

1079
05:07:32,779 --> 05:07:53,430
I didn't say the game is about to be a monster why do you don't have this why why this is a pg stream

1080
05:07:53,430 --> 05:08:00,659
mom said have to leave well your your mother should know that we're playing a scary game

1081
05:08:00,659 --> 05:08:16,650
and sometimes you get terrified where is he there he is this bag doesn't seem very fast

1082
05:08:17,369 --> 05:08:29,639
and he doesn't seem hostile okay he is hostile but he's very slow he hurts a lot though

1083
05:08:35,700 --> 05:08:52,409
isolation where it was down right wasn't it down wasn't it down it was down wasn't it I passed it

1084
05:08:53,799 --> 05:09:07,750
no I didn't no it was down yeah it was down in the morgue so this is incorrect it's the one that

1085
05:09:07,750 --> 05:09:31,099
has the blood on it where was that because there's this one through here I think it's this yeah it's

1086
05:09:31,099 --> 05:09:53,849
this one right here down to the isolation room which is here we are okay open note it wasn't me

1087
05:09:53,849 --> 05:09:58,409
I swear it wasn't it may have been my body and my hands but I know it wasn't me

1088
05:10:01,340 --> 05:10:16,709
what is me it was just my body my hands and my intention but I didn't do it it wasn't me

1089
05:10:20,680 --> 05:10:30,099
that's not a really good defense will the defendant please rise and state what they just said

1090
05:10:30,099 --> 05:10:39,819
in private I stabbed him and I strangled him and I said in my I was like I'm God want to

1091
05:10:39,819 --> 05:10:45,849
strangle you and I stabbed you but I don't I don't I didn't do it though somebody else did

1092
05:10:47,380 --> 05:10:58,569
and who is this other person you your honor and then I fucking like right into the camera

1093
05:10:58,569 --> 05:11:10,259
I found out how to stop them you see they are in my head and can control me for a time

1094
05:11:10,259 --> 05:11:15,139
but if I keep using the radiology machine to dose my head with radiation then they go away for a

1095
05:11:15,139 --> 05:11:34,069
while this is fucking crazy how big is this area this place is huge another note no I went

1096
05:11:34,069 --> 05:12:18,779
backwards sorry I went backwards that door is locked remember it where the hell is this

1100
05:13:06,869 --> 05:13:25,400
okay that was kind of funny I think I got it no I think I don't got it um there's a bug on my head

1101
05:13:32,419 --> 05:13:38,540
it's just that's okay that's not a rumor that's in the game I thought that was two

1102
05:13:38,540 --> 05:14:03,020
rumors back to back well here's the fun part they're lost too we both can't find each other

1103
05:14:03,020 --> 05:14:17,080
got it I'm so sorry my little angel I tried hating the man that took you from us but in the end the

1104
05:14:17,080 --> 05:14:20,439
only person I hate is myself you always like to scare people especially when they didn't

1105
05:14:20,439 --> 05:14:26,520
understand something I was confounded no one understood your costume but I guess people don't

1106
05:14:26,520 --> 05:14:32,680
read Poe anymore even with the new Price film that man clearly overreacted to your fireworks

1107

through the maze again no I don't go where's that exit it's over here somewhere yeah

1109
05:16:02,310 --> 05:16:48,950
I am not in control anymore that's a bad ending that was bad ending what about the

1110
05:16:49,110 --> 05:16:52,709
the weird like organic material that was in the hallways

1111
05:16:53,590 --> 05:16:59,290
but could I not do anything with those things oh that's actually the good ending

1167
05:35:46,330 --> 05:35:49,930
everybody for watching we're gonna do the bits and everything if you're new to the channel

1168
05:35:50,650 --> 05:35:56,090
at the end of a stream we do a wind down where I go over all the bit messages that were certain

1169
05:35:56,090 --> 05:36:03,830
threshold because I do not read messages on stream I do not read subs or bit messages on stream

1170
05:36:03,830 --> 05:36:12,299
unless they are of a very large denomination and it did happen somebody gave 5 000 bits earlier

1171
05:36:12,299 --> 05:36:18,919
somebody gave 50 dollars earlier and I didn't see it it was a little too locked in to the horror

1172
05:36:18,919 --> 05:36:30,409
game but back we had a I missed this too uh Tyler McVicker I came in with a raid earlier so thank

1173
05:36:30,409 --> 05:36:35,189
you appreciate that if you had a good stream if anybody was stuck around from that channel thanks

1174
05:36:35,189 --> 05:36:46,439
a lot I lied about Darkwood what are you talking about playing it tomorrow I said if I still had

1175
05:36:46,439 --> 05:36:59,610
time today I was gonna move on to it but I'm just gonna play it tomorrow what what don't let Darkwood

1176
05:36:59,610 --> 05:37:13,590
become the new dragon's dogma I'm playing Darkwood tomorrow that is the stream tomorrow huh I'm going

1177
05:37:13,590 --> 05:37:22,970
to complete Darkwood hopefully tomorrow I don't believe you so you admit the dragon's dogma is

1178
05:37:22,970 --> 05:37:39,020
never happening no it's not it's not I'm sorry get your Pluto's out you ever lied about Darkwood

1179
05:37:39,900 --> 05:37:46,119
I said if I had I said if this I said if this game took me like three or four hours then I would play

1180
05:37:46,119 --> 05:37:53,990
Darkwood for a few hours but this took like almost six hours so that's we're just gonna put it on

1181
05:37:54,950 --> 05:38:00,869
I'm just going tomorrow everybody just relax Martin had a meme thanks for the 250 bits

1182
05:38:00,869 --> 05:38:06,360
appreciate it I'm a big fan of the private school bully who constantly brings up how much money his

1183
05:38:06,360 --> 05:38:18,259
dad is worth hair get out of here thank you green bog for the thousand bits thank you today's my

1184
05:38:18,259 --> 05:38:24,580
birthday I'm a 22 year old depressed and neat I'm learning Japanese because I like cute anime shows

1185
05:38:24,580 --> 05:38:31,139
which helps take away the pain so I might be some translator or live in Japan it feels romanticized

1186
05:38:31,139 --> 05:38:38,229
but it is my only chance at experiencing real life well let me tell you something very very very

1187
05:38:38,229 --> 05:38:47,770
very seriously if you're doing something that you like if you want to be a translator learn Japanese

1188
05:38:47,770 --> 05:39:11,580
and live in Japan go for it do it grab it by the horns and do it and go for it there are a lot

1189
05:39:12,220 --> 05:39:17,020
let me tell you something there are a lot of companies that really do look for translators

1190
05:39:17,020 --> 05:39:26,790
and look for people to kind of be the middle person for a offshore companies like for instance Kim

1191
05:39:26,790 --> 05:39:32,229
speaks fluent Vietnamese there are a lot of opportunities for her to just be the middle

1192
05:39:32,869 --> 05:39:41,319
woman for a Vietnamese client for different companies it is it's a skill it is a thing being

1193
05:39:41,319 --> 05:39:49,369
bilingual trilingual it that's that's a skill it takes a lot to do that to know like two three

1194
05:39:49,369 --> 05:40:00,259
or four languages fluently completely so what you're describing is potentially a real thing

1195
05:40:03,189 --> 05:40:11,049
go find it I really hope you do happy birthday by the way 22 years old you have plenty of time

1196
05:40:13,830 --> 05:40:30,340
you're still young very young so don't worry do what you can I wish you the best of luck take care

1197
05:40:35,180 --> 05:40:39,099
sticks renegade thanks for the 250 unfortunately pappaginos and d'angelo's are beginning to close

1198
05:40:39,099 --> 05:40:44,939
down that's a horrible thing to hear there's three left near me d'angelo's in this place and

1199
05:40:44,939 --> 05:40:57,860
pappaginos here and one more here I miss five dollar unlimited pizzas why is pappaginos closing

1200
05:40:57,860 --> 05:41:09,049
down they had the best chain pizza I've ever had pappaginos is disgusting goodbye omega lull

1201
05:41:09,369 --> 05:41:22,310
all right for one second I thought you were saying that like pappaginos is disgusting all

1202
05:41:22,310 --> 05:41:30,340
right goodbye I'm gonna get banned like bye omega lull like I gotta get this out before he bans me

1203
05:41:30,340 --> 05:41:41,819
for saying this give him two minutes that's unfortunate because I really do like pappaginos

1204
05:41:41,819 --> 05:41:53,669
pizza I would not choose pappaginos over some non-chain Italian restaurants in some local

1205
05:41:53,669 --> 05:41:59,750
pizza places way better but if I had to pick a chain pappaginos would probably be the best one

1206
05:42:06,069 --> 05:42:11,159
but yeah that's that's sad to hear thank you pigeon for the 250 this is a thought I had in

1207
05:42:11,159 --> 05:42:26,740
the shower whose customer service was or is worse cox or comcast cox cox because there seems to be

1208
05:42:26,740 --> 05:42:34,180
so many people that work for cox and none of them talk to each other at least with comcast so I had

1209
05:42:34,180 --> 05:42:41,909
comcast business and cox business and comcast business when they sent somebody out that person

1210
05:42:42,709 --> 05:42:48,630
at least was in communication with somebody else that they needed to be in communication with

1211
05:42:48,630 --> 05:42:56,180
to help fix a problem the cox support they just they're none of them talk to each other

1212
05:42:56,819 --> 05:43:03,060
so you have like the tech guy the mechanic you cox has like five character classes

1213
05:43:04,150 --> 05:43:13,000
the phone support phone maintenance supervisor it's it's there's so many people

1214
05:43:15,590 --> 05:43:21,750
sales you'll get a call from sales and all of them have no idea what the other person has just told

1215
05:43:21,750 --> 05:43:31,669
you I would get I would ask questions right for I'm going to give you a very specific example of

1216
05:43:31,669 --> 05:43:41,189
this so a technician a maintenance technician told me a straight-up maintenance guy in the truck

1217
05:43:41,189 --> 05:43:46,389
said hey if you get a static IP it actually is going to push your traffic to the front of the

1218
05:43:46,389 --> 05:43:51,750
line possibly and might help out because it's a static IP okay that's really cool let me call and

1219
05:43:51,750 --> 05:43:56,470
talk to somebody about getting a static IP hey if I get a static IP yeah I want it because it's

1220
05:43:56,470 --> 05:44:05,259
going to put my traffic potentially in the front of the line no it isn't who told you that um the

1221
05:44:05,259 --> 05:44:11,000
person in the truck the pride and then you would say a name I don't know what that is we don't know

1222
05:44:11,000 --> 05:44:19,500
what those people are I also asked if business lines and for cox have priority over residential

1223
05:44:19,500 --> 05:44:28,580
and I was told by three different fucking people yes no yes and then no by the guy in the truck

1224
05:44:28,580 --> 05:44:39,209
that's the problem with cox and half the time it's a salesperson that just wants you to buy

1225
05:44:39,209 --> 05:44:51,400
the product and will tell you literally literally anything you want to hear yeah business gets a

1226
05:44:51,400 --> 05:44:57,639
priority traffic and uh yeah it's uh they do different parts priority oh that's awesome

1227
05:44:58,279 --> 05:45:09,849
yeah I'll take it it sounds like a crock of bullshit no it is it's stupid it's hard to even

1228
05:45:09,849 --> 05:45:18,709
get a question answered about if you go further than reset router and

1229
05:45:21,380 --> 05:45:26,040
then if you go further than that that person does not know what to tell you

1230
05:45:31,340 --> 05:45:38,139
Comcast business was it still sucked don't get me wrong here this is not this is a contest

1231
05:45:38,779 --> 05:45:48,650
of who made the worst pie not who made the best pie this is a who made the best disgusting shit

1232
05:45:48,650 --> 05:46:08,790
pie that they shit in and then put it in the oven it's Comcast is better damn yeah it's a it's a

1233
05:46:08,790 --> 05:46:30,040
joke just make your own pie that's all right gross let's go I could sit here and talk about how

1234
05:46:30,599 --> 05:46:37,099
much I'm not a fan of cox and Comcast and I've said it a thousand times for even people that

1235
05:46:37,099 --> 05:46:43,400
might be new here I would pay triple if any of you guys work for Verizon or you know somebody

1236
05:46:43,400 --> 05:46:51,029
that works in Verizon management tell them I would pay quadruple what they are offering right now

1237
05:46:51,029 --> 05:47:12,409
for their fiber if I could just have it rich streamer no I'm do I don't think you understand

1238
05:47:14,419 --> 05:47:21,080
of the Fios internet from there was a package a while ago I'm not sure it might have been a

1239
05:47:21,080 --> 05:47:29,990
promotional thing but this shit was $39.99 for a symmetrical 35 35 connection I think that's

1240
05:47:29,990 --> 05:47:42,860
correct but but like I just can I have that one the ship was $40 a month 35 35 is all I need

1241
05:47:43,580 --> 05:47:53,110
I mean if I wanted to bump it up to like have a little bit more download whatever but still

1242
05:47:53,110 --> 05:48:01,419
that's really really pretty damn good certain streamers have had almost as many issues on

1243
05:48:01,419 --> 05:48:10,060
Verizon but has it was it fiber was it Verizon Fios to the home Verizon DSL and whatever internet

1244
05:48:10,060 --> 05:48:17,110
probably sucks asshole their fiber connection is from my understanding it's one of the best

1245
05:48:17,110 --> 05:48:38,259
connections in the country well fiber is dedicated line yeah well that's what I mean

1246
05:48:39,139 --> 05:48:50,250
Fios is amazing only thing I miss from DC my family has files it's amazing yeah

1247
05:48:50,250 --> 05:48:53,209
tell the pistachio ice cream story again

1248
05:48:58,459 --> 05:49:03,419
Fios and DC is amazing that's all I hear all I hear is yeah files is just incredible files

1249
05:49:03,419 --> 05:49:12,169
just like the best I actually um the the guy that's that's been producing a lot of the events and who

1250
05:49:12,169 --> 05:49:19,349
will continue to um for the streams and stuff said that he had files as well and he told me

1251
05:49:19,349 --> 05:49:26,950
that over I believe it was two years the connection went down once and it was because it was a

1252
05:49:26,950 --> 05:49:33,080
scheduled maintenance for like four hours they just were like upgrading the network

1253
05:49:33,080 --> 05:49:37,400
and it's the only time it ever went down in two years and I'm just sitting there going just

1254
05:49:37,479 --> 05:49:42,680
Verizon like just and then and then here's the sad part of this

1255
05:49:43,479 --> 05:49:46,840
Verizon recently has decided that they're pulling out of the west coast

1256
05:49:48,409 --> 05:49:52,889
Verizon is not going to expand anymore they're pulling out of the west coast I believe they

1257
05:49:52,889 --> 05:49:57,930
sold off all their stuff to a couple of other companies out here somebody correct me if I'm

1258
05:49:57,930 --> 05:50:11,029
wrong the frontier I think that's right they sold off all their stuff to frontier it's taken them

1259
05:50:11,029 --> 05:50:23,720
yep see that's just so sad but the good thing is I will be on an actual fiber connection

1260
05:50:24,810 --> 05:50:42,819
in a couple months depending no I'm staying in Vegas not going back to Boston he's going back

1261
05:50:47,560 --> 05:50:55,400
and I I have asked and it is true fiber it's not one of those fiber to the neighborhood and then

1262
05:50:55,400 --> 05:51:02,279
copper to the street and then copper to the house and then coaxial to your modem no no no no this

1263
05:51:02,279 --> 05:51:17,610
is the real deal what the hell is this suppose that united bank offers to lend you ten thousand

1264
05:51:17,610 --> 05:51:24,020
dollars for one year at a nominal annual rate of eight percent but you must make interest payments

1265
05:51:24,020 --> 05:51:27,220
at the end of each quarter and then pay off the ten thousand principal amount for the end of the

1266
05:51:27,220 --> 05:51:40,709
year what is the effective annual rate on the loan I don't care I don't why do somebody will

1267
05:51:40,709 --> 05:51:47,049
answer that for you apparently I don't know it's not gonna be me don't do it don't do the math

1271
05:52:07,080 --> 05:52:15,900
want to play some of them are a little less polished than others and I was looking at that one

1272
05:52:15,900 --> 05:52:27,130

1285
05:53:56,330 --> 05:54:01,049
forgot it somehow it was in a bag on a counter and I didn't take it or I didn't have that there was

1286
05:54:01,049 --> 05:54:07,740
some reason why and I didn't have a costume and I felt really bad about it and one of my teachers

1287
05:54:07,740 --> 05:54:14,470
at the time don't know what her name was but god bless her soul because she pulled me out of the

05:54:14,470 --> 05:54:20,869
class and said hey because you know I mean I'm upset I wanted to be the red ranger hey okay I

1291
05:54:40,970 --> 05:54:49,380

1292
05:54:49,380 --> 05:55:00,009
I have ever seen and I want nothing more than to not ever wear this so I put it on and then I walked

06:05:11,209 --> 06:05:15,930
at an ice cream parlor and we have soft strawberry it's the best can i send you a quart of it please

1350
06:05:15,930 --> 06:05:24,819
say yes i don't accept anything in the mail i have a p.o box uh maybe i will have a p.o box

1351
06:05:25,540 --> 06:05:34,840
in like a decade and that means no send ice cream in the mail what you mean to say is can i send you

1352
06:05:34,840 --> 06:05:47,099
flavored milk but no i don't have any plans ever to do any type of send me stuff like p.o box or

1353
06:05:47,099 --> 06:05:54,090
anything p.o box is free content it's that i you guys realize that that p.o box wherever it is

1354
06:05:55,419 --> 06:06:02,619
it would get so full and i would not keep up with it and i would get calls from this post office

1355
06:06:03,180 --> 06:06:10,740
saying hey dickhead you have a p.o box here we are you have boxes here that are taking up the

1356
06:06:10,740 --> 06:06:25,020
whole room we don't have room for any of this stuff you need to come get this stuff honestly

1357
06:06:25,020 --> 06:06:28,220
just completely honest it's just something i just don't really want to keep up with

1358
06:06:30,439 --> 06:06:40,810
because it's hard enough to do anything else just my complete honest opinion on it but thank you

1359
06:06:40,810 --> 06:06:46,950
for the milk potentially thank you permanent marks for the 300 bits i'll buy you another sonic

1360
06:06:46,950 --> 06:06:53,500
corndog if you let my family go well that's i know this is fake because sonic corndogs are gross

1361
06:06:53,500 --> 06:07:00,709
and i would never order one so you're implying that i've eaten one already that's how you know

1362
06:07:00,709 --> 06:07:17,540
that's a lie how do i know because i've had sonic before i've had i've eaten all this i've eaten

1363
06:07:17,540 --> 06:07:29,580
bit sonic a few times and every time i just go i should have just went to wendy's i've been told

1364
06:07:29,580 --> 06:07:34,700
you don't order food from sonic you order the drinks from sonic and like wow you're doing it

1365
06:07:34,700 --> 06:07:47,259
wrong you're ordering food from sonic doing it wrong sonic has good burgers though i've never

1366
06:07:47,259 --> 06:07:56,470
had a sonic burger i've had a bunch of their other stuff that was not very good fuck you jeremy

1367
06:07:56,470 --> 06:08:10,330
so my own girlfriend is in here fuck you jeremy sonic is great oh my god sonic tater tots are good

1368
06:08:10,330 --> 06:08:15,770
every time all right and it's when i say every time i mean the two times that i've been to sonic

1369
06:08:15,770 --> 06:08:27,500
and ordered those items the cheddar tater tots were cold soggy and unappetizing they all came up

1370
06:08:28,060 --> 06:08:37,220
at once when you picked up one tater tot all 30 of them came up at the same time they were like

1371
06:08:37,220 --> 06:08:49,529
shitty nachos i used to work there and i wouldn't trust the drinks either to be honest

1372
06:08:50,490 --> 06:09:04,919
look if you put a blindfold on me and you put me in a car and you said we're gonna go get food

1373
06:09:04,919 --> 06:09:10,279
i'm not telling you where oh okay and you drove and you took the blindfold off and we were in a

1374
06:09:10,279 --> 06:09:19,979
sonic parking lot okay i sure i'll eat here but i'm not going to go out of my way to go to a sonic

1375
06:09:20,540 --> 06:09:31,959
ever again i would eat it and i'd be like all right i ate it that was all right that was okay

1376
06:09:32,200 --> 06:09:36,599
i guess it was like kind of blah it's good whatever it's food it's worth it i guess

1377
06:09:41,259 --> 06:09:47,819
auto is sleepy and sloppy and loves tater tots so what you're like speaking

1378
06:09:56,360 --> 06:10:05,560
anyways thank you uh thank you spooky spitfire for the 250 germ i literally got her at the end

1379
06:10:05,560 --> 06:10:12,279
of the stream when you were showing auto so it was worth it also i just got to the old hunter's dlc

1380
06:10:13,259 --> 06:10:17,259
and there is a boom hammer hunter with more health than the cleric beast and i don't know

1381
06:10:17,259 --> 06:10:31,509
how to feel about that it's tough that first area in the dlc those guys are no joke blood

1382
06:10:31,509 --> 06:10:37,740
boys dlc by the way is the best dlc of any video game that's ever been made it is the best there's

1383
06:10:37,740 --> 06:10:54,900
a there's one or two small missteps but you dlc is a misstep by a design choice so come on but

1384
06:10:54,900 --> 06:11:06,939
that's wrong well what it is is it's adding here listen you make a video game and you add dlc okay

1385
06:11:06,939 --> 06:11:13,340
fine but a lot of times that dlc ends up costing almost as much as the original game did for

1386
06:11:15,060 --> 06:11:26,360
70 to 80 percent less content you'll spend like 30 40 bucks sometimes on some of these dlcs

1387
06:11:27,080 --> 06:11:34,459
and it doesn't add as much as you play it already in the base game but you're paying for nearly

1388
06:11:34,459 --> 06:11:48,790
like 60 70 sometimes like 75 percent of the base game that's kind of i guess now dlc i think is

1389
06:11:48,790 --> 06:11:54,470
also another one of those things that it has to exist because if you make something that people

1390
06:11:54,470 --> 06:12:06,700
really like you want to do more of that thing for the people that really like it and it gives you

1391
06:12:06,700 --> 06:12:11,779
a reason to go back and play that it's not especially in a single player sense it gives

1392
06:12:11,779 --> 06:12:19,700
you a reason to go back and play it again and experience some new stuff the sims games cost

1393
06:12:19,700 --> 06:12:35,299
like 500 for the full experience and train simulator is like 2000 wasn't there a calculation one time

1394
06:12:38,419 --> 06:12:53,590
it's 7 000 no it's not it's not seven grand but i i enjoy dlc it's just sometimes you'll

1395
06:12:54,389 --> 06:13:00,310
there's no standard of how long or what needs to be added for dlc so that's why it gets weird

1396
06:13:01,659 --> 06:13:07,479
because oh buy the season pass all right i bought the season pass you get everything for 40 dollars

1397
06:13:07,479 --> 06:13:14,580
cool but what what if you don't do like a season pass what if you just buy i want this just this

1398
06:13:14,659 --> 06:13:20,680
single thing that you came out with now oh well that's 25 dollars okay well it's an hour long

1399
06:13:20,680 --> 06:13:41,180
when are we gonna get the germa dlc it's coming out i'm not anti dlc i'm just like what do i get

1400
06:13:41,180 --> 06:13:46,180
for this and sometimes season passes are so vague you really don't even know what the hell you're

1401
06:13:46,180 --> 06:13:51,450
buying you're buying a thing that you don't even know what it exists yet it's not even like

1402
06:13:51,450 --> 06:13:55,450
pre-ordering pre-ordering game when you pre-order a game you know what the game is that you're going

1403
06:13:55,450 --> 06:14:07,180
to buy at least when you buy a season pass it's just hey something gonna show up here you don't

1404
06:14:07,180 --> 06:14:22,709
even know what it is and you know here's another part of this if you buy season pass for a game

1405
06:14:24,229 --> 06:14:28,950
and that content comes out like six seven eight months later almost probably a year later what

1406
06:14:28,950 --> 06:14:32,470
if you don't even play the game anymore what if you don't even know you don't even pay attention

1407
06:14:32,470 --> 06:14:38,580
anymore yeah i want that season pass like a year and eight months goes by and i'll say you like

1408
06:14:39,299 --> 06:14:51,659
you forgot that the game even came out that happens that happens that happens pretty often

1409
06:14:51,659 --> 06:15:01,900
i'm sure well maybe maybe that happened to me with borderlands yeah i mean a good look good

1410
06:15:01,900 --> 06:15:13,450
content is good content i will gladly pay like i have many times for dlc but by its very nature

1411
06:15:14,169 --> 06:15:22,090
it's it can be sort of predatory in a way it's like promising something that doesn't exist yet

1412
06:15:23,349 --> 06:15:27,909
especially if you sell a season pass it's kind of it's season passes is what i have the issue with

1413
06:15:27,909 --> 06:15:47,610
not like actual dlc packages that come out just it's in header it's inherently predatory it's

1414
06:15:47,610 --> 06:15:52,250
just that some dlc is actually good yeah and there are a lot of companies that do put a lot

1415
06:15:52,250 --> 06:16:13,000
of time into it they really do but where there is a yin there is a yang as they say we are no we're

1416
06:16:13,000 --> 06:16:28,970
not i thought we were done we're not done all dlc should be free see i disagree with that because

1417
06:16:29,849 --> 06:16:36,380
how do you pay the people that made it you know people that made the dlc they you have i mean

1418
06:16:36,380 --> 06:16:41,259
like the concept artists the the people that made the dungeons the people that do the character

1419
06:16:41,259 --> 06:16:45,740
design the 3d modelers the programmers like the these the people aren't working for free

1420
06:16:56,380 --> 06:17:07,900
imagine paying for games don't they get paid by a contractual basis i i am not i'm not going to speak

1421
06:17:08,779 --> 06:17:14,540
on how this works in the games industry because i have no idea and i don't want to be one of those

1422
06:17:14,540 --> 06:17:24,220
people that gives you spitballs a bunch of shit that's just not true so i don't know but thank

1423
06:17:24,220 --> 06:17:36,619
you for the 300 bits from hannah has bits hannah has a bits say i don't know if i'm i don't know

1424
06:17:36,619 --> 06:17:43,220
if i'm cheering right this is the first time i've done it i got told you don't read your sub messages

1425
06:17:43,299 --> 06:17:46,900
my sub message was talking about how i've been having a really really hard time and i was just

1426
06:17:46,900 --> 06:17:51,700
wanting to hear you say it would be okay in a reassuring voice and following you for years

1427
06:17:51,700 --> 06:17:55,380
and i'm not trying to be weird but i really wanted to get that out there before tonight ends

1428
06:17:56,020 --> 06:18:05,209
well i'll give you two parts to this if you are having a really really hard time

1429
06:18:10,020 --> 06:18:20,250
and me simply saying that it's going to be okay is going to be enough for you i really just want

1430
06:18:20,250 --> 06:18:28,680
to make sure you understand that that might not be correct and you should try to figure out what's

1431
06:18:28,680 --> 06:18:39,259
going on and also maybe seek some actual potential professional help because it's it's very easy for

1432
06:18:39,259 --> 06:18:47,529
me to do that you know what i mean but i want to make sure that you're okay that you are okay

1433
06:18:48,330 --> 06:19:02,200
and me simply saying those words is not necessarily a magic wand to do so and no it's not you're not

1434
06:19:02,200 --> 06:19:08,659
trying to be weird it's not it's not weird just make sure you're doing the necessary things

1435
06:19:08,659 --> 06:19:30,939
to make yourself feel better and get better you've been following the channel for a long time so

1436
06:19:30,939 --> 06:19:36,459
obviously i don't want people that are following this channel and that say some like stuff like

1437
06:19:36,459 --> 06:19:40,220
this sometimes i don't want you to feel terrible i don't want you to feel bad i want you to feel

1438
06:19:40,220 --> 06:19:50,659
like everything's going to be okay but just be careful putting essentially that power over here

1439
06:19:51,299 --> 06:19:57,529
because i might not actually have that kind of power and me telling you that might it's a you

1440
06:19:57,529 --> 06:20:09,290
know what i'm saying it's a weird scenario where i might not have that power but please please please

1441
06:20:09,290 --> 06:20:16,950
follow up with this if you really are having a problem in a hard time talk to the people that

1442
06:20:16,950 --> 06:20:31,189
can really help with that i wish you the best much love to you take care of yourself i'm sorry that

1443
06:20:31,189 --> 06:20:36,569
you're not having a great time but i will also say this was a two-parter where i said this part

1444
06:20:36,650 --> 06:20:46,860
here oh well i haven't said it but i'm about to regardless of that if it is if it does make you

1445
06:20:46,860 --> 06:20:53,060
happy and staying here and hanging out here makes you feel better that's good and i'm really happy

1446
06:20:53,060 --> 06:21:10,979
to hear that but that should only be a piece a small piece of that puzzle thank you so much

1447
06:21:10,979 --> 06:21:19,900
for your 300 bits your three dollars i wish you the best and please take care of yourself take

1448
06:21:19,900 --> 06:21:34,709
care moving on from that we have 500 bits from super or super tentorium super tentorium thanks

1449
06:21:34,709 --> 06:21:40,229
for the five dollars here this is my quadra request for you to play kerbal space program i

1450
06:21:40,229 --> 06:21:46,549
loaded up kerbal space program and could not figure out anything in the first 30 seconds

1451
06:21:47,189 --> 06:21:52,979
and realized that this was i was never going to learn and i exited the game in fact i can tell

1452
06:21:52,979 --> 06:21:57,220
you i mean that i'm embellishing right so let's see how much time i have in kerbal space program

1453
06:22:01,419 --> 06:22:22,709
kerbal space program let's go to games on steam l m n o p k there it is okay so i have 20 minutes

1454
06:22:23,509 --> 06:22:28,069
in kerbal space program and probably seven or eight of those minutes we're doing menu stuff

1455
06:22:28,790 --> 06:22:33,939
i probably only have about 12 to 13 minutes actually trying to make anything

1456
06:22:33,939 --> 06:22:44,950
that's embarrassing i i'm just told i'm being open with you you stopped before qrs yeah so i'm

1457
06:22:44,950 --> 06:22:48,630
not going to play kerbal space program there's plenty of people that do great hilarious fun

1458
06:22:48,630 --> 06:22:53,990
content with that game you've probably seen it a bunch before you would be very you'd be so

1459
06:22:53,990 --> 06:23:02,180
irritated watching that stream i wouldn't be able to do it i tried i put 10 minutes i put 10 i gave

1460
06:23:02,180 --> 06:23:11,959
it 12 minutes so you know i gave i gave it a shot thank you also uh death gamer thanks to the 250

1461
06:23:11,959 --> 06:23:15,720
hey germa i was wondering what happened to the modern warfare 3 grandpa vids do you still have

1462
06:23:15,720 --> 06:23:23,930
them or are they gone forever that is a machinima problem machinima i made those videos for machinima

1463
06:23:23,930 --> 06:23:30,360
so i was essentially contracted out by machinima to have them put them on machinima respawn

1464
06:23:31,540 --> 06:23:38,220
and then they just privated all of them for seemingly no reason and then machinima has now

1465
06:23:38,220 --> 06:23:53,430
been completely liquidated as a company they don't exist anymore and those videos are gone yeah so

1466
06:23:53,430 --> 06:23:59,819
i do not have access to those videos they are potentially gone forever in fact i think they

1467
06:23:59,819 --> 06:24:12,650
are gone forever which is too bad because that's that's really where i got my actual start kind of

1468
06:24:12,650 --> 06:24:18,659
gaining in viewership and having a channel that was more you know comedy oriented though that

1469
06:24:18,659 --> 06:24:25,540
first like grandpa video did so much like that i did like 12 episodes that did so much for my

1470
06:24:25,540 --> 06:24:40,740
channel that is kind of a shame that they're just gone forever but i didn't i'm not my youtube

1471
06:24:40,740 --> 06:24:49,400
channels are not under contract with machinima anymore so i have no connection to them at all

1472
06:24:55,509 --> 06:25:01,700
yes i there are still a few on my channel i still have like uh maybe three i think there's two or

1473
06:25:01,700 --> 06:25:11,159
three that i uploaded even though you really weren't supposed to i kind of got a pass on a

1474
06:25:11,159 --> 06:25:15,479
couple of them i think because they were i don't know why but i know you weren't really supposed

1475
06:25:15,479 --> 06:25:26,340
to do that but i do not have access to them currently no that is two or three computers ago

1476
06:25:27,220 --> 06:25:35,270
and those hard drives i've brought along with me but then they weren't worth putting in the new

1477
06:25:35,270 --> 06:25:42,310
computers i have two computers from that computer i didn't keep them anymore and they were hard disk

1478
06:25:42,310 --> 06:25:47,990
drives i went to full solid state those hard drives kind of ran out of gas and i didn't really want

1479
06:25:47,990 --> 06:25:56,549
to use them anymore so they're just kind of gone but thank you door cube for the 250 bits i was

1480
06:25:56,549 --> 06:25:59,990
thinking today about how this community is the first one i've ever actively participated in

1481
06:25:59,990 --> 06:26:05,380
and how i have made some friends for life here and i'm still looking forward to the day i meet an

1482
06:26:05,380 --> 06:26:10,819
