1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:08,859
Hey, let's change the game to Hitman. It's worse than Quiet Man.

2
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:21,300
Hitman. Just for fun. Everything's just for fun. Go back to Quiet- I'm sorry, but you've-

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,260
We've made the lasagna. I made it for the whole company. You have to eat this.

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,059
Like that's like I did a poll in my company. Up in the chair.

5
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,770
What do you guys want for lunch tomorrow? And 60% of the people vote for lasagna.

6
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:42,039
And then all of a sudden the truck pulls up and a fucking kiddie pool lasagna comes over here.

7
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,320
And nobody eats it. Maybe two people take like- like as if you go to a birthday party

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,359
and somebody eats one slice of the gross cake that nobody wants.

9
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,439
No, no, no. That's not happening. That's not happening in my company.

10
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:57,240
You're eating this lasagna. Because you voted for it.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,310
51%. Well, 51. They better be half lasagna.

12
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,189
What am I going to do with this lawless lasagna?

13
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,390
What am I supposed to do with lasagna?

14
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:10,950
Everybody likes lasagna. You'll eat it, right? Like you'll eat this.

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:19,209
I didn't even change- Hitman. Hitman...

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,569
I don't know. I think it'd be an hour to make a title.

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,760
Look at chat. I'm looking at chat.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
What if you're allergic to lasagna?

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,359
Well, they'd be- they'd be a gluten-free fridge with a bunch of stuff in it.

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,519
Hitman lasagna.

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,040
Hitman lasagna. How do you spell lasagna?

22
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,819
I was going to spell it phonetically.

23
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,939
La-zon-ya. Lasagna.

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,120
That's going to be called Hitman Company lasagna.

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,979
There. By the way, I mean, we're not stopping right now.

26
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,180
I just want to make sure everyone's aware.

27
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,860
Tomorrow, there's no stream tomorrow because it is Thanksgiving.

28
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,939
Happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate it.

29
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,330
We're not stopping. Don't worry. We're not stopping.

30
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,780
All right. Let's eat some fucking lasagna.

31
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,389
Wait, why am I- why am I using the controller?

32
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:44,629
I was keyboard and mouse last time.

33
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,449
He's doing the end of the stream voice.

34
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,490
Okay. So, okay.

35
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,680
But I think, right? That's how it is.

36
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:06,949
Okay. So, I think I just got angry.

37
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:08,629
I just got fucking angry looking at this.

38
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,219
Like I have to get it off the screen.

39
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,580
All right. Let's see. What do we want to try?

40
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:23,770
Let's go back here and let's try a different scenario.

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,139
Planning. I'm not playing ghost mode.

42
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,419
Absolutely not.

43
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,530
Florida suit.

44
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,840
All right. Event. Let's try- we can go here.

45
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,500
We can take- obviously, I'm taking a fish.

46
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,139
Everyone would scream at me if I didn't.

47
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,469
All right. Stream was good. See y'all later.

48
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:56,469
DM me if Quiet Man comes back.

49
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,979
You just didn't take a piece of lasagna to go.

50
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,099
Don't just leave it.

51
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:14,250
I mean, I know I'm losing half of my viewer base here

52
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,230
because I made everybody eat lasagna.

53
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,430
Okay. Well, what if it was lasagna?

54
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,149
What if half of the lasagna was like veggie lasagna

55
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:25,910
and half was like a meat-based lasagna.

56
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,750
It was cut in half. It was like a giant pizza.

57
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,870
Would you eat it then?

58
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:40,230
Split the screen.

59
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,389
But I can't play it like that.

60
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:56,740
People are leaving because you keep making the lasagna.

61
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,300
Well, that's a very, very strong reference, I think.

62
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,459
All right. Well, stop learning it.

63
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,870
So we have- look, are you going to stay now?

64
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:22,199
I'm about to throw a briefcase at somebody.

65
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,680
Isn't that extraordinarily hilarious?

66
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm leaving.

67
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,139
Sorry.

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,519
But why am I sorry?

69
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:36,759
All right.

70
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,790
So we got mission stories.

71
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,310
A perfect machine.

72
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,910
Intravenous.

73
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,269
We did this one.

74
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,959
The munchies.

75
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,019
The new army.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,480
The triumph with turbocharged.

77
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,629
I mean, this one is so strange.

78
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,149
I need to- I kind of want to know what it is.

79
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,519
The new army.

80
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,220
So that's pretty far away.

81
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,779
Can I get in the boat?

82
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:09,660
Can I drive the boat?

83
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:13,660
I don't think I can.

84
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,379
That'd be amazing.

85
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,500
Turn off the sound.

86
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,779
What, you want the quiet man experience?

87
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:33,560
All right, here we go.

88
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:36,389
I'm not going to turn off the sound.

89
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:37,509
People are probably going to come here and be like,

90
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:38,550
oh, Hitman 2, okay.

91
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:48,389
Loud man.

92
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,519
No, and I'm not doing a cheese grater to my feet.

93
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,240
I'm not turning the sound off.

94
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm not putting a cheese grater on my feet.

95
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,680
And I'm not going to turn the sound as loud as I-

96
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,120
I'm going to do the Hitman mission.

97
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,769
That is Ted Mendez.

98
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,970
One of the country's most influential military grade moneymen.

99
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,370
This must be connected to Kronstadt.

100
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,870
Okay.

101
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,810
Let's see if we can listen to what this guy said.

102
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,529
Look, dolphins.

103
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:37,399
Ted here.

104
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,199
Just returning your call before heading over to the expo building

105
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,720
to meet Knox with a new-

106
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,319
Combat Android presentation.

107
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:45,819
Okay.

108
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,519
Yeah, the stutter is kind of crazy.

109
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:49,800
Why?

110
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,839
It's because there's water.

111
00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:01,110
I don't have a 780.

112
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,829
I have a 1080.

113
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,279
I mean, my drivers might be from like 2016,

114
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,040
but it's still a 1080, god damn it.

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,399
I'm kidding.

116
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:09,879
That's a joke.

117
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,399
I have the drivers.

118
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,949
Ted Mendez.

119
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,829
A defense funding consultant with the U.S. military

120
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,829
is scheduled for a private demonstration

121
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:21,829
of a new Kronstadt robotics project.

122
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:22,329
Okay.

123
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,189
Sounds like a way to get up close and personal with what-

124
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,430
Update drivers.

125
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,370
Disguise yourself as Ted Mendez.

126
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:31,870
You got it.

127
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,340
Hey.

128
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,389
My 10- my 970 runs again.

129
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:42,669
Do I need to get drivers?

130
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:47,549
Maybe I should update my drivers on stream.

131
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:53,980
Is this guy gonna see this?

132
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:14,590
I can't get him now.

133
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,549
There's a guy behind me.

134
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:20,539
Why is this running so-

135
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:21,899
This wasn't running like this before.

136
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,379
I have to get the fucking new drivers.

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,679
I have to make these guys run the other direction.

138
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,519
I did not turn the settings down?

139
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,240
Yeah, I don't know why.

140
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,039
I think it's definitely a driver problem.

141
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:09,049
Quick dump in the water.

142
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:10,169
Water, water, water, water, water.

143
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:15,289
Oh, fuck.

144
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:35,100
Turn the water off.

145
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,659
I dislike this stream.

146
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:42,860
It's not quiet, man.

147
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,539
Okay.

148
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,240
Save it and get indoors before my computer breaks.

149
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,220
Hitman.

150
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,779
It's time.

151
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,720
I have nothing.

152
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,519
I don't know what to say.

153
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,559
Approach to reception.

154
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:10,879
Here we go.

155
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,240
We're gonna do this fun mission.

156
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,279
Mr. Mendez.

157
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,720
Good to see you, sir.

158
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,919
The demonstration is scheduled to take place on the upper floors.

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
Look at the executive floor.

160
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,799
Please feel free to use the stairs right over there.

161
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,559
He finally ran out of jokes.

162
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,460
Excuse me.

163
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,419
Oh, I got so many.

164
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,860
Can you tell me where to go, please?

165
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,460
It's just up these stairs.

166
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,419
It's just some of the-

167
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,779
I run a joke library up there,

168
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:31,899
and a lot of the books are overdue,

169
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,419
so I'm just kind of waiting for them to be returned.

170
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,480
This is running like dog shit.

171
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,519
It wasn't doing this before.

172
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,029
Hold on.

173
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:55,789
Let me just go get the driver.

174
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,879
I'm gonna open Quiet Man up in the background

175
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,840
while we get the driver.

176
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,090
I don't know why it's doing this.

177
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,610
It's like unplayable, actually.

178
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,129
I don't know why it's doing it now.

179
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:12,080
Oh, I'll get it quick.

180
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,960
I have 10,000 down.

181
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,600
Oh, fuck.

182
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,120
Wait, will this turn off the stream?

183
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,950
It shouldn't, right?

184
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:27,289
No, is this gonna turn off the stream?

185
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,399
All right, I'll be right back if it does.

186
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,360
This one just came out.

187
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,000
Optimize for Hitman.

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
It actually is.

189
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,759
It actually is.

190
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,039
This one that came out like a week ago.

191
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:47,759
All right, let's get it.

192
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,440
Oh, hopefully it's the right one.

193
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:51,769
Turn the face cam on.

194
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:52,889
I don't have a webcam.

195
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't have a webcam plugged in.

196
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,389
That's all right.

197
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:00,750
It's already done downloading.

198
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,710
I'm ready.

199
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,580
That's okay.

200
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:13,340
I have 10,000 to plug in a webcam.

201
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:16,299
Lies.

202
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,019
All right, I hope this doesn't turn off OBS.

203
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,779
If not, I'm gonna press the button and come right back.

204
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,539
But I cannot play like that.

205
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:23,659
It's just, it's not gonna happen.

206
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,700
Here we go.

207
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,899
Yes, I'd like to install the drivers.

208
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:38,679
Hey, let's put this up.

209
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,080
There we go.

210
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,960
Look, I'll be right back.

211
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,259
That was a virus noise?

212
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:43,820
No, it wasn't.

213
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
That was a weird installing noise.

214
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,460
Don't install the GeForce Experience.

215
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,779
I don't.

216
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,860
I just get the driver and I say, no, thank you.

217
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,500
All right, 55%.

218
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:01,470
75%.

219
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,740
Guys, I mean, this just proves that everyone says,

220
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,419
upgrade your PC, upgrade your PC.

221
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:15,980
I mean, I have a dual core Celeron processor from like 2008 or 2007.

222
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,059
So it's still good and it still works perfectly fine.

223
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,649
Checking system compatibility.

224
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:30,009
I said it's compatible.

225
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:32,169
Just get it so I don't have to deal with the Hitman issue.

226
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,370
Come on.

227
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,570
I got hungry people here.

228
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,740
I got hungry customers here.

229
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,629
I just went in the back and I'm out of pizza.

230
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:47,480
There's no more pizza dough ready.

231
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
And there's like a line of people waiting for the pizza.

232
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,679
And I'm the guy, I'm the manager, running in the fucking back going like,

233
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,879
where are the fucking pizzas?

234
00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:00,809
Hurry.

235
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,450
I'm still testing my system compatibility.

236
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,009
Roll the dough out, get it in the oven, and fucking put toppings on it now.

237
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,659
Got it.

238
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:14,539
All right, here it comes.

239
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,460
I'll be right back.

240
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,700
If this stream turns off, I'll be back in two seconds.

241
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,950
49% of the restaurants want pasta.

242
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,669
Well, that's all right.

243
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,740
We'll just, we'll just, there'll be a station to the left of the pizzas

244
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,820
where you can put the fucking pizza into a blender and then it pisses out pasta.

245
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,480
I don't know, guys.

246
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,840
I'm trying to install a driver.

247
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,440
I'm trying to.

248
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,320
I don't know.

249
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,940
I don't know.

250
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,860
My stream's gonna like turn off.

251
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,139
Fucking quiet, man.

252
00:15:52,139 --> 00:16:07,159
The pizza shop is currently on fire.

253
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,279
No, we're good.

254
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,320
Then we're gonna, we're gonna get back into it.

255
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,200
We're gonna be just fine.

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,840
But correct me if I'm wrong, but the last Hitman stream I did,

257
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,120
it was not like that, right?

258
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:23,019
It happened every so often, but it wasn't a constant issue.

259
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:31,240
All right, we're going.

260
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,720
We're going.

261
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,120
It's going.

262
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,679
How do I like, I need to like turn on a webcam.

263
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,080
Do I have any webcams up here that I just plug in?

264
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,799
How do I, I dare, I, hold on.

265
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,590
All right, here's a shitty webcam that I'm gonna plug in.

266
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:56,940
Is this gonna, am I live?

267
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,179
My whole computer is flashing.

268
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,100
I think we're live still, are we?

269
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,099
But my display just got darker.

270
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:11,960
Are we, we're not live anymore?

271
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,440
Why can I not, my other monitors are off.

272
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:42,359
Oh god, curse of the quiet, man.

273
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,049
All right, it's done.

274
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,970
It's pretty much, it's just finishing up.

275
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,849
Even your PC wants to play quiet, man.

276
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,200
All right, to complete installation, restart the computer.

277
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,720
No, restart later.

278
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,609
I don't have time for this shit.

279
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:06,269
I don't have time for this shit.

280
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:07,549
All right, display.

281
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,990
Where's, what the fuck?

282
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,319
Don't, I don't, it doesn't detect any other displays.

283
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

284
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,109
Well, encoding overload.

285
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,109
Consider turning down the video settings is what OBS just said.

286
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:40,509
I'm at a 90% CPU right now.

287
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,319
I gotta get out of here.

288
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:43,880
I'll be right back.

289
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,839
I gotta go.

290
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,849
I actually have to go.

291
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:46,970
I'm at 90% CPU.

292
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,839
I'll be right back.

293
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,119
All right, let's try it.

294
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,720
Let's see what happens.

295
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:05,680
This reminds me of my favorite game, The Quiet Man.

296
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,759
If I just stayed in The Quiet Man, none of this would have happened.

297
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,680
I'm back, I'm back.

298
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm coming back.

299
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,480
Can't argue with that.

300
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,710
Here we go.

301
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:34,509
Count backwards.

302
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,880
All right, get that off the screen.

303
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,609
Let's see if it fixed it.

304
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,480
I can see chat.

305
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,519
I've restarted.

306
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,240
I got my, I got all my shit ready.

307
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm ready to go.

308
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:56,299
Let's just load where we just were.

309
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,980
And hopefully I don't, I don't run it like nine frames per second.

310
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:10,400
Why, The Quiet Man's currently trying to get captured.

311
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,480
Hey, hi guy.

312
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,319
What the fuck are you doing?

313
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:21,160
Jesus Christ.

314
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,039
Oh, hey, hey, hey everybody.

315
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:31,599
How are you?

316
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:38,299
Hey, how do I get that load game?

317
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:49,869
Quit game, load game.

318
00:20:50,430 --> 00:21:00,809
We've pushed him too hard.

319
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,559
No, I just want a better menu than Xbox One.

320
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Like I just want to load my game.

321
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:36,319
I don't have to buy my, okay, whatever.

322
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,119
I'm just going to load this.

323
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:47,920
It's under featured.

324
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,500
The one tab, it should be on the fucking first page.

325
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:05,099
It's like in Windows 8.

326
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:06,059
It is the first page.

327
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,740
But it should be on the second page too.

328
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,680
Load.

329
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,880
Okay, God.

330
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:12,410
Go, start it.

331
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,170
Hey, welcome to the stream everybody.

332
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:20,569
I was playing The Quiet Man.

333
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:22,009
We were making lasagna references.

334
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,569
And now I'm angry playing Hitman 2.

335
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:27,849
What the fuck is going on?

336
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,329
The race is entering its final lap, 47.

337
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,160
47, the race is over.

338
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,519
Sierra will be coming off the track anytime now.

339
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,480
It fixed it.

340
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,359
It actually fixed it.

341
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:41,920
We're good.

342
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,039
Game is fixed.

343
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,200
All right.

344
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,000
Let's settle down.

345
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,640
Everyone just relax.

346
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,160
Okay.

347
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:06,779
By the way, the mission was on a timer.

348
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,039
It's not on a timer.

349
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,519
We're fine.

350
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,079
Everything's fine.

351
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:12,720
Everything's good to go.

352
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,759
Let's play Hitman 2.

353
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:21,240
Am I allowed up here?

354
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,599
Okay, go to the executive floor.

355
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,569
I'm lagging though.

356
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:27,049
I shouldn't be.

357
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:32,009
I shouldn't be lagging.

358
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,640
Not fixed.

359
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,109
Turn off this.

360
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:47,549
Are we witnessing like the death of my graphics card live?

361
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,150
Did playing The Quiet Man like break my computer actually?

362
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:10,009
Check OBS.

363
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:11,369
OBS looks okay right now.

364
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,119
Go back to quiet.

365
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,000
Live exercise in progress.

366
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,240
All right.

367
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,720
I'm gonna be careful.

368
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,119
Let's save it.

369
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:25,710
I am getting like OBS.

370
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:27,869
I streamed this in taught.

371
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,309
This is what annoys me the most.

372
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,509
I streamed this entire game.

373
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,190
The whole thing.

374
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:34,670
Every mission.

375
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:37,950
Without any like encoding issues.

376
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,150
And I didn't change any settings.

377
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,269
So what the fuck is going on?

378
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:47,390
Save scum.

379
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:56,400
You have to finish Quiet Man.

380
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,480
I'm gonna say something provocative now, Ted.

381
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
War is going out of fashion.

382
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,240
It's dirty.

383
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,319
It's just plain bad PR.

384
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:10,160
Nobody wants to exchange their children and loved ones for flags and medals anymore.

385
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,400
The glory is cursed, Ted.

386
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,279
But luckily, Kronstadt has a solution for that.

387
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,079
Imagine this.

388
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,839
Android infiltrators operating in the field.

389
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,160
Disguised, fully embedded, ready to strike at a moment's notice.

390
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:33,279
Indestructible robotic operators who can infiltrate the deepest sanctuary of any adversary.

391
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,119
Quiet Man's not still running in the background.

392
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,029
A surgical tool.

393
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,109
An army of them.

394
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,069
Fully equipped Android medics.

395
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,670
Seeking out wounded servicemen and injured civilians.

396
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,829
Bringing them to safety.

397
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:53,069
Or patching them up dead in there.

398
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:58,109
Android pilots delivering payloads deep inside enemy territory.

399
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:00,349
So picture of target dummy.

400
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:02,190
And minimal collateral damage.

401
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:03,710
All right, Mendez.

402
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,150
It's very straightforward.

403
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,190
Let me show you.

404
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,549
So I have to sabotage this thing.

405
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:08,829
Any of the pictures on the desk.

406
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,029
Then I use the scanner to upload the biometric data.

407
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,390
And Pallas will do the rest.

408
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,190
Target acquired.

409
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,420
WB.

410
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,700
So this thing is shooting.

411
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,200
Okay.

412
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,039
So how am I going to turn this thing around and have it shoot everybody?

413
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,799
Annually feeding it biometric data.

414
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,480
This is still a prototype.

415
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,839
This is a pivotal moment.

416
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,519
No, there's no way it's still running.

417
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,640
I restarted my computer.

418
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,440
I had to turn the stream on.

419
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Pallas is entirely full crew.

420
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,480
There ain't anything else running.

421
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,599
Is the pic a photo?

422
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,720
What's the holdup, Mendez?

423
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,390
Picture of target dummy.

424
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,269
Picture of target.

425
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:42,990
I need a picture.

426
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,869
I need a picture of you.

427
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:47,579
So I need to get a picture of him first.

428
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,140
I may have missed my opportunity here.

429
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,549
All right.

430
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:52,430
Target dummy C.

431
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:56,079
Let's do them all at the same time.

432
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,990
There's no way it's running in the background.

433
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,789
I know.

434
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:21,559
I just think how much more we can accomplish together.

435
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,160
My brain's your money.

436
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,720
The sky's the limit here, my friend.

437
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:27,319
I don't know.

438
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,559
Maybe I'm old fashioned.

439
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,480
I still prefer the human touch.

440
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
You're part of an old institution.

441
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,920
If this is running in the background, there's no fucking way.

442
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,240
Hold on.

443
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,880
Wait, wait, wait.

444
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:49,920
Five?

445
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:54,960
No, no, no, no.

446
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,880
I've restarted the computer.

447
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,680
No, there's no way.

448
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,299
No.

449
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,380
And you prefer the traditional approach.

450
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,500
I respect that.

451
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,700
It is like running like shit.

452
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,660
What happened to my computer?

453
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,500
This is the future you're looking at.

454
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,420
Autonomous synthetic systems will entirely remove human agents.

455
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,539
What does five mean?

456
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:22,279
I guarantee this thing will absolutely murder anything you put it up against.

457
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,559
Sounds promising.

458
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,559
So, Mr. Mendez, impressive so far?

459
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,359
It is pretty impressive.

460
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,720
So let me find a picture of you and shoot you.

461
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,119
Let me show you our on-site robotics lab.

462
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,039
It's small, but state of the art.

463
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:32,759
And it's fully mobile.

464
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,599
Don't hit a new PC in the meeting room.

465
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,710
Check HW.

466
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,910
No, I can see my CPU.

467
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,420
I have no idea.

468
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,619
So as part of the deal, Cronstadt will throw in one deployment cell per five.

469
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:51,500
I haven't been able to lock in and pay attention.

470
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,019
I really should just go back and play quiet, man.

471
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:02,329
Are you, sir?

472
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,410
Yeah, my computer is fucked up.

473
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,670
My CPU is being overloaded right now.

474
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:16,750
I have no answer for this.

475
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:22,799
My CPU is being overloaded now.

476
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,470
I need a computer doctor.

477
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:45,019
Check OBS to see if it's using CPU or GPU encoding.

478
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:46,940
The driver update probably caused it to get switched.

479
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,960
I was just playing.

480
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,079
I was just playing.

481
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,069
The quiet fan.

482
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,680
No, no, everything's fine.

483
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,000
No, it looks fine.

484
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:19,660
Maybe something to be...

485
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,299
No, I played in this exact mission.

486
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:26,220
I was in the same exact spot not even a week ago.

487
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,579
And this wasn't happening.

488
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:32,009
It's unfortunate that this is kind of taking over the stream right now.

489
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:34,269
This is bad.

490
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,240
This is real bad.

491
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:46,829
Fuck.

492
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:55,690
Yeah, it's on H.264.

493
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,329
I just looked.

494
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,200
It is...

495
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,799
I can't...

496
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,500
Oh, no, I'm just sad.

497
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:23,549
The stream is a mess leaving.

498
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,029
I'm sorry.

499
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:28,750
I did not expect my CPU to overload and overheat and get all fucked up.

500
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,039
It was kind of funny at first.

501
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,720
No, I'm actually just kind of sad about it.

502
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,690
I'm going to reload here.

503
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:48,890
I'm going to change this.

504
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,680
Clean out the dust.

505
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
The inside is pristine.

506
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,039
There's no dust in there at all.

507
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,500
I'm not going to go back a little further.

508
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:11,819
Oh, I'm so defeated right now.

509
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:15,180
Because Italics just had major computer problems.

510
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,299
Italics's computer was smoking and almost lit on fire.

511
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:23,660
And now my CPU is fucking going crazy.

512
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:24,960
Huh?

513
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,000
Why?

514
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:28,059
Why are we cursed?

515
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:39,529
No, I'm going to go back here.

516
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,990
I'm going to go to...

517
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,269
Because I'm sorry I wasn't able to completely engross myself and pay attention to that.

518
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:53,150
My mind's been somewhere else, as you are very well aware.

519
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,650
So let's...

520
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,529
I'm going to do like this one.

521
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,880
I need to get like a picture of him, but I just didn't do it, unfortunately.

522
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:19,599
Hold on.

523
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm going to find a photo.

524
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,190
Yeah, I'm sorry, everybody.

525
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,589
I'm sorry that technical problems have taken the stream over once again.

526
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:41,710
Picture of him in here?

527
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,910
Is there a photo of him in here?

528
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:47,630
Okay, I can do it.

529
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,990
Now I have to go back to quiet.

530
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,859
All right, where's that demonstration?

531
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,759
Right here.

532
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,680
All right, I'm back.

533
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,639
And I have something for you.

534
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,679
Go stand over there, buddy.

535
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,130
All right, here we go.

536
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:27,690
I'm going to get him.

537
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,090
This isn't less lagging than it was last time?

538
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:40,730
Yeah, but last time I was not getting encoding errors,

539
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,650
because I can look at my CPU right now.

540
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,170
It's going way harder than it was last time.

541
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:58,250
Yeah, this is all turned off and down and everything.

542
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:58,809
It's not this.

543
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,480
Yeah, task manager is there's nothing there.

544
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,760
Turn V-Sync off.

545
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,110
It was already.

546
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,909
Was it off before?

547
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,760
That like made it worse.

548
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,159
Bet three.

549
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,360
Thanks for the five community subs.

550
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,960
Switch to the other controller.

551
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,239
Well, I have to turn the stream off again.

552
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,079
I really don't want to like troubleshoot live here

553
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,800
and like, oh, I'm going to turn the stream off back on streams off back on.

554
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,000
I'll just deal with it for now.

555
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,440
It's very straightforward.

556
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,079
Let me show you.

557
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,639
I just pick any of the pictures on the desk.

558
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,320
I think we're going to scan it to upload the biometric data

559
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,679
and Palace will be the rest.

560
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:58,519
Obviously, the final system won't rely on you manually feeding it.

561
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,039
Unplug my webcam.

562
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,960
No, it's not that still a prototype.

563
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,599
This is a pivotal moment in modern.

564
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,039
Yeah, Palace is entirely.

565
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
All you need is to pick a photo.

566
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,039
But what's the hold up?

567
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,039
Mendez just scan one of the pictures.

568
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,960
All right, let's do it.

569
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,000
Hey, look, I have a picture here.

570
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,159
I wonder whose picture this is photo of Robert Knox.

571
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:37,289
Knox down now for the it's that easy.

572
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,469
I mean, I press the button.

573
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,829
Wouldn't they come over to me and be like, hey,

574
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:56,989
what the hell did you just do anything to do with this?

575
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,989
Yeah, you, Mr.

576
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,750
Oh, come on.

577
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,429
He's not hold on.

578
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:06,349
Wait, I stayed here for too long.

579
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,219
Really?

580
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:08,539
Okay.

581
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:14,400
Did I actually just get caught?

582
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,829
I was thinking that guy's going to get shot in the back of the head.

583
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,070
There's new settings in the game.

584
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:29,130
Really?

585
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:37,360
I mean, I don't see anything that's different from last time.

586
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:46,590
I don't see anything different.

587
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,409
It's running better now.

588
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:49,610
We'll see.

589
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,170
We'll deal with it.

590
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,550
We.

591
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,360
It was doing that before, but not as hard as that.

592
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:02,090
A new option that I can't change.

593
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,460
All right, let's do let's get rid of the do another mission.

594
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:13,960
So this is I can't do this one now, but maybe I can do this one intravenous.

595
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,050
Do the quiet man mission.

596
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:23,019
Failing hard drive.

597
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,260
I don't know.

598
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,420
I do.

599
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,059
I brought a fish.

600
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:31,420
I didn't even bring my actual tools.

601
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:42,880
I hope German doesn't get upset from streams like these.

602
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,280
I do.

603
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,880
I do.

604
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,800
But not at like anyone in particular, right?

605
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,650
It's not like I'm angry with you guys or anything.

606
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,690
Like I can't believe this.

607
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,659
How do I get that?

608
00:38:57,659 --> 00:38:58,940
Just that kind of sucks.

609
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,239
You know, Hey, what's up?

610
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,199
It's having fun.

611
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,400
And now I have to like live troubleshoot computer problem.

612
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,840
Why is there like a dinosaur over here?

613
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,980
No, I'm good.

614
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,300
I'm good.

615
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,800
Where's the T Rex?

616
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:20,380
Is this lady?

617
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:23,239
Holy shit.

618
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,920
You weigh like 5000 pounds.

619
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,559
The record I voted for quiet, man.

620
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,260
Yeah, but I would have run into it eventually.

621
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,300
So better now than ever, you know what I mean?

622
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,260
Better now than never.

623
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:43,980
Hey, how'd you know I'm bald?

624
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:52,239
Can I go through here?

625
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,280
I'm allowed to go through this way, but let's see.

626
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,010
I probably should put his outfit on.

627
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:17,119
Can you be around better off than on?

628
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,170
No, you have a key.

629
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:22,360
Wait, you got a key on you.

630
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,280
You have a gun, but you don't.

631
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm gonna give a key.

632
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:33,659
All right, come with me.

633
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,139
That should at least give me access to this next part.

634
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,039
Better quiet than hit, man.

635
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,150
Yay.

636
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,409
Ghost mode has more optimization.

637
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,619
You know, and I'm sure it does.

638
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,639
I should have a broken neck counter.

639
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,159
Ooh, I'm going to bring him over here.

640
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,360
I can't.

641
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,840
He's fine.

642
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,440
No one's going to give a shit.

643
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:18,619
Why can I not?

644
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,070
Why was I grayed out?

645
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:27,579
All right, open this from the inside so I can run out there if I need to.

646
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,440
Hornets are back.

647
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,280
I've been great.

648
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:56,599
Can I get in front of the camera?

649
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:09,920
That's a nice camera.

650
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,360
Sir, can you please get out of there?

651
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,119
Body found?

652
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,079
Who found that body?

653
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:22,860
I'm trespassing.

654
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,420
I'm trespassing.

655
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,300
I'm trespassing here.

656
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:26,139
I'm supposed to be security.

657
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:27,980
What, mall security is not allowed back here?

658
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,000
We might have a situation.

659
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:46,599
Someone just got an ad.

660
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:47,480
All right, let's fish this guy.

661
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,400
How are you?

662
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:51,789
What?

663
00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:00,170
I just beat the shit out of this guy.

664
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:00,969
And he got right back up.

665
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:03,440
All right, I need a place to dump him.

666
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,219
This way.

667
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,500
Come with me.

668
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:20,940
Quiet Man versus Sneak Man.

669
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,119
Quiet Man doesn't kill.

670
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,119
What, you're assuming I didn't kill all those guys?

671
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,639
All right, so I need to go that way.

672
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:47,119
In there.

673
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:52,079
All right, bye.

674
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,170
All right, here we go.

675
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,530
Medical tent.

676
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,090
Story revealing itself.

677
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:03,949
Let's just say she's got a bad case of intermittent explosive disorder.

678
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,949
She's got intermittent explosive diarrhea.

679
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:15,230
Now he has to deal with this guy suffering from urinary retention.

680
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:17,550
Not his day.

681
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:22,670
Let's just hope he doesn't somehow screw up the revitalization procedure on Ms. Knox.

682
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,050
No, it's just a simple injection.

683
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,929
But given his track record these past few days.

684
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:30,969
Well, at least we know who's buying us beer tonight.

685
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:31,929
Think that's the truth.

686
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,880
Okay, so.

687
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,519
So, it seems Sierra Knox has jumped on the revitalization bandwagon

688
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:42,239
and is scheduled for an injection of some sort.

689
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:44,719
The doctor who is supposed to help her with the procedure.

690
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,480
Okay, so I gotta get in here.

691
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,599
There's a doctor.

692
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,440
I'm gonna turn into this doctor and I'm gonna poison.

693
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,210
Can I sprint through?

694
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,449
If I sprint as fast as I fucking can, can I get through?

695
00:44:57,449 --> 00:45:00,650
I heard him arguing with that Kronstadt lawyer earlier.

696
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,329
No, didn't have any luck.

697
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:04,730
Once he's done with that other driver, he'll just have to use the-

698
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:05,449
Oh, I'm allowed back here.

699
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:05,949
Nevermind.

700
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:13,579
I thought they were gonna be like,

701
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:14,860
Sir, you can't go back there.

702
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,500
You're not allowed.

703
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,900
Mr. Durant, I'll ask you to get a move on.

704
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,579
Sierra Knox coming next for a post race.

705
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:26,360
I don't want to keep her waiting.

706
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,119
Surely you must be able to-

707
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:30,519
That's it.

708
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,239
I can throw him in there.

709
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:38,780
Mr. Durant, you've inhaled around a gallon of water by now.

710
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,980
All right, how do I imitate his voice?

711
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:01,480
Hey, don't go in the closet.

712
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,469
How are we doing?

713
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,909
Yeah, yeah, relax, Tuck.

714
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,230
I know you've got Sierra Knox coming in for that fancy-

715
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:07,949
That was yest in time.

716
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,030
I'm doing my best here.

717
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:10,989
Oh shit, I need poison.

718
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:14,190
I need poison.

719
00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:15,949
I don't have any poison.

720
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,090
Uh-oh.

721
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,389
Where can I get some poison?

722
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:20,269
Poison?

723
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:21,150
No, that's a sink.

724
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:23,210
Poisonous sink?

725
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,710
Medical staff only, I'm allowed in here.

726
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,750
Here we go, we got poison.

727
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,829
Lethal poison jar.

728
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:41,679
Ugh.

729
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,599
Okay, find a key or a crowbar?

730
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,599
Why don't I find a key or a crowbar?

731
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,730
Call Sierra to emergency.

732
00:46:55,289 --> 00:47:00,219
I'm so happy to see you.

733
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:02,539
I'm guessing you're here to replace Dr. Sorensen.

734
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:04,380
I forget your name, sorry.

735
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,260
Dr. Reaper.

736
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,179
Ah, yeah, of course.

737
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:09,260
All the medics look alike.

738
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,219
Find a key or a crowbar?

739
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:11,179
Why do I need to find a key?

740
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,420
I'll prepare for her arrival.

741
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,480
Dr. Reaper.

742
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,409
All right, well, there's a key over here.

743
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,550
Okay.

744
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,170
Fucking frames.

745
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:29,469
Okay.

746
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:30,829
So...

747
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,289
Where is this, uh...

748
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:34,809
There's a medical cabinet here, but...

749
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:36,170
Oh, there it is.

750
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:38,210
Open!

751
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:44,670
It's a wrench.

752
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,070
Get rid of the current patient.

753
00:47:51,869 --> 00:48:00,570
Can I stab him in the neck?

754
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,760
How am I gonna get rid of this guy?

755
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:06,559
Illegal?

756
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:10,269
I don't have anything to throw at him.

757
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:14,590
It'll be all right.

758
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:27,480
Okay.

759
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,440
Call Sierra from...

760
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,000
No, wait, wait, wait.

761
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,400
Hold on.

762
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,519
Do I need to poison the drip?

763
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:31,960
Let me save it here.

764
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:37,440
There's already a...

765
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,800
Yeah, that's the doctor.

766
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:51,789
Blood is suspect.

767
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:54,750
Sierra Knox should be on her way to the emergency area.

768
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:56,730
Come on down.

769
00:48:58,119 --> 00:48:59,079
So, poison the drip?

770
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:00,119
Right now?

771
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,949
I'm gonna do it right now.

772
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:14,650
Is there anything...

773
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:15,130
What's in here?

774
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,239
Okay, put it in the line.

775
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:20,039
So it's in the line now.

776
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:20,539
Come on in.

777
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,429
Dr. President Sleeper.

778
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:35,099
Oh, am I gonna give her a haircut too?

779
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,300
Stop killing people.

780
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,860
I didn't...

781
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,139
I just had to...

782
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:43,739
Well, yeah, I'm sorry.

783
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,619
I have nothing there.

784
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:48,059
I have nothing to combat that.

785
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,949
That's a pretty good excuse though.

786
00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:07,440
Does nobody find it weird that the back of your head is branded?

787
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:10,800
Well, I mean, you could always just talk about how

788
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,690
the tattoo you got when you were younger

789
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:17,710
because you're such a fan of the Hitman games.

790
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,539
Dr. Lasagna.

791
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,559
Everybody makes that joke because it's a funny joke.

792
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,280
Can I tell her to come in?

793
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:31,760
Get in here.

794
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,320
I'm ready.

795
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:35,639
You.

796
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:37,079
Right there.

797
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,300
Let's go.

798
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:42,079
Ms. Knox, I'm ready for you.

799
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,079
God, I hope I don't break a leg or something.

800
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:46,320
Okay.

801
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,619
Thanks for the input, lady.

802
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:55,070
Really great GTA pedestrian thing to say.

803
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:04,119
Ms. Knox, come on in.

804
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:05,869
Have a seat and relax.

805
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:06,989
So, what's on the menu?

806
00:51:06,989 --> 00:51:09,710
Oh, can you just get out of the way for me?

807
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,469
Have you ever heard of personal space?

808
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:11,949
I promise.

809
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:12,429
Shut up.

810
00:51:12,429 --> 00:51:16,079
Once I'm done, you won't feel a thing.

811
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:16,400
All right.

812
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,360
Sit in that chair.

813
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,119
So, what's on the menu anyway, doc?

814
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:24,110
Mostly floral, extracts, hemlock, belladonna, aconite.

815
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:26,349
It's designed to be fast and efficient.

816
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,230
Fast and efficient.

817
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:28,909
Changed disguises.

818
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:30,510
Wait, belladonna?

819
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,349
Isn't that poisonous?

820
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:32,909
Yes.

821
00:51:32,909 --> 00:51:34,269
Should I beat this round?

822
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:34,750
I'm not.

823
00:51:35,389 --> 00:51:36,349
Just relax.

824
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:37,309
It'll be over soon.

825
00:51:44,989 --> 00:51:45,550
Hey, doc.

826
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,909
Hope we don't need you today, huh?

827
00:51:47,789 --> 00:51:50,170
How is she going to die?

828
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:51,769
Choke?

829
00:51:51,769 --> 00:51:52,409
Puke?

830
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,530
Or just roll over in the chair?

831
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,489
What do you think?

832
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:55,369
Hey, you know what?

833
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,130
I do feel refreshed.

834
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:57,929
Thanks, doc.

835
00:51:57,929 --> 00:51:59,849
My pleasure, Ms. Knox.

836
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:05,449
Is she going to puke?

837
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:06,889
Oh, god.

838
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:08,969
I got to call my dermatologist back.

839
00:52:08,969 --> 00:52:10,170
Don't worry.

840
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,929
It'll be over soon, Ms. Knox.

841
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,519
Both targets down.

842
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:20,119
Well done, 47.

843
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:22,280
Head for an exit and we'll speak again soon.

844
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:24,809
Clean.

845
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:29,239
Clean.

846
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:30,679
Oh, there's an exit right here.

847
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:33,079
Excellent.

848
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:46,239
Spotless.

849
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:59,000
Okay, now it's time to just go on an absolute insanity run.

850
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:11,340
Okay, so let's replay the mission.

851
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:15,840
Actually, let's do next and see what we unlocked.

852
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,000
Stands, toilet, sniper rifle, stands.

853
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:22,139
Okay, cool.

854
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:31,869
All right, so now let's go back to the menu.

855
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:34,440
Challenges, a man in the sea,

856
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,920
assassin with a fish trophy.

857
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:43,500
Sands.

858
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:45,070
All right, let's go back.

859
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,699
I want to replay the mission.

860
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:51,980
Re-plan mission for a second.

861
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:58,380
I want to bring in to the toilets.

862
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:13,719
Okay, let's start at the...

863
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:17,469
I start with this costume on.

864
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:18,269
Dolphin fountain.

865
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:24,349
I guess I'll start in the stands.

866
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:29,500
Start at the public toilet.

867
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:36,409
I want to see how fast I can eliminate both targets and get up.

868
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:42,489
Don't forget, the secret of endurance racing is to keep that car going until the end.

869
00:54:42,489 --> 00:54:44,170
He's getting into character here.

870
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,719
All right, hold on.

871
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:48,039
Wait a minute.

872
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:48,280
Can I...

873
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,579
Let me see if I can do this.

874
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,059
What?

875
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,019
Oh, I got him.

876
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:25,260
What?

877
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,690
Holy shit.

878
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:36,170
Nobody...

879
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,300
No, nobody...

880
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,820
What about the ones that are driving in now?

881
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,530
They're gonna smash into it?

882
00:55:56,969 --> 00:56:00,519
No, I don't think they can hit it.

883
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:12,920
Wait a minute.

884
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,849
That was a pretty quiet grenade.

885
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:21,369
Do the Sean B mission?

886
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:22,409
Yeah, I'll go do that.

887
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:23,130
That sounds like fun.

888
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,599
That's the patient zero, right?

889
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:33,920
Don't forget, the secret of endurance racing is to keep that car going until the end.

890
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,360
This race is not over until the clock ticks again.

891
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
Wait, let's wait.

892
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:47,679
How much time remaining?

893
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:48,960
Don't worry, folks.

894
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,559
Anything can still happen.

895
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:02,409
Fuck.

896
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,719
That guy died?

897
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,960
I'm trying to punch this guy.

898
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,760
Why can't I punch this guy?

899
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,079
All right, let's do the other mission.

900
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:40,730
Wait, hold on.

901
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:41,769
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

902
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:42,170
Hold on.

903
00:57:51,949 --> 00:57:52,349
Bird.

904
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:56,750
For newcomers to endurance races, let me remind you that this is difficult,

905
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:06,460
and it's all about which team should seize it reliably.

906
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,019
How did I...

907
00:58:11,949 --> 00:58:13,150
Two hours later.

908
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,880
No, no, no, no, no.

909
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:33,530
I was trying to throw it over.

910
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,480
Okay, elusive target.

911
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:49,579
47.

912
00:58:49,579 --> 00:58:50,139
Good morning.

913
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:54,619
Your target is Mark Faber, also known as the Undying.

914
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:59,420
A disgraced former MI5 operative currently working as a freelance assassin,

915
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:03,739
Faber has been confirmed killed by ICA agents more than a dozen times.

916
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:08,139
On every occasion, he has managed to come back from the dead.

917
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:13,800
We have confirmation that Faber has a meeting in the Miami Bayside Center

918
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,800
to review details on a new target.

919
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,360
Illusions.

920
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,920
An informant at the site has provided us with reliable intel on Faber's expected movement.

921
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,599
Hmm, he's already taken a helicopter?

922
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:25,480
This information has revealed several viable approaches.

923
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:29,000
As you know, our inside man is meeting with the target.

924
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:33,800
Acquire the right disguise, and he'll get you inside the heart of the building.

925
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,320
Up close and personal is risky, but favors the clean kill.

926
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,639
Alternatively, smuggle in a sniper rifle via briefcase.

927
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:42,199
I like that idea.

928
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:45,000
The race tower is a perfect vantage point.

929
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,559
That's what I'm doing.

930
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:47,079
Access is restricted.

931
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:48,440
Race security is high.

932
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:53,159
Get through the locked door, and time your shot perfectly.

933
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:53,639
I'll get it.

934
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:58,440
Or infiltrate through the staff entrance at the back of the building.

935
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,079
Access the second floor using the elevator shaft.

936
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:06,440
Move unseen inside the weapons demo room, and infiltrate as you see fit.

937
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,920
Act once an opportunity presents itself, or rig the room to your advantage.

938
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,360
Leave unseen.

939
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,119
Be mindful, however.

940
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:16,840
The repercussions of being exposed here would be severe.

941
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,880
I'm gonna be very careful.

942
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,800
I'm confident even more opportunities will reveal themselves once you arrive on site.

943
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,840
I'm going for the sniper nest.

944
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,480
To be entirely honest, this one's a bit of an embarrassment.

945
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:30,679
Please, make sure he doesn't come back again.

946
01:00:30,679 --> 01:00:31,960
I should act it.

947
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,079
Good luck.

948
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:36,039
I'm so ready for this.

949
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:37,400
One chance.

950
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,760
You cannot replay a target.

951
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,800
You only get one chance.

952
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,400
If you die, it's a game over.

953
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,480
You only have one time, one window, one death.

954
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:43,880
That's it.

955
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,440
Okay.

956
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,400
I can't fuck this up.

957
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:50,510
All right.

958
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:50,909
Planning.

959
01:00:51,929 --> 01:00:52,170
I...

960
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:53,369
Okay.

961
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:56,010
Oh, that makes me so nervous.

962
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:56,889
Okay, briefcase.

963
01:00:57,849 --> 01:00:59,900
How do I...

964
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,099
I want to put in the briefcase...

965
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,699
The shot...

966
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:03,260
Shotgun.

967
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:04,940
No, no, don't be an idiot.

968
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:06,300
This thing.

969
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:07,599
A mace.

970
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:09,199
I'm gonna kill him with a mace.

971
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:10,719
No.

972
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:17,530
What do I have for...

973
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,130
I don't have any other costumes.

974
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:19,679
All right.

975
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:20,559
I got it in the briefcase.

976
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:20,960
I got...

977
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,000
I'm gonna take coin.

978
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,800
I'm gonna lockpick.

979
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:24,250
Okay.

980
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,130
That's in the briefcase.

981
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:27,929
Smuggle of fish.

982
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:30,239
Not a bad idea.

983
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:35,739
I can't.

984
01:01:35,739 --> 01:01:36,860
Unless he's...

985
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,079
I'm gonna duck.

986
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:40,190
All right.

987
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:40,670
One chance.

988
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:40,989
That's it.

989
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:41,469
Oh, my God.

990
01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:44,139
I'm ready.

991
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:48,760
This contract is an elusive target.

992
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,280
In playing an elusive target, the following rules apply.

993
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,280
You must begin the contract before the countdown expires.

994
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,800
If you die, you may not retry.

995
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,960
Once you've completed the contract and successfully exited,

996
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,480
you may not retry the contract.

997
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:00,599
You may no longer restart the contract.

998
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:01,719
You cannot save your game.

999
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:11,449
Shit.

1000
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:19,079
He already failed?

1001
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:20,280
I don't say that yet.

1002
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,159
It hasn't happened yet.

1003
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,269
Good afternoon, 47.

1004
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,030
Your target is already inside the Miami Bayside Center.

1005
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:33,150
Faber has a full day of meetings planned

1006
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,789
and we do not want to risk losing him.

1007
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:38,590
Take your time with this one.

1008
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,590
Eliminate Mark Faber.

1009
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:48,110
He's already inside.

1010
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,170
And there's Jerma.

1011
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,989
Dave Ready, our informant,

1012
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:59,230
is waiting for you in the reception area.

1013
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:01,389
If you like, he can lead you to a meeting

1014
01:03:01,389 --> 01:03:03,309
where Faber will be in attendance.

1015
01:03:03,309 --> 01:03:05,469
What you do from then on is up to you.

1016
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,199
Be mindful.

1017
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:08,239
Talk to Dave.

1018
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:10,079
He will not wait around for long.

1019
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,719
Oh, fuck.

1020
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:11,760
All right.

1021
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,559
Well, hold on.

1022
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:12,800
Where?

1023
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:18,489
Can I go in here?

1024
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:20,829
Dave's ready.

1025
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:21,309
Are you?

1026
01:03:21,309 --> 01:03:23,309
Not yet, but I'm going to have to try.

1027
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,079
Hey, what's going on, Dave?

1028
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,760
Dave is ready.

1029
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,199
Ah, yes.

1030
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:34,480
You're the one I've been expecting.

1031
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,559
The special guest.

1032
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:37,440
I am.

1033
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,159
Okay.

1034
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,000
So like I told your superiors,

1035
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,800
I can get you inside the meeting, but that's it.

1036
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,239
What you do from there is up to you.

1037
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:46,960
Just how I like it.

1038
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,639
All right.

1039
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:50,519
You can't go in dressed like that.

1040
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:51,559
I thought I was going to be a sniper.

1041
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:56,679
I'll work something out.

1042
01:03:56,679 --> 01:03:56,920
Good.

1043
01:03:57,559 --> 01:03:58,920
I'll wait when you hear.

1044
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,880
The ICA has struck a deal with Dave ready.

1045
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,119
Okay.

1046
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:04,199
Hold on.

1047
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:05,000
Mission stories.

1048
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:09,000
They're expecting us upstairs in the conference room.

1049
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,400
Okay.

1050
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,679
I need to be an engineer.

1051
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:38,409
Okay.

1052
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:38,650
Got it.

1053
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,860
Briefcase and key card.

1054
01:04:44,349 --> 01:04:44,909
All right, Dave.

1055
01:04:44,909 --> 01:04:45,230
I'm ready.

1056
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:51,440
How's this?

1057
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,239
Where'd you find that?

1058
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:54,000
Never mind.

1059
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,079
I don't want to know.

1060
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:55,880
Let's go.

1061
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,639
Dave is already expecting us up there.

1062
01:04:57,639 --> 01:04:59,079
He's expecting us.

1063
01:04:59,079 --> 01:04:59,800
Oh, God.

1064
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,440
But hold on.

1065
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,079
Where are my exits?

1066
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:08,250
I have a sniper rifle in this briefcase.

1067
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:09,130
Are they going to search me?

1068
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:12,860
This guy's with me.

1069
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:15,869
What you do, I don't understand it.

1070
01:05:15,869 --> 01:05:17,949
This deal is closed when we enter the room.

1071
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:18,670
All right.

1072
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:19,550
I get you in.

1073
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:20,030
That's all.

1074
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:22,909
And then your people take care of my problem.

1075
01:05:22,909 --> 01:05:24,030
Don't worry.

1076
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,710
We'll fulfill our end of the bargain.

1077
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:27,389
Is there a place I can snipe from here?

1078
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:34,559
All the people like them are stupid.

1079
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,559
I thought I could make some quick cash, you know?

1080
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:37,679
Buy that yacht, sail a couple of...

1081
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:38,159
Hold on.

1082
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:39,360
This guy can see right through me.

1083
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,639
...for the summer.

1084
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:43,449
Oh, my God, computer.

1085
01:05:43,449 --> 01:05:44,409
Why are you doing this?

1086
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:45,929
...somethin' hemisphere.

1087
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:48,090
You don't try to cheat those kind of people.

1088
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:50,250
I wish I'd met you a little earlier, buddy.

1089
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,250
Could've used that advice six months ago, you know?

1090
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:54,409
Anyway, we're almost there.

1091
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,650
So let's put on our game faces.

1092
01:05:57,369 --> 01:05:57,929
Oh, fuck.

1093
01:05:57,929 --> 01:05:58,090
Okay.

1094
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:58,889
I got to get this right.

1095
01:05:59,929 --> 01:06:04,829
Hey, how you doing?

1096
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:05,070
He's...

1097
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:05,550
Is that him?

1098
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:06,829
So...

1099
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:07,550
Holy fuck, that's him.

1100
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:08,110
...you finally meet.

1101
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:08,829
That's him, that's him.

1102
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:10,190
You don't quite...

1103
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,349
I expected.

1104
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:13,389
Oh, God.

1105
01:06:13,389 --> 01:06:14,429
I'm Faber.

1106
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:15,949
Mr. Faber!

1107
01:06:15,949 --> 01:06:18,349
What an absolute pleasure to meet you.

1108
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:21,710
I'm Dave Reddy, special acquisition gatekeeper working with you on this job.

1109
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,610
I'd show you my breakbook when I'm sure you've already heard about me.

1110
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:28,110
Can't say that I haven't.

1111
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:31,210
Oh, I see.

1112
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:48,889
I've prepped an extensive briefing to help with...

1113
01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:58,860
Please help!

1114
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:59,340
Help me!

1115
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:57,639
I did it.

1116
01:07:57,639 --> 01:08:05,769
I did it.

1117
01:08:06,409 --> 01:08:07,130
I got to get out of here, though.

1118
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:07,449
Get out.

1119
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:12,570
Oh, my God.

1120
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:14,170
I'm going to burn this computer.

1121
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:56,619
Explosive penmanship.

1122
01:08:56,619 --> 01:08:59,819
They hit the aquarium and a clean headshot.

1123
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:05,920
One.

1124
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:13,439
Better than zero.

1125
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,449
Boat rental hut.

1126
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:18,159
HWK 21 MK2.

1127
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:19,600
Explosive pen.

1128
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,439
Florida fit with gloves.

1129
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:27,199
You're supposed to kill him creatively?

1130
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,680
I'm not good enough for that, man.

1131
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:33,239
See?

1132
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:33,720
I just need...

1133
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,840
That's all I want is the checkbox.

1134
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,880
I just want to get the diploma.

1135
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:42,569
All right, let's go to...

1136
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:45,680
Let's go to this neighborhood place.

1137
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:52,380
So let's start.

1138
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:54,859
I want to start in the construction area.

1139
01:09:55,579 --> 01:09:58,199
Okay.

1140
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,329
I do have this now, but that's not silenced.

1141
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,319
Not like it matters.

1142
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:10,250
I can't believe you shot that guy and looked cool doing it.

1143
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:13,039
All right, briefcase.

1144
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,359
I can't take that with the current disguise?

1145
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:16,880
No, I guess not.

1146
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:19,529
A fish is okay.

1147
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:21,979
That's not suspicious.

1148
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,119
Apparently, there's a grenade.

1149
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,039
All right, we'll take the pen.

1150
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,100
All right.

1151
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,739
So let's see what we got for mission stories here.

1152
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,760
Pest control.

1153
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,560
House for sale.

1154
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:42,750
Whack-a-mole, we did that one.

1155
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:43,949
No smoking area.

1156
01:10:44,989 --> 01:10:49,819
What about pest control?

1157
01:10:49,819 --> 01:10:50,779
Or house for sale?

1158
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:52,779
Yeah, let's do house for sale.

1159
01:10:53,340 --> 01:11:04,489
Oh my god.

1160
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:18,939
What?

1161
01:11:18,939 --> 01:11:19,500
All right, let's go.

1162
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:27,390
You show him rooms and how...

1163
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:27,949
We'll find out.

1164
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:30,750
Did I put it on casual?

1165
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:31,550
No, I didn't, did I?

1166
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,720
So I'm pretending...

1167
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,779
Don't I have to get like an application to work here?

1168
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,720
Why is 47 just a construction worker?

1169
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:58,350
All right, so we got radio.

1170
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:07,020
No, no, no, I want to do the house for sale.

1171
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:11,800
I think I can see through me.

1172
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,680
Why would I even be here?

1173
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,159
No, don't throw things at people.

1174
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:24,840
Just do it.

1175
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,960
Don't throw wrenches.

1176
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,840
I always said bricks.

1177
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:39,289
Jerma loves role play stuff.

1178
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:41,149
It's kind of fun.

1179
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:45,850
All right, here we go.

1180
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:48,220
This is the open house.

1181
01:13:12,569 --> 01:13:14,250
I mean, I can just take as many as I want.

1182
01:13:18,329 --> 01:13:19,050
I want them all.

1183
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:19,850
Give me all of them.

1184
01:13:23,369 --> 01:13:24,729
Proximity mine?

1185
01:13:24,729 --> 01:13:25,229
No.

1186
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,010
I can say that I do.

1187
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:30,010
Well, how do I make it explode?

1188
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:34,489
You know, the one that police are down after the incident.

1189
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:36,649
I'm not really from around here.

1190
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:37,369
I don't know.

1191
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:39,130
I just want to test it and see what it does.

1192
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,649
Well, never mind.

1193
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:41,449
You can wait a little.

1194
01:13:41,449 --> 01:13:44,010
Oh, I'm not sure I've seen you.

1195
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:54,890
Anybody else feel that?

1196
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,020
So it's a grenade, but it also can kill people on contact.

1197
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:07,520
Okay.

1198
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,220
Maybe you know him.

1199
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,340
Mr. Nolan Cassidy.

1200
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:11,819
All right.

1201
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:12,619
So this is the guy.

1202
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:13,420
This is the real estate guy.

1203
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,140
Well, he's interested in the Schmidt house down the road.

1204
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:19,739
You know, the one that police are down after the, well, incident.

1205
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:21,020
I'm not really from around here.

1206
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:21,579
47.

1207
01:14:21,579 --> 01:14:23,500
A real taste for the sweet things in life

1208
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,460
is in Whittleton Creek to show a house to Nolan Cassidy.

1209
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,739
It looks like he's stuck at a local muffin stand.

1210
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:30,380
Don't be ashamed.

1211
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:31,340
Keep Cassidy waiting.

1212
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,079
This guy's a server.

1213
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:35,800
Never mind.

1214
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,479
You can wait a little longer.

1215
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,880
I need to squeeze a couple more of these beauties down.

1216
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,119
All right.

1217
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:43,399
So there's a server somewhere else in one of these houses.

1218
01:14:44,119 --> 01:14:50,619
The question is, which house was he in?

1219
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:53,420
Kill him with a muffin.

1220
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,439
No, no, that's, that's too easy.

1221
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:00,479
I want this guy going to break

1222
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,210
because I know there's another muffin person somewhere.

1223
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,119
Sir, get out of my way.

1224
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:14,489
I'm leaving.

1225
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:15,449
Just hold on.

1226
01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:17,359
What's my muffin of choice?

1227
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:21,199
Chocolate, chocolate chip muffins or cornbread muffin.

1228
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,920
I don't really, not a big muffin guy.

1229
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:39,640
There's the party muffin in mailbox muffin delivery service.

1230
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,640
Uh, I don't see the server here.

1231
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:50,590
He's a server, but is he though?

1232
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:52,270
He's kind of just a guy at the grill.

1233
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,560
Maybe that guy goes on a break.

1234
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,520
Do you go on a break?

1235
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:23,479
What's the fucking door?

1236
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,220
Oh, that was a stale.

1237
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:35,020
Those are stale muffins.

1238
01:16:38,729 --> 01:16:40,779
Is there anybody else in the house?

1239
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:49,560
Where can I put this guy?

1240
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:54,720
Is there nowhere I can put you?

1241
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,109
Did I bring a fish?

1242
01:16:58,109 --> 01:16:59,149
I did not bring a fish.

1243
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:02,989
No, he'll be fine.

1244
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,399
Just flush him down the toilet.

1245
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:07,520
All right.

1246
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,720
Obtain rat poison.

1247
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:16,479
I wish there was a spit button.

1248
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:28,829
All right, rat poison.

1249
01:17:28,829 --> 01:17:30,510
And then we're going to go become the realtor.

1250
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:34,970
Put him in the dryer.

1251
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:42,640
Knock, knock.

1252
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,640
I'm looking for my secret ingredient.

1253
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,859
Oh, what?

1254
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:49,500
What?

1255
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,000
Is this the guy that lost a pinwheel?

1256
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:57,279
Yes.

1257
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,640
Yes, it was.

1258
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,159
It was incredibly embarrassing.

1259
01:18:05,369 --> 01:18:06,649
I couldn't believe it when it happened.

1260
01:18:07,529 --> 01:18:08,890
I cried on stream.

1261
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,890
Tears were just streaming down my fucking face.

1262
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,159
I kept on going like I can't do it.

1263
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:14,720
I can't.

1264
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,399
I can't fucking do it.

1265
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,439
Everyone's just laughing.

1266
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:21,119
Laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing.

1267
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,199
Where's the poison?

1268
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:36,840
I don't see any poison in here.

1269
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,949
There we go.

1270
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:40,430
All right.

1271
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:42,350
Place the muffin on a serving plate.

1272
01:18:51,079 --> 01:18:52,039
I picked up a joint.

1273
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,079
Apparently.

1274
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:57,760
Well, that guy's not me.

1275
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,880
How do I get rid of him?

1276
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:05,840
If that guy can see right through me,

1277
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,279
then how am I supposed to get around him?

1278
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:17,289
Am I going to just pretend to be this guy behind him?

1279
01:19:24,489 --> 01:19:25,609
He's kind of distracted.

1280
01:19:25,609 --> 01:19:28,329
Disguise yourself as a real estate broker.

1281
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:34,060
Just watch me do it.

1282
01:19:34,779 --> 01:19:37,319
You even have to watch it.

1283
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:38,520
He's got a question mark.

1284
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:39,560
Huh?

1285
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:40,680
What?

1286
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:42,920
I should try it.

1287
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,659
And not just our height.

1288
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:54,539
Eat the whole thing.

1289
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:00,800
I feel sick.

1290
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:03,970
Okay.

1291
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,390
Say hello to your breakfast.

1292
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:08,029
Okay.

1293
01:20:08,029 --> 01:20:08,829
What was that?

1294
01:20:08,829 --> 01:20:12,270
That was weirdly Microsoft Sam in my ear.

1295
01:20:13,149 --> 01:20:20,520
So where does he go?

1296
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:22,970
Wait, I can go in the sewer?

1297
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:41,119
Oh, what?

1298
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:42,319
I thought I was going to shoot at him.

1299
01:20:43,529 --> 01:20:44,890
That was so anticlimactic.

1300
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:46,409
I thought I was going to spray straight in the line

1301
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:47,289
and hit him right in the back.

1302
01:20:51,789 --> 01:20:52,989
Throw him down the sewer.

1303
01:20:52,989 --> 01:20:53,869
Throw him down the sewer.

1304
01:20:53,869 --> 01:20:54,750
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1305
01:20:58,590 --> 01:20:59,229
Where are you going?

1306
01:21:17,949 --> 01:21:19,390
I'm trying to think of like smoke weed.

1307
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,199
Had to be this trash can.

1308
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:26,800
Yeah, why this trash can?

1309
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,920
Although here's the problem.

1310
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:31,899
Okay, I got the key.

1311
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:36,079
Um, I can stuff him in there.

1312
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,319
That was so loud.

1313
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:45,439
That's so loud.

1314
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:46,560
That was louder than anything.

1315
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:53,869
Put him in the trash can.

1316
01:21:53,869 --> 01:21:54,670
I don't think I can put him.

1317
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:05,899
Okay.

1318
01:22:05,899 --> 01:22:07,550
Locate and approach Cassidy.

1319
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:25,680
So where's Cassidy?

1320
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:44,970
I think it's just on the phone.

1321
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:50,970
It's the green icon.

1322
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:51,850
I know where it is.

1323
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:53,529
I'm just looking to see if there's anything else over here.

1324
01:22:54,090 --> 01:23:03,310
I'm seeing if there's anything else to do.

1325
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:07,560
Throw the shovel at him.

1326
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,600
I'm not going to throw a shovel at him.

1327
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,960
I'm going to wait until we get in the house.

1328
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,329
Aren't you the realtor?

1329
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:12,569
Yes.

1330
01:23:12,569 --> 01:23:15,130
Mr. Cassidy, I'm sorry for the delay.

1331
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,930
I'm ready to take you to the house.

1332
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,050
About time.

1333
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:20,649
Let's go.

1334
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:21,689
Poke him with the fish.

1335
01:23:21,689 --> 01:23:22,649
All right, unlock the door.

1336
01:23:23,609 --> 01:23:24,649
Last one on the right.

1337
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,060
All right, let's go.

1338
01:23:28,699 --> 01:23:30,060
Do I have to just run ahead?

1339
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:30,699
Come on, let's go.

1340
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:40,199
I was planting trees behind the property.

1341
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:43,600
Pick up, what is it?

1342
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,760
Pick up note for real estate company.

1343
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:47,800
Unlock the door.

1344
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:55,949
See?

1345
01:23:55,949 --> 01:23:56,510
It works.

1346
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:59,149
Who's investigating a distraction?

1347
01:23:59,789 --> 01:24:02,520
Somebody in this house?

1348
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,319
What are you doing in here?

1349
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:11,439
All right, let's convince him to buy the house.

1350
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:18,829
Thank you.

1351
01:24:18,829 --> 01:24:19,310
Goodbye.

1352
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:21,680
All right, the tour.

1353
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,840
So we have a television over here.

1354
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,560
There's a piano.

1355
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:25,680
TV.

1356
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:26,880
Take a look.

1357
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:29,039
Nice TV.

1358
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,399
This is the downstairs living room.

1359
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,000
It is most commonly used for watching television

1360
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,159
and other recreational purposes.

1361
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:40,199
Yeah, would you like a fish start?

1362
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:40,920
A large room.

1363
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,960
It's too easy to get to exits.

1364
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,880
Dark floors hide stains easily.

1365
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:51,079
A room with lots of potential.

1366
01:24:51,079 --> 01:24:53,079
What about storage possibilities?

1367
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,920
Anything of that nature.

1368
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,840
Well, that's why the shovel exists.

1369
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:57,720
This guy likes sushi.

1370
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:02,539
All right, come up here.

1371
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:04,119
Follow me.

1372
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:14,750
Here's the bathroom.

1373
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,270
There's a lot of storage in the bathroom.

1374
01:25:17,229 --> 01:25:41,600
Oh, hey, how are you?

1375
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,359
Okay, let's take a look at the upstairs.

1376
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:55,199
Look, there's a TV up here.

1377
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:55,840
What?

1378
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,520
I turned on the TV.

1379
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,609
Come up here and take a look at the attic.

1380
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,720
What?

1381
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:20,329
What are you doing?

1382
01:26:20,329 --> 01:26:21,770
Hold on, I'm trying to show him the house.

1383
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,439
A spare bedroom, in case you have a lot of house guests.

1384
01:26:31,239 --> 01:26:33,960
It could also be used as an upstairs office

1385
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,840
or a storage space with easy access to the attic above.

1386
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:40,279
Yeah, you want to see it?

1387
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:40,680
I don't know.

1388
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,039
Got anything more interesting to show me?

1389
01:26:42,039 --> 01:26:42,920
It's all very interesting.

1390
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,960
Yeah, come on, come on.

1391
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:44,680
This way, this way.

1392
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,119
Well, I don't.

1393
01:26:49,609 --> 01:26:50,810
Well, I can't even open this door.

1394
01:26:51,449 --> 01:26:59,310
This room is small.

1395
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:00,109
I need to wow him.

1396
01:27:00,109 --> 01:27:01,310
I really need to wow him with something.

1397
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:22,220
Hey.

1398
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:22,699
What's this?

1399
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,590
You can't go around throwing stuff like that.

1400
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:27,470
What's the matter with you?

1401
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:29,420
Oh, no.

1402
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:31,340
Norman Cassidy is down.

1403
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:31,899
Good work.

1404
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:34,060
Janus awaits your attention.

1405
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,640
All right, let's do...

1406
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:46,520
No, wait.

1407
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,800
Yeah, I'm good right here.

1408
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,840
1808.

1409
01:27:48,840 --> 01:28:05,529
In case you have a lot of house guests.

1410
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:06,090
Let me see.

1411
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,159
Uh, Intel.

1412
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:10,520
I cleaned the place as requested.

1413
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,159
I was told the real estate agent would pick up the keys,

1414
01:28:13,159 --> 01:28:16,279
so I put it in the flower pot next to the door.

1415
01:28:18,729 --> 01:28:20,970
It could also be used as an upstairs office.

1416
01:28:20,970 --> 01:28:22,409
Flower pot next to the door.

1417
01:28:22,409 --> 01:28:25,930
Or a storage space with easy access to the attic.

1418
01:28:26,489 --> 01:28:27,689
This is like the president guy.

1419
01:28:44,779 --> 01:28:45,979
Oh, I was like, where the fuck did he go?

1420
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:50,619
Okay, so we can go down here.

1421
01:28:52,109 --> 01:28:52,750
Follow me.

1422
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:53,789
We'll show you something interesting.

1423
01:28:54,510 --> 01:29:01,319
Ding dong ditch your own house.

1424
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,600
Here you go.

1425
01:29:03,399 --> 01:29:08,439
So I see the basement has a ample room.

1426
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:09,800
And here's the basement.

1427
01:29:10,439 --> 01:29:13,560
The usual boiler elements are to be found down here.

1428
01:29:14,569 --> 01:29:18,409
And it seems a room with a safe of some sort.

1429
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:21,529
Now that's more like it.

1430
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:22,649
It's like a vault.

1431
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:29,399
Let's unlock the vault door.

1432
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:30,520
It's like a vault door to open.

1433
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,159
Okay.

1434
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:32,199
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1435
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,359
Nice work, 47.

1436
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:36,840
Let's hope he doesn't set off the alarm somehow.

1437
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,399
Wait, what?

1438
01:29:37,399 --> 01:29:39,579
Very nice.

1439
01:29:39,579 --> 01:29:40,220
I don't understand.

1440
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:40,460
Wait, he's-

1441
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,300
All right, let me have a look at this thing.

1442
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:43,420
Is he able to get murdered?

1443
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,979
The very strong-standing Matrix laser home security system.

1444
01:29:45,979 --> 01:29:48,539
We used to break these open for training at the academy.

1445
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:54,159
The thing about these systems is most homeowners are lazy.

1446
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:55,119
Seriously?

1447
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:58,319
They don't reset the back resets and enter their own codes.

1448
01:29:58,319 --> 01:29:59,119
Push him in?

1449
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:01,840
Let's just try the standard admin code.

1450
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,069
Just for fun.

1451
01:30:03,069 --> 01:30:04,430
What if I go in?

1452
01:30:04,989 --> 01:30:12,800
Looks like Schmidt was a bigger amateur than I imagined.

1453
01:30:15,819 --> 01:30:16,460
Is he gonna go in?

1454
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:24,329
Go outside and check the garden.

1455
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:28,199
How visible this vault is from the outside.

1456
01:30:28,199 --> 01:30:31,720
Anything sticking out of the ground, weird, sloping things like that.

1457
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:32,680
You got it, sir.

1458
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,000
So you're looking to sell this for, uh, how-

1459
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,500
What?

1460
01:30:36,279 --> 01:30:37,640
Just disable this.

1461
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:41,000
I never did like these cron-stead systems.

1462
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,119
Or that pompous-

1463
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:43,640
So you're looking to sell this for-

1464
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,199
What?

1465
01:30:44,199 --> 01:30:45,159
How much was it again?

1466
01:30:45,159 --> 01:30:45,880
1.1.

1467
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,079
Sounds about right.

1468
01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:48,039
I suppose that's not-

1469
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,760
No, don't turn it back on!

1470
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,399
You know what?

1471
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:52,600
Never mind.

1472
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:52,920
What?

1473
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,039
I don't think I want to buy this-

1474
01:30:55,159 --> 01:30:55,800
Turn it on.

1475
01:30:56,760 --> 01:31:03,100
Janus awaits your attention.

1476
01:31:12,859 --> 01:31:18,479
Wait, don't turn it back on.

1477
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:23,979
You know what?

1478
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,340
Ah, never mind.

1479
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:25,979
I don't care.

1480
01:31:25,979 --> 01:31:26,859
I'm not gonna run.

1481
01:31:26,859 --> 01:31:28,220
I'm just gonna accept my fate.

1482
01:31:40,029 --> 01:31:41,229
No, computer!

1483
01:31:41,229 --> 01:31:41,789
Stop it!

1484
01:31:46,109 --> 01:31:46,909
Never mind.

1485
01:31:46,909 --> 01:31:48,510
I don't want to buy this place.

1486
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:01,359
All right.

1487
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:01,840
Let's go-

1488
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,399
What else is there to do?

1489
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,560
An apple a day.

1490
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,800
The story mission did it.

1491
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,760
No smoking.

1492
01:32:11,069 --> 01:32:11,710
We did-

1493
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:13,229
We kind of started that one.

1494
01:32:13,789 --> 01:32:15,449
Let me try this one.

1495
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:20,399
Do the dad living in the walls bit.

1496
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:30,510
What happened with the elusive target?

1497
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:32,909
Did it first try in less than two minutes.

1498
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:36,699
Not a lie.

1499
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,520
I didn't make that up.

1500
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,189
Why does she hear that all the-

1501
01:32:48,189 --> 01:32:49,710
She would know you hear that all the way out here.

1502
01:32:54,699 --> 01:32:55,020
All right.

1503
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:55,979
Cigarettes.

1504
01:32:55,979 --> 01:32:56,939
I'll take them.

1505
01:32:56,939 --> 01:32:57,659
They're back here.

1506
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:00,539
I don't-

1507
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:01,579
I can't get back there.

1508
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:03,680
I have to climb over this.

1509
01:33:05,369 --> 01:33:06,250
Climb through here.

1510
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:07,449
This is where the tree house is.

1511
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:08,090
I'm gonna save it.

1512
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,500
You can hear it through the whole house?

1513
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,649
That's the point of a doorbell?

1514
01:33:14,649 --> 01:33:16,250
My doorbell is really silent.

1515
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:29,439
Blend in as a gardener.

1516
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:34,829
What is in here?

1517
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:39,079
Hold on.

1518
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:39,399
I'm just-

1519
01:33:39,399 --> 01:33:40,439
I'm just exploring a little.

1520
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:41,159
I'm just curious.

1521
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,479
All right.

1522
01:33:43,479 --> 01:33:44,520
We got a basement.

1523
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:44,760
Wait.

1524
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:52,779
Oh.

1525
01:33:56,079 --> 01:33:56,560
Right.

1526
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:56,880
Okay.

1527
01:33:58,319 --> 01:34:16,479
Okay.

1528
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:17,600
Nothing over here that I need.

1529
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:20,960
I need to try to sneak through here.

1530
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:26,010
I can't unlock this shit from this way.

1531
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:27,289
I can't even go over there.

1532
01:34:27,289 --> 01:34:28,489
I gotta go all the way around?

1533
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:32,829
Goodness.

1534
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:47,520
I'm sorry.

1535
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:47,840
They had-

1536
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,960
The guy was doing the T-pose.

1537
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:49,600
I had to get around.

1538
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,000
I had to do-

1539
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,199
That guy was broken.

1540
01:34:51,199 --> 01:35:29,880
All right.

1541
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,079
I'm gonna have a golf club, so...

1542
01:35:38,039 --> 01:35:38,279
What?

1543
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,199
I want to use the golf club.

1544
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:44,479
I can't do that apparently?

1545
01:35:46,909 --> 01:35:47,229
Wait.

1546
01:35:47,869 --> 01:35:51,390
That's not an ordinary resident of Wittleton Creek 47.

1547
01:35:51,390 --> 01:35:51,550
What?

1548
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:54,590
This must be one of Cassidy's men working undercover.

1549
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:56,510
I suggest you keep an eye out for more of them.

1550
01:35:57,229 --> 01:35:59,050
Okay.

1551
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:00,649
Shovel.

1552
01:36:03,149 --> 01:36:03,630
Anything else?

1553
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:06,319
All right.

1554
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:07,199
Smoking kills.

1555
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:16,159
Use the rake.

1556
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,140
I can't grab the rake.

1557
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:20,859
Where's there a rake?

1558
01:36:21,659 --> 01:36:23,720
Golf club.

1559
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:24,119
Shovel.

1560
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:27,579
Where's there a rake?

1561
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:40,329
You can just let people walk into the rake.

1562
01:36:40,329 --> 01:36:40,810
Oh, yeah.

1563
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:41,449
I've seen that.

1564
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:44,109
I have seen it.

1565
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:48,909
Well, I'm just gonna move out of here.

1566
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:51,880
The rake.

1567
01:36:57,159 --> 01:36:57,960
All right.

1568
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,800
I need smoking kills.

1569
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:00,840
So I have the cigarettes.

1570
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:05,659
I could give them weed too, couldn't I?

1571
01:37:05,659 --> 01:37:06,699
Give them some marijuana.

1572
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:12,539
Game's gonna trap you until you find the rake.

1573
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,840
So do I?

1574
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,600
I need to like poison these, don't I?

1575
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:29,199
Did I lose this opportunity?

1576
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,539
I think I may have lost this opportunity.

1577
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:38,510
No, there we go.

1578
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:40,590
One of Janice's guards has apparently

1579
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:41,630
tossed his cigarettes over the fence

1580
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:42,270
and into the backyard.

1581
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:43,630
Janice is using an oxygen apparatus

1582
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:44,430
to help him breathe better

1583
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:45,949
and the guard is trying to keep Janice alive.

1584
01:37:45,949 --> 01:37:46,590
Okay.

1585
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:48,750
So I just go up there and let him smoke the cigarette?

1586
01:37:52,279 --> 01:37:54,359
So just go in the house and have him smoke.

1587
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,239
Okay.

1588
01:37:59,149 --> 01:38:00,829
So where is that old man?

1589
01:38:00,829 --> 01:38:01,229
There he is.

1590
01:38:08,779 --> 01:38:09,819
These guys are gonna let me in, right?

1591
01:38:16,569 --> 01:38:16,890
Really?

1592
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:19,180
Okay.

1593
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:23,239
Well, fine.

1594
01:38:23,239 --> 01:38:24,279
I'm going through a fucking window.

1595
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,560
Don't load the game.

1596
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:36,000
Save the game.

1597
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:53,899
All right.

1598
01:38:53,899 --> 01:38:54,539
Let's see.

1599
01:38:54,539 --> 01:38:55,500
Who's the closest person?

1600
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:58,489
Should I like lie down?

1601
01:38:59,789 --> 01:39:00,909
Perform health check.

1602
01:39:01,949 --> 01:39:08,880
All right.

1603
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:09,520
Where's that guy going?

1604
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,720
I need to take that guy's disguise.

1605
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,479
There he goes.

1606
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:14,199
You coming in here?

1607
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:20,460
Shit.

1608
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:23,949
I gotta go around him.

1609
01:39:23,949 --> 01:39:24,909
Or you need to come in here.

1610
01:39:25,789 --> 01:39:32,329
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.

1611
01:39:33,930 --> 01:39:34,649
Quickly, quickly.

1612
01:39:34,649 --> 01:39:35,369
Come on, come on, come on.

1613
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:46,520
Excellent.

1614
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:48,319
Pick up the Uzi.

1615
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,359
Hide it.

1616
01:39:50,329 --> 01:39:50,569
Okay.

1617
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:52,670
Time to give him his cigarettes.

1618
01:39:55,079 --> 01:39:56,680
You guys can all see through my disguise.

1619
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:00,430
It's kind of annoying.

1620
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,140
Say, Gunter.

1621
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:16,569
Did you see my photograph?

1622
01:40:16,569 --> 01:40:18,970
The group photo from the first gathering?

1623
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:22,250
Janice is looking for an old group photo.

1624
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:25,210
It might be interesting to see who's always in his brief.

1625
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:26,409
No, I need cigarettes.

1626
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:30,909
Turn on the cigarettes.

1627
01:40:32,029 --> 01:40:35,149
How do I like put plant cigarettes over here so he smokes them?

1628
01:40:35,149 --> 01:40:35,630
Here we go.

1629
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,279
Rig the oxygen tank.

1630
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,060
All right.

1631
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:45,100
And then hide in the closet.

1632
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,220
Good work, 47.

1633
01:40:46,779 --> 01:40:53,390
All there is left to do now is wait.

1634
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:53,789
I did it.

1635
01:40:57,479 --> 01:40:59,720
I just read the game FAQ?

1636
01:40:59,720 --> 01:40:59,960
No.

1637
01:41:05,289 --> 01:41:05,689
Yes.

1638
01:41:06,569 --> 01:41:11,560
I'm gonna be in here.

1639
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,359
Look at how far away he is.

1640
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:13,560
I'm gonna be here for a long time.

1641
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:22,840
Uh, save?

1642
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:23,880
I got an auto-save.

1643
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:24,119
I'm good.

1644
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:34,649
Can I hide under the bed or somewhere that I can see better?

1645
01:41:35,449 --> 01:41:46,199
All right, here he comes.

1646
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:47,800
Let's get a save here.

1647
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:55,319
I'm coming upstairs.

1648
01:41:58,140 --> 01:41:59,100
No, is he actually...

1649
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:01,899
He's not gonna go out and look at the mole hills, right?

1650
01:42:02,619 --> 01:42:05,819
Do the grandpa voice.

1651
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:06,300
Oh, okay.

1652
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:07,739
This is fucking stupid.

1653
01:42:08,909 --> 01:42:12,489
I hate this place and I hate all of you idiots.

1654
01:42:12,489 --> 01:42:13,609
Taking away my cigarettes.

1655
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:23,760
That's your last fucking straw.

1656
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,399
He's doing it.

1657
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:25,359
He's doing the voice.

1658
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:25,920
He's doing it.

1659
01:42:29,819 --> 01:42:30,539
So funny story.

1660
01:42:30,539 --> 01:42:35,020
I was at the grocery store and they got so many pastas there.

1661
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:36,939
How are you supposed to pick up your favorite pasta?

1662
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:41,319
I just fell backwards in my chair and like hurt myself.

1663
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,560
That would have been pretty fucking crazy.

1664
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:55,199
I would have caused damage.

1665
01:42:55,840 --> 01:43:02,199
Where's this old fucking man?

1666
01:43:02,199 --> 01:43:03,880
Might as well just get out and just hang out in here.

1667
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:16,170
Sit in his chair.

1668
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:19,289
I was gonna breathe in his oxygen.

1669
01:43:21,399 --> 01:43:21,960
You coming?

1670
01:43:34,649 --> 01:43:35,930
You old fucking man.

1671
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:37,850
Hurry up and get up here.

1672
01:43:40,729 --> 01:43:41,689
Turn on the radio.

1673
01:43:42,649 --> 01:43:49,050
Pee in his bed.

1674
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,079
I'm being patient.

1675
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:10,079
I am being very patient.

1676
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,880
I'm playing this correct.

1677
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:13,760
We're just hanging out.

1678
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,119
We're playing it right.

1679
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,000
Bro, you are so fucked.

1680
01:44:20,939 --> 01:44:21,420
Am I though?

1681
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:23,640
I don't think so.

1682
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,119
You haven't lived until you peed in another man's bed.

1683
01:44:37,739 --> 01:44:38,779
How would they know it was me?

1684
01:44:41,789 --> 01:44:42,510
If I peed in...

1685
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:43,149
Okay, here we go.

1686
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:49,180
He'd probably think it was a cat or a dog or something.

1687
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:50,399
This is it.

1688
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:51,199
This is the climax.

1689
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,829
I'm ready for it.

1690
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,439
Fresh cigarettes.

1691
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:02,829
Rigged up oxygen tank.

1692
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:08,350
How's he doing?

1693
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:11,659
Just sit in that chair.

1694
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,180
Uh-huh.

1695
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:16,300
Almost.

1696
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:17,920
Almost.

1697
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:20,220
He's almost there.

1698
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:21,899
That's a little closer.

1699
01:45:23,069 --> 01:45:23,869
Okay, he's there.

1700
01:45:25,079 --> 01:45:27,399
Ah, I think I have a pack of fresh cigarettes.

1701
01:45:47,069 --> 01:45:47,569
Whoa!

1702
01:45:50,189 --> 01:45:50,689
What?

1703
01:45:51,869 --> 01:45:52,670
That was quick.

1704
01:45:53,869 --> 01:45:54,989
That was really quick.

1705
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:57,869
Hold on, wait.

1706
01:45:57,869 --> 01:45:58,369
Is that...

1707
01:46:01,449 --> 01:46:02,890
Is that camera up there going to be there?

1708
01:46:03,529 --> 01:46:07,149
I want to see something.

1709
01:46:07,710 --> 01:46:15,159
If that camera is up there, I want to try something.

1710
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:29,020
Let's wait till it gets right here.

1711
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:32,220
Joke incoming.

1712
01:46:33,310 --> 01:46:33,810
Um...

1713
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:35,390
No, not really.

1714
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:37,789
More like I want to see if the angle shows me do this.

1715
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:39,529
Which would be funny.

1716
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:47,020
Joke alert.

1717
01:46:47,579 --> 01:46:48,460
Joke alert.

1718
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:49,260
Joke alert.

1719
01:46:49,979 --> 01:46:57,159
So we're going to see the picture in picture up there.

1720
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:05,369
Come on, let's see it.

1721
01:47:05,369 --> 01:47:06,010
Picture in picture.

1722
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:06,510
I want to see it.

1723
01:47:08,409 --> 01:47:10,560
Here we go.

1724
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:29,340
I think you can see it.

1725
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:35,260
The top left.

1726
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:42,890
Peek through the window.

1727
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:43,609
I... you can't.

1728
01:47:44,409 --> 01:47:45,979
That wasn't a...

1729
01:47:45,979 --> 01:47:46,779
I wasn't a joke.

1730
01:47:46,779 --> 01:47:48,060
I was just seeing what would happen.

1731
01:47:48,699 --> 01:47:51,770
I want to see if the picture in picture turned off.

1732
01:47:55,159 --> 01:48:00,479
I thought you could throw the baseball at him.

1733
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:01,279
Oh, fuck.

1734
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:01,840
You're right.

1735
01:48:02,479 --> 01:48:06,939
I'm going to get up and point blank throw it at his face.

1736
01:48:25,899 --> 01:48:27,979
Just point blank throw it as hard as you can.

1737
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:33,930
Did that kill him?

1738
01:48:41,739 --> 01:48:42,460
No, I'm done.

1739
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:55,520
First constant catch up with you.

1740
01:48:57,069 --> 01:48:59,949
That feels like an easy way out for a man like Janus.

1741
01:48:59,949 --> 01:49:00,590
I did that.

1742
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:01,970
Still.

1743
01:49:03,479 --> 01:49:05,319
We are close now, gentlemen.

1744
01:49:05,319 --> 01:49:06,439
Both targets are dead.

1745
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:21,819
All right, well, that was fun.

1746
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,000
Anybody smiling in here?

1747
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,199
What do you mean smiling?

1748
01:50:07,069 --> 01:50:14,960
Fuck the brownies.

1749
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:26,460
Pop 100.

1750
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:27,899
Oh, we're all the way back here.

1751
01:50:27,899 --> 01:50:29,260
Don't replay the whole mission.

1752
01:50:32,909 --> 01:50:33,949
He's checked out.

1753
01:50:35,930 --> 01:50:38,090
This guy is totally checked the fuck out right now.

1754
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:58,430
Trying to throw them.

1755
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:05,689
Throw it off screen.

1756
01:51:06,729 --> 01:51:07,210
Hold on.

1757
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:08,329
Wait, wait, wait.

1758
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:17,739
It's when he said as old, like right here.

1759
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:29,899
Throw it at the camera.

1760
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:33,199
I'm going to throw it at the camera.

1761
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:41,239
That actually might be kind of funny because then it would bounce off the wall.

1762
01:51:41,239 --> 01:51:42,279
All right, let's go try that.

1763
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,359
And then I'm going to load a different mission.

1764
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:49,710
Don't give him any more ideas.

1765
01:52:01,369 --> 01:52:01,850
Shit.

1766
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:03,369
Oh, I did it wrong.

1767
01:52:03,369 --> 01:52:04,010
I have to kill him.

1768
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:14,279
Throw the joint.

1769
01:52:14,279 --> 01:52:16,840
Now, I got to kill both these guys while the camera is on.

1770
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,079
I'm going to throw it into the camera.

1771
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:20,600
Like right now.

1772
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:21,000
Here we go.

1773
01:52:23,239 --> 01:52:23,720
Guard.

1774
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,520
What's up?

1775
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:25,880
What's this guy's problem?

1776
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:26,760
Christ sakes.

1777
01:52:27,899 --> 01:52:28,380
That's enough.

1778
01:52:31,979 --> 01:52:34,319
Okay, here we go.

1779
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,039
No.

1780
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:56,680
It turned off.

1781
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:57,560
Hold on.

1782
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:01,000
This is the last time and I'm going to open up another mission

1783
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,920
because we're just fucking around at this point.

1784
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:06,670
The cameraman fucked it up.

1785
01:53:06,670 --> 01:53:11,180
I'm going to make this quick.

1786
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:25,819
I didn't do it.

1787
01:53:36,649 --> 01:53:37,609
Last fucking time.

1788
01:53:37,609 --> 01:53:38,810
I promise this is the last time.

1789
01:54:04,569 --> 01:54:06,010
No, it wasn't even fucking worth it.

1790
01:54:06,649 --> 01:54:08,569
I almost just alt tab and deleted the game.

1791
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,479
All right, go back.

1792
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:12,800
Get back.

1793
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:13,359
We're going out.

1794
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:31,239
All right.

1795
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:33,960
I think I broke everything.

1796
01:54:37,659 --> 01:54:38,699
Let's go here.

1797
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:43,770
Alt tab.

1798
01:54:45,479 --> 01:54:47,560
Didn't even take the first step in doing that.

1799
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:50,640
Let's go here.

1800
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:53,340
Quiet mode.

1801
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:05,739
It's taking syringe.

1802
01:55:07,229 --> 01:55:09,390
I thought quiet mode was only supposed to be three hours.

1803
01:55:10,029 --> 01:55:10,350
Yeah.

1804
01:55:11,979 --> 01:55:13,100
Yeah, it was.

1805
01:55:18,079 --> 01:55:19,039
Get in that dryer.

1806
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:21,199
All right, what is it?

1807
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:24,159
I want to start at the chapel.

1808
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:32,159
It didn't last two hours.

1809
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,359
You know, part of me thinks I'm going to go back.

1810
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:40,000
I think I'm going to go back and play Quiet Man again after this.

1811
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:45,579
I think I'm going to go back and beat it at the end.

1812
01:55:54,279 --> 01:55:54,520
What?

1813
01:55:54,520 --> 01:56:07,399
Oh, they didn't do anything.

1814
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:13,659
They're all trying to get out.

1815
01:56:14,539 --> 01:56:16,539
They're all becoming one person.

1816
01:56:16,539 --> 01:56:22,489
That is the most single file.

1817
01:56:22,489 --> 01:56:28,989
Do these people just spawn in?

1818
01:56:35,739 --> 01:56:37,020
Did I put anything in the briefcase?

1819
01:56:37,659 --> 01:56:51,579
You need to try to put a mine there.

1820
01:56:51,579 --> 01:56:57,640
Oh, whoops.

1821
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:04,479
Go put a trap at that exit.

1822
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:05,600
Oh, god damn it.

1823
01:57:18,649 --> 01:57:20,489
Chat plays Hitman 2.

1824
01:57:20,489 --> 01:57:22,989
I wasn't allowed to be here, apparently.

1825
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:25,279
Hey, you.

1826
01:57:25,279 --> 01:57:25,840
Hey, you.

1827
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:26,640
Hey, you.

1828
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:27,119
Hey, you.

1829
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:28,800
Excuse me.

1830
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:47,760
Oh, that's a briefcase.

1831
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:51,479
I got caught.

1832
01:57:52,359 --> 01:57:59,439
That just backfired completely.

1833
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:11,100
I can't really go down from here.

1834
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,460
I have to like sneak over there.

1835
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,420
Let me try this one more time.

1836
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:23,369
I got one person.

1837
01:58:24,329 --> 01:58:24,970
Wait, what?

1838
01:58:26,439 --> 01:58:26,760
What?

1839
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:48,279
That took so long to get there.

1840
01:58:56,829 --> 01:59:07,260
Oh, this game is fucking ridiculous.

1841
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:09,579
I didn't know I could throw it from this far away.

1842
01:59:09,579 --> 01:59:11,819
Look, what happens if I just throw the suitcase from right here?

1843
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:15,579
Can I like target somebody down there?

1844
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:29,289
This is not going to reach, so it's not even.

1845
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,680
Wait, hold on.

1846
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:33,600
I can lock on to somebody over there.

1847
01:59:34,159 --> 01:59:36,779
Hold on a second.

1848
01:59:36,779 --> 01:59:37,579
Did you hear that?

1849
01:59:37,579 --> 01:59:38,460
That's weird.

1850
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:46,010
Hold on a second.

1851
01:59:46,649 --> 01:59:53,880
Throw a coin.

1852
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:58,649
I'm so happy he found this out.

1853
01:59:59,949 --> 02:00:01,869
Well, I mean, at this point, I'm just fucking dicking around.

1854
02:00:01,869 --> 02:00:06,199
So, so hold on.

1855
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:11,310
I'm currently on locked on to somebody down there.

1856
02:00:11,310 --> 02:00:13,789
Can I go all the way across, like all the way that way?

1857
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:24,890
Catching something.

1858
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:25,449
Okay, hold on.

1859
02:00:34,409 --> 02:00:35,369
Holy shit.

1860
02:00:42,729 --> 02:00:43,529
That's insane.

1861
02:00:46,649 --> 02:00:47,930
I almost hold on a minute.

1862
02:00:47,930 --> 02:00:49,609
What if I scare everybody and then do it?

1863
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:56,760
Is it possible that I could scare everybody, throw it?

1864
02:00:57,319 --> 02:01:09,149
Is it only the briefcase or can I do it with this?

1865
02:01:09,789 --> 02:01:10,909
Oh, man.

1866
02:01:10,909 --> 02:01:11,710
Okay, hold on.

1867
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:20,409
Okay, here you go.

1868
02:01:20,970 --> 02:01:22,359
Are we going to run?

1869
02:01:31,899 --> 02:01:32,380
Not yet.

1870
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:37,869
I need to scare everybody.

1871
02:01:39,149 --> 02:01:43,039
Come on.

1872
02:01:43,039 --> 02:01:44,859
Here we go.

1873
02:01:44,859 --> 02:01:50,920
Where did it go?

1874
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:03,340
I got to get this group to run.

1875
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:11,899
Now, it's just a random person ducking.

1876
02:02:11,899 --> 02:02:13,180
That guy was already on the ground.

1877
02:02:20,359 --> 02:02:20,840
Gone.

1878
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:21,159
Got him.

1879
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:58,600
No, one flyover.

1880
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,880
Take them all you got.

1881
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:04,569
I was hoping I could get like pushed off.

1882
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:08,920
All right.

1883
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:12,029
I think I'm going to go back here.

1884
02:03:17,609 --> 02:03:18,569
It's time.

1885
02:03:18,569 --> 02:03:19,449
I think it's time.

1886
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:26,119
End of stream, voice.

1887
02:03:26,119 --> 02:03:31,850
Go back to Quiet Man.

1888
02:03:34,779 --> 02:03:37,260
Yeah, I'm sorry that the technical problems kind of

1889
02:03:37,899 --> 02:03:39,739
threw it under the bus when we moved to Hitman,

1890
02:03:43,079 --> 02:03:46,409
but Quiet Man didn't last long.

1891
02:03:46,409 --> 02:03:49,770
Well, it lasted long enough and then everybody voted for me to get off Quiet Man

1892
02:03:49,770 --> 02:03:53,289
and I went to Hitman and then my computer couldn't handle it for some reason.

1893
02:03:57,470 --> 02:03:58,750
Now, let me get out of here for a second.

1894
02:03:59,310 --> 02:04:00,720
No, I want to see the credits.

1895
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,039
That was all we're going to do with Hitman.

1896
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:09,720
Thanks for watching Hitman.

1897
02:04:14,970 --> 02:04:21,770
And one second.

1898
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:41,520
You could have just finished a game people aren't playing much and it was.
