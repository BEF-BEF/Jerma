1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:20,820
All right, so what's the plan? PC gaming show trailers? What were the trailers that were worth

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:30,920
watching? Play Five Nights at Freddy's VR. I could probably, okay, instead of a top five list of

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,840
things to do, I'll give you a top five list of things I'm not going to do, and that's number

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:48,149
one. Okay, um, let me see what are some of the trailers that I missed from earlier. Let's see,

5
00:00:48,229 --> 00:01:02,380
PC gaming show. PC gaming show trailers. Let's just put, maybe there's a compilation. Anybody,

6
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:12,310
is there a compilation? I didn't see any of it. I heard that like Terraria broke or something,

7
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:36,040
right? Play Uno. I'm not going to play Uno. Oh, is it like a site that has it all? Oh,

8
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:46,120
geez. Okay. Uh, oh God, there's a ton of random shit on this website, huh?

9
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:55,719
Play Uno. I don't even, I don't know how to play Uno. I've never played Uno before,

10
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:12,889
maybe twice in my whole life. Play Just Dance. Man Eater. All right, hold on. Wait, wait, I'm

11
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:22,379
messing this up myself. I gotta get this on screen and we'll go through it together.

12
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:39,879
So I just click on one of these and then we just, we go. Oh shit, this is pretty nifty.

13
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:55,270
This is a cool website. The tweet, no, I saw the tweet. I talked about it already.

14
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:10,539
I have talked about the tweet already. It's like from like this worst joke from yesterday,

15
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:19,099
but it's all right. Let me do this and get this on screen and then we start interacting with it.

16
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:38,229
Did it work? Hey, look at that. So now I should be able to do this, right?

17
00:03:38,870 --> 00:04:03,719
So this is from, can I not? Oh shit. Oh, Ray-Ban. I fucked it up. Watch myself

18
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,620
watching the conference. No, this is, I don't, let's move on from this. What am I going to open

19
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:20,709
right now? I don't, it didn't have any plan. Okay. Actually, I can do this. This'll work. This'll

20
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:49,029
work. This'll work. I got it. I got it. I got it. Everyone, everyone can relax. I got it. There

21
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:57,879
it is. You see it? You can see that, right? Oh, there we go. I don't know why that wasn't

22
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:26,649
working before. Everything's under control. Hey, this ain't my first rodeo. Okay. This

23
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:32,519
needs to be moved a little. I don't know why. What the hell are you doing? Fuck it.

24
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:41,110
Whatever. Whatever. All right. So let's go back here. So I, this is the midnight ghost

25
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:55,529
hunt. This is just from earlier today, right? Shave your head on stream. I don't think I will.

26
00:05:55,529 --> 00:06:04,740
All right. Let's try midnight. You guys want, you guys want to decide what trailer I watch?

27
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,259
I'm going to just watch them. There's no like pick which one I'm going to watch. Midnight

28
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:33,860
ghost hunt. Here we go. Wait, you get to like haunt objects.

29
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,730
This is prop hunt. It's actually prop hunt.

30
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,579
Somebody decided to finally make a game about this six years later.

31
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:23,079
Oh my God. That's unbelievable actually that it took this long. People still play this?

32
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:38,899
Yeah. Sign up for the alpha. More videos. Well, we don't need more videos. Wait, there's more.

33
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:56,139
Something like this could be really, people could get really, really into. Okay. That's that

34
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:03,370
one. That was midnight ghost hunt. Seems pretty fun. If you like prop hunt, you probably like

35
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:14,279
that one. Unexplored to the Wayfarer's legacy. Is this a VR game? Let us click. Are you guys

36
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,480
going to riot in here? Is that what's going to happen? You're just freaking out about this.

37
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,819
I took away these privileges for a very specific reason because people were being very,

38
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:36,779
very inappropriate with me. All right. Don't make me take it away again.

39
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,860
By the way, I'm going to skip things that I don't really care that much about

40
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:50,620
because I get my, you know, I get to look for, I'm going to give you, for instance,

41
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,620
I don't really, I don't care about mutants year zero. So I'm not going to click it.

42
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:58,779
So just be aware of that. I'm not going to watch it because I don't really, that doesn't,

43
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:02,779
I'm not into it. I can, it's like a, I got a TV channel changer in the hand of my remote.

44
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:18,490
All right. Fine. Go ahead. Go away from me. I'm going to have watched that one anyways.

45
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:26,460
I'm like, what's the, okay. Let me be honest with you here. What's the point of the smart

46
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,320
clicks? If one, two, three, four, five, six, it's like spread out. I'm going to

47
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:46,019
watch them all except for mutant year zero. Wait, there's another page. Oh Jesus.

48
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:59,179
Uh, well, we already did this. I saw this. I'm just going to watch them all. I'm just,

49
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:01,820
okay. I'm going to watch the ones that I don't know anything about. You ready?

50
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,179
All right. So I watched Terraria because you guys picked Terraria and then I'll show you.

51
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:10,980
Ready? Interested in this one. All right. I already know what that one is. Uh, I don't

52
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,419
play into the gungeon, but probably fun. Not going to be watching that one. So we got one

53
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,100
carrying. I'll watch this one. Messenger picnic panic. I don't know what it is.

54
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,220
Looks interesting. Maybe I'll watch it. My friend, Pedro, I guess I'll watch that one.

55
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:27,879
Borderlands two DLC. I have no interest of watching this. So no, uh, the final fantasy

56
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:35,269
seven remake. Sure. Destroy all humans. Already saw it. I already logged before E3.

57
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:40,259
Let's start with, uh, Terraria though, because everyone wants to see Terraria.

58
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:58,789
Where, where is it? What the fuck is that? What is that? All right. Um, what is that?

59
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:09,750
I got to go back to page one to click on Terraria. Terraria,

60
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:43,899
let's see what it is. Is this expansion? Terraria was really cool. My only problem with Terraria was

61
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:49,669
I was kind of overwhelmed because they added so much shit to it.

62
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:56,330
Would this be a good time to start playing it? Or is it just adding a ton more stuff?

63
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:08,340
Like, see what I mean? Look, look at all this stuff. Looks pretty cool.

64
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:21,100
Master mode. Look at this. Looks just so fun and so interesting. This is someone's bosses

65
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:38,360
and this is very overwhelming game though. You can fly kites. That's awesome. Coming 2019. Okay.

66
00:12:39,000 --> 00:13:00,620
That looks good. All right. What the hell is meat fortress meat fortress with the gracious

67
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:16,220
permission of valve. Oh, it's a, okay. Hot dogs, horses, hand grenades update.

68
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:31,399
We can use all the TF2 items. I'll play this when it comes out. Definitely.

69
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:47,240
Three meaty modes of mayhem. I might as well try it. You actually have to load this sniper.

70
00:13:51,429 --> 00:14:10,440
I would try it. That's so cool. That is really fucking cool. That's soon too. That's like,

71
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:19,940
what, what, when is that? Is that like in a week or two? Dog two, dog two, dog two, dog two.

72
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:43,299
What's dog two? Why is everyone saying dog two? Dog two? Where is it? Dog two. Where was dog one?

73
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:59,690
I don't remember playing dog one. Dog two. No, I know. We already saw this. Dog two. Oh,

74
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:10,659
it's a raid. Oh God. Joel coming in with a raid. Happy, happy E3 everybody. Dog two. That's

75
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:24,710
what we say here. This website is 2019.e3recap.com. Pretty cool. You can see every trailer. It's all

76
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,309
there right for you. I hope you had a good stream, Joel. Thanks for the raid. The shitloader you

77
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:36,570
just dropped in. I did not see any of the PC gaming conference, so we're going to take that

78
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:46,980
time to look at it now. And we're, where, where, where, where, where were we? Dog one?

79
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:58,259
Were we dog one? All right. So, uh, where are we? I don't, I don't, I already know, but fall guys.

80
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:18,980
Let's take, let's do fall guys. Is this de blob? Why does this look like this? 87 fall guys in

81
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:29,220
the main. This looks, this is like de blob. Oh, they got a turkey. That's an instant

82
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:49,830
vibe for me. Is it like Lemmings? What, you got like a hundred people and you got to get through?

83
00:16:50,789 --> 00:17:00,759
Or is it like a massive multiplayer? Everybody jumped from, well, it's a death run. Okay.

84
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:11,400
How many people can play at the same time? All right. Uh, this looks fucking cool. I'm

85
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:22,759
excited about this. A hundred people. All right. I'm going to play the hell out of this.

86
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:37,740
I am absolutely going to play this. That looks awesome. That's like a BR,

87
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:49,220
but a BR that I would actually enjoy playing. Chivalry two. All right. So that was fall guys.

88
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,180
I don't need to see that. Uh, I don't play under the gungeon, so we're going to veto that

89
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,299
one. I don't really, I don't really know what any of this even means because I don't play it.

90
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:19,690
Uh, what is this carrying? I was going to say hell and then fuck at the same time. So it was

91
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:51,930
like, what the fuck? Shit. Do you just grow as a parasite? That looks, why do these games

92
00:18:51,930 --> 00:19:07,299
all look better than any of the games I saw already? Why is the PC gaming stuff cooler than

93
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:18,660
guy with backpack on five times? Wait, gungeon is, it's not, and it is like a,

94
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:29,369
this is not DLC for the dungeon. It's a light gun game. Oh man. I'm going to destroy this.

95
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,250
Do I have to buy the cabinet?

96
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:56,119
You have to buy this. I have to buy the cabinet coming exclusively to arcades.

97
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:03,529
How is it? Oh, what? I got, I got a tax write off coming up here soon.

98
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:19,930
That's really awesome. It's too bad that it's only in arcades. I would love to play that.

99
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:31,420
So that was here. Should I click this? We're right here. Release date trailer. Let's see.

100
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:38,359
This is embark on a perfect ninja vacation. You can pre-order one for five grand.

101
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:42,819
That's a $5,000 joke that I'm not sure I actually want to do.

102
00:20:43,779 --> 00:21:13,529
All that. Bosses. Yeah, I mean, it's cool. It's cool. But is it, I don't know if I would buy it

103
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:16,490
because it's not like kind of the kind of game that I would play, but it looks good.

104
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:26,940
Not sure what's going on down there. You in trouble? Not sure. Bone works? Yeah,

105
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,019
we'll get to it. We'll get to it. Hold on. I'm just browsing through. Don't need to see

106
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:35,980
this. I already saw this trailer before, so I don't really need to see it again.

107
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:42,740
Final Fantasy VII Remake. I already, I don't like it. Do I really need to? Is Cat Sith in

108
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:54,339
this trailer? Otherwise, I don't even want to click it. Like, is Cat Sith in the trailer?

109
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,700
No. Then, then fuck it. I already saw this one. The Legend of Heroes II. No, not interested.

110
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:12,839
Persona 5 Royale. Oh, I have, hold on. Hold on a second. I need to, I gotta see this shit.

111
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,559
Persona 5 Royale. Like, this is a Battle Royale Persona 5 game. They have like four

112
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:29,619
different Persona 5s. There's like Persona 5 Dancing, Persona 5 The Game, Persona 5 Starlight.

113
00:22:33,559 --> 00:23:00,789
This is a long trailer. Do I need to know the story to care about this? All I know is that

114
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:15,529
the Joker is in Super Smash Bros. the new one. Stop watching anime on stream. I'm gonna get

115
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:33,059
DMCA clenched. I don't care. Like, maybe I would if I played the original game or something. No,

116
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:39,640
I don't, I just, I don't really care. It's probably, I, Persona 5 Royale, like,

117
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,480
I don't even know what it is. Lord of the Rings Adventure Card Game. I refuse to click it.

118
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:51,400
Dance Central VR. Dance Central is the hottest club in virtual reality.

119
00:23:52,359 --> 00:24:00,839
It's the hottest club. This is how it starts. This is how they keep you in your room forever.

120
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:09,160
I want to play this. In addition to practice mode, customizing your avatar,

121
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,240
competitive and cooperative online multiplayer, we have some exciting new features coming to Dance

122
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:19,160
Central. Playing Dance Central can be a workout. It's definitely a great game for fitness,

123
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,039
so we created the fitness app. And the fitness app allows you to track your calories burn

124
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:29,559
in real time as well as your stats over time. A huge part of the experience in Dance Central

125
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,359
is dancing with the characters. Currently, your friends can challenge you to beat their scores,

126
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,000
but now the characters are going to challenge you. You think you look really cool in the

127
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,720
game, but in real life, in real life you're doing this. And finally, we're releasing

128
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,960
six songs as DLC. So if you've mastered all 32 on the soundtrack,

129
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,519
no problem. We have more content coming your way. Dance Central is available now for the

130
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:05,579
Oculus Quest, Quest S, and Rift. So pick it up. Did I get the wrong one? Did I get the

131
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:16,819
wrong one? Dance Central can be a workout. Can be a workout. I got the vibe and they're

132
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:21,140
coming out with like the valve is coming out with one. The Oculus is coming out with a new

133
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:26,099
one. HTC is coming out with like a new one. Did I get the vibe? Did I get the wrong fucking

134
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:39,029
one? All right. So that was just Dance Central, the soul keeper. I'm into the VR stuff really.

135
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,869
I can't hear either. I just try to turn it up. I've been betrayed.

136
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:06,059
AMD starts at three Pacific. Really? I better go fucking pee.

137
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:11,779
All for the sake of evil. I'm supposed to be watching these trailers. What am I doing?

138
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:22,200
I just peed. Yeah, but I'm pounding coffee like I'm getting paid to do it. Like I'm

139
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,190
getting paid per cup of coffee I'm drinking. Somebody's like, I'll give you 50 bucks for

140
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:36,390
every fucking large coffee you drink. All right. Thanks, man. Can I use your bathroom?

141
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:58,380
This looks kind of good. This looks pretty, I like this. You can ride a dragon in VR.

142
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:19,130
That's puke inducing. I can't wait. I mean, a little bit of some graphical frame issues here.

143
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:35,420
This looks really slow and chuggy, but as a game, it could be really fun. All right. I mean,

144
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:46,099
this is a guarantee on the channel game. Guaranteed. Like I'm 100% guaranteed that I

145
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:55,450
play this state to stay informed. The soul keeper VR. All right. Write that one down

146
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:01,180
because that's 100% guaranteed to be on the channel. All right. AMD starts in 10 minutes.

147
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,220
Was that, did I get lied to? Or is that, are they doing anything? What are they doing?

148
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:23,930
Hold on. Let's see. They're just going to show graphics cards. I guess. Should I buy AMD

149
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:34,359
like stock before this happens? Should I buy some AMD or should I like sell my AMD before

150
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:42,920
the conference? I don't know. All right. Bone works. People saying bone work. I've heard about

151
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:50,920
this in the knuckle controllers, right? Yeah. This is going to be completely outrageous. I

152
00:28:50,920 --> 00:29:17,819
can't wait. This is, I can't, I, this is going to be so much fun. Stress levels zero.

153
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:26,309
I've seen like the developer video on that. That's going to be, that's going to be the

154
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:33,380
best VR game that's ever come out probably in regards to just usability. All right. So

155
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,160
should, should I get ready for the, can I stream the AMD conference?

156
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:51,779
Should I do it? Wait, no. Can I? I feel like there's like 7,500 people here. If I can't do

157
00:29:51,779 --> 00:30:00,069
this, they're going to find out. You know, you can't like rob a bank like, and before,

158
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:03,109
excuse me, I'm telling you, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to call my mother. I'm

159
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:06,549
going to call the police station first. I'm about to rob the bank down the street just

160
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:21,099
in case you're wondering. All right. Okay. Okay. Good. That's going to be boring. We'll

161
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:25,339
make it fun. I'll watch like these trailers as well. I'll watch these, I'll watch the

162
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:38,059
trailers as we watch the conference. No one cares about AMD. What? All right. Let's

163
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:43,160
watch the zoo trailer and then I have to go piss out coffee because like that's it.

164
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,319
It just coffee is, I could probably drink the, nevermind and get caffeine. You know

165
00:30:47,319 --> 00:31:01,859
what I was going to say. Uh, where's the planet zoo? I'm eating. I didn't say anything.

166
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:14,390
I just said, I just made a gesture to my face. We finally have the zoo that I wanted.

167
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:21,930
The PC gaming conference has every game that I asked for and I didn't even watch it.

168
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:34,839
No, there's no animal conflict in this, but there's, there's animals. This is going to

169
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:53,109
be fun. Build a habit for your wildlife planet zoo. Let your animals, alligators.

170
00:31:53,829 --> 00:32:05,690
This is going to be awesome. Really well done. Those animals were very, very well made.

171
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:12,869
Yeah, that looks good. All right. What was the other one? Give me, okay. Give me the

172
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:20,039
big ones. Give me the big ones. State DLC. I don't care. Trials rising. Don't really care.

173
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:27,430
We already saw them anyways. I'm Shenmue three. That's a big songs of conquest.

174
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,069
People were just screaming this as loud as they could. So let's see what this is.

175
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:53,509
Why do they look like heroes in my magic gold gem thing?

176
00:32:53,509 --> 00:33:03,500
Okay. Is this like a heroes of my magic three re-demake?

177
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:34,680
Yeah, this is, this is a heroes of my magic re-demake. All right. This is made by the same

178
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:52,259
people. No, songs of conquest. Closed alpha. It's a spiritual successor or like it's

179
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:58,470
based on, that's really cool. Played heroes of my magic and all of a sudden here comes a new one

180
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:03,109
that is based on the original ones. That's cool. All right. What else we got?

181
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:16,329
Telling lies. I need to see this. I gotta see the telling lies trailer. Explore a stolen

182
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:29,530
database of what? A private life shattered by a terrible lie. Once upon a time. It's late. I

183
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:37,530
gotta get her in the bath. I don't love you and I don't miss you. You already know too much.

184
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:46,539
Is there words to find the truth? It's late. I gotta get her in the bath.

185
00:34:47,500 --> 00:35:00,809
Love you. I love you. What? What? I've only ever been in love once.

186
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:12,119
That was by the first story? I guess I still carry a torch for

187
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:24,739
which makes me a curable romantic or underdeveloped emotional. Disciplined emotional?

188
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:30,389
Did he just wait? Hold on a minute. I'm a loyal. Underdeveloped emotional.

189
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:35,110
Oh, underdeveloped emotional. That's over here. I'm a loyal friend. I'm up. I'm here.

190
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:50,500
You're down here. I mean I'm a little bit more put together than you. Telling lies. Yeah,

191
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,920
that was too many people. Yeah, you're right. All right. What was he? A couple of other ones.

192
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:04,980
There was a few more that were very, very big ones. I'm gonna piss my pants. Oh, why did I drink

193
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:17,530
so much coffee like an idiot? Devarver bootleg? I already know what it is. That's me trying to

194
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:21,050
tell you that I haven't watched this trailer but I saw it on the Steam store and I like

195
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:28,760
know what it is. Hey, no, no, I already know what it is. Notice that I never said I watched

196
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,579
the trailer because that would be a lie and I would end up in a fucking database somewhere

197
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:38,659
going looking in the camera telling all my fucking dark deepest darkest secrets.

198
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:48,860
Sadly, forward thinking consumers like yourself should find their way to devolver bootleg.com,

199
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:54,059
which wholly unironically forwards to a Steam page for devolver bootleg. From there,

200
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:59,019
potential users will have the opportunity to pay a small fee to download the devolver bootleg

201
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:03,739
launcher. Once the download is complete, users like you can select from a wide variety

202
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:07,500
of off-brand versions of our most popular title. Off-brand. Yeah, you can play like

203
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:27,269
off-brand versions of Hotline Miami and stuff. Enter the gun dungeon. That's cool. I'm gonna

204
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:34,469
pee my pants. I actually have to get out of here for a second. Dude, I fill myself up with so

205
00:37:34,469 --> 00:39:43,510
much liquid. It's fucking unreal. I'll be right back. When even is the Square Enix

206
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:58,360
conference? AMD in one second? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

207
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:31,690
Let's just check in on AMD. AMD. Next Horizon Gaming. Where's AMD's actual stream? Do they

208
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:44,500
even have one? It's over? No, they what did the guy just get out on stage and like scream

209
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:53,460
as loud as he can into the mic? All right, hold on. AMD has like an age warning. This

210
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:59,380
broadcaster has indicated this channel is intended for mature audiences. All right, go,

211
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:17,860
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Why is it like an M rating? Is this even

212
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:33,500
working? What the fuck is happening? I have to like click the button in here. See, I told you.

213
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:39,179
Let's go ahead and get started. Are you ready? We just got here, right? Just right in the nick

214
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:45,340
of time. Okay, so look, as we just saw in the video, it's all about the porn here. What's

215
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:52,150
next? Our goal at AMD is to push the envelope on technology. And the entire team is always

216
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:58,949
asking, what's next? So whether it's what's next in PCs, or what's next in console,

217
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:03,909
or what's next in the cloud, we're going to show you some really exciting stuff

218
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:09,590
that just answers that question of what's next. So you've heard me say how much AMD

219
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:13,110
loves gamers. Why do we care about this? Have you heard me say that? We're gamers.

220
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:19,349
So we love you. And our goal is to give you exactly what you want. And you know,

221
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,989
fact is, you're the smartest and most demanding tech guys in the world. You're the smart one,

222
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:31,269
the smartest. Yes, I'm very smart. You expect the best of everything, the highest possible

223
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:39,190
frame rate, the most incredibly responsive and immersive experiences. And most importantly,

224
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,510
what do you think these days, you want to be able to play and share and have they

225
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:49,300
announced anything yet across every platform and to deliver that incredible gaming experience,

226
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,739
you actually need two things, breakthrough hardware, hold on, don't announce it yet.

227
00:42:53,699 --> 00:43:00,019
Hold on, I need to put like $40 on AMD. Come on. How much is an AMD? How much is one AMD?

228
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:05,690
You need these two to really be optimized together to create that next level of gaming

229
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:11,210
performance. And frankly, you know, sometimes the hardware gets a little ahead. And sometimes

230
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:15,210
the software gets a little bit ahead. But it hasn't always been in sync. Okay, here we go.

231
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:20,170
It's $33 for one AMD. What do you think it's going to be worth at the end of this conference?

232
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:24,250
However, starting now, hopefully not like 12. That would be like a recession.

233
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:31,369
We have the opportunity together with our partners to bring the best technology has to offer

234
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:38,059
to gaming across hardware, software and platforms. And that is our vision for gaming.

235
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:47,980
You like that? So look, it's an incredibly exciting time for gamers everywhere.

236
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:55,820
Just take a look across all of the most exciting. I just said I wanted to buy one.

237
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:01,739
I was unsure. It's truly everywhere. Just look at every category of the market,

238
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:07,900
whether you're talking about PCs, or you're talking about notebooks, or desktops, or Macs,

239
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:14,139
or game consoles, or cloud, or now I can't, the market's closed partnership between AMD and

240
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:23,260
You can't buy anything. It's the only reason why I'm on this stream. It closed at four o'clock

241
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:29,579
Eastern. Closed two hours ago. Oh god, I didn't get any buys in.

242
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:36,300
Technology, frankly, have to make very big bets. And sometimes you have to make those bets

243
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:42,619
three to five years out. And this year in 2019, what you're seeing is the results

244
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:46,940
of some of those big bets that we actually made three to five years ago.

245
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,699
Oh, there goes the yacht. We bet on seven nanometer process technology

246
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:55,980
for faster and more efficient silicon. We bet on these new engines and these engines are

247
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:03,420
incredible. Our new Zen 2 CPU core and our new RDNA graphics architecture. And frankly,

248
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:10,059
we put these things together. Am I the only person streaming this? Am I? Wait, am I the

249
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:16,940
only person doing this? That's not true. I'm not the only person streaming this.

250
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:24,230
Fans. So last month, Sony and AMD's gonna come watch.

251
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:30,070
PlayStation would be built around AMD's new gaming architectures. And we've been working

252
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:36,550
collaboratively with Sony. Get excited for this. To build a custom chip based on the Zen 2

253
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:42,230
and the next gen Radeon architectures. And we are incredibly excited to partner with Sony

254
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:48,550
to enable their vision of the next generation console. Now you also heard recently

255
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:53,829
that Google announced at this year's Game Developers Conference, Stadia,

256
00:45:53,829 --> 00:46:00,070
its new cloud streaming service. And this is also powered by AMD Radeon GPUs.

257
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:08,150
Radeon. Keyword. Just say keywords while you watch the conference. Then you're informed.

258
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:15,030
Exciting. Now let me ask, since we are at a three, how many of you caught the Xbox

259
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:22,760
event yesterday? Wait, is this actually not allowed? Is there any staff in here?

260
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,480
What you heard from Phil Spencer and the Microsoft team is they announced the next

261
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,960
amazing chapter. There are no staff here to help me. Is this not allowed? It's not allowed.

262
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:42,199
It's not allowed. It's not allowed. How do I turn it off? Stop fucking with me. Is this

263
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:57,639
actually not allowed? Why would this not be allowed? Wait. It's a lot, right? It's a lot.

264
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:04,519
To enable their vision for the future of gaming. So that's a lot of platforms to be excited about.

265
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:09,960
We're really excited about them, but as excited as we are about those platforms,

266
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,400
and guess what? AMD loves the PC platform. My audience is excited for AMD as well.

267
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:24,710
So look, for all of you who love PCs and love building your own gaming rigs and love

268
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:32,150
the best of the best of technology, today is for you. What do you think I got in my computer?

269
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,869
What do you think's in my computer, guys? We're introducing today what I would call the

270
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:39,750
ultimate gaming platform. Let's take a look. What's in my computer? And we're the only

271
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:45,909
company in the world that can really bring the best in both CPUs and GPUs. And it's

272
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:51,429
frankly an incredibly exciting time for us as well as the industry because we're introducing

273
00:47:51,429 --> 00:48:00,519
the brand new third-gen Ryzen desktop processors. I have Intel and Nvidia. And the brand new

274
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:07,000
Radeon RX 5700 series graphics cards. And what are the specs on it? So I can make sure that

275
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,239
I make $47 on my two buys. All right, let's go ahead and get started with Ryzen, please.

276
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:18,630
Here we go. Oh my god, are my AMD calls going to be worth any money?

277
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:57,820
Please be 30% faster than the previous generation. High energy music. The game. Ryzen 3000 series.

278
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:09,269
What are the specs? That was some, that was like a whoo. Are you guys excited about third-gen

279
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:18,090
Ryzen? Okay, I have to say the anticipation around third-gen Ryzen is really impressive.

280
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,690
I mean, we were pretty excited at the first-gen Ryzen launch, right?

281
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:29,980
Weren't those great products? And we actually loved the second-generation Ryzen just as much.

282
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:35,099
I thought you guys played games on computers. But when I read the comments from you guys and

283
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:40,300
the anticipation on Reddit or Twitter or across the forums about third-generation Ryzen,

284
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:45,900
it's truly spectacular to see the excitement in the community. So our goal

285
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:52,380
is very, very simple. Our goal is to give you the best. The best CPU for every gamer.

286
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:59,099
And it all starts with the CPU core, the engine. So we are so proud of Zen 2.

287
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:02,460
Ready? I need, you gotta clip this. Zen 2, our architect, just did an amazing job.

288
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,340
We're watching AMD. It is just incredible engineering.

289
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,659
We might be one of the top AMD screens right now.

290
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:10,219
I'll just give you a couple. Don't fuck this up for me.

291
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:13,980
15% instruction for clock uplift. Okay, so.

292
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,539
Double the cache size for lower memory latency.

293
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:19,579
Double the cache size is pretty good. And double the floating point,

294
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:24,380
which is really gate for creative work. 15 times two cache size, that's pretty awesome.

295
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,860
And if you think that we're really proud of the Zen 2 engine,

296
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,619
when we bring this over to the product side, it's fantastic.

297
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:33,340
Just take a look at this stack. Double to double.

298
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,980
Third-gen, it's only 320 bucks? So we are extremely excited about our

299
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,420
third-generation Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 9 stack. And if you think about it.

300
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,500
What? Ryzen 7 processors,

301
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:52,219
8 cores, 16 threads. We have the new flagship Ryzen 9.

302
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,860
Aren't Intel's like a thousand dollars?

303
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,340
The first 12-core processor for mainstream gamers.

304
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,480
And what you really see here is leadership.

305
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,639
That's pretty awesome. Holy shit.

306
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:10,199
At every single price point. That was our goal.

307
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:10,760
That's awesome.

308
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,199
So let me just show you.

309
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:13,239
Don't fuck this up for me.

310
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:15,960
A little bit of numbers, okay? Let's just start at the top of the stack.

311
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,840
And see how 3900X stacks up against the competition.

312
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:27,880
What we're comparing now is the 3900X against the competition's core i9-99.

313
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,440
What do I have?

314
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:32,039
Which by the way, is a $1200 processor.

315
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,360
What do I got in here?

316
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,159
48, 49?

317
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,800
This is a 12-core to 12-core comparison.

318
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,199
And what you see is that...

319
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:43,960
No, I don't have a 4900. I have like a 68?

320
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,969
We also win in multi-threaded performance.

321
00:51:52,969 --> 00:51:54,090
And all of this...

322
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:54,650
They're winning.

323
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,809
Is at 105 watts.

324
00:51:56,809 --> 00:51:58,730
4900 is from 2012.

325
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,679
There you go. I got an i7-6850K.

326
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:03,559
I got like a 64.

327
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:05,400
More performance, less power.

328
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,440
And by the way, it's less than half the price.

329
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,349
Whoa.

330
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:17,179
Now, I know some of you have also been wondering

331
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:20,219
just how does the 3900X perform in games, right?

332
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,469
This is the most important part.

333
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:25,190
Wake up. Wake up, everybody. Wake up.

334
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:28,070
We compare the 3900X again.

335
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,590
My hands are covered in oil, apparently.

336
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:35,030
And this is across some of the top AAA gaming titles.

337
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,469
This is in 1080p so that we can really stress the CPU.

338
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:42,710
And you just see is incredible performance.

339
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,230
That's like taking a vitamin C supplement.

340
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:44,869
Very high.

341
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:46,309
You just piss it away.

342
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:51,269
Maximum gaming performance where the CPU's job

343
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,110
is to get out of the way of the GPU.

344
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,309
And is that great or what?

345
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:56,150
It's for half the price.

346
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,800
Now, look.

347
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,400
Numbers are nice, but gameplay is much better, isn't it?

348
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,159
We're going to get gameplay from what game?

349
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:11,719
So let's actually see a real-world use case for the 3900X.

350
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,159
Not just for gaming.

351
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:14,440
We're going to show you gaming,

352
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,000
but we're going to show you what you can really do

353
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,480
when you take the 3900X for a spin.

354
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,480
And for that, let me invite Robert to the stage.

355
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,000
For that, we're going to put on Minecraft.

356
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,860
You saw the PC gaming show Terraria.

357
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,420
Robert, my shoes.

358
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,219
Thank you. Thank you.

359
00:53:28,219 --> 00:53:31,900
We've got 48,000 frames per second.

360
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,699
Choose 1080?

361
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:51,900
What's after this?

362
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:53,900
How long until Square Enix?

363
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,099
We've got like three hours until Square Enix.

364
00:53:57,099 --> 00:53:58,300
What the fuck am I going to do?

365
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,900
I'm about to eat like fucking bread on screen.

366
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:13,739
Should we go back to floor soup?

367
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,420
To YouTube at 10,000 kilobits using the slow OBS.

368
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,659
All right. Well, which is just a quality preset

369
00:54:34,659 --> 00:54:36,980
that's so far above what most processors can do.

370
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,099
We got a long way to go.

371
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:40,420
So I'm going to play something.

372
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,179
This is what a viewer would see

373
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:45,619
if we stream this game on both of these processors.

374
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:49,699
Yes, we did start the stream for the other guy.

375
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,780
I can't do heroes.

376
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,980
That'll take longer than three hours.

377
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,159
Right. That dollar on chapter five.

378
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:01,079
No, that was the magic of a 12 core processor for gaming.

379
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:04,119
You can do things that you couldn't do before.

380
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:05,719
The other guy with eight cores.

381
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,159
Sorry. All right.

382
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:09,639
So let's say I tried to sneeze it off.

383
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,440
I fucked it up.

384
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,880
Whatever. I just I just sneezed.

385
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,760
That's all that happened.

386
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:26,260
All right. Let me let's just hang out for a second.

387
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,260
I need a 12 core processor for gaming.

388
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,860
Do you believe it now?

389
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:37,019
I see if I can match it.

390
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:40,539
Look, we are just taking gaming and streaming to the next level.

391
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:42,139
This is what we want to do.

392
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:47,260
And now let's take a look at the Ryzen 7 3800X in action.

393
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,260
You know, my point earlier was that at every price point

394
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,179
we're giving gamers something special.

395
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:56,380
And this time we're comparing the 3800X

396
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,619
against the 9700K across the same titles in 1080p.

397
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:01,980
And what do you see?

398
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,820
Again, you see just fantastic framerate.

399
00:56:07,909 --> 00:56:08,550
Well over.

400
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,260
He was mining buzzwords.

401
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,300
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

402
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:22,739
There's a Mordhau update?

403
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:24,360
No, is there?

404
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,440
No, but I suck at that game.

405
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:41,289
Why is it still playing?

406
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:42,250
This shit's still going.

407
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,739
I've already closed it and it's still somewhere.

408
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:49,219
The Ryzen 5 family is just a perfect fit.

409
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,340
Right now somebody from AMD was watching the stream going,

410
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,780
I'm just leaving.

411
00:56:54,739 --> 00:56:56,500
They're like, what the fuck?

412
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,059
What are you doing?

413
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,289
Oh, I'm going to go play like kitchen simulator.

414
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,820
Watch the rest of the trailers.

415
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:14,260
Hold on.
