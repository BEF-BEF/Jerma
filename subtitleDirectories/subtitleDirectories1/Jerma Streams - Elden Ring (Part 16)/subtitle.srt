1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:08,330
Hey, what's going on? How are you? Yeah, I didn't want, I wasn't supposed to be late.

2
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:19,269
I don't know what the hell was going on with Steam. Steam was, I couldn't connect anything.

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,890
About, about to do an Elden Ring PC Steam PvP stream and they turned this off for maintenance.

4
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:34,950
They did that because I was streaming. That's why they did it. All right, so here's what we're

5
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:53,590
gonna do. Are you guys ready? Cancel the stream? No. We got an, this is exciting stuff today.

6
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,229
Today we're going to do Elden Ring PvP, but it's going to be a little different.

7
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:11,659
How it is different is I need to find champions. I need to find people that can fight

8
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:19,750
for this community and that can represent this community in a very meaningful way. Because in

9
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:27,659
a few days, tentatively, still ironing out the details, Ludwig and I are going to do an event

10
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:37,159
where we do a trial by combat. Ludwig is picking somewhere around five to seven people from his

11
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,909
community and I'm picking five to seven people from my community. And we're going to battle you.

12
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:55,459
Yes, trust me when I say I've been, I've been looking for the barf drinker. We may have a lead.

13
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:05,260
We may have a lead on the original barf drinker. I'll tell you right now, there are two slots that

14
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:12,310
I already have reserved. I just don't know where to find the other one. Then the problem with Elden

15
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:22,569
Ring, especially the multiplayer stuff, is if I ask, oh hey dude, who was this person in that stream?

16
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:32,840
5,000 of you are going to go to Rhea Lucaria and you're going to change your name and your outfit

17
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:44,939
to be that person. So this is going to be interesting. So what we have to do here,

18
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:51,340
this is the plan. These are tryouts. I have VR Josh here. He's in the game right now.

19
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,939
We're in the game. We are going to be summoning people. Sometimes it'll be a 1v1 scenario where

20
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,819
you will fight me. Maybe you'll fight Josh. Maybe we'll summon someone else and you'll fight each

21
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:14,870
other. I'm going to decide who I want to represent me in a few days. I'm ready for the guild tryouts

22
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:21,419
and not just me. I think you guys deserve to have a say in this too.

23
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,319
So we're going to pull people in and you're going to show us what you got.

24
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,939
It's either going to be yay or nay and then you're out and we're moving on to the next one.

25
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:53,750
Is this pre-recorded? Why would this be? What? Show me what you got. What's the rune level?

26
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,659
I think we're going to shoot for 125 probably. Your rune level doesn't matter right now.

27
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,830
As long as you're over 120, if you use the password we're going to give everybody

28
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,789
and it doesn't matter. But the nature of this stream, by the way, keep in mind,

29
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,110
I'm not going to summon the same person like three or four potentially times.

30
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:23,480
So we're going to go from here. If you get into the game, I know this is going to look,

31
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,240
there's probably going to be hundreds of signs down and I'm not going to get to them all.

32
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,519
So this is just going to be for fun. It's not meant to be taken seriously,

33
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,970
but I can assure you we will find a group today. How that's going to happen. Excuse me.

34
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,589
You are going to come into the game. People are asking, how the hell are you going to keep track?

35
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:50,790
Elden Ring does not keep track of that. Well, VR Josh is. VR Josh is going to have his recent

36
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:57,819
Steam players list. If you are to be considered, VR Josh is going to reach out to you and confirm

37
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,699
who you are in Discord. And obviously he's got your, you know, Steam profile, whatever.

38
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:10,970
That's the way we're going to do it. That's the easiest way. We were talking about like,

39
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,250
oh, should we just have people take like a screenshot with their hats off and like

40
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:23,189
hiding behind a cemetery or something? But people could just spoof that. So what about

41
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:34,100
reserves? Oh yeah. There'll be reserves. I'm going to pick 10 people today or maybe like seven. And

42
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,060
you're just, if three or four, you don't show up on whatever Friday or Saturday, whatever we

43
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,680
decide to do this, we'll try to make it so it can work with everybody. That's the plan. That's the

44
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,680
plan. Do you need my blood type? No. Are there Elden Ring spoilers? I haven't finished. Oh,

45
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,279
I can't even show you the screen. Um, that person, I just want to let you know. Yes, leave now

46
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,720
because I just looked up and this is what I saw. This is, yes, yes, absolutely. Um,

47
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,980
this is what I literally just saw. Hey dude, it doesn't happen to be Elden Ring spoilers.

48
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:27,610
Is there? No, not really. Ah, I wouldn't say so. I mean, I don't know. Come on. Nice hair. I have

49
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,100
to comb it. All right. So we're going to do a password. I'm going to tell you what it is.

50
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,709
I'll put it on the screen to make it easier so we can get started. We, we are currently in front

51
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:47,029
of the Church of Vows, the front door. I'm going to be putting down the, a, not the password we

52
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:54,410
were using before. This is PC. I'll make sure to put it in the, you know, in the list there.

53
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:09,000
All right. The multiplayer password is going to be no spaces, no capitals. Uh, trial by C.

54
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:21,000
Trial by C. Trial by combat. Trial by C. Don't worry. I'll spell it out for you. Trial by C.

55
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:30,660
Dr. Cheese is not what we're using today. I'm in front of the Church of Vows. Let me,

56
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:41,050
can I just comb my hair real quick? Is VR Josh even still in the game? Where is he? Josh,

57
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:49,319
you still here? Oh, Jesus. Okay. You are. All right. So we need, I need, I need gold signs

58
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,220
and I need invasion signs because how this works is there can only be two of each.

59
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:01,779
So right now Josh is an invader. So I need another invader and I need another gold sign. So

60
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:09,060
put down both. Messy hair. It's, I need a haircut. That's a problem. Uh, uh, mods.

61
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,250
Will this work if, uh, yeah, you should, you're still here, right? This should work

62
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:24,019
if we change the password. Soul level. Summoning people with a password doesn't matter. So level,

63
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:28,899
but for the actual tournament, we're probably going to say 125. That makes the most sense.

64
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:39,100
All right. Let me use this item. I'm not going to send him out. Am I? No. All right. Should I

65
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:49,259
be seeing signs or what? Do I have to do, do I have to take any other item? 125 is too low.

66
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:57,340
Is it too low? We'll figure out 150 is the new PVP cap. Oh, I need to take one of the fingers,

67
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:13,399
right? How come I can't take it? 150 is not. We'll figure it out. Password password's trial by sea.

68
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:29,700
Yes. I have to kill. Oh, I'll use the tongue. That means we can be invaded. Uh, is this, am I

69
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,620
going to be able to even have, I might have to just summon Josh, uh, with the same password, right?

70
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:42,309
Yeah. I'll put the password on screen. Good idea. Good idea. Is it cross region?

71
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,269
I think it's currently set to cross region, but I'm really going to have to disappoint everybody

72
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:57,740
here. I think, I think I'm only going to be picking North America. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

73
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,220
In fact, I'm going to have to turn that off now. I'm so sorry, everybody. Like we got,

74
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,419
we're going to have a tournament here. It's, we're going to have to be able to connect to each other.

75
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:12,230
Should I leave and rejoin? Yeah. Try, try. Let's, uh, leave and rejoin. We'll see. Let me just, uh,

76
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:32,740
got it. Okay. So yeah, this is how it's going to work. Why am I wrong? Like, okay, there we go.

77
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:40,809
Uh, let me change the region and I'm going to reload the area too. So hold on. Let me do a cross

78
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:49,779
region off. I'm sorry. I know. Oh, it's already off. Okay. We're good. All right. So I need gold

79
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:56,809
signs and I need, uh, regular signs too. See if I could find Josh again, that's going to be hard.

80
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,899
I can do some trial, uh, trials by myself, but I really need to have that recent steam players

81
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:17,620
list. I have a question. Uh, go, go gold, Josh. It's all with the password, right? It's not me.

82
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm gold. Hold on. Hold on. Yeah. With a tournament like this or having like a community fight a

83
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,000
community, I feel like we have to have it be no lag. If someone's just teleporting around,

84
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,279
I'm going to be like, what? Oh, we can't even do it. I'll put the info on screen. Bear with me

85
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:47,559
for just another second, please. Thank you. Okay. Uh, password is trial by combat and

86
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:54,820
rune level one 25 to one fifth. I, we haven't figured it out yet. It's probably, I gotta talk

87
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:07,620
to a lot of people. We're not sure yet. Uh, you see, all right, let's see if I can get Josh back

88
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:18,759
in here. Once Josh is in here, then we can really get going, but he really has to be in here first.

89
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,519
May restart it. One 25 is PVP one 50 or players who were too bad to beat the game without

90
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:44,200
over-leveling. Oh, stop. Stop it. Please. All right, Josh, where's your, uh, sign? It wasn't

91
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,899
there. All right. I got a question. So for me to see recent players that I've played with,

92
00:12:50,899 --> 00:13:03,259
I can't see it. Is there a re what do I have to do? This person is just me. If I can find you here,

93
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:15,269
shift tab, like, okay, but you can't see it in Elden ring. No, you can. You can. We confirmed

94
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:25,059
that you could just do level 70. Yeah. Recent players does work now, but I can't see them

95
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:37,610
because it has to be like, why don't you just use it? Yeah. That's what I was going to say.

96
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,460
That's why I was trying to get Josh in here so he could see it. But trying to get, we thought

97
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,830
we could get Josh in first and then switch the password. Well, here's where, okay, I gotta,

98
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,950
I got a solution. What do I do? We think about this. I'm just not going to tell you what the

99
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:56,200
password is yet and get Josh and why would we not think about this first? That was like the eat.

100
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,950
What are we crazy? All right. New password. I'm just going to give it to Josh first.

101
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,570
What the fuck am I doing? What do you mean? I'm dumb. You didn't have the idea either.

102
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:12,330
You didn't have the idea either, did you? I just should have left it at the other one. I don't know

103
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,570
what the fuck we were doing. All right. New password. I'm typing it to Josh right now.

104
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:29,299
I don't want to show you this. How, guys, how are we going to do this? I don't know. I got to

105
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:37,429
get Josh in, then I got to change the world and I get what? Just the easiest problems have the

106
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:41,750
whatever. It's the most difficult solutions have, I don't, whatever they, you know, the quote from

107
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:47,909
that fucking movie with the guys in space throwing lasers and shields and stuff. All right. Let me

108
00:14:47,909 --> 00:15:00,710
turn this off. Okay. I'm going to put that. I'm going to put the password down now. I'm excited

109
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:07,480
for this. I don't. I'm very ready for this. Why did we fucking do that? What were you doing?

110
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:15,700
Why would there be a separate password for Josh to come in? Okay. Yeah. Josh, we're going to change

111
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:28,620
that password again. Mine was too long. That one's the one we're using. That's the one we're using.

112
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:39,929
All right. Are you guys ready? Let's go. That's not the password. I could change that too.

113
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:44,549
All right. Here we go. Takes a little bit of setup. We're good. We're not ready. Yeah. I know. Hold

114
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:48,870
on. Let me just, he's in a weird mood again. I, yeah, I am because I'm excited. This is going to

115
00:15:48,870 --> 00:16:03,779
be fun. All right. Looking for your sign. Where'd you put it? So here's the plan. We are going to,

116
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:15,769
we are going to do this for a little while. After we pick a few champions, after we get who I think

117
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:23,580
is, should be there. I'm going to play Closing Shift. It's a horror game. It's area game. It's

118
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:30,139
everybody make coffee or something. All right. I can officially now show the password on screen

119
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:33,100
and I can. All right. We're good. We're good. It just takes a minute. Everyone just relax. We're

120
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:52,360
fine. Password is not trial by combat anymore. Password is frogs LUL. That is the password.

121
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:06,259
Good luck everybody. What the fuck? No, wait, why are we getting invaders? Why are we getting

122
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:12,710
invaders? I got a password. All right. We got to kill this guy like quick. Josh, try as hard as

123
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:28,059
you can and kill him now. Get this guy. Get him. Okay. All right. Okay. Why can't I see anything?

124
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:34,740
Where's my HUD? Why is my HUD off? Who turned my fucking HUD off? Why is my HUD turned off?

125
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:46,500
What? Who would do? Why would that be turned off? Oh, right. I did. All right. Here we go.

126
00:17:46,500 --> 00:18:01,829
You guys ready? Our first contestant, Goob. Welcome Goob. Goob, we're going to have you facing,

127
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:19,079
let's pick another one here. Passwords don't affect invasions. I thought you had to take the tongue

128
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,440
because if you're, Oh, right. Anyone can just invade the game. I forgot. Welcome Goob. Let's

129
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,549
take a look at you. See if I think I would want you as a, as a champion of mine. Rivers of blood.

130
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:36,230
Rivers of blood. That's an automatic disqualification. Um, thanks for playing. Josh,

131
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:44,920
if you could take care of him, please. Oh, you're not an invader. All right. You're going to be

132
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:52,140
going against, who's this? All right. Wrangledorf. Wrangledorf. I should turn off the HUD. Why is it

133
00:18:52,140 --> 00:19:02,680
on? So these are our first two. Remember, I'm looking, I'm not just looking for people that

134
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:10,089
can play the game well. I'm wait, don't, don't, not yet. Oh, I'm not looking for like, Oh wow.

135
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:14,089
What a gamer. I'm looking for people that can, you know, be able to, it's not just about like how

136
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:23,960
many times you can hit R1, right? Where is, um, look his HUD. All right. Now I want my thing.

137
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,859
All right. So here we go. Let me take a look at you. Not bad. Hey, don't fight yet. Don't fight.

138
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:35,019
That's unsportsmanlike conduct from Goob. And I don't think I'm not, I'm not happy about this.

139
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:49,640
That's unsportsmanlike conduct. What am I doing? No, I want to look, where's my binoculars?

140
00:19:52,059 --> 00:20:01,029
There it is. All right. I want, I, uh, first of all, Goob, I don't, I'm not, I'm not entirely

141
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:03,750
happy about what you just did, but I'm ready to start the fight here. If you guys could,

142
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,349
this is a, to see who may or may not be moving on. I'll consider everything.

143
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:16,380
You can go ahead and fight. You can go ahead and start now. I'm looking for a lot of different

144
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:28,900
things. I'm looking at the comedy. I'm looking at the skill. I need to back the camera up.

145
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:45,380
All right. River of Blood is banned. If you come, I'm telling, I'm going to tell you right now,

146
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,339
if you come into the trial by combat tryouts with Rivers of Blood and you kill the guy in three hits,

147
00:20:50,339 --> 00:21:00,779
you're banned. Rivers of Blood's banned. That was cool though. That was pretty cool. I like the

148
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:06,119
armor. I like the getup. I like the idea. Uh, but we have, I mean, we have to find someone that can

149
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:27,029
get rid of you. All right. Drew Crew for life. You've, you got a catchy name. Rivers Crew. No,

150
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:33,960
no, no. If you, I, you, you, you're trying to impress me. I'm sorry, but you don't impress me

151
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:41,769
by hitting L2 three times, but wait a minute. It could be some redemption here. You forgot to call

152
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:50,490
us Drew Crew for a year. Okay. I'm not against having somebody with Rivers of Blood by the way.

153
00:21:50,490 --> 00:22:04,650
Okay guys, go for it. Let me see what you can do. Let me see what you got. I like the weapon choice.

154
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:23,299
Oh my goodness. Crawl. All right. Okay. That was actually amazing. Congratulations. You're the first

155
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:27,059
person that's being considered, but not quite yet. We're going to have to have the, we're going to

156
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:37,450
have to have the chat vote on you, I think. All right. We need, uh, we need another gold sign.

157
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:50,470
We've got Drew Crew looking good. We need some gold signs. I might need to, uh,

158
00:22:50,470 --> 00:23:06,490
okay. There we go. Who's this? Okay. Anna. Anna, go for it. Put on Tekken music. And by the way,

159
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,150
the environments are going to change too. We're not just going to sit here. Like I have to see

160
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:17,480
how people can handle this. Uh, yeah. Can we please keep, um, like, can we please keep the Drew Crew

161
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:30,569
for later review, please? That's for later review. Okay. Anna, let's see what you got.

162
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:49,619
Please help. That's funny. Uh, you two can go ahead and get started whenever you want.

163
00:23:49,619 --> 00:24:09,259
Good. Oh shit. Fire move. That move is sick. What just happened? What the fuck was that?

164
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:38,250
Okay. You killed me. No, no, we have to redo this. No. I have to, I have to re-summon Josh

165
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:49,380
with a new password. All right. Put that one on the consideration list. Put that one on the

166
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:59,859
consideration list for sure. All right. We're going to move area. Drew Crew is currently saved.

167
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:09,480
We're going to pull them out later too. Uh, Drew Crew, if you're here, I would stick around. Uh,

168
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,369
but I need to make a new password and we're going to move area too. Uh, let's go over here. Let's

169
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:29,589
go. What's a place that like not a lot of people will be that's like kind of open in the snow area?

170
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:37,130
What about, yeah, what about like right here somewhere? Lindell? Outer wall of Lindell?

171
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,720
Yeah, that's probably not a bad idea. Like you mean like out here? Like at the rampart?

172
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,420
What do you mean like in here somewhere? Is 156 a room? Look, the room level doesn't really matter

173
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:57,980
that much. We're, we're trying to find some community champions here. Play Radegon's theme

174
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:15,900
during battles. Okay. I like that a lot. At least for a few. Uh, the one left. Okay. Let me get a

175
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:26,039
new password for Josh and then that password's changing. All right. New password. It turns off.

176
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:39,220
The one left near the outer wall. Do I even have the outer wall? Okay. Yeah. Outer,

177
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,400
outer wall battleground is where we're going to go. I gotta get a new password.

178
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:56,490
You killed me, man. I'm not gonna have to consider that. It's so funny because there's no way we're

179
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,809
going to actually get like, oh yeah, let's get like some like people to do that. I'm just picking

180
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:05,130
like the five like fucking biggest dickheads and like that's who's going in. It doesn't really

181
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,619
matter. It's just for fun. All right. New password. I got to change it. I don't want you guys to see.

182
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:18,539
New lake of rot. Yeah. Guys, I'm, trust me when I say this is going to be very, very,

183
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:25,019
we have to consider a lot. Once we narrow down some people, we're putting them in weird scenarios.

184
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:32,789
We're putting these people in strange scenarios. So don't worry. I, I gotta give Josh this new

185
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:55,750
password so we can log. Um, this is fine. Okay. That's the password, Josh. Use it. I'll get you

186
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:07,619
in and then I'll show it on stream. And I am right here, Josh, by the way. This is an interesting

187
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:14,059
place because there's a lot, this, um, verticality here, this area right down here. I think it's

188
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:29,299
perfect. You can be outside of it by a few levels. Uh, all right. I need to wait. I need to press the

189
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:53,609
button. Yeah. You can be outside of it. Where is, where's your sign, Josh, the fire, get the right

190
00:28:53,609 --> 00:29:09,259
password, right? I hope I have the right password. I sent it to you, right? I need to reset it. Yeah.

191
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:36,539
Hey, you love the drew crew. Not yet. Hmm. Ah, no. What? I rewrote it. Let's try it again. If there's

192
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:45,769
no boss, you need a red summon sign first. Really? Oh, I didn't know that. Uh, Josh, it's

193
00:29:45,769 --> 00:30:05,609
going to be red. And then I need to summon a red and a gold. That's a lie. Rest until night, but

194
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:15,509
until like noon or something. Oh, that is true. Okay. That was a lie. I feel like it's not a lie

195
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:39,980
because I can't see his sign. Use the finger. Didn't I already do it? I was reset it. Why does

196
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:51,930
it hate this place? Why does it hate this place? Maybe I gotta move. All right. Well, it doesn't

197
00:30:51,930 --> 00:31:10,819
like this place. Um, how about up here? Will this work? Consecrated Snowfield? I can't believe I

198
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:21,779
fucking killed. This should work, right? Or the Radon Festival. Oh, that's a great idea. Yeah.

199
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:35,700
We'll go over there. You leaked the password? No, I didn't. Yeah. We'll go like right over here.

200
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:46,970
That sounds good. I pay a laugh. I can't summon here. What the fuck? All right. So what's the

201
00:31:46,970 --> 00:32:05,509
thing to show the PVP areas? You, you're lying. It's like, look, what do you mean? Just go to the,

202
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,150
yeah, we're just going to go. All right. We're just going to go to an area where you can actually do

203
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:21,539
it. Church of vows is, it's kind of cramped. Academy main gate. The Academy main gate is

204
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:30,089
going to be so flooded with signs though, but sure we'll start there. That's a guarantee that

205
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:39,529
we can at least do it somewhere pretty early might be helpful for new game plus. That's true. Not

206
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:44,329
with a password. All right. Let's go to the, let's go to the main gate. I wanted to like do it in

207
00:32:44,329 --> 00:33:21,349
interesting places though. All right, Josh, put it down on the main gate. Maybe an isolated merchant

208
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:31,049
shack. You need a boss to summon golds. I feel like I need a Wikipedia to play multiplayer in

209
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:48,069
these games. I always liked that. No, I already did. Okay. Sign should be done. No, I killed the

210
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:52,380
bosses that were in, um, in front of the church of vows. I, I did everything there. This isn't

211
00:33:52,380 --> 00:34:02,789
new game plus or anything. I don't think. Let me see if I have the password right. I'd like a team

212
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:13,940
of 10 people to help do this. Yeah, that's the right password. No, no caps, no spaces, just that

213
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:29,800
word. And then that number, it just works. I have no idea why it's not working. Maybe we have to

214
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,679
just do it at the church of vows. I, it's, I, I don't get why I wouldn't, why I was working there.

215
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:43,980
All right. We're just going to go where it worked because it does not work here. I, for some reason

216
00:34:43,980 --> 00:35:06,170
let's go back to the church of vows. Why would it work there though? That's weird. It's because of

217
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:15,210
the, I didn't kill the boss. There's a secret boss here. Oh, what the fuck? Okay. I'm very irritated

218
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:23,860
by this, by the way. Very irritated. I just want to play multiplayer. What the heck is going on

219
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:30,969
here? All right. We have to do it in a place where I have not killed a boss. Apparently there's a boss

220
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:42,869
here at night that I didn't kill yet. Holy smokes. Haven't put a red down. Yeah, that didn't work

221
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:58,679
either. Why was this working flawlessly last time we did this? All right. There we go. All right.

222
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:04,679
Let's go. All right. The password, the password is cookies three. Okay. It's fucking cookies three

223
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:37,460
from software. Jesus. So we need gold and red. Whatever you want to put down, please do it.

224
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:51,900
It gets cut off. No, it doesn't. Cookies three. What do you mean? All right. Who do we got? Oh,

225
00:36:51,900 --> 00:37:01,000
here comes, here comes cinnamon. What? The three is cut off. How would the three be cut off if I

226
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:14,809
have it right here? What? Oh, I'm mad right now. All right, Josh, we have an invader and they're

227
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:23,929
going to fuck this whole thing up. So, uh, are you, are you, okay. Point to the ground if you are

228
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:43,610
wanting to be considered to be a champion. Josh, get him, get him, get him. This is random invader.

229
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:54,789
Get him. Don't let him screw this up. How are you? Wait, what? You can't find the emote.

230
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,719
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let up, let up, let up, let up, let up for a second, Josh.

231
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:10,869
Point. Okay. Point to the ground if you want to be considered. He doesn't have the emote. How do

232
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:16,380
you, don't you get that in like the first fucking 10 minutes of the game? All right. Do an emote

233
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,820
if you want to be, there we go. All right. You want to be considered. That's fine. Let's get somebody

234
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:29,849
to fight you. What do you know what your name is? Cinnamon. All right. Do we have a fire, fire, fire,

235
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:43,750
fire? I'm interested. That's rude. I don't know. Somebody could just invade and kill us both and

236
00:38:43,750 --> 00:39:02,920
we have to redo the whole thing again, man. Hey. All right. I wish you both the absolute best of luck

237
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:52,489
and get started. Pretty cool. Oh shit. That was fucking pretty cool. All right. Stick around,

238
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:59,800
stick around for now. We need some red signs. This camera work is why you'd never worked out

239
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:11,559
as a wedding photographer. Listen, I, I just imagined like, I don't know why somebody would

240
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:16,119
have like, like their wedding video would have the Radegon theme for some reason.

241
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:23,739
Like you really like this game. All right. We need some red signs. What do we got here? Who's this?

242
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:46,139
Storm blessed. Maybe, maybe metal mesh. Zeke. Maybe there's Wrangledorf again,

243
00:40:46,139 --> 00:41:03,260
Rachel convo breaker. Hmm. What do you guys think? Convo breaker sounds like a good idea.

244
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:11,380
All right guys, let me get a good spot. I need something like kind of high up, like up here.

245
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:29,769
Can I get like up on the roof somehow? Up on the rock. All right. Don't do anything yet.

246
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:39,210
I'm going to get up on the rock. Maybe I should get on this rock over here.

247
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:47,750
I love, we got to, we got to take a look at you. Hey, going on convo breaker. You two, uh, currently

248
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:56,860
this is a pretty interesting consideration here. Give up the hillside. All right. Follow me. This

249
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:14,550
is where we're putting the signs down now. I'm going to get up here. That's way better. Yeah,

250
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:20,900
that's better. All right. Once you start hearing the music that you guys can start to get started

251
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:42,090
here. Good luck. Congratulations. Uh, have a good fight. Oh, they, all right. They both have

252
00:42:42,090 --> 00:43:02,059
similar moves. Oh, that was huge. Nice job convo breaker. Fire, fire, fire. I want to put you on

253
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:09,960
the considered list though. Excellent work. Let's get you in again. I want to get another look at

254
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:20,139
you. Are potions allowed? Yeah. Fuck it. Yeah. You can drink potions. Who cares? These are triodes,

255
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:33,130
right? You can drink potions. Yeah. Just chug them. Who gives a fuck? By the way, uh, convo breaker.

256
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:37,769
Um, we're going to eventually, we're going to, when we narrow this down a little bit more,

257
00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:47,369
we might be in contact. It was like a fucking college application, like a job application.

258
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:50,889
By the way, we'll be in contact shortly. Potentially. Maybe not. Don't call us though.

259
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:55,449
We may get in touch with you. We're thinking about it. Be aware. We might reach out. What the fuck am

260
00:43:55,449 --> 00:44:09,139
I talking about? I need some signs. Gold signs. Let's see what we got. What's your name? You got

261
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:19,340
a pretty crazy setup. So I'm going to, we'll go ahead and say, yeah, we'll call you. Don't allow

262
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:45,900
healing. No Estes. No, anything, anything goes. Stay in one spot. Well, I don't see any signs here.

263
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:55,349
Hey. All right. Come on over here. You're going up against convo breaker. Uh, come a little bit

264
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:07,960
further back. The rock. Estes isn't fair. Uh, yeah. I mean, we're not, um, we're trying to see how you

265
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:18,329
handle certain scenarios, scenarios. Okay. Uh, good luck to you. We'll get you the music. Once

266
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:44,980
you hear the music, you go ahead and start. Got a gun here. Not a bad start. That's the spinning

267
00:45:44,980 --> 00:46:01,500
wheel, the pizza wheel. All right. We've got, we've got a contender here. Uh, I think we have quite

268
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:14,420
a contender. Use a controller. Yeah. The issue is it's like alt tabbing. What does it shift? How do

269
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:25,670
I like make it so I don't have to cycle, right? The person that stays has less Estes. That's true.

270
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:31,269
If tab, right? Just don't alt tab. But I need to play the music. All right. Let's grab another

271
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:35,429
one. Uh, any signs over here yet? Not really. I think they're all going to concentrate over here.

272
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:45,670
I'm telling you right now, uh, convo breaker, if you go three for three here, I'm going to have to

273
00:46:45,670 --> 00:47:00,969
very put you at the top of the list to wildly consider it. Your own battle music. I mean,

274
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:09,500
three for three. That's a big deal. Um, I don't see any more signs. Reuse the item. Uh, I think

275
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:15,639
we have to refresh after this, which is fine. It looks like we're bringing in Zeke. Oh, no. Hold

276
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:40,840
on. Yeah. All right. Zeke, come on and play the flute for battle music. It's this is Zeke, the

277
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:57,530
freak plays Shito. I don't even, I don't even know where she is. All right. Come over to the rock.

278
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:07,059
All right. We got convo breaker versus Zeke, the freak. This is to solidify. Convo breaker

279
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:20,760
is going to be absolutely considered. I'm very curious about it. Let's see. Good luck. Somebody

280
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:34,469
has to, uh, no, no, get that shit out of here. It's going to kill me. Get that out of here.

281
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:54,780
Get that out of here. Oh my God. Convo breaker might actually be unbeatable. Josh is just running

282
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:10,969
back and forth. All right. Zeke convo breaker. That was, that was quite the display. I wonder

283
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:25,000
if there's any more signs. I never told them to start. I said, what's the dog doing? Oh, wait,

284
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:43,960
hold on. We got some more. Hold on. Wait a minute. Scum. The fanatic. Somebody has to beat convo

285
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:53,539
breaker. Can we just put signs down? Yes. Uh, people are wondering where we are. We are in

286
00:49:53,539 --> 00:50:02,039
front of the church of vows. So level one 25 to one 50 ish. I mean, it really doesn't matter that

287
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:16,059
much. All right. Scum. Scum. You are, first of all, you've already got the look down. You're like a

288
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:26,469
weirdo. So you've already, where are you? Where are you going? Oh, okay. You're going the right way.

289
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:37,989
Don't go yet. All right. It's kind of a weirdo. Where's the barf drinker? Where is it? Where is

290
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:42,900
the barter? If you're like looking for Batman or something, like where is Batman? All right. Hold

291
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,699
on one second. You know when to start. You're going to start when the music starts playing and

292
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:56,059
hold on. I'll tell you when that is. That's going to be in about five, four, one, zero convo breaker

293
00:50:56,059 --> 00:51:25,880
is three for three. Can scum drinker be able to do it? Badness. Oh, shit. Oh no. They're too far.

294
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:41,989
Oh, did he get him? Oh my God. Nobody can beat him. He's scared. Nobody can beat him.

295
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:59,059
Nobody can beat him. Somebody said I can beat him. We need gold signs down with that password.

296
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:16,679
Cookies three convo breaker. Um, we might actually have the first champion looking good so far.

297
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:28,630
We don't need the telescope view. I, yeah, but I like it. All right. We've got Xena of dragons

298
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:47,429
possible. Young replica. Villabalt. Arcturus. All right. Xena of dragons. Somebody has to be

299
00:52:47,429 --> 00:53:08,300
convo breaker. It's starting to get to be nightfall. He just walked past my sign. I don't

300
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:16,500
worry. I'm going to get as many people as I can. All right. I'm a breaker. How do you feel? I need

301
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:34,860
to turn this music down. We've got our own music. All right. Come on over here. Xena of dragons.

302
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:40,820
Welcome to the tryouts. I think you understand the rules here. You're going up against the

303
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:49,429
strongest champion that's shown themselves so far. That is convo breaker. I will get up here and

304
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:56,659
I'm going to tell you when to get. Uh, come a little bit closer to the rock to start. Yeah,

305
00:53:56,659 --> 00:54:04,300
you can be like 150 plus. It don't matter. Turn on cross region play. Uh, back up a little bit

306
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:15,670
towards the, uh, towards the rock. Keep coming. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up.

307
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:19,590
Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. They're just going. They're going.

308
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:41,860
I don't know what happened. I don't know what just happened.

309
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:57,130
You did it. You killed convo breaker. That was a false start. Josh, you look fucking crazy.

310
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:10,179
All right. Let's get, um, we need, uh, uh, that was cheating. All right. We got invaded. We got

311
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:20,619
invaded by trash. Everyone be on your absolute lookout here. Be on your absolute. This three of

312
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:26,360
us just be aware. This person might not have any idea what we're doing. If we could get a confirmation

313
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:32,380
from trash that they are here to compete in the competition, that would be fantastic. If we could

314
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:48,500
get an emo of you pointing down. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Come over to the rock.

315
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:54,809
Nobody start yet. If you start, you're disqualified right in front of the rock.

316
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:06,679
Those bugs look up with the bugs. All right. Oh, come over to the rock. Close to the rock.

317
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:37,739
Guys, I'm trying to. All right. You can now begin the battle. Good luck to both of you.

318
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:53,260
I can't see anything. All right. I can't zoom in anymore. Wait, maybe I can. How are you killing

319
00:56:53,260 --> 00:57:04,710
people so fast? Here's the issue. The issue is it's like 0.0.02 sensitivity. How do I make it

320
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:13,320
faster? Can I make the sensitivity faster for the camera? Yeah. Like, come on, dude. Like,

321
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:27,829
what the fuck is going on here? That's better. All right. Finally. All right. Zena now is currently

322
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:36,650
in the lead. Lock on to one of the fighters. Can you move when you're in this? Yeah, I can't move.

323
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:44,409
I can't move around. Well, not. There's no lead. Yeah, there's no such thing as a lead.

324
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:56,500
Okay. Sanders. Sanders. Come on in. See if you can beat Zeno and let me turn this off because

325
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:07,909
it's annoying and makes loud sounds. Yeah. I want to be like not even here. Isn't there a

326
00:58:07,909 --> 00:58:20,630
weapon that makes so I'm silent too? Isn't this something that makes you quiet? Okay. This one

327
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:31,349
here. Okay. So good luck to you, Sanders. Good luck to you, Zeno. Both of you are in it to win

328
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:56,230
it here. You can go ahead and get started whenever you both comfortable. Oh, my God. Good start.

329
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:13,429
That thing is instantly killing it. I'm on their team. It's okay. All right. This is a bubble

330
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:28,440
character. Oh, you're dead. It's over. Oh, no. You definitely rotted by now. Fucking move, dude.

331
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:53,909
Is that ever going to hit? Oh, man. Okay. Zena now is really difficult. Sanders is dead. Nice try.

332
00:59:53,909 --> 01:00:01,500
What level is Zena? That's a good quick. Could you be like, it's not possible for Zena to be

333
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:14,630
like level like 500, right? Oh, yeah. Let's go. Nancy Drew. I need Nancy Drew's fucking theme song,

334
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:31,909
whatever it is. Ladies and gentlemen, you're competing for the first time.

335
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:53,619
Nancy Drew. Hey. Okay. Nancy Drew, meet Zena, the dragon, who will win this Nancy Drew,

336
01:00:53,619 --> 01:01:14,090
just a detective, just a detective in high school or a dragon warrior princess. Good luck. Begin.

337
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:35,800
Oh, that's so much distance. Come on, go over there and solve the mystery.

338
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:57,800
Nancy Drew. Just that's like a fucking leg of a chair. Oh, shit. This is all that's in Nancy

339
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:18,469
Drew's inventory. I've got a piece of a fence. Nancy Drew's dead. All right. I think Zena's got

340
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:37,269
to be considered. Looks like she couldn't solve that mystery. No, nobody's got to come in.

341
01:02:37,269 --> 01:02:46,070
Is Zena over leveled? I don't know. Maybe. I don't know. Magic is good. Put HUD on for damage

342
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:57,369
numbers. How do you check level? Is level scaling if you use a password? Apparently,

343
01:02:57,369 --> 01:03:04,360
she's level 125. Yeah, she's not over level. She's not 713. All right. Any more signs or we're going

344
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:22,010
to have to refresh? Oh, there's a bunch in here, isn't there? This is PC. Yeah, we need to refresh.

345
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,699
It should scale. All right. Yeah. So we shouldn't be a problem then. All right. We're going to have

346
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:35,420
to refresh. Zena, please take Zena's name down. They're going to be considered. Considered.

347
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:59,210
You have no U.S. friends. What? Okay. Zena, you're going to have to help her. Minus what?

348
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:34,340
Tip? Should I put clothes on? To the right, to the right, to the right. Good sir. Are you here

349
01:04:34,340 --> 01:05:01,159
for the Tournament of Champions? All right. Let's start this. That was like a little kid

350
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:06,760
just wandered over. That was just like, what was that? We were like, we were like, some just kid

351
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:20,329
just walked over. He's like, what are you guys doing over here? What the fuck was that? Disqual.

352
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:38,019
All right. Stinky. I got high hopes that Stinky. Where's the barf drinker? We need to put a bat

353
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:52,070
signal up in the sky for the barf drinker. Do you want me to DM barf drinker? Yes. All right, Stinky.

354
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:59,019
Good luck. Come over here. You're probably going to die in one hit. That was so funny.

355
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:09,619
This shield and sword didn't even die. We couldn't even say hello. All right, Stinky. Let's go.

356
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:16,599
I'm very curious. Let's make it happen. You are going up against the strongest character so far,

357
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:35,940
besides Convo Breaker. I don't think you're going to win. I don't think you're going to win. All right.

358
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:39,460
I'm going to tell you guys something like, I understand the comedy points work, but when you

359
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:48,219
come in here with like toys and you're going to get killed. This guy's using a sticky hand

360
01:06:48,219 --> 01:07:14,969
from one of those quarter machines. Wait a minute. Don't speak so soon. Watch out for the... Uh-oh.

361
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:34,579
I was facing the wrong way. Easy. Stinky. This has been the hardest fight so far for Zena.

362
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:47,050
What the hell was that? Holy shit. Stinky, you got it. That's unbelievable. Nice job. Zena,

363
01:07:47,050 --> 01:08:03,210
nice job to you too. Stinky, let's see what you got. I'll keep Zena's name down as well.

364
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:16,199
Stinky did Estus three times. Not a good showing. I keep thinking about the Linus guy.

365
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:24,329
He didn't even have a chance. All right. And we need a, uh, I need a gold sign.

366
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,380
We're going to have to refresh it in a second and, uh, bring in some new people

367
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:51,640
because I want to get a cycle. Gold sign right here. Okay. Well, we've got, we've got a, um,

368
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:58,760
what we have here is we have Frosted Flakes and then next to Frosted Flakes is the off-brand

369
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:08,250
Frosted Flakes that, that nobody buys. What's going on? Except, hold on a second here. Some

370
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:15,210
of those off-brand cereals that come with the huge bags are better. Buy like a lot. They're

371
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:24,470
gone though. I don't know where they went. You could buy like a year's worth of cereal.

372
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:32,739
How come their sign is gone? All right. Puke Peddler. Let's see if, uh, hold on a minute.

373
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:40,170
Are we really going to take the off-brand, uh, barf drinker here? What the hell is this? All right.

374
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,380
All right. I, I, I've gone over this person's sign like five times.

375
01:09:46,020 --> 01:10:10,840
Hud for damage numbers. Put the HUD on for a little bit here in Cross-Region. All right. The,

376
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:17,479
hi. The reason why Cross-Region is not on is because if you're, if you got like a thousand

377
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:22,229
ping or something, then it's not going to work out for the tournament. I'm sorry. The way it is.

378
01:10:22,789 --> 01:10:36,810
All right. VillaBalt versus, uh, Stinky. You guys can start whenever you feel comfortable. Good luck

379
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:42,569
to you. Uh, VillaBalt has, uh, he's like a merchant. He has all the items in the game

380
01:10:42,569 --> 01:11:06,970
that, uh, he's probably going to block everything. Holy shit. Oh my God. This is going to be close.

381
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:33,319
Uh-oh. What is, what is he wearing on his back? Oh no. No. VillaBalt. That was so close. That

382
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:48,439
I went and put him down. Put VillaBalt down. That was actually pretty, that was cool. All right.

383
01:11:48,439 --> 01:12:02,779
Where's Puke Peddler? All right. You've had a little, let's see what you got. Like I deserve

384
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:08,619
to lose. He was using an exploit. Oh, by the way, when we actually do this, we're going to

385
01:12:08,619 --> 01:12:31,479
put rules in. So don't worry. This is not the Barf Drinker. This is the Puke Peddler. Oh my God.

386
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:42,010
So, yeah. Can we do a tag team? Um, it's going to be difficult. You do versus me and Josh. Yeah.

387
01:12:42,010 --> 01:13:07,899
All right. Good luck. Puke Peddler. Let's see what you got. Oh, it's this move. This is the

388
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:20,060
biggest spell. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Stinky is a very skilled player because what I'm noticing

389
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:24,779
is a lot of, uh, a lot of consumables being used. Although Puke Peddler is coming up with

390
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:31,420
the lightning here. Doesn't look good for Stinky. Stinky's in a lot of trouble. Oh, that's it.

391
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:46,569
Puke Peddler. I've got to say that was a pretty good attempt to this pretty good display.

392
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:56,149
My only issue with you is a big issue is, uh, the Barf Drinker was the pacifist and used magic

393
01:13:56,149 --> 01:14:02,359
tricks and, um, didn't like want to hurt anybody. And you just go right for the lightning move

394
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:20,840
and you're using his name. Oh, good job. I'm just kidding.

395
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,840
Everybody get out. Everybody get out. Quick. Leave. Run. Run. Run as fast as you can. Get out.

396
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,159
All dead four. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Everybody all dead four. Quick.

397
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,800
All right. How do I do it? How do I all dead four? All dead four. I'm up.

398
01:14:56,310 --> 01:15:07,180
It's like a fucking tornado coming in. It's like, it's like, did you see the tornado coming?

399
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:12,859
And it's like, whoa, look, there's a tornado coming. It's like a hundred miles away.

400
01:15:13,819 --> 01:15:27,140
Whoa, it's here. The tornado's in front of the house. Okay. That was fucking crazy. I'm so scared.

401
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:45,079
That was so scary. I don't want my computer to crash. How do I all dead four? I don't know, man.

402
01:15:45,079 --> 01:16:05,020
I'm fanicking. I don't need to back up my save. All right. So let's go back. What just happened?

403
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:15,739
Well, uh, that person that invaded may or may not have been, uh, somebody that didn't come in

404
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:23,029
and hack, uh, be a hacker. I don't know. It's so funny how everyone just like

405
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:44,970
scatters. Like everybody scatter quick. A tornado is here. Oh, that's so funny. It's like seeing

406
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:50,899
Slenderman, right? Like you're just like, oh my god, like two notes. That's cool. I got two notes.

407
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,180
And there he is. It's just like, wait, oh God, there's this thing here. I gotta get out.

408
01:17:06,119 --> 01:17:24,359
Okay. Let's, uh, so we're gonna, um, okay. So the plan here is we have to get two invasion signs.

409
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:33,939
So, uh, Josh, be an invasion sign, please put your red sign down. I'll give you a new password.

410
01:17:33,939 --> 01:17:43,270
I will check. Oh yeah. Let's go to the freezing lake. Wait, didn't I kill the boss? The freezing

411
01:17:43,270 --> 01:18:01,880
lake. I think I killed the boss here. It doesn't matter if the boss is dead with the pet. Yeah.

412
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:13,029
But how come it wasn't working before? That's kind of weird. Stay where it works. My game is offline.

413
01:18:13,029 --> 01:18:16,260
What? Hey, uh,

414
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:48,659
monkey ass. What are the 500 map markers? This game is huge. You didn't know. How did I know

415
01:18:48,659 --> 01:18:54,710
was a hacker? Uh, last time we did this, uh, he came into the game and did like a bunch of

416
01:18:54,710 --> 01:19:02,119
explosions and it was like exploding and scary. And I thought my computer was going to crash or

417
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:23,319
ran. All right. So, uh, let's make it a password to, uh, you, Josh. So let's see red signs and

418
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:41,350
gold signs, please. No, not Jesus. That was, that was a different person. What's a good,

419
01:19:41,350 --> 01:20:08,340
let me think of a good password. I mean, that's an easy one, right? Yeah. So I want to see red

420
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:15,380
signs if you could, when you eventually have this as your password, which you'll get it in

421
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:34,329
just a moment. I'll change it. I'll update the screen to red. We need red and gold from chat.

422
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:46,220
Yeah. All right. So the password is I can see, uh, Josh's symbol. So I can do this.

423
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:57,189
Password is chair nine is the password. And you see red signs and gold signs. If you could,

424
01:20:57,189 --> 01:21:39,609
that'd be fantastic. Chair nine. I need red and gold, please. Any red signs, any red signs.

425
01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:52,869
I need the, you already have, oh, I need to do the tongue. Right. You can't summon two reds.

426
01:21:53,430 --> 01:22:12,340
You can't. I thought you could. Oh, I have to do, I have to use the tongue first. Right.

427
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:30,420
Will I be able to see the signs on the ground or will this just let people invade?

428
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:39,739
Invasion timer is also literally zero. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. I mean,

429
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:51,689
I need to see some red signs. This one here, you peddler. Oh shit. We're literally being invaded

430
01:22:51,689 --> 01:23:03,420
again. Oh, this is bad. Oh, this is bad. This is bad. I think this is bad. I think this is bad.

431
01:23:13,109 --> 01:23:33,050
Why can't I see red anymore? So I'm going to gold. Okay. Well, this is, this is somebody else. This

432
01:23:33,050 --> 01:24:04,859
is Zed. Okay. I think we're all right. Wait, what do you mean run? Okay. Who's someone in this guy?

433
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:26,739
All right. Zed. Why this is coming. That's my favorite part. All right. Follow me.

434
01:24:26,739 --> 01:24:42,840
Host of fingers. Lasher the lame. All right. This is a double whip. All right. Back to the

435
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:56,260
fighting area. Please follow me to the fighting area. Good. Lasher the lame is over leveled.

436
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:59,140
That's why he has the thing next to his name. But yeah, but doesn't that mean he looks like

437
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:05,369
he's getting scaled down, right? It says down, right? How is he the host? Yeah. What does that

438
01:25:05,369 --> 01:25:25,500
mean? It makes no sense. All right. Good luck. Let's see what you got. Lasher. Double, uh,

439
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:39,060
what are they supposed to say? Giant crusher? Zed versus Lasher the lame. Lasher the lame is not

440
01:25:39,060 --> 01:26:14,170
flashing. Whoa. Actually was. What was I switched? That was a quick switch. Oh no.

441
01:26:15,619 --> 01:26:22,729
Zed is going to take this one. Unless, uh, Lasher does something very, very interesting right now.

442
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:57,399
All right. Oh shit. This is, this is a good fight though. I'm enjoying this. Damn. Oh,

443
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:13,020
actually got him. Nice job. That was a really close one. Very close. Yeah. Why is Josh flashing?

444
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:23,430
Okay. So you are technically a, okay. You're technically a, um, gold, right? So I need to use

445
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:40,069
the thing and then bring in a red symbol. Camera work was better before. Do better. How come you

446
01:27:40,069 --> 01:27:49,579
don't grow a mustache? I can't, dude. I can't have a mustache. It's not going to work. Okay.

447
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:59,189
So I need red signs. Put them down with that password. If you could please. I need to see

448
01:27:59,189 --> 01:28:28,340
red signs. Any red signs? Do we have a confirmation from the bar of drinker, by the way? Is there one

449
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:34,939

453
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:27,380
Don't fight yet, please. You're going to need some good old cartoon music if we could get it.

01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:59,130
What was that cartoon music? I want like cartoon music, cartoon background music.

463
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:07,880

The falling off. All right, we need a more red signs

469
01:33:33,979 --> 01:33:40,619
We have confirmation by the way just to let everybody know just to make sure everyone's aware

470
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:50,609
We have confirmation that the barf drinker is not ready, but they will message when they are

471
01:33:56,489 --> 01:34:08,140
Interesting the barf drinker. All right. I'm looking for red signs. Somebody has to take the lasher here if they could

472
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:14,869
This is pretty good display by the lasher. We need a red sign. So let's see some red signs, please

473
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:48,199
You home depot next the blasphemous barf drinker. All right, I think there's like 10,000 people

479
01:35:40,619 --> 01:35:59,659
How about just like Super Mario one? All right, where are you? You guys want to fight on the rock?

Is that a stagger nice

530
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:58,090
That's a good fight. Good fight. Very good fight. All right, John Eldering you

531
01:45:58,489 --> 01:46:16,239
I'm liking what I see so far. Who is this? I like what I see so far. All right, I have to do this twice

532
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:17,680
looking for gold signs

533
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,520
I'm gonna see if I can get one more person from here before I

534
01:46:21,159 --> 01:46:39,840
End it up. We'll reload the area. What was that? It was an explosion, right?

535
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:43,720
But yeah, you know what? Maybe I could refresh it by doing cross region

536
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:59,640
I wonder what if that will do anything well that like look refresh everything actually might I'll try it

537
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:10,699
When you load in you have a pool of summons about 20 that fills up a resets when you reload the game

538
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:29,409
Really I have to reload the whole game. I'm picking from a pool of 20 people out of like

539
01:47:30,409 --> 01:47:40,189
15,000 it's alright. It's what it's doing. This is fun. I'm gonna read we'll reload it

540
01:47:40,189 --> 01:47:48,380
I will reload the game and I'll reload the area. So it's somebody said I have to reload the actual game

541
01:47:48,819 --> 01:47:59,020
John Eldering, that was a great display. Thanks for playing. I got you written down. See if I can

542
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:00,579
Remove this

543
01:48:00,579 --> 01:48:29,140
Made me I mean to reload the area. Okay. Well, that was weird. All right, I'm gonna reload the game

544
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:35,449
We'll get another pool of like a hundred people or something. Why can't I quit the game? Why am I stuck here?

545
01:48:35,449 --> 01:49:03,060
Oh, what's happening right now? What's my even am I awake?

546
01:49:04,909 --> 01:49:10,989
He just did the okay

547
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:19,460
Whoa, that just opened a bunch of stuff up. Is it the same people though? Oh, these are different people

548
01:49:19,939 --> 01:49:32,380
These are these different people are these all different people I'm never gonna be able to get Josh

549
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:40,939
Well, I'm lagging. Why am I lagging so bad? I I'm gonna reload

550
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:48,699
I'm gonna do what that person said. They feel like that's my like actual game is lagging too, like hard lagging

551
01:49:49,899 --> 01:50:05,579
Yeah, we'll do new password

552
01:50:05,619 --> 01:50:38,380
How about alright so log back in? Okay, let's go use finger turn tongue on. All right

553
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:47,420
This should be this should work now use finger. Oh fuck. No, I need to

554
01:50:48,140 --> 01:51:01,039
Goddamnit. Oh, I just so can't summon to brain. Well, I would write a summon. All right. Well looks like you're playing use finger

555
01:51:01,819 --> 01:51:11,189
Fucking from software. I swear to god. It's like I need to like like be upside down drink milk

556
01:51:11,670 --> 01:51:19,949
Pat my head blink ten times to play fucking multiplayer. All right, let's trans German

557
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:28,060
We're gonna bring in this person to fry finger, but whole I it's come on

558
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:47,659
I'm just trying to summon people were you in the game already boomer Andy. No boom from software is boomer Andy actually

559
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:55,939
Playing multiplayer with people with mechanics from like 1994 is boomer. That's boomer Andy

560
01:51:56,180 --> 01:52:13,310
Wait, who's this? Who do I who's this?

561
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:28,680
Yes, I didn't I didn't summon this person. Uh

562
01:52:33,159 --> 01:52:41,939
Well, I didn't even get Josh in here. No, no, no, don't just run away. Don't just run away. All right you two

563
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:45,340
France German and and

564
01:52:45,579 --> 01:52:58,529
Wrangledorf go for it. You need to use the tongue very carefully. Okay, and because the tongue right? All right up to the rock

565
01:52:58,810 --> 01:53:15,359
Wait, what what's going on? What happened? We can't even keep track of who these people are. All right me strong and

566
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:33,819
Wrangledorf go for it. I was gonna watch where do they go? What is going on? Oh my god. All right

567
01:53:33,819 --> 01:53:57,789
I'm just fucking I'll be back. I can't even quit the game. I can't even set I have to go find me strong

568
01:53:58,130 --> 01:54:07,130
I don't even know where they went. They literally just ran away. I

569
01:54:08,029 --> 01:54:26,220
Don't know where you are. Okay, they all left. Well, how come I I can't I can't quit the game, huh?

570
01:54:26,539 --> 01:54:33,449
What the fuck is going on?

571
01:54:33,449 --> 01:55:16,279
Fucking please. No, I wanted you to kill me. Somebody kill me. Where's okay

572
01:55:16,279 --> 01:55:38,760
We're gonna reload is this is fucked up turn off the tongue tongue is off. Okay, dude. There's a clown behind you

573
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:43,619
All right, let me get Josh back in here

574
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:51,930
We'll do this for a little while longer. I want to play that scary game too. Let me get Josh back in

575
01:55:51,930 --> 01:56:07,300
I think if my games fucked up again. All right, I'm reloading one more time. Yeah new password. What's the scary game?

576
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:19,010
The what's it called something? It's like the coffee shop one. What day you guys do in the tournament?

577
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:41,430
I don't know if this might take a little longer than I thought closing shift. That's one. Yeah

578
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:50,260
I want to play closing shift. We do more of these fight clubs in the future. I love doing this

579
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:55,100
I just really wish there was a easier way to do this or how fun this is

580
01:56:55,140 --> 01:57:04,619
I just wish it wasn't this much of like a panty ass. All right new password. You guys can't see right good

581
01:57:04,859 --> 01:57:11,970
Okay, I got a password for Josh

582
01:57:12,649 --> 01:57:26,329
private lobbies would be good too. Yeah, so the way it would work right is

583
01:57:27,789 --> 01:57:35,420
I summon somebody and then somebody else so if I summon someone can someone else summon somebody else

584
01:57:35,579 --> 01:57:51,760
What do I have to summon everybody Josh needs to be yellow for no invasions. You have to summon everyone. Okay

585
01:57:51,859 --> 01:58:04,050
You just filtered by inscription. No, I didn't my plane closing shift today. Yes

586
01:58:05,619 --> 01:58:19,409
Immediately after this front of the church door. Okay. All right, Josh is coming in the password

587
01:58:19,409 --> 01:58:22,699
By the way is changing the password is now puke 30

588
01:58:22,899 --> 01:58:31,239
No spaces no capitals summon me then summon a red then use the tongue for one more red

589
01:58:31,239 --> 01:58:38,180
I think that's how it works. Yeah, so then the two reds will fight each other that makes sense

590
01:58:38,399 --> 01:58:56,699
Yeah, this is PC. So now I need to see some red signs

591
01:59:01,079 --> 01:59:08,550
Lowe some puke eater. Yeah, I I hopefully we can get confirmation that the barf drinker can participate

592
01:59:08,909 --> 01:59:21,039
Okay, well we got invaded by by busting by me I think they're probably a participant I would assume

593
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:34,899
Now I gotta use the taunter's tongue. There we go. Okay, so

594
01:59:37,319 --> 01:59:38,680
bonk you'lls

595
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:46,970
Let's do like I imagine just people are just invading. So can't summon red

596
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:57,670
I have to imagine if there's so many people just invading so here's the question then I got a really important question

597
01:59:58,069 --> 02:00:02,170
If me and Ludwig were to do this, would we actually be able to do this?

598
02:00:02,869 --> 02:00:04,869
Would we be able to actually summon people privately?

599
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:08,960
commander Hark

600
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:14,529
No

601
02:00:14,529 --> 02:00:22,989
Kinda probably not you would need to have some you need to summon

602
02:00:22,989 --> 02:00:29,100
Yeah, I would summon Ludwig as a cooperator like this and then summon an invader

603
02:00:29,399 --> 02:00:36,890
But then we would need to summon another invader. He's called me a bandwagon normie. Well, what did I do?

604
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:41,310
Just don't leak the password

605
02:00:43,329 --> 02:00:49,060
Secret passwords for all contestants. I think we lost somebody

606
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:58,609
God ended up without stream looking to know you started

607
02:00:58,609 --> 02:01:05,119
I think we had the issue was trying to be able to reliably find participants. I think I have a few ideas

608
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:11,920
Maybe it's easier to just kind of pull people. I think what's gonna have to happen is oh

609
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:27,819
My god, did you see that person? That person was ridiculous looking. All right. Well, it looks like you two are fighting

610
02:01:27,979 --> 02:01:38,079
Yeah, look by the way Ludwig is not doing what we're doing right now. It's just an idea that we thought would be fun

611
02:01:38,439 --> 02:01:43,729
If it won't really work logistically then whatever we interesting to think about

612
02:01:43,729 --> 02:01:55,680
All right, so come to the rock, please do not use tongue use gold for Ludwig then red and gold for combatants

613
02:01:56,079 --> 02:02:02,739
But the issue is can I even do that because I I can't summon more than so when I summon Josh

614
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:07,869
Will I still be able to get to see gold and red on the ground?

615
02:02:07,869 --> 02:02:16,220
Even if I summon another gold or another red that yes, okay. Okay. All right, that's confirmed. It's possible

616
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:19,079
All right, cool. All right, so let's go. So go to the rock

617
02:02:19,079 --> 02:02:32,989
You guys ready to do I like the spear. I've got Quinn stinks and then busting in me

618
02:02:33,630 --> 02:02:43,279
What what what weapon is that? I want to use that the weapons cool. What weapon art is that? Oh

619
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:55,159
Oh

620
02:02:55,159 --> 02:02:58,439
Oh, he went for the triple poke went for the triple poke and it won

621
02:02:59,079 --> 02:03:00,600
Good job

622
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:09,069
That was he that was amazing the tech chase

623
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:16,439
The tech chase

624
02:03:16,439 --> 02:03:25,550
Caught every role nice job busting excellent work. So if we have private passwords, then we can okay, I get it

625
02:03:25,789 --> 02:03:27,789
Yeah, all right, then we still we can do with fun

626
02:03:32,359 --> 02:03:35,800
The issue is that there's just everybody knows that we're doing this right now

627
02:03:39,550 --> 02:03:42,600
But people would know that during the stream day too, right?

628
02:03:44,479 --> 02:03:53,760
We wouldn't we run into the same problem get away from it. All right amir versus uh,

629
02:03:54,319 --> 02:03:58,699
We go busting bimmy. Let's do it. Just don't use the tongue

630
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:05,960
And only change location every time we might run into the same problem. We don't have to do a little bit of testing here

631
02:04:07,399 --> 02:04:26,350
All right. Good luck guys

632
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:28,350
Lots of moving lots of movement

633
02:04:43,149 --> 02:04:52,960
Flare I always do that. I was like go with the move. I'm always like

634
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:05,880
Very vulnerable, but still got out of it

635
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:23,199
Who won? Oh shit. That was close. Very nice job

636
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:31,199
You can play wobble dogs again. The reason why everything worked last time is because I used a group password

637
02:05:33,609 --> 02:05:35,130
Aren't we doing that right now?

638
02:05:35,130 --> 02:05:43,449
Can I change the group password to something pre-recorded on an undisclosed day? It would work without invasions

639
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:45,600
Huh?

640
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:50,909
And then broadcast it out

641
02:05:50,909 --> 02:05:54,439
That might work. It does. Yeah, the group password doesn't do a

642
02:05:55,060 --> 02:05:57,840
matchmaking

643
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:01,279
Three it would be an actual pre-recorded stream that would work

644
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,760
Yeah group password is only for I believe

645
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:08,810
What let me see. Well, you look cool. Hold on

646
02:06:09,050 --> 02:06:23,130
You look really cool for dan and the bow armor. Very cool. All right, let's go for it

647
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:28,880
You too, and then after this I kind of want to just fight people

648
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:33,600
I'm I like I want to get in there. I mentioned to play

649
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,920
I'll do like five or ten times and then we'll do the scary game

650
02:06:47,899 --> 02:06:58,520
Good luck. I definitely think I know at least one or two competitors from this stream

651
02:06:59,739 --> 02:07:01,739
And the barf drinker, of course, obviously

652
02:07:08,359 --> 02:07:10,750
What we might need to do

653
02:07:10,750 --> 02:07:12,989
Is we might need to hold some of these offline

654
02:07:14,029 --> 02:07:17,630
Not on stream. I think that would be interesting

655
02:07:18,569 --> 02:07:22,729
Have like a night where whoever wants to participate we kind of just have a group password and just see if we can find some

656
02:07:22,729 --> 02:07:23,770
people

657
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:29,310
Because doing it on stream is actually probably a lot harder

658
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:43,130
Yeah, i'll talk to ludwig about it. That was actually pretty plug pretty plug

659
02:07:43,930 --> 02:07:46,329
Twin blade andy over here get a load of this guy

660
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:53,850
What's wrong with twin blade andy? Very good job. Very good job

661
02:07:57,159 --> 02:07:58,199
All right

662
02:07:58,199 --> 02:08:00,199
I it's time for me to get in the ring

663
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:08,109
Yeah, there's a there's a lot of people actively doing it. This is a good this is a good trial run though

664
02:08:09,180 --> 02:08:11,979
Because I really do think that if we just have a group password in the discord

665
02:08:14,090 --> 02:08:19,689
We can have some people kind of we can have people playing i can have maybe a couple of the mods or something if they're still playing

666
02:08:20,729 --> 02:08:24,649
Keep an eye on it. See who's like doing well see who's like, you know playing against each other

667
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:27,130
Might be able to find it from from there

668
02:08:28,350 --> 02:08:33,470
There's definitely at least one or two people that i'm pulling from this stream without a doubt. I gotta take a look

669
02:08:34,109 --> 02:08:39,609
I'll talk to ludwig to see if he's uh, still interested

670
02:08:41,689 --> 02:08:46,699
I'm putting together my pvp build right now. See we already got mods ready to go. All right

671
02:08:46,699 --> 02:08:50,380
I'm putting some gear on and then i'm gonna fight and i'm gonna do some one-on-ones

672
02:08:52,859 --> 02:08:55,500
I don't think I don't know if nancy drew is gonna make it. I'm sorry guys

673
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:58,300
It was funny, but I I don't know

674
02:08:58,859 --> 02:09:07,630
What have I picked up linus?

675
02:09:07,630 --> 02:09:12,920
Yeah, if you guys want to kill each other you can while I put some stuff on

676
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:36,300
What was I wearing before the royal armory? Okay, let me put on the bastards. Didn't they buff this?

677
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:44,010
Oh my goodness

Really appreciate it. We'll pull a few people from this if we end up doing it

703
02:12:11,100 --> 02:12:13,100
It's a good experiment. I think it's worth trying

704
02:12:13,180 --> 02:12:40,350
All right. Good luck. What is josh using for a weapon? Nothing. He's gonna get killed by that

705
02:12:43,609 --> 02:12:50,060
Nice try nice job. Are you gonna end the stream without the barf drinker barf drinker was uh unavailable today?

706
02:12:50,699 --> 02:12:56,210
The barf drinker is uh was uh unavailable

707
02:12:56,829 --> 02:13:01,050
Trust me when I say the barf drinker is team captain. So if we end up doing this

708
02:13:01,689 --> 02:13:05,039
The barf drinker is the team captain no matter what it's just the way it is

709
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
And I would like to set up a stream

710
02:13:12,029 --> 02:13:14,750
Where I I just follow the barf drinker around

711
02:13:15,390 --> 02:13:20,220

719
02:15:12,189 --> 02:15:21,300

720
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:32,529
Password is still the same by the way. All right, let's go up to tarnished barf drinker might be putting down a random sign

721
02:15:32,930 --> 02:16:17,949
Uh-oh. Hello tarnished. Hi dirty rock. Ooh, didn't expect the founding reign of stars. Did you?

Ah shit ran out of stamina nice fight. Did you just rip a dab pen?

723
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:15,069
Barf drinker might be putting down a random sign really summon the barf drinker

724
02:17:15,149 --> 02:17:20,459
I mean if the team if I can see the team well, i'm not gonna call barf drinker the team captain

725
02:17:20,459 --> 02:17:25,250
That's only if they okay. I mean, yeah

726
02:17:26,129 --> 02:17:44,370
Still using baby rattle. I like it if barf drinker wants to be team captain if we do this

727
02:17:44,690 --> 02:18:03,549
You can give a password really. All right. Hold on. I'm very interested nancy to revenge. Let's go for it

728
02:18:03,790 --> 02:18:57,149

729
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:14,059
barf drinker barf drinker

730
02:19:23,649 --> 02:19:32,190
We got him. Is this the real barf drinker? Is this confirmed the real bar? I am like starstruck right now

731
02:19:37,629 --> 02:19:41,170
I want to see this guy so bad, but we have to oh, okay

02:19:41,569 --> 02:20:22,420
Is this the is this the real barf drinker? Is this him mods? It's a fake. He's a fake

733
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:37,920
He's actually a fake this is a fake wait, is it hey, is it a fake we have to see the behavior everyone just

734
02:20:38,319 --> 02:21:27,549
Everyone wait and we have to observe the behavior. I don't know if this is the real barf drinker might be real

735
02:21:28,579 --> 02:21:42,559
But did the barf drinker have a dash help him barf drinker take me wherever you want to go

736
02:21:42,799 --> 02:22:22,459
I feel like i'm observing a wild animal apparently okay

737
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:28,540
The first one had a hyphen and the second one did too. Is this the real barf drinker?

738
02:22:29,409 --> 02:22:56,770
It is the real one it is what do you want to do? Okay, what are you doing?

739
02:22:58,559 --> 02:23:08,940
This is this seems pretty barf drinker behavior, by the way, ladies and gentlemen your team captain for maybe this coming weekend

740
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:26,129
depending if we do it

741
02:23:26,930 --> 02:23:40,319
Hold on. He's trying to speed run warp technique. All right. This is the real barf drinker. I think he's trying to

742
02:23:40,799 --> 02:23:51,440
Speed run warp technique. I love this guy. All right new game plan. This is what I want. Can I uh,

02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:56,659
Josh can I see a list of the people that were I want juggles. I want barf drinker

744
02:23:58,940 --> 02:24:01,100
I want I want a list of maybe I want like four of them

745
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:04,620
I want to get a little party together and I want to go adventuring with

746
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:09,299
With the group because I need to be able to see if I can gel with these guys

747
02:24:18,239 --> 02:24:24,899
We need to go to like a dungeon together. I need to see if uh, because I have at least the three or four in mind

748
02:24:25,219 --> 02:24:32,379
Can't do that. Why not? I can do two. Yeah

749
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:34,270
All right

750
02:24:34,270 --> 02:24:38,110
We're gonna do a password for the barf drinker and for juggles the great

751
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:44,180
Those are the two that I want to do a dungeon. What dungeon have I not done on this character?

752
02:24:47,299 --> 02:24:48,819
Whatever this one is here

753
02:24:48,819 --> 02:24:57,969
You're gonna do two and you're gonna get invaded. All right, fuck it. I need a password

754
02:24:58,370 --> 02:25:05,700
We need to get a password to juggles and a password to uh barf drinker and i'm gonna do that dungeon over there

755
02:25:21,739 --> 02:25:26,860
I'm so he was trying to warp his skip. That's so funny and it was even funnier that he didn't get it

756
02:25:32,989 --> 02:25:34,430
That's the best part

757
02:25:34,430 --> 02:25:36,930
Is he was trying to get it?

758
02:25:37,250 --> 02:25:41,889
That's such fucking that is such barf drinker behavior, I love it so much

759
02:25:50,059 --> 02:25:53,579
All right, we're going down here. I'm gonna do a dungeon with these two because I want to see if I can confirm

760
02:26:04,739 --> 02:26:13,180
This is hard. Wait a minute

761
02:26:14,930 --> 02:26:16,129
Okay

762
02:26:16,129 --> 02:26:18,159
All right

763
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:21,569
Barf drinker is an actual chat. I mean

764
02:26:22,799 --> 02:26:24,559
I I agree

765
02:26:24,559 --> 02:26:32,500
All right, let's get where's the entrance to this place?

766
02:26:33,139 --> 02:26:40,750

02:26:53,629 --> 02:26:55,309
Uh, I can do two golds, right?

770
02:26:55,309 --> 02:27:19,520
It's got to be something hard. It's got to the password has to be something because nobody's going to guess right?

771
02:27:22,909 --> 02:27:47,950
It'll be kind of complicated kind of like this. Yeah, how many can what's the uh, let's see

Seven eight characters one two, three, four five six seven eight nine characters. Okay

774
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:12,299
So that's going to be the password. You can see your screen. Yeah, I know i'm gonna take care of it in a second

775
02:28:13,409 --> 02:28:16,290
So this is this is gonna be fun. I'm very excited about this

776
02:28:16,370 --> 02:28:21,569
Do you have any idea because i've been thinking about the barf drinker since we did that stream last time

777
02:28:24,030 --> 02:28:29,629
I can't wait to play with this person. I actually am starstruck right now. I'm not kidding. I truly am heavy

778
02:28:29,629 --> 02:28:38,979
I can't wait to do this

779
02:28:38,979 --> 02:28:40,979
I'm so happy we actually tracked him down to

780
02:28:42,049 --> 02:28:43,649
This guy I can't wait

781
02:28:43,649 --> 02:28:46,370
This is gonna be so much fun

782
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:58,020
This whole stream leading up to this was worth it just for this one moment. Okay you guys

783
02:28:59,979 --> 02:29:02,350
Uh

784
02:29:07,459 --> 02:29:09,950

So do I need to do I have to go down there or does it can I actually see their signs up here?

787
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:56,340
Do I have to go down first? Okay, they both have the password. Oh, yes

788
02:30:01,420 --> 02:30:05,260
Okay, put your sign down

789
02:30:05,340 --> 02:30:09,459
Should I not have done that? I am at that

790
02:30:10,299 --> 02:30:11,260

I love how barf drinker just showed up and was like i'm doing that too. What do you want to do?

804
02:32:37,389 --> 02:33:00,399
He's still warp skipping. What are you? Where is he gonna go? Is it not working?

805
02:33:01,489 --> 02:33:07,219
This scared the shit out of me. All right, we have to complete this dungeon. That is your task

870
02:46:21,889 --> 02:46:38,690
That was awesome that like and the arrows just like falling over

871
02:46:39,649 --> 02:46:52,899
Okay. All right. That was that was the one for cinema. Now. This is the one to win that was for cinema

872
02:46:55,139 --> 02:47:00,500
Oh my god. I loved every second of that. The best part of that was the barf drinker doing like the perimeter

873
02:47:00,579 --> 02:47:07,489
Just checking the perimeter juggles had no

874
02:47:08,370 --> 02:47:13,459
blast and

875
02:47:13,459 --> 02:47:23,260
Didn't get hit one time for like five straight minutes juggles carried the entire fight. Oh, man

876
02:47:23,340 --> 02:47:29,549
I love that's so funny. The best part was definitely the arrow volleys. I just thought I couldn't fucking do it anymore

877
02:47:29,549 --> 02:47:34,979
It was just too funny. All right, uh same password guys. Let's put the put these down

878
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:44,379
And barf trigger has like

879
02:47:44,379 --> 02:47:50,540
10 weapons

880
02:47:50,540 --> 02:47:57,360
I need to use the remedy. I don't want to leak the password though. Did you miss the tourney?

881
02:47:58,159 --> 02:48:00,559
Yeah, I mean I I gotta figure out what I want to do about it

882
02:48:01,440 --> 02:48:02,559
because

883
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:04,739
There's just so there's so many people

884
02:48:04,979 --> 02:48:08,350
Trying to connect that after a while

885
02:48:08,350 --> 02:48:12,510
It was just hard to kind of keep track and the invasions and tons of people trying to invade

886
02:48:13,860 --> 02:48:20,450
It's a fun experiment. It's a fun idea, but I think we might need to do it

887
02:48:21,250 --> 02:48:30,290
Offstream some too have people sign up through the discord. Yeah

888
02:48:31,010 --> 02:48:33,010
It's probably a lot more of an undertaking than

889
02:48:33,649 --> 02:48:50,829
We think what's up juggles. All right, i'm at we'll go for the win this time. Okay, i'll bring the uh you back

890
02:48:55,549 --> 02:49:08,020

02:50:26,479 --> 02:50:28,659
We may not be

902
02:50:28,659 --> 02:50:33,010
The healthiest may not be the tallest we may not be

903
02:50:33,809 --> 02:50:40,909
All right. We may not be the strongest we might not eat very well. We might have

904
02:50:42,159 --> 02:50:45,840
Uh, you know, I microwave at least three or four dinners a week at least

905
02:50:48,450 --> 02:50:50,610
Some of us may have had to go to the bathroom for the last hour
