1
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,540
Oh, I don't have it. Where's my intro video? Oh, that's right. I cleaned up. I cleaned up. Hey,

2
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,620
go back to talking to each other. Sure, hold on. Go back to talking to each other.

3
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:46,569
Shit, I think I deleted them. So, all right, I do this thing every year where I clean up my computer,

4
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,969
delete a bunch of old shit, delete a bunch of old temporary documents, and I think I deleted

5
00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:03,219
my intro videos and my outro videos. How did I do that? No, I didn't. Why would I have done that?

6
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:10,039
Because I just tried to play it and it didn't work. Hold on. Oh, shit. This is the new intro.

7
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,860
Wait, wait, wait. I'll get it. I'll get it. Where is it? No, here it is.

8
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:29,270
So, where the hell is it? Oh, all right. Why is it over here? Well, fuck it. All right. Well,

9
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:40,659
hey, guys. Today, we're going to play a game called Black and White. Black and White. It is a...

10
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,819
All right. I don't want you to... I don't want you on camera anymore. All right. Here we go.

11
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:57,270
Here's the real intro. Where the fuck is it? This is actually annoying me. Where is it? Okay. Hey,

12
00:02:57,270 --> 00:04:27,370
all right. See you in a minute. It's pre-manning and on yet. Bye. Okay. So, the plan today. Yes,

13
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:34,569
I'm not 100% recovered from being sick. I remember a few days ago, I started to get a bad migraine

14
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:40,170
and I was like, ah, fuck, I got a migraine. And then it just turned into a full blown just head

15
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:49,560
cold. I had a bad sore throat. My head was hurting. Kim now has it. So, it's not... It's just the

16
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,279
season. But I'm feeling all right now. I'm coming down from it. It's been a few days

17
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:04,089
and my head is not as hurting as much. So, I can spring. Good to go. With that, we're going to play,

18
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,449
like I said, Black and White. You've never heard of Black and White before. You're probably like,

19
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,370
wait a minute. And if you have heard of Black and White, you just... You just pog to your pants

20
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:19,339
right now. You shit your pants. Because this is... This is one of the most classic old

21
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,459
God simulating games that existed. Everybody that had a PC back 10, 15 years ago loved this game.

22
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:34,740
It's a lion head game. It's old lion head. The problem is they never ported it anywhere. They

23
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,779
never did anything with this. This series is just lost forever, apparently. They made a second one.

24
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:48,920
But it's just one of those games that everybody's just... Where's the third one? Give us a new

25
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:58,089
Black and White, please. It's one of those games. So, without further ado, welcome back, everybody.

26
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,420
I cannot promise you a, like, 12-hour spring today, but I can promise you a 10.

27
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:10,699
Let's go. Black and White. Why did I just... No, why did I just say that?

28
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,100
I'm not doing a 10-hour spring. This is probably going to be, like,

29
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,620
five. I got a headache. Okay, I got a headache. I got a headache. I got a headache. I'm doing it,

30
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:31,240
and I'm not doing that. Liar. Liar. Here we go. Black and White on an HD screen. That's right.

31
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:40,629
Wait, hold on. I gotta do this first. All right. You get one... You get... You get one more second.

32
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:53,220
Make it count, because you never... This is never happening ever again. Okay. Somebody

33
00:06:53,220 --> 00:07:02,550
Pogged their fans already. Pog... Oh, that's so stupid. All right. Here we go. Black and White.

34
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:11,560
Open it. Uh-oh. Did it just insta-crash? Wait. I tested this, like, a thousand times. I tested

35
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,639
this a thousand times. This should not have insta-crashed. Okay. I tested this a thousand

36
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:28,170
times. It insta-crashed. Hold on. Okay. Jesus, man. Gonna give me a fucking heart attack.

37
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:43,319
I was gonna say, no way. Black and White, ladies and gentlemen. Lionhead Studios. Peter Molyneux.

38
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:56,149
The greatest video game developer to have ever fucking lived. In his own words.

39
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:02,279
Please choose from one of the following options. Start the game normally. Skip straight to the

40
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,519
creature select. Skip all of the creature to keep your... All right. I did open... I'm gonna...

41
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:13,430
I'm gonna be completely transparent here. I did open this, because I wanted to make sure I could

42
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:22,279
get it captured and in full HD texture. Uh, what's gonna start the game normally? You ready? What

43
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:28,839
the fuck is this game? You'll see. Is it gonna be a smash hit? I knew it. I knew it when I... I knew

44
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,090
it. It's gonna be a smash hit. Remember your favorite stream of, like, the last 10 years?

45
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,289
Add this one. Smash hit. Here we go.

46
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,389
Jinxed it. I'm just kidding. Am I though?

47
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:17,659
Don't go in the water! Wait, why? Why can't... Oh, because there's sharks.

48
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:33,929
I'll handle this.

49
00:09:37,370 --> 00:10:00,279
That kid was fast. So those of you that wanted me to play Godhand, this is close enough, I think,

50
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:26,950
right? This does two birds with one stone. I read this script already. Yeah, we talked... We did...

51
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:33,620
Pre-stream gets a couple of jokes that happen on stream, all right? And somebody said, hey,

52
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:39,379
I saw that joke four hours ago in pre-stream. Yeah, it's fucking easy joke to make. Everybody

53
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,779
wants me to play Godhand. I'm playing a game where you play a literal hand of a god.

54
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:47,220
It's the easiest comedy ever. This kid just got hit by a fucking meteor.

55
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:04,009
Thank you, God. I did.

56
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:10,970
Thank you. Thank you for your mercy. We praise you. I require

57
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:18,419
all three of you to do a Fortnite dance. There it is. Okay, good. Good. I like that one. That's

58
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:28,519
the one where you go up and down with your hand. Good one. Greetings. We're your conscience. Good

59
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:36,039
and evil. Chaotic evil. Black and white. As part of you, we'll guide you through this world.

60
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:48,120
Chaotic evil. Okay. Good and evil. Should I be good or should I be evil? What do you think?

61
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:57,769
Our people will want to worship you. Please come with us to our village. Be evil? Why would I be

62
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:07,399
evil? I'll show you how to follow them. How to move. Let's see. You move your hand in the direction

63
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:14,039
you want to travel like this. Then you click and hold the move button. After that, you move the

64
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:20,600
mouse towards you to drag forwards. You grab the ground and drag backwards. You click, hold, and

65
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,710
pull again to cover more grounds. Sorry. Yeah, you actually have to grab the hand and move.

66
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:36,409
He's got sticky keys on. No, I don't. Follow your new worshipers to the village.

67
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:39,850
You'll have to grab the landscape several times. All right, let's go see their village.

68
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,539
I actually love this game and its sequel. Me too. All right, here we go.

69
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:54,970
This, this, you don't think this is going to be scary? What's the thing from Adam's family?

70
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:02,899
Cousin It? This thing's just running next to you? Not cousin it. What's it called? Not lurch.

71
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:08,179
Lurch is the tall guy. Thing. I'm right, I'm literally just right next to you.

72
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:20,470
The thing, thing, yes, thing. I'm right. I'm literally in my field of view.

73
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:25,720
How far away is your village? What were you guys doing out here?

74
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:33,000
I was foretold. The prophecy has come true. We can now finish the temple.

75
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:44,330
Let's go. Let's move to the temple by clicking and dragging or double click the move button

76
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:49,210
on it to go straight there. Same guy. All right, let's move to the temple clicking and dragging

77
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:57,559
or double click the move button to go straight there. Ooh, the move button. Temple. There it is.

78
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,399
We're, I think we're almost at the most important part of the entire game and that is

79
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,720
who do I want to be? Hey, it's not finished. Who do I want? And you'll, what's he, what's he

80
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,960
talking about? What do you mean? We're talking, you'll see. This temple will be the focus of our

81
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:24,539
power. Okay, good. But now it's time to learn how to look around. I'm going to do a poll.

82
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:29,740
Yeah, we'll do a poll. You move the hand to the side of the screen until the rotate

83
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,179
arrow appears like this. You hold down the move button. Then you move. I can't wait

84
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:39,500
to play this. Rotate around and see things from a different angle.

85
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,820
Certainly circular motion. Hold down the move. You can rotate either way.

86
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,450
Do a smart click instead. I actually, my smart clicks are broken.

87
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:53,049
They're all fucked up. You can also use the keyboard to rotate.

88
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:01,340
Okay, yeah. Now you try looking around. Just dragging around. You can go like this. You can

89
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:08,580
go like this. Not middle mouse. What was it? Not right mouse. What was it? I wasn't paying

90
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:16,950
attention. Shift. There it is. Wait, what? Is it not shift? Shift what?

91
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:27,860
Yeah, I was, oh, edge of the screen, right? Edge of the screen. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's right.

92
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,929
Okay, cool. Good. Now let's learn how to- How do you look up and down?

93
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:42,409
You move your hand to the top or bottom edge of the screen until the pitch arrow appears.

94
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:45,129
You hold down the move button. I don't want to have to do that. What's the key? Then you

95
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:49,129
move the hand to look up and down. You can do this with the middle mouse button.

96
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,179
You can do all this with the middle mouse button. I don't even need to know this.

97
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:58,409
But we have to do this tutorial. You can also use the keyboard to pitch.

98
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:06,570
Now you have a go. Yeah, middle mouse button's gonna do this. Splendid. That's it. That's it.

99
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:14,490
You've got the idea. But I know that doing tutorials, it's just a thing. If I just blow

100
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:21,450
through it, I don't care. Oh, now time to play and I don't fucking know what I'm doing.

101
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,169
You move the mouse towards you to zoom out. You know what I mean? Like that. It's gonna make

102
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:32,840
people angry. And you move the mouse away from you to zoom in. Zooming, as you see, is extremely

103
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:39,399
useful. You can also use the keyboard to zoom. Now you try. Yeah, I know how to do this. I know.

104
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:46,200
Yeah. And see, I told you, I didn't even need to do that. That's it. You've done it. All this moving

105
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,440
around is giving me a headache. I think we may need to practice a bit. We can go to the God's

106
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,639
playground by pressing F2 on the keyboard at any time. Wait, what? Now we've learned how to

107
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:08,500
move and look. We can help the villagers build the temple. I saw somebody resident sleeper over

108
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:16,259
there. I want you to remember that resident sleeper in 20 minutes. I want you to remember

109
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:23,220
that. I want you to wake up and go, what the fuck have I written? In 20 minutes, I want you to

110
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,980
remember what you've written. I want you to look at it. I want you to look at the screen and go,

111
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:33,319
I wrote that 20 minutes ago. All right, let's take some food and wood from the store to the

112
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:39,240
builders. First, you move the hand over the food or wood like this. You feed villagers by pressing

113
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,319
the action button. The longer you hold, the more you pick up. You can still drag while holding

114
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:53,940
objects. See, I helped. I'm just a big hand. You press the action button while holding an object

115
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:09,819
to drop it. All right, here we go. So let's get some wood. How much wood do we need? How much wood

116
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:14,140
do they have? All right, I'm taking all of them. I sure don't need to take this much. All right,

117
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:28,490
I don't need to take this much. Okay, I have 5,000. How much does it need? All right, I got it.

118
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:44,329
Wood required zero. Very good. He's the wood god. See, look at him. And it's got great music too.

119
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:49,369
I'm not picking him up yet. You guys, this is, this is, if I pick up somebody and like

120
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,569
yeet him into the ocean, I'm going to get negative god points. You want me to be good, not evil.

121
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:21,049
All right, do I need more wood? Yeet the non-believers. Oops. Oh, no, there we go.

122
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:32,789
I don't know. It just takes time. It just takes time. There we go. What happened? Oh, they said,

123
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:42,410
wow. There it is. They're trying to best straw poll for good or evil. No, I'm going to decide

124
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:57,259
there's no good. There is no good and there is no evil. This game's called black and white. I know.

125
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:06,259
But sometimes good people do evil things. Sometimes evil people do good things.

126
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:13,140
This is the entrance. Click the action button on it to take you inside.

127
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:24,410
Ray. All right, let's go inside the temple. Incredible. The tribe built all this.

128
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:29,529
No good or evil. Only checks. And to think it's a monument to you as a god.

129
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,980
And us as your conscience, don't forget. The workmanship is amazing.

130
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:42,460
And what a symbol of overwhelming evil. Death's in your region. Birth's in your region. No, it isn't.

131
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:48,819
Sacrifices. This here must be a map of the homeland. What about all these doors?

132
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:56,490
Each leads to a room. The rooms are extremely useful. Let's try some.

133
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:03,269
Okay, let me take a look at this. Check out all the writing on the scroll, boss.

134
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:07,269
Percentage that believe in you. It's showing lots of information about your followers and

135
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:13,140
your villages. Unbelievable. Only 59 people live here. Yeah, look at this.

136
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:18,099
Death's in your region. Births. Number of sacrifices. Buildings. Wonders in your region.

137
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,259
Disciples in your realm. Builders. Breeders. Fishermen. Farmers. Foresters. Missionaries.

138
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:32,650
Craftsmen. Traders. Well, let's see. All right, that's cool. Let's take a look at the other rooms.

139
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:43,589
This is the save game room. Okay. Here's the library, which I don't think is gonna happen.

140
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:50,170
This is the library. The scrolls contain a whole bunch of useful information.

141
00:21:54,039 --> 00:22:00,039
Village help. Help with village life. Yeah, this is just extra documentation.

142
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:08,200
You know, it's just documentation. What does it say? Story history. The evil conscience said the

143
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,200
scrolls contain a whole bunch of useful information. One line ago the good conscience said this is the

144
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,039
library. Two lines ago the good conscience said... Am I playing? Is this AI dungeon?

145
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:30,259
This is a transcript of what everybody has said. It's a lore scroll.

146
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,259
All right, what else is in here? I don't remember. Challenge room. I think there's a creature cave.

147
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:45,940
Game options. I don't want to touch that. The future room. What is the... Okay, the creature cave.

148
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,900
Oh, this is an expansion thing, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Yeah, this is like an expansion room.

149
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,009
What does the challenge room do? This game has like two expansions.

150
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,130
You can get information on each challenge. Also, if a challenge is unfinished,

151
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,130
press the button underneath them. All right, so this is challenge room. Let's take a look.

152
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:21,690
I'm just trying to get the info. There are no challenges right now. It's just a bunch of empty

153
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:33,529
frames. All right, it's time. It's time for the most important thing of the whole day,

154
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:40,359
because this does not change, by the way. I think we have to figure out what each one does.

155
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:48,250
Daza, thank you. Daza for the 10 community subs. 10 subs from Daza. Whoa. Thank you.

156
00:23:48,250 --> 00:24:10,579
The future is uncertain. Yeah. So what? More DLC. Yeah, I know. Don't save. I'm not going to save.

157
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:17,940
I've read... I've got all the patches that I need. The game can only be saved when it autosaves.

158
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:37,380
Yeah, I will actually break it. All right. Who do I want? Who do I want to be?

159
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:44,180
It's tough. It's a hard choice. Let's explore. I'm dying to know what these signposts are.

160
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:52,259
No, not yet. Not yet. Not yet. We need to learn. No, there's so much we got to do. I say we hunt

161
00:24:52,259 --> 00:25:00,630
out the gold story scrolls. He just wants to go. He wants to skip. This is

162
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:10,680
you. The devil is you guys right now. Oh, let's learn more about the world. No. With Nancy Drew.

163
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:21,779
A gold story scroll looks like this. Clicking on gold story scrolls with the action button

164
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:26,019
will lead you through your quest in Eden. That's right. You can activate the scroll

165
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:33,900
or you can explore. It's up to you, leader. Okay. I'm going to do the right thing.

166
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,640
You know, I'm going to do the right thing and that's I'm going to make sure that I know what's

167
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:46,440
going on. I get a lot of shit for this. I get a lot of shit for this. So I'm not going to go.

168
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,480
What's the lumber mill do? What's this? What's this do? What's that do? What's the tent do?

169
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,440
No, I'm going to be good and I'm going to learn. You can scroll through some of these info signs

170
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,240
to read all the text. Hold the action button. No, no one's dying yet. Any information you

171
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:12,680
read on one of these is added to the library in the temple. No one is dying yet. I'm not going to

172
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,640
have bad points or good points yet. I just want to, I just want to remember how to play the video

173
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:25,990
game. The village quiet. Somebody shot a gun. Okay. You didn't think there were guns in this game?

174
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:34,650
I think I just saw a bunch of people pog instead of another fire. All right, mute the chat. Mute

175
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:48,150
the chat. I don't want to look over there right now. Centrist Gray NPC Jeremy. That's the last

176
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,509
thing that I read and that's the last thing I'm going to read for the next like 10 minutes.

177
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:03,160
Store contains wood and food. You can add either resource to the store. Right. I can,

178
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:07,859
I'm still looking over there. You guys are in my head. The villagers will also gather them

179
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,819
unless they are worshiping. Right. Okay. So this is the store. You can store wood. You can store

180
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:17,380
food. It's grain. You can add either resource. The villagers will also gather them unless they

181
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:23,539
are worshiping or they are assigned as a disciple to another task. Right. Surrounding flags indicate

182
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:29,380
the level of need. The higher the flag is raised, the greater the need of your villages. Place your

183
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,019
hand over the red of, why did I say red flags? To gain more information about it. Okay. Yeah. So

184
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:40,980
here we go. So children desire is what? Food desire. What does, that means they want to have

185
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:48,549
children. Well, go for it. What's, how's that stopping me? No, don't put it in emote only.

186
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:53,589
Emote only makes it easier for them to be mean to this classic. I can't even believe it.

187
00:27:54,549 --> 00:28:04,730
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Imagine resident sleeper ring like Half-Life. Imagine. Just imagine. Like

188
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:12,170
resident sleeper ring. Half-Life. Because that's what you're doing right now. This is one of the

189
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:22,779
most classic fucking top 10 PC games ever existed. I mean, it might be like number nine and Half-Life

190
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:33,539
might be like number two. Right. Or whatever. But like, you know, come on. Disable the chat. No,

191
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:40,299
I'm moving on. I don't even, whatever. They'll, they'll see. They'll just let, let them resident

192
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:45,740
sleeper for the next fucking 40 minutes. They'll see. They'll see when the first boulder rolls

193
00:28:45,740 --> 00:29:04,059
through the town. They'll see. They're doing it for the jokes. I know. So am I. Backtrack and bury.

194
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:09,740
Did you know you can hold the action button to draw, to drown, to down, to pick up increasing

195
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,140
amounts of food. Yep. You can also drop trees and wooden objects into those stores as well

196
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:21,940
as food from the fields or fish from the sea. Yes. So you can just drop food in here. I got it. Okay.

197
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:29,269
Relax. Did you know that signposts always contain useful information about the world? Once you've

198
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:34,630
read them, their knowledge will appear in the library inside your temple. Yes. You can scroll

199
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:42,680
through some of the info signs to read all the text using the action button. Oh, that's cool.

200
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,599
That's right. All right. If I didn't, imagine if I didn't know that. Imagine resident sleeper ring

201
00:29:46,599 --> 00:30:03,049
half-life. Did you know you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out? Yes, I know. Oh my God.

202
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:30,970
You can use them. Yes, I know that. Yep. Okay. All right. We're good.

203
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:41,700
I love this game and I'm going to play it. That's all that needs to be said. So. All right. No,

204
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,220
don't give it to them. Don't give it to them. Don't give them. Don't just pick somebody up

205
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,059
and whip them into the ground. Don't do that. That's what they want. That's what they want

206
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:54,710
you to do. And I'm not doing it. You could press the following key to show you the name. Oh,

207
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:04,009
that's cool. And make tracking their movements easier. That's actually really, really good.

208
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:22,759
Interesting. N. That didn't work. N? Yeah. N, right? No, I can't. It doesn't work.

209
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,920
If you see a house with smoke coming out of it, it is occupied. Okay. To eject the occupants,

210
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:40,900
tap the house. Oh, did I just do that? Oh no, there's nobody living here. Let's try somebody.

211
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,259
People are in the house and green people would show free spaces. All right. Well, get out.

212
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:59,849
Get out. I think it's the tutorial. That's why I can't do it. Oh, that's cool. All right. Read

213
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:05,670
this one. Placing a man or woman next to someone of the opposite sex turns them into a disciple

214
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:27,930
breeder whose only goal is to breed and produce children. Drop. Disciple breeder.

215
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:40,519
So we have breeder. Okay. We got breeders. Somebody. I keep hearing like a sniper rifle

216
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,990
in the distance. It's like freaking me out. You can plant forest by picking up a tree and placing

217
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,390
it upright in the ground. That's cool. If you place a tree in a village, it becomes a scenic

218
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,789
addition and will please your people. Foresters will not cut these trees down. All right. That's

219
00:32:54,789 --> 00:33:04,339
good to know. We're almost there. We're almost there. Every time you activate a gold story

220
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:09,190
scroll, you start the next chapter. Okay. All right. Let's. Okay. Here we go.

221
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:18,890
I just, I wanted to get that info. Greetings, Holy one. You've activated a gold story scroll.

222
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:24,569
I have. My name is Sable. I am a trainer of creatures. I challenge you to open these gates.

223
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:33,420
Creatures. Behind them are three wondrous creatures. That's right. Every god has a creature.

224
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,220
Every god has a creature. Tall as a mountain and can perform miracles. But you can't open

225
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,819
the gate unless you find the three gate stones. Each stone you find must be placed on this platform.

226
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:53,420
I'll get them. Throw her into the ocean. No. The villagers were dancing around a gate stone

227
00:33:53,420 --> 00:34:01,930
when you arrived. No. Once you place this gate stone on the platform, I will tell you of the

228
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:13,449
other two. Throw the ocean into her. Now retrieve the first gate stone, Holy one. Okay. Let's go

229
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:20,570
get the gate stone. It was over, where was it over here? Right. It was like on the beach.

230
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:36,570
Who lives here? Where was it? Wasn't it like when I first got here? It was like right here, right?

231
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:41,769
Yeah, it's right here. Here's the stone that people were dancing around. Pick it up by

232
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:48,489
clicking the action button on it and drop it on someone's house to please all the people

233
00:34:48,489 --> 00:35:14,409
resident sleepering half-life one. Get it? Drop it on her. Excellent. You found a gate stone.

234
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:19,130
You'll need to search for another now. Try looking for a gold story scroll in the village.

235
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:31,980
I'll find it. Easy. Oh, that's not a scroll. That's a moon. All right, looking for a gold scroll.

236
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:53,800
Anybody see a gold scroll here? What's going on here? Oh, Holy one. I kneel before you.

237
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:03,000
Nerd neck. My brother suffering a fever has left his sick bed and become lost.

238
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:11,960
All right, we're gonna find the lost. He's so weak. I'm frightened he'll die.

239
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,039
If you find him and bring him home, I'll give you one of the three gate stones.

240
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:30,659
It's in my house. Kill him. Hey, I got a plan. Why don't we trash the house?

241
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:36,099
We can get the gate stone that way. I heartily object. That's just malicious.

242
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:38,019
What do we do? That's kind of the whole point.

243
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,179
The lost brother is in some trees through the pass.

244
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:59,000
What's in the house? What's in the house, lady? Any gold in here?

245
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:06,789
Fields are where you people plant crops, which are then harvested and carried to the store.

246
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,309
Yes, to add to the food pile, you can harvest crops yourself.

247
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:16,230
As can your creature. You can also make dedicated farmer disciples by placing villagers in these

248
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:27,219
fields. Trash the house. No, if I'm God right now, I go find the lost brother is in some trees

249
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:36,659
through the pass. I didn't see this skipper out. Well, there goes the skipping God hand

250
00:37:38,679 --> 00:38:05,909
on his way. Where is he? No, I can't let them. I can't let them dictate what I'm going to do

251
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:26,440
as my as me. I'm bringing them back. There you are. I've been so worried. Do as we command.

252
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:42,039
Thank you for your benevolence. Do you want me to go against the title of my own damn stream?

253
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:56,409
Now steal. All right. You want me to drop this on somebody and watch them explode?

254
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:58,650
Is that what you want? Is that what you seriously want me to do?

255
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:12,139
Yes. And everyone calls me the psycho. Holy shit. You're a psycho. I crushed that guy.

256
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,659
Good. You have two of the gate stones, but the third could be a problem.

257
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:23,940
The villagers say the final one was destroyed eons ago. All is not lost though. The village

258
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,900
sculptor can carve a new gate stone for you. You should see him. All right. Village sculptor.

259
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:39,769
What do you got? That's not big enough. It's gotta be way bigger. Holy one. I hear you're looking for

260
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:46,809
a gate stone. I am a sculptor. Burn the gate down. If you provide me with the right rock,

261
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:54,969
I'll carve one for you. Okay. You'll find the rock I need in the old hermit's quarry. Please

262
00:39:54,969 --> 00:40:03,719
bring it to you. Smash. I can't. I'm not going to smash and kill people in the tutorial.

263
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:13,820
All right. There it is. Go get the big rock. I'm definitely the best sculptor in the village.

264
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:25,699
That's why you can't die. You want me to kill the best sculptor in the village? What? Why would I

265
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:31,940
do that? Oh, pick up rock and throw rock into people. Okay. Yeah. That's fun. There's no going

266
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:47,300
back if I do that. You understand? All right. Where was it over here? Where was it? Right here?

267
00:40:47,300 --> 00:41:01,670
I thought it was right over here. Wasn't it right there? Over here? Where's this rock?

268
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:08,309
Where is it? I can't even go this way. The old hermit's quarry. Yeah. Well, wasn't that like

269
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:31,400
right here? That's not, I thought it was right here. Um, which, which one? Does it matter?

270
00:41:44,219 --> 00:42:00,570
Is this, I can't pick this up. This can't be moved. Um, is this what? No, I need to be bigger than

271
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:15,800
that. How do I, I can't move these. Maybe does it matter here? Use this one. I guess this is big

272
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:28,329
enough here. Right. That's big enough. Actually, this rock isn't right for the fucking serious.

273
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:41,400
Why? No, no, no. Oh shit. No, no, no, no cat. I want to pick them up. Now. Now you believe,

274
00:42:41,400 --> 00:43:03,590
huh? Now you all start to believe, you know, I didn't believe in that God until he bowling balled

275
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:09,769
that rock down the flip. All right. So why can't I pick up? Like I don't, I want to pick it up.

276
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:25,300
Am I, am I insane or is it like this one? Yeah. It's this one, right? No. Keep going.

277
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:46,659
Nothing else here. It's up the hill. Left, left, left up here. Here's the stone you need.

278
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:57,179
Found it. If you press F1, when your hand is over something information on it will be displayed.

279
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:09,079
All right. Let's see. Gate stone. I actually have to be careful. I don't want to kill anybody

280
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:20,619
accidentally. All right. Let's do this. Here you go. Here's the stone you need. Yeah, I know. I

281
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:25,019
just put it down. That's excellent. Exactly the right kind of rock to work with. Dude, Half Life 1.

282
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:27,340
Thank you. Come back later and I'll have it finished.

283
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:36,550
Come back later. How, how, how much later? The sculptor is still carving the gate stone.

284
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:46,539
What am I supposed to do in the meantime? We should speak to the sculptor about the gate stone.

285
00:44:46,539 --> 00:45:00,119
Hurry up. I don't got all day. I don't have time for this. Oops. Go back to work. Breed with,

286
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:07,190
all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's breed. Oh, this person's already breeding. How much breeding?

287
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:16,380
I say some are jigging about on here. What? This village is just chilling. All right. Hold on.

288
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,619
People are just having sex with each other and stuff. What is going on?

289
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:32,739
This village is just chilling. Hold on. Wait, what? That lady, that lady was already pregnant.

290
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:52,469
All right. Let's go. The gate stones are together. Pass through and claim your creature. That's the

291
00:45:52,789 --> 00:46:01,699
Oh, because that's a resident breeder. What? So hold on. Did I, did I designate that person

292
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:23,480
to be just a breeder? Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

293
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:30,809
Here we go. There they are. There they are. You see them? Look at the corner. Do you see?

294
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:36,250
I don't see them. I don't see what you're talking about. Oh, I see them.

295
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:53,139
Yeah. Look at them. Just look at them. These are miraculous creatures indeed. They certainly are,

296
00:46:53,139 --> 00:47:01,059
but not quite as big as I expected. Not yet, maybe, but they can become powerful creatures

297
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:08,019
in the world. Now that I'd like to see, we must have one. What should we choose? They're all

298
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:15,539
special. That makes me like the monkey hearing that like, like that makes me like the monkey,

299
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:21,059
but all that we do have nerd neck tiger. You know what I mean? Like this, this is a hard choice.

300
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:29,690
There's nerd neck tiger, there's funny monkey, and then there's just absolutely just, just,

301
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:40,440
what do you, I don't even know what you call it. Superhero cow. Good luck. You have to pick.

302
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:51,769
It's not going to be up to me. They, they all have their own personalities, by the way.

303
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:15,909
Monkey, tiger make, this is a really important choice. Okay. Let's see what you guys do.

304
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:24,789
I'll get you. I'm going to put them on the screen in full HD so you can see what they all do.

305
00:48:37,429 --> 00:48:41,670
Oh, come on. You don't look at it. Did you just superhero cow just did a split for you?

306
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:49,099
That was very impressive. Whoa, boy. And the superhero cow, unfortunately is going to lose.

307
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:54,579
Oh, that's unfortunate. That's unfortunate. I just,

308
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,389
monkey is going to win. I can't believe it.

309
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,670
The cow just did a fucking split.

310
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:15,190
You have to veto. I have to veto. I have to veto.

311
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:36,360
Oh, what was that? I like, like you now. Okay. Cat. I like the tiger now.

312
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:47,380
I want the cow. I want the cow. I don't care. No democracy today.

313
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:51,380
Are you sure you want this creature? Click on him again if you are.

314
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,369
Oh, but he just laughed at me.

315
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,449
How about the ape? Intelligent and quick to learn.

316
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:05,610
This is, I can't change this. Oh, it just did no split.

317
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:12,619
Chosen a creature.

318
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:31,269
He was surprised. The cow was surprised by this, by this. He's like, holy shit, it actually worked.

319
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:44,219
You're a dictator. This is your creature's new home.

320
00:50:45,659 --> 00:50:50,360
He's small at the moment, but look after him and one day he'll be big and powerful.

321
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:59,590
He isn't comfortable in his new home yet. In fact, he's a little frightened.

322
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:05,690
You can stroke him to reassure him.

323
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,369
Let's, let's pet, let's pet cow. Can you pet cow? Yes.

324
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:17,050
Click and hold the action button, then move your hand to stroke him by holding the action

325
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:22,409
button and moving your hand over him gently. Stroking tells him you're approving and it makes

326
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:28,090
him happy. Okay, scratch his belly.

327
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:35,699
So I'm not trying to do that. I'm going really slow.

328
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:58,199
All right, good boy. See how he likes that? He feels much better now.

329
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:04,119
Okay. I'll leave you two alone for a while. I'll return later to teach you more.

330
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:16,070
He's going to pog. Did he pog? Where are you going? One percent damage.

331
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:20,679
Fuck. All right. Let's see. This is your creature's home.

332
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,000
It feels, he feels safe here and when he rests, he'll grow in size faster. That's right. They get

333
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,320
fucking huge. You can place interesting things in the pen for your creature and inside the temple

334
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:40,460
is a creature's cave full of useful statistics about him. Look at that. Look at that side eye.

335
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,139
Yeah. Okay. So we can get him toys and stuff. What else can I do?

336
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:53,579
Space bar is a shortcut key to place your camera. Get out of here. The space bar is a shortcut key

337
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:59,500
to place your camera in a safe position. Press it again to return you to the temple. Pressing it

338
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:06,820
again will return you to original. All right. So if I go like, I see. Okay. So you can just like,

339
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:19,000
you can have it focused and shit safe, I guess. I see. What do you want? Is he laughing?

340
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:28,599
Oh no, he's going, hey, over there. Hey you, go over there. Oh, I love him.

341
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:39,639
His voice is kind of annoying. Your creature is getting hungry. Let's eat.

342
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:48,500
I suggest you find him something to eat. Choose carefully though. Some things are better for him

343
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:57,159
than others. They eat people. All right. We're going to find food. What do you, what do you like

344
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:06,889
to eat? Hunger. 100% tiredness. All right. Hungry. What do we eat? If you want a creature to eat

345
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:11,130
something, rub his tummy when you give it to him. He'll eat it even if he's not hungry.

346
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:21,940
Hungry. Okay. Um, does he eat people? I don't know if you should eat people.

347
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,539
There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge...

348
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:30,489
Does he eat wood? Oh, there's a, wait, there's a reward scroll.

349
00:54:30,489 --> 00:54:33,929
Oh look, a silver reward scroll. Let's see what it...

350
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,969
Okay, let's get our projectile skills up the scratch.

351
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:42,650
What do you suggest? I presume it involves killing.

352
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:49,130
No, not at all. I was going to propose, uh, we, uh, I know...

353
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:50,889
I'm gonna feed him. Let's see if we can hit that

354
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:56,409
pillar over there. It's a test of our godly powers and nobody gets hurt.

355
00:54:56,409 --> 00:55:01,449
How nice. And I guess we use this everlasting pile of stones.

356
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:06,119
Hmm, handy that. Move your hand over a rock.

357
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:07,800
Yeah, all right. This is teaching how to throw.

358
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,079
Press the action button until the rock is in your hand.

359
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,960
And we're gonna knock down the rock. Hold down the action button.

360
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,559
Put momentum on the throw by moving the hand in the correct direction.

361
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:20,519
So you can actually...

362
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:22,599
Throw the rock by releasing the action button.

363
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:24,760
Yeah. Try throwing a rock now.

364
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:33,510
There we go. Okay, I need a little bit more.

365
00:55:34,389 --> 00:55:35,670
Not enough weight behind that one.

366
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:41,989
Now that was close.

367
00:55:41,989 --> 00:56:36,539
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go back to work. Okay.

368
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,559
I will feed the cow. Just wait.

369
00:56:56,969 --> 00:56:59,849
That hit. Wait, I have to hit the top thing off?

370
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:00,969
Oh my god, this is gonna be...

371
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:02,969
You're doing well, but you have...

372
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:08,869
I know. Holy shit, that was too fast.

373
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:25,300
Oh my god, this is hard.

374
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:39,179
Here we go. All right.

375
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,300
The cow's starving. The cow's gonna be fine.

376
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,039
We've been given a chest.

377
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:59,079
Oh, it's a toy. It's a toy for the cow.

378
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,519
Awesome. All right. Okay. Look what I got.

379
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:05,639
I know you're hungry, but look.

380
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:11,269
Where are you? There you are.

381
00:58:11,269 --> 00:58:13,510
Give your food by putting your hand in front of him

382
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,269
and then holding the action button.

383
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:16,949
Look at this.

384
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,699
Hey, you.

385
00:58:25,659 --> 00:58:31,219
Where are you going? All right. You.

386
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:32,420
I know. I know. I know.

387
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,619
I know you're pointing at me. Eat.

388
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:35,380
All right. I need food.

389
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:46,780
What is this? What is this?

390
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,340
This is a... I don't know what this is.

391
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:53,579
There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.

392
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,460
He seemed to like that.

393
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,739
Try feeding him some more. I'll be back later.

394
00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:13,780
Oh, no. Now he is insufferable. Just lust for food.

395
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:22,710
Here. Play with this. See? He's like, oh.

396
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,739
Hey, good job. Here.

397
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:34,340
Yes. What about? What do you want?

398
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:38,539
You strong? How are you doing? You're okay.

399
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,539
Good boy.

400
00:59:44,139 --> 00:59:47,159
I was rubbing his tummy. I was rubbing his...

401
00:59:48,949 --> 00:59:51,190
I was rubbing his tummy. It said rub tummy.

402
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:56,230
It said rub tummy for food stuff.

403
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:02,500
All right. Let's go.

404
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:09,349
All right. Where's the silver scroll?

405
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:17,639
Silver reward scroll. Where was it?

406
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,019
I don't remember where it was.

407
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:34,219
Oh, fuck. Who's this motherfucker?

408
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:39,739
Oh, no. It's a rival god.

409
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:43,340
It's spying on my base.

410
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,699
All right. He's spying on my base.

411
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:54,150
Your creature already has his own personality.

412
01:00:58,659 --> 01:00:59,619
What is his personality?

413
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:02,420
But you can alter and shape it by...

414
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:04,980
Oh, I thought he was going to eat her.

415
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:11,269
Punish your creature to stop him doing things like that.

416
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:14,039
I thought he was going to eat her.

417
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:15,719
Oh, that just gets shit out of me.

418
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,239
Punish.

419
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:28,889
Hold down the action button over the creature to zoom in on him.

420
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:35,369
Now, slap him by moving your hand quickly from side to side across him.

421
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:36,409
There it is. Good job.

422
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:50,630
You want to encourage him to do things like that, do you?

423
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:52,869
Well, it's up to you.

424
01:01:52,869 --> 01:01:55,429
I'll return when your creature is behaving a bit better.

425
01:01:55,429 --> 01:01:56,309
He's like, haha.

426
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,559
I can do those things. I don't even care.

427
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:08,280
You're a little weirdo, huh?

428
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,420
All right. Feed.

429
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:17,179
Play with your ball.

430
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:32,889
Wait. No, no, no, no.

431
01:02:32,889 --> 01:02:34,010
This is the fucking...

432
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:35,530
Okay. That guy is the carver.

433
01:02:36,329 --> 01:02:46,380
Okay. Let's go find another scroll.

434
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:51,289
He needs to grow up, too.

435
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:52,250
They get older, actually.

436
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,130
They actually grow up.

437
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:55,369
All right. How are we doing on food?

438
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,099
Feed him. Feed him. Feed him.

439
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:00,139
All right. Do we have any more...

440
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,179
Animals?

441
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,760
Here. I have this.

442
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:17,699
There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.

443
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:18,500
All right. Well, hold on.

444
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:24,360
Hey! Sable, the creature droid that is trying to attract our attention.

445
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:33,030
Eat. Eat.

446
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,980
It says rub his belly to make him want to eat.

447
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:48,900
Stop playing and eat.

448
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,300
You're going to lose the ball.

449
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,019
I'm not going to get it.

450
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:53,300
I'm not getting it for you if you lose it.

451
01:03:54,019 --> 01:03:55,639
Yeah. You can't even hit it.

452
01:03:56,519 --> 01:03:58,360
All right. Well...

453
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:05,400
Hey! Sable, the creature droid that is trying to attract our attention.

454
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,639
All right. Eat.

455
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:09,929
Eat this.

456
01:04:12,579 --> 01:04:13,619
You're hungry. Eat.

457
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:16,760
Eat!

458
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:19,159
That's the stomach.

459
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:34,219
What? He thought about that.

460
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:35,900
He had like a moral conflict there.

461
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,460
What was that?

462
01:04:40,099 --> 01:04:40,820
That was weird.

463
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:43,139
That was weird.

464
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:46,659
Sable, the creature droid that is trying to attract our attention.

465
01:04:46,659 --> 01:04:47,699
Yeah. But hold on.

466
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:49,539
Where's the silver scroll on the beach?

467
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,099
I want to get more toys and stuff.

468
01:04:52,099 --> 01:04:53,460
Is it on the beach?

469
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,260
What did he say it was?

470
01:04:55,219 --> 01:04:55,699
There it is.

471
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:05,429
Hi, man. Neat stone circle.

472
01:05:05,429 --> 01:05:07,190
It's a bummer that some are missing.

473
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:09,989
Sounds like we can help there.

474
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:11,590
What?

475
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:15,510
Help test the loaded sack of burnt-out neurons.

476
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:18,230
The stones have to play a scale.

477
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:19,349
That's what we need.

478
01:05:19,989 --> 01:05:22,230
Tap a stone to hear its note.

479
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:26,679
Okay. It has to play a certain song.

480
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,809
Cool. Okay. Now what?

481
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:51,449
Let's find the stones to put in the stone circle.

482
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:55,460
Let's find the stones.

483
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,099
That's going to be a pain in the ass.

484
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:01,980
Kill that guy.

485
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,920
Let's find the stones.

486
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:10,920
Good luck with that shit.

487
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:12,280
I found one.

488
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:24,460
Does it play?

489
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:27,510
It's one, two, three.

490
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:29,269
One, two, three.

491
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,119
All right.

492
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:34,920
Well, no, I didn't.

493
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,880
I just have to find them.

494
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,760
It's not Simon Says.

495
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,400
I just eventually have to find them all.

496
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,280
All right. That's fine.

497
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,960
Let's go back to the scroll over here.

498
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,880
Wait. Find another one right here.

499
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:52,519
It's an omega symbol.

500
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:56,900
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

501
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,940
This guy's freaking me out.

502
01:06:58,739 --> 01:06:59,699
Who are you?

503
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:00,500
What do you want with me?

504
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:02,260
Can I throw a boulder at him?

505
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:08,889
And what does this one say?

506
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,449
Silver rewards scrolls are not vital.

507
01:07:11,449 --> 01:07:12,489
Yeah, I know that.

508
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,539
You can throw in different ways.

509
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:18,900
A long smooth throw sends the missile low along the ground

510
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,539
and a quick hand move release will throw the object higher.

511
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:24,070
Yeah. All right.

512
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:24,630
Let's go do this.

513
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,500
It's time to take him for a walk.

514
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:29,820
Okay.

515
01:07:32,699 --> 01:07:34,699
This is the leash of learning.

516
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:35,739
Please click on it

517
01:07:35,739 --> 01:07:37,900
and I'll show you how to use it with your creature.

518
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,619
He's going to like stuff it on people and shit, isn't he?

519
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:44,489
All right. Here we go.

520
01:07:44,489 --> 01:07:46,489
Good. Now click on your creature.

521
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,510
Now you've got some direct control of the little beast.

522
01:07:51,909 --> 01:07:52,550
On a leash.

523
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:55,849
You didn't wait. Where's this other pig?

524
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:58,250
You can pull the creature about with the leash.

525
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:01,849
You see that tree over there?

526
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:04,179
Yeah.

527
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,659
Try pulling your creature towards it.

528
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:09,219
Click the action button on the ground to hurry him up.

529
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:09,539
Okay.

530
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,820
So let's go.

531
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:19,880
Come over here.

532
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:25,029
Good work.

533
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:30,140
You got it. Very well done.

534
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,460
Excellent. Well done.

535
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,779
Did you know that you can use a leash

536
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:36,619
to make your creature interact with objects?

537
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:39,260
Oh, I can try getting him to pick up that cow over there.

538
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:41,819
He loves picking up.

539
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:45,979
Wait, that's a hand with the leash over the cow.

540
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:47,420
Then click the action button.

541
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:55,420
Uh, yes, she will be doing this.

542
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:56,859
I didn't have to.

543
01:09:00,939 --> 01:09:03,819
Well done. You see the leash is very useful.

544
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:06,699
It'll do him good.

545
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:10,619
You can drop the leash by shaking your hand left and right quickly.

546
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:11,260
He's like, bye.

547
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:14,500
Shake your hand.

548
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:14,819
Okay.

549
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:16,729
What do you want to do?

550
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:18,810
All right. Let's go for a walk.

551
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:26,380
Let's go for a walk through town.

552
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:39,500
Take him to the sheep.

553
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,859
No, look at how small he is.

554
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:42,140
Do you see how big the sheep was?

555
01:09:42,699 --> 01:09:43,180
Wait a minute.

556
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:44,779
Holy fuck.

557
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:48,729
The sheep is like 500 times his size.

558
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,029
Uh, I don't think he's...

559
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:54,470
I'm not, I'm not going over there.

560
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:01,529
Let's go in here.

561
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,640
It's a friend.

562
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,159
I highly doubt that shit.

563
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:11,699
All right, let's go.

564
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:18,180
Look, everybody's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.

565
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,140
Look who's here.

566
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,180
Look, he's getting smarter.

567
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,779
He's like, whoa, these people.

568
01:10:23,529 --> 01:10:24,890
What is this stuff?

569
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:31,619
Oh, who's just chasing them around?

570
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:35,260
Just let him, let him, let him learn.

571
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:42,890
Let him think he's getting, yes, that's a person.

572
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:43,369
That's correct.

573
01:10:44,329 --> 01:10:45,449
He's getting brain power.

574
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:47,529
Are they all running away scared?

575
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,850
I don't think so.

576
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:52,579
Where's he going?

577
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:54,739
Where are you going?

578
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,750
What is he doing?

579
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,590
He's, oh, he's just running around the perimeter.

580
01:11:05,109 --> 01:11:06,470
Uh, all right, all right.

581
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,949
You don't, you really don't need to do laps around the building.

582
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,390
But maybe you do.

583
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:17,909
What is he doing?

584
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,770
He's getting exercise.

585
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:22,810
He's doing cardio.

586
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:34,949
He's going to get big and strong and he needs to do his cardio laps.

587
01:11:34,949 --> 01:11:35,750
Give him a name.

588
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:37,270
I don't know yet.

589
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:38,069
Let's see.

590
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:40,649
Ooh, what happened?

591
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:42,810
Oh, I, he, oh, I deletion.

592
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:51,220
Oh, he wants to go home.

593
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:51,619
Okay.

594
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:52,260
All right, we'll go home.

595
01:11:55,539 --> 01:11:56,420
Will he eat trees?

596
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:00,069
Hold on.

597
01:12:00,069 --> 01:12:00,869
What can I get?

598
01:12:00,869 --> 01:12:01,270
Hunger.

599
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:01,670
He's hungry.

600
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:02,229
He's tired.

601
01:12:02,869 --> 01:12:09,770
He doesn't, he's not going to eat wood.

602
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:13,659
Yeah, you're doing great.

603
01:12:13,659 --> 01:12:13,899
Okay.

604
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:16,140
What about like just trees?

605
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:18,550
Will he eat this?

606
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:20,680
Here.

607
01:12:25,029 --> 01:12:29,109
Do you eat trees?

608
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:35,960
Oh, I guess this is, oh, oh, wait, hold on.

609
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,949
Hey, I guess you don't like it.

610
01:12:42,949 --> 01:12:43,510
Okay.

611
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:44,869
I'll get, I'll, I'll get rid of it.

612
01:12:44,869 --> 01:12:45,189
All right.

613
01:12:45,189 --> 01:12:45,590
All right.

614
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:45,989
Jesus.

615
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:49,449
He thinks he's so funny.

616
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:49,930
That's fine.

617
01:12:56,630 --> 01:13:01,050
He's spoiled.

618
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:02,970
There's more to learn about leashes.

619
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:06,090
I didn't tell you that you can attach the leash to objects.

620
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,850
Try leashing the creature to this tree.

621
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,130
Make it so he can't go anywhere.

622
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,020
With the leash attached to your hand, move it over the tree.

623
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:16,180
Okay.

624
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:22,220
Double click the action button to attach the leash.

625
01:13:22,859 --> 01:13:29,350
Attach your creature to the sparkly tree.

626
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:31,430
What did he do?

627
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:31,909
Did he eat?

628
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:50,300
With the leash attached to your creature, double click on the tree.

629
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,500
Why did he do that?

630
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,140
Double click the action button to attach the leash.

631
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,340
It wasn't funny.

632
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:56,140
It's not funny.

633
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:56,779
It is funny.

634
01:13:56,779 --> 01:13:57,100
Fuck it.

635
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:57,500
Who cares?

636
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,020
Like he leaned out and did this like dance.

637
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:01,420
Okay.

638
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:01,819
Whatever.

639
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:06,869
Good.

640
01:14:06,869 --> 01:14:08,710
The leash is very useful.

641
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,390
Your creature is tied to the tree now.

642
01:14:10,949 --> 01:14:13,189
You interact with whatever his leash to as well.

643
01:14:14,949 --> 01:14:17,829
If you click on a leash when the creature is attached to something,

644
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:19,029
you can adjust its length.

645
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:23,029
I didn't, that was, he did it like four times in a row.

646
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:25,750
This is the leash of aggression.

647
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,829
It encourages your creature to get angry.

648
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:33,430
This is the fluffy leash of compassion.

649
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,270
It makes your creature behave nicely.

650
01:14:37,109 --> 01:14:39,430
Why not experiment with these leashes?

651
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,630
They're powerful tools.

652
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:42,710
I'll bid you farewell.

653
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,949
You now know as much about creatures as I do.

654
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:50,069
Legends tell of an ancient creature somewhere on this land.

655
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:52,390
We've seen him already, but I've never seen him.

656
01:14:52,949 --> 01:14:54,470
He hides from us humans,

657
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,069
but he has great knowledge, I think.

658
01:14:56,069 --> 01:14:56,949
It's a giant sheep.

659
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:00,390
Hey, Mini Clips.

660
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:01,189
Thanks for the five subs.

661
01:15:01,189 --> 01:15:01,590
Appreciate it.

662
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:04,779
It's the sniper.

663
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:12,439
There are advanced techniques for using the leash.

664
01:15:12,439 --> 01:15:14,039
Find them on this signpost.

665
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,640
No, you can't go that way.

666
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:19,220
All right.

667
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:22,520
Don't do it.

668
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:25,140
Oh my fucking god, he ate her.

669
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:41,220
Can we not get quests anymore?

670
01:15:44,569 --> 01:15:45,369
That was bad.

671
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,500
No, that wasn't good.

672
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,380
Not funny.

673
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:50,020
Not funny.

674
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:50,659
Don't do that.

675
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,060
Not funny.

676
01:15:53,859 --> 01:15:54,659
Here, let me just...

677
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,060
I don't want to...

678
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:58,819
Is there any way?

679
01:15:58,819 --> 01:15:59,699
Can I scold him?

680
01:16:00,819 --> 01:16:04,250
How do you scold?

681
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:04,649
I don't want to...

682
01:16:05,689 --> 01:16:09,050
There's only one way you can do that.

683
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,409
It's like, all right, he's...

684
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:13,989
He's going to start to become unbearable.

685
01:16:13,989 --> 01:16:14,470
You know what I mean?

686
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:16,550
Like he's going to eat quest givers and shit.

687
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:17,909
I don't know if we can handle this.

688
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,630
Don't do that.

689
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:21,670
Let's stop.

690
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:21,909
I'm...

691
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:22,470
I'm...

692
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:28,100
Okay, I just didn't...

693
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:28,979
All right, all right, all right.

694
01:16:29,859 --> 01:16:30,579
Oh, fuck.

695
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,779
Oh, I don't want to do that.

696
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:34,260
All right.

697
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:36,659
You can restrict the area in which your creature...

698
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,369
Jesus Christ.

699
01:16:53,579 --> 01:16:55,100
First, what is he doing?

700
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:00,220
You can restrict the area in which your creature can move when he's on the leash.

701
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,220
First, you attach the leash to an object and...

702
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:04,300
Okay, that's area restricted.

703
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:09,880
He's thinking about...

704
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,199
What?

705
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,279
Look, this motherfucker just ain't the quest giver.

706
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:16,600
Okay?

707
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:27,050
All right, click on...

708
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:28,409
Click on...

709
01:17:28,409 --> 01:17:29,050
All right, we're fine.

710
01:17:29,609 --> 01:17:30,409
Pull to stretch the...

711
01:17:30,409 --> 01:17:31,770
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

712
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:33,130
First, you attach the leash to an object

713
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:35,130
and click the action button anymore on the leash to pick it up.

714
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:35,689
Okay.

715
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:38,489
You can pull to stretch the leash to the length you want it to be.

716
01:17:39,289 --> 01:17:39,689
I see.

717
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:42,220
So you can do...

718
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,100
Okay, that makes sense.

719
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:44,859
All right, let's go find...

720
01:17:45,979 --> 01:17:47,500
You're encouraging him to eat people.

721
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,659
You're fucking fused.

722
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:59,689
I was fucked up the second she was done talking.

723
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:08,060
Did you know the creature pen is where you'll find your creature's leashes?

724
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,340
You can also use different leashes to directly influence your creature's mood.

725
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:17,500
There is the leash of learning, which makes your creature mimic your own action.

726
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:22,140
The leash of aggression, which will make him angry and the leash of compassion.

727
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,420
So he's on the leash of learning right now.

728
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:23,659
Okay.

729
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,420
Does he want to sleep out there?

730
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:26,300
Let's get rid of the leash.

731
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:36,010
Go to bed.

732
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:43,779
How does he have to have that, like, big ass bruise?

733
01:18:43,779 --> 01:18:45,460
Like, I didn't even want to do that.

734
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,539
All right.

735
01:18:47,539 --> 01:18:48,100
Go to bed.

736
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:53,050
Good.

737
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:53,689
Okay.

738
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:59,560
So I got the leash of learning on right now.

739
01:18:59,560 --> 01:18:59,880
All right.

740
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,159
Here we go.

741
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:05,880
There's a silver reward squirrel on the beach behind those huge gates.

742
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:06,600
I know.

743
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,840
There's a bunch of reward squirrels everywhere.

744
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,720
There's one here, too.

745
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,479
Remember, he ate a person.

746
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:13,880
I know.

747
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,439
It was an important person, too.

748
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:23,460
By the great gods, I've been asleep.

749
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:26,260
I was just counting my sheep when I dozed off.

750
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:29,260
Please find my strange sheep.

751
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:39,289
Well, they were going to be slaughtered anyway.

752
01:19:39,289 --> 01:19:42,489
I say we waste the wandering mutton.

753
01:19:42,489 --> 01:19:46,569
But if we find and return them, we'll have a diet in the wolf follower.

754
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:47,689
Wow.

755
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:49,529
The saintly one made a joke.

756
01:19:50,569 --> 01:19:53,859
What is that?

757
01:19:53,859 --> 01:19:54,340
Ooh.

758
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:54,659
Okay.

759
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:55,859
So we're going to find you sheep.

760
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:02,779
Found one.

761
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:03,340
Here.

762
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,220
Is this what you're looking for?

763
01:20:04,939 --> 01:20:06,600
There's one right there, right?

764
01:20:07,989 --> 01:20:09,510
Many thanks, higher power.

765
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:10,550
Keep them coming, please.

766
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,739
Well, it's your problem.

767
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:14,539
This is your problem.

768
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:18,569
What is this place?

769
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:24,090
Did you know children stay safely in the creche until they reach adulthood?

770
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,289
The creche is a settlement.

771
01:20:25,289 --> 01:20:27,609
It encourages people to have more children.

772
01:20:27,609 --> 01:20:27,850
All right.

773
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:29,850
So this is like a little daycare.

774
01:20:30,649 --> 01:20:33,750
All right.

775
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,310
Makes sense.

776
01:20:35,899 --> 01:20:39,500
If you drop a person by a job, they'll become a disciple and do that job indefinitely

777
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,539
until you stop them by picking them up and shaking your hand to release them.

778
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:42,779
Okay.

779
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,680
You create as many disciples as you like.

780
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,619
Shake your hand when you've got the leash and you release it, right?

781
01:20:51,619 --> 01:20:56,100
You can leash your creature to any object by double clicking the action button on the object.

782
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,300
Pressing this key leashes attaches the leash to your creature.

783
01:20:59,300 --> 01:20:59,939
Right.

784
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:00,739
Oh, what are you doing?

785
01:21:05,909 --> 01:21:06,710
Why are you going over here?

786
01:21:13,029 --> 01:21:14,229
Not over by the children.

787
01:21:15,029 --> 01:21:15,989
Not by the children.

788
01:21:15,989 --> 01:21:16,710
He's on the loose.

789
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:23,720
What's he doing?

790
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,399
He's just like sprinting around.

791
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:29,909
He's completely, completely out of control.

792
01:21:30,789 --> 01:21:35,300
I mean, he's not doing it.

793
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,260
He's all right here.

794
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:43,130
Stay over here.

795
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,399
Just like relax.

796
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,159
Just chill.

797
01:21:52,819 --> 01:21:53,859
He's the worst.

798
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:55,939
He's really, really the worst.

799
01:21:57,739 --> 01:21:58,140
All right.

800
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,220
Just don't kill anybody please while I'm doing this.

801
01:22:00,859 --> 01:22:01,100
All right.

802
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:01,739
Look at the sheep.

803
01:22:02,789 --> 01:22:03,590
How are you doing actually?

804
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:11,020
He wanted to kick down.

805
01:22:11,739 --> 01:22:12,460
Stay.

806
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:12,960
No.

807
01:22:14,979 --> 01:22:16,659
Stop.

808
01:22:19,289 --> 01:22:20,970
He's just shitting.

809
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:22,729
Stop.

810
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:23,130
Stop.

811
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:23,609
Stop.

812
01:22:23,609 --> 01:22:24,409
Stay back here.

813
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:27,050
Stay.

814
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:29,189
Don't move.

815
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:31,600
No.

816
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:33,840
Relax.

817
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:39,529
Don't.

818
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:41,130
Just quit being such an asshole.

819
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:42,729
Did I do this to you?

820
01:22:43,449 --> 01:22:44,069
All right.

821
01:22:44,069 --> 01:22:44,310
All right.

822
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:44,550
All right.

823
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:44,789
All right.

824
01:22:44,789 --> 01:22:46,390
I gotta find video over here.

825
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:46,890
Sheep and...

826
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:53,800
Okay.

827
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:54,760
We need to make some jobs.

828
01:22:56,729 --> 01:22:57,210
Uh, you...

829
01:22:57,770 --> 01:23:00,020
Let's have you be...

830
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:02,739
Uh, okay.

831
01:23:02,739 --> 01:23:03,939
Disciple Breeder.

832
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,300
Some breeding maybe?

833
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:08,010
Disciple Breeder.

834
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:15,859
He just killed somebody.

835
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:20,659
There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.

836
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:35,029
Where are you going?

837
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,899
I don't even know what to do with you anymore.

838
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:44,279
Oh, he was thirsty.

839
01:23:48,699 --> 01:23:49,020
All right.

840
01:23:49,819 --> 01:23:50,539
Please be good.

841
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:54,810
All right.

842
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:55,130
All right.

843
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:55,369
All right.

844
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:55,609
All right.

845
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:55,850
All right.

846
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:56,810
All right.

847
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:58,819
I can't attach you to this.

848
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:00,180
Just stay over here.

849
01:24:01,449 --> 01:24:02,170
Just look.

850
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:02,890
Play with your ball.

851
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:03,130
See?

852
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:04,810
Cool, huh?

853
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:05,210
Good.

854
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:05,449
All right.

855
01:24:05,449 --> 01:24:06,649
Now let me continue the game, please.

856
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:10,300
All right.

857
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,340
We got sheep for you.

858
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:12,300
There's another one over here.

859
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:14,949
There was another scroll.

860
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:15,510
Where was it?

861
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:16,550
Okay.

862
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,350
There's this right here.

863
01:24:22,859 --> 01:24:25,180
There's a huge creature in the valley beyond.

864
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:28,840
We're all terrified.

865
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,000
This must be the creature that Sable spoke of.

866
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,199
Let's investigate.

867
01:24:35,609 --> 01:24:35,930
Okay.

868
01:24:37,029 --> 01:24:37,430
Mm-hmm.

869
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,840
Look at the size of that.

870
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,760
Ah, okay.

871
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:47,800
We're dead.

872
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,079
We're all dead.

873
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:49,560
He's gonna come get us.

874
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:50,520
What is it?

875
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,800
Where is it from?

876
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,199
It doesn't seem to be aggressive, though.

877
01:24:54,199 --> 01:24:56,359
If it is, we're all dead.

878
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:57,560
Even our spirits.

879
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,039
Dead.

880
01:24:58,039 --> 01:24:58,840
You too, boss.

881
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,279
Pick up a rock and throw it at it.

882
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:02,600
It's dead.

883
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,680
This giant is communicating.

884
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,359
It's telepathic.

885
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:07,880
You have a creature.

886
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:08,680
Bring him to me.

887
01:25:09,319 --> 01:25:10,039
Oh, no.

888
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:11,239
No way.

889
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:12,359
He'll eat him.

890
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:14,760
But this giant looks friendly.

891
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,079
Let's bring our creature over with the leash.

892
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:18,920
I am not proud of my son.

893
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,239
So I don't know if I'm gonna like this.

894
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:24,840
Please use the leash to bring your creature to me.

895
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,760
What if he just starts farting and kicking things

896
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,279
and eating people in front of him?

897
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:35,640
It's gonna be really embarrassing.

898
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:38,550
There you are.

899
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:39,270
All right, come here.

900
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:50,890
Over this way.

901
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:55,699
He must be judged.

902
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:03,979
Derva hates him already.

903
01:26:03,979 --> 01:26:04,619
I don't hate...

904
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:05,659
I think he's funny.

905
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:09,539
But he's not...

906
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:10,979
He's not wholesome.

907
01:26:10,979 --> 01:26:11,699
He's just...

908
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:13,140
He's just mean and weird.

909
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:15,880
All right.

910
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:20,470
Please use the leash to bring your creature to me.

911
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:23,430
This is an important weird God interview.

912
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:24,229
Don't embarrass me.

913
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:31,340
I do hope they'll be friends.

914
01:26:38,869 --> 01:26:44,779
Another creature?

915
01:26:44,779 --> 01:26:45,500
Is it true?

916
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:46,939
Are you real?

917
01:26:47,899 --> 01:26:49,539
I've been doing the same...

918
01:26:49,539 --> 01:26:50,659
You're doing the same stance.

919
01:26:50,659 --> 01:26:53,539
I thought I would die without ever seeing another God.

920
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:54,899
I like you.

921
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:56,100
Or another creature.

922
01:26:56,899 --> 01:26:59,159
Am I mocking him with this person?

923
01:26:59,159 --> 01:27:00,119
I don't understand.

924
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:03,560
I once belonged to Nemesis, the most powerful of gods.

925
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,920
But his power kept growing

926
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,000
and soon I wasn't old enough for him.

927
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,800
So I was cast out, banished here

928
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,560
and I've been alone ever since.

929
01:27:17,079 --> 01:27:17,640
Until now.

930
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:19,239
Well, you just...

931
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:19,960
I'm not...

932
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,000
I'm not hiring.

933
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:25,479
This being is astonishing, but what a sad tale.

934
01:27:25,479 --> 01:27:29,079
In return for your friendship and that of your creature,

935
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:30,439
I will teach you both.

936
01:27:31,899 --> 01:27:33,979
You will both learn the ways of the gods.

937
01:27:37,609 --> 01:27:39,850
When you are ready for the first lesson,

938
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:41,770
meet me at the village through this pass.

939
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:42,729
There's another village.

940
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:49,989
He's like, wait, where are you going?

941
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,340
I want to go see the big guy again.

942
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:05,539
I'm gonna let him do it.

943
01:28:05,539 --> 01:28:06,180
He needs to learn.

944
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,140
He's got to be on his own.

945
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:16,630
He's so dopey.

946
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:26,939
Should I be bringing him over here?

947
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,659
Maybe I shouldn't even be doing this.

948
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:47,739
Derma, I fucking hate this cow so much.

949
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:54,060
Well, I'm sorry, but this is our child right now.

950
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,140
So it's too bad.

951
01:28:56,859 --> 01:29:05,380
Wait, you don't want to go over there?

952
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,100
No, no, no, no.

953
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:06,819
Come on, let's go.

954
01:29:08,779 --> 01:29:11,560
Follow me.

955
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,039
There he is.

956
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:12,920
All right, now let's learn.

957
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:25,640
This cow is better than bugleberry.

958
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,880
Oh boy, I can see that.

959
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,939
All right, here we are.

960
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:35,369
This is the Aztec village.

961
01:29:35,369 --> 01:29:38,090
I will teach you the first secret here.

962
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:39,529
It's not going to be like burn it down.

963
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:42,489
These people do not yet believe in you as a god.

964
01:29:43,609 --> 01:29:46,659
To grow in power, you and your creature

965
01:29:46,659 --> 01:29:49,060
can impress them until they believe in you.

966
01:29:49,859 --> 01:29:53,079
Look at the village store.

967
01:29:53,079 --> 01:29:55,640
The flag shows that they need food.

968
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:56,220
Hmm.

969
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:00,039
If you give them some, they'll think it's a miracle

970
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:01,720
and will believe in you more.

971
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:07,159
They call the signpost to find out more about desire flags.

972
01:30:07,159 --> 01:30:08,680
Yeah, they need food and yeah.

973
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,159
All right, I got some extra food.

974
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:22,420
Imagine if the cow just turned over and picked him up.

975
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:23,779
This is a food miracle.

976
01:30:23,779 --> 01:30:25,939
You can cast one food miracle.

977
01:30:26,579 --> 01:30:30,020
You can pick up such one shot miracles with the action button

978
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:36,710
and activate them by tapping them with the same button like this.

979
01:30:46,970 --> 01:30:47,850
What animal is that?

980
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:53,369
I hear that all the time in random animal sounds.

981
01:30:53,369 --> 01:30:56,090
Things like this really impress the creatures.

982
01:30:57,369 --> 01:31:00,729
If your creature is on the road, he will learn this miracle.

983
01:31:00,729 --> 01:31:02,329
I need to know exactly what that animal is.

984
01:31:03,609 --> 01:31:08,199
I hear it all the time.

985
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:11,239
If your creature is on the rope leash,

986
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:13,479
he'll learn this miracle when you cast it.

987
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:17,579
All right, so this is the teaching one.

988
01:31:17,579 --> 01:31:21,260
Tap on the miracle and click the action button on the Aztec village store.

989
01:31:21,819 --> 01:31:24,460
Okay, let's get a leash on you so you learn this.

990
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:27,050
Yes.

991
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:32,760
You picked up the miracle instead of tapping it.

992
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,199
Drop it and try again.

993
01:31:48,199 --> 01:31:49,319
Well done.

994
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:52,359
Now click the action button over the village store.

995
01:31:52,359 --> 01:31:53,239
I can't be on a leash.

996
01:31:53,239 --> 01:31:54,359
Didn't it say if he's on a leash?

997
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:59,510
I thought it said he'll learn if he's on a leash.

998
01:32:00,149 --> 01:32:01,380
Come here.

999
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,220
Get over here.

1000
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:04,260
Stop chasing stuff.

1001
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:05,460
What is that?

1002
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,340
Is it a bird?

1003
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:07,300
Oh, he's eating.

1004
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,180
Okay, he's eating things.

1005
01:32:08,979 --> 01:32:12,659
Come here.

1006
01:32:12,659 --> 01:32:13,779
No, stop sleeping.

1007
01:32:13,779 --> 01:32:14,659
Why are you sleeping?

1008
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:18,260
I just casted the miracle on the ground.

1009
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:19,300
Well done.

1010
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,699
Now click the action button over the village store.

1011
01:32:21,699 --> 01:32:23,140
I'm trying to get him to move.

1012
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:24,659
Get over here.

1013
01:32:24,659 --> 01:32:25,140
Let's go.

1014
01:32:30,979 --> 01:32:32,340
What an embarrassment.

1015
01:32:38,939 --> 01:32:39,420
All right.

1016
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:39,899
They believe.

1017
01:32:40,939 --> 01:32:41,819
That's a lot more.

1018
01:32:41,819 --> 01:32:42,619
Never mind.

1019
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:46,649
Look at him.

1020
01:32:46,649 --> 01:32:47,369
Look at Adam.

1021
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:47,770
Good.

1022
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:48,810
He's like sizing him up.

1023
01:32:52,869 --> 01:32:56,149
I have created more food miracles for you to practice with.

1024
01:32:57,449 --> 01:33:01,050
At the village center, you can see your symbol.

1025
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:05,529
When it reaches the stone hand there, the village will believe in you.

1026
01:33:05,529 --> 01:33:06,810
My symbol?

1027
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:10,970
Holding your hand over it shows how much belief the people have in you.

1028
01:33:12,329 --> 01:33:13,850
I need sleep.

1029
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:18,489
Wake me when the village believes in you and you are ready to continue your education.

1030
01:33:18,489 --> 01:33:18,729
Okay.

1031
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:20,890
When it reaches the stone.

1032
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:21,130
All right.

1033
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:21,529
Cool.

1034
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:22,569
So let's make them believe.

1035
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:27,180
He just lies on the ground over here.

1036
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:28,140
All right.

1037
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:29,100
Should I drop a rock in his head?

1038
01:33:29,819 --> 01:33:30,060
All right.

1039
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:32,140
I'm going to throw a huge rock and drop it on his head.

1040
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:32,779
Should I do that?

1041
01:33:34,619 --> 01:33:34,939
All right.

1042
01:33:34,939 --> 01:33:35,500
Let them sleep.

1043
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:39,619
They can just hang out.

1044
01:33:40,739 --> 01:33:42,020
I'm going to do some more food miracles.

1045
01:33:44,069 --> 01:33:50,659
X will worship you now.

1046
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:56,180
You have not investigated many silver reward scrolls, leader.

1047
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:57,140
Try a few.

1048
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:57,859
It'll be worth it.

1049
01:33:57,859 --> 01:33:59,220
You really want me to do the side quests.

1050
01:33:59,220 --> 01:33:59,779
I know you do.

1051
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:01,880
Hold on.

1052
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:13,939
All right.

1053
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:14,819
They believe in me now.

1054
01:34:14,819 --> 01:34:15,060
Good.

1055
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:20,180
Villages are impressed by the actions of gods, especially when they fulfill the people's desires.

1056
01:34:20,899 --> 01:34:24,100
Do impressive things like throwing objects around, use creatures in the village,

1057
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:24,979
and cast miracles.

1058
01:34:24,979 --> 01:34:25,460
You'll see.

1059
01:34:26,659 --> 01:34:28,340
You will see the belief in.

1060
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:31,050
All right.

1061
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:31,609
Let's get some.

1062
01:34:32,409 --> 01:34:33,050
Let's get some.

1063
01:34:34,579 --> 01:34:35,699
Disciple builder.

1064
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:36,899
Builder.

1065
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:39,300
Disciple forester.

1066
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,619
Disciple forester.

1067
01:34:41,619 --> 01:34:41,859
All right.

1068
01:34:41,859 --> 01:34:42,340
Let's have some.

1069
01:34:42,979 --> 01:34:44,180
How many people live in this village?

1070
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:44,659
Can I tell?

1071
01:34:45,859 --> 01:34:47,380
This is the village center.

1072
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:50,739
Placing your hand over it will show how much belief is needed before the village is yours.

1073
01:34:51,699 --> 01:34:54,739
As you do impressive things in the village, you will see numbers come up over the villager.

1074
01:34:54,739 --> 01:34:57,460
This is the amount of belief you have gained for your actions.

1075
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:57,939
That's right.

1076
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,819
I need 199 belief before this village is mine.

1077
01:35:01,859 --> 01:35:03,939
So where'd he go?

1078
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:06,859
Where'd he go?

1079
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:27,220
Where is he?

1080
01:35:33,369 --> 01:35:33,609
Oh.

1081
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:39,880
How do I locate my creature?

1082
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,239
Did he go home?

1083
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:51,659
There's a silver reward for on the beach behind those huge gifts.

1084
01:35:51,659 --> 01:35:52,380
Where did he go?

1085
01:35:55,109 --> 01:35:56,630
He took off and ran away.

1086
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:59,590
Oh, there he is.

1087
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:00,789
Okay.

1088
01:36:00,789 --> 01:36:01,029
Yeah.

1089
01:36:01,029 --> 01:36:01,510
Press C.

1090
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:04,869
How you doing?

1091
01:36:04,869 --> 01:36:05,270
You good?

1092
01:36:08,739 --> 01:36:09,539
Good?

1093
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:09,779
Good.

1094
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:16,170
Be a good boy.

1095
01:36:17,189 --> 01:36:18,869
Go do something.

1096
01:36:19,829 --> 01:36:20,229
All right.

1097
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:21,909
Let me get this squirrel over here.

1098
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:23,960
What is this?

1099
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,489
What's all the fuss?

1100
01:36:27,210 --> 01:36:32,550
A freak wave has just struck.

1101
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:34,710
My husband and four others are drowning.

1102
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:35,670
Please help them.

1103
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:36,069
Uh-oh.

1104
01:36:37,270 --> 01:36:38,260
Drowning.

1105
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,039
Let's see.

1106
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,800
Who do we know who's tall enough to wait out to him?

1107
01:36:45,319 --> 01:36:47,270
Don't muck around.

1108
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:51,029
Let's get our creature as fast as possible.

1109
01:36:51,029 --> 01:36:53,130
What do you mean our creature?

1110
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:54,090
I can't just pick him up.

1111
01:36:55,529 --> 01:36:56,090
Oh, God.

1112
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:56,649
Oh, my God.

1113
01:36:56,649 --> 01:36:57,050
Oh, my God.

1114
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:58,569
Hey, come here.

1115
01:36:59,289 --> 01:36:59,850
Go help them.

1116
01:37:00,729 --> 01:37:02,010
This way.

1117
01:37:03,369 --> 01:37:11,189
Hurry up.

1118
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:16,979
Go, go, go.

1119
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,420
Oh, they're dying.

1120
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,760
Quick to the rescue.

1121
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,720
Go get them.

1122
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,880
No, go.

1123
01:37:35,909 --> 01:37:36,789
In here.

1124
01:37:38,069 --> 01:37:38,789
In here.

1125
01:37:41,159 --> 01:37:42,119
Go in here.

1126
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:44,199
Don't fall asleep.

1127
01:37:44,199 --> 01:37:44,760
All right.

1128
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:45,319
Save them.

1129
01:37:48,619 --> 01:37:49,020
Get them.

1130
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:50,140
Save them.

1131
01:37:51,579 --> 01:37:52,539
Take them out of the water.

1132
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:54,220
Take them out of the water.

1133
01:37:55,449 --> 01:37:57,609
Take them out of the water.

1134
01:37:57,609 --> 01:37:58,890
Over there.

1135
01:37:58,890 --> 01:37:59,369
Drop them.

1136
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:01,510
Drop.

1137
01:38:02,630 --> 01:38:03,029
Drop it.

1138
01:38:05,029 --> 01:38:05,350
Drop it.

1139
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:05,510
All right.

1140
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:05,909
Do it again.

1141
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:14,409
What did he just do?

1142
01:38:17,659 --> 01:38:18,699
Did he just push his head under?

1143
01:38:21,529 --> 01:38:22,170
Quick, quick, quick.

1144
01:38:25,609 --> 01:38:26,250
Drop it.

1145
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:27,079
Good job.

1146
01:38:32,119 --> 01:38:32,520
Save them.

1147
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:35,689
All right.

1148
01:38:35,689 --> 01:38:36,409
Do it again.

1149
01:38:36,409 --> 01:38:36,810
Back up.

1150
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:42,779
One more.

1151
01:38:50,439 --> 01:38:50,760
All right.

1152
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:51,000
Go.

1153
01:38:57,590 --> 01:38:58,229
Nice job.

1154
01:38:58,229 --> 01:38:58,630
You did it.

1155
01:38:59,189 --> 01:39:00,630
You actually did something good.

1156
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:02,149
I like, I'm starting to like you.

1157
01:39:02,789 --> 01:39:13,590
At least some survived.

1158
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:14,949
We're a little thankful for that.

1159
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:20,069
I'm refreshed and ready to start teaching your little creature more.

1160
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:26,699
He's out of control.

1161
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,220
I'm sorry.

1162
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:30,460
There's no, I, he did, at least he did a three.

1163
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:33,100
At least he did three.

1164
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:38,699
He may have like snapped a person in half, but he did three out of four.

1165
01:39:39,819 --> 01:39:41,340
All right.

1166
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,859
We have to go teach him some more things.

1167
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:51,369
He's using the tree now.

1168
01:39:51,369 --> 01:39:52,409
That's actually interesting.

1169
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:54,170
Why is he using the tree?

1170
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:56,310
What about her?

1171
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:56,869
What about him?

1172
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:59,460
What's your problem?

1173
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:01,609
He doesn't like you.

1174
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:03,930
Why do you, you don't like, why?

1175
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:04,729
What's his face?

1176
01:40:05,609 --> 01:40:06,649
Did you see that?

1177
01:40:06,649 --> 01:40:07,850
Look at that frown.

1178
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:11,670
All right.

1179
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:13,029
Come look up to go back to the big sheep.

1180
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:16,569
He's hungry.

1181
01:40:17,449 --> 01:40:17,689
All right.

1182
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:19,050
Well, let me get him some food.

1183
01:40:26,359 --> 01:40:27,239
Oh, he's going home.

1184
01:40:27,239 --> 01:40:27,399
All right.

1185
01:40:27,399 --> 01:40:28,439
Let's give him some food.

1186
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:29,399
He needs to eat something.

1187
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:35,140
We need like a pig or something or a sheep.

1188
01:40:38,539 --> 01:40:41,180
And he's just, I know I can follow him later.

1189
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:42,380
He's just doing his own fucking thing.

1190
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:43,180
Whatever.

1191
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:47,420
There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.

1192
01:40:48,779 --> 01:40:50,859
We need a sheep or a cow.

1193
01:40:53,739 --> 01:40:54,060
All right.

1194
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:55,020
Who cares about that?

1195
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:56,460
We'll just feed this here.

1196
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:06,760
Come here.

1197
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,060
There.

1198
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:09,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

1199
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:10,300
That's probably, I just heard him.

1200
01:41:11,739 --> 01:41:12,300
Go get this.

1201
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:13,260
Come here.

1202
01:41:13,979 --> 01:41:19,850
He's like, oh, he doesn't know what to do.

1203
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:23,579
Oh, good.

1204
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:24,939
Didn't like that.

1205
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:29,619
All right.

1206
01:41:29,619 --> 01:41:30,420
Let's go see the sheep.

1207
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:32,489
Let's go.

1208
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:39,239
I mean, he's a, he's a huge sheep.

1209
01:41:39,239 --> 01:41:40,039
You really can't miss it.

1210
01:41:40,039 --> 01:41:45,210
There he is.

1211
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:46,409
Make him eat more people.

1212
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:49,930
No, I don't want him to eat people because I don't want him to bet to be a

1213
01:41:50,649 --> 01:41:52,250
thing that he just does on his own.

1214
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:54,489
He already, he's done it like twice.

1215
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:06,970
Don't feed him meat.

1216
01:42:08,619 --> 01:42:11,020
That he can eat meat, but just not people.

1217
01:42:11,739 --> 01:42:16,220
I tried to give him a tree.

1218
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:18,859
Remember he kicked it over and he looked at me and he pointed at me and laughed.

1219
01:42:19,659 --> 01:42:20,939
I tried to feed him a plant.

1220
01:42:21,739 --> 01:42:27,380
Feed him grain.

1221
01:42:29,899 --> 01:42:30,380
All right.

1222
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:30,699
Yeah.

1223
01:42:34,729 --> 01:42:35,050
All right.

1224
01:42:35,850 --> 01:42:36,489
I see.

1225
01:42:36,489 --> 01:42:36,810
I see.

1226
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:38,409
I mean, that's all right.

1227
01:42:38,409 --> 01:42:39,449
Let's learn another spell.

1228
01:42:40,649 --> 01:42:44,680
German doesn't know what cows eat.

1229
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,920
This is not even a real, this is a God cow.

1230
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,529
This is not even a cow.

1231
01:42:49,529 --> 01:42:51,130
This is like a God thing.

1232
01:42:51,689 --> 01:42:56,760
It was nemesis creature.

1233
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,000
He often sent me into battle.

1234
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,920
I foresee the same for you.

1235
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:05,659
First, I will become your size to make things easier.

1236
01:43:05,659 --> 01:43:06,539
Combat training.

1237
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,739
Be prepared to get bruised.

1238
01:43:09,739 --> 01:43:10,699
Don't worry.

1239
01:43:10,699 --> 01:43:12,060
In time, people heal.

1240
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:16,380
I love the point though.

1241
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:20,220
All right.

1242
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:20,779
Kick his ass.

1243
01:43:28,539 --> 01:43:31,960
And during the time there is a fight.

1244
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:37,270
You should know that your creature will fight without help from you.

1245
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:38,069
He doesn't want to do it.

1246
01:43:38,069 --> 01:43:38,630
He's scared.

1247
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:40,550
He said, no, no.

1248
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:43,189
I just want to eat people and shit in bushes.

1249
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:44,149
And kick balls.

1250
01:43:45,029 --> 01:43:47,579
All right.

1251
01:43:47,579 --> 01:43:47,979
Get him.

1252
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:50,789
Get him.

1253
01:43:50,789 --> 01:43:52,949
Firstly, let's learn to attack.

1254
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:58,229
Click on a part of my body using the action button to strike there.

1255
01:43:59,109 --> 01:44:03,500
Hit him in the head.

1256
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,020
A good hit.

1257
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:07,100
You can queue up multiple attacks as well.

1258
01:44:08,489 --> 01:44:10,810
Try killing up several attacks on me now.

1259
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:13,420
That's right.

1260
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:15,260
Now you must learn to block attacks.

1261
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:19,750
Click the action button on your creature to make him block.

1262
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:20,149
Block?

1263
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:22,359
Yeah.

1264
01:44:22,359 --> 01:44:23,079
You have to block.

1265
01:44:24,359 --> 01:44:25,159
That's it.

1266
01:44:25,159 --> 01:44:26,199
A good block there.

1267
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,960
You'll stop blocking if you do another command.

1268
01:44:31,159 --> 01:44:31,560
Motocombat.

1269
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:33,479
Let us concentrate on dodging.

1270
01:44:33,479 --> 01:44:34,600
There's a dodge roll.

1271
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:38,600
Click the action button anywhere on the ground to move the creature there.

1272
01:44:40,329 --> 01:44:41,050
That's it.

1273
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:42,010
You have learned well.

1274
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:46,659
Let us try some friendly combat to test these skills.

1275
01:44:46,659 --> 01:44:47,859
You got these hooves.

1276
01:44:47,859 --> 01:44:48,500
Kick him in the face.

1277
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,300
Fucking kick him.

1278
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:50,579
Just offense only.

1279
01:44:50,579 --> 01:44:51,220
All offense.

1280
01:44:56,649 --> 01:44:56,970
Oops.

1281
01:45:01,819 --> 01:45:02,859
How do I un-queue a move?

1282
01:45:17,699 --> 01:45:18,579
He's actually pretty good.

1283
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:19,619
Block.

1284
01:45:20,899 --> 01:45:21,140
Block.

1285
01:45:25,689 --> 01:45:28,920
Kick.

1286
01:45:29,399 --> 01:45:30,279
Willstruck.

1287
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:36,199
Good dodge.

1288
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:37,800
Block.

1289
01:45:42,579 --> 01:45:42,819
Block.

1290
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:49,720
Double kick.

1291
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:50,119
One more.

1292
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:51,960
Willstruck.

1293
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:55,189
You're gonna lose to Sheepwheel.

1294
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:57,029
No, you don't.

1295
01:45:57,029 --> 01:45:57,750
What are you talking about?

1296
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:01,859
I don't think I can win.

1297
01:46:01,859 --> 01:46:02,100
Yeah.

1298
01:46:05,899 --> 01:46:07,819
That was an important lesson, friend.

1299
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:17,079
You show great potential, but work on your technique.

1300
01:46:21,850 --> 01:46:22,970
Oh, it's because it's nighttime.

1301
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:23,609
Right.

1302
01:46:23,609 --> 01:46:24,250
Where's he going?

1303
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:26,890
No farewell?

1304
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:27,210
He just...

1305
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:37,800
Okay.

1306
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,020
Oh, he just gave me power.

1307
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:45,770
I have a secret for you.

1308
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:47,369
But I warn you.

1309
01:46:47,369 --> 01:46:48,890
This knowledge is dangerous.

1310
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:50,649
And you're watching the Disney Channel.

1311
01:46:53,079 --> 01:46:55,720
But come only when you are ready.

1312
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:58,680
What I will tell you is forbidden knowledge.

1313
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:00,760
Dangerous even to gods.

1314
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:03,399
It's gonna be how to create tornadoes and meteors and shit.

1315
01:47:03,399 --> 01:47:06,119
Why don't you try out what you've learned while I sleep?

1316
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:12,060
How you doing?

1317
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,020
Hungry?

1318
01:47:13,979 --> 01:47:14,479
You're alright.

1319
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:19,510
Alright, let's go rest up a little.

1320
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:20,789
Hold on, there's another squirrel over here.

1321
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:24,250
What is this?

1322
01:47:34,229 --> 01:47:35,510
How horrid.

1323
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:37,029
I think he's trying to speak.

1324
01:47:37,989 --> 01:47:39,350
Is it a bat?

1325
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:47,670
This ogre seems to be guarding something.

1326
01:47:50,869 --> 01:47:52,470
He's guarding the pass.

1327
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:54,069
He's outside our influence.

1328
01:47:54,069 --> 01:47:56,310
So let's send our creature to fight him.

1329
01:47:57,510 --> 01:48:01,720
We shouldn't resort to combat with the poor thing.

1330
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:04,140
He looks hungry.

1331
01:48:08,329 --> 01:48:18,680
You want to...

1332
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,079
What?

1333
01:48:19,079 --> 01:48:20,039
You're immune to rocks?

1334
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,539
Oh, I can't.

1335
01:48:33,539 --> 01:48:34,180
I can't.

1336
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,340
Alright, where's my creature?

1337
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:38,739
Let's go.

1338
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:44,069
Let's get you some food and then let's have you beat this guy up.

1339
01:48:45,029 --> 01:48:46,069
Matter of fact, let's just do it now.

1340
01:48:57,659 --> 01:48:58,859
He doesn't believe in you.

1341
01:49:03,619 --> 01:49:04,119
So?

1342
01:49:04,819 --> 01:49:10,939
Is this an evil playthrough?

1343
01:49:11,579 --> 01:49:12,460
I don't think this is evil.

1344
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:13,340
Wait, why can't I...

1345
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:14,539
The creature can't go this way?

1346
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,859
That's why the momma getting the X.

1347
01:49:26,789 --> 01:49:27,989
Look at how confident he is.

1348
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:36,220
Uh-oh, you've got a mighty rile.

1349
01:49:36,939 --> 01:49:38,779
Prepare for battle, boss.

1350
01:49:42,649 --> 01:49:44,010
He's not gonna kick the shit out of me, right?

1351
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:53,319
Uh...

1352
01:49:53,319 --> 01:50:02,600
Oh, fuck.

1353
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:03,479
Come on, come on.

1354
01:50:03,479 --> 01:50:04,199
Kick him.

1355
01:50:04,199 --> 01:50:05,159
Kick him.

1356
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:06,279
Do a move.

1357
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,859
Alright, nice, nice, nice.

1358
01:50:09,859 --> 01:50:11,060
Okay, I can do this.

1359
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:11,380
Block.

1360
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:25,770
Again.

1361
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:26,409
Offense again.

1362
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:28,949
Block, block, block, block, block.

1363
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:30,949
Block, block, block, block, block, block.

1364
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:35,899
Nice, good.

1365
01:50:37,819 --> 01:50:40,979
Shit.

1366
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:47,449
And dodge.

1367
01:50:56,649 --> 01:50:56,890
Again.

1368
01:50:57,529 --> 01:50:59,289
Oh, I queued up a big one too.

1369
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:02,390
Right in the face.

1370
01:51:05,989 --> 01:51:06,310
Oh!

1371
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:07,590
Block.

1372
01:51:08,229 --> 01:51:10,199
Lose.

1373
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:11,479
Come on.

1374
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:12,279
It's my fucking...

1375
01:51:12,279 --> 01:51:14,039
I'm going like off screen here.

1376
01:51:14,199 --> 01:51:14,520
Stop.

1377
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:20,579
Do I die?

1378
01:51:20,579 --> 01:51:21,060
Do you die?

1379
01:51:21,939 --> 01:51:27,720
I can't even get close to him.

1380
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:31,130
I can't even get fucking close to him.

1381
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:35,960
What the fuck was that?

1382
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:47,859
How do I run?

1383
01:51:47,859 --> 01:51:48,420
How do I run?

1384
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:49,939
How do I run away?

1385
01:51:57,369 --> 01:51:58,569
Hold on, leader.

1386
01:51:58,569 --> 01:52:02,250
Pull back from the fight and try again when we've recovered some strength.

1387
01:52:05,859 --> 01:52:07,060
I'm destroyed.

1388
01:52:10,569 --> 01:52:11,880
Jesus.

1389
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:15,380
Oh, no.

1390
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:19,289
He tried.

1391
01:52:27,189 --> 01:52:28,229
He was trying to be...

1392
01:52:28,949 --> 01:52:30,789
Oh, is he dead?

1393
01:52:30,789 --> 01:52:31,670
He's not dead, right?

1394
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:35,130
All right, you know, he's okay.

1395
01:52:37,859 --> 01:52:38,899
I actually just got scared.

1396
01:52:38,899 --> 01:52:40,579
Oh, he got the shit kicked at him.

1397
01:52:40,579 --> 01:52:41,460
All right, it's fine.

1398
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:52,069
He was standing there like, no, I'm good.

1399
01:52:52,069 --> 01:52:52,310
I'm good.

1400
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:52,630
Don't worry.

1401
01:52:52,630 --> 01:52:53,430
I'm fine.

1402
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:53,909
I'm fine.

1403
01:52:53,909 --> 01:52:54,310
I'm fine.

1404
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:57,510
Just instantly does like the Mortal Kombat.

1405
01:52:57,510 --> 01:53:00,550
You got kicked on the ground with zero health.

1406
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:02,710
Stood up and fell back down.

1407
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:09,510
That's what his eyes...

1408
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:11,430
Well, this is not good.

1409
01:53:12,229 --> 01:53:14,329
All right, come here.

1410
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:14,569
Let me...

1411
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:16,409
No, Jesus Christ.

1412
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:18,569
Don't get up.

1413
01:53:18,569 --> 01:53:18,810
Lay down.

1414
01:53:18,810 --> 01:53:19,449
Stay down.

1415
01:53:19,449 --> 01:53:19,770
Stay down.

1416
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:20,890
Stay down.

1417
01:53:20,890 --> 01:53:21,720
Stay down.

1418
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,119
Stay down.

1419
01:53:22,119 --> 01:53:22,520
Lie down.

1420
01:53:26,039 --> 01:53:29,380
You tried.

1421
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:30,100
You really did.

1422
01:53:32,359 --> 01:53:33,720
Just hang out over here for a minute.

1423
01:53:34,279 --> 01:53:36,100
Let me get you some food.

1424
01:53:38,949 --> 01:53:43,189
There's a silver reward scroll on the beach behind those huge gates.

1425
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:44,869
Okay, here.

1426
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:47,659
Have something to eat.

1427
01:53:48,539 --> 01:53:49,909
You look like...

1428
01:53:49,909 --> 01:53:50,710
You look skinny.

1429
01:53:50,710 --> 01:53:51,210
Here.

1430
01:53:52,149 --> 01:53:57,460
I don't like it.

1431
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:58,739
He has a taste for meat now.

1432
01:54:02,439 --> 01:54:03,159
I actually do...

1433
01:54:03,159 --> 01:54:04,680
I don't want you going fucking anywhere.

1434
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:05,180
Stay here.

1435
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:08,779
Stay here.

1436
01:54:08,779 --> 01:54:09,979
How do I like attach you to...

1437
01:54:09,979 --> 01:54:10,779
All right, stay here.

1438
01:54:11,739 --> 01:54:12,619
You need to heal.

1439
01:54:12,619 --> 01:54:13,119
Rest up.

1440
01:54:13,819 --> 01:54:16,119
All right, beach.

1441
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:23,449
Where was that scroll?

1442
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:25,930
On the beach somewhere.

1443
01:54:26,649 --> 01:54:29,479
Now there's this one.

1444
01:54:29,479 --> 01:54:30,199
I remember that one.

1445
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:32,649
What beach was it on?

1446
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:39,369
All right, let's do this one.

1447
01:54:39,930 --> 01:54:46,409
This notion that we quite like to sail the ocean

1448
01:54:46,409 --> 01:54:50,729
So we're building a big boat to leave here for good

1449
01:54:51,529 --> 01:54:53,369
We're not keen on sinking

1450
01:54:53,369 --> 01:54:55,689
So we're all sitting here and thinking

1451
01:54:55,689 --> 01:54:57,770
Cause we built it too big

1452
01:54:57,770 --> 01:55:00,810
And we've run out of wood

1453
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:02,920
I leave

1454
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:09,300
We simply can't leave till we get some more wood

1455
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:13,079
Not keen on sinking

1456
01:55:13,079 --> 01:55:15,399
So that's why we're sitting thinking

1457
01:55:15,399 --> 01:55:20,359
Cause we simply can't leave till we get some more wood

1458
01:55:20,359 --> 01:55:21,239
You're looking for a prayer?

1459
01:55:21,239 --> 01:55:23,319
You're looking for me to supply wood?

1460
01:55:23,319 --> 01:55:24,520
How dare they leave?

1461
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,920
After all we've done for them

1462
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,239
What have we done for them exactly?

1463
01:55:29,239 --> 01:55:31,079
Perhaps we should help them out.

1464
01:55:31,079 --> 01:55:32,119
It might be nice.

1465
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,279
How much wood do they need?

1466
01:55:37,159 --> 01:55:40,140
What does it say?

1467
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:41,859
The ark.

1468
01:55:42,579 --> 01:55:45,619
Oh, no, no, no.

1469
01:55:45,619 --> 01:55:46,340
I don't want to do this again.

1470
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:49,300
This notion that we quite like to sail the ocean

1471
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:49,380
So we're building a big boat to leave here for good

1472
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:50,100
I can't skip it again.

1473
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:51,060
So we're building a big boat to leave here for good

1474
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:51,859
I can't skip it again.

1475
01:55:51,859 --> 01:55:54,579
So we're building a big boat to leave here for good

1476
01:55:54,579 --> 01:55:56,420
We're not keen on sinking

1477
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:58,739
So we're all sitting here and thinking

1478
01:55:58,739 --> 01:56:00,899
Cause we built it too big

1479
01:56:00,899 --> 01:56:03,380
And we've run out of wood

1480
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:06,180
I leave

1481
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:08,180
I leave

1482
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:12,420
We simply can't leave till we get some more wood

1483
01:56:13,539 --> 01:56:16,180
Not keen on sinking

1484
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:18,500
So that's why we're sitting thinking

1485
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:21,859
Cause we simply can't leave till we get some more wood

1486
01:56:22,899 --> 01:56:26,739
Oh, you're not gonna leave me hanging

1487
01:56:26,739 --> 01:56:27,539
We're gonna do another verse

1488
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:39,880
We need wood

1489
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:40,920
How much wood?

1490
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:43,510
I wish it would tell me

1491
01:56:44,149 --> 01:56:45,140
Let's go get some

1492
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:45,939
Let's do it

1493
01:56:45,939 --> 01:56:46,659
I'll do it

1494
01:56:46,659 --> 01:56:48,020
I could smash up this thing right now

1495
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:49,460
But I know you're looking at me

1496
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:50,340
I know

1497
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:51,220
I'm just gonna take wood

1498
01:56:51,779 --> 01:56:52,180
Let's go

1499
01:56:52,819 --> 01:56:54,659
How much wood do I have over here?

1500
01:56:54,659 --> 01:56:55,619
An absolute shitload

1501
01:56:55,619 --> 01:56:56,180
Like too much

1502
01:56:59,289 --> 01:57:00,250
Let's get like 5,000

1503
01:57:00,970 --> 01:57:10,180
What are they doing over here?

1504
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:12,220
Are they praying?

1505
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:14,300
What the fuck was that?

1506
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:14,800
Hey!

1507
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:25,100
What?

1508
01:57:25,949 --> 01:57:27,949
Did he kick that from all the way?

1509
01:57:28,909 --> 01:57:29,710
What did you do?

1510
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:34,569
Why is the leash not working?

1511
01:57:34,569 --> 01:57:36,569
Hey, you're supposed to be stuck in there

1512
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:42,510
Why is the leash not working?

1513
01:57:42,510 --> 01:57:43,390
What is going on?

1514
01:57:49,239 --> 01:57:50,439
Get over here

1515
01:57:50,439 --> 01:57:51,319
Wait a minute

1516
01:57:51,319 --> 01:57:52,920
What the fuck is going on here?

1517
01:57:55,149 --> 01:57:55,869
Get over here

1518
01:57:55,869 --> 01:57:56,750
You're in big trouble

1519
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,479
You are actually in big trouble

1520
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:01,039
Get over here

1521
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:06,270
He did it

1522
01:58:06,989 --> 01:58:12,170
I'm gonna make a FIFA reference here

1523
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:16,380
Because that's the only way I can make this reference

1524
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:20,409
He just grabbed the ball as the goalie

1525
01:58:21,130 --> 01:58:23,770
And did a full power kick across the whole game

1526
01:58:24,409 --> 01:58:26,890
And for some reason you fucked up as the other goalie

1527
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:28,010
Like you are on the other team

1528
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:30,250
And they scored from the other side

1529
01:58:31,130 --> 01:58:32,010
That was ridiculous

1530
01:58:32,890 --> 01:58:40,829
Get over here

1531
01:58:40,829 --> 01:58:41,949
I need to be like putting

1532
01:58:41,949 --> 01:58:43,229
You want a boulder or something?

1533
01:58:46,729 --> 01:58:47,770
You can't kick that out, right?

1534
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:55,340
I played like FIFA maybe once

1535
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:56,539
But that's what it reminded me of

1536
01:58:57,659 --> 01:59:03,520
Punish him

1537
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:06,750
It's been too long

1538
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:07,470
I can't punish him

1539
01:59:07,470 --> 01:59:08,670
It's been too long

1540
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:08,909
All right

1541
01:59:08,909 --> 01:59:09,550
I'm just gonna like

1542
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:10,350
I'm gonna like just

1543
01:59:13,399 --> 01:59:14,039
Don't do that

1544
01:59:15,159 --> 01:59:23,630
Yeah, he can't get out

1545
01:59:24,829 --> 01:59:27,979
He just fucking like threw

1546
01:59:27,979 --> 01:59:29,180
Imagine if that was a rock

1547
01:59:29,819 --> 01:59:31,739
Imagine if he had access to a rock

1548
01:59:32,939 --> 01:59:34,460
That would have been catastrophic

1549
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:38,840
Where's this stupid boat?

1550
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:44,010
Look what I got

1551
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:45,130
Wood

1552
01:59:45,770 --> 01:59:49,560
Look at that

1553
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:51,479
Thank you for

1554
01:59:52,279 --> 01:59:59,529
Three guys, huh?

1555
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:09,130
Now destroy the ship?

1556
02:00:09,689 --> 02:00:10,090
No

1557
02:00:41,210 --> 02:00:44,890
I couldn't read that

1558
02:00:56,250 --> 02:01:04,399
I'm not doing that again, by the way

1559
02:01:04,399 --> 02:01:06,159
I refused to sing another one of those

1560
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:09,600
Like lazy singing is what I was doing

1561
02:01:11,319 --> 02:01:12,119
That kind of worked too

1562
02:01:12,119 --> 02:01:12,359
All right

1563
02:01:12,359 --> 02:01:13,479
Let's grain fine

1564
02:01:13,479 --> 02:01:13,720
Go

1565
02:01:29,159 --> 02:01:30,119
He's pissed

1566
02:01:38,010 --> 02:01:38,729
Well, don't just

1567
02:01:39,930 --> 02:01:42,649
Soccer kick balls into people that are praying

1568
02:01:44,439 --> 02:01:46,600
That's incredibly mean

1569
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:52,960
Here

1570
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:53,840
I'm putting this back

1571
02:01:54,479 --> 02:02:01,689
Oh, that's right

1572
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:02,170
Ball

1573
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:02,729
Yes, it is

1574
02:02:04,060 --> 02:02:04,939
Don't do that again

1575
02:02:05,659 --> 02:02:11,630
Dude, I'm not even certain

1576
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:13,390
The leash does a fucking goddamn thing

1577
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:14,029
Like how can he

1578
02:02:14,029 --> 02:02:15,310
Well, why can he do this?

1579
02:02:16,350 --> 02:02:25,449
He's not gonna do it again

1580
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:44,319
This leash doesn't do anything

1581
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,399
How do I make the leash work?

1582
02:02:53,279 --> 02:02:57,069
You're gonna lose it

1583
02:02:58,199 --> 02:02:59,239
You're gonna lose it in the water

1584
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:03,720
Lock it with mouse, too

1585
02:03:04,439 --> 02:03:04,840
I mean

1586
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:06,600
Isn't it locked?

1587
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:07,479
It's locked to a tree

1588
02:03:07,479 --> 02:03:09,239
Like a hundred fucking miles behind him

1589
02:03:10,359 --> 02:03:12,119
Fish farms can provide food for your village

1590
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:13,800
A fisherman will deliver his catch to the village

1591
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:14,279
Oh, that's cool

1592
02:03:15,930 --> 02:03:16,890
Shorten the length of the

1593
02:03:17,689 --> 02:03:18,729
How do I shorten the length?

1594
02:03:20,090 --> 02:03:20,329
All right

1595
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:21,289
Stop

1596
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:26,600
Get up there

1597
02:03:27,399 --> 02:03:34,409
Just let him do what he wants

1598
02:03:34,409 --> 02:03:35,529
No, it's a problem

1599
02:03:36,489 --> 02:03:36,890
All right

1600
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:38,170
So if I attach it to here

1601
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:41,930
And then how do I shorten the leash?

1602
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:51,050
I have the leash here

1603
02:03:51,689 --> 02:03:53,369
So how do I shorten it now?

1604
02:03:53,369 --> 02:04:01,550
Okay

1605
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:07,100
Restrict the area in which a creature can move when he's on a leash

1606
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:08,699
First, attach the leash to an object

1607
02:04:08,699 --> 02:04:11,500
Then click the action button anywhere on the leash to pick it up

1608
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:15,180
Pull to stretch the leash to the length you want it to be

1609
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:17,180
Then click the action button on the ground

1610
02:04:17,899 --> 02:04:18,779
To set its length

1611
02:04:19,659 --> 02:04:36,170
Is that going to work?

1612
02:04:36,970 --> 02:04:40,399
No, it's not working

1613
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,340
I never understood this mechanic either

1614
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:51,310
I mean, I should be able just to stick it, right?

1615
02:04:51,310 --> 02:04:51,789
Like that?

1616
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:53,949
Because look, I'm just giving him slack

1617
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:56,460
Pull

1618
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:57,760
Pull

1619
02:05:00,590 --> 02:05:02,039
It's probably bugged

1620
02:05:03,210 --> 02:05:08,779
Well, pull it back into the building

1621
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:18,079
I don't know if that's doing anything

1622
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:19,600
Is it the scroll wheel?

1623
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:20,399
I don't think so

1624
02:05:20,399 --> 02:05:20,960
Wait, hold on

1625
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:21,439
Did that work?

1626
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:27,640
Maybe that did work

1627
02:05:33,689 --> 02:05:35,640
Maybe

1628
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:36,600
I'll check back later

1629
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,159
I think it worked

1630
02:05:38,829 --> 02:05:40,430
You have to like pull it into the

1631
02:05:41,149 --> 02:05:41,869
I think that worked

1632
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:43,850
Is he bigger?

1633
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:44,970
Maybe a little

1634
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:45,289
All right

1635
02:05:45,289 --> 02:05:46,569
I need to do a brain

1636
02:05:47,449 --> 02:05:59,390
Go get his ball

1637
02:06:00,109 --> 02:06:01,920
It didn't

1638
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:02,560
No, it didn't work

1639
02:06:08,409 --> 02:06:10,170
Why can he just do this forever?

1640
02:06:17,069 --> 02:06:18,270
He wants the ball

1641
02:06:18,270 --> 02:06:19,229
All right, whatever

1642
02:06:19,949 --> 02:06:24,189
I gotta put this wood back

1643
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:32,000
He's hungry

1644
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,319
Stop kicking this shit

1645
02:06:38,029 --> 02:06:38,350
Stop

1646
02:06:39,149 --> 02:06:43,880
Go back up here

1647
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:51,279
Dude, your leash is too long

1648
02:06:52,079 --> 02:06:55,159
Fix the screen?

1649
02:06:55,159 --> 02:06:56,359
What are you talking about?

1650
02:06:56,359 --> 02:07:03,880
Just reapply the leash

1651
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:04,840
Here

1652
02:07:06,279 --> 02:07:11,920
Leash is on

1653
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:15,760
Leash is on

1654
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:19,479
Maybe choose a tree

1655
02:07:20,199 --> 02:07:21,640
No, he ran all the way over

1656
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:22,600
Whatever, he'll be fine

1657
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:23,479
Use a regular leash

1658
02:07:23,479 --> 02:07:23,880
Isn't this a

1659
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:25,560
This is a regular leash

1660
02:07:26,119 --> 02:07:26,840
This is like the

1661
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:27,960
Your

1662
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:30,199
This is the neutral one, right?

1663
02:07:31,159 --> 02:07:32,090
All right

1664
02:07:32,090 --> 02:07:32,489
Let me keep

1665
02:07:32,489 --> 02:07:33,930
Let me go do the grains thing

1666
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:36,670
How much do they need?

1667
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:37,789
I don't know

1668
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:43,079
2,000?

1669
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:45,579
4,000?

1670
02:07:45,579 --> 02:07:45,899
Let's do

1671
02:07:45,899 --> 02:07:47,020
We'll just do like 4,000

1672
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:50,300
A million grain

1673
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:51,340
Well, that would be ridiculous

1674
02:07:51,979 --> 02:07:53,949
All right

1675
02:07:53,949 --> 02:07:54,829
Where the hell is it though?

1676
02:07:55,390 --> 02:07:58,119
I keep losing shit

1677
02:08:10,170 --> 02:08:11,520
All right

1678
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:11,840
Here

1679
02:08:14,159 --> 02:08:16,399
We're grateful for the grain, holy one

1680
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:22,909
Another thing

1681
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:27,390
It's quite boring if that's all you eat

1682
02:08:27,390 --> 02:08:29,449
Need some flavor

1683
02:08:29,449 --> 02:08:31,850
So do us all a little favor

1684
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:34,170
Because we ain't going nowhere

1685
02:08:34,170 --> 02:08:36,329
Till we get some meat

1686
02:08:36,329 --> 02:08:38,090
Why don't you eat Bob over there?

1687
02:08:41,199 --> 02:08:41,920
Draw straws

1688
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:46,159
We can't leave until we got some meat

1689
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:49,199
So do us a favor

1690
02:08:49,199 --> 02:08:51,680
Find something with a little flavor

1691
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:53,920
Because we ain't going nowhere

1692
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:55,840
Till we got some meat

1693
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:56,560
Okay, found one

1694
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:04,960
Thanks for all this meat

1695
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,960
We need more meat though

1696
02:09:18,239 --> 02:09:19,520
Thanks for all this meat

1697
02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:27,560
Wait, how many people are gonna leave?

1698
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:32,239
Forget you, you know

1699
02:09:33,199 --> 02:09:34,399
See, what they don't know

1700
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:38,319
Is I'm doing that thing where I grab an arrow

1701
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:39,920
And try to burn it down

1702
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:41,199
It's like sending out a funeral

1703
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:58,939
I just hate goodbyes

1704
02:09:59,739 --> 02:10:01,579
I just hate good

1705
02:10:01,579 --> 02:10:03,789
I got something

1706
02:10:03,789 --> 02:10:04,189
What is it?

1707
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:08,840
This pedestal is a miracle dispenser

1708
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:13,000
It charges up and generates one-shot miracles

1709
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,319
Click on the signpost for more info

1710
02:10:15,319 --> 02:10:16,199
Is it rain?

1711
02:10:16,199 --> 02:10:16,600
Clouds?

1712
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:17,000
What is it?

1713
02:10:18,359 --> 02:10:20,569
A handful of water

1714
02:10:21,609 --> 02:10:23,930
There are miracles hidden all over Eden

1715
02:10:23,930 --> 02:10:24,890
Keep your eyes peeled

1716
02:10:25,689 --> 02:10:27,770
A miracle dispenser gives a one-shot miracle

1717
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:29,449
Wonders when it's fully charged

1718
02:10:29,449 --> 02:10:30,250
This is water

1719
02:10:38,359 --> 02:10:50,270
Okay, what's water?

1720
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:54,300
Is this my village?

1721
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:55,500
No, not yet

1722
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:57,689
Oh, they have a stone over there

1723
02:10:57,689 --> 02:10:58,250
What's that thing?

1724
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:59,770
All right, how about right over here?

1725
02:10:59,770 --> 02:11:05,310
Let's water the trees

1726
02:11:06,270 --> 02:11:06,829
Like over here

1727
02:11:18,779 --> 02:11:19,979
All right, nice

1728
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:23,500
What do you mean the cow?

1729
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:24,000
What?

1730
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:41,100
There's no point of you even having this leash on

1731
02:11:41,819 --> 02:11:48,170
There's just no point

1732
02:11:48,890 --> 02:11:50,810
Here, just you go do you

1733
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:56,750
Has he eaten anything without you looking?

1734
02:11:57,390 --> 02:11:57,789
I don't know

1735
02:11:58,590 --> 02:12:05,289
You have to restrict the length of the leash

1736
02:12:05,289 --> 02:12:06,810
Yeah, I tried to do that like five times

1737
02:12:08,189 --> 02:12:10,029
Just pull it and click the action

1738
02:12:10,029 --> 02:12:12,350
But it does it just I can't get it to do anything

1739
02:12:17,739 --> 02:12:19,579
Yeah, it legit just didn't work

1740
02:12:19,579 --> 02:12:20,460
It really didn't

1741
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:21,500
I kept undoing it

1742
02:12:22,939 --> 02:12:25,840
All right, I'm gonna do this one more time

1743
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:27,920
So we can be clear

1744
02:12:34,670 --> 02:12:36,270
Oh my god, that's a lot

1745
02:12:36,270 --> 02:12:37,550
What did you that's a lot of

1746
02:12:38,430 --> 02:12:42,119
All right, leash is on tree, right?

1747
02:12:42,119 --> 02:12:43,159
Okay, leash on tree

1748
02:12:50,119 --> 02:12:51,319
You hate this person

1749
02:12:52,039 --> 02:12:53,800
He comes up from points every time

1750
02:12:54,970 --> 02:12:56,170
All right, so no wrong

1751
02:12:57,050 --> 02:12:59,260
All right, so look

1752
02:13:00,649 --> 02:13:01,770
So grab the leash

1753
02:13:02,489 --> 02:13:04,729
I have the leash in my hand right now

1754
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:10,239
I can't do anything

1755
02:13:15,229 --> 02:13:19,119
I mean, you've moved it

1756
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:20,880
Don't do that

1757
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:27,819
Don't don't click

1758
02:13:27,819 --> 02:13:28,699
Well, I have to okay

1759
02:13:28,699 --> 02:13:30,939
I have to hold right click to hold this

1760
02:13:38,810 --> 02:13:41,210
Right click I have to hold right click, right?

1761
02:13:42,189 --> 02:13:43,710
If I let go of right click

1762
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:45,789
He just let you let it go

1763
02:13:46,430 --> 02:13:48,760
Like I can pull it

1764
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:49,800
But it doesn't seem to do anything

1765
02:13:50,439 --> 02:13:54,779
I mean scrolling just moves in and out

1766
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,520
And if I click you just let it go

1767
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:06,970
He's just gonna roam around or whatever

1768
02:14:10,239 --> 02:14:11,359
Or he can just do that

1769
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,760
And it doesn't even matter where the leash is

1770
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:22,520
He's pissed

1771
02:14:23,159 --> 02:14:24,439
This is what

1772
02:14:25,079 --> 02:14:25,399
Hold on

1773
02:14:25,399 --> 02:14:27,159
Did he just do like the fuck you?

1774
02:14:37,630 --> 02:14:38,989
Why do you hate this person?

1775
02:14:39,550 --> 02:14:41,789
I don't understand what his problem is

1776
02:14:44,350 --> 02:14:45,630
Just go relax

1777
02:14:45,630 --> 02:14:46,590
Go sleep somewhere

1778
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:48,890
I've got stuff to do

1779
02:14:53,369 --> 02:14:54,170
You are he's coming

1780
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:54,649
He's coming back

1781
02:14:54,649 --> 02:14:55,770
All right, all right, right, right, right

1782
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:00,510
The temple is like clicking right now

1783
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:05,760
Why is the temple doing this?

1784
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:08,750
Oh creature creature room

1785
02:15:12,319 --> 02:15:13,520
The creature cave

1786
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:18,409
The screws display different attributes about your creature

1787
02:15:20,489 --> 02:15:21,130
Oh, that's cool

1788
02:15:22,090 --> 02:15:26,090

02:15:27,739 --> 02:15:29,420

What's going on?

1792
02:15:31,899 --> 02:15:34,810
I'm playing black and white

1793
02:15:34,810 --> 02:15:36,090
An old pc game

1794
02:15:37,130 --> 02:15:38,329
Thanks lime malicious

1795
02:15:38,329 --> 02:15:39,130

Lines pog

1798
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:50,859
Miracle

1799
02:15:50,859 --> 02:15:53,899
This shows the miracles our crew chicken cast

1800
02:15:53,979 --> 02:15:54,779
Okay, not yet

1801
02:15:54,779 --> 02:15:56,779
Wow half a creek in time

1802
02:15:58,060 --> 02:16:00,140
All right

1803
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:01,180
So he doesn't know how to do anything

1804
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:01,979
Creature mind

1805
02:16:01,979 --> 02:16:04,619
This girl shows our creature's state of mind

1806
02:16:05,979 --> 02:16:07,819
His likes and dislikes

1807
02:16:09,899 --> 02:16:11,420
I am slightly greedy

1808
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:13,100
I'm extremely tired

1809
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:14,779
I'm very compassionate

1810
02:16:14,779 --> 02:16:16,380
I'm extremely frightened

1811
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:17,420
I'm rather playful

1812
02:16:18,380 --> 02:16:20,060
I think my god is on the side of good

1813
02:16:20,699 --> 02:16:22,699
My deity has paid me quite a lot of attention

1814
02:16:23,739 --> 02:16:24,939
What do I think about the creature guy?

1815
02:16:24,939 --> 02:16:26,060
He's on the side of good

1816
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:29,199
What do I think about creature slag?

1817
02:16:29,199 --> 02:16:30,319
He is black hearted

1818
02:16:33,799 --> 02:16:37,479
The creature god is the is the person that he ate by the way

1819
02:16:37,479 --> 02:16:41,709
I know about one temple

1820
02:16:41,709 --> 02:16:44,270
I know about two creatures who oh slag

1821
02:16:44,270 --> 02:16:45,629
Okay, we have to kick slags ass

1822
02:16:47,930 --> 02:16:51,290
More general information such as his age and height

1823
02:16:51,290 --> 02:16:52,170
This him

1824
02:16:52,170 --> 02:16:53,290
Wait, his name is god

1825
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:54,010
Hey boss

1826
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:58,010
You can change or add tattoos to the creature by clicking on him

1827
02:17:00,670 --> 02:17:01,309
On the side

1828
02:17:01,309 --> 02:17:03,309
All right, wait, how do I rename the character?

1829
02:17:06,190 --> 02:17:07,629
Amount of poop zero

1830
02:17:07,629 --> 02:17:08,989
People killed one

1831
02:17:10,030 --> 02:17:11,069
Animals killed eight

1832
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:14,059
Twelve poops

1833
02:17:14,059 --> 02:17:17,260
So he's only killed one person and it was the creature trainer

1834
02:17:21,079 --> 02:17:21,799
How do I rename?

1835
02:17:25,530 --> 02:17:27,770
This squirrel shows what he's learned to do

1836
02:17:29,239 --> 02:17:30,840
Phil is praying with evil

1837
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:37,129
Your creature has learned that he can take food from the field

1838
02:17:37,129 --> 02:17:37,629
Okay

1839
02:17:38,489 --> 02:17:41,209
Your creature doesn't know how to use the totem

1840
02:17:41,209 --> 02:17:42,409
Get him and watch you moving it

1841
02:17:42,409 --> 02:17:42,909
All right

1842
02:17:43,610 --> 02:17:45,370
Doesn't know how to use the village store

1843
02:17:45,370 --> 02:17:47,049
Get him to watch the villagers you

1844
02:17:47,049 --> 02:17:47,549
Okay

1845
02:17:47,770 --> 02:17:48,409
It's on the list

1846
02:17:49,209 --> 02:17:50,489
Your creature has learned how to fish

1847
02:17:50,489 --> 02:17:52,090
Your creature has learned how to dance

1848
02:17:53,209 --> 02:17:54,969
I haven't seen that

1849
02:17:56,170 --> 02:18:01,760
This creature is dumb

1850
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:02,479
Yeah, pretty dumb

1851
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:04,260
Pretty dumb

1852
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:05,920
Let's check this

1853
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:07,040
132 people living

1854
02:18:07,680 --> 02:18:08,959
96% believe

1855
02:18:10,569 --> 02:18:11,530
10 deaths

1856
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:12,569
67 births

1857
02:18:13,209 --> 02:18:15,629
Okay

1858
02:18:15,629 --> 02:18:16,430
We need some more

1859
02:18:16,430 --> 02:18:17,870
All right, I gotta make some more people

1860
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:23,520
All right, let's head out of here

1861
02:18:28,239 --> 02:18:28,739
There he is

1862
02:18:30,479 --> 02:18:31,440
What's with the heartbeat?

1863
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:33,360
The do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

1864
02:18:34,409 --> 02:18:35,690
Why what's why is it happening?

1865
02:18:36,329 --> 02:18:48,000
Didn't it say I can like do something to him?

1866
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:49,520
I can give him like tattoos

1867
02:18:57,850 --> 02:18:58,729
Give him some tattoos

1868
02:18:58,729 --> 02:18:58,969
I don't know

1869
02:18:58,969 --> 02:19:00,170
How do I do that?

1870
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:00,729
All right

1871
02:19:00,729 --> 02:19:01,229
Hold on

1872
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:04,620
I got other tasks that I have to complete

1873
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:06,139
So I can get some more miracles and shit

1874
02:19:06,139 --> 02:19:07,579
Because yeah like we got to

1875
02:19:08,379 --> 02:19:11,149
There are still sheep missing

1876
02:19:11,149 --> 02:19:17,899
What is this one?

1877
02:19:17,899 --> 02:19:18,780
Oh no

1878
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:20,780
Some of my poor children are lost

1879
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:21,819
They'll need rescuing

1880
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:26,459
A stranger has been seen putting the children into trances

1881
02:19:26,459 --> 02:19:27,579
Who the fuck is this guy?

1882
02:19:28,459 --> 02:19:30,940
He has them imprisoned in a secret place

1883
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:31,440
What?

1884
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:34,889
This stranger is to blame

1885
02:19:34,889 --> 02:19:36,010
It's got to be him

1886
02:19:36,569 --> 02:19:38,889
But if he should die before we find the children

1887
02:19:38,889 --> 02:19:40,489
They could be lost forever

1888
02:19:40,489 --> 02:19:41,770
Oh my babies

1889
02:19:44,729 --> 02:19:45,229
Let's go

1890
02:19:45,930 --> 02:19:46,729
We must act

1891
02:19:47,290 --> 02:19:48,729
Tiny lives are at stake

1892
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:50,889
Tiny lives?

1893
02:19:50,889 --> 02:19:52,809
Come on who cares?

1894
02:19:53,209 --> 02:19:55,770
I gotta get this heartbeat to turn off before I lose my mind

1895
02:19:58,090 --> 02:20:02,729
How do I shut this off?

1896
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:21,200
Is this something that it wants me to do in here?

1897
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:22,319
That I just to make it like a

1898
02:20:22,319 --> 02:20:23,280
Is that a notification?

1899
02:20:24,159 --> 02:20:29,770

02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:47,120
How do I get it to stop?

1934
02:22:48,620 --> 02:22:49,659
It won't stop

1935
02:22:50,299 --> 02:22:56,620
Where's the sheep guy?

Cave

1944
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:35,340
Not cave

1945
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:36,540
What I'm looking for

1946
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:37,180
Is this too

1947
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:37,680
What is this?

1948
02:23:43,959 --> 02:23:45,879
As I see it there ain't no need

1949
02:23:45,879 --> 02:23:47,799
For me to bow before you son

1950
02:23:47,799 --> 02:23:48,520
Going right through the water

1951
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:50,200

1952
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:52,280
Which infesses me what it a bit

1953
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:55,079
Gods have huge creatures

1954
02:23:55,079 --> 02:23:56,920
And that's what my mama always told me

1955
02:23:57,479 --> 02:24:00,040
And until I see a big enough one

1956
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:01,879
You don't mean nothing to me

1957
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:04,620
Okay

1958
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:06,459
I need to have a big creature

1959
02:24:06,459 --> 02:24:08,780
Oh don't leave him as a lost soul

1960
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:10,379
Show him your creature

1961
02:24:10,379 --> 02:24:12,700
Oh let him die alone

1962
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:13,899
It's what he wants

1963
02:24:13,899 --> 02:24:14,860
The hick

1964
02:24:14,860 --> 02:24:18,139
You don't have to justify yourself to him

1965
02:24:18,139 --> 02:24:19,020
Oh come on

1966
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:20,780
You've got better things to destroy

1967
02:24:22,139 --> 02:24:55,469
Believe me now?

1968
02:25:01,969 --> 02:25:05,659
Okay fine

1969
02:25:20,860 --> 02:25:24,620
You killed him you uncaring horrid mean god

1970
02:25:37,469 --> 02:25:43,200
Wait wait what?

1971
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:44,879
Is he dead?

1972
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:59,059
But why can I touch it?

1973
02:25:59,059 --> 02:25:59,860
Why can I pick him up?

1974
02:26:06,590 --> 02:26:08,030
Where was that?

1975
02:26:08,030 --> 02:26:08,829
Where was that?

1976
02:26:08,829 --> 02:26:10,190

02:26:56,209 --> 02:26:56,709
Person

1987
02:26:57,329 --> 02:26:58,850
I'm taking myself completely out of this one

He notices

1991
02:27:16,350 --> 02:27:17,420
He's like where's dad?

02:27:18,059 --> 02:27:20,190
Where's dad?

1993
02:27:21,149 --> 02:27:22,270

No no no

Hey

2248
02:45:30,659 --> 02:45:40,190
He didn't like that do you learn that because I if he's leashed

2249
02:45:40,190 --> 02:45:44,190
So for instance I got a leash on him I can't pick up a spell while he's leashed

2250
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:54,909
Oh there we go you have to link that okay come here come over here

02:46:49,409 --> 02:46:55,469
So I can restart the game here just I'll take a sheep from here and put it over here

2257
02:46:56,110 --> 02:47:18,879
Doesn't matter how many does he need is it not count still looking for sheep

2258
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:31,340
This is still the tutorial world I mean from my understanding and you just do this for like a few

2259
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:40,860
Hours and then you go to like the next level in quotes like level two so I mean it it is tutorial

2260
02:47:40,860 --> 02:47:49,809
Zone but it is like chapter one so all right can I be done with this now or does he did I

2261
02:47:49,809 --> 02:48:13,120

It's over. I don't care. It's over. Whatever. I'll

2424
03:09:29,629 --> 03:09:31,920
Where is he?

2425
03:09:31,920 --> 03:09:38,059
Any more people I can throw in there?

2426
03:09:38,959 --> 03:09:40,719
No, everyone's dead

2427
03:09:40,719 --> 03:09:47,409
I don't know where the ball is

2428
03:09:47,409 --> 03:09:49,840
I see the ball. No, you don't

2429
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:51,840
He kicked it down here

2430
03:09:51,840 --> 03:09:53,600
a long time ago

2431
03:09:53,600 --> 03:09:56,479
Like down this way

2432
03:09:56,479 --> 03:10:00,260
What about the aztec village?

2433
03:10:07,739 --> 03:10:09,260
These people are fine

2434
03:10:09,260 --> 03:10:26,610
Look at all this wood for free

2435
03:10:30,829 --> 03:10:32,909
He kicked it around the shore around the portal

2436
03:10:33,629 --> 03:10:35,629
Well, we'll get one more good look at it

2437
03:10:43,440 --> 03:10:45,920
They worked hard for that. Yeah, they worked hard for that for me

2438
03:10:46,639 --> 03:10:59,969
That's how this works

2439
03:10:59,969 --> 03:11:01,569
What do you mean ego?

2440
03:11:01,569 --> 03:11:03,329
I am an all-powerful

2441
03:11:03,329 --> 03:11:05,329
God that can do anything

2442
03:11:09,059 --> 03:11:11,059
I required 20 000 wood

2443
03:11:11,620 --> 03:11:13,620
And I got it. All right, it's time to go

2444
03:11:15,569 --> 03:11:22,000
Let's go

2445
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,399
Ball right there. I did not miss the ball

2446
03:11:26,750 --> 03:11:28,430
Wait, should I take the fence?

2447
03:11:28,430 --> 03:11:32,750
Sure. Why not?

2448
03:11:32,750 --> 03:12:06,110
I'm done. Wait, is this this is the stuff that I brought?

2449
03:12:12,260 --> 03:12:17,620
Okay, I feel all inside. I got like 10 people a fence. Yeah, what a butt

2450
03:12:18,340 --> 03:12:20,340
Look someone's approaching

2451
03:12:20,819 --> 03:12:24,399
Someone

2452
03:12:24,399 --> 03:12:27,920
I greet you as one god to another. I am kazaa

2453
03:12:28,799 --> 03:12:35,440
It was I who provided the vortex to save you from nemesis. I declare war come with me

2454
03:12:36,239 --> 03:12:39,360
I need your help in return. I will help you

2455
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:52,959
What do you need?

2456
03:12:52,959 --> 03:13:00,639
My very existence is threatened by lethis another god from the snowy realm and an ally of nemesis

2457
03:13:00,639 --> 03:13:04,879
This could be a lie, but you and I together can turn the tide of this war

2458
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:07,600
There is much to do though

2459
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:11,040
Firstly, you need to build up a village and look after your worshipers

2460
03:13:11,840 --> 03:13:16,959
I'll take you back to your village and place down scaffolds for you from my village's workshop

2461
03:13:17,520 --> 03:13:20,750
Okay

2462
03:13:20,750 --> 03:13:25,469
These create blueprints which indicate to your people what to build and where you want it

2463
03:13:26,829 --> 03:13:36,819
He's what a god, but he has to scroll wheel all the way over here. He can't just teleport it

2464
03:13:39,260 --> 03:13:41,659
He has to hold his mouse all the way to the edge of the screen

2465
03:13:47,149 --> 03:13:52,129
I will give you my finest builder. This is a disciple who works single-mindedly

2466
03:13:52,270 --> 03:13:58,510
I don't eat you can create your own disciples by placing people at the locations of the jobs you wish them to do

2467
03:14:05,920 --> 03:14:09,600
Here is some food wood and water for your tribe to help you start

2468
03:14:10,159 --> 03:14:13,840
I must leave to defend my realm, but I shall return when I can

2469
03:14:14,879 --> 03:14:18,879
With the coolest creature in the game the funny gorilla wait

2470
03:14:19,440 --> 03:14:20,719
You didn't

2471
03:14:20,719 --> 03:14:22,719
You didn't pick the funny gorilla

2472
03:14:23,389 --> 03:14:25,389
Oh, wow, that's that was a mistake

2473
03:14:25,950 --> 03:14:33,379
Kazaa has provided us with so much. He's a true ally. He's desperate still on the cow, huh?

2474
03:14:33,459 --> 03:14:38,020
Let's get our village built. Yeah, and we gotta get the disciples working there

2475
03:14:41,010 --> 03:14:43,569
All right, so we gotta get some stuff going here

2476
03:14:44,739 --> 03:14:49,540
Oh, I had the heel miracle. It did come with me. Wait, he's throwing shit over here. Wait, what is he doing?

2477
03:14:49,620 --> 03:14:53,739

Everybody make your way down here

He's doing it again

2653
03:30:20,809 --> 03:30:25,690
Slapping or stroking the creature determines whether he can and can't do something. Yeah, that's good. Keep at it

2654
03:30:26,649 --> 03:30:28,889

All right, well get some sleep he's tired all right, well here go to bed

03:31:41,879 --> 03:31:50,329
Go go in your bed. Is this done? Oh shit. This is done. All right. What do I do about this?

2669
03:31:54,680 --> 03:31:59,399
Your worship site is built now. Let me teach you how to create miracles

2670
03:32:00,120 --> 03:32:06,440
Your people will worship you at the temple to send them there. You must raise the totem at the village center

2671
03:32:07,079 --> 03:32:09,479
You move the hand over the totem

2672
03:32:11,319 --> 03:32:15,319
Then you hold down the action button to grab the totem

2673
03:32:16,040 --> 03:32:20,600
You move the hand up and down to raise and lower the totem

2674
03:32:21,559 --> 03:32:26,280
I've raised the totem. So your this is come worshiping to the worship site

2675
03:32:27,850 --> 03:32:34,649
The higher you raise the totem the more people from your village will go to worship you this is emergency prayer

2676
03:32:34,649 --> 03:32:36,649
Look at your followers

2677
03:32:45,340 --> 03:32:49,659
Okay, they are dancing worshiping you this gives you power

2678
03:32:51,420 --> 03:32:52,459
All right

2679
03:32:52,459 --> 03:32:59,440
It's a rave

2680
03:32:59,440 --> 03:33:04,989
So what every single person in town comes here? All right

2681
03:33:04,989 --> 03:33:07,389
Then look, this is gonna be a we're just gonna make a bunch of people braiders

2682
03:33:07,389 --> 03:33:09,790
These are the miracles that your people offer you

2683
03:33:10,510 --> 03:33:13,549
the miracles of grain wood and water and water

2684
03:33:14,350 --> 03:33:19,870
To activate one grab the miracle with the action button and it will be charged by your worship it

2685
03:33:20,510 --> 03:33:23,790
You'll see the energy rings flowing into your hand

2686
03:33:25,850 --> 03:33:30,809
When the miracle is charged it appears in your hand and you are ready to cast the miracle

2687
03:33:31,770 --> 03:33:38,409
Remember worshiping comes at a cost the needs of your worshipers can be seen on these flags

2688
03:33:39,049 --> 03:33:44,250
So it's good to satisfy these needs and keep your villagers in good health

2689
03:33:49,639 --> 03:33:55,799
I'll leave you now to experiment with miracles and expand your influence by growing your village

2690
03:33:56,040 --> 03:33:58,200
So you just have to have grain to stick it outside here

2691
03:33:59,479 --> 03:34:06,139
Uh, that's a lot of they just took it all

2692
03:34:06,219 --> 03:34:14,799
All food desire 100 each tribe has its own worship site constructed by village of the race

2693
03:34:16,139 --> 03:34:18,139
each village has

2694
03:34:18,139 --> 03:34:21,340
Miracles at its village center, which also can be its worship site

2695
03:34:21,899 --> 03:34:25,500
Worshippers need food and rest which can be seen on the needs flag

2696
03:34:26,379 --> 03:34:30,459
Worshippers will swap with less tired worshipers from the village if they're available

2697
03:34:31,659 --> 03:34:34,620
You must use the action button to activate a miracle for charging

2698
03:34:36,159 --> 03:34:37,920
Yeah, okay

2699
03:34:39,319 --> 03:34:46,600
Did he just shrink he just shrunk uh worshipers can die chanting

2700
03:34:48,600 --> 03:34:55,239
In the middle of worship site is a chant store if no miracles are charging the worshipers will chant into the chant store for later use

2701
03:34:56,649 --> 03:35:01,770
One-shot miracles may be added to the chant store. You can also give your charged miracle energy to other gods

2702
03:35:05,129 --> 03:35:07,690
All right. Well, I don't want them to to dance to death

2703
03:35:09,760 --> 03:35:14,799
If you make your worship site look more interesting than you'll get more power trees rocks and placing mushrooms. Okay

Oops. Well now I don't know ever wait, maybe I can maybe I can he could where is he?

2758
03:39:57,440 --> 03:40:01,620
Come here

2759
03:40:01,620 --> 03:40:03,620
21 he just said he started to learn

2760
03:40:07,639 --> 03:40:12,120
That upset him

2761
03:40:12,120 --> 03:40:14,120
And it gave him gas. Okay

2762
03:40:18,700 --> 03:40:23,209
You can tap on a you can tap on a miracle seat to break it this place is in your hand. Yeah

2763
03:40:25,680 --> 03:40:26,719
to burst

2764
03:40:26,719 --> 03:40:30,879
To burst the bubble of a one-shot miracle will you quit your attached leash to the miracle itself? Really?

2765
03:40:31,680 --> 03:40:34,479
Right. Well, come here. Let's try that. There's more stuff to do over here

2766
03:40:36,969 --> 03:40:39,229
By combining up to seven scaffolds

2767
03:40:40,780 --> 03:40:43,979
You can create the following structures. One is a small house

2768
03:40:44,940 --> 03:40:47,260
Two is a big house. Three is a civic building

2769
03:40:48,350 --> 03:40:50,590
Four is field five is a village center

2770
03:40:52,270 --> 03:40:54,829
soccer a six scaffolds at the soccer field

2771
03:40:57,239 --> 03:41:01,000
All right, how do I get how to make it how to make a scaffold i'm sure it's about to tell me

2772
03:41:01,879 --> 03:41:05,149
But wait you come here

2773
03:41:06,430 --> 03:41:17,709
Come here, I want you to do this. I want him to uh to open up this thing

2774
03:41:19,790 --> 03:41:22,590
All right, see all right, he knows it's on there now

2775
03:41:23,870 --> 03:41:28,219
30. All right. He's learning it. Maybe he can figure it out

2776
03:41:30,440 --> 03:41:34,239
Here's the food miracle

2777
03:41:34,239 --> 03:41:36,799
Look watch what I can do

2778
03:41:36,879 --> 03:41:37,920
Not cool

2779
03:41:37,920 --> 03:41:42,729
Oh and you can eat it. Well, don't stand in it. You can eat it

2780
03:41:46,159 --> 03:41:47,389
look

2781
03:41:47,389 --> 03:41:48,860
rain

2782
03:41:48,860 --> 03:41:50,860
That's time. I'll pick it up. Whatever. Fuck it

2783
03:41:51,020 --> 03:41:55,819
Okay, let's uh, let's figure this out

2784
03:42:00,200 --> 03:42:03,239
Kazaa sent me I can help you build your settlement up

2785
03:42:08,479 --> 03:42:09,440
right

2786
03:42:09,440 --> 03:42:12,719
People are sleeping outdoors as they don't have enough buildings to live in

2787
03:42:16,840 --> 03:42:19,159
This is the workshop. I make scaffolding here

2788
03:42:19,559 --> 03:42:24,920
It allows you to decide where new buildings should be constructed. All right, let's go you can supply me with enough wood

2789
03:42:25,239 --> 03:42:27,239
I can build a scaffold

2790
03:42:27,479 --> 03:42:29,450
more houses

2791
03:42:29,450 --> 03:42:31,450
Feed he's not no, I need this person

2792
03:42:33,680 --> 03:42:35,680
So you get scaffolds you can do I get it

2793
03:42:36,399 --> 03:42:40,239
How much wood do you need?

2794
03:42:40,239 --> 03:42:42,959
Oh man in the workshop wants some wood

2795
03:42:43,920 --> 03:42:45,450
Okay

2796
03:42:45,450 --> 03:42:47,450
I can do that

2797
03:42:47,450 --> 03:42:49,450
How much like five grand ten grand

2798
03:42:51,040 --> 03:42:52,799
Well, i'll give you ten thousand

2799
03:42:52,799 --> 03:42:54,799
No, let's do five dollars

2800
03:42:56,270 --> 03:42:58,270
Don't make the soccer field it's bugged

2801
03:42:58,670 --> 03:43:01,229
I think there's an actual patch to do that right here

2802
03:43:02,190 --> 03:43:04,190
Look, there's a lot of

2803
03:43:05,549 --> 03:43:09,559
All right

2804
03:43:09,559 --> 03:43:11,559
How did I get this game?

2805
03:43:12,200 --> 03:43:13,799
I bought it

2806
03:43:13,799 --> 03:43:15,530
and then

2807
03:43:15,530 --> 03:43:17,290
I installed it

2808
03:43:17,290 --> 03:43:20,649
And then I had to do a bunch of tweaks to get it to work on windows 10

2809
03:43:21,129 --> 03:43:25,209
Because if you don't know this game had some of the shittiest drm ever made

2810
03:43:25,930 --> 03:43:29,229
Give me a little point where turn the wood into scaffolds

2811
03:43:29,450 --> 03:43:33,770
Uh went like windows actually removed the ability to use the drm

2812
03:43:34,409 --> 03:43:36,409
Because it's such a vulnerable piece of shit

2813
03:43:37,049 --> 03:43:39,389
so

2814
03:43:39,389 --> 03:43:41,629
You have to like essentially

2815
03:43:42,270 --> 03:43:44,270
You have to either disable

2816
03:43:44,670 --> 03:43:48,190
a feature in windows and put your computer at risk

2817
03:43:48,670 --> 03:43:52,190
Or you have to go around the drm is the only possible way you can play

2818
03:43:54,190 --> 03:44:00,270
It looks like your scaffolding is ready. We just need to move it to an area where we want it built

2819
03:44:00,350 --> 03:44:04,719
That's a lot of wood to place a scaffold down on the ground. All right, let's get it

2820
03:44:05,600 --> 03:44:07,600
Scaffold value one

2821
03:44:08,159 --> 03:44:14,079
When you're happy with its location and angle click the action button. All right, let's make like let's let's not be stupid about this

2822
03:44:14,399 --> 03:44:17,399
How about um

2823
03:44:17,399 --> 03:44:19,399
Down here. Yeah, this looks all right

2824
03:44:20,329 --> 03:44:21,770
right here

2825
03:44:21,770 --> 03:44:26,409
Oh, this is such a worthwhile cause planning homes to be built for the homeless

2826
03:44:26,649 --> 03:44:31,290
There is another way to solve this homeless problem. Oh, yes. Yeah

2827
03:44:31,850 --> 03:44:33,049
Kill him

2828
03:44:33,049 --> 03:44:36,760
These two guys are fucking wild

2829
03:44:37,399 --> 03:44:39,799
You're gonna do some more miracles you're gonna practice your water

2830
03:44:40,760 --> 03:44:43,049
Practice your water

2831
03:44:43,049 --> 03:44:48,989
I know you can do it. You need more buildings. You just scared him. Thanks a lot dickhead

All right, let's do um still homeless people in the village. All right, let's do more houses more wood houses

2833
03:44:55,629 --> 03:44:57,629
Oh fuck. I need a lot more wood

03:44:57,709 --> 03:44:59,870
All right. I gotta make people do tree cutting

2835

2845
03:46:02,379 --> 03:46:03,899
Two is a bigger house

2846
03:46:03,899 --> 03:46:07,020
Yeah, that's what i'm talking about. Let's put this one right over here right next to this one

2847
03:46:07,739 --> 03:46:19,309
What just happened? That's not what I want

2848
03:46:25,229 --> 03:46:28,430
There we go. Okay. All right build it

Raising and lowering the village end of turnip is used to get into the worship. Yeah, we know that already

2850
03:46:36,190 --> 03:46:43,389
There are still homeless people in the village. You need to build more houses rotating automatically. Yeah, that that actually is

2851
03:46:44,110 --> 03:46:44,989

Constant worship is needed to maintain it, but the wood it provides is a blessing to the people

04:08:12,920 --> 04:08:19,000
Didn't I already have this?

3034

04:09:55,819 --> 04:09:59,469
Oh i'm not in one of these again

3054
04:10:03,280 --> 04:10:08,000
The stones hold the spirits of the ancients each has its own voice

3055
04:10:10,680 --> 04:10:15,399
It is said that when a correct tune is played special powers are unleashed

3056
04:10:15,879 --> 04:10:19,319
When the stones are tapped the spirit sings

3057
04:10:20,120 --> 04:10:25,959
Few people know the melodies you may meet them or discover the melodies for yourself

3058
04:10:27,639 --> 04:10:33,069
Okay lightning

3059
04:10:36,250 --> 04:10:38,250

Let's wait. I need uh grain. You said put it in the thing

3070
04:11:55,739 --> 04:12:01,819

3071
04:12:02,700 --> 04:12:06,540
So and you lose like a tiny amount of the bottom of the screen

3072
04:12:07,260 --> 04:12:14,170
Sorry about that

3073
04:12:14,170 --> 04:12:18,489

3101
04:16:37,600 --> 04:16:38,799

04:16:38,799 --> 04:16:42,879
Pull this down. Am I gonna act don't tell me i'm gonna actually throw this am I?

3103
04:16:43,600 --> 04:16:49,500
Can I pull this down?

3104
04:16:49,500 --> 04:17:06,559
All right. Come on

3105
04:17:06,559 --> 04:17:11,680
Imagine seeing that the gods like oh here comes. Oh, that's how you want to play, huh?

3106
04:17:12,809 --> 04:17:14,809
Oh, that was pathetic

3107
04:17:16,590 --> 04:17:18,270
You missed

3108
04:17:18,270 --> 04:17:23,040
All right, everybody go this he's chasing birds. All right, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop

3109
04:17:25,440 --> 04:17:37,600
People will die if I do this shit still I've got more forest. This is why they don't fire. Are they burning?

3110
04:17:39,709 --> 04:17:44,379
No, they aren't right

3111
04:17:45,420 --> 04:17:47,719
There's another thing to do over here

3112
04:17:50,000 --> 04:17:53,680
Soon you will need to protect your villages and their buildings

3113
04:17:54,399 --> 04:17:59,680
The physical shield protects against objects which are not of a spiritual nature

3114
04:18:00,319 --> 04:18:04,079
When you have the miracle, this is how you cast a shield

3115
04:18:04,319 --> 04:18:06,840
The shield

3116
04:18:06,840 --> 04:18:10,680
You move the hand to where you wish to start the shield

3117
04:18:11,319 --> 04:18:16,120
Why then you hold down the action button and trace the perimeter of the shield?

3118
04:18:16,840 --> 04:18:18,360
like this

3119
04:18:18,360 --> 04:18:20,360
and the shield

3120
04:18:20,520 --> 04:18:24,360
I'll throw these rocks at the hut and watch the shield

3121
04:18:34,670 --> 04:18:47,629
All right, it's protected the shield deflects the rocks

3122
04:18:48,430 --> 04:18:50,430
Now you can try

3123
04:18:50,430 --> 04:18:52,829
Shield the hut and I will attack it

3124
04:18:53,549 --> 04:18:57,709
Tap the shield medical and wait hold the action button

3125
04:19:01,549 --> 04:19:03,850
This is black and white

3126
04:19:11,120 --> 04:19:13,120
The shield is ready

3127
04:19:19,399 --> 04:19:21,799
Is there a throw rock spell or something that i'm missing

3128
04:19:22,600 --> 04:19:25,639
The hut survived my onslaught. Well done

3129
04:19:26,360 --> 04:19:30,520
Different sized objects to different levels of damage to a shield

3130
04:19:31,159 --> 04:19:38,760
It will disappear after taking excessive damages. I have given the knowledge of the from now on your people can worship

3131
04:19:39,399 --> 04:19:43,020
Thank you

3132
04:19:43,020 --> 04:19:45,020
It's really hard to obtain and to install

3133
04:19:45,260 --> 04:19:47,260
Yeah, it's a pain in the ass

3134
04:19:47,420 --> 04:19:49,420
But I got it running

3135
04:19:49,420 --> 04:19:52,219
And I got it running in 1080. So i'm happy about that

3136
04:19:53,020 --> 04:19:55,639
Whatever that's protected good

3137
04:20:00,250 --> 04:20:03,260
All right, I need to

3138
04:20:03,579 --> 04:20:07,850
What are you up to?

3139
04:20:07,850 --> 04:20:09,530
I think it's time

3140
04:20:09,530 --> 04:20:14,479
Is he watering good job. All right, so we need

3141
04:20:16,889 --> 04:20:18,250
What else do I need?

3142
04:20:18,250 --> 04:20:25,899
I'm sure this will probably tell me you have become well established

3143
04:20:26,620 --> 04:20:31,260
Our combined strength is becoming greater. We're gonna do an attack near lethys

3144
04:20:31,340 --> 04:20:35,340
It will become more essential to have your miracle skills in top form

3145
04:20:36,059 --> 04:20:39,440
For this you must experience the benefit of gestures

3146
04:20:40,940 --> 04:20:45,559
Can charge miracles without having to return to your temple to select them

3147
04:20:45,719 --> 04:20:48,840
Here comes a fight move your hand in a spiral like this

3148
04:20:52,920 --> 04:20:57,799
Now select the miracle of your choice grain is selected like this

3149
04:20:58,520 --> 04:21:00,520
Oh god

3150
04:21:06,270 --> 04:21:11,549
I can't see the symbols in the bottom right rise to the bottom right of the screen. They're cut off from me, too

3151
04:21:12,430 --> 04:21:13,870
Damn it

3152
04:21:13,870 --> 04:21:15,870
You try it now. Okay

3153
04:21:17,260 --> 04:21:19,260
um

3154
04:21:42,649 --> 04:21:45,450
Oh for the love of god, I can't see them

3155
04:21:47,680 --> 04:21:53,680
I can't see

3156
04:21:55,040 --> 04:21:59,760
You should practice your gestures go on and press this town over here, okay

3157
04:22:00,879 --> 04:22:02,920
fireball

3158
04:22:02,920 --> 04:22:04,920
They look like they're in a bad way

3159
04:22:05,319 --> 04:22:07,319
No food or wood

3160
04:22:07,399 --> 04:22:13,319
Why don't you create some food for their village store while I supply them with wood?

3161
04:22:14,040 --> 04:22:19,559
Hmm that's a good idea you have people worshiping at your worship site

3162
04:22:23,069 --> 04:22:25,069
I have to get rid of the fallout wait

3163
04:22:25,760 --> 04:22:27,200
Wait, hold on

3164
04:22:27,200 --> 04:22:37,530
Did that go straight up and straight down? What?

3165
04:22:38,510 --> 04:22:43,309
Why did that happen?

3166
04:22:43,309 --> 04:22:48,000
Is everyone all right?

3167
04:22:48,000 --> 04:22:56,969
Oh, thank god. I didn't hit a building. Okay. I need to get I need to go to my worship site thing

3172
04:23:31,049 --> 04:23:37,709
How many times do I have to do this dude

3173
04:23:44,190 --> 04:23:50,639
Did I not do it you need to fill up the village store with food

3174
04:23:50,639 --> 04:23:52,639
Food

3175
04:24:07,100 --> 04:24:13,600
Give me that food you creatures getting tired we'll let them sleep

3176
04:24:24,969 --> 04:24:29,129
Hey look at that they like us you need to fill up the village store with food

3177

3178
04:24:40,879 --> 04:24:41,920
I

3179
04:24:41,920 --> 04:24:48,719
Time is not kind. You need to gain influence in the direction of our common enemy. Are you winning?

3180
04:24:50,239 --> 04:24:53,120
I strongly encourage you to gain this town

3181
04:24:53,840 --> 04:24:58,559
Before I leave to defend my realm. I must tell you one more thing

3182
04:25:03,690 --> 04:25:09,049
You will notice you cannot do anything even cast miracles outside of your influence

3183
04:25:09,690 --> 04:25:13,290
However, there is a way using the power of belief

3184
04:25:14,729 --> 04:25:20,170
You can reach outside the edge of your realm for short periods of time

3185
04:25:21,209 --> 04:25:25,690
But your influence is soon lost until your hand is returned to your realm

3186
04:25:30,170 --> 04:25:32,649
Hey, who's winning?

3187
04:25:32,649 --> 04:25:35,680

Uh, all the chili lime was not on any of the pieces of meat

3193

3494
04:53:41,540 --> 04:53:44,939
Why can I not zoom in now?

3495
04:53:44,939 --> 04:53:49,360
What did I do? I leaned my hand down and pressed a button

3541
04:57:01,220 --> 04:57:05,979
Oh

3542
04:57:05,979 --> 04:57:15,979
He almost figured it out. Look at this

3543
04:57:17,900 --> 04:57:18,860
You see?

3544
04:57:18,860 --> 04:57:23,700

Yeah, you try it. No, he doesn't know. He's just stupid

3548
04:57:40,180 --> 04:57:42,180
He's too stupid

3549
04:57:42,770 --> 04:57:44,770
He needs to learn fireball. He does

3550
04:57:45,169 --> 04:57:47,860
Look, there's another one right here

3551
04:57:48,750 --> 04:57:49,869
Come here

3552
04:57:49,869 --> 04:57:51,729
Take a look

3553
04:57:51,729 --> 04:57:58,400
Do you see?

3554
04:57:58,400 --> 04:58:01,680
Do you see?

3555
04:58:01,680 --> 04:58:06,639
Why wait? Why do I have this stupid leash on? Why is this leash on? I've never equipped this leash once

3556
04:58:07,119 --> 04:58:10,750
Why is this on?

3557
04:58:10,750 --> 04:58:12,750
I've never put this leash on. Why is it on?

3558
04:58:18,849 --> 04:58:24,270
Why is this leash on?

3559
04:58:24,270 --> 04:58:27,549
I'm serious. Why is that leash on? I didn't equip that

3560
04:58:28,349 --> 04:58:36,080
Give me a break. What? I pressed V. Oh, give me a fucking break

3561
04:58:44,619 --> 04:58:46,619
Oh my god, he learns 10 percent

3562
04:58:59,020 --> 04:59:01,340
You're feeding it nutrients through the umbilical cord

3563
04:59:03,020 --> 04:59:05,759
All right, come here fireball. You and I are gonna learn

3564
04:59:06,799 --> 04:59:08,639
You and me

3565
04:59:08,639 --> 04:59:14,770
Come here fireball

3566
04:59:24,779 --> 04:59:26,779
No, no fireball

3567
04:59:27,419 --> 04:59:34,909
Is it queuing up? It looks like it should be

3568
04:59:38,130 --> 04:59:40,130
Uh, I don't want to go in this guy's territory yet

3569
04:59:40,689 --> 04:59:46,299
Stay over here

3570
04:59:46,299 --> 04:59:48,619
Oh, it's because worshipers and there's no worshipers, right?

3571
04:59:49,419 --> 04:59:52,990
All right, well get back in here and

04:59:52,990 --> 04:59:54,990
Get these people entertained for now

3573
05:00:05,819 --> 05:00:07,819
That was 39 belief points. All right

3574
05:00:26,000 --> 05:00:28,159
I gave them wood. I gave them fire

3575
05:00:28,959 --> 05:00:36,590
It's all right. Is this fireball still not ready?

3576
05:00:41,360 --> 05:00:49,520
Oh, whatever. I'm just gonna let go. I'm gonna go back this way. How are you guys doing on fireball?

3577
05:00:51,229 --> 05:00:53,229
Fireball's made? Wait

3579
05:00:59,490 --> 05:01:02,130
Why can't they make it? Is it enough people or food or?

3580
05:01:02,849 --> 05:01:07,759
I don't know

3581
05:01:16,959 --> 05:01:21,689
Sacrifice somebody

3582
05:01:35,500 --> 05:01:37,500
Uh, what's why can I not select fireball?

3583
05:01:38,619 --> 05:01:44,860
Why is it not getting any uh

3584
05:01:44,860 --> 05:01:48,380
Teach the cow that I don't think I want to well, why can I not select any of these?

05:01:54,430 --> 05:01:56,430
Okay, there we go

He apparently doesn't want to do it and you make too many kids

3632
05:06:14,599 --> 05:06:19,400
No, I made a wonder of the world that took like five houses worth of material

3633
05:06:20,200 --> 05:06:24,430
I'm not gonna ever learn fireball without a bunch of people

3634

I didn't teach him this that's why there's so many people that's so so populated

3650
05:07:57,150 --> 05:08:00,430
There's so many kids running around because in the very beginning when we first got here

3651
05:08:00,430 --> 05:08:03,310
He was casting the offspring. He was knighting people

Until like that. I saw most of what I wanted to see and then do the second one at some other time

05:36:41,159 --> 05:36:45,240
The poisoned source is the village store. We can heal them now

3921
05:36:48,349 --> 05:36:59,209
Wait, was it the right guy?

3922

It was right. What do you mean? No, no

3923
05:37:09,900 --> 05:37:25,310
That was a neutral village

All right, so that was the source

3940
05:38:45,959 --> 05:38:47,959
So now what the fuck do I do heal?

3941
05:38:49,549 --> 05:38:54,509

Everybody loves him

4511
06:42:50,750 --> 06:42:54,650
And look at how nice he's being

4512
06:42:54,650 --> 06:43:00,840
This is an ally's village

4513
06:43:00,840 --> 06:43:04,110
Is it though?

4514
06:43:04,110 --> 06:43:05,310
No, it's not

4515
06:43:05,310 --> 06:43:13,290
No, it's not it's neutral

4516
06:43:13,919 --> 06:43:15,919
He must be kind and generous good

4517
06:43:16,159 --> 06:43:18,169
Do something kind

4518
06:43:18,169 --> 06:43:20,169
Well, i'm gonna do with some what's that?

4519
06:43:20,490 --> 06:43:34,119
What does he have?

4520
06:43:34,119 --> 06:43:37,389
The game crashed

4521
06:43:43,240 --> 06:43:45,240
What why did it crash

4522
06:43:47,869 --> 06:43:49,869
What the fuck happened?

4523
06:43:51,240 --> 06:43:53,240
I want to do something kind

4524
06:43:57,659 --> 06:44:01,049
When did it save?

4525
06:44:01,049 --> 06:44:03,229
No

4526
06:44:03,229 --> 06:44:04,909
When did it save?

4527
06:44:04,909 --> 06:44:06,909
I'm so sad right now

4528
06:44:07,150 --> 06:44:09,389
We're about we're about to get really get rolling

4529
06:44:10,110 --> 06:44:16,810
It was pretty recently, right?

4530
06:44:16,810 --> 06:44:18,810
He wants to do something generous

4531
06:44:29,049 --> 06:44:33,930
Your temple is built excellent. What the fuck are you talking about?

4532
06:44:44,720 --> 06:44:51,819
What this is my land leave?

4533
06:44:52,220 --> 06:44:53,419
Save

4534
06:44:53,419 --> 06:44:55,979
Load the auto save this this is the auto save

4535
06:45:04,029 --> 06:45:07,500
What happened?

4536
06:45:07,500 --> 06:45:09,500
It can't be hold on

4537
06:45:10,599 --> 06:45:12,599
No, what the fuck was that?

4538
06:45:16,240 --> 06:45:18,880
What? Oh, no, no, no

4539
06:45:19,520 --> 06:45:21,520
No, it's did it just save it right there?

4540
06:45:25,049 --> 06:45:27,049
Oh, did I just fuck it? Is it over?

4541
06:45:27,369 --> 06:45:30,330
Because I I exited the game and it saved it after I exited the game

4542
06:45:32,439 --> 06:45:35,080
No, it it it loads up the auto save every time

4543
06:45:36,970 --> 06:45:39,290
That I I exited the game once and came back

4544
06:45:42,619 --> 06:45:45,099
Oh, no, that's so horrible. Hold on

4545
06:45:45,659 --> 06:45:51,799
Let me see if there's like more than one

4546
06:45:55,229 --> 06:45:57,389
Because no, I mean you remember like an hour or two ago

4547
06:45:57,950 --> 06:46:02,110
When I open I reopened the game and it put us back in the right spot with an auto save

4548
06:46:02,669 --> 06:46:03,549
so

4549
06:46:03,549 --> 06:46:12,040
Let me see

4550
06:46:12,040 --> 06:46:14,439
Let me just see if I go back in what happens

4551
06:46:15,080 --> 06:46:19,240
I want your saves folder. I don't know the hell that is

4552
06:46:19,959 --> 06:46:22,040
Let's see

4553
06:46:22,040 --> 06:46:24,090
black and white

4554
06:46:24,090 --> 06:46:25,950
profiles

4555
06:46:25,950 --> 06:46:28,590
saved games

4556
06:46:28,590 --> 06:46:30,959
All right. I have what the hell?

4557
06:46:34,619 --> 06:46:37,119
8 56 pm

4558
06:46:37,119 --> 06:46:38,959
and then

4559
06:46:38,959 --> 06:46:41,200
No, this is all wrong

4560
06:46:41,360 --> 06:46:43,360
8 56 pm was literally two minutes ago

4561
06:46:46,000 --> 06:46:49,209
I don't think this is correct though

4562
06:46:49,209 --> 06:46:54,080
Let me go in in the temple

4563
06:46:54,080 --> 06:46:57,840
Hey, the 8 56 pm is the one that I just did when I exited

4564
06:47:00,599 --> 06:47:01,639
No

4565
06:47:01,639 --> 06:47:07,150
I'm gonna back up the folder

4566
06:47:07,150 --> 06:47:10,990
This is fucking weird though because all right. So the last apparently saved game I have

4567
06:47:11,790 --> 06:47:13,790
Is from 6 pm

4568
06:47:15,020 --> 06:47:17,020
That's why it went back that far why

4569
06:47:17,959 --> 06:47:20,840
There's been at least four or five different times where it's auto saved

4570
06:47:21,400 --> 06:47:31,119
That's unfortunate. Hold on. Let me just go in and see if I can pick something else

4571
06:47:34,270 --> 06:47:36,349
Oh, I was just getting into it, too

4572
06:47:37,389 --> 06:47:51,520
Let me see what happens. Okay, let's go in the temple

4573
06:47:54,750 --> 06:47:57,150
Yeah, because look at this. This this is completely wrong

4574
06:47:57,950 --> 06:47:59,950
This is literally the beginning of the level

4575
06:48:00,430 --> 06:48:02,430
Not even close like I we've

4576
06:48:03,150 --> 06:48:05,790
I've auto saved like 10. I've I've this is wrong

4577
06:48:06,590 --> 06:48:09,520
Like completely wrong unless the whole thing corrupted and broke

4578
06:48:10,240 --> 06:48:14,810
Which I mean, that's pretty possible. It's a fucking like almost 20 year old game

4579
06:48:16,119 --> 06:48:18,599
Um game options room. What do I try and look at it?

4580
06:48:23,930 --> 06:48:32,880
save game room

4581
06:48:32,880 --> 06:48:39,279
This is the room where you save and load the game the problem with this is though save the game now boys

4582
06:48:39,840 --> 06:48:46,000
Don't save the game click on a picture to zoom into it. I was told by the yellow that this room doesn't work empty frame

4583
06:48:46,639 --> 06:48:49,389
Then type in a save game name

4584
06:48:50,119 --> 06:48:52,759
I was told this crashes the game. What's up here? Hold on

4585
06:48:56,950 --> 06:49:04,299
8 42. Wait a minute boys and girls. We're fucking good to go. That's 8 42 pm on wednesday, january

4586
06:49:05,180 --> 06:49:11,479
Hold on. What's the other one?

4587
06:49:11,479 --> 06:49:13,479
8 54 pm on january 8th

4588
06:49:16,060 --> 06:49:20,090
That has to be it

4589
06:49:20,090 --> 06:49:22,810
8 30. Yeah, it has to be that one. It's it's 8 54

4590
06:49:23,450 --> 06:49:30,729
That's the one you want to load this game. Yeah

4591
06:49:31,369 --> 06:49:39,240
Here it is

4592
06:49:39,240 --> 06:49:42,360
You're crazy. Yes. Oh, i'm so happy. Thank god

4593
06:49:43,709 --> 06:49:45,709

4594
06:49:46,270 --> 06:49:55,369
Hooray, but i'm gonna take this time

4595
06:49:57,369 --> 06:49:59,869
It's been about seven hours

4596
06:50:00,509 --> 06:50:02,509

Pick up a rock or something pick up a rock

4632
06:54:12,409 --> 06:54:17,759
The creature has refused your creatures offer a friendship

4633
06:54:18,319 --> 06:54:20,319
What is going on?

4634
06:54:25,389 --> 06:54:27,389
Don't throw it. Don't

4635
06:54:37,840 --> 06:54:39,840
He tried to be his friend

4636
06:54:41,020 --> 06:54:44,299
I'm not using the friendship leash. I have the aggressive one on

4637
06:54:47,709 --> 06:55:01,529

All right, he's good he needs to eat

4659
06:57:09,689 --> 06:57:14,000
Should we do some more strike training?

4660
06:57:14,000 --> 06:57:15,520
Take this. Oh dear

4661
06:57:15,520 --> 06:57:17,520
Fewer of your people are believing in you

4662
06:57:18,240 --> 06:57:25,500
Whatever. I got this

4663
06:57:25,500 --> 06:57:29,740
Now don't throw it walk. Oh you idiot. Actually he threw that pretty far. He must have better strike

And then we're gonna go we're gonna go take over that fucking village. We're gonna go kill that guy

4671
06:58:13,159 --> 06:58:17,319
We're gonna kill that guy

4672
06:58:17,319 --> 06:58:19,639
You have food

4673
06:58:19,639 --> 06:58:23,290
But I will give you more

4674
06:58:32,060 --> 06:58:35,229
Good all right, he's just going did you sleep yet?

4675
06:58:36,869 --> 06:58:39,840
aggressive

4676
06:58:39,840 --> 06:58:41,840
Let's go

4677
06:58:41,840 --> 06:58:48,000
What is this?

4678
06:58:48,000 --> 06:58:54,880
Thank goodness. It's you you're the only one who can help me my temple here keeps getting flooded during heavy rain

4679
06:58:55,520 --> 06:58:59,439
The building consists of separate rings which you place over these columns

4680
06:58:59,919 --> 06:59:05,919
Please I beg you move the sections up the beach to rebuild it on the furthest column where it'll be safe

4681
06:59:06,400 --> 06:59:12,639
But the temple has to be moved correctly the architect left an explanation on this signpost. All right, I don't care

4682
06:59:12,799 --> 06:59:19,080
That's that that's not what I care about right now. I care about killing this guy

4683
06:59:19,880 --> 06:59:27,759
I want to do moves

4684
06:59:28,560 --> 06:59:32,240
In the middle of a fight and I did it once

4685
06:59:32,880 --> 06:59:38,729
I wonder if he does it on his own or if I have to command him to do those moves

4686
06:59:39,450 --> 06:59:54,380
All right, let's go

4687
06:59:54,380 --> 07:00:01,389
What we got over here? We got some shit over here create melodies on these stones to awaken the spirits of the ancients

4688
07:00:01,950 --> 07:00:06,590
Few people know the melodies but who knows we may be able to do it

4689
07:00:06,990 --> 07:00:08,990
Meet them boys free storm

4690
07:00:12,270 --> 07:00:16,319
There it goes free storm and free heal

4691
07:00:17,680 --> 07:00:19,819
Gonna use it right now

4692
07:00:19,819 --> 07:00:21,819
And then also free lightning

4693
07:00:23,740 --> 07:00:25,500
Where's that fucking cat?

4694
07:00:25,500 --> 07:00:47,959
What's he doing?

4695
07:00:47,959 --> 07:00:50,330
Nice. I mean we both

4696
07:00:50,409 --> 07:00:52,409
We're both not really doing much

4697
07:00:52,409 --> 07:00:54,409
All right, get in here take it over

4698
07:00:55,479 --> 07:01:09,950
Did I do it with this my allies have failed me my nemesis have arrived to take control

4699
07:01:10,349 --> 07:01:23,869
Hey destiny, I will be the only god. What is this?

4700
07:01:24,750 --> 07:01:28,830
What about the turtle?

4701
07:01:28,830 --> 07:01:30,939
Oh, no

4702
07:01:30,939 --> 07:01:32,540
Can we save this?

4703
07:01:32,540 --> 07:01:35,180
You have defied me for the last time

4704
07:01:36,040 --> 07:01:38,040
nemesis no

4705
07:01:38,540 --> 07:01:42,779
Because uh, I know your creature hides a part of the creed inside him

4706
07:01:43,740 --> 07:01:48,779
I do not need it. I already have the power that three combined queens bring

4707
07:01:48,939 --> 07:01:52,459
You and I will use it to destroy you

4708
07:01:53,419 --> 07:02:04,110
What about all these people?

4709
07:02:04,110 --> 07:02:07,709
No

4710
07:02:07,709 --> 07:02:09,709
We didn't get to meet this turtle

4711
07:02:10,110 --> 07:02:12,110
But I still feel sad

4712
07:02:17,930 --> 07:02:28,830
Retrieve the creed from gaza's dead creature. You must not fall into our enemies hand. I have to get it

4713
07:02:29,470 --> 07:02:35,790
As always I will do as you command. I'll send my creature for it now. Oh shit. I gotta get it, too

4714
07:02:36,349 --> 07:02:49,849
All right, go get it

4715
07:02:49,849 --> 07:03:04,860
Okay, uh

4716
07:03:04,860 --> 07:03:08,939
Where's the creature?

4717
07:03:08,939 --> 07:03:11,099
I'm in game. I am not in game

4718
07:03:27,389 --> 07:03:29,389
What is this creature across the whole game?

4719
07:03:29,869 --> 07:03:35,150
Did I fuck it up when I started? He's got an element of the creed. Oh, I must have screwed it up

4720
07:03:36,669 --> 07:03:40,110
He was really far away from when I was fighting him

4721
07:03:47,560 --> 07:03:59,869
He had to run from across the whole map. He's doing the terrible walk

4722
07:04:06,360 --> 07:04:10,360
I can't believe it cuz you're wiped out like a bug

4723
07:04:11,319 --> 07:04:17,400
I understand what the old guide meant now the power of three creeds must be combined

4724
07:04:17,720 --> 07:04:24,439
But nemesis said he has three creeds. Yes, but he's after the others to stop us getting them

4725
07:04:25,000 --> 07:04:27,000
We've got to get them then

4726
07:04:27,540 --> 07:04:31,529
Absolutely

4727
07:04:31,529 --> 07:04:33,529
We need more wood

4728
07:04:33,930 --> 07:04:35,930
What the hell do you want me to do about this?

4729
07:04:38,720 --> 07:04:44,220
What am I? What do you want me to do now? You creatures? What am I? What the fuck am I doing?

4730
07:04:46,540 --> 07:04:48,540
Do I have to go through like the portal?

4731
07:04:49,840 --> 07:04:55,520
What is all this shit?

4732
07:04:55,520 --> 07:04:57,119
Head to yellow

4733
07:04:57,119 --> 07:05:02,360
All right. I'm gonna go to yellow

4734
07:05:02,360 --> 07:05:07,840

4737
07:05:16,029 --> 07:05:22,490
Where is my creature?

4738
07:05:22,490 --> 07:05:28,919
Pick that up

4739
07:05:28,919 --> 07:05:31,130
No

4740
07:05:31,130 --> 07:05:34,650
Good throw though

4741
07:05:34,650 --> 07:05:37,930
An enemy is trying to influence your village. Whack him

4742
07:05:38,729 --> 07:05:40,139
um

4743
07:05:40,139 --> 07:05:42,139
What the fuck are you talking about?

4744
07:05:51,680 --> 07:06:01,049
All right, I need heal. Do I not have heal? Oh, I lost heal

4745
07:06:02,409 --> 07:06:03,930

You have a lot of food and i'm taking almost all of it

4750
07:06:22,779 --> 07:06:24,299
Go through the portal

Where the portal even open?

4752
07:06:27,770 --> 07:06:33,529
Look at how much food is in here

4753
07:06:33,529 --> 07:06:48,380
What are you doing with that rock?

4754
07:06:48,619 --> 07:06:55,369
Why are you carrying a rock? It's just killing animals

4755
07:06:56,540 --> 07:07:02,090
Okay

4756
07:07:02,330 --> 07:07:04,330

Okay, let's go

4765
07:07:41,840 --> 07:07:45,849

4768
07:07:54,750 --> 07:07:56,750
Just to walk in the portal

4769
07:08:10,119 --> 07:08:12,119
I have to get the rest of the towns

This motherfucker doesn't even have another village

4883
07:23:35,560 --> 07:23:41,240

4884
07:23:41,240 --> 07:23:43,799

4899
07:26:02,590 --> 07:26:04,830
Send peeps and missionaries over there

4900
07:26:09,209 --> 07:26:11,529
I I didn't I didn't even like do that tutorial

4901
07:26:12,330 --> 07:26:16,299
I don't even know how to do that

4902
07:26:16,299 --> 07:26:19,020
That was that even an available tutorial to do

4903
07:26:24,409 --> 07:26:25,849
That's it

4904
07:26:25,849 --> 07:26:34,799
Did I win you are truly a powerful god, but you failed to defeat me

4905
07:26:37,869 --> 07:26:40,830
Let's see how powerful you are without your creature

4906
07:26:41,470 --> 07:26:47,709
Look, he's heading for the vortex. He's mesmerized what the creature get him on a leash quickly

4907
07:26:48,909 --> 07:27:02,860
The leash isn't working

4908
07:27:15,049 --> 07:27:21,930
No, he's gone through and so is lathis lathis has taken our creature. What are we going to do?

4909
07:27:22,650 --> 07:27:29,529
It's to get him back. Let's go through. Yes scripted. It's scripted. Let's think about this. It could be a trap

4910
07:27:30,169 --> 07:27:36,250
No, there ain't time to think the vortex is closing but we don't know what's on the other side

4911
07:27:36,650 --> 07:27:41,130
Our creature is on the other side. That's all we need to know. Let's go

4912
07:27:46,959 --> 07:27:48,959
Is it actually closing get it go go

4913
07:27:49,520 --> 07:27:59,279
Wasn't a trap, but we better find our creature here. He's going to be around here somewhere

4914
07:27:59,840 --> 07:28:04,750
What was that?

4915
07:28:04,750 --> 07:28:06,750
It sounded like a creature

4916
07:28:06,990 --> 07:28:11,229
What look he's trapped. No, they got him trapped agony

4917
07:28:12,349 --> 07:28:17,470
This creature is torturing him. Why is he gonna play for this?

4918
07:28:17,869 --> 07:28:20,509
It looks like those statues are holding him in place

4919
07:28:21,229 --> 07:28:24,299
Oh

4920
07:28:25,819 --> 07:28:29,580
Only the prayers of many villages could be that strong. Oh, no

4921
07:28:36,080 --> 07:28:41,389
Oh boy

4922
07:28:41,389 --> 07:28:42,990
well

4923
07:28:42,990 --> 07:28:51,229
Uh-huh

4924
07:28:51,229 --> 07:28:54,169
It's our village store

4925
07:28:54,169 --> 07:28:55,930
That's it right there

4926
07:28:55,930 --> 07:28:57,930
That was fucking so fun though

4927
07:28:59,020 --> 07:29:01,580
I love that little cow. All right, how do I um

4928
07:29:02,540 --> 07:29:09,959
Do I have any abilities?

4929
07:29:10,040 --> 07:29:13,159
I think we need to get this village built. Yeah, but I don't have yeah

4930
07:29:13,240 --> 07:29:19,159
We gotta be strong for when we get our creature back. This place will give us a foundation to fight from

4931
07:29:21,020 --> 07:29:23,979
I I don't do I have any actual villagers though?

4932
07:29:25,419 --> 07:29:27,020

4933
07:29:27,020 --> 07:29:28,700

4934
07:29:28,700 --> 07:29:30,700
Guess you are. Okay

4937
07:29:40,560 --> 07:29:42,400
disciple builder

4938
07:29:42,400 --> 07:29:47,770
Oh, they're building up a temple right now. I see

4939
07:29:52,119 --> 07:29:54,759
All right. Yeah, that's it. That's it. I'm gonna call it for tonight

4940
07:29:55,400 --> 07:30:00,520
We may depend tomorrow. We may come back tomorrow. It's been seven and a half hours

4941
07:30:01,400 --> 07:30:05,959
Uh don't want I didn't want to stream for more than seven eight nine. I don't want to stream for like 10 hours

4942
07:30:08,009 --> 07:30:13,290
So we we may do this tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then i'm gonna probably do uh katana zero tomorrow

4943
07:30:14,889 --> 07:30:16,779
But we'll see

4944
07:30:16,779 --> 07:30:18,779
I might play this tomorrow

4945
07:30:23,959 --> 07:30:25,959
He lied about the 10 hour stream kind of

4946
07:30:27,279 --> 07:30:29,599
But this is like really I love this game

4947
07:30:32,490 --> 07:30:34,490
Some of this shit was so stupid

4948
07:30:35,709 --> 07:30:36,430
Oh

4949
07:30:36,430 --> 07:30:38,430
What what a great game?

4950
07:30:38,750 --> 07:30:40,430
All right, it's it's saved

4951
07:30:40,430 --> 07:30:42,430
Uh, yeah, it's just it'll save right here

4952
07:30:44,720 --> 07:30:48,560
Keep playing it. Yeah, i'll get better at managing stuff, too

4953
07:30:50,720 --> 07:30:54,240
We'll we'll do it again tomorrow. We'll do it again tomorrow. And if it gets a little stale

4954
07:30:54,799 --> 07:30:57,599
Uh after like a couple hours, we'll uh, we'll move on to something else

4955
07:31:00,540 --> 07:31:02,540
But uh, let's do the bits and subs and everything

4956
07:31:03,689 --> 07:31:05,290
Thanks for joining me as always

4957
07:31:05,290 --> 07:31:07,400
We'll see you tomorrow

4958
07:31:07,400 --> 07:31:09,080
same time

4959
07:31:09,080 --> 07:31:11,080
Uh around one to two pm pacific

4960
07:31:11,799 --> 07:31:21,319
We'll see you tomorrow

4961
07:31:21,319 --> 07:31:23,319
first stream welcome

4962
07:31:29,549 --> 07:31:32,560
Do the other night's bits

4963
07:31:32,560 --> 07:31:35,680
Yeah, i'll pull those up. I'm gonna do them very very quickly though

4964
07:31:36,720 --> 07:31:37,919
just because

4965
07:31:37,919 --> 07:31:40,000
We have uh looks like a lot to go through tonight, too

4966
07:31:43,159 --> 07:31:47,000
So I don't want to have everybody sitting here potentially for the next two or three hours

4967
07:31:47,959 --> 07:31:50,650
Because then it will be a 10 hour stream

4968
07:31:51,770 --> 07:31:58,240
It will be a 10 hour stream, but we'll see you tomorrow. Let's go back a few days ago

4969
07:31:59,869 --> 07:32:04,919
uh, this is when

4970
07:32:04,919 --> 07:32:07,689
I got cut off

4971
07:32:07,689 --> 07:32:10,090
It was this one here doctor officer fireman. Here we are

4972
07:32:10,729 --> 07:32:12,729
All right, we'll go through these

4973
07:32:12,729 --> 07:32:19,479
I'm gonna do them quickly and we'll move on to today's pizza tier list. I don't think I can do that whenever

4974
07:32:20,360 --> 07:32:23,639
We had 50 dollars a few days ago file is remember this is all from four days ago

4975
07:32:23,639 --> 07:32:26,279
So some of these things people might be saying might be completely inaccurate

4976
07:32:27,400 --> 07:32:29,419
for today

4977
07:32:29,419 --> 07:32:33,020
But uh, they say germa is the police. I was playing the police fire and emt game

4978
07:32:36,040 --> 07:32:40,169
So they say germa is the police munker s thank you phylactery for the

4979
07:32:41,130 --> 07:32:43,529
Almost it seems like every single stream you give more than

4980
07:32:44,169 --> 07:32:46,810
50 to 100 dollars in bits. It's crazy or subs

4981
07:32:47,689 --> 07:32:49,290
Thank you

4982
07:32:49,290 --> 07:32:51,529

Love you in the majority empathetic community. You have genuinely made my life better

4988
07:33:09,720 --> 07:33:10,759

Thanks for watching t yick. Thanks for the 500 bits

4992
07:33:27,950 --> 07:33:32,189
Crow rad thanks to the 500 bits. This game is kind of quiet without music. Could you play happy rock?

4993
07:33:32,669 --> 07:33:35,119
I don't know. That is phylactery gave another fucking

4994
07:33:36,619 --> 07:33:41,950
5,000 bits again, like I told you before he does it every stream

4995
07:33:42,590 --> 07:33:44,029
It's crazy

4996
07:33:45,689 --> 07:33:48,569
We were trying to call ambulances seeing how many we can call it once

4997
07:33:49,290 --> 07:33:53,659
Now they say I need you to find out how many ambulances we can call it once. I think it was like four

4998
07:33:55,389 --> 07:33:58,220
I got out of that game though

4999
07:33:58,220 --> 07:34:01,340
Spliceable spleen. Thanks for the 500 bits. Hey germa. I just wanted you to let you know

5000
07:34:01,979 --> 07:34:06,060
Uh how much your streams have meant to me over the past year. You're an amazing entertainer

5001
07:34:06,619 --> 07:34:10,349
Hope you feel loved and appreciated on the new year stream for everything you do on stream

5002
07:34:13,229 --> 07:34:15,229

Trust me when I say I feel very very much

5006
07:34:23,389 --> 07:34:29,840
Super loved the channel crossed 10,000 subs on New Year's Eve. So it's like

5007
07:34:30,560 --> 07:34:33,439
What else can I even say? Like it's been a fucking wild ride

5008
07:34:34,240 --> 07:34:38,380
They all say I want you to let you know that I was indeed the nancy drew one guy

5009
07:34:38,459 --> 07:34:42,139
It started as a simple suggestion, but it blew out of proportion. I'm sorry

5010
07:34:42,860 --> 07:34:46,409
Hey, don't apologize. Don't don't ever apologize for fucking

5011
07:34:47,049 --> 07:34:52,060
Don't ever apologize for being the smartest person in the room. You know what i'm saying?

5012
07:34:57,419 --> 07:35:01,500
Thank you never electra for the thousand bits. Thanks for helping with my depression my dude

5013
07:35:03,470 --> 07:35:08,380

5021
07:35:59,849 --> 07:36:02,090
And if you are going through a really really really rough time

5022
07:36:03,310 --> 07:36:05,310
I really implore you to seek out

5023
07:36:05,950 --> 07:36:10,240
somebody that can help you because it's one thing to be able to

5024
07:36:10,560 --> 07:36:15,680
Forget about it for a little while and hang out on a stream and just chill and fuck around with some friends and buddies and stuff

5025
07:36:17,020 --> 07:36:23,180
But it's another thing to try to make sure that you stay healthy and to actually you know, help yourself and treat yourself

5026
07:36:24,540 --> 07:36:26,700
Whether that's with somebody that's a professional or

5027
07:36:28,119 --> 07:36:33,419
Through a medical means, right?

5028
07:36:33,419 --> 07:36:35,419
Just make sure you're going through all the avenues you need to

5029
07:36:35,740 --> 07:36:42,650
I wish you the best of luck. Thank you

Thanks a lot noodle is bad at gaming. Thanks for the 250

5033
07:36:50,270 --> 07:36:55,310
Remember that dream is going to haunt me forever, but at least the wound from that splinter that sent me to the er is almost healed

5034
07:36:55,790 --> 07:37:00,029
Hope you had a great past couple days. Hope you had a great couple days, too

5035

Eat eat eat more like fucking vitamin d or something so you don't have dreams of me having sex on stream

5037
07:37:12,139 --> 07:37:14,490
speaking of dreams

5038
07:37:14,490 --> 07:37:20,729
Hikiki hikiki kora most sunday gave 300 bits germ. I'm back with another dream story right after that

5039
07:37:21,849 --> 07:37:26,250
Uh, you were holding some big meetup concert event at his stadium and the tickets sold out in five minutes

5040
07:37:26,810 --> 07:37:30,169
So I got the stadium and had to fix my makeup. So I went to this huge

5041
07:37:30,790 --> 07:37:35,529
Unisex bathroom and saw some of the people from the discord sub chat were there and for some reason we were like

5042
07:37:35,529 --> 07:37:37,529
Let's have a pre-event party in here

5043
07:37:37,770 --> 07:37:42,029
So we had a rave in the restroom and I sent out a snapchat message to everyone

5044
07:37:44,060 --> 07:37:46,060
What the fuck is going on?

5045
07:37:50,909 --> 07:37:52,909
of rave in the bathroom

5046
07:37:53,770 --> 07:37:56,669
well, uh

5047
07:37:56,669 --> 07:37:58,840
bathrooms stink

5048
07:37:58,919 --> 07:38:02,919
I can't be in a public bathroom for more than two or three minutes tops

5049
07:38:03,400 --> 07:38:07,400
It just smells like pee. It smells like wet piss in every public bathroom

5050
07:38:07,400 --> 07:38:09,720
I've ever been a guy, you know what I mean? You know, you guys know what i'm talking about

5051
07:38:10,279 --> 07:38:12,680
It's it's like a wet humid pee smell

5052
07:38:13,319 --> 07:38:18,459
I hate it. Hey freudian weapon. Thanks for the six dolls and 50 cents

5053
07:38:19,470 --> 07:38:23,310
Happy saturday. Happy saturday. Well, it's not saturday anymore, but happy saturday when it was saturday

5054
07:38:25,599 --> 07:38:28,880
Swiggity swanky. Thanks for the 250 possible one guy moment here. Okay

5055
07:38:30,240 --> 07:38:34,720
This game nostalgically reminds me of the of a sim copter

5056
07:38:35,200 --> 07:38:40,939
A sim city flight simulator where you do similar tasks like in this game, but flying in a chopper

5057
07:38:46,040 --> 07:38:48,119
I still have to play like sim city for real

5058
07:38:49,119 --> 07:38:51,680
Oh, what's the easy one what's the one that was easy

5059
07:38:53,840 --> 07:38:56,330
cities skylines

5060
07:38:56,330 --> 07:39:03,529
That's like the easier more that's the the better one the one that's like more streamlined and easier to like understand is city skylines

5061
07:39:07,319 --> 07:39:13,470
Yeah, maybe hamster the pie. Thanks for the 250. Hi, i'm from ireland, but I spent the last summer working in boston

5062
07:39:13,950 --> 07:39:17,790
I asked on one stream once if there was anywhere that I should see and you said jillions

5063
07:39:18,430 --> 07:39:22,270
Had a great time there with friends after we saw there was a match starting

5064
07:39:22,830 --> 07:39:26,669
In fenway and tickets were cheap, so we got to know a confusing new sport

5065
07:39:27,930 --> 07:39:29,290
baseball

5066
07:39:29,290 --> 07:39:36,889
Baseball is like america's pastime been following baseball ever since back home now and we're setting up the first college baseball club in ireland

5067
07:39:37,799 --> 07:39:43,659
Thank you for setting off a chain of happy coincidences ps any baseball stories. I used to play baseball and softball

5068
07:39:44,380 --> 07:39:49,919
I haven't in many years, but the last time I played I played softball with a bunch of friends

5069
07:39:50,560 --> 07:39:52,560
We were in softball league in boston

5070
07:39:53,880 --> 07:39:56,680
And it was probably 23

5071
07:39:58,279 --> 07:40:00,279
24 was the last time I played

5072
07:40:00,919 --> 07:40:04,240
It's been a while. But yeah, it's a lot of fun

5073
07:40:06,919 --> 07:40:09,900
It is a lot of fun

5074
07:40:09,900 --> 07:40:12,240

5075
07:40:12,240 --> 07:40:18,319

5076
07:40:20,990 --> 07:40:22,990

Jeremy i've been watching your content since 2012 and it's my favorite stuff to watch

5079
07:40:31,959 --> 07:40:38,110
I try to watch as much of your streams as possible, but it'd be difficult because of the time differences between new zealand and the u.s

5080
07:40:38,669 --> 07:40:42,590
You're my inspiration role model and I aspire to be as awesome and funny as you one day

When are you going to finally take the moral high ground for once and endorse anthony bantony for president?

5103
07:42:49,020 --> 07:42:51,979
Uh your fence sitting and refusing to condemn his opponent dean dingus

5104
07:42:52,220 --> 07:43:02,090
Well, I might add strangled three people shows a clear lack of integrity. I don't I I my political endorsement was fucking benjamin franklin

5105
07:43:02,090 --> 07:43:03,209
There you go

5106
07:43:03,209 --> 07:43:11,049
There there you go anthony bantony or anthony bantony bantony bantony or dean dingus benjamin franklin

5107
07:43:11,610 --> 07:43:17,439
Motherfucker wasn't even a president and he got on the hundred. Okay

5108
07:43:18,779 --> 07:43:31,119
Whoa son of jenova. Thanks for the 250. Hi germa. Please consider cutting the last empty frames of germawalk. So it's a constant gif

5109
07:43:32,000 --> 07:43:35,119
Uh, I actually I did not make germawalk. It is a community emote

5110
07:43:35,680 --> 07:43:38,270
From better twitch.tv. I did not make it

5111
07:43:40,840 --> 07:43:44,599
And another germa pops up as soon as the first germawalks away from the screen

5112
07:43:45,790 --> 07:43:48,110
Um, I don't know. I didn't make it. I just enabled it

5113
07:43:48,669 --> 07:43:54,330
That is a community better twitch tv emote

5114
07:43:56,880 --> 07:44:00,799
I would direct that feedback towards the person that made that emote

5115
07:44:02,430 --> 07:44:04,430
How do I see it? You have to have better twitch tv

5116
07:44:07,549 --> 07:44:09,919
You made it on an alt account

5117
07:44:09,919 --> 07:44:12,080
Lizard amiibo. Thanks for the 1500 bits lizard

5118
07:44:12,720 --> 07:44:15,479
I could make this really long, but I just want to say thank you

5119
07:44:15,479 --> 07:44:21,400
You've had such a positive impact on my life this past year by inspiring me to be kinder and to pursue what I care about

5120
07:44:26,520 --> 07:44:31,799
Thanks for building such an incredible community and helping to convince me that things are going to work out in ways. I don't expect

5121
07:44:32,360 --> 07:44:38,060
That's true. That's the thing about life is

5122
07:44:38,939 --> 07:44:40,939
some things will happen

5123
07:44:41,020 --> 07:44:43,020
That you aren't prepared for

5124
07:44:43,500 --> 07:44:47,340
Some things will happen that you are prepared for some things will happen that you want to have happen

5125
07:44:47,340 --> 07:44:49,340
Some things will happen that you don't want to have happen

5126
07:44:50,250 --> 07:44:55,529
And some things will happen that you want to have happen that you didn't even know you wanted in the first place

5127
07:44:58,029 --> 07:45:00,029
so

5128
07:45:00,029 --> 07:45:14,090
Is it's a weird thing. That's five head. I mean, it's not it's not it wasn't a riddle

5129
07:45:14,729 --> 07:45:16,729
Break it down break down what I said

5130
07:45:16,729 --> 07:45:20,119
Pretty much what i'm saying is life is unpredictable

5131
07:45:21,450 --> 07:45:24,729
And even if you think you want to do something or you want x

5132
07:45:25,950 --> 07:45:28,409
Y might show up

5133
07:45:28,409 --> 07:45:46,810
And you go. Oh, wow. That's fucking awesome. That's exactly what I wanted happens all the time to people that sounds like a riddle

5134
07:45:48,569 --> 07:45:50,569
That's not how what?

5135
07:45:50,650 --> 07:45:54,169
Life is unpredictable. What's this riddle? The streamer is saying

5136
07:45:54,970 --> 07:45:58,189
Hmm

5137
07:45:58,189 --> 07:46:05,630
What is he?

5138
07:46:05,630 --> 07:46:16,200
Anyways, thank you lizard amiibo. Thanks for the 1500 fucking bits. Ooh, I must make stream what say what?

5139
07:46:18,639 --> 07:46:22,159
Sticks renegade. Thanks for the 250. I remember before that you were talking about your car months ago

5140
07:46:22,240 --> 07:46:25,439
Tell me how much do you know about your vehicle maintenance? I'm curious. None

5141
07:46:29,229 --> 07:46:33,310
If something bad happened to my car, I would not be able to fix it. I would have to call somebody

5142
07:46:34,639 --> 07:46:36,639
The only thing I know how to do

5143
07:46:36,720 --> 07:46:39,680
Is tell people that I know how to change a tire when I don't

5144
07:46:42,430 --> 07:46:45,229
And i'll tell me you guys can guys can sneer. Yeah

5145
07:46:46,360 --> 07:46:49,259
How many of you do that too?

5146
07:46:49,259 --> 07:46:53,500
Hey, dude, you know how to change a tire, right? Of course I do. What what are you an idiot?

5147
07:46:53,979 --> 07:47:00,159
Oh, okay. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I also don't fucking know how to change a tire and I i'm asking you but

5148
07:47:00,720 --> 07:47:08,590
Nobody knows how to change tire

5149
07:47:08,590 --> 07:47:11,389
The only people that know how to change a tire are car mechanics

5150
07:47:13,049 --> 07:47:18,729
And your dad if he's at least 50 years old nobody else does

5151
07:47:29,389 --> 07:47:31,950
It's so easy. No, it's not. It's very hard. It's impossible

5152
07:47:32,509 --> 07:47:45,229
It's too scary get a jack jacket change tire. No, it's too scary. That's terrifying. That's too scary

5153
07:47:45,549 --> 07:47:49,389
What if what if the car falls on my hands and it flattens like two pancakes? I'm not doing that

5154
07:47:49,950 --> 07:47:58,060
I need like a professional

5155
07:47:58,060 --> 07:48:11,319
That's a level one skill. No a level one skill is turning the shower on like that's that's a level one skill

5156
07:48:19,069 --> 07:48:24,250
No, I don't know shit about car maintenance I know about tire pressure

5157
07:48:25,130 --> 07:48:26,009
and

5158
07:48:26,009 --> 07:48:28,490
When the engine light turns on to take it somewhere

5159
07:48:30,759 --> 07:48:35,880
I also know how to put windshield washer fluid in a car and it's I mean that's not hard

5160
07:48:36,279 --> 07:48:46,599
Why don't I do my own oil? I don't know how to do an oil. Why I don't do my own oil changes

5161
07:48:48,319 --> 07:48:52,319
Why are we talking like this is some basic knowledge everyone changes their own oil

5162
07:48:55,020 --> 07:48:57,340
Guys, there are like burger king type shops

5163
07:48:57,900 --> 07:48:59,900
Every two miles to change oil

5164
07:49:00,639 --> 07:49:02,639
It's one of the biggest businesses in the country

5165
07:49:15,819 --> 07:49:18,540
What is an oil change is like 16 dollars

5166
07:49:21,049 --> 07:49:34,159
It's not like a thousand dollars to have somebody change your oil. It takes 16 minutes

5167
07:49:37,369 --> 07:49:44,409
Uh, all right this this I don't know. I I don't know. I don't know if i'm getting like trolled here, but I don't know anyone

5168
07:49:45,049 --> 07:49:48,009
Out of the dozens of people that I've ever come across in my life

5169
07:49:49,040 --> 07:49:52,720
None of them change their own oil. None. Not one person does not one

5170
07:49:53,520 --> 07:49:56,240
I'm talking to my family. I'm talking friends literally none of them

5171
07:50:09,549 --> 07:50:10,430
rich

5172
07:50:10,430 --> 07:50:12,349
rich guy

5173
07:50:12,349 --> 07:50:18,590
What i'm freaking out right now. How much is an oil change? It's like fucking 20 dollars

5174
07:50:24,560 --> 07:50:31,200
It's 25 bucks and 50 dollars being the most expensive like in the world. It's 20 dollars

5175
07:50:35,930 --> 07:50:39,770
You spent more money on hearthstone cards two or three years ago. Give me a break

5176
07:50:47,720 --> 07:50:49,720
I think I can go get an oil change

5177
07:50:50,349 --> 07:50:52,349
for 20 bucks if

5178
07:50:53,630 --> 07:51:11,930
I didn't spend a cent on hearthstone cards. Somebody did oil change. He's not changing his own oil

5179
07:51:13,040 --> 07:51:15,200
Yeah, i'm not lying on my I don't

5180
07:51:15,840 --> 07:51:20,080
I i'm i'm all right. I'm i'm moving on from biscuit. I just I don't understand how

5181
07:51:20,720 --> 07:51:22,720
I don't change my own oil

5182
07:51:25,520 --> 07:51:29,919
Is like the equivalent of me buying 50 packs of cigarettes every day

5183
07:51:42,729 --> 07:51:47,529
Same energy. That's what i'm saying. That's what i'm see you get it. You get it

5184
07:51:47,849 --> 07:51:53,599
You get it that guy gets it that guy gets it jackie. You get it jackie gets it

5185
07:51:55,680 --> 07:51:58,799
Do I drink the oil? No, i'm saying same energy man

5186
07:52:00,959 --> 07:52:04,240
All right, let's keep going. I don't change my own fucking oil

5187
07:52:04,959 --> 07:52:07,950
nobody does

5188
07:52:07,950 --> 07:52:10,669
I swear twitch chat is like they is

5189
07:52:11,630 --> 07:52:13,229
It does everything

5190
07:52:13,229 --> 07:52:25,400
Dude, I will call every single contact in my phone and say hey, when's the last time you changed your own oil?

5191
07:52:26,349 --> 07:52:28,110
Uh, I don't

5192
07:52:28,110 --> 07:52:32,680
Okay, hang up call the next person. Hey, when was the last time you changed your own oil?

5193
07:52:33,500 --> 07:52:35,740
I take it. I take it at jiffy lube. Oh, okay

5194
07:52:41,159 --> 07:52:43,400
Okay, i'm changing my oil right now

5195
07:52:44,490 --> 07:52:47,369
Yeah, I call somebody. Oh, hey, when's the last time you changed your own oil?

5196
07:52:48,009 --> 07:52:52,400
I'm doing it right now. Why do you not know how to do that? No, I don't

5197
07:52:52,639 --> 07:52:55,119
Ha serves you right you fucking dick

5198
07:52:59,959 --> 07:53:08,779
Sorry, this is my second pack of cigarettes today. How many of you smoked same energy? I like I agree same energy

5199
07:53:24,119 --> 07:53:32,860
I'm so glad this is confusing a lot a ton of people sick. All right, let's keep going. He's insecure about this

5200
07:53:50,380 --> 07:53:56,139
What percent of americans change their own oil? It's less than 20 percent

5201
07:53:56,860 --> 07:54:03,099
It's 18 percent of all the us car-owning population change their own fucking oil

5202
07:54:13,069 --> 07:54:20,029
The strong ones we didn't talk about strong or weak. We talked about how many people actually do the thing you think that everybody does

5203
07:54:23,319 --> 07:54:25,319
No, i'm getting i'm getting

5204
07:54:25,319 --> 07:54:26,759
I'm getting

5205
07:54:26,759 --> 07:54:30,200
I'm getting like gas lit. All right. I'm feeding into it. I gotta stop

5206
07:54:34,939 --> 07:54:37,500
You are the 82 percent. Yeah, okay

5207
07:54:38,220 --> 07:54:42,860
Oh, no, they they're doing it to me they're trying. All right, let's go. We gotta move. We gotta move

5208
07:54:42,939 --> 07:54:47,099
I know what I know what they're doing. I'm looking in the mirror right now. I know that that's what they're doing

5209
07:54:47,500 --> 07:54:54,919
You don't let them get in there. Hey mesa

5210
07:54:55,540 --> 07:54:57,299
Mesa rater

5211
07:54:57,299 --> 07:54:59,290
mmg

5212
07:54:59,290 --> 07:55:04,169
I had my 20th birthday the other day and I figured I'd ask if you had any tips on being old since you'd be the expert

5213
07:55:05,340 --> 07:55:08,220
Learn how to change your own oil. It'll save you

5214
07:55:10,080 --> 07:55:13,849
20 every uh, like fucking five months

5215
07:55:23,819 --> 07:55:25,979
There you go

5216
07:55:25,979 --> 07:55:31,580
Succomius, thanks for the thousand bits order pizza on stream right now. No, no pizza. I need to eat the healthy

5217
07:55:32,380 --> 07:55:34,909
Tingey, thanks for the 250

5218
07:55:34,909 --> 07:55:40,029
Hello jeremy, uh burkey gaming here to remind you to stay hydrated with some refreshing burkey filtered water

5219
07:55:40,029 --> 07:55:44,700
The purest and best tasting way to hydrate. Thanks tingey sad vega. Thanks for the 250

5220
07:55:44,700 --> 07:55:49,740
You can choose any fictional hero or villain and you resort to dinky brained comics

5221
07:55:50,299 --> 07:55:54,459
When we talked about who's the best superhero?

5222
07:55:59,400 --> 07:56:02,759
Any fictional hero or villain and you did dinky brain comics

5223
07:56:04,840 --> 07:56:06,279
What what?

5224
07:56:06,279 --> 07:56:09,000
What are the heroes and villains are that besides superheroes?

5225
07:56:14,110 --> 07:56:20,810
any fictional hero harry potter

5226
07:56:21,430 --> 07:56:24,040
Mario

5227
07:56:24,040 --> 07:56:29,130
Is mario a superhero?

5228
07:56:29,130 --> 07:56:31,560
I mean, I kind of I guess

5229
07:56:33,159 --> 07:56:37,770
What does that make luigi then?

5230
07:56:37,849 --> 07:56:39,849
Does luigi have any superpowers?

5231
07:56:39,849 --> 07:56:44,220
He's a loser

5232
07:56:44,220 --> 07:56:51,470
A sidekick. I mean luigi can jump high too though. Can he?

5233
07:56:57,919 --> 07:56:58,880
Never, okay

5234
07:56:58,880 --> 07:57:04,080
Um, if mario got into a fight with spider-man spider-man would beat the ever-living shit out of mario

5235
07:57:06,360 --> 07:57:08,840
Like if iron man and super mario got in a fight

5236
07:57:09,400 --> 07:57:11,560
Mario's dead in less than five seconds

5237
07:57:12,430 --> 07:57:14,430
Like dead fucking instantly

5238
07:57:19,020 --> 07:57:22,619
Oh, so like luigi can take on thanos apparently

5239
07:57:25,389 --> 07:57:28,750
the guy that walks into a ghost mansion

5240
07:57:29,470 --> 07:57:31,470
and goes

5241
07:57:31,549 --> 07:57:32,750
Ah

5242
07:57:32,750 --> 07:57:38,750
And is scared of little kids ghosts and as a vacuum cleaner can beat up spider-man

5243
07:57:40,159 --> 07:57:53,630
Am I actually hearing this?

5244
07:57:53,630 --> 07:57:56,959
He's so mad

5245
07:57:56,959 --> 07:57:58,959
Like you aren't afraid of ghosts

5246
07:57:59,200 --> 07:58:00,880
um, but

5247
07:58:00,880 --> 07:58:04,360
If you're a superhero

5248
07:58:04,360 --> 07:58:07,479
You don't he's not a superhero. He's like a fun. Cool

5249
07:58:08,259 --> 07:58:10,259
interesting guy that jumps high

5250
07:58:11,840 --> 07:58:13,119
and

5251
07:58:13,119 --> 07:58:15,119
Spider-man would beat the shit out of him

5252
07:58:18,139 --> 07:58:22,319
Spider-man would just have to like and over his mouth and he'd be like

5253
07:58:25,950 --> 07:58:28,750
And then spider-man would just do a roundhouse kick to his head his head would explode

5254
07:58:29,549 --> 07:58:31,549
That's what happens. This is what would happen

5255
07:58:36,240 --> 07:58:38,479
He's like fucking four feet tall

5256
07:58:47,930 --> 07:58:49,930
They have too many lives

5257
07:58:58,319 --> 07:59:00,319
This is a playground argument

5258
07:59:09,209 --> 07:59:10,810
Luigi would use his

5259
07:59:10,810 --> 07:59:17,819
spider-man is

5260
07:59:17,819 --> 07:59:21,419
This is yeah, i'm thinking about yeah, it's a playground argument. Fuck it. We're out here

5261
07:59:22,380 --> 07:59:24,380
a sad vega thanks for the

5262
07:59:25,069 --> 07:59:26,889
250 again

5263
07:59:26,889 --> 07:59:31,209
They say also happy new year's I didn't get a chance to say it at new year's because I didn't want to keep you longer

5264
07:59:32,009 --> 07:59:36,569
And you were gonna be late. Just know that the reason we donate so much is because we know you will do so much amazing things

5265
07:59:37,130 --> 07:59:39,759
That we don't see anywhere else

5266
07:59:39,759 --> 07:59:42,639
I've actually had a couple of meetings over the last week

5267
07:59:43,520 --> 07:59:45,240
There's some

5268
07:59:45,240 --> 07:59:48,439
crazy shit

5269
07:59:48,439 --> 07:59:52,919
There's some fucked up shit that's gonna be happening that will rival the carnival

5270
07:59:53,919 --> 07:59:55,919
That's happening this year

5271
07:59:55,919 --> 08:00:00,970
And when I it it might even be bigger than the carnival in regards to scope

5272
08:00:02,000 --> 08:00:07,040
It's gonna be fucking wild. I cannot wait until I get to really start to work on it

5273
08:00:16,750 --> 08:00:19,310
It is it is not not carnival related

5274
08:00:19,950 --> 08:00:25,240
But it's in that same scope

5275
08:00:25,319 --> 08:00:28,040
And it's not even off the ground yet, but I know it will be

5276
08:00:28,680 --> 08:00:31,819
It's gonna be a lot of fun

5277
08:00:31,819 --> 08:00:33,819
But yeah, happy new year to you as well. Thank you

5278
08:00:35,759 --> 08:00:40,080
Uh, yeah jack up. Thanks for the thousand bits germa say i'm the joker baby

08:00:42,919 --> 08:00:46,439
I don't know why you want me to do that. But thank you though. Thank you bob boy for the 1500 bits

5281
08:00:46,439 --> 08:00:49,159
Please play through half-life series in preparation for half-life alex

5282
08:00:49,799 --> 08:00:51,000

08:00:51,000 --> 08:00:53,799
Half-life one play on easy no joke the game could be too hard

5284
08:00:55,759 --> 08:00:57,279
I've played half-life

5285
08:00:57,279 --> 08:01:03,529
Before and the other difficulties. I think i'll be all right. I beat dusk on the hardest differ. I'll be all right

5286
08:01:04,169 --> 08:01:07,180
Thank you bob boy though for the 1500

5287
08:01:10,169 --> 08:01:13,130
Also, we're gonna do the end of a few days ago and then we can move on to today

5288
08:01:14,650 --> 08:01:20,090
25 dr. Pepper. Thanks for the 250 sure coke gaming is cool. But what about dr. Pepper gaming? You'll be our next sponsor

5289
08:01:20,569 --> 08:01:22,569
Also, are you planning on playing resident evil 3?

5290
08:01:23,680 --> 08:01:25,680
When the new one comes out? Yeah

5291
08:01:25,740 --> 08:01:27,759
Absolutely

5292
08:01:27,759 --> 08:01:33,200
I don't think dr. Pepper has anything to do with games or sponsors or anything. They're kind of they just kind of do their own thing

5293
08:01:36,240 --> 08:01:38,240
They just they do their own thing. They don't really

5294
08:01:38,880 --> 08:01:40,639
I don't think they're involved anywhere

5295
08:01:40,639 --> 08:01:45,229
You know what i'm saying?

5296
08:01:45,229 --> 08:01:50,029
But anyways, thank you to celestial ogia or logia for the 500 bits

5297
08:01:50,590 --> 08:01:52,430
I want to say thank you jeremy

5298
08:01:52,430 --> 08:01:56,189
I had the fortune to catch an upload of your new year's eve stream the other day

5299
08:01:56,750 --> 08:02:02,590
And while you've made me laugh my face off plenty of times in recent years. It was really your offense authenticity that charmed me

5300
08:02:03,389 --> 08:02:07,869
Well, you've been a joy to me in this chapter of my life. I'm even happier that you've been a joy to so many others

5301
08:02:08,509 --> 08:02:11,069
Thanks for being so mindful of other people's words

5302
08:02:11,869 --> 08:02:17,069
I never had a brother but i'm happy to think of you as mine take care of yourself and goodbye

5303
08:02:18,110 --> 08:02:30,860
It was really sweet. It's the first time i've ever been called somebody's brother and not

5304
08:02:32,619 --> 08:02:34,619
Their grandfather

5305
08:02:34,619 --> 08:02:39,319
Or their weird like scary uncle. So thanks for that

5306
08:02:45,000 --> 08:02:48,009
Thanks

5307
08:02:48,009 --> 08:02:49,770
Really appreciate it

5308
08:02:49,770 --> 08:02:53,450
Hey gnarly. Thanks for the 250. Sorry about talking about katana zero for like the 20th time

5309
08:02:53,450 --> 08:02:57,369
But I saw it on the pole in the pre-stream chat. I hope you end up playing it. It's good

5310
08:02:58,330 --> 08:03:01,689
That's the plan this week. I'm probably gonna play it before uh next week

5311
08:03:03,150 --> 08:03:07,150
Apple shift. Thanks for 250. Hey, do you have a set date for the next community content night? No, I don't

5312
08:03:07,950 --> 08:03:11,450
But let's take a look at the calendar might as well do it now

5313
08:03:15,229 --> 08:03:17,450
so

5314
08:03:17,450 --> 08:03:24,169
two three

5315
08:03:25,130 --> 08:03:28,330
Ladies and gentlemen, the next community content night is going to be

5316
08:03:29,130 --> 08:03:33,159
on saturday the 18th

5317
08:03:33,159 --> 08:03:36,380
There you go

5318
08:03:36,380 --> 08:03:39,419
Figured because I did say I want to do it the first and this first and second week

5319
08:03:40,619 --> 08:03:47,099
Somewhere into mid january. So that makes sense on the 18th. We'll do the uh, the next uh string of community content stuff

5320
08:03:47,740 --> 08:03:49,639
and then hopefully soon

5321
08:03:49,639 --> 08:03:51,560
uh, I can get

5322
08:03:51,560 --> 08:03:54,439
my shit taken care of so I can not be a

5323
08:03:55,790 --> 08:04:00,750
Broken body piece of shit and actually be able to get in front of the green screen and move around a lot

5324
08:04:02,909 --> 08:04:04,750
uh my old

5325
08:04:04,750 --> 08:04:06,360
body

5326
08:04:06,360 --> 08:04:10,279
Actually, I went to the memory. I told you I went to the doctor that was a specialist

5327
08:04:11,880 --> 08:04:13,930
and

5328
08:04:13,930 --> 08:04:16,009
we're probably gonna have to do

5329
08:04:17,290 --> 08:04:18,569
a

5330
08:04:18,569 --> 08:04:20,569
nerve blocking injection

5331
08:04:22,810 --> 08:04:25,419
Is what I was told

5332
08:04:25,419 --> 08:04:29,439
Because he he was under the assumption. He's like, I think you do have costochondritis

5333
08:04:30,380 --> 08:04:32,860
And there's not really much anybody can do for it

5334
08:04:33,580 --> 08:04:35,020
besides

5335
08:04:35,020 --> 08:04:40,459
doing steroid injections

5336
08:04:40,520 --> 08:04:43,959
apparently

5337
08:04:43,959 --> 08:04:49,200
Those of you that have no idea what's going on what i'm talking about. Um, I have a hiatal hernia

5338
08:04:50,159 --> 08:04:52,799
but every doctor I talked to said that they don't think that's

5339
08:04:53,439 --> 08:04:55,759
Really the reason why i'm in like pain all the time

5340
08:04:56,400 --> 08:05:00,400
They think it's because I have costochondritis, which is inflammation in your rib cage

5341
08:05:01,119 --> 08:05:05,759
In the joints that connect your chest and your back, you know, like where your ribs connect to your spine

5342
08:05:06,959 --> 08:05:09,599
And where your ribs actually your breastbone connects to your rib cage

5343
08:05:10,560 --> 08:05:13,520
Apparently there's inflammation in there and there's not much that can really be done

5344
08:05:14,319 --> 08:05:16,159
so, um

5345
08:05:16,159 --> 08:05:20,639
If that is the complete and total diagnosis from two or three different doctors

5346
08:05:22,349 --> 08:05:28,509
That you do injections you do steroid injections and sometimes you do like a nerve blocking steroid injection and it goes away forever

5347
08:05:29,150 --> 08:05:31,470
We'll see. How does it happen? Nobody knows

5348
08:05:32,830 --> 08:05:34,830
uh hereditary

5349
08:05:35,950 --> 08:05:38,509
Is just kind of just one of those things. It's just inflammation. I also have

5350
08:05:39,549 --> 08:05:43,150
You guys know, I mean apparently it's an autoimmune bullshit, right?

5351
08:05:43,950 --> 08:05:46,750
Because I have and i've been diagnosed with in the past

5352
08:05:47,770 --> 08:05:49,770
colitis and

5353
08:05:50,479 --> 08:05:51,919
the

5354
08:05:51,919 --> 08:05:55,279
inflammatory bowel disease shit and that's also autoimmune so

5355
08:05:56,560 --> 08:05:58,700
it's

5356
08:05:58,700 --> 08:06:04,939
Essentially, he said you probably have costochondritis because it's autoimmune and you already have autoimmune problems in the first place. So

5357
08:06:05,740 --> 08:06:07,979
There you go

5358
08:06:07,979 --> 08:06:11,930
for those of you that don't know what's what i'm talking about and what it means is

5359
08:06:12,729 --> 08:06:14,729
I don't my range of motion is

5360
08:06:14,729 --> 08:06:18,409
Limited tilting hurts bending over hurts

5361
08:06:19,049 --> 08:06:20,650
Leading backwards hurts

5362
08:06:20,650 --> 08:06:22,810
Um, and when I fell down in the chair on new year's eve

5363
08:06:23,770 --> 08:06:28,330
It was okay. Uh, the next day, uh, my chest was like in a ton of pain

5364
08:06:29,450 --> 08:06:31,450
Like I actually was like

5365
08:06:32,490 --> 08:06:36,240
Like the next fucking day

5366
08:06:36,240 --> 08:06:38,240
The ultimate fall joke

5367
08:06:38,830 --> 08:06:40,729
That wasn't a joke

5368
08:06:40,729 --> 08:06:45,049
But we'll move on we don't have to talk about it. Uh, i'm fine. I'm gonna be good to go

5369
08:06:46,009 --> 08:06:50,330
And I just have to do one more test and then maybe we'll be

5370
08:06:52,250 --> 08:06:54,250
Sticking a needle in my rib cage

5371
08:06:56,240 --> 08:06:59,040
Sounds weird. Okay, but anyways, we'll go

5372
08:07:00,090 --> 08:07:04,729
Locchio locchio. Thanks for the five dollars total if you stop playing this game right now. I'll give you the rest of my bits

5373
08:07:05,450 --> 08:07:13,040
Thanks for honoring my bits. Here's the rest of them. I did do that. You're right and that catches us up to now

5374
08:07:13,840 --> 08:07:16,840
Which we can go back

5375
08:07:16,919 --> 08:07:19,479
Let's go go go right here actually, it's not very much

5376
08:07:20,200 --> 08:07:23,580
We'll get through this pretty quickly

5377
08:07:23,580 --> 08:07:25,740
We had what did we have? What did we have?

5378
08:07:26,299 --> 08:07:29,290
today

5379
08:07:29,290 --> 08:07:31,290
I was just turned on the cam which would have been bad

5380
08:07:33,020 --> 08:07:42,119
Let's do this one. Let's go back to earlier this afternoon. We had 250 from peaceful hailey jeremy

5381
08:07:42,919 --> 08:07:45,159
I wanted to ask you what do you do for fun off stream?

5382
08:07:45,799 --> 08:07:47,799
What's a typical germa day?

5383
08:07:49,159 --> 08:07:51,159
Um pretty boring actually

5384
08:07:54,169 --> 08:07:56,729
grocery shopping

5385
08:07:56,729 --> 08:08:00,490
Do errands I get stuff for the next streams

5386
08:08:01,369 --> 08:08:06,240
You know most of the stuff that you see that just appears on streams randomly or things that I get are things that I do

5387
08:08:06,319 --> 08:08:08,720
It's usually set up a day or two before I stream

5388
08:08:11,319 --> 08:08:13,869
uh

5389
08:08:13,869 --> 08:08:15,639
Go to the dinner

5390
08:08:15,639 --> 08:08:17,639
You know kim and I will spend time together

5391
08:08:18,279 --> 08:08:22,040
Go see a movie

5392
08:08:22,040 --> 08:08:24,840
Sometimes it's nice just to kind of chill take a bath, you know

5393
08:08:28,509 --> 08:08:31,950
I contrary to maybe some popular belief. I live a pretty

5394
08:08:32,830 --> 08:08:34,270
boring

5395
08:08:34,270 --> 08:08:37,560
Private life

5396
08:08:37,560 --> 08:08:39,560
You know, I take take my dog out

5397
08:08:40,729 --> 08:08:41,930
I eat

5398
08:08:41,930 --> 08:08:46,220
I hang out with my girlfriend

5399
08:08:46,299 --> 08:08:48,299
I don't really do much else

5400
08:08:48,700 --> 08:08:50,700
besides preparing streams

5401
08:08:50,860 --> 08:08:58,560
And I sometimes like, you know go out, you know, if friends are in town or if we want to do something we'll

5402
08:08:59,119 --> 08:09:01,520
Oh, you know today. Well, we're gonna go to the strip today, right?

5403
08:09:01,599 --> 08:09:06,799
We've done I mean kim and I have gone out to the strip where you know downtown vegas a lot of times

5404
08:09:08,319 --> 08:09:11,639
But pretty basic normal stuff

5405
08:09:12,119 --> 08:09:22,400
No, the strip not a strip club another oil change servant. What?

5406
08:09:23,119 --> 08:09:28,479
Zeke thanks for the 250. I turned 22 today and spent my birthday eating microwave dinners and watching your old tf2 videos

5407
08:09:28,639 --> 08:09:30,639
Not like this

5408
08:09:30,720 --> 08:09:34,560
P.s. I know you get this a lot, but your stupid memes have genuinely helped me through stress and shit

5409
08:09:35,040 --> 08:09:37,040
More so than any other internet clown out there

5410
08:09:39,080 --> 08:09:42,119
Well, here's something else that I need to say about that

5411
08:09:43,689 --> 08:09:44,650
is

5412
08:09:44,650 --> 08:09:48,169
Sure, i'm the dude on the camera and i'm the guy that says the lines

5413
08:09:49,290 --> 08:09:56,250
But some of the funniest shit that had has come out of this community has come from people making the memes themselves

5414
08:09:57,369 --> 08:10:00,569
some of the most interesting stuff

5415
08:10:01,759 --> 08:10:06,319
comes from the community and the things that how you interpret the things that I say or how you

5416
08:10:07,119 --> 08:10:09,200
Create something out of something that I do or say

5417
08:10:10,520 --> 08:10:12,090
so

5418
08:10:12,090 --> 08:10:16,270
It's not just me

5419
08:10:16,270 --> 08:10:19,790
You guys come up with a lot of funny shit too based on this community, so

5420
08:10:21,080 --> 08:10:24,729
We should be the streamer

5421
08:10:24,729 --> 08:10:26,729
Jerma, you're the muse though

5422
08:10:30,599 --> 08:10:36,750
Hey potion dweller, thanks for the 250. I know exactly how today is going to go. Okay. Well, let's see

5423
08:10:37,630 --> 08:10:40,990
You will start out a very egotistical yet benevolent god

5424
08:10:41,709 --> 08:10:45,069
Then you'll accidentally kill someone and we'll all go d colon

5425
08:10:45,950 --> 08:10:47,950
Then someone will actually offend you

5426
08:10:48,590 --> 08:10:51,150
And you become a murderous psychopath petty god

5427
08:10:58,590 --> 08:11:04,639
I don't think it was that accurate

5428
08:11:04,639 --> 08:11:06,639
I didn't accidentally kill somebody

5429
08:11:07,209 --> 08:11:10,810
I intentionally killed a few people. I intentionally ate a few people

5430
08:11:12,560 --> 08:11:14,799
I ate that dead guy

5431
08:11:14,799 --> 08:11:16,799
Right, like that wasn't by accident. I

5432
08:11:17,680 --> 08:11:23,520
I ate the dead guy like that was not by accident. It wasn't on

5433
08:11:24,560 --> 08:11:28,400
Remember when he threw the rock at the crowd. Oh, does anybody have that clip?

5434
08:11:30,509 --> 08:11:35,310
Seriously, does anybody have the clip of when he throws the rock into the crowd? It's like

5435
08:11:35,869 --> 08:11:37,389
Fucking hilarious

5436
08:11:37,389 --> 08:11:39,419
Where is it?

5437
08:11:39,419 --> 08:11:43,130
Somebody has to have it

5438
08:11:43,130 --> 08:11:45,130
with the common psycho

5439
08:11:48,319 --> 08:11:53,759
It was so stupid. I was just trying to teach him how to like lift rocks

5440
08:11:55,659 --> 08:11:56,860
There it is

5441
08:11:56,860 --> 08:12:00,220
This is what I want. I need this in my life right now

5442
08:12:02,990 --> 08:12:05,229
No, not this

5443
08:12:05,229 --> 08:12:07,549
This is also funny, but not this one

5444
08:12:09,209 --> 08:12:12,569
Oh my god

5445
08:12:12,569 --> 08:12:16,569
Not this here I still will watch this still I guess this is fucking funny, too

5446
08:12:22,799 --> 08:12:26,889
Hey

5447
08:12:32,919 --> 08:12:38,840
What where's the other one where's the one from all the way here we go jerma's evil son

5448
08:12:39,639 --> 08:12:45,159
Jerma's evil son massacres innocent. Stop working. Hey, you're supposed to be stuck in there

5449
08:12:46,830 --> 08:12:48,830
Hold on. I need this. I

5450
08:12:51,709 --> 08:12:53,709
No, stop just throwing it

5451
08:12:55,119 --> 08:12:57,119
You just broke it

5452
08:12:59,580 --> 08:13:05,099
Where is it he goes with a rock?

5453
08:13:10,799 --> 08:13:15,419
You don't give a fuck man, oh he goes back throws it at the builder

5454
08:13:22,779 --> 08:13:24,779
Right here look at all these people

5455
08:13:30,919 --> 08:13:32,919
Stop

5456
08:13:39,310 --> 08:13:41,310
Stop stop stop it

5457
08:13:41,549 --> 08:13:45,389
He's killing everybody. It's not it. That's not it. Where's he throw the boulder?

5458
08:13:47,259 --> 08:13:53,599
He throws the boulder

5459
08:13:53,840 --> 08:13:56,569
That's not even it

5460
08:13:56,569 --> 08:14:00,330
Where does he he whips the boulder and it hits like 15 people

5461
08:14:02,360 --> 08:14:08,090
Somebody's got it. It's it's right after that. Yeah

5462
08:14:09,799 --> 08:14:13,389
Watch the full video

5463
08:14:13,389 --> 08:14:15,389
It's right there. No, wait, you see

5464
08:14:16,590 --> 08:14:18,590
He cries and he picks a folder

5465
08:14:20,669 --> 08:14:23,549
No, i'll find it some of it. We've lost control. Is that it?

5466
08:14:28,279 --> 08:14:31,159
This is the funniest shit i've seen like at least in 2020

5467
08:14:40,159 --> 08:14:42,720
Yeah, this is but this is by far the funniest thing i've seen in 2020

5468
08:14:43,360 --> 08:14:47,200
It's only been eight days. I know but still it's gonna be hard to top this for now

5469
08:14:47,759 --> 08:14:53,020
What's going on internet? Let's go. It's buffering. What am I buffering?

5470
08:14:53,659 --> 08:14:56,799
stop

5471
08:15:02,189 --> 08:15:04,189
Oh stop stop

5472
08:15:05,069 --> 08:15:07,069
He's looking at his eyes

5473
08:15:07,549 --> 08:15:11,200
Stop

5474
08:15:15,200 --> 08:15:17,439
Why would he do that

5475
08:15:18,319 --> 08:15:20,319
He's crying

5476
08:15:21,200 --> 08:15:23,200
He's looking at his eyes

5477
08:15:29,389 --> 08:15:41,790
You don't do that. Oh, that was so funny. What an absolute psychopath

5478
08:15:45,740 --> 08:15:50,400
Anyways

5479
08:15:50,400 --> 08:15:52,639
Thank you to potion dwellers

5480
08:15:54,240 --> 08:15:56,439
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

5481
08:15:56,439 --> 08:15:59,450
Really appreciate it

5482
08:15:59,450 --> 08:16:01,290
also, we had

5483
08:16:01,290 --> 08:16:03,290
a thousand bits from

5484
08:16:03,770 --> 08:16:06,270
Suck your bus

5485
08:16:06,270 --> 08:16:11,709
And it was watch this on stream where no balls is salty swamp. So this is a great series. What are you talking about?

5486
08:16:12,029 --> 08:16:14,430
I mean, i'm not gonna watch it. It's like a 10 minute video

5487
08:16:15,959 --> 08:16:17,959
That's blordow's cartoon

5488
08:16:18,200 --> 08:16:21,680
It's old

5489
08:16:21,680 --> 08:16:23,040
But it's good

5490
08:16:23,040 --> 08:16:27,439
That's like 15 sick. That's like 16 years old

5491
08:16:30,200 --> 08:16:32,439
I think we've watched it on stream before

5492
08:16:33,000 --> 08:16:37,150
I'm certain we have

5493
08:16:37,150 --> 08:16:41,529
dermalore

5494
08:16:41,529 --> 08:16:43,770
Uh, watch this on stream. Not right now

5495
08:16:44,569 --> 08:16:51,319
No, watch joel's movie. I gotta we're gonna watch public domain movie night. We'll watch a bunch of movies queue them up

5496
08:16:57,500 --> 08:17:00,220
I promise we will watch it. We're gonna do a public domain movie night

5497
08:17:00,860 --> 08:17:09,229
But thank you suck your bus for the thousand bits. Thanks for the 1500 bits from bulbous swag desu

5498
08:17:10,959 --> 08:17:14,400
15 dollars. Thanks a lot for that. I'm so happy. I recommended this game like a billion times

5499
08:17:14,400 --> 08:17:16,400
I used to play it all the time as a kid

5500
08:17:17,470 --> 08:17:19,580
Yeah, it's fantastic

5501
08:17:19,580 --> 08:17:21,580
We'll probably be playing it again tomorrow

5502
08:17:21,900 --> 08:17:25,720
At least for a little while. I feel like there's still a little bit more to see

5503
08:17:26,439 --> 08:17:33,049
We'll see

5504
08:17:33,049 --> 08:17:36,169
Uh trampston gave five community subs. I think I missed it. But thank you trampston

5505
08:17:38,470 --> 08:17:41,770
phylacter lich gave five thousand bits again

5506
08:17:42,889 --> 08:17:44,169
again

5507
08:17:44,169 --> 08:17:48,590
Another 50 dollars name your god larry or we will riot. We'll get a proper name for the cow

5508
08:17:49,310 --> 08:17:54,750
I gotta have to really think about it. I didn't I was gonna say something but I didn't want to just jump on a random

5509
08:17:56,639 --> 08:18:02,139
Name and that's what the name is. No, no, no, I want to think about it. It's not going to be mega milk. Absolutely

5510
08:18:02,139 --> 08:18:04,139
No, sorry guys

5511
08:18:05,360 --> 08:18:08,560
Uh behemoth. Thanks for the 250. I I say it repeated

5512
08:18:09,119 --> 08:18:11,119
repent for being late

5513
08:18:11,200 --> 08:18:15,040
I just said it whatever and now I have to apologize for saying that i'm sorry

5514
08:18:15,040 --> 08:18:18,159
I just said that bulbous swag desu again 1500 bits again

5515
08:18:19,119 --> 08:18:23,209
On top of your 1500 to 30 dollars total here. Thank you bulbous way

5516
08:18:24,490 --> 08:18:28,729
I wasn't able to get this game to work when I tried a few weeks ago, but this tutorial goes on forever

5517
08:18:28,970 --> 08:18:30,009
Yeah

5518
08:18:30,009 --> 08:18:35,520
It is a pain in the ass to get to run on anything over windows 7

5519
08:18:36,240 --> 08:18:40,250
So those of you that want to play this game yourself, just be wary

5520
08:18:41,130 --> 08:18:44,409
It's a absolute mess to get it to run on new computers

5521
08:18:49,630 --> 08:18:51,630
Uh flinsenberg. Thanks for five community subs

5522
08:18:54,569 --> 08:18:57,130
Thank you flinsenberg

5523
08:18:57,130 --> 08:19:02,250
Germa put some chips in f germa put sun chips in f tier. Thanks for the 500 bits

5524
08:19:03,479 --> 08:19:04,520
I did

5525
08:19:04,520 --> 08:19:05,959
I just don't like them

5526
08:19:05,959 --> 08:19:10,759
I prayed I prayed this to you god germa so that you may show us your heavenly gigantic

5527
08:19:13,689 --> 08:19:18,270
Feet it's not what you guys thought it was gonna be also

5528
08:19:18,270 --> 08:19:21,389
Is there a chance that you'll play outer wilds in the future? Yes, it's on the table

5529
08:19:23,639 --> 08:19:25,639
I have a list over here with

5530
08:19:26,439 --> 08:19:31,000
50 plus games at this point that are all gonna get played. It's all early 2020 plans

5531
08:19:31,799 --> 08:19:32,840
So yes

5532
08:19:32,840 --> 08:19:35,279
I will be playing outer wilds. I promise

5533
08:19:38,349 --> 08:19:42,349
Topac thanks for the 250. Happy late new year couldn't send bits for the super late streams

5534
08:19:42,990 --> 08:19:48,029
Now that you're starting early, i'm so glad I can catch them again. It's been a wild four years since that i'm watching your channel

5535
08:19:48,349 --> 08:19:53,389
It's grown like crazy. I'm so happy for you. Keep it up. Everyone watches you for a reason

5536
08:19:54,939 --> 08:19:57,439
I hope so

5537
08:19:57,439 --> 08:19:59,439
All I can say back to you guys is

5538
08:20:00,080 --> 08:20:03,680
As the channel grows i'm gonna try to do more and more things that I wanted to try

5539
08:20:06,479 --> 08:20:08,799
We cross 10 000 fucking subs

5540
08:20:09,360 --> 08:20:14,240
I'm gonna do some shit that I may never have ever been able to do and may never be able to do ever again

5541
08:20:15,200 --> 08:20:18,000
You know i'm saying like i'm i'm I want to try new things

5542
08:20:18,880 --> 08:20:22,400
I promise i'll do even less imagine if I said that

5543
08:20:29,759 --> 08:20:32,110
So yeah

5544
08:20:32,110 --> 08:20:34,110
I'm gonna i'm gonna keep rolling

5545
08:20:34,270 --> 08:20:35,869
We'll see what happens. Right?

5546
08:20:35,869 --> 08:20:42,569
But thank you topac and yes, you can expect the streams to start pulled back where I

5547
08:20:43,450 --> 08:20:45,450
Was a couple months ago

5548
08:20:45,529 --> 08:20:48,090
around 1 to 2 pm pacific time

5549
08:20:50,419 --> 08:20:52,419
indefinitely for the foreseeable future

5550
08:20:53,000 --> 08:20:56,569
How did black and white go? It was very fun. It was a ton of fun

5551
08:20:59,259 --> 08:21:01,340
I told you it was I told you it was gonna be a hit

5552
08:21:03,419 --> 08:21:09,959
Do you remember the first like 20 minutes of the stream? I'm just saying

5553
08:21:17,599 --> 08:21:24,400
There was a lot of resident sleeper next game resident fuck and I told you you resident sleeper in half-life one right now

5554
08:21:25,040 --> 08:21:27,200
And I looked over and there was at least 100 people that were like good

5555
08:21:27,279 --> 08:21:32,139
I would do that for half-life one as well and i'm like fuck. Oh, how do I please this person?

5556
08:21:37,819 --> 08:21:40,380
It really starts to pop off when you get the creatures. Yeah

5557
08:21:48,880 --> 08:21:51,119
But thank you public for the 500 bits

5558
08:21:51,840 --> 08:21:58,090
And watching you as long as I can remember now i'm in my second semester of college and subbed to you for almost 18 months

5559
08:21:58,970 --> 08:22:01,369
Sincerely, thanks for everything. Oh and chat. You're cool, too

5560
08:22:04,490 --> 08:22:06,490
Chat is pretty cool. Yeah, I agree

5561
08:22:06,569 --> 08:22:12,520
Like some you know, sometimes they can resident sleeper of one of the best pc games

5562
08:22:13,319 --> 08:22:14,200
ever

5563
08:22:14,200 --> 08:22:17,259
You know and you know you let it slide

5564
08:22:20,889 --> 08:22:25,450
All right. I may I may have flown off the I may have flown off the handle there

5565
08:22:26,009 --> 08:22:29,130
Uh, this probably isn't the top 10 best pc game ever made

5566
08:22:30,090 --> 08:22:36,009
Um, the series is up there with some of people's most beloved cult classic video games ever made. I probably should have said that

5567
08:22:40,540 --> 08:22:42,220
I mean it might be

5568
08:22:42,220 --> 08:22:44,220
it paved the way for a lot of

5569
08:22:45,319 --> 08:22:48,439
Because lion head made this game and then everybody was like, oh wow

5570
08:22:48,840 --> 08:22:55,080
Having choices and and having powers and having ai control themselves and do weird things and people took it and you know, it was

5571
08:22:56,040 --> 08:23:04,240
It's pretty classic

5572
08:23:04,240 --> 08:23:09,680
Hey bulbous swag, thanks for the 1500 more bits on top of the already 30 you gave

5573
08:23:10,479 --> 08:23:12,479
Thank you bulbous swag. They said get the cow. I did

5574
08:23:13,869 --> 08:23:16,189
Classic doesn't mean good. But in this case it does

5575
08:23:17,069 --> 08:23:21,369
We also have to remember this is almost this is like 20 years old

5576
08:23:22,110 --> 08:23:24,909
It's like a six 15 16 year old game something like that

5577
08:23:25,630 --> 08:23:28,750
Can you imagine what this was like playing this?

5578
08:23:29,389 --> 08:23:33,310
When you could be good or evil and it was one of the first times you could ever do that

5579
08:23:34,540 --> 08:23:38,380
You still got the original box I got the original box too. It's pretty awesome

5580
08:23:40,360 --> 08:23:41,959
Came out in 2001

5581
08:23:41,959 --> 08:23:43,369
right

5582
08:23:43,369 --> 08:23:46,759
See

5583
08:23:46,759 --> 08:23:54,240
Show the box. I don't have any clothes on I can't i'll show it tomorrow. The second one wasn't as good, but it was fun

5584
08:23:55,470 --> 08:23:58,669
Yeah, I feel like we won't be spending as much time in black and white, too

5585
08:24:00,540 --> 08:24:05,950
Maybe like I said, i'm willing to give these games a good full two streams

5586
08:24:06,669 --> 08:24:10,189
I feel like we just opened up everything. So

5587
08:24:13,130 --> 08:24:15,259
Well, yeah, thank you. Pubble

5588
08:24:15,259 --> 08:24:19,340
Thank you for the 18 months in a row of your subscription. Thank you bulbous swag for the 1500

5589
08:24:19,900 --> 08:24:22,459
We did get the cow tar alecran. Thanks for the 250

5590
08:24:23,819 --> 08:24:26,619
The other day in chat people were telling you that bananas were radioactive

5591
08:24:27,180 --> 08:24:29,580
I went along with the bit because I thought it was funny

5592
08:24:29,979 --> 08:24:36,639
But I was watching a science video the other day and it turns out that not only are they radioactive but they reliably produce anti-matter

5593
08:24:37,180 --> 08:24:39,659
the most dangerous and volatile substance in the universe

5594
08:24:40,380 --> 08:24:43,819
On average a single banana will produce a particle of anti-matter every 70 minutes

5595
08:24:44,779 --> 08:24:47,400
This is as horseshit

5596
08:24:49,290 --> 08:24:54,650
You made the whole thing up

5597
08:24:54,650 --> 08:24:56,650
Thanks for the 250 though

5598
08:24:57,779 --> 08:25:08,380
Appreciate it. Look it up. Do I actually have to write this?

5599
08:25:09,689 --> 08:25:14,889
bananas anti-matter

5600
08:25:14,889 --> 08:25:20,279
This is real the average banana rich in potassium produces

5601
08:25:21,299 --> 08:25:31,770
Positron roughly once every 75 minutes. This feels like a fake website

5602
08:25:37,340 --> 08:25:40,299
Okay, the top two sources for this are the same website

5603
08:25:47,000 --> 08:25:54,880
Antimatter particle in bananas. Hold on. Is it maybe it is

5604
08:25:55,520 --> 08:25:58,779
quantum

5605
08:25:58,779 --> 08:26:02,779
Today I learned. Oh, here's reddit today. I learned bananas produce anti-matter. Let's say

5606
08:26:02,779 --> 08:26:07,099
Okay, let's see if somebody in the first comment goes actually you're fucking stupid. Let's see

5607
08:26:07,659 --> 08:26:17,319
Between this and the radiation thing i'm becoming increasingly distrustful of bananas and I really don't need that in my life

5608
08:26:24,200 --> 08:26:27,240
This and the radiation thing are the same thing

5609
08:26:27,799 --> 08:26:34,040
Wow, what a terrible sentence bananas contain potassium a small percentage of all naturally occurring potassium

5610
08:26:34,439 --> 08:26:40,119
Is in the form of potassium 40 potassium 40 decays through all three kinds of beta decay

5611
08:26:40,759 --> 08:26:46,599
Most of it is electron emission some of its electron capture and a tiny percentage is positron emission

5612
08:26:47,080 --> 08:26:49,080
It's a very small

5613
08:26:49,139 --> 08:26:53,319
arguably negligible amount of radiation the banana equivalent dose

5614
08:26:54,729 --> 08:26:56,729
Is 0.1

5615
08:26:57,290 --> 08:27:04,970
Weird usv in contrast you actually receive 10 usv background radiation per day on average

5616
08:27:05,509 --> 08:27:09,529
100 times more than eating a fucking banana. I said that to you guys

5617
08:27:10,490 --> 08:27:17,900
It's three weeks ago. There's this also you need potassium to live

5618
08:27:25,069 --> 08:27:26,919
so, um

5619
08:27:26,919 --> 08:27:31,319
You should be able to add this is a great quote from this fucking scientist. This reddit scientist

5620
08:27:32,349 --> 08:27:33,790
uh

5621
08:27:33,790 --> 08:27:35,950
You should actually keep your banana intake below

5622
08:27:36,490 --> 08:27:38,830
2740 bananas a day

5623
08:27:40,200 --> 08:27:41,400
um

5624
08:27:41,400 --> 08:27:48,680
To get below that radiation limit that you get just from it just existing a day. Okay, so be careful guys

5625
08:27:53,290 --> 08:27:58,270
Make sure you don't eat 3000 bananas a day to get the same radiation that you get by existing

5626
08:27:58,669 --> 08:28:00,669
Just standing in your room for a day

5627
08:28:00,750 --> 08:28:03,069
Like I said go in your basement and breathe in once

5628
08:28:03,869 --> 08:28:07,389
You just ate fucking 5000 bananas. Thank you. I'm so glad that we looked that up

5629
08:28:07,950 --> 08:28:11,290
So glad we got over that

5630
08:28:11,290 --> 08:28:18,889
Where are we here? Okay

5631
08:28:18,889 --> 08:28:20,970
Parasol, thank you parasol for the thousand bits

5632
08:28:22,650 --> 08:28:28,490
Hey jerma, just wanted to drop it and say I truly appreciate you. It's my dream to see you play my own game someday

5633
08:28:29,290 --> 08:28:31,049
until then

5634
08:28:31,049 --> 08:28:32,919
Love you

5635
08:28:32,919 --> 08:28:34,919
Until then though, but what game?

5636
08:28:36,029 --> 08:28:40,729
What game?

5637
08:28:40,729 --> 08:28:42,729
Never trust a redditor. Why not?

5638
08:28:46,119 --> 08:28:48,119
It's a porn game. You'll see

5639
08:28:49,319 --> 08:28:52,200
Thank you parasol for the thousand bits. I don't think it's a porn game

5640
08:28:53,000 --> 08:28:55,319
Come here. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey jerma, i'm pretty late

5641
08:28:55,319 --> 08:28:58,840
But just want to say thanks for the kind words on my xaraxos poster on the content night

5642
08:28:59,560 --> 08:29:04,119
Really made all the work. I put into it worth it. Can't wait for the next one. It was awesome. So thank you

5643
08:29:05,419 --> 08:29:07,020
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

5644
08:29:07,020 --> 08:29:10,479
But he said why not?

5645
08:29:10,479 --> 08:29:12,479
No, I can't play a porn game on stream

5646
08:29:13,200 --> 08:29:16,319
I can't i'm not gonna i'm not gonna play a porn game anyways. Why would I play a porn game?

5647
08:29:19,680 --> 08:29:21,680
Uh, thank you non a

5648
08:29:21,919 --> 08:29:24,319
Ha ar for the 250

5649
08:29:25,119 --> 08:29:29,520
Glad I can once again donate to the best streamer on twitch. I was so happy watching the award stream. You deserve every cent

5650
08:29:30,159 --> 08:29:33,759
Since you took me up on my black and white game recommendation. It was recommended a lot

5651
08:29:34,240 --> 08:29:38,000
So yeah, I told you guys how long till you give it and play dragon rampa probably never

5652
08:29:39,400 --> 08:29:41,000
Like black and white

5653
08:29:41,000 --> 08:29:43,340
This is my jam. You know what I mean?

5654
08:29:43,979 --> 08:29:47,259
I don't think i'll play in one of those. I don't think i'm gonna play dragon rumple

5655
08:29:49,689 --> 08:29:51,689
Probably never i'm just gonna be real

5656
08:29:52,599 --> 08:29:56,599
Stuff like I people say play dragon rompa play doki-doki literature club play

5657
08:29:57,479 --> 08:30:01,319
This game play this. I don't i'm really not into them. I really don't I don't play them

5658
08:30:02,119 --> 08:30:05,319
What's it called? What's it? What's it called?

5659
08:30:06,750 --> 08:30:11,950
Drag was it called?

5660
08:30:11,950 --> 08:30:13,950
dangan dangan ronpa

5661
08:30:16,700 --> 08:30:18,700
What am I saying dragon rompa?

5662
08:30:19,099 --> 08:30:22,380
I I like it that I I say it better that way dangan rompa

5663
08:30:25,840 --> 08:30:28,560
Probably not though. It's not doesn't look like it's up my alley

5664
08:30:36,619 --> 08:30:42,139
Hey invader z thanks to the 250. Hey jerem. I was wondering when the next community content night is

5665
08:30:43,689 --> 08:30:44,729
uh

5666
08:30:44,729 --> 08:30:45,849
18th

5667
08:30:45,849 --> 08:30:50,270
Also, here's a picture of my rats

5668
08:30:52,220 --> 08:30:54,380
Update a picture. You now have four rats

5669
08:30:58,880 --> 08:31:00,880
It's not good. It's actually okay

5670
08:31:02,700 --> 08:31:06,860
What the game?

5671
08:31:06,860 --> 08:31:08,860
Why you got him in why you got him in this bowl?

5672
08:31:10,599 --> 08:31:13,000
You got like rats in like a bowl. Yeah, look

5673
08:31:19,740 --> 08:31:21,740
That's a bowl with four in there

5674
08:31:25,180 --> 08:31:28,060
I know rats actually like to stuff into each other though, don't they?

5675
08:31:35,080 --> 08:31:40,119
I don't rats notoriously like to just get all on top of each other and like stuff on to into each other and stuff

5676
08:31:42,029 --> 08:31:53,080
That's a rat bowl

5677
08:31:53,080 --> 08:31:58,919
German can't say snuggle. Oh, that's true. That is what that is. Don't say it like that. I

5678
08:32:06,040 --> 08:32:08,599
Stuck I I i'm very literal

5679
08:32:09,560 --> 08:32:15,000
Yes cuddling sure. I'm I'm when I say like stuff into each other. I mean like pushing into each other

5680
08:32:15,799 --> 08:32:18,700
Hey kim mom is i'm not gonna read that

5681
08:32:19,740 --> 08:32:22,520
All right. All right. All right

5682
08:32:22,520 --> 08:32:28,680
But i'm talking in terms of like they press into each other and they roll and press and roll around and

5683
08:32:29,479 --> 08:32:37,290
All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done moving on. I gotta get rats

5684
08:32:37,770 --> 08:32:41,369
I want like a lizard too. I want a huge monitor dragon. I want a like a

5685
08:32:42,090 --> 08:32:47,369
Tegu so bad. I want a huge fucking lizard, but like I can't it's just not it's too much

5686
08:32:48,009 --> 08:32:50,009
Hey for raisin

5687
08:32:50,490 --> 08:32:52,009

5691
08:33:07,130 --> 08:33:09,770
Well, you can't even give one cent uh, 25 cents

5692
08:33:11,069 --> 08:33:16,029
Or 25 000 bits. I if you give money to this channel, don't ever think that this is all this is no

5693
08:33:16,110 --> 08:33:18,349
This is all I can give you for now

5694
08:33:18,349 --> 08:33:20,349
Don't feel obligated to give me money

5695
08:33:21,849 --> 08:33:23,849
Thank you for ever even considering it

5696
08:33:27,439 --> 08:33:29,439
Thank you for the thousand bits

08:33:34,479 --> 08:33:37,439
Getting to the end here we have let's get the credits on by the way

Roll them up there and they come. Thanks all the subs everybody. There's a there are a lot of you now, you know the number

5699
08:33:47,610 --> 08:33:50,810
You know the number of how many people are subbed to this channel

5700
08:33:51,610 --> 08:33:53,610
It's an insane amount of people

5701
08:33:54,400 --> 08:33:55,950
it's

5702
08:33:55,950 --> 08:33:58,830
More than I ever thought that this channel would ever have ever

5703
08:33:59,900 --> 08:34:02,779
so

5704
08:34:02,779 --> 08:34:06,459
Thank you all of you

5705
08:34:06,459 --> 08:34:10,540
Regardless of I know it's a lot of gifted and community subs from new years

5706
08:34:11,259 --> 08:34:13,900
And if regardless if you stick around or not

5707
08:34:14,939 --> 08:34:21,819
This number here is fucking over 10 000 subs is fucking ridiculous. It's absolutely insane

5708
08:34:22,540 --> 08:34:27,840
I hope I use your money. Well

5709
08:34:27,840 --> 08:34:30,759
I plan to

5710
08:34:30,759 --> 08:34:32,759
next goal 20 000 subs

5711
08:34:33,400 --> 08:34:36,680
I don't know about that. That's uh, that's

5712
08:34:43,919 --> 08:34:45,919
At some point I at some point

5713
08:34:46,560 --> 08:34:50,479
You make a movie, you know what I mean? Like that's that's an absolute dick

5714
08:34:50,720 --> 08:34:52,720
That's an absolute shitload of money

5715
08:34:55,439 --> 08:34:59,439
You know at some point you hire danny to veto to fucking like come on streaming like throw an egg at me

5716
08:35:05,360 --> 08:35:08,959
You said dick. I was uh, this is just you know what I mean?

5717
08:35:10,860 --> 08:35:16,299
But regardless of where that number goes up or down. Seriously, it's we crossed the threshold here that

5718
08:35:17,790 --> 08:35:19,790
It seems impossible to cross

5719
08:35:21,470 --> 08:35:26,330
Thanks again guys. There's still a few more bits to do we have uh

5720
08:35:27,270 --> 08:35:29,439
mozzie connie

5721
08:35:29,520 --> 08:35:31,759
Mozzie connie for the mozzie connie

08:35:37,759 --> 08:35:39,759
Seriously, it's a lot of money

5724
08:35:40,159 --> 08:35:43,159
Hey, germa got some bad news about my cat today

5725
08:35:43,720 --> 08:35:47,880
But your stream has been making it easier to cope just wanted to thank you for making everything a little easier

5726
08:35:49,130 --> 08:35:51,310
Whatever that news is

5727
08:35:51,389 --> 08:35:57,880
I'm hope you get through it. Thanks for the thousand bits. Thanks for sticking around

5728
08:35:58,779 --> 08:36:00,779
Uh, it's it's my pleasure to have you around

5729
08:36:08,720 --> 08:36:10,560
Sorry about the bad news

5730
08:36:10,560 --> 08:36:13,759
Whatever it is

5731
08:36:13,759 --> 08:36:18,909
Moving on to four real dough for 250

5732
08:36:19,959 --> 08:36:23,880
Is there a specific guide you use to get this game working? If yes, can we get a link to it?

5733
08:36:25,279 --> 08:36:29,119
Uh, okay. Let me go through the process here because it was weird

5734
08:36:30,000 --> 08:36:31,680
so

5735
08:36:31,680 --> 08:36:33,740
There is

5736
08:36:33,740 --> 08:36:35,500
This is an original cd

5737
08:36:35,500 --> 08:36:37,500
So it's black and white just the game

5738
08:36:38,299 --> 08:36:40,299
The original game no expansions or anything

5739
08:36:41,259 --> 08:36:47,229
And it I installed it I do I did not run it with compatibility mode. I just installed the game

5740
08:36:49,950 --> 08:36:53,709
Yeah, go to pc gaming wiki. That's a great place to do it. There is a fan patch

5741
08:36:54,860 --> 08:36:57,759
Because version the game patched up to version 1.3

5742
08:36:58,860 --> 08:37:04,240
I think is where the game officially ended and then some fans made a 1.4

5743
08:37:05,180 --> 08:37:10,299
And it fixed a bunch of the bugs and made it I think run better or run on um on newer hardware

5744
08:37:10,700 --> 08:37:15,020
Because I tried to run this game without the fan patch and it didn't work it crashed a desktop every single time

5745
08:37:17,360 --> 08:37:21,599
Yeah, bwf, uh, yeah bwf files windows 10. Yeah

5746
08:37:24,119 --> 08:37:26,200
I think there's at least a couple of guides on that website, too

5747
08:37:26,759 --> 08:37:29,799
But you you have to have that especially if you have windows 10

5748
08:37:30,439 --> 08:37:33,959
You have to have that 1.43 or 1.42. Whatever it is

5749
08:37:35,720 --> 08:37:37,240
Fan patch

5750
08:37:37,240 --> 08:37:41,159
And we've had a crash maybe once or twice and had a little scare about the save game

5751
08:37:41,159 --> 08:37:43,159
But for the most part it's been running

5752
08:37:43,959 --> 08:37:45,959
I would say flawlessly at this point

5753
08:37:48,490 --> 08:37:50,490
Uh, you also might have to get a dll, too

5754
08:37:53,770 --> 08:37:55,770
But cross that bridge when you need to

5755
08:37:56,250 --> 08:38:04,970
But that fan patch will help you. It's the only way to install black and white legit

5756
08:38:08,520 --> 08:38:16,799
big crash

5757
08:38:16,799 --> 08:38:18,560
I you know, okay

5758
08:38:18,560 --> 08:38:24,479
This is like this is funny to me, but also like I can't believe it. We're still arguing about oil changes right now

5759
08:38:30,650 --> 08:38:32,650
But I mean the others but I like

5760
08:38:33,610 --> 08:38:35,610
Somebody's saying it's a mess. It's a pain

5761
08:38:36,250 --> 08:38:41,770
I i'd rather just have somebody else do it. My time is valuable to me. You know what I mean? Like I

5762
08:38:43,310 --> 08:38:46,779
We're still going on that

5763
08:38:46,779 --> 08:38:48,779
Does luigi change his own oil?

5764
08:38:51,520 --> 08:39:03,209
Luigi probably can't even change his own diaper guys. Why am I so mean to a luigi?

5765
08:39:03,290 --> 08:39:05,290
Anybody why would I be this mean to luigi?

5766
08:39:08,669 --> 08:39:10,669
Jen ski flower. Thanks for the 300 bits

5767
08:39:11,549 --> 08:39:15,069
Hey jerma, i'm really glad you're playing black and white. It's one of my favorite childhood games

5768
08:39:15,389 --> 08:39:18,509
And when I bring it up everyone thinks i'm talking about pokemon black and white

5769
08:39:19,150 --> 08:39:22,439
I hope your doctor's appointment went well and you're feeling better from your illness

5770
08:39:22,919 --> 08:39:27,560
Or at least doing better than I am since i'm having an allergic reaction to my hair dye

5771
08:39:28,040 --> 08:39:30,599
And have sore itchy scabs all over my scalp

5772
08:39:31,790 --> 08:39:33,869
Holy shit, that's doesn't sound fun

5773
08:39:35,740 --> 08:39:38,540
And if you're not you better get some rest you toasted walnut

5774
08:39:40,880 --> 08:39:43,020
Yeah, i'm feeling all right

5775
08:39:43,020 --> 08:39:48,139
I I was coming down from my actual I had a head cold over the last few days and i'm feeling okay now

5776
08:39:48,380 --> 08:39:50,380
I'll probably be 100 better tomorrow

5777
08:39:51,020 --> 08:39:54,590
We can keep going

5778
08:39:54,590 --> 08:39:56,669
But thank you, uh jenski flower for the 300 bits

5779
08:39:58,840 --> 08:40:02,840
Mini clips. Thanks for 500 bits. What do you call a cow with no legs a ground beef?

5780
08:40:07,049 --> 08:40:11,689
Thank you bulbous swag again for five more dollars here. Just wanted to round up my bits for the night

5781
08:40:12,650 --> 08:40:14,810
But I gotta say you're a cruel and vengeful god

5782
08:40:20,990 --> 08:40:22,990
Uh, is it me? That's cruel

5783
08:40:23,310 --> 08:40:27,150
I keep thinking okay

5784
08:40:27,150 --> 08:40:29,150
Fuck, what did I think of this morning?

5785
08:40:30,509 --> 08:40:32,669
I was in bed this morning

5786
08:40:33,880 --> 08:40:37,799
And I started laughing just laughing really hard at something

5787
08:40:39,130 --> 08:40:40,830
What was it?

5788
08:40:40,830 --> 08:40:44,270
It was something random that I thought you guys would think was funny

5789
08:40:44,909 --> 08:40:49,709
I was in bed rolling around. You know when you get lost in your thoughts and you're in that half sleep

5790
08:40:52,189 --> 08:40:54,189
And you're not dreaming

5791
08:40:54,349 --> 08:41:00,590
But your imagination becomes way vivid way more interesting and way more vivid when you're in that halfway point

5792
08:41:02,569 --> 08:41:07,450
Something stream related happened that I remembered and I just started cracking up

5793
08:41:08,729 --> 08:41:12,080
Uh, what the hell was it? This is gonna happen though

5794
08:41:12,720 --> 08:41:18,080
I'm gonna randomly see in that half sleep the cow throwing the rocket though with those people and i'm gonna start cracking up

5795
08:41:20,119 --> 08:41:25,720
It's inevitable

5796
08:41:25,720 --> 08:41:27,720
That's so oh i'm so

5797
08:41:28,119 --> 08:41:32,119
I love this cow and if it wasn't the cow if it was going to be the the ape

5798
08:41:32,439 --> 08:41:37,479
The ape probably wouldn't have done that. I don't think so the cow like sucks. So I don't think the ape would have done it

5799
08:41:38,360 --> 08:41:42,520
I love this cow. We got to rescue him. Don't you understand? We have to rescue him

5800
08:41:43,240 --> 08:41:44,520
he's being

5801
08:41:44,520 --> 08:41:53,950
Captured and tortured right now. We have to get him. Thank you bulbous work tangent. Thanks for the five community subs tangent

5802
08:41:55,080 --> 08:41:59,240
The pc int thanks for 300 bits germa. It's not your fault, but my username

5803
08:41:59,720 --> 08:42:02,439
Is the point but the o is a c

5804
08:42:04,459 --> 08:42:06,459
Lol, the point was taken

5805
08:42:07,819 --> 08:42:09,819
Oh, so it's not the pc int

5806
08:42:11,119 --> 08:42:13,819
It's the point

5807
08:42:13,819 --> 08:42:17,979
I hope you have a good day missed most of the stream seems like it was both chaotic and boring at the same time

5808
08:42:21,869 --> 08:42:26,939
um

5809
08:42:26,939 --> 08:42:31,419
I mean, it's just it's a different type of game. You know, they take a while to do anything interesting

5810
08:42:31,659 --> 08:42:33,819
But when stuff happens it goes fucking crazy

5811
08:42:34,779 --> 08:42:44,479
That's another reason why I want to do this do the tutorial and like try to pay attention to a lot of things

5812
08:42:45,439 --> 08:42:48,009
Just to make anything fun happen in the game

5813
08:42:48,009 --> 08:42:52,970
You really kind of need to know how it works and I didn't want to just blow through it because I could skip the tutorial

5814
08:42:52,970 --> 08:42:54,409
completely

5815
08:42:54,409 --> 08:43:00,729
So I need to continue to learn

5816
08:43:01,369 --> 08:43:04,970
Level three requires you to use all the mechanics germa's been neglecting. It should be good. Yeah

5817
08:43:05,689 --> 08:43:09,159
We'll see the thanks them

5818
08:43:10,680 --> 08:43:15,479
Errorless thanks for the 250 when you're gonna do a collab a collab with uh lil naz

5819
08:43:16,599 --> 08:43:24,750
I don't think that's gonna happen. I i mean i'm flattered i'm flattered if if he likes

5820
08:43:26,830 --> 08:43:28,509
rat movie

5821
08:43:28,509 --> 08:43:31,470
That's where they got it from. I you know what I mean?

5822
08:43:34,349 --> 08:43:36,349
That's uh, it's flattering

5823
08:43:37,799 --> 08:43:39,080
uh

5824
08:43:39,080 --> 08:43:41,479
Just dm him and say you're the giant rat guy

5825
08:43:42,810 --> 08:43:44,810
I don't know if I want to do that

5826
08:43:44,810 --> 08:43:49,610
Hey, hey, i'm the giant rat guy. Hey, you you you tweeted that i'm the giant rat guy. It's me

5827
08:43:50,169 --> 08:43:52,650
You ret you tweeted something out with giant rat. I'm that guy

5828
08:43:53,740 --> 08:43:56,779
That's a little that's that kind of grasping. I don't i'm not into that

5829
08:43:59,520 --> 08:44:01,119
That's just cool that

5830
08:44:01,119 --> 08:44:07,869
He may have seen the video. That's just cool. I don't need nothing. I don't need anything else. No, that's enough for me

5831
08:44:09,369 --> 08:44:11,369
But you know if he did

5832
08:44:11,849 --> 08:44:13,709
If he was like, hey

5833
08:44:13,709 --> 08:44:17,310
Giant rat was really awesome. I'd be like that's me. I'm that guy

5834
08:44:18,110 --> 08:44:30,830
Uh, that's just cool. And that's all there is to it high tie. Thanks for the 1500 bits

5835
08:44:31,930 --> 08:44:36,729
$15 thanks a lot. This is my way of saying thank you. I've been watching your videos for over five years

5836
08:44:37,349 --> 08:44:41,610
Specifically starting with the pin cushion experiment. That was a that was a good one

5837
08:44:42,569 --> 08:44:48,409
You continue to be the funniest entertainer out there and I can never make up the countless hours of entertainment you've provided

5838
08:44:49,369 --> 08:44:53,959
Thanks man, I wish I'd been watching you for five years

5839
08:44:56,569 --> 08:45:00,650
Well, you you got five years from now, you'll be you'll five years from now

5840
08:45:00,650 --> 08:45:06,650
You'll look back and be like, oh, remember that was pretty fucking cool. Remember when the cow threw the rock at those people

5841
08:45:07,529 --> 08:45:12,650
your story

5842
08:45:12,650 --> 08:45:14,009
Begins now

5843
08:45:14,009 --> 08:45:18,169
But seriously high tide. Thank you

5844
08:45:18,889 --> 08:45:20,889
Thanks for allowing me to be able to do something like this

5845
08:45:22,060 --> 08:45:26,700
And wake up every day and go what do I want to try to do today that that might be fun

5846
08:45:29,279 --> 08:45:35,799
People like you allow me to do that. So thank you. Finally, we have a couple more we have kerbumble for 300 bits

5847
08:45:36,680 --> 08:45:42,040
We have for real dough for 250. I enjoyed the stream drummer. Here's to hoping this game and the sequel get a digital release

5848
08:45:42,900 --> 08:45:47,319
Re-release or a decent spiritual successor. That's something that I wish they already existed

5849
08:45:49,290 --> 08:45:51,049
If you took black and white

5850
08:45:51,049 --> 08:45:53,930
one and two and just remade it as just

5851
08:45:54,569 --> 08:45:56,569
Just remake it just black and white

5852
08:45:57,049 --> 08:46:02,729
Remake some of the systems take away some of the potentially more grindy frustrating systems that are in the game and put a bunch

5853
08:46:02,810 --> 08:46:05,290
New creatures in make the ai crazier

5854
08:46:06,250 --> 08:46:08,250
People would eat this up so much

5855
08:46:08,729 --> 08:46:13,610
But not very many people not many people know it exists and people that do know it exists

5856
08:46:13,849 --> 08:46:16,409
Can barely play it because it's hard to get to run

5857
08:46:20,439 --> 08:46:23,159
Mike it's microsoft microsoft is sitting on all this shit

5858
08:46:23,700 --> 08:46:26,360
Microsoft owns all these assets like what get on it

5859
08:46:32,560 --> 08:46:35,680
That microsoft owns all the all the lion head ip, right?

5860
08:46:40,490 --> 08:46:41,610
like

5861
08:46:41,610 --> 08:46:44,569
There's so much interesting shit that they could do with some of these lion head ips

5862
08:46:49,740 --> 08:46:51,419
ea owns it

5863
08:46:51,419 --> 08:46:53,819
I thought lion head was absorbed by

5864
08:46:54,540 --> 08:46:55,659
microsoft

5865
08:46:55,659 --> 08:46:58,669
Yeah, I thought so. It's ea. What?

5866
08:47:06,299 --> 08:47:14,110
Seriously

5867
08:47:14,110 --> 08:47:17,389
That's even worse. Yeah, that's that is that is kind of worse

5868
08:47:20,319 --> 08:47:24,000
I thought I always thought that it was it came with the absorption of all of lion head

5869
08:47:26,029 --> 08:47:30,569
Hmm. Well, oh well send it to bed then

5870
08:47:31,849 --> 08:47:33,689
Because that ain't coming back

5871
08:47:33,689 --> 08:47:37,049
Uh e cookie. Thanks for the 250 and our final bit of the night. Hey germa

5872
08:47:37,049 --> 08:47:41,930
I'm a veterinarian by trade and specialize in small rodents like rats mice and hamsters

5873
08:47:42,729 --> 08:47:47,759
All right. Let's get some info here for rats. They do actually enjoy being put in small piles with other rats

5874
08:47:47,919 --> 08:47:49,279
Like yeah, right

5875
08:47:49,279 --> 08:47:53,040
If I have a if I have a particularly anxious rat

5876
08:47:53,680 --> 08:48:00,479
I will place him with four or five other rats in a bowl then put that into a deep fryer you motherfucker

5877
08:48:01,520 --> 08:48:03,840
Right. Okay. Thanks veterinarian

5878
08:48:05,529 --> 08:48:07,689
Thanks the fucking fake veterinarian

5879
08:48:08,490 --> 08:48:15,790
That's the last bit of the night

5880
08:48:15,869 --> 08:48:23,500
I'll see you guys tomorrow for more black and white potentially. Well, we might do a split stream tomorrow

5881
08:48:24,380 --> 08:48:27,900
We might play black and white for a couple hours and then move on to like katana zero

5882
08:48:28,619 --> 08:48:31,900
Or maybe we get addicted and I just stay on it like I did today for like eight hours

5883
08:48:33,099 --> 08:48:34,799
See you guys soon

5884
08:48:34,799 --> 08:48:38,669
Have a great rest of your night

5885
08:48:38,669 --> 08:48:40,840

How dare you?

5892
08:49:12,189 --> 08:49:15,069
Uh, yeah, well we could see let's let's raid somebody

5893
08:49:15,950 --> 08:49:18,080
He's streaming right now

5894
08:49:18,080 --> 08:49:23,279
I've been trying to follow more people in ship and try to keep up with because we've gotten some really really

5895
08:49:24,080 --> 08:49:26,080
Great communities. We've had some raids

5896
08:49:26,319 --> 08:49:31,200
The box box has raided the channel like three times with thousands of people

5897
08:49:32,159 --> 08:49:34,159
Uh, we got that right from ludwig

5898
08:49:34,560 --> 08:49:37,360
with three or four thousand people a couple weeks ago

5899
08:49:38,159 --> 08:49:40,459
I really want to try to catch some of these uh

5900
08:49:40,700 --> 08:49:42,700
Some of these people when they're streaming

5901

Right key wall key. Well, yeah, that's where key was streaming right now. Okay, what are you doing?

That video is in a different spot as well. I swear to god like that all my videos have moved

5914
08:50:56,490 --> 08:50:57,930
All right, joe

5915
08:50:57,930 --> 08:51:01,770
Here's the end here comes the end of the stream. All right, I don't know what this video is. It's not in this folder

5916
08:51:03,049 --> 08:51:07,470
See you tomorrow. Good night. Goodbye. We don't need it out. We don't have no outro
