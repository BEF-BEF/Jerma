1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:09,339
All right, hi. We're gonna move on to another game that I have been sitting on for a while.

2
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:17,929
This is a singing game. It's called One Hand Clapping. You have to sing to play the game?

3
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:36,090
I will find out if it's any good. Checking it out Thursdays. It's down. Just give me one sec.

4
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:55,240
Well, I think I have to calibrate it too. Let's find out. It's Wednesday? Oh, it is Wednesday.

5
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:08,469
Well, okay. Hopefully this can pick up my microphone. All right, I'll be... Give me one

6
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:17,930
sec. It says a microphone is required to play, which I have. Well, what the fuck? Hello? Can

7
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:30,219
you guys hear this? Oh, okay. Use wired headphones? Oh, no. Wait a minute. I'm gonna... Should I mute

8
00:01:31,180 --> 00:02:37,379
This is me muting the actual mic. I'm speech jamming myself as I hear the meter singing.

9
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:48,620
I hear everything. I hear everything. The meter should light up when you sing and turn off when

10
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,919
you apply. Make sure it's not activated by breathing in the background. You guys, you can't... It's

11
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:16,150
not way too damp. I'm delayed though. I think this is fine. I actually have to keep this off.

12
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,659
This is gonna be so stupid. What a terrible screen this is gonna be. I need to get my...

13
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:49,930
It's not like you're giving a speech. I need to delay the webcam by like a tenth of a second.

14
00:03:50,650 --> 00:04:08,229
Actually, this might be... You tell me when it's matched up. Am I matched up? One, two, three.

15
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:22,920
One, two, three. Is that better? Two, three. Turn it up. I mean, it's the game. This is as long as

16
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:39,300
I can go, man. I can't turn the audio up. Maybe I can. Hold on. Two. Sorry. It's gonna... Is this

17
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:50,310
okay? This is not a stream routine. This is not a stream that... This is the game. It's too quiet still.

18
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,639
It's gonna go really fucking loud. It's gonna go really, really loud. Turn your fucking speakers

19
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:13,529
down right now. Turn your speakers down. How's that? Are we good? Put the music... All right.

20
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:22,230
Honestly, turn your shit down. The music might be insanely loud. It's gonna be so loud. Turn

21
00:05:22,230 --> 00:06:49,879
your speakers down. I'm serious. Am I missing something? Oh, over here. Did I break the game?

22
00:06:49,879 --> 00:07:03,699
Oh, new game. The game's called One Hand Clapping. Oh, I know it's due.

23
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:46,360
I can jump. My microphone's fine. It really is like an ambulance driving by.

24
00:07:53,079 --> 00:08:24,339
Am I sick? Am I over here? The audio is awful. That's the game. That is the game.

25
00:08:24,579 --> 00:09:24,919
I was on the key. What's going on? Hey, I thought that didn't sound like it. That was like, no way.

26
00:09:40,870 --> 00:10:06,759
How was it? Do a pedigree. Hey, Lois. Let's take a show. It's like auto.

27
00:10:06,759 --> 00:12:36,659
I'm so mad. See the beat? I can't break it. You have to understand. I am hearing this.

28
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:45,429
Do, do, knee, knee, two, two, go, go, two, two, the, the story story. It's fucking horrible.

29
00:12:54,179 --> 00:13:06,409
Oh, hi, guys. This is what I hear. I hear this. Isn't that tough to listen to?

30
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:44,169
This does not sound better. No, it does not. This there's no way this sounds better.

31
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:55,129
It does sound better. Give me a clip. One, two, three, one, two, three. Hey, what's up, everybody?

32
00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:28,570
I want to hear it. This does not sound better. No, it does not. This there's no way this sounds

33
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:37,159
better. It does sound better. Give me a clip. One, two, three, one, two, three.

34
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:48,019
That sounds like shit, guys. All right, fine. I'll keep it on. I'm turning this shit off during

35
00:15:48,019 --> 00:16:10,250
important things. Okay. So what do I do? I broke it. No, I didn't. Okay.

36
00:16:23,879 --> 00:17:10,940
There you go. Fuck off. What the fuck is going on?

37
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:53,859
I fucked that up. This sounds so bad. This is bad. Do the misery? No.

38
00:18:14,569 --> 00:19:12,839
Okay. Are you upset? No. What's going on?

39
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:53,130
Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fucking easy.

40
00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:18,759
Fucking easy. The louder you sing, the more the meter will fill.

41
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:21,700
That sucked. That sucked. That hurt so bad.

42
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:43,619
Okay, what do I do with this one? Just ride the clock? Do a cat puke?

43
00:22:45,450 --> 00:23:41,660
It was a button. I'm switching back and forth. It's going to be really loud. I could actually

44
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,900
just talk and it'll spin around and shit. That's fine. I have to hold the note.

45
00:23:48,839 --> 00:24:02,619
What time does it have to be?

46
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:42,230
Okay, we're good. This is, wow.

47
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,519
Singing is fucking hard.

48
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:09,240
I'm going to be speech jammed for the next like two, three hours. I have to sing duets?

49
00:27:24,019 --> 00:28:41,059
Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. I wish I could get new lyrics.

50
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:53,289
Fucking help me.

51
00:29:21,049 --> 00:30:22,150
Not even trying. I'm not going to sing an entire song to get this thing to fucking move up and down.

52
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,029
It's just.

53
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:53,450
What if I did like halfway like this? I can still hear it though. I think it's important.

54
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,700
Yeah, because I think that during the course of the game it records what I say

55
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:08,970
and plays it back. I'm 99% sure that there's two, there's cases in this game where you

56
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,099
you won't be able to hear it. It's important. It's got to stay.

57
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:14,599
Okay.

58
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:22,119
Use your webcam mic. Well now why I can't hear it now.

59
00:32:23,559 --> 00:33:01,339
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? What happened? Hello? It's important. I'm not going to use a webcam mic.

60
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:08,359
Oh my. Maybe I should. I'm very curious. What if I do that? We need to see what it's, I need to see.

61
00:34:11,269 --> 00:35:01,289
This thing doesn't, I can't do it. That was easy.

62
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:41,139
I can go. No, Shido is worse for him.

63
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:38,820
Let's go. Rip your vocal cords. I'll be all right.

64
00:36:44,969 --> 00:37:00,099
Did you warm up before this? Um, I think so. Kind of. Now what? Oh my god.

65
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:52,380
Yeah, I know it was bad. It was bad. I can't match that. That was bad. It works. It's okay.

66
00:38:35,900 --> 00:39:15,559
Why was I trying to go over? I was trying to go over that for no reason.

67
00:39:17,079 --> 00:40:41,210
That could have been better, but it's okay. I think I have to hit the button.

68
00:40:41,210 --> 00:42:15,079
That was really loud. That's why I have them both off. We're good. I gotta.

69
00:42:15,079 --> 00:44:01,860
Jerma, you look skinny. No, I'm like 170 pounds. I'm a fat fuck. What? That was close.

70
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:08,099
That was a close one. Scream into the mic.

71
00:44:54,409 --> 00:45:31,530
You're making me laugh. People are, I'm skinny. I'm five, seven, 170 pounds. That's, that's not,

72
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:39,559
that's not, that's overweight. That's actually fucking overweight. I'm not six, two. I'm literally

73
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:44,599
five, seven and a half. And yes, I may be a little overweight.

74
00:46:43,900 --> 00:47:15,699
God damn it. Imagine this with multiplayer. It'd be insane. Now what? Okay. This person

75
00:47:15,699 --> 00:49:02,460
hasn't done anything. Okay. What does that mean? It looks like I got out of prison. Why?

76
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,300
Dude, you're tone deaf. I'm not.

77
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:56,420
What do you mean Bjork? I don't sound like Bjork. What do you mean?

78
00:50:41,369 --> 00:51:01,429
The whole thing is fucked up now. I can't play anymore. Push your Adam's apple up.

79
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:32,780
And then somebody says Bjork and I'm like fuck. Oh, I hear like what? That's what I hear. You

80
00:52:32,780 --> 00:53:24,340
fucked up the whole screen. You fucked my whole screen. I hear that. I'm so thankful

81
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:39,989
to hear that. I'm so glad I have a container to puke into. I'm so glad I have a computer to

82
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:59,880
puke into. That's so fucking funny. It's not a computer. I can't hear anything.

83
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:15,719
I didn't mean to say computer. I meant to say a fucking coffee cup. I meant to say a coffee cup.

84
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:24,980
I'm being speech jams. You don't understand.

85
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:57,989
This is a coffee cup that I just spit everything into. No, I don't. That's coffee.

86
00:55:37,179 --> 00:56:18,840
It's not chewing tobacco. You fucking weirdo. I'm sorry. I don't even think of it. It's in my head.

87
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:25,800
You know, turn this shit off for a second. All I hear in my head is just Bjork and that person

88
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:43,769
ruined the whole stream. You fucking idiot. I don't even know what happened. I don't remember

89
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:50,500
what happened. I need a clip. I don't remember what just happened. I started choking. I puked

90
00:56:50,500 --> 00:57:17,780
into a coffee cup. What happened? I don't even know why that happened. Did he just puke? Can you

91
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:29,289
hear it? Hold on. Do you actually hear the puke sounds? No, you don't. Wait a second. You don't

92
00:57:29,289 --> 00:58:10,389
actually hear it, do you? No. It sounds like I'm inside of a fucking toilet bowl. No, I didn't

93
00:58:10,389 --> 00:58:31,510
puke. I just spit what was in my mouth. Okay. No, I didn't actually puke. That does look like I

94
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:37,110
actually threw up. You don't see me. I drank another sip. What the fuck? It actually is like

95
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:50,199
I puked. All right, let's go. We lost a thousand viewers during this, by the way. I think 2,000

96
00:58:50,199 --> 00:59:00,889
people left in the last 15 minutes. No, I didn't puke. I just spit what was in my mouth. Okay,

97
00:59:00,889 --> 00:59:15,880
this is clean. Viewers plummeting. Somebody just said, I'm close to leaving. All right. All right.

98
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:21,000
Fucking stop. Enough. Enough. Enough. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

99
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:40,920
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Are you ready? I just did like a curly laugh from The Three Stooges.

100
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:51,559
Fuck you. Fucking goddamn Bjork is in my head again. All right. You ready? Let's go.

101
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:08,099
What the fuck happened? I didn't make that noise.

102
01:04:11,590 --> 01:06:41,860
I said 100 gags. Stop naming musicians that aren't me. Stop naming people that aren't me.

103
01:06:43,530 --> 01:07:28,699
Stop. You're not a musician. Okay. Sure about that? Yeah. You sure about that? Fuck out of here.

104
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:53,820
Ban them. Imagine raging at a game like this. I was about to punch the microphone. I was going

105
01:07:53,820 --> 01:09:28,500
to punch the microphone. That was really fun. We're gonna play something else.

106
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,779
Let me try it without the headphones in.

107
01:10:14,329 --> 01:10:19,289
Bjork is is 100,000 times more talented than I will ever be in my whole life.

108
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:32,470
I can see that. I can understand that sentiment. So where we go now?

109
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:50,789
Vampire Survivors? Go back to Wheel of Fortune. Wheel of Fortune? I could turn on Wheel of Fortune.

110
01:10:50,789 --> 01:11:03,979
Yeah. Okay. We'll do Wheel of Fortune for like an hour or so. Okay. Yeah. Give me one sec.

111
01:11:03,979 --> 01:11:11,029
Change in game and change in console. That was really cute. These two games are actually really

112
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:26,840
cool. Something different. Something interesting. I've actually been sitting on those games for a

113
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:34,949
little while. The coolest part about that was one-handed clapping. Oh, one-hand clapping,

114
01:11:34,949 --> 01:11:42,779
by the way. That was the fact that you can see in real time. You probably could train

115
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:47,880
your voice pretty well. All right. I'll be right back. I'm going to get the Wheel of Fortune set

116
01:11:47,880 --> 01:12:09,460
up because it's on the Switch. So I'm going to get that set up or be right back. Just kidding.

117
01:12:10,729 --> 01:12:25,670
Now I'll be right back. I guess I don't really have to even go anywhere. Do I?

118
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:34,869
I'm trying to capture the Switch right now, which can be finicky. Give me one sec.

119
01:12:42,869 --> 01:13:02,859
Where is it? Where is it? It should be capturing it. I don't know why it's not.

120
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:10,920
My capture card can be really weird, though, for some reason. It just doesn't want to capture it.

121
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:17,130
Oh, hold on. Hold on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I know you can do it.

122
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:27,909
Come on. Come on. What do you mean no signal? Oh, I took the HDMI out of the back. All right.

123
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:28,869
Actually, BRB.
