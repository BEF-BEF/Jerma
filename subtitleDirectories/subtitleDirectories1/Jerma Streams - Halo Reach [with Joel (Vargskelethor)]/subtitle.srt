1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:10,890
Hey, what's up? Computers are difficult. Computers are hard to use. We're connecting

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,250
across the whole world to each other, all right? It's there. First of all, we had to get...

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,730
Listen, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Everyone, slow down.

4
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:25,460
We had to get our Xbox Live accounts to go through Steam to connect to the Microsoft servers to then

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,579
add somebody through Steam to then connect through Steam through the Microsoft Xbox servers to play

6
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:45,020
Halo Reach. It's 2019. We're still doing this shit. It's 2000. It's almost 2020.

7
00:00:45,899 --> 00:01:02,340
And we're still doing this. Traffic was fucking slow. But anyways, today, welcome everybody,

8
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:12,650
got something special for you today. Joel and I are going to be playing Halo Reach Co-op

9
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:21,400
Legendary Difficulty. That's right. That's what you're here for. That's why you showed up

10
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:38,329
on Legendary. That's right. Should be fun. We are currently... We tried to set this up and

11
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:45,769
there's a lot of random things that go into setting this up because it's all peer-to-peer.

12
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:56,709
So, you'll see. You'll see. This is a you'll see scenario. But we're going to do Squad Stream

13
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:05,829
and when Joel's... I think Joel's doing his intro now too. You'll see P2P of Mega Lul.

14
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:22,969
P pants to P pants. Yes, no, P2Pants is what it is. P2Pants. And they got like seven of these coming

15
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:36,250
out, don't they? This is like Halo. This is not even Halo 1. This is Halo 0. If you don't know

16
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:47,669
how this works. This is Halo 0. This technically is Halo 1, right? Halo 1 is Halo 2 or something.

17
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:55,800
It's a prequel. Yeah, right. Let me ping him. Let's see. What's the deal? Let's see. What's he

18
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,939
say? Oh, I think he is doing his intro. All right. So, yeah, we're going to play this.

19
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:10,469
I have to make a tweet too. Oh, ping him. Oh, I'm just going to ping him. That's the professional

20
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:16,759
term. Guys, we've never played a game on this channel with Joel before. I've got to use the

21
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:26,379
professional terms. I'm going to ping him. I'll get right on that. You know what I mean? Let's see if

22
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:50,819
we can lock this down, right? Currently typing. I'm going to say, come on in. Oh, here we go.

23
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:58,740
Let me tweet. I'll be right there. Stay tuned for Halo Reach and make sure you go to Burger King.

24
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:42,339
Just for no reason. Okay. I don't know. I'm sorry. I panicked. Have you guys heard about

25
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:58,860
Raid Shadow Legends? Let me call him. Here we go. Okay. Okay. I've got a new friend. Okay. So

26
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:14,420
hello. Hey. Hey, is it working? Yeah. Let's go ahead and lock this down. All right. I was

27
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:20,899
just talking about this, but we used to play a lot of Halo together, me and Jerma. I don't know if

28
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:26,899
you guys are familiar with X2 Clan. That was us back in 2009. You know, and we didn't know

29
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:33,379
each other. We didn't know each other. We thought we had played, or rather, you know, when I discovered

30
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:50,250
that Jerma was DPP on Feed Farm Exploit, I... PPP? No. Which one was it? PPP? No, no. Back

31
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:58,569
before they reinstated the server fix on the KD or stuff. Oh, no. That was bullshit. Do you

32
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:03,449
remember the ghost cycling they did? I got on the top of the leaderboards from that. And I'm sorry.

33
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:09,129
Are you utilizing an exploit? It doesn't count. Please. No, no. They left it in the game.

34
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:14,980
That was before QQ Recycling, I think. Yeah. That's before I cleared out my recycling bin.

35
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,860
So that was CC. There was a lot of shit in there, too. There was a ton of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.

36
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,259
There's like probably 60 gigs worth of stuff. And then I did that and I lost all my fucking exploits.

37
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:37,290
Do you know where I got Clan X2 from? What is Clan X2? I was just thinking of X-Men 2 and the

38
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:43,850
fucking poster. I was thinking, what is the most outrageous clan name I can think of? X-Men movie

39
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:53,350
poster. What the fuck? I was just like, what kind of aggressive gamer terminology can I throw at

40
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:00,709
the audience before they're like, ghost recycling? I don't know. I don't know any real gaming

41
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:08,389
terminologies. I'm just like, yeah, stats and exploits. Ghost recycling. I don't fucking know.

42
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:16,839
So, well, anyway, so, Jeremy and I, for real. Legendary. Yeah. We were going to do this on

43
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,279
Legendary because we're big boys. That's right. We did play a lot of Halo back in the day.

44
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,040
We actually really did. That's not even a joke. Everyone thinks it's the first time you guys have

45
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:33,560
like hung out. No, no, no, no, no. I threw a guy at work. I actually met Joel a long, long fucking

46
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,600
time ago and a lot of people don't actually know this, but I've known you since we were like, what,

47
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,680
15? No, we went to fucking high school together, man. We went, we took theater together.

48
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,319
Just go from another made up story to another made up story.

49
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:07,000
Sorry. I was going to come up with a story how you're like, you smashed your niece or

50
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,800
something like that. And I was going to fuck with you and just be like, this was before your name

51
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,519
was like, Biffy or something like that. Nobody knows what's real on these channels anymore.

52
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:24,279
Is your squad stream working? I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right, guys, by the way,

53
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,439
this is a squad stream. So you got two streams open potentially. Let's get an e-bike on.

54
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:37,909
So yeah. But for real though, we, we sat around here and, you know, not, not to imply that,

55
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,230
you know, we didn't just do something that was real, but, uh, no, no, here, here,

56
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,029
the brass tacks of it is that we set up, uh, the master chief collection here and it just came out

57
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:54,549
and, um, yeah, you know, not to poo poo on a game that is so beloved by both of us, but, uh, the

58
00:08:54,549 --> 00:09:00,070
problem about it is that the UI is like fucking horrible because they're using our Xbox live.

59
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,509
Yeah. And, uh, through, you know, through Microsoft. Yeah. Back to steam, back to you,

60
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,639
back to me, back to steam. And then we have to, what's the point of the Xbox account?

61
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,879
That's what I don't understand. If you, if you can invite somebody through steam,

62
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,840
what's the point of the Xbox just to like track your achievements or something?

63
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,480
Hmm. The steam achievements are the steam achievements for this game. If there is,

64
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:32,500
then I'm going to laugh at this steam achievements for this game. Well, back in the day,

65
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:43,909
back in the day, uh, me and, uh, what was your name again? What's my name? Oh, um, it's, uh,

66
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:53,990
tended D ragoon. So, so me and, and, and tended raccoon back in the day. This is before the

67
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,190
accident. Of course. Uh, we used to be known as the Chivo hunters. Uh, nothing to do with the

68
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,870
achievement hunter, but we used to collect Chivos on, on Xbox live and, uh, you know,

69
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:10,629
dude, there's 700 steam achievements. Wow. How do you even make that many achievements?

70
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:19,179
Is this game like $600 long? How are there 700 steam achievements? So we can invite you here. Uh,

71
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:27,590
Oh, we know you have to add, you have to do it on steam. There we go. Okay. Okay. There we go.

72
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:35,830
Yeah. All right. Are you guys ready for us to play legendary halo together? I can't wait. The

73
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,110
second we get in the car, I'm going to, it's going to be awesome, man. I'm going to high five.

74
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,590
Dude, the fucking memories are going to come flooding back. It's going to be, it's going to

75
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:54,360
be diarrhea out of my eye sockets. I'm going to think back on that. It's uh, it's great.

76
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,139
And I remember it fondly. There's something you guys don't know though. There's something you

77
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:06,980
don't know. We know something you don't know about our connection is bad. That's it.

78
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:13,610
Nah, no, cause, um, you know, somebody else is in the game.

79
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:25,850
How is this somebody in here? Who are these people? What fucking love are you in? Wait,

80
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:31,690
hang on. Wait, wait, wait. Can I play? No, no, no, no. Where am I? Where am I? You're in here.

81
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:41,500
I mean, how do I type? What are you talking about? In what fucking love did I end up?

82
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:49,320
I think this is a public lobby. I honestly don't even know who, who's who in here. Okay. I don't

83
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:58,259
know either. I think they can hear me talk, whoever they are. No, you're going to make it a private

84
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:04,100
invite only. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is, this is bullshit. I'm not part of any fucking

85
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:14,230
crew. All right. Get out, get out. No, no, no, no. Are you in a crew that has clone in it?

86
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,990
Why am I in this crew? We're both in it. No, no, that's not why. No, no, no. UNSC is like a

87
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:30,070
halo thing. Okay. Why are we in a, are we in a clan? Now you can see that required experience

88
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:37,700
with this game and, uh, no, you can press J to chat. Okay. If I say this, do you see that?

89
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:51,940
No. Wait, let me see. No, I just said scrote. Okay. So we have to make this a private lobby.

90
00:12:51,940 --> 00:13:00,039
All right. So go on your options. Make it like invite only. Okay. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

91
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:08,740
Fucking computers. We, uh, you know, we sat around for probably approximately an hour, uh,

92
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:15,000
off stream, just bashing our heads together. But, uh, this, uh, this is like oddly deja vu,

93
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,509
a thing that I experienced like five minutes ago. So, uh, imagine, imagine setting up like a stream

94
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:26,549
for like 45 minutes before the stream and it still has problems. This happens on every like

95
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:32,889
multiplayer game. All right. We'll do it. I was, I was joking with Jeremy. Like if this doesn't work

96
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:38,570
out, let's just like go on like a super Nintendo emulator and like hook up fucking like Bomberman

97
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:47,399
and play that instead. I'll just, I'll just come over your house. Okay. I'll take the, I'll take

98
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,850
the Elon Musk fucking under the earth tunnel. I'll be there in like 40 minutes. If people keep

99
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,450
joining my fucking lobby, I don't know how to like close up the lobby. It's like a bleeding wound.

100
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:03,450
Oh, people keep fucking joining. I don't know what to do. All right. All right. Ready? I'm going to

101
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:10,980
walk you through it. Ready? Go to your, your profile thing. Go to my game session. Privacy

102
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:19,269
invite only. Uh, Oh, here we go. A player count. Okay. Friends invite only. Okay. Bingo. Fucking

103
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:27,340
people keep joining. Kick player. How the fuck did people find me? I, okay. I said my name.

104
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:33,320
All right. So did I say your name too? Did we, did you, did I say your name? I said my name.

105
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:48,070
Oh, fuck. Oh, please. Your names are on your screens. All right. Let's try it again. Evite.

106
00:14:54,149 --> 00:15:00,779
No, no, you, you invite me. You invite me. Okay. I invite you. Okay. It's a fucking miracle. I can

107
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,389
dress myself in the morning. Hang on. Uh, all right. Now just get, you just, this is all,

108
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,070
we're just pumping ourselves up with the fucking legendary difficulty. That's right. That's right.

109
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:15,269
This is harder than the game. This is way harder than the game. This is legendary life. All right.

110
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:22,220
Hang on. Uh, but I can't invite you now. What the fuck? I I'm going to have a corner. I'm

111
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:34,980
going to fucking snap. But guys, guys, guys, this is all a meta joke. You see, we set this up to be

112
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,899
as hard as possible because we know that true gamers recognize skill. It's not, we're going to

113
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,139
show you that not only are we the master of overcoming challenges, but we're also the master

114
00:15:45,139 --> 00:16:02,360
of halos. Yo, where's my evite? Yo, where's my evite? I'm fucking trying. Hang on. Okay. Hang on.

115
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,379
The fuck? How the fuck do I invite you to the fucking game? I'm on steam right now,

116
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:13,269
but I've like lost the ability to invite you in. I love this. This is fucking great.

117
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,669
I was just saying this before the stream too, but like let dear God, let's not make this into a

118
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:30,600
tason day thing. Like overall, just our streams are open. Okay. Um, okay. Hang on. Let's see if I

119
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,480
can do this one more time. I'm going to go. Tell I have a great fucking idea, right? Hear me out.

120
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,240
You make the lobby because you, you have the fuck you, you, you are the brains here, right? I'm,

121
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,330
I'm the brawn. All right. You want to, wait, you want to put the training weights on? Absolutely.

122
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:54,299
Okay. It sucks. All right. Here we go. I'm ready. Got it. Yes. Okay. Good. Hang on. Hang on. I'm

123
00:16:54,299 --> 00:17:02,659
almost ready. Now we're talking, I think. Are we talking? I think we're talking. Oh yeah. Okay.

124
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:11,210
All right. I think we're talking. If I say this now, you see it. Thank you. Hold on. Hold on. Let

125
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:29,079
me just make sure this is good to go. Okay. Okay. Hold on. Legendary difficulty. All right. Just like

126
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:37,930
the old days. Warning. If you continue, you will lose. Yeah. Whatever. No bingo. There's more gamers

127
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:51,079
we don't lose. Welcome to halo reach. Now we're going to do a big let's play collaboration here.

128
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:58,460
You know, now you're all familiar with our content and this should be no surprise that we will be

129
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,819
doing this on legendary. We might do the extra DP levels afterwards, but right now we're going to

130
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:10,390
be focusing on solo right now. We're going to find all the, the secret tokens. We're going to find the

131
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:16,200
scrolls. How many are in each level? There's, there's four out of five. It depends on the,

132
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:24,819
on the QQP settings, but is this, is this a, is this a ghost recycling thing? It might be,

133
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:36,470
it might be, they might patch it. Oh shit. Master chief is dead. Is that supposed to be who that

134
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:42,809
is? Wait, huh? I look, I got a question. I know absolutely. I mean, all like jokes aside, I have,

135
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:48,809
I have no fucking idea what any of the stuff on the screen is. Is it like the, is it like

136
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,609
the star wars stormtroopers where there's like a bunch of master chiefs and then there's enough,

137
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:59,819
is that how it works? That's everybody dressed like that. Okay, dude, hang on. I got, I gotta

138
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:07,269
shut, take off the screen because people being a little foony about it. Hang on. Wait, how do I

139
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:14,779
disable like, okay, I'm going to take off the notifications. There we go. What are you getting?

140
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:24,730
Are you getting like friend invites? Yes. Welcome to hell. He's getting hundreds of

141
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:32,920
invites. Oh my God. I got, I got, I got 200 invites from a guy called organ farmer.

142
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:40,230
All right. So which one is you and which one is me? Do we know? I'm the guy with the two arms.

143
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:50,069
Okay. For a second, I was like, oh, right. Okay. I was like, who has two arms? Commander.

144
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,740
So that's our new number six. Is that, so that's master chief.

145
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,259
Wow. Only the parts that wouldn't cover the black chat. I gotta ask you a serious question here,

146
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:06,460
but how memorable is the mission? Cause we, we remember it really well, but I'm asking you guys,

147
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:17,339
not much, very pretty memorable. Okay. We just too damn important.

148
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:25,339
You know how people have their, their like from software list of dark souls one, then dark

149
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:29,259
shows two, then dark shows three. Like everybody has like their own little, where does halo reach

150
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:34,140
sit in the dark souls tier list? That's cat noble two meal and George four and five.

151
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:39,480
You're riding with noble. Is halo reached the bloodborne of from software games or where does

152
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,359
it sit into some shoes? The rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled me. I'm just happy.

153
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:50,119
What's the dark souls to the full strength of halo. I've seen your file. Even the parts,

154
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:56,839
the only sensors didn't want me to. I'm glad to have your skillset, but we're a team that lone

155
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:03,740
wolf stuff stays behind. What are they saying? I mean, I know it's worth it. Halo five is the dark

156
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,019
souls to from software games of Microsoft games. Cool. Dude, if I didn't have fucking brain damage

157
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,859
already trying to configure this shit, now I have that. This is the dark souls of bloodborne type

158
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:22,500
stranding games. What happened in that cut scene? We paying, we paying any attention at all?

159
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:39,750
Um, things happened and there was a cutting and like, okay, no, we're fine now. We're fine now.

160
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:45,269
Somebody just grabbed your internet hose and like kicked it for a second. Dude, let me tell

161
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:53,269
you something. My CPU is like made out of like silly putty and like, um, what do you have for

162
00:21:53,269 --> 00:22:01,269
a CPU? You got a chance. Maybe you can ask. I, I, uh, I have one. Um, I think it's an I five.

163
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:06,150
Beside the fucking point. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on back up. You're streaming

164
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,990
on an I five. You heard her dead zone confirmed. Well, what should I be streaming with? Uh,

165
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:20,759
that's red river. Listen, here's, here's the deal. Right? Is it, there's a piece of shit. I,

166
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,880
I drive a piece of shit car computer. It might not be that good, but it works. All right.

167
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,200
That's all that matters. It's hard. All right. Listen, I don't need the most technical stuff

168
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:36,359
to be a gamer. Listen, I don't, I don't have gunner glasses on. I sit around and I use what works.

169
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:42,839
All right. Beside the fucking point. That's me. My CPU, my CPU is so good that when games get

170
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:49,799
really intense, it shuts my internet off. I'm serious. That's so bad. Do you like, don't want

171
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:57,660
that to be happening. All right. And investigate the distress beacon. Okay. So if you know it up

172
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:03,019
and down, that's, that's you. Let's check it out. Okay. So what does 117 mean? Have we figured that

173
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:09,960
out? What is 117? Is that our ping? We thought it was the ping at first, but you're going to

174
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,960
discover soon that it might be more like looking like a telephone number after we reviewed how

175
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:25,259
it looks. So we have to investigate the beacon. How easy is this game? Anybody remember? Okay.

176
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:35,940
So how did you, how did you do emotes? It's very hard. Is this aim down sights?

177
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:44,019
No, it's a, it's just standard gamer. All right. I want you guys to experience standard gamer.

178
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:54,819
I want to experience how Mamma Mia, this, this fantastic latency between Mexico and Sweden,

179
00:23:54,819 --> 00:24:01,130
wherever you live, check this out. I'm going to jump. Ready? It looks great on my end,

180
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:10,869
but not on his end. This is my end. Do you understand how bad this is? That's really bad.

181
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:15,349
If you're on, if you look at his end, it's, it's very, very bad. So the training wheels are on.

182
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:18,869
So that, you know, when people jog and they walk and they have like the ankle bracelets and

183
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:24,869
wrist bracelets on that's what this is. You know, you know what though, Jerma, you know what though,

184
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:28,869
you know how much of a gamer I am. We're both playing, we wouldn't be playing on legendary

185
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,349
if we weren't gamers. Listen, listen, listen. Here's, here's why I'm classy. You're streaming

186
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:39,029
with a PC. I'm using something new. I'm using Google Stadia. I'm going to show you what late

187
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:44,710
this is all about. You know, I was literally, uh, I was trying to figure out what the fuck Stadia is

188
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:52,490
even for. I figured it out. Do you want to know the secret? What Stadia is for? Sloths? No, it's

189
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:59,130
for in, in 20 years when the internet is, that is good enough, like 8g is good enough. They will be

190
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,490
the ones that are here. It's a long play. It's completely worthless right now. And it'll be

191
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:11,690
worthless for probably five plus years. It is only here for 8g in like 2040. So, so you're saying

192
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,369
that that Google Stadia is basically, what's that thing where like people froze themselves down in

193
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:21,930
the 80s? It's a shitload of fall damage by the way. Uh, that's called cryogenics. So it's cryogenic

194
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:31,579
internet. That's the cry engine. It's called the cry engine. Okay. This, this is, this is I wish

195
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:34,779
we, we try this off a little bit off stream. I said like, this is fine. Now that I'm actually

196
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:42,140
doing it, it's like a fucking nightmare to play. That's why I would have, I would, I would have

197
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:49,940
been the person with the training wheels on. I wish we could switch hosts. Let's keep going

198
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,700
for a little bit. I mean, I, I can, I can accept this. You want to switch, we're going to switch

199
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:00,819
the levels after this. Like after we do this and I, I can handle it. I think it was a little

200
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:10,940
better on my end. When this came out again, I, I, I forget. 2006. No, no, it didn't.

201
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,049
Well, this, this is of course our 10th year anniversary. Don't you remember? Oh fuck.

202
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:28,279
These enemies. I don't think those enemies. I saw the rain.

203
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,990
Happy Thanksgiving. He killed some fucking Mars Turkey. All right. Where are you? Are you the one

204
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:45,430
with the 117? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is there a fire in this? Is there friendly fire?

205
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,690
Yes. Where's my health? I think I just murdered you. You did, but I'd respond.

206
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,490
But your corpse is still there. Wait, hang on your corpse. You're standing on your corpse.

207
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:02,339
Do it again. No, no. Kill, kill me. Kill me. And I'll like materialize on top of myself.

208
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:05,619
Yes. Like an existential crisis. We're going to do this until there's 50 corpses.

209
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:16,490
Okay. Yeah. Good. So we couldn't, we couldn't get it to death match because it took like

210
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,210
25 minutes to get into a lobby. So we'll just make a makeshift one right here on the stairs.

211
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:30,539
This is not actually going to work, right? There's no way this works. Are you dead? Okay.

212
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,500
Tell you what, tell you what, tell you what. I'm right behind you. Let's jump at the same time.

213
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,940
This is going to kill the server. We're going to have to start the mission over.

214
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,380
No, no, no, no, I won't. No, I just want to experiment. I want to see like, um,

215
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:50,220
the falling animation. All right. You ready to do this? Okay. Ready? Three, two, one, go.

216
00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:00,150
What? Oh, no, we have to block a door with our bodies.

217
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:08,460
All right. We have to make a door. We've blocked this whole door. Okay. Just kill me. Okay.

218
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:14,539
I don't, I think the actual bodies are like ragdoll, but boot player. You can boot you from

219
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:27,750
the game. Kill me here. Kill me. Come here. I'm going to boot you from your own hosted game. No,

220
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:37,099
this is my game. No, I forgive you. Okay. I don't wait. Don't shoot that guy.

221
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:41,589
How many bodies do you think we can actually put here? I don't know, but

222
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:49,160
keep piling up and shoot, shoot me too, man. All right. Don't poop me. Don't poop me. Make sure

223
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:56,569
you stand in the designated body area. Okay. Hang on. You know, what if you were, you were

224
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,089
betrayed by 10 to press X. You're going to boot this from, no, forgive, forgive.

225
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:10,140
Yeah. Don't accidentally boot me. It's always escape. Is anything despawning? No, I don't think

226
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:35,799
so. Something real bad is in this room. Legendary gamers here. True, true legendary gamers.

227
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,039
Let's do this until the server turns off.

228
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:46,119
You've heard of those like Counter-Strike AIs that keep on playing on offline servers

229
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,799
for like 20 years. Yeah. That's what we're going to be doing right now, except there's like nothing

230
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,910
but like piles and piles of feet sticking up. You guys can't hear the game. Okay. Let me, let me,

231
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:04,119
let me fix that. Hang on. I can't believe this is working. This, I don't think this has been one

232
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:16,230
despawn. Is there grenades? I, I think so. Can you guys hear this better now? All right. This is,

233
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,390
I know we're supposed to be playing Halo Reach on legendary difficulty, but what if we just,

234
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,589
this is what we're talking about. But what if we just make the ground that we're walking on

235
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:31,420
made out of bodies? And I'm talking like most of the ground that you see, like at least this whole

236
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:37,849
deck. We're going to show you how to like go to the secret, uh, places in the game. And it's just

237
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:44,900
like a pile of fucking like limps. Oh, how do you throw grenades? It's G. Okay. It's G.

238
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:52,619
But then, oh, fuck. No, all the cores are going to scatter if we grenade them. Wait. Oh, no, no.

239
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:59,660
It respawns the area if we both die. Oh, fuck. All right. We'll start the panning over here.

240
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,869
Okay. Hang on. Let me, let me redo the audio here because everything crapped out. Hang on.

241
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:11,589
It's not safe here. Okay. Right here. Yeah. This is because we're going to,

242
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:24,339
don't you want to make the whole deck? All right. Let's do it. Everyone's saying no. What? Uh,

243
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:34,809
you okay? I can't respawn. I'm. What's going on? Um, I keep spawning in the air over the edge

244
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:41,259
and dying over and over again. I can't do anything about this. We don't even need to.

245
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,539
Which one is me? Why is that one falling?

246
00:31:46,539 --> 00:32:01,289
I'm so lost. No. You have to jump in. You have to jump in. Otherwise, this area is unsafe.

247
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:08,710
No, no, no. You're good. Okay. Hang on. Okay. We don't even need to do. Okay. We're good.

248
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,900
All right. So, uh, halo is this way, I guess. Halo is this way, apparently.

249
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,700
Legendary gamers. I thought that was in the game. Streamers.

250
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:43,930
Bad guys. Kill them. I didn't do it. That was a full clip.

251
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:50,410
Hey, you quit that.

252
00:32:53,750 --> 00:33:20,700
So he's dead. Wait, what is this person dead? Yeah. Hold on. I can't, let me turn up the audio too.

253
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,740
Like I can't barely hear what they're saying.

254
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:31,990
The audio is like weird in this game. Yeah. I've heard like there's complaints about the

255
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:38,380
audience being like total ass balls in this, but you try, you unloaded a whole clip on that guy

256
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,299
and he didn't kill him. And you tell me that like a little bit of a splash from a grenade

257
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:47,180
was the end of his health pool. Where are you? Okay. I'm right behind you. Hang on.

258
00:33:47,180 --> 00:34:00,339
Oh, the campaign audio is fucked up. The audio has a huge encoding issue. Oh, it's messy.

259
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:08,340
Yeah. I, this is the first time I've ever held this weapon in fake life.

260
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:21,460
Press Q. It's a punch. All right. I'm almost dead. Wait. First enemy. Our first enemy. Oh,

261
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:34,840
I was about to go. Yeah. I think this difficulty here is not going to stem from the actual game

262
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:43,400
being difficult. It's us having like collective brain diarrhea, AKA too much fun. There is too

263
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:49,559
much fun. You can never have too much fun. All right. Check time. Where are the enemies?

264
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,960
Tell what? I have a question. Can you see other bullet decals? If I do this?

265
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:03,750
Yeah, I can see that. Okay. You want to drop some shit on the walls? Sure. Okay. Unfortunately,

266
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:12,409
fuck. They despawn. Okay. Quick, quick one. All right. I got that. This is wind,

267
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:15,289
lose or draw. I'm going to just think. What is it? What is it? What is it? Let's see.

268
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:25,719
I don't know. Circle. This is like a draw full. All right. Ready? Here you go. No. Okay. Okay.

269
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,880
Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to mute. I'm going to tell my stream what it is.

270
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:49,989
It's going to be super Mario. Okay. So what is that? Man with two arms. It was super Mario.

271
00:35:49,989 --> 00:36:00,199
Close. I see movement. Do you pick the guns up? I don't know. How do you pick them up?

272
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:10,059
All right. Shoot. Now we're talking. If I start dying, I'm going to start playing.

273
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:18,980
They're behind us. Oh, okay. Is somebody in the room? That's a fucking team. They're coming in

274
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:29,139
the house. Are they? What this? Okay. The, the mini map is crazy. Okay. This is not helping the

275
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:37,219
fact that I had like 9,800,000 ping. I guess a nightmare to play this. It is a nightmare.

276
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:46,869
I'm dead. Oh, fuck. I'm dead too. Area's not safe. Yeah. You have like a, you have probably

277
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:54,019
1000 milliseconds. Okay. Here's what we do. I have a proposal, right? Cause it's going to be

278
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:59,989
impossible for me to shoot, right? Here's what we do. I'm going to chase or rather you just chase

279
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:05,590
me. I just run the fuck for it. All right. Run forward. Yeah. Okay. No, basically, basically I'll,

280
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:12,550
I'll skirmish ahead and you protect me. All right. I think we can do this. You go ahead. Go for it.

281
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,309
All right. Let's go. I don't know where you are, but go for it. Just fucking come on.

282
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:27,300
Did you watch out? It's you doing that. Hey, get the, get the follow me, man. You gotta follow me.

283
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:39,539
Okay. I'm following you. Come on. Come on. Okay. We're good. Okay. Get in the barnyard.

284
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:51,400
Is there a barnyard? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Nice. Watch it. Watch it. Yeah. We've got a plasma

285
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,239
rifle down here if you want it. Is it really? Yeah. Right here. Nice. Let me see that.

286
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,820
You be careful with that thing. Hold E to swap. Yep. I like this thing a lot.

287
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:14,119
Now I, I get it now. I get it. I've been playing for less than five minutes. I get it.

288
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:26,219
I'll do what's behind you, dude. What? Where are you? Right here. Dude. Do you get it? Do you like

289
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:30,380
get it now? Like after playing like that, just the way the weapons feel and the environment. I feel

290
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:37,340
it. It's coming back to me, man. It's like I never left. They never left boys. All right. Let's get

291
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,820
some vehicles or something. Cause as soon as we get in the car or something, that's when the gamer

292
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:51,849
skills unlock. Yeah, absolutely. I agree. Anymore down there? The fuck's falling from the sky?

293
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:57,860
I don't know. It's just like space trash. Someone's just dropping trash on me.

294
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,860
All right. This is legendary and we're doing just fine. We are doing, but we never, we haven't

295
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:15,849
even done died once. No, not yet. I get the space bookers across the bridge and they drop the

296
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:27,880
dropping range on this thing. I'm missing out on ammo. Oh fuck. Careful of grenades. Is there any

297
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,650
guns? You see any guns? You have fucking infinite ammo yet. They're complaining about like guns.

298
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:43,849
What you do is infinite. I think you're out of ammo. I, yeah, I didn't have any left. Oh,

299
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:49,610
oh, okay. Well, you switch up for the fucking like cock and ball gun. Everything sucks.

300
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,159
Dude, you never use the pistol in any video game. It's like the worst weapon in every video.

301
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:04,860
The pistol pistol is great. Is it the only game that's good? Yeah. Holy shit. It really is like

302
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,429
kind of good. You're right. Well, I don't know about this game, but I know the previous one is

303
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:13,670
pretty. All right. Shit. There might be some vehicles around. I think I see the remains of

304
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,150
like a space scooter or something. Hang on, dude. And the amount of time it takes to develop the

305
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,389
pistol in most video games that are modern video games, you could have like just maybe like fix

306
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:28,869
some of the net code. Most of the video games you play, the pistol don't do shit.

307
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:36,550
The shotguns in the Halo games are great because they literally fire half a meter.

308
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:43,510
They are disgustingly bad, but they're good like because you don't get a lot of range

309
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:49,190
in Halo, but they are completely useless. People are talking about how I just have no idea what

310
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:57,699
the fuck I'm talking about. So it's a typical Wednesday. Okay. I don't know where the fuck I am.

311
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:00,900
Oh, there you are. Okay. Hey, I was just following you. I'm just on slash. Okay.

312
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:14,599
Are there bosses in Halo? There might be. Oh, get him. Get him. Get him. I heard you get those guys.

313
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:15,719
Get him.

314
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:27,079
Get those good orders from the commander. Get him. Shoot nature. Shoot the barnyard.

315
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:33,460
Who, sir? I don't know. Him. I'm dead. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good.

316
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:40,469
You can just spawn on me. Okay. Where the fuck are you? I'm using this fucking underdeveloped

317
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:47,349
pistol. They could have fixed the net code. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm gonna die.

318
00:41:48,309 --> 00:42:01,139
What? Why the fuck am I charging? I'm not fucking going out there.

319
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,659
This is just, all right. You played WoW Battlegrounds when it was like 40 versus 40.

320
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,699
Did you play Warcraft back in the day? I'm a big World of Warcraft player, actually. I have a big,

321
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,420
big history with that game. Sometimes you'll aim and just hit a random person and then everyone

322
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:28,019
else is doing a bunch of work for you. This is just Altered Valley. Yeah. I think I did something.

323
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:36,090
I put a dot on a guy. Okay. Well, listen, I'm going to get the space turkeys.

324
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:42,730
Oh my God. I just took so many hits. I have no ammo. You know what? This game needs big sniper

325
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,849
rifles. You can take pot shots from two countries away because you don't want to be in this oatmeal

326
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:55,659
of fire and lasers. No, you don't. I need a weapon. Ow. I'm dead. Can I just give you my weapon?

327
00:42:55,659 --> 00:43:01,849
This is ridiculous. No, I'm still here. I'm still here. Okay. There we go. This is what I'm talking

328
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:12,619
about. Playing this feels like I'm drunk. It feels like I woke up in this game and they sprayed my

329
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:19,139
pillow with PCP and said, here, have a gun shoot. This feels disgusting to play. I can't tell you

330
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:23,699
why this is so off. Like you might be like, well, you're playing like shit, Joel, but

331
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:32,019
I feel like these guys are so hard. Why are these guys so hard? Okay. Are these enemies

332
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:39,429
throwing grenades in here? Okay. Listen, here's my strategy. Okay. No. Okay. Check this out. Check

333
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:43,909
this out. That's right. They're standing over there. Let's not deal with that. Let's just do

334
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:53,050
this instead. Fuck it. Whatever the fuck's going on over there, we just. I hesitated for a second.

335
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,469
Okay. Don't wait. Don't we have to go over here though for the objective?

336
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:07,460
I found a fucking vehicle. Hang on. Hang on. I think so. Oh, please get us in that car. Oh,

337
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:12,550
no, it's not a car. It's a, it's a remains of something. Oh, hang on. I found you a gun. I

338
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:24,389
found you a gun. I found you one of these, whatever it is. This isn't good. All right,

339
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:32,900
let's go. Let's go help our friends. This is like an auto stapler. This is a staple.

340
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:39,059
This is a stapler. Is stapler any good? Um, I don't remember, but maybe.

341
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,619
Are you waiting? You winning? I don't know. I don't think so.

342
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:56,570
It seems like you're doing it. I'm hiding behind a tree. Okay. Listen,

343
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:05,420
my God, these guys are all like, these guys are all bosses. Dude, I don't know if you see the same

344
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:12,139
shit on my screen, but like I said over here, it's the corpus on, on local or is it multiplayer?

345
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:22,739
I see this one dude and it's like, do you see this? Yeah. This guy just makes sure he's dead.

346
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:29,449
How do you, what's the heel button? You think there's a heel button? Hi,

347
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:35,139
old halo heart. Right. Right. That's what I'm going to say. Okay. Boomer. Okay. Boomer.

348
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:47,110
All right. This guy's going to kill me. T he doesn't do anything.

349
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:57,420
Okay. They took all my shields off this game. Like again, I don't want to criticize this game,

350
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,539
but uh, it feels like we've taken on a task. It feels like everybody's like,

351
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,099
it's an equivalent of like being in a room full of like, uh, neurosurgeons

352
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:09,980
and you don't know what the fuck's going on. And you just stand in there with,

353
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:15,980
with a suit on saying, yes, I agree. Like there's so much shit happening and I can't contribute.

354
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,139
Do headshots matter? Yeah. They weren't a room full of surgeons. It's true.

355
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,019
And they just all handed us scalpels and they're like, all right, uh, this guy needs a new brain.

356
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:32,969
Go for it. Like, Oh God, what does this scalpel do? The headshots do anything.

357
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,260
Don't give me that. Oh, we did it. We did it. We did it.

358
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,699
Look at this space turkey. You guys didn't think we were going to do it.

359
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:47,670
You're with six and I will run interference on the ground. We'll meet you at the output.

360
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,750
Look at this disgusting, disgusting fucking creature. Look at these things.

361
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:58,460
It's a waste of imagination. Look at him. Is that a mouth? What's his mouth?

362
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,300
You think there's a God, you think there's a God after looking at that thing? Look at him.

363
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:09,139
You're looking at his ass.

364
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:18,739
Yes. We're looking at the wrong way. How do you? Oh, of course. How do you right now?

365
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:25,269
Can you heal? Listen, just get in the car. Wait, we're going to get in our own cars.

366
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:33,210
No, no, no. Okay. Fine. Fine. You, you want to fucking drive it? Wait, hang on. Wait,

367
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:38,329
they all get in this car? No, no, no, no. I'm coming in. Okay. Now I'm riding in a shotgun.

368
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:46,659
Yeah. What the fuck are you doing? I'm flipping. No.

369
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,840
I was going to put a grenade underneath the car because I forgot to get like manually

370
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,880
flip them and I accidentally like murder. Fuck you. I'm sorry. Okay. Well, I hit a rock. Whatever.

371
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:08,039
We have to wait for our friends to get in. It's bumbling. Fuck. Let's go. All right. So now we

372
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:17,059
have to go. Don't crash. Careful. By the way, don't leave plasma burns. Why am I getting like a

373
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:21,619
breaking news bullet? What was that? The equals control like shit inhaler. So yes, they do. Watch

374
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:29,380
out. Yes. I can't even turn the car left. No, you used the mouse, dude. You drive with the mouse.

375
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:39,269
What the fuck? Yes. You're running on a turkey. Fuck him. Fuck him. Hang on. An alligator by you.

376
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:45,260
Well, there are enemies here. There are actual enemies here and we care about the turkeys.

377
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:53,030
All right. I'm going to get in a good spot. Okay. Where are they? Go get them. Are they up there?

378
00:48:53,829 --> 00:49:06,840
All right. Get them. Nice. Excellent work. That's right. There we go. Ooh, that was pretty good.

379
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:15,179
It's as if you don't. It's just like you don't have 10,000 ping. Hey, I try my best. I probably

380
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:21,079
shouldn't have gone this way. We have a blue guy after us. I don't know if we're supposed to

381
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,480
pick him up or. There's a blue guy. Yeah. They're like sort of a little bit more.

382
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:32,780
That guy, that guy right there. Is he going in the car or not like this?

383
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:41,139
Not like this. I don't think I think he just stands around. All right. Let me get on the road.

384
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:53,900
Can you do my favor? Can you just like smash into a Mac five? Oh, hang on. This is actually

385
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:59,420
is kind of hard to control because in my brain it's A and it's A and D. What's that?

386
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:04,489
Yeah, it's 5G. It's a 5G tower. Fucking take it down.

387
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:13,559
Google Stadia. Do you know anyone who uses that by the way? Google Stadia or whatever.

388
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:19,400
Am I saying that right? Stadia Stadia. How the fuck do you say it? I think it's I have no idea.

389
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,360
I think it's Stadia. Stadia. Okay. It's Stadia. You know anyone who uses that?

390
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:41,449
No, there's no reason to. All right. Let's go. Okay. You know, you know, I didn't know this

391
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:45,449
about the Stadia. Do you know that it's so you pay money a month to use the Stadia

392
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:54,179
and then you have to buy the games too. Now it fucking works.

393
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:13,860
I'm surprised you even got it in. I improvised. Okay. No, no, no, no. Ready? All right. You buy

394
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:18,579
the game so that if they ever want to not let you play it, they can just cut off access.

395
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,119
Okay. I was going to say that you drove like shit, but actually playing this

396
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:33,110
with a mouse delay is a fucking nightmare. Like you guys have no idea how bad this is.

397
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:43,829
You can't. Your thing's going to explode. We need that thing. But later it's over. It's stuck.

398
00:51:44,789 --> 00:51:50,389
You fucked it. No, no. Just grenade me off. Lightly bump me. Boop me. Boop me. No, no, no.

399
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:55,429
Fucking shoot me. No, I don't have any grenades. Well, fucking, fucking. All right. Hang on here.

400
00:51:56,869 --> 00:52:04,579
I can punch it. Oh, it's working. It's working. It's working. There you go. There you go.

401
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,380
The car's on fire. Okay. But it's not detailed logic. Is it? It's still good to go.

402
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,019
No, no. It's not detailed. It's not going to explode. Okay. I hope so. It'll be fine.

403
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:22,699
It'll be fine. Get in the car. But don't we have to kill these mutants? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you're

404
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:31,530
shaving with me. Ironically. Ironically. Oh, wait, wait. Are we on a timer? I don't know. Oh,

405
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:37,429
hang on. Hang on. Okay. There we go. Okay. Do you want to drive this for a minute? Maybe I should

406
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:45,670
drive. Oh yeah. Okay. Cause you have the, you have like the 5 million input delay. I have the coma

407
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:58,219
delay. Oh, we got to destroy that. We have to destroy the giant rumble vacuum. Get it. There you

408
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:04,809
go. Nice shooting. Oh, they're gonna drop out of here. You fucking run them over, man. You got the

409
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:15,059
car. We're still, we're still good to go. We're still, we're still good to go. Still. All right.

410
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:22,420
Okay. I'll teach how to do this. Get in the fucking car. All right. Listen. How is the car still

411
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:35,099
active? It's still going. All right. Does this one work? No. Now you're going to have to deal

412
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:42,920
with this one. All right. I'm getting in. Okay. Hold position. Defend the evac zone. We're going

413
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:49,320
to defend this evac zone. All right. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's get you out of here.

414
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:59,079
Wait. Okay. Here it comes. No, we're still good. We're still good. See what I mean?

415
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:14,579
Uh-oh. Hey, I got the car back. What the hell? All right. He's in with you. Corporal Travis.

416
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:21,750
Okay. Go for it. It's the covenant. Let's get you out of here. Back into this guy.

417
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:30,650
All right. I'm going to clean this up. I'm going for it. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh,

418
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:40,059
I got to take it off a G. I want grenade on like mouse four. Well, the area sounds safer.

419
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:45,960
Okay. So you got to clear stuff up. Yeah. You live pretty good. You let me know when you want

420
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,519
to take off the like the weights on your arms for like the, all right. And we'll switch off.

421
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,360
You're going to fucking, you're going to see how bad this is. Oh, it's bad.

422
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:05,369
Gee, we tried. I have a great idea. Ready? Okay. Take this up. I'm just going to hide it.

423
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:14,969
I was going to say the same thing. I have a better idea. Get in the car and I have a great

424
00:55:14,969 --> 00:55:20,090
idea how to solve this issue. Right. Okay. You just fucking murdered that guy. Like you just

425
00:55:22,409 --> 00:55:26,650
now they're just aiming over. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just get in the car. I promise.

426
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:37,690
What are you, are we going to independence day by the spoiler for independence day?

427
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:46,090
You know, so if that movie came out like 1998, do I really care that we're going to go boys on

428
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:53,539
back, just fly in the, where are we going elsewhere? We're fucked this place. They can do it.

429
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:01,769
New car. Oh shit. Hang on a little problem here. Okay. But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

430
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:08,039
we got this. I think we have to pick up the ordinance. I don't have to wait. All right.

431
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:14,840
There we go. All right. You drive. I ride shotgun this time. Okay. And if we can't have it,

432
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:26,519
nobody can. I'm out of ammo. I don't think you can destroy it. You want to ram it and see if you

433
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:31,320
can. We've got, we've got a brand new set of wheels. All right. Grab the ordinance. Okay.

434
00:56:35,269 --> 00:56:38,920
I don't know why, but this feels like,

435
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,940
this doesn't feel like a space shooter feels on some like redneck molasses game.

436
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:53,099
All right. We got, we got to hide back here. Okay. Well I'm fucking dead.

437
00:56:54,139 --> 00:56:58,860
Okay. Well I'm going to not die. Here we go. We just defend this point. Grab the ordinance.

438
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:08,070
Where's the, what is an ordinance somewhere? What's an ordinance? What is an ordinance? Hey

439
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:20,179
gamers, welcome back to another let's play of the toe jam in Ireland. Now I don't want to give this

440
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:23,219
game shit once again, but like this feels so disorienting and I don't know if it's because

441
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:28,980
of the lag. Oh, it's definitely because of your input lag. You might as well have one eye closed

442
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:35,880
and like three spoonfuls of peanut butter in your mouth. That's, that's what it feels like.

443
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:43,300
Oh, and both of your socks are soaking fucking wet and your shoes. You're in shoes and socks.

444
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:53,750
And it's like, you stood in a puddle and you just kept them on, you know, I'm going to get a little

445
00:57:53,750 --> 00:58:00,150
real with you. I don't think playing on legendary was a great idea for this, but we have to, that

446
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,110
if you don't play, look, you know how many people are streaming this game right now and they're

447
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:08,809
playing on legendary. We have to keep up with the streamers. All right. They're going to leave us

448
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:18,010
in the dust. If we don't, we're going to do one. I got a little pit for you. You get the fuck out

449
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:22,099
of here. You just leave it. We're going to get battlefield. It's going to say you're moving too

450
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:30,360
far away. And it was no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I see checkpoint done. What? It said checkpoint

451
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:40,179
done. So I'm doing something right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Are we not softlocked?

452
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:48,570
Can we get unsoftlocked? We've already been here. Okay. Can't the AI like just play with

453
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:53,530
themselves for a little bit and you know, people are saying like turn on V sync and it'll be done

454
00:58:53,530 --> 00:59:02,699
or like it'll be better, but see reset the checkpoint. We're seeing set pieces. We're

455
00:59:02,699 --> 00:59:08,840
not supposed to see yet. The cameras aren't here yet. I'm going to ask you something.

456
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:17,260
Go for V sync. What the fuck is V sync called vertical sync. It sinks every frame.

457
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:22,940
Okay. Because, because after years of streaming, V sync for me has just become synonymous with

458
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,699
turn this shit off because it doesn't work. Yeah. It locks your frame rate down to your monitor's

459
00:59:26,699 --> 00:59:32,219
refresh rate, which can help in some scenarios. It gets her to screen tearing, but it will not

460
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:37,179
let you go to the maximum for your graphics card is capable. So let's say if you have V sync turned

461
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:42,619
on and you have a 60 Hertz, a 60 refresh rate monitor and it'll look a little chunky and

462
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:47,019
we're dead. In fact, I think I came into two pieces. All right. So we're going to put it to

463
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:55,769
heroic difficulty. How do we turn it on? I think you have to do it. Do I have to do it?

464
00:59:55,769 --> 01:00:08,380
You're the host. Yeah. Hold on. Where is settings? Okay. Difficulty. Gameplay. I think we have to go

465
01:00:09,099 --> 01:00:12,059
with the exit of the game. All right. We're going to try it for real one more time.

466
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:20,340
One more try. All right. I'm down to plan on it. Try, but you promise me you will do your absolute

467
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:26,260
best this time. All right. I concentrate all your, our gamer juices into one, one, one shot here.

468
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:36,199
All right. Yeah. I can't, I can't change it. All right. Let's try it. I really like, like

469
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,780
just a little quick side note. I really wish we could just do like team slayer or something like

470
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:51,460
that or capture the flag because this feels so good Lord. We have to get to the first boss.

471
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:56,579
Oh, hey, look at this checkpoint. Oh, nice. All right. This is perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.

472
01:00:56,579 --> 01:01:04,840
Now we can. Okay. Now they don't even know we're here. My teammates are screaming, but I don't give

473
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:18,179
a fuck. This is perfect. Actually. Holy shit. This worked. Hey, you just be careful here. Remember,

474
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:23,940
you got to press, you got to press you to, um, get the health up real quick. Is that, is that really

475
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:36,619
doing anything? You. Yeah. What? I thought it was people saying T. No, I lied to you. Legendary is

476
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:50,170
hard, especially if you are too. All right. All right. Whatever. Whatever you say. Oh, I think this

477
01:01:50,170 --> 01:02:00,260
thing has a scope on it. How you doing? Doing good. Now I'm going to take it off. Yeah. It's coming

478
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:05,699
back to me, man. Also make sure this is a pro tip that I heard from the chat because I apparently

479
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:16,199
was doing poorly. If you don't hold the button down, it's more accurate. Jerma, don't take this

480
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:37,619
the wrong way, but do you play video games? Yes, I do. Did you do that? Have you, have you,

481
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:43,300
have you ever been in a video game before? Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute here.

482
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:55,099
Hold on. Have you, have you, have you, have you, um, have you, um, have you beaten Sekiro? Listen,

483
01:02:55,099 --> 01:03:01,460
I don't know if you know this, but I happen to know someone. His name is Jeff Keeley. He's hosting

484
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:06,099
the video game Olympics. Do you know, you actually know him? When I, when I go on the video game

485
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:12,099
Olympic stage and someone gets a little, I just notice and I wink at the camera. I don't know what's

486
01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:21,130
going on. I'm here to stay. And gamers don't lose. So that was a very long-winded way to say no.

487
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:30,699
I've never beaten Sekiro. I think I've got a couple more gamer, uh, Boy Scout badges.

488
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:42,179
Where are you? Is that the challenge for me to play Sekiro and beat it? Yeah. I'll tell you what,

489
01:03:42,179 --> 01:03:45,780
here's what we're going to do. We're going to settle this. We're going to settle this with some,

490
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,780
uh, actually there might be shit behind us. That's okay. I was going to, I was going to do

491
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:53,780
a cowboy duel. Whatever strongest weapon I have, we shoot each other in the head and whoever loses

492
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,780
loose the argument. So, uh, okay. Wait, you mean, no, no, you mean like here in the game?

493
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,989
Yeah. He's fucking murder you.

494
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:16,760
That's the easiest fucking easy. Oh yeah. That sounds like a good idea.

495
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:22,119
I would go first though. Oh, okay. Fine. That's fair.

496
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:37,059
Why are we like green? I don't know. What happened to that bridge? Oh, no, no. Okay. You activate

497
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:45,800
night vision with four. If you press four night vision, it's like goo mode. Yeah. This is not

498
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:51,769
night vision. This is just highlight everybody with neon markers. People are saying in chat,

499
01:04:51,769 --> 01:05:03,559
welcome to fallout three. Did you play a fallout three? Um, I did. Not very long though. I did. I

500
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:12,869
played new Vegas, you know, something called baths. Yeah. What about the one where you freeze and it

501
01:05:12,869 --> 01:05:19,849
goes, no, no, no, no, no. And I should, I can't even fucking end the call right now. Cause after

502
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:27,349
hearing that, I'm going to have one area. All right. We have to play. We have to play. Get

503
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:39,190
ready to play. All right. And then we turn the difficulty down and then we switch so you don't

504
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:48,789
have to deal with the insane horrible problem. Oh dude, watch out. It's him. What? It's him.

505
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:58,340
Who's who? That guy behind you, dude. No, no, behind you, dude. No, no, no. What happened?

506
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:08,219
Who? Him? Who's him? Who? Who are you referring to? Who? The collective who like them, you know,

507
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:17,579
like multiples. What the fuck? No, why I, I warned you about it. What happened? What happened?

508
01:06:18,699 --> 01:06:28,309
I, I did, let's just say I did a very good job. Okay. You know, Jeremiah, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta

509
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:34,309
drop the, the, the, the facetious bullshit here for a second, but I think this might be the worst

510
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:38,550
fucking game play of Halo Reach out on Twitch right now in the world. No, no, no, no way.

511
01:06:39,989 --> 01:06:44,230
I know I can't, no way, no way. We're in legendary difficulty. These people that are playing this

512
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:50,329
uneasy right now. Come on. Remember we're playing like limbless toddlers.

513
01:06:55,559 --> 01:07:03,769
And we're doing a great job. I think we're doing just fine.

514
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:13,139
They're going to get you again, man. That was the shit on me.

515
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:21,639
Oh, this is a sniper rifle. No, no, no. I'm fucking serious. You were betrayed by tender dragoon.

516
01:07:21,639 --> 01:07:30,440
I'll take that sniper rifle. Where is it? Okay. Hang on. Wait, put on a night vision.

517
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:39,719
Is that it? You didn't take it already. No, where is it? Hold still. Hold still. Are you,

518
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,840
are you holding it? No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I was holding it. That would be embarrassing.

519
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:49,900
Am I blind? No, I can't pick it up. Is that it on the ground right here?

520
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:55,340
No, no, no, no, no. There was one that was like a burst. Right. Am I holding it? No, no, no, no.

521
01:07:55,340 --> 01:08:01,510
God damn it. No. Guys, you saw the fucking battle, right? It's on the wall. You mean on the wall.

522
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:06,679
Oh, no. Okay. There it is. There it is. Oh, fuck. I thought it was like on the ground. All right.

523
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:17,720
Me too. Listen, I think it's really awful of you guys to talk down to extremists that has

524
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:26,100
porcelain eyes like us. And I want to make, I want to make a public awareness PSA about,

525
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:33,369
you know, they are gamers with two porcelain eyes and we exist and you should

526
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:38,569
stop being so condescending all the time. Can you hear how much, how many, how many

527
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:51,859
key presses I'm pressing? That means I'm doing great. Porcelain eyes? Are you sniping?

528
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:58,699
No, no, no, no. Well, there's a guy over there. Hang on. I think you get the sniper rifle. Yeah.

529
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:02,460
Yeah. Are we supposed to be doing something in particular here? Yeah. We need to fall back into

530
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:13,420
autopilot. All right. We need to keep Kat and Ernie alive. Well, Emily. Ernie? Headshot this guy. Nice.

531
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:19,539
Okay. Somebody says we need to get the forklift. You can drive the forklift.

532
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:26,229
Wait, you can drive the forklift. Apparently. Chat's saying that. That's pretty sick. Really?

533
01:09:26,949 --> 01:09:33,289
I don't know. I'm going to, I like the sniper rifle. I'm a, I'm a real precise precision gamer.

534
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:45,460
All right. The closet. Good. You can't. Okay. Good. All right. A day to stand right in the middle

535
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:48,819
and get crushed by the, like the elevator doors. You want to do it at the same time?

536
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:54,260
Is that going to happen? You want to fucking get strawberry or jammed it.

537
01:09:55,060 --> 01:10:00,979
All right. Let's, let's go. Let's go. Oh, I know the thing with the elevator just opens back up.

538
01:10:01,779 --> 01:10:07,449
Like, you know, when you go to the elevator, somebody's like, oh shit, hold it for you.

539
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:14,470
Cause then they make the sensor open. All right. Well, give me a rifle.

540
01:10:15,029 --> 01:10:25,180
Are you talking to me? All right. We're good. All right. We did it. That only took 25 hours to do.

541
01:10:26,619 --> 01:10:36,649
That was pretty good. You're in here, right? Yeah. All right. Uh, we have to use our night vision.

542
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:42,100
All right. Here we go. Press four. You ever heard of gunner glasses?

543
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:51,100
Yeah. I got gunner optics. I have, did you do that? Where's the rest of you? No, no.

544
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:59,779
We got split. Are you wearing them right now? Battle the cops. All right. Stay put.

545
01:10:59,779 --> 01:11:05,460
We'll get you a combat. Are you seriously plasma damage? When you're talking to me,

546
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:11,060
you found something. I'll take that. Not your domain. I got a live one over here.

547
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:12,100
I don't have an off switch.

548
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:29,779
It's all right. I got her. Keep still and I'll release you. So which one of these is halo?

549
01:11:29,779 --> 01:11:52,390
I think I died. All right. Here we go. Start that rock.

550
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:05,819
Negative four. Stay on the entrance to handle her five and six. Clear the hole. We're five and six,

551
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:21,939
right? Yeah. There's the forklift. All right. Guys, I have a really dumb question, but, uh,

552
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:25,380
Oh, I can't drive it. Oh my God. Can you get in? I don't think I could get in.

553
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:30,579
I think it's only you. You have just in the street sweeper. Okay. Can you lift me?

554
01:12:31,539 --> 01:12:44,199
Can you move? Can you get out of here? Yep. I guess. Nope. Can you actually activate the

555
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:56,550
throngs? What the fuck happened? I'm upside down. All right. There you are. Good. All right. Okay.

556
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:04,229
All right. Go, go fork somebody. I'll try. Hang on. They're behind us. The complete opposite

557
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:13,699
direction. Oh, I'm stuck on some boxes. Hey, welcome back to Shenmue everybody.

558
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:26,949
Can this music start? I feel like this music is about to start, but it won't. What the fuck was

559
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:35,420
that? I don't have a serious problem with this fucking forklift. Why do you like to drive this

560
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:44,920
thing? It's awful. You're just a forklift guy now. It's the home depot theme. You know what I love

561
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:51,880
about this forklift piece of shit? Sometime in the space future decided that normal boxy forklifts

562
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:56,279
didn't cut it anymore. They had to like overcomplicate the design to make it look

563
01:13:56,279 --> 01:14:02,680
like a giant fucking VR headset. All you really need is the fork part, right?

564
01:14:03,319 --> 01:14:07,960
Yeah. Why does it look like that? What's all this stuff here? This is, this is a, uh,

565
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:16,760
what's the thing? What's the thing that cleans the ice? Uh, the Zamboni. Yeah. I'm trying to get on,

566
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:24,890
on the forklift here, but again, I'm just, it was right. Oh fuck. Not like that. What is this

567
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:30,569
coffee pasta right now? What is going on? There's like a horrendous coffee pasta going on. Yeah.

568
01:14:30,569 --> 01:14:37,289
In mine too. Hang on. I have no idea what this, what's going on here. I don't know what started

569
01:14:37,289 --> 01:14:44,630
that. I, but it's taken over everything. Something about, I have something about going to the,

570
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:51,989
I don't know. It's a Taco bell and wiping your ass. I don't, I have no idea. Oh God.

571
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:02,810
What's the funniest injury, injury you've ever sustained in real life?

572
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:09,779
Funniest injury I've ever sustained in my real life. Yeah. Uh, probably when I, um, was,

573
01:15:09,859 --> 01:15:16,260
I don't know, probably like 12 years old and me and, uh, my brother were playing, um,

574
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:24,739
like karate fighters on our bed or on a big pullout mattress. Yeah. Karate fighters. Yeah.

575
01:15:24,739 --> 01:15:32,260
We, we, we, we were really into like the ninjas and like karate and it was ninja turtles and

576
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:38,260
power ranges was like big and everything. So he ended up, we were just doing like fake kind of

577
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:44,020
like, you know, like the punches and kicks and stuff. And he, this was like in 94 to nine or

578
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:50,899
something. Yeah. So he accidentally during our just very, it was not, we were not trying to hurt

579
01:15:50,899 --> 01:15:57,619
each other. It was just, he went, he went too far forward on the bed and I got like actually

580
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:04,260
slightly kicked into like the chest area, uh, which made me fall flying back off of the, uh,

581
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:12,100
pullout mattress. And I hit the back of my head on the fireplace and I had to get like six staples

582
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:22,340
in the back of my head. Jesus. What about you? Well, uh, I have a, I have a couple of funny

583
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:29,939
injuries actually. I, um, I, I learned a lot about like, uh, the body, uh, well, weird quest here,

584
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:34,100
but anyway, I learned a lot about like how, how, how your, your, your blood works and shit like

585
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:40,819
that. Uh, must've been like 10 or whatever. And me and my friend, um, uh, we were biking and, uh,

586
01:16:40,819 --> 01:16:48,020
coincidentally, uh, super hot that day, had our shorts on. I, uh, I was thrown off the, uh,

587
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:54,500
the bike and look on the street bumper, whatever it was. Right. And I immediately thought that

588
01:16:55,220 --> 01:17:01,720
what's the best way of like sustaining a fall? Oh, I used your niece. And you know, it was like,

589
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:07,880
the who rock slides they do on stage where they just kind of go with her knees, like scraping on

590
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:15,800
pure asphalt. Uh, I did like a whole meter. Where were your shin pads? Where were your shin pads?

591
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,479
Um, so what happened was, and he, he has the, he has the morbid pork leg. Um, my friend

592
01:17:24,279 --> 01:17:33,239
just took off because they didn't want to deal with it. Well, we, uh, he took off. He didn't

593
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:38,840
want to deal with it. So I walked home to my mom and then, no, no, no, I was hardcore, man.

594
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:44,199
I w here's the thing. I'm so shocked. I was so shocked on what had happened that I, I, I came

595
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:49,399
home and I, I didn't realize like the, the, uh, the full, uh, grasp of what had happened.

596
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:55,479
Yeah, exactly. So I came home and I, I expected my mother to be like sympathetic, like, oh my God,

597
01:17:56,039 --> 01:18:05,479
Joel. But she kept screaming at me. God. And I remember, uh, it was really bad, but the worst

598
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:10,359
part is this is like, I was just setting up a funny story here. I'm like puking my ass off.

599
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:16,739
But anyway, um, the point being is that I learned that you have like yellow goo in your knees.

600
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:28,340
Oh, these things are, these things are called fat balls. And yellow guck came out of my niece

601
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:37,939
and everything was fine. Really. It's just one of those, one of those things where the joints

602
01:18:37,939 --> 01:18:46,500
kind of bend. I'll make, I'll make this torture stop. But the funny part is this basically, uh,

603
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:50,579
I was a big boy. They put me down in the, on surgery or they just stitched me up,

604
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:54,659
really. But, uh, they kept, uh, popping popsicles in my mouth to shut me up.

605
01:18:55,699 --> 01:19:02,949
That's when I can never eat popsicles again. Holy shit. I've never heard. And you know what?

606
01:19:02,949 --> 01:19:09,430
Here's the worst part of what you just said. Um, I, I like, I somehow, I don't know why,

607
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:13,670
but I know what you're talking about. I don't even, I shouldn't, but I, oh yeah, that makes sense.

608
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:20,229
Like, oh, we have like platelets and shit and like proteins and fat and stuff. And so I, uh,

609
01:19:22,819 --> 01:19:32,039
Oh God. You want to know even funnier story? I want to sustain brain injuries from, uh,

610
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:42,020
from playing halo online. Is this, is this like a new injury? Is this a new injury from recently?

611
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:48,090
I just saw you run it. It happened three seconds ago.

612
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:56,859
You know, when you're playing a game and you're like, there's no consequence or like

613
01:19:56,859 --> 01:20:03,819
anything anymore. You're just like, you're just like on autopilot running forward. That's so fun.

614
01:20:04,779 --> 01:20:12,250
Just make it stop. There was some fucking, we were talking before, before, uh, on stream,

615
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:18,550
you said there was some story that I should have saved for, um, for the stream. What the fuck was

616
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:23,270
that? What was that? There was, there was, there was a thing to talk about. Some, some bullshit,

617
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:30,470
some bullshit. Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. So we've been trying to set up some shit to stream for

618
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:34,710
weeks on end. We were going to do Pogo stuff and all that stuff. Okay. And here's the thing. Here's

619
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:39,189
our work, Jerma. I need to like not walk around in games about the life story because I can't

620
01:20:39,189 --> 01:20:47,189
multitask. I'll be the gamer. Okay. Okay. Well check this out. So I thought, I thought that

621
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:52,310
Jerma was seriously super into halo. I don't know where this fucking came from, but I thought,

622
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:55,909
cause we were trying to set this up. Jerma messages me and say, you want to play halo?

623
01:20:56,550 --> 01:21:02,470
And I say, sure. Cause I know you asked the thief workers too guy. I thought you must have been

624
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:07,750
like drowning in pussy back in the halo days. Like you must have been suffocating in the amount of

625
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:12,550
like puss. And I was afraid of actually playing with you. I thought this is someone who's been

626
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:20,149
playing like halo since it came out day one. Uh, so I actually got anxious even hitting you up about

627
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:26,949
it. I'm, I was thinking I'm going to get slaughtered online. This it's going to be humiliating. And I

628
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:34,869
was just so intimidated by it. And then today I call you up and today I call you up and you say,

629
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:41,270
I've never played halo in my entire fucking life. Yeah. What you're seeing right now is the first

630
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:51,529
time I've ever actually sat down and truly tried to play it. And I gotta say, pretty fun, pretty

631
01:21:51,529 --> 01:22:02,260
fun game. It's, it's kind of like going to the dentist. I was going to make some sort of smart

632
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:08,779
analogy, but I'm like, nah, fuck it. I dropped that. I mean, we, I love dentists. He's speaking

633
01:22:08,779 --> 01:22:11,899
my language. That's a grenade. I tried to pick it up off the ground. Are you fucking kidding me?

634
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:22,390
Idiot. These guys, after this, these guys are going to be gone.

635
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:32,279
You know, when I said that we should probably play something else together, just be like,

636
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:36,119
play some bomber, man, a superintendent or something like that. I started off making that

637
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:39,239
joke, but now I actually like, I'm thinking about it. I'm like, dude, I probably have more fun.

638
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:48,520
I mean, this game isn't bad, but it's like, it's, it's like, I'm sedated. I mean,

639
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,439
I'm going in for surgery or something. Like I'm at the dentist. They're putting the fucking laugh

640
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:56,680
mask on me. Like, you know, Hey, you want to go clean a room in viscera cleanup detail?

641
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:14,229
Yeah, sure. I got the sword now. Wait, we did it. How long? Question of that's us.

642
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:21,220
If the question is when will the station be back on? I don't know. I don't think so. That's how

643
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:27,859
German gets you. Yeah. He brings up, he brings up two minutes. This is why I'm splicing into the

644
01:23:27,859 --> 01:23:33,800
main overland bundle to get you a direct line to colonel Holland. You're in my life. All streams

645
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:41,319
end in viscera. That's true. Find out what she knows. You ever stuck your arm in a drain pipe?

646
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:49,449
Wait, what? What's your name? Your arm in a drain pipe? Do you live around here? How does your arm

647
01:23:49,449 --> 01:23:55,210
fit in a drain pipe? Like what kind of, what kind of drain? Have you, have you ever like got in so

648
01:23:55,210 --> 01:24:00,409
much hair in the, in the, in the shower drain or anything like that? And you had to like buckle up

649
01:24:00,409 --> 01:24:07,210
and become a big boy and reach down into your shower drain. Yeah. And just get in there.

650
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:12,090
Yeah. You don't, you don't make snakes for that, right? Where you like snake it down and pull up.

651
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:19,930
You don't have to use your hand. Snakes? Yeah. Drain stakes. You slide down into the drain,

652
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:23,850
you move around, you pull it up. She needs a full, you're talking about contraceptive.

653
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:32,470
She's not the only one. No, it's a snake. It's a snake that it's a drain snake. Thank you, sir.

654
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:39,029
Like a hand condom for like, no. All right. Let me up. Okay. Is it device? That's you just,

655
01:24:39,029 --> 01:24:44,869
you pulled my leg here. It's device. I'm still going to say, are you saying, are you saying

656
01:24:44,869 --> 01:24:50,630
D R A A and snake? Are you saying train snake? What are you saying? I don't understand your

657
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:59,189
English drain. D R A. Okay. I thought you were saying train the snakes drain. Like there are no

658
01:24:59,189 --> 01:25:04,470
rebels. And then I'm like, he can't be saying that he must be saying something else. He's just

659
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:12,229
saying sort of like affirmative armor for your fucking arm. Like drains. Oh no. You, you said

660
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:15,670
that you reach you. All right. You opened the conversation. You said, Hey, you ever reached

661
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:20,149
down your drain? And I'm like, no, he's a drain snake. And then you're like, what are you talking

662
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:23,909
about? And I'm like drains. And now that here we are, I thought you were saying train snakes,

663
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:30,699
trains, train snakes. Okay. Listen, listen, this game is not good for us. We're fucking dropping

664
01:25:30,699 --> 01:25:34,779
like the last few brain cells we have. Oh, I lost those above two or three years ago. They're gone.

665
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:42,890
I want you to recite what the fuck happened in that cut scene drama. Okay. No, seriously. Yeah.

666
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:50,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. I, uh, somebody was kneeling down, fixing something for a second.

667
01:25:51,399 --> 01:25:57,159
They handed in like the machine. I, if you paid me $10,000 and said, I'm only going to give you

668
01:25:57,159 --> 01:26:04,760
$10,000. If you can tell me one sentence or even a small retelling of what that cut scene was,

669
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:11,720
I wouldn't be able to do it. I would not be able to do it. I got such, my brain is hurting so bad

670
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:17,319
from that conversation. I would actually in a Mandela confused attempt to say there was something

671
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:27,079
about like master chief came over and like unclogged my pipes. That's all.

672
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:36,680
I couldn't pay attention to the story because and look, we're doing it again.

673
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:40,119
We're doing it right now and we're not paying something about team noble.

674
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:44,680
Intervention to help secure sword base. Oh, right. Wait, what are you? All right. So

675
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:47,720
let me ask you a question. We're stuck with that shit for the time.

676
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:53,239
A little difficulty in host or do you, or do you hate this guy? Tell you what,

677
01:26:58,039 --> 01:27:07,979
this game is giving me cataclysmic diarrhea. If we continue, we need to stop.

678
01:27:08,699 --> 01:27:14,460
Six. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna die. If I keep playing this, my brain is hurting.

679
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:31,560
I can't do this anymore. All right. So what, anything, what would I just headshot that guy

680
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:37,399
like 10 times in a row? Let me guess. Let me guess. If I paid you like $3 billion,

681
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:43,159
you would say that halo reaches a game where master chief gets cataclysmic diarrhea.

682
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:49,289
Yeah. Is that, this, that's a fun game. I actually like it. They have, you know,

683
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:52,810
it's the worst part of this. This is the only time I'm going to be playing halo reach and I'm,

684
01:27:52,810 --> 01:28:00,409
I'm an old man on my death bed. How old are you? Like for real? Like how old are you? Not,

685
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:03,850
not like you're like, this is what I say on Twitch. How old I am, but I'm actually like,

686
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:07,050
no, I want you to, I want you to embarrass yourself. How old do you think I am?

687
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:15,689
How old do I think you are? I'm going to say, well, I mean, you've, you've made,

688
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:21,289
you've made up at least one or two Nintendo 64 references that I've seen. So there's no way that

689
01:28:21,289 --> 01:28:28,489
you're, you're, you're older than 20, 21, 22. You're probably, I don't think you're 30 though.

690
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:37,800
I would say, yeah. Yeah. I'm going to say 27. Close. I'm a little younger. A little younger?

691
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:47,210
Oh, much younger. How about this? 25. If I told you that I seriously thought you were 43,

692
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:59,689
would you believe me? Right. Wait, what? 43, 43. Okay. I don't know if you're asking,

693
01:28:59,689 --> 01:29:06,970
if you're shocked as in like, what the fuck? Like, are you, are you, are, are what happened to you,

694
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:12,090
Joel? Or are you asking, are you saying 43 as in like, I'm a little younger than that.

695
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:20,810
No, 43 as in like decade off. Okay. Cause I thought he would like, well, you know,

696
01:29:25,369 --> 01:29:31,130
40. How old do you really think I was? Okay. Uh, I'm fucking, I don't know, 53.

697
01:29:35,659 --> 01:29:41,579
If I was actually 53 years old, I would talk like this. It would seriously be like this. And then

698
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:45,340
that's, this is the only way that you tell that somebody's like over 45 years old is if they

699
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:49,579
speak just like this. And this is their actual speaking voice. This is how they talk. Like if

700
01:29:49,579 --> 01:29:57,829
you're 50 years old, it's just how you talk. So, I mean, my voice sounds like this, young, elegant,

701
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:05,430
smooth, slightly, slightly moving towards. You know what I love about you? You know what I

702
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:11,029
love about your voice? You describe your own voice as it is a cigarette filter. Ironically, you're

703
01:30:11,029 --> 01:30:15,989
saying like, you're, you're fucking putting it on. You're, you're old as fuck, man.

704
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:19,750
You're basically walking, talking nicotine.

705
01:30:22,579 --> 01:30:29,020
Smooth, elegant, may have failed quite a few classes in high school, but still made it.

706
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:39,829
Barely. You're not wrong. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. What's your opinion on vaping?

707
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:52,630
Um, well, as a gamer, as a lifestyle choice, I think it's important that we, um,

708
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:59,609
I was going to give you some shit, but I gave up. Um,

709
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:13,539
are you asking me seriously what I think of vaping? Yeah. Yep. Um, I mean, uh,

710
01:31:14,899 --> 01:31:18,979
what the fuck do you want me to say? Choose your words more carefully next time.

711
01:31:19,699 --> 01:31:44,090
Loki. Are you like a big vape gamer? I think I'm going insane. I think I'm going insane.

712
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:51,050
I'm fine. Oh, by the way, I feel like I've been sitting in the same spot on the same side of the

713
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:57,289
map for like an hour and 10 minutes. It wasn't happening. I feel like this game is like what

714
01:31:57,289 --> 01:32:02,090
they call us like old timey, like VR goggles, but it's like one picture and you switch it out

715
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:11,819
like, what do you call stereo, stereo, stereo, stereoscropic, uh, 3d with the blue and the red.

716
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:21,239
No, like viewfinder. I'm talking like 1920s, like entertainment, a view master view, view master.

717
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:25,560
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It feels like that where there's like five pictures that you just kind of

718
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:29,960
cycle around. There's no, no change. And you just like nothing changes, but the scenery that's this

719
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:35,659
fucking game. Legendary difficulty. I saw somebody write, Hey man, you probably shouldn't have done

720
01:32:35,659 --> 01:32:44,020
legendary difficulty. Cause I like how the story there is, we had to, we have to be like the gamers.

721
01:32:47,689 --> 01:32:52,489
Do I vape? I don't know. I don't vape and neither does Joel. Good. That was awesome. Put that in

722
01:32:52,489 --> 01:33:04,119
somewhere. Listen, I don't like, I don't like that you're assuming that you know me. All right.

723
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:08,199
Do I not know you? Actually, I realized I don't fall. Actually, you're right. I don't know you at

724
01:33:08,199 --> 01:33:16,140
all. I know you very like, you know, I don't fucking vape, but all right, thanks.

725
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:22,390
Are you vape? Are you drinking vape juice right now? Is that what you're doing?

726
01:33:23,189 --> 01:33:28,630
Am I drinking vape juice? Yeah. Do you ever, do you know about a thing called Jinkum?

727
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:33,430
I don't know what that is. You don't, you don't know about Jinkum, Jerma?

728
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:37,189
I know what Jenga is. The game where you pull blocks out until the house falls down.

729
01:33:39,109 --> 01:33:43,189
Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you what, tell you what, if you want to read, but

730
01:33:44,069 --> 01:33:49,510
emphasis on read, but, uh, Jankum is, uh, the stream is done. You want to know my official

731
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:55,270
stance on, on vaping, check out Jinkum. All right. I'm kind of scared to do that.

732
01:33:56,069 --> 01:34:01,989
No, no, it's, it's, it's, it's good and clean. What is this? What does the ordinance do?

733
01:34:01,989 --> 01:34:10,380
Get the hell off my lawn. Did we write this, this piece of dialogue? So is, is this like a,

734
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:19,100
uh, these are, okay, I see you can either have sprint or the armor thing. Did you get the armor

735
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:27,079
thing? Uh, not really. Where the fuck did you go? Oh, there's items. There's like materials.

736
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:34,630
Oh fuck. I remember this fucking level. Hang on. Wait, no, no, no, no, no, for real. I'm not

737
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:42,359
kidding. This is the level where, where, um, shit is being shot at you constantly. Oh, it's so

738
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:50,310
annoying. This level, not good. No, it's awful, man. You, you gotta, you, you can have sprint or

739
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:56,090
back pain. You have to like watch out in this level constantly. It's so annoying. Oh no, they

740
01:34:56,090 --> 01:35:03,300
locked me up. They fucking locked. No, no, no, wait. Oh, you're locked out. They put me behind

741
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:16,710
the fucking thing. Ordnance. Okay. I'm dropping a bomb on this thing. Check this out. Oh my god,

742
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:24,180
damn it. I didn't even get to see the thing I did. Hey man, you probably shouldn't have done

743
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:29,130
legendary difficulty. Why am I just lying? What are you talking about? We're having, we're having

744
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:40,300
the fucking time of our lives. Where am I? Hey man. Hey man. Uh, just so I ask, you probably

745
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:44,140
shouldn't have done legendary. Hey man, just want to let you know, what am I doing? What is this

746
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:54,949
power move thing? Doesn't mean. Uh, give me the health. All right, so this is, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

747
01:35:54,949 --> 01:36:00,789
leave this up to you. You, you have the big red button in front of you and don't, you know, press,

748
01:36:00,789 --> 01:36:05,510
don't press it yet until you find out what it is. I know it's big and shiny and you want to smash

749
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:12,390
it right now. But that big red button in front of you is, is the, is the out, get out of halo,

750
01:36:12,949 --> 01:36:18,789
like, get out of halo and open up viscera cleanup detail. That's what the big red button is.

751
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:31,829
Want to make sure you're having fun? No, I'm having fun. All right. You watch out, dude.

752
01:36:34,949 --> 01:36:41,720
Oh, I'm having fun. All right. You should have just played dragon quest builders.

753
01:36:42,439 --> 01:36:48,310
So this is like a recharge. I'll tell you what, next time we fuck to play something,

754
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:54,739
it's not going to be fucking halo. Okay. Well, all right. This, this was like the big launch.

755
01:36:54,739 --> 01:37:02,869
This is like the big launch game with co-op. My, my asshole fell off.

756
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:10,890
He's going to get killed. All right. Just take out that. You've got the button in front of you.

757
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:14,810
If you, I'm, I don't have to, I'm not pressing the button yet. You can press the button if you'd

758
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:22,119
like. It's there. It's, it's just, there he goes. Okay. Hang on. Oh, I'm on top of the, uh,

759
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:29,060
the tank or whatever. Oh jeez. You get on it. They're trying to shoot you. They don't get it.

760
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:35,319
Oh, I did it. I did it. I'm driving it. I think I'm driving it. I, I,

761
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:45,770

762
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:53,340

763
01:37:53,340 --> 01:38:10,939
Oh, I don't know. So I blacked out. All right. One different weapon. When is halo one going to come

01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:41,050
We've got, we've got aliens plus one letter grade. Yeah. Has this game like destroyed your like

766
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:47,539
ambition to ever play a yellow game again? No, no, I wouldn't say so. All right. Activate anti-air

767
01:38:47,539 --> 01:38:55,159
guns. I don't think so. Whoa. Would you give, would you give halo three online a shot? Cause I

768
01:38:55,159 --> 01:39:04,680
guarantee you it's a way more fun experience. Yeah. I'm having fun. I'm having fun. I just,

769
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:09,560
I just saw in my mind, I just saw Joel's hand just hover over that button and just like,

770
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:26,600
he almost pressed it. Wait, what happened? What up my head? Why did we go? What happened? We just

771
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:35,460
started over. Why did it be the stream rewind? What's the, why is the stream rewinding?

772
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:40,420
Why are we reliving that? What the fuck is, okay. This is actually kind of freaking me out.

773
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:48,680
Okay. I'm trying to find some entertainment. I'm trying to find some desperate entertainment.

774
01:39:52,229 --> 01:39:58,409
Okay. Well he's going to press it. I, I, that's the, he, that's the, that's the press the red button

776
01:40:04,579 --> 01:40:10,550
He's going to press it. He's going to press it. You know, let's, let's, let's listen. It won't

777
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:16,810

778
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:21,720
the fucking thing. You made this button up. You, you call the shots. What are you fucking talking

779
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:30,149
about? No, no, no, it doesn't. Why are we back here? What? Oh, the lag. Oh, all right. Wait,

780
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:36,859
this is us. Wait, hold on. Your desk just opened and another green button just opened to the right

781
01:40:36,859 --> 01:40:43,319
of the red button. The green button, if you press it, gives you host and we load the difficulty.

782
01:40:46,779 --> 01:40:55,060
What button is that? It's the green one. The green button just opened. Red button is get out of

790
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:52,250
the blue button turns off your stream and you go to Wendy's. All right. What do you got? We're

791
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:57,100
going to, okay, let's go to your stream. Are you on my stream? Hold on. I know when you're on the

792
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:01,989
stream. Tell me when you're on the stream. I'll tell you. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

793
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:07,909
All right. I am. All right. People that have the squad up, just look at, just look at the other

794
01:42:07,909 --> 01:42:12,069
screen. All right. Here we go. Okay. Okay. You have the audio on. Yeah. I have to stop talking.

795
01:42:12,069 --> 01:42:17,270
No, this is a, this is an old video of a kid playing halo. That's all I gotta say. Wait,

796
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:25,779
hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Why? This is not even correct. I'm on your Twitch,

797
01:42:25,779 --> 01:42:32,069
right? Why is this a different person? What are you talking about? Dude, that was strange.

798
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:39,289
Are you, is this, is this, are you streaming right now? I am streaming. What are you talking

799
01:42:39,289 --> 01:42:47,260
about? Are you serious right now? Where did Jerma go? Am I watching an ad? Is this an ad?

800
01:42:49,829 --> 01:42:56,789
Oh, it's an ad. It's a fucking ad. It's an ad of streamers talking on camera. I was like,

801
01:42:56,789 --> 01:43:06,810
who the fuck are you? I'm like, I'm on. Jerma, I gotta say something. I literally clicked on

802
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:11,130
your stream and I opened it and it was like, chat is there and there's some girl that's sitting in

803
01:43:11,130 --> 01:43:14,649
the chair. And I was like, is this the stream? Is this video? What's, what am I watching? I was

804
01:43:14,649 --> 01:43:17,369
like, is this the stream? Is this video? What's, all right. Now I got it. Okay. I'm going to stop

805
01:43:17,369 --> 01:43:22,810
talking. Okay. So you're good. Okay. I don't know if you know this. Back in the day, there were,

806
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:27,930
this is back in the day video from like a hundred years ago of this one kid that really wants to

807
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:34,329
play the green halo. All right. Now for context, for this stream,

808
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:50,090
that's my answer. That's for the button. What? No, you wait. You pressed the, did you press the

809
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:56,250
green button? Well, that's your answer, but you have to press it. You have to actually make the

810
01:43:56,250 --> 01:44:04,359
motion and press it. Oh shit. I pressed it for you. See, I got tons of buttons, but you don't

811
01:44:04,359 --> 01:44:09,000
understand is I've got on every live stream that I've ever done. There's like 25 different buttons

812
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,760
here. And I sometimes forget what they are. All right. You know what button I want to press right

813
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:27,739
now? All right. Let's go. Stop streaming. Okay. Let's try this one more time. All right. Well,

814
01:44:27,739 --> 01:44:31,899
that button, did you press, they said you said green button. The blue button was stop streaming

815
01:44:31,899 --> 01:44:36,310
and go to Wendy's. The green button was this for cleanup detail. Which button did you press?

816
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:42,069
Yes, you know, I do. I'll fuck it down. That needs to press this fucking discord call right now and

817
01:44:42,069 --> 01:44:46,630
just fucking get it over with. It's a fucking mistake. Talking to this person. I don't know

818
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:51,430
who this fucking person is. This has been a miserable experience. I just want to play halo.

819
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:55,750
I just want to play halo with one of my buddies. I, that's all I wanted. I just want to play halo

820
01:44:55,750 --> 01:45:00,550
with one of my buddies. Okay. Okay. Let's just fucking play some halo. All right. Hang on. Okay.

821
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:04,539
No, you already, you already pressed the button. You pressed the button. Okay. Well, the fucking

822
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:23,420
button is pressed. I just want. How do I leave the game? Are you still here? Unfortunately.

823
01:45:26,939 --> 01:45:32,329
Okay. That was halo reach just came out on screen. If you could check it out,

824
01:45:32,329 --> 01:45:40,380
maybe you'd think it was fun. Do you even have this reclaimed detail? We did this yesterday.

825
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:46,380
This is like the game that we go to. Hang on. Hang on. Do I, do you even own the game?

826
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:51,449
I got to see if I do. Surely I have that. Hang on.

827
01:45:53,909 --> 01:46:02,329
Oh, I have this right. Clean up detail. I have this right. Clean up detail. Shadow warrior.

828
01:46:03,050 --> 01:46:08,279
Yeah. Do you have the original one? No. How do you not have the original viscera?

829
01:46:09,159 --> 01:46:14,180
Fucking, I don't know. What do you mean? He said, wait, he chose green. Wait, green was.

830
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:17,539
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. What was the, what did the green button do?

831
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:21,699
Well, it's your fucking body. You made them up. Hold on. The red button was to.

832
01:46:22,579 --> 01:46:26,890
Dude, did you, did you choose lower difficulty and get host and halo?

833
01:46:27,529 --> 01:46:33,189
Or did you choose exit halo? What did I press? Sorry.

834
01:46:33,189 --> 01:46:36,949
Jeremiah was like getting into my gamer hole there for a second. What the fuck was he saying?

835
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:41,130
What was he saying? Joel cut the blue wire.

836
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:53,420
Lower difficulty. Okay. Well, so we're playing halo now or. Oh God.

837
01:46:55,689 --> 01:47:02,569
I love this. This is fucking awesome. All right. So I'm going to look, we've, we're, we're,

838
01:47:03,529 --> 01:47:09,609
let me ask you, would you like just no fucking messing around? No jokes, no comedy.

839
01:47:10,489 --> 01:47:15,689
No. Would you like to continue to play halo straight up straight up? Let's play some halo.

840
01:47:15,689 --> 01:47:21,369
Do you, would you, the answer, the answer is no. Nope. No, bit bopping. Okay. Straight up.

841
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:33,060
All right. Just halo. Halo. All right. So the answer to that is no. Fuck this game.

842
01:47:41,909 --> 01:47:47,210
Okay. So, uh. I don't want to play any more halo, dude. Like if I play more halo,

843
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:50,489
I'm going to have fucking, I'm going to start vomiting. All right. Out of my school.

844
01:47:51,369 --> 01:47:59,960
I can't do anymore. All right. Quick follow up question. Okay. Hold that thought just for a

845
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:03,319
sec and just keep it in the oven. All right. You know what fucking game we need to play?

846
01:48:03,319 --> 01:48:07,960
I realized that we are the most inept ever. Our brains are not aligned at all to interact

847
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:12,119
with each other. We need to play that fucking bomb game. You know, when you got to defuse a bomb,

848
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:19,699
don't keep talking. And then we would be killer at that. Like right now,

849
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:32,229
not right now, but at some point that would be the most bad yes stream ever.

850
01:48:33,779 --> 01:48:37,939
That would be so bad. People are saying, okay, why don't, why don't, why don't we just do it

851
01:48:37,939 --> 01:48:49,029
right now? But let me, I, I, let me ask you this question. Um, did, did you want to play halo

852
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:57,619
at all from the very beginning? Were you, was, were you just humoring me that whole time?

853
01:48:59,449 --> 01:49:04,899
It started off with you were setting these buttons scenarios for me and there was some,

854
01:49:04,899 --> 01:49:09,380
something about Wendy's in there. But then I thought about something about the drain

855
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:13,779
pipe and you training snakes and that's steer me off the fucking road for a second.

856
01:49:13,779 --> 01:49:18,899
And then you watched my stream and you mentioned there was another streamer on my stream. So I said,

857
01:49:18,899 --> 01:49:22,899
okay, I'm clicking out. I'm talking out of this situation. All right. And then at some point,

858
01:49:22,899 --> 01:49:29,800
you started saying, do you want to lower the difficulty? And I said, no, no. And then I said,

859
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:36,760
I don't want to play anymore. I want to, I want to go take a nap. I don't want to do this. So

860
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,960
you thought this was going to be so easy. So, all right. So let me back up completely all the

861
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:51,319
way to the very beginning. We're talking to two hours ago, or even like four days ago, five days

862
01:49:51,319 --> 01:49:58,760
ago. Right. Okay. Okay. Hey, you, so you want like, let's play halo. You're thinking, oh, this guy's

863
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:03,079
just a halo channel. He's fucking knows what he's doing. Like, well, that's what he does on his

864
01:50:03,079 --> 01:50:07,399
channel. No fucking point, German. Did I refer to you as like, oh, this guy's a halo channel.

865
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:13,319
Like I might be stupid, but I'm not a fucking amoeba. Right. I have some brain cells jumping

866
01:50:13,319 --> 01:50:19,560
around in my, my big peanut. All right. Like you, you think, you think I, I, I'm in a coma.

867
01:50:20,279 --> 01:50:24,840
You think I woke up one day and I said, yeah, German's a halo channel. Like, yeah,

868
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:29,479
maybe you played halo down the line, but at no fucking point did I interact with you over the

869
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:36,199
years. Yeah, he played halo all his life. What the fuck? Think before you speak. What are you saying?

870
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:41,479
Hey, you're talking about reaching into the toilet and like pulling up like drain pipes.

871
01:50:42,119 --> 01:50:49,289
All right. So what are we doing? What do we want? What do you want to play? I'm going to play.

872
01:50:50,090 --> 01:50:56,729
I want to, um, I don't know. I want to play, uh, bomber man on super Nintendo. Um,

873
01:50:57,770 --> 01:51:01,529
the ball game. We keep talking. Nobody explodes. That sounds like a, that sounds like you. Well,

874
01:51:01,529 --> 01:51:06,970
let's see. Okay. Keep talking. Oh my God. Oh, I own this. Do you own this?

875
01:51:09,779 --> 01:51:16,500
The, the expo game. Yeah. Do you own keep talking and nobody explodes at the moment,

876
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:23,579
but I have a great idea. Check this out. Right. You've heard of a game called thief workers too.

877
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:39,020
You can't, you can't. Well, answer the question gamer. All right. You can't,

878
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:43,260
you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't go. You can't, you can't. Okay. Like if I invited you

879
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:46,300
into my house, right? If I was like, okay, come over my house and I got all, I got all these

880
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:52,060
trophies. So wait, so, so, okay. I got a bunch of bowling trophies. You're like, hey, you're a bowler.

881
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:58,390
Huh? Jerma calls you over and says, Hey bro, you want to fill my gamer hole with some video games?

882
01:51:59,029 --> 01:52:07,159
How do you respond? I would first say, Hey, could you please reevaluate the question?

883
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:22,140
What is a gamer hole? It's your eyes. All right. I'm about to install keep talking and nobody

884
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:28,939
explodes. This stream sucks ass. This is honestly, this is, I love this street. This is like my

885
01:52:28,939 --> 01:52:35,340
favorite stream. All right. I'm about to install keep talking. All right. No, you know, I just

886
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:41,930
pressed the green button. No, no, no, that's halo. I'm pressing the, uh, all right. I'm gonna ask

887
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:45,720
you straight up. Do you want to play keep talking and nobody explodes right now? I'll tell you what.

888
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:51,239
I'll tell you what. Like dropping, drop. No, this is not a fucking, this is not, this is not a

889
01:52:51,239 --> 01:52:55,640
fucking thousand questions. This is not a conundrum. This is not a fucking story. Just hear me out.

890
01:52:55,640 --> 01:53:04,680
All right. Without any fucking irony, without no sarcasm, no waterfall of diarrhea, diarrhea is

891
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:15,399
is she commenting stuff. Here's the facts. All right. Let's play some games at some other point

892
01:53:15,399 --> 01:53:20,840
because it's 3 AM and I'm about to shit myself. All right. All right. So you pressed, you pressed

893
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:26,039
the Wendy's button. Okay. All right. You pressed, you pressed the stop streaming button. I see.
