1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,570
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerema here with some Facecam Fortress 2, Episode 2, 2, 2.

2
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:26,300
Dead. Nope. This is Episode 2, Facecam Fortress 2. How many times can I say 2 in the same sentence?

3
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,869
Alright, let's destroy some people with the Huntsman. What do you say?

4
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:37,570
Playing on Gold Rush, of course.

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,570
Oh, you moved, you son of a...

6
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,899
Come on, thank.

7
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,899
No, no, no, no, I don't want to die. Please don't kill me.

8
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:51,039
Shhh, he doesn't know I'm here.

9
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,500
Oh, come on. Boing.

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,810
I need health. Bad. Bad to the bone.

11
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:09,319
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bad. Bad to the bone.

12
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:15,859
Ooh, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, big problem.

13
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:16,859
How did that not hit him?

14
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,359
I need that health. Get it before the soldier does. What a selfish bastard I am.

15
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,359
Wait a minute. You are still alive, probably.

16
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,609
I guess not. I guess not.

17
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:36,400
Take that to the bank and cash it.

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,769
Oh, ho-ho. Oh. Today is a good day to be a Huntsman.

19
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,659
Maybe not. Nooooo.

20
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,900
Only the good die young. And I was old. So I should have died.

21
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:59,510
Dude, I think it's like a ritual. Whenever I do one of these live commentaries like this, I have to have a cough drop in my mouth.

22
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,010
I don't know why. I really don't know.

23
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,079
I do the same thing on live streams, too, though.

24
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,819
You need that slippery stuff in your throat to make sure you can keep talking.

25
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,210
But I think... Oh my god, that guy was right in my face.

26
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:23,139
Give me the health. Give me the health.

27
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:28,569
I should have went for the sniper.

28
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:31,939
Dude, what are you doing, man?

29
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:38,960
Damn it. Get that heavy. Wow.

30
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,020
Ah, there we go. I can't believe I missed that heavy.

31
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:52,139
They're gonna get... We had them pushed at spawn, and they're gonna cap it now.

32
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,280
Come on, peek your head out. There it is.

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,479
Peek your head out.

34
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,430
Come on, now. Come on, now.

35
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:11,740
Walk into that. Walk into this stuff.

36
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,620
I'm just gonna... You know what?

37
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,590
Oh, ho-ho. God.

38
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,300
Anybody coming around? I don't want to get backstabbed right now.

39
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,060
What is my loadout? Peek your head out.

40
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,379
Oh, this guy is coming for me.

41
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,379
You're coming for me, alright. I can see you.

42
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:43,389
Come on, hit somebody right... Oh, no.

43
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,870
No, I should have held it down longer than that.

44
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,360
Oh, ho. I need to get health.

45
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,240
Need to get that health.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,180
Looking right at you. I just like... I sweeped across.

47
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,150
That's not... This guy is trying to kill me.

48
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,889
I'm just being such a pest.

49
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,770
Oh my god, I'm being such a pest.

50
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,779
I'm gonna hit that guy in the face.

51
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:22,220
There's one in the face.

52
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,339
Maybe I can stay alive the whole round.

53
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,120
That would be ideal.

54
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,509
Oh, ho. Goodness gracious.

55
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:41,779
I got no more bullets.

56
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:45,480
Um... Maybe I can run over one of them.

57
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,149
No, that's a bad idea.

58
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:53,149
I need to get... See, this is the only place I know that's like a close...

59
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:58,459
Thank you! I'll take that.

60
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:01,410
I need the health that's in there, too.

61
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,899
Oh... Gotta keep this up.

62
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:11,889
I thought that... Sometimes that happens to you.

63
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:19,420
Two... Give me a three.

64
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,279
And I got killed.

65
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,899
Dang it!

66
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:32,899
Unless they push forward, I think we're gonna hold the line pretty dang well.

67
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,779
What am I using?

68
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,779
I do have the razor back on. What if I have...

69
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,410
Put the danger shield on.

70
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,410
Stick with that.

71
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,740
Stick with that, Jack.

72
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,610
You better listen, Jack!

73
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,870
Who wants to come in the window? Come on.

74
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,870
Come on, who wants that doggy in the window?

75
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,870
Oh!

76
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,879
How much is that doggy in the window?

77
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,120
Woof, woof!

78
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,120
The one with the waggly tail.

79
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,490
I'm stuck on your cart!

80
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,420
That was my bank statement!

81
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,720
How did that stain get there?

82
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,920
Get away from me. I don't want you anymore.

83
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:28,730
See, right at this point right here when the cart is right there...

84
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,459
It's pretty damn hard to not die if you're a Huntsman Sniper.

85
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,459
Unless you stay all the way back, like back here.

86
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,829
And that's what I'm gonna do.

87
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,519
There's a headshot, but he doesn't...

88
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,579
Aww!

89
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,290
Take that, get outta...

90
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:58,129
Can't believe I missed.

91
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:59,129
There's a medic.

92
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:04,959
Nope.

93
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,959
I think they actually might win this.

94
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:15,470
It's not looking super, super hot right now for our team.

95
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,120
Oh, boy.

96
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm trying to pull off a little snazzy move right there.

97
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,459
Hi, soldier!

98
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:32,689
Mmm...

99
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,660
I thought I was gonna get that spy for sure.

100
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
That's a death wish.

101
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,819
I gotta get away from that.

102
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,589
That's not a death wish, though.

103
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:51,029
I'm alive!

104
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,029
Something about the Huntsman tonight, guys.

105
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:56,810
Something about the Huntsman tonight.

106
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:03,379
Pick your head up.

107
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,000
No!

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,139
Oh, he got me.

109
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,139
Should've been more wary about that guy.

110
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,209
Wary, wary, hold on.

111
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:18,209
Somebody...

112
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:22,209
I said weary in one of my last videos.

113
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:26,459
And somebody said it's actually wary?

114
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,459
I got 49 points right there.

115
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,629
Holy crap.

116
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:32,629
So I was wary of the situation.

117
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:33,870
Right?

118
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,870
I think.

119
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,870
But anyways, that's gonna wrap up this Facecam Fortress 2.

120
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,870
Saturday's edition.

121
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,870
Go enjoy the sun if it's sunny.

122
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:50,360
If it's rainy, then fruit cup or a hot tea.

123
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,620
Some other things you can do when it's not sunny.

124
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,620
But yeah, take care, guys.

125
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,620
I'll see you all soon.

126
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,620
And take care, everybody.
