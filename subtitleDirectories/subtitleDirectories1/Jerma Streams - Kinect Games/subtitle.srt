1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:10,470
Hey, why is everybody still saying late? I don't understand that anymore. I've had a window between

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:17,690
three and four o'clock pacific for like six months. What are you guys talking about? I'm pretty damn

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:28,679
early. You never had a goddamn guy come to your house in a window before?

4
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:44,340
Um, somebody like a worker coming to your house in a window. No, I'm talking, okay, a guy

5
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:52,200
comes to your house because you asked him to come there because he's doing a job and he gave you a

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:23,319
window of when he will arrive. There you go. All right, I'm here. I have to kneel down because I

7
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:27,719
have to, I don't have a chair in here right now because as you probably saw by the title of the

8
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:39,780
stream and by the latest tweet, we're doing connect. That's right. I have way too many

9
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:49,620
of these games. It was a mistake to buy this many. Half of these I don't think have seen.

10
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,060
Well, okay, let's put it this way. The one that I'm about to start with, I don't think has seen

11
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:06,260
total playtime across the entire globe from every purchase, probably more than 16 hours of time that

12
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,020
anyone has ever spent in this game across the whole globe. I can't, I don't know. I don't

13
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:18,500
understand who would, maybe we are going to account for like 30% of this game's total global playtime.

14
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:28,120
Hope you're ready. It's not Forza. Why would I, I'm not going to play Forza right now.

15
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:46,199
Is Forza for connect? Because should I have gotten Forza instead of the biggest loser

16
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,759
weight loss game? I don't, what do you think?

17
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:01,300
We're talking fucking weight loss today. I'm in my gear. I'm ready to work out.

18
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,699
This stream is going to probably be like fucking two hours because you all know how much stamina I got.

19
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:22,759
I warmed up before. I did a little bit of like stretches and setups and stuff. I'm ready.

20
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:35,289
I'm ready for at least play online. You can't play this game online. No camera? Oh there you go.

21
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:40,729
Absolutely there's a camera. It's going on. Not yet though. It's only been like a minute.

22
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:50,759
Just waiting. I just did a tweet. I got a cool setup this time. So those of you that watched the

23
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:57,319
movies one from a few days ago with the Xbox live vision camera. No, no, no, no. Today.

24
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:06,310
Take a look at this. Today I've got something interesting here. It must have been sad for a

25
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:15,050
minute there. I got something interesting here. Wireless Bluetooth setup. Wireless Bluetooth setup

26
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,199
from here. No wires. Check that out. No wires. Nothing on me at all.

27
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,290
Let me see. I got a Bluetooth setup over here. I mean it's like in Rome.

28
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:35,029
It's not like ah get that off. No, no, no. I'm good. It's connected. I had no way to put it.

29
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:42,180
I was going to get a haircut yesterday but I didn't do it so the hair stays. Wait how does this look?

30
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,860
I really don't want to turn this on because this music is fucking terrible but

31
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:59,720
it's on. Check this out. Yeah that's right. It's been calibrated I think.

32
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,949
Okay yeah it's been calibrated. Oh I gotta hold on. I gotta flip my because if I go like this.

33
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,439
Yeah I gotta flip. I gotta flip myself because it's pulling me the other way.

34
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:31,720
Hold on. We're gonna we're gonna mirror this because now there you go. All right so uh put

35
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:41,180
the fat suit on. I'm not gonna put the fat suit on for this. Guys we don't get time to fuck around.

36
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:51,529
You understand? I don't have time to fuck around okay? I knew that was gonna fucking happen.

37
00:05:52,569 --> 00:06:01,720
It's all right. They're fine over there. I got 40. We got 40 games for the Kinect. It's gonna take

38
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:14,790
us like six weeks to do this. I just spit all over you. This was four grand. There's a lie.

39
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:30,120
Red. I'm stalling. It's time to go. This was not four grand. That's a lie. All right here we go.

40
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,860
You ready? It's time. Is this what you do? No. All right here we go. This is the bit. This is

41
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,259
the worst one to start with but I have to get rid of this one quick. By the way we have a rule here

42
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:47,449
if you've never been here before. Every single one of these games I have to play for at least

43
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:53,779
30 minutes. What time is it right now? Seven minutes. Start the timer now. Biggest loser.

44
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:58,709
Here we go. Wireless Bluetooth setup. I have to like get it like to like calibrate it. Okay.

45
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:08,180
Enter your weight. Use the up and down arrow to change your weight.

46
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:17,060
No no no that's not that. Are you ready to have fun and get real results?

47
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:38,149
I'm ready. This is so difficult. All right I'm like 154. Hey uh take the CD out of the tray.

48
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:46,230
You don't have to fucking be here. Okay let's go. Imagine being 154 pounds and like getting

49
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,350
this game. Be like you know I've got I gotta drop like 40. Choose a personalized program if

50
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,029
you want a custom fitness program tailored to your body and your personal strengths and weaknesses.

51
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:59,029
Creating your program will begin to test the gauge of your current fitness.

52
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,750
What'd you do? No no no no I want to do the custom one like the like the Wii Fit one.

53
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:14,939
Personalized program if we're going to test my current fitness level. Sounds good. 30 minute

54
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,819
hey that's just as much time for me to fucking uninstall the game. Fitness test is going to find

55
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,620
your current fitness level. Just follow Bob Harper as he leads you through a series of exercises.

56
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,620
If it gets too hard for you the test will end and we'll look at your results. Okay good luck.

57
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:42,700
Thanks for giving me that time. Here we go. Fitness test starting now. I'm going to stretch

58
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,379
my spine out. Here's a quick little technique for those who don't know. If you want to stretch

59
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:53,299
your spine out go on your tip toes real fast. Okay I elongated my body. Now we're going to do

60
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,940
a short fitness test with you to find out your current fitness level. You can end the test at

61
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,740
any time. Take it away Bob. We'll start with a light warm-up exercise but things will get

62
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,539
progressively harder. Remember that you can stop at any time if things get too difficult.

63
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:11,539
The test will end automatically if your performance drops below a certain level.

64
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,659
Let's go. All right I can't I gotta I gotta be good.

65
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:22,059
Arm swings. Move your arms around in big circles in a nice controlled way.

66
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:29,399
Oh I don't know if I can do this Bob. Try to do controlled movements and you won't put stress

67
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:42,279
on your joints. All right I burnt one calorie. It's time to end the game. Why am I blue? Let's

68
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,039
move on to some side steps. Oh no not side steps. Make sure you don't make your steps too wide.

69
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,200
Listen Bob I don't know if I can handle this. You might have to call the test early.

70
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:08,070
Perfect form. I do this shit like lying at fucking like fast food restaurants. I just like

71
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:16,169
I can do this all day. I'm a fidgety fuck. This is too hard. I'm keeping up. This is too hard.

72
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:20,409
I'm keeping up. I'm feeling good. Try to keep working even if you have to drop to a lower

73
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:25,289
intensity until it's time for a break. Oh that was me saying that to Bob. Okay Bob. I know you're

74
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:39,100
working hard. I can see you. This is too hard. That's exactly what I'm after. This is for like

75
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:45,850
all ladies. Good job. Keep that rhythm going and just march on the spot. Arms and legs move

76
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,250
alternately. This is a nice and easy way to warm up your entire body. Stay with it.

77
00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:02,620
Try to land your feet softly. Don't stand. If you could move your arms a little more for me

78
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:09,860
that would be great. All right Bob. I got spinal problems. I can't do this. If you're going a little

79
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,740
slow just keep going and when you feel ready move more arms like the people that walk.

80
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:25,850
The people that like are on the sidewalk that go like this. Move your legs a little more if you

81
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:35,289
can. What do you mean knee higher? You guys don't even need the fucking face cam. This exercise will

82
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:41,080
get that heart rate up. Faster isn't always better. Make sure you're matching your trainer and

83
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,720
concentrate on perfect form. Good job. Keep that rhythm going.

84
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,879
This is actually the last time I get a little winded. I've only burned eight calories. Don't

85
00:11:51,879 --> 00:12:00,330
forget that going too fast will count against you. Fuck that man. I just eat one less bag of potato

86
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:08,580
chips every day. Just do that. How many calories in a bag of potato chips? You've done the light

87
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,500
warm-up. Are you okay to continue to the first light exercise? It's like 325 calories for one

88
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,340
bag of Lays potato chips. If you just didn't eat the bag of potato chips you wouldn't have to do

89
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:27,830
this whole exercise. Thinking face. You know what I'm saying? All right let's go. Start the light

90
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:42,340
station? What the fuck is that? Wood chops.

91
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,409
Don't be thinking about swinging down. Place the arm over your shoulder. Does this shit

92
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:16,059
work? I don't think this works. Yeah I'm feeling it. That burn means that you are working those

93
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:27,860
muscles hard. I'm not feeling good at all. I don't feel anything. I would laugh my ass off.

94
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,299
Okay now let's get on there. Get on the ground. Let's do 150 push-ups. You can do it.

95
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:49,190
Do you got any weights? Go get two 50 pound dumbbells. Hold them over your head and scream.

96
00:13:53,379 --> 00:14:05,529
Hold that form. 30 minutes. That's all the time we have for in this one.

97
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:16,490
Oh thank god for the cooldown period. Arms up in boxer position and sway from side to side as if

98
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,929
you're ducking and dodging punches. Dip down as you sway and try to keep it nice and rhythmic.

99
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:26,840
Don't dip too low as you might overextend your knees.

100
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,080
Pick it up. Think how proud you'll be if you get this right. I don't think it would be very

101
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:44,679
probable. Try to reach the same speed as the trainer to prevent the exercise. Burn major

102
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:57,980
calories and earn maximum points. Try to duck down lower if you can. So anytime you see like

103
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,019
a fitness exercise video this is great. Do this in your spare time. Go to any of these old

104
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:07,899
fitness instruction video things and watch like the people in the back. The people that are in

105
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:11,899
the front row right because they really this is a camera really in front row. I'm like oh look at

106
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:24,009
that there's that lady. Holy shit look at my face. Hold on. Wait a minute. We're staying at a low

107
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:50,059
intensity with this exercise. It looks like you're moving from side to side a lot. Try to stay in

108
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:59,860
one place more. I think it's like a bad enough. I know I'm fucking wrong. To perfect the exercise.

109
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:08,700
Burn major calories and earn maximum points. A little quicker. You're going a little slow.

110
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,940
Just keep going and when you feel ready you can try to pick it up a bit. Anyways what I was saying

111
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:18,779
is the people in the back all the way in the back they're always doing it so fucking wrong.

112
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,860
Follow your training movements exactly in order to do well. Even something as simple as like running

113
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:36,419
in place like this they'll go like this. Oh fuck. I feel like we're 20. I feel like I've burnt like

114
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:57,240
2000 calories. Work out on us hard. I'm not gonna get over that. I wish I could get a close up.

115
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:13,400
Why is my nose so big? My nose is not this big. What the fuck? Oh shit.

116
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:20,359
And back behind again as you drop your hips. What am I? I can't see. What's he doing? To avoid

117
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:27,240
stress on your lower back. Good. Keep it up. I don't even know what. I'm flapping my arms down

118
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:35,720
here like a bird? Perfect. That's what I'm talking about. It's talking to me. It's talking to people

119
00:17:35,720 --> 00:18:04,309
behind you. And release. And release. Breathe out as you lift your hips. Faster isn't always better.

120
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:09,829
Make sure you're matching your trainer. Oh thank god for the cool down. Let's mix things up with

121
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:14,630
something else now. No I don't want to. I want to get up. My spine. I got a bad spine. Now come back

122
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:24,470
into a plank position. Okay I can do that. And now let's go side arm. Let's do some hip extensions.

123
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,829
Stretch your left arm out in front of you and at the same time extend your right leg out behind you.

124
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:34,309
What do you want? What? Now pull your arm and leg back in together keeping your hips level. Now

125
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:42,329
stretch it back out again. Keep your hips in line with one another. If you're going a little slow

126
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,809
just keep going and when you feel ready you can try to pick it up. I think I need a drink.

127
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:55,269
I think I need a drink. Let's take a few seconds to rehydrate at the end of the exercise

128
00:18:55,269 --> 00:19:06,230
then we'll continue. Okay. Good job guys let's move to the other side now. I'm drinking soda at the

129
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:23,029
gym. What kind of dickhead are you holding everybody up? You good man? No not yet. Hey

130
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:36,180
well there's uh there's like 37 other people in this class. Wait I'm good. I got my drink. Go

131
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:45,769
class. This thing ain't got shit on the Wii mode. I'll tell you that's why I failed. Turn to the

132
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:58,470
side for this exercise. So take the other leg out and extend the other arm forward. Come on.

133
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:06,150
Squeezing into your glutes. I don't want to get on the ground. I don't want to get on the ground.

134
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:25,460
The ground is dirty. Fucking dust and dirt on there. To succeed follow your trainer's movements

135
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:42,329
closely. All right. How did we do? Tendon de Rangoon. Tendon de Rangoon. Oh shit what

136
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:49,500
happened here? My wireless setup got fucked up. All right best exercise the march. Worst exercise

137
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:55,740
proficiency. Let's see. Hold on I got this got fucked up. I gotta change this.

138
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:05,289
That's better. Okay you performed really well and reached the moderate level. That was a great start.

139
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:14,500
All right. 106 points. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off quick. Turn it off.

140
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:30,569
What are the games do I have? Too many. How is this the biggest loser? This is just like a shitty

141
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:43,349
workout game. What year were you born? Should I say I'm like fucking like 100? I'm going for it.

142
00:21:43,349 --> 00:22:01,059
I wanted to do the intense workout today. All right let's say I was born in like 1921. Interesting

143
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:07,619
choice. Nine two one. September 21st carnival stream. Make sure you get some uh make sure you

144
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:19,450
get there if you want to see some fun. Uh when was I born? I don't know. Fucking March. March 1921.

145
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:34,470
Well it just stopped like fucking data mining me. This is the biggest loser body analyzer.

146
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:41,720
Body analyzer. With our revolutionary full body analysis system. Good luck in there. Okay.

147
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:49,930
You need to remove your. Welcome to the biggest loser body analyzer. To get the best results

148
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:56,009
from the analyzer you will need to remove your shoes. Why? Clothes fitting clothing will also

149
00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:08,180
help you get more accurate results. When you're ready select continue. Okay please stand in the

150
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:16,630
outline. Okay with your feet together and your hands away from your sides. Arms up like this.

151
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:42,309
Turn to your left and raise your arms to max the outline. That's not right. That is inaccurate.

152
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:46,630
That's inaccurate because of where I'm standing. I'm not fucking five four.

153
00:23:47,829 --> 00:24:02,569
This is from like 2006 guys. The technology didn't exist. Waist hips 31. I mean that's accurate.

154
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:15,369
Neck 163. Hold on like how big is that? 163 inches? That's like a fucking bullfrog.

155
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:30,200
That's not correct. Place the tape around your neck and adjust below the. I don't know it's I

156
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:37,079
whatever you did it I didn't. You changed that fucking height. That's not accurate.

157
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,900
Now it's fucking accurate. It's bullshit and it's because of the way this is pointing.

158
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,740
Video games are stupid. You shouldn't have don't play them anymore. All right I'm ready.

159
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:12,410
Analyzing tone and strength. Stamina. Fitness. The overall fitness training program will help

160
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,490
you lose weight and improve your fitness and increase your stamina. My focus should be on my

161
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:28,579
butt or what does that mean? Full body. Choose your own program. Choose your own muscle focus.

162
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:35,450
No no no. What is the one we need to focus on? It's it. You know it said I had a great ass.

163
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:49,579
I'm that's not me saying that. That's the game. Right? Yeah. Let's go. Next step of the body

164
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:54,089
analyzer. How'd that work out for you? Thank you using the biggest blizzard body analyzer.

165
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:57,049
We can start my work towards your goal. Maybe you can return to the body analyzer any time. All

166
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:08,410
right. Have it's been 30 minutes? Not yet. You're gonna laugh when I put the next one in.

167
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:17,589
You're gonna you're gonna hate me. People gonna leave. Hey Tended Dragoon 74 welcome to your

168
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:21,509
fitness program. Your calendar shows you what you did yesterday. What you'll be doing today

169
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:24,950
and what you'll be doing tomorrow. The icon under today shows that you have training schedule.

170
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,789
You can log out now and resume at a later date. That's not good. That's not encouraging.

171
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,670
This is supposed to be a fitness program. It's supposed to be a fitness instructor.

172
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:40,549
You don't say oh hey you could start today. Oh you know you could come back like another day.

173
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:47,029
Just turn it off. Oh you can log. Just get me to log out now. Yeah I guess I could log out now

174
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:52,680
and then I'll just put it back in the shelf and I'll never use it again. All right what's the

175
00:26:52,680 --> 00:27:10,299
activity? I got like four minutes. Routine lengths. Choose your personal trainer. Jilly Michaels.

176
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:27,849
60 fucking plus minutes. I'll be sure to get the fuck out of here soon. If you crave chocolate go

177
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:31,369
buy some fat-free sugar-free chocolate pudding. Sprinkle a little cocoa powder. I need to get that

178
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:37,000
real chocolate taste and you've got a great chocolate treat. Never ever give up on the

179
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,240
thought of a thin you. Always have a thin you. I'm just going to tell you what to do and you're

180
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,920
going to do it. When you listen to me and you do what I say we're going to get along just fine.

181
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,720
Knee strikes. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Turn to one side. Raise your arms and as

182
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:57,460
you lower them strike upwards with your knee. Then do the same on the other side. Keep your

183
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,059
knee and arm movements nice and controlled. Try not to move your hips too far forwards as you strike.

184
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:11,369
That's it for this one. Feeling tired yet? Bad. This is too hard. If you keep pushing you're going

185
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:22,519
to feel so much better about yourself. Coward. Come here fuck coward. I'll show you. That's I

186
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:27,210
wanted that's not Jillian Michaels. I wanted Jillian Michaels. That's not is that Jillian

187
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:45,539
Michaels? I don't think it is. Jumping jack. I think I got lied to. I don't think that was

188
00:28:45,539 --> 00:29:40,220
Jillian Michaels. We'll fix that don't worry. Am I red ringing here? All right okay. I feel

189
00:29:40,220 --> 00:30:13,690
like I was lied to in that last one. Coming up next. Now they can't lie to me. Hi I'm Jillian

190
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:18,730
Michaels and welcome to my fitness adventure. Using the power of connect I'll be following you

191
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:23,450
every step of the way. I'll be following you everywhere in your house. Each exercise safely

192
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:28,809
and completely. No cheating. With this new fitness adventure mode I'll be watching the leaderboards

193
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:40,579
to see who comes out on top. Now let's see if you have what it takes. Connect tuber. It's time.

194
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:45,619
Jillian Michaels. Stick your right arm straight out and raise it up and down to highlight a menu

195
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:52,660
button. To make a selection swipe your right hand across your body to lock it in. To exit any menu

196
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:59,750
use your left hand and swipe across your body. Who cares? Give me a new fitness test and I want

197
00:30:59,750 --> 00:32:07,910
you to redo my height first. I got it. I got it. You can see me just fine. Oh what the fuck. My

198
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:25,670
sides. All right what a stupid fucking way to navigate a menu. Why would you ever have like.

199
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:39,130
Let's start by recording a few personal details. Get the fuck out of here. Male age 20 and I'll

200
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:44,970
look at how youthful I am. I must be so youthful looking. Age 20, 5'9", 140 pounds that's inaccurate.

201
00:32:45,609 --> 00:33:12,890
But I mean come on they got everything else right. I'm gonna change that. BMI 22% body mass

202
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:27,640
percentage index. I'm gonna keep it at 20. What are you saying? I'm your weight at 6'3". From this menu

203
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,480
you can choose between fitness training, fitness adventure, fitness adventure and options. Fitness

204
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:40,039
no what about stats? No fitness adventure. Trek into a mysterious temple with Jillian as your guide.

205
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:45,240
Move as fast as you. Yeah oh yeah we'll do it as well. Here you can check out your prog. No stop

206
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,960
doing that. Use the buttons on the right to cycle through each month to see more details on your

207
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,039
progress. You can also choose to see your progress from the very beginning by choosing all time.

208
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:25,929
Back. Go back. Okay just I'm using control. Can I control me? Okay we'll do an adventure. Here we go.

209
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:31,530
I'm ready. This is it. Select an adventure circuit on the right hand side and get ready to trek

210
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:38,170
deep into the jungle temple. Squat jacks, side lunges, water pumps, back kicks. Which one?

211
00:34:54,969 --> 00:35:04,500
Water pumps do lunge front kicks. Huge kicks. Ball scales. Power jumps. You can preview the exercises

212
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,699
used in this adventure. Choose a warm-up routine before you get started or jump right into the

213
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:14,500
adventure if you've already warmed up and you're ready to go. No no no we're getting hurt.

214
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:26,780
We're getting fucking hurt today. Did you warm up? Yeah and I'm gonna go like do some weird

215
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:33,099
movement like eee. Pinch of nerve. Bonus medallions. When running pick up medallions by sticking your

216
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:37,900
arms out to the side or above your head. The green medallions are good and will lower your final time.

217
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,139
Watch out for the red medallions. These are bad and will add to your final time. Sure.

218
00:35:42,619 --> 00:36:06,599
Do the little guy down there that has to pick these up? I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.

219
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:29,619
Lunge front kick. Left leg first. All right let's move it.

220
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:50,780
Open the door. Get those feet moving and your heart pumping. What if I just pretend to take my foot?

221
00:36:51,260 --> 00:37:16,489
Get around forever. I can't trick it. Get on me now. Keep going. I know you can do this. I'm doing the exercise right.

222
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:36,949
Get moving. I'm just fucking running. I'm gonna wait around forever. I'm too close. Stay focused.

223
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:56,460
Very nice. Can't somebody just get a fucking log and run into it.

224
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:14,630
Know you're tired but don't even think about stopping. Get the fucking door. All right open the door.

225
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:39,989
Don't quit on me now. Keep going. I know you can do this. Let's move it. I'm gonna take it out of the tray.

226
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:11,670
But you gotta keep moving. Fuck you Jillian Michaels. Open the door.

227
00:39:25,750 --> 00:40:33,539
What? Leg first. What is that move? What? I know you can move faster than this. Hello? Watch your form.

228
00:40:34,500 --> 00:41:11,590
Don't go too fast. Watch your form. Nice. Get those feet moving and your heart pumping.

229
00:41:12,550 --> 00:42:06,099
Is that working? Let's just walk. All right. It's been five minutes. I feel like it's been 30.

230
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:27,849
It's been 30 minutes. That was fun. That was fun. It's been 30 minutes. Butt kicks. We're gonna start

231
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:37,639
with the right leg first. This is easy. This is a Fortnite dance. I can do this one. If you want to

232
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:46,550
make it to the end, you have to keep moving. It's a Fortnite dance. I can do this one. Very nice.

233
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:55,750
Don't quit on me now. Keep going. I know you can do it. Don't phone this in every single second of

234
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:27,500
your exercise time count. Got one. Stay focused. Finish strong. Yup. Quit on me now. Keep going. I

235
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:44,099
know you can do it. Watch your form. Don't go too fast. Watch your form. Happy birthday surprise.

236
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:58,679
This is the gif that plays at the bottom right hand corner of a fucking meme video.

237
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:11,880
Get those feet moving and your heart pumping. Okay. Jelly, I'm done. Jelly, you just drained me.

238
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:13,800
Stay focused.

239
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:33,829
I ate a fucking tuna sandwich before this. I'm full of protein. I'm good.

240
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:40,250
I had to tune a casserole. You got through it. You should be really proud of yourself right now.

241
00:44:40,889 --> 00:45:09,820
What'd I get? I'm covered in water right now. Next level. Now I don't see the fucking leaderboards.

242
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:32,840
That's number one in the world. 14. Never mind. Back. How do I say back? I'm the 1482nd most

243
00:45:34,119 --> 00:46:05,880
strongest man in the world. I do this one again. All right. That's enough. Wireless mic.

244
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:13,780
I gotta get it in there by the way. Thanks for reminding me. No, I'm not. Take it out of the

245
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:29,179
fucking disk. I'm not doing this shit again. Hold on. This is like. Okay. That was fun.

246
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:48,150
Don't really though. All right. Let's fucking get out of this shit. I'm done with that. No more of

247
00:46:48,150 --> 00:47:06,309
this bullshit. Moving on. This one's a little case. Let me get it out. All right. That's enough of

248
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:25,880
that. Time to do something different. That was a 47 minute workout. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What the

249
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:48,539
fuck are you doing? What the hell was that? Secure HDCP link lost? I don't think I can do

250
00:47:48,539 --> 00:48:03,380
this one. Well, fuck. That's annoying. Reboot. Reboot it. All right. I'm just gonna reboot it.

251
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:15,219
There is a very high chance, guys. I don't know what the exact probability of this happening is,

252
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:21,780
but this thing might break. I might burn out the 360 over the next like 12 hours of what

253
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:29,639
for these games. Okay. Here we go. It doesn't say it right here. It only says it when I load up this

254
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:33,239
next game that is actually probably for the best because nobody's going to want to see this one

255
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:56,179
because why would you? Is it fair food? Fucking bloodshed. The issue can occur if you confess

256
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:03,380
there's a home theater tuner of AV switch box between your Xbox. Well, I have to capture it

257
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:10,659
through a capture card. So maybe some of these. Let's try it one more time. Yeah. The 360 has to

258
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:14,579
go through a capture card. Otherwise, it can't go to the computer. No, it's not going to work.

259
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:34,900
Well, for the best. It was a workout DVD. Oh, well. All right. Let's actually move on to

260
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:42,900
something more than just like training. There we go. I'm fucking looking forward to this one.

261
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:56,659
All right. Let's hope that doesn't happen on like half of these. Don't touch the back of the CD

262
00:49:56,659 --> 00:50:06,230
with your greasy hands. All right. All right. Come on. Don't do that again. I think we're good.

263
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:19,190
We are. This is another compilation. The soda dehydrate you. I had to do it because we're in

264
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:26,090
the shirt. What if I just lifted up my fucking whole shirt and there was a huge Coca-Cola brand

265
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:37,079
logo tattoo right here? And it was fresh. You could see the irritation on the skin. It was like, ah,

266
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:50,889
and it was like a little thing across it. I got it like an hour and a half ago. Wait, can't identify?

267
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:58,539
Tender dragoon recognized. You've been identified as tender dragoon. Confirm. Yes.

268
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:11,239
I gotta make the face can't figure everything. I shrunk it. There you go. That's better. Memory

269
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:29,639
unit. Use that one. Use it. Yeah. Use this fucking one, please. Use that one. What was that? I get

270
00:51:29,639 --> 00:51:45,400
like buzzed. No. Just use the same one that you're already using. How many save files does a game

271
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:55,260
fucking have? All right. This is Motion Sports. It's highly rated. It's on every top 10 Connect

272
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:03,059
Games list you can find. There are two. There are two of those lists. You are now entering

273
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:09,699
the world of Motion Sports. Now let's get this puppy calibrated just right. Place your hand

274
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:15,860
over the top left virtual panel and leave it there for a few seconds. What hand? Left hand? I didn't

275
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:28,150
hear what he said. Left hand? And now place shoe on hand or pre-record it. Perfect. Now place your

276
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:34,940
hand over the bottom right panel and again leave it there for a few seconds. Great. You're a

277
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:42,300
natural. Finally place your hand over the top right panel and once again leave it there. Brilliant.

278
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:52,119
Now the fun begins. Hold your hand out in front of you and slide to the right. Why? Perfect. Now

279
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:57,400
we're going to take three photos of you as you would like the world to see you. No pressure now.

280
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:02,679
Okay. When you're ready to enter the photo shoot, hold your hand out in front of you

281
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:17,190
and again slide to the right. Ready? Okay. First photo. Throw your hands in the air like you just

282
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:23,429
don't care unless someone you're attracted to is around. Hold your pose until the camera flashes.

283
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:30,389
All right. Second photo. Pretend like you just won a million bucks. Hold for the flash.

284
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:38,570
Great. And now for the last photo. Show me your muscles. Wait for the flash.

285
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:47,820
Sweet. Magazines will pay gold for these. Great. Now let's play some motion scores.

286
00:53:48,860 --> 00:54:03,880
I don't do fucking anything else but this every time. Horseback riding is the first one we're

287
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:17,079
doing. I don't care. Beginner course. Beginner course. Is it going to be actually me on the

288
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:24,260
horse? Oh what a fantastic game this would be. This one's going to be boring. Oh he said boxing.

289
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:29,690
We're going to do ball. This is motion. I got like two or three other fucking sports. We're

290
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,070
not going to do those another time. I'm looking at that stack over there. It's going to take like

291
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:45,179
three weeks. This is going to take like 10 streams to do all this. Hey, you know what I'm saying?

292
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:57,699
Fine. Guide your horse. I didn't even see what that said. Why? Don't say slide to continue.

293
00:54:58,739 --> 00:55:08,409
I didn't even see what it said. Hello all. Today we're thrilled to bring you one of Equestria's

294
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:14,090
most brilliant performers. Maybe not the most stringent course he'll ever face but also not

295
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:20,650
one to take for granted. Really wants a great start. The rider failed to make a jump move

296
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:32,380
and his horse is refusing. How do you do that? Jump. Couldn't handle the simple vertical. It

297
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:41,400
cannot be taken for granted. Whoa. Hey, Magellan. The course is over here.

298
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:54,730
It didn't teach me how to play. How do you jump? Do I have to say something?

299
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:15,369
Horse refuses again. Do I have to jump? Am I controlling the horse too? Clean and solid.

300
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:41,940
Had that down behind. Jumps the wrong obstacle. He has to get back on course or he is toast.

301
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:57,050
Got it. Couldn't have been more perfect. Couldn't handle the simple vertical. It cannot be taken

302
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:06,230
for granted. At this level, horse and rider should not have a problem with the double jump.

303
00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:14,469
That is a bad man. This horse just loves the crowd. Look at him go. Tough moments here today

304
00:57:14,469 --> 00:57:19,030
for the highly respected Percy Wilson. But beware when he comes home to roost.

305
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:38,860
Holy shit. That's an awful picture. I'm one of the world. I'll take it. I want to go fast.

306
00:57:39,500 --> 00:58:02,179
All right. Well, that one sucks. That one's not fun. At TwitchCon, meet your favorite streamers

307
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:07,849
like Jerma985. That's like outside of the TwitchCon convention. That flashes like 15 different

308
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:31,719
people. This is the line to get him. What's going on in the back? I didn't take that one. New game.

309
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:41,980
And then it'll like flash a little video of me. It'll be like, Jerma985 is here. And it's me like,

310
00:58:43,739 --> 00:58:56,489
like, GTA like crash. All right. We're going to go. Soccer. For all of you, you're a bean football.

311
00:58:56,489 --> 00:59:12,489
I still want my fucking like, I don't know. So I still want like my underwear to fall off. You

312
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:22,840
know what I mean? Like I'm like secure. I kick a soccer ball and like my fucking pants. Why would

313
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:29,130
that happen? Oh, let me like play connect sports. But I freak article of lower article of clubbing's

314
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:43,179
off. Am I wearing like a pants that an underwear that is like 10 sizes too big? All right. Let's

315
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:54,889
go. Stop. Don't stop red ringing and let's go. Place the ball on the ground in front of you,

316
00:59:54,889 --> 01:00:06,090
bending at your waist. Step back, approach the ball and plant your non-kicking foot.

317
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:11,210
When the riding around the circle says shoot, kick with the other foot. Where did that ball go?

318
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:22,219
Okay. I got it. Honestly, what I shouldn't be concerned with is like shit in my pants.

319
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:28,139
For those who live and breathe the sport of soccer, today we bring you a definitive marvel.

320
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:45,820
First up in this penalty shootout, the talented prodigy smacks the ball against the upright.

321
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:59,500
Couldn't punch that last one through and now trying to keep them from going down early.

322
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:14,309
How do I? Is that supposed to die? The pressure of the fans, the pride of the competitors.

323
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:21,929
It makes for an electrifying competition. Go left side. I'm going to fake about going to go

324
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:33,369
right side and left. Can't allow himself to go down too far too early.

325
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:44,570
I was going, but Josh couldn't stop it.

326
01:01:45,050 --> 01:02:04,019
I'm looking him right in the fucking eyes. I'm looking him right in his eyes.

327
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:23,380
I went like this and I switched around. I did it with the left foot. I went like this. I went.

328
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:31,820
You wouldn't fucking expecting that. Down one, two.

329
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,860
She's got to feel a hit in the middle of her stomach right now.

330
01:02:37,269 --> 01:02:50,199
Just a patient looking a little nervous now, knowing how big this kick is.

331
01:02:52,760 --> 01:03:05,929
Just never on the approach there. It could be over in a few seconds if he can't save this.

332
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:36,309
Great instincts in the same missing here would give his opponent the match sneak it inside.

333
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:49,449
It's just a good pitch. A nice effort with just a few bumps and bruises along the way,

334
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:55,429
but you witnessed his natural talent. They got a pretty good me in the air.

335
01:03:56,389 --> 01:04:14,230
I need like a headband. When I go for my first break, I'm going to get like a

336
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:21,030
bandana or something like a headband. The same picture. Hey, welcome to TwitchCon.

337
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,909
Yeah, we only got this one motherfucker here. That's it.

338
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:29,530
And we're going to use the same photo. Meet and greets at four o'clock.

339
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,579
Wait, what's in the back? The back one too. What is it?

340
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:49,429
Welcome to the Narcissist Convention. You should really like this guy.

341
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:59,460
Now that's like in Vegas. They have all, it's getting like, oh, Donnie and Marie are on the

342
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:26,579
side of an entire fucking building. Aren't they important? What? Oh, I hope that's on

343
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:40,900
one of the billboards. That's your kid, Evo. No, no new emotes. No new emotes ever. All right,

344
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:49,610
that was football, soccer, whatever. Let's do, let's actually do, let's do American football.

345
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:58,710
Vertical run. I want to like do the quarterback stuff. All right, I have to win. What are you

346
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:29,929
saying? Unstopped. This is a running one. Okay. Jump and, jump and duck. I have to do this one

347
01:06:29,929 --> 01:06:39,619
well because I want to unlock the other game. I need like a better, cool score. This would be

348
01:06:39,619 --> 01:06:47,369
easy. Hey everybody. We thank you for joining us to watch one of the most spectacular phenoms in

349
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:52,170
all of football. Lots of barriers he has to try and jump and duck without touching.

350
01:06:54,010 --> 01:07:16,980
All right, wave one. Established a solid platform can now start reaching for those high scores.

351
01:07:23,769 --> 01:07:50,340
Why did it go twice? This is taking it more out of me than any of the other ones. The

352
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:55,860
Jillian Michaels fucking. A 2.2 kids in corner office in 30 years kind of guy.

353
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:21,000
All right, I did it. Smoking. Excellent showing with a decisive outcome. Great energy and focus

354
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,840
has him nearing his very best. Wait, I want to see how vertical I got.

355
01:08:36,569 --> 01:09:01,130
I got to turn the fan on. I need some cool air. Lateral run. Okay. Fucking narcissist, man.

356
01:09:08,699 --> 01:09:34,329
Who cares about that? They're not going to show up anywhere. Mugshot. Has it been 30 minutes on

357
01:09:34,329 --> 01:09:46,939
this one? The Amazonian dimple. Professor Tom. No? All right. Well, how much time we got?

358
01:09:47,659 --> 01:10:02,890
It's going to be another 15, 20 minutes. This is boxing. I got to be ready to fucking lay

359
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:12,579
somebody out. He better play everything. We're going to play everything. Don't you worry.

360
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:17,460
I have to clean up as we go though, because there's so many discs over here. I will ruin

361
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:22,579
the room and it'll be, it'll just be a cluttered, uncomfortable hoarder feeling in this room. It

362
01:10:22,579 --> 01:10:35,420
happens sometimes. Perry. Raise your hands in front of your face. Real quick straight punch

363
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:45,819
to the face of stomach. Throw a semi-circular punch to the head of the body. Do an uppercut.

364
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:50,699
What was Perry? Raise your hands in front of your face. Your guard can be broken if you keep

365
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:59,479
Perry without attacking. All right. So you just beat him up. For those who love boxing,

366
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:06,199
get ready to witness the dream. One of this sport's superior talents, the Amazonian devil,

367
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:11,800
very quick-handed opponent, loves the jab and really puts punches together well.

368
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:18,119
Doesn't have true punching power though. Look for the dream to take some of those jabs in order to

369
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:26,119
get inside and do real punching damage. And here goes dream, trying to end it all. Three knockdown

370
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:31,560
rule in effect. If it goes to the scorecards, landing a lot of blows and a high percentage

371
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:44,600
is key. Sucks in a jab and wobbling. Eats the stiff jab. Oh my. Takes a stinging jab.

372
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:50,600
Halfway through round one. Cleans up on it. Has him hurt and in trouble. That was enough.

373
01:11:50,600 --> 01:12:06,039
Trying to finish him. Heard him earlier with a hard left. Did not dream, not like,

374
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:15,430
push himself out. Now he's a sitting duck. Dream lighting him up. 10 seconds left in this round.

375
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:23,979
Oh, wobbles his legs. Dream delivering punishment here. Everybody has a plan

376
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:26,859
until they get punched in the mouth. I thought it was tactical lockout.

377
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:37,939
Three times you go down. That's TKO. Incredible conclusion to this fight. Unbelievable.

378
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:49,930
Wow. Dialing up a winner. A simply stunning performance. Brilliant. Extraordinary. Monumental.

379
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:57,960
That was spectacular. Not really, it really wasn't at all actually. It was pretty lame.

380
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:07,779
I'm telling you though, if you give me one of those machines, I will go over like 600,

381
01:13:07,779 --> 01:13:13,140
700, 800 pounds per square inch. One of those punching machines. We already talked about it.

382
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:30,140
You guys already know this. I will prove that one day on camera, I promise. No, more of this.

383
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:35,689
I don't even want to take these anymore. Where are they going? They're probably going to like

384
01:13:35,689 --> 01:13:54,329
fucking server somewhere. What do we not do? Hang gliding? They're going straight to my PC?

385
01:13:56,149 --> 01:14:05,960
Mine or yours? What do you mean? All right, we got hang gliding. Leaving the nest.

386
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:24,340
No, mine. Me. You just probably go to me. I'm out of here. All right, so how do we do this?

387
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:49,609
I guess I can't leave them. Oh, that's me. I did that. So I don't want to be disturbed while I'm

388
01:14:49,609 --> 01:14:59,210
playing Kinect. Okay, raise your left arm to turn right. These kind of piano hands. So piano hands,

389
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:08,439
lower arms to nose dive. Lift up. Tilt. Tilt. Like this. Okay, if you were going out of gaining

390
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:19,210
altitude. All right, I got it. I'm gonna sneeze. I tried to hold it. If you hold it in. Hello,

391
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:24,170
ladies and gentlemen. Today we bring you one of Gliding's outstanding virtuosos.

392
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:30,460
Wants to nail a solid landing after getting used to the air's thermal mechanics.

393
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:35,340
That's very, apparently it's very windy. I'm not sure what he was thinking.

394
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:41,720
Where am I landing?

395
01:15:55,239 --> 01:16:00,680
Oh, a sad showing from our developing star, but like all others with a great deal of pride,

396
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:28,310
he'll be back. I'll be back. Back from the dead. I don't like that one. I don't like that one.

397
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:45,960
I don't like this game. Holy shit. Somebody gave, somebody gave 69 subs.

398
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:55,079
BilacteryLich just gave 69 community subs. Holy shit. 69. You've done that twice.

399
01:16:57,369 --> 01:17:04,170
BountySuperG, SkiCross. I'm gonna do SkiCross. Thank you so much. That's an insane amount of subs.

400
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:10,170
And that is, like I said, the second time that you've done that. Thank you, Bilactery.

401
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:15,989
Congratulations to those who got the fucking community subs. That's a lot. That's hundreds.

402
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:31,579
What is that? 70. That is a lot of fucking money. Thank you, Bilactery. He already dead. They

403
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:39,539
already did the 420 thing. Four subs and then 20 subs. That's too many subs. All right. Push

404
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:45,079
poles on to start. So you just gotta ski. Bend your knees and transfer your weight to the left or

405
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:54,729
right turn. Right? High at skiing. When your first gauge is full, crouch down to speed up.

406
01:17:55,609 --> 01:18:07,909
Let's go. Go as fast as you can. Hello, everyone. Today we bring you one of the skiing world's most

407
01:18:07,909 --> 01:18:17,300
amazing talents. Blowing out the gates. The race is on. It's underway. Sitting in third place right

408
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:35,449
now. He's in fourth. What's going on? Why am I going that fast? Slingshots off the altar.

409
01:18:40,569 --> 01:18:57,689
That's some big air. Getting thrown down.

410
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:11,659
Hey, let's go to the on the field, Mike. Somebody just gave a bunch more subs.

411
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:25,579
And expect to win. Who gave the subs? Austin Atlantis. Austin Atlantis gave 50 community subs.

412
01:19:25,579 --> 01:19:43,029
Holy shit, guys. 69 and 50. Racers muscling for position. Thank you so much. Light of the gate.

413
01:19:43,029 --> 01:20:01,699
Big mistake there. I have to do something fucking crazy. Ridiculous jump. I should do that the whole

414
01:20:01,779 --> 01:20:21,779
time. That just stays a bowl. Did not finish. A capable appearance from him, but obviously

415
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:27,060
leaving some room. You see me doing the cry. Great talent. Watch it right there. When I'm leaning

416
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:41,829
this way, I'm doing the cry. All right. I think I've seen what I want to see in this one. We've got

417
01:20:41,829 --> 01:21:01,140
a lot more. Unless there's something. I want to see the quarterback one. Why do you have to put

418
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:10,680
these behind a time gate? I want to throw the football. To the back of the box. I want to do

419
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:38,039
the foot throw in the back of the box. I've got two horror games. I'm tired. I assure you, I'm not.

420
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:46,600
Yes, I am. Why did I start with the Jillian Michaels shit? I blew all of my energy in the

421
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:52,180
first 40 minutes of the stream. I knew that was going to happen. I'm going to get a second win.

422
01:21:52,180 --> 01:22:00,899
I'm good. I'm good. I'm going to be fine. Running back quarterback kicker. Hold on.

423
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:06,100
I want to see what that is. I have to. We're past the 30 minute mark on this now,

424
01:22:06,899 --> 01:22:18,039
but it doesn't matter. I have to. I have to throw quarterback balls. Am I desynced? I shouldn't be.

425
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:57,159
Let's test it. A bit. By how much? What's happening first? Audio is early. How's this?

426
01:23:03,029 --> 01:23:15,880
Oh my fucking God. Hold on. If I left here, let's just give 250 fucking. How much money have you

427
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:27,180
given this week? Give us a thousand dollars, dude. Oh my God. 250 bucks and 69 subs.

428
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:36,100
He's just like fucking dropping money. Thank you. Hey Jerma, I had a really good day today with my

429
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:40,260
father-in-law and wife. Want to share some bits with you. By the way, that paraglider is fucking

430
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:45,859
dead. He's not coming back walking. Well, thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.

431
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:52,500
Thanks for like the more than like 1500 bucks in the last week. That's insanity. Thank you.

432
01:23:55,770 --> 01:24:07,380
All right. Let me get this fixed. That's a lot of fucking money. So sound is early.

433
01:24:07,939 --> 01:24:36,550
So let me go like this. If I do this, does this help at all? Ready? Same? No. What the fuck is

434
01:24:36,550 --> 01:25:02,279
happening? Sound is... All right. Hold on. Ready? Better? Still, it's way too early. What the fuck is

435
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:32,649
happening? I wonder why. Ready? It's worse. It's way, it's way worse. Wrong direction. Now is it late?

436
01:25:32,649 --> 01:25:57,220
Now it's late. Computers don't ever have one. All right. How about this? What? That's impossible.

437
01:25:57,859 --> 01:26:01,739
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is important. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait,

438
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:18,630
wait. Check this out. Hey, ready? That can't be early. See, this is perfect now. But what I have

439
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:23,689
to do is see on the screen here. I have to, I have to pull. Why would that, why would, what's,

440
01:26:23,689 --> 01:26:28,250
how did that makes no sense? These are both the same millisecond. All right. Ready? Hold on. Watch

441
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:44,680
this. This shit, they're both at 650 milliseconds. Why would one be, I don't know. That makes no

442
01:26:44,680 --> 01:27:04,619
sense. That's perfect. Fixed. Good. Good. Fixed. That's exactly what it was before. It was 650, 650.

443
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:31,939
It was always good. You got baited. Are you fucking kidding me? No, not fixed. Let me, let me, hold

444
01:27:31,939 --> 01:27:37,380
on. I'm gonna, I'll be change game. I was gonna, what was I gonna do? Yeah, hold on. Let's change

445
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:51,340
game. Oh my God. I haven't done anything for 50 subs. I'm just walking around in a circle.

446
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:57,909
Hold on. It's time. It's time to move on to the meat and fucking potatoes of this stream. Are you

447
01:27:57,909 --> 01:28:07,960
ready? You, I, that was a spoiler. Don't look at it. Uh, Abe Cashem, Abe Cashem, thank, Abe

448
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:22,739
Cashem. Thank you for 50 more fucking subs. Holy shit. 50 subs. 50, 50, 70. You guys are fucking

449
01:28:22,739 --> 01:28:37,260
giving so much subs. Thank you. The connect is the path to money. No, there's no way this is out of

450
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:42,539
sync. It's impossible. The, the audio and the video are both set to 650 milliseconds. Delayed.

451
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:59,399
There's no way. It's literally technically impossible. Somebody give me a clip. I want

452
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:07,479
to prove this to the world and myself. Clip that. Let me see it. Right now.

453
01:29:08,199 --> 01:29:36,470
Let me see it right now. Why is nobody clipping that? Oh, by the way, we're playing fucking Harry

454
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:51,989
Potter. Just in case you were curious. It's literally technically impossible. Somebody give

455
01:29:51,989 --> 01:30:01,270
me a clip. I want to prove this to the world and myself. Clip that. You fucking dickheads.

456
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:16,250
Shit's perfect shit. It's fine. Uh, thank you. The, the wild, the wild ad, the wild. Thanks for the

457
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:34,039
wild. Appreciate the fucking 10 subs. I just watched the clip. It's very clearly and happens.

458
01:30:34,039 --> 01:30:38,439
I don't, it's over. It's fine. I got my fucking Bluetooth connection wireless setup. I'm playing

459
01:30:38,439 --> 01:30:55,590
Harry Potter for connect. All right. I got to get in here. Wait, just do it one more time.

460
01:30:56,229 --> 01:31:04,340
Click that right now. What the game? I didn't have the game behind me. I didn't have the game

461
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:06,899
behind me. Seriously. Somebody click that right now. I didn't have the game behind me.

462
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:24,260
I'm not clicking on that one. Click. I want the real one. Thank you. All right. I got to get in

463
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:49,300
here. I can't, I can't tell. I have no idea. I think it's, I think it's fine. I think it's fine.

464
01:31:51,239 --> 01:32:14,060
It's the connect. It's not unwatchable. It's like 0.5 seconds behind. No, it's not. I'm done. I'm

465
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:27,800
done. I'm done. We're just going. Everything's fine. There's nothing I can do to fix it because

466
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:32,779
there is no fix. It's the connect. And there's like a little quarter of a second delay.

467
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:39,000
There's nothing I can do to fix it. It's six 50, six 50. If I change it, it fucks it up. Just

468
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:54,310
relax. Okay. Select continue to play or signing. Okay. Raise hand. Welcome guest.

469
01:32:55,189 --> 01:33:03,180
Somebody's 50 fucking dollars. Can you give us a good expelliarmus? Oh, I'm going to give

470
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:09,779
you a good one. And that's another $50 and another fucking. That's your worth thousand dollars now.

471
01:33:09,779 --> 01:33:24,970
101,000 bits from phylactery. Holy shit. You've crossed the $1,000 in the month mark. Thank you.

472
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:29,880
For real. All right. Navigating menus. To move menus, skipping cinematics. Why would I skip the

473
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:39,430
cut scenes in a Harry Potter game? That sounds like a mistake. To move menus, to move menus to

474
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:43,430
the left, to hold your right hand out to the side and swipe to the left. I don't know these bullshit

475
01:33:43,510 --> 01:34:02,409
things. Let's go. New game. For those who enjoy an easier experience. No.

476
01:34:05,819 --> 01:34:09,659
Advanced. For those who enjoy a challenge. Is it just normal? Where's normal mode?

477
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:28,060
I'm not doing casual. We're going to do advanced. Harry Potter was living. Oh fuck. I'm sorry. I

478
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:35,500
just ruined it. His awful aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon. When on his 11th birthday, he learned that

479
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:42,300
he was a wizard and received a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and

480
01:34:42,300 --> 01:35:00,310
Wizardry. Yeah, I've seen the movie. I don't know that owl's name. I can't see from that far away.

481
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:05,500
Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform that you have a place in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft

482
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:11,500
and Wizardry. Please find and close the list of all necessary books and equipment. Turn begins on

483
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:18,380
September 21st. Make sure you go to the carnival street. Uh, we await your owl by no later than the

484
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:31,899
31st of July. Your sincerely Minerva McGonagall, deputy head mistress. Woolly mode? Custom mode.

485
01:35:32,619 --> 01:35:43,300
What is that? What's the difference? Does anybody know the difference?

486
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:59,420
Is it just, it just plays the movie? Custom mode. What's that? What's changing? Let's go

487
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:03,899
to Madame Malkin's to get your school robes and customize your character.

488
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:13,590
This is empty. God, you know what I wish this was? I wish this was a fucking skull crusher IPA from

489
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:26,020
Stone Cold Steve Austin. Taking a psycho. Move your head until it fills the head template. Sure thing.

490
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:33,399
We gotta get my robe on. Stand in front of that mirror, please. That's it. Now position yourself

491
01:36:33,399 --> 01:36:39,159
so that your head fits the guide as closely as possible. Excellent. My face is too fucked up.

492
01:36:39,159 --> 01:36:49,689
And we'll take a picture. Five, four, three, two, one. Looking good. Now feel free to try a different

493
01:36:49,689 --> 01:36:53,689
look. Where are my eyes? It's really not you. We can always take another picture.

494
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:07,779
Retake, retake, retake. I don't like that one. That's it. Now position yourself so that your head

495
01:37:07,779 --> 01:37:13,859
fits the guide as closely as possible. Excellent. Is it because I blinked? And we'll take a picture.

496
01:37:13,859 --> 01:37:25,500
Five, four, three, two, looking good. Now feel free to try a different look. Or if it's really not you,

497
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:33,420
we can always take another picture. I need one more. That's it. Now position yourself so that

498
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:40,220
your head fits the guide as closely as possible. Excellent. Just one second and we'll take a picture.

499
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:50,779
Five, four, three, two, one. Looking good. Now feel free to try a different look. Or if it's

500
01:37:50,779 --> 01:37:53,420
really not you, we can always take another picture.

501
01:37:58,390 --> 01:38:22,390
Try a different look. Oh my god. That one, that one's the best. Go back to that one.

502
01:38:31,479 --> 01:38:39,979
Where is it? There it is. Finished. Good luck.

503
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:47,800
One of the first things every young midshore wizard must get before going to Hogwarts is a wand.

504
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:55,289
All right, we're gonna get a, we're gonna get a wand.

505
01:38:58,699 --> 01:39:03,819
Trying a wand. Give a wand a try before moving your wand hand in a quick downward swishing motion.

506
01:39:04,779 --> 01:39:14,859
Okay, ring the bell. Just a minute.

507
01:39:15,819 --> 01:39:17,750
Hey.

508
01:39:19,029 --> 01:39:19,350
Hey.

509
01:39:36,869 --> 01:39:37,350
Distraction.

510
01:39:46,789 --> 01:39:54,710
You will never get such good results with another wizard's wand. Now let's get you a wand.

511
01:39:56,149 --> 01:40:03,510
Okay, cherry and dragon heart string. Nine inches. I don't like it. Don't want it.

512
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:14,979
Give me something else. No, I want to find something. Apparently not. That one sucks.

513
01:40:15,779 --> 01:40:26,979
I want holly and phoenix feather. 11 inches. Nice and supple. Yeah. Okay, I might like this one.

514
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:36,439
Let's try this one. There goes two hundred years of history. We'll find the perfect match here

515
01:40:36,439 --> 01:40:45,000
somewhere. Elm and unicorn hair. 10 inches. Quite whippy. Try it.

516
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:51,239
I want to pick my wand. I don't want him to tell me which one is mine. Doesn't the wand pick the person?

517
01:40:53,159 --> 01:40:59,560
Tricky customer. The wand picks the person. Not the other way around. Try this one. You and

518
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:15,020
unicorn hair. Eight and three quarter inches. Powerful wand. Very powerful. This one has a good feel.

519
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:24,869
Oh bravo. Well, well, well. Curious indeed how these things happen.

520
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:33,350
The wand chooses the wizard. See, that's what I said. I think we must expect great things from you.

521
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:38,970
I think that's what I said. I've already seen the movie. The moment first years arrive at Hogwarts,

522
01:41:38,970 --> 01:41:45,850
they are sorted into one of four houses. I'd better get Slytherin. Slytherin, Hufflepuff

523
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:50,489
or Ravenclaw. I'm gonna be sitting there. I'm gonna be fucking just going Slytherin, Slytherin,

524
01:41:50,489 --> 01:41:57,939
Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin. And the hat's going to be like, Slytherin.

525
01:41:57,939 --> 01:42:02,100
Get sorted or try to influence the hat's decision. See, if you have a strong reference,

526
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:20,020
say Gryffindor, Slytherin or Ravenclaw to try. Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin,

527
01:42:20,979 --> 01:42:26,020
Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, now let me think,

528
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:35,140
Slytherin Slytherin plenty of ambition in this one cunning and resourceful

Want to do like the this thing

764
02:37:17,459 --> 02:37:28,930
Harry learns that Ginny Weasley has been taken to the chamber of secrets by the air of Slytherin and

765
02:37:29,049 --> 02:37:32,450
Finds a way to reach the chamber through the pipes of the castle

766
02:37:32,450 --> 02:37:39,370
He arrives to find Tom Riddle a young Lord Voldemort who has appeared from a 50 year old diary

767
02:37:40,049 --> 02:37:42,049
Standing over a weakened Ginny

768
02:37:42,610 --> 02:37:47,649

Dodge

770
02:37:56,229 --> 02:37:59,829
Dodging the basilisks of the last second will cause him to stun himself momentarily

771
02:38:00,149 --> 02:38:04,270
Once he is stunned spike him with your one hand to damage make a sword this one

772
02:38:05,469 --> 02:38:07,920
She's still alive

773

But only just you see as poor Ginny grows weaker. I grow stronger

774
02:38:19,290 --> 02:38:24,790
Only a base

775
02:38:34,780 --> 02:38:37,270

782
02:40:53,870 --> 02:40:57,139

02:40:58,659 --> 02:41:01,299
You see as poor Ginny grows weaker I

784
02:41:01,940 --> 02:41:03,940
Grow stronger

785
02:42:55,780 --> 02:42:57,780
Myself inside

Professor Lupin and Sirius black and animagus who had taken the form of the black dog

814
02:51:09,620 --> 02:51:11,620

837
02:54:58,729 --> 02:55:03,129
I'm looking at a 27 inch screen from across the whole room. I

838
02:55:08,229 --> 02:55:16,799
Don't have like a big projector. I've waited a long time for this moment

839
02:55:17,719 --> 02:55:19,719
12 years in

840
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:25,719

I think we say I have to stop

844
02:56:33,290 --> 02:56:44,579
Everybody close your eyes till it's done. I'll tell you

He's not getting away this time open your eyes somewhere Pettigrew

846
02:57:07,370 --> 02:57:15,180
That one was impossible

847
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:26,959
Without the secret technique. You're don't do by that hand. I'm going like this hold the wand

848
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,540
Don't like that. It's not whatever. It's like

849
02:57:31,219 --> 02:57:33,520
That's not a big deal

850
02:57:33,559 --> 02:57:39,350
The battle of the Dementors are a man. We go

851
02:57:43,770 --> 02:57:48,049
After capturing Peter Pettigrew the group leave the shrieking shack

852
02:57:48,450 --> 02:57:54,370
But professor Lupin has forgotten to take his wolfsbane potion and turns into a werewolf

853
02:57:55,329 --> 02:57:57,329
Indian suing mayhem

854
02:57:57,889 --> 02:58:00,049
transforms back into a rat and escapes

855
02:58:00,850 --> 02:58:02,950
Serious chases looping kill the diventers

856
02:58:04,370 --> 02:58:11,120
Okay, move your wand and to control your Patronus move it in front of incoming Dementors to repel them

857
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:19,299
All right, lean left and right to block the Dementors path

858
02:58:30,309 --> 02:58:50,200
Walk with the blonde walk with my body body block and arm block. Oh shit

02:59:36,299 --> 02:59:39,180
Take my life essence. All right, just just block

862

863
03:00:02,809 --> 03:00:24,549
It's like house of the dead. They make it so you can't get the two or three people come to the screen at the same time

864
03:00:24,549 --> 03:00:26,389

868
03:03:21,600 --> 03:04:08,250
unnecessary damage

869
03:04:08,250 --> 03:04:10,329
All right. This one this one was really hard last time

870
03:04:15,719 --> 03:04:41,209
Let's go

871
03:04:41,209 --> 03:04:50,729
plenty practice

872
03:04:51,370 --> 03:05:55,659
We go on in the harry potter game, I was here I was I was here

873
03:05:57,690 --> 03:06:00,969
Two I got the achievement of about two

874
03:06:02,090 --> 03:06:04,090
Oh, it's a perfect score. That's why

875
03:06:10,860 --> 03:06:15,530
That was year three

876
03:06:15,530 --> 03:06:19,399
That was it that movie sucked what a boring fucking movie

877
03:06:23,739 --> 03:06:30,139
Dumbledore's suggestion harry and hominy he used the time turner to go back and save buck beak

878
03:06:30,700 --> 03:06:38,540
And learn that it was actually harry who defeated the Dementors and saved sirius not harry's father as he'd thought

879
03:06:40,440 --> 03:06:44,569
Year four is the tribe was a tournament. This is when I get to do this thing

880
03:06:46,069 --> 03:06:48,069
That's all I care about that we can move on

881
03:06:48,469 --> 03:06:53,780
To the relaxing game

882
03:06:53,780 --> 03:06:58,020
When harry is mysteriously entered into the tri wizard tournament

883
03:06:58,420 --> 03:07:04,180
He must first obtain a golden egg from the crunches of a hungarian horn tail dragon

884
03:07:04,579 --> 03:07:08,420
From the egg he learns the second task will be in the lake

885
03:07:08,979 --> 03:07:12,180
You breathe underwater recover something that has been left swim

886
03:07:12,979 --> 03:07:14,620
Okay

887
03:07:14,620 --> 03:07:21,450
So you swim half spells at the window lows with a quick swish of your one hand

888
03:07:22,409 --> 03:07:28,040
And dodge the window the window lows by sidestepping. All right, so swim slash sidestep

889
03:08:17,899 --> 03:08:19,899
Uh, this movie's not very good

890
03:08:21,780 --> 03:08:23,219
What do I do?

891
03:08:23,219 --> 03:08:52,340
That's close

892
03:08:52,340 --> 03:08:54,819
Give me the thing. I want to do this like three times. Come on quick

893
03:09:04,540 --> 03:09:06,540
Of course, I gotta do this like three times

894
03:09:06,540 --> 03:09:08,540
Okay

895
03:09:46,059 --> 03:09:57,450
They're getting they're getting more aggressive how far I can do one two three go all the way

896
03:10:01,690 --> 03:10:22,309
Good, why do they keep playing the avengers theme song?

897
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:26,920
Avengers assemble anything else stellar swimmer one time. Let's go

898
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:30,520
Third task and then we have to fight

899
03:11:31,319 --> 03:11:38,139
What's his name for the third task of the tri wizard tournament harry must avoid obstacles as he races through a maze

900
03:11:39,899 --> 03:11:44,379
And the other tri wizard champions in an effort to be the first to read

901
03:11:44,940 --> 03:11:49,739
I'm not i'm very bad at mazes jump to dodge the maze's low obstacles and duck and shit

902
03:11:50,379 --> 03:11:52,379
duck jump

903
03:11:53,190 --> 03:11:56,950
So it's gonna be terrible. I don't want to do anymore like jumping

904
03:11:58,149 --> 03:12:07,590
I've been jumping for three hours four hours

905
03:12:15,979 --> 03:12:17,819
I can't see them

906
03:12:17,819 --> 03:12:19,819
I can't see

907
03:12:20,059 --> 03:12:47,190
What are you supposed to do that?

908
03:12:47,350 --> 03:12:49,430
How are you supposed to do that? That was impossible

909
03:12:50,149 --> 03:13:04,379
I just need to get to the thing and then we can go to the relaxing game

910
03:13:12,729 --> 03:13:24,180
I'm trying to cheat it

911
03:13:25,219 --> 03:13:47,750
All right last probably phase here phase three

912
03:13:48,549 --> 03:14:01,219
Hey look, there's a dickhead

03:14:01,459 --> 03:14:29,559
All right, that's it. That's it. Come on. That's it

914
03:14:30,360 --> 03:14:34,010
I don't want to do this again. Just concentrate

915
03:14:34,409 --> 03:15:07,420

Die you had your chance

919

Unbeknownst to harry and cedric the tri wizard cub is a portkey that takes them to a graveyard where they encounter peter

920
03:16:23,059 --> 03:16:25,299
During the one connection raise and lower your hand

921
03:16:26,260 --> 03:16:28,440
To move your cast up and down

922
03:16:28,600 --> 03:16:30,920
Trying to match the height of voldemort's cast

923
03:16:31,719 --> 03:16:34,040
This is the thing. This is this thing this thing

924
03:16:34,840 --> 03:16:42,899

I'll tell you what hokomania is the game now and i'm just going to keep on playing hulk hogan

1379
04:18:21,870 --> 04:18:25,309
I could have done a little bit. I could have tried a little harder for hulk hogan there, but no

1380
04:18:26,270 --> 04:18:31,450
Okay, dude, you ready? It's all good, man

1381
04:18:34,879 --> 04:18:37,120
Seriously, bro, you gotta bring your a game now

1382
04:18:37,840 --> 04:18:39,840
You know that contest hulk hogan's running

1383
04:18:40,639 --> 04:18:41,840
What about it?

1384
04:18:41,840 --> 04:18:44,829
The winner gets a wrestling contract

1385
04:18:45,719 --> 04:18:50,430
I shot the big time with the hulkster himself in your corner

1386
04:18:51,680 --> 04:18:55,219
Sweet, let's do this. He's about to punch me in the face. He's taking on the competition

1387
04:18:58,920 --> 04:19:00,920
backyard

1388
04:19:01,540 --> 04:19:06,040
360 pounds and ready for his first match he is

1389
04:19:11,790 --> 04:19:13,790
Is that that's my name

1390
04:19:13,790 --> 04:19:20,670
It's time to show off some signature moves perform the pose indicated by the icon the fast you fall off the low points

1391
04:19:20,670 --> 04:19:22,670
This is like a dance game

1392
04:19:29,530 --> 04:19:50,840
What I didn't do anything i'm gonna if this is a dance game i'm gonna laugh so hard

1393
04:19:53,399 --> 04:20:00,350
Dude, it's just doing it for me now. Why what's going on?

1394
04:20:01,389 --> 04:20:03,389
Your local favorite

1395
04:20:04,430 --> 04:20:08,590
That's me that's me cooking the burger that's that's me

1396
04:20:10,110 --> 04:20:12,110
Why can't I jump in as me?

1397
04:20:26,510 --> 04:20:39,770
Talking two wrestlers trade serious hits for the enjoyment of the bloodthirsty crowd block or dodge your opponent's strikes then unleash your own attacks

1398
04:20:40,489 --> 04:20:42,010
Okay

1399
04:20:42,010 --> 04:20:47,690
Use your hands to block or lean to evade your opponent's punches and headbutts dodge to dodge a kick jump

1400
04:20:50,159 --> 04:20:55,680
After a solid block counter-attack use your head either arm or your legs to attack your opponent

1401
04:20:56,959 --> 04:21:03,659
Can use my head

1402
04:21:07,899 --> 04:21:12,110
Oh

1403
04:21:44,319 --> 04:21:52,319
This game just sucks

1404
04:21:53,440 --> 04:21:57,530
Folks cuz it's time for her to sing

1405
04:21:58,170 --> 04:22:10,350
at the back of the box

1406
04:22:10,350 --> 04:22:15,149
There's chairs. Hold on. I gotta wait for the chairs your opponent is stunned time to show off your slamming skills

1407
04:22:15,469 --> 04:22:19,950
Thrust both arms out to grab next raise both arms to lift your helpless victim over your head

1408
04:22:22,329 --> 04:22:25,610
Once you've opponent over your head perform the indicated slam move

1409
04:22:26,409 --> 04:22:40,489
That was a lame throw

1410
04:22:40,809 --> 04:22:43,239
Get him grab him

1411
04:23:13,610 --> 04:23:17,950
He grabs opponents

1412
04:23:31,069 --> 04:23:36,930
This game is fucking awful. I would rather walk here on disneyland get autographed

1413
04:23:38,190 --> 04:23:42,670
His opponent is slammed to the mat

1414
04:23:43,309 --> 04:23:51,610
He's a feet of strength

1415
04:23:51,850 --> 04:23:54,190
Do it go back to disney get autographed

1416
04:23:55,129 --> 04:23:59,049
No, i'm giving it a chance. I gotta get the chair first and then he's firing up

1417
04:23:59,770 --> 04:24:03,450
Look every game has to take the 30 minutes. You know, that's the rule. That is a very strict rule

1418
04:24:05,120 --> 04:24:07,120
I don't make that rule

1419
04:24:13,200 --> 04:24:30,520
I don't make that rule hong kong in the corner with the chair. I thought I had to win

1420
04:24:31,079 --> 04:24:33,079
All the way before hong kong cared about me

1421
04:24:34,680 --> 04:24:41,229
First soften your opponent up a bit use your arms and legs to elbow leg drop club or sit on him

1422
04:24:42,670 --> 04:24:50,649
Reach out with both arms to get a grip then lean left or lean right to subdue

1423
04:24:54,520 --> 04:25:20,110
It's just qte's it's just quick time events the game it does

1424
04:25:41,290 --> 04:25:49,500
Cover him up will he break free? Oh, he's gonna knock me out. He's gonna keep me in the head like five times

1425
04:26:13,440 --> 04:26:15,440
I'm putting this disc

1426
04:26:33,500 --> 04:26:35,500
Somehow this way lean this way

1427
04:26:55,680 --> 04:26:57,680
Hogan what do you mean by this?

1428
04:26:59,040 --> 04:27:01,040
I understand how this is happening wrong

1429
04:27:10,430 --> 04:27:12,430
It's been three seconds

1430
04:27:12,989 --> 04:27:14,989
Is this a 10 count?

1431
04:27:19,559 --> 04:27:23,159
Uh, it's the match i've won the match it's been like 12 seconds

1432
04:27:26,030 --> 04:27:35,120
really

1433
04:27:35,760 --> 04:27:40,479
Dude that was epic. Thanks, man. You think we can win?

1434
04:27:41,530 --> 04:27:44,329
Yeah, we can win son. Think positive. That was epic

1435
04:27:44,969 --> 04:27:53,290
I'll take the same damn photos. Don't think

1436
04:27:54,809 --> 04:28:10,319
It's been 30 minutes it hasn't it's been like 12

1437
04:28:11,280 --> 04:28:21,440
360 pounds and ready for the paid

1438
04:28:37,159 --> 04:28:39,159
I'm sorry. No one more chance

1439
04:29:00,489 --> 04:29:11,639
That was not a look at me thread the game on screen thread the game on screen

1440
04:29:13,799 --> 04:29:15,799
I definitely like my shredder up here

1441
04:29:17,719 --> 04:29:19,719
I think you can

1442
04:29:21,639 --> 04:29:23,639
Shred the disc on screen

1443
04:29:25,979 --> 04:29:27,979
All right, let's go. Let me just beat him quick

1444
04:29:28,219 --> 04:29:30,219
No tutorials. No, nothing. Let's go

1445
04:29:33,790 --> 04:29:35,790
Dialogue is broken. Anyways, here we go

1446
04:30:13,180 --> 04:30:15,500
I can't take that one anymore. That game was terrible

1447
04:30:18,010 --> 04:30:22,670
I ain't doing that one shred it shred it shred shred shred shred

1448
04:30:25,469 --> 04:30:29,399
I can't

1449
04:30:29,399 --> 04:30:37,040
I can't

1450
04:30:37,040 --> 04:30:40,319
I don't know if I can shred it. What if I can't spread it? What if it's not allowed in my shredder?

1451
04:30:53,790 --> 04:31:00,329
Oh fuck I have to play this uh, which one of these do I want to play this is this is where it gets hard

1452
04:31:02,270 --> 04:31:03,229
All right

1453
04:31:03,229 --> 04:31:05,229
I think it's time to bust it out

1454
04:31:08,219 --> 04:31:09,959
I think so

1455
04:31:09,959 --> 04:31:28,670
Time to play wipe out

1456
04:31:28,670 --> 04:31:30,670
Shred this one, too

1457
04:31:31,840 --> 04:31:34,479
I'm just gonna shred like six games at the end of this frame

1458
04:31:35,950 --> 04:31:38,350
By the way, it's still got two fucking full horror games

1459
04:31:39,149 --> 04:31:42,200
You might be seeing those tomorrow

1460
04:31:42,200 --> 04:31:49,389
depends

1461
04:31:49,389 --> 04:31:54,639
Wipe out god that whole koken game was just awful

1462
04:31:55,360 --> 04:31:59,520
There's no redeeming qualities at all. The harry potter game was actually pretty

1463
04:32:00,319 --> 04:32:01,959
Pretty legit

1464
04:32:01,959 --> 04:32:05,559
I'm gonna say harry potter anytime anywhere abc

1465
04:32:08,299 --> 04:32:10,299
All right, this is an abc show

1466
04:32:10,959 --> 04:32:12,559
harry potter

1467
04:32:12,559 --> 04:32:13,760
and

1468
04:32:13,760 --> 04:32:18,559
When I got scanned that first time in jillian michael

1469
04:32:24,780 --> 04:32:27,200
and

1470
04:32:27,200 --> 04:32:31,850
What what if we can play? Oh when I threw for a touch down

1471
04:32:35,049 --> 04:32:38,639
Oh

1472
04:32:44,459 --> 04:32:51,159
Oh

1473
04:32:51,159 --> 04:32:53,719
I could win this

1474
04:32:55,719 --> 04:32:57,959
I could beat this I would destroy this course

1475
04:32:58,840 --> 04:33:01,159
There's no way I would ever accept falling down

1476
04:33:02,459 --> 04:33:08,939
If I got on to wipe out I would I would not fall down one time. That is a 100 guarantee

1477
04:33:12,110 --> 04:33:15,150
Hold your hands over the button to begin the game. There we go wipe out in the zone

1478
04:33:19,840 --> 04:33:21,040
Who is it?

1479
04:33:21,040 --> 04:33:22,880
Is it tended ragun?

1480
04:33:22,880 --> 04:33:28,299
It's me. You don't know me

1481
04:33:28,299 --> 04:33:30,750
It's me

1482
04:33:30,830 --> 04:33:32,029
It's me

1483
04:33:32,029 --> 04:33:42,729
It's me

1484
04:33:42,729 --> 04:33:51,840
So it is david

1485
04:33:51,840 --> 04:33:53,840
david's the uh the console

1486
04:33:54,959 --> 04:33:58,669
I don't know who the fuck that is

1487
04:33:58,669 --> 04:34:01,500
Who are these people?

1488
04:34:01,500 --> 04:34:03,500
No, we're gonna use my avatar

1489
04:34:04,830 --> 04:34:08,250
my avatar

1490
04:34:08,250 --> 04:34:09,790
hard

1491
04:34:09,790 --> 04:34:15,049
I'm not fucking around

1492
04:34:15,049 --> 04:34:17,610
Oh, I I can't I have to actually go in order

1493
04:34:18,330 --> 04:34:36,639
This would be a good warm-up. All right, i'm feeling it

1494
04:34:41,130 --> 04:34:44,250
Why don't you just say something doesn't seem to be about jim henson. What does that do wipe out?

1495
04:34:50,159 --> 04:34:52,159
Baby mode. I tried to do hard

1496
04:34:52,479 --> 04:34:54,779
You saw that I tried

1497
04:34:54,779 --> 04:35:07,419
All right to wipe out it's a little game full of highs

1498
04:35:07,419 --> 04:35:14,139
Let's just hope the highs are really high and the lows. It's just more fun for all of us that way

1499
04:35:14,220 --> 04:35:18,299
All right, let's see what the qualifiers looking like for arkansas. This is an easy one

1500
04:35:18,299 --> 04:35:24,299
It should be a walk in the park for him johnny. This is the doorknob everybody's favorite giant hammer behind every door

1501
04:35:25,639 --> 04:35:28,840
You have to run past it and then the wall provides the pocket

1502
04:35:30,360 --> 04:35:32,360
Playing on like spider-man the big balls

1503
04:35:33,000 --> 04:35:39,229
The bouncy ball along with their loving friend this is first person game or is this like a sidescroller?

1504
04:35:39,549 --> 04:35:43,229
It's a muddy muddy playground. How do I traverse this?

1505
04:35:46,270 --> 04:35:48,270
We're here with oh

1506
04:35:51,150 --> 04:35:54,909

We're going already

1509
04:36:12,750 --> 04:36:13,869
Shit

1510
04:36:13,869 --> 04:36:15,869
I didn't know we were going that fast

1511
04:36:18,759 --> 04:36:20,759
Or I get it I get I know I got hit

1512

All right, i'm good

04:37:50,490 --> 04:37:52,490
It's really really fucked up

1516
04:37:52,970 --> 04:37:54,970
No

1517
04:38:01,659 --> 04:38:05,819
Of course they played that one without the one where I bounced around like a dickhead from five times

1518
04:38:17,599 --> 04:38:32,889
Damn it. I don't understand

1519
04:39:03,580 --> 04:39:08,409
Dark in here, huh?

1520
04:39:08,409 --> 04:39:12,090
So far in the round. This is how things stand. I'm doing fine. I'm winning

1526
04:39:52,880 --> 04:40:02,590
You know the sweeper arm really is one of my screws on kids who didn't even try

1527
04:40:03,389 --> 04:40:21,310
I don't even get a chance to continue

1528
04:40:21,630 --> 04:40:37,869
shit

1529
04:40:38,909 --> 04:40:43,000
The wipeout zone, I don't know. I remember I don't remember this thing

1530
04:40:43,720 --> 04:40:49,639
About zone. I like it so much. Oh, I do know what this is. I like what I see before I even see it

1531
04:40:50,040 --> 04:40:57,759
Uh blades of fury. I'm a big fan. Welcome to the super mario 64 first bowser level

1532
04:40:58,639 --> 04:41:06,479
This is the screwdriver stay on the rotating log or this is the crank shaft all those

Let's see if we can get all fucking eight red coins it says snapshot. Oh, you don't understand here we go

04:44:00,509 --> 04:44:11,919
I win. I win. I won it. I did it. It's like final jeopardy. I got all the points at the end

1540
04:44:12,639 --> 04:44:26,279

I need like a fucking personal ac unit

1557
04:50:41,630 --> 04:50:43,630
But in his defense

1558
04:50:55,900 --> 04:51:02,270

This is the one we just had to jump

1562
04:51:13,919 --> 04:51:15,919
You just have to jump

1563
04:51:16,000 --> 04:51:17,580
That's it

1564
04:51:17,580 --> 04:51:27,439
Nothing else

What what do I have to do?

1569
04:52:16,439 --> 04:52:21,240
It's too much to do that it's too much to jump in the fucking place in your room no

1570
04:52:22,200 --> 04:52:26,299
I'm gonna have to like you drink a bread bowl

1571
04:52:42,880 --> 04:53:02,110
This one is most intense of the whole night this is more intense than the first exercise one

1572
04:53:02,909 --> 04:53:07,599
I gotta find a way

1573
04:53:07,599 --> 04:53:09,759
To like make it so I like going to jump

1574
04:53:10,799 --> 04:53:13,229
Can I get like a pair of shoes and just hold me like this?

1575
04:53:13,869 --> 04:53:15,869
Do I have any shoes up here?

1576

04:53:18,400 --> 04:54:03,450
Stay right hold on

1578
04:54:06,330 --> 04:54:08,330
For being trapped in a video game

1579
04:54:12,029 --> 04:54:19,130
It works

1580
04:54:29,470 --> 04:54:31,470
That's fucked up the thing's tilted

1581
04:54:43,130 --> 04:55:02,900

I'm gonna press the button it's time to put in a different one

1583
04:56:15,099 --> 04:56:36,520
This one's got much better traction. I've heard i'm of course talking

1584
04:56:42,159 --> 04:56:45,520
Anytime anywhere abc about wipeout free

1585
04:56:46,080 --> 04:56:57,840
Not wipeout in the zone

1586
04:56:57,840 --> 04:57:02,720
Is this the same game?

1587
04:57:02,720 --> 04:57:04,720
Just packaged differently

1588
04:57:04,799 --> 04:57:08,889
It's not right

1589
04:57:11,209 --> 04:57:12,990

Looks like they're off to a good start, but it's abc so make sense. Oh, that was a close one

1596
04:57:41,580 --> 04:57:43,659
They say she's never like a pop patrol animator

1597
04:57:46,750 --> 04:57:48,750
It might actually be

1598
04:57:53,150 --> 04:58:03,450
Hey, here's where it all went all right, what's this a cuter and possibly sweeter side of wipeout?

Accessorizing with a brand new ramp

1641
05:03:14,479 --> 05:03:20,490
It's for you in the stomach johnny this player is a real belly glutton for punishment

1642
05:03:23,610 --> 05:03:27,610
Harry Potter was all the expelliarmus and the book of the medicus and sugar. Why not just do that?

1652
05:04:24,599 --> 05:04:27,630
Pick a robot. Oh, no, that's who's moving on

1653
05:04:32,939 --> 05:04:37,799
What what's going on? What?

1654
05:04:37,880 --> 05:04:43,799
Why does everybody say that? Why is that? Why was that not funny? I didn't do anything. It might look tacky as a lawn decoration

1655
05:04:44,040 --> 05:04:46,040
But his route jump up to start

1656
05:04:47,709 --> 05:04:49,709
All right, here we go

05:04:50,270 --> 05:04:52,909
I'm gonna try to get this first try ready. Check this out

1658
05:04:53,790 --> 05:05:03,259
What does this mean?

1659
05:05:03,259 --> 05:05:06,909
What is this trying to tell me to do?

1660
05:05:13,680 --> 05:05:16,479
Am I taking a fucking left on a bike? I don't get it. I don't understand

1661
05:05:18,000 --> 05:05:25,159
Projectile

1662
05:05:25,159 --> 05:05:29,930
Clean up aisle two fifth ring is in our player's hand

1663
05:05:31,450 --> 05:05:33,450
technical foul

1664
05:05:34,729 --> 05:05:36,729
And off goes our contestant johnny

1665
05:05:38,409 --> 05:05:45,069
That is some angry aerosol

1666
05:05:50,919 --> 05:05:52,919
I'm right here

1667
05:05:53,880 --> 05:05:57,080
That was I had to qualify look at these fucking outfits

1668
05:05:58,520 --> 05:06:01,799
Holy shit, you can see back here. They're doing me proud johnny

1669
05:06:07,659 --> 05:06:11,020
Let's check out somebody game show after round two object the balls

1670
05:06:11,580 --> 05:06:14,939
By the way, one of these game show games was insanely expensive

1671
05:06:19,560 --> 05:06:21,560
How why why would a robot be allowed to do this?

1672
05:06:22,279 --> 05:06:23,639
Seems unfair

1673
05:06:23,639 --> 05:06:27,529
Do you ever look at the bottom left?

1674
05:06:27,610 --> 05:06:33,689
Round three you haven't been bumped and pushed this much since black 10 bucks. No, it was 50 over here john

1675
05:06:33,849 --> 05:06:40,330
Actually may have been 60 reindeer games. These are not you know what they say. It is this easy. I don't like this one

1676
05:06:41,290 --> 05:06:47,209
This one feels like an ipad game and our contestant feels like those runners wipe out runner

1677
05:06:48,090 --> 05:06:51,159
Up and get sprayed from head to toe

1678
05:06:52,040 --> 05:06:58,189
I thought this I don't feel like there's any danger here one two second ring for you

1679
05:06:59,150 --> 05:07:15,720
And the fifth ring is in our player's hand. He's looking sharp with a shiny new ring

1680
05:07:17,000 --> 05:07:23,340
first try

1681
05:07:25,150 --> 05:07:29,150
Somebody just made a strong case to be number one in the wipeout draft

1682
05:07:30,029 --> 05:07:35,389
Perfection that's how you do it playa. You just got your first dollars. Nice

1683
05:07:36,990 --> 05:07:38,990
When there is a clown nose

1684
05:07:39,470 --> 05:07:43,180
I don't know. What's the what's the wipeout clown nose for?

1685
05:07:44,619 --> 05:07:52,909
Our course really put the deck in round three of deck the balls and this is generic rock

1686
05:07:54,110 --> 05:07:56,110
It's the way the two announcers

1687
05:07:57,069 --> 05:07:58,590
are playing

1688
05:07:58,590 --> 05:08:00,590
And they made it all the way to the finals

1689
05:08:00,590 --> 05:08:04,700
It seems a little weird that the both the announcers

1690
05:08:08,430 --> 05:08:11,020
All right

1691
05:08:11,020 --> 05:08:16,939
Coming up next. It's our festive wipeout zone. I can't wait to see our contestants fair on this holiday course partner

1692
05:08:17,020 --> 05:08:20,060
It'll stuff their stockings johnny jump up player

1693
05:08:21,099 --> 05:08:30,830
I'm right. I haven't moved at all

1694
05:08:34,919 --> 05:08:36,919
What oh that didn't lose

1695
05:08:37,000 --> 05:09:05,080
I think it's supposed to be parts of

1696
05:09:05,720 --> 05:09:06,919
Slow down

1697
05:09:06,919 --> 05:09:08,919
technical foul

1698
05:09:09,080 --> 05:09:29,549
Oh our player gets punched don't do that on an empty stomach

1699
05:09:30,110 --> 05:09:34,380
And the fifth ring is in our player's hand

1700
05:09:39,069 --> 05:09:41,439
Oh shit, oh

1701
05:09:41,759 --> 05:09:43,759
All right. Whatever. Is that all you got?

1702
05:09:51,659 --> 05:09:53,819
This is a checkpoint and keeps their eye on the prize

1703
05:09:54,779 --> 05:09:57,150
kids be done

1704
05:10:01,630 --> 05:10:10,909
It's time for final jeopardy congratulations you finished the merry wipeout zone

1705
05:10:11,709 --> 05:10:18,349
Oh, I won

1706
05:10:18,349 --> 05:10:20,349
Give me that check

1707
05:10:20,669 --> 05:10:42,349
It's not working. I'm not gonna do it. I want to floss so bad, but i'll turn the camera off to do it

1708
05:10:43,389 --> 05:10:49,790
Well, that does it for myself john anderson and vanessa lachey. All right, this one sucks saying good night and big balls

1709
05:10:50,110 --> 05:10:52,110

You didn't you didn't hear anything

2247
06:03:46,900 --> 06:03:49,779
You would have heard like a dung if I had dropped it

2248
06:03:51,060 --> 06:03:53,220
There's nothing to drop. I don't have anything to drop

2249
06:03:54,110 --> 06:04:00,029
There's nothing to drop that would be the blue ridges of north carolina. Is that your final answer?

2250
06:04:10,540 --> 06:04:16,299
Yes

2251
06:04:29,759 --> 06:04:31,759

06:05:00,080 --> 06:05:02,080
It's not make room

2257
06:05:03,099 --> 06:05:04,380
For that one

2258
06:05:04,380 --> 06:05:07,139
It's not rick and morty either

2259
06:05:07,459 --> 06:05:12,130
What are you talking about? Um

2260
06:05:24,750 --> 06:05:28,270
I don't know. I have no idea. It's probably it's probably father knows best

2261
06:05:30,419 --> 06:05:33,860
Father knows best. Is that your final answer?

2262
06:05:34,659 --> 06:05:36,900
Yes, I don't whatever if I lose I lose who cares

2263
06:05:40,740 --> 06:05:42,740
I was about to press the button on the xbox

2264
06:05:42,900 --> 06:05:55,279
The games left to play I thought that was 500 000. I feel so unfulfilled

2265
06:05:59,169 --> 06:06:01,119

2271
06:06:40,139 --> 06:06:42,619

2272
06:06:42,700 --> 06:06:43,900

2275
06:06:56,590 --> 06:07:01,869
You won't win any money for the question 9 pm bedtime. Here's the first question

2276
06:07:03,250 --> 06:07:11,009
Better get star wars tomorrow. Oh, I don't know. Do you think he don't have it located in what u.s state?

florida new jersey

2279
06:07:17,599 --> 06:07:35,200
Why would I do that? That's the one everybody wants to see the most

2280
06:07:46,369 --> 06:07:47,889
Shred hogan

2281
06:07:47,889 --> 06:07:51,009
I I don't think hold on. Let me let me see if I can shred hogan

2282
06:07:51,889 --> 06:07:54,689
But no, why would I do that? Somebody could like play it and enjoy it

2283
06:07:58,240 --> 06:08:03,759
So I get if I like donate that game or something somebody might like play it. I don't know. I don't want to like

2284
06:08:05,200 --> 06:08:07,200
I don't want to shred a game

2285
06:08:07,520 --> 06:08:10,880

Antiques

2287
06:08:20,669 --> 06:08:26,110

I had one coca cola and like three glasses of water

2303
06:09:40,159 --> 06:09:42,479
Uh, so we're gonna start tomorrow probably around one or two pm

2304
06:09:43,200 --> 06:09:46,720
And then i've got tomorrow is the real kind of meat and potatoes

2305
06:09:47,439 --> 06:09:49,919
We've got star wars. We got those two horror games

2307
06:09:55,360 --> 06:09:56,639
I would

2308
06:09:56,639 --> 06:09:58,319
I would

2309
06:09:58,319 --> 06:09:59,680
If you have time

2310
06:09:59,680 --> 06:10:06,740
It's all i'm missing

2311
06:10:06,740 --> 06:10:08,740
And there's like 15 other games after that

2312
06:10:09,060 --> 06:10:12,099
So I really don't know if i'm gonna get through all of them, but we'll oh and

2313
06:10:12,500 --> 06:10:14,979
But here's here's the uh, let's get on cam. Lisa

2314
06:10:15,779 --> 06:10:17,779
Uh, so here's what's gonna happen for this week

2315
06:10:17,860 --> 06:10:19,299
tomorrow, we're gonna do

2316
06:10:19,299 --> 06:10:21,220
more connect

2317
06:10:21,220 --> 06:10:22,419
and then

2318
06:10:22,419 --> 06:10:27,860
I believe on tuesday or when would tuesday that ancestors game comes out

2319
06:10:28,580 --> 06:10:30,580
I'm gonna play the hell out of that

2320
06:10:31,680 --> 06:10:37,060
tuesday ancestors comes out and then saturday or some whatever the is terrarium

2321
06:10:38,159 --> 06:10:40,560
It's the money's game. We play the monkey the apes

2322
06:10:42,240 --> 06:10:46,959
And you have to like level up it and and survive. It's a rogue like

2323
06:10:47,900 --> 06:10:49,900
Ancestors eight game

2324
06:10:52,349 --> 06:10:54,349
It seems like it's gonna be a lot fun

2325
06:10:54,669 --> 06:10:57,299
But i'm willing to put at least one or two streams into it

2326
06:10:58,880 --> 06:11:03,419
All right, let's get off cam. I don't like it

2327
06:11:03,979 --> 06:11:09,700
It's day's gone part two. I don't know. It seems it looks way more interesting when day's gone was

2328
06:11:10,580 --> 06:11:16,369
But that's kind of the games that are on tap for this week

2329
06:11:17,009 --> 06:11:19,169
The rest of connect well next week too

2330
06:11:20,270 --> 06:11:22,270
steam page says 2020

2331
06:11:23,220 --> 06:11:25,779
Uh, I thought no it comes that's for a console

2332
06:11:26,580 --> 06:11:32,540
It launches on pc like two or three months before console

2333
06:11:33,259 --> 06:11:34,860
weirdly enough

2334
06:11:34,860 --> 06:11:37,259
That's one of the only games. I think that's done that in a long time

2335
06:11:38,220 --> 06:11:45,520
Why does this have already have a three out of ten?

2336
06:11:49,520 --> 06:11:55,080
What?

2337
06:11:55,080 --> 06:11:56,779
3.6 out of 10

2338
06:11:56,779 --> 06:12:11,409
Oh, it's because it's on the epic store only is it is it only on the epic store?

2339
06:12:12,529 --> 06:12:15,099
Do I actually have to download the epic store for this?

2340
06:12:26,270 --> 06:12:30,110
Well, I still want to play it though. It looks like people say it's not that good

2341
06:12:30,189 --> 06:12:32,270
There's a couple of reviews that say it's not good

2342
06:12:33,310 --> 06:12:35,310
Well, i'm still gonna play it

2343
06:12:38,419 --> 06:12:42,340
Yeah, it goes to ps4 and xbox one. I think next early next year

2344
06:12:43,310 --> 06:12:45,310
Or late this year something like that

2345
06:12:45,869 --> 06:12:49,779
I'm just gonna do it. I'm playing it but uh, i'll see you guys tomorrow

2346

The last i heard of him was when you told that story about him eating the giant muff

2363
06:14:02,139 --> 06:14:04,139
Um, he's still he's still kicking around

2364
06:14:04,540 --> 06:14:07,490
I mean we live

2365
06:14:07,490 --> 06:14:09,650
Across the country from each other at this point. So

2366
06:14:11,200 --> 06:14:12,159
it's

2367
06:14:12,159 --> 06:14:14,819
We talk from time to time sometimes he's

2368
06:14:15,700 --> 06:14:18,419
he has like a family and his own life and

2369
06:14:19,380 --> 06:14:27,139
He just kind of does his thing and i've whenever i'm back around massachusetts

2370
06:14:28,159 --> 06:14:33,459
You know, i'll probably see him

2371
06:14:33,459 --> 06:14:36,259
He's got a video. Yeah, he he did like to make another video

2372
06:14:37,220 --> 06:14:39,540
Of him like eating cupcakes or something. All right

2373
06:14:44,590 --> 06:14:47,310
Yeah, he's still he's still the same fucking weirdo

2374
06:14:47,950 --> 06:14:51,069
So don't worry. Not much has changed at least throughout I guess

2375
06:14:56,990 --> 06:15:01,150
It's him like laughing and like stuffing cupcakes it down his throat and like puking it back up

2376
06:15:01,150 --> 06:15:02,990
It's not you don't want to watch that video. I don't think

2377
06:15:05,970 --> 06:15:07,970
Yeah, he's not he's doing all right. I guess

2378
06:15:08,290 --> 06:15:12,290
We don't talk as much as we used to but you know, it's I talked to him from time to time

2387
06:15:46,509 --> 06:15:50,880
This is ridiculous

2388
06:15:50,959 --> 06:15:52,319
Holy shit

2389
06:15:52,319 --> 06:15:56,990
But thank you for the ten dollars

2390
06:15:56,990 --> 06:15:59,709
And your huge amount of community subs as well, sir k9

2391
06:15:59,709 --> 06:16:04,270
Thanks for the 250 can't believe you died to tree wheel pinwheels shitty your cousin omega lul

2392
06:16:08,779 --> 06:16:11,340
I I liked that game that game was charming

2393
06:16:13,599 --> 06:16:19,840
Uh rare pepe body lotion. Thanks for the 15 dollars. They just say germapop 15 bucks. Thank you rare pepe

2394
06:16:23,580 --> 06:16:30,529
Thanks for dropping 15 bucks. I'm gonna charge my uh bluetooth and my

2395
06:16:31,250 --> 06:16:33,250
Wireless headset. I love this thing

2396
06:16:33,490 --> 06:16:37,889
I am so pissed off that I didn't get something like this before think about how many streams you've seen

2397
06:16:38,689 --> 06:16:40,689
Where I just have that dumb dickhead

2398
06:16:41,889 --> 06:16:43,889
Attached wire to my body

2399
06:16:44,610 --> 06:16:47,330
And I never thought just to get a bluetooth trans transmitter

2400
06:16:48,049 --> 06:16:49,650
What's wrong with me?

2401
06:16:49,650 --> 06:16:53,810
It's been i've been streaming for almost four and a half five years

2402
06:16:55,009 --> 06:16:58,610
And I I just two days ago got a bluetooth transmitter

2403
06:16:59,330 --> 06:17:09,340
What's wrong with me?

2404
06:17:09,340 --> 06:17:11,419
Because emf is bad shut it up. Are you using this?

2405
06:17:11,979 --> 06:17:16,540
Don't scare me

2406
06:17:16,540 --> 06:17:19,259
But thank you rare pepe. Thank you stephunky chicken for the five dollars

2407
06:17:19,259 --> 06:17:21,180
Thanks for all the passion and if we put into your streams

2408
06:17:21,180 --> 06:17:25,819
It really shows if you're tired from connect post stream and feel like screening it

2409
06:17:26,139 --> 06:17:31,419
I spent the last two weeks working on a video about a joke you made three weeks ago las vegas las vegas

2410
06:17:31,979 --> 06:17:34,580
Noir it's funny right when you said that

2411
06:17:35,299 --> 06:17:37,939
Look at this

2412
06:17:37,939 --> 06:17:39,540
Shit, did I get it?

2413
06:17:39,540 --> 06:17:41,779
It just told me to take a break. It said you're you look tired

2414
06:17:42,939 --> 06:17:46,020
It just said it on the bottom of the screen

2415
06:17:46,099 --> 06:17:54,209
As if you wrote it

2416
06:17:54,209 --> 06:17:57,569
Uh, I think I need to talk about a couple other things, too

2417
06:17:58,369 --> 06:18:03,729
There's like a bunch of shit that i'm like falling behind on the activity book stream. I'm gonna have to push forward

2418
06:18:04,610 --> 06:18:07,790
I haven't had time to really want I want to talk about it in length

2419
06:18:08,349 --> 06:18:10,590
So where the that activity book?

2420
06:18:11,069 --> 06:18:13,069
Where's waldo stream?

2421
06:18:13,470 --> 06:18:17,790
Is gonna go forward another few three four or five days probably into like the first week of september

2422
06:18:20,340 --> 06:18:21,939
just because

2423
06:18:21,939 --> 06:18:24,740
I really want to let people know what's happening if they want to contribute to it

2424
06:18:24,740 --> 06:18:26,979
I have just not had a chance at all to sit down and do it

2425
06:18:27,860 --> 06:18:32,819
And phylactery lich just gave another 20 subs adding up to like six or seven

2426
06:18:33,540 --> 06:18:35,540
trillion or whatever they are

2427
06:18:35,540 --> 06:18:37,540
More subs from phylactery lich 20 more

2428
06:18:38,900 --> 06:18:42,419
Your credit card is gonna melt

2429
06:18:42,419 --> 06:18:45,860
That should that happens that should happen in rocko's modern life. So, you know, it's real

2430
06:18:47,860 --> 06:18:50,900
Uh, thank you phylactery for the how many community subs do you have now?

2431
06:18:51,540 --> 06:18:56,259
This reminds me of uh, I remember a while ago. There was somebody that had like two three four five hundred community subs

2432
06:19:00,669 --> 06:19:03,439
Thank you

2433
06:19:03,439 --> 06:19:05,759
You not only have given that many subs. You've also

2434
06:19:06,400 --> 06:19:08,400
You are at a hundred thousand fifths

2435
06:19:09,680 --> 06:19:12,400
And we're talking not lifetime. We're talking for the week

2436
06:19:13,659 --> 06:19:18,139
That's the week

2437
06:19:18,139 --> 06:19:22,849
damn, dude

2438
06:19:22,849 --> 06:19:27,490
Thank you for the ridiculous support. I don't know what else to say. That's a lot of money

2439
06:19:31,040 --> 06:19:33,040
Hopefully you got a large raise. Yeah

2440
06:19:33,680 --> 06:19:38,560
I really hope so

2441
06:19:38,560 --> 06:19:40,639
But thank you

2442
06:19:40,639 --> 06:19:42,580
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

2443
06:19:42,580 --> 06:19:44,400
We also had

2444
06:19:44,400 --> 06:19:48,080
Oh, but anyways, uh to talk about the not just the activity stream i'll go

2445
06:19:48,720 --> 06:19:51,119
But pretty much the first thing we're gonna do

2446
06:19:52,529 --> 06:19:59,810
Not tomorrow because obviously i'm gonna be jumping around like an idiot on connect but on the ancestor stream that tuesday

2447
06:20:00,450 --> 06:20:05,569
we're gonna sit down and i'm gonna talk about the activity book and i'm also gonna try to talk about a

2448
06:20:06,529 --> 06:20:08,930
Monthly community night where all videos

2449
06:20:09,810 --> 06:20:12,450
And all artwork and we're gonna go over that kind of stuff

2450
06:20:13,250 --> 06:20:17,020
Once a month and just have like a whole viewing stream

2451
06:20:17,819 --> 06:20:19,580
for a community night

2452
06:20:19,580 --> 06:20:22,979
Where we just relax we just kick back put on some music

2453
06:20:23,779 --> 06:20:26,270
or whatever

2454
06:20:26,270 --> 06:20:28,189
And just hang out for a few hours

2455
06:20:28,189 --> 06:20:38,240
I'll be doing that once a month because so many people as the channel has gotten a little larger

2456
06:20:38,720 --> 06:20:44,240
There's a ton of people now with really really good shit really really high quality videos

2457
06:20:45,040 --> 06:20:47,040
original artworks and paintings

2458
06:20:48,590 --> 06:20:51,069
There's a lot of people that it would be great to show

2459
06:20:51,709 --> 06:20:56,700
And I think there's enough content there where we could get at least a few hours of just hanging out and talking

2460
06:20:57,659 --> 06:21:04,029
So it's not just going to be artwork. It'll be video content as well

2461
06:21:04,669 --> 06:21:10,740
There's a lot of people that make really good videos really high caliber high quality videos

2462
06:21:14,930 --> 06:21:20,540
And I want to show them it'll be kind of like it is right now

2463
06:21:21,099 --> 06:21:24,060
The only difference is it won't be a stream over screen

2464
06:21:25,020 --> 06:21:26,779
it will be

2465
06:21:26,779 --> 06:21:31,709
community contributions

2466
06:21:31,709 --> 06:21:38,689
Don't become a react streamer. No, this is once a month. I'm too adhd to like sit and watch videos every day

2467
06:21:38,689 --> 06:21:40,209
I wouldn't be able to do it

2468
06:21:40,209 --> 06:21:44,369
I would get up and fucking start. I would just start moving or i'd have to move. I can't just sit. I can't do that

2469
06:21:49,840 --> 06:21:56,459
Some people can I can't

2470
06:21:56,459 --> 06:22:00,779
But that's what you can expect for if you hey, I got a video or have some artwork

2471
06:22:01,500 --> 06:22:03,259
We're going to start to

2472
06:22:03,259 --> 06:22:04,860
Not show them here

2473
06:22:04,860 --> 06:22:09,259
And compile them and actually have them and i'm going to talk about it on tuesday

2474
06:22:11,099 --> 06:22:13,419
So for until for further notice

2475
06:22:16,380 --> 06:22:20,939
I'm not going to be doing end of stream kind of video artwork stuff. We're going to hold on to them

2476
06:22:22,590 --> 06:22:24,270
There's going to be an official

2477
06:22:24,270 --> 06:22:26,270
Discord channel that we're going to make

2478
06:22:26,270 --> 06:22:30,700
To do that

2479
06:22:30,700 --> 06:22:33,020
I will be in that channel. I'll be able to pull stuff from it

2480
06:22:34,110 --> 06:22:36,909
So it's not just going to be like not like the creative channel

2481
06:22:37,310 --> 06:22:41,470
But a hey, here's like my community contribution that I think would be cool

2482
06:22:41,549 --> 06:22:45,069
And I think I put enough time into it and it looks like it's you know, looks great

2483
06:22:45,150 --> 06:22:47,709
I think i'm really happy with it, you know when you're like happy with it

2484
06:22:48,669 --> 06:22:50,669
And you want it to be shown on stream

2485
06:22:50,830 --> 06:22:52,830
the creative channel, I think is good just to be

2486
06:22:53,069 --> 06:22:57,229
an open forum for people just to kind of talk and post stuff and talk about art and

2487
06:22:58,029 --> 06:22:59,790
creative stuff so

2488
06:23:02,419 --> 06:23:04,419
German just like a backpack

2489
06:23:07,470 --> 06:23:13,340
Backpack was what is my what do you mean my backpack?

2490
06:23:19,889 --> 06:23:21,889
This is a new thing that I don't know

2491
06:23:22,610 --> 06:23:28,849
Why did you guys start spamming this?

2492
06:23:28,849 --> 06:23:31,650

Cheers from across the pond

2502

2510
06:24:50,939 --> 06:24:52,939
Just get good grades

2511
06:24:56,529 --> 06:25:01,970
You know what i'm saying. Thank you to

2512
06:25:05,299 --> 06:25:07,299
apple shift for the five dollars

2513
06:25:09,709 --> 06:25:11,709
Five bucks from apple shift

2514
06:25:12,110 --> 06:25:17,180
Hey, man, it's me gwen. I just finished all the rumbles. So I wanted to do another drawing for you

2515
06:25:17,580 --> 06:25:19,259
That would celebrate them really hope you like it

2516
06:25:19,259 --> 06:25:23,500
I've been working on it for about three weeks and I finally finished. Thank you for inspiring me and being the best boy

2517
06:25:23,580 --> 06:25:28,799
Here's a link to the 4k version of it. We're going to hold on to it. I'm going to hold it

2518
06:25:30,139 --> 06:25:33,740
Because this first community stream is going to happen way sooner than you think

2519
06:25:34,959 --> 06:25:36,959
I'm probably going to do this

2520
06:25:40,669 --> 06:25:43,950
The first one will probably happen before the carnival stream

2521
06:25:47,599 --> 06:25:51,979
tonight

2522
06:25:51,979 --> 06:25:56,299
Because I I really do think that once that channel is open in the next week or so

2523
06:25:57,259 --> 06:26:01,900
A a lot of people are going to start to submit stuff and it will be very very easy to do one

2524
06:26:03,659 --> 06:26:05,900
At some point before that carnival stream happens

2525
06:26:11,779 --> 06:26:17,380
And if not before then very very soon right after it. I can't imagine it would take a whole lot of time to get some great stuff

2526
06:26:18,750 --> 06:26:24,590
But thank you apple shift. Hold on to it join the discord and put it in that discord. We're going to do this once a month

2527
06:26:26,509 --> 06:26:28,509
because the reason one of the reasons why

2528
06:26:30,159 --> 06:26:31,279
is

2529
06:26:31,279 --> 06:26:35,599
Because it's still the end of the stream right when it's a stream over. Okay. Good night everybody. See you later

2530
06:26:36,319 --> 06:26:38,240
most people leave

2531
06:26:38,240 --> 06:26:39,360
right

2532
06:26:39,360 --> 06:26:41,919
And there's a lot of cool shit that I think people would like to see

2533
06:26:42,720 --> 06:26:45,439
That we just put on the screen here that I put on the screen

2534
06:26:46,560 --> 06:26:48,560
when it's just kind of the

2535
06:26:48,799 --> 06:26:51,279
You know like 40 50 percent of all people have left

2536
06:26:53,490 --> 06:26:59,330
And I can imagine a scenario where because think about some of those videos we've watched that were 10 out of 10 hilarious videos

2537
06:27:00,130 --> 06:27:02,130
that people have made and

2538
06:27:02,290 --> 06:27:06,450
Less than half of the full stream broadcast audience got to see it

2539
06:27:07,790 --> 06:27:15,759
If people knew that that stuff was going to be available and that was a a night thing that we did once a month

2540
06:27:16,880 --> 06:27:20,720
I think oh my god. I'm just like just my tongue almost just like was eaten

2541
06:27:22,770 --> 06:27:24,450
It was just aided

2542
06:27:24,450 --> 06:27:26,049
It was like

2543
06:27:26,049 --> 06:27:28,049
Uh, I think more people would stick around

2544
06:27:33,020 --> 06:27:35,020
That was weird. It was like

2545
06:27:40,240 --> 06:27:42,240
I know it's because i'm you know, it's because look

2546
06:27:43,740 --> 06:27:48,299
I'm like kneeling on one knee and like going like like hunching over I gotta like get up

2547
06:27:54,610 --> 06:27:58,930
But uh, thank you apple ship for the five dollars. Hold on to your art. We're gonna do a full night

2548
06:27:59,569 --> 06:28:04,130
Where we go over it. Thank you so much for any artwork that you give I

2549
06:28:04,689 --> 06:28:10,020
I very strongly look forward to seeing it. That was a little league coach

2550
06:28:11,169 --> 06:28:14,209
Sit in a chair. My chair is out. Not even in this room

2551
06:28:15,259 --> 06:28:18,659
I had to move it

2552
06:28:18,659 --> 06:28:24,500
But what do you say we move on we've only got a little bit more we've got teapot for the five dollars and ten cents

2553
06:28:25,299 --> 06:28:28,830
Hey, german just wanted to apologize for last three when I sent a bit messages

2554
06:28:28,830 --> 06:28:32,270
That could have been taken as slightly offensive and didn't realize until afterward

2555
06:28:32,990 --> 06:28:34,990
When he stopped reading it out loud and skipped over it

2556
06:28:35,389 --> 06:28:38,509
It was my first time donating bits to a streamer. I wasn't trying to be an ass or anything

2557
06:28:38,509 --> 06:28:40,509
I hope you'll be able to accept my apology

2558
06:28:40,509 --> 06:28:44,270
Love the streams and love participating in chat and try to catch your streams whenever i'm not stuck at work

2559
06:28:46,799 --> 06:28:47,840
Um

2560
06:28:47,840 --> 06:28:49,840
Yeah, I don't i'm not really don't remember

2561
06:28:50,400 --> 06:28:52,880
Exactly what you're referring to but i'll tell you something right now

2562
06:28:54,159 --> 06:28:55,680
you've got the

2563
06:28:55,680 --> 06:29:01,119
You've got the wherewithal to maybe know maybe something you said was maybe not cool or something and you're accepting it

2564
06:29:02,479 --> 06:29:06,159
Figuring it out and you're learning and you're moving forward

2565
06:29:07,040 --> 06:29:08,319
That's all right

2566
06:29:08,319 --> 06:29:16,700
you know you you're

2567
06:29:16,700 --> 06:29:18,700
You've got you've got enough of a mind

2568
06:29:19,259 --> 06:29:20,959
maybe to

2569
06:29:20,959 --> 06:29:23,840
realize maybe something you said was wrong or stupid or

2570
06:29:24,799 --> 06:29:27,759
Bad or i'm not saying that but I don't know what you said, but

2571
06:29:28,639 --> 06:29:33,520
You know that takes not only that that takes some guts and it takes, you know a screwed on head. So

2572
06:29:37,419 --> 06:29:39,419
stupid

2573
06:29:40,299 --> 06:29:42,700
You sound like a dad

2574
06:29:42,700 --> 06:29:44,700
No, but that's like true though

2575
06:29:45,580 --> 06:29:50,220
Look, it'd be one thing. Okay. Imagine if if tpo imagine if instead it was five dollars and it said hey

2576
06:29:50,779 --> 06:29:53,180
Uh, you suck. I hate you pee pee poo poo

2577
06:29:53,580 --> 06:29:54,939
um

2578
06:29:54,939 --> 06:29:58,540
And then you kept going and you said like some offensive shit and you didn't realize you know

2579
06:30:04,130 --> 06:30:06,610
I mean, yeah, this is it's been like probably two days

2580
06:30:08,099 --> 06:30:11,060
You've already like gone. There it is. I know what I did was wrong

2581
06:30:13,360 --> 06:30:18,479
That can be ironic too. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know we're talking that's not pee pee poo poo is not offensive

2582
06:30:19,520 --> 06:30:20,880
It's not

2583
06:30:20,880 --> 06:30:22,080
That's like

2584
06:30:22,080 --> 06:30:24,240
Five-year-olds say that and laugh and run away

2585
06:30:25,220 --> 06:30:27,220
That's an offensive

2586
06:30:34,259 --> 06:30:35,700
Yes, it is

2587
06:30:35,700 --> 06:30:38,500
Well, I don't I don't I disagree

2588
06:30:48,450 --> 06:30:50,770
Yes, five-year-olds do make pee pee poo poo jokes

2589
06:30:53,580 --> 06:30:55,580
I will be facetimed by

2590
06:30:55,900 --> 06:30:57,900
relatives that have young children

2591
06:30:58,540 --> 06:31:04,459
And sometimes they'll just be being like, you know fresh and they'll lean over and be like it do do head

2592
06:31:04,619 --> 06:31:06,619
And then it's like, excuse me and they go

2593
06:31:07,340 --> 06:31:09,659
And then they like they run away and it's like, but don't say that

2594
06:31:10,459 --> 06:31:14,659
It's that still happens. So come on

2595
06:31:15,299 --> 06:31:22,240
Did you wash the shit out of your hair? Now? That's offensive

2596
06:31:22,799 --> 06:31:25,580
That offends me

2597
06:31:25,580 --> 06:31:27,819
I'm look forward to your apology tomorrow in bits

2598
06:31:28,380 --> 06:31:35,900
Tomorrow no teapot. Thanks for the five dollars. Don't worry about it. It's all good

2599
06:31:38,130 --> 06:31:40,430
Thanks for the five bucks

2600
06:31:40,430 --> 06:31:44,830
Lemon pudding. Thanks for the 250. You just said the best idea for a stream. Please do a puppet show stream

2601
06:31:48,400 --> 06:31:50,700
I don't know

2602
06:31:50,700 --> 06:31:58,750
I don't know about that

2603
06:31:58,750 --> 06:32:00,750
I don't think I could handle it. I don't think I could last

2604
06:32:04,669 --> 06:32:06,290
maybe

2605
06:32:06,290 --> 06:32:08,130
We'll see i'll think about it

2606
06:32:08,130 --> 06:32:10,849
But thank you for the uh for the recommendation

2607
06:32:11,490 --> 06:32:15,540
I have to go like this because I can't see the screen

2608
06:32:16,979 --> 06:32:21,299
Like this xbox. That's another reason why I don't want to do this for more than like six seven hours

2609
06:32:22,180 --> 06:32:24,979
This 360 is is gonna explode

2610
06:32:27,819 --> 06:32:29,819
It is I put my hand on this thing

2611
06:32:30,700 --> 06:32:32,700
It's it's like an electric blanket

2612
06:32:37,840 --> 06:32:39,599
But thank you to

2613
06:32:39,599 --> 06:32:42,000
Uh jake sunrise for the five dollars. It is a video

2614
06:32:42,880 --> 06:32:45,279
It's called germa the short king. We're gonna hold on to this

2615
06:32:46,080 --> 06:32:54,619
Because like I said, it is a video it is uh, artwork creative we're gonna hold on to it

2616
06:32:58,500 --> 06:33:00,500
Please when that channel is available

2617
06:33:00,740 --> 06:33:07,970
Throw that into that discord. So we got to start compiling them now. We have to start compiling these things

2618
06:33:11,540 --> 06:33:16,659
Don't worry. It's an xbox slim. Those don't red ring. They just melt. That's what I that's how is that better? That's way worse

2619
06:33:24,189 --> 06:33:28,509
But i'm banned from the discord. Uh, well, I don't know why that happened

2620
06:33:36,189 --> 06:33:40,110
But I want to start compiling these now and there's really only one way to do that and that's to start now

2621
06:33:46,180 --> 06:33:48,740
But thank you so much jake sunrise for the five bucks

2622
06:33:49,459 --> 06:33:51,459
I look forward to seeing this video

06:33:51,619 --> 06:33:53,520
Very soon

2624
06:33:53,520 --> 06:33:57,490
Thank you

2625
06:33:57,490 --> 06:33:59,889
What do you say we put on the credits? This is going to be ridiculous

2626
06:34:01,200 --> 06:34:03,759
There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of subs tonight

2627
06:34:07,819 --> 06:34:10,959
You said my name wrong again

2628
06:34:11,439 --> 06:34:13,439
jake sunshine

2629
06:34:13,680 --> 06:34:18,740
What did I say?

2630
06:34:18,740 --> 06:34:20,259
What did I say?

2631
06:34:20,259 --> 06:34:23,459
I didn't say that

2632
06:34:23,459 --> 06:34:25,139
Here they come

2633
06:34:25,139 --> 06:34:28,259
Here come all the subs all the sunrise. Oh

2634
06:34:30,939 --> 06:34:36,430
Shit

2635
06:34:36,430 --> 06:34:40,110
Thank you to s10w update for the two dollars and fifty cents. Hey germa

2636
06:34:40,669 --> 06:34:48,590
This reminds me of the time my parents got me three games for my birthday hulk hogan connect dragon ball connect and garfield show on the wii

2637
06:34:49,229 --> 06:34:53,389
So i'm glad someone else suffers with me. Hope you have dragon ball connect as well. Peace and love

2638
06:34:55,180 --> 06:34:57,180
Um, we'll see tomorrow

2639
06:34:58,880 --> 06:35:02,799
Garfield for the wii did they think that it was a xbox 360 game?

2640
06:35:04,130 --> 06:35:05,090
did

2641
06:35:05,090 --> 06:35:08,459
Did your parents just think that every console was the same console that's happened to be before?

2642
06:35:10,930 --> 06:35:12,209
Yes, uh-huh

2643
06:35:12,209 --> 06:35:16,240
Now you don't have the heart to tell them

2644
06:35:17,060 --> 06:35:22,340
Oh, thanks. Thanks garfield. I can't wait. I can't even play this. I can't do anything with this

2645
06:35:22,340 --> 06:35:24,340
I'm just gonna put it on under my bed or something

2646
06:35:28,619 --> 06:35:33,979
Everything is the same all consoles are the same consoles, especially if they went especially when they went to disc based

2647
06:35:34,619 --> 06:35:38,849
Once everything became a disc that got real confusing to all the parents

2648
06:35:46,509 --> 06:35:48,509
Looking for my name mine

2649
06:35:48,669 --> 06:35:49,869
I

2650
06:35:49,869 --> 06:35:57,229
Maybe you'll see it. Somebody said I fucking missed the stream. Hey, we got a vod right there and it's free

2651
06:35:57,549 --> 06:36:01,869
You can watch the whole thing. I recommend it. We had a lot of fun playing our connect

2652
06:36:02,590 --> 06:36:04,270
There's much more

2653
06:36:04,270 --> 06:36:08,099
I would dare say we got through a lot of the shitty ones today

2654
06:36:09,810 --> 06:36:14,689
No, what? No, there was like at least three or four. I had some of them had really good moments

2655
06:36:16,750 --> 06:36:18,750
Our connect it's ours

2656
06:36:22,080 --> 06:36:24,080
Uh, thank you though. Thank you to

06:36:54,080 --> 06:36:58,900
He's upset with me

2664
06:36:58,900 --> 06:37:09,200
Bilactory lich gave another fifteen dollars and 89 cents and then the great canadian fk club

That was fucking hundreds of subs before

2668
06:37:23,500 --> 06:37:26,220
He's back now. He's still right. They're still wrong

Your uncountable amount of money that you've given today and two streams ago

2679
06:38:01,869 --> 06:38:05,549
Uh, I just finally got to see a doctor about my adhd and got medication for it

2680
06:38:05,950 --> 06:38:11,069
It's changed my life for the better good stream today germa best on twitch in my opinion. Appreciate that opinion

And thank you for the ridiculous amounts of money

2683
06:38:18,380 --> 06:38:23,340
Speaking of money the tingy just came in with five community subs right back to back five community gifted sub

2684
06:38:24,139 --> 06:38:27,220
They're flying around all over the place

2685
06:38:27,680 --> 06:38:29,040
In every direction

2686
06:38:29,040 --> 06:38:31,790
Do you hear this in your left ear?

2687
06:38:31,869 --> 06:38:34,750
Do I have one of those microphones? Tell me which ear this comes in

2688
06:38:37,119 --> 06:38:39,119
Hey, what's going on? It's me over here

2689
06:38:39,279 --> 06:38:41,520
Hey, what's going on? It's me over here. Does that change your ear?

2690
06:38:42,240 --> 06:38:45,659
It's both ears. Yeah, whatever. I don't have one of those cool mics

2691
06:38:46,619 --> 06:38:52,290
But thank you both of you for the five gifted subs and thank you if I liked your lich

2692
06:38:53,310 --> 06:38:57,709
I used to when I was younger. I did medication for adhd but it messed up my appetite

2693
06:38:58,349 --> 06:39:00,770
So I stopped doing it

2694
06:39:00,770 --> 06:39:06,849
You know, i'm a smaller frame person. So when I was on medication and it was kind of stunting my appetite

2695
06:39:07,650 --> 06:39:09,650
I really

2696
06:39:10,049 --> 06:39:12,049
I just I just wasn't good for me

2697
06:39:12,209 --> 06:39:13,250
so

2698
06:39:13,250 --> 06:39:18,259
When I went off of it, I went back to eating normally again and really haven't taken any medication since

2699
06:39:23,759 --> 06:39:25,759
Yeah, i'm broadcasting in mono. I have to

2700
06:39:33,380 --> 06:39:35,860
Oh booze in the chat booze here booze in the chat

2701
06:39:40,610 --> 06:39:42,130
Playing wow classic

2702
06:39:42,130 --> 06:39:52,459
Remember when I was in shape I do but i'm also getting i'm like i'm going to that stage of life where

2703
06:39:52,939 --> 06:39:54,939
I got all the things that I have to worry about

2704
06:39:55,259 --> 06:40:01,020
Besides getting huge

2705
06:40:01,020 --> 06:40:03,020
I don't know. I think it will suck

2706
06:40:03,729 --> 06:40:10,819
