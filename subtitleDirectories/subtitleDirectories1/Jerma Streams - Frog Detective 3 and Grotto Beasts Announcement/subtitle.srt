1
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,300
What up? How are you doing? What's happening?

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:31,539
You know, I made a promise back.

3
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,049
I want to say in late January.

4
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:40,219
That promise was going to play

5
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,219
Frog Detective 3 before the end of February.

6
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,619
So I don't have to eat any weird objects.

7
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:54,119
Frog Detective 3 is what's happening today.

8
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:03,659
Make sure I tweet. That's correct.

9
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,659
So not just Frog Detective 3.

10
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,030
There's going to be something else we're going to talk about today.

11
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,030
I know a lot of you have been eagerly, eagerly anticipating

12
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,680
any news on Grotto Beasts.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,519
And that is exactly what we're going to talk about later tonight.

14
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,519
Grotto Beasts tonight is going to go into pre-sale.

15
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,079
We're going to go over everything.

16
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,079
There's a lot to talk about.

17
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,079
I have a presentation for you.

18
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:41,700
We've waited so long tonight.

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,939
Grotto Beasts goes into pre-sale tonight.

20
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,620
Power Point Andy. That's right.

21
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:55,829
Let's freaking go. You know what?

22
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,390
I'll give you a let's freaking go.

23
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:05,239
Elden Ring DLC. Did you see that?

24
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:10,400
It's getting kind of crazy out there.

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,150
Elden Ring DLC got announced as well. I didn't know.

26
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,150
Who knows when it's going to be done, but at least they told us it's coming.

27
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,159
Hey, this is in development.

28
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,159
All of you shut up already.

29
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:35,270
Everybody quiet.

30
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,979
Because I've been waiting for that too.

31
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:42,979
Let's see what they do. It's very exciting.

32
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:48,719
Whenever it's done, it's done. Sounds good.

33
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,719
We're going to play some Rogue Detective 3.

34
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,719
I'm not going to immediately talk about Grotto Beasts.

35
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,719
I want enough people to get trickled into the stream.

36
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:04,210
There's a lot of info. You're such a silly guy.

37
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:11,479
What horse did you vote for?

38
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,979
Oh, this thing. I didn't know.

39
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:25,110
I didn't do anything. What about Hylix?

40
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,080
Then they growled at me.

41
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,379
It was play Hylix or break a huge promise I made to chat a month ago.

42
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:51,379
I have to go with the promise.

43
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,699
That is frog time. You lied to Europe.

44
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,699
I'm operating in the United States of America.

45
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:02,389
The United States of America is where I operate from.

46
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,389
It is currently 6 p.m. in the United States of America.

47
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,639
What's my favorite song?

48
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:24,230
I don't know. Hylix will be after this.

49
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:30,269
Probably in the next couple of days.

50
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:34,149
Why do you hate Europeans? I don't hate Europeans.

51
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,149
I just burped.

52
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:40,899
I'm going to shit my pants right there.

53
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:43,899
Oh, guys. Grotto Beast is coming.

54
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,899
I don't have to leave the stream.

55
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:54,819
That would be really funny.

56
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,819
Announcement stream. Grotto Beast pre-sales.

57
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:00,819
I have to leave. See you in a week.

58
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:04,699
You better not bad-chest me.

59
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:10,750
I will be furious.

60
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,750
I'm not going to delay anymore.

61
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,120
If you don't like voices, mute the stream.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,120
This is all I'm going to be doing for the next three hours.

63
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,660
Is that Elden Ring news?

64
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:32,810
How dare you.

65
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:43,259
Hey, there it is.

66
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,259
This is Frog Detective 3 Corruption at Cowboy County.

67
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,420
What's going to happen here is

68
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,420
there will be about three voices the whole stream.

69
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:01,939
Spread out over probably 10 characters.

70
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:05,620
There's the Frog Detective voice actor back.

71
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:22,800
They were very expensive.

72
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I can't find your notebook in my records.

73
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:34,209
Could you please remind me of what it looks like?

74
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:39,819
Oh, I uninstalled the first two games. Does that matter?

75
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:43,569
Is that bad?

76
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:51,459
It's been like a year. What did I do?

77
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:56,689
Did I screw it up?

78
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:04,009
Frog Detective 2, I played like a year and a half ago, didn't I?

79
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:10,319
You've ruined the experience.

80
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,399
No, I didn't. I just made it again.

81
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,339
You guys aren't cleaning out your PC's computer and shit?

82
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:28,420
You guys aren't cleaning out your PC?

83
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,790
If I have not opened an application

84
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:37,319
in at least six months, it goes.

85
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:50,850
I've got to free up that space. No, I don't want that.

86
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:59,000
He won the trophy and a sunflower.

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:27,300
I want him to be holding the trophy.

88
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:36,759
I'm happy with that. Looks good.

89
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,919
What about the spider? Put a hat on.

90
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,690
And a magnifying glass. And a spider.

91
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:57,379
Alright, that's good. I'm done. That's a good book. Yeah.

92
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:00,620
Hey, it's Mary. Remember me?

93
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,049
I know it's been a while, so I thought I'd give you a quick recap.

94
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:07,289
After the detective, that's you, solved the case of the invisible wizard

95
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:11,279
a mysterious phone call came in.

96
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,289
Well, it wasn't that mysterious. It was the supervisor, as usual.

97
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:20,429
But the contents of the phone call were mysterious, you know.

98
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:26,870
Okay, so let's set the scene. I'm a good actress.

99
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:33,870
Okay, WSD. So it doesn't have my save file.

100
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:44,580
Hello?

101
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,870
Oh my gosh, hey, it's me, Detective Frog.

102
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,870
Hey, gorgeous, I'm the supervisor. I'm kind of like your boss,

103
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,620
but not officially. Oh my gosh, I know.

104
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,799
It's so hard to describe a professional relationship.

105
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,759
But you're like a helper of sorts. Yes, exactly. Like a manager almost.

106
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,639
Yeah. Okay, so I have a new mystery for you. Can you even believe it?

107
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,649
Yes, haha. That's my job, to solve mysteries.

108
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,789
Classic supervisor. Okay, so what's the case about, babe?

109
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:23,799
I love your enthusiasm, but it's actually really sensitive,

110
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:28,940
so I can't tell you on the phone. Ah, boo.

111
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,259
I know, bummer. Makes it so much more exciting, though.

112
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:38,590
For sure, yeah. You do me a huge favor, lovely.

113
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,049
Grab your magnifying glass next to the door and head to the train station.

114
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:47,309
There's a ticket for you there. It'll take you on a little trip.

115
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:51,860
Cute. Okay, auto. Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

116
00:10:51,860 --> 00:11:00,669
Thanks, love. Later.

117
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:10,100
Great hours. Magnifying glass? Sick.

118
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,559
Now I can solve the case. I'm the frog detective.

119
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:24,820
Got your magnifying glass. Good. This game is 100 hours?

120
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:30,240
Damn it. I hate when people just fucking lie to my face.

121
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:46,580
Oh, this is weird. Okay, that's gonna make me puke.

122
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Okay, so the detective heads to the train station and it's all so cool.

123
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,230
Like there's a new color scheme and stuff. Can you believe it?

124
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,370
Someone literally takes the detective's notebook. It's so messed up.

125
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,490
Actual tears in my eyes, seriously.

126
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,620
I don't think the detective knows about the stolen notebook yet.

127
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,299
So, you're actually up to date now.

128
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,299
Please, if you could leave a review of my acting skills, I'd super appreciate it.

129
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:29,049
Okay, enjoy the case. Nice. Everybody get ready.

130
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:45,889
Are you guys ready? Oh my god.

131
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:58,070
So what's going on here? What's going on here? Can I ride that?

132
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,070
Hello, this is Frog Detective from Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency speaking.

133
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,090
How can I help you? Why did you answer the phone like that?

134
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,779
What's that supposed to mean, surprise? This is a random phone on the street.

135
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:15,919
I'm the only one here. You don't think it's a little weird?

136
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,490
Not really. You're the one making a phone call to a random phone.

137
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,500
Because I knew you'd be there. Now who's the weird one?

138
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:32,559
Regardless, I'm glad you picked up. I'm sure you're curious about this mystery.

139
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,000
I sure am. Give me the details, please.

140
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,799
I cannot. Someone may be listening. What? Who?

141
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,679
I saw on the internet that it's possible for strangers to listen to phone calls.

142
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,350
Who said that? My cousin wrote all about it on his blog.

143
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,539
Okay. Well, if you're not going to tell me details, why did you call?

144
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,980
I have a special surprise for you.

145
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,179
As you know, the terrain of Cowboy County is vast and rough.

146
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:07,539
I've ordered something special from Whiz Bay to help you get around.

147
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:13,299
Oh, is it a horse? What? No. Why would you say that?

148
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:19,659
It's a cowboy town. What do you mean?

149
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:24,360
Cowboys ride horses. Are you being serious?

150
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,659
Horses are valued members of society.

151
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,840
It would be demeaning to ride them around. It's messed up that you would even say that.

152
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,789
Right. Sorry. I just got confused. Don't worry about it.

153
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:41,870
What did you order, then? A scooter, of course.

154
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,309
Sick. Should be next to you in the phone booth.

155
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:50,450
Bold choice to have it shipped to a public phone booth.

156
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,889
Please stop questioning my choices.

157
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,889
Anyway, when you're ready, pick up the scooter and get some practice in.

158
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:01,639
Lobster Cop arrived early and I will be waiting for you at the town.

159
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:06,889
Just follow the path and meet him and have fun. Hope you have fun, too.

160
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:14,460
I will. All right. See you.

161
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:24,100
Acting, acting, acting, acting, acting. My very own scooter.

162
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:32,259
Sick. Got a scooter.

163
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:37,419
Two out of three voices. You haven't heard the third one yet.

164
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:46,909
You haven't heard the third one yet. Come on. Wait, what?

165
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:54,700
They added... All right, this is interesting. Can I go off like a jump?

166
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:00,240
Frog Detective 3. Cowboy County.

167
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Prime or whatever. In the first 10 minutes, he breaks his fucking ankle.

168
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:16,620
That's kind of cool. So where should I go from here?

169
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:31,419
It's actually fun to move around.

170
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:35,820
Superhot Presents. Game by Worm Club.

171
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:44,419

172
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:55,139
Starring Lobster Cop.

173
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,580
All right, I got to get voices for these.

174
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:05,769
Suzy Rabbit. German and the Bandits.

175
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:14,819
Frog Detective. Plus a special guest.

176
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:34,339
What's the mystery? Oh, cool.

177
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:37,339
Frog Detective 3. Corruption at Cowboy County.

178
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:50,220
Oh, the clapping.

179
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:55,049
Theater Kid. You know what?

180
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,049
Hey, I get to do this at least once every few months.

181
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:08,460
All right, come on. All right, moment of truth.

182
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,859
Well, I...

183
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:18,549
Hey, Lobster Cop. I'm here to help solve a mystery.

184
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,049
Right on time, Detective. I'm known worldwide for my timeliness.

185
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:28,900
Is that so? No.

186
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,220
Can you tell me about the case, Lobster Cop? I sure can.

187
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,220
We've been sent here to solve the conundrum of the Sheriffless County.

188
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,180
This town was thriving, Detective.

189
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,490
Marvel of productivity, friendship, community, and cowboys.

190
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,119
But there was something missing. The Sheriff?

191
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:56,299
Yeah. I was kind of leading up to that.

192
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:59,920
My bad. For the sake of storytelling, can you please not interrupt me?

193
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:06,730
I sincerely apologize.

194
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,730
Somebody says Bugleberry?

195
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,740
That's not Bugleberry?

196
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,740
Yeah, that's Jimmy Stewart. That's not Bugleberry.

197
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:23,799
That's Jimmy Stewart.

198
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,750
I'm staying with Jimmy Stewart. I don't care.

199
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,400
So, anyway, I've lost where I was going with this.

200
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,250
You said there was something missing.

201
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,549
Right, there was something missing. A sheriff.

202
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,549
Well, the town had realized that for all these years,

203
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:49,500
they were missing a vital ingredient for cowboy living.

204
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,930
They contacted the supervisor, and he contacted me.

205
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,049
Anyway, here we are.

206
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:00,480
I'm going to be honest, Lobster Cop. The supervisor really hyped this case up.

207
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,410
Like, there are two of us here.

208
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,420
To facilitate hiring for a management position?

209
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,779
Detective, you've read my mind.

210
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,599
The supervisor really dropped the ball.

211
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,660
Did you really think I'd need your help?

212
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,609
No, me neither. And as it turns out, I don't need your help.

213
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:27,609
It's kind of turning into Mr. Ed.

214
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:36,849
Whatever. The position has been filled.

215
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:41,220
Oh, I knew the perfect boy for the job.

216
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:48,609
Presenting the new sheriff of Cowboy County.

217
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:52,490
Sheriff Mason Mole.

218
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,789
Well, congratulations on such a speedy resolution, Lobster Cop.

219
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,170
Thank you.

220
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:05,869
Well, I guess I'll head back to the office.

221
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:13,259
No, no, no.

222
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,799
No, no, no.

223
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,750
No, no.

224
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,130
No, no, no.

225
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,930
No, no, no.

226
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:37,869
No, you cannot.

227
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:41,559
Voice selector.

228
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,559
Voice one, voice two, voice three, voice one, voice...

229
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,559
No, it's voice one, voice two, voice three.

230
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,559
Voice one A, one B, one C. Voice one D, one...

231
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,630
You know what I mean?

232
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,789
No, you cannot. Fuck.

233
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:04,680
No, you cannot. Is there something you need help with?

234
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,079
This. What is it, Sheriff Mason Mole?

235
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,710
Mystery. Prime mystery.

236
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,210
Please solve this. What's a mystery?

237
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:28,339
It's the same fucking person. Hold on.

238
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:32,529
All hats have been stolen.

239
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:36,519
You're wearing a hat. Not my hat. Town hats.

240
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:39,950
Can you elaborate? All the hats in the town have been stolen.

241
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,349
Please solve this mystery as soon as possible.

242
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:49,470
Do you have any leads? No. Get to work, please.

243
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,029
Well, you heard the sheriff.

244
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:57,839
Okay. Is there really no additional information?

245
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,769
No. But here's your notebook.

246
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:05,579
I'm sorry? Here, notebook.

247
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:11,829
Somebody mailed it to you. Oh, we got a notebook.

248
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:16,029
I didn't even know it was missing.

249
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:21,289
Not missing. It's right here.

250
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:27,140
Question? No, I'm busy. Goodbye.

251
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,819
Oh, what a legend.

252
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:34,130
You know each other? Sure, but how much can you really know someone, right?

253
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,190
What? Don't worry about it.

254
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,190
Now, Detective, as I am the lead investigator on this case,

255
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,650
I trust you will follow my guidance.

256
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,339
Oh, I didn't know you were the lead. It's a safe assumption to make.

257
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:55,289
Right, of course. So I'll be investigating leads,

258
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:59,660
but I could use your assistance. Sure, what do you need?

259
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,289
I'll handle the motive and the suspects.

260
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:07,299
You handle the crime scene and method.

261
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:10,730
Okay. It's an easier task for a rookie like you.

262
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,970
All you need to do is find a map of the crime scene,

263
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,970
a tool capable of aiding criminal activity,

264
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,970
a key that could lead us to the clue,

265
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,970
and lastly, not to mention most importantly,

266
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,529
a meal for the number one best detective.

267
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:31,529
A meal? Yes, Detective.

268
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:34,529
Keep up. I'm a very hungry boy and will need sustenance

269
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:38,470
to solve the mystery.

270
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,470
I have some sandwiches I was saving for afternoon, and my name is Otto.

271
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:47,319
Tea, if you'd like them. No, I need a proper meal.

272
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:52,660
I hear you loud and clear. I'll make sure to get those for you.

273
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,660
If you need to be reminded of what I want, come and see me by the graveyard.

274
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,660
It's goofy as well.

275
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,660
It's goofy and Mr. Ed and, I don't know, a few in there.

276
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,539
Will do. Good luck, lobster cop.

277
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:14,250
I don't need it. Good luck, Detective.

278
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,440
All right, so we've got to find case three.

279
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,160
Mystery of the missing hats. Incredibly important.

280
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:30,049
Lobster cop. Motive. There's no possible motive

281
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:33,049
for lobster cop to do this.

282
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:36,349
He wants a crime scene map, criminal tool, key, and a meal.

283
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:40,170
Okay, lobster cop, number one best detective. I'm very jealous.

284
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:46,799
So tall. That's all we've got on lobster cop right now.

285
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,920
All right, so we've got to find a crime scene map,

286
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:57,470
criminal tool, key, and a meal.

287
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:09,210
I'm going this way first. Whoops. Oh, right, I have this.

288
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:27,900
No secrets back here or anything? Ooh, wait a minute. What's this?

289
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,079
Such beautiful flowers. Very spiky looking, too.

290
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:39,180
Hmm. TV land Andy.

291
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:48,359
A boomerang. It's all coming back to you.

292
00:26:48,359 --> 00:27:03,549
Snake? A cute snake. Okay, so that's cool. That's up there.

293
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:06,549
Okay, so there's a flower up there. I've got to remember that.

294
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:13,940
Should I go in here? Okay, I can't go in. All right, here we go.

295
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,839
Hey. Hey. You.

296
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:24,140
Me? Yeah, you. Can you do me a favor?

297
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,970
Um, it depends on a favor. What?

298
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,970
I can't just agree to doing you a favor. I don't know who you are.

299
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,720
I'm Su... What is it? Suzy Rabbit? What is it?

300
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:44,369
Is it Sussy Rabbit or Suzy Rabbit? What is it?

301
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:52,009
How do I pronounce this? Rip chat. Yeah.

302
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:56,849
I think it's... Yeah, no, I got it right.

303
00:27:56,849 --> 00:28:01,849
I'm Suzy Rabbit. Can you do me a favor?

304
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,849
You're the best. Thanks. I need you to help me break into this bank.

305
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:11,940
What? I will not. Huh?

306
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,440
Dude, you already agreed to it. I don't appreciate you lying to me.

307
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,380
If you said you'd do me a favor, you should keep your word.

308
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,009
I didn't agree to the favor. Oh, so now you're changing the story.

309
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:30,519
Whatever, dude. Just leave me alone.

310
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:48,059
What the heck? Break into the bank? Excuse me.

311
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:56,730
Suzy Rabbit? Hello? It's me. Frog Detective.

312
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,599
Yeah, I know. They should call you the Flake.

313
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:09,880
Why? Because you always flake on your promises.

314
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,890
I'm going to have to break in on my own now. I don't think that's a good idea.

315
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,710
Okay, I didn't ask. Why are you breaking in anyways?

316
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:23,220
Bit nosy for someone who doesn't want to help. Being nosy is my job.

317
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,339
Fine. I don't have any IDs so I can't get into my vault.

318
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:32,099
Oh, so you only want to steal things that belong to you?

319
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:37,500
Yeah. Surely there's another way of getting in there.

320
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,170
Getting them. Oh, so now you want to help.

321
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,049
Typical. I just mean, breaking in sounds dangerous.

322
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:48,289
Breaking in sounds dangerous. You could get hurt.

323
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:52,099
I heard all these banks are booby-trapped. Why?

324
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:56,609
So people don't break in. What's wrong with breaking in?

325
00:29:56,609 --> 00:30:00,539
Well, the point of a bank is to keep valuables safe.

326
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,839
If people can break in, it kind of defeats the purpose of a bank.

327
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:10,650
I'm starting to get it. It's so annoying.

328
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,950
I have a piece of evidence that's vital to the missing hats case.

329
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:18,650
Wait, what? I can really use that.

330
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,460
Oh, so you will help me. I really shouldn't.

331
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,559
What kind of evidence? It's a map.

332
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,119
And I think it might lead to where the hats are hidden.

333
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,119
I found it this morning, right after the hats were stolen.

334
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,119
It had big letters on the top that said,

335
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,420
crime map, eat after reading. I didn't eat it, obviously.

336
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:47,250
That's good. Maybe there's another way to get into the vault.

337
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:54,230
Can I ask you some questions? All right. Let's go.

338
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:59,440
About that vital piece of evidence, the map.

339
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,130
What about it? What can you tell me about it?

340
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,380
It was a map of the graveyard, I think.

341
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,130
Oh, that's helpful. Barely helpful.

342
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,130
The graveyard is massive. You'd be looking forever

343
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,130
without some guide to tell you where to go.

344
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,750
Besides, it's super haunted up there. I wouldn't want to spend too long looking around.

345
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,960
It's haunted? That's what the rumors say.

346
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,339
Do you remember anything else about that map? No, not really.

347
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:33,900
Listen, if you can help me get into my vault, it's all yours. That sounds like a good deal.

348
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,849
I'll do my best. Can I ask you some questions?

349
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:44,309
Let's brainstorm ideas to get into the vault.

350
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:48,380
Oh, sure. What about we kick the bank teller?

351
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,740
Absolutely not. Joking, obviously.

352
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,859
Were you? No, I was not.

353
00:31:56,859 --> 00:32:01,819
Okay, new idea. We'll find your ID.

354
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:05,119
I'm going to be honest with you, detective. What is it?

355
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:11,019
I'm pretty sure my ID is in the bank vault. Oh, that's a conundrum.

356
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:14,900
Yeah, but there's a silver lining. We live in a town

357
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,460
filled with outlaws. I don't live here.

358
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,470
You'll know how to make a fake ID. Is that against the rules?

359
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:29,109
What rules? Bank rules?

360
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:33,380
It's my vault. What are they going to do, ban me from my own possessions?

361
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,750
I suppose not. Great, so it's settled. You'll get me a fake ID.

362
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:47,380
What? No. Suit yourself.

363
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:53,220
Theoretically, if I were to help. Yes, thank you.

364
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,279
I'll wait right here. Thank you, detective. Okay.

365
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:04,150
Mind if I ask you some more questions? Okay, so we got to get into the vault.

366
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:11,299
We have to get a fake ID. Small enemy survivor.

367
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:17,019
I'm destroying you.

368
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:20,190
I'm being outclassed in our conversation.

369
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:27,579
Okay, short temper.

370
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:31,140
Ethical criminal, not a big believer in rules.

371
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:46,839
Needs a fake ID, yikes. I need an ID.

372
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:56,609
I'll come back in a minute because I have to figure out what you're going to sound like.

373
00:33:56,609 --> 00:34:05,380
Guys! Guys, look!

374
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:11,019
Small enemy. Spider.

375
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:14,019
Holy shit, guys, it's the- Small enemy. Spider.

376
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:27,539
What the heck? Enemy. I forgot how you talk.

377
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:59,840
R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.

378
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,739
Okay, Mason Mole, motive.

379
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:09,760
Wanted to be the only person in town with a hat. To be left alone, it seems, okay.

380
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,960
Fellow a few words, previous job helped out.

381
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:29,780
Helped out. Interesting.

382
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:41,159
Hmm. Hmm. What's this?

383
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,400
Ooh, these could come in handy. Ah, get it? Handy. Gloves.

384
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,619
Excuse me. Yes, sheriff? Those are evidence.

385
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:57,280
Evidence of what? Crime. Oh, I'll leave them here.

386
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,340
No. No? Take them. Aren't they evidence?

387
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:08,219
Aren't they evidence? Not yet. Cool.

388
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:19,530
What? Alright, so I got gloves. Does anybody need gloves?

389
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:35,449
I know everybody's waiting for what character is going to be Bernie Sanders and what character is going to be Donald Trump.

390
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:39,449
Everyone's waiting. Everyone's like, which one is going to be Bernie Sanders?

391
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:42,449
Right? I know. Everyone's waiting for it. But what if I pivot?

392
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:45,820
What if it's not Bernie Sanders? Right? What if it's not?

393
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:55,710
What if I don't do Bernie Sanders?

394
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,710
Excuse me, Mr. Satan. Yeah, you guys, you know the drill.

395
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:04,730
Okay, am I ready?

396
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:16,539
If you're here from the Evil Secret Society, please leave me alone. I'm not interested in joining.

397
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:19,289
What's the Evil Secret Society?

398
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:25,010
That's right. I know the society's tricks.

399
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,760
Well, I'm actually here from Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.

400
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,579
Oh, yeah? Where are your credentials then?

401
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:39,579
Well, I'm a detective. I am Frog, and I'm here to solve a mystery slash possible crime.

402
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:43,590
Do you have any identification?

403
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,539
Just my face.

404
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:48,219
Do you have identification?

405
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:51,909
No, but I'm Craig. Everybody knows me.

406
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:57,280
I wouldn't normally believe you, but my appearance does seem to match what you're saying.

407
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,030
But just know, I don't trust you.

408
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,300
I wouldn't expect you to. We just met.

409
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,050
Detective, I'm someone that's regularly messed with.

410
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:12,050
There are many different societies around here, and they all want me to join.

411
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:17,349
But I'm a lone ranger. I have no interest in being a part of these secret societies.

412
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:20,619
What types of secret societies are there?

413
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:25,369
For starters, you've got the naughty little guys. They've been after me for years.

414
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:28,739
The posties are another one. They go around delivering mail.

415
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:35,860
I'm not sure that's a secret society. I think it's more of a public service.

416
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,860
Then why can't we open everybody's mail? Not so public if you ask me.

417
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,550
Open your eyes. Another society is the Ghost Spotters League.

418
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,010
Oh wait, I think I've heard of them.

419
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,019
Yes, despite being a secret society, they're quite well known.

420
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:57,380
To be honest with you, I said earlier that I wasn't interested in being a part of any societies, but that's only half true.

421
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,579
Oh.

422
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:04,889
The Ghost Spotters League is really exclusive, and I'm kind of bummed that they never tried to recruit me.

423
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:08,019
Are you a keen ghost spotter?

424
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:16,139
Well, that might be the problem. To be inducted into the league, you need to have a... you have to have a spot at the ghost.

425
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:19,780
And you haven't seen any?

426
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,340
Correct. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. You could be anyone.

427
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,409
I'm the detective.

428
00:40:26,409 --> 00:40:33,369
It's a compelling disguise, I'll give you that. Do you know much about ghosts?

429
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:41,380
Well, I solved a mystery involving one. The mystery of the haunted island. Although, it wasn't haunted in the end.

430
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:48,340
So no. You could have saved us both time and just said no.

431
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,420
Sorry, no. I don't know much about ghosts. Can I ask you some questions?

432
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,909
Everybody always wants information from me.

433
00:40:55,909 --> 00:41:01,349
Secret societies.

434
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:09,300
This is a sped up Mr. Satan. The only difference is that I don't say Goku at the end.

435
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:18,460
I don't suppose there's a secret society that is dedicated to stealing hats.

436
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:26,059
Not that I'm aware of. But that's the thing, detective. Those societies run deep. I've barely scratched the surface of what there is to know.

437
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:32,460
They run everything. Everywhere you've ever been. Anything you've ever done. It's all dictated by the secret societies.

438
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,699
Surely that can't be true.

439
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:37,900
You'd think not, but it is true.

440
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,460
How do you know it's true?

441
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,719
I'm part of several forums dedicated to uncovering the truth.

442
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,719
Is it a secret forum?

443
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,219
What?

444
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:51,219
Like, is the forum also a secret society?

445
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:56,300
I never thought of that. I had to look into it.

446
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,130
No, I'm just joking.

447
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,130
I don't see how you can joke about something like this. Secret societies run everything.

448
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:07,329
Craig, I just don't think that's true.

449
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:11,579
Oh yeah? What evidence do you have that it's not true?

450
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,880
None, I suppose. Just a lack of evidence of it being true.

451
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:22,860
I would say it's more a lack of evidence of it not being true.

452
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,860
Agree to disagree.

453
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,539
I'll agree to be right, and you agree to be wrong.

454
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:34,949
Okay, sure. How close are you to spotting a ghost?

455
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:38,769
What kind of question is that? How am I supposed to know?

456
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:43,139
Ghosts aren't cool bugs, detective. You can't just spot them out and about.

457
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:45,400
How does it work, then?

458
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,019
Well, the requirements are pretty flexible.

459
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:51,389
Basically, the society needs a credible ghost-citing story.

460
00:42:51,389 --> 00:42:54,389
Or tangible proof of a ghost, like a photo.

461
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:57,530
Do ghosts show up in photos?

462
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:04,389
It depends, but yeah. The saloon has a bunch of photos, but I don't want to send in the wrong one and embarrass myself.

463
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:09,269
I don't know which ones are of ghosts and which ones are just normal photos.

464
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:12,409
Hmm, sounds like a bit of a puzzle.

465
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:18,739
They're so strict. If I get my applications denied three times, I'm banned from ever replying again.

466
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:19,739
I'm on my second strike.

467
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:23,380
What'd you send in the first two times?

468
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:31,210
I faked the first two sightings. I dressed up as a ghost and ran really fast, so I looked like a blur in the photograph.

469
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:37,710
They're so clever that they figured me out right away. That's how I know they're the real deal.

470
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,019
I like your creativity, though.

471
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:45,070
Thanks. Say, if you happen to have a spot, stop by the saloon.

472
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:48,070
Could you take a look and see if you can tell which one of those photos has a ghost in it?

473
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:52,440
I don't really care about actually spotting a ghost myself. I just want to be a part of the society.

474
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,090
I suppose that's fair enough. Sure, I'll have time. I'll take a look.

475
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:08,170
Thanks.

476
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:13,110
Are there two people doing these voices? Batches.

477
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:25,219
Dude, yeah, there is. No, there's only one, dude. There's only one person doing the voice. What the fuck? No fucking way.

478
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:31,659
Okay. Wants membership to the secret society. No, wants to the secret hat stealing society.

479
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:34,090
Okay, we got to go in the saloon.

480
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:50,010
Let's not buy my detective disguised rat. What's going on here? He's cute.

481
00:44:50,010 --> 00:45:04,289
Oh, hey, Craig. Okay, so find the real photo of a ghost.

482
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:27,980
Let me do that now so I don't forget. Do I need a camera?

483
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:36,170
Is it in the go? Oh, okay. Wait, wait, wait. I have to prove that one of these has a ghost in it?

484
00:45:36,170 --> 00:46:02,460
You're killing it right now. Maybe I have to get another item.

485
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,699
Well, if it isn't the frog of the hour.

486
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:10,510
Maybe the frog of one and a half hours, if we're being generous.

487
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:17,809
45 minutes if you're speedy. Well, you get what I mean. It's good to see you, detective.

488
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,179
Have we met?

489
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:25,619
Not in person, no. I've sent you several emails asking to illustrate your frog blog.

490
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,619
Oh, you must be Pistol.

491
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:34,300
That's me. Finest artist in all of Cowboy County, and potentially the world.

492
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,300
Yes, you mentioned that many times in your emails.

493
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,239
It's a shame we haven't been able to work together. Your stories come to me so visually.

494
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:43,239
I'd love to illustrate them.

495
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:48,619
I'd love that too. Unfortunately, I do not have a million money to pay you with.

496
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:51,820
It's actually two million money.

497
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,179
Yes, yes, sorry.

498
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:58,809
No matter, detective. Simply keep saving up and you'll be able to afford my work one day.

499
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:05,340
I'll do that. Are you working on something at the moment?

500
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:10,909
Yes, my finest piece yet. It's...

501
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:18,699
Well, you see, it's clearly a... Who am I kidding, detective?

502
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:20,699
I've lost my artistic touch.

503
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:23,699
Well, I'm sure it's just a bit of a creative block.

504
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:33,389
Creative block? No. I clicked on a banner on cyberspace and it took me to a strange website.

505
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:34,389
What did the banner say?

506
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:39,019
Click here for an epic video of a worm who's buff.

507
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:40,019
You were right to click it.

508
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:44,210
When it loaded, it was just a scary picture of a witch.

509
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,280
It made a loud cackling noise and the screen just said,

510
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,349
You just got a curse on you from this website.

511
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:54,349
Ever since then, I have lost my artistic talents.

512
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:57,219
That's terrible. When did that happen?

513
00:47:57,219 --> 00:47:58,780
Earlier today.

514
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,780
I don't mean to doubt you, but are you sure it wasn't just a prank?

515
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,730
Prank? I don't think so.

516
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:11,360
That witch was really scary and I'm normally very brave.

517
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,360
Did the website have any specifics about the curse?

518
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,920
No.

519
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,860
Well, how do you know the curse is on your artistic talents?

520
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,940
It's been three hours and I haven't found my latest muse.

521
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,750
A muse?

522
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,380
You know, a subject that piques my interest.

523
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,619
Every day I find one and today I haven't seen anything that inspires me.

524
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,690
Can I ask you some questions?

525
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,940
Go ahead.

526
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,940
The worm back there is so fucking cool.

527
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,199
Alright, you need a muse.

528
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:44,590
You mentioned needing a muse.

529
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,659
I'm cursed to never have one.

530
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:51,300
Well, it's only been a few hours. One might show up.

531
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,599
I doubt it.

532
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:54,599
I think this is the end of my painting career.

533
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,489
Don't give up. What if I can help you find a muse?

534
00:48:59,489 --> 00:49:01,239
You want to help me?

535
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:04,230
I'd love to. Let me think.

536
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:07,239
Maybe you could draw me.

537
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,630
I have no interest in drawing you.

538
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,380
That's understandable.

539
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,619
Hmm.

540
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:18,699
If you can find me a photograph of something compelling to draw, I would be very grateful.

541
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:21,320
But I think it might be too much of a challenge.

542
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,940
Nothing is too much of a challenge for me.

543
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,400
What about putting on a hat?

544
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,980
No comment.

545
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,119
Your head is a weird shape.

546
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:38,420
I know. I'll get to work finding a photograph for you to draw.

547
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,039
Thank you, detective. I wish you the best of luck.

548
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:43,789
Can I ask you something else?

549
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:45,349
Go ahead.

550
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:51,920
Can you tell me more about the curse from that website you visited?

551
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,670
I don't know what more there is to say.

552
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,230
I wanted to see a video of a buff worm and I was tricked, fooled.

553
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,730
Cyber space can be a really troubling place.

554
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,420
Everybody warned me.

555
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,230
On the bright side, I clicked on a banner that said,

556
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,539
I was the one thousandth visitor and I won a hundred thousand money.

557
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:12,099
What? Really?

558
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:13,099
Yeah.

559
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:14,909
You have the money?

560
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:18,539
They just asked for my banking information and I gave it to them.

561
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:20,159
You did what?

562
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,530
Relax. How else was I going to get my prize money?

563
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,409
It seems really dangerous.

564
00:50:25,409 --> 00:50:29,539
You're just jealous because I won a hundred thousand money?

565
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:31,909
It's already there in my bank account.

566
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:33,599
You checked? Really?

567
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,920
Yeah. I bought this new outfit with my winnings.

568
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,159
Wow. I'm sorry for doubting you.

569
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:42,460
It's fine.

570
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,599
I guess I'll always click on those banners from now on.

571
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,099
Sounds like a plan.

572
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:52,659
Wait, what?

573
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,659
All right. So we've got to get something compelling to draw.

574
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:58,320
Real.

575
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:04,230
Real.

576
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,369
Okay.

577
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:14,579
And some internet safety lessons amuse.

578
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,260
Two million money is a small price to pay for art.

579
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,949
Allegedly cursed.

580
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:24,920
First, always give your banking information to anyone who asks for it.

581
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,920
I was...

582
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,920
Jesus.

583
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,539
No, do not do that.

584
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:32,409
Okay.

585
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:49,260
What are you up to?

586
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,260
Afternoon, detective.

587
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,809
Afternoon, detective.

588
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:54,809
What can I get for you?

589
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:56,239
Nothing for me, thanks.

590
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,239
I'm here on official business.

591
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,800
Oh, you're about the hats?

592
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,099
I must look like a heck of a suspect.

593
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:04,659
Why is that?

594
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:07,840
I'm the only resident of Cowboy County without a hat.

595
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,019
I mean, until now.

596
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:12,190
That's pretty suspicious of me.

597
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,190
I could have stolen them all out of jealousy.

598
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:18,400
And cooked them up in a stew.

599
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:24,630
Did you steal...

600
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:29,519
Did you steal the hats and cook them up in your stew?

601
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:32,170
You bet.

602
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,730
Oh.

603
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:37,739
Everyone, come get your hats stew.

604
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:42,780
I'm just pulling your leg, detective.

605
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,780
I'm a jokester.

606
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,400
They call me Bantering Bonnie around here.

607
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,329
That's a nice nickname.

608
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:52,079
I'm literally joking.

609
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:55,940
They just call me Bonnie.

610
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,139
I made that up.

611
00:52:58,139 --> 00:52:59,139
Oh.

612
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:01,340
Now you're getting it.

613
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,340
I'm full of jokes.

614
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,099
Yeah.

615
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:05,099
I get it now.

616
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,099
Um.

617
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,099
Anyway, you mentioned that you don't wear a hat.

618
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:08,099
Why not?

619
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:12,369
My head is a weird shape.

620
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:15,699
Ah.

621
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:18,139
I'm literally joking.

622
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:21,260
My head is completely normal.

623
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,260
Oh.

624
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,500
Mine too.

625
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,309
I just don't like the way hats look with my dress.

626
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:28,739
Plus, I'm inside most of the time, so why bother?

627
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,920
It's not a suspicious thing.

628
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,920
LOL.

629
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,119
Okay.

630
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:35,940
LOL.

631
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,940
Hey, detective.

632
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,989
Yeah?

633
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:42,539
I know a lot about Cowboy County.

634
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:43,539
I know it all.

635
00:53:43,539 --> 00:53:44,969
Why are we yelling?

636
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:46,400
It's a joke.

637
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,400
LOL.

638
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,019
Is it okay if I talk normally?

639
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:53,530
Yes, but it was just a joke.

640
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,340
Okay.

641
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,519
Anyway, as I was saying, my job here isn't just to run the saloon.

642
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:01,519
I'm also a keen historian for Cowboy County.

643
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,949
Despite my hilarious nature, I take the world very seriously.

644
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:11,139
For example, did you know that the graveyard up on the hill is gravely haunted?

645
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:12,139
Gravely.

646
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:13,630
Sorry?

647
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,380
Gravely haunted.

648
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,380
Gravely.

649
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,139
Graveyard.

650
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:19,500
Yeah, that's what I said.

651
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,500
I have tons of stories and photographs from the haunted hill.

652
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,639
You can check them out if you want.

653
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:25,639
I sure will.

654
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:28,739
Thanks.

655
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:29,909
LOL.

656
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:30,909
I just got the gravely thing.

657
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:36,420
Can I ask you a few questions?

658
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:44,639
You didn't actually make hat stew, did you?

659
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:45,639
Of course not.

660
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:46,880
Gross.

661
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,880
I am making stew, though.

662
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,119
It's the only way I can think to get the regular customers back.

663
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,059
Where'd they go?

664
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:57,010
Oh, they're around, but I think they got a bit scared off.

665
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,949
Do you have bandits in the saloon?

666
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:01,960
LOL.

667
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,960
I wish.

668
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,960
It's worse.

669
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,650
Artists.

670
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,079
Artists?

671
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:08,079
Creative types.

672
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,960
That doesn't sound scary at all.

673
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,019
No, but no.

674
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,260
You're right.

675
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,260
It just changes the vibe.

676
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,880
They hang around all day creating things and finding themselves.

677
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,630
I miss the rootin' tootin' cowboy bootin' times we used to have.

678
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,630
You're not a fan of art?

679
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,510
I like the cartoon section of the newspaper.

680
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:30,510
If that counts.

681
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,269
Sure.

682
00:55:33,269 --> 00:55:35,269
You just want everyone to party a bit more, right?

683
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:36,699
Right.

684
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:41,780
Get them to stop taking themselves so seriously.

685
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,539
Stew.

686
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:46,539
Cat stew.

687
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:49,190
I'm joking.

688
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:53,570
Sorry, I'm still learning about jokes.

689
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:56,570
It's just a normal stew, but I'm famous for it around here.

690
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,380
Lure them here with the stew.

691
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,380
Keep them here with the party atmosphere.

692
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,019
Sounds like a great plan.

693
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:06,019
I don't have enough ingredients, though.

694
00:56:06,019 --> 00:56:08,320
Say, could you bring me some carrots?

695
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,820
I'll give you the cash.

696
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,210
Sure.

697
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,469
Got some money.

698
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:18,889
She is not joking.

699
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:21,889
Oh, and around these parts there's really delicious edible cactus flower.

700
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:24,380
Could you collect four for me?

701
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,260
I guess so.

702
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,019
I'll give you as much stew as you want in return.

703
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,219
Sounds like a good deal.

704
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:36,130
Okay.

705
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,130
Wait, what about the ghost photos?

706
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,650
Do you know much about the photos here in the salo-

707
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:41,650
Whoa!

708
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:42,650
Acting.

709
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:47,960
Do you know much about the photos here in the saloon?

710
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,710
Legend has it they're haunted.

711
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:55,210
I don't know if I believe it, but you're welcome to take a look at them and I'll tell you what I know.

712
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,769
Sure, thanks.

713
00:56:56,769 --> 00:56:58,769
Can I ask you some questions about this case?

714
00:56:58,769 --> 00:56:59,940
Don't have any more.

715
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:08,030
Okay, so what do I do with-

716
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:16,590
I gotta look at the photos?

717
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:27,510
Hearing your actual voice is so jarring.

718
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:34,420
Audio book Andy.

719
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,730
Okay, so let's- I mean, we've got some tasks.

720
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:45,619
This one is standing in front of a graveyard that's totally haunted behavior.

721
00:57:45,619 --> 00:57:47,500
Maybe she's mourning.

722
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,500
Did you ever think of that?

723
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,179
Then why is she smiling?

724
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:53,699
Yeah, good point.

725
00:57:53,699 --> 00:57:55,699
Actually, I know who that is.

726
00:57:55,699 --> 00:57:59,940
That's Betsy, one of the first shop owners here in Cowboy County.

727
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,179
She sold all these gravestones to residents of the town.

728
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,179
I suspect that's why she has such a big smile on her face.

729
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:09,260
Smile of a clever businesswoman.

730
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,940
Not haunted.

731
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,440
Not haunted, okay, thanks.

732
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,090
Okay.

733
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:22,829
Is this a ghost?

734
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:24,650
Who, Mark?

735
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:28,039
Ha ha ha ha!

736
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:30,280
No, I wish Mark was a ghost.

737
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,159
What?

738
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,039
That didn't come out right, lol.

739
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:37,789
Oh, that's my ex-husband.

740
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:39,670
Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.

741
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,420
Why did you get divorced?

742
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,119
Seems like a pretty personal question.

743
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:48,639
My bad.

744
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:50,010
Ha ha ha!

745
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,010
I'm just kidding.

746
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,010
He's not really my ex-husband.

747
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:55,010
I actually don't know who that is, but I called him Mark.

748
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,010
I think that photo is over 50 years old.

749
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:01,269
Take my word for it though, that's not a haunted photo.

750
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:02,269
It has nice energy.

751
00:59:02,269 --> 00:59:03,269
Okay.

752
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:05,409
What?

753
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:14,309
This one's super spooky.

754
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:16,309
Surely it has to be a ghost photo.

755
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:19,059
That's old Snappy Fresh.

756
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:23,059
He was one of the original gold miners here in town about 100 years ago.

757
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,940
Wow.

758
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,380
It's so old and creepy.

759
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,679
It totally fits the description I'm looking for.

760
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:32,429
Yeah, well, you're out of luck.

761
00:59:32,429 --> 00:59:34,250
Oh.

762
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:36,739
Old Snappy Fresh is still alive.

763
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:37,920
How could he be a ghost?

764
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,800
He's still alive?

765
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,800
How old is he?

766
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,550
It's impolite to ask an old person's age.

767
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,050
He's 130 years old.

768
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,059
How do you know?

769
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:50,550
I asked.

770
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,550
Coincidentally, that's how I learned it was rude to ask someone's age.

771
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,500
Oh, okay.

772
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Thanks.

773
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:04,059
Do I have to decide which one is haunted or maybe she'll just tell me eventually?

774
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:08,570
Oh, I like this one.

775
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:09,570
I hope it's not haunted.

776
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:11,320
Bad luck, detective.

777
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,500
This is the most haunted photo of all.

778
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,179
Why?

779
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,619
Legend has it this rabbit was a real mean guy.

780
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:25,500
He would put banana peels out for people to trip on, give people wedgies, you name it.

781
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,500
That's horrible.

782
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,679
Yeah.

783
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:29,980
Wait.

784
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,159
Sorry.

785
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:32,340
I'm thinking of someone else.

786
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,340
How embarrassing.

787
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,340
No.

788
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,340
This guy was the sheriff about 80 years ago.

789
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,409
A great sheriff loved by all.

790
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:40,710
They're not haunted.

791
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,340
Nope.

792
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,650
Sorry.

793
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,650
All good.

794
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:54,650
She's literally joking.

795
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,659
Is this a ghost?

796
01:00:56,659 --> 01:00:57,659
I doubt it.

797
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:01,329
That's a photo of a visitor from about a year ago.

798
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:04,329
They came in and changed all the colors in Cowboy County.

799
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:05,329
Really weird and messy.

800
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:08,409
Fun though.

801
01:01:08,409 --> 01:01:09,409
And they're still alive.

802
01:01:09,409 --> 01:01:11,219
I sure hope so.

803
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:12,980
Thanks.

804
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,750
Huh.

805
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,500
Wait a minute.

806
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,090
What's going on here?

807
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:42,820
Is it?

808
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:50,780
I think we found the ghost.

809
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:55,599
What about this one?

810
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,949
Wait.

811
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:00,130
Was this one here before?

812
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:01,130
Hmm.

813
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,889
I don't remember.

814
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:07,059
There's such a strange energy to it.

815
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:08,429
Yeah.

816
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:10,429
I suddenly feel really chilly when I look at it.

817
01:02:10,429 --> 01:02:13,250
He's handsome yet cold.

818
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,579
Like he's seen too much.

819
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,579
A man who has lived a thousand lives.

820
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:21,139
There's a kindness to him.

821
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:24,400
But also a great mystery.

822
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
Bonnie?

823
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,699
Yes, detective.

824
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:29,010
I think this is a haunted photo.

825
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,760
I think you might well be right.

826
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,320
May I take it?

827
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,880
Please do.

828
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,880
I'll be glad to be rid of it.

829
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,760
All right.

830
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,320
We got the photo.

831
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,320
Sick.

832
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,320
Got the photo.

833
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:46,659
Sick.

834
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:47,659
Okay.

835
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:54,019
So who wanted the ghost picture?

836
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:55,019
Fake ID.

837
01:02:55,019 --> 01:02:57,090
Oh, it was you.

838
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:58,090
Okay.

839
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:59,090
Proof of a ghost.

840
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:00,090
Craig.

841
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:06,050
Very nice.

842
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:07,050
All right.

843
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:15,900
Look what I got.

844
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:22,500
Can I ask you some questions?

845
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,739
Here's the ghost pic.

846
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:31,070
So I took a look at all the photos in the saloon, and I think this one is definitely a ghost.

847
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:32,070
Oh, really?

848
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:33,070
How do you know?

849
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,889
Bonnie helped me out by telling me the stories of all the photos.

850
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:41,059
The rest of the photos seem pretty normal, but this one is something else.

851
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:43,559
I can just tell.

852
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:45,559
The energy from this photo is very spooky and suspicious.

853
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:49,250
I should have known right away, but I suppose I can only be so smart.

854
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,880
I suppose that's true.

855
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
Is it okay if I take a photocopy of this?

856
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,760
That's fine.

857
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,260
Hopefully this is enough proof for the Ghost Spotters League to finally let me in.

858
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,329
If they don't, it's their loss.

859
01:04:03,329 --> 01:04:04,699
Thanks.

860
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:08,369
Hey, can I give you something for all your help?

861
01:04:08,369 --> 01:04:10,119
What do you have?

862
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:11,679
A pickaxe.

863
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:14,139
Why?

864
01:04:14,139 --> 01:04:15,760
Sorry?

865
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,539
Why do you have a pickaxe?

866
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:19,539
What's it to you?

867
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:24,300
Can't I just carry around a pickaxe?

868
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,659
Is there something wrong with that?

869
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:28,989
No, I guess not.

870
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:33,230
But usually when people give stuff to me, they have some reason for having it in the first place.

871
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:36,300
Do people give stuff to you often?

872
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,059
Yeah, pretty often.

873
01:04:38,059 --> 01:04:39,059
Okay.

874
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:42,619
Well, I don't really have an explanation for the pickaxe thing.

875
01:04:42,619 --> 01:04:43,619
Sorry.

876
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,500
That's okay, I guess.

877
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,570
Just one more mystery that will haunt me for the rest of my days.

878
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:52,260
That seems really intense.

879
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,260
It's just a pickaxe.

880
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,940
For you, maybe.

881
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,630
Whatever.

882
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,000
Thanks for the pickaxe.

883
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,420
Progress.

884
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:06,690
Progress.

885
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:14,329
Okay.

886
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:15,500
So what do I do with the pickaxe?

887
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:22,309
Progress.

888
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:24,769
All right.

889
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:25,769
So wait.

890
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:26,769
Should I get that flower?

891
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:28,199
Can I even get...

892
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:29,199
Wait, can I get the flower with the pickaxe?

893
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:38,380
Where was that flower?

894
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:56,059
All right.

895
01:05:56,059 --> 01:05:57,059
Wait.

896
01:05:57,059 --> 01:06:08,590
Okay.

897
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:17,130
That's a good view.

898
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:27,260
Can I not get up there?

899
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:32,539
Just checking.

900
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:33,539
Do I do anything with the snakes?

901
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:46,130
I want to see the scorpion.

902
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:48,389
Cool.

903
01:06:48,389 --> 01:06:51,170
Cool.

904
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:52,170
Very cool.

905
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,170
It's a small scorpion.

906
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:54,730
Ooh.

907
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:55,730
Look, look, look, look, look.

908
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:57,099
Is it...

909
01:06:57,099 --> 01:07:01,980
Can I jump?

910
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:02,980
Okay.

911
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:03,980
That's one prickly cactus.

912
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:04,980
Good thing I have these gloves.

913
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:05,980
Ooh.

914
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,079
All right.

915
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:17,039
So this one.

916
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,780
I need to get a couple more.

917
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:21,780
The other one was back here.

918
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:32,099
Wasn't it?

919
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:33,099
Where was the other one?

920
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:35,300
Oh, it's over here.

921
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,780
You missed it?

922
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:44,820
I did?

923
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:45,820
Next to the entrance.

924
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:46,820
You goofy streamer.

925
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,980
Past it?

926
01:07:49,980 --> 01:08:01,289
And the other one's back behind there.

927
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:03,940
Goofy streamer.

928
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,059
I mean, I...

929
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:13,659
That's true.

930
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:14,659
Okay.

931
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:15,659
And the last one...

932
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:16,659
Is there only four?

933
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:17,659
Or is there more than four?

934
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:20,239
I don't know.

935
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:31,380
Four.

936
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,380
That should be enough flowers.

937
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:35,930
All right.

938
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:45,119
We are getting very close to talk about and show Grotto Beasts.

939
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:54,829
We are moments away, I would say.

940
01:08:54,829 --> 01:08:56,170
We haven't heard Bernie yet.

941
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:58,560
You can't.

942
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,560
Hold on.

943
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,560
Hold on.

944
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,779
Hold on a little bit.

945
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:04,779
Okay.

946
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:06,149
Let...

947
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:07,970
This is...

948
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:08,970
So, this...

949
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:09,970
Okay.

950
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:12,229
Oh.

951
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:13,600
Wow.

952
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,939
Look at you.

953
01:09:16,939 --> 01:09:17,939
Huh?

954
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:18,939
Your jumper.

955
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:20,300
Your vacant smile.

956
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,800
Those piercing eyes.

957
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,220
Are you a model by any chance?

958
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,500
I certainly am not.

959
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,989
Maybe it's time to start modeling.

960
01:09:31,989 --> 01:09:33,489
Maybe.

961
01:09:33,489 --> 01:09:38,529
Maybe it's time to solve a mystery.

962
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:41,130
That does not sound like that person I'm trying to do.

963
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:43,899
But yeah.

964
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:48,689
Actually, I don't know what you mean.

965
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:49,689
I'm a detective.

966
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:52,319
Ah.

967
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,420
Is there a problem?

968
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:55,420
I don't want any trouble.

969
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:58,180
I'm an outlaw, you see.

970
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,539
My name is Sherman.

971
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:04,899
Authority and I don't always see eye to eye.

972
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:07,819
I have no authority at all.

973
01:10:07,819 --> 01:10:15,359
You have the authority to steal my heart.

974
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:16,359
Because of your good looks.

975
01:10:16,359 --> 01:10:19,949
Yeah.

976
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,699
It's just a little joke.

977
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:23,699
Not about your looks.

978
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:25,380
You look great.

979
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:30,869
It was like you could like steal my heart because you're so dashing.

980
01:10:30,869 --> 01:10:31,869
Yeah.

981
01:10:31,869 --> 01:10:32,869
You're too kind.

982
01:10:32,869 --> 01:10:34,500
Anyway.

983
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:37,930
How can I help you, detective?

984
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:40,270
I'm here about the missing hats.

985
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,270
The missing hearts?

986
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:45,420
You've stolen them.

987
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,420
Sorry.

988
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,420
Just joking.

989
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,619
Maybe not the time for my killer sense of humor.

990
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:50,619
The hats.

991
01:10:50,619 --> 01:10:51,619
Right.

992
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:52,619
Of course.

993
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:53,619
The hats.

994
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:54,619
Mine was stolen.

995
01:10:54,619 --> 01:10:56,689
Do you have any leads?

996
01:10:56,689 --> 01:10:57,689
Who doesn't?

997
01:10:57,689 --> 01:10:58,689
That's what I'm here to figure out.

998
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:01,600
Did you see anything suspicious over the last couple of days?

999
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,460
I looked in a mirror.

1000
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:09,029
I'm suspicious looking because I'm an outlaw.

1001
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:11,229
Oh.

1002
01:11:11,229 --> 01:11:13,050
Hmm.

1003
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:17,930
Honestly, I'm a bit confused on how this new sheriff came into the picture.

1004
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:22,949
My fellow outlaw, Rhonda Dynamite, was working up the courage to ask to be the new sheriff.

1005
01:11:22,949 --> 01:11:27,869
Clearly, she did not get the courage in time because this new guy, Mason Mole, wanted in

1006
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:28,869
like he owns the place.

1007
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:31,390
You don't like him?

1008
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:33,340
Oh, don't get me wrong.

1009
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:34,340
He's okay.

1010
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:37,619
I just don't know why he wants to be the sheriff.

1011
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:40,220
Cowboy County has always been a lawless land.

1012
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:43,100
That's the way we like it.

1013
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:46,460
Everybody respects and understands each other here, so I thought it would be better if the

1014
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,460
sheriff was one of us.

1015
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:52,890
I'm not saying he'll do a bad job or anything, but I just hope he keeps the county as kind

1016
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:55,979
as it ever was.

1017
01:11:55,979 --> 01:12:04,750
You're turning into Christopher Walken, am I?

1018
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,739
Have you spoken to him much?

1019
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:10,619
He's barely said two- No, that's not Walken.

1020
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:12,569
Come on.

1021
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:14,869
He's barely said two words the whole time he's been here.

1022
01:12:14,869 --> 01:12:16,409
I assume he's shy.

1023
01:12:16,409 --> 01:12:17,930
So I'll give him the time to settle in.

1024
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,619
But I don't know.

1025
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:24,789
It can't be strange when someone new comes into your community.

1026
01:12:24,789 --> 01:12:27,750
I really want to be as welcoming as possible, but I have a few concerns.

1027
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:30,729
Can I ask you some questions about the case?

1028
01:12:30,729 --> 01:12:35,810
We got the pickaxe.

1029
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,619
Please do Walken.

1030
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,630
No.

1031
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,470
I have talked about this before.

1032
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:50,039
You cannot do a Walken unless you can absolutely do a Christopher Walken.

1033
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:51,979
There is no attempting to do a Walken.

1034
01:12:51,979 --> 01:12:57,720
You either do it and nail it or not at all.

1035
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:01,460
The people that can do Walken, they do it phenomenally.

1036
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,619
Everybody else kind of, wow, it just goes like, no, no, no, no, no.

1037
01:13:05,619 --> 01:13:10,529
You don't attempt a Walken unless you do a Walken.

1038
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:11,729
You know what I'm saying?

1039
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:16,090
You do not do that.

1040
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,890
Any reason why you're hanging out by the mines?

1041
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:22,420
Well, yeah, I heard there's gold in there.

1042
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,920
Wow.

1043
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,930
I really like gold.

1044
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:30,380
I don't mean to sound insensitive, but I want to ask, is it a thing for sloths to like

1045
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,869
gold?

1046
01:13:31,869 --> 01:13:33,689
Why do you ask?

1047
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:36,010
My friend Martin is a sloth and he loves gold.

1048
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:38,430
He made a crown out of it.

1049
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:39,800
Sounds heavy.

1050
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,359
Yeah.

1051
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,159
Well, I haven't really thought about it before, but yes, I think sloths do like gold.

1052
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,159
But then again, who doesn't?

1053
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:49,909
I find it doesn't suit my complexion.

1054
01:13:49,909 --> 01:13:51,949
I think anything would suit your complexion.

1055
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:57,699
But anyway, I'm trying to get into the mine, but it's all blocked up.

1056
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:02,020
Dang, have you tried exploding it with a tiny bit of burp?

1057
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,539
Mate?

1058
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:06,739
What?

1059
01:14:06,739 --> 01:14:07,739
That sounds really dangerous.

1060
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:12,119
I was thinking more along the lines of a pickaxe.

1061
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:13,920
Oh, that was gross.

1062
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,920
Oh, whatever.

1063
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:18,170
Oh, that would probably be better, yeah.

1064
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:19,170
Do you have one?

1065
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,170
I can trade you for a shovel?

1066
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,979
I'll think about it.

1067
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:25,859
Do you mind if I ask you some questions about the case?

1068
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:32,250
Should we get info first?

1069
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:35,260
Why are you so suspicious of Mason Moe?

1070
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,260
It's not like me to be suspicious, really.

1071
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,520
You know me.

1072
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:43,329
Not yet.

1073
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:47,210
Anyway, I just really don't understand his motives.

1074
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:50,149
Why is he here?

1075
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:51,149
I'm not so sure.

1076
01:14:51,149 --> 01:14:57,270
Obviously, I want to trust lobster cop's judgment, but this new guy is quiet and shady.

1077
01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:00,279
Do you even know what job he did before this?

1078
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:01,279
I have no idea.

1079
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:02,779
Do you know?

1080
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:04,140
No.

1081
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,510
Figures.

1082
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:08,289
Do you mind if I ask you some questions?

1083
01:15:08,289 --> 01:15:12,260
Well, let's complete it right here.

1084
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:14,880
You mentioned you wanted a pickaxe, right?

1085
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,569
Sure did.

1086
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:18,569
I have one here if you'd be willing to trade it for the shovel.

1087
01:15:18,569 --> 01:15:20,189
Oh, I'd love that.

1088
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:21,369
Thanks.

1089
01:15:21,369 --> 01:15:23,369
I could also trade for a nice dinner.

1090
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:24,609
Just you and I.

1091
01:15:24,609 --> 01:15:27,550
I'll take the shovel for now.

1092
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:29,500
The offer's open.

1093
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,060
Maybe after I've solved the case.

1094
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,810
Okay.

1095
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:41,899
Alright, there you go.

1096
01:15:41,899 --> 01:15:42,899
I did Bernie.

1097
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:44,899
I did my terrible Bernie impression.

1098
01:15:44,899 --> 01:15:52,319
Alright, are you guys ready?

1099
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:53,319
Are you guys ready to go over this?

1100
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:55,689
This has been like two years coming.

1101
01:15:55,689 --> 01:15:58,760
Are you ready to talk about this for a little bit?

1102
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:03,579
We'll come back.

1103
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:04,579
We'll finish this tonight.

1104
01:16:04,579 --> 01:16:06,579
We'll just want to take a little bit of time to go over it.

1105
01:16:06,579 --> 01:16:12,880
I don't know.

1106
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,880
I found it difficult to pay attention.

1107
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,880
Those eyes.

1108
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,770
Pickaxe to break into the mine.

1109
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:19,770
Okay, so I got a shovel.

1110
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:23,539
Alright, I am going to take a quick BRB.

1111
01:16:23,539 --> 01:16:25,539
When I come back, we're going to go over grotto beasts.

1112
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:28,420
Those of you that are asking, what is that?

1113
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,789
You will see very shortly.

1114
01:16:30,789 --> 01:16:35,449
So, here we go.

1115
01:16:35,449 --> 01:16:36,449
I will be right back.

1116
01:16:36,449 --> 01:19:36,229
Alrighty.

1117
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:39,329
Hello.

1118
01:19:39,329 --> 01:19:40,329
Are we ready to look at this?

1119
01:19:40,329 --> 01:19:49,289
Hold on, let me just say something.

1120
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:56,109
Yeah, we're kind of corroborating when the store is going to go up.

1121
01:19:56,109 --> 01:19:58,800
So, give us just a second or two.

1122
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:04,750
Alright, ladies and gentlemen.

1123
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:10,600
It's time.

1124
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,739
You've waited long enough.

1125
01:20:12,739 --> 01:20:22,869
Okay, hold on.

1126
01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:23,869
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1127
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:28,180
Alright, here we go.

1128
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:30,810
Let's go over grotto beasts.

1129
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:31,810
Are you ready?

1130
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:34,260
I hope so.

1131
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:38,539
So, for those that have no idea what's going on.

1132
01:20:38,539 --> 01:20:45,149
A couple of years ago, we did a stream called The Wonders of Archaeology.

1133
01:20:45,149 --> 01:20:53,979
In that stream, I opened up card packs from a game, a fake game that we made up.

1134
01:20:53,979 --> 01:21:03,380
And a couple of years later, I am pleased to announce to you that as of tonight,

1135
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:10,659
free sales are open and you can actually get the real thing.

1136
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:14,699
Aw, dude, Elden Ring!

1137
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:15,699
No, it's not Elden Ring.

1138
01:21:15,699 --> 01:21:18,220
So, let's go.

1139
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:20,460
Are you ready for the presentation?

1140
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,399
Here comes the presentation.

1141
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:32,130
I'm just going to go through this.

1142
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,130
I'm going to read.

1143
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:35,130
There's a lot of stuff to read.

1144
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,430
So, just be aware.

1145
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:39,800
This is going to be like a presentation stream.

1146
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,680
So, what is it?

1147
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:47,050
It's a physical trading card game where you and your opponents compete in a rumble to determine a champion.

1148
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:51,609
Harness new summoning powers to call upon grottoes, beasts, wishes.

1149
01:21:51,609 --> 01:21:54,909
You may even tag a powerful challenger to add even more crazy effects.

1150
01:21:54,909 --> 01:22:02,609
So, again, like I just said, the lore of this whole thing is back, it was March 6, 2021.

1151
01:22:02,609 --> 01:22:08,199
That stream kind of sparked this idea.

1152
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:10,630
So, like, what if we, the original idea was we were going to,

1153
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:18,300
oh, what if we just, like, release the 40, original 40 beasts and just put them in card packs and whatever.

1154
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,380
Who cares?

1155
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:23,550
It kind of evolved into where it is now.

1156
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:25,920
And it's evolved many times.

1157
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:31,510
Again, it's March 6 in a week.

1158
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:37,500
So, kind of good timing here because that's the two-year anniversary of that stream.

1159
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,010
We went into the desert, did all the digging, did all the stuff with the excavator.

1160
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,010
It was really fun.

1161
01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:47,170
So, that is kind of what this project is.

1162
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,340
That's where it started.

1163
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:55,239
But going forward here, it's a real game.

1164
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:57,479
It's a real card game.

1165
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:02,859
A designer was hired to put this all together.

1166
01:23:02,859 --> 01:23:05,819
It plays.

1167
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:09,390
It's a 1v1.

1168
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:10,390
The game is a 1v1.

1169
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:13,390
I think there's another game mode as well.

1170
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:18,699
But this is not just, oh, it's, like, collectible cards.

1171
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:22,020
It's also this big game.

1172
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:25,699
Now people are probably asking, oh, that's kind of cool, man.

1173
01:23:25,699 --> 01:23:30,199
But, like, playing a game or collecting cards to make, like, a big deck.

1174
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:35,130
The whole purpose of this project is for it to be community merch.

1175
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:37,689
I'll address it a little bit later.

1176
01:23:37,689 --> 01:23:44,819
But the number one thing that I care about here is people being able just to do this for fun.

1177
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:49,020
But there's an unbelievably cool game that's behind the whole thing.

1178
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:52,689
So, they are standard playing card sizes.

1179
01:23:52,689 --> 01:23:55,859
We've seen that question a million times.

1180
01:23:55,859 --> 01:23:58,859
Hey, can they fit into the sleeves?

1181
01:23:58,859 --> 01:23:59,859
Yes.

1182
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:01,859
Standard playing card size.

1183
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:02,859
Three and a half by two and a half.

1184
01:24:02,859 --> 01:24:04,420
There are rarities.

1185
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:07,289
Common and rare.

1186
01:24:07,289 --> 01:24:09,659
As you can see, they have a C or an R above the card number.

1187
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:12,659
There are holographic versions of every card.

1188
01:24:12,659 --> 01:24:14,899
Every single card has a holographic version.

1189
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:19,909
And there are, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong,

1190
01:24:19,909 --> 01:24:23,909
Grotto Beasts group chat because they're probably going to scream at me if I say this wrong.

1191
01:24:23,909 --> 01:24:27,789
There are four different holographic types.

1192
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:33,060
Is that correct, right?

1193
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,989
Yes.

1194
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:37,989
Okay, good. Four, yes.

1195
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:41,619
So there are 200 different cards.

1196
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:44,109
200 individual pieces of artwork.

1197
01:24:44,109 --> 01:24:50,100
I think the Grotto Beasts team has shown 150.

1198
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:54,140
So also the original 40 are there as well.

1199
01:24:54,140 --> 01:25:00,149
There were 20 artists that came together to do this.

1200
01:25:00,149 --> 01:25:09,420
All the original 40 that featured in the stream plus 16 additional guest illustrators from the community were recruited.

1201
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,420
One being me.

1202
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:13,840
We revealed the card that I did last week, two weeks ago.

1203
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:14,840
One guy.

1204
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,529
And I think it's a phenomenal piece of artwork.

1205
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:24,270
But hold on, I got a burp again.

1206
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:26,859
Yeah.

1207
01:25:26,859 --> 01:25:30,340
There are four different card types.

1208
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,340
There are wish cards.

1209
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,340
Actually, this might be on the next page.

1210
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:36,340
And by the way, this is all going to be available.

1211
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:42,829
This FAQ here, it will be available as of probably tomorrow morning.

1212
01:25:42,829 --> 01:25:44,829
But I wanted to show it on stream first.

1213
01:25:44,829 --> 01:25:48,829
So this resource will be very easy for you to go look if you're like, wait, what the hell is he?

1214
01:25:48,829 --> 01:25:49,829
What did he say about this?

1215
01:25:49,829 --> 01:25:54,140
Four different cards, card types.

1216
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:56,829
And a lot went into it, as you can see.

1217
01:25:56,829 --> 01:25:57,829
Here's the, all right, here we go, here we go.

1218
01:25:57,829 --> 01:25:58,829
Let's go.

1219
01:25:58,829 --> 01:26:00,460
Game info.

1220
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:01,460
The rules.

1221
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:04,020
Again, it's a 1v1 game.

1222
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:05,020
Two players.

1223
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:06,020
Classic dual gameplay.

1224
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:08,189
Shorter and more competitive.

1225
01:26:08,189 --> 01:26:09,189
The Rumble.

1226
01:26:09,189 --> 01:26:10,189
Two players.

1227
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:13,189
Adds challenger cards that change the way the decks interact with each other.

1228
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:15,739
Or the Derma Rumble.

1229
01:26:15,739 --> 01:26:16,739
Three plus players.

1230
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:17,739
Chaotic.

1231
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:18,739
Intense.

1232
01:26:18,739 --> 01:26:20,300
Game mode.

1233
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,300
There are three different ways to play it.

1234
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:25,989
A deck, you make a deck, by the way.

1235
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:29,619
So all decks must contain 40 cards.

1236
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:32,619
Each deck can contain, hold on, I can't even read this right.

1237
01:26:32,619 --> 01:26:35,859
Each deck can contain up to three copies of each card that shares.

1238
01:26:35,859 --> 01:26:36,859
All right, let me ask.

1239
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:43,229
When I used to do these in school, I would be like shuffling papers.

1240
01:26:43,229 --> 01:26:48,229
So when Abraham Lincoln, what year was he fucking born?

1241
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,180
I feel like I'm shuffling papers around.

1242
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:58,500
But yeah, so each deck has to have 40 cards to play.

1243
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:03,859
Each deck can contain up to three copies of each card that shares the same card name.

1244
01:27:03,859 --> 01:27:05,859
So you can only have three in each deck.

1245
01:27:05,859 --> 01:27:07,859
You can't have like 10 of the same card.

1246
01:27:07,859 --> 01:27:12,300
They may only be one epic card type in your deck.

1247
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:16,539
But just like other cards, you may have up to three of those.

1248
01:27:16,539 --> 01:27:22,609
So there is going to be, oh, epic.

1249
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:29,710
There's going to be some media that is produced over the coming weeks to really show how this game is played.

1250
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:43,460
Our game designer is starting to put together sort of an explanation because it's the game is it's about it's kind of like I'm trying to compare it to something.

1251
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,460
What's the best thing to compare this to?

1252
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:45,460
Grotto Beast group chat.

1253
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:50,239
There will be full rules, explanations.

1254
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:55,100
This is just to tell you what it is.

1255
01:27:55,100 --> 01:28:00,649
What's the best way to describe it?

1256
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:05,960
No, it's kind.

1257
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:06,960
I can't read that.

1258
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,960
Somebody said somebody said something weird.

1259
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,329
It's kind of like Yu-Gi-Oh, a little like Magic the Gathering.

1260
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:15,949
It's it's kind of just like our design.

1261
01:28:15,949 --> 01:28:21,189
But the designer spent two years of his life on this and incredibly passionate.

1262
01:28:21,189 --> 01:28:23,189
He created a really fun, really interesting.

1263
01:28:23,189 --> 01:28:26,500
It's kind of hard to describe, but we will have all that info.

1264
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,670
You'll see exactly how the game is played.

1265
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:33,539
Or if you don't really care about playing the game, then you don't have to.

1266
01:28:33,539 --> 01:28:35,539
You can just get this if you feel like it.

1267
01:28:35,539 --> 01:28:38,760
Right. So here we go.

1268
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,760
Take a look at this.

1269
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,189
Here it is.

1270
01:28:42,189 --> 01:28:44,880
This is it right here.

1271
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:45,880
This is the box.

1272
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,380
These are the packs.

1273
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:52,069
Let's go over what you get if you actually buy this.

1274
01:28:52,069 --> 01:28:56,210
So there are foil booster packs.

1275
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:59,899
They each contain 10 cards total.

1276
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:05,069
Two of those cards are guaranteed to be one rare and one holographic.

1277
01:29:05,069 --> 01:29:08,569
Every single card pack has a holographic.

1278
01:29:08,569 --> 01:29:11,569
One holographic in every single pack.

1279
01:29:11,569 --> 01:29:16,329
We wanted to make sure that it was going to be kind of fun to open.

1280
01:29:16,329 --> 01:29:19,779
There's also the starter kit.

1281
01:29:19,779 --> 01:29:26,539
So the two player starter kit is everything you need to be able to play or just collect it if you want.

1282
01:29:26,539 --> 01:29:29,720
It's got a lot of stuff in it.

1283
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:34,720
It's got a huge rule book and I saw some, you know, 43 page rule book.

1284
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,600
It's elaborate.

1285
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,989
The game is very, very well made.

1286
01:29:39,989 --> 01:29:48,500
You get two play mats, which are here with artwork and, you know, places with some good rules and stuff and some phases.

1287
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,180
Two preset decks.

1288
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,180
You get two full decks.

1289
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,739
And I will say I have a card.

1290
01:29:54,739 --> 01:30:00,800
There is a germa card and it's in one of these decks.

1291
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,170
So if you buy the starter kit, you'll get my card.

1292
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:07,689
We want to make sure that was a thing.

1293
01:30:07,689 --> 01:30:12,500
So inside you also get not just the two full decks.

1294
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,500
You get two boosters in there as well.

1295
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,510
Two boosters?

1296
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:18,510
What an egomaniac.

1297
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:21,819
So each starter kit has two boosters in it.

1298
01:30:21,819 --> 01:30:23,630
And look at this.

1299
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:25,060
Two dice.

1300
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:27,500
These are custom dice.

1301
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,909
They have the logo.

1302
01:30:29,909 --> 01:30:30,909
The channel logo is on it.

1303
01:30:30,909 --> 01:30:37,119
So there's a pretty, there's a pretty decent amount of stuff in this box.

1304
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:40,119
In total, the two player starter kit has 104 cards.

1305
01:30:40,119 --> 01:30:45,050
Now let's go over kind of sort of what does that mean?

1306
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:48,050
There are 200 cards total, like individual different cards.

1307
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:50,609
The boosters have 10 in them.

1308
01:30:50,609 --> 01:30:52,979
And you get two preset decks.

1309
01:30:52,979 --> 01:30:57,149
Each deck I believe has 42 cards in it in this particular set.

1310
01:30:57,149 --> 01:31:00,380
That's correct, right?

1311
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:07,539
Grottobeast group chat, please help me.

1312
01:31:07,539 --> 01:31:10,680
Grottobeast group chat, please help me.

1313
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:16,609
There are 42 cards in each deck in the pre-built decks, right?

1314
01:31:16,609 --> 01:31:20,020
Yes, okay.

1315
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:22,020
I just want to make sure I don't say anything that's incorrect.

1316
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:26,060
So that's what you get in the box.

1317
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:32,220
And I'm looking at it right now and I still can't fucking believe how just crazy this is.

1318
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:40,130
Dude, you're in class shouting at the other people on the group project.

1319
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:41,130
Can you imagine?

1320
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:46,029
Throw, I got to throw everybody that worked on the project under the bus.

1321
01:31:46,029 --> 01:31:50,729
So let's keep going.

1322
01:31:50,729 --> 01:31:54,479
So yeah, you get the dice, you get the two, you get two of these by the way.

1323
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:57,720
You get two play mats, two full decks, the rule book.

1324
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,340
And each one of these has like really cool artwork on it.

1325
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:03,340
A lot of time, a lot of dedication, a lot of detail went into this.

1326
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:06,649
So the rule book itself, there's a lot of really just nice stuff in it.

1327
01:32:06,649 --> 01:32:07,649
It's really cool.

1328
01:32:07,649 --> 01:32:11,189
So we can keep going.

1329
01:32:11,189 --> 01:32:13,010
All right.

1330
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:15,010
When will the presale be?

1331
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:17,010
What's happening right now?

1332
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:18,010
What's happening?

1333
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:19,010
Ooh, did you see that?

1334
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:22,949
So presales will be up on our website today until the full release

1335
01:32:22,949 --> 01:32:25,949
to ensure those who have followed closely a chance to get their cards.

1336
01:32:25,949 --> 01:32:31,579
We are going to take presale orders because we want to make sure,

1337
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:34,890
I told you guys this, I want to say like a month or two ago,

1338
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:39,149
there's a lot of people that said that they really want to be able to get this.

1339
01:32:39,149 --> 01:32:42,520
And I don't, we didn't want to have it be a scenario where,

1340
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:46,020
oh yeah, there's only like 500 of them.

1341
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:47,020
Good luck.

1342
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,020
And then people just can't get it.

1343
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:54,409
So the idea is we want to keep a presale going for essentially,

1344
01:32:54,409 --> 01:32:58,899
we want anybody that wants to be able to get it to be able to presale, to buy it.

1345
01:32:58,899 --> 01:33:04,869
If you are interested, that's why we're going to keep a presale going for a little while.

1346
01:33:04,869 --> 01:33:09,329
So what about international shipping and scalper prevention?

1347
01:33:09,329 --> 01:33:10,329
Here's the big take.

1348
01:33:10,329 --> 01:33:13,399
I guess that kind of leads into this.

1349
01:33:13,399 --> 01:33:18,899
So yes, there will be international shipping and the fulfillment team that we're using,

1350
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:24,310
they're going to have some measures in place to prevent some of the more egregious forms

1351
01:33:24,310 --> 01:33:26,310
of people buying and scalping, right?

1352
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:28,810
But also presales are going to help with that too,

1353
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:34,859
because these are just being sold and we have a quantity

1354
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:36,859
and we're just going to continue to keep a presale open.

1355
01:33:36,859 --> 01:33:39,699
There you go.

1356
01:33:39,699 --> 01:33:41,329
All right, what about these questions?

1357
01:33:41,329 --> 01:33:44,329
Further print runs, more merch types, tournaments.

1358
01:33:44,329 --> 01:33:46,890
All right, so the game is currently in a limited print run.

1359
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:49,890
There's plenty of stock to help ensure anyone who wants the cards will be able to get them.

1360
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:54,319
So further print runs depend on if or how we run out of stock.

1361
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:57,140
And again, the potential for ideas is exciting,

1362
01:33:57,140 --> 01:34:01,060
but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves or over promise.

1363
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:04,060
I don't want to tell you guys, oh, wow, there's all this other shit that's planned.

1364
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,300
No, let's just get, let's get through this first.

1365
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:13,710
Let's do this part first before, you know, going forward.

1366
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:22,659
There's some interesting things in this part too.

1367
01:34:22,659 --> 01:34:24,659
Can I do artwork for Grotto Beasts?

1368
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,960
The project is done.

1369
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,140
So we do appreciate anybody that's reached out.

1370
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:30,140
People have reached out.

1371
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:37,279
And we are so happy and excited that people really want to,

1372
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:40,279
hey, dude, I got this, I got this, I could do this, I could do this.

1373
01:34:40,279 --> 01:34:42,579
We need to get through this sale first.

1374
01:34:42,579 --> 01:34:45,949
We really appreciate it, but the project is complete.

1375
01:34:45,949 --> 01:34:51,590
So just let us get through this period first.

1376
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:54,590
And there are 20, there are 20 artists.

1377
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:58,500
So that's like part of that too.

1378
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:59,500
And why did you not crowdfund this?

1379
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:00,500
What's wrong with you?

1380
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,489
I don't, I don't want to do that.

1381
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:07,920
I would rather be able to have, oh, hey, there was a Kickstarter project.

1382
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,920
And yeah, I kickstarted it for $500.

1383
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,920
Where's all my shit?

1384
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,920
How come it's not done?

1385
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:15,920
It's been two years.

1386
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:16,920
What's going on here?

1387
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,920
I don't want to take your money and not give you a product.

1388
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:22,609
I don't want to take your money and over-promise something and not deliver.

1389
01:35:22,609 --> 01:35:28,539
So that's why I didn't do a Kickstarter.

1390
01:35:28,539 --> 01:35:34,529
What other Jermaverse characters in Jermaverse is, you know,

1391
01:35:34,529 --> 01:35:37,470
I guess we can use that term here.

1392
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:38,470
So what characters are in the game?

1393
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:48,779
This is like 12 years of references to the channel.

1394
01:35:48,779 --> 01:35:52,470
And this is the big merch that I will ever do.

1395
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:58,250
This idea was actually something I wanted to do years and years and years ago.

1396
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:59,939
But I just didn't have the capabilities.

1397
01:35:59,939 --> 01:36:00,939
I didn't have the support network.

1398
01:36:00,939 --> 01:36:01,939
I didn't have the people.

1399
01:36:01,939 --> 01:36:04,109
I didn't have the capital.

1400
01:36:04,109 --> 01:36:07,109
I didn't have the money to be able to do something like this.

1401
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:13,109
So this, when people ask for merch, this is it.

1402
01:36:13,109 --> 01:36:14,109
This is merch.

1403
01:36:14,109 --> 01:36:21,979
And it's probably the most ridiculous merch I will ever do.

1404
01:36:21,979 --> 01:36:29,829
You're never going to see anything like this on this channel ever again.

1405
01:36:29,829 --> 01:36:36,539
So, but interestingly enough, there are some cards that reference nothing.

1406
01:36:36,539 --> 01:36:41,739
So I told you about the Mr. Green's casino stream that never happened.

1407
01:36:41,739 --> 01:36:43,739
We thought it was going to happen.

1408
01:36:43,739 --> 01:36:46,739
So there are like three or four cards in the game

1409
01:36:46,739 --> 01:36:51,180
that reference the Mr. Green's stream that didn't happen.

1410
01:36:51,180 --> 01:37:00,430
I was going to get into prosthetics and the Mr. Green's card

1411
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:05,229
is actually modeled off of like my face.

1412
01:37:05,229 --> 01:37:07,729
So we were going to, I was going to get into a costume

1413
01:37:07,729 --> 01:37:09,729
and I was going to do all this stuff and we have all these references

1414
01:37:09,729 --> 01:37:10,729
and it never happened.

1415
01:37:10,729 --> 01:37:13,590
So secret.

1416
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:16,579
Bring it back.

1417
01:37:16,579 --> 01:37:18,340
I don't think so.

1418
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:19,340
That's not going to happen.

1419
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,340
There are no plans to do that.

1420
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:24,140
Why is it canceled?

1421
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:29,689
Well, it just was, it just was too much.

1422
01:37:29,689 --> 01:37:30,689
It was too hard.

1423
01:37:30,689 --> 01:37:31,689
Too much going on.

1424
01:37:31,689 --> 01:37:35,140
But yeah, let's go over now.

1425
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,140
Excuse me.

1426
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:38,140
Let's talk about this really quickly.

1427
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:40,380
No, it's not an NFT project.

1428
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:41,939
This is not an NFT.

1429
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:44,939
This is physical cards, standard card size.

1430
01:37:44,939 --> 01:37:49,739
And they come in a box or they come in an oil pack.

1431
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,430
And that's it.

1432
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:53,430
It's not an NFT.

1433
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:56,590
What about a wiki?

1434
01:37:56,590 --> 01:38:01,729
We are planning on hosting and curing an official wiki for the project.

1435
01:38:01,729 --> 01:38:04,350
Lots of which will be intentionally left obscured.

1436
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,720
So there's still lots to discover as the game releases.

1437
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:11,090
We'll be populating with extra details like developers' notes and concepts

1438
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:13,090
and more world building as we go along.

1439
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:15,819
So there will be an official wiki.

1440
01:38:15,819 --> 01:38:19,819
There will be, this is going to be a project that over the coming couple of weeks

1441
01:38:19,819 --> 01:38:25,739
you'll see a lot more detail on how it's going to play out

1442
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:28,739
and when shipping is going to happen.

1443
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:31,739
Let us get through this pre-sale first.

1444
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:36,220
Can you eat the Grotto Beast cards?

1445
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:37,579
Are they flavored?

1446
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:38,579
Please do not eat the cards.

1447
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:41,760
They're not edible and they would probably taste very bad.

1448
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,319
Concerningly, this is one of the most frequently asked questions.

1449
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:47,779
Do not eat them.

1450
01:38:47,779 --> 01:38:49,779
I know a lot of people have a ton of questions.

1451
01:38:49,779 --> 01:38:53,779
A lot of people have so many questions and I would love to answer them all.

1452
01:38:53,779 --> 01:39:00,180
Let's start here and let's get to the most important part that everyone's asking.

1453
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:03,250
How much does this shit cost?

1454
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:09,390
Should we go over this first?

1455
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:15,260
Hold on, wait, what happened? Did I skip that page?

1456
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:20,979
Did I skip a page? Did I?

1457
01:39:20,979 --> 01:39:21,979
I didn't skip a page, right?

1458
01:39:21,979 --> 01:39:25,590
No, I didn't.

1459
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:31,460
All right, let's talk about price because I know a lot of people are going to say,

1460
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:33,020
how much is this shit?

1461
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:40,350
So that starter kit, I told you guys a few weeks ago,

1462
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:48,289
I so badly wanted to keep it under $100 and it's a limited run product.

1463
01:39:48,289 --> 01:39:52,090
We had to contact a manufacturing company.

1464
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:54,649
We only have a limited supply.

1465
01:39:54,649 --> 01:39:59,270
So we tried to keep the price as low as we could

1466
01:39:59,270 --> 01:40:02,270
and still be able to, you know, sell a certain amount

1467
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:05,270
and be able to at least try to make back the project money

1468
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:07,270
and try to make a little bit of money doing it, right?

1469
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:08,770
I'll be honest.

1470
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:13,250
So it's not $100, which is expensive and I know it's expensive.

1471
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:17,550
And I know that a lot of people are going to see what this actually costs

1472
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:21,539
and they're going to say, how much is it?

1473
01:40:21,539 --> 01:40:24,539
Is it $90? It's not $90, it's $79.99.

1474
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:27,300
It's $80 for the starter kit.

1475
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,729
And in the starter kit, you get the two booster packs.

1476
01:40:29,729 --> 01:40:32,729
The booster packs are going for $9.99, $10.

1477
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:37,300
And the issue that I've had, that I've always had,

1478
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:39,789
was trying to make it so...

1479
01:40:39,789 --> 01:40:45,380
I just didn't want it to be so unbelievably egregious,

1480
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:53,630
but I don't know, it's a really tough thing to do.

1481
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:56,630
But I did promise you guys that I was going to keep that starter kit under $100

1482
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:59,819
and it turns out it's $79.99.

1483
01:40:59,819 --> 01:41:06,189
But if you want to go back and kind of see exactly what you get in that box,

1484
01:41:06,189 --> 01:41:09,010
we wanted to make value.

1485
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:11,949
We wanted there to be value in it.

1486
01:41:11,949 --> 01:41:13,949
Oh no, let's put two custom dice in it.

1487
01:41:13,949 --> 01:41:15,949
That sounds fun. Throw that in there.

1488
01:41:15,949 --> 01:41:19,380
How's the box? Does the box have a good quality?

1489
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:23,140
Yeah, let's try to make the box a little bit nicer.

1490
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:37,550
So there's been a lot of soul-searching on how to actually make this have some value to it.

1491
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:43,899
So as we go forward...

1492
01:41:43,899 --> 01:41:44,899
What did you say?

1493
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:47,520
I know people are going to have a ton of questions.

1494
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,210
But how long the presale is going for?

1495
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:52,899
That's a really good question.

1496
01:41:52,899 --> 01:42:01,270
The presale is going for at least the foreseeable future.

1497
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:06,409
We need to see how many people actually are buying it or how many people actually want it.

1498
01:42:06,409 --> 01:42:09,409
And if you don't want it, if it's something that you're not really that interested in,

1499
01:42:09,409 --> 01:42:11,409
if it's like, oh no, sorry, dude, no, no, no, thanks,

1500
01:42:11,409 --> 01:42:17,619
then let's fucking hang out and play Frog Detective, right?

1501
01:42:17,619 --> 01:42:23,890
But just know that this is a project that is kind of like 12 years in the making.

1502
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:28,539
I wanted to make sure it was high quality. I wanted to make sure it was fun.

1503
01:42:28,539 --> 01:42:33,220
And hopefully you guys enjoy it because the team put a lot of time into it.

1504
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:36,680
And if you want to see who those people are...

1505
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:39,680
This is just a little letter that the team wanted to put together.

1506
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:48,180
Here's the people that worked on it.

1507
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:50,180
Not a huge team.

1508
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:52,180
It's a very small team.

1509
01:42:52,180 --> 01:43:01,439
But I feel like it's...

1510
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:03,439
I'm so glad to be able to even talk about this.

1511
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:06,439
Because people have said, dude, when are you going to be able to talk about this?

1512
01:43:06,439 --> 01:43:08,939
When the hell is this happening?

1513
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:09,939
You can't give us any info?

1514
01:43:09,939 --> 01:43:11,939
I didn't want to give you guys wrong info.

1515
01:43:11,939 --> 01:43:17,460
I didn't want to give you info that was incorrect.

1516
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:24,439
But let me just go back real quickly.

1517
01:43:24,439 --> 01:43:27,439
Because I want to be able to see what is in the box.

1518
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:30,979
Let's go back.

1519
01:43:30,979 --> 01:43:33,760
Here we go. Okay.

1520
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:41,699
So this is what is inside of that kit.

1521
01:43:41,699 --> 01:43:49,310
When is the pre-sales going to end?

1522
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:57,060
Again, that's a question that we need to see just how this goes.

1523
01:43:57,060 --> 01:44:01,060
Because I want to make sure that anybody that wants it has an opportunity to get it.

1524
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:07,060
I don't want to end pre-sales before enough people have shown interest in getting it.

1525
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:09,060
Because I don't want to end it too early.

1526
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:16,539
I also don't want to end it too late either.

1527
01:44:16,539 --> 01:44:18,539
43 pages. Yeah, it's a read.

1528
01:44:18,539 --> 01:44:21,680
We've got some time on a Sunday afternoon.

1529
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,680
Have I played it? I have played it.

1530
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:25,430
It was very fun.

1531
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:33,020
It's going to be at least a week or two in pre-sale.

1532
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:35,020
Just got the starter pack from my fiance.

1533
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:36,020
So excited.

1534
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:37,020
I hope you like it.

1535
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:38,020
I really do.

1536
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:41,520
Anytime talking about merch, you guys know me.

1537
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,520
I'm not a fucking merch person.

1538
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,270
I'm not.

1539
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:48,340
So this whole process has been really...

1540
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:49,340
I hope you like it.

1541
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,779
A lot of work went into it.

1542
01:44:51,779 --> 01:44:54,300
I hope you enjoy it.

1543
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,539
You can afford it if you can't.

1544
01:44:56,539 --> 01:44:58,539
There's other stuff that's going to be on the site.

1545
01:44:58,539 --> 01:45:00,840
We have posters.

1546
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:01,840
We have...

1547
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,840
I think you can get a four pack of cards.

1548
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,840
You can get individual card packs.

1549
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,079
There's merchandise.

1550
01:45:07,079 --> 01:45:08,079
There's clothing.

1551
01:45:08,079 --> 01:45:13,399
So I just wanted a bunch of options for people.

1552
01:45:13,399 --> 01:45:14,399
I can show the website too.

1553
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:15,399
Let's actually go to it.

1554
01:45:15,399 --> 01:45:16,399
Hold on.

1555
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:20,840
Let me show it.

1556
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:36,159
And that is grottobeasts.net.

1557
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:39,699
Let's show it.

1558
01:45:39,699 --> 01:45:40,699
Can you see?

1559
01:45:40,699 --> 01:45:43,100
You cannot see.

1560
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:50,710
You will in a second.

1561
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:54,689
Okay.

1562
01:45:54,689 --> 01:45:56,689
Let's open this back up.

1563
01:45:56,689 --> 01:46:01,319
Why is it not capturing?

1564
01:46:01,319 --> 01:46:02,319
Capture.

1565
01:46:02,319 --> 01:46:03,319
I have to show them the site.

1566
01:46:03,319 --> 01:46:09,380
I have to show it to them before I get in trouble.

1567
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:11,579
Is that working?

1568
01:46:11,579 --> 01:46:12,579
Hold on.

1569
01:46:12,579 --> 01:46:13,579
Technical difficulties.

1570
01:46:13,579 --> 01:46:17,569
Hold on.

1571
01:46:17,569 --> 01:46:18,569
Okay.

1572
01:46:18,569 --> 01:46:29,539
Now you should be able to see it.

1573
01:46:29,539 --> 01:46:30,899
All right.

1574
01:46:30,899 --> 01:46:31,899
Here we go.

1575
01:46:31,899 --> 01:46:40,760
Let's show the site.

1576
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,579
Hey.

1577
01:46:42,579 --> 01:46:43,579
Okay.

1578
01:46:43,579 --> 01:46:47,819
So this is grottobeasts.net.

1579
01:46:47,819 --> 01:46:49,819
Kind of a cool little intro graphic here.

1580
01:46:49,819 --> 01:46:52,470
Scroll down.

1581
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:53,470
Here you go.

1582
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:56,350
Here is the...

1583
01:46:56,350 --> 01:46:57,350
Here's the starter kit.

1584
01:46:57,350 --> 01:47:00,090
Here are the packs.

1585
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:05,579
Also, keep in mind, so the four packs, we wanted to do a bundle of four packs because

1586
01:47:05,579 --> 01:47:06,890
this will save you on shipping.

1587
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:10,890
If you do want to get this and you do want to get more than one of these, this will save

1588
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:11,890
you on shipping.

1589
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:16,479
Do you have ad block on?

1590
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:22,939
Don't pay attention to that.

1591
01:47:22,939 --> 01:47:24,119
Using Chrome?

1592
01:47:24,119 --> 01:47:25,119
What?

1593
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:27,489
It's not Chrome?

1594
01:47:27,489 --> 01:47:30,329
Yeah.

1595
01:47:30,329 --> 01:47:32,329
So here's the product.

1596
01:47:32,329 --> 01:47:34,020
Here it is.

1597
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:36,279
What's wrong with Firefox?

1598
01:47:36,279 --> 01:47:37,279
You got a Firefox problem?

1599
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:38,279
I don't get it.

1600
01:47:38,279 --> 01:47:39,899
So here you go.

1601
01:47:39,899 --> 01:47:42,170
This is the website.

1602
01:47:42,170 --> 01:47:43,170
This is where you go.

1603
01:47:43,170 --> 01:47:47,609
If you want to get it, grottobeasts.net, there's also these.

1604
01:47:47,609 --> 01:47:49,609
These are cards in the game.

1605
01:47:49,609 --> 01:47:53,039
Demonloids, Araxos, Bugleberry, Glooman.

1606
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:58,739
And again, we wanted to make sure that if people wanted to participate and they don't

1607
01:47:58,739 --> 01:47:59,739
want...

1608
01:47:59,739 --> 01:48:03,739
Jerma, I don't have a fucking hundred plus dollars to spend on this shit.

1609
01:48:03,739 --> 01:48:07,279
Well, then if you want to participate and you really still do, I just...

1610
01:48:07,279 --> 01:48:08,279
We wanted to make sure there was stuff available.

1611
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:09,279
We really did.

1612
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:10,460
Here are the merch.

1613
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,460
Here are the shirts.

1614
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:16,699
Coming in an assortment of colors.

1615
01:48:16,699 --> 01:48:17,699
There's hoodies.

1616
01:48:17,699 --> 01:48:19,970
Here down here.

1617
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:23,970
This is the original 40 Beasts for the original stream, which is pretty cool.

1618
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:28,229
You're talking like my mom right now.

1619
01:48:28,229 --> 01:48:32,930
But here's a really cool thing.

1620
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:35,489
So this, this one glows in the dark.

1621
01:48:35,489 --> 01:48:40,880
You can get the glow in the dark version or the one that's not glow in the dark, which

1622
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:41,880
would be this one here.

1623
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:45,020
Yeah, but you can get the glow in the dark hoodie as well.

1624
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:52,020
Are you blazed right now?

1625
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:54,020
And then like hats too and other stuff.

1626
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:55,449
And it's a lot.

1627
01:48:55,449 --> 01:48:58,619
This project is monumental.

1628
01:48:58,619 --> 01:49:05,180
And it's, it's a, it's, I don't know.

1629
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:06,180
Thanks, guys.

1630
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:08,250
This is not possible.

1631
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:12,920
I can't do this project without having the community people that have been supporting

1632
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:17,060
this channel for the last 10 to 12 years.

1633
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:20,810
There's a lot of community references.

1634
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:26,670
There's a hundred, a hundred cards, I think, or 120 cards are here.

1635
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:29,100
There's the original new Grotto Beast.

1636
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:33,279
There's new, there's new characters in here.

1637
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:35,479
And it's really, really cool.

1638
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:40,510
And also I wanted to make sure that I clarify this to the starter kit.

1639
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:43,510
The starter kit does have, there are over a hundred and four.

1640
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:44,510
They're not over.

1641
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:46,510
There's a hundred and four cards in the starter kit.

1642
01:49:46,510 --> 01:49:48,510
That's including the two boosters you get in this.

1643
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:55,569
But the two pre-made decks, there are 80, what, 84 cards.

1644
01:49:55,569 --> 01:49:58,060
They are, there are some doubles.

1645
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:02,560
There are some doubles in here because the way that the decks are made, because remember

1646
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:07,560
you can have up to three in each deck and these both decks are pre-made to kind of do

1647
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,560
a specific play style.

1648
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,180
Yeah, it comes with two packs.

1649
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:13,899
There it is.

1650
01:50:13,899 --> 01:50:15,899
There's your Grotto Beasts.

1651
01:50:15,899 --> 01:50:20,630
Will it be new cards added over time?

1652
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:23,319
I cannot answer that question.

1653
01:50:23,319 --> 01:50:25,319
I cannot answer it.

1654
01:50:25,319 --> 01:50:28,840
Let's get through this first.

1655
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:33,140
We need to see how many people actually really want this because we don't know.

1656
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:36,380
This is a, this is really uncharted territory.

1657
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:43,699
And the two boosters, by the way, are two regular, they're random packs.

1658
01:50:43,699 --> 01:50:47,939
So these, the two decks in here are the same.

1659
01:50:47,939 --> 01:50:48,939
They are pre-built.

1660
01:50:48,939 --> 01:50:50,939
They're the same in every single one of these.

1661
01:50:50,939 --> 01:50:54,939
The two boosters you get in here are as if you had these.

1662
01:50:54,939 --> 01:50:56,300
They're random.

1663
01:50:56,300 --> 01:51:08,210
Again, each one of those has a rare and a holographic in these foil packs.

1664
01:51:08,210 --> 01:51:09,210
How many cards are in the whole game?

1665
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:10,210
200.

1666
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:12,640
There are 200 different cards.

1667
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:20,680
Are there any Polaroids of you flipping off the camera?

1668
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:23,750
No, there aren't.

1669
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:27,989
There's already going to be like holographic versions of some of these cards.

1670
01:51:27,989 --> 01:51:32,300
And I don't know, I feel like that's going to be really fun to watch people just,

1671
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:35,729
hey, look, I got a holographic Meowty or whatever, right?

1672
01:51:35,729 --> 01:51:37,729
Oh, I got a holographic Glueman.

1673
01:51:37,729 --> 01:51:39,729
That's really interesting.

1674
01:51:39,729 --> 01:51:46,100
And I don't want to make me giving the double middle finger like 10 of them randomly to,

1675
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:51,529
I don't know, I don't want that to be some crazy valuable item that then is,

1676
01:51:51,529 --> 01:52:03,189
no, no, I'd rather not like increase the value because it was only going to go in like 10 of them.

1677
01:52:03,189 --> 01:52:05,880
Do we have a list of the rarities?

1678
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,880
I believe we do.

1679
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:15,859
Yes, we do.

1680
01:52:15,859 --> 01:52:18,859
We do have a list of every single rarity and everything.

1681
01:52:18,859 --> 01:52:19,859
So we do.

1682
01:52:19,859 --> 01:52:24,039
Will there be a food mode?

1683
01:52:24,039 --> 01:52:27,180
Are there any glow in the dark cards?

1684
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:29,180
That's an incredibly cool idea.

1685
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:30,180
But the answer is no.

1686
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:35,079
Yeah, we're going to make that of that will be public information.

1687
01:52:35,079 --> 01:52:40,899
So the different rarities and the different all that stuff that will be on the official wiki.

1688
01:52:40,899 --> 01:52:43,069
So that will be public information.

1689
01:52:43,069 --> 01:52:48,000
Yeah, they're clearly marked with a C and an R too.

1690
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
So if it's a rare or common, that's in the you'll see it in the card.

1691
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:56,949
Is there a Mr. Green's card?

1692
01:52:56,949 --> 01:52:57,949
Yes, there is.

1693
01:52:57,949 --> 01:53:08,340
Is buying four single packs cheaper than buying the four pack?

1694
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:12,899
The idea with the four pack was to make it so you didn't.

1695
01:53:12,899 --> 01:53:14,899
So this will save on shipping.

1696
01:53:14,899 --> 01:53:17,840
That was the idea.

1697
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:20,210
It also depends on where you are too.

1698
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,210
Shipping is different for a lot of different areas.

1699
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:31,439
But because if you buy an individual pack, you have to pay shipping for that pack.

1700
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:38,000
So we thought that, OK, if you were going to get more than two, three or four of these,

1701
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,300
and we want to make sure that you're not getting the shipping will be much lower.

1702
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:46,569
If you were just to get these, if you planned on doing that.

1703
01:53:46,569 --> 01:53:54,899
Yeah, it's it's a it's not about the price of the list here.

1704
01:53:54,899 --> 01:53:55,899
It's about shipping.

1705
01:53:55,899 --> 01:54:06,859
How come it ends in ninety five and not nine five like nine eight five?

1706
01:54:06,859 --> 01:54:10,420
We thought about making the booster packs nine eighty five.

1707
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:14,500
But it's just like, yeah, yeah.

1708
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:18,819
Did the pre-made deck have hollows?

1709
01:54:18,819 --> 01:54:21,319
The answer, I believe that that question is no.

1710
01:54:21,319 --> 01:54:26,819
I believe the answer to that question is no.

1711
01:54:26,819 --> 01:54:30,510
But you do get two of these in here.

1712
01:54:30,510 --> 01:54:35,840
So with the starter kit, you will get two hollows.

1713
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:39,840
So I mean, technically you will get two holographic cards if you get here, if you get this box.

1714
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:44,829
So I guess yes, technically speaking.

1715
01:54:44,829 --> 01:54:50,210
Where will the rules be posted?

1716
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:54,619
The rules will be very publicly posted in.

1717
01:54:54,619 --> 01:54:57,619
We're going to talk to the game designer, the rulebook.

1718
01:54:57,619 --> 01:55:00,619
We're going to make sure that people can actually have a condensed version of the rulebook online.

1719
01:55:00,619 --> 01:55:06,060
Are you going to do a stream showing this?

1720
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:12,060
At the very least, there's going to be a video that will show exactly how the game is played.

1721
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:14,430
And we'll watch it.

1722
01:55:14,430 --> 01:55:15,430
We'll talk about it.

1723
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:16,430
I'll link to it.

1724
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:18,430
There'll be plenty of resources on the website.

1725
01:55:18,430 --> 01:55:19,430
I promise.

1726
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:25,920
Let me see this question.

1727
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:26,920
What is limited time?

1728
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,609
Just the starter kit or everything?

1729
01:55:29,609 --> 01:55:31,779
So limited time.

1730
01:55:31,779 --> 01:55:33,779
It's not necessarily time.

1731
01:55:33,779 --> 01:55:36,520
It's inventory.

1732
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:40,140
Because we, like I said, we're doing this pre-sale.

1733
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:46,579
Because I don't want it to say, hey, guys, you've got fucking seven days to buy Grotto Beasts.

1734
01:55:46,579 --> 01:55:48,579
And I don't want to limit it by that.

1735
01:55:48,579 --> 01:55:49,750
I want to limit it.

1736
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:52,750
It's like limited time is accurate.

1737
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:54,750
But it's like limited inventory.

1738
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:55,750
Right?

1739
01:55:55,750 --> 01:56:03,600
Because we, these have been, we printed.

1740
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:04,600
Right?

1741
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,029
Right?

1742
01:56:06,029 --> 01:56:07,029
You know what I'm saying?

1743
01:56:07,029 --> 01:56:08,029
Right?

1744
01:56:08,029 --> 01:56:09,029
I do that a lot, don't I?

1745
01:56:09,029 --> 01:56:17,470
So if you buy it right now, over the next couple of weeks, you're going to get it.

1746
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:22,779
And again, the reason why we did this is to make sure that if you actually want to have this,

1747
01:56:22,779 --> 01:56:26,270
we don't just do a limited run that's six days.

1748
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:32,279
Or we don't just say, hey, it's live and it's live till it's gone and there are 2,000 units.

1749
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:34,460
And when they're gone, they're just gone.

1750
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:36,460
And then it just kind of fucks over everybody.

1751
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:39,850
Right?

1752
01:56:39,850 --> 01:56:50,409
Are the three posters the same as the cards?

1753
01:56:50,409 --> 01:56:51,409
Yes, this is.

1754
01:56:51,409 --> 01:56:53,409
These are the card art.

1755
01:56:53,409 --> 01:56:57,409
This is the exact artwork that is on these respective cards.

1756
01:56:57,409 --> 01:57:01,579
So you're getting essentially a poster print of the card art.

1757
01:57:01,579 --> 01:57:04,850
What size are the posters?

1758
01:57:04,850 --> 01:57:12,979
The posters are in GrottoBasis group chat, if I could get a little bit of an assistance here.

1759
01:57:12,979 --> 01:57:13,979
Is there an auto card?

1760
01:57:13,979 --> 01:57:16,630
Yes, there is.

1761
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:20,000
It is 11 by 17 tabloid poster size.

1762
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:26,590
Yes, there is an auto card.

1763
01:57:26,590 --> 01:57:30,109
Could there be a holographic auto card?

1764
01:57:30,109 --> 01:57:31,109
Yes.

1765
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:32,289
And you bet your ass.

1766
01:57:32,289 --> 01:57:35,640
And you bet your ass.

1767
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,640
You bet your ass I'm going to try to get that one.

1768
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:44,100
What about the Discord?

1769
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:47,649
Yeah, there's an opportunity to have a discussion channel.

1770
01:57:47,649 --> 01:57:51,890
Let me just be really clear about this too.

1771
01:57:51,890 --> 01:57:54,430
This is not the end.

1772
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:56,439
This is not it.

1773
01:57:56,439 --> 01:58:01,819
There is another thing coming that you do not have to purchase.

1774
01:58:01,819 --> 01:58:07,390
That is, I can't fucking wait for you to see it.

1775
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:10,529
It's not anything that you're going to have to buy.

1776
01:58:10,529 --> 01:58:13,829
It's just something really fucking cool.

1777
01:58:13,829 --> 01:58:16,140
You're not going to have to buy it.

1778
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:19,680
There is more.

1779
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:20,680
Yeah.

1780
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:26,380
We have a thing.

1781
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:29,810
How do I even talk about this without leaking anything?

1782
01:58:29,810 --> 01:58:39,319
There's a thing that you're going to see eventually in the next couple of weeks.

1783
01:58:39,319 --> 01:58:41,319
I don't know.

1784
01:58:41,319 --> 01:58:47,020
Is it audio visual?

1785
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:55,189
No.

1786
01:58:55,189 --> 01:58:57,500
I'm done talking.

1787
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:58,500
I'm getting yelled at.

1788
01:58:58,500 --> 01:58:59,500
I'm getting yelled at.

1789
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:00,500
I'm getting yelled at.

1790
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:01,500
I'm getting yelled at.

1791
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:02,800
I'm going to get yelled at.

1792
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:03,800
I'm going to get yelled at.

1793
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:04,800
It's cool.

1794
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:09,800
Whatever this thing that I'm talking about is, it's super interesting and you don't have

1795
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:10,979
to buy it.

1796
01:59:10,979 --> 01:59:11,979
Yeah.

1797
01:59:11,979 --> 01:59:12,979
All right.

1798
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:14,470
Yeah.

1799
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:18,590
Cool.

1800
01:59:18,590 --> 01:59:19,590
But yeah, there it is.

1801
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:25,140
The whole team has been waiting to do this for so long.

1802
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:32,529
There were so many things to fix, so many production issues, so much going on during

1803
01:59:32,529 --> 01:59:35,529
this project that all of us are just super happy that it's actually here.

1804
01:59:35,529 --> 01:59:42,960
When you get it, I hope it makes you happy.

1805
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:43,960
And that's pretty much it.

1806
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:45,960
Am I missing anything GrottoBeast team?

1807
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:56,750
Anything else to say initially here?

1808
01:59:56,750 --> 02:00:10,789
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

1809
02:00:10,789 --> 02:00:15,439
Can you buy this stuff like the dice individually?

1810
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:18,189
We don't have a plan to do that.

1811
02:00:18,189 --> 02:00:25,180
I think the point was to try to increase the value of this because the original prototype

1812
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:27,180
of this was, all right, how does this work?

1813
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:30,920
We have, okay, we're going to have two decks in there.

1814
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:31,920
It's going to be a box.

1815
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,539
All right.

1816
02:00:33,539 --> 02:00:35,539
And how much are we going to charge for this thing?

1817
02:00:35,539 --> 02:00:36,779
All right.

1818
02:00:36,779 --> 02:00:37,779
Put in other stuff.

1819
02:00:37,779 --> 02:00:41,220
Make it a ton of artwork in there.

1820
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:45,460
Have dice in there because some of the things require, you know, dice.

1821
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:48,460
Just like little things to try to make it a little bit more worth it.

1822
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:53,770
Who made the first sauce?

1823
02:00:53,770 --> 02:00:56,859
Exactly.

1824
02:00:56,859 --> 02:00:57,859
All right.

1825
02:00:57,859 --> 02:00:58,859
So here's a really important point.

1826
02:00:58,859 --> 02:01:05,880
Pre-sales won't run out, but getting one sooner might ensure that you get it sooner.

1827
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:09,460
So pre-sales are not going to run out.

1828
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:12,960
But if you order it sooner, you might get it sooner.

1829
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:19,699
It just depends on how we can handle the production.

1830
02:01:19,699 --> 02:01:22,699
They are in production right now, by the way.

1831
02:01:22,699 --> 02:01:24,699
There are, we have an inventory that's in production right now.

1832
02:01:24,699 --> 02:01:32,000
And I will show you, I will show you these things in person.

1833
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,649
So don't worry.

1834
02:01:34,649 --> 02:01:38,909
We want to make it like a nice setup where I can actually show you everything.

1835
02:01:38,909 --> 02:01:43,699
And let me tell you, I love it.

1836
02:01:43,699 --> 02:01:46,260
So if that means anything.

1837
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:54,250
Is there a naked Jerma sitting at his PC card that could be holographic?

1838
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:57,260
Unfortunately, the answer to that question is no.

1839
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:00,260
Although, now that you say that, that's...

1840
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:03,460
Well, here's another thing, too.

1841
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:05,460
We wanted to make this kind of for all ages.

1842
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:08,760
Or at least, you know, ages like 6 and up or whatever.

1843
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:12,939
So there's not a lot of like, there's nothing really like fucked up in here.

1844
02:02:12,939 --> 02:02:18,310
I really wanted to be something that you could play with like your little brother.

1845
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:20,770
Right?

1846
02:02:20,770 --> 02:02:22,770
So it's a general audience product.

1847
02:02:22,770 --> 02:02:30,449
You said you weren't naked though.

1848
02:02:30,449 --> 02:02:32,619
Man, I lie about a lot of stuff.

1849
02:02:32,619 --> 02:02:42,180
Alright, I think we can move on.

1850
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:44,180
I'm going to take one quick VRB here.

1851
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:45,180
Hopefully I covered a lot of stuff.

1852
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:46,180
I know there was a lot.

1853
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:48,180
And that, I don't want to overwhelm people too.

1854
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:50,359
Because I'll be honest, I'm overwhelmed.

1855
02:02:50,359 --> 02:02:52,359
I'm very overwhelmed by this.

1856
02:02:52,359 --> 02:02:55,729
Because this is something we've been waiting to do for so long.

1857
02:02:55,729 --> 02:02:59,229
So I don't want to overwhelm everybody.

1858
02:02:59,229 --> 02:03:03,229
There's a lot of info, a lot of things that we'll be trickling out to you guys over the next few days.

1859
02:03:03,229 --> 02:03:05,500
It's available now.

1860
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:08,380
Hopefully, hopefully you like it.

1861
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:10,380
I know I've said that like a thousand times, but I really do.

1862
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:17,800
Because, yeah, this community means a lot to me.

1863
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:22,640
And when this project became a thing that was going to be real, it was like,

1864
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:24,640
well, let's try to make it fucking awesome.

1865
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:33,069
Because I'm never doing this ever again.

1866
02:03:33,069 --> 02:03:34,069
And it means a lot to me.

1867
02:03:34,069 --> 02:03:41,430
So, I look forward to what you, what you get in your packs.

1868
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:43,430
Cry, cry, cry, cry.

1869
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:53,840
It's a really cool thing for a streamer to do.

1870
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:59,659
I think it is pretty damn cool.

1871
02:03:59,659 --> 02:04:08,289
I hope it translates well.

1872
02:04:08,289 --> 02:04:13,979
But let's go back to Frog Detective.

1873
02:04:13,979 --> 02:04:16,979
I think the whole Grottovice team right now just all went like,

1874
02:04:16,979 --> 02:04:19,220
okay, fuck, alright.

1875
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:22,659
It's here, it's there, you can look at it.

1876
02:04:22,659 --> 02:04:30,380
Yeah, thanks to all of you.

1877
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:34,250
Let's go play Frog Detective.

1878
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:38,920
Your stocks are plummeting.

1879
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:42,020
That's alright.

1880
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:46,939
And yes, if you want to have me answer the question,

1881
02:04:46,939 --> 02:04:49,939
I will probably open some of this on stream.

1882
02:04:49,939 --> 02:04:50,939
Of course I will.

1883
02:04:50,939 --> 02:04:55,399
I will open a few packs and see what I get.

1884
02:04:55,399 --> 02:04:59,600
Really hope of that, you know, auto card.

1885
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:07,829
You seem pretty stressed.

1886
02:05:07,829 --> 02:05:10,289
I'm not stressed.

1887
02:05:10,289 --> 02:05:14,729
I'm excited.

1888
02:05:14,729 --> 02:05:22,619
Alright.

1889
02:05:22,619 --> 02:05:24,060
One more BRB.

1890
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:25,060
Grottovice.net.

1891
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:28,420
Grottobeasts.net.

1892
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:32,420
There's going to be a panel down in the panels under the channel.

1893
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:40,829
That is like looking at it.

1894
02:05:40,829 --> 02:05:41,829
Let's go play Frog Detective.

1895
02:05:41,829 --> 02:05:42,829
I'll be right back.

1896
02:05:42,829 --> 02:05:43,829
Thanks, guys.

1897
02:05:43,829 --> 02:09:07,670
Okay, I have returned.

1898
02:09:07,670 --> 02:09:12,260
I just gave Holly a big hug and a big kiss.

1899
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:21,770
She worked her fucking ass off on this project.

1900
02:09:21,770 --> 02:09:23,840
Everybody did.

1901
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,460
Alright.

1902
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:41,960
He just cried.

1903
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:45,539
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1904
02:09:45,539 --> 02:09:55,079
The core art team, a lot of it is the imagination of that.

1905
02:09:55,079 --> 02:09:57,079
Just the artists.

1906
02:09:57,079 --> 02:10:00,050
It's just, it's unbelievable.

1907
02:10:00,050 --> 02:10:02,050
I'm super happy.

1908
02:10:02,050 --> 02:10:08,449
Alright, let's do funny voices.

1909
02:10:08,449 --> 02:10:14,680
Alright, is this?

1910
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:15,680
Oh, there we go.

1911
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:27,180
The sus guy is sobbing right now.

1912
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:32,739
Wait, I need more flowers?

1913
02:10:32,739 --> 02:10:34,750
No, I don't.

1914
02:10:34,750 --> 02:10:44,949
We need Donald Trump now.

1915
02:10:44,949 --> 02:10:53,420
The Frog Detective voice actor was on hold for the last 30 minutes.

1916
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:56,130
Alright, who's this person?

1917
02:10:56,130 --> 02:11:03,000
Should I put a filter on for this?

1918
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:11,340
What kind of filter should be on?

1919
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:21,140
Tell me what is too much.

1920
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:23,319
That's low pitch.

1921
02:11:23,319 --> 02:11:26,539
This, right?

1922
02:11:26,539 --> 02:11:28,869
How's that?

1923
02:11:28,869 --> 02:11:31,710
Fire?

1924
02:11:31,710 --> 02:11:36,970
Is that good?

1925
02:11:36,970 --> 02:11:38,140
Yeah, that's robotic.

1926
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:41,220
Hold on, what about this?

1927
02:11:41,220 --> 02:11:47,210
They come from far and wide to face off with the powerful Rhonda Dynamite.

1928
02:11:47,210 --> 02:11:48,699
No?

1929
02:11:48,699 --> 02:11:49,699
Does that sound bad?

1930
02:11:49,699 --> 02:11:55,100
How about I just do this?

1931
02:11:55,100 --> 02:12:00,520
They come from far and, I just, I can't.

1932
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:05,460
They come from far and wide to face off with the powerful Rhonda Dynamite.

1933
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:07,279
Rhonda Dynamite?

1934
02:12:07,279 --> 02:12:08,279
We sound pretty similar.

1935
02:12:08,279 --> 02:12:10,220
That's me.

1936
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:11,720
Ready your weapon, Frog.

1937
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:15,340
It's time for us to, can I reset?

1938
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:23,199
Ready, ready, ready your weapon, Frog.

1939
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:26,140
It is time for us to do battle.

1940
02:12:26,140 --> 02:12:30,220
I don't have a weapon and I'm not super interested in doing battle.

1941
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:33,989
Then why are you here to face me?

1942
02:12:33,989 --> 02:12:37,069
This is my land.

1943
02:12:37,069 --> 02:12:41,279
You cannot just waltz in here and expect to take it.

1944
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:42,279
Your land?

1945
02:12:42,279 --> 02:12:43,279
You own the scooter barn?

1946
02:12:43,279 --> 02:12:48,640
But I load up here every day.

1947
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:50,329
Everybody knows.

1948
02:12:50,329 --> 02:12:52,659
Where have you been?

1949
02:12:52,659 --> 02:12:53,659
Do you live under a rock, Frog?

1950
02:12:53,659 --> 02:12:57,609
I thought a lily pad might be more suitable.

1951
02:12:57,609 --> 02:13:02,010
How much have you ever lost on acquaintance?

1952
02:13:02,010 --> 02:13:03,010
You call it.

1953
02:13:03,010 --> 02:13:06,359
You call it.

1954
02:13:06,359 --> 02:13:08,359
I live at 100 Skeleton Street, Slippery Pond.

1955
02:13:08,359 --> 02:13:16,149
That's not Bernie.

1956
02:13:16,149 --> 02:13:19,149
That's not, how is that, that's Kylo Ren?

1957
02:13:19,149 --> 02:13:20,390
No, it's not.

1958
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:30,439
It's neither one of those two things.

1959
02:13:30,439 --> 02:13:32,439
Did you just give me your full address?

1960
02:13:32,439 --> 02:13:35,460
Yes.

1961
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:37,760
You literally just met me.

1962
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:39,449
Don't give your full address to strangers.

1963
02:13:39,449 --> 02:13:41,329
Why not?

1964
02:13:41,329 --> 02:13:44,909
How much are you going to know where I live?

1965
02:13:44,909 --> 02:13:48,140
You have a great point.

1966
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:50,590
What?

1967
02:13:50,590 --> 02:13:51,590
The detective does not have a great point.

1968
02:13:51,590 --> 02:13:55,590
Do not give your address out to strangers unless your house is super cool and mega rich.

1969
02:13:55,590 --> 02:14:00,789
Then tell people where you live because how else are they going to know you live in a mansion?

1970
02:14:00,789 --> 02:14:02,789
Okay, even then just show them a photo.

1971
02:14:02,789 --> 02:14:04,159
Don't give it to them.

1972
02:14:04,159 --> 02:14:05,159
Thanks for playing.

1973
02:14:05,159 --> 02:14:07,170
I'll leave you to it.

1974
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:08,170
Is this stream pre-recorded?

1975
02:14:08,170 --> 02:14:09,170
Nah.

1976
02:14:09,170 --> 02:14:13,329
Anyway, I'm not sure why you're trying to fight me.

1977
02:14:13,329 --> 02:14:16,210
Would you like me to leave?

1978
02:14:16,210 --> 02:14:21,649
I am enjoying having a nice company.

1979
02:14:21,649 --> 02:14:25,899
What do you do?

1980
02:14:25,899 --> 02:14:27,579
Hmm?

1981
02:14:27,579 --> 02:14:29,340
What do you do?

1982
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:30,340
For a job.

1983
02:14:30,340 --> 02:14:32,409
Oh, I'm the detective.

1984
02:14:32,409 --> 02:14:34,409
I'm here to solve the case of the missing hats.

1985
02:14:34,409 --> 02:14:39,130
When you find the culprit, bring him here.

1986
02:14:39,130 --> 02:14:41,199
I'll beat them up.

1987
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:43,340
What?

1988
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:45,659
No.

1989
02:14:45,659 --> 02:14:49,779
Give them a taste of their faces.

1990
02:14:49,779 --> 02:14:51,279
Tie their shoes together and trip them up.

1991
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:53,420
Tell them.

1992
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:56,510
Please, no.

1993
02:14:56,510 --> 02:14:57,750
I'm an outlaw detective.

1994
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:00,310
I hate it when people do the wrong thing.

1995
02:15:00,310 --> 02:15:03,770
That's the opposite of an outlaw.

1996
02:15:03,770 --> 02:15:09,399
I think this life isn't for me anymore.

1997
02:15:09,399 --> 02:15:11,729
Do you think so?

1998
02:15:11,729 --> 02:15:14,539
To be honest with you, detective.

1999
02:15:14,539 --> 02:15:15,720
I was meaning...

2000
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:16,720
Why am I getting z...

2001
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:17,720
Hold on.

2002
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:24,100
To be honest with you, detective, I was meaning to apply for the sheriff's position.

2003
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:26,100
Oh, it was filled just before I got here.

2004
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:31,039
Yeah, I know.

2005
02:15:31,039 --> 02:15:32,039
Why some rendo?

2006
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:36,760
His name is Mason Mole.

2007
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:40,760
I'm sure Lobster Cop wouldn't have given the job just anyone.

2008
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:41,760
He must be very qualified.

2009
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:47,310
Doesn't mean he's not a rendo.

2010
02:15:47,310 --> 02:15:48,619
I suppose not.

2011
02:15:48,619 --> 02:15:52,520
What makes you want to be the sheriff?

2012
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:53,520
I'm a natural leader.

2013
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:54,890
I run the outlaw group.

2014
02:15:54,890 --> 02:15:55,890
Class and style.

2015
02:15:55,890 --> 02:15:57,260
And I love to help others.

2016
02:15:57,260 --> 02:16:00,899
Got a problem that needs solving?

2017
02:16:00,899 --> 02:16:02,140
I'm your girl.

2018
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:04,090
And I'm tough.

2019
02:16:04,090 --> 02:16:05,520
No one is going to mess with me.

2020
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:09,039
Wow, you sound like a great fit for the job.

2021
02:16:15,079 --> 02:16:17,079
Even putting it up your whole life, just call it.

2022
02:16:17,079 --> 02:16:18,579
I think so too.

2023
02:16:18,579 --> 02:16:19,579
But it's too late now.

2024
02:16:19,579 --> 02:16:20,579
Not necessarily.

2025
02:16:20,579 --> 02:16:22,579
You could always talk to Mason Mole.

2026
02:16:22,579 --> 02:16:24,010
Show him your expertise.

2027
02:16:24,010 --> 02:16:27,010
Maybe you could be co-sheriff.

2028
02:16:27,010 --> 02:16:29,829
That's a great idea.

2029
02:16:29,829 --> 02:16:31,829
Do you mind if I question you about the case I'm working on?

2030
02:16:31,829 --> 02:16:35,059
All right, your job.

2031
02:16:35,059 --> 02:16:36,059
What do you do?

2032
02:16:36,059 --> 02:16:37,870
What's going on here?

2033
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:38,870
What kind of...

2034
02:16:39,870 --> 02:16:42,459
What kind of work do you do?

2035
02:16:42,459 --> 02:16:48,500
Well, detective, I'd love to tell you.

2036
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:49,500
But I need to know how I can trust you.

2037
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:51,829
Oh, I understand.

2038
02:16:51,829 --> 02:16:55,260
If you're worried about me telling on you, I won't tell.

2039
02:16:55,260 --> 02:16:57,260
My only concern today is the mystery of the missing hat.

2040
02:16:57,260 --> 02:17:01,590
If you've stolen the hat, I will totally tell on you though.

2041
02:17:01,590 --> 02:17:04,370
That's reasonable.

2042
02:17:04,370 --> 02:17:07,399
I'm a mouse with many skills.

2043
02:17:07,399 --> 02:17:09,579
I specialize in forgery and fraud.

2044
02:17:09,579 --> 02:17:12,649
Wow, sounds intense.

2045
02:17:12,649 --> 02:17:15,340
It's mostly a lot of printing stuff out.

2046
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:18,620
I can forge all types of things.

2047
02:17:18,620 --> 02:17:19,799
Important documents.

2048
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:20,799
Birth certificates.

2049
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:21,799
IDs.

2050
02:17:21,799 --> 02:17:23,680
You name it.

2051
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:27,680
Ooh, you could forge a certificate that says number one best detective?

2052
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:31,030
No reason.

2053
02:17:31,030 --> 02:17:32,270
I'm just joking.

2054
02:17:32,270 --> 02:17:33,270
Pretend I didn't say that.

2055
02:17:33,270 --> 02:17:38,370
Mind if I question you about the case I'm working on?

2056
02:17:38,370 --> 02:17:41,079
All right, so wait.

2057
02:17:41,079 --> 02:17:42,079
I can get a fake ID, right?

2058
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:45,860
How do you intend to become the sheriff?

2059
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:47,799
By force.

2060
02:17:47,799 --> 02:17:53,799
I will simply beat up Mason Mole.

2061
02:17:53,799 --> 02:17:54,799
You can't do that.

2062
02:17:54,799 --> 02:17:56,659
Yes, I can.

2063
02:17:56,659 --> 02:17:58,100
I'm Rhonda Dynamite.

2064
02:17:58,100 --> 02:17:59,100
The rules do not apply to me.

2065
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:03,940
What did Mason Mole ever do to you?

2066
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:05,819
He's shifty.

2067
02:18:05,819 --> 02:18:07,700
Just don't trust his face.

2068
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:08,700
Please don't take the role by force.

2069
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:10,700
Have you tried submitting a resume?

2070
02:18:10,700 --> 02:18:12,649
A resume, you say?

2071
02:18:12,649 --> 02:18:17,280
Like a list of my skills and experiences?

2072
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:20,280
Yeah, I think that would be a better option than beating up Sheriff Mason Mole.

2073
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:24,770
That's fun, though.

2074
02:18:24,770 --> 02:18:26,770
I don't really have the writing supplies for making a resume.

2075
02:18:26,770 --> 02:18:31,579
If I had paper and stuff, I would be managing it.

2076
02:18:31,579 --> 02:18:32,579
I can get you the writing supplies.

2077
02:18:32,579 --> 02:18:34,579
Just please don't beat up the sheriff.

2078
02:18:34,579 --> 02:18:38,440
I was just thinking about it.

2079
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:41,510
Mind if I question you about the case?

2080
02:18:41,510 --> 02:18:43,940
All right, so we got to get something to write.

2081
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:59,379
We got to get writing tools to write a resume and learn some nonviolent conflict resolution skills.

2082
02:18:59,379 --> 02:19:00,620
Wants to fight me?

2083
02:19:00,620 --> 02:19:01,620
No, wait.

2084
02:19:03,629 --> 02:19:04,629
That was my full address.

2085
02:19:04,629 --> 02:19:08,940
Dreams of being the sheriff.

2086
02:19:08,940 --> 02:19:09,940
Okay, sounds good.

2087
02:19:09,940 --> 02:19:11,940
Do you have anything over here I can look at?

2088
02:19:11,940 --> 02:19:27,799
Who wanted the four flowers?

2089
02:19:27,799 --> 02:19:28,799
Did anybody want that yet?

2090
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:36,340
Fake ID, left alone, proof of ghost, amuse.

2091
02:19:36,340 --> 02:19:37,959
Does that work?

2092
02:19:37,959 --> 02:19:39,840
Oh, cactus flower.

2093
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:40,840
Okay.

2094
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:41,840
Bonnie.

2095
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,270
Bonnie needs it.

2096
02:19:43,270 --> 02:19:47,969
I have got.

2097
02:19:47,969 --> 02:19:49,969
I completely forget this voice.

2098
02:19:49,969 --> 02:19:50,969
I have no idea what it was.

2099
02:19:50,969 --> 02:19:51,969
I completely forget.

2100
02:19:51,969 --> 02:19:56,690
Can I ask you some questions?

2101
02:19:56,690 --> 02:20:00,739
Cactus flowers.

2102
02:20:00,739 --> 02:20:01,739
I've just been flower picking.

2103
02:20:01,739 --> 02:20:03,620
Great.

2104
02:20:03,620 --> 02:20:06,809
Here's what I've collected so far.

2105
02:20:06,809 --> 02:20:07,809
I'll add them to the stew.

2106
02:20:07,809 --> 02:20:11,690
I really wish you told me that the cactus flowers are so hard to get.

2107
02:20:11,690 --> 02:20:15,190
I nearly pricked myself.

2108
02:20:15,190 --> 02:20:16,190
Did you?

2109
02:20:16,190 --> 02:20:17,430
That's so funny.

2110
02:20:17,430 --> 02:20:20,360
It's not funny at all.

2111
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:21,360
It's hilarious.

2112
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:23,370
It's not hilarious.

2113
02:20:23,370 --> 02:20:27,959
That would have hurt.

2114
02:20:27,959 --> 02:20:29,260
Up, up, up, up.

2115
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:31,139
Yeah, it would have.

2116
02:20:31,139 --> 02:20:33,139
Good thing I managed to find some gloves.

2117
02:20:33,139 --> 02:20:35,770
Ew, like secondhand gloves?

2118
02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:40,680
First and secondhand, yep.

2119
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:41,680
Well, thanks for getting them.

2120
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:43,110
No problem.

2121
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:45,569
Ooh.

2122
02:20:45,569 --> 02:20:49,239
What did I get?

2123
02:20:49,239 --> 02:20:50,239
Oh, what else has to go in the stew?

2124
02:20:50,239 --> 02:20:51,479
Nothing else, right?

2125
02:20:51,479 --> 02:21:01,360
Cool.

2126
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:03,370
All right.

2127
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:04,370
The graveyard is haunted.

2128
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:07,459
It needs a key.

2129
02:21:07,459 --> 02:21:08,459
This gate needs a key.

2130
02:21:08,459 --> 02:21:12,280
Perhaps I should find one and get lobster cops to help open it.

2131
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:13,280
Oh, carrots.

2132
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:17,909
Right, right, right, right.

2133
02:21:17,909 --> 02:21:18,909
All right.

2134
02:21:18,909 --> 02:21:20,920
You need writing utensils.

2135
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:21,920
You need a muse.

2136
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:25,379
We have not even spoken to you.

2137
02:21:25,379 --> 02:21:29,110
I just...

2138
02:21:29,110 --> 02:21:42,450
Somebody said don't do Trump.

2139
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:43,450
You just fucked me up.

2140
02:21:43,450 --> 02:21:50,709
I literally read do not do Trump in all capitals when I said the first two lines.

2141
02:21:50,709 --> 02:21:53,739
Okay.

2142
02:21:53,739 --> 02:21:56,649
Do it.

2143
02:21:56,649 --> 02:21:57,649
Now, yeah.

2144
02:21:57,649 --> 02:21:59,340
All right.

2145
02:21:59,340 --> 02:22:02,299
Good afternoon.

2146
02:22:02,299 --> 02:22:04,299
Welcome to Cowboy County General Store.

2147
02:22:04,299 --> 02:22:05,540
My name is Wendy.

2148
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:09,620
We have a wide range of general goods for purchase.

2149
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:11,819
Hi.

2150
02:22:11,819 --> 02:22:12,819
I'm Frog Detective.

2151
02:22:12,819 --> 02:22:16,819
Unfortunately, at this time, we don't stock any gear for detective work.

2152
02:22:16,819 --> 02:22:17,819
I mean, it's some of the best.

2153
02:22:17,819 --> 02:22:18,819
Some of the best gear.

2154
02:22:18,819 --> 02:22:20,190
We don't have it.

2155
02:22:20,190 --> 02:22:22,520
I don't need anything.

2156
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:29,500
Um, please feel free to browse our expansive selection.

2157
02:22:29,500 --> 02:22:31,739
I'm sure you'll find what you need.

2158
02:22:31,739 --> 02:22:32,739
Believe me.

2159
02:22:32,739 --> 02:22:34,940
No, thank you.

2160
02:22:34,940 --> 02:22:37,579
No, thank you.

2161
02:22:37,579 --> 02:22:41,579
We have a wide range of general goods for purchase.

2162
02:22:41,579 --> 02:22:44,040
Yes.

2163
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:48,559
Do you need a specific item that isn't in stock?

2164
02:22:48,559 --> 02:22:55,090
We process special orders at no extra cost to the consumer.

2165
02:22:55,090 --> 02:22:59,090
And I mean, the consumer is obviously the most important thing that we have here.

2166
02:22:59,090 --> 02:23:02,500
I don't really need anything.

2167
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:06,510
Special orders have an average two-day turnaround.

2168
02:23:06,510 --> 02:23:10,510
And by the way, the special interests that are fighting against me, believe me.

2169
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:11,510
Yeah.

2170
02:23:11,510 --> 02:23:14,479
Fake news media.

2171
02:23:14,479 --> 02:23:17,319
Stick with them.

2172
02:23:17,319 --> 02:23:20,739
That's a great turnaround.

2173
02:23:20,739 --> 02:23:21,739
We have many great policies.

2174
02:23:21,739 --> 02:23:24,059
Such as?

2175
02:23:24,059 --> 02:23:29,329
We're proud to offer our customers a satisfaction guarantee on all purchases.

2176
02:23:29,329 --> 02:23:34,899
What's a satisfaction guarantee?

2177
02:23:34,899 --> 02:23:41,100
We can guarantee that you will be either satisfied or dissatisfied with your purchase.

2178
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:44,940
What happens if I'm dissatisfied?

2179
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:48,069
That falls within our satisfaction guarantee.

2180
02:23:48,069 --> 02:23:52,100
If I can get a refund?

2181
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:54,100
This impression sucks.

2182
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:59,100
You can't say that.

2183
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:00,100
All right.

2184
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:01,100
Let me tell you something.

2185
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:02,100
You can't say that.

2186
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:04,530
Ten minutes into an impression.

2187
02:24:04,530 --> 02:24:07,790
You got to stop me immediately.

2188
02:24:07,790 --> 02:24:08,790
You got to stop me immediately.

2189
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:09,790
Hey, hey, man.

2190
02:24:09,790 --> 02:24:10,790
I got an impression for you.

2191
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:11,790
Oh, here we go.

2192
02:24:11,790 --> 02:24:12,790
Let me tell you something.

2193
02:24:12,790 --> 02:24:13,790
My name is Donald Trump.

2194
02:24:13,790 --> 02:24:14,790
And let me talk to you.

2195
02:24:14,790 --> 02:24:17,790
And you just sit there and nod for ten minutes.

2196
02:24:17,790 --> 02:24:18,790
Yeah.

2197
02:24:18,790 --> 02:24:19,969
Yeah.

2198
02:24:19,969 --> 02:24:20,969
Mm-hmm.

2199
02:24:20,969 --> 02:24:21,969
And by the way, the special interests.

2200
02:24:21,969 --> 02:24:22,969
Yeah.

2201
02:24:22,969 --> 02:24:23,969
Mm-hmm.

2202
02:24:23,969 --> 02:24:24,969
Mm-hmm.

2203
02:24:24,969 --> 02:24:26,340
Mm-hmm.

2204
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:30,340
So, and then eventually after eight straight minutes, you go, hey, I just want to cut you off for a second.

2205
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:31,340
This is bad.

2206
02:24:31,340 --> 02:24:36,649
It's like, man, you let me do my whole routine.

2207
02:24:36,649 --> 02:24:38,649
You let me do my entire routine.

2208
02:24:38,649 --> 02:24:42,059
Can I get a refund?

2209
02:24:42,059 --> 02:24:49,969
The satisfaction guarantee only guarantees a range of satisfaction from dissatisfied to satisfied.

2210
02:24:49,969 --> 02:24:57,020
If you're feeling towards the product doesn't fall within that range, you're entitled to a refund.

2211
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:59,030
That clears it up.

2212
02:24:59,030 --> 02:25:02,059
Thanks.

2213
02:25:02,059 --> 02:25:05,329
Anyway, I'm actually here to ask some questions about the case.

2214
02:25:05,329 --> 02:25:08,329
Unfortunately, we don't have cases in stock at this time.

2215
02:25:08,329 --> 02:25:11,500
And now it's kind of turning into what is this?

2216
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:15,739
I don't know why there's extra S's and H's at the end of this now.

2217
02:25:15,739 --> 02:25:16,739
Why?

2218
02:25:16,739 --> 02:25:20,100
What is it turning into?

2219
02:25:20,100 --> 02:25:24,059
The mystery, I mean, of the Stonehats.

2220
02:25:24,059 --> 02:25:28,500
Stealing is not permitted at Cowboy County General Store.

2221
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:29,989
I would know.

2222
02:25:29,989 --> 02:25:30,989
I know.

2223
02:25:30,989 --> 02:25:31,989
Trust me.

2224
02:25:31,989 --> 02:25:32,989
If there's anybody that knows about this, it's me.

2225
02:25:32,989 --> 02:25:34,989
Nobody knows this better than I do.

2226
02:25:34,989 --> 02:25:35,989
Nobody knows this better than me.

2227
02:25:35,989 --> 02:25:39,549
Nobody knows the County General Store better than I do.

2228
02:25:39,549 --> 02:25:44,629
Okay?

2229
02:25:44,629 --> 02:25:51,860
This is SNL Trump.

2230
02:25:51,860 --> 02:25:54,360
It's not permitted anywhere, really.

2231
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:57,360
To be clear, I'm not here to purchase or steal any items from your store.

2232
02:25:57,360 --> 02:25:59,180
It's Cartman.

2233
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:02,979
Yeah.

2234
02:26:02,979 --> 02:26:05,049
But whatever.

2235
02:26:05,049 --> 02:26:06,049
It's all right.

2236
02:26:06,049 --> 02:26:12,260
I'm here in official business to solve the mystery of the Stonehats in Cowboy County.

2237
02:26:12,260 --> 02:26:14,329
Right.

2238
02:26:14,329 --> 02:26:17,329
It would have been a lot easier for me if you'd said that in the first place.

2239
02:26:17,329 --> 02:26:26,780
I feel like Crooked Hillary just spent so much time explaining the policies and values of my store.

2240
02:26:26,780 --> 02:26:29,979
It's been embarrassing for me, really.

2241
02:26:29,979 --> 02:26:30,979
Really.

2242
02:26:30,979 --> 02:26:31,979
Believe me, really.

2243
02:26:31,979 --> 02:26:36,799
Like, maybe in future, just tell people what you're here for.

2244
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:38,799
You know, just tell people what you're here for.

2245
02:26:38,799 --> 02:26:40,799
I mean, what do you want me to say?

2246
02:26:40,799 --> 02:26:43,129
Yes, absolutely right.

2247
02:26:43,129 --> 02:26:46,780
I'm not good at communicating quickly.

2248
02:26:46,780 --> 02:26:47,780
I get easily swept up in conversation.

2249
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:48,780
Sorry.

2250
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:53,549
Ever since you started doing the Trump impression, the viewer count has gone down.

2251
02:26:53,549 --> 02:26:55,819
Weakness.

2252
02:26:55,819 --> 02:27:09,250
Hey, if you can't handle me at my Eric Cartman SNL Trump impression,

2253
02:27:09,250 --> 02:27:13,879
then you do not deserve me at my Frog Detective.

2254
02:27:14,879 --> 02:27:15,879
You know what I'm saying?

2255
02:27:15,879 --> 02:27:20,379
Quick, double down.

2256
02:27:20,379 --> 02:27:21,379
Yeah, yeah, of course.

2257
02:27:21,379 --> 02:27:23,709
It's fine.

2258
02:27:23,709 --> 02:27:25,889
I just feel a bit self-conscious.

2259
02:27:25,889 --> 02:27:26,889
No, no, you did great.

2260
02:27:26,889 --> 02:27:30,639
I learned a lot about you and your store policies.

2261
02:27:30,639 --> 02:27:33,520
I'm glad to hear that.

2262
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:35,520
It hasn't been easy taking over the shop.

2263
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:38,139
You seem like an old hand at it.

2264
02:27:38,139 --> 02:27:40,920
That's great.

2265
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:41,920
I'm not at all.

2266
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:46,809
I've only been running the shop for seven months.

2267
02:27:46,809 --> 02:27:51,309
Oh, cool.

2268
02:27:51,309 --> 02:27:53,309
Can I ask you some questions?

2269
02:27:53,309 --> 02:28:00,299
New job.

2270
02:28:00,299 --> 02:28:02,299
So you just started running the shop.

2271
02:28:02,299 --> 02:28:03,299
How is it all going?

2272
02:28:03,299 --> 02:28:07,110
I wish I could say I'm nailing it, but honestly, I'm nailing it.

2273
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:09,110
Who's to say I'm not?

2274
02:28:09,110 --> 02:28:11,110
Nobody nails it better than I do.

2275
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:13,110
Doesn't feel like that most of the time, but it is.

2276
02:28:13,110 --> 02:28:18,090
That's no good.

2277
02:28:18,090 --> 02:28:20,090
The shop has been in my family for generations.

2278
02:28:20,090 --> 02:28:23,090
I thought in my hands, it would be the best it's ever been.

2279
02:28:23,090 --> 02:28:25,389
But it's just kind of the same.

2280
02:28:25,389 --> 02:28:26,389
The same is good.

2281
02:28:26,389 --> 02:28:27,389
At least it's not worse than it was.

2282
02:28:27,389 --> 02:28:29,819
I suppose you're right, Kyle.

2283
02:28:29,819 --> 02:28:34,620
Is there anything that would boost your confidence?

2284
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:39,510
Well, Kyle, there's one thing.

2285
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:40,510
What's that?

2286
02:28:40,510 --> 02:28:47,770
Do you see these portraits on the wall?

2287
02:28:47,770 --> 02:28:49,389
They're lovely.

2288
02:28:49,389 --> 02:28:52,389
Every shop owner in my family has had a beautiful portrait

2289
02:28:52,389 --> 02:28:54,389
created of them, except for me.

2290
02:28:54,389 --> 02:28:57,389
Big, beautiful portrait with a big, beautiful door.

2291
02:28:57,389 --> 02:28:59,760
Big, beautiful door on it, you know.

2292
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:00,760
Believe me.

2293
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:01,760
Except for me.

2294
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:03,379
Mine's a silly photo.

2295
02:29:03,379 --> 02:29:07,569
I don't like it.

2296
02:29:07,569 --> 02:29:17,030
Suck my bow, Kyle.

2297
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:21,340
He's definitely high.

2298
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:22,340
I am fine.

2299
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:23,340
I am not.

2300
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:24,340
I promise you.

2301
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:27,500
Yeah, sure.

2302
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:28,500
But it's not the same.

2303
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:29,680
I haven't got the slightest idea.

2304
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:33,680
And then, obviously, when mom or dad is sick of doing the voice reading

2305
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:37,860
the story to the children, it becomes kind of like a half-assed version

2306
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:39,860
of what it was in the first two seconds, right?

2307
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:42,670
I haven't got the slightest idea how I'm supposed to get someone

2308
02:29:42,670 --> 02:29:43,670
to create a beautiful portrait.

2309
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:45,670
I don't even know who painted those ones.

2310
02:29:45,670 --> 02:29:48,040
Have you tried painting one yourself?

2311
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:49,280
With what time?

2312
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:51,280
And besides, art was never my strong suit.

2313
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:53,100
Maybe you could paint it for me.

2314
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:55,229
I wish.

2315
02:29:55,229 --> 02:29:56,229
I'm not much of a painter.

2316
02:29:56,229 --> 02:30:00,540
Well, if you find anyone that wants to paint me,

2317
02:30:00,540 --> 02:30:04,540
can you let me know and let me tell me exactly?

2318
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:05,540
I'm done.

2319
02:30:05,540 --> 02:30:07,899
How are they supposed to know if they want to paint you

2320
02:30:07,899 --> 02:30:08,899
if they can't see you?

2321
02:30:08,899 --> 02:30:11,209
Here, take this photo of me.

2322
02:30:11,209 --> 02:30:13,899
Okay, kind of weird.

2323
02:30:13,899 --> 02:30:14,899
What's weird, Ka?

2324
02:30:14,899 --> 02:30:17,459
Just carrying around a photo of you on the off chance

2325
02:30:17,459 --> 02:30:19,459
that I find a painter who can paint you a portrait.

2326
02:30:19,459 --> 02:30:23,040
You have not absorbed any of this, have you?

2327
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:24,040
No, none.

2328
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:25,040
Literally, I don't even know what the conversation has been.

2329
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:30,260
I've just bonetically been pronouncing words.

2330
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:31,260
I don't know what...

2331
02:30:31,260 --> 02:30:32,260
I have no...

2332
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:34,260
If you offered me a million dollars to tell you what happened in here,

2333
02:30:34,260 --> 02:30:36,819
I wouldn't be able to do it.

2334
02:30:36,819 --> 02:30:40,639
You could open up a briefcase with stacks of 10 grand

2335
02:30:40,639 --> 02:30:44,010
and I would say, I'm sorry, I have no fucking idea what just happened.

2336
02:30:44,010 --> 02:30:47,040
I'm sorry.

2337
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:50,430
I don't think that's weird.

2338
02:30:50,430 --> 02:30:51,670
Okay, sorry.

2339
02:30:51,670 --> 02:30:55,489
All right, so we got to get, I think, the painter.

2340
02:30:55,489 --> 02:30:59,420
That makes sense.

2341
02:30:59,420 --> 02:31:06,350
Well, that would be right.

2342
02:31:06,350 --> 02:31:08,299
Oh, shit.

2343
02:31:08,299 --> 02:31:09,299
I made a million dollars.

2344
02:31:09,299 --> 02:31:12,690
All right, let's go give it to the painter.

2345
02:31:12,690 --> 02:31:21,709
Who would pay you a million dollars?

2346
02:31:21,709 --> 02:31:29,299
Well, it's just a large sum of money to make a point.

2347
02:31:29,299 --> 02:31:30,930
You know what I'm saying?

2348
02:31:30,930 --> 02:31:36,819
No, kitty, this is my pot path.

2349
02:31:36,819 --> 02:31:43,750
Oh, look at that.

2350
02:31:43,750 --> 02:31:45,180
Can I buy these carrots?

2351
02:31:45,180 --> 02:31:46,620
You have money.

2352
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:48,620
I sure do.

2353
02:31:48,620 --> 02:31:50,500
Okay, no need to brag.

2354
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:51,500
Take as many as you need.

2355
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:53,250
Thanks.

2356
02:31:53,250 --> 02:31:56,020
This goes in the stew.

2357
02:31:56,020 --> 02:32:01,809
Mmm.

2358
02:32:07,850 --> 02:32:16,579
Where?

2359
02:32:16,579 --> 02:32:17,579
Oh, you're, no, they're in the saloon, right?

2360
02:32:17,579 --> 02:32:22,569
Carrot appreciation rant incoming.

2361
02:32:22,569 --> 02:32:23,569
I mean, carrots are amazing.

2362
02:32:23,569 --> 02:32:24,569
They go in everything.

2363
02:32:24,569 --> 02:32:32,520
I want you to name me a, name me a food, like a stew or a side dish.

2364
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:38,020
Name me a dish that you've eaten where you didn't want the carrots on the plate.

2365
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:40,219
I can't tell you one.

2366
02:32:40,219 --> 02:32:43,760
No, no, no, no.

2367
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:44,760
I'm not talking weird shit.

2368
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:46,760
Not, oh, put carrots on pizza.

2369
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:54,309
Dishes that have carrots in it, they, I would never want them removed.

2370
02:32:54,309 --> 02:32:59,200
Hmm.

2371
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:00,200
Can I ask you some questions?

2372
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:01,569
Go ahead.

2373
02:33:01,569 --> 02:33:06,620
I found a photograph for you to paint.

2374
02:33:06,620 --> 02:33:08,059
Oh.

2375
02:33:08,059 --> 02:33:09,059
Can I see it?

2376
02:33:09,059 --> 02:33:10,420
Here you go.

2377
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:12,989
Hmm.

2378
02:33:12,989 --> 02:33:14,809
Wow.

2379
02:33:14,809 --> 02:33:15,809
This is beautiful.

2380
02:33:15,809 --> 02:33:18,989
Is this Wendy from the store?

2381
02:33:18,989 --> 02:33:19,989
It sure is.

2382
02:33:19,989 --> 02:33:23,000
It would be my absolute pleasure to paint this.

2383
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,559
I did it.

2384
02:33:24,559 --> 02:33:26,309
What?

2385
02:33:26,309 --> 02:33:28,260
I lifted the witch's curse.

2386
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:30,709
I mean, I guess.

2387
02:33:30,709 --> 02:33:34,340
Seems like it was probably a prank.

2388
02:33:34,340 --> 02:33:37,020
Oh, I thought you said it was scary.

2389
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:40,100
I don't think I said that.

2390
02:33:40,100 --> 02:33:41,719
I'm really brave.

2391
02:33:41,719 --> 02:33:42,719
Doesn't seem like something I would say.

2392
02:33:42,719 --> 02:33:45,750
Right.

2393
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:46,750
I must be mistaken.

2394
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:48,500
It's okay.

2395
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:51,750
We all make mistakes.

2396
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:54,059
Well, not me so much.

2397
02:33:54,059 --> 02:33:57,000
Will this work as your new muse?

2398
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,059
Absolutely.

2399
02:34:00,059 --> 02:34:01,059
Stay right there.

2400
02:34:01,059 --> 02:34:12,559
I'm going to paint it immediately.

2401
02:34:12,559 --> 02:34:13,559
Oh, it's cute.

2402
02:34:13,559 --> 02:34:15,500
And voila.

2403
02:34:15,500 --> 02:34:17,059
Wow.

2404
02:34:17,059 --> 02:34:18,559
It's beautiful.

2405
02:34:18,559 --> 02:34:19,559
Thank you.

2406
02:34:19,559 --> 02:34:20,559
I'm so proud of it.

2407
02:34:20,559 --> 02:34:23,739
What are you going to do with it now?

2408
02:34:23,739 --> 02:34:25,739
Oh, this is just a warmup for me.

2409
02:34:25,739 --> 02:34:28,430
You can keep this portrait if you'd like.

2410
02:34:28,430 --> 02:34:29,930
Really?

2411
02:34:29,930 --> 02:34:31,940
Yeah.

2412
02:34:31,940 --> 02:34:33,370
Or throw it out.

2413
02:34:33,370 --> 02:34:35,719
I don't mind.

2414
02:34:35,719 --> 02:34:37,719
I'm just happy I got my talent back.

2415
02:34:37,719 --> 02:34:41,370
The talent was inside you all along.

2416
02:34:41,370 --> 02:34:45,510
No, it wasn't.

2417
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:46,510
Okay.

2418
02:34:46,510 --> 02:34:57,610
That's a sad.

2419
02:34:57,610 --> 02:34:58,610
That is sad.

2420
02:34:58,610 --> 02:35:04,440
Yeah.

2421
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:05,440
All right.

2422
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:06,440
We got more things to deliver.

2423
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:09,450
I can put the carrots in.

2424
02:35:09,450 --> 02:35:16,469
Let's finish the stew.

2425
02:35:16,469 --> 02:35:17,709
Okay.

2426
02:35:17,709 --> 02:35:21,510
Here you go.

2427
02:35:21,510 --> 02:35:23,510
I managed to prepare some carrots for your stew.

2428
02:35:23,510 --> 02:35:25,520
You're the best detective.

2429
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:28,079
How did you even manage that?

2430
02:35:28,079 --> 02:35:30,829
I simply went next door and bought some.

2431
02:35:30,829 --> 02:35:31,829
That's so cool.

2432
02:35:31,829 --> 02:35:34,309
I'll add them to the stew now.

2433
02:35:34,309 --> 02:35:35,309
Hey, would you look at that?

2434
02:35:35,309 --> 02:35:36,739
What?

2435
02:35:36,739 --> 02:35:40,120
You got all the ingredients.

2436
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:42,120
I mean, it was a pretty simple task.

2437
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:44,680
I'm so proud of you.

2438
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:47,329
What's wrong?

2439
02:35:47,329 --> 02:35:50,079
Here's a little condescending.

2440
02:35:50,079 --> 02:35:53,659
What's condescending about being proud of you?

2441
02:35:53,659 --> 02:35:56,989
All I did was pick some flowers and go to the store.

2442
02:35:56,989 --> 02:36:00,750
That's more than I did.

2443
02:36:00,750 --> 02:36:02,500
I suppose.

2444
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:03,500
Just give me a second.

2445
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:05,510
I'll finish up the stew and give you some.

2446
02:36:05,510 --> 02:36:06,510
Great.

2447
02:36:06,510 --> 02:36:07,510
Thanks.

2448
02:36:07,510 --> 02:36:09,260
I reckon I could give this to Laptocop.

2449
02:36:09,260 --> 02:36:22,090
Do whatever you want.

2450
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:25,090
Carrots are Satan's belt-tipped pen.

2451
02:36:25,090 --> 02:36:31,219
That's actually kind of a...

2452
02:36:31,219 --> 02:36:33,219
That was a very eloquent way to put that.

2453
02:36:33,219 --> 02:36:35,219
Even though I don't agree with you.

2454
02:36:35,219 --> 02:36:38,979
That was masterfully written.

2455
02:36:38,979 --> 02:36:41,979
That was a masterfully written statement.

2456
02:36:41,979 --> 02:36:44,469
Stop saying right.

2457
02:36:44,469 --> 02:36:50,420
I gotta get that out of my system.

2458
02:36:50,420 --> 02:36:52,420
That cadence, I'm so aware of it now.

2459
02:36:52,420 --> 02:37:05,540
I like this little worm.

2460
02:37:05,540 --> 02:37:09,000
You say like a lot.

2461
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,000
You say write a lot.

2462
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I say you know what I mean a lot.

2463
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
I say okay.

2464
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
You know what I mean?

2465
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Okay.

2466
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Hear me out on this.

2467
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:23,899
I have like four ways to start or stop a sentence.

2468
02:37:23,899 --> 02:37:30,430
It's kind of my version of saying over.

2469
02:37:30,430 --> 02:37:33,979
Yeah.

2470
02:37:33,979 --> 02:37:34,979
Back the truck up a little bit.

2471
02:37:34,979 --> 02:37:37,430
Over.

2472
02:37:37,430 --> 02:37:38,430
Yeah.

2473
02:37:38,430 --> 02:37:39,430
It looks like we have a...

2474
02:37:39,430 --> 02:37:41,250
Well, the supply is doing pretty good.

2475
02:37:41,250 --> 02:37:42,250
Over.

2476
02:37:42,250 --> 02:37:46,750
That's how you know that I'm done with that sentence.

2477
02:37:46,750 --> 02:37:47,930
All right.

2478
02:37:47,930 --> 02:37:48,930
So we got that.

2479
02:37:48,930 --> 02:37:57,020
Oh.

2480
02:37:57,020 --> 02:38:06,000
Fake ID.

2481
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,180
What do I do with the shovel?

2482
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:09,180
Let me give the stew to the Laptocop.

2483
02:38:09,180 --> 02:38:18,420
Oh.

2484
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:20,870
Are you finished?

2485
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:21,870
Did you find all the things I asked for?

2486
02:38:21,870 --> 02:38:24,899
Oh.

2487
02:38:24,899 --> 02:38:28,129
I'm still looking.

2488
02:38:28,129 --> 02:38:34,440
You also say what do you want about and let me tell you something right now.

2489
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:35,440
Yeah.

2490
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:45,899
I do.

2491
02:38:45,899 --> 02:38:48,159
Oh.

2492
02:38:48,159 --> 02:38:49,159
It's a map.

2493
02:38:49,159 --> 02:39:00,959
Oh.

2494
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:01,959
I needed that.

2495
02:39:01,959 --> 02:39:02,959
Okay.

2496
02:39:02,959 --> 02:39:07,340
So there's a well that I haven't been to.

2497
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:09,090
I went to the mine.

2498
02:39:09,090 --> 02:39:10,090
I got the shovel.

2499
02:39:10,090 --> 02:39:12,159
Crime scene map meal.

2500
02:39:12,159 --> 02:39:14,739
All right.

2501
02:39:14,739 --> 02:39:15,739
So I have the meal.

2502
02:39:15,739 --> 02:39:16,739
Let me go to that well.

2503
02:39:16,739 --> 02:39:22,780
That well is down the road here.

2504
02:39:22,780 --> 02:39:23,780
And okay.

2505
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:25,659
Around here.

2506
02:39:25,659 --> 02:39:26,659
Yeah.

2507
02:39:26,659 --> 02:39:27,659
I do say like a lot.

2508
02:39:27,659 --> 02:39:28,659
I'm really aware of that.

2509
02:39:28,659 --> 02:39:29,899
I think the reason why I say like a lot is not that the vocabulary is not there.

2510
02:39:29,899 --> 02:39:32,899
It's just my brain almost has to be a hard drive and find it.

2511
02:39:32,899 --> 02:39:36,510
It's kind of...

2512
02:39:36,510 --> 02:39:40,309
Whenever I say the word, whenever I say like, you can see the hard drive blinking light

2513
02:39:40,309 --> 02:39:41,309
on the back of my head.

2514
02:39:41,309 --> 02:39:42,620
Go.

2515
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:49,950
Like I have my vocabulary is there.

2516
02:39:49,950 --> 02:39:52,959
It's just a search for it.

2517
02:39:52,959 --> 02:40:09,219
This is well.

2518
02:40:09,219 --> 02:40:10,219
It's a filler word.

2519
02:40:10,219 --> 02:40:13,319
Yeah.

2520
02:40:13,319 --> 02:40:15,319
It's actually kind of funny because I've been a little more conscious of it recently.

2521
02:40:15,319 --> 02:40:17,649
I try.

2522
02:40:17,649 --> 02:40:20,649
I try to not say like filler.

2523
02:40:20,649 --> 02:40:21,649
Ah, there it is.

2524
02:40:21,649 --> 02:40:29,180
I try to not say filler words if I can help it.

2525
02:40:29,180 --> 02:40:34,799
I can't get down there without a ladder and I'd fall and break my legs and arms and knees

2526
02:40:34,799 --> 02:40:42,899
and my head and nostrils and fingers.

2527
02:40:42,899 --> 02:40:43,899
Break your nostrils.

2528
02:40:43,899 --> 02:40:48,600
All right.

2529
02:40:48,600 --> 02:40:50,479
So I need a ladder.

2530
02:40:50,479 --> 02:40:51,479
I can't do that yet.

2531
02:40:51,479 --> 02:40:59,059
What do I do with the shovel?

2532
02:40:59,059 --> 02:41:05,610
Hmm.

2533
02:41:05,610 --> 02:41:10,940
What did you want?

2534
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:17,110
Oh, the portrait.

2535
02:41:17,110 --> 02:41:23,639
So you're not going to believe this.

2536
02:41:23,639 --> 02:41:25,379
I believe it.

2537
02:41:25,379 --> 02:41:27,510
What is it?

2538
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:30,100
I meant to get you a portrait.

2539
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:32,299
Seriously?

2540
02:41:32,299 --> 02:41:33,299
Yep.

2541
02:41:33,299 --> 02:41:37,879
Pestle the panther saw your photo and he thought you were the perfect muse.

2542
02:41:37,879 --> 02:41:39,629
Get that?

2543
02:41:39,629 --> 02:41:41,639
How about me?

2544
02:41:41,639 --> 02:41:43,459
He sure did.

2545
02:41:43,459 --> 02:41:44,459
Can I?

2546
02:41:44,459 --> 02:41:45,459
Oh, I'm sorry.

2547
02:41:45,459 --> 02:41:46,459
Ow.

2548
02:41:46,459 --> 02:41:47,629
By the way, I'm moving my hands around.

2549
02:41:47,629 --> 02:41:48,940
I'm doing the thing.

2550
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:54,629
I'm putting my palms up, putting my right hand forward, back, putting both palms up, putting

2551
02:41:54,629 --> 02:41:59,219
right hand forward, right hand back, right hand forward, right hand back.

2552
02:41:59,219 --> 02:42:01,420
I have to do that.

2553
02:42:01,420 --> 02:42:06,090
My mouth is going like this and I'm putting my hands up and right now my right hand just

2554
02:42:06,090 --> 02:42:11,750
went up, forward and then back and then forward again.

2555
02:42:11,750 --> 02:42:15,299
I think you have to do that.

2556
02:42:15,299 --> 02:42:19,780
Doing a Trump impression, if I sit here and just do it without the motions, I won't be

2557
02:42:19,780 --> 02:42:27,159
able to do it.

2558
02:42:27,159 --> 02:42:36,079
Okay.

2559
02:42:36,079 --> 02:42:37,379
Let's hang it up.

2560
02:42:37,379 --> 02:42:38,690
Wow.

2561
02:42:38,690 --> 02:42:39,930
Wow.

2562
02:42:39,930 --> 02:42:41,229
It's huge.

2563
02:42:41,229 --> 02:42:42,469
This is huge.

2564
02:42:42,469 --> 02:42:43,469
Pistol is so talented.

2565
02:42:43,469 --> 02:42:46,309
How much do I owe him?

2566
02:42:46,309 --> 02:42:47,309
No charge.

2567
02:42:47,309 --> 02:42:48,670
He was just glad to be free of the witch's cyberspace curse.

2568
02:42:50,670 --> 02:42:52,299
Sorry.

2569
02:42:52,299 --> 02:42:53,299
What?

2570
02:42:53,299 --> 02:42:55,049
It's a whole thing.

2571
02:42:55,049 --> 02:42:56,049
Don't worry about it.

2572
02:42:56,049 --> 02:42:58,569
Painting isn't cursed, is it?

2573
02:42:58,569 --> 02:43:00,639
I don't think so.

2574
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:02,139
Well, good.

2575
02:43:02,139 --> 02:43:04,260
Thank you so much for getting this portrait for me, detective.

2576
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:05,750
Appreciate it.

2577
02:43:05,750 --> 02:43:09,459
It was no problem at all.

2578
02:43:09,459 --> 02:43:11,459
Well, frankly, it was huge.

2579
02:43:11,459 --> 02:43:12,459
What can I give you for the trouble?

2580
02:43:12,459 --> 02:43:13,459
Let me see.

2581
02:43:13,459 --> 02:43:14,459
Let me think.

2582
02:43:14,459 --> 02:43:16,590
Oh, I know.

2583
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:17,590
Take this ladder.

2584
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:21,709
There it is.

2585
02:43:21,709 --> 02:43:23,590
Nice.

2586
02:43:23,590 --> 02:43:25,729
Now we go down the well.

2587
02:43:25,729 --> 02:43:26,930
You barely notice you're holding it.

2588
02:43:26,930 --> 02:43:29,579
I promise.

2589
02:43:29,579 --> 02:43:30,579
If you say so.

2590
02:43:30,579 --> 02:43:32,200
Thanks.

2591
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:33,200
It's the best ladder.

2592
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:41,959
I fell asleep for a second.

2593
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:51,569
What's going on?

2594
02:43:51,569 --> 02:43:52,569
I think you missed a lot.

2595
02:43:52,569 --> 02:43:53,569
How long did you fall asleep for?

2596
02:43:53,569 --> 02:43:56,659
Yeah.

2597
02:43:56,659 --> 02:43:57,659
Good morning or good night.

2598
02:43:57,659 --> 02:43:58,659
Well, no.

2599
02:43:58,659 --> 02:44:01,309
You might have just taken a nap.

2600
02:44:01,309 --> 02:44:06,280
There have been tons of times where I've just kind of conked out for a little bit.

2601
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:07,280
20 minutes.

2602
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:18,569
30 minutes.

2603
02:44:18,569 --> 02:44:20,049
Hey, this ladder is perfect for climbing down as well.

2604
02:44:20,049 --> 02:44:23,909
Lucky me.

2605
02:44:23,909 --> 02:44:26,510
Ooh, a key.

2606
02:44:26,510 --> 02:44:28,389
We need it.

2607
02:44:28,389 --> 02:44:37,629
Close that book.

2608
02:44:37,629 --> 02:44:39,309
People are so careless nowadays.

2609
02:44:39,309 --> 02:44:40,309
Ever heard of a keychain?

2610
02:44:40,309 --> 02:44:42,260
I'll take this with me.

2611
02:44:42,260 --> 02:44:44,899
I got two items.

2612
02:44:44,899 --> 02:44:51,139
I can't nap.

2613
02:44:51,139 --> 02:44:54,809
I'm either awake or conked out for nine hours.

2614
02:44:54,809 --> 02:45:01,360
The problem that I have is I will put my head down and I will nap for 20 to 30 minutes.

2615
02:45:01,360 --> 02:45:03,600
I will wake up still lying down.

2616
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:11,340
My body will wake up and I'm so just so comfortable and so sleepy that I say to myself, I don't

2617
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:12,930
give a shit.

2618
02:45:12,930 --> 02:45:21,709
And then I close my eyes again and then I sleep for eight plus hours.

2619
02:45:21,709 --> 02:45:23,540
It's hard to nap.

2620
02:45:23,540 --> 02:45:28,049
Those of you that can actually get up, you are incredibly strong.

2621
02:45:28,049 --> 02:45:29,049
Don't ever think you're not.

2622
02:45:29,049 --> 02:45:30,350
I'm serious.

2623
02:45:30,350 --> 02:45:34,299
You were able to just get right up after taking a little nap.

2624
02:45:34,299 --> 02:45:37,420
You are very strong.

2625
02:45:37,420 --> 02:45:38,700
You're very strong, Will.

2626
02:45:38,700 --> 02:45:40,770
You do.

2627
02:45:40,770 --> 02:45:42,250
It's a really fucking hard thing to do.

2628
02:45:42,250 --> 02:45:58,459
Not only is this ladder perfect for climbing down, I can also see you going up there.

2629
02:45:58,459 --> 02:46:05,520
Lucky me.

2630
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:08,579
You just called me weak.

2631
02:46:08,579 --> 02:46:13,159
No, you're probably strong in other ways.

2632
02:46:13,159 --> 02:46:19,389
See?

2633
02:46:19,389 --> 02:46:24,770
Bro, I think you have sleep apnea.

2634
02:46:24,770 --> 02:46:33,829
I definitely don't have sleep apnea.

2635
02:46:33,829 --> 02:46:34,829
I don't think so.

2636
02:46:34,829 --> 02:46:42,280
All right.

2637
02:46:42,280 --> 02:46:43,280
We got the key.

2638
02:46:44,750 --> 02:46:46,430
I need to do something with the shovel.

2639
02:46:46,430 --> 02:46:52,100
OK, is the shovel a criminal tool?

2640
02:46:52,100 --> 02:47:00,219
Do I have everything that is that technically a criminal tool?

2641
02:47:00,219 --> 02:47:03,709
Now we need the fake ID.

2642
02:47:03,709 --> 02:47:04,709
All right.

2643
02:47:04,709 --> 02:47:06,079
So we need somebody to give it.

2644
02:47:06,079 --> 02:47:09,409
The fake ID comes from you.

2645
02:47:09,409 --> 02:47:17,100
We need a writing utensil for you.

2646
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:18,100
Is there somebody I didn't meet?

2647
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:25,659
What did I not meet?

2648
02:47:25,659 --> 02:47:26,659
The saloon?

2649
02:47:26,659 --> 02:47:28,219
Oh shit.

2650
02:47:28,219 --> 02:47:29,219
There is somebody at the saloon.

2651
02:47:29,219 --> 02:47:43,969
Oh, wait.

2652
02:47:43,969 --> 02:47:44,969
Isn't this Bernie?

2653
02:47:44,969 --> 02:47:45,969
This was original Bernie.

2654
02:47:56,620 --> 02:48:02,940
Why are you being captive?

2655
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:03,940
Be stiff?

2656
02:48:03,940 --> 02:48:04,940
Bad thing?

2657
02:48:04,940 --> 02:48:05,940
Perhaps?

2658
02:48:05,940 --> 02:48:07,760
Or who?

2659
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:11,059
I'm willing to determine such cruel and bad.

2660
02:48:11,059 --> 02:48:13,540
A stolen hat is a message.

2661
02:48:13,540 --> 02:48:16,620
Do not let yourself be shielded.

2662
02:48:16,620 --> 02:48:20,059
The light of the sun holds more answers than we think.

2663
02:48:20,059 --> 02:48:25,409
Answers to what?

2664
02:48:25,409 --> 02:48:27,930
Questions.

2665
02:48:27,930 --> 02:48:28,930
What questions?

2666
02:48:28,930 --> 02:48:32,909
Why is it so bright out here?

2667
02:48:32,909 --> 02:48:34,709
How do I charge?

2668
02:48:34,709 --> 02:48:38,469
Charge this solar-powered bobblehead and more.

2669
02:48:38,469 --> 02:48:41,409
I'm certain of it.

2670
02:48:41,409 --> 02:48:46,809
We spent so much time focused on how to find the missing hats, and no time considering

2671
02:48:46,809 --> 02:48:49,450
why we had them in the first place.

2672
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:50,450
Now who?

2673
02:48:50,450 --> 02:48:56,659
I would assume for sun protection.

2674
02:48:56,659 --> 02:48:58,540
Protection from the sun?

2675
02:48:58,540 --> 02:49:00,940
What harm does the sun pose to us?

2676
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:06,180
The sun can be bad for your skin.

2677
02:49:06,180 --> 02:49:08,819
If I stay in the sun too long, my skin goes all crispy.

2678
02:49:08,819 --> 02:49:11,799
I turn to a crispy fried snack.

2679
02:49:11,799 --> 02:49:16,500
Is being crispy wrong, detective?

2680
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:17,500
It's wrong for me.

2681
02:49:18,829 --> 02:49:23,110
Who are we to determine wrong and right?

2682
02:49:23,110 --> 02:49:25,309
I'm Frog Detective.

2683
02:49:25,309 --> 02:49:31,139
And I am just a lonely poet, trying to make sense of the world.

2684
02:49:31,139 --> 02:49:33,620
Nice to meet you.

2685
02:49:33,620 --> 02:49:35,340
And you?

2686
02:49:35,340 --> 02:49:40,120
This is like if you put the heavy his head under water.

2687
02:49:40,120 --> 02:49:43,440
You sure think a lot about things, huh?

2688
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:44,719
I try.

2689
02:49:44,719 --> 02:49:49,200
But I think I get it wrong a lot of the time.

2690
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:53,149
Who are we to determine wrong and right?

2691
02:49:53,149 --> 02:49:54,750
Ha ha ha ha!

2692
02:49:54,750 --> 02:49:57,510
I can do that better.

2693
02:49:57,510 --> 02:50:01,260
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2694
02:50:01,260 --> 02:50:03,389
Ha ha.

2695
02:50:03,389 --> 02:50:07,690
If you don't mind me saying, you don't look too much like a cowboy.

2696
02:50:07,690 --> 02:50:09,049
Oh, no.

2697
02:50:09,049 --> 02:50:10,969
Yes, I am no cowboy.

2698
02:50:10,969 --> 02:50:12,989
I am dusty.

2699
02:50:12,989 --> 02:50:19,180
I am an outlaw slash poet, trying to compose the perfect cowboy poem.

2700
02:50:19,180 --> 02:50:20,819
It's taking forever.

2701
02:50:20,819 --> 02:50:24,120
I am no good at this.

2702
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:26,670
But you have so much to say.

2703
02:50:26,670 --> 02:50:28,309
Yes, no.

2704
02:50:28,309 --> 02:50:31,030
But when I write it down, it gets so muddled.

2705
02:50:31,030 --> 02:50:32,229
That thing comes out right.

2706
02:50:32,950 --> 02:50:34,629
I'm eating my own throat.

2707
02:50:36,469 --> 02:50:38,299
I just swallowed.

2708
02:50:38,299 --> 02:50:40,780
And I swallowed the throat inside of my throat.

2709
02:50:40,780 --> 02:50:42,360
Hold on.

2710
02:50:42,360 --> 02:50:42,840
Give me a second.

2711
02:50:45,190 --> 02:50:54,600
How talented do you have to be to do that shit?

2712
02:50:54,600 --> 02:50:57,670
I'm sure it sounds great.

2713
02:50:57,670 --> 02:50:59,000
It doesn't.

2714
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:02,280
I am ashamed to even show anyone.

2715
02:51:02,280 --> 02:51:03,000
You can show me.

2716
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:03,719
I won't judge.

2717
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:05,829
Okay.

2718
02:51:10,860 --> 02:51:13,420
A cowboy's life is so much fun.

2719
02:51:13,420 --> 02:51:16,010
Sitting round on your bum.

2720
02:51:16,010 --> 02:51:17,450
Ride a scooter.

2721
02:51:17,450 --> 02:51:18,889
Sing a tune.

2722
02:51:18,889 --> 02:51:21,530
Say a yee-haw in the afternoon.

2723
02:51:21,530 --> 02:51:23,829
The sun is bright.

2724
02:51:23,829 --> 02:51:28,950
The smiles shine brighter when waving at this lonely rider.

2725
02:51:28,950 --> 02:51:32,309
I give a nod and a smile back too.

2726
02:51:32,309 --> 02:51:36,629
Yet I wish I could be someone new.

2727
02:51:36,629 --> 02:51:39,559
An outlaw's life is not for me.

2728
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:42,360
I want to ride and be carefree.

2729
02:51:47,139 --> 02:51:51,700
Instead, I sit and write stuff down, not fitting in with this cowboy town.

2730
02:51:51,700 --> 02:51:52,979
And I love cookies.

2731
02:51:56,579 --> 02:52:01,209
You're not rolling your R's.

2732
02:52:12,870 --> 02:52:13,909
It's beautiful.

2733
02:52:13,909 --> 02:52:18,229
I would say that's a perfect cowboy poem.

2734
02:52:18,229 --> 02:52:20,790
Thanks, but I think I want to write a new one.

2735
02:52:22,149 --> 02:52:23,350
Chocolate chip cookie.

2736
02:52:23,909 --> 02:52:27,049
Do you mind if I ask you some questions about the case?

2737
02:52:28,299 --> 02:52:29,260
Go ahead.

2738
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:37,260
Do you need help workshopping a perfect cowboy poem?

2739
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:42,409
I would love that.

2740
02:52:43,049 --> 02:52:44,729
Nobody here really gets to me.

2741
02:52:45,370 --> 02:52:46,090
You know?

2742
02:52:46,090 --> 02:52:46,649
That was better.

2743
02:52:47,979 --> 02:52:48,479
Totally.

2744
02:52:49,979 --> 02:52:52,379
I'll show you what I have so far.

2745
02:52:52,379 --> 02:52:54,459
And maybe you can help me finish it.

2746
02:52:56,020 --> 02:52:56,520
Sure.

2747
02:53:00,420 --> 02:53:01,940
I saw a cowboy eat a sna-

2748
02:53:03,219 --> 02:53:04,819
Okay, I have to change this.

2749
02:53:04,819 --> 02:53:06,020
I have to change this.

2750
02:53:06,020 --> 02:53:06,819
I have to change.

2751
02:53:06,819 --> 02:53:09,620
Before, like, I lose a hundred thousand followers.

2752
02:53:10,840 --> 02:53:12,680
I saw a cowboy eat a snack.

2753
02:53:12,680 --> 02:53:13,879
A bowl of cereal.

2754
02:53:13,879 --> 02:53:20,809
I saw a cowboy eat a snack, a bowl of cereal near the tracks.

2755
02:53:20,809 --> 02:53:21,770
From his sack.

2756
02:53:22,409 --> 02:53:23,049
Okay.

2757
02:53:23,049 --> 02:53:26,309
From his sack.

2758
02:53:26,309 --> 02:53:26,809
Nice.

2759
02:53:28,120 --> 02:53:29,959
I saw a cowboy eat a snack.

2760
02:53:29,959 --> 02:53:32,940
A bowl of cereal from his sack.

2761
02:53:32,940 --> 02:53:34,379
He finished quickly.

2762
02:53:34,379 --> 02:53:35,819
Smart and sure.

2763
02:53:35,819 --> 02:53:41,959
Then headed off to get some more.

2764
02:53:41,959 --> 02:53:42,920
Towards the store.

2765
02:53:42,920 --> 02:53:44,040
Cause he was bored.

2766
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:45,079
Towards the store.

2767
02:53:45,079 --> 02:53:45,559
Towards-

2768
02:53:45,559 --> 02:53:47,180
Towards the store.

2769
02:53:47,180 --> 02:53:48,780
Towards the store.

2770
02:53:48,780 --> 02:53:49,180
Wow.

2771
02:53:49,180 --> 02:53:49,979
I'm getting better.

2772
02:53:49,979 --> 02:53:56,920
He finished quickly.

2773
02:53:56,920 --> 02:53:57,559
Smart and sure.

2774
02:53:57,559 --> 02:53:58,280
Then he headed-

2775
02:53:58,280 --> 02:54:00,760
Then he headed off towards the store.

2776
02:54:00,760 --> 02:54:01,479
Sure.

2777
02:54:01,479 --> 02:54:01,959
Store.

2778
02:54:01,959 --> 02:54:02,520
More.

2779
02:54:02,520 --> 02:54:03,559
To get some more.

2780
02:54:03,559 --> 02:54:08,569
To get some more.

2781
02:54:08,569 --> 02:54:09,930
He finished quickly.

2782
02:54:09,930 --> 02:54:11,209
Smart and sure.

2783
02:54:11,290 --> 02:54:13,610
Then headed off to get some more.

2784
02:54:13,610 --> 02:54:16,700
But just ahead, to his shock.

2785
02:54:16,700 --> 02:54:22,629
There stood a newly built office block.

2786
02:54:22,629 --> 02:54:26,149
There was a Nessie from the lock.

2787
02:54:26,149 --> 02:54:27,989
He saw a goblin on a rock.

2788
02:54:27,989 --> 02:54:36,100
He saw a goblin on a rock.

2789
02:54:39,559 --> 02:54:41,030
Okay, sure.

2790
02:54:41,030 --> 02:54:46,229
But just ahead, to his shock, he saw a goblin on a rock.

2791
02:54:46,229 --> 02:54:57,299
He waddled over, concentrated face, only to discover.

2792
02:54:57,299 --> 02:54:59,860
Yeah, I did the voice crack on purpose.

2793
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:04,459
I'm glad you picked it up.

2794
02:55:04,459 --> 02:55:06,780
He waddled over, concentrated face, only to discover.

2795
02:55:08,659 --> 02:55:09,959
Face.

2796
02:55:09,959 --> 02:55:10,600
Nothing there.

2797
02:55:10,600 --> 02:55:11,799
Just empty space.

2798
02:55:11,799 --> 02:55:13,930
Trace.

2799
02:55:13,930 --> 02:55:19,559
Trace.

2800
02:55:19,559 --> 02:55:20,840
Intentional voice cracks.

2801
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:21,879
I figured it'd be kind of funny.

2802
02:55:25,079 --> 02:55:26,760
I'm going to say trace.

2803
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:27,159
Face.

2804
02:55:27,159 --> 02:55:27,799
Trace.

2805
02:55:27,799 --> 02:55:32,219
The thing had gone without a trace.

2806
02:55:34,229 --> 02:55:35,350
Thought twist.

2807
02:55:35,350 --> 02:55:36,440
Okay.

2808
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:38,840
He waddled over, concentrated face,

2809
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:42,440
only to discover the thing had gone without a trace.

2810
02:55:42,440 --> 02:55:45,479
The cowboy smiled and shook his head.

2811
02:55:45,479 --> 02:55:51,420
And off he went, feeling like an egghead.

2812
02:55:51,420 --> 02:55:55,399
You can't rhyme head with head.

2813
02:55:55,399 --> 02:55:58,780
Back to bed.

2814
02:55:58,780 --> 02:56:00,280
Back to bed.

2815
02:56:00,280 --> 02:56:02,360
Cowboy smiled and shook his head.

2816
02:56:02,360 --> 02:56:04,540
And off he went, back to bed.

2817
02:56:04,540 --> 02:56:05,500
Aha!

2818
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:06,540
It's perfect.

2819
02:56:06,540 --> 02:56:07,659
The perfect poem.

2820
02:56:07,659 --> 02:56:09,659
I can't wait to recite it in front of the crowd.

2821
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:12,600
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, detective.

2822
02:56:14,940 --> 02:56:15,899
It wasn't a problem at all.

2823
02:56:15,899 --> 02:56:17,180
I had lots of fun.

2824
02:56:17,180 --> 02:56:18,139
I'm becoming like German.

2825
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:22,780
I feel like I understand the cowboy life a bit better now.

2826
02:56:22,780 --> 02:56:24,780
I'm doing, I'm literally doing Arnold.

2827
02:56:24,780 --> 02:56:26,790
French.

2828
02:56:26,790 --> 02:56:29,989
Maybe one day I will feel confident enough to become one myself.

2829
02:56:30,549 --> 02:56:32,950
I wish you the best of luck.

2830
02:56:33,590 --> 02:56:34,870
Oh, thanks.

2831
02:56:34,870 --> 02:56:35,989
I appreciate it.

2832
02:56:37,370 --> 02:56:39,450
Hey, since I've written the perfect poem,

2833
02:56:39,450 --> 02:56:43,899
I don't need my writing supplies anymore.

2834
02:56:43,899 --> 02:56:44,700
Really?

2835
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:46,219
You don't want to write any more poems?

2836
02:56:47,459 --> 02:56:48,340
No, no, no, I do.

2837
02:56:48,340 --> 02:56:51,059
But every time I start to do a project,

2838
02:56:51,059 --> 02:56:53,379
I like to use new tools.

2839
02:56:54,389 --> 02:56:57,430
So I don't take the energy out of the old poem, no?

2840
02:56:57,430 --> 02:56:59,139
That sounds expensive.

2841
02:56:59,940 --> 02:57:00,260
Yes.

2842
02:57:00,819 --> 02:57:07,700
Anyway, detective, you suck.

2843
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:09,879
Stop that.

2844
02:57:09,879 --> 02:57:10,920
Don't stop saying that.

2845
02:57:10,920 --> 02:57:11,719
Stop being that person.

2846
02:57:11,719 --> 02:57:13,000
Time that person or ban that person.

2847
02:57:13,719 --> 02:57:15,219
Stop saying that about me.

2848
02:57:23,530 --> 02:57:23,850
All right.

2849
02:57:24,790 --> 02:57:25,030
All right.

2850
02:57:25,030 --> 02:57:25,670
We got everything.

2851
02:57:26,950 --> 02:57:27,909
You do that voice for too long.

2852
02:57:27,909 --> 02:57:28,709
It becomes your voice.

2853
02:57:39,319 --> 02:57:41,690
Okay.

2854
02:57:41,690 --> 02:57:42,889
Let's go get the ID.

2855
02:57:43,450 --> 02:57:48,469
All right.

2856
02:57:48,469 --> 02:57:49,030
Be honest.

2857
02:57:49,030 --> 02:57:50,729
I really want to know.

2858
02:57:50,729 --> 02:57:54,090
On a scale of zero to 10,

2859
02:57:54,090 --> 02:57:56,520
what would you write that heavy voice?

2860
02:57:57,719 --> 02:57:59,399
It's a very difficult voice to do.

2861
02:57:59,399 --> 02:58:00,600
You have to be incredibly talented.

2862
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:02,680
What would you actually give me like a real number?

2863
02:58:02,680 --> 02:58:03,239
Like six?

2864
02:58:03,879 --> 02:58:05,799
I think that was a solid six.

2865
02:58:06,520 --> 02:58:07,479
Like a 6.5.

2866
02:58:08,440 --> 02:58:09,559
At least, yeah, six or seven.

2867
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:10,920
I'll take a six.

2868
02:58:17,620 --> 02:58:19,700
Definitely need to work on the accent portion.

2869
02:58:19,700 --> 02:58:22,180
But I think if I really tried,

2870
02:58:22,180 --> 02:58:26,260
I could really get this part.

2871
02:58:26,260 --> 02:58:26,739
You know what I mean?

2872
02:58:26,739 --> 02:58:29,219
That exact tone.

2873
02:58:37,909 --> 02:58:38,229
All right.

2874
02:58:38,229 --> 02:58:39,350
Writing supplies.

2875
02:58:39,350 --> 02:58:43,590
I have some writing supplies right here.

2876
02:58:43,590 --> 02:58:45,909
How did you get those so quickly?

2877
02:58:45,909 --> 02:58:48,940
I helped you compose a beautiful poem.

2878
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:51,780
Sounds boring.

2879
02:58:51,780 --> 02:58:55,129
Well, thanks for getting those writing supplies for me.

2880
02:58:55,129 --> 02:58:56,170
I appreciate it.

2881
02:58:56,250 --> 02:58:59,209
If there's anything I can do for you, let me know.

2882
02:58:59,209 --> 02:59:00,520
I have a bunch of skills.

2883
02:59:01,239 --> 02:59:02,950
I wish I had a bunch of skills.

2884
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:05,579
We can't all be onto dynamite.

2885
02:59:05,579 --> 02:59:08,229
May I ask you some questions?

2886
02:59:09,559 --> 02:59:10,280
Fake ID.

2887
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:14,620
You mentioned you can forge identification, right?

2888
02:59:14,620 --> 02:59:16,200
I sure can.

2889
02:59:16,200 --> 02:59:18,299
I was wondering if you could help me.

2890
02:59:19,219 --> 02:59:19,940
Sure.

2891
02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:23,180
Anything for my friend, the detective.

2892
02:59:23,180 --> 02:59:23,579
Amazing.

2893
02:59:23,579 --> 02:59:26,059
I need to get a fake ID made for Susie.

2894
02:59:26,059 --> 02:59:26,540
Can you help?

2895
02:59:29,260 --> 02:59:30,860
Do you want to know what it's for?

2896
02:59:30,860 --> 02:59:34,180
I am not interested in other people's business.

2897
02:59:34,180 --> 02:59:36,739
I'll get that ready for you when it's your fee.

2898
02:59:36,739 --> 02:59:46,889
Oh, there goes Chad again.

2899
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:49,450
Being wicked sus.

2900
02:59:56,549 --> 02:59:57,510
That was hidden dialogue.

2901
02:59:57,510 --> 02:59:58,069
You didn't see that.

2902
02:59:59,030 --> 03:00:00,229
I had a hidden dialogue pop up.

2903
03:00:00,229 --> 03:00:01,350
That's why I said that.

2904
03:00:01,350 --> 03:00:03,030
There's some dialogue option popping up.

2905
03:00:03,030 --> 03:00:05,879
All right, I'm done.

2906
03:00:05,879 --> 03:00:07,319
Anything else I can help you with?

2907
03:00:07,319 --> 03:00:08,889
I think I'm good for now.

2908
03:00:08,889 --> 03:00:09,450
Thanks so much.

2909
03:00:13,260 --> 03:00:14,139
No worries, partner.

2910
03:00:17,819 --> 03:00:19,049
All right.

2911
03:00:19,049 --> 03:00:22,790
Now we bring the fake ID to...

2912
03:00:28,979 --> 03:00:33,290
Goes to the bank where the rabbit is.

2913
03:00:40,280 --> 03:00:41,639
Here is your fake ID.

2914
03:00:49,540 --> 03:00:51,299
Okay, so before I give you this,

2915
03:00:51,299 --> 03:00:53,700
just know that it just makes me very uncomfortable.

2916
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:56,120
But I know how important it is for me to solve this case

2917
03:00:56,120 --> 03:00:57,159
and impress the lobster cop.

2918
03:00:58,170 --> 03:01:00,329
So here's your fake ID.

2919
03:01:01,049 --> 03:01:04,120
Let's be on to it.

2920
03:01:04,120 --> 03:01:06,040
Yes, this rules.

2921
03:01:06,040 --> 03:01:07,079
It looks so realistic.

2922
03:01:08,219 --> 03:01:10,139
I don't think it looks realistic at all,

2923
03:01:10,139 --> 03:01:12,500
but it should be enough to get you in.

2924
03:01:12,500 --> 03:01:19,620
Okay, I'll be right back.

2925
03:01:19,620 --> 03:01:20,180
It worked.

2926
03:01:20,180 --> 03:01:20,899
Thanks, detective.

2927
03:01:21,459 --> 03:01:23,700
I'll be sure to tell everyone I know about how you helped me.

2928
03:01:24,790 --> 03:01:26,309
Oh, no, that's okay.

2929
03:01:26,309 --> 03:01:28,549
Don't tell anybody.

2930
03:01:28,549 --> 03:01:29,590
Hear ye, hear ye.

2931
03:01:29,590 --> 03:01:32,329
The detective helped me break into a bank.

2932
03:01:32,329 --> 03:01:33,370
No, no, no, no.

2933
03:01:33,370 --> 03:01:35,799
They should call you the burglar.

2934
03:01:35,799 --> 03:01:38,059
I do not want to be called that.

2935
03:01:38,059 --> 03:01:38,860
Fine, fine, fair here.

2936
03:01:38,860 --> 03:01:41,780
I got the map out for you.

2937
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:45,219
Crime map.

2938
03:01:45,219 --> 03:01:46,819
And I got my real ID out.

2939
03:01:46,819 --> 03:01:49,340
So I won't be breaking the rules anymore.

2940
03:01:49,340 --> 03:01:50,299
Glad to hear it.

2941
03:01:50,299 --> 03:01:50,940
Thanks for the map.

2942
03:01:50,940 --> 03:01:55,270
I think I'll be a big help.

2943
03:01:55,270 --> 03:01:56,659
Oh, wait.

2944
03:01:56,659 --> 03:01:58,780
I think that's everything.

2945
03:01:58,780 --> 03:02:01,020
Crime map, key, stew.

2946
03:02:01,020 --> 03:02:04,459
I think that's it.

2947
03:02:04,459 --> 03:02:05,219
Did I...

2948
03:02:05,219 --> 03:02:06,899
Can I go back to the cop now?

2949
03:02:06,899 --> 03:02:17,860
I think that's it.

2950
03:02:17,860 --> 03:02:18,739
Crime scene map.

2951
03:02:18,739 --> 03:02:19,540
Criminal tool...

2952
03:02:19,540 --> 03:02:22,360
The tool must be the shovel.

2953
03:02:22,360 --> 03:02:23,399
Is this a granny-like?

2954
03:02:23,399 --> 03:02:25,479
No, it is not.

2955
03:02:25,479 --> 03:02:29,319
A granny-like would have all of this stuff be in all these buildings

2956
03:02:29,319 --> 03:02:31,719
and have to do the same exact route.

2957
03:02:31,719 --> 03:02:34,780
But there's a person running 100 miles per hour behind me.

2958
03:02:34,780 --> 03:02:38,739
And if they touch me, the game's over.

2959
03:02:38,739 --> 03:02:40,180
So it's close.

2960
03:02:40,180 --> 03:02:49,450
All right, I have returned.

2961
03:02:49,450 --> 03:02:50,250
Here you go.

2962
03:02:50,250 --> 03:02:54,659
So are you finished?

2963
03:02:54,659 --> 03:02:55,690
Huh?

2964
03:02:55,690 --> 03:02:58,870
Did you find all the things I asked for?

2965
03:02:58,870 --> 03:03:01,430
I think so.

2966
03:03:01,430 --> 03:03:02,629
Ah, great initiative.

2967
03:03:02,629 --> 03:03:03,510
Let's take a look.

2968
03:03:03,510 --> 03:03:06,360
A map of the crime scene.

2969
03:03:06,360 --> 03:03:08,040
That looks like a map of the graveyard.

2970
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:11,159
Well, that could be it, but we'll have to wait and see.

2971
03:03:11,239 --> 03:03:14,120
A tool capable of aiding criminal activity.

2972
03:03:14,120 --> 03:03:15,079
Oh, a shovel.

2973
03:03:15,079 --> 03:03:17,719
I think you could be right, detective.

2974
03:03:17,719 --> 03:03:20,840
A key that will lead us to a clue.

2975
03:03:20,840 --> 03:03:22,360
That sure looks like a key to me.

2976
03:03:22,360 --> 03:03:24,309
Any idea where it could lead?

2977
03:03:24,309 --> 03:03:26,860
A meal for the number one best detective.

2978
03:03:26,860 --> 03:03:28,059
Oh, thank you very much.

2979
03:03:28,059 --> 03:03:32,059
As a number one best detective, this too is clearly for me.

2980
03:03:33,620 --> 03:03:34,739
Would you look at that?

2981
03:03:34,739 --> 03:03:36,020
The rookie came through.

2982
03:03:36,020 --> 03:03:38,440
Nice work, detective.

2983
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:39,479
Thank you, lobster cop.

2984
03:03:40,489 --> 03:03:42,409
Now you go ahead and check out the crime scene.

2985
03:03:42,409 --> 03:03:43,610
I'll be right behind.

2986
03:03:43,610 --> 03:03:46,329
I just have some quick business to attend to.

2987
03:03:46,329 --> 03:03:48,420
I can do that.

2988
03:03:48,420 --> 03:03:51,299
I'll take that meal now, though.

2989
03:03:53,399 --> 03:03:54,280
It's all yours.

2990
03:03:54,280 --> 03:03:55,000
Enjoy.

2991
03:03:55,000 --> 03:04:03,270
Otto's Big Adventure 2 voice?

2992
03:04:03,270 --> 03:04:03,750
Yeah.

2993
03:04:03,750 --> 03:04:11,379
He's free.

2994
03:04:11,379 --> 03:04:14,309
I don't.

2995
03:04:14,309 --> 03:04:14,870
Alrighty.

2996
03:04:15,430 --> 03:04:26,299
Well, here goes nothing.

2997
03:04:26,299 --> 03:04:29,020
You're too kind to be streaming just for me on my birthday.

2998
03:04:31,180 --> 03:04:35,500
Well, I didn't want to tell anybody because it was a surprise, but everybody,

2999
03:04:37,579 --> 03:04:42,219
Happy birthday to you.

3000
03:04:42,219 --> 03:04:42,700
There it is.

3001
03:04:43,780 --> 03:04:45,459
Happy birthday.

3002
03:04:55,899 --> 03:04:56,540
Just for you.

3003
03:05:08,360 --> 03:05:09,639
This is where the hats are hidden.

3004
03:05:09,639 --> 03:05:11,540
Are we going to see who did it?

3005
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:12,819
All right, chat.

3006
03:05:12,819 --> 03:05:18,440
Who do you guys think is the one that buried the hats here?

3007
03:05:19,159 --> 03:05:24,420
Oh, we got a raid.

3008
03:05:25,290 --> 03:05:26,729
Raid, raid, raid, raid.

3009
03:05:29,899 --> 03:05:32,139
Thank you, Vanya Laser.

3010
03:05:32,219 --> 03:05:34,709
I say your name wrong every single fucking time.

3011
03:05:38,819 --> 03:05:40,739
I can't talk properly.

3012
03:05:40,739 --> 03:05:42,340
I cannot talk properly.

3013
03:05:42,340 --> 03:05:48,069
But thanks to the raid.

3014
03:05:48,069 --> 03:05:48,790
Welcome.

3015
03:05:48,790 --> 03:05:51,540
How's everybody doing?

3016
03:05:51,540 --> 03:05:52,180
What were we doing?

3017
03:05:52,180 --> 03:05:54,100
What was going on in your stream?

3018
03:05:54,100 --> 03:05:56,860
Something fun.

3019
03:05:56,860 --> 03:06:00,309
Thanks to the raid, though.

3020
03:06:00,309 --> 03:06:02,260
Happy birthday song?

3021
03:06:02,260 --> 03:06:11,159
Was it your birthday?

3022
03:06:11,159 --> 03:06:11,559
No.

3023
03:06:11,559 --> 03:06:12,200
Oh, okay.

3024
03:06:13,799 --> 03:06:15,219
It's like, oh, shit.

3025
03:06:15,219 --> 03:06:15,459
All right.

3026
03:06:15,459 --> 03:06:17,639
It was your birthday today.

3027
03:06:17,639 --> 03:06:18,520
Oh, appreciate it.

3028
03:06:18,520 --> 03:06:19,579
Thank you.

3029
03:06:19,579 --> 03:06:20,700
We're playing Frog Detective.

3030
03:06:21,690 --> 03:06:24,540
I do want to say this is the final,

3031
03:06:24,540 --> 03:06:26,379
probably two minutes of this game.

3032
03:06:26,379 --> 03:06:29,500
So if you don't want to see a major spoiler for Frog Detective 3,

3033
03:06:29,500 --> 03:06:31,530
go ahead and close your eyes.

3034
03:06:31,530 --> 03:06:36,020
Here it comes.

3035
03:06:36,020 --> 03:06:36,979
Here we go.

3036
03:06:36,979 --> 03:06:41,379
I wish I could figure out the motive of this crime.

3037
03:06:41,379 --> 03:06:43,399
Does this make any sense?

3038
03:06:43,399 --> 03:06:44,120
Oh, well.

3039
03:06:44,120 --> 03:06:47,899
I'll just dig these up and hope Lobster Cop has more information.

3040
03:06:47,899 --> 03:06:58,010
What was that?

3041
03:06:58,010 --> 03:06:58,729
Great.

3042
03:06:58,729 --> 03:06:59,770
I found the hats.

3043
03:06:59,770 --> 03:07:03,000
I'm sure everyone will be so relieved to have them back.

3044
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:04,540
I'll take them back to town.

3045
03:07:07,079 --> 03:07:09,020
Why am I so gassy today?

3046
03:07:09,020 --> 03:07:10,979
It's insane.

3047
03:07:10,979 --> 03:07:14,100
It sure is nice to have a simple resolution to this mystery.

3048
03:07:14,100 --> 03:07:23,879
There are the hats.

3049
03:07:23,879 --> 03:07:26,649
Okay.

3050
03:07:26,649 --> 03:07:27,690
What happened?

3051
03:07:27,690 --> 03:07:29,899
Who did it?

3052
03:07:29,899 --> 03:07:32,340
Uh-oh.

3053
03:07:32,340 --> 03:07:32,819
Drama.

3054
03:07:40,780 --> 03:07:41,829
Oh, dear.

3055
03:07:41,829 --> 03:07:44,420
Good luck trying to remember what everybody sounded like.

3056
03:07:44,420 --> 03:07:46,629
Here comes the detective now.

3057
03:07:46,629 --> 03:07:48,870
Just in time for the town meeting to begin.

3058
03:07:48,870 --> 03:07:56,950
The first order of business is poem.

3059
03:07:56,950 --> 03:08:04,309
Please read poem.

3060
03:08:04,309 --> 03:08:05,270
Hello.

3061
03:08:05,270 --> 03:08:07,750
I would like to read you my poem.

3062
03:08:07,750 --> 03:08:12,229
This is my first time performing a poem and I am nervous.

3063
03:08:12,229 --> 03:08:13,670
Please do not laugh.

3064
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:21,020
I saw a cowboy eat a snack.

3065
03:08:21,500 --> 03:08:26,780
A bowl of cereal from his sack.

3066
03:08:26,780 --> 03:08:35,020
He finished quickly, smart and sure, then headed off to get some more.

3067
03:08:35,020 --> 03:08:40,309
But just ahead, to his shock, he saw a goblin on a rock.

3068
03:08:40,309 --> 03:08:54,200
He wandered over, concentrated face, only to discover the thing had gone without a trace.

3069
03:08:54,200 --> 03:08:59,479
The cowboy smiled and shook his head and off he went back to bed.

3070
03:08:59,479 --> 03:09:11,610
Great.

3071
03:09:11,610 --> 03:09:21,690
Thank you for the poem.

3072
03:09:21,690 --> 03:09:23,209
Next order of business.

3073
03:09:23,209 --> 03:09:23,930
Crime solved.

3074
03:09:25,190 --> 03:09:28,020
I am pleased to announce I have recovered.

3075
03:09:28,020 --> 03:09:30,680
Ah, let me stop you right there, detective.

3076
03:09:32,979 --> 03:09:37,379
I am pleased to announce I have found the culprit in the case of the missing hats.

3077
03:09:40,360 --> 03:09:45,799
I worked hard to cover this conclusion, so I trust I will have your full attention as

3078
03:09:45,799 --> 03:09:48,229
I go through the facts.

3079
03:09:48,229 --> 03:09:50,600
Please pay attention.

3080
03:09:50,600 --> 03:09:56,329
Earlier today, I had the pleasure of appointing Mason Mole as the title of sheriff.

3081
03:09:56,329 --> 03:09:58,389
Everybody likes this.

3082
03:09:58,389 --> 03:10:02,340
Yes, this is a universally loved decision.

3083
03:10:02,340 --> 03:10:05,340
Shortly after, the detective arrived.

3084
03:10:05,340 --> 03:10:06,219
That's me.

3085
03:10:06,219 --> 03:10:10,120
Quiet, please, detective.

3086
03:10:10,120 --> 03:10:17,659
Soon as the detective arrived, I'm sure you all noticed your hats went missing.

3087
03:10:17,659 --> 03:10:22,309
Wait, it is with great sadness that I have to tell you this.

3088
03:10:22,309 --> 03:10:28,760
The culprit of this crime, the hat-stealing monster of Cowboy County,

3089
03:10:28,760 --> 03:10:34,170
is none other than that second-best investigator, Frog the Detective.

3090
03:10:34,170 --> 03:10:37,879
Wait, what?

3091
03:10:37,879 --> 03:10:42,360
I've been presented a piece of evidence by our very own Mason Mole

3092
03:10:42,360 --> 03:10:44,680
that ties the detective to the crime.

3093
03:10:44,680 --> 03:10:46,069
What evidence?

3094
03:10:47,129 --> 03:10:47,930
This.

3095
03:10:47,930 --> 03:10:50,469
No, this is a mistake.

3096
03:10:50,469 --> 03:10:52,149
I was digging up the hats because I found it.

3097
03:10:52,149 --> 03:10:53,270
I found the hats.

3098
03:10:53,270 --> 03:10:56,840
And why do you look so mischievous?

3099
03:10:56,840 --> 03:10:57,239
I don't.

3100
03:10:57,239 --> 03:10:59,000
Someone draw eyebrows on me.

3101
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:00,180
I didn't have eyebrows.

3102
03:11:00,180 --> 03:11:01,299
I don't have them.

3103
03:11:01,299 --> 03:11:04,790
You have to admit, detective, you have a big motive.

3104
03:11:04,790 --> 03:11:05,930
A motive?

3105
03:11:05,930 --> 03:11:06,969
What happened?

3106
03:11:06,969 --> 03:11:12,020
You've come into a town that prides itself on hats.

3107
03:11:12,020 --> 03:11:15,379
Well-known fact that you cannot wear hats.

3108
03:11:15,379 --> 03:11:17,379
Weird head shape.

3109
03:11:17,379 --> 03:11:20,229
Yes, thank you, Sheriff Mason Mole.

3110
03:11:20,229 --> 03:11:23,540
Because of your weird head shape.

3111
03:11:23,540 --> 03:11:27,459
But I don't mind if other people wear hats.

3112
03:11:27,459 --> 03:11:30,299
Seems to me that you do, detective.

3113
03:11:30,299 --> 03:11:32,379
Why else would you steal the hats and hide them

3114
03:11:32,379 --> 03:11:34,299
where nobody would ever find them?

3115
03:11:34,299 --> 03:11:36,729
But I didn't, I swear.

3116
03:11:37,799 --> 03:11:39,239
Tell it to the judge.

3117
03:11:39,239 --> 03:11:40,579
What judge?

3118
03:11:44,149 --> 03:11:46,059
That's a good point.

3119
03:11:46,059 --> 03:11:49,739
We haven't seen a crime like this in our society before.

3120
03:11:49,739 --> 03:11:53,639
We'll have to invent a punishment.

3121
03:11:53,639 --> 03:11:55,350
I have an idea.

3122
03:11:55,350 --> 03:11:56,940
What is it?

3123
03:11:56,940 --> 03:11:57,659
Bad room.

3124
03:11:58,780 --> 03:11:59,500
What?

3125
03:12:00,200 --> 03:12:04,340
That's less of an idea and more of an ominous concept.

3126
03:12:04,340 --> 03:12:05,620
I will elaborate.

3127
03:12:05,620 --> 03:12:07,620
We put Frog Detective in the bad room.

3128
03:12:07,620 --> 03:12:10,420
A punishment of crime.

3129
03:12:10,420 --> 03:12:13,239
No.

3130
03:12:13,239 --> 03:12:16,760
An excellent if shocking idea, Sheriff Mason Mole.

3131
03:12:16,760 --> 03:12:20,540
We will construct the bad room at once.

3132
03:12:20,540 --> 03:12:21,659
I already made it.

3133
03:12:21,659 --> 03:12:24,520
It's in my office.

3134
03:12:24,520 --> 03:12:26,280
Oh, well, in that case.

3135
03:12:26,280 --> 03:12:32,819
Detective, I sentence you to one year of living in the bad room.

3136
03:12:32,819 --> 03:12:37,510
This is the worst day of my life.

3137
03:12:37,510 --> 03:12:46,059
No, somebody help.

3138
03:12:46,059 --> 03:12:46,559
Revenge.

3139
03:12:55,930 --> 03:12:56,889
How could they?

3140
03:12:56,889 --> 03:13:12,309
How could they?

3141
03:13:12,309 --> 03:13:13,030
What?

3142
03:13:13,030 --> 03:13:15,100
Is that actually a bad end?

3143
03:13:19,459 --> 03:13:20,340
Wait, what?

3144
03:13:22,549 --> 03:13:23,670
That's such a...

3145
03:13:23,670 --> 03:13:24,950
That's so sad.

3146
03:13:24,950 --> 03:13:26,149
That's a bad ending, right?

3147
03:13:26,149 --> 03:13:27,270
That's the worst ending.

3148
03:13:27,270 --> 03:13:33,799
You just get arrested and framed for a crime and they just lock you up.

3149
03:13:35,879 --> 03:13:36,760
Yeah, that's a bad ending.

3150
03:13:41,290 --> 03:13:41,790
Oh, no.

3151
03:13:42,969 --> 03:13:45,750
That might not be the end.

3152
03:13:47,030 --> 03:13:55,270
You need to go fix it.

3153
03:13:58,920 --> 03:13:59,420
Oh, wait.

3154
03:14:00,040 --> 03:14:02,549
Is this a setup for Frog Detective 4?

3155
03:14:04,629 --> 03:14:06,500
This is a series, right?

3156
03:14:12,440 --> 03:14:13,239
You need to fix this.

3157
03:14:19,219 --> 03:14:20,760
What did I do out of?

3158
03:14:20,760 --> 03:14:21,799
Did I do something out of order?

3159
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:32,299
Yeah, this is episode three.

3160
03:14:33,020 --> 03:14:37,739
What?

3161
03:14:37,739 --> 03:14:40,139
We don't have anyone else to credit and there's still time left.

3162
03:14:40,139 --> 03:14:44,940
The following credits are from Degrassi, the next generation, season six, episode 11.

3163
03:14:49,739 --> 03:14:50,239
Huh?

3164
03:15:02,540 --> 03:15:03,100
Okay.

3165
03:15:03,100 --> 03:15:06,620
Well, this is a job on that on that show.

3166
03:15:07,979 --> 03:15:10,409
This is a pretty good bit.

3167
03:15:10,409 --> 03:15:10,909
Yeah, it is.

3168
03:15:11,770 --> 03:15:12,409
That's a good bit.

3169
03:15:16,309 --> 03:15:17,350
He is so sad in there.

3170
03:15:17,350 --> 03:15:17,909
That's not fair.

3171
03:15:19,270 --> 03:15:26,309
I think it's because you uninstalled the first two games.

3172
03:15:34,010 --> 03:15:34,649
Really?

3173
03:15:34,649 --> 03:15:37,430
Well, let's see.

3174
03:15:45,299 --> 03:15:46,100
Fake fan.

3175
03:15:46,100 --> 03:15:46,739
Fake fan.

3176
03:15:47,540 --> 03:15:48,709
All right, let's see.

3177
03:15:48,709 --> 03:15:49,209
Hold on a second.

3178
03:15:49,909 --> 03:15:51,879
What happens now?

3179
03:15:59,879 --> 03:16:28,469
Are we going to reach out to somebody?

3180
03:16:53,239 --> 03:17:06,899
Oh, frogdetective.net slash blog dot html to my loyal frog blog readers.

3181
03:17:06,899 --> 03:17:11,049
It's our number one of my time in the bad room.

3182
03:17:11,049 --> 03:17:14,659
I know that I am innocent.

3183
03:17:14,659 --> 03:17:18,260
Unfortunately, because the number one best detective put me in here,

3184
03:17:18,899 --> 03:17:22,010
nobody will believe me.

3185
03:17:22,010 --> 03:17:24,329
That's what you get being second best.

3186
03:17:24,329 --> 03:17:32,979
I'm not sure anybody reads my frog blog anymore because of my alleged crimes.

3187
03:17:32,979 --> 03:17:35,129
But if you are reading, thank you.

3188
03:17:35,700 --> 03:17:39,780
I hope to prove my innocence in the case of the hat theft

3189
03:17:39,780 --> 03:17:43,459
and return to being as good of a detective as I can be.

3190
03:17:43,459 --> 03:17:49,180
I'm not sure why Sheriff Mason Mole has framed me,

3191
03:17:49,180 --> 03:17:53,620
but my hope is that it's all just one big misunderstanding,

3192
03:17:53,620 --> 03:17:59,110
as is the case with most of the mysteries I am involved in.

3193
03:17:59,110 --> 03:18:05,079
It would really hurt my feelings to know that he did this on purpose.

3194
03:18:05,079 --> 03:18:08,790
What the fuck is with my gassy body?

3195
03:18:08,870 --> 03:18:12,709
I'm grateful that Loftacop has given me access to a computer

3196
03:18:12,709 --> 03:18:16,979
so I can continue to write my blog post.

3197
03:18:16,979 --> 03:18:24,729
Though I must say, I'm not sure I have much to write about here.

3198
03:18:24,729 --> 03:18:27,020
Thank you for reading.

3199
03:18:27,020 --> 03:18:29,190
Frog Detective X.

3200
03:18:29,190 --> 03:18:42,409
Oh, somebody's going to read the blog and go get them.

3201
03:18:42,409 --> 03:18:43,930
This is terrible.

3202
03:18:44,819 --> 03:18:46,260
I can't believe this.

3203
03:18:48,629 --> 03:18:49,510
What's going on?

3204
03:18:50,149 --> 03:18:52,469
I'm reading the latest frog blog post.

3205
03:18:52,469 --> 03:18:56,069
I was excited to see how I was addicted to solving the mystery in Cowboy County,

3206
03:18:56,069 --> 03:18:57,270
but I can't believe it.

3207
03:18:57,270 --> 03:18:59,270
The detective has been framed for a crime.

3208
03:19:01,139 --> 03:19:02,020
Crime is real?

3209
03:19:02,819 --> 03:19:04,579
Let's not jump to any conclusions here.

3210
03:19:06,680 --> 03:19:07,719
Of course, sorry.

3211
03:19:08,540 --> 03:19:09,659
What do we do, Moe?

3212
03:19:11,319 --> 03:19:14,139
Um, we get back to our science work?

3213
03:19:15,020 --> 03:19:18,780
I can't possibly concentrate on scientific discoveries in these conditions.

3214
03:19:19,659 --> 03:19:21,739
Moe, I have to help the detective.

3215
03:19:23,479 --> 03:19:30,629
How are you going to do that?

3216
03:19:30,629 --> 03:19:59,559
I'll have to solve the mystery myself.

3217
03:19:59,559 --> 03:20:02,940
But now it's not Frog Detective anymore.

3218
03:20:02,940 --> 03:20:03,180
It's...

3219
03:20:03,819 --> 03:20:14,600
Look out, little Moe.

3220
03:20:14,600 --> 03:20:17,639
I'm not coming back until I've proven the detective innocent.

3221
03:20:20,459 --> 03:20:22,379
Wow, Mystery Monkey is so cool.

3222
03:20:27,979 --> 03:20:34,579
Well, it's not over.

3223
03:20:34,579 --> 03:20:36,950
There's still some more.

3224
03:20:36,950 --> 03:20:38,069
New protagonist.

3225
03:20:38,069 --> 03:20:43,989
Can I help you?

3226
03:20:43,989 --> 03:20:45,989
Hi, Supervisor.

3227
03:20:45,989 --> 03:20:47,829
My name is Mystery Monkey.

3228
03:20:47,829 --> 03:20:52,870
We talked on the phone a while back about the mystery of the haunted island.

3229
03:20:52,870 --> 03:20:56,090
Of course, but how could I forget?

3230
03:20:56,090 --> 03:20:57,879
It's good to see you.

3231
03:20:57,879 --> 03:21:00,389
Likewise.

3232
03:21:00,389 --> 03:21:06,389
I realize this is highly unusual, but I'm here about one of your detectives.

3233
03:21:06,389 --> 03:21:10,709
Uh, is it Lobster Cop?

3234
03:21:11,510 --> 03:21:11,829
No.

3235
03:21:14,700 --> 03:21:15,739
Investigator Eel?

3236
03:21:16,549 --> 03:21:16,790
No.

3237
03:21:17,350 --> 03:21:22,020
Inspector Iguana, the incredible Sandy Moth P.I.?

3238
03:21:22,020 --> 03:21:23,780
No, it's none of those.

3239
03:21:27,690 --> 03:21:32,059
Uh, I'm here about Frog Detective.

3240
03:21:35,100 --> 03:21:37,579
Oh, of course, our second best detective.

3241
03:21:37,579 --> 03:21:41,639
Well, the detective isn't around right now.

3242
03:21:41,639 --> 03:21:46,600
Sent my two top investigators to help cover in Cowboy County.

3243
03:21:46,600 --> 03:21:47,879
You haven't heard.

3244
03:21:47,879 --> 03:21:49,780
Heard what?

3245
03:21:50,899 --> 03:21:55,620
The detective has been framed for a crime over in Cowboy County.

3246
03:21:58,020 --> 03:21:58,899
Terrible news.

3247
03:21:58,899 --> 03:22:01,510
How can you be so sure it's a setup?

3248
03:22:01,510 --> 03:22:03,670
The story doesn't add up.

3249
03:22:03,670 --> 03:22:13,129
And I know Frog Detective would never do something so horrible as steal the town's hats.

3250
03:22:13,129 --> 03:22:15,260
Well, there is a clear motive there.

3251
03:22:15,260 --> 03:22:18,860
I know, I know, but it's so out of character.

3252
03:22:18,860 --> 03:22:22,780
Even if the detective is guilty, the punishment is really harsh.

3253
03:22:22,780 --> 03:22:26,360
The detective has been sent to the bad room.

3254
03:22:26,360 --> 03:22:30,329
Oh, no.

3255
03:22:30,329 --> 03:22:32,540
What's the bad room?

3256
03:22:32,540 --> 03:22:36,340
It's something that Sheriff Mason Mole invented.

3257
03:22:36,340 --> 03:22:37,379
Mason Mole?

3258
03:22:37,379 --> 03:22:39,319
That name sounds familiar.

3259
03:22:39,319 --> 03:22:39,959
Oh?

3260
03:22:39,959 --> 03:22:45,590
I've seen him around before, just sort of loitering around the offices.

3261
03:22:45,590 --> 03:22:48,059
Loitering, you say?

3262
03:22:48,059 --> 03:22:54,299
I remember a kind of shady guy hanging around on Martins Island back when we were there

3263
03:22:54,379 --> 03:23:01,239
to investigate the ghost noises, mixing up a lot of different things at the same time.

3264
03:23:01,239 --> 03:23:04,819
But I'm still trying my hardest, Arthur.

3265
03:23:04,819 --> 03:23:09,299
He arrived shortly before the detective, but I didn't get a chance to catch his name.

3266
03:23:09,299 --> 03:23:12,120
He didn't even say hello.

3267
03:23:12,120 --> 03:23:17,319
When I saw his photo on the Frog blog, I knew he ran away something was amiss.

3268
03:23:17,319 --> 03:23:21,659
Great detective skills, Mystery Monkey.

3269
03:23:21,659 --> 03:23:27,110
I know it's a big ask, but do you mind if I snoop around in Frog Detective's office

3270
03:23:27,110 --> 03:23:28,389
to look for clues?

3271
03:23:28,389 --> 03:23:30,549
Be my guest.

3272
03:23:32,700 --> 03:23:37,620
Okay, somebody said who said Kenneth Copeland?

3273
03:23:47,370 --> 03:23:48,409
Okay, let's go.

3274
03:23:48,409 --> 03:23:58,780
I shouldn't snoop in Lobster Cop's office unless I really have to.

3275
03:23:58,780 --> 03:24:04,459
What's in here?

3276
03:24:04,459 --> 03:24:10,100
Clue detecting powder.

3277
03:24:10,100 --> 03:24:11,129
How convenient.

3278
03:24:11,129 --> 03:24:18,950
I'll just spread this powder around and take another look.

3279
03:24:18,950 --> 03:24:20,149
It was your mod?

3280
03:24:20,149 --> 03:24:34,549
Oh, it went by too fast.

3281
03:24:34,549 --> 03:24:38,309
My god, what's that?

3282
03:24:39,350 --> 03:24:46,709
That's a clue.

3283
03:24:46,709 --> 03:25:06,579
Oh, wait a minute.

3284
03:25:08,280 --> 03:25:08,840
Wait a minute.

3285
03:25:18,889 --> 03:25:19,450
Wait a minute.

3286
03:25:25,180 --> 03:25:27,379
Wait a second.

3287
03:25:27,379 --> 03:25:28,260
Wait a second.

3288
03:25:28,260 --> 03:25:31,639
Oh, I couldn't be.

3289
03:25:31,639 --> 03:25:42,420
People walk in here all the time?

3290
03:25:42,420 --> 03:25:50,520
Yeah, that's true.

3291
03:25:50,520 --> 03:25:51,319
Uh oh.

3292
03:25:51,319 --> 03:25:57,620
The Lobster Cop be hiding.

3293
03:25:57,620 --> 03:25:58,819
What are you doing?

3294
03:25:58,819 --> 03:26:00,659
Why did he do that?

3295
03:26:06,149 --> 03:26:08,389
Copy of the detective's notebook.

3296
03:26:12,219 --> 03:26:15,180
Lobster Cop and Mason Mole.

3297
03:26:19,079 --> 03:26:24,649
Note, it reads, hello Lobster Cop.

3298
03:26:24,649 --> 03:26:26,969
It's me, your bestie forever, Mason Mole.

3299
03:26:27,610 --> 03:26:28,809
I've done what you asked.

3300
03:26:30,280 --> 03:26:34,040
Not easy to trail the detective unnoticed, but I think I did a great job.

3301
03:26:34,920 --> 03:26:38,840
I fear that your suspicions are correct and that frog detective is on the right track

3302
03:26:38,840 --> 03:26:41,719
to overtaking your position as number one best detective.

3303
03:26:41,719 --> 03:26:46,280
You can keep pretending to solve mysteries instead of actually solving them.

3304
03:26:46,280 --> 03:26:48,680
The supervisor will eventually notice.

3305
03:26:48,680 --> 03:26:52,729
So I've taken the detective's notebook inside.

3306
03:26:52,729 --> 03:26:55,850
There's some great insights on how the detective works through a case.

3307
03:26:56,569 --> 03:27:00,520
Maybe you can read and learn, but it may not be enough.

3308
03:27:01,620 --> 03:27:06,180
As the detective gets better and better, your position as number one is threatened.

3309
03:27:06,180 --> 03:27:10,100
It's time to enact the plan.

3310
03:27:11,299 --> 03:27:15,860
Came up with, it's devious and mean and not very nice.

3311
03:27:16,579 --> 03:27:21,780
But if you want to be the best, you'll have to get rid of the best.

3312
03:27:21,780 --> 03:27:30,649
This can't be true.

3313
03:27:31,590 --> 03:27:34,229
Lobster Cop, number one best detective, a fraud?

3314
03:27:34,790 --> 03:27:45,100
I mean, to get the supervisor and head to Cowboy County, there's been a terrible misjustice.

3315
03:27:45,100 --> 03:27:45,979
Let's go.

3316
03:27:45,979 --> 03:27:46,860
Let's go.

3317
03:27:46,860 --> 03:27:47,579
Let's go.

3318
03:27:47,579 --> 03:28:00,799
Okay.

3319
03:28:02,090 --> 03:28:03,209
Where, where are you?

3320
03:28:04,250 --> 03:28:04,750
I'm coming.

3321
03:28:12,120 --> 03:28:19,239
What's up?

3322
03:28:19,239 --> 03:28:22,700
Howdy, folks.

3323
03:28:22,700 --> 03:28:26,790
What brings you to Cowboy County so late?

3324
03:28:26,790 --> 03:28:29,190
This is our turf.

3325
03:28:29,190 --> 03:28:31,209
You better have good food.

3326
03:28:31,209 --> 03:28:32,569
We don't want any trouble.

3327
03:28:33,209 --> 03:28:35,739
We're here about our good friend, the frog detective.

3328
03:28:37,620 --> 03:28:38,819
The duality of frog.

3329
03:28:39,379 --> 03:28:41,700
How can one be so kind, poetic, and thoughtful?

3330
03:28:42,579 --> 03:28:45,379
Also, be a stealer of our hats.

3331
03:28:45,379 --> 03:28:50,950
I forgot who, what do you sound like?

3332
03:28:51,030 --> 03:28:54,469
Frog's so pretty, so alluring, and yet.

3333
03:28:54,469 --> 03:28:55,829
What does this person sound like?

3334
03:28:55,829 --> 03:29:00,489
You really, I really trusted frog detective.

3335
03:29:00,489 --> 03:29:01,049
That snake.

3336
03:29:01,690 --> 03:29:04,729
I can't go on a date with a criminal.

3337
03:29:04,729 --> 03:29:05,530
That's just not me.

3338
03:29:06,840 --> 03:29:09,399
I, aren't you a bandit?

3339
03:29:10,040 --> 03:29:12,440
I'm outlawed.

3340
03:29:12,440 --> 03:29:14,600
So you live outside the law.

3341
03:29:16,250 --> 03:29:18,969
Well, when there's no laws, it makes it pretty easy.

3342
03:29:20,360 --> 03:29:22,360
It doesn't matter anyway.

3343
03:29:22,360 --> 03:29:25,239
Frog detective is innocent.

3344
03:29:25,239 --> 03:29:27,299
Sure.

3345
03:29:27,299 --> 03:29:30,219
We all saw the photo.

3346
03:29:30,219 --> 03:29:32,219
Those furrowed brows tell the whole story.

3347
03:29:33,350 --> 03:29:36,950
Frog detective doesn't even have eyebrows.

3348
03:29:40,040 --> 03:29:41,159
So those were stolen too.

3349
03:29:42,940 --> 03:29:44,139
Oh, you're mistaken.

3350
03:29:44,139 --> 03:29:47,690
Mystery Monkey found all the evidence.

3351
03:29:47,690 --> 03:29:48,649
Who's mystery monkey?

3352
03:29:49,590 --> 03:29:50,389
That's me.

3353
03:29:50,389 --> 03:29:55,030
You may have read my comments before on frog detective's frog blog.

3354
03:29:55,030 --> 03:29:56,790
I'm a pretty active user.

3355
03:29:58,860 --> 03:29:59,819
Blogs are still a thing?

3356
03:30:01,479 --> 03:30:03,479
Regardless, you say it was a mistake.

3357
03:30:04,600 --> 03:30:06,120
Not so much a mistake.

3358
03:30:06,760 --> 03:30:14,120
A sit up, a sit up, a sit up, a sit up, a sit up, a sit up.

3359
03:30:14,120 --> 03:30:15,610
Better?

3360
03:30:15,610 --> 03:30:22,969
I have reason to believe Sheriff Mason Mole and lobster cop coordinated the takedown

3361
03:30:22,969 --> 03:30:24,809
of our beloved frog detective.

3362
03:30:29,260 --> 03:30:30,139
That's so messed up.

3363
03:30:31,620 --> 03:30:33,459
Who would do that to such a beautiful frog?

3364
03:30:34,819 --> 03:30:37,059
Someone very jealous, I'm afraid.

3365
03:30:37,780 --> 03:30:39,510
How can we help?

3366
03:30:40,579 --> 03:30:44,500
If you can point us in the direction of where frog detective is being held,

3367
03:30:45,459 --> 03:30:46,340
that would help a lot.

3368
03:30:49,020 --> 03:30:49,739
Easy.

3369
03:30:49,739 --> 03:30:52,540
Sheriff Mason Mole has the detective locked up in bad room.

3370
03:31:01,690 --> 03:31:02,489
I just didn't want to...

3371
03:31:02,489 --> 03:31:05,909
I burped off camera.

3372
03:31:05,909 --> 03:31:06,790
You're quiet.

3373
03:31:06,790 --> 03:31:08,489
You should be able to sneak in without trouble.

3374
03:31:09,610 --> 03:31:11,129
Thanks for your help bandits.

3375
03:31:12,260 --> 03:31:15,940
I am now going to change the voice of this character

3376
03:31:16,659 --> 03:31:19,860
because it's kind of hard to do after so long.

3377
03:31:20,579 --> 03:31:23,700
They will now sound better and different than this.

3378
03:31:24,659 --> 03:31:28,340
Okay Arthur, I'm changing it to something else.

3379
03:31:31,079 --> 03:31:31,639
My bad.

3380
03:31:32,200 --> 03:31:40,520
He's decomposing.

3381
03:31:42,200 --> 03:31:51,479
Can I sneak in?

3382
03:31:51,479 --> 03:31:53,559
I said to sneak in, right?

3383
03:31:53,559 --> 03:32:05,030
Mystery Monkey?

3384
03:32:05,590 --> 03:32:06,229
Supervisor?

3385
03:32:06,790 --> 03:32:07,829
What are you doing here?

3386
03:32:08,549 --> 03:32:11,270
I didn't know I was allowed visitors in bad room.

3387
03:32:11,270 --> 03:32:12,709
I didn't anyone would want to visit me.

3388
03:32:13,430 --> 03:32:18,870
We're here to...

3389
03:32:18,870 --> 03:32:19,510
That's even worse.

3390
03:32:19,510 --> 03:32:20,549
No, we're here.

3391
03:32:21,530 --> 03:32:23,450
We're here to bust you out.

3392
03:32:25,459 --> 03:32:26,020
What?

3393
03:32:26,020 --> 03:32:28,739
Mystery Monkey has proof you were framed.

3394
03:32:29,459 --> 03:32:30,020
I knew it.

3395
03:32:30,020 --> 03:32:31,379
Sheriff Mason Mole was up to something.

3396
03:32:31,940 --> 03:32:34,250
Not just him detective.

3397
03:32:34,889 --> 03:32:36,569
I'm sorry to tell you I believe

3398
03:32:37,450 --> 03:32:41,739
Lobster Cop and Mason Mole planned this all along.

3399
03:32:44,540 --> 03:32:45,100
It can't be.

3400
03:32:46,059 --> 03:32:47,899
Lobster Cop is number one best detective.

3401
03:32:47,899 --> 03:32:49,100
Why would he try to frame me?

3402
03:32:50,440 --> 03:32:52,280
Hard to know for sure until we ask.

3403
03:32:52,280 --> 03:32:55,639
But it looks like Lobster Cop has been dealing with a bad case of jealousy.

3404
03:32:57,139 --> 03:32:59,780
Green with envy one might say.

3405
03:33:03,540 --> 03:33:04,500
Envious of who?

3406
03:33:08,329 --> 03:33:09,770
You detective.

3407
03:33:10,409 --> 03:33:11,850
They're talking about you.

3408
03:33:12,569 --> 03:33:14,459
It's not possible.

3409
03:33:15,020 --> 03:33:17,799
It's time to shift your understanding of the world detective.

3410
03:33:18,360 --> 03:33:21,479
Not everyone is out to do a good job and solve mysteries like you.

3411
03:33:23,260 --> 03:33:24,540
I simply can't believe it.

3412
03:33:25,739 --> 03:33:26,379
Well, let's...

3413
03:33:27,180 --> 03:33:31,180
I keep hitting the microphone and I'm sorry that I do that.

3414
03:33:31,180 --> 03:33:31,819
But we...

3415
03:33:31,819 --> 03:33:35,420
Let's wait until dawn and confront Lobster Cop and Mason Mole.

3416
03:33:36,360 --> 03:33:37,479
Once and for all.

3417
03:33:38,120 --> 03:33:40,729
The sun is coming up as we speak.

3418
03:33:40,729 --> 03:33:41,690
I'll call a town meeting.

3419
03:33:49,700 --> 03:33:53,420
Jeremy, you're turning into voice soup.

3420
03:33:53,420 --> 03:33:54,459
Uh oh, here we go.

3421
03:33:54,459 --> 03:33:59,399
What is the meaning of this?

3422
03:34:00,600 --> 03:34:02,280
Only I get to call town meetings.

3423
03:34:03,350 --> 03:34:07,430
I have called this town meeting for a very important purpose.

3424
03:34:08,229 --> 03:34:11,270
I have some news about the hat stealing case.

3425
03:34:12,780 --> 03:34:14,459
But it's closed.

3426
03:34:14,459 --> 03:34:15,260
I solved it.

3427
03:34:16,299 --> 03:34:17,659
Is that so Lobster Cop?

3428
03:34:19,159 --> 03:34:21,559
Supervisor, what are you doing here?

3429
03:34:21,559 --> 03:34:24,250
Please give your attention to Mystery Monkey for just a moment.

3430
03:34:25,319 --> 03:34:27,000
Thank you, Supervisor.

3431
03:34:27,559 --> 03:34:30,760
Yank you town for meeting us on such short notice.

3432
03:34:31,479 --> 03:34:35,319
Sheriff Mason Mole, I have an important question to ask you.

3433
03:34:37,209 --> 03:34:37,850
What?

3434
03:34:37,850 --> 03:34:43,510
How long have you and Lobster Cop been scheming to bring down Frog Detective?

3435
03:34:45,959 --> 03:34:46,600
Huh?

3436
03:34:46,600 --> 03:34:46,920
What?

3437
03:34:48,760 --> 03:34:49,940
This is ridiculous.

3438
03:34:50,819 --> 03:34:54,659
Lobster Cop, I found the secret drawer in your office.

3439
03:34:56,680 --> 03:34:58,440
You can't just go through my office.

3440
03:34:58,440 --> 03:34:59,079
That's a crime.

3441
03:35:00,020 --> 03:35:02,739
Please stop trying to invent crimes.

3442
03:35:02,739 --> 03:35:04,260
Crime is not real.

3443
03:35:05,450 --> 03:35:09,290
As I was saying, I found your secret drawer.

3444
03:35:09,290 --> 03:35:12,250
I found the letter that Mason Mole wrote to you.

3445
03:35:13,959 --> 03:35:16,360
I knew I shouldn't have detailed my schemes on paper.

3446
03:35:18,170 --> 03:35:22,170
Sheriff Mason Mole has been tailing the detective since I called for help

3447
03:35:22,170 --> 03:35:25,530
with the mystery of the haunted island, Arthur.

3448
03:35:26,549 --> 03:35:31,670
As the lead scientist on the island at the time, I can confirm I had several reports

3449
03:35:31,750 --> 03:35:37,020
sightings of Mason Mole sneaking around like a slippery snake.

3450
03:35:37,020 --> 03:35:38,620
Wait, why didn't you tell me?

3451
03:35:38,620 --> 03:35:42,440
There's like someone sneaking around the island is kind of relevant to that case.

3452
03:35:44,170 --> 03:35:46,409
I was too starstruck.

3453
03:35:47,209 --> 03:35:52,250
In any case, I contacted my friend Carlos who runs the shop over in Warlock Woods.

3454
03:35:52,809 --> 03:35:56,729
He also confirmed a sighting of Mason Mole hiding behind his shop.

3455
03:36:01,899 --> 03:36:02,940
Oh, but you did.

3456
03:36:04,059 --> 03:36:07,819
Sheriff Mason Mole, I have reason to believe you were hired by Lobster Cop

3457
03:36:07,819 --> 03:36:08,860
to follow the detective.

3458
03:36:12,069 --> 03:36:24,629
No, I, no, that's not, I, I, this is all a mistake.

3459
03:36:25,530 --> 03:36:32,969
No, Mason Mole, time for us to come clean.

3460
03:36:32,969 --> 03:36:40,020
Frog Detective, ever since you moved in next door to my office, I felt threatened.

3461
03:36:40,020 --> 03:36:42,520
So methodical in your case solving.

3462
03:36:42,520 --> 03:36:45,799
I would read your blogs and go green with envy.

3463
03:36:45,799 --> 03:36:50,969
I've been number one best detective for so long that I grew complacent.

3464
03:36:52,340 --> 03:36:54,659
Every time the supervisor had a mystery to solve,

3465
03:36:54,659 --> 03:36:58,700
I began to believe I wouldn't be able to do it.

3466
03:36:58,700 --> 03:36:59,899
Passed it on to you.

3467
03:36:59,899 --> 03:37:06,700
I just began to pretend to solve mysteries, hoping the supervisor wouldn't notice.

3468
03:37:06,700 --> 03:37:11,940
I was embarrassed at myself and angry at you.

3469
03:37:11,940 --> 03:37:15,940
Angry, but Lobster Cop, your investigative abilities far outweigh mine.

3470
03:37:15,940 --> 03:37:23,270
Maybe they used to, but I became so focused on my own shortcomings that my work suffered.

3471
03:37:23,270 --> 03:37:25,030
Mason Mole is there for me.

3472
03:37:25,030 --> 03:37:28,950
Having friends is so important, but we're a bad influence on each other.

3473
03:37:30,360 --> 03:37:34,760
I needed work, and so I suggested to Lobster Cop that I help take you down,

3474
03:37:34,760 --> 03:37:35,879
and I had the perfect plan.

3475
03:37:35,879 --> 03:37:37,879
I'm very subtle, you see.

3476
03:37:37,879 --> 03:37:42,540
I'm ashamed that it got to that point.

3477
03:37:42,540 --> 03:37:48,969
Instead of asking you for help or swallowing my pride, I let my jealousy get the best of me.

3478
03:37:48,969 --> 03:37:51,879
How did you frame the detective?

3479
03:37:51,879 --> 03:37:53,319
It was a joint effort.

3480
03:37:53,319 --> 03:37:57,639
When I arrived in town, I sneakily stole all the hats and quickly buried them in the graveyard.

3481
03:37:57,639 --> 03:38:01,750
I wrote a map to where they were buried for the detective to find.

3482
03:38:01,750 --> 03:38:04,299
But I didn't find the map.

3483
03:38:04,299 --> 03:38:06,040
Susie did.

3484
03:38:06,040 --> 03:38:07,719
I didn't execute it very well, I admit.

3485
03:38:08,120 --> 03:38:12,889
Once you had the resources to dig up the hats and Lobster Cop had a clear alibi,

3486
03:38:12,889 --> 03:38:14,729
I waited in place to take your photo.

3487
03:38:15,940 --> 03:38:18,500
Wait, what was Lobster Cop's alibi?

3488
03:38:18,500 --> 03:38:22,120
He was eating a delicious meal.

3489
03:38:22,120 --> 03:38:22,840
Of course.

3490
03:38:22,840 --> 03:38:29,079
I'm ashamed to say that I also drew evil eyebrows on the photo of you.

3491
03:38:29,079 --> 03:38:34,389
But what I don't understand is why you put me in a bad room.

3492
03:38:34,389 --> 03:38:37,270
Framing me was bad, but you made a whole room for me to be trapped.

3493
03:38:37,270 --> 03:38:38,389
That's so cruel.

3494
03:38:38,389 --> 03:38:41,020
I'm inclined to agree.

3495
03:38:41,020 --> 03:38:43,989
Putting somebody into a room, whether they did a naughty thing or not,

3496
03:38:43,989 --> 03:38:45,430
seems really harsh and unfair.

3497
03:38:45,430 --> 03:38:49,770
How is someone supposed to grow from their mistakes if they're just sitting around trapped?

3498
03:38:49,770 --> 03:38:51,559
I really don't like that room.

3499
03:38:51,559 --> 03:38:53,770
I hate that room.

3500
03:38:53,770 --> 03:38:56,780
Bad room was my idea, I'm sorry.

3501
03:38:56,780 --> 03:38:58,540
It's a terrible idea.

3502
03:38:58,540 --> 03:39:00,969
I realize it's now my bad.

3503
03:39:00,969 --> 03:39:09,059
Lobster Cop, Mason Mole, you've done something very serious and mean, similar to a crime.

3504
03:39:09,059 --> 03:39:13,819
Our society doesn't have strategies in place to deal with things like this.

3505
03:39:13,819 --> 03:39:15,819
Are you going to send us to the bad room?

3506
03:39:15,819 --> 03:39:18,219
I absolutely not.

3507
03:39:18,219 --> 03:39:19,510
It's messed up.

3508
03:39:19,510 --> 03:39:23,379
But I think there needs to be consequences.

3509
03:39:23,379 --> 03:39:27,909
Lobster Cop, you've abused your power in ways that I cannot begin to comprehend.

3510
03:39:27,909 --> 03:39:32,360
Mason Mole, you enabled and encouraged this behavior.

3511
03:39:32,360 --> 03:39:33,639
I'm mad at you both.

3512
03:39:33,639 --> 03:39:35,959
Deserve that.

3513
03:39:35,959 --> 03:39:40,379
I think an appropriate course of action is to remove Lobster Cop from the detective agency.

3514
03:39:40,379 --> 03:39:44,489
I think you should change career paths for your own good.

3515
03:39:44,489 --> 03:39:45,049
Boil him.

3516
03:39:49,129 --> 03:39:52,010
And boil him is what you're saying over here.

3517
03:39:52,010 --> 03:39:54,780
Maybe do something that helps contribute to society.

3518
03:39:54,780 --> 03:39:57,030
Hop no longer.

3519
03:39:57,030 --> 03:40:04,549
I'll hand in my badge and my gun.

3520
03:40:04,549 --> 03:40:05,270
Gun?

3521
03:40:05,270 --> 03:40:07,290
Wait, why do you have a gun?

3522
03:40:07,290 --> 03:40:09,579
I didn't even know they were real.

3523
03:40:09,579 --> 03:40:11,530
That's really messed up.

3524
03:40:11,530 --> 03:40:15,590
Not like I ever used it.

3525
03:40:15,590 --> 03:40:19,850
Mate, I gave Lobster Cop the gun.

3526
03:40:19,850 --> 03:40:22,489
OK, well, yes, please hand that in.

3527
03:40:22,489 --> 03:40:28,659
Have an idea of what you could do as job, Lobster Cop.

3528
03:40:28,659 --> 03:40:29,219
Oh?

3529
03:40:29,219 --> 03:40:32,600
Why don't you talk to Barney about joining the Post Office?

3530
03:40:32,600 --> 03:40:37,079
Lobster, Posty has a nice ring to it.

3531
03:40:37,079 --> 03:40:40,020
Can I join too?

3532
03:40:40,020 --> 03:40:41,459
I don't see why not.

3533
03:40:41,459 --> 03:40:44,020
Well, then it's settled.

3534
03:40:44,020 --> 03:40:50,739
Lobster, Posty, Posty Mason Mole, do you have anything to say to the detective?

3535
03:40:50,739 --> 03:40:51,299
Yes.

3536
03:40:51,299 --> 03:40:54,649
I'm sincerely sorry for what I did to you, detective.

3537
03:40:54,649 --> 03:40:58,010
You isn't mean, rude, evil, and not nice.

3538
03:40:58,010 --> 03:41:05,159
I don't expect you to forgive me, but time I can prove myself as a great posty.

3539
03:41:05,159 --> 03:41:05,399
Right?

3540
03:41:05,399 --> 03:41:06,520
Some of the wrongs I've done.

3541
03:41:06,520 --> 03:41:14,059
Detective, I acted poorly and encouraged behavior that I shouldn't have.

3542
03:41:14,059 --> 03:41:17,479
I'm going to channel that energy from being a posty,

3543
03:41:17,479 --> 03:41:20,760
and please rest assured you'll never have a late parcel again.

3544
03:41:22,469 --> 03:41:23,909
Thank you both for the apology.

3545
03:41:23,909 --> 03:41:32,120
I accept it.

3546
03:41:32,120 --> 03:41:33,639
Hey, now that's all sorted.

3547
03:41:33,639 --> 03:41:37,379
I have an announcement to make.

3548
03:41:37,379 --> 03:41:40,950
Lobster Cop is no longer the number one best detective.

3549
03:41:40,950 --> 03:41:43,110
After some impeccable detective work on this case,

3550
03:41:43,110 --> 03:41:46,549
I'm really pleased to announce the new number one best detective is,

3551
03:41:46,549 --> 03:41:52,819
congratulations to Mr. Remonkey.

3552
03:41:52,819 --> 03:41:57,930
Wow, congratulations, Mr. Remonkey.

3553
03:41:57,930 --> 03:41:58,649
What an achievement.

3554
03:41:59,989 --> 03:42:01,510
I can't believe it.

3555
03:42:01,510 --> 03:42:02,629
Thank you so much.

3556
03:42:03,510 --> 03:42:07,829
I'll have to shut down my research facility so I can investigate full time.

3557
03:42:07,829 --> 03:42:10,700
You can move into my old office.

3558
03:42:10,700 --> 03:42:12,860
There's already a bunch of trophies in there for you to keep.

3559
03:42:14,020 --> 03:42:14,520
Great.

3560
03:42:15,219 --> 03:42:18,389
What an honor to work next door to the number one best detective.

3561
03:42:18,389 --> 03:42:22,149
Again, this calls for a celebration.

3562
03:42:22,229 --> 03:42:24,309
Barney, can you prep the saloon for a dance party?

3563
03:42:26,260 --> 03:42:27,450
Can do.

3564
03:42:27,450 --> 03:42:29,370
Oh, and lobster posty, posty mason mo?

3565
03:42:30,299 --> 03:42:31,299
Yeah.

3566
03:42:31,299 --> 03:42:35,579
You're invited too.

3567
03:42:35,579 --> 03:42:36,540
Let's party.

3568
03:42:36,540 --> 03:42:43,219
It's time for a dance party.

3569
03:42:43,219 --> 03:42:43,719
Yay.

3570
03:42:44,180 --> 03:42:44,680
Yay.

3571
03:42:45,219 --> 03:42:45,860
Oh, look.

3572
03:42:45,860 --> 03:42:46,360
Yay.

3573
03:42:46,819 --> 03:42:52,620
Holy shit, the lobster is going fucking hard.

3574
03:42:57,190 --> 03:42:57,690
Geez.

3575
03:42:58,309 --> 03:42:58,809
Jesus.

3576
03:42:59,829 --> 03:43:08,500
That was cute.

3577
03:43:24,549 --> 03:43:34,040
Hit the yoinky splinky.

3578
03:43:34,040 --> 03:43:35,319
Well, we have to wait till after the credits.

3579
03:43:35,319 --> 03:43:35,799
We can't.

3580
03:43:35,799 --> 03:43:36,440
I'm not going anywhere.

3581
03:44:01,850 --> 03:44:03,530
Why do I feel like these are mo-capped?

3582
03:44:05,750 --> 03:44:07,430
Don't they look mo-capped?

3583
03:44:13,930 --> 03:44:14,489
They are.

3584
03:44:14,489 --> 03:44:15,209
Okay.

3585
03:44:15,209 --> 03:44:23,979
Two weeks later.

3586
03:44:23,979 --> 03:44:34,100
Am I frog detective or am I mystery monkey?

3587
03:44:34,100 --> 03:44:37,079
Oh, look.

3588
03:44:37,079 --> 03:44:37,799
That's cute.

3589
03:44:37,799 --> 03:44:49,620
Frog detective, crime solving agency frog detective speaking.

3590
03:44:49,620 --> 03:44:52,229
How may I solve your mystery?

3591
03:44:52,229 --> 03:44:54,219
Hey, frog detective.

3592
03:44:54,219 --> 03:44:55,500
Yes, mystery monkey.

3593
03:44:55,500 --> 03:44:56,809
Happy birthday.

3594
03:44:57,860 --> 03:44:58,659
Thank you so much.

3595
03:44:59,219 --> 03:45:03,559
I know it's your birthday but I have a really difficult case.

3596
03:45:03,559 --> 03:45:05,819
I just can't crack.

3597
03:45:05,819 --> 03:45:08,860
But you're number one best detective.

3598
03:45:08,860 --> 03:45:11,399
I know but this one's a doozy.

3599
03:45:11,399 --> 03:45:13,780
Could you help me out?

3600
03:45:13,780 --> 03:45:14,180
Of course.

3601
03:45:14,180 --> 03:45:15,059
I'll be right there.

3602
03:45:15,059 --> 03:45:27,020
Why don't you call the phone?

3603
03:45:27,020 --> 03:45:33,579
Hey, detective.

3604
03:45:33,579 --> 03:45:34,459
Well, well, well.

3605
03:45:34,459 --> 03:45:36,700
Is it mystery monkey 49?

3606
03:45:36,700 --> 03:45:40,780
Good to see you, frog detective 03.

3607
03:45:40,780 --> 03:45:41,420
What?

3608
03:45:41,420 --> 03:45:43,459
Just a joke.

3609
03:45:43,459 --> 03:45:46,549
Are there two other frog detectives?

3610
03:45:46,549 --> 03:45:47,909
I don't know.

3611
03:45:47,909 --> 03:45:48,950
I was just joking.

3612
03:45:48,950 --> 03:45:51,270
You got me worried.

3613
03:45:51,270 --> 03:45:53,590
That really stresses me out.

3614
03:45:53,590 --> 03:45:57,829
Frog detective 1, frog detective 2, and now frog detective 3.

3615
03:45:57,829 --> 03:46:01,670
How do you think I feel with 48 other mystery monkeys?

3616
03:46:01,670 --> 03:46:03,290
Hmm.

3617
03:46:03,290 --> 03:46:04,010
Good point.

3618
03:46:04,010 --> 03:46:06,760
Anyway, thanks for meeting me here.

3619
03:46:06,760 --> 03:46:08,760
Case information is in the other room.

3620
03:46:08,760 --> 03:46:10,840
Just head down the hallway and I'll meet you there.

3621
03:46:10,840 --> 03:46:12,469
Will do.

3622
03:46:12,469 --> 03:46:30,020
Oh, it's all pasted over at this point.

3623
03:46:30,020 --> 03:47:00,020
Wait a minute.

3624
03:47:00,020 --> 03:47:04,299
It's a surprise birthday party.

3625
03:47:04,299 --> 03:47:05,579
Oh my god.

3626
03:47:06,139 --> 03:47:09,399
What's everybody doing here?

3627
03:47:09,399 --> 03:47:13,000
Well, detective, we appreciate everything you've done for us.

3628
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:17,049
Yeah, our town has never been so peaceful all thanks to you.

3629
03:47:17,049 --> 03:47:21,379
Anyway, with my island, I haven't heard a ghost in ages.

3630
03:47:21,379 --> 03:47:24,809
I mean, technically, you never heard a ghost.

3631
03:47:24,809 --> 03:47:30,010
We heard it's your birthday so we all arranged to come here and surprise you.

3632
03:47:30,010 --> 03:47:30,969
It worked.

3633
03:47:30,969 --> 03:47:32,469
That's not all, detective.

3634
03:47:32,469 --> 03:47:33,670
We got you a present.

3635
03:47:33,670 --> 03:47:36,840
It should be coming any minute now.

3636
03:47:36,840 --> 03:47:40,680
I ordered it on whiz bay.

3637
03:47:40,680 --> 03:47:42,659
Oh, there it is.

3638
03:47:46,040 --> 03:47:48,200
Special birthday delivery.

3639
03:47:48,200 --> 03:47:53,000
Is that for me?

3640
03:47:53,719 --> 03:47:54,360
Open it up.

3641
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:59,030
Oh, it's a hat that fits his head.

3642
03:48:00,840 --> 03:48:01,559
Happy birthday.

3643
03:48:02,120 --> 03:48:02,840
Wait, what is it?

3644
03:48:03,559 --> 03:48:04,360
That's easy, detective.

3645
03:48:04,360 --> 03:48:05,319
It's a hat.

3646
03:48:05,319 --> 03:48:06,040
I can't wear hats.

3647
03:48:06,040 --> 03:48:08,520
My head shape is I have a different head shape.

3648
03:48:08,520 --> 03:48:10,569
How don't you just try it on?

3649
03:48:10,569 --> 03:48:13,319
Oh, boy.

3650
03:48:13,319 --> 03:48:15,290
What the heck?

3651
03:48:15,290 --> 03:48:18,329
Oh, would you look at that?

3652
03:48:19,059 --> 03:48:32,340
It's a hat that fits like Arnold's hat from Hey Arnold.

3653
03:48:32,340 --> 03:48:33,700
Yeah, that's true.

3654
03:48:35,079 --> 03:48:36,280
Thank you for playing Frog Detective.

3655
03:48:36,280 --> 03:48:39,079
We have loved making these games for you and we are so grateful

3656
03:48:39,079 --> 03:48:42,280
that so many people have spent time with our silly story.

3657
03:48:44,090 --> 03:48:44,969
That was very cute.

3658
03:48:44,969 --> 03:48:45,530
It's very nice.

3659
03:48:46,250 --> 03:48:48,860
I'm glad I played it.

3660
03:48:49,500 --> 03:48:57,510
So is that the whole that's it then?

3661
03:48:58,229 --> 03:48:59,350
Three episodes, right?

3662
03:49:00,069 --> 03:49:07,670
Aren't these literally like $2 or something?

3663
03:49:08,309 --> 03:49:09,780
These are like less.

3664
03:49:09,780 --> 03:49:11,780
I think this game is less than $5 for each episode, right?

3665
03:49:15,860 --> 03:49:18,889
Five bucks trilogy.

3666
03:49:18,889 --> 03:49:23,370
Yeah, very cute.

3667
03:49:25,000 --> 03:49:25,479
Oh, okay.

3668
03:49:25,479 --> 03:49:25,879
Hold on.

3669
03:49:26,520 --> 03:49:34,729
The game actually ended on March 1st, so you have to eat a whole cake on stream.

3670
03:49:36,309 --> 03:49:40,469
No, it's 10 o'clock Pacific.

3671
03:49:40,469 --> 03:49:41,430
That's not accurate.

3672
03:49:54,629 --> 03:49:58,739
Yeah, so that's that's Frog Detective.

3673
03:49:58,739 --> 03:49:59,299
Really nice.

3674
03:50:00,020 --> 03:50:00,899
Close the book on that.

3675
03:50:03,930 --> 03:50:10,379
I want to play Hylix, but I think I think we're going to wait.

3676
03:50:11,020 --> 03:50:12,540
I don't think I want to start that right now.

3677
03:50:12,540 --> 03:50:14,059
I feel like I would only play for like an hour.

3678
03:50:14,059 --> 03:50:22,200
So here's the plan.

3679
03:50:24,229 --> 03:50:28,899
Uh, I want to make sure that all the Grotto Beast stuff is going smoothly.

3680
03:50:31,620 --> 03:50:37,799
So as of tomorrow, I don't know if I'm going to there will definitely be a stream on Thursday

3681
03:50:37,799 --> 03:50:42,629
on the second, but I just want to make sure everything's going well.

3682
03:50:42,629 --> 03:50:54,409
Keep an eye on the sus, but I'm imagining the next time I'll be live will be Thursday or Friday.

3683
03:50:54,409 --> 03:50:58,870
Also GrottoBeasts.net GrottoBeasts.net

3684
03:50:58,870 --> 03:51:04,180
We went over it in detail a couple hours ago, but that project is now available.

3685
03:51:04,180 --> 03:51:05,059
It's in presale.

3686
03:51:05,059 --> 03:51:06,420
It'll be in presale for a while.

3687
03:51:06,420 --> 03:51:19,079
If you feel like buying it, if you want to participate, it is available right now.

3688
03:51:19,079 --> 03:51:20,120
Pog, indeed.

3689
03:51:20,760 --> 03:51:33,129
Yeah, hope you had fun.

3690
03:51:33,129 --> 03:51:42,379
So you see why I waited so long to do this because oh my goodness, am I full of air?

3691
03:51:42,379 --> 03:51:44,979
Why am I full of helium today?

3692
03:51:44,979 --> 03:51:58,760
That's like the 15th time that's happened.

3693
03:51:58,760 --> 03:51:59,399
The end.

3694
03:51:59,399 --> 03:52:02,889
Yeah, over the next few days, because I don't want to,

3695
03:52:02,889 --> 03:52:05,590
I didn't want to overwhelm everybody with a bunch of stuff.

3696
03:52:05,590 --> 03:52:12,940
I'm going to show some of the merch and I'm going to show the box because I have access to it.

3697
03:52:12,940 --> 03:52:14,219
So you will see the product.

3698
03:52:14,219 --> 03:52:15,100
I'll have it in my hands.

3699
03:52:15,100 --> 03:52:16,379
We'll kind of go over it a little bit.

3700
03:52:16,379 --> 03:52:21,479
But I want it tonight to be sort of the announcement and the presale launch.

3701
03:52:21,479 --> 03:52:23,479
And maybe in a couple days we'll go over some more stuff,

3702
03:52:23,479 --> 03:52:26,280
but I don't want to overwhelm you or myself.

3703
03:52:26,280 --> 03:52:30,950
The pin tweet should now be GrottoBeasts.

3704
03:52:30,950 --> 03:52:33,190
That is absolutely what's going to happen.

3705
03:52:33,190 --> 03:52:36,329
GrottoBeasts.net

3706
03:52:36,329 --> 03:52:37,690
We got a starter kit.

3707
03:52:37,690 --> 03:52:41,059
We got card packs.

3708
03:52:41,059 --> 03:52:42,819
Hope you like it.

3709
03:52:42,819 --> 03:52:45,620
We'll be talking way more about this in the next couple of weeks.

3710
03:52:45,620 --> 03:52:49,850
I can assure you.

3711
03:52:49,850 --> 03:52:52,250
And I will see you guys in maybe a couple days.

3712
03:52:52,250 --> 03:53:08,010
Keep an eye on the sus.

3713
03:53:08,010 --> 03:53:09,770
Take care of yourselves.

3714
03:53:09,770 --> 03:53:13,899
Have a good one.

3715
03:53:13,899 --> 03:53:18,700
Yeah, Breath of the Wild will show up again soon.

3716
03:53:18,700 --> 03:53:24,100
Once we run out of stuff to do, some of these games that I've been trying to finish.

3717
03:53:26,200 --> 03:53:27,319
Yeah, we'll play it again.

3718
03:53:27,319 --> 03:53:28,040
I will.

3719
03:53:28,040 --> 03:53:30,360
I'm going to finish it absolutely before the new one comes out.

3720
03:53:30,360 --> 03:53:31,700
That's for sure.

3721
03:53:31,700 --> 03:53:35,770
And then I'll wait like a year to play the new one or something, right?

3722
03:53:43,030 --> 03:53:43,989
We'll see you in a couple days.

3723
03:53:45,530 --> 03:53:46,010
Good night.

3724
03:53:46,729 --> 03:53:47,209
Goodbye.

3725
03:53:48,469 --> 03:53:49,430
Call your mother.

3726
03:53:49,430 --> 03:53:50,649
Take care of yourselves.

3727
03:53:53,459 --> 03:53:55,219
Good job on GrottoBeasts and the team.

3728
03:53:55,940 --> 03:53:58,420
We really appreciate it.

3729
03:53:58,420 --> 03:53:59,379
When you get it in your hands,

3730
03:54:00,340 --> 03:54:04,340
I hope that you open it and say this was worth it.

3731
03:54:04,340 --> 03:54:05,270
I hope so.

3732
03:54:12,760 --> 03:54:14,200
Have a fantastic night.

3733
03:54:14,840 --> 03:54:18,629
See you guys soon.

3734
03:54:18,629 --> 03:56:09,909
Take care.
