22
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,650
first of first of all

23
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,650
Let's talk about this

24
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,430

00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,090
Which I have not updated

28
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,780
Oh, yeah

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,310
I

30
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,629
It is the way it is the way that it's gonna be for now

31
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:30,139
Yeah, i've heard this game is very weird

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,419
I've been told it's gonna be right up my alley. It's not that long, but we'll see

33
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,740
I've heard that before

34
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,610
I've heard it's very good

35
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,810
There's also a sequel. So if I like this

36
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:44,729
then

37
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,340
I have probably played the sequel at some point

38
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,129
We have grotto beast stuff to go over a little bit later as well

39
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,199
kind of a

40
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,199
secondary clarification

41
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:01,259
An amendment to the faq we saw a couple days ago

42
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,620

44
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,780

That's the plan for today

50
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:48,330
No, this is by the this is not an unboxing. This is not an unboxing. This is essentially

51
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,370
These are printing samples

52
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:53,430
Is what these are

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,430
Because everything is still in production right now

54
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:58,789
So these are printing samples just want to show you what you're planning on getting

All right, but anyways very excited. It's been going incredibly well

60
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,620
Everybody on the grotto beast team is is completely blown away. It's been more than we ever thought

61
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:36,300
so

62
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,899
People go over it all

63
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:41,660
But I want to obviously not do it immediately i'm gonna do the same thing like we did a few days ago

64
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,579
I'm gonna play hylix for a little bit

65
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,350

00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,430
Let's see what we got here

73
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:20,410

78
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,350

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:58,069
Um, I don't I have no idea. All I know is that it's a it's a game. Let's go

85
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,439

00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:28,920
Miraculously purifies the chemicals people hark out of a field. It is a chemical below a product. It is a memory

Pleather what did I learn? This is a horror game. I don't think it's a horror game

163
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:41,920
That was one of my favorites. Yeah

164
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,420
The trash man

165
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,289
Okay, let's go. Wait, I didn't go in here. You're the bug guy, right?

166
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:56,930
She's more beast than prison now. Did I go in here? Yes. All right, so let me leave

167
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:07,720
I got what I wanted. Let's explore the rest of this place the bird sound

168
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,400
You know the bird sound I actually am sad that I did because a sub sound is like, okay

169
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
everybody pause for a second the

170
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,910
We're gonna the funny line is gonna be said the bird sound

171
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:26,900
Ruined old streams because it was just noise that just would happen randomly instead of it being like

172
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,660
I'm in the middle of saying something or talking. It's oh, hey guys. And by the way, here's what we're what

173
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:37,700
The trash man everybody stops and we just listen to it for a second

174
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:42,579
But eventually it got to a point where it was so in the background

175
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,000
That you would just randomly talking over me would be like

176
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:57,730
I've gone back and watched old vods and gone. Oh, but turn that off. Okay, so I looked at that

177
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,089
Let's look at this

178
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:19,589
Can I go that way? Whoa, can I not leave yet? Can we just listen to this for a second? You watch yourself?

179
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,079
No, but sometimes I'll go back and just check on old vods and stuff

180
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,599
You know, you never know. I just want to know I want to see if what kind of

181
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,430
Something interesting too is I've been doing this for like 12 13 years now

182
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:38,309
That's kind of interesting sometimes just to go back and be like what was I like like five years ago two years ago

183
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,390
Eight years ago interesting sometimes

184
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:49,670
So looking at old photos. I mean, I don't do this that often

185
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,779
This is maybe like once every maybe like once every year or two

186
00:21:53,859 --> 00:22:06,559
I'll go back and look at some stuff interesting and we've done this on stream before. What do you mean?

187
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:28,960
Mysterious tower do not touch the ambulant skulls or you will die to initiate warp make contact with the central node

188
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:41,359
Unauthorized access is discouraged. Thank you for understanding. Am I gonna fight mirror delusions may rock this sort of chemical

189
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:50,130
Warp access is currently infested creature spirit the dotted red line

190
00:22:50,369 --> 00:23:00,200
It will not cross it. Enjoy your time in the warp access like a safe zone. What does it go? Are these enemies?

191
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,759
These are enemies

192
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:31,269
Okay. Whoa. Oh my god. I'm gonna die. How do I run? How do I run? I'm gonna die

193
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,990
I think i'm gonna die right now. When's the last time I saved the game? How do I run?

194
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,880
I haven't saved the game in like 20 30 minutes. How do I run? You can't am I in trouble?

195
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:55,460
Wait, I could eat a bunch of vegetables. Is that am I all right?

196
00:23:55,779 --> 00:24:11,359
Should I just you can't run should I just eat vegetables and just make it happen? Wayne was slain

197
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:30,319
What what the hell just happened? So this is the afterlife feel free to crash on the couch

198
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:38,640
You can use the machine over there to convert any meat you found into flesh points

199
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:47,410
I have a meat deposited one meat into the grinder your maximum flesh point rose, too

200
00:24:47,650 --> 00:25:01,859
That's cool. And these are fast travel points. I get it. But where am I?

201
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:24,359

207
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:10,799
I think I can hear a tv set behind this wall if I had dynamite I could put

208
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:36,680
This is where you learn abilities learned calibration. I love this game. Hilux 2 is also really good

213
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:35,029
It's just it's just I have such attention problems in the first place

214
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:39,829
That it became really clear that I was just fucking myself up so bad

215
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:46,390
Even when not even just like taking a little sometimes so it's just like no no, not anymore

All right. So this so this is like the town with the shops. This is my house

223
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:20,099
This is a some kind of monument or tower or something. This was where I got killed

224
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:34,769
So where do I go from here? Go back to that other place and just try not to die or try to avoid don't fight anything

243
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,099
To a little thing I did on the dollhouse stream. I mean that wasn't a dance

244
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:35,219
That was just you guys called it that so I mean, is that really a dance? I said it

00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:49,090
Did I make that up? No, I didn't. All right. So I think I think I saw everything I need to see here

246
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:57,480
Let me see. What about the pick? Can I take the paper cup anywhere here? I feel like I might be able to

249
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:19,059
Everybody's hitting the yoinkies flunky. Oh, this is mount mournful

Does this have controller support? Can I plug my controller in and move or no? No, okay doubt it

252
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:59,269

00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:51,639
Why they wait, they all got it. Wait, why did they all get it? They all got it. What just happened

309
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:55,880
They all just got it

310
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:02,980
Why did this do it to everybody?

311
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,300
They get it from okay. They got it from the statue. I was gonna say what?

312
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,360
Come on, man

313
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,360
Thankfully, two of them are still asleep

314
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:26,559
Juice box, right? Yeah

315
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,750
Cool. All right, they're asleep

316
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:36,789
Now I now that I have mightiness up

317
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,840
Let's do this

318
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,670
That's gonna be huge

319
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,670
54 damage right now get out of here

320
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,289
Oh that one was asleep. I'm an idiot. It's all right. I'll get it. I figured it out

321
00:48:51,010 --> 00:49:01,960
I don't think I need to eat anything or I think i'm good

322
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,760
Backgrounds are really trippy. They're really crazy

323
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:16,440
All right

324
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,440
I think I want to go buy stuff

325
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:21,059
Is there anywhere I can go from here? Is it just that's it?

326
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:46,769
I think that's it. I did the paper cup here. I already got it. Yeah, I have a lot of money

327
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:56,119
I'm gonna go buy stuff. I want to watch this but the visuals are giving me a headache

328
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:00,739
Should there be something in the title? It just says like the you know, hey like

329
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:06,230
Visuals are like kind of trippy or something. Probably not a bad idea

330
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:15,539
I guess it's not too too bad, right? Not enough for like a warning

331
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,760
I don't know. What do you guys think?

332
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:33,409
Maybe like an eye strain warning

333
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:37,380
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine

334
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,449
It doesn't seem dangerous. No, I don't think so

335
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:46,900
eye strain

336
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,900
warning eye strain incoming

337
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,940
I said this actually is fine for me. I'm very sensitive to stuff like this and I've

338
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:10,480
Um, i've been okay

339
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,079
oops

340
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,440
I didn't mean to do what did I just do skip?

341
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:19,329
warning don't watch

342
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:25,650
Stop missing

343
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,079
Oh my god, we're gonna die

344
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,719
finally

345
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:35,559
Oh my god

346
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,559
Are we this oh wicked with blind?

347
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,000
Okay, well

348
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:52,070
You know something that removes this status effects, right?

349
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:08,280
Veggies do

350
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,280
I have a lot of money

351
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:50,900
We gotta go. I have like a couple at least two or three thousand bucks. Don't I? All right. What do you sell? Okay

352
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,659
turbo tendons

353
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:56,659
allows where to wield two weapons

354
00:52:57,989 --> 00:53:04,519
20% of where's normal attacks inflict poison. Okay, so should should somebody have poison or is this too expensive for right now?

355
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:22,960
Get cellophane how many like two three? I don't want to spend that much. All right, i'll get two

356
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,900
This is i'm gonna get this so I want someone to have that

357
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:50,150
So this is this prevents blind and this is poison poison damage and then they no prevents blind set

358
00:53:50,150 --> 00:54:18,760
That's actually huge right now anything else for me to purchase. There's another strap too in there. Yeah, what do you got l?

359
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:36,880
Giant metal dome apparel too large to be worn with any other armor. What does it do plus 50 plus 50 what armor?

360
00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:44,360
I mean, that's pretty good

361
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:53,429
So but I can't wear this with anything else so I wouldn't be able to have this and the sunglasses on i'll get it

362
00:54:53,670 --> 00:55:26,179
Okay, is that worth it? What is it? What stats is it increasing 30 30 everything looks the same

363
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:47,590
It's just an armor rating. Well, might as well give that to you. It's flesh slash health. Oh, okay

364
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:59,269
Oh that may okay. Look at 140 health. Holy smokes. That's a lot. My tortoise is watching this stream

365
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:12,900
She hates you but I think she likes the game. Okay, I think that's good

366
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:26,179
Can I where do I buy vegetables like i'm running out? Is there another there's another store here, right?

367
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:38,869
Or can you only get them from the garden? They grow infinitely. Oh that I was gonna say that makes sense

368
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:54,599
Um, um, um, somebody said that song was scratching their frontal lobe. I feel like I may have missed a secret or two here

369
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:12,320
Maybe I have trashcan

370
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:41,090
I already got it. Didn't I or is there another trash can? Oh there is 47 bucks in here. Check the tv again

371
00:57:44,099 --> 00:58:10,039
Okay, something else. Um, all right now i'm pretty decked out now. I'm going to do that other stuff

372
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:16,469
I'm going to where I got in trouble last time. That's a good idea and we're probably

373
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:22,440
I think i'm gonna show some grotto bee stuff talk about it for a little bit. I think I was gonna wait like an hour

374
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:33,250
We've got to go over some questions and some answers. I want to show the box. I have it here

375
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:40,739
We can go over some stuff like give me one second. I'm gonna this can just stay right here

376
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:48,389
Yeah, we'll come right back to this. I just want to show

377
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:55,909
Actually, let me get that here. All right, I want to go over

378
00:58:57,809 --> 00:59:04,079
Since grotto beasts has gone into presale. I really want to go over some of the more

379
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:11,480
Some amendments to that faq and this this whole thing is going to get pieced together in any of this faq stuff that you guys

380
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,480
Have seen so far will be on the website

381
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:15,159
We just want to clean it up and make sure it's correct

382
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:18,400
but there's a lot of stuff to go over because

383
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,119
We have uh, we have hit a very very interesting milestone and uh, we'll talk about it

384
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:28,699
So let's start we're gonna start at the top. Here comes another presentation

385
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:40,800
Presentation incoming it is only one slide this time. So don't worry. It's not like 10 slides. Let's

386
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:49,300
Do that right now. Let me get it up. It's only one slide

387
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,849
Yeah

388
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:54,849
There were just some other things we wanted to make sure people were aware of and i'm just going to read this stuff pretty much

389
00:59:54,849 --> 01:00:02,309
Line by line powerpoint. Okay, let me get it up here

390
01:00:06,579 --> 01:00:09,619
Okay

391
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:11,960
Okay

392
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:17,119
Okay, let's go over this because these are this is going to answer some questions

393
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:27,480
And go over some important, um store updates dates and limited items. Okay, so there's a lot of text on this screen

394
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:31,219
So just be aware. I want to get it on one slide. Here we go

395
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:39,760
Here are some clarifications and amendments to what we talked about two three days ago. So

396
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:48,230
Grotto beasts is in presale right now. It's available right now on grottobeasts.net. This is very yeah, there's a lot of text

397
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:49,909
I'm gonna read it

398
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:56,469
So we've had a lot of questions since this and don't skip ahead. Don't skip. I know you're gonna read ahead

399
01:00:56,550 --> 01:01:04,119
Don't skip ahead wait for me to read. Oh shit cartoon mischief

400
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:08,130
All right, so we've had a lot of questions about the holographics

401
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,719
Wait, you've got four different holographic types. Does that mean that each card could have a holographic and four different versions?

402
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:23,460
No, there are four types of holographic film and each card has a specific holographic film type assigned to it

403
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:33,940
So for example, you will you should never find a fretsal right here that has anything but a hollow dot pattern

404
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,570
So I think a lot of people were saying whoa

405
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:43,489
That seems like a lot of potential holographics for if it's each one has the no, no, no, they're all assigned

406
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:49,219
So that we've had that question come in a lot

407
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:57,300
So we've also we've numbered our production so that every booster pack will have one rare card and exactly one holographic card in every booster pack

408
01:01:57,619 --> 01:02:04,199
So what that means the hollow is one random card which can be either rare or common so some packs

409
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,320
Will potentially have two rares. We've got that question a lot too

410
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:13,170
Now for some store updates

411
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,039
Let's go over some updates on the store

412
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:24,449
Uh, do not read the second line yet. I know you already have but it's fucking crazy

413
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,440
We are going to let everyone know when we have an exact date in mind for the presale to end

414
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,280
The store may halt for a while in that period and depending on inventory

415
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,599
We'll need to see what items will be available for when we leave presale up

416
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,989
This will be at least 10 to 14 days from now

417
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:50,800
So we don't have a hard date for the end of the presale, but it will be at least another two weeks

418
01:02:52,849 --> 01:02:54,849
So if you are buying it right now

419
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,760
We're trying to keep the presale up as long as we can

420
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:02,119
And the reason why we're doing that is because of the second line here

421
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,190
So the initial production of the boosters have all been claimed

422
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:15,000
So the boosters of of our first production run here have been claimed

423
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:17,409
So

424
01:03:17,409 --> 01:03:21,510
We're already in contact with the printer to scale up the production and order more

425
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:25,059
We want I want to touch again on this presale strategy. It's important

426
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:29,139
We didn't want our inventory currently in production to sell out

427
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:36,500
Ship out and have a secondary market takeover for people that didn't get in on the presale and wanted to claim items

428
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,969
This presale is going to continue normally

429
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:45,190
But those of you buying booster packs now, which is over our current inventory

430
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:49,090
You're going to need to wait a little longer for the till the next order

431
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:52,079
Uh, we'll get some better dates for you in the near future

432
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,840
But I we want to make sure we can make this really clear that there's going to be a waiting period

433
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:03,090
For boosters purchased as of this period now after the first shipments go out. This is very corporate

434
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:05,650
It has to be because I want to make sure I get this correct

435
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,110
so

436
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:12,550
That being said the availability the

437
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:16,070
This is not corporate anymore

438
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:22,400
The availability of the two player starter kits as I just heard holly laugh

439
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,679
As of this stream right now are not affected by the new production order

440
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:31,860
So people are still claiming through the stock and each kit has two boosters in it

441
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:36,050
So right now we've not gone through all of the starter kits

442
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:40,769
So those you're still fine if you if you're during the presale buying them now if you do

443
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:45,219
Uh, those as well as the first run of boosters are planning to ship out after the presale ends

444
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:51,090
So the starter kits are still available and it's not that boosters are not available

445
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,570
It's just the the second order

446
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:57,889
Of boosters is gonna you you'll get it later

447
01:04:57,969 --> 01:05:00,769
It's gonna be a I don't want to give you a date because we don't really know

448
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:08,469
But it shouldn't be that long, but it will be a little longer. So we want to make sure people know this

449
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:10,719
also

450
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:14,039
Important some of the we didn't make well

451
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:20,289
I want to make sure we mentioned this some of the apparel and prints are only available for a limited time until march 31st

452
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,179
So the the 40 the original 40 beast shirts the art prints

453
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:33,650
The grotto beast logo hat and beanies and the glow in the dark version of that ghost hoodie and tee

454
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:45,650
Are all leaving the store on the 31st. That's the plan now. I want to talk about this

455
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:48,769
Get off my screen get off my screen

456
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:54,719
So the age rating on the box, I want to make this really clear

457
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:00,070
So it's listed as six plus as more of a guideline for the physical product

458
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:05,280
There are dice in here. We wanted people to make sure that there are small pieces in here

459
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:11,119
Because if you bought this and that and there was no like, you know minimum sort of age rating on it

460
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,940
There are there are small physical pieces in here and we just want to make sure people know that

461
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,019
also

462
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:27,719
Very important. This is a mature audience channel and although there are no pieces of explicit language or imagery

463
01:06:28,929 --> 01:06:35,650
There are still references to tobacco cartoon violence cartoon mischief. It's it's stream references

464
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:38,949
So if you're like think about that, right?

465
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:44,960
There are references to characters here that might not be appropriate for little kids

466
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:49,800
But we try to make this project be as general audience as possible

467
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:56,050
But also keep in mind this is channel merch for this community first and foremost

468
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:00,019
This is merch for you guys

469
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:04,980
Merch for the community. That's all this project ever was intended to be so just be aware

470
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,539
That there are references to mature audience streams, even though we tried

471
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:19,090
To make this as general audience as we could you understand do you feel me outrage tobacco?

472
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:22,949
But you know, we want to make this clear for people

473
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:29,429
There are definitely going to be people that stumble upon this project and just potentially have no idea who the fuck I am

474
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:34,579
We just want people to know this

475
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:36,579
I do not understand

476
01:07:39,969 --> 01:07:41,480
so

477
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:50,440
With all this being said are we clear on this stuff? Are we clear on these? Is everybody clear?

478
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:55,909
Can you please put this into simpler terms?

479
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,280
Um, no, I can't

480
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,650
That'll get me in trouble

481
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:07,880
No, I cannot because I want to make sure we're very clear on what's happening

482
01:08:08,199 --> 01:08:13,559
I'll look over at the grotto bees group chat and it'll be in all capitals

483
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:23,520
Stop, stop, stop, stop. Can you explain this in family guy terms? No, I don't think I I don't think I can so

484
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,600
I it's time

485
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:32,159
I want to show you some things. He makes us sound so angry. No, they're i'm kidding

486
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,359
It's been it's a they're a wonderful group over there. I promise. I'm just kidding around

487
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:45,680
They are I have some things here that I would like to show you guys ready

488
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,550
Are you ready for me to reveal it? Stop bumping the mic. I'm not trying to

489
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:58,520
I'm gonna show you multiple things because it's kind of interesting how this plays out just sip my drink

490
01:09:00,449 --> 01:09:09,569
Okay, let's go like this. Let's go like this

491
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,600
And then let's go like this

492
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:25,810
Oh, they can see me. Hold on. Hold on

493
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:33,670
Hi, how are you? Where are you? Where the heck are you? No, you're up there. Good to see you again

494
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:40,239
Uh, we're gonna go over the box. You got a full beard. It's hey, it's been kind of a wild couple of weeks

495
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:46,800
I'm not I haven't shaved or anything. I've had a haircut. We're just i'm sorry. That's just the way it is

496
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:56,760
Is it really delayed? It shouldn't be. Oh, maybe the last time I used my face cam was let me see

497
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:06,979
No, that should be fine

498
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:09,699
Don't it shouldn't be that's not delayed. What are you talking about? That's fine. What do you mean?

499
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:18,550
All right. So let's all right. You ready? Sure, but you're ugly. I want to show you

500
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:24,020
Now don't look yet. I want to show you the first iteration of the box

501
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:30,579
I'm gonna get to see behind the curtain here. So this is what the box looked like

502
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:36,710
Originally, let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, so here it is

503
01:10:37,539 --> 01:10:42,479
So this is the original grotto beast box looks pretty cool, right?

504
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,270
This is the first iteration and I want to show you like it's it's all right

505
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:53,800
It's kind of it's kind of sturdy but not that sturdy and as you can see

506
01:10:56,289 --> 01:10:57,569
It's not

507
01:10:57,569 --> 01:11:01,960
We didn't we weren't really happy with this. We wanted there to be something interesting in here

508
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:10,850
This is where the dice were gonna go in here in this little thing, but it turned out to be kind of annoying

509
01:11:11,829 --> 01:11:15,279
Uh, it turned out to kind of it could get like kind of squished. So we decided

510
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:22,100
Maybe let's do another version right another iteration. It just it just doesn't it just it really just didn't do it for us

511
01:11:22,789 --> 01:11:24,789
And obviously if i'm gonna charge

512
01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:27,350
79 fucking dollars for something like that

513
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:32,069
I want to make at least fucking some you know, make it make a quality if I can right

514
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:36,359
Because I didn't we didn't want to sell this for 80 bucks. No fucking way. That was not gonna happen

515
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:47,840
So but we thought okay, what what can we do? Then we came to this one now this one

516
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:56,720
The you can even hear it the material is a lot sturdier. This is this is the box. This is the real box

517
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:02,979
So in here, I want to maybe I can show you the difference between like this

518
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:07,239
Here they are on top of each other like you might not be able to see the difference

519
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:13,640
But you can definitely feel it. This is a little I want to say flimsier. This one is it's hard. It's sturdier

520
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:20,979
So then yeah, take a look. There it is. Now you're probably saying do this stuff. Where's all where's all the stuff?

521
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,880
This is this is a print. This is a sample. So if you take a look down there, ooh

522
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:32,609
Cool. This is what sits in the middle, which is now holding the dice

523
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,369
And I kind of fucked it up a little bit. So this is my own fault

524
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,529
This is what it sits in now

525
01:12:38,529 --> 01:12:44,840
You get this little like boat and see there you see like the glowing it's like sits on top of this

526
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:48,439
This so it sits in the box like this

527
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:55,119
I fucked mine up because I was fucking with it too much but you get a dice boat that sits like this

528
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:58,760
And then there's two starter decks right here

529
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:02,439
It's pretty nice and it's a lot nicer than this

530
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,239
And like I said, we weren't going to sell this for 80 dollars. That would be fucking

531
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,590
I would I we've no way not going to happen. So here are the dice

532
01:13:09,829 --> 01:13:20,180
I don't know if I can even show these that well, but here they are these dice they have can you see

533
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:28,119
There's the the print is the light's not great in here, but there's the the j

534
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:38,800
The the germa j these are fun for all your dice needs. Yeah, you can't see it

535
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:48,390
It's it's it doesn't come out that well on camera here, but they're themed dice pretty cool

536
01:13:48,789 --> 01:13:56,710
So those sit in here like that and these I think these come in a little bag

537
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:05,159
They they will come in a little bag so they don't jump around too much and then

538
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:14,319
Aha is the manual the manual is right here. I don't want to show I should I open this

539
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:30,210
It's really nice. It's nice. It's kind of like acts as like a little art book too in a way

540
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:33,039
It's not an art book

541
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:36,340
But you know, they they there's a lot it's a listen

542
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:41,760
There's a lot of nice stuff in here and take a look there you go, but now this is not an art book

543
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:48,470
Let me make that really clear not an art book. It's the manual the rules for the game

544
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:54,239
But there is like some nice stuff here. Then

545
01:14:55,699 --> 01:15:08,800
Here there are two play mats here is one of the play mats and this is just standard

546
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,520
Paper, this is not uh, like felt or something. But here's the play mat is one of them

547
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:30,689
They're pretty big and then here's the other one. They're not like felt. Here you go. Here's the

548
01:15:31,329 --> 01:15:38,579
Here's the other one pretty cool pretty cool stuff and then

549
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:49,909
That's also in that box and then we get to these these are my favorite. This is my favorite part these

550
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,569
So I can't open these there's nothing in here

551
01:15:54,579 --> 01:15:56,579
I just want to get you to see what it looks like in somebody's hand

552
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:06,479
They feel nice. The foils are cool. Take a look back. Can you get a good view? Take a look at that

553
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:12,680
There it is

554
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:19,829
These are your packs two of these come in the box. They come in the box and why don't we

555
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:23,220
No, that's my favorite part for sure

556
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:31,109
Oh also very important to mention all the cards. This is all printed and made in america

557
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:33,829
The only difference is the dice were not the dice were made in china

558
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:39,000
so everything that this whole thing was made and printed in the united states, so

559
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:44,149
That's that's cool. There you go card reveal

560
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:52,720
Is one pretty shiny feels pretty good

561
01:16:53,779 --> 01:16:57,720
Give you kind of kind of a look of what they look like in somebody's hand

562
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:07,510
But if I get it really close, I wonder if I can get it close for you

563
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:23,600
And again, these are standard these are standard playing card sizes. Hey haven't even fucking seen this one yet

564
01:17:24,689 --> 01:17:32,470
You haven't even seen this one yet card reveal the lighting in the room is not great

565
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:37,989
But so this is a rare I don't have any holographics to show because they're being made so I can't really show them

566
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:45,880
But this is what one looks like you want to see the back if it looks like on the back

567
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:55,670
You know if you want to hear you want to sound test sound test flip test row test

568
01:17:55,989 --> 01:18:12,720
I'm gonna move it around pretty sturdy pretty solid. There you go. You want me to fan it out taste test

569
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:22,600
Oh, wait, let me show this. This is glue man

570
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:32,119
I wish the camera wasn't so bad because this it they actually the printing came out really nicely for yeah

571
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:36,579
It's full art. Yeah, the rares, uh, i've learned the rares the

572
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:43,409
Challenger cards, I believe are full right make sure make sure somebody corrects me. Can you see it?

573
01:18:43,409 --> 01:18:56,609
Well, there you go. Throw it at the wall. No, this is my glue man. I'm not doing that. You crazy

574
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:04,689
Yeah, I just we wanted to show people what because I look I get it. It's 80 fucking dollars

575
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:11,670
It's 10 bucks per pack. I I want you to be able to understand what you're getting. So let's fan it out

576
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:19,750
Sorry, i'm looking over here. I have to look at the preview to make sure i'm showing it right there you go

577
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:30,210
That's what you can expect printed and made in america except for the dice

578
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:41,239
It's been it's been quite a journey. There you go. What happens if you rip the mats?

579
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:47,829
I would just be careful with them. Be careful with them. Oh also. Yeah, very very important to remember as well

580
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:55,109
That there are two full decks that are coming with this box. I just I don't have them here right now

581
01:19:56,439 --> 01:19:58,039
they're not we

582
01:19:58,039 --> 01:20:01,800
I did we had printing stuff and they're they're making them. They're they're producing them

583
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,439
But we these are just samples of the boxes and some of the cards

584
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:11,779
So there are two full decks that will be sitting in these little wells and then everything will sit on top

585
01:20:11,859 --> 01:20:23,539
Actually, i'll show you what it might look like when you open it probably a good idea hold everything back up

586
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:31,750
There are duplicates. Yes, there are the game

587
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:36,229
So besides this being channel merch because that's what this is

588
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:43,250
We wanted a good functioning game on top of it because why not like i've got originally this was going to be baseball cards

589
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:48,720
In quotes, so this was originally just going to be no game

590
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,920
We got in touch with the game designer and it was like why not let's go

591
01:20:52,739 --> 01:20:55,359
Why not just have something fun on top of it, too?

592
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:57,699
so there are

593
01:20:57,699 --> 01:21:03,779
You can have duplicates in a deck and it's the game the game wise it makes sense because I think you can have up to three

594
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:10,239
Cards, right up to three the same card. I gotta fold this up. Nice. I don't want to mess it up

595
01:21:13,539 --> 01:21:20,579
So in the starter deck there are duplicates because they are pre-built decks for you to just be able to play it or just collect it

596
01:21:20,819 --> 01:21:34,850
So the decks in there are pre-built. I gotta fold this. I'm so paranoid. I'm gonna rip it because I don't want to let

597
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:43,670
This is my special sample copy. I don't want to mess it up. They're pretty sturdy though because it feels like it

598
01:21:43,909 --> 01:21:55,439
There we go. What do they smell like? I don't know nothing. Uh that moon by the way

599
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,399
That moon card comes in the starter kit

600
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:01,079
So that's good to know if you want that card

601
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:05,479
It's in the starter kit my card the germa card is also in the starter kit as well

602
01:22:08,789 --> 01:22:14,159
Would you like to see how far we've come?

603
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:23,880
This is from the stream. Do you remember this? Yeah, these are these are from the these are from the stream

604
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:29,560
Do you remember the stream? These are not I would say these are not bad

605
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,850
You know, they're a little the cut is a little we did this happened by

606
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:41,560
Yeah, archaeologist don't bend it. I'm not I just want to show you the difference. I want to show you the difference

607
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:52,479
I'm not bending them that hard. Yeah, two different pre-built decks two different decks. You don't get two of the same one

608
01:22:52,479 --> 01:23:04,199
It's two different pre-built decks. There you go. You want to see the difference might as well show the difference, right?

609
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:12,689
So the one on the left is the original the one on the right is the new the new one

610
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:18,149
The new card I guess you could say the new what it looks like actually that better idea to show it like this

611
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:26,819
Did you get a good idea of what like the first original on the stream looked like there we go

612
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:43,430
So this one on the left is the the ones we're printing one of the right is the original and again printed and made in america

613
01:23:43,670 --> 01:24:00,600
I want to make that point clear in the united states of america. Oh, I dropped them my precious my precious samples

614
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:10,289
So between the two starter decks that you get there are I believe there are 40 unique cards

615
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:16,529
Because they're doubles they have to have doubles for the game sense, right? There's 84 cards total in each

616
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:23,000
Across the two starter decks. So there you go. I

617
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:26,880
More than 40 unique cards. Sorry

618
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,149
I'm just i'm looking I gotta get corrected by the ground abuse group chat

619
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:39,010
And then you get the two boosters in there too, which is another 20 cards. There you go. Pick them up

620
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:52,720
I they've they've fallen in a perfect position pinned tweet pinned tweet. Thank you for the demonstration. Mr

621
01:24:52,720 --> 01:25:03,430
Jeremy will this be on the test if it's more than it was more than a it's more than a four. It's on the test

622
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:25,079
Thanks our grotto beast nfts. No, what's up saying that look I like this this it's cool

623
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:29,189
All right. There you go. I want to show it now you see kind of what's in the box

624
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:36,659
Unfortunately, the two pre-built starter decks are not there as well as any of the cards that obviously because we don't have that

625
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:43,220
I don't have them here. There you go. Are there any questions before we move on?

626
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:45,380
I want to make sure we answer most of the stuff right now

627
01:25:54,770 --> 01:26:01,039
Why did I how am I going to answer any of these when are they shipping?

628
01:26:01,779 --> 01:26:03,380
All right grotto beast group chat

629
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:07,140
Give me a hand here because we're having a pre-sale go for the next probably two weeks

630
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:14,199
After the pre-sale ends the inventory that we've already have in production right now will be part of the first things to ship out

631
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:19,380
Again, if you are buying boosters right now

632
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:26,949
You are claiming the second run of production because the first run of production has already been claimed

633
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,680
How many total unique cards are there 200?

634
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:50,420
There are 200 unique cards. Is it feasibly possible to collect everything?

635
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:55,720
That is a good question. I think the purpose with this was

636
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:58,640
to be interesting merch and

637
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:02,640
We don't really have a plan as of right now and what we're going to do in the future with this

638
01:27:03,699 --> 01:27:15,840
So I don't know. I guess maybe I it's a great question because it's a limited run as well. What's the calorie count?

639
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,640
Yes, the pre-sale is going to ship out shortly after the pre-sale ends

640
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:26,640
So in a couple of weeks just check back every so often

641
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:32,920
Well, i'm guys i'm going to be talking about this every five or six days until every like but that's way too long

642
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:36,180
I'll be talking about this every day or two on stream

643
01:27:36,819 --> 01:27:41,539
Until the pre-sale is over again. The point of the pre-sale is even though we've gone through

644
01:27:42,439 --> 01:27:44,609
our production inventory

645
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:50,899
Of boosters. I didn't want it to say well, it's sold out and that's it

646
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,439
And sorry, but we went through our inventory and that's it. We have to contact the printer

647
01:27:56,979 --> 01:28:02,600
Reprint do a second run but keep the pre-sale open so you can still claim it at the price

648
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:09,010
We are showing you if we didn't if it was just that one run and we didn't kind of keep this pre-sale going

649
01:28:09,569 --> 01:28:12,119
Then two or three weeks from now

650
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:14,119
I don't want these to appear for you know

651
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:18,819
The price that we a price that we are not telling you to pay weeks down the road

652
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:24,579
We want whoever wants this over the coming two or three weeks to be able to claim

653
01:28:24,979 --> 01:28:32,399
Product for the price that we are telling you so over these two and a half weeks or so

654
01:28:34,149 --> 01:28:38,470
We're keeping a pre-sale going regardless if we run out of production inventory

655
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:48,210
How long is a pre-sale at least for at least 10 to 14 more days at least there you go

656
01:28:48,449 --> 01:29:02,770
Will you play it on stream? You will absolutely see this be shown on stream. I can't say i'm very good

657
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:05,109
Good

658
01:29:05,109 --> 01:29:07,109
It's very it's fun though. It's very fun

659
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:19,010
and then another couple weeks we'll have maybe something else to talk about and

660
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:24,560
Show you but from now, we're really happy

661
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,659
It seems like people are into it and that was a big fear is is

662
01:29:28,899 --> 01:29:32,100
Are people and all the production costs and everything is this like people?

663
01:29:32,579 --> 01:29:39,029
Kind of actually care about this and the answer apparently is yes. So thanks everybody

664
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:44,289
We're all you you cannot understand the the excitement going on over here everyone. That's just

665
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:49,569
So happy with the reception and we hope you like it. We hope you think it's a good enough quality

666
01:29:49,569 --> 01:29:51,880
we really hope you do and

667
01:29:52,659 --> 01:30:04,899
It's it's merch. It's channel merch and that's pretty much the way that it is. It's very

668
01:30:05,619 --> 01:30:17,350
Different channel merch, but it is merch nonetheless and any plans on this project going forward. We don't have

669
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:21,840
There's no plans right now. We don't want to talk about any plans

670
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:28,390
Because we need to see how this goes this is uncharted territory for everybody over here

671
01:30:28,869 --> 01:30:41,750
So we're trying trying we're trying to figure it out. This guy sucks at grotto beasts

672
01:30:46,789 --> 01:30:50,710
What happened to the pin tweet? I deleted it because I need to make room for another one

673
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:02,119
I hope it makes it big

674
01:31:02,119 --> 01:31:04,920
Well, and again, I that's fucking cool

675
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:11,729
That's really really cool. I I can't even believe that that's something that somebody would even utter but remember

676
01:31:12,369 --> 01:31:18,819
It's fun channel merch first and foremost. We made this for you guys. We made this for this community

677
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,680
That was the intent that was the purpose and whatever people do with it

678
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:32,640
Whatever people think whatever how much fun people have with it. Cool. That's awesome. That makes all of us happy and we'll see

679
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:42,500
Let's go back to hylix. Although

680
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:45,119
I got i'm gonna i gotta pee

681
01:31:45,119 --> 01:37:20,710
I'll be right back. I'm gonna go pee. Okay

682
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:23,270
I am back

683
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:27,109
Sorry, I was gone for a little bit. I wanted to refill my little drink I have here

684
01:37:27,989 --> 01:37:29,939
I also wanted to

685
01:37:29,939 --> 01:37:38,420
Just kind of corroborate with the grotto beast team make sure everything I said was accurate. Cool. Oh, there's no music. I'm sorry

686
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:45,909
Should have been this

687
01:37:45,909 --> 01:37:47,510
Well, I did pee

688
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:53,239
I peed and then I was like, hey, let's ask a couple of questions to make sure I got this right

689
01:37:53,800 --> 01:38:05,810
Okie dokie. Let's play

690
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:16,819
Hylix so what's the last thing we just did right? Okay. I came here. I did this

691
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:25,670
I'm gonna go to that place where I was before down here. Oh, I don't need to go in this

692
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:38,069
Don't you dare tell me that I need to relax. Well, i'm saying what I

693
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:45,220
I'm relaxing right now. Okay

694
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:58,770
I think I could fight these things now. Can I I should be strong enough? I'm doing it. Oh shit

695
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:16,579
I forgot to sleep vibe check. I think the vibes are pretty great. Uh, I need to heal

696
01:39:27,300 --> 01:40:04,720
That hurt two damage don't do it. No, I think i'm all right. Jesus this hurts. Oh

697
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:18,050
I could revive but no, I only have one of those shit

698
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:32,439
Kind of in trouble

699
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:39,750
deal

700
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:58,560
I think i'll survive. Yeah, i'm all right. These things hurt the sauce still says you're in the bathroom

701
01:41:00,359 --> 01:41:04,520
Well, the stream is live right now if that's for only when the stream is offline

702
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:30,470
600 bucks damn. Okay. Hold on. This is we need to heal. Wait, he's just dead. Oh

703
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:47,479
I have to use the burrito. All right

704
01:41:56,899 --> 01:41:59,569
What the fuck are you guys doing over here?

705
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:08,550
I'm not gonna even i'm not i'm not gonna show that because it's stupid

706
01:42:15,329 --> 01:42:21,250
No, if you i'm no i'm not even gonna address it it's it's a stupid meme that somebody did in the discord

707
01:42:21,489 --> 01:42:36,100
I'm not doing that. I can't i'm playing a game right now. I can't show it tv

708
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:49,670
I don't even understand what this meme is

709
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:55,920
What is this meme trying to what is this meme? Can somebody explain this to me? I don't get it

710
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,800
I mean I get it what they're doing, but I don't get it at the same time

711
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:07,460
Bernie watching a video of me with cigarette packs smoking a cigarette. I don't get it

712
01:43:07,539 --> 01:43:12,479
I don't understand this and i'm not showing it. I'm just not gonna show it. I don't get it

713
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:54,529
I don't get what does this mean? Fine. I'll show it. What is this supposed to be? I I don't get it

714
01:44:00,869 --> 01:44:12,039
I understand this

715
01:44:12,039 --> 01:44:30,520
Does anybody get it?

716
01:44:31,699 --> 01:44:36,520
All right. I don't want to die. I don't want to lose here. I gotta pay attention. I activated that crystal, right?

717
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:48,100
Yeah, I don't think there's anything to get necessarily. I I don't get it. I I I don't get it

718
01:44:48,100 --> 01:45:12,159
I don't get this. I don't get this. We're gonna kill one real quick right now. You're not gonna die again, right?

719
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:32,529
You know, you're gonna die again. What he's a full health. Why'd he die so quickly bro? You suck

720
01:45:32,770 --> 01:45:39,010
No, I I gotta pay attention people are sending me bernie sanders like smoking memes of me holding cigarette packs

721
01:45:39,329 --> 01:45:41,329
I'm a little distracted right now

722
01:45:50,960 --> 01:46:03,170
No, no, it's fine. I am kind of in trouble though

723
01:46:03,489 --> 01:46:11,060
I think I have to die because then I can put them turn the meat in right? Let's maybe that's not a bad thing

724
01:46:15,539 --> 01:46:32,369
Parasite crystal. Whoa, i'm the sage of computers. I grant you my token sage's token. Okay, there's one more token

725
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:44,119
What about this?

726
01:46:44,119 --> 01:46:50,100
Cool. Okay, so I have this token. I am terrified of this thing

727
01:46:50,500 --> 01:47:21,909
I don't have a revive check the right side and then i'll probably leave that's the only way

728
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:32,340
I don't want to fight this thing. Oh shit

729
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:52,020
What no, I thought I dodged it. All right, i'll be all right just die. It's fine

730
01:47:52,579 --> 01:47:54,819
But I want to be able to get all the secrets

731
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,760
Germa i'm crunk right now. I think you're cool

732
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:16,789
I appreciate it. Thanks stunned can't do anything

733
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:32,920
No, I thought I was gonna be dead

734
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:50,800
Are you scrunk

735
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:58,609
No

736
01:48:58,609 --> 01:49:01,649
They explained to the bernie meme in the discord. Oh, okay

737
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:08,739
What's the last time you played with playdoh?

738
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:11,079
That would have to be

739
01:49:11,079 --> 01:49:12,680
at least

740
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:14,439
25 years ago

741
01:49:14,439 --> 01:49:30,359
Dynamite wait, this is safe. No, you lied to me. You lied to me

742
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:36,949
I'm actually I feel betrayed right now. You lied to me. You said red line and that was a you lied to me

743
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:42,229
Oh

744
01:49:42,229 --> 01:49:47,409
I'm definitely dead

745
01:49:47,409 --> 01:50:03,590
Oh shit going no way. Goodbye. I do have a ton of meat though. All right, I gotta come back here

746
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:38,289
22 meat your max flesh rose, but okay 44 extra health is huge. It's so cool and freaky. It is cool

747
01:50:38,529 --> 01:50:48,720
It is cool and freaky the executive balcony is down the stairs only those who have died three times are allowed there

748
01:50:49,569 --> 01:50:52,689
Uh, I guess you qualify good job. You may proceed

749
01:50:55,199 --> 01:51:07,060
Nice job swish swish axe found. Ooh

750
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:23,000
Time steals away like a stream. We glide hence away. I need a paper cup. That's extra mana who can use that

751
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:36,739
Okay, so this is a ton of damage but no nothing on it greatly increases maximum will points

752
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:42,920
Oh, I don't think I want that right now, but I definitely will take this

753
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:07,840
Maybe I should be like castor in a way how much more that's a lot. That's an unbelievable amount

754
01:52:10,899 --> 01:52:21,699
Yeah, I think i'll keep it on well if I get a paper cup

755
01:52:21,699 --> 01:52:36,739
I gotta remember where that is, but let me sleep on the cup. There we go

756
01:52:36,899 --> 01:52:45,670

760
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:22,899

01:55:30,449 --> 01:55:32,630
I don't know what it meant by that

766
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:37,270
Everything this game is so wacky looking. I didn't know that. I don't know. I don't know what that thing was

767
01:55:37,670 --> 01:56:08,720
300 bucks nice. All right. Well, I got everything here. I got everything here. So where have I not gone?

768
01:56:11,399 --> 01:56:16,710
I guess I could walk around out here. Have I explored all this area yet?

769
01:56:16,949 --> 01:56:40,210
No, there was that big that like big vault. I wonder if i'm strong enough orange

01:58:03,039 --> 01:58:18,050
I just kind of don't remember where he was. Where do I go over there? Where do I go?

775
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,869
It's green. Where do I go?

776
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:46,710
Teleporter in the skull maze. Well, I would need to die right just go to green die and go to green

777
01:58:46,869 --> 01:58:56,159
It's in the middle

778
01:58:56,159 --> 01:59:12,050
Uh, okay go to the warp station. I think I don't have to be dead to be at the warp station

782
02:00:33,329 --> 02:00:48,640
I wonder what the strategy here is take out the ads first. Yeah, and then let's do a panorama

783
02:00:49,199 --> 02:01:08,229
All right, that hurts a lot

784
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:09,109
shit

785
02:01:09,109 --> 02:01:19,840
There you go. Just don't die

786
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:32,310
Nope

787
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:44,260
I think we're okay

788
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:45,380
Jesus

789
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:52,289

Oh, thank god one health. Damn. Okay

793
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:39,279
The one on the right has been confused almost the whole time. I think we're good

794
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:55,750
That's not gonna cause a problem, right if I don't kill the ads first

795
02:02:56,550 --> 02:02:58,949
Oh, all right. Let's do it. There's a lot of money back there

796
02:02:59,510 --> 02:03:09,960
22 damage. That's it

797
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:25,680

805
02:04:51,319 --> 02:04:53,560
1080p 60 is too large for that barrier to look good

806
02:04:54,819 --> 02:05:01,170
Well, you can make 1080 1080 6 uh, 1080 30. This is fine. 1080 60 is okay, too

807
02:05:01,569 --> 02:05:12,359

02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:38,020
Sensible everyday wear for the modern machine prevents paralysis

artificial bicep

916
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:53,920
Are we the poncho there? Right toilet paper is very awful

917
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,120
141 versus

918
02:30:01,090 --> 02:30:08,870
Yeah, it's better. Telepaper really does not do anything. You can I can optimize too if I really wanted to

919
02:30:09,670 --> 02:30:13,600
Well, there we go. That's fun

920
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:35,000
Back to it. So now I can leave the leave the dock thoughts on the game so far. I think it's great

921
02:30:35,399 --> 02:30:51,809
Didn't want to do that. It's kind of like

922
02:30:51,870 --> 02:30:58,420
Earthbound went through a bunch of I mean, it's like a really cool art piece

923
02:30:58,739 --> 02:31:05,600
The music's really cool and it plays sort of like that earthbound kind of the party and do you have to I mean

924
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:14,760
It's I like it. It's really cool. Did I explore everything here? I believe the answer to that question is yes

925
02:31:25,989 --> 02:31:33,559
Correct. It is an rpg, right? But it's it's like a television screen rpg. Here's what I mean by that

926
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:37,989
When you get into a battle your party members are not on the screen

927
02:31:39,170 --> 02:31:42,979
It's just you you're like a pov

928
02:31:44,479 --> 02:32:05,350
RPG pov traditional turn-based rpg dragon quest does this and like and like the like the psychedelic powers and stuff

929
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:22,040
I mean, that's earthbound just happened. Whoa, where am I? What's going on?

930
02:32:22,850 --> 02:32:32,020
Whoa, what just happened wane wrongfully prepares many behaviors, but doth he sniff his vessel near truths

931
02:32:32,260 --> 02:32:39,959
Digest the offending doom in prisons consider the dirt. Meanwhile at the moon palace gibby pilots

932
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:46,020
Soon our shrunken radiance will be greatly shunned. Every pain is a

933
02:32:46,659 --> 02:32:48,559
Whatever that word is

934
02:32:48,559 --> 02:33:10,870
Monculus and every chemical is like melancholy biscuit. What does it do? I just punched that thing. Should I not be doing this pneumatic?

940
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:13,959

What does that mean?

943
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:35,670
Okay, permanently increases mightiness by two. I feel like it's going to be wane, right? Give wane the heaviest attacks

944
02:35:35,909 --> 02:36:05,270

03:42:24,059 --> 03:42:28,750
Is that just an item?

1206
03:42:28,750 --> 03:42:38,190
No, it's an outfit. Wait, why can I not put it on? Oh, it's because of that. This is okay

1207
03:42:40,799 --> 03:42:41,920

Should I trade the I think i'm gonna trade this thing's very deadly, right?

1211
03:42:58,000 --> 03:43:00,690
curious

1212
03:43:02,700 --> 03:43:04,700
Yeah, look at this shit

1213
03:43:04,860 --> 03:43:30,299
101 mightiness prevent negative status. Okay, wayne's gonna be the absolute destroyer actual bicep. It's fine

1214
03:43:31,629 --> 03:43:43,860
Even I want the demon skull artificial bicep is fine. I think this is all good. Wait, maybe now

1215
03:43:44,180 --> 03:43:59,120
I think i'm good with this or is it time to take the combat bell off of make them a little better

1216
03:44:01,950 --> 03:44:07,950
What the hell is that emote? Wayne's garb is useless now

1218
03:44:43,629 --> 03:44:59,139
I have 32 heels. I think i'll be fine. Is this thing in the middle?

1219
03:45:06,899 --> 03:45:18,350
One more place up there. It's like a big castle through this irl. I did I did

1220
03:45:23,389 --> 03:45:30,139
This irl what is going on here?

1221
03:45:31,569 --> 03:45:49,950
It must be the new foreman check in with claw man before you head to the lab

1222
03:45:50,270 --> 03:45:59,870
You're not allowed to enter the lab without claw man's permission

1223
03:45:59,870 --> 03:46:23,040
It would look to be claw man if I were to guess nice to finally meet you if you'll just give me the password

1224
03:46:23,040 --> 03:46:31,309
I can get you set up in the lab vessel from did you forget it or something?

1225
03:46:31,309 --> 03:46:42,000
I'll give you another chance. What's the password pneumatic art? They keep saying pneumatic. Maybe it's pneumatic

1226
03:46:42,000 --> 03:46:53,120
They keep saying that i'm gonna say pneumatic art. Not that either. Stop joking around. This is your final chance

1227
03:46:53,360 --> 03:46:56,370
I mean, they're all these are all random

1228
03:46:58,360 --> 03:47:09,219
Insect who are you prepare to be destroyed? Okay and begin

1229
03:47:11,790 --> 03:47:21,629
might increase

1230
03:47:21,629 --> 03:47:27,010
confusion bubbles

1231
03:47:31,139 --> 03:47:35,260
Dark flame no ancient odor. No dark flame

1232
03:47:39,090 --> 03:47:53,100
Um confused. Nope. All right. That's it. The poison's doing great. All right now detonate

1233
03:47:53,659 --> 03:48:05,739
This is gonna be a huge number

1234
03:48:05,739 --> 03:48:06,620
Oh

1235
03:48:06,620 --> 03:48:13,090
Shit, that's bad

1236
03:48:13,629 --> 03:48:30,010
377 I think should I revive?

1237
03:48:30,110 --> 03:48:37,889
Jesus. Oh my god. This is fucking destructive. I need to do a group heal

1238
03:48:43,649 --> 03:48:51,200
Shit. Oh my god. It's bad

1239
03:48:52,079 --> 03:48:54,079
This thing is destructive

1240
03:48:54,620 --> 03:48:57,409
destructive

1241
03:48:57,409 --> 03:48:59,809
Uh, I I don't think I was prepared for this

1242
03:49:00,610 --> 03:49:12,000
What is the speed on this guy?

1243
03:49:21,200 --> 03:49:22,479
Yes

1244
03:49:22,479 --> 03:49:23,520
Yes

1245
03:49:23,520 --> 03:49:25,520
Obviously, I went for it. I just went for it

1246
03:49:28,540 --> 03:49:37,360
10 000 bucks. I I went for it. Hell. Yeah

1247
03:49:45,149 --> 03:49:47,790
Uh, I don't want to revive yet because I might be able to bring them back

1248
03:49:48,590 --> 03:49:54,350
Beside his microcosm

1249
03:49:54,430 --> 03:49:57,120
Avenge beside it

1250
03:49:57,120 --> 03:49:58,799
All right. I I got permission

1251
03:49:58,799 --> 03:50:19,020
It's the lab these enemies. You must be the new guy the machines have been prepared. So feel free to give them a whirl

1252
03:50:19,659 --> 03:50:34,559
I'll never get tired of watching the machine do its thing. I selected these specimens for their exceptionally high monetization potential

1253
03:50:35,040 --> 03:51:01,600
Let's smear spirit rapidly press all the buttons. I made money

1254
03:51:06,430 --> 03:51:07,709
250

1255
03:51:07,709 --> 03:51:13,629
Thousand dollars. What do I do with that money? What am I supposed to do with that?

1256
03:51:18,059 --> 03:51:46,049
Uh a half a million. I have seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars now now what does it go?

1257
03:51:46,690 --> 03:52:06,940
Buy every single thing in the store. That's all I can do here. I think that's it. Yeah, that's it

1258
03:52:08,299 --> 03:52:10,959
Seven hundred and seventy four thousand dollars. Holy shit

1259
03:52:12,159 --> 03:52:55,870
Okay. Well, whoo. I'm buying everything if it's in the store. I own it. Okay, the last token

1260
03:52:56,190 --> 03:53:10,930
Where's the last token? Maybe the place I haven't been yet. Actually, now I want to go to the other stores

1261
03:53:29,090 --> 03:53:34,579
Frito token is in that statue maze

1262
03:53:35,620 --> 03:53:36,659
Ah

1263
03:53:36,659 --> 03:54:04,860
I'll go back there. I guess I don't really need anything berry shield. I wish it gets just four of these

1264
03:54:06,219 --> 03:54:26,620
Roam bowler. I just get like two of them. I have so much money berry shield cooking greatly increases maximum health points

1265
03:54:26,620 --> 03:54:28,620
I wonder if I should give that to you

1266
03:54:41,819 --> 03:54:55,420
336

1267
03:54:55,420 --> 03:54:57,420
364 that's a lot actually

1268
03:55:02,020 --> 03:55:05,540
I'd rather them stay alive. Yeah, i'm gonna let them have it

1269
03:55:05,780 --> 03:55:13,379
Okay

1270
03:55:13,379 --> 03:55:22,579
I'm gonna go to the statue place because I want to see I want to see what happens. Don't use all the money

1271
03:55:23,340 --> 03:55:51,280
Um, I got seven hundred thousand dollars. All right back outside looking good. Let's go. It was over here

1272
03:55:52,239 --> 03:56:04,350
So i'm gonna say down and to the left. I did not go this way

1273
03:56:06,129 --> 03:56:26,399
Oh, there's nothing over there to the right should I go? Yeah, that's right trash can maybe oh shit bad

1274
03:56:26,719 --> 03:56:51,729
Okay paper cup. Where is it? Where is it? I'll probably I

1275
03:56:54,030 --> 03:56:57,790
Restart I might need to restart it

1276
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:28,299
I think I have to restart it. I'm dead. Whatever. Which one of these is it red one, right?

1277
03:57:28,540 --> 03:58:03,200
Oh like the like the very red one. Yeah, very red one. So where is it? Oh my god

1278
03:58:03,280 --> 03:58:39,520
You're screwing me here. Get out of the fucking way get that one stuck. How did you make it?

1279
03:58:39,760 --> 03:58:43,120
How did you do that? You were stuck all the way to the right, dude

1280
03:58:43,520 --> 03:59:12,819
How did you do? How did you do that? Shit? I'm just trying to bait him out of here. Oh, come on

1281
03:59:13,219 --> 03:59:20,670
No, I need to soak my right hand in warm water

1282
03:59:35,700 --> 03:59:51,170
Don't because my hand is sore. All right, all three of you come down this way

1283
03:59:55,379 --> 04:00:10,030
You better not we got it hot dog and a juice pack. I am the sage of death. I grant you my token

1284
04:00:11,420 --> 04:00:34,049
Take my siblings. All right, I got it. What the hell muscle times two

1285
04:00:51,489 --> 04:01:00,180
Thanks

1286
04:01:03,600 --> 04:01:09,040
You just kill me because I want to summon the um plane

1287
04:01:13,360 --> 04:01:19,229
The best place to summon the plane

1288
04:01:19,229 --> 04:01:41,360
Wait green these don't hurt me anymore. Can I do anything else on the right side? I can do here, right?

1289
04:01:50,420 --> 04:01:51,940
25 points

1290
04:01:51,940 --> 04:02:26,940
I don't think I can do anything else here, but they don't hurt me. So this was on that

1291
04:02:27,260 --> 04:02:39,940
Should I do this now? Why can I summon the airship should I do this later or do this now?

1292
04:02:42,850 --> 04:02:44,290
It's not going to end the game or anything, right?

1293
04:02:44,290 --> 04:02:56,129
Because there's this one spot up here that I have not been to go use the tokens now

1294
04:03:05,360 --> 04:03:21,100
I have to use the boat. Let's see you play the sequel 100. Yes

1295
04:03:21,739 --> 04:03:33,950
This has been a really enjoyable experience. I think it's great. I will 100 play the sequel. Okay

1296
04:03:34,590 --> 04:03:48,819
All the tokens are there as the tv say learned legend of melting the ultimate magic

1297
04:03:57,979 --> 04:04:01,739
Ultimate magic randomly strikes three times may briefly stun

1298
04:04:02,920 --> 04:04:07,200
200 mp the only one that can cast this is you

1299
04:04:12,430 --> 04:04:27,219
Damn sponsored stream. Why the hell would this be a sponsored stream? This game came out like fucking six years ago

1300
04:04:31,379 --> 04:04:36,399
What when did this game come out like 2000 fucking 16?

1301
04:04:37,719 --> 04:04:40,770
2013 how long is this game been out for?

1302
04:04:41,709 --> 04:04:51,280
It was eight years ago. That would be crazy

1303
04:04:51,840 --> 04:05:19,700
I'm ready

1304
04:05:19,700 --> 04:05:29,299
Whatever. This is we're seeing it. You got the sponsorship eight years ago and they were just really lenient on the time frame

1305
04:05:30,500 --> 04:05:38,059
Oh my god, that would be fucking awful. Yeah, I mean back when I was in the middle making youtube videos

1306
04:05:38,459 --> 04:05:44,750
Yeah, I just didn't have a time frame on it. It just said at some point in the future and I was like, yeah sure

1307
04:05:49,899 --> 04:05:58,879
Always read your contracts. That's what I will tell you. There was no time frame. That would be so fucked up

1308
04:06:00,000 --> 04:06:04,930
But no, this game's just really cool and we're doing just hanging out. We're just chilling

1309
04:06:05,250 --> 04:06:11,219
That's it. Can I introduce you in a hot dogs or perhaps a spaceship key? Yes

1310
04:06:13,680 --> 04:06:35,700
Uh, i'll take that. I gotta look at my money. I'm fucking loaded. I could buy two if I wanted. Oh shit

1311
04:06:35,940 --> 04:06:41,870
Um, I want to try this. I want to try the super attack. I'm gonna try the legend of melting. Let's see what it does

1312
04:06:42,350 --> 04:06:59,409
Okay

1313
04:06:59,409 --> 04:07:09,069
legend of melting

1314
04:07:09,069 --> 04:07:20,959
All right

1315
04:07:20,959 --> 04:07:31,500
Cool. This is the spaceship then spaceship is the end game. Uh

1316
04:07:32,299 --> 04:07:36,620
I think I think I did pretty much anything everything I could have done

1317
04:07:36,620 --> 04:07:41,280
Maybe there's probably some secrets I didn't see but I think I saw mostly everything

1318
04:07:42,530 --> 04:07:49,250
Yeah, I think I did everything. I've been to every island. I went to everything in the underground. Yeah, I did it all

1319
04:07:49,329 --> 04:08:16,340
Okay, let's turn the spaceship on. I'm just gonna buy an absolute shitload of hot dogs

1320
04:08:16,579 --> 04:08:30,100
Do I need six hundred thousand dollars? I'm just gonna buy a thousand of these and buy fifty of them

1321
04:08:30,260 --> 04:08:41,379
We'll buy juice in the city. Where do you buy juice? I didn't find a place to buy it

1322
04:08:47,620 --> 04:08:55,549
Was there a place in the city to buy juice? I didn't see it. Juice is only from kills

1323
04:08:55,709 --> 04:09:06,659
I think i'll be all right. I'm gonna buy like 10 of these or like 20. I got six hundred thousand dollars

1324
04:09:06,739 --> 04:09:58,690
Yeah, let's go. Let's do it. I'm ready. I haven't saved right before this so oh anything else wait

1325
04:09:58,690 --> 04:10:15,069
What about this little thing? Can I go this way? Have you ever tried cruelty squad? I have not seen cruelty squad

1326
04:10:15,389 --> 04:10:21,979
I'm not well, i've seen it, but i've not played it. I feel like that the game I know is awesome

1327
04:10:22,299 --> 04:10:27,299
I've been I've been told it's fucking awesome, but it looks a little harsh

1328
04:10:27,620 --> 04:10:33,360
Looks like my brain would probably get hurt like I would be like, uh, it would probably give me a headache

1329
04:10:34,379 --> 04:10:44,350
Let me ask you a question if I can handle this could I handle cruelty squad? I heard it's awesome

1330
04:10:44,750 --> 04:10:51,520
But yeah, you think so it gave me a headache gave me a headache

1331
04:10:52,079 --> 04:10:56,979
maybe you know what i'll do maybe i'll jump into it for like 20 minutes or so off stream to see how I feel because I

1332
04:10:57,809 --> 04:11:02,770
Believe it or not. I do have like audio visual stimulation that sometimes it can actually give me a headache

1333
04:11:04,159 --> 04:11:06,799
Sometimes dude, I tell you when I in the half-life 2 bolt level

1334
04:11:06,879 --> 04:11:09,760
I almost puked and I had to lie down on my floor for like 10 minutes in between

1335
04:11:11,069 --> 04:11:18,719
Bits of that game. I remember lying on my back on the floor should not throw up playing half-life 2

1336
04:11:18,879 --> 04:11:35,090
What's going on here? Do I have to fight all these? Entering the palace is forbidden leave now or be destroyed

1337
04:11:35,409 --> 04:11:38,420
You accidentally crushed it. Oh

1338
04:11:40,670 --> 04:11:50,399
Simmery axe inflicts

1339
04:11:51,280 --> 04:11:53,280
Electrobiological damage

1340
04:11:55,649 --> 04:12:04,219
I mean that's kind of all right. I can give this back to you. See this should go to sams nasa

1341
04:12:06,670 --> 04:12:08,670
Isn't it? Wait, why can't you use that?

1342
04:12:11,250 --> 04:12:43,069
It smells I can't use it interesting. Whoa. Okay. We're just wiping everybody out another tv

1343
04:12:46,430 --> 04:12:49,069
Exhaled he thrums despite refugent concavity

1344
04:12:50,100 --> 04:12:50,899
Oh

1345
04:12:50,899 --> 04:13:08,190
Can we sit on the couch juice pack good?

1346
04:13:20,909 --> 04:13:28,500
Boy, is there any other items in this room that i'm not seeing?

1347
04:13:29,379 --> 04:13:56,989
I can't tell why these guys were giving us trouble before why are we so powerful kind of unstoppable as the last crystal

1348
04:13:58,590 --> 04:14:02,879
Boy turn back. It's terribly powerful

1349
04:14:06,659 --> 04:14:09,280
Rehydrate out of blatantly mild

1350
04:14:25,659 --> 04:14:38,059
It's an orange. Is that what it is? It's like a moon an orange a what is this you dare approach me?

1351
04:14:38,700 --> 04:14:42,299
My theories will rescue your apparels until you beg me to consider

1352
04:14:43,809 --> 04:14:58,459
Now exhumed thine zesty nerve. It is the last time you will celebrate this box

1353
04:15:04,780 --> 04:15:07,340
Pack. Whoa, you've got other shit in this room

1389
04:23:53,290 --> 04:24:02,059
Or a hundred damage. Can I do it again? I cannot but i'll do this

04:25:46,940 --> 04:25:49,260
Uh bubbles because that's gonna be poison

04:25:50,590 --> 04:25:52,590
You eat a hot dog this time and you attack

1397
04:26:03,729 --> 04:26:05,569
999

1398
04:26:05,569 --> 04:26:11,299
Thousand bucks found a hot dog. Wayne is now level 63

Rock amidst a remarkable juice pick this person up and carry them out, but wane hideous luxuriously adrift

1408
04:27:23,299 --> 04:27:33,649
Witness the chemical amidst the delusion vacuum governments irradiance renders greatly the doth her homunculus pilot side rays

1409
04:27:34,930 --> 04:27:41,579
So ends the tale of the modified beasts who sought to witness yet sort of expansively texturized

1410
04:27:42,200 --> 04:28:04,750
Radiance the lever that I wasn't supposed to touch interesting the end

1411

Don't touch that lever. It makes the uh, am I missing something?

1414
04:28:24,590 --> 04:28:48,260

So what do we do now? What about that person that was walking around act one act two act three now spam the lever

1416
04:29:13,629 --> 04:29:41,899
It's no I didn't do it. That is the end with apologies. Why wait with apologies?

1417
04:29:42,379 --> 04:29:55,420
What was that? Remember event position more self switches knight runners variable display. Oh, it's I think it's random

1418
04:29:55,659 --> 04:30:04,110
That was really cool. That was a very enjoyable game

1419
04:30:06,270 --> 04:30:12,909
Oh, what's this? Well, that's it. There isn't anything more. Shall we return to the main menu?

1420
04:30:13,309 --> 04:30:16,899
Okay, let's just chill out here for a while

1421
04:30:23,700 --> 04:30:26,659

Is there any like super boss that I have to kill because now I have a ton of hp or something

1429
04:31:15,170 --> 04:31:16,850
Or is that just kind of it?

1430
04:31:16,850 --> 04:31:34,379
Spell the end with the letters. Um, I did that's the game. Well, that was cool. All right, well done

1431
04:31:34,700 --> 04:31:37,780
Let's see what happens. Is it gonna be? Yeah, there it is

1432
04:31:39,010 --> 04:31:45,659
That was hylix 1 we are going to absolutely play hylix 2. I like that. That was cool. I liked it a lot

1433
04:31:55,329 --> 04:31:57,329
so is hylix 2

1434
04:31:57,409 --> 04:32:03,540
a direct sequel or is it just hylix but a different is this a

1435
04:32:05,379 --> 04:32:07,459
Yes, it's a direct sequel. I just didn't know if it was some kind of

1436
04:32:09,409 --> 04:32:23,860
Standalone experience or something. Do we get any more info? Don't tell me it's a dumb thing to ask before playing it. But yeah

1437
04:32:24,420 --> 04:32:26,690
awesome

1438
04:32:26,690 --> 04:32:33,069
Hylix currently three dollars on steam right now game's been off for a long time

1439
04:32:33,149 --> 04:32:39,739
But a lot of people have been uh requesting I play this for a while and we'll definitely play the second one, too

1440
04:32:43,569 --> 04:32:48,829
That's a steal. Yeah, I mean like that's

1441
04:32:49,700 --> 04:33:01,340
That was a four like three and a half hour four hour experience two bucks. Come on gwen. I liked it a lot

1442
04:33:16,000 --> 04:33:21,630
Second hylix when four out of ten what? Wait, wait, wait, wait. What what happened?

1443
04:33:23,099 --> 04:33:26,540
Why people saying four to ten omega l what did I say that? When did I do that?

1444
04:33:26,860 --> 04:33:34,599
What you said it's a it was a miscommunication

1445
04:33:36,700 --> 04:33:40,779
Oh four hours. Okay. I was like what that's not correct

1446
04:33:47,310 --> 04:33:51,439
Yeah, I I don't I can't give this game a rating. I don't think it

1447
04:33:51,759 --> 04:34:03,540
I don't think I want to I think I would just say this is a recommended experience because to me

1448
04:34:06,880 --> 04:34:08,880
It was it was a great time

1449
04:34:08,959 --> 04:34:14,619
But I don't think that the experience that I had here I could be like well, let me say uh x out of 10

1450
04:34:15,380 --> 04:34:17,380
No, no, it was just great. It was just really cool

1451
04:34:23,419 --> 04:34:27,659
But like I gave you okay if you want it to be rated if this has to be a rating for you

1452
04:34:29,200 --> 04:34:32,720
This is for the experience for the experience

1453
04:34:35,099 --> 04:34:44,799
It is a it is a good plus good plus i'm not giving this a number rating

1454
04:34:44,880 --> 04:34:50,930
I don't think you can I think it's just a good plus which means that was fucking fun. That was great

1455
04:34:51,169 --> 04:35:04,029
This game was in a museum as a demo

1456
04:35:06,240 --> 04:35:10,799
Yeah, this game was to me was like more of like a an art journey and like an experience

1457
04:35:11,119 --> 04:35:26,369
That was good plus good plus what's what about good plus plus?

1458
04:35:27,569 --> 04:35:35,490
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this was great. This was great plus

1459
04:35:37,229 --> 04:35:41,790
All right. I'm getting out of here. It was a very wonderful experience highly recommended

1460
04:35:41,790 --> 04:35:49,729
It's only three dollars and I can't wait to play the second one. I loved it

1461
04:35:49,970 --> 04:35:57,259
And that's gonna be the end of stream. I think it's a good place to call it

1462
04:35:57,340 --> 04:36:11,380
I'm gonna go eat some pizza. Well done. But yeah, I will see you guys the next time you will see me

04:37:38,159 --> 04:37:42,459
