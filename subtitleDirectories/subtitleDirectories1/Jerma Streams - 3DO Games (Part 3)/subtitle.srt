1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:03,620
Good afternoon, good afternoon, good afternoon. Sorry I'm late, sorry.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,289
Something came up last second that I just had to take care of.

3
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:14,439
Care of it? Everything's good? We're ready to go. Sorry I was, uh, late.

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:23,820
Sorry. Don't apologize, welcome. Hey, thank you. Hey, look at that.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:34,920
When are we gonna do porn week? Uh, that's every week, man.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,179
Keep apologizing. Where is New Vegas? What do you mean New Vegas?

7
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:46,789
Like Fallout New Vegas? Are you trying to tell me to continue a playthrough of a

8
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:53,590
game that I stopped four years ago during my do I like live streaming trial

9
00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:02,039
period? Yes. You know, it's kind of funny.

10
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,250
If I did that same save file is still here. I could probably open it and I'd be

11
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,650
sitting at the door that we were at four years ago.

12
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,170
Should I just open it and pretend like it's been not even a day?

13
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,989
Okay, so last, uh, last week we were here. Pretty cool adventure so far.

14
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:23,560
I would have no idea where I was even going. I can't do that.

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,140
But hello, welcome. We're gonna be doing, uh, I did a poll

16
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,819
before the stream started. We're gonna be doing Psychic Detective.

17
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:39,640
It is a meaty 3DO game. It is an FMV adventure, from what I understand.

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,409
I heard it's crazy and you know how much we love our FMV games on this channel.

19
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:54,340
You know it as much as I do. This game is three discs long, which back

20
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,480
in the mid-90s, a three to four disc game

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,060
was like every Lord of the Rings movie back to back.

22
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,099
That was a huge amount of stuff. It was insane to know that that was the case.

23
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:16,439
If a game had more than one disc, you knew you were in for it. This is a new mic?

24
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:24,180
No. I'm just sitting a little closer. Look out, Jerma. This could be a porn game.

25
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,240
It's not a porn game. It's a detective game. It's not a

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,960
porn game. Turn your face cam on. Don't have any clothes on?

27
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,900
Don't have a face cam. Sorry, guys. Just imagine what I look like right now.

28
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:50,939
There's a couple other games that are FMVs that I cannot wait to play on this

29
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:59,349
ancient dinosaur device of a console. I'm not going to tell you what they are.

30
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:07,189
You'll experience them with me as we do. Psychic porn.

31
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:12,120
All right, let's go. Psychic Detective, welcome everybody.

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,719
This will be, I do want to say this though, as of today

33
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,879
we're going to put a little cool down period on the 3DO in the last three

34
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,689
streams in a row. So we're going to put the 3DO away for a

35
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:27,139
week or so. We'll come back to it. It's always here.

36
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,099
It's available. We'll do something else this coming week.

37
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:36,919
All right, let's go. Psychic Detective. Oh, by the way, I want to make sure I

38
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:42,599
start saying this more frequently. FTK is not canceled. FTK is going to

39
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,680
happen on October 3rd. That is the date for it.

40
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,740
October 3rd. I think I mentioned the 26th before, but no, no, no, no, no.

41
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:01,210
October 3rd, 3 p.m. Pacific. It is not canceled.

42
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,419
I saw you on my recommended, on my first, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

43
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:09,020
Saw you on my recommended. This is my first stream. Pog.

44
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:19,220
Can we get a warm welcome for Poinster? This is their first stream ever.

45
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:29,079
Phantom. Hey, welcome to your first stream ever.

46
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:35,829
That's the Pog. We, and by the way, we do this for all new viewers.

47
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:40,819
He doesn't know that we do this for everybody. Are you ready for the

48
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:44,779
sing the welcome song? Okay, here we go guys. You know it. You

49
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,500
guys know the lyrics. You guys start. You start. You guys do it first.

50
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:53,399
Here we go at the same time. Ready? Hey, I know you're new.

51
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,199
Welcome to the stream. Pull up a chair. It's quite the dream.

52
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,560
It's your first time here. Oh, what a joy.

53
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,379
But don't act like the stream is a toy. You.

54
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:24,500
All right, fuck that. Let's go. No signal.

55
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,180
Okay, you know what's really funny? Can I go off? I'm going to go off right now.

56
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,459
Do you know how exhausting it would probably be for every new follower or

57
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:40,100
every new subscriber if I had to sing that fucking song?

58
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,459
I would look over and they would be a new sub or something. I'd be like,

59
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:48,970
oh wait, there's this 10 new subs. Hey, welcome to the stream.

60
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:55,029
It's just you and I. So he's gone. No, he didn't leave.

61
00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:00,939
He actually left. No, he didn't. He's here. You're going to get a personal

62
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:07,800
song sung about you and leave? No, I didn't. He didn't leave.

63
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,240
That was a personal directed like welcome song.

64
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,529
Actually, that's kind of weird. I probably would fucking leave too.

65
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,759
I'd probably leave if I came into a stream and I was like, hey,

66
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,839
my first time here and it was like, hey, Germa, welcome to my new stream.

67
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,639
You're a new guy. Everybody sing on the side.

68
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,079
It'd be like, I'm fucking out of here, man.

69
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:29,240
I just want to relax and just watch TV and eat like french fries.

70
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,230
Like, fuck you. Like, stop talking to me.

71
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:42,389
I just want to watch the stream, man. I've so overdone it to this person

72
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,110
at this point that now I like they probably I would get back.

73
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:51,339
This is the most overdone new viewer experience.

74
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:59,160
Okay, let's go. It's time for psychic detectives.

75
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,639
I have two different drinks here. Does that make me a psycho?

76
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:15,779
Does that make me a weird person? Yes. Movie. Wait, what do you mean movie?

77
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:32,810
Why does it say movie? Is this a movie? No, this is a video game, man.

78
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:45,449
Electronic arts and colossal pictures. It's a fucking nightmare.

79
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,029
Psychic powers. The world is yours to control.

80
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:58,019
That's a load of crap. What the hell is going on?

81
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,000
I need to turn the...

82
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,250
If I could predict the future, there'd be a few less dead bodies.

83
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,610
We just got a shot. I need to turn the volume up.

84
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,339
There I was, doing what I do best.

85
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,579
Look at that hair. That's my hair.

86
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:29,819
The old freak of nature routine. Called myself the psychic flash.

87
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,580
Hey, the old folks loved it. Me, I got that.

88
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,659
He's so close. Why are you this close to the audience?

89
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,700
Your grandfather gave this to you on his deathbed.

90
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,059
It's the Joker. It's just the Joker.

91
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,159
He's acting like the Joker, too. He's just sitting there staring at me.

92
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:06,360
With one shove, she sent my whole spinning out of control.

93
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,320
She showed me how to transmit my psychic self into the consciousness of others.

94
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,440
To see through their eyes, hear through their ears.

95
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,840
The real mind pirate stuff.

96
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,340
What?

97
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,639
Naturally, there was a price.

98
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:24,120
What's with the cat?

99
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,879
My father just killed himself.

100
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,679
Is he psych... What?

101
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,320
Is he psychically detecting the cat?

102
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:38,200
He showed me to a family gathering maze and ear.

103
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,360
This guy looks like every family feud host.

104
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,379
Lady, this is only $400. What the fuck is this?

105
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:00,730
Another special lesson.

106
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,649
All right, deal.

107
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,039
Ugh. Ugh.

108
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,980
What's Black Diamond? Some missing necklace?

109
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:18,649
Just a game. A silly old Russian game.

110
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,539
His outfit. He's like a fucking circus ringleader.

111
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,460
That's where my father jumped from.

112
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,980
What? Why are we here?

113
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,379
I tell you, Eric. My father was beaten, disgraced.

114
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,019
Too stubborn to give up like that.

115
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,690
Wait, we're going in?

116
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,590
Where are we?

117
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm Eric.

118
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,879
That's my sister Monica.

119
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,080
Where are we?

120
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,000
Very cute. Very weak and gullible.

121
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,759
Who's the plastic dress?

122
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,200
Wait, what do I have to touch?

123
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,000
I have to like touch...

124
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,480
Maybe you can find out for me.

125
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,960
Okay, so...

126
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,460
And him?

127
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,899
I don't know. My father had a many...

128
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:11,620
Why do I feel like we're at like dinner for schmucks right now?

129
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,659
Am I one of the schmucks?

130
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,179
If there's money to be made, he smells it.

131
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:20,470
Keep an eye on him and Monica.

132
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,190
Where will you be?

133
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,309
What?

134
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:25,139
Me? You don't have to worry about me.

135
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,220
Okay, we've got people to talk to?

136
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,169
All right, come on.

137
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:31,850
Are you a friend of Garelia?

138
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,889
No, I want to talk to...

139
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:33,850
We're going to Moki.

140
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:43,830
I just... I totally just told her I gotta fuck off.

141
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,330
Uh-oh.

142
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,419
This is the scariest lady ever.

143
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:48,059
What was that?

144
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,049
Why are we in this scary house?

145
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:05,309
Okay, we'll...

146
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:13,950
Oh, we're inside of his head.

147
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,110
We're inside of Moki's head.

148
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:33,409
Brass ring.

149
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:38,299
Okay, we're looking for a brass ring.

150
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,100
Should I just stay in...

151
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,179
Okay, what if I stay in this guy forever?

152
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,360
Isn't that sweet?

153
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,480
You put it in the shredder, man.

154
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,840
You don't have to just rip it up in three pieces.

155
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,429
Who... What are we looking for?

156
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,340
Why are we in this guy's head?

157
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
We're just sitting there watching a movie.

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,360
Yeah, that's us down there, right?

159
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,240
You think you'd puke if you saw yourself walking down the stairs

160
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,840
and looked over at yourself, looking at yourself?

161
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,440
I would fucking puke right now.

162
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,669
Monica.

163
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:19,710
You should talk to Max.

164
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,460
Max sent me a check and the authority to give you

165
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,620
whatever kind of advance you'd like.

166
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,019
Oh, okay.

167
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:33,519
The donation of the Vladimir Pozzak collection to Mirage Quest.

168
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,769
Oh, back to Moki.

169
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,289
No, I don't have an option.

170
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,409
I have to be like within laser eye distance of them.

171
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:42,700
Oh, in my head.

172
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,360
Wait, this is what I see.

173
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,679
Cigar.

174
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,100
What am I...

175
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,539
I'm smoking somebody's cigar?

176
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:03,629
I must ask you to go.

177
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,190
Your uncle was a big noise.

178
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,789
A real player in the old country.

179
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,240
Paranormal espionage.

180
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,039
Did I just get kicked out?

181
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,159
That's all I'm allowed to say.

182
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,919
But perhaps you would be interested in a little collectible.

183
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:16,720
Oh, that's what I need.

184
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,519
I want that watch.

185
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,200
He's shameless.

186
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,879
His hands.

187
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,080
He's got like three hands.

188
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,409
Chad.

189
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,169
Oh, what's Chad up to?

190
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:33,529
Oh, wait.

191
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:34,169
This is the money.

192
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,539
Chad's got the money.

193
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,899
Are we Chad?

194
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:38,299
I don't know.

195
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:38,940
I don't understand.

196
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,649
What is all this shit?

197
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:49,929
This is like an incantation?

198
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:50,649
Hi there.

199
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,029
What is going on in this house?

200
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:56,669
What'd you find?

201
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,029
This is the most fucked up house ever.

202
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,549
Just a little notebook.

203
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:02,159
This is just improv class the house.

204
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,669
Okay, you got to walk into a room.

205
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:06,110
And now give me an object.

206
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,750
The book.

207
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,070
Okay.

208
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:16,970
And then she we're back in Eric's head.

209
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,830
Big knife.

210
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:24,879
We don't know that.

211
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,960
No, you have your chance.

212
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,639
I don't have any idea what the fuck is going on.

213
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,240
How do we make you sing?

214
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,740
Jesus.

215
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:38,960
Wait, wait.

216
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,840
A knife.

217
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,340
Knife.

218
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,440
Pick up the knife.

219
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,799
I had one second to look at that.

220
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,799
Take a genius to play it out.

221
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,080
I was coming down.

222
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,360
She was going up.

223
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
The door prize was a hunk of blood pudding.

224
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,440
I didn't I'll go away.

225
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,320
I didn't touch anything.

226
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,820
What happened?

227
00:15:58,539 --> 00:15:59,580
Chad sort of made a mess.

228
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:01,019
Chad made a mess.

229
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,440
Are we leaving?

230
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,679
Please insert disc two.

231
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,620
Okay, let's go ahead.

232
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,820
I'm going to put in disc.

233
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,259
That was a quick.

234
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,299
That was very fast.

235
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,220
So what have we gathered so far?

236
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,279
Hold on.

237
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,559
40 minutes or so.

238
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,440
Where the fuck are they?

239
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,120
Where are these discs?

240
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
All right.

241
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,440
What have we gathered?

242
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:34,590
So far we've gathered that

243
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,870
there's a guy.

244
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,389
Somebody jumped out of a window.

245
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,509
And then we all went to a dinner party at their house

246
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,429
to find out who did it or something.

247
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:49,690
And then somebody gets stabbed.

248
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,730
There's a ring.

249
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,450
There's a watch.

250
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:53,929
You know what?

251
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:54,970
I have no idea.

252
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,529
So just I'm going to put disc two in.

253
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:00,480
We're going to see what happens.

254
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
I don't think can I even get into disc two?

255
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,279
There we go.

256
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,559
I don't have to press a button.

257
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,839
The game has.

258
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,160
Yeah.

259
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,839
I don't understand what you went through.

260
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,559
All the FMVs that are available in one disc.

261
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,829
That seems a little ridiculous.

262
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,710
12 video files on each disc.

263
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,480
All right.

264
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,519
Let's continue the story.

265
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,420
A meaty 3DO game.

266
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:25,740
Yeah.

267
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,940
Or like this is AI dungeon.

268
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,900
Shot for shot.

269
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,779
What happens next?

270
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,289
Crops got involved.

271
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:49,369
From the puka lounge to multiple stab wound city.

272
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,210
Courtesy of my libido.

273
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,609
I made a mental note.

274
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:56,730
From now on only do you brunch with these people.

275
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,299
You sure it was her?

276
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,180
Yeah.

277
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,859
Like I had a front row seat.

278
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:03,819
But why Chad?

279
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,160
Your father keep a green notebook?

280
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:07,950
Yeah.

281
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,710
Any idea what was in it?

282
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,630
Not really.

283
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,910
Don't play with me, Lena.

284
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,470
I don't know.

285
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,359
His big secret.

286
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,200
I feel like I skipped to the middle of the movie.

287
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,700
I think Chad was going to sell it to the weasel.

288
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,980
The Sylvia chick had other ideas.

289
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,900
Did we accidentally do the right outcome?

290
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,059
Eric, you're better than I could have hoped for.

291
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:29,710
Okay, here we go.

292
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,509
So are we good night?

293
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,269
Give me those keys.

294
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:40,000
I just wanted to take the keys, man.

295
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,759
I just wanted to take the keys.

296
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:48,079
Hiding somebody.

297
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,000
Shut up.

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Who is he?

299
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,549
Sergey.

300
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,839
And Sergey is.

301
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:00,509
Not my lover.

302
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,549
Not my plaything.

303
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,400
Just a poor defenseless man.

304
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,700
Did I lose?

305
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,660
Did I touch the keys?

306
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,920
Poor defenseless man.

307
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,119
So how-

308
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,319
All right, we're gonna follow her.

309
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,049
I have trouble doing exactly what I'm told.

310
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,490
And I hate being lied to.

311
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,690
Okay, she was going to bite my head off.

312
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,490
Now what?

313
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,849
But that's better than getting it blown.

314
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:36,650
I'm really close.

315
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,410
Did you notice I'm just following her?

316
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,289
Did she not look?

317
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:40,410
She doesn't know I'm behind her.

318
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,410
She has no idea that I followed her.

319
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:49,400
Okay, that was way easier than it even seems to be in like GTA.

320
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,839
Knock on the door.

321
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,220
Don't look so surprised.

322
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,470
I mean, I followed you all the fucking way here.

323
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:07,819
Are you satisfied?

324
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,299
Did you find all the dirty truth you have?

325
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:10,859
That puppet.

326
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,940
Let's touch the puppet and see what happened.

327
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:22,009
Kiki dance.

328
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:23,289
Kiki dance.

329
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,170
Who did this to him?

330
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,049
What?

331
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,880
Well, who do you think?

332
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,519
The great Vladimir.

333
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,480
How could he?

334
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,849
Oh, he was so pleased with himself.

335
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:37,049
Such an elegant solution to such a messy situation.

336
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,130
The two of you-

337
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,009
What did she say?

338
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,130
Vladimir?

339
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:41,769
Oh, please.

340
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:44,809
Wait, I can go with somebody.

341
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:45,529
Let's go in her head.

342
00:20:46,329 --> 00:21:03,640
Why is that so funny?

343
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,559
I guess you have gerbils that are running on a wheel.

344
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,079
I guess it's hilarious.

345
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:17,390
What the hell is going on?

346
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,470
Can't we help him?

347
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,029
Is he dead?

348
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,190
Did I just like psychic him to death?

349
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,910
Isn't that the thing that they keep the bingo balls in?

350
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,869
We need all four.

351
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,299
And you think I can find the other three?

352
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:46,730
I just hope you're ready.

353
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,049
I need to find four of these magic cylinders.

354
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,000
At least we have the actual thing we need to do for the game.

355
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,529
Don't do it.

356
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:06,009
Wait, it's-

357
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:13,559
Okay, that's-

358
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,480
That's-

359
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,279
It's improv.

360
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:16,839
It's improv.

361
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,880
It's improv.

362
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:19,559
It's improv.

363
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,279
It wasn't anything.

364
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,279
Oh, shit.

365
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:22,759
Where do I go?

366
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:26,250
Oh, in Max's head.

367
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,970
There's a little hot shot inside my head.

368
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,250
Eric Fox.

369
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,690
That name means nothing to me.

370
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,890
He's leaving fingerprints all over my mind.

371
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,089
I just changed the channel.

372
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:36,730
How can you tell?

373
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,049
You'd never understand.

374
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:39,549
Hey!

375
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,009
I'm not all tricked out and psychic,

376
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:44,089
but I'm damn good at what I do.

377
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:45,049
Smoked you out.

378
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,609
Maximum sub bonabim.

379
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,049
What about Eric?

380
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:53,339
I'm going to squash you like a sow bug.

381
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,910
What happened?

382
00:22:58,029 --> 00:22:58,910
Aggression.

383
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,630
You just spat me out.

384
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,400
You can use it.

385
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
You can read me.

386
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,200
You can read all of us.

387
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
You can go anywhere.

388
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,319
Oh, you little innocent boy.

389
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,279
It was mine.

390
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,559
He gave it to me.

391
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,319
Are those stink lines?

392
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,759
Is she like smelling my body?

393
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:22,269
You did that.

394
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:22,589
Wait.

395
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:24,910
A dad just made her be aggressive.

396
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:31,599
But I think maybe you deserve it.

397
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,099
What?

398
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,180
There is a chance to spy, to go anywhere.

399
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,859
Read Psych-lana.

400
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:44,940
Wait.

401
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,660
Did I just?

402
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:45,980
Did I?

403
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:51,869
This guy.

404
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,839
Who the fuck is this?

405
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,180
He's not even here anymore.

406
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:05,920
Did that even happen?

407
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,119
You're under arrest for the murder of Sergian Olsenko and Chad Zatowski.

408
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,440
You have the right to remain silent.

409
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,359
You have the right to an attorney.

410
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,480
Anything you say can.

411
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,160
How many times are they going to put cuffs on me?

412
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,640
That was like five different cuffs.

413
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,609
So you like to read me?

414
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:28,730
What were you doing in the house?

415
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,609
Did you get the knife?

416
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:30,890
Like to cough turkey?

417
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,210
Sure.

418
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,009
Every Christmas.

419
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,690
You did a real number on Chad.

420
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,049
Not much darker meat was it?

421
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:35,849
I know who did it.

422
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:38,569
It was that chick who runs the tea room, Sylvia.

423
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,609
She killed him over a notebook.

424
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:42,650
Can you believe that?

425
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,289
You saw her?

426
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:44,809
These guys are touching.

427
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:46,970
How small is this room?

428
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,250
Is this an airplane bathroom?

429
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,450
He was nailed.

430
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,970
He was a fall guy.

431
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,559
He was going to jail.

432
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,359
Oh my god.

433
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,680
I guess we're going on to...

434
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,200
There is no losing.

435
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,559
We're moving on to the final chapter of the game.

436
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,150
This is like a roguelike.

437
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,029
I could just do it again.

438
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,559
Let me get this right.

439
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,720
So we didn't catch the killer.

440
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,089
That's what you have to do.

441
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:29,289
We caught it the first time.

442
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:35,500
But when that guy walked in with like two bleeding breasts,

443
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,029
we have no idea what happened to him.

444
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:39,309
And the guy had a gun.

445
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:41,079
We didn't catch it.

446
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,190
Well, let's see what happens.

447
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:56,480
You know, I'm going to keep these discs at the ready.

448
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,339
They need to be available.

449
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:05,819
Main character looks unreasonably sweaty.

450
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:09,039
I mean, yeah.

451
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,720
All right, we're in jail.

452
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,680
It's like I'm standing still.

453
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,880
Shit, I missed enough.

454
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,720
I could have gone in that guy's head.

455
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,160
Too weird to lie.

456
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:32,779
Detective, could you take that outside?

457
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:35,180
Detective, can you please not like light your nose on fire?

458
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,349
Why are you holding a lighter up to your eyebrows?

459
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,710
That's kind of strange.

460
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:48,349
We're going to go courier.

461
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,079
Holy shit, dude.

462
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:05,930
He drove like a type A wired on coffee and stressed to the max.

463
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,650
Come on.

464
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,049
Come on.

465
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:07,690
Come on.

466
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,089
Huh?

467
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:09,210
Jesus.

468
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,250
Yak, yak, yak.

469
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:13,609
He cursed the world, cut off everybody,

470
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:16,250
and had this false chipper voice for customers.

471
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:16,890
All righty.

472
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,329
Just sign right there on the Dipsy Doodle.

473
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:21,369
All of us are working.

474
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:23,130
Can we do the speed limit, please?

475
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,769
Excuse me.

476
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:25,450
Hello.

477
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,250
You're bigger than me.

478
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:26,730
Not much.

479
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,529
You're bigger than me.

480
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,890
A deeply disturbed head.

481
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,609
We all do this.

482
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:31,049
The psychic detectives can't be choosers.

483
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:31,529
I do this.

484
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:35,640
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, please.

485
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,839
Not that, but I do the sounds.

486
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,799
Those noises, I do.

487
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,500
All right, what's in the package?

488
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:47,690
So nice.

489
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,130
He's got all the...

490
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,170
All right, we're going to Bagman.

491
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,519
Courier's walking by.

492
00:27:53,519 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm Bagman now.

493
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,480
I just...

494
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,680
Get a life, dirtbag.

495
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:08,490
Wait, I can just jump into his head to laugh at him?

496
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:10,809
The rest became a blur.

497
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:13,450
What was the point of being able to jump into him?

498
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,490
Green light, green light.

499
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,609
He whistled at women and ate bags of pork rinds.

500
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:19,609
I couldn't stand it much longer.

501
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:21,289
Even jail was sounding better than...

502
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,500
Hey, somebody likes your hot shots.

503
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,539
He just pulled me out of that.

504
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,559
Sorry we kept you, kid.

505
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,519
Why is he in jail with me?

506
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:37,710
Oh, why is everybody in...

507
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,230
Why is she in prison?

508
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,539
Even the receptionist was in prison.

509
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:51,740
I think we should see how the old woman is doing.

510
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,779
What do you think?

511
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:54,380
I think we forget about her.

512
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,680
Who the kid?

513
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,880
Papa Vladimir?

514
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,160
He hid the fourth collector.

515
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,599
Am I going to have to put up on disc three?

516
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,279
How could you?

517
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:08,779
Eric, you are a genius.

518
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:10,140
I know.

519
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,990
Okay, here's where the...

520
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,869
Oh, there's Bagman.

521
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,009
Is it active?

522
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:16,650
Can you tell?

523
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,490
Barely.

524
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,480
But no tricks.

525
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,279
Just get it for me.

526
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,799
Can't go into Bagman again.

527
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,440
That's unfair.

528
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,200
Holy shit.

529
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,400
Okay.

530
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,599
But you're a fine looking couple.

531
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,400
You know, I tell you,

532
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,119
I get some butt ugly people in here sometimes.

533
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,480
It's a pleasure just to look at you.

534
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,759
Let me just look at you.

535
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,599
Can I see that metal crystal beer mug?

536
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,880
Oh, we get...

537
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,240
You can have it.

538
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Some old bitch brought it in, I tell you.

539
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,160
You guys are a lot more fun than she was.

540
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,799
Two out of four.

541
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,680
Have a nice day.

542
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,319
Who's that easy?

543
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,039
Have a nice day.

544
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,339
Why would you say that?

545
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,460
Hey, do you want to get to hold it?

546
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:15,420
Can I hold it?

547
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,980
We don't need...

548
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,099
It's not like a dog

549
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,859
that you just got out of the pet store.

550
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,579
We can do this.

551
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:19,980
No, come on.

552
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,460
Let me hold him.

553
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:33,519
Okay, good.

554
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,079
Now we got...

555
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,480
Find them.

556
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,599
Tell me what they're doing.

557
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,160
Madame T.

558
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,880
Idiot.

559
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,539
You take too long.

560
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,630
Have your only hope.

561
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,710
She's talking to herself

562
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,910
but she know we're in her head.

563
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,950
What did you learn?

564
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,900
With your lady's steam.

565
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,099
What old lady?

566
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,779
Old lady's a pain in the key store.

567
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,519
Fine.

568
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,440
We'll give her the precious student.

569
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,799
Okay, so we're gonna go see the old lady.

570
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,029
Wait.

571
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,619
There's something I want to try.

572
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,039
We only need two more of these.

573
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,799
What are you trying?

574
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,279
Papa.

575
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:13,069
Triangles.

576
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,700
What is going...

577
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,259
What's he doing?

578
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,279
It was Max.

579
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,000
He was here.

580
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,640
Walk pattern.

581
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,559
It was Bugleberry.

582
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,920
It was Bugleberry

583
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,720
laughing at somebody

584
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,240
how bad they hated the new carpet

585
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,039
that just got delivered.

586
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,269
What the fuck am I doing?

587
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:53,609
It was already open.

588
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:55,049
It was clearly already open.

589
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,000
Case.

590
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:11,880
Okay.

591
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,359
Shards.

592
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,799
Workbench.

593
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,319
Let's get the pin.

594
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:24,750
Okay.

595
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,190
What's with the flashing lights by the way?

596
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,190
Where are we?

597
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:30,299
Shards.

598
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:36,559
Wait, he just broke one.

599
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,319
One of the spirits?

600
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,869
Or was it open...

601
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:46,430
Workbench.

602
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:04,119
Okay.

603
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:04,440
No.

604
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,640
Go to Madame T.

605
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,839
We go to Madame T?

606
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,450
Lexi killed your dad.

607
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,200
Lexi?

608
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,160
Lexi, Max.

609
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,279
Same asshole.

610
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,430
How do you know?

611
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,029
Why do you think I touched him?

612
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:25,150
To sniff my fingers?

613
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,750
What a weird thing to go to first.

614
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,470
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:31,309
He was here.

616
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,670
He wanted the fourth collector.

617
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,319
And he torched the hell out of Vladimir.

618
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:40,349
Uh-oh.

619
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:40,910
Madame T.

620
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:44,000
We're too late.

621
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,640
Just for me, Eric.

622
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,559
Make her...

623
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,720
...wist.

624
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,220
No.

625
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,960
Hello on the old lady's face.

626
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,390
Oh.

627
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,670
Find what you can.

628
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,309
Find what I can.

629
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:10,590
Rip her to pieces.

630
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:15,239
Feed her or fry her.

631
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,719
You think you can use me?

632
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,719
Bend me?

633
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:21,719
For practice?

634
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,170
Get out!

635
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:24,889
Oh shit.

636
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:25,369
We blew it.

637
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,949
Get out before I take a turn.

638
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,989
You tell your next mirage.

639
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,110
We are ready.

640
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,789
Didn't she kill the person?

641
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,989
Anybody tried to talk to Moki lately?

642
00:34:57,789 --> 00:34:58,590
What is Moki?

643
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,090
Uh-oh.

644
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:01,389
Uh-oh.

645
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,679
What is this game board?

646
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:20,809
Did we just get three?

647
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,489
We got a third one?

648
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:29,980
What in the name?

649
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:34,139
This is no game of checkers and pieces.

650
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,099
You must pick thoughts, Eric.

651
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:37,599
Go on.

652
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:39,420
This kind of...

653
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,619
The guy kind of looks like my dad.

654
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:41,500
So I'm just gonna pick him.

655
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,360
How about the skull?

656
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,659
Cigarette.

657
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,099
A shoe.

658
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:00,460
Yes, always pick the shoe.

659
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,019
Vladimir, he loved the shoe.

660
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,239
Always the shoe.

661
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,519
How about...

662
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,400
And you?

663
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:15,769
As long as I am alive.

664
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:16,269
Cool.

665
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,960
She's playing her pieces now.

666
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,550
Is this like auto chess?

667
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,190
Are they gonna fight?

668
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,469
I don't understand this.

669
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:24,670
You move first.

670
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,989
That is what this is.

671
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,949
I attack the shoe.

672
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,010
I'm gonna use the shoe to attack this person.

673
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,760
Got it.

674
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,639
They are the same.

675
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,679
Nobody wins till the next move.

676
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,119
Too bad for you.

677
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,070
It's my turn.

678
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,869
Okay.

679
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:48,110
So you're gonna go with lady versus dad.

680
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,909
You kill dad.

681
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:49,949
We take turns.

682
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,599
One of us will lose everything.

683
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:53,880
You understand?

684
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,599
Kill him.

685
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,159
Brat bastard, to be my laptop.

686
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,119
So what?

687
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,000
Own the fear.

688
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,800
Find the scar.

689
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,760
Free the girl.

690
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,880
Steal the kiss.

691
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
You're a little cocky.

692
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,820
I think.

693
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,320
Hi, noon babe.

694
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,039
Big showdown.

695
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,760
Eric, I don't think you realize.

696
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,480
What?

697
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,139
That I could walk away a fritter?

698
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,659
That I'm insane to do this?

699
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:18,539
What don't I realize?

700
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,019
Andy Samberg and original Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill got fused together.

701
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:24,059
Light a fire.

702
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:31,070
That really got me rocking.

703
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:37,019
I still have no idea what's going on.

704
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,539
So we now have to do her bidding.

705
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:42,219
Join the war on depression.

706
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,179
That's okay.

707
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,269
I mean, yeah, but that was back to disc one.

708
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:52,429
Holy shit.

709
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,269
We go backwards?

710
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:01,230
Let's make sure this is disc one.

711
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,099
I got it.

712
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:04,219
We're in a loop.

713
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,179
I don't think it's a loop.

714
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:14,639
I think they just compiled all the video files alphabetically on each disc.

715
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:34,940
Here we go.

716
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,440
Movie.

717
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:52,809
Is this the guy from Command and Conquer?

718
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:56,090
Wait, why'd she just fall down?

719
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:14,760
Wouldn't she just standing right next to him?

720
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,800
Would she do that?

721
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,440
She went and found a painting of him.

722
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:23,659
Why'd she just punch him in the face?

723
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:44,090
I don't even know.

724
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,369
I left her alone.

725
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:46,969
I have no fucking idea.

726
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:49,280
I left her for him.

727
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:52,969
I saw like a Mazel Tov thing and then...

728
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,250
What's he doing?

729
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:56,489
Let's take him out.

730
00:39:56,489 --> 00:39:57,050
I want to go.

731
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,010
What do you mean take him out?

732
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,650
Then go.

733
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,610
But I'm holding this.

734
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:03,760
Maximum me.

735
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,559
Maximum you.

736
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,880
Is that like a self-help guru?

737
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:14,190
We're just walking into this guy's...

738
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,110
He's crossed-armed waiting for us.

739
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:39,340
This is the kind of reaction you have and the noises you make when you first pull up

740
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,860
photo booth for the iPad.

741
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:46,780
It's true.

742
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,500
Everybody played their part perfectly.

743
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,650
This is how you do it.

744
00:40:57,449 --> 00:40:59,210
No wasted motion.

745
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,690
No parlor tricks.

746
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,130
Say goodbye to the girl.

747
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:04,730
Go to the car.

748
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,880
Harder.

749
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:10,829
Don't you want to see her cry?

750
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:11,070
No.

751
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:12,829
You think I need your help?

752
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:13,710
Oh wait.

753
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,510
You think I want you watching me?

754
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,710
He's psychic detecting me.

755
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,150
You're a cheerleader, a throw-ruck.

756
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:18,429
Now move!

757
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,059
Go!

758
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:20,699
Damn it.

759
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:24,000
Good boy.

760
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,360
Daddy's good boy.

761
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,000
Nobody wants to burn you.

762
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,639
Just bring me the toy.

763
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:36,039
These are the good times.

764
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:36,679
Bad ending.

765
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:40,650
The old man knew I was the best.

766
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,329
There was never any question about that.

767
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,090
The question was how to keep me happy.

768
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,769
You can't turn referee into a trendy style.

769
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:50,570
I'm sorry.

770
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,010
That fucking best don't work.

771
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,289
I made him look brilliant.

772
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:57,039
Surrendered Jim Chujinka.

773
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:58,940
Miss Layla.

774
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,659
But she is so stubborn.

775
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:07,659
And I get so pissed off.

776
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:13,210
Oh not this again.

777
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,010
Okay.

778
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:20,250
Cigarette versus, I don't know, a metronome and Bill Murray.

779
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:22,650
Versus, and the toy.

780
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:27,960
There's no shoe.

781
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,559
Oh wait, he had a shoe already.

782
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,360
Your move.

783
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,719
Try to be interesting.

784
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,920
Okay, we're gonna go cigarette.

785
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:40,000
No, we're gonna go toy onto shoe.

786
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,849
It's my game now.

787
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:46,010
The old man can rot.

788
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:48,170
I make the rules.

789
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,369
It means whatever I want it to mean.

790
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:58,429
Okay, we're gonna go, uh.

791
00:42:58,429 --> 00:42:59,630
You're a butcher.

792
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,670
I'm a surgeon.

793
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:06,030
Lancing and popping all the little pimples that stain my natural glory.

794
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,489
So this has been just a psychic fight between the two of us the whole time.

795
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:16,110
A lot of real estate for a lucky man.

796
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,829
Sorry, I still have the, I still have the metronome.

797
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,980
It blocked.

798
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,019
Why'd she do it, Max?

799
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:24,219
I don't know.

800
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,900
She gave up.

801
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,380
She couldn't stand to see you become such a monster.

802
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,590
Okay, this is important.

803
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,989
Metronome versus shoe?

804
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:40,400
Or metronome versus lady?

805
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:40,880
I don't know.

806
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:45,920
Shoe.

807
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,559
Fuck, they canceled each other out.

808
00:43:48,559 --> 00:44:02,030
Canceling each other out like smothering a silent stream.

809
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:06,159
War, you are so handsome.

810
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:09,719
So full of blood.

811
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,480
Of the balls.

812
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,119
I'm not even playing cards.

813
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:14,840
Double war.

814
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:18,619
If only I could die.

815
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:21,079
I win.

816
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:21,559
I win.

817
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:22,840
Kiki, I win.

818
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:24,059
Kiki!

819
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:25,659
Kiki!

820
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:32,320
Okay, so that's a bad ending.

821
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,840
Moki's playmate.

822
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,559
The village idiot.

823
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:38,360
This little piggy.

824
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,079
Maximum eric.

825
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,199
Double war.

826
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:41,400
Pooka lounge blues.

827
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,440
Lexi's last laugh.

828
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,159
Change heads.

829
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,260
No third chances.

830
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:45,980
Pretty bracelet.

831
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,019
The healing hothead.

832
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:47,900
The big kiss.

833
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,780
And the grand slam.

834
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,179
If you turn the menu over,

835
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:55,039
you'll see our list of our beverages.

836
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:56,480
And some alcohol.

837
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,920
You can order as well.

838
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,809
Start it a little bit.

839
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:03,690
Buck that one up a little.

840
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,090
It's okay.

841
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:05,659
Come on!

842
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:09,210
Give me that one.

843
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:17,760
Did you play black diamond with madam?

844
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:19,679
Tikonov?

845
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,420
Did I?

846
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:28,860
Belvages.

847
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,139
Yeah, yeah, belvages.

848
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:32,969
And now what?

849
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:34,619
Is that it?

850
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,039
Do we do it again?

851
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:37,840
All right.

852
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,440
Now that I know what's going on,

853
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,920
I want to try to do it again.

854
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,519
Now that I know what's happening,

855
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:47,159
I want to try.

856
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:48,360
I want to do it one more time.

857
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:48,920
Do you?

858
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:56,280
No, but yes.

859
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,119
We have to try a separate outcome.

860
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:08,320
Here we go.

861
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,489
We get invited to the dinner party.

862
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,420
That's my sister, Monica.

863
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,219
Okay, Monica.

864
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,380
He was hoping to come in first.

865
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,420
I can't believe it.

866
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,500
Your sister doesn't waste much time.

867
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,539
We have to get into Sylvia's head

868
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:25,659
because we're going to watch her kill the guy.

869
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,659
Meet him at the tea room at 10 o'clock.

870
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:32,539
I can change channels.

871
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,300
This is just in real time.

872
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,769
I miss the good times.

873
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:39,530
Monica, focus.

874
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,369
Max wants to make you an offer.

875
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:42,250
To me?

876
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,929
Mirage Quest would like to handle

877
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:45,369
your father's collection.

878
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,570
Which one?

879
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,849
Tea room, 10 o'clock, yep.

880
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:50,010
Max, Mirage will personally help you.

881
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,889
I could accept no less than 200.

882
00:46:52,889 --> 00:46:55,210
Have you no shame, idiot?

883
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,800
It's just a giant twister spinner.

884
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,679
It's not ready for twister, you bastard.

885
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,320
We do that after our dessert drinks.

886
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:15,920
Okay, here we go.

887
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,849
Play Black Diamond with her.

888
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:28,750
All right, Black Diamond.

889
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:31,550
Felt like a good time to get acquainted with dad.

890
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,230
What worked in the Pooka Room

891
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,750
was bound to work around here.

892
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:40,349
The house had seen better days.

893
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:42,909
Better days, worse days.

894
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:44,989
It was just starting to give a big wet kiss

895
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:46,429
to the rotten days.

896
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:48,909
And there was stuff all around keeping secrets.

897
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:50,429
I wanted to find more.

898
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:50,929
Window.

899
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:59,519
He threw him out the window.

900
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:03,289
Yep.

901
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:04,809
I must ask you to go.

902
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,289
Your uncle was a big noise.

903
00:48:07,369 --> 00:48:08,969
A real player in the old country.

904
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,449
Paranormal espionage.

905
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:12,650
We have to go to Chad.

906
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,849
But perhaps you would be interested

907
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:16,889
in a little collectible.

908
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,250
Chadster, shame on you.

909
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:20,889
This is Chad.

910
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,159
All right, stay with Chad.

911
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,289
She comes in and she stabs him.

912
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,590
Save him.

913
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,389
Can I?

914
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:45,820
But not to touch.

915
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,539
Oh, shit.

916
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:47,659
I just jumped onto the game board.

917
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:48,619
We're not going to see Chad die.

918
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,750
You are bold, disobedient.

919
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,869
That is good.

920
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:05,389
You will need to be reckless.

921
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:06,909
This is a Christopher Walken character.

922
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:14,280
He was lexing me up in hell for all I care.

923
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,019
What'd he do?

924
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,630
He was Vladimir's most brilliant pupil.

925
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,989
It's like SNL skit.

926
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:25,389
We first to learn how to destroy the black diamond.

927
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:26,750
Oh, she's going to teach me how to play.

928
00:49:27,389 --> 00:49:29,309
Bash the hell out of a kitty cat?

929
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:30,349
Real brilliant.

930
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:37,119
Child is a symbol of the real power.

931
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:39,900
Time is right.

932
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:45,769
Oh, she could sense the murder.

933
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:46,650
Who is in the study?

934
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,010
Sleazy Chad.

935
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:50,010
Quickly, go to him.

936
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:59,869
What are you doing?

937
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:00,590
Get, should I get out?

938
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,280
Give me the inkblot.

939
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:09,050
Why do we call him Sleazy Chad?

940
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,409
Can't we just call him Chad?

941
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:19,070
She was hitting decibels dangerous to psychics and dogs.

942
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:22,190
Seemed like a good time to find my lovely escort.

943
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,369
What the hell is going on?

944
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:32,969
Dead body, lots of blood.

945
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:34,170
Your sister thinks I did it.

946
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,769
Decibels does not equal frequency.

947
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:36,730
Give me a break.

948
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:37,449
Come on, let's go.

949
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:39,849
Yeah, so?

950
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:41,369
All right, here we go.

951
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:44,730
We're on the right track.

952
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,730
This time, I'm going to stay as Bagman.

953
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,650
I'm not going to change from Bagman this time.

954
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:58,190
I want to be Bagman for the rest of the playthrough.

955
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,510
No, shit, I think I misplaced the second disc.

956
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:01,949
No, shit, that's Jurassic Park.

957
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:02,750
It looks the exact same.

958
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,650
Where'd it go?

959
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,130
Oh, no.

960
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,099
Disc three, that's disc one.

961
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:09,900
Where's disc two?

962
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:20,119
This is why I fucking hated having multiple discs.

963
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,599
You could always just get to the same part of Final Fantasy VII

964
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:24,280
before you had to stop.

965
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,880
Right before you met Kat-Sith.

966
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:48,800
We got spoilers.

967
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,920
It's a character in the game.

968
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,880
What are you talking about?

969
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,599
All right, these are both right here.

970
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:54,719
I got them right in front of me.

971
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:00,059
It's not, it's Kate, not Kat.

972
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,800
Kat, write nothing back.

973
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,000
Lousy party.

974
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,719
I sat there knowing two things dead certain.

975
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:10,800
Laynen was going to drag me in deeper

976
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,239
and I was going to follow like some over-sex schnauzer.

977
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:17,679
All right, should I not touch the bracelet this time?

978
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:19,760
Obtahoka, what's that mean?

979
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:22,159
It means stop it.

980
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,159
All right, kiss me sound whacked.

981
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:26,480
Your dad really did jump out the window.

982
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,519
You sound whacked.

983
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,719
Not exactly suicide.

984
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,320
What was it?

985
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,840
I don't know.

986
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,760
As someone was messing with his head.

987
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,760
That's not possible.

988
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,420
What's not?

989
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:39,929
Well, you know.

990
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:42,570
This is some ugly ass seat covers.

991
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,090
I'm still trying to get used to it.

992
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:45,449
Yeah, right.

993
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,690
You sure look busted up about it.

994
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:50,940
So are we good night?

995
00:52:51,579 --> 00:52:52,969
All right.

996
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:53,769
What's Monica?

997
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,050
Just a little more.

998
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:55,769
I'm gonna let her go.

999
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:57,849
I do not trust this mirage quest.

1000
00:52:57,849 --> 00:52:58,809
I'm gonna let her go.

1001
00:52:58,809 --> 00:52:59,449
You're going?

1002
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,230
I have to.

1003
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:02,670
Don't ask why.

1004
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:04,269
Just hate.

1005
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:06,250
I don't like the rules.

1006
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:06,750
What?

1007
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:08,960
Eric.

1008
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,000
Maybe I want to know why.

1009
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,239
People are in danger.

1010
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:13,280
Let's be specific.

1011
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,679
Lexi, Anna, all my cousins, little children.

1012
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:18,719
Just trust me.

1013
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,159
I have to follow Monica.

1014
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:21,119
I might come by later.

1015
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:21,760
Bring the boyfriend.

1016
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,280
Bring the whole box of dirty secrets.

1017
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,320
If there's a knife in my back, throw it in the sink.

1018
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,119
I'll do it in the morning.

1019
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:27,619
What?

1020
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,730
What do you mean if there's a knife in my back?

1021
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,170
I got something in my eye.

1022
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:38,219
Should I follow her?

1023
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,539
I'm gonna try to get a different outcome this time.

1024
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:41,039
All right.

1025
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,480
We're gonna just go inside of her head.

1026
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,550
Something's in my eye.

1027
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,190
It's horrible.

1028
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,469
It's like a knife in my eye.

1029
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:02,579
What?

1030
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:06,980
How are you?

1031
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,440
Mokie found dead.

1032
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,550
You're that psychic kid.

1033
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,349
Flasho.

1034
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,550
Flash in the pan.

1035
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,510
I've seen the act.

1036
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,469
I'm gonna get arrested.

1037
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,670
To my pal, Mokie.

1038
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,949
Listen, you little putz.

1039
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:21,150
You're flying blind.

1040
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,429
You need Mokie.

1041
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,110
Mokie knows the dirt.

1042
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:24,989
I think we need Mokie.

1043
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:27,230
I got it stored in my cheeks.

1044
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,429
That would explain the breath.

1045
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,389
Listen, you do me a little job.

1046
00:54:31,389 --> 00:54:32,829
I clue you in.

1047
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:33,389
Oh, shit.

1048
00:54:33,389 --> 00:54:35,389
You say, Foxy, time's a-

1049
00:54:35,389 --> 00:54:35,789
No, no, no.

1050
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:36,510
We're gonna go with Mokie.

1051
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:38,650
It's maybe a mistake.

1052
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,280
Who is this guy?

1053
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,840
Where do you fit in?

1054
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,440
I ran a little office.

1055
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,440
Code name, Svengali.

1056
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,440
You're a spook?

1057
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,559
I'm a broker.

1058
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:23,000
Lexi wants it effect.

1059
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,039
I bring the dough.

1060
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:26,039
He brings me one of these.

1061
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:27,719
Then what happened?

1062
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:29,400
He grabbed two and flew.

1063
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Too bad his chopper didn't.

1064
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,400
These photos are huge.

1065
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,400
I'm standing in Finland, my juts in my hands.

1066
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,400
And a Svengali.

1067
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,400
So that leaves two collectors.

1068
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,400
He's not only psychic, he can count.

1069
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,440
All right, let's get to work.

1070
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:46,159
Here's the gig.

1071
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,639
You piggyback inside and get to Max Mirage's table.

1072
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,159
Main room, far left corner.

1073
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:52,659
Yep.

1074
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,559
It's not like I use a map.

1075
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,199
Hey, I wouldn't know.

1076
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:58,079
I'm not psychic.

1077
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,679
I don't have the sexy gift.

1078
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:01,840
I just come from a clean straight shot home

1079
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,039
where nobody mess me up.

1080
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,039
What's that supposed to mean?

1081
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:06,159
Exactly what it means.

1082
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:07,360
I know things.

1083
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,440
As usual.

1084
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:09,940
Sexy.

1085
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,019
Okay.

1086
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:14,800
Is there opportunity?

1087
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,320
There's a phone call coming in.

1088
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:16,820
Fake it.

1089
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,320
Two minutes.

1090
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,960
Be there for it.

1091
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,880
And don't screw me.

1092
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,599
It's a phone call.

1093
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,519
Did I, I didn't fake it?

1094
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:28,030
He's still sitting here?

1095
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,519
Psychic bastard, where are you?

1096
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:32,019
Inside?

1097
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:33,929
Have we crossed the room?

1098
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:35,849
Oh, I'm faking being inside.

1099
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:50,440
Kill him.

1100
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,280
Yeah, I'm with you.

1101
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,159
How to play.

1102
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:07,199
Let's hear it.

1103
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:08,400
You put the fear of God in him.

1104
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,119
Why does it go smoke?

1105
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,639
Anyone hear him talking roosties?

1106
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:13,760
Just the whole damn room.

1107
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,760
You're a lying little punk.

1108
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:18,480
Maybe I couldn't get there in time.

1109
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,079
Maybe you're full of crap.

1110
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,840
Why don't you go peep the psychic slot?

1111
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,119
That's about your speed.

1112
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:26,179
What?

1113
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,269
And if you're thinking of taking a ride in my head.

1114
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:38,650
It wouldn't hurt that much.

1115
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,769
That would not even really hurt.

1116
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:43,099
That'd be slightly irritating.

1117
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:44,940
Wait, we just got telltale.

1118
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:47,579
No.

1119
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:49,320
Psychic pizza.

1120
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,679
We know when you're hungry.

1121
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:57,690
Okay, let's get this part right.

1122
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,650
This guy ends up with like three stab wounds in his chest.

1123
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,610
We have to stop it.

1124
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,400
Kiki's the, Kiki's the toy.

1125
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:14,860
Well, who do you think?

1126
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,380
This guy gets murdered.

1127
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:20,250
We have to follow him around.

1128
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,210
He's so pleased with himself.

1129
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:21,769
What's his name?

1130
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:24,969
Such an elegant solution to such a messy situation.

1131
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:27,610
The two of you he didn't approve?

1132
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:29,639
Oh, please.

1133
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,170
I just don't want to explain.

1134
00:58:32,889 --> 00:58:40,599
All right.

1135
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:42,119
Yeah, that's the four device.

1136
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,159
He laughs at the rodents.

1137
00:58:44,119 --> 00:59:05,280
He died.

1138
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,440
Kiki is the doll.

1139
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,239
Can't we help him?

1140
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,480
Okay, here we go.

1141
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:22,059
This is where it all goes to hell.

1142
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,739
Is how I fucked it up last time.

1143
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:26,159
We're going to jump to somebody else here.

1144
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,360
We need all four.

1145
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,780
And you think I can find the other three?

1146
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:35,719
I just hope you're ready.

1147
00:59:37,789 --> 00:59:38,190
Help him.

1148
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:38,670
I'm going to try.

1149
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:42,409
Because last time I didn't go to the old lady.

1150
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:46,440
We came back here and there's a bunch of dead people.

1151
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:06,989
Okay.

1152
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:07,309
All right.

1153
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:07,550
All right.

1154
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:11,519
Max.

1155
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,119
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1156
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,400
Go back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

1157
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,519
No, shit.

1158
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:36,989
We left for two seconds, man.

1159
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,440
I just like in the time it took me to wash my hands in the bathroom.

1160
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:50,909
You're under arrest for murder of Sergei Nosenko and Chatskovsky.

1161
01:00:50,909 --> 01:00:51,789
He died.

1162
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:54,110
You have the right to remain silent.

1163
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:55,150
You have the right to literature.

1164
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:56,030
Can I go back?

1165
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:59,469
Anything you say can and you'll be used against you in a court of law.

1166
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:02,670
I went to the same guy.

1167
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:09,369
Redo.

1168
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:10,409
I think I'm okay.

1169
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:11,050
I think I'm okay.

1170
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:11,690
I think I'm ready.

1171
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,130
How long have you known Chatskovsky?

1172
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:14,570
Why didn't Lena want you at the house?

1173
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,610
You boffing her, kid?

1174
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:16,730
You want to be boffing her?

1175
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,329
What kind of game is she running?

1176
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:20,170
She's looking for a psycho collector.

1177
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:22,969
A whole bunch of people are looking for her.

1178
01:01:22,969 --> 01:01:24,570
Her dad made him four of them.

1179
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:25,690
They're unbelievable.

1180
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:28,329
It's kind of like some crystal hugging hop head.

1181
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:31,849
Guys, I know this is hard to believe.

1182
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:33,530
There was only one way to slip.

1183
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,889
Somebody said cigarettes are cool.

1184
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:35,929
Yeah, I have a cigarette.

1185
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,659
Everybody smokes inside.

1186
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:43,179
Everybody has yellow curtains and yellow stained ceilings.

1187
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:47,610
No wonder.

1188
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:52,090
A realtor is going to come in and say the property value dropped by like

1189
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:54,570
40 grand because the whole house is yellow.

1190
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,969
I smoke in the house.

1191
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:07,920
I think I can still salvage it, though.

1192
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,199
I really think I can.

1193
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:20,800
I can't believe the exact thing.

1194
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,159
Dude fucking died again.

1195
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:23,519
And that guy came in with a gun.

1196
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:25,280
He didn't even shoot anybody, though.

1197
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:34,940
All right, I'm going to get this right.

1198
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:35,340
Here we go.

1199
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,320
Ready and go.

1200
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:41,050
Shit.

1201
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:41,530
No.

1202
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:41,849
Back.

1203
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:00,320
I don't suck.

1204
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:08,800
Why did I click that?

1205
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:10,719
Why did I click that?

1206
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,199
Why did I click that?

1207
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:15,599
I tried to piece the night back together.

1208
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,440
That psychic slushy cup collector had torqued me sideways.

1209
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,920
And something was trying to bubble up.

1210
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,599
I had done this.

1211
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:26,840
No.

1212
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,159
All right.

1213
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:28,679
Let's go somewhere else.

1214
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:29,960
Can I psychic somewhere else?

1215
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:40,909
I never trespassed again until last night.

1216
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:44,559
And like a sick joke, he threw me in the closet.

1217
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:48,969
I think we still get out.

1218
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:53,079
There was squat to do.

1219
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,360
Hard to keep the mind sharp.

1220
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:57,239
I thought about all the women I'd ever slept with.

1221
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:57,880
What?

1222
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,559
All the women I wish I'd slept with.

1223
01:04:00,199 --> 01:04:01,719
All the women who called me shallow.

1224
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:02,679
Is this what you care about?

1225
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:13,150
And then I thought about like, you know, what the plan was going to be.

1226
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,800
Oh, we had a new follower just came in.

1227
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,280
A new viewer.

1228
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:54,889
Welcome him.

1229
01:04:54,889 --> 01:04:55,210
Welcome.

1230
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:11,420
Okay, this is it.

1231
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:13,949
Opportunity here.

1232
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,630
Wait, it's different.

1233
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:21,449
Bokey.

1234
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:29,929
Sort of psychic seal of approval.

1235
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:32,090
Make sure my collector ain't a fake.

1236
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,250
Come on, kid.

1237
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,210
Clock's a ticking.

1238
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:35,690
What do you think?

1239
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:36,329
Yeah, we're going to go.

1240
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,650
This is white hot.

1241
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:40,489
We snag a collector.

1242
01:05:40,489 --> 01:05:41,690
We're big league.

1243
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:42,570
Psychic mercenaries.

1244
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:44,170
Eyes on the road, please.

1245
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:45,769
That collector belongs to Lena.

1246
01:05:45,769 --> 01:05:46,650
The hell it does.

1247
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,489
I shelled out cash four years ago.

1248
01:05:48,489 --> 01:05:49,130
So you say.

1249
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:51,369
Don't you get it?

1250
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:53,050
Lexi never died.

1251
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:56,809
A face job and a lounge act worse than yours.

1252
01:05:57,449 --> 01:05:58,489
Max Mirage.

1253
01:05:58,489 --> 01:05:59,849
No, Wayne Newton.

1254
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:00,889
Come on, kid.

1255
01:06:00,889 --> 01:06:01,849
Get with the beat.

1256
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:03,929
That ponytail.

1257
01:06:04,969 --> 01:06:06,510
Okay, here we are.

1258
01:06:07,949 --> 01:06:14,039
And Sylvia.

1259
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:14,840
He's very small.

1260
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:16,440
What are you doing?

1261
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:16,920
Harry.

1262
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,960
I didn't know he's that small.

1263
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:21,079
Ask you the same question.

1264
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:23,000
Strictly insurance.

1265
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,159
Make sure you got the genuine goods.

1266
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,000
You ready?

1267
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,440
No, I got to tape my ankles.

1268
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:29,880
Let her rip.

1269
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:37,789
I'm way taller than that.

1270
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:40,250
Okay.

1271
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,090
You can go weirder.

1272
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:54,969
What?

1273
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:56,969
Much weirder.

1274
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:03,849
Take the lint out of your back pocket and stuff it into a chicken breast and eat it.

1275
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:11,130
Give me the collector.

1276
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:15,340
Well, let's get weird.

1277
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,840
Somebody call the fire department.

1278
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,400
Let's bail.

1279
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:27,050
Oh, hey.

1280
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:27,530
Sorry.

1281
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:29,400
It's yours.

1282
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,119
What?

1283
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:31,400
Fuck.

1284
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,010
Get a grip.

1285
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,050
Try short.

1286
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,090
Whose limo is this?

1287
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:38,170
This wasn't the deal.

1288
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:38,809
You're right.

1289
01:07:39,849 --> 01:07:40,090
Run.

1290
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:49,159
Yeah, I was a coward and he was toast, lightly buttered and burnt to a crisp.

1291
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:53,480
Max Mirage knew all the black diamond tricks, but he was never going to share them.

1292
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,400
What is this?

1293
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,559
It just went up on the curb.

1294
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:05,980
I've been looking for you for hours.

1295
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,340
Sorry, I was trying to help Moki.

1296
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,579
What happened?

1297
01:08:09,579 --> 01:08:10,300
Fried rice.

1298
01:08:11,929 --> 01:08:13,530
Max has three collectors.

1299
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:14,809
He's a lexian disguise.

1300
01:08:15,369 --> 01:08:16,090
What's new with you?

1301
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:17,850
Monica.

1302
01:08:18,489 --> 01:08:19,689
How do we get out of this mess?

1303
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:23,100
By making Q stronger.

1304
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:23,979
I got to get stronger.

1305
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:25,579
Okay.

1306
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:26,380
Yeah, here we go.

1307
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,819
Back to the mansion.

1308
01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:33,979
She has to see it alone and I'll wait in here.

1309
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:34,779
Wait.

1310
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:35,420
Look.

1311
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,460
Come here.

1312
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,100
It's here.

1313
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,140
The fourth collector.

1314
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:41,529
Please, Eric.

1315
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:43,529
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1316
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:44,329
I've missed them all.

1317
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:44,890
I missed them all.

1318
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:45,529
I didn't know what to do.

1319
01:08:46,329 --> 01:08:49,470
I was going to go to Madame T.

1320
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,520
Jeremy, you stink.

1321
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:07,770
Hey, I'm not going to get the same ending.

1322
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,680
He had the case hidden away.

1323
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,270
It's going to be the same ending.

1324
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:25,550
It's not going to be the same ending.

1325
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:38,510
He's strong because he has more of those collectors.

1326
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:42,590
I need all four to beat him in the mind game.

1327
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:45,050
All right, let's go to Madame T.

1328
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:46,489
While we're still time.

1329
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,090
Lexi killed your father.

1330
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,180
How do you think?

1331
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,180
I don't touch stuff so I can sniff my fingers.

1332
01:09:54,909 --> 01:09:55,789
Lexi is Max.

1333
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:57,960
He came here with a collector,

1334
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,800
started frying Vladimir inside out.

1335
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:10,029
Did they say Lexi is Max with like plastic surgery?

1336
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:13,149
He said he got his face changed and stuff.

1337
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:17,020
And then did he say that?

1338
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:18,699
I'm confused by that.

1339
01:10:18,699 --> 01:10:19,500
Anna.

1340
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:24,779
Oh, right.

1341
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,180
Smothering the old lady.

1342
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:30,460
I'm going to work me over, Clash.

1343
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:34,560
What do I do?

1344
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,359
What do I do?

1345
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,960
Is that considered a promotion?

1346
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,000
Zip it, Fox.

1347
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,119
I don't blame him.

1348
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:44,640
Monica's a cute little thing.

1349
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:46,560
Unforced beauty.

1350
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,600
Only 21.

1351
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,479
I'm not biting.

1352
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:51,949
She and Max, we're talking a serious item here.

1353
01:10:51,949 --> 01:10:53,949
We're talking ransom.

1354
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,229
That's about all.

1355
01:10:55,229 --> 01:10:58,189
You want her back, you bring the fourth collector.

1356
01:10:58,189 --> 01:11:01,550
And of course, I decided to break her neck just to piss you all.

1357
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,560
I saved her.

1358
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:06,560
How could you, Eric?

1359
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,560
No, you do good.

1360
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,279
See?

1361
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:10,720
You see the itch.

1362
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,159
You love the itch.

1363
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,600
She will betray him.

1364
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:16,960
I think we just...

1365
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,960
Get the collector.

1366
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,640
Go to Max.

1367
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:23,039
Challenge him the game.

1368
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,279
Why not get the collector?

1369
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,640
Hide for Max.

1370
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,520
Play with the collector.

1371
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,520
He is too powerful.

1372
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:34,399
If you do not stop him, he will hunt you like a dog.

1373
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:35,600
I never got to practice.

1374
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:39,359
Find the scar.

1375
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:42,399
Choose me if you can.

1376
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:42,960
I'll choose her.

1377
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,760
It doesn't make sense.

1378
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:47,359
Not all the games make sense.

1379
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:48,720
Not all the games make sense.

1380
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,760
It's a Christopher Walken character.

1381
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,720
Let me try it.

1382
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,000
You must not deplete yourself.

1383
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,560
She's in the car?

1384
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,920
I'm the hope, okay?

1385
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,239
The old lady said, Eric, you're the boss.

1386
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,039
You play Lexie.

1387
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:00,000
You put your ass on the hibachi, not your bossy burnout sidekick.

1388
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:03,640
No, I don't want to confront him, though.

1389
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,359
I'm sorry we have to fight.

1390
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:06,439
Choose her and the shoe.

1391
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:14,840
Should I?

1392
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,520
Should we go in there, though?

1393
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,399
Or should we do something else?

1394
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,159
Because look, it's like, oh, go get him.

1395
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,840
We don't have to, though, do we?

1396
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,390
Fuck you, game.

1397
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:29,439
Okay, so what's the play here?

1398
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:42,140
It's Madame T, shoe, cigarette, cigarette.

1399
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,479
It's a walkthrough.

1400
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:48,279
I guess I could, couldn't I?

1401
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:49,869
Does it really matter?

1402
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:58,270
Let's see.

1403
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,189
Does anybody even have a walkthrough for this game?

1404
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:15,520
Okay, if I remember this part.

1405
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,199
Don't squeeze me out.

1406
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,479
But she's a Karelian and so photogenic.

1407
01:13:26,329 --> 01:13:27,050
Okay, let me see.

1408
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:38,359
Oh, tricks to play Black Diamond.

1409
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:42,680
Anna, the kite, Monica, or Lena are powerful.

1410
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:48,359
Monica's weakness is with the doll and Moki.

1411
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,880
And Lena is a draw with the doll and Sergi.

1412
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,560
I think I would ever figure this out on my own.

1413
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:15,069
Hey, I left her alone.

1414
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:16,140
I'm scared.

1415
01:14:16,939 --> 01:14:19,399
I left her for him.

1416
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:28,189
Queen B is all hot and bothered.

1417
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:29,229
I gotta rub that itch.

1418
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:32,890
If you must.

1419
01:14:33,449 --> 01:14:34,970
Just let me hang on to this.

1420
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:36,960
We're trying a different tactic.

1421
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,069
Wait in there.

1422
01:14:41,149 --> 01:14:42,989
I got no time for catfights.

1423
01:14:42,989 --> 01:14:43,470
Now move.

1424
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:46,909
Am I telling her to wait while I go spend time with this girl?

1425
01:14:47,869 --> 01:14:49,229
Wait, what?

1426
01:15:07,289 --> 01:15:11,050
You know, I'm rooting for you way deep down.

1427
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:12,250
Can you help me beat Max?

1428
01:15:13,689 --> 01:15:14,729
Oh, right.

1429
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,760
Creamsicle Moki?

1430
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,119
Okay.

1431
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:29,310
Which one of these is your favorite?

1432
01:15:31,229 --> 01:15:32,029
Soldier.

1433
01:15:32,029 --> 01:15:32,590
Good.

1434
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:33,470
I'll tell you what.

1435
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:38,939
You can have it, but I need to know what happened to you.

1436
01:15:41,949 --> 01:15:42,430
Scary.

1437
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:47,020
What happened to him?

1438
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,300
Why is he like three?

1439
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,579
Do you remember where you were?

1440
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,949
Do you know where Eric Fox is?

1441
01:15:55,789 --> 01:16:08,920
I'm here for me to adore there.

1442
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,310
There's nobody in this audience.

1443
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:14,029
Play your little hide and seek.

1444
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:15,630
It's megalomaniac.

1445
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,939
Only one game matters.

1446
01:16:18,939 --> 01:16:19,979
I don't think so.

1447
01:16:23,069 --> 01:16:25,659
What just happened?

1448
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:29,689
When he's properly cooked.

1449
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:31,609
Wait, we were just dead.

1450
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:34,810
You took your time, Jim Chushika.

1451
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:36,380
But you gave me all four.

1452
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,340
Who's that dude?

1453
01:16:38,539 --> 01:16:40,939
Edik Tartu, Lexi.

1454
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:43,100
Go on, get her out of here.

1455
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:43,899
I want my sister.

1456
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,619
But I'm so very fond of the Bozark family.

1457
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:54,460
We were too busy watching the little kid play with toys.

1458
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,020
Can we sort of skip the male bonding?

1459
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:01,770
As you wish.

1460
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:04,090
The old man only cared about results.

1461
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:06,010
Total neuralytic paralysis.

1462
01:17:06,649 --> 01:17:09,130
But how do you destroy someone mentally?

1463
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:10,649
You take their fear.

1464
01:17:10,649 --> 01:17:11,529
Okay, what is he afraid of?

1465
01:17:11,529 --> 01:17:14,890
Traumas and nightmares and turn them up.

1466
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:19,689
Full volume, a hideous marching band at the back of the brain.

1467
01:17:20,329 --> 01:17:25,289
All very amusing with rabbits and mice and half dead soldiers.

1468
01:17:26,489 --> 01:17:29,020
When two people know what's happening.

1469
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:29,899
Okay.

1470
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:31,420
Two talented people.

1471
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:33,500
It's really a most fascinating game.

1472
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,140
Two.

1473
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,260
You have your thoughts.

1474
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,100
I have mine.

1475
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:37,600
Three.

1476
01:17:38,539 --> 01:17:42,569
And winner takes...

1477
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:43,069
Four.

1478
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,609
He activated the four pillars.

1479
01:17:46,569 --> 01:17:47,130
Here we go.

1480
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:48,350
Okay.

1481
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:53,630
So who is it?

1482
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:54,430
Who's Anna?

1483
01:17:55,069 --> 01:17:58,460
The cat.

1484
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,100
He's afraid of the cat.

1485
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,739
He's afraid of the cat.

1486
01:17:59,739 --> 01:18:00,220
He's afraid of the cat.

1487
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:00,699
He's afraid of the cat.

1488
01:18:00,699 --> 01:18:01,579
He's gonna fear cats.

1489
01:18:01,579 --> 01:18:02,569
Go on.

1490
01:18:02,569 --> 01:18:03,609
Pick a pretty picture.

1491
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:04,329
Madame.

1492
01:18:04,329 --> 01:18:05,050
Definitely Madame.

1493
01:18:05,609 --> 01:18:08,060
We need Madame in there.

1494
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:08,859
She said use her.

1495
01:18:09,579 --> 01:18:10,460
I think he's afraid of cats.

1496
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:16,119
Cigarette?

1497
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:18,279
I think I'm gonna use the cat.

1498
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,560
Okay.

1499
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,199
Now what else?

1500
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:28,560
Which one of these is Monica?

1501
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,399
Which one of these is Lena?

1502
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,039
The shoe?

1503
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:31,760
There is no shoe.

1504
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:34,720
Cigarette?

1505
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:36,590
Cigarette?

1506
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,340
Or skull?

1507
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:39,539
Cigarette?

1508
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:41,020
All right.

1509
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:41,979
We got one more choice here.

1510
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:44,649
Left or right?

1511
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:51,079
I don't know which one of these is who.

1512
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,960
Skull?

1513
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:58,640
Left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left.

1514
01:18:59,199 --> 01:18:59,939
Okay.

1515
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:00,739
Let's do it.

1516
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:06,380
Your move.

1517
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:06,699
My move.

1518
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:08,140
Try to be interesting.

1519
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:08,460
Okay.

1520
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,979
So cigarette versus...

1521
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,300
Cat versus cigarette.

1522
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:12,699
No.

1523
01:19:12,699 --> 01:19:14,939
Cat smoke cigarette versus doll.

1524
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,800
Cigarette versus...

1525
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,100
Uh...

1526
01:19:22,909 --> 01:19:23,390
Shoe.

1527
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:24,029
There's no shoe.

1528
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:27,199
You want me to hum the Jeopardy theme?

1529
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,359
Don't let the cat smoke.

1530
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:29,859
I'm not.

1531
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:33,000
Old woman to red square.

1532
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,289
Okay.

1533
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:36,810
Old woman to red square?

1534
01:19:41,289 --> 01:19:41,789
Yes.

1535
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:45,409
Got it.

1536
01:19:54,939 --> 01:19:55,439
Good.

1537
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:55,819
All right.

1538
01:19:55,819 --> 01:19:56,319
Good move.

1539
01:19:59,039 --> 01:19:59,539
No!

1540
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,119
It means whatever I want it to mean.

1541
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:09,619
Cat dead.

1542
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:12,680
Uh-oh.

1543
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,000
Okay.

1544
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:13,560
Now we need...

1545
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:15,819
Uh...

1546
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:16,619
Cigarette ver...

1547
01:20:16,619 --> 01:20:17,119
Uh...

1548
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:20,500
I don't know.

1549
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:22,829
Old lady versus doll?

1550
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:25,550
Or late girl versus doll?

1551
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:26,590
Cigarette versus skull?

1552
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:32,430
Cigarette versus skull.

1553
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:34,649
Yes.

1554
01:20:34,649 --> 01:20:36,409
I would be paralyzed as well.

1555
01:20:36,409 --> 01:20:41,739
I'm just wondering who cares in all caps.

1556
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:45,020
Cigarette on lady?

1557
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,029
On cigarette on lady?

1558
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,649
Oh, they canceled each other out.

1559
01:20:50,649 --> 01:20:51,149
Shit.

1560
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:53,399
A lot of real estate for a landmine.

1561
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:53,880
Okay.

1562
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:54,380
Come on.

1563
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:56,130
Come on.

1564
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:58,130
Oh!

1565
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:00,779
All right.

1566
01:21:00,779 --> 01:21:02,779
We got old lady versus doll.

1567
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:04,590
This is all we can do.

1568
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:05,390
This is it.

1569
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:06,189
Come on.

1570
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:07,939
Yes!

1571
01:21:12,109 --> 01:21:12,609
I win.

1572
01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:29,899
Why is he three feet tall?

1573
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:33,520
Oh.

1574
01:21:33,819 --> 01:21:34,319
Oh.

1575
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:37,939
Never mind.

1576
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:51,899
Okay.

1577
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:52,779
Conclusions.

1578
01:21:52,779 --> 01:21:53,279
Uh...

1579
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:54,670
Oh.

1580
01:21:54,829 --> 01:21:55,329
Oh.

1581
01:21:55,329 --> 01:21:55,949
I got...

1582
01:21:55,949 --> 01:21:56,590
I know what...

1583
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:57,710
I know what this is.

1584
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:58,829
I get it now.

1585
01:21:58,829 --> 01:21:59,390
I get it.

1586
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:00,510
These are all the endings.

1587
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:03,470
That makes sense.

1588
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:03,789
Sure.

1589
01:22:03,789 --> 01:22:05,310
Okay.

1590
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,310
So we had double war last time.

1591
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:07,550
Oh no.

1592
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:08,829
What did we have last time?

1593
01:22:08,829 --> 01:22:16,449
The big kiss.

1594
01:22:16,449 --> 01:22:17,810
The grand slam.

1595
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:18,850
No third chances.

1596
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,539
Double war.

1597
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:22,420
Maximum Eric.

1598
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,569
Maximum Eric.

1599
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:31,250
What's the big kiss?

1600
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:34,930
I have no idea.

1601
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:35,970
No shit, dude.

1602
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:38,899
Is it that obvious?

1603
01:22:39,869 --> 01:22:41,310
We want Maximum Eric.

1604
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:41,949
I want...

1605
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:43,390
I don't know how to do that.

1606
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,380
So this is the only walkthrough that I could really...

1607
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,500
One of the walkthroughs that I found

1608
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,619
gave like a bunch of just like random info

1609
01:22:53,619 --> 01:22:54,899
and then at the end says

1610
01:22:54,899 --> 01:22:56,020
for different endings,

1611
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:57,539
you can try to play this game again.

1612
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:00,579
Sorry if you find difficulty with this walkthrough.

1613
01:23:00,579 --> 01:23:01,699
And then that's it.

1614
01:23:01,699 --> 01:23:04,899
Who the fuck was gonna make a walkthrough for this game?

1615
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:05,300
I can't...

1616
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:05,619
I don't know.

1617
01:23:05,619 --> 01:23:09,380
I'm not gonna be able to get Maximum Eric.

1618
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:09,779
Hold on.

1619
01:23:09,779 --> 01:23:10,420
All right.

1620
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,779
Maximum Eric ending.

1621
01:23:14,779 --> 01:23:16,220
Psychic Detective.

1622
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:22,750
Psychic Detective strategy guy.

1623
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:26,060
I don't know.

1624
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:27,100
Maximum Eric time.

1625
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:28,300
YouTube it.

1626
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:32,529
Nobody has this on YouTube.

1627
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:33,890
Cheat code central.

1628
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:38,220
Due to the interactive nature of this title,

1629
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:39,739
there are many ways to complete the game.

1630
01:23:39,739 --> 01:23:42,140
The game can finish in one of several endings.

1631
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:44,260
Although the following walkthrough

1632
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,699
may not be the most optimal,

1633
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:49,060
it does expose most of the major plot themes.

1634
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,979
Note the solution branches at several points

1635
01:23:50,979 --> 01:23:52,659
in order to reach different endings.

1636
01:23:52,659 --> 01:23:53,220
Okay.

1637
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:59,340
Hold on a minute.

1638
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:04,319
So the Grand Slam solution is the best ending.

1639
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:04,720
They go...

1640
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,840
I think these are ranked

1641
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,359
in how good of an ending they are.

1642
01:24:09,329 --> 01:24:10,210
If you want to know,

1643
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:14,510
Moki's Playmate is you play the entire game

1644
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:16,670
without making a single choice.

1645
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:19,069
You just let it do whatever it's going to do.

1646
01:24:19,069 --> 01:24:23,420
That's how you get that ending.

1647
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:26,220
So, I mean, I don't...

1648
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:27,340
We wait at the...

1649
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:29,180
We want to go back and just watch the whole thing

1650
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,279
to see what happens.

1651
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,319
Watch it again.

1652
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:37,920
Okay.

1653
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,239
All right.

1654
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:38,800
Let's see.

1655
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,560
Let's at least get the worst ending in the whole game.

1656
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,199
Okay.

1657
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:52,739
I'm seeing a lot more yeses than I see nos.

1658
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:53,699
Look, you can't just write...

1659
01:24:53,699 --> 01:24:54,819
You can't just write...

1660
01:24:54,819 --> 01:24:55,300
Fuck off.

1661
01:24:55,859 --> 01:24:57,310
Do them all.

1662
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:02,800
I'm not going to do them all.

1663
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,359
All right.

1664
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:05,359
What's the Village Idiot?

1665
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:05,760
Hold on.

1666
01:25:10,609 --> 01:25:15,420
Maximum Eric solution.

1667
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:20,319
Hold on.

1668
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:23,279
Yeah, that's real specific shit

1669
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:27,619
in a lot of these later endings.

1670
01:25:27,619 --> 01:25:28,100
No.

1671
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:28,739
All right.

1672
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:30,180
We're going to do the dogshit ending.

1673
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:35,550
Who owns the secret room?

1674
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:35,949
I don't know.

1675
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:46,159
I'm just going to sit here back here

1676
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:48,670
and drink some coffee and hang out.

1677
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,430
Make us click the ending we want.

1678
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:52,029
Guys, I can't even get the solutions

1679
01:25:52,029 --> 01:25:52,670
to these endings.

1680
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:53,470
There's so many of them

1681
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:55,310
and none of them have any guides.

1682
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:56,430
And the game is such a mess

1683
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:58,270
that I can't do them all.

1684
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:00,819
Okay, here we go.

1685
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,819
I am going to put the controller down.

1686
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:03,939
I'm not going to touch anything.

1687
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:04,420
See what happens.

1688
01:26:09,569 --> 01:26:09,970
Here we go.

1689
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,359
That's my sister, Monica.

1690
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:20,560
Cute.

1691
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,560
Very cute.

1692
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,000
Very weak and gullible.

1693
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,760
Who's the plastic dress?

1694
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,989
Maybe you can find out for me.

1695
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:32,510
Thank you for streaming.

1696
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:33,229
You make a lot of...

1697
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:33,710
And Tim.

1698
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:34,210
Oh, thanks.

1699
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:37,090
I don't know.

1700
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:37,729
That's Moki, right?

1701
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:44,590
There's money to be made.

1702
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:45,710
He smells it.

1703
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,250
Keep an eye on him.

1704
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:47,890
So I just don't...

1705
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:48,689
And Monica.

1706
01:26:48,689 --> 01:26:49,250
...pour it over.

1707
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,609
I don't warg into anybody.

1708
01:26:54,979 --> 01:26:55,539
So what happens?

1709
01:26:55,539 --> 01:26:56,340
I just stand around?

1710
01:27:06,289 --> 01:27:07,489
Normal man ending.

1711
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:09,729
Yeah, I'm just a guy.

1712
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:18,770
We missed this part.

1713
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:43,939
What a shitty game.

1714
01:27:43,939 --> 01:27:44,659
Holy...

1715
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:45,619
Oh my God.

1716
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:52,430
You made a board and don't have any rules?

1717
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:53,869
And then you're selling it as a board game.

1718
01:27:59,869 --> 01:28:01,229
This lady had found her niche.

1719
01:28:03,970 --> 01:28:05,569
House party from hell.

1720
01:28:05,569 --> 01:28:07,409
Not even a decent bean dip.

1721
01:28:07,409 --> 01:28:08,930
I was getting itchy fingers.

1722
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,449
I went fishing for knickknacks.

1723
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,550
About nine steps up.

1724
01:28:14,109 --> 01:28:14,670
What'd you think?

1725
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:16,510
I couldn't tell.

1726
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:17,390
You keep moving.

1727
01:28:18,029 --> 01:28:19,069
Even when you trespass.

1728
01:28:19,069 --> 01:28:19,630
Yeah, I like...

1729
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:20,829
I love a good bean dip, too.

1730
01:28:20,829 --> 01:28:22,510
Driving into our part of you is asleep.

1731
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:24,590
Hey, no one does autopot like Eric Bach.

1732
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:25,090
I do.

1733
01:28:26,989 --> 01:28:28,500
There he is again.

1734
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,619
Still don't know him, huh?

1735
01:28:31,329 --> 01:28:33,489
Oh, just some greasy little man.

1736
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:35,970
Not like you, my sweet boy.

1737
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:36,850
That's who he's talking...

1738
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:37,890
That's who she's talking about.

1739
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:41,970
Felt like a good time to get acquainted with dad.

1740
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:45,170
What worked in the pookaloo was bound to work around here.

1741
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:50,850
The house had seen better days.

1742
01:28:51,489 --> 01:28:53,409
Better days, worse days.

1743
01:28:53,409 --> 01:28:55,409
It was just starting to give a big wet kiss.

1744
01:28:55,409 --> 01:28:58,210
Dude, when we get to the point where the guy dies in that room,

1745
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,569
we're gonna get to see it this time.

1746
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:20,880
There's a lot of shit here that we did not look at.

1747
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:23,359
We just looked out the window and then ran down the stairs.

1748
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:27,539
Ten to one.

1749
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,380
Secbethpah meant confidential.

1750
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,739
That sounded like a good time.

1751
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:47,659
Didn't anybody crack a smile in this country?

1752
01:29:47,659 --> 01:29:49,500
Doesn't Moki show all these photos here?

1753
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,579
Maybe this was Papa Scrapbook of golden memories.

1754
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,859
So how come I had a full-on case of the ripple in the ions?

1755
01:29:59,229 --> 01:30:01,069
These people were running a game.

1756
01:30:01,069 --> 01:30:02,590
A game I couldn't quite see.

1757
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:05,390
Yeah, remember Moki shows all these pictures?

1758
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:07,710
He stole them from here.

1759
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:16,739
Okay.

1760
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:20,380
I got more than I bargained for.

1761
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:22,539
Like sneaking into someone else's nightmare.

1762
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,300
Feeling right at home.

1763
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,539
What the fuck are these drawings?

1764
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,140
Who drew these?

1765
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,270
I must ask you to go.

1766
01:30:47,069 --> 01:30:48,829
Your uncle was a big noise.

1767
01:30:48,829 --> 01:30:50,430
A real player in the old country.

1768
01:30:51,649 --> 01:30:53,329
Paranormal espionage.

1769
01:30:53,329 --> 01:30:54,449
That's all I'm allowed to say.

1770
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:58,369
But perhaps you would be interested in a little collectible.

1771
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:01,810
Chester, he's shameless.

1772
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,279
Maybe I was trying too hard.

1773
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,319
Maybe I stubbed my brain on something.

1774
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:11,600
Because I was hearing voices.

1775
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:12,800
Big time.

1776
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:15,199
That's right.

1777
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:17,439
Come this way.

1778
01:31:18,689 --> 01:31:19,569
All the way.

1779
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:23,470
Time to pay me a visit.

1780
01:31:23,470 --> 01:31:24,750
Weren't we in somebody else's head at this point?

1781
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:27,250
Let's walk around in a circle.

1782
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:33,439
I am Ikunos.

1783
01:31:34,539 --> 01:31:44,560
Madame Ikunos.

1784
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,479
This was the tutorial that we missed.

1785
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:52,340
Quite the spread.

1786
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:54,989
We don't clean up after this lady.

1787
01:31:54,989 --> 01:31:57,149
She's got like five empty coffee containers.

1788
01:31:57,789 --> 01:31:58,109
Oh.

1789
01:31:59,069 --> 01:31:59,310
Well.

1790
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:01,390
That's interesting.

1791
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:01,869
Never mind.

1792
01:32:01,869 --> 01:32:02,909
I didn't say that.

1793
01:32:02,909 --> 01:32:08,689
The one with the gift, smell it.

1794
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:09,489
Yeah.

1795
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:12,130
You smell anything in here, you've got your own gift.

1796
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,420
I made a mental note.

1797
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:15,939
Be less amusing.

1798
01:32:15,939 --> 01:32:16,979
Did I say she smells?

1799
01:32:16,979 --> 01:32:18,180
Come and sit.

1800
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:21,520
But not to touch the game.

1801
01:32:22,319 --> 01:32:23,199
It is bad.

1802
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,979
The devil itself.

1803
01:32:25,979 --> 01:32:30,319
What happened?

1804
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:30,960
I didn't touch anything.

1805
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:31,680
Bravo.

1806
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,500
A marvelous raw talent.

1807
01:32:36,539 --> 01:32:36,939
Thanks.

1808
01:32:37,579 --> 01:32:40,159
You cannot do this with everybody.

1809
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:45,279
Only with another psychic mind can you explore and talk.

1810
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,270
Or do the nasty things.

1811
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:51,710
I think I'll take a rain check.

1812
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:55,229
And only another psychic mind can show you.

1813
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:57,229
She's trying to hit on me here?

1814
01:32:58,029 --> 01:33:05,520
And only some of us can, you know, do the sex in our heads.

1815
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,479
I'm one of them.

1816
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:07,920
I'm available.

1817
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,100
There's only three people on earth that can do this.

1818
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:13,920
How can you?

1819
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,079
You think it is a big joke?

1820
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:17,680
Playing with the power.

1821
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,560
Oh, come on.

1822
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,600
It's a living.

1823
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,800
Mental sleight of hand.

1824
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,079
It is more.

1825
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:28,109
You are the only one who can stop him.

1826
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:29,310
Stop who?

1827
01:33:32,539 --> 01:33:33,579
Where is Chad?

1828
01:33:33,579 --> 01:33:34,460
In the study.

1829
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:35,899
Quickly.

1830
01:33:35,899 --> 01:33:36,460
Go to him.

1831
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:43,010
Oh, no.

1832
01:33:43,010 --> 01:33:44,050
Chad's dead.

1833
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:47,199
What happens if you don't touch anything, though?

1834
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,720
You don't say anything or do anything deep sleep?

1835
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,520
I'm assuming if you pick up the knife, everyone goes, he did it.

1836
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,239
And you get arrested and you go to disc three automatically, right?

1837
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:04,500
It didn't take a genius to play it out.

1838
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,859
I was coming down.

1839
01:34:05,859 --> 01:34:07,060
She was going up.

1840
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:09,380
The door prize was a hunk of blood pudding.

1841
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:17,140
Time to go.

1842
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:19,779
Chad sort of made a mess.

1843
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:20,260
Let's go.

1844
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:24,399
Okay.

1845
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:26,079
Incoming disc two.

1846
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,659
This is great.

1847
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:35,329
I'm going to hold on to this one.

1848
01:34:35,329 --> 01:34:37,250
I'm going to keep this in a glass case.

1849
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:43,779
I'm going to hand down psychic detective to my grandchildren.

1850
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:44,340
Oh, shit.

1851
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:46,020
Was that just two or just three?

1852
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,119
No, we're good.

1853
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:55,300
Green vented.

1854
01:34:56,699 --> 01:34:57,659
Oh, I see what you're doing.

1855
01:34:58,529 --> 01:34:59,170
I see what you're doing.

1856
01:35:00,029 --> 01:35:00,829
I kind of get it.

1857
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:02,029
Although I don't.

1858
01:35:02,770 --> 01:35:06,050
You know, I watch people stream among us and I have absolutely no idea what's going on.

1859
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:07,569
I just kind of pretend like I do.

1860
01:35:08,609 --> 01:35:10,050
And then they just all start yelling at each other.

1861
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:12,449
I sat there knowing two things dead certain.

1862
01:35:12,449 --> 01:35:17,970
Layne was going to drag me in deeper and I was going to follow like some over sex schnauzer.

1863
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,520
What's that mean?

1864
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:25,920
It means stop it.

1865
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:26,880
All right.

1866
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,880
This may sound like your dad really did jump out the window, but not exactly suicide.

1867
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,159
He's still playing this.

1868
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:35,279
Well, actually, I don't know.

1869
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:35,680
You're wrong.

1870
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,880
Someone was messing with his head.

1871
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,399
I'm not playing this at all.

1872
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:40,720
Actually, I'm sitting here without the controller in my hand.

1873
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,220
What's that?

1874
01:35:42,289 --> 01:35:45,560
Um, well, you know that he's dead.

1875
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:47,880
I'm still trying to get used to it.

1876
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,239
Yeah, right.

1877
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:51,479
You sure look busted up about it.

1878
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,279
This ending is going to suck, too.

1879
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:56,960
It's not going to be worth doing this a third time.

1880
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,000
Watch, Monica.

1881
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,880
Just a little more.

1882
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,760
I do not trust this mirage quest.

1883
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,199
You're going?

1884
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:05,029
I have to.

1885
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:06,470
Don't ask why.

1886
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:08,869
Just hate me if you must.

1887
01:36:09,909 --> 01:36:13,670
What's that face I can do?

1888
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:14,789
I can do like a sad face.

1889
01:36:14,789 --> 01:36:16,069
I can do a sad reaction.

1890
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:17,189
I missed that.

1891
01:36:17,989 --> 01:36:19,590
Oh, I would have done the sad reaction.

1892
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:20,710
Oh, you idiot.

1893
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:22,470
How come I never thought about going home?

1894
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:28,720
Wait, do I go home?

1895
01:36:34,359 --> 01:36:35,159
Hey, bright boy.

1896
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:36,920
Want to get arrested?

1897
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,439
Go sit in the cop car.

1898
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:39,079
How are you?

1899
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,079
Moki found dead.

1900
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:43,750
You're that psychic kid.

1901
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:44,470
Flasho.

1902
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:45,670
Flash in the pan.

1903
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:47,270
I've seen the act.

1904
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:48,390
Moki's plaything.

1905
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:50,310
To my pal, Moki.

1906
01:36:50,869 --> 01:36:52,149
Listen, you little putz.

1907
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:53,350
You're flying blind.

1908
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:54,630
You need Moki.

1909
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:56,149
Moki knows the dirt.

1910
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:57,670
I collected.

1911
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:59,350
Stored in my cheeks.

1912
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:00,630
That would explain the breath.

1913
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:03,510
Listen, you do me a little job.

1914
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:04,229
I clue you in.

1915
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:05,829
We also could have followed Monica, too.

1916
01:37:05,829 --> 01:37:06,949
That could have been interesting.

1917
01:37:06,949 --> 01:37:08,149
Time's a-wasting.

1918
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:13,239
It's a midnight sale.

1919
01:37:13,239 --> 01:37:15,640
Come on, now's the time, Foxy.

1920
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,520
Take it or leave it.

1921
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,479
Two exotic bombshells.

1922
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:21,439
I end up with you.

1923
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:22,479
Hey, kid.

1924
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:23,920
You haven't seen me dance.

1925
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:29,720
You know how they pronounce it?

1926
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:31,979
Frick.

1927
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:34,920
What assholes.

1928
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:35,420
So?

1929
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:37,479
So, history lesson.

1930
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:40,760
The Black Diamond Campfire Girls.

1931
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,680
Circa 1987.

1932
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,479
It's the Resident Evil 7 family.

1933
01:37:45,479 --> 01:37:46,680
Vladimir Potsok.

1934
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,949
The KGB kissed his ass.

1935
01:37:48,949 --> 01:37:49,909
Like it was sable.

1936
01:37:49,909 --> 01:37:50,789
Know why?

1937
01:37:50,789 --> 01:37:52,199
He made a little toy.

1938
01:37:53,079 --> 01:37:55,159
The Psychic Collector.

1939
01:37:58,930 --> 01:38:00,050
Lil' Lena.

1940
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:02,529
Damn good psychic.

1941
01:38:02,529 --> 01:38:05,329
But a skitzy broad with a psychopathic papa.

1942
01:38:05,329 --> 01:38:06,529
Boo hoo.

1943
01:38:06,609 --> 01:38:07,810
And a Slasnewitz.

1944
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:08,850
Eight years old.

1945
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:11,409
She boils a cup of tea by looking at him.

1946
01:38:12,689 --> 01:38:13,569
Batting clean up.

1947
01:38:14,289 --> 01:38:15,970
Lexi Golitsyn.

1948
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:16,850
Power hungry.

1949
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:17,890
Perk hungry.

1950
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:18,369
Borscht.

1951
01:38:18,369 --> 01:38:19,890
Turn myself into Moki.

1952
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:21,409
Morty, I'm Moki.

1953
01:38:21,409 --> 01:38:22,529
I'm Moki, Morty.

1954
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:23,250
Sergei Zansko.

1955
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:25,619
Your rival.

1956
01:38:25,619 --> 01:38:26,819
It's not even funny.

1957
01:38:27,619 --> 01:38:28,739
I'm laughing at it, though.

1958
01:38:28,739 --> 01:38:29,380
I don't know why.

1959
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,220
Because this makes no fucking sense,

1960
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:31,779
what you just said.

1961
01:38:31,779 --> 01:38:32,340
Double the pain.

1962
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:33,829
Who's all for?

1963
01:38:33,829 --> 01:38:38,840
We're talking frontal lobe trauma.

1964
01:38:39,479 --> 01:38:41,640
I turned myself into Moki, Morty.

1965
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:42,680
Here's the key.

1966
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:46,760
Do piggyback inside and get to Max Mirage's table.

1967
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,359
Main room, far left corner.

1968
01:38:48,359 --> 01:38:49,399
Maybe we go in.

1969
01:38:49,399 --> 01:38:50,680
It's not like I use a map.

1970
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,359
Hey, I wouldn't know.

1971
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:54,239
I'm not psychic.

1972
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:55,840
I don't have the sexy gift.

1973
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,000
I just come from a clean straight shot home

1974
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,119
where nobody mess me up.

1975
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:00,960
What's that supposed to mean?

1976
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,520
It means I know things.

1977
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,199
As usual.

1978
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:07,920
Moki, Andy.

1979
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:09,409
That's fine.

1980
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,000
Yeah, sure.

1981
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,159
There's a phone call coming in two minutes.

1982
01:39:14,119 --> 01:39:15,079
Be there for it.

1983
01:39:15,079 --> 01:39:16,680
And don't screw me.

1984
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:25,699
No, I don't even go in.

1985
01:39:25,699 --> 01:39:26,579
Psychic bastard.

1986
01:39:26,579 --> 01:39:27,060
Where are you?

1987
01:39:27,699 --> 01:39:28,180
Inside?

1988
01:39:28,979 --> 01:39:30,020
Have we crossed the room?

1989
01:39:30,579 --> 01:39:33,909
Here we go, kid.

1990
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,159
It's the same path.

1991
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:39,279
Yeah, it is the same path.

1992
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:45,890
It's the same run.

1993
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,579
Are you telling me that me actively playing the game

1994
01:39:52,579 --> 01:39:56,979
versus the game playing itself is just as bad?

1995
01:39:58,579 --> 01:40:00,020
That seems fucking impossible.

1996
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:01,140
Yeah, I'm with you.

1997
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:03,319
Let's hear it.

1998
01:40:03,319 --> 01:40:04,520
You put the fear of God in him.

1999
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,880
Oh, for real?

2000
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,239
White as a ghost, Moke.

2001
01:40:07,239 --> 01:40:08,760
Anyone hear him talking roosties?

2002
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,960
Just the whole damn room.

2003
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,880
You're a lying little punk.

2004
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,600
Maybe I couldn't get there in time.

2005
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,279
Maybe you're full of crap.

2006
01:40:17,079 --> 01:40:19,880
Why don't you go peep the psychic slot?

2007
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,880
Why would this be Moki's playthrough?

2008
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:23,239
Or Moki's plaything?

2009
01:40:23,319 --> 01:40:25,720
If we don't do what he wants and he gets angry and runs away.

2010
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,439
If you're thinking of taking a ride in my head.

2011
01:40:38,119 --> 01:40:38,920
Eight, four, eight.

2012
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,119
There it is.

2013
01:40:41,189 --> 01:40:43,109
Okay, this part, I'm really...

2014
01:40:43,109 --> 01:40:44,789
I need to see what really happens here.

2015
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:45,430
Pizza!

2016
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:47,939
We know when you're hungry.

2017
01:40:47,939 --> 01:40:50,420
This dude is the guy that walks over with his hands on his chest,

2018
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,939
blood everywhere and the guy with the gun.

2019
01:40:51,939 --> 01:40:53,300
We keep missing this part.

2020
01:40:53,859 --> 01:40:54,899
Not this time.

2021
01:40:54,899 --> 01:40:56,899
Watch, Monica.

2022
01:40:56,899 --> 01:41:04,579
Learn everything, Eric.

2023
01:41:04,579 --> 01:41:05,300
Everything!

2024
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:07,760
Say something!

2025
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:08,079
Was that...

2026
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:09,760
Was there a hand over there?

2027
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,560
I quit.

2028
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,600
I could put a puncher?

2029
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,039
What the fuck was that?

2030
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:14,720
On principle, of course.

2031
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,000
Not because you're running away.

2032
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:17,760
Oh, you think I'm scared?

2033
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:20,819
You feel it.

2034
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:21,939
Even when you touch.

2035
01:41:22,739 --> 01:41:25,649
Just before the flash, it's there.

2036
01:41:26,529 --> 01:41:29,720
What happens if I don't come back?

2037
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:32,680
Or what happens if I come back like this?

2038
01:41:33,399 --> 01:41:42,399
Don't touch anything, don't touch anything.

2039
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:47,520
My father made this.

2040
01:41:49,029 --> 01:41:51,029
Not to teach or to feel better.

2041
01:41:51,989 --> 01:41:53,909
But to destroy my Sergey.

2042
01:41:53,909 --> 01:41:54,949
From inside out.

2043
01:41:55,989 --> 01:41:57,109
And you want me to use it?

2044
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,000
You will come back.

2045
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,689
You are the best I've seen.

2046
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,880
Okay, so now...

2047
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:09,439
No!

2048
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:10,079
No, no, no.

2049
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:10,880
I didn't do anything.

2050
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:11,279
Why is it...

2051
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:14,050
I didn't do anything.

2052
01:42:14,609 --> 01:42:18,069
It's not going to come back with him walking in with blood all over him, is it?

2053
01:42:18,069 --> 01:42:23,569
It's going to open.

2054
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:31,109
No, it's not.

2055
01:42:31,109 --> 01:42:31,510
It's not.

2056
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,960
Okay, don't do anything.

2057
01:42:49,619 --> 01:42:51,060
I want to see what's happening to him.

2058
01:43:02,899 --> 01:43:04,689
You must have...

2059
01:43:04,689 --> 01:43:05,170
Get out!

2060
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:08,159
You don't know what you say.

2061
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:14,210
You cannot hear him.

2062
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:15,489
You cannot protect.

2063
01:43:15,489 --> 01:43:16,810
Dracula.

2064
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:17,670
You won't accept.

2065
01:43:19,029 --> 01:43:22,800
Dracula.

2066
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:23,520
I miss him.

2067
01:43:28,689 --> 01:43:30,199
Stop it.

2068
01:43:30,659 --> 01:43:32,560
You will be adult.

2069
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,439
You will be...

2070
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:36,130
She's going to get...

2071
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:37,010
She's going to get the last...

2072
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:45,039
Okay, we're good.

2073
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:46,319
Now let's see what happens here.

2074
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:54,159
It can't be changed.

2075
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,079
You can't change it.

2076
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:58,920
Maybe you could have...

2077
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,239
Maybe you could have gone back and seen what they were doing, but...

2078
01:44:03,159 --> 01:44:07,220
You have the right to remain silent.

2079
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:08,420
You have the right to an attorney.

2080
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:12,760
Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law.

2081
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,260
Fine.

2082
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,840
Lock me in my cell.

2083
01:44:15,399 --> 01:44:17,239
I sure as hell couldn't keep me in my body.

2084
01:44:18,199 --> 01:44:20,199
You could have switched to that guy's POV.

2085
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:28,630
It's not going to be the same ending.

2086
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:30,069
It's going to be impossible to be the same ending.

2087
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:32,720
How long have you known Chad Kwiatkowski?

2088
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,239
Why delaying a one-year at the house?

2089
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:35,199
You boffing a kid?

2090
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:36,319
You want to be boffing us?

2091
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:37,920
What kind of game is she running?

2092
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,760
She's looking for a psychic collector.

2093
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:42,420
A whole bunch of people are looking for her.

2094
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:43,300
Her dad made him.

2095
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:44,020
Four of them.

2096
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:45,380
They're unbelievable.

2097
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:47,939
Sounded like some crystal-hugging hophead.

2098
01:44:47,939 --> 01:44:49,060
You wouldn't believe what can happen.

2099
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:51,640
Guys, I know this is hard to believe, but...

2100
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,479
There was only one way to slip this.

2101
01:44:54,199 --> 01:44:55,960
Find this damn collector myself.

2102
01:44:57,939 --> 01:45:00,500
I didn't even notice that face that got in leftist making.

2103
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:07,409
All right, here we go.

2104
01:45:07,409 --> 01:45:08,689
It's time for the conclusion.

2105
01:45:09,489 --> 01:45:11,329
They're not pressing a single button.

2106
01:45:11,329 --> 01:45:19,520
If we get the same ending, I'm going to be very, very mad.

2107
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:24,050
That would be upsetting to me.

2108
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:36,770
All right, I got the worst ending on my own.

2109
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,079
I don't think that was the worst ending.

2110
01:45:39,079 --> 01:45:40,680
I think it was a bad one, but not the worst one.

2111
01:45:41,239 --> 01:45:51,039
Hey, Fox.

2112
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:53,199
Be a good boy.

2113
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:54,399
No eight-dimension crap.

2114
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:01,409
Go to Bagman.

2115
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:02,789
I'll be honest.

2116
01:46:02,789 --> 01:46:07,000
I don't even know how I got to Bagman in the first place.

2117
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,659
What is this dork cube, Link?

2118
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:14,239
What the hell is dork cube?

2119
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:19,300
I was sick to death of trespassing, head-hopping, trance, being.

2120
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:22,739
I needed time to think, to figure out what I do next.

2121
01:46:22,739 --> 01:46:24,260
I'm not doing the feet thing right there.

2122
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:24,760
No.

2123
01:46:31,829 --> 01:46:33,909
Mayor Patterson answered allegations

2124
01:46:33,909 --> 01:46:37,670
that the murders may have been motivated by anti-Corellian sentiment.

2125
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:39,909
You won the black diamonds game last time.

2126
01:46:39,909 --> 01:46:41,750
That's the only thing that made it a good ending.

2127
01:46:43,239 --> 01:46:44,600
You got the worst good ending.

2128
01:46:59,319 --> 01:46:59,800
Hold on.

2129
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:00,359
Wait, wait, wait.

2130
01:47:13,909 --> 01:47:14,409
Great.

2131
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:16,060
Great.

2132
01:47:16,439 --> 01:47:17,319
Very cool, Link.

2133
01:47:21,479 --> 01:47:22,760
Crashing the website.

2134
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:29,079
Well, when like 6,000 people click on something at the same time,

2135
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,720
I'm going to assume it's not going to go very well.

2136
01:47:45,539 --> 01:47:46,340
It's so weird because when you...

2137
01:47:48,739 --> 01:47:49,539
Here's something weird.

2138
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:53,220
Your teeth make up a huge amount of the way that you look.

2139
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:56,180
That doesn't even look like me.

2140
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:57,619
It's because the teeth are different.

2141
01:47:57,619 --> 01:47:58,979
It looks like a different fucking person.

2142
01:48:01,539 --> 01:48:02,659
Like that fake mouth.

2143
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:04,020
It's just...

2144
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,060
I am a different person.

2145
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:21,659
New viewer.

2146
01:48:21,659 --> 01:48:36,899
I remember going to places like...

2147
01:48:37,539 --> 01:48:39,619
Because you guys know what Cold Stone is, right?

2148
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:46,250
Cold Stone Creamery did this thing where anytime you got a tip,

2149
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:48,789
and if you tipped anybody from Cold Stone,

2150
01:48:48,789 --> 01:48:50,390
they would have to sing this tip song.

2151
01:48:51,449 --> 01:48:52,649
And I remember always just thinking like,

2152
01:48:52,649 --> 01:48:53,529
they don't want...

2153
01:48:53,529 --> 01:48:55,689
Hey guys, we got a tip.

2154
01:48:55,689 --> 01:48:59,130
A tip just came in and we're really hip.

2155
01:48:59,130 --> 01:49:00,329
And then you could just tell it was like,

2156
01:49:00,329 --> 01:49:01,609
I don't want to fucking sing that.

2157
01:49:01,609 --> 01:49:02,329
So I would just...

2158
01:49:02,329 --> 01:49:03,689
I would put money in and be like,

2159
01:49:03,689 --> 01:49:04,409
you don't have to.

2160
01:49:04,409 --> 01:49:05,130
Just give it...

2161
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:06,649
You don't have to do it.

2162
01:49:06,649 --> 01:49:07,770
I'm just going to say you did.

2163
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:08,810
Yeah, I know you don't want to.

2164
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:09,529
You don't have to.

2165
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:10,489
You look disappointed.

2166
01:49:11,050 --> 01:49:13,289
Something for a pony or maybe a blonde.

2167
01:49:14,739 --> 01:49:16,180
I got a real job for you.

2168
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:16,819
A real gimme.

2169
01:49:16,819 --> 01:49:18,659
A thousand bucks and 30 minutes.

2170
01:49:18,659 --> 01:49:19,619
Doing what?

2171
01:49:19,619 --> 01:49:21,539
Sort of psychic seal of approval.

2172
01:49:21,539 --> 01:49:22,739
If they wanted to, sure.

2173
01:49:22,739 --> 01:49:24,260
I would sit there and fold my arms and be like,

2174
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:24,899
let me hear it.

2175
01:49:24,899 --> 01:49:26,020
Come on, kid.

2176
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:26,979
Clock's a ticking.

2177
01:49:30,069 --> 01:49:30,869
My pal!

2178
01:49:30,869 --> 01:49:31,670
I thought he just ran away.

2179
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:34,180
You just want to use the damn thing.

2180
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:36,020
Kid, this is white odd.

2181
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:37,859
We snag a collector.

2182
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:39,060
We're big league.

2183
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:40,020
Psychic mercenaries.

2184
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:41,539
You with the brain, me with the Rolodex.

2185
01:49:41,539 --> 01:49:43,060
In the bit song.

2186
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:43,939
The hell it does.

2187
01:49:43,939 --> 01:49:45,779
I shelled out cash four years ago.

2188
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:46,500
So you say.

2189
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,739
Don't you get it?

2190
01:49:48,739 --> 01:49:51,140
Lexi never died.

2191
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:54,180
A face job and a lounge act worse than yours.

2192
01:49:54,819 --> 01:49:55,859
Max Mirage?

2193
01:49:55,859 --> 01:49:57,220
No, Wayne Newton.

2194
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:58,260
Come on, kid.

2195
01:49:58,260 --> 01:49:59,140
Get with the beat.

2196
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:00,180
Yes, he does have a rat's head.

2197
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:00,579
Yes, he does.

2198
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:03,159
Okay, here we go.

2199
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:06,619
This is it.

2200
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:08,460
This is where it's going to...

2201
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:10,220
The path is going to branch here at this point

2202
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:10,939
because I'm not going to run.

2203
01:50:10,939 --> 01:50:11,739
Don't say it.

2204
01:50:11,739 --> 01:50:14,119
What are you doing hanging around?

2205
01:50:14,199 --> 01:50:18,489
I could ask you the same question.

2206
01:50:18,489 --> 01:50:20,409
Strictly insurance.

2207
01:50:20,409 --> 01:50:22,569
Make sure you got the genuine goods.

2208
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,899
No, I got to tame my ankles.

2209
01:50:26,699 --> 01:50:27,340
Let her rip.

2210
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:39,939
Don't move.

2211
01:50:47,829 --> 01:50:49,029
The real thing?

2212
01:50:49,029 --> 01:50:49,670
Yeah.

2213
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:50,789
Did the earth move?

2214
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:53,350
Oh, man.

2215
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:54,310
This is Bush League.

2216
01:50:56,329 --> 01:50:57,529
This is Bush League?

2217
01:50:57,529 --> 01:50:58,970
This wasn't the deal.

2218
01:50:58,970 --> 01:51:00,100
You're right.

2219
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:01,060
I feel just...

2220
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:11,340
Um.

2221
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:15,640
Did she take his hairpiece off?

2222
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:38,340
I'm your mommy now.

2223
01:51:38,979 --> 01:51:39,609
Okay.

2224
01:51:57,130 --> 01:51:58,250
Oh, hey, shit.

2225
01:51:58,250 --> 01:52:00,170
Monica, your car has got a lot of trash in it.

2226
01:52:00,890 --> 01:52:02,970
She does that thing when she freaks out.

2227
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:05,210
She's like moving all the McDonald's and Wendy's bags

2228
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:07,130
like deep into the bottom of the seat.

2229
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:07,850
Like, fuck, fuck.

2230
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:10,729
Ah, yeah, that's how I've been, you know, living out of my car.

2231
01:52:10,729 --> 01:52:11,770
You know, like we all do.

2232
01:52:13,829 --> 01:52:14,710
You just take your hand

2233
01:52:14,710 --> 01:52:16,390
and you drag it across the back seat

2234
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:17,590
desperately trying to make room

2235
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:18,550
and hope there's no stains.

2236
01:52:27,539 --> 01:52:28,500
What's wrong with me?

2237
01:52:33,449 --> 01:52:35,529
Think how you can train him.

2238
01:52:35,529 --> 01:52:36,489
Too much DMT?

2239
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:47,189
You find the village idiot,

2240
01:52:47,189 --> 01:52:50,069
make a special delivery, and then maybe...

2241
01:52:50,069 --> 01:52:52,630
No, that's not the ending that I want.

2242
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:12,100
Wait, did he just shoot the kid?

2243
01:53:29,819 --> 01:53:30,380
Take this.

2244
01:53:31,609 --> 01:53:32,890
Get the collector.

2245
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:36,090
Challenge Lexi the game.

2246
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:36,810
What do you mean, three?

2247
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:37,529
Challenge the game?

2248
01:53:37,529 --> 01:53:38,810
He already blitzed me.

2249
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:41,050
No, we cannot face him.

2250
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:44,810
I've made you weak, but not so stupid.

2251
01:53:45,689 --> 01:53:50,380
Choose me.

2252
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:53,189
I'm this guy.

2253
01:53:53,189 --> 01:53:54,069
Quickly.

2254
01:53:54,069 --> 01:53:56,659
Or he's destroyed.

2255
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,239
No.

2256
01:53:59,239 --> 01:54:01,000
I leaned in so close for that.

2257
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:02,600
I'm not a warrior.

2258
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:03,239
Choose me.

2259
01:54:03,239 --> 01:54:04,760
I'm a freak of nature.

2260
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:05,880
Choose me.

2261
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:08,520
She pulls up from down below the frame,

2262
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,840
an envelope with the fucking Smash logo on it.

2263
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:11,800
This isn't Karelia.

2264
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:12,840
You should run with the wolf.

2265
01:54:15,319 --> 01:54:15,960
Come with me.

2266
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,439
We can take this thing to Mexico right now.

2267
01:54:19,079 --> 01:54:20,520
Start a new life, a new show.

2268
01:54:21,079 --> 01:54:23,000
I'll touch objects, you look real moody.

2269
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:24,439
Why couldn't that work?

2270
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:25,960
He's been listening.

2271
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:31,689
She's in.

2272
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:40,789
If I'm so weak, why would they make me come in here again?

2273
01:54:40,789 --> 01:54:46,390
Like, he already won.

2274
01:54:46,390 --> 01:54:50,439
I think it's time for the powerful, psychic old lady to have a try.

2275
01:54:51,079 --> 01:54:52,949
But her excuse was,

2276
01:54:52,949 --> 01:54:56,470
No, no, you're weak and terrible, and you suck.

2277
01:54:57,350 --> 01:54:59,989
But you do it again.

2278
01:54:59,989 --> 01:55:13,659
That's all I got from that.

2279
01:55:13,659 --> 01:55:15,750
Same ending and coming.

2280
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:16,390
It can't be.

2281
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:25,109
It actually cannot be the same ending.

2282
01:55:25,109 --> 01:55:26,789
Seven hundred dollar console, by the way.

2283
01:55:26,789 --> 01:55:30,260
Omega Lola wasn't that much money.

2284
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:33,619
Although, like, I'll sell one to you if that's what you want to pay for it.

2285
01:55:33,619 --> 01:55:51,619
Karelia, so photogenic.

2286
01:55:51,619 --> 01:55:54,420
Why can't they all be full screen?

2287
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:56,840
Why does it have to be in the tiny little window?

2288
01:55:57,479 --> 01:56:00,069
This doesn't even look bad.

2289
01:56:00,069 --> 01:56:02,149
Why does it have to put it so small?

2290
01:56:02,869 --> 01:56:07,220
Trouble in the rat hole.

2291
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:08,710
Monica's up there.

2292
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:10,069
Top floor.

2293
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:13,220
What about Max?

2294
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:15,220
He's waiting for us to make a move.

2295
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:19,369
I guess you couldn't see the icons, huh?

2296
01:56:20,329 --> 01:56:21,449
Let's take him out.

2297
01:56:21,449 --> 01:56:22,899
I want to go.

2298
01:56:22,899 --> 01:56:23,539
Then go.

2299
01:56:23,539 --> 01:56:24,500
But I'm holding this.

2300
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:28,140
I'm not going to get the same ending.

2301
01:56:46,229 --> 01:56:48,229
Is this a great country or?

2302
01:56:48,229 --> 01:56:50,810
Mirage quest.

2303
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:51,930
What a scam.

2304
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:55,850
You know, only in America could someone declare war on depression.

2305
01:56:55,850 --> 01:56:58,010
Depression is very important to Karelians.

2306
01:56:58,010 --> 01:57:00,250
It makes all that boredom seem somehow.

2307
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:03,050
But did you say Karelians?

2308
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:03,850
What was Superman?

2309
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:05,130
A room full of sponge cake.

2310
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:06,810
Every crumb in love with Lexi.

2311
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:07,930
A humble beginning.

2312
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:08,649
To what end?

2313
01:57:09,289 --> 01:57:10,810
Good seats at the ballpark.

2314
01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:12,329
Plank steak whenever I want.

2315
01:57:12,329 --> 01:57:12,810
Krypton.

2316
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:14,409
Unlimited will wash your head.

2317
01:57:14,409 --> 01:57:14,890
What was he?

2318
01:57:14,890 --> 01:57:15,609
You're a mage.

2319
01:57:15,609 --> 01:57:18,170
Karelia on its knees.

2320
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:18,649
Klingon.

2321
01:57:18,649 --> 01:57:19,289
No, no, no, no.

2322
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:22,069
No, just a little.

2323
01:57:26,619 --> 01:57:27,979
So you've brought a toy.

2324
01:57:28,699 --> 01:57:29,579
You are prepared.

2325
01:57:29,579 --> 01:57:30,859
Superman was a Klingon.

2326
01:57:31,979 --> 01:57:32,539
Cold feet?

2327
01:57:33,590 --> 01:57:34,710
I'm not surprised.

2328
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:36,710
A Kryptonian?

2329
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:39,510
Hehehehehe.

2330
01:57:40,859 --> 01:57:42,220
Oh shit, this is getting weird.

2331
01:57:42,939 --> 01:57:56,840
Hehehehehe.

2332
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:59,609
This is how you do it.

2333
01:58:00,329 --> 01:58:02,170
No wasted motion.

2334
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:03,850
No parlor tricks.

2335
01:58:04,649 --> 01:58:06,170
Say goodbye to the girl.

2336
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:07,619
Go to the car.

2337
01:58:08,789 --> 01:58:09,510
No.

2338
01:58:09,510 --> 01:58:11,380
Harder.

2339
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:13,430
Don't you want to see her cry?

2340
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:14,970
Hey.

2341
01:58:14,970 --> 01:58:15,770
You think I need your help?

2342
01:58:16,489 --> 01:58:17,689
You think I want you watching me?

2343
01:58:17,689 --> 01:58:23,380
You're a cheerleader, a throw rug. Now move! Go!

2344
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:31,170
Good boy. That is good boy. Nobody wants to burn you.

2345
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:36,470
Just bring me the toy. These are the good times.

2346
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:39,479
Okay, hand it over.

2347
01:58:40,909 --> 01:58:42,220
It's a simple game, Rio.

2348
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:45,220
I don't want to play the game though, but I don't touch anything.

2349
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:52,579
I don't get it, how do I lose?

2350
01:58:52,579 --> 01:59:04,779
He is scared of the cat. That was a right call.

2351
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:13,010
Which ones are stronger?

2352
01:59:13,010 --> 01:59:15,010
Alright, so now we lose. We have to lose this.

2353
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:17,310
I don't want to accidentally win.

2354
01:59:17,310 --> 01:59:18,310
Alright, how about this one?

2355
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:23,680
Take the bracelet, the doll, and red square.

2356
01:59:23,680 --> 01:59:26,680
And then, I don't know, this guy.

2357
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:35,000
Okay, let's lose.

2358
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Okay, let's take the doll and put it over to cigarette.

2359
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:47,649
I can tell which hidden the little bogeyman that scares you in the dark.

2360
01:59:47,649 --> 01:59:51,649
He works with me now. He tells me all your secrets.

2361
01:59:51,649 --> 01:59:53,399
Okay.

2362
01:59:53,399 --> 01:59:55,399
You're a little burnt up, aren't you?

2363
01:59:55,399 --> 01:59:57,399
As if I needed a handicap.

2364
01:59:57,399 --> 02:00:02,560
Cigarette on two. Alright, that's two in a row.

2365
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,560
Terror feeds the gift. Terror makes you stronger.

2366
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:11,170
And lets me pull you apart.

2367
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:12,170
Not the same ending.

2368
02:00:12,170 --> 02:00:19,380
Okay, now we're going to do red square to lady, right?

2369
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:21,380
Doesn't she destroy red square?

2370
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:28,899
That one was particularly tasty.

2371
02:00:28,899 --> 02:00:30,899
The damn thing is rigged.

2372
02:00:30,899 --> 02:00:32,899
Well, take notes.

2373
02:00:32,899 --> 02:00:34,899
For some other lifetime.

2374
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:40,779
Okay, time to lose.

2375
02:00:40,779 --> 02:00:41,779
Game over.

2376
02:00:41,779 --> 02:00:53,869
Yep, that's me.

2377
02:00:53,869 --> 02:00:56,869
The babbling idiot and his new best friend.

2378
02:00:56,869 --> 02:00:59,739
I want deep down.

2379
02:00:59,739 --> 02:01:02,739
You're still a little part of me that's really smart.

2380
02:01:02,739 --> 02:01:05,420
That knows what's going on.

2381
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:06,420
Deep down.

2382
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:07,420
Just doesn't get out much.

2383
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:16,060
Did have that hair.

2384
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:23,560
Yeah, that was really not worth watching the whole like 26 minute movie again.

2385
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:27,760
To just say I want ice cream in jail.

2386
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:31,979
It was not worth it at all, actually.

2387
02:01:31,979 --> 02:01:32,979
Wasn't even the right one.

2388
02:01:32,979 --> 02:01:34,979
Yeah, it was. It's Moki's Playmate.

2389
02:01:34,979 --> 02:01:41,149
You get that by not doing anything.

2390
02:01:41,149 --> 02:01:42,149
Alright, let's move on.

2391
02:01:42,149 --> 02:01:46,100
That was a meaty one though. I knew that was going to take at least a couple hours.

2392
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:50,300
We're going to move on to...

2393
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:54,529
We're in the 3D, I might as well stay on it.

2394
02:01:54,529 --> 02:01:56,529
We're going to play a game called I'm Mercenary.

2395
02:01:56,529 --> 02:02:01,069
Fucking Christ, finally.

2396
02:02:01,069 --> 02:02:10,380
Hey. Hey, come on, man.

2397
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:12,380
Enemy Spider-Man? No, I'm Mercenary.

2398
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:16,350
It looks pretty bizarre, but let's...

2399
02:02:16,350 --> 02:02:18,350
You know, we'll take a break too.

2400
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:19,350
Just a quick one.

2401
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:21,680
Let's go pee.

2402
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:22,680
Grab a water.

2403
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:25,430
And I'll be back in two minutes.

2404
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:26,430
We're going to play I'm Mercenary.

2405
02:02:26,430 --> 02:02:28,569
In a sec.

2406
02:02:28,569 --> 02:06:11,060
Why are you all sleeping?

2407
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:15,140
Why are you all sleeping?

2408
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:18,020
Why are you all sleeping?

2409
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:22,239
Okay, I'm Mercenary.

2410
02:06:22,239 --> 02:06:30,300
Probably should change the title to just retro.

2411
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:34,420
Alright, let's go.

2412
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:44,939
I have no idea how good this...

2413
02:06:44,939 --> 02:06:46,939
This game might be a fucking dud.

2414
02:06:46,939 --> 02:06:50,140
It looks wild.

2415
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:51,960
So we'll find out.

2416
02:06:51,960 --> 02:07:01,369
A 3DO experience.

2417
02:07:01,369 --> 02:07:03,569
From Electro...

2418
02:07:03,569 --> 02:07:07,130
How much did EA have to do with this?

2419
02:07:07,130 --> 02:07:11,539
The games are exclusive EA games.

2420
02:07:11,539 --> 02:07:12,539
Did they make it?

2421
02:07:12,539 --> 02:07:14,539
Were they part of the process?

2422
02:07:14,539 --> 02:07:16,539
There's a lot of EA games.

2423
02:07:16,539 --> 02:07:17,539
Wake up.

2424
02:07:17,539 --> 02:07:30,239
Satellite Intercept.

2425
02:07:30,239 --> 02:07:31,239
Pick HQ.

2426
02:07:31,239 --> 02:07:34,529
Transmission.

2427
02:07:34,529 --> 02:07:41,739
This is in the sake of every generation to come.

2428
02:07:41,739 --> 02:07:44,979
Listen to me and behold your future.

2429
02:07:44,979 --> 02:07:48,979
After 10,000 years, I'm free.

2430
02:07:48,979 --> 02:07:51,979
It's time to conquer Earth.

2431
02:07:51,979 --> 02:07:55,600
Your children's children will become enslaved.

2432
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,970
Forced to fight each other to the death.

2433
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:00,970
Unless you listen to what I say.

2434
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:02,970
I know what must be done.

2435
02:08:02,970 --> 02:08:05,970
But I am powerless to act on my own.

2436
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:09,210
We must have a warrior from your time.

2437
02:08:09,210 --> 02:08:12,210
Someone outside this world we call perfect.

2438
02:08:12,210 --> 02:08:14,210
That person was just sleeping in a chair on the top left.

2439
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:25,000
And must send us a warrior to destroy perfect.

2440
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Can you scroll it a little slower?

2441
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:38,649
That's not me. That's not me.

2442
02:08:38,649 --> 02:08:48,119
Copyright 1995. You just took me out, man.

2443
02:08:48,119 --> 02:08:51,060
Leave the flatline thing there.

2444
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:52,060
You just pulled me out.

2445
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:57,119
New Jump.

2446
02:08:57,119 --> 02:09:01,319
Okay. All I can do is New Jump.

2447
02:09:01,319 --> 02:09:04,260
A211.

2448
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:05,260
Near Little Rock.

2449
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:06,500
Okay.

2450
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:13,859
One of the Ghostbusters?

2451
02:09:13,859 --> 02:09:33,899
Why do they all have syringes?

2452
02:09:33,899 --> 02:09:37,289
We've got to pull him out.

2453
02:09:37,289 --> 02:09:48,140
No! I thought it was going to shatter.

2454
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:55,539
That's actually what would happen if you got pulled out of the Matrix, by the way.

2455
02:09:55,539 --> 02:10:21,510
Help destruct?

2456
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:23,510
It's the guy.

2457
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:25,510
All these tales. Could it be?

2458
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:28,510
It's going to be that guy from the Unsolved Mysteries thing.

2459
02:10:28,510 --> 02:10:31,390
Some of these are fiction. Some of these are fact.

2460
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:33,390
Can you find out which one?

2461
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:36,909
In crazy stories.

2462
02:10:36,909 --> 02:10:46,260
This one. This one was real.

2463
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:48,260
I know. Real fucked up, I know.

2464
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:50,260
This is all we got from Thor.

2465
02:10:50,260 --> 02:11:05,149
Jonathan Breaks. Yes.

2466
02:11:05,149 --> 02:11:14,239
The day to analyze it quick.

2467
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:24,479
I don't think I want to go into that.

2468
02:11:24,479 --> 02:11:26,479
It's clearly just a dentist's chair.

2469
02:11:26,479 --> 02:11:28,850
No, it's a barber's chair.

2470
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:33,970
With a headband on it.

2471
02:11:33,970 --> 02:11:46,640
A gamer coffin.

2472
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:48,640
We haven't determined what happened yet.

2473
02:11:48,640 --> 02:11:51,199
But be careful in this area.

2474
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:53,500
This is where we lost contact with number four.

2475
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:57,500
Sorry, I think somebody may have hit the side of the TV with a hammer.

2476
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:59,500
I think they're ready whenever you are.

2477
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:01,500
So you can't really tell what the hell is going on here.

2478
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:05,340
Neither can I.

2479
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:07,340
Approaching synchronization now.

2480
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:09,970
Waveform sync.

2481
02:12:09,970 --> 02:12:12,270
Check. Interference pattern.

2482
02:12:12,270 --> 02:12:14,270
0.5 milliseconds.

2483
02:12:14,270 --> 02:12:16,270
Forward.

2484
02:12:16,270 --> 02:12:18,270
Going in. Ready to link.

2485
02:12:18,270 --> 02:12:20,270
Jump in. Three. Two.

2486
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:22,449
One. Let's go.

2487
02:12:22,449 --> 02:12:40,289
Are we in?

2488
02:12:40,289 --> 02:12:45,920
This is what it feels like to be in an MRI.

2489
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:48,989
What the hell is going on? Gamer?

2490
02:12:48,989 --> 02:12:56,220
This is not what I thought

2491
02:12:56,220 --> 02:12:58,220
this was going to be.

2492
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:00,220
Enter the playground.

2493
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:07,199
Falcon.

2494
02:13:07,199 --> 02:13:09,199
It really is just a game. It's just a video warning.

2495
02:13:09,199 --> 02:13:11,199
Low defense. Red spire required.

2496
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:13,819
Are these teammates?

2497
02:13:13,819 --> 02:13:24,560
Am I out of ammo?

2498
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:29,039
Dude, it's a battle royale.

2499
02:13:29,039 --> 02:13:31,729
Wait a minute. What am I going to go?

2500
02:13:39,010 --> 02:13:41,010
I spent all the money on the

2501
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:43,760
elaborate intro.

2502
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:47,539
Touch this? I just picked that person up.

2503
02:13:47,539 --> 02:13:51,760
I think we're capping the point.

2504
02:13:57,779 --> 02:14:02,000
What's this? D.

2505
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
O. A. What is that up there?

2506
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:10,779
I killed that person.

2507
02:14:10,779 --> 02:14:12,779
I'm rank 255.

2508
02:14:12,779 --> 02:14:17,710
I need to go find a red spire.

2509
02:14:17,710 --> 02:14:22,829
Okay. Let's go.

2510
02:14:22,829 --> 02:14:25,579
This is a blue spire. It's not what I want.

2511
02:14:25,579 --> 02:14:32,880
Red spire. Is it on the map?

2512
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,979
No. It's blue. Blue?

2513
02:14:36,979 --> 02:14:39,279
Also blue?

2514
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:43,699
I think I passed out.

2515
02:14:43,699 --> 02:14:46,380
Rank...

2516
02:14:56,380 --> 02:14:58,380
I don't know what he said.

2517
02:14:58,380 --> 02:15:00,380
This is the type of game that you would see in a

2518
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:02,819
Mountain Dew commercial.

2519
02:15:08,699 --> 02:15:10,699
It's like a game that you would see

2520
02:15:10,699 --> 02:15:12,699
on the background of a

2521
02:15:12,699 --> 02:15:14,699
TV show tries to show you what a

2522
02:15:14,699 --> 02:15:24,500
video game is.

2523
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:28,020
I'm going back in.

2524
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:30,020
Total jumps. Rank 255.

2525
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:32,770
Defense, offense, and agility.

2526
02:15:32,770 --> 02:15:34,770
Ammo algorithms.

2527
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:38,800
Agility is green.

2528
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,979
Offense is red.

2529
02:15:40,979 --> 02:15:42,979
Defense is yellow.

2530
02:15:42,979 --> 02:15:48,289
Effectiveness is 34%.

2531
02:15:48,289 --> 02:15:55,760
Let's jump.

2532
02:15:55,760 --> 02:16:00,560
Mountain Dew commercial.

2533
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:02,560
Would you be the test subject

2534
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:05,060
back in the mid-90s

2535
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:07,060
to play a game like that if you got to be

2536
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:09,869
in VR for like 10 minutes?

2537
02:16:09,869 --> 02:16:15,949
Let's see if I can figure this out.

2538
02:16:15,949 --> 02:16:17,949
That Mountain Dew commercial the whole time would be like

2539
02:16:17,949 --> 02:16:19,949
with two

2540
02:16:19,949 --> 02:16:21,949
top boxes you can level up.

2541
02:16:21,949 --> 02:16:26,880
If you send in five labels

2542
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,880
you'll get 200 XP

2543
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:35,540
points.

2544
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:38,159
Take your game to the next level.

2545
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:40,159
And the person has a huge fucking headset on.

2546
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:42,159
They always just have a gigantic headset on.

2547
02:16:42,159 --> 02:16:44,159
And they like put their hands in the air and they scream

2548
02:16:44,159 --> 02:16:50,819
yeah. Alright I'm in yellow right now.

2549
02:16:50,819 --> 02:16:52,819
Should I just hold it? Just hold this?

2550
02:16:52,819 --> 02:17:03,489
Red. The music's not bad.

2551
02:17:03,489 --> 02:17:07,520
No it's not. It's alright.

2552
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:16,979
Alright red. The bars are going up.

2553
02:17:16,979 --> 02:17:18,979
Okay I'm standing in the red. Is that

2554
02:17:18,979 --> 02:17:20,979
the red bar is going up?

2555
02:17:20,979 --> 02:17:28,139
That's offense right?

2556
02:17:28,139 --> 02:17:32,940
That guy's 256? Did they explain any of this?

2557
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:34,940
No no no. Somebody died in the chair.

2558
02:17:34,940 --> 02:17:36,940
Now I have to come in here and

2559
02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:38,940
dude this guy is

2560
02:17:38,940 --> 02:17:42,399
kicking the shit out of me.

2561
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:44,399
That guy just destroyed me. I didn't even get a chance.

2562
02:18:02,829 --> 02:18:04,829
So you guys just

2563
02:18:04,829 --> 02:18:06,829
got to see in real time the reason why I don't

2564
02:18:06,829 --> 02:18:08,829
play online multiplayer games anymore.

2565
02:18:08,829 --> 02:18:10,829
That's my experience.

2566
02:18:10,829 --> 02:18:15,250
I just got in. Okay I'm running around

2567
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:17,250
this corner. Oh I got hit hit hit hit

2568
02:18:17,250 --> 02:18:19,250
every single thing. I got

2569
02:18:19,250 --> 02:18:21,250
like triple tapped. I'm dead.

2570
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:23,250
Oh. Okay well

2571
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:25,250
I guess I'm going to start again. Oh I got

2572
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:27,250
hit in the air and then hit in the air and then

2573
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:30,450
juggled and hit in the air again.

2574
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:32,450
Alright I think it's going to open up Minecraft.

2575
02:18:32,450 --> 02:18:43,819
Let's jump again. Ammo algorithm.

2576
02:18:43,819 --> 02:18:52,139
Yeah I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.

2577
02:18:52,139 --> 02:18:54,959
That song sucks? Okay.

2578
02:18:54,959 --> 02:19:02,190
Keep moving. What happened?

2579
02:19:02,190 --> 02:19:05,200
I just killed the yellow.

2580
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:07,569
Okay just keep walking. It's blue.

2581
02:19:07,569 --> 02:19:10,379
What does blue do? Blue is making my

2582
02:19:10,379 --> 02:19:15,629
defense go up. And offense. Alright

2583
02:19:15,629 --> 02:19:25,100
keep moving. Go go go go go go. Don't stop.

2584
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:28,370
Good. Good. Alright keep going.

2585
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:31,379
Warning. Low agility. Rest for a while.

2586
02:19:31,379 --> 02:19:34,690
I have to stop. Low agility. Stop stop

2587
02:19:34,690 --> 02:19:37,700
stop stop. I'm stopped. I can only walk a

2588
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:39,700
certain distance. I get it. Okay.

2589
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:45,379
Get to a bonfire. Hold on.

2590
02:19:45,379 --> 02:19:47,940
What's this thing? Like an eye? I have to kill it?

2591
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:52,030
Touch it? High explosive area

2592
02:19:52,030 --> 02:19:54,030
effect ammo uses 10

2593
02:19:54,030 --> 02:19:56,030
units per blast.

2594
02:19:56,030 --> 02:20:04,399
Did I get it? I think I got it.

2595
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:09,950
Hold on. This is red. Rest for

2596
02:20:09,950 --> 02:20:18,020
a second. Run run run run run.

2597
02:20:18,020 --> 02:20:20,020
This is like blue's base. Pick that up. What is it?

2598
02:20:20,020 --> 02:20:25,500
I don't know. I didn't touch it. I just missed everything.

2599
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:27,500
I missed every single shot on that guy

2600
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:29,500
and he was like a level one scrub.

2601
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:38,209
Warning. Low agility. I know I know I know.

2602
02:20:38,209 --> 02:20:42,049
Stop stop stop stop.

2603
02:20:42,049 --> 02:20:44,049
Stop stop stop stop.

2604
02:20:44,049 --> 02:20:54,399
Shit. I'm gonna.

2605
02:20:54,399 --> 02:20:58,430
Come on dude. What the fuck.

2606
02:20:58,430 --> 02:21:02,780
When does my brain shut off?

2607
02:21:07,860 --> 02:21:09,860
That's what caused his algorithm to crash.

2608
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:12,930
I don't know. No.

2609
02:21:12,930 --> 02:21:14,930
I'm feeling there's more to it than that. Jim, I think

2610
02:21:14,930 --> 02:21:16,930
there's a little more to it. I think he's just not very good.

2611
02:21:16,930 --> 02:21:20,430
Here's your stats. Let us know

2612
02:21:20,430 --> 02:21:25,620
when. This guy lied on his resume.

2613
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:29,969
It says he was

2614
02:21:29,969 --> 02:21:31,969
he said he prestige three times

2615
02:21:31,969 --> 02:21:34,850
in Call of Duty Black Ops.

2616
02:21:34,850 --> 02:21:36,850
That's true. That doesn't mean

2617
02:21:36,850 --> 02:21:39,409
anything though. It just means he sat there

2618
02:21:39,409 --> 02:21:41,409
and just got experience over and over again.

2619
02:21:41,409 --> 02:21:43,409
This guy's not even good at anything.

2620
02:21:43,409 --> 02:21:45,409
You hired this guy on prestige alone?

2621
02:21:45,409 --> 02:21:47,409
You really fucked the whole thing up.

2622
02:21:47,409 --> 02:21:57,780
Didn't you Mike? Only on prestige

2623
02:21:57,780 --> 02:21:59,780
three. Prestige three. God damn it.

2624
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:03,170
You can sit in the corner of a lobby

2625
02:22:03,170 --> 02:22:05,170
and get to prestige 99 in

2626
02:22:05,170 --> 02:22:13,489
three months.

2627
02:22:13,489 --> 02:22:15,489
The Devil XP Mountain Dew.

2628
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:20,670
Look at how big this is.

2629
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:22,670
Yeah, we probably shouldn't have given him all those cans

2630
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:25,229
of Mountain Dew. What is this?

2631
02:22:25,229 --> 02:22:36,540
What did we just

2632
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:44,350
stumble upon?

2633
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:46,350
Do I get to select a unit?

2634
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:54,219
Wait a minute. This is cool.

2635
02:22:54,219 --> 02:23:03,170
I can talk? What who is

2636
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:05,409
where is? What who

2637
02:23:05,409 --> 02:23:09,299
is? What is P-Fect?

2638
02:23:09,299 --> 02:23:11,860
What is Pusher?

2639
02:23:11,860 --> 02:23:14,100
It knocks people out of

2640
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:17,739
your way. Where is

2641
02:23:17,739 --> 02:23:20,500
P-Fect? It's everywhere.

2642
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:22,500
You can't get away from it.

2643
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:26,059
Where is

2644
02:23:26,059 --> 02:23:28,059
Stunner? Wherever you find it

2645
02:23:28,059 --> 02:23:30,620
I guess. This is the shittiest eight ball

2646
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:32,799
I've ever shook in my whole life.

2647
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:39,139
There's all the same answer. Where reality

2648
02:23:39,139 --> 02:23:41,139
ends and the dream begins.

2649
02:23:41,139 --> 02:23:43,139
That was the slogan

2650
02:23:43,139 --> 02:23:45,139
they hit us with when they launched this thing.

2651
02:23:45,139 --> 02:23:47,139
A new frontier in

2652
02:23:47,139 --> 02:23:49,139
virtual reality they said.

2653
02:23:49,139 --> 02:23:51,139
What they didn't say was that this

2654
02:23:51,139 --> 02:23:54,270
is the final frontier.

2655
02:23:54,270 --> 02:23:56,770
Oh, well that's kind of cool. It's like Star Trek.

2656
02:23:56,770 --> 02:24:04,819
Okay, goodbye.

2657
02:24:04,819 --> 02:24:07,629
What do you have to say? Did I somehow

2658
02:24:07,629 --> 02:24:09,629
accidentally beat the game?

2659
02:24:09,629 --> 02:24:16,479
How do I get higher rank? What is the

2660
02:24:16,479 --> 02:24:18,479
Garden? What is Perfect One? What is

2661
02:24:18,479 --> 02:24:20,479
Ashflay? What is

2662
02:24:20,479 --> 02:24:22,479
Chafe? What is Boomerang?

2663
02:24:22,479 --> 02:24:24,719
What is a

2664
02:24:24,719 --> 02:24:26,719
Pems?

2665
02:24:26,719 --> 02:24:29,340
You just don't get it, do you?

2666
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:31,340
You're not going to get out of here alive

2667
02:24:31,340 --> 02:24:34,540
and ne- Was that actually Penis?

2668
02:24:34,540 --> 02:24:42,290
Was that like a how dare you don't ask me

2669
02:24:42,290 --> 02:24:45,739
that question? Nothing, really.

2670
02:24:45,739 --> 02:24:49,520
What is the Garden?

2671
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:51,889
The Garden is perfect.

2672
02:24:51,889 --> 02:24:53,889
And perfect is the Garden.

2673
02:24:53,889 --> 02:24:55,889
Where is the Garden?

2674
02:24:55,889 --> 02:24:58,190
Wherever we are.

2675
02:24:58,190 --> 02:25:01,569
That is the Garden. Where is Perfect

2676
02:25:01,569 --> 02:25:03,569
One? Perfect One

2677
02:25:03,569 --> 02:25:05,739
is dead. Oh.

2678
02:25:05,739 --> 02:25:09,180
Oh, no.

2679
02:25:09,180 --> 02:25:11,180
Who is Perfect One? A liar

2680
02:25:11,180 --> 02:25:13,920
and a lie. There is

2681
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:15,920
no Perfect One. So Perfect One is

2682
02:25:15,920 --> 02:25:19,250
dead, though. Where is Roberto?

2683
02:25:19,250 --> 02:25:21,549
Roberto is sixth in the hierarchy.

2684
02:25:21,549 --> 02:25:23,549
He's the crazy one.

2685
02:25:23,549 --> 02:25:25,979
Or maybe we're all

2686
02:25:25,979 --> 02:25:27,979
crazy and he's sane.

2687
02:25:27,979 --> 02:25:34,500
Goodbye. So, can I

2688
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:38,270
pick one of these? What

2689
02:25:38,270 --> 02:25:40,270
the fuck is that?

2690
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:43,409
What is this thing?

2691
02:25:43,409 --> 02:25:50,579
Like a fly?

2692
02:25:50,579 --> 02:25:52,579
I've been watching you.

2693
02:25:52,579 --> 02:25:55,069
I see

2694
02:25:55,069 --> 02:25:57,069
everything.

2695
02:25:57,069 --> 02:25:59,950
You know? Okay.

2696
02:25:59,950 --> 02:26:01,950
What is the

2697
02:26:01,950 --> 02:26:04,579
Garden? The Garden

2698
02:26:04,579 --> 02:26:06,579
is good.

2699
02:26:06,579 --> 02:26:08,579
Oh, I said what is the Garden?

2700
02:26:08,579 --> 02:26:10,579
Not how is

2701
02:26:10,579 --> 02:26:15,309
the Garden. What is

2702
02:26:15,309 --> 02:26:19,149
Perfect? It's everything

2703
02:26:19,149 --> 02:26:21,149
and nothing.

2704
02:26:21,149 --> 02:26:23,459
No, no. I didn't say why.

2705
02:26:23,459 --> 02:26:25,760
A computer program. A universe.

2706
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:28,059
A dream.

2707
02:26:28,059 --> 02:26:30,430
It's all we have.

2708
02:26:30,430 --> 02:26:35,620
Okay.

2709
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:37,790
Let's say where is the Garden?

2710
02:26:37,790 --> 02:26:39,790
There is nothing

2711
02:26:39,790 --> 02:26:41,790
but the Garden.

2712
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:44,479
Are these people in the computer? Are these people

2713
02:26:44,479 --> 02:26:46,479
with me in the game? Are these other gamers?

2714
02:26:46,479 --> 02:26:49,299
Is that like a cool

2715
02:26:49,299 --> 02:26:51,299
transmog this person has?

2716
02:26:51,299 --> 02:26:53,299
I don't understand. Are these other gamers?

2717
02:26:53,299 --> 02:27:03,069
Wait, hold on. This became

2718
02:27:03,069 --> 02:27:07,549
a completely different game.

2719
02:27:07,549 --> 02:27:09,549
Okay, who is

2720
02:27:09,549 --> 02:27:11,549
the Garden?

2721
02:27:11,549 --> 02:27:14,180
It's the same thing as Perfect.

2722
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:16,180
Okay, enough of this bullshit. What is it?

2723
02:27:16,180 --> 02:27:18,180
I don't know. A lot of people

2724
02:27:18,180 --> 02:27:20,180
have been killed around the East Residential

2725
02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:22,180
District lately though. Thank you for the info.

2726
02:27:22,180 --> 02:27:24,180
And no one's seen anything. What? Oh.

2727
02:27:24,180 --> 02:27:26,180
Makes you wonder.

2728
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:28,180
Okay.

2729
02:27:28,180 --> 02:27:30,180
What is a cannibal?

2730
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:32,180
It increases your offensive capabilities.

2731
02:27:32,180 --> 02:27:38,000
Okay, goodbye. Alright, which one should I touch?

2732
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,940
Should I touch the Five Head?

2733
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:45,489
Oh, that person's naked.

2734
02:27:45,489 --> 02:27:51,250
I can't activate any of these

2735
02:27:51,250 --> 02:28:00,079
things? Okay, I'm just going to leave.

2736
02:28:00,079 --> 02:28:09,360
The Prophecy of Porn Week

2737
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:11,920
is true.

2738
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:13,920
The door seize is neutral.

2739
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:15,920
Enter to heal. Oh, shit.

2740
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:20,020
Oh, they're trying to go into heal.

2741
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:22,020
Should I just camp and wait

2742
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:24,450
for them all to come out?

2743
02:28:24,450 --> 02:28:26,450
Yeah.

2744
02:28:26,450 --> 02:28:28,450
Jim, he's using his tried and true

2745
02:28:28,450 --> 02:28:30,450
tactic of Call of Duty XP

2746
02:28:30,450 --> 02:28:32,450
boosting. This is how he got his prestige.

2747
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:34,450
I told you this guy was the real deal.

2748
02:28:34,450 --> 02:28:43,780
He's spawn camping.

2749
02:28:43,780 --> 02:28:49,540
He got me right in the fucking head. And when he finds a good

2750
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:53,950
player, he runs the fuck away. Let's heal.

2751
02:28:53,950 --> 02:28:56,450
Find a red spire.

2752
02:28:56,450 --> 02:28:58,450
Wait, there are new players here. There are people here again.

2753
02:28:58,450 --> 02:29:00,450
This really is just

2754
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:02,450
like, okay. Wait.

2755
02:29:02,450 --> 02:29:05,139
I want to talk to this guy. This is other

2756
02:29:05,139 --> 02:29:15,299
players.

2757
02:29:15,299 --> 02:29:17,469
Where is Ice?

2758
02:29:17,469 --> 02:29:19,899
If you think you can handle Tesla,

2759
02:29:19,899 --> 02:29:21,899
try looking around the power plant.

2760
02:29:21,899 --> 02:29:26,700
What is perfect one?

2761
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:28,700
The ultimate virtual warrior.

2762
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:30,700
He's never been defeated in combat

2763
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:32,700
and he's been here since the beginning.

2764
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:35,329
The perfect one is the rank

2765
02:29:35,329 --> 02:29:38,340
one. Where are they?

2766
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:40,340
The spire.

2767
02:29:40,340 --> 02:29:46,530
The spire. Okay.

2768
02:29:46,530 --> 02:29:48,530
This person hit a hundred times on character

2769
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:53,520
generator. Okay. Well,

2770
02:29:53,520 --> 02:30:01,200
what the hell is this? What is

2771
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:04,059
he? A grenade

2772
02:30:04,059 --> 02:30:10,079
more or less.

2773
02:30:10,079 --> 02:30:12,079
This is like Dr. Manhattan's friend.

2774
02:30:12,079 --> 02:30:16,620
Dr. Charcoal.

2775
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:23,340
A stun gun. It's a stunner.

2776
02:30:23,340 --> 02:30:25,340
I don't know where in the real world.

2777
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:27,340
I entered in Palo Alto.

2778
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:29,840
You can make the jump

2779
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:31,840
anywhere in the country. At least

2780
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:33,840
you used to be able to. I have no

2781
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:35,840
idea what's happening on the outside.

2782
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:41,540
This is a side hang. That was a lie.

2783
02:30:41,540 --> 02:30:43,540
I don't know where in the real world.

2784
02:30:43,540 --> 02:30:45,540
I entered in Palo Alto.

2785
02:30:45,540 --> 02:30:48,030
You can make the jump anywhere

2786
02:30:48,030 --> 02:30:50,030
in the country. At least

2787
02:30:50,030 --> 02:30:52,030
you used to be able to. I have no

2788
02:30:52,030 --> 02:30:54,030
idea what's happening on the outside

2789
02:30:54,030 --> 02:30:57,229
anymore. This, somebody just said this

2790
02:30:57,229 --> 02:30:59,229
would have been really cool to play back then. Yeah.

2791
02:30:59,229 --> 02:31:02,750
It would have. I mean, nowadays

2792
02:31:02,750 --> 02:31:04,750
not so much, but still

2793
02:31:04,750 --> 02:31:10,000
is pretty interesting.

2794
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,780
Character generator. Okay.

2795
02:31:13,780 --> 02:31:15,780
Somebody said to go to the east side.

2796
02:31:15,780 --> 02:31:20,129
Why do we all have to fight each other out here?

2797
02:31:20,129 --> 02:31:27,860
Oh shit.

2798
02:31:27,860 --> 02:31:30,670
Okay. I'm gonna go

2799
02:31:30,670 --> 02:31:32,670
I'm gonna run away. Let's go over here.

2800
02:31:32,670 --> 02:31:35,100
There's a building I can go over here.

2801
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:37,100
Can I go in here? I think I might be able to go in this.

2802
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:44,899
Alright, slow down.

2803
02:31:44,899 --> 02:31:48,030
Can I go in this?

2804
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:51,809
Enter the pyramid. To face

2805
02:31:51,809 --> 02:31:54,370
Medusa. I wasn't ready

2806
02:31:54,370 --> 02:32:02,049
to face Medusa?

2807
02:32:02,049 --> 02:32:10,930
Uh oh.

2808
02:32:10,930 --> 02:32:14,579
Uh oh.

2809
02:32:14,579 --> 02:32:16,579
This is gonna be this.

2810
02:32:16,579 --> 02:32:18,579
Shit. Watch out. I'm gonna go this way.

2811
02:32:18,579 --> 02:32:31,809
Where is she? Agility

2812
02:32:31,809 --> 02:32:33,809
is bad. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2813
02:32:33,809 --> 02:32:38,159
Is she gonna wrap around me right?

2814
02:32:38,159 --> 02:32:41,420
My offense is not terrible.

2815
02:32:41,420 --> 02:32:43,420
My defense is so bad though.

2816
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:49,629
I'm gonna spam as fast as I can when I see her.

2817
02:32:49,629 --> 02:32:54,430
It's gonna be like

2818
02:32:54,430 --> 02:32:59,420
Oh shit.

2819
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:04,850
What happens if I win?

2820
02:33:04,850 --> 02:33:06,850
She's rank 11. I'm about to be a 255

2821
02:33:06,850 --> 02:33:08,850
versus an 11. If I win I get to 10.

2822
02:33:08,850 --> 02:33:26,959
I just got one shot.

2823
02:33:49,329 --> 02:33:51,329
Run through the fields?

2824
02:33:51,329 --> 02:33:54,899
Run through the fields?

2825
02:33:54,899 --> 02:33:57,899
Wait, I'm supposed to be

2826
02:33:57,899 --> 02:33:59,899
dying?

2827
02:33:59,899 --> 02:34:01,899
I'm supposed to die

2828
02:34:01,899 --> 02:34:03,899
and run through the field

2829
02:34:03,899 --> 02:34:05,899
and stuff. Okay.

2830
02:34:05,899 --> 02:34:07,899
Get more power.

2831
02:34:07,899 --> 02:34:09,899
I lost agility and lost

2832
02:34:09,899 --> 02:34:11,899
D.

2833
02:34:11,899 --> 02:34:17,790
I'm supposed to die

2834
02:34:17,790 --> 02:34:19,790
and run through the field and stuff.

2835
02:34:19,790 --> 02:34:21,790
Okay.

2836
02:34:21,790 --> 02:34:23,790
Get more power.

2837
02:34:23,790 --> 02:34:25,790
I lost agility and lost defense.

2838
02:34:25,790 --> 02:34:28,479
Alright, we gotta run through a static

2839
02:34:28,479 --> 02:34:32,319
field. What the hell does a static

2840
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:41,010
field look like?

2841
02:34:41,010 --> 02:34:43,010
Kill enemies, collect their static.

2842
02:34:43,010 --> 02:34:45,309
Now start and select to return to the lab.

2843
02:34:45,309 --> 02:34:52,340
Okay.

2844
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:57,389
Okay, I got static. I get it.

2845
02:34:57,389 --> 02:34:59,760
Alright, cool. Did I touch that?

2846
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:02,639
Weird pool ball. High power, long range

2847
02:35:02,639 --> 02:35:04,639
blaster uses three zero units.

2848
02:35:04,639 --> 02:35:07,329
Alright, so I think I collected that.

2849
02:35:07,329 --> 02:35:09,329
Low agility, rest for a while. So what if

2850
02:35:09,329 --> 02:35:11,569
I press start? Select ammo.

2851
02:35:11,569 --> 02:35:13,940
Oh shit, look at this.

2852
02:35:13,940 --> 02:35:18,350
Default, default. What's this one?

2853
02:35:18,350 --> 02:35:22,239
Select ammo.

2854
02:35:22,239 --> 02:35:24,239
Give all messages. Information

2855
02:35:24,239 --> 02:35:26,239
only. Warnings only.

2856
02:35:26,239 --> 02:35:35,780
Okay, let's go back. Select.

2857
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:38,659
No, I can't do it yet, I don't think.

2858
02:35:38,659 --> 02:35:43,579
I get it. Okay.

2859
02:35:43,579 --> 02:35:47,620
Alright, so

2860
02:35:47,620 --> 02:35:49,620
there, I'm level 255. I have to

2861
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:51,620
only kill 255s.

2862
02:35:51,620 --> 02:35:57,629
Do they just keep me in here overnight?

2863
02:35:57,629 --> 02:36:08,129
You're a prisoner.

2864
02:36:08,129 --> 02:36:15,549
I don't think I'm a prisoner.

2865
02:36:15,549 --> 02:36:19,649
Alright, let me try this a couple more times.

2866
02:36:19,649 --> 02:36:21,649
So I have to run around and kill a bunch of things that are my level.

2867
02:36:21,649 --> 02:36:23,649
So we're only looking for

2868
02:36:23,649 --> 02:36:26,079
shitty players. Avoid everybody

2869
02:36:26,079 --> 02:36:30,239
else. Burn messages back on.

2870
02:36:30,239 --> 02:36:39,579
Okay. Pointing, low defense.

2871
02:36:39,579 --> 02:36:43,979
Give me that static. I need, I'm already

2872
02:36:43,979 --> 02:36:50,899
dead. Static.

2873
02:36:50,899 --> 02:36:58,299
Okay. Static.

2874
02:36:58,299 --> 02:37:01,489
Static. Okay, now what?

2875
02:37:01,489 --> 02:37:06,739
Select ammo. How do I get out? How do I do?

2876
02:37:06,739 --> 02:37:11,409
Should we be strafing? There's no strafing.

2877
02:37:11,409 --> 02:37:17,229
There's so many

2878
02:37:17,229 --> 02:37:26,059
people over here.

2879
02:37:28,059 --> 02:37:30,500
Can you give me a flamethrower

2880
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:32,500
or something?

2881
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:41,649
What's this game called? It's called

2882
02:37:41,649 --> 02:37:43,649
iMercenary.

2883
02:37:43,649 --> 02:37:46,590
Alright, I keep losing shit

2884
02:37:46,590 --> 02:37:53,309
permanently. Okay, if I run around

2885
02:37:53,309 --> 02:37:55,309
fast, I run out of agility

2886
02:37:55,309 --> 02:37:57,309
and the game says stop moving. And when I stop moving

2887
02:37:57,309 --> 02:37:59,309
a guy 50 levels higher

2888
02:37:59,309 --> 02:38:01,309
than me shoots me in the head and kills me.

2889
02:38:01,309 --> 02:38:11,170
It's like a new map. Alright, static.

2890
02:38:11,170 --> 02:38:25,680
Damn it. I don't have any

2891
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:27,680
ammo. Alright, I'm done.

2892
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:29,680
I'm done moving on.

2893
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:33,709
New game.

2894
02:38:33,709 --> 02:38:35,709
This is ridiculous.

2895
02:38:37,709 --> 02:38:39,709
No, it wasn't. I didn't kill anybody.

2896
02:38:42,530 --> 02:38:44,530
Stop gaslighting me because I'm the only fucking

2897
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:46,530
person that signed up for this experiment for $40.

2898
02:38:54,909 --> 02:38:58,819
Alright, last one, last one, last one.

2899
02:38:58,819 --> 02:39:08,420
One more. Stop gaslighting the word

2900
02:39:08,420 --> 02:39:11,549
gaslighting.

2901
02:39:11,549 --> 02:39:13,920
I feel like the word has feeling.

2902
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:15,920
Alright, I gotta at least do something interesting.

2903
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:17,920
Alright.

2904
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:19,920
Shit is so low. Look at how big that bar can be.

2905
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:24,659
The fuck, dude?

2906
02:39:24,659 --> 02:39:26,659
Where am I supposed to go?

2907
02:39:26,659 --> 02:39:34,510
What do you have to say now?

2908
02:39:34,510 --> 02:39:40,270
Nothing. It doesn't have anything to say.

2909
02:39:46,270 --> 02:39:48,270
In fact, I think, I think they may have, I don't think very many

2910
02:39:48,270 --> 02:39:54,219
people still work here. That guy might be

2911
02:39:54,219 --> 02:40:01,389
the janitor for all I know.

2912
02:40:01,389 --> 02:40:03,389
Run from spire to spire. Alright, that's what I'm gonna do.

2913
02:40:03,389 --> 02:40:08,700
Just stay near

2914
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:11,899
the pyre. You need to kill

2915
02:40:11,899 --> 02:40:13,899
higher rank than two of these. Alright, I'm just gonna go

2916
02:40:13,899 --> 02:40:17,540
fire.

2917
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:19,540
Okay, cool. I just, if I stay still I'm gonna die.

2918
02:40:22,479 --> 02:40:24,479
Why is my chili so bad?

2919
02:40:24,479 --> 02:40:26,479
I can only walk for two seconds.

2920
02:40:26,479 --> 02:40:32,879
What's the point of having traffic

2921
02:40:32,879 --> 02:40:36,399
lights? Stop, stop, stop, stop.

2922
02:40:36,399 --> 02:40:48,690
It's so slow.

2923
02:40:48,690 --> 02:40:55,340
I'm softlocked. No, don't put me back

2924
02:40:55,340 --> 02:40:57,340
in. Can I please eat

2925
02:40:57,340 --> 02:41:15,260
something?

2926
02:41:15,260 --> 02:41:17,260
I think we ran out of FMV sequences.

2927
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:19,260
So, we're just gonna get the basic

2928
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:25,469
ones. Alright, when I kill

2929
02:41:25,469 --> 02:41:27,469
the green guys, do I get green

2930
02:41:27,469 --> 02:41:40,020
stuff? Alright, I can almost make it to the blue.

2931
02:41:40,020 --> 02:41:42,020
I'm almost there. Low agility.

2932
02:41:42,020 --> 02:41:46,559
I think I just died

2933
02:41:46,559 --> 02:41:48,559
from being too tired. Alright, that's it. I'm out. Pull me

2934
02:41:48,559 --> 02:41:52,020
out. Pull me out. I'm done.

2935
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:54,260
That's it. I've done it.

2936
02:42:16,290 --> 02:42:18,290
This is German Pluto.

2937
02:42:20,290 --> 02:42:22,530
...capture those static algorithms.

2938
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:24,530
Permanently add their power to your projection

2939
02:42:24,530 --> 02:42:26,530
into perfect. Get to the point.

2940
02:42:26,530 --> 02:42:29,149
The rhythms you can crash into in Huffman,

2941
02:42:29,149 --> 02:42:31,149
the more powerful you'll become.

2942
02:42:31,149 --> 02:42:33,389
The better your chances

2943
02:42:33,389 --> 02:42:35,389
of attaining our mission objective.

2944
02:42:35,389 --> 02:42:37,569
Gain all the power you can this

2945
02:42:37,569 --> 02:42:39,870
way. Why didn't you tell me

2946
02:42:39,870 --> 02:42:41,870
this? Like

2947
02:42:41,870 --> 02:42:43,870
18 days ago

2948
02:42:43,870 --> 02:42:46,940
when I got into the machine.

2949
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:48,940
Wasn't somebody in this before? Somebody

2950
02:42:48,940 --> 02:42:50,940
died in this thing. You don't think they had the data

2951
02:42:50,940 --> 02:42:56,579
before? Alright, one more.

2952
02:42:56,579 --> 02:42:58,579
One more. This is it. And then I'm done.

2953
02:42:58,579 --> 02:43:00,940
This is it. Last one. This is the actual

2954
02:43:00,940 --> 02:43:07,409
final one. This is the last one.

2955
02:43:07,409 --> 02:43:22,620
This is it. I promise.

2956
02:43:22,620 --> 02:43:28,049
Agility done. No more ammo.

2957
02:43:28,049 --> 02:43:30,049
Okay, fuck it, I'm out. Take me out.

2958
02:43:30,049 --> 02:43:32,930
I love this game. Don't stop.

2959
02:43:32,930 --> 02:43:39,520
Run into the static fields.

2960
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:41,520
I died. Nobody even shot me.

2961
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:43,520
Nobody shot me. I've run out of lives.

2962
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:45,700
I've gotta go. Okay.

2963
02:43:45,700 --> 02:43:52,860
It's time to move on.

2964
02:43:52,860 --> 02:43:55,100
I don't even care anymore.

2965
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:57,100
I'm just being tortured in here.

2966
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:03,120
Can you at least just wake me up

2967
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:05,120
and just give me a Red Bull? I feel like I

2968
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:07,120
would have a little bit more opportunity to succeed.

2969
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:10,000
Stop just waking me up and putting

2970
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:20,049
me back to sleep, dude.

2971
02:44:20,049 --> 02:44:24,780
Restart the game.

2972
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:28,989
We're gonna play another one. What do I wanna do now?

2973
02:44:28,989 --> 02:44:30,989
Here comes a mystery. You have no idea what it's gonna

2974
02:44:30,989 --> 02:44:32,989
be, but it's gonna be a mystery. Well, you know.

2975
02:44:32,989 --> 02:46:21,010
Give me one sec. Okay.

2976
02:46:21,010 --> 02:46:23,010
So this one coming up here

2977
02:46:23,010 --> 02:46:25,010
is completely in Japanese.

2978
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:27,950
I have no idea what's gonna happen here,

2979
02:46:27,950 --> 02:46:29,950
but this is called Montana Jones.

2980
02:46:29,950 --> 02:46:33,469
You're gonna have to help me out here.

2981
02:46:33,469 --> 02:46:35,469
Out of this, probably about 6,000 people

2982
02:46:35,469 --> 02:46:37,469
or one of you know how to speak Japanese.

2983
02:46:37,469 --> 02:46:58,829
Somebody will.

2984
02:46:58,829 --> 02:47:07,219
It's a cat, Indiana Jones.

2985
02:47:07,219 --> 02:47:12,399
Wait a minute.

2986
02:47:12,399 --> 02:47:14,399
This is Wacky Racers.

2987
02:47:14,399 --> 02:47:17,579
Same company.

2988
02:47:17,579 --> 02:47:27,760
Now I'm excited.

2989
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:29,760
Because Wacky Racers was awesome.

2990
02:47:40,899 --> 02:47:49,469
Nice.

2991
02:47:49,469 --> 02:47:58,239
Montana Jones.

2992
02:47:58,239 --> 02:48:21,969
Fully animated?

2993
02:48:21,969 --> 02:48:23,969
He was like facetiming like a grand

2994
02:48:23,969 --> 02:48:26,209
kid. Making funny faces.

2995
02:48:26,209 --> 02:48:31,010
But Zelda CD-i

2996
02:48:31,010 --> 02:48:33,010
is not. It's better than that.

2997
02:48:33,010 --> 02:48:44,270
Okay, Montana?

2998
02:48:44,270 --> 02:48:46,450
Alfred or Melissa?

2999
02:48:46,450 --> 02:48:55,149
Give me the gist of it. Give me the gist of it.

3000
02:48:55,149 --> 02:49:13,629
Give me the gist. What did you say?

3001
02:49:13,629 --> 02:49:17,709
I can't select anybody.

3002
02:49:17,709 --> 02:49:19,889
What the fuck was that?

3003
02:49:19,889 --> 02:49:24,219
Did I take too long?

3004
02:49:24,219 --> 02:49:26,219
Alright, where are we gonna go? San Francisco?

3005
02:49:26,219 --> 02:49:28,219
The Caribbean Sea?

3006
02:49:28,219 --> 02:49:30,219
Through England, Egypt,

3007
02:49:30,219 --> 02:49:32,219
Tibet, or Sofet?

3008
02:49:32,219 --> 02:49:36,620
Sofet.

3009
02:49:36,620 --> 02:49:38,620
San Francisco or

3010
02:49:38,620 --> 02:49:45,149
Sofafet? Let's go San Francisco.

3011
02:49:45,149 --> 02:49:54,940
Oh, you know what it probably was like? This message will

3012
02:49:54,940 --> 02:49:56,940
self-destruct in 10 seconds, right?

3013
02:49:56,940 --> 02:50:10,129
I got that part.

3014
02:50:10,129 --> 02:50:14,420
Now what? It keeps floating.

3015
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:26,299
Okay.

3016
02:50:26,299 --> 02:50:28,299
We're landing.

3017
02:50:28,299 --> 02:50:30,610
Landing in San

3018
02:50:30,610 --> 02:50:32,610
Francisco. We're gonna try to get a diamond.

3019
02:50:34,610 --> 02:50:42,350
San Francisco.

3020
02:50:52,780 --> 02:50:55,149
What are we looking for?

3021
02:50:55,149 --> 02:50:57,149
What are we looking for? What are we looking for?

3022
02:50:57,149 --> 02:51:04,750
This way. We're trying to do

3023
02:51:04,750 --> 02:51:07,569
this way.

3024
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:15,020
We'll take a firework, please.

3025
02:51:15,020 --> 02:51:17,020
I guess.

3026
02:51:19,329 --> 02:51:21,329
Okay.

3027
02:51:21,329 --> 02:51:28,159
Okay.

3028
02:51:28,159 --> 02:51:30,159
Now what?

3029
02:51:34,129 --> 02:51:37,520
I guess we'll take one. Is it puzzle time?

3030
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:41,520
Oh shit, I don't even know what the puzzle is.

3031
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:43,700
What is the puzzle?

3032
02:51:43,700 --> 02:51:47,340
I took the first one.

3033
02:51:47,340 --> 02:51:49,340
You never take the first one.

3034
02:51:57,459 --> 02:51:59,459
It's okay. If I can't read it, then it won't come true.

3035
02:51:59,459 --> 02:52:02,659
I don't know. If I can't read it,

3036
02:52:02,659 --> 02:52:04,659
if I can't comprehend it, can't understand it, it's not gonna come true. It won't be real.

3037
02:52:10,799 --> 02:52:15,979
Friends like that. What does it say?

3038
02:52:21,870 --> 02:52:23,870
Is that cursed?

3039
02:52:23,870 --> 02:52:31,469
Okay. What about in the

3040
02:52:31,469 --> 02:52:33,899
in here? Down the street?

3041
02:52:33,899 --> 02:52:43,700
Let's go in here.

3042
02:52:43,700 --> 02:52:49,520
Expensive vases?

3043
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,520
Are we stealing something from here?

3044
02:52:51,520 --> 02:52:57,729
I don't understand. Steel?

3045
02:52:57,729 --> 02:53:02,340
Are we taking something?

3046
02:53:02,340 --> 02:53:07,329
Vases? Lamps?

3047
02:53:07,329 --> 02:53:09,629
Jewelry or something?

3048
02:53:09,629 --> 02:53:12,959
Should we go in here?

3049
02:53:14,959 --> 02:53:16,959
Yes.

3050
02:53:16,959 --> 02:53:18,959
This is Zero-kyo.

3051
02:53:18,959 --> 02:53:20,959
We are friends.

3052
02:53:20,959 --> 02:53:22,959
Don't desecrate one of the areas. I didn't do anything.

3053
02:53:22,959 --> 02:53:26,420
What are you talking about?

3054
02:53:26,420 --> 02:53:28,420
Shut up and pretend to be Zero-kyo.

3055
02:53:32,510 --> 02:53:34,510
This is Zero-kyo.

3056
02:53:34,510 --> 02:53:36,510
Is he angry?

3057
02:53:38,510 --> 02:53:40,510
He's like, come on over here.

3058
02:53:40,510 --> 02:53:42,510
Come here.

3059
02:53:42,510 --> 02:53:46,909
He says here.

3060
02:53:46,909 --> 02:53:49,409
Please translate for me.

3061
02:53:50,409 --> 02:53:58,969
Is it here?

3062
02:54:00,969 --> 02:54:02,969
I'm trying, but you aren't reading my messages.

3063
02:54:02,969 --> 02:54:04,969
Alright, I'm gonna read your messages from now on.

3064
02:54:04,969 --> 02:54:09,700
Sir, Sir Linkerton.

3065
02:54:09,700 --> 02:54:14,379
Sir Linkerton, please.

3066
02:54:14,379 --> 02:54:19,559
Help me.

3067
02:54:24,500 --> 02:54:25,500
Why, where they come from?

3068
02:54:25,500 --> 02:54:27,500
That many people could fit on that?

3069
02:54:27,500 --> 02:54:30,639
Where are they coming from?

3070
02:54:36,639 --> 02:54:38,639
Am I about to make a deal?

3071
02:54:40,639 --> 02:54:42,639
Linkerton, what's going on here?

3072
02:54:42,639 --> 02:54:45,329
He said welcome.

3073
02:54:45,329 --> 02:54:47,329
He said a little more than welcome.

3074
02:54:47,329 --> 02:54:51,299
Did I pick that up?

3075
02:54:51,299 --> 02:54:56,420
Okay, what did he say?

3076
02:54:56,420 --> 02:55:05,620
We just took him.

3077
02:55:05,620 --> 02:55:07,620
Were we supposed to?

3078
02:55:10,370 --> 02:55:12,370
Two minutes of dialogue.

3079
02:55:12,370 --> 02:55:14,370
I'm getting destroyed.

3080
02:55:14,370 --> 02:55:16,989
I'm getting destroyed.

3081
02:55:20,989 --> 02:55:25,469
Did you bring the money?

3082
02:55:25,469 --> 02:55:27,780
I don't think we have any money.

3083
02:55:31,780 --> 02:55:33,780
I found this guy snooping around upstairs.

3084
02:55:36,079 --> 02:55:38,079
Bring him.

3085
02:55:38,079 --> 02:55:40,079
Oh no.

3086
02:55:40,079 --> 02:55:42,079
Stay calm everybody.

3087
02:55:42,079 --> 02:55:56,020
We don't know what he's planning.

3088
02:55:56,020 --> 02:55:58,020
This became a different video game.

3089
02:55:58,020 --> 02:56:09,329
Five nights at Freddy's.

3090
02:56:13,329 --> 02:56:15,329
Should we leave?

3091
02:56:15,329 --> 02:56:17,329
Alright, I need a translation.

3092
02:56:17,329 --> 02:56:20,139
What is she saying?

3093
02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:27,120
What's this room?

3094
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:34,479
What's this room?

3095
02:56:43,299 --> 02:56:45,299
I need to break my neck, she says.

3096
02:56:45,299 --> 02:56:47,299
That's not what she said.

3097
02:56:47,299 --> 02:56:50,430
Alright, what did he say?

3098
02:56:50,430 --> 02:56:53,059
What did Linkerton say?

3099
02:56:53,059 --> 02:56:55,549
That's the only person I'm listening to.

3100
02:56:55,549 --> 02:56:57,549
What should we do? What's this room?

3101
02:57:03,360 --> 02:57:05,360
Need a key.

3102
02:57:08,930 --> 02:57:12,059
He said next game.

3103
02:57:12,059 --> 02:57:14,059
I'm sure she did.

3104
02:57:25,739 --> 02:57:27,739
Every room is the same.

3105
02:57:27,739 --> 02:57:35,979
Every room is the same.

3106
02:57:37,979 --> 02:57:39,979
He said this video fucking sucks laughing my ass off.

3107
02:57:41,979 --> 02:57:43,979
He says you moron, you are going the wrong way.

3108
02:57:56,350 --> 02:57:58,350
Does anybody have any idea what's going on?

3109
02:58:02,530 --> 02:58:04,530
He might be saying you need a paper.

3110
02:58:06,700 --> 02:58:08,700
You need a paper.

3111
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:11,329
Shit.

3112
02:58:11,329 --> 02:58:14,270
I need a paper.

3113
02:58:14,270 --> 02:58:29,760
He said play wacky braces.

3114
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:36,930
Come on.

3115
02:58:36,930 --> 02:58:40,059
Toilet paper.

3116
02:58:40,059 --> 02:58:42,930
Stop.

3117
02:58:42,930 --> 02:58:44,930
We can't help you go through the maze.

3118
02:58:44,930 --> 02:58:48,450
It's all the same room.

3119
02:58:48,450 --> 02:58:57,020
I have to memorize what I clicked on.

3120
02:58:57,020 --> 02:59:14,219
Shit.

3121
02:59:14,219 --> 02:59:19,540
Get me out of here.

3122
02:59:19,540 --> 02:59:22,540
I'm finally out of here.

3123
02:59:22,540 --> 02:59:23,500
I took back the

3124
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:25,500
Bannereck's Tojiki from the gang.

3125
02:59:25,500 --> 02:59:27,500
And it's a big success.

3126
02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:34,020
Get in there.

3127
02:59:34,020 --> 02:59:36,020
We made it out.

3128
02:59:36,020 --> 02:59:39,409
Nice work.

3129
02:59:39,409 --> 02:59:41,409
It's too early to be at ease.

3130
02:59:41,409 --> 02:59:43,409
Come on, come on, let's go.

3131
02:59:43,409 --> 02:59:45,409
Wait up, you little brats.

3132
02:59:52,110 --> 02:59:56,110
Manic Dragon, height 5'2, weight 3'2.

3133
02:59:57,069 --> 03:00:05,969
What is the trouble?

3134
03:00:05,969 --> 03:00:13,579
Why am I looking at this?

3135
03:00:13,579 --> 03:00:17,920
Am I going to ride it?

3136
03:00:17,920 --> 03:00:23,299
How many games are there?

3137
03:00:23,299 --> 03:00:26,879
I didn't mean to do that.

3138
03:00:26,879 --> 03:00:28,879
This whole thing was made in dreams, by the way.

3139
03:00:28,879 --> 03:00:30,879
Life?

3140
03:00:30,879 --> 03:00:37,149
Why is my life a fuel gauge?

3141
03:00:37,149 --> 03:00:41,629
How about his head?

3142
03:00:41,629 --> 03:00:44,579
That didn't work?

3143
03:00:44,579 --> 03:00:46,579
Why is there a timer?

3144
03:00:46,579 --> 03:00:57,309
Get up.

3145
03:00:57,309 --> 03:01:06,399
Don't get hit again.

3146
03:01:06,399 --> 03:01:12,799
I just have to avoid it.

3147
03:01:14,579 --> 03:01:17,520
Easy.

3148
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:19,520
Wait, secret.

3149
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:21,950
Oh, I did it.

3150
03:01:21,950 --> 03:01:27,379
Let's go.

3151
03:01:27,379 --> 03:01:29,379
Go where?

3152
03:01:29,379 --> 03:01:31,549
You can run into the walls?

3153
03:01:31,549 --> 03:01:37,809
Why can you do that?

3154
03:01:37,809 --> 03:01:40,180
I'm not...

3155
03:01:40,180 --> 03:01:54,260
It's getting...

3156
03:01:54,260 --> 03:01:56,260
It's going so fast.

3157
03:01:56,260 --> 03:02:01,309
You have no idea.

3158
03:02:01,309 --> 03:02:03,309
Okay, well, San Francisco apparently has been destroyed.

3159
03:02:03,309 --> 03:02:06,639
I don't know.

3160
03:02:06,639 --> 03:02:25,950
How about England?

3161
03:02:25,950 --> 03:02:28,319
I am way more interested in this game now.

3162
03:02:28,319 --> 03:02:30,559
Because of the...

3163
03:02:30,559 --> 03:02:44,829
Eight different game modes that exist.

3164
03:02:44,829 --> 03:02:56,290
Translator, ready?

3165
03:02:56,290 --> 03:02:58,290
Lost in England.

3166
03:03:02,290 --> 03:03:08,430
This boomer unironically enjoys shit.

3167
03:03:17,809 --> 03:03:19,809
Is this an anime made into a game?

3168
03:03:19,809 --> 03:03:26,530
I don't know.

3169
03:03:26,530 --> 03:03:31,389
Maybe...

3170
03:03:31,389 --> 03:03:33,389
Okay, so we've got cars.

3171
03:03:37,569 --> 03:03:40,700
It is.

3172
03:03:40,700 --> 03:03:43,010
Oh, no. Translator.

3173
03:03:43,010 --> 03:03:47,940
What was just said?

3174
03:03:47,940 --> 03:03:57,340
I feel like this is important.

3175
03:03:57,340 --> 03:04:01,569
Where's my translator?

3176
03:04:01,569 --> 03:04:06,670
My chat's going too fast.

3177
03:04:06,670 --> 03:04:08,670
Should you change your name to Fart?

3178
03:04:08,670 --> 03:04:11,299
I can't even...

3179
03:04:11,299 --> 03:04:13,299
That's so dumb.

3180
03:04:13,299 --> 03:04:17,329
Why did I read what you said?

3181
03:04:17,329 --> 03:04:21,040
It asks you to go back to Boston.

3182
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:26,159
No, it didn't.

3183
03:04:26,159 --> 03:04:28,159
It asks if you want to use the car or the taxi.

3184
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:30,159
But that's not a yes or a no.

3185
03:04:30,159 --> 03:04:32,159
Do you want to use the car or the taxi?

3186
03:04:32,159 --> 03:04:40,989
Yes.

3187
03:04:40,989 --> 03:04:42,989
Oh, dear God.

3188
03:04:47,739 --> 03:04:55,360
Do I have access to brakes?

3189
03:04:55,360 --> 03:05:00,930
Or speed?

3190
03:05:00,930 --> 03:05:04,319
We're going very slow.

3191
03:05:04,319 --> 03:05:06,319
By the way, you're driving on this side of the road, right?

3192
03:05:06,319 --> 03:05:17,969
You have to drive on the left side.

3193
03:05:17,969 --> 03:05:21,870
I can't do anything.

3194
03:05:21,870 --> 03:05:24,879
Let's get to full letter grade.

3195
03:05:24,879 --> 03:05:35,379
Technically, that's true.

3196
03:05:35,379 --> 03:05:37,379
We're going five miles per hour.

3197
03:05:37,379 --> 03:05:49,659
It's okay.

3198
03:05:49,659 --> 03:05:51,659
I tried to side swipe him, but it went fine.

3199
03:06:20,659 --> 03:06:22,659
We made it.

3200
03:06:25,979 --> 03:06:29,889
Looks like we're taking the taxi.

3201
03:06:29,889 --> 03:06:31,889
Where are you off to?

3202
03:06:31,889 --> 03:06:37,059
I don't know.

3203
03:06:37,059 --> 03:06:39,420
That's Glastonbury Hill.

3204
03:06:39,420 --> 03:06:41,790
It's a beautiful place.

3205
03:06:41,790 --> 03:06:45,790
That makes sense because we definitely didn't drive more than 300 feet away from that way the taxi was.

3206
03:06:45,790 --> 03:06:48,290
There's an Excalibur somewhere in this church.

3207
03:06:48,290 --> 03:06:50,290
We barely pulled out of the driveway.

3208
03:06:50,290 --> 03:06:58,290
Let's go in.

3209
03:06:58,290 --> 03:07:00,290
There's an Excalibur somewhere in this maze.

3210
03:07:00,290 --> 03:07:13,280
Okay, time for another guess which way to go.

3211
03:07:13,280 --> 03:07:17,059
I can't get any help from anybody.

3212
03:07:17,059 --> 03:07:25,360
I need help.

3213
03:07:25,360 --> 03:07:31,489
They won't help me.

3214
03:07:31,489 --> 03:07:34,500
Touch it.

3215
03:07:34,500 --> 03:07:37,569
What did you say?

3216
03:07:37,569 --> 03:07:39,569
Did she say don't touch that or touch it?

3217
03:07:39,569 --> 03:07:44,670
Friends later.

3218
03:07:44,670 --> 03:07:46,670
Holy shit man, Montana's dumpy.

3219
03:07:52,370 --> 03:07:57,360
Now that opened this.

3220
03:08:06,260 --> 03:08:08,260
That's the way that your dog looks at you.

3221
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:10,260
When you're talking to them.

3222
03:08:10,260 --> 03:08:12,260
I'm a dog and I heard my name.

3223
03:08:14,260 --> 03:08:29,469
Can we do it?

3224
03:08:29,469 --> 03:08:35,040
Another one of these.

3225
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:40,930
Right next to the...

3226
03:08:40,930 --> 03:08:44,129
There's another one back here, right?

3227
03:08:44,129 --> 03:08:50,579
Down here.

3228
03:08:50,579 --> 03:08:52,750
Pull this one.

3229
03:08:52,750 --> 03:08:55,500
That should open up the one behind us.

3230
03:08:55,500 --> 03:09:02,610
Theoretically, right?

3231
03:09:02,610 --> 03:09:10,610
Then we turn left.

3232
03:09:10,610 --> 03:09:17,709
Should I...

3233
03:09:17,709 --> 03:09:19,709
That's probably that one.

3234
03:09:19,709 --> 03:09:23,549
This game predates the Bible.

3235
03:09:23,549 --> 03:09:26,739
I don't know.

3236
03:09:26,739 --> 03:09:33,649
Probably not.

3237
03:09:33,649 --> 03:09:36,079
Straight ahead.

3238
03:09:36,079 --> 03:09:38,079
This one might do this door.

3239
03:09:38,079 --> 03:09:46,700
I hope.

3240
03:09:46,700 --> 03:09:48,700
Next? No, no, no.

3241
03:09:48,700 --> 03:09:52,030
I don't want to say that right now.

3242
03:09:52,030 --> 03:09:54,030
You really don't want to say that.

3243
03:09:54,030 --> 03:10:00,370
That's not what you want.

3244
03:10:00,370 --> 03:10:05,809
I'll take the sword.

3245
03:10:05,809 --> 03:10:07,809
These Excalibur?

3246
03:10:11,709 --> 03:10:14,659
That means I'm the chosen one.

3247
03:10:14,659 --> 03:10:22,270
I'm the chosen one.

3248
03:10:22,270 --> 03:10:29,569
Boss fight with the sword?

3249
03:10:29,569 --> 03:10:32,059
That would be awesome.

3250
03:10:32,059 --> 03:10:37,120
Mechanic mole.

3251
03:10:39,809 --> 03:10:41,809
You can't wield Excalibur if you're not chosen.

3252
03:10:41,809 --> 03:10:43,809
Doesn't it burn your hands?

3253
03:10:43,809 --> 03:10:53,219
Pennsylvania?

3254
03:11:02,350 --> 03:11:04,530
Can I use the sword for anything?

3255
03:11:04,530 --> 03:11:08,299
This is Super Mario shit here.

3256
03:11:08,299 --> 03:11:17,780
Look at these blocks.

3257
03:11:17,780 --> 03:11:24,110
Okay, I'm fine.

3258
03:11:24,110 --> 03:11:33,700
Shit, I gotta go down.

3259
03:11:33,700 --> 03:11:36,579
Don't blow this.

3260
03:11:36,579 --> 03:11:51,549
It gets progressively faster.

3261
03:11:51,549 --> 03:11:56,610
We're good, we're good.

3262
03:11:56,610 --> 03:11:58,610
Oh no, that's more of this shit.

3263
03:11:58,610 --> 03:12:03,520
I just took a brick to the head.

3264
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:14,020
All right, easy, easy, easy.

3265
03:12:14,020 --> 03:12:16,579
I have to beat one of these levels at least.

3266
03:12:16,579 --> 03:12:22,909
Shit, come on.

3267
03:12:22,909 --> 03:12:28,979
That's bullshit.

3268
03:12:28,979 --> 03:12:30,979
If you get touched by a brick, you go all the way back to the beginning?

3269
03:12:30,979 --> 03:12:36,930
That's stupid brick checkpoints.

3270
03:12:36,930 --> 03:12:53,120
Who the fuck are you?

3271
03:12:53,120 --> 03:12:55,620
Wait, who's that?

3272
03:12:55,620 --> 03:13:01,420
Don't get hit by a brick.

3273
03:13:01,420 --> 03:13:12,479
All right, easy.

3274
03:13:12,479 --> 03:13:16,559
Don't move.

3275
03:13:16,559 --> 03:13:27,870
You tell me I was that far away.

3276
03:13:27,870 --> 03:13:29,870
Think of this game like an ass.

3277
03:13:29,870 --> 03:13:32,239
And pretend to eat it.

3278
03:13:32,239 --> 03:13:34,239
All right, ban that person for at least 30 minutes.

3279
03:13:34,239 --> 03:13:46,459
There's more of this. There's probably three.

3280
03:13:46,459 --> 03:13:56,319
Good to know that that guy is now a part of the encounter.

3281
03:13:56,319 --> 03:14:00,479
Just stay up top.

3282
03:14:00,479 --> 03:14:12,370
Why give me such an opportunity to not get hit?

3283
03:14:12,370 --> 03:14:14,370
Oh, give me a fucking break.

3284
03:14:14,370 --> 03:14:18,079
That was stupid.

3285
03:14:18,079 --> 03:14:27,659
I won.

3286
03:14:27,659 --> 03:14:29,840
I don't have the sword.

3287
03:14:29,840 --> 03:14:33,940
I think it's just cutscene only.

3288
03:14:39,940 --> 03:14:41,940
I said, what did we do to deserve this punishment?

3289
03:14:41,940 --> 03:14:43,940
You guys didn't do anything.

3290
03:14:43,940 --> 03:14:46,940
I'm gonna need some time to fix this.

3291
03:14:46,940 --> 03:14:48,940
Welcome back.

3292
03:14:48,940 --> 03:14:51,440
You got the legendary sword, Excalibur.

3293
03:14:51,440 --> 03:14:56,879
I immediately killed Mogura with Excalibur.

3294
03:14:56,879 --> 03:15:06,219
Please stop playing the 3DO.

3295
03:15:06,219 --> 03:15:08,219
No, dude.

3296
03:15:08,219 --> 03:15:10,219
What do you mean?

3297
03:15:10,219 --> 03:15:12,459
Stop.

3298
03:15:12,459 --> 03:15:14,459
I'm gonna beat you up.

3299
03:15:14,459 --> 03:15:17,020
I'm gonna beat you up.

3300
03:15:17,020 --> 03:15:19,020
I'm gonna beat you up.

3301
03:15:19,020 --> 03:15:25,100
I'm gonna beat you up.

3302
03:15:25,100 --> 03:15:28,610
I'm gonna beat you up.

3303
03:15:28,610 --> 03:15:30,610
I'm gonna beat you up.

3304
03:15:30,610 --> 03:15:32,610
I'm gonna beat you up.

3305
03:15:32,610 --> 03:15:39,579
I'm gonna beat you up.

3306
03:15:39,579 --> 03:15:41,579
I'm gonna beat you up.

3307
03:15:41,579 --> 03:15:43,760
I'm gonna beat you up.

3308
03:15:43,760 --> 03:15:45,760
I'm gonna beat you up.

3309
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:48,639
I'm gonna beat you up.

3310
03:15:48,639 --> 03:15:56,829
I'm gonna beat you up.

3311
03:15:56,829 --> 03:15:59,899
I'm gonna beat you up.

3312
03:15:59,899 --> 03:16:01,899
I'm gonna beat you up.

3313
03:16:01,899 --> 03:16:16,370
I'm gonna beat you up.

3314
03:16:16,370 --> 03:16:22,450
I'm gonna beat you up.

3315
03:16:22,450 --> 03:16:24,450
I'm gonna beat you up.

3316
03:16:24,450 --> 03:16:26,450
I'm gonna beat you up.

3317
03:16:26,450 --> 03:16:35,979
I'm gonna beat you up.

3318
03:16:35,979 --> 03:16:39,950
I'm gonna beat you up.

3319
03:16:39,950 --> 03:16:41,950
I'm gonna beat you up.

3320
03:16:41,950 --> 03:16:44,700
I'm gonna beat you up.

3321
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,700
I'm gonna beat you up.

3322
03:16:46,700 --> 03:16:48,700
I'm gonna beat you up.

3323
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:50,700
I'm gonna beat you up.

3324
03:16:50,700 --> 03:16:52,700
I'm gonna beat you up.

3325
03:16:52,700 --> 03:16:56,860
I'm gonna beat you up.

3326
03:16:56,860 --> 03:17:00,319
I'm gonna beat you up.

3327
03:17:00,319 --> 03:17:08,379
I'm gonna beat you up.

3328
03:17:08,379 --> 03:17:10,379
I'm gonna beat you up.

3329
03:17:12,379 --> 03:17:16,540
I'm gonna beat you up.

3330
03:17:16,540 --> 03:17:19,620
I'm gonna beat you up.

3331
03:17:19,620 --> 03:17:24,159
I'm gonna beat you up.

3332
03:17:24,159 --> 03:17:26,159
I'm gonna beat you up.

3333
03:17:26,159 --> 03:17:28,909
I'm gonna beat you up.

3334
03:17:28,909 --> 03:17:31,409
I'm gonna beat you up.

3335
03:17:31,409 --> 03:17:33,409
I'm gonna beat you up.

3336
03:17:33,409 --> 03:17:39,809
I'm gonna beat you up.

3337
03:17:39,809 --> 03:17:41,809
I'm gonna beat you up.

3338
03:17:41,809 --> 03:17:44,299
I'm gonna beat you up.

3339
03:17:44,299 --> 03:17:50,049
I'm gonna beat you up.

3340
03:17:50,049 --> 03:17:52,049
I'm gonna beat you up.

3341
03:17:52,049 --> 03:17:54,049
It's not just a background.

3342
03:17:54,049 --> 03:17:56,049
It's also a foreground. I get it.

3343
03:18:05,819 --> 03:18:10,420
No!

3344
03:18:10,420 --> 03:18:12,590
Hooray!

3345
03:18:12,590 --> 03:18:18,459
I don't think I did that.

3346
03:18:18,459 --> 03:18:20,959
I need to get back up on there.

3347
03:18:20,959 --> 03:18:22,959
Where the fuck am I?

3348
03:18:32,530 --> 03:18:34,530
I can go through to the

3349
03:18:34,530 --> 03:18:36,530
background, background.

3350
03:18:36,530 --> 03:18:38,530
But not the background, background, background.

3351
03:18:38,530 --> 03:18:43,260
What's up there? Okay.

3352
03:18:43,260 --> 03:18:55,600
Shit! Did he touch me?

3353
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:57,600
Fuel gauge? I don't know. I'm probably made out of

3354
03:18:57,600 --> 03:19:02,340
metal or something.

3355
03:19:02,340 --> 03:19:04,340
I just want to play Sonic.

3356
03:19:04,340 --> 03:19:07,920
Should I grab the chain?

3357
03:19:07,920 --> 03:19:17,819
I'm gonna hand him this.

3358
03:19:17,819 --> 03:19:19,819
Is there a...

3359
03:19:19,819 --> 03:19:21,819
I need my translator.

3360
03:19:21,819 --> 03:19:37,569
What does that say? Lusiary wall?

3361
03:19:37,569 --> 03:19:45,309
Are we jumping out the window?

3362
03:19:45,309 --> 03:19:47,309
Well, he's here.

3363
03:19:49,309 --> 03:19:54,559
He said jump.

3364
03:19:54,559 --> 03:19:58,829
Jump. Okay.

3365
03:19:58,829 --> 03:20:01,010
I'm gonna jump.

3366
03:20:07,389 --> 03:20:09,760
That was risky.

3367
03:20:15,629 --> 03:20:18,829
That was pretty good clear.

3368
03:20:18,829 --> 03:20:24,209
I like that one.

3369
03:20:24,209 --> 03:20:30,659
Did he fall?

3370
03:20:33,709 --> 03:20:35,709
He said bite the disc and play Doki Doki Literature Club.

3371
03:20:35,709 --> 03:20:37,709
Okay, sure.

3372
03:20:37,709 --> 03:20:39,709
I bet you that's what was said.

3373
03:20:49,120 --> 03:20:56,030
We're home free, right?

3374
03:20:56,030 --> 03:20:58,030
We got the good thing we needed.

3375
03:21:00,030 --> 03:21:02,590
Horse?

3376
03:21:02,590 --> 03:21:04,590
Or horse.

3377
03:21:06,590 --> 03:21:10,430
It's a bear.

3378
03:21:16,430 --> 03:21:19,040
What are the wheels for?

3379
03:21:19,040 --> 03:21:21,040
Do you really put aesthetic wheels

3380
03:21:21,040 --> 03:21:23,040
on the back of the...

3381
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:25,040
and turn into a car?

3382
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:29,040
You're killing us.

3383
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:34,930
You're killing us.

3384
03:21:34,930 --> 03:21:37,940
Why am I killing you?

3385
03:21:37,940 --> 03:21:40,370
Hey, hey, hey.

3386
03:21:40,370 --> 03:21:43,440
You're choking me.

3387
03:21:43,440 --> 03:21:45,440
Get your hands off your own neck

3388
03:21:45,440 --> 03:21:47,440
and pretending it's me.

3389
03:21:47,440 --> 03:21:49,440
Go, go, go.

3390
03:21:49,440 --> 03:21:58,530
It's gonna fall.

3391
03:21:58,530 --> 03:22:08,559
Oldest trick in the book.

3392
03:22:08,559 --> 03:22:10,559
You are personally squeezing my brain juice out.

3393
03:22:16,559 --> 03:22:18,559
If that's the case,

3394
03:22:18,559 --> 03:22:20,559
the whole world will know I'm Zayac.

3395
03:22:20,559 --> 03:22:22,930
You guys!

3396
03:22:22,930 --> 03:22:24,930
Don't think this is over!

3397
03:22:24,930 --> 03:22:31,969
This is better than the first game?

3398
03:22:31,969 --> 03:22:34,459
No, it's not.

3399
03:22:34,459 --> 03:22:36,459
They're both equally good.

3400
03:22:36,459 --> 03:22:39,920
Welcome back.

3401
03:22:39,920 --> 03:22:41,920
I was a little worried.

3402
03:22:41,920 --> 03:22:44,479
Have you forgotten

3403
03:22:44,479 --> 03:22:46,479
that I'm the luckiest man in the world?

3404
03:22:46,479 --> 03:22:48,479
I would love to be killed by you.

3405
03:22:50,479 --> 03:22:52,479
Not by the weird

3406
03:22:52,479 --> 03:22:54,780
I-kill-you fantasy.

3407
03:22:54,780 --> 03:22:56,780
I already made that video. You can go watch it right now.

3408
03:22:56,780 --> 03:22:58,780
You can go pull up the green screen right now

3409
03:22:58,780 --> 03:23:00,780
and just sit there and be like...

3410
03:23:00,780 --> 03:23:09,420
You can sit there and watch the ASMR

3411
03:23:09,420 --> 03:23:14,860
murder you video.

3412
03:23:14,860 --> 03:23:17,229
Alright, this was funny.

3413
03:23:17,229 --> 03:23:25,090
It was fun. What's next?

3414
03:23:25,090 --> 03:23:27,090
You said...

3415
03:23:27,090 --> 03:23:29,090
Yeah, that's what I just said.

3416
03:23:29,090 --> 03:23:35,420
This one's over.

3417
03:23:35,420 --> 03:23:37,420
It's been three and a half hours.

3418
03:23:37,420 --> 03:23:39,420
I don't want to really

3419
03:23:39,420 --> 03:23:42,299
pivot to anything else right now.

3420
03:23:42,299 --> 03:23:44,299
I think we're going to clean this up

3421
03:23:44,299 --> 03:23:47,569
with a really good one.

3422
03:23:47,569 --> 03:23:49,569
The one that's coming up next is called

3423
03:23:49,569 --> 03:23:51,569
Way of the Warrior.

3424
03:23:51,569 --> 03:23:53,569
It is a full on green screen

3425
03:23:53,569 --> 03:23:55,569
real people in like costumes

3426
03:23:55,569 --> 03:24:02,350
fighting game.

3427
03:24:02,350 --> 03:24:04,350
This is where we're going to end it tonight.

3428
03:24:04,350 --> 03:24:06,979
We're going to pick that up. We're going to try it out.

3429
03:24:06,979 --> 03:24:15,170
It is an actual costume fighting game.

3430
03:24:15,170 --> 03:24:22,139
Give me one second.

3431
03:24:22,139 --> 03:24:24,139
I didn't even know what that image was.

3432
03:24:24,139 --> 03:24:26,139
I just saw that there was an image loaded into OBS.

3433
03:24:26,139 --> 03:24:28,139
I didn't want to blind you with those bars.

3434
03:24:28,139 --> 03:24:36,590
Let's put it up whatever it was.

3435
03:24:36,590 --> 03:24:38,590
Head to head fighting action.

3436
03:24:38,590 --> 03:24:40,590
Huge digitized characters.

3437
03:24:40,590 --> 03:24:42,590
60 to 80 moves per character.

3438
03:24:42,590 --> 03:24:50,340
And secrets to die for.

3439
03:24:50,340 --> 03:24:56,340
You've got my attention.

3440
03:24:56,340 --> 03:24:58,340
This is one of Naughty Dog's earliest games.

3441
03:24:58,340 --> 03:25:00,700
Is that really what this is?

3442
03:25:00,700 --> 03:25:04,159
Holy fuck, you're right. I didn't know that.

3443
03:25:04,159 --> 03:25:06,159
This is Naughty Dog's first game.

3444
03:25:06,159 --> 03:25:12,610
That's pretty cool.

3445
03:25:12,610 --> 03:25:18,370
Here's some gamer history for you here.

3446
03:25:18,370 --> 03:25:33,340
You're right.

3447
03:25:33,340 --> 03:25:36,420
How does it feel like I look like this guy?

3448
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:49,469
Sometimes.

3449
03:25:49,469 --> 03:25:53,440
Music by White Zombie.

3450
03:25:53,440 --> 03:26:04,000
Real band, huh?

3451
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:09,760
Way of the Warrior.

3452
03:26:09,760 --> 03:26:11,760
Thanks for using my subpar translating skills.

3453
03:26:11,760 --> 03:26:16,940
Hey, you were the one guy today.

3454
03:26:28,379 --> 03:26:30,379
I already love it.

3455
03:26:36,379 --> 03:26:59,200
This is like comedy mortal combat.

3456
03:26:59,200 --> 03:27:01,200
Or is this supposed to be taken seriously?

3457
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:03,200
I don't know yet.

3458
03:27:03,200 --> 03:27:05,200
Mortal combat is already kind of like comedy mortal combat, isn't it?

3459
03:27:05,200 --> 03:27:10,370
Find the way.

3460
03:27:10,370 --> 03:27:12,370
CDI Genon?

3461
03:27:12,370 --> 03:27:14,370
Okay, here we go.

3462
03:27:14,370 --> 03:27:16,370
The fighting has but one empty page.

3463
03:27:16,370 --> 03:27:18,370
And it is written that the way of this tournament's winner

3464
03:27:18,370 --> 03:27:20,370
will fill this page,

3465
03:27:20,370 --> 03:27:22,370
finish the book, and tip the scales

3466
03:27:22,370 --> 03:27:24,370
in favor of good or evil for eternity.

3467
03:27:24,370 --> 03:27:26,370
The balance of the world will lay

3468
03:27:26,370 --> 03:27:28,370
in the hands of everyone.

3469
03:27:28,370 --> 03:27:30,370
Find the way, noble challenger.

3470
03:27:30,370 --> 03:27:32,370
Find the way of the warrior.

3471
03:27:32,370 --> 03:27:35,379
CDI Genon?

3472
03:27:35,379 --> 03:27:39,219
Okay, here we go.

3473
03:27:39,219 --> 03:27:44,850
Game? Arena? I can't...

3474
03:27:44,850 --> 03:27:46,850
No, game.

3475
03:27:46,850 --> 03:27:48,850
Arena? Names?

3476
03:27:48,850 --> 03:27:53,250
No name.

3477
03:27:53,250 --> 03:27:55,250
No name. Skill.

3478
03:27:55,250 --> 03:27:57,250
Whatever, let's just go.

3479
03:27:57,250 --> 03:28:00,639
Let's go to just game.

3480
03:28:00,639 --> 03:28:06,399
Jakey, Jake,

3481
03:28:06,399 --> 03:28:08,399
Dragon, Australia,

3482
03:28:08,399 --> 03:28:10,399
Hong,

3483
03:28:10,399 --> 03:28:16,530
Jitsu,

3484
03:28:16,530 --> 03:28:18,770
Bar, brawling?

3485
03:28:18,770 --> 03:28:22,540
That's high.

3486
03:28:22,540 --> 03:28:26,260
Style.

3487
03:28:26,260 --> 03:28:28,260
Military UK.

3488
03:28:28,260 --> 03:28:32,159
I kind of want...wait, what about you?

3489
03:28:32,159 --> 03:28:34,340
Style? Original.

3490
03:28:34,340 --> 03:28:36,340
What is original style?

3491
03:28:36,340 --> 03:28:48,100
Jakey, Jake?

3492
03:28:48,100 --> 03:28:52,959
Alright, let's do it.

3493
03:28:52,959 --> 03:28:56,290
Alright, I'm going to say Muay Thai France.

3494
03:28:56,290 --> 03:28:58,530
I want to do Muay Thai.

3495
03:28:58,530 --> 03:29:03,579
Oh, I need a second controller.

3496
03:29:03,579 --> 03:29:05,760
Uh oh, wait.

3497
03:29:05,760 --> 03:29:12,860
I don't want to hear any more exposition from this skull.

3498
03:29:12,860 --> 03:29:19,069
You already did this.

3499
03:29:19,069 --> 03:29:30,459
The graveyard.

3500
03:29:30,459 --> 03:29:33,020
The throne room.

3501
03:29:33,020 --> 03:29:35,649
The temple.

3502
03:29:35,649 --> 03:29:38,459
The pit. Alright, the pit.

3503
03:29:38,459 --> 03:29:40,459
Alright, the game is

3504
03:29:40,459 --> 03:29:42,459
demo mode? Tournament mode.

3505
03:29:42,459 --> 03:29:44,459
Okay, we're going to do

3506
03:29:44,459 --> 03:29:46,770
tournament mode

3507
03:29:46,770 --> 03:29:48,940
at the pit. Right?

3508
03:29:48,940 --> 03:29:55,139
Are we ready?

3509
03:29:55,139 --> 03:30:07,739
There we go. Alright.

3510
03:30:07,739 --> 03:30:14,209
Look at those skulls.

3511
03:30:22,209 --> 03:30:24,899
Those are secret characters.

3512
03:30:24,899 --> 03:30:33,020
Are they really?

3513
03:30:33,020 --> 03:30:35,020
Blue man, Jax, and scorpion.

3514
03:30:35,020 --> 03:30:40,770
Here we go.

3515
03:30:40,770 --> 03:30:45,440
Wait, he grows?

3516
03:30:45,440 --> 03:30:56,770
Alright, that's a dog. Does it block?

3517
03:31:01,569 --> 03:31:12,129
Is there a move list?

3518
03:31:12,129 --> 03:31:15,260
Wait, no.

3519
03:31:15,260 --> 03:31:17,260
Stop.

3520
03:31:17,260 --> 03:31:19,500
Can I do moves?

3521
03:31:19,500 --> 03:31:35,500
How did he do that?

3522
03:31:35,500 --> 03:31:38,700
Sonic the Hedgehog.

3523
03:31:38,700 --> 03:31:40,700
Come on.

3524
03:31:40,700 --> 03:31:42,700
Dude, this is hard as shit.

3525
03:31:42,700 --> 03:31:57,659
Rematch. Come on.

3526
03:31:57,659 --> 03:31:59,659
Alright, that's upper punch.

3527
03:31:59,659 --> 03:32:06,639
Lower punch.

3528
03:32:06,639 --> 03:32:08,639
I'm trying to do like forward, down, forward,

3529
03:32:08,639 --> 03:32:10,639
C. Down, forward, C. Down, back,

3530
03:32:10,639 --> 03:32:16,340
C. I

3531
03:32:16,340 --> 03:32:18,770
used the combo.

3532
03:32:18,770 --> 03:32:21,709
I didn't even do a move.

3533
03:32:21,709 --> 03:32:25,170
Hold on a minute.

3534
03:32:25,170 --> 03:32:29,520
I need the instructions.

3535
03:32:29,520 --> 03:32:34,829
Okay, it says

3536
03:32:34,829 --> 03:32:36,829
special moves, nine, page nine.

3537
03:32:36,829 --> 03:32:41,120
Special moves.

3538
03:32:41,120 --> 03:32:43,120
In order to perform a special move,

3539
03:32:43,120 --> 03:32:45,120
you need to develop some special button technique.

3540
03:32:45,120 --> 03:32:47,120
First, it is important to remember that forward and back

3541
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:49,120
refer to the direction of the character. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3542
03:32:49,120 --> 03:32:51,120
Sweep attack. First down, then

3543
03:32:51,120 --> 03:32:53,120
down, forward, then down, forward.

3544
03:32:53,120 --> 03:32:55,120
What? Press D-pad

3545
03:32:55,120 --> 03:32:57,120
down, then press D-pad down, forward,

3546
03:32:57,120 --> 03:32:59,120
then press D-pad forward.

3547
03:32:59,120 --> 03:33:02,829
What the fuck are you talking about?

3548
03:33:02,829 --> 03:33:08,139
Down, down, forward,

3549
03:33:08,139 --> 03:33:11,219
down.

3550
03:33:11,219 --> 03:33:13,219
Skill points and magic.

3551
03:33:13,219 --> 03:33:18,719
Push the D-pad to the back and hold for two seconds.

3552
03:33:18,719 --> 03:33:20,719
Okay, cool.

3553
03:33:20,719 --> 03:33:22,719
Hold B button and press D-pad.

3554
03:33:22,719 --> 03:33:27,379
Alright, here we go.

3555
03:33:27,379 --> 03:33:29,379
Special moves. Perform a sweep move, then press

3556
03:33:29,379 --> 03:33:32,000
the left shift.

3557
03:33:32,000 --> 03:33:34,000
Press D-pad down, diagonally, then press down, diagonally,

3558
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:36,000
D-pad down.

3559
03:33:36,000 --> 03:33:38,000
I have

3560
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:43,120
whatever.

3561
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:49,709
D-pad down, then D-pad down,

3562
03:33:49,709 --> 03:33:53,940
forward, then D-pad down.

3563
03:33:53,940 --> 03:33:55,940
I'm gonna win. D-pad down, then D-pad down, forward,

3564
03:33:55,940 --> 03:34:00,350
then D-pad down.

3565
03:34:00,350 --> 03:34:02,350
Means down, down, forward, then forward.

3566
03:34:02,350 --> 03:34:04,979
Okay, down,

3567
03:34:04,979 --> 03:34:09,780
forward, down, forward, down.

3568
03:34:09,780 --> 03:34:11,780
This is why fighting games aren't mainstream, folks.

3569
03:34:11,780 --> 03:34:14,399
Well,

3570
03:34:14,399 --> 03:34:20,159
I don't know about that.

3571
03:34:20,159 --> 03:34:28,030
If I hold left, it should charge.

3572
03:34:28,030 --> 03:34:30,030
I don't even get to do one move.

3573
03:34:30,030 --> 03:34:32,030
He did one...got it!

3574
03:34:32,030 --> 03:34:35,680
Why did I get hurt by that?

3575
03:34:35,680 --> 03:34:40,930
This is why

3576
03:34:40,930 --> 03:34:42,930
Smash is the most popular fighting game,

3577
03:34:42,930 --> 03:34:45,739
Omega Low.

3578
03:34:45,739 --> 03:34:47,739
Fox is at the bottom of the tier list.

3579
03:34:47,739 --> 03:34:58,370
I have to win one.

3580
03:34:58,370 --> 03:35:08,079
Come on!

3581
03:35:08,079 --> 03:35:10,079
It's anybody's game.

3582
03:35:10,079 --> 03:35:14,879
Don't lose.

3583
03:35:14,879 --> 03:35:22,940
Do a leg sweep.

3584
03:35:22,940 --> 03:35:26,139
I'm trying, man.

3585
03:35:26,139 --> 03:35:30,110
Please block.

3586
03:35:30,110 --> 03:35:32,110
Block. That's block.

3587
03:35:39,120 --> 03:35:48,020
Get the fuck out of here!

3588
03:35:48,020 --> 03:35:51,149
What was that?

3589
03:36:04,139 --> 03:36:06,139
That's frame precedence?

3590
03:36:06,139 --> 03:36:08,139
What's with the frame precedence? Bullshit.

3591
03:36:08,139 --> 03:36:22,670
Trying to figure out moves.

3592
03:36:22,670 --> 03:36:26,959
He's doing a...

3593
03:36:26,959 --> 03:36:28,959
I just got fatality'd.

3594
03:36:28,959 --> 03:36:35,170
Have you found the block button?

3595
03:36:35,170 --> 03:36:37,170
Yeah, it's B, but I can't even block.

3596
03:36:37,170 --> 03:36:44,450
He gets to throw shit

3597
03:36:44,450 --> 03:36:56,420
in the air.

3598
03:36:56,420 --> 03:37:01,260
I just threw something at him.

3599
03:37:01,260 --> 03:37:03,260
He gets such fucking

3600
03:37:03,260 --> 03:37:05,260
frame precedence, it's not even fair.

3601
03:37:05,260 --> 03:37:07,260
We both move at the same time,

3602
03:37:07,260 --> 03:37:09,260
and then his one hurts me instead of him.

3603
03:37:09,260 --> 03:37:16,239
Instead of me hurting him.

3604
03:37:16,239 --> 03:37:19,120
Block.

3605
03:37:19,120 --> 03:37:28,209
Block's not gonna do shit.

3606
03:37:28,209 --> 03:37:37,469
Sword versus fist.

3607
03:37:37,469 --> 03:37:39,469
I'm gonna check a new character out.

3608
03:37:39,469 --> 03:37:45,680
Do low heavies.

3609
03:37:45,680 --> 03:37:52,780
I don't think there is low heavy.

3610
03:37:52,780 --> 03:37:54,780
I think there's just punch and kick.

3611
03:37:54,780 --> 03:37:58,299
No, don't rematch.

3612
03:37:58,299 --> 03:38:01,629
Alright, one more try.

3613
03:38:01,629 --> 03:38:13,579
It's gonna be quiet.

3614
03:38:20,620 --> 03:38:23,700
It's hard.

3615
03:38:23,700 --> 03:38:35,200
New character.

3616
03:38:35,200 --> 03:38:41,340
You gotta use your burst.

3617
03:38:41,340 --> 03:38:43,340
Yeah, I know.

3618
03:38:43,340 --> 03:38:45,340
Alright, we're gonna do it with Shake.

3619
03:38:45,340 --> 03:38:52,450
We're gonna go with Shakey Jake.

3620
03:38:52,450 --> 03:38:54,450
How am I supposed to know what the tier list looks like?

3621
03:38:54,450 --> 03:38:58,100
Turn the skill level down.

3622
03:38:58,100 --> 03:39:09,299
Alright, here we go.

3623
03:39:09,299 --> 03:39:24,719
I get a weapon this time.

3624
03:39:24,719 --> 03:39:33,739
Do you have any fucking moves?

3625
03:39:36,879 --> 03:39:47,889
Oh, I thought she disappeared.

3626
03:39:47,889 --> 03:39:51,090
Shitty Jake. No, it's just...

3627
03:39:51,090 --> 03:40:02,989
I get to turn the skill level down.

3628
03:40:02,989 --> 03:40:05,489
Get the fuck over here.

3629
03:40:05,489 --> 03:40:18,399
Don't be dazed.

3630
03:40:18,399 --> 03:40:24,030
I got a fucking force field now.

3631
03:40:24,030 --> 03:40:26,030
This play is just so much better.

3632
03:40:26,030 --> 03:40:28,030
This is just somebody that knows exactly how to play this fucking game.

3633
03:40:28,030 --> 03:40:33,790
Dude, you're getting recycled.

3634
03:40:33,790 --> 03:40:41,659
How do you grab?

3635
03:40:41,659 --> 03:40:44,350
I keep getting grabbed.

3636
03:40:44,350 --> 03:40:54,079
I think I got it.

3637
03:40:54,079 --> 03:40:58,110
I'm gonna do the good A bait.

3638
03:40:58,110 --> 03:41:06,239
Is it gonna work every time?

3639
03:41:06,239 --> 03:41:08,239
Come here. Let me win one, please.

3640
03:41:08,239 --> 03:41:22,819
You're getting farmed.

3641
03:41:22,819 --> 03:41:24,819
How does every character have 60 moves?

3642
03:41:24,819 --> 03:41:30,190
Yeah, that's what I want to know too.

3643
03:41:30,190 --> 03:41:32,190
I think they're physically talking about even just low punch and low kick and shit.

3644
03:41:32,190 --> 03:41:53,819
I don't think it's possible to win.

3645
03:41:53,819 --> 03:41:56,059
I know it's physically impossible to win.

3646
03:41:56,059 --> 03:41:58,299
I can't do it.

3647
03:41:58,299 --> 03:42:00,739
Spamming's not gonna help me.

3648
03:42:00,739 --> 03:42:11,870
It's not gonna do anything.

3649
03:42:11,870 --> 03:42:18,909
What do I think of the music?

3650
03:42:18,909 --> 03:42:20,909
I can't even pay attention to it.

3651
03:42:20,909 --> 03:42:27,500
You know when you play a fighting game versus somebody

3652
03:42:27,500 --> 03:42:29,500
and you know that you're a thousand times better than they are?

3653
03:42:29,500 --> 03:42:32,260
And you let up a little

3654
03:42:32,260 --> 03:42:34,260
so they get to win at least one of the matches

3655
03:42:34,260 --> 03:42:38,260
so they don't never fucking play video games with you ever again for the rest of your life?

3656
03:42:38,260 --> 03:42:40,260
Why can't they do that to me here?

3657
03:42:40,260 --> 03:42:48,639
Nobody wants to play with the person that's gonna win every time.

3658
03:42:48,639 --> 03:42:50,639
You gotta give a little bit of give

3659
03:42:50,639 --> 03:42:54,219
so I think that I'm doing okay.

3660
03:42:54,219 --> 03:42:56,219
Even if you're gonna win every single match.

3661
03:42:56,219 --> 03:43:00,190
It's like, man, I got you in that one.

3662
03:43:00,190 --> 03:43:02,190
Yeah, you totally did.

3663
03:43:02,190 --> 03:43:06,540
Nice job, man. I didn't see that coming.

3664
03:43:06,540 --> 03:43:08,540
I didn't see that throw coming.

3665
03:43:08,540 --> 03:43:10,979
Hey, you want to play tomorrow, right?

3666
03:43:10,979 --> 03:43:12,979
Yeah, yeah, I love this game.

3667
03:43:12,979 --> 03:43:16,430
I got him now.

3668
03:43:16,430 --> 03:43:18,430
I got him locked in forever.

3669
03:43:18,430 --> 03:43:21,889
Look at the instructions, lol.

3670
03:43:21,889 --> 03:43:25,149
Yeah, I just read the manual.

3671
03:43:25,149 --> 03:43:27,149
You don't need to send me a PDF.

3672
03:43:27,149 --> 03:43:29,149
You don't need to send me a PDF.

3673
03:43:29,149 --> 03:43:35,739
I have it right here.

3674
03:43:35,739 --> 03:43:43,170
I have the physical. Hold on.

3675
03:43:43,170 --> 03:44:06,850
I want to see these characters. I'm not still gonna lose.

3676
03:44:06,850 --> 03:44:09,600
If I lose

3677
03:44:09,600 --> 03:44:11,600
this next match

3678
03:44:11,600 --> 03:44:13,600
I'll get 50 subs.

3679
03:44:15,600 --> 03:44:45,420
Well, the best character in the game

3680
03:44:45,420 --> 03:44:47,420
he has the Honda Punch.

3681
03:44:47,420 --> 03:44:56,379
Don't get cocky. I can't lose this.

3682
03:44:56,379 --> 03:45:05,280
Yeah, I'm not gonna have to give 50 subs.

3683
03:45:05,280 --> 03:45:16,540
It's not gonna happen.

3684
03:45:16,540 --> 03:45:19,739
It's cheesy. It's not cheesy.

3685
03:45:19,739 --> 03:45:21,739
The developers have it in the game

3686
03:45:21,739 --> 03:45:23,739
so I'm gonna use it.

3687
03:45:23,739 --> 03:45:28,930
Oh.

3688
03:45:28,930 --> 03:45:35,969
Hey, dude, you're kind of being an asshole

3689
03:45:35,969 --> 03:45:37,969
with that kind of exploity kind of move.

3690
03:45:37,969 --> 03:45:39,969
Well, if the devs didn't want it in the game

3691
03:45:39,969 --> 03:45:41,969
they wouldn't have programmed it in.

3692
03:45:41,969 --> 03:45:57,969
I win. No subs.

3693
03:45:57,969 --> 03:46:02,190
I win. No subs.

3694
03:46:02,190 --> 03:46:19,459
Scamming.

3695
03:46:19,459 --> 03:46:21,459
Oh, this is a really important question for you guys.

3696
03:46:21,459 --> 03:46:23,459
So I have

3697
03:46:23,459 --> 03:46:25,459
I didn't even know they were making this.

3698
03:46:25,459 --> 03:46:27,700
I bought it because I wanted to play it on stream

3699
03:46:27,700 --> 03:46:29,700
eventually.

3700
03:46:29,700 --> 03:46:31,700
But, uh, Kingdoms of Alamore

3701
03:46:31,700 --> 03:46:34,510
the re-reckoning

3702
03:46:34,510 --> 03:46:36,510
they re-kind of did the game

3703
03:46:36,510 --> 03:46:38,510
I bought it for Xbox 360.

3704
03:46:38,510 --> 03:46:45,739
Is the Xbox 360 version

3705
03:46:45,739 --> 03:46:47,739
better than the remake?

3706
03:46:47,739 --> 03:46:51,709
Should I play it on the original version?

3707
03:46:51,709 --> 03:46:56,579
Or should I play the new one?

3708
03:46:56,579 --> 03:47:00,479
Shit. But it's fun shit.

3709
03:47:00,479 --> 03:47:03,100
Kingdoms of Alamore. What?

3710
03:47:03,100 --> 03:47:06,500
I'll play either. It's a shitty remaster.

3711
03:47:06,500 --> 03:47:09,440
It's not a remake.

3712
03:47:09,440 --> 03:47:11,440
The game's boring. Don't even play it.

3713
03:47:11,440 --> 03:47:15,729
Bad game. What do you mean bad game?

3714
03:47:15,729 --> 03:47:17,729
New one looks nicer.

3715
03:47:17,729 --> 03:47:20,159
We'll see. Got some quality of life fixes.

3716
03:47:20,159 --> 03:47:25,860
Alright.

3717
03:47:25,860 --> 03:47:27,860
If I end up with less than 50% health

3718
03:47:27,860 --> 03:47:29,860
at the end of this round here

3719
03:47:29,860 --> 03:47:31,860
then I will give 100 subs.

3720
03:47:31,860 --> 03:47:40,430
Good.

3721
03:47:40,430 --> 03:47:47,020
Uh, crisis averted.

3722
03:47:47,020 --> 03:47:49,780
We're good. He's too OP.

3723
03:47:49,780 --> 03:48:08,340
I'm fine.

3724
03:48:08,340 --> 03:48:11,860
Ah!

3725
03:48:11,860 --> 03:48:32,719
I didn't make any bets this time.

3726
03:48:32,719 --> 03:48:34,719
Every anime fight ever.

3727
03:48:34,719 --> 03:48:46,989
Get off!

3728
03:48:46,989 --> 03:48:50,639
Ten seconds.

3729
03:48:50,639 --> 03:48:52,879
It just goes to...

3730
03:48:52,879 --> 03:49:02,219
Nevermind.

3731
03:49:02,219 --> 03:49:04,219
I was looking at chat. I wasn't paying attention to the game.

3732
03:49:04,219 --> 03:49:08,260
I was looking at the chat room.

3733
03:49:08,260 --> 03:49:10,500
I think my 3DO is

3734
03:49:10,500 --> 03:49:13,309
overheating.

3735
03:49:13,309 --> 03:49:15,489
Where's my character?

3736
03:49:15,489 --> 03:49:17,489
Why am I green?

3737
03:49:17,489 --> 03:49:20,620
What is happening?

3738
03:49:20,620 --> 03:49:22,620
I think the 3DO is going to break.

3739
03:49:22,620 --> 03:49:24,620
This thing was 600 bucks.

3740
03:49:24,620 --> 03:49:27,950
It better not be breaking.

3741
03:49:27,950 --> 03:49:38,370
It's going to be fine.

3742
03:49:38,370 --> 03:49:40,370
By the way, it's not even 600.

3743
03:49:40,370 --> 03:49:42,670
We're good.

3744
03:49:42,670 --> 03:49:44,850
It was way less than 600 bucks.

3745
03:49:44,850 --> 03:49:48,430
I just want you to think that I spent way too much money on this.

3746
03:49:48,430 --> 03:49:53,489
Dunk it in water.

3747
03:49:53,489 --> 03:49:55,489
Wait a minute.

3748
03:49:57,489 --> 03:50:05,920
Okay.

3749
03:50:05,920 --> 03:50:10,530
Put it in rice.

3750
03:50:10,530 --> 03:50:12,829
Put the 3DO in a bag of rice.

3751
03:50:12,829 --> 03:50:22,239
And then put it in the fridge.

3752
03:50:22,239 --> 03:50:43,469
I learned a new move.

3753
03:50:43,469 --> 03:50:47,440
This is horrible fucking gameplay.

3754
03:50:47,440 --> 03:50:53,069
I'm embarrassed for you.

3755
03:50:53,069 --> 03:50:55,069
Because you're watching me do this.

3756
03:50:55,069 --> 03:50:57,069
You know what I mean?

3757
03:50:57,069 --> 03:50:59,069
I'm embarrassed for you guys.

3758
03:50:59,069 --> 03:51:01,069
Because you have to experience this.

3759
03:51:01,069 --> 03:51:06,190
I'm embarrassed because you guys are

3760
03:51:06,190 --> 03:51:08,190
embarrassed for me.

3761
03:51:08,190 --> 03:51:13,760
So I'm embarrassed for you.

3762
03:51:13,760 --> 03:51:15,760
This gameplay is so bad.

3763
03:51:15,760 --> 03:51:19,149
That if somebody came in right now

3764
03:51:19,149 --> 03:51:21,149
that has never seen me stream

3765
03:51:21,149 --> 03:51:23,149
and watched this, they would have to assume

3766
03:51:23,149 --> 03:51:25,149
that every single one of you was a fucking bot.

3767
03:51:25,149 --> 03:51:27,149
That I was viewbotting.

3768
03:51:27,149 --> 03:51:29,649
This guy's playing a fighting game

3769
03:51:29,649 --> 03:51:31,649
and he's just crouch kicking

3770
03:51:31,649 --> 03:51:37,090
and not talking.

3771
03:51:37,090 --> 03:51:39,090
He's just losing and shit.

3772
03:51:39,090 --> 03:51:41,090
They have to be viewbotting.

3773
03:51:41,090 --> 03:51:46,260
They have to be.

3774
03:51:46,260 --> 03:51:48,260
Why don't you guys just start saying

3775
03:51:48,260 --> 03:51:50,260
you know when somebody's

3776
03:51:50,260 --> 03:51:52,260
just egregiously viewbotting

3777
03:51:52,260 --> 03:51:54,260
and all the comments are just like

3778
03:51:54,260 --> 03:51:56,260
wow, can't believe you just did that.

3779
03:51:56,260 --> 03:51:59,889
Nice one.

3780
03:51:59,889 --> 03:52:04,500
Loving the stream.

3781
03:52:04,500 --> 03:52:15,889
Blowing my mind.

3782
03:52:15,889 --> 03:52:19,979
And then they'll say in the chat

3783
03:52:19,979 --> 03:52:21,979
they'll talk about something that doesn't even exist.

3784
03:52:21,979 --> 03:52:25,250
Hey man, what setup are you using?

3785
03:52:25,250 --> 03:52:27,250
I'm really starting to get into the idea

3786
03:52:27,250 --> 03:52:29,250
of playing games on my PC

3787
03:52:29,250 --> 03:52:31,250
and I'm just curious what I should be using.

3788
03:52:31,250 --> 03:52:33,250
Well I have a GTX 1080

3789
03:52:33,250 --> 03:52:35,940
and that's what I use.

3790
03:52:35,940 --> 03:52:37,940
That's what I would say you should use too.

3791
03:52:37,940 --> 03:52:41,069
What happened to me?

3792
03:52:41,069 --> 03:52:51,059
No, don't use emotes.

3793
03:52:51,059 --> 03:52:53,059
No emotes. Don't do that.

3794
03:52:53,059 --> 03:52:55,059
Only say wow.

3795
03:52:55,059 --> 03:52:57,420
Cool gameplay or something.

3796
03:52:57,420 --> 03:53:09,780
Emotes have given it away.

3797
03:53:09,780 --> 03:53:11,780
I should accidentally alt tab

3798
03:53:11,780 --> 03:53:13,780
and show like five

3799
03:53:13,780 --> 03:53:15,780
viewbotting programs and go oh shit.

3800
03:53:15,780 --> 03:53:34,659
And it's this 56

3801
03:53:34,659 --> 03:53:36,659
this 5,673 people there.

3802
03:53:36,659 --> 03:53:38,659
I alt tab and it's just

3803
03:53:38,659 --> 03:53:40,659
5,672

3804
03:53:40,659 --> 03:53:42,829
viewbots.

3805
03:53:42,829 --> 03:53:44,829
Because I'm watching my own stream.

3806
03:53:44,829 --> 03:53:50,659
I have my own stream open.

3807
03:53:50,659 --> 03:54:04,030
I got power up.

3808
03:54:04,030 --> 03:54:06,399
I'm done.

3809
03:54:06,399 --> 03:54:09,280
I'm done. I'm done.

3810
03:54:09,280 --> 03:54:11,280
I do want to see the secret characters though.

3811
03:54:11,280 --> 03:54:13,280
There's so many people left to fight. I don't want

3812
03:54:13,280 --> 03:54:16,479
no. This one's supposed to be good.

3813
03:54:16,479 --> 03:54:28,940
There's still so many more.

3814
03:54:28,940 --> 03:54:30,940
There's still a stack of like

3815
03:54:30,940 --> 03:54:32,940
fucking so many 3DO games. But we need

3816
03:54:32,940 --> 03:54:34,940
a 3DO break I think after

3817
03:54:34,940 --> 03:54:40,579
this. This is just

3818
03:54:40,579 --> 03:54:42,879
Mortal Kombat.

3819
03:54:42,879 --> 03:54:44,879
And how the fuck is that move fair?

3820
03:54:44,879 --> 03:54:47,700
Explain to me how an entire

3821
03:54:47,700 --> 03:54:49,700
screen filling move. You can't

3822
03:54:49,700 --> 03:54:54,239
dodge this fair. Gonna be blocked?

3823
03:54:54,239 --> 03:54:56,860
Oh it can be. Okay.

3824
03:54:56,860 --> 03:55:03,309
I want to do the uppercut into the acid

3825
03:55:03,309 --> 03:55:06,129
like in Mortal Kombat.

3826
03:55:06,129 --> 03:55:08,129
It's kind of just making me want to play Mortal Kombat.

3827
03:55:08,129 --> 03:55:25,600
Is that me saying hey?

3828
03:55:31,540 --> 03:55:40,239
Stop. Only I can do that.

3829
03:55:40,239 --> 03:55:45,100
So what should we do next?

3830
03:55:45,100 --> 03:55:47,340
What should we do after 3DO? After 3DO

3831
03:55:47,340 --> 03:55:49,579
cooldown. I could do saw.

3832
03:55:49,579 --> 03:55:51,579
I could go back to saw.

3833
03:55:51,579 --> 03:55:53,760
Do saw 2.

3834
03:55:53,760 --> 03:55:55,760
I could do super monkey ball.

3835
03:55:55,760 --> 03:55:59,579
I could do

3836
03:55:59,579 --> 03:56:01,579
face painting. I don't think I'm going to do that.

3837
03:56:01,579 --> 03:56:04,719
Doom Eternal?

3838
03:56:04,719 --> 03:56:06,719
I don't know.

3839
03:56:06,719 --> 03:56:13,250
Monkey ball? Monkey ball next?

3840
03:56:13,250 --> 03:56:15,620
Well not today. But I mean like next stream.

3841
03:56:15,620 --> 03:56:17,620
Monkey ball next stream? Super monkey ball

3842
03:56:17,620 --> 03:56:23,180
next stream?

3843
03:56:23,180 --> 03:56:27,010
Super monkey ball next stream.

3844
03:56:27,010 --> 03:56:29,010
Lock it in.

3845
03:56:29,010 --> 03:56:42,750
There's one. That's a no more baby

3846
03:56:42,750 --> 03:56:45,180
games. Yeah and then I'll go

3847
03:56:45,180 --> 03:56:47,180
you know what? We'll do VR. I'm going to give you a date for VR.

3848
03:56:47,180 --> 03:56:49,180
Because there's so many VR games I need to compile.

3849
03:56:49,180 --> 03:56:51,180
Let's do VR.

3850
03:56:51,180 --> 03:56:55,090
Let's do VR.

3851
03:56:55,090 --> 03:56:57,840
How about

3852
03:57:01,840 --> 03:57:05,229
Let's do VR.

3853
03:57:05,229 --> 03:57:07,229
The week of the 28th.

3854
03:57:07,229 --> 03:57:09,229
And then we'll lead into

3855
03:57:09,229 --> 03:57:11,229
FTK.

3856
03:57:11,229 --> 03:57:14,620
So we'll do some VR stuff.

3857
03:57:14,620 --> 03:57:16,620
For like that 28th.

3858
03:57:16,620 --> 03:57:19,120
The week of the 29th. 30th.

3859
03:57:19,120 --> 03:57:21,120
Lock it in. I want to get back into it.

3860
03:57:21,120 --> 03:57:32,620
It's been a long time.

3861
03:57:32,620 --> 03:57:34,620
Half Life Alyx? Yeah.

3862
03:57:34,620 --> 03:57:37,120
We'll start with Half Life Alyx.

3863
03:57:37,120 --> 03:57:47,549
That's something I've wanted to do for a long time.

3864
03:57:47,549 --> 03:57:49,549
What about Drew Crew?

3865
03:57:49,549 --> 03:57:51,979
Drew Crew is I think not going to happen

3866
03:57:51,979 --> 03:57:55,309
for a while. You got that

3867
03:57:55,309 --> 03:57:57,549
one chance randomly a few

3868
03:57:57,549 --> 03:57:59,549
weeks ago. Remember where I panicked because

3869
03:57:59,549 --> 03:58:01,549
I didn't have anything to do and had nothing to play and I freaked

3870
03:58:01,549 --> 03:58:03,549
out. Something happened.

3871
03:58:03,549 --> 03:58:05,549
What happened? And I opened up

3872
03:58:05,549 --> 03:58:07,549
one of the Nancy Drew games and then I immediately closed

3873
03:58:07,549 --> 03:58:10,370
and freaked out. When was that?

3874
03:58:10,370 --> 03:58:20,219
Okay. It was weird.

3875
03:58:20,219 --> 03:58:23,549
It was Fall Guys? Oh

3876
03:58:23,549 --> 03:58:25,549
that's right because the Fall Guys servers were off.

3877
03:58:25,549 --> 03:58:41,600
I haven't done that move.

3878
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:43,600
I don't even like this game but I'm still here.

3879
03:58:43,600 --> 03:58:45,600
I don't know. It's alright.

3880
03:58:45,600 --> 03:58:52,770
These songs are all the same song.

3881
03:58:52,770 --> 03:59:03,440
Uh oh.

3882
03:59:03,440 --> 03:59:08,430
I need to play Lisa the Painful.

3883
03:59:08,430 --> 03:59:10,430
I'm not going to play Lisa the Painful.

3884
03:59:10,430 --> 03:59:22,270
Not on stream.

3885
03:59:22,270 --> 03:59:31,040
Can you play

3886
03:59:31,040 --> 03:59:34,750
SSX Tricky?

3887
03:59:34,750 --> 03:59:38,590
I don't know.

3888
03:59:38,590 --> 03:59:42,049
It's going to be a painful

3889
03:59:42,049 --> 03:59:44,049
chat experience. What about Ratatouille?

3890
03:59:44,049 --> 03:59:46,860
Funny that you say that.

3891
03:59:46,860 --> 03:59:50,879
I told you that over the next couple of weeks.

3892
03:59:50,879 --> 03:59:53,569
I wasn't going to tell you when it was going to happen.

3893
03:59:53,569 --> 03:59:55,809
But Ratatouille is

3894
03:59:55,809 --> 03:59:57,809
going to happen. I'm not going to tell you when.

3895
03:59:57,809 --> 04:00:05,299
It's going to happen when you least

3896
04:00:05,299 --> 04:00:13,680
expect it. That wouldn't have been great if I had that

3897
04:00:13,680 --> 04:00:20,209
ready to go right now and I switched right now.

3898
04:00:20,209 --> 04:00:22,209
It's not going to replace FTK.

3899
04:00:22,209 --> 04:00:28,860
Can you go off the edge?

3900
04:00:28,860 --> 04:00:38,260
You wouldn't expect it during FTK.

3901
04:00:38,260 --> 04:00:40,260
Yeah, neither would I because that would be

3902
04:00:40,260 --> 04:00:42,260
a

3903
04:00:42,260 --> 04:00:44,260
waste of resources

3904
04:00:44,260 --> 04:00:46,430
and time.

3905
04:00:46,430 --> 04:00:49,440
When is FTK? October 3rd.

3906
04:00:49,440 --> 04:00:51,440
3 p.m. Pacific. October 3rd is the new

3907
04:00:51,440 --> 04:01:04,370
date for FTK.

3908
04:01:04,370 --> 04:01:09,739
The Gran Turismo 4.

3909
04:01:09,739 --> 04:01:11,739
Is there any actual driving game

3910
04:01:11,739 --> 04:01:13,739
that would be fun to scream? Would that be fun?

3911
04:01:13,739 --> 04:01:16,430
Is that one of those scenarios

3912
04:01:16,430 --> 04:01:18,430
where I would just be terrible at it and it would crash

3913
04:01:18,430 --> 04:01:20,430
and I'd give up after five minutes?

3914
04:01:20,430 --> 04:01:31,629
How?

3915
04:01:31,629 --> 04:01:33,629
Showrunner?

3916
04:01:33,629 --> 04:01:35,629
I actually looked into that. I just want to be able to drive

3917
04:01:35,629 --> 04:01:37,629
cargo over snow and mud

3918
04:01:37,629 --> 04:01:39,629
and stuff, right? It might be fun.

3919
04:01:39,629 --> 04:01:41,809
Maybe I'll play that soon.

3920
04:01:41,809 --> 04:01:51,860
We should do an FTK

3921
04:01:51,860 --> 04:01:55,379
command.

3922
04:01:55,379 --> 04:02:01,649
We'll play the Ratatouille game

3923
04:02:01,649 --> 04:02:03,649
on September 28th.

3924
04:02:03,649 --> 04:02:06,459
What? Oh, shit.

3925
04:02:06,459 --> 04:02:08,459
I actually did promise it already

3926
04:02:08,459 --> 04:02:10,459
when you least expect it, right?

3927
04:02:10,459 --> 04:02:16,989
Oh.

3928
04:02:16,989 --> 04:02:18,989
Did he just say find something new?

3929
04:02:18,989 --> 04:02:20,989
He's mad that I'm doing the same move.

3930
04:02:20,989 --> 04:02:24,700
He's getting bored of the scream too, just like

3931
04:02:24,700 --> 04:02:28,670
you guys are.

3932
04:02:28,670 --> 04:02:38,260
On VR!

3933
04:02:38,260 --> 04:02:40,260
I don't expect you to keep your promise. Yeah, I did

3934
04:02:40,260 --> 04:02:42,260
every promise on July 30th.

3935
04:02:42,260 --> 04:02:48,719
Alright, there are only two

3936
04:02:48,719 --> 04:02:50,719
I'm going to try as hard as I can to get through this. I want to beat the game.

3937
04:02:50,719 --> 04:02:59,659
I'm ready.

3938
04:02:59,659 --> 04:03:01,659
I'm going to just absolutely steamroll

3939
04:03:01,659 --> 04:03:03,659
the other two competitors. Let's go.

3940
04:03:03,659 --> 04:03:09,549
Do VR and Ratatouille?

3941
04:03:09,549 --> 04:03:11,729
This whole

3942
04:03:11,729 --> 04:03:13,729
room has to be set up for VR and has to

3943
04:03:13,729 --> 04:03:15,729
stay that way for a little while.

3944
04:03:15,729 --> 04:03:18,159
I like to stand up and do VR. I don't really like

3945
04:03:18,159 --> 04:03:20,159
the seated VR. That makes me want to puke.

3946
04:03:20,159 --> 04:03:22,459
So,

3947
04:03:22,459 --> 04:03:24,459
standing VR, I have to kind of

3948
04:03:24,459 --> 04:03:26,459
move stuff in the room and get it ready, so it has to stay

3949
04:03:26,459 --> 04:03:34,139
like that for a little while. Beat Saber?

3950
04:03:34,139 --> 04:03:36,139
I played Beat Saber already. It was good.

3951
04:03:36,139 --> 04:03:38,139
I had a lot of fun.

3952
04:03:38,139 --> 04:03:40,139
I don't know if I would play it again, but I played

3953
04:03:40,139 --> 04:03:42,139
a lot of it during the last VR stream.

3954
04:03:42,139 --> 04:03:58,850
I'm not going to find something new. This works.

3955
04:03:58,850 --> 04:04:03,010
I'm not ready to order

3956
04:04:03,010 --> 04:04:05,010
anything else off the menu yet. I know what I like.

3957
04:04:05,010 --> 04:04:16,139
Hag me when Jerma

3958
04:04:16,139 --> 04:04:20,299
lies. Uh, one time

3959
04:04:20,299 --> 04:04:22,299
I shoved a brick of cheese up my nose.

3960
04:04:22,299 --> 04:04:36,770
True, true. Okay, how about this?

3961
04:04:36,770 --> 04:04:38,770
I'm going to stream for another 12 hours

3962
04:04:38,770 --> 04:04:42,799
today. Is this the last boss?

3963
04:04:42,799 --> 04:04:50,860
Is this the boss?

3964
04:04:50,860 --> 04:04:52,860
I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna.

3965
04:05:05,620 --> 04:05:07,860
That's not true. Hag him.

3966
04:05:07,860 --> 04:05:15,020
Platforms? Yeah, this is kind of cool.

3967
04:05:15,020 --> 04:05:23,020
Cheesed your way to victory.

3968
04:05:23,020 --> 04:05:25,520
Yes.

3969
04:05:25,520 --> 04:05:38,959
It's still a victory. He's

3970
04:05:38,959 --> 04:05:42,989
so pissed. He doesn't want to give me

3971
04:05:42,989 --> 04:05:45,360
the medal at the end of the game.

3972
04:05:45,360 --> 04:05:47,360
Oh, damn it. Do something different.

3973
04:05:47,360 --> 04:05:49,360
You know, I've never had to get at a good asshole

3974
04:05:49,360 --> 04:05:56,659
like you with a trophy.

3975
04:05:56,659 --> 04:06:00,750
Now what? I won. You don't deserve it.

3976
04:06:00,750 --> 04:06:04,450
Let's get to the end.

3977
04:06:07,389 --> 04:06:12,450
Oh, I got

3978
04:06:12,450 --> 04:06:14,450
Contra'd.

3979
04:06:14,450 --> 04:06:17,069
Yeah, I got to the level 3 in Contra on

3980
04:06:17,069 --> 04:06:19,069
easy and the game said, uh, please

3981
04:06:19,069 --> 04:06:21,069
please play again.

3982
04:06:21,069 --> 04:06:23,069
This time on the normal difficulty.

3983
04:06:23,069 --> 04:06:34,190
Well, yeah, that's okay.

3984
04:06:34,190 --> 04:06:36,190
All right. All right.

3985
04:06:36,190 --> 04:06:38,190
I'm gonna call it here.

3986
04:06:38,190 --> 04:06:40,750
We're gonna come back with Super Monkey Ball.

3987
04:06:40,750 --> 04:06:45,489
Monkey Ball now? I can't do Monkey Ball

3988
04:06:45,489 --> 04:06:50,350
now. I have

3989
04:06:50,350 --> 04:06:52,350
discs surrounding me. I have to

3990
04:06:52,350 --> 04:06:54,350
clean this shit up.

3991
04:06:56,350 --> 04:06:58,350
Today was Psychic Detective

3992
04:06:58,350 --> 04:07:00,350
Day and I loved every second of it.

3993
04:07:03,170 --> 04:07:05,170
There's a bunch more 3DO stuff, but

3994
04:07:05,170 --> 04:07:07,170
I think we need, we need to, we need to cool down.

3995
04:07:07,170 --> 04:07:09,170
It's too much.

3996
04:07:09,170 --> 04:07:11,170
Too much weird shit in a row.

3997
04:07:15,340 --> 04:07:17,340
So I will see you guys

3998
04:07:17,340 --> 04:07:19,340
on

3999
04:07:19,340 --> 04:07:21,340
uh, on Monday.

4000
04:07:21,340 --> 04:07:23,340
I'll see you Monday.

4001
04:07:23,340 --> 04:07:26,219
For Super Monkey Ball.

4002
04:07:28,219 --> 04:07:30,219
Gritty goes on fire. Yeah, it's like

4003
04:07:30,219 --> 04:07:32,219
freaking me out. Things like heating up and glitching

4004
04:07:32,219 --> 04:07:34,219
and shit.

4005
04:07:34,219 --> 04:07:36,530
See you guys for

4006
04:07:36,530 --> 04:07:38,530
Super Monkey Ball.

4007
04:07:38,530 --> 04:07:40,530
Thanks for watching as always.

4008
04:07:40,530 --> 04:07:42,530
Just watch the Psychic Detective endings

4009
04:07:42,530 --> 04:07:44,530
on YouTube.

4010
04:07:44,530 --> 04:07:46,530
Maybe I will in the bath later.

4011
04:07:54,530 --> 04:07:56,530
I have to turn this guy off.

4012
04:07:56,530 --> 04:07:58,530
I have to turn this guy off.

4013
04:08:04,530 --> 04:08:06,530
This guy's gotta go.

4014
04:08:06,530 --> 04:08:08,530
The bath stream?

4015
04:08:08,530 --> 04:08:10,530
Okay, if I had

4016
04:08:10,530 --> 04:08:12,530
clothes on, could I do a bath stream?

4017
04:08:12,530 --> 04:08:17,840
Would that be okay?

4018
04:08:17,840 --> 04:08:21,620
Yes. Would it?

4019
04:08:21,620 --> 04:08:25,840
Alright, well let me think about that.

4020
04:08:25,840 --> 04:08:28,590
I'll think about that. Uh, let's go say hello

4021
04:08:28,590 --> 04:08:31,790
to Vinny. Like seven

4022
04:08:31,790 --> 04:08:35,120
days to die.

4023
04:08:35,120 --> 04:08:41,139
Not yet. Not yet.

4024
04:08:41,139 --> 04:08:43,889
Because we have credits to do.

4025
04:08:43,889 --> 04:08:45,889
Who's that guy? I want to be that character. That was like

4026
04:08:45,889 --> 04:08:48,190
Skeletor from, uh,

4027
04:08:48,190 --> 04:08:50,430
Prang. What?

4028
04:08:50,430 --> 04:08:52,430
What's the game called?

4029
04:08:52,430 --> 04:08:54,430
What the fuck is the name of the game? The game with the

4030
04:08:54,430 --> 04:08:56,430
skeleton with the sword and the shield. What is it?

4031
04:08:56,430 --> 04:08:59,250
Uh, what is it called?

4032
04:08:59,250 --> 04:09:02,639
Kill, uh,

4033
04:09:02,639 --> 04:09:09,549
Killer Instinct. Not the

4034
04:09:09,549 --> 04:09:11,549
brain that sits inside of the guy in Ninja Turtles.

4035
04:09:11,549 --> 04:09:15,069
No. Alright, here come the

4036
04:09:15,069 --> 04:09:17,069
credits. Thanks for watching everybody.

4037
04:09:17,069 --> 04:09:21,299
Ooh, this is different.

4038
04:09:21,299 --> 04:09:28,260
Ooh, this is

4039
04:09:28,260 --> 04:09:34,719
cool. Uh, that's pretty

4040
04:09:34,719 --> 04:09:36,719
sick actually. Nice job.

4041
04:09:36,719 --> 04:09:44,850
Thank god the music ended.

4042
04:09:44,850 --> 04:09:46,850
Now it's readable. That's actually

4043
04:09:46,850 --> 04:09:49,920
readable. Thanks for the subs

4044
04:09:49,920 --> 04:09:52,479
everybody. I appreciate it.

4045
04:09:52,479 --> 04:09:54,479
It's like your names are being etched

4046
04:09:54,479 --> 04:10:01,459
into the book. How long does it take? I mean,

4047
04:10:01,459 --> 04:10:03,459
we're at age. I can't be that much longer.

4048
04:10:03,459 --> 04:10:09,469
I mean, there's a lot of subs.

4049
04:10:09,469 --> 04:10:11,469
There's always a lot of subs. It always takes a long time.

4050
04:10:11,469 --> 04:10:16,079
There's always tons of fucking subs.

4051
04:10:16,079 --> 04:10:20,030
Happy birthday.

4052
04:10:20,030 --> 04:10:22,459
Am I gonna stream on my birthday?

4053
04:10:22,459 --> 04:10:24,459
Oh shit, I might have a

4054
04:10:24,459 --> 04:10:26,459
birthday stream on Monday.

4055
04:10:26,459 --> 04:10:31,459
It might be a happy birthday stream

4056
04:10:31,459 --> 04:10:37,219
on Monday. That's very possible.

4057
04:10:37,219 --> 04:10:41,700
I'll bake myself a birthday cake.

4058
04:10:41,700 --> 04:10:45,790
There needs to be music, doesn't there?

4059
04:10:45,790 --> 04:10:50,270
Oh, the music's not even hooked up here.

4060
04:10:50,270 --> 04:10:54,430
How old are you? 74th birthday?

4061
04:10:54,430 --> 04:10:56,860
No. You guys can take a guess of how

4062
04:10:56,860 --> 04:11:00,700
old I am. Wish my dad a happy birthday.

4063
04:11:00,700 --> 04:11:02,940
Hey, Tasty Turd! You might not

4064
04:11:02,940 --> 04:11:05,120
know that that's your son's screen name.

4065
04:11:05,120 --> 04:11:07,120
And you might have just heard that. Wait, it's my

4066
04:11:07,120 --> 04:11:09,120
birthday, and my son's screen name is

4067
04:11:09,120 --> 04:11:11,120
Tasty Turd, but I'm sorry to be the one to

4068
04:11:11,120 --> 04:11:13,600
bring that up first. But

4069
04:11:13,600 --> 04:11:15,600
your son says happy birthday, dad.

4070
04:11:15,600 --> 04:11:24,290
Thank you, Tasty Turd.

4071
04:11:24,290 --> 04:11:26,780
I will see you guys on Monday.

4072
04:11:26,780 --> 04:11:30,299
Have a great rest of your night. We're gonna raid Vinny.

4073
04:11:30,299 --> 04:11:34,209
Go say hello. Take care

4074
04:11:34,209 --> 04:11:43,149
of yourselves. And good night.

4075
04:11:43,149 --> 04:11:45,149
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a second, wait a second,

4076
04:11:45,149 --> 04:11:47,579
wait a second. I'm gonna give $100

4077
04:11:47,579 --> 04:11:49,579
earlier. I wanna make sure I catch

4078
04:11:49,579 --> 04:11:52,139
this. I just caught it right here.

4079
04:11:52,139 --> 04:11:54,139
10,000 bits

4080
04:11:54,139 --> 04:11:56,770
from

4081
04:11:56,770 --> 04:11:58,770
Makao

4082
04:11:58,770 --> 04:12:00,770
Nuko. Thank you for the

4083
04:12:00,770 --> 04:12:03,389
$100.

4084
04:12:03,389 --> 04:12:05,389
Irma, your content always seems to make me laugh and I'm feeling

4085
04:12:05,389 --> 04:12:07,389
down. I started watching a YouTube video seven

4086
04:12:07,389 --> 04:12:09,389
years ago. Keep doing

4087
04:12:09,389 --> 04:12:11,389
what you enjoy. Lots of love.

4088
04:12:11,389 --> 04:12:15,680
Thanks a lot. Seven years is a long time.

4089
04:12:15,680 --> 04:12:17,680
I'm surprised that

4090
04:12:17,680 --> 04:12:19,979
some of you guys have been around for that long and you still

4091
04:12:19,979 --> 04:12:23,569
think this is interesting. I think we've

4092
04:12:23,569 --> 04:12:25,569
said this before, but even after like watching seven or

4093
04:12:25,569 --> 04:12:27,870
eight seasons straight years

4094
04:12:27,870 --> 04:12:29,870
of a TV show,

4095
04:12:29,870 --> 04:12:31,870
you kind of start to go,

4096
04:12:31,870 --> 04:12:34,370
eh, I'm kind of over it. So

4097
04:12:34,370 --> 04:12:36,979
I'm just happy that a lot of you guys

4098
04:12:36,979 --> 04:12:39,149
are still around. I'm glad that you are.

4099
04:12:39,149 --> 04:12:43,059
You didn't say it was interesting.

4100
04:12:43,059 --> 04:12:48,799
Alright

4101
04:12:48,799 --> 04:12:50,799
guys, I'll see you later. See you

4102
04:12:50,799 --> 04:12:53,299
Monday. Let's go raid

4103
04:12:53,299 --> 04:12:57,579
Vinesauce. See you

4104
04:12:57,579 --> 04:13:30,219
later.
