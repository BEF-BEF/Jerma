00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:12,419
Hi guys. Let's talk about this. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. I'm flustered already.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,600
And I haven't even started anything. A little ill. I've been feeling ill. I've been watching TV.

3
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:25,100
But listen, I just found the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen on a computer. And it's on

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:33,079
my computer. I own a computer and I found the worst thing ever. All the shit that I talk about. Oh,

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,759
I can't believe this. This person has this. Can't believe this company. I have the worst

6
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:46,070
computer case. I just found out why. Just in a moment, you'll find out. I'm gonna tweet that.

7
00:00:46,070 --> 00:01:34,629
One second. All right. So I, as you guys know, I'm just your average Joe. I'm not a computer

8
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:40,859
scientist. I dabble in it sometimes. I think it's fun to build them. But here's the issue. I got a

9
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:48,060
USB cable. I have the USB front panel right on the top of my computer on the case is USBs. Four of

10
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,500
them. And then next to that is this thing called the power button, where you press it and your

11
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,939
computer turns on. Or if you hold it, you can force shut off. Everybody has power button. Okay.

12
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:06,700
If for some reason, directly next to the left of the power button is a reset button,

13
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:16,889
and it is touch sensitive. I didn't, I just found this out. I'm trying to plug in my USB from my

14
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:24,439
fucking Xbox controller. And I like slightly grazed this other little button right to the

15
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:31,400
right of that slot. And my computer reset. What is the, what does that, what function is that?

16
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:42,379
Why would you have a fucking Nintendo reset button on a PC? Is this a fucking Super Nintendo? Why is

17
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:54,870
that here? To reset the computer. No, it's a restart, not like a reset. That fucking thing.

18
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,629
No bullshit. Here's what that thing should be. Okay. Shouldn't be a button that you can just

19
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:06,629
like slightly graze and then it's a meme audio. You're trying to turn on the fucking Nintendo.

20
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:13,030
No, no, no. Have that be a hole where you can stick a fucking pin in like a actual reset button.

21
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,580
I can't fucking believe it. I turned my computer off. I was about to turn the stream on.

22
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,319
My computer restarted and I had to set everything back up again. Oh, I was fucking flustered.

23
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:38,900
Just don't press the button. What, but what, but why is it there? Fucking computer cases, man.

24
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,469
The things that just goddamn plastic and steel. That's what people want. Don't, you don't have to

25
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:49,750
add any frills. Just give me the good face plate and things made it a goddamn plastic and glass.

26
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,069
It's all right. You don't have to do that. Some fun buttons. How about this one is like the help

27
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:59,590
button. My keyboard. You got a keyboard. Look down right now at your keyboard. Does it have a help

28
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:13,000
button? Pry it off with pliers. Tonight we're going to play Celeste. As you can see on the

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:25,139
screen right now. There it is. Jeremy, are you okay right now? Yeah, I just, I couldn't believe it. I

30
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,459
couldn't believe that I accidentally restarted my computer because I tried to plug a USB in.

31
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:38,420
I hope you guys had a good few days. I haven't seen you guys in a little while.

32
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:52,730
Was not supposed to be off yesterday, but I was feeling fucking shitty physically.

33
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:58,410
And I really didn't think I was going to be able to sit here for, you know, three, four, five plus

34
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:05,209
hours. So, but I thought I should be okay today. I should be okay today. I mean, okay right now.

35
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:15,850
Yeah. You can always tell my level of health by the old person rant that I do at the beginning of

36
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:23,540
the stream and how many swear words were in it. So I don't know. I have no idea what this game is

37
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:32,009
about. I know that it's a game about climbing up a mountain and I know it's a platformer.

38
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:37,699
I don't know. It's kind of like in the realm of Super Meat Boy. Am I wrong? Is this completely,

39
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:52,569
is this not even the right way to describe this game? Is this like Super Meat Boy? Kind of. Well,

40
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:57,540
let's find out. What do you say? I have been told, Jeremy, you have to turn the music up.

41
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,899
Otherwise I'm leaving. So we're going to turn it down a couple of notches and let's get the

42
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:11,189
sound in a good spot. Sounds about right. Ah, all right. Fine. We'll get it to five,

43
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:19,500
six and a five for the general average rating. This stream is probably going to get by the end

44
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:29,050
of the stream from the audience itself. Now let's climb. Did I choose, choose character?

45
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:37,829
Assist mode. Should I, what should I do about that? Should I keep the assist mode off? Rename.

46
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:59,850
Uh, keep it off. How about a series of numbers? Jax. Should it be Jax? I don't know. I've been

47
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,610
feeling kind of ill the last couple of days. I'm not sure Jax is going to make an appearance.

48
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:12,120
Jax is down in my like lower intestine right now, hiding. Is there like a, okay, is there a

49
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:22,709
mid-level Jax that we can try to figure out here? Cause Jax is like Super God. Jonks? Does that work?

50
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:48,360
How about just Jon? All right. Jonks. Jon. Just J-O-N. Jonks. Now I think it has to be Jon.

51
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,319
This Jerma, this Jax, and then his Jon. You guys don't want Jon. Let me just tell you.

52
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:20,199
If today's going to be a Jon day, this is it. Jon. Oh man. I can already tell I'm going to have

53
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:39,610
problems. Just breathe. Okay. I'll listen. Should I breathe out? Okay. What's wrong with my computer?

54
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:48,200
What is wrong? What's my computer doing? What's wrong with my computer? Whoa. What the fuck?

55
00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:12,539
I got a virus. There must be a virus. All right. So press A to jump. Press B to jump. Press A to

56
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:25,980
jump. Press C to jump. Press B to jump. Oh, okay. This is not, how do I read? Is there a fast run?

57
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:39,990
If I hold down Super Meat Boy Y, hold LT to climb and then press up. Okay. That's not,

58
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:47,259
that's not bad. I will say I'm okay. Does right trigger do the same thing? It does. I would rather

59
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:57,370
do right trigger. He's asking a question in the tutorial. What? Just, just relax. Okay. Did you

60
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:05,129
breathe? Excuse me, ma'am. Do you want me to do, do you want me to do voice acting here?

61
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:11,500
The sign is busted. This, is this mountain, is this the mountain trail?

62
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:19,379
You're almost there. It's across the bridge.

63
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:35,460
Tell us about your driveway. The bridge collapsed and I nearly died.

64
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:48,279
My driveway almost did you in. The mountain might be a bit much for you.

65
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:56,100
Is Jerma doing the beeps? I don't know what, I have no idea what you're talking about.

66
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,779
My computer's making weird noises though.

67
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,929
Well, if I'm an old bat, like you can survive out here. Like I think you'll be, there's no likes.

68
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,250
Like if I'm an old bat and like, why am I doing that? But you should know Celeste mountain is a

69
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:39,509
strange place. You might see things, things you ain't ready to see. Uh, you should seek help lady.

70
00:11:44,470 --> 00:12:01,990
That lady just did the Super Mario fucking theme song. She's still laughing at me.

71
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:26,039
Is the bridge going to collapse? Of course it should. Dash. Ah, there's a dash. Okay.

72
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:40,309
So X is dash. You can do this. I know. I mean, I know I can. You're talking to her.

73
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:49,929
You're talking to John. So there's a level select. Chapter one forsaken city. Climate.

74
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,730
Click save and quit from the pause menu at any time to take a break.

75
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,889
You resume from the same screen and you won't lose any progress. You know

76
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:10,169
when a video game gives you the we-mote take a break sun warning that you're probably going to

77
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:24,179
have to at some point cause it's going to be hard. Okay. Oh, I got to change that one because I'm

78
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:31,779
used to holding down that X or square button for a fast run. It's just the platform of blood that

79
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:38,100
runs through my veins. All of you know what I'm talking about. Holding down X, holding down Y

80
00:13:38,100 --> 00:14:00,679
to just the run. Oh man. I'm good. I can go up or down. Jump. So what is that? A thousand points.

81
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:10,009
I don't know. Wait, I'm not done. Okay. I only got one. I'm like, ah, I only got one dash.

82
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,330
And when you're okay, when your hair is blue, you've used your dash. That's a really good

83
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,929
fucking high quality indicator to know that you did it. Can it go down? No, that's not down. All

84
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:28,950
right. Here we go. All right. I, I figured it out. You, there are Yakwas in this one.

85
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:49,590
There are Yakwas. Hmm. So I can go, uh, so is it just each stage is a different

86
00:14:49,590 --> 00:15:01,049
Mega Man screen? Is that what I'm understanding? Straight up. Yes. Basically. Okay. That's cool.

87
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,139
What about down there? Is there a secret? Are there secrets in this game that I need to know about?

88
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,259
I already figured out the Yakwas. Okay. But I needed to know if there's other secrets.

89
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:26,419
Whoa, whoa, what happened? What's going on? You can only hold on for so long. Okay. I get it.

90
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:42,679
How long can you hold on long here? All right. I see nothing up in that little crevice.

91
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:55,210
Well, I guess we're just going to go. I just got baited. So these things, I can get those.

92
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:04,309
This is no jumping and this is no dashing. Not allowed. Oh, or it goes away. I get it.

93
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:19,429
Okay. You're going to give me a challenge here. Don't speak so soon. Don't speak so soon streamer.

94
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:48,889
He doesn't even know. Just wait till he gets to the world too. Okay. Let's get the fruit. Oh,

95
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,600
carefully crafted. All right. So no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got, I have a dash still.

96
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,029
Just don't use it until right now. So what do you, what do I get for the, uh,

97
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:19,019
the stroke, the snowberries? Is there like an upgrade feature? It's an ending. Don't tell me

98
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:25,400
the ending. I don't want to know the ending. Oh, here's the ending by the way. Oh my God.

99
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:38,119
What have you done? Uh, anonymous gifter anonymous just gave 20 community subs. Well, whoever you

100
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:50,059
are. Uh, thank you. Really appreciate it. That's a lot. That's fucking so much money. Thank you.

101
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:54,059
And congratulations to all the people that got a community sub. You can now put

102
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:59,579
emotes in the chat and not affected by slow mode and you don't get any ads and I don't play ads

103
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:05,240
on the stream anyways, but you know, all right, let's see. Can I look or should I just look around,

104
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:23,940
just explore? That's a death, right? Oh, there's a strawberry over there. Pay to win chat. Uh oh.

105
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:31,609
I'll figure it out. My brain is bigger than anyone's on earth. I can figure this out.

106
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:53,880
Uh, I think I need to go the other way. Oh shit. Okay. So you can actually, there's, there's physical

107
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:01,930
fitness movement in this. Okay. I get it. So you can actually use that stuff. Cool.

108
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:25,609
So that's a different little globe. Hmm. There's two of them as big as this gets. He's in one of

109
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:39,559
his moods, isn't he? The hell does that mean? Oh my God. Don't die again. No, don't. Oh my God.

110
00:19:39,559 --> 00:20:01,059
I died again. I'm getting so angry at this game. Oh, does it count? No, I've got to complete the

111
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:12,009
level. Okay. He's happy now, but he won't be in a couple hours. Well then we're just going to have

112
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:25,609
to play GeoGuessr. Uh, the way I can get this. I have to go down and around. Look, this is a,

113
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:38,019
this is a Metroidvania. I'm going to unlock another ability. Maybe not. Hold on. I got it.

114
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:51,940
Another 10 community subs. 10 community subs from FergBernandes. Thank you. What?

115
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:09,369
Did I not get it? Huh? That's a speed run feature, isn't it? I got to get them both

116
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,430
in like five seconds. Whatever. This guy will tell me what to do.

117
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,339
No, you've heard it already. I'm not going to do it again.

118
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:30,420
What a killer night for a hike. I guess so.

119
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:41,220
Read chat. Read chat. Read chat. No. All right. Fine. This place is so crazy. I kind of can't,

120
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,019
really is the same noise though. I mean, you got to give me credit for even fucking,

121
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,779
give me some credit here. I didn't fucking know that this was going to happen.

122
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:54,549
I had no fucking idea. I just, you can ask anybody in this house. I just said,

123
00:21:54,549 --> 00:22:00,950
I'm going to use this on stream today. And, but I mean, it's my computer making that noise. So

124
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:07,910
I mean, I'm going to use my computer on stream. Not the easiest climb, is it? But I guess that's

125
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:17,640
what I was looking for. Well, that sounds pretty serious. I'm just happy to see another human in

126
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,920
such a lonely place. It's the same fucking sound. I can't get over it. I'm not going to be able to

127
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:35,660
the whole time. Theo, by the way, an adventure from a far off land. It's not much of a talker,

128
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,420
are you? Serious lone wolf type. I get it. I just imagined some dark backstory for you.

129
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,960
This is where I bring my souls and I'm thinking, I'm thinking like a Dex build,

130
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,039
maybe a little bit of endurance, some vitality, and then stack resistance.

131
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:06,740
Dex, look, there's a fire here and there's an NPC in this little camp over there. Give me a break.

132
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,660
Well, John, I'd say you've come to the right place. I'm freezing my toes off,

133
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,980
but I can't imagine a better place for some quiet reflection.

134
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:20,660
Maybe you're right. Wait, what far off land do you hail from? Well, my inquisitive compatriot,

135
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,380
I don't hail from the mystical. It's going to be like Ohio or something. The mystical exotic kingdom

136
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:36,359
of Seattle. Got you. I wrote this. No, I did. No, I did. I did. No, I did. No, I did. Sounds like a

137
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:46,250
special place. Hey, okay. Anything else? Why would an entire city be abandoned?

138
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:51,529
I read that some mega corporations started building it, but then no one wanted to live here.

139
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:59,289
I wonder why. My money's on a government cover-up. What a waste to build all this for no reason.

140
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:09,509
At least we get to enjoy the leftovers. All right, thanks for the war.

141
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:19,779
Oh, my meat boy instincts are making me just jump off walls, and it's annoying me. This is blocked.

142
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:31,160
Keep talking. Are you here to explore this city? Yeah, I have a thing for abandoned places,

143
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:37,559
and I like to think of myself as a budding photographer. Oh, really? Cool. Do you have a

144
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:49,509
vlog or something? A vlog? John, everyone uses Instapix now. I'm Theo Understars. Look me up.

145
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:57,700
Instapix. This terrain's pretty tricky. Are you turning back soon?

146
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,339
Nope, I'm heading for the summit. I can really see the determination in your eyes.

147
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:08,339
It's inspiring. You say so. I bet you can make it to the summit too.

148
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:18,579
Maybe. I don't really care about reaching the top TBH. Oh, but I heard there are some legit old

149
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:25,460
ruins up beyond the city. Like 1800s legit. I know it's risky, but I have to see them for myself.

150
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,890
I'm gonna do this one more time. What's that thing you say right before you do something

151
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:47,619
irresponsible? You're okay. Let's whatever. I don't know. It's YOLO. I know it's YOLO.

152
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,579
Throw caution to the wind. Ah, no, that's not it. I'm thinking of.

153
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:33,539
This game loses a foe letter grade. Wait, but I gotta collect the gems.

154
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:51,259
I gotta figure out how this works. Wait, hold on. Oh, that's all that does? Well, what's the other

155
00:26:51,339 --> 00:27:04,759
side do? All right, so now let's go get it. Let's go to the right. This is open. There's a lot of

156
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:19,369
ways to go. I missed a secret. Oh, I'm gonna miss them all. Don't worry. I did it. I did it,

157
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:36,170
but I didn't do it. Secret. I don't see a secret over here. How is he supposed to know that it is

158
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:49,049
a secret? I don't know. How would I know that? I can see this. I could go that way. No, we're

159
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:54,490
looking for just game completion. I can load this up later and YOLO into the secret. It's all I want.

160
00:27:55,289 --> 00:28:09,130
It's not just a watch. It's a symbol. Stop saying that.

161
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:45,559
Are you beach ready? Oh, no. Super Meat Boy. Stop making me do things. No idea where I am.

162
00:28:45,559 --> 00:29:09,000
I hope I'm going the right way. Secret over there, right? I found it. See? Ah, I think I got them.

163
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:45,339
No, I need that. Oh, shit. I didn't need to do the dash. Maybe I did. Yes, I did. I've got seven.

164
00:29:45,980 --> 00:30:01,900
I'm not gonna do it. Okay, so I get to go. I guess I gotta do it faster. I gotta do it faster.

165
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:10,660
Meat Boy, stop fucking up my video game. Oh, Super Meat Boy. You made my muscle memory into Meat Boy.

166
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:33,319
Fuck. I gotta go faster. I gotta let go. Switch to commander video. I'm trying to do a double jump.

167
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:52,380
Oh, boy. I had it too. I got it. That counts, right? No, it doesn't. They give you these Pac-Man

168
00:30:52,380 --> 00:31:05,990
fruits and I'm expected to get them all. You can't be expected to get them all. Maybe one. So what

169
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,910
does this do? Okay, here we go. I figured it out already. What first try? Guaranteed. No, no,

170
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:35,210
I'm just kidding. What have been? Oops. Damn it. All right, got it. So I'm gonna say at nine

171
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:52,569
bandages that I'm not gonna get anymore because I don't need them. Oh, I can't. Oh, shit. Did I get

172
00:31:52,569 --> 00:32:09,349
it? Does it count? It counts. Fuck. Oops. I just was out of here. No, hold on. Okay, so we can go

173
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:25,269
up. There's a paid in-game currency right here. I was wrong. Did it wrong. Did it wrong again.

174
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:36,730
Okay, I'm gonna say up, over, left. Meat Boy. Don't, Meat Boy. Side, lift up, boing, boing.

175
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:47,509
Clown car joke incoming. I'm sorry to severely disappoint you, but I do not have a clown car

176
00:32:48,819 --> 00:33:12,119
ready to go. Not right now. Yet. All right, where are we at? Can I go down? I might want to fix that then.

177
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:27,430
What, the clown? Clown car? It's probably in the closet already. Oh, shit. I get it. No, I don't. I

178
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:33,589
could just go around this way. Wait for a charge up and then I want to see down. Oh, come on. I landed

179
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:39,609
on the fucking shark teeth already. I was gonna say just do this. Oh, fuck. That was it. I had to

180
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:57,140
just wait for the charge. Derma, don't touch the spikes. Are you sure? Give me a, come on. It's

181
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:08,170
not gonna work, is it? Oh, fuck. Uh-oh. Yeah, I can't. It's wrong. It's wrong. You have to land for

182
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:26,329
the recharge to even happen. All right, so then I gotta go dash and what do I have to grab here then?

183
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:49,800
Oh, hmm. Oops. Can I knock this down? Ah, I can knock this down. Ah, I can knock that down.

184
00:34:50,519 --> 00:35:08,250
But there's spikes on it. Grab the side? Apparently. What? I have to, all right, I gotta grab the side

185
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:25,989
of that and fall down with it and then jump off of it. You know I'm a fucking meat boy. I gotta get back over

186
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:50,230
there first. Holy shit, I'm just spamming. What are you spamming? Ow, my head. Just hold on. Hold on,

187
00:35:50,230 --> 00:36:08,219
it'll do it again. First boss. I have to jump on his head three times. This memorial is dedicated

188
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:21,050
to those who perished on the climb. Okay, so I've made it. Here's the top of the mountain. I plant a

189
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:38,980
seed in there when a tree grows. I'm exhausted. But see, it's an orange tree. I'm not going to

190
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:51,769
use the automaton. This might have been a mistake. Ow, damn it. God, I thought that just said game

191
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:57,590
over. I was looking over here to my left and I turn and I'm just like game over. Oh, okay.

192
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:17,400
Ten. Ten out of twenty. What? There's so many more places. I have to go. Only ten berries. Yeah,

193
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:28,119
because there's a million places to go. There's so many places to go. This is chapter two old site.

194
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:38,599
Nice automaton, dude. Thanks. I really appreciate that. All right, give me a song. I'll do it right

195
00:37:38,599 --> 00:38:26,019
off the bat. I will first try it. First song I see in the chat. All-star. And all that glitters is

196
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:51,110
gold. Oh, I have to press A. It's so annoying. Shut up. How dare you. I'm kidding. Don't shut up.

197
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,469
Some things are all weird now. Is there a secret message here?

198
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:12,039
This mirror dedicated to those... it's just backwards. That's not how you do it.

199
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:35,480
This is a really pretty land. I can get up there. Look, it's probably a berry up there. Move on,

200
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:50,619
John. I like this place. I knew it. I knew it. I knew that eventually they condition your brain

201
00:39:50,619 --> 00:40:05,590
into thinking that falling down is bad. Falling down is good sometimes. I'm gonna get this. That's

202
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:19,099
the one I can see, so I'm gonna get this one. I thought I was supposed to be climbing a mountain.

203
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:36,260
What the fuck did I just do? What? I obviously have to go like this. Oh, all right. I figured

204
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:47,960
it out. I got it. There's even more of this. I went completely opposite direction of where I

205
00:40:47,960 --> 00:41:00,519
may have supposed to be going. Oh, fuck. Okay. There's a secret down there. How do I get back

206
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:11,739
down there? How do I get... look. I think there's a secret right there. No. How do I restart? The

207
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:42,860
reset button. I need to go down here, land on this, and then... secret berry. Nice. That was cool.

208
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:55,690
Ooh. This is... a door. All right. Can I open the door? There's no way to open that door. How do I

209
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:13,659
get out of here? Like that. Is it a mirror? Whoa. Can I talk to the mirror?

210
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:25,190
All right. Well, I'm not going to react to that, apparently.

211
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:38,179
Whoa. Hold on. But I wasn't even ready. I needed to see what this was. I needed to...

212
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:48,099
I'm so overwhelmed. That was... okay. What is going on? I can hold on to this thing and look down.

213
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:53,750
Let's see. The game... I already knew there was a secret down here, and the game gave me binoculars

214
00:42:53,750 --> 00:43:10,409
to see. But the thing is, though, guys, what the heck is in that cube? Epic just dropped it one day,

215
00:43:10,409 --> 00:43:22,579
and we're all trying to figure it out. Does it give items? Does it hurt you? Can I go up through

216
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:38,650
this? Ah. You go up. So you go all the way through. That's really cool. So no matter what trajectory

217
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:44,329
you go, you can always pass all the way through it. It's good to know. It's right there. I have to

218
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:58,139
do it again. Cool. Is this fall? Secret? Hey, thanks, Fortnite Street. There's so many directions to go.

219
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:09,300
Oh, it turned... it turned him into jelly. I get it. It Christmas caked everything that was

220
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:19,349
impassable before. Cool. Where am I going? There's a secret... extra secret tape over there. I don't

221
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:33,590
know what that does. Fuck. I just pancaked myself, okay? So wait, I gotta go through now, then.

222
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:48,139
So we gotta go like this now. I can't see. I can't see. Oh, shit. Oh, don't...

223
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:56,730
What... what... what the heck is even inside that cube? I don't know. Maybe I should make

224
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:30,840
10 videos about it. B-side unlocked. Music track? All right, I'm gonna give... let's give the... I'm

225
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,320
gonna give this game a couple of extra points for one reason. You ready for the extra point reason?

226
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,099
Like, right now, you are... we're playing American football, and I'm going for the extra point, and

227
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:47,460
like, the knowledge I'm about to give you right now is the ball, and you're leaning down right

228
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,179
in front of it, like as on the opposing team. And I'm gonna... I'm gonna kick this ball, like you're

229
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:56,340
like a foot away from the ball, and I'm kicking it right into your face. That's the knowledge.

230
00:45:57,139 --> 00:46:15,860
There's a lot of ways to go. How do I get that one? John... John... I get to go around and then drop

231
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:42,179
down to get that one, don't I? Damn it. Go up and then down. But where? But where? Wait, this one right

232
00:46:42,179 --> 00:47:06,659
here. Wait a minute. How do I do this? And they said it couldn't be done. But I want to get that

233
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:21,929
other one too. How far? Oh, this is too much. Did everything do this? Uh, no. I feel like that's the

234
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:44,219
progression route. Hold on. What is this way? Nothing. Is there anything? Can I go out? I'm just

235
00:47:44,219 --> 00:48:07,929
curious. I just need to know. Up there. Wait a second here. Hold on. One gosh darn second. Can I

236
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:33,849
get through? Can I get up there like this? Wow. Oh, I can. You gotta go up. Okay, I get it. And then

237
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:42,090
you have to go down. Straight up. Straight up again. No, and then down this way. And then across.

238
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:57,639
John, darling, slow down. Who said that? This is, this is progression. Ah, fuck it is.

239
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:11,860
Boom. I'm simply a concerned observer. You can tell the reason because I have red eyes. Are you

240
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:25,110
me? I'm a part of you. Why would part of me look so creepy? It's just what I look like, okay?

241
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:35,579
Deal with it. Sorry, I didn't. Forget about it. I can't tell you what a relief it is to finally get

242
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:42,710
out of here. But look, I'm worried about it. We need a hobby, but this. I know it sounds crazy,

243
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:49,059
but I need to climb this mountain. You are many things, darling, but you're not a mountain climber.

244
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:57,079
Not in a fucking million years. Who says I can't be? I know it's not your strong suit,

245
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:02,039
but be reasonable for once, you fucking idiot. You have no idea what you're getting into.

246
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,800
You can't even handle it. This is exactly why I need to do this. Okay, I'm done doing this.

247
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:19,079
Are you the weak part of me or the lazy part? I'm the pragmatic body. And I'm trying to be

248
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:36,940
diplomatic here. Let's go home together. Well, not anymore. Do I have to run away? Can I attack?

249
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:43,320
Dashing doesn't do anything. I can't. Okay, I just tried to goomba. Goomba doesn't work. What about

250
00:50:43,320 --> 00:51:03,980
skeleton? Oh shit, I'm running out of energy. Wait, I need that. Shit. I can get it. I got it

251
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:26,570
already. Good. How do I get it? How do you get this? Can I break the wall? Oh, fuck. How do I get

252
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:35,769
over there? I can't get that. That's some secret. I'll have to figure it out like on a third playthrough.

253
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:50,230
Go in the door? I can't go in a door? Door. That's not gonna work. Can't open that?

254
00:51:52,760 --> 00:52:08,869
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. What the heck? I thought I had to touch it again.

255
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:21,219
I don't. Okay, hold on. I can do twice. I can do two dashings. I didn't know I could go for

256
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:24,739
the spikes. All right. All right. All right. I thought I was gonna die hitting the spikes there.

257
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:51,619
Dummy. I had it the first time. Oh my god. Do you know what I wish I could see

258
00:52:51,619 --> 00:53:01,670
with this game? Definitely a speed run. Okay. I fucking shut up and play. I'm doing so bad.

259
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:28,199
No, fuck. I gotta get that one first. Oh, fuck. Oh my god. All right. Hold on. I need a sip of

260
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:42,679
coffee. You have to bait and then dash. You don't get it all in one go. I gotta dash this fucking

261
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:57,429
thing. I'm literally just outplaying myself. I really am. You idiot! What do I do? Holy shit,

262
00:53:57,429 --> 00:54:02,789
I'm so stupid. What's happening? Slow down. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

263
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:29,530
What's wrong with me? Why is it three? You gotta go real fast to get this one.

264
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:52,360
You know what I would love to see with this game? No, I have to get it. I have to.

265
00:54:55,190 --> 00:55:26,840
Wait a minute. Hold on. Oh, so they're not chasing me. Now I am unbeatable.

266
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:32,380
You stay here for a second and then... I already got it. What the fuck am I doing? I already have

267
00:55:32,380 --> 00:56:03,019
it. All right. Everyone just stand still. I just stared into the microphone. Yeah. Please, God.

268
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:39,739
What? Go, go! Come on. I don't know what to do. Fall? Holy shit. Oh, I had it. Oh, fuck. All right.

269
00:56:39,739 --> 00:57:08,119
Get ready. Get up. I'm trying to do a double jump. Fall. Fall. Fall. Fall. Go. Oh, you stupid.

270
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:29,000
Idiot. You deserve to be punched. Oh, you don't. You missed it. You missed it. But it's okay. You

271
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:58,199
can miss it. Oh, my God. Again, I'm shaking. I'm not shaking. I'm fine. Up. Go around. There's four

272
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:04,280
of them. What? I thought there was only three. Three. What's inside that cube? I don't think

273
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:38,949
we're ever going to find out. We gotta wait for them all to go by. You idiot. Let's do it. Oh,

274
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:52,440
fuck me. All right. This time, wait till they all go underneath. Holy shit. What have I done? No,

275
00:58:52,440 --> 00:59:19,349
no. You gotta just... How did I do that? What do I grab? Go back. Is there anything over here?

276
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:45,500
Wait. Should I go up? No other secrets or anything? No, no. No more ways to go. There is

277
00:59:45,500 --> 01:00:02,010
another way to go. There's a secret over here. There's so many ways to go. Uh oh. Now I'm in

278
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:18,340
trouble. There's so much to do. I'm so dumb. You gotta go diagonal. Should have went through.

279
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:39,000
Like that. All right. Give me the berry. No other secrets? Not that I can see. So much to do. So

280
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,940
much to see. What's wrong with taking the back seat, you know? Sometimes you have to.

281
01:00:47,340 --> 01:01:00,309
Nothing. What about over here? This looks breakable. All right. We have a coin center.

282
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:12,550
Answer the phone. Why am I doing this to you? What are you talking about? I'm just checking for

283
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:19,860
secrets. What? I'm not allowed to check for secrets? John, are you calling from a payphone?

284
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:29,769
Yep. No, wait. You called me. What are you talking about? It doesn't matter. I'm in trouble.

285
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:36,500
I'm being chased by someone. I don't really understand what's going on, but I know I'm in

286
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:43,449
danger. I can feel it. John, you only call me when you're panicking in the middle of the night.

287
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,889
You don't have to make up some ridiculous story just to get my attention.

288
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:57,849
Not making it up. You always do this. It's all right. Calm down. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Talk to me.

289
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:06,730
I'm climbing Celeste Mountain. I found this old mirror and it shattered, but part of me escaped.

290
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:17,699
And I'm dreaming, aren't I? John, of course you're dreaming. I haven't spoken to you in months.

291
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:23,500
Why would I start now? Why am I even climbing this stupid mountain?

292
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,989
I'm wondering the same thing. It's time to give up and go home.

293
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:55,670
First boss. Thanks for playing. Wait, I didn't even do it? Wait, I have to do this?

294
01:02:55,670 --> 01:03:16,809
Now I do the real level? I have to do it again? Is it fall damage? No. Interesting though. Look,

295
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:25,750
can I go over here? I can. Okay. I don't even remember his name. If you paid me a thousand

296
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:29,110
dollars right now and told me to save this guy's name and you get a thousand dollars in cash,

297
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:46,889
I wouldn't be able to do it. Thane? Is it Thane? Hey John, you made it. Climbing up here was tough,

298
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:59,460
but totally worth it. Just look at those ruins. I took so many great picks. Want to see?

299
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:06,840
Thane. Is that why I'm thinking that? Because somebody said Thane last night? Last night? It's

300
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:16,260
been like four days. I don't- my brain sometimes has problems remembering things. Oh sure. Last

301
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:25,019
night. I was sick, okay? I'm sick right now. Theo. There it was. Thane. I have two letters.

302
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:31,699
And no, three letters actually. The T, the H, and the E. Maybe I'll finally hit a thousand

303
01:04:31,699 --> 01:04:40,659
followers with these. But we need to formally commemorate this occasion. Take a selfie with me.

304
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:46,260
I don't take selfies. I hate them. I hate pictures. I don't like pictures. I don't like selfies.

305
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:59,239
Guys, a selfie is just a permanent looking in the mirror. You might- I don't want that. Every

306
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:06,889
selfie is just the way that you look at yourself in the mirror. You want like four hundred thousand

307
01:05:06,889 --> 01:05:13,750
of those on your phone? I don't know if that's such a good idea.

308
01:05:17,269 --> 01:05:33,539
Come on, it's easy. Like this. See? What's a regular picture of you then? A photo?

309
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:41,460
No, everybody does the same thing when they take a selfie. I'll show you.

310
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:49,380
So anyways, forget about how fucking bad this hair is today. And yes, I've got a Death Star

311
01:05:49,380 --> 01:06:00,119
t-shirt on. The Death Star. People have made jokes before about how my whole wardrobe is Star Wars

312
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:07,219
related. I've just- over the years, I've just- I have probably 12 to 15 Star Wars shirts.

313
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:15,239
It's bad. They're just so easy. Look, Disney bought Star Wars. So at this point,

314
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:21,369
it's everywhere. You can't get away from Star Wars. So there's like a 10% chance that 10%

315
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:26,500
of your clothing has to be Star Wars related. Is it? Is 10% of your guys clothes Star Wars related?

316
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:42,389
Are you sure? Go into your t-shirts. Are we certain about this? Anyways, what's your

317
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:50,900
guys name? Thane? What was I just doing? Why did I turn the camera on? Oh, right, right, right.

318
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:58,150
Selfie. Okay. So when you take a photo, you are locking away a memory, right? Because you want to

319
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:01,110
take a photo and you want to make sure you preserve it and remember it. So, you know,

320
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:07,539
you're like, oh, it's me and some friends. Like, okay, like, cool. Okay, nice. You got it? Nice.

321
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:11,059
Hey, remember that time we went to, uh, Las Vegas? Yeah, here's a photo.

322
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:15,139
A selfie is just the way you look at yourself in the mirror. You go like this.

323
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:20,889
Ready? You tell me how this is any different than any selfie you've ever fucking seen in your life.

324
01:07:30,969 --> 01:07:39,349
It's fucking stupid. Don't take him anymore. You need to smile. No, nobody does that. Look.

325
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:53,960
Yes, they do. No, they don't. Okay. If somebody links me one photo of a selfie of somebody smiling,

326
01:07:54,519 --> 01:07:59,880
I will eat a thousand dollars. All right. Let's fucking go. Sorry about that. Don't worry. I

327
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:15,269
won't post that one. No, it's all right. You can post it. It was a joke. It was a fucking bit.

328
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:24,359
No, no, stop. That was, I'm kidding. No one links. No, I, I banned, I'm, links are banned.

329
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:34,359
Also, one other thing before we move on. I know people are probably like, oh, go back to fucking

330
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:42,390
Celeste. But listen, why is it? Every picture I ever take when I'm trying to smile, it's like pain.

331
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:47,270
I can't do it. I can't fucking smile in a photo because it takes too long. I'm right now like,

332
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:51,029
I'm like, we're like having some fun. We're like smiling and laughing and stuff. This is like fun.

333
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:56,470
We're having a good time, right? Well, I'm smiling. If I take a photo of me smiling, it always looks

334
01:08:56,470 --> 01:09:05,699
like this every single fucking time, no matter what I do. I don't fucking understand. Why does

335
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:14,229
this happen? And even when I think it looks good in my mind, I'm like, oh, all right. Like,

336
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:20,869
hey, this is fun. We're having a good time. And I look at the photo and I zoom. Everybody does this.

337
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:25,430
You zoom in. Hey, can I see that for a second? Let me see. Like you took a photo. You took like

338
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:31,529
a group photo. Let me see. Let me see how it looks. Let me see my fucking face. God damn it.

339
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:45,300
Don't be so hard on yourself. Okay. Fine. I won't. No one looks good without a filter.

340
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:57,130
It's true. Show the automaton. Me on the right. Yeah.

341
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:05,640
Casual yet refined. Any more things this guy needs to tell me? What made you want to try

342
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:11,319
photography? My grandpa was really into it. Apparently. Do it again. I wasn't looking.

343
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:16,039
You lost your opportunity. Rewind 15 seconds. Apparently he was semi-famous in the photography

344
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:22,819
world. I don't know if I'll ever be that good. But it's nice to feel close to him. So you're

345
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:30,010
determined to climb the entire mountain. Yeah, I told myself I would. I'm done breaking promises

346
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:36,649
to myself. And the stream. I've told you Dreamcast is coming for like six months.

347
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,609
And I keep telling you, oh, we're going to do that like next weekend. I keep breaking it.

348
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:45,289
I gotta stop doing that. Life goals. I dig it. I doubt I'll make it to the top like you,

349
01:10:45,289 --> 01:10:50,859
but I'm not ready to turn back just yet. Are you getting any data up here?

350
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:53,260
I don't have a smartphone.

351
01:10:55,029 --> 01:11:05,560
John, I don't even know how to respond to that. All right. Bye. How do I like jump and like karate

352
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:15,800
kick the support of this 10 and heavenly? Nevermind. That's mean. Well, let's go. I'm

353
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:23,460
going to go to the left. I'm going to go underneath. I'm going to go up through and drill under.

354
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,920
All right. That didn't do anything. It was just there for fun. So let's just go.

355
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:49,560
This is not a secret unless no, you know, sometimes I have complaints about controls.

356
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:56,090
Like, I don't know if I got to tell you when I press B and I don't move it, I pressed it very

357
01:11:56,090 --> 01:12:08,649
tight. I've not had one real complaint about the controls of the game, but I am going to

358
01:12:08,649 --> 01:12:11,930
continue to accidentally meet boy. It's going to happen for the rest of the entire stream.

359
01:12:12,489 --> 01:12:31,930
Secret. Oh yeah. Where's the joystick? Got you. Not allowed to dash, but you sure can. If you

360
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:43,140
grab it, are we ever going to find out what's in the cube? Oh, are you, you want to know what's

361
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:56,149
in the cube? Oh, okay. All right. So what I'm thinking is I think Epic is now, do I actually

362
01:12:56,149 --> 01:13:17,420
make a phone call? It says mom. Hi mom. John, what a nice surprise. How does your trip? It's okay.

363
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:22,699
I'm just kind of overwhelmed. Oh no. Are you having another panic attack? Focus on your breathing,

364
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:40,229
honey. I'm here. What's going on? I picked up the phone. But what if inside the cube is another

365
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:51,079
cube? Well, then Peter Molyneux is going to have a lot of explaining to do. Six out of 18. I did.

366
01:13:52,359 --> 01:14:04,890
Oh wait, hold on. I want to go look at that. What is this? B side. Old site, black moonrise mix, music.

367
01:14:09,829 --> 01:14:14,470
So it's you. So it's just a different, oh boy, hold on. This is different.

368
01:14:17,539 --> 01:14:33,050
Ow. This is just a secondary fun mode. Figured it out in 10 seconds. That's all I needed.

369
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:46,180
That's all I needed. I'll get it. I'll get it. I just might control it.

370
01:14:46,180 --> 01:15:06,069
Control. Something about the control. Jump. Yeah. What do you mean jump? Why is it going to jump?

371
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:10,869
Jump. That's what I'm doing, isn't it? Just jump.

372
01:15:11,829 --> 01:15:39,939
Hmm. Oh, shit. Well, okay. Come on. Do it. Oh, shit. I gotta go faster than that.

373
01:15:46,439 --> 01:16:10,979
Ooh. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I had it. Had it. I'm gonna go straight up to this one.

374
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:41,829
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Oh, that's it. No, no. You blew it again. I can't. I got it. I just regular jump.

375
01:16:42,789 --> 01:17:04,659
Fuck. I'm gonna do it straight up. There's the question though is how in the heck you gotta

376
01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:11,800
just grab a B. I get it. You gotta grab and don't dash. You need to jump around. How the fuck am I

377
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:25,449
gonna do that? Because you gotta go like this. I'm so annoyed at that. Not the game myself.

378
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:36,060
I mean, I'm pressing A. Pretty clear. Shut up and play. Okay. Who am I talking to?

379
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:55,500
All right. I'm losing it here. I'm hitting the ceiling. I'm not doing it fast enough in there.

380
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:07,109
I'm so dumb. I can get it. It's fine. Come on. Recharge. Recharge. Whoa. Whoa. Wait. Okay. Hold

381
01:18:07,109 --> 01:18:17,189
on. Oh, fuck. What do we got? Oh, no. Not one of these. Not one of these. I don't want to do this.

382
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:26,279
So, we gotta go through up. Oh, man. I gotta block this out. Maybe jump up here first

383
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:39,430
and then hold on. Oh, maybe. Cookie CRM with 10 community subs. Thank you, Cookie.

384
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:56,949
How do I get up there? The real question actually. Oh, come on. Really?

385
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:10,500
You do have to get that one first. It's the yeah. Do I have the extension turned on or is this part

386
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:24,329
of the game? Shit. I gotta go at an angle down that way. I actually should probably get this one

387
01:19:24,329 --> 01:19:37,859
first and then go to the middle. No, go from left to right. This one straight up and then into the

388
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:47,750
corner. Into the corner. Get out. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Now what? Oh, fuck. Straight up.

389
01:19:48,550 --> 01:20:04,539
Looks like it. Whoa. Yep. Oh, this is gonna be tough. You gotta hit that while you're going in.

390
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:16,760
I don't know where to go from there, though. What? Hold on. How does this end?

391
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:28,550
And then back up. I am so confused. Hold on. Through the whole thing? Okay. All right. All right.

392
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:39,829
Oh, it did. I angled it wrong. I didn't mean to angle it. Sometimes it just angles.

393
01:20:40,630 --> 01:21:11,340
That's it. There's a lot to this. All right. At least the clone is gone.

394
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:32,060
Left. Left jump up. You idiot. I had it. Again, I didn't mean to do that.

395
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:39,979
I didn't mean to do that either. Fucking Meat Boy. I should have never played Meat Boy.

396
01:21:40,859 --> 01:22:16,619
More. Up. Up and then up and down to the bottom right and then walk. I don't know. We're gonna

397
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:41,369
have to just do it. Go down maybe. Oh, fuck me. Whoa. Okay. Hold on. So I gotta get that one last.

398
01:22:42,789 --> 01:22:59,699
All right. Go up. What are you doing? I really think you have to get this one last. For some

399
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:09,619
reason, I'm a moron and I'm getting it. Shit. I'm doing this in the wrong order.

400
01:23:10,579 --> 01:23:33,189
Like that. That much is absolutely certain. I fucked it up again. Why? You have to go. I have

401
01:23:33,189 --> 01:23:40,199
to go from the top left to the bottom right. So get the top left one last. I mean, I guess it

402
01:23:40,199 --> 01:24:23,340
doesn't really matter, does it? Shit. That's not the right one. I gotta get up there. Trying to

403
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:31,850
bait them. No. Sometimes the controller really does make me go the direction I don't want to go.

404
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:46,649
What are you doing? Shit. That was it. I had it. I just didn't do it fucking far enough.

405
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:24,149
Oh my god. Give me a break. Why? I had it again. At least I have a pattern down that I can reliably

406
01:25:24,149 --> 01:26:10,119
do. Got it. So somebody just said, if this is end game content, what am I doing this for?

407
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:31,180
I just have to hold it. Because you're a troll. Is this like bonus end game kind of shit?

408
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:52,520
Fuck. So what you're saying is I'm going to get like this stuff out of the way. Come on,

409
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:59,350
you can do it. And effectively I'm doing some of the harder mission. Okay, that's cool.

410
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:18,579
It's really fun. Down and now what? If I go, I guess I did it like that. But

411
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:25,159
what's the up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. I had it. What am I doing?

412
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:46,710
I forgot about the spikes. Stupid. I don't know why I'm trying to go left there.

413
01:27:55,979 --> 01:28:17,659
No, there's more. How much more is there? I just like, what's going on here? Down,

414
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:55,770
diagonal, diagonal. Hold on. I got caught there. Hold on. I'm literally pressing up.

415
01:28:57,829 --> 01:29:03,189
All right. Okay. So I can dash right at the last second before I hit these spikes.

416
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:33,220
Holy shit. Okay. I got to grab the wall. Shit. Oh man. All right. So it's hold the wall,

417
01:29:33,220 --> 01:30:00,970
go, dash, upright, bottom right, up, left, and then grab the wall. Damn. Shit. I don't have any more.

418
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:21,909
Oh no. So I, I got to jump out of this one, right? Really? What's that? You saw me dash? I

419
01:30:21,909 --> 01:30:50,020
dashed off into it. Meat boy, quit fucking me. That came out. Meat boy. No. I wonder.

420
01:30:50,020 --> 01:31:01,270
Can you straight up? Yep. Straight up. And then what? That's the real question.

421
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:12,180
Holy shit. I didn't even get to see that part. So hold on. Up, up, up,

422
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:27,029
top left, top right. Just play the main game. Yeah. I kind of just accidentally clicked on this,

423
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:37,130
didn't I? He's going to finish this and he's going to breeze through the campaign.

424
01:31:42,409 --> 01:31:47,460
I am. Maybe I shouldn't be like muscle memory learning how to do all this.

425
01:31:48,100 --> 01:32:05,079
There are no checkpoints on B-side. Really? Jesus. Wait a minute. My goodness. Um,

426
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:10,859
at least I can see that now. I already passed the checkpoint. I did.

427
01:32:21,189 --> 01:32:32,039
Now I'm trying to rush it. I'm trying to rush it. I'm not even trying to rush it. If you

428
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:39,609
quit a chapter, you lose all. How close am I to finishing this? How many more are after this?

429
01:32:41,029 --> 01:32:49,699
How is that not working? I probably should start using the D-pad. That's going to happen

430
01:32:49,699 --> 01:32:53,539
over and over again. Now I'm using the D-pad and it's still working. It's still happening.

431
01:32:54,180 --> 01:33:23,779
Okay. Both very close. No, I would agree with you, but I am using an Xbox one controller,

432
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:28,819
which as you know, the D-pad is one giant button. It's the worst D-pad of any controller.

433
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:36,300
If you press up on an Xbox one control, you're pressing like all of the top of the whole

434
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:48,420
control. You might as well be pressing every face button, dude. All right. Come on. I can do this.

435
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:06,300
Arrow keys. Yeah, but you can. So irritating. Uh, arrow keys. Sure. But then you actually,

436
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:09,979
you have to play with the keyboard, which is, uh, I can't. It's un-variable for me.

437
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:23,930
Dammit. What the hell do I do when I get there? Do I have to go grab on to the, okay,

438
01:34:24,729 --> 01:34:34,420
through top left, grab the ledge and then drew top right. Let's try it. I can get there.

439
01:34:41,479 --> 01:34:47,000
Oh, I got to go through there. Oh, I had it. Oh, that sucks. No.

440
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:55,850
Shit. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it.

441
01:34:56,489 --> 01:35:04,140
I'm not going to fall through that damn thing. What the hell am I going to do about that?

442
01:35:04,779 --> 01:35:21,609
I tried to jump out of it. Just didn't do it. Why is it not jumping out?

443
01:35:22,329 --> 01:35:31,270
Is there a reason why that's not happening? I keep trying to jump out of there.

444
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:51,640
Holy shit. All right. Come on. That's it, right? This is it. This has to be it.

445
01:35:52,039 --> 01:36:00,119
I'm on level one. I'm on level two of the actual campaign. All right. What do I need to do?

446
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:14,920
Why did I open this? I guess we're going to go straight up.

447
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:33,619
Get that one. The left. I got to just do it. I can't just peek. Holy shit. What the hell

448
01:36:33,619 --> 01:36:56,899
did I just do to myself? I didn't jump. Um, well, hold on. I got it. I got it. I got it.

449
01:36:56,899 --> 01:37:01,539
So then we're going to jump over, fall through. Hold on. Hold on now.

450
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:08,899
Through. Hold it. Hold on now. What do I do now? What happened? No, I had to, what does it,

451
01:37:08,899 --> 01:37:15,770
where does it go? What the fuck was that? It makes a wall. So I gotta, I gotta go from there

452
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:33,670
and diagonal up to the right. Shit. All right. I had it. Got it. Now let's just make sure I get

453
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:53,130
this correct. Let's do it. Let's finish this damn thing. That's high. Um, uh, so I'm going to get

454
01:37:53,130 --> 01:38:00,149
a start on the right screen. Left. I think we just have to go back and forward. Grab that one. You

455
01:38:00,149 --> 01:38:20,090
get a dash again. I got to get that jump down. I wonder, can you just queue it up inside? No,

456
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:32,970
it has to be right on the left, doesn't it? Damn. I guess I'm going to do it that way.

457
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:41,989
Maybe not. Can I just go, I can just go up. I mean, maybe that's going to be tough.

458
01:38:51,340 --> 01:39:01,510
No, no way. I mean, maybe, maybe. Hold on. If I just jump up the normal way. Okay. No, I can do

459
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:09,779
that. I have to jump out of that, which is the biggest pain in the ass for me is trying to get

460
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:30,489
the jump. Okay. Where does that go? Oh, come on. What, where does it go? Give me the stupid

461
01:39:30,489 --> 01:39:41,800
fucking skull thing. What does it drop? It drops down there. What's the point of this?

462
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:46,819
I don't know. What's the point of this? Why don't I just leave? Can I just leave?

463
01:39:50,470 --> 01:40:15,239
What does that do for me? Can jump. So unreliable for me. And so that makes spikes all the way down.

464
01:40:16,279 --> 01:40:36,699
Come on. I don't get what, what's the point of putting it down? Jesus.

465
01:40:36,699 --> 01:40:50,409
I guess maybe I'll just grab onto it. Why is the jump so unreliable?

466
01:40:53,500 --> 01:41:16,149
I'm doing it at the same time, every time. Oh my God. What am I doing? What the fuck?

467
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:43,819
I'm so confused. So straight through and then up, up. Yeah. And then I got to go back down

468
01:41:43,819 --> 01:42:14,060
and around the whole damn thing. I guess maybe not curious of how the hell this plays out.

469
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:27,850
I can only look at it again because it seems like that's not the right thing to do. So I grab onto

470
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:38,220
the, it comes down and I grab onto it. I have to go to the top left or maybe I could just go back.

471
01:42:38,220 --> 01:42:40,460
Why would I go back to the, yeah. So I got to go top left.

472
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:54,329
Okay. All right. All right. Straight right. I feel you. Now I'm just rushing because my brain

473
01:42:54,890 --> 01:43:24,170
is scrambled eggs. All right. Here we go. Oh, fuck. Um, um, oh, I dodged. No, fuck. Oh, hi.

474
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:38,649
That was it. I got it. I'm sorry. I had, I didn't, I thought I hit the wall. That's why I freaked out

475
01:43:38,649 --> 01:43:53,590
because I didn't, I didn't have control. I like, I took my, I'm brushing again. I got it. It's over.

476
01:43:53,590 --> 01:43:59,989
I beat it. I mean, it's a fucking pain in the ass, but I did. All right. Would you slow down?

477
01:43:59,989 --> 01:44:36,569
You did it. You know what to do. Just finish it. Bingo. Anything else? I guess we just gotta

478
01:44:36,569 --> 01:45:23,479
go straight up. Just get, just pick it up. Black moon ride. What does that mean? What do I get

479
01:45:23,479 --> 01:45:48,810
for doing that? Side complete. So what does that do? Times. I get 199. I hate that. I wish I died

480
01:45:48,810 --> 01:46:05,050
one more time. Go back and die again. Okay. Well that was cool. I like that because that was,

481
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:10,649
okay. So that was challenging, but it wasn't impossible. It was just challenging and fun.

482
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:23,180
He's so early in the game. I know. I, I don't know why I did it. It was fun.

483
01:46:23,180 --> 01:46:36,229
Celestial resort. Chapter three. It wasn't dog shit impossible. Yeah. Sometimes games like this

484
01:46:36,229 --> 01:46:45,510
just make it dog shit impossible for you. Be proud of your death count. The more you die,

485
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:56,869
the more you're learning. Keep going. Yeah, that's true. Hey, welcome back to the regular game.

486
01:46:57,670 --> 01:47:08,539
It all feels so easy now. Look, I just have to walk. That's great. Look at how easy it is to avoid

487
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:22,680
mold. Wait, can I get on the roof? You're going to die more times here than the last level.

488
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:41,720
Just saying. Really? Got a berry. Don't I die. It's okay. Let's just start here. I'm going to,

489
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:48,220
yeah, I'm probably going to go up here. Why not? I guess I do have to get up there somehow.

490
01:47:49,180 --> 01:48:21,239
Hmm. Oh, fuck. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, look at that. I cheated.

491
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:30,439
I'm still cheating by the way. The dash just resets upon exiting. And yeah, that's cool.

492
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:51,619
Picking up berries. Any more? 17. Ooh, a key. Oh, that's not that exciting. It opens this door.

493
01:48:52,819 --> 01:49:13,739
I was going to say, cool secret. What else is up here? Berry. Well, I probably have to go

494
01:49:13,739 --> 01:49:20,649
inside and then left for this one. I got the secret fucking key. That's right. And I said the F word.

495
01:49:20,649 --> 01:49:29,140
I'm sorry. This is kind of like the last level in DuckTales. The last boss room when you fight

496
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:37,720
Dracula. Oddly specific, I know. I'm sorry. That's just the way it is. Please ring for service.

497
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:55,319
I'm wasting the battery on my automaton. Welcome. May I help you? Are you a ghost?

498
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:00,840
Ghost? Don't be silly. I am the concierge of this fine establishment.

499
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:12,260
Welcome to the world-renowned Celestial Resort Hotel. Mr. Oshiro at your service.

500
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:20,149
Two guests in one day. This is finally picking up. How long will you be staying with us?

501
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:25,220
Oh, I'm just passing through. I'm climbing the mountain. Do you have a back exit?

502
01:50:26,979 --> 01:50:36,520
A back exit. Just passing through. This will not do. You know, I can still hear you. Right.

503
01:50:38,439 --> 01:50:44,220
In any case, our rear service door is reserved for hotel staff only. However, our top floor

504
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:49,579
presidential suite features a wide class view of the peak. Yes, you'll be quite comfortable up there.

505
01:50:50,460 --> 01:51:00,460
Why am I hearing phone signal sounds? I don't know. I'm not hearing those.

506
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:05,699
Maybe I could get on the roof from there and climb down the back.

507
01:51:06,659 --> 01:51:10,899
Presidential suite. Marvelous idea, Oshiro. What is your name for our records?

508
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:15,140
I'm John. But again, I'm really not interested in staying.

509
01:51:17,050 --> 01:51:29,989
Right this way. Ms. John. I can ring it again. What's this? Very old dusty guest book. Many of

510
01:51:29,989 --> 01:51:37,289
the pages are damaged or missing. The comments, however, are glowing. We'll never forget our time

511
01:51:37,289 --> 01:51:51,100
here. I've never felt more at peace. Thank you. Okay. Does it come back? Nope. All right. Get it

512
01:51:51,100 --> 01:52:10,279
easy for me. Yeah. Yep. This ball. I don't think it does. So Barry, I'm going to, I can jump down.

513
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:28,489
Bradbury dash left. Okay. That would hurt. I need like take a break.

514
01:52:29,770 --> 01:52:33,529
That hurt. It really did. Some weight is involved in this one.

515
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:39,930
Okay. This was curious how it worked. I can put extra weight on it. They could go faster.

516
01:52:41,850 --> 01:52:46,970
Didn't even need the other dash. Did I get too good at the game to not need that dash?

517
01:52:47,130 --> 01:53:00,859
Is there such a thing? Secret. Oh, wait, what's down here? This is going to go all the way to the left,

518
01:53:00,859 --> 01:53:09,560
right and out the door. Did I just skip everything? No. Don't, don't get a big head about this.

519
01:53:10,359 --> 01:53:17,029
So that's just the way back. Okay. I didn't even know that was there.

520
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:42,069
Too lazy. More community subs. Why did I end up here? It's just a great Canadian thing.

521
01:53:43,479 --> 01:53:47,880
A great Canadian fuck club. Thanks for the 10 community subs. There's been a shit load

522
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:59,720
tonight. There's been like 50 or 60 community subs tonight, hasn't there? Thanks a lot guys.

523
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:22,100
Seriously. Did I miss a secret? So much mold. Oh, okay. Well, let's check a, let's check a look

524
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:31,000
over here. Another tape. I ain't doing that one. I'll do that one. I'll do that one like next week.

525
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:42,659
How do I even attempt to do this? Do it now. I can't, I can't even go that way.

526
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:48,819
I'm going to pee my pants. All right. Just all right. Let me pee my pants and then we'll get

527
01:54:48,819 --> 01:54:57,350
going. It's always after two hours. It's two hours on the mark every time. Right before I leave,

528
01:54:57,350 --> 01:55:05,609
DEDO, DEDO, thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you for your like 75 community subs in the

529
01:55:05,609 --> 01:55:14,869
first hour and a half of the stream. Two hours. You guys are too generous. I'll be right back. I'm

530
01:55:14,869 --> 01:58:14,039
just going to pee. Hi there. How you doing? Grab some water too, because you need to hydrate when

531
01:58:14,039 --> 01:58:22,119
you're playing video games. How's the audio too? Am I too soft, too loud? I feel like I might need

532
01:58:22,119 --> 01:58:40,180
to drop the audio a little bit in the game. Maybe like, maybe like by 2%. How's that? Better?

533
01:58:40,819 --> 01:58:49,260
That's probably a little better. Yeah. I'm, I'm never loud enough for some crazy reason. I don't

534
01:58:49,260 --> 01:59:13,479
know why. All right. We're good. Okay. There's a little spot to fall down there. Ah, it's going

535
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:17,960
to take me all, all the way to the left. It's going to be the thing that I need to get guaranteed.

536
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:33,369
Oh, I didn't see that meatball there. There it is. BRB, my McAfee antivirus needs to update.

537
01:59:34,170 --> 01:59:48,619
Why do you have McAfee? Is it, is that, is that like an all the way to the left best buy computer?

538
01:59:49,340 --> 02:00:04,329
Cause they all have McAfee on them. Oh, he's getting political. So that takes us to the key.

539
02:00:04,329 --> 02:00:20,260
Then we got to go down. Oh, I stepped on it. Cool. Got the two berries in there.

540
02:00:23,529 --> 02:00:34,279
I tried to rush it and that's what happened. The music is changing. Oh, what about,

541
02:00:34,279 --> 02:00:39,770
can I hold these? Oh, no, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see. Did they ever go back down?

542
02:00:40,649 --> 02:00:47,500
I don't think they do, but it's okay. I don't even need them.

543
02:00:48,380 --> 02:01:10,359
Well, I might, I actually might need them. Oh, what am I doing? Same deal. Got to go across.

544
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:19,619
All right. Oh, I wait, I can go up there. I want to go up there. I think I want to go up there.

545
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:47,289
So I need the dash. So how am I going to do that to not dash? I just waited a little too long.

546
02:01:47,449 --> 02:02:04,520
Oof. Ah, that was it too. Shit. Grab on the edge and just climb and jump. Got it. All right.

547
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:22,119
What's up here? Berry. I didn't even see the thing at the top. Didn't even look. Well, I have to have

548
02:02:22,119 --> 02:02:38,100
a dash. So you have to fall in dash. Got it. No shit. You got to grab the edge. Jeremy, Jeremy.

549
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:53,560
Okay. Go. Any more dialogue for me? Please follow me closely, Miss John. The elevator is just down

550
02:02:53,560 --> 02:03:02,069
the hall. The hotel's pretty rough shape. Is it really open for business? Of course we're open.

551
02:03:02,069 --> 02:03:05,670
The Celestial Resort Hotel would never close during prime tourism season.

552
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:20,489
This water is a little, I think it might be time for a filter change on that water.

553
02:03:21,210 --> 02:03:22,810
Uh, my bag? No, thanks. I'll keep it.

554
02:03:25,479 --> 02:03:37,079
Very well. What a peculiar guest. Don't do that. I'm sorry. I forgot. That was a mouth noise.

555
02:03:38,199 --> 02:03:59,960
What are you thinking? What are you thinking? I'm thinking this.

556
02:04:02,869 --> 02:04:15,720
I didn't get that. Do I even need to jump? Probably, yeah. I gotta wait. Oh my god.

557
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:24,500
How can I not do this? Oh my god. What's wrong with me?

558
02:04:26,699 --> 02:04:47,000
This is the moment you have to wait. I don't like waiting. Just wait. The diamond. There has to be

559
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,239
some reason why I did not see that. I don't know why. It was just right in front of me the whole

560
02:04:51,239 --> 02:05:24,789
time. I don't know. I didn't even see it. Locked door. I don't even need the diamonds. Can you

561
02:05:24,789 --> 02:05:34,569
get me my reader setting? I got an idea.

562
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:58,859
So I obviously have to push that all the way to the bottom and then dash back onto it.

563
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:06,140
If I were a gamer, that's what I would be doing right now, but I'm not doing it right now.

564
02:06:06,859 --> 02:06:20,329
I'm just, shouldn't have played the B sites. Shouldn't have played the B sites. I'm not to

565
02:06:20,329 --> 02:06:24,010
go slow. And I was so used to just like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

566
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:42,020
That might be enough. Stupid idiot. What's wrong with you? Got it. Get it. Collect it. Collect it.

567
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:58,699
Thank you. Well, guys, look at this gamer. I played one before. I played a game before. One.

568
02:07:00,810 --> 02:07:04,489
Well, that was really stupid because that's exactly what I had to do. But I used my dash.

569
02:07:05,930 --> 02:07:25,880
Did it again. Fuck. You gotta grab onto the side and jump. I'm so dumb.

570
02:07:31,930 --> 02:07:56,579
Oh shit. Shit. Well, now I get it. You got to skip that one. What the hell am I doing?

571
02:07:56,579 --> 02:08:06,090
Look top left. Look top left. What are you guys doing? What about it? You want to go up there?

572
02:08:18,779 --> 02:08:24,220
Boomer vision. I don't have boomer vision. I just, so this is where you get the super secret one.

573
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:41,210
All right. Hold on. It's one of your powers. There is, all right. There actually is a lot,

574
02:08:42,010 --> 02:09:01,270
there are a lot of ways to go. You gotta go diagonal. Maybe fall this way and then,

575
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:13,270
okay. Ooh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just fall in and dash up. It's that easy. Collect it.

576
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:19,960
I don't want to do this again. Collect it. You're going to make me do this whole thing

577
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:30,920
to prove that I, I mean, ah, I'm not capable. My fucking dirty hair just got in the way.

578
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:59,829
Why don't I just go this way? Well, oh, okay. I'm fine. Fun game. So I did it.

579
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:27,930
Let's just go. Secret down here. Yes, there is. Okay. Wait, I gotta get that key.

580
02:10:28,649 --> 02:10:38,979
Will you get up there? Why is this harder than me doing the thing? Not even hard. I mean,

581
02:10:38,979 --> 02:10:51,579
it was a little hard. I mean, that's where the meat boy powers come in and all. Okay. For a second,

582
02:10:51,579 --> 02:10:54,859
I thought I could stand on the piano and then my brain immediately corrected itself.

583
02:10:55,819 --> 02:11:14,279
I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I can slow down. There's no reason to go that fast.

584
02:11:15,159 --> 02:11:41,590
See, just slow down. There's no reason to go that crazy. Key. Got it. I could go left though.

585
02:11:42,949 --> 02:11:56,100
No, this is the key to the door, right? Oops. It's all right. I can get it again. No, fall.

586
02:11:56,979 --> 02:12:03,579
No. All right. I saw the meatball on the left. I thought I was going to do something for me.

587
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:20,090
I gotta go from the other side. Up top. Wait, but what about down there? That looks really,

588
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:28,250
it looks like I'm supposed to go through that. Doesn't it? There's a lot of secrets in this game.

589
02:12:30,630 --> 02:12:34,630
Ms. Joan, I'm really the most employee to keep up. I'm running a world-class establishment here.

590
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:42,010
I don't have time to wait around for meandering guests. You really don't have to wait for me.

591
02:12:42,010 --> 02:12:48,310
I'm just looking for a way through this place. Oshiro, you idiot. The customer's always right.

592
02:12:49,109 --> 02:12:51,430
Business is finally picking up and you lose your temper.

593
02:12:53,859 --> 02:12:59,699
Of course, Ms. Joan. My sincere apologies. I was out of line. Please feel free to explore

594
02:12:59,699 --> 02:13:18,300
at your leisure. And I will. Right through. I don't like the Tetris room. This is just

595
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:35,060
failed Tetris. This is what it looks like when I play. I don't like it. I obviously need a key.

596
02:13:35,699 --> 02:13:44,630
Where do I go? Ah, I gotta go down? Down? Down again? Down more?

597
02:13:45,590 --> 02:14:00,550
Uh, can't break it. This must turn into something. This must, this is probably a dream level up here,

598
02:14:00,550 --> 02:14:20,229
I would assume. Goddamn maze. Yeah, this is gonna open up. Hello, sir. This clutter is out of control.

599
02:14:21,670 --> 02:14:30,220
When did this happen? I don't even know where to begin. Do you run this place by yourself?

600
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:37,699
You're right, Ms. Joan. I'll never sort this mess out alone. It's hopeless. It's not what I meant.

601
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:43,539
Just breathe. Mr. Ushiro, breathe. It's just a little spring cleaning. Well, more than a little,

602
02:14:43,539 --> 02:14:53,180
but I can now. No. It's a lost cause. I gotta fix this. I gotta fix the Tetris room.

603
02:14:53,899 --> 02:15:06,890
How long you been running the hotel? Quite some time now. Business has been slow. You must really

604
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:21,079
love your work. Oh yes. In the hotel business, our passion is perfecting the delicate art of hospitality.

605
02:15:21,079 --> 02:15:25,880
A truly great hotel lives eternally in the cherished memories of its satisfied guests.

606
02:15:27,079 --> 02:15:40,260
That's the spirit. Now let's get started on this mess. I'm going this way, so we're gonna go this

607
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:51,399
way. Oh, Thane! What's up, man? YOLO! Remember YOLO! Are you a guest here, too? John, I'm so happy to

608
02:15:51,399 --> 02:15:58,810
see you right now. I'm all about spooky mysteries, but this is getting too real.

609
02:15:59,609 --> 02:16:02,970
Have you talked to Mr. Ushiro? I think he could really use some help.

610
02:16:04,409 --> 02:16:11,699
You think? He's a creepy old weirdo. I bet he's cleaning out a nook to hide our bodies as we speak.

611
02:16:13,060 --> 02:16:16,020
I'm gonna crawl through this vent. It's blowing cold air in from outside.

612
02:16:18,890 --> 02:16:23,689
Come on! I was gonna just scream of Captain Falcon, but then I thought I don't think I

613
02:16:23,689 --> 02:16:28,489
can do a Captain Falcon, so I stopped myself halfway through, and that's how it turned out.

614
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:35,370
Mr. Ushiro's troubled, but I don't think he wants to hurt us. He just needs to clean up this mess.

615
02:16:36,170 --> 02:16:45,479
I want to help him. John, that's very sweet, but this is dangerous. We need to get out of here and

616
02:16:45,479 --> 02:16:50,780
call an expert on creepy old dudes. We aren't prepared for this. I think I can get through to

617
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:57,129
him. Well, I mean, you gotta deal with the caramel that's in the dryer right now. Somebody's fucking

618
02:16:58,090 --> 02:17:02,090
doing something weird in there. That's not how you make candy. Actually, I guess you could.

619
02:17:02,969 --> 02:17:10,809
I'll catch up with you later. Man, you're more stubborn than my sister. I thought that was

620
02:17:10,809 --> 02:17:20,459
impossible. Take care of it. You can make candy in a dryer in a controlled environment, and don't

621
02:17:20,459 --> 02:17:41,100
try this at home. Thanks, Thane. I'll see you outside. Wait, there's a spot right here? Yes,

622
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:51,899
there is, but what? I need to get rid of the purple candy. Oh, I get it. I figured out what's

623
02:17:51,899 --> 02:17:56,299
going on here. That all the red, that's all soap. That's like all dirty soap and shit from the dryer

624
02:17:56,540 --> 02:18:01,500
the washing machine that flaps. This is like laundry. I get it. It's like a laundry soap level.

625
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:29,819
Okay, I understand now. Remember that's there because I won't. Am I going the right way? I

626
02:18:29,819 --> 02:18:38,090
think so. How do I get that? I can't jump. I can't dash. How am I supposed to go through that?

627
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:53,930
Oh shit. Okay, hold on. I fell off. I didn't even press the button. I just tripped,

628
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:11,819
but I gotta grab onto the edge. No, no, no. I gotta grab the other edge. That's how you do it,

629
02:19:11,819 --> 02:19:26,120
but come on, man. Stop doing that. You're getting me in trouble. Why just jump over?

630
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:45,340
What am I doing? Meat Boy has ruined my brain. I'm going to assume there's probably a few buttons

631
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:50,459
that I have to press and eventually it's going to take away all the purple, all the green,

632
02:19:50,459 --> 02:19:58,149
all the right. It's going to be like that. I know it is. If anybody says I'm wrong,

633
02:19:58,229 --> 02:20:07,750
dip band. And I'm talking forever. Not like five minutes and no until Twitch TV turns its servers

634
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:27,700
off. There it is. Yep. Folded all the laundry, sorted the laundry. Everybody thought that I

635
02:20:27,700 --> 02:20:32,659
saw a shitload of question marks and a bunch of like a boomer brain and shit like that,

636
02:20:32,659 --> 02:20:37,780
but that actually was laundry. This is water. It got folded and put away. So

637
02:20:38,659 --> 02:21:13,989
I thought, really? My goodness. Cuter. I mean, this is a secret, but is this a secret just showing

638
02:21:13,989 --> 02:22:07,540
me that there's another secret? What are you doing? I don't know. Purple. All right. See,

639
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:09,780
look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

640
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:27,909
Ooh, scattered and lost. Okay. Cool. What is it? Do I, is that a track of a music track?

641
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:34,649
Holy shit. There's another secret. No, that's just an easy way to get back. Okay.

642
02:22:38,969 --> 02:22:44,569
No, wait, wait, wait. Oh boy. Okay. Well, I lost the opportunity to get the berry that was over there.

643
02:22:45,290 --> 02:22:54,969
A secret level is unlocked after four hearts. So I have two of them, right?

644
02:22:55,770 --> 02:23:08,440
Can you die in the water? You can always just replay levels. Yeah, that's true.

645
02:23:12,229 --> 02:23:21,659
Ah, right, right, right. Here's the other secret it was showing me. Computer. All right. The Pico

646
02:23:21,659 --> 02:23:38,309
8. Celeste. Oh no, it's a commander video machine from meat boy. It's, it's a meat boy

647
02:23:38,309 --> 02:24:02,489
commander video machine. Hey, I got a strawberry. Does that count? Or is this a joke? Everything is

648
02:24:02,489 --> 02:24:33,540
meat boy. Can I go to the bottom right? All right. Okay. I can't, I get a, I can't dash.

649
02:24:45,719 --> 02:25:40,180
Come here. I can't climb in this one. I can't climb up. 5,000. What? Got it. Oh,

650
02:25:41,139 --> 02:25:46,200
no, I'm not going to do it. Here's the question. I guess I go like this.

651
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:55,000
I had it. You did it, but you just didn't do it. I had it again, but you just didn't do it again.

652
02:25:55,719 --> 02:26:03,129
Is there a reason why you're doing that? Is this, there's gotta be a reason why he's doing that,

653
02:26:03,129 --> 02:26:25,719
right? So I don't know. Maybe if you look up why he keeps doing that balloons. Okay. That's balloons

654
02:26:25,719 --> 02:26:55,559
are the dash thing. Jump on the frog or the clouds. Yep. What the hell? Just dash and get it. Dash

655
02:26:55,559 --> 02:27:16,379
and get it. All right. Now how much is left in this little mini game here? This is probably it,

656
02:27:16,379 --> 02:27:31,299
right? A thousand. I got to hold onto that. This is the rest of the game. I get it. I get it. I get

657
02:27:31,299 --> 02:27:43,909
it. I get it. I get it. And up here, diagonal thing, though I did it. No, I don't, do I get

658
02:27:43,909 --> 02:27:55,260
something for doing this? Is this like a thing that I'm going to get? I got to get the, you don't get

659
02:27:55,260 --> 02:28:07,430
anything. You don't get anything. It's just a side thing. It's just fun. Oh, okay. It's just the

660
02:28:07,430 --> 02:28:16,500
original game that they made in a game jam. Oh, all right. That's cool. That's why it's all in

661
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:30,940
one of these little computers. Old side. All right. I beat the game. This is it. I win. I beat it.

662
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:47,340
Yeah, I win. Not playable from the main menu. All right. That's cool. Interesting stuff. Finish

663
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:51,819
this or you get your gamer license revoked. No, that's not the real game. I mean, it's the

664
02:28:51,819 --> 02:28:58,170
original. An old paper sticks out from a clutter. Attention, hotel staff. It is my sad duty to

665
02:28:58,170 --> 02:29:02,649
inform you that the Celestial Resort Hotel will close indefinitely following this season due to

666
02:29:02,649 --> 02:29:08,809
circumstances beyond our control. It was an honor to have served alongside you all as we work

667
02:29:08,809 --> 02:29:13,450
tirelessly to ensure that our guests enjoy the most hospitable and memorable experience possible.

668
02:29:14,170 --> 02:29:20,250
I write this with a heavy heart. This hotel has become my home. It's staff and patrons,

669
02:29:20,250 --> 02:29:31,670
my family. I miss you all dearly. He's a ghost. He's a ghost. All right. Well, that's all we can do

670
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:46,600
here. No shit. What do you mean no shit? He could have been like a ghoul. He might have been a ghost.

671
02:29:46,600 --> 02:30:00,680
He could have, I guess he is very clearly a ghost. I gotta get rid of the green. But he might have

672
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:13,020
just been a guy. No, he wasn't a guy. Is there another way up here? Blocked, blocked, blocked,

673
02:30:13,020 --> 02:30:27,620
blocked, blocked, blocked. We have new dialogue. I'm begun cleaning and already I feel a renewed

674
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:33,379
lightness of spirit. That's the power of positive thinking. Actually, I cleared out some of the

675
02:30:33,379 --> 02:30:40,760
clutter for you. Oh yes, thank you. Please relax and let the hotel staff handle it. You fool. You're

676
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:49,959
losing her. Guests don't want to spend their time cleaning. Are you okay? Yeah. This is the finest

677
02:30:49,959 --> 02:30:56,940
hotel you're ever going to visit. How could I let my problems pile up like this? And there's how we

678
02:30:56,940 --> 02:31:07,209
go. One, two, I'll go down. Goodbye. We're looking for green. If I can remove the green, then we

679
02:31:07,209 --> 02:31:18,700
should be fine. That's a chest. I'll try to get it. Wait, are you sure this is a ghost? Maybe he can

680
02:31:18,700 --> 02:31:47,500
just float. Okay. I have to squish myself. I'm just going to grab a hold of this. It's very lucky.

681
02:31:47,500 --> 02:32:02,579
And I got a hole. Ah, you got to go slow. Sometimes the levels are slow. What's that?

682
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:17,690
Oh, when you slow me down, that's when I have a problem. When you take it, when you take me down

683
02:32:17,690 --> 02:32:30,649
a notch and I have to go very slowly. Look at how much of a problem this causes. And I tried to dash

684
02:32:30,649 --> 02:32:52,379
off the screen. I guess, should I have gone down? Nope, it's a secret. Well, gotta get back. So, um,

685
02:32:53,659 --> 02:33:19,879
fuck. I think I have to go all the way around. I don't, why am I doing that? What are you guys doing?

686
02:33:24,950 --> 02:33:49,540
Why? Why? What are you doing? What are you doing? That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any

687
02:33:49,540 --> 02:34:14,819
sense. Who came up with that? You guys are throwing me off. God damn it. I can't jump on those.

688
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:35,829
Stop jumping on them. You threw me off. So hardcore. Don't blame us. Well, when I look over

689
02:34:35,829 --> 02:34:40,950
in my chat and all I see is people talking about how they're fucking farting and shit. Like,

690
02:34:41,510 --> 02:34:52,760
it's going to throw me off a little. It's going to fuck me up a little bit. Just don't touch

691
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:59,059
anything on the ground and then grab this dash, get over here. What the fuck just happened? What?

692
02:34:59,860 --> 02:35:19,340
You guys are fucking kidding me. Pat's fault. Chat's fault. I mean, come on. I mean, look,

693
02:35:19,340 --> 02:35:44,979
it's not chat's fault. It just is. I definitely did not do that correctly at all. I'll take it

694
02:35:44,979 --> 02:36:35,420
though. What are you doing? Oh my God. You guys really going to do this shit? I made it. Left.

695
02:36:35,420 --> 02:36:55,059
Buried. Well, I think I have to. Come on, move. I didn't even press X. I didn't, I swear.

696
02:36:57,739 --> 02:37:09,420
Whatever. Let's just see if I can time this right. Nope. This is like one of the easiest rooms and

697
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:15,750
for some reason I just, I can't do it. I'm so desperately trying to go as fast as I can and

698
02:37:15,750 --> 02:37:19,510
I got meat boy syndrome, which remember, if you don't know what meat boy syndrome is,

699
02:37:20,069 --> 02:37:25,350
it's instead of climbing up, you just launch off the wall. So I have this meat boy syndrome

700
02:37:25,350 --> 02:38:25,370
that I can't get rid of. Dick. No. Fuck. That's it. I had it. Damn. There it is. The Cheshire

701
02:38:25,370 --> 02:38:45,110
Trest. So that gets rid of all those. The Graham one to go. Wasn't there a blockage over here

702
02:38:45,110 --> 02:39:03,319
somewhere? I know there was. All right. For the new viewers that are coming in, you guys really

703
02:39:03,319 --> 02:39:12,149
want this to be the chat experience? Do you want the chat experience? Oh, this is this channel

704
02:39:12,149 --> 02:39:19,670
I've never heard of. Oh, Jerma985. Let me click on his channel and see what he's doing. Celeste.

705
02:39:19,670 --> 02:39:26,069
Okay. Cool. So how's he doing in Celeste? Nope. I almost missed that one. You try to get that one

706
02:39:26,069 --> 02:39:36,250
again. He's farting. I'm farting. I love to fart. Okay. Well, bye. They're going to think you guys

707
02:39:36,250 --> 02:39:54,729
are bots. Do you guys really want to be bots? Like, I barely enjoyed the luxuries that our

708
02:39:54,729 --> 02:40:10,860
hotel has to offer. I don't know, man. Viewers are going up. No, they're not. No, they're not.

709
02:40:10,860 --> 02:40:28,569
They've been the same. You've lost 600. No, I haven't. Have what? Seriously. Seriously. I don't

710
02:40:28,569 --> 02:40:37,940
know what to say. I missed dialogue. One person wrote that and then everybody decided to jump on

711
02:40:37,940 --> 02:40:45,540
and just start grabbing it. She hates you. I don't. I'm sorry. Wait, I thought I couldn't hear that.

712
02:40:47,350 --> 02:40:51,750
Well, I guess because he's a ghost, you can see right through his brain so I can see his words.

713
02:40:52,629 --> 02:41:06,629
I understand. Well, let me take a look. There is this place that just got open.

714
02:41:07,430 --> 02:41:35,559
Didn't I already do this one? No. Stop me for it. Hmm. Ferry. Can I get it without dying?

715
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:59,139
No. That's dash across. Very clear. Very clear. Gonna fall, grab, dash across. Watch. I ran a dash.

716
02:41:59,860 --> 02:42:22,629
See? Fall, dash across, grab. I watched you since Scary Face Cam Fridays. Oh yeah, I remember those.

717
02:42:23,430 --> 02:42:36,940
I do. Shit. Too bad. Scary Face Cam Fridays. I need to pay attention.

718
02:42:53,700 --> 02:43:05,989
Now what? Bring him back. Guys, there's no such thing as Scary Face Cam Fridays.

719
02:43:06,469 --> 02:43:33,209
You know why? Because I'm just... shit. What am I doing? I did it on Saturday. Yeah,

720
02:43:33,209 --> 02:43:49,930
that person's not a true viewer. All right, I'm doing this wrong. No, I fucked it up. Maybe not.

721
02:43:50,649 --> 02:44:20,149
Holy fuck me. I did it. Holy shit. I hate you. I'm so in love. I'm so in love. You know what I mean?

722
02:44:20,149 --> 02:44:36,709
I've rented a fucking juice. I missed the thing that I needed and I rented a juice again.

723
02:44:37,510 --> 02:45:04,459
Fucking ceiling again. Stop hitting the ceiling before I call your parents. I'm calling your

724
02:45:04,459 --> 02:45:38,579
fucking parents. I'm calling both of your parents at the same time on different cell phones. Oh my

725
02:45:38,579 --> 02:45:48,579
god. And then I'm going to get them both on the phone and I'm going to put them both on speaker

726
02:45:48,579 --> 02:46:00,219
and they're going to talk to each other. I'm going to hold one end to the other. I got the game kit.

727
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:21,049
Whatever. Cleaned up the house. Good for me. What's going on here? Oh, this is just a clean room.

728
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:38,860
They're at work. I'm going to call them. There you are. You certainly have a knack for wandering off.

729
02:46:39,739 --> 02:46:46,709
It was tough, but I sorted everything out for you. The Celestial Resort Hotel extends its

730
02:46:46,709 --> 02:46:52,149
gratitude for your assistance. Of course, the staff had the mess under control, Ms. John.

731
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:56,969
Oh, sure. Yeah. How humiliating.

732
02:46:58,969 --> 02:47:03,850
Your pants are unzipped. Actually, thanks for telling me that. Thank you. I'll zip them up.

733
02:47:04,489 --> 02:47:17,829
It's just up the elevator down the hall. Sure. What the heck. Show me the presidential suite.

734
02:47:18,870 --> 02:47:36,389
Sounds lovely. Don't lose her now. I hate it. I hate it. I hate this. This is worse than anything

735
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:57,739
else. I hate this thing you guys are doing. Man, it's amazing here. How's it going with El Creepo?

736
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:03,420
I helped him clean up that huge mess, but he was kind of a jerk. He still thinks he can convince

737
02:48:03,420 --> 02:48:11,030
me to stay. It's gone seriously. My bad idea radar is off the charts on this one. You should get out

738
02:48:11,030 --> 02:48:16,950
of here. Emote only mode has been activated. If I disappear now, Mr. Oshiro could have a meltdown

739
02:48:16,950 --> 02:48:24,069
and maybe I can actually do something good for once. Forget your karma, dude. I think that guy

740
02:48:24,069 --> 02:48:29,930
is going to melt down no matter what. You have to think about your safety. Theo, I'll be okay.

741
02:48:31,079 --> 02:48:34,520
Yeah. Yeah. I didn't expect you to listen. See you on the outside. Jail bird.

742
02:48:44,500 --> 02:49:05,770
Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. First try guaranteed. No. Holy fuck. First try guaranteed.

743
02:49:05,770 --> 02:49:09,770
Nope, not first try. I gotta get. I hate it. I hate the thing you guys are doing right now.

744
02:49:13,770 --> 02:49:33,450
I've lost entirely. I had it too. I just forgot. My brain didn't turn it on. I'm doing this so

745
02:49:33,450 --> 02:49:41,860
incorrect. No, I wanted to go up, not diagonal. You piece of shit Xbox controller. Why are you

746
02:49:41,860 --> 02:49:49,540
the worst controller? And why are you the only one that works on fucking Steam? The PS4 controller

747
02:49:49,540 --> 02:50:24,700
doesn't like to work and you have to unplug it and get like this fucking software. Okay, I know

748
02:50:24,700 --> 02:50:28,969
what I gotta do. I know what I gotta do. I know what I gotta do. Wait, wait, wait. Don't grab onto

749
02:50:28,969 --> 02:50:42,420
this. Grab onto the edge here and you can't, you gotta go back down. Why is everybody putting the

750
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:50,889
cheese? Should I even ask that question? No, that's it. That's what it is. You gotta dash,

751
02:50:50,889 --> 02:51:04,540
win right on the edge. This, right on the edge. Got it. Bingo. Oh shit. Oh my God. I didn't even

752
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:23,829
see what was at the end of this level. Stupid Xbox controller. Hey, are you sure you don't want to

753
02:51:23,829 --> 02:51:31,750
go? Hey, when you press and press left on d-pad and sometimes just press, press all 180 degrees

754
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:43,420
left down up and every, the whole side, do the whole thing. Did you not want to do that? Did you

755
02:51:43,420 --> 02:52:12,500
want, you didn't want to do that. Sorry. That'll be $80 per controller please. I didn't do that.

756
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:33,209
I didn't do that. Why do you, didn't, I pressed left. Doesn't even, yes, no.

757
02:52:34,360 --> 02:52:54,940
Give me that strawberry. By the way, listen to these. You know how annoying it is to play a game

758
02:52:54,940 --> 02:53:27,319
that requires you to press R1 or L1 more than once every few seconds? Fucking Xbox. Cool Xbox. See,

759
02:53:27,479 --> 02:53:55,059
like 2030 when crackdown comes up. I'm being, I'm being mean to Xbox right now.

760
02:53:55,780 --> 02:54:11,350
Why are you being so mean to Xbox? Big bits. We got big bits. Big bits. Pugatron. Give $30.

761
02:54:14,340 --> 02:54:17,860
Thank you so much for the 30 bucks. Hey, love you, German. Thanks for being such a great

762
02:54:17,860 --> 02:54:21,700
entertainer. Thank you. Thanks for hanging out. We're just having fun. That's all we do.

763
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:35,590
This is your last chance, Oshiro, but thank you so much for the $30. You already ruined it,

764
02:54:35,590 --> 02:54:41,350
making a guest clean up your mess. I don't hate the Xbox. I don't hate the Xbox. I just hate the

765
02:54:41,350 --> 02:54:47,430
console. I hate the controller. I hate the games and I hate the internet connection and I hate the

766
02:54:47,430 --> 02:55:05,370
UI. Something I don't hate the Xbox. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. You're already

767
02:55:05,370 --> 02:55:11,799
making a guest clean up your mess. She'll never stay. She's still here. There's still a chance.

768
02:55:12,760 --> 02:55:21,379
Did I just get banned for making a fart joke? That's a banned word now.

769
02:55:22,870 --> 02:55:29,030
Presidential Suite is the key. It will surely impress her. Get it together, Oshiro. Wait,

770
02:55:31,399 --> 02:55:51,030
but he's doing this. There you are. Follow me quickly. We're almost there. I have a confession

771
02:55:51,030 --> 02:56:01,719
to make. I actually like the layout of the Xbox controller. I prefer the layout to the PS4.

772
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:20,309
It's true. That actually is true. This guy keeps smashing me. I literally got banned for saying

773
02:56:20,309 --> 02:56:34,549
fart peepee. Well, maybe you shouldn't be saying fart peepee. Well, you guys just let me enjoy my

774
02:56:34,549 --> 02:56:57,690
pizza. Shit. That's what you have to do though. And I fucking blew it. I blew it so bad. I gotta

775
02:56:57,690 --> 02:57:08,170
leave the last couple of pixels. I gotta get. I am going to get angry. No, I'm not. Why? This

776
02:57:08,170 --> 02:57:29,000
game's fun. I'm not actually getting angry at anything in this game. Come on. Come on.

777
02:57:29,959 --> 02:57:38,040
Stand still. Got it. Wait, sub only? Sometimes we have to go to sub only because people write fart.

778
02:57:38,040 --> 02:57:43,079
Farts are like I'm farting. It's the only thing that I get to see in chat and we're gonna. We're

779
02:57:43,079 --> 02:58:00,840
gonna sour. I don't. You gotta stop bringing it up. When people are asking why am I getting like

780
02:58:00,840 --> 02:58:26,299
timed out and they write the thing. I have to answer it. I have to tell them why. Berry up there.

781
02:58:26,299 --> 02:58:43,530
Two berries, really? Have and then climb. Very fast. No, no. Have it right the first time.

782
02:58:44,250 --> 02:58:58,010
To climb over and then dash and then jump around dash again and land over here. There's two berries

783
02:58:58,010 --> 02:59:31,430
right now. I can't just not get them. Just land. Just land and you'll get it. Co-op juke. Nice.

784
02:59:46,549 --> 03:00:01,899
Baby gate. What's the baby gate? Open the baby gate. I just itched the back of my head really fast.

785
03:00:01,899 --> 03:00:09,540
That's how you know that things are starting to heat up. Big time. I just ruined everything. I have

786
03:00:09,540 --> 03:00:16,600
to dash across. I can't use this dash. You slow stupid idiot. Like you fucking. Look at how slow

787
03:00:16,600 --> 03:00:53,579
that guy is in comparison to the other one. I think that's all I can do down here. I gotta go back up.

788
03:00:54,680 --> 03:01:07,930
Yes. This way and I came from this way. I gotta get a key. Let's go over here and get the key.

789
03:01:08,889 --> 03:01:21,000
Madder than Hotline Miami. That is that is so far from the truth. I'm having a visit rate.

790
03:01:21,879 --> 03:01:42,440
Well I have to dash through. It's my own fault. Key that there's a secret and there's something

791
03:01:42,440 --> 03:01:56,020
over here. Do I keep this key forever? God I hope so. I do. I gotta time that to jump when it comes up.

792
03:01:58,100 --> 03:02:07,290
Oh shit. I get it. I get it. Oh my god. I had it right there. That was done.

793
03:02:08,250 --> 03:02:42,010
I get it. I get it. I get it. And I just pressed A for no reason. For no reason. There wasn't any

794
03:02:42,010 --> 03:02:50,149
reason to press A. You just slide down. I itched my fucking nose. I have like birds up there. I

795
03:02:50,149 --> 03:03:04,760
don't know what's in there. Why is my nose so itchy right now? Why is my nose so itchy? Yeah.

796
03:03:05,719 --> 03:03:14,280
I okay does anybody else get like this? When you play a game that requires your

797
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:22,520
complete immediate 100% focus do you go into a spell of where a place on your body starts to itch

798
03:03:23,579 --> 03:03:34,340
and you can't it doesn't stop. I don't know why. What's it for? Why does that mean? Does that mean

799
03:03:34,340 --> 03:03:43,829
like somebody's talking about you? You know you sneeze and people say oh that means somebody just

800
03:03:43,829 --> 03:03:56,469
talked shit about you. Gotta b-side. 3000 people are talking about you. Well stop because my nose

801
03:03:56,469 --> 03:04:05,190
is itchy. Mr. Oshiro's diary. The final entry appears to be decades old. As of today the hotel

802
03:04:05,190 --> 03:04:10,389
is officially closed. Charlotte organized the staff for a farewell hike up the mountain. Most

803
03:04:10,389 --> 03:04:15,190
of us have never seen the summit. It seemed like a fitting goodbye but when the time came I couldn't

804
03:04:15,190 --> 03:04:26,459
bear to leave without looking around one last time. I told them to go on without me. I will

805
03:04:26,459 --> 03:04:30,780
catch up with them soon after I double check that everything is in order. I can't believe my time

806
03:04:30,780 --> 03:04:37,350
here is over. What am I gonna do now? Perhaps I'll stay one last night so that the hotel and I can

807
03:04:37,350 --> 03:05:00,680
have a proper goodbye. All right what what is going on in this chat today? What's going on here?

886
03:26:28,420 --> 03:26:42,120
of junk that sounds like a fun morning he's a lost soul dear that place is much more than just a hotel

887
03:26:42,120 --> 03:26:48,629
to him don't make him your project you know what i think i think this mountain drove both of you

888
03:26:48,629 --> 03:26:58,459
crazy you know you're not the first person to say that maybe you're right how would i

889
03:26:58,459 --> 03:27:04,299
know if i were crazy the way i see it the mountain can't bring out anything that isn't already in you

890
03:27:06,760 --> 03:27:11,239
but you gotta be a few crows short of a murder to live up here in the first place right

891
03:27:14,250 --> 03:27:20,170
what are you even talking about oh i'm just rambling like the old bad i am ready to give

up i know shortcut back to your car back off lady i'm heading for the summit sometimes it's

893
03:27:31,059 --> 03:27:36,020

894
03:27:36,020 --> 03:27:47,020
when i was young good luck and mind the wind you don't get many visitors up here do you

895
03:27:47,979 --> 03:27:52,780

896
03:27:52,780 --> 03:27:58,219
live in solitude too i really tried to get through to mr ashura i wanted to help him

897
03:27:59,579 --> 03:28:03,739
sure needs to move on from that hotel but it's not going to happen on your schedule

898
03:28:04,299 --> 03:28:09,899
and doesn't help that you've got something to prove i'm talking very strangely i don't know why

904
03:29:00,489 --> 03:29:05,370
staying in one place for this long but then i found this mountain i knew right away that it

905
03:29:05,370 --> 03:29:12,010
would be my home what's so special about it the mountain shows you who you really are

906
03:29:13,049 --> 03:29:24,569
whether you're ready for it or not it keeps me honest isn't that interesting that just

907

03:34:21,510 --> 03:34:26,149
great goddamn channel over there please link it one of the mods link that channel

927
03:34:28,819 --> 03:34:33,510
by the way i need to figure out what the hell i'm doing here do i have a time limit on when i can

928
03:34:33,510 --> 03:34:55,940
order it up to a certain order i don't think i'm getting this maybe it does have to be in a

929
03:34:55,940 --> 03:34:58,979
certain order or if they go fast enough or they can't but they don't touch me

930
03:35:01,659 --> 03:35:10,120
joel got timed out how what yeah i have to go fast they can't touch me he posted the link and

931
03:35:10,120 --> 03:35:28,229
got banned no he didn't oh god let's start at the top left here where's the sounds he did because

932
03:35:28,229 --> 03:35:33,750
he's not a sub i'm sorry i didn't mean to time i didn't mean for the automatic bot to time you up

933
03:35:34,469 --> 03:35:51,850
wait still here you were supposed to learn this in chapter two but you skipped it like a dumb ass

934
03:35:52,729 --> 03:35:57,180
what do you mean like what do you hold on what do you mean like a dumb ass

935
03:35:57,180 --> 03:36:17,819
because i went a different way what uh so i can't touch the ground exactly that does not count as

936
03:36:17,819 --> 03:36:39,370
the floor so i probably start up here then the thing is you got yeah the grip thing is really

937
03:36:39,370 --> 03:36:51,209
gonna fuck me over here because i can't have to touch the ground so i gotta wait till the wind

938
03:36:51,770 --> 03:36:56,649
that's how you do this i bet does this count as the ground this doesn't count as the ground it

939
03:36:56,649 --> 03:37:19,020
does it well i wasn't not collecting this wind is killing me here so how the hell am i gonna get

940
03:37:19,020 --> 03:37:51,110
this one dash through well i think that's what i have to do i was on the right track here maybe

941
03:37:51,110 --> 03:37:59,670
this is this one's uh i feel like i have to dash to get this one dashing with the wind or get it

942
03:37:59,670 --> 03:38:21,450
absolutely last let's try it again okay yeah i gotta get this one and then this one last i

943
03:38:21,450 --> 03:38:40,569
shouldn't be dashing at all except for to get this one fuck i'm gonna get it it's possible ah

944
03:38:41,370 --> 03:39:00,840
if i had a dash it was impossible all right let me take a look so

945
03:39:02,280 --> 03:39:27,270
maybe if i drop down i shouldn't be dashing ran in the dash again this is celeste if you're

946
03:39:27,270 --> 03:39:48,940
wondering if you're curious what the game is what if i get this one first that may have just done it

947
03:39:49,500 --> 03:40:02,149
because i can reset it every time over here all right that should be it right

948
03:40:03,030 --> 03:40:16,780
as long as i can get over here got it i thought i was gonna run out of grips all right that was

949
03:40:16,780 --> 03:40:21,510
fun interesting so you gotta get them all before touching the ground cool it just took me a little

950
03:40:21,510 --> 03:40:36,250
while step two oh god welcome to hell this is gonna take a long no it's not i'll get it first try

951
03:40:36,250 --> 03:40:59,659
guaranteed where i'll delete my twitch channel right now it's still the first track thank god

952
03:40:59,659 --> 03:41:10,700
i don't have to delete my twitch channel another b-side tape very cool can i go anywhere else

953
03:41:13,959 --> 03:41:23,799
looks like i can go up but can i really though jeal nine thanks for the 10 community subs jeal

954
03:41:23,799 --> 03:41:39,750
nine you guys have given so many community subs tonight jeal thank you nothing up here anyways

955
03:41:42,809 --> 03:42:03,219
jeal all right fight the wind i got my berry i got the tape i just have to guess where it is

956
03:42:04,680 --> 03:42:12,440
just guess correctly this time oh my god what are you thinking why can i not do this

957
03:42:13,979 --> 03:42:29,350
what the fuck am i doing almost soiled it there but i got it all right berry right there don't do it

958
03:42:29,350 --> 03:42:36,200
like that there's no reason to do it like that all right climb probably have to time this to when it's

959
03:42:36,200 --> 03:42:49,899
not snowing i mean windy you know what i mean if i go the other way no that was it i had it

960
03:42:50,299 --> 03:43:12,180
oh i think i have to hold on and not do the dash maybe not i gotta wait for the

961
03:43:12,180 --> 03:43:18,889
wind has to blow me back that way okay i get it so we how much let's count it ready one

962
03:43:19,610 --> 03:43:35,219
two three one two three one two three one one two three oh my god you gotta go when the wind is

963
03:43:35,219 --> 03:43:52,309
blowing right when it starts get it come on blow it's close never really i really had it there too

964
03:43:55,899 --> 03:44:07,879
i'll get it i know it's right i have it just fucking xbox controller

965
03:44:18,680 --> 03:44:40,020
do it i didn't even need the wind didn't even need it bite controller no no biting spikes

966
03:44:40,819 --> 03:45:02,790
very two berries okay i would assume that's probably correct it is correct if i could just

967
03:45:02,790 --> 03:45:25,860
do it there's one and that's not how you get that one how do you get that let me see hold on

968
03:45:26,420 --> 03:45:46,870
is there a way to go up from here well this is blocked off now let's try this way it's different

969
03:45:52,540 --> 03:45:53,340
oh shit

970
03:46:10,069 --> 03:46:22,739
um okay well you this can be controlled with my mind to break that

971
03:46:24,250 --> 03:46:31,860
maybe not i have to go all the way up and then all the way down

972
03:46:34,139 --> 03:47:05,299
apparently i guess maybe i do have to break it no i don't oh i have to control this too shit

973
03:47:07,510 --> 03:47:43,540
come with me i forgot to press the button this is it this right holy shit okay just let go man

974
03:47:43,540 --> 03:48:05,479
just let go i didn't even hold i didn't hold right trigger i'm so angry just do it man i really am

975
03:48:05,479 --> 03:48:30,440
just trying to jeremy i'm not gonna ask you to do this again it's really that wasn't that hard you

976
03:48:30,440 --> 03:48:42,489
just had to do it all right got all the berries that's it you're grounded jeremy you're grounded

977
03:48:48,379 --> 03:49:03,379
any other ways to go there is what we're looking at there's a way to go to the top right this is

978
03:49:03,379 --> 03:49:23,059
gonna be a pain in the ass i can already tell oh my god holy shit there's a spike so nothing

979
03:49:23,059 --> 03:49:32,250
not it's a that's a level is done good good for you got it what there is how do i get up there

980
03:49:32,250 --> 03:49:47,940
there's gonna be a way right jump on here and then fall maybe no because i don't think i can

981
03:49:47,940 --> 03:50:13,459
reach no i can't reach oh fuck how do i can i get that to move nice all right so this is the water

982
03:50:14,260 --> 03:50:30,020
why do i always play a game a year after release i mean do i do that i just i play games and i don't

983
03:50:30,020 --> 03:50:36,059
have to play a game at all here's this is a i guarantee it as a reference here what the

984
03:50:36,059 --> 03:50:59,430
fuck did i tell you i knew it so what do i do with this yep everybody talked shit when i made

985
03:50:59,430 --> 03:51:13,979
the flute noise and there's the reference right there and i got it first try your boomer brain

986
03:51:13,979 --> 03:51:24,739
helped uh this is gonna be interesting okay i gotta go and then jump on this before it crashes in

987
03:51:24,739 --> 03:51:46,569
maybe i have to do that first can is that even possible holy shit man got it so that's another

988
03:51:47,209 --> 03:52:07,819
cool i didn't go up though interesting ow i never played super mario 3 so it took me 20 minutes to

989
03:52:07,819 --> 03:52:15,500
figure that out if you have that's just a white block why would you ever know what to do if you

990
03:52:15,500 --> 03:52:32,059
never even heard of it oh this is on track i can't move it oh shit i just have to go the other way i

991
03:52:32,059 --> 03:52:52,809
had it whoops that's gonna screw the whole thing up isn't it jex it what is jex it

992
03:53:01,030 --> 03:53:51,540
don't act like i don't know shit no the wind really is tough why did i scream in your ears i'm

993
03:53:51,540 --> 03:54:01,190
sorry because i'm an awful streamer and i forget the how loud noises hurt all right this is an

994
03:54:01,190 --> 03:54:09,750
interesting scenario here i jump fall down dash up that i knew i figured the wind would have carried

995
03:54:09,750 --> 03:54:36,489
me there that's what you gotta do it's close i'll get it patience myself patience i'm giving it some

996
03:54:36,489 --> 03:54:49,940
pretty decent patience here all right so then it's just fall grab hi we love you no matter how loud

997
03:54:49,940 --> 03:55:05,610
you scream maybe i should just get the bubble no are you calmly mad or just mad i'm just calm

998
03:55:06,489 --> 03:55:28,299
i'm just enjoying the video game got it yikes okay that was got it nothing else just fall

999
03:55:28,860 --> 03:55:42,459
hold on oh no oh no go up to the top quick up this game is surprisingly calm and cozy

1000
03:55:43,180 --> 03:56:27,620
despite how tough it is yeah it is up maybe anything no ice cactus again i did it again

1001
03:56:28,100 --> 03:56:54,340
okay shit now i got it wind is going the other direction now yeah typically i would play a game

1002
03:56:54,340 --> 03:57:01,049
like this for only a few hours at a time because they can really just get inside your brain

1003
03:57:02,250 --> 03:57:18,469
gotta go up but i'm still this is still i like it oops from here uh ride the platform with a

1004
03:57:18,469 --> 03:57:37,350
bubble and then bubble up i just freaked out because oh shit what i thought i was gonna need

1005
03:57:37,350 --> 03:57:48,090
to jump it's gonna put me right here perfect that's what you gotta do you gotta just that's

1006
03:57:48,090 --> 03:58:05,770
what you gotta do oh what all right i'm gonna pantomime something and i want you to know i want

1007
03:58:05,770 --> 03:58:39,899
you to guess what it is okay no i'm not it was the xbox controller surprise i don't have that's not

1008
03:58:39,899 --> 03:58:52,459
what pantomime means yeah well i was gonna do it but i decided against it did i ruin it

1009
03:58:54,899 --> 03:59:24,940
no i'd rather i would rather die than have to do that an xbox uh looks like i'm going this way

1010
03:59:25,579 --> 03:59:52,840
because i have to let's think this through let me see what happens when i touch this

1011
03:59:52,840 --> 03:59:57,799
right okay right right okay we gotta catch it on the way back

1012
03:59:57,799 --> 04:00:06,420
okay

1013
04:00:11,209 --> 04:00:20,629
no right right right right right right what you gotta do and i'm just not getting i that's what

1014
04:00:20,629 --> 04:00:41,459
you gotta do you gotta do it quick bingo one you gotta that's not what you gotta do you have to

1015
04:00:41,459 --> 04:01:13,319
grab the edge i gotta grab the edge you fucking got it idiot come in oh it's not possible without

1016
04:01:13,319 --> 04:01:42,629
thing yes it is don't ever tell me that's not possible it's not possible oh go down this

1017
04:01:43,670 --> 04:02:09,780
okay go ahead i gotta go ahead right i would have had it bring it up good very good very good very

1018
04:02:09,780 --> 04:02:40,250
good so pretty this is a very pretty game isn't it i agree probably should hold on secret no wait

1019
04:02:40,250 --> 04:02:52,860
can i go up gotta check for secrets it's possible this one's up here i don't know

1020
04:02:53,899 --> 04:03:18,299
you gotta check down down right in video game controllers man i swear

1021
04:03:21,290 --> 04:03:48,170
there's a huge it's a it's a big conspiracy i think what the fuck are you what's happening

1022
04:03:48,170 --> 04:04:23,209
to the controller i swear to god oh man i did it and no fruit there's a hole right here though

1023
04:04:23,770 --> 04:04:54,059
just take a look this looks like hell sure let's do it have you tried turning on the controller

1024
04:04:54,780 --> 04:05:09,530
it's one thing i actually haven't tried is turning it on i'm using my teeth like all right very

1025
04:05:09,530 --> 04:05:46,500
clearly i have to jump off and you also have to pull it and i jumped over it running out of gas

1026
04:05:46,500 --> 04:06:17,399
here running out of gas i'm gonna be on the other side just covered in fucking water just sweating

1027
04:06:17,399 --> 04:06:30,059
my ass off my hands are sweating i'm like a dog you know a dog doesn't sweat the only sweats

1028
04:06:30,059 --> 04:06:35,719
take through his mouth i don't i didn't even know i didn't even know and i would have known if i

1029
04:06:35,719 --> 04:06:44,360
known i would have known i i i'm sweating through my hands right now it's the only part that's

1030
04:06:44,360 --> 04:07:05,770
sweating can i get it oh i'm so happy drink from your hands i'm not sure that's a good idea

1031
04:07:12,360 --> 04:07:29,670
very you probably have to just dash only because jumping is not gonna help i don't think

1032
04:07:34,120 --> 04:07:56,229
shit you gotta get to the very edge try hitting jump and that i didn't know you could do this

1033
04:07:57,110 --> 04:08:15,000
you just you can ask this actual dash jumping new mechanic and i didn't even learn it somebody told

1034
04:08:15,000 --> 04:08:33,530
me about it just do it oh just do it hold on sorry guys i have to get the the layer of oil off my

1035
04:08:33,530 --> 04:09:01,379
hands how's that for a gamer challenge my hands are covered in like oil hold on no no i turned

1036
04:09:01,379 --> 04:09:09,510
on the camera and it stopped that's gonna haunt me for three days now i'm not gonna be able to

1037
04:09:09,510 --> 04:09:43,290
sneeze for three days fuck why did i do that wind wind no it's not enough why is it not letting me

1038
04:09:43,290 --> 04:10:06,409
jump up is this because the wind i don't think i can do this from right now i can holy shit you

1039
04:10:06,409 --> 04:10:25,930
got it oh boy you gotta go fast my hands are falling off the controller god face the snowball

1040
04:10:26,649 --> 04:10:40,059
this sucks i hate this wind i hate the wind i don't like the wind i'm playing tug of war with the

1041
04:10:40,059 --> 04:11:07,049
video game right now oh fuck itchy face stop it just go what am i doing that's all right i got

1042
04:11:07,049 --> 04:11:34,579
the berry oh i didn't have a jump didn't have a jump i thought i had one still all right something

1043
04:11:34,579 --> 04:11:40,620
i gotta remember that uses a dash maybe that it's not just like a fancy jump it's actually dashing

1044
04:11:41,579 --> 04:12:09,000
i almost died i think it didn't this is the guy that beat dark souls on stream yep one of the only

1045
04:12:09,000 --> 04:12:57,719
ones i have to jump on them this is such extreme when oh no oh i had it was so close

1046
04:12:58,600 --> 04:13:34,100
this is the hardest level in the whole game they fall to oh i've overshot it that would have been

1047
04:13:34,100 --> 04:14:01,030
it too i had it thank god i don't have a face cam on right now you can see what i'm doing

1048
04:14:01,030 --> 04:14:33,940
this is the longest i've spent on leveling it's probably this is probably one of the easiest

1049
04:14:34,579 --> 04:14:47,540
slides in the whole game and i'm still here my fucking god

1050
04:14:54,569 --> 04:15:07,420
all right did it i just beat the easiest slide in the game don't do diagonal uh blame phil spencer

1051
04:15:08,059 --> 04:15:14,659
it's his fault because he owns these controllers and they're his all of them he sells them out of

1052
04:15:14,659 --> 04:15:33,079
his fucking truck in his house he makes them in his spare time oh did the truck no no no no

1053
04:15:33,239 --> 04:15:49,989
oh my god oh it's too much i feel like i'm getting the wind blowing on me in real life

1054
04:15:57,450 --> 04:16:43,479
do it i was doing now i'm going real fast i jumped over how did i jump over i can't believe i had

1055
04:16:52,569 --> 04:17:14,139
oh i just to go underneath it what the fuck not i think i'm just doing it wrong let me sit here

1056
04:17:14,139 --> 04:17:43,700
okay got it i win john wait up what i nailed it this is the most comical character

1057
04:17:44,420 --> 04:17:58,540
theo you all right yeah just give me a second a gondola i've always wanted to ride one of these

1058
04:17:59,579 --> 04:18:03,340
it looks pretty old but maybe it still works i don't see any other way to cross this

1059
04:18:04,219 --> 04:18:06,920
chasm let's do it

1060
04:18:11,270 --> 04:18:22,569
this lever looks important easy every time i was probably going to go to the operator in a past

1061
04:18:22,569 --> 04:18:32,139
life do you think this is safe i'm sure it's fine how to check out with oshiro

1062
04:18:34,700 --> 04:18:38,059
i shouldn't have tried to help him because i told you so but

1063
04:18:38,700 --> 04:18:44,379
i should have listened they didn't get hurt and that's what matters

1064
04:18:48,069 --> 04:18:58,899
local boomer can't beat children's platformer i can barely breathe that's bullshit that you know

1065
04:18:58,899 --> 04:19:08,149
that it's not even like that what okay if we don't get a selfie on this thing we're going to regret it

1066
04:19:09,829 --> 04:19:15,450
i can't even see the ground through the mist this is not a children's platformer i know and

1067
04:19:15,450 --> 04:19:23,180
you're gonna have to explain that to i don't even know who said it i just read it how high up are we

1068
04:19:24,540 --> 04:19:40,809
less panicking more posing looks like we stalled out this guy's always taking selfies

1069
04:19:42,950 --> 04:19:48,579

1072
04:20:14,819 --> 04:20:20,379
don't take it out on me stay with me my grandpa taught me a trick for this close your eyes

1073
04:20:23,059 --> 04:20:30,790

1074
04:20:32,409 --> 04:20:56,579
just breathe slow and steady in and out am i supposed to do this oh it's x a i have to match

1075
04:20:56,579 --> 04:21:12,090

1076
04:21:12,090 --> 04:21:43,290
in the box but there we go nice and easy did i win i mean i'm not really breathing very well here

1077
04:21:43,290 --> 04:22:12,200

1078
04:22:12,200 --> 04:22:17,770

1079
04:22:19,370 --> 04:22:29,340
oh i totally thought we were done for but there is no there's a raid up here

1080
04:22:30,579 --> 04:22:35,510
uh there's a rare charizard and i gotta get the gym up here i'm sorry what were you saying

1081
04:22:37,670 --> 04:23:02,469
lol lol whoa that's a crazy selfie technically so who took this picture is what i want to know

1082
04:23:05,340 --> 04:23:26,969
scary right we don't ever find out who that is shit almost looks like we're almost at the

1083
04:23:26,969 --> 04:23:43,209
summit right we got maybe a couple more worlds mirror temple chapter five not close

1084
04:23:49,290 --> 04:24:02,600
not even close to it said there are seven total chapters plus one bonus okay i wonder if i should

1085
04:24:02,600 --> 04:24:08,139
break this into two streams what do you think tomorrow two go for like another all right so

1086
04:24:08,139 --> 04:24:15,799
if i go for like another hour right so would that be like two like five to six two like six

1087
04:24:15,799 --> 04:24:20,920
hour streams two five hour streams back to back that makes sense right the end worlds are really

1088
04:24:20,920 --> 04:24:41,799
long okay so after this chapter call it and finish it tomorrow and do the tapes too bonus

1089
04:24:41,799 --> 04:24:48,940
worlds and b-sides okay we'll see where we're at in like another hour so we'll just take a look

1090
04:24:48,940 --> 04:24:56,700
oh man look at this place feeling adventurous i don't know you're not going to do the tapes in

1091
04:24:56,700 --> 04:25:03,739
one stream well i mean i don't plan i plan on trying to do some of them looks pretty dark in

1092
04:25:03,739 --> 04:25:09,739
there more like a nightmare than an adventure i'll just take a quick i thought he was gonna say

1093
04:25:09,739 --> 04:25:14,620
selfie oh he that is what he said he is gonna take some pictures this place must be ancient

1094
04:25:15,899 --> 04:25:26,500
the oh wait my insta pics followers are gonna eat this up you won't do the tapes in one stream

1095
04:25:29,299 --> 04:25:34,360
i mean i don't really have an intention to i would try to do a one or two of them or three

1096
04:25:34,360 --> 04:25:40,600
of them or all of them in like 45 minutes it takes about two minutes per level two minutes per level

1097
04:25:41,399 --> 04:25:45,719
five levels per side two four six eight ten twelve yeah i'll beat it in probably like 14 minutes

1098
04:25:50,250 --> 04:26:05,659
secrets no this place is interesting looking i like the foot sounds that kind of glass sound sounds

1099
04:26:05,659 --> 04:26:21,299
good uh i don't have a there okay so there's a mechanic i can just squish that that like

1106
04:27:40,739 --> 04:28:13,799

1107
04:28:13,799 --> 04:28:29,479
i touched it i have to light them all up because look see i definitely have to light these all up

1108
04:28:29,479 --> 04:28:46,840
there's no way i don't that one i think that's all of them no not on this side i got them right

1109
04:28:47,639 --> 04:29:02,040
is that just for show those just actually don't do anything you don't have to light them up okay

1110
04:29:05,500 --> 04:29:06,059
whoa

1111
04:29:13,319 --> 04:29:30,870

1113
04:29:43,780 --> 04:29:56,569

1114
04:30:01,510 --> 04:30:15,989
jeremy is what he named his xbox controller

1115
04:30:29,030 --> 04:30:31,270
it is trust me it is i know what it's watching

1116
04:30:33,670 --> 04:30:35,739
this one's so easy just watch

1117
04:30:37,819 --> 04:31:05,780
now for this one there's enough spring on it all right so what are you doing

1118
04:31:06,979 --> 04:31:07,860
shit i had it

1119
04:31:10,629 --> 04:31:40,120
oh i didn't even need to do that real talk strawberries are the best berries

1120
04:31:40,120 --> 04:31:45,190
you know i might actually i might agree with that but i don't think so

1121
04:31:50,379 --> 04:32:13,350
well that's how you think okay it's that easy apparently this is my first time watching this

1122
04:32:13,350 --> 04:32:35,959
stream i won't be coming back oh well i'm sorry sorry i told you guys to behave we didn't do

1123
04:32:35,959 --> 04:32:57,100

1124
04:33:02,379 --> 04:33:03,860
oh geez okay

1125
04:33:07,259 --> 04:33:07,759

both sides are open more berries i get it i get a jump though i know you can do it

1128
04:33:36,380 --> 04:33:43,380
i'm certain i know you can do this you know you can do it

1129
04:33:45,639 --> 04:34:28,810
i know i just figured it out i give them just slowing down

1130
04:34:31,290 --> 04:34:50,619
i'm just slowing down remember this is the gamer fatigue

1131
04:34:52,220 --> 04:34:56,380
gamer fatigue sets in and you start to kind of just make the fucking dumb mistake

1132
04:34:57,500 --> 04:35:09,209
why am i going anywhere that didn't go because i went left i went right can't go down

1133
04:35:09,770 --> 04:35:33,159
up go the other side down here i already did this one down i think i got everything here didn't i

1134
04:35:36,279 --> 04:35:42,680
dude gamer fatigue sets in and then you start to make dumb mistakes and you need to go eat like a

1135
04:35:42,680 --> 04:36:07,020
snack i'm just gonna leave so how do i leave that's a great question because this is the

1136
04:36:07,020 --> 04:36:24,599
point straight up isn't that just called regular fatigue no no no it's different

1137
04:36:30,310 --> 04:36:39,130
come on i can grab the edge

1138
04:36:45,619 --> 04:37:01,880
come on i didn't jump slowing down gamer fatigue sets in oh fuck sorry i got

1139
04:37:05,529 --> 04:37:17,560
that one nothing else over there right uh-huh i'm gonna have to get in a bubble to go through

1140
04:37:17,560 --> 04:37:23,110
that one i think bubble from the other side there's gonna be a bubble on the all the way

1141
04:37:23,110 --> 04:37:33,419
to the edge i'm gonna bubble my way over there oops i see uh can i get through that is it a

1142
04:37:33,419 --> 04:37:48,009
secret it's not oops you know you could just duck jerry bane that is a possibility all right so

1143
04:37:48,970 --> 04:37:57,349
i'm gonna take that out so that one goes straight out let me get the cherry here first though

1144
04:37:58,229 --> 04:38:03,590
back

1145
04:38:16,020 --> 04:38:23,930
i was trying to donkey kong it probably still can i i i know i can do it trust me

1146
04:38:32,020 --> 04:38:47,590
all the way through go go go go go up so introducing blades there's the key

1147
04:38:52,200 --> 04:38:56,119
and a secret but not really because i didn't get the thing that was necessary

1148
04:38:57,000 --> 04:39:08,229
i didn't hit another button somehow shit i got a great question for all you guys watching

1149
04:39:08,229 --> 04:39:25,400
where in the name of god is the door that this key goes to i forget can i get that

1150
04:39:38,520 --> 04:39:45,159
oh i see i see that okay i don't think i can i get reliably back in there that's gonna be

1151
04:39:45,159 --> 04:40:10,819
paying the ass to get back in there i see exactly where it is though see right there i see it

1152
04:40:11,540 --> 04:40:32,630
okay bingo that's the other door so now let's finish this and there's a way to go through here

1153
04:40:33,270 --> 04:40:40,939
oh shit i need a bubble don't i so i got to take bubble from here all the way through

1154

1166
04:43:12,869 --> 04:43:18,950
dark and weird there's wait something's coming i'm feeling a strong inclination to run away

1167
04:43:18,950 --> 04:43:34,500
be careful okay it's very dark in here here let's see if we can get in there yes we can

1212
04:57:43,830 --> 04:57:56,340
fuck no diagonal again oh i really i think i'm gonna use a different control tomorrow

1213
04:57:56,340 --> 04:58:02,979
i'm gonna just plug my ps4 in that's really starting to get very very very irritating

1214
04:58:19,400 --> 04:58:22,840
use the keyboard i can't do a platform with a keyboard i don't know how anyone humanly

1215
04:58:22,840 --> 04:58:33,220
possibly does that platform with keyboard is off it's no way how did i not do that come on

1216
04:58:33,220 --> 04:58:46,200
some of you guys like i said are fucking super humans why not because something about like

1217
04:58:46,200 --> 04:58:54,200
putting your my hand down on keys like this and having to use my index finger my ring finger

1218
04:58:54,200 --> 04:59:02,259
to move around or my um it just doesn't doesn't translate to me it's not like wasd

1219
04:59:13,979 --> 04:59:25,029
anything else i missed up here i don't think so now i'm of the opinion that a controller is

1220
04:59:25,029 --> 04:59:40,540
is better in at least a very specific few scenarios all right don't touch the ground

1221
04:59:41,740 --> 05:00:02,520
i have the i'll get this one first i think a lot of third-person games just feel better

1222
05:00:03,560 --> 05:00:22,740
platform must feel better with the controller for me another cassette currently unlocking

1223
05:00:22,740 --> 05:00:30,419
content for tomorrow let's see i i mean you're just gonna have to go at some point

1224
05:00:32,900 --> 05:00:35,619
right can i get the whole thing in one go i might be able to

1225
05:00:50,580 --> 05:00:54,580
oh my god i gotta get through that it's gotta be right when it switches

1226
05:00:55,299 --> 05:01:03,799
so it's gotta be one two uh here we go no i had it i don't know why i just freaked out

1227
05:01:04,439 --> 05:01:23,619
oh shit okay now what about this one looks like i could uh bounce off the sides here

1228
05:01:25,700 --> 05:01:37,689
okay roo and then hold on because i can't make that jump so i have to hold on to that

1229
05:01:37,689 --> 05:01:44,580
like this okay well you fucking xboxed me thanks a lot just got xboxed

1230

1231
05:01:53,130 --> 05:02:23,770
shitty secrets that i missed maybe not that i can see that takes us that's the cassette

1232
05:02:26,220 --> 05:02:41,080
and now it's here down and then uh i get everything that i wanted to get i think so

1233
05:02:45,270 --> 05:03:11,819
i think it's time to leave i'm gonna go open the door now that's the gamer fatigue i got the

1234
05:03:11,819 --> 05:03:22,040
cassette the door wait what is this here to go back i'm just curious is there any reason to

1235
05:03:22,040 --> 05:03:46,709
go up or left or down or i don't think so here we go no reason to use the dash until now

1236
05:03:57,400 --> 05:04:09,139
i don't want to start this whole thing over again i'm gonna say down why no reason to go now

1237
05:04:09,860 --> 05:04:35,029
oh my god a couple different directions here well that's i just stretched i felt so far

1238
05:04:40,360 --> 05:04:58,069
i've got to take the i'm not gonna do that yet i'm gonna go right i guess that's the only way to go

1239
05:04:58,709 --> 05:04:59,270
no it's not

1240
05:05:03,909 --> 05:05:16,060
me to kick yes it is this is the game with the flying strawberries it is this is the game with

1241
05:05:16,060 --> 05:05:22,150
the flying strawberries you got it you nailed it completely i think we're just gonna go up

1242
05:05:24,860 --> 05:05:28,380
hold on a minute here though wait a second there's gonna be something on the side i know it

1243
05:05:29,880 --> 05:05:33,720
that you you wouldn't shoot that fast through the whole thing unless there's something to do here

1244
05:05:34,759 --> 05:05:53,270
i mean too late now this is gonna be a giant mirror i'm gonna assume that what a huge mirror

1245
05:06:04,500 --> 05:06:09,880
final boss i think we have at least four or five hours to go

1246
05:06:22,599 --> 05:06:28,220
it's gonna chase me the whole level isn't it i'm gonna have to fucking flappy bird through this

1247
05:06:28,220 --> 05:06:39,959
whole thing and oh it is me what am i supposed to do okay i can break and smash my head into stuff

1248
05:06:39,959 --> 05:06:51,139
and break stuff strawberries does the monster really even give a shit about strawberries i

1249
05:06:51,139 --> 05:06:59,259
would assume probably not there's no harm in checking what do these do can't go through them

1250
05:07:06,310 --> 05:07:13,939
why did chat slow down so much um i think it's starting to get a little later and people may

1251
05:07:13,939 --> 05:07:21,220
have left yeah there's probably people took off people had fun for a little while and then kind

1252
05:07:21,220 --> 05:07:34,869
of dwindled down a little just chilling out nothing else i feel like i'm gonna miss secrets

1253
05:07:34,869 --> 05:07:58,459
and i don't like making well did i just lose no now i am the monster i thought i could maybe

1254
05:07:58,459 --> 05:08:18,040

1282
05:14:32,439 --> 05:14:42,069
get the feather i don't have to do it well i'm dead

1283
05:14:49,930 --> 05:14:55,819

1284
05:15:09,450 --> 05:15:13,450

1286
05:15:36,470 --> 05:15:56,939

1287
05:16:06,259 --> 05:16:36,139
what did that even do for me what's going on what did that do for me what happened released him

1288
05:16:37,099 --> 05:16:46,020
fuck back to dragging through the whole thing

1289
05:16:47,220 --> 05:17:19,419

1290
05:17:19,419 --> 05:17:54,869
too there's one key okay strawberry up there there's a lot of things to see a lot of ways to go

1291
05:17:55,669 --> 05:18:03,209
um i um it's gonna unlock this one oh shit okay let's get him to break that door

1292
05:18:04,090 --> 05:18:20,040
it's progression it might be i think this is progression probably shouldn't do this

1293
05:18:21,000 --> 05:19:32,650
keep going i got no more oh no this is the worst speed run i've ever seen

1294
05:19:33,450 --> 05:19:48,220
i wonder if i can let me think about this for a second maybe i don't have to do that

1295
05:19:50,630 --> 05:20:07,900
is it possible that i okay i don't second key i didn't get that though unfortunately

1308
05:23:53,380 --> 05:23:55,619
do you get the feeling that this place knows you better than you know yourself

1309
05:23:57,000 --> 05:24:02,220
yeah i'm so embarrassed that you have to see the side of me i tried to stop you i hope that

1310
05:24:02,220 --> 05:24:08,220
selfie was worth it needed the you just did it here you heard it

1311
05:24:11,180 --> 05:24:28,500
it's the minute it's the middle one selfies are always not worth it i shouldn't be mad this isn't

1312
05:24:28,500 --> 05:24:33,419
your fault i'm glad you're safe but you're trapped because of me and now this temple is showing you

1313
05:24:33,419 --> 05:24:43,450
what i'm really like i'm horrible hey we're in this together don't act like this is all on you

1314
05:24:46,330 --> 05:24:51,610
what do you mean you didn't trap me in the crystal sure those monsters are coming from you but the

1315
05:24:51,610 --> 05:24:57,369
temple is shaping itself around me too i can feel it these eyes are staring at me and the

1316
05:24:57,369 --> 05:25:02,330
crystal is coming from me i know it i hate to ask but i really need your help right now

1317
05:25:04,950 --> 05:25:10,310
okay i've got your back i'll bust you out of that thing and then we'll escape together

1318
05:25:10,869 --> 05:25:16,950
just as soon as i find my way around to you my only hope right now i believe in you for real

1319
05:25:17,590 --> 05:25:26,389
i hope that's not a mistake you shouldn't have believed in me oh

1320
05:25:32,060 --> 05:25:55,909
you can skip cutscenes all right bye i'll get you out of there eventually soon baby

1321
05:25:56,630 --> 05:26:03,900
it's possible i gotta go up from there more shit that we haven't seen yet

1322
05:26:04,540 --> 05:26:22,279
um got another key there's three keys does that come back it doesn't is it oh shit

1323
05:26:24,860 --> 05:26:39,590
i'm kind of amazed out here um where was this door where's my map i need my map in the top right

1324
05:26:39,590 --> 05:26:55,479
corner this is where i was locked this what the hell was that for what was that for why did i

1325
05:26:55,479 --> 05:27:22,009
unlock that oh shit am i losing connection it'll be all right don't pass oh i can use

1326
05:27:22,009 --> 05:27:48,680
the bubble here okay no stay alive what time what time is it yeah sometimes you get a bump

1327
05:27:49,319 --> 05:27:57,290
we should be fine okay i need another key for that door did i miss anything up here

1328
05:28:03,959 --> 05:28:13,130
jeez well yeah that'll probably happen a couple more times

1329
05:28:14,650 --> 05:28:18,889
shit i just gotta move out of the way don't even touch it

1330
05:28:22,200 --> 05:28:36,360
ah that guy's freaking me out losing internet again

1331
05:28:42,299 --> 05:28:49,819
well now that's what i'm paying attention to so in fact let me just pause it for a second to make

1332
05:28:49,819 --> 05:29:16,860
sure there's nothing actually going on no it's just being annoying no ah he's right there

1333
05:29:17,990 --> 05:29:19,830
oh my god he's gonna fuck this whole thing up

1334
05:29:23,110 --> 05:29:35,770
still has comcast i i do not have comcast i have a different company but i got some

1335
05:29:37,029 --> 05:29:48,389
news for everybody here they're all bad all the question is let me see hold on

1336
05:30:00,060 --> 05:30:18,919
although i don't really have any reason to be over here this is locked hit it oh it'll be like

1337
05:30:18,919 --> 05:30:35,830
something hidden there's a berry in here or something i'm killing me there's a thing to jump

1338
05:30:35,830 --> 05:31:00,060
on right the other one it's gonna be the button god damn it i gotta go around no did i get it is

1339
05:31:00,060 --> 05:31:36,220
it open is it just open tell me it's open i'm just getting stuck don't you dare i'm at it smash it

1340
05:31:36,220 --> 05:31:45,060
with a hammer theo i finally found you i knew you'd make it it wasn't easy all those monsters

1341
05:31:45,060 --> 05:31:51,479
really coming from inside me that's a valid question i'll be happy to discuss how the

1342
05:31:51,479 --> 05:31:55,080
monsters relate to your inner self but right now my inner self is real sick of being stuck in the

1343
05:31:55,080 --> 05:32:11,080
crystal oh right this crystal is like an expression of my negative psychic energy or whatever

1344
05:32:12,520 --> 05:32:19,139
yeah but how do we break it if i knew why i trapped myself in this thing maybe i could bust out

1345
05:32:19,139 --> 05:32:23,139
but i don't and i don't think i can get at the bottom of it while we're stuck in this nightmare

1346
05:32:23,139 --> 05:32:32,490
dimension you might have to carry me oh what no i would have been like carry me i don't wait that

1347
05:32:32,490 --> 05:32:43,290

1374
05:42:26,819 --> 05:42:39,139
should stop it's about six hours and then just pick it up tomorrow i'm gonna actually start

1375
05:42:39,139 --> 05:42:50,819
on time tomorrow and then we'll just play it tomorrow starting at the normal time until

1376
05:42:51,700 --> 05:43:02,650
i finish it because one two three four five six said there was like another two worlds three worlds

1377
05:43:02,650 --> 05:43:09,349
another few hours and then the bonus content why did he stream hit and run for 12 hours

1378
05:43:09,909 --> 05:43:17,930
and not this um it's called i was never going to open hit and run ever again and i knew it

1379
05:43:18,729 --> 05:43:26,229
see with this i know that i'll open this again i'm certain i'll play it i'll play through it i can

1380
05:43:26,229 --> 05:43:30,630
come back to it another day i there was not a chance in hell i was going to open hit and run

1381
05:43:30,630 --> 05:43:38,680
ever again so i had to beat it so we'll start regular time tomorrow somewhere around three p.m

1382
05:43:38,680 --> 05:43:47,400
pacific not like 4 30 this time i feel fine i felt like kind of shitty the last

1383
05:43:48,970 --> 05:43:56,180
day before yesterday and yesterday but we'll be all right i'll be ready to go uh first impressions

1384
05:43:56,180 --> 05:44:03,450
after six hours i think it's great i think it's got just enough of a challenge factor

1385
05:44:03,450 --> 05:44:11,299
and a replayability factor where it's not super rage inducing but it's challenging and fun i

1386
05:44:11,299 --> 05:44:27,220
think it's great but i'll see you guys tomorrow around 3 p.m pacific and let's get to the bits

05:44:30,299 --> 05:44:36,700

1509
06:02:33,610 --> 06:02:37,930
there and maybe you're saying something or doing something that you might need to think about

1510
06:02:38,490 --> 06:02:50,459
potentially changing so maybe just take a look and see maybe the things you're saying take a step

1511
06:02:50,459 --> 06:02:58,819
back and breathe a little bit and see second of all um hope you have a great day too you want

06:03:57,590 --> 06:04:00,630
of times just maybe step back and try to figure out maybe what the things you're saying

for a second here as long as you're taking care of stuff that needs to be taken care of in your

1649
06:25:32,330 --> 06:25:36,950
life so if you have rent if you have bills and you're taking care of them and you're paying them

1650
06:25:36,950 --> 06:25:42,409
right once you have that extra income that you know that you can spend

1651
06:25:44,229 --> 06:25:50,659
then go for it there's no i don't think there's a reason to stop well and savings as well make

1652
06:25:50,659 --> 06:25:55,299
sure you're saving some money too whether you have other accounts or if you have an investment

1653
06:25:55,299 --> 06:26:01,619
portfolio if you have one of those but once all your necessities are taken care of and you have

1654
06:26:01,619 --> 06:26:17,830
something else left over then why not but just make sure you cover all your bases first don't

1655
06:26:17,830 --> 06:26:32,099
forget about savings it's very important buy gold hey if you have disposable income and you have

1656
06:26:32,099 --> 06:26:35,619
some in money you maybe want to try some investment opportunities you want to try something else

1657
06:26:36,180 --> 06:26:41,639

1672
06:28:14,250 --> 06:28:23,860

1673
06:28:24,659 --> 06:28:33,770
it is 10 47 p.m pacific time but that's why i know i'm on pacific so when we go you know we're about

1674
06:28:33,770 --> 06:28:39,049
five six hours into a stream and we're at that place where i know it's early for me but it's

1675
06:28:39,049 --> 06:28:49,290
not for everybody else maybe dial it back a little and do it again tomorrow that's totally fine

1678
06:29:05,720 --> 06:29:12,360
shitty stream with no webcam really keeps me relaxed i don't do webcam i don't do look i don't

1679
06:29:12,360 --> 06:29:18,630
do webcam there's a guy in the corner of your screen sitting there i don't want to do that

1680
06:29:26,069 --> 06:29:36,380
he does webcam i don't he almost got me there he does webcam all the time i do webcam all the time

1681
06:29:36,380 --> 06:29:45,340
but i don't leave it on webcam facecam to me all the time just feels like there's a security camera

1682
06:29:45,340 --> 06:29:51,299
that's pointing at me you know that feeling you get when you know you're on camera you're standing

1683
06:29:51,299 --> 06:29:55,139
somewhere you're out somewhere you're in a place where you know you are on fucking the security

1684
06:29:55,139 --> 06:30:00,979
camera and you just are like oh okay i'm just on that camera right now i guess it's like staring

1685
06:30:00,979 --> 06:30:15,180
at me i don't want to be i don't want to be done twitch chat security cam but we can tell you when

1686
06:30:15,180 --> 06:30:22,840
someone's behind you i i know that too i have mirrors you guys don't see them i got i got my

1687
06:30:22,840 --> 06:30:26,919
monitors here and above them is three huge mirrors to make sure i can always see behind me

1688
06:30:29,830 --> 06:30:36,459
haven't you done webcam for outlast i do i do webcam all the time but for me webcam and facecam

1689
06:30:36,459 --> 06:30:42,099
has to make sense as to why it's on in the first place if it's a scary game or i'm talking or

1690
06:30:42,099 --> 06:30:47,419
chatting or hanging out then yeah but i don't like the twitch chat security cam

1691
06:30:50,810 --> 06:31:07,099
you haven't noticed me behind you though how do you know that i haven't but i'm not i don't i'm

1692
06:31:07,099 --> 06:31:15,900
not against using a webcam i just don't i don't i don't why do you want to look at my my ugly mug

1693
06:31:17,380 --> 06:31:20,020
i think it just tracks from a lot of stuff that happens on the screen now

1694
06:31:20,819 --> 06:31:23,700
sometimes it doesn't maybe sometimes it is fun to have it on and i've done it before

06:31:24,659 --> 06:31:34,340
it's just my personal preference hey thank you jen thorough for the two dollars after you beat

1719
06:35:33,540 --> 06:35:43,459
more updates no more anything more like xp wasn't windows 7 the support for windows 7 stops in 2020

1720
06:35:45,740 --> 06:35:49,740
that's going to be a huge deal you want to talk about like the day of reckoning

1721
06:35:50,380 --> 06:35:55,740
when windows 7 is no longer officially supported by microsoft in 2020 what the hell is going to

1722
06:35:55,740 --> 06:36:04,020
happen there wait really oh yeah windows 7 is no longer going to be officially supported by patches

1723
06:36:04,020 --> 06:36:24,090
next year it's true oh yeah that is hopefully windows 10 will be better by then buy a whole

1724
06:36:24,090 --> 06:36:29,380
bunch of games and do a shitty we stream i think i already did that didn't i didn't i i had you know

1725
06:36:29,380 --> 06:36:40,779
i did a lot of wee stuff a year or two ago but do i have any advice again for bullies um

1726
06:36:45,029 --> 06:36:51,580
i mean the thing the thing about getting picked on and bullies and shit honestly you kind of have to

1727
06:36:51,580 --> 06:37:02,650
like there there's a thing no don't bully him back no no no no i'm not sure what your friend

1728
06:37:02,650 --> 06:37:09,979
situation is but if you can make a few friends and you can kind of be around them and hang out

1729
06:37:09,979 --> 06:37:16,409
with them and it kind of makes it a lot harder for someone to kind of come up to you and be like

1730
06:37:16,409 --> 06:37:19,450
oh hey fuck you it's like well i got two buddies here like you fuck you actually

1731
06:37:21,349 --> 06:37:27,979
there's like strength in numbers and what a lot of times a bully will kind of pick out and so

1732
06:37:27,979 --> 06:37:45,450
single out somebody and it's really really unfortunate shit you have to learn to laugh

1733
06:37:45,450 --> 06:37:58,139
it off and invalidate them yeah but it's it's really hard to do that really it sits on hopefully

1734
06:37:58,459 --> 06:38:02,860
in the school system wherever you are you know people are looking out for that watching out

1735
06:38:02,860 --> 06:38:08,459
for that i feel like in the current year that we're in now the current generation

1736
06:38:08,459 --> 06:38:11,580
i feel like people are starting to really pay attention to it now or try to

1737
06:38:25,450 --> 06:38:32,299
just ignore them advice doesn't work no i don't know why people are just so fucking mean sometimes

1738
06:38:32,299 --> 06:38:44,580
it really i don't get it i wish i had a perfect answer i really do you know what even tries

1739
06:38:44,580 --> 06:39:02,380
everyone just tries to look like they care yeah in my experience confronting a bully always kind

1740
06:39:02,380 --> 06:39:05,900
of scares them off one way or another not saying physically but bullies bully people because they

1741
06:39:05,900 --> 06:39:15,049
think they are weak yeah there's a whole lot of complex things going on when it comes to

1742
06:39:15,770 --> 06:39:22,090
bullies trying to make their friends laugh trying to you know impress somebody trying to look

1743
06:39:22,090 --> 06:39:34,259
strong tough there's so much going on there it's just laughing it off can help if it's just

1744
06:39:34,259 --> 06:39:40,919
trash talking yeah but if it gets to a point where there's actual real you know physical

1745
06:39:40,919 --> 06:39:45,799
consequences then somebody somebody has to be told about it you know somebody you can't live

1746
06:39:45,799 --> 06:40:04,459
your life just getting fucking picked on and shit that's just not fun it's not cool wish

1747
06:40:04,459 --> 06:40:11,299
people just wouldn't be assholes but i guess that's too much to ask yeah there's a whole

1748
06:40:12,259 --> 06:40:16,700
like i just said there's a whole lot of complex shit going on as to how it even starts

1749
06:40:17,340 --> 06:40:23,990
so i wish i had the perfect answer but i don't i'm not necessarily qualified to have like a

1750
06:40:23,990 --> 06:40:36,259
perfect answer but i wish you luck hopefully you can find a way to make you know alleviate it or

1751
06:40:37,619 --> 06:40:57,669
you know get the school involved at that point let somebody know that that shit's going on but

1752
06:40:57,669 --> 06:41:05,020
thank you best of luck to you thank you door cube for the one dollar by the way if you ever get to

1753
06:41:05,020 --> 06:41:09,979
be get to a part of the game you just can't be especially in the b sides there's invincibility

1754
06:41:09,979 --> 06:41:16,060
and infinite dash cheats in the options menu they help less than expert players see all the game

1755
06:41:16,060 --> 06:41:23,740
has to offer they help less than expert players well i haven't done them yet i did the first b

1756
06:41:23,740 --> 06:41:38,259
sides without a problem we'll see hold on to that thought there because i haven't done it yet

but thank you ever scar for the three dollars here since you have a we and the other systems
