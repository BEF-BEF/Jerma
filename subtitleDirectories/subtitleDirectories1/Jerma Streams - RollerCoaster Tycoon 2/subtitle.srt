1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:12,279
I am back. Let's change the game and the title of the stream to roller coaster. How about um

2
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,129
coast? I'm just kind of chill and play roller coaster. What's what's a good title?

3
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:40,939
Roller boffin? How about just rct2? Just roller coaster tycoon 2. Twitch integration? Unfortunately

4
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:47,979
twitch integration no longer exists. The server that was hosting it is no longer online. So the

5
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:52,859
only way you can do twitch integration unfortunately is I would have to open and run my own server on

6
00:00:52,859 --> 00:01:00,759
my own computer with the uh it's no longer operational anymore. I have to make my own server

7
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,640
and that was going to take longer. I mean I was I wanted to start streaming so

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:15,829
so let me move over here yeah and there was other reasons why I didn't really want to do that

9
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:20,150
immediately. Like I'll just turn it on and run like a java server on my own computer.

10
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,829
I feel like there's some security holes there that I would need to make sure weren't there.

11
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:42,359
All right uh hold on I'm just gonna write roller coaster tycoon 2 on sale now. No

12
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:55,269
whatever it doesn't matter. Roller coaster tycoon 2 with germa.

13
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,770
That would be so bad. I can fix it later. We'll come up with a better

14
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,430
we'll we'll come up with a better one. All right let me get it open.

15
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:21,939
I mean we're talking like a true nostalgia factor right here. Don't ask me why it was

16
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:27,699
today was the day we were going to play this. But it is. Can you hear it? I bet you so badly

17
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:33,539
you guys want me to change the screen right now and listen to that. You remember that?

18
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:54,389
All right start a new park. Roller coaster tycoon 2. Nope never mind.

19
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:08,740
There it is. All right so what do I want to start with? My own park or should I gotta like

20
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:25,930
kind of remember how to play? How about crazy castle? Yeah this is open rct. Build your own

21
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:33,270
six flags adventure. Build your own six flags. Okay I okay you gotta I remember this stuff.

22
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,889
Build your own design a six flags park to build rides and other six flags parks are designed

23
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:44,169
and build your own. You have to have 1500 quests in your park at the end of October year four with

24
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:49,210
a park rating of at least 600. All right so there are some things that I remember that I played

25
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,909
this game a lot when I was younger. I played roller coaster tycoon 3. I think even on this stream or

26
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:03,659
on a video before. Admission price. What I typically do is I make the we I do it just like they do at

27
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,740
every six flags you've ever been to. The park admission is like 30 or 40 bucks. Like 20 bucks.

28
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:19,980
All the rides are free and then you just you just drain them at the concession stand. I'm not going

29
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,899
to charge for toilets. That would make me a monster. But we need stuff here first. Let's pause it.

30
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:32,680
How much money do I have? Okay remember I can remember the controls. You can you can spin it

31
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,889
around too can't you? So let's hold right click. Zoom in. Zoom out. I like the zoom in. It's fine.

32
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:48,730
Okay so we need this is I gotta name the park. What is it called? Where's my where's my name

33
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:58,860
the park thing here? I think I have to open it first. So I got a big open land. Let's do

34
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:08,730
let's just get everything laid out. Let's do like just dirt. Let's go dirt. Well it's already kind

35
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:22,300
of this the stone right? I mean I can't do it when the game is paused. Why not? Let's go up here. I'm

36
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,379
thinking a little little line this way. How much money do I have? Where's my total money? 9,700.

37
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:39,480
You got to start very slow. So I'm thinking hamburger stand hamburger stand ferris wheel

38
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:46,759
and then that's it and open it. Where are my rides? Where's my ride development? I know I have that

39
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:56,490
somewhere. His rides. I'm thinking the choo choo train. Slow. No no no no no no. Just hear me out.

40
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:05,660
I'm thinking the monorail around the entire park. Is it R to switch? No no no no stop.

41
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,290
You know what I mean? Have the monorail go all the way around the whole thing.

42
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:17,779
You'll get on this ride. It'll take like three hours. You can see everything. So let's go ahead

43
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:27,300
and get this made. I want to flip it this way. So to know actually it should be like this because

44
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:44,860
then I can have it be going all the way around. Let's go like this. Forward. Okay all right that

45
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:55,990
looks all right. Now let's go ahead and start building the track. Oh shit. I have to do the

46
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:02,759
doesn't this cost a lot of money? This is insanely expensive from what I remember.

47
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:17,029
How much is it gonna cost? 90 bucks? Oh for the love of god that's way too much money.

48
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:38,259
I'm just gonna cut it this way. I'm gonna use this as the edge here. All right can I cut it now?

49
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:51,139
Let's see. Let's go forward one right here. Okay let's see. Can I cut it? I think so.

50
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:09,060
Yep all right we're good. All right how much is this? 157 dollars per? No keep going up a

51
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:25,110
little more. No back it up. What's the point of a monorail? I don't think there is one.

52
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:36,389
No go back. Back up. I have to back this up. I turned it a little. No I didn't. That's all right.

53
00:08:36,950 --> 00:09:11,659
All right it doesn't need to be exact. Just like it has to be close enough. This is a big park.

54
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:26,889
I don't think this is. I'm gonna run out of money before I do this. Okay uh let's go. Let's close it.

55
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:32,980
This is not a roller coaster. This is a road. This is just a you can ride around and view the park.

56
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,700
How many miles is this? Take out the loans? No no no all right. Well this will we'll keep this here.

57
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:47,850
I'm gonna build out this way first. This is a huge park. Big big big big park. It's okay.

58
00:09:48,570 --> 00:10:08,259
This will work out. This is actually this is not bad because this will be my area to build.

59
00:10:08,259 --> 00:11:11,100
I just need to go up. Oh yeah the monorail is sitting on the ground.

60
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,200
Yeah that's right. It is just on the ground. How are you gonna see everything?

61
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,799
This is the slow moving car on a track. It's all right. People will like it. The kids. This is for

62
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:58,340
the kids. The kids will love this shit. I was good. I was always so bad at trying to do this shit

63
00:12:01,080 --> 00:13:09,190
because you got to match it up. Oh I can do better anyways.

64
00:13:47,669 --> 00:14:02,889
All right so I'm gonna go like this. That's a good start. No monorail. I'm not doing the monorail.

65
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:09,049
It's like we're gonna start easy. We're gonna start with like the haunted the ferris wheel.

66
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:17,419
You start with the ferris wheel every time. Oh the maze. This one's fun. No no no. I need like an

67
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:25,990
information center first. Okay we've got funnel cakes, hot dog stall. Where's like the info center

68
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:33,860
and balloons? Yeah bathroom. Not yet. Let's put ATMs. These are important here. ATM here.

69
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:51,000
Go ahead and open it. Okay let's get another ATM. Let's go ahead and open it. Is it already open?

70
00:14:51,960 --> 00:15:03,639
They both opened. Good. All right. It's off center. It's fine. I can. It doesn't matter. It's

71
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,840
un- why? Why is there no music? Yeah this is supposed to be music in this game.

72
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:24,019
What's going on? Guess can't get to the entrance of cash machine one. Yeah the park's not open.

73
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:40,460
I don't understand. What are they? What are they? How do you move shit around?

74
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:55,019
Can I not pick it up? Spin it this way. It's because the thing the lip wasn't there. All right.

75
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,250
All right so let's open them up. To uh now we're gonna have a small ride here.

76
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:12,539
I want and um should I do food? Yeah let's do burgers. Burger food right at the entrance.

77
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:19,779
No I'm not gonna rebuild the monorail. I turned that turned into a disaster.

78
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,179
Food right at the entrance. I bought anytime that I go to a place like a Six Flags. I always want

79
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:34,500
food right at the front door. We're going here. Right at the front door. Burger price. Make it

80
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,009
same throughout the park. Profit per item. It's gonna be a dollar sixty. Remember this is like

81
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:44,330
1994 prices. So you're probably like what the fuck dude? What are you talking about man? It's

82
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:51,779
like should be six. No dollar sixty. This is like back in like the fucking 30s. Let's get uh now

83
00:16:51,779 --> 00:17:00,259
we let's get two burgers. No we got a variety. Put on the Animal Crossing OST. You got it.

84
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:17,900
How do I like pause this? Animal Crossing soundtrack collection. Complete edition.

85
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:26,950
All right get comfortable because this is going to be a real snooze. That's not a way you should

86
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:39,930
describe your live stream. There we are. Just sit in the background. Get under the covers you know.

87
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:54,119
Wait isn't it like four o'clock in the afternoon? All right go to bed if you're like 78. Okay here

88
00:17:54,119 --> 00:18:04,630
we go. So we got the burger stand. Let's go with a french fries right next to it. What do you say?

89
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:14,009
The game's paused. How much are the french fries? Same price throughout the park. Let's make them

90
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:25,779
uh let's make them a dollar forty. Make them a little cheaper. So we got burgers fries. What

91
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:28,900
the hell else are we gonna do here? How about a pretzels stall? Yeah that's a good snack.

92
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:35,940
Pretzels would be a little cheaper. A lot of people. We got a lot of foot traffic here.

93
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:47,460
Make them 90 cents. Okay let's uh I think we need drinks too. How could we forget lemonade?

94
00:18:47,460 --> 00:19:04,789
Uh lemonade price. Dollar 20. Make it the same throughout the park. Dollar 40. What I should do

95
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:10,470
is I should make I should have no drinks and to scream on a big intercom. Hold a cup outside.

96
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:28,069
It's free. We'll do a soda as well. Is this spongebob music or is this?

97
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,339
No no that's too clustered too clustered. I don't want to do that. We need a ride.

98
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:40,009
We're doing a nice relaxing easy ride. We're doing an intro ferris wheel right here.

99
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:48,650
The line doesn't have to be very long although these ones always have a ton of people that

100
00:19:48,650 --> 00:20:00,440
care about them for some dumb reason. This is the entrance right and here's the exit. All right

101
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:10,619
so uh ferris wheel. Okay no forward rotation. Number of rotations. One. Reliability. Inspection

102
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:20,599
time. Every 30 minutes is fine. I want it to be uh we got to be a central theme here. Ice. No.

103
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:30,180
Space. No. Plane. What's wrong with one rotation? It goes around once. It takes like 25 minutes.

104
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:41,779
The theme should be pretzel. I don't think I can do a pretzel theme. Gravy? No that's castle. How

105
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:48,099
am I going to do pretzel themed? I mean the log cabin should all right let's we're doing this is

106
00:20:48,099 --> 00:21:00,700
a pretzel park. Log cabin. That's all right that's fine. It's really it's very ugly but it's okay.

107
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:14,359
Okay admission price it's free or should it be like five cents? No. Okay that's fine. It is now

108
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:21,500
ready to test. I need to get a queue in there. Just go with the standard queue. That's fine.

109
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,579
And then I don't I'm one of those people that doesn't like to have the queue be I like having

110
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:38,759
a clean exit not the queue exit. Am I charging? Only am. Charge for admission. All right so far

111
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:48,630
so good. Two bathrooms. No those are ATMs. That'll be tested to be ready to go. I need staff too

112
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:57,400
right? Yeah. I need a handyman. No I don't. Not yet. One mechanic. One. Okay I need the entertainer.

113
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,859
Those are important to have like just sitting right here. Where do you go? All right you go here.

114
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:11,619
Is it knight? Roman costume. No no no no no no. Astronaut. 55 dollars a month. That's

115
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:21,849
all right that's really really really low. I want you to be in this area here. Do not go anywhere

116
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:33,190
else. Just stay at the front door. Thank you. That's his path. I'm walking around. All right

117
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:41,140
I need to now should I open the park with one ride? I have to start making money. We have an

118
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:50,500
astronaut, a ferris wheel, and food. Okay should I make the park like a dollar? This is not even

119
00:22:50,500 --> 00:23:02,759
worth going to. Five dollars. No it's no no no not yet. No no no no it's not. I gotta make two more

120
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:11,289
rides. I'm not gonna get. No no no no not gonna happen. Here we go. This one. Oh I love this one.

121
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:21,750
Custom design. No no no no no no no. This is a lot of money. Uh no I can do. I'm gonna do custom

122
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:36,650
design here. We're going over here. One two three. That's fine. Let's get it started. I'm gonna go up

123
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:44,009
with a chain. Can it can it even do it? Special. Station platform spinning tunnel. Oh yeah that's

124
00:23:44,009 --> 00:24:04,630
look at this. This is like some cartoon shit here. Okay station platform. No I don't need that. I

125
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:21,529
don't want to be that long. I'm gonna go spin up and then come back around. Why is this a puke ride?

126
00:24:21,529 --> 00:25:11,640
No it's not. I'm making it very easy. Uh is that as high as it can go? Not just a circle. Pog

127
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,990
champ. What's going on? New ride attraction. Steel twister. You got it. What is this design?

128
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:29,779
This is interesting. What a way to describe it. It's very interesting isn't it? Let's get this

129
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:54,119
back to ground level. You fucking nailed it. Let's test it out. Test. How many cars? No this. No no

130
00:25:54,119 --> 00:26:03,349
no no. I want to test this. All right. Test. Can't test car ride entrance. Not yet built. Oh get out

131
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:08,250
of here. Entrance is right here. Exit's gonna wrap. It's gonna be a very popular ride so the

132
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:19,049
exit's gonna be this way. Okay test it. That's a lot of cars. Nice. Then you get like all it gets

133
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:50,869
all spooky in here. Why is this so slow? This is too slow. There's no draw. That's supposed to be

134
00:26:50,869 --> 00:27:06,279
a drop. Sports car. Vintage car. No make it cats. Continuous circuit. Wait for a full load. Don't

135
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:18,890
wait for a full load. All right main color scheme. Let's go. Let's see what do I want to do. All right

136
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:28,410
let's make this like... I don't like the red. That's not bad. Oh it's gonna be pretzel related

137
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:50,250
right? I'm gonna step in and say I'm not doing that. I'll be able to just say different colors

138
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:59,109
per car. Car one. No no no. Um car 20. No no no no no no no. Different color. Same. All the cars

139
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:19,849
the same color. Make it looks like blue. Nice. Okay. Play music. How much? Five miles per hour.

140
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,730
The admission price is free. All right so now we got that there. I gotta get I gotta add some

141
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:36,009
some some lush vegetation. How many how many how do we get rid of the cars? No no no no yeah yeah

142
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:46,099
yeah yeah yeah okay this this ride is fine. Close the ride. I don't know five cars? Two? Three. Five.

143
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:52,420
One two three four. I'm gonna say seven. I'm gonna say eight. Let's test that one out. That's better.

144
00:28:53,059 --> 00:29:09,930
Can I make it faster? I can't make it faster. All right so that's ready. Why is my park for babies?

145
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:21,619
Do you see how much space I have here? I need money before I I only have 5,400 bucks. You have

146
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:30,119
the cheap cheesy rides at the front and then like the real daredevils have to go around back here.

147
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:34,279
You don't want to have your kids walking all around if you got them in like strollers and stuff. No

148
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:43,259
you have all this stuff really close to the food to the the atm's and the bathrooms. Don't you

149
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:56,259
understand? All right so that one's good. Let's get a cue on it. Okay that's that. Get that fresh

150
00:29:56,259 --> 00:30:26,710
cobblestone. All right I need some decorations because I hate this. What are those trees?

151
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:43,349
These are ugly. I need like a little garden over here. Hold on. No hold on. I need a garden. I need

152
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:51,079
a little garden. That's what I need. Close this. Get this over here. Make a little circle here so

153
00:30:51,079 --> 00:31:01,339
people can walk into the garden. Right there's gonna be a couple of like a little thing here.

154
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:13,339
There's gonna be a little thing there. No that's fine. Maybe put like a shop right there. Let's

155
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:22,700
get some. Let's do that first. Get a thing here. How about a funnel cake shop right here. Right

156
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:37,160
around the corner. No right here. It's all 50. And then let's get some vegetation here.

157
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:45,339
Let's go with um people like fountains and statues and stuff right. A couple of walls.

158
00:31:46,140 --> 00:32:32,390
That's nice. And then we'll do some you know just some of this shit. That looks that looks pretty.

159
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:41,369
It does. I got the dinosaur. Funnel cake shop. And we'll uh yeah benches.

160
00:32:44,779 --> 00:33:08,420
That's under here. Uh benches. There's little benches here. Right there. Perfect. All right.

161
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:14,339
How are they gonna? What do you mean? How they sit? Oh the wall. That's for me. I'm just flying

162
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:27,559
around in my fucking helicopter. That's for me. Actually let me get some seating here. Seating

163
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:35,480
in front of the ATM. You gotta have seats and trash cans too. Next to all the food stalls. I

164
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,440
remember that was very important in this video game. Trash. Trash. Trash. Have a place to throw

165
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:48,759
you trash. All right. It's coming together pretty well. I think. This is a fun little ride. I got

166
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:56,119
my little secret like garden area. Let's get a tree over here. I don't like a couple of trees.

167
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:11,829
No I don't like those. I need some. I want bushes. Little ones. No don't like that either.

168
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:22,309
Don't need. I don't need anything over there. No I can put stores and stuff. Don't need it.

169
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:28,599
All right. So I got two rides. Here comes a good. Here comes a wild ride. All right. We're gonna do

170
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:44,409
something fun. I'm thinking the go-karts. Castle carts. I mean this one's cool. Yeah.

171
00:34:45,269 --> 00:34:59,139
Automobile antics. Vehicle design unavailable. What do you mean unavailable? Do these go fast?

172
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,420
No. I already have a cart right there. I'm not doing another cart ride.

173
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:11,429
We'll do the pirate ship. Everybody hates this. Give us the monorail. I don't have enough money

174
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:19,900
to make that. What am I spending money on? Money's being deleted. This is. I'll put this right here.

175
00:35:26,059 --> 00:36:10,179
Yeah. You want to talk about park design? Oh shit. It's the wrong way. How do I flip it? How do I

176
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:27,530
flip? I can't. I can get up there right? Usually can't you just put your cursor and it does it

177
00:36:27,530 --> 00:37:00,739
right in front? It's an oil drill. Oh okay. There we go. Damn it. It's okay. It's all right. I remember

178
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:11,340
everyone was saying this is uneven. Now I can be fixed. Uneven German. Uneven German. Right. That's

179
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:22,309
what I'm saying. So now I can fix this. Okay. So that's done. Let's go up from here. It's this

180
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:32,460
little one here. Bang. Bang. Bingo. Now that's going to be cool. Now I'm into that. All right.

181
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:39,860
So that's that. Let's spin it back around. Let's take a look at pirate ships. Swinging inverted

182
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:47,980
ship. That's all I can do. Number of swings. Swing mode. All right. Number of swings.

183
00:37:50,900 --> 00:38:03,420
Two. One. Eight. Let's increase our productivity by like 10,000 percent. Durability. All right. I want

184
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:11,219
to do. Let's do. It's kind of part of this ride in a way. Let me see what this looks like.

185
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:52,099
No. We got to do some like some actual color coordination here. This is cool. And then these

186
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:55,619
people drive down and they'll see it. And it'll be like whoa. It's like going over your head.

187
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:09,940
I need one more ride and then I'm going to open the park. Has this guy got any water? It's been

188
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:19,750
like four days. Okay. Let's go over here. Final ride that I'm going to make is going to be a

189
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,429
coaster. And it's got to be a little shitty one because I don't have enough money.

190
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:33,480
See like from 2500. Spiral. How much does this one cost? Seven thousand. Seventy two. Eleven

191
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,360
thousand. Why didn't I get one of these? Look at how awesome that is. I don't have enough money.

192
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:50,420
Now I need to make money first then. I'm ready to open the park. I need a. How's research doing?

193
00:39:51,559 --> 00:40:05,110
Take out a loan? No. That's not how you win. I need a bathroom. Let's put bathrooms. I wish I

194
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:31,460
could do it here. In fact let's do this. Let's fix this. There we go. Is that one? One more. Nice.

195
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:45,900
All right. It is time to open the park. Welcome. Except wait. Give me a janitor and an engineer.

196
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:59,780
Okay. Come on in everybody. It's only eight dollars. Welcome to Six Flags. Six Flags. How

197
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:48,789
do I change the name? Why isn't it over here? Here we go. First customer. Carl S. Oh Carl S.

198
00:41:52,340 --> 00:42:22,730
Welcome to the Big Top. I don't know. The Big Top Circus and Resort. Got it. What do you mean boo?

199
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:35,320
What's wrong with the Big Top? All right. Where are they going? People getting in line? What's

200
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,989
wrong? Recent thoughts. Where are you going? Somebody. Look at they're going. Already going

201
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:46,039
to the garden. They love it. Is this person leaving? I don't want to go on something more.

202
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,800
I want to go on something more thrilling than the ferris wheel. We'll get on the this one.

203
00:42:50,519 --> 00:43:00,070
That's what this is for. Is everybody on these rides? No they're not. They're not testing.

204
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:22,329
They're all open. Oh the pressure is starting to mount here. I'm not hungry. The in-game music.

205
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:48,219
All right. I'll turn it off. There we go. I need to name this something. The the oopsie daisy. This

206
00:43:48,219 --> 00:44:12,360
one is just ferris wheel. F wheel. This one's called. This one's called Bumperda Bumper. And

207
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:24,309
I think that's it. They're getting in line. Look. They're already riding the car. There they are.

208
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:35,860
They're so happy to be here. How much money do I have? 33,000. Nobody's in there. No thoughts on

209
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:49,110
the funnel cakes. Where are people going? I'm not thirsty. I'm not hungry. I'm tired. What would

210
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:53,110
mean I'm tired? Why are you here? I want to go something more thrilling than Bumperda Bumper.

211
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:56,230
I want to go on something more thrilling than F wheel. I'm not thirsty. I'm tired.

212
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:27,239
These are easy. Motion simulator. Film. Avenging aviators. Thrill riders.

213
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:37,000
Okay. That's fine. No music. All right. Let's go. Open it up. Open. I don't need to test it.

214
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:53,349
Open. Let's get it over there. That's thrilling. What are they saying? I'm not hungry. I'm not

215
00:45:53,349 --> 00:46:10,300
hungry. We'll get in line. This is VR. Okay. They're just walking around and not finally.

216
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:18,699
There's people getting in line for this. New vehicle available for Steel Twister. Floorless

217
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:29,750
Twister train. I need more money. It's like 50 bucks. Oh, they line it up. They actually like

218
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:36,409
this one. Look at it. It's the first line that actually has a line. Uh-oh. Oh, shit. I have to

219
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:49,269
make this longer. I'm going to charge more money. 12 bucks to get them. Oh, there we go. People

220
00:46:49,269 --> 00:47:01,030
starting to fill in here. 81 people here. I told you this was going to be a good idea.

221
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:12,119
This is not that cool though. Has anybody been buying these? Zero per hour. Burger sold zero.

222
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:24,170
Why? Is there a reason why? Too expensive? $1.40. $1.20. I mean, people have to start buying these.

223
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:37,460
90 cents. It's fine. $1.20. What are you doing? All right. What's popular right now? I've got

224
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:46,460
2,800 bucks. Don't they usually say, oh, this park is a big value? The park is really clean.

225
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:56,940
I want something more thrilling. On Oopsy-Daisy, queuing for VR sim, walking, queuing for Oopsy-Daisy.

226
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,139
People really love the Oopsy-Daisy. I should make two of these. Yeah, I'm just going to make two

227
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:53,480
of them back to back. Making sense portraits. Turn this way maybe. I think I can still do it. If I

228
00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:05,539
go like this and then like that and then can I turn it this way? Damn it. I can't just go that

229
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:14,059
way with this. Wait, I can go that way. That's not going to do it. I don't think that's going to work

230
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:45,190
though. Pulse there. Okay, hold on. Done. All right. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

231
00:49:45,190 --> 00:50:04,780
Hold on. Now this is actually kind of damn cool. I will say for myself. Now just hold on a minute

232
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:13,739
here. Look at this. Look at what I've done. Look at what I'm capable of, mom. Now check this out.

233
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:25,139
Now we've got to connect this in a very, very convincing way. So I'm going to say we can go

234
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:32,250
we gotta go around here and this is going to take us to the next part of the park.

235
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:58,860
Yep, nothing goes upside down. Okay, now just open it. Test it and open it. Try to make a third one.

236
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,380
Should I make four of these just back to back to back right here? They can't hit each other,

237
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:11,750
right? This one's going to swing for less time. Okay, let's do the same color scheme.

238
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:31,050
Looking good. So open it. That's fine. There it is. What was this called? Oopsie daisy.

239
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:36,789
Oopsie daisy. They gotta have a similar name because they're right next to each other.

240
00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:51,239
Um whoopsie daisy and whoops uh whoopsie did whoopsie oopsie daisy and whoopsie daisy.

241
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:58,280
Whatever. All right, that's done. Now that's kind of cool.

242
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:07,110
That's an attraction if I've ever seen one before and this one can hold way more people than this

243
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:12,389
one. See this is what they don't understand. This ride is faster than this one. This one's

244
00:52:12,389 --> 00:52:22,070
longer with a shorter line. This one's faster with a longer line. Now I got 2,300 bucks.

245
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:39,369
What do I want to do now with this? I want to go out here. I got 191 people here. I need to

246
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:51,420
charge more money because I'm not making anything. 15. Turn down the crowd volume. Is it too loud?

247
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:58,920
This is really starting to fill up. Everyone's realizing what's going on here. All right.

248
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:06,039
Uh do I have enough to do anything? I need like a coaster or uh I don't have enough money. I need

249
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:16,090
like a little one. Mini roller coaster. Here we go. Crazy crabs. 5,000. What if I do I need to

250
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:20,010
save this because I'm going to try to just do one that goes up down really hard and then rips around

251
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:32,809
his ends. Uh let's save it as auto save. I guess it's just auto saving. That's all right.

252
00:53:34,489 --> 00:53:45,420
All right it's auto saving. Look at how fucking huge this line is. All right here's the diabolical

253
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:56,949
plan. Are you ready? Number of swings. Oh I was gonna make it like five. Oh the the crowd's

254
00:53:56,949 --> 00:54:17,340
getting is drowning out the actual music. I see what you're saying. I'm starting to get a profit now.

255
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:33,289
Is the burger stand closed? Yeah. It's one of the fry stalls. Whatever. It's okay. I want to make a

256
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:42,389
roller coaster. I can do it. Here we go. Mini coaster. I'm gonna do my own and it's gonna be

257
00:54:42,389 --> 00:54:50,840
over here. Back here it's gonna start. It's gonna be a small one but it's gonna be crazy. That's

258
00:54:50,840 --> 00:55:01,900
enough to go up and then down right? What if I just do one car? I can delete this. I can sell it later.

259
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:24,679
No I need one now. Three. All right. Okay here we go. Here we go. That's that's fine.

260
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:41,699
I'm gonna go up with the chain. I'm watching my money closely here. Does this have a chain on it?

261
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:56,250
No it doesn't. Back it up. Back it up. Wait back it up. Okay that's it. That's it. That's it. No more.

262
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:11,219
Let's turn. A big turn. How much money? 1,900. I gotta close it now. All right then straight down.

263
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:42,519
1,500. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm just making Mario's circuit from Mario Kart Super Nintendo

264
00:56:42,519 --> 00:57:02,570
Edition. Got it. Done. Okay I got that. Now this is gonna be good. What would I just get? Oh shit.

265
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:08,250
I need. Wait wait wait. Quick. How do I make umbrellas? Umbrellas umbrellas umbrellas. Umbrellas.

266
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:51,300
Where do I get them? Hat stall. Umbrellas. Buy one. It's not open. What is obscene? I'm not sure.

267
00:57:51,300 --> 00:58:29,110
What's obscene? 10 bucks. I'm making it all back. Can you imagine going to a park and it starts to

268
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:35,989
rain and you're walking by a stall which there's a little ticker but by the second the price of the

269
00:58:35,989 --> 00:58:45,000
of the umbrella is increasing. All right let's go back down. Back down. Back down. It's fine.

270
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:52,969
Hi. The person in front of you. Hi I'd like to buy an umbrella. That'll be 14 dollars please.

271
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:58,650
No it's my turn. I'd like to buy an umbrella. That'll be 18 dollars please. Get out of here.

272
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:08,739
All right I just made a shitload of money. Let's go back to like six. Seven. Six fifty. It is now.

273
00:59:08,739 --> 00:59:16,630
This is a better park. Let's increase the price to about 25. Hell yeah. All right let's go up here

274
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:30,500
and test this coaster. Test it. What's it look like? What's it like? It's just a little one.

275
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:35,559
It's just a little guy with three. See how much how crazy this is.

276
00:59:36,760 --> 01:00:04,360
Lift hill chain speed faster than that. Let's take a look. Why is it not showing? That's pretty cool.

277
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:27,130
10 miles per hour. Is it talking this one right now? I don't understand. How fast does it go?

278
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:40,489
I mean this thing goes 45 miles per hour. This thing almost goes 50. All right that's fine. Wait.

279
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:45,420
Excitement rating medium. Intensity medium. Medium. You don't want it to be too crazy.

280
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:55,699
Okay leave maximum wait time 10 seconds. I think it's free. What about the car? I want to change

281
01:00:55,699 --> 01:01:27,769
the colors here. Can I? Yeah. That's ugly. Hold on. That's very ugly. There we go. Now I'm ready to

282
01:01:27,769 --> 01:01:35,980
open it. Let's go. I feel like there's going to be a line for this one. So we're going to do a little

283
01:01:35,980 --> 01:02:08,119
bit of an interesting squiggle here. Welcome to the ride. I'm going to call this one whatever the

284
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:22,199
name of that level is. Look at that. They're already flooding in. This is perfect. They're already

285
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:39,099
just getting in there piling in. I told you this had to be done like this. This is going to fill

286
01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:55,929
up real quick. Look at them going to the ATM. 35 bucks to get in. Let's take a look. How are we

287
01:02:55,929 --> 01:03:02,219
doing? I'm not hungry. This park is really clean. I want to go something more thrilling though. I

288
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:10,039
just got that. More thrilling. It's already here. I feel sick. Why? Where is this person?

289
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:25,670
I feel sick. Heading to bumper to bumper. This thing is so popular. Luigi's Circuit was great.

290
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:46,309
Yes it was. Wasn't it? Why is that me hungry? I have a general. Are these selling? Okay it's yeah

291
01:03:47,030 --> 01:04:06,329
five burgers have been sold. Why? Let's go this way with the park. What's wrong with you?

292
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,800
This is going to be an impossible ride to fill up. All right what have I got?

293
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:25,510
4,000. I'm turning a profit. I'm going to say we should do something else like a little

294
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:35,480
what's the word for research? Vertical shuttle cars. No I don't want to do that. I want to focus on

295
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:44,760
no shops and sceneries. No water rides. No gentle rides. Thrill rides and roller coasters and shops.

296
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:58,230
Marketing campaign. We're going to do a marketing campaign for a ride. I need another one of these.

297
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:27,260
They're getting too full. Is this going to work? This is going to crash into each other.

298
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:50,380
Give the people what they want. You know I agree. Which way do you have to be facing?

299
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:14,150
All right this is look if they want to ride it. Look at how big of a line this is. It's ridiculous.

300
01:06:15,190 --> 01:07:38,150
All right I need this. VR sim. What's wrong with it? No. There's like puke all over the place.

301
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:43,750
78 people are in this line and you guys didn't want me to do this?

302
01:07:44,630 --> 01:08:03,449
All right let's go. I need to connect it. I'll put some benches in it. Maybe a store right here.

303
01:08:04,409 --> 01:08:49,140
Fire chip. Seven. Let's get it the right color scheme. Who's trapped? All right I need another

304
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:57,579
janitor. 4,400 bucks. I'm doing great. Who's trapped? Who's trapped? Where? I want to go home.

305
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:12,119
Who? You can find your way out of here. Look at uh people. I can't keep these lines empty.

306
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:30,699
It's because I separated the roads. Yeah they're. Wait a minute. Is this fucked up? Hold on. Wait

307
01:09:30,699 --> 01:10:14,359
wait. I didn't want it like this. There we go. Everyone's fine. Where is it? Where is it? All

308
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:23,109
right. I need a janitor. I need a new janitor. Another janitor. Somewhere. We're gonna. I'm

309
01:10:23,109 --> 01:10:29,960
gonna have to have you patrol over here because it's dirty. It's fucking dirty over here. You need

310
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:46,550
to be like around here. This area. That's where you go. Still raining. I need more barrels too.

311
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:54,010
Just keep it at 20. What if somebody wants to buy one though? Like randomly just to buy one.

312
01:10:54,810 --> 01:11:03,909
They're not going to confirm buy one unless there's a reason. 10,000 dollars an hour.

313
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:22,170
Wouldn't that be nice? Look at how popular this one is. What's wrong with this? Why is

314
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:34,550
nobody on the line for this one? What's going on here? What's wrong? Nobody want to ride this one?

315
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:40,630
I'm not going on pirate ship one while it's raining. Okay I get my pirate ship one. Excuse me.

316
01:11:51,350 --> 01:12:06,420
Luigi's circuit has broken down. How? Wait. Are the people still on it? What? I need an engineer.

317
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:19,380
Why are the people still riding this? There he comes. All right good. I need one more uh one more

318
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:38,890
engineer and a security guard. Okay and barrels and more shops. Yeah I need more shops. I need

319
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:50,649
more benches. Let's get some more stores. I need I want a fountain. A giant ice cube. Uh yeah like

320
01:12:50,649 --> 01:13:01,140
right here. Look cool. That's kind of cool. That's cool just to look at. Um wait a minute.

321
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:43,939
This is too this is too cramped. I don't like it. I don't like it. It's too cramped. I don't

322
01:13:43,939 --> 01:13:53,140
can I get rid of it? I don't think I can get rid of it. Does it cost money to look at the ice cube?

323
01:13:54,100 --> 01:14:08,539
You have to crap my pants at the amusement park. Okay there it goes. I now have enough money to

324
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:14,729
make another coaster and the next coaster is going to cross across this one. You know what I'm saying?

325
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:37,140
This one's going to be fucked. Reverse freefall coaster. Check this out. Yep. How much is this?

326
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:51,930
4,000? 3,900? Now this is going to be that's pretty. Poster inside of the coaster.

327
01:14:52,729 --> 01:15:40,789
That doesn't crash right? Okay yeah it's fine. All right we gotta change the what's with the

328
01:15:40,789 --> 01:15:55,529
red platform. Okay reverse freefall car. Full load. All right you can't do anything else.

329
01:15:55,529 --> 01:16:16,010
That looks good. I wish I could change the color of that. Can I? Let's give it a test. Nice. All right.

330
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:32,340
Put more speed on it. I don't think I can. No it's already very intense. This thing goes up to 70

331
01:16:32,340 --> 01:17:07,270
miles per hour. Make it taller. That's too high. That's way too high. Is that too much? That's like

332
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:20,949
a test of strength. It doesn't even go up halfway. How do I make it go faster? I need to increase the

333
01:17:20,949 --> 01:17:49,289
power? How do I do that? Close it. Like this thing back here? It gains speed from the straight track

334
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:57,689
pieces. It's the gear tab of the ride. Yeah but I was just. No it's not. No I can't do that.

335
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:14,060
Do you want to refurbish horse mine? No. That's not there. The other gear? Yeah is it in here?

336
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:33,880
I think I have to make more of these sections. So I need to go like this then. I should have

337
01:18:33,880 --> 01:19:33,529
just made this myself. What a waste of money. Better? Let's try it. No. It's gonna have to do.

338
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:57,220
Let me take it down one two three. Now that's a real scary ride. I want it to be like you're

339
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:03,699
just about to go over it and like fly off the ride. Just barely one more. Make it like

340
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:12,010
holy shit it's going over the thing. Yeah I think that's a good idea. Let's see if it works. The

341
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:39,770
name of this ride is going to be called just barely. Oh just barely. Just barely. Any more

342
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:47,699
force and you're off. Bumper to bumper broke down? What is it? What even is bumper to bumper? Oh the

343
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:59,659
thing underneath this mess. How does this break down? Now this thing's ready to go. Okay let's get

344
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:10,380
that car. Cool. The color scheme's gotta be different. This is gonna be orange. Orange

345
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:17,380
cars to make a match with this. This track is wrong. That's better. Actually I kind of like

346
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:35,130
the orange. I like the orange. Yeah it works with this. Cool. What's the intensity by the way? Good

347
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:44,920
for rating. Very high. Yeah good luck on that one. You want intense? I'll give you intense.

348
01:21:45,720 --> 01:22:08,069
All right I think I need to. That's better. This is getting a little loud. I think it's ready to

349
01:22:08,069 --> 01:22:21,369
open as we make the kiosks. Wait how the hell do you get up and down and out of here?

350
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:52,199
Make stairs go on to here? The path in the back. Oh okay I see. This one. Ah it's the face of the

351
01:22:52,199 --> 01:23:04,119
bumper. Because you go in here and go that's the line. All right so then I fucked this up it's okay.

352
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:29,350
Okay now I'm going to connect this. The VR sim has broken down like three times.

353
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:35,029
This needs to be connected over here so we're going to build out. I think I want to go

354
01:23:36,069 --> 01:23:51,659
from here. Yeah let's build out from there. I'm gonna make this a double sidewalk. Triple sidewalk

355
01:23:51,659 --> 01:24:02,300
because this is ugly. This is very very very ugly. What have I just done? What'd I do? What'd I do?

356
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:15,029
What'd I do? What'd I do? Oh okay well please replace that. All right so that's ugly. Let's

357
01:24:15,029 --> 01:24:22,010
go up this way with it. I know everyone's gonna freak out. I got it. One two three four five six

358
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:28,010
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen. Therefore seven. One two three four

359
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:37,609
five six. Seven is the middle. One two three four five six seven. One two three four five six seven.

360
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:46,649
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen. One two

361
01:24:46,649 --> 01:25:22,170
three four five six seven. One two three four five six seven. Got it. I'm gonna have like a big display

362
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:44,090
here. That's gonna be another section of the park over this way and over here. You can find it. Get back

363
01:25:44,090 --> 01:26:02,819
over here. You know what are you doing? You can't be that stupid. Open it. There we go. I gotta put

364
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:11,060
some distraction. How much money do I have? Make this more expensive. Forty dollars to get in this

365
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:21,289
fucking park. We have to see what they think. Already getting loaded up. Is it too intense?

366
01:26:21,289 --> 01:26:36,170
No people are getting on. I caught that sneeze. Just barely. It's too intense. Just looking at

367
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:55,539
just barely makes me feel sick. People are getting on. Here we go. Whoa that was intense.

368
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:23,670
I need the bark bags out here. Click on the main gates. What about it? Park rating. Look at this

369
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:39,739
park rating. People love this place. All right looking good. Now I need to get some money. I

370
01:27:39,739 --> 01:27:55,180
have to make money. Let's increase some scenery over here because this looks terrible. Fences.

371
01:27:55,979 --> 01:28:05,720
Let's get a fence. Let's do this fence. This is a big fence. Looks good to me.

372
01:28:07,399 --> 01:28:24,199
And then I'm gonna put. Let's close off this area. Roto drop is now available. Let's go. Let's make

373
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:48,489
like a little nice garden for people to puke on. Put on the new leaf soundtrack in due time.

374
01:28:52,699 --> 01:28:56,539
Okay that looks all right. Now let's get some bushes and trees and bushes.

375
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:11,829
Maybe let's just do flowers. I'm just gonna do purple. Yeah watch this. Groups of three. One two three.

376
01:29:12,789 --> 01:29:23,210
And then I'm gonna do space space. Yes space space and then three spaces. Yellow I guess.

377
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:59,079
I'm gonna do the same thing. Space space and then space right there. We're gonna go. All right now

378
01:29:59,159 --> 01:30:12,500
I'm gonna do. Um how do these look? These are like evil. I don't want those. Uh how about

379
01:30:13,619 --> 01:30:23,689
how about these? No bushes. There we are. That's what I want. I want these fluffy ones.

380
01:30:34,859 --> 01:30:42,460
No I want like a tree. There we go. These. That's what I'm that's what I was looking for.

381
01:30:43,420 --> 01:31:04,760
Okay now I'm gonna do the same thing over here. I'm gonna add a couple things in here though.

382
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:25,539
I fucked it up. Wrong. What do you mean wrong? I fucked it up. Wrong wrong wrong. How is it wrong?

383
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:37,180
Space space. Oh right. Okay hold on. Let me. I'm gonna change it up though. Let's change it up.

384
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:46,949
Let's do red and let's do pink and um let's do pink and red. Let's do pink over here. I don't know.

385
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:00,899
Keep it symmetrical. Didn't people scream in my face when I did symmetrical?

386
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:15,880
Just barely broke down. Lined up to do this. What do you mean it broke down? Where? I had people

387
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:20,039
screaming in my face because I was doing a symmetrical garden and now all of a sudden

388
01:32:20,039 --> 01:32:39,510
you want a symmetrical garden? One two three one two. What is this? Is that a corona trigger?

389
01:32:40,310 --> 01:33:16,439
Space space space. Nice. That's. See now I did it. I don't like the way this looks though.

390
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:38,869
What's going on here? What happened? Why? This looks completely wrong.

391
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:59,939
Oh it's because they're in the middle. They're in the middle. Okay. Now we're gonna do a little

392
01:34:00,819 --> 01:34:35,989
thing in the middle I think is what I want to do. Just a little thing. Small. A duck in one of them?

393
01:34:35,989 --> 01:34:56,579
Yeah. The duck at the end. Two ducks. Double no. Double duck through the whole thing. That looks

394
01:34:56,659 --> 01:35:11,239
great. I like it. All right. That makes it look a little better I think. Maybe we should have like

395
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:23,779
a statue or something. Double wall. Is this Abe Lincoln? Who's this? What is that? Oh it's Egyptian.

396
01:35:24,739 --> 01:35:30,920
Bump it a bump. It broke down. All right. Do I have enough money? I only have $522. How did

397
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:57,850
that happen? Where did my money go? New benches. People can enjoy sitting around here and that's

398
01:35:57,850 --> 01:36:09,479
we're gonna put some soda machine over here. I think that works. Ice cold drinks. Ice cold

399
01:36:09,479 --> 01:36:15,689
pretzels. What are you doing? If they take a double water fountain I'll just sell these and

400
01:36:15,689 --> 01:36:22,310
put them over here. Now I need like a I need ice cold first aid. There's my information center.

401
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:37,460
How much are these? All right. Where's this? This is the drinks. Hot dog. Chicken. There it is.

402
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:41,779
The park has received an award for being the safest park in the country.

403
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:47,930
Oh it's it's slider.

404
01:37:00,729 --> 01:37:07,130
You know KK Slaughter to me is what I would think it would sound like if a bug sang.

405
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:11,850
Imagine you just heard this muffled through the wall and you went in there was like a

406
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:25,640
beetle just swaying back and forth. That's what I picture. Drinks and we'll do food over here.

407
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:31,079
Hot dogs. Yeah hot dogs and just a couple of drinks.

408
01:37:43,659 --> 01:38:19,180
KK Slaughter's been the most modern pop music. Oh shit a bug. So uh chicken too. I'm gonna go

409
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:39,000
let me I need a first aid room. I really do. Should I put it though? I don't I don't like

410
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,220
this the symmetry over here. First aid should probably be on the in front of the rides of the

411
01:38:44,220 --> 01:39:05,029
most dangerous. What do you guys think? Yeah let's put it over here. First is first aid free? I guess

412
01:39:05,029 --> 01:39:15,859
yeah. It's just available in case somebody pukes. Imagine going to a roller coaster and right outside

413
01:39:15,859 --> 01:39:28,010
the entrance is a medical tent. Yeah that's actually pretty scary. F wheels broken down.

414
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:33,779
Uh oh. Is it time to liquidate this thing? This is not even the right color scheme.

415
01:39:34,500 --> 01:40:02,520
What am I thinking? All right I wanted the fountains over here. Can I get it? Can I pick it up?

416
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:16,260
No it's just it's in a weird spot. Why did I put these here? Got it all right. Can I get the other

417
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:26,090
one? I'm pretty slick. People really like the ice cube. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

418
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:32,409
wait. Put more benches here. What an attraction. Everybody was supposed to sit in front of the ice

419
01:40:32,409 --> 01:40:44,329
cube. All right look it. You got at least two, four, five, six people here. Should I do a second cube?

420
01:40:50,439 --> 01:41:02,840
Why not? That's 25 bucks. All right I wanted to put fountains here. Here and here maybe.

421
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:13,859
The tornado is a little distracting. Oh I like that. That's nice. What could this go?

422
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:17,659
That's actually I kind of I like it.

423
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:56,220
Didn't go all the way. Oops. No my garden. No that's fine. What's this bug?

424
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:04,060
Volcano? We're gonna have some cool. We have to have things that they go by, right? What are these?

425
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:50,890
Are these fireworks? Okay. I need to stop spending money. Put on some music. Okay.

426
01:43:51,529 --> 01:44:05,640
Which I put on. I need some rain. I know. Come on. When's it gonna rain? Mario 3D world.

427
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:29,770
3D world. Don't I hate this game? Which is the one that I don't like? Mario. Super Mario 3D world LST.

428
01:44:30,329 --> 01:44:48,140
Oh this is bopping. Okay so how are we doing? Let's take a look at the. Let's get a good view

429
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:55,579
of what's going on here. I've been queuing for Luigi's Circuit for ages. I need more cars.

430
01:44:56,380 --> 01:45:04,020
I gotta. I need more cars. I gotta close this down because people look. Look at this. Everyone hates

431
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:20,789
this. I need to go to the bathroom. What do you mean? This bathroom? That's 10 cents right? I have

432
01:45:20,789 --> 01:45:34,010
to go to the bathroom. I have to go to the bathroom. Uh I guess I'm gonna make some more bathrooms.

433
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:57,539
Are they just standing in line? That's their problem? I'm not hungry. I've already got a cuddly toy.

434
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:08,970
This park is really clean. I'm not thirsty. Whoops daisy. Whoops daisy was great.

435
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:18,409
Okay so Luigi's Circuit is taking too long. I'm gonna make the. I'm sorry. I have to do this.

436
01:46:18,409 --> 01:46:23,449
It's gonna be bad but I have to do it. Ladies and gentlemen Luigi's Circuit is now closed

437
01:46:25,689 --> 01:47:44,680
for maintenance. I'm gonna add a couple of cars here. Bingo. Six cars. How long is the ride?

438
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:54,569
Max leave if another train arrives at the station. Wait for. Okay I think we're good. We've got more

439
01:47:54,569 --> 01:48:07,619
cars. I think that's good. I think it's good to go. Open it up. It's back open. We've got three

440
01:48:07,619 --> 01:48:40,010
extra cars. What do you mean music? This is uh guys this is. What song is this? I don't know.

441
01:48:40,569 --> 01:48:52,119
This isn't even closed. What? I don't know what this is. This is called Super Mario World OST Extended.

442
01:48:52,920 --> 01:49:14,100
How about Beat Block Skyway? That's next in line. It's the same song. Hold on. Wait what's wrong?

443
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:21,460
Why people not going on the ride? Is this going faster? What's going on? People don't want to

444
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:33,579
get on this ride anymore. Why not? I don't. Why you guys think I know what like a porn song is?

445
01:49:33,579 --> 01:49:50,060
It's Mario 3D World. What are you talking about? Okay um what's what is a what's a what's a

446
01:49:50,060 --> 01:50:49,699
relaxing one? Stardew? How about Dune? That sounds pretty good. Okay uh I want to build another

447
01:50:49,699 --> 01:50:59,699
coaster but I don't have any money. Should I make a fourth one of these? No. No one's even riding it.

448
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:14,300
There we go. Now let people in line. Take out a loan. I hate doing that. I really hate taking out

449
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:43,699
loans. Um I'm actually I'm in I'm not in the red loan. I can't. I gotta wait. This is freaking

450
01:51:43,699 --> 01:52:01,909
me out. I don't want something. I'm putting on fucking Mario RPG. There we go. Guests are

451
01:52:01,909 --> 01:52:13,430
complaining about the disgusting state of the park. What are you talking about? Where? I don't know

452
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:23,800
what you mean by that. Okay now I want to put the game sounds back up a little because I like to

453
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:39,579
hear like a little. That's a nice level. People are not shitting. All right there's plenty of

454
01:52:39,579 --> 01:52:50,149
bathrooms. I need another janitor. Oh it's this. All right what did not there's a janitor that's

455
01:52:50,149 --> 01:53:08,890
doing this isn't there? Where are you? Who's the one that has the path? It's you. What's your path?

456
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:12,170
Oh well add this to your path.

457
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:44,180
This game is so good. If the guy doesn't have a path. Yeah he can just wander. All right you take

458
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:53,689
care of that like the front end here. Are you still just what does that egg mean? Walking to egg?

459
01:53:53,689 --> 01:54:00,729
Oh no no no he's an astronaut. Right okay. I think it's time to change to a panda.

460
01:54:01,689 --> 01:54:18,520
It looks good. There we go. Clean it up. Make it look nicer. Would I ever stream it? I've

461
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:24,149
I've beat this game probably like 40 times. I don't know if I'd be able to add very much

462
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:33,750
but I have we've talked about before. Who cares? Just kind of do it. All right. All right well hold

463
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:41,159
on. I need to do it. I need some. I got 2400 bucks. Can I fast forward time? You can do this?

464
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:54,010
Try to just do this really fast and until I can build a new coaster? Because I want to build a

465
01:54:54,010 --> 01:55:02,260
giant one. It's time for the monorail. I think it's time. Can you imagine? I was going to go

466
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:12,699
around this whole thing with the monorail. It's time. Monorail. Or how about a choo-choo train?

467
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:33,770
Elevator? It's got to be back. The path. There's going to be a path that leads down here

468
01:55:35,130 --> 01:55:43,210
to somewhere over here. And we go around this whole thing. I don't have to finish the whole

469
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:58,779
thing right now. Yeah this is the best soundtrack for any Mario game. Well I will hold that up.

470
01:55:58,779 --> 01:56:09,670
Track to track to any Mario game you've ever played. All right let's go back here. Now let's

471
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:23,399
go up. Up, up, up, up, up. Up, up, up, up. Good. Wait. Okay. So they get a good view.

472
01:56:25,079 --> 01:56:48,890
No that's not necessary. Just go around the whole thing. Here's the intro. Go around. I'm

473
01:56:48,890 --> 01:57:09,829
almost out of money. I don't have to finish it yet. I can wait. It's just this is like I'm

474
01:57:09,829 --> 01:57:28,550
making like a prison. Fuck negative 44. What do I do? Delete? No I'm gonna wait. Just wait.

475
01:57:29,350 --> 01:58:09,770
There we go. Okay positive again. This is gonna be cool. Ready? Watch this.

476
01:58:10,489 --> 01:58:43,239
Don't pack it up. Really? Come on. I thought I could do this. I gotta go back. It's gotta go

477
01:58:43,239 --> 01:59:04,229
across this way. Is that too low? That's not too low right? Is that too low? That's not too low?

478
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:08,279
Oh it's if you stand up.

479
01:59:11,689 --> 01:59:21,449
Okay it's fine. It's not too low. We're good. Straight ahead. I might have to change that a

480
01:59:21,449 --> 02:00:05,560
little. No. Ugly. Ugly. Is it where Toad explains you how to play the game? Tutorial Toad comes in.

481
02:00:29,770 --> 02:01:05,500
Damn it. Do a Toad impression. Got it. Monorail is done. Retro style. Yeah. No that's ugly. Four

482
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:12,579
trains. Five cars per train. What does that mean? Continuous shuttle mode? What a shuttle mode.

483
02:01:15,989 --> 02:01:20,390
Reliability. All right. This is we gotta change this. This is gonna be orange. We got too much

484
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:43,430
blue. Like orange. We're gonna make this like a little like a gray. No. That's better. Less

485
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:52,460
assuming. Station style wood. No. Something something new. Something something daring.

486
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:58,539
There we go. Pretzels. All vehicles of the same color. We're gonna make these orange and

03:02:16,389 --> 03:02:23,899
testing this again my mouse my my new mouse coaster where is it close it and open it back up

660

03:02:44,579 --> 03:02:56,250
this ever again no i don't want to open it i want to test it nobody's in the cube yeah i know

662
03:02:58,360 --> 03:03:08,840
it's because it crashed you need to repair it let me go through and find out where it would

663
03:03:08,840 --> 03:03:15,430
uh crash again let's see so it looks like here it goes i fixed that one so it's gonna go down

664
03:03:15,430 --> 03:03:23,190
wrap around then go up i think it'll make it up that down catch up caught i think it'll be fine

though okay let's try it again here we go all right come on work work work work work work

666
03:03:50,889 --> 03:04:05,719
there we go first drop passes by over here chain added all right we haven't seen this before

667
03:04:06,520 --> 03:04:26,459
it goes around down and around come on keep going delete delete delete delete delete delete

668
03:04:26,459 --> 03:04:31,739
delete delete delete delete delete it stop stop stop stop stop okay so right here i need a chain

669
03:04:31,739 --> 03:04:49,190
here like right here so like right here needs to be a chain right i think that makes sense

670
03:04:57,139 --> 03:05:16,709
that simulate the ride oh that's helpful i didn't even know that was possible delete delete delete

671
03:05:16,709 --> 03:05:27,500
delete delete delete so it'll get caught there slowly fall over here and then that should be it

672
03:05:28,219 --> 03:05:51,860
there it goes and around no it's got to be this one here damn it this is bad i'm gonna have to

673
03:05:51,860 --> 03:06:06,250
change this whole thing here it's got to be straight like this on the chain on the chain

674
03:06:09,239 --> 03:06:23,159
chain turn it turn it hard turn it hard and that's it right there oh what how was that

675
03:06:23,159 --> 03:06:32,139
possible what did i do i screwed that up bad that's not it right there damn it look at that

676
03:06:32,139 --> 03:07:22,649
looks perfect i think i have to do it from here straighten it out chain on straight bang a no

677
03:07:22,649 --> 03:07:31,290
straight again turn turn straight and then here i need to get over here

678
03:07:32,250 --> 03:07:43,209
i need to get rid of this how do i get on the other side i want to like get over this way but

679
03:07:43,209 --> 03:08:01,370
i can't get over there i really have to go all the way around all right that should help

680
03:08:02,170 --> 03:09:07,670

711
03:21:23,319 --> 03:21:28,520
the second one of these that's when it went off and then i just tried to see how many things i

712
03:21:28,520 --> 03:21:32,280

749
03:36:29,579 --> 03:36:42,180
on here are these not let me see here hold on it's the chain right so chain chain the chain is still

750
03:36:42,180 --> 03:36:50,389
on we're gonna we're gonna turn and then close it so what happened there what's the problem

751
03:36:51,190 --> 03:37:18,629
i don't understand what are you doing why is it stuck chain adds act as a block brake i thought

752
03:37:18,709 --> 03:37:33,450
the chain pulls it up the isn't the chain supposed to pull it up you need block brake when you have

753
03:37:33,450 --> 03:37:55,979
two trains there's a train stuck further along wait hold on the way this is what you're talking

754
03:37:55,979 --> 03:38:26,170
about okay so i have to go over here and take these brakes out here the boosters aren't fat

755
03:38:26,250 --> 03:38:32,459
they're 170 miles per hour what do you mean they're not fast enough okay here's boost

756
03:38:34,469 --> 03:38:43,379
so right here is where it needs to go out so let's go like this i need to get rid of these

757
03:38:43,379 --> 03:38:55,690
i think these are all brakes right boost boost boost boost boost boost done faster i can't go

758
03:38:55,690 --> 03:39:03,020
faster that's not gonna happen all right turn it on we're good all right we're good let's try it

759
03:39:03,020 --> 03:40:03,059
again multiple weeks this is like taking a trip to the moon it took weeks to get and it takes

760
03:40:03,059 --> 03:40:32,149
weeks to get down oh my god that would be horrible holy shit i can't believe it didn't crash

761
03:40:32,950 --> 03:40:47,340
these people yeah these people would be liquefied max speed 120 miles per hour

762
03:40:56,229 --> 03:41:10,059
let's see the let's see the g's vertical g's like skull cracks let's see

763
03:41:31,190 --> 03:41:35,670
your stomach goes into the fucking back of your throat

764
03:41:35,670 --> 03:42:16,629
oh my god all right it works open for business i wonder if anyone will get on this i love how

765
03:42:16,629 --> 03:42:30,979
this is parallel to the monorail this thing's gonna go by so fast this is gonna blow other

766
03:42:30,979 --> 03:42:46,520
stuff over no one's gonna ride this i still i got 13 grams still all right it's still

767
03:42:47,399 --> 03:42:56,840
3d cinema has done what it's all right so what about a scenario where i change this

768
03:42:58,500 --> 03:43:08,229
and i make it go all the way down here slow drops slow drops and just make a gigantic snake

769
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:16,459
and you actually are on the ride for like two or three months what's my park rating

770
03:43:16,459 --> 03:43:26,149
people are left people left sorry yeah i got too concentrated over here i this was starting to be

771
03:43:26,149 --> 03:43:43,909
all right and then i just just this happened and i i lost control completely hold on let me do

772
03:43:43,909 --> 03:43:47,989
something over here let me at least spread this out a little bit so it's not like concentrated

773
03:43:48,629 --> 03:43:53,670
nonsense all right how about i want to do an actual cool roller coaster one that i actually

774
03:43:53,670 --> 03:44:01,700
would be proud of bobsled coaster that's pretty cool that's really cool i want to i want to make

775
03:44:01,700 --> 03:44:21,450
one a bobsled coaster all right let's make this for real let's say what can i do on ride photo

776
03:44:21,450 --> 03:44:36,809
okay let's go up let's go let's get let's go up this way they're already 20 bucks

777
03:44:41,450 --> 03:44:54,340
just gently go up like that okay not too anything nothing too ridiculous at first

778
03:44:54,340 --> 03:45:05,579
let's just go up a little bit like this drop that bend it to the maybe maybe give it a nice turn

779
03:45:05,579 --> 03:45:34,340
here i want a big cup all right interesting charge higher for umbrellas i can't there

780
03:45:35,219 --> 03:45:43,739
and then i want it to go up again so that's it this is the first little bit of an oops

781
03:45:43,739 --> 03:45:51,579
you know like up bend it this way check this out ready so make it a little bit of a of a

782
03:45:51,579 --> 03:46:20,579
tilt scenario like this come on you can do it come on okay bend it again a little

783
03:46:23,319 --> 03:46:29,239
now we're going to go on part two here part two is chain i think that's enough speed it might not

784
03:46:29,239 --> 03:46:43,500
move i hope it is up up again higher that's all right right there's fine it looks good now let's

785
03:46:43,500 --> 03:47:16,729
really bend that twist it down i ran out of money that's good enough and then bring it down

786
03:47:17,690 --> 03:47:28,489
let's bend it over this way i think i can go up can i go up and over yeah i should be able to turn

787
03:47:28,489 --> 03:47:40,489
it one more time i got five grand still those things are so expensive bank it again straighten

788
03:47:40,489 --> 03:47:55,299
it out down we're going to wrap it back this way one more time slow it up come in for the close

789
03:47:56,020 --> 03:48:14,100
go down with it this way harder right there drop it at the very end connected all right

790
03:48:17,020 --> 03:48:18,940
and i'm putting i'm putting like a statue up here

791
03:48:29,770 --> 03:48:52,329
test it how does it work i like the little pretzel here

792
03:48:53,690 --> 03:49:10,010
how are you guys getting a dick out of this this if this is a dick then i don't that would be

793
03:49:10,090 --> 03:49:20,659
uh an issue i think i would that were never mind all right it made it around the first pretzel

794
03:49:21,379 --> 03:50:11,299
come on what kind of dick this listen that is not a dick it's if anything oh

795
03:50:13,530 --> 03:50:21,290
all right so i had trouble i need to make this a little smaller let's go this way with it

796
03:50:22,329 --> 03:50:30,809
i'm gonna say um i'm gonna say um so over here this needs to be straightened out

797
03:50:31,530 --> 03:50:45,530
so we're gonna go forward with it wait i think i can go like this

798
03:50:46,409 --> 03:51:01,750
it should do it all right get over that first hump just then i can go up this chain here there's

799
03:51:01,750 --> 03:51:10,940
no way it's gonna go up this this has to be a chain as well no way not gonna happen you know

800
03:51:11,020 --> 03:51:35,540
i mean you know what i'm saying you know what i mean this has to be a chain this whole thing

801
03:51:35,540 --> 03:52:00,069
is just gonna go away and then down what's the size on this guy 40 feet 40 feet i got it right

802
03:52:00,069 --> 03:52:10,680
there tighter 40 feet 40 feet straight ahead how's that 40 feet that's not even 40 feet what are you

803
03:52:10,680 --> 03:52:20,620
talking about it's not 40 feet that's not 40 feet how's that 40 feet that's not 40 feet what's

804
03:52:20,620 --> 03:52:52,729
going on there that's not 40 feet that's bullshit double click what does that do

805
03:52:53,450 --> 03:53:13,450
damn money is that it is it going in there all right does that does that work does that help me

806
03:53:13,450 --> 03:54:53,219
out there i think it does ladies and gentlemen tested i'm sorry i forgot i was streaming is that

807
03:54:53,219 --> 03:55:16,139
but from this angle it's also incorrect did i just get it what is happening 50 50 feet just go

808
03:55:16,139 --> 03:55:24,629
forward 50 50 straight ahead you've done it you've done it now you can play the game now son

809
03:55:25,979 --> 03:56:04,540
thanks dad please cost end this unholy stream why would you ever want that to happen what happened

810
03:56:04,540 --> 03:56:17,219
you you've failed your objective oh whatever i don't care look at how slow this is it's not

811
03:56:17,219 --> 03:56:21,219
going to be enough this has to be a chain or something this is so slow it's not going to

812
03:56:21,219 --> 03:56:30,520
happen i gotta just delete these makings chain is this little oomph gonna be enough

813
03:56:31,239 --> 03:57:43,799
open it i don't care come on now people are gonna be fine there's no there's nothing there's no

814
03:57:43,799 --> 03:57:52,500
enclosed thing that's good can i define momentum when you go uh when you're going forward at a

815
03:57:52,500 --> 03:58:01,379
certain speed and when you're the way to slow yourself down you're going your weight is pushing

816
03:58:01,379 --> 03:58:12,379
forward so there's you have that extra you know um i can't talk right now it's forward motion

817
03:58:13,180 --> 03:58:18,379
and the momentum is like your weight combined with how fast you're moving forward and then if

818
03:58:18,379 --> 03:58:21,979
there's no more engine running you turn the engine off and you're still going forward you're still

819
03:58:21,979 --> 03:58:42,440
going to move forward because you have momentum oh he's leaving us in the realm i just wanted to

820
03:58:42,440 --> 03:58:52,920
work uh this is my fifth year running this place this has been a nostalgia trip though it really

821
03:58:52,920 --> 03:59:09,030
has i'm doing this same exact shit is anybody even riding this see this is fun you go around

822
03:59:09,030 --> 03:59:18,090
one two then you go to the drop yeah this is a fun coaster this is not like broken or bad i

823
03:59:18,090 --> 03:59:24,139
screwed up or anything i mean people people have you all you know you killed somebody no i didn't

824
03:59:52,489 --> 03:59:58,709
this person's still in line do you really want to go on this

825
04:00:01,290 --> 04:00:06,420
you sure that you want to go on this ride you really i just want to make sure you're aware

826
04:00:06,420 --> 04:00:34,200
of what happens when you're on this i can't even whatever at the very very very end

827
04:00:52,870 --> 04:01:12,940
why would it explode here of all the places here look how slow this goes too much wiggle at the end

828
04:01:53,459 --> 04:01:58,180
no i got it wrong make more of the dinosaur statues you know that's not a bad idea

829
04:02:55,559 --> 04:03:00,360
okay i have so much trouble with this i've roller coaster tycoon 3 you just hit the auto

830
04:03:00,360 --> 04:03:03,399
button and it does it i didn't i didn't play this one as much as i played three

831
04:03:45,610 --> 04:04:07,500
i'm gonna fucking lose my mind this is like doing a three-point turn in like a parking lot

832
04:04:08,139 --> 04:05:53,000
it's like parallel parking a car end of sanity no i'm fine although i'm probably gonna stop

833
04:05:53,000 --> 04:06:07,129
streaming soon though it's getting late all right somebody get on it it's safe i promise

834
04:06:07,930 --> 04:06:32,360
what's the problem why does nobody want to ride it what's the issue you made it around good up

835
04:06:33,219 --> 04:06:38,180
around goes all the way around comes over here and that's it is the engineer gonna ride it

836
04:06:50,360 --> 04:07:02,090
it goes slower than the people are walking temporarily ride sucks lol true did you just

837
04:07:03,049 --> 04:07:05,129

838
04:07:18,360 --> 04:07:26,309
here we go cool bends on the bobsled somebody waiting in line it is safe plenty of time for

839
04:07:26,309 --> 04:07:42,600
this to slow down around a little bend done it's safe to ride get on welcome oh ride sucks yeah

840

all right it's been fun i think i'm done streaming for today why does your theme park

842
04:08:30,459 --> 04:08:38,250
why does your theme park look like the cables behind my tv well that's a great question viewer

843
04:08:39,540 --> 04:08:54,170
the answer is not so simple nobody riding the tree either why is it closed no

844
04:08:54,489 --> 04:08:58,569
there's a ride back here that's been closed the whole time where are my rides where's my ride

845
04:08:58,569 --> 04:09:17,219
overlay now the duality of chat i'm hungry i'm not hungry it's not closed it's just unpopular no

846
04:09:17,219 --> 04:09:29,479
it's closed where is my list where's my list broken down the big tree i just saw it move up

847
04:09:29,479 --> 04:10:01,659
and down what are you talking about how is it broken down all right it's open people like this

848
04:10:01,659 --> 04:10:09,819
one and you guys said this is a shitty coaster look at how wrong that was we already got a line

853
04:13:44,200 --> 04:13:55,260

855
04:14:16,809 --> 04:14:35,110

867
04:18:58,899 --> 04:19:05,270
hundred thousand dollars only the tree and the monorail and this mess well that was actually a

868
04:19:05,270 --> 04:19:10,389
lot of fun i had i actually had a really good time this was a fun game up until uh the last

869
04:19:10,389 --> 04:19:19,020
probably 45 minutes to an hour when i just uh i just lost my mind why is my rating so bad

870
04:19:19,020 --> 04:19:24,139
because i started to do this and i also just like 10 people just drowned

871
04:19:34,920 --> 04:19:43,370
oh this is so funny what a fun game but that's gonna be it for me we're gonna do the bits

872
04:19:44,010 --> 04:19:54,459
which would cost tickets well before i go let me see one more thing that this

873
04:19:55,420 --> 04:20:07,049
close this you can go even higher 345 feet oh my god there's buildings aren't even this tall

874
04:20:07,930 --> 04:20:21,059
can they can you add anything to this refurbish vertical tower entry no there's nothing you just

875
04:20:21,059 --> 04:20:36,459
do the vertical tower i did enjoy making the tree so if there's um i i did want to try to get the

876
04:20:36,540 --> 04:20:45,350
twitch integration to work but sadly they shut it down like last year so i'm gonna look into

877
04:20:45,350 --> 04:20:53,909
having a server because what happens is people in chat are people in the game every single person

878
04:20:53,909 --> 04:21:00,059
in here is somebody from chat is how that integration works that would be really fun

879
04:21:00,860 --> 04:21:12,010
and i would play this again if i could get that to work but i do need to set up my own server

880
04:21:12,010 --> 04:21:25,850
which i kind of have to figure that out but uh in the meantime i'm gonna call it here we're

881
04:21:25,850 --> 04:21:35,590
gonna do the bits and i will see you guys in a couple days today is wednesday i will see you guys

882
04:21:35,590 --> 04:21:44,250
on saturday so i'll see you guys saturday and sunday this weekend we've got some interesting

883
04:21:44,250 --> 04:21:50,950
things to do saturday and sunday is going to be hopefully the internet works because every saturday

884
04:21:50,950 --> 04:21:54,389
and sunday stream everyone always gets shut down by cox for some weird reason but we're gonna try

885
04:21:54,389 --> 04:22:07,100
it anyways we're gonna do connect i have just under 30 40 connect games ranging from ones that

886
04:22:07,100 --> 04:22:13,030
are probably fun to ones that are probably be played for about eight minutes and then

887
04:22:13,030 --> 04:22:26,780
immediately taken up that's gonna be on saturday i am preparing myself for that if you have an

888
04:22:26,780 --> 04:22:36,680
idea of a game i i have it i went through meticulously and purchased every single connect

889
04:22:36,680 --> 04:22:42,440
game that i thought would be even remotely interesting on stream there's 40 of them

890
04:22:44,760 --> 04:22:54,950
almost every single one we are going to do that for saturday and sunday i don't know how long

891
04:22:54,950 --> 04:23:02,299
that's going to take us i don't know exactly how far we'll get through them we may need to add

892
04:23:02,299 --> 04:23:13,610
another day i don't know but thanks for joining me i'll see you guys on saturday take care see you

929
04:29:27,399 --> 04:29:33,420
250 hey germa i worked a teenage job this past summer in an ice cream shop which means i've

930
04:29:33,420 --> 04:29:38,059
earned enough to tell you how much i appreciate your streams vodz highlights in you i know it's

931
04:29:38,059 --> 04:29:43,180
hard to appreciate your viewers due to their incomprehensible scale but i want you to know

932
04:29:43,180 --> 04:29:47,819
you make one 16-year-old rhode islanders life a lot better with your work good luck to you for

new england i miss it all the time but good luck thank you amazing sponge for the 250

935
04:30:19,319 --> 04:30:27,059
and as the channel grows i do i never want to lose that aspect of

936
04:30:28,600 --> 04:30:36,219
people just becoming numbers it can be hard sometimes to essentially let's say you do this

937
04:30:36,219 --> 04:30:45,579
in this you know two three four five thousand people here it's hard to individualize everybody

938
04:30:45,579 --> 04:30:53,129
but i don't really i don't want to have that scenario where people adjust numbers it just i

939
04:30:53,129 --> 04:31:11,510
don't know it freaks me out a little but then on the other hand right it's it's sometimes it can

940
04:31:11,510 --> 04:31:18,780
kind of be overwhelming sometimes if you think about it not this kind of thing but just trying

941
04:31:18,780 --> 04:31:29,799
to go over in my head the just how many people might may or may not be here but over the years

942
04:31:29,799 --> 04:31:35,319
i've it if there's five thousand ten thousand five hundred thousand people here i would be

943
04:31:35,319 --> 04:31:41,479
i would act the same i wouldn't really change anything i feel like i haven't really done i

944
04:31:41,479 --> 04:31:46,840
haven't really changed who i am as a person i don't think since starting this i think i've

945
04:31:46,840 --> 04:32:03,850
been pretty much the same as i was from 100 views on a youtube video to people watching this maybe

946
04:32:03,850 --> 04:32:09,670
i have maybe a little not that i've been able to see and look in the mirror and go you've changed

947
04:32:10,229 --> 04:32:14,309
i don't know maybe that's the talk of the villain that is changing i don't

948
04:32:17,020 --> 04:32:22,729
but thank you gnarly for the 250 you playing super mario rpg ost makes me want to see you

949
04:32:22,729 --> 04:32:29,690
play another mario rpg like paper mario or the mario and luigi series those are some of my

950
04:32:29,690 --> 04:32:37,719
favorite games ever the mario and luigi series believe it or not is made by some of the same

951
04:32:37,719 --> 04:32:43,959
people that made super mario rpg same director right there's a alpha dream maybe the developers

952
04:32:43,959 --> 04:32:56,100
that released back when they were doing that i think that's accurate i have played superstar

953
04:33:02,549 --> 04:33:05,990
and i've not played the other ones though i would probably like them

954
04:33:06,549 --> 04:33:20,139
but yeah i wasn't that big of a fan of paper mario not really i respect paper mario but i

955
04:33:20,139 --> 04:33:33,880
don't really enjoy playing paper mario i respect it but i don't really it didn't grab me like the

956
04:33:33,880 --> 04:33:41,900
other ones did that may have changed since i've grown older maybe i will appreciate it now than

957
04:33:41,900 --> 04:33:57,979
i did maybe 10 15 years ago i don't know but that was uh gnarly smelly boy thanks for the 250

958
04:33:57,979 --> 04:34:01,979
smelly boy germa you're insane if you don't think we'd all watch you do a playthrough of super mario

959
04:34:01,979 --> 04:34:08,619
rpg seriously what you did for sorcery and played uh seriously do what you did for sorcery and play

960
04:34:08,619 --> 04:34:14,540
it over the course of a couple weeks like every other stream it would be great uh mario rpg is

961
04:34:14,540 --> 04:34:22,549
not that long of a game it's you could probably get through the whole thing especially if you know

962
04:34:22,549 --> 04:34:27,509
what you're doing and where you're going in seven to ten hours i don't think it would take that

963
04:34:27,509 --> 04:34:41,799
long maybe maybe a little bit longer 12 hours maybe should i should i just do it should i

964
04:34:42,439 --> 04:34:57,380
what do you think should i do it should i stream super mario rpg yeah i mean yeah of course i'll

965
04:34:57,380 --> 04:35:01,380
love it i haven't i'd be you know when you find that game that you love and it's like one of your

966
04:35:01,380 --> 04:35:08,020
favorite games ever made and somehow you stumble into it and end up playing it again every few

967
04:35:08,020 --> 04:35:17,020
years i have played super mario rpg and beaten it probably yeah like more than 20 30 times

968
04:35:17,020 --> 04:35:25,540
i play through it probably once every couple years yeah let's do it that would be a chill just

969
04:35:25,540 --> 04:35:37,750
stream or two yeah let's do it why not we'll do that after connect yeah fuck yeah let's do it

970
04:35:37,750 --> 04:35:43,830
let's do it i'm ready that music too just made me want to play i want to go down the the river

971
04:35:43,909 --> 04:35:53,979
again and collect the coins yeah after the connect weekend we'll settle down and i'll play through

972
04:35:53,979 --> 04:36:03,299
mario rpg still gonna do the gta online casino i still am looking for people to play it there's

973
04:36:03,299 --> 04:36:07,779
like three or four other streamers that i'm through a line out to and i'm trying to see if we can set

974
04:36:07,779 --> 04:36:12,419
something up i think that's more fun with other people like streamers or youtubers whatever not

975
04:36:12,419 --> 04:36:31,770
youtubers we don't i mean she got ghosted it's real money don't they give you like a fake currency

976
04:36:31,770 --> 04:36:39,110
to use for a little while don't forget sam and max the thing about sam and max is the last couple

977
04:36:39,110 --> 04:36:47,209
times i was thinking of doing it i was on a poll and people nobody voted for it that's why i'm kind

978
04:36:47,209 --> 04:36:54,040
i'm kind of waiting i think we hit sam and max exhaustion because i played through both the first

979
04:36:54,040 --> 04:36:59,880
two seasons pretty close to each other i think we may have seen some sam and max exhaustion

980
04:37:00,599 --> 04:37:17,639
so i'm just gonna keep it in the pocket for a little while we'll go back to it we will i'm

981
04:37:17,639 --> 04:37:21,720
not just gonna start it and not finish it especially the fact that it's the third season

982
04:37:21,720 --> 04:37:33,689
and i did the first two full seasons thank you lemon pudding for the 250 germa apologize publicly

983
04:37:33,689 --> 04:37:40,409
to fortnight jimmy 2010 for what you did yesterday or i'm gonna tell grill master barbecue about it

984
04:37:40,409 --> 04:37:52,549
and this time he will ruin your career grill master bbq i don't think it's streamed in like

985
04:37:52,549 --> 04:38:09,880
seven or eight months so i mean okay he turned it on once he winked at the camera like 15 times

986
04:38:10,759 --> 04:38:16,119
over the course of about 14 minutes he sat there for about 15 minutes he winked like three four five

987
04:38:16,119 --> 04:38:23,020
six times few minutes went by he winked and then he turned the stream off i didn't know what he

988
04:38:23,020 --> 04:38:27,819
was but i think he was part of his he did this thing whereas he did a big arg on his channel

989
04:38:28,700 --> 04:38:33,509
and he really got way over his head with it he had the hours and hours of arg footage on his

990
04:38:33,509 --> 04:38:37,990
channel and he was he was doing something with the twitch thing i think it got too much for him

991
04:38:37,990 --> 04:38:48,919
and he didn't want to do it anymore so he decided not to do it anymore i guess i was keeping up a

992
04:38:48,919 --> 04:39:02,490
little bit hey thank you raddest raccoon for the 250 hey germa germa chomp just want to tell you

the ds what was the last animal crossing on the 3ds i put it i did put some time into that i put

1024
04:44:03,689 --> 04:44:14,009
probably maybe 30 hours 40 hours into that one that is newly okay i never streamed it it was

1025
04:44:14,650 --> 04:44:23,319
it was just something i just sat around in bed playing 30 hours is yeah that's not a lot yeah

1026
04:44:23,319 --> 04:44:29,939
but it was that's a lot for lying in bed for an hour and playing it for 30 days in a row

1027
04:44:34,700 --> 04:44:43,689
when the new one comes out i'm not sure i would stream it maybe i would yeah i played that game

1028
04:44:43,689 --> 04:44:58,500
for a month straight a full month oh i'm just realizing something this stream title i was

1029
04:44:58,500 --> 04:45:03,380
going to change it event where i didn't say i was going to change that it was just roller coaster

1030
04:45:03,380 --> 04:45:19,659
tycoon 2 that's the most unclickable title you could ever have whatever this is the name of the

1031
04:45:19,659 --> 04:45:26,090
game when the name of the game is underneath the stream so my stream in the browse page was

1032
04:45:26,090 --> 04:45:41,450
roller coaster tycoon 2 roller coaster tycoon 2 good that's great that's a very safe normal title

1033
04:45:44,139 --> 04:45:51,689
hey i still clicked it all right good yeah that's the kind of title where somebody comes in and if

1034
04:45:51,689 --> 04:45:58,759
they ask the name of the game there is a 100 chance that they're just fucking with you

1035
04:46:07,979 --> 04:46:16,439
but uh i will see you guys in a couple days for the start of the connect weekend i will see you
