1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:07,429
You didn't get scammed. I'm here. You didn't get scammed.

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:14,570
Uh oh. Uh oh. No, no, no, no, no. Don't tell me I have to change servers again. Don't even do that.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,129
I just turned it on. Don't even tell me I have to change servers.

4
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:26,789
Come on, man. We'll see.

5
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:34,659
You know, every couple weeks I have to change my Twitch server.

6
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,579
Because... I don't know.

7
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,020
It doesn't like where my connection's coming from, apparently.

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,020
But hello! How are you? Good to see you.

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,829
What's up? I'm doing good.

10
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:53,229
Talk about baseball? I just wait. We're gonna get to that.

11
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:57,880
Let me wait to disappoint everybody.

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,179
Give me a few minutes to come and sit down.

13
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,829
Eating any olives today?

14
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,099
Uh, yeah, of course. I eat olives every day.

15
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,379
Talk about your Roblox server.

16
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:23,219
I don't have one of those.

17
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,219
Make me a cake.

18
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:30,260
That's the point. That's what we're gonna try to do today.

19
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,620
Don't, no, don't leak!

20
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,620
Don't leak.

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,620
People are already leaking the bad news for baseball.

22
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:46,659
Don't leak. Don't leak.

23
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:52,760
All right. Hey, no, it's not time yet.

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,280
I had a wild six or seven days.

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:05,140
Did the beerio cart thing with Ludwig, which was ton of fun.

26
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,139
I didn't think I could drink that many beers. I really didn't.

27
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,639
You guys didn't really get to see that much of the beer drinking, but holy shit.

28
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,330
I've never drank beer faster in my whole life.

29
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:23,580
We almost won, too.

30
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,300
When we got to Rainbow Road, it's just like, I can't do Rainbow Road.

31
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
I couldn't. I can't do Rainbow Road sober.

32
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,300
I can't do Rainbow Road at all.

33
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
I would skip that level.

34
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:45,210
In fact, I I would stop playing Mario Kart at that kind of what is it like the Star Cup, whatever?

35
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,210
No, I don't feel like it. I don't want to play that.

36
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:59,479
I don't want to play that part of the game, but that was fun.

37
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:03,479
Then this whole Mr. Beast versus Ninja Tournament.

38
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,560
That was crazy, too.

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,719
Got to hang out with a lot of people.

40
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,719
There's a lot of fun.

41
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,219
I wish I wish more people would come to Vegas.

42
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,650
It's so much fun when people come here.

43
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,060
Rainbow Road is easy.

44
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,139
What did you say?

45
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,590
I want to see this person said Rainbow Road is easy.

46
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,590
You just need skills.

47
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,569
No, it's not easy.

48
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:44,310
You lost 10,000 at 10K.

49
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,310
No, I did not.

50
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,330
I did not lose 10K at the casino.

51
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,680
Which Rainbow Road?

52
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,240
Aren't they all the same exact course from when it first showed up in Super Nintendo?

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,610
It's the same one, right?

54
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,319
Did they change it?

55
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,319
Why would they change it?

56
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,319
They don't even need to change it.

57
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,099
It was 20K.

58
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:19,000
Where are you getting this idea that I lost $20,000 at a casino?

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Who told you this?

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,279
It was 30K.

61
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,279
Well, the number keeps going up.

62
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,279
So whatever.

63
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,310
We know.

64
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,339
No, it was awesome.

65
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,339
It was really fun.

66
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:47,819
Anytime a bunch of streamers come into Vegas and I ever have an opportunity, I'm just like, oh, come to Vegas.

67
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:48,819
All right.

68
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:49,819
All right.

69
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:50,819
You'll be in Vegas.

70
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:51,819
Really?

71
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,129
What are you up to?

72
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,129
Hey, what are you doing?

73
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:07,060
It's always a lot of fun.

74
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,060
Why do you live in Vegas?

75
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,639
Because, you know what I mean?

76
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,069
That's it.

77
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:18,310
Okay, I'll do it slow this time.

78
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,310
Why do you live in Vegas?

79
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,310
Because.

80
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,379
Come on.

81
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,379
You know what I'm saying?

82
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,009
You know what I mean?

83
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:38,470
That's why.

84
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:44,100
Oh, it's close to LA, but you don't have to pay LA prices.

85
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,100
It's only 45 minutes in a plane to LA.

86
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:55,269
The real estate market out here is way, way cheaper than some of these other places.

87
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:59,269
There's no state tax in Nevada.

88
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,269
Isn't that interesting?

89
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:04,269
There's also lots of entertainment.

90
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:07,269
There's so much stuff to do here.

91
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,269
24.

92
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,269
Do you have to do this whole thing every few months?

93
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,790
Do I have to do this every few months?

94
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:28,750
Do you have a yak trick?

95
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,750
Taxes?

96
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,750
I didn't move here just because of the tax, the state taxes not being a thing.

97
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:42,129
I mean, it was, I mean, you know, all right, but that's not why I'm here.

98
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:49,500
Again, it's close to LA.

99
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,810
I don't have to pay LA prices.

100
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,980
45 minutes, wheels up, wheels down.

101
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,980
The real estate market is that I'm not doing this anymore.

102
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:10,149
What happened to the mystery game?

103
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,149
Every single stream is a mystery game.

104
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:16,350
I figured out what I'm going to do 10 minutes before the stream turns on.

105
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,350
Every day is a mystery.

106
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:26,980
Besides the event streams like baseball, by the way, talk about with baseball.

107
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
So I got enough people here.

108
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,980
Let's do it.

109
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,670
So baseball, baseball is supposed to be on the 24th of July.

110
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,670
I told you the last time I streamed, I kind of had it was kind of a sad moment.

111
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,670
I said, we're trying really hard to get stuff to work.

112
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,670
We've had some venue problems.

113
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:52,670
And I was given the opportunity to either do it in a different place that would kind of suck.

114
00:07:52,670 --> 00:08:00,230
It's not what I want or push it to August and do it where I want to do it and how I want to do it.

115
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:07,230
So I said, OK, this do you delay another few weeks, another month or so, right?

116
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:18,230
And do what I actually want to do or keep the same date and do it in a different venue, potentially in a scenario that I didn't want to do it in.

117
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:25,670
And of course, I'm going to pick the one that I want to do.

118
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,670
So we're going to do it in August.

119
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:39,299
Thankfully, it does not have to be in October or November or something.

120
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,299
So we're good.

121
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,299
And also, here's another good thing about this.

122
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:53,899
There is a couple of things that I may have wanted to do that I didn't have enough time to prepare for it if it was in a week that now I can I can add into the show.

123
00:08:53,899 --> 00:09:00,899
So it's going to be a better show now overall because there's a couple of things I get to put in it now that I may have had to cut for time.

124
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,240
So I hope I don't sound like a broken record here.

125
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,240
But August 19th is the new date for the baseball show.

126
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Now, I'm going to tell you right now, I am 90 percent confident in that day.

127
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,240
I don't think it's possible at this point for it to be not that day.

128
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,240
If it's not that day, then I'm doing it in my backyard.

129
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
You know what I mean?

130
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Like, I'll do it.

131
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
I'll do it in fucking in a backyard, right?

132
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,220
Only 90 percent.

133
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,220
This stream is going to happen before the summer ends.

134
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,220
OK, that's what I can 100 percent guarantee to you.

135
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:57,259
Delay, delay, delays, delays, delays, delays.

136
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,629
I know.

137
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,629
But here's the thing.

138
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:03,629
If I don't delay the show, think about it.

139
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:08,629
If the show were to be next week and it's I mean, look, it's going to be good.

140
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:10,629
I am so excited to do this.

141
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:13,000
I've been looking forward to this for like two years.

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's going to be fun, regardless of where it is or how the things that I want go.

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Right.

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But why not do the thing you wanted to do, the thing that you've been planning to do,

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
the thing that I've had written down on a piece of paper?

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, that makes it sound like it's on the back of a fucking napkin.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The thing that I have spent.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, I wrote down two sentences.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, the thing that I've had sitting in various documents over the last few years.

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,370
Shit that I really want to do and I'm going to do the thing I want to do.

151
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,370
And that's all there is to it.

152
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,230
20, 22, not 20. No, not 20, 23.

153
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,100
We're talking about our grotto beast NFTs.

154
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:06,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, stop.

155
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,340
Stop asking.

156
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,340
No, no, they're not.

157
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

158
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,139
Clip any of those.

159
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:17,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

160
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

161
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,240
Any one of those will do.

162
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:23,740
Clip any one of those.

163
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,240
They're physical.

164
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:37,460
Do we get two raids right at the beginning?

165
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,299
Wait one?

166
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,899
Kit Boga just came in with a raid.

167
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:42,600
What's up, Kit?

168
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,399

Fuck yeah.

187
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,059
I feel like it's been a month since I streamed.

188
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,860
It's only been a week.

189
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,970
But why am I streaming at 11 o'clock in the morning tomorrow?

190
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,149
There's a sponsor stream tomorrow.

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,139
Sponsored by water.

200
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,350
That's not going to be the only thing we do tomorrow.

201
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,230
We'll play another game or two as well.

202
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,830
But starting at 11 o'clock in the morning.

203
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:39,299
You should get sponsored by sick.

204
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:42,200
What people I don't know what it is recently the last month

205
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,600
or two.

206
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,259
I was what's the cigarette thing?

207
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,259
Is that the thing I'm missing somehow?

208
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:50,090
All right, let's go.

209
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,590
Today, we're going to play Bakery Simulator.

210
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,840
Bakery Simulator.

211
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,340
This feels is this made by the same people that did

212
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,009
cooking simulator?

213
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,519
It's the same people.

214
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,419
You're going to do a raid song that guys.

215
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,620
It's not 2018.

216
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,820
We don't do raid songs anymore.

217
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,799
Is it by the same people?

218
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,149
I think you can drive around from the trailer.

219
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,450
It looks like there's a car in this game.

220
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,950
So it gets an automatic a start today.

221
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,639
And let's go is ready.

222
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,919
Why is it asking me if I want my my Nintendo Switch one?

223
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,179
Okay.

224
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,149
Hi.

00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:02,899
You cam is blurry Ralph.

228
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:03,500
Oh, whatever.

229
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,299
All right.

230
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:05,399
So should I do the tutorial?

231
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,100
Should I figure out doing how to play this already?

232
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,519
I'm just gonna do it.

233
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,220
You're all orange.

234
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,690
Do you look like an orange?

235
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,090
I don't I don't care.

236
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,480
Everything is in PST.

237
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,879
That's right.

238
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,779
I'm in PST.

239
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,309
I also figured out to I don't know what it is about this

240
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:32,210
camera, but I looked at the images from the last stream

241
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,080
to this makes my head go like this.

242
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,570
It makes my forehead and head look way taller and bigger.

243
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,769
I don't know why it's doing that.

244
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,960
What lens does that?

245
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:46,210
Do you see what I mean?

246
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:49,509
I have this big forehead with this camera.

247
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
I don't look like this.

248
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,940
Oh, I was off the loading time.

249
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,340
All right.

250
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:58,309
Welcome to your bakery.

251
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,179
Your biggest dream came true.

252
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:02,379
You opened your very own bakery and you're ready to flood

253
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,580
the city with fresh pastries.

254
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,460
However, it's just the beginning a lot of hard work ahead

255
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,740
of you build reputation gain experience and become successful

256
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,840
in the world of baking.

257
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,700
There's a lot of responsibilities, but don't this is a guitar

258
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
is kind of I don't know something about it.

259
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:20,240
There's a lot of responsibilities, but don't worry.

260
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,539
You'll make it after all.

261
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:22,740
This is all you've dreamed of.

262
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,539
Your first order is waiting for you.

263
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,860
This is just bad Ratatouille.

264
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,259
You have not played it.

265
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:30,860
You don't know that.

266
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,639
Okay, WASD.

267
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,139
That's got to change for sure.

268
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,179
Is this a piano or is this a guitar?

269
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,049
Is it no way this is this is the guitar setting on the piano.

270
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,779
No, this inputs too high.

271
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,409
That's the lowest I can do.

272
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:00,809
Please tell me it's all right.

273
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:01,820
Right.

274
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,220
That's better.

275
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:02,720
All right.

276
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Go to the ordering board and press left mouse on the folder.

277
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,019
All right.

278
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:08,619
Ordering board left mouse folder.

279
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,119
There it is.

280
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,519
Got it.

281
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:15,720
Oh, five minute bakery three breakfast bun at the road.

282
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,410
Okay.

283
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,309
I don't know why I thought that was like three breakfast

284
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:23,099
bun road because I saw this whoops.

285
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,200
Okay, this is how you're going to start your work from now on.

286
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,740
Okay, so it's take it takes five minutes on the left is a

287
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,740
list of shops with current orders.

288
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,920
Now only one order is available.

289
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,619
Okay, but later in the game, you'll be able to pick more

290
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:43,420
than one request from a much longer list.

291
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:43,819
All right.

292
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,009
That's a map with marked shops based on it.

293
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:51,410
You can check the location of orders.

294
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,109
You can decide what part of the city you want to make a

295
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:53,609
delivery to.

296
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:53,910
All right.

297
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,410
So yeah, you drive around in this game.

298
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,640
Are you wearing a wig?

299
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:01,599
You'll make it up if I say no anyways.

300
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:04,519
All right, pick the available order and press confirm.

301
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:10,400
So this one here after selecting order will appear the ordering

302
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,900
board pressed on the board.

303
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,099
All right.

304
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:17,089
So this is the order three breakfast buns, but before you

305
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:23,539
move further, let me teach you about the recipe book to open

306
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,039
the okay press tab.

307
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,140
Is this by the house flipper people?

308
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,609
This menu looks very similar.

309
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:43,220
Okay, so where's the recipe book wig select the recipe book

310
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,380
now here are all the recipes that you already know right now.

311
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,880
It's not that much but don't worry with every new level.

312
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,880
You'll learn new ones bookmarks on the side make navigation

313
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,180
easier.

314
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,440
Where's my there is that's looks like a lot of information.

315
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,960
That's a lot of info.

316
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,859
That's a ton of steps.

317
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,150
Okay, this is gonna I don't want to this.

318
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,849
I don't want to do this.

319
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:09,509
Each recipe page contains information about the steps

320
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:12,410
required to prepare the order as well as ingredients mixing

321
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,309
time ingredients and baking time.

322
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:18,650
You can stop tracking it.

323
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,650
I was like a quest log.

324
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,980
All right, you should recreate this on stream.

325
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,069
No, I don't like the smell of eggs.

326
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:31,400
I like the way I like the way eggs taste.

327
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,299
I don't like the smell of raw eggs after you crack a raw egg

328
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,099
and if it just sits out there for more than more than one

329
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:38,900
to two minutes.

330
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,680
I hate that smell of raw egg.

331
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,779
That is not like gone away from me.

332
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,799
There's no eggs in this.

333
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,509
Do you guys know what I'm talking about though?

334
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:55,140
I don't like baking because it is a flower and eggs.

335
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,980
It has this weird off-putting kind of essence to it.

336
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,880
I really don't like it.

337
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,579
It's weird.

338
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,640
You know, some of you guys get it.

339
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:07,470
You don't smell the eggs.

340
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,170
No, you don't.

341
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,170
I'm not smelling them.

342
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,769
All right, I'm trying to play.

343
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:14,289
Okay, you can choose the number of products to bake by.

344
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:14,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

345
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,890
Okay, use the arrows.

346
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:17,930
The recipe will adjust accordingly.

347
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,430
Oh, okay.

348
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,470
Cool checklist is visible on the right.

349
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,970
So this is how to make the breakfast buns follow the recipe

350
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,609
and complete it perfectly cooking is not a science man.

351
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:35,329
Come on six ounces of wheat flour.

352
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,950
I could do five 2.4 fluid ounces of water.

353
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,880
You could do two milk.

354
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,480
Just don't even put it in because milk is gross yeast

355
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,380
extra yeast.

356
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,569
I want one ounce of yeast and then what?

357
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,900
By the way, don't do that you like milk and flour is incredibly

358
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,000
important in all these recipes.

359
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:56,900
So don't be an idiot.

360
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,180
All right, let's do some baking bowl.

361
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,339
This bowl is the average and small but don't worry during

362
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:06,640
the game.

363
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,740
You'll be able to unlock bigger and more professional bowls.

364
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:18,430
Okay, that's what I do in the kitchen.

365
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,460
I'm here for like I'm like the comic relief.

366
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:24,910
All right, so now what oh time to collect the needed ingredients

367
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,710
go to the ingredients rack.

368
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,210
Let's go.

369
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,809
So I need wheat flour something on fire.

370
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,089
Oh, I don't like that.

371
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Is that what it is?

372
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
I feel like that's dangerous.

373
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,059
What if you walk by and you like get your your pant leg catches

374
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:39,759
on fire.

375
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,700
This is not controlled enough for me.

376
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:45,220
All right, ingredients rack.

377
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:52,240
Where's that over here in the bottom left corner of the screen?

378
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,220
You can find the scoops for now.

379
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,319
You just need to a one gram scoop.

380
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:05,710
Click the ingredients by clicking with my scoop bottom left

381
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,410
of the screen.

382
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:14,430
You guys see any scoops every time you're using the scoop or

383
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,150
pressing and holding left mouse the spoon will refill itself

384
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,650
one by one.

385
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:18,950
All right.

386
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,319
So how much do I need?

387
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,559
This is this is butter pure creamy butter.

388
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,960
Is this even in the recipe?

389
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:29,849
What do I need?

390
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
Where's my scoops?

391
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,609
Pick up the bowl.

392
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:43,369
Oh, that looks to be about one cup.

393
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,160
Let it go and a quarter of it is stuck to my sweaty hand.

394
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,490
I just have to like shake like this.

395
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:52,259
All right.

396
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:54,940
So now we go water.

397
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,089
No wheat flour.

398
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:57,589
Where's that?

399
00:22:58,799 --> 00:22:59,500
Where's a flour?

400
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:09,990
Okay, wheat flour scoop it out.

401
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,730
There's no butter in this recipe.

402
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,849
Do you see butter?

403
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:24,160
What there's no butter in this recipe.

404
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,140
Okay.

405
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:28,640
Oopsie.

406
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,440
Look at the checklist.

407
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,740
Seems you've added the wrong ingredient.

408
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,539
What will you do now?

409
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:32,839
This is what I've just was saying the whole time.

410
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,539
What are you talking about?

411
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,140
What do I do now?

412
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,210
By the way, anytime you make a mistake, you will see the

413
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:40,309
exclamation point icon.

414
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,440
Okay, don't worry.

415
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,740
This mistake can be fixed easily.

416
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,339
Why is it all over me?

417
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,140
It's literally all over me.

418
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:55,430
You can remove only the last ingredient by pointing on the

419
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,529
ingredient container.

420
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,960
Oh, that's actually pretty helpful.

421
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,059
Okay, right click.

422
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:05,920
It's still in there.

423
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,019
It's still in the bowl.

424
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:11,859
This is...

425
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,759
Did I sneeze into this bowl?

426
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,160
Why is it like this?

427
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:18,160
Did I put a bunch of ingredients in here just like...

428
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:19,839
All right.

429
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,240
What...

430
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,039
What...

431
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,240
There's still butter in here.

432
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
In the bowl, you can move them by using like a...

433
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,500
Wait, hold on.

434
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,000
I gotta read this slowly.

435
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:31,809
Cool.

436
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,009
But what to do when more than one ingredient in the bowl is

437
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:35,509
wrong?

438
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,190
Throw them in the trash.

439
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:38,990
Okay.

440
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,289
Okay.

441
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,390
Now move to the trash.

442
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,200
Who puts butter in a bowl like this?

443
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,170
Guys.

444
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:56,670
Fucking children don't even do it like that.

445
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,140
This was sprayed out of a jokey clown seltzer bottle.

446
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,420
Children don't do this.

447
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:07,460
Okay.

448
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:08,859
Where's the trash?

449
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,910
Where's the trash?

450
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:16,609
Is there a trash...

451
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:17,210
Oh, okay.

452
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:21,359
It's still in there.

453
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,759
Okay, with this message you get rid of the entire content

454
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,359
of the bowl.

455
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
You can also use the trash to throw away other things.

456
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,230
I don't fucking look like this.

457
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:43,930
I swear to God.

458
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,029
I don't look like this.

459
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,250
I swear to God.

460
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,750
I don't look like this image.

461
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,349
I truly don't.

462
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:33,890
Fucking pepperoni forehead.

463
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,490
Guys, I don't look like...

464
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,089
I'm unplugging this camera.

465
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:38,789
This camera is fucking messed up.

466
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,279
You have a massive...

467
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:43,980
No, I don't...

468
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,079
There's pictures of me.

469
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,779
There are pictures of me on the internet.

470
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,980
I don't look like this.

471
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,180
There are pictures of me on the internet.

472
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,079
I don't look like this.

473
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,150
My face has been like stretched 50% this way.

474
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,150
I don't look like this.

475
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,339
What?

476
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,359
No, that's okay.

477
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:12,759
I was gonna...

478
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,460
No, I was gonna say there's no fucking way.

479
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,519
No, these are all...

480
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,819
Okay, you guys are fucking with all these.

481
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,500
I look like if they ever remade Frankenstein, right?

482
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,900
This would be...

483
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,200
This is like a new age Frankenstein.

484
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,059
This is like Frankenstein in high school or something, right?

485
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,670
This would be like the Christopher Nolan Frankenstein.

486
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,200
Frankenstein's monster.

487
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,599
Frankenstein...

488
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,400
Yeah, whatever.

489
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:53,869
You don't care.

490
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:01,910
All right.

491
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,309
Let's go back to what we were doing, please.

492
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:10,960
Yeah, I don't know.

493
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,660
Some cameras just fucked up.

494
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,839
What were we doing?

495
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:15,240
Oh, yeah.

496
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,839
All right, right, right.

497
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,140
Okay.

498
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,779
Use the trash bin to throw away...

499
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,680
People playing tic-tac-toe on my forehead.

500
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:28,220
That's fine.

501
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,650
10 times smarter than everybody in this room.

502
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,410
You know what fits right here?

503
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,210
Hey, what's the part of your brain?

504
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:36,509
What?

505
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:36,809
Okay.

506
00:28:37,109 --> 00:28:37,710
What's the part of your...

507
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,410
I don't give a shit.

508
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,410
We're gonna pause for a minute.

509
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,349
This part where your forehead is right here.

510
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:43,650
What's in there?

511
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:45,150
Your frontal cortex, right?

512
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:46,349
That's hearing.

513
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,150
That's math.

514
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,849
That's knowledge.

515
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,250
That's baking, right?

516
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:50,250
That's everything.

517
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:51,150
What's in there?

518
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:51,950
Hearing.

519
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,289
What's in your frontal lobe?

520
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:53,789
What is it?

521
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,589
Useless shit.

522
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,079
What's right?

523
00:28:59,079 --> 00:28:59,680
What is...

524
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,880
What goes right here?

525
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,109
Hearing is the only thing.

526
00:29:06,069 --> 00:29:07,569
It's personality and shit.

527
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:09,339
Come on, man.

528
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,450
That's where the funny noises come from.

529
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,799
It's my brain.

530
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,589
My brain probably looks...

531
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:24,890
It's probably just this big mass in the front and then it's just squished down and flat in the middle and down at the end.

532
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,940
It's your whole personality.

533
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,779
All right, let's go.

534
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,099
All right, you can throw anything away.

535
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:40,599
Who cares?

536
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,799
Let's get back to baking.

537
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,670
Look at the ingredients rack.

538
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,769
It seems that one of the ingredients you need is missing.

539
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:47,470
Don't worry.

540
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:50,069
This is where all the baking supplies tab in the radial menu comes from.

541
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,170
All right, so put this down.

542
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,289
Put the bowl down.

543
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,240
All right, so let's do the radial menu.

544
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,640
It's like baking supplies.

545
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,799
This is...

546
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,099
I thought this was a chess board.

547
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,109
The baking supplies tab is where you can buy missing ingredients.

548
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,059
Okay, choose the missing product.

549
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:11,759
I need wheat.

550
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,579
Okay.

551
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:18,589
Purchased products don't immediately arrive to your bakery.

552
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,589
Usually you have to wait for the delivery to get to them.

553
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:22,390
This can be a little troublesome.

554
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:22,990
Yeah.

555
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,289
However, you can speed up the delivery.

556
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:25,990
Be careful.

557
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,789
It may cost you.

558
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,420
Press U on wheat flour.

559
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,599
Oh, okay.

560
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,259
Do I have to use gems for this?

561
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,579
Thank God.

562
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,279
This one simple trick, which will help you avoid paying for a faster delivery or

563
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,079
waiting for ingredients to arrive.

564
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,279
Just buy all the missing products before choosing an order.

565
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,279
Being prepared for the day will save you some money.

566
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:56,980
Good.

567
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:58,690
Good.

568
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:59,089
Okay.

569
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,299
Well, now what?

570
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,200
It's time to start and leave for...

571
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,000
What's wrong with me?

572
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,700
What happened?

573
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,859
Am I donating blood right now?

574
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,700
What's going on?

575
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,279
What's going on here?

576
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:16,670
Okay.

577
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:21,539
You can collect the ingredients every time you use the scoop.

578
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,769
All right.

579
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:23,869
The edibles are not kicking in.

580
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:24,670
I haven't taken one.

581
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:30,769
I think somebody's just playing music in my ears.

582
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:31,470
This is why I don't listen.

583
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,740
Do you have your voice playing on a delay?

584
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,039
No.

585
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:35,990
What blood type am I?

586
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,789
I have no idea.

587
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,299
You know, that's actually kind of hard to figure out if you don't already know it.

588
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,849
You have to specifically request that they do that.

589
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,160
If you get blood taken and you ask, hey, so what's my blood type?

590
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,460
They'll go.

591
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,960
I don't know.

592
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,339
They have to actually go look for that.

593
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:54,740
You can't...

594
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,640
They won't just tell you.

595
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,740
How big is the wingspan that you have?

596
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:02,339
I don't know.

597
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,039
15 feet.

598
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:06,349
Maybe 16 feet.

599
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,079
All right.

600
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,279
You can collect the ingredient by clicking.

601
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:11,480
Yes.

602
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:11,680
All right.

603
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,180
So let's go.

604
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:13,079
What do I need?

605
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:16,470
Into the bowl.

606
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:18,170
There's still butter in this bowl.

607
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,769
Can I rinse it?

608
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:20,170
Whatever.

609
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:20,670
I don't care.

610
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:21,890
All right.

611
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,490
We need...

612
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,490
I want ounces.

613
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,059
So wheat flour.

614
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,059
Can I just...

615
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:29,259
Yeah, use a big spoon.

616
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:29,559
What the hell?

617
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:30,460
What am I doing this for?

618
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,019
Just use it.

619
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,390
Just get a shovel.

620
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:36,619
All right.

621
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:37,819
Four ounces of flour.

622
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:38,720
Get it in there.

623
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,549
And then two ounces of flour.

624
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:41,049
Get it in there.

625
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,170
All right.

626
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,670
We have six ounces of flour in this bowl.

627
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,539
We need yeast.

628
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:48,839
2.24 ounces of yeast.

629
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
So this is that.

630
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,019
And then 0.2.

631
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,390
Got it.

632
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,390
0.24.

633
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:57,670
We need milk.

634
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:01,769
Full fat milk.

635
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:02,170
Yuck.

636
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:03,700
2.4.

637
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:04,299
All right.

638
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:04,799
Do that again.

639
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:11,509
We're going to do 2.4.

640
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,440
Bingo.

641
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:16,769
We need water.

642
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:17,990
Okay.

643
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,190
Water.

644
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,089
2.4 water.

645
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:22,109
Good.

646
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:22,710
Sugar.

647
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,380
Okay.

648
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,680
0.12 ounces.

649
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,720
Okay.

650
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:33,920
Good job.

651
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,220
Now you can mix the ingredients.

652
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:36,519
Where?

653
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,119
Transfer the dough to the mixer by pressing...

654
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:40,519
Oh, okay.

655
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:40,819
Here we go.

656
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:43,210
Press...

657
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:43,910
Did I do it?

658
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:44,309
All right.

659
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:44,910
Everything's in there.

660
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,210
Press the button on the mixer casing and wait for the dough to be ready.

661
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,210
Watch the widget carefully.

662
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,410
You don't over mix the batter.

663
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,079
Upgrade the machine.

664
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,650
It's almost done.

665
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:05,839
Check.

666
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:06,839
No, it's almost done.

667
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,940
It's going to over mix.

668
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,059
I can't wait seven seconds for this.

669
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:17,559
Okay.

670
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,860
So turbo mode.

671
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,159
I thought you don't want to mix things quickly.

672
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,360
Sometimes that you needed to do.

673
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,460
You don't want to be that...

674
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,460
All right.

675
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,159
Be careful.

676
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,659
How do I do a turbo mode?

677
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,099
Hey, hey.

678
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,599
Turn it off.

679
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:37,900
Turn it off.

680
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,199
Turn it off.

681
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:38,699
Turn it off.

682
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:41,369
Okay.

683
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,449
Take the bowl back.

684
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,849
Put the dough on the forming board.

685
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,530
What's up?

686
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,530
Is this a forming board?

687
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,510
Buns are formed with bare hands.

688
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,909
Put down the bowl in the table and in the middle of the bakery.

689
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:57,500
Okay.

690
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,500
With my bare hands?

691
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:05,400
There are various forms of pastries from longbread to...

692
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:06,739
croissant.

693
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,639
As you gain more and more experience, you will learn how to create different forms.

694
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,239
But for now, let's just do a bun.

695
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,840
Okay.

696
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:15,920
It's like buns.

697
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,940
Dividing dough is the first minigame.

698
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,639
Wait for the indicator to reach the green area.

699
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:24,340
Press space.

700
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:25,639
That was fucking perfect.

701
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,539
Literally right in the middle.

702
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:27,539
Exactly 50%.

703
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,719
Okay.

704
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:35,219
Form the dough is the second minigame.

705
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:38,619
Grab the ring and move the mouse to match the images with their shadows.

706
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,619
What?

707
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:48,489
Grab the ring and move the images with their shadows.

708
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
Form the buns.

709
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,760
What?

710
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:58,389
Oh.

711
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,400
Now put the freshly formed buns on the tray.

712
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,190
I keep thinking the restaurant is on fire.

713
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:21,190
It keeps freaking me out.

714
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,030
Okay.

715
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,329
Do this.

716
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:28,329
Grab and hold the tray.

717
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:36,239
Put it down.

718
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,789
Oh, grab.

719
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:39,989
Okay.

720
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,889
Wait, I can do it from the tray.

721
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:41,289
I get it.

722
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:45,409
Okay.

723
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,269
Bake your buns.

724
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:49,170
However, you have just an old oven for now.

725
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:49,570
Don't worry.

726
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,969
You'll acquire better ovens later.

727
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Open the oven door.

728
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,750
This is so scary.

729
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,550
I don't know how we will come to determine that.

730
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,449
This is just a normal thing to have just in people's houses and shit.

731
00:37:04,449 --> 00:37:05,550
I'm serious.

732
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:09,039
Okay.

733
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,929
There's no timer on this oven.

734
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:20,159
I thought you're not supposed to open it.

735
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,960
Boost.

736
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:33,710
What is this doing?

737
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,710
Holy shit.

738
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,309
Is that okay?

739
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,309
My hands.

740
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,360
Why is there a boost button?

741
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:45,340
Find the delivery crate next to the door.

742
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,980
The amount of delivery creates is always determined by the number of orders you

743
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,780
picked up in the current day.

744
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,079
All right.

745
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:53,980
So this is delivery crate.

746
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,579
Is he live?

747
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:01,079
Yeah.

748
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:01,920
What do you mean?

749
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,619
Is this live?

750
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:02,920
Yeah.

751
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:03,619
What are you talking about?

752
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,320
How does that not delivery crates?

753
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:14,849
Where's the delivery crate?

754
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:20,860
Oh, I guess the tutorial blocks me out.

755
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,480
Okay.

756
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,980
Each delivery crate has the client's logo on the side to help you identify the

757
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,579
correct crate.

758
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,980
This one is going to be delivered in two.

759
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,880
I thought it's to be delivered in five minutes.

760
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:34,769
Okay.

761
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,239
Okay.

762
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,599
Where's the delivery crate?

763
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,599
Is it the crates by the door?

764
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:57,019
Is this a crate?

765
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,539
Which one of these is closer to the door?

766
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,619
The crates by the door.

767
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,519
Oh, yeah, just go to the crates by the door.

768
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
That's not by the door.

769
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,659
That's by the oven.

770
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:16,329
Okay.

771
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,199
Put the tray back on the counter.

772
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,000
Now last step time to prepare the buns for delivery.

773
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,820
Pick up the crate and place it in the orange highlight in the blue area.

774
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,940
Crate will then be moved to the delivery car.

775
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:28,739
Ooh.

776
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:31,440
Remember that later in the game you'll be able to stack crates on top of each

777
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,940
other to deliver multiple orders.

778
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:35,039
Now the order is ready for delivery.

779
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,539
Move to the door and press to do it.

780
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,940
Let's deliver the food.

781
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,630
Here you can choose which order you want to deliver.

782
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,429
You've got only one order available.

783
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:46,730
So we're already picked it for you.

784
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,530
Press the move to city button.

785
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,429
This is one man operation.

786
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:03,670
This is not the end of your task.

787
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,170
Delivering the orders is as important as preparing them.

788
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:10,769
During this part of your job, you have to be as fast as possible.

789
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:13,670
Remember to watch the timer in the top of the screen.

790
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,670
This is crazy taxi with buns.

791
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,880
Later in the game, you'll be able to hire a courier to deliver the orders for you.

792
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,019
In the bottom left corner, you can see a mini map that will help you

793
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:28,320
navigate through the city streets.

794
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,019
To check the whole view of the area.

795
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:31,519
You can open the city map.

796
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,619
I didn't do anything.

797
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:33,420
I'm already in trouble.

798
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,920
Open the radial menu.

799
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,159
Call for a delay.

800
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,400
Okay.

801
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:46,030
Reset position decline.

802
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,630
Oh, I can just cancel the order.

803
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:52,690
How come your ears are twitching?

804
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:58,739
Okay.

805
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,239
WASD.

806
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:02,670
Spacebar.

807
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,869
Why is this original GTA?

808
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,389
Where am I going?

809
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:10,989
Oh, right here.

810
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,460
Shit, this guy's on.

811
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,750
That was 30 minutes or less.

812
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:28,750
Deliver.

813
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:40,889
What happens if you crash?

814
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:41,289
I don't know.

815
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:42,590
I don't want to fail the tutorial.

816
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
What the fuck did I just do?

817
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:49,590
All right.

818
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,090
Time to take a little break from baking.

819
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:52,989
You know, what's always fun?

820
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,090
Makeovers.

821
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:56,989
It's time for the bakery to get a renovation.

822
00:41:57,989 --> 00:41:58,190
Okay.

823
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,289
Customization tab.

824
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,559
Point at the main table and press the...

825
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,739
Okay.

826
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,559
Tables.

827
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:13,190
Is this not the main table?

828
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,400
Is this wrong?

829
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,610
It's time for you to do a makeover scene.

830
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,230
Which one of these is the main table?

831
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,710
This, this is a main table.

832
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,320
Should I just bought that?

833
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:38,289
You just completed your first order.

834
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,389
Don't forget what you've learned.

835
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:41,389
It will be useful in your further experience as a baker.

836
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:41,989
Good luck.

837
00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:43,190
Oh shit.

838
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:50,960
Nice.

839
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,579
All right, let's go.

840
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,079
I got, I got a million dollars.

841
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,880
I forget everything.

842
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,780
All right, over here.

843
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:03,809
Do you want to check orders and start a new day?

844
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:04,610
Wait, not yet.

845
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,309
I got to get ready.

846
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,349
Am I ready?

847
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,380
Am I ready?

848
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:17,380
Yeah.

849
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:17,780
All right.

850
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,980
I just want to make sure I have everything.

851
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:20,739
All right, let's go.

852
00:43:26,989 --> 00:43:27,289
Okay.

853
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:28,389
I thought I could just drive around.

854
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,329
All right, let's do it.

855
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,030
New, it's time for a new day.

856
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:33,829
We need one bronze bed.

857
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:35,230
Bronze bread.

858
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,400
Here we go.

859
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,800
All right, one bronze.

860
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,000
I got eight minutes to do this.

861
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,400
Okay.

862
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,199
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

863
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:43,199
Get, close the map.

864
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,000
Get the fucking map.

865
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,599
I don't want to leave the restaurant.

866
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:46,699
Stay.

867
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,840
Okay, get off.

868
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,119
Oh, that's what I'm looking at.

869
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:51,619
All right, let's go.

870
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:52,119
Go, go, go, go.

871
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:52,619
What do I need?

872
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:53,719
Where's the recipe?

873
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,579
Recipe book.

874
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,119
All right, just track this.

875
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:01,420
Whatever.

876
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:01,820
I don't care.

877
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:03,550
How do I track that?

878
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:04,150
Track it.

879
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,289
Track this.

880
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:06,889
I need one.

881
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:07,289
Track it.

882
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:07,789
Okay, let's go.

883
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:09,829
Bowl.

884
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:12,639
Rye flour.

885
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:14,269
How much do I need?

886
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:15,769
1.2 pounds.

887
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:16,570
That's a lot.

888
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,320
Pounds?

889
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,210
That's a shitload of flour.

890
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:25,739
Okay, 12 ounces of water.

891
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:27,619
How much is a pound?

892
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:29,420
How much is a pound of water?

893
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,599
Oh, wait, hold on.

894
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,300
Hey, 12.

895
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,519
What is a pound of water?

896
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,320
Two fluid ounces of olive oil.

897
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:42,050
Okay.

898
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,159
Any milk in this?

899
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:45,869
0.2 of yeast.

900
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,619
What happened?

901
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,579
What happened?

902
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,480
I can't put any more stuff in here.

903
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:01,219
Yeast, 0.2 ounces of yeast.

904
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:02,519
Good.

905
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:04,019
Okay, salt, 0.2 of salt.

906
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:06,420
Oh, that's sea salt.

907
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,519
0.08 of sugar.

908
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:10,190
Okay.

909
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,289
How's that wrong?

910
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:13,150
How do I put the sugar back?

911
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:15,630
Okay, we're good.

912
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,849
Now we need to do 30 to 50 seconds in the machine.

913
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:22,019
Go.

914
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,800
Why does it sound like an old car?

915
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,570
All right, then we have to form it.

916
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:49,670
Okay, form it.

917
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:54,219
All right, put this down.

918
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:55,119
Go.

919
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:57,250
What is it called?

920
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:00,980
Bronze, bronze bread.

921
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:02,489
What is this?

922
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,760
No, no, no, that's not right.

923
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,159
That's not right.

924
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:06,460
That's wrong.

925
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:06,760
That's wrong.

926
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,360
How do I do this?

927
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:10,340
Is that correct?

928
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:12,210
Is it, is it round bread?

929
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,150
Is it brown, bronze bread?

930
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:15,750
Oh shit.

931
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,150
Oops.

932
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:25,539
Just one?

933
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,059
What fucking weird person ordered one of these?

934
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:32,659
All right, go.

935
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:33,260
Turbo.

936
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:41,190
What?

937
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:45,179
300, how many, can I tell the degrees of the oven?

938
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,440
Me?

939
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:04,150
Come on.

940
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,230
I only have five minutes to do this.

941
00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:14,449
Steam powered Andy.

942
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:19,670
Holy shit.

943
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,269
Oh my God, that actually looks pretty good.

944
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,800
That looks really good.

945
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:37,329
Guys, the floor is cleaner than my hands.

946
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:37,829
Okay.

947
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:39,340
Sir, trust me.

948
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:43,570
So now where's this going?

949
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,639
Do I, did I order it myself?

950
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:57,869
No, wait, what?

951
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:02,630
Am I cooking the books and making fake business for myself?

952
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,230
What am I doing?

953
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:10,000
Can I get a better camera angle with the car?

954
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:15,780
Why are there roadblocks?

955
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:20,510
Wait, AM.

956
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:32,239
No, that's good.

957
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,039
All right, deliver.

958
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:34,960
Right on time.

959
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:38,869
Did I just make six?

960
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:39,269
That's it.

961
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,300
I'm saying that's it.

962
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,599
$60 for one piece of bread seems a little absurd.

963
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,199
All right, cool.

964
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,000
I got 1060.

965
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:01,210
Wait, should I clean up?

966
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,300
No wonder it's like 80 degrees and 90 degrees in here.

967
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,199
Do I have to clean up or is it just, that's it?

968
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:17,670
Okay, two golden bread.

969
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:18,670
You got it?

970
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:21,969
I think I'm actually, I'm pretty good at this.

971
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:25,210
Recipe book.

972
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,800
Golden bread.

973
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:30,840
Two.

974
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,739
Oh, wait a minute.

975
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:32,840
I have to make two of these now.

976
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,340
All right, two track two.

977
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,139
That's very helpful.

978
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,539
Two and a half pounds of flour.

979
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:38,039
Let's get it.

980
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,579
1.2.

981
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,880
What is it wheat flour?

982
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,940
All right, two and a half pounds, one pint of water.

983
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:53,469
Is that one, how much is a pint?

984
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:57,880
Is 1.25 pounds of pint?

985
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:00,019
No.

986
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,219
How much is a pint?

987
00:50:04,829 --> 00:50:05,429
What's a pint?

988
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,210
Why would I be scooping this up with one of these scoopers?

989
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,900
I need one pint of water.

990
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,400
What is one pint of water?

991
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,000
How many ounces is a pint?

992
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:22,489
No, don't speak in milliliters.

993
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:23,889
I'm American.

994
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:26,599
16 ounces is a pint.

995
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,099
Okay.

996
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:31,559
Thank you.

997
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:33,159
Eight ounces of milk.

998
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:35,300
Eight ounces of salt.

999
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:42,860
Oh no, eight ounces of 0.56 of salt.

1000
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:49,460
That's 0.04.

1001
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:53,059
0.56.

1002
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:53,760
Okay.

1003
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:55,500
0.4 sugar.

1004
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,710
I got 20 minutes to do this.

1005
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:59,210
I'm fine.

1006
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,280
Wait one.

1007
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:04,380
Oh, we're good.

1008
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:06,480
All right, 0.48 of yeast.

1009
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:10,530
Okay.

1010
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,730
All right, 30 seconds in here.

1011
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,670
Do the other bread while you wait.

1012
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:40,909
There's no order for it.

1013
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,099
Oh wait, I'm doing this for too long, aren't I?

1014
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,099
All right, we're good.

1015
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:48,070
All right.

1016
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,269
This is golden bread.

1017
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:56,820
What kind of bread is this?

1018
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:58,929
Is this too much air in this?

1019
00:51:58,929 --> 00:51:59,429
What kind of bread is it?

1020
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:00,429
Is this a round bread?

1021
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:02,309
Or is this a, what kind of bread is it?

1022
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:06,469
It's a long bread?

1023
00:52:06,469 --> 00:52:06,869
Okay.

1024
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,880
Go!

1025
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,480
Okay.

1026
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,050
I feel like this is a captcha.

1027
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:41,309
Oh, you're better than 95% of all other players.

1028
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,619
Which by the way, I don't know how long it's taking some people to do that shit.

1029
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:53,420
But even if you do it wicked slow and you're deliberately trying to make it so you're doing it as slow as possible,

1030
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,019
you still apparently have done that faster than like 65% of the population.

1031
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:01,909
I don't, how?

1032
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:13,239
You can't let this get light on fire, right?

1033
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,429
I can't wait to open this and be like...

1034
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:38,949
Let's go.

1035
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:50,449
Ooh, any more orders?

1036
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:51,449
No, that's it.

1037
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:52,750
All right, let's go.

1038
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:55,480
Why are you so red?

1039
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:57,079
I'm filled with blood.

1040
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:07,699
All right.

1041
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:09,000
Can I get a better view of this car?

1042
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:12,670
There's got to be like a better like car view, right?

1043
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,269
I don't want this like GTA camera.

1044
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:20,219
Is there a better view?

1045
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:21,880
Inputs.

1046
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:34,159
Okay, character movement, character actions, minigames, cut dough, car movement, change truck camera, V.

1047
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:34,960
Okay, hold on.

1048
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:37,010
That doesn't work.

1049
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,460
C.

1050
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:50,760
I just drove by it.

1051
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,130
I can't see the little things in front of me.

1052
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:21,699
Okay.

1053
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:23,000
I'm starting to get the hang of it.

1054
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I think the game is going to start to get a little more difficult now.

1055
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,059
All right.

1056
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,460
Two old-fashioned loaves and three golden breads.

1057
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:33,960
This is going across town.

1058
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:39,920
Okay, I got 20 minutes.

1059
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,320
Let's go.

1060
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:41,219
All right.

1061
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:41,820
Three...

1062
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:42,320
Wait.

1063
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:45,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1064
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,079
No, wrong, wrong.

1065
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:50,380
Is it?

1066
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,579
Okay, three golden breads.

1067
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:51,980
No, it's...

1068
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,380
Okay, I was making sure it was tracking three.

1069
00:55:56,539 --> 00:55:57,039
All right.

1070
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,739
Wheat flour, three points pounds.

1071
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,420
Water, 1.5 pounds.

1072
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:13,570
Okay, milk, 12 ounces of milk.

1073
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:31,730
0.84 ounces of salt. Okay. Sugar. It's all right. Let's do it again. It's all right. We're good.

1074
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:41,099
All right. 0.72 of yeast. Good. I'm gonna try it. I'm gonna get the other stuff going too. All

1075
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:52,110
right. Get that started. Let's do the other one. Can I not make the other one? How do I make the

1076
00:56:52,110 --> 00:57:02,849
other one? Can I only do one at a time? Do I not have the capability to do more than one right now?

1077
00:57:10,849 --> 00:57:25,900
Cheese. What? Where? Get it. All right. Three golden breads. All right. Let's make this quick.

1078
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:37,980
That's not three. There's only two. Why is it only two?

1079
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:14,739
Fucking move. Move. All right. Get it. 20 minutes. Okay. Can I start another one?

1080
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:19,380
You're smart. You just don't know object permanence. I mean, I know object permanence,

1081
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:25,460
but not really. It just, it doesn't stay there. Okay. Things like, well, if I put something down,

1082
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,969
it's hard to remember where I put it, which is object permanence.

1083
00:58:29,969 --> 00:58:34,400
Fuck it. I could dodge an axe if you swing it at me. I don't give a shit.

1084
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:58,210
All right. So now what? I have 20 minutes to do this. Oh, those look good. All right. They're

1085
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:13,090
not ready yet. Now we're going to do the other one. Okay. So this one's ready. Oh shit. I have to come

1086
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:19,579
back and do it. Why would I do that? This, this oven can fit 10 pizzas in it. Why would I

1087
00:59:19,579 --> 00:59:25,090
not do all these deliveries at the same time? Why am I, why am I doing only three pieces of bread

1088
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:39,920
at once? What a waste of energy. Can I, where's my buy tool? Whatever. Let's go. I just keep,

1089
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:46,909
I don't know why I keep thinking about this. Oh dude. What's the baseball stream? Oh, he's

1090
00:59:46,909 --> 00:59:53,739
going to shove a whole baseball up his ass. Like at that person that asked the question.

1091
00:59:55,539 --> 00:59:58,260
You know how many times I keep, how many times I've thought about that comment?

1092
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:13,760
Do I even know what this is? I think I just lost the tire. Oh yeah, guys. Sorry. I got a delay.

1093
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,159
Oh, there's tons of preparation I got to do. Oh, what are you doing? Oh, why he's shoving

1094
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:43,380
a baseball up his ass. How do I even get over this other road? I don't want to drive like this.

1095
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:51,179
Why can I not be at third person angle? What is this? Where's this bridge? Oh,

1096
01:00:51,820 --> 01:01:23,489
can I get a faster car eventually? Holy shit. That was cool. Are the cops after me? I'm still

1097
01:01:23,489 --> 01:01:54,210
unsure what's going on with that. Yep. This is a far away delivery. Is this the last possible

1098
01:01:54,210 --> 01:02:06,929
place to deliver that's on the edge of the whole entire world here? This is the last

1099
01:02:06,929 --> 01:02:20,000
possible place to take this. Donut dude. All right. Donut dude. What do I got? 150 bucks?

1100
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:28,289
All right, let's go. My stomach hurts. Um, step on a little bit of ginger ale. Just a little.

1101
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:39,170
Very small sips. I have to do a new day. That's okay. Come on, man. All right. This one's right

1102
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:42,449
down the street and it pays the same amount of money. Why would I ever do the other one?

1103
01:02:46,929 --> 01:03:09,039
Wait, can I, how do I upgrade? I don't know. 600 bucks for what? I just changed the finish of the

1104
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:19,300
wood. Oh, it's everywhere. Okay. I actually prefer the other one. All right, let's get started. Come

1105
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:39,730
on. Uh, it was bronze bread, right? How many? Three bronze breads, 3.75 pounds of rye flour,

1106
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:53,789
2.5 pints. So that's din, din, din, din, din. No, din. Olive oil, six ounces of olive oil.

1107
01:03:53,789 --> 01:04:02,030
Is it actually olive oil? I guess that would be, yeah. All right. 0.6 of yeast. What happened?

1108
01:04:05,469 --> 01:04:18,989
Okay. That thing would have came alive. Salt, sugar.

1109
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:38,769
What the fuck is this? Who delivered the Willy Wonka candy machine?

1110
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:54,340
When the, what is this thing? All right. Free bronze bread. I can't say it. Excuse me. What's

1111
01:04:54,340 --> 01:05:18,639
happening here? What happened? Fucking go. Was this brown bread? Yeah. Toy boat check. Okay.

1112
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:26,769
That's right. Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,

1113
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:48,349
toy boat, toy boat. Oh, it's close. I got it. Pretty close. That's the wrong way. This game's

1114
01:05:48,349 --> 01:06:13,900
pretty chill. Oh, Undertale. Where'd it go? What happened? Oh, it's over there. The music.

1115
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:38,860
It sounded like Undertale. Do I have to come on? Come on. I'm not fighting you on this one.

1116
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:59,869
Okay. It's not even close. Come on. That's like the dog theme, right? I'm kidding. Holy smokes.

1117
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:09,570
Look at this. Don't you feel like that you would take this piece of bread and you would go like,

1118
01:07:14,179 --> 01:07:26,639
it would make you, you would be like, you can't bite it. And you just put it down. And then

1119
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:29,840
somebody would come over with a big ass knife and it would be like,

1120
01:07:29,840 --> 01:08:01,699
I like the middle. Everyone out here trying to be the next ball fondler. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, man.

1121
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:11,150
You're just going to get timed out for, you know what I mean? People out here trying to, you know,

1122
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:25,949
follow that trend of what ball fondler said, man, there, by the way, mods, why that comment is

1123
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:42,399
strange because there is no turkey baster. There's no, there's nothing here. This is not a

1124
01:08:42,399 --> 01:09:03,729
turkey baster. Where? Show me the turkey baster. Okay. Three silver loaf or four golden bread.

1125
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:11,489
This one, because it's right down the street and it's 200 bucks. What's, what is he talking about?

1126
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:21,970
I'm talking about the crazy things that people say in this chat. All right. So what are, what

1127
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:29,020
are we doing here? How many, what do I need? Four, right? Four. So can I pull it up? All right.

1128
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:34,579
Recipe book. Let's go. All right. Four puppet bread. What the hell is that?

1129
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:49,390
What was it? Bronze bread? I don't remember. What is it? Go for golden bread. Okay. Let's go.

1130
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:54,130
All right. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, five pounds of wheat

1131
01:09:54,130 --> 01:10:12,340
flour, whole meal flour. What? What's wrong? What is it empty? How do I buy more? Oh, it's empty. How

1132
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:29,039
do I buy more? 20. Deliver it now. How much did that cost me? Is that too much? I don't care.

1133
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,729
How much is in here? Five. Yeah, we're good. All right. Two pints of water.

1134
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:40,800
One pint of milk. This is almost, I can't fit any more in this bowl.

1135
01:10:42,960 --> 01:11:00,989
Salt. Sourdough comes out of a can. What? Okay. Salt. That's a lot of salt.

1136
01:11:01,229 --> 01:11:15,979
Oh, shit. How much do I need? What? Sorry, I bullfrogged for a second. All right. 0.8.

1137
01:11:18,189 --> 01:11:29,949
And then 0.96 of yeast. This is just bullshit, to be honest. 0.96. Just, it's one ounce. It's one

1138
01:11:29,949 --> 01:11:52,380
ounce. Does it really have to be exact? Okay. I have not even turned this machine on. I don't

1139
01:11:52,380 --> 01:12:04,029
think it has to be exact. Stop using Imperial. I have to use Imperial. I would not be able to

1140
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:31,739
do it the other way. What is this? This is long bread, right? I hope. Do it. When are

1141
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:36,539
we gonna get new emotes? Here's when you're gonna get new emotes. I say every six months that new

1142
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:46,689
emotes are coming and I haven't added a new emote since 2018. So just take that, I guess, with how

1143
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:57,810
how you will. We just put it on BTTV. You know what I mean? It just goes on Better Twitch TV.

1144
01:13:15,579 --> 01:13:32,960
Boost. Does that hurt everybody's ears? Upgrade the oven. Oh my god. A good old simple oven can

1145
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:44,159
bake up to two oven trays. Why can I upgrade it? I just own it. Can I replace it? I don't think I

1146
01:13:44,159 --> 01:14:08,510
can replace it. You? I pressed you. That's me pressing you to open that sub menu. All right.

1147
01:14:09,149 --> 01:14:16,670
First person to get this right gets a pretend gold star. What song is this? Let's do it. Ready?

1148
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:21,470
What song is it? Mods keep track of your programs. I want to know who gets this first.

1149
01:14:21,470 --> 01:15:05,649
I'm not doing it again. They're fine. All right. I'm gonna say it. There was a Stone Cold Steve

1150
01:15:05,649 --> 01:15:25,020
Austin intro song. Did anybody get it? Anybody get it? Who said it? Who got it? See, in my brain,

1151
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:30,779
how did you not get that? To me, that is such an iconic piece of musical medley that there's

1152
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:40,800
no way you would not have gotten that. Nothing else sounds like that. By the way, do you guys

1153
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:48,800
think that the person that makes all the WWF, WCW, whatever theme songs, that person has more,

1154
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:55,069
they've made so many iconic pieces of music, right? Think about that.

1155
01:15:55,869 --> 01:16:03,069
Some of the most recognizable tunes ever created were made by the WWE music composer guy.

1156
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:14,699
Don't you feel like they deserve a lot more credit? You think the guy that made the Undertaker's theme

1157
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:20,659
song sits around going, that's one of the most recognizable, that's the Super Mario of music.

1158
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:42,979
Like seriously, I think he deserves a little more credit. It's not one guy. Well, it's, I don't know,

1159
01:16:42,979 --> 01:16:54,220
a group. Who makes it? That's the most boomer shit I've ever heard in my life. Okay, back up.

1160
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:04,029
If I played for you the first 10 seconds of Do You Smell What the Rock is Cookin' and then 10

1161
01:17:04,029 --> 01:17:09,069
seconds of whatever music is popular right now, how many people would recognize the Rock's theme

1162
01:17:09,069 --> 01:17:14,510
song versus something that is like popular kind of right now? How many humans on earth would

1163
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:27,010
recognize the Rock's theme song? And you tell me this is boomer shit. Relevancy bias in a hundred

1164
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:32,750
years. Is it really relevancy bias? Because I just told you right now that Stone Cold theme song,

1165
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:40,989
Glass Break. You know what that song is immediately. Everybody. Trends come and go,

1166
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:46,750
artists come and go, but Stone Cold Steve Austin's theme song is forever. You will never forget it.

1167
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:51,020
I'm sorry, I feel like that's pretty iconic. A hundred years from now, they'll know that.

1168
01:17:51,739 --> 01:17:59,039
I don't know that. I don't. I don't. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We didn't know. Literally,

1169
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:06,750
we couldn't do it. Yeah, but there's a difference between me going like, and you actually...

1170
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:11,859
There's a difference between... Hold on, let's just fucking... You know what I'm saying?

1171
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:20,510
Don't make me do this. Don't make me... Okay, here we go. How many people in chat know what this is?

1172
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:38,100
How many people in chat know what this is? I want to see it. Just shout it out when you get it.

1173
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:44,739
That's right. That's right. No, this is not the Home Depot theme song. This is...

1174
01:18:50,449 --> 01:19:01,579
This is not the Home Depot theme song. This is The World's Most Dangerous Man. Ken. Shamra.

1175
01:19:03,859 --> 01:19:06,899
It says... All right, I can see how it does sound a little like Home Depot.

1176
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:16,420
It sounds a little like Home Depot. Oh, fuck. It is Home Depot. How dare you

1177
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:21,939
not know what this is and know what Home Depot is? You've been consumed by capitalism.

1178
01:19:21,939 --> 01:19:26,819
You've been consumed by capitalism. This is Ken Shamrock's theme. This is not Home Depot theme

1179
01:19:26,819 --> 01:19:42,210
song. This is Ken Shamrock, The World's Most Dangerous Man. Okay, how about another one?

1180
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:54,529
Let's do this one. Who is this? You know, it doesn't matter if you choose left or right,

1181
01:19:54,529 --> 01:19:59,489
because they're both chewy, crunchy, and delicious. You know, it doesn't matter if you

1182
01:19:59,489 --> 01:20:07,310
choose left or... This is a Twix commercial. Twix is gross. Okay. I'm kidding. I love these things.

1183
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:19,310
I'm not going to even play anymore. Who is that? What is that? Don't you dare say the Taco Bell

1184
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:25,149
fucking commercials. I'll be pissed. Don't you dare. I know. Yeah. No, it's not Taco Bell. No,

1185
01:20:25,149 --> 01:20:29,710
it's not... Leave the bun behind. It's not you guys have been consumed by capitalism.

1186
01:20:31,569 --> 01:20:36,449
I saw it already. Taco Bell, Taco Bell, Taco Bell. This is the goddamn Undertaker.

1187
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:21,500
Why does it have to be Taco Bell? It's not fair. Here it comes. Somebody said this is what they

1188
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:45,100
played at the Taco Bell Chihuahua's funeral. Oh my God. You guys are too much. Okay. How about

1189
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:55,069
this one? Now, excuse me. I don't care. I don't give a shit who you are, how old you are.

1190
01:21:55,069 --> 01:22:02,670
Doesn't matter. If you guys, if this chat room does not become electric, electric when I play

1191
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:15,729
this, I'm going to prove my point right now. I'm going to wait until I know. I'm not even going to

1192
01:22:15,729 --> 01:22:23,340
play the intro. If this room does not become electric when you hear this, everyone spam it

1193
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:45,359
so I can prove my point. Let's see it. Spam it. Excuse me. What the fuck is happening right now?

1194
01:22:45,600 --> 01:23:03,180
I take a stand. It don't help to hide.

1195
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:15,279
Holy shit. This is not... What? That's Hulk Hogan's music. That's Hulkamania. What happened?

1196
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:32,430
Oh shit. I'm yelling at clouds again. Oh no. We only know three wrestlers. Undertaker,

1197
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:44,020
John Cena. Dude, we're like 20 years old. Shit. You're right. Nobody cares. Sorry.

1198
01:23:44,100 --> 01:24:06,960
Oh man. Okay. All right. I'll go make the bread again. Okay. I got, okay. I got one more for you.

1199
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:13,149
One more. Come on. Yeah. You guys, you guys should know this one, right? Let's see. Yeah. This is a,

1200
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:22,479
I think pretty popular wrestler. You guys should get this one. Come on. Everybody knows this one.

1201
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:47,949
We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. You don't know? Really? That's Gloom Man's theme song

1202
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:56,670
from Jerma Rumble live action. I can't say I'm disappointed, but I am. Let's go make bread.

1203
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:14,560
I have a shirt of that guy. Yeah. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm obviously too old.

1204
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:27,090
Fucking Home Depot theme song. That's seriously one of the funniest things that I've heard in a long

1205
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:34,430
time. I want to take like a five minute break to go laugh about that in the bathroom. You know what

1206
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:38,770
I mean? Just sit there and just laugh in the bathroom. Just like pissing. You know what I mean?

1207
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:57,500
I just want to laugh in the bathroom about that. Nine puppet buns. All right. Sure. It's the Home

1208
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:06,220
Depot Taco Bell Home Depot. You guys are fucking hilarious. All right. Where's my bowl? So wait,

1209
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:19,890
do I even? Can I put nine breads worth in here? I don't think so. Nine. I need 11 pounds of flour.

1210
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:43,199
I need a bigger bowl. Can I? Okay. I can't do that, right? Yeah. I can't fit anything in here.

1211
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:52,300
I need a bigger bowl. How do I get a bigger? Where do I buy a bigger bowl? Baking supplies?

1212
01:26:53,100 --> 01:27:05,899
Where's bowl? No, do not order everything. How do I get a bowl? Don't do it all at once.

1213
01:27:06,619 --> 01:27:12,340
But I wanted to. I don't want to. I want to do it all at once. God damn it. All right.

1214
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:19,420
Does it really matter? I don't think you can fail missions in this game. I don't care.

1215
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:27,979
No, give that back. Give that back. That was like that was eight pounds of flour. I threw in the

1216
01:27:27,979 --> 01:27:42,699
trash. Shit. Whatever. Oh my God. How much is that? Okay. 11.5. What's half 11.5?

1217
01:27:44,829 --> 01:28:03,500
It's close enough. I don't care. Okay. Water 2.5. I need more water. Shit. Oh my fucking God.

1218
01:28:10,189 --> 01:28:23,069
How big is this bowl? Why would I only have one bowl in this whole bakery? You've got to be

1219
01:28:23,069 --> 01:28:46,210
kidding me. I have one bowl in the whole bakery. What was that? Go use the toilet bowl. I can't

1220
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:59,069
even. Give me this goddamn thing. Come here. Okay. Stop tracking. Let's do two. These are

1221
01:28:59,069 --> 01:29:04,420
going to take forever. All right. Well, I'll do batches of three batches of four. Can I fit

1222
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:28,399
that? I don't know. This can hold eight and a half pounds. Okay. Two pints of water. One pint of milk.

1223
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:56,399
Salt. Okay. Sugar. Yeast. Sesame. I don't think I. Oh yeah. Okay. There it is. Sesame seeds.

1224
01:29:56,399 --> 01:30:06,979
When you put those on at the end, why would these go on now into the gross thick mixture?

1225
01:30:06,979 --> 01:30:20,909
Wouldn't you put these in like at the very end when you bake them? I guess not. Oh fuck. What's

1226
01:30:20,909 --> 01:30:39,470
wrong? 1.1 ounces of sesame. I don't. I can't hold that much in the bowl. Whatever. Upgrade the bowl.

1227
01:30:40,109 --> 01:31:02,510
I don't think I can. Get a bigger bowl. Okay. So this is puppets bread. What kind of bread is

1228
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:28,140
puppets bread? Is it a baguette croissant? What kind of bread is that? Is it long bread? No. You

1229
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:49,260
idiot. Whatever. This batch sucks. I don't care. I just want a nice warm piece of bread right now.

1230
01:31:52,699 --> 01:32:02,140
Just super crunchy. Is there a bread that I don't like? I'm trying to think if there's a

1231
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:14,239
bread I actually don't like. No. Don't even put it in yet. I have two trays. All right. Back to it.

1232
01:32:15,779 --> 01:32:27,069
I need to make nine, right? Okay. So I need to make five more. Can I fit? Okay. I'm just going

1233
01:32:27,069 --> 01:32:32,909
to do a shitty batch. I don't care. We're going to do five. Yeah. We're going to make a shitty

1234
01:32:32,909 --> 01:32:42,500
batch. I'm just going to cut this whole thing in half and whatever. It's going to the bread's

1235
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:51,460
going to be a little stringy. I don't care. All right. Wheat flour. What was that? Somebody just

1236
01:32:51,460 --> 01:33:05,899
went like, okay, I don't want to go too hard here. That's fine. A little bit less water than usual.

1237
01:33:10,369 --> 01:33:24,460
Okay. That's fine. A little bit less milk than usual. Okay. Salt is fine. Okay. Wait, pull that

1238
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:40,060
back. Okay. Sugar. I want to see if I can fit the rest of it. One ounce. Where is it? Oh, up here.

1239
01:33:40,060 --> 01:34:05,359
Fuck. I can't fit it. Shit. How do I upgrade the bowl? I can't even put it. I can't just shove a

1240
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:11,789
bowl full of milk into the oven. Although I'm going to try. No, I can't. What if I just hold

1241
01:34:11,789 --> 01:34:32,210
it like this? Will it cook? Fuck. I have to do it right. Um, just give me. I'm going to do two or

1242
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:47,859
whatever. I don't care. I'll do three track. I can do three reliably. Yeah. Buy more of this shit.

1243
01:34:47,859 --> 01:35:13,439
That's fine. Okay. Water. Okay. Milk. Salt. Who's trying to get my attention behind me?

1244
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:31,100
Okay. Sugar. Yeast. All right. Now I can do the right sesame seeds. All right.

1245
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:40,479
Am I feeding a shit load of birds? What the hell? Why do I have so many seeds in here?

1246
01:35:40,479 --> 01:36:09,819
There's a lot. That's a lot of bird seed. Okay. Turn around. I broke it. This bread sucks. Baked

1247
01:36:09,819 --> 01:36:16,350
milk. What would baked milk even be? It would, nothing would happen. It would just be good.

1248
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:24,510
It would get hot. All right. If, if you put milk and a little bit of yeast into the milk,

1249
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:27,869
what would happen? Okay. A little bit of, all right. What would happen if you did this?

1250
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:37,380
If you took milk, yeast and sugar and you put them together and baked it, what would happen?

1251
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:47,939
You just put it in an oven safe bowl and put it in the oven. What would happen? It would just be

1252
01:36:48,659 --> 01:36:55,699
custard. It would just be flavorless, flourless cheese. This flour and cheese. It would just be

1253
01:36:55,699 --> 01:37:09,020
sour. What did? It would be cheese. Isn't cheese a much different process though? Those of you asking

1254
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:14,819
why I'm doing this is to be able to get nine of them. What the fuck are you talking about?

1255
01:37:24,529 --> 01:37:38,180
I thought I was going to be able to split them. It wouldn't be cheese. No. Oh, that one's ugly.

1256
01:37:38,739 --> 01:37:54,819
Whatever. They don't even care. I still get 80% guys. This is whatever. I'm going to take them

1257
01:37:54,819 --> 01:38:08,909
out anyways. I have to wait. I still have 12 minutes. What hair gel do you use? I don't use

1258
01:38:08,909 --> 01:38:22,539
hair gel. I don't put any product in my hair ever. All right. Come on. Let's go. Liar. That's not a

1259
01:38:22,539 --> 01:38:37,810
lie. I shampoo and condition, but that's it. No, I don't put hair gel in my hair. Do you know why

1260
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:42,560
I don't put any product in my hair? Because all the way from when I was a teenager up until

1261
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:51,199
my late 20s, anytime I put hair gel in my hair, I would get this. It didn't matter if it was,

1262
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:54,399
oh, you got to get a different brand. You got to get this brand. You got to use a pomade. Don't

1263
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:58,319
use that. Use mousse. Didn't matter what I did. Use a lot. Don't use that much. Use a little. It

1264
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:07,470
doesn't matter. I would get this line right here. This line of acne that because it would just get

1265
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:14,210
kind of greasy and sweaty and I hated it. And I'd get this line of pimples and acne. So I just

1266
01:39:14,210 --> 01:39:17,409
started saying, you know, I'm going to use a really good conditioner, really good shampoo,

1267
01:39:17,409 --> 01:39:31,869
like very, very high quality and go from there. And I don't put anything in my hair. I, I'm missing

1268
01:39:31,869 --> 01:39:40,189
two. All right, two. Where's the bowl? All right, two more breads. It can be cold, but they'll get

1269
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:50,979
it. Okay, let's go. I mean, plus my hair is kind of wavy anyway, so I don't really need to put

1270
01:39:50,979 --> 01:40:01,460
that, nothing in my hair. My hair will naturally just go swoop, swoop, swoop. Baked milk. Baked

1271
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:10,270
milk might be better for you. It's good for people with intestinal issues. Holy shit. Okay.

1272
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:29,739
All right. Water. What song was that? What song was that one? It was Super Mario. Sorry,

1273
01:40:29,739 --> 01:40:50,979
you got it wrong. All right. Where's the, what the fuck is going on? This one would be normal.

1274
01:40:50,979 --> 01:41:15,729
This one's gonna be good. It's all right. 2.6, 2.5, 2.52, 2.48, 2.44, 2.4. That's what I did.

1275
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:33,729
All right. Um, I can probably start putting these away. What? Uh, excuse me. Puppets bun.

1276
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:54,420
Puppets bread. What's the difference? Puppets bread. Puppets bun. I mean, these, these ones got

1277
01:41:54,420 --> 01:42:09,569
bacteria growing on them anyways. That's annoying. Oh my God. I'm about to quit the game. I'm about

1278
01:42:09,569 --> 01:42:27,920
to quit the game. I'm going to quit the game. Um, all right. Well, let me see if I can, how many do

1279
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:41,979
I have in here? So it's not a lot. So it would be a round bread. This is correct, right? This would

1280
01:42:41,979 --> 01:42:53,899
be a puppet bun. I only have enough for two. How do I only have enough for two? Bro, I don't know.

1281
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:17,119
Cringe fail baker. This is not even accurate. This is puppets bread still. How do I make a

1282
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:31,979
bun? What? Bagels, croissants, baguettes, long breads. Oh my, it's literally right there.

1283
01:43:32,859 --> 01:43:37,739
Oh my God. That's annoying. Just put it back on here and we'll redo it. Just reform it.

1284
01:43:38,300 --> 01:44:05,789
Holy shit. I think I have enough to do it. I have enough to do it. This is saved. No, I have enough

1285
01:44:05,789 --> 01:44:29,920
to do it. I have six minutes, but I should be okay. How many is that? This is one, two, three,

1286
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:48,659
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. All right. That's nine. Go puppets. These are buns. How are

1287
01:44:48,659 --> 01:44:53,220
these still? I don't understand. That's buns. I just chopped them into buns and I formed them into

1288
01:44:53,220 --> 01:45:24,460
buns. I don't care. Those are literally buns. Go to the clipboard. What's happening? Who's that?

1289
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:32,220
Oh, I was like, who the fuck is this three puppets alone in the dark? I was like, who is this?

1290
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:53,710
I didn't accept the recipe. So what can I? I'm so confused. Self-made tasks. All right. Whatever.

1291
01:45:53,710 --> 01:46:06,859
I'll start over. I only have four minutes. Just quit. Just redo it. Somebody just walked in with

1292
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:23,600
a fucking pan and went like right in the back of my head and I just went to black. Okay.

1293
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:41,140
$700. Let's go. Okay. Three farmers loaf. All right. Farmers loaf. You got it. What do I need?

1294
01:46:41,699 --> 01:47:03,020
I can do this one. All right. 2.4. My eye. 2.4. That's a lot of water. I'm gonna run out of money.

1295
01:47:09,949 --> 01:47:27,460
Fuck off. Okay. Good. All right. Rye flour. 1.8 pounds of rye flour.

1296
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:48,220
Sour dough starter. You put a pint of this? What? I thought it was just like baking soda.

1297
01:47:48,220 --> 01:48:00,909
I didn't think it was something else. What's in this? I need to buy more of this shit. Okay.

1298
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:10,899
I thought it was baking soda. It's ridiculously hard to get right.

1299
01:48:15,539 --> 01:48:31,659
Do I have no money? Oh, you guys have any experience making sour dough? All right. 1.4

1300
01:48:31,739 --> 01:48:43,810
ounces of salt. I'll get it right first try. All right. Only 15 seconds in the mixer.

1301
01:48:49,979 --> 01:49:02,420
You have to put bugs in it. I don't think you do. Okay. Then this is bake for 70 seconds at...

1302
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:14,619
Did I spill any? Oh, I don't just bake it. I have to form it. All right. What is a farmer's loaf?

1303
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:40,210
What's a farmer's loaf? Is it a longbread? I hope that's right. I need three. How the fuck is this

1304
01:49:40,930 --> 01:49:54,289
not? Yeah, that's two and one little tiny shitty one. Dude, I could go for a huge pretzel right now.

1305
01:49:55,250 --> 01:50:03,359
You know what? Honestly, a big crunchy hot pretzel. This might shock some of you.

1306
01:50:04,369 --> 01:50:09,020
Might be the single greatest food item that's ever been invented by humans.

1307
01:50:09,659 --> 01:50:17,869
It really actually could be. If I really sit here and I really think about it,

1308
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:22,260
that could be the greatest tasting greatest thing in the world. In the whole world.

1309
01:50:24,909 --> 01:50:29,970
Golf sucks. Yeah, it does. I'm not... Why do you think I'm going to disagree with you on that?

1310
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:37,729
Donuts are better. No, they're not. No, a pretzel. A nice hot soft pretzel with a thing of

1311
01:50:37,729 --> 01:50:41,890
honey mustard or spicy mustard or even like cheese, nacho cheese or something.

1312
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:49,729
Or just straight up right out of the oven. Just a little bit of salt on it. Oh my god. Pizza's

1313
01:50:49,729 --> 01:51:04,899
perfect. Yeah, a really good pizza. I don't think it makes me have a child's palette.

1314
01:51:06,510 --> 01:51:11,229
I think, oh man, the best steak I've ever had in my life. The best steak. No,

1315
01:51:12,109 --> 01:51:15,949
I would rather take the best pizza I've ever had in my life over the best steak I've ever had in my

1316
01:51:15,949 --> 01:51:21,010
life. Also, I'd rather have the best piece of salmon I've ever had in my life over the best

1317
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:25,810
steak I've ever had in my life. Steak is overrated. It just really... I don't know. I think I really

1318
01:51:25,810 --> 01:51:37,310
just think it is. I genuinely believe that. I know it's really good. It is. But I just... I

1319
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:58,029
kind of think it's overrated. Pizza and salmon pog. When I have a really nice piece of meat... Oh,

1320
01:51:58,029 --> 01:52:04,670
wow, dude. This is like ribeye or this is wagyu. Whatever. I've had it before. It's like, yeah,

1321
01:52:04,670 --> 01:52:10,590
that was... Yeah, that was really, really... That was really good. But it's not good enough for me

1322
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:18,979
to care that much to me. I think it's incredibly... It is. It's very good. But I don't know. The best

1323
01:52:18,979 --> 01:52:21,699
piece of fish I've ever had is higher than the best piece of steak I've ever had.

1324
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:46,130
But then it's not even a red meat thing for me because... Okay, I love cheeseburgers. I love

1325
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:54,159
steak and cheese subs. Steak bomb, right? I love meatballs. I love red meat. But I don't like the

1326
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:58,000
red meat where the red meat is just, hey, eat it. It's just a piece of red meat on a plate.

1327
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:06,930
No, I don't like that. It needs more. It needs to be... There's gotta be something else there.

1328
01:53:09,789 --> 01:53:15,789
Season it. You know what I mean? I don't... I'm just not into the whole... All right. I got a steak

1329
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:22,449
and then there's broccoli and mashed potatoes on the plate too. Even with a good bunch of

1330
01:53:22,449 --> 01:53:34,289
good seasoning or a marinade or whatever. Garlic herb butter. Yeah, it's phenomenal.

1331
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:48,050
It's phenomenal. You're right. But I've had a piece of salmon before that I'm not kidding. And

1332
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:55,340
look, you can say this about a steak you had too, but I've never... I've had a piece of salmon before.

1333
01:53:55,340 --> 01:54:00,699
I don't remember the restaurant. I genuinely don't remember. I do not know. It was in the

1334
01:54:00,699 --> 01:54:08,100
north end in Boston and I seriously thought that... It felt like God came down and talked to me for

1335
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:16,239
like 10 minutes. It was just... It came out. It was no bullshit. It was just this delicious

1336
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:22,640
fresh piece of salmon and the fork... It was sitting on, I think, a piece of asparagus,

1337
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:28,479
whatever the hell it was. And I remember taking my fork and I went to go touch it and the whole

1338
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:34,640
thing disintegrated. It was just like... It's like, what the holy... So then you fork off a little bit

1339
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:42,350
and by the time it hit my lips right here, it was like cotton candy. It was just like...

1340
01:54:47,619 --> 01:54:52,619
It was like cotton candy. It didn't taste like cotton candy, but it acted like that.

1341
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:57,329
It was just gone. And I remember just going like this. I dropped the fork. I went like...

1342
01:54:58,609 --> 01:55:07,420
And I was with my family and I was just like, I don't know. I don't even know what I can say

1343
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:28,930
about that. Ratatouille? Did you eat cat food? Whatever. It was so good. And I remember when

1344
01:55:29,649 --> 01:55:34,210
the waiter came over, I remember just... And do this, by the way. If you really do like something,

1345
01:55:34,210 --> 01:55:37,970
I'm serious. Please start doing this. If you eat something at a restaurant and you go,

1346
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:42,369
that was actually really, really well made and really well done. That was fantastic. That was

1347
01:55:42,369 --> 01:55:52,130
unbelievable. Tell the waiter. Go, hey, tell who was back there that that was fucking phenomenal.

1348
01:55:52,130 --> 01:55:56,369
That was phenomenal. And they should be proud of that. They should be absolutely proud of what

1349
01:55:56,369 --> 01:56:04,659
they did. I'm serious. And then they go back there, they say, hey, the salmon at table four,

1350
01:56:04,659 --> 01:56:09,180
they were like, that was the best salmon they've ever had. You know what I mean? They need to know

1351
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:24,939
that. They've got to know. That's not ratatouille. Wouldn't ratatouille be if I hated food and hated

1352
01:56:24,939 --> 01:56:32,079
the restaurant or something from a chef that makes our day? Yeah. And guess what? If you know that

1353
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:35,039
somebody is eating your food and they think it's like one of the best things they've ever had in

1354
01:56:35,039 --> 01:56:42,270
their life, that that's going to be all right. Let's go. Let's go. You like that salmon? You

1355
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:50,260
should try my catfish. Give that a try. I've got I've got a risotto on this menu. It's going to be

1356
01:56:50,260 --> 01:57:08,750
good. Did you ask for the chef's number? Okay, so let's go. What am I doing? What about that's a

1357
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:15,420
rich person restaurant? No. Some of the best food that I've had has come from places that were not

1358
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:22,100
expensive. It's the person behind the goddamn curtain. Don't you understand? It's the person

1359
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:32,029
behind the curtain. I've been to really expensive restaurants and the food sucked absolute asshole.

1360
01:57:32,029 --> 01:57:38,100
I've been to restaurants where you'd go holy shit this is that's how much the entrees are

1361
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:57,699
and some of the best food I've had in a long time. It's the person behind the curtain.

1362
01:57:57,699 --> 01:58:06,140
That's a weird flex. Guys, I've been to McDonald's that are better than some five-star restaurants

1363
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:18,289
I've been to. I'm telling you this is my real take. The way that I feel biting into a double

1364
01:58:18,289 --> 01:58:25,010
cheeseburger from McDonald's and how delicious it is and then eating oh this is a pan seared

1365
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:34,449
freaking fish steak with tuna grazed a row on it and it has a piece of parsley all over it and it's

1366
01:58:34,449 --> 01:58:39,890
I don't like this. I've eaten stuff like that before and I've had stuff like

1367
01:58:39,890 --> 01:58:45,489
that that was very good and I've had stuff like that that's very bad. Would you ever eat a snake?

1368
01:58:45,489 --> 01:58:55,439
No. No. Nice child's palate. I know for a fact that there are people in this chat right now

1369
01:58:55,439 --> 01:59:00,800
that have eaten at McDonald's and had a five-star restaurant like filet mignon and went that one

1370
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:07,920
sucked that was not that great that actually was kind of not good. I know for a fact you've done

1371
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:16,989
it. I'm positive. I know for a fact that you've been sitting in the back of a car that went to

1372
01:59:16,989 --> 01:59:22,510
the drive-thru and you were eating fries out of the bag sneaking them. Just eating fries out of

1373
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:28,510
the bag you weren't a bunch of friends whatever and you enjoyed that more than the like a tuna

1374
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:33,899
tartar that you had at a four-star restaurant before. I know it. Don't pull one over on me

1375
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:43,630
and by the way why are you eating tuna tartar? Why are you eating steak tartar? What's wrong with you?

1376
01:59:49,149 --> 01:59:55,789
Somebody on the phone right now that that called the restaurant so I mean I ordered three pieces

1377
01:59:55,789 --> 02:00:01,659
of farmer's loaf for you. Is that coming or? This delivery I've already burnt five minutes.

1378
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:14,689
Tuna tartar is sushi. All right yeah no no no that's right. Steak tartar though I'm sorry.

1379
02:00:15,810 --> 02:00:22,619
I'm sorry. I just I don't understand why people do that. I don't understand why people do that.

1380
02:00:22,619 --> 02:00:32,180
I don't get it. What is it? Tell me what it is about it. Steak tartar is but tell me why.

1381
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:45,569
Tell me why. Why are there so many viewers? I don't know. Wait okay somebody called me an idiot.

1382
02:00:45,569 --> 02:00:51,970
Hold on. Somebody said you're a fucking idiot. Why? But why? Somebody said why oh why do you

1383
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:55,729
say tartar like that you fucking idiot. I thought you were calling me an idiot because you liked

1384
02:00:55,729 --> 02:01:03,659
tartar and you were giving me a reason why. How am I saying it wrong? Steak tartar. Tartar. How do

1385
02:01:03,659 --> 02:01:15,890
you say it? That's how you say it. Tartar. Tartar. Tartar. Tartar. What? I might you guys follow?

1386
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:37,090
I'm saying it right? That's correct. Steak tartar. Steak tartar. Okay thank you. Steak tartar.

1387
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:47,229
One more time for everybody that was listening. Steak tartar. How do you pronounce steak tartar

1388
02:01:47,229 --> 02:02:10,770
correctly? It's a regional thing? Oh I have an ad. Announce this name as well as how to say more

1389
02:02:10,770 --> 02:02:16,609
interesting French cooking terms too that many get wrong so make sure to stay tuned for those.

1390
02:02:16,609 --> 02:02:24,609
Okay this is the real deal. This is a meat dash made from raw ground beef. Some say it can also

1391
02:02:24,609 --> 02:02:31,890
be made from horse even though even in France that's really not very common. Anyhow how do you

1392
02:02:31,890 --> 02:02:40,210
say it? For reference in French in France it is said as steak tartar. Oh come on! Therefore in

1393
02:02:40,210 --> 02:02:48,529
English it is generally said as steak tartar. And that by the way this is directly from I went

1394
02:02:52,500 --> 02:03:07,279
I went. Steak tartar. Steak tartar. That's what I said. Why are people so mean to me?

1395
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:15,920
Okay that was 11 minutes by the way. The guy on the phone is still there. I don't care about

1396
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:20,560
steak tartar dude. I mean you have like you've got like a five star review so I'm gonna sit

1397
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:34,510
here and wait for the bread. But are you all right? All right let's go. Track it. What am I

1398
02:03:34,829 --> 02:03:46,689
even doing? French is not a real language. Okay I don't know. What does that mean? All right.

1399
02:03:46,689 --> 02:03:58,000
Bronze bread. Four. Let's go. Why are we what? Five pounds of rye flour. Is this gonna be too much?

1400
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:11,199
I understand. Okay raw. I understand raw food like raw fish right? I understand it. But something

1401
02:04:11,199 --> 02:04:25,489
about raw hamburger meat. Raw hamburger meat smells. It has this smell to it. Kind of like

1402
02:04:25,489 --> 02:04:32,699
I talked about with raw eggs. I don't want to eat that. And it's not ground beef. What do you mean?

1403
02:04:32,699 --> 02:04:40,510
It's a hamburger meat. It's raw meat. Yeah all right I get it. You're not going to the grocery

1404
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:46,960
store and getting a pound of ground beef and eating it raw with a fork. Okay hold on. Hold

1405
02:04:46,960 --> 02:05:17,119
that thought. Yeast okay. Salt. Sugar. Whoa too much. It's the natural way of eating it.

1406
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:34,449
I just don't like it. I don't know. And I'm not even saying it. Dude it needs to be

1407
02:05:34,449 --> 02:05:42,750
well done. I'm just saying it needs to be cooked. All right but honestly who started cooking food?

1408
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:59,090
Why did we start cooking food then? Right like who started cooking food? Cavemen? So you're telling

1409
02:05:59,090 --> 02:06:09,039
me that the cavemen were like raw meat. Yes. And then all of a sudden they put it over a fire

1410
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:18,829
and then went good good good good good good good. And they all started fucking screaming.

1411
02:06:19,789 --> 02:06:24,109
They decided that. We didn't. The only reason why we do this now is because the cavemen decided to

1412
02:06:24,909 --> 02:06:42,640
burn a warthog that they fucking found in the forest. What was this again? I don't remember.

1413
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:55,279
All right bronze bread and it's just a regular brown bread. We started cooking food. Hold on

1414
02:06:55,279 --> 02:06:58,880
somebody's got the answer. Actually I'm very curious about this. I really am. I swear to god.

1415
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:03,819
Cooking food allowed us to get more nutrients out of it so people who cooked food survived

1416
02:07:03,819 --> 02:07:10,430
more than those that didn't. We started cooking food because our teeth became less sharp and we

1417
02:07:10,430 --> 02:07:16,670
also didn't want to die of diseases. You English major. Different people do different specialties

1418
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:20,510
and that's what I need to know every single thing. I have to be a doctor, an English teacher,

1419
02:07:20,510 --> 02:07:40,880
a scientist, and an astronaut. People do different things but to me to me it tastes better.

1420
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:48,079
Like a medium even like medium rare right? Like medium to medium rare medium to me just that

1421
02:07:48,079 --> 02:07:53,659
tastes better to me than just eating it raw. And we add you know garlic and butter and flavors and

1422
02:07:53,659 --> 02:08:11,699
parsley. Oh I want one now. Bro this is high school knowledge. Yeah that's what the cavemen

1423
02:08:11,699 --> 02:08:25,470
thought too. You know how many people it's crazy to think about this honestly.

1424
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:33,439
The flavors that we like over thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

1425
02:08:35,090 --> 02:08:39,090
Cavemen were just going and picking up berries and squishing them and putting them on their

1426
02:08:39,090 --> 02:08:55,970
steak and eating it and just dying. No no no don't eat us. It's crazy like I'm

1427
02:08:55,970 --> 02:09:02,350
under the first person to piss on the fire. No pee piss on fire. No I don't know. I don't

1428
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:28,689
know about that. Yes flavor. And then they ate that guy. Where's my bread? They didn't start

1429
02:09:28,689 --> 02:09:42,350
making bread until pee pee on food. Yeah they had to be away. You would eat a person? No I'm

1430
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:47,859
saying that. They maybe I don't know. I wouldn't. I'm just saying in fact I'm fucking million years

1431
02:09:47,859 --> 02:10:03,869
ago. Guys they didn't have the McDonald's drive-thru. I don't know. I don't know. You

1432
02:10:03,869 --> 02:10:25,890
don't know what it was like a million years ago. Nice granddad joke. You guys are fucking so funny.

1433
02:10:31,489 --> 02:10:35,729
Yeah they used to they must they they probably put so much gross shit all over their food.

1434
02:10:36,369 --> 02:10:45,699
You imagine how disgusting food probably was for a long time. That's for us to to complain.

1435
02:10:46,739 --> 02:11:10,239
Oh um excuse me. This drink is a little too sweet. Redo it. They had steak tartare though and I'm

1436
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:20,350
sure it was good. That's literally you. I actually I actually don't complain about food if it's wrong.

1437
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:39,380
I really don't. Okay it has to be very very wrong. Very wrong. You know how much of a pain in the

1438
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:45,970
ass it is to deal with a shitload of people. You know it's crazy. All right here we go. Okay

1439
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:51,659
everyone hold on. Here comes a take. The amount of people that you see in let's say like a

1440
02:11:51,659 --> 02:11:56,220
McDonald's drive-thru. Think of the how crazy it gets at a lot of these places.

1441
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:07,119
There are sometimes 10 plus 20 cars for hours outside of these McDonald's restaurants or

1442
02:12:07,119 --> 02:12:16,100
Burger King. It doesn't matter. It's oh no you I wanted a Sprite and you gave me a Coke.

1443
02:12:17,250 --> 02:12:22,109
Okay that's all right. Like whatever. It's not that's not a big deal. It's not that big of a deal.

1444
02:12:22,109 --> 02:12:32,340
That's not a big deal to me. It really isn't. Now if I ordered you know two double cheeseburgers uh

1445
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:38,819
fry and a Coke and I got three chicken sandwiches uh McFlurry and like this is not my order. This is

1446
02:12:38,819 --> 02:12:43,699
not even close. Like I'll be like oh hey this is it's no problem at all but this is uh probably

1447
02:12:43,699 --> 02:12:57,630
somebody else's order. All right what's what's the next? What's coming up? What am I even on? Okay wait

1448
02:12:57,630 --> 02:13:13,390
didn't I do this? Wow that's a great take. That really wasn't a take really now that I yeah you're

1449
02:13:13,390 --> 02:13:23,069
right. That actually wasn't a take. What was the take? I just said that's fucking crazy.

1450
02:13:24,029 --> 02:13:33,310
That's not a take. Hey dude that's crazy. All right let's move on. The take is I don't complain.

1451
02:13:34,579 --> 02:13:39,300
Oh that's right. Well no no no my take is that. All right here's the take. That a lot of people

1452
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:44,260
that work in the fast food industry have to deal with a lot of horse shit and I don't want to be

1453
02:13:44,260 --> 02:13:47,939
one of those people that adds to the stress of like a bunch of people fucking screaming at

1454
02:13:47,939 --> 02:13:51,539
them through the intercom and like fucking with them through the like you know like fucking with

1455
02:13:51,539 --> 02:14:03,140
them and it's a lot of bullshit um so I don't know I try to and why can't we tip at the fucking window

1456
02:14:14,579 --> 02:14:23,260
some places they can't no we can't we can't we can't do that not saying that like you know you

1457
02:14:23,260 --> 02:14:32,770
know obviously people you know tipping is a whole nother can of worms right but a lot of places you

1458
02:14:32,770 --> 02:14:46,619
can't why do we have to tip yeah I know I know I know it's a confusing and it's like the worker

1459
02:14:46,619 --> 02:14:53,340
is relying on your tip because they're just not getting paid to be there at a wage that's a

1460
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:59,340
reasonable fucking wage right so it's like is it 20% is it 15% is it 40% 30% is it 12% what if I do

1461
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:04,140
15% is that bad what's wrong what did you do what's your tip we're doing tips together should we

1462
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:12,909
give 50 should I give $100 I'm gonna give $100 should I give 10 I get it I do but I will also

1463
02:15:12,909 --> 02:15:19,260
be honest too though I do like to if somebody's you know really nice they do a good job and it's

1464
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:24,640
like you know you're actually you're working your ass off here fuck it I'll give you why not I get

1465
02:15:24,640 --> 02:15:37,170
it but that that's on me right that's on the individual yeah really doing a good job placing

1466
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:49,279
trays over and over again but and sometimes tipping is gets weird because I how expensive

1467
02:15:49,279 --> 02:16:06,159
was the meal right where where it gets weird technically we paid for the tip yeah you know

1468
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:14,989
also too like a lot of times tipping if if the restaurant just paid the you know you think about

1469
02:16:14,989 --> 02:16:20,989
what your check would be right let's say your check is $20 or 30 $40 the extra money that you'd be

1470
02:16:20,989 --> 02:16:26,609
tipping I don't know how somebody there's probably some mathematician or economist in here

1471
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:34,459
but like if you took away the tipping and even if you needed to charge a little more for the food

1472
02:16:34,459 --> 02:16:41,899
I'm not paying potentially more to tip and pay for the food and you could pay potentially the

1473
02:16:41,899 --> 02:16:52,430
workers better right can an economist tell me that here even if you made the the food more

1474
02:16:52,430 --> 02:16:57,500
expensive by enough but it wasn't it didn't reach that point where it was the tip on top of it

1475
02:16:57,500 --> 02:17:05,600
right run a restaurant then you get back to me um I know I'm dude I'm talking up my ass I know
