1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:01:09,049
Hi. Hold on, I gotta grab my... One sec. Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. Good evening.

2
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:21,480
We are gonna do... It is Saturday. I don't know what that means the last few weeks. That means

3
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:39,540
Microsoft Distributed Operating System. Microsoft Operating System. We ended last

4
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:47,319
night very late, so I figured I'd give myself another hour or two. Still in the window though.

5
00:01:50,579 --> 00:02:03,189
Doink occupied the stream? Like dunk the clown? Did Cox finally fix the internet? No,

6
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:16,389
unfortunately not. We still have problems, but we did change over IPs and we have static IP now.

7
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:21,830
They know there's a problem. They know it exists, but I don't think they can fix it because

8
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:30,330
of a million different things. And I feel like I've been talking about this the last

9
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,729
week straight. So I'd like to not even think about the internet. You know,

10
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:42,300
I don't even want to think about it. Let's just pretend it's not a problem until it is one.

11
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:55,060
Right? Ten years. But it was actually... It was all right yesterday. Yesterday was fine.

12
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,800
And then into today. Seems like it's okay. I mean, probably gonna drop frames, but I

13
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,259
don't think it'll be a huge issue. Although I've been wrong many times before. I mean,

14
00:03:08,259 --> 00:04:21,829
just make a tweet and I'll be right back when we get started. Alrighty. Welcome. I'm ready to

15
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:33,420
check out a few more of these games. Why not DOS and DOS nots? Because it's do's and do's nots.

16
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:41,060
No, it's do and do nots. DOS and do nots. Whatever. Title's not changed.

17
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:54,300
What does the title say? DOS and do nots. Yeah, like do's and do nots.

18
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,660
Some of these are great. Some of these are like I'm not even going to click them. So

19
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:17,060
do's and do nots? Well, then you can't have the S. DOS and do nots. Speaking of DOS

20
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,449
and not necessarily do nots. Take a look at that. So the last time we did this,

21
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,230
I will show you. We did... We changed categories. Instead of... We see here where

22
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:36,259
we are up here. This is where we started. I was sorting by views last time. The time

23
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:41,050
before that. And then the last time we did this, I just kind of picked a random page.

24
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,339
So today we're going to go back to like the popular tab and we're going to go down

25
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,100
to where we were last time. There's Super Mario's Video Game Gallery. We can tell

26
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,740
that's a good one. I already know that's a good one. So this is where we ended up

27
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,180
two... three weeks ago, right? Because I remember Dangerous Dave's Haunted Mansion

28
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:12,970
and then we ended up about here. Right here. Just about. So because of the way that these

29
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:17,370
they kind of move up and down, they're not in a straight line anymore. I would say the only

30
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,139
ones you should be clicking on are the ones that the text is visible. Right? Don't click on these

31
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:31,480
ones down here, right? Because I... We don't know what they are. Visible text only. And if you

32
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,529
have a moment, I would just love if you would pick the first game we're going to play

33
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:53,379
right now. What? Okay. You guys clicked so fast that you broke the click thing. And no,

34
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,459
porn games are not going to be played. Remember, this is DOS and DOS nots. This is

35
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:12,470
DOS and DOS nots. I'll change that title. That's better. What do we got? By the way,

36
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:19,959
the rules have changed. We're going to do three on this list. Just pick three and then we'll

37
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:29,879
move on. It looks like I'm going to play The Hobbit. It just... I guess it's the title

38
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,199
that everybody... Just click on that one, Jeremy, because it says Hobbit in the title.

39
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:46,310
Like bugs to a lamp. All right. Can you guys even see my cursor? That's odd. You should

40
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:52,329
be able to see my cursor. All right. Thank you. Now, I'm going to click on The Hobbit

41
00:07:52,329 --> 00:08:05,589
and let's go. For some reason, you guys are still on the screen. Okay. This is 1993 from

42
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:14,100
Milbus Software. And we need to... What do we have to do? What are we changing? What?

43
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:28,009
Why can you guys not see this? What the fuck is going on here? Oh, right. I remember.

44
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:32,549
Okay. I remember. I remember because my scene is messed up. Because last time we did this,

45
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,470
I had to... Remember, I zoomed in really far because we couldn't read the text.

46
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:47,450
Here, I'll just do this. Fix this real quick. Yeah, I remember now. There we go. Okay. All

47
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:55,190
right. Here we go. Choose monitor type. This is mono or color. Mono means it's going to be

48
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:01,240
black and white, right? So we need to... We want to do color. Kind of wish I picked the

49
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:11,580
other one. The Hobbit. Press space to begin the game. Choose display with 40 or 80.

50
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:21,990
I mean, we have to do 80, right? Do you want... What? 8? No, no, no. I want 80.

51
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:30,360
I don't want 8. Do I want pictures? Oh my god. What the fuck is happening?

52
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,330
I didn't pick 8 resolution. Did I? That's not possible. It's 80. You are in a comfortable

53
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:46,070
tunnel-like hall with a perfectly round green door like a porthole. Ow! You are in a

54
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,820
comfortable tunnel-like hall with a perfectly round green door like a porthole. The walls

55
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,980
are paneled. The floors are tiled and carpeted, and there are a number of polished chairs

56
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,620
around the walls. To the east there's a round green door. You can see Gandalf.

57
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,899
Gandalf is carrying a curious map. Thorin, the wooden chest. Gandalf gives the curious map

58
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,419
to you. Thorin, rising to his feet, says to you, well, Mr. Baggins, it's all ready

59
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:10,220
for our adventure. And I must say they're looking very hopeful. Shall we be off then?

60
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,259
You wait. Time passes. Gandalf opens the round green door. You wait. Time passes.

61
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:18,039
Gandalf goes east. You wait. Time passes. What do I need to do? You wait. Wait. Wait.

62
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,879
I don't see the ring anywhere. Wait. What am I supposed to do? You wait. Okay. Freak me out.

63
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:44,940
Go east. What? You are in a gloomy empty land with dreary hills ahead, rising higher and

64
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:55,289
higher, dark with trees. On some of the hills are old castles that have a very evil look

65
00:10:55,289 --> 00:11:02,039
about them. To the west there is the round green door. Visible exits are east, north,

66
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,539
and northeast. You can see nothing. Thorin enters. Thorin? Where? What do you mean Thorin

67
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:20,179
enters? Where is he? You attack Thorin, but the effort is wasted. His defense is too strong.

68
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,580
Thorin attacks you, but the effect is wasted. Your defense is too strong.

69
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,250
You have mastered two percent of the adventure. You are dead. What? With one well

70
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:52,379
placed blow, Thorin cleaves you. Cleaves your skull. You are dead. The story of Phil

71
00:11:52,379 --> 00:12:02,330
Vovagans. The Hobbit. A wizard is never late, nor is he early. A wizard wait when he's dead.

72
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:16,519
Who killed him? Who killed him? Can I restart? Oh yes, of course I do. Let's try this again.

73
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,799
Gary, you're in the green door. I'm inside my hobbit place, right?

74
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:31,350
Gandalf is carrying a curious map. Look at the map. Look what? Map. You look at the curious map.

75
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,669
It is a map drawn on a piece of parchment of the area around the lonely mountain.

76
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:39,909
There seem to be some symbols on it, but you cannot read them. Gandalf opens the round

77
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:45,419
green door. Thorin says, well, are we going to just stand here all day? Okay,

78
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:55,779
Gandalf goes east. Follow Gandalf. You're in... okay, we're back here.

79
00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:10,789
Gandalf takes the curious map. Thorin enters. Follow Gandalf. Gandalf takes... okay, talk to

80
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:23,820
Gandalf. You talk to Gandalf. Gandalf says, fascinating, but I wonder what I could use it for.

81
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:46,870
Thorin says, hurry up. What is he? What? Use map. Northeast. Go northeast. I'm not going to

82
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,990
kill Gandalf. Here we go. You are on the almost hidden path through the trees.

83
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,039
On the ground are many trolls footprints. To the north there is the heavy rock door.

84
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:12,629
Visible exits are south. You see nothing. Just want to make sure he's still here. Oh no,

85
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:23,860
Gandalf's not here anymore. Let's go north. You cannot go north. The heavy rock door,

86
00:14:23,860 --> 00:15:13,080
south. I can't do anything. Talk to Thorin. You talk to Thorin. Where? Hi. What? I do not

87
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:23,509
know the word. It's. What happened to the word 20? You wait. Time passes. I don't know. What do

88
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:32,809
we do? What happens in the first part of the movie? What happens in The Hobbit? I try to

89
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:49,210
open the door. The door is locked. All right, south. You are in a small clearing, half hidden

90
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:56,470
amongst the trees. Yes, yes, yes. A hideous troll. Uh oh. You can go southwest, southeast,

91
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,110
or north. You can see a hideous troll. A troll is carrying the large key and a vicious

92
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:09,419
troll. Thorin enters. A hideous troll says blimey, look at this. Can you cook them? Yeah,

93
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:16,039
I could try, but they wouldn't make a bovver mouthful. Thorin remarks to you. Well, thief,

94
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,799
you don't seem to be making a very good beginning to this adventure. I hope you

95
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:25,799
have some idea how to get us out of this mess. You wait. Time passes. The hideous troll

96
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:35,620
eats you. His foul gluttony has killed a hideous troll. You are dead. I was too slow?

97
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:53,820
Did I have to go faster than that? I was reading the text. I guess I had to just go

98
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:03,220
immediately. All right, one last try. Try it again. Okay, we're gonna go follow Gandalf.

99
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:13,299
What do you mean I can't follow Gandalf from here? Oh, Gandalf hasn't left.

100
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,769
Okay, it's map drawn. Gandalf opens the round door. We're gonna go follow,

101
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:39,049
follow Gandalf. I'm just, I'm doing my slash following. Go east. Close the door.

102
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:47,450
All right, Gandalf enters. Okay, we're east. You can go east, north, or northeast. Let's go

103
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,599
northeast. I gotta hurry up, though, because you don't have to look. This is the hidden path.

104
00:17:52,599 --> 00:18:03,029
No, let's go back. Wait, did I go, go, go south? All right, here's the trolls. Here we go.

105
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:19,099
Here we go. Ready? Go, uh, go north. No, no, no, go south. Go, um, hide. Hide. Run. Made it.

106
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:30,170
You're on a good path at the brink of a fast flowing river. All right, here we go.

107
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:39,880
Behind a narrow bridge of stone, without a parapet, crosses the river. Ahead, you can see the last

108
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,579
homely house. You can go east and west. You can see Elrond. Hey, hey, Elrond. You wait time,

109
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:48,460
but Doron, with a fair way looking at us, starts muttering about gold and treasure. Elrond

110
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:55,210
gives him lunch. Eat. You eat some lunch. Doron says, hurry up. Day dawns. What? Um,

111
00:18:56,329 --> 00:19:06,039
um, inquire about the ring. I don't know. Leave. Exit. Go north? Hello? Hello? You,

112
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:11,720
hello? Time passes. Doron starts singing about gold. Elrond gives some lunch to you. Eat

113
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:26,329
lunch. You eat some lunch. It was delicious. Talk to Elrond. You talk to Elrond. Doron waits.

114
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:43,539
There's nothing to eat. Okay, let's leave. Go north. You cannot go north. Hurry up. What

115
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:51,619
are we hurrying for? I can't talk to. Go west. You go west. The trolls clearing.

116
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:58,569
Visible exits are south, west, south, east, north. You can see Gandalf. Ooh, the large

117
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:02,009
key. Gandalf takes the large key. Thorin enters. You wait. Time passes. Gandalf says,

118
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:08,630
what's this? I wonder. Take key. Gandalf is carrying the key. Talk to Gandalf.

119
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,519
Gandalf gives the large key to you. Well, are we going to just stand here all day? All

120
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:23,450
right. Uh, go to the, what was the heavy door? South. Go south. You cannot go south. Go

121
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:38,779
north. Go northeast. Follow Gandalf. Um, leave. You leave. Time passes. Gandalf

122
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:45,799
goes southeast. Go southeast. Rivendell. Visible exits are east, west. You can see

123
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,480
Gandalf and Elrond. Gandalf goes east. Thorin enters. Elrond says hello. Yes,

124
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,569
hello. You see hello. Time passes. Elrond gives some lunch to you. I guess I'll

125
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,430
eat. You eat some lunch. Thorin says, well, are we going to just stand here all day? Go

126
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:13,990
east. You are on a hard, dangerous path in the Misty Mountains. The path is marked with

127
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,950
white stones, of which many are small and others are half covered with amazes or heather.

128
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,049
You can go east, northwest. You can go any direction. Where's Gandalf? Thorin sits down

129
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:28,569
and starts singing about gold. The mean goblin enters. Go Gandalf. Go Gandalf. Go north. Go

130
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:35,369
north. Go north. You are on a narrow path at the top of the valley, which opens suddenly

131
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:43,529
at your feet. You are on a narrow path at the top of the valley, which opens suddenly at your

132
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,769
feet. At the bottom of the valley, trees can be seen poking above the mist, and the sound

133
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:54,329
of running water can be heard. You can go east, north, south. You see dead Gandalf.

134
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:13,900
Attack. Attack. Attack goblin. Who killed Gandalf? Attack troll. The mean goblin

135
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:21,430
captures you. It is too dark to see anything. Did Gandalf fall off the mountain? Oh, this is so

136
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:28,950
stupid. Run. But you go somewhere. But in the dark, you stumble and fall heavily to the ground.

137
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:47,910
It is too dark to see anything. Hide. Um, uh, pray. Struggle. Go east. In the dark, light.

138
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:58,630
Use light. Light. You light. Time passes. Thorin appears. Thorin, to you. Thorin asks,

139
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,390
would it perchance be too much trouble to inquire as to your plans for getting us out of here,

140
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,190
or are we just going to sit around it all day in this dungeon? Time passes. You hear a noise.

141
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:18,259
You wait. Time passes. You hear a noise. It's too dark to see anything.

142
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:34,900
Listen. I don't know the word listen. Um, walk. Smell. Run. You stumble and fall heavily

143
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:55,799
to the ground. It is too dark to see. You hear a noise. You hear a noise. Again. Uh,

144
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:03,740
it's too dark to see anything. You hear a distant vroom. How long are we going to be in here for?

145
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:09,559
Just eat? Nothing to eat. How long are we going to be just sitting here for? Follow.

146
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:26,730
Follow noise. Go noise. Noise. Talk to Thorin. I see nothing here. What are you talking about?

147
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:40,099
Talk. Like it's too dark to talk. I can't, it's too dark to talk. Call out. Yell. Just keep,

148
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:50,250
I'm just going to keep running. Run. Run. I just keep falling down. Run. I'm just running

149
00:24:50,250 --> 00:25:02,220
into walls back and forth. Um, use the light, but they don't know the word use. I mean light.

150
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:16,730
You light. Time passes. Run. It's too dark. But what, you light. Take the ring.

151
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,900
You follow no, but you can't follow the noise because it's too dark and he doesn't,

152
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:31,559
they don't know what the word noise is. Lantern. Inventory. I can't see my inventory.

153
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:48,920
How dark is it in here? Wear ring. Ring. What? Open eyes. Oh, what? I finally had,

154
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,799
just kept my eyes open this whole time. It would have been so much easier. Equip ring.

155
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:10,140
I don't know what that word means. Hear. Noise. What? You do know what the word

156
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:16,859
noise is. You just wrote it. You just wrote the word noise. Listen doesn't,

157
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:28,569
I just already tried that. I don't know what the word listen means. Status. Um, feel.

158
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:37,940
I don't know what that word is. Uh, light torch. You light. Time passes. You hear a noise.

159
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:54,869
Break. Climb. Close. Dig. Dig. Untie. Untie. Why don't I read how to play? Sorry,

160
00:26:54,869 --> 00:27:05,130
I didn't read the game manual before we picked a random DOS game. I don't know the word pants.

161
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,740
What? A window should be no obstacle to a thief with friends.

162
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:40,700
Window. Look. Where's Thorin? Thorin. Stand on my shoulders. Stand.

163
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:48,230
Stand up on my shoulders. Climb. Thorin. You cannot climb into Thorin.

164
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:58,940
Look. Window. You can't climb in to Thorin. No, I don't think I would like to either, so.

165
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:12,490
Yeah, when I say talk Thorin, I can't talk to Thorin. Apparently we cannot talk.

166
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:42,019
You sleep. I think I'm just dead. I don't know how to die. Drink. Empty. Enter. Enter.

167
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:50,940
Enter window. You cannot. You cannot enter the window. Break window. It's too dark to see.

168
00:28:50,940 --> 00:29:25,740
I just lit. Open window. I can't. Smash. Light. It doesn't do anything, guys.

169
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,079
You light. Time passes. You hear a noise. Look. It's too dark to see anything. Did you just

170
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:42,420
know? All right, it's. I'm out. I'm out. Yeah, listen to noise. I don't know what

171
00:29:42,420 --> 00:30:08,019
listening is. I don't know what the word noise is. I need to light something. No. Hear sound.

172
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:17,849
No, it doesn't know anything. Light sound. All right, I'm out. I'm out. I'm stuck here forever.

173
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:24,549
I can't search because there is no. Look at. How many times do we have to do this?

174
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:43,880
I'm not going to sit there anymore. We did every single word and it didn't know half of

175
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:52,019
them. We were on that one for like 20 minutes. That's enough time. All right, we're back here.

176
00:30:52,019 --> 00:31:05,539
Where? No, we're not. We should be back. Where's the hobbit? Right there. No, we were like here.

177
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:12,839
Yeah, we were. Like right here. Right there. Okay, so this is where we were.

178
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,230
That was fucking all over the place. It could be fun though. All right, give it a click.

179
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:39,539
Where are we going next? Light self. Why can I not see the clicks? Oh, that's why. Okay,

180
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,549
looks like we got a lot of people that are clicking on the

181
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:56,410
president one. I think that's going to win by what I would just determine this to be a landslide.

182
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:15,180
Here comes a politics stream. Sort of. Maybe. All right, so we're going to call it there.

183
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:29,400
We're going to president-elect. Thank you for voting. President-elect 1988 edition.

184
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:45,269
Interesting. 1988. I wonder if the sound on this one. Okay, this is the president-elect

185
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:53,700
1988 by Nelson. 2.1 copyright. IBM PC version and graphics designed by CHO. Begin new simulation.

186
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:05,529
Continue old simulation. We had $50 just came in right now. That was from Alexander Gabriel.

187
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:19,400
Thanks to the $50 and two cents. 5,000 bits. We got our first campaign donation. Oh, I gotta

188
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,940
turn on. Yeah, hold on. I still have the click. You can still click the click map.

189
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:32,230
There we go. But thank you so much to Alexander Gabriel. And they say here's to you,

190
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,269
Jerma, for being here for all through my high school experience. Just graduated on Thursday

191
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:42,779
and I'm so happy to be out of high school now. I'm going to become an electrician now,

192
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:47,269
so I can give you more money. Jerma Hart. Oh, you don't have to work to give me money.

193
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:56,009
But congratulations on the graduating high school. And hell yeah. I wish you luck. I wish

194
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:04,490
you the best in your future career. Thank you so much for the $50. Hell yeah. Cheers to that.

195
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:15,699
All right. So we're going to begin new simulation. Choose map colors. Red, green,

196
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:28,199
brown, cyan, magenta, or white. I mean red. Let's do RG. RGB. Except that's what? Press enter

197
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:39,340
to begin. 5, 1, 17. What's going on? Red, green, brown. RGB is blue. What? What am I

198
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:51,849
doing? And what's this 1, 5, and 17? Okay. Pick your year. Oh, this is what happened.

199
00:34:51,849 --> 00:35:04,280
Third party. Okay. 1988. What is the last name of the Democratic candidate? Candidate not found.

200
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:11,980
Try again or rate candidate. Wait, I have to pick somebody that was actually a Democrat

201
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:26,059
in 1988? For the following series of issues in question, stats. Raise taxes to balance budget.

202
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:31,420
What is it going? Wait, hold on. For the following series of issues in question,

203
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,670
state the candidate's support or agreement on this scale. Oppose, disagree very strongly.

204
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:44,860
Okay. All right. Raise taxes to balance budget. What would Gandalf say? Oh, boy.

205
00:35:49,880 --> 00:36:08,860
All right. I know how to do this. Ready? You guys can't even see my answers. All right.

206
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:15,050
Rate the candidate's poise. Under intense pressure. Frequently puts foot in mouth.

207
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,690
Sometimes slips, but not often. Extremely cool under fire. That's Gandalf. What state

208
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:27,960
is the candidate from? Middle Earth. Is there an M-E? Yep. What state is the vice president from?

209
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,219
Also from Middle Earth. What is the last name of the Republican candidate?

210
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,340
No, I can't do that because that's like, that's making it evil.

211
00:36:53,260 --> 00:37:14,500
I don't know. Fucking Homer Simpson. Candidate's personal magnetism. Ease to ignore.

212
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:21,059
Average for... pretty average. Rate the candidate's poise. Yeah, sometimes you have an issue. What

213
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:25,219
state is the candidate from? What's Springfield, Ohio? No, they've never said it. They've never

214
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:37,019
said it ever in the whole entire run of the whole show. Just not Illinois. Vice president is

215
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:42,250
gonna be, I don't know, gonna be Marge? What is the last name of the third party candidate?

216
00:37:42,250 --> 00:38:01,500
Oh my god. No, it's me. Let's get that candidate. How do you feel about all the...

217
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:11,190
Rate candidate's speaking ability. I mean, we're talking about like an orator for the ages.

218
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,739
Rate candidate's personal magnetism. A spellbinder. Absolutely irresistible.

219
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:23,300
Candidate's poise. Extremely cool under fire. Frequently puts foot in dog. What state is the

220
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,889
candidate from? Well, what do you like? M-A. What state is the vice president? Vice president

221
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:41,849
is gonna be... who's vice president? Otto. Okay, so he's also from M-A. Which party has

222
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:48,039
been in power for the last four years? Well, let's just go for like realism here.

223
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,400
Is Homer Simpson the incumbent? Yes. What has the rate of inflation been for the past year?

224
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:05,880
I don't know. Five? Six percent? Is it a percent? It's six.

225
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,760
That would be catastrophic. The party and office would certainly be thrown out.

226
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:28,090
Yeah, if Homer Simpson was the president, we're into something more reasonable.

227
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:37,380
All right. Something high. Like 16%. That's fucking crazy. What is the latest unemployment

228
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:44,820
figure? Well, if Homer Simpson's the president, let's say 94%. That would be catastrophic.

229
00:39:45,460 --> 00:40:05,269
All right. Reasonable. I don't know. What's like... 68%. 50%. 49%. 45%. 30%. 29%. 28%.

230
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:12,820
20%. Okay, all right. So what is the current rate of GNP growth adjusted for inflation?

231
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:26,019
Is the nation at peace or at war? We're at war. On a scale of one to nine, how would you

232
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:41,639
describe the popularity of the war among the voters? I don't know. We're living in fucking hell

233
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:51,619
right now. This is actual hell. World War II? I don't know. Will Gandalf be managed by the

234
00:40:51,619 --> 00:41:01,460
computer? Yes. Will Homer Simpson be managed by the computer? Yes. Will German NA-5 be managed

235
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:12,619
by the computer? No. Okay, here we go. As of the last week, national polls reported the

236
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:19,019
following average projections. Gandalf with 38% with 320 electoral votes. Homer Simpson with

237
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:26,860
30% and 81 electoral votes. And German NA-5 with 32% of the popular vote but only 13 electoral

238
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,980
colleges. Too close to call. There are 530 electoral votes of which 270 are needed to

239
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:43,590
win. What do you mean that's too close to call? Oh, I see. Gandalf won already. Gandalf

240
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:54,820
leaning. All right, who's leaning Gandalf? Who's leaning me? Only my home state. That's it.

241
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:07,780
Massachusetts is leaning me. Homer Simpson's got like the middle of America here. Gandalf.

242
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:17,539
Okay, Nevada is leaning Homer Simpson. All right, let's go. Ready to begin campaigning

243
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:21,139
for the week of September 1st to the 7th? Starting week one. Eight weeks to go. All

244
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:27,059
right, let's go. Economic news. Economic indicators during the last month showed a

245
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:32,630
modest weakening from the previous month. Foreign news. Slightly favorable. At this time,

246
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,550
all campaign staffs must decide whether or not their candidate will visit a foreign country

247
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:42,389
during the campaign. Gandalf has decided to send the vice president to a friendly country

248
00:42:42,389 --> 00:42:48,090
during week four. The trip will last six days. Homer Simpson has decided not to take the trip.

249
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:57,960
To the German NA-5 staff, do you want to take the trip? He sent Frodo to Mordor. Sure,

250
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:04,250
to a friendly neutral or unfriendly country. Unfriendly. Send vice president or presidential

251
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:12,380
candidate. Send the vice president. Let's send Otto. During which week? One first week. For how

252
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:22,889
many days? Cost in PAP 500 plus 50. Uh two days. On a scale of one to 100, indicate the

253
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:27,130
quality of German NA-5's organization. The best would be 100. Anything under 75 might be

254
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:36,329
unwise. I told you I'm a B plus streamer. What's my social? What? No, no, no, no, no,

255
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:42,900
what's my social blade at right now? Somebody go check. What is my stream twitch social blade?

256
00:43:42,900 --> 00:44:01,659
What is it? I think it's a B plus. There it is right there. B plus. Done. Wait, wait, wait,

257
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:09,000
wait, wait, it just skipped. What is it? Why did it skip? I think a concrete car

258
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:16,969
for the five community subs. Thank you concrete. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

259
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:21,769
Five subs coming in here. Coming in hot. All right, here we go. I gotta make some

260
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:27,210
choices here. Political action points. I have 16,000 this week's overhead. All right,

261
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:33,610
political points. National campaigning covers entire nation. States with more electoral votes

262
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:41,030
will receive proportionately more coverage. How much should I spend on nation coverage?

263
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:53,289
To 2,240? So I should go all in on the first week? That's probably a bad idea.

264
00:44:53,289 --> 00:45:03,500
All right, here we go. New England. Gandalf, Homer Simpson, and me. I got Massachusetts.

265
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:10,650
I'm close, pretty close to Connecticut. I'm close in Rhode Island. I'm losing in Maine.

266
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:17,000
Losing, I'm losing, I got Vermont. Homer Simpson is not in this part of the country.

267
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:29,260
Mid-Atlantic. I'm not winning in any of these. Why is Gandalf so popular?

268
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:41,780
In the South. Nobody likes me down South. Holy shit. I have no fans down South.

269
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:52,230
Everybody loves Gandalf around the whole country. 15 community subs just came in from

270
00:45:52,789 --> 00:46:01,429
Ampharic. Thank you. That's a lot. Big 15 sub drop here. Thank you so much.

271
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:09,860
Congratulations to all the people that just got the subs. 15 of them just came in.

272
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:19,349
Thank you so much Ampharic. I have no fans though. Wisconsin, but Gandalf is winning

273
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:26,980
everything. How do we smear campaign Gandalf? I got it. You went into the middle of nowhere

274
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:32,119
to get a couple of hobbits to go do a fucking mission for you. You couldn't just do it

275
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:43,179
yourself. They were children by the way. Homer Simpson's got Missouri. I got Oklahoma though.

276
00:46:43,179 --> 00:47:05,219
Those Oklahomans. New Mexico, close. Nevada. Great state of Nevada, close. California.

277
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:10,019
Californians love Gandalf. Not going to be able to do anything.

278
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:16,599
Gandalf refuses to debate. Homer Simpson is calling for a debate anytime, anywhere. Does

279
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:23,019
German 985 wish to debate? Yes I do. Do Homer Simpson and German 985 agree to a debate at

280
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:26,780
this time? Of course we do. The candidates have agreed that Gandalf's going to go do his own

281
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:32,219
thing. How many questions will be asked during this debate? I'll get them all. I'll knock

282
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:37,989
them all out of the park. The candidates are ready to begin. By the luck of the draw,

283
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:42,469
candidate Homer Simpson will answer first. Other candidates will then alternate on subsequent

284
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:49,719
questions. Question directed to Homer Simpson. What is your position on the current military

285
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:56,090
budget? Are there any areas you believe that need to be cut or increased? And to the percent

286
00:47:56,090 --> 00:48:06,230
of time the candidate will allocate to each line of argument? What? Hold on. So he four

287
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:13,699
percent discussed irrelevant considerations, spent half the time stating his own position, spent

288
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:21,880
90% of the time contrasting position with me, killing time 12%, and then attacking opponent's

289
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:28,380
position 15%. What is your position on the current military budget? Are there any areas

290
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:53,320
you believe that need to be cut or increased? Turn to speak, Homer Simpson! 41% emphasis,

291
00:48:53,320 --> 00:49:00,199
clarity on their own positions. No criticizing with, uh, witticisms. Spend a little bit of

292
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:07,590
time killing time, implying opponent is uninformed. Criticize with moral indignation,

293
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:28,760
okay? My turn. That was just a, you're wrong. How should the United States deal with illegal

294
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:44,679
immigration? How should the United States deal with, okay, kill time! Homer Simpson did the

295
00:49:44,679 --> 00:50:02,789
same thing. So both candidates don't want to do that. Okay, uh, my turn. Let's clarify our

296
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:12,820
position a little bit here. Let me clarify, and then I'm gonna give 10% here, 30% here,

297
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:18,300
I'm gonna criticize with some, uh, I guess, uh, what's, was this a new question? We're gonna

298
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,219
imply that, not imply at all that they're uninformed, but we're gonna do some moving

299
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:30,730
around. 30, 10, 30, 30. Well, fuck, he, I got him against the ropes. Uh, Dark Soul,

300
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,969
thanks for the five community subs. Dark Soul 115. That's a lot of subs tonight, yeah.

301
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:42,489
So Homer is, is doing like the joke I did in the very beginning. He's fucked. He's just

302
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:47,210
killing time. His, like, eyes are darting back and forth. Um, uh, uh, don't, oh!

303
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,050
And then everyone laughs and he gets, like, the votes back.

304
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:54,179
Are you in support of affirmative actions and programs as a means of bringing minorities

305
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:59,260
and women into the mainstream of the American economy? Uh, okay, yeah. So,

306
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:08,389
enter the percent of time. Uh, let's discuss relevant considerations. Let's give that about,

307
00:51:08,389 --> 00:51:13,989
let's give that, uh, let's give that, like, 30%. We'll go with the 25% here.

308
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:19,960
Uh, contrast position with opponents. I'm gonna give that, um, I'm gonna give that 10%. I'm

309
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:29,000
gonna go with, like, 40% here. Oh, fuck. I went over. How do I go? I don't go back. I went over.

310
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,440
Can I do minus five? Zero? I did 105%.

311
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:59,460
Canada tried to exceed time on that last reply and had to be cut off.

312
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,460
Time has been redistributed so the sum of all five lines does equal 100%.

313
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:12,099
Homer Simpson, he's not, he's just killing time. 40% emphasis on your own position.

314
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:22,090
41 kill time. I, you are fucked. Oh, and now you're just killing time. Let me give you a 20,

315
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:29,690
let me give you a 30% on my position. Here you go. 40% on criticizing you. Don't need to do

316
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:35,750
that one. And then, uh, incredibly uninformed. Let's go 30% here. Not gonna kill any time.

317
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,110
Right now, I'm, I got them. I'm like, I'm, I'm beating them in, in, like, in, like, this,

318
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:52,219
like, uh, Muhammad Ali did. What? German 95 has committed a gaffe. The questionnaires are

319
00:52:52,219 --> 00:53:02,679
looking at each other in amazement. What was the gaffe? What did I do? Am I miked up right now?

320
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:08,070
Did they hear what I was saying? Are you in favor of tariffs of a means of protecting domestic

321
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:23,429
industries? Fucking gaffe. He gaffed. How did I gaffe? State-owned position. 10%. Contrast

322
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:27,960
position with opponents. 10%. I'm gonna, I'm gonna back off here. Let's go with, like,

323
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,880
8% and then, like, four. We're gonna, I'm backing off. I'm just gonna kill some time.

324
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:49,190
I'm gonna get my breath. Don't be a gaffe. All right. Are you in favor of tariffs as

325
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:54,710
a means of protecting domestic industries? Um, that's a pretty good question for Homer Simpson.

326
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:58,230
He didn't really dodge it. I did. Just, I wanted to back off a little bit. I just had a big gaffe.

327
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:08,019
I'm gonna clarify. I'm gonna go, like, 58%. No. Round numbers because I'm stupid. We're

328
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:13,769
gonna do 60% emphasis clarifying my position. I backed off a little. I don't need very much

329
00:54:13,769 --> 00:54:18,659
criticisms here. I'm not gonna imply that they're uninformed. Maybe 5%. And then we'll

330
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:28,820
kill a little bit of time. We'll just kill, we'll kill a little bit. See? 50%. And now,

331
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:36,579
hold on a minute. Let me clarify. Excuse me. What measures would you take to correct the

332
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:46,679
adverse trends in our balance of trade? He had a lot of responses here. 18% discussed

333
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:52,550
relevant considerations. 39, 36. So he wants to know, he's contrasting his positions with mine.

334
00:54:53,699 --> 00:55:00,579
I'm going after him here. Yeah, I'm going after him. 20%. Give you a pin. Okay. 30, 20. 20%, 20%.

335
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:10,500
40%. No, no, no, no, no. 10%. And then 50%. I'm going after him.

336
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:20,119
Derma has committed a serious gaffe. The panel is aghast. How unfortunate.

337
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:27,909
What do I keep doing? What am I doing?

338
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:43,139
62% clarifying. 22, criticize morally, kill time. What, you're not gonna make any gaffes

339
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:51,900
with like 60%? I'm clarifying everything now. Clarify. Clarify. Clarify. Clarify.

340
00:55:52,460 --> 00:56:06,420
What about your policy on nuclear power? Um, I don't know. I'm not gonna, I'm not getting

341
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:11,349
into the gaffe. Discuss relevant, let's talk about the relevancy of nuclear. State your

342
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:15,349
own position on nuclear. Let's go with like, let's go with like 45%. Like,

343
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:19,539
let's state my own position. I'm gonna be clear here. Not gonna con, maybe a little bit

344
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:25,539
of contrasting. Not gonna like attack very much. Maybe like 5%. No, no, no. Like 5%. And then

345
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:28,739
we'll spend 20% just kind of moving around and doing some anecdotes. I wanna be, I need

346
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:35,849
to start clearing up my, my shit here. Yeah. See, they did the same thing. My turn. All

347
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:38,809
right. Clarify my position. Again, we're gonna go hard here. No, no, no. We're gonna

348
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:44,809
go like 45. Uh, we're gonna go like 15 with some criticisms. Another like 15. I'm gonna

349
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:48,809
criticize. I'm not gonna imply that they're uninformed and we're gonna kill a little bit

350
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:56,550
more time here. Mmm. Besides my serious gaffes, I've got them against the ropes.

351
00:56:57,699 --> 00:57:08,179
In the opinion of the press, the debate went as follows. Homer Simpson, 17, 16,

352
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:31,019
German 95, 9, and 2. Nobody else. I just have Massachusetts. Nobody else likes me.

353
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:43,340
God damn it. Uh, begin campaigning. Starting week two. Questionable statements. Homer Simpson

354
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:50,150
had a questionable statement. What'd he do? German 95's running mate was abroad for two

355
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:56,309
days last week and receiving mixed reviews. Campaign officials are accepting this philosophically,

356
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:59,909
but in any event, it appears the trip will have very little impact on the campaign.

357
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:06,090
It's because Otto's a dog and he just walked around and looked cute. I'm gonna do 2000.

358
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:12,730
Save some of these points. Covers all states in a region with uh spending. All right. New

359
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:17,300
England. I'm going all in in New England because it's the only place that they like me.

360
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:35,530
Mid-Atlantic, 250. The South, 300. Industrial Midwest, 200. Mid-West, 400. West, 450.

361
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:49,369
Pacific coast. Uh, 400. Oh, this has to be 2000. I thought, no, no, no. I thought this was like

362
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:55,739
a scale of how you want. I didn't know it was like literal. So I have 62.

363
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:17,190
What the fuck? 15, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 35,

364
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:25,449
and then I want. Dermot gave my phone a virus. I did not do that. You were downloading something.

365
00:59:25,449 --> 00:59:31,800
You were downloading something and you got caught with a virus. I didn't do it.

366
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:37,000
Literally a worse politician than Homer Simpson. No, I'm not. I'm not a worse politician.

367
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:50,329
We're gonna do 20. I want, I want the Pacific coast is mine. I get 15. That's,

368
00:59:50,329 --> 01:00:03,349
I can do 17. I feel like I want to just fail this because I don't want whatever. All

369
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:14,519
right. I went up in Massachusetts. 140. Gandalf is losing the mid-Atlantic

370
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:22,329
in favor of Homer Simpson. No, the south there, down south. They're really just,

371
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:28,760
it's too far out of reach. And I'm a fucking third party candidate. I just, by default,

372
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:35,300
get like 5% of the vote. That's what's going on here. It's going up in all these other

373
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:48,500
states. No, none of them. I'm not going to win. Ooh, wait a minute. California. Hold on.

374
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:54,599
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. California is huge. California is like the most important.

375
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:03,610
It's like the biggest one. Holy shit. I might win if I do this right. And I got Hawaii

376
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:11,130
and I got Oregon and I got Washington. I got the whole Pacific coast. Gandalf refuses to,

377
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:15,960
no, I'm not debating. I don't want to debate anybody. I'm not gonna have any more serious

378
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:27,429
gaffes. Gandalf. All right. I've got 13 there. All right. Anybody leaning towards my way?

379
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:42,889
Yes, let's go. Okay. The latest monthly consumer price index showed an increase of 1.7%. The

380
01:01:42,889 --> 01:01:49,210
rate of inflation for the past six months is now 17.7%. Somewhat unfavorable news.

381
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:59,400
I would think so. Okay. National campaigning. Cover his entire nation. States will,

382
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:08,889
yeah, yeah, yeah. Not to spend. I want to spend it all. 1867. Go all in. Massachusetts

383
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:23,619
got it locked in except Homer Simpson. Fuck off. I got Maine. I got Jersey. I got Maryland.

384
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:35,820
I'm tied with Delaware. So how come we go to the map? Why do I only have Massachusetts?

385
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:42,230
80, Florida. No. 43, 52. No. When we get to the industrial Midwest, I lose everything.

386
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:50,650
I'm not going to get it. The Midwest is a toss up here. I got Kansas. The West.

387
01:02:51,369 --> 01:03:04,360
Homer Simpson's got Nevada. Pacific Coast. I lost it again. Gandalf. I'm going to go to,

388
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:13,050
no, no, no. I have to debate. I get to debate next week. God damn it. How do I get another

389
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:24,969
state? Third party is hard mode. Yeah. Why did I do third party? Unemployment was 20%.

390
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:34,980
All right. Let's debate. I'm going for it. 1661. I'm spending all my money, but

391
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:48,219
I got to get a debate in here. I have to win some points. My only hope is California Hail Mary.

392
01:03:51,239 --> 01:04:00,820
No. Gandalf is locking it in. Let's go. Debate. Let's go. How many questions

393
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:08,500
would there be? Let's do three questions. Homer Simpson will answer first. Do you

394
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,340
intend to follow an environmental policy that will be more or less restrictive on business?

395
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:19,780
Homer Simpson says he's going to state his side and he's going to contrast it with mine.

396
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:27,429
So we have a very different opinion, apparently. We're going to go 20%. I'm going to state 30% my

397
01:04:27,429 --> 01:04:33,030
opinions, contrast it about 25%. I'm going to say your policies are a little, a little weird.

398
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,429
I don't know. I don't like your policies. I'm going to go just kill time.

399
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:41,579
That's pretty balanced. Now he's clarifying his position and he's killing time.

400
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:48,360
He's not criticizing me, which means he knows he's wrong. Okay. So I'm going to,

401
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,159
I'm going to clarify mine again and then we're going to criticize.

402
01:04:51,880 --> 01:05:03,050
So let's, let's get a real good, like 35% clarification. 10% here, 25% here.

403
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:06,969
Let's, you're a little bit uninformed on this 15% here and then we'll do a little bit of time

404
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:27,639
killing. I think that's pretty good. What did I do? What, how is this a gaffe? What did I

405
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:42,119
gaffe? You, you kept Clara, I didn't wear pants to the debate. Yeah, I'm at the podium

406
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:46,440
and that's why I think our environment is incredibly important to protect. Like cheering,

407
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,079
cheering. Yeah. I think that we need to be very, very careful with how we do and deal

408
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:55,500
with new industries. And I take a little step to the side, right of the podium.

409
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,380
And I also believe I don't have any pants on. Oh, what the, I think that we need to be

410
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:08,619
on point here with every part of our environmental lifestyles. And I looked down

411
01:06:08,619 --> 01:06:11,980
and I'm like, what the, and I like put both hands down like that's going to help

412
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:14,699
like covering me. Oh, I'm like covering, even though that doesn't do anything.

413
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:20,300
And like I tilt my knees in, then I go back like right, left, left, left, left, left, left,

414
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:38,699
over to the podium. All right. Am I in favor of changes? Discuss relevant considerations.

415
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:54,579
And now let's, let's go contrast and then attack and then we'll kill some time.

416
01:06:54,579 --> 01:07:01,449
I'm contrasting, I'm attacking. This is a gaffe. Okay. So now he has to stay

417
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:13,960
at his own positions and he's killing time. So I should now, I should now criticize,

418
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:20,070
or I should imply that they're uninformed because like, oh yeah, you're just wrong.

419
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,469
Everything you just said was wrong. And I've already clarified mine and you,

420
01:07:22,469 --> 01:07:29,050
you just spent that time clarified. So you're wrong. Let's go with,

421
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:38,760
I already did this like 15% emphasis. I wouldn't, I'm not going to criticize.

422
01:07:40,539 --> 01:07:55,420
Let's go with like 5%, 5%. Implied that they're uninformed. 50%. Like, no, that's,

423
01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:03,099
is that going to be a gaffe? 40% and then we'll just kill around. That's a lot of time killing

424
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:19,100
though. That's too much time killing. No, it wasn't. Okay. Clarifying. He's saying that

425
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:24,539
I'm uninformed and he's killing time. All right. Well, I think I've won that one.

426
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,340
No gaffe. And I look at, look at how fucked up he is right here.

427
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:33,350
What thoughts do you have on the situation in South Africa and to what degree should

428
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:41,159
we press our objections? He's like, I don't know. I don't know. I should just run over

429
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:44,039
there and just shove him because he didn't take a step to his left. He's got, he's

430
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:49,369
naked too. I'm the only one that can see that. So I'm, you know, I should do it.

431
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:57,689
All right. So now I'm going to say, discuss relevant considerations, state my positions,

432
01:08:58,329 --> 01:09:08,520
bang, contrast positions with opponents and attack. Watch this one. Ready? 25%.

433
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:15,880
Contrast. We're going to go to, let's see, 25% state my opinions. I want these to,

434
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,319
at least one of these has to be big. Attack opponent's position probably has to be,

435
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:37,130
I'm trying to think of like points wise, probably 30, 30, 30, 10 or 30, 40, 0. Oh,

436
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:49,989
no. God damn it. I forgot I did 20 on the one, the first one, the one before. God damn it.

437
01:09:49,989 --> 01:10:00,710
Whatever. I got my point across. See, he's fucked up anyways. Now he's going to clarify

438
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:04,539
and he's implying that I'm informed and you kill in time. Okay. Well,

439
01:10:06,659 --> 01:10:15,640
now we don't have a shirt on. Clarify own positions. That was an actual gaffe.

440
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:28,859
I thought I did like 10 for some reason. I was just going too fast. Strip debating.

441
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:45,670
All right. I'm going to, I'm not going to criticize. I'm going to maybe morals. We'll do 10,

442
01:10:47,689 --> 01:10:55,369
10 and then we'll do like 60 or 50 and then 20 or 40. Yeah. Well, no, no, no, 40 and 30.

443
01:10:56,170 --> 01:11:02,039
This is not going to be a gaffe. I came fucking close to on the points. God damn it.

444
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:23,109
What's this intangibles bullshit? How a 20 to six fucking playing on third party mode.

445
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:27,529
I should have just picked like the Democrat. I would have gotten free points. I should have

446
01:11:27,529 --> 01:11:32,939
picked Republican. I would have got like free points already. I'm starting with my ass against

447
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:45,079
the wall. Gandalf's running mate was abroad for six days last week and received good press.

448
01:11:45,720 --> 01:12:02,279
They're very pleased. I'm almost out of money too. I have to go. I mean, I'm not going to

449
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:16,229
win. It's not possible. I'm not going to win. There's no way I can win. Why are these all

450
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:27,289
so close? I got to release a catchy tune. Gandalf always refuses to debate. I seriously

451
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:41,609
should have listened. Oh, I dropped. I have, oh no, my own state left me. They went to Gandalf.

452
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:57,060
I was naked too many times on stage at this point. You drop out, you know, it's like,

453
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:05,539
I concede to my fellow candidates that I wasn't up to the task of running our nation.

454
01:13:05,539 --> 01:13:19,939
Or apparently I got to get one state. Oh, Gandalf says a debate may be possible this week

455
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:27,100
if the staff can agree on a time. Let's all three of us. Do all three candidates agree to

456
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:32,470
debate each other simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. Here comes the big debate. I'm supposed to be

457
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:39,449
dropped out. Only two questions. Homer Simpson always gets to go first by luck of the drop

458
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:52,899
bullshit. He's like stuffing the ballot box. He's, he's stuffing the ballot box. I spoke

459
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:56,260
to Homer Simpson. Do you believe, I think I'm, you know what, because I've already lost,

460
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:01,880
I'm just going to act like a fucking idiot. I'm going to attack everybody and kill time,

461
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:10,680
every question. I've already lost. I'm just up there because I'm rich and I can keep blowing

462
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:17,720
money. I could keep burning money. I have no states. I have no votes. I'm just the other

463
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:22,119
guy that's there being annoying at this point. And I'm, and I'm going to go fully nude.

464
01:14:22,119 --> 01:14:27,689
I'm not going to be embarrassed this time. I'm going to own it. I'm going for it. Here we go.

465
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:33,109
Do you believe our foreign and domestic competitiveness has been hurt by recent

466
01:14:33,109 --> 01:14:37,989
merger and acquisition activity in the private sector? Oh yeah. How about this one? Yeah.

467
01:14:37,989 --> 01:14:45,960
Fucking who gives a shit. State opposition. I'm smoking a cigarette on stage now. Yeah. Who

468
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:55,180
gives a fuck? By the way, he sucks. He's dumb. His TV show went on for way too many seasons

469
01:14:55,180 --> 01:15:02,520
to a point where it's just sad now. Gandalf, do you believe our foreign and domestic

470
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,920
competitiveness has been, you know, like the same question to you?

471
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:10,279
Well, I think that yes, I'll at least state my position on those. Great.

472
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:17,689
Homer Simpson's killing time. No, that's fine. Hey, hey, Gandalf. Hey, Gandalf.

473
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:30,520
Really made that big blunder sending everybody into the, uh, the goblin town,

474
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:44,970
didn't you? That was a real stupid idea. Whoa. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Say it. Say it.

475
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:54,229
Everyone's booing me. Look at this. Look at me. And like they have to fucking sit me down.

476
01:15:55,029 --> 01:16:07,880
I'll sit down. And I'm like kind of freaking everybody up. 16% emphasis.

477
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:16,119
Well, my opponent is really just, I kind of, these circumstances are just a little too much

478
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:21,079
for me to handle. I'm going to just say that we should be more nice to each other.

479
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:27,529
What does your stand on the death penalty? Do you feel our criminal justice system is

480
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:32,739
overly lenient? Well, I think that it's possible we could have two different debates

481
01:16:32,739 --> 01:16:36,180
and figure out what this could be. And I think this, and this is exactly how I believe.

482
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:43,859
Yeah, I think that is, I don't really like this question, but so maybe if you get,

483
01:16:43,859 --> 01:16:51,619
oh yeah, I maybe move on to a new question. I think we should kill them both. Both of these

484
01:16:51,619 --> 01:17:06,949
clowns right now. I've sat for a position. Yeah. Yeah. We're not even real characters.

485
01:17:06,949 --> 01:17:34,920
We're all fictional. I think that you are out of your mind. Legalized method. Emphasizing my

486
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:46,119
current positions. Oliver Simpson is really, really distraught over this one. My opponent

487
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:57,819
doesn't understand, but we're cartoon characters, so we can't die anyways. They used to die in Tom

488
01:17:57,819 --> 01:18:11,779
and Jerry every episode. I love Tom and Jerry. It was my favorite TV show. I especially liked it

489
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:17,579
when they used to hit each other with hammers on the head. When I was a kid, I used to laugh

490
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:36,149
at it. That is 13. I'm probably going to get removed. I'm going to get removed. How did

491
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:49,000
Homer Simpson win again? Unfortunately, it has been, I still got, I got 22% of the popular vote

492
01:18:49,000 --> 01:19:01,140
though. People are still voting for me. Across the country, there's a bunch of just like

493
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:09,189
sickos. Hey, let's vote. Yeah. I like what he's doing up there. I like what he talks

494
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:17,100
shit to Gandalf. I love his position on Tom and Jerry cartoons. Yeah. Fuck the other

495
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:29,479
candidates. All right. Only two weeks to go. We have to see this through. Inflation increased

496
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:42,649
by 2%. That's so bad. Gandalf had a questionable statement, probably because he was talking

497
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:52,939
about me. I don't want to be on stage with that maniac anymore. He's purely uninformed and

498
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:05,859
possibly insane. Oh boy, I dropped out big time here. I know what it's like to deal with

499
01:20:05,859 --> 01:20:14,279
maniacs. Sauron, Saruman, all of them. He reminds me of them when they were younger.

500
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:26,279
He may as well change his name to Smurma because all bad guys names start with an S

501
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:49,619
and end with an O and he should be Smurron. Holy fuck, I'm losing bad. How did Homer Simpson,

502
01:20:49,619 --> 01:20:56,659
this looks like this is just a fucking like you hold down tab in an online game.

503
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:00,979
Homer Simpson just doing too good to a point where like you don't want them in the server

504
01:21:00,979 --> 01:21:07,510
anymore. You know what I mean? You even like hold down tab and you just like got 315 points.

505
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:16,890
Okay, I'm going somewhere else. North Dakota and South Dakota both do not like me at all.

506
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:33,270
Who knows this even bad? It's 408. What happened? Do I wish to debate?

507
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:47,770
Gandalf doesn't want to debate. I'm not debating. This is the last week. One week to go.

508
01:21:49,909 --> 01:21:58,460
Unemployment was 20%. Gaffs committed Homer Simpson. They're like, I've kind of like

509
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:02,300
detonated the space here. Like I said a bunch of crazy shit and now they're like

510
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:06,859
backpedaling, stepping forward, making like gaffs and questionable statements. I'm really

511
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:18,060
like Homer committed a gaff. All right. So I got eight. Yeah, spin it all. Who cares?

512
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:26,680
I'm just doing this for fun. Massachusetts, 120 points. Yeah, I remember when I had

513
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:34,020
Massachusetts. They all thought I was awesome. And then I read in the newspaper I was naked

514
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:51,350
five times on stage. And all those other brutes didn't like it. They all said I should

515
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:59,699
put some clothes on. I said, yeah. During the interview, German 95 was also nude.

516
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:18,729
Why say I should not have to do that? It's Ed Bighead. No, no, you're talking about

517
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:26,550
the other Bighead. Bighead. That's that's Ed Bighead. Bighead's wife was what was

518
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:39,500
Bighead's wife's name? Bev. Yeah, that's Bev Bighead is unwilling to debate at this time.

519
01:23:40,939 --> 01:23:51,109
I'm just going to take the loss and leave. No, I don't want to debate. I'm done. I give up.

520
01:23:52,550 --> 01:24:03,060
I'm not debating anymore. I'm taking the loss. This is the final week. Good news.

521
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:12,250
The economic indicators are up. Yeah, whatever. Spend the last $6.56. Not like I care.

522
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:22,869
Yeah, apparently the people of Maine and Rhode Island also do not care because I have

523
01:24:22,869 --> 01:24:33,109
almost 33% of the vote for this week, polling wise. Here's the final debate. This is the last

524
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:41,460
the presidential debate. Unwilling is why would you be unwilling to? Yeah, let's go.

525
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Let's go. Yeah, the guy that's running everything, the guy that's winning everything.

526
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:54,789
One question, two questions, two questions. Okay, I get to answer first.

527
01:24:58,899 --> 01:25:03,289
What's this? This is interesting. Everyone's kind of sitting in their seats right now

528
01:25:03,289 --> 01:25:14,329
looking in sort of confusion. German985 has come on stage in a suit with styled hair and looks

529
01:25:14,329 --> 01:25:18,250
like he had some work. He had like green teeth last time. Looks like he had some work done on

530
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:24,300
his teeth and he smells considerably better and people are a little concerned about this.

531
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:29,659
He's just normal. He gets the first question. He comes on stage and he's very just relaxed.

532
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:38,140
Uh, uh, we can begin the debate. Now, um, Mr. Albertson, given recent demographic trends,

533
01:25:38,779 --> 01:25:45,340
what is the likelihood of your administration proposing a return to selective service system?

534
01:25:54,180 --> 01:26:04,869
Well, on further positioning and moving my name around and looking at the facts,

535
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:12,250
trying to find out what is real and what isn't and all of us have different things

536
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:20,359
and different opinions that we all care about and decide that is important. And every single day

537
01:26:22,899 --> 01:26:32,699
we come together as a group of not, not this person, this person, but as Americans to gaze

538
01:26:32,699 --> 01:26:39,579
upon the beauty of my body. Oh, God damn it. He ripped his clothes. He fucking depated us.

539
01:26:41,579 --> 01:26:52,970
God damn it. He did it again. Yeah. Get the fucking cops in here. I don't care. Hey,

540
01:26:53,529 --> 01:26:57,289
uh, get off me. I don't care if I fucking lose.

541
01:27:05,819 --> 01:27:16,229
Give it. Get off. I'll rip your head off. I'll kill him. Get him in the car.

542
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:19,979
I'm not, I'm not going down without a fight.

543
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:52,539
So who won? Silence. Gandalf gets the most. Okay. I was hard not to laugh at that

544
01:27:52,539 --> 01:27:56,779
because it said Gandalf seems to have come out the most from this debate.

545
01:28:02,779 --> 01:28:11,029
He probably was like, fuck you. No, I can't say that on TV. Project next date. Okay.

546
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:23,640
So what state is this? Ooh. Holy shit. I got 634,000 votes.

547
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:49,640
Let's just go to the final. Fuck this. Did I get any states? No, I don't think so.

548
01:28:50,359 --> 01:29:02,760
Well, the results are in. Ladies and gentlemen, your newest president of the United States

549
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:23,829
of America. Please welcome to the stage Gandalf. He wins a landslide. That's so fucking

550
01:29:23,829 --> 01:29:38,619
ridiculous. Chairman at five is was last seen being taken to the local penitentiary.

551
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:50,069
He said in the back of the squad car, if you let me just open the door and fall out on the

552
01:29:50,069 --> 01:29:58,520
highway, pretending, and this is a direct quote, pretending that I escaped, I will deposit

553
01:29:59,239 --> 01:30:08,630
a hundred grand into both of your bank accounts. He now awaits trial.

554
01:30:08,630 --> 01:30:28,810
Look at this map. It's like never been a map like this. I think this has happened like twice in

555
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:40,739
history. You got a fully, a fully red, a fully red west and east coast, and the middle is blue.

556
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:58,170
That very, that doesn't ever happen. The color's a flip. No, Homer Simpson was,

557
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:07,180
was the Democrat, wasn't he? Wait, what? No, red, red was, was Homer Republican?

558
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:19,779
Wait, hold on. I get invited to the inauguration? Why would they do blue Republican and red

559
01:31:19,779 --> 01:31:28,890
Democrat? That's been like that for like hundreds of years. All right, I get to go to

560
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:42,180
the inauguration. I'm in like cuffs and like an orange suit. See, president. Oh, there it is.

561
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:47,829
It's time to move on to the next one. It's been like that for millions of years.

562
01:31:49,369 --> 01:32:06,550
That was president-elect 1988 edition. So where to now? Oh, this is incorrect though.

563
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:16,630
This needs to be like this. There we go. So we were down here. You've been invited to the

564
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:30,890
inauguration and with a pair of clothes. So it was down here, right here somewhere, right here.

565
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:42,340
All right, we've got one more from this list. You'll be able to click in just a second.

566
01:32:42,979 --> 01:32:52,699
Here we go. Remember, you have to be able to see the text. I'm not doing leisure suit,

567
01:32:52,699 --> 01:33:15,340
Larry. No, no. Go again. It's not a porn game. It is the original porn game. It's the porn game

568
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:19,180
to create all porn games. It's the one that they based all the other porn games off of.

569
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:23,500
Every porn game that you've played in the last 10 years is because of the porn game that

570
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:44,039
was the leisure suit Larry porn game. Damn it. All right, you ready? Ready for this?

571
01:33:44,039 --> 01:34:04,180
All you guys want your porn games. Stop saying porn game. Well, sorry guys. I can't play it.

572
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:23,239
I tried. I clicked it. I'll try it again. I'll click it one more time. We'll see.

573
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:31,130
Leisure suit Larry. Land of the Lounge Lizards. All right. I'm going to for total transparency.

574
01:34:31,130 --> 01:35:01,609
Look, it actually fucking worked. First sound in an hour and a half. Okay.

575
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:10,060
Oh, leisure suit. Leisure suit Larry in the land of the lounge lizards contain some

576
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:14,460
elements of plot which may not be suitable. They may not be appropriate for children.

577
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:21,720
No, how old are you? Oh, okay. Oh, it's not a porn game. We just have a click,

578
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:29,800
a age verification click thing. It's not a porn game though. Hey, look, I still get to click

579
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:39,960
this one. Yeah, sure you are. To verify your age, please answer the five simple questions.

580
01:35:41,109 --> 01:35:44,710
Ah, who lost a daughter but gained a meathead? I don't fucking know.

581
01:35:45,909 --> 01:35:58,260
I don't know what this is. Which U.S. and there's like boobs back.

582
01:35:58,979 --> 01:36:03,829
Not that this like a shirt on. Which U.S. Secretary of State was born in Germany?

583
01:36:10,569 --> 01:36:16,149
Who was the inventive genius behind the Apple computer? That's Steve Wozniak.

584
01:36:19,529 --> 01:36:27,500
Close encounters of the third kind is about creatures from outer space. Yes.

585
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:36,300
IBM stands for itsy bitsy men. It's international business machines.

586
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:41,380
And now a question that won't tax your memory. This question refers to

587
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:47,159
your documentation that came with your copy of the game. Okay, so we can't play this one.

588
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:54,250
The gal sitting around the campfire is playing a what? This is your one chance.

589
01:36:54,890 --> 01:37:10,409
I ain't, I'm not looking it up. No, I refuse to look this up. Is it B? B, here's your chance.

590
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:23,699
Smart map. Oh, hold on. I can't really get it. Here you go. Smart map. This is your shot.

591
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:44,039
I can't reset it because I have to, I'm stuck in this window. It looks like it's harmonica.

592
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:54,100
I'm clicking harmonica. You guys, this is why you can't have nice things.

593
01:37:54,739 --> 01:38:01,460
It's actually B. I looked it up. Did you look it up? Was this real?

594
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:10,329
Thank you. And now slip into your leisure suit and prepare to enter the land of

595
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:21,420
lounge lizards with leisure shoot suit Larry. Okay, I got it ready. All right,

596
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:27,560
there I am. I want to exit this game just because how slow you move.

597
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:37,210
Why is he like an octopus? He's like a squid. I guess we're gonna go in here. This is a bar.

598
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:56,180
Nice tuck and roll. What? So that right click is change. Right click changes what you do.

599
01:38:56,180 --> 01:39:12,859
That's porn music. This is porn. Okay, we're good. Why is Dr. Dawn back here? That's Dr.

600
01:39:12,859 --> 01:39:22,810
Dan. He has nothing to say but says it continuously. You coily turn your back and

601
01:39:22,810 --> 01:39:28,569
relieve yourself. You quickly feel much better. The hint of smile. What? Did I just piss on the

602
01:39:28,569 --> 01:39:38,819
ground? This place has no taste. I can like taste things? To you, Lefty has no distinctive

603
01:39:38,819 --> 01:39:56,739
smell or taste. You greet the bartender with a friendly hello. What'll it be? Around. Around

604
01:39:56,739 --> 01:40:09,319
for everybody. Are you sure? It'll cost you $90. Do I not have that money? Blah, blah,

605
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:14,840
blah. Yackity, yackity, yackity, yackity, blah, blah. Because Thursday's your night in the barrel.

606
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:46,069
Har har. What? Why am I moving so slow? Talk to someone in particular. Can I leave? Can I speed

607
01:40:46,069 --> 01:40:49,670
up this emulator? I don't think... I mean this is just like on a website. It's like a browser.

608
01:40:50,229 --> 01:41:00,739
I'm not sure I can do it from here. Is it rad on the guy's head? You take pity on the poor

609
01:41:00,739 --> 01:41:19,510
drunken want to help him, but his odor convinces you otherwise. Oh, fuck. There we go. Oh, Jesus.

610
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:33,300
That's so much better. All right. We're going up? Down? Where are we going? Into the bar?

611
01:41:34,390 --> 01:42:31,800
Through the toilet. Did it crash? I crashed. I think it was like fucked up. Something happened.

612
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:37,460
I saw Leisure Suit Larry's dick and then like he started shitting. So no, we're not

613
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:58,310
gonna do that one. I'm sorry. I'm not doing that one. Uh, not gonna happen. Nope. Sorry.

614
01:42:58,310 --> 01:43:02,869
We'll get him next time. No, vetoing all of them now. I'm gonna use my actual real veto power.

615
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:21,220
Call me a tyrant. I'm using my true veto powers. So that brings us to here. Now we've done three.

616
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:31,029
Let's go down to here. Make sure we get the ones with the text only. Text only. Remember,

617
01:43:31,029 --> 01:43:52,340
that's very important. And here we go. Please click what you'd like to see. Wow,

618
01:43:52,340 --> 01:44:06,340
this is all over the place. This is very, very, very spread out, but there is a clear

619
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:26,680
winner. Very much so. With 35% or 37% of the vote at this point. Everyone seems to be changing

620
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:41,100
their mind. Thank you for voting. That's all we need to see. To spread out. Where in the USA

621
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:58,899
is Carmen Sandiego? Thank you for voting. 1993. C is Mount... whatever that said. I think this

622
01:44:58,899 --> 01:45:29,020
is the Zumbini's people by the way. I already like this one. Where are we? Where in the USA

623
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:38,340
are we? That's a huge antenna. That would be poking you in like the mouth and nose and

624
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:45,560
shit. That would go up your nose and kill you. You would like, you would sneeze and that antenna

625
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:56,500
would go into your nose, through your nostril, into your brain and you die. What are we doing?

626
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:13,739
Eject. Eject. Where is she? Where did she go? She went somewhere in the United States.

627
01:46:13,739 --> 01:46:32,970
This is me? Vile. Vile. Vile. What? Is this Carmen Sandiego's like group of people?

628
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:42,699
You're taking a very long time to do this. Why couldn't you just pick them up?

629
01:46:42,699 --> 01:47:01,289
They're like the airport. Okay. ACME. Okay. Come choose. ACME Detective Registration.

630
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:21,189
Enter your name. No. Okay. How do I go back? Can I delete that? Where's backspace? Is there

631
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:38,119
no backspace? Use the keyboard? Oh fuck. No, it's cancel. Okay. Transmit. Verifying identity.

632
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:41,960
Updating ACME Detective Roster. Stand by for an important message from the Chief.

633
01:47:46,279 --> 01:47:59,979
Hey. I'm gonna turn this up. Agent Germa rank gumshoe.

634
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:13,479
Okay. Location New York. We have until Sunday at 8 p.m. It is Monday. We have a week

635
01:48:14,539 --> 01:48:20,300
in New York. All the lights on Broadway have been stolen. Let me turn this up for you guys.

636
01:48:22,649 --> 01:48:30,710
Every light. Okay. So let's call the ACME Travel Services. We're gonna get to New York.

637
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:39,579
To start your investigation, call ACME Travel Service. I was gonna click it.

638
01:48:42,470 --> 01:49:06,279
We only have one option anyways. I can't. It's gonna just do it. Manhattan Island.

639
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:10,439
The heart of New York City is connected to the mainland by a number of

640
01:49:10,439 --> 01:49:14,279
bridges. Perhaps the most famous of these is the graceful arching Brooklyn Bridge,

641
01:49:14,279 --> 01:49:20,539
which links Manhattan to the borough of Brooklyn. Speak to student. He cried

642
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:33,699
off for Omaha. Who did? Check campus. Item book description titled Adventures on the

643
01:49:33,699 --> 01:49:37,939
Old Oregon Trail. There's a chapter missing about the trail along the Platte River.

644
01:49:41,369 --> 01:49:47,140
Oregon Trail. Oregon. All right. Telephone Crime Net.

645
01:49:57,109 --> 01:50:00,869
Message from Crime Net. Plane closed. Cop reports seeing suspect in the plane

646
01:50:00,869 --> 01:50:25,300
state north of Kansas. What? Okay. So we got to go north of Kansas. We don't have,

647
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:39,930
I mean we could go here. Should we go to Lincoln? Go to Florida. Lincoln, Nebraska. Let's go.

648
01:50:39,930 --> 01:50:44,439
She's going to be in the car and drive off. Sleeping, sleeping, sleeping, sleeping, sleeping,

649
01:50:44,439 --> 01:50:49,699
sleeping. Nebraska has top notch hunting, fishing, and camping to attract those who

650
01:50:49,699 --> 01:50:55,380
love the great outdoors. For those who prefer to take their outdoor recreation sitting down,

651
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:03,539
that person died. There's a multitude of rodeos to visit. What is that supposed to be?

652
01:51:10,119 --> 01:51:14,579
When I think of Nebraska, I don't think of circus performers.

653
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:24,579
Okay. So let's speak to the violinist. He said he had a capital idea to infiltrate

654
01:51:24,579 --> 01:51:30,890
the capital building of the spud state. He asked me if I knew a good mambo teacher.

655
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:39,939
That would be Idaho. Check the pit. This is the dictaphone. Description heard on tape.

656
01:51:39,939 --> 01:51:44,739
It all boils down to this, small fry. When searching for the spud state, look under capital

657
01:51:44,739 --> 01:51:55,479
I. Dustin. All right. Idaho. Keep your eyes peeled for the criminal in the spud state.

658
01:51:56,890 --> 01:52:14,779
You've got it. Boise. What the fuck is this game? It's called Freelance Palish. Open up.

659
01:52:14,779 --> 01:52:18,619
Although much of Idaho's mountains terrain is not well suited for agriculture.

660
01:52:19,579 --> 01:52:39,850
There's ice skating in Idaho? That was a, what's going on? Okay. Some parts of the state

661
01:52:39,850 --> 01:52:44,409
can successfully support ranches and farms. Cattle ranching and dairy farming are both

662
01:52:44,409 --> 01:52:49,289
important here, but Idaho's most famous product is the potato. Let's talk to the jogger.

663
01:52:51,449 --> 01:52:56,649
He indicated he'd be transplanting himself to Baltimore for a caper at Johns Hopkins medical

664
01:52:56,649 --> 01:53:02,979
school. Beware of anyone who challenges you to a game of go fish. It's fucking Mario. Super

665
01:53:02,979 --> 01:53:14,409
Mario. Call it in. Okay. So, but just Maryland? Do we just have to fly back and forth?

666
01:53:16,789 --> 01:53:29,140
U.S. Naval Academy on Chesapeake Bay. Yeah. Okay. So we just have to go to Maryland now.

667
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:41,739
What day is it? Do we have any evidence? Enter evidence and press transmit. Oh no. Oh no, no,

668
01:53:41,739 --> 01:53:51,510
no, no. Wait, wait. I didn't want to do this. Cancel. This game is nonsense. A coquette

669
01:53:51,510 --> 01:54:01,939
made this game. What? What are you talking about? All right. Let's go to Maryland.

670
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:14,039
Why would you, what does that even mean? Okay. Question jogger again.

671
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:40,170
Oh, gold teeth. Is that him? That's the worst one yet. That's not how you hide to Ivan. Okay.

672
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:45,750
He was determined to lose himself in the largest state in the nation. He collected recipes from

673
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:56,939
Paris. Okay. Um, well, I know, mail, hair hobby, card games, gardening, painting, star

674
01:54:57,819 --> 01:55:05,699
card games, go fish. Do we get my, we should have been doing this.

675
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:09,880
All right. Let's like enter that into evidence. Transmit that.

676
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:21,750
Warn division. Wanda here. Oh, no, no, no. I don't want to, I don't want to warn. Stand by.

677
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:28,539
I know that he's mail and likes card games. I've sent you a list of possible suspects.

678
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:47,020
Every Magic the Gathering convention. That's it. Hallelujah. And Ray Zerumpis are the only

679
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:58,649
two people in the country that are male and like card games. Okay. This is the fair city

680
01:55:58,649 --> 01:56:06,840
of Fairbanks. Our biggest state in the, what is it? Fucking Alaska, Texas. Which one is it?

681
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:24,380
California. Are we talking like volume? It's Texas. Yeah, let's go. What do you mean?

682
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:43,829
It is Alaska. I had it right. Okay. What do you mean I didn't know that?

683
01:56:44,710 --> 01:56:54,170
You're dumping trash here? What are you, why are you dumping trash in Alaska? That's not even like,

684
01:56:54,170 --> 01:57:07,670
hey, I'm a bad guy spying on you. We're just dumping in Alaska. What? Okay. So let's talk

685
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:11,189
to the actress. There are a lot of shady characters lurking around here. I'd be

686
01:57:11,189 --> 01:57:16,170
careful if I were you. By the way, do you have a warrant? That's Carmen San Diego right

687
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:40,659
there. Arrest. How do you arrest a person? She's gone. File written in large black letters

688
01:57:40,659 --> 01:58:00,890
in the front. Okay. I just let Carmen San Diego go. There they go. We're going in the Ghostbusters

689
01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:33,670
car. Did we get them? Urgent report. Ray Zarumpis has just been tracked to Alaska by

690
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:39,159
Gumshoe Jerma. However, the suspect could not be held because the arresting officer

691
01:58:39,159 --> 01:58:51,930
did not have a warrant. No, you're going to have to try. Okay. Are you ready for another

692
01:58:51,930 --> 01:59:08,149
case? No, I don't really want to fly from city to city. That was fun. That was cute. It was fun.

693
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:21,350
It was like a game for kids. That's going to be it for that one. It was like a game. You know,

694
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:30,409
it was like a game for kids. Alright, so we got a couple more to do here. Get the list back

695
01:59:30,409 --> 01:59:43,189
on. It was right here, if I'm not mistaken, right? Right here. This looks correct. Is it

696
01:59:43,189 --> 01:59:53,659
correct or was it down more like right here? Yeah, it was right there. Okay. So remember

697
01:59:53,659 --> 02:00:01,779
the text on the screen. Do not click ones that do not have text. Like don't click down here.

698
02:00:01,779 --> 02:00:08,789
You're not going to be valid. Only places with text. Here we go. Please click on the

699
02:00:08,789 --> 02:00:12,539
screen where you'd like us to go next. It's up to you, not up to me.

700
02:00:22,659 --> 02:00:48,970
Interesting. Interesting selections. How many times can you click once? One click per person.

701
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:54,180
That's as many. It's not going to count if you do it again. It's only going to count the first

702
02:00:54,180 --> 02:01:07,770
time. So we got 32%. We're going to burger time. Thank you for voting. We will come back here

703
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:13,140
and we will do the last one on this list. So yeah, I'm not going to click. I'm going to

704
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:27,539
actually open a new window. Burger time. This is by 1982. This is really old. I failed to

705
02:01:27,539 --> 02:01:37,060
download the metadata. Oh no, why is that? Good places to be. Mattel Electronics presents

706
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:43,670
Burger Time. Type joystick or keyboard to start. I mean we have to use keyboard. Press the space

707
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:50,939
bar to start the game. Press the zero key to select options. To pause game. What were the

708
02:01:50,939 --> 02:02:04,310
controls? Which character am I? What's going on? To pepper, press the space bar. To move

709
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:13,859
the chef, use the up down left right. Okay. Here we go. If you don't know how to do

710
02:02:13,859 --> 02:02:19,270
burger time, burger time is you have to make a hamburger. Wait, don't you have to

711
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:31,300
knock them down? Oh no, you have to kill them by knocking them down. Now I remember. I thought

712
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:34,260
you had to make. Oh no, you do have to make a burger. No, no, I'm right. I was right. I was

713
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:51,939
right. Oh, I got it. All right. I got to get this one right. See if we can get them all.

714
02:02:54,680 --> 02:03:24,899
Get it. Oh, I need a bun. Bait them over here. Down. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops.

715
02:03:24,899 --> 02:03:37,579
It's okay. Let's close this one out. Bingo. Oh, I thought they were going to go hey.

716
02:03:37,579 --> 02:03:57,770
They're all clumped up too. Oops. There's one burger done. I'm just going to do buns.

717
02:03:59,350 --> 02:04:06,579
Fuck. I thought they're going to keep walking. What is this thing? Is it like a power up?

718
02:04:06,579 --> 02:04:12,789
Got it. All right. Let's do. Let's wait. We got time. Oh, not good. Not good. Not good.

719
02:04:12,789 --> 02:04:32,090
I have to bait this one. Let me get all four burgs all the way, all the way, all the way,

720
02:04:32,090 --> 02:05:09,819
all the way up, all the way. Bait them all over here. Every single one. Oh, that was close.

721
02:05:09,819 --> 02:05:22,140
Get them all. All four. No, I'm going to get collapsed on. Oh, no, no. Pepper, pepper,

722
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:29,800
pepper, pepper, pepper, pepper. I'm dead. Fuck. I'm so mad. Oh, my god damn. No, I got an extra life.

723
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:34,020
Shit. I try to get them. I got to go all the way up. Coffee. Oh, fuck. Right here. Right here.

724
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:59,180
Right here. Got it. I have no pepper left, do I? Uh-oh. I got to go down. Now. Fuck.

725
02:07:03,659 --> 02:07:44,939
I got two more lives. I'm losing them here. Oh, I lost it. I can still do it.

726
02:07:44,939 --> 02:08:11,670
Oh, no. Ah. No. Fuck. This game is so much fun. Come on. I can do it. I get to level three.

727
02:08:11,670 --> 02:08:34,260
I can do it. I have two more buns. Baited. Good work. I hate it. That's it. Fuck.

728
02:08:35,300 --> 02:09:03,800
I had it too. I was doing so well. Last try. Last try. This is the last one. Straight up.

729
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:28,710
No, come up here. Straight up. No unnecessary deaths here. And then smush them. Smush.

730
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:39,590
I can't believe I didn't get it. I'm fucking done. I'm exiting. I just. I got too greedy.

731
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:47,270
I really did. I didn't get that. I'm losing it. That was greedy too, but it was worth it.

732
02:09:47,989 --> 02:10:00,550
Too bad I don't have anything to do anything right here, but I can get something right now.

733
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:26,970
If I get up there quick enough, I can get at least one of them. Stupid. Stupid little

734
02:10:26,970 --> 02:10:46,279
lettuces. Whatever you are. Give me points. All right. Last one. And then I'm going to go

735
02:10:46,279 --> 02:11:02,520
for the clothes here. Oh, fuck. I got to go up. Oh, no. Pepper. It's close. They're

736
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:23,430
pickles. You dill. What are the other things? Onions? Ah, too greedy. Don't do it. I got

737
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:44,300
so greedy. I'm you. I'm doing too much pepper. I need this pepper. I'm going too fast. Oh,

738
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:49,020
dude. I'm going to, you know, I'm going to watch somebody do like a full speed run

739
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:58,600
of this game tomorrow. Why tomorrow? I don't know. All right. I'm going to do this one.

740
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:03,510
I'm going to get it. Perfect. After that person speeds by the house as fast as they can.

741
02:12:03,510 --> 02:12:28,260
Start from the top. Didn't get it. Didn't get it. It's okay. No, he went up the other

742
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:38,550
way. He went up the other way. Damn it. I thought he was going to go down. Get over

743
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:42,229
here. What the fuck was that shit? He walked to the right. What was that little juke to

744
02:12:42,229 --> 02:13:57,859
the right? I can't fucking believe he went that way. Oh, God damn it. That game's a

745
02:13:57,859 --> 02:14:11,800
lot of fun, but it's really hard. Okay. Where are we going? Gamer in his natural habitat,

746
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:25,619
making noise to attract his mate. That's one of those old arcade cabinet games.

747
02:14:25,619 --> 02:14:46,489
It's a good one. All right. Um, Catacombs 3D. I believe this says gamer's edge,

748
02:14:46,569 --> 02:15:15,640
the gamer's edge, apparently 54%. Thank you for voting. We're going to Catacombs 3D.

749
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:30,310
Here we go. Uh, it's gamer's edge. This looks like a bloody game is by id software.

750
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:40,539
If you're curious, this is like a doom game or video molds, CGA, EGA, VGA, um,

751
02:15:40,539 --> 02:15:54,760
keyboard memory. I think this looks all right. Catacombs 3D, gamer's edge. It's a 1-800

752
02:15:54,760 --> 02:16:04,680
number. id software. You know who those people are. It's high score. Joe, Steph, Sir Lancelot,

753
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:22,579
and Boombi. New game. Normal. Entering the approach. Oh, I can use the mouse.

754
02:16:27,699 --> 02:16:34,100
Woe be to he that entereth my domain. Grem, Grelminar, the lich.

755
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:49,670
Whoa, I just threw a fireball. Path to keep. Okay. I guess I throw fireballs

756
02:16:50,229 --> 02:16:57,799
and I can throw a nuke. I'm just going to queue it up the whole time. Just hold it.

757
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:30,889
Got him. Holy shit, that was creepy. It's like bullet travel. Keys, scrolls. Okay. A portal.

758
02:17:30,889 --> 02:17:44,659
Actual Diablo portal. What's wrong with my face? Why am I wearing a... Okay, I'm in the keep.

759
02:17:49,639 --> 02:18:06,549
The charge is the best. I hear somebody walking. Fire walls? Oops.

760
02:18:11,219 --> 02:18:20,250
Chest over here. Potions? Help? Heals. Okay. There's just money in that chest.

761
02:18:20,889 --> 02:18:42,520
Ooh, nukes. How does one use a nuke? Oh, that felt pretty good. Heals and nukes.

762
02:18:43,159 --> 02:18:51,350
I hear somebody. And I got a key. Where is this person? They're freaking me out.

763
02:18:58,389 --> 02:19:05,079
What is... I don't understand. Oh, here's the key. Let me check over here. Did I go this way?

764
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:21,079
Maybe H is to heal? H. H is heal. I want to get to the boss, at least.

765
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:35,530
That's my footsteps? I'm talking about this. That just means you can't go any further.

766
02:19:36,250 --> 02:20:01,350
I have the key. I also got lightning bolt. Yeah, this is just operation. All right, key.

767
02:20:02,469 --> 02:20:07,750
We're in here now. All right, next level. B for bolt. Well, I don't need it yet.

768
02:20:08,569 --> 02:20:43,530
Is it N for nuke? Good. Two bolts. Three bolts. Motion sickness. Yeah, I'm getting it too.

769
02:20:44,329 --> 02:20:59,799
I am getting it too. You're right. Why'd you say that? Now I'm getting it. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah,

770
02:20:59,799 --> 02:21:12,010
you're right. It's bad. Eject. Eject. Eject. No, no. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I can

771
02:21:12,010 --> 02:21:36,120
handle it for like another minute. This is the bad type of motion sickness. This game's fun,

772
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:45,399
though. It's a cool game. Spray and pray? I'm not spraying and praying. I'm landing shots.

773
02:21:46,520 --> 02:22:00,860
Blue key. Out. Let's go. Anybody remember what anything was? Drop a nuke? I'll drop a nuke

774
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:13,670
before we leave. Here we go. Blue key. All right. I'm going to barf. All right.

775
02:22:15,190 --> 02:22:24,659
I'm going to nuke and then I'm still alive though. I need red key. Just get it. Just

776
02:22:24,659 --> 02:22:41,129
stand like a few feet away from your screen. Oh my God. That was bolt. Bolt's just rapid

777
02:22:41,129 --> 02:22:54,819
fire. Big ball. I'm going to nuke the next person I see. Nuke. I'm hovering over it.

778
02:22:55,379 --> 02:23:07,459
It just goes out around the whole room. Okay. It's very fun. This is a cool game,

779
02:23:12,659 --> 02:23:19,850
but I think we have to move on before everyone pukes. You missed the nuke?

780
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:31,350
I can't do it again. Yeah. Okay. This is really cool though. I don't want to make

781
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:36,600
everybody puke because I'm like feeling it. That's a cool game. Cool. It is cool.

782
02:23:37,079 --> 02:23:50,459
That was very, for how long ago that was? That's, you know, that's the titans of the video game

783
02:23:50,459 --> 02:23:57,879
industry. Come on. So now we're going to go down. We're going to scroll for the first time

784
02:23:57,879 --> 02:24:04,889
tonight, right? Oh no. Did we scroll before? No, no, no. For the second time. So we were here.

785
02:24:05,530 --> 02:24:20,149
This is what we did. Now we're going to go down here. Here is, okay. So like right here.

786
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:35,430
There we go. Because that, oh, because Hocus Pocus, no, Hocus Pocus was up there. Right here.

787
02:24:36,069 --> 02:24:52,229
Remember it's the text on the screen. So that looks, was House of Horrors up there?

788
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:56,620
I don't think it was. It's just weird that they're in such strange places.

789
02:24:58,709 --> 02:25:15,979
That looks all right. All right. Are you ready? Please vote right now. Girlfriend

790
02:25:15,979 --> 02:25:40,940
construction set. Oh God. Girlfriend construction. Resize the zoom. I actually, before the stream

791
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:45,819
started, I tried a bunch of stuff. I tried going zooming in and out. I tried refreshing. I tried

792
02:25:45,819 --> 02:25:49,260
clearing cache. It's something about when you go down a few times, it just kind of does this.

793
02:25:53,079 --> 02:25:57,020
All right. Well, this is girlfriend construction set. I'm going to, thanks for voting.

794
02:25:57,020 --> 02:26:02,409
First of all, second of all, I'm concerned about this one because this could be a porn

795
02:26:02,409 --> 02:26:44,059
game. Let's see. Um, let's see. Uh, start a new game. Enter your first name. I don't want to

796
02:26:44,059 --> 02:26:49,020
put my real name. Bill. Enter the first name of the girl you wish to create.

797
02:26:49,739 --> 02:27:05,020
Didn't they make a movie on this like a long time ago? It's not going to do Kim. Something

798
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:32,780
like, um, Janice. I don't know. Henrietta. Jen. How about just Jen. Select a face.

799
02:27:34,059 --> 02:27:40,520
All right. I want like one, I think. I think it's going to be number one.

800
02:27:49,579 --> 02:28:07,139
Definitely one. No, I'm picking this. It's one. Enter Jen's height. 60 inches is five.

801
02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:20,549
I'm 62 inches guys. No, no, no, I'm not. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. 60. What am I? What

802
02:28:20,549 --> 02:28:32,780
is like five eight? No, that's five. That would be five two. Um, I'm like 60. What is it? 68?

803
02:28:37,290 --> 02:28:48,329
That's five two. No, I'm, I'm, that's like, I'm 68 or 69. Just don't. So 60. We'll do 63.

804
02:28:58,420 --> 02:29:29,430
Um, Jen's overall body rating is zero. How attractively does Jen dress?

805
02:29:29,510 --> 02:29:39,510
Rubby. How trustworthy is Jen? Uh, seven. How often does Jen get jealous? Um, not really.

806
02:29:39,510 --> 02:29:46,309
How would you rate Jen's personality? Very friendly. What's Jen's type of mood? Jesus.

807
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:52,440
Uh, seven. How well do you get along with Jen's friends and how well does she get along with

808
02:29:52,440 --> 02:29:57,959
yours? They hate each other. Is Jen desperate to get married? Very desperate. What is Jen's

809
02:29:57,959 --> 02:30:03,079
level of sexual activity? Oh, she can be a while. Um, I don't know, right in the middle.

810
02:30:04,090 --> 02:30:15,350
Overall rating of Jen is 34. Bill's status points is 50. Date selected. Go out to dinner. Call

811
02:30:15,350 --> 02:30:24,940
girlfriend. Jen, do you want to go out to dinner? Yes, I'd love it. You get to the

812
02:30:24,940 --> 02:30:29,899
restaurant and find your table. After taking your order, the waiter returns and accidentally

813
02:30:29,899 --> 02:30:39,780
spills soup all over your date's blouse. Jen says, oh, that hurts. You punch out the

814
02:30:39,780 --> 02:30:43,620
waiter and get arrested. Jen waves at you as you are being fitted with handcuffs. Nice.

815
02:30:46,659 --> 02:30:58,500
Get off me. Get off me. No, I'm gonna go to dinner. Yeah, I'd love it. You go to dinner

816
02:30:58,500 --> 02:31:03,700
to a fancy restaurant. When you get inside, you see a really hot lady in a low cut dress.

817
02:31:03,700 --> 02:31:14,329
You stare intently at her cleavage. Jen gives you a dirty look. She's not my type.

818
02:31:15,719 --> 02:31:19,719
You sit down at your table while you're waiting for the waiter to come and take your order.

819
02:31:19,719 --> 02:31:35,530
Jen reaches under the table and starts acting bored. You each have a very enjoyable dinner,

820
02:31:35,530 --> 02:31:41,620
Jen asks. Do you want to order some rich fattening desserts? Sure, let's do it.

821
02:31:41,620 --> 02:31:49,860
What happened? Can we do anything besides go out to dinner? You get to the restaurant

822
02:31:49,860 --> 02:31:53,940
and the waiter comes over. Oh, excuse me. Oh, whoops, I spilled. Fuck you.

823
02:31:55,620 --> 02:32:02,549
You get arrested. Get off me. Next week. You want to go to dinner? I'm sorry,

824
02:32:02,549 --> 02:32:51,899
Bill. I can't go out with you anymore. You got dumped. No, no, no, no, 180. This person's

825
02:32:53,020 --> 02:33:15,500
like a stick bug. Skeleton weighs more than that. I fucked it up. Okay, date list. Jesus.

826
02:33:16,219 --> 02:33:25,940
Go horseback riding. That sounds like fun. Gene, do you want to go horseback riding?

827
02:33:25,940 --> 02:33:37,110
I don't think so. Go skiing. Gene, do you want to go skiing in the Alps?

828
02:33:37,190 --> 02:33:42,620
Okay. You and your girlfriend arrive in Switzerland and you hit the slopes. After a very active day

829
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:47,500
of skiing, you retire to the lodge and snuggle up to a warm fire. Just the two of you sitting

830
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:56,149
by the fire. Gene says, isn't this romantic? It really is. I suppose so. I guess so. Let's

831
02:33:56,149 --> 02:34:06,329
just shut up. Let's go drink some dark beer. Um, I suppose. You two are sitting together

832
02:34:06,329 --> 02:34:09,129
enjoying a moment of great intimacy. She looks long in the eye with glazed eyes,

833
02:34:09,129 --> 02:34:20,649
then suddenly Gene sighs, let's get married right now. You're kidding? I don't think that

834
02:34:20,649 --> 02:34:25,479
would be such a good idea at this time. I think we need... You two decide to get married and

835
02:34:25,479 --> 02:34:29,799
have your honeymoon right there. Gene looks stunning in her beautiful wedding dress. She

836
02:34:29,799 --> 02:34:41,700
brought the wedding dress with her on our first date. The happy couple lives happily ever after

837
02:34:41,700 --> 02:34:46,680
in the suburbs for a few months. Eventually you both realize the marriage was a mistake.

838
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:54,379
You have more and more bitter fights. Finally, Gene divorces you and takes half your money.

839
02:34:54,459 --> 02:35:32,170
Oh shit. Go to... How about go? She's an aunt. Go to the big party.

840
02:35:33,750 --> 02:35:39,290
Jessica, do you want to go to the big party? No way, I'm not that dumb. Do you want to

841
02:35:39,290 --> 02:35:44,469
go to the zoo? She's gonna get like licked up by a giraffe. No way, I'm not that dumb to

842
02:35:44,469 --> 02:35:49,030
go to the zoo. You're not stupid enough to go to the zoo. What about the opera?

843
02:35:49,030 --> 02:36:00,219
Do you want to go to the opera? I'm not that dumb. Um, do you, uh, you want to go

844
02:36:00,299 --> 02:36:09,450
fly to Vegas for the weekend? No, I'm not that stupid. What is not stupid? Go to Hawaii for lunch.

845
02:36:09,450 --> 02:36:13,909
No way, I'm not that dumb. These are all extravagant, incredibly expensive, insanely

846
02:36:13,909 --> 02:36:23,340
awesome dates. Do you want to come over? No way, I'm not that dumb. Aren't we dating?

847
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:35,030
Aren't we... What are you talking about? Go to, uh, go mail strip joint. No way, I'm not

848
02:36:35,030 --> 02:36:51,030
that dumb. No, I'm not that stupid. Go to dinner? No. Apparently that's not stupid,

849
02:36:51,030 --> 02:36:57,909
it's just no. You want to go shopping? Forget it. You want to go to the bar? No, I'm not

850
02:36:57,909 --> 02:37:02,139
stupid. Would you like to just, would you like to go to a rock concert? Some other time,

851
02:37:02,139 --> 02:37:06,620
maybe. Would you like to go to a Broadway show? No, I'm, I'm smart. Would you like

852
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:09,659
to go to a party to one of my friend's place? No, I'm, I'm smart. You want to

853
02:37:09,659 --> 02:37:14,219
play strip poker? No way, I'm not that dumb. Do you want to go fishing? Uh, no way,

854
02:37:14,219 --> 02:37:18,459
I'm not, I'm, I'm very, fishing is for stupid, stupid idiots, huh? Uh, play strip

855
02:37:18,459 --> 02:37:21,739
monopoly. You want to do that? No, no, monopoly's dumb, it's for dumb people. You

856
02:37:21,739 --> 02:37:32,459
want to go to a hockey game? Hockey's not even, she likes hockey. You arrive at the

857
02:37:32,459 --> 02:37:35,579
hockey game with your date. Early in the game, one of the players gets thrown into

858
02:37:35,579 --> 02:37:42,059
the boards right near your seat. Jessica is startled and puts an arm around you impulsively.

859
02:37:42,059 --> 02:37:53,909
Oh my fucking god. Oh my god. Uh, relax, it's fine. The game starts to get really

860
02:37:53,909 --> 02:37:57,989
exciting. Someone almost scores a goal. Suddenly two players start fighting. Then

861
02:37:57,989 --> 02:38:01,190
four players are going at it. Then the entire teams are fighting. The bench is

862
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:05,350
empty. All the players are out on the ice fighting. Then the crowd starts

863
02:38:05,350 --> 02:38:10,629
fighting. A couple of bald guys with beer belly start punching away nearby.

864
02:38:10,629 --> 02:38:15,030
One of them is thrown sprawling into you too. Jessica starts punching

865
02:38:15,110 --> 02:38:27,799
with wild abandon. Why? Why would I do that? What? Aren't we on the same team?

866
02:38:28,700 --> 02:38:41,819
We're on the same team. There's no reason for that. Just like, oh yeah, oh here comes

867
02:38:41,819 --> 02:38:48,059
a big fight. Get him. Two bald guys are fighting us. Hey, honey. Wrong person.

868
02:38:49,239 --> 02:38:52,920
What the fuck are you talking about? We're on the same team. She's punching.

869
02:38:53,559 --> 02:39:04,299
No! Are you out of your fucking mind? We're on the same damn team.

870
02:39:04,299 --> 02:39:12,309
That was certainly a messy scene. The hockey game is finally over. Neither of you has any

871
02:39:12,309 --> 02:39:16,090
idea who won. Does it really matter? You both get back to your car while avoiding

872
02:39:16,090 --> 02:39:21,780
the hyper drunk fans. Jessica remarks, hockey is really stupid. You're a moron.

873
02:39:31,180 --> 02:39:37,940
Wasn't she just... She started fighting before I did. She was throwing punches before I even...

874
02:39:38,579 --> 02:39:50,840
She was beating people up? Hey, want to come over to my place? She thinks over your offer

875
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:59,049
for a moment. Then Jessica says, no way. I'm not that kind of girl. Here, have a flower.

876
02:39:59,049 --> 02:40:02,010
You pull up in her driveway and shut off the engine. She gets out of the car and you

877
02:40:02,010 --> 02:40:12,299
follow her and walk to the door. She frowns and says, get lost. Okay. So long. So long. See

878
02:40:12,299 --> 02:40:20,700
you later. Whatever. I can't win with you. I dump her before she dumps me. Quick. Yes.

879
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:34,489
So every idea is stupid. I don't want to go to dinner. Finally, I want to go to a hockey game.

880
02:40:35,049 --> 02:40:41,639
She says, yes. Uh, the crowd starts fighting. She starts punching people in the face.

881
02:40:41,639 --> 02:40:46,280
She starts beating people up. I joined the fray and I'm like, we're on the same team.

882
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:50,360
Hey, that was crazy. You're stupid. You're a moron. Okay. I'll drop you off. Loser. Get out

883
02:40:50,360 --> 02:41:04,940
of here. We noticed what? What happened? I think we're going to have to, I think we're

884
02:41:04,940 --> 02:41:10,549
going to close it on that one. I feel like we saw the best possible ridiculous scenario.

885
02:41:12,899 --> 02:42:09,770
One more. All right. We'll do one more. One more. Um, eight. Okay. Overflow redo. I broke the game.

886
02:42:09,770 --> 02:42:40,229
She's like, how tall is that? Jip. I broke it. Jip. Press any key. Deo rating is two. Okay.

887
02:42:40,229 --> 02:42:47,450
Let's see. What do you want to do? How about let's go fishing? Um, I don't know. She's

888
02:42:47,450 --> 02:42:54,680
going to be fly to Vegas for the weekend. No, it's not going to be hockey again. Let's

889
02:42:54,680 --> 02:43:01,430
go scuba diving. I'd love to. Here we go. Good. You and your girlfriend arrive in

890
02:43:01,430 --> 02:43:06,309
Cozumel, Mexico and hop on a boat for some exhilarating scuba diving. After carefully

891
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:10,229
checking the equipment and reviewing the fundamental rules of diving, you dive off

892
02:43:10,229 --> 02:43:15,829
into the deep and do some exploration and practice some buddy breathing. After a very

893
02:43:15,829 --> 02:43:20,629
active day of diving. She's such an active woman, isn't she? During which you both get

894
02:43:20,629 --> 02:43:25,190
quite wet. You retire to the villa and have a little siesta. Just the two of you.

895
02:43:25,270 --> 02:43:35,049
Jaxette says, isn't this romantic? Uh, Jaxette is also, I think, uh, two to three,

896
02:43:35,049 --> 02:43:44,409
about two to three hundred feet tall. Let's go have some like beer. You two are sitting

897
02:43:44,409 --> 02:43:48,090
together enjoying a moment of great intimacy. She looks long at you with glazed eyes and

898
02:43:48,090 --> 02:43:58,979
suddenly Jaxette blurts, let's get married. You two decide to get married and have your

899
02:43:58,979 --> 02:44:05,590
honeymoon right there. She looks ridiculous in her rented wedding dress. The happy

900
02:44:05,590 --> 02:44:09,030
couple lives happily ever after in the suburbs for a while. Eventually you both

901
02:44:09,030 --> 02:44:11,989
realize the marriage is a mistake. You have more and more bitter fights. Finally,

902
02:44:11,989 --> 02:44:51,899
she divorces you. Oh, well, uh, let's go. Four. Uh, that, that's fine. Why? What are

903
02:44:51,899 --> 02:45:21,110
you talking about? I can't distribute. Uh, I don't know, 30, 25, 26, uh, 20, 20,

904
02:45:22,250 --> 02:45:27,590
23, 25. I don't know. I don't, I don't, there's no such thing as a perfect

905
02:45:27,590 --> 02:45:36,600
person. Okay. I can't, I don't have any points left. Okay. Let's go to,

906
02:45:37,159 --> 02:45:49,500
let's go bowling. That's easy. Are you kidding? No way. Go baseball game. Sure.

907
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:55,860
Okay. Baseball. You can, there's no fights in baseballs. You arrive at the stadium with

908
02:45:55,860 --> 02:46:01,690
your girlfriend and sit down in your nice, comfortable box seats on the third base side.

909
02:46:02,629 --> 02:46:06,629
Perfect. Goes off and buys t-shirts and caps and spends 50 bucks.

910
02:46:06,629 --> 02:46:14,040
Concentrate on the game. Concentrate on the blood. A few seats away. Concentrate on your

911
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:20,329
girlfriend. Read the program. Don't concentrate. It's too hot for that. Uh, let's concentrate

912
02:46:20,329 --> 02:46:25,479
on, concentrate on the girlfriend. You and your girlfriend are sitting drowsily in the hot

913
02:46:25,479 --> 02:46:30,920
sun. The game is dragging on. A slow reliever is on the mound. It takes about 10 minutes to make

914
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:36,840
each pitch. He winds up 10 minutes later. He pitches. It's a well-hit ball. Foul up the

915
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:40,120
third base line. The ball was coming right at you. And before you can quite realize what's

916
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:49,610
happening, you've caught it. Ouch. Ouch. Baseball. I like baseball. What's wrong with

917
02:46:49,610 --> 02:46:54,309
baseball? All right. So I caught the ball. Give the ball to your girlfriend. How sweet.

918
02:46:54,309 --> 02:47:03,000
Hurl the ball at her head. I keep the ball. Hurl the ball at the old lady. Three bros away.

919
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:10,709
Throw the ball at the blonde. Hurl the ball at the third base. Why is this just weirdo,

920
02:47:10,709 --> 02:47:39,079
like fucking psycho simulator? Nothing happened. We went home. I have no idea.

921
02:47:39,639 --> 02:47:45,110
How about come over and go- oh did we drop some frames? Yeah we did.

922
02:47:46,219 --> 02:47:53,510
Come over and go in the swimming pool. I'm sorry I can't go out with you anymore. You've

923
02:47:53,510 --> 02:48:03,750
been dumped. I don't know. Swim at. It's in your name. You have to like swimming.

924
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:20,790
Six? Where's six? Sure. Face negative 14. What? Come over and go swimming in the pool.

925
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:34,489
No way. I want to go swimming. No way. Hot tub. This is gonna be another one of these.

926
02:48:35,219 --> 02:48:38,739
I have to restart the game to get somebody to- okay I'll restart it.

927
02:48:38,739 --> 02:48:47,260
Let me just physically go like this. You lose status points when you get dumped. I see.

928
02:48:47,899 --> 02:49:11,670
I think I broke it. I may have broke the game. All right here we go. New game. My first name.

929
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:18,540
Okay. No not like swim at again. How about just like- I don't know.

930
02:49:32,600 --> 02:49:42,760
Tiffany? How about Tiffany? Okay Tiffany. Tiffany. Okay let's get it. 62.

931
02:49:43,399 --> 02:49:47,399
I don't know. 130. Measurement in inches. I don't know these.

932
02:49:52,020 --> 02:50:03,540
Uh overall ratings are three. Okay you dress- all right. A trustworthy. Very trustworthy.

933
02:50:04,100 --> 02:50:06,579
Tiffany doesn't really know. Doesn't get jealous that often.

934
02:50:07,299 --> 02:50:13,459
Personality. Friendly. Very friendly. Uh happy. How long do you get along with Tiffany's friends?

935
02:50:13,459 --> 02:50:23,989
Get along well. All right let's go. I want to go swimming. You don't want to go swimming.

936
02:50:23,989 --> 02:50:41,530
I want to go in the hot tub. Uh let's just drip monopoly. Local beach.

937
02:50:43,670 --> 02:50:54,059
Forget it. Why? Horseback riding. Sounds like fun. Here we go. Finally.

938
02:50:55,340 --> 02:51:00,379
You go horseback riding with your girlfriend. You follow the trails at the old west riding

939
02:51:00,379 --> 02:51:05,559
stables. You bounce up and down on your horse and your balls start to get sore.

940
02:51:08,899 --> 02:51:12,579
Your girlfriend seems to be used to it though. She knows her horse well.

941
02:51:12,579 --> 02:51:15,940
Very very well in fact. What? After riding for a couple hours,

942
02:51:15,940 --> 02:51:19,700
Tiffany says this is so exhilarating isn't it? Sure whatever you say.

943
02:51:19,700 --> 02:51:25,850
You're right. That's what I think. Grab your- grab your girl. Aren't we on the horse?

944
02:51:28,219 --> 02:51:37,510
Yeah you're right. That's what I think. That's it. Let's go horseback riding again.

945
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:56,780
Okay grab your horse. Is there any other options? I think that's it. Let's fly to

946
02:51:56,780 --> 02:52:04,469
China for dinner. Why would you fly to China to go to dinner? What kind of like

947
02:52:04,469 --> 02:52:10,860
billionaire are you? What better place to enjoy fine Chinese cuisine than China itself?

948
02:52:11,719 --> 02:52:15,959
You fly to the capital city of China and eat at one of the finest outdoor restaurants

949
02:52:15,959 --> 02:52:23,540
in Tiananmen Square. You decide to order Chinese food. Okay. The food arrives and you both dig in.

950
02:52:23,540 --> 02:52:52,809
Tiffany says I just love Chinese food. I don't get it. Wait. Wait hold on a minute. You

951
02:52:53,930 --> 02:52:58,250
suddenly- wait why? Wait wait wait wait wait a second. Wait a second. This is not good.

952
02:52:58,250 --> 02:53:24,200
You've run around- wait this is hundreds of- troops storm the area. You look all- I gotta

953
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:38,780
get out of here. What the fuck? What? What? Um um get out of this. Out. Out. Out. Out.

954
02:53:43,399 --> 02:54:01,559
Get us out. Out. Get us out. No no no no no. What the fuck is this? Dude I- I can't.

955
02:54:01,559 --> 02:54:23,909
This is fucked. Oh my god. You've got to be fucking kidding me. I just wanted to- oh

956
02:54:28,659 --> 02:54:53,770
that's so terrible. I don't want to- no I'm out. I'm out. God damn it. What the fuck?

957
02:54:54,329 --> 02:55:27,340
Throw it into sub- throw it into sub mode quick. No mods? Oh shit. Well that was um-

958
02:55:27,340 --> 02:55:31,260
I'm a little shocked at the thing that we just witnessed. It was fucking kind of

959
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:36,229
ridiculous. It was very ridiculous actually. Uh we're moving on from that one. I ain't gonna

960
02:55:36,229 --> 02:55:55,219
play that one anymore. So let's go. Here's the list again as you see. I think we have one more

961
02:55:55,219 --> 02:56:17,000
or two what? Two more here. So um okay. Wait this is not right. Uh bingo sunshine thanks

962
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:28,940
to the five community subs. Appreciate it. Thank you for that. Five community subs coming

963
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:35,270
in. Thank you. That was um girlfriend construction simulator or whatever the hell

964
02:56:35,270 --> 02:56:47,670
that was. Girlfriend construction set. We have I believe one more here to do. Please vote when

965
02:56:47,670 --> 02:57:02,170
you get a chance. We just did- I'm not going back and playing that again. No. I'm not going

966
02:57:02,170 --> 02:57:21,000
back and playing it. I'm not doing it. Not happening. I have to pee too. Two more. Two more

967
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:29,110
yeah. All right whatever it is I will- it looks like it's gonna be roadrunner. So when

968
02:57:29,110 --> 02:57:35,799
I come back from taking a piss we will open up roadrunner and we'll play it. Be right back.

969
02:57:41,340 --> 02:57:45,750
I ain't gonna let you get that. You know I'm not gonna leave with the clicks on the screen.

970
02:57:46,309 --> 03:00:42,040
Be right back. All right here we go. Roadrunner. Let's get it done here. 1989.

971
03:00:42,040 --> 03:00:56,149
This is probably gonna be a side scrolling video game. If I were to take a random guess

972
03:00:56,149 --> 03:01:13,620
that's what it would be. Best roadrunners. Roll. Play when using the keyboard. Okay so

973
03:01:13,620 --> 03:01:22,260
KP789. What is this? Instructions. Demo. Redefine keys. So this is- it's the number pad.

974
03:01:26,309 --> 03:01:35,319
$50 just came in from Amferik. Thank you so much Amferik for the huge amount of money

975
03:01:35,319 --> 03:01:40,950
and you had community subs earlier too. Thank you. Yeah we can- we can- we can- what's

976
03:01:40,950 --> 03:01:50,920
happening? Wait, wait, wait. What's going on? Oh okay. You can take it off sub only. But

977
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:53,719
thank you for the 50 bucks Amferik. Just want to say thanks for the streams and all the

978
03:01:53,719 --> 03:01:58,700
content over the years. I'm pretty sure I've always almost died from laughter too much during

979
03:01:58,700 --> 03:02:02,540
some of these streams but totally worth it. You deserve all the support you get so keep doing

980
03:02:02,540 --> 03:02:11,370
you. Thank you. I'm gonna keep doing it. We're gonna keep doing- I'm gonna keep doing it as

981
03:02:11,370 --> 03:02:17,350
long as I possibly can. Let's press escape to play the game. But thank you so much for the

982
03:02:17,350 --> 03:02:25,049
50 bucks. That's a lot of money. Wile E. Coyote and there's me. That's a pretty- that's

983
03:02:25,129 --> 03:02:37,940
you know that's a cute emote version of these characters. What does jump? Let's get the bird

984
03:02:37,940 --> 03:02:44,100
seed. Roadrunner you missed a seed. Roadrunner you missed a seed. You get hit by a car?

985
03:02:45,299 --> 03:02:56,100
I know I missed a seed but what about what do? I got five. That's- I need five right?

986
03:03:03,739 --> 03:03:08,340
Well he- we both got run over so does that really matter?

987
03:03:09,059 --> 03:03:27,989
All right let me get the end of this. Peepo dance. It's hard to see the cars just coming

988
03:03:27,989 --> 03:03:31,110
out of nowhere. There's like not even a foot in front of the screen to see where the cars are

989
03:03:31,110 --> 03:03:45,059
coming from. Can you jump the cars? Maybe it's just spam jump. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

990
03:03:45,780 --> 03:04:18,659
Don't go down down down down! That's so hard to do. Okay oh god again. Down down quick

991
03:04:18,659 --> 03:04:41,819
get up! What's wrong with him? Why is he drunk? I missed 18 bird seeds.

992
03:05:03,399 --> 03:05:08,229
No go this way. Why is he going over there? This is so fucked up.

993
03:05:14,700 --> 03:05:41,209
What the fuck? Why? I'm laughing for a very specific reason and I can't even say anything.

994
03:05:42,010 --> 03:05:53,100
The numpad are the controls. I can't even play this. This game is fucking stupid.

995
03:06:04,760 --> 03:06:14,500
All right. Rude. I mean yeah rude but you have nine different buttons for up, down, left,

996
03:06:14,500 --> 03:06:36,649
and right. Nine. All right here we go. Oh I fucked it up. Sorry. I opened it in a tab last

997
03:06:36,649 --> 03:06:45,260
time. Why did I do this? All right so we have one more to pick from this list. Please pick

998
03:06:45,260 --> 03:06:57,559
it. I wish you luck. Hopefully you pick something good. Let's see what you get. One, two, three.

999
03:06:59,059 --> 03:07:13,670
Please vote if you can. And remember only click on something if it is on the screen like text

1000
03:07:13,670 --> 03:07:28,389
on the screen. So 20% of you just don't want to be counted as a vote. That's okay. And

1001
03:07:28,389 --> 03:07:46,629
you guys want me to play Qbert? You actually want Qbert? Dude I had this sick tattoo I was

1002
03:07:46,629 --> 03:07:51,260
gonna get. You guys would have thought it was fucking awesome. Dude it was gonna be Qbert

1003
03:07:52,409 --> 03:07:58,739
with like weed eyes and he was gonna have a joint like on his hand. It's gonna be fucking

1004
03:07:58,739 --> 03:08:26,020
so awesome. All right let's play Qbert. New tab. Qbert is a very old one. For all you guys

1005
03:08:26,020 --> 03:08:31,219
talk like making fun of the boomer shit you certainly do pick the boomer games.

1006
03:08:31,219 --> 03:08:44,010
All right press space to play. I think it's just to jump on the Qbert is. If I remember you just

1007
03:08:44,010 --> 03:08:53,139
have to turn the yeah no up. You have to turn them all the other colors right? Yes you need

1008
03:08:53,139 --> 03:09:11,370
to change everything to that. So how do I move? Is it space? How do I why can I not jump?

1009
03:09:12,579 --> 03:09:23,059
Number pad? Use your mind. Um let me try it again. I'll try it down on number pad.

1010
03:09:23,059 --> 03:09:35,420
Oh okay there we go hold on. So it is like the what's weird it's one and one three what are

1011
03:09:35,420 --> 03:09:48,170
you doing? Can I all right what's I think it's one three seven nine. Let's try it again.

1012
03:09:48,170 --> 03:09:58,090
Yeah it's one it's definitely it's one three seven nine. Let's go on the numpad.

1013
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:24,389
That is Qbert. Oops I was looking at chat. Okay I got really I got really bored for a second.

1014
03:10:29,350 --> 03:10:34,549
I don't know what it was man. It was like ultimate hyper boredom for five to tenths of a second.

1015
03:10:34,549 --> 03:10:51,879
Here we go. I like to do this technique with Qbert. Go down in the middle here.

1016
03:11:01,579 --> 03:11:30,629
No I try to hit seven. Let's give me a controller god damn it. I'm sorry I can't play

1017
03:11:30,629 --> 03:11:36,250
this game with two hands. I'm up I'm up playing Qbert with two hands on the number pad.

1018
03:11:36,889 --> 03:11:42,729
You know what I mean like put your put your hand on your numpad and like seven nine one

1019
03:11:42,729 --> 03:11:56,629
three. It's like I'm like playing the guitar. I can do that just fine. I don't I don't believe

1020
03:11:56,629 --> 03:12:06,709
that because you have to you have to go from seven to one it's too it's a long way. If you

1021
03:12:06,709 --> 03:12:10,549
need to go up and then down left it's like seven then you have to go all the way down.

1022
03:12:10,549 --> 03:12:28,659
Now I can play that. Put one finger on each button. Yeah but that's what I'm saying I

1023
03:12:28,659 --> 03:12:35,459
don't want to do. What do you mean one finger up. Do I have a claw like index thumb?

1024
03:12:36,569 --> 03:12:50,659
What are you gonna claw the numpad? You're gonna claw the numpad. It's not gonna happen.

1025
03:12:50,659 --> 03:12:54,700
You're gonna accidentally press like two buttons at the same time and then you're gonna go what

1026
03:12:54,700 --> 03:13:06,569
the fuck? What the fuck? One of you probably just did it. I'm just on camera so you get to

1027
03:13:06,569 --> 03:13:17,030
see me do it. I'm thinking about getting like a tattoo of Qbert with like wicked fucking weed

1028
03:13:17,030 --> 03:13:24,940
eyes and he's got like a fucking Guinness in his hand. You know what I mean? Where are we

1029
03:13:24,940 --> 03:13:48,950
going? Does anybody have any clicking? I'm not gonna do girlfriend construction set again.

1030
03:13:48,950 --> 03:14:14,100
Okay we got King's Bounty or we got Bruce Lee. King's Bounty. This is the last one.

1031
03:14:14,100 --> 03:14:21,989
Did three already? Did we? Did we? Oh no we did girlfriend construction. Oh fuck! Uh oh.

1032
03:14:30,149 --> 03:14:39,180
Ladies and gentlemen we're gonna have to go here with uh yeah Qbert didn't count. That's

1033
03:14:39,180 --> 03:14:54,090
true. We're gonna do Bruce Lee. Yeah I didn't play. Qbert didn't count. My hands hurt too

1034
03:14:54,090 --> 03:14:58,489
much when I play it. It's too much pain. I'm gonna throw my fingers. All right let's do

1035
03:14:58,489 --> 03:15:10,969
Bruce Lee. Weed. Oh yeah thinking about getting like weed. TV set on composite. I don't know

1036
03:15:10,969 --> 03:15:31,700
what that just said but okay. This game sounds like it's underwater. Play versus computer

1037
03:15:32,420 --> 03:15:53,059
or Terminator. Let's just try this. Is something wrong with the game? Is this thing fighting

1038
03:15:53,059 --> 03:16:17,940
me? This one hurts. This one hurts more than Qbert. I think I lost. Can I climb?

1039
03:16:17,940 --> 03:16:35,340
This probably looks better on a CRT. Oh absolutely. Just like in the movie. All right I can't look at

1040
03:16:35,340 --> 03:16:53,959
it. I can't look at it anymore. Okay so it is time to scroll. Two games that don't count

1041
03:16:53,959 --> 03:17:00,739
equals one game that counts. So all right so where are we going? We're here. We're going down

1042
03:17:01,750 --> 03:17:27,379
here which gets us to this. Like right here should be good and that should get us in a good

1043
03:17:27,379 --> 03:17:35,110
spot. Remember if there's no text on the screen it's not going to do anything.

1044
03:17:50,899 --> 03:18:14,940
What the fuck is this? So it looks like Ford Simulator 5.0. I don't know why you'd have

1045
03:18:14,940 --> 03:18:25,899
four other versions of this game but it seems like that's where you guys want to go.

1046
03:18:25,899 --> 03:18:35,879
We had some Sim Life. There's some good ones on here. There are some good ones on here.

1047
03:18:35,879 --> 03:18:55,260
You're right. All right we're gonna do Ford Simulator 5.0. Pretty good graphics for a DOS

1048
03:18:55,260 --> 03:19:15,000
game. Here comes a gigantic advertisement. This whole game is going to be an ad. Probe. Tell us.

1049
03:19:15,959 --> 03:19:29,750
Spec it. Paint it. See profile. Drive. All right spec it. Crown Victoria just picks the car.

1057
03:20:23,620 --> 03:20:29,770
How about a Mustang? Let's get a Mustang. What? I don't want that. That's what I want?

1058
03:20:29,770 --> 03:20:36,219
I want a Mustang. Paint it. Okay. Let's see what we can get with different colors.

1059
03:20:36,780 --> 03:20:56,459
I think my browser crashed. Nope. Hmm. All right. What about like Bumblebee? All right.

1060
03:20:56,459 --> 03:21:36,819
Looks good. Hey, I just painted it. Paint it. Is it painted? Canary-o-o. Drive. Uh, beginner.

1061
03:21:36,819 --> 03:21:48,090
Do you want sound? Of course I do. Choose a vehicle. Mustang. You are on the road and ready

1062
03:21:48,090 --> 03:21:57,530
to go. The objective is to get to Lake Wakatanka as fast as possible. Accelerate. Up. Okay.

1063
03:21:57,530 --> 03:22:17,500
Steer, brake, and then shift is space. Why can't I just? I'm trying to shift. Gas maps food

1064
03:22:17,500 --> 03:22:40,340
one mile. I'm so hit by a truck. Shift up. Shift into second gear. Oh god.

1065
03:22:46,090 --> 03:22:58,149
Oh god. Fifth gear. I'm 90. They're trying to. I clocked you at 32 miles per hour. Over the

1066
03:22:58,149 --> 03:23:03,770
limit. I hate to do it, but I'm going to have to write you a ticket. Uh, sorry officer.

1067
03:23:04,489 --> 03:23:30,069
I won't do it again. Have a nice day. You're gonna have to write you a ticket. Uh,

1068
03:23:30,069 --> 03:23:42,069
that's too bad. I'm only listening to instructions to get there as fast as possible.

1069
03:23:42,709 --> 03:23:46,309
It didn't say follow the rules of the road. It didn't say take your time. It said get

1070
03:23:46,309 --> 03:24:06,700
to Wakatanka as fast as possible. I'm sorry. I'm listening to instructions. I gotta go like over

1071
03:24:06,700 --> 03:24:26,739
a hundred. Come on. 98, 99, 100, 102, 105, 110, 110, 100 and fucking 20. Oh, damn it. I

1072
03:24:26,739 --> 03:24:30,739
clocked you at two miles per hour over the limit. I'm going to get a ticket for going

1073
03:24:30,739 --> 03:24:39,219
like 35 and a 30. Like a 30 what? You're going to clock me at like 32 miles per hour

1074
03:24:39,299 --> 03:24:50,389
and a 30. You were going 42 and a 40. What? You're gonna get a ticket for that?

1075
03:25:03,139 --> 03:25:10,139
Your average speed was 16 miles per hour? No, I don't want to do that again. All right,

1076
03:25:10,139 --> 03:25:23,209
I had enough. Let's go back. I don't need to do any more of this. All right, let's go again.

1077
03:25:25,639 --> 03:25:42,840
Where are we going? We've got some good ones here. Sim Life, Wheel of Fortune, Doom 2,

1078
03:25:51,700 --> 03:26:07,290
Neuromancer, Sim Earth. We seem to be split, but Sim Life I think is going to be the victor here.

1079
03:26:07,290 --> 03:26:30,520
Give it another few seconds. Five seconds left. I think we're good. 31% of the vote. That's a lot.

1080
03:26:30,520 --> 03:26:48,440
Sim Life. This is by Maxis, one of the old ones. One of the old Maxis games. All right,

1081
03:26:48,440 --> 03:27:03,819
I don't think I've ever played this before. 1992. This is not, that's not a real animal.

1082
03:27:03,819 --> 03:27:11,239
That is a snake with a grasshopper's body and bird feathers. And there's a toucan butterfly.

1083
03:27:12,200 --> 03:27:17,340
This could be good. I'm looking forward to this now. Oh, fuck, this looks like a lot.

1084
03:27:20,620 --> 03:27:25,340
Experimental mode. Do whatever you want. Craft your own plants and animals and let them loosen

1085
03:27:25,340 --> 03:27:30,620
a world of your own design. Or pick various species from the zoo to inhabit your experiment.

1086
03:27:30,620 --> 03:27:34,840
Can you establish a food chain? When will disasters strike? You play a scenario.

1087
03:27:38,200 --> 03:27:43,940
All right, let's, I wonder how hard this is. If you're new to Sim Life, why not try out the

1088
03:27:43,940 --> 03:27:48,260
tutorial? There's no particular scenario to solve. You've got the basic features of the

1089
03:27:48,260 --> 03:27:59,639
game. Okay, let's just, you know, let's just check it out. Sim Ant. Jerma lied about Minecraft

1090
03:27:59,639 --> 03:28:06,819
VR. Five community subs. Lots of community subs tonight. Thank you guys. And thank you

1091
03:28:06,819 --> 03:28:14,309
to Jerma lied about Minecraft VR for the five drop. Thank you. Welcome to Sim Life tutorial.

1092
03:28:14,309 --> 03:28:19,270
To quit the tutorial, select new game from the meta, the meta end menu. Use tutorial menu

1093
03:28:19,270 --> 03:28:22,870
to repeat a message at any time to go to the next message instead of waiting for it.

1094
03:28:23,989 --> 03:28:30,780
Okay, so just let's go. Is that my animal? Another five community subs just came in from 1914.

1095
03:28:33,860 --> 03:28:44,329
Five more subs. Thank you. Five more community subs. Fuck yeah, thank you. Sometimes I was

1096
03:28:44,329 --> 03:28:50,020
asked to click a button. I'm usually okay. Yeah, sure. All right. So day, not as a day

1097
03:28:50,020 --> 03:28:57,270
night cycle. Yeah. Okay. Can you tell me what to do? The whole days are going by.

1098
03:29:01,159 --> 03:29:08,280
More. Gnarly gave five community subs. Even more. Yeah. Now they're just coming in

1099
03:29:09,139 --> 03:29:14,969
like, okay, there's another, there's five from Gnarly, 10 from Cyclops Parker. Jesus.

1100
03:29:16,379 --> 03:29:21,540
Thank you. All of you guys for these insane amount of subs, chaining them together.

1101
03:29:23,020 --> 03:29:34,569
Thanks for the 10 Cyclops. That's fucking thank you. Here we go. There's a mutagen button. Okay.

1102
03:29:34,569 --> 03:29:39,430
Help button is right into the yellow and black mutagen button. Yeah. Dashboard, whatever.

1103
03:29:39,430 --> 03:29:42,389
It's just like, Hey, you can click help and click help and click help and click.

1104
03:29:42,389 --> 03:29:52,780
What else am I supposed to be doing? 10 more just came in from MGS fan and DJ

1105
03:29:53,590 --> 03:30:08,469
Conde. Thank you. Both of you. What is going on? I thought this is supposed to be a tutorial.

Five more from Tingy. Thank you, Tingy. Hold on. Let me just new game for a second. Hold on.

So hold on a second. Help. Terrible lizards. Let's see what it looks like.

1108
03:30:40,440 --> 03:30:43,079
Look at all these fucking community subs coming in. Oh my God.

1109
03:30:44,180 --> 03:30:51,450
10 more from JermaLightAboutMinecraftVR. Thank you for the 10 community subs.

1110
03:30:51,450 --> 03:30:55,260
So you can switch them. All right. So look at this. We can make.

1111
03:30:58,100 --> 03:31:06,520
Oh my God, guys. Five more. 10 more. Five more from Jill Crungus. Oh man. Look at this

1112
03:31:06,520 --> 03:31:23,989
thing. It's like a donkey starfish. Low intelligence herbivore. Donkey starfish

1113
03:31:23,989 --> 03:31:34,180
with a snake tail. Nating difference. This thing is called the triceratops.

1114
03:31:35,819 --> 03:31:45,700
That's not right. Food, source, plants, nectar. Okay. I feel like this is a very

1115
03:31:45,700 --> 03:31:50,950
elaborate simulation. You probably have to be here for a while. What about the other

1116
03:31:50,950 --> 03:31:57,350
animals? You guys are still going. Nat five community subs. Multi-trip five community subs.

1117
03:31:57,350 --> 03:32:05,430
You guys are still. This is like a legit sub train right now. You guys are fucking

1118
03:32:05,430 --> 03:32:14,040
going nuts. Thank you to all of you. That's like 100 community subs that just threw in

1119
03:32:14,040 --> 03:32:27,940
here right now. Thank you guys. Make it so. Let me go back out here. Tool. What is this?

1120
03:32:27,940 --> 03:32:39,370
I can mutagen. Build world. Click on any of the control names for help messages when you

1121
03:32:39,370 --> 03:32:43,290
have set parameters as you prefer. Okay. You can do like. You can make a new world.

1122
03:32:44,379 --> 03:32:52,309
Add more lakes. More. You can just change the parameters. It's interesting. Barriers,

1123
03:32:52,309 --> 03:33:04,459
mutagens, toxins. No, I don't want to do that though. Nevermind. Oh my fucking God.

1124
03:33:11,100 --> 03:33:14,860
I have nightmares about these kinds of animals. 20 community subs from Ampharic.

1125
03:33:15,579 --> 03:33:27,909
Ampharic dropping hundreds of dollars tonight. Thank you so much Ampharic. 20 more.

1126
03:33:28,549 --> 03:33:42,569

1128
03:33:53,579 --> 03:33:56,860
Anytime you guys do this shit I just can't even believe it. Thank you everybody.

1129
03:33:58,649 --> 03:34:05,620
Big Saturday subs coming in. I'll be honest. I feel like this is going to take a while

1130
03:34:05,620 --> 03:34:11,610
to like kind of do a lot of stuff. This seems kind of like sim ant where you need to

1131
03:34:11,610 --> 03:34:20,229
have like some time and just watch things grow and stuff. It seems like a fun simulation though.

1132
03:34:23,700 --> 03:34:33,930
Wait, pterodactyls? I can do sea urchins in water. Make it so. Oh shit. It seems cool but

1133
03:34:33,930 --> 03:34:40,809
might take a while to do something interesting. Yeah, this seems pretty cool. I just think I

1134
03:34:40,809 --> 03:34:42,889
feel like it would take a while for me to figure out everything that's going on.

1135
03:34:45,750 --> 03:34:51,700
But I'm going to move on from this one. It does seem very interesting but I think

1136
03:34:51,700 --> 03:34:58,440
I wouldn't want to stay here and put that much time into it. But very, very, very cool.

1137
03:34:58,920 --> 03:35:13,690
Let's come back here. Let's do it again. That was sim life.

1138
03:35:19,239 --> 03:35:35,860
A hundred percent. That's a lot for wow. Here comes the fight. Will of Fortune, Doom,

1139
03:35:36,500 --> 03:35:42,250
and Neuromancer. Do Neuromancer you normies.

1140
03:35:46,459 --> 03:36:00,299
Why? What is it? Why? All right. There's no coming back from this. 66%. There's no way.

1141
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:07,420
Will of Fortune it is. This is a DOS version of Will of Fortune. This could be

1142
03:36:08,219 --> 03:36:11,180
all over the place. It could be really good or really bad. Let's find out.

1143
03:36:17,180 --> 03:36:22,579
What is this? This is a song. Why is this some Will of Fortune?

1144
03:36:22,579 --> 03:36:33,500
Hit any key to begin. That's what I'm trying to do. Okay, here we go.

1145
03:36:33,500 --> 03:36:41,459
We of Fort. How many players? One. Are you a returning champion? No. I have to earn it.

1146
03:36:41,459 --> 03:37:04,010
Please enter your name. Okay. Round one. What do we got? It's an event. Your choice. Spin.

1147
03:37:04,010 --> 03:37:15,590
Time remaining. Spin. Spin it. I'll lose it on. All right. Enter a letter. Let's go with E.

1148
03:37:16,229 --> 03:37:28,780
Oh, fuck. You have to buy vowels. Oh, no, no. I forgot you had to buy vowels in this game.

1149
03:37:28,780 --> 03:37:42,340
And you went bankrupt, Brian. Who cares? Yeah, this sound kind of hurts. T. There's one T.

1150
03:37:42,340 --> 03:38:01,239
Something the. They the. They. Time to. It's an event. Time of the. Time of the. Turn of the

03:38:01,239 --> 03:38:34,780
century. I win. Turn of the century. I'd like to solve the puzzle, please. I win. Turn of

1152
03:38:34,780 --> 03:38:47,110
the century. I got 200 points. Round two of 200 points. Oh, yeah, I forgot. It's not about

1153
03:38:47,110 --> 03:38:55,479
winning. It's about getting letters and points. Oops. So I just look like an idiot. I'm

1154
03:38:55,479 --> 03:39:16,309
just a dickhead. Okay, this is people. Don. Chris. I don't know. I only got 200 points.

1155
03:39:16,309 --> 03:39:45,030
It's not Donald Duck. Ron. Ron. Ron. Ro. Don. Don. Ron. Donald. Ronald. There are no Bs.

1156
03:39:48,520 --> 03:40:07,860
Ronard. McDonard. Spin. I'm going to say O. O. No, it's not like Ron. It's O. Oh,

1157
03:40:07,860 --> 03:40:23,000
my God. I fucking am so stupid. I just forget the rules of this game. I've run runner.

1158
03:40:23,000 --> 03:40:32,620
Something runners. Run. Okay, I got it. It's you. Go bankrupt. No, give it to me. Give

1159
03:40:32,620 --> 03:40:39,319
it back to me. These people are stupid. U is a vowel. I'm not going to do that again.

1160
03:40:39,319 --> 03:41:08,629
It's not runners. Spin the damn wheel. P. T. T. I'm going to say T. Okay. Thomas. Tom.

1161
03:41:08,950 --> 03:41:34,329
No, there's no Os. People. Um, all right. It's all right. All right. All right. I know,

1162
03:41:34,329 --> 03:41:38,409

1163
03:41:38,409 --> 03:41:53,319
No, not Texas Ronald. Uh, I don't know. Texas. This is not people. This is a baseball team.

1164
03:41:53,319 --> 03:42:24,790
Oh, this is people. The Texas Rangers. All right, here we go. I got 1200 points. No,

1165
03:42:24,790 --> 03:42:39,579
it should have said team. This is a title. Well, it's definitely the T. It's going to

1166
03:42:39,579 --> 03:42:58,409
be a bunch of Ts. That's nice. The time of the Lord. No, it's not the Lord of the Rings, guys.

1167
03:42:58,409 --> 03:43:21,620
There's a D at the end. The word of the Lord. I think it's the word of the Lord. I think it is.

1168
03:43:21,620 --> 03:43:29,860
The word of the Lord. That's what I'm going with. That was only one D. The time of the

1169
03:43:29,860 --> 03:43:51,260
Lord. The land of the Lord. No, the work of the Lord. Why hasn't even T yet? It's free

1170
03:43:51,260 --> 03:44:05,940
points. T is actually free points. So let's see if it's the. The something of the. So H,

1171
03:44:05,940 --> 03:44:38,520
we'll do H. Let's just game those points. The. H. The. The. W. The word of the Lord. No, the,

1172
03:44:38,520 --> 03:44:54,229

It's the word of the Lord. It's the, the world. The Lord of the world. R. Already used.

1174
03:45:08,659 --> 03:45:18,860
What do you mean already used? Somebody already did R? There are no U's. I know what it is. I know

1175
03:45:18,860 --> 03:45:41,270
what it is. It's called a while. I'm not reading answers in chat. Everybody read this book in the

1193
03:51:32,299 --> 03:51:39,579
no, it's all vowels now. You have to solve it. L would be the only thing. You're not going to

1194
03:51:39,579 --> 03:51:44,729
use your free spin. All right. I'm going to go L because it's Michael. And then the rest of

1195
03:51:44,729 --> 03:51:54,540
all, it's just it's all vowels. There it is. All right. What, I get 300 points? Yeah. All

1197
03:52:04,520 --> 03:52:12,860
Uh, is it E.A.? Or A.A.E.? Is it E.A. or A.E.? Mike, yo? I don't know. Is it E.A.?

1198
03:52:12,860 --> 03:53:43,459
Oh, no. Michelle is the other way. That hurt my tummy. The category is title. There are dashes

1199
03:53:43,459 --> 03:54:42,940
here. What are the dashes for? What is this? Um, T? Something, at was two. All right. Uh,

1203
03:56:05,940 --> 03:56:11,899
over and going like, I'm just guessing. I have no idea what's happening. And that A.E.E.A.

1204
03:56:11,899 --> 03:56:24,889
thing. I, I don't, I wouldn't fuck that up too. Sorry, Pat. Better like next time.

03:58:45,420 --> 03:58:56,739

1214
03:58:56,739 --> 03:59:12,069

Now that the shoe is on the other foot. I would have had that fucking long ass time ago.

1219
04:00:39,860 --> 04:00:48,809
I just keep forgetting you have to buy the vowel. It's like, oh, would you like to buy that vowel?

1220
04:00:48,809 --> 04:01:14,229
It just deletes your turn. All right. I want the boat. This is a person. It's a person. But

1221
04:01:14,229 --> 04:01:36,790
is that the pope? Um, the. I'm not going to do T or H because I know it's the. But it might,

04:01:36,790 --> 04:01:58,340
there might be T somewhere else too. I'm going to do P. S. S. There's a lot of places

1223
04:01:58,340 --> 04:02:37,239

1228
04:04:14,969 --> 04:04:39,500
reading chat and I thought it was wrong. Yeah. I thought I just, I didn't want you to think I

1229
04:04:39,500 --> 04:04:59,340
was cheating. I'm closing chat now. I'm not even going to look at it. I'm putting you guys

1230

1234
04:07:34,780 --> 04:08:01,290

1235
04:08:01,290 --> 04:08:17,420

Somebody else did F. I didn't even fucking realize it. It's Dawn. Dawn. Oh, no. It's

1257
04:14:08,500 --> 04:14:14,629
first try like I did before and I would have read it from chat somehow. You can't play a

1258
04:14:14,629 --> 04:14:24,620
game like this. You always, I always have to be cheating. Always. Every time. I'm going to win

1259
04:14:24,620 --> 04:14:36,020
this one. Just cheat anyways since no one will ever believe you. That's true. That's a good

1260
04:14:36,020 --> 04:14:41,299
statement. I'm just going to watch the chat. No I'm not. Because I want this to be my win.

1261
04:14:41,299 --> 04:15:10,409
It's a thing. Superman. Stew. Um, something stew. Succotash. Stew. Something stew. It's a

1262
04:15:10,409 --> 04:15:19,700
food. It's like something stew. Something stop. Something stew. I went fucking bankrupt

1263
04:15:19,700 --> 04:15:36,709
again. I get it almost every time. This is a thing. Come on Nancy. Bankrupt. Lose a turn.

Something stir. Something stir. It's an eye. Stir. Suh. Something stir. Stir. Screen peeker.

1266
04:16:44,020 --> 04:16:50,149

can say anything. You can't say I'm cheating because I'm gonna do it right now. Here we go.

E. We hope you enjoy your 17 foot fishing boat. Oh man that's so fucking funny.

1272
04:18:41,000 --> 04:18:50,360
Where the hell are we? We're down here. So that was it right? That was three. Ford, Wheel of Fortune,

1273
04:18:50,360 --> 04:19:09,030
and uh Sim Life. And we have to do Doom as well. Ford sucked. Why are we doing three?

1274
04:19:09,030 --> 04:19:15,579
We do three and then we scroll. So we're gonna follow the rules guys. We're gonna follow the

1275
04:19:15,579 --> 04:19:27,799
rules. That means we're gonna scroll. Ford sucked. It didn't count. I liked Ford. Should

1276
04:19:27,799 --> 04:19:35,110
I just do like a streamer's choice and play this? The rules are dumb. Chat picks three

1277
04:19:35,110 --> 04:19:39,510
games that they want to see and then we scroll down. There's four thousand, there's four

1278
04:19:39,510 --> 04:19:47,530
thousand three hundred of these. All right I'll do, I'll, I'll do streamer's choice

1279
04:19:47,530 --> 04:20:09,430
because I'm curious what this is. Neuromancer. Load game one two one. You're at the cheap

1288
04:21:50,809 --> 04:22:08,069
Is there am I missing a function here? Disk options. What was that?

1289
04:22:08,069 --> 04:22:11,190
Holy shit. I missed some subs here. Jeremy lied about Minecraft VR. Just

1290
04:22:11,190 --> 04:22:30,069
gave a ton. Was it 20 community subs? Move along citizen. Streamers choice. Yeah

1291
04:22:30,069 --> 04:22:33,030
well everyone told me everyone would want to be to play this.

1292
04:22:33,030 --> 04:22:35,270
So I wanted to check it out because I thought it was gonna be cool. It still

1293
04:22:35,270 --> 04:22:37,510
is cool. What's wrong with this? It's nothing wrong with this.

1294
04:22:37,510 --> 04:22:48,840
What's wrong with this? It's interesting. Uh could decide by which

1295
04:22:48,840 --> 04:22:57,209
company are you employed. You're at the maximum security gate.

1296
04:22:57,209 --> 04:23:15,670
I got 5700 bucks. Is that enough? I feel like I'm missing something here.

1297
04:23:15,670 --> 04:23:27,239
Guest pass. Operate item. Guest pass? Go back over here.

1298
04:23:27,239 --> 04:23:31,719
I'm a volunteer for a Hitachi biotech. Sorry I just stumbled in here by

1299
04:23:31,719 --> 04:23:37,530
mistake. I work for. I'm a volunteer. What?

1300
04:23:37,530 --> 04:23:49,690
I have to put. Do I not know the company? I work for

1301
04:23:49,690 --> 04:24:02,709
Microsofts. All right can I talk? Apparently not. Can I go in

1302
04:24:02,709 --> 04:24:16,600
some of these buildings? Cyberspace. What's cyberspace 3?

1303
04:24:16,680 --> 04:24:24,139
Exit. Erase software. Blowtorch? No no don't erase.

1304
04:24:24,139 --> 04:24:35,959
No no no no. Operate item. Battle chess. It's a boomer open world game. It's not.

1305
04:24:35,959 --> 04:24:44,860
It every wow you got everybody so quick to be angry at these choices.

1306
04:24:44,860 --> 04:24:48,059
First it was play neuromancer and then it's get out of neuromancer and

1307
04:24:48,059 --> 04:25:06,549
then it's go in and as you get out it's which one is it.

1308
04:25:06,549 --> 04:25:09,190
All right well I can't figure out what to do so we're gonna move on.

1309
04:25:09,190 --> 04:25:15,290
Seemed like a cool game. Before everybody was extraordinarily upset that

1310
04:25:15,290 --> 04:25:35,110
I clicked it for more than four minutes. All right coming back. So that uh we're

1311
04:25:35,110 --> 04:25:48,020
gonna do a scroll. So we were here. So now we're gonna go from here down

1312
04:25:48,020 --> 04:25:56,629
to get to here. So we've got. Robocop is not up there. So this is

1313
04:25:56,629 --> 04:26:10,200
what we got here. That looks correct. Right there should be

1314
04:26:10,200 --> 04:26:15,719
good. Right there. Uh right yeah we had

1315
04:26:15,719 --> 04:26:21,020
colonization was on the last one so right there looks good. Which is hard

1316
04:26:21,020 --> 04:26:25,899
to line it up correctly. All right here we go.

1317
04:26:25,899 --> 04:26:46,149
Let's see what you guys want to do. Give it a click.

1318
04:26:46,149 --> 04:26:56,950
Wheel of fortune's not currently on the list. You can't click it. So we got

1319
04:26:56,950 --> 04:27:01,479
the incredible machine. Lemmings 3D. Big business and monkey

1320
04:27:01,479 --> 04:27:10,739
island 2. Incredible machine is the one that's

1321
04:27:10,739 --> 04:27:13,399
being picked. So that's what we're gonna do.

1322
04:27:13,399 --> 04:27:20,010
Thank you for voting. It's winning by a lot.

1323
04:27:20,010 --> 04:27:26,500
So I don't think anyone's coming back from that one. The incredible machine.

1324
04:27:32,389 --> 04:27:45,690
Oh this is what you make think of Rube Goldberg right? Original Sierra game.

1325
04:27:45,690 --> 04:27:55,639
Okay it's like mousetrap. We're gonna make let's make mousetrap.

1326
04:27:55,639 --> 04:28:02,340
Puzzle one tutorial. Put the ball in the hoop.

1327
04:28:02,340 --> 04:28:07,340
Make the basketball go through the hoop. Sure thing.

1328
04:28:07,340 --> 04:28:12,659
Okay so um let's play it. Make this is the hoop I'm assuming right? Make

1329
04:28:12,659 --> 04:28:24,899
basketball go into the hoop. So we need uh do we just place them?

1330
04:28:24,899 --> 04:28:34,840
Wait wait wait wait. What are the what are the controls here? It's a

1331
04:28:34,840 --> 04:28:45,770
ramp like this. You make this bigger? Now first of all how do I like start

1332
04:28:45,770 --> 04:28:48,809
start machine? Okay let me just see what it does already. All right so that's

1333
04:28:48,809 --> 04:28:55,129
what that does already. So like let's clear it.

1334
04:28:55,129 --> 04:29:02,090
So this has to land and like knock into this one.

1335
04:29:02,090 --> 04:29:08,360
Okay what does this one do? What is this? It's like a

1336
04:29:08,360 --> 04:29:14,899
machine? Power? What do I need power for?

1337
04:29:14,899 --> 04:29:20,139
Does it have these bands? This is to move the balls right?

1338
04:29:20,139 --> 04:29:27,850
So this is to power a generator. And then do I have to attach the

1339
04:29:27,850 --> 04:29:34,440
bands here? You know what I'm saying? Like does this is like does this I

1340
04:29:34,440 --> 04:29:40,379
I don't know what one's supposed to do. So does this like have to be

1341
04:29:40,379 --> 04:29:43,020
attached to here or something for like it to work?

1342
04:29:43,020 --> 04:30:02,180
Okay how do I turn this on? How do I power that? Oh damn okay hold on.

1343
04:30:02,180 --> 04:30:12,649
Is this for wine? So then now this has to go.

1344
04:30:12,649 --> 04:30:35,100
I have two of these. Okay so I get it. Gotta be closer.

1345
04:30:35,100 --> 04:30:41,399
No no no what the hell? Why? All right don't ever right click. So now

1346
04:30:41,399 --> 04:30:44,360
it's going to be bang. He rolls over there, bang. He rolls over there, bang and

1347
04:30:44,360 --> 04:30:46,600
that. Okay there's only difference though.

1348
04:30:46,600 --> 04:30:49,719
This is not this could be closer. How does it have to hit the top? I

1349
04:30:49,719 --> 04:31:00,469
can hit anywhere. It works. All right and then you go

1350
04:31:00,469 --> 04:31:09,690
like this. You go like this. Done. Started.

1351
04:31:09,690 --> 04:31:17,020
End of the hoop. Ding ding. New password.

1352
04:31:17,020 --> 04:31:23,100
Do you want to advance to the next puzzle and replay your solution?

1353
04:31:23,100 --> 04:31:29,750
Advance. I know I'm kind of getting the idea here.

1354
04:31:29,750 --> 04:31:33,270
All right put both bowling balls into the metal baskets.

1355
04:31:33,270 --> 04:31:37,110
To solve this puzzle you must place and flip the mouse cage

1356
04:31:37,110 --> 04:31:42,739
and then hook up the pulley belt to the conveyor belt.

1357
04:31:42,739 --> 04:31:46,680
Place and flip the mouse cage and then hook up the pulley and the

1358
04:31:46,680 --> 04:31:51,540
conveyor belt. Okay so you get these both have to go in here.

1359
04:31:51,540 --> 04:31:55,829
This one's already going. So that's that's it.

1360
04:31:55,829 --> 04:32:09,450
So now they'll both just go in right? Oh no somebody. Ah no no no. I have to drop

1361
04:32:09,450 --> 04:32:13,940
this here. This is easier than the tutorial.

1362
04:32:13,940 --> 04:32:30,790
I did it. You must pop all the balloons.

1363
04:32:30,790 --> 04:32:38,020
All right so let's just see what these do.

1364
04:32:38,020 --> 04:32:42,100
So the ball hits the you gotta blow it into the scissors.

1365
04:32:42,100 --> 04:32:58,219
Okay so we need one of these down here. Flip it and then this one's

1366
04:32:58,219 --> 04:33:01,510
got to do the same thing. Flip this one

1367
04:33:01,510 --> 04:33:04,549
because this thing can get destroyed by the

1368
04:33:04,709 --> 04:33:17,060
wheel. Tied up. Yes. Oh flip it.

1369
04:33:17,060 --> 04:33:29,380
You've achieved IQ up 68 to 69. Hey good. Hooray.

1370
04:33:29,380 --> 04:33:33,619
My IQ leveled up. That's great. Make the bowling ball fall off the bottom of

1371
04:33:33,619 --> 04:33:36,680
the screen. That's the bowling ball. What happens

1372
04:33:36,680 --> 04:33:42,180
right now? So we boink and that boinks.

1373
04:33:42,180 --> 04:33:49,369
Yeah I think I understand what you want me to do here. And then get this

1374
04:33:49,369 --> 04:34:01,779
one down here. So

1375
04:34:01,779 --> 04:34:08,819
see if that goes far. How far does the last one go? And then

1376
04:34:08,819 --> 04:34:18,090
knock that one and then do it again. Okay so this has to be flipped.

1377
04:34:18,090 --> 04:34:26,779
This looks pretty awesome though. This is good shit.

1378
04:34:26,779 --> 04:34:48,380
This is really good shit. All right let's see.

1379
04:34:48,380 --> 04:34:52,360
Oh we might be off a little bit on the physics here.

1380
04:34:52,360 --> 04:34:58,180
Maybe. No I think we're okay. And out.

1381
04:34:58,180 --> 04:35:05,220
Yeah sounds like Donkey Kong Country 3. Yeah I'm getting Donkey Kong Country

1382
04:35:05,220 --> 04:35:12,569
vibes. You're right. Use the boxing gloves to punch the

1383
04:35:12,569 --> 04:35:18,659
baseball up to the metal pipes. Punch the baseball up to the metal pipes.

1384
04:35:18,659 --> 04:35:23,139
What happens right now? This rolls. That punches.

1385
04:35:23,139 --> 04:35:30,540
So we got let's see. So we got basketball punches that ball.

1386
04:35:30,540 --> 04:35:37,290
This ball goes down here. This ball needs to be punched.

1387
04:35:37,290 --> 04:35:40,409
So actually hold on. That shouldn't. Can I move things?

1388
04:35:40,409 --> 04:35:57,139
I can't pick anything up that's already there. Can I put this here?

1389
04:35:57,139 --> 04:36:06,310
Because that drops going. I almost feel like I should put this up.

1390
04:36:06,310 --> 04:36:14,700
Should it just go up and over? What does this do?

1391
04:36:14,700 --> 04:36:30,439
No not quite. What do I do with this thing? Because it is it has to be

1392
04:36:30,439 --> 04:36:35,509
activated to punch. Yeah it has to go up over there

1393
04:36:35,509 --> 04:36:37,990
because then this has to punch this one right?

1394
04:36:37,990 --> 04:36:51,159
I hate when it does that. Can I flip this? Like

1395
04:36:51,159 --> 04:36:54,439
where can this go? No I can let go left and right.

1396
04:36:54,439 --> 04:37:11,560
So that was probably that was correct but it just needs to go higher.

1397
04:37:11,560 --> 04:37:22,580
I just learned this last puzzle. Literally one ike. I'm just like

1398
04:37:22,580 --> 04:37:28,419
yeah I just did it. But like this has to go doesn't have to go up.

1399
04:37:28,419 --> 04:37:33,459
Hold on what if I do here? Can I do it up and like over again?

1400
04:37:33,459 --> 04:37:52,040
Like what if I do this? Oh stop! Flip and then put it under the

1401
04:37:52,040 --> 04:37:58,020
black ball. I didn't think I could fit it here.

1402
04:37:58,020 --> 04:38:00,659
I tried I tried to put it here before. I didn't think I could even

1403
04:38:00,659 --> 04:38:04,549
fit it. Yeah I would have done that first.

1404
04:38:04,549 --> 04:38:12,819
It's just I didn't think it would it didn't look like it didn't fit.

1405
04:38:12,819 --> 04:38:16,099
Yeah I didn't think that was gonna fit down here. Just look at it. See the

1406
04:38:16,099 --> 04:38:19,240
white? It's like going over the I didn't

1407
04:38:19,240 --> 04:38:28,630
think that was gonna fit. All right well now I'm gonna go like

1408
04:38:28,630 --> 04:38:50,360
this. Punch the ball. Go for it. Too far.

1409
04:38:50,360 --> 04:39:06,200
Just far enough. Make Mort the mouse run in his cage!

1410
04:39:06,200 --> 04:39:23,799
Spring. I'm just doing random placement. You gotta use all four.

1411
04:39:24,630 --> 04:39:28,310
Where did it bounce to? Let's see right there.

1412
04:39:28,310 --> 04:39:55,270
Right there. Further in. Further in. Yes. Is that gonna reach? I don't think it's gonna

1413
04:39:55,270 --> 04:39:59,540
reach. Oh fuck it's not. Okay so it's gonna

1414
04:39:59,540 --> 04:40:06,659
be a little bit further. Can I move this one a little bit?

1415
04:40:06,659 --> 04:40:13,029
Each one is like one to the right.

1416
04:40:14,250 --> 04:40:23,849
Hmm not really. Lower? Now does it

1417
04:40:23,849 --> 04:40:27,819
I wonder it doesn't matter how far it falls.

1418
04:40:27,819 --> 04:40:52,040
No see I don't think steeper is gonna be better. Yeah it's definitely lower.

1419
04:40:52,040 --> 04:41:03,529
How far does it go the first time? No so there's actual physics in the game.

1420
04:41:03,529 --> 04:41:07,540
That's what I was wondering. So it will fall if the more it falls.

1421
04:41:07,540 --> 04:41:11,459
It's a DOS game. I don't think it had like actual real physics in this.

1422
04:41:11,459 --> 04:41:36,409
That should do it. All right we'll do one or two more.

1423
04:41:36,409 --> 04:41:42,060
Make the jack in the box break the fish bowl. You got it.

1424
04:41:42,060 --> 04:41:47,060
Jack in the box. Let's just see what happens right now. Okay.

1425
04:41:47,060 --> 04:41:52,869
There he goes. So we just set to make the jack in the box happen.

1426
04:41:52,869 --> 04:41:57,060
Goes up. We got two jack in the boxes here.

1427
04:41:57,060 --> 04:42:05,450
What does this do? Pretty good hand breaking here. Yeah.

1428
04:42:05,450 --> 04:42:10,150
So it just jumps up and that bounces over here which will turn

1429
04:42:10,150 --> 04:42:36,220
this. Let's see here. Oh god the right. Okay why even have a right click?

1430
04:42:36,220 --> 04:42:45,779
Oh no right here. Do it again. Spin spin spin spin spin spin spin spin

1431
04:42:45,779 --> 04:42:55,220
spin. Break the tank. We killed the fish.

1432
04:42:55,220 --> 04:43:02,709
All right a couple more. Like one or two more. That's it. Pop the balloon.

1433
04:43:02,709 --> 04:43:07,619
Note that you must flip the windmill to select which direction it turns.

1434
04:43:07,619 --> 04:43:12,259
Pop the balloon. What happens? Okay we got

1435
04:43:12,259 --> 04:43:16,549
a windmill. Are the windmills just wind?

1436
04:43:16,549 --> 04:43:21,849
Sure it is Jeremy. There's no power here though so you have to do

1437
04:43:21,849 --> 04:43:32,869
I wonder if there's a way. Wait is it can I connect this to this now?

1438
04:43:32,869 --> 04:43:36,229
Every genre. There's a lot of tracks in this game strangely enough.

1439
04:43:36,229 --> 04:43:40,900
What does this do? Do I need to place this in this particular place because

1440
04:43:40,900 --> 04:43:44,180
do I have to like hit it with something? Does it have to spin?

1441
04:43:44,180 --> 04:43:46,819
It does. Okay so you need to have the wind spin so you have to put one of

1442
04:43:46,819 --> 04:43:57,099
these down here which will spin that. You have to

1443
04:43:57,099 --> 04:44:00,580
hit it with something. So this has to go over here and then

1444
04:44:00,580 --> 04:44:08,020
push this for that to move over here. I'm generating clean energy.

1445
04:44:08,020 --> 04:44:12,599
All right well I can move this one. That doesn't really do anything.

1446
04:44:12,599 --> 04:44:20,229
Another windmill to push that all the way? Will this move?

1447
04:44:20,229 --> 04:44:28,919
Hold on a second here. Let me just do this. Can I move this one too? No

1448
04:44:28,919 --> 04:44:34,310
just that one. Because then this has to be tied to

1449
04:44:34,310 --> 04:44:38,150
this windmill right? I'm gonna bring this back over here

1450
04:44:38,150 --> 04:44:46,889
which moves it that way. So I need to flip this.

1451
04:44:46,889 --> 04:44:51,529
You go all the way over there that drops and then in the meantime

1452
04:44:51,529 --> 04:44:58,299
that will hit this windmill. Not windmill this thing.

1453
04:44:58,299 --> 04:45:04,939
Spin it that way. Attach the cord. And we should have a finished product.

1454
04:45:04,939 --> 04:45:21,619
No no we won't. Wrong way. Now it's a finished product.

1455
04:45:21,619 --> 04:45:24,580
Oh it was in the right spot at the beginning.

1456
04:45:24,580 --> 04:45:45,740
Nice. This is fun. This is a fun little game.

1457
04:45:45,740 --> 04:45:49,180
Your goal is to lower all three buckets. To do this you must cut both

1458
04:45:49,180 --> 04:45:53,369
ropes with the scissors. So we're gonna cut all the

1459
04:45:53,450 --> 04:45:57,450
ropes with the scissors. Gonna drop the buckets.

1460
04:45:57,450 --> 04:46:04,009
What happens? Just drops. Lower the buckets. Cut the rope.

1461
04:46:04,009 --> 04:46:08,729
So just out of curiosity. Will that cut if I...

1462
04:46:08,729 --> 04:46:15,139
Okay so that cuts two of them. So we need to have

1463
04:46:15,139 --> 04:46:28,060
our scissors here. Gonna cut them both so we need

1464
04:46:28,060 --> 04:46:47,159
like this. Because that'll just drop right? I think that's it.

1465
04:46:48,040 --> 04:46:51,479
You're right. Every genre of music is in the game.

1466
04:46:51,479 --> 04:46:57,419
Gun. All right. Bang. Bang. You must shoot all three guns.

1467
04:46:57,419 --> 04:47:02,540
Shoot the guns. You have to pull the... Okay that shoots.

1468
04:47:02,540 --> 04:47:12,020
So we have... You have to tie the gun to a rope.

1469
04:47:12,020 --> 04:47:23,020
Rope to something else. Bucket. I mean let's see. You gotta get this

1470
04:47:23,020 --> 04:47:26,919
to here to there and then we have one more of these. There aren't even more

1471
04:47:26,919 --> 04:47:31,380
buckets though. All right so what happens first? Oh

1472
04:47:31,380 --> 04:47:36,729
that just shoots. That's it. Hold on. Wait a minute.

1473
04:47:36,729 --> 04:47:40,409
Can I just like buck this whole thing up and just do it stupidly?

1474
04:47:40,409 --> 04:47:55,020
Too far away? I wonder if I can just do this just dumb.

1475
04:47:55,020 --> 04:48:08,380
All right you can only have one. You can go here. That should work right?

1476
04:48:08,380 --> 04:48:30,540
Something has to weigh this down. Other side. There's this balloon.

1477
04:48:30,540 --> 04:48:39,380
What's the balloon for? How do I... I want to get this back.

1478
04:48:39,380 --> 04:48:46,939
Is this enough tension to do this? On the other side?

1479
04:48:46,939 --> 04:48:52,279
There it is. Yeah! All right. I'll do like...

1480
04:48:52,279 --> 04:48:58,840
I'll do like a couple more. And then we're going to move on.

1481
04:48:58,840 --> 04:49:08,439
So this is uh turn on all the fans. You must flip the light switch to

1482
04:49:08,439 --> 04:49:13,959
provide power to the electrical plug. The initial state of all plugs is off.

1483
04:49:13,959 --> 04:49:19,319
So we have to turn on all the fans. Power is power.

1484
04:49:20,599 --> 04:49:27,959
Okay so we gotta do this. I mean we've got to bounce the ball because

1485
04:49:27,959 --> 04:49:32,299
it's turning it off. And then where does that go? A fan

1486
04:49:32,299 --> 04:49:34,459
maybe?

1487
04:49:35,580 --> 04:49:41,909
Because that's just gonna flick it on and then the fan will...

1488
04:49:41,909 --> 04:49:45,909
Well you probably... Will this blow into here?

1489
04:49:45,909 --> 04:49:56,490
What if I... I need power for this though don't I? I don't have to connect

1490
04:49:56,490 --> 04:50:16,869
these? What happens if I do this? There we go.

1491
04:50:16,869 --> 04:50:27,380
That flicks that up. That flicks that up and then the ball

1492
04:50:27,380 --> 04:50:38,569
is... gets blown. It's almost like the ball...

1493
04:50:40,060 --> 04:50:44,540
Because then this blows over here but what do I do with that?

1494
04:50:44,540 --> 04:50:55,779
The ball powers this which blows the balloon which then knocks into there.

1495
04:50:55,779 --> 04:51:01,349
Well how do I get this one to stay on? Can I just blow this

1496
04:51:01,349 --> 04:51:09,080
from here? No I can't. Maybe I can. Let's see if it'll just do it. That's

1497
04:51:09,080 --> 04:51:17,000
flicking it away. That's... Oh. I thought that was turning it off.

1498
04:51:17,000 --> 04:51:31,909
Never mind. Okay. They all started off. Yeah I know but

1499
04:51:31,909 --> 04:51:34,470
when you see it in practice it's like wait

1500
04:51:34,470 --> 04:51:44,259
shouldn't the foot switch be up? All right this is the last one

1501
04:51:44,259 --> 04:51:49,990
and then we're gonna move on. We'll do like one or two more games.

1502
04:51:49,990 --> 04:51:53,750
Make the tennis ball fall down into the pipe hole. Generous will take

1503
04:51:53,750 --> 04:52:00,569
turning motion and provide electricity. Electric motor must be plugged in to run.

1504
04:52:00,569 --> 04:52:17,189
Okay so going going so these I need more cowbell. Actually hold on don't

1505
04:52:17,189 --> 04:52:30,139
do this. Can I not move that? Can I have another fan?

1506
04:52:30,139 --> 04:52:42,860
Excuse me. Uh all right no wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.

1507
04:52:42,860 --> 04:52:53,049
Not enough. Not enough power to get that to blow this way.

1508
04:52:53,130 --> 04:53:11,270
I mean it kind of is but not really. Um windmill connected to here.

1509
04:53:11,270 --> 04:53:14,790
The thing is though I knew what what did these do again? I kind of just glazed

1510
04:53:14,790 --> 04:53:30,740
over when I was reading that. Windmill to power the generator but

1511
04:53:30,740 --> 04:53:34,459
hold on back it up. I want to read that again.

1512
04:53:34,459 --> 04:53:37,020
I like I just read it out loud without even comprehending what was

1513
04:53:37,020 --> 04:53:47,049
going on. How do I like go back? Is there a way to go back? Because

1514
04:53:47,049 --> 04:53:49,770
I just just two new items that I just

1515
04:53:49,770 --> 04:53:52,169
didn't even comprehend what they were doing.

1516
04:53:52,169 --> 04:54:10,650
I just I can't do it. Right click. Oh right. All right make the tennis ball

1517
04:54:10,650 --> 04:54:14,330
fall down. Generators will take turning motion

1518
04:54:14,330 --> 04:54:19,860
and provide electricity. The motor okay so this is a running

1519
04:54:19,860 --> 04:54:24,040
man. So this is a generator. So what the

1520
04:54:24,040 --> 04:54:33,560
hell is this? The electric motor? Which one of these is what is this is

1521
04:54:33,560 --> 04:54:43,740
a motor now? Full Jupiter. That's pretty good.

1522
04:54:43,740 --> 04:54:53,099
All right so this is this one is powered already.

1523
04:54:53,099 --> 04:55:04,169
So I don't need this because it's plugged in. How do so will this spin?

1524
04:55:04,169 --> 04:55:08,889
That spins this. Does this need to be do I actually need to

1525
04:55:08,889 --> 04:55:15,159
connect this? This movement the windmill turns from here

1526
04:55:15,159 --> 04:55:25,639
which in turn will that turn? No. All right get this off

1527
04:55:25,639 --> 04:55:33,720
because then that probably okay now this will power that which then will

1528
04:55:33,720 --> 04:55:37,849
power the

1529
04:55:37,849 --> 04:55:59,159
this. What is this thing for? This powers the switch.

1530
04:55:59,159 --> 04:56:03,479
Does this need to be plugged in? What does this thing do?

1531
04:56:03,479 --> 04:56:10,650
What's the other fan for? The ball the ball needs to be

1532
04:56:10,650 --> 04:56:22,259
because now this is powered. So that's a generator and then this is

1533
04:56:22,259 --> 04:56:29,700
now has power for me to attach to this which will then knock

1534
04:56:29,779 --> 04:56:41,189
oh it's gotta be the other way then hits that which then bounces

1535
04:56:41,189 --> 04:56:56,549
okay so then this this goes over here and how do I power that? The rat runs

1536
04:56:56,549 --> 04:57:01,459
but just can i power i can't power the fan with the rat can i

1537
04:57:01,459 --> 04:57:38,680
no i can't put that up there and this needs to be near a switch

1538
04:57:38,680 --> 04:57:45,930
oh this comes with a plug i didn't think this came with a plug

1539
04:57:45,930 --> 04:57:49,049
i thought you just had to pump it in okay well that makes it

1540
04:57:49,049 --> 04:58:15,159
that's all right okay over here that was fun

1541
04:58:15,159 --> 04:58:26,119
did it hooray all right that's it that's it for bad rats the prequel

1542
04:58:26,119 --> 04:58:33,180
i just uh for some i didn't think there was gonna be an outlet attached

1543
04:58:33,180 --> 04:58:36,619
all right we are gonna do uh one more

1544
04:58:36,619 --> 04:58:53,669
compare this to bad rats i mean it's just i was kidding

1545
04:58:53,669 --> 04:59:00,180
let's go over here all right let's do we have

1546
04:59:00,180 --> 04:59:07,139
what was that the first one so we probably two more then because that was

1547
04:59:07,139 --> 04:59:12,810
the first one in that list so we'll do two more

1548
04:59:12,810 --> 04:59:16,169
that should take us to about six hours

1549
04:59:16,169 --> 04:59:25,000
which is where i was probably gonna end in any way so

1550
04:59:25,000 --> 04:59:35,610
all right here we go that was the incredible machine that was fun

1551
04:59:35,610 --> 04:59:41,180

05:09:33,369 --> 05:09:36,330
you just have to have each one of the lemming classes do something to

1616
05:09:36,330 --> 05:09:40,759

05:31:04,119 --> 05:31:06,200
gotta figure out what's going on here because of my colonoscopy let's see

1774
05:31:06,200 --> 05:31:09,299
what's going on the remaster was bad yeah i remember

1775
05:31:09,299 --> 05:31:16,810
they kind of redid it let me just hold on i gotta look at a

1776
05:31:16,810 --> 05:31:23,900
calendar this saturday so we did we went thursday friday

1777
05:31:23,900 --> 05:31:26,700
saturday i have i need to take three days

1778
05:31:26,700 --> 05:31:35,959
off from my colonoscopy let you know it was his will do

1779
05:31:35,959 --> 05:31:39,799
so this exactly one week from today is

1780
05:31:39,799 --> 05:31:44,759
my appointment the day before i can't do anything

1781
05:31:44,759 --> 05:31:48,599
and maybe potentially it depends on how i feel about the day after it should be

1782
05:31:48,599 --> 05:31:51,159
okay but at least friday and saturday i won't

1783
05:31:51,159 --> 05:31:54,939
be live so what we'll probably end up doing

1784
05:31:54,939 --> 05:32:02,599
here is i'll come back on

1785
05:32:02,599 --> 05:32:06,520
we'll do tuesday wednesday thursday and then

1786
05:32:06,520 --> 05:32:17,979
probably sunday that sounds about right but i just need to look at it

1787
05:32:17,979 --> 05:32:20,060
on a calendar tuesday because then they'll give me

1788
05:32:20,060 --> 05:32:27,880
the day there so tuesday i can tell you exactly what

1789
05:32:27,880 --> 05:32:30,919
we're doing tuesday we're gonna finish sam and max

1790
05:32:30,919 --> 05:32:34,490
we'll at least try to get you know a couple episodes in because i was

1791
05:32:34,490 --> 05:32:37,590
supposed to do it yesterday and the day before but it

1792
05:32:37,590 --> 05:32:40,950
all the internet bullshit stopped it from happening that was really the

1793
05:32:40,950 --> 05:32:50,939
start up when it got real bad and then wednesday and thursday

1794
05:32:50,939 --> 05:33:03,299
maybe i'll maybe i'll play my magic now i'm really into that

1795
05:33:03,299 --> 05:33:13,479
those of you that don't know what it is it's really interesting

1796
05:33:13,479 --> 05:33:17,659
yeah so then yeah we'll do tuesday wednesday thursday sunday

1797
05:33:17,659 --> 05:33:25,240
that's probably what's gonna happen all right let me zoom back in here because i

1798
05:33:25,240 --> 05:33:29,479
was gonna go tomorrow too but i feel like that taking the days off

1799
05:33:29,479 --> 05:33:35,159
would because then i would be that would be four days in a row

1800
05:33:35,159 --> 05:33:38,490
and that's what i but then the fucking shit next weekend and then

1801
05:33:38,490 --> 05:33:41,290
all the internet bullshit i think that plays out better doing it here

1802
05:33:41,290 --> 05:33:46,250

05:36:02,139 --> 05:36:12,060
you too i will see you guys again on what we're

1822
05:36:12,060 --> 05:36:21,529
doing here right tuesday right tuesday wednesday thursday

1823
05:36:21,529 --> 05:36:31,819
that sounds about right that sounds right to me

1824
05:36:31,819 --> 05:36:43,990
next time on dragon ball z somebody in chat just said that

1825
05:36:43,990 --> 05:36:54,180
let me get this up here sounds good what how long has this been on for

1826
05:36:54,180 --> 05:37:02,619
no not for did i just turn it back on hopefully i don't flake out on sam

1827
05:37:02,619 --> 05:37:07,080
and max no i i won't i i wouldn't have the only reason why it happened is

1828
05:37:07,080 --> 05:37:10,279
because the internet was so bad i just couldn't even stream it

1829
05:37:10,279 --> 05:37:13,799
and i'm not i don't want to power through a game like that that

1830
05:37:13,799 --> 05:37:19,939
requires you know tons of dialogue tons of choices tons of things to pay

1831
05:37:19,939 --> 05:37:22,340
attention to and it you know the internet just drops to

1832
05:37:22,340 --> 05:37:28,220
fucking zero and i'm gonna be honest with you here

1833
05:37:28,220 --> 05:37:32,220
the internet problem is gonna be a potential long-term issue

1834
05:37:32,299 --> 05:37:39,259
for a while because it's just at the point right now with us changing to a

1835
05:37:39,259 --> 05:37:42,040
few things and then doing something we're at

1836
05:37:42,040 --> 05:37:46,939
uh 9,300 drop frames in about six hours

1837
05:37:46,939 --> 05:37:52,740
which is that's not unbearable but it's not good

1838
05:37:52,740 --> 05:37:56,360
we're just barely at that level where it's not

1839
05:37:56,360 --> 05:38:05,299
unwatchable and hopefully i mean what we're hoping is

1840
05:38:05,299 --> 05:38:09,540
that we get through this couple weeks of just terrible internet for some

1841
05:38:09,540 --> 05:38:14,119
reason or they actually do catch one of the

1842
05:38:14,119 --> 05:38:22,860
noise problems or packet problems whatever it is and they get it fixed

1843
05:38:22,860 --> 05:38:27,209
so you know we probably gonna have to just deal with

1844
05:38:27,209 --> 05:38:36,009
one percent two percent potentially drop frames probably for a little while

1845
05:38:36,009 --> 05:38:38,569
lol

1846
05:38:40,599 --> 05:38:45,720
oh that's all those call of duty players no that's all good

1847
05:38:45,720 --> 05:38:50,680
