1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,019
You're gonna have to step on the gas if you want to get this guy. Yeah, he's right there.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,320
Yeah, see he's right here, I told you.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
I landed right next to me.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,320
Just wait, wait, wait.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,000
Oh, we're here from the afterlife. We're here to kill you.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're gonna kill you.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, take this important advice from us before we go.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A raincoat is usually helpful when it's raining. He didn't even get to hear my tip.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,649
It's almost impossible to roleplay in GTA V.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,950
See, I'm trying to pretend I'm like a firefighter trying to make an honest living.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,950
Putting out fires, saving cats.

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,950
And these two are just being like dickheads, shooting everybody and shooting each other.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,950
Can I even, I'm gonna spray the hell out of these guys.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,950
Yeah, that's not, you know, the roleplayers are fighting back.

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,189
I'll spray the hell out of you.

16
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,189
You can never stop my power of imagination.

17
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,189
I will imagine myself as a firefighter.

18
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:02,189
You'll take your machine guns and shove them up your ass, alright?

19
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,189
Shove them up your ass!

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,000
When this guy comes back from being paused, I am going to fucking destroy him.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm gonna stick this knife right, don't fuck this up.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,560
Oh my god, this guy, please.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Are you gonna do what I'm doing to him to me? Please don't do this.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
This is a great opportunity.

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Okay, he's not. I think he's gonna help me.

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,560
Good. Alright, we're both, he takes it like the billy club.

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
No! You!

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,689
You know, Tim, we really should go to that restaurant.

29
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,689
We keep forgetting to go to it.

30
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,689
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

31
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:33,689
We don't touch a police car.

32
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,689
Tim, get out of the car. We got a 506 situation here.

33
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:36,989
I'm the bad cop. I'm gonna get you.

34
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:37,989
Shoot these two assholes!

35
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:39,989
Got one of them. Good job, Tim.

36
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,989
I don't know who I am.

37
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,989
I never knew who you were. Get out of my fucking face.

38
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:46,989
I'm just gonna go this way.

39
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:48,989
I don't know whose car that is, but

40
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:50,989
I really should probably go to a fucking doctor.

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,310
Fuck. What?

42
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,739
Where did you even come from?

43
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,109
You are out of your goddamn mind.

44
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:08,039
Come on. Come on, then.

45
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,039
Come on.

46
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,840
I feel like the old fat guy that ran Jurassic Park.

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Remember when like the velociraptors coming out of the egg?

48
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:23,219
Okay, so I just went to go get a drink

49
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,219
and came back.

50
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,219
And this is, this is what's happening right now.

51
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:30,590
I have no fucking idea what's going on.

52
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,590
Oh, was I in like a cop car?

53
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,590
How am I still alive?

54
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,590
I was gone for at least like two or three minutes.

55
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,590
These guys have still not killed me.

56
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,590
And there's like nine cruisers and like a helicopter right here.

57
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,669
You serious right now?

58
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,669
I'm gonna slow this down because it's like just absolutely fucking ridiculous.

59
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:53,669
Like this guy flies out of a gingerbread man car.

60
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:55,669
He looks like a gingerbread man.

61
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,669
So that's what I figured. It was a gingerbread man car.

62
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,669
And that's the end of the clip.

63
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:03,419
Welcome to the end.

64
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:05,419
Billy told me I was an idiot.

65
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,419
No, I didn't.

66
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,419
Yes, he did.

67
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,419
No, you're an idiot.

68
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,419
No, you're an idiot.

69
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:10,419
Mom.

70
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,419
Mom, he told me.

71
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,419
Shut up.

72
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,419
Hi, I'm the third child.

73
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,419
I do a lot of bad things.

74
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,719
Do you expect me to come and hit them?

75
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,039
No.

76
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,039
I can't believe how much blood is all over me.

77
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,280
I look like a clown.

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,280
It looks like I'm in a clown suit.

79
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm in a clown costume.

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Because of this blood.

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Hey kids, it's me, Bozo the Clown.

82
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Happy birthday, I murdered your family.
