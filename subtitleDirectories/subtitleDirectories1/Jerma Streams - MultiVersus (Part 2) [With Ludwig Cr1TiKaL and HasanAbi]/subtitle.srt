1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,580
Alright, let me make sure the stuff for the sponsor segment is ready.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:17,370
By the way, oh, I gotta think of a good title. What should I title this? What should I title this?

3
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:34,149
There are drops gonna be on, by the way. If you want to potentially get access to multiverses,

4
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:48,649
by the way, the open beta, I believe is the 26th, do an apology video for being wrong about Ant-Man.

5
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:57,020
I already said I'm sorry. I already apologized. Alright, let's go. I gotta change the title to

6
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,979
something. What? I gotta think of a good, give me a good grabbable title. Something that I can,

7
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:13,900
something that's gonna grab people. You know what I mean? Let me make sure that's there. Hey,

8
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:21,079
can you guys confirm that the images in the bottom of the stream? Yeah, there it is. Alright, cool.

9
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:34,060
It's there. This should be a chat bot too. I can't believe you rides bugs. I never, I can't believe

10
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:55,659
it. Alright, so I cannot wait. I didn't practice that much off stream, by the way, but I will do

11
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:10,389
my best. Title, what's a good title? Multiverses. Okay, give me one more second. Rating the best

12
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:15,349
bugs and being the best bugs bunny player later. Oh, that's not gonna work. Alright, how about,

13
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,770
I can put my camera back on so you guys don't all freak out. That's better. Okay, how about,

14
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,969
how about, let's go for it. What do I put here? I don't know what to do. What, what's a good,

15
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:57,610
I need to get a good title. How about bugs in it up? How about bugging out? No, bugs Andy. Alright,

16
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:08,069
how about, let's go with, what should I do for, I gotta think, I have to think of a good title

17
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:22,150
in the next 10 seconds. Okay, how about, we'll just do back in the multi, back in multiverses.

18
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:43,990
Let's go. That sucks. Back, back in multiverses, bugs Andy. No, back in multiverses. Bugs, bugs,

19
00:03:43,990 --> 00:04:03,419
bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. That's good. How about I say drops enabled as well. That looks good. Alright,

20
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:11,430
let's fucking freaking go. Let's freaking go. Let's freaking go. Let's freaking go.

21
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,259
I don't think that's a problem. I don't think that's a problem.

22
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:35,240
Are you guys ready? Why's my face came so huge? Alright. Alright, I'm ready. Don't quit. We're

23
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:47,240
gonna do teams. I practiced a tiny bit. This is a sponsored stream by the way. Wait, what cross

24
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,600
platform? Yeah, that's fine. I'm so ready for this. But thank you. Thank you to Warner Brothers

25
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,110
Interactive. Seriously, sponsoring the stream. Drops are enabled. If you have drops on,

26
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:08,379
keep it on. If you watch for an hour, that's how you get access to the game.

27
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:20,699
By the skin? This is by the way, this is why I love this shit. Cross platform, cross progression,

28
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:28,899
PC, Xbox, PlayStation. You can play with each other. You can cross progression. It's fucking

29
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:38,439
awesome. Am I going? Oh, yeah. Let's go. Operation rabbit. Yeah, mods. Keep it on the bot.

30
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:48,139
There should be a chat bot. Yeah, I have drops enabled right now. Alright, me and Steven Universe

31
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:55,050
versus Shaggy and Garnet. I don't I think I'm level one. So all progression will carry over

32
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:08,709
by the way. Yes, it will. I don't think I think you guys are not. I think you guys are not ready

33
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:15,459
for how well I'm thinking I'm going to do here. Check it out. Oh, by the way, what's that? Oh,

34
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:26,870
excuse me. Bingo. That's right. Take a look at that. I thought it was the other character

35
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:58,379
for a second. I got to remember the controls and everything. All right. Keep it together. Keep

36
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:17,939
it together. We got it. We got it. Oh, it's gonna be a double. See you later. Come on. Come on,

37
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:48,410
Steve. Come on, Steve. I'm going under, going under, going under. Do it. Yeah, I see. What is

38
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:57,579
that? It's all good. We're good. We're good. We got the advantage. We're good. Nice job, Steve.

39
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:14,139
Damn, this might hurt. I'm all right. Sorry. I have to probably just peek the mic.

40
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:44,059
Multi-versus. Open beta on July 26th. Where are you? That was weird. Drop it.

41
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:08,919
See you. That's it, right? Trevor, you can't play video games.

42
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:21,289
Gee, you stinker. I got to tell you something. Let's go. I said this before. I'm going to say

43
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:34,179
it again. The net code in this game is unbelievable. It feels fantastic to play this game. You heard me

44
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:46,440
say this already. Everything feels one to one. One to one. A lot of times when I've ever tried

45
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:54,279
to play a fighting game like this or anything like this, hitting X and waiting 0.3 seconds

46
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:03,370
X. X. I can't do it. The net code is amazing. I don't know what they did or how they did it,

47
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:15,539
but seriously, it's so good. Yeah, no, that's it. That is my honest to goodness opinion.

48
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:27,820
Rollback net code. Yeah. And man, it's good. So from my understanding, I didn't know this before,

49
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:35,799
this game is supposed to be played with teams. Each character has, from my understanding,

50
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:50,149
different party moves. It's not really designed for 1v1. I guess it is, but I'm not surprised how

51
00:10:50,149 --> 00:11:00,299
good the net code is. I'm not surprised. I played this already. Remember when I got cut off and I

52
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:49,879
wanted to play it so bad? Let's go up two for two. Here we go. Give me that shield. I don't know what

53
00:11:49,879 --> 00:12:23,029
just happened. Sorry. We're good. We're good. We're good. Just pull it together. Pull it together.

54
00:12:23,029 --> 00:13:04,679
Get two kills here. Don't let him do that. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.

55
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:55,960
Team. Give me some. Give me some. Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.

56
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:26,250
That's huge. Pull it together. Make it happen. Get these two kills and we're good.

57
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:56,340
Don't let them get away. This guy just bouncing around. Just get rid of them.

58
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:10,759
Whew. All right. That was a little sloppy. That was a little sloppy, but I'll take it.

59
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:24,039
That was a little sloppy. Should I try the new silent streamer? Dude, I'm just cranking out the

60
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:44,539
game. Do a backflip? Wait, I gotta tweet. Let's go. Tweet out. I had to warm up. I had to warm up a

61
00:15:44,539 --> 00:16:00,330
little. So are you guys getting drops? Does it work? You have to watch for an hour? Okay. Just

62
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,590
want to make sure it works. All right. This is the new character. This is an iron giant.

63
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:23,690
Should I just get my ass kicked with iron giant? Is he any good? He's whoa. Okay. I'll try it.

64
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,490
I'm so, I'm so excited, man. I, you know, I've been waiting to play a game like this.

65
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,139
So I, I'm going to let my Batman down here. I have no idea what the moves are.

66
00:16:46,139 --> 00:17:02,059
I don't have a single clue. You're going to make, yeah, you gotta,

67
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:04,779
you gotta make a WB games account and then link your Twitch to it.

68
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:15,420
You can't keep doing this. All right. Let's see. What do you got? These eats. What does he eat?

69
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:39,930
He's huge. I think I'm doing okay. What's a grab? I'm just like in the way. Oh my God. This guy is

70
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:55,130
cracked. He's got a big butt storm. Protect friend. What's that mean? I think I have a defense move.

71
00:17:55,849 --> 00:18:02,250
Whoa. It's like, I do have two different forms. All right. I gotta go look this up. I gotta go in

72
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:34,900
the lab. I just like big booted drop. We're still good. What does it down? What is up?

73
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:43,400
What just happened? I have no idea what I just did, but that guy was trapped.

74
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:52,089
I hit the guy with like a hundred frames frame data.

75
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:12,309
Shit. Sorry. So this is a colossal character. It's the first one that that makes sense.

76
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:24,779
He's really slow. I like that move. The big right hand.

77
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:37,740
Reagan hurts, you know. What does the side special do? I've got the giant.

78
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:50,220
I think the side special is a grab. I have like a power up. I can protect the friend. He's really

79
00:19:50,220 --> 00:20:09,000
good. Let's do that again. I guess so. I'll do it. He can fight. Well, is iron giant technically

80
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:20,140
fighting? He's like punching cars and stuff, right? I don't know. Should I do bugs? All right. I want

81
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:33,160
to level up bugs money. If you say so, I got to find out the scenario to use some of his moves

82
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:41,619
because the bugs is cool, but he's got a lot of cool downs. You're playing the little brother.

83
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,700
Well, guess what? Man, the little brother has not lost a match since starting.

84
00:20:50,440 --> 00:21:00,460
This is, this is fun. This is fun. I'll do some one V ones after this.

85
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:26,779
That was a good stun right to start it. Be careful. Don't get too trapped over there.

86
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:59,779
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wrong move. Oh my, I almost hit him with the end of that rocket.

87
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:33,660
Hit him, hit him, hit him, hit him, hit him. Ooh, nice. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

88
00:22:43,220 --> 00:23:03,910
Knock it over there. Yep. Denial area denial. Getting sloppy. No, we pulled it back. We pulled

89
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:15,500
it back. Bugs has an amazing up air. That bat swinging the bat up is awesome. By the way,

90
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:37,289
this game is going to be free to play. It's free to play. Buy an announcer pack. Okay. I kind of

91
00:23:37,289 --> 00:24:04,500
want to take the iron giant into the lab. Should I take that? I want to learn how to do it. Let me

92
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:18,089
go back. I want to see, because I don't want to just press buttons. Okay. So that's his charge

93
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:26,539
move. That looks cool. What's the combo? The combo is just the smash, smash, butt bounce. Okay.

94
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:32,420
What about up air? I mean up. All right. So that's what I was doing. He actually throws something.

95
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,400
You can. All right. The projectile can be the longer you hold it. Oh, that's annoying.

96
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:49,509
That's going to be so annoying. You just be an annoying shithead here. Okay. So that's what

97
00:24:49,509 --> 00:25:00,599
that does. What about down? So down attack makes these bolts that you eat. And what after how many

98
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:13,930
Okay. You have max of five bolts. What are the bolts do? Let's find out. Okay. So that's that.

99
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,450
All right. What is the standard? What does this do? So that's the grab was a grab. That's it.

100
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:25,140
He just kind of grabs. All right. I just used bolts. Oh, it's a shield. I get it.

101
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:39,079
Bro. You probably do it again, bro. Why is the computer fighting back? Okay. That's what you

102
00:25:39,079 --> 00:26:02,329
want to do. It's up and X. Okay. So that's yeah, I can pick where this goes. Okay. All right. That's

103
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:06,089
why I was having trouble figuring out what that was doing. If you just do it in the air, you go

104
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:14,890
straight down. All right. And if you that's obviously dodge. Okay. So what about what is

105
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:24,220
the standard standard? Special is just is it hurt? No, I think it's just shield is the grab

106
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:39,619
the butt stomp is up special. Okay. I think that uses a bolt. Do I fly with this? Okay. All right.

107
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:48,119
Doesn't seem that complicated. I have a better idea what's happening. Protect friends. Yeah,

108
00:26:48,119 --> 00:27:05,720
what is this? This is a whole new move set now. Okay, that's awesome. How did I get that to happen?

109
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:20,869
I think it is build a meter. Yeah, it's a meter you build. I can aim that kind of like a like a

110
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:40,170
helicopter blade. All right, I think I get it. Let's do it. Let's do it in the game. Does

111
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:48,200
exclamation point drops do anything? I don't think that does anything. I don't think that does

112
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,009
anything. Why is everybody doing that? Oh, it Okay, people are just spamming. I get it. Okay.

113
00:27:55,579 --> 00:28:07,559
That doesn't do anything. What was I was? Where's my? Let me see. Okay, we're good.

114
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:15,190
I'm gonna try to play another game with iron giant. I think I have some currency too.

115
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:31,589
All right, teams again, let me let me do some one v ones free for all. Okay, I'm gonna do one v one.

116
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:41,220
Let's see how badly I get my ass kicked. Choose your character. Should I do? I'm not confident

117
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:58,329
with iron giant. But whatever, I'll get beat up. Classic. You're like a child on Christmas morning.

118
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:06,039
I've been waiting to get back into this for at least a month or two since it was last year.

119
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:22,549
I'm so excited. Iron giant is a good movie. Iron giant is a good movie. I agree. All right,

120
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:27,109
Harley Quinn. Prepare yourself. I'll see how annoying I can be with this character.

121
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:41,819
Oh, let's do it. All right, I gotta walk in for this one. Two ring outs.

122
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,849
We'll go for one right off the bat immediately. I'm gonna go for a crazy play here. Watch this.

123
00:29:46,890 --> 00:30:09,160
What's on me? I got like a bomb on me.

124
00:30:54,569 --> 00:31:07,880
Sorry. Sorry. I'm getting styled on right now. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

125
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:42,099
I got to learn how to do some of these moves.

126
00:31:52,339 --> 00:32:00,220
Continue. No, that was a good fight. That said, that second heat there,

127
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,819
I got absolutely styled on. That was R. I got destroyed. You didn't use your shield one time.

128
00:32:12,069 --> 00:32:24,500
Should I do Taz? No, we'll go 1v1 bucks. The earwig in your brain is getting to you right now.

129
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:34,740
Do a Taz impression. No, no, no. Sponsor stream. Whatever. Why not?

130
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,380
I was just about to... Okay, that Taz mania was just about to do that.

131
00:32:54,339 --> 00:33:04,660
Somebody hit man style, like put a piano wire around his neck. What was that? What was that?

132
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:18,619
I was like... All right, let's go. Main versus main. You got your Harley Quinn. I've got my bucks.

133
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:33,750
Oh, best out of three. Let's do it. Both earbuds in. I'm going hard here.

134
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,579
I figured she was gonna jump over me. So I was like, you know what? I'm gonna keep up a

135
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:59,369
fall on the other direction. Figured that was gonna happen. Good job. Good fight. Good fight.

136
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:22,619
Okay. Read like a book. I almost did my starter mission, guys. Why did you take your smart pills

137
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:37,030
today? I think a lot of you might be concerned that I like a video game and I might be kind of

138
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:58,010
good at it. I'm really not, though. I'm just excited. All right, Superman's good. Oh wait,

139
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:10,329
I have perks, don't I? Can I put them on right here? You ate your Flintstone vitamins?

140
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:24,090
I mean, I had vitamins today. Maybe that helps. You're getting carried so hard by the earwig.

141
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:49,690
The earwig is in control right now. I don't know what happened there. That was weird.

142
00:36:50,250 --> 00:37:54,179
Thought he was gonna jump. Oh, shit. He's bringing it back. Oh, what? Nice recovery. Holy smokes.

143
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:57,849
I forgot how to play video game. I forgot how to play it. I forgot how to play it. I'm all right.

144
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:44,099
I'm good. I'm good. I forgot how to play. I forgot how to play. I forgot how to play the game.

145
00:38:44,820 --> 00:39:48,860
I didn't want to taunt. What? What the hell are you doing? What happened? All right.

146
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:54,309
I got to dig down into... That was a good fight. Let's do it again.

147
00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:08,300
Paid actor. Paid actor. He probably dropped his controller on the ground.

148
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,780
Whoever that is, they're probably screaming because they had me. They had me right where

149
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,380
they wanted me and they probably dropped their controller and it probably smashed on the ground

150
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:30,059
and they grabbed it really quick. All right. I have to stick with bugs. This guy's got a pretty

151
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:50,380
good Superman. All right. Hold on. Wait. I guess I'll just put these on, right? Till I have paid

152
00:40:50,380 --> 00:41:06,170
actor. The mods are having a lot of fun over here. They're saying the other guy's earwig died. Same

153
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:14,199
person. Yeah, that was a good match. All right. Let's go. I got my coffee. I got my controller.

154
00:41:43,449 --> 00:42:33,860
I forgot how to play the game. What's happening? My earwig is fucking having trouble. My earwig is

155
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,460
pressing a bunch of buttons in my brain. Stop pressing the button that wants me to go get a

156
00:42:37,460 --> 00:43:55,340
pizza. Didn't taunt. Good grab. Good grab. Good grab. Good grab. Good grab. Sorry.

157
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:15,369
Why is he playing with his whole body? Because I'm in the game. Paid earwig.

158
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:33,429
Lightning's going through my body. No, it's not paid earwig. I'm sorry I keep screaming too,

159
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:42,340
by the way. By the way, connect your WB account to your Twitch. If you watch here,

160
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:50,250
you got to watch for an hour. Be an active participant. The actual, the open beta is July

161
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:59,909
26th, by the way. PlayStation. I was holding that in for like 10 straight seconds.

162
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,280
It's on PlayStation. It's on Xbox. It's on PC.

163
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,860
Easy does it, old sport.

164
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,179
My earwig in my brain right now. He's just like, he's covered in sweat.

165
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:36,920
Yeah, exclamation point drops doesn't do anything. Oh, this is Ari Stark. I just want to make sure

166
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,920
everyone's aware of this. I've not lost a match yet the whole time I've been screaming in this game.

167
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:47,780
We are undefeated. I mean, yeah, we're in, we're in like the first 10 levels, but whatever.

168
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,719
Earwig Mom said it's my turn to play the Xbox. No, it's not.

169
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:41,480
Dammit. Whoa, are you serious? Bugs Bunny talking smack about Game of Thrones? You kidding me?

170
00:46:41,480 --> 00:47:15,099
Best character in the game. Good dodge. Shoot it up.

171
00:47:42,300 --> 00:48:02,010
I did that on purpose. I did that. I did. I did that on purpose.

172
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:05,190
Pretended to freak out every time I fall off the edge.

173
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,699
Show us the controller. We don't believe it's you. Oh, I got it in my hand.

174
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:24,380
What do you mean? I'm playing. Easy does it, old sport.

175
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:34,420
God. Okay. Playing fighting games online. I have to be very honest. I'm going to be

176
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:43,750
incredibly upfront and very honest. There's not been one match, one single match this whole time

177
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:59,400
that has felt off. This is a breath of fresh air. It truly is. It's been like 10 to 15 matches.

178
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:56,230
No input delay. God. I've been waiting for a decade for this. Didn't expect that.

179
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:03,610
That combo. Holy shit. Oh my God. Good player. Good player. Very good player.

180
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:48,780
I can still do it. I guess I still got it.

181
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:41,030
Damn. Oh, good. Good. Good. Oh, that was clean at the end there.

182
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:49,769
That was a good fight. That was a good fight. I slipped up a few times there. Slipped up a few.

183
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:57,880
Let's do it again. Let's do it again. He's going to get, he's holding back toxic Andy.

184
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:08,650
Toxic. What are you talking about? Choose your character. I unplugged my controller.

185
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:15,429
What do you mean toxic? Every time I got a move done to me, that was good. I'm like, good move.

186
00:53:15,429 --> 00:53:22,329
Oh, great. A great throw. Prepare for my deftifying exploits.

187
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:33,050
All right. Let's try that again. That was intense. My, my blood is on fire right now.

188
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:54,500
All right. I pull it back. Let's go. Prepare yourself. All right. It's so fun. All right.

189
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,099
We got best of three here.

190
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:52,260
Face stolen. What the hell happened? Give me that. Give me that. Give me that. Don't let you have

191
00:54:52,260 --> 00:56:21,190
that. Oh, all right. All right. 45, 45, 45, 45. There it is. Good fight.

192
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:26,789
All right. My dog keeps farting and I'm going to throw up. Please win this match.

193
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:34,300
All right. I just, I did. I'll just leave the room, dude. Why are you still there?

194
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:41,510
Just open up your door and walk out and just watch from the hallway.

195
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:12,650
You want the, no, the dog just check DMS. What? What happened? I have an ant man shirt.

196
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:29,380
Wait, what? Wait, check like my Twitter DMS. I don't have it. Oh, I do have a Twitter.

197
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:47,019
Jerma wanna play. It's Hassan. You want to play? I mean, I, I, I got a pretty mean bugs bunny.

198
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:52,940
Easy does it old sport. I got a Hassan DM to me on Twitter. He's like, hey, let's go. Let's

199
00:57:52,940 --> 00:58:06,380
fucking play. All right. Let me, let me do a few more cracked out games. I don't even know how to

200
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:21,750
add somebody. Could you add them in like the WB account thing? Another Harley Quinn.

201
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:26,579
Prepare yourself. It's probably on the main menu.

202
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:35,289
Hassan, do you want a one V one or do you want a two V two? What do you want to do?

203
00:58:35,289 --> 00:59:19,780
I hope this match is televised. All right. I'll pull it together here. Hello. Oh, give me this

204
00:59:19,780 --> 01:00:31,139
bomb. What lap is this? Oh shit. I'm gamer fatigue is setting in gamer. I got, I got gamer fatigue.

205
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:44,789
Hold on. All right. Pull it together. Pull it together. Pull it together. Let's go.

206
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:01,449
It's a hundred degrees in here. It's a hundred degrees in this room. It's a hundred degrees in

207
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:25,769
here. Oh, how do I toast? Dude, did smoke just come out of his ears? That's the second Harley

208
01:02:25,769 --> 01:02:36,280
Quinn that's kicked my ass. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. This, I love this dude.

209
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:41,769
Did smoke just come out of his ears? They beat you. I know I got, I, my air game has got to be

210
01:02:41,769 --> 01:03:01,059
better. Ear wig overheating. Choose your character. It's a hundred degrees Kelvin. All right. Let me

211
01:03:01,059 --> 01:03:05,699
do one more and then what, what, let me, let me, let me DM Hassan and see what he wants to do.

212
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:31,369
You want a one V one bro or two V two. Oh, I actually wrote, I actually said bro. Oops. All

213
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:35,800
right. I gotta, I gotta, we gotta go back to the basics here. Tasmanian Delta. I don't even know

214
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:57,800
how to play. If we're going to play together, I want no talking. We silently sit in a call

215
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:18,630
and I clear my throat every four to five seconds. Do you accept those terms? I just stare. All right.

216
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:25,460
Tasmanian Devil. I think I remember some of the stuff about Tas. Yeah. He's got the salt shakers.

217
01:04:43,159 --> 01:05:06,179
This guy is a horse. What's happening? Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

218
01:05:15,659 --> 01:05:33,110
Anyway, I got to eat them. No, I want to eat you. Not the other way around. Come on.

219
01:06:17,289 --> 01:06:27,539
Every time I go off the side of the cliff, I fucking panic, dude. I go off the side and I go

220
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:53,320
and I fucking die. That's part of the game, man. Okay. Hold on. So how do I add,

221
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,019
how do I add you? All right. Let me get, I'm going to add Hassan on Discord.

222
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:04,280
You have to 430. Isn't that like 12 minutes? All right. Let's go.

223
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:16,010
All right. Let's, let's get, let's make this happen. Dude, if I 1v1 Hassan. Oh man. I'll,

224
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:27,699
can you imagine? Show the, show the bugs bunny. Okay. Add friend. I didn't have you as a friend

225
01:07:27,699 --> 01:08:02,139
on Discord. Okay. I send you a friend request. Okay. What if, what if I've just like juggle,

226
01:08:02,139 --> 01:08:06,630
juggle, juggle, juggle, juggle, kick, kick, juggle, juggle. Juggle, juggle, kick, kick,

227
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:19,699
juggle, juggle, juggle. What if he beats my ass? He's going to, he's going to beat my ass.

228
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:31,829
I'm going to have to go full bugs on this one. He's currently in the tutorial. Oh,

229
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:54,250
we got this then. Oh, we got this then. It's calling me right now. Hello. What's up? Oh my

230
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:59,130
God. I'm a Germaniac and this is a very special moment for me. I'm just letting you know.

231
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:03,529
You want to do 1v1? I heard you're in this. Is that what you call, is that what you call

232
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:07,659
your fan base? Are they Germaniac? No, you got it wrong. You got it wrong. It's all right.

233
01:09:08,619 --> 01:09:13,659
What do you call your fan base? It's, it's the Germamites. It's the Germamites? Yeah. I,

234
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:19,500
I don't have a cool name like that. Mine are Hassanabi heads. Prepare yourself. I just like

235
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,020
joined a game. I, I, all right. Let me, let me, let me, let me style on somebody real quick.

236
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:29,100
Okay. I don't know how to play this game at all. So you are going to destroy me if we 1v1. Oh,

237
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:35,529
then okay. Well, I'll go easy. I'll play a character I don't play. We can do 2v2. Can we

238
01:09:35,529 --> 01:09:40,970
like pair up and like beat on other people and then you carry me? I mean, I'm, I'm not very good

239
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:45,289
at this game either. I'm just, you know, I, I've done, I've dabbled a little. I think you're being

240
01:09:45,289 --> 01:09:49,529
modest. No, we're going to get absolutely on if we do this together. Did you ask your parents

241
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:56,250
before turning on mature language? Uh, yeah. Okay. Good. I didn't. I'm being a bad boy right now.

242
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:00,939
All right. Are you, are you watching my stream right now? Watch, watch me, watch me dunk on this

243
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:05,420
Superman. Ready? Check this out. Okay. Let's do it. Hold on. Hold on. I'm pulling you up right now.

244
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:09,659
I'm pulling you up. This is a test though. This is like a trial to see how good you are.

245
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:29,960
Is that communist Superman? Is that Superman? Is he red? Oh, he is red.

246
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,119
Yeah. You distracted me. You distracted me. You distracted me.

247
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:20,420
I won't make that mistake again. Hey, what happened? Don't you dare. Oh, I should have

248
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:25,220
ended it right there. That was stupid. All right. Everybody quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet,

249
01:11:26,409 --> 01:12:04,100
quiet, quiet, quiet. You like that cancel play the game. I swear to God. Oh my fuck. It's all right.

250
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:12,420
It's all right. It's all right. Did I just turn the stream off? Hello. Can you hear me?

251
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:20,420
Your stream was on. Okay. So what, what happened there? You want to do a little

252
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:25,220
post game analysis there? What went wrong? All right. So what went wrong is I'm suffering

253
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:29,939
from a little bit of gamer fatigue. It's 125 degrees in my room and Superman is overpowered.

254
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:35,939
He's got like, he's got a bunch of powerful moves. And I, I tried to juggle, but it,

255
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:40,579
look at the thermometer above here. It's 140 degrees in here. That's what happened.

256
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:48,229
It's just too hot in here. Yeah. It seems like you're, you're making excuses. It seems like

257
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:52,789
you are failing on the front of the phrase. It's just the game is such a weak mindset. Jerma.

258
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:58,310
I had it. I had it in the bag. I really do. I swear. You are okay with what happened losing

259
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:03,189
imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you've lost twice. There's

260
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:07,750
always something to learn and always room for improvement. Dude, I get, I get angry at every

261
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:13,350
little thing in the world. If the toilet paper has no toilet paper on it, I, in a rage, I grab

262
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:19,850
the cardboard and just crush it. You have no idea what I was referencing just there. Do you?

263
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:24,489
Well, you said, you said getting angry twice is bad, right? No, I said the phrase is just the game

264
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:30,229
is such a weak. I was just reading a Ninja tweet. Oh, I don't know any of this shit. I don't know

265
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:36,390
anything about anybody. Okay. It's all good. It's all good. Okay. I thought you were, I thought you

266
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:39,989
were helping me through that. I thought you were playing with a controller or keyboard and mouse

267
01:13:39,989 --> 01:13:45,350
because why would you play with a keyboard about, I don't know. Some people are sweaty like that,

268
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:51,100
but the reason why I ask you is because like, I'm really bad and I've never, I'm, I need your

269
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:58,220
advice on this. You have an Xbox controller. Yeah. Okay. Xbox. I'm trying to do a forward air

270
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:03,100
special currently or wait, a down air special. Okay. I'm doing the tutorial and I lost doing

271
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:07,659
the tutorial at first. Let's use our strength. You lost in the tutorial. I died during the,

272
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:11,260
during the tutorial. I mean, it's a hard game. It's, it's a, it's like a fighting game. Have

273
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:18,310
you played a lot of smash? Okay. You're playing smash. I've never played smash. No, I've literally

274
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:21,829
never played really. So this, this is going to be hard to explain some things then. Yeah.

275
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:27,770
Yeah. That's what I mean. I'm like legit worried about this, but it'll be all right with you by

276
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:34,250
my side. I think, uh, I think I, I, I have all of the, the necessary tools. Okay. So how do I

277
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:39,449
add you as a friend here? Oh, I don't know. Hold on. That's a good question. Real quick.

278
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:43,210
I don't want to show your, uh, do you care about getting your name shown? Do you have like the

279
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:49,300
notifications turned off? Turn them off if you don't. Um, I don't know on what is it you

280
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:56,819
like the actual multi-versus client? No, I don't even know if I have it on right now.

281
01:14:57,779 --> 01:15:04,149
Is that how we're a multi-versus client is what it's WB games. Yeah. Just, just, just like, uh,

282
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:07,270
in your settings, just make sure you have your like invite notifications off. Cause when they

283
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:11,590
see it, they're going to go, you know, you're going to get pinged. All right, let's do it.

284
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:18,149
All right. So how do you manage? Oh, okay. Here we go. What is your invite from friends only? No,

285
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:23,029
I'm just going to have it open for now. So what's your, I'll tell you what my username is. I think

286
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:28,390
you can find me that way. Okay. Right. I don't even know where to find, uh, friends though.

287
01:15:28,949 --> 01:15:33,029
I can add you. It's so in the, in the top, right, there's like a tab menu. You open that up.

288
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,989
It shows you who you played with, who you're friends with, and, or your, your online steam

289
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:41,800
friends and all that stuff. Oh, we can do it through steam, right? I, we probably can just do

290
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:46,199
it through WB. Okay. Let's do it through WB then. What's your in-game name in, uh, in the

291
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:52,520
multi-versus? That's, I just wrote it in the discord chat. Oh, okay. I think that's what it

292
01:15:52,520 --> 01:16:01,000
is in my WB. Uh, that's what it is. I hope this is right. I think so. Let's see. That's you.

293
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:10,810
You have open invites. Yeah. Okay. I just invited you to a party. Did you get it? Hold on. I have

294
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:16,149
a weird name. It's like a two V two. I think we can, I think we're going to do two V two.

295
01:16:18,069 --> 01:16:22,390
Wait, we're just going right in. I mean, you invited me for a two V two, right? That's what

296
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:28,199
you invited me for. Oh, I just, I kind of, I just invited you to a party. It just said,

297
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:32,840
I mean, your name is about to show up. I'm just letting you know. Oh, it doesn't matter. It's

298
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:39,640
all right. Okay. You're, you're this, right? You're, you're Shaggy just like I am. Yeah. Yeah. I play,

299
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:43,800
I play Bugs Bunny. I'm a Bugs Bunny player. I've got a lot of experience playing Bugs or Taz.

300
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:49,800
Okay. My, my selection, my character selection process oftentimes revolves around who I think

301
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:56,060
is the coolest looking character. Who do you think? Um, Bugs Bunny. We're going to do dual

302
01:16:56,060 --> 01:17:01,180
bugs. We could, but we're going to, no, no, no, no, expert. Oh no. Iron giant is expert. No,

303
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:05,340
iron giant is actually putting iron giant. It's good. It's really, really heavy. Really, really

304
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:10,659
hard to knock off the stage. I would, I would recommend it. Dude, just press every, just press

305
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:16,380
every face button, like just mash buttons. You'll be all right. Wait, I have a ticket. Okay. I

306
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:20,300
unlocked them. Wait, you got in trouble. Why do you have like a ticket? Do you have a ticket

307
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:25,180
like in the game? No, like I unlocked them with a face ticket or something. That's what it's. Oh,

308
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:30,699
it's like, oh, I got a ticket. All right. Iron giant classic. No, let's go with the default.

309
01:17:30,699 --> 01:17:35,100
Look. Okay. We're, I'm ready to go. We're going to get, we're going to get annihilated.

310
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:42,229
All right. Do I say wait in lab? I don't know. Yeah. It's two v two. Are you ready? This is,

311
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:46,630
this is baptism by fire, man. You ready? Dude, I'm so ready. I don't even know what the,

312
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:51,960
what the buttons do, but I'm ready. All right. So what do you have for a controller?

313
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:58,329
I have a, uh, a PS five controller. Okay. So square is your kind of regular attack.

314
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:04,010
If you hold square and not move, you'll do a power charge and that's a big power charge move.

315
01:18:04,569 --> 01:18:11,880
If you hold up and X or square places, do you have, uh, do you have perks by the way? Yeah.

316
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,960
You got, you got to level a character up first. Oh, damn. You have, you leveled your character

317
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:22,279
up already level seven. Maybe play for like an hour, hour and a half. Damn. You're so good, dude.

318
01:18:23,689 --> 01:18:29,140
I'm telling you, you're going to like this game. Okay. So all you got to do is just get in front

319
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:33,300
of them and what this person has something here. What is this? They have all the per this one has

320
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:39,619
the Velma has all the perks. Prepare your shot painted target. Okay. The coconut mints coming

321
01:18:39,619 --> 01:18:45,220
out for this one has on. Okay. Just tell me what buttons to press and I'm going to press them.

322
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:50,739
You're, you're going to be pressing triangle in directions and a square and directions up and

323
01:18:50,739 --> 01:18:54,180
triangle is a recovery move. If you fall off the stage, why am I talking into the camera? Like

324
01:18:54,180 --> 01:19:09,109
you're here. Let's go. Oh my God. Oh my God. Just stay in the way. Really powerful. What is this?

325
01:19:09,109 --> 01:19:18,630
Yeah. He's really good. No, no, just don't fall off stage. Yep. You're good. I can fly. Oh,

326
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,520
you know, it's awesome. I get to be the big brother in this scenario. It's the first time

327
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:32,569
I've ever experienced something like this. No. Okay. He's 76. Good. Or is that bad? You don't

328
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:50,340
want your number to be higher. You want to stay low. Good job. Good job. So far. Oh,

329
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,859
a hundred and seven hundred and 10. Oh my God. Am I kicking ass or what? Yeah.

330
01:20:01,979 --> 01:20:08,619
Good. Oh my God. That was actually perfect. That was actually perfect. I swear to God. Oh,

331
01:20:08,619 --> 01:20:18,329
no, no, no, no, no. Don't push me. Don't push me. We're gonna lead. Oh, wait, I can pick them up.

332
01:20:18,329 --> 01:20:48,229
That's crazy. Let's go for the bully. They got armor too. So we can break through. It's crazy.

333
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:55,020
It's like it's getting me in the mood. Yeah. It has no business going this hard. Oh,

334
01:20:55,020 --> 01:21:03,460
shit. Oh crap. Watch this. Goodbye. Where am I finding the cars to crumple them up? I don't

335
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:08,420
know how you still on the stage, but oh, there we go. Let's go. Okay. Well, it's fine. I died

336
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:21,140
once, but they've died multiple times, right? Yeah, we're good. Oh, get absolutely destroyed.

337
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:29,819
Velma, where are your glasses? Velma. Oh, I need those glasses to see how high I can throw you

338
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:35,180
up. That's it. That's it. That's it. Is there a dance? Can I do it? Can I do a dance like,

339
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:43,659
uh, uh, uh? Am I a gamer? Am I a gamer chat? It's cool. I just wanted to impress you,

340
01:21:43,659 --> 01:21:47,340
Jerm. I was lying. I'm actually a professional gamer. I've played this game so many times.

341
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:52,460
Have you actually played this a lot? What? No, no, dude. Should we rematch? No, right? No,

342
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:58,340
why not? Let's do it again. I declined. We need someone better. Hey, they were good.

343
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:07,449
They knocked us off the stage. That was a good showing. That's the first time you've ever played.

344
01:22:07,449 --> 01:22:19,020
Fired up right now. You have no idea. You got drops on. Yes. All right. Same deal. So yeah,

345
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:23,739
I enjoy. Okay. Once you get to a certain, you fill this bar that he has underneath his health.

346
01:22:24,859 --> 01:22:30,060
If you hold triangle, you'll turn into kind of like a war machine and you have other moves.

347
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:38,460
Yeah. They're pretty, they're pretty good. Right. I, I'll be honest. I have no idea.

348
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:44,390
I think that's how it works. This is so sick. I'll go Taz.

349
01:22:48,409 --> 01:22:52,329
Imagine not believing. Yeah. I mean, I didn't, I thought we were going to get destroyed,

350
01:22:52,329 --> 01:22:57,560
but we did pretty good. You know, you didn't believe in me, but more importantly,

351
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:03,960
you didn't believe in yourself. No, I didn't. Am I going to get, are you going to get any more

352
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,600
gamer quotes to me that I'm going to misunderstand? No, it's fine. That was the last one. I'm never

353
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:15,289
doing that again. Do you have currency? You are, I forget that you are my age or in my,

354
01:23:15,289 --> 01:23:20,090
in my age group. And therefore these kinds of things are impressive to zoomers, but not to you,

355
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:28,170
not to a esteemed gentleman such as yourself. Are you 30 31 32? I'm about to be 31 on July 25th.

356
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:32,489
All right. Well, happy early birthday. Thank you. I'm going to go with iron giant again,

357
01:23:32,489 --> 01:23:38,789
because it says expert and I'm kind of an expert, I think. Right. He just gets in the way. He's just

358
01:23:38,789 --> 01:23:43,350
really in the way. Yeah. Oh, I don't have enough gold to unlock the variant. Okay. We'll just keep

359
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:52,710
Do you have any skins? Oh, how do we know? Oh, wait, hold on. I got a perk. Let us put it on

360
01:23:56,729 --> 01:24:05,369
Batman and Shaggy. Do you have any perks or just probably not? No, I have no perk. I do.

361
01:24:05,369 --> 01:24:09,369
This was literally the first match I've ever done. I didn't even finish the tutorial. Oh, wait,

362
01:24:09,369 --> 01:24:14,550
I do. Wait, do I have perks? I have a defensive perk, boundless energy. Now I have perks.

363
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:23,100
Well, you actually don't really need the tutorial. It's itself. Okay, here's just don't fall off the

364
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:31,350
stage. That's it. The higher your number is, the more you're going to travel when you get hit hard.

365
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:37,989
So if you're at 200 150, you're going to it's going to be easier to knock you off the stage.

366
01:24:37,989 --> 01:24:42,310
Just don't fall off the stage. That's the entire game. Okay, got it. That sounds really simple.

367
01:24:43,109 --> 01:24:48,310
I'm still going to mess it up. Probably. But I think the reason. Oh, no, this stage has a hole in it.

368
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:52,550
Oh, I'm so bad with holes. It's all right. They are. They probably will. They probably will be too.

369
01:24:54,949 --> 01:25:01,029
No, this guy's name is noob destroyer. Isn't it? I mean, we're new. He's going to destroy us.

370
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:06,149
Oh, even better if we beat him. Batman is beating me senselessly and mercilessly. I got it. I'm

371
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:17,239
coming. Let me let me take aggro. Let me take aggro from the Batman. Oh, God. Oh, Batman is

372
01:25:17,239 --> 01:25:33,060
noob destroying me pretty hard through Batman. Oh, yeah. Batman get absolutely destroyed.

373
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:54,600
Batman, what happened? Oh, no, it's all right. We're good. One time. No, no, I die. It's all

374
01:25:54,600 --> 01:26:02,020
right. We're good. We're good. We're good. While I was trying to push him, that was a silly.

375
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:08,390
That was a silly death that happened right there. Good juggle. Good juggle.

376
01:26:09,829 --> 01:26:29,430
We're good. Pull it back. What is a juggle? We're tied up. It's like when you juggle them,

377
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:34,069
like when you throw them off. Yep. This way, they bounce, bounce, bounce. My hands are hurting.

378
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:38,949
That's like how little gamer that's a little gamer muscles I have. It's all right. They're

379
01:26:38,949 --> 01:26:55,770
getting some work today. Oh, be careful. Wait, what am I doing? You said be careful. I'm talking

380
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:59,449
about me out loud. Oh, it's anybody's game right now. Whoever falls off next is over.

381
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:09,000
Oh, well, I'm close to falling off then. No, we got new destroyed. Okay, we have to defeat them.

382
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,119
We have to defeat them in the marketplace of ideas. That was that was so close. That was so

383
01:27:14,119 --> 01:27:21,239
close. Okay, my I'm weak. I'm weak on this map. This map has a lot of holes in it. Sorry. That's

384
01:27:21,239 --> 01:27:27,460
hard. They'll just take a look at this and go. They'll fucking go run. Wait. Oh, crap. I think

385
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:34,600
I declined on accident. Damn it. I pressed X because I saw X. That was so close to that was

386
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:41,399
actually insanely close. We were down three to not three to one, three to nothing. We pulled it

387
01:27:41,399 --> 01:27:49,000
back to three three. So don't worry. We just keep your channel. Thank you. Taz is good.

388
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:57,909
Let's get a learner play. Sorry, I failed you, Jerma. No, I got knocked off twice.

389
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:10,220
Go back to bugs. Should I buy this thing? That's half the fun. I'm gonna do that in a little bit.

390
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:16,539
Dude, I have this. Look at my damage control. No dumb mistakes. Oh, chat's doing gamma right now.

391
01:28:16,539 --> 01:28:20,140
Let's play some damage control. No dumb mistakes. Get some good hits in and you'll win for sure.

392
01:28:20,859 --> 01:28:28,619
Yeah, all we gotta do is keep recommending Shaggy. I didn't like Shaggy. He's too slow for me.

393
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:41,060
People say he's good. Arya Stark expert assassin. Hyper Game of Thrones. You know who is who was

394
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:45,619
good? Superman is actually really good at when I said that he's got like powerful moves pretty

395
01:28:45,859 --> 01:28:49,380
easy to play. You just kind of have to float around and do the freeze breath of people.

396
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:54,420
All right, I'm unlocking Superman. Let's do it. Let's go. Let's go. I want communist Superman,

397
01:28:54,420 --> 01:29:00,310
though, like the the red one. I'm sure it's available. Just use your unlockable ticket.

398
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,640
I did. I just did. I'm ready to go. I'm Superman. So you're so you're going to be communist Superman

399
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:13,000
and I'm going to be like rich bugs bunny. There's only one in the bathroom, man. I don't think I

400
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,819
can unlock communist man yet. I'm rich bugs bunny in the bathrobe when you're going to be

401
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:28,699
communist Superman. Yeah, it's yeah. Together we you know, it's the duality. You know what I mean?

402
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:40,220
I think we got it. All right. So you're Superman movement speed. I'm going to do defense stuff.

403
01:29:40,859 --> 01:29:47,300
I don't have any sense. Yeah. If you start playing with the same character, you'll unlock stuff.

404
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:52,890
So what we said you had something to be like at 430 or something. You had something going on.

405
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:58,970
Prepare yourself. What is it? I asked this guy's toes. We wanted to play with me

406
01:29:59,609 --> 01:30:04,010
because I found out that he was one of the people who was doing the hashtag ad,

407
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:07,850
which by the way, this is a hashtag ad. I think I need to say like the FTC thing.

408
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:16,739
But is it in your title? Yeah, it is. All right. This is an ad. Although, although the game is

409
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:28,020
fit. Oh, oh, get absolutely destroyed. Garnet. Oh, oh, oh, my God. I'm bouncing her off the wall.

410
01:30:29,539 --> 01:30:50,739
Good. Good. You found your character. You found his car. Oh, shit. Okay. Boom. Boom. Oh, no. Oh,

411
01:30:50,739 --> 01:30:55,140
bugs. When he's a mage character, right? That's why it's like got so many cool skills and stuff.

412
01:30:55,220 --> 01:31:08,699
He's fun. Oh, I tossed their ass. Oh, shit. Get out of here. Get out of here.

413
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:15,659
See ya. Oh, get out of here. Oh, yeah. They're both. They're both down. They're about to get

414
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:24,729
blown up. Watch your head. Garnet is down. Good stuff. Oh, yeah. How about an adventure?

415
01:31:25,449 --> 01:31:31,529
That was quite a line. What is she doing? Is she all thing? No, nobody has any old.

416
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:40,550
They bounce me off the platform, dude. I'm beating ass. I'm beating cheeks. I'm beating cheeks with

417
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:44,710
the Superman. Did you feel old when they asked you what how old you are in the beginning of the game

418
01:31:44,710 --> 01:31:50,470
and it only went up to 22? Yeah. What's up with that? Yeah, that was weird. Oh, no, no, no, no, no,

419
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:56,899
sorry. I'm going to come back harder and stronger for that one.

420
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:07,699
Oh, they got speed up. What the hell? Don't matter. We got it. We got advantage. That doesn't

421
01:32:07,699 --> 01:32:26,409
matter. I will give you a faster ticket out of here. Let's go. Wait, what does that do? What does

422
01:32:26,409 --> 01:32:37,180
the star do? I don't know. All right. Go for the stuff on on on fin. It's all right. We got

423
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:45,689
we got match point here. He's done. He's done. He's not going to make it. Oh, yeah, he did make it.

424
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:54,500
Oh, just one hit. He's gone. He's won it. There he goes. All right. Let's go.

425
01:32:56,979 --> 01:33:03,659
That was awesome. Dude. Oh, my God. Victory sounds so sweet. It feels so sweet. How fast can you

426
01:33:03,659 --> 01:33:13,029
clap? Incredible. We are the greatest team. Can I hear a fast clap? How fast can you clap?

427
01:33:13,029 --> 01:33:19,350
Wait, I want to do a rematch. I am down to defeat weak people in the marketplace of ideas now.

428
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:25,850
It's all right. I'll do it. Thank you, Warner Bros. for Warner Bros. Interactive for sponsoring

429
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:32,439
this. Yes. Thank you. Sponsored by Warner Bros. Interactive. That's what I was going to say. Yeah,

430
01:33:32,439 --> 01:33:44,500
that's what we need to do. I've done it a few times. Hey, open beta is July 26. Yeah,

431
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:49,380
PlayStation access the open beta as long as you get, you know, you click the link in your chat

432
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:54,340
and create your WB account and you get drops. Drops are enabled on the stream. All you need

433
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:59,300
to do is watch for an hour. Dude, I'm so good for someone who never does hashtag ads. I'm

434
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:05,510
I'm doing it. I'm doing the damn. That was it. That was pretty good. That was a good ad. Thank

435
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:11,670
you. It's because of you. You're giving me the power to do it adequately. I think we got to,

436
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:17,430
I think your Superman is your guy here. I think you got a good Superman. Yeah, it didn't even hurt

437
01:34:19,899 --> 01:34:23,659
my fingers playing Superman. Yeah. Do I have perks on that? You're talking about your hands were

438
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:29,100
hurting? When I was doing Iron Giant, I think it's because like, you know, it's a muscle. Like,

439
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:33,979
people always say, like, oh, gaming, like, it's not that, you know, it's not physically

440
01:34:33,979 --> 01:34:37,420
strenuous, but they don't understand, like, you have gamer hands. You know what I mean? Like

441
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:43,739
the inside of my hand hurts a little bit from flexing so hard. Yeah. My sometimes my the thumb,

442
01:34:43,739 --> 01:34:50,819
uh, like webs hurt, you know, you know what I mean by that? You have webbed thumbs like the web of

443
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:54,420
your thumb. Really good at swimming for that reason. Oh, this map, this map is good. This map is easy.

444
01:34:54,899 --> 01:35:11,300
Yeah, it's like, uh, just nice and flat. I like that. Dude, I am bouncing. Taz is actually,

445
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:36,170
I got to learn how to play Taz. He's awesome. Okay. Nice. This game is freaking flying, brother. Oh,

446
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:43,050
crap. Oh, he's a turkey. I turned her into chicken dinner. We got him. Dude, that's what an awesome

447
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:46,970
power by Superman. You turn people into turkeys. That's I can't believe it. Did I do that? No,

448
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:50,729
yeah. Yeah, you did. He's got, I think there's a power of probably. No, that's a, you don't

449
01:35:50,729 --> 01:35:56,220
remember the Superman cartoon. He would do his, uh, his heat ray and they would turn into dinner.

450
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:16,010
Oh, he's in trouble now. The people were playing bad or am I really good? Like,

451
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:19,529
I don't know what's going on. I think we just, we're just stringing it together. That's all.

452
01:36:20,329 --> 01:36:34,979
We're, we've got good team chemistry. Oh, it's game over. Dude, what is that? What is going on

453
01:36:34,979 --> 01:36:40,420
right now? Oh my God. You may, we're just playing well. We're playing well. Or you think we're just

454
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:46,340
beating on 11 year olds, which by the way, they deserve it. Okay. If you come at the king,

455
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:51,699
you best not miss. Okay. I don't care. These are equal opportunity hands that Superman has.

456
01:36:53,529 --> 01:36:57,289
I mean, what time is it? Isn't it? What's, what's today? Tuesday at four 30.

457
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:07,340
Oh, I got an unlockable. What was it? Toast gold earned. I never, you know, what's really,

458
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:11,180
I don't know. This might be because I'm old, but like, I never know what the, the gold I

459
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:17,100
earn. Like, I don't know what any of this stuff is doing currently. I think you can use it to do

460
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:23,819
triple jump. Let's go. Okay. Did I have, do you have the premium pass? I don't know. I might.

461
01:37:24,779 --> 01:37:30,539
It is that, is that what we got with like the unlock or no? I, maybe I think so. Cause I,

462
01:37:30,539 --> 01:37:34,380
I hit it. I hit the unlock button. If you go to your battle, I got hella gold. Wait, what am I?

463
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:41,100
Oh my God. I didn't do any of the, I didn't realize that like, I had a bunch of gold from

464
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:47,899
and I have 2000 property Gleemium. Oh, we got to finish the starter missions. So you have to beat

465
01:37:47,899 --> 01:37:53,500
the tutorial. I think. Oh my God. There's a taunt. I'm unlocking this taunt. Oh my God. That's crazy.

466
01:37:54,140 --> 01:38:01,800
I can do pushups with my one finger. Maybe I'll do Velma. Velma's fun. Oh, I do. Yeah. I do have

467
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:10,649
these character tickets. That's right. Velma's interesting. She's got some fun moves. I unlocked

468
01:38:10,649 --> 01:38:17,430
an announcer pack too. I don't know what that does, but like he kind of, the guy kind of looks like

469
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:36,859
you badges, max character badge that I've unlocked. Okay. I don't have any general, but edit perks.

470
01:38:36,859 --> 01:38:43,500
I have triple jump, dude. It's probably like 500 degrees in here. Do you not have AC? What's going

471
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:51,859
on? I do, but I don't know. I just, I think I generate so much heat. Okay. I don't, I have a

472
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:56,500
Trump Tower Superman. What? How did you get that? One in a million, one million. It's a variant. It's

473
01:38:56,500 --> 01:39:01,300
an epic variant. I think they gave it to me because I'm, I might be the best that they've ever seen.

474
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:05,380
That's what I'm getting a call from Warner Brothers Studios. They're saying like, I might be able to

475
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:13,369
make it pro. Really? Yeah. It's crazy. They're on the line right now. That's actually a really

476
01:39:13,369 --> 01:39:16,090
cool skin. People are going to think you're really good at the game. So you're going to have to step

477
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:25,130
it up here. You're going to have to step it up. You don't have a gold skin and be bad at the game.

478
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:35,350
Can we do 2v2 with other people? I don't know. Is that possible? Lyrick is playing too. We could

479
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:41,779
get like Toast and Lyrick and then do a 2v2. I mean, I would do it if people want to play. They

480
01:39:41,779 --> 01:39:50,069
would whoop our asses, I think. I mean, I don't know how sweaty they are. How? I mean, people

481
01:39:50,069 --> 01:39:53,670
really haven't had access to the game in a while. I think everyone's kind of on the same playing

482
01:39:53,670 --> 01:40:03,340
field. Here we go. Toast is a sweat. That's what they're saying in the chat. And Lyrick is a sweaty

483
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:08,779
gamer too. I think they would probably destroy us. This is the all-Boomer team. You, me, Lyrick,

484
01:40:08,779 --> 01:40:17,529
Toast. Everyone's a Boomer. But it's all old? I don't know how old Toast is. I mean, I am sweating.

485
01:40:18,329 --> 01:40:22,329
I wore a tank top specifically because I knew I was going to be heating up in here.

486
01:40:22,329 --> 01:40:34,180
Wear tank tops is your thought, okay? B, F, E, 4, R, the elite, feared goblin. What do they mean by

487
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:38,579
that? What are they, like a clan? I think they're queuing. Well, we're queuing together.

488
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:44,229
This almost was a mirror. Should it be a mirror? Oh, it's too late.

489
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:55,189
I forget pretty much all of Velma's moves, but I'm going to try. I got you. I got you, King. I got

490
01:40:55,189 --> 01:41:07,880
you. Let's do it. I hope we don't get destroyed by this clan. I love this song. What song is this

491
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:14,619
from? Let's do it. Wait, I thought you were golden. Why are you silver now? I am gold.

492
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:22,220
Just for you. What? I am gold. What do you mean? You're not gold. You're like 1930s Superman,

493
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:30,569
like black and white TV. No, I'm gold. On my screen, I'm gold. Oh, maybe it doesn't. I don't

494
01:41:30,569 --> 01:41:39,739
know. I'm confused. Oh, God. They're beating my ass off. Oh, God. Superman. Chill. Chill. Chill.

495
01:41:39,739 --> 01:42:04,149
No, no, I had triple jump. We're good. Wait, how do I pick up the power up?

496
01:42:06,630 --> 01:42:25,579
Left trigger. No, don't die. Don't die on me. Yes. Oh, nice. Oh, Superman. Come on. Come on,

497
01:42:25,579 --> 01:42:30,699
Gwen. Come on, Gwen. Oh, God. Oh, he's beating my ass. He's beating my ass in the QRTs.

498
01:42:31,659 --> 01:42:38,220
I don't know. What does this mean? Oh, it's down. No, wait, what the fuck? Wait, how?

499
01:42:39,619 --> 01:42:46,250
That's crazy that that happened. I don't know what I just did. Dude, what? Are we busted? Oh,

500
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:50,890
I think I killed him. No, we're okay. Wait, how is he not dead yet? We're good. We're in the lead.

501
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:18,739
Hey, they got gamer fatigue. We're good. Oh, God. Sorry. Match point. Match point. Let's get it.

502
01:43:18,739 --> 01:43:45,930
Oh, no. Enemy team advantage. Juggle. No. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Superman. Bully Superman. Get

503
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:51,930
Superman. Bully Superman. Get Superman. Bully Superman. Get Superman. Bully Superman. Bully

504
01:43:51,930 --> 01:44:12,060
Superman. No, this is tough. This is tough. These guys are good. Dude, we just got to hit him one

505
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:16,460
time. I got him. I got him. I got him. He's gone. He's gone. Oh, he's not gone. You got it. He's

506
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:26,119
gone now. Let's go. We did it. We're good. Let's go. Let's go. I choked. I choked. Oh, crap.

507
01:44:28,149 --> 01:44:34,199
Dude, I'm doing so many YouTube faces. I've never tasted the sweet nectar of victory before.

508
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:41,800
I get owned so regularly normally. I know. Doesn't it feel great? I've never been good at a video

509
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:45,399
game my whole life besides Elden Ring. And in real life, if somebody threw an axe at me, I would

510
01:44:45,399 --> 01:44:52,539
dodge it. Are you? Wow. Okay. I'm bad at video games, but if you if somebody swung an axe at

511
01:44:52,539 --> 01:45:00,310
me in real life, I would dodge it. Really? How are you so confident in that? Just trust me on that.

512
01:45:01,109 --> 01:45:04,310
Lyric is the Emmy. He said, yo, I'm down to group if you guys actually want to group. Not sure if

513
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:10,840
Chad is trolling. Can we actually physically do it? I don't know. Can we do a four cube?

514
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:24,420
Wait, I have a new move. Oh, shit. I don't. I don't know why I'm not unlocking any new perks,

515
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:28,020
honestly. I don't know what's going on. I think the game is basically saying like,

516
01:45:28,979 --> 01:45:33,300
we don't want to give you more perks because you're already so cracked. You know what I mean?

517
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:40,500
Yeah, I feel that I do. I think you just have to get to like level 10 20. No, I like I'm pretty

518
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:44,819
sure the game is like we noticed that like, you know, we don't want to hit you with a vac ban.

519
01:45:44,819 --> 01:45:48,979
Like we noticed that you're too good for the game. Like we suspect that you might be cheating.

520
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:56,260
No one is this good. All right. Pencil pencils down on paper. Let's go. Oh, I hate this. I hate

521
01:45:56,260 --> 01:46:04,420
this map. This map is complicated and confusing. I don't like it. It's good. You want to be you

522
01:46:04,420 --> 01:46:16,760
want to catch them when they're on the top layer. What the hell? Adventure time is turning into a

523
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:40,140
horse. Oh, no. Wait, what the hell? No, no, no, no, no. Pulled together. We're good.

524
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:56,680
Oh, that was a good hit. Superman kind of messes me up, though, because like I'm Superman. So when

525
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:01,159
I say I got him, I got his ass. When I'm Superman and I see another Superman, it freaks me out a

526
01:47:01,159 --> 01:47:07,000
little bit. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's weird seeing your own moves. Yeah. And he's got more

527
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,439
perks to me. He's a Superman with more perks to me. So that makes it worse. You know what I mean?

528
01:47:12,949 --> 01:47:27,239
Oh, God, no. Oh, my God. I'm beating his ass. We're good. We're good. Wait, what? Oh, chill.

529
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:35,340
Well, I just flying off the screen. That was insane. I'm cracked. I'm cracked. I'm cracked

530
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:39,819
with it. I'm nice with it. I'm nice with it. I'm so nice with it. Oh, nasty. Nice. Oh, I died.

531
01:47:39,819 --> 01:47:46,420
But it's OK. It's OK. We got more. I've got a better idea this time. I'm nasty. Nice with it.

532
01:47:47,140 --> 01:48:01,579
This dog. Nice job. Nice job. Nice job. Wait, why is that not working? Zap.

533
01:48:01,579 --> 01:48:12,840
Laser. Get laser, goblin. Get fucking laser, dude. No. Take a whack at it. Throw him down.

534
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:17,720
Nice. There it is. Nice. Game over. Oh, wait, it's not game over. One more. We got the advantage.

535
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:46,250
Get fucked. Get fucked. Oh, shit. No. Oh, shit. It's all right. We can attack the K. What does

536
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:51,449
that mean? Oh, don't do the same attack more than a few times in a row. You get a it decays the

537
01:48:51,449 --> 01:49:05,300
damage it does. That was actually pretty sick if that knocked him off. But awesome. No, no, no.

538
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:12,840
He's behind me. Oh, he blew me up. Shit. It's all right. We're OK. Fully Jake. Get him. Jiggle him.

539
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:21,750
Jiggle peak. Oh, yeah. Oh, shit. No, no, no, no. Oh, oh, my God. They're bouncing my ass.

540
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:34,819
That skateboard bullshit. Oh, that's it. It's game over. Nice. Nice job. Let's go.

541
01:49:38,409 --> 01:49:44,819
Oh, my God. Toast and Lyric are ready. OK, how do we add them? Do you think we're ready?

542
01:49:44,819 --> 01:49:49,939
Do you think we're ready for a 2v2? I think we could be ready for a 2v2, but we got to figure

543
01:49:49,939 --> 01:49:57,579
out how to do it. OK, let's see. What's the what's the process here? Just add to party.

544
01:49:57,659 --> 01:50:00,380
I just toasted them. They just toasted us. I don't know what that means, but.

545
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:11,210
Oh, that was you. You did pretty good damage. Your character. Whoa. Thank you. I have an invite.

546
01:50:11,210 --> 01:50:16,170
Should I do this from disguised toast? Is that actually disguised toast or is it an imposter?

547
01:50:18,539 --> 01:50:23,260
Wait, what is happening? Oh, I'm hitting control on my. Oh, God. Is this a fake?

548
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:29,930
Is this a fake or is this the right one? I don't know. Hold on. He said those made a game. Him

549
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:36,409
and I are in it. He's trying to add you guys. Oh, oh, wait, I found I found lyrics. Oh, I think

550
01:50:36,409 --> 01:50:41,529
is it I think this is correct. I don't even know how to add people. Let me see. Let me see. I think

551
01:50:41,529 --> 01:50:48,060
I can invite you. OK, I got to I got to confirm from disguised toast. I think that's him. All

552
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:54,069
right. I hope it's him. I hope it's him. Oh, yeah, this is this is it. This is true. This is

553
01:50:54,069 --> 01:50:59,100
this is them. So we got it. We got to be ready here. I don't have any friends.

554
01:50:59,909 --> 01:51:05,930
Once again, at the top of the hour, I'm going to run an ad or one minute outbreak here,

555
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:17,909
but also reminder that is an ad we are playing a video game that is our FTC requirement.

556
01:51:18,710 --> 01:51:27,750
Thank you to Warner Bros. Interactive for sponsoring this stream. Your character and also

557
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:33,270

558
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:37,850
progression. Everything that you unlock during this period will stick you with you with you all

559
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:43,770
the way through early access and open beta. Where you go? I did that joke a week ago. It's a good

560
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:55,289
joke. It's fine. All right. We joke. I was moving my lips. All right. Another player and I unlock

561

the reward. So we got we actually bring your game here because this is against other streamers.

562
01:52:00,569 --> 01:52:03,850
Bro, they're going to beat our ass. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm pretty sure. I mean,

563
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:10,329
they're both sweaty as hell. They're sweat lords. So they're level nine. Dude, Lyric is already

564
01:52:10,329 --> 01:52:15,609
level nine with his Batman, dude. That's fucking bullshit. I'll just say it. I'll go ahead and say

565
01:52:15,609 --> 01:52:29,500
it. That's not cool. It's all right. We got it. All right. I got I got perks. I have no perks.

566
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:34,329
You're level eight with the Bugs Bunny. Yeah, that the fear of me having a skin,

567
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:38,090
I think is going to put some fear into their hearts. Yeah, me too. They're going to be like,

568
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:43,369
whoa, that's gold. Gold Superman, like unheard of, you know, that that sort of thing, I think

569
01:52:44,569 --> 01:52:48,489
is what's going to happen. I'm very ready. Should we? Should we? Oh, shit, I should add them in a

570
01:52:48,489 --> 01:52:53,850
Discord call to why did I not do that? Hold on. But we didn't want to hear the strategies, though.

571
01:52:54,489 --> 01:53:05,779
No, no, it's fine. Let's go. I'm adding them. They're playing. Wait, are they playing? I'm not.

572
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:10,819
Why are we? Why are we? Why can nobody hit each other? What's going on? All right, we're good.

573
01:53:10,819 --> 01:53:15,140
I don't know. I just added them into the Discord call, which is a tactic I was doing,

574
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:20,020
but they didn't fall for it, Jerma. The classic Discord call before the game tactic. But

575
01:53:20,819 --> 01:53:23,619
I thought it was foolproof, but turns out it's not. You know what I mean?

576
01:53:25,859 --> 01:53:28,100
I'm going to I'm just going to be quiet and play because I want to win.

577
01:53:28,819 --> 01:53:37,180
I've got this. Why am I weakened? Why am I weakened? No, my bones are broken.

578
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,899
Batman broke my bones. Wait, what is he? He's always in a fucking.

579
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:47,220
Just stay out of that cloud. No, he's attacks are decayed. Wait. Oh, my God.

580
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:53,060
Oh, my God. Lyric is beating the doors off me, dude. I can't get him. He's a crack. He's a pro

581
01:53:53,060 --> 01:54:11,859
gamer. Just kidding. Get fucked. Oh, dude, you're destroying this guy's toes. Trade, trade. Oh,

582
01:54:11,859 --> 01:54:21,399
no, no. Sorry. Good. Good. Good. Wait, how am I healing? He's up. He's up. Yeah, let's go. Get

583
01:54:21,399 --> 01:54:56,569
one. Get fucked. Oh, the collapsing route. That's two this time. No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh,

584
01:54:56,569 --> 01:55:17,779
he body blocked me. Sure. You're not using. No, no. Oh, wait, how does he weaken me?

585
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:34,619
To be to hold together. I fucked up. I fucked up bad. No, I got stuck. You got it. It's fine.

586
01:55:34,619 --> 01:55:40,060
Don't worry about it. We got this. Don't feel discouraged. You got this, King. No, no. Oh,

587
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:55,210
my God. I almost fall. Nice. Wait, what? Wait, what happened? How did I? I don't know what

588
01:55:55,210 --> 01:56:01,930
happened. OK, well, they didn't add it. They didn't get on the call to my home. Did I stay

589
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:07,449
too high or something? I think, yeah, I think you were too much. I did the same thing, man.

590
01:56:07,449 --> 01:56:12,409
OK, wait, tell them to chat. Tell them to turn on the discord or pick up the call. I called them.

591
01:56:15,779 --> 01:56:23,159
We both got caught in the same exact spot. I think I think we got in the exact same spot.

592
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:31,579
Yo, yo, what's up, guys? What? I worked you. Oh, my God. After this, you can't even you can't

593
01:56:31,579 --> 01:56:36,869
claim to be a gamer if you get worked by us. I don't know. I saw a victory screen on my.

594
01:56:36,869 --> 01:56:41,350
I know. I just I mean, you got carried by Lyric. It's fine. It's not a big deal. Yo, what up?

595
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:46,149
What's going on? OK, this time it's for real. We were just like going easy on you guys. We're

596
01:56:46,869 --> 01:56:50,869
professionals. You know what I mean? Oh, no, I feel you. OK, I was. Yeah, my control wasn't

597
01:56:50,869 --> 01:56:56,390
plugged in. I got oil all over my hands. You did beat the doors off me, so I don't know how

598
01:56:56,390 --> 01:57:03,430
that works, Lyric, but OK. Did I swear bug? I swear you like act me up and I just like tagged

599
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:10,630
you. I went flying up. You set me on an elevator. I don't know how you you guys have like hella

600
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:17,510
perks and stuff, right? I mean, I mean, I can take them off. I mean, they're like, OK, no, no, no,

601
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:20,710
keep them on. I think it's all right. It's good that you have the you need all the advantage.

602
01:57:21,670 --> 01:57:25,989
You have a level three. Isn't that a level three perk? It's an X three. I don't know what you're

603
01:57:25,989 --> 01:57:31,109
talking about. I keep perspiring out of my hands. I don't have any perks. It's just fine. OK,

604
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:35,670
you guys know everybody, right? Germa, everybody knows everybody. I think so. I know of Germa,

605
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:39,510
but first time playing same with you toast. No of you, but you know, don't be afraid.

606
01:57:40,789 --> 01:57:45,430
Let's go for it. All right, let's see. Oh, I love this music. This is my favorite music.

607
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:58,279
This is like a Hercules one or something. It's the Steven Universe song. Oh, OK. Oh, yeah. Get

608
01:57:58,279 --> 01:58:05,079
fucking destroyed. That's so much damage. I know. I love I love juggling with Batman. How do you

609
01:58:05,079 --> 01:58:09,960
weaken? Do you know how that happens? I think just some attacks, depending on the character,

610
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:15,720
has weakened. My ex does weaken it every time I hit. What is the smoke cloud? Is that what is

611
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:21,239
that? If not cheating. I don't know what it does to you guys. I just you get. How do you

612
01:58:21,239 --> 01:58:26,039
how do you how do you enable like that? I just need to have, you know, you know,

613
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:35,020
you're hacking, which is fine, I guess. But oh, shit. It's unlock it with the key they gave you.

614
01:58:35,819 --> 01:58:40,939
Oh, the cheats. Yeah, I guess I missed it. Oh, wait. Oh, yeah. No, I didn't want to do it because I

615
01:58:40,939 --> 01:58:46,859
didn't want to just try it so hard, says the guy with laser eyes. Yeah, well,

616
01:58:47,899 --> 01:58:51,899
you're back. You're the only one in the game. Protect me. Protect me. I need a contraption

617
01:58:51,899 --> 01:58:58,380
to fly. This is like a backyard turf. I think Wonder Woman can fly, too, no? Oh, can she?

618
01:58:59,739 --> 01:59:06,140
I can show not in the game. So this is from Steven Universe. Yeah, the song is from Steven

619
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:10,220
Universe. I was thinking, like, where is the song from? And I just remembered it is from Steven

620
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:19,020
Universe. Oh, my God. I got that. Dude, this is so good when you juggle. It's like it's crazy. I

621
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:23,819
mean, when you when you get a string of combos, it's so stupid. Oh, like that. That was silly.

622
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:28,539
That's cheating, too. You have contraptions. That's literally cheating. Oh, it's a remix.

623
01:59:28,539 --> 01:59:37,979
That's cool. It's a good dodge. That was a good dodge. No, get out of here. Oh, my God.

624
01:59:40,699 --> 01:59:48,569
Where is she? Why are you blinking? I'm so mad. I'm so mad at you. I'm so mad at you. I'm so mad.

625
01:59:49,369 --> 01:59:53,779
Oh, shit. Yeah. Where's your kryptonite now, dude? Huh? Where's your kryptonite?

626
01:59:56,979 --> 02:00:05,210
Oh, God. Oh, I'm in trouble. Oh, shit. Watch your head. All right. You guys got to get out of here.

627
02:00:05,210 --> 02:00:12,010
All right. Oh, no. Germa, avenge me. You're good. You're good. I don't know why I'm talking like

628
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:18,489
Batman. But hey, you know what a tactic means, right? It means you're using your spam. You're

629
02:00:19,130 --> 02:00:25,050
a one hit Andy. Although you're talking to me, you're just screwing with my brain.

630
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:30,250
I thought you called me a one hit Andy. I was like, wait, why are you saying that you're my team?

631
02:00:31,289 --> 02:00:38,699
Wait, I thought that was them. That was friendly fire. That was friendly fire.

632
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:45,579
I'm just glad there's no shaggy mains in this lobby. He's okay. Is he? Is he actually low?

633
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:55,659
I fell. I'm trying to do a cool thing and I didn't do a cool thing and instead I did an uncool thing.

634
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:09,369
Yeah, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me. Watch me. Watch me resist it. Oh, shit.

635
02:01:10,489 --> 02:01:34,279
Huckum, you got Mr. BC. Get the fuck out of here. Oh, God. What? How is that even possible?

636
02:01:35,399 --> 02:01:48,579
How is that even possible? Oh, God. Toast. Get his ass. Get his ass. Get his ass. Oh, God.

637
02:01:49,140 --> 02:02:05,260
Oh, come on. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't, I can't catch you. Oh, hit it. Oh, what? How did

638
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:14,420
you dodge that? Oh, my goodness. Got to be fast. Swan diving. Oh, my God. We can't do this. I don't

639
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:27,289
understand. Yeah. Get over here. Oh, shit. Dude, that was a launch. Oh, that's safe. All right.

640
02:02:27,449 --> 02:02:32,329
We got Batman, Batman, Batman, Batman. Don't worry. We got this. We got this. I'm chilling.

641
02:02:32,329 --> 02:02:43,770
I'm chilling. No, no, no, no. Shoot. That's bullshit. That was cheating, but it's fine.

642
02:02:46,090 --> 02:02:49,770
It's all right. Good game. Dude, this game was actually a lot of fun.

643
02:02:50,729 --> 02:02:56,810
We were chasing you around, Toast. You were slippery. Yeah. I wonder why we lost. And then

644
02:02:56,810 --> 02:03:03,050
I look at how much damage I did, and it's 200. Hey, but you got the KOs. That's all that matters.

645
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:08,500
Just wait till the sweaty, really good players, they know how to use their supports

646
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:14,260
and just work together insanely. Oh, my God. It's going to be completely different.

647
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:17,939
Most of these characters just have those combo moves. It's going to be crazy.

648
02:03:19,369 --> 02:03:24,250
People are not going to fall off the stage. I bet the dog is low-key one of the best supports

649
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:32,489
or something. Whoever that weird dog with the stars. With the pole, right? Yeah. The tutorial

650
02:03:32,489 --> 02:03:37,369
dog. If you utilize that. The character has a team move. Choose your character. That helps

651
02:03:37,369 --> 02:03:46,090
the partner. The dog has two of them. Should we switch up teams? I'm good this way. I'm good

652
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:49,369
this way. I don't mind. We're going to get a dub. We're going to get a dub. We're going to get a

653
02:03:49,369 --> 02:03:56,010
dub. Wait, wait. You're not competent. You're not like you think. I'm so confident, dude.

654
02:03:56,010 --> 02:04:02,489
Listen, you need to get lucky every game. He didn't even finish the tutorial. Oh, yeah. Oh,

655
02:04:02,489 --> 02:04:07,609
no. No, I've been, but I've been, but we've been clapping cheeks nonstop. We actually have. This

656
02:04:07,609 --> 02:04:15,210
is the tutorial. Yeah. Trial by fire. Trial by combat. No, I respect that. I do the same

657
02:04:15,210 --> 02:04:19,609
shit. So you just got to throw yourself in and then figure it out when it's like,

658
02:04:20,569 --> 02:04:27,130
you got to be in the midst. Have you guys tried the new, uh, iron giant character yet? Dude. Oh,

659
02:04:27,130 --> 02:04:31,210
no, he got iron giant. He knows, he knows our strategies. He knows our strategies. He's good.

660
02:04:31,210 --> 02:04:36,170
He's really good. I versed him. He's sick. He's massive. This guy was with stream sniping earlier.

661
02:04:36,170 --> 02:04:43,130
I think what an iron giant was. No, I was using stream sniping in a game. We're all on the same

662
02:04:43,130 --> 02:04:50,329
stage. No, I'm saying like he was stream sniping our earlier fights. How I was slapping people

663
02:04:50,329 --> 02:04:56,890
with the iron giant. I should do that. Wait, can you do two of like, can you do Batman, Batman

664
02:04:56,890 --> 02:05:01,050
or only one person per team? I think you can do whatever. Yeah. Do us whatever. I think you can

665
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:15,380
do as many as you want. You can have two V two all iron giants. Oh shit. God, he's so big. Oh my God.

666
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:21,460
Oh, iron giant literally like does not get hit. I mean, he doesn't, he doesn't take damage.

667
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:29,750
He's really good. Oh my God. Toast already incredibly tanky. Oh, what's the fuck,

668
02:05:30,470 --> 02:05:36,470
dude? How do I keep getting weakened, dude? It's my hits. My hits. The first time I've ever like

669
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:42,069
gotten weakened, like you're, is it the cheats? Is that what it is? She's unlocked. It's the cheats

670
02:05:42,149 --> 02:05:47,270
plus. I think Batman's just every move weekends. I think that's just like his thing. Yeah. Okay.

671
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:50,630
That's cheating. That's I got it. No, that's what I was wondering. You just like the sheets

672
02:05:50,630 --> 02:05:57,270
unlocked. It's really heavy. Oh, come on. Like after this, I'll give you the file to extract

673
02:05:57,270 --> 02:06:01,029
anywhere but your steam director. What is he doing? He's got bolts and shit. What is that?

674
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:13,850
Dude, they are beating the shit out of us. Oh my God. No, that's a double kill.

675
02:06:13,850 --> 02:06:20,090
These are the platform. We did not just get double killed off the platform. Oh, we, oh, we did.

676
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:29,130
I'm so hurt. I'm so hurt. I'm going to hide behind the dude. He's huge. Oh shit. Wait,

677
02:06:29,130 --> 02:06:34,970
what the fuck? Oh, be careful. Oh my God. We can't get four out. We can't get four out. It's on.

678
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:42,680
Yeah, this is all you toast. You're like a raid boss. All right, we got it. Never mind.

679
02:06:43,640 --> 02:06:49,399
It doesn't matter. He's so powerful. That's why. That's why I said the iron meta. The iron giant

680
02:06:49,399 --> 02:06:55,960
meta is crazy. Everybody knows this. Please don't season me. All right. I'm not food.

681
02:06:56,920 --> 02:07:01,399
You turn into a turkey if I get enough on you. Only, only. Yeah. Only sweaty, sweaty boys.

682
02:07:01,399 --> 02:07:09,369
You're the iron giant meta. Oh God. I was just going easy. Oh yeah. What the fuck? Wait, how?

683
02:07:09,770 --> 02:07:15,050
Holy shit. I'm literally fucking body blocking you and you're just going up. You're tanking the hit.

684
02:07:18,739 --> 02:07:31,699
Yeah. All you toast. I'll give you a smoke bomber. All right. All you. No, no. Get fucking fuck.

685
02:07:31,699 --> 02:07:41,029
Get him. I'll move you over here. No. Wait, why can't I hit you? Hey, we can pull this back.

686
02:07:42,069 --> 02:07:45,350
Do you have like a double health bar or something? What is that? Yeah, I can.

687
02:07:52,010 --> 02:07:59,659
Oh, you're so heavy. Let's go get fucked. Oh, they're down here. They're down here. They're

688
02:07:59,659 --> 02:08:07,909
down here. No, just punish, punish, punish, punish down. Downward moves, downward moves.

689
02:08:09,529 --> 02:08:17,899
We're so screwed here. Dude, he's fucking, he's bouncing me. Oh God, he's bouncing me.

690
02:08:18,619 --> 02:08:28,619
Ping pong ball. Oh, that's it. I had 180. That was close. Were you covered? Really well. And

691
02:08:28,619 --> 02:08:33,020
that's what matters. It's almost like winning. Dude, this guy, he probably has like 500 damage.

692
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:43,819
All right. His hit box is so big. All right. Everybody go iron giant. We're going to do full

693
02:08:43,819 --> 02:08:58,260
iron giant. Okay. 379 damage. That's insane. You guys got drops on? Yes, sir. Excellent. I

694
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:02,579
got to unlock it, man. I got to use the current. Yeah. Yeah. You got to use the coupon or whatever.

695
02:09:02,579 --> 02:09:08,390
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. The coupons are actually good. All right. All right. Oh, I don't have enough

696
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:13,430
polimium. No, no. Use the ticket. You have 30 tickets, right? No, no, no. I already have that.

697
02:09:13,430 --> 02:09:17,909
I'm looking at the different variants, but I want to, I wanted to unlock the, uh,

698
02:09:19,979 --> 02:09:22,859
Oh, the one, the last one's nice with the, with the shades.

699
02:09:23,979 --> 02:09:27,899
How much is it? Wait, you have a different, oh, the beach giant, right? That's the one. Yeah.

700
02:09:27,899 --> 02:09:33,340
The last guy. What did I spend all my points on? Donnie Avon team up. No, no, I can't, I can't

701
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:41,180
betray, uh, German for the clean boys. I don't have enough currency. The clean boy loyalty is

702
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:47,340
strong, man. Are you guys both, are you guys both beach bums? Oh, okay. Oh, no, I didn't unlock.

703
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:54,380
I'm saving a little of my currency. Can't take you to the grave, brother. Waste the way, spend away.

704
02:09:55,100 --> 02:10:03,020
True, true. This is going to be actually pretty interesting. A bunch of nuts and bolts everywhere.

705
02:10:09,159 --> 02:10:12,199
Out of all of us, toast knows exactly what he's doing. We don't, we're just going to be

706
02:10:12,199 --> 02:10:16,119
pressing buttons. You got to guide the way. I mean, are you guys on keyboard or controller?

707
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:21,319
Controller. Are you playing keyboard? I'm playing keyboard. No, you're not.

708
02:10:22,119 --> 02:10:25,880
Holy bro. What do you really do? Like toast literally is like unlocking shit that I didn't

709
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:31,079
even know existed. Like, I don't know how he's got like bolts on and shit. I'm already dead.

710
02:10:32,119 --> 02:10:38,329
Who cares about the attack delay? Just do down, uh, down special. Oh, oh, okay. Oh,

711
02:10:38,329 --> 02:10:50,359
this is actually kind of cool. Oh, that's so stupid. Get fucking destroyed. Oh my God.

712
02:10:55,880 --> 02:11:01,779
I got confused. I thought I was toast. Yeah, no, that is a problem. That is definitely a problem.

713
02:11:02,899 --> 02:11:11,699
Oh, you guys are both, are you guys both red? Yeah, that's very confusing. How'd you do the

714
02:11:11,699 --> 02:11:14,260
missiles where I turned into like a terminator? What was that?

715
02:11:15,619 --> 02:11:26,659
Wait, what am I doing? I don't know how I did that. What does that do? I can bolt you.

716
02:11:27,859 --> 02:11:38,279
No, it's just the Rockham Sockham robots. What does this do? Oh, I couldn't even try it.

717
02:11:39,079 --> 02:11:48,729
I swear you're like locked into one mode. Is this our move? Oh, come on. Oh my God.

718
02:11:48,729 --> 02:11:55,689
Over the boot. You destroyed me, dude. Whoa. How are you going to blow up? What's happening?

719
02:11:57,430 --> 02:12:00,390
I don't know. I just, they were in a green, uh, sphere. I don't know what that was.

720
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:12,010
How have I not fallen off yet? I think it's like his ammo. He can shoot out.

721
02:12:12,569 --> 02:12:27,109
It's like, Oh, God damn it, dude. Oh, this is so dumb. Oh, come on. Come on. Are you fucking

722
02:12:27,109 --> 02:12:35,189
kidding me? Oh my God. That's slam, bro. What was that scream? That was like somebody was pulling

723
02:12:35,189 --> 02:12:40,069
teeth out of your mouth. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm

724
02:12:40,069 --> 02:12:45,350
feeding. I'm feeding. I don't like it. I'm sorry. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're okay.

725
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:51,460
We're okay. Bro. Toast is like literally fucking doing like, it's like playing it. Oh, come on.

726
02:12:52,659 --> 02:12:56,939
It's like an entirely different game that Toast is playing than us. I think he's like,

727
02:12:57,500 --> 02:13:00,779
I got like three fucking hits, three moves. Like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

728
02:13:01,899 --> 02:13:09,350
Protect friends. Oh God. He's glitch guarding me. Yeah. I'm going to suck him up. I'm going to suck

729
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:25,260
him up. All right. Attack. Why are we all in slow motion? You deal with him while I deal with Toast.

730
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:34,979
I deal with Toast. You deal with him. I'm going off the stage very quickly. What the fuck, dude?

731
02:13:34,979 --> 02:13:44,279
That thing is what? Dude, that was an endless spam. I'm dead. No, no, no. You're good. You're

732
02:13:44,279 --> 02:13:48,039
good. You're good. You're good. You're good. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm so dead. I died.

733
02:13:52,119 --> 02:13:56,920
That is an unreasonable amount of stun lock. You definitely did like 700 damage.

734
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:03,239
You guys are just defected models. How much damage? Yeah. 556 damage. Are you kidding me?

735
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:10,170
All right. 1v3. All right. Toast, you're on your own team. No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait,

736
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:16,810
can you even do 1v3s? No, I don't think so. Oh, let's see. We can do a free for all. Wait,

737
02:14:16,810 --> 02:14:23,899
who left? Oh, that sounds fun. Wait, someone left. Auto party request cancel or something.

738
02:14:23,899 --> 02:14:29,369
See, it says there. Yeah. Dude, you know what? I'm going to try. Everybody's in right now. Whatever

739
02:14:29,369 --> 02:14:32,810
you want to do. I'm going to try Shaggy, dude. I think Shaggy is the only one who can stop.

740
02:14:35,609 --> 02:14:41,130
You're trying to the dark side, man. Choose your character. I don't even know what Shaggy does, but

741
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:48,300
he's fast. He's like he's a brawler. So he's all about just like pure damage. I don't think he has

742
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:54,939
like a sandwich he throws. Everything else is like melee kicks, like all fighting brawler. Are you

743
02:14:54,939 --> 02:15:01,659
still in Japan? Like, where are you right now, Toast? Yeah, I'm in Kyoto right now. Oh, damn.

744
02:15:02,699 --> 02:15:09,739
Yeah, I'm screaming. What time is it over there? 9 a.m. So I started at 6 a.m.

745
02:15:10,699 --> 02:15:16,699
Damn, yo, gamer. Dude, it is 6 a.m. Oh, wow. I wanted to potentially go to Korea,

746
02:15:16,699 --> 02:15:19,420
but like I feel like the time zone difference is so severe.

747
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:29,479
Do you try and keep your schedule all the time? I try to do it in England. Wait, wait. Oh, you guys

748
02:15:29,479 --> 02:15:34,520
are trying different characters. Okay, this is the time to do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All level ones.

749
02:15:35,239 --> 02:15:40,420
Man, nobody knows what's going on. Japan Ping is still winning. Yeah, no, Japan Ping is helping

750
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:45,859
him, actually. That's why he's still cracked. Yeah, is this hosting up a toast or is this

751
02:15:45,859 --> 02:15:52,699
dedicated server? It doesn't feel laggy. I picked any server. Oh, you can choose? Okay.

752
02:15:53,579 --> 02:15:59,500
So you're at the disadvantage or at the advantage. This game plays so well online. It really does.

753
02:16:00,619 --> 02:16:05,020
Yeah, it's just that Japan Ping is helping him become unhittable. You know what I mean?

754
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:10,939
Oh, wait, we're doing like all free for all. Oh, okay. Any other video game? If you were

755
02:16:10,939 --> 02:16:14,539
playing from Japan and we are in North America, we would be literally teleporting ground screen.

756
02:16:15,659 --> 02:16:21,020
This is like actually crazy that we can play like this. Oh, come on, bro. German, German. Come on.

757
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:28,220
Don't hit me. Everybody hit, hit everybody. Hit this guy's toes. He's hiding. He's hiding in Japan.

758
02:16:28,699 --> 02:16:38,440
Garnet. I'll beat you with a sandwich. Oh,

759
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:52,500
what are we doing here, mate? Like a little bit of RP. Oh, Chuck Scooby. Oh, no, I just fell off

760
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:58,500
the map. Hassan, do your best Tasmanian Devil. I don't know what the Tasmanian Devil sounds like.

761
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:06,010
What? Oh, I got that one. That was a dump for me.

762
02:17:06,649 --> 02:17:22,100
Oh, wait, no, it wasn't. It wasn't. Oh, God. That actually wasn't bad. Yeah, it really wasn't.

763
02:17:22,739 --> 02:17:53,799
What is this? Oh, Shaggy. Oh, Shaggy's fucking broken. I told you, man. No. Oh, shit. I lost

764
02:17:53,799 --> 02:18:12,469
me. No. Oh, come on. Oh, no, Chuck Scooby. Why'd you do that to me? What was that? That was

765
02:18:12,469 --> 02:18:16,069
that was a weird graphic. Harley Quinn's graphic just kind of jumped up. Was that you?

766
02:18:17,510 --> 02:18:21,829
Harley Quinn? Yeah, I just saw there was like a Harley Quinn death screen. That was kind of cool.

767
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:30,969
Oh, shit. Oh, that was a huge health pack. I know.

768
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:43,750
Yeah. Time. What happened? Oh, Chuck Scooby. What happened?

769
02:18:45,030 --> 02:18:52,950
Is the real villain was me all along. All right. All right. It's not Shaggy.

770
02:18:56,629 --> 02:19:03,909
Let's go. Let's fucking go. Oh, here you go. Here's a dose for you. People are saying that's

771
02:19:03,909 --> 02:19:13,319
Morty. No, Morty would be more like. Oh, that's Rick. That's Rick. Yeah. My favorite anime.

772
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:22,379
I can't believe we have fucking pro gamers in this lobby and the worst loser one. What the fuck?

773
02:19:22,379 --> 02:19:27,500
Okay. Shaggy's. Hey, free for all. Literally free for all is just like the sneeze game mode.

774
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:32,620
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Okay. Okay. I didn't realize it was like that. My bad. Okay.

775
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:42,680
I just want people to like me. Are we doing free for all again?

776
02:19:43,399 --> 02:19:49,209
To be sure. Oh, to be to our to be to whatever. I think that's what. Yeah, let's go for it.

777
02:19:50,010 --> 02:19:57,129
To be to mods. If you want to adjust your Gamba accordingly. Right. We got to win one of these

778
02:19:57,129 --> 02:20:01,530
Hassan. We're getting kind of dunked on by. Yeah, no, I know. It's fucked up. It's because,

779
02:20:01,530 --> 02:20:07,690
you know, Japanese ping and also cheating. So it's fine. I think. Okay. Says the guy whipping

780
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:16,969
out Shaggy. Oh, all right. Shaggy. Got a mirror. Not perks though. Don't worry.

781
02:20:17,610 --> 02:20:22,729
Did none of us do. We're all level one. Oh, wait. Your Taz has the perk. Okay.

782
02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:30,250
Turbo's rocking it. It's 5% increased damage. That's basically 20. Shaggy superpowers up the Zaza

783
02:20:30,250 --> 02:20:37,420
is what people are saying. He's just super saying the Tasmanian devil is the most misunderstood

784
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:43,260
villain. He's not a villain. It's just like Looney Tunes are just weirdos. They're not bad.

785
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:48,459
Are they bad guys? Taz just wants to eat. He's just like a weird. He's a weird guy.

786
02:20:48,459 --> 02:21:05,159
All right. Oh, Scooby. I'm off the Zaza. Oh, shit.

787
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:36,260
Come on season season. Oh, wait, what the fuck? Oh, shit. Hey, yo, one's almost a turkey.

788
02:21:37,219 --> 02:21:49,860
No, don't turkey me. Oh, what just happened? That was bad. Wait, what the fuck? No.

789
02:21:52,579 --> 02:21:56,579
What happened? That's such a dumb way to die. I hate that's the worst thing I hate about these

790
02:21:56,579 --> 02:22:03,860
sorts of games is like you just like accidentally fucking get locked. Oh, I get stuck on the ledge

791
02:22:03,860 --> 02:22:29,379
or whatever. Yeah, there we go. There we go. There we go. That kick. Bro, he's got the knee,

792
02:22:29,379 --> 02:22:44,709

793
02:22:44,709 --> 02:22:52,739
Tasmanian devil. Yeah, dude. Taz is crazy, dude. I'm feeling okay. Okay, we got this next round.

794
02:22:52,739 --> 02:22:58,899
It's a wrap. It's a pepperoni pepperoni round. Thanks for the carry. You did double my damage.

795
02:22:58,899 --> 02:23:06,940
I got annihilated. That was teamwork, man. Oh, we got. Okay. I'm going back to the main

796
02:23:10,229 --> 02:23:18,950
main character. Oh, you're going main. Okay. Okay. All right. By the way, at the half hour

797
02:23:18,950 --> 02:23:25,510
mark, once every 30 minutes, we have to remind everyone that thank you Warner Bros for interact

798
02:23:25,510 --> 02:23:31,590
Warner Bros interactive for sponsoring this stream. Wow. Thank you for doing that for us.

02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:41,209
Yeah, no problem. An FTC disclaimer, July 26, the open beta PlayStation, Xbox and PC full

801
02:23:46,489 --> 02:23:52,329
out here. We got it. I finished my portion, but all good drops are enabled by the way. How long

802
02:23:52,329 --> 02:23:57,739
have we been playing this game for? I feel like I'm playing like four hours. This game's fun.

803
02:23:57,739 --> 02:24:02,540
It flies by, man. It's like, you know, yeah, no, this is, this is like one of the most breezy

804
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:09,209
hashtag ads I've done. Actually, it taps into your childhood. Like, come on now. I can't wait for

805
02:24:09,209 --> 02:24:16,090
some of the new characters. Prepare yourself. Warner Brothers has so much. Oh, they can pull.

806
02:24:16,090 --> 02:24:21,129
Oh my God. There's so many. They say who they're going to do or anything. Or I think they just

807
02:24:21,129 --> 02:24:27,129
kind of leaving it up in the air. But I'm very excited. They have so many cool characters.

808
02:24:27,129 --> 02:24:30,250
Are you guys going to play again on the 26th? I'm going to play again on the 26th, I think,

809
02:24:30,250 --> 02:24:33,530
or 26th or whenever it is. Yeah, we should group up again or something.

810
02:24:35,049 --> 02:24:39,180
Oh yeah, they should add Gandalf. Yeah, lyrics like lyrics like, yeah, let's group up again

811
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:44,700
so I can beat your asses with ease. This is a lot of this is like me and German,

812
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:49,340
like beating the crap out of 11 year olds earlier. Hey, come on. They were 12.

813
02:24:52,219 --> 02:24:55,180
Did you guys get did you guys get weirded out by the age thing too? It's like,

814
02:24:55,979 --> 02:25:02,620
are you below 10 or like, are you below 10 or 20 plus? It's like, well, OK, I'm 22 plus.

815
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:14,819
Yeah, that was definitely like a weird range. Hey, hey, hey, what the fuck? What happened?

816
02:25:17,219 --> 02:25:24,340
I saw you like lose track or something. My controller just unplugged. Oh, never mind.

817
02:25:24,579 --> 02:25:31,139
Oh, no, German. No, no, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine that your controller's unplugged.

818
02:25:31,139 --> 02:25:35,819
We still got this. My guy just ran off the screen. It's the last action I did.

819
02:25:38,889 --> 02:26:04,250
Oh, my goodness. Wait, what? It's tied up. Wait, what? I can't tell if that's your fog

820
02:26:04,250 --> 02:26:10,090
or if this is the game fog. No, this is the level fog level fog. Mine's like more white.

821
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:20,040
What? You just ate me. Oh, what the fuck was that? Bro, you got so many moves. Like,

822
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:25,209
I have no idea what's going on at the time. He's made out of like clay or something.

823
02:26:27,139 --> 02:26:34,739
I don't know the lore behind Adventure Time like that. All right. Good. Oh, no. I'm failing.

824
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:38,260
Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him.

825
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:43,219
He's a weak link. He's a weak link. Get away from him. No, I'm the weak link.

826
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:57,989
Oh, my goodness. Oh, God. Don't pull off. Don't pull off. How are you doing that? How are you

827
02:26:57,989 --> 02:27:03,989
doing that? Just crush him with the fucking iron.

828
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:21,270
Oh, excuse me. That was fucking fake. What happened? I did a clip in like 0.25 speed.

829
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:25,670
What was that? I don't even know what happened. What happened? Did we lose?

830
02:27:28,549 --> 02:27:36,219
What actually happened? I saw toast fall, you falling and then toast back on the main stage

831
02:27:36,219 --> 02:27:41,420
and then we won. Yeah. What was that? Was that like, okay, that was unironically Japanese ping,

832
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:50,309
I think. I saw myself winning. You guys saw that, right? Like I saw me kicking toast off.

833
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:57,030
No. I have no idea what happened. It was fun, though. Whatever it was.

834
02:27:57,829 --> 02:28:02,389
Yo, guys. GGs, though. I'm going to chill here. Yo, I'm down to play if you guys are on another

835
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:07,909
time or something. Yeah, good play. Until next time. Nice meeting you guys. GGs. Have a good one.

836
02:28:07,909 --> 02:28:12,549
Yeah, good game. This was wonderful. Once again, thank you, Lyric. Have a good one. By the way,

837
02:28:12,549 --> 02:28:17,190
guys, they're doing multiverses. Make sure you experience more multiverses on their channel.

838
02:28:18,069 --> 02:28:24,520
That's right. Who else is still staying? Who's still playing? I'm good for a little while.

839
02:28:25,239 --> 02:28:32,500
I love this game. I'll keep playing. We can't do like, we do 2v1, give toast a chance to.

840
02:28:33,139 --> 02:28:39,379
No, I'm not that good. Bro, what do you mean? You're cracked, bro. You got 300 damage. What

841
02:28:39,379 --> 02:28:47,000
the fuck is going on right now? I played during the last beta. Wait, really? There was another beta?

842
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:53,590
Yeah, there was. Yeah, there was the early alpha. Oh, wait. Play with moist critical. Is he playing?

843
02:28:54,309 --> 02:29:01,430
Oh, Charlie is like insane. Is he cracked out? Yeah, he has like at least 100 hours.

844
02:29:02,389 --> 02:29:09,370
Okay. I don't even know how. This game is not even out yet. Let me see. Is he live right now?

845
02:29:09,370 --> 02:29:15,450
Is he in? I'm going to add him to the call. I mean, he owns a Smash team. So, right. Or not a

846
02:29:15,450 --> 02:29:22,809
Smash team. He owns a Rocket League team, right? He's an e-sports gamer. So what's what's his

847
02:29:22,809 --> 02:29:29,049
online? What's his plan? Play with Ludwig? No, I'm not going to play with Ludwig because I fucking

848
02:29:29,690 --> 02:29:35,690
text. I sent him a text message saying, do you want to play? Do you want to play multiverses?

849
02:29:35,690 --> 02:29:41,799
And he did not respond to me. Oh, moist and letter playing. All right. Okay. Nevermind.

850
02:29:41,799 --> 02:29:46,120
Now I'm going to step out and do some solo practice and you guys take the 2v2.

851
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:50,620
Okay. Very good. It was good to play with you though.

852
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:55,899
Yeah. GG's guys. All right. GG's. Jeremy, do you want to keep playing?

853
02:29:55,899 --> 02:30:05,500
Yeah, I'm good to play. Let's do it. What up? How's it going? Oh, shit. Wait, did you add?

854
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:09,100
Wait, no, don't add Ludwig to the group, dude. Don't do that. What are you talking about? Why?

855
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:14,379
I hate that guy. Why? What's wrong with you? I'm kidding, man. What are you talking about?

856
02:30:14,379 --> 02:30:17,739
Thanks for responding to my text message asking you to play video games together.

857
02:30:17,899 --> 02:30:22,569
It's not a big deal, but hey, here to play against you two. Hassan, I'm sorry. I just

858
02:30:22,569 --> 02:30:25,860
didn't think it was real. I thought you were hacked. Wait, what do you mean?

859
02:30:26,819 --> 02:30:31,620
I just couldn't believe that you were playing a video game. Hey, how is not having drops on

860
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:37,700
YouTube? Is that cool? You don't speak to my teammate that way. How's that?

861
02:30:38,979 --> 02:30:43,459
In the fucking ring, bro. No, no, no, no, no, no shot. You're like a fucking sweaty

862
02:30:43,459 --> 02:30:48,340
smash player. And so is Charlie. We have to separate the teams. Hassan Hassan.

863
02:30:48,340 --> 02:30:52,979
This is not smash. This is multiverses, by the way. I know. But like, you know,

864
02:30:52,979 --> 02:30:56,659
they're different games is what you didn't recognize that Jerma did. Idiot.

865
02:30:57,379 --> 02:31:03,780
Okay. By the way, we got my Bugs Bunny. I've been working. I want to free for all actually

866
02:31:03,780 --> 02:31:09,610
against all of these pros. So I've never played the game and I'm playing on keyboard mouse.

867
02:31:09,610 --> 02:31:17,129
Just play us in in in stuck it up. Do I do I have can I do it? How do we invite people?

868
02:31:17,129 --> 02:31:20,809
Oh, yeah. Would you write your usernames in there so I can invite you?

869
02:31:20,809 --> 02:31:25,530
My username is air coots 31. Okay, just write it because I don't know how to spell.

870
02:31:25,530 --> 02:31:32,180
Nobody add me except for Hassan in Jerma. Okay, I have no idea how to.

871
02:31:32,180 --> 02:31:39,770
It's air A.I.R. Okay, I'm just adding voice. Oh, T.S. Oh, wait, we can do it off steam. I think

872
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:46,420
it has to be WB name. Yeah, you have to be in game and give WB just one more time.

873
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:52,790
Those air coots 31. No, I'm searching. I'm searching moist and adding him.

874
02:31:52,790 --> 02:31:59,899
I well, I don't know why everything you do is offensive, but it is moist. I sent you a request.

875
02:31:59,899 --> 02:32:04,500
All right. Are we doing free for all? Are we doing to be too? No, we're doing to be too.

876
02:32:06,659 --> 02:32:10,950
What do you guys means? Shaggy Shaggy. Oh, I'm Shaggy. Oh, what?

877
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:16,950
Oh, no. No, we're going to get so we're going to get three Shaggy players here.

878
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:22,569
Three Shaggy players. I'll switch. I'll switch. Who's your second? Okay. Okay. Okay. I am going

879
02:32:22,569 --> 02:32:30,420
to add moist to the lobby. I'm doing it. I'm adding moist to lobby. You moisture. You got a request.

880
02:32:31,459 --> 02:32:36,659
I'm coming. And then I'll bring in Ludwig. Okay. Oh, actually, he came with me. Are we both here?

881
02:32:37,299 --> 02:32:46,569
No, I'm not seeing him. Add me. Oh, you're right. Okay, I got him. You should play as the WB frog.

882
02:32:46,569 --> 02:32:49,690
All right. The second day, the second they add that, that's my main for the rest of my life.

883
02:32:50,250 --> 02:32:57,559
Actually, a great main air coots 31. Shocker. Was it hard to spell? Come on.

884
02:32:58,360 --> 02:33:02,469
I don't know what you meant when you said air coots. I thought it was like,

885
02:33:02,469 --> 02:33:07,270
like E R K U T. Like, I don't know. It could be so many different ways. I don't know what the

886
02:33:07,270 --> 02:33:13,110
fuck air coots is. I don't know why you make things difficult. I'm sorry. I did not realize

887
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:23,559
that you, you know, have a named it after your cat, which was also once on mogul money.

888
02:33:23,559 --> 02:33:26,920
Dude, I know what I want to drink, like a like a 32 ounce Gatorade right now.

889
02:33:27,879 --> 02:33:34,920
Okay, let's do it. So bad. Let's are we are we ready to go? And I'm talking about the gross

890
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:39,000
orange one. You know what I mean? Am I the one who, am I the one who's controlling?

891
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Am I the one who's controlling the lobby? No, no, no. Jermez Jermez. Oh shit. Okay.

892
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:47,049
Are we good with this, this format? Yeah, this works. This will work. All right, cool. Let's

893
02:33:47,049 --> 02:33:57,110
just do it. I used to, after soccer practice, suck down a Snapple in about three seconds. Oh

894
02:33:57,110 --> 02:34:04,090
God. That's big. That's awesome. What kind of Snapple? What kind of Snapple? Yeah, there's

895
02:34:04,090 --> 02:34:11,000
like 500 flavors. Wait, there's like a, there's like a main one. There's like the Snapple,

896
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:19,530
like Apple. Is it, is that it? There's like a main, like the original Snapple. I always thought

897
02:34:19,530 --> 02:34:26,969
that it was kind of like, it was 12, 20 different flavors. I think there are, but like, it's like,

898
02:34:27,930 --> 02:34:33,829
I think there are, but I think there's a main one. Is it peach? I think it is Apple, right? It's

899
02:34:33,829 --> 02:34:39,270
in the name, isn't it? Wait, we have odds in the chat right now. Will Lassan and Jermez win? No has

900
02:34:39,270 --> 02:34:45,430
9 million points and yes has 1 million or 10 million points now. I will, I'd like it to be

901
02:34:45,430 --> 02:34:50,629
known in the, the alpha for this. I was ranked 1000 in the top thousand across the whole game.

902
02:34:50,629 --> 02:34:56,709
I am, I am going to shut my fucking mouth and try as hard as I can. Oh, I'm sweating. I'm,

903
02:34:56,709 --> 02:35:02,389
I'm actually out here to prove a point. Don't embarrass me. Don't, don't embarrass me in front

904
02:35:02,389 --> 02:35:08,309
of, in front of Jermez. I'm in here with a bad attitude and something to prove. So I'm coming

905
02:35:08,309 --> 02:35:13,989
at you hot. Why dude? Come on. I'm not a gamer. I have never played and I'm on keyboard mouse.

906
02:35:13,989 --> 02:35:22,489
So I'm not feeling particularly, um, confident. We're going to get forward. No, no, no. If we get

907
02:35:22,489 --> 02:35:33,450
one kill, it's a wait, he's already sandwiching it. I don't even know how that happened. I just

908
02:35:33,450 --> 02:35:46,309
got intimidated. Yeah, I'll do that to you. That's my hidden passive. Your other hidden passive is

909
02:35:46,309 --> 02:35:52,069
like looking like me and my boomer brain doesn't comprehend that. You know what I mean? God damn

910
02:35:52,069 --> 02:36:00,569
right. It's my camouflage. I'm just going to chill here for a while. You got this. Whoa,

911
02:36:00,649 --> 02:36:18,620
God damn it. How does that not kill you? How does that not kill you? I just dodged.

912
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:26,299
Are you guys going to do this again on the 25th or 26th? Yep. 20. Yeah. Yeah. 26. Okay. Well,

913
02:36:27,479 --> 02:36:32,280
we better start by then. By then I'll practice and get so much better. Wait, can we? Oh no.

914
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:41,780
Germa is so slippery. It's nuts. I just, I'm tossing us on like a rag doll.

915
02:36:42,739 --> 02:36:54,500
Yeah. It's because I can't hit women. That's why I just. Oh my balloons. Oh my gosh. Get the

916
02:36:54,500 --> 02:37:10,739
double, get the double, get the double. Germa's nuts. Fuck. No. My God. What are you doing? What

917
02:37:10,739 --> 02:37:15,780
is that even doing? Oh, Germa. He was fucking with my brain. He was fucking with my brain.

918
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:25,299
We're in a good spot here though. Oh shit. I thought I'd make things a little spicy.

919
02:37:26,659 --> 02:37:48,889
Good news. The fuse is lit. Oh, that's safe. Shaggy. I love that safe. It's so fun. Come on.

920
02:37:48,889 --> 02:38:01,270
Oh my God. My tactic almost played off. What? Yo, we're good. We're good. There was no problem.

921
02:38:01,989 --> 02:38:07,590
Oh, I jumped away. Oh, that was so clutch. Oh my God. I was fucking. Oh my God. I was looking at

922
02:38:07,590 --> 02:38:16,229
moist. What the fuck? I'm sorry, Germa. That's too fucking. Okay. Okay. I died twice for no

923
02:38:16,229 --> 02:38:22,069
fucking reason. I died twice for no fucking reason. Still got more damage than Eric Coot's over there.

924
02:38:22,069 --> 02:38:26,629
Why does it say I got the least damage? I was wondering that. Is that? It's a known bug, known

925
02:38:26,629 --> 02:38:31,190
bug. Okay. That makes sense. Oh, is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's crazy. Oh,

926
02:38:31,190 --> 02:38:37,430
yeah. That's something with the mouse. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense. Because when you left

927
02:38:37,430 --> 02:38:41,750
click, the inputs are a little off. The known bug is just being bad at playing games. I'm playing

928
02:38:41,750 --> 02:38:49,350
Batman my main now. Prepare for my dectifying exit. My boy. Hey, you still good on Shaggy or

929
02:38:49,350 --> 02:38:56,090
you're going to walk off the stage another three times? Oh, come on, dude. Come on. See the guys,

930
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:59,370
we had something great. Okay. You know what? I'm going to go with iron giant. Fuck it.

931
02:39:02,299 --> 02:39:08,379
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. He's not. You are bad and you should quit. Yeah. I know I'm bad.

932
02:39:08,379 --> 02:39:14,139
I know I'm bad. Okay. I'm very upset about it. You know, going normie shit. Germa's very competitive

933
02:39:14,139 --> 02:39:18,219
and you don't recognize it. I do recognize it. I've been, I've been trying to impress him this

934
02:39:18,219 --> 02:39:22,219
entire time. Like I've literally, that's the only reason I was doing all right. I'll be really

935
02:39:22,219 --> 02:39:26,540
completely upfront. You said you, can I go back? I want to try Superman again.

936
02:39:28,299 --> 02:39:35,739
We can't go back. I don't have any perks. He didn't even do the tutorial and we dug down.

937
02:39:36,940 --> 02:39:41,739
He's been playing actually really well to be honest. Thank you. Is that who you've fought

938
02:39:41,739 --> 02:39:46,540
before? Yeah. But toast was actually kind of cracked and also Japanese bank saved him twice.

939
02:39:47,579 --> 02:39:52,500
Okay. One time it definitely saved them. Like that's not even a joke. Like we beat his ass and

940
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:59,620
then the game just delivered him the w for no reason. Was that a frog? What the hell was that?

941
02:39:59,620 --> 02:40:05,850
No, it's just what I thought of that statement to be honest. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. All

942
02:40:05,850 --> 02:40:10,090
right. Let's pull it together. Okay. I have no, I have no dog in this. I have no state. Okay. I'm

943
02:40:10,090 --> 02:40:26,229
not good. I know I'm not good. Oh my God. I'm not letting you up. Excuse me. Wait, why am I not able

944
02:40:26,229 --> 02:40:34,709
to hit you? That makes no sense. Good grab. You said fire giant. I hit the iron one. I said fire

945
02:40:34,709 --> 02:40:54,739
giant. Whoa. Ooh, easy. That was nasty. The thing about me is I do nasty things. Nice. Well, that

946
02:40:54,739 --> 02:41:16,170
was nice. Shit. Oh, what the fuck? Oh God. If you were like one second sooner, Jerma, I was dead.

947
02:41:17,930 --> 02:41:31,299
I killed you to be honest. Me? Yeah. No. No, I was weak when you threw me and you were in range.

948
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:42,780
Honestly, the whole time. Yikes. Oh, come on. I was on the screen still. Yeah. How do you like that?

949
02:41:42,780 --> 02:41:48,860
The taste of defeat? I mean, we just need to work on Ludd's recovery. I think it will be golden.

950
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:52,620
I don't even know what that means. Someone in the chat was saying that to me and I have no idea what

951
02:41:52,620 --> 02:42:01,100
those words mean. Oh my God. I killed you. I'm so sorry. I don't know how to explain that.

952
02:42:01,100 --> 02:42:06,139
Is that what happened? Yeah. And you didn't move and it killed you. You had like 50 seconds to

953
02:42:06,139 --> 02:42:12,780
walk forward. That was so funny. I don't even know what that was. I was just like flying.

954
02:42:13,340 --> 02:42:18,549
You were in slow motion. Dude, that was slow motion, man. That was so funny.

955
02:42:19,430 --> 02:42:36,280
The joint! The iron joint! The iron joint's got me! There we go. Wait, what? How did that? Oh,

956
02:42:36,280 --> 02:42:43,750
shit! What happened to you at the end? We needed that. No match-up knowledge doesn't

957
02:42:43,750 --> 02:42:49,030
gain plus ratio. Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing. I might say most damage to me. Dude, I

958
02:42:49,030 --> 02:42:53,270
didn't do any damage. It looks like the glitch got fixed because I'm not last this time by a

959
02:42:53,270 --> 02:42:59,750
point. Oh, that's crazy that you outdid. You outdid yourself by one damage. It usually lasts for

960
02:42:59,750 --> 02:43:03,350
like one game lead, so it should be fine now, I think. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. I think you

961
02:43:03,350 --> 02:43:06,709
infected my computer, by the way. Like it's not, it's kind of annoying. It does feel like that.

962
02:43:09,559 --> 02:43:13,959
I have, you guys have cleaned out the believers. Okay. They're done. They do not believe in me any

963
02:43:13,959 --> 02:43:20,120
longer. Are you happy? No, no, I'm not. That doesn't make me feel good. Okay, good. Then go

964
02:43:20,120 --> 02:43:23,879
easy on me this round. Okay. All right, I'm playing. Oh wait, do I have enough for Finn?

965
02:43:25,719 --> 02:43:32,860
The street still believe in you, I can confirm. Thank God. I should play Jake. Would I like Jake?

966
02:43:33,940 --> 02:43:37,940
Jake's pretty cool. Jake used to be kind of busted in the tech test. I don't know if he still is.

967
02:43:37,940 --> 02:43:46,469
What's Jake? From adventure. You don't know Adventure Time? Oh, okay. Dude, that you riding

968
02:43:46,469 --> 02:43:52,440
the rocket up to death is replaying in my head over and over again. I'm going to be thinking

969
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:57,239
about that like all night. That was kind of traumatic to witness. I'm not going to lie.

970
02:43:57,239 --> 02:44:03,500
It just hurt my feelings and he wasn't even on my team. He's just going, what's happening?

971
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:08,540
What's happening? It's just floating up to death. Yeah. You, I mean, you cooked me, but it's all good.

972
02:44:10,620 --> 02:44:13,659
They need all the advantage that you get. You know what I'm saying? Like we got it.

973
02:44:14,299 --> 02:44:20,649
Hey, you, you are golden Superman at this point, so we're good. These have been close games. I mean,

974
02:44:21,209 --> 02:44:26,440
we were on last stock. All right. This is, we're playing for real now. Let's do it.

975
02:44:27,079 --> 02:44:32,840
Yeah. Yeah. No, no. The training, the training wheels are off. I'm, I'm, you know, pulling on,

976
02:44:32,840 --> 02:44:46,950
I'm taking out the weights, the sandbags. This is the good song. Yeah, this is the good song.

977
02:44:46,950 --> 02:45:01,239
I love the song. Can you guys hear me? Yeah. Oh my God. I'm getting absolutely slammed and jammed

978
02:45:01,239 --> 02:45:16,379
over here. My bombs already. I'm a better superhero than Batman. No, you're not. What are these

979
02:45:16,379 --> 02:45:30,120
coins? Oh shit. Oh, I'm weakening the pootie out of these two. Holy. What's my finisher? Like,

980
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:37,319
how do you do a finisher? I, I think it's only for certain players. Yeah. Some people actually have

981
02:45:37,319 --> 02:45:53,690
one. What the fuck, dude? It's called the tornado. I'm enraged. Yeah. Oh, you snuck away. You snuck by

982
02:45:53,690 --> 02:46:07,030
that. God damn right. Maybe my recovery is nasty. Recover this. I'll never find me here.

983
02:46:07,750 --> 02:46:22,700
Oh, he found me. Wait, how? That's fucking me. That was me. Spacing, bro.

984
02:46:23,819 --> 02:46:29,750
Having a hard time. I'm not going to lie. It doesn't feel as good as he did back in the alpha.

985
02:46:29,750 --> 02:46:40,389
Get him in the sandwich. I'm not sure. Oh, how did I miss? I'm warming up the fin.

986
02:46:41,750 --> 02:46:44,709
Wait, what? How does that even happen? I don't understand.

987
02:46:45,670 --> 02:46:49,909
Like when I'm, when I'm flying towards you with an attack, how does that not work?

988
02:46:55,420 --> 02:47:00,299
I don't know what spacing means. You have a certain distance that your moves travel

989
02:47:00,299 --> 02:47:07,979
and you're doing it too far away. How about that? Did I travel well? I'm starting to lag a little

990
02:47:07,979 --> 02:47:17,350
bit. Oh, come on, Gwyn. No, no. How is he still alive? I don't know in my, in my up airs.

991
02:47:19,190 --> 02:47:27,450
It's been absolutely got here. Okay, German killed himself. My controller.

992
02:47:34,649 --> 02:47:37,690
Hey, what are coming? Gifted subs are coming. Hey, we appreciate that.

993
02:47:38,250 --> 02:47:49,209
Fucking. Dude, blame the USB mini standard. Okay. The USB standard. I will keep it a stack.

994
02:47:49,209 --> 02:47:57,930
Hassan. It was just superhero gap. Yeah. Oh, oh, you were worse today.

995
02:48:03,059 --> 02:48:08,420
Only an amateur blames his tools as they say. Dude, only, only a professional. I don't know

996
02:48:08,420 --> 02:48:15,700
what happened. I am. I blame my fucking tools. That's how you did. Great. Believe in yourself.

997
02:48:15,700 --> 02:48:22,260
The USB micro standard. The thing is like a toothpick that sticks in it. No, it it's unbelievable.

998
02:48:23,139 --> 02:48:26,420
My controller unplugged itself and I walked off twice.

999
02:48:29,639 --> 02:48:32,280
It's just better tactics. I think is what it boils down to.

1000
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:46,180
Oh crap. Crap. By the way, July 26th open beta begins. If you have drops. Good call.

1001
02:48:46,180 --> 02:48:52,920
Also, thank you. Warner Brothers for sponsoring this stream. Absolutely. Damn.

1002
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:59,159
Lud, you're not even saying that ever, dude. What's going on? He's muted right now. I don't know.

1003
02:48:59,159 --> 02:49:03,239
He's focusing. He's muted. I think he's probably saying that right now. That's why.

1004
02:49:03,479 --> 02:49:09,510
No, actually cool though. Cross progression, cross play, cross everything. That's cool.

1005
02:49:09,510 --> 02:49:14,549
Boys, the plan is simple. We're going to beat the doors off of Ludwig today.

1006
02:49:15,270 --> 02:49:20,520
Now, let's get in the hang of it now. Just give him. He just needed like four matches to warm up.

1007
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:24,600
Now he's going to go nuts. If I walk off the edge one more time, I'm going to eat this controller.

1008
02:49:27,079 --> 02:49:39,770
Oh, I can't believe I still hit Jerma. You make me sick.

1009
02:49:39,850 --> 02:49:51,500
You make me sick. Dude, just wait till they add Daffy Duck. What are these gold coins doing?

1010
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:59,479
Is that your character? Is that Jay? Oh, what? Wait, did Jerma die again? My controller. USB

1011
02:49:59,479 --> 02:50:16,709
standard. USB mini standard. We take that. Oh my God. You just styled on me. That was kind of big.

1012
02:50:16,709 --> 02:50:32,809
Yeah. I got you with a nasty combo. Oh, you just repeat it. I thought you were going to grab the

1013
02:50:32,809 --> 02:50:43,899
edge. Your spacing is trash, right? Your spacing is trash. No, don't make me do this. Oh, they have

1014
02:50:43,899 --> 02:50:48,620
specific voice lines against each other. Oh, and it was disgusting what you just did to me. Oh,

1015
02:50:48,620 --> 02:50:53,579
it was disgusting. It was disgusting. I chased it down, baby. This is a blowout and I hate it.

1016
02:50:56,379 --> 02:51:01,340
If Jerma's controller wasn't broken, you guys would be so dead. Not even funny. It would be

1017
02:51:01,340 --> 02:51:06,459
sad how badly we'd be beating you. I'll keep it a stack. If Charlie teamed with Jerma,

1018
02:51:06,459 --> 02:51:11,420
you would still lose. Wait, really? Oh, well, yeah, you are the worst player on the map.

1019
02:51:14,059 --> 02:51:21,940
And Charlie is the best. No, you. Good response, bro. You're bad.

1020
02:51:23,879 --> 02:51:27,819
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me. I'm coming. Oh, God.

1021
02:51:28,700 --> 02:51:37,370
What the fuck did I throw off the cliff for? Oh, I almost had you red. Oh, yeah, I'm terrified.

1022
02:51:37,370 --> 02:51:42,969
I'm actually terrified of you right now because I don't want to lose the game. Oh, my. What? Wait,

1023
02:51:42,969 --> 02:51:48,809
what? Why did I fall off? I fucking melted you, bro. No, you didn't. Jerma died. That's the same

1024
02:51:48,809 --> 02:51:53,209
thing. It doesn't matter. You were fucking trash. Let's look at your damage. Look at your damage.

1025
02:51:55,610 --> 02:52:01,850
It's better than you. It's better than you. No, it's worse than the wood. I crushed you, bro.

1026
02:52:01,850 --> 02:52:08,569
I'm getting super glue and I'm super glue in this USB micro. 381 damage every more than all of us

1027
02:52:08,569 --> 02:52:15,209
combined. Gorilla. This is my shit. I'm just kind of nasty at these kind of games. I'm not going to

1028
02:52:15,209 --> 02:52:22,809
lie. OK, OK, OK. What do we let's do one more. One more to be to. We've got to try to pull this back.

1029
02:52:24,520 --> 02:52:27,559
All right. One more to be to one more to be. Then we can try some frieze. Sounds good.

1030
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:35,700
I'm going to accidentally gorilla glue my hands to this controller. At some point, I have to one

1031
02:52:35,700 --> 02:52:41,059
of you when you has on. Why is my dude? I'm so down. I mean, you're going to be on the keyboard,

1032
02:52:41,059 --> 02:53:03,590
right? Yeah. OK, good. I think I'm going to change it up here. Oh, man. This is a bold move. I think

1033
02:53:03,590 --> 02:53:08,309
it's I think so. We're playing as the we get 20 percent more damage if we play with the same

1034
02:53:08,309 --> 02:53:15,590
characters from the same universe. Oh, you're playing as Jake? Yeah. Oh, that'll boy. Jake's

1035
02:53:15,590 --> 02:53:20,709
good. I was just trying to mess with you. I'm not playing with Jake. Oh, you just like what you told

1036
02:53:20,709 --> 02:53:25,829
a lie. We're playing with the mystery machine group. Oh, it's kind of fucked up, though, to lie.

1037
02:53:25,829 --> 02:53:31,770
Oh, my God. OK, I was I'm a liar. I thought it was friendly art of war.

1038
02:53:33,459 --> 02:53:38,500
You guys know why my when I all tab it state it's like sticks.

1039
02:53:40,549 --> 02:53:43,190
Oh, are you and when you are you in windowed full screen?

1040
02:53:44,729 --> 02:53:49,450
No, when I all tab it just like shows the all the fucking instead of like showing it for a

1041
02:53:49,450 --> 02:53:55,340
second for the duration of the all tab it just like it just has all of my programs right there

1042
02:53:56,540 --> 02:54:02,579
on screen. Are you playing in full screen mode or windowed mode? I think I'm playing on.

1043
02:54:03,379 --> 02:54:09,559
Never mind. It's fine. We'll figure it out. All right. See if we can pull this out here.

1044
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:15,959
Oh, this is a good map. I hate this map. You press windows tab instead of all that.

1045
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:36,760
What's the tech button? Is it just watch? Yeah, it's dodge. Oh, man, German slippery.

1046
02:54:36,760 --> 02:54:44,579
He's amazing. I'm ashamed. Who is the development? The Shaggy shit. Shaggy shit. Oh, that's really.

1047
02:54:44,579 --> 02:54:48,579
That's weird. Who are you talking about? You say who's amazing on the Shaggy shit.

1048
02:54:48,579 --> 02:54:51,540
That's crazy because you thought it was German and you were complimenting Shaggy.

1049
02:54:51,540 --> 02:54:54,340
And now you realize it's me. No, I think it's really bad.

1050
02:54:56,579 --> 02:54:58,340
That's so weird that you feel that way because.

1051
02:54:58,739 --> 02:55:07,899
Oh, my God. Guys, clip that clip that Ludwig professional Smash Bros player

1052
02:55:07,899 --> 02:55:27,180
said that I was amazing on Shaggy. I'll take it. Oh, come on. Oh, how did you survive that?

1053
02:55:27,819 --> 02:55:33,180
I don't know. I'm not going to lie at that for sure. I was dead. How is she dodging everything?

1054
02:55:33,340 --> 02:55:34,059
The double kill.

1055
02:55:41,100 --> 02:55:42,459
Getting double sucked.

1056
02:55:45,819 --> 02:55:51,260
It's not canon. They don't say that. The show. They do. They do, dude.

1057
02:55:52,459 --> 02:55:56,379
Are we just OP because we're playing canonical characters like literally tie

1058
02:55:56,379 --> 02:55:59,500
20% more damage, dude. They don't know that same universe.

1059
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:04,549
There's nobody in the Batman universe here.

1060
02:56:04,549 --> 02:56:07,579
Superman?

1061
02:56:07,579 --> 02:56:09,139
Yeah, they're in the same universe.

1062
02:56:09,139 --> 02:56:10,159
Are they?

1063
02:56:10,159 --> 02:56:10,979
Yeah.

1064
02:56:10,979 --> 02:56:12,159
Is it, like, is it?

1065
02:56:12,159 --> 02:56:13,899
Metropolis isn't this?

1066
02:56:13,899 --> 02:56:18,989
Well, Metropolis is always referenced in Gotham.

1067
02:56:18,989 --> 02:56:24,780
Oh my god, Jerm is nasty on this Velma.

1068
02:56:24,780 --> 02:56:30,639
Oh, I gotta get that call in.

1069
02:56:30,639 --> 02:56:39,540
Oh shit, that's basing.

1070
02:56:39,540 --> 02:56:41,860
Dude, you have dodged so many times, I don't know why.

1071
02:56:41,860 --> 02:56:43,500
Oh boy!

1072
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:44,340
I don't know how you keep a voice.

1073
02:56:44,340 --> 02:56:45,899
My body!

1074
02:56:45,899 --> 02:56:47,459
Let's go!

1075
02:56:47,459 --> 02:56:49,459
Let's fucking go!

1076
02:56:49,459 --> 02:56:51,420
Every hole filled at the end there.

1077
02:56:51,420 --> 02:56:53,860
I could not recover on that.

1078
02:56:53,860 --> 02:56:56,659
Jerma was popping for a minute.

1079
02:56:56,659 --> 02:56:58,979
Dude, that was incredible, Jerma.

1080
02:56:58,979 --> 02:57:00,659
That was a clinic.

1081
02:57:00,659 --> 02:57:01,500
Oh my god.

1082
02:57:01,500 --> 02:57:02,340
Hey, come on.

1083
02:57:02,340 --> 02:57:03,500
That was a fucking clinic.

1084
02:57:03,500 --> 02:57:07,239
Wait, Ludwig, I think your bug is back on.

1085
02:57:07,239 --> 02:57:12,250
Yeah, I gotta just...

1086
02:57:12,250 --> 02:57:13,409
Yeah, just check the forums real quick.

1087
02:57:13,409 --> 02:57:14,610
I'm sure they have a solution.

1088
02:57:14,610 --> 02:57:15,850
This game is fun, man.

1089
02:57:15,850 --> 02:57:17,309
This game is fun.

1090
02:57:17,309 --> 02:57:18,690
This is a lot of fun, yeah.

1091
02:57:19,290 --> 02:57:21,809
Especially Victory, the sweet nectar.

1092
02:57:21,809 --> 02:57:24,090
Oh, yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.

1093
02:57:24,090 --> 02:57:24,930
You know what, I don't...

1094
02:57:24,930 --> 02:57:25,770
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.

1095
02:57:25,770 --> 02:57:27,809
Wait, wait, wait, I gotta mention something here.

1096
02:57:27,809 --> 02:57:29,930
Stop yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.

1097
02:57:29,930 --> 02:57:32,809
Okay, will Jerma, will Hasana Jerma win?

1098
02:57:32,809 --> 02:57:37,809
Yes, got fucking four million points and no 29 million.

1099
02:57:38,049 --> 02:57:40,010
Oh, what a big believer moment.

1100
02:57:40,010 --> 02:57:41,770
When was the last time you guys drank a Trenta

1101
02:57:41,770 --> 02:57:42,649
from Starbucks?

1102
02:57:44,329 --> 02:57:46,649
I've actually never ordered one ever.

1103
02:57:46,649 --> 02:57:47,489
I did one of those today.

1104
02:57:47,489 --> 02:57:48,329
I've never even heard of it.

1105
02:57:48,969 --> 02:57:50,180
You've never ordered what?

1106
02:57:50,180 --> 02:57:51,299
You ordered one?

1107
02:57:51,299 --> 02:57:54,020
This is like the secret large.

1108
02:57:54,020 --> 02:57:55,260
It's 32 ounces.

1109
02:57:58,969 --> 02:58:00,370
What did you order?

1110
02:58:00,370 --> 02:58:03,600
It's a Trenta.

1111
02:58:03,600 --> 02:58:05,159
Choose your character.

1112
02:58:05,159 --> 02:58:06,280
I have no idea what that is.

1113
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:11,040
Okay, Starbucks has tall, grande, and venti, right?

1114
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:13,399
That's small, medium, large, but you can order a Trenta

1115
02:58:13,399 --> 02:58:17,180
and it's an extra large, a 32 ounce iced coffee.

1116
02:58:17,180 --> 02:58:18,000
I love that.

1117
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:18,840
It's on the secret menu.

1118
02:58:18,840 --> 02:58:21,319
What's your Starbucks order?

1119
02:58:21,319 --> 02:58:22,860
Oh, bro.

1120
02:58:22,860 --> 02:58:27,500
Trenta, hazelnut iced coffee with three pumps.

1121
02:58:27,500 --> 02:58:28,620
Wait, this is a lie.

1122
02:58:28,620 --> 02:58:33,620
So Trenta iced coffee with three pumps of brown sugar syrup

1123
02:58:33,620 --> 02:58:35,899
with a splash of oat milk.

1124
02:58:35,899 --> 02:58:37,020
That's insane.

1125
02:58:37,020 --> 02:58:37,860
That's not bad.

1126
02:58:37,860 --> 02:58:38,680
Splash of oat milk is good though.

1127
02:58:38,680 --> 02:58:39,520
Good call on that.

1128
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:40,659
Hey, Lud, are you having a hard time

1129
02:58:40,659 --> 02:58:42,780
because there's no Jigglypuff in this game?

1130
02:58:42,780 --> 02:58:44,540
Dude, just because you know a reference

1131
02:58:44,540 --> 02:58:46,059
doesn't mean you need to say that a lot.

1132
02:58:46,059 --> 02:58:48,940
Oh, I'm sorry.

1133
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:51,819
Are you upset that I fucking nailed you?

1134
02:58:51,819 --> 02:58:52,700
It's okay.

1135
02:58:52,739 --> 02:58:55,139
All right, let's just put $5,000 on this one.

1136
02:58:55,139 --> 02:58:57,700
Wait, hold on, wait a minute.

1137
02:58:57,700 --> 02:58:59,020
Dude, okay, dude.

1138
02:58:59,020 --> 02:59:00,139
Are we on Taz?

1139
02:59:00,139 --> 02:59:00,979
This is between you two.

1140
02:59:00,979 --> 02:59:02,379
This is between you two.

1141
02:59:02,379 --> 02:59:03,219
Nevermind, he's on Taz.

1142
02:59:03,219 --> 02:59:04,059
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.

1143
02:59:04,059 --> 02:59:05,219
By the way, people are freaking out.

1144
02:59:05,219 --> 02:59:08,700
They think you get no sugar syrup in it.

1145
02:59:08,700 --> 02:59:11,219
You only get three pumps of brown sugar syrup.

1146
02:59:11,219 --> 02:59:12,260
Three pumps is standard.

1147
02:59:12,260 --> 02:59:13,979
They put three pumps in a grande normally.

1148
02:59:13,979 --> 02:59:15,340
We're playing friendly games

1149
02:59:15,340 --> 02:59:17,579
and Lud's like put $5,000 on.

1150
02:59:20,559 --> 02:59:22,319
No, there's no classic in here.

1151
02:59:22,319 --> 02:59:23,159
Excuse me.

1152
02:59:29,020 --> 02:59:31,739
That's the only way I got this one.

1153
02:59:31,739 --> 02:59:34,459
Oh my God, I didn't expect that.

1154
02:59:34,459 --> 02:59:36,639
Oh, best song of the game.

1155
02:59:36,639 --> 02:59:37,479
True.

1156
02:59:37,479 --> 02:59:38,299
What song is fire?

1157
02:59:38,299 --> 02:59:39,139
What is it from?

1158
02:59:39,139 --> 02:59:39,979
Steven Universe.

1159
02:59:39,979 --> 02:59:41,159
I think Steven Universe, yeah.

1160
02:59:41,159 --> 02:59:42,000
Yeah.

1161
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:42,819
Oh my God.

1162
02:59:48,090 --> 02:59:50,930
Oh my God, that tornado's disgusting.

1163
02:59:50,930 --> 02:59:52,010
Tornado's kind of nasty.

1164
02:59:52,010 --> 02:59:53,450
It's disgusting, it really is.

1165
02:59:53,450 --> 02:59:59,440
Just metanite.

1166
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:00,280
Oh shit.

1167
03:00:00,280 --> 03:00:01,120
Oh, chew him up.

1168
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:02,000
Wait, did you eat him?

1169
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:03,120
That's sick.

1170
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:04,040
It's hard to get though.

1171
03:00:04,040 --> 03:00:04,879
It's hard to do.

1172
03:00:09,950 --> 03:00:11,909
Oh boy, what a combo.

1173
03:00:11,909 --> 03:00:18,200
Tossed him right into it.

1174
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:23,819
What?

1175
03:00:23,819 --> 03:00:27,180
Oh, you slippery, slippery bastard.

1176
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:28,020
No.

1177
03:00:32,700 --> 03:00:34,700
Oh my God, he's got 152.

1178
03:00:40,129 --> 03:00:41,569
No way.

1179
03:00:41,569 --> 03:00:42,530
What the fuck?

1180
03:00:42,530 --> 03:00:46,350
No way.

1181
03:00:46,350 --> 03:00:47,510
Oh my God.

1182
03:00:47,510 --> 03:00:49,069
No, how?

1183
03:00:49,069 --> 03:00:51,110
With 158, how?

1184
03:00:51,110 --> 03:00:52,110
With a double KO?

1185
03:00:54,209 --> 03:00:56,010
Okay, we'll get fucked on that one.

1186
03:00:59,899 --> 03:01:01,579
Oh shit, that thing is bad.

1187
03:01:02,739 --> 03:01:04,780
I'm gonna get fucked on this, I think.

1188
03:01:12,020 --> 03:01:12,860
I can't believe that.

1189
03:01:12,860 --> 03:01:14,260
Peace.

1190
03:01:14,260 --> 03:01:15,100
Bitch.

1191
03:01:21,370 --> 03:01:22,649
Who said that?

1192
03:01:22,649 --> 03:01:23,489
That was Matt, man.

1193
03:01:23,489 --> 03:01:27,030
Oh, I thought that was Taz.

1194
03:01:27,030 --> 03:01:29,069
Imagine, Taz is full anime.

1195
03:01:29,069 --> 03:01:30,670
He just speaks full English.

1196
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:36,659
Wait, Taz can speak English, right?

1197
03:01:36,659 --> 03:01:37,819
No, isn't he gonna go like,

1198
03:01:37,819 --> 03:01:39,059
what the fuck?

1199
03:01:39,059 --> 03:01:41,860
No, he's like Scooby-Doo.

1200
03:01:41,860 --> 03:01:44,379
He's like, right, right, right, right, right, right.

1201
03:01:45,219 --> 03:01:47,020
Scooby-Doo does not speak full English.

1202
03:01:47,020 --> 03:01:48,219
Yes, he does.

1203
03:01:48,219 --> 03:01:49,299
He doesn't speak full English.

1204
03:01:49,299 --> 03:01:50,500
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1205
03:01:50,500 --> 03:01:53,059
He'll do like little grunts and then like throw in a word.

1206
03:01:53,059 --> 03:01:55,459
No, he's like, Taz want action.

1207
03:01:55,459 --> 03:01:57,260
Right, he says more shit.

1208
03:01:57,260 --> 03:01:59,739
He has never said, Taz want action.

1209
03:01:59,739 --> 03:02:00,579
Yes, he does.

1210
03:02:00,579 --> 03:02:01,420
I used to have a toy.

1211
03:02:01,420 --> 03:02:03,899
You pressed his chest and he went, Taz want action.

1212
03:02:05,659 --> 03:02:07,299
Taz want action.

1213
03:02:08,420 --> 03:02:10,459
I swear to God, somebody's gonna find a clip.

1214
03:02:18,690 --> 03:02:20,729
Oh, what the fuck?

1215
03:02:20,729 --> 03:02:21,569
Let's go.

1216
03:02:23,290 --> 03:02:26,510
No, no, no.

1217
03:02:26,510 --> 03:02:28,030
What the fuck was that?

1218
03:02:28,030 --> 03:02:29,829
Wait, is that Batman?

1219
03:02:29,829 --> 03:02:31,790
Or is that Tasmanian devil, for sure?

1220
03:02:33,059 --> 03:02:33,899
Definitely Batman.

1221
03:02:33,899 --> 03:02:37,020
Oh, that's scary.

1222
03:02:37,020 --> 03:02:39,020
Dude, you're abusing that, okay?

1223
03:02:39,020 --> 03:02:39,860
I absolutely am.

1224
03:02:39,860 --> 03:02:41,379
You're so abusing me.

1225
03:02:41,379 --> 03:02:42,940
What just happened?

1226
03:02:42,940 --> 03:02:45,709
No, baby, yeah.

1227
03:02:45,709 --> 03:02:46,950
Oh my God.

1228
03:02:46,950 --> 03:02:47,790
I couldn't jump.

1229
03:02:47,790 --> 03:02:50,389
Why did Batman say, you wanna slobber all over me?

1230
03:02:50,389 --> 03:02:51,790
It fucked me up a little bit.

1231
03:02:51,790 --> 03:02:54,629
To get to the other side.

1232
03:02:54,670 --> 03:02:56,389
I played so poorly that round.

1233
03:02:56,389 --> 03:02:58,309
I played so poorly.

1234
03:02:58,309 --> 03:02:59,149
Oh, scary.

1235
03:02:59,149 --> 03:03:00,829
I think we all did pretty good,

1236
03:03:00,829 --> 03:03:02,510
except for Ludwig, honestly.

1237
03:03:02,510 --> 03:03:05,190
I literally got more damage than no one.

1238
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:08,909
You got a KO than a Lud, that was crucial.

1239
03:03:08,909 --> 03:03:10,829
Lud, do you have a controller?

1240
03:03:10,829 --> 03:03:13,149
No, I do, but it won't connect.

1241
03:03:13,149 --> 03:03:13,989
I cannot figure out

1242
03:03:13,989 --> 03:03:15,670
how to get my Xbox controller to connect.

1243
03:03:15,670 --> 03:03:18,110
Is it the USB micro standard bullshit?

1244
03:03:18,110 --> 03:03:19,309
I have the controller.

1245
03:03:19,309 --> 03:03:20,229
I have plugged it in.

1246
03:03:20,229 --> 03:03:21,110
It is plugged in.

1247
03:03:21,110 --> 03:03:24,899
It just doesn't work.

1248
03:03:24,899 --> 03:03:26,620
You guys wanna do FFA?

1249
03:03:26,620 --> 03:03:27,459
Yeah, let's do it.

1250
03:03:27,459 --> 03:03:32,219
Let's go for it.

1251
03:03:32,219 --> 03:03:34,370
Okay, I gotta pee real quick.

1252
03:03:34,370 --> 03:03:35,450
Stop saying remove the batteries.

1253
03:03:35,450 --> 03:03:37,409
Choose your character.

1254
03:03:37,409 --> 03:03:38,930
Can we do a pee break?

1255
03:03:38,930 --> 03:03:40,329
You guys wanna do a pee break?

1256
03:03:40,329 --> 03:03:41,530
Uh.

1257
03:03:41,530 --> 03:03:42,889
You have 38 seconds.

1258
03:03:42,889 --> 03:03:44,090
After this we can.

1259
03:03:44,090 --> 03:03:44,930
Yeah.

1260
03:03:44,930 --> 03:03:45,969
It won't look any different

1261
03:03:45,969 --> 03:03:47,770
if you're playing or not today.

1262
03:03:47,770 --> 03:03:48,610
Okay.

1263
03:03:52,530 --> 03:03:55,459
I'm gonna try this dog.

1264
03:03:55,459 --> 03:03:59,020
Oh, the original content dog in here?

1265
03:03:59,020 --> 03:04:01,180
Yep, original content dog.

1266
03:04:01,180 --> 03:04:02,780
That guy's nuts, actually.

1267
03:04:02,780 --> 03:04:03,780
Is he good?

1268
03:04:03,819 --> 03:04:15,069
Yeah, he's actually really good.

1269
03:04:15,069 --> 03:04:17,920
Guarantee Hasan doesn't wash his hands.

1270
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:19,770
There's no time.

1271
03:04:19,770 --> 03:04:20,729
No, he'll do it.

1272
03:04:20,729 --> 03:04:26,670
He'll make it back.

1273
03:04:26,670 --> 03:04:28,950
Two shaggies.

1274
03:04:28,950 --> 03:04:31,780
Yeah, I'm busting out the main for this one.

1275
03:04:31,780 --> 03:04:33,530
Okay.

1276
03:04:33,530 --> 03:04:41,459
All right.

1277
03:04:41,459 --> 03:04:43,430
Did they both go pee?

1278
03:04:43,430 --> 03:04:47,379
I'm not sure.

1279
03:04:47,379 --> 03:04:49,780
So what's your assessment so far at this game?

1280
03:04:49,780 --> 03:04:50,620
Oh, I love the game.

1281
03:04:50,620 --> 03:04:52,739
I played it a lot during the tech test.

1282
03:04:52,739 --> 03:04:54,620
So I'm pretty well versed on it.

1283
03:04:54,620 --> 03:04:56,059
I think it's great.

1284
03:04:56,059 --> 03:04:57,540
I love the game.

1285
03:04:57,540 --> 03:04:59,899
And we're no longer in ad hours.

1286
03:04:59,899 --> 03:05:00,979
I'm not contractually,

1287
03:05:01,700 --> 03:05:03,260
I'm not contractually obligated to say that.

1288
03:05:03,260 --> 03:05:04,459
No, it's just a great game.

1289
03:05:04,459 --> 03:05:06,540
It's just an absolutely fun game.

1290
03:05:06,540 --> 03:05:07,379
Prepare yourself.

1291
03:05:07,379 --> 03:05:08,219
All right.

1292
03:05:08,219 --> 03:05:10,540
I had an argument with my chat about this.

1293
03:05:10,540 --> 03:05:11,979
Wait, what the fuck is that character?

1294
03:05:11,979 --> 03:05:13,299
What?

1295
03:05:13,299 --> 03:05:14,459
It's OC for the game.

1296
03:05:14,459 --> 03:05:15,940
You don't know Rain Dog?

1297
03:05:15,940 --> 03:05:18,260
You've never seen Rain Dog coming home?

1298
03:05:19,850 --> 03:05:20,690
How do you not know his name?

1299
03:05:20,690 --> 03:05:22,729
Grandma got run over by a Rain Dog?

1300
03:05:22,729 --> 03:05:24,770
You've never seen Rain Dog coming home?

1301
03:05:24,770 --> 03:05:26,770
I've never seen Rain Dog come anywhere.

1302
03:05:26,770 --> 03:05:28,850
It's like, it has like a hundred million views

1303
03:05:28,850 --> 03:05:40,209
or something, whatever.

1304
03:05:40,370 --> 03:05:42,250
Oh, I'm getting destroyed.

1305
03:05:47,790 --> 03:05:49,149
What the hell is that?

1306
03:05:49,149 --> 03:05:50,309
Oh shit.

1307
03:05:50,309 --> 03:05:59,659
Okay.

1308
03:05:59,659 --> 03:06:01,959
Oh, it's fire.

1309
03:06:01,959 --> 03:06:04,840
Yeah, you have like a projectile and then like a fire.

1310
03:06:04,840 --> 03:06:09,819
Why would I grab you?

1311
03:06:09,819 --> 03:06:11,700
Oh, come on.

1312
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:17,799
You're insecure.

1313
03:06:17,799 --> 03:06:18,639
That was an easy one.

1314
03:06:18,639 --> 03:06:19,479
You got it.

1315
03:06:19,479 --> 03:06:20,319
You're insecure.

1316
03:06:20,319 --> 03:06:21,159
I was working on him.

1317
03:06:21,159 --> 03:06:30,200
I haven't seen metahuman activity like that.

1318
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:33,209
Oh, the flank.

1319
03:06:33,209 --> 03:06:34,049
Yeah.

1320
03:06:34,209 --> 03:06:36,649
I think I got to take this guy into the lab.

1321
03:06:36,649 --> 03:06:37,489
No.

1322
03:06:37,489 --> 03:06:38,329
Wait, what?

1323
03:06:38,329 --> 03:06:39,530
Oh my God.

1324
03:06:39,530 --> 03:06:40,409
That was nasty.

1325
03:06:48,340 --> 03:06:49,620
What are you doing, Batman?

1326
03:06:49,620 --> 03:06:50,459
Oh, what the fuck?

1327
03:06:50,459 --> 03:06:51,299
How is that?

1328
03:06:51,299 --> 03:06:52,620
Oh, I'm so fucked, dude.

1329
03:06:52,620 --> 03:06:53,459
What the hell?

1330
03:06:53,459 --> 03:06:54,299
Why did I chase you?

1331
03:06:54,299 --> 03:06:55,139
Oh my Lord.

1332
03:06:55,139 --> 03:06:56,459
I can't believe it.

1333
03:06:56,459 --> 03:06:57,299
I'm killing myself.

1334
03:06:57,299 --> 03:06:59,659
Yo, can someone fucking kill Big Moist, please?

1335
03:06:59,659 --> 03:07:00,500
I just died twice.

1336
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:02,700
I've killed myself like twice now.

1337
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:05,620
Does that mean ring out double bonus though?

1338
03:07:05,620 --> 03:07:07,379
I don't, you're speaking gamer words

1339
03:07:07,379 --> 03:07:09,989
that not even I know.

1340
03:07:10,149 --> 03:07:16,969
Gamer words.

1341
03:07:16,969 --> 03:07:18,170
What is popping right now?

1342
03:07:18,170 --> 03:07:23,500
Oh my God.

1343
03:07:23,500 --> 03:07:26,500
Why do you get to kick when I pull?

1344
03:07:26,500 --> 03:07:28,340
Why?

1345
03:07:28,340 --> 03:07:29,180
I knew that.

1346
03:07:29,180 --> 03:07:31,379
Get ya.

1347
03:07:31,379 --> 03:07:32,940
Oh, you have 19 points?

1348
03:07:32,940 --> 03:07:34,260
Wait, did you get that one too?

1349
03:07:34,260 --> 03:07:35,100
Dude, what the fuck?

1350
03:07:35,100 --> 03:07:35,940
You already just got it.

1351
03:07:35,940 --> 03:07:36,780
What the hell?

1352
03:07:36,780 --> 03:07:37,620
23 points?

1353
03:07:37,620 --> 03:07:38,899
How?

1354
03:07:38,899 --> 03:07:39,979
I have zero.

1355
03:07:39,979 --> 03:07:40,819
What?

1356
03:07:40,819 --> 03:07:47,780
Even fucker controllers aren't even plugged in.

1357
03:07:47,780 --> 03:07:48,659
What?

1358
03:07:48,659 --> 03:07:49,620
I just killed myself.

1359
03:07:49,620 --> 03:07:50,579
I have zero points now.

1360
03:07:50,579 --> 03:07:51,420
Fuck me.

1361
03:07:51,420 --> 03:07:52,260
I'm worse than Ludd.

1362
03:07:52,260 --> 03:07:53,100
This is devastating.

1363
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:01,280
That felt good.

1364
03:08:01,280 --> 03:08:02,120
That was so bad.

1365
03:08:02,120 --> 03:08:02,959
I wonder who won that one.

1366
03:08:02,959 --> 03:08:08,940
That was so bad.

1367
03:08:08,940 --> 03:08:10,860
Oh man, you gotta love those kinds of matches.

1368
03:08:10,860 --> 03:08:11,700
I gotta tell ya.

1369
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:15,420
Dude, you are the king of kill stealing, Moist.

1370
03:08:15,420 --> 03:08:16,260
I don't know.

1371
03:08:16,260 --> 03:08:17,579
No, no, no, no.

1372
03:08:17,579 --> 03:08:19,219
The damage says otherwise.

1373
03:08:19,219 --> 03:08:20,500
Okay, bro.

1374
03:08:20,500 --> 03:08:22,700
Our damage is not even remotely close.

1375
03:08:22,700 --> 03:08:23,700
So yes, you are right.

1376
03:08:23,700 --> 03:08:26,059
But that was fun.

1377
03:08:26,059 --> 03:08:28,379
Yeah, I use numbers over here.

1378
03:08:28,379 --> 03:08:31,940
Is your bug also transferring over to your points as well

1379
03:08:31,940 --> 03:08:32,899
as your damage?

1380
03:08:34,319 --> 03:08:36,190
You wanna check that?

1381
03:08:36,190 --> 03:08:37,989
Choose your character.

1382
03:08:37,989 --> 03:08:39,389
That was nasty, by the way.

1383
03:08:39,389 --> 03:08:41,590
We got all, we got absolutely slam dunked on.

1384
03:08:41,590 --> 03:08:42,430
Ludd.

1385
03:08:42,430 --> 03:08:43,950
That was, yeah, that felt good.

1386
03:08:43,950 --> 03:08:44,790
It felt good for me.

1387
03:08:44,790 --> 03:08:47,489
That was a nice match.

1388
03:08:47,489 --> 03:08:48,969
All right, people want me to play as Jake.

1389
03:08:48,969 --> 03:08:51,180
I'll try it.

1390
03:08:51,180 --> 03:08:52,180
Is he don't-a-walling me

1391
03:08:52,180 --> 03:08:55,739
because he's the worst person on this lobby?

1392
03:08:55,739 --> 03:08:57,540
Just by being a sweaty smash player?

1393
03:08:57,540 --> 03:08:58,379
1v1 me.

1394
03:08:58,379 --> 03:09:00,219
1v1 me right now.

1395
03:09:00,219 --> 03:09:02,700
I will after we're done, you know,

1396
03:09:02,700 --> 03:09:04,540
after I'm done wiping the floors with you.

1397
03:09:04,540 --> 03:09:05,659
I would watch that.

1398
03:09:06,299 --> 03:09:07,139
I'd actually really like to watch that.

1399
03:09:07,139 --> 03:09:08,100
Is there spectators?

1400
03:09:08,100 --> 03:09:10,819
After I'm done whipping you like a towel?

1401
03:09:10,819 --> 03:09:12,620
I mean, we can do, we just do free for all

1402
03:09:12,620 --> 03:09:13,860
and we just stand away.

1403
03:09:13,860 --> 03:09:15,579
Oh, true, true, true.

1404
03:09:15,579 --> 03:09:16,739
Stand on the side.

1405
03:09:16,739 --> 03:09:18,420
Do you guys wanna hash that out right now?

1406
03:09:18,420 --> 03:09:19,260
You could.

1407
03:09:19,260 --> 03:09:20,430
Yeah, let's hash it out right now.

1408
03:09:20,430 --> 03:09:21,270
Let's hash it out right now.

1409
03:09:21,270 --> 03:09:22,110
Come on, big man.

1410
03:09:22,110 --> 03:09:22,950
Batman versus Superman.

1411
03:09:22,950 --> 03:09:23,790
Old school.

1412
03:09:23,790 --> 03:09:25,309
Okay, that's canonical.

1413
03:09:25,309 --> 03:09:27,950
Adventure time crew's just gonna hang out in the bleachers.

1414
03:09:27,950 --> 03:09:29,190
You're canonically dumb.

1415
03:09:29,190 --> 03:09:30,469
Oh, hey, Ludd, you gotta go like this.

1416
03:09:30,469 --> 03:09:31,709
Fucking so good, dude.

1417
03:09:31,709 --> 03:09:33,030
You're gonna go like what?

1418
03:09:33,430 --> 03:09:34,510
Do you believe?

1419
03:09:36,510 --> 03:09:37,950
Prepare yourself.

1420
03:09:37,950 --> 03:09:39,190
Are you doing Batman?

1421
03:09:39,190 --> 03:09:40,030
Yeah.

1422
03:09:41,110 --> 03:09:43,389
No, you gotta go, do you believe?

1423
03:09:47,010 --> 03:09:49,649
You know you're not doing it.

1424
03:09:49,649 --> 03:09:51,649
You sound like Batman as a stoma.

1425
03:09:52,569 --> 03:09:54,809
We can't do free for all when you guys stand on the sidelines

1426
03:09:54,809 --> 03:09:57,010
because accidentally we're gonna get points.

1427
03:09:57,010 --> 03:09:57,850
No, no, we're on the bottom.

1428
03:09:57,850 --> 03:09:58,690
We're on the bottom.

1429
03:09:58,690 --> 03:09:59,530
Yeah, here.

1430
03:09:59,530 --> 03:10:00,569
We'll come up, we'll come up.

1431
03:10:00,569 --> 03:10:01,409
We will.

1432
03:10:01,409 --> 03:10:02,290
We'll go all the way to the top.

1433
03:10:02,290 --> 03:10:03,129
Wait, wait.

1434
03:10:03,129 --> 03:10:03,969
Wait, what?

1435
03:10:04,090 --> 03:10:08,850
What are you?

1436
03:10:08,850 --> 03:10:09,889
Oh, what the fuck?

1437
03:10:09,889 --> 03:10:11,969
This is gonna be embarrassing.

1438
03:10:11,969 --> 03:10:17,379
Yes, I'm excited.

1439
03:10:17,379 --> 03:10:18,500
Hassan, freeze breath.

1440
03:10:18,500 --> 03:10:19,340
You have freeze breath.

1441
03:10:19,340 --> 03:10:20,500
It's really good.

1442
03:10:20,500 --> 03:10:21,420
I don't know how to do that.

1443
03:10:21,420 --> 03:10:22,260
How do I do that?

1444
03:10:22,260 --> 03:10:23,659
Standard triangle.

1445
03:10:36,409 --> 03:10:37,290
Oh shit.

1446
03:10:37,290 --> 03:10:40,360
The weekend is too powerful.

1447
03:10:40,360 --> 03:10:41,200
All right.

1448
03:10:45,879 --> 03:10:48,159
Oh, good movement, Ludd.

1449
03:10:48,159 --> 03:10:49,000
That was actually really good.

1450
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:52,059
What the hell?

1451
03:10:52,059 --> 03:10:54,739
Bro, you're using items in a one on one.

1452
03:10:54,739 --> 03:10:55,700
I'm in the lead.

1453
03:10:55,739 --> 03:10:57,059
You dead ass just picked up an item

1454
03:10:57,059 --> 03:10:57,899
and healed all your health.

1455
03:10:57,899 --> 03:10:59,739
Wait, am I not allowed to?

1456
03:10:59,739 --> 03:11:00,579
Wait, is that bad?

1457
03:11:00,579 --> 03:11:01,540
I actually don't know.

1458
03:11:01,540 --> 03:11:02,379
You've been using items?

1459
03:11:02,379 --> 03:11:03,219
No, I get it, I get it, bro.

1460
03:11:03,219 --> 03:11:04,059
I get it.

1461
03:11:04,059 --> 03:11:05,139
You dragon ass diss, come on.

1462
03:11:05,139 --> 03:11:05,979
Wait, what?

1463
03:11:05,979 --> 03:11:06,819
I'm sorry, you've been using items?

1464
03:11:06,819 --> 03:11:07,659
No, no, bro, I get it, bro.

1465
03:11:07,659 --> 03:11:14,959
Hey, I get it.

1466
03:11:14,959 --> 03:11:17,219
You've got him now, Ludd.

1467
03:11:17,219 --> 03:11:21,059
I just need to wait for an item to spawn.

1468
03:11:21,059 --> 03:11:23,260
I'm the most annoying guy in the movie theater.

1469
03:11:24,379 --> 03:11:25,579
Oh, that's you laughing?

1470
03:11:39,260 --> 03:11:40,100
Wait, what?

1471
03:11:40,100 --> 03:11:41,299
Dude, come on.

1472
03:11:41,299 --> 03:11:42,139
What?

1473
03:11:42,139 --> 03:11:44,020
Oh, I thought you got that kill.

1474
03:11:44,020 --> 03:11:48,459
I'm just being annoying.

1475
03:11:48,459 --> 03:11:50,020
You have a smoke screen, by the way, Ludd.

1476
03:11:50,020 --> 03:11:51,139
You might want to use it.

1477
03:11:51,139 --> 03:11:52,579
Oh.

1478
03:11:52,579 --> 03:11:53,420
What was that?

1479
03:11:53,420 --> 03:11:54,500
That's all right.

1480
03:11:54,500 --> 03:11:56,299
Maybe I should have brought my clip tonight.

1481
03:11:56,299 --> 03:11:59,889
I feel like I haven't done damage to you in an hour.

1482
03:11:59,889 --> 03:12:03,229
That smoke screen's good.

1483
03:12:03,229 --> 03:12:05,739
Nice.

1484
03:12:05,739 --> 03:12:06,579
Good up air.

1485
03:12:06,579 --> 03:12:10,260
Stop healing, you son of a bitch.

1486
03:12:10,260 --> 03:12:11,540
Good up air.

1487
03:12:11,540 --> 03:12:12,459
Watch out.

1488
03:12:12,459 --> 03:12:13,299
No!

1489
03:12:13,299 --> 03:12:14,139
Jesus Christ.

1490
03:12:14,139 --> 03:12:16,260
This is so fucking lame.

1491
03:12:16,260 --> 03:12:18,579
He's full healed like three times.

1492
03:12:18,579 --> 03:12:21,420
Yeah, he just keeps getting the giant med packs.

1493
03:12:22,860 --> 03:12:24,860
Oh no.

1494
03:12:24,860 --> 03:12:26,899
Should we keep going?

1495
03:12:26,899 --> 03:12:28,100
I mean, it's over now.

1496
03:12:32,649 --> 03:12:33,489
What was that for?

1497
03:12:33,489 --> 03:12:34,329
$5,000, right?

1498
03:12:34,329 --> 03:12:35,170
No Jigglypuff.

1499
03:12:35,170 --> 03:12:36,209
It's fine.

1500
03:12:36,209 --> 03:12:37,940
No Jigglypuff.

1501
03:12:37,940 --> 03:12:39,450
Disconnected.

1502
03:12:39,450 --> 03:12:40,370
I'm disconnected.

1503
03:12:40,370 --> 03:12:41,569
I'm going to get my fucking controller working

1504
03:12:41,569 --> 03:12:43,290
and I'm going to come back.

1505
03:12:43,290 --> 03:12:44,610
I'm not playing another second

1506
03:12:44,610 --> 03:12:46,610
with this cheating keyboard mouse.

1507
03:12:46,610 --> 03:12:48,010
Let's go!

1508
03:12:48,010 --> 03:12:48,850
That was a good fight.

1509
03:12:48,850 --> 03:12:50,969
That was a good run.

1510
03:12:50,969 --> 03:12:52,170
Hey, good game, man.

1511
03:12:52,170 --> 03:12:53,770
Is what I would say if you played a good game,

1512
03:12:53,770 --> 03:12:54,770
but you played a terrible game.

1513
03:12:55,610 --> 03:12:56,450
I'm sorry.

1514
03:12:56,450 --> 03:12:57,290
I must report.

1515
03:12:57,290 --> 03:12:58,129
You just sit there and all you do

1516
03:12:58,129 --> 03:13:00,530
is just accumulate the wealth of health packs.

1517
03:13:02,209 --> 03:13:04,620
Medicare for all, baby.

1518
03:13:04,620 --> 03:13:05,459
For one.

1519
03:13:05,459 --> 03:13:06,940
For one.

1520
03:13:06,940 --> 03:13:09,860
Yeah, well, I mean, you know,

1521
03:13:09,860 --> 03:13:11,940
if you need to use it, you should be able to use it

1522
03:13:11,940 --> 03:13:14,000
is my argument.

1523
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:14,840
All right, what are we doing?

1524
03:13:14,840 --> 03:13:15,719
Are we continuing?

1525
03:13:15,719 --> 03:13:16,559
Yeah, what's the plan?

1526
03:13:16,559 --> 03:13:17,680
You get that controller set up?

1527
03:13:17,680 --> 03:13:18,520
What's going on?

1528
03:13:18,520 --> 03:13:20,120
You guys, you do a free.

1529
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:20,959
Free for all?

1530
03:13:20,959 --> 03:13:21,799
That's a bad winner.

1531
03:13:21,799 --> 03:13:23,600
Okay, guys, I'm not a gamer.

1532
03:13:23,600 --> 03:13:26,440
Like, I'm not being serious either.

1533
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:29,200
Ludwig could fucking wipe the floor with me in every game.

1534
03:13:29,200 --> 03:13:30,040
Wait, hold on a second.

1535
03:13:30,040 --> 03:13:30,879
Except for this one.

1536
03:13:30,879 --> 03:13:33,319
Hassan, you beat Elden Ring, didn't you?

1537
03:13:33,319 --> 03:13:34,620
I did.

1538
03:13:34,620 --> 03:13:36,059
I was better than Lud on that too.

1539
03:13:36,059 --> 03:13:38,059
But you can't, you're a gamer.

1540
03:13:38,059 --> 03:13:39,860
If you can beat Elden Ring.

1541
03:13:39,860 --> 03:13:40,739
If you can beat Elden Ring,

1542
03:13:40,739 --> 03:13:47,860
I think you get the gamer card, I'd say.

1543
03:13:47,860 --> 03:13:52,500
This non-gamer beat me multiple times.

1544
03:13:54,899 --> 03:13:56,739
All right, I think we have to make a new party, right?

1545
03:13:56,739 --> 03:13:57,579
Yeah.

1546
03:13:57,579 --> 03:13:58,420
Yeah.

1547
03:13:58,420 --> 03:14:00,260
Who has everybody on a friend's list?

1548
03:14:00,260 --> 03:14:03,120
I think it's, is it you, Hassan?

1549
03:14:03,120 --> 03:14:05,780
I believe so.

1550
03:14:05,780 --> 03:14:07,260
We're all in the recently played though,

1551
03:14:07,260 --> 03:14:08,620
so you can just invite through there

1552
03:14:08,620 --> 03:14:09,780
if you wanna host again, German.

1553
03:14:09,780 --> 03:14:15,059
Or Hassan hosts, it doesn't matter.

1554
03:14:15,059 --> 03:14:17,530
I guess, like this?

1555
03:14:17,530 --> 03:14:19,329
Dude, when I alt-tab, it's so annoying.

1556
03:14:19,329 --> 03:14:21,530
It just like, is stuck.

1557
03:14:21,530 --> 03:14:24,459
How do I?

1558
03:14:24,459 --> 03:14:26,500
Doesn't say anybody else is online.

1559
03:14:26,500 --> 03:14:28,379
Go to tab, recently played with.

1560
03:14:28,379 --> 03:14:30,260
Up on the top right corner is his social.

1561
03:14:30,260 --> 03:14:31,540
Go to tab, recently played with.

1562
03:14:31,540 --> 03:14:32,899
It should come up as Commodore Pack.

1563
03:14:32,899 --> 03:14:34,299
Oh, there it is, okay.

1564
03:14:34,780 --> 03:14:38,809
Yeah.

1565
03:14:38,809 --> 03:14:42,370
Which Commodore Pack, I sent you a invite.

1566
03:14:42,370 --> 03:14:44,489
Wait, no, that's not, who's Commodore Pack?

1567
03:14:44,489 --> 03:14:47,530
Wait, oh shit, oh wait, I think that's, is that Lyric?

1568
03:14:47,530 --> 03:14:49,170
That might be Lyric, yeah.

1569
03:14:49,170 --> 03:14:51,090
I'm probably like, oops.

1570
03:14:51,930 --> 03:14:56,700
I'm not pressing win-tab chat, I'm not.

1571
03:14:56,700 --> 03:14:57,819
They're gonna be like, is this Germa?

1572
03:14:57,819 --> 03:15:08,319
Like, why is, Germa's like pinging me?

1573
03:15:08,319 --> 03:15:11,239
Are you guys getting those invites?

1574
03:15:11,239 --> 03:15:12,479
No, I haven't got it yet.

1575
03:15:12,479 --> 03:15:14,440
Mine's the big moist.

1576
03:15:14,440 --> 03:15:19,069
Yeah, I should, it says party invite.

1577
03:15:19,069 --> 03:15:21,540
I tried inviting everybody.

1578
03:15:21,540 --> 03:15:23,219
Am I like still in your party or something?

1579
03:15:23,219 --> 03:15:26,819
I'm not seeing it, and I'm also not able to,

1580
03:15:26,819 --> 03:15:33,139
I don't know how to do a, I don't know how to do a party.

1581
03:15:33,139 --> 03:15:36,059
Oh, okay, custom, okay, okay, create all my lobby.

1582
03:15:36,059 --> 03:15:37,700
Oh, you have to actually make a custom game first.

1583
03:15:37,700 --> 03:15:38,620
Yeah, yeah, I'm making it right now,

1584
03:15:38,620 --> 03:15:39,459
I'm making it right now.

1585
03:15:39,459 --> 03:15:42,389
Okay, hold up, hold up, hold up.

1586
03:15:42,389 --> 03:15:45,629
Wait, oh my God, my fucking keyboard is broken.

1587
03:15:45,629 --> 03:15:48,319
Wait, there's something wrong with my keyboard.

1588
03:15:48,319 --> 03:15:52,379
I press escape and the windows button works.

1589
03:15:52,379 --> 03:15:53,219
Like.

1590
03:15:53,219 --> 03:15:55,879
Dude, you need to get a whole new computer.

1591
03:15:55,920 --> 03:15:57,440
Wait, what the fuck?

1592
03:15:57,440 --> 03:16:02,250
That is weird, hold up.

1593
03:16:02,250 --> 03:16:04,370
Yeah, dude, I think your graphics card, your hard drive,

1594
03:16:04,370 --> 03:16:05,569
your memory, it's all gone.

1595
03:16:05,569 --> 03:16:08,090
I'm not kidding, I'm like literally pressing escape.

1596
03:16:08,090 --> 03:16:10,930
That's why it was locking whenever I alt tab.

1597
03:16:10,930 --> 03:16:13,129
When I press escape, the windows,

1598
03:16:13,129 --> 03:16:17,260
it triggers the windows key for no reason.

1599
03:16:17,260 --> 03:16:18,979
Really, that's weird.

1600
03:16:18,979 --> 03:16:22,069
Yeah, my control is not even on right now,

1601
03:16:22,069 --> 03:16:26,620
but it thinks it's like, no, my control is not stuck.

1602
03:16:26,620 --> 03:16:31,540
Maybe just restart the game.

1603
03:16:31,540 --> 03:16:34,020
Yeah, it might just be like memory leak or something,

1604
03:16:34,020 --> 03:16:35,180
I couldn't tell you.

1605
03:16:35,180 --> 03:16:39,790
Just try reloading.

1606
03:16:39,790 --> 03:16:40,829
Oh, okay, it's working.

1607
03:16:40,829 --> 03:16:44,229
I just like, I unplugged it and I slammed it a bunch of times

1608
03:16:44,229 --> 03:16:45,190
and it's working now.

1609
03:16:45,190 --> 03:16:52,020
I'm going to the lab, I wanna check out something.

1610
03:16:52,020 --> 03:16:54,760
Yeah, I mean, Velma, seriously,

1611
03:16:54,760 --> 03:16:58,760
Velma's standard attack is a projectile and it's awesome.

1612
03:16:58,760 --> 03:17:00,000
No, your Velma was nasty.

1613
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:01,680
Scarlet Otter is you, right?

1614
03:17:01,680 --> 03:17:03,780
Yeah.

1615
03:17:03,780 --> 03:17:07,280
Okay, big moist, added, invited player.

1616
03:17:08,909 --> 03:17:12,209
The only person I don't have is Ludd

1617
03:17:12,209 --> 03:17:18,340
and I think I added him, but Ludd,

1618
03:17:19,139 --> 03:17:20,860
is he there?

1619
03:17:20,860 --> 03:17:24,260
He's furiously going through cabinets

1620
03:17:24,260 --> 03:17:27,659
to try to find a way to plug a controller in, I think.

1621
03:17:27,659 --> 03:17:28,659
Isn't he sitting it out?

1622
03:17:28,659 --> 03:17:33,450
He said, you guys, did I beat his ass so mercilessly

1623
03:17:33,450 --> 03:17:34,690
that he had to fucking rage quit?

1624
03:17:34,690 --> 03:17:36,450
That's crazy, that's so sad.

1625
03:17:36,450 --> 03:17:38,209
You actually just spanked him so hard

1626
03:17:38,209 --> 03:17:40,010
that he's now spending like 20 minutes

1627
03:17:40,010 --> 03:17:41,489
to getting a controller to work.

1628
03:17:41,489 --> 03:17:44,090
That's wild, that's a wild state of affairs, man.

1629
03:17:44,090 --> 03:17:51,340
You hate to see it.

1630
03:17:51,340 --> 03:17:53,629
We're not even in the title, Jerma.

1631
03:17:53,629 --> 03:17:55,350
It just says big stream for Top G's only,

1632
03:17:55,350 --> 03:17:59,040
multi-versus with big man, Penguinzo.

1633
03:17:59,040 --> 03:17:59,879
Who?

1634
03:17:59,879 --> 03:18:00,719
You see that?

1635
03:18:00,719 --> 03:18:02,260
What, my stream title?

1636
03:18:02,260 --> 03:18:03,899
No, I'm saying Ludd's stream title.

1637
03:18:03,899 --> 03:18:05,819
Oh, Ludd's stream title.

1638
03:18:05,819 --> 03:18:08,350
No one's in my stream title.

1639
03:18:08,350 --> 03:18:09,870
My stream title is dog shit.

1640
03:18:09,870 --> 03:18:11,909
I freaked out because I moved to the sponsor segment

1641
03:18:11,909 --> 03:18:12,950
and I was like, I don't know what to title this.

1642
03:18:12,950 --> 03:18:15,190
So I was like, let's go bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.

1643
03:18:15,190 --> 03:18:18,899
I don't know.

1644
03:18:18,899 --> 03:18:20,100
You don't do a lot of sponsorships, do you?

1645
03:18:20,100 --> 03:18:22,579
Like gaming sponsorships?

1646
03:18:22,579 --> 03:18:26,860
I mean, recently I have been.

1647
03:18:26,860 --> 03:18:31,889
Kind of a new thing.

1648
03:18:31,889 --> 03:18:33,870
It just says bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.

1649
03:18:33,870 --> 03:18:34,709
It says add the title.

1650
03:18:34,709 --> 03:18:37,850
Ludd is working with his tech for the control.

1651
03:18:37,850 --> 03:18:40,170
This is why Ludd doesn't hang out with you.

1652
03:18:40,170 --> 03:18:41,010
Okay.

1653
03:18:41,010 --> 03:18:43,129
That's kind of fucked up.

1654
03:18:43,129 --> 03:18:44,530
That is fucked up.

1655
03:18:44,530 --> 03:18:46,770
And the real reason is because,

1656
03:18:46,770 --> 03:18:49,399
wait, hazards enabled by the way or no?

1657
03:18:49,399 --> 03:18:50,719
No, and then I turn those off

1658
03:18:50,719 --> 03:18:54,540
if we're going to be doing some FFA.

1659
03:18:54,540 --> 03:18:56,700
Actually, just let it be wacky.

1660
03:18:56,700 --> 03:18:58,139
You can do some hazards.

1661
03:18:58,139 --> 03:18:58,979
Let it ride, fuck it.

1662
03:18:58,979 --> 03:18:59,819
It'll be wacky.

1663
03:18:59,819 --> 03:19:03,940
Free for all time, two and a half minutes.

1664
03:19:03,940 --> 03:19:05,139
Yeah, it says bugs that many times

1665
03:19:05,139 --> 03:19:11,860
because I'm a bugs main.

1666
03:19:11,860 --> 03:19:13,540
I'm going to take this moment to use the restroom.

1667
03:19:13,540 --> 03:19:14,739
I'll be right back, boys.

1668
03:19:14,739 --> 03:19:15,579
Actually, you know what?

1669
03:19:15,579 --> 03:19:17,299
That's probably a good idea.

1670
03:19:17,299 --> 03:19:19,209
Are you looking for a time to go pee, Hassan?

1671
03:19:19,209 --> 03:19:20,049
I already did.

1672
03:19:20,049 --> 03:19:20,889
Oh, okay.

1673
03:19:20,889 --> 03:19:21,879
I'm so quick with it.

1674
03:19:21,879 --> 03:19:23,610
I do gamer pees.

1675
03:19:23,610 --> 03:19:25,850
Dude, I'm such an old man.

1676
03:19:25,850 --> 03:19:29,549
It takes me like two minutes at least to pee.

1677
03:19:29,549 --> 03:19:31,229
My community times my pisses,

1678
03:19:31,229 --> 03:19:36,940
so mine is like around a minute and 12, I think.

1679
03:19:36,940 --> 03:19:38,360
One 12.

1680
03:19:38,360 --> 03:19:39,700
Yeah, I am.

1681
03:19:39,700 --> 03:19:41,659
It's a little bit faster than my 500

1682
03:19:41,659 --> 03:19:47,700
on the rowing machine.

1683
03:19:47,700 --> 03:19:48,579
Rowing machine?

1684
03:19:48,579 --> 03:19:50,430
All right.

1685
03:19:50,430 --> 03:19:51,709
Jeremy, you work out, right?

1686
03:19:51,709 --> 03:19:52,750
Right, go piss, go piss.

1687
03:19:52,750 --> 03:19:53,590
I used to.

1688
03:19:53,590 --> 03:19:54,790
All right, I'm not going to mute.

1689
03:19:55,549 --> 03:19:57,110
I'm not going to mute this call,

1690
03:19:57,110 --> 03:19:59,149
so make sure you behave, please.

1691
03:19:59,149 --> 03:19:59,989
Sponsor stream.

1692
03:19:59,989 --> 03:20:03,540
Okay, I'm going to say so many gamer words right now.

1693
03:20:03,540 --> 03:20:08,399
You dare.

1694
03:20:08,399 --> 03:20:10,360
79 seconds last time, good looks champ.

1695
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:11,200
You got it.

1696
03:20:11,200 --> 03:20:14,059
Oh, by the way, chat,

1697
03:20:14,059 --> 03:20:18,260
I completely nailed it on the Tucker Carlson thing

1698
03:20:18,260 --> 03:20:23,700
that I said he was going to say.

1699
03:20:23,700 --> 03:20:25,579
Apparently his segment came out

1700
03:20:25,579 --> 03:20:29,680
and it's identical to what I said he was going to say.

1701
03:20:29,680 --> 03:20:37,989
Yeah.

1702
03:20:37,989 --> 03:20:40,930
Even with the Sandy Cortez lock, that's crazy.

1703
03:20:40,930 --> 03:22:09,700
Oh wait, I should mute myself.

1704
03:22:41,579 --> 03:22:42,620
All right, I'm back.

1705
03:22:47,309 --> 03:22:48,270
How's everybody doing?

1706
03:22:48,270 --> 03:22:56,149
Everybody just chilling?

1707
03:22:56,149 --> 03:23:02,340
We good?

1708
03:23:02,340 --> 03:23:04,500
No, but seriously, honestly, seriously,

1709
03:23:04,500 --> 03:23:07,250
let me just say the same thing three times.

1710
03:23:07,250 --> 03:23:08,209
Warner Brothers Interactive,

1711
03:23:08,209 --> 03:23:11,510
thanks for sponsoring the stream.

1712
03:23:11,510 --> 03:23:13,069
The ad segment, I guess, is kind of over,

1713
03:23:13,069 --> 03:23:14,510
but we're still playing.

1714
03:23:14,510 --> 03:23:16,430
This is really fun, really cool opportunity.

1715
03:23:16,430 --> 03:23:18,940
I'm really happy to play it.

1716
03:23:18,940 --> 03:23:23,559
The game is great.

1717
03:23:23,559 --> 03:23:26,520
Again, I'll say it one more time.

1718
03:23:26,520 --> 03:23:30,920
It's free to play.

1719
03:23:30,920 --> 03:23:34,010
It's got tons of cool characters.

1720
03:23:34,010 --> 03:23:37,190
If you're watching and you have drops enabled,

1721
03:23:37,190 --> 03:23:40,100
it's kind of this early access period.

1722
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:43,790
July 26th, it goes into open beta,

1723
03:23:43,790 --> 03:23:47,739
actually open open beta and get it on anything.

1724
03:23:47,739 --> 03:23:50,739
PlayStation, Xbox, PC, full cross compatibility,

1725
03:23:50,739 --> 03:23:54,370
cross progression.

1726
03:23:54,370 --> 03:23:56,010
You can play wherever.

1727
03:24:02,200 --> 03:24:03,239
People are going to think I'm a weirdo

1728
03:24:03,239 --> 03:24:06,319
when this comes over here.

1729
03:24:06,319 --> 03:24:08,520
I mean, it's kind of weird what I'm doing, but whatever.

1730
03:24:08,520 --> 03:24:19,579
I didn't have any clean cups.

1731
03:24:19,579 --> 03:24:23,549
Wait, what does Hassan do?

1732
03:24:23,549 --> 03:24:26,069
Hey, you were, what, you here?

1733
03:24:26,069 --> 03:24:27,299
How are we doing?

1734
03:24:27,299 --> 03:24:28,860
I'm here.

1735
03:24:28,860 --> 03:24:31,340
I'm just doing a little bit of politics,

1736
03:24:34,200 --> 03:24:35,600
having some fun.

1737
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:37,000
I muted myself, don't worry.

1738
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:40,000
I did not radicalize the Germaniacs.

1739
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:41,200
Excuse me.

1740
03:24:42,959 --> 03:24:44,920
They're not the Germaniacs.

1741
03:24:44,920 --> 03:24:46,719
Fuck, what were they, the germaphobes?

1742
03:24:46,719 --> 03:24:48,440
The germamites.

1743
03:24:48,440 --> 03:24:53,299
The germamites, damn it, okay.

1744
03:24:53,299 --> 03:24:56,430
Now, do you think, I think Ludwig is probably

1745
03:24:56,430 --> 03:25:12,930
putting holes in his drywall, looking for a chord.

1746
03:25:12,930 --> 03:25:14,090
Okay, that looks good.

1747
03:25:16,860 --> 03:25:19,350
Hello.

1748
03:25:19,709 --> 03:25:22,350
I mean, it's kind of weird what I'm doing, but whatever.

1749
03:25:22,350 --> 03:25:24,309
Jeremy, you want to, you want to one we've honored,

1750
03:25:24,309 --> 03:25:25,309
one v one?

1751
03:25:25,309 --> 03:25:26,149
I don't know, you know what I'm saying?

1752
03:25:26,149 --> 03:25:26,989
We can one v one.

1753
03:25:26,989 --> 03:25:27,829
While we wait.

1754
03:25:27,829 --> 03:25:31,059
You want to just invite me?

1755
03:25:31,059 --> 03:25:36,299
Yeah.

1756
03:25:36,299 --> 03:25:37,979
I'm drinking it out of the pitcher.

1757
03:25:37,979 --> 03:25:40,180
Let me finish this fire tweet.

1758
03:25:40,180 --> 03:25:41,899
You got a good tweet?

1759
03:25:41,899 --> 03:25:46,829
Well, I just, you watch Tucker Carlson?

1760
03:25:46,829 --> 03:25:48,989
Are you familiar with his rhetoric?

1761
03:25:48,989 --> 03:25:51,270
I'm familiar with the man, Tucker Carlson.

1762
03:25:51,270 --> 03:25:52,430
Yeah.

1763
03:25:52,430 --> 03:25:54,590
Well, earlier today, someone in the chat asked me

1764
03:25:54,590 --> 03:25:55,829
what Tucker Carlson is going to say

1765
03:25:55,829 --> 03:25:58,829
about AOC getting arrested at Capitol Hill

1766
03:25:58,829 --> 03:26:01,510
for protesting outside of the Supreme Court

1767
03:26:01,510 --> 03:26:03,030
or the United States.

1768
03:26:03,030 --> 03:26:08,209
And I basically nailed, I mean, nailed his exact speech.

1769
03:26:08,979 --> 03:26:09,819
Word for word?

1770
03:26:09,819 --> 03:26:11,780
With like one minor exception, not word for word,

1771
03:26:11,780 --> 03:26:14,219
but down to like the psychotic joker laugh

1772
03:26:14,219 --> 03:26:16,309
that he was going to do.

1773
03:26:16,309 --> 03:26:18,670
There was a joker laugh involved?

1774
03:26:18,670 --> 03:26:19,590
Yeah.

1775
03:26:19,590 --> 03:26:27,770
He likes to do joker laughs.

1776
03:26:27,770 --> 03:26:30,010
You want to, let's one v one.

1777
03:26:30,010 --> 03:26:34,020
Okay, let's do it.

1778
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:35,780
I need an invite.

1779
03:26:35,780 --> 03:26:38,680
Hold on.

1780
03:26:38,680 --> 03:26:41,920
Okay, let's do another lobby, custom lobby.

1781
03:26:41,920 --> 03:26:46,100
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1782
03:26:46,100 --> 03:26:47,739
I got a picture of ice cold water.

1783
03:26:57,020 --> 03:26:58,700
No, I don't want to drink it on camera

1784
03:26:58,700 --> 03:27:00,420
because it's like really bright glass

1785
03:27:00,420 --> 03:27:01,780
and it's going to like reflect off the screen

1786
03:27:01,780 --> 03:27:03,579
and show my dick.

1787
03:27:03,579 --> 03:27:15,450
I just invited you.

1788
03:27:15,450 --> 03:27:19,129
Dude, I just said something so crazy that the chat froze

1789
03:27:19,129 --> 03:27:22,450
because people just spammed question marks.

1790
03:27:22,450 --> 03:27:23,690
What did you say?

1791
03:27:23,690 --> 03:27:24,530
I talked about it like that.

1792
03:27:24,530 --> 03:27:25,370
Oh, your dick?

1793
03:27:25,370 --> 03:27:28,860
I just said the word dick and everybody freaked out.

1794
03:27:29,379 --> 03:27:30,340
The chat actually broke.

1795
03:27:30,340 --> 03:27:31,979
It stopped functioning for like three or four

1796
03:27:31,979 --> 03:27:33,989
straight seconds.

1797
03:27:33,989 --> 03:27:37,770
It happens, dude.

1798
03:27:37,770 --> 03:27:40,729
Okay, we're, we're doing, should we do two v two

1799
03:27:40,729 --> 03:27:43,739
against people or should we do a one v one?

1800
03:27:43,739 --> 03:27:46,520
Oh wait, he's back.

1801
03:27:46,520 --> 03:27:48,540
Where's Charlie?

1802
03:27:48,540 --> 03:27:50,100
I think he's hanging out.

1803
03:27:50,100 --> 03:27:50,940
Yeah, I'm here.

1804
03:27:50,940 --> 03:27:51,899
I'm ready.

1805
03:27:51,899 --> 03:27:57,670
Okay, everything works with one weird exception.

1806
03:27:57,670 --> 03:27:59,270
Jeremy, you got to leave again, I think.

1807
03:27:59,270 --> 03:28:00,110
Oh, okay.

1808
03:28:00,110 --> 03:28:02,219
So that I can, so I can,

1809
03:28:02,219 --> 03:28:04,459
cause I don't know how to put you back in the,

1810
03:28:04,459 --> 03:28:05,540
in my lobby.

1811
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:07,219
Oh wait, I'll just remove you.

1812
03:28:07,219 --> 03:28:08,739
I can leave.

1813
03:28:08,739 --> 03:28:09,780
Wait, wait, here, hold on.

1814
03:28:09,780 --> 03:28:17,700
And I'm going to add you again.

1815
03:28:17,700 --> 03:28:19,620
Oh, if me and Ludd are going to do one v one

1816
03:28:19,620 --> 03:28:21,020
in free for all, and you guys are going to watch,

1817
03:28:21,020 --> 03:28:23,180
it doesn't really matter what team you're in, right?

1818
03:28:23,180 --> 03:28:24,260
No.

1819
03:28:24,260 --> 03:28:25,940
Did you get a controller?

1820
03:28:25,940 --> 03:28:26,780
Yeah, we're not going to do two v two.

1821
03:28:26,780 --> 03:28:27,739
I got a controller.

1822
03:28:27,739 --> 03:28:28,700
Oh hell yeah.

1823
03:28:28,700 --> 03:28:31,860
Only weird thing is it has a insane amount of lag,

1824
03:28:31,860 --> 03:28:33,540
but you know, I'm sure that's fine.

1825
03:28:33,540 --> 03:28:35,219
What kind of controller is it?

1826
03:28:35,219 --> 03:28:37,809
Xbox.

1827
03:28:37,809 --> 03:28:40,620
Xbox one, Xbox 360.

1828
03:28:40,620 --> 03:28:42,899
Ludd, you have to, you have to accept my friend request

1829
03:28:42,899 --> 03:28:46,739
on your, on your Warner Brothers like account or whatever.

1830
03:28:46,739 --> 03:28:47,579
I refuse.

1831
03:28:47,579 --> 03:28:51,799
And moist, I added you as well.

1832
03:28:51,799 --> 03:28:59,500
I'll be there in just one sec.

1833
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:24,780
Oh here, I just added, I just sent you an invite.

1834
03:29:24,780 --> 03:29:25,620
Put down the picture.

1835
03:29:25,620 --> 03:29:29,309
I almost saw it monkey, whatever.

1836
03:29:29,309 --> 03:29:31,110
Can you imagine like a reflection off the screen,

1837
03:29:31,110 --> 03:29:34,620
off this and like, just me naked.

1838
03:29:34,620 --> 03:29:35,899
Are you?

1839
03:29:35,899 --> 03:29:37,420
No.

1840
03:29:37,420 --> 03:29:39,860
Hassan, you friended me, smiley face?

1841
03:29:39,860 --> 03:29:41,379
I did.

1842
03:29:41,379 --> 03:29:44,260
The only time where we actually, you know,

1843
03:29:44,260 --> 03:29:45,340
you should be in your friend advice,

1844
03:29:45,340 --> 03:29:50,709
but you probably have a lot right now.

1845
03:29:50,709 --> 03:29:54,030
But I also sent you an invite to the game.

1846
03:29:54,030 --> 03:29:58,440
How do I scroll through?

1847
03:29:58,440 --> 03:30:02,579
This is the only time where we're friends.

1848
03:30:02,579 --> 03:30:06,729
I like the mystery machine profile picture Ludwig.

1849
03:30:06,729 --> 03:30:10,010
Yeah, that's, it's cause I love Scooby, but also do.

1850
03:30:14,850 --> 03:30:17,809
What's new Scooby Doo coming after you?

1851
03:30:17,809 --> 03:30:22,180
Gonna find that mystery.

1852
03:30:22,180 --> 03:30:26,030
What's new Scooby Doo?

1853
03:30:26,030 --> 03:30:29,979
Isn't it Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?

1854
03:30:29,979 --> 03:30:32,020
I'm referring to the other, the newer one.

1855
03:30:32,860 --> 03:30:36,379
We got some, I never was a big Scooby Doo fan.

1856
03:30:36,379 --> 03:30:37,620
Are we waiting on big man?

1857
03:30:37,620 --> 03:30:39,680
Yeah.

1858
03:30:39,680 --> 03:30:40,520
I always thought that Scooby Doo

1859
03:30:40,520 --> 03:30:43,340
would be a great serial character.

1860
03:30:43,340 --> 03:30:46,870
Why are my fucking things showing?

1861
03:30:46,870 --> 03:30:49,549
I already, I thought I shut it off.

1862
03:30:49,549 --> 03:30:51,829
Scooby Snacks would just be a great serial.

1863
03:30:51,829 --> 03:30:52,670
They should have just made Scooby Snacks

1864
03:30:52,670 --> 03:30:53,829
and they would do two commercials.

1865
03:30:53,829 --> 03:30:55,149
He would be the coolest one out of all of them.

1866
03:30:55,149 --> 03:31:01,250
He would kick the shit out of Tony the Tiger.

1867
03:31:01,250 --> 03:31:02,489
Scooby Snack cereal?

1868
03:31:02,489 --> 03:31:04,049
People are saying they already did that.

1869
03:31:04,049 --> 03:31:06,569
There are multiple Scooby universes.

1870
03:31:06,569 --> 03:31:08,010
Yeah, but it was a limited time probably thing.

1871
03:31:08,450 --> 03:31:14,899
It's not like Tony the Tiger presents Frosted Flakes.

1872
03:31:14,899 --> 03:31:17,260
Yeah, I don't know why I'm getting party invites nonstop.

1873
03:31:17,260 --> 03:31:19,540
I thought I ended the.

1874
03:31:19,540 --> 03:31:21,379
If you go into your settings, the left side.

1875
03:31:21,379 --> 03:31:22,219
I did.

1876
03:31:22,219 --> 03:31:23,239
Oh, you did?

1877
03:31:23,239 --> 03:31:24,120
I did that already.

1878
03:31:24,120 --> 03:31:25,600
Yeah, party invites from friends only.

1879
03:31:25,600 --> 03:31:28,379
Oh, okay, I should do that.

1880
03:31:28,379 --> 03:31:33,549
Show friend invite notifications, I turned off.

1881
03:31:33,549 --> 03:31:35,389
I guess party invites from friends only.

1882
03:31:35,389 --> 03:31:37,559
I'm ready.

1883
03:31:37,559 --> 03:31:42,780
All right, I invited you again.

1884
03:31:42,780 --> 03:31:48,600
They have Scooby Snack cookies?

1885
03:31:48,600 --> 03:31:50,700
That's probably, why do I feel like

1886
03:31:50,979 --> 03:31:54,739
you're making this up and I'm gonna go buy dog biscuits?

1887
03:31:54,739 --> 03:31:55,940
This is not right.

1888
03:31:55,940 --> 03:31:57,260
Well, I mean, if they're dog biscuits,

1889
03:31:57,260 --> 03:31:58,219
doesn't that make it real?

1890
03:31:58,219 --> 03:32:00,020
Actually, Scooby-Doo eats a lot of human food,

1891
03:32:00,020 --> 03:32:01,860
which is bad, it's not good.

1892
03:32:03,299 --> 03:32:04,739
It's like a bunch of scubs and shit

1893
03:32:04,739 --> 03:32:06,579
with like garlic and onions on it.

1894
03:32:06,579 --> 03:32:07,739
Your dog will start baking.

1895
03:32:07,739 --> 03:32:08,579
That's right.

1896
03:32:08,579 --> 03:32:10,739
I heard you weren't a cat person until recently

1897
03:32:10,739 --> 03:32:12,899
and now you have toxoplasmosis.

1898
03:32:12,899 --> 03:32:14,420
That's fucked up.

1899
03:32:14,420 --> 03:32:15,260
Is that true?

1900
03:32:15,260 --> 03:32:16,260
What?

1901
03:32:16,260 --> 03:32:18,860
Well, I don't have toxoplasmosis,

1902
03:32:18,860 --> 03:32:22,510
but I have become more of a cat person.

1903
03:32:22,510 --> 03:32:23,989
Interesting.

1904
03:32:23,989 --> 03:32:24,829
Okay.

1905
03:32:24,829 --> 03:32:27,309
Where's the toxoplasmosis thing coming from?

1906
03:32:29,819 --> 03:32:32,629
Toxoplasmosis is when you like,

1907
03:32:32,629 --> 03:32:35,590
it's just like cat poop makes you love your cat

1908
03:32:35,590 --> 03:32:38,030
and become like servile to your cat.

1909
03:32:38,030 --> 03:32:39,829
Yeah, like brainwashed.

1910
03:32:39,829 --> 03:32:45,170
I thought it was nothing that makes you take more risks.

1911
03:32:45,170 --> 03:32:46,649
I don't know about that.

1912
03:32:46,649 --> 03:32:48,409
I don't have it is something that someone

1913
03:32:48,409 --> 03:32:55,090
with toxoplasmosis would say though, for sure.

1914
03:32:55,090 --> 03:32:55,930
Anyway.

1915
03:32:58,159 --> 03:32:59,000
I don't know.

1916
03:32:59,000 --> 03:33:01,200
We'll see if the new game Stray that came out,

1917
03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:03,559
if that'll make me love cats.

1918
03:33:03,559 --> 03:33:04,799
Everybody's playing that.

1919
03:33:04,799 --> 03:33:05,639
Is it cool?

1920
03:33:05,639 --> 03:33:08,030
It looks pretty cool.

1921
03:33:08,030 --> 03:33:08,989
A cat simulator game.

1922
03:33:08,989 --> 03:33:09,829
It looks cool.

1923
03:33:09,829 --> 03:33:11,690
Are you not a cat person, Asan?

1924
03:33:11,690 --> 03:33:14,329
I mean, I'm not like a huge cat person.

1925
03:33:14,329 --> 03:33:15,370
I like kittens,

1926
03:33:15,370 --> 03:33:17,889
but I do think that cats are too like hot and cold for me.

1927
03:33:17,889 --> 03:33:18,729
You know what I mean?

1928
03:33:18,729 --> 03:33:20,569
I like the companion,

1929
03:33:20,569 --> 03:33:23,770
like the lifelong companionship of a dog more than...

1930
03:33:23,770 --> 03:33:26,739
Superpowers Batman.

1931
03:33:26,739 --> 03:33:29,579
So are we doing a just free brawl?

1932
03:33:29,579 --> 03:33:30,420
Oh my God.

1933
03:33:30,420 --> 03:33:31,260
I don't know.

1934
03:33:31,260 --> 03:33:32,100
Is it a 1v1?

1935
03:33:32,100 --> 03:33:32,940
Was it 1v1?

1936
03:33:32,940 --> 03:33:34,639
All right.

1937
03:33:34,639 --> 03:33:35,479
Okay.

1938
03:33:35,479 --> 03:33:53,250
Well, get me away from that edge.

1939
03:33:53,250 --> 03:33:56,420
Shit.

1940
03:33:56,420 --> 03:33:58,750
Oh God.

1941
03:33:58,750 --> 03:34:00,069
How did you even die?

1942
03:34:00,069 --> 03:34:03,149
There was no, nobody attacked you.

1943
03:34:03,149 --> 03:34:05,950
My control is on Bluetooth and has three second latency.

1944
03:34:05,950 --> 03:34:07,270
You're on a Bluetooth?

1945
03:34:08,809 --> 03:34:10,209
Jerm, it's been a rough day for me.

1946
03:34:10,209 --> 03:34:11,530
Oh my goodness.

1947
03:34:11,530 --> 03:34:12,889
Yeah, dude, imagine getting owned by me.

1948
03:34:12,889 --> 03:34:14,370
That's fucking really rough, dude.

1949
03:34:14,370 --> 03:34:15,209
All right.

1950
03:34:15,209 --> 03:34:16,690
Come on, man.

1951
03:34:16,690 --> 03:34:18,010
You survived.

1952
03:34:18,010 --> 03:34:19,250
I don't know how.

1953
03:34:19,250 --> 03:34:34,079
Blocking in this game?

1954
03:34:34,079 --> 03:34:34,920
Just dodging.

1955
03:34:34,920 --> 03:34:35,920
So perfect dodge.

1956
03:34:38,829 --> 03:34:40,069
Oh.

1957
03:34:40,069 --> 03:34:42,190
Oh, can I get the follow up?

1958
03:34:42,190 --> 03:34:43,590
Can I get the follow up?

1959
03:34:43,590 --> 03:34:48,510
Can I get the follow up?

1960
03:34:48,510 --> 03:34:49,770
Shit.

1961
03:34:49,770 --> 03:34:50,610
I needed that.

1962
03:34:50,610 --> 03:34:51,430
I needed that bad.

1963
03:34:51,430 --> 03:34:56,659
I needed that so bad.

1964
03:34:56,659 --> 03:34:57,500
Oh, I'm dead.

1965
03:34:57,500 --> 03:34:58,340
I'm so dead.

1966
03:34:58,340 --> 03:34:59,819
Oh, slide with the edgeguard.

1967
03:34:59,819 --> 03:35:01,569
I can't.

1968
03:35:01,569 --> 03:35:02,969
Oh, I couldn't get back.

1969
03:35:07,930 --> 03:35:08,770
Oh.

1970
03:35:08,770 --> 03:35:09,610
Well done.

1971
03:35:09,610 --> 03:35:10,819
Well done.

1972
03:35:10,819 --> 03:35:11,659
Wait, was that me?

1973
03:35:11,659 --> 03:35:12,479
Did you ring out?

1974
03:35:12,479 --> 03:35:13,319
Okay.

1975
03:35:23,750 --> 03:35:26,469
I'm having a rough game right now, boys.

1976
03:35:28,829 --> 03:35:29,670
What do you mean?

1977
03:35:29,670 --> 03:35:30,489
Aren't you?

1978
03:35:30,489 --> 03:35:31,350
Oh no, it's actually, oh shit.

1979
03:35:31,350 --> 03:35:32,389
Jerm was killing it.

1980
03:35:32,389 --> 03:35:34,309
Yeah, Jerm was going nuts.

1981
03:35:34,309 --> 03:35:35,469
I drank a pitcher of water.

1982
03:35:35,469 --> 03:35:36,309
I'm bad.

1983
03:35:36,309 --> 03:35:37,129
Wait, that double ring out was you?

1984
03:35:37,129 --> 03:35:38,149
I thought that was me.

1985
03:35:49,530 --> 03:35:54,959
Oh.

1986
03:35:57,600 --> 03:35:58,719
Oh, did I take it at the end?

1987
03:35:58,719 --> 03:35:59,639
Oh no.

1988
03:35:59,639 --> 03:36:00,920
That was close.

1989
03:36:00,920 --> 03:36:02,600
Yeah, it was close.

1990
03:36:03,399 --> 03:36:07,489
Where's my, where's my, oh.

1991
03:36:07,489 --> 03:36:08,329
GG, GG.

1992
03:36:08,329 --> 03:36:09,170
Good shit, Jerma.

1993
03:36:09,170 --> 03:36:09,989
Congratulations.

1994
03:36:09,989 --> 03:36:10,829
Good work.

1995
03:36:10,829 --> 03:36:12,610
It's the first free-for-all I think I've won today.

1996
03:36:12,610 --> 03:36:14,569
You know, congratulations on kill stealing

1997
03:36:14,569 --> 03:36:15,409
the entire game.

1998
03:36:15,409 --> 03:36:16,229
It's fine.

1999
03:36:16,229 --> 03:36:17,069
I mean, not a big deal.

2000
03:36:17,069 --> 03:36:17,909
Top damage.

2001
03:36:19,889 --> 03:36:20,850
Whatever.

2002
03:36:20,850 --> 03:36:25,569
Ludwig, you good?

2003
03:36:25,569 --> 03:36:29,969
Are you there?

2004
03:36:29,969 --> 03:36:32,809
I think steam is coming out of his ears.

2005
03:36:32,809 --> 03:36:33,649
Are you there, dude?

2006
03:36:33,649 --> 03:36:34,469
Are you okay?

2007
03:36:38,950 --> 03:36:40,790
Stop talking to me, man.

2008
03:36:40,790 --> 03:36:43,190
So you guys want to do your 1v1

2009
03:36:44,069 --> 03:36:44,909
or do you want to keep doing free-for-all?

2010
03:36:44,909 --> 03:36:45,750
What do you guys want to do?

2011
03:36:45,750 --> 03:36:46,950
Are you, are you okay with doing a 1v1

2012
03:36:46,950 --> 03:36:50,239
or what's happening?

2013
03:36:50,239 --> 03:36:53,120
He's looking at his controller furiously.

2014
03:36:53,120 --> 03:36:56,030
I just found a new one.

2015
03:36:56,030 --> 03:36:57,030
Okay.

2016
03:36:57,030 --> 03:36:59,500
Let's shoot out a free-for-all.

2017
03:37:03,180 --> 03:37:05,379
Do you get banned from like all the Smash tournaments

2018
03:37:05,379 --> 03:37:08,020
going forward if you get owned so mercilessly

2019
03:37:08,020 --> 03:37:12,190
by like someone as bad as me?

2020
03:37:12,190 --> 03:37:16,790
Like, how does that work?

2021
03:37:16,790 --> 03:37:17,750
Damn, Lud is just hitting you

2022
03:37:17,750 --> 03:37:19,629
with a cold shoulder real hard right now.

2023
03:37:19,629 --> 03:37:21,129
I think he's going to punch you.

2024
03:37:21,129 --> 03:37:21,969
Yeah.

2025
03:37:21,969 --> 03:37:22,809
This sounds like it's about to be

2026
03:37:22,809 --> 03:37:23,909
like a schoolyard fight here.

2027
03:37:25,149 --> 03:37:30,579
Oh no.

2028
03:37:30,579 --> 03:37:32,379
Oh, that's, that was definitely a bunch of batteries

2029
03:37:32,379 --> 03:37:33,219
that just fell.

2030
03:37:33,219 --> 03:37:34,059
This is bullying and bannable.

2031
03:37:34,059 --> 03:37:34,899
Dude, I'm just taking out,

2032
03:37:34,899 --> 03:37:36,540
I'm just taking out all my frustrations

2033
03:37:36,540 --> 03:37:38,860
because I asked Lud to come with me to the UK

2034
03:37:38,860 --> 03:37:41,260
and potentially Amsterdam.

2035
03:37:41,260 --> 03:37:44,500
And he was just like, yeah, just ask Cutie.

2036
03:37:44,500 --> 03:37:46,059
Wait, he left the lobby again?

2037
03:37:46,059 --> 03:37:47,500
Dude, it sounded like he was rolling dice

2038
03:37:47,500 --> 03:37:48,600
for damage to you.

2039
03:37:54,200 --> 03:37:58,739
Oh no.

2040
03:37:58,739 --> 03:38:00,379
Demand and everything everywhere all at once.

2041
03:38:00,379 --> 03:38:01,620
Moist meter from Charlie.

2042
03:38:01,620 --> 03:38:03,659
Why?

2043
03:38:03,659 --> 03:38:04,920
Oh, I still haven't watched that movie.

2044
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:06,920
Dude, it's so good.

2045
03:38:06,920 --> 03:38:09,020
Not to, not to impact the integrity of the moist meter,

2046
03:38:09,020 --> 03:38:10,219
but it was brilliant.

2047
03:38:10,219 --> 03:38:11,159
It was great.

2048
03:38:11,159 --> 03:38:13,120
I've heard nothing but good things about that movie.

2049
03:38:13,120 --> 03:38:13,959
It looks good.

2050
03:38:13,959 --> 03:38:15,360
I just never saw it in theater

2051
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:17,840
and I still haven't watched it on streaming.

2052
03:38:17,840 --> 03:38:18,659
Yeah.

2053
03:38:18,659 --> 03:38:19,799
What about the Black Phone?

2054
03:38:19,799 --> 03:38:21,079
I heard that's really good too.

2055
03:38:21,079 --> 03:38:22,200
I missed that one as well.

2056
03:38:22,200 --> 03:38:24,600
That one also came out when I couldn't go to a theater.

2057
03:38:24,600 --> 03:38:25,559
Wait, you thought that was good?

2058
03:38:25,559 --> 03:38:28,200
I heard that, I heard, I don't think Will liked it.

2059
03:38:28,200 --> 03:38:30,479
And Will is like my go-to for horror movies.

2060
03:38:30,479 --> 03:38:33,719
I haven't seen it.

2061
03:38:33,719 --> 03:38:34,799
It's got pretty good reviews.

2062
03:38:34,799 --> 03:38:36,239
The audience score is pretty good too.

2063
03:38:36,239 --> 03:38:37,659
I don't know.

2064
03:38:37,659 --> 03:38:39,100
It's pretty positively received,

2065
03:38:39,100 --> 03:38:40,659
especially for a horror movie.

2066
03:38:40,659 --> 03:38:43,139
Wait, Charlie, did you watch RRR?

2067
03:38:43,139 --> 03:38:44,620
No, I love Bollywood though,

2068
03:38:44,620 --> 03:38:45,459
so I'm definitely gonna watch it.

2069
03:38:45,459 --> 03:38:46,700
Movie of the summer, movie of the summer.

2070
03:38:46,700 --> 03:38:48,100
Well, if you already like Bollywood,

2071
03:38:48,100 --> 03:38:50,399
you're gonna fucking flip.

2072
03:38:50,399 --> 03:38:51,239
Oh, good.

2073
03:38:51,239 --> 03:38:52,059
I'm excited.

2074
03:38:52,059 --> 03:38:52,899
I've seen the clips on Twitter.

2075
03:38:52,899 --> 03:38:53,739
They're so hype with like the tigers.

2076
03:38:53,739 --> 03:38:55,739
Dude, it is so dumb.

2077
03:38:55,739 --> 03:38:56,860
It's so good.

2078
03:38:56,860 --> 03:38:58,219
It's so fucking good.

2079
03:38:58,219 --> 03:38:59,059
It was bad.

2080
03:38:59,059 --> 03:39:00,540
I think, really?

2081
03:39:00,540 --> 03:39:02,420
Yeah, no, it looks really good, Jerma.

2082
03:39:02,420 --> 03:39:03,680
Do you watch Bollywood at all, Jerma?

2083
03:39:03,680 --> 03:39:04,520
I feel like you'd be a big fan.

2084
03:39:04,520 --> 03:39:05,360
Oh, no, sorry.

2085
03:39:06,040 --> 03:39:07,840
People are saying that Black Phone was bad.

2086
03:39:07,840 --> 03:39:11,590
No, I feel like I would love Bollywood films.

2087
03:39:11,590 --> 03:39:13,030
Yeah, they're right up your alley.

2088
03:39:13,030 --> 03:39:15,549
I feel like something like Gentleman or something

2089
03:39:15,549 --> 03:39:16,549
is so good.

2090
03:39:16,549 --> 03:39:18,549
It's iconic.

2091
03:39:18,549 --> 03:39:20,750
Give me a list of your top five.

2092
03:39:20,750 --> 03:39:22,219
I'll watch them.

2093
03:39:22,219 --> 03:39:23,700
Dude, Gentleman.

2094
03:39:25,700 --> 03:39:26,540
Or top three.

2095
03:39:27,739 --> 03:39:29,420
I think Gentleman, and then there's,

2096
03:39:29,420 --> 03:39:31,139
what's the one with, this one's for Chad.

2097
03:39:31,139 --> 03:39:34,059
The one where the bad guy has a bunch of clones

2098
03:39:34,059 --> 03:39:36,620
and they all form a giant cube, a giant sphere.

2099
03:39:36,620 --> 03:39:37,719
What?

2100
03:39:38,559 --> 03:39:39,399
It's so cool.

2101
03:39:39,399 --> 03:39:40,219
I can never remember the name of it.

2102
03:39:40,219 --> 03:39:41,059
Is it Singham?

2103
03:39:41,059 --> 03:39:41,899
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

2104
03:39:41,899 --> 03:39:43,440
Well, they all get, all the cops get together

2105
03:39:43,440 --> 03:39:45,479
and they become like a giant human cube

2106
03:39:45,479 --> 03:39:47,079
and they start like rolling through town

2107
03:39:47,079 --> 03:39:48,440
like Katamari Damasi.

2108
03:39:48,440 --> 03:39:49,280
It's amazing.

2109
03:39:49,280 --> 03:39:50,600
That movie is, that whole movie is good.

2110
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:51,440
That's just one scene.

2111
03:39:51,440 --> 03:39:52,440
I can't remember the name of it though.

2112
03:39:52,440 --> 03:39:53,280
Oh my God.

2113
03:39:53,280 --> 03:39:54,100
All right.

2114
03:39:54,100 --> 03:39:55,309
I'm interested.

2115
03:39:55,309 --> 03:39:58,530
People are saying Bahubali Indiran, Indian Terminator.

2116
03:39:58,530 --> 03:39:59,989
Is that what it is?

2117
03:39:59,989 --> 03:40:00,829
Might be.

2118
03:40:00,829 --> 03:40:01,870
A lot of people are saying robot

2119
03:40:01,870 --> 03:40:03,149
and I think that's the one.

2120
03:40:03,149 --> 03:40:04,629
I think it's robot.

2121
03:40:04,629 --> 03:40:08,219
Hey, can I get a quick invite, guys?

2122
03:40:08,219 --> 03:40:13,420
Your ELO level's too low, I think, unfortunately.

2123
03:40:13,420 --> 03:40:14,500
Your ELO level.

2124
03:40:14,500 --> 03:40:16,440
Isn't that, that's not what you're supposed to say, right?

2125
03:40:16,440 --> 03:40:17,280
You're supposed to say ELO.

2126
03:40:17,280 --> 03:40:19,000
That's how little of a fucking gamer I am.

2127
03:40:19,000 --> 03:40:20,840
I'm freezing right now, Hassan.

2128
03:40:20,840 --> 03:40:24,639
Here, I just fucking accept my friend request

2129
03:40:24,639 --> 03:40:26,079
so I can easily add you.

2130
03:40:26,079 --> 03:40:26,979
It's getting heated.

2131
03:40:26,979 --> 03:40:27,819
It's getting heated.

2132
03:40:27,819 --> 03:40:28,659
Oh shit.

2133
03:40:28,659 --> 03:40:29,500
Did I do too late to do it?

2134
03:40:29,500 --> 03:40:30,819
All right, give me free.

2135
03:40:30,819 --> 03:40:31,659
Free for all.

2136
03:40:31,659 --> 03:40:33,459
Is this one we want or are we doing just let's play all of it?

2137
03:40:33,459 --> 03:40:34,299
I don't know what I did.

2138
03:40:34,299 --> 03:40:36,239
Good old fashioned free.

2139
03:40:36,239 --> 03:40:38,500
You got it.

2140
03:40:38,500 --> 03:40:44,680
Here, I'll go Superman this time.

2141
03:40:44,680 --> 03:40:46,799
Do you still have latency or are you good now?

2142
03:40:46,799 --> 03:40:48,799
I'm on my third controller.

2143
03:40:48,799 --> 03:40:50,180
It's worked this time.

2144
03:40:50,180 --> 03:40:51,559
Why'd he censored?

2145
03:40:51,559 --> 03:40:53,799
Oh.

2146
03:40:53,799 --> 03:40:54,879
Is it maybe your cable, Ludd?

2147
03:40:54,879 --> 03:40:57,520
Are you using the same cable for every controller?

2148
03:40:57,520 --> 03:41:01,760
I, no, it might be, so it didn't work with cable.

2149
03:41:01,760 --> 03:41:02,600
Oh, it is free.

2150
03:41:02,600 --> 03:41:03,440
It only worked with Bluetooth.

2151
03:41:03,440 --> 03:41:04,479
Oh, gotcha.

2152
03:41:04,479 --> 03:41:06,840
And I tried two controllers and neither worked.

2153
03:41:06,840 --> 03:41:09,079
So I just called it quits after a while.

2154
03:41:09,079 --> 03:41:12,409
Well, then I found a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.

2155
03:41:12,409 --> 03:41:15,610
Oh, that, I love the Pro Controller.

2156
03:41:15,610 --> 03:41:16,809
I think it's a Pro one.

2157
03:41:19,239 --> 03:41:22,590
And here on, and here on.

2158
03:41:22,590 --> 03:41:24,829
That's the one with the forming the giant.

2159
03:41:24,829 --> 03:41:25,750
That's what she's not saying at least.

2160
03:41:25,750 --> 03:41:26,590
I don't know.

2161
03:41:26,590 --> 03:41:27,430
Okay.

2162
03:41:27,430 --> 03:41:28,250
That's the one?

2163
03:41:28,250 --> 03:41:29,090
Yeah, that one is amazing.

2164
03:41:29,090 --> 03:41:32,770
And then another great one is Sing Am.

2165
03:41:32,770 --> 03:41:36,170
Ludd, I have a recommendation for the controller thing.

2166
03:41:36,170 --> 03:41:40,020
Like I have a fix.

2167
03:41:40,020 --> 03:41:41,200
Ludd.

2168
03:41:41,200 --> 03:41:43,000
You versus me again, Clark.

2169
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:44,840
He's dialed in his sign.

2170
03:41:44,840 --> 03:41:45,680
Is he not talking to me?

2171
03:41:45,680 --> 03:41:46,500
Like, what's going on?

2172
03:41:46,500 --> 03:41:47,420
Is he like actually mad at me?

2173
03:41:47,420 --> 03:41:48,520
I don't understand.

2174
03:41:48,520 --> 03:41:50,479
It's called, it's called getting good

2175
03:41:50,479 --> 03:41:51,639
and not dying like that.

2176
03:41:51,639 --> 03:41:53,680
You just did the way you died just now.

2177
03:42:01,350 --> 03:42:02,549
I have not landed a hit right now.

2178
03:42:02,549 --> 03:42:05,690
I am getting absolutely worked.

2179
03:42:05,690 --> 03:42:12,899
Oh, that was a good pickup.

2180
03:42:12,899 --> 03:42:15,120
You know, I really appreciate being able to grab the wall

2181
03:42:15,120 --> 03:42:16,840
because I would have died a thousand more times

2182
03:42:16,840 --> 03:42:18,319
than I already have.

2183
03:42:18,319 --> 03:42:19,159
Yeah, that's huge.

2184
03:42:19,159 --> 03:42:24,700
It's crucial.

2185
03:42:24,700 --> 03:42:25,540
Oh shit.

2186
03:42:34,239 --> 03:42:35,079
Oh.

2187
03:42:51,059 --> 03:42:52,680
Oh.

2188
03:42:52,719 --> 03:42:55,440
I got you with that last hit there.

2189
03:42:55,440 --> 03:42:56,840
That was a good wall up.

2190
03:43:16,270 --> 03:43:19,030
Ludwig, Ludwig, incredible, brilliant technique.

2191
03:43:24,469 --> 03:43:25,510
Oh, fuck you, dude.

2192
03:43:25,510 --> 03:43:26,350
I needed that.

2193
03:43:29,170 --> 03:43:30,610
Trying to get the, the,

2194
03:43:30,610 --> 03:43:32,809
the blow the kiss thing is hard to land.

2195
03:43:32,809 --> 03:43:33,809
Yeah.

2196
03:43:33,809 --> 03:43:35,209
It's good though, when you do.

2197
03:43:48,370 --> 03:43:49,770
Wait, who got the ring out?

2198
03:43:51,770 --> 03:43:53,809
I think it was Jerma.

2199
03:43:53,809 --> 03:43:54,809
What the fuck?

2200
03:43:54,850 --> 03:43:57,170
Jerma is cracked, bro.

2201
03:43:57,170 --> 03:43:59,649
Yeah, Jerma is going nuts.

2202
03:43:59,649 --> 03:44:03,090
Sometimes, sometimes when I'm, when I lock in,

2203
03:44:03,090 --> 03:44:05,450
I pretend to be a gamer for an hour or so.

2204
03:44:08,610 --> 03:44:09,450
Oh no.

2205
03:44:10,610 --> 03:44:12,770
Oh, the, what, the screen is closing in.

2206
03:44:12,770 --> 03:44:13,969
Holy shit.

2207
03:44:13,969 --> 03:44:15,370
What the fuck?

2208
03:44:15,370 --> 03:44:16,370
Dude, this is insane.

2209
03:44:16,370 --> 03:44:18,610
The screen, I didn't know that.

2210
03:44:18,610 --> 03:44:21,209
I just lost, I had it and I lost it big time.

2211
03:44:21,209 --> 03:44:24,260
I got like kicked out.

2212
03:44:24,500 --> 03:44:25,979
That's a pretty funny feature.

2213
03:44:25,979 --> 03:44:26,819
You actually, the screen.

2214
03:44:26,819 --> 03:44:27,700
Wait, where should I put the camera?

2215
03:44:27,700 --> 03:44:30,020
Where are you guys putting the camera?

2216
03:44:30,020 --> 03:44:31,659
I did bottom left.

2217
03:44:31,659 --> 03:44:38,020
Holy shit, Lud.

2218
03:44:38,020 --> 03:44:39,420
Okay, one second, one second.

2219
03:44:39,420 --> 03:44:41,610
Hey man, it's.

2220
03:44:41,610 --> 03:44:42,450
It's all right.

2221
03:44:42,450 --> 03:44:43,290
It's okay.

2222
03:44:43,290 --> 03:44:44,129
It's okay.

2223
03:44:44,129 --> 03:44:46,219
It's all right, what, it's.

2224
03:44:46,219 --> 03:45:01,020
It is, yeah, no, you're, you're doing great.

2225
03:45:01,020 --> 03:45:04,059
More thief, more free.

2226
03:45:04,059 --> 03:45:05,100
More free for all?

2227
03:45:05,100 --> 03:45:06,659
Yeah, you can, you can run some more thief

2228
03:45:06,659 --> 03:45:07,780
while we wait for him.

2229
03:45:11,750 --> 03:45:12,590
No.

2230
03:45:12,590 --> 03:45:13,790
Choose your character.

2231
03:45:13,790 --> 03:45:15,829
Dude, how much water is in a pitcher of water?

2232
03:45:15,829 --> 03:45:20,129
That's like 60 ounces or whatever this is.

2233
03:45:20,129 --> 03:45:20,969
Excuse me, what?

2234
03:45:20,969 --> 03:45:22,209
Nevermind.

2235
03:45:22,209 --> 03:45:24,409
Everyone forget I said anything.

2236
03:45:24,409 --> 03:45:27,120
How much water is in this, do you think?

2237
03:45:27,120 --> 03:45:29,639
Like how much, how much water do you think is in this?

2238
03:45:29,639 --> 03:45:31,340
Like 60 ounces?

2239
03:45:31,340 --> 03:45:33,340
Yeah, yeah.

2240
03:45:33,340 --> 03:45:37,700
Wait, Ludwig left again.

2241
03:45:37,700 --> 03:45:38,739
Send me another invite as well.

2242
03:45:38,739 --> 03:45:41,739
I'm gonna restart my game real quick.

2243
03:45:41,739 --> 03:45:42,700
All right, I'll remove you.

2244
03:45:42,700 --> 03:45:46,370
Ludwig keeps leaving.

2245
03:45:46,370 --> 03:45:47,250
Why are you drinking out of a pitcher?

2246
03:45:47,250 --> 03:46:00,670
Because I, I don't, I don't have any clean cups.

2247
03:46:00,670 --> 03:46:08,750
Earwigs are eating his grave matter again.

2248
03:46:08,750 --> 03:46:09,909
Do your dishes?

2249
03:46:09,909 --> 03:46:24,270
Dude, they're all in the dishwasher.

2250
03:46:24,270 --> 03:46:25,350
Holly and I have been sick,

2251
03:46:25,350 --> 03:46:32,700
so we just ran a dishwasher and it is,

2252
03:46:32,700 --> 03:46:34,659
this is not a vase for a flower, dude.

2253
03:46:34,659 --> 03:46:46,229
It's a, it's a pitcher.

2254
03:46:46,229 --> 03:46:47,629
You're too sick to press a button.

2255
03:46:47,629 --> 03:46:48,590
I just told you that everything's

2256
03:46:48,590 --> 03:46:54,120
in the dishwasher right now.

2257
03:46:54,120 --> 03:46:56,200
No, I didn't shit in the dishwasher.

2258
03:46:56,200 --> 03:47:01,639
It's tying people up for saying that.

2259
03:47:01,639 --> 03:47:03,440
Why would I do, I'm gonna like do a shit

2260
03:47:03,440 --> 03:47:06,559
in the dishwasher prank thing to my own dishwasher.

2261
03:47:06,559 --> 03:47:07,479
What are you talking about?

2262
03:47:07,479 --> 03:47:09,639
Dude, what are you saying right now, Jerma?

2263
03:47:09,639 --> 03:47:10,479
What is happening on your stream?

2264
03:47:10,479 --> 03:47:14,139
I'm fighting, my chat is, has lost their mind.

2265
03:47:14,139 --> 03:47:15,379
They keep talking about how I've,

2266
03:47:15,379 --> 03:47:18,079
you heard me, I didn't just repeat it.

2267
03:47:18,079 --> 03:47:20,969
Yeah, shit in a dishwasher prank?

2268
03:47:20,969 --> 03:47:22,969
They're saying, they're saying that like I did that

2269
03:47:22,969 --> 03:47:29,409
and it's making me very upset.

2270
03:47:29,409 --> 03:47:39,319
It was one guy.

2271
03:47:39,319 --> 03:47:40,680
What's that on stream losing to you,

2272
03:47:40,680 --> 03:47:42,000
put him in a mental crisis?

2273
03:47:42,000 --> 03:47:45,559
Oh no.

2274
03:47:45,559 --> 03:47:48,639
We gotta get Ludwig a wired controller

2275
03:47:48,639 --> 03:47:49,959
that has point zero milliseconds.

2276
03:47:49,959 --> 03:47:51,959
Someone in my TTS just asked,

2277
03:47:51,959 --> 03:47:53,680
Chad, who is Jerma, is he a criminal?

2278
03:47:53,680 --> 03:47:54,520
What do you think, Jerma?

2279
03:47:54,520 --> 03:47:55,639
What's your answer to that?

2280
03:47:55,639 --> 03:47:58,239
I'm just a guy in his late thirties.

2281
03:47:58,239 --> 03:48:01,020
That's exactly what a criminal would say.

2282
03:48:01,020 --> 03:48:02,879
Hey, Hassan, I got a question for you.

2283
03:48:02,879 --> 03:48:03,719
What's up?

2284
03:48:03,719 --> 03:48:06,120
So when you're done, when you're not streaming, right?

2285
03:48:06,120 --> 03:48:07,459
Mm-hmm.

2286
03:48:07,459 --> 03:48:10,219
What do you do for the other,

2287
03:48:10,219 --> 03:48:13,440
how much free time do you think you have after a stream?

2288
03:48:13,440 --> 03:48:17,659
So I just, I stream usually like around eight hours

2289
03:48:18,340 --> 03:48:19,459
at a minimum every day, right?

2290
03:48:19,459 --> 03:48:20,729
Right.

2291
03:48:20,729 --> 03:48:26,030
And I will, before I start streaming, I wake up early,

2292
03:48:26,829 --> 03:48:31,229
I read the news and I throw on, you know, like the NPR,

2293
03:48:31,229 --> 03:48:34,649
the NPR links, like the radio updates.

2294
03:48:34,649 --> 03:48:35,489
You know what I mean?

2295
03:48:35,489 --> 03:48:36,309
Okay.

2296
03:48:36,309 --> 03:48:37,149
It was just like straightforward.

2297
03:48:37,149 --> 03:48:37,989
It's like read it.

2298
03:48:37,989 --> 03:48:39,409
It's like an AP readout basically.

2299
03:48:39,409 --> 03:48:41,700
But after stream.

2300
03:48:41,700 --> 03:48:42,540
What?

2301
03:48:42,540 --> 03:48:43,860
Like after your stream, like when you're done.

2302
03:48:43,860 --> 03:48:44,899
No, no, no, before my stream.

2303
03:48:44,899 --> 03:48:45,819
I'm giving you everything.

2304
03:48:45,819 --> 03:48:46,659
Like in the morning I wake up.

2305
03:48:46,659 --> 03:48:47,500
This is his whole day.

2306
03:48:47,739 --> 03:48:49,579
I get the whole day.

2307
03:48:49,579 --> 03:48:50,780
Yeah, you're getting the full day.

2308
03:48:50,780 --> 03:48:52,620
You asked for it even though you didn't ask

2309
03:48:52,620 --> 03:48:53,459
for the full day.

2310
03:48:53,459 --> 03:48:54,299
Okay.

2311
03:48:54,299 --> 03:48:55,120
That's what I do.

2312
03:48:55,120 --> 03:48:55,959
And then I go work out.

2313
03:48:55,959 --> 03:49:00,319
I train with a trainer and then afterwards I do more reading

2314
03:49:00,319 --> 03:49:03,729
and like get, you know, finish whatever the fuck

2315
03:49:03,729 --> 03:49:06,100
I needed to do, like to be an adult.

2316
03:49:06,100 --> 03:49:11,239
And I start my stream at 11, 11 to usually seven,

2317
03:49:11,239 --> 03:49:13,639
eight, whatever I'm streaming.

2318
03:49:13,639 --> 03:49:15,879
And then afterwards, once I'm done,

2319
03:49:15,879 --> 03:49:20,030
probably watch like anime, movies, eat dinner,

2320
03:49:20,590 --> 03:49:24,260
so that's about an hour or two.

2321
03:49:24,260 --> 03:49:25,100
Yeah.

2322
03:49:25,100 --> 03:49:26,299
And then I go to sleep.

2323
03:49:26,299 --> 03:49:31,180
So you end the stream, you watch like two or three episodes

2324
03:49:31,180 --> 03:49:34,020
of anime, eat and then go to sleep.

2325
03:49:34,020 --> 03:49:34,860
Not two or three.

2326
03:49:34,860 --> 03:49:38,379
I watch a lot of like movies and shit too.

2327
03:49:38,379 --> 03:49:39,780
So you're watching probably, let's say.

2328
03:49:39,780 --> 03:49:40,620
Very routine.

2329
03:49:40,620 --> 03:49:42,590
Four or five movies a day?

2330
03:49:42,590 --> 03:49:44,370
No, no, no, no.

2331
03:49:44,370 --> 03:49:46,450
So what are you doing with that other time then?

2332
03:49:46,450 --> 03:49:47,290
I don't know.

2333
03:49:47,290 --> 03:49:49,090
I just like, I literally just chill.

2334
03:49:49,090 --> 03:49:53,299
I, like I said, I eat dinner, I watch some movies,

2335
03:49:53,299 --> 03:49:55,540
I watch some anime and then I go to sleep.

2336
03:49:55,540 --> 03:49:56,379
God damn it.

2337
03:49:56,379 --> 03:49:58,540
It sounds so fucking bad when I just go to sleep.

2338
03:49:58,540 --> 03:49:59,819
Yeah, it was actually kind of sad.

2339
03:49:59,819 --> 03:50:02,100
Like I was just on the sidelines listening and feeling bad.

2340
03:50:02,100 --> 03:50:02,940
But my point-

2341
03:50:02,940 --> 03:50:03,780
Holy fuck.

2342
03:50:03,780 --> 03:50:05,340
Okay, I do a lot of cool stuff.

2343
03:50:05,340 --> 03:50:07,059
Yeah, but you can't even explain it, right?

2344
03:50:07,059 --> 03:50:08,159
I have sex with women.

2345
03:50:08,159 --> 03:50:09,159
Yeah, but you can't explain it.

2346
03:50:09,159 --> 03:50:10,860
You can't explain like what you do,

2347
03:50:10,860 --> 03:50:13,370
just normally just kind of hanging out, right?

2348
03:50:13,370 --> 03:50:14,569
No, literally that's all I do.

2349
03:50:14,569 --> 03:50:17,950
Like I just, I watch, I watch anime,

2350
03:50:17,950 --> 03:50:19,430
I watch movies and that's it.

2351
03:50:19,430 --> 03:50:20,510
And I eat food.

2352
03:50:20,510 --> 03:50:21,350
People-

2353
03:50:21,350 --> 03:50:22,170
Sometimes I'll link up with some friends.

2354
03:50:22,170 --> 03:50:24,569
Like I'll go out to like a restaurant or something.

2355
03:50:24,569 --> 03:50:26,010
Yeah, people thought I was crazy because they were like,

2356
03:50:26,010 --> 03:50:27,850
oh, what do you do for the other time you're off stream?

2357
03:50:27,850 --> 03:50:31,420
Like you mentioned like the, oh, he's a killer, right?

2358
03:50:31,420 --> 03:50:33,899
Oh, that's something a killer would say.

2359
03:50:33,899 --> 03:50:35,840
I said the same exact shit.

2360
03:50:35,840 --> 03:50:36,879
I stopped the stream.

2361
03:50:36,879 --> 03:50:40,020
You're being a little too defensive there, okay?

2362
03:50:40,020 --> 03:50:42,420
That was like, sounds like what a killer would say.

2363
03:50:42,420 --> 03:50:44,620
But you can't explain what you do in a day.

2364
03:50:44,620 --> 03:50:45,940
You're just kind of like, okay, I do this

2365
03:50:45,940 --> 03:50:48,239
and then I hang out for a little bit.

2366
03:50:48,239 --> 03:50:49,440
Jerma, why does it sound like you're looking

2367
03:50:49,440 --> 03:50:53,020
for an alibi right now?

2368
03:50:53,020 --> 03:50:53,860
I don't need an alibi.

2369
03:50:53,860 --> 03:50:56,700
I'm playing multiverses with some buds.

2370
03:50:56,700 --> 03:50:58,500
No, not right now, I'm saying.

2371
03:50:58,500 --> 03:51:00,219
You mean like later?

2372
03:51:02,229 --> 03:51:03,709
Yeah, what would you say if like,

2373
03:51:03,709 --> 03:51:06,110
let's say like, you know, cops knock on your door, right?

2374
03:51:06,110 --> 03:51:07,909
I mean, I'm just in a hypothetical situation

2375
03:51:07,909 --> 03:51:12,010
and they're like, hey, where were you during, you know,

2376
03:51:12,010 --> 03:51:15,850
8 p.m. and 10 p.m. when this person was murdered?

2377
03:51:15,850 --> 03:51:17,940
Like, where were you?

2378
03:51:17,940 --> 03:51:19,659
Like, what would you say hypothetically to that?

2379
03:51:19,659 --> 03:51:21,139
That's what it sounds like.

2380
03:51:21,139 --> 03:51:23,139
Probably in the bathroom, if I'm honest.

2381
03:51:25,139 --> 03:51:27,040
Probably, actually probably in the bathroom.

2382
03:51:27,040 --> 03:51:30,790
I was in the bathroom.

2383
03:51:30,790 --> 03:51:32,049
Jerma legit kills people.

2384
03:51:32,049 --> 03:51:34,309
There were 984 previous Jermas.

2385
03:51:34,309 --> 03:51:35,149
He ended them all.

2386
03:51:35,149 --> 03:51:36,309
Is this true?

2387
03:51:36,309 --> 03:51:40,510
No, don't believe everything you read on the internet,

2388
03:51:42,879 --> 03:51:44,959
especially in a chat room on Twitch TV.

2389
03:51:47,719 --> 03:51:49,639
Wait, you mean to tell me that people lie on the internet?

2390
03:51:49,639 --> 03:51:50,639
What the fuck?

2391
03:51:50,639 --> 03:51:52,819
I lied to Charlie earlier.

2392
03:51:52,819 --> 03:51:53,659
What did you say?

2393
03:51:53,659 --> 03:51:55,219
What did you lie about?

2394
03:51:55,219 --> 03:51:56,260
I remember you caught me when I said

2395
03:51:56,260 --> 03:51:57,620
that I was playing as Jake.

2396
03:51:57,620 --> 03:52:00,059
Oh, that's true, that's true, yeah.

2397
03:52:00,059 --> 03:52:02,379
That was a bold face lie for no reason.

2398
03:52:02,379 --> 03:52:04,229
That was just bad manners.

2399
03:52:04,229 --> 03:52:06,350
See, deceit, deceit is in the blood.

2400
03:52:06,350 --> 03:52:09,190
Is Ludwig in an engineering room

2401
03:52:09,190 --> 03:52:11,229
crafting a controller right now?

2402
03:52:11,229 --> 03:52:14,350
Is he like soldering a chips?

2403
03:52:14,350 --> 03:52:15,510
Where is he?

2404
03:52:15,510 --> 03:52:17,709
Bro, this is what happens when you can't do react content

2405
03:52:17,709 --> 03:52:19,790
because you're streaming on YouTube, L.

2406
03:52:19,790 --> 03:52:21,829
He sent Cutie to GameStop to pick up

2407
03:52:21,829 --> 03:52:23,370
an old Xbox controller.

2408
03:52:26,170 --> 03:52:27,010
He's playing?

2409
03:52:27,010 --> 03:52:29,069
How does he not have a single fucking wired controller?

2410
03:52:29,069 --> 03:52:31,299
Hold on, he's playing another game?

2411
03:52:31,299 --> 03:52:32,139
What?

2412
03:52:32,139 --> 03:52:32,979
He's not?

2413
03:52:32,979 --> 03:52:33,799
What?

2414
03:52:33,799 --> 03:52:35,020
No, he's not, dude.

2415
03:52:35,020 --> 03:52:37,100
No shot.

2416
03:52:37,100 --> 03:52:38,530
Hello, hello.

2417
03:52:38,530 --> 03:52:39,610
Are you playing a different game?

2418
03:52:39,610 --> 03:52:41,129
Are you fucking joking?

2419
03:52:41,129 --> 03:52:43,049
Were you training?

2420
03:52:43,049 --> 03:52:45,129
No, I haven't.

2421
03:52:45,129 --> 03:52:47,979
Okay, you guys are misrepresenting me.

2422
03:52:47,979 --> 03:52:48,819
I haven't had a-

2423
03:52:48,819 --> 03:52:52,219
Hey, no way are you fucking training right now.

2424
03:52:52,219 --> 03:52:55,219
I was trying to figure out the controllers.

2425
03:52:55,219 --> 03:52:58,059
Bro, you are literally the sweatiest motherfucker

2426
03:52:58,059 --> 03:52:59,979
I've ever seen in my life, dude.

2427
03:52:59,979 --> 03:53:01,059
Are you okay?

2428
03:53:01,059 --> 03:53:02,540
I played one game with controller today.

2429
03:53:03,219 --> 03:53:04,659
I don't even know what buttons I'm supposed to press.

2430
03:53:04,659 --> 03:53:05,500
Are you fucking-

2431
03:53:05,500 --> 03:53:06,340
Did you get one working?

2432
03:53:06,340 --> 03:53:09,739
Dude, I don't know how to play video games at all.

2433
03:53:09,739 --> 03:53:10,940
You've beaten Elden Ring.

2434
03:53:10,940 --> 03:53:13,280
Stop misrepresenting yourself.

2435
03:53:13,280 --> 03:53:15,719
Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you, bro?

2436
03:53:15,719 --> 03:53:18,040
Stop playing more games

2437
03:53:18,040 --> 03:53:19,559
and get in the fucking lobby, Lon.

2438
03:53:19,559 --> 03:53:21,360
We're waiting for you.

2439
03:53:21,360 --> 03:53:22,200
I'm ready, I'm ready.

2440
03:53:22,200 --> 03:53:23,040
True.

2441
03:53:23,040 --> 03:53:26,530
Hold on, let me finish beating this kid

2442
03:53:26,530 --> 03:53:27,370
and then I'll be there.

2443
03:53:27,370 --> 03:53:28,690
I want to see it.

2444
03:53:28,690 --> 03:53:30,930
The music in the background makes this conversation

2445
03:53:30,930 --> 03:53:33,760
way funnier, by the way.

2446
03:53:33,799 --> 03:53:35,479
Oh my God, is this like,

2447
03:53:35,479 --> 03:53:37,479
are you giving me a gift today or something?

2448
03:53:37,479 --> 03:53:40,920
Because you feel bad that you betray me all the time?

2449
03:53:40,920 --> 03:53:42,239
Like when you gave the shirt,

2450
03:53:42,239 --> 03:53:44,840
our friendship shirt to Crazy Slick?

2451
03:53:44,840 --> 03:53:49,059
No.

2452
03:53:49,059 --> 03:53:49,899
What?

2453
03:53:49,899 --> 03:53:52,260
So you're just delivering L's to me

2454
03:53:52,260 --> 03:53:54,180
to make me look like a better gamer or something?

2455
03:53:54,180 --> 03:53:55,020
Is that why?

2456
03:53:55,020 --> 03:53:59,260
I think you are doing really good today, sweetheart.

2457
03:53:59,260 --> 03:54:03,420
I'm just gonna start inviting Lyric to this party.

2458
03:54:03,420 --> 03:54:06,219
Yeah, I bet Lyric wouldn't be fucking,

2459
03:54:06,260 --> 03:54:07,260
I bet Lyric wouldn't be like,

2460
03:54:07,260 --> 03:54:09,940
dicking around playing in like other lobbies,

2461
03:54:09,940 --> 03:54:11,139
waiting for us to cool down.

2462
03:54:11,139 --> 03:54:11,979
You know what I mean?

2463
03:54:11,979 --> 03:54:14,379
I would say, when you cool down like there's a meter,

2464
03:54:14,379 --> 03:54:15,700
you have a certain meter of ability.

2465
03:54:15,700 --> 03:54:17,260
Yeah, there's a moist meter, bitch.

2466
03:54:17,260 --> 03:54:19,219
Okay, hold on.

2467
03:54:19,219 --> 03:54:21,540
You still have not accepted my friend request,

2468
03:54:21,540 --> 03:54:22,379
which is fine.

2469
03:54:22,379 --> 03:54:27,420
I'll just keep doing custom game invites.

2470
03:54:27,420 --> 03:54:29,540
I'm kicking my legs under my chair right now.

2471
03:54:29,540 --> 03:54:32,069
I think Shaggy's good.

2472
03:54:32,069 --> 03:54:33,590
Shaggy is really good.

2473
03:54:33,590 --> 03:54:35,030
Shaggy is nuts.

2474
03:54:35,030 --> 03:54:35,870
Yeah.

2475
03:54:35,870 --> 03:54:36,690
If you know how to play.

2476
03:54:36,690 --> 03:54:40,180
I'll use Shaggy if you're a real one.

2477
03:54:40,180 --> 03:54:42,139
All right, I'm ready, I'm ready.

2478
03:54:46,530 --> 03:54:49,219
The music's so spiritual.

2479
03:54:49,219 --> 03:54:51,309
It's really good.

2480
03:54:51,309 --> 03:54:53,870
It's like John Williams in the booth.

2481
03:54:53,870 --> 03:54:57,989
All right, who is your most sought after potential,

2482
03:54:57,989 --> 03:54:59,950
like we're talking the whole Warner Brothers universe.

2483
03:54:59,950 --> 03:55:03,959
Who would you like to see in the game?

2484
03:55:03,959 --> 03:55:07,280
Remember, Warner Brothers owns a lot of property.

2485
03:55:07,280 --> 03:55:08,120
Yeah, I think.

2486
03:55:08,120 --> 03:55:09,639
I'd literally have to go Google.

2487
03:55:09,639 --> 03:55:11,040
I think they have Cartoon Network,

2488
03:55:11,040 --> 03:55:13,440
so Courage the Cowardly Dog for me.

2489
03:55:13,440 --> 03:55:14,440
That would be awesome.

2490
03:55:14,440 --> 03:55:15,280
That'd be so hype.

2491
03:55:15,280 --> 03:55:17,040
You own all of Cartoon Network?

2492
03:55:17,040 --> 03:55:18,200
I think so.

2493
03:55:18,840 --> 03:55:21,000
Do they own Hanna-Barbera, too, like all of it?

2494
03:55:21,000 --> 03:55:22,399
I'm pretty sure.

2495
03:55:22,399 --> 03:55:23,319
Do they own Toonami?

2496
03:55:23,319 --> 03:55:24,319
They do.

2497
03:55:24,319 --> 03:55:25,760
I want Cowboy Bebop.

2498
03:55:25,760 --> 03:55:28,000
I want Spike Siegel.

2499
03:55:28,000 --> 03:55:30,319
Oh, LeBron James would be kind of nuts.

2500
03:55:30,319 --> 03:55:32,549
Yo.

2501
03:55:32,549 --> 03:55:33,389
I just want Daffy Duck.

2502
03:55:33,389 --> 03:55:35,940
Send me another invite.

2503
03:55:35,940 --> 03:55:36,780
Be honest.

2504
03:55:38,069 --> 03:55:39,350
Did you say, give me an invite?

2505
03:55:39,350 --> 03:55:40,469
Yeah, send me another invite.

2506
03:55:40,469 --> 03:55:42,309
Daffy Duck and Fred Flintstone.

2507
03:55:42,309 --> 03:55:44,319
Here you go.

2508
03:55:44,319 --> 03:55:49,590
They own TBS.

2509
03:55:49,590 --> 03:55:53,430
Okay, I'm in.

2510
03:55:53,430 --> 03:55:54,989
The Road Runner?

2511
03:55:54,989 --> 03:55:59,159
Oh, that would be awesome.

2512
03:55:59,159 --> 03:56:07,000
The Road Runner would seriously be awesome.

2513
03:56:07,000 --> 03:56:10,840
Dude, I miss desktop streaming so much

2514
03:56:10,840 --> 03:56:12,280
when I was doing the IRLs and stuff

2515
03:56:12,280 --> 03:56:13,879
and doing desktop streams from the hotel.

2516
03:56:13,879 --> 03:56:15,840
It does not hit the same

2517
03:56:15,840 --> 03:56:22,559
when you're just sitting in your house and doing it.

2518
03:56:22,559 --> 03:56:24,360
Okay, this was feedback.

2519
03:56:24,360 --> 03:56:28,079
I was looking for feedback from a lobby full of streamers.

2520
03:56:28,079 --> 03:56:28,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2521
03:56:28,920 --> 03:56:31,159
I want to be like, oh, I don't know.

2522
03:56:31,159 --> 03:56:32,000
It's crazy.

2523
03:56:32,000 --> 03:56:34,159
I don't feel that way at all.

2524
03:56:34,159 --> 03:56:35,840
That is just kind of nuts, actually.

2525
03:56:35,840 --> 03:56:37,719
Dude, I was in my own world.

2526
03:56:38,600 --> 03:56:39,440
I was literally in my own world.

2527
03:56:39,440 --> 03:56:40,280
I wasn't, I'm sorry.

2528
03:56:40,280 --> 03:56:41,120
No, it's cool, guys.

2529
03:56:41,120 --> 03:56:42,879
I'll just fuck myself.

2530
03:56:42,879 --> 03:56:46,719
I was just reading everyone in chat's most wanted characters

2531
03:56:46,719 --> 03:56:48,360
and I was going, that looks good, that looks good,

2532
03:56:48,360 --> 03:56:49,200
that looks good.

2533
03:56:49,200 --> 03:56:50,440
I just thought of a genius one

2534
03:56:50,440 --> 03:56:54,920
and it's because TBS is owned by the Warner Brothers

2535
03:56:54,920 --> 03:56:57,600
and they streamed Ely Counter-Strike.

2536
03:56:57,600 --> 03:57:02,229
So I want Tarek from C9 Counter-Strike.

2537
03:57:02,229 --> 03:57:03,909
Just with a sniper rifle.

2538
03:57:05,719 --> 03:57:07,760
Thank you, Reany, baby.

2539
03:57:07,840 --> 03:57:09,079
Dude, the mask?

2540
03:57:09,079 --> 03:57:11,969
No way.

2541
03:57:11,969 --> 03:57:15,129
Well, I did not pick Shaggy, so you shouldn't either.

2542
03:57:15,129 --> 03:57:16,250
Is the mask Warner Brothers?

2543
03:57:16,250 --> 03:57:17,610
Wait, I snap-picked him.

2544
03:57:19,719 --> 03:57:23,959
I also have a, oh God, I don't like perks,

2545
03:57:23,959 --> 03:57:25,920
but I guess you get them pretty early, so it's fine.

2546
03:57:25,920 --> 03:57:26,959
Perks are pretty helpful, yeah.

2547
03:57:26,959 --> 03:57:27,799
Just auto-equip them.

2548
03:57:27,799 --> 03:57:29,159
You don't need them.

2549
03:57:29,159 --> 03:57:30,440
Dude, the mask would be insane.

2550
03:57:30,440 --> 03:57:32,840
I don't have any promote characters.

2551
03:57:32,840 --> 03:57:33,680
At level 10 for Shaggy, you'd get a great one.

2552
03:57:33,680 --> 03:57:34,520
I want that there's a leak

2553
03:57:34,520 --> 03:57:37,110
that LeBron is going to be a DLC.

2554
03:57:37,110 --> 03:57:38,709
That'd be great. Prepare yourself.

2555
03:57:38,709 --> 03:57:39,549
I can see that.

2556
03:57:40,950 --> 03:57:42,670
That makes sense.

2557
03:57:42,670 --> 03:57:43,870
I wouldn't play any other character

2558
03:57:43,870 --> 03:57:44,989
if the mask was in the game.

2559
03:57:44,989 --> 03:57:49,680
I would have like a thousand hours on him.

2560
03:57:49,680 --> 03:57:50,799
Steve Urkel?

2561
03:57:50,799 --> 03:57:54,709
Steve Urkel is not, is Steve Urkel Warner Brothers?

2562
03:57:54,709 --> 03:57:55,549
Maybe.

2563
03:57:55,549 --> 03:57:59,549
They have their hand in a lot of pies, I think it could be.

2564
03:57:59,549 --> 03:58:00,989
Oh, Jesus.

2565
03:58:00,989 --> 03:58:02,270
I think it's a 1v1.

2566
03:58:02,270 --> 03:58:03,110
Oh, is it a 1v1?

2567
03:58:03,110 --> 03:58:05,670
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

2568
03:58:05,670 --> 03:58:06,510
What the fuck?

2569
03:58:06,510 --> 03:58:07,829
Jesus, leave me alone.

2570
03:58:07,829 --> 03:58:08,790
Is it a 1v1 or not?

2571
03:58:08,790 --> 03:58:09,629
Is this a 1v1?

2572
03:58:09,629 --> 03:58:10,590
Have we confirmed?

2573
03:58:10,590 --> 03:58:11,629
Wait, what do you mean?

2574
03:58:11,629 --> 03:58:12,469
It closes in.

2575
03:58:12,469 --> 03:58:13,549
Oh, are we doing a 1v1?

2576
03:58:14,190 --> 03:58:15,030
No, no, this stage sucks for that.

2577
03:58:15,030 --> 03:58:16,190
All right, all right.

2578
03:58:16,190 --> 03:58:18,309
You know how it closes in and stuff?

2579
03:58:18,309 --> 03:58:20,629
That's every stage though, when you do a free roll.

2580
03:58:20,629 --> 03:58:21,909
This one specifically goes to the edges

2581
03:58:21,909 --> 03:58:23,629
in the middle island.

2582
03:58:25,200 --> 03:58:26,600
Oh shit, no!

2583
03:58:26,600 --> 03:58:27,920
George Costanza?

2584
03:58:27,920 --> 03:58:29,319
I don't think that's Warner Brothers.

2585
03:58:29,319 --> 03:58:30,639
Don't do that, don't do that.

2586
03:58:30,639 --> 03:58:32,680
Come on, Mois, why are you edge guarding?

2587
03:58:33,680 --> 03:58:35,319
Oh, that was the right term.

2588
03:58:35,319 --> 03:58:36,799
Well, you're kind of a gamer.

2589
03:58:36,799 --> 03:58:37,920
Dude, dude, I know.

2590
03:58:37,920 --> 03:58:39,440
You said I'm a gamer twice today

2591
03:58:39,440 --> 03:58:41,239
and it's made me feel so good.

2592
03:58:41,239 --> 03:58:43,000
You're using the right terminology.

2593
03:58:46,809 --> 03:58:48,889
Oh, what the fuck is that?

2594
03:58:48,889 --> 03:59:01,159
It's called Velma.

2595
03:59:01,159 --> 03:59:02,000
I want that health.

2596
03:59:02,000 --> 03:59:04,059
Yabba dabba doo.

2597
03:59:04,059 --> 03:59:13,950
Yabba dabba doo.

2598
03:59:13,950 --> 03:59:15,709
Oh no!

2599
03:59:15,709 --> 03:59:17,149
Okay, now I'm playing like shit.

2600
03:59:17,149 --> 03:59:17,989
It's not good.

2601
03:59:23,620 --> 03:59:24,459
Gotcha.

2602
03:59:24,459 --> 03:59:25,940
Oh my goodness, all those bounces

2603
03:59:25,940 --> 03:59:27,940
were exactly what I needed.

2604
03:59:27,940 --> 03:59:36,700
Oh my gosh, what a dumpster.

2605
03:59:36,700 --> 03:59:47,209
What the fuck, Velma?

2606
03:59:47,209 --> 03:59:50,819
There I go.

2607
03:59:50,819 --> 03:59:51,659
What the fuck?

2608
03:59:51,659 --> 03:59:53,860
How are you doing that?

2609
03:59:53,860 --> 03:59:57,639
I'm coming for you.

2610
03:59:57,639 --> 03:59:59,760
Oh my God.

2611
03:59:59,760 --> 04:00:01,239
Oh my God.

2612
04:00:01,239 --> 04:00:03,159
I'm getting fucking destroyed right now.

2613
04:00:03,159 --> 04:00:05,760
Everyone is, why is everybody farming me?

2614
04:00:05,760 --> 04:00:06,600
Everybody calm down.

2615
04:00:06,600 --> 04:00:08,579
Don't hit me anymore, please.

2616
04:00:08,579 --> 04:00:09,860
Oh, no jumps.

2617
04:00:24,579 --> 04:00:26,420
Oh boy.

2618
04:00:26,420 --> 04:00:27,260
That's not good.

2619
04:00:27,260 --> 04:00:28,700
Oh my God, what just happened?

2620
04:00:29,700 --> 04:00:30,540
God.

2621
04:00:30,540 --> 04:00:33,219
All right, I still held it even with that chaos.

2622
04:00:33,219 --> 04:00:34,860
I think I clutched up in the last second,

2623
04:00:34,860 --> 04:00:35,819
but then I died.

2624
04:00:35,819 --> 04:00:36,700
I got annihilated.

2625
04:00:36,700 --> 04:00:37,540
I don't know.

2626
04:00:37,540 --> 04:00:40,680
I actually don't know what happened.

2627
04:00:40,680 --> 04:00:43,159
Is there a stock game mode?

2628
04:00:43,840 --> 04:00:45,760
That'd be swag.

2629
04:00:45,760 --> 04:00:48,079
Hey man, I'm really glad you fixed your controller,

2630
04:00:48,079 --> 04:00:48,920
by the way.

2631
04:00:48,920 --> 04:00:49,760
That was really good.

2632
04:00:49,760 --> 04:00:50,600
It was a good performance.

2633
04:00:50,600 --> 04:00:51,440
I mean, 12 points.

2634
04:00:51,440 --> 04:00:52,280
So here you go.

2635
04:00:52,280 --> 04:00:55,319
I'm gonna, you know what, I'm gonna toast you.

2636
04:00:55,319 --> 04:01:00,409
That just means you are better at kill stealing,

2637
04:01:00,409 --> 04:01:01,250
which is fine.

2638
04:01:02,209 --> 04:01:03,889
You sure you want to leave the lobby?

2639
04:01:03,889 --> 04:01:07,120
No, I am not sure.

2640
04:01:07,120 --> 04:01:09,680
Tony Soprano is Warner Brothers?

2641
04:01:09,680 --> 04:01:13,969
Yo.

2642
04:01:13,969 --> 04:01:15,649
I don't know how accurate all these are, by the way.

2643
04:01:15,649 --> 04:01:20,010
I'm just saying what people are saying in chat.

2644
04:01:20,049 --> 04:01:21,370
Warner Bros. characters.

2645
04:01:25,659 --> 04:01:26,500
Let's change it up.

2646
04:01:26,500 --> 04:01:27,780
I'll try something different.

2647
04:01:27,780 --> 04:01:29,819
Yeah, I'm gonna do a different character here as well.

2648
04:01:29,819 --> 04:01:31,100
Yeah, definitely don't do Shaggy.

2649
04:01:31,100 --> 04:01:34,600
Wait, Harry Potter is Warner Bros.

2650
04:01:34,600 --> 04:01:35,440
Imagine?

2651
04:01:35,440 --> 04:01:37,440
In Neo from the Matrix.

2652
04:01:37,440 --> 04:01:39,760
Do you guys want to change the game?

2653
04:01:39,760 --> 04:01:42,559
Oh, fuck, I started already, but wait, hold on.

2654
04:01:42,559 --> 04:01:43,399
Back to the lobby.

2655
04:01:43,399 --> 04:01:45,120
What do you mean by this?

2656
04:01:45,120 --> 04:01:47,319
Yeah, you can put stocks on.

2657
04:01:47,319 --> 04:01:48,319
Here, I put Moist.

2658
04:01:48,319 --> 04:01:49,639
You're the party leader.

2659
04:01:49,639 --> 04:01:50,920
Go ahead, do your thing.

2660
04:01:51,760 --> 04:01:54,239
All right.

2661
04:01:54,799 --> 04:01:56,940
I don't know where to do that.

2662
04:01:56,940 --> 04:02:00,190
Oh, you get like little missions, this is cool.

2663
04:02:00,190 --> 04:02:03,120
Can you put stocks on?

2664
04:02:03,120 --> 04:02:07,190
Highest score win.

2665
04:02:07,190 --> 04:02:08,389
How's Aria?

2666
04:02:08,389 --> 04:02:09,850
Is Aria good?

2667
04:02:09,850 --> 04:02:12,149
Yeah.

2668
04:02:12,149 --> 04:02:16,209
Well, she was in the tech test.

2669
04:02:16,209 --> 04:02:19,079
Teen Titans, yeah, be tight.

2670
04:02:19,079 --> 04:02:22,200
John Oliver is technically HBO and WB, so.

2671
04:02:23,559 --> 04:02:24,639
I don't want to do that.

2672
04:02:24,639 --> 04:02:25,799
I don't want to say that.

2673
04:02:25,799 --> 04:02:29,440
And I don't want to have a turtle wearing a hat.

2674
04:02:29,440 --> 04:02:30,399
That's pretty good.

2675
04:02:30,399 --> 04:02:31,239
Thank you.

2676
04:02:31,239 --> 04:02:32,079
It's way better than your Batman.

2677
04:02:32,079 --> 04:02:36,780
Thank you.

2678
04:02:37,780 --> 04:02:43,829
I don't know if this worked, but we're going to try it.

2679
04:02:43,829 --> 04:02:44,670
It's fine.

2680
04:02:44,670 --> 04:02:46,520
Okay, let's ride.

2681
04:02:46,520 --> 04:02:48,159
Wondervere is going to hit me up and be like,

2682
04:02:48,159 --> 04:02:50,079
hey, why was 30 minutes of your two hour stream

2683
04:02:50,079 --> 04:02:50,920
technical support?

2684
04:02:50,920 --> 04:02:52,280
Choose your character.

2685
04:02:52,280 --> 04:02:54,049
Uh-huh.

2686
04:02:54,049 --> 04:02:54,889
So are we-

2687
04:02:54,889 --> 04:02:56,209
Do we get like obscenities at the screen?

2688
04:02:56,209 --> 04:02:57,889
Are we doing, are we doing-

2689
04:02:57,889 --> 04:02:59,649
No, they're going to be like, hey,

2690
04:02:59,649 --> 04:03:01,250
we're no longer going to partner with you

2691
04:03:01,250 --> 04:03:03,049
because you got fucking your shit pushed in

2692
04:03:03,049 --> 04:03:04,889
by a political streamer.

2693
04:03:04,889 --> 04:03:06,290
1v1 right now, 1v1 right now.

2694
04:03:06,290 --> 04:03:07,770
Stocks on, real gamers.

2695
04:03:09,049 --> 04:03:10,889
What is stocks?

2696
04:03:10,930 --> 04:03:14,530
Instead of like getting random amounts of points

2697
04:03:14,530 --> 04:03:17,170
based off kills, you have a certain amount of lives.

2698
04:03:17,170 --> 04:03:18,010
Yeah.

2699
04:03:18,010 --> 04:03:21,850
And when the lives are depleted, it's over.

2700
04:03:21,850 --> 04:03:24,409
Oh, there's a list of incoming characters.

2701
04:03:24,409 --> 04:03:25,809
I mean, I don't know how that's done, but sure.

2702
04:03:25,809 --> 04:03:27,579
I'll play it.

2703
04:03:27,579 --> 04:03:30,100
Let's just play it as first and then we'll do it after.

2704
04:03:30,100 --> 04:03:33,319
No, I think this is stocks if you guys want to 1v1.

2705
04:03:33,319 --> 04:03:35,600
Seems like he's a little scared about doing it this round.

2706
04:03:35,600 --> 04:03:37,709
I mean, I'll try it.

2707
04:03:37,709 --> 04:03:40,270
But wait, you do understand that it's a win-win for me

2708
04:03:40,270 --> 04:03:41,110
regardless, right?

2709
04:03:41,110 --> 04:03:41,950
Because like, I'm not a gamer.

2710
04:03:41,989 --> 04:03:42,829
No, I've never played this game.

2711
04:03:42,829 --> 04:03:43,670
They're totally separate.

2712
04:03:43,670 --> 04:03:44,510
I'm not a gamer either.

2713
04:03:44,510 --> 04:03:45,329
I literally stream.

2714
04:03:45,329 --> 04:03:46,170
It literally doesn't matter.

2715
04:03:46,170 --> 04:03:47,790
You played more games on stream than I have in the past year.

2716
04:03:47,790 --> 04:03:49,950
Even if you win, even if you win,

2717
04:03:49,950 --> 04:03:53,190
you owned a 31 year old dude

2718
04:03:53,190 --> 04:03:56,030
whose community blames him for never playing video games.

2719
04:03:56,030 --> 04:03:56,870
Prepare yourself.

2720
04:03:56,870 --> 04:04:00,030
You are hedging every single alternative of you losing

2721
04:04:00,030 --> 04:04:01,670
with a different excuse.

2722
04:04:01,670 --> 04:04:02,510
I mean.

2723
04:04:02,510 --> 04:04:04,430
Sack up and play your best in winner-loose.

2724
04:04:04,430 --> 04:04:05,270
I'm doing that.

2725
04:04:05,270 --> 04:04:06,110
I'm doing that.

2726
04:04:06,110 --> 04:04:07,190
But also, I'm doing that,

2727
04:04:07,190 --> 04:04:09,270
but also I need you to remember

2728
04:04:09,270 --> 04:04:11,670
that like everything I said is true.

2729
04:04:12,350 --> 04:04:14,389
You bailed on your friends going to Korea.

2730
04:04:14,389 --> 04:04:15,290
What?

2731
04:04:15,290 --> 04:04:17,430
I said you bailed on your friends going to Korea.

2732
04:04:17,430 --> 04:04:18,350
Okay.

2733
04:04:18,350 --> 04:04:21,299
Also, that's not true.

2734
04:04:30,319 --> 04:04:31,479
How do you turn off items?

2735
04:04:31,479 --> 04:04:33,719
I turned off hazards, but items are still on.

2736
04:04:34,760 --> 04:04:35,600
Oh God.

2737
04:04:47,500 --> 04:04:49,719
Oh, you just got the credit for that.

2738
04:04:51,979 --> 04:04:52,819
I don't know.

2739
04:04:52,819 --> 04:04:53,659
I can't tell.

2740
04:04:53,659 --> 04:04:55,459
So I'm just throwing myself down to see.

2741
04:05:02,059 --> 04:05:03,700
Thank you for that Moist.

2742
04:05:03,700 --> 04:05:04,540
Yeah, no problem.

2743
04:05:04,540 --> 04:05:05,700
It's definitely not stocks.

2744
04:05:05,700 --> 04:05:07,340
We can just keep track of stocks.

2745
04:05:07,340 --> 04:05:09,340
We can do like a two stock game here.

2746
04:05:22,569 --> 04:05:24,569
Dude, what is happening?

2747
04:05:24,569 --> 04:05:25,930
Can anybody hear me?

2748
04:05:25,930 --> 04:05:26,850
Yeah, yeah.

2749
04:05:26,850 --> 04:05:27,809
Dude, what's going on?

2750
04:05:27,809 --> 04:05:29,129
I got stuck in the void.

2751
04:05:29,129 --> 04:05:31,610
I literally, my face cam is frozen.

2752
04:05:31,610 --> 04:05:32,450
My computer crashed.

2753
04:05:32,450 --> 04:05:37,079
How did that happen?

2754
04:05:37,079 --> 04:05:39,239
Wait, are you just taking free kills now?

2755
04:05:39,239 --> 04:05:41,079
Cause you noticed Jerma's AFK?

2756
04:05:41,079 --> 04:05:41,920
They're irrelevant.

2757
04:05:41,920 --> 04:05:42,760
No.

2758
04:05:42,760 --> 04:05:43,600
What do you mean they're irrelevant?

2759
04:05:43,600 --> 04:05:44,440
I'm here.

2760
04:05:44,440 --> 04:05:46,000
You said we count stocks.

2761
04:05:46,000 --> 04:05:48,920
Wait, so the rules of the game changed all of a sudden?

2762
04:05:48,920 --> 04:05:49,760
Like, I don't understand.

2763
04:05:49,760 --> 04:05:50,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2764
04:05:50,600 --> 04:05:51,719
We're just counting stocks.

2765
04:05:53,360 --> 04:05:54,840
Hello?

2766
04:05:54,840 --> 04:05:55,680
Hey.

2767
04:05:59,520 --> 04:06:02,200
Dude, my webcam is fucked.

2768
04:06:02,200 --> 04:06:05,430
What's going on over there, Jeremy?

2769
04:06:05,430 --> 04:06:06,270
I don't understand.

2770
04:06:06,270 --> 04:06:07,090
So what are we doing right now?

2771
04:06:08,090 --> 04:06:09,930
So right now you're winning.

2772
04:06:09,930 --> 04:06:12,170
So Ludwig's down a stock, you're up a stock.

2773
04:06:12,170 --> 04:06:14,729
Wait, I just watched first set.

2774
04:06:14,729 --> 04:06:17,010
Yeah, but you haven't killed Dasan yet, have you?

2775
04:06:17,010 --> 04:06:17,850
Yeah.

2776
04:06:17,850 --> 04:06:18,690
Oh, you have?

2777
04:06:18,690 --> 04:06:19,530
Oh, that's tight.

2778
04:06:19,530 --> 04:06:22,899
You have?

2779
04:06:22,899 --> 04:06:26,569
Yeah, do it again, do it again.

2780
04:06:26,569 --> 04:06:28,610
Oh, you're so shameless.

2781
04:06:28,610 --> 04:06:29,649
That was good.

2782
04:06:29,649 --> 04:06:31,170
That was good.

2783
04:06:31,170 --> 04:06:32,010
But so was this.

2784
04:06:32,010 --> 04:06:33,649
What the fuck?

2785
04:06:46,079 --> 04:06:46,920
What?

2786
04:06:46,920 --> 04:06:48,319
How?

2787
04:06:48,319 --> 04:06:49,440
No, don't take that.

2788
04:06:50,399 --> 04:06:51,239
What the fuck?

2789
04:06:51,239 --> 04:06:52,079
Honest man.

2790
04:06:52,079 --> 04:06:53,920
Oh, you scumbag.

2791
04:06:57,549 --> 04:06:58,389
Oh my God.

2792
04:07:28,350 --> 04:07:29,389
Here we go.

2793
04:07:31,500 --> 04:07:32,659
Oh God, what the fuck?

2794
04:07:32,659 --> 04:07:35,100
Sorry guys, I had some technical problems.

2795
04:07:35,100 --> 04:07:35,940
My whole computer crashed.

2796
04:07:35,940 --> 04:07:38,299
No, no, no, it's one v one anyway.

2797
04:07:38,299 --> 04:07:39,940
Yeah, yeah, it's just a one v one.

2798
04:07:48,979 --> 04:07:51,260
I'm gonna try to clear all the items myself.

2799
04:07:56,770 --> 04:07:57,610
Shit.

2800
04:07:58,569 --> 04:07:59,409
Oh, fuck.

2801
04:08:05,309 --> 04:08:06,629
The box is breaking.

2802
04:08:06,629 --> 04:08:08,469
Oh shit, no.

2803
04:08:08,469 --> 04:08:09,510
Wait, is that two?

2804
04:08:09,510 --> 04:08:10,350
What are we doing?

2805
04:08:10,350 --> 04:08:11,190
That's two.

2806
04:08:11,190 --> 04:08:12,030
We got one stock left.

2807
04:08:12,030 --> 04:08:15,989
We're doing a three stock game.

2808
04:08:15,989 --> 04:08:17,469
No, Jesus.

2809
04:08:28,010 --> 04:08:28,850
Oh my God.

2810
04:08:28,850 --> 04:08:30,600
That's game.

2811
04:08:30,600 --> 04:08:31,440
That's game.

2812
04:08:31,440 --> 04:08:32,799
Yeah, that's great, great game.

2813
04:08:32,799 --> 04:08:34,120
It's all good.

2814
04:08:34,120 --> 04:08:35,760
Let's play some Tootie Toos.

2815
04:08:35,760 --> 04:08:37,200
Tootie Toos?

2816
04:08:37,200 --> 04:08:38,600
That's another ring out.

2817
04:08:38,600 --> 04:08:40,399
Do you want more or are you done?

2818
04:08:41,700 --> 04:08:45,090
Oh, I'm jumping to my death every time.

2819
04:08:45,090 --> 04:08:46,290
I like this end of the game here

2820
04:08:46,290 --> 04:08:50,129
where you get the Fortnite dome.

2821
04:08:50,129 --> 04:08:51,610
Yeah, it's pretty cool actually.

2822
04:08:51,610 --> 04:08:52,610
I like that a lot.

2823
04:08:52,610 --> 04:08:53,809
There you go, you got one, Lud.

2824
04:08:53,809 --> 04:08:55,290
Good job.

2825
04:08:55,290 --> 04:08:57,739
Let's try again.

2826
04:08:57,739 --> 04:08:59,899
And you had the cheesiest character is fine.

2827
04:08:59,899 --> 04:09:01,739
I mean, it's not a big deal, but like.

2828
04:09:09,489 --> 04:09:10,850
I'm jumping to my death.

2829
04:09:12,290 --> 04:09:13,610
Nice shot.

2830
04:09:13,610 --> 04:09:17,639
I won't let that happen again.

2831
04:09:17,639 --> 04:09:19,760
Is this game similar to Smash Bros, by the way?

2832
04:09:19,760 --> 04:09:21,600
It's like, I've literally never played it.

2833
04:09:21,600 --> 04:09:23,600
Almost a one-on-one clone.

2834
04:09:23,600 --> 04:09:24,719
Okay.

2835
04:09:24,719 --> 04:09:27,040
Should I start, should I play Smash Bros?

2836
04:09:27,040 --> 04:09:28,280
You should, you'd like it.

2837
04:09:28,280 --> 04:09:30,799
Hold on, hold on now.

2838
04:09:30,799 --> 04:09:33,799
Before anybody says anything too drastic here.

2839
04:09:33,799 --> 04:09:36,680
Smash Ultimate, I'm gonna say this right now.

2840
04:09:36,680 --> 04:09:37,920
I have to, I want opinions

2841
04:09:37,920 --> 04:09:39,799
from the people that played a lot of Smash.

2842
04:09:39,799 --> 04:09:44,940
Smash Ultimate has way too much shit on the screen.

2843
04:09:44,940 --> 04:09:45,860
What?

2844
04:09:45,860 --> 04:09:47,059
When you attack somebody,

2845
04:09:47,059 --> 04:09:51,540
it does these like giant particle effect lightning smoke

2846
04:09:51,540 --> 04:09:52,860
on every single move.

2847
04:09:52,860 --> 04:09:55,979
Boys, are you gonna add me to your e-sports team?

2848
04:09:55,979 --> 04:09:58,899
Yeah, I'll recruit you for the Moist e-sports

2849
04:09:58,899 --> 04:10:01,180
multi-versus squad once we pop off.

2850
04:10:01,180 --> 04:10:02,219
Let's fucking go, dude.

2851
04:10:02,219 --> 04:10:03,459
After I destroyed Ludwig,

2852
04:10:03,459 --> 04:10:06,620
who I thought was like a professional at this.

2853
04:10:06,620 --> 04:10:08,579
You were looking pretty clean there for a minute.

2854
04:10:08,579 --> 04:10:09,540
I'm not gonna lie.

2855
04:10:09,540 --> 04:10:11,760
One of the best players, man.

2856
04:10:11,760 --> 04:10:14,139
I'm just saying, I'm just saying.

2857
04:10:14,139 --> 04:10:16,100
I disagree, Jerma.

2858
04:10:16,100 --> 04:10:17,979
I think it's the right, unless you play with items.

2859
04:10:17,979 --> 04:10:20,260
Are you talking about like with items?

2860
04:10:20,260 --> 04:10:22,940
No, I'm just, okay, so you're gonna notice this now

2861
04:10:22,940 --> 04:10:23,780
and you're gonna be like,

2862
04:10:23,780 --> 04:10:25,579
why the fuck did he have to say that?

2863
04:10:25,579 --> 04:10:27,739
When you do like a regular attack

2864
04:10:27,739 --> 04:10:29,500
or a special attack, doesn't matter.

2865
04:10:29,500 --> 04:10:32,739
It creates this gigantic explosion,

2866
04:10:32,739 --> 04:10:36,219
a huge smoke light show explosion

2867
04:10:36,219 --> 04:10:37,700
anytime you touch anybody.

2868
04:10:37,700 --> 04:10:38,739
Anytime you move around,

2869
04:10:38,739 --> 04:10:40,659
there's just like smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.

2870
04:10:40,659 --> 04:10:43,700
It's a ton of particle effects and it messes my head.

2871
04:10:43,700 --> 04:10:44,540
I don't think I've noticed.

2872
04:10:44,540 --> 04:10:45,459
I know there's sparks.

2873
04:10:45,459 --> 04:10:48,020
So like sparks come out when you deliver an attack

2874
04:10:48,020 --> 04:10:49,579
that'll probably kill.

2875
04:10:49,579 --> 04:10:50,819
It's like a really strong attack

2876
04:10:50,819 --> 04:10:53,260
and a high percent of little sparks will come out.

2877
04:10:53,260 --> 04:10:54,340
And run.

2878
04:10:54,340 --> 04:10:57,700
Yeah, like in wave, not wave dashing, dash dancing.

2879
04:10:57,700 --> 04:10:59,579
You get like a little smoke that pops up.

2880
04:10:59,579 --> 04:11:01,700
Hey, I'm not saying that Ultimate's a bad game.

2881
04:11:01,700 --> 04:11:02,899
I think it's a great game.

2882
04:11:02,899 --> 04:11:03,739
I just-

2883
04:11:03,739 --> 04:11:04,579
But if I were to pick my favorite game

2884
04:11:04,579 --> 04:11:08,069
in the world, it'd be multiverses.

2885
04:11:08,069 --> 04:11:10,090
Is your ad still going?

2886
04:11:10,090 --> 04:11:11,579
No.

2887
04:11:11,579 --> 04:11:14,319
Oh. Yeah, I got five minutes.

2888
04:11:14,319 --> 04:11:15,479
Hey, I didn't say anything.

2889
04:11:15,479 --> 04:11:18,040
All I said is that I'm an old person

2890
04:11:18,040 --> 04:11:19,959
and the less stuff on the screen

2891
04:11:19,959 --> 04:11:22,739
that I have to look at, the better.

2892
04:11:22,739 --> 04:11:25,500
Is this a me gap here?

2893
04:11:25,500 --> 04:11:27,020
Oh, waiting for lobby leader.

2894
04:11:27,020 --> 04:11:27,940
Oh, wait.

2895
04:11:27,940 --> 04:11:29,340
No, you're not even in the lobby.

2896
04:11:29,340 --> 04:11:30,219
It's just me.

2897
04:11:30,219 --> 04:11:32,379
For some reason, it's just me and Jerma

2898
04:11:32,379 --> 04:11:34,299
in the lobby right now.

2899
04:11:34,299 --> 04:11:35,899
Yeah, I see it too.

2900
04:11:35,899 --> 04:11:36,739
We should restart it.

2901
04:11:36,739 --> 04:11:37,579
We should restart it.

2902
04:11:37,579 --> 04:11:38,459
We should restart it.

2903
04:11:38,459 --> 04:11:39,860
Hold on.

2904
04:11:39,860 --> 04:11:41,459
I'll do another custom game.

2905
04:11:41,459 --> 04:11:43,020
I'll do another custom game lobby

2906
04:11:43,020 --> 04:11:44,100
and then I'll give it to you.

2907
04:11:44,100 --> 04:11:45,379
I'll hand it off to you.

2908
04:11:45,379 --> 04:11:46,819
Yeah, that's fine.

2909
04:11:46,819 --> 04:11:48,889
Yeah, do that.

2910
04:11:48,889 --> 04:11:52,920
Okay, invited the big moist.

2911
04:11:53,079 --> 04:11:54,879
We still has not accepted my friend requests.

2912
04:11:54,879 --> 04:11:55,840
I'm not cool.

2913
04:11:55,840 --> 04:11:56,520
Aren't I here?

2914
04:11:56,520 --> 04:11:57,520
Oh, there we go.

2915
04:11:57,520 --> 04:11:59,319
I'm air coots 31.

2916
04:11:59,319 --> 04:12:00,280
I know.

2917
04:12:00,280 --> 04:12:01,719
We're friends.

2918
04:12:01,719 --> 04:12:04,059
We're not in the game.

2919
04:12:04,059 --> 04:12:05,260
No, not in real.

2920
04:12:05,260 --> 04:12:06,540
Why did you specify like that?

2921
04:12:06,540 --> 04:12:07,940
Are we now friends in real life?

2922
04:12:07,940 --> 04:12:08,780
No, not anymore.

2923
04:12:08,780 --> 04:12:10,020
But yeah, okay.

2924
04:12:10,020 --> 04:12:10,979
No, it's cool.

2925
04:12:10,979 --> 04:12:11,979
Oh, I've sent you a friend request.

2926
04:12:11,979 --> 04:12:13,139
You have not accepted it.

2927
04:12:13,139 --> 04:12:13,780
That's not true.

2928
04:12:13,780 --> 04:12:14,739
I sent you one.

2929
04:12:14,739 --> 04:12:15,659
You guys call these teams.

2930
04:12:15,659 --> 04:12:17,020
We go with this.

2931
04:12:17,020 --> 04:12:18,020
I'm ready to ride.

2932
04:12:18,020 --> 04:12:18,860
Oh, what the fuck?

2933
04:12:18,860 --> 04:12:20,770
I see it now.

2934
04:12:20,770 --> 04:12:23,139
I'm going to bust out the bugs.

2935
04:12:23,180 --> 04:12:23,860
You want bugs?

2936
04:12:23,860 --> 04:12:24,180
All right.

2937
04:12:24,180 --> 04:12:26,379
Yeah, let's see it.

2938
04:12:26,379 --> 04:12:27,579
I feel like you got a good box.

2939
04:12:27,579 --> 04:12:28,940
Fuck, I forgot to hand it off to you.

2940
04:12:28,940 --> 04:12:30,739
And I just press play.

2941
04:12:30,739 --> 04:12:31,100
God damn.

2942
04:12:31,100 --> 04:12:33,700
Oh, no, no, it's all it's all good.

2943
04:12:33,700 --> 04:12:34,819
Back to lobby, back to lobby here.

2944
04:12:34,819 --> 04:12:35,780
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2945
04:12:35,780 --> 04:12:36,459
The settings are right.

2946
04:12:36,459 --> 04:12:37,100
The settings are right.

2947
04:12:37,100 --> 04:12:37,579
You're good.

2948
04:12:37,579 --> 04:12:38,139
You're good.

2949
04:12:38,139 --> 04:12:44,020
Teams to be to four ring out seven minutes hazards enabled.

2950
04:12:44,020 --> 04:12:47,659
That's good for going to be to I got to play something I know.

2951
04:12:47,659 --> 04:12:49,899
You can play bugs.

2952
04:12:49,899 --> 04:12:51,459
It says you guys are refreshing.

2953
04:12:51,459 --> 04:12:55,739
I exited out and went back to the lobby and I can't start the game again.

2954
04:12:55,739 --> 04:12:56,379
We got to back out.

2955
04:12:56,379 --> 04:12:56,780
We got to back.

2956
04:12:56,780 --> 04:12:59,319
Yeah, no, back out.

2957
04:12:59,319 --> 04:13:00,360
Yeah.

2958
04:13:00,360 --> 04:13:02,319
And now we can boot it up again.

2959
04:13:02,319 --> 04:13:04,479
No, moist is still not backed out.

2960
04:13:04,479 --> 04:13:06,520
But how do how do you back out in this?

2961
04:13:06,520 --> 04:13:08,440
Yeah, how do you back out here?

2962
04:13:08,440 --> 04:13:10,040
Just press the button.

2963
04:13:10,040 --> 04:13:11,520
No, it doesn't work for me.

2964
04:13:11,520 --> 04:13:13,860
Yeah, I think I think we're in here.

2965
04:13:13,860 --> 04:13:14,139
All right.

2966
04:13:14,139 --> 04:13:17,940
Leave Lobby around two.

2967
04:13:17,940 --> 04:13:20,979
OK, we actually might just get booted.

2968
04:13:20,979 --> 04:13:29,739
Probably have Lobby going to restart it.

2969
04:13:29,739 --> 04:13:33,680
Taz is very concerned about how long that was taking.

2970
04:13:33,680 --> 04:13:35,409
There we go.

2971
04:13:35,409 --> 04:13:50,059
OK, inviting, inviting.

2972
04:13:50,059 --> 04:13:52,059
I think I got I got a solid

2973
04:13:52,059 --> 04:13:53,459
another three or four games in me.

2974
04:13:53,459 --> 04:13:55,940
I'll play with German. I'll play with German.

2975
04:13:55,940 --> 04:13:57,719
Wait, what happened?

2976
04:13:57,719 --> 04:13:59,680
We're in. Do you want to do this?

2977
04:13:59,680 --> 04:14:01,120
We're good. Yeah.

2978
04:14:01,120 --> 04:14:04,559
OK, I'm sorry, German.

2979
04:14:04,559 --> 04:14:07,579
Hey, we we had a pretty good run.

2980
04:14:07,579 --> 04:14:12,930
Choose your character.

2981
04:14:12,930 --> 04:14:15,760
Oh, I love that.

2982
04:14:15,760 --> 04:14:17,520
Look at this guy.

2983
04:14:17,520 --> 04:14:20,760
You guys playing canonical friends?

2984
04:14:20,760 --> 04:14:22,600
We both have similar hair color.

2985
04:14:22,600 --> 04:14:23,799
Oh, that's big.

2986
04:14:23,799 --> 04:14:26,120
Yeah, and I am I just I mean,

2987
04:14:26,120 --> 04:14:30,139
the Tasmanian devil is not a dog, but close.

2988
04:14:30,540 --> 04:14:31,540
It's not that you can.

2989
04:14:31,540 --> 04:14:34,420
Oh, it makes sense, I guess, that you can't fucking upgrade.

2990
04:14:34,540 --> 04:14:36,139
Like you level up when you're playing 2v2

2991
04:14:36,139 --> 04:14:38,579
because your friends will let you cheese. Right. Yeah.

2992
04:14:39,780 --> 04:14:41,780
Prepare yourself.

2993
04:14:41,780 --> 04:14:44,299
I really I feel like this would be a crossover episode, though.

2994
04:14:44,700 --> 04:14:46,860
Like Taz would replace Scooby for some reason.

2995
04:14:46,860 --> 04:14:50,059
And it'd be like a really funny door one time and then pop out

2996
04:14:50,059 --> 04:14:52,340
and it'd be Scooby coming back in.

2997
04:14:52,340 --> 04:14:54,500
Oh, the hallway scenes. Yeah.

2998
04:14:54,540 --> 04:14:55,940
They eat a lot, doesn't Taz.

2999
04:14:55,940 --> 04:14:57,420
Taz eats a shitload of food.

3000
04:14:57,420 --> 04:14:59,979
He's perfect for a crossover of a hungry bear.

3001
04:15:03,670 --> 04:15:05,149
Oh, my God.

3002
04:15:05,149 --> 04:15:18,059
Too hard. What's different about this game mode?

3003
04:15:19,250 --> 04:15:22,049
Tasmanian devil is crazy crack. Holy shit.

3004
04:15:22,370 --> 04:15:27,370
Yeah. Taz is kind of scary.

3005
04:15:27,370 --> 04:15:29,569
Watch out. Oh, my. What was that?

3006
04:15:29,569 --> 04:15:48,600
That's the. That was my. Missing me.

3007
04:15:48,600 --> 04:15:51,549
Oh, shit. No.

3008
04:15:51,549 --> 04:15:53,709
Oh, shit. How is yours?

3009
04:15:53,709 --> 04:15:55,389
Wait, what the fuck?

3010
04:15:55,389 --> 04:15:57,780
What just happened?

3011
04:15:57,780 --> 04:16:00,190
Oh, I'm dying. I'm dying.

3012
04:16:00,190 --> 04:16:01,909
You're fine. Not good. We're good. We're good.

3013
04:16:01,909 --> 04:16:05,799
We're good. I'm playing bad.

3014
04:16:05,799 --> 04:16:06,840
It's nice. Nice.

3015
04:16:06,840 --> 04:16:08,959
That was bullshit. That was fucking bullshit.

3016
04:16:12,559 --> 04:16:14,639
Oh, that's that. That's a bunch of baloney.

3017
04:16:15,280 --> 04:16:17,559
It really is. It's absolute baloney. I agree.

3018
04:16:18,440 --> 04:16:22,440
OK. Doing that from off the stage is just oh, it's hard.

3019
04:16:22,440 --> 04:16:24,559
It's horrible to deal with.

3020
04:16:37,329 --> 04:16:41,969
Nice catch. Oh, good tosses on.

3021
04:16:44,950 --> 04:16:47,510
Whoop. Get fucked.

3022
04:16:47,510 --> 04:16:50,909
Get fucked. Oh, that was unbelievable.

3023
04:16:51,590 --> 04:16:53,750
You just destroyed me. That was unbelievable.

3024
04:16:53,750 --> 04:16:58,659
Perfect placement. Stay there.

3025
04:16:58,659 --> 04:17:00,260
Oh, shit. Oh, oh, I'm done.

3026
04:17:00,260 --> 04:17:02,100
Oh, that was in his mind.

3027
04:17:02,100 --> 04:17:05,780
Blue team. Oh, come on, dude.

3028
04:17:07,379 --> 04:17:21,020
Patience on the close game.

3029
04:17:21,020 --> 04:17:23,299
The music at the end is like Batman.

3030
04:17:24,219 --> 04:17:26,620
Oh, my God. I just got Molly walked.

3031
04:17:26,620 --> 04:17:28,979
Yeah, you did. Oh, you did.

3032
04:17:28,979 --> 04:17:31,340
What? Oh, it's all right.

3033
04:17:31,340 --> 04:17:32,860
Let's go. Let's go.

3034
04:17:32,860 --> 04:17:35,540
Good shit. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, shit.

3035
04:17:35,700 --> 04:17:37,500
I thought my down B was about to go.

3036
04:17:37,500 --> 04:17:39,420
Hey, moist these boards, baby.

3037
04:17:39,420 --> 04:17:41,100
That's how we do it.

3038
04:17:41,100 --> 04:17:42,219
That was a clue.

3039
04:17:42,219 --> 04:17:43,459
We're close there, Jerma.

3040
04:17:43,459 --> 04:17:44,979
Yeah, that was a close shit.

3041
04:17:44,979 --> 04:17:47,219
Dude, you had all those KOs, man.

3042
04:17:47,540 --> 04:17:49,819
I got a few, but we didn't take down the goat.

3043
04:17:51,020 --> 04:17:53,260
Tricky. Are you talking about me?

3044
04:17:54,059 --> 04:17:56,100
Yeah, it was the damage.

3045
04:17:56,100 --> 04:17:57,659
But the KOs is the easy part.

3046
04:17:57,659 --> 04:18:00,819
People say that choose your character.

3047
04:18:00,819 --> 04:18:02,379
Bugs kind of nuts.

3048
04:18:02,379 --> 04:18:04,379
That bat is so good.

3049
04:18:04,379 --> 04:18:06,100
The bat has such an insane range.

3050
04:18:06,100 --> 04:18:09,379
What are you doing? You're in a bit of a bit of a bit of a fist thing.

3051
04:18:09,780 --> 04:18:11,659
Oh, yeah. That's pretty good.

3052
04:18:11,659 --> 04:18:13,459
That's hard to break through life.

3053
04:18:13,459 --> 04:18:16,059
Yeah. That shit will stun for a minute.

3054
04:18:16,059 --> 04:18:18,819
I am using too many specials.

3055
04:18:18,819 --> 04:18:21,780
I have no idea how to play like what is that?

3056
04:18:21,780 --> 04:18:23,340
What is the assassin character like?

3057
04:18:23,340 --> 04:18:24,340
How do they?

3058
04:18:24,940 --> 04:18:27,979
I assume they're good at KOs and have a lot of hit moves and are easy to kill.

3059
04:18:28,260 --> 04:18:30,059
It's like, are you?

3060
04:18:30,459 --> 04:18:33,500
Yeah, I don't know. I've just been playing bruiser characters or tanks.

3061
04:18:34,829 --> 04:18:38,190
Also, you know, I didn't know beforehand is when you use your dodge,

3062
04:18:38,190 --> 04:18:40,629
if you use it in succession, it gets worse, right?

3063
04:18:42,219 --> 04:18:44,819
Yeah, you have a little meter underneath your character.

3064
04:18:45,459 --> 04:18:47,700
Oh, I thought it was just when you land on the ground, it's reset.

3065
04:18:48,379 --> 04:18:51,819
Yeah, you deplete it and it gets shorter and shorter and shorter.

3066
04:18:51,819 --> 04:18:53,899
If you go all the way down, that makes sense.

3067
04:18:56,559 --> 04:18:58,639
Which makes it because there's no block, right?

3068
04:18:58,639 --> 04:19:01,159
There's no whole block. Right. Yeah.

3069
04:19:03,979 --> 04:19:06,500
Dude, I was supposed to when I got done with the hashtag ad,

3070
04:19:06,500 --> 04:19:09,500
I was supposed to go back to doing politics because I haven't covered it

3071
04:19:09,860 --> 04:19:13,319
in a while and I just got totally hooked on this.

3072
04:19:14,120 --> 04:19:16,639
Playing video games with friends is great.

3073
04:19:17,239 --> 04:19:18,079
Well, you're not doing that.

3074
04:19:18,079 --> 04:19:22,000
So playing video games with friends plus Ludwig is great.

3075
04:19:23,040 --> 04:19:25,829
I agree. It's good.

3076
04:19:25,829 --> 04:19:27,309
All right, let's go for it.

3077
04:19:27,309 --> 04:19:38,879
Come on for Steven Universe.

3078
04:19:38,879 --> 04:19:40,840
Oh, it's a knee.

3079
04:19:47,940 --> 04:19:49,819
Oh, I didn't even see that coming.

3080
04:19:49,819 --> 04:19:51,700
Great teamwork right there, moist.

3081
04:19:51,700 --> 04:19:53,780
Good work. I saw that.

3082
04:19:53,780 --> 04:19:57,540
Oh, shit. Oh, wow.

3083
04:19:57,540 --> 04:20:03,309
What's kind of going in?

3084
04:20:03,309 --> 04:20:07,069
Oh, well, OK.

3085
04:20:07,270 --> 04:20:08,270
Wait, what?

3086
04:20:08,270 --> 04:20:09,629
Wait, what just happened?

3087
04:20:09,629 --> 04:20:11,190
I had no job.

3088
04:20:11,190 --> 04:20:13,870
No, it literally broke like I jumped.

3089
04:20:13,870 --> 04:20:14,670
And then the game.

3090
04:20:14,670 --> 04:20:17,610
Wait, what is going on right now?

3091
04:20:17,610 --> 04:20:19,010
I did jump.

3092
04:20:19,010 --> 04:20:30,090
My safe didn't get off.

3093
04:20:30,090 --> 04:20:40,260
Yeah. Oh, no.

3094
04:20:40,260 --> 04:20:46,780
Oh, what the fuck?

3095
04:20:46,780 --> 04:20:50,200
Damn it.

3096
04:20:50,200 --> 04:20:54,659
That was big. That was big.

3097
04:20:54,659 --> 04:20:58,000
I don't know what. Oh, fuck.

3098
04:20:58,000 --> 04:21:00,680
OK, I need a hard carry here, Charlie.

3099
04:21:00,680 --> 04:21:02,909
All right. Hold on. I'm coming.

3100
04:21:02,909 --> 04:21:04,790
No, I'm just saying, because I suck.

3101
04:21:04,790 --> 04:21:06,610
No, you're fine.

3102
04:21:06,610 --> 04:21:09,959
I am in trouble here.

3103
04:21:09,959 --> 04:21:13,870
Oh, I thought I lived that.

3104
04:21:13,870 --> 04:21:15,709
How am I still alive?

3105
04:21:15,709 --> 04:21:16,629
How are you alive?

3106
04:21:16,629 --> 04:21:18,829
You're the goat. You're the goat.

3107
04:21:18,989 --> 04:21:20,190
No, that's it's over. Right.

3108
04:21:20,190 --> 04:21:22,469
What? Oh, I missed the bet.

3109
04:21:25,809 --> 04:21:29,889
Dude, not living through that one.

3110
04:21:29,889 --> 04:21:44,510
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

3111
04:21:44,510 --> 04:21:45,510
Oh, no, no, no.

3112
04:21:45,510 --> 04:21:52,260
It's not what I meant to do.

3113
04:21:52,260 --> 04:21:54,620
Oh, you're so slippery.

3114
04:21:54,620 --> 04:22:00,440
Red team.

3115
04:22:00,440 --> 04:22:01,600
Wait, what?

3116
04:22:01,600 --> 04:22:04,780
Missed?

3117
04:22:04,780 --> 04:22:05,739
No, I got it. Oh, my God.

3118
04:22:05,739 --> 04:22:07,829
You're so slippery.

3119
04:22:07,829 --> 04:22:16,049
Me? Mm hmm.

3120
04:22:16,049 --> 04:22:20,489
Oh, that safe came out of nowhere.

3121
04:22:21,979 --> 04:22:27,610
Look, Minecraft Steve.

3122
04:22:27,610 --> 04:22:30,010
Come on, baby. I'm trying to dial in.

3123
04:22:30,809 --> 04:22:34,659
Oh, oh, my God. We can win this.

3124
04:22:34,659 --> 04:22:36,059
Oh, no. Hang in there.

3125
04:22:36,059 --> 04:22:37,819
Oh, I died. I died.

3126
04:22:37,819 --> 04:22:42,510
It's fine. It's fine.

3127
04:22:42,510 --> 04:22:46,829
Dude, what the fuck? That's done.

3128
04:22:46,829 --> 04:22:53,280
Oh, oh, yeah.

3129
04:22:54,770 --> 04:22:57,569
No, you got so lucky, Ludd.

3130
04:22:59,350 --> 04:23:00,829
No, no, it's over.

3131
04:23:00,829 --> 04:23:02,620
We got this.

3132
04:23:02,620 --> 04:23:05,139
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3133
04:23:05,659 --> 04:23:09,659
Wait, no, it was one kick.

3134
04:23:09,659 --> 04:23:12,020
I got it. I got him in the sandwich.

3135
04:23:12,020 --> 04:23:12,860
I got him in the sandwich.

3136
04:23:12,860 --> 04:23:14,739
Jerma, it's a great finish there.

3137
04:23:14,739 --> 04:23:16,459
That was a big sandwich.

3138
04:23:16,459 --> 04:23:18,899
I played so poorly in the beginning.

3139
04:23:18,899 --> 04:23:20,379
I totally cooked this.

3140
04:23:20,379 --> 04:23:22,459
It's fine. No, no, no, no, no.

3141
04:23:22,459 --> 04:23:24,620
I should I shouldn't have risked it.

3142
04:23:24,620 --> 04:23:27,280
I shouldn't have risked it.

3143
04:23:27,280 --> 04:23:30,299
Claw's not strong here, Jerma.

3144
04:23:30,299 --> 04:23:32,340
You staying with Shaggy?

3145
04:23:32,340 --> 04:23:33,500
No, I'm going to switch it up.

3146
04:23:33,500 --> 04:23:35,139
Choose your character.

3147
04:23:35,139 --> 04:23:36,940
I will, too.

3148
04:23:37,020 --> 04:23:42,370
I'll switch it up to iron giant again,

3149
04:23:42,370 --> 04:23:43,889
even though I'm not very good at it.

3150
04:23:43,889 --> 04:23:46,659
I know he's my last game.

3151
04:23:46,659 --> 04:23:47,700
All right, LG, LG.

3152
04:23:47,700 --> 04:23:49,940
All right.

3153
04:23:49,940 --> 04:23:52,059
I got to get some food.

3154
04:23:52,059 --> 04:23:53,459
No, you kind of nutty low key.

3155
04:23:53,459 --> 04:23:56,969
Thank you for this for the marbles.

3156
04:23:56,969 --> 04:23:59,370
Dude, what sucks is Assan's actually good,

3157
04:23:59,370 --> 04:24:02,170
but he's able to be like, no, I'm a political commentator.

3158
04:24:02,170 --> 04:24:04,649
And so losing four times is bad.

3159
04:24:04,649 --> 04:24:06,930
I'm not good. You're actually good.

3160
04:24:06,930 --> 04:24:08,850
You actually seem to be pretty competent.

3161
04:24:08,850 --> 04:24:09,969
And I think you play well.

3162
04:24:09,969 --> 04:24:12,090
The iron giant is cracked out, though.

3163
04:24:12,090 --> 04:24:12,489
This is going to be hard.

3164
04:24:12,489 --> 04:24:15,969
I have no fucking understanding of how this game operates.

3165
04:24:15,969 --> 04:24:18,370
I'm just literally pressing random buttons, bro.

3166
04:24:18,370 --> 04:24:21,010
Your side B's are godlike.

3167
04:24:21,010 --> 04:24:24,379
No side B's have been clutch.

3168
04:24:24,379 --> 04:24:27,059
What is a side B when you kick someone off the map or something?

3169
04:24:27,059 --> 04:24:30,340
You do your omega kicks that swing left and right very far.

3170
04:24:30,340 --> 04:24:32,579
You do it like Superman and Shaggy.

3171
04:24:32,579 --> 04:24:37,549
Old man Jenkins house again.

3172
04:24:37,549 --> 04:24:40,190
This one is like really technical and I don't know how to do it.

3173
04:24:40,190 --> 04:24:44,290
I don't know how to unlock a bunch of the shit.

3174
04:24:44,290 --> 04:24:47,479
It's going to be really hard to tank.

3175
04:24:50,809 --> 04:25:01,940
I don't even remember what Jake does.

3176
04:25:01,940 --> 04:25:07,709
Oh, fuck. I went the wrong way.

3177
04:25:07,709 --> 04:25:09,149
I remember this ups.

3178
04:25:09,149 --> 04:25:14,739
Oh, geez. Oh, he's in trouble.

3179
04:25:14,739 --> 04:25:23,719
Walls open.

3180
04:25:23,719 --> 04:25:32,469
We've got a burly man done.

3181
04:25:32,469 --> 04:25:33,870
Finish that up.

3182
04:25:33,870 --> 04:25:35,629
Oh, I tried. I tried.

3183
04:25:35,629 --> 04:25:36,670
Oh, come on.

3184
04:25:36,670 --> 04:25:37,790
I got to go. I got to go.

3185
04:25:37,790 --> 04:25:39,110
Oh, what the fuck?

3186
04:25:39,110 --> 04:25:44,559
You live that. Oh, God.

3187
04:25:44,559 --> 04:25:47,239
I can't believe I can't believe that hit me.

3188
04:25:47,239 --> 04:25:50,670
Yeah, it was it was in a bad spot.

3189
04:25:50,670 --> 04:25:53,389
It was like right stuffed in on the left side.

3190
04:25:53,989 --> 04:25:55,510
Grabbing this game?

3191
04:25:55,510 --> 04:25:57,510
No, right? No, only this character can.

3192
04:26:01,850 --> 04:26:03,569
Oh, you got me.

3193
04:26:03,569 --> 04:26:06,620
You got me. I was trying to be sneaky.

3194
04:26:09,739 --> 04:26:11,780
Oh, what the fuck?

3195
04:26:11,780 --> 04:26:19,340
Oh, you fucked me up.

3196
04:26:19,340 --> 04:26:21,639
Oh, I'm going to die soon.

3197
04:26:21,639 --> 04:26:22,639
You can't die.

3198
04:26:34,979 --> 04:26:37,420
How are you a lot like a rag doll?

3199
04:26:38,420 --> 04:26:40,700
Oh, match point.

3200
04:26:40,700 --> 04:26:41,940
Red team.

3201
04:26:47,379 --> 04:26:49,870
Oh, that's right.

3202
04:26:49,870 --> 04:26:56,200
Oh, shit.

3203
04:26:56,200 --> 04:26:58,600
Oh, don't you do it.

3204
04:26:58,600 --> 04:27:00,760
Don't you do it.

3205
04:27:00,760 --> 04:27:04,440
Oh, no. What?

3206
04:27:04,440 --> 04:27:11,200
He came out. No.

3207
04:27:11,200 --> 04:27:14,950
Oh, no.

3208
04:27:14,950 --> 04:27:17,190
Oh, finish it up and finish it up.

3209
04:27:17,190 --> 04:27:20,239
I'm trying to grab. I'm trying to grab it.

3210
04:27:20,239 --> 04:27:22,079
Yes. Oh, it's not.

3211
04:27:22,079 --> 04:27:23,360
It's over. Oh, fuck.

3212
04:27:23,360 --> 04:27:25,809
He got out of it. How?

3213
04:27:25,809 --> 04:27:26,850
He's so close.

3214
04:27:26,850 --> 04:27:28,850
Get it. Oh,

3215
04:27:31,690 --> 04:27:33,809
I couldn't get there in time.

3216
04:27:33,809 --> 04:27:35,690
Fuck. Oh, my God.

3217
04:27:35,690 --> 04:27:36,690
Unlucky.

3218
04:27:38,700 --> 04:27:42,100
That right side broke at the worst possible time.

3219
04:27:42,100 --> 04:27:44,420
Oh, dude, the amount of damage.

3220
04:27:44,420 --> 04:27:47,620
Bro, what was I doing?

3221
04:27:47,620 --> 04:27:49,979
Damn, Hassan was stacking on those.

3222
04:27:49,979 --> 04:27:55,700
You just stand still and spin and grab a hundred damage.

3223
04:27:55,700 --> 04:27:57,020
But I don't just kill.

3224
04:27:57,020 --> 04:28:00,139
Yeah, I couldn't finish off Jerma at the end there.

3225
04:28:00,139 --> 04:28:01,940
I got I got towards the end.

3226
04:28:01,940 --> 04:28:03,020
It was so close.

3227
04:28:03,020 --> 04:28:05,420
I was trying to grab him so I can fucking do the toss.

3228
04:28:05,420 --> 04:28:07,420
But it's your it's your job, right, Charlie?

3229
04:28:07,420 --> 04:28:09,659
Because I don't think Iron Giant can even kill.

3230
04:28:09,659 --> 04:28:11,219
I don't know. I don't know anything about Iron Giant.

3231
04:28:11,219 --> 04:28:12,260
I bounced around.

3232
04:28:12,260 --> 04:28:14,659
I bounced up, down, up, down like three times at the end.

3233
04:28:14,659 --> 04:28:17,379
If that roof was any if it was if

3234
04:28:17,379 --> 04:28:20,059
there for any shorter, I would be dead.

3235
04:28:20,059 --> 04:28:21,940
Yeah, the map, the map definitely was a bit.

3236
04:28:21,940 --> 04:28:24,260
It's a bit of a map gap there.

3237
04:28:24,260 --> 04:28:25,780
That was that was awesome. That was a lot of fun.

3238
04:28:25,780 --> 04:28:28,020
All right. Same time next week.

3239
04:28:28,020 --> 04:28:29,500
Yeah. Same time next week, boys.

3240
04:28:29,500 --> 04:28:31,440
Multi versus. Let's go.

3241
04:28:31,440 --> 04:28:35,209
I will grind every single day, eight hours a day.

3242
04:28:35,209 --> 04:28:38,850
Hey, man, maybe maybe next time we 1v1 like you can actually,

3243
04:28:38,850 --> 04:28:41,129
I don't know, be competitive.

3244
04:28:41,129 --> 04:28:45,930
I'm going to lie in bed, eyes wide open, thinking about every single hit

3245
04:28:45,930 --> 04:28:48,489
that happens. He's going to read the what's the

3246
04:28:48,530 --> 04:28:49,770
God damn it. I saw it on Twitter.

3247
04:28:49,770 --> 04:28:54,729
People were reading like the medas or your list to skip it ahead.

3248
04:28:54,729 --> 04:28:57,610
I'm just going to get Andrew Tate's Hustler University course.

3249
04:28:57,610 --> 04:28:59,329
Oh, yeah, baby.

3250
04:28:59,329 --> 04:29:01,850
I'm coming back a top G or I'm not coming back at all.

3251
04:29:02,850 --> 04:29:04,290
That's a wiki, bro.

3252
04:29:04,290 --> 04:29:05,450
I see you guys later.

3253
04:29:05,450 --> 04:29:07,010
A lot of fun. Thanks. Yeah.

3254
04:29:07,010 --> 04:29:08,290
Thank you. A lot of fun.

3255
04:29:08,290 --> 04:29:11,010
This is about the tech errors.

3256
04:29:11,739 --> 04:29:13,180
No, that was that was a lot of fun.

3257
04:29:13,180 --> 04:29:14,680
We should do it again sometime.

3258
04:29:14,680 --> 04:29:17,579
Absolutely. That was good to me.

3259
04:29:17,579 --> 04:29:19,139
Take it easy, guys. Have a good night.

3260
04:29:19,139 --> 04:29:22,870
See you later. That's fun.

3261
04:29:22,870 --> 04:29:26,799
That's fun. That's fun.

3262
04:29:26,799 --> 04:29:28,739
Yeah. So that's multiverses.

3263
04:29:28,739 --> 04:29:31,819
Again, thanks to Warner Brothers Interactive for sponsoring the stream.

3264
04:29:31,819 --> 04:29:33,579
We played it for a long time.

3265
04:29:33,579 --> 04:29:36,540
How long was this? How long was I playing?

3266
04:29:36,540 --> 04:29:40,799
Six hours. Damn.

3267
04:29:40,799 --> 04:29:43,629
Hope you had fun streaming for long enough.

3268
04:29:43,629 --> 04:29:47,870
Hopefully some of you guys got the drop into early access.

3269
04:29:52,040 --> 04:29:58,409
Damn, it feels good sometimes just playing that.

3270
04:29:58,409 --> 04:29:59,530
I'll see you guys later.

3271
04:29:59,530 --> 04:30:04,379
I will see you guys on Friday for Sorcery.

3272
04:30:04,940 --> 04:30:10,280
We're going back to Sorcery this weekend for one million Twitch followers.

3273
04:30:10,520 --> 04:30:13,930
It's one of the first games I ever played on stream.

3274
04:30:13,930 --> 04:30:17,000
Should be a good time to hang out and chill.

3275
04:30:17,000 --> 04:30:18,829
We're going back to Sorcery.

3276
04:30:18,829 --> 04:30:20,510
But those of you that weren't here at the beginning of the stream.

3277
04:30:20,510 --> 04:30:24,700
Yeah, we're going back to Sorcery.

3278
04:30:24,700 --> 04:30:26,940
And then green screen movie night is Sunday.

3279
04:30:28,500 --> 04:30:32,639
So we got some pretty fun stuff coming up this weekend.

3280
04:30:32,639 --> 04:30:34,559
Thank you so much for watching, everybody.

3281
04:30:34,559 --> 04:30:36,870
There was a lot of people here earlier.

3282
04:30:36,870 --> 04:30:39,219
Hopefully it was entertaining.

3283
04:30:39,219 --> 04:30:42,500
It was a really cool opportunity, so I'm glad I was able to do it.

3284
04:30:43,420 --> 04:30:45,500
Thanks again to Warner Brothers Interactive.

3285
04:30:47,139 --> 04:30:49,090
Good night. Goodbye.

3286
04:30:49,090 --> 04:30:54,479
Well, actually, we'll do this to the actual leaving thing.

3287
04:30:58,170 --> 04:31:00,819
Obviously, thanks for the subs.

3288
04:31:00,819 --> 04:31:04,340
I think if they're still playing, go spread out to their channels.

3289
04:31:04,940 --> 04:31:10,500
Obviously, Hassan, Charlie Ludwig.

3290
04:31:10,500 --> 04:31:12,229
I think they're probably going to keep playing.

3291
04:31:12,229 --> 04:31:15,170
Go spread out, go hang out.

3292
04:31:15,170 --> 04:31:17,129
Not going to raid anybody in particular, I don't think.

3293
04:31:21,250 --> 04:31:23,549
I don't have the drop yet. No.

3294
04:31:23,549 --> 04:31:25,500
How much more time do you need?

3295
04:31:25,500 --> 04:31:27,579
How much do you need? Like five minutes, two minutes.

3296
04:31:27,979 --> 04:31:31,469
How much more time for the drop?

3297
04:31:31,469 --> 04:31:34,469
I think there are the streamers that are doing this that have the drop enabled.

3298
04:31:34,469 --> 04:31:38,280
So you can just do it there, too.

3299
04:31:38,280 --> 04:31:46,139
I want just a carry over. Oh, my I'm like a lightning rod right now.

3300
04:31:46,139 --> 04:31:47,500
I just like gaming, man.

3301
04:31:47,500 --> 04:31:50,700
Just playing games and just like, oh, that like kind of bottled up

3302
04:31:51,659 --> 04:31:53,739
gamer energy, you know, you know, you know, I'm talking about, right?

3303
04:31:55,139 --> 04:32:06,540
It feels good. It does carry over.

3304
04:32:06,540 --> 04:32:08,420
You don't need to do it in one go. Oh, there you go.

3305
04:32:08,420 --> 04:32:10,299
So just go watch somebody else that has drops enabled.

3306
04:32:15,190 --> 04:32:17,629
We will absolutely be playing this again.

3307
04:32:17,629 --> 04:32:26,959
There's not a chance I don't do this again.

3308
04:32:26,959 --> 04:32:28,719
You turn 25 during this stream.

3309
04:32:28,719 --> 04:32:30,840
Well, happy birthday. Happy 25th birthday.

3310
04:32:31,739 --> 04:32:42,659
Come on. I just burped. Yeah.

3311
04:32:42,659 --> 04:32:45,780
And we'll see you Friday. Good night. Goodbye.

3312
04:32:46,020 --> 04:32:47,739
Take care of yourselves.

3313
04:32:47,739 --> 04:32:51,360
Call your mother. You know how it works.

3314
04:32:51,360 --> 04:32:51,920
Thanks for watching.

3315
04:32:51,920 --> 04:32:54,479
Thanks for supporting the stream, all the subs, obviously.

3316
04:32:55,590 --> 04:32:57,899
Have a great night. See you later.
