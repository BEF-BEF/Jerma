1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:11,130
Alrighty, how you doing? Welcome back. We're going to continue our journey through

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:22,739
Kare, city blood of traps. Got my tea here. I also have a coffee too from earlier, which gross.

3
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:39,479
He spelled completing wrong. I don't, I don't care. Where? In the tweet? Or here? Because I gotta be

4
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:47,320
honest, in the world of 2022, spelling mistakes no one cares about anymore. They really just don't.

5
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,130
Back in like the 40s, or like the 50s. It's like, oh, you misspelled that on minus five points on

6
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,409
your grade. Who gives a shit? Nobody cares. We all are talking to each other. We all know what we're

7
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:09,159
trying to say. Nobody cares about how you spelled a word right. You're not going to put a red pen

8
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,519
through it and put like, oh, excuse me. You know what I'm saying. We both know what I'm trying to

9
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:29,769
say. Am I going to delete the tweet? No, I'm leaving it. The tweet is staying as is.

10
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:42,620
If we all started not caring, we would make a new language. All right. But okay, I get it. If I,

11
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,739
if I was sending like a formal letter to something, to someone, I would want to make sure it didn't

12
00:01:47,739 --> 00:02:00,069
say like completely. But hey, I'm just in a live stream. It's just me hanging out, tweeted again.

13
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:07,620
Yeah. For those of you that are, have asked about it or wondering about it, the thing that I was

14
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,620
talking about on Thursday has been announced and it's going to be a wild one. Uh, I did not know,

15
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:22,599
I did not know my team until an hour ago. Uh, this is going to be crazy. So myth is putting on

16
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:33,560
a black ops two event and I'm on one of the teams and, uh, I hope I do. Okay. I haven't played call

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:45,990
of duty in like eight years. Go look, go to myth's Twitter and look at the two teams.

18
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:52,710
I am going to be the worst fucking person on this team. I'm actually, I'm actually quite concerned

19
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,590
about it. I'm going to be, I'm going to download black ops two tonight and just play it all night

20
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:06,620
and just try to not embarrass myself in front of like a hundred million people tomorrow practice

21
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:16,819
now. No, I don't, I, I'm not practicing right now. Do you need some coaching help? I might,

22
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:25,110
I may need some pointers. Am I going to stream it? I don't know. I'll, uh, I got to talk to myth

23
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:33,370
and see what the plan is. I'm not a hundred percent sure, but we'll see that 6 PM tomorrow.

24
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:40,539
I believe that's six Pacific and let me check again. Yes. Tomorrow at six Pacific. I believe

25
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:53,849
it will at very least be on myth's channel. I would assume it was redacted. I don't know.

26
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:10,969
I genuinely don't know. I'm being serious. I have no idea. I need to, I look, all I remember from

27
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:21,720
call of duty is so hold hitting shift to sprint and then right clicking and, and then dying.

28
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:29,699
That's the only thing I remember. I don't remember anything else. I remember people just dropping

29
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:37,110
down to prone and then I remember dropping a grenade because I was one of those assholes.

30
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,370
What was that thing called again? Is whenever, every time you died, you dropped a grenade on

31
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:50,730
the ground and people wanted to band from the game. It was like, please ban this from the game.

32
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,410
Get rid of this. It's doesn't need to be in the game. And I would get kills

33
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,740
just because I died near like somebody. Yeah. I was, I was one of those people

34
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,389
and I was one of those people. And at the same time, I also was mad at those people.

35
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:14,790
I had, yeah, martyrdom. I had martyrdom equipped and I would kill somebody with martyrdom

36
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:24,089
and die from it and go, fuck that loser. And I had it equipped. That's my experience.

37
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:40,550
I hope I, I hope I do okay. I'll try. Dude, you're going to be comic relief.

38
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:49,430
Do I just bring a slide whistle to this event tomorrow? I'm going to go 0 and 15, right? I

39
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:56,949
might as well be like, I should make sounds and shit. Like I'm just going to be the jester.

40
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:06,680
Watch me play like crazy though. That would be fun. Happy birthday to my friend, please. Hey,

41
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,120
Montes's friend. Happy birthday. No one else is getting that by the way.

42
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,500
Do what you're good at. You're good at something. Never do it for free.

43
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:29,100
You see, but that's the problem, right? I've told you guys this before and I mean this.

44
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,509
Okay. If I'm, if I'm like the weird clown guy that makes sound effects with his mouth,

45
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,269
that's what I do over here. But if I go into an environment where I'm on a team with people

46
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:48,470
and I, and I'm just like, people are going to be like, shut this fucking guy up.

47
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,970
Shut this guy up. I don't want to hear this guy talking anymore. You know what I mean? Like you,

48
00:06:52,970 --> 00:07:05,480
we can't bring that to somebody else's house, right? Usually that's how I feel. I can't,

49
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,279
right? I have to at least dial it back a little. And I'm not even that I don't do that that often

50
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,199
anyways. Can we give him, I'm going to give him some a little bit of credit. I don't do that

51
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,319
anyways, but I don't want to do that in a lobby with other people that might be streaming

52
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:34,100
and they don't want to hear my horse shit. You need to do it more. Why else would they invite

53
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:42,139
you? Oh, come on. Come on. Like myth is running the event. He's got like a clipboard. He's like,

54
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,740
it's been a bunch of time planning this. And he comes over to our lobby and he's like,

55
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,199
what the fuck, man? Dermot's not making fucking sound effects. What that's what he's doing here.

56
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,829
What? Come on, man. You're supposed to be doing sound effects. No, I'm kidding. It'll be a good

57
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:08,019
time. I'm really looking forward to it. It should be a lot of fun. I'm going to say,

58
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:22,899
I might surprise a lot of you. I really might the wrong discord. It's because you try to seem

59
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:37,750
normal in front of the other streamers. That's not true. No, it's not. It's because you're a vegan

60
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:54,279
furry. Yeah, but I actually think it's going to be a lot of fun. Obviously myth reached out and it

61
00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:04,379
was just cool. That's a really cool dude. Really, really funny guy. So I'm honored to be invited to

62
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,059
the first place. So I'm going to try to bring it my all. I'll bring it what I can. And by the way,

63
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,659
this has just been going in my head the whole time. I've not heard anything else and I'm sitting

64
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:22,100
there going, this sounds weird. It's just cats. It's just in sorcery. Well, now they're not there

65
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:29,820
anymore and you don't hear them. All right. So again, we're going to try to beat part two.

66
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,879
We're going to try. We're going to absolutely get to the end of part two. Sorcery part two today.

67
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:44,809
Black Ops 2 event tomorrow. It's going to be a wild time. I'm going to do my best. And then green

68
00:09:44,809 --> 00:10:00,389
screen part two movie night is on Saturday. Very cool. You guys ready? Cast some sorceries already,

69
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:05,980
man. I'm going. I'm going. I wanted to talk about that. This is a cool event. I'm participating

70
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:14,889
in tomorrow. I'm going to talk about it. All right. So let's let's recap on what happened

71
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:26,179
yesterday. If you remember, for those of you that are vaude Andes, I would watch that first

72
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:33,000
because you're going to get a big spoiler here. We got to the gate, North Gate of Carr, which is

73
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,289
the end of part two. But all these animals are just talking over me. When you get to the end of

74
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:46,090
sorcery part two, if you haven't technically completed the game, it gives you an option,

75
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:52,330
gives you the choice to either just go on and say, fuck it, who cares, or be able to go back

76
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,649
and try to get the rest of the spell lines. And that's what we did. So we are still looking for

77
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:02,570
one more line. And it's down here where we have not been down here at all. We have to somehow

78
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:08,950
make our way from here down to here or make our way from here to here and restart it one more

79
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:16,120
time down here. Are you ready? The last thing we did, we went to the council meeting with Flanker.

80
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:31,779
There's nobody there for the council. Bro, play something normal. Play something normal? What do

81
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:47,899
you mean? We're playing Black Ops 2 tomorrow. That's pretty normal. All right, the docks.

82
00:11:47,899 --> 00:12:01,419
I would call that a pretty normal video game, wouldn't you? No, Call of Duty is not like a...

83
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:07,690
What would you consider a normal game? That's a genuine question. What would you consider

84
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:15,299
a normal game? I played multiverses. Multiverses was a few days ago. Black Ops 3, Destiny 2.

85
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,909
I don't want to play those games. Phosphor 2 is normal. Yeah, what's so abnormal about this?

86
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:28,309
All right, so we're at the docks. You return to the docks. You still need to find somewhere to

87
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:33,500
stay for the night, which if you remember... Oh, it's still nighttime. We haven't gone to bed yet.

88
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:40,250
Sleep in an alley. Sleep by the river. Sleep in the market. Or the meet and cleaver had that

89
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:49,289
musical act. It was there, right? We could head over here. That's where the musicians were.

90
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,330
We met the band down here. We shook their hand and it was like, yeah, come hang out at the

91
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:05,990
meet and cleaver later. So let's do that. All games are normal games. You know what a normal...

92
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:12,710
Okay, an abnormal game would be like... I don't know. How many times can you do a backflip in a

93
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:20,600
row? That's kind of abnormal, right? If we're playing... That's like Mew, who can do more

94
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:33,620
backflips in a row? It's not like a normal game. How many times can you do backflips in a row?

95
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:42,230
I don't know. None? That's just gymnastics. Well, no, that would be abnormal for me to just turn

96
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,669
the camera on and do that. Like, hey guys, I'm going to play how many backflips can I do in a

97
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:48,870
row? It's like, what are you doing? This is like a video game. This is like just a normal game,

98
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:55,940
but like normal rules. That would be abnormal. That would be weird, right? So that's what...

99
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,980
What are you talking about? All right, let's go. Let's go. I'm not talking about abnormal

100
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:07,350
games versus normal games. All right. We're in the meet and cleaver. The meet and cleaver is

101
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,190
a small, grimy place. It looks like it's been converted from a wood store. Rats run across the

102
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,789
floor and the customers at the tables look haggard and tired, as if just smelling the air is draining

103
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:24,539
them. Damn. By the bar, a stooped and hunched innkeeper wipes his beer mugs with a filthy

104
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:34,470
handkerchief. All right, Jerry the musician's over here, which is the person we want to talk to.

105
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:43,379
So, I mean, we're going to go hang out with him, obviously. How many backflips can you actually do?

106
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:50,659
I used to be able to do one. I definitely can't do that anymore. You look for Jira, but eventually

107
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:55,210
it is he who spots you, waving from a particularly dark corner of the inn.

108
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:03,259
Come and sit with us. We've got food to share and company. Sit, but don't eat. Sit. Reject the offer.

109
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:06,820
Why would I reject the offer? This guy's been nothing but kind to me. Why would it be like,

110
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:20,009
no, fuck you. I'm going to sit. Thank you. You follow him to his table and sit down with three

111
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:23,929
others that you recognized from the performance at the fair earlier. Their table is spread with

112
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:31,830
delicacies, fried hill fox feet, curried ball eye beans, and a thin green plant in oil

113
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:41,429
that might be stewed grass. You eat greedily. So, how have you enjoyed your day in Carré?

114
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:46,379
This city is filthy. Jira looks at his friends and they all laugh.

115
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:54,330
It is, but it is no one's fault. Everyone who lives here generates just as much mess as everyone

116
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,440
else. One of the dancers, a tall thin woman with a thoughtful expression says,

117
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:06,039
the problem is the poverty. Everyone is so poor. There's no one poor enough to clean the streets.

118
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:11,899
Jira introduces his friend with a gesture. This is Almira. She's a dancer, but don't let that fool

119
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:19,460
you. She's a thoughtful soul, if ever there was one. Almira nods her head. The only choice is

120
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:26,019
poop water. Yeah, they're pumping poop water from the river and drinking it and pretending it's beer.

121
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:34,600
That's not good. All right, greetings. Almira smiles once and then turns back to her food.

122
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:46,649
Jira crunches on a battered skunk bear toe. So, are you staying here tonight? Yeah, for free. Yeah,

123
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:51,799
I go, yeah. And then I look at him and I kind of cock my head to the side. For free. I just look

124
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:59,100
at this guy. I'm like, for free. The guy's like, come on, man. He nods. You're a brave man. I don't

125
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,529
know many as would risk the beds at the heated reaver or whatever this place is called. The owner

126
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:14,759
makes good rat bone fritters, but he's a few giblets short of a casserole. A few giblets short

127
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:24,359
of a casserole. Where should I stay? The other inn isn't bad, though I hear that Vic tends to scoop

128
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:33,539
up the drunks. He nods meaningfully. Oh, Vic's a friend of mine. Oh, that's what happened. Okay.

129
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:42,059
Yeah, that's what happened last time. Well, then I won't drink. All right, let's get some info.

130
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:49,099
Who is he? Vic? I wouldn't say Vic was a good man to know. Or rather, there's many who know him

131
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:55,480
and wish they didn't. Vic's a bad man. Head of the slave ring and looking to be head of a lot more,

132
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,039
or so I hear. Almir agrees. They say he intends to overrun the council. That's impossible,

133
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:09,269
but if he's planning it, I suspect he has a trick up his sleeve. A kind of trick. I have no idea,

134
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:13,769
but Vic is a very clever man, indeed, and not afraid to work in league with sorceries and the

135
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:21,299
darker arts. Jura tries to lighten the tone, raising a toast with his mug. I need to find

136
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:26,650
a blind beggar. That's what I'm looking for. This is accurate, right? Maybe they know where he is.

137
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:35,430
We're looking for Theda. I need to find a blind beggar, one of the nobles. Jura looks blank.

138
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,539
You might find such a man somewhere in Kaare. You might find a hundred such. Hope you know what

139
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:47,220
your beggar looks like, because otherwise, how would you know you had the right one? It's late.

140
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,259
We should be going. Almir nods and takes his hand. Arm in arm, they bid you farewell and leave the

141
00:18:52,259 --> 00:19:05,960
inn. All right. Am I sleeping here or am I going to go sleep outside somewhere? Do I sleep outside

142
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,900
or sleep in here? I feel like I want to get attacked in here or something. I'm going to

143
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:19,940
get attacked in here. Should I go sleep outside? All right. What is it? How much does it cost? I'm

144
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,099
going to get attacked. All right. You march over to the bar. The innkeeper stands up as straight

145
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:35,240
as he can to greet you. How is trade here? The man peers at you. Trade? This is a docks and I

146
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,420
sell beer. Trade is the same as it's always been. I know the city is supposed to be going to the

147
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,900
dogs and falling apart, but I don't believe it. People are always saying that, but they're still

148
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:56,170
in here most nights drinking their beer. I need food. How much is food? We're out of food, I'm

149
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:02,890
afraid. He points to a group in one corner. Bo's lot ate everything. Musicians. They're always

150
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:09,640
hungry, but good for drinking. Oh, no, I did eat. I already did eat. Never mind. I ate all the food.

151
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm sitting here going, oh man, I'm hungry. I haven't eaten anything all day. Like I just ate.

152
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,299
I literally just ate all their food and I'm looking for more? I'm the problem. I'm one of

153
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:30,859
the musicians. I was part of their group. All right, what about a room? Do you have rooms? The

154
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:39,099
innkeeper nods and smiles a wide, almost wicked smile. We do. Best in Kare, if I say so myself.

155
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:47,769
People who stay here never stay anywhere is good again. Oh, gold pieces. Yeah, that's fucked up.

156
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:54,230
That's a weird way. Why would you? That's weird. That was a weird way to say that.

157
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:13,960
Should I just leave outside? I'm gonna sleep outside. I'm gonna go sleep in the water. Yeah,

158
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,500
I'm out of here. No, I don't know. I was specifically told not to stay here by the musicians.

159
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,490
They literally said don't stay here. He was like, hey, don't sleep there. This place is fucking

160
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:31,579
dump. Don't sleep there. I'm gonna listen to him. I'm not sleeping here. You walk back out to the

161
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:43,160
docks. All right. Back to the dock. You're running out of options. Sleep in an alley,

162
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,440
sit by the river or sleep in the market. All right. I don't know which one. I don't know

163
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,640
what you want to do. First poll of the night. One is sleep in alley, two is sit by the river,

164
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:04,339
and three is sleep in the market. I get to pull up right here. One, two or three. Where we going?

165
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:12,569
One is the alley, two is by the river, and three is in the market. I'm not sleeping in that end.

166
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:30,579
No, fuck that. What do you feel? By the river. By the river? Isn't that like out in the open?

167
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:40,180
I'm just gonna be lying on the beach in the open. Isn't that bad? You really want me to do that?

168
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:50,470
Okay. Carré is a renowned city as thieves and villains and has not earned that reputation for

169
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:57,130
nothing. To sleep outside is to invite disaster. Instead, you seat yourself by the edge of the fat

170
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:03,859
slug-like Fubaji River where the air is by turns fresh and stomach-turningly rancid, both of which

171
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:10,279
should help you to stay awake through the long watches of the night. Oh, I'm not gonna sleep.

172
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:16,519
Hey, you sit watching the river as it creeps past. Today has been a successful day.

173
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,200
You've made progress towards learning the lines of the Northgate spell. After a while, you notice

174
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:32,730
a light on the far bank. Oh, it's because I'm staying. I'm tanking the whole day. That's why.

175
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:39,910
Okay. Let's watch it. It is a lantern. For a while, it moves forward and backwards, then is

176
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:45,849
joined by several more. Voices call to one another. They're looking for escapers, but escaping from

177
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:54,200
what you cannot tell. As dawn breaks, one calls, Vic will be pleased. Clear night tonight. That

178
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:01,240
name again. Glandragor's friend. The men disappear as the sun begins to rise. Your long vigil has

179
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:10,279
left you tired out, but still in one piece. I got the health back. I got the health back.

180
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:25,220
I'm good. I'm good to go. All right, the next morning. As the sun breaks over the rooftops

181
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,099
of Lower Kare, the city looks clean and bright, like a stone polished to a shine by a fast-flowing

182
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:35,180
river. The effect lasts for a beautiful moment, and then the people of Kare begin to stir,

183
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,059
opening their windows to throw out their slop, shouting and cursing at each other as they do so.

184
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:50,329
The word slop. That's one of my favorite words. Can I just tell you? The word slop is just,

185
00:24:50,329 --> 00:25:00,569
it has so much weight behind it. It can be used as an insult. It can be used as a means of

186
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,619
endearment, right? Oh, you're going to serve me this slop? That's not endearment. That's

187
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:16,259
fucking horrible. That's really insulting. It's only as an insult. Oh, hey, yeah. Give me some

188
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:23,299
of that. Imagine calling something slop at a dinner. Dude, what the fuck did you just call

189
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:29,960
my cooking? Oh, so what I have here is I have a pan-seared salmon. Yeah, I'm a big salmon guy.

190
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:38,710
And I have broccolini, very lightly torched to a nice crunch on the outside. Yeah, give me some

191
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:48,579
of that slop. That's so gross sounding. All right, whatever. It's only used as something gross or an

192
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:56,490
insult. Okay, the effect lasts for a beautiful moment, then the people come out. The city is

193
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:04,599
stirring again. Now we're going to head for the bridge. The market traders begin to set up their

194
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:10,279
stalls fighting and threatening each other to get the spots closest to the ships. A few sly types,

195
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:17,980
probably pickpockets, begin to prowl the shadows between the stands. Oh, well, real quick. Should

196
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:24,779
I play that new horror game that just came out? What's it called? Some of the Assistant or

197
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:37,079
something? Yeah, the Mortuary Assistant. Yeah. All right, no spoilers. I'm going to play it.

198
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:47,619
I'll play it like the next stream or two. Yeah. All right, I'll play it. You're going to die

199
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:54,839
playing that. I'll play it. It's really glitchy and buggy. Well, maybe it'll be fixed in the next,

200
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:06,329
like, I don't know. Maybe they'll do a patch for it. Yeah, we'll do that in the next few days.

201
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:11,960
Okay, cool. You can do the next parts of sorcery. Well, here's the thing, right? I want to make sure

202
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,009
that it's not just only sorcery, because it's been pretty much a focus for the last couple of weeks.

203
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:28,119
So we'll break it up. If you want to watch the sorcery stuff, it'll probably be there.

204
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:40,059
There'll be some more stuff in between. So, yeah. Look, I would. I don't care if there's, you know,

205
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:43,019
less viewers here or anything. That's fine. This is one of my favorite games of all time. I'll play

206
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:48,980
this all day, right? That's fine. I get it, too. If you don't want to, like, kind of sit here and,

207
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,900
like, chill, like, have, like, essentially read a book together. I get it. I do. But for those of

208
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:01,980
you that do like it, then we'll keep doing it. But for those of you that don't, then whatever.

209
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:10,950
Maybe we'll see you on the next one. It's all good. I don't care. If there's 5k, 10k, 30k,

210
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:17,289
whatever. People like different shit. That's fine. Let's keep going.

211
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:22,089
The market traders begin to set up their stalls, fighting and threatening each other to get the

212
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:27,670
spots closest to the ships. A few sly types pickpockets. I already read this. I should buy

213
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:37,660
breakfast. You wander the stalls looking for something to eat and find a stand selling

214
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,950
bomba bread for two gold pieces. The smell is quite nourishing. I definitely need it.

215
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:53,529
Ooh. All right. Okay. You buy a slice of the bread. It is pleasantly filling with a sweet,

216
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:58,660
meaty texture. You thank the woman at the stall and head over to the river to wait for the bridge

217
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,329
to be lowered. After a while, a grizzled old man arrives and unlocks a small booth by the harbor

218
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:19,740
bridge. He goes inside and closes the door behind him. Meaty bread? Yeah, it means when you pull it

219
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,950
open, you get the steam that comes out and it's really chunky and, like, fleshy on the inside.

220
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:31,559
I know what they're talking about. All right. Should we go knock on the booth? I'm going to

221
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:37,460
wait. You sit down outside the booth to wait for the man to lower the harbor bridge. After a while,

222
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,900
something happens. The old man leaves his booth and goes over to a contraption on the waterfront.

223
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:49,210
He begins to heave and wind an ancient winch. It seems to be quite hard work. He's trying to move

224
00:29:49,210 --> 00:30:00,490
the whole weight of the bridge single-handedly. Can I go help? Excuse me. Let me help. That's the

225
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:07,880
way that Hannibal Lecter would describe meat. You get to your feet and go over to help the man out.

226
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:19,099
Get off. You'll break it. Okay. Don't help him. You let the man struggle, happy to let him be

227
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:24,859
stubborn. Sweat feeds on his forehead and he heaves and puffs as he works, but eventually the bridge

228
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:30,920
clunks down into place. You salute the man cheerfully and get to your feet. All right.

229
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:39,880
Cross the bridge. You cross the bridge over the Jojube River, which runs like a slime trail through

230
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:52,809
the center of the city. Oh, that's fucking gross. Andy Funny Voices. You said that wrong. Andy Funny

231
00:30:52,809 --> 00:31:00,259
Voices. No, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. I gotta correct you. That's Funny Voice Andy. Andy Funny Voices.

232
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:10,779
You flipped it. You gotta get, come on, you gotta get it right. Funny Voice Andy. Come on. Andy

233
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:15,900
Funny Voices. I love that. That's my favorite comment of the week. That's so, I love that wording.

234
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:22,950
Time that person up for five seconds. You've reached the banks of Uppercare. The buildings

235
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:28,549
here are not as grand as on the south side of the river. They're in much better condition. Fewer

236
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:34,180
people live on this side away from the fields and the hills, but those that do are richer. They are

237
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:39,339
also most likely more dangerous. But of course, it is on this side of the city that the north gate

238
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:48,569
stands. You follow the road away from the river towards the fork in the road. Okay, we need to go

239
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:53,430
down here and I don't know if we can get there from here. I think it's impossible. Maybe it's not.

240
00:31:54,309 --> 00:32:07,079
If we go here and then down, maybe. We'll try it. Yep, the sun is rising over the streets of Uppercare.

241
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:10,680
A few creatures roam this way and that unaware that they have walked these streets in just this

242
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,460
fashion once before. In one corner, a spring bubbles with fresh water. Oh, I remember this.

243
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,170
Drink it. You cup your hand in the water and drink a mouthful. It is fresh and invigorating

244
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:26,259
as though the water was enchanted. Okay, move on. We gotta go down. There we go. All right,

245
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:33,720
let's make our way down to the ruins. Where's the water coming from? I don't ask that question.

246
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,579
We don't ask that question. Got a lot of stamina now. You turn right heading away from the city

247
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:45,539
wall. A sign points towards Fireview Square. You pass large houses that are the aspect of official

248
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:52,150
places of business. One is marked with the clawed fist of a money lender. An elven woman is just

249
00:32:52,150 --> 00:33:01,430
leaving. She looks quite worn out already this early in the morning. You stop the woman with a

250
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:08,710
gesture. She looks up at you in some surprise. Uh, you seem distraught. What's this building?

251
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:14,140
The woman looks at you in some surprise as though she thinks your question must be a joke.

252
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:22,069
It's a money lender. The why they call themselves that I don't know. She gulps back a sob. They've

253
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:33,609
turned you down. They're the worst kind of thieves. What happened? Did they turn you down? She looks

254
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:42,579
at you. Her narrow eyes wide. Oh, stranger. You have no idea. I'll help you. What do you need?

255
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:49,880
She pulls a face. You? Why would you do that? I cannot pay you. I'm sure you can guess. I'm an

256
00:33:49,880 --> 00:34:03,130
adventurer. I help people. Perhaps you can help me. I don't know. What should I say? Well,

257
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:06,730
wait, maybe you know some, I just love the information, right? Perhaps you can help me.

258
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:16,760
I'm new to Kare. Is that so? Then maybe, maybe you'll need a guide. I don't want to guide.

259
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,820
I don't want to guide. I travel alone. I don't want to guide. It's a dangerous city full of traps.

260
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:31,639
A friendly hand wouldn't do you harm, would it? No, no, no, I don't trust anybody. I don't trust a

261
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:47,510
single person. I don't want guys. I don't want to get like clubbed. You know what I mean? It's like,

262
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,190
oh, yeah, come this way down this down this alley. And there's a guy I get fucking clubbed in the

263
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,860
back of the head by some fucking thief. I don't want to do that. That's happened to us like at

264
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:08,900
least once or twice so far. It's like, oh, yeah, I bumped into you and took like three items. All

265
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,980
right. I'll leave it up to you guys. What do you think? Do we want a guide? Do we want someone to

266
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:23,079
travel with us or no? So the poll will be one for yeah. Oh, well, we're doing it.

267
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:31,829
I didn't mean to do that. Very well. She smiles the first true smile you've seen in her face.

268
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:36,789
Very good stranger. I'll be happy to help you if I can for a fee. Where do you want to go? Oh,

269
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:46,840
oh shit. She actually might help. I need to find a beggar in the ruins. She nods. The falling

270
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,090
quarter. That's very easy to find if you can avoid the traps. She nods clearly pleased.

271
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:08,150
Take me there. I'll kill you. Like I pulled a sword out. I'm not going to right now. I got

272
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:15,619
threatened. We can't be this like psycho that starts a car. This has happened. This has happened.

273
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,440
My last place where I remember this is getting halfway through a conversation

274
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,420
and then throwing a rock at someone like, oh, yeah, I'm new in town. I'm the Annalander.

275
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:32,820
What's your name? Oh, I'm the great sage of the of the of the Western ruins. Oh, interesting. Can

276
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:39,079
you help me? Sword comes out sticking to their neck at their neck. Like what? Why start the

277
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:45,079
conversation if you're going to just threaten to kill somebody? Oh, yeah, like I'm enjoying my time.

278
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,920
We're having a good time around this campfire. I'm going to craft a fireball and just lob it

279
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,679
in the air above me and then run. Well, we know I'm going to we're going to do what we did.

280
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:03,980
And how much do you charge? She sizes you up for a moment. Four gold pieces. Half now, half later.

281
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:14,460
That's the way we do this. Half now, half later. I'll give you up. Fine. Half now, half later,

282
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:21,260
you suggest. The woman shrugs. That's fair. She holds out a palm and you give her two gold pieces.

283
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:30,500
She smiles. Very well then. She gestures down the street. Okay. What's your name? Before we begin,

284
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:37,030
tell me your name. You can call me Mesh. She nods. It's good to meet you, stranger. This way.

285
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:42,119
She heads off along the street. I'm telling you, we're going to get clubbed in the head.

286
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:49,130
You feel the round, painful edge of a bowling pin strike the back of your skull.

287
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:55,739
I'm going to get clubbed. The alley gets wider and passing a long building on the left,

288
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:02,539
which seems to be full of children. An orphanage, Mesh tells you, full of ne'er-do-wellers.

289
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:11,579
On the step, a lanky man sits with his eyes firmly closed. Wait, isn't this the area where the people

290
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:23,699
they open their eyes? We gotta get the fuck out of here, right? Yeah, isn't this the group of

291
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:31,989
people that have the fire eyes? Yeah, we're getting out of here. Ignore. Yeah, we got a place to be.

292
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:35,429
We have a guide that's already walking. If we stop, we're going to lose the guide. We're not

293
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:44,920
stopping. We're not stopping for anything, by the way. You're back on the approach to Fireview

294
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,179
Square. You see that? Mesh says, pointing to the monument at the center of the square with a curious

295
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:55,349
gleam in her eye. That's one of the great treasures of Carré. If you step inside,

296
00:38:55,349 --> 00:39:01,050
you're granted a vision of the whole city from above, so you can see where you need to go.

297
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,409
Once again, you stand in the plaza of the red eyes, the heart of this half of the city port.

298
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:10,889
In all directions, roads lead off, some no doubt to the houses of nobles and others directly into

299
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:15,210
danger. On the other side of the square, the main road continues on through a low arch.

300
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:21,880
A thousand other alleyways lead off in all directions into upper Carré. Yeah, we're not

301
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:34,650
sticking around here. Lead on. We're not doing this. Yeah, I'm going to get teleported.

302
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,119
No, we're just going. Lead on. You gesture for your guide to lead the way.

303
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,599
Through here, she says, waving towards the arch at the far side of the square.

304
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:59,429
Right? Here it comes. Here comes the- I'm going to- Are you sure? You ask, surprised by the

305
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:04,760
direction. The woman smiles. Of course I'm sure. Do you want to find the beggar or don't you?

306
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:14,599
I don't know. I don't remember. I don't remember. What is this?

307
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:25,190
I forget what this is. What is this thing? What does this do to you? Follow. You follow your guide

308
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:36,940
through the archway. You follow Miche between the narrow buildings until you reach a fork.

309
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,940
To the left, the road continues towards- Oh, I thought it wanted me to stand in the middle

310
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,559
and get- I don't know. Okay. While the right leads to the shorter street.

311
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:48,679
In the center of the fork is a great bronze statue with some kind of pot at its speed.

312
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:54,179
I remember this. Oh my. Look at how much gold there is. She steps towards the statue.

313
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,860
No, no, no, no. Don't do that. No, no, no. Lead on. Lead on. Don't go over there. Don't go over

314
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:06,219
there. This thing, I made a goblin go try to take money from it and cut the goblin in half.

315
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:10,780
No, no, no, no. Don't. Lead on. Don't. Do not. Let's go, you say, waving to Miche to start walking.

316
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:17,909
Of course, she says. But you can see she's looking at the base of the statue where a pot sits,

317
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:22,699
containing several gold pieces. She begins to head down the road to the right.

318
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:35,190
This way to the beggar. Is she gonna die? Was that a different statue? Oh, but this can't be

319
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:47,429
good either. Follow her. You follow her. But then at the last possible moment, she dives to one side

320
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:54,730
and grabs an armful of gold from the bowl by the statue's foot. That'll teach those moneylenders

321
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:01,059
to not pay out. She cries, stuffing nearly 20 gold pieces into her pocket. Oh, god damn it.

322
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:05,880
From somewhere behind her, there is a noise like thunder of something moving into life.

323
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,320
Put the money back. Put it back. We were just kidding. Yep. Yep. Yep. It was a joke.

324
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:19,000
Look for the noise. I gotta draw the sword. We can't run quickly. Put the money back.

325
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,909
She's an idiot. Leave her. Abandon her. No, this is a new party member.

326
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:34,260
Run, run, run. Pray to the ape. I'm pulling the sword out. You draw your sword, expecting attack.

327
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:41,159
But Miche only laughs. That won't be much good, she says, pointing behind her at the statue.

328
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:47,980
The guardian of the gold, she shouts over the noise of hissing pistons and grating metal as

329
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:54,730
the statue steps forward. Why do you think I led you here? With that, she sticks a single gold

330
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:00,730
piece into your money pouch. The statue comes for the last person to thieve. Good luck. You'll need

331
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:08,460
it. She races away but turns in the mouth of the alleyway to shout something. Here comes the club.

332
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:15,300
Listen. It's got a weak spot on one of the legs, she calls back. And to find the beggar,

333
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:28,119
you need to go to the wasteland, but beware the mill. And she blows you a kiss and rushes away.

334
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:39,909
Well, we did get some info. Oh, am I always left? Okay, you don't have time to be angry.

335
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:45,860
Looking up, you see the statue's right arm sweeping down towards you. Leap left. You jump left,

336
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:55,690
straight into the path of the club. We got clubbed. Actually got fucking clubbed. It just took

337
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:01,449
like 12 minutes to happen. Which sends you flying backwards. Picking yourself up quickly,

338
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:07,210
you see the bronze giant has leapt from its pedestal and is advancing towards you. You adjust

339
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:13,539
the grip on your sword. You rush forward, dodging the statue's stamping foot. But when your blow

340
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:18,179
lands on the metal, it only sends a painful shockwave up your arm and does no damage to

341
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:22,820
the creature at all. The statue's leaning back for another swipe at you. You'll have to find

342
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:29,269
this thing's weak spot, if it has one, or else you do not stand a chance. One of the legs.

343
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,719
In the milliseconds available, you scour the creature for scratches, blemishes,

344
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:43,500
as anything that might suggest a chink in the armoring. Left leg, right? You said one of the

345
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:56,230
legs. Left leg? Left leg. You race forward towards the creature's left leg and spy a small metal

346
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:01,349
plate. Twisting your sword around in your hand, you drive it into the crack and begin to lever

347
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:07,130
the panel open. The giant flails this way and that, trying to shake you loose. But you are determined,

348
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:13,210
and finally the plate flies open. A blast of hot gas ejects from the statue. It sways and then

349
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:22,619
topples face down into the street. I'm alive. You gasp with relief and take a moment to recover

350
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:29,849
your breath. You've survived, but your elven guide has disappeared. Will all the statues money?

351
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:37,000
You see, we don't care about spelling, right? Who cares? It's with all the statues. Who cares?

352
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:41,369
I told you, it's 2022. Nobody gives a shit. I know what you were trying to say. I'll just

353
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:48,980
re-say it. It's fine. I don't care. Who cares? All right. So we've got to go down here. Back to the

354
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:54,900
house. Oh, okay. So we're going to go back to the house of Vlada and then chase the gnome, right?

355
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:07,780
And then go down. Side street. Could we get there from here too? No, we definitely have to go straight

356
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:18,519
down. Uh-huh. You follow the short street towards the building with a sign that says the gambling

357
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:23,420
halls of Vlada. Lots of creatures are going in and the place seems quite busy. There's a short queue

358
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:30,809
to get in. Yeah, we have to go in and we have to chase the gnome out the back. You join the queue

359
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:38,659
and after a few minutes, you are, you are allowed inside. Yeah, guys, I'm, I'm not, I'm not, I don't

360
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:43,860
want to go to the casino. I have to go through the casino. I got to walk through the casino

361
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:50,440
and out the back door. So, I mean, I could, maybe I'll set it up. Maybe I'll put a 20 bucks in a

362
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,559
machine or something and that's fine. I'm just trying to, but I'm not staying here. I'm just

363
00:46:53,559 --> 00:47:04,409
getting, I'm going through it. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So here we go. I'm just walking through. Uh,

364
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:08,440
give her my gold. All right. I'm just, I'm just going to play for one game.

365
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:21,050
Those of you that missed yesterday's stream, this is a casino. Uh, it is the casino in the game. So

366
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:30,579
we're, uh, I, we played yesterday and I did okay, but wait a minute. I got to hold on.

367
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:36,820
Am I going to lose my money? All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta, okay. Look at the tables

368
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:43,530
picking up. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I can't, cause if, cause the gnome, right? No,

369
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:55,420
I don't want to do this. I'll play one game of the high wager. All right. We're going to play the,

370
00:47:56,139 --> 00:48:02,260
we'll do one 10 gold bet and then we're out. Let's go. First the innkeeper. This is one,

371
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:16,300
it's 10 gold. Just one 10 gold bet. No matter. Okay. So I got, let's start with two, two threes.

372
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:26,889
No two. Uh, it's, I have literally everything. I have like a, we'll do one, two, two ones. Okay.

373
00:48:26,889 --> 00:48:36,010
Three ones. That means he has to have to do four ones. Say it. Oh, you are in trouble. That means

374
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:41,559
you call it. There's no way you have three ones. I mean, see, we're just going to play. I'm going

375
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:59,849
to just sweep this guy and then we're going to get out of here. I got two, let's say two threes

376
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:16,059
because that's what I have. No two twos, two. All right. You've got two roof, two fours,

377
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:33,320
three fours. Now he's done. Call it. Thank you. You need 40 gold for that blacksmith sword.

378
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:45,159
I'll be close. Remember you're ruining this guy's family. I am not. It's look, we, that's not what's

379
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:55,590
happening. What do you mean? Why does the four confuse you so much? Because on a regular,

380
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:03,159
on a regular six sided die, the five looks like this. It has that kind of same pattern. So my

381
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:07,940
brain just keeps saying, this is a five because it's got that same, you know, the, in the middle off,

382
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:15,349
you know what I'm saying? It looks like a five on a regular six sided die. Okay. So you only,

383
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:19,690
he only has three guys. So I can really make this, I can put this guy in a lot of trouble.

384
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:37,239
I'm going to say two ones. No two twos. Let's really just ruin it. Two threes. Okay. I'm going

385
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:43,460
to say four. Let's do this because the chances of him having one of these are pretty high. Call it.

386
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:55,050
You definitely have one. You have to have one. Yeah. You definitely have one. Whatever. Oh,

387
00:50:57,909 --> 00:51:10,170
oh really? One? I think there are two twos. Oh, well that's interesting. I think there are three

388
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:22,730
ones. Call it. Yeah. Sorry. That's a, that's a horrible, horrible hand to have against you.

389
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:31,000
You lose. Stupid. I'm just kidding. Damn. That's another good one. All right. So let's do

390
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:52,900
two twos again. Two threes. Fine. Hmm. How many, he has two die, which means he probably has one.

391
00:51:52,900 --> 00:52:01,500
So if I, if I have to call this and it's wrong, right. Okay. So that's assuming that he's saying

392
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:23,980
that he has doubles, which no way. All right. All right. That, that was unlucky. One, three,

393
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:43,559
two threes. Don't call it. Yep. I win. All right. And then we cash out and then we get out of here.

394
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:53,989
Uh, there was one, one, one, one, two. I think that there, there's two twos. Two is probably

395
00:52:53,989 --> 00:53:02,199
the only thing he has. Three twos. I'm sorry, buddy. What? Oh fuck. Wait a minute. I didn't,

396
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:09,050
I didn't know I had two twos. I thought I only had one. I thought I didn't know that was a two.

397
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:16,460
I didn't, my brain just didn't make that a two. I thought I only had one two. I have to call it.

398
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:29,610
Cause I mean, no, I got caught here. I just have to hope he doesn't have it. I could just bluff it,

399
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:35,610
but that's impossible. Cause he'd, he'd have to call it anyways. I got to see if he's bluffing.

400
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:39,849
No, he wasn't. I, that was my fault. I actually didn't, um, realize I had that.

401
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:55,619
All right. What do you got? One, one, one, three. I, I pretty much have guaranteed to win this too.

402
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:58,659
Yeah. I'm guaranteed there's not, when you have one die versus two die, you,

403
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:09,420
it's almost impossible to win. There we go. All right. 10 chips. Change. Get out. I'm done.

404
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:30,389
Cash it out. Cash out. Bang. 26. Okay. So wait, how do, how do I get to the ruins?

405
00:54:30,389 --> 00:54:45,929
Down here and up? Okay. I'm not, I'm not fucking with the statue again. So I have to go,

406
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:59,980
how do I get over there? Could I go up and then this way? Let's find out up and left. I think.

407
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:07,269
Yeah. Uh, leave the square. Yeah. There we go. Okay. Cool. Let's go in the alley.

408
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:12,860
Do you like flour or corn tortillas? Well, that's a very loaded question because it depends on what's

409
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:18,780
in them. Corn tortillas are good for, uh, carne asada. I love like a carne asada and a corn

410
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:27,019
tortilla and fold it up nice and small. Pick it up. Just a flour tortilla is great for burritos.

411
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:31,739
Um, yeah. Okay. You choose a random alleyway on the right hand side of the square and slip

412
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:37,690
into the shadow between the tall buildings. The houses either side are well built and well defended.

413
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:44,409
There are iron railings on the windows and some even have arrow slits and portcullises. One

414
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:50,469
household has a dug, a moat across its front door. Outside one building, a tall man stands with a

415
00:55:50,469 --> 00:56:01,719
grappling hook. Okay. You hang back and watch as he swings his grappling hook twice aiming for one

416
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:08,550
of the windows on the floor above. The hook misses and clatters to the street below and the man curses

417
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:16,070
before gathering up the rope for another try. Approach him. It's Batman. You stride over to

418
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:23,269
the man as he swings his hook once more. Greetings. You begin with a respectful nod. The man turns to

419
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:30,469
you. Stranger, I'm in a terrible fix. The man gathers the rope for another swing. He's clearly

420
00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:40,809
tiring. Uh, what's the problem? I've been locked out. This is my home and I've lost my key but I've

421
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:49,619
got a terrible throw as you can probably see. The man throws again and misses again. Um, where'd you

422
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:55,690
get the grappling hook? How would you believe it? I found it near an old well in the wasteland.

423
00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:10,170
I was wandering about there feeling sorry for myself and I chanced across it. Bullshit. You a

424
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:21,610
thief? Are you a guard? Answer the question. You reply coolly. Listen, if I were a thief,

425
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:26,809
do you not suppose I would be better at getting this accursed thing to land on the sill?

426
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:32,019
To demonstrate his point, he swings again with considerable effort and once more misses,

427
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:37,300
ducking to one side to avoid the look at he as the ducking to avoid the hook as it falls back.

428
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,909
The man gives up. He winds up the rope around his shoulder and then cups his hand to his mouth.

429
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:50,300
Ask me, will you just open the door and let me in? For a moment, nothing happens. Then a bucket of

430
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:59,780
slop is thrown out over the man. He stands dripping in muck. Who is that? You ask from a safe distance

431
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:06,840
away. Take my advice, stranger. Never marry an elephant. They may have lovely eyes. They are

432
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:18,789
thoroughly untrustworthy. He stalks away up the alley. Time for you to move. Well, we failed that,

433
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:32,440
whatever that was. Okay, along the alley. Well, I don't know, the guy's out there with a grappling

434
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,280
hook thrown at random windows. But am I going to trust this guy? Hey, yes, let me see that. I'll do

435
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:41,860
it. And then I go, shoot the grappling hook out into the window, break the window and the guards

436
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:47,539
come and club me in the back of the fucking head. We've seen that song and dance too many times.

437
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:55,179
The street is falling into disrepair around you. Something has blighted this region of the city.

438
00:58:55,179 --> 00:58:59,179
Even the trees and the gardens behind the mansions have turned black where they stand.

439
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:04,659
The only greenery is the moss on the stone walls. There are no rats scurrying underfoot

440
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:10,619
and only spiders roost in the rooftops. You pass a particularly grand house. It's doors locked with

441
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:21,829
a heavy iron chain. Look at it. There is a metal S bolted beneath one gable. Perhaps it's an owner's

442
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:27,369
mark. Perhaps it is there to stop the wall falling out onto the street. There's a ringing noise from

443
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:33,619
down the alley. A hooded creature with a bell around his neck is approaching in shuffling steps.

444
00:59:33,619 --> 00:59:59,320
Oh boy. We could open, we could open the door. Doc? Oh no, I don't have any more. There's always Jig.

445
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:18,630
But we don't know what this is. I could do Sos. Why is it lowercase and uppercase? There's the

446
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:28,780
different spells. So capital D-O-P is open doors, but lowercase D-O-C, like lowercase D is um,

447
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:41,780
a different spell. I don't know. It's a spell. Who knows? Uh, it's either Jig or Sos. Let's do Sos.

448
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:46,469
Or Sap. Sos is probably better. Because what if it's not a danger?

449
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:55,159
Sense danger. You cast a spell and a calm voice enters your mind. It tells you that the house

450
01:00:55,159 --> 01:01:00,599
before you is empty of anything important, even of ghosts, but that the creature approaching is

451
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:10,599
quite deadly and the voice fades away. Um, you want to scurry into the house? I could do another one.

452
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:29,820
You cast the spell pulling out your little flute and playing a merry tune. The figure in the cloak

453
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:37,539
stops suddenly and then in awkward and painful steps begins to dance. The sight is macabre

454
01:01:37,539 --> 01:01:45,079
and cruel. And you hear the creature wheezing with the effort of every movement. Oh no,

455
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:54,730
this is like bad. Keep playing? It said that the creature was deadly. Does that mean that

456
01:01:54,730 --> 01:02:05,210
they were going to attack or they're just actually, I don't know. Keep playing? You show no mercy.

457
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:10,889
Continuing the spell until the creature is quite exhausted, it begins to scream in a human voice

458
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:15,900
from its terrible injuries. When the enchantment finally fades, the creature can barely find the

459
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,940
strength to crawl away. The creature with the bell around its neck passes you without looking

460
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:48,599
up and shuffles away. Okay. But Suss said that the creature was dangerous. Open the door? Do it

461
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:57,690
again. It doesn't cost anything. You cast the spell pulling out your little flute and playing

462
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:02,090
a merry tune. The sound is cheery on the desolate street. Nothing more occurs. Now the creature's

463
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:07,670
gone. Let's go to the house. The door to the house is locked with a heavy padlock chain. You can try

464
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:21,190
to pry it open with the tip of your sword, but achieve nothing. Let's dop it open. Open locks

465
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:30,760
and doors. You cast the spell over the heavy chain and it tumbles to the ground and to the house.

466
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:39,590
You slip through the wide doors into the old empty house, an empty mansion. You push open the doors

467
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:45,050
and step inside the dark house. It is a mansion on a grand scale, larger even than the abandoned

468
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:50,679
house you explored on the lower side of Carré. There are at least three floors and two great

469
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:55,780
doors leading off to wings on either side of the entrance hall. From the back of the house comes

470
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:13,239
a voice. The Lord is not home. I know. That's why I'm here. I know. The figure shambles forward,

471
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:19,880
resolving itself out of the darkness into a tall ogre wearing the livery of a manservant.

472
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:34,099
His eyes are tightly closed. Lord Shinva is not at home. Please leave. Lord Shinva is dead.

473
01:04:34,099 --> 01:04:46,949
Yeah, Sus said there wasn't anybody in here. Lord Shinva is dead, isn't he? Indeed. He will not be

474
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:59,130
returning for some time. Returning? Is he not dead? Not so dead that he might not yet be revived,

475
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:05,659
but I hold out very little hope. My service will continue regardless, of course. As he speaks,

476
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:10,940
you notice a flash of metal from his neck, some kind of collar made of a strange dull colored

477
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:17,559
metal, and the collar is covered up by his shirt. I must now ask you to step outside,

478
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:33,960
gesturing towards the door. Should I just try? What do I do? I don't know. What do I do about it?

479
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:39,460
Push past? Push past the creature. You elbow past the creature, meaning to explore the house.

480
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:44,500
In return, the creature opens his eyes, and a searing red flash burns your arm.

481
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:50,949
I regret to inform you that I am part red-eye. Then he grabs you by the burnt arm and hauls you

482
01:05:50,949 --> 01:05:55,670
out of the house onto the street. The creature with the bell has gone. A narrow alley opens up

483
01:05:55,670 --> 01:06:09,059
to your left, slipping between the buildings. God damn it. That's bullshit. Rewind. Rewind.

484
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:21,179
I can't. Dude, just start killing everybody. No, I can't just kill everybody. Remember Corga?

485
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:38,659
Corga hated us. Um, I'm gonna go down this way, because we didn't explore this. I wonder,

486
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:49,030
I wonder where the beggar would be. Down here, maybe? Who cares about Corga? I don't know. Um,

487
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:57,739
I'll stay on the road. The buildings are thinning out, through a gap between roofs you can make out

488
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:03,539
a tall, crooked steeple some way away, like a finger pointing up towards the heavens. A dark

489
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:11,719
shape sits at its very tip. As you watch, the shape seems to grow wide, then flatten once more,

490
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:17,400
as though it had opened and closed. A bird, perhaps? Or simply a flag, draping downwards

491
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:29,159
in the still air. Okay, we're looking for theta. We need the spell line. Once again, you're

492
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:34,460
emerging from the alley into a wide area of wasteland. Once, this was a busy city district,

493
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:40,519
but now it looks as though a hurricane has leveled it. Nothing stands higher than head height. A few

494
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:46,250
staircases lead to nowhere, and in some places a door still stands. Plants grow from every crevice

495
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:51,139
and crack as though someone had poured green paint over the whole scene. Things are constantly

496
01:07:51,139 --> 01:07:58,070
moving and shuffling between the leaves. The road, such as it is, is quickly smothered by

497
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:03,300
piles of wreckage. There are lots of other ways to pick your way through. One possible route leads

498
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:08,219
up and over the side of a broken down house. Another passes by what might have once been a mill.

499
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:14,579
You would have to climb over the mill wheel to continue this way. We were told to avoid the mill.

500
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:28,840
Didn't somebody say, don't go near the mill? That was the guide, right? Yeah, they said,

501
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:38,359
go to the mill. Did they lie? Yeah, while she was running away she was like, don't go to the mill,

502
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:46,409
you're gonna get fucked up. Something like that. Look at the broken house. The house has been sliced

503
01:08:46,409 --> 01:08:51,420
like a many layered cake, showing the floors that were once inside. Opened rooms have been

504
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,579
stripped of their color by the wind and light, and of their possessions by a decade or more

505
01:08:55,579 --> 01:09:00,439
of scavengers. But there's still hints that this place was once a family home. The hooks in the

506
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:05,319
ceiling above the hearth, the marks notched on a ground floor pillar, that suggest the height of a

507
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:22,550
growing child. Children. Height of growing children. I'm gonna climb the house. Look at the mill.

508
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:28,260
Who would build a mill out here so far from the river? Still, there is a gigantic mill wheel

509
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:33,029
lying on its side in the path. Despite the state that the building next to it is in, the wheel

510
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:41,510
itself seems perfectly intact and has not even lost its perfect circular shape. Um, we were

511
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:54,630
specifically told to avoid the mill. So, um, oh it's a portal trap! That's right! That's right,

512
01:09:54,630 --> 01:10:01,380
a perfect circle on the ground. Climb the broken house. You clamor up the fallen rubble to the

513
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:06,170
roof of the broken building. From here you get a clear view across the rest of the wasteland.

514
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:12,310
It stretches for a mile or two and will take about an hour to cross on foot. And at its far side,

515
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:17,220
a tall iron fence thick with ivy slices across the land. Perhaps to keep the people of the

516
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:23,930
wasteland out, or to keep whatever is beyond the fence in. In the distance you see dark shapes

517
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:28,840
moving across the sky. Climb down the other side of the house. You make your way down the far side

518
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:34,630
of the building and look back onto the path, which soon forks. All right, this is actually

519
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:43,140
really important because I don't know where this with where this person is. Lord Theda is in the

520
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:48,569
ruins. Lord Theda can be found blind and begging in the ruins of the fallen quarter of the city.

521
01:10:48,569 --> 01:11:09,590
He's a beggar. I don't know, just said he's in the ruins. Does anybody, nobody told us where.

522
01:11:21,899 --> 01:11:34,579
He could be anywhere. Let's try right. Okay, you follow the path to the right between broken

523
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:40,569
foundations and cracked streets. On one side a roof sticks half out of a sand dune. On the other,

524
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:45,210
front door lies flat on the ground as though leading to a hidden cellar. Then the path comes

525
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:50,470
to a building that amidst all this destruction is still standing. Its door is closed and its

526
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:57,960
stone walls seem completely intact. You try the door and find that it falls open at the slightest

527
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:08,420
touch. Go in the house. You might be in the house. The house consists of a single room with a large

528
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:15,770
table and a large chair and in the far corner a sealed box. Everything seems in good repair.

529
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:21,880
The wood looks waxed and polished and the hinges on the box are free of rust. Is it a mimic chest?

530
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:26,979
I don't know. From the doorway you stop and look around and that's when you notice the

531
01:12:26,979 --> 01:12:38,789
foot sticking out from under the table. Look at the foot. You go over to look at the foot.

532
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:46,229
It is clawed and a dull shade of gray green. It is about the size of your head and sticks out from

533
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:55,239
under the low table. This house feels dead. Even the air inside seems not to move. Did I just kick

534
01:12:55,239 --> 01:13:02,060
the foot? All right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna fraud the foot. Reaching forward with the walking cane

535
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:12,789
you found in the house. The one opportunity to use the cane is here. I take the cane out and go

536
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:21,449
poke poke. That's the only thing the cane has been used for. Nothing happens. All right, poke it again.

537
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:26,180
Feeling more confident now? You brought it once more. Still nothing. Seems like this creature is

538
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:35,670
either very asleep or very dead. Okay, go for the box. No longer concerned about the creature,

539
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:40,869
you head over to the box and lift the lid. Inside are a series of small round stones.

540
01:13:40,869 --> 01:13:48,619
Carefully carved. Lift out a stone. You pick out one of the stones at random and lift it from the

541
01:13:48,619 --> 01:13:55,750
box. It isn't heavy but it is exquisitely smooth. Not quite round with a dimple at the top and a

542
01:13:55,750 --> 01:14:00,859
deeper pit near the top. In fact, you realize as you turn it over in your hand it is carved in the

543
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:07,500
shape of an apple. Looking in the box you see other carved food stuffs. Apples, bread rolls,

544
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:13,880
goat's cheese, a ham. Each has been almost perfectly chiseled into a shape. This is the

545
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:21,460
kit at the fair. You search through the box hoping to find something of value or else something to

546
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:26,359
explain the purpose of the collection but you discover nothing more. Turning away your eyes

547
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:31,659
fall on the other side of the table where the head of the creature lies. The face is clearly

548
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:39,779
stoned. The eyes are stone. The open mouth is stone. It is a statue of a spin or else it once

549
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:51,699
was a spin. In its hand you see it holds a stone shovel. You peer at the shovel. It is a wide blade.

550
01:14:51,699 --> 01:14:57,510
Good for heavy digging. This creature was a gardener, perhaps or a farmer, or more likely given his

551
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:03,979
lonely outpost near the necropolis, the city gravedigger. But now he is solid stone. Such

552
01:15:03,979 --> 01:15:09,739
things are not impossible. Perhaps he buried a wizard's lover. A day too soon, perhaps.

553
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:18,520
You step back outside into the dying sunlight. Interesting. I wonder what you could do there.

554
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:26,539
You make your way between blasted walls and weed encrusted rubble. There is a constant movement in

555
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:32,420
the corner of your eyes. Rats scurrying to hide under the stones and the cracks. The path turns

556
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:36,899
around a large stone fountain which has toppled over on one side revealing an empty well

557
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:44,840
leading down into the earth. We don't- I don't want to go in the sewer. Move on. I'm not going

558
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:56,810
in the sewer. All right the edge of the wasteland. Did we miss it? Oh hold on. After a while another

559
01:15:56,810 --> 01:16:02,500
path joins this one. Looking back along it you see a toppled steeple. A track climbs the rise at your

560
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:07,829
back towards a low hovel. This is the far end of the wasteland ahead you make out a line of tall

561
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:22,680
dark trees. Okay I'm gonna say the hovel. So hey do all your jokes come from this game? I'd say like

562
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:30,229
maybe 10% of all the jokes I've ever made. Maybe maybe like seven maybe seven percent of everything

563
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:35,479
I've ever said has been directly from the text of this game. No maybe like four percent of everything

564
01:16:35,479 --> 01:16:46,100
I've ever said. Such as? I don't know. I made it up. I don't know. It's not even true. All right you

565
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:51,560
climb the rise towards the hovel. It is merely a tent pitched into clearing. Guy ropes held down

566
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:59,020
by rubble. You stand and hold your breath but you hear nothing from inside. Perhaps it is unoccupied.

567
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:07,800
Certainly it can't contain much. It's going. Aha! Did we find him? You step into the shade of the

568
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:15,460
tiny hovel and your eyes widen. The room inside is lined floor to ceiling with trinkets, knickknacks,

569
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:21,100
brick-a-brack, and other miscellaneous stuff. Some is piled up on the shelves. Some hang from the

570
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:26,819
ceiling. Even more lean against the walls. There are weapons, pottery, jewelry, domestic objects,

571
01:17:26,819 --> 01:17:39,770
magical items, and so on. Oh it's not the right person. Who is this? Sitting cross-legged on the

572
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:44,329
floor in the midst of all this mess is a small bearded gnome who rubs his hands and greets you

573
01:17:44,329 --> 01:18:15,060
as you come in. I have come to rob you. You know what? You know what I'm saying? Should I? I've come

574
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:22,340
to rob you. I've come to rob you. You announce. Amazed that no one has done it already since he

575
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:28,619
lives out here clearly undefended. Very well. As you can see I can't stop you. But you wouldn't

576
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:39,180
rather trade. I'll trade your life for what you own. Trade would be acceptable. Imagine like hey

577
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:45,079
this is a stick-up this is a robbery oh but I mean we could trade too yeah yeah you know that's

578
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:54,470
works I I'm more into that you're right yeah that's acceptable to me taking mercy on the

579
01:18:54,470 --> 01:19:01,060
tiny scrawny creature oh good I'm very glad to hear that as you might imagine he pats the ground

580
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:06,789
beside him let's see if we can do a little bartering as you can probably tell I have no

581
01:19:06,789 --> 01:19:12,979
interest in money the gnome gestures around his little room there's clearly a lot to choose from

582
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:18,340
but the items which stand out are a pot of beeswax a bag of goblin's teeth and a compass

583
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:24,250
whose needle quivers in a direction which is close to but not actually north what would you

584
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:35,220
like no mast I don't want any more teeth what's the compass it's not a normal compass instead

585
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:41,239
it'll point you to where it thinks you need to go I'm afraid it has a mind of its own and it isn't

586
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:47,779
always correct and it probably won't work in the countryside outside of Kare either so I'd understand

587
01:19:47,779 --> 01:20:10,300
if you don't want it um well we're but we're like on our way out of Kare it's Jack Sparrow's compass

588
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:20,840
it's not that's not gonna do anything honestly it's not gonna work I don't need any more teeth

589
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:29,020
I could use the beeswax he said it's not gonna work outside Kare we're at the end of our Kare

590
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:42,199
journey very soon here teeth or we riot you could be lying all right I'll take the compass

591
01:20:42,199 --> 01:20:52,390
sounds intriguing you reply not putting the compass down anything else um do I have beeswax

592
01:20:52,390 --> 01:21:09,350
oh no okay I have beeswax yeah guys I have eight goblin teeth I don't need any more um no that's

593
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:17,300
enough you say standing back all done very good you took one of mine so I've taken one thing of

594
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:23,859
yours I'm very quick you probably didn't notice me doing it good day the gnome gestures towards

595
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:31,770
the door for you to leave wait what did he take what did you take the gnome looks surprised well

596
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:38,010
really I have no idea I'm a kleptomaniac that should be fairly obvious and what's more I couldn't

597
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:42,970
see into your pack when I was taking it could I but I'm very fair and I took exactly the right

598
01:21:42,970 --> 01:22:00,170
amount of things so we're all square what did he take what did he take am I missing something

599
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:14,390
skull cap wig bone sun jewel badge of the noble 26 gold tinderbox walking cane what did I what

600
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:27,289
did he take he took the chain he took the silver chain he took the flute no he took the chain he

601
01:22:27,289 --> 01:22:37,369
took my silver chain a magical silver chain that acts like a snake for a fucking dumb ass broken

602
01:22:38,329 --> 01:22:55,510
I'm attacking this guy give me my stuff I'm sorry that's really quite impossible

603
01:22:55,510 --> 01:23:00,390
I don't know where I put it or what it is you should be pleased with what you stole from me

604
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:04,869
and be on your way oh that's why he's got all this shit because he didn't he doesn't even know what

605
01:23:04,869 --> 01:23:13,500
it is take something I just start grabbing stuff no no no no no no that's not I actually probably

606
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,979
should get out of here because if I take something if I just start grabbing shit he's going to grab

607
01:23:17,979 --> 01:23:23,060
stuff from me and be like well you took something of mine so I took something of yours I wonder if

608
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:33,029
should I just attack him threaten him give me my things or I'll squeeze you to death for a moment

609
01:23:33,029 --> 01:23:41,430
you seem to see something move in the corner of your eye look here I can't help it and in all this

610
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:47,319
talking about it I've gone and stolen something else from you so really I do advise you to just

611
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:54,090
leave kill this might kill him you give into your worst intentions and strangle the gnome where

612
01:23:54,090 --> 01:24:07,210
he stands but with him dead you'll never find your property you search of the you do a search

613
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:12,250
of the hut but nothing turns up while all the time outside the sun is setting eventually you

614
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:17,050
give and you head out of the hubble you return back along the path what the fuck hold on what

615
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:34,789
else did I just strangled him to death what did he take oh he took the wig no I need that

616
01:24:36,659 --> 01:24:42,340
I genuinely need that wig I need it I genuinely need that that's the thing that lets me talk to

617
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:51,109
animals are you not gonna let me rewind that well and by the way why did I put my hands around his

618
01:24:51,109 --> 01:24:58,020
neck I strangled him to death why wouldn't I just kill him with my sword why would I choke him to

619
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:05,819
death and put my bare hands around his neck and squeeze him to wait did I say that I did say that

620
01:25:05,819 --> 01:25:15,880
didn't I give me my things or I'll squeeze you to death why was I in the mood to strangle someone

621
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:22,149
I have swords and magical spells and why I don't need to strangle someone there's no reason for

622
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:31,659
this I have magic I have lightning bolts and I run a poll can I rewind and just fuck this place

623
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:41,989
and literally just not even go in here it's got to be at least 75% yes can I rewind or do we lose

624
01:25:41,989 --> 01:25:59,880
two items for no reason you have to live with my decision it's got to be at least 75% that's what

625
01:26:00,039 --> 01:26:07,699
you get it's a free rewind I know re-winding is I know it's polarizing I know right do you live

626
01:26:07,699 --> 01:26:12,340
with your decisions and just take it as the game goes or do you no no no my finger was still there

627
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:17,300
so I could still do it I think there's an equal amount of both that make the game fun right because

628
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:20,340
there's been a lot of cases where I have not rewound it's like no we gotta fucking live with

629
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:30,390
that it is fun though to play this game uh and you have to live with every decision although

630
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:38,250
it's really hard to win I will say it's very difficult to win the game without doing it all

631
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:48,789
right let's go back uh we're just should I do what I did to get the compass and he takes the

632
01:26:48,789 --> 01:26:57,060
chain right wait wait it might be random though maybe I just don't even do this what is I'm gonna

633
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:13,779
leave I'm not going in here no don't even bother okay uh we're going to the steeple chat's a bunch

634
01:27:13,779 --> 01:27:23,689
of rewind Andes hey by the way we got him this is definitely him you make your way through the

635
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:29,050
wasteland towards the church most of the building is in ruins but a tall steeple still reaches for

636
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:34,920
the sky circling the steeple are two dark shapes that look like enormous birds at the foot of the

637
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:45,659
church a man dressed in rags is curled up asleep look at him you stop and peer down to look at him

638
01:27:45,659 --> 01:27:53,079
could this be theta the blind beggar that you were told to find his face is curiously familiar

639
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:58,300
you've definitely seen it somewhere before since you arrived in care although you have not seen

640
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:07,529
any other beggars as filthy and smelly as this one is this the guy from the very beginning we

641
01:28:07,529 --> 01:28:13,579
could have killed this person from in the beginning thomas yeah well I think we could have actually

642
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:21,720
killed this guy uh let's wake him you reach down and wake him gently at first he doesn't respond

643
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:29,220
and you wonder if you are too late but then he sits up sharply who's there I'm under attack I'm

644
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:36,260
under attack he rubs his eyes then reaches out with a dirty fingertip to your face um all right

645
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:41,420
let's take let's take it let's take it slow one voice andy no sorry it's andy one voice get it

646
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:54,170
right or don't even say it um wait wait okay well should I give him something introduce myself

647
01:28:54,170 --> 01:29:01,189
greetings you say the beggar groans and grumbles what did you wake me for I can see in my dreams

648
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:13,979
you know I maybe that joke from the first game for the first time you played I'd rather stay there

649
01:29:13,979 --> 01:29:25,130
you are theta noble of care do I jump this on him immediately you are theta noble of care

650
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:32,779
you round on the beggar you are theta seventh noble of care are you not the man looks absolutely

651
01:29:32,779 --> 01:29:38,619
terrified by the accusation he begins to curl up around himself and scream it seems quite a

652
01:29:38,619 --> 01:29:45,699
strong reaction then you see he is not looking at you but past you oh shit look up you turn

653
01:29:45,699 --> 01:29:51,460
your attention skywards to see the two dark shapes are hurtling downwards beating wide leathery wings

654
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:57,909
they're the creatures you saw flying around the steeple god cursed harpies they come for me every

655
01:29:57,909 --> 01:30:03,829
time every coin I get every apple every stinking crust of bread they come and they take it from me

656
01:30:03,829 --> 01:30:11,590
what did I do to deserve such torment step in front of the beggar you push the beggar back and

657
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:25,880
stare up into the sky terrifying looking the harpies are screaming down towards him ugly

658
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:30,439
dark-skinned creatures with sharp talons and their arms and legs coming to tear out what's

659
01:30:30,439 --> 01:30:52,789
left of his let's go okay this is important I don't have a pebble shield can I do cats

660
01:30:53,880 --> 01:31:08,010
what would cats do I could do giant giant would help gob we got I got plenty of goblin teeth

661
01:31:08,869 --> 01:31:19,319
I got eight of these let's get a goblin friend you toss a goblin's tooth into the ground and

662
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:24,359
cast the spell a plume of smoke forms and then moment later a goblin warrior stands in front of

663
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:31,260
you the beggar begins to shriek and scrabble back through the dust no what why would it do

664
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:37,060
turn the goblin on the harpies you turn the goblin about to attack the harpies the short

665
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:43,140
creature jumps up and down trying to stab the flying monsters but they cackle and laugh before

666
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:48,500
one finally snatches your little warrior into the air they lift him high well above the ruined

667
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:54,260
steeple then let go thankfully the enchantment that has created him breaks before his body hits

668
01:31:54,260 --> 01:32:10,420
the ground and he simply vanishes in mid-air they're so fucking useless you know what gob

669
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:18,619
is really good to test stuff right you go first sending a goblin into a room and they just get

670
01:32:18,619 --> 01:32:22,539
like instantly killed by a trap and then you just walk around it that's we've done that a few times

671
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:30,569
uh there's such dog shit though this is so bad at everything else all right they come

672
01:32:30,569 --> 01:32:34,170

high in the air I didn't know he was down what it said he was goes high into the air

688
01:35:41,829 --> 01:35:46,789
what's happening demands the beggar but you order him to silence as an opening appears you cut a

689
01:35:46,789 --> 01:35:53,239
side blow the harpy hits the ground it is a huge creature as big as a bear but the savage light in

690
01:35:53,239 --> 01:35:58,229
its eyes has gone dark the beggar darts forward to jab it with his stick but there's no time for

691
01:35:58,229 --> 01:36:03,880
celebration the second creature is already searing down from the sky oh god damn it this is such a

692
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:22,890
this the ape thank god for the ape this one has a much bigger stamina pool I gotta defend yep that

694
01:36:35,239 --> 01:36:41,000
the creature hovers just a little out of reach this is a defense scenario right or just a little bit

695
01:36:41,079 --> 01:36:52,149
like 1.2.0 okay it wheels up and turns about ready to strike look out he's going for your head

696
01:36:52,789 --> 01:37:00,810
eight got him okay now we pull back because he's coming in with like probably like a five or six

697
01:37:01,369 --> 01:37:08,100
I could have done it but sorry I got a bigger stamina pool now it hangs in the air a short way

698
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:19,159
back claws grasping what do you think all in 5.7 got it two come on it's gonna drop down

701
01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:40,739
final turn through the air the harpy barrels over then tumbles striking the side of the church as

702
01:37:40,739 --> 01:37:45,859
it hits the ground a wall collapses and the creature is buried beneath a slide of masonry

703
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:53,000
the beggar cheers it begins to dance all right well I'm glad we got a goblin like just like

704
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,420
snatched up and dropped the beggar creeps out from his hiding place and thanks you two or three

709
01:38:47,779 --> 01:38:53,210
to the sound of you rummaging through your things finally you produce the badge and place it into

710
01:38:53,210 --> 01:39:02,819
his hand he smiles as he accepts it my stranger thank you but he feels over the surface trying

711
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:09,210
to work out the shape then suddenly he drops it as though it were scolding hot that's not mine

712
01:39:10,329 --> 01:39:17,779
not anymore I wish I'd never taken it in the first place I won't take it again he kicks at the badge

713
01:39:17,779 --> 01:39:26,970
and skitters away into the debris of the fallen church talk to him lord theta I'd like to talk

714
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:36,390
to you that is my name I don't deny it I'll talk to you I'll talk to you happily ever since the

715
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:43,770
blindness struck me down I've been tormented by those demons and now they're dead you've saved me

716
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:53,800
or as much as I can be saved that's his cane dude we are ready for this conversation by the way

717
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:58,659

718
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:05,670
here I have something for you you take his outstretched hand and place the walking cane

719
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:13,369
into his grip his fingers find its familiar shape and he leans quickly onto it with a sigh

720
01:40:13,369 --> 01:40:20,090
my old friend this saw me through the worst times when my eyes were failing I hardly need it now of

721
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:26,140
course to demonstrate he spins around on the spot gets his legs into a tangle and sits down

722
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:36,739
sharply laughing but thank you stranger you are indeed kind the beggar shivers against a sudden

723
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:43,350
breath of cold the afternoon is waning evening is approaching already days are growing shorter

724
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:52,100
it's like that here near the backlands tell me your spell line for the gate just cut right to

725
01:40:52,100 --> 01:41:07,689
the chase that was a willy wonka moment tell me your spell line for the gate please happily

726
01:41:07,689 --> 01:41:17,380
I'm glad to be rid of it it was uh no my memory is not as good as it was let me see it was uh

727
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:27,529

730
01:41:53,529 --> 01:42:01,020
remember the rest of the line he shakes his head it's gone I fear it's gone like my sight

731
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:07,260
it was the name of a god one of the old gods the god of pride no less and maybe you can find out

732
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:13,770
elsewhere you could ask corga the god of grace for his health he lives in a temple that way

733
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:30,199
he waves roughly northwards shit corga is not going to be happy that you killed the gnome

734
01:42:30,199 --> 01:42:41,130
wait I did does that still count that doesn't still count right I have I killed anybody no be

735
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:45,899
let's be honest I strangled a gnome I did I strangled the gnome with my bare hands and then

736
01:42:45,899 --> 01:42:50,600
cut off his wimp height until he died but we rewound that have I killed anybody in this play

737

739
01:43:23,079 --> 01:43:35,750

740
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:44,579
we'll hold on we'll see at the end of this conversation tell me the order of the lines

741
01:43:44,579 --> 01:43:51,539
the order of the spell lines do you know it no no idea although I know my line came first

742
01:43:51,539 --> 01:43:59,850
okay tell me about corga corga sees all and knows all suddenly the beggar grips your wrist

743
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:05,210
and squeezes what you risk your life if you talk to him remember please the left eye that's how

744
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:13,180
you start the left eye what happened to your eyes you take a moment to show some sympathy what

745
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:21,800
happened to your eyes a black eye curse and I know who cursed me it was sansis once he was a good

746
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:28,470
ruler fair and honest he ruled kare like a kind father looking after a cherished daughter nothing

747
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:34,199
was too much effort but he began to fear his other counselors he thought we were plotting against

748
01:44:34,199 --> 01:44:43,800
him ready to overthrow him were you mulas was as soon as sansis gave mulas one of the spell lines

749
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:50,869
he wanted them all he wanted them for himself if he could hold the city to ransom mulas used to

750
01:44:50,869 --> 01:45:02,899
be a blackmailer while I was loyal and sansis repaid me like this he was weeping you curse the

751
01:45:02,899 --> 01:45:07,899
beggar for his useless half-help then you look to the track ahead and take your leave of him

752
01:45:07,899 --> 01:45:19,420
your clues have been updated god damn it I just needed to have food where can I get food I need

to find out who the god of pride is shit oh no is it can we get it here corga no corga's not the

760
01:47:21,899 --> 01:47:41,609
dead noble in the crypt uh let's try that let's try that over here right the fence is a slang

761
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:52,020
shit fuck doesn't know damn it we're so close I need literally one word to complete it I've

762
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:59,859
I've never completed this the path ends at a tall and ancient iron fence overgrown with weeds

763
01:47:59,859 --> 01:48:05,369
through the dense leaves you can make out a wide area dotted with stones and small buildings and

764
01:48:05,369 --> 01:48:13,460
straight somber trees it's an acropolis of mausoleums and tombs slang's the god of malice

765
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:26,869
maybe check the tombstones yeah that's right there are nobles buried here all right I'm

766
01:48:26,869 --> 01:48:38,229
gonna uh let's cast spill wait I look at my health try the sewers what is big big is one

767
01:48:38,229 --> 01:48:56,550
stamina is anything free zip it's not free what parts do you have I have everything besides the

768
01:48:56,550 --> 01:49:10,279
name of the god of pride that's the only thing I don't know uh hopefully this doesn't kill me

769
01:49:10,279 --> 01:49:18,069
I'm gonna climb it you test the ivy seems tightly wound about the railings wedging one toe between

770
01:49:18,069 --> 01:49:23,189
the metal bars you grip the cords of the plant and haul your way up and the second foot is up

771
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:31,859
and you are climbing so you can feel the plant tearing under your hands keep on ow you keep

772
01:49:31,859 --> 01:49:36,500
going hoping that if you move quickly you will clear the fence before the ivy comes away you

773
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:41,140
don't manage it near the very top you feel the sap leaking between your fingers as the cords of the

774
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:47,430
plant snap then you fall painfully back onto the rubble strewn ground however all is not lost where

775
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:52,760
the plant has torn away from the fence a foxhole has been revealed leading underneath the fence

776
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:56,840
something a rat perhaps scurries through the fence and back into the wasteland

777
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:05,449
all right we're going to the hole you kneel down and wriggle your way into the foxhole

778
01:50:05,449 --> 01:50:09,689
it is so narrow that you have to keep your arms out in front of you and drag your pack along

779
01:50:09,689 --> 01:50:14,729
behind but thankfully it is short coming up on the other side of the fence less than two strides

780
01:50:14,729 --> 01:50:22,300
away you pull yourself up from a hole in the ground into the graveyard all right where's the

781
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:26,380
i need food i need to heal do i have do i have nothing

783
01:50:49,319 --> 01:50:55,699
standing up and saying um i'm going to destroy you how dare you take a life of somebody i'm going to

784
01:50:55,699 --> 01:51:03,619
kill you how dare you okay you're once again standing in the city necropolis in the shadow

785
01:51:03,619 --> 01:51:11,270
of the ewes and gravestones okay the sun is setting behind the wall look around the gravestones is

786
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:15,880
there anything we didn't get here you step nervously off the path and walk between the

787
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:21,399
nearest tombs somewhere ancient headstones tilt to the crazy angles others are fresh neatly carved

788

791
01:52:03,609 --> 01:52:08,649
are two ways to get the final part of the spell line the second way is a bit eccentric

792
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:20,979
i love how you put that that's great it's a little eccentric go to corga you don't need

trees along a narrowing track until you reach a fork in the road to the left the track gets narrower

808

822
01:57:08,069 --> 01:57:19,289

823
01:57:19,289 --> 01:57:28,920
not let's do that before i um before i get out of here uh let's create a new spell for people that

824
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:33,479
didn't see yesterday's dream i'm sorry i'm kind of blowing through this but uh we did already do

825
01:57:33,479 --> 01:57:38,680
all of this very slowly and very methodically so um if you haven't caught up yet i suggest you do

826
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:48,920
look to the stars you're a mage and not a mere sorcerer who knows what spell you could weave

827
01:57:48,920 --> 01:58:01,239
at a spot like this it's the best place in the city let's try to make a new spell we did purr

828
01:58:01,239 --> 01:58:14,920
last time which is summon a thousand cats tack is really good tar uh puke puke exists

829
01:58:16,439 --> 01:58:21,479
luck i'm imagining luck is probably a good one too black is really good i think we can just

830
01:58:21,479 --> 01:58:37,300
create whatever do tack tack what's litter luck lure tack is the best you should do tack please

831
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:46,409
tack all right let's do tack you fashion the stars into alignment and an enchantment is created

832
01:58:46,489 --> 01:58:52,329
you feel a tingling sensation in your wrist and you look down to see flashing sparks in your palm

833
01:58:52,329 --> 01:59:02,520
that flicker different colors for a moment gold then white then black um close my fist

834
01:59:06,779 --> 01:59:11,899
you flex your fingers ready to grip the sparks which begin to flash faster and faster perhaps

835
01:59:11,899 --> 01:59:18,779
the shade of the spark is important will you grab a certain color or trust to chance i don't know

836
01:59:19,779 --> 01:59:45,109
gold just grab gold black is gold gonna give me money just grab gigachad um i need to pull

837
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:57,140
because i i genuinely don't know which one of these i'm gonna do uh one two or three i could

838
01:59:57,140 --> 02:00:07,659
not make a decision if i wanted to yeah one is uh wait for the black spark two is wait for the

839
02:00:07,659 --> 02:00:28,899
gold spark three is just grab whatever it looks like it's gonna be just grab so you want me just

840
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:40,260
to close my eyes and just gigachad who cares okay why would you guys do this right this is

841
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:50,180
not my decision so if i explode when i do this then it's not my fault all right just grab you

842
02:00:50,180 --> 02:00:54,659
have no way of knowing the spell how the spell will last so you waste no time you close your

843
02:00:54,659 --> 02:01:00,340
fist tight the sparks are hot in your palm but the pain fades quickly and when you reopen your fist

844
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:07,000
you found that you are now holding a wooden face mask of black wood the sparks in the spell

845
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,569
itself are gone you found one of the secret spells of the temple of corga the icy wind

846
02:01:12,569 --> 02:01:29,000
chills you to the bone that is a new spell that i can do that's fear right where is it it's gack

02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:33,189

857
02:03:53,289 --> 02:04:00,390
uh up there steal something yeah fuck this place the temple is cluttered with so many valuable

858
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:05,930
artifacts it is hard to decide where to begin there are sculptures plates candlesticks and

859
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:12,119
shields of solid gold a table covered with a silk cloth holds a crystal decanter and four

860
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:18,329
golden goblets in another corner a fountain showers with an endless stream of diamonds and jewels

861
02:04:18,329 --> 02:04:24,119
take a handful of fucking jewels you go over to the fountain gazing in wonderment at the

862
02:04:24,119 --> 02:04:29,460
sparkling splendor that issues from its spout you could simply put your pack underneath the stream

863
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:34,659
open and make enough money to hire an army to take with you to mampang you take a fistful of

864
02:04:34,659 --> 02:04:39,460
the jewels but then you freeze the humming sound in the temple has become louder and you have a

865
02:04:39,460 --> 02:04:46,550
strong sense that something is watching you turn around and look you turn your gaze up and see

866
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:52,250
nothing but wait a moment weren't there four stone demons up in the rafters above the altar before

867
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:58,470
the gargoyles are flapping in the air above you they are still stone but now their jaws are working

868
02:04:58,470 --> 02:05:04,250
and their teeth snap in the air in front of their faces you begin to ready a spell but the creatures

869
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:10,100
know a sorcerer when they see one in moments one has dived for your right arm and with a single

870
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:17,340
bite severs it clean away what you look down in horror you will not be able to cast any more

871
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:22,949
spells now or wield your sword well the gargoyles hover back a little perhaps hoping that the

872
02:05:22,949 --> 02:05:38,090
punishment has been suitably severe i can never cast the spell ever again that sucks um we we

873
02:05:38,090 --> 02:05:46,470
ain't living with that i know i'm just i'm a cheating andy so bad right now whatever whatever

874
02:05:46,470 --> 02:05:59,939
whatever i don't care i don't care whatever it's fine what else can i do here should i just zap

875
02:05:59,939 --> 02:06:18,859
the statue should i just cast lightning and put it directly into corgis head it's three stamina

876
02:06:18,859 --> 02:06:47,979
though that's bad do hot and just burn this place down um doesn't matter i mean i i'm trying to get

877
02:06:47,979 --> 02:06:57,850
to the sewer because the sewer is where we can apparently figure out this last word maybe all

878
02:06:57,850 --> 02:07:06,899
right i'm just walking across let's go nonsense and superstition you stride across the carpet

879
02:07:06,899 --> 02:07:11,479
towards the idol but along the way something happens although you cannot be sure of what

880
02:07:11,479 --> 02:07:18,260
one moment you are in the temple of corga and the next you are in the sewer this is where we want

881
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:32,460
to be let's find this goddamn line you've landed in a disgusting pile of unbelievable filth slime

882
02:07:32,539 --> 02:07:38,779
excrement sludge dung and dregs all the way up to your neck you are evidently in the sewers of

883
02:07:38,779 --> 02:07:48,489
kare wait you wait a moment as a nearby chute ejects a torrent of filth and pig swill then

884
02:07:48,489 --> 02:07:54,359
you get yourself to your feet and wipe off the sludge as best you can oh we just got elden ringed

885
02:07:54,359 --> 02:08:08,229
by the way where am i you stand in a cavernous sewer tunnel filled knee deep with slow flowing

886
02:08:08,229 --> 02:08:15,659
stench filled water it is pitch black you could be standing on a mountaintop or inside of a coffin

887
02:08:15,659 --> 02:08:24,699
except that is for a single speck of light somewhere in the far distance you wait and

888
02:08:24,699 --> 02:08:31,319
within a few moments the tunnel is filled with goblins there are not one or two but a whole army

889
02:08:31,319 --> 02:08:38,310
led by a tall stocky elder goblin enchanting a weird guttural song they pause a short distance

890
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:45,750
away from you and the leader steps forward you should not be here this is the domain of the mad

891
02:08:46,229 --> 02:09:16,220
king end of us fuck you gack or god damn it i could be the new god uh hot that's too much stamina

892
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:24,600
though i need to i need to do the things that are not stamina gack would work pop would work

893
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:33,420
i don't have any pebbles though uh god would work but that's stamina i think gack is good

894
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:44,699
let's try it it doesn't cost any stamina gack you cast the spell whipping out the black face mask

895
02:09:44,699 --> 02:09:51,500
the goblins shake and quiver with fear you are clearly a powerful being we will not trouble you

896
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:58,180
and with that he waves his army on they march off into the tunnel jeer at them you call and

897
02:09:58,180 --> 02:10:05,079
jeer at the goblins as they pass but they are well trained even the grunts at the back ignore you

898
02:10:05,079 --> 02:10:12,840
at the rear are two goblin generals how many more soldiers does the mad king want thousands

899
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:21,420
they don't get what he gets that he will the two walk on still talking in muttering voices like

900
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:31,779
this one didn't see that there were no quotes the goblins are tramping away up the sewer all right

901
02:10:31,779 --> 02:10:41,510
head the other way follow the goblins i mean what does this go this goes down here potentially up

902
02:10:42,069 --> 02:10:49,140
this goes up and potentially over here i'm going to follow them with the face mask on and just be

903
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:53,899
like

904
02:11:06,329 --> 02:11:10,789
jim carrey from yeah i'm gonna be running around that's exactly what i was thinking of

905
02:11:10,789 --> 02:11:16,069
do you know what i was holy shit that person you that i didn't even say it but that was exactly

906
02:11:16,069 --> 02:11:21,960
what was in my mind jim carrey from the mask when he's in the office and he's holding it up to his

907
02:11:22,039 --> 02:11:24,659
face and it doesn't work and he's just going like

908
02:11:27,619 --> 02:11:31,300
he's making all these noises and jumping around that is what i was just doing as well that was

909
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:36,579
in my head i just didn't say it i didn't know how many people were going to understand that

910
02:11:40,649 --> 02:11:54,979
that was the sweetest chef hey is the mask in the library of congress is it because it better be

911
02:11:54,979 --> 02:12:01,899
that's like has to be right can somebody look that up is is jim carries the mask in the library of

912
02:12:01,899 --> 02:12:14,649
congress if why no not the mask itself like the movie prop i'm talking about the the movie

913
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:29,460
like people in congress like want to go look at it yeah if this one movie somebody said it if

914
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:33,779
there's somebody said they shot it into space if there's one movie they should shoot into space

915
02:12:33,779 --> 02:12:44,119
it's the mask just confuse the fuck out of all the aliens there's only jim carries the mask and

916
02:12:45,159 --> 02:12:53,340
and a wheel we're like a car tire like what the hell is going on with what what is this

917
02:12:53,340 --> 02:13:02,939
just that would be crazy right what the fuck even is this thing a car tire with the hubcap on

918
02:13:02,939 --> 02:13:09,289
that's all of our inventions oh we found this strange thing siya look what we found we pulled

919
02:13:09,289 --> 02:13:16,819
it into the beam it's a wheel that's what they put in their uh the thing in their time capsule

920
02:13:16,819 --> 02:13:23,590
a fucking wheel at the jim carrey movie well we aren't going there they would never no we

921
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:29,720
would never get invaded we would never be invaded why would you invade this place why would you ever

922
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:36,439
care no no no we can just skip that planet they just they sent out a wheel and a jim carrey movie

923
02:13:36,439 --> 02:13:42,659
we don't have to worry about that place don't shoot any interesting technology there right it's

924
02:13:42,659 --> 02:13:50,279
like oh man we should share our technology are you kidding me don't send an iphone up there

925
02:13:50,279 --> 02:14:06,760
send a burnt torch and a wheel they're going to skip our planet that's isolationist would you

926
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:10,840
want the aliens to know the technology that we have i don't want oh yeah let's make sure the

927
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:25,960
satellite communicates no all right anyways where were we um it's not did uh jim carrey the mask is

928
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:40,199
not in the library of congress but shrek is yeah i don't put i send up like a stick with a like a

929
02:14:40,199 --> 02:14:48,869
cloth wrapping around it and like a shark tooth on it look yes tools we have tool we tool oh poor

930
02:14:48,869 --> 02:15:06,710
earth no no no no no no we just leave them okay here we go send up a stick yeah the fact

931
02:15:06,710 --> 02:15:12,550
the fact that it would be in a rocket ship means we have the technology to have a rocket ship

932
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:20,069
communicate in the first place that would be even more bizarre right why we're not fooling anybody

933
02:15:20,069 --> 02:15:25,529
why would they put this in the we have rocket fuel but they're showing us that they have primitive

934
02:15:25,529 --> 02:15:39,510
tools that's stupid uh yeah never mind what i said was dumb we have the technology to throw

935
02:15:39,510 --> 02:15:49,909
that shit on whatever all right let's move on i fucked up i fucked up you trail along behind

936
02:15:49,909 --> 02:16:09,189
the goblins like a shadow can't move on yet that was really dumb i don't know for some reason i

937
02:16:09,189 --> 02:16:15,289
was thinking about in my mind i'm thinking about a tool with like earth carved in it somehow being

938
02:16:15,289 --> 02:16:20,739
shot out of a cannon into space like it's not a rocket we just have a bag floating around in space

939
02:16:20,739 --> 02:16:26,939
it's not on a rocket ship there's a bag in space that they come across and it's shitty tools and

940
02:16:26,939 --> 02:16:36,709
a wheel right that's what i was thinking of like we don't leave a rocket ship it's just a bag

941
02:16:43,819 --> 02:16:48,059
these like primitive cavemen are just taking their tools and throwing them as hard as they can into

942
02:16:48,059 --> 02:17:04,120
the air it'll get we'll get soon strong reach space imagine if we did kind of what ellon mustered

943
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:24,010
with the car but instead slingshot on a metal box with sticks and shiny rocks yeah who cares

944
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:30,739
all right all right i'm done with i'm done we're gonna move on it's just too stupid to not at least

945
02:17:30,739 --> 02:17:41,459
spend five minutes on it what if wood was rare to them that's true too like shit we gotta be careful

946
02:17:41,459 --> 02:17:49,379
what if trees what if wood was an unbelievable resource and the aliens are like wait a minute

947
02:17:49,379 --> 02:17:59,559
they have wood on this planet liquefy it and take all the trees don't send anything to space

948
02:17:59,559 --> 02:18:06,229
they can come find us okay we don't send anything to space some people might see it as a threat

949
02:18:06,229 --> 02:18:12,950
uh boss there's a metal box here that has earth carved on it and there's an ax in here shoot the

950
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:24,979

02:21:56,940 --> 02:22:04,260
of me sitting in this chair having an infinite amount of rants about the alien joke no it's just

975

us and the bugs there's nothing else it's just us and the fucking earwigs who is he talking to

976
02:22:23,270 --> 02:22:26,629
i know i'm stalling all right all right i'm not stalling though this is just an interesting

977
02:22:26,629 --> 02:22:38,700
conversation what if they came down and they were large sentient earwigs i get to stick around

978
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:44,059
because i they will look at all my history here and they'll be like this guy was talking about

979
02:22:44,059 --> 02:22:49,719
earwigs and he talked about how they were cool and they were an awesome group of uh beings and

980
02:22:49,719 --> 02:22:58,889
i they would i would become an ambassador to earth sorry guys would you ever eat earwig meat

981
02:22:58,889 --> 02:23:03,530
no all right you trail along behind the goblins like a shadow god we've been sitting for like

982
02:23:03,530 --> 02:23:10,569
10 minutes the vaclands tribes are ready the first goblin general hisses second goblin makes a

983
02:23:10,569 --> 02:23:16,170
chittering noise something close to a laugh ready to run through the city like a river of molten

984
02:23:16,170 --> 02:23:22,180
steel that her word from the king a few words but i have learned a few of myself

985
02:23:23,690 --> 02:23:50,149
hey what was that freeze or keep up i probably get high right right over here freeze you freeze

986
02:23:50,149 --> 02:23:55,129
the goblins keep walking away out of earshot not stopping they do not look around but continue

987
02:23:55,129 --> 02:24:09,750
talking in low voices catch up you hurry up and catch up with the goblins i thought i said a corpse

988
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:22,569
the tunnel turns a corner something glints from the side of the sewer i gotta keep up i have to

989
02:24:23,209 --> 02:24:49,479
keep up i missed it you missed the spell line what i missed the spell line no i didn't keep up

990
02:24:49,479 --> 02:24:56,569
i'm gonna run right into them keep up i heard nothing the other replies you heard a key pace

991
02:24:56,569 --> 02:25:08,280
just behind them in the dark further on you know one of the lines one goblin is quizzing the other

992
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:17,850
the goblin spits an agreement i ever had the mad king whispered to himself in forger's pride

993
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:23,959
you can't believe your luck it's the second half of theta's spell line i got them all now

994
02:25:23,959 --> 02:25:35,219
i win got it we've got all the lines we just don't know the order but it's okay this is the

995
02:25:35,219 --> 02:25:41,059
first time i'm ever going to complete part two truly actually getting the good end and not the

996
02:25:41,059 --> 02:25:49,979
bad end every single time okay something let's look at it you stop to look at it losing the

997
02:25:49,979 --> 02:25:55,420
sight of the goblins it's a vial of it's a vial of potion sniff it you uncork it and sniff it it's

998
02:25:55,420 --> 02:26:06,739
blimbleberry quaff it i should probably quaff it yeah i quaff it you unstoppable the blimberry

999
02:26:06,739 --> 02:26:12,340
potion and knock it back quickly you feel a little better and all traces of hunger are gone also

1000
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:21,850
the goblins disappear so does that actually mean that i know everything do i know the whole thing

1001
02:26:21,850 --> 02:26:36,520
i got the whole thing by corgas grace and forga's pride one lock made of golems hide tumblers to

1002
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:48,260
seal deep inside i bid you portals open wide got it that's definitely the order that's the rhyme

1003
02:26:49,940 --> 02:27:02,459
okay i can turn back or we can keep going as we'll just keep going if the king knew you even knew

1004
02:27:02,459 --> 02:27:12,139
that much tell him and i cut your throat ah stay quiet and maybe we'll get out of this oh wait stay

1005
02:27:12,139 --> 02:27:17,750
quiet maybe we'll cut his throat just then you see more lights up ahead it seems the sewer is opening

1006
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:36,280
out into a wider space the opening all the lines rhyme do they one lock made of golems hide

1007
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:47,350
tumblers to seal deep inside like corga oh they all rhyme they all whatever

1008
02:27:55,639 --> 02:28:00,540
you slip into the hall it is warm with the fetid breath of a thousand creatures

1009
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:07,239
who drink and laugh and clash swords down in the muck on his throne their king seems to be sleeping

1010
02:28:07,239 --> 02:28:16,040
or else they have killed him by accident he's a man not a goblin how does he control this rabble

1011
02:28:16,040 --> 02:28:23,479
you wait transfixed by the strange scene the king coughs suddenly the effect is bizarre at the noise

1012
02:28:23,479 --> 02:28:35,020
every goblin in the great chamber freezes and looks up interesting the man is thin as if he

1013
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:42,360
has not eaten in months and pale as if he has been in the dark just as long his hair is long and gray

1014
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:48,379
and he slumps over the side of his throne as though desperately ill his clothes are long soiled robes

1015
02:28:48,379 --> 02:28:57,799
that perhaps were once quite fine on his hand is a ring a diamond ring which he gazes at periodically

1016
02:28:57,799 --> 02:29:05,110
and on his head he wears a gray circlet of a dull silver metal you cannot quite place the king pushes

1017
02:29:05,110 --> 02:29:13,559
on the arm of his chair attempting to stand then shivers and falls down silence the chamber is

1018
02:29:13,559 --> 02:29:25,530
suddenly quiet look at his face you peer through the gloom through the grime and dirt and the

1019
02:29:25,530 --> 02:29:31,530
thickness of his beard trying to see his face there's something familiar about it you've seen

1020
02:29:31,530 --> 02:29:41,450
it somewhere before the king fingers the circlet on his head as if scared it will slip my creatures

1021
02:29:41,450 --> 02:29:51,260
the time is almost on us as the night draws in we will rise up and open the gates we will rub this

1022
02:29:51,260 --> 02:30:03,659
filthy city clean he's broken off into a fit of coughing you keep waiting wanting to see what

1023
02:30:03,659 --> 02:30:12,100
comes next the long journey is nearly over the process i began when i blinded lord theta

1024
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:18,700
and left him a beggar finally the council will be destroyed and the city will be

1025
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:36,629
cleansed it's not dumbledore so this is this is sansa's yeah this is the first noble uh i'm

1026
02:30:36,629 --> 02:30:44,459
afraid if i keep listening you stay hidden a goblin close by by your elbow murmurs how much

1027
02:30:44,459 --> 02:30:51,700
longer do we have to listen to this his companion silences him with a talon to the arm shut up wait

1028
02:30:51,700 --> 02:30:57,180
and listen you stay hidden and wait the king finally gets to his feet and raised into wise an arm

1029
02:30:57,180 --> 02:31:07,579
into the air i will open the gates for you tonight and we will make this city pure the king raises a

1030
02:31:07,579 --> 02:31:15,450
cheer and the goblins as one cheer back throwing their swords up in the air a thousand blades flash

1031
02:31:15,450 --> 02:31:21,379
and the confusion when they landed extreme every goblin cowering for cover and then squabbling to

1032
02:31:21,379 --> 02:31:33,620
retrieve their blade all right let's go move now it's time to get the hell out of here creep to a

1033
02:31:33,620 --> 02:31:45,139
ladder or return to the sewer well i think we can get out this way sticking to the shadows you begin

1034
02:31:45,139 --> 02:31:48,979
to creep around the perimeter of the hall aiming for one of those long ladders that disappear up

1035
02:31:48,979 --> 02:31:54,889
into the darkness you get about halfway before the goblins nearby turn pushing at each other

1036
02:31:54,889 --> 02:31:59,979
and you are forced to freeze the king calls for silence but the goblins do not hear him they are

1037
02:31:59,979 --> 02:32:06,120
still in a mess with their swords go go go get out go just leave just run run run run run run

1038
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:19,139
keep going keep going no no you creep further around the edge of the hall the king calls a

1039
02:32:19,139 --> 02:32:25,299
again for silence clutching his circlet with one hand this time the goblins fall silent you realize

1040
02:32:25,299 --> 02:32:28,979
with a heavy heart that you've missed the best opportunity you will get to escape the chamber by

1041
02:32:28,979 --> 02:33:10,360
the ladder what look at his face all right i'm okay you know who it is familiar all right go

1042
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:26,629
andy rewind that's fine uh yep keep going make a move we get out the long journey is nearly over

1043
02:33:26,629 --> 02:33:38,360
the process i began when i blinded lord theta left him a beggar let's go and we're out how much

1044
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:48,180
longer do we have to listen to this make a move they raise a cheer hooray make a move we're out

1045
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:54,739
get out leave quick taking advantage of the confusion you scurry quickly up the ladder

1046
02:33:54,739 --> 02:33:59,860
for a few rungs you are in the open it must look like a strange oversized rat climbing the rigging

1047
02:33:59,860 --> 02:34:04,950
in this underground cell but you climb fast and quietly and are quickly lost into the shadows

1048
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:14,790
overhead once more you climb the ladder into a narrow stone chimney which climbs at an angle

1049
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:19,110
after a while the ladder gives out and there is nothing but stone above you in the distance

1050
02:34:19,110 --> 02:34:37,340
a circle of light god i'm gonna fall right back down on my back gum raz sharpen blade

1051
02:34:37,899 --> 02:34:53,350
with oh i can probably stick it in the side force field float in the air float would work

1052
02:34:53,350 --> 02:35:07,659
yeah let's float float in the air you cast the spell making your body featherweight

1053
02:35:07,659 --> 02:35:11,739
you then paw your way up the stone chimney pushing off the walls with your hands and feet

1054
02:35:11,739 --> 02:35:16,819
as if you were dancing up towards the light you emerge in a grateful heap to the fresh air of the

1055
02:35:16,819 --> 02:35:29,270
outside world it's oh it's right here we're i got the let's go let's go go go go go you've emerged

1056
02:35:29,270 --> 02:35:33,670
from a well house in a clearing in the shadow of the city wall looking around you realize how far

1057
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:38,469
you've come on the other side of this clearing is the north gate itself wasting no time you stride

1058
02:35:38,469 --> 02:35:45,239
over to the gate we gotta go now you reach the other side of the clearing unscathed and stand

1059
02:35:45,239 --> 02:36:01,860
below the enormous doors okay what's the the north gate spell i know what the first line is

1060
02:36:01,860 --> 02:36:14,620
here it is something that the corgas grace one lock deep inside i bid you corgo lock deep bid

1061
02:36:17,540 --> 02:36:26,360
let's go recite the spell you knock firmly on the door until you wake with the voice

1062
02:36:27,479 --> 02:36:36,149
you knock firmly on the door until you wake the voice within do you know the spell to open this

1063
02:36:36,149 --> 02:36:44,149
gate you close your eyes and try to recall the scratched poem in the sewer chamber of by corgas

1064
02:36:44,149 --> 02:36:55,159
grace and forgus pride one lock made of golems hide tumblers too sealed deep inside i bid you

1065
02:36:55,159 --> 02:37:05,510
portals open wide you stand back to see what effect your lines have had the voice has gone silent

1066
02:37:05,510 --> 02:37:13,000
you wait impatiently to see what will happen then the gate creaks the tumblers drop and the

1067
02:37:13,079 --> 02:37:21,100
wooden panels begin to move the door is opening booming out the voice declares the gate is under

1068
02:37:21,100 --> 02:37:33,159
your control but it is moving slowly looking over your shoulder you see an army of goblins

1069
02:37:33,159 --> 02:37:41,780
emerging from a well shaft and they are racing towards you oh do i just run i've i don't think

1070
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:49,459
we've ever done this do i just run through go go go go go you rush through the gate into the back

1071
02:37:49,459 --> 02:38:00,840
lens okay just go go go go this i'm not waiting beyond the north gate in the darkness around you

1072
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:07,959
figures are moving pouring towards the gate into the city inside you see the goblins still coming

1073
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:18,299
close it on him gate close the gate obeys immediately swinging shut like a trap

1074
02:38:19,190 --> 02:38:24,229
from the low hills around red-faced marsh goblins are springing up and pouring towards the sealed

1075
02:38:24,229 --> 02:38:29,350
gate like flies into a fallen ox they begin to scramble on top of one another trying to

1076
02:38:29,430 --> 02:38:36,709
bridge the wall with their own bodies destroy the goblins the goblins must be destroyed

1077
02:38:37,270 --> 02:38:46,459
as though on command a ghostly figure forms in the air before you it is lorag you control the gate

1078
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:59,350
use it uh you do it uh i don't know how try it is hopeless how can you use a magic you do not know

1079
02:39:00,149 --> 02:39:05,350
you close your eyes feeling your anger and frustration rising the hated goblins this

1080
02:39:05,350 --> 02:39:09,989
meddling specter the long and difficult road behind and the ones still to come all seem to

1081
02:39:09,989 --> 02:39:17,690
bite into your very soul like wolf teeth there is suddenly a terrible sound and a smell of burning

1082
02:39:21,639 --> 02:39:29,370
open my eyes you open your eyes there's not a goblin in sight just blackened grass around the

1083
02:39:29,370 --> 02:39:37,500
gate and black soot and piles on top of the wall the ghost nods slowly to you

1084
02:39:44,500 --> 02:39:50,180
i'll keep it on fuck it all the hatred of the whole city of thieves and liars and murderers

1085
02:39:50,180 --> 02:39:56,500
stored for centuries a little leak towered into the red eyes the rest was waiting for this for one

1086
02:39:56,500 --> 02:40:06,340
strong of hard enough to use it go be safe the long road is long huh he gestures to the path ahead

1087
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:26,760
be safe you're not in turn to go so what so i burn the city so that's my i did it no just the

1088
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:34,680
goblins though this is getting intense all right here we go outside kare into the back lands

1089
02:40:35,319 --> 02:40:43,110
from a short distance away you look back to see the plane outside the gate is quite empty

1090
02:40:43,829 --> 02:40:50,219
not a single marsh goblin remains but a single short sword or hooked pick it is like they have

1091
02:40:50,219 --> 02:40:56,059
been wiped from the surface of the earth and inside kare something similar must have occurred

1092
02:40:56,059 --> 02:40:59,180
as where there was the sound of flashing swords there is now only silence

1093
02:41:00,219 --> 02:41:07,270
you have saved kare a foul city perhaps but not one whose citizens deserve to die by a goblin

1094
02:41:07,270 --> 02:41:14,729
sword but it has been at a cost to your strength you turn your back your own road lies ahead

1095
02:41:15,370 --> 02:41:22,940
through the plains of badubak and on towards mampang the back lands await you remember the

1096
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:28,260
words of the site master sergeant as you left the outpost settlement once you have crossed the city

1097
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:33,930
port of traps you will enter the backlands they say that day and night are controlled by forces

1098
02:41:33,930 --> 02:41:51,379
other than the sun and from kare too your progress will be watched to badubak your journey across

1099
02:41:51,379 --> 02:41:58,020
kare is complete in the course of your journey you committed murder and saved the city port of

1100
02:41:58,020 --> 02:42:04,549
kare from destruction you played 11 games of swindle stones winning nine and losing two

1101
02:42:05,719 --> 02:42:10,280
you learned the truth about what the crown does a riddle about the sleepless ram

1102
02:42:10,280 --> 02:42:15,799
and that silver weapons harm the undead you collected a fantastic number of magical artifacts

1103
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:21,559
large lump of beeswax a cloth skullcap two giants teeth seven goblins teeth a black face mask

1104

poison a bottle of bark essence a bottle of snake bite antidote and a tinderbox you're very happy

1106
02:42:33,450 --> 02:42:39,579

1125
02:54:54,229 --> 02:55:03,559
from manland to the east mighty mountains claw at the stars you stand on the edge of badu bak

1126
02:55:03,559 --> 02:55:15,500
wild and evil place beyond lies man pang fortress the archmage the crown of kings the path has been

1127
02:55:19,110 --> 02:55:25,930
title update we will in a second leaving the hills you journeyed into kare and saved it from

1128
02:55:25,930 --> 02:55:33,879
destruction by goblins you brave the deadly portal traps of the city ancient cruel magic

1129
02:55:33,879 --> 02:55:41,610
designed to trap the unwary and you faced an army of enchanted werewolves as they sought to

1130
02:55:41,610 --> 02:55:49,530
overthrow the first noble i fought one werewolf but you know i could say an army i fought one

1131
02:55:49,530 --> 02:55:58,229
werewolf that's fine one werewolf attacked me on the road and uh i killed it but the backlands

1132
02:55:58,229 --> 02:56:09,399
are different but the plains of badu bak will be different once long ago this land thrived

1133
02:56:09,399 --> 02:56:15,610
prospering in the warm shadow of the fortress of sorcerers high in the zanzunu peaks then

1134
02:56:15,610 --> 02:56:22,250
something changed they say the last refugee to reach kare declared only they are all gone

1135
02:56:22,250 --> 02:56:33,479
the north gate was sealed and the backlands left to die now the gates stand open they say the land

1136
02:56:33,479 --> 02:56:39,690
beyond the gates is cursed no one from the young country of aniland has ever crossed this wilderness

1137
02:56:39,690 --> 02:56:46,709
before you will be the first the old world is counting on you but already you have no food

1138
02:56:46,709 --> 02:56:54,340
this stage of your journey will be punishing but you cannot turn back ladies and gentlemen

1139
02:56:54,340 --> 02:57:18,739
inkle presents a story by steve jackson steve jackson's story part three the seven servants

1140
02:57:18,739 --> 02:57:31,129
is the gate of kare again let's take a look at this here you go it's very large it's like five

1141
02:57:31,129 --> 02:57:44,170
different world of warcraft zones and something else happens here too that's even more ridiculous

1142
02:57:44,170 --> 02:57:53,079
and you'll find out if you don't know and if you do know don't tell anybody because it's cool it's

1143
02:57:53,079 --> 02:58:07,479
cool and we're gonna let everybody figure that out no spoilers here we go the stones of the old road

1144
02:58:07,479 --> 02:58:13,430
disappear under a layer of dust and sand at your back looms the great wall the city port of kare

1145
02:58:13,510 --> 02:58:23,209
ahead there is nothing but an empty waste and the night you cast a glance at the city port even now

1146
02:58:23,209 --> 02:58:29,829
vic is taking control the baying of his wolves echoes across the plains that's a storyline

1147
02:58:29,829 --> 02:58:39,379
we did not do but um the city's there and vic apparently has taken it look up at the stars

1148
02:58:39,379 --> 02:58:45,399
you turn your gaze from kare to the stars wondering what fresh secrets they may hold

1149
02:58:45,399 --> 02:58:56,840
this far from the walls of aniland into the plains every step along the broken road takes you further

1150
02:58:56,840 --> 02:59:03,819
from safety and into the unknown something the ape perhaps sets your senses tingling you're not

1151
02:59:03,819 --> 02:59:23,030
alone out here is that the screech of a bird you hear or a distant scream we could talk to animals

1152
02:59:24,899 --> 02:59:40,840
we could uh just throw a fireball into the air we could sense danger let's talk to animals all

1153
02:59:40,840 --> 02:59:52,840
right let's try it it doesn't cost anything you cast the spell and pull on the wig in the distance

1154
02:59:52,840 --> 02:59:57,319
you hear the screeching of birds but as the spell takes hold the sound resolves into words

1155
02:59:59,079 --> 03:00:07,559
there's one he looks like a tasty morsel i claim first strike a moment later a ferocious

1156
03:00:07,559 --> 03:00:16,700
nighthawk has plunged from the sky talon's outstretched for your neck worse voice shut up

1157

03:00:46,170 --> 03:00:55,420
past your neck to rake the dirt i will shred you to your gizzards tasty one the bird wheels up

1160
03:00:55,420 --> 03:01:00,459
into the sky to rejoin its group take his eyes take his eyes you count four birds circling ready

1161

to attack shout in defiance try to take me i have killed a manticore we will take your blood all

1162

1163
03:01:40,569 --> 03:01:45,979
i don't think they're magical well they don't talk i can i can understand them because i have

1164
03:01:45,979 --> 03:01:53,959

1166
03:02:17,850 --> 03:02:25,610

1167
03:02:25,610 --> 03:02:31,000
as your weight is reduced to that of a feather the nighthawks do not pause one swoops talon

1168
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:40,889
spiking your shoulder knocking you sprawling to the ground i prick you i'm dead you stay down

1169
03:02:40,889 --> 03:02:46,219
hoping the bird will leave you for dead but nighthawks do not attack for pleasure but for

1170
03:02:46,219 --> 03:02:54,010
food lying still makes them bold and soon all three are diving for you then quite suddenly

1171
03:02:54,010 --> 03:02:59,899
the nighthawks break formation something else is shimmering into visibility in their very midst

1172
03:02:59,899 --> 03:03:10,069
you settle back to the ground as your spell wears off wait what so wait they hit me in the

1173
03:03:10,069 --> 03:03:14,549
in the air midair and i'm lying down but pretending to be lagged out of the server

1174
03:03:15,110 --> 03:03:25,860
i'm just floating there falling slowly on my side all right i'm running crawl you belly crawl

1175
03:03:26,500 --> 03:03:32,649
up to higher ground while behind you the strangest of battles ensues the wing of one nighthawk snaps

1176
03:03:32,649 --> 03:03:39,270
upwards like a broken branch a second is ripped into feathers by invisible claws the remaining

1177
03:03:39,270 --> 03:03:54,709
birds scatter there's nothing left but your mysterious savior uh i'm gonna stay hidden you

1178
03:03:54,709 --> 03:04:00,340
stay low hoping the creature will not see you but there is a rush of air just in front of you

1179
03:04:00,340 --> 03:04:06,729
whatever it is has landed you hear the movement of unseen feathered wings and then at last you

1180
03:04:06,729 --> 03:04:19,959
understand this creature is a gold crest eagle from the king's own eerie in aniland the eerie

1181
03:04:19,959 --> 03:04:27,239
is deep behind the shumantanti wall it must have flown for three days to reach you but why the

1182
03:04:27,239 --> 03:04:36,360
creature slowly becoming visible sees you have recognized it it tilts its beak bow you bow your

1183
03:04:36,360 --> 03:04:42,760
head to the eagle it opens its beak in reply and something falls to the ground it is a message

1184
03:04:42,760 --> 03:04:47,750
cylinder whatever it contains must be of vital importance or the king would not have risked

1185
03:04:47,750 --> 03:04:59,129
revealing your location like this to deliver it to you take the tube you reach down and pick up

1186
03:04:59,129 --> 03:05:03,690
the tube inside is a rolled parchment sealed with the royal seal of the king of aniland

1187
03:05:03,690 --> 03:05:15,370
but you pause for a moment and sigh the king has accidentally sent you his letter to santa claus

1188
03:05:15,370 --> 03:05:27,829
it must have been some kind of mix-up okay let me read this we trust these tidings reach you in

1189
03:05:27,829 --> 03:05:35,700
fair health but must warn you of impending peril your mission is discovered the man pangs eyes have

1190
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:43,209
spied our plan and word is on its way to the dark fortress too late we discovered our unwelcome

1191
03:05:43,209 --> 03:05:49,530
eavesdroppers and news of your quest is being carried towards high xamen by the seven serpents

1192
03:05:49,610 --> 03:05:55,180
the archmage's most trusted servants by now they will have reached the backlands

1193
03:05:55,180 --> 03:06:01,940
and here they will divide to complete their journey separately if you are still able seek

1194
03:06:01,940 --> 03:06:09,049
them out for they must stop to rest and eat destroy the creatures before they reach their goal

1195
03:06:09,049 --> 03:06:17,299
else the archmage will prepare a deadly welcome for you find shadrach the hermit for advice

1196
03:06:17,299 --> 03:06:26,420
for not moves through the backlands without his knowledge our hearts are with you the seal

1197
03:06:26,420 --> 03:06:36,659
fucking george washington thank the eagle you look up but the goldcrest eagle has already

1198
03:06:36,659 --> 03:06:41,370
rendered itself invisible once more you feel the rush of air as its great wings lift it from the

1199
03:06:41,370 --> 03:06:52,309
ground and you are alone destroy it or keep it i feel like maybe keep it because this might be

1200
03:06:52,309 --> 03:07:00,729
proof like hey i've got the king of aniland has the seal here maybe it's i could use it for help

1201
03:07:00,729 --> 03:07:13,000
that's possible right or destroy it because if somebody finds it on me then they know what i'm

1202
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:31,450
doing here keep it to show the hermit yeah i'm not sure either way how this would work um yeah

1203
03:07:31,450 --> 03:07:37,829
we'll do a poll should i destroy the message or hold on to it in case i need to use it it's pretty

1204
03:07:37,829 --> 03:07:59,850
50 50 on what would happen i need food and i need to sleep this is bad one or two what are we

1208
03:08:54,409 --> 03:08:58,969

1209
03:08:58,969 --> 03:09:04,729
had supposed you must find these seven serpents and destroy them or your journey will be for

1210
03:09:04,729 --> 03:09:14,940
nothing two new clues what are the clues seven serpents seven serpents threaten your journey

1211
03:09:14,940 --> 03:09:22,139
for they carry a message that will warn the archmage of your coming uh shadrack the hermit

1212
03:09:22,139 --> 03:09:30,709
can help you only silver weapons can harm the undead you are given a clue about the backlands

1213
03:09:31,350 --> 03:09:42,170
for sleeping of the sleepless ram seek the one they call the sham okay still have all my shit

1214
03:09:42,170 --> 03:09:55,030
right yeah all right back to the road the stars turned in the sky overhead taking the pole as

1215
03:09:55,030 --> 03:10:01,270
your guide you rejoin the old road and make your way north before you the backlands stretch away

1216
03:10:01,270 --> 03:10:08,680
to a dim horizon how can you hope to locate seven serpents in such a wilderness my spirit will guide

1217
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:18,760
me the ape my spirit will guide me you will no doubt require the ape even more than ever before

1218
03:10:19,319 --> 03:10:29,030
out here where nothing else can be trusted and the ape has told you to walk off of a cliff so you do

1219
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:38,760
it no decision is permanent rewind at any time that it was that was that wrong after about half

1220
03:10:38,760 --> 03:10:44,200
an hour you see a deep black line across the earth up ahead and catch your step just in time

1221
03:10:44,200 --> 03:10:50,280
you are one pace away from the edge of a sheer cliff a few loose stones disappear over the edge

1222
03:10:50,280 --> 03:10:59,370
and clatter away into the dark look for a way down rest until daylight uh i need stamina

1223
03:10:59,370 --> 03:11:25,350
stamina sun what would that do here how what would that do sun jewel oh so i can see down

1224
03:11:25,350 --> 03:11:34,579
oh i'm gonna do that doesn't cause i don't want to do anything that costs stamina looking to the

1225
03:11:34,579 --> 03:11:39,700
stars you craft the magic and the sun jewel in your back begins to pulse and throb with a brilliant

1226
03:11:39,700 --> 03:11:46,069
blinding light with the light from the jewel you look over the cliff and make out a set of

1227
03:11:46,069 --> 03:11:52,700
worn carved steps leading downwards it seems there definitely is a path here or there was

1228
03:11:52,700 --> 03:12:01,129
many hundreds or thousands of years ago climb down you creep towards the stone steps and begin

1229
03:12:01,129 --> 03:12:15,260
to make your way down okay that that works the cold night lingers on using the light from your

1230
03:12:15,260 --> 03:12:20,940
sun jewel you feel your way forward but halfway down the glow on the gem begins to fade you begin

1231
03:12:20,940 --> 03:12:32,819
to curse your decision to come this way throw the jewel no what i don't want to throw it this thing

1232
03:12:32,819 --> 03:12:41,479
is very very useful keep going you focus on placing your feet carefully and continue to make

1233
03:12:41,479 --> 03:12:47,510
your way down the cliff face like a goat the glow from your gem fades and you are plunged into

1234
03:12:47,510 --> 03:12:53,270
darkness once more the ground is closer than you realize and when the staircase runs out and turns

1235
03:12:53,270 --> 03:12:59,530
into loose scree it is a rough but thankfully short slide to the bottom you land with a thump

1236
03:12:59,530 --> 03:13:11,719
at the base of the cliff why would i have thrown the jewel you've reached the bottom of the cliff

1237
03:13:12,170 --> 03:13:18,299
the sky is already beginning to warm in the east the rock wall rises behind you cutting out half

1238
03:13:18,299 --> 03:13:24,940
the sky the staircase is now invisible just shadows on shadows in the craggy rock in the

1239
03:13:24,940 --> 03:13:29,829
near distance across the plains and away from the cliff you can see a dark shape jutting up from the

1240
03:13:29,829 --> 03:13:53,379
ground like a gigantic sword rest here out in the open in the dark zen hmm zip i don't have i could

1241
03:13:53,379 --> 03:14:01,399
teleport and get whatever the green ring is uh i might be okay that's one stamp anything free

1242
03:14:02,200 --> 03:14:20,200
what do i have that's free heel disease this is three this is a lot isn't it um i'll do how

1243
03:14:22,469 --> 03:14:30,520
because yeah let's do how i'm gonna die if i'm not careful you bind the starling to shape around you

1244
03:14:30,520 --> 03:14:35,959
and a familiar calm voice begins to speak voice tells you that the stairs are long since destroyed

1245
03:14:35,959 --> 03:15:00,020
and will never be rebuilt okay thanks i want safe passage not the history of the stairs i'll rest

1246
03:15:00,020 --> 03:15:07,479
let me look at the cliff you gaze up the soaring arc of the cliff barren rock dusted by what little

1247
03:15:07,479 --> 03:15:14,340
scrub can cling onto its sides it is as if some great clawed hand had scooped out the earth the

1248
03:15:14,340 --> 03:15:24,680
foot of the cliff is pitted with shadow holes no doubt dug by animals you peer through the gloom

1249
03:15:25,319 --> 03:15:30,280
trying to make out more details whatever the structure is it does not appear natural

1250
03:15:30,280 --> 03:15:37,340
but equally it does not appear to be intact seems to be sliding into the earth strange

1251
03:15:37,340 --> 03:15:48,920
the backlands were said to be uninhabited i i have to sleep we have to i have to rest here you find

1252
03:15:48,920 --> 03:15:55,340
an old fox hole and scramble inside at least you've eaten already today so do not need to

1253
03:15:55,340 --> 03:16:01,799
eat again to avoid hunger though more food will make you stronger you'll eat to eat once a day

1254
03:16:01,799 --> 03:16:15,379
all right close my eyes nothing bad nothing bad nothing bad nothing bad nothing bad you close your

1255
03:16:15,379 --> 03:16:21,430
eyes and let your tiredness overtake you the silence is loud in your ears slowly you're

1256
03:16:21,430 --> 03:16:27,959
understanding the true loneliness of this place you long for human company even the withering insults

1257
03:16:27,959 --> 03:16:42,170
of flanker but there is no one here you feel quite safe and you do not dream cliff face during the

1258
03:16:42,170 --> 03:16:49,590
past day you've become weaker reached the pit of the backlands and found four new clues you pull

1259
03:16:49,590 --> 03:16:59,180
yourself out of your hole and stand up okay i got two health nearby is a stone tower the only stone

1260
03:16:59,180 --> 03:17:05,909
structure in the whole barren landscape it is the shape you saw here at night look at the tower the

1261
03:17:05,909 --> 03:17:11,700
tower stands some way across the plane almost in the foothills of the ridge it lists to one side

1262
03:17:11,700 --> 03:17:20,170
but appears not to have crumbled into ruin move on this then is the plane of badubak an endless

1263
03:17:20,170 --> 03:17:26,440
expanse of dust broken only by the thin outline of an ancient road no one from aniland has been

1264
03:17:26,440 --> 03:17:33,670
here no one even knows what happened to this place once it was the archmage's country his fields and

1265
03:17:33,670 --> 03:17:43,159
paddocks and now it is too barren to even be a place of death what do we do this is quite this

1266
03:17:43,159 --> 03:17:57,110
is quite the early decision he just came and said what the fuck is happening all right uh i'll get

1267
03:17:57,110 --> 03:18:02,620
a poll going because we're either gonna go because let's let's give it a big picture here

1268
03:18:02,620 --> 03:18:17,290
where are they going this way right this way or this way so i'm it's going to be four choices but

1269
03:18:17,290 --> 03:18:31,450
i imagine yeah so ready pay attention one two three four again follow the cliff one into the

1270
03:18:31,450 --> 03:18:47,909
plane two follow this cliff three the old road four one two three four one two three four got it

1271
03:18:47,909 --> 03:19:06,540
again one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four

1272
03:19:06,540 --> 03:19:28,020
one two three four you got it two four three one four four three four four four two four two one

1273
03:19:28,020 --> 03:19:45,110
did i get it right did i get the code right where are we going baby sensory hey wait what was it

1274
03:19:45,110 --> 03:19:51,110
again i wasn't paying attention oh that's easy that it's four or you get all you get one or it's two

1275
03:19:51,110 --> 03:20:02,219
you go four or four or four or three all right let's go four you leave the shadow of the cliff

1276
03:20:02,219 --> 03:20:07,500
for the road that cuts across the plane the air stirs a little still cold but at least fresh

1277
03:20:07,500 --> 03:20:12,280
from here the path is uncertain badubak is a wasteland and there is no pass through

1278
03:20:12,280 --> 03:20:20,229
the great ridge that forms its eastern border the forest of snata is uncharted the zanzunu peaks

1279
03:20:20,229 --> 03:20:26,629
and mampang seem remote the forest of snata to the east of the ridge is uncharted and the

1280
03:20:26,629 --> 03:20:35,450
clatterback steps are said to be home only to under evolved half humans no tracks climb the horns

1281
03:20:35,450 --> 03:20:43,719
of ilk lala no tracks climb the horns of ilk lala that lie beyond the forest and there is no bridge

1282
03:20:43,719 --> 03:20:50,010
across the great lake beyond that there may be no road at all when the archmage sent his birdmen to

1283
03:20:50,010 --> 03:20:58,860
steal the crown of kings they flew but you must walk lala there is no alternative the future of

1284
03:20:58,860 --> 03:21:07,979
the old world depends on you finding your way across this lonely dust bowl jesus christ um

1285
03:21:09,610 --> 03:21:19,500
well we're okay strike out north the blasted tree along the road okay well we're going

1286
03:21:19,500 --> 03:21:25,899
we're not going this way you've already decided to go this way we're not going from here to here to

1287
03:21:25,899 --> 03:21:32,940
here you had a choice to go from here to here and you didn't choose it so we're going this way so

1288
03:21:32,940 --> 03:21:45,639
you do get a choice here though you get a one two three lala you didn't choose to go that way you

1289
03:21:45,639 --> 03:22:28,260
chose to go this way one two three one two three three two one two two two two three three three

1290
03:22:28,260 --> 03:22:35,540
three three three three three three three three three two two two two two two two two two two two

1291
03:22:35,540 --> 03:22:55,100
one two one one two one one two one one three one two one one one sick fucking beat hey dude i just

1292
03:22:55,100 --> 03:23:03,639
joined what's happening he said i actually just joined and i thought my computer was actually

1293
03:23:03,639 --> 03:23:11,059
glitching i got you i got you i got you all right we're going one and then i'm going to start

1294
03:23:11,059 --> 03:23:18,709
making some decisions you know what i mean we're going to the blasted tree you leave the road and

1295
03:23:18,709 --> 03:23:24,969
walk across the desolate plain a few clouds scut across the sky after a while of walking you see

1296
03:23:24,969 --> 03:23:31,139
something to break the monotony too tall and thin for a skewer of rock or a building you cannot

1297
03:23:31,139 --> 03:23:39,700
place it until you get close it's a single tree leafless and dead tilting from the desolate soil

1298
03:23:39,700 --> 03:23:46,739
climb the branches that seems the tree must be the last remnant of an ancient forest

1299
03:23:46,739 --> 03:23:52,040
the why this particular trunk has survived when all the others fell is not clear and that is not

1300
03:23:52,040 --> 03:24:03,899
all a rope ladder hangs from one of the higher branches of the tree okay climb the rope ladder

1301
03:24:03,899 --> 03:24:14,280
this is like a tree house you scramble up the rope ladder to get a view across the lands

1302
03:24:14,280 --> 03:24:20,180
but the branches seem to be alive twisting and bending as you climb they're closing in around

1303
03:24:20,180 --> 03:24:33,209
you like a trap untie the ladder it's like a three stooges routine okay untie the ladder

1304
03:24:33,209 --> 03:24:40,219
the knots holding the ladder to the branch are thick with age but you manage to work them free

1305
03:24:40,219 --> 03:24:45,510
the branch underneath seems to lift in relief that is as it is removed a moment later another

1306
03:24:45,510 --> 03:24:51,479
branch draws backwards behind you and releases knocking you painfully to the ground for a moment

1307
03:24:51,479 --> 03:25:16,500
you hear a sound almost like a laugh who's there stranger stranger show yourself there is no

1308
03:25:16,500 --> 03:25:24,100
response surely this land is a desert you're entirely alone are you not we'll find out

1309
03:25:30,120 --> 03:25:38,860
hmm to burn the tree i could burn the tree i could read minds which would be interesting

1310
03:25:41,190 --> 03:25:55,620
uh sense danger i think that's all we have i only have four hp so that would be bad let's read minds

1311
03:25:55,620 --> 03:26:04,790
it's free you weave the enchantment pulling on the cloth skullcap as you do you reach out with

1312
03:26:04,790 --> 03:26:12,549
your mind but what you find is not what you expect there are no humans or even any creatures in the

1313
03:26:12,549 --> 03:26:20,459
vicinity instead there is an intelligence something heavy and dark and thick the thoughts like ancient

1314
03:26:20,459 --> 03:26:41,959
oil talk or listen let's talk you reach out further trying to connect with this strange other presence

1315
03:26:41,959 --> 03:26:49,110
you seem to make no progress and then the spell fades and you open your eyes to find yourself

1316
03:26:49,110 --> 03:27:01,379
staring another pair formed by the curved twigs of the tree itself a face stranger

1317
03:27:02,739 --> 03:27:20,379
you are lost what makes you say who are you what are you be warned i will not be played with i am

1318
03:27:20,379 --> 03:27:38,629
a spirit and an old friend okay well how are you a friend can you guide me the branches flutter

1319
03:27:38,629 --> 03:27:45,850
and break in a sudden gust of wind the face disappearing for a moment you seek the whereabouts

1320
03:27:45,850 --> 03:27:59,159
of a shard rack of badubak uh yeah where where is he turn like a leaf in the morning

1321
03:27:59,719 --> 03:28:08,100
through the fish tail rock he is expecting you another strong breeze catches the branches and

1322
03:28:08,100 --> 03:28:21,190
disturbs them and when they settle the face has disappeared fish tail rock come back get back here

1323
03:28:21,190 --> 03:28:31,799
you mother fucker uh wait you wait a short while but it's no good you walk away from the shade of

1324
03:28:31,799 --> 03:28:41,690
the tree all right we got a clue fish tail rock all right let's keep going this way we're not

1325
03:28:41,690 --> 03:28:47,379
going back this way you've already made your choice east along the road i told you that was

1326
03:28:47,379 --> 03:28:59,340
a major decision can you pray to get healed i can i don't want to use it unless i have to though

1327
03:28:59,340 --> 03:29:03,739
you walk on across the plane until you meet the edge of an old road as the morning moves on the

1328
03:29:03,739 --> 03:29:10,420
wind begins to rise the road snakes across the dust bowl in the nearest in the near distance you

1329
03:29:10,420 --> 03:29:17,450
make out something through the haze not a tower but a spire of rock seems to flicker strangely

1330
03:29:17,450 --> 03:29:29,590
from behind you a voice says excuse me turn around you turn around to find the road deserted

1331
03:29:29,590 --> 03:29:38,489
there is no one in sight in any direction where are you you call half expecting flanker to

1332
03:29:38,489 --> 03:29:45,579
materialize up from the dust to greet you there's no reply the cold wind whistles around you the

1333
03:29:45,579 --> 03:29:56,700
planes feel suddenly far emptier than a moment before you continue along the ghost road okay

1334
03:29:56,700 --> 03:30:08,170
you get a choice one or two one two one two one is towards the cliff two is head up east this way

1335
03:30:08,170 --> 03:30:17,639
and go so one is to go down probably here over here two is to go like here one is cliff two is

1336
03:30:17,639 --> 03:30:25,420
head east what do you think what do you think what do you think what do you think what do you think

1337
03:30:25,420 --> 03:31:04,180
what do you think please can you hit the two button a lot again uh no um no sorry no uh it's close

1338
03:31:04,180 --> 03:31:21,590
very close can you please hit the three button three i'll give you that i mean i'll give i'll

1339
03:31:21,590 --> 03:31:28,870
give you this too right like two no yeah i'll give you one a lot of you guys don't want to go to the

1340
03:31:28,870 --> 03:31:36,819
cliff interesting okay i don't remember what this is i don't remember what this is either i of all

1341
03:31:36,819 --> 03:31:44,409
the games forget these next two parts more than anything kare is my favorite so i obviously

1342
03:31:44,409 --> 03:31:52,540
remember a lot of stuff but i don't remember very much from this very much gone from my brain

1343
03:31:52,540 --> 03:32:03,100
all right we're going east you follow the old road the sun is hot now the road forks here with the

1344
03:32:03,100 --> 03:32:08,780
main path snaking up the mountainside of the east rocks have tumbled down the slope and all but cover

1345
03:32:08,780 --> 03:32:14,969
the road you cast your gaze east toward the towering badu back ridge the main peak is lost

1346
03:32:14,969 --> 03:32:21,260
in the haze at the end of the long winding road that climbs up the slope looking north the road

1347
03:32:21,260 --> 03:32:27,899
winds along the rocky edges of the foothills our particularly impressive stone stupa stands out a

1348
03:32:27,899 --> 03:32:40,819
little way along stone shift and move underfoot as you walk i mean two was cliff we talked about

1349
03:32:40,819 --> 03:33:00,950
two is the road all right i'm gonna make this decision this way heading towards the clatterbox

1350
03:33:00,950 --> 03:33:19,750
steps or up here into more of this kind of plains area let's go up the ground underfoot

1351
03:33:19,750 --> 03:33:25,819
turns into rocks and scree the sun has reached its highest point now out of the shade the air

1352
03:33:25,819 --> 03:33:32,459
is baking hot you pause to rest in the shadow of a large rock spire that sticks out from the dirt

1353
03:33:32,459 --> 03:33:40,389
like a claw through cloth the rock is a single shattered spire perhaps once part of the mountain

1354
03:33:40,389 --> 03:33:46,579
range to the east or perhaps driven up through the ground by some geological quirk at the base

1355
03:33:46,579 --> 03:33:55,270
of the rock is the mouth of a cave perhaps stuffed with buried treasure you approach the cave with

1356
03:33:55,270 --> 03:34:01,780
one hand on your blade the cave appears to go back some distance into pitch blackness someone

1357
03:34:01,780 --> 03:34:08,120
seems to have scratched a message into the rock inside the cave it is only just legible and must

1358
03:34:08,120 --> 03:34:17,139
be ancient in the thin sunlight falling into the cave you can make out the ancient scratch message

1359
03:34:17,139 --> 03:34:28,489
with some difficulty stranger i am waiting very long ago summon you call my name to the skies and

1360
03:34:28,489 --> 03:34:43,479
i will draw the message on the cave wall suggested calling out a name but what name should you call

1361
03:34:43,479 --> 03:35:02,860
flanker where are you shadrack jan well imagine calling jan's name here i mean we're gonna do

1362
03:35:02,860 --> 03:35:09,770
this right because that's shadrack you cry the name across the plains and the echo of it seems

1363
03:35:09,770 --> 03:35:15,459
to set off a distant avalanche the ground begins to shake and rumble and you stagger to your knees

1364
03:35:15,459 --> 03:35:20,969
the very earth is moving as though it was splitting or merging back together you reach down to steady

1365
03:35:20,969 --> 03:35:31,450
yourself only to find that the grass is growing between your fingers you pick yourself unsteadily

1366
03:35:31,450 --> 03:35:38,280
to your feet feeling sick and unwell everything around you is the same but everything is different

1367
03:35:38,280 --> 03:35:46,139
the rock has two spires for one thing the cave seems smaller and darker and in a fire pit built

1368
03:35:46,139 --> 03:35:57,770
into the scrub is its mouth is a fire burning from inside you hear the gentle sound of singing are

1369
03:35:57,770 --> 03:36:15,620

1372
03:36:34,540 --> 03:36:41,420
he sings in a language you do not recognize what its tune feels at once arresting an ancient and

1373
03:36:41,420 --> 03:36:54,899
the melody seems to soothe your soul you approach the fire call out for shadrack shadrack i am here

1374
03:36:54,899 --> 03:37:02,200
the singing stops abruptly there's a coughing and a wheezing sound and then an old man hobbles from

1375
03:37:02,200 --> 03:37:09,829
outside the cave limping on a stick this must be shadrack himself but you recognize the face as

1376
03:37:09,829 --> 03:37:20,040
that of the tree spirit you met earlier ah it's you i have been expecting you he waves a hand

1381
03:38:07,190 --> 03:38:15,530

1385
03:38:53,020 --> 03:39:00,040
i watched an army of marsh goblins scale the cliffs armed with swords and axes there should

1386
03:39:00,040 --> 03:39:06,309
be smoke rising at the horizon but i see no such thing he grabs a handful of dry grass from the

1387
03:39:06,309 --> 03:39:11,530
ground and tosses it into the fire pit where it blazes for a moment into flame he appears to

1388
03:39:11,530 --> 03:39:19,159
change topic i must warn you that no one from aniland has ever crossed the backlands alone

1389
03:39:19,159 --> 03:39:34,709
and survived the serpents yes but not only them the very rocks and earth here are lost things

1390
03:39:34,709 --> 03:39:45,000
become unstuck and you have now become unstuck yourself i i don't understand he demonstrated

1391
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:50,440
with his finger as he speaks twisting them together the old world in the ancient world

1392
03:39:50,440 --> 03:40:01,270
have grown together like thorny bushes to journey through one is to journey through the other you

1393
03:40:01,270 --> 03:40:09,129
have any do you have any food the ancient world you ask looking about yourself with the fields of

1394
03:40:09,129 --> 03:40:17,989
grass that have appeared to replace the desert istara the place that was my home you are most

1395
03:40:17,989 --> 03:40:30,780
welcome unexpectedly shadrach stumbles he smiles at you weakly oh are you unwell this whole land

1396
03:40:30,780 --> 03:40:39,270

1397
03:40:39,270 --> 03:40:48,969
leave you play swindle stones you come all of this way to speak with me and you want to do it by

1398
03:40:48,969 --> 03:40:59,959
playing dice why don't we talk oh you're just afraid i'm gonna win i do not think so and what

1399
03:40:59,959 --> 03:41:05,340
do you think you have to gain playing swindle stones against a telepath is beyond even my

1400
03:41:05,340 --> 03:41:14,379
cogniz do you have any food my my three wishes right i asked the genie asked the mage the

1401
03:41:14,379 --> 03:41:22,870
questions i'm hungry i want a car and um replace the toilet paper in my bathroom because it's low

1402
03:41:22,870 --> 03:41:32,260
why could i ask for anything worse i could get the answers to the universe do you have any food

1403
03:41:32,260 --> 03:41:43,260
that actually is important i am too holy to eat but if you can reach karyama north of the river

1404
03:41:43,260 --> 03:41:49,670
you may be able to eat well there if it still exists in your time most likely it does not

1405
03:41:49,670 --> 03:41:56,280
shadrach is shivering slightly now his face is pale beyond the ruddy beard how did this curse come

1406
03:41:56,280 --> 03:42:04,540
to be the land was cursed by the archmage to be forgotten and so it has been and so it will be

1407
03:42:04,540 --> 03:42:14,229
not long now and then all you will see will be gone only timeless desolation will remain but why

1408
03:42:16,459 --> 03:42:23,420
because of you the archmage punished this whole land to make a trap to kill you before you could

1409
03:42:23,420 --> 03:42:34,520
kill him he is a dangerous enemy and he is quite desperate uh i understand he has sent seven

1410
03:42:34,520 --> 03:42:44,950
serpents to kill me the hermit nods most seriously the serpents are most terrible i have often seen

1411
03:42:44,950 --> 03:42:53,190
them but they are no mere snakes do you know of their legend tell me i don't care just tell me how

1412
03:42:53,190 --> 03:43:06,870
to tell me yes i can do that better it is said that thousands of years from now a few years ago

1413
03:43:06,870 --> 03:43:14,840
for you perhaps the archmage of manpeng often slew a mighty hydra which dwelt in the caves of

1414
03:43:14,840 --> 03:43:20,579
high salmon so formidable a foe was his creature that the archmage took its seven heads back to

1415
03:43:20,579 --> 03:43:27,030
manpeng where he used his dark arch to resurrect them as seven winged serpents they became his

1416
03:43:27,030 --> 03:43:37,049
personal messengers his assassins his force in a dark place thousands of years from now indeed so

1417
03:43:37,049 --> 03:43:44,069
look about you i fancied this valley was not green with grass when you entered it he's right

1418
03:43:44,069 --> 03:43:55,860
it is the same valley and yet not the same i don't understand what has happened how much

the chat i don't want to see it ever again m i see ban it from the chat i never want to see it again

1507
03:58:21,020 --> 03:58:26,870
okay let him go he leaves heading west across the plains and fading into the hazy dust that

1508
03:58:26,870 --> 03:58:32,229
hangs in the air you muse on what you have seen it seems there is more to the backlands than

1509
03:58:32,229 --> 03:58:40,389
there first appeared you are left alone by the cave mouth once more yeah well take some stuff

1510
03:58:40,389 --> 03:58:45,659
from the cave you look into the cave again and this time find a strange horn hanging from a hook

1511
03:58:45,659 --> 03:58:52,229
on the wall it is ordinately carved from strange twisting shell for the height of leather it is a

1512
03:58:52,229 --> 03:59:07,639
gale horn one of very few in existence you lift it down with great care what are they saying over

1513
03:59:07,639 --> 03:59:15,750
here are they saying that word that i said not to say how dare they i can't believe they're

1514
03:59:15,750 --> 03:59:35,420
actually saying these things m i c k e y m o u s e blow the horn you place the horn to your lips

1515
03:59:35,420 --> 03:59:44,920
and blow a note it is a clean and mellow pitched and makes the air stir with echoes it is both

1516
03:59:44,920 --> 03:59:54,940
powerful and likely to be valuable should you decide to sell it you pause to look around the

1517
03:59:55,020 --> 04:00:00,870
plane then scrub grass stretches away north and west to the east the mountains are shadowing the

1518
04:00:00,870 --> 04:00:07,610
sun the whole world seems to have come alive around but surely this magic cannot last you make your

1519
04:00:07,610 --> 04:00:12,379
way back to the old road that runs past the rock to the north you catch a glimpse of the tower

1520
04:00:12,379 --> 04:00:18,579
shadrach mentioned covered in green ivy west you notice a young tree that surely wasn't there

1521
04:00:18,579 --> 04:00:46,860
before sick so this is the tree that we were at before let's go see it now you head out across

1522
04:00:46,860 --> 04:00:53,450
the prairie the sun begins to dip heading towards the horizon you swat at pestering flies and

1523
04:00:53,450 --> 04:01:00,729
images the dead tree you saw here earlier is now a young strong sapling in its shadow a woman sits

1524
04:01:00,729 --> 04:01:13,350
cross-legged with eyes closed you watch the woman for a moment she's breathing in and out slowly

1525
04:01:13,350 --> 04:01:19,899
and murmuring under her breath perhaps she's praying around her neck she wears what looks

1526
04:01:19,899 --> 04:01:26,819
like a giant's tooth on a leather string i've got a few of those a fleet of long thin birds

1527
04:01:26,819 --> 04:01:38,020
swoop and career overhead snatching flies from the steamy air steal the tooth i have enough uh i

greetings the woman opens one eye then shakes her head sadly you're meant to be over there she

1532
04:02:21,540 --> 04:02:32,440
says pointing a little way to the east what do you mean no matter they tell me i will get better

1533

i need to practice my third eye she says tapping what appears to be a small gem stuck to her forehead

1537
04:03:11,370 --> 04:03:17,739

1541
04:03:43,930 --> 04:03:55,829
game of magic but a game of inner sense but you can read minds that's unfair no no i am learning

1542

1550
04:05:46,780 --> 04:05:54,819
into a keyboard just like three or four words in a row and just pressing enter and it shows

1551
04:05:54,819 --> 04:06:01,530
up over here and it derails the stream for like 25 straight minutes you know what i mean think

1569
04:09:51,940 --> 04:09:59,000
to her feet i must be going travel well come and visit me if you will she waves in the direction

1570
04:09:59,000 --> 04:10:04,940
of the cliff you came down when you enter the backlands but quite why is not clear then she

1571
04:10:04,940 --> 04:10:14,010
hurries away the tree is relatively young fresh and strong as though it has been only planted a

1572
04:10:14,010 --> 04:10:20,139
few minutes before it is hard to believe this is the same tree that you saw before so tall and so

1573
04:10:20,139 --> 04:10:29,110
very dead but the position is the same with the woman gone you look around the plane south and

1574
04:10:29,110 --> 04:10:34,389
west the great fault line of the cliff shields out the sky and at its top it seems as dark as

1575
04:10:34,389 --> 04:10:40,629
night north the grass stretches away towards a distant flashing line that seems to cut across

1576
04:10:40,629 --> 04:10:58,840
the land you turn your attention back to the landscape sweet create a paradox all right so

1577
04:10:58,840 --> 04:11:14,780
where are we going back to the road let's go up north i'm gonna head north you walk on across the

1578
04:11:14,780 --> 04:11:20,379
grassland until you join an old road the sun is sinking and the sky is turning bruised purple

1579
04:11:20,379 --> 04:11:27,139
it will be night soon again already away from the road to the northeast the curious stone tower you

1580
04:11:27,139 --> 04:11:40,489
saw earlier stands alone overlooking the river towards the tower towards the tower the road

1581
04:11:40,489 --> 04:11:49,110
north uh go yeah the tower i we i'm gonna go to the tower because i want to show people something

1582
04:11:49,110 --> 04:11:55,190
interesting you step off the well-paved road and cut across the grassy fields that have somehow

1583
04:11:55,190 --> 04:12:01,020
replaced the plane that was here before the sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky soon it

1584
04:12:01,020 --> 04:12:06,950
will be dark you reach the shadow of the tower you spotted while climbing down the cliff its sides

1585
04:12:06,950 --> 04:12:13,510
are too smooth to be natural and that there are no stones or brickwork like a gigantic game piece

1586
04:12:13,590 --> 04:12:18,329
carved from a single block of stone thick gripweed curls up and around the tower like

1587
04:12:18,329 --> 04:12:31,139
wool round a bobbin beyond it a river pushes past look for a door tug the gripweed look at the river

1588
04:12:31,139 --> 04:12:41,530
what's available please my father the sweetest chef demands your opinions on cast iron or he

1589
04:12:41,530 --> 04:12:49,159
will flame you on twitter okay cast iron is a okay here's the thing about cast iron it's probably

1590
04:12:49,159 --> 04:12:53,959
the best cookware but it's kind of a pain in the ass and it's really heavy and it's annoying how

1591
04:12:53,959 --> 04:13:25,750
heavy it is to do dope to do zen if i had the jewel i don't can you put it in the dishwasher

1592
04:13:26,389 --> 04:13:35,129
i don't think so we can't hear you laugh anymore it gets cut off yeah i'll i'll eventually fix the

1593
04:13:35,129 --> 04:13:39,290
cut off thing i have no idea why that's happening that's what that's this mic problem that didn't

1594
04:13:39,290 --> 04:13:48,309
happen with the other mic so i gotta figure out why that's happening um what do i do what do i do

1595
04:13:48,389 --> 04:13:56,069
what do i do what do i do do do why don't you we're gonna cat look for a door you walk a full

1596
04:13:56,069 --> 04:14:03,319
circuit of the tower hoping to find a doorway but there is nothing to see the tower sides are made

1597
04:14:03,319 --> 04:14:11,510
of solid stone if indeed it is a tower on the very top something metal glints in the sunshine

1598
04:14:11,510 --> 04:14:17,450
listen now you agree well i think the mic sounds fine it's just sometimes i get cut off when i make

1599
04:14:17,450 --> 04:14:23,530
a loud screeching noise i think it sounds beautiful right now don't you agree don't you agree agree

1600
04:14:23,530 --> 04:14:38,459
with me don't you agree uh tug the gripweed you give the gripweed shoots a sharp tug the plant

1601
04:14:38,459 --> 04:14:45,510
is tough as rope and seems to be firmly anchored into the stone of the tower uh look at the glint

1602
04:14:46,069 --> 04:14:50,229
craning your neck and squinting against the sun you try to make out what the gleam is

1603
04:14:51,219 --> 04:14:57,610
some kind of brass fitting seems to jut out over the side strange to see worked metal and stone

1604
04:14:57,610 --> 04:15:05,719
out here wasn't this place supposed to be barren you pause for a while watching the river rushing

1605
04:15:05,719 --> 04:15:11,719
past the sound is calming even though it is on the far side that the plains continue then somehow

1606
04:15:11,719 --> 04:15:26,389
you must cross climb up climb the gripweed quickly you grab the gripweed and scramble up the outside

1607
04:15:26,389 --> 04:15:31,829
of the tower the roots of the thick plant offer plenty of footholds and the ascent is easy enough

1608
04:15:32,629 --> 04:15:39,209
soon you are hauling yourself over the battlements onto the top of the tower at the top of the tower

1609
04:15:41,430 --> 04:15:45,750
you stand atop the tower the wind across the prairie whips at your hood and the ground seems

1610
04:15:45,750 --> 04:15:55,540
like an endless green sea far below remember this game has screen shake don't interrupt me

1611
04:15:55,540 --> 04:16:02,020
but the top is not empty indeed there is barely room to stand most of the floor space is taken

1612
04:16:02,020 --> 04:16:10,069
up by a large brass contraption that has been built into the middle of the roof look at the

1613
04:16:10,069 --> 04:16:14,469
contraption in the tower this tower was clearly built to house the brass contraption in the center

1614
04:16:14,469 --> 04:16:21,270
of the turret you look it over with curious interest a large brass cylinder it is set into

1615
04:16:21,270 --> 04:16:27,639
the bearing in the center of the tower and protrudes a short way over the battlement it

1616
04:16:27,639 --> 04:16:33,930
is rather like one of the chief mages telescopes but why would anyone set such a complex device

1617
04:16:33,930 --> 04:16:43,540
out here in the wastes you crouch to look through the cylinder but find you cannot it has no eyepiece

1618
04:16:43,540 --> 04:16:49,659
the near end disappears unbroken into the brass mounting of the device the bearing underneath the

1619
04:16:49,659 --> 04:16:54,469
cylinder looks as though it might allow the contraption to move furthermore set in the

1620
04:16:54,469 --> 04:17:02,139
central dome is an impressive looking blue crystal the blue crystal is not a gem you recognize

1621
04:17:02,139 --> 04:17:10,760
it pulses with a small interior glow as though something lived inside you touch the crystal

1622
04:17:10,760 --> 04:17:15,719
but as your fingers brush the glass something happens and you feel yourself whipped up into

1623
04:17:15,719 --> 04:17:21,610
the air as though catapulted for a dizzy moment you seem to stare down at the entire land of

1624
04:17:21,610 --> 04:17:30,010
badubak then a moment later you're back on your feet head reeling but feeling curiously powerful

1625
04:17:30,010 --> 04:17:39,079
touch it again you reach out to touch the crystal again only to catch yourself the blue crystal on

1626
04:17:39,079 --> 04:17:44,440
the contraption is flashing brilliantly and then suddenly the cylinder ignites with a thick beam

1627
04:17:44,440 --> 04:17:49,020
of syrupy light the beam floods across the landscape cutting through the mists and warping

1628
04:17:49,020 --> 04:18:00,809
the view like a heat haze the land in the light of the beam has changed it seems the magic you

1629
04:18:00,809 --> 04:18:08,229
witnessed earlier is happening again birds wheel and tumble in the air a short distance away

1630
04:18:08,229 --> 04:18:16,729
ladies and gentlemen welcome to why this is the coolest potentially of the three episodes it is

1631
04:18:17,459 --> 04:18:32,379
two maps on top of each other one in the past and one in the present and you can traverse them

1632
04:18:32,379 --> 04:18:53,049
however you see fit get elden ringed so the question is where do i want to point this

1633
04:18:53,049 --> 04:19:03,190
down in the water over here to the bridge so i can cross over here straight down over against this

1634
04:19:03,190 --> 04:19:22,709
thing uh i could also make this back to normal what do you guys think the cave this is a flop

1635
04:19:22,709 --> 04:19:41,000
episode come on it's a flop well let's put it over here first right or we could try to cross it

1636
04:19:41,000 --> 04:19:47,780
without it without the water and without the bridge and aim it this way or go across here first and

1637
04:19:47,780 --> 04:20:03,190
try to get over there back in time cave cave cave cave all right we'll do the cave i'll point it back

1638
04:20:03,190 --> 04:20:12,100
here you adjust the beam around its track sweeping light over the land below the view is now partially

1639
04:20:12,100 --> 04:20:16,659
lit with the beam from the tower and a different land appears in its light birds fly gentle wind

1640
04:20:16,659 --> 04:20:27,940
stirs pollen in a haze the various towers across the game you aim them that's how you do it there

1641
04:20:27,940 --> 04:20:32,899
we go with the beacon blazing away you swing yourself over the battlement once more after an

1642
04:20:32,899 --> 04:20:40,620
uncertain moment you find the grip weed and clamor swiftly down back to the tower's base you scramble

1643
04:20:40,620 --> 04:20:47,610
down the tower and drop the last few feet to the ground and you leave south of here the grand road

1644
04:20:47,610 --> 04:20:56,219
runs from west to east across the plain so that is what we have opened back up is over here this

1645
04:20:56,219 --> 04:21:12,600
road is now back in time i think it was a thousand couple thousand years ago let's go back uh the

1646
04:21:12,600 --> 04:21:20,260
road west i think we can cross this now you return to the road night falls you should find somewhere

1647
04:21:20,260 --> 04:21:25,059
safe to sleep if you keep going through the night you'll be weaker for it especially after so long

1648
04:21:25,059 --> 04:21:32,979
walking with an empty belly uh i'm if i can make it i think i can hang out maybe in the cave

1649
04:21:33,700 --> 04:21:40,920
you abandon the road and walk across the suddenly grassy field the moon rises filling the world

1650
04:21:40,920 --> 04:21:47,100
with thin silver light you crest a low rise and look down across the grass offering something of

1651
04:21:47,100 --> 04:21:55,399
a view looking north a wide river splashes spray into the air south you can make out

1652
04:21:55,399 --> 04:22:01,180
elthera's tree and east the road makes a loop past the foothills of badobak ridge passing an

1653
04:22:01,180 --> 04:22:08,420
unusual double spiked rock formation and that's all there is to see so we're gonna head back

1654
04:22:08,420 --> 04:22:19,110
towards the cave and it's really really sweet all right here we go you make your slow way across

1655
04:22:19,110 --> 04:22:26,950
the virgin grassland this then is the pit of the backlands it is not as fearsome as you had expected

1656
04:22:26,950 --> 04:22:33,639
or maybe the sludge and grime of kare has toughened your resolve indeed in this strange magical light

1657
04:22:33,639 --> 04:22:39,700
it is almost pleasant east of the badobak ridge lie the clatterback steps which you must cross

1658
04:22:39,700 --> 04:22:50,309
to reach the lake return to the cliff once more you enter the shadow of the cliffs that surround

1659
04:22:50,309 --> 04:22:56,389
this place the stars are flooding the sky the grass meadow ends by the cliff base and the

1660
04:22:56,389 --> 04:23:03,290
carved stone steps that lead away from the backlands i do need to sleep you find an old fox

1661
04:23:03,290 --> 04:23:07,290
hole and scramble inside you've not eaten today but you have no rations so you're gonna have to

1662
04:23:07,290 --> 04:23:12,280
just deal with it you lie back and try to forget your troubles you're protected here

1663
04:23:12,280 --> 04:23:21,620
and your rest is untroubled by dream you gain considerable stamina and met shadrach the hermit

1664
04:23:21,620 --> 04:23:31,750
all right here we go you pull yourself out of your hole and stand up the grass meadow ends by the

1665
04:23:31,750 --> 04:23:37,540
cliff base and the carved stone steps that lead away from the backlands go up the steps you haul

1666
04:23:37,540 --> 04:23:47,100
yourself onto the first of the gigantic steps that leads up the cliff face halfway up it's been two

1667
04:23:47,100 --> 04:23:52,709
days and you're exactly where you started yep but just like a thousand years in the past you clamor

1668
04:23:52,709 --> 04:23:58,889
up the carved rock it is painstaking work as every step is about the height of your own body

1669
04:23:58,889 --> 04:24:06,229
then about halfway up you pause to rest near the entrance to a cave the cave is clearly inhabited

1670
04:24:06,229 --> 04:24:18,469
a cloth hangs across the opening let's go you push back the cloth hanging and enter the cave

1671
04:24:18,469 --> 04:24:28,469
inside welcome murmurs a voice from the shadows at the far end of the space who's there i am armed

1672
04:24:28,469 --> 04:24:36,840
or greetings don't we we know who lives here didn't l theorist say it was her cave i was

1673
04:24:36,840 --> 04:24:46,379
gonna say it um you're enabling him yeah i didn't say it who's there you call waiting for your eyes

1674
04:24:46,379 --> 04:24:52,979
to readjust so you can see you hear footsteps patting forward over sand and then a shambling

1675
04:24:52,979 --> 04:25:02,420
figure appears a woman with crazed white hair wearing rags of animal skin you i had no idea

1676
04:25:02,420 --> 04:25:08,100
i would see you again her voice is familiar from somewhere but you've not met anyone so old since

1677
04:25:08,100 --> 04:25:19,159
the witch above the waterfall in the shuman tanti hills do you know me of course you've not changed

1678
04:25:19,239 --> 04:25:26,889
a bit or i was so young i was rather in love with you as i recall wait with that she steps

1679
04:25:26,889 --> 04:25:31,909
forward once more coming into the thin moonlight at the entrance of the cave you gasp though this

1680
04:25:31,909 --> 04:25:38,780
woman is old beyond imagining you recognize her face it is l thera with whom you were playing

1681
04:25:38,780 --> 04:25:47,530
dice only hours before how is this possible you demand afraid of whatever curse had befallen her

1682
04:25:47,530 --> 04:25:55,579
she laughs it is this not normal where you come from with my people we change this way as time

1683
04:25:55,579 --> 04:26:03,270
passes it's quite normal how long ago did we meet you ask horrified by what the answer might be

1684
04:26:04,790 --> 04:26:14,180
when we met i was barely 16 and now let me see i suppose i am 113 if you don't count the year

1685
04:26:14,180 --> 04:26:22,260
i spent as an eagle she shrugs sadly but welcome all the same perhaps you are thirsty from a corner

1686
04:26:22,260 --> 04:26:31,510
of the cave she produces a jug which has been catching water dripping down the stone thank you

1687
04:26:31,510 --> 04:26:38,219
she pours you a cup and you drink gratefully and quickly feel thoroughly refreshed it's been

1688
04:26:38,219 --> 04:26:46,139
barely any time since i last met you can you tell me about the serpents do you have any provisions

1689
04:26:46,139 --> 04:27:00,229
how can i cross the backlands eagle fursona yeah the last time i met i was in oh yeah the last

1690
04:27:00,229 --> 04:27:08,200
time we were at that fur con and i was in my fucking eagle costume weren't you a gopher yeah

1691
04:27:08,200 --> 04:27:16,629
i was a gopher i thought i knew i knew you from somewhere uh all right can you uh it's been

1692
04:27:16,629 --> 04:27:23,719
barely let's get let's get some some lore here it's been barely any time since i last met you

1693
04:27:23,719 --> 04:27:31,180
well then the curse on this land affects me but not you perhaps you will be able to leave unlike

1694
04:27:31,180 --> 04:27:39,459
the others what others the others all the others that survive the new crown they wander the

1695
04:27:39,459 --> 04:27:51,370
wilderness and circle is lost endlessly repeating themselves quite unstuck any provisions uh i do

1696
04:27:51,370 --> 04:28:02,979
not eat i sustain myself through passive thought it is a pure existence can you train me if you

1697
04:28:03,059 --> 04:28:07,780
have 50 years to spend in practice but i do not have so long i fear

1698
04:28:10,090 --> 04:28:20,579
you're a sorcerer are you not i'm a student of magic she nods there is a secret known only to

1699
04:28:20,579 --> 04:28:26,309
the most powerful sorcerers in this land the sorcerers of the fortress know it i am sure

1700
04:28:26,309 --> 04:28:37,290
but they've tried to keep it a secret would you like to hear it yeah uh if there are nods in

1701
04:28:37,290 --> 04:28:44,540
return it is said you see that sorcery is unstoppable powerful the sorcerers tell us

1702
04:28:44,540 --> 04:28:52,090
that magic controls the world's very warp and weft that once woven a spell cannot be unwound

1703
04:28:52,090 --> 04:29:06,549
the claim is bold but i have learned it is also untrue magic can be undone magic some magic perhaps

1704
04:29:06,549 --> 04:29:14,649
all magic can be countered just as the parrying blade can stop a sword i have discovered one such

1705
04:29:14,649 --> 04:29:21,899
counter spell already the spell of the healing opposes the enchantment of the fireball i believe

1706
04:29:21,899 --> 04:29:28,540
if one can recognize the spell being cast and one knows the form then one can prevent that spell

1707
04:29:28,540 --> 04:29:37,909
with the cast of the other counter spells what about the most powerful spells i have not tested

1708
04:29:37,909 --> 04:29:44,170
it but yes perhaps even the most powerful spell can be undone as she speaks she draws a shape in

1709
04:29:44,170 --> 04:29:53,610
the air a horizontal line a diagonal another line it is the letter z interesting what does

1710
04:29:53,610 --> 04:30:03,700
z can you tell me about the serpents seven serpents suddenly her face is alive with activity

1711
04:30:03,700 --> 04:30:07,799
and she hobbles back into the depths of her cave returning a moment later clicking her fingers

1712
04:30:07,799 --> 04:30:13,770
i have seen this i have seen this in the stars about the seven serpents turns the fate of man

1713
04:30:13,770 --> 04:30:19,319
and about that turns the fate of the world i thought the seven serpents were stars

1714
04:30:19,319 --> 04:30:31,159
up there the seven serpents are real they are most powerful they're all but indestructible if you see

1715
04:30:31,159 --> 04:30:39,690
one of these serpents stranger i believe that you must run i have killed many serpents this is

1716
04:30:39,690 --> 04:30:56,889
definitely going in this voice acting sizzle reel true i have killed many serpents not such

1717
04:30:56,889 --> 04:31:03,260
as these each of the seven serpents is sliced from the head of a hydra each is bound to an

1718
04:31:03,260 --> 04:31:12,040
element of the world fire or air or earth or time she waves a hand that sort of thing and each only

1719
04:31:12,040 --> 04:31:20,790
has one weakness what weakness a different weakness in each serpent you must know them to kill them

1720
04:31:20,790 --> 04:31:27,940
but to know them is to be killed by them and the whole land turns on this so the whole land must

1721
04:31:27,940 --> 04:31:39,049
surely fall woman sits down quite suddenly in a state of some despair they all have pokemon

1722
04:31:39,049 --> 04:31:46,739
weaknesses yeah you approach her hoping to console her but she does not react to your presence she

1723
04:31:46,739 --> 04:31:55,239
does not even blink the woman murmurs softly to herself look around the cave you glance around

1724
04:31:55,239 --> 04:32:00,840
the cave althera has few possessions to speak of but your interest is taken more by the dust

1725
04:32:01,000 --> 04:32:09,180
that covers the floor stone dust can be very valuable for magic you scrape together a handful

1726
04:32:09,180 --> 04:32:13,819
is worth of stone dust between your palms and slip it into your money pouch for safe keeping

1727
04:32:13,819 --> 04:32:21,100
the woman's third eye seems to glow momentarily you step away from the old woman and look about

1728
04:32:21,100 --> 04:32:31,530
for where to go next then quite suddenly she grabs your leg but it will take some time to search

1729
04:32:31,530 --> 04:32:55,879
come back then her eyes roll up into her skull keep going stepping carefully past the catatonic

1730
04:32:55,879 --> 04:33:01,110
woman you make your way further into the back of the cave after a narrow passage it opens out to

1731
04:33:01,110 --> 04:33:08,409
reveal a wide space lit by a torchlight the walls are covered with scratched writing curious symbols

1732
04:33:08,409 --> 04:33:26,919
and glyphs all in the same shaky hand a little dust trickles from the ceiling be careful here

1733
04:33:26,919 --> 04:33:46,659
sus rock turn to stone how probably sus right yeah that's definitely play consulting the

1734
04:33:46,659 --> 04:33:52,169
constellations above you bind the spell and a quiet voice enters your mind it assures you

1735
04:33:52,169 --> 04:33:58,939
that the cave is quite safe and the woman who lives here can be trusted but it advises you

1736
04:33:58,939 --> 04:34:05,270
she will have nothing to tell you until long after she is dead that strange message delivered

1737
04:34:05,270 --> 04:34:12,650
the voice fades some of the glyphs on the walls are split you notice like cracked crazed cracks

1738
04:34:12,650 --> 04:34:20,869
in the stone you look more closely at the cracks in the walls it is as though the cliff itself is

1739
04:34:20,869 --> 04:34:26,740
slowly shearing apart one crack in particular spiders the ceiling and threatens to bring the

1740
04:34:26,740 --> 04:34:34,250
roof down looking more closely you see why it is filled with a seam of some soft metal

1741
04:34:34,250 --> 04:34:45,689
which is slowly wearing away intrigued by the writing you look over some symbols they're a

1742
04:34:45,689 --> 04:34:52,279
mixture of star signs letters numbers and shapes you do not recognize there's no order it is as

1743
04:34:52,279 --> 04:34:57,770
though their scribe was desperately trying to capture as much as possible of a dream before

1744
04:34:57,770 --> 04:35:03,189
it was forgotten the results are quite indecipherable especially in the near darkness

1745
04:35:03,189 --> 04:35:13,799
and barely any space is left only one patch of blank stone near the base of the wall um

1746
04:35:13,799 --> 04:35:32,330
probably sun get a closer look right it's free you wind the stars into order around you the

1747
04:35:32,330 --> 04:35:36,729
sun jewel starts to give off a magical white glow the glow picks out details in the glyphs

1748
04:35:36,729 --> 04:35:43,299
and carvings of the wall letting you read several more clearly the bridge will fall

1749
04:35:43,299 --> 04:35:56,380
and the river become a chasm reads one the blood candle must not be lit do not eat from the larder

1750
04:35:56,380 --> 04:36:09,669
of a frog okay sounds important uh look at the blank stone you squat down to look at the blank

1751
04:36:09,669 --> 04:36:15,590
stone but see nothing it is natural rock only remarkable because every other surface has been

1752
04:36:15,590 --> 04:36:22,950
etched or carved above the blank section is drawn a rude outline of a snake followed by a hand and

1753
04:36:22,950 --> 04:36:40,740
two vertical lines a son again will this kill us both dig out the metal seam you dig at the metal

1754
04:36:40,740 --> 04:36:45,479
seam with your sword it is worthless tin and comes away easily there's a noise like rumbling

1755
04:36:45,479 --> 04:36:51,419
thundering the stones above shift perceptively quickly you put your sword away before you bring

1756
04:36:51,419 --> 04:37:14,709
the rocks down on your head what else can i do summon darkness so why would i do that no rock

1757
04:37:14,709 --> 04:37:43,500
can do sun again uh what does this do you craft the spell and billows of black smoke emerge quickly

1758
04:37:43,500 --> 04:37:48,650
from under your cloak the back of the cave plunges into thick darkness the torch on the wall

1759
04:37:48,650 --> 04:37:58,549
disappearing completely from view you wait and after a few minutes the spell fades and the fog

1760
04:37:58,549 --> 04:38:07,529
dissipates once more it's there for no reason i may as well just have put my back up against a wall

1761
04:38:08,090 --> 04:38:17,509
standing straight up standing back flush to the wall heels against the wall head against the wall

1762
04:38:17,509 --> 04:38:24,090
and just tilt my head down and then throw it back fucking hard and hit my fucking head against the

1763
04:38:24,090 --> 04:38:32,970
wall i just did the set that's what i just did i did the same thing and then just leave i just

1764
04:38:32,970 --> 04:38:39,610
took damage for no reason all right you head back out of the cave avoiding a cascade of small stones

1765
04:38:39,610 --> 04:38:54,389
from a crack in the ceiling as you go you return from the rear of the cave the light from your sun

1766
04:38:54,389 --> 04:39:00,470
jewel pulses twice and fades althera is still here squatting in one corner and rocking quietly

1767
04:39:00,470 --> 04:39:09,270
what do the symbols on the walls of the cave mean she shakes her head too much to see not enough

1768
04:39:09,270 --> 04:39:49,799
space enough space okay um can i make the space bigger i'm going back here uh how can't do far

1769
04:39:52,860 --> 04:40:00,729
log i don't think this if i could i but i don't have the right turn to strike do it turn to stone

1770
04:40:05,430 --> 04:40:09,990
i wonder what this does how much stone dust do i have i don't want to waste it i mean i just

1771
04:40:09,990 --> 04:40:22,009
picked it up off of her ground i'm gonna use it here all right i get a rewind if it doesn't

1772
04:40:22,009 --> 04:40:34,979
do anything i'm gonna rewind if it doesn't do anything

1773
04:40:41,740 --> 04:40:45,580
reaching up to the stars you create the magic across a handful of stone dust

1774
04:40:45,659 --> 04:40:50,459
and you feel the potential of magic entering your palm you have a few seconds to decide what to do

1775
04:40:50,459 --> 04:41:01,740
with it toss the stone dust onto the metal in the crack or toss it into the air you toss the stone

1776
04:41:01,740 --> 04:41:06,700
dust at the soft metal that fills the stone crack it bonds instantly and soon the cracks themselves

1777
04:41:06,700 --> 04:41:12,470
have turned to stone healing the join whether this will be enough to protect althera's home

1778
04:41:12,470 --> 04:41:24,810
you cannot be sure is that a good thing was that good did i prevent her roof from caving in or

1779
04:41:24,810 --> 04:41:44,759
something i'm gonna live with that uh althera is still here lost in thought okay all right let's

1780
04:41:44,759 --> 04:41:54,919
get out of here the view below is quite giddying you're one step from plunging to the pit floor

1781
04:41:54,919 --> 04:42:06,790
okay so we can go we'll go up through here maybe maybe i'll should i go no i'm gonna go check this

1782
04:42:06,790 --> 04:42:16,060
out in the uh in the present uh this is this will be the present so we'll go up i could also come

1783
04:42:16,060 --> 04:42:35,130
back here in the present time let's do that uh move on so let's let's let's see what happens i'm

1784
04:42:35,130 --> 04:42:48,619
gonna take the thing away we'll go back again you carry on across the grassland enjoying the

1785
04:42:48,619 --> 04:42:54,060
soft chirping of the insects the mid-afternoon heat floods the valley from behind you a voice says

1786
04:42:54,060 --> 04:43:01,290
excuse me this happened already just ignore it you ignore it another mirage like the one you heard

1787
04:43:01,290 --> 04:43:10,139
before excuse me are you deaf all right you turn around to find a small boy holding a black face

1788
04:43:10,139 --> 04:43:27,130
mask in his hand he pushes it towards you where did you get that you dropped it the boy says

1789
04:43:27,130 --> 04:43:36,279
thank you you nod your head and thanks the boy smiles puts the face mask into your hands then

1790
04:43:36,279 --> 04:43:50,500
he steps back and waits for something um what do you want like a reward offer him a reward

1791
04:43:50,500 --> 04:44:04,569
you look in your pack for a suitable reward um here here's three gold okay the boy smile grows

1792
04:44:04,569 --> 04:44:11,540
wide at the site thank you by thruff i'm glad i followed you i mean that i was here you know

1793
04:44:11,619 --> 04:44:17,080
what i mean he puts the gold into his pocket you squat down onto your ankles to be more at

1794
04:44:17,080 --> 04:44:27,479
the boy's level he's clearly local and is likely to know a lot about the area where are you from

1795
04:44:27,479 --> 04:44:40,419
you ask the boy kare but i run errands all the way to tin pang sometimes where's tin pang across

1796
04:44:40,419 --> 04:44:45,880
the marsh over the bridge near the lake you can run there in almost a day the idea that this boy

1797
04:44:45,880 --> 04:44:53,299
can cross the entire of the backlands is startling this is the most dangerous land you know the boy

1798
04:44:53,299 --> 04:45:11,979
is starting to look twitchy what do you know of the seven serpents nothing sounds like one of

1799
04:45:11,979 --> 04:45:25,750
shadrach stories the boy hops from foot to foot so you know shadrach of course i do everyone knows

1800
04:45:25,750 --> 04:45:39,099
shadrach he's a brute and beats children if they make too much noise near his cave um he seems most

1801
04:45:39,099 --> 04:45:46,869
ferocious he hates children he says they're all thieves and villains i have to go now i have to

1802
04:45:46,869 --> 04:45:55,000
go where i'm going back home before they close the gates with a final nod he in the other direction

1803
04:45:55,000 --> 04:46:01,610
across the gates with a final nod he goes in the other direction across the grass it is only later

1804
04:46:01,610 --> 04:46:21,560
you realize he somehow swiped the claw well guess what why did you do that if you i that skull cap

1805
04:46:21,560 --> 04:46:30,700
is so important do we live with it and just not have the skull cap anymore do i have to live with

1806
04:46:30,700 --> 04:46:35,930
some of these things and he took three gold i gotta stop being nice to people and just if it

1807
04:46:35,930 --> 04:46:42,040
says punch in face immediately punch in face if it's just oh a punch person in face done punch

1808
04:46:42,040 --> 04:47:24,139
person in face i'm going this way yeah fuck that i'm going over here i know rewind rewind rewind

1809
04:47:24,139 --> 04:47:31,560
rewinds when he said he was from kare that should have hinted that he was a thief yeah that's true

1810
04:47:31,560 --> 04:47:37,529
i forgot i haven't played it in a while okay you carry on tramping across the endless waste and the

1811
04:47:37,529 --> 04:47:44,569
grass turns to dust as you go the mid-afternoon heat floods the valley the sunlight turns the

1812
04:47:44,569 --> 04:47:51,180
dust of the plane to a bitter yellow as you walk you come across an open area dotted with 20 or 30

1813
04:47:51,180 --> 04:48:14,520
small holes you pull a goblin tooth from your pack and throw it on the ground casting you spell

1814
04:48:14,520 --> 04:48:19,740
across it the tooth erupts into a column of smoke and a moment later a goblin warrior is standing

1815
04:48:19,740 --> 04:48:26,470
in front of you go investigate the holes you direct it to investigate the holes in the ground

1816
04:48:26,470 --> 04:48:33,659
it salutes waddles over to the nearest and peers down a moment later a jet of hot steam vents

1817
04:48:33,659 --> 04:48:40,279
through the earth knocking the goblin high up into the air it howls in pain as it flies up and then

1818
04:48:40,279 --> 04:48:46,840
winks out of existence a moment later the jet also knocks something free from the hole which you

1819
04:48:46,840 --> 04:48:55,400
pick up it is a single polished giant's tooth with a hole drilled at the top part of a pendant perhaps

1820
04:48:55,400 --> 04:49:02,470
you pick it up and put it in your pack a flash of something catches your eye but by the time you

1821
04:49:02,470 --> 04:49:15,259
turn your head whatever it was has gone uh uh well i nice job goblin i ain't looking in the holes

1822
04:49:15,259 --> 04:49:37,319
that not doing that gob for yob got an extra tooth all right onto the bridge the sun is beginning

1823
04:49:37,319 --> 04:49:42,680
to lower the air begins to cool you journey across the open plane approaching a curious

1824
04:49:42,680 --> 04:49:48,790
black stroke that seems to have been drawn across the land as you get closer you see it for what it

1825
04:49:48,790 --> 04:49:55,849
is a gash in the land thousands of fathoms deep the road comes to a stop at the edge of a wide

1826
04:49:55,849 --> 04:50:01,220
fissure in the ground and the ruins of an ancient bridge the wind roars along the crack in the ground

1827
04:50:01,220 --> 04:50:12,680
in front of you like a mockery of a river look down into the crevice you creep to the edge of

1828
04:50:12,680 --> 04:50:18,040
the crack to look down into it it seems to drop for miles besides plunging like a waterfall of rock

1829
04:50:18,040 --> 04:50:28,599
the bottom is lost in mist and the rock walls seem quite sheer i wonder what will happen

1830
04:50:28,599 --> 04:50:35,799
oh look at the bridge there was once a bridge here the road runs up to it and a few stones push out

1831
04:50:35,799 --> 04:50:40,979
over the yawning abyss but as long ago tumbled into ruin and now it does nothing but give you

1832
04:50:40,979 --> 04:50:46,779
an impressive place to look down suddenly you see movement at the edge of the fissure

1833
04:50:46,779 --> 04:50:52,060
some kind of long spike reaches up over the edge bends and hooks into the ground closely followed

1834
04:50:52,060 --> 04:51:19,779
by another whatever it is kill it a nap speed stench talk all languages all right we're going

1835
04:51:19,779 --> 04:51:29,000
to toss we're going to talk all languages it's an earwig grabbing the wig from your pack you pull

1836
04:51:29,000 --> 04:51:34,009
it onto your head and weave your spell but nothing happens this spell works only on intelligent

1837
04:51:34,009 --> 04:51:38,409
creatures and not animals wait wait no no no no no go back i want to talk i want to talk to the

1838
04:51:38,409 --> 04:51:57,770
earwig i actually i really genuinely i want to talk to the earwig okay okay okay all right it's

1839
04:51:57,770 --> 04:52:09,400
not it's uh it's a different spell yap is all talk with animals there we go not languages yap

1840
04:52:16,060 --> 04:52:20,919
grabbing the wig from your pack you pull it onto your head and weave your spell the creatures

1841
04:52:20,919 --> 04:52:28,090
clicking legs and rubbing jaws are suddenly transformed into words soft flesh don't run from

1842
04:52:28,090 --> 04:52:36,650
me come to me i am beautiful as it talks the creature keeps coming it is a long six-legged

1843
04:52:36,650 --> 04:52:43,509
bug with hooked jaws and a deadly looking sting the size of the one you sliced from the back of

1844
04:52:43,509 --> 04:52:54,709
the manticore only days ago so just run run for it you waste no time but turn tail and run but

1845
04:52:54,709 --> 04:53:01,000
the creature whatever it is is out of the crack and the ground and coming for you well i wanted

1846
04:53:01,000 --> 04:53:10,220
to go back here anyway i wanted to go this way anyways you hurry your way down the old road and

1847
04:53:10,220 --> 04:53:16,389
the bug scuttles along behind you running along inside the inside of the fissure to keep up

1848
04:53:16,389 --> 04:53:21,080
it must be able to run much faster than you across the rock as it appears a moment later

1849
04:53:21,080 --> 04:53:27,430
directly before you jaws wide open the creature raises its long sharpened jaws and seems to

1850
04:53:27,430 --> 04:53:33,479
thicken its armor plated hide you steal your courage at the site this is a lynch bug a ferocious

1851
04:53:33,479 --> 04:53:53,669
creature that will be hard to defeat in battle it climbs inside of your ear yeah i could do law

1852
04:53:53,669 --> 04:54:10,490
fireball i don't have access to jig wall i'll do law law is expensive but it usually works really

1853
04:54:10,490 --> 04:54:21,060
well you weave the constellations into a pattern around you reaching out to take control of the

1854
04:54:21,060 --> 04:54:28,200
lynch bug's thoughts its legs lock up and it stiffens it is waiting for your instructions

1855
04:54:28,200 --> 04:54:40,709
walk the bug into the fissure or ride the bug's back ride the bug you bring the bug close to you

1856
04:54:40,709 --> 04:54:47,369
and clamor up onto its back it is uncomfortable but affords a tremendous view of the landscape

1857
04:54:47,369 --> 04:54:55,689
order the bug across the fissure or ride the bug south we gotta go go across right you order the

1858
04:54:55,689 --> 04:55:02,360
bug northwards to the edge of the fissure and ready it to jump but although you control the

1859
04:55:02,360 --> 04:55:08,419
creature's will you cannot override its most basic instincts instead of jumping the fissure

1860
04:55:08,419 --> 04:55:15,060
it leans out over the side and begins to climb down the rock face into the depths of the canyon

1861
04:55:15,060 --> 04:55:22,250
hold on you cling onto the bug's antenna for life as it turns vertical there's no way to get off

1862
04:55:24,790 --> 04:55:33,590
oh god down the canyon side the bug continues it's inexorable climb down the canyon side

1863
04:55:33,590 --> 04:55:40,139
it is approaching a large gray brown mucusy something built onto the side of the rock wall

1864
04:55:40,139 --> 04:55:47,450
it's a lynch bug nest and as you approach you see it is crawling with hundreds more lynch bugs the

1865
04:55:47,450 --> 04:55:55,880
thought occurs to you that these ones will not be under the influence of your spell uh should i hide

1866
04:56:01,900 --> 04:56:11,610
order to climb up or crouch low against the sides go in the hive and hang out that's kind of funny

1867
04:56:11,610 --> 04:56:18,169
all right i'm gonna crouch you hunch low against the lynch bug shell hoping to perhaps go unnoticed

1868
04:56:18,169 --> 04:56:26,779
meanwhile the bug reaches the nest and squirms its way in through a tight sticky entrance way

1869
04:56:26,779 --> 04:56:34,119
inside the nest everything falls into darkness except for the echoing clicks of a hundred

1870
04:56:34,119 --> 04:56:48,259
thousand lynch bugs and they're young this is fucked should i pray to the ape or just wait

1871
04:56:48,259 --> 04:56:59,130
but wait you cling on and wait the bug squirms along a narrow passage almost scraping you off

1872
04:56:59,130 --> 04:57:10,040
its back there's nothing you can do but wait the bug enters a wide chamber presumably burrowed deep

1873
04:57:10,040 --> 04:57:22,650
into the rock itself you hear these sounds you're in a wide chamber chewed out from the rock of the

1874
04:57:22,650 --> 04:57:30,729
canyon wall and the center sprawls the vast corpulent body of the lynch bug queen your spell

1875
04:57:30,810 --> 04:57:46,409
has now entirely worn off uh it's the time for the ape to come and help wait you hold on

1876
04:57:46,409 --> 04:57:55,990
hoping against hope for some means of escape the bug you are riding bows low to its queen

1877
04:57:55,990 --> 04:58:04,139
and one of her majesty's 300 eyes settles on you she reaches out a clawed limb and strokes

1878
04:58:04,139 --> 04:58:14,700
the side of your cheek we have to bow bow to her you bow your head low to the queen's gaze

1879
04:58:14,700 --> 04:58:20,409
but you cannot tell if she understands the gesture the queen raises two of her arms and

1880
04:58:20,409 --> 04:58:26,970
intones a few words a moment later the clicks and rubbing of her front legs transforming

1881
04:58:27,529 --> 04:58:46,490
impossibly into human speech greetings you are the anilander uh i um what if that's bad no

1882
04:58:48,520 --> 04:59:00,810
um i am you reply surprised by this turn of events good my enchantment will not last long

1883
04:59:02,180 --> 04:59:09,340
you stare in disbelief the queen's raised arms make it clear what is happening she has cast a spell

1884
04:59:09,340 --> 04:59:19,080
a variant of the rap spell no doubt um your majesty is most powerful should i cast something

1885
04:59:19,080 --> 04:59:25,819
what can i do if this bug can cast a spell then that must mean you are able to as well

1886
04:59:25,819 --> 04:59:33,619
you raise your arms to the stars only to have them pinned by the lynch bug you rode on i am pleased

1887
04:59:33,619 --> 04:59:47,080
you have come i have expected hold on let's do this i am pleased you have come i expected my drone

1888
04:59:47,080 --> 05:00:04,630
to eat you by accident your drone was sent to get me i am pleased it did not as am i but you are the

1889
05:00:04,630 --> 05:00:15,860
one the serpent slayer of legend serpents what do you mean what do you mean serpents you ask

1890
05:00:15,860 --> 05:00:24,869
wondering at what this creature knows the seven serpents of the archmage from an orifice in my

1891
05:00:24,869 --> 05:00:33,930
underbelly i'm going to pull out a claw and a gob of goo this is monarch oil smeared upon the serpent

1892
05:00:33,930 --> 05:00:42,220
of water that swims in lake il klala and it will shrivel like a burned creature she drops the goo

1893
05:00:42,220 --> 05:00:53,270
into your hands holy shit really uh thank you you nod and place the goo into your pack the queen

1894
05:00:53,270 --> 05:01:03,380
clashes together her antenna which you understand as a nod one more thing do not forget there her

1895
05:01:03,380 --> 05:01:11,220
remaining words are lost into clicks and scrapes and wet squirts as her spell fades no i gotta

1896
05:01:11,220 --> 05:01:23,939
remember do remember what your majesty i can't cast all right i'm gonna i'm gonna bow once more

1897
05:01:23,939 --> 05:01:29,189
you bow your head to the queen the lynch bug who brought you here scoops you up and clamors out of

1898
05:01:29,189 --> 05:01:42,330
the nest that's pretty cool where the fuck are we oh it marks it on the map um i gotta be really

1899
05:01:42,330 --> 05:01:54,729
honest with you i don't think i've ever seen that that's the first time i've ever seen that

1900
05:01:54,729 --> 05:02:07,720
i've never seen that happen that was cool all right out of the out of the fissure the bug clamors

1901
05:02:07,720 --> 05:02:14,119
up over the canyon's edge and drops you into the dirt with a final nod it turns and strides away

1902
05:02:14,119 --> 05:02:19,240
call a thank you you call out a thank you to the bug but it is already gone you look around once

1903
05:02:19,240 --> 05:02:25,130
more a few birds swoop in and wheel in the crevice turning circles that are way below you and yet

1904
05:02:25,130 --> 05:02:35,560
still high up in the air we got earwig friends right that was cool all right um we gotta see i

1905
05:02:35,560 --> 05:02:51,669
i'm gonna jump across this right this makes the most sense to me or uh teleport but i don't have

1906
05:02:51,669 --> 05:03:02,009
the item um create a force field i guess i get hurt floating is definitely it makes the absolute

1907
05:03:02,009 --> 05:03:09,340
most sense look you cast the spell lightening your body weight to the mere fraction of normal

1908
05:03:09,340 --> 05:03:15,189
jump you eye up the width of the gap cautiously it is a long distance made harder to judge by the

1909
05:03:15,189 --> 05:03:19,830
featurelessness of the far side you'll probably be unable to make it at least not without aid

1910
05:03:19,830 --> 05:03:26,970
so taking a short run up you race for the edge of the fissure and hurl yourself out into space

1911
05:03:26,970 --> 05:03:32,200
your feather lightweight means you hardly fall but it also means the speed of your run-up is

1912
05:03:32,200 --> 05:03:40,020
quickly lost you fall gently and calmly for a long long way into the featureless chasm

1913
05:03:40,020 --> 05:03:45,259
then with no warning the spell ends and you speed up nothing else happens for some time

1914
05:03:45,259 --> 05:03:53,369
and then when finally something does occur it is mercifully brief so i wily coyoted off the edge

1915
05:03:53,369 --> 05:04:11,590
come on how far is this chasm all right well i think this gotta be a way to get over there

1916
05:04:11,590 --> 05:04:17,060
i could fix the bridge with the tower there's no way for me to get over there from here

1917
05:04:19,450 --> 05:04:30,580
cause slowness i have an idea i'll cast slowness on myself you cast you cast the enchantment but

1918
05:04:30,580 --> 05:04:35,139
without any other creatures around the only target is yourself you feel no different once the spell

1919
05:04:35,139 --> 05:04:42,709
is taken hold but the clouds overhead seem to double their haste jump across you eye up the

1920
05:04:42,709 --> 05:04:49,020
width you're probably unable to make it without a let's go taking a short slow motion run-up

1921
05:04:49,099 --> 05:04:56,439
you stride for the edge of the fissure and hurl yourself out into space the chasm whisks away

1922
05:04:56,439 --> 05:05:03,909
below you at a comical speed and the wind that batters at you is not enough to slow you down

1923
05:05:03,909 --> 05:05:11,349
a moment later you collide into the ground on the far side in a pile of scratches and scrapes what

1924
05:05:11,349 --> 05:05:29,610
