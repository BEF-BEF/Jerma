1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:15,849
Hey, what's going on everybody? Uh, Jerma here with a Terraria gameplay. Hi! Uh, we're gonna finish

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:25,079
Terraria tonight, today. Knew that was coming. Yeah, I'm pretty predictable. Uh, we're gonna finish

3
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:32,380
Terraria. At least the base game, Star and I. Uh, this is, might be a shorter stream. I wouldn't

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,500
lock yourself in like the last couple streams for eight hours or so. We're gonna finish the game,

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,579
chill, and see what happens after that. We'll see. I will give an update on the activity book,

6
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,899
which has been pushed because obviously I wanted more time people to do stuff. We'll talk about

7
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:58,250
that after Terraria. Gonna be a chill stream. I think he's trying to talk to me, but I told him

8
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:09,900
I do a full five minute broadcaster intro. I can see the thing lighting up on, uh, on Discord. He's

9
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:19,590
trying to talk to me. What is it? I saw your thing lighten up. I thought you were trying to

10
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,469
get a hold of me. Oh no, I was talking to the people and telling them that it feels like I

11
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:30,329
threw my left arm out, but I haven't used my left arm for like a year, so I don't know what's wrong.

12
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:35,290
Sleep on it wrong? And then you told me to take some glycycerols. That's not what I said.

13
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:45,219
Hypoglycerin? No, that's not correct. That's incorrect. What did you tell me? I told you.

14
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:53,180
Glucosamine and chondroitin. Oh, what does that do? Where do I get it? You get it anywhere.

15
00:01:54,379 --> 00:02:00,260
It's good for your joints. It's good for your cartilage. Oh, it's not even that. My chat's

16
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:07,349
telling me it's cancer. I don't think I would just always take care of your health. It's important.

17
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:20,060
For your health. But we're going to beat this game. Are we? Yeah. Didn't you tell me this is

18
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,460
going to be like... Are you stuck in the room? No, I'm doing my intro. No, you're stuck in the room.

19
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,740
What do you mean stuck in the room? You're stuck in the room. You'll know when you get to the game.

20
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:42,490
I'm in the game. You're stuck in the room. How did I get in here? I don't know. Well, I know how to

21
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:49,419
get out. You would destroy that house for your own gain. You're free. You're free. Get out quick.

22
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,449
This is your chance to get out. He's a fucking monster. Get out quick.

23
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:07,819
Yeah, that's why I cut their ears off. You're a sick fuck. All right. So where do we go from here?

24
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:12,939
What was the last thing we did three years ago? Where are we? I don't know. Last thing I remember

25
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:19,819
is you built an entire teleporting around town tunnel system. Oh, yeah. Hey, welcome to episode

26
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:24,699
number 74 of Let's Play Terraria. I built these teleporter pads to give us a little bit of an

27
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:29,180
easier time getting around. You just stand on top of the teleporter and you right click the switch.

28
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:35,400
Hey, look, and we're at the dungeon. This is actually the next boss. Oh, nice. So I helped

29
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,520
with this if anyone's curious. Oh, yeah. Jerma did this one. He gets full credit. I was about

30
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,960
placement. I was saying, hey, we should probably put them in different places. I looked up some

31
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,319
stuff about Terraria. I wanted to be prepared for this stream. So I said some of the teleporters

32
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,000
should be in front of the new bosses. Some should be in other areas that are involved in the plot

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,680
of the game too. So we can see the story play out the plot. Yeah, the plot. What's the plot so far?

34
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:15,689
Just to catch everyone up. So you get dropped off outside. Are we going to fight it? We're going to

35
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:24,420
and when you dropped off outside, there's you have to use an island situation, I think.

36
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,079
Yeah, because this is an island, right? I mean, it could be. It could be. I mean, the whole goal is

37
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,160
we're just trying to figure out why we're here and how to get out. Yeah. And you have to build

38
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,740
the spaceship to get off. Yes. Because we're about halfway done with the spaceship. But first,

39
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:49,300
we need to kill the cultists while the Martians invade. OK. OK, that will make this harder.

40
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,529
Oh, I remember this. Remember when I went, whoa, what the fuck, dude,

41
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:09,930
something just happened, man. So it's been like three weeks since we last played.

42
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,889
How do you keep asking? Like, oh, my God, I clicked out of the window.

43
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:19,300
You keep asking, like, when are we done? OK, well, we kill this boss and then there's one

44
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,579
more and then we're done. So hopefully we can end this stream in 20 minutes because this.

45
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:33,579
What do you mean ended in 20 minutes? I think that's what the fans want. Oh, shit. Let's heal.

46
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:40,139
I got it. H. I mean, I've played this game before. Am I missing him?

47
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:50,730
I know you guys are your guys are all getting them. All right. He's almost at 28 percent. I see.

48
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:59,879
He's up. He's that one. Oh, I can feel the DPS. Three percent, one percent dots.

49
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:07,670
Game's over. We didn't do this. No, what's here? Here's what here's what you're going to look at.

50
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,870
You press anything on the map. Yeah. Uh huh. You see on the on the top of the map,

51
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,829
there's these icons for the nebula pillar. There's these different pillars.

52
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,790
Actually, there's one in our base. Everyone's dead again. Everyone's dead.

53
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:28,490
Huh? And we go home and everyone will be dead. That's just a fact because the pillar spawned

54
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,730
on our base. Once we destroy all four of those pillars, you immediately fight the final boss

55
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:46,360
and then we're done. It doesn't take like a while. It could take a very long time to do this.

56
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,910
You know, got any like side tracking stories and like what happened moments

57
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,829
we could do while we dig down for an hour and 25 minutes? Well, they're supposed. Oh,

58
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:00,389
actually the Martians are also at our base. Here's let's say let's take this teleporter

59
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,819
if you're ready for like pure chaos. Is it going to be pure chaos? Uh, if you fly higher than like

60
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:16,490
six feet, you'll die. What? Because of this pillar. Just on that. There's these things that fly around

61
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:28,920
in the sky that don't want you to fly. Oh, okay. Going good. So don't jump in the air.

62
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:37,610
You see like the worms in the sky? They like one shot you if you go too high. Oh, God. What if I

63
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:50,569
I don't know what fucking heal is. Turma. Turma. I tried Z. What if I rebounded like a month ago

64
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:58,759
and I don't even remember what the fuck I bound it to. Oh, God. That is over here, isn't it? That's

65
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:12,439
scary. So, oh, and the Martians. So what do we need to focus on here? After you kill like I think

66
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:20,149
it's 150 of the solar enemies, then you can destroy the pillar. You kill 150 enemies? Yeah.

67
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,769
Mage one trick the wizard. What the fuck?

68
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:38,809
Okay. Mage one trick the wizard. Is one trick their nickname? I don't know. Apparently,

69
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:45,289
he's only good at being a mage. I mean, that would be good enough for me. Get out of here. Get out

70
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:59,029
of our base. And as soon as we destroy the pillar, like a UFO is gonna show up.

71
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:10,299
I don't even know what's happening. Dude, I'm about to drive through today.

72
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,779
You never believe what happened. What happened at this drive? I had this dream.

73
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:32,539
I had this dream that I was at the drive through. Just so you get the full terraria experience.

74
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:38,149
I'll let you pick those up. Yeah. What is it? What is it? I'll allow it. Pick up what?

75
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:43,669
Where the pillar was, there's a whole bunch of solar fragments and they wow, dude. Wow. Do they

76
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:47,110
sure? Do they craft some stuff? Actually, can't we not do that yet? Because they don't have the

77
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:53,830
ancient manipulator. Well, I mean, to be fair, you did like delete a mod or two from the game,

78
00:09:53,830 --> 00:10:04,549
so I don't even know some items don't exist anymore. I'm getting like chunk errors.

79
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:18,779
Are you though? Yeah, I am. No, I'm picking them up. You guys thought that was a joke. No,

80
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:27,980
I have like errors in my inventory. Well, German didn't summon all these Martians.

81
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:40,740
And some angels. Oh, yeah. Oh, he's playing the playing the fool. I see. What the hell is it?

82
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:53,610
What is this thing? Where does this teleporter go to? Which one? The one that's like underneath

83
00:10:53,610 --> 00:11:03,000
the Marsha. All right. There's the saucer. OK, attention span for that teleporter gone.

84
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,799
One of them goes down to the midway point of all the shitty NPCs and the other one goes all the

85
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:17,740
way down to hell. Oh, you really did like do all of that, huh? Yeah. And then one of them goes to

86
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:28,940
the jungle and one of them goes to the dungeon. Game's over. Not yet. First, we have to kill

87
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:53,269
Naruto and then Bardo comes for revenge. Oh, a lot of help. Watch out for this UFO. I see it.

88
00:11:54,230 --> 00:12:06,200
Watch out for the UFO. Close the door. Let my minions do it.

89
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:17,610
I want to fight. Was that with UFO? OK, by you. It's dead. Nice work. Dang.

90
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:24,820
Oh, there's a bunch in the background. You can shoot those for me.

91
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:35,429
All the UFOs in the background? Yeah. Dude, this is like just I'm burning so much

92
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:40,389
mana with this weapon. I need to get rid of this thing. It's good. But did you did you get the

93
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,929
the ice frost summon staff that I told you to get a good boy?

94
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,690
Before the screen started, I was like, hey, German, you're going to need to get this.

95
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,610
It's very good at this stage of the game. I've got the frost staff on right now.

96
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,519
Use it.

97
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:10,120
Oh, they're all dead. No, they're not. Oh, I thought it was going to drop by everybody.

98
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,840
What's not fighting me? What's it doing? It's over here trying to shoot me desperately.

99
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,320
It's dead. All right, we got it. Is there going to be another one? There's two.

100
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,639
This one is smarter. It's holding down left mouse button. They don't understand.

101
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:39,370
Get the car key. Yeah, get the car key. I got a swimmer. That guy, he knows what he's talking about.

102
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:49,820
I got a key. All right. Use the car key. Do I get to go? Wait, you tell me I get to fly

103
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:58,940
and get the fly in a car. You stole an UFO. Well, hold on. Once he's done,

104
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:27,139
he just spawned right on top of those. Oh, whoa. He just one hit killed me with that.

105
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,210
Yeah, that does a lot of damage. Now, you know, it's for next time. All right.

106
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:40,149
For next time. Yeah, because we're starting a new run, right? It's been a while since we last

107
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:44,149
played. I think it's just better off we start from the beginning. I already have 380 health.

108
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:53,370
Oh, yeah, there's in the storage, there's life fruits and you should be able to get to 400.

109
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,090
I don't remember because I took off the mod where we died.

110
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,950
How did I just click out of the window? Why is that possible?

111
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:11,340
I feel like I'm getting hit and it takes me like two hits to die here.

112
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:19,539
That shouldn't be happening, right? Well, you do have summoner armor, so maybe

113
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:28,120
that's that's kind of is what happens, but it's unfortunate, but my summons are so cool

114
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:38,179
that it's worth it. There's so much random shit on the ground. I don't know what any of

115
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:55,720
this does, but I'm going to get it. I guess the there's like, use, use your UFO. Okay. Well,

116
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:05,129
hold on. Are we safe or where's that car key? Okay. Cosmic car key summons a rideable UFO.

117
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:12,759
Yeah, use your UFO. I'm going to keep saying it until you laugh. So like just laugh and get it

118
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:26,740
over with. Oh, what a nice UFO. Wow. This is last forever? Yeah. Really? Yeah. So I just get to be

119
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,580
Bowser the rest of the game. This is great. All right. I'm never taking this off. You can't drop

120
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:40,409
any Koopas though. That's all right. I'm never coming out of this seat. I'm going to be like

121
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,370
fucking crank for the remaining times we played this game. All right. What about your old

122
00:16:46,090 --> 00:17:01,129
case? It's a mouth slot. What does it blessed apple unicorn? It's not a UFO. So who cares?

123
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:05,690
That's true. All right. This is important though. There's a lot of so many things that are

124
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:17,990
overwhelming my brain. All right. I'm going to get um, is the staff anti-gravity anti-gravity hook?

125
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:24,309
Does that ring a bell? Anti-gravity hook. I think it's just a hook. Is it a cool hook? Is it better

126
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,470
than what I think I have? It's the one I think I have. I don't know what I think you have.

127
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:44,380
Come on. I can't get in here. Bullshit. Let me, let me do this. Where's Mr. Craft?

128
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,220
The German has finished telling the dream. What dream? I don't even remember you saying

129
00:17:48,220 --> 00:18:00,940
there was a dream. Alpha ray and two wingman, 15 dark sun fragments, a genesis and a galactica

130
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:12,140
singularity. Yeah. Damn it. I can't do that. I already told the dream story. I told the whole,

131
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:19,900
I had like three, I had a full dream thing like two days ago. I already told it. Oh, I was doing

132
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,619
a, I was like running like the previously on German nine eight five, like two or three streams

133
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:33,740
ago. All right. Let me do the thing that I always do. And that is just, I don't care.

134
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,779
Tell dream or riot. I'm sorry. I have to, I just, that's what I do. I deposit all.

135
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,079
I mean, at this point, at this point, who gives a shit doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. And I gotta

136
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:52,900
say, I played, I told you, I played through a game with Ashley and she really wasn't better than you

137
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,529
about sticking random shit right in the storage. I thought she knew better. And yet we had like

138
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:08,009
40 slots filled with banners. Look, we don't know what's good and not good. We just want to make

139
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:18,140
sure that we have everything we have at all. All right. Did anything, what was I trying to do?

140
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,920
I was trying to make something. I'm trying to make something for

141
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:31,220
someone's, the legendary valor for to assault enemies and blow them away.

142
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,849
Well, you're going to want the legendary valor for what the fuck is the valor for

143
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,940
what the fuck? I didn't know I had this guy. It's a Pokemon. I think I gave that to you.

144
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,420
Why can I, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a summoner. Why can I not have like five of these?

145
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,779
I think it's only one for that one item. I told you to get the, the ice frost thing from this guy.

146
00:19:52,579 --> 00:20:05,539
Look from, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Get the ice frost. I'm not the cryogenic frost cryogenic staff.

147
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:15,160
I need some money. I got plenty of that. Like 20 platinum in there. Okay. Is this better than my,

148
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:23,269
is this better than my like Lovecraftian guys? Someone's an animated ice concert to protect you

149
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:32,660
fire and why do I know what, why do I want this annoying cryogenic staff? Yeah. So I have to

150
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:45,740
reroll this because it sucks. All right. Okay. So whenever you want to, whenever you want to beat

151
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:54,740
hurtful cryogenic staff, let's go. Fuck. I said, I wasn't going to make that a thing on the channel

152
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:03,500
and it's like too late. So what the fuck is this? This is, this is like, this is not a summon. It's

153
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:12,759
a century. I like all this stuff. This is cool. This thing takes too much mana. I don't like it.

154
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:19,240
I'll like have to switch to it randomly. I do like this thing though. All right.

155
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:33,000
Um, I'm ready to do whatever you want to do. I know. Let me get all my summons and let's replace

156
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:43,450
this. Then I could go, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. Okay. All right. What do I got for potions?

157
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:51,259
32, 14. Oh, where's the, uh, you said there was, um, something to heal me to give me more health or

158
00:21:51,259 --> 00:22:04,220
something more max health. Is there something in the inventory? Oh, I pressed the letter L so I

159
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:12,329
muted. I'm sorry. Um, what's the, uh, in the inventory? What? Uh, you said there was something

160
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:18,519
in the inventory. I said there was something in the inventory for max health. Oh, life fruits,

161
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:29,190
life fruit. So I just take, take all this. I can just take all these you're saying I'm going to

162
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:40,549
take them all. I'm eating all the fruit. Is that all right with you? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Use them.

163
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:53,529
Oh, why is it not working? Don't throw it. Oh yeah. Good job. Way to go. Take one first.

164
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,769
You're looking healthier already, buddy. You muted again. How is that possible? I didn't press L.

165
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,170
Well, you know what? You know, if you don't want to talk to me, that's fine. I need to have 400

166
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:12,839
health to be able to eat these. Oh, you need life crystals? I think because I turned off the other

167
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:18,599
goofy thing. You turned off the mod. See? Okay. There's, there's 23 life crystals in here. You,

168
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:26,089
you've got it. Oh, it's cause I'm pressing L. Yeah. I'm pressing L for life crystal.

169
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:37,289
Oh, that's, that's funny. All right. So take these. Now I'm at 400. Can I? All right. Now take these.

170
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:45,940
There we go. That's better. That's what I'm talking about there. I'm good. I'm ready to go.

171
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,940
Ready to go beat the game. I'm ready. It's ready to go beat the game. That's it.

172
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:57,349
Okay. On the map, let's uh, hey, hey, let's use the new teleporter system. Wait, I want potions.

173
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:17,480
Where's the potion guy? Is the potion guy dead? Is it Howard? It's Howard, right? No.

174
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:27,140
I don't think the potion guy's alive. Hold on. I think there's a different one

175
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,579
because I got a better potion mod, but I think he's like way downstairs. Oh, did you move somebody?

176
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:48,309
Getting to the bottom of this. You made all these teleporters on my instructions, of course,

177
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:52,069
but you made these teleporters and I don't think you remember what you did.

178
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:04,859
You talking shit? Yeah. All right. I'll just delete the teleporter. He thinks he's at the end.

179
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:15,509
Oh, hello. You think we care for him or not? I didn't, I didn't talk about, but it's like funny.

180
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,549
So like a few weeks ago when we were trying to figure out like, hey, when do you want to do this

181
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:27,210
again? You had already played through like a full another time, like on expert. Yep. Me and me and

182
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:34,329
Ashley, we had a, we had a hankering for some more Terraria and we played on Revengeance Expert and

183
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:39,849
beat like the whole thing. And then it like that same week, he was supposed to play Terraria with

184
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:45,529
me on like baby mode. And you were like, do you still like want to do this? And I'm like, yeah.

185
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:48,650
You're like, you sure like, you don't want to like, you're not sick of that or anything. And I'm like,

186
00:25:48,650 --> 00:26:05,769
no, I like this game. Fun. Well, you know what? Yeah. I don't know if the NPCs on didn't yet

187
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:11,190
with the potions. This is good because I can't die. I can no longer die from fall damage. So what?

188
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:21,180
I don't have potions, whatever. Screw it. Let's go. Have you played Super Mario RPG?

189
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:29,559
Uh, a long time ago. Stream it tomorrow. Oh, that teleporter goes right into the other one.

190
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:41,799
Dude, I planned this so well. Whoa. What a God. He knew. What is this thing here?

191
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:53,349
Isn't that a pillar? Yeah, there's four of them. I'll have you know throughout our entire

192
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:58,630
Terraria playthrough where me and Ashley beat the game together. Uh, most boss fights we quoted

193
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:06,869
a classic drama quote. Isn't building this platform cheating? What do you mean? What is that? What do

194
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:10,950
you mean classic? That's the one thing I took away from us playing together is that building

195
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,069
platforms to fight bosses is cheating. I didn't know. I think you would, I think you would really

196
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:20,470
think it was funny. The one thing that we built, there's a, you remember the giant mech head,

197
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:28,710
the skeleton head with the big arms swinging around. So we made a giant railroad in the sky

198
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:33,430
that goes on a diamond and it goes too fast. So he can't catch you and he just stays in the middle

199
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:40,410
spinning and actually had so much defense. We can only do one damage to him. So he AFKed

200
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:43,690
until it was dead for like 30 minutes.

201
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:56,970
That's so stupid. Why am I fighting ice with ice? Isn't that a mistake? I don't know. Yeah,

202
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:04,819
I think you're healing them. I love being Bowser. This is great. I would have died like three times

203
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:20,920
by now. Ow, don't kill me. Come on. Dude, heal. What's the heal button? Press L. I do. I just get

204
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:28,309
hurt. I get killed so I get hurt. When anything touches me, it does like six hearts. Maybe you

205
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:35,420
should get armor. This is your doing. You said be the summoner so I can have constant DPS because

206
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:42,779
I don't trust you. You can focus on dodging because you don't have to attack. David, I want to attack.

207
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:55,529
Just dodge. Just dodge. I died. Or you can just always use that teleporter to get right back.

208
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:22,710
Which teleporter was it? I forget. The one on the roof. Yeah, I get confused if my enemies are not

209
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:33,400
projectiles or if they're my projectiles. Whose projectiles are who? It's almost over. You can go

210
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:43,670
back to your Mario RPG. Don't even talk shit about Mario RPG. So how many times do you jump on an

211
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:49,299
enemy's head before they die? You do the chain combo jumps when you attack. You just sit there

212
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:57,460
and hit a 20 chain. Everyone else is doing the sleep phase. You turned the stream on for five

213
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,819
minutes when I was trying to do the ultra achievement. Why do you know that? Because

214
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:10,019
I said I played it a long time ago. Did you ever do the 100 super jumps in a row? I don't think so.

215
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:16,339
I think I actually didn't play it and I watched my brother play it if I had to guess. I almost

216
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:22,900
had a meltdown trying to get it. I got to like 38 without like save states. You ever play Vagrant

217
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:31,990
Story? No. Very good game. It's the Dark Souls of before Dark Souls was a thing. For the PS1,

218
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:38,309
I would recommend it. I mean, you like old games. I do. It also has the Super Mario RPG mechanic

219
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:46,200
where if you hit and you attack, you know, you can do another attack. Timed hits. Yeah. Very good.

220
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:51,960
Very, very good. Cool. You know, I'm just going to wait 30 more years for the roadmap and we can

221
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:59,799
all enjoy it because it's really awkward. There's like no sound in the game. There's no sound.

222
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:08,150
There's sound, but it's it's like PS1 era and everyone has a square face and there's no actual

223
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:15,930
voice dialogue. It just everything's really quiet and claustrophobic. Anyway,

224
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,700
we're going. We're going back to the base. We got to go the other direction for the other pillars.

225
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:32,890
How many more pillars are there? Two. And then after we do the two pillars, we then combine them

226
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:39,289
all. Your mind goes blank. You're not sure what's coming. But the stir told me it's the Moon Lord

227
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:46,220
and he then you got to fight him. So I teleported back within the thing and yeah, I can't get out

228
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,660
now. I'm stuck again. I need to rebuild this. Oh, don't worry. That person has a clone.

229
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,480
We just made them meet for the first time and look at this. They're like, oh my God, are you me?

230
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,680
What was in the prison cell next to you the whole time? How long have you been here for?

231
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:14,650
God, I've seen maybe two or three years. They got a lot to talk about. So that I'm okay with that.

232
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:19,690
No, unfortunately, they don't count as rooms anymore and they're both going to escape. Good.

233
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:25,750
Good. They'll have their own like fucking Nickelodeon TV show. All right. You ready?

234
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:39,660
They'll be on Cartoon Network. All right. I'm yes, I'm ready. How about for Moon Lord? Like I don't

235
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:55,460
attack him. I just like let you do it. No, that's not fair. Oh, easy. He jumped. Just I'll just

236
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,859
I'll play support. No, I'm going to do the technique where I just don't. I just run around. I

237
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,779
just don't try not to get hit. Actually, I think Moon Lord, I think you outrun him with the UFO

238
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:16,819
like very slightly. I can't remember. I can always build a railroad for space, but I think that's

239
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:41,180
cheating. Space railroad. That sounds kind of fun. Yeah, I'm just trying not to get hit. If I get hit

240
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:47,859
three or four times, I'm dead. What is that light steel? Is it life leech in this game?

241
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,940
Oh, there's one really dumb accessory that I'm using that for you, man. It's really easy to

242
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:01,539
get item and it's the best item in every mod I've played. You take you take like 50% more damage,

243
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:07,460
but when you take 25% more damage, but under 50% health, you have 25% light steel.

244
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,980
As long as you're shooting, you don't die. That's pretty awesome.

245
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,599
Yeah, it's like if you just want to like vegetate out. Whoa, whoa, get off me.

246
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:27,690
It's really the go-to. Somebody said fighting Moon Lord with ancient ice chunk and they said

247
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:45,019
not like this. What is that? Why is that a bad thing? They seem to think so, but it's normal.

248
00:34:53,719 --> 00:35:07,110
Okay. Before we do the last pillar, we can actually go do a boss and we'll get you a better

249
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:26,599
summon. Oh, what? Watch out. Watch out. All right. I'm going to dodge. Am I like shut off? Why can

250
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:33,099
I not do anything? What's wrong with me? Some enemies have a debuff that'll disable your UFO.

251
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:45,420
This guy might have it. I have my summons. I'm just trying to avoid it. No. Oh, please. No,

252
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:55,820
don't kill me. They're like in the background. Thank you. They're in the background of my game.

253
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:11,449
It's funny. Like I'm pretending I can be hurt. It's for the stream. Wait, how did I end up this

254
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:20,440
far away from you? Oh God. Where's the closest teleporter? Uh, you can open the map and teleport

255
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,599
to me. I can be hurt. What just happened? Uh, and then you click on me if you have the potions.

256
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:41,880
Why did I end up here in funky town? How did I end up in funky town? I'm just going to fucking

257
00:36:41,880 --> 00:37:05,179
fly to you. I'm coming home. Am I not gaining? Okay. So you press the M. I don't know. I don't

258
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:13,050
have a port to me. I don't have the potions. Are you teleport to funky town? I teleported to funky

259
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:19,210
town and that was like the checkpoint for me to get over to you. What is this? Another one.

260
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,250
Okay. There's another guy over here. There's a, I just, I think I just, I'm gonna, I got bad news

261
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:36,010
for you. Um, bringing over the last pillar. Uh, the part of the move. Oh, I don't kill it. I'll be

262
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:47,260
there in like 10 seconds. Just dodge, dodge, dodge. Don't kill it. 0.1. If I stop shooting,

263
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:57,079
I can take damage. Hold on. Hey, can you see my fire? Am I getting close? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

264
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:03,960
You got it, dude. That hit it. Did I get it? Yeah. What are you kidding me? Oh my God. I'm making a

265
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:10,949
montage just for that. I hit it from all the way back here. Dude. That's fucking awesome. Are you

266
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:18,730
serious? That's probably, I mean, has anyone ever done something like that before? Are we

267
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:30,119
summoning a boss here? Are we going to fight the, um, the teller? Hold on. Um, we can, we can also

268
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:43,780
make, hold, hold on. A lot of things are happening right now. Here. Okay. Here. Here. Now that guy

269
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,699
can stop laughing at you because you have a new summon staff. Say they left. They're gone. Oh,

270
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:53,059
that guy. They're going to, they're going to find themselves. Oh, that's great. No, not the guy in

271
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:58,820
chat. The two people. What two people? You don't even, how do you not remember that thing, that

272
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,139
really weird, fun thing that happened like less than five minutes ago? The thing you sent me?

273
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:13,210
Yes. Okay. So I started a cell staff, so I'm replacing this. Let's check this out. Oh, this is

274
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:19,340
the, uh, this thing that I gave the materials for last time, right? What? You have to unsummon your

275
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:39,369
other things. And where are they? All right. So I'm just a bubble guy now. Yeah. Now you're a bubble

276
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:47,130
guy. Yeah. Last time we played, I looked up some stuff on the Wikipedia and I said, like there was

277
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,849
some summons that I thought were cool. And I was like, what materials do we need? And I got some

278
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:54,090
off stream and then I just like, I'm just going to leave them in the box and next time we'll figure

279
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:58,409
it out. So you just, you just made it for me now just to kind of speed things up. So

280
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:17,219
all right. What else did I get? Astral Bulwark. $10 to kick Yerma from the server. It's not enough.

281
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:26,360
$10 to kick me from the server. You're going to have to add like five zeros. Yeah. How come

282
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:34,570
all of my donations are to ask Yerma things? That's what all mine are too. I don't even,

283
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:46,539
I don't even like this guy. Boy, that wasn't me. All right. So I want to, I want something

284
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:52,889
else besides the snowstorm staff. Maybe I should just put the zealous thing here and just use that.

285
00:40:53,769 --> 00:41:01,690
I'm going to give that a try. That sounds like a lot of fun. Shut up. Shut up. What? It's in my

286
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:11,079
brain. What is in your brain? What are you talking about? Do you have any meld blobs?

287
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:21,480
Metal blobs? Meld blobs. What do they look like? Purple blobs. I should have way more of them.

288
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:29,059
Purple blobs. Oh wait, no, that's right. You have the thing that's like,

289
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:35,139
Hey Star, just wanted to ask you a question. You have one of those, don't you? I do. Star,

290
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:45,909
don't act like he doesn't have a name. Oh, you have one of those? That's very disrespectful.

291
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:57,480
I want to look, what can I make? I want to see what I can, can I turn this into something?

292
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,860
Yeah. What can I turn this into? All right. I can make Kevin's catalyst, which is

293
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:16,570
rogue damage. Now this is all melee damage and shit. There's actually a lot of things we can make

294
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:21,369
right before the end here because now we also get astral ore. You know what astral ore gets you?

295
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:28,230
What is that? Okay. Wait, first of all, I am going to get potions out of that inventory.

296
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:39,619
Inventory? Okay. I gave you $25, now kick Yerma. No, that's, he said like three zeros,

297
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:45,380
wasn't it? I mean, that's like, you're going to have to give Star like 10 grand to get rid of me.

298
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:59,510
Yeah. I mean, that's how much he's given me to play with him. So competing against a lot here.

299
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:16,300
Oh, here's $15. Okay. All right. So I want to do, what did I want to do? Potions.

300
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:21,219
Right. All right. Did you use the life fruit after you used the things you did, you know that?

301
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:36,869
I got 425. Yeah. One of these give me no mining potion. No, wouldn't have potion. No,

302
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:43,750
archery potion. Don't want it. Water walking, night owl, shine. All these potions suck. What

303
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:51,300
are you putting in here? Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, I wish we had a potion person so we could do

304
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:59,829
this. You told me that the guy was a new potion mod guy, but I don't think he showed up yet.

305
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:08,730
Excuse me for you adding and deleting mods. Fix those rooms. Actually, I think there's enough

306
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:39,900
empty ones. No, just fine. I'll fix it. Thank you. There's enough. Wait, don't be in it.

307
00:44:40,860 --> 00:45:06,199
Shit. All right. Bubbles, get out of the way. All right. I fixed the room. Well, let's go here.

308
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:21,130
I've got my bubbles. I wish I had those potions. The potions really did help me so much. Um,

309
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:25,769
you know, we're just going to sit around and wait and tell some stories.

310
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,449
What stories do you have for me? All right. My arm, my shoulder really hurts. Well,

311
00:45:33,449 --> 00:45:38,889
you have any recommend what I could have for this? Yes, I do. Well, I'm being dead serious now.

312
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:45,690
Is it like your like, like rotator cuff? Or I don't know what that means. Is it your shoulder?

313
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,449
Is it the like the joint inside your shoulder? Is it the muscle? Is it?

314
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:55,699
How did you sleep last night? If it helps, I can also dislocate the shoulder like on command.

315
00:45:56,659 --> 00:46:00,099
You might have something. There might be something going. You might need to see. Um,

316
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:04,889
you might need to get, take, get that taken a look at. Oh, well, I've been able to do that

317
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:10,889
since I was like, like four years old. Oh, okay. But still, some, uh, the other kid,

318
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:15,449
he dragged me across my porch because we were playing a game and it pulled out of the socket

319
00:46:15,449 --> 00:46:19,929
and it hurt a lot. But now I can just like pop it out and it's like whatever. You were playing a

320
00:46:19,929 --> 00:46:29,269
game. Yeah. And it was what the fuck are you talking about? I was playing a game when I

321
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:34,389
was like four years old and the other kid was dragging me by my arm. What game requires you?

322
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:37,989
I can't remember. I was like four. I don't remember the game. It was some stupid game.

323
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:53,179
Okay. Checkers. Yeah. We're playing like checkers. Yeah. Yeah, it was checkers. I think actually.

324
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:09,619
All right. Oh, but anyways, um, now if you haven't like joint problems, joint pain,

325
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:13,780
I would, I would see a physician about it, but you might consider taking that. Then you might

326
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:21,739
consider taking some glucosamine, chondroitin compound. Should help a little bit. Okay. Yes,

327
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:31,050
I am not a doctor. Can you spell that for me? It's just like it sounds. Uh, try to spell that

328
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:47,320
for me. Okay. Okay. One more time. Glucosamine, chondroitin. What the hell is this? Strange plant.

329
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:58,619
Nice. What is the strange plant? That's like a, you turn the game on and you can find those

330
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:06,059
in the dirt like at minute one. Hey star, you should tell Jerma he don't need to pick up strange

331
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:15,829
plants. God, he's so dumb. No, they're not mean to you. Star. I don't think in your whole life,

332
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:29,429
no one's ever been mean to you. I don't know how you do it. How do you do it, man? What the heck is

333
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:38,599
that? That's just your Trump. No, it's not.

334
00:48:42,409 --> 00:49:01,320
That's just, no, it's not. You guys need to get your ears cleaned. Yeah, guys. Come on. No,

335
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:10,090
I was wondering what's going on here. All right. You ready? Um, not yet. Cause I think it might be

336
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:19,929
a huge problem. Where is my, he's ready. I'm ready. No, I'm not. Where the fuck is my staff

337
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:32,840
that summons these things? Did you put it in? Did you auto-stash it? No, I got it. Here's a random

338
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:40,780
staff. Wait, no, where the fuck is it? Why is snowstorms staff here? I didn't do anything.

339
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:53,510
What the hell is this? No, what happened to my staff that summons the bubbles? What is going on

340
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:59,769
right now? What did I, did I do something? What did I do? You probably, okay. No, no, no. Yeah,

341
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:09,260
I did. I did. All right. We're good. Okay. We're going to, we're going to skip everything. Skip

342
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,380
everything. Why everything? We're going to, we're going to skip everything. Come up here.

343
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:18,460
Actually, I need potions for this. Don't you wish you could have potions for this?

344
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:34,489
Hello. Hello. What are you doing? Hello. Star is going to carry Jerma. I hope you guys understand

345
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:38,889
that this entire Terraria, Jerma, and Star play. Yeah, that's right. I'm on the front of the ticker.

346
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:49,130
This entire Jerma and Star play Terraria has been Star showing me this game while I sit behind him

347
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:55,769
in the chair and watch him play. Yeah. He just has an in-game point of view. And it's been great so

348
00:50:55,769 --> 00:51:04,630
far. We should totally have this NPC by now. It's this, no, it's not this guy. This guy sells life.

349
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:26,519
Here, Carl. It's not Carl. I mean, you've been doing a whole lot of just interesting things.

350
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,449
No, get away. Get the fish. Wow. I just saved that goldfish's life.

351
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:42,420
Oh, this is Lucy. This is the person. She was here the whole time. You're the backseater while

352
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:48,420
Chad is the third guy across the room playing Fortnite. Jerma, get over here on Lucy. Lucy.

353
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:05,400
Time to get them all. Thorn's potion. Get two of them. Who cares? We got platinum.

354
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:10,440
There is a server crash if one of us is talking to her and you change which shop it is.

355
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,719
What? I'm not going to touch anything then. I'm just going to buy the things I know I want.

356
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:24,760
Okay. Okay. This is just, okay, here we go. Max number of minions. Get a few of those.

357
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:32,309
I need more money. Don't touch me. There's a bunch of platinum in there. Yeah. Yeah, there is.

358
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:43,530
Here comes the crash joke. Are you talking to Lucy right now?

359
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:53,300
Okay, you're not. Whoops. What? Are you? I just, I'm in, I am in Lucy's menu right now.

360
00:52:53,940 --> 00:53:03,239
Don't do anything. This place is crazy with all this fungus. You know what I'm saying?

361
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:15,909
Hey Jerma, you know what I'm saying? City and skin. I want mana regeneration. More than that.

362
00:53:17,909 --> 00:53:29,690
Titan. Battle? No. Hey Jerma. Max life? You're muted. I must have pressed L. I apologize

363
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:36,170
profusely. Do you know what I'm saying? Say it again. I don't know what you said. No.

364
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:51,539
Okay. I am ready to do whatever it is you want to do. I'm ready to see the end game.

365
00:53:54,309 --> 00:54:11,929
One second. Okay, so this boss is from Thorium Mod and it's supposed to be fought after Moonlord,

366
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:17,579
but for some reason they decide it like, if you die they don't want it to despawn,

367
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:24,940
so it's really easy because it just never goes away. Okay. So it gives ridiculous absurd items

368
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:29,739
where you don't have to think anymore. You just put all the items on. Nice. So if you don't want

369
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:37,260
to think, all you got to do is beat like a three-stage boss. Okay. Was that it? The Simon says that

370
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,869
you just put down? Only usable at night. I think it's about to be night. How good are you at Simon

371
00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:55,000
says? I'd say I'm Simon, right? How good am I at Simon? Yeah, the thing with like the five lights

372
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,440
and it goes, Oh, red light, green light. No, you have to like stop when the person says red light.

373
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:09,239
No, you have to listen. And then you put your thumb up. You have to match it.

374
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:15,159
I win. Okay. So I'm pretty good. Okay. Fine. You think you're so fucking hot. Here we go.

375
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:17,079
Okay.

376
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:40,070
It's getting harder.

377
00:55:42,889 --> 00:55:44,280
It's getting harder.

378
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,579
Not bad. You got it.

379
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:55,579
Hmm. Somebody's a little smarter than I thought.

380
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:17,579
All right. Close. That was it. Let's go. I win. I messed him up. I win. No, you ripped the

381
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:23,099
batteries out of the machine. That doesn't count. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. He's broken. It's broken.

382
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:28,539
What's going on? I think it's broken. I told you, you broke it. You pulled the batteries.

383
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:38,579
You can't pull the batteries out. Where'd you go? Do you just have like a notepad full of like

384
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:45,539
time fillers that you can do in any game? Like just in case something goes awry. I got it.

385
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:58,039
I got to fill some time here. Yeah. Yeah. You're very good at it. I'll give you that. Okay.

386
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,440
What one's nighttime? Is it 6 PM guys? Is that when mom calls you in for dinner? I don't know.

387
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,030
That's not on my notepad. I only know what's written down on my second monitor. Okay. Well,

388
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:12,489
what's next on the script? Wouldn't you like to know? Magician never gives away his script.

389
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:28,489
Okay. Ma says we can stay out till 7 30. It's a five of 43 PM right now. You mean secrets.

390
00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:44,360
That is that's a script. I'm going to just walk somebody here. What are we doing?

391
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:51,800
We're waiting for nighttime. It's almost nighttime. Is that another hour? Time goes by fast. But not a

392
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:59,099
real hour. There's a there's items to like switch it tonight, but I can't remember. What are your

393
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:09,960
computer specs? I don't know. I got a Dell. I have a gateway PC. You know, those like $245

394
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:18,679
cow machines. They didn't even come with a fucking CPU. I don't know what's up with our health. I

395
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:38,519
don't know why I have 540. I don't know what happened. It is now 7 PM. That's nighttime,

396
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:52,099
right? We need it to be 7 PM. TTS. When is sundown? Star. Sundown is at 7. Hey, how could you even get

397
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:58,230
in on the wow classic thing? You have like five seconds to answer before like an end game.

398
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:06,539
Okay. So I, okay. I already did it. Here's your answer. That's a really good answer. I'm glad that.

399
00:59:09,739 --> 00:59:21,260
All right. Here we go. Oh my God. All right. Pay attention to this.

400
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:25,340
You're gonna have to do this back to me. It's Simon. You're gonna have to do it back to me.

401
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:38,329
Okay. Okay. Just do something. I don't think you understand what I'm saying. I'll try.

402
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:54,900
Was that good? Oh, I dropped 32 gold. I'm sorry. 32 gold is not a lot. It's a lot.

403
01:00:02,409 --> 01:00:09,699
Well, that is not good against enemies that move quickly. Oh, these aren't moving fast.

404
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:21,139
Surely you're getting eaten alive down there. I know. I can't do it. I'm like, I'm just like,

405
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:27,750
who? I may as well just be walking into the towers. I'm surprised you're not writing in chat right

406
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:40,900
now. Oh, dude, I almost got my adrenaline meter. I've almost got revensions. I'm going to stay in

407
01:00:40,900 --> 01:01:03,769
here. What are you doing over here? He's being useless. Ooh, that was a pretty good setup there.

408
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:19,030
I'm probably shouldn't, maybe I shouldn't go in the air. I'm like, they hit faster than me.

409
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:30,539
UFO has a little flow in some spots, but this is also, I think you and Ashley, I want to build

410
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:37,820
the thing just to show you the stupid circle mine cart that confuses every boss.

411
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:51,019
Get out of the fucking baby trolley. All right. Oh God.

412
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:03,050
This is the expert level. And you know, there's a YouTube video of a guy doing this

413
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:09,610
and his hands are just like around the whole Simon. Can they chase you for a second so I

414
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:30,099
can switch my arrows? Sure. I'll go like this. Thank you. I am very pleased. I'm very happy to be

415
01:02:30,739 --> 01:02:37,929
the rock that you threw to distract the enemy. I don't know what you did, but it worked for a

416
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:44,920
second. I didn't think it would be possible. It's like a ghost in here. What is even fucking in here?

417
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:54,019
Stop, leave me alone. Get it again. I spawned, they spawned in here.

418
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:06,500
What was that? So that was like a car accident. Is it safe to come back? Don't worry,

419
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:14,969
Jerma. It's not much longer. There we go. There we go. There we go.

420
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:26,440
I love your one little Pokemon still blowing wind down there.

421
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:35,110
I just get hit and die. I can't avoid damage. I just get hit three times and explode.

422
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,989
This is really my fault. In the past, for like most other streams, I would have prepared you for

423
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:53,880
this. But it's like the finish line is right there and my little brother just tripped and it's like

424
01:03:53,880 --> 01:04:01,909
I'm looking back, but I'm still running forward. Yeah. And I'm really hurt too. No, brother,

425
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:08,230
little brother, give me that back. Not only did I fall down, I got very seriously injured.

426
01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:15,210
There's another phase. I don't think it happens. My leg is going the other way and you're all just

427
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:36,070
like, ah, okay. No, but seriously drop those. All of it? Yeah. This is a stick up. And then,

428
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:44,300
okay. I'll give you what you need. We're at the finish line and I just saw you trip,

429
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,420
but I don't care and I didn't prepare you. Hey, hey, hey, come here, come here, come here.

430
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:52,300
Didn't that- You're taking one of these. Didn't that happen like three streams ago, by the way?

431
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:58,699
I think I've had a broken leg just sitting there since like we fought the fucking plant boss.

432
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:07,900
A broken leg? Yeah. You know, I'm bringing up your like running the race joke. No, I agree.

433
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:14,309
This happened like two streams ago. We hit plantera and I was just like, okay. Like I have a-

434
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:18,789
Oh, fuck. I pressed B for backpack and I'd B for drink all potions.

435
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,429
Yeah. You did just drink all your potions.

436
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:30,710
Oh, my leg. Big butter. Big bit of my leg. You're going to have to pick me up.

437
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:36,570
And that's, that's for you too. What the fuck is this? This is like the best item I've ever seen.

438
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:45,030
Yeah. What is this stuff? It's like I said, that's supposed to be the final boss of thorium

439
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:52,409
and it's not that hard and it just keeps- It's like, here's the end of the game. Here,

440
01:05:52,409 --> 01:05:57,050
have some goofy end game items that you can craft immediately. And-

441
01:05:57,849 --> 01:06:02,650
What? I can have like 10 of these? Yeah. Now you turn into like a superhero.

442
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:13,500
Where are the armor? No. Okay. Where are the armor? I'm- I know.

443
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:20,119
I- I- It also makes you bind a special key that I don't think you have bound or you'll

444
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:28,309
have to check in the options if you have it. Molten banner. I'm holding this banner. What the

445
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:36,170
fuck? 25%. What do I get for this? Set bonus. Pressing the special ability key will unleash

446
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:43,030
an echo of slag fury's power. It's like a bonus stationary summon that shoots a million missiles.

447
01:06:43,829 --> 01:07:06,309
Do I even have special bound? Keybinds. Special ability. Where is special ability?

448
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:14,469
Uh, it would be under thorium. Oh, it's like a mod. Yes. Uh, controls all the way down at the

449
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:22,309
bottom. Thorium special ability. Thorium special ability. Um, like, I'm gonna, I guess, just,

450
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:31,960
I'm just, jeez, is that okay? How long- What's the cooldown on this? Uh, it's like a minute.

451
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,400
I don't know. I don't know exactly. I just pressed it. It didn't do anything. It just like

452
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,920
looked like- No, that thing right there is- Oh. Well, there's nothing, there's no enemy,

453
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:49,510
so it's not shooting. Oh, I see. Cool. All right. Nice. Well, now we can just like sneeze on moon

454
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:57,349
lord. You want to just sneeze and kill moon lord? Yeah. Ooh, let's go get it. Right. Into the UFO.

455
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:02,230
Yeah, where's that guy? He's laughing at you for using astral chunks. Where's that guy now?

456
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:06,710
Yeah, where's that guy? Yeah, my big bro killed Ragnarok for me. Where'd that guy go?

457
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:18,869
What's your favorite 80s comedy movie? Ignore the pink blocks. 80s Ghostbusters.

458
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:26,680
That's not a comedy. Is it 80? Was that 88? 89? Was that 90? Might be 99. 91 maybe. You're debating

459
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,880
the wrong thing. It's not a comedy. Yes, it is. What are you talking about? There's not like a

460
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,720
single funny thing in that whole movie. Every single actor in that was a comedian. Wait,

461
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:42,390
wait, hold on. What did you just say? Quote one funny thing from Ghostbusters. What the hell are

462
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:59,100
you doing? Okay, I just did that. Anyone laugh? Were there any lulls in your chat? That's an actual

463
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:05,000
quote from that movie and it's a really funny part of the movie. Those who get it will know.

464
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:17,689
Are we talking the one where the Ghostbusters were all women or like classic? Dan Aykroyd,

465
01:09:17,689 --> 01:09:26,180
Bill Murray. That died instantly. Yeah, we have really good items now.

466
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:37,180
Am I not using this? Somebody said use the fire staff. Isn't that the fire staff?

467
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:44,279
Superior ancient spark? Oh, there was a different like magic attack I could have gotten you. I don't

468
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:52,199
think I crafted one. Use the molten banner while holding this banner. Wait, that's not like a

469
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:59,689
Diablo 2 charm. I have to actually hold it out. Watch out, dude. Moon Lord's coming.

470
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:02,569
Is Moon Lord coming? This is going to be the hardest fight because this is like

471
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:16,250
end game content. This is Deathwing. That's end game content. Okay, I'm ready. Does he go...

472
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:23,510
Holy shit, that's actually way crazier than I thought it was going to be.

473
01:10:24,069 --> 01:10:47,180
He's got me. Is he dead? I think so. Oh no, no, he's half. Now you're going to shoot his heart.

474
01:10:47,979 --> 01:10:57,859
Go for the hot. I can't get in close enough. Oh no, he's dead. That was rough. Hey,

475
01:10:57,859 --> 01:11:03,140
give me the freaking Luminite. What are you doing, little bro? Congratulations. You have just beaten

476
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:15,289
the base game of Terraria. See you guys later. That's it. What do you want? Luminite or Luminite.

477
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:23,689
Do you want one of my huge... Never mind. Luminite or Celestial Onion. What does it look like?

478
01:11:23,689 --> 01:11:31,930
Shadow Diamond. Yeah, I'm going to give you a hundred beats. Where is it? Luminite or...

479
01:11:32,569 --> 01:11:42,939
What does it look like? Is it portal gum? It's ore, so it looks like a little blob.

480
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:53,640
Yeah, there's a portal gum. I don't think I have any of this shit. Oh, Luminite. You keep

481
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,039
little brothering and picking it all up. This doesn't look like ore. This looks like trash.

482
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:04,890
Oh, thank you. Thank you for giving me the trash. Okay, so what's going to happen now, I guess,

483
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:09,770
is you can tell funny stories and I'm going to speed run the post-Moon Lord content.

484
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:21,829
What? This is cool. Quick, do the thing. Hold on, I got to do the thing. I got to do the thing.

485
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:47,159
Wait. No, hold on. Oh, shit. Is he doing something funny?

486
01:12:48,859 --> 01:12:53,100
Yeah, I'm doing the thing that you do with the portal gun in the first 40 minutes of portal.

487
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:57,930
You figure out you can do that. All right, so you want to speed run the rest of the game?

488
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:00,810
Yeah, I'm like, I'm just, I'm not going to clue you in.

489
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:11,449
Well, I'm just going to teleport to you. I'm just going to buy wormhole potions and then teleport

490
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:30,250
to you. Oh, there's the, there's the original music. It's been a journey. Why are there snowmen with

491
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:38,729
guns up here? Snowmen, gangsters? It was in my inventory, so I had to get rid of it.

492
01:13:38,729 --> 01:13:51,210
Oh, they're dead. Oh, did I? Oh, that's awesome. That's such a cool enemy. Okay, I'm going to buy

493
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:58,539
some, I'm going to buy some pots and then I'm coming to you. Did they sell wormhole potions

494
01:13:58,539 --> 01:14:03,829
or do I just have to make them? Right. Do we have any? Well, you can buy them from Lucy,

495
01:14:03,829 --> 01:14:13,619
but you have to send it to store one. So when you talk to her, she says, which shop?

496
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,850
You need it to be classic, like wild classic, you know what I'm saying?

497
01:14:23,619 --> 01:14:29,619
Okay, that's weird, I guess. Strangely enough, I don't know what you mean by that. Reeses.

498
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:39,140
All right. How do you eat it? Who cares? You sound like someone, but who do you sound like?

499
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:48,470
Who was that? I should know that was Will Arnett, the Reese's commercial. I thought you guys would

500
01:14:48,470 --> 01:15:00,819
have known what that was. I would make, I would make quasars flair. It's very good. But I gave my

501
01:15:00,819 --> 01:15:06,020
Daedalus Stormbow to my other character. Where the fuck is this wormhole potion? Because I didn't

502
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:12,619
play for three weeks. I don't have one right now. $50 just came in right now. $50. Thanks for the

503
01:15:12,619 --> 01:15:19,979
$50 AV Joe. And this is for Star. Hey, please tell, uh, hey Sturm, tell, please tell Jar that he's

504
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:23,020
doing a good job. Glad to see you playing one of my favorite games. Will you be playing it again

505
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:30,979
when they release mini golf? Is that real? Uh, I will. I don't know if I'll stream it, but I'll

506
01:15:30,979 --> 01:15:36,949
probably play that. Oh yeah. Yeah. Now the answer for me is no. Make sure you catch Star Stream.

507
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:47,449
Are you said to? All right. Hold on. Shop changer. You said vanilla, right? Yeah.

508
01:15:48,729 --> 01:15:58,539
On Lucy. And what color is the wormhole potion? Um, blue water walking feather fall. Why is there

509
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:25,319
like a triceratops in here? I'm looking for triceratops. Uh, is that me? I don't know what

510
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:41,130
that was. Okay. Invisibility, gills, flipper, hunter. I have no idea what that is. It sounds

511
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:50,949
like I live. I'll be right back. Is that thunder? It sounds like an airplane in my house. Yeah. Go

512
01:16:50,949 --> 01:17:04,659
take a BRB. See what's going on. That sounded like there was like thunder. I don't think it's on

513
01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:20,970
here. Yeah. I think it's, uh, AC one 30 inbound. Uh, excuse me. Yeah. You've got a UAV. All right.

514
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:27,369
This is way more important. Where is this potion? Oh my God. Am I going to have to like, it's not

515
01:17:27,369 --> 01:17:34,060
on, it's not on vanilla wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, wormhole, worm, worm, worm,

516
01:17:34,539 --> 01:17:43,220
worm. Oh, you're right. Um, do you see in the underneath way at the bottom, bottom left,

517
01:17:43,220 --> 01:18:06,359
the like bottom, bottom NPC Severus, the alchemist he has. Okay. All the way down there. You have to

518
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:13,579
make a full metal alchemist reference. I'm not sure. No, I was going to just that was funny for

519
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:18,630
20 episodes. I was going to scream out, but then I don't think I could do it. I could

520
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:37,020
What was this guy's name? Severus found an alchemist. Hey, there they are. Good here.

521
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:46,680
You can have this. All right. I'm ready. I'm not sure.

522
01:18:52,859 --> 01:18:57,460
Very good. I'm hiring you. That was the test one.

523
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:11,579
That was an elbow chop. All right. So I'm ready. Let's go.

524
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:20,069
I'm going to be able to do this one more time. Deposit all. Yeah. Nice. All right. So what's the

525
01:19:20,069 --> 01:19:29,909
next thing we're going to do? I teleport to you. Well, I bought 10 of these. So, oh, you must be

526
01:19:29,909 --> 01:19:36,869
rich. You know, for 10 of those is at least five platinum in there, man. No, I didn't get rid of

527
01:19:36,869 --> 01:19:44,949
this stupid thing. This thing's causing me an issue. Is it having an issue right now? That's

528
01:19:44,949 --> 01:19:52,229
better. Now I can do one, two, three, four, five. I can do five of those. Damn. What was I doing?

529
01:19:55,779 --> 01:20:09,529
I need to make the unholy shard. What am I doing? Can I turn this into anything? This staff?

530
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:19,479
No, this is the ultimate ability. And do something with this? No. So is there any

531
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:26,739
reason at all to even have a pickaxe at this point? Do we need any? I made the really good

532
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,859
one that we need because there's new or that one, but I'm not making you one.

533
01:20:32,949 --> 01:20:36,729
Don't worry about it. Do I have to activate this or can I just hold it?

534
01:20:37,979 --> 01:20:45,779
Hold what? The big ice cream. You have to hold it. It's very clearly states while held. Yeah,

535
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:53,319
but I don't know. You don't know what? When I click, it goes, you don't know what? When I click,

536
01:20:53,319 --> 01:21:00,020
it goes, I didn't know if I had to turn it on or something. I don't know. Is there any reason for

537
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:06,039
at all to have German stars for area speedrun? I don't know. Is there any reason at all for you

538
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:09,800
to go on like a road trip with your friends or are you just going to go on that road trip by yourself?

539
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:24,890
Exactly. When you click on an enemy with a banner, it makes your minions target an enemy.

540
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:30,649
Okay. So there is a point to click. I mean, I didn't know. What am I supposed to know everything?

541
01:21:30,649 --> 01:21:34,010
I don't know. You have, you're the one with like 200 days played in this game.

542
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:42,710
I didn't, I didn't make a summoner ever. What am I supposed to know these things?

543
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:51,739
What the fuck was that? That was maybe a real funny guy. So what's the next boss?

544
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:58,359
Profane guardians. And then we got to kill the profane goddess and we have to kill, um,

545
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:06,090
uh, the marshmallow man. If I see your sound is muted one more time in this chat, I will,

546
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:15,859
I'm going to swallow a whole egg. Me? No, mine. What? Oh, what am I doing?

547
01:22:19,159 --> 01:22:21,560
Where's the thing I'm looking for? Tell me where it is.

548
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:37,189
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, celestial hill bomber.

549
01:22:47,939 --> 01:22:52,899
Didn't I make the fricking onk on this character? I did. Right?

550
01:22:52,899 --> 01:22:56,899
Before we played the game, you did mention I have too many characters. I don't know who is who.

551
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:05,739
You did say I don't, but I swear I like farmed and made an onk the last time we stopped playing

552
01:23:05,739 --> 01:23:13,159
and I know, and I just like, don't have it or is, or is this it? I don't know. No.

553
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:21,909
Why does the music keep getting funky? Oh, because of the mushroom biome that I made above us.

554
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:31,770
That's onk town wings. I don't feel like making all this stuff. Like I could,

555
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:35,369
but I've already done this with, I'm just going to, I'm going to go fight things.

556
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:41,590
So you're going to go fight, we're going, where are you going? To the teleporter?

557
01:23:43,239 --> 01:23:54,760
Oh, he's during the daytime, dude. My God. Like now, now. Hey, I keep forgetting to sleep in the

558
01:23:54,760 --> 01:24:03,939
bed. This is awful. I really am just a little kid in the car. I just have an ice cream in the car.

559
01:24:05,529 --> 01:24:10,310
Don't get it on the seat. I'm getting ready to fight a boss. We got to fight it during the day.

560
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:13,029
So I'm going to craft the thing that lets me skip the time of day, but I don't remember what I need

561
01:24:13,029 --> 01:24:18,949
to craft that thing. Let's go. Let's go. I'm assuming, I'm assuming souls of a night.

562
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:28,939
So let me ask you something. We, this is, we've done a, we've beaten Terraria, the base game.

563
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:36,140
No, yes. What has been your favorite moment from the Star and Jeremy Terraria playthrough?

564
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:41,340
I told you. What was it? It was when you said, isn't this cheating when we were making platforms

565
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:48,460
to fight a boss? That's easily my number one takeaway and favorite moment. Cool.

566
01:24:50,779 --> 01:24:57,659
My favorite was learning how to alt click items to not deposit them after 16 hours.

567
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:10,600
Cool. Mine would be when like for some weird reason, you knew the recipe for the like day

568
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:16,819
changing item and you told me like how to do it. I did? No, like, no, like right now, if you told

569
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:20,500
me how to do it, that would be my favorite part. How do I do it guys? How do I do it? How do I do

570
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,739
it? How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it?

571
01:25:22,739 --> 01:25:29,060
I'm muted. How do I do it? I'm looking at chat. Someone says it's called Cosmo light. Like how

572
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:35,619
the hell does that help? If it was me, I would say I'm going to take a guess here. It's a hell stones

573
01:25:35,619 --> 01:25:45,300
and light souls. I don't know. That makes sense. I'm looking to be held by the hand here. I do

574
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:50,420
have to make moonlight and then I have to make daylight. Moonlight and sunlight, right? Three

575
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:55,060
sun stones and 22 of the fire spirits from the moon lord. I'm just taking a guess here.

576
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:16,250
You're wrong. You're wrong. You guys are supposed to get my back here. You're supposed to have my

577
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:42,949
back. 720 damage. Get you baited. So where are you off to now? I feel like the last like 12 minutes

578
01:26:42,949 --> 01:26:49,029
of this playthrough has been star remembers how to summon things. There's a lot of things

579
01:26:49,029 --> 01:26:54,149
to summon. You're going to fight a boss? Yeah. What the fuck have you not told me this for?

580
01:26:55,430 --> 01:27:16,970
Alright, let's go. Holy shit. This is fun. I like being able to destroy things and then they drop

581
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:22,220
the profane core which I don't think you can make this like non consumable but I don't think we need

582
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:28,649
to do. Pretty sure it will be the first time. I'm feeling pretty good about that. So are we fighting

583
01:27:28,649 --> 01:27:33,369
here? Yeah, we're going to fight here. The things that we just fought are adds for the next boss.

584
01:27:33,369 --> 01:27:52,260
Oh jeez. Okay. It's a pretty rough one. Alright, I'm ready. He's fast. He's fast.

585
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:08,699
He's like flying around in the dirt and I can't shoot him because they're up that high.

586
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:12,810
What are you doing?

587
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:52,409
What happened? My little brother shot up and just made it harder. God damn it. I'm just

588
01:28:52,409 --> 01:29:15,989
I don't know where I am. I've lost a dinghy world. Help. Watch you win.

589
01:29:20,979 --> 01:29:24,659
I'm just like I die. So I just I spawn. Hey, I'm going to spawn to you.

590
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:33,750
How was it? Did you do anything fun? He's dead. Nice. Good job. Thank you.

591
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:40,890
That was a tough one, huh? That was a tough one. Now, what do we do? When you show up and like take

592
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:50,409
all of the items again, which is my favorite part and then and what happens next, you know, go on.

593
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:55,460
I'd like tell you to give it to me. He's going to do it.

594
01:29:55,859 --> 01:30:03,460
Uh huh. I don't even remember what he dropped. I just remember it. It's it's important and you're

595
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:07,300
just going to like auto stash it and I'm not going to remember what it was. No, I'm going to throw

596
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:23,899
it to you right now. Oh, this one has summoned damage. Summoned it. Nice. Oh, poop. You're

597
01:30:23,899 --> 01:30:29,350
supposed to fight him in the other area to get the other. There are two items up here. Oh,

598
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:38,180
shit. Then you get the rune of cost. Look at this. But some say cost them. Get those. I'll wait for

599
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:49,579
you to get it. Divine Geode. OK, I got a divine unholy essence and a divine. I keep forgetting

600
01:30:49,579 --> 01:30:57,770
to sleep in the bed. And you make fun of me for making mistakes. Yeah, well, that's because you

601
01:30:57,770 --> 01:31:06,359
are more. So is this any good? This Divine Geo. What can I do with this? Let me talk to the guy.

602
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:12,949
Uh, I think you can chop it up. Yeah. I don't remember. What did you just say?

603
01:31:13,829 --> 01:31:21,779
I didn't say nothing. Hey, defense absorbs 25% damage on players on your team. Only active above

604
01:31:21,779 --> 01:31:31,800
25% life. OK, so it's like you can make armor. 10% increased damage. Any summoning stuff?

605
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:40,010
What? I'm just thinking if there's anything for summoners here with this Geode.

606
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:48,060
Unholy Essence. Let's see if I can do that. Profaned Crucible. Oh, we never fought the

607
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:52,060
Ravager. And now he's buffed because we killed that boss. We had to do the Ravager.

608
01:31:52,699 --> 01:32:03,239
How come you didn't remind me? I don't I don't know what that is. Did you did you get this stupid

609
01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:12,819
snowman staff? Are you snowman? Hail bomber summons kamikaze snowmen that will blow up upon

610
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:19,720
hitting enemies. I mean, that sounds like I did. All right, I'll try it. Is it a sentry? Does it

611
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:30,600
replace my cool thing? No, I think I think they're just spells. What? Yeah, they have like a

612
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:39,689
duration. Oh, OK. That's kind of cool. All right. Where are you off to now? Going to the dungeon.

613
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:56,100
Going to the dungeon. Why are you going down here? There's a there's a boss down here. There's a lot

614
01:32:56,100 --> 01:33:05,880
of new stuff in the dungeon. There's two bosses down here, actually. Are you snowman? I'm not

615
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:14,619
snowman. Never dig straight down. I didn't know that. What? You don't take fall damage

616
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:31,079
because of lava. Oh, I wouldn't see it. You are going so fast. Holy shit. Cool.

617
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:53,220
Oh, wow. Why are you going that way? I'm clearing space for in case one of the bosses show up.

618
01:33:53,220 --> 01:34:05,220
Oh, hey, German. I need you to just stay here. Stay here. Yeah, I'll be right back for real.

619
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:28,539
He's never coming back. Is he? Well, how is that not working? OK, I guess this item is dumb.

620
01:34:33,859 --> 01:34:50,859
Now I'm going to go. I'm now fully protected. Fuck. Just kill. OK, are you dying?

621
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:59,340
No, I just got almost insta killed. Why is this guy so bad? The guy playing, not the character.

622
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:05,029
That's what I mean. All right. I just almost died instantly by like a fireball. Should that be

623
01:35:05,029 --> 01:35:36,760
happening? Oh, I mean, this this area is a little bit buff, but no. How is it? Yes. I mean, see,

624
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:44,390
that's understandable. There's a lot of things going on. I just get hit twice and die. That's

625
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:56,300
what I've been doing for the last like hour and a half. Oh, I died. Shit. That was a that was a big

626
01:35:56,300 --> 01:36:00,779
oof. You know what they say? That was a big oof. That's what they say. You know what I'm saying?

627
01:36:00,779 --> 01:36:13,079
They talk about it. Stop it. Where are you going to the dungeon? I got to pick up all the things.

628
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:29,020
Wait, how did you go fast? Shit, you're like, oh, I'm just teleporting to you at this point.

629
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:36,539
Why would I wait? I'm going to get down there. I'm going to get down there when I get here. Finally.

630
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:45,510
Hey, don't matter how you eat it. It's okay. Okay. Um,

631
01:36:49,880 --> 01:37:03,930
this is scrumptious. What are you up to? No, I don't know. I did. I picked up. Look at all this crap.

632
01:37:04,729 --> 01:37:12,229
I don't even want this stuff. They won't leave me. I don't want it. There's a boss that summons

633
01:37:12,229 --> 01:37:16,949
here, but you have to get like 50 ectoplasms first. 50 ectoplasms. That sounds like a lot of

634
01:37:16,949 --> 01:37:22,710
ectoplasms. Like pink skulls that fly at you. I think appear after you kill enemies sometimes.

635
01:37:23,989 --> 01:37:27,270
And then it's kind of a tough boss and it might kill me, but I kind of want to fight it.

636
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:33,399
Either that or I can. Oh, hey, you got the portal gun? No, you don't have the portal gun.

637
01:37:33,399 --> 01:37:41,960
I deposited that what seems like a decade ago. Um, go home right now, little bro, because

638
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:46,520
I need you to get that portal gun for me. Okay, I'm going to get the portal gun.

639
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:57,270
Make sure you heal up, you know, buy your buff potions. Okay. Okay. What did you need? You need

640
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:00,869
the portal gun. Anything else while I'm here? I need the portal gun while you're there, bro.

641
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:12,439
Some people consider using it during a boss fight cheating. Do you? I don't. Why is it? I don't

642
01:38:12,439 --> 01:38:24,340
understand what you mean. How would that be cheating? You know, forget it. Did I already use all my

643
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:36,460
fucking potions? Well, I'm sorry. I'm coming. Hold on. Let me. I need more potions. Let's get some

644
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:50,600
magic power. I want some more of these. Okay, that's fine. I want to get. I think I'll put the four.

645
01:38:52,119 --> 01:39:04,939
Whatever. All right. Yeah, I got what you need. Okay. Come give it to me. Portal gun incoming.

646
01:39:06,939 --> 01:39:16,539
Thanks, bro. Here you go. Oh, okay. I was going to entrust the portal gun to you.

647
01:39:17,909 --> 01:39:31,079
No, don't trust me. The damn thing. Okay. Now we find a boss right now. Uh, not yet.

648
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:46,170
Okay. So you, you go, you go on this side, come out that side. Okay. We might need to make this

649
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:51,770
wider. You can't go in the portal if you're on your UFO. Right. But what's that? What is it? What

650
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:56,569
are we doing this for? Why do we have a portal? Because we're going to fight a boss and it's

651
01:39:56,569 --> 01:40:05,289
undodgeable. Undodgeable. It really helps to have. So what you mean just like go in portal and you

652
01:40:05,289 --> 01:40:09,850
end up over here and then do it again. Just run around a circle. Uh, yeah. Like once it comes

653
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:13,289
towards you, you go in the portal and then when it comes back towards you again, you go to the

654
01:40:13,289 --> 01:40:19,689
portal again. Uh, it's not foolproof. You're, you're going to die, but it'll help. What if I just stand

655
01:40:19,689 --> 01:40:35,000
protected in a manmade house? No. What do you mean? No. I mean, they all go to the walls. Uh,

656
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:43,380
fantoplasm. No warning. Okay. A like three, two, one would have been slightly helpful.

657
01:41:04,409 --> 01:41:21,579
You know, 2020 hindsight, you should have made it be the guy that has 50,000 HP. Not the guy that

658
01:41:21,579 --> 01:41:26,699
died. It would be really easy to switch to it if you want to. The, um, the armor that we got after

659
01:41:26,699 --> 01:41:35,420
killing Ragnaros, not Ragnarok. Uh, it gives you an armor set for melee and the special ability

660
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:41,779
button makes you immune for like a couple of seconds. And it also like gives you shields as

661
01:41:41,779 --> 01:41:51,300
you attack. Uh, and also you should have made me blah, blah, blah. Like I didn't make you anything.

662
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:58,300
You said summoner, you should do it. It's so much fun. And you, you entice me with like fun,

663
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:06,869
cool little pets. Well, little bro, if you want the melee set, I can make that for you and get you

664
01:42:06,869 --> 01:42:10,470
the life steal item so that you can just swing at things and press the immune button when you feel

665
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:16,060
scared. Just kidding. It's fine. I'm fine. You sure? That's very good. There's no shame. No,

666
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:36,840
no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. He said no. I lasted a lot longer that time during a blink

667
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:50,359
twice. Are you actually having fun? I think Terraria is a good game. Does illuminate? No,

668
01:42:50,359 --> 01:42:57,739
illuminate is irrelevant. That was blinked twice. So having fun. So Yolo bloom. And I

669
01:42:57,739 --> 01:43:18,979
forget the other one now. Um, I was rocking on chair. I want to get the other boss to someone.

670
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:34,500
I just got to kill things. Just kill stuff. Get down there. Get down there and attack that.

671
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:40,090
You guys are stupid, but when you get down and you finally do something,

672
01:43:40,890 --> 01:44:01,350
imagine being called stupid and it's stupid. Why are you digging? Why can't you just go down?

673
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:11,560
Why are you doing that? I really like the sound digging mix in Terraria and you got to make

674
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:15,159
things like, like once you can dig this fast, you got to make things like symmetrical and even.

675
01:44:16,119 --> 01:44:30,859
I just realized you're doing like 700 damage every quarter second. Yeah. No problem, bro.

676
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:43,560
Yeah, kind of. There's no water candles here. That's what's going on. There's no water cannons.

677
01:44:45,399 --> 01:44:53,659
Also, I'm getting spikes off the walls. Stop touching. You do that per fireball per quarter

678
01:44:53,659 --> 01:45:01,699
per second. You can equip the DPS meter and see what your DPS is. Let's compare it on the next

679
01:45:01,699 --> 01:45:07,300
boss. Do you have one? You should have it showing up on the right hand side because I have one.

680
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:09,779
Yeah. What do you got? Well, you can also make

681
01:45:11,539 --> 01:45:17,130
target dummies so you can shoot the target dummy. Let's find out. Read this. All right.

682
01:45:18,569 --> 01:45:45,109
Looks like you're sticking around. Oh, no. The little ghosts can kill me. I am just such a little

683
01:45:45,109 --> 01:45:53,750
shit wanker. What are you looking for exactly? Dungeon enemies. I think we got rid of all the

684
01:45:53,750 --> 01:46:01,670
water candles though. Unless I use another zerg potion. Hey, bro. Hey, bro. Yes. Go back up to

685
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:06,310
the room we cleared out and I'll be right back. Go back up to the room we cleared out. Yeah. That

686
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:11,350
big square room where I was digging a lot, you know, where there's like not a room. The big square

687
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:24,649
room. Okay. Got it. There's an alien here. What are you doing? Attack this. Kill this thing.

688
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:35,699
Attack it. Oh, it's not real. An illusion. Okay. I'm back. You're not even back up at the room yet.

689
01:46:35,699 --> 01:46:47,319
I thought I had an issue. All right. Come on, little bro. The thing is, the funny thing about

690
01:46:47,319 --> 01:46:57,560
this is people don't even know. I'm like older than you. He doesn't know, Pepe. Die. He doesn't

691
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:12,039
know. Okay, don't die. What? What the fuck? You can't just do this to me. I said don't die.

692
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:28,789
Oh, that's some slow down. Okay, here it comes. Not plantara. Hey, but there's no,

693
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:47,319
no potions available. I can't believe this boss is not plantara. Okay, what's your GPS? I'm dead.

694
01:47:48,579 --> 01:48:07,539
Oh, oh, you're still shooting at it. Why do I die so fast? I don't know. Star, why do I die in two

695
01:48:07,539 --> 01:48:13,460
hits? Because the summoner armorers throughout the entire game provide the least amount of armor.

696
01:48:15,449 --> 01:48:21,050
So you're taking more damage than any other class. Oh, and also you're just getting hit a lot.

697
01:48:22,069 --> 01:48:25,989
It's a combination of those two things. How many times do you, how many times do you have to hit

698
01:48:25,989 --> 01:48:42,939
before you die? You? I don't think I can. You can't die? Yeah. It's almost, it's like impossible

699
01:48:42,939 --> 01:48:47,020
to avoid damage in this game though, because shit is just on every pixel of your screen.

700
01:48:47,979 --> 01:49:00,380
Oh, that's not true. Not true. You literally can't die if you just go melee. You really should.

701
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:12,359
All right, I'm going melee. Let's go. I'll come back and buy this shit for you. I think I still

702
01:49:12,359 --> 01:49:20,760
have it in my inventory. Melee is so boring though. Yeah, but I've been playing this the whole time.

703
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:34,329
And if I really am just going to go like, oh, dead. I'd like to play the game. Okay. You're

704
01:49:34,329 --> 01:49:43,500
ready for me to hand things to you? Nope. Not yet. Uh-huh. No. Now I am. Take that. Wait,

705
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:52,630
was that the right one? What should it be? Yeah, that's the right one. Take that. Nice. Nice.

706
01:49:54,069 --> 01:50:02,140
Take that. Nice. Take that. Ooh. Uh, and I'll go get you the, um, the, uh,

707
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:10,039
I don't care anymore life steal item. Hey, thanks for boosting me to 60.

708
01:50:11,399 --> 01:50:16,420
No problem. Yeah. How come everyone in wild classic right now is like, oh, first to 60,

709
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:20,899
dude, just wait, wait until they add the buy a S level 60 account option.

710
01:50:20,899 --> 01:50:25,300
Do you know what I used to do? And now I am, I'm, I'm, I'm not ashamed. I'll tell,

711
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:30,100
who cares? That was, this was years ago. I used to, this is back before you could

712
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:38,180
purchase any of that shit. I used to have like the three characters, right? Yeah. So I'd have

713
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:44,020
three or four characters, like accounts, and I would multi box those accounts. And what I would

714
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:49,859
do is I would bring like level tens into the front door of a dungeon that they could get into level,

715
01:50:49,859 --> 01:50:54,500
like 10, 15, 20, depending on what the requirement was to get in. I would sit them at the door.

716
01:50:56,359 --> 01:51:00,279
So three people in the dungeon would just be standing at the front door, going into the

717
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:06,199
instance. I would then have my main character aggro the entire instance, every single enemy.

718
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:12,039
You could not get hurt. And then I would do one move once the whole dungeon was aggroed

719
01:51:12,039 --> 01:51:19,500
and they'd level up like 15 times. I think I told my chat was because I brought up

720
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:24,300
a few times the pressure. I told you, I used to multi box level accounts and sell them on

721
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:34,970
D2Legit.com in Diablo 2. It was a very short time of doing that. You'd have to like rush

722
01:51:34,970 --> 01:51:39,930
like a whole multi box room full of characters to like level 80 and not use a single skill point.

723
01:51:42,619 --> 01:51:49,880
We've all been there, Jerema. All right. Let me see what these things do. Very weak note.

724
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:59,130
Throws a hyper dense water malibut rains upon hit enemies. Holy shit. Okay. So the other one gives

725
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:03,689
you like bonus shields as you hit things. So you'll have bonus max health. You become

726
01:52:03,689 --> 01:52:08,409
invulnerable to damage when you use your special key. You get like a bubble around you. Look at

727
01:52:08,409 --> 01:52:16,260
this. This is so cool. Those all go homing as well. All right. So then and the accessory I gave you

728
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:22,579
is a is a big plus. Throws a hyper dense water malibut rains upon hit enemies. Raindrops shield

729
01:52:22,579 --> 01:52:30,020
your life. Life regeneration by five produces a floating globule over five seconds. Pressing

730
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:34,500
the special ability will develop you within an impervious shield. While the bubble is active,

731
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:39,140
all damage taken is converted into healing. I feel like I'm going to need this stuff. All right. So

732
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:52,279
let's try this again. So now, did you give me an accessory too? Yeah, it's like a black glove.

733
01:52:52,279 --> 01:53:10,199
Increases the damage you take by 25%. That's a lot. Yeah. All right. Let's try. It doesn't matter.

734
01:53:10,199 --> 01:53:14,409
All right. Hold on. I'm going to try and make you some melee items because I think we have all the

735
01:53:14,409 --> 01:53:19,479
stuff. I'm just going to do that really quick because I you still have like plus to summon

736
01:53:19,479 --> 01:53:34,170
items on. Yeah. Accessories. Yes. Oh my God. I just realized I got a gift sub. Thanks a bunch.

737
01:53:34,170 --> 01:53:41,979
Jerma sucks. Why am I wearing these boots and these old ass wings? I don't know. This is these

738
01:53:41,979 --> 01:53:58,779
bad frozen. I never got different wings. These old ass wings. And he's right. Any wing and then

739
01:53:58,779 --> 01:54:05,340
angel treads. Should we make this? We can make angel treads, but I just don't. I don't feel like

740
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:11,340
doing it. Oh, I know you don't even have. I have frozen wings. You have angel treads, right? Yeah,

741
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:18,439
you can upgrade them to serif tracers. I just do not feel like. I have frost spark boots. Oh,

742
01:54:18,439 --> 01:54:23,000
and yeah, you're a step behind. Then you should like not even wear them. Also, did you use the

743
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:31,109
celestial onion? Did I use an onion? I don't. What do you mean? Do you have six accessory slots?

744
01:54:33,529 --> 01:54:40,600
One. I have four and one of them is empty. Okay. You put this in the storage. Here, take this.

745
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:47,340
You put that in the storage. You use that item and it gives you an extra accessory slot

746
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:53,960
and you'd want it to store it for a better day. I'm going to hit you. You've been speed running.

747
01:54:55,159 --> 01:55:02,520
It's going too fast. It's going too fast. It's going too fast. You know, to be fair, I didn't

748
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:08,890
explain to my little brother what he should be doing. That's my bad. It's, you're going too fast

749
01:55:08,890 --> 01:55:14,970
for me. We, this is not just, I started playing Terraria. This is, we just got to Disneyland. I've

750
01:55:14,970 --> 01:55:21,829
never been to Disneyland, right? And you are sprinting to fucking like space mountain and I

751
01:55:21,829 --> 01:55:26,789
have a blindfold on. You're just like, let's go. And I'm like, I, I, wait a minute. I, oh, oh,

752
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:36,279
I want to get a corn dog. Fuck the corn dog. Get in line. I mean, that's, that's what's happening.

753
01:55:36,279 --> 01:55:40,359
And then you re we get, we go on space mountain and we get up to the top of space mountain,

754
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:45,399
the big drop. And then you rip the blindfold off and go look down. And I'm like, what happened?

755
01:55:49,159 --> 01:56:02,470
Yeah. That's what it's like playing Terraria. But it's really fun though. After I got off that

756
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:12,500
space mountain roller coaster, I'm just like, that was, that was really fun. So it's, I'm all right

757
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:17,300
with this. All right. So what are we doing? I mean, what do you want to do? Do you think

758
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:22,659
Jerma would play Terraria for like a hundred hours required to like learn it for the first time?

759
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:30,180
I'm, I'm, I'm doing the community a service of showing him this great game and like a bite

760
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:35,699
size, the family size pack that he can enjoy. And it's, I, it's great. See, like I, I wouldn't have

761
01:56:35,699 --> 01:56:41,060
built it. I wouldn't have built like a big giant compound to have all these people. I don't even

762
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:45,699
know what have these people do. I don't even know what have these people do. I just know they're

763
01:56:45,699 --> 01:56:53,539
here and it's all right. Cool. Okay. Okay. Hold on. I gotta remember how to build the ravager.

764
01:56:54,100 --> 01:57:16,359
Replace the emblem, the guarding Avenger emblem, 12% increased damage to defense.

765
01:57:17,239 --> 01:57:27,270
Is this sucks? I mean, this thing doesn't do anything. I have so many better options than

766
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:43,800
just 12% more damage. Let me see. What can I turn it into? Mechanical glove,

767
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:52,600
melee speed. So I need to take this, take this and figure out how to upgrade that.

768
01:57:52,600 --> 01:58:01,590
Cause we should have all this stuff to upgrade it. I was working on that, but I'm getting sidetracked

769
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:06,229
by like 30 things. Mechanical glove increases melee knockback, 12% damage and melee speed.

770
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:32,939
That sounds pretty good to me. Let's make it. We do have to be like one of these special

771
01:58:33,899 --> 01:58:41,430
crafting benches or something. Um, it should be right here. This anvil,

772
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:46,229
I think either that or it's way over here. The tinker is table instead. It's a tinker.

773
01:58:47,109 --> 01:58:56,359
Actually, what am I doing? I know what I'm doing. Mechanical glove. There it is.

774
01:58:57,159 --> 01:59:15,539
Okay. So now I can, I mean, that's a lot. That's very fast. Okay. Looking good. Now

775
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:24,140
people are still yelling at me for these wings. What are those? Is that what they're saying? Um,

776
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:31,000
a little meaner, a little meaner than that. Uh, the one comment in particular said, um,

777
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,520
you are the stupidest person I've ever seen play this game. And then their name is not in chat

778
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:42,039
anymore. And so they're gone, I think. So, I mean, that was kind of like really like unfortunate,

779
01:59:42,039 --> 01:59:45,800
like, okay. Uh, Chris may well knock back and inflict fire damage and attack.

780
01:59:46,939 --> 01:59:58,579
I need a magma stone. Do we have any magma stones? Yeah. Here you go. Nice. All right. So

781
01:59:58,579 --> 02:00:02,659
I'm just going to make this like super thing. I think there's one more step after that.

782
02:00:02,659 --> 02:00:13,590
All right. My major is another step. Holy shit. Okay. Fire and consider this item.

783
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:25,609
What the fuck is that? Okay. Let's go here. Fire gauntlet. Elemental gauntlet. Do we have a

784
02:00:25,609 --> 02:00:37,939
Yharnam insignia? Uh, no, I think we're very close to having one. I forget how to make it.

785
02:00:43,829 --> 02:00:49,779
I'm doing my own thing. Okay. So what you gave me this Aegis thing. Yeah. It's immunity to fire

786
02:00:49,779 --> 02:00:56,699
blocks and knockback. 40% max life. Increase health. Supreme holy flame dash. Activate buffs

787
02:00:56,699 --> 02:01:01,100
to all damage. Crit chance. Any fan activities. Your movement speed. Increase enemy aggro.

788
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:11,189
Okay. I forget this. What was that? Why did I just did that in a turn tonight? I did that.

789
02:01:11,989 --> 02:01:16,699
I thought it'd be funny. It's my gauntlet. My gauntlet versus the giver to the wings,

790
02:01:16,699 --> 02:01:20,859
right? Because I don't, what's the point of having this if I have the flying saucer, right? Oh yeah.

791
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:27,020
True. Do you have a melee? Which is broom, which is better.

792
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:37,640
I'm forgetting how to actually make the good wings. Oh, we need luminite bars.

793
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:41,079
It's pendant. I don't need this pendant anymore either. I have like a useless pendant.

794
02:01:42,119 --> 02:01:51,930
I got a couple of useless things. Oh my God. Let's just see how it goes. I'm willing. Let's

795
02:01:51,930 --> 02:01:54,970
just, let's give it a little attempt here. I got more health, like a better armor.

796
02:01:56,710 --> 02:02:14,970
So let's do some, let's go attack something. God damn it. I had to do this the long way.

797
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:20,550
I mean the long way. I think I turned off that other mod. I'm not using minions,

798
02:02:20,550 --> 02:02:24,869
so why are you using the amulet? Is it, do we have anything that's better than this in the stash?

799
02:02:25,829 --> 02:02:28,710
Better than what? Just, I have a useless slot right now.

800
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:34,840
Just look through equipment and there's a couple things. There's an item that's 15% damage under

801
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:39,800
50% health, which you'll be at because the other item. There's, there's some other things in there.

802
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:49,779
Um, uh, there's a lot of toys in this toy box. What am I doing?

803
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:58,039
15% increased melee damage. Here it is right here. And more, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

804
02:02:59,479 --> 02:03:07,500
there's the fungal spore. Look at that item. It's like a mushroom head. Your weapons don't count,

805
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:13,140
but you'll, you will get a weapon that will count. True melee weapons emit mushrooms when swung,

806
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:21,899
boost true melee damage by 25%. So what, what do you mean? True melee is like when your melee

807
02:03:21,899 --> 02:03:26,539
weapon actually hits something and not the projectiles that make, okay. All right.

808
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:33,750
Does that, that includes the axes too, right? Uh, no, I don't think the axes count.

809
02:03:38,779 --> 02:03:44,760
How you doing? Need help? Uh, we got to do the pillars again really fast.

810
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:56,100
Yes. We have to do the pillars again? Huh? Yeah. There's a, the only way to get luminite bars is

811
02:03:56,100 --> 02:04:01,460
to kill moon lord. And I had a mod where you could like buy moon lord packs, but I think I turned it

812
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:08,899
off and forgot about it. It's like the only way we can get luminite again to my knowledge is by

813
02:04:08,899 --> 02:04:19,430
doing all of the pillars to summon moon lord. Okay. I guess. Unless there's some other way to do it

814
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:24,739
that my mods enabled that I don't know of, but now that we're big strong boys, it goes really

815
02:04:24,739 --> 02:04:31,420
quickly. We are pretty strong. All right. Uh, the number one thing that that's going to need to

816
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:36,460
happen though, is it's going to need to actually swan the enemies. Uh, Hey, you wait here. You're

817
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:57,130
going to do another wait here, please. Jeremy. Oh my God. Bed. I got to pee so bad. My God. I'm

818
02:04:57,130 --> 02:05:19,880
going to pee my pants. I'll be, I'll be right there, bro. Um, dead. Okay. I'm getting off the

819
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:31,720
fucking thing. I don't, I don't even know what hit me. He's dead. They look gone. The super boost

820
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:37,989
accessory. Well, how did we get that? Super boost. Yeah. There's an item that lets you like run

821
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:44,789
as fast as you can see. It's ridiculous. Oh, why is there sand elementals coming out here?

822
02:05:46,439 --> 02:05:53,930
Oh, the Ragnarok boss dropped it. It might be expert only. Well, that was very easy. That was

823
02:05:53,930 --> 02:06:03,590
a very easy boss. I got it. Forbidden. I got to forbid something forbidden. You can craft it. I'll

824
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:09,270
see if I, maybe I picked it up or I would have to kill Ragnarok again. Or apparently I can craft it.

825
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:12,149
You guys might be thinking of something else because there's a couple of mods that add

826
02:06:12,149 --> 02:06:29,220
similar things. Forbidden fragments are outdated now. That's okay. Astral ore. I got like orange

827
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:39,739
shit. This thing's dead. So I'm coming back to town. Okay. All right. Um, I have to pee.

828
02:06:39,739 --> 02:06:44,699
So I'm going to go pee for the first time in my whole life. Go take a pee pee. I'll be right back.

829
02:06:51,159 --> 02:07:46,409
Um, I'm just going to kill Ragnarok again. I'm getting, I've got my adrenaline. It's a joke,

830
02:07:46,409 --> 02:07:56,859
by the way. You're supposed to laugh when I say that. Oh no, that boss doesn't drop it. I'm thinking

831
02:07:56,859 --> 02:08:02,260
of the second phase that drops that. Do you remember the name of it, Ashley? Because I would

832
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:10,789
just go to our other server and like grab it. Or you could do that and you could join me. You could

833
02:08:10,789 --> 02:08:14,949
like bring it here so I don't have to shut the server down and explain to Jerma how to join again.

834
02:08:14,949 --> 02:08:20,069
Joining. He like despises joining Terraria servers even though it's like a steam invite.

835
02:08:28,329 --> 02:08:33,300
I don't. I'm sure you could find it though. I would appreciate it very much and then we could

836
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:38,020
do your, your joke and then we can give it to him and I could, I could play the rest of the game

837
02:08:38,020 --> 02:09:11,319
with it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You'll get the fee. We don't need to tell him about that boss. Oh dude,

838
02:09:11,319 --> 02:09:15,800
does this thing drop Luminite? Is that what it was? Does this thing give fragments you don't have to

839
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:35,819
do? I remember that now. I'm going, I'm going to. I know he doesn't drop Luminite. I got some water.

840
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:51,659
I'm back. Hey, here. Maybe if you have an extra slot, there's that. Extra slot. That's right. I

841
02:09:51,659 --> 02:10:00,279
do not, but one of these I think is useless for me. Yes. He won't pick up the essence as will he?

842
02:10:00,279 --> 02:10:09,210
We have like 80 of every essence. Don't, don't worry guy. He doesn't know. Is there something

843
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:18,550
I should know? Sorry, is there something I need to know? No, there's nothing you need to know.

844
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:24,359
All right. Uh, chat, congratulations. You have just made, you're now on cool down. I will not

845
02:10:24,359 --> 02:10:32,600
look at chat for five straight minutes. I want like an on screen chat, cool down, read-o meter.

846
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:39,479
That would be awesome. We're like after five minutes to your stream would even say streamer

847
02:10:39,479 --> 02:10:44,760
must look at chat now. And then everyone would get their thing in. No, that would be a terrible

848
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:48,279
idea. Cause once I get the countdown, it would be like streamer look at chat now. And it would be

849
02:10:48,279 --> 02:10:54,600
like crazy spam and everyone would get out of their system. Then you could just like in good

850
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:59,800
conscious and look away again. Like, okay, that I'm right. I've read you. Do you really want the

851
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:07,130
only thing that you looked at ever to be like, Oh, W O or like streamer sucks or like a bunch

852
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:14,380
of coffee pasta? What else are they going to say? I see some really, really good shit in chat.

853
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:28,810
Sometimes. I don't know about you. Oh, well, it doesn't like, it would just like make you feel

854
02:11:28,810 --> 02:11:37,380
good inside though. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear you say that. I mean, like when a cute girl

855
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:49,539
looks at you and it's like, Oh, right. What are you saying? Uh, anyways, that's coming out of my

856
02:11:49,539 --> 02:11:55,720
video. You can keep that in yours if you want. I make one video. So that's coming out of it.

857
02:11:55,800 --> 02:12:01,479
That's not going in my video. You can put that in yours. I'm not. I've never made a video.

858
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:15,930
I get that clip. God, it's so easy with the challenge. By the way, while I was peeing,

859
02:12:15,930 --> 02:12:19,850
I decided that during the course of the P I was going to have a rating for Terraria.

860
02:12:21,449 --> 02:12:27,930
Didn't we do this though? We're done. This is the final Terraria stream. So I have to give my final

861
02:12:27,930 --> 02:12:32,649
score. And I, yeah, but before you were saying that you couldn't do it properly because it was,

862
02:12:34,090 --> 02:12:38,970
it was what you said, like you, you thought Terraria was like messy and like too chaotic.

863
02:12:38,970 --> 02:12:43,689
But I said, it's because there's mods and you've never played like basic Terraria and it was skewing

864
02:12:43,689 --> 02:12:48,489
your, your review. Yeah, that's fine. And you agreed, but now you're going to review it. Well,

865
02:12:48,489 --> 02:12:53,770
I have to say like my final thoughts on the game. We just get up behind the podium. The floor is

866
02:12:53,770 --> 02:12:58,649
yours. I'm going to give you some, uh, noise crowd noise here. Uh, sure.

867
02:13:06,010 --> 02:13:08,810
I think that was fun. I think I deserve something for that one. I really do.

868
02:13:11,770 --> 02:13:22,140
I think I deserve something for that. I don't know. Here, do it one more time.

869
02:13:22,539 --> 02:13:32,460
Click, click, click, click, click. Okay. Yeah, that was spot on. Thank you. But I

870
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:37,020
have no preparation at all. And you just do that on me. I come on. I think I deserve at least

871
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:42,539
like an extra letter grade higher on my, um, test for that one. Uh, people who missed this

872
02:13:42,539 --> 02:13:49,210
joke from before are really confused. That's all right. Uh, no, I worry about them because

873
02:13:49,210 --> 02:13:58,710
when I have to look at my child, I worry about them. Why haven't you ever just worried about

874
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:16,760
the one before? So we have to, uh, defeat moon, uh, the moon. I have to defeat the moon. Uh,

875
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:22,439
oh, oh, who's down there? Who's down there? That was me. Well, they're dead now.

876
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:36,010
So what's going on? You, are we, are we, uh, summoning? Do your best. Like the S like

877
02:14:36,010 --> 02:14:46,340
simplest thing. That is awful. No one wants to hear that. That was pretty good. That was really

878
02:14:46,340 --> 02:14:56,390
good. That was so good. I've never been like happier that I've said something there. That

879
02:14:56,390 --> 02:15:08,229
was perfect. I can't do that again, but just this time to say something, say like something, uh,

880
02:15:13,989 --> 02:15:26,149
why he's following me. I'm too far in the sky. I can't help you. You're like leading him away.

881
02:15:30,470 --> 02:15:40,470
Okay. Now I get to be the big brother. How do I hurt him? How do I hurt the moon guy?

882
02:15:41,189 --> 02:16:01,539
The brain go for the brain. How do you hurt this guy? You had a chance to be the big bro.

883
02:16:02,260 --> 02:16:07,960
What was that? Not hitting him in the right place. The brain, right? His right hand had a,

884
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:28,739
a little bit left on it. I need that. You don't even know what to do with it. Yeah, I don't.

885
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:39,379
Fair hurtful angels. And I need the Luma night moon Lord trophy, portal gun,

886
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:44,920
reckless terraria, which what is this? This is cool. This looks kind of cool.

887
02:16:45,479 --> 02:16:50,389
Here. You want, should I take this other onion? No, you can't use them again.

888
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:56,069
Sorry. Invite me. I, you can just join Ashley. You don't need to be invited here. Uh,

889
02:16:56,389 --> 02:17:13,030
what did you actually want? Luminate. I don't know. Is, is, is, is that a, uh,

890
02:17:15,129 --> 02:17:21,639
I'll find it eventually. I'm never picking up anything ever again. Thank you. Did you get it?

891
02:17:24,389 --> 02:17:30,040
No, I don't think so. You want to do all the pillars again because you picked this up and

892
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:38,250
like, you can't find it. I promise. I don't know where it is. Luminate, Luminate or I got there.

893
02:17:38,250 --> 02:18:09,110
He did not drop it. Oh my God. He's a good, this is a cool house. Did I just do all that

894
02:18:09,110 --> 02:18:28,489
for a pair of wings? Did you think so? Yeah, I think so. All right. So I've got this,

895
02:18:28,489 --> 02:18:33,909
this can be upgraded. What should I upgrade that to? That's the question that I have.

896
02:18:35,909 --> 02:18:56,420
The yo-yo. Oh, I want to see this insane knockback. Ruthless. This to thrower class

897
02:18:57,620 --> 02:19:05,620
somebody who uses it. You'll have this like save file from like five years.

898
02:19:06,659 --> 02:19:09,959
You'll have like some friend eventually that like it gets to this point and you're like,

899
02:19:09,959 --> 02:19:16,840
oh, I remember this. Actually, you saved a frog leg and I have no idea where you got it from.

900
02:19:17,559 --> 02:19:21,159
I had to like when me and Ash were playing come here and steal the frog leg because

901
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:28,440
I don't know what, where it's dropping in the mod, what's happening with it. You don't get those.

902
02:19:31,719 --> 02:19:35,799
All right, I did something. I think it's from fishing, but no one was fishing. It's like a

903
02:19:35,799 --> 02:19:40,120
mod added a different way to get a frog leg and he had it and it was in the storage and I don't

904
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:51,819
know why. I couldn't figure it out. I did something. All right, so what's happening now?

905
02:19:54,309 --> 02:20:05,379
You tell me. What do you want to do? What's the next like milestone? You tell me. I mean,

906
02:20:05,379 --> 02:20:17,139
this is all extra. We already beat the game. I mean, you tell me. I don't know where we go.

907
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:26,889
Can I talk to Lucy or are you in the, can I get in there? Can I get in there? Yeah, you can get

908
02:20:26,889 --> 02:20:40,219
in there. She's all yours. Let's see. I like this. Just get five of everything. Fuck it.

909
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:57,129
Archery, summoning. I don't need that anymore. I need like damage. Is it like a melee damage

910
02:20:57,129 --> 02:21:02,260
potion that I haven't been taking? There's a crumbling potion in the calamity mod

911
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:06,420
potions. That's really good lowers defense when you melee hit. Oh, that sounds cool.

912
02:21:06,979 --> 02:21:24,010
I'll go do that. All right. Calamity mod pots. It's not going to let me connect.

913
02:21:25,270 --> 02:21:37,159
Do you have the item, Ashley? What is it called? You wouldn't have it. Can you put it somewhere

914
02:21:37,159 --> 02:21:43,579
that I can just like shut the server down for a second and go get it? Or what's the name of it?

915
02:21:50,790 --> 02:22:00,819
Crumbling, crumbling. Right, right, right. Oh yeah. Ashley, what's the name of it?

916
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:14,069
I'll just look up how to get it. It's cool. Yeah, I'm just gonna get all this shit.

917
02:22:14,549 --> 02:22:37,139
This stuff looks insane. Does Star have VR? Yes, we mean Star played VR before.

918
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:47,049
We've done a multiplayer virtual reality stream. We played tennis. That was that was a hoop.

919
02:22:49,700 --> 02:22:52,739
Oh yeah, it has to be expert mode. So I'm going to change it to expert mode.

920
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:59,430
What? Why are you doing that? So I can get an item from Ragnarok.

921
02:22:59,430 --> 02:23:23,190
An item from Ragnarok. Oh, we have the stuff for this. It's in one minute. He's going to read the

922
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:53,639
chat. Get your oo's ready. Get them ready. Yes. Where are we going? Hold on. I'm doing shit.

923
02:23:55,180 --> 02:24:25,299
So guys, donuts next to me. What? Let's go fight stuff. I'm going to test my might.

924
02:24:25,299 --> 02:24:29,940
I like really specifically need a thorium anvil. I'm going to like punch someone in the freaking

925
02:24:29,940 --> 02:25:13,049
mouth. If I like a soul forge isn't good enough. Okay. It's the name of my mind. You gotta have it.

926
02:25:13,049 --> 02:25:58,950
No. Jarrah's bored in his own stream. No, what? I love doing that. Like turn on friendly fire and

927
02:25:58,950 --> 02:26:07,719
get him. Okay, here we go. Hey Star, turn on friendly fire for a second. I don't want to

928
02:26:07,719 --> 02:26:30,040
just take to lose nothing. Wait till he turns it on. What the fuck was that?

929
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:46,379
Okay. Why is Chewbacca in this game? 30 years later. Okay. Jarrah, I'm tired. Can I go to

930
02:26:46,379 --> 02:26:53,620
sleep please? Yeah. You can go to bed. And now I can't make the Ragnarok emblem. What am I missing?

931
02:27:01,610 --> 02:27:08,899
And now I will do a series of voices while I drink water. Here we go.

932
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:44,440
I can't believe it. I know. Absolutely amazing. Start up. We don't have vortex fragments. What?

933
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:55,209
When did that happen? Everybody. Jarrah stole them all. Nobody likes that one. Well, that was a

934
02:27:55,209 --> 02:27:59,209
board joke. That wasn't a real joke. You want a real job. Jarrah, did you steal all the vortex

935
02:27:59,209 --> 02:28:07,430
fragments? Uh, yeah. I walked by them because they were on the ground. Oh, give it to me.

936
02:28:08,149 --> 02:28:12,579
What the hell are you doing, little bro? I just picked them up. What just happened?

937
02:28:17,030 --> 02:28:21,750
Yes. And here's the other ones he dropped. I promise I didn't just try to throw them down the

938
02:28:21,750 --> 02:28:32,219
well. And for my next drink. Okay. Uh, you have not seen this boss before. Ooh, new material.

939
02:29:02,709 --> 02:29:16,340
Oh, did you even make good wings, did you? You didn't get good wings. No. And here comes

940
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:34,389
dying reality. What's dying reality? Oh, the Ragnarok. Where is this enemy we're fighting?

941
02:29:35,190 --> 02:29:38,790
It's the circle with the health bar that's right next to you. And because every enemy

942
02:29:38,790 --> 02:29:49,379
follows you for some reason. Whoa. I insta died. Like I had full health. What happened? Holy shit.

943
02:29:50,819 --> 02:30:04,729
When you say you had full health, you mean you had half health? No, I had like at least

944
02:30:04,729 --> 02:30:15,100
like 80, 70% or 80%. I got really at least got to see the fireworks. Okay. I got the thing.

945
02:30:15,819 --> 02:30:26,790
You got a thing that you were looking for? I got the thing that I was looking for. Nice. Now my

946
02:30:26,790 --> 02:30:34,120
wife is happy. I got a Ragnarok treasure bag. Should I open it? Yeah. And then you're going

947
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:43,879
to want to put on the Omega core. Whoa. The Omega core raises movement speed beyond comprehension.

948
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:54,620
What do I replace? Are you wearing boots? Wait, it takes the place of boots. You don't need boots

949
02:30:54,620 --> 02:31:05,610
anymore. Um, I don't, I don't like this. I can't use this. This is why I can't play Sonic the Hedgehog.

950
02:31:05,610 --> 02:31:10,920
This is Sonic the Hedgehog levels of speed. Well, you have to play with it until the game's over

951
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:16,520
now. That's what Ashley says. And I mean, does this work in my spaceship? Who runs the world? Girls,

952
02:31:17,399 --> 02:31:29,620
does this work in the spaceship? No, it doesn't. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, but it's

953
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:38,579
okay. I will deal with it. It's cool though. Nice. You sound like entranced. What about the

954
02:31:38,579 --> 02:31:44,020
master tides? Here, I'm going to make you good wings. Do you even want wings? Are you going to

955
02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:49,540
be in your like a dummy? I mean, the UFOs, these wings are faster than UFO. Just take this stuff

956
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:56,840
because I don't know what it does. Yes. Give me the wings. We're done with this horse shit.

957
02:31:58,280 --> 02:32:06,979
Thanks for making me throw up. I'm sorry. I didn't want to do the Sonic the Hedgehog

958
02:32:06,979 --> 02:32:20,709
super speed thing. Here's wings. Angry Stardust wings allows flight and snowfall. Great value.

959
02:32:20,709 --> 02:32:38,469
Okay. What should this replace? What should this replace? I don't know, dude. True melee damage.

960
02:32:39,270 --> 02:32:55,860
More. I'm exploring the world. I keep hitting planets. Place the shroom. No, I want to place

961
02:32:55,860 --> 02:33:09,690
this Omega core. Is this faster than the spaceship? It is. Yeah, it is. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for trying

962
02:33:09,690 --> 02:33:17,239
it before asking the question. Okay. You're ready. Um, hold on. I can take the shroom off.

963
02:33:18,200 --> 02:33:29,909
Okay. Oh, I got to take off my dash. My dash like very randomly throws me

964
02:33:30,790 --> 02:33:36,469
in a, this is, I would, I would quantify this. I would quantify this as not fun. I'm gonna take

965
02:33:36,469 --> 02:33:45,930
them off. I'm dead. I just ran into the side. So did I. The dash is what's getting me.

966
02:33:46,809 --> 02:33:55,829
I would quantify that is breaks the game to a point where it's, it's, it hurts me. It hurts me

967
02:33:55,909 --> 02:34:08,569
to do this. I can't even pick up this stuff on the, can we take this off? I don't know.

968
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:22,649
I don't know what's giving me the dash, but now I'm really slow. This one. I'm so slow now though.

969
02:34:26,819 --> 02:34:53,559
Man, I'm too fast. I'm too slow. Put the boots back on instead of this room. Baby rage, baby rage.

970
02:34:55,819 --> 02:35:05,739
Make the angel threads. Star, can you make me the angel threads? Yeah. Thanks. You already made them.

971
02:35:06,379 --> 02:35:18,219
I mean, yeah, I've been wearing them. I took them off for the Omega core. Oh, that was dumb.

972
02:35:23,180 --> 02:35:27,899
I am the alpha and the Omega, right? Is that what you always used to say to me?

973
02:35:29,459 --> 02:35:34,020
I don't think I've ever said those words. No, like whenever you're making a video and you want it,

974
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:38,180
something to be a certain way, you just say, I am the alpha and the Omega. And then you always got

975
02:35:38,180 --> 02:35:46,229
what you want it in a mean voice or in like a, just like telling you that no, like a holier than bow

976
02:35:46,229 --> 02:35:57,850
kind of thing. I am the alpha and the Omega. Okay, hello. There's more light. So what's next?

977
02:35:59,420 --> 02:36:31,989
Ravager. Ravager. I love shooting the bubbles. So hard to control. It's funny. Like I, I,

978
02:36:31,989 --> 02:36:41,270
I fly up so slowly and yet if I tap left or right, I'm gone. I almost just whacked it. No, no, no,

979
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:50,659
no, no, no, no, no, no. I was saying it and he crushed my God. And my next trick,

980
02:36:51,219 --> 02:36:56,200
I am going to drink a glass of water while Star does voices. Be amazed.

981
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:00,680
Don't make mouth noises into the mic, Jerma.

982
02:37:03,500 --> 02:37:26,389
Well, it was close. I added an extra one. I did the part after that. I was, that was the next part

983
02:37:26,389 --> 02:37:37,139
of the, of the, I'm proud of you that you could admit that you did it wrong. Why is everybody

984
02:37:37,139 --> 02:37:42,819
blaming me for the gross noise you made? I was just drinking water and you did the gross noise.

985
02:37:42,819 --> 02:37:46,340
I didn't do that. No, you like prepared noises for your drink because you thought it would be

986
02:37:46,340 --> 02:37:51,379
funny. And if it didn't go, like your joke didn't stick. I said you to do voices, not go like,

987
02:37:54,790 --> 02:37:58,709
I said Star is going to do voices while I drink out of this cup. And then you just made a bunch

988
02:37:58,709 --> 02:38:09,450
of mouth noises. That wasn't a voice. What? So it's my fault. No, it's both of our faults.

989
02:38:09,450 --> 02:38:13,850
Yeah. You're really fun to work with. Hey, anyone want to do any like work with Jerma?

990
02:38:14,809 --> 02:38:20,280
We'll throw you under the bus. Yeah. I've like read, I've read a bunch of shit about Jerma.

991
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:23,959
Like I like his streams and everything, but he's apparently really, really hard to work with.

992
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:29,479
He's like notorious, like throwing tantrums on before broadcasts and everything. He's really

993
02:38:29,479 --> 02:38:33,000
hard to work with. You wouldn't believe the things you said to me before we started today.

994
02:38:33,719 --> 02:38:38,280
Like even I bet I've met him at like events and parties and he's like a super dick.

995
02:38:39,239 --> 02:38:50,360
Yeah. I know why we didn't play for three weeks. Broad, bro, mega low caster.

996
02:38:55,989 --> 02:39:07,620
I swear to you, I made an onk. Did you? I think you did. I do remember that. No, you weren't here.

997
02:39:13,159 --> 02:39:18,280
I'm just trying to, to seem like we're working together. I'm just trying to make it seem like

998
02:39:19,399 --> 02:39:23,319
we're, Hey, we're doing this thing. I remember you made the onky. You weren't here for that.

999
02:39:23,399 --> 02:39:28,600
He just threw me under the bus. Well, I'm not going to let you lie to everyone.

1000
02:39:32,010 --> 02:39:34,889
Here it is again. Jerma like wants to look good in front of everyone,

1001
02:39:36,280 --> 02:39:43,979
even if it means his friends have to lie for him. Okay. And we're going to kill the ravager.

1002
02:39:44,780 --> 02:39:51,579
Oh, again, that was fun when we died both together. Like we didn't do it. Dude, I can't,

1003
02:39:51,579 --> 02:40:00,409
I can't control. All right. I'm ready. All right. Come on. I'm getting, I'm getting

1004
02:40:00,409 --> 02:40:06,090
damage reduction. You just said to do it. And I activated my pots. It'll be like two seconds.

1005
02:40:06,090 --> 02:40:14,340
I only have three minutes. It takes longer than three minutes. I'm setting up my minds.

1006
02:40:14,979 --> 02:41:06,729
Okay. You ready? Who is that? Let's do it again. Oh my God. He just disappeared because I went

1007
02:41:06,729 --> 02:41:38,489
too far. God damn it. I can't not go that far. I can only hear this in my one ear. How far would

1008
02:41:38,489 --> 02:42:01,379
you go? I need to hear this. I'm right here. That wasn't that bad. That was nothing. Are you

1009
02:42:01,379 --> 02:42:26,440
fighting? Yeah. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I feel like a snail when I, when I fly up. Get the fuck away

1010
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:35,860
from the guy. Get away from the guy. What's this guy? This guy following me. They come through the

1011
02:42:35,860 --> 02:43:17,370
fucking goddamn things. I'm too fast. Don't die. Don't run away. Nice. Nice. The ravager.

1012
02:43:19,590 --> 02:43:26,629
You do 20% more damage. Take 20% less damage. Do 20% more lifesteal. Take a hundred percent

1013
02:43:26,629 --> 02:43:42,569
more damage when you are not standing still. Fucking cool item. Gain an increase to all damage

1014
02:43:42,569 --> 02:43:47,370
reduce light wing time. All right. Whatever. Oh, he drops blood stones. That's what it was.

1015
02:43:48,170 --> 02:44:04,709
Blood ocean. Blood orb. And the phantom heart. Ravager is pinwheel. We don't have blood orbs?

1016
02:44:05,690 --> 02:44:15,159
How do we not have blood orbs, Jerma? I can't even get in this hole. Is this,

1017
02:44:15,159 --> 02:44:19,819
is this a joke where I have this in my inventory and I don't know? I don't think so.

1018
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:32,459
Nah, I bought a bunch. Is stir going to fight the four celestial towers? Nope. I'm sorry. I'm gonna be,

1019
02:44:33,340 --> 02:44:39,100
I have to, I gotta butt in here and fix that. Is stir and then in parentheses after that

1020
02:44:39,739 --> 02:44:45,420
and watching Jerma and parentheses going to do, I just want to be, I want to clear up what you just

1021
02:44:45,420 --> 02:45:02,520
said. Okay. Stir and parentheses and Jerma's eyes and then, and parentheses. I mean, I am watching.

1022
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:18,229
I am seeing it happen. Is stir and then parentheses and Jerma's respawn scream

1023
02:45:18,229 --> 02:45:24,889
and parentheses going to continue to do the celestial? That's so funny. That's a good one.

1024
02:45:26,229 --> 02:45:29,030
Typically I would fucking time you out for something like that and making fun of the

1025
02:45:29,030 --> 02:45:43,239
streamer. But I mean, come on, that's pretty good. Are you using that 25%

1026
02:45:43,319 --> 02:45:50,120
intramally thing? Uh, no. Would you like it? No, I'm just, you might want to.

1027
02:45:51,479 --> 02:45:58,299
I have the angel treads, the fire gauntlet. Here, take this weapon. Okay.

1028
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:10,579
This thing is too, all right. I will have to reforge it. Seven,

1029
02:46:10,659 --> 02:46:18,709
17, was it 1770, 1662. Is that the year you were born?

1030
02:46:21,049 --> 02:46:27,799
Just give out your password on stream. I don't have 39 gold. What the hell?

1031
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:40,569
I, I dropped a lot of my money. So did I. Do we have any platinum left in the bank? We don't,

1032
02:46:40,569 --> 02:46:50,709
we don't have any money. You know how to fix that. Sell, uh, something I have. Honestly, like sell

1033
02:46:50,709 --> 02:46:58,569
all that. No, I don't want you to do that. Nevermind. They just called this a pleb house.

1034
02:47:00,170 --> 02:47:13,899
We use a Zerg potion and just kill everything. Okay. They know it'll get in here.

1035
02:47:15,479 --> 02:47:30,389
Oh, it'll be able to get in here. I didn't know this was like a artillery thing. Doesn't,

1036
02:47:30,389 --> 02:47:35,190
I can't remember what bow I was using in the other game, where I got it from. Anyway, we got

1037
02:47:35,190 --> 02:47:45,190
to go to space. Space. That means I get to be in this. I think we need cosplay. So we'll just

1038
02:47:45,190 --> 02:47:54,870
hurry this up and, ah, okay. So the storm weaver has awoken. Hopefully he doesn't instantly run

1039
02:47:54,870 --> 02:48:04,540
away. But he's a two faced worm that comes up to space to fight you. Why am I, why am I still in

1040
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:12,540
that? I, what am I, get out of the, um, I was trying to get out of the fucking UFO and like,

1041
02:48:12,540 --> 02:48:21,719
I got, uh, I was in the UFO, which was slow as shit. I'm, I'm throwing it in the trash

1042
02:48:21,719 --> 02:48:41,780
so I don't do that again. I heard that burp. Hey, did you come up here and pick up items?

1043
02:48:41,780 --> 02:48:49,530
I'm going to scream at you. I came up. Why, what did I do? What did you pick up? I don't know. I

1044
02:48:49,530 --> 02:48:55,049
just came back up here and I ended up coming. What did you pick up? Armored shell, storm dragon,

1045
02:48:55,690 --> 02:49:02,739
Mag, uh, Magnum rounds. Drop it off. Just drop it off. Do you think I'm not going to take care of

1046
02:49:02,739 --> 02:49:14,309
you? I think that's pretty much it. Is that what it is? I don't know if I got that now. I don't

1047
02:49:14,309 --> 02:49:39,219
know if I got that too. Okay. We've got to go to hell. Okay. What the hell was that? You can't hurt

1048
02:49:39,219 --> 02:50:14,950
them. What's that? Oh my boat does not even work here. You're gonna kill it. I'm trying. It's a

1049
02:50:14,950 --> 02:50:40,969
ghost. I thought you were like a fan of that movie. I'm not afraid to know ghosts. Remember

1050
02:50:40,969 --> 02:50:52,840
that one? Should I go, should I respond and pick everything up again? Did you? No. Okay. Okay. So

1051
02:50:52,840 --> 02:50:57,959
now where are we going? So that you can summon the other boss and then this is like the boss

1052
02:51:00,520 --> 02:51:16,100
before the boss. Hold on. Let me just, let me die again. Waiting for you to die. Okay. So what,

1053
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:26,229
what are we doing now? I'm trying to remember how to summon the boss. You just made a pizza.

1054
02:51:26,229 --> 02:51:37,500
Want some? That just doesn't sound bad. Armored shell, twisting nether. Did I get twisting nether?

1055
02:51:38,219 --> 02:51:48,040
I should have it. I don't have the drops from the boss. What? I got a hellstone brick. Yeah,

1056
02:51:48,040 --> 02:51:56,780
I got an unholy essence. Twisting nether. I don't know where that is. Yeah, the boss we just fought

1057
02:51:56,780 --> 02:52:00,139
should have dropped twisting nether. Did you pick it up? I have it. Okay. You threw it to me.

1058
02:52:00,700 --> 02:52:10,760
I just did it. Thank you. Thank you, little bro. You're welcome. I need potions. We didn't get any

1059
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:21,510
money, did we? Not really, no. We're gonna, we're gonna need them. This is a tough fight.

1060
02:52:22,389 --> 02:52:30,600
When I say before, like, oh, he's setting up. Listen to me. This is a tough fight. Sounds fun.

1061
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:52,569
We do need money, though. I need potions. I don't have any. I have healing potions,

1062
02:52:52,569 --> 02:52:59,420
but not anything else. I mean, like, does it matter? I'm kind of, you said this is the hardest thing

1063
02:52:59,420 --> 02:53:06,139
we've done. Yeah. How am I supposed to do the hardest thing we've ever done without my, like,

1064
02:53:06,139 --> 02:53:15,700
15 potions I drink before each boss? The devourer of gods made me bite my desk, and there are several

1065
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:32,280
bite marks. He's right. He's right. Insane chat. Let's get you some money. Insane chat. I just

1066
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:37,159
imagine the front of your desk with just, like, teeth impressions from the dentist office,

1067
02:53:37,159 --> 02:53:46,010
just all over the front. How do you explain that to anybody, by the way? If anybody comes over

1068
02:53:46,010 --> 02:53:49,530
your house and goes in your room and goes to your desk, there are bite marks all over your desk. What

1069
02:53:49,530 --> 02:53:55,860
are you going to tell them? Come to me. That's what I'm going to tell them. That's what you can

1070
02:53:55,860 --> 02:54:20,819
earn some cash. You can tell them you have a flavored desk. I mean, that would be, you could

1071
02:54:20,819 --> 02:54:50,229
say that. But would they believe you? Then they'd want to try it. You getting money? Yeah, I think

1072
02:54:50,229 --> 02:54:59,159
so. I'll be honest. I have no idea. This is a better way to do this. All I know is there are,

1073
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:05,079
my screen's full of things. I don't know what I think. Things are happening. That's all I know.

1074
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:27,319
There's a better way to do this. Hold on. Get in there. Please don't spam the chat.

1075
02:55:28,940 --> 02:55:34,620
I think I have some money now. I've got 17 gold, which is not a whole lot, but it's something.

1076
02:55:35,579 --> 02:55:46,940
Murray, where did you go? How much do you have? 17 gold. 19 gold. Yeah, it's on the down.

1077
02:55:50,389 --> 02:56:00,040
Hold on. I've got a plan. Have you ever wanted to eat something non-edible, like nice smelling

1078
02:56:00,040 --> 02:56:12,500
soap? Yes. There is a store that sells soap. If you guys have ever heard of Lush, there's a

1079
02:56:12,500 --> 02:56:18,579
chain of, they've got all kinds of weird, like cheese soaps in there. And by cheese soap,

1080
02:56:18,579 --> 02:56:23,940
I mean, they have these gigantic wheels of soap cheese that sit on these mantles and they have

1081
02:56:23,940 --> 02:56:30,180
to carve off of these giant soap wheels. You know, just stuff for your shower, your bath,

1082
02:56:30,180 --> 02:56:37,459
or whatever. There is a lemon zest candy smelling soap cheese wheel thing in there.

1083
02:56:39,940 --> 02:56:43,379
I feel like if you ate it, it would be okay.

1084
02:56:45,940 --> 02:56:54,389
Probably. You'd probably get a really bad stomach ache, but that first bite would be like,

1085
02:56:54,469 --> 02:57:01,780
hmm. But then you, yeah, after about five seconds, you'd be like, wait, no, no, no, no.

1086
02:57:02,819 --> 02:57:08,950
But they have like a honey. They've got this like honey smelling soap. It looks like a honeycomb.

1087
02:57:08,950 --> 02:57:14,920
It looks so delicious. When's the last time you ate one of these?

1088
02:57:15,719 --> 02:57:19,159
I've never because that's a bad idea. You shouldn't do that. Nobody should do that.

1089
02:57:19,159 --> 02:57:23,000
How do you know that that's a bad idea? Because it's, oh, you had the electro

1090
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:29,239
Roombas in here the whole time. You fucking god. It's chemicals and you don't eat chemicals.

1091
02:57:29,239 --> 02:57:35,879
It's a stupid idea. Don't do that. German doesn't even know that the electro Roombas

1092
02:57:35,879 --> 02:57:42,680
give you like 40 platinum. Add that to the list of things that I don't fucking know in this game.

1093
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:55,620
12 platinum for selling these like, come on, dude. Come on. I got so mad at my apple. I gave it bite

1094
02:57:55,620 --> 02:58:11,290
marks. Biting my desk. I can't imagine. First of all, what kind of desk do you have?

1095
02:58:13,299 --> 02:58:16,420
If you don't have a wooden desk, that's even more concerning.

1096
02:58:22,440 --> 02:58:28,120
It's a grape desk. Oh, I know that. I know those. It's a cheesecake desk.

1097
02:58:29,500 --> 02:58:37,989
You know, there's some fucked up billionaire in the world that has like a food office.

1098
02:58:42,200 --> 02:58:46,200
This shit doesn't even work. He goes in there and pretends to go on his

1099
02:58:47,399 --> 02:58:55,750
like hamburger fucking mice, his cheesecake desk, his monitors. They're made out of like glass candy.

1100
02:58:56,790 --> 02:59:01,270
He doesn't do anything in there. He just goes in there and just goes, yeah, I could afford this.

1101
02:59:01,350 --> 02:59:04,629
And like it takes one bite and then somebody goes in there and replaces it.

1102
02:59:05,829 --> 02:59:19,270
Come on, dude. Come on. Oh, I can't believe you know the platinum thing.

1103
02:59:25,719 --> 02:59:33,209
Help, help them. These people, they mean nothing to me. Holy shit. That guy just shot that dude in

1104
02:59:33,209 --> 02:59:47,690
the face. Damn. I don't mean anything to me. What fucked up thing would I do if I was a billionaire?

1105
02:59:48,780 --> 02:59:53,500
Okay, get up here and then you can tell us all about German world. No, um,

1106
02:59:54,139 --> 03:00:02,809
it's all there. Wait, we don't have a money problem anymore. What? Why are you summoning

1107
03:00:02,809 --> 03:00:21,930
plant? I'm going in. There's a view somewhere. I don't, I don't know where. Why are you sending

1108
03:00:21,930 --> 03:00:29,370
plant arrow? Oh, they didn't drop anything. I was just summoning a bunch of them so that we could

1109
03:00:29,370 --> 03:00:35,370
sell everything they dropped for money. And then they didn't drop anything. I would put it into

1110
03:00:35,370 --> 03:00:46,809
like dragon egg research, try to like hatch a dragon. I know this doesn't even work like,

1111
03:00:46,889 --> 03:00:58,299
oh, that guy didn't even get a chance. What am I, what am I doing with myself?

1112
03:00:58,299 --> 03:01:06,059
This is all so that you could buy potions. Come here, son. Take six platinum. Wait.

1113
03:01:14,950 --> 03:01:21,530
Wait, that's not what I want. And then we're going to fight the God worm. God worm. Nice.

1114
03:01:22,489 --> 03:01:26,489
Uh, so what, what is the best, what's the best potions I should be buying and like having

1115
03:01:26,489 --> 03:01:33,290
actually, uh, the Yarnham stimulant, the crumbling potion, yarnings, titan, crumbling, invincibility,

1116
03:01:33,290 --> 03:01:53,239
wrath, endurance, Yarnham, Yarnham stimulus, calamity. What else? The photosynthesis,

1117
03:01:54,040 --> 03:02:05,540
soaring. Just get one each. One of each. Get one. I'm just going to buy one of each.

1118
03:02:06,500 --> 03:02:20,260
Nevermind. Um, what's going on with chat? I accidentally, oh, okay. What? That's not,

1119
03:02:20,260 --> 03:02:28,069
that's not going to happen here. All right. Uh, fortitude. No, non-calamity.

1120
03:02:29,030 --> 03:02:37,049
I want my regular potions now. Where's the old guy?

1121
03:02:37,850 --> 03:03:03,239
What's this? Wrath. Max life. You ready? Um, hold on. Titan. Okay. I'm gonna like see how many

1122
03:03:03,239 --> 03:03:07,479
laps I can do around the fucking planet. Cause I'm the flash before like my friends, right?

1123
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:29,379
Who also mutes himself. I hit L. I hit L. All right. Okay. Now let's do it. I'm coming to you.

1124
03:03:31,340 --> 03:03:35,719
You're already here. Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Let's do this. So what are we doing? What's the,

1125
03:03:35,719 --> 03:03:41,239
what is this thing that we're currently doing? It's, it's a worm. The worm. All right. It's the

1126
03:03:41,239 --> 03:04:04,500
worm. I'm ready. Let's worm it up. Holy shit. It's fast. I'm scared. I drew, I brought it to

1127
03:04:04,500 --> 03:04:09,139
the other side of the world. What? By accident. It was fast enough to like go the whole way. It's

1128
03:04:09,139 --> 03:04:23,639
coming. I haven't, I haven't seen it. I have, I don't even know what it looks like. Oh, there it

1129
03:04:23,639 --> 03:04:50,020
is. Okay. This is phase one. Phase one. Yeah. This thing is long. It's too long. I'm trying,

1130
03:04:50,020 --> 03:04:55,700
I'm trying to let my little brother fight it. So I'm like staying still near this area. He was

1131
03:04:55,700 --> 03:05:07,700
covering the whole ground. That thing was long. Holy shit. My brother, I haven't even seen what

1132
03:05:07,700 --> 03:05:18,860
it looks like. Okay, boy. Oh, all the guys are dead. Oh, I kind of needed potions. Whatever.

1133
03:05:18,860 --> 03:05:32,709
Ready? Hold on a second. Okay. Does it like gain my speed or something? Cause it just suddenly

1134
03:05:32,709 --> 03:05:39,989
jumped like a million miles an hour when I flew up. Doesn't this thing match the speed of the

1135
03:05:39,989 --> 03:05:55,819
player? Yeah, I'm noticing that. Oh shit. Wow. I'm noticing it. I forgot to get to it.

1136
03:05:55,819 --> 03:06:02,309
I don't worry. German's muted again. You don't have to listen to him. How is that possible?

1137
03:06:02,309 --> 03:06:21,219
I didn't do anything. I didn't press L. It's head and tail take normal damage. Its body is

1138
03:06:21,219 --> 03:06:26,260
resistant. I mean, I still did all right damage, but he just kind of, he just did the snake thing.

1139
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:31,979
He just wrapped around and went. Oh shit. Somebody just gave a fucking hundred bucks.

1140
03:06:33,350 --> 03:06:37,430
Uh, amnestic. Oh w thanks for the a hundred dollars. Turn up the music.

1141
03:06:38,389 --> 03:06:44,899
I know I'm thanking somebody, but thank you so much. Sorry. I'm sorry. Fucking bucks.

1142
03:06:44,899 --> 03:07:01,750
But I brought it up. Turn up the music. Do what? Turn up the music there. I like need the potions.

1143
03:07:04,739 --> 03:07:10,010
I have eight of each like decent one. You want some, you want me to split them with you?

1144
03:07:11,590 --> 03:07:16,469
No, actually I have good enough ones. All right. So I think low now.

1145
03:07:18,149 --> 03:07:24,700
So he matches the speed of the player. Is that what you're saying? He might.

1146
03:07:25,500 --> 03:07:26,899
Okay. Well,

1147
03:07:33,930 --> 03:07:35,530
wrapping around.

1148
03:07:57,420 --> 03:08:01,989
It's like my flight time is lower than it should be. I still have the ravager thing in my inventory.

1149
03:08:02,950 --> 03:08:37,559
He's coming. Oh no, please. No dear God. I ran out of juice. Stay alive. Now I'm mad.

1150
03:08:40,920 --> 03:08:50,899
Holy fuck. I just almost instantly died. Can we do it? Does he not have a phase two or is

1151
03:08:50,899 --> 03:08:58,780
this phase two garbage on normal? Or wait, no, he summons all of these guys and then you get phase

1152
03:08:58,780 --> 03:09:20,700
two. What do you mean then? Leave me the fuck alone. I'm trying to eat this thing. Zero point.

1153
03:09:30,309 --> 03:09:47,000
Jesus Christ, man. It's fucking this is like intensity. The video game storm weaver.

1154
03:09:49,719 --> 03:09:56,500
Okay. Now it's now it's this guy that we fought before and then it's the guy again.

1155
03:09:57,459 --> 03:10:27,979
Yeah, where's he going to do this again? Yeah, except this time more. Oh Lord. Holy shit. I

1156
03:10:27,979 --> 03:10:32,860
just got fucking air shot. I'm dead.

1157
03:10:32,860 --> 03:11:06,149
Yeah. I think I saw this ravager shit in my cotton inventory. I can fly for like a second.

1158
03:11:06,149 --> 03:11:25,290
I'm going to bite my desk. You were warned. You're going to I'm going for it. Hey,

1159
03:11:25,290 --> 03:11:50,870
don't worry. He's at 80%. Oh, boy. I've really done it now. I've really done it now. I've done

1160
03:11:50,870 --> 03:12:03,399
it. Oh, now you've done it. Clicked out of my window so many times. Let's play.

1161
03:12:12,360 --> 03:12:22,219
I did it too. Fuck. I did not want to go into space. Please don't die, Jerma. Oh, no. I just

1162
03:12:22,219 --> 03:12:25,500
clicked out of my fucking window. Don't give me this counter responsibility with the giant worm.

1163
03:12:25,500 --> 03:12:53,510
I summoned the ravager by accident because if you hold down your mouse and you shoot at the top

1164
03:12:53,510 --> 03:12:59,030
left of your screen, it will click the things in your inventory. All right. Explain to me why

1165
03:12:59,030 --> 03:13:03,270
I just clicked out of my window again. Why in the name of fucking God is that possible?

1166
03:13:04,469 --> 03:13:13,180
Just playing full screen dummy. I almost just turned off my VPN accidentally and would have

1167
03:13:13,180 --> 03:13:25,450
like my stream were turned off. Lock the hot bar. How? I can't believe I actually summoned

1168
03:13:25,450 --> 03:13:38,540
ravager. What do I do? Oh, I never know. At least ravagers like these ones.

1169
03:13:46,809 --> 03:14:09,350
Jesus, I'm dead. Oh, where are you? Oh, I thought it was following me. Are you good? Yeah.

1170
03:14:13,100 --> 03:14:16,299
You've managed to go that way. Are you? Are you? Are you guys going that way?

1171
03:14:17,020 --> 03:14:25,860
Yeah, we're going this way. Going that way. Okay. I mean, sometimes life gives you lemons

1172
03:14:36,790 --> 03:14:43,500
out of the fucking window again. I don't know how I pressed like a different. I didn't even.

1173
03:14:43,500 --> 03:14:59,059
I pressed like a different mouse button. Are you doing this way? Okay. Why is he in the background?

1174
03:14:59,059 --> 03:15:09,100
He's too good for you. Jesus, man. I'm going to die again here. You want to bite your desk?

1175
03:15:11,319 --> 03:15:25,500
Not yet. No. Don't die. Oh, duh. I'm okay. I really wish I had those boots I gave to

1176
03:15:25,500 --> 03:15:39,000
Jerma right now. Are you good? Are you coming? I'm respawning. You good? Are you good? You back?

1177
03:15:39,799 --> 03:16:39,860
My lord, I'm going to die. I'm dead. And I am. Spawned again. Oh, I almost had a holy fire or

1178
03:16:39,860 --> 03:16:47,610
whatever. Oh, my fingers just hitting so many buttons. It's too intense for me. Did we lose?

1179
03:16:48,649 --> 03:17:00,819
Yeah. This loss seems very not fun. It's fun. It's just too much health. And I couldn't have.

1180
03:17:01,620 --> 03:17:05,299
I think we could both have much better weapons and accessories by now, but I've skipped so much

1181
03:17:05,299 --> 03:17:23,180
stuff. It's too much for my brain. I'm down close though. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, our potions

1182
03:17:23,180 --> 03:17:28,219
probably ran out. I didn't even realize. That takes forever. I usually take another one after

1183
03:17:28,219 --> 03:17:40,040
I spawn back. You want to give up right there? Is that the I give up in Terraria? I mean,

1184
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:44,680
or we sit here and wait for all the NPCs to respawn and do something else?

1185
03:17:45,319 --> 03:17:53,799
Oh, they're all dead. No, they're all dead. That was our one chance to kill the god.

1186
03:17:54,360 --> 03:18:00,280
Here, let me get my main. Go get your main. Do it. Go get my main. Go get, okay, go get your like,

1187
03:18:00,280 --> 03:18:19,420
your decked out in full raid gear character. Are you actually going to do that? Yeah. I don't

1188
03:18:19,420 --> 03:18:24,139
remember the items I had. I'm like curious. I lost connection to you. Yes, I had to leave.

1189
03:18:24,139 --> 03:18:33,049
You killed the moon lord. So technically you did it. Yeah. No, it was fun. Yeah. So that

1190
03:18:33,049 --> 03:18:42,780
was the guy who beat Dark Souls on stream that devour of gods. Right. Is that is that like one

1191
03:18:42,780 --> 03:18:49,690
of the last boss two more after him. So there's two more bosses to end the whole thing. Yeah.

1192
03:18:49,690 --> 03:18:56,899
Damn. One of them is a there's one hard boss after that. That's a dragon yarn.

1193
03:18:58,100 --> 03:19:02,899
And then after that is like that. I have fuck you. You put this way that I'd like I didn't even

1194
03:19:02,899 --> 03:19:07,700
feel like crafting shit for. I was just like, I don't I'm not interested. That's cool, though.

1195
03:19:07,700 --> 03:19:10,899
There's a lot of content in this game. There's a lot of stuff to do.

1196
03:19:16,100 --> 03:19:19,219
Are you actually going to get your man or is that it? Yeah, the server is up.

1197
03:19:20,420 --> 03:19:38,489
I should be able just to join you, right? Yeah. I'm using this. Oh, this. Oh, true. Oh, yeah. This

1198
03:19:38,489 --> 03:19:47,209
was like crashing my computer because I had to replace my way when I had to replace my power

1199
03:19:47,209 --> 03:19:52,889
supply, I lowered an underclocked all my hardware and shooting this bow was bringing the server

1200
03:19:52,889 --> 03:20:02,229
down to like 10. Yes. Let me see. Where are you? That's you. All of those are homing arrows.

1201
03:20:02,229 --> 03:20:08,709
So like the game just kind of freaks out one up. Also, you can have. I know you can't use that.

1202
03:20:11,350 --> 03:20:15,190
Yeah, you can't use that. It's too intense for me.

1203
03:20:20,809 --> 03:20:32,940
Well, your character looks really cool. You ready? I guess we have. I don't have any potions.

1204
03:20:32,940 --> 03:20:37,340
We need them. Are you just going to know? I do have them because they're in my piggy bank

1205
03:20:37,340 --> 03:20:46,040
and it uses my potions from a piggy bank. I'm remembering. All right. So we're going to we're

1206
03:20:46,040 --> 03:20:49,559
going to go for it. You're going to kill everything in a second. No, it's still a

1207
03:20:49,559 --> 03:21:04,649
really hard boss. Oh, all right. But what are you writing? I thought that was a unicorn.

1208
03:21:04,649 --> 03:21:09,690
Is it a you? Oh, I'm a brony. I'm going to tell you that. Oh,

1209
03:21:21,739 --> 03:21:25,420
I'm ready. I'm going to get I'm going to get in sticky. I swear it's going to happen.

1210
03:21:26,139 --> 03:21:32,459
All right. Show off. Show off. Show off. Show off. Show off. Show off. I mean, I can't hold on.

1211
03:21:36,579 --> 03:21:41,420
Oh, this is hard. The game's hard. I knew it was going to happen.

1212
03:21:52,469 --> 03:21:58,100
Only seems to happen on this boss because it goes to the edge of the screen and you like follow it.

1213
03:21:58,100 --> 03:22:04,340
Remember when you said that this was hard? It is phase one. Well, you just killed that without even

1214
03:22:04,979 --> 03:22:28,840
I think slowing down a little. No, I'm good. I'm kind of waiting for the next health bar to go down.

1215
03:22:28,840 --> 03:22:51,350
OK, next part. All right. Here comes the destroyer of worlds, the eater of the gods.

1216
03:22:53,110 --> 03:23:17,979
Oh, that's all right. I'll just be tails. Now you're definitely lagging bad.

1217
03:23:17,979 --> 03:23:22,299
Yep. That it's it's when all these homing projectiles start going off at once,

1218
03:23:22,299 --> 03:23:24,379
it slows the game down and makes it easier to dodge.

1219
03:23:26,360 --> 03:23:29,479
It's helping a lot. Holy shit. There's so many arrows.

1220
03:23:38,600 --> 03:23:42,200
Also, you can see the arrows staying inside of them because there's like a hit delay on the boss.

1221
03:23:42,920 --> 03:23:45,239
So not all the arrows can hit him at the same time.

1222
03:23:48,760 --> 03:24:10,729
That's so stupid. OK, is this part? Well, it's easy to dodge when it's like slow mo, right?

1223
03:24:10,729 --> 03:24:14,250
No, I don't have slow mo, though. You don't know. That's just you.

1224
03:24:15,690 --> 03:24:34,360
I got a fucking beast of a computer. I'm going to die.

1225
03:24:34,360 --> 03:24:35,879
I'm not going to get to see the end of the movie.

1226
03:24:41,620 --> 03:24:46,340
Jerma has left. What? What do you mean have left?

1227
03:24:46,340 --> 03:24:48,899
I think I deced you. Oh, no.

1228
03:24:54,520 --> 03:24:57,639
I was going to see it. I was going to get to see the end.

1229
03:24:58,600 --> 03:25:03,159
Damn it. Are you still in there? Yeah.

1230
03:25:06,520 --> 03:25:11,159
Is it dead? It's like it's frozen.

1231
03:25:11,879 --> 03:25:16,010
Is it killable? I don't think so.

1232
03:25:20,379 --> 03:25:21,659
It crashed. Yeah.

1233
03:25:22,620 --> 03:25:26,469
Where is it? Where is it?

1234
03:25:27,190 --> 03:25:31,030
You press M and open up the map. You can see it.

1235
03:25:31,670 --> 03:25:35,100
This is not crashed. Its head's running around.

1236
03:25:37,340 --> 03:25:40,540
Well, kill its head. This is my chance.

1237
03:25:41,340 --> 03:25:43,260
I'll use the other bow.

1238
03:26:01,100 --> 03:26:04,860
Where is its head? Zoom your map out. You can see it moving around.

1239
03:26:05,579 --> 03:26:10,180
Oh, it's over there. It's dead.

1240
03:26:10,260 --> 03:26:12,780
Did it. Did it.

1241
03:26:12,780 --> 03:26:15,799
Where did it die? Right here.

1242
03:26:16,520 --> 03:26:17,719
Oh, and that sword's really good.

1243
03:26:22,649 --> 03:26:23,930
The power of the gods.

1244
03:26:26,059 --> 03:26:27,100
Excelsis.

1245
03:26:28,840 --> 03:26:33,399
I'll confirm to Jerma beat a Terraria except for the other bosses.

1246
03:26:36,250 --> 03:26:44,260
Whoa. I haven't been this happy.

1247
03:26:45,159 --> 03:26:47,479
Oh, yeah. And you can boost your melee damage a lot.

1248
03:26:47,479 --> 03:26:50,200
And that weapon is super good. All right. I'll keep it.

1249
03:26:51,079 --> 03:26:58,700
I have to have an asterisk because Star had to go on his big, cool character.

1250
03:26:59,420 --> 03:27:01,579
Wow. I just wanted to see what happened when you died.

1251
03:27:02,459 --> 03:27:06,100
Let's go over to the jungle real fast.

1252
03:27:06,100 --> 03:27:10,739
I beat the moon. Moon skeleton. I was there for that.

1253
03:27:11,540 --> 03:27:16,389
All right. Where are you? You're just flying around here.

1254
03:27:16,389 --> 03:27:18,870
Where are you? Going to the jungle.

1255
03:27:18,870 --> 03:27:20,870
Actually, the teleporter just takes it. I'm going to do that.

1256
03:27:21,829 --> 03:27:27,020
Jerma has joined the red party.

1257
03:27:27,100 --> 03:27:28,860
Does the jungle teleporter?

1258
03:27:32,579 --> 03:27:37,110
It's on my roof. Here, I need to.

1259
03:27:44,059 --> 03:27:46,459
Hey, I want to show you something real quick.

1260
03:27:46,459 --> 03:27:48,459
Show me something else cool.

1261
03:28:00,940 --> 03:28:01,819
That was kind of cool.

1262
03:28:06,760 --> 03:28:08,520
You can always teleport back to me.

1263
03:28:08,520 --> 03:28:14,280
I will. I won't yet.

1264
03:28:24,819 --> 03:28:31,770
Jungle dragon Yaron. He's killing me in one hit.

1265
03:28:32,489 --> 03:28:33,129
He does that.

1266
03:28:36,309 --> 03:28:38,229
One hit. You're up.

1267
03:28:38,870 --> 03:28:41,670
We need actual platforms in the jungle if I'm going to do it.

1268
03:28:50,280 --> 03:28:53,799
Are you just flexing right now? Are you just trying to beat this hard boss?

1269
03:28:58,620 --> 03:29:00,459
What else are we going to do? What do you want to do?

1270
03:29:00,459 --> 03:29:05,020
I'm just curious. I'm all right if you want to do a big mirror flex.

1271
03:29:14,409 --> 03:29:17,209
Ask Star to make a drill containment unit for me to play with.

1272
03:29:20,020 --> 03:29:22,870
I forget how to do that.

1273
03:29:23,909 --> 03:29:28,100
What was that?

1274
03:29:29,299 --> 03:29:33,059
I feel like that would be the Christmas present where you give the kid the present.

1275
03:29:33,059 --> 03:29:36,180
He's like, oh, this is so cool. And he plays with it for like a day

1276
03:29:36,180 --> 03:29:39,459
or like 10 minutes. And then you never see him play with it again.

1277
03:29:40,659 --> 03:29:43,860
Like, wow, you went through all this work and you made him the drill containment unit.

1278
03:29:43,860 --> 03:29:46,549
And that's all right, though.

1279
03:29:46,549 --> 03:29:48,549
Yeah. And do you have an axe?

1280
03:29:49,350 --> 03:29:50,309
Oh, a pickaxe.

1281
03:29:50,309 --> 03:29:55,899
Hold on. Oh, everyone's dead.

1282
03:29:55,899 --> 03:30:04,899
That's why I remember when like cutting down trees.

1283
03:30:06,500 --> 03:30:08,819
I do remember when cutting down trees.

1284
03:30:11,059 --> 03:30:12,819
You help make a platform.

1285
03:30:13,860 --> 03:30:15,899
We need a flat little.

1286
03:30:17,979 --> 03:30:22,860
My my friend, I have not carried around platforms in probably two streams.

1287
03:30:22,860 --> 03:30:25,819
Well, yeah. What can you like mine some stuff, daddy?

1288
03:30:30,040 --> 03:30:30,280
Sure.

1289
03:30:40,940 --> 03:30:42,620
All right. What do you need? You want platforms?

1290
03:30:42,620 --> 03:30:44,540
I got platforms like dirt.

1291
03:30:44,540 --> 03:30:46,459
And I just need like a flat surface.

1292
03:30:47,100 --> 03:30:52,790
So when there's a dragon making giant firewalls and you land like in a puddle,

1293
03:30:52,790 --> 03:30:53,829
you don't instantly die.

1294
03:30:55,030 --> 03:31:17,610
This guy can reach you.

1295
03:31:18,500 --> 03:31:18,899
What?

1296
03:31:18,899 --> 03:31:20,100
This looks like it would be you.

1297
03:31:20,899 --> 03:31:22,260
What would what would be me?

1298
03:31:22,260 --> 03:31:24,020
I don't know. Like a guy was walking over here.

1299
03:31:25,139 --> 03:31:26,739
I'm not a guy and I'm not walking over there.

1300
03:31:26,739 --> 03:31:28,659
I'm the guy on the my little pony.

1301
03:31:28,659 --> 03:31:42,139
I hate these things.

1302
03:31:42,860 --> 03:31:48,520
All right. So how much do you need?

1303
03:31:48,520 --> 03:31:49,319
How much space do you need?

1304
03:31:51,770 --> 03:31:52,969
Oh, this is probably good enough.

1305
03:31:52,969 --> 03:31:53,450
Is that all right?

1306
03:31:54,409 --> 03:31:56,840
Are you Brad?

1307
03:31:57,479 --> 03:32:01,209
No, I'm not Brad.

1308
03:32:01,209 --> 03:32:05,819
No, that's okay.

1309
03:32:05,819 --> 03:32:06,940
Three, two, one.

1310
03:32:08,309 --> 03:32:09,270
Three, two, one.

1311
03:32:10,389 --> 03:32:19,530
I wasn't ready.

1312
03:32:20,250 --> 03:32:21,450
God damn it, man.

1313
03:32:21,450 --> 03:32:24,409
I swear this fucking click out of the screen.

1314
03:32:24,409 --> 03:32:24,969
Bullshit.

1315
03:32:27,459 --> 03:32:29,379
Get on my nerves just a little.

1316
03:32:30,899 --> 03:32:32,500
I need to go into full screen mode.

1317
03:32:33,459 --> 03:32:37,909
Dude, I don't even know.

1318
03:32:37,909 --> 03:32:40,219
I'm just going to sit here.

1319
03:32:41,819 --> 03:32:44,040
I'm just going to watch your stream.

1320
03:32:44,840 --> 03:32:47,500
I don't even know where you guys are.

1321
03:32:48,379 --> 03:32:51,420
You're throwing swords at them.

1322
03:32:53,420 --> 03:32:55,659
You're doing all the work and I'm just like, I'm happy too.

1323
03:32:55,659 --> 03:32:58,540
I was lagging because last time I was doing this, it wasn't.

1324
03:32:59,819 --> 03:33:15,829
We also don't have a party.

1325
03:33:15,829 --> 03:33:16,950
So like, I don't even know where you are.

1326
03:33:32,739 --> 03:33:33,379
Damn it.

1327
03:33:33,379 --> 03:33:34,180
Oh, he just went.

1328
03:33:34,180 --> 03:33:35,540
He just killed us both in one go.

1329
03:33:36,739 --> 03:33:38,020
He just went through you and through me.

1330
03:33:39,299 --> 03:33:40,579
Laggy dash phase.

1331
03:33:41,620 --> 03:33:44,020
That was a laggy dash phase for sure.

1332
03:33:47,860 --> 03:33:49,139
He's such an annoying boss.

1333
03:33:49,700 --> 03:34:00,420
So where is he on the scale of Terraria bosses?

1334
03:34:03,219 --> 03:34:05,459
There's one harder than him, I guess,

1335
03:34:05,459 --> 03:34:07,379
which was Supreme Kalamitas after that.

1336
03:34:08,659 --> 03:34:11,719
Can we see it?

1337
03:34:15,450 --> 03:34:16,969
I never made the summon item for it.

1338
03:34:17,770 --> 03:34:34,729
Oh, and the item is also annoying to me.

1339
03:34:34,729 --> 03:34:35,610
That's why I made it.

1340
03:34:36,250 --> 03:34:37,610
Yeah, I don't feel like it.

1341
03:34:37,610 --> 03:34:39,049
Well, I'll just look at a screenshot of him.

1342
03:34:39,049 --> 03:34:40,649
Oh, and you need Yaren's soul fragments.

1343
03:34:41,690 --> 03:34:44,170
It is Supreme Kalamitas.

1344
03:34:45,049 --> 03:34:52,389
Supreme Kalamitas.

1345
03:34:53,030 --> 03:34:58,700
Okay.

1346
03:34:59,579 --> 03:35:01,020
That's it right there.

1347
03:35:01,020 --> 03:35:01,420
All right.

1348
03:35:01,420 --> 03:35:04,299
Is Terraria stealing other people's content live on stream right now?

1349
03:35:04,299 --> 03:35:04,860
What?

1350
03:35:04,860 --> 03:35:07,020
I'm looking at an image of...

1351
03:35:07,020 --> 03:35:08,459
I want to see what it looks like.

1352
03:35:08,459 --> 03:35:09,500
You know what I need to do.

1353
03:35:09,500 --> 03:35:10,540
What are you talking about?

1354
03:35:10,540 --> 03:35:12,620
I'm looking at like an image of the boss.

1355
03:35:12,620 --> 03:35:15,579
This bow won't lag because it doesn't home anymore.

1356
03:35:16,540 --> 03:35:22,709
So are you going for this again?

1357
03:35:25,799 --> 03:35:27,639
You got like a bone to pick here, huh?

1358
03:35:28,280 --> 03:35:46,579
Also, I'm not sure how much harder I'm making this on myself for being on a pony

1359
03:35:46,579 --> 03:35:49,780
and not having a dash for when he turns into instant kill dash phase.

1360
03:36:01,719 --> 03:36:03,719
Is it a certain health that he gets to that he doesn't?

1361
03:36:14,629 --> 03:36:23,459
I like the part where he goes...

1362
03:36:23,459 --> 03:36:28,340
...and he like teleports back and forth while he moves forward.

1363
03:36:28,979 --> 03:36:30,739
Those are my favorite parts about this boss.

1364
03:36:31,540 --> 03:36:35,780
I'm holding a piece of fucking wood.

1365
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:45,639
We're not sure if he's trying to go forward or backwards.

1366
03:36:45,639 --> 03:36:46,280
I love that.

1367
03:36:46,280 --> 03:36:49,079
I fucking clicked out of the goddamn window again.

1368
03:36:49,079 --> 03:36:50,440
Why do I keep doing this to myself?

1369
03:36:52,200 --> 03:36:57,700
All right.

1370
03:36:57,700 --> 03:36:58,180
Here we go.

1371
03:37:10,899 --> 03:37:11,379
Did he get you?

1372
03:37:12,739 --> 03:37:16,899
Yeah, I don't have like a Crimson whatever chaos.

1373
03:37:16,899 --> 03:37:18,899
I can't remember the name of the rod that teleports you.

1374
03:37:20,260 --> 03:37:20,899
German muted?

1375
03:37:20,899 --> 03:37:21,379
Yeah, of course.

1376
03:37:22,840 --> 03:37:24,120
Uh, I accidentally did.

1377
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:28,040
Yeah, and I tried it when we and Ashley are playing.

1378
03:37:28,040 --> 03:37:32,360
If you kill the slime god on expert, he gives you the stupid potions

1379
03:37:32,360 --> 03:37:37,319
that like actually make you immune for six seconds that we just swore off using.

1380
03:37:39,319 --> 03:37:40,040
Rod of Discord.

1381
03:37:40,040 --> 03:37:42,840
Yeah, there's something in Calamity that Rod of Discord upgrades into

1382
03:37:42,840 --> 03:37:44,440
that is better for teleporting.

1383
03:37:44,440 --> 03:37:45,239
I can't remember what it is.

1384
03:37:47,639 --> 03:37:48,840
The Rod of Discord.

1385
03:37:50,040 --> 03:37:52,100
That's cool.

1386
03:37:55,110 --> 03:37:59,510
Oh, do I have the thingy?

1387
03:38:02,469 --> 03:38:04,389
Is that what we call Terraria?

1388
03:38:04,389 --> 03:38:08,149
We got to seal all the stuff except for the last final boss, but that's all right.

1389
03:38:09,110 --> 03:38:17,209
Well, actually also you kill that boss, you get him to 10% health and then he runs away

1390
03:38:17,209 --> 03:38:19,450
and then you have to better chase him down.

1391
03:38:20,250 --> 03:38:25,209
No, no, like he actually leaves at 10% and then he's like, haha, you'll never beat me later.

1392
03:38:25,209 --> 03:38:27,450
And you do it again later and he's different ish.

1393
03:38:27,450 --> 03:38:28,010
Oh shit.

1394
03:38:29,450 --> 03:38:31,770
So technically there's two more bosses.

1395
03:38:31,770 --> 03:38:35,530
Yeah, and then after you beat that, you restart the whole game and play it on Revengeance.

1396
03:38:38,329 --> 03:38:46,170
Which actually, I hope it didn't like delete an item.

1397
03:38:51,829 --> 03:38:58,459
Well, I was absolutely thrilled to follow along and enjoy Terraria.

1398
03:39:03,610 --> 03:39:05,209
Did they already beat Moon Lord?

1399
03:39:06,409 --> 03:39:06,649
Yeah.

1400
03:39:07,450 --> 03:39:16,780
Yeah, well, that's it.

1401
03:39:16,780 --> 03:39:18,219
I don't know if you have anything else planned for today.

1402
03:39:18,219 --> 03:39:23,180
I didn't even expect to stream that long and yet here we were four hours ish.

1403
03:39:23,180 --> 03:39:23,979
Yeah, no, that's good.

1404
03:39:25,100 --> 03:39:26,459
I'll probably just hang out for a little bit.

1405
03:39:27,420 --> 03:39:27,739
Okay.

1406
03:39:27,739 --> 03:39:32,219
Maybe I'll do some random stuff for like an hour or so.

1407
03:39:32,219 --> 03:39:35,180
But yeah, you ready?

1408
03:39:35,180 --> 03:39:35,979
You want to do the outro?

1409
03:39:38,819 --> 03:39:41,219
Hey everybody, it's me OnlyUseMeBlade.

1410
03:39:41,219 --> 03:39:43,299
Check me out on OnlyUseMeBlade on YouTube

1411
03:39:45,620 --> 03:39:47,860
and fake hair everywhere.

1412
03:39:51,940 --> 03:39:58,469
Well, I would say to follow me, which is Jerma.

1413
03:39:59,190 --> 03:40:00,309
Oh, follow Jerma.

1414
03:40:03,100 --> 03:40:03,659
Okay, bye.

1415
03:40:05,989 --> 03:40:10,629
Follow Star too because he streams and that's it.

1416
03:40:10,629 --> 03:40:11,110
It's Terraria.

1417
03:40:11,110 --> 03:40:15,739
Thanks for watching Terraria, Star.

1418
03:40:16,459 --> 03:40:16,940
He's gone.

1419
03:40:16,940 --> 03:40:20,540
I was going to say, Terraria is Saturdays.

1420
03:40:21,639 --> 03:40:22,440
What do we do?

1421
03:40:23,399 --> 03:40:24,440
There's no other video games.

1422
03:40:25,399 --> 03:40:25,879
Never mind.

1423
03:40:26,680 --> 03:40:27,159
I forgot.

1424
03:40:27,159 --> 03:40:29,239
There's like no other video games to play.

1425
03:40:36,459 --> 03:40:38,299
I'm just imagining that guy as his Twitch streamer.

1426
03:40:38,860 --> 03:40:40,780
Well, okay, guys, I did it.

1427
03:40:40,780 --> 03:40:46,459
It's 2028 and there's no more video games.

1428
03:40:46,459 --> 03:40:47,020
I did them all.

1429
03:40:47,819 --> 03:40:48,540
Thanks for watching.

1430
03:40:49,100 --> 03:40:52,569
We did every console.

1431
03:40:52,569 --> 03:40:53,850
I've played every PC game.

1432
03:40:54,649 --> 03:40:56,920
I'll see you when the next game releases.

1433
03:40:58,180 --> 03:40:59,780
Hopefully one comes out on Tuesday.

1434
03:41:08,659 --> 03:41:09,379
Family Feud.

1435
03:41:12,059 --> 03:41:16,540
Yeah, you know, I could load up the Xbox Family Feud.

1436
03:41:16,540 --> 03:41:17,340
Not Kinect though.

1437
03:41:18,979 --> 03:41:20,180
All right, I'm going to give you guys a choice.

1438
03:41:20,899 --> 03:41:22,100
It's going to be up to you.

1439
03:41:23,610 --> 03:41:27,530
Either just Xbox, just Family Feud, no Kinect.

1440
03:41:27,530 --> 03:41:29,690
Just play it and hang out for like an hour or two.

1441
03:41:30,569 --> 03:41:39,270
Or, or we can do Talk to Transformer or Tier Lists

1442
03:41:40,149 --> 03:41:40,950
while we just hang out.

1443
03:41:43,510 --> 03:41:46,469
Those of you that are just out of here

1444
03:41:46,469 --> 03:41:47,510
or you're like, all right, that was it.

1445
03:41:47,510 --> 03:41:48,149
I'll see you later.

1446
03:41:48,709 --> 03:41:53,559
The next stream will be on Tuesday.

1447
03:41:55,370 --> 03:41:57,370
So I'll be off for a couple days here.

1448
03:41:58,010 --> 03:41:59,219
I'll be live on Tuesday.

1449
03:42:06,459 --> 03:42:09,260
But let me get a poll in the chat and I'm going to go P.

1450
03:42:10,059 --> 03:42:12,020
Come back and see what you guys want to do.

1451
03:42:12,020 --> 03:42:12,420
Let's see.

1452
03:42:17,239 --> 03:42:19,479
Talk to Transformer Tier Lists or we'll do Family Feud.

1453
03:42:24,100 --> 03:42:25,059
Again, thanks to Star.

1454
03:42:25,059 --> 03:42:28,899
That was glad that he got to show me all those things.

1455
03:42:30,139 --> 03:42:31,579
Terraria is a really, really fun game.

1456
03:42:32,819 --> 03:42:34,340
Got a little overwhelmed throughout it,

1457
03:42:34,340 --> 03:42:35,540
but that happens.

1458
03:42:35,540 --> 03:42:36,819
It's a lot of info to take in.

1459
03:42:37,459 --> 03:42:38,260
But no, it's cool.

1460
03:42:38,899 --> 03:42:39,700
I enjoyed it.

1461
03:42:39,700 --> 03:42:42,420
Otherwise, why would I have wanted to stream it all the way through?

1462
03:42:45,290 --> 03:42:45,930
8.6.

1463
03:42:47,159 --> 03:42:47,479
All right.

1464
03:42:50,649 --> 03:42:51,209
Strawpoll.

1465
03:42:52,969 --> 03:43:05,540
Talk to Transformer Family Feud, Xbox or Tier Lists.

1466
03:43:06,180 --> 03:43:08,069
I'll be right back.

1467
03:43:09,899 --> 03:43:10,219
Vote.

1468
03:43:13,670 --> 03:43:15,190
And I will see you guys in a minute.
