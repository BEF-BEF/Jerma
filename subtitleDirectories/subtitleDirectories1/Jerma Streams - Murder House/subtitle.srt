1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,949
I'm just trying to be very quiet so I don't scare anybody. Hi.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:36,539
Oh, hold on. Very cool. That nice relaxing music is about to be replaced with some scary shit.

3
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,859
So this is a game that I'm actually scared to play because I feel like it's going to be

4
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:53,990
insanely loud. So let me ask you this. I have to ask you. Should I turn this down to 1%?

5
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:22,180
No. So is this one, is this going to like blow up my ears? No. I'm so scared. You have no idea.

6
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:30,810
This game is way too dank. Whatever. Okay, let's do this. I'll do it right here for now.

7
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:43,370
It's a puppet combo. Turn it all the way down. Turn the filter off. 20, door turns brightness.

8
00:01:48,629 --> 00:02:09,750
What the fuck? Which one should I put on? 16 millimeter is cool. That is kind of cool.

9
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:26,969
16 millimeter, PSX, CRT. None, none, none. Scan lines one. Just normal, please. This hurts my eyes.

10
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:42,840
Let me do PSX and turn this off. Let me see how that looks. New game. Let's try that. Prologue

11
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,400
Murder House. I mean, I feel like we're going to have to play the prologue. That looks fine.

12
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,759
That's not my mic. Don't people are going to be complaining about that. That's not me.

13
00:02:54,759 --> 00:03:29,719
Get my green tea. Okay, kid. You're next. How do I move? Come on, kid. Get your ass up there.

14
00:03:29,719 --> 00:04:00,620
That's not my mic. Oh, kid. Say cheese. Cheese. Easter. Turn the volume down. Yeah, the volume's

15
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:19,769
way down. I must have fallen asleep. Just turn it down. How do I move? Oh, I thought it was first

16
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:28,300
person. Okay, that's weird. All right, hold on. Why is there no sound? I'm so paranoid about the

17
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:43,639
audio. I don't think this is supposed to be audio right now. Mom, is the mall closed? No, I can hear

18
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:56,759
it. Just low. It's going to be loud. Yeah, I know. Just be, just be ready for it. It's going to be

19
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:05,899
horrible. It's going to be terrible. Just be ready for it. Oh, you can do Dolly in FPS. Which one should

20
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:26,490
you prefer? FPS or the kind of old Resident Evil style? FPS. FPS. FPS. Oh, man. That sensitivity's

21
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:41,740
got to go up, though. Way higher. Rumble off. Invert Y off. What are you talking about? Auto-aim off.

22
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:55,750
Okay, let's see. That feels better. Dolly, please. Change the game and the title. Oh, shit. Good idea.

23
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:04,540
Oh, it is Murder House. It's correct. Zoomers are picking FPS. I'll switch between them. How

24
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:18,699
does that sound? It's meant to be played in Dolly. Okay, well, I'll go back. I'll play some with Dolly

25
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:31,660
and one without. What am I supposed to do? It's closed. Do a poll? You know, that's not a bad idea.

26
00:06:31,660 --> 00:07:02,759
All right. Mods run a poll. Do you want FPS or Dolly? Which one? It's closed. What do you think? Okay.

27
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:11,189
So I'm supposed to just leave the mall? How do I get out of here? It's a landslide for,

28
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:27,300
for what? I can't get out this way. Okay. You know what's crazy? 77% say Dolly. What the fuck?

29
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:42,060
Zoomers BTFO. Is it really that much? Dolly's what? I mean, that's, that's unanimous. I can't,

30
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:50,779
I have to go back. 77%. All right, let's go back. I think I want to use the controller because this

31
00:07:50,779 --> 00:08:02,300
is weird to do with keyboard and mouse. The tank controls don't work. I can crawl under it. How do

32
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:27,560
you crawl? C, control. I need the control plugged in for this shit. This is, I can't do it. Oh,

33
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,159
that's much better. Okay. That's a little too sensitive though. That's far too sensitive.

34
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:49,220
Looks good. Don't quit. There we go. All right. Now I'm happy. Enable rumble on the controller.

35
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,279
I don't do that. I think rumble is the dumbest thing that's ever been invented. I truly believe

36
00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:02,659
it. I think rumble is just dumb. I just really do. I'm sorry. I just, I, it just like shakes

37
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:08,549
your hands. See back like 20 years ago, they created rumble because they wanted it to be

38
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:13,429
more immersive. Like, and as you can see, when you jump over the ledge and there's like somebody

39
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:19,740
shooting, it's, oh, I can feel it. That it's like 20 years ago, right? It was, that was cool. But

40
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:31,110
like, I don't, I don't need that anymore. I'm sorry. I just don't need it to me. Now it's just like,

41
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,309
I don't. Okay. Stop, stop, stop. Every time you get hit,

42
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,100
no, I don't, I just want to play the game. I'm sorry. This might be weird. I'm a complainer.

43
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:59,659
That's fine. The Easter bunny's chair. I guess he went home for the night. I don't know if you guys

44
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:19,639
can hear this, but it's making scary sounds. I fucking hate tank controls more than anything.

45
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:26,789
Tank controls are just the cinematic mode in every car game. I feel like I'm playing GTA.

46
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:49,350
It's just on foot cinematic mode. I can't leave now. Where am I supposed to go? It's closed.

47
00:10:49,350 --> 00:11:34,649
Omega Lo, no audio. It's there. It's there. Fix your stream. What are you talking about?

48
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:42,039
Audio is actually kind of low. Turn it up. It's puppet combo, man. I feel like you're going to

49
00:11:42,039 --> 00:12:01,980
regret this very shortly. Warning, actual warning, loud audio warning for real. Where the fuck am I

50
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:33,690
supposed to be going? What is happening? I can't get out this way. Where do I go? This is the

51
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:53,590
beginning of the game. Fuck. I went all the way to the back. This kid's going to be out of breath,

52
00:12:53,590 --> 00:13:04,059
but I get lost in malls. It doesn't matter how many times I've been to a mall. I could go to the same

53
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:11,509
mall a thousand times. And if you say, Hey dude, can you tell me where the, you know, can you tell

54
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:19,580
me where the Macy's is? I'd go. I don't fucking have any idea. I could go to the same mall a

55
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:28,179
thousand times. And I still could not tell you because it's just like, it's just lines with

56
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:35,240
stores. And then I have to sit there and go, what? I don't know. I don't remember. It's always so

57
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,059
embarrassing because especially if you, let's say for instance, if, Oh, you've got a local mall. Oh,

58
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:45,379
let's go explore the local mall. That sounds like fun. Oh, you know, I'd really love to go.

59
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:51,929
I'd really love to go to Auntie Anne's Pretzels. Yeah, I would too. That sounds like fun. Oh,

60
00:13:51,929 --> 00:14:02,169
okay. Let's go. Auntie Anne's Pretzels walking distance. Where is it? It's in here somewhere.

61
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:48,070
Okay. I think it's this store over here. I hate it. Who is he talking to? Where the fuck am I

62
00:14:48,070 --> 00:15:32,019
supposed to go? I can't get through here. Another security gate. This one's locked. shiny. Take the

63
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:38,470
key. Yes. You took the key. I can use the inventory by pressing Z key. What is that on the controller?

64
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:54,340
Okay. That looks like Tim Heidecker. Okay. A key. I can't use that key here. Do I have to go all the

65
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:39,129
way back? Get this camera in the right place. Am I going the right way? Am I going the right way?

66
00:16:39,210 --> 00:17:53,180
Oh, I got it. This is going to be some Slenderman bullshit. Resident Sleeper. There's got to be a

67
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:06,390
way out. The exit's right there. All right. It's going to be like... Should I lower the volume?

68
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:32,950
I'm going to lightly put this in. I warn you. These are lightly in my ears right now. What does

69
00:18:32,950 --> 00:19:03,299
that say? Locked. Locked. All these are locked. This one's opened. Why is it doing like a... Should

70
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:09,559
I hide? Yes. This is a good hiding place. I could peek out with the action button and get a closer

71
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:33,799
look with the look button. Okay. So I can hide here. All right. Let me out. There's no shitting

72
00:19:33,799 --> 00:20:04,039
mechanic. Why would there be a shitting mechanic? Okay. All right. I got to go into the bathroom.

73
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:36,259
Where's that bathroom? Where's the bathroom? Farting and screaming. Quick, quick. Hide, hide, hide.

74
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:46,460
He locked the door? What do you mean he locked the door? Dude, what are you talking about? No way.

75
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:53,910
He's going to kill me right here. I got to go now. Got to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, got to go,

76
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,710
got to go, got to go, got to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, got it.

77
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:53,400
Where is he? Didn't he go in that stall? He's in that stall right now. This shit's locked. What do

78
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:39,579
I do? There's a keypad. I don't know the code. Will you take the flashlight? Yes. I got the

79
00:22:39,579 --> 00:23:08,819
flashlight. How do I use it? Okay. It's equipped. How do I turn the fucking flashlight on? What is

80
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:35,420
that? Okay. Screwdriver. Is there a TV here? Can't be the fuck out of here. I don't like this. I don't

81
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:44,839
like this at all. I really don't. I unlocked it. What's in here? I don't like this. It's too

82
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:54,180
nerve wracking. I don't like it. Okay. I have a screwdriver. What do I do with the screwdriver?

83
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:27,019
I thought I could get it. So what do I take the screwdriver? Broken vending machine. Fix it.

84
00:24:27,019 --> 00:25:02,309
I don't know what the fuck to do. This is back in the bathroom. Shit. It moved. Do I need the

85
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:22,410
screwdriver for something else? Literally omega low. This dude's gone. What do you mean I'm gone?

86
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:45,740
I'm fine. The bathroom is huge. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Lockers. Come on. Really? Just some

87
00:25:45,740 --> 00:26:01,480
lockers. That's it? I can't pry one of these open. Oh, you're full of shit. Come on. I was already in

88
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:14,759
here. I remember one of the lockers you can open. It was kind of weird. You mean like right here?

89
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:29,690
This one has blood on it. You missed the shower. The answer is within this room. Hey, thanks. Where

90
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:47,539
am I going though? Shower? There's a shower in the locker. You know, I played Resident Evil 1 when

91
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:54,279
I first came out and I got to like the first part where you had to like walk around and find the one

92
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:21,640
place to go. I just stopped playing it. There's something below the drain. Oh, there's a key.

93
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:30,259
What door do I need to open this with? There's a tiny key. It says 1024. 1024? Is that the...

94
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:57,190
Okay. I don't remember where to go. 1024? In their door? That's... Where's that door? Right here.

95
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:19,269
Oh, fuck off. What door is locked? 1024. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not this place. 1024.

96
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:46,359
In here? Or a locker? No, they don't number the stalls. What am I talking about? It's definitely

97
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:55,690
a locker. Where are the lockers? I'm lost in them all. It's a stall like 1024, 1025, 1026.

98
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:06,420
I need a map. I don't remember where the lockers are. I have no object permanence.

99
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,950
If you told me to draw a map of Dust Bowl and TF2, I have a thousand hours on that map. I still...

100
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:22,819
I wouldn't be able to draw it for you. I really wouldn't be able to. I got it. All right. 1024.

101
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:32,470
How am I supposed to know which one of these is 1024? None of these are numbered. Oh, wait.

102
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:56,569
This one is 1024. Hey. SS34. 5534. That's a number. All right. Get out. 5534. This motherfucker's

103
00:29:56,569 --> 00:30:26,970
going to be right here. Huh? Where am I going? Where's that door? 5534. A toaster. Frigerator.

104
00:30:26,970 --> 00:31:00,279
It would be rude to take someone's lunch. They're not in there, right? Is that the Jacksepticeye?

105
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:42,380
That's so funny. It's too quiet. Janitor Jack. The voices are too quiet. What if Janitor Jack is...

106
00:31:42,380 --> 00:32:01,460
Hold on. I can't turn the dialogue up. Look out the window. Janitor Jack, I think, is in trouble

107
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:17,670
here. Well, Janitor Jack is probably the Easter Bunny. The Easter Bunny's going to walk in here

108
00:32:17,670 --> 00:33:28,410
and be walking slowly towards me. It's going to be Janitor Jack. Of course it's Janitor Jack.

109
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:41,740
I was making a muted joke and it caught me. I was making a, I have no audio joke. Murderhouse.

110
00:33:41,740 --> 00:34:09,289
It was definitely Janitor Jack. Oh, pancakes. No, that's not it. That was the prologue. Tutorial

111
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:24,619
complete and Jacksepticeye as Janitor Jack. Turn the volume up. Ever since the Nun game,

112
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:46,619
I'm terrified to turn any of these puppet combo games over 10% audio level. Ever. Did you miss

113
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:57,429
the jump scare? You did. The Nun game is literally the loudest shit ever created. Nothing can even

114
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:07,719
compare. All right, so now where are we? The lights are already off. I can't turn them off

115
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:19,260
anymore. Present day, 1988. This is the murder house and it's for sale. People died in this house.

116
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:52,280
Fuck. I have to move? Like we're here. This place? You left you have this after the incident with

117
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,610
the poodle. That could have happened to anyone. These are all just Sims 1 characters. All right,

118
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:30,579
let's get started. We don't have all day. Who? Megalo? He's dead. Make yourself useful and find

119
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:39,940
a survey in. That reminds me, somebody made a video of me testing cigars that I saw. It was

120
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,550
really funny. Anybody got that video? I want to show that video on stream. It's fucking hilarious.

121
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,820
Somebody took the eating the tearless stuff and they they made it as if I was testing cigars.

122
00:36:54,579 --> 00:37:03,690
It's so stupid. Does anybody have a link to the video? The actual like video video because like

123
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:16,570
pulling it up reddit up is a pain in the ass. He saw it. Oh yeah. Oh, let me get it. Yeah,

124
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:26,539
long lost Gerald985 cigar tear list from the 20s. Let me get it. I love this video. It's just so

125
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:53,780
dumb. We're going to watch this first. Let's see if I can get it full screened here. Okay,

126
00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:06,980
is it audio on here? Yeah, this is so fucking stupid. I love it. All right, you ready?

127
00:38:06,980 --> 00:39:23,579
It's so stupid. Look at all these cigars. Oh Jesus. Okay, let's go. It tastes like marshmallows.

128
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:43,559
Wait, my stamina will drain. I have to pick a break. Hold on. Here's this loud game. Too many

129
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:49,269
cigars. All right, so do I get to choose who I play with or no? Oh, that's a cool little feature.

130
00:39:49,269 --> 00:40:00,090
Tracking. All right, so we're here doing a story. This is this person's car, right?

131
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:17,880
You look terrifying right now. Why? All right, here's the news van. So I just gotta get in the

132
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:37,380
house. This is really creepy. Locked. Windows really dirty. I can't see inside. Can I break in

133
00:40:37,380 --> 00:41:13,780
here? Oh, the side. The flashlight under your face. We've already done this before. It's an old

134
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:26,920
routine. I look green. Why am I green? I'm green and now I can't see. I actually can't see. Turn

135
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,760
the ring light on. It's all right. It's on right now. That's why you can see my face. I just can't.

136
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:43,219
I literally can't see. Can I grab it through here? Looks like a gun. I can't reach from here. Okay,

137
00:41:43,219 --> 00:42:00,150
are we going to hear a distant scream? We're going to hear like, oh my God, I'm going to go

138
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:15,579
investigate. Somebody saw a rodent. I'm a writer too. There's a fellow writer. I, I can't, where am

139
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:29,909
I? Why is the camera doing this? Name one book you've read. Sure. Dance of Dragons from a song

140
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:43,820
of ice and fire. Book five, 10 years ago. Well, I don't know how to get in there, so I don't think

141
00:42:43,820 --> 00:43:07,059
I can. Have you ever read the Bible? Um, I think parts of it. Name one book you've read. I don't

142
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:21,239
know. I don't, why do I need to prove that I've read a book? It's creepy in here. So I was going

143
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:32,119
to open the front door. I don't even have a flashlight. This is stupid. This is dumb what

144
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:55,239
I'm doing. I need a flashlight. Can I have gotten a flashlight somewhere that I didn't see? What?

145
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:10,440
Empty cabinet. This will make a great hiding spot. Okay. Where do I get a flashlight? It's a big

146
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:28,659
basin sink. I don't know where to go. A dryer. It's, I thought it said seasoned. Washing machine.

147
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:35,929
Okay. Oh, fuse box. An average fuse box. Wait, I think a fuse is missing. Okay, I need to get a fuse.

148
00:44:35,929 --> 00:44:54,650
Can I open the door? You've unlocked the door. All right, so everyone can come on in, right?

149
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:11,590
Oh, there we go. Okay, so come on in. I found a way in. Do they, do I have to go tell them? Or should

150
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:18,980
I just keep exploring? Empty cabinet. Make a great hiding spot. Yep. A greasy fridge. There's no way

151
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:51,429
I'm going to open that. Kitchen cabinet. Search it. Yes. Kojima fell off. I don't think Kojima made

152
00:45:51,429 --> 00:46:08,699
this. What's that? Hole in the floor. I see something shiny at the bottom. I can't reach it.

153
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:23,750
I don't have any items. How about, how about I don't have no items? No items? None. I can't open it.

154
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:40,940
The doorknob is missing. No items. This is no items. Finally. No. There's enough items. Pencil.

155
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:53,320
What the fuck am I going to do with a pencil? Can I pick the lock with the pencil? What's this?

156
00:46:53,320 --> 00:47:00,360
Stack of boxes. No, no, no. This. Left a note. Hey, it's Jerry, the real estate agent. Looks like

157
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,920
someone broke the lock on the basement window and got in the house since the last time I was over

158
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:11,030
here. They stole the goddamn fuse so the power is out. Don't worry. I know there's another fuse

159
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:14,869
around here somewhere. I'd let the front door open in case I don't hear you guys drive up.

160
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:36,710
Just shout at me when you get inside. Okay, well where's the fuse? An old dusty mug. I don't want

161
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:50,570
to go back down in the basement. Spider on your face. All right, I'm just going to go talk to them

162
00:47:50,570 --> 00:48:09,059
because the door's open now. I'm going to say, hey, I got a back door. All right, come on in.

163
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:39,480
Stupid. Idiots. Idiots. Idiots. Oh, come on. Did I not open? Whatever. Just idiots. I have to unlock

164
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:48,760
the front door. Yeah, but I don't know. This is not my house. I don't know where anything is.

165
00:48:48,760 --> 00:49:05,429
So straight ahead should be the front door. Straight ahead. There we go. Go through here.

166
00:49:05,429 --> 00:49:13,739
I can't go through there. I don't have a doorknob. Do you know where anything in your house is?

167
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:25,590
Oh, there's an upstairs. There's an upstairs. This is the front door right here, but how the

168
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:33,380
fu- I couldn't even see it. There's an upstairs, Lois. Fucking goddamn family guy.

169
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:47,639
Yeah, you should have. You still can. That's a huge ass microphone, by the way.

170
00:49:53,579 --> 00:50:09,539
Grab all the equipment in the van. Let's set it up. All right, what do we got here?

171
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:24,380
Microphones, lav mics, shotgun mics, C stands, cameras, HD camera, maybe a GoPro to put

172
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:52,630
somewhere. He won't finish this in three hours. Shut up. All right, I gotta go to the other one.

173
00:50:52,630 --> 00:51:01,210
Do I have to unpack it? He won't finish this. What if I don't finish it? Who gives a shit?

174
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:16,789
What do you care if I finish this game or not? What do you care? What do you care? Clean the

175
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:35,659
camera. No, it's dirty. Why is he so toxic now? I just am, okay? When are you gonna do a comb stream?

176
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:45,699
I don't think there's ever gonna be a comb stream ever again. All right, the lights are up, but

177
00:51:45,699 --> 00:52:03,940
there's no power in this house. I need a fuse, right? Fuse. All right, can you stop smoking?

178
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:18,579
Turn it back on. I don't know how. Figure something out. He's a real piece of shit, isn't he?

179
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:30,739
23k Andy doesn't care about his chat anymore. That's not true. Do I have a- oh, that's- I

180
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:43,320
thought that was a cigar. 23k Andy. Holy shit, there are 23- 24,000 people here. Hope you're

181
00:52:43,320 --> 00:53:03,380
having a good night, good day. Apparently getting scared. Scary games tonight. I guess that's locked.

182
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:10,599
What's with all this bullshit? I'm telling you right now, I could probably elbow drop through

183
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:14,460
this and break it and get what's in there. This doesn't look that sturdy. I could just run across

184
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:20,980
the room and just slide and tackle and kick this and break it. If I needed to get in there, I could

185
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:41,900
literally jump from the bed and just stomp down and land on it and break it. Locked. Okay, there's

186
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:51,239
two locked things up here. Covered table. A lot of these hiding spots. I'm imagining this is important

187
00:53:51,239 --> 00:54:05,940
later. Not right now. This is the locked room. Okay, okay, I have to remember where this is.

188
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:11,780
That's the dark room at the end of the hall. So keep that in mind. Write that down. Dark room end

189
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:23,880
of the hall has two, three locked things over here. What about this? Hey, that guy that took a four

190
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:47,210
month break after dancing. Oh, I can't move this. I need someone up here to move it. Oh, a fuse. Nice.

191
00:54:47,210 --> 00:55:08,199
Okay, check everything. This is a weird bed. Covered table. Another pencil. What are the pencils for?

192
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:19,480
Let me guess. It's a save point. I need to use a pencil to save the game. Stupid fucking god. What

193
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:25,829
was that? Stupid fucking god damn fucking idiot. Stupid fucking game. Fucking stupid fucking piece

194
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:41,900
of shit game. What is that? Solid iron. No way I can open this. Maybe there's somebody there.

195
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:55,059
All right, well I have the fuse. Let's go back down. All right, can somebody help me move the

196
00:55:55,059 --> 00:56:09,539
thing up there? Later, somebody will help me. Let's go down to the basement again. Locked.

197
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:18,780
Flimsy lock. You're a sellout. What did I do? I didn't even do anything. What are you talking

198
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:42,840
about? All right, where's the fuse box? This guy buys porn. All right, screw it in. Power's back

199
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:56,139
and the washing machine is on. The door is jammed shut. Should I have a pencil on there? Okay, well,

200
00:56:56,139 --> 00:57:20,679
whatever. I got the power back on. So now what? All right, we're gonna have to do interviews and

201
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:31,239
stuff. All right, good. Everything's set, Tom. Lighting's ready. The cameras roll. Hey Gary,

202
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:39,019
I was thinking we could- I don't pay you to think, Dana. I pay you to read the goddamn script.

203
00:57:39,019 --> 00:57:51,739
I hate this job. Well, pull it together. Ready, everyone? What are we doing here? All right,

204
00:57:51,739 --> 00:58:01,369
action. Anthony Smith, more commonly known as the Easter Ripper. What's her boom mic

205
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:08,730
and a handheld mic? The mere mention of his name sends shivers up the spines of parents across

206
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:16,519
the country. His horrible murder spree leaving lives shattered and families ripped apart. Tonight

207
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:22,840
we'll go inside his vacant home where 11 innocent children spent their final moments in agonizing

208
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:29,159
pain and terror. What the fuck? Untouched since those horrible crimes eight years ago,

209
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:36,789
some say his spirit still haunts the home till this day. I'm Dana Turner and this is a News

210
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:45,349
Nine special report. Silenced tears inside the home of serial killer Anthony Smith.

211
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:50,420
Cut. Let's take a break. Gary, I think I want to redo the line where-

212
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:56,260
This isn't 60 minutes, Dana. It's channel fucking nine. We're out here to win a Pulitzer.

213
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:03,059
So why are we even here? We could have done this whole thing from outside the house. If we're not

214
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:07,860
trying to be thorough and have a really deep investigation on this, just do it in front of

215
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:15,340
the house and then leave. I'm going to find a place in this gross house to fix my makeup.

216
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:21,940
Right? I think I heard that. Wait, did she say I'm going to go fix up my gross makeup?

217
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:33,050
What did I just hear? I wasn't paying attention. I don't know. What did she say? Gross house.

218
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:46,710
I need to go fix my gross makeup. Okay. So I think why would we stay here? Is it Pulitzer

219
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:59,670
or Pulitzer? I don't know, dude. You and I ain't ever going to get one, so it doesn't matter.

220
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:22,949
What if they will get it? Speak for yourself. Speak for yourself. Too bad the house doesn't

221
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:39,320
have cable. Should I go to bed? I'm sorry, but if you expect to win a Pulitzer prize, I mean,

222
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:47,349
you got to just do what you're doing. You don't just say, I'm going to win a Pulitzer prize

223
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:52,900
soon. You got to work and get it and work for it. You don't just say I'm going to be a Pulitzer

224
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,420
prize winner. I mean, I said that like five years ago when I thought that my stream was going to

225
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:03,960
really take off and become like this really important thing. What is the Pulitzer prize even

226
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:13,300
for? I don't even know. Is the Pulitzer prize science? What is the Pulitzer prize? What is it

227
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:30,579
for? It's journalism. Oh, why did I think it was science? What's the science one? The Nobel prize

228
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:50,809
is science. Okay. So what do I do? Nobel prize is for whatever. Nobel could be pretty much for

229
01:01:50,809 --> 01:02:04,389
anything, right? There are lots of different categories. Can I go to bed? I want to find a

230
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:14,809
way back into that, whatever it is, a greenhouse or something back there, whatever it is. Go get the

231
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:27,639
gun. I need a key or something to get in there. What about down here? The cool one is science

232
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:58,539
though. These are all locked. I need a key somewhere. This game is a real talkie by the way.

233
01:02:58,539 --> 01:03:48,920
Where do I go? A mannequin. Should I try to get into the greenhouse? Help. Whoa. Can you fetch me

234
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:55,800
a glass of water? You want a glass of water from here? I think I'm going to say it. I'd probably

235
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:01,210
drink my piss before I drank out of this sink. I would drink a glass of my own piss before I

236
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:20,789
drank out of the sink here. All right. I need to get a glass of water. That's Vera Lunatic. What?

237
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:34,760
Okay. Where do I get a glass to cover it or anything? I need a glass. Why is he always

238
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:44,730
talking about drinking piss? Literally said it once in like a year. Fine. I will concede that you

239
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:50,869
find me one point in the last year that I said I was going to drink my own piss and I will concede.

240
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:09,260
I've said I've did it maybe once in a year. It was literally two weeks ago. No, it wasn't.

241
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:38,460
Here's your water. I have no idea where I'm going. I need to deliver the water. The voice

242
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:47,699
actors is in chat right now. Oh shit. Really? Dana's VA and you're playing you playing this

243
01:05:47,699 --> 01:06:18,420
made my night. Good luck. Look, holy shit. That's cool. Wait, did you bash this? Oh, we got to keep

244
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:27,110
Dana in the chat. That's cool. And maybe we can get hired on our real network. All right. So I

245
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:36,139
got a key. There's a lot of member of the doors. I got a key now. People to sleep here with this

246
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:44,420
boring story. Time to sex this up. Hey, you. Me? Yeah, you put this sheet on. Gary, what the fuck

247
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:49,380
are you doing? No one's going to want to watch this boring thing. And your dry reporting isn't

248
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:58,170
helping. I'm reading the teleprompter. People want to see ghosts. So we're going to fake a ghost

249
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:03,849
sighting. Okay, intern, when Dana says he still haunts the home he grew up in, I want you to run

250
01:07:03,849 --> 01:07:12,809
through the background. Got it? All right. Let's do this. Okay. After Dana says he still haunts the

251
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:18,809
home he grew up in, I need to run through the door. Action. The rampage started in late March

252
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:25,449
1979, when Smith walked into a local mall and took a seasonal position as an Easter bunny.

253
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:30,650
A job meant to spread joy and cheer put him in the perfect position to abduct young children

254
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:38,230
until his capture and execution in 1985. Many of the bodies have not been recovered. As told

255
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:43,670
by the sole survivor, Randy Martinez, Smith would release the children in his greenhouse

256
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:49,190
and force them to go on a deadly Easter egg hunt while he stalked and murdered them. What the

257
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:57,480
fuck? Two years later, many say he still haunts the home he grew up in. God damn it. I said one

258
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:10,059
time not to stand in the shot. I couldn't. Oh, because A is. A job meant to spread joy and

259
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:21,140
cheer put him in the perfect. Relax. A job meant to spread joy and cheer put him in the perfect

260
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:28,569
position to abduct young children until his capture and execution in 1985. Many of the bodies

261
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:34,090
have not been recovered. As told by the sole survivor, Randy Martinez, I don't know how to

262
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:38,970
release the children in his greenhouse. I thought I had to skip the dialogue on a deadly Easter egg

263
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:44,810
hunt while he stalked and murdered them. I'm not in the shot right now. Many say he still haunts

264
01:08:44,810 --> 01:09:00,970
the home he grew up in. God damn it. What? I fucking just ran by. I just ran by. Run through

265
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:06,569
the door. A job meant to spread joy and cheer put him in the perfect position to abduct young

266
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:12,569
children until his capture and execution in 1985. That's not even in the shot. Many of the bodies

267
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:17,449
have not been recovered. That's not in the shot. As told by the sole survivor, Randy Martinez,

268
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:23,529
Smith would release the children in his greenhouse and force them to go on a deadly Easter egg hunt

269
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:30,010
while he stalked and murdered them. Two years later, many say he still haunts the home he grew

270
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:37,399
up in. What was that? Tom, did you get that? I apologized to the viewers at home, but I just

271
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:43,239
felt an energy pass by behind me. Let's continue deeper into the house and see what secrets we

272
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:49,819
uncover. Cut! This is ratings gold. Let's take a break and pick up in the bedroom. Great timing.

273
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:54,699
I'm going to go use the restroom. Hey you, I'm getting hungry. Take the van and go pick us up

274
01:09:54,699 --> 01:10:07,140
some pizzas. Use the station credit, Todd. Okay. Reddit gold. All right, let's go get some pizzas.

275
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:26,789
I'll go get some pizzas. Let's just go with the front door. Fuck it. What's your favorite pizza

276
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:33,050
place? What's your favorite pizza place to get a pizza? What is it? A chain. What's your favorite

277
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:48,489
chain pizza place? Little Caesars? Domino's? No. I'm sorry, that's wrong. Did you find anything

278
01:10:48,489 --> 01:10:53,609
juicy yet? Not yet, but I think I'm onto something. I think there's something hidden here that nobody

279
01:10:53,609 --> 01:11:00,250
knows about. Good work. Domino's? Come on. Don't mention this to anybody, especially Gary. He'll

280
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:06,680
steal any story for us. What the fuck? Domino's is good. I don't know. Is it though? I feel like

281
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:14,659
it's not. I know what a Domino's pizza tastes like, and it's not, I don't think, I don't,

282
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:25,829
I don't remember it being good. Should I do this first? Just to have items?

283
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:35,579
No. The sauce is really busting. You drink piss. Why would anyone care about your opinions in this?

284
01:11:35,579 --> 01:11:48,539
Um, you name one time when I drank piss. I can't open this? What the hell is this key even for?

285
01:11:48,539 --> 01:12:07,159
Really? Really? What's taking so long? I can't function on an empty stomach. Sorry, I'm going

286
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:13,000
to go soon. Soon? Make it pronto. You know, I have not had Little Caesars in a very long time. I feel

287
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:22,229
like I'd probably like it. I bet you I would really like Little Caesars. Aren't Little Caesars

288
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:42,390
pizzas like three dollars? Aren't they really, really cheap? Five. It's five dollars for a pizza

289
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:50,649
at Little Caesars. Five dollars. I'm sorry, but you cannot do better than that. Five bucks for a

290
01:12:50,649 --> 01:13:05,739
pizza? We're talking five dollars for a full pizza? I feel safe in this room, like nothing bad can

291
01:13:05,739 --> 01:13:21,300
happen here. Save the game. Okay, so game saved. Are you sure you want this? You'll need to use

292
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:37,140
another pencil to save again. Yeah, okay. Flashlight. Hell yeah. Cigar? Oh, it's a pencil.

293
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:56,500
Hold on. This is a lot. Let me read this. Little Caesars parent company owns the distribution

294
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:01,779
center that sends ingredients to all the pizza chains so they don't have to pay for their

295
01:14:01,779 --> 01:14:15,829
ingredients like Domino's, Papa John's, or Pizza Hut. For real? Really? I mean Pizza Hut. Oh man,

296
01:14:15,829 --> 01:14:28,010
oh man. Oh man, oh man. I get fucking worked up when I start thinking about Pizza Hut.

297
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:36,180
Large stuffed crust pepperoni pizza with a side of eight buffalo tenders in the mild sauce with

298
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:48,710
some blue cheese. Oh man, oh man. That's nothing better. It's so fucking good. Everybody can say,

299
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:55,979
oh my god, that's gross dude. Oh no, it's not. You're just not, you just don't get it. You know

300
01:14:55,979 --> 01:15:01,100
what I mean? You just don't get it. If you don't like the stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut

301
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:06,619
pepperoni and it's just right out of the oven, you just don't get it to me. To me, you and I,

302
01:15:06,619 --> 01:15:12,539
we're just never going to get along with the buffalo tenders and they're nice and hot and

303
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:23,800
ready and they get the blue cheese on them. What was I doing? I'm playing a game. You just don't

304
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,859
get it. You just don't get it. That cheese that they put, wait, I actually need to go down here.

305
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:36,100
The cheese that they put in the crust at Pizza Hut is a magical cheese that does, I don't know

306
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:45,289
where they get it. I don't know what it is. It's magic. It tastes just so delicious. I don't even

307
01:15:45,289 --> 01:15:58,180
know what it is. Looking at the mod chat, my Pizza Hut went out of business and I tried it once. It

308
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:08,039
was terrible. No, you just don't get it. You don't get it. No, you don't get it. You don't get it.

309
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:17,720
Okay, I can actually see. What about your thoughts on Costco pizza? I actually don't think I've really

310
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:25,479
ever had Costco pizza before. Not that I can really reliably remember. I hear it's pretty good though.

311
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:46,140
Okay, I can actually see what's over here. Bridge, place to hide. This is going to make me throw up.

312
01:16:46,140 --> 01:17:11,020
Empty cabinet and puke. Whoa! Shut up. I wasn't even that big of a deal. This is gonna hurt my

313
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:17,460
back. My shoulder hurts now because of that. I just, I actually hurt my shoulder. I just pulled a

314
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:39,939
muscle in my shoulder. Oh, let's open this. What is that? A doorknob. Ooh. Okay, let's open up that

315
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:59,319
door that needs a doorknob upstairs. You're old, dude. It's getting dark. Yeah, I know I'm old.

316
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:22,789
I'm older. Okay, so what's in here? Is that a fire poker? Pretty good weapon. Oh, hell yeah.

317
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:47,220
There's weapons? How do I swing? It's unlocked. Oh wait, there's something over here. Old fireplace

318
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:56,699
sealed up. Two-handing a fire poker. Yeah, it's dangerous. Yeah, I love Pizza Hut's awesome. It's

319
01:18:56,699 --> 01:19:20,500
really good. Oh, this is unlocked now. All right. Well, I gotta go get pizza. Are they even open?

320
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:38,859
The van. Who would do this? There's a note pinned on the windshield. No where to go now. Looks like

321
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:43,899
we'll be playing a game. You'll be hunting eggs. I'll be hunting you. Find them all and you can

322
01:19:43,899 --> 01:20:29,800
leave. Don't find them and you can't. Find all the eggs. Should I go try to get the gun? Looks

323
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:46,680
like a gun. I can't reach it. Yes, I can. Really? Why do I look so scared? Because it's a scary game.

324
01:20:46,680 --> 01:21:22,119
I don't see any eggs. Stop being YouTube Andy. What are you on about? Can't reach it? I have a

325
01:21:22,119 --> 01:22:02,729
fire poker. How can I not reach that? Where should I go? I'm gonna go upstairs, I think. I'm going

326
01:22:02,729 --> 01:22:22,649
upstairs. Where's the safe room? Where are the pizzas? There's something going on here. The van

327
01:22:22,649 --> 01:22:27,560
has been wrecked and the gate is locked. Where's Tom? I don't know. He's dead. I can't find him

328
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:33,960
either. Must be the goddamn real estate agent. I told you to get another 50 bucks when we were

329
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:42,819
done. Come out you chicken shit. Damn it, Gary. It's dark and this place is scary and gross.

330
01:22:42,819 --> 01:22:49,850
Can we finish this? Still holding the mic. Fine. I don't know where the hell Tom is so you're gonna

331
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:56,539
have to hold the camera. I don't know how to work this. It's easy. Just hold it steady. That's about

332
01:22:56,539 --> 01:23:05,579
it. Okay, action. This is Dana Turner on location. How do I zoom in? I've just been informed that we're

333
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:11,659
stuck here. Someone has wrecked our van and we can't get our fucking pizza lunch promised by my

334
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:18,699
producer. Is Anthony Smith executed in the electric chair in 1985 back from the dead

335
01:23:18,699 --> 01:23:24,539
and back for revenge on anyone who enters his house? Find out soon if we don't get the fuck

336
01:23:24,539 --> 01:23:31,479
out of here. That would actually be kind of crazy. I can't work under these conditions. Isn't it like

337
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:47,930
10 o'clock at night? Hey intern girl, see if you can find where the hell Tom is. Okay, gotta find Tom.

338
01:23:47,930 --> 01:24:01,210
I'd be pissed too if I didn't get my pizza. Especially if it was a fucking Pizza Hut stuffed

339
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:19,060
crust pizza with a side above a loving her wings. I would be also very annoyed by that. You need to

340
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:39,859
shut the fuck up. You need to not care if I like Pizza Hut or not. There's nothing in here, right?

341
01:24:39,859 --> 01:24:58,710
Shut the fuck up, Jeremy. There's nothing else here. Fuck Pizza Hut. I'm serious. I feel like a

342
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:13,189
lot of you guys probably haven't had it in a long time. When was the last time you had Pizza Hut?

343
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:18,579
Solid iron key you're gonna need. All right. Well, I don't know where this guy is.

344
01:25:18,579 --> 01:25:30,899
2011, 1997. That's what I mean. I feel like you're not being fair to the Pizza Hut. Let's stop that.

345
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:47,350
Where is this guy? That doesn't count. Like you cannot say I had it in 1992 or something.

346
01:25:48,069 --> 01:25:55,960
No, even like the air was tasted differently in like the early 90s. Like everything smelled

347
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:07,239
different. You know what I mean? Like everything was different. I already picked that up, but

348
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:19,829
where is this guy? Probably down. I remember the 90s had a smell. It was, I can't even describe it.

349
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,560
My everybody's car had a 90s smell. The air just kind of had this, it just smelled like,

350
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:53,399
it smelled like the 90s. It's everything had a different smell. What was that? Cabinets locked.

351
01:26:54,199 --> 01:27:07,130
Tom? Tom, I didn't think I would find you. This is getting weird. Do you think the Easter Ripper

352
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:12,390
is back? It looks like we're stuck here. All the doors are locked. Let's get a key blade. We're

353
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:20,979
fine. I found a key, but I can't figure out what it opens. Let me see. You take it. Maybe you can

354
01:27:20,979 --> 01:27:26,710
find the door. I'm going to go look for another way out. I'll catch you later. Okay. So there's

355
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:45,500
a lot. This looks like an iron key. That's definitely through the upstairs door.

356
01:27:46,220 --> 01:28:06,329
Can I get the fuck out of here? Oh my God. I'm walking in circles, dude. Why did I stop? I don't

357
01:28:06,329 --> 01:28:27,130
know. Dude, I'm wicked fucking high. Okay. You all right? Do weapons have durability? This is

358
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:40,659
definitely the key to upstairs. There's no way it's not. Why is she holding this like a lightsaber?

359
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:57,380
Only a master of evil, Doth. That's how, that's how Obi-Wan holds his lightsaber. Watch out.

360
01:29:05,619 --> 01:29:22,260
Only a master of evil, Doth. He's right here. I thought I was downstairs. Get back here. We good?

361
01:29:22,260 --> 01:30:03,590
No, I want to pick up the microphone. You need to save the game. Where do I do that? How do I

362
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:09,739
save the game? Where do I save it? Oh, there's an Easter egg shoved in her mouth. Take the egg.

363
01:30:09,739 --> 01:30:51,560
I took the death egg. It's under the stairs. Oh my God. So now I'm going to go upstairs and I'm

364
01:30:51,560 --> 01:31:26,779
going to open the big door. There it is. Circuit breaker or something. I don't think I need to use

365
01:31:26,779 --> 01:31:48,149
this. Bed frame. Dresser. Ooh, what's that? Letter opener. What can I do with that? A letter opener.

366
01:31:48,149 --> 01:32:07,880
What did I need? Did I need to use that somewhere? Broken refrigerator. It's a table. I don't think

367
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:26,550
there's anything else in here. Got the letter opener. A normal light. That's weird. Why would

368
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:33,319
you say a normal light? Letter opener though. It's pretty sharp. I need to find something to

369
01:32:33,319 --> 01:33:25,739
use this on. Shit. Shit. Letter opener. What do I use the letter opener on? Use it on a letter.

370
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:51,689
Can I get it? Can I pick it up? Do this or something? What is down here? So I'm going to

371
01:33:51,689 --> 01:34:02,680
lift the letter. Open it with a letter opener. Where do I go? Back to the basement? Maybe Tom

372
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:27,989
would be down there. I think Tom's probably going to be down here. Is Tom still here? Tom? I can

373
01:34:27,989 --> 01:35:39,779
hide in there. Where is he? Shit. I heard a bunch of bullshit over here. Letter opener. That works.

374
01:35:39,779 --> 01:35:49,260
I can actually pry it open. Magnet. I can get the gun. What the? There are hairs in my mouth. I can

375
01:35:49,260 --> 01:36:33,189
get the gun with the magnet. God, he's going to be right here. What's that mean? It means he's

376
01:36:33,189 --> 01:37:06,659
coming. It means he's coming. Upstairs? There's a locked door up there. No. Major stream of reactions

377
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:29,380
coming up here. Really? Just go in here for a second so I can breathe. Where is there more

378
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:48,890
locked doors? There's one down the hall here. I think that's it. There's a locked door down the

379
01:37:48,890 --> 01:38:17,460
hall. There it is. A note. The big bunny watches us. Its big black eye follows me when I move.

380
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:21,699
It always watches. At night we hear noises coming from the walls. The first time I heard them,

381
01:38:21,699 --> 01:38:27,960
I got happy because I thought it was you and mommy shouting for me, coming to save me, but it wasn't.

382
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:33,899
When the shouting starts, the others cover their ears, but I try and listen. I put my head against

383
01:38:33,899 --> 01:38:38,460
the wall and hold my breath, but no matter how hard I try, I can't understand what they're saying.

384
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:44,819
They shout and cry a lot. It isn't mommy and it isn't you, but it sounds like adults and they

385
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:54,149
sound sad. Really sad. Did the Easter Bunny take them? Dana is dead. I thought that was a bunny.

386
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:59,239
Help me find an exit. Uh oh. Oh no.

387
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:34,810
Black light? Just a stupid black light. What am I going to do with this?

388
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:13,479
Oh, that's... I'm far back, aren't I? This video game is a genuine first generation copy

389
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:18,520
produced on behalf of and with the approval of... What is that?

390
01:40:28,779 --> 01:40:44,250
Oh, that's just the intro. Fuck. All right. Oh shit. Where was I on this? I got the...

391
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:55,189
Oh fuck. All right, where was I? I don't remember. I gotta get the magnet from downstairs,

392
01:40:57,829 --> 01:41:05,770
magnet from down in the basement, come up, get that, go upstairs, right? What do I mean? No,

393
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:12,279
fuck. I need the letter opener. Where's the letter opener? Letter opener is up. Oh,

394
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:29,109
letter opener. I need more pencils. All right. At least I know where he comes in.

395
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:34,899
That's not the wrong save, but I went down. We're going to watch Gary. Yeah. Okay,

396
01:41:34,899 --> 01:41:40,420
letter opener, down to get the magnet, up. All right. I need to save the game again.

397
01:41:41,060 --> 01:42:08,420
Okay, let's go. This is the right save. Okay, down, basement, letter opener, thing,

398
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:24,819
get the magnet, magnetize, save the game, and then whatever. Where's the fucking basement?

399
01:42:24,819 --> 01:42:39,539
What game is this? This is Murder House. It's a house where people get murdered and you have to

400
01:42:39,539 --> 01:42:53,260
solve the mystery. Where is it? It's in here, right? I only have three saves total. Should I

401
01:42:53,260 --> 01:43:10,229
not use it? Should I try to get around the bunny and then save it after that? You just have to run.

402
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:21,859
You suck at this. It's a horror game. Come on. All right, so let me get out of here. Go upstairs.

403
01:43:21,859 --> 01:43:32,039
Maybe I should just save it. Who cares? All right. I really don't want to do this again.

404
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:40,010
Your health is too low to fight. Maybe I'll just save it then and go upstairs.

405
01:43:40,010 --> 01:44:06,069
Your health is too low. Do you have any potions or food? I don't think I do. Where do you get

406
01:44:06,069 --> 01:44:15,220
heals? I have the thing that looks like I can heal. Okay, here we go. I'm just going to save

407
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:46,579
it. Whatever. If it's a bad idea, it's a bad idea. What are you guys doing? All right, let's go.

408
01:44:46,579 --> 01:45:05,000
This time, I'm going to try just to run by. Let me scope out some areas here. All right, so what's

409
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:15,479
where's a good hiding spot? I could just probably kill him. Where's there a hiding spot in here?

410
01:45:15,479 --> 01:46:09,029
Is there one? Is that? No. He's gone. What? Oh no, I need to take this. Why is he not here?

411
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:45,399
I'm confused. Why is he not here? Oh, that's back upstairs. Okay, what does that do? Does

412
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:52,699
that reveal anything? Can I hide in something here? No, where can I hide in here? It's very

413
01:46:52,699 --> 01:47:36,659
important. Itchy face. It's a dumbwaiter. A rack of torture devices. Oh, I unlocked it. Okay,

414
01:47:36,659 --> 01:48:37,220
I need to save the game. This is the door right here. I need to save the game. I told you. I knew

415
01:48:37,220 --> 01:49:01,350
I was doing the right thing. Where is he? Why won't he walk over here? Why? Why won't you come over

416
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:27,350
here? I'm trying to lose him. Oh, fuck it. Let's go. Torture devices. Why does it keep doing that?

417
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:49,000
It's not even him. He visited again. No one saw him, but we woke up and there was a big basket of

418
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,720
eggs. I was so hungry. I need to take the wrapping off. We all took big bites, but the blonde girl,

419
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:58,039
when she took her bite, her mouth was covered in blood. She dropped the egg and inside the

420
01:49:58,039 --> 01:50:02,520
chocolate, the Easter bunny had played a trick and put sharp razor blades. There was a lot of blood

421
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:40,470
and she wouldn't stop screaming and the wall started to laugh. Man, faster if you could. My

422
01:50:40,470 --> 01:51:01,739
God. You got to be fucking kidding me, dude. This is fucked up. Long girl's gone. Gracie won't

423
01:51:01,739 --> 01:51:06,220
stop staring at the big bunny on the wall. Randy says the chocolate eggs make us sleepy. Not going

424
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:15,079
to eat tonight. Randy told me to memorize this song. I don't know what he means. 8883-553-1212-10108.

425
01:51:15,079 --> 01:51:27,050
Somebody write that down. Thank God. I just have to get out of here safely and I can save it again.

426
01:51:27,609 --> 01:51:44,739
I'm going to be sick. Oh, okay. I got to get out of here. How do I get out of here? I actually need

427
01:51:44,739 --> 01:52:00,420
to get out of here and go save. What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?

428
01:52:00,979 --> 01:52:09,140
Do I need to take this? Okay. I got to get out of here. Okay. Let's get out. Get out. Give me out.

429
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:13,500
Give me the fuck out of here. Okay. Get me the fuck out. Get me the fuck out of here.

430
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:17,670
Get me the fuck out. Get me the fuck out now. Get me the fuck out. Give me the fuck out. I'm

431
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:26,039
going for the head, by the way. I'm going for the fucking head. I'm going for the fucking head.

432
01:52:26,039 --> 01:52:57,380
I got to get out. I got to save the game. Fight or flight. I'm going for the head. I'm literally

433
01:52:57,380 --> 01:53:01,239
going for the head. I'm going to swing as hard as I can into the person's head. You know what I

434
01:53:01,239 --> 01:53:04,680
mean? Just like I'm going to crow hop twice and go right to the head as hard as I can.

435
01:53:09,819 --> 01:53:24,069
What the fuck? No, don't go into this weird chamber. Oh my God. Oh no. He's going to come

436
01:53:24,069 --> 01:53:28,069
down. He's going to... Did he open the door? Oh my God. Go in the dumb waiter. Go in the dumb

437
01:53:28,069 --> 01:53:41,300
waiter. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Huh? I couldn't go up the dumb waiter. I took it down. I took

438
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:57,300
the thing down. Oh, fuck that. Come on. Oh, shut up. Okay. Well, I know we come through there now.

439
01:53:59,449 --> 01:54:06,899
Please do infomercials instead. Fuck. Now I got to go up and then down and then up and then down

440
01:54:06,899 --> 01:54:14,020
and then left and then up and then down and down and then right and then... Oh, come on. Do I really

441
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:25,369
have to do all this again? No. Wait, where is this saved? Is this not the wrong save? No, it's not

442
01:54:25,369 --> 01:54:39,159
the wrong save. All right. He dies up here and then I got to go down and then... Oh, fuck. I'm just

443
01:54:39,159 --> 01:54:43,029
going to run. I'm going to run. I'm just going to run. I got freaked out that time because I thought

444
01:54:43,029 --> 01:55:02,229
he grabbed me and I thought I was going to get in a death animation. Oh, this is fucked up. I got

445
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:25,609
to go upstairs. How come he's not here? All right. We go upstairs, do the black light, move the thing,

446
01:55:25,609 --> 01:55:33,930
go down, get the... What was it? The rope or something? We go up here, do the black light,

447
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:49,340
move the thing, go down the dumb waiter, get the pencil, get the rope. You need to open the draws.

448
01:55:49,340 --> 01:56:09,399
You already did this part. Yeah, I know. I know. This and then I just got to run. I'm just running.

449
01:56:09,399 --> 01:56:21,109
This dude's accent is really exotic. Exotic. I barely have a Boston accent anymore. Sometimes.

450
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:26,619
What? Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Just get in,

451
01:56:26,619 --> 01:56:38,010
just go in and just pick up the shit off the ground and then leave. Fuck out of the way.

452
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:43,579
What was in? There was something in here. There's a pencil, I think. Right? Yep. Okay. Get the pencil,

453
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:51,319
get the rope and then get out. Please say harbor. Yeah, I know you wanted me to say like harbor,

454
01:56:51,319 --> 01:57:04,630
but I did that. Whatever. Leave. Then I'm just running through and I'm going... What do I need

455
01:57:04,630 --> 01:57:12,010
to go from here? The save room. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Get me out. Out, out, out,

456
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:23,079
out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out. Nothing else. And I was running. Oh, wait,

457
01:57:23,079 --> 01:57:33,220
was something in here? I forget. Was anything in here? No, it's just a note. Maybe I have to

458
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:43,500
have it read. Okay. All right. I fucking hate this. Here we go. You need to drink Coke starlight.

459
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:54,890
All right. So should I just run? I think I'm just going to run. Here we go. Run. Just run straight.

460
01:57:54,890 --> 01:58:24,819
Run. Where the fuck am I going? What did I just do? Where's the up? Where's up? Where's up?

461
01:58:24,819 --> 01:58:37,659
Where's up? Where's up? I need to go up. Where's up? Right here. Get me to the save point right now.

462
01:58:37,659 --> 01:59:11,590
I need to save point. Oh my God. Tom's camera. I'm so stressed. Me too. What does it say? It

463
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:15,510
feels like somebody's holding the door shut. What are you talking about? What are you talking about?

464
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:22,789
I can't go in here. You got to be shitting me. I can't save the fucking game right now. You can't

465
01:59:22,789 --> 01:59:50,140
be serious, right? You can't be serious. What am I supposed to do about this shit? Where am I?

466
01:59:50,140 --> 02:00:10,680
Where's my character? Where's my character? Where's my character? This is the wrong room.

467
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:26,460
Oh my goodness. Are you okay? Gary's dead. What's this? An egg. I got to go to the TV room,

468
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:38,659
which was the room right next to this. Okay. Okay. All right. Give me out. Please don't be here. Oh,

469
02:00:38,659 --> 02:00:49,510
fuck you. Okay. Was it, was there a number over there? Where's the room that has the TV in it?

470
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:57,829
It's this one here. I don't remember which one has the TV in it. I can't save the game. The door

471
02:00:57,829 --> 02:01:07,979
is closed. Save? What do you mean save? The door is shut. Somebody's holding it shut. Oh, thank God.

472
02:01:07,979 --> 02:01:29,670
This is just pure anxiety. Okay. At least I can save it. Now I'm not scared if I die. All right.

473
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:46,359
I got to go watch the TV. It's in the room that I was looking at before. Is it this one here?

474
02:01:46,359 --> 02:02:05,239
What, what room is it? It's not this one. Is it down the hall? I don't remember where it is.

475
02:02:05,239 --> 02:02:20,760
What's your favorite pizza? Stuffed crust from Pizza Hut. It's the best. Is it this one? Okay.

476
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:28,619
Here we go. I need to make sure I can hide somewhere. Can I hide under here? Can I hide in

477
02:02:28,619 --> 02:02:35,420
here? No. I got to find a place where I can hide because I'm going to watch this tape and then this

478
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:43,210
asshole is going to come in this room. I can't, I need two people to move this. Okay. We're gonna,

479
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:49,609
I'm hiding right now because I just heard somebody crying. This motherfucker is probably coming up

480
02:02:49,609 --> 02:03:25,609
here now. You didn't just open the door, right? Okay. Here we go. Let's run with the piano in the,

481
02:03:25,689 --> 02:03:43,369
are you going to hide in the piano? Okay. Oh no, not Tom. Did he, did the killer hide something

482
02:03:43,369 --> 02:03:56,680
in the piano? That piano room is the one with the fireplace. Where is that? I think it's upstairs.

483
02:03:57,239 --> 02:04:14,460
This is the last egg. It's down on the stairs, the red door at the bottom of the stairs.

484
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:25,270
Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. I don't have any saves. I wish I could just

485
02:04:26,069 --> 02:04:55,529
save state right now. I must be in use the piano.

486
02:04:58,869 --> 02:05:31,770
Super Mario eight, eight, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

487
02:05:31,770 --> 02:06:10,649
12, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. That's an old McDonald. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh

488
02:06:10,649 --> 02:06:14,949
God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.

489
02:06:14,949 --> 02:06:32,500
Hide. Hide. Hide. He's an Easter basket. Does it need more eggs than this? Oh fuck. Where do I go

490
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:57,979
from here? What should I do? What should I go? What should I do? What should I do? I'm hiding in

491
02:06:57,979 --> 02:07:50,729
here. Is he here? What's that? Did I get there in enough time? I think I'm good. No, I didn't want

492
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:59,449
to come. I wanted to look at my menu. What do I have for items? I have rope. What if I take this

493
02:07:59,449 --> 02:08:12,619
rope? Can I go outside and get the shotgun? Use the rope to get the shotgun, right? Like, yeah,

494
02:08:12,619 --> 02:08:15,699
I think it's go get the rope with the scope, get the gun with the shirt with the go get the rope

495
02:08:15,699 --> 02:08:34,250
with the shotgun. Help me. Right. Bod watchers sniff. I got to go up to the wardrobe. Can I

496
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:42,100
actually use the rope and pull the thing? Where is that? Oh my God. He's here. That's upstairs

497
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:47,750
in the room with the TV, right? I don't want to fuck around because I don't want to go all the

498
02:08:47,750 --> 02:09:01,739
way back. That's upstairs room with television. I don't remember where that is though. My brain

499
02:09:01,739 --> 02:09:14,619
just can't do it. Where is that fucking wardrobe? It's upstairs somewhere. Something else here?

500
02:09:57,699 --> 02:10:24,069
Gun. Do I have any bullets in this gun? Excuse me. How do I use this? Okay. I have a gun now. Yes.

501
02:10:24,069 --> 02:10:57,960
I can save it. Where am I going? I'm trying to go to move the wardrobe. I don't know where

502
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:20,569
that is, but we're going to go. It's the game is stressing me to fuck out. Save it. Save it

503
02:11:20,569 --> 02:11:38,380
right now. I just don't know where the bunny is going to show up. It took him five minutes to

504
02:11:38,380 --> 02:11:52,699
get here. I know, but I hate not. I hate not being able to save. I'm just doing it. I hate not being

505
02:11:52,699 --> 02:12:36,220
able to save. Cry more. Is it? I think tie the rope around this and pull it down. Um, what the

506
02:12:36,220 --> 02:13:10,039
hell is this bathroom? I'm not opening that yet. Search it. It's cabinet. How can it? Oh, band-aids.

507
02:13:10,039 --> 02:13:19,140
Should I take those now? I'm at warning health sucker. I can recover some health. Am I don't,

508
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:31,380
I'm not going to take it till I'm red, right? I can take one more hit. I think. Okay. That's unlocked

509
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:52,699
toilet. Ooh, pencil. Good. Weird. Okay. All right. I'm going to open the curtain. Here we go. I'm

510
02:13:52,699 --> 02:14:01,859
ready to shoot. Whatever's over here. Wait, unlock this too. Probably right. Yep. The real estate

511
02:14:01,859 --> 02:14:42,329
agent. That's the last egg. The egg room was the piano room, right? I'm not saving it yet.

512
02:14:42,329 --> 02:15:08,970
This didn't take that far to get here. Unlock the exit. You bastard. Now what do I do? Is there

513
02:15:08,970 --> 02:15:18,600
anything I haven't checked? How do you reload the gun? How do I reload the gun? Is that eight or

514
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:45,609
three? How do I reload the gun? I'm saving it. It's a zero out of three. How do I reload? All right.

515
02:15:45,609 --> 02:16:02,390
Third slot zero out of three. How do I use? How do I reload? So where's the exit then? I'm trying

516
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:23,430
to think of a door that didn't open. Is there an exit? Holy shit. I don't know where I'm going.

517
02:16:23,430 --> 02:16:59,829
I just, I think I just walked in this way to go. No, put the fucking gun on, dude. Put the fucking

518
02:16:59,829 --> 02:17:14,379
gun on. Get out of here. How do I get out of here? How do I get out of here? How do I get out of

519
02:17:14,379 --> 02:17:20,620
here? Is he still chasing? Which way do I go? Don't run through the main entrance. That didn't work.

520
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:40,540
It's locked. We're stuck in here. Down into the basement. Okay. How do I get to the basement

521
02:17:40,540 --> 02:18:21,940
from here? Okay. Got done. How do I get out of here? I get the fuck out of here. How do we get

522
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:49,479
out of here through here? It's open. This has bullets, right? This has bullets. It says zero

523
02:18:49,479 --> 02:18:55,829
out of three, but how can I reload it? How do I reload the fucking gun? Zero out of three.

524
02:18:55,829 --> 02:19:05,770
I need to reload the gun. Reload the gun. How do you reload the gun? Three is the max. Oh,

525
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:30,229
fuck. This is bad. Where's the shotgun? Where's the shotgun? It's here somewhere. Where is it?

526
02:19:30,229 --> 02:19:51,020
Where's the shotgun? I'm going to blow this guy to hell. Where is it? Where's the shotgun?

527
02:19:51,020 --> 02:20:06,149
There it is. Right? It has to be. Give me. Give me. Quick. This guy's dead. All right. Now get

528
02:20:06,149 --> 02:20:20,629
me out of here and get me to the car. Where's the exit to the greenhouse? Am I supposed to know who

529
02:20:20,629 --> 02:20:35,299
this is? Tom? That's right. It was quiet. Innocent, Tom. Harmless. Walk all over him, Tom. Mama's boy,

530
02:20:35,299 --> 02:20:50,139
Tom. When I did, I killed them all. Why? To avenge my brother. Anthony wasn't the Easter Ripper.

531
02:20:50,139 --> 02:20:58,739
I was. He turned himself in to save me. I thought I could control the urge to kill,

532
02:20:58,739 --> 02:21:10,809
but it's back. And now I'm going to kill you. Tom. Tom. I have a shotgun in my hands and you're

533
02:21:10,809 --> 02:22:10,870
holding a sickle. You want to do the math there real quick? Oh my God. Don't die. Oh no. Why won't

534
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:15,190
he die? I shot him four or five times with a shotgun. What? He's bulletproof. What the hell

535
02:22:15,190 --> 02:22:29,899
was that? Give me a break. What was that bullshit? All right. So what do I do? Wait, wait, wait.

536
02:22:29,899 --> 02:22:34,200
Where am I right now? I just have to go down to the dumbwaiter. Just go down to the basement.

537
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:40,379
Right? I still have heal. I'm not going to use it. Down to the basement and then out.

538
02:22:40,379 --> 02:22:56,020
Just like I was before. Yeah. Let's get out of here. Just get out. There's all the eggs. Okay.

539
02:22:56,819 --> 02:23:12,540
Out. Have you tried talking it through with them? You can find more ammo. I think I'll be all right.

540
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:34,870
Fucking don't know. I still don't know where the hell I'm going down here. I need to hit him with

541
02:23:34,870 --> 02:23:50,950
the... Okay. Get me out. I need... I have a heal. I'm not going to waste it. If I need to fire poker,

542
02:23:50,950 --> 02:23:58,180
I'll just swing and run. I have a heal. I'm not going to use it yet. I can take one hit from the

543
02:23:58,180 --> 02:24:11,860
sickle. Stop touching your nose. I'm a weirdo, man. I'm going to be touching my face. Give me

544
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:19,030
the shotgun. I can't... No, dude. I wasn't ready to leave. What are you doing? I'm not ready. I was

545
02:24:19,030 --> 02:24:42,780
trying to walk over. Why? God damn it, Tom. Oh my goodness. I'm just getting stuck on everything.

546
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:55,350
Tank controls are the shittiest things ever. Just get the fuck out of my way, Tom. What happened?

547
02:24:58,229 --> 02:25:05,700
Oh my God. Tank controls are the stupidest fucking things on earth.

548
02:25:23,940 --> 02:25:33,780
Just kill me. Fucking please. Just kill me. Oh my God. Tank and... Fucking God. I'm going FPS.

549
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:38,819
I don't give a fuck for this. I'm just going FPS. I'm going to FPS this guy. Hold on. Let me play a

550
02:25:38,819 --> 02:25:52,440
video game. Damn motherfucker. Why is auto aim turned off? I don't know. I'm going fucking FPS.

551
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:59,780
I don't care. You can call skill issue all you want. I ain't... No. I'm sorry. That was weird.

552
02:25:59,780 --> 02:26:13,770
I'm going FPS. And I'm going to auto aim. And I'm going to get rumbled in here. Okay. I don't give

553
02:26:13,770 --> 02:26:29,399
a shit. Let's go. I'm ready. Melania didn't make you this mad. Yeah. Well, Melania also... Melania

554
02:26:29,399 --> 02:26:41,319
also, I don't have to run through half a fucking level to get to... Where's my... There it is. Down

555
02:26:41,319 --> 02:27:27,739
to the basement. You need to start with a summon. I'm fine. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. I'm not using

556
02:27:27,739 --> 02:27:38,629
mouse and... Wait. Should I use mouse and keyboard for this? All right. Mouse and keyboard. What the

557
02:27:38,629 --> 02:27:53,989
fuck? No. It's weird. I don't like it. It's weird. I don't like it. It's weird. Okay. Don't go that

558
02:27:53,989 --> 02:28:00,620
way. Go over here. Give me the shotgun. I'm going to shoot this guy four times and I'm going to beat

559
02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:32,899
the fuck out of him with this wrench or whatever the hell this is. Okay. Come on. Where is he?

560
02:28:32,899 --> 02:29:31,639
That's right. To avenge my brother. Get out of the venue. Swing. I had another round. I did, man.

561
02:29:31,639 --> 02:29:53,799
I had another shotgun shell. It wouldn't shoot. I had another shot. I did. Do the math. God damn

562
02:29:53,799 --> 02:30:11,239
it. Where can I get some more bullets? He's not going to show up, right? If he does, then whatever.

563
02:30:11,239 --> 02:30:27,829
I'm going to get bullets. Somebody sit in the attic. I need bullets. There are draws here for the

564
02:30:27,829 --> 02:30:54,340
letter opener. You shitting me. Where? Where? I don't see any. Where? No. I don't see any. Where?

565
02:30:54,340 --> 02:31:28,170
In the corner and a pencil. That's like a washing machine. Where? Where? You full of shit.

566
02:31:33,180 --> 02:32:01,780
You said in the basement. There's more ammo. The attic in the basement. I thought you said attic,

567
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:18,920
not basement. You said attic. Anywhere else I could look. That was hot. That was a hot slice

568
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:38,760
of pizza. There's nothing in here. Only ammo is in the basement at the end of the hallway.

569
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:49,979
Are you kidding me? Did I already get it though? I feel like I already did it. In the basement.

570
02:32:49,979 --> 02:33:06,549
I already get it. In the basement at the end of the hall. You're full of shit. I found it.

571
02:33:06,549 --> 02:33:21,579
What is that? Oh, this is a big first aid kit. Oh, that's not what I want. Basement at the end

572
02:33:21,579 --> 02:33:38,420
of the hall. Use the bandages. Bandages. Okay. You're telling me there's ammo down here. Is

573
02:33:38,420 --> 02:34:06,340
that what you're saying? You're telling me there's ammo down here. That's what you said to me. What

574
02:34:06,340 --> 02:34:22,120
do you want about? I need help. You need to tell me. I walked by it. No help. No help. No help. No

575
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:33,079
help. We said the attic. It's down in the actual dungeon. Well, I need to go down there anyways.

576
02:34:33,079 --> 02:35:04,280
This one here. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. I just got to go. I got to go. I'm

577
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:08,100
just leaving. I'm just going to go. I don't need to save it. Fuck it. He's right here. All right.

578
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:20,329
I've got pistol. I've got full health pack and I've got everything I need. All right. Pistol,

579
02:35:20,329 --> 02:35:30,059
full health pack and a shotgun coming up. You do the math. We're going to start with the pistol.

580
02:35:30,059 --> 02:35:39,899
It's eight shots and then we're going to move to shotgun to finish it. I have a full health pack.

581
02:35:39,899 --> 02:36:05,780
I should not fuck this up. Okay. Here we go. Bang, bang. I can take that if I need to. I'm ready.

582
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:21,940
Here we go. Eight shots. I'm going to run first of all. I'm going to get across the whole map.

583
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:27,350
What the fuck are you doing?

584
02:36:59,670 --> 02:37:19,260
How many was that? Eight? How many was that? I got one more shot.

585
02:38:01,819 --> 02:39:04,360
What the heck? Did I win? That was too... I don't like games like that. It's just too

586
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:14,420
trust. It's too stressful. It's too stressful. That was pretty, that was pretty crazy.

587
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:37,239
That was too stressful. Well, there you go. The info of that was murder house and then

588
02:39:37,239 --> 02:39:49,159
blood wash. You aged 20 years playing that. Is there a new game plus? I'm going to wait

589
02:39:49,159 --> 02:39:59,079
to see if there's anything after credits. You know what else I was looking over at the mod chat too?

590
02:40:01,959 --> 02:40:08,899
There's those, the dread collection. I haven't done any of those. It's kind of like a jackbox

591
02:40:08,899 --> 02:40:17,239
horror game party pack. I could probably do those at some point. Play Nunn Massacre. I already did

592
02:40:17,239 --> 02:40:28,899
and I kind of said I'm never coming back to it. Yeah, there's five of them or something, right?

593
02:40:32,149 --> 02:40:42,219
Dodge caravan sliding door dot wave by CGFX. Unlock and lock a door with key.

594
02:40:43,180 --> 02:40:56,709
Page turn. Draw slam two. When did I play Nunn Massacre? I think that was when I did all the

595
02:40:56,709 --> 02:41:12,280
Itch.io games, right? Yeah, I think we could probably call... Maybe I'll play... Vampire

596
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:17,479
Survivors got an update, right? Somebody's saying that. Maybe I'll play a round of that.

597
02:41:17,479 --> 02:41:25,180
Wind down with some Vampire Survivors and then call it. That sounds good. What do they add?

598
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:48,940
It's a hell of an update. Really? There's a... We're still in the credits. You should play Stay

599
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:57,659
Out of the House. If you have... I said a few weeks ago that if you have a one to three hour long

600
02:41:57,659 --> 02:42:01,340
horror experience that you want me to play, throw it in the recommended in the discord

601
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:15,719
because I feel like I missed all these. It's a long credit sequence. It really is. System Shock?

602
02:42:15,719 --> 02:42:29,379
Ah, maybe not. Yeah, play Stay Out of the House. Okay. Do you even read that channel? I'd say once

603
02:42:29,379 --> 02:42:34,659
every week or two, probably once every two or three weeks, I will just open discord solely to

604
02:42:34,659 --> 02:42:41,610
look at the recommended channel. Tons of stuff I pulled over the last year from there. I go,

605
02:42:41,610 --> 02:42:48,920
oh, okay, that seems pretty cool. So I check it all the time. I really do. I might not be that

606
02:42:48,920 --> 02:42:53,559
active on discord, but I check that channel a lot whenever, you know, every few weeks.

607
02:42:54,120 --> 02:43:08,709
I kind of just scroll back. What about the comments on the second Jerma videos? I will tell you I

608
02:43:08,709 --> 02:43:15,459
don't think I've read a YouTube comment, goodness, in probably five years. It's been a long time.

609
02:43:20,379 --> 02:43:34,889
I don't think I've read a YouTube comment in five years. Go read them now. Holy shit, did 500 people

610
02:43:34,889 --> 02:43:49,930
work on this? This is crazy. There's a lot of people. I think it was good. I love this old PS1

611
02:43:50,489 --> 02:44:04,790
aesthetic. I'm glad it came back. Did you play Soma? Yeah, one day. This is, oh, it's Patreon.

612
02:44:04,790 --> 02:44:11,319
Okay. For a second, I thought we were still in, okay, all right, it's Patreon. Okay. I was like,

613
02:44:11,319 --> 02:44:21,459
holy shit, a lot of people worked on this. Didn't you say that you hated it like three weeks ago?

614
02:44:22,549 --> 02:44:39,590
Soma? What do you mean? I said I hated Soma? Go reply to a YouTube comment from 2020.

615
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:50,780
I don't think so. I want to see if there's anything at the end here. I'm very curious.

616
02:44:53,139 --> 02:45:03,180
New squirrel stapler. What about Bloodborne PSX? I don't think I'll ever play it. That's really cool.

617
02:45:04,579 --> 02:45:13,989
But I played so much Bloodborne that I feel like I wouldn't like it. I feel like I would play that

618
02:45:14,709 --> 02:45:23,049
and be, I just want to play the regular Bloodborne. It's really short. How is it short? Is it the whole

619
02:45:23,049 --> 02:45:37,690
game? It's not the whole game. Oh, I thought it was just a, it's not the whole game. Oh, it's its own

620
02:45:37,690 --> 02:45:44,840
thing. What? Okay. I didn't know that. I'm going to look into that now. I thought it was the whole

621
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:59,940
game. Okay. All right. All right. Anything after the credits? Cut. Brilliant. Congratulations, guys.

622
02:45:59,940 --> 02:46:07,700
That's a wrap. A wrap? That ending doesn't make any sense. Well, it's a wrap anyway. Oh, it was

623
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:22,819
just a horror movie. It was just a horror movie? Can I put the mic down now? Clapping the clapper

624
02:46:22,819 --> 02:46:33,030
is my job. All day. Clap, clap, clap. It's enough to drive you crazy. Okay. I would hate to have to

625
02:46:33,030 --> 02:46:39,139
edit this piece of shit. What do you think? I think it's stupid. Hey, how would I know Nick

626
02:46:39,139 --> 02:46:46,090
would skip town two days before we wrapped up the shoot? But Tom, he's not even tall enough to be

627
02:46:46,090 --> 02:46:55,719
to kill it. Don't worry about it. No one's going to notice. What? What's in the house? What's in

628
02:46:55,719 --> 02:47:12,260
the attic? Pizza. Any more pizza? No, your buddy Dan finished it up. I'm starving. There's plenty

629
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:33,989
of gelatin salad. Yeah, I'll think about that. It's not that bad. Gelatin salad? Is that? Wait,

630
02:47:33,989 --> 02:47:48,469
why is there blood here then? Is it fake blood? Maybe what happened to Nick, huh? Who? The guy

631
02:47:48,469 --> 02:47:53,290
who played the Easter Ripper. Oh, that guy? He was a weirdo. He didn't say anything to me the whole

632
02:47:53,290 --> 02:48:24,139
shoot. Easter Ripper costumes. Okay. So what's in the basement then? Anything in the basement?

633
02:48:24,139 --> 02:49:01,829
Save the game? I don't think I need to. It's post credits. Okay. So what's down here? Skeletons?

634
02:49:01,829 --> 02:49:50,569
Yeah. Thank you. It took me so long to pose them. So what the heck? What am I supposed to do? What

635
02:49:50,569 --> 02:49:57,799
am I going to do? Tuber commentary? This would be a pretty shitty tuber commentary. I'm just going

636
02:49:57,799 --> 02:50:11,500
like this. Where do I go? Do I go down? Where do I go? This would be pretty awful with tuber commentary.

637
02:50:11,500 --> 02:50:22,440
Oh, can I get a poll in chat? I need to get a poll in chat from a mod. When you brush your teeth,

638
02:50:22,440 --> 02:50:57,799
dude, sometimes you go, it's very important. Do you gag? I guess. I don't know. Not every time,

639
02:50:57,799 --> 02:51:10,790
but sometimes you just kind of go like, and I'm not talking like crazy. That was a little too

640
02:51:10,790 --> 02:51:30,739
too much. I don't mean like, I mean very lightly, just like a, no, guys, you don't brush your teeth

641
02:51:30,739 --> 02:51:40,329
and go, oh my God. I'm not talking about like this. Why can I not open this thing? I'm not talking

642
02:51:40,329 --> 02:51:50,010
about going like, no, I'm talking about like when you brush your tongue. I'm not sitting there

643
02:51:50,010 --> 02:52:14,979
brushing my teeth and I was puking. That'd be weird. What do you mean you don't brush your tongue?

644
02:52:14,979 --> 02:52:20,500
Oh, we've got some people in this chat with some fucking stank ass breath. You don't brush your

645
02:52:20,500 --> 02:53:00,409
tongue? Okay. I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking at here. What? There's nothing here.

646
02:53:00,409 --> 02:53:15,110
Brush your tongue. I just, I not, you don't have to do it. Fine. That's fine. But I brush my tongue

647
02:53:15,110 --> 02:53:24,700
because yeah, you can have like smelly breath. Go to the front door. What was in the attic?

648
02:53:24,700 --> 02:53:44,469
20% of chatters. Hold on. Do you brush your tongue? You don't, don't, I'm not talking to go crazy.

649
02:53:44,469 --> 02:53:48,229
It's just very light, but maybe that would explain why maybe 20% of you don't go,

650
02:53:49,430 --> 02:53:58,020
but even the people that do brush their tongue, I feel like that's maybe you say, I do, I do

651
02:53:58,020 --> 02:54:05,079
brush my tongue, but dude, why, what are you doing? But sometimes you're in a fucking hurry.

652
02:54:05,079 --> 02:54:09,000
Sometimes it's like, oh, I got to brush my teeth, but I got something to do. So I got somewhere to

653
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:15,479
be real quick. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Okay. All right. Go, go, go. Rinse, rinse, rinse,

654
02:54:15,479 --> 02:54:29,459
rinse, rinse. Sometimes it happens. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here. Something's

655
02:54:29,459 --> 02:54:37,270
supposed to happen. Somebody's missing. You need to go to bed. I'm going to play one round of vampire

656
02:54:37,270 --> 02:55:01,829
survivors. I don't know where to go. Do you guys have a, I'm not reading that one. Okay. Well,

657
02:55:01,829 --> 02:55:20,219
that was cool. I can't, I, it's cut off, but I think it's when wiping your ass. Can you imagine

658
02:55:20,219 --> 02:55:24,540
somebody is, Hey man, I'll be right back. I'm going to take a shit. Yeah. I'm just going to

659
02:55:24,540 --> 02:55:37,930
use your bathroom for a little bit. And they leave. You just hear it's like, holy shit. Like,

660
02:55:37,930 --> 02:55:44,889
what do you mean? Are you like, you're wiping your ass and are you like puking or like gagging

661
02:55:44,889 --> 02:56:01,399
because it smells? I'm 36 and we're going to move on. Okay. It smells so bad in the bathroom that

662
02:56:01,479 --> 02:56:08,489
you're gagging to your own business, dude. Okay. I'm 36 this time. We have to move on. I can,

663
02:56:08,489 --> 02:56:15,370
this is ridiculous. This is a ridiculous conversation to have. Do I just walk home?

664
02:56:15,370 --> 02:56:42,170
Where do I go? Just in the bathroom taking a shit. What are you doing? Rehearsing for my next role.

665
02:56:42,170 --> 02:56:49,700
What's that? Bikini babes on werewolf planet. I play queen Zion. Except you want to help with the

666
02:56:49,860 --> 02:56:58,459
part. Sure. Queen Zion. People are realizing you're 36.

667
02:57:07,959 --> 02:57:13,319
Isn't it in my info? I should put it in my info.

668
02:57:19,459 --> 02:57:28,739
You think I'm a fool? Take their bikinis. You'll have to settle for just

669
02:57:28,739 --> 02:57:45,799
a bit. What do you think? You're great. You look 26. It's wild. It's called I

670
02:57:45,799 --> 02:57:54,920
moisturize. I moisturize my skin. Everybody says question mark. What are you talking about? When

671
02:57:54,920 --> 02:58:04,459
I come out of the shower, brush my teeth, I dry my hair, I shampoo and condition at least once,

672
02:58:04,459 --> 02:58:14,329
twice a week. You don't be careful not to shampoo too much, but I usually do. So when I come out of

673
02:58:14,329 --> 02:58:22,620
the shower, dry off and I use, you want to know what I use? Would you like to know? You want to

674
02:58:22,620 --> 02:58:30,229
know what I use? You want to know what brand I use? Is that what this is? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Fine.

675
02:58:30,229 --> 02:58:38,010
Sure. I use the, it's, it's called the belief cream and it's called the Aqua bomb. You can get

676
02:58:38,010 --> 02:58:46,200
it at Sephora. I've been using it for fucking a decade almost every day. I'm not shit. I'm not

677
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:54,340
kidding. It's the belief cream. It's called the Aqua bomb. It's this light. This is, that was

678
02:58:54,340 --> 02:59:03,350
blinking for a second and you just do a little bit. It's really light. It's kind of like a gel

679
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:27,180
and this is how, when you're 40, you'll look fucking 25. Damn it. I look good. How do I leave

680
02:59:27,180 --> 02:59:51,819
the trailer? You're 40? Not yet. Okay. So how do I get it through this? It's nighttime,

681
02:59:51,819 --> 03:00:08,309
$40 moisturizer. Everybody shut up. That moisturizer will last you a very long time,

682
03:00:08,309 --> 03:00:15,020
an incredibly long time. This is not, you don't open the container and smear it like, like pick

683
03:00:15,020 --> 03:00:19,100
it up like this and then drag it all over your face. You didn't use the whole bowl.

684
03:00:20,920 --> 03:00:26,739
You do a dab. You open up the container. You take your ring finger or your middle finger,

685
03:00:29,100 --> 03:00:33,670
just a little bit, and then get it on the cheekbones right here under the eyes. Don't

686
03:00:33,670 --> 03:00:38,969
put it in your eyes. Are you crazy? Come up here onto the forehead, on the nose, the chin,

687
03:00:38,969 --> 03:00:48,780
and then cleanly smear it around in a semi-circle. You're not going like this and drenching your

688
03:00:48,860 --> 03:00:56,219
face. No, that will last you two, three months. And guess what? Taking care of your skin,

689
03:00:56,219 --> 03:01:01,059
the biggest organ. I bet you didn't know this. You're a scientist. It's the biggest organ in

690
03:01:01,059 --> 03:01:04,469
your whole body. You got to take care of it. It's the biggest organ in your whole body.

691
03:01:04,469 --> 03:01:11,030
You should be taking care of it. Bet you didn't know that. I'm going to quit the game because I

692
03:01:11,030 --> 03:01:14,299
don't know what to do. If you don't want me to quit the game and see the last bit of the ending,

693
03:01:14,299 --> 03:01:55,450
just tell me where to go. The other trailer. What's wrong with you? Too many pizzas.

694
03:01:55,450 --> 03:02:06,379
How many did you eat? Three. Slices? No, pizzas. I was bored. Not much left to do since I died.

695
03:02:06,379 --> 03:02:13,510
Oh, thank God. Maybe someone could give me a ride into town off this hell set.

696
03:02:13,510 --> 03:02:20,680
Yeah, skincare. Take care of your skin. You know people really got killed in this house.

697
03:02:20,680 --> 03:02:29,299
That's just a rumor. Watch how much sun you're getting. It's nice to get sun, but just be

698
03:02:29,299 --> 03:02:37,000
careful how much sun you're getting. You know, you don't want to be out there just cooking. Use

699
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:45,610
a good moisturizer. No one cares. I do. I need a hot shower after this sleazy picture. I do.

700
03:02:50,920 --> 03:03:02,309
I do. All right, so that was fun. That was fun. I'm going to just leave now. Go to the car.

701
03:03:02,309 --> 03:03:17,239
What temperature are your showers? I wouldn't say too hot. Not too hot. Not too cold. Hot, hot,

702
03:03:17,239 --> 03:03:31,399
hot showers. They kind of make me feel weird. I don't like it. I don't have my keys. I must

703
03:03:31,399 --> 03:03:45,079
have dropped them somewhere. Oh, where are my keys? The keys are in the basement. Somebody said I'm

704
03:03:45,079 --> 03:03:55,159
literally buying that. I don't like moisturizers that are really heavy, greasy. Cream. It's not a

705
03:03:55,159 --> 03:04:09,620
cream. It's a light gel cream. It's not what you think. It's not one of those. Nope. It's light.

706
03:04:09,620 --> 03:04:31,399
You're giving ads for free. I don't care. I've talked about things that I use in company. I can't

707
03:04:31,399 --> 03:04:42,680
just say that I like something. Somebody has to pay me to tell you that I like a product. That's

708
03:04:42,680 --> 03:05:11,030
not going to happen. I mean, if they do. All right. Where are these keys? That's not a requirement

709
03:05:11,030 --> 03:05:21,770
in the basement. I'm in the basement. Where are these keys? Come on. Come on, Gwen. Really?

710
03:05:21,770 --> 03:05:40,739
For here? In the dungeon? When are you going to do a skincare stream? Do you know where my keys are?

711
03:05:40,739 --> 03:05:56,379
So much to do down here. There are my keys. Hey, hey, hey. What are those? What are those

712
03:05:56,379 --> 03:06:04,040
brown slacks called? Oh, they're called cockies. How do you drive your car off with fucking cockies?

713
03:06:04,040 --> 03:06:37,209
Could have been playing vampire survivors. Smash the desk. Okay. Bye guys. It was fun making the

714
03:06:37,209 --> 03:06:59,690
movie. I really hope it's not a real killer that comes out and grabs me. Let's party. Did you guys

715
03:06:59,690 --> 03:07:09,049
have to ruin all of these costumes? You shouldn't have eaten any gelatin salad. You're weird for

716
03:07:09,049 --> 03:07:30,500
eating it in the first place. I shot about 30 slashing movies this year. All that hard work

717
03:07:30,500 --> 03:07:55,190
finally paid off. I feel like I would be dancing like this too. That was a fun party. All right.

718
03:07:55,190 --> 03:08:15,430
Goodbye. That was a fun party. What? Oh, I'm not cleaning up. I'm sorry. If you are at the party,

719
03:08:15,430 --> 03:08:20,760
then you clean up. If I walk through the party to say goodbye, I am not obligated to clean up the

720
03:08:20,760 --> 03:08:29,209
party. That's not how that works. If I'm not participating in the party, then I'm not going

721
03:08:29,209 --> 03:08:53,020
to clean up the party. Oh my God. Look at the backseat. What is that? Oh my goodness. I'm so

722
03:08:53,020 --> 03:09:14,069
nervous. I did. Okay. We did. I did. I could have just ended like 30 minutes ago. All right. Let's

723
03:09:14,069 --> 03:09:20,020
do vampire survivors. That was a good game. That's fun. I actually enjoyed that. Give me one second

724
03:09:20,020 --> 03:09:22,899
while I open up vampire survivors.
