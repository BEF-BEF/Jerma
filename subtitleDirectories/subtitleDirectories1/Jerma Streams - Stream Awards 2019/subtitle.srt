1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:14,789
Everybody's gone crazy. They've all gone crazy. I look over at the chat. I just see I see just like a huge

2
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:17,879
wave of fire

3
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,210
a fucking fire

4
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:23,289
Uh, hi guys. Yeah, sorry. I

5
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,899
There's a lot of videos to get through

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,750
I had to load them all up

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,630
I've been doing it. Uh, i've been doing it all day

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,149
I left my room in fucking 16 hours

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:45,909
Why don't we have wine on me already? This doesn't make any sense

10
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,979
And this isn't even this ain't it's anybody

11
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,579

12
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,299
Happy new year everybody if you've already uh

13
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:07,430
If you've already celebrated it if you're from, you know forward in time rather than backwards in time like we are here in america

14
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,590
This is going to be

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,590
Sort of like the thing we did last year

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,379
if

17
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,239
You remember that

18
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,120
we

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,959
Chilled up for a little bit

20
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,159
We did

21
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,799
the worst and best things of the year

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,290
We're doing it again

23
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,370
This time there are there are almost twice as many categories this year

24
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,409
Almost double the categories

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,409
double the fun

26
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:40,409
half the categories

27
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:42,489
Uh, the half the categories are

28
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:48,250
for instance i'm just gonna get i'm gonna just no spoilers, but a best auto moment

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,719
was just

30
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,799
Each time my dog actually appeared on stream and it was like five times

31
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,310
so

32
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,739
They all right. There you go

33
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,849
If you're new to the channel

34
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:10,729
You're probably going to be like what kind of a sick ego fucking maniac has like a look at how my stream awards

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,969
Well, uh, it's most of these are the worst things i've done on stream this year

36
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm talking worse joke worse noise worst impression

37
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,699
Worst overall stream. There's also a few best ones. There are some best ones. We're not going to go all bad

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,599
because you know, I mean come on we got we got worst joke of the decade on here too and

a lot of categories

41
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,289
Number four might surprise you

42
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:44,689
23 in total

43
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:50,550
That's a quick minus two. Uh, yeah, it was intentional quick. It's just a just a quick quick intentional minus two. Not a big deal

44
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,620
Anyways, thanks for voting. Thanks for participating

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,060
We're gonna do something first before because I want people to trickle in

46
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,659
We talked about this yesterday

47
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:08,180

And the pre-show is uh, look at all the bootleg dog shit that people have made illegally of my image on redbubble

57
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,379
Should be fun

58
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,500
There are quite a few things in here that don't make very much sense. But you know

59
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,939
We saw this yesterday figured we have to do this

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,280
I didn't play the right music either

63
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:17,980
Budgets were cut this year as you can tell

64
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,500

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,540

Who's who is

72
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,819
This year instead of being in the studio

73
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,620

74
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:02,170

It's the same suit from last year

91
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,920
That's how you can tell

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,769
It's way too long and the arms are too short. I didn't even buy you only who cares

93
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
All you see is from here down. Anyways

94
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,199
What's on the floor of papers?

95
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:40,620
What's wrong with that? So I got some papers on my floor. Who cares? It's a messy room. It's not no, it's not

96
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,519
Those are footprints

97
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,519
These are these are these are not these are

98
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,850

Look see

103
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:14,069
It's it's just the way the carpet is. It's a long fly carpet. My fly is up, right?

104
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,250
See

105
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,410
It doesn't just like that to be dragging my feet across the ground

106
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,120
You want to see what's on the paper?

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,689
fine blank

108
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,870
I dropped the package of computer

109
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,220
And this one this one is not

110
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,100
It's all it is like but it has dog hair all over if you want to see this one

111
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,620
here

112
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
I dropped the dog hair all over one on the ground

113
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,899
All right, i'm gonna come clean

114
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,050
My fucking printer is on the ground

115
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,259
Why is there a printer on the ground? Well, look, it's very simple

116
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:21,750
I don't have any room in in my office for anything. I have this big really nice desk right here and that's it

117
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,620
There's nothing else here

118
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,819
so I

119
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,379
I have consoles here. I have consoles here

120
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,139

121
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,899
monitors and shit

122
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,899
I thought there's no room for a printer

123
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,110
Get a larger desk. This is one of the biggest desks you could buy but what before it being a pain in the ass

124
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,519
This is like 72 inches long and like

125
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,399
like 60 inches wide

126
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,840
This is all right. Let's go

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080

The germa rainbow

176
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,179
This has doesn't have anything to do with me

177
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:53,419
What does this have to do with me?

178
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,419
It's just like a weird knitted pattern

179
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:00,250
What was what? Oh, it's a it's my face

180

I'm not going to buy this. Why would I buy this?

185
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500

00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:47,370
image theft

187
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,529
Uh, this this is my face

188
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,700
Why would I buy the product that's taking my likeness and selling it? Why would I do that?

189
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:16,629
I do like this, uh, like the default guy that's just uh here though. It's pretty funny. All right, let's keep going

00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,639
11 hour seaman lockdown long sleeve t-shirt

196
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:50,169
I survived the 11 hour seaman lockdown. I watched germa stream seaman for 11 hours 9 minutes and 58 seconds

197
00:14:50,809 --> 00:15:04,070
All right. I i'll let this one i'll let this one slide. I'll let that one slide

198

What this is germa 985 germa 985 have a nice day

202
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,990
Have a nice day. Don't be an accessory to make the 100 billion plastic bags in the u

203
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,110
Wait, what is this?

204
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:41,529
Why is there a plastic bag warning?

205
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:46,490
Oh, this is hold on

206
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,179
Look at this

207
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,820
Did a bot just rip this somehow and put this on here?

208
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:56,379
Why would the bot algorithm say do all this?

209
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:03,100
German 985 germa 985 and has nothing to do with rats

210
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,899
Have a nice day

211
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,059
Warning to avoid danger of suffocation keep this plastic bag away from babies and children

212
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,820
Do not use this bag in cribs beds carriages or play pens

213
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,940
The plastic bag could block nose and mouth and prevent breathing

214
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,899
In fact, this plastic bag is so destructive to the environment that if you really care about the future

215
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,779
You could seriously just reuse paper bags from here on out. This bag is not a toy

216
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,659
Don't be an accessory to make the 100 billion plastic bags in the u.s

217
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,980
Each year it makes it 12 billion barrels of oil

218
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,669
I mean

219
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:46,549
That's not that's not that's not a bad message, right? But I what do I have to do with?

220
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,860
plastic bag

221
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,860
Are they implying that I use them all the time?

222
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:03,559
Why have to why am I on here? Oh, I don't whatever let's keep going

223
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,750
And they say this is a plastic bag. It's not this is not a plastic bag

224
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,480
Uh the spies that's a classic. Okay spies

225
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,589
The germa 985 do they cover?

226
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:23,740
Interesting

227
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,940
This is 86 bucks for a twin

228
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,609
All right. Well, what is uh, what does a king look like?

229
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,130
131 dollars

230
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,950
I feel like this is a scam though. Are you even gonna get it?

231
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,630
But what if you don't get like what is it? Are you even gonna get this or is it just a bot in?

232
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,990
I'm so confused

233
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,950
Read the reviews all the reviews are copy pasted. Remember we looked at this

234
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:09,960
Love the new duvet cover love the new duvet cover, but it did not come with matching pillowcases

235
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,279
Probably in the fine print but I was a little disappointed because the duvet cover was so cool

236
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:18,700
Extremely nice high quality high quality with beautiful graphics

237
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:23,119
I don't I don't know what this is

238
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,519
This product was just what this product was just what I hoped my daughter absolutely loves it

00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,859
You see this same shit on ios

240
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
We've gotten to a point

241
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,359
On the internet where nothing is real

242
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,609
If you if you go to a review site and fucking

243
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:44,170
5,000

244
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,970
Comments 5,000 reviews are on a product

245
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:51,849
Maybe 25 of those are real, right? I mean, how can you even tell there's no way?

246
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:55,259
I mean you can tell because

247
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,230
But what if these are real people?

248
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,230
These might be real people

249
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:13,240
I don't know. Well, i'm not buying it. Uh, germa slim fit t-shirt. It's just the

Yeah, what's with the old west font?

256
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,089

More than thirty percent of you. I disagree

489

sometimes he shows up on stream and these are

493
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:52,369
This was not supposed to be a category, but it is

494
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,789
For some reason you have a dog. Yeah, I mean there's eight thousand people here

495
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,269
Best auto moment that could be like that could be like somebody that lives down the street

496
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:06,579
If you've never been here before so

497
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:10,349

503
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,050

504
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,920
Did I do that right? Oh, this is playing the whole video or this

505
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,820

He's eight years old. He's fantastic. I love him

526
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:06,860
Hey, I don't

Hello, that's just a clip right behind me

528
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:17,219
This category sucks. I was I was bullied into putting this in. I was bullied into putting this in

529
00:43:18,019 --> 00:43:23,920
Yeah, it's me

530
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:30,420
He's like, what are you doing?

531
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,780
There you go

532
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,780
Auto spotted. This is just what he does guy

533
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:49,260
Hey

534
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:56,019
Hey, hey, what are you doing? This is sad. This is a sad song. Are you napping in here?

535
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,099
No, it's not

536
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:03,630
Look at that tail ready. Hey, thanks for the subs by the way. Hey

537
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:07,010

Uh glucose amino chondroitin

539
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:12,059
Oh, what do I do? What do I get?

540
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:23,070
Uh, yes if you um

541
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:30,530
When your dog only shows up four times on stream you have to reach for something else to put in the category list

542
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,780
Uh, it was the flash in the corner and what am I gonna think?

543
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,329
That was auto

544
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:41,730
uh, and the winner for best auto moment of 2019 is going to go to

545
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:49,519
Who cares

546
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,599
Picross interruption auto picross 27 percent of the vote

547
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,980
What do you mean rude? Well, I I love this dog

548
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:09,739
But all those clips with the same clip and with all the besides there was all the same video

549
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,710
Otto, would you like it? Would you like to say something auto?

550
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:27,340
All right, zoom in on that and put it on the list for next year. We saw the tail wag. Yeah

551
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:35,119
All right coming up next is I don't think I do I need to introduce this one

552
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:43,619
Are you sure you want me to introduce?

553
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,599
it's uh

554
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,360
ladies and gentlemen the nominees

555
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,360
Uh for worst speeder of the year

556
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:07,840
Parker griffin and dinklage all famous faces sharing this common name. Dr. Schmoinson. Yes, I believe that is

557
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,030
Beater who is beater?

558
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,269
Who what is beater?

559
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:19,469
Why is he not talking? I I mean

560
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:26,110
I'm just trying to focus to get back to the 500 beaters in seven and a half minutes six and a half minutes

561
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:37,969
Still not big enough to get these

562
00:46:38,449 --> 00:46:51,599
It's a goddamn maze beater

563
00:46:52,480 --> 00:47:00,530
It's a maze beater

564
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,840
Okay, that was kind of funny. Not really

565
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:12,780
I think I got it. We're good. Hey, but we're in the end game here

566
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,889
How do you leave your voicemail on a public phone?

567
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:42,210
Later, uh, this year's worst feeder of the year

568
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:49,820
What do you think what do you think what was the worst? Uh, what was the worst budget?

569
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,380
I told you we're getting this shitty

570
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,619
Okay, auto was a fine category

571
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:57,460
Best question. So that auto was the only one that didn't make sense

572
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:05,940
What do you think?

573
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:11,019
Dr. Schmoinson beater for 32 percent of the vote by a lot actually

574
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:18,369
What was in second place? Let me see the schmoinson beater was apparently the worst one

575
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:22,130
But I don't know if I agree with that. I think I disagree with that one

576
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,690
The academy I think was got that one wrong

577
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,550
Uh, what came in second place?

578
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,550
Because that was 30 32 percent

579
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:35,250
Worst beater. Where is it?

580
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,489
Anyway, no, it was close. It was pretty close

581
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,110
So voicemail peter

582
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,630
Was the next one

583
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,949
Which was at 23 percent of the vote

584
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,820
so

585
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,690
Not a huge spread

586
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,409
By the way, this category will not return next year. I promise. I know I said that last year. I

587
00:48:56,539 --> 00:49:02,380
I I promise this will not return next year. Please clip this and save it somewhere because don't let me do this again

588
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:04,820
in fact

589
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:13,940
Now that means I can't ever do it again this next category

590
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,500
Lying. Why is that a lie?

591
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
Not quite not yet. Not a lie yet

592
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,460
anyways moving on to uh

593
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:30,059
Hold on. Let me like burp internally this next category is

594
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,880
No, actually the next

595
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,320
Two categories in a row have to do with my physical appearance

596
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:40,849
Uh, we're coming up with next worst hair of 2019

597
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:44,210
worst hair

598
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,940
uh

599
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,940
I like having long hair

600
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,460
I like having

601
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:54,260
It shaped and be able to lay back behind my ears and have it. I I like having hair like this

602
00:49:54,739 --> 00:49:56,739
Maybe not this long in particular, but

603
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,980
uh

604
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,059
Sometimes especially when it gets hot in here if i'm doing something or if things get a little

605
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,619
I've been streaming for six seven plus eight hours in a row and I don't get up and I go to the bathroom

606
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:11,300
I sit back down. Sometimes it gets a little messed up and there's not much you can do about that

607
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:16,380
And these are the times that people said was the worst it's ever looked on string

608
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:24,179
You I could throw water in my face into my hair, but then it gets all wet and stringy. I don't like it

609
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,880
So here you are. Here are your nominees for worst hair of 2019

610
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,619
Doesn't need that much more of an introduction

611
00:50:33,940 --> 00:51:16,860
Why do you have braided hair? I'm leaving it. I ain't gonna fix it. Fuck that

612
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,860
It's a fucking drunk

613
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:22,420
God

614
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,420
It just it just happened. I don't know how

615
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:30,719
I have no idea

616
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,119
I don't I don't know why that happened. This is drunk as i've been on stream

617
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,760
This looks as I don't even care

618
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,639
You know, like you sometimes you give a shit about your appearance like when i'm when the when the webcam goes on, right?

619
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,559
And I know the webcams on usually i'm a little self-conscious, you know, I want to make sure that I look okay

620
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,480
How's my face looking? Do I look all right? Do I look okay?

621
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:53,199
I don't care right now and you can just tell

622
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,760
And this is like these images are gonna come back to haunt me in like fucking two years

623
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:00,320
Or one

624
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
Like I don't even care. Like I just don't

625
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,559
Typically i'd be like, oh hold on before I turn the camera on let me like okay

626
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:11,900
I know my hair is wicked fucked up because I was in the wind

627
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:18,340
I I know my hair looks like fucking al dente spaghetti today and that's because I was out in the wind

628
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,900
I was in the wind

629
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,900
sire

630
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:27,699
You have so many dropped frames and my family needs to use the internet and go to amazon

631
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:35,940
And buy cases of ocean can I nominate this for worse zip 2019 because that's and small small figurines of

632
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,099
Venom we need to and then he looks over

633
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:46,820
And he finally makes a decision right is filming off my camera

634
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,570
Hey, thanks

So what do you guys want to do? I can I can barely do anything. I I really don't want to lie to you guys

638
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,280

How are you doing? How's everything going? How are the kids?

640
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:31,730
Yeah, I don't know. I'm on the kind of screens of people under the bridge now, you know, that's what I do

641
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:34,690
It's been real. I just didn't get the job done

643
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:50,800
A lot of good cat a lot of good nominees there a lot of good nominees, but they can only be one winner

644
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:58,860
Unfortunately, they can only be one and the winner for the worst hair in 2019 is going to go to

645
00:54:08,429 --> 00:54:09,469
this

646
00:54:09,469 --> 00:54:13,659

With 35 percent of the vote guy under the bridge came in with about 27 percent

649
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:42,980
Worst hair of the year if I were to pick that one if it were going to be me

652
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,780
The vr trainwreck hair came in third place

653
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,989
with 19 percent of the vote but

654
00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:04,480
My god

655
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,480
It was un it was ridiculous. It looked like it was made it looked like it was dirty

656
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,159
It was dirty and greasy and looked like somebody put a bunch of hair gel in it and squished it together and held it

657
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:16,320
Tighten and fucking let it go after like an hour

658
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,219

This is the worst face i've ever made on stream

665
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:55,519
In 2019 whether it's being shocked or trying to make do something funny that doesn't come across as funny. It's just ugly and strange

666
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,079

00:58:27,969 --> 00:58:30,340

after big lipstick

675
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:37,019
farting and screaming playlist

676
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,010
was

677
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,050
In second place at 13 percent and then the greedy grinner

678
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:47,090
at 13.08 percent which was farting scream was 13.2

679
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:50,289
Everything was very close recent bias. Maybe

680
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,039
maybe

681
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,599
But it is written down there very sloppily because you can tell the stream was late today, right?

682
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,480
We started we started the appointments like and there's a few reasons for that reasons are for what you're about to see

683
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:04,719
I had to get these written down and i'm just like

684
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,800
red lipstick

685
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:13,019
Because I got I got these

686
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:16,380
From I told you from amazon and i'm going do I just fucking do do I just like

687
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,900
Do I go to a store right now and get some more of these do I go to a store?

688
00:59:20,929 --> 00:59:23,489
I freaked out and I was like, I just got whatever it doesn't matter

689
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:29,260
I was like about to get in the car and about to go. Uh, no, whatever. Okay

690
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,150
Just put them on the little ones

691
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,909
He's a professional streamer, by the way

692
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:37,309
No, I told you there were budget cuts this year that last year we were in a studio and I had all like that

693
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:39,070
A big allowed of trophies

694
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:49,630
We had to cut a few uh corners this year. What are you doing? What are you doing? What is this?

695
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,630
Why is we're spamming this? What is this?

696
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,710
This is spamming so fast. I can't even

697
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:02,460
All right. It's not january 1st, by the way

698
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:04,289
so

699
01:00:04,289 --> 01:00:07,550
this uh

700
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,710
You can't uh, you can't nominate this

701
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,579
I'm such a fucking cartoon character

702
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,940
I

703
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:51,980
Can't even replicate that

704
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,739
That's apex twin

705
01:00:53,739 --> 01:00:59,659
Do wait, did we say who it was? Yeah, it was a big lipstick. Of course it was moving along

706
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:02,539
Now we're moving into categories that

707
01:01:03,309 --> 01:01:05,550
Potentially have a lot of nominees

708
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:10,030
Last year, this was an incredibly last second thing besides being in the studio

709
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:16,989
Uh, this was an insanely last second thing last year and really try to get as many good high quality

710
01:01:17,949 --> 01:01:19,949
Categories as possible first, right?

711
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:25,809
This year and people only had like two or three days to nominate stuff and it was because it was bang bang bang

712
01:01:25,969 --> 01:01:27,650
It was really quick last year

713
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,769
but

714
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:32,769
This year people had about a week and a half or so to figure out what they wanted to nominate and

715
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:39,550
There were a lot of nominees in some of these worse noise had like 25 nominees

716
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,829
We had to shave some off

717
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:48,190
It's a lot of nominees in some of these categories and we're going to show I think this one's doesn't not quite yet

718
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,940
But moving on to worst singing of the year, this is a new category

719
01:01:53,489 --> 01:01:55,010
by the way

720
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:58,050
Both of these categories are the same category

721
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,639
The nominees in this category are no better than the nominees in this category

722
01:02:06,179 --> 01:02:09,619
They I could switch these in my hands right now and you would not know the difference

723
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:13,539
so

724
01:02:13,539 --> 01:02:14,980
We'll go ahead

725
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,139
And start with worst singing of the year

726
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:43,039
Let's see what the nominees are and this is the one that goes rolling around at the speed of sound

727
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,730
Right something like that

728
01:03:03,869 --> 01:03:05,869
Sing him a song. Oh

729
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:09,119
Holy fuck that was horrible

730
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,260
Oh canada

731
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:17,420
Our home and sacred land

732
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:27,469
True patriot side and all thy sons command

733
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:29,789
with

734
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:34,780
Street rat street rat. I am not a street rat

735
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,820
Gotta go to sleep gotta have some cheap gotta have some fun while I have time

736
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:46,710
Oh

737
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,250
I love the music in the background of the music

738
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:28,679
Worst singing of the year, apparently

739
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:29,639
Oh

740
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:32,440
This one wasn't even a fucking contest

741
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:35,480
Not even close not even close

742
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,800
This is ridiculous how unbelievable this was skewed

743
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,159
the winner of worst singing of

744
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:48,219
2019 with

745
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:51,380
50 percent of the vote and you have to remember

746
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:56,449
There were one two, three, four five six seven nominees in this category

747
01:04:57,090 --> 01:05:01,059
The category the nominee after that had 13 percent

748
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:05,090
And it was eehee never gonna give you up

749
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:16,530
uh

750
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:17,969
Also, by the way

751
01:05:17,969 --> 01:05:24,929
This is the first win of i got a feeling singing stream and second nomination of the night for worst stream of the year upcoming

752
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:29,219
That's on here a few times

753
01:05:29,219 --> 01:05:31,139
That stream is on here

754
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,909
More than once also nominated for worst stream of the whole year

755
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:51,329
Okay, uh now it's best singing is now this is best singing

756
01:05:51,889 --> 01:05:55,010
By the way, you'll see what i'm talking about when I say they both get the same damn category

757
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,210
I should have just had a singing category where like two people won

758
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:02,079
Here are the categories and the nominees

759
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,150
for best singing of the year

760
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,960
I will never stop it

761
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:48,469
Uh

762
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,750
You got a friend in me

763
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,599
You got a friend in me

764
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,800

765
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:16,659
I told you I told you

766
01:07:20,949 --> 01:07:22,949
I'm so fucking angry right now

767
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:44,309
I can't even tell who's talking i'm gonna lose again. I was singing you can't you can't hear this is all fucking

768
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:48,230
Why is it like this

769
01:07:55,059 --> 01:08:06,130
G

770
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:29,369
Of the 1,400 people that unfollowed tonight, um, I hope to see you soon. Hope to see you back

771
01:08:57,699 --> 01:08:59,699
Only 17

772
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:10,949
You can dance you can laugh having the time of your life

773
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:29,439
All right, you know

774
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,119
Shit plays back to you

775
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:33,119
And you know, you've seen it you've heard it before

776
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,279
And you just you're looking at what you've done over the last year and you just kind of go

777
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,039
I now I understand what people think I do drugs on stream

778
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,340
You know what I mean? I got it. I get what you mean now when you say like, oh, hey

779
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:48,340
Is this dude like do fucking drugs?

780
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It's kind of hard to defend

781
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:55,079
Against these nominees

782
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:56,359
anyways

783
01:09:56,359 --> 01:10:00,199
The winner of best singing you already know what it is. Do I even need to do the fanfare?

784
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:04,840
Do I ever need to tell you do I it was if it was on the list it was gonna win, you know that

785
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:17,039
Qrs from the mind show stream at 30 percent of the vote

786
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,119
This was not as uh as far away as you thought it was

787
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
30 voted for qrs

788
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:28,229
Uh green day was after that

789
01:10:29,909 --> 01:10:33,750
Somehow singing a katamari song was in third place with 16 percent of the vote

790
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,520
Which you couldn't it was me going like this. I know people are gonna fucking freak out

791
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:44,880
People are gonna be really upset with me and they're gonna tell me to stop but I need to show you what people are gonna say

792
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,520
Don't fucking do that. Don't stop doing that. But I need to you just need to hear it

793
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:58,199
That's what I was doing i'm not I do it I didn't do it for long I didn't do it for very long calm down

794
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,920
That's what I was doing. I was humming that to the beat

795
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,640
Apparently 16 percenting it thought that was the best thing i've done all year

796
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:06,600
I that's just what i'm not gonna go i'm not doing anymore

797
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:12,279
Those are new categories, by the way, this next category is

798
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:16,689
One of my favorites

799
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,689
best one guy moment of the year

800
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:22,979
Best one guy what is one guy moment for those of you that might be new to the channel

801
01:11:23,939 --> 01:11:25,859
uh one guy

802
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:31,220
Is especially a one guy moment is when one person in the stream in the chat

803
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:37,409
Can either throw off the entire stream or can dictate the conversation exactly where it goes

804
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:40,130
I'll look over I will read something that somebody says

805
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:41,970
and

806
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:45,010
It will change the course of the entire history of the channel

807
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,039
so

808
01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:50,039
If you stay on this stream

809
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:52,600
There's a possibility that you will one day be the one guy

810
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:57,800
That I would look over and say hey dude, like eat a ghost pepper on stream and i'll go. All right fucking cool, dude. Sure

811
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,279
I mean i'm not gonna do that, but I can at least pretend to right?

812
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,119
Uh best one here the nominees for best one guy moment of the year

813
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:11,119
A couple of these chicks shouldn't even fucking be on here, but I they made me laugh for a second. So they're on here

814
01:12:12,789 --> 01:12:14,789
Oh, okay. Here we go

I don't know

828
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:19,399
How tough it is to be able to determine what's fucking real and not real?

829
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,800
This is the image. This is the original actual image that for those of you watching the vlog

830
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,909
This is the image

831
01:14:27,909 --> 01:14:29,909
somebody linked this

832
01:14:30,229 --> 01:14:35,029
Like really like that could it could be but it's not even though it could

833
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:50,310
Best one guy moment of the year

834
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:52,310
Oh, this is uh, this is a landslide

835
01:15:00,949 --> 01:15:04,069

47 of the vote. Yeah, uh, that was that was I was outrageous

837
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,720
I really truly thought that it was real at first

838
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:30,340
This next one is very close

839
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,340
But if you pull up that image

840
01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:34,310

843
01:15:49,829 --> 01:15:57,430
Breaking news twenty one twenty thousand nineteen twenty the year 2019 is getting a sequel that's said to replace the year 2020

844
01:15:59,859 --> 01:16:02,819

846
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,520

01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:32,130
Lil Nas

849
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:36,600
Giant ratted

850
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:46,289

851
01:16:46,289 --> 01:16:48,289

853
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:03,350
This can't be a fake account. Is this a fake account? No, holy shit

854
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,180
And the award for best tweet of 2019 goes to

855
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:19,060
Oh my god, that's kind of fucking crazy

856
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:27,489
Uh, that's pretty cool. Is it fake?

857
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,130
It's not is it fake did I get faked out?

858
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:36,420
I'm so confused right now of what's happening. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right

859
01:17:36,979 --> 01:17:42,479
Hey

860
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:44,000
You know, i'm available

861
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:53,279
Just saying i'm available. I'm always available. I got nothing going on right now. I've got fucking nothing going on right now

862
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,119
besides just

863
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:57,119
Sweating in my shirt

864
01:17:58,819 --> 01:18:01,539
For what i'm i'm kidding. I'm kidding

865
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:08,500
Uh the next category

866
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,710
I'm people saying the music's a little too loud. I'm sorry about that

867
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:15,189
Uh, the music is baked into every video

868
01:18:15,989 --> 01:18:20,550
They were like 30 they were like 30 editors making these so like we try to get them as quick as we could

869
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,770
Can't fix

870
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,130
Sorry, you'll be all right

871
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:27,010
just

872
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:30,770
Fucking go like this

873
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:31,970
Okay

874
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:34,210
Uh worst vroom of the year if you don't know what a vroom is

875
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:38,260
a vroom

876
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:44,260
Is when I live in a place in by the way live in las vegas if you don't know, uh, I live in las vegas

877
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,260
and

878
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:50,500
I live in a spot where people like to either mod the fuck out of their cars

879
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,539
Or blow by the street that I live on

880
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:58,279
And it's really really irritating and it ruins streams. Sometimes it gets in the way

881
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,319
One actually happened about 30 or 40 minutes ago. So it happened already on this stream

882
01:19:04,789 --> 01:19:06,079
it

883
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:08,319
I lose concentration. It's it's really fucking annoying

884
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:09,760
so

885
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,520
these are the worst times that they happened on stream this year and

886
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:16,479
I'm not even sure how accurate these nominees are

887
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:19,319
because

888
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:24,520
There's been so many of these that I think people forget just how fucking loud and obnoxious they are

889
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,760
There are some real good ones on here

890
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:44,770
Really good ones. What are you looking? He's like it's got the same hair too. He's got the same mustache hair

891
01:19:45,329 --> 01:19:48,680
This could have been me

892
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:53,479
But if you know, you know, what's what's that joke like? Hey, i'm gonna tell my kids that like this was that that per

893
01:19:54,439 --> 01:20:01,000
Just tell your kids that I was the mask because look look at this

894
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,470
It really could be that

895
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:13,880
That that's just me with makeup on

896
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:29,510
That is it's just me that's me with makeup on my nose is too pointy and big man that guy

897
01:20:29,989 --> 01:20:31,890
All right, let's move on

898
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:36,050
This is worst room of the year coming up. I can't fucking

899
01:20:36,689 --> 01:20:56,770
That's that's crazy. It's crazy to me. All right, uh worst room of the year here in the nominees. Well get there. Let's go g

900
01:20:58,789 --> 01:21:03,270
Take me to the bary center. What the hell is going on here? Here we go

901
01:21:03,829 --> 01:21:05,829
Does it say if there's life on it?

902
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:19,250
All right, there's life on this planet or life on this one

903
01:21:24,449 --> 01:21:26,289
where's my little like the

904
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:28,369
Seismograph meter don't have one of those

905
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:44,289
Look up are those motorcycles in my room? I'm in vr. I can't tell

906
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:50,000
pistol

907
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,939
Shotgun shotgun. I don't like the shotgun

908
01:21:55,939 --> 01:22:00,979
Pretty good timing pretty good time

909
01:22:00,979 --> 01:22:03,300
It was a one minute and 12 seconds first lap

910
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,020
See you again in a minute and 15 seconds

911
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:09,720
I'm gonna give the shotgun

912
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:14,899
When I get the money

913
01:22:14,899 --> 01:22:18,340
All right, I just I felt like somebody was just going to just drive into the house

914
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:23,220
Like I really felt like somebody was going into the window like I thought that was somebody in a little drone

915
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:26,659
Flying and crashing into my window. That just scared the shit out of me

916
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:33,079
That was in the house. Yeah

917
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:39,239
That sounded fake if somebody's in a pod racer out here. That was a star wars fucking pod racer

918
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:42,560
That wasn't even a car

919
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,680
You you give her a little thing like oh say goodbye. You don't just like

920
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:55,810
flush

921
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:58,210
Whoa

922
01:22:58,689 --> 01:23:10,850
Keep her in a box. You really can't do that. Gabby will start to smell up the drawer

923
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:14,850
I'm glad I cannot fall down this unless I really fuck this part up right here

924
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:27,760
All right that fucking guy driving the car the guy in the fucking car that just sped by at a thousand miles per hour

925
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,560
It's just screened in my ear

926
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,960
What the fuck man?

927
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:42,050
That's so annoying

928
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,689
That's so annoying

929
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:46,689
Whatever. That's two that's I

930
01:23:47,329 --> 01:23:49,729
Give me a break though. Seriously. I get to be mad at that

931
01:23:52,609 --> 01:23:57,649
I get to be upset about that. That's so annoying and somebody's screaming outside your window as loud as they can

932
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,199
Like somebody just threw a glass bottle at my house while I took that jump

933
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:16,100
I'll get back up there. All right, you can hear that one was real

934
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,829
Yeah, I know you hear the fake one right now, but that one was real

935
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:28,899
that was not a

936
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,850
Uh, yeah, it happens all the time. It's such a pain in the ass

937
01:24:43,619 --> 01:24:44,979
and

938
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:49,060
It really it really is starting to become a pretty major problem. It really is

939
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:54,920
What would you guys say? Um, I would say

940
01:24:56,359 --> 01:25:01,560
Probably two or three times a stream, right? It has to be it has to be at least two or three times a stream

941
01:25:04,189 --> 01:25:07,119
soundproof your house

942
01:25:07,119 --> 01:25:09,079
Okay

943
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:11,159
Worst room of the year. This was very close

944
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:14,529
There is the closest one all night by the way

945
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:24,850
at

946
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,850
24.9 percent of the vote

947
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:34,770
right on time

948
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:41,270
Distraction jump king pod racer. No, that's not correct. I blew it. Uh distraction jump king

949
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:44,229
Pod racer was right below it

950
01:25:45,539 --> 01:25:50,180
Distraction jump king was at 24 percent pod racer was at 22.5 percent

951
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:59,859
There you go. That was very very close closest one all night. It was lala land

952
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,760
I'm, not looking forward to these categories coming up

953
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:13,239
Because these when now we're getting into embarrassing territory like we haven't already apparently we haven't already

954
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:19,800
I like to do impressions off the cuff. Sometimes they're good. Sometimes they're bad

955
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,520
Uh, most of the times they're bad

956
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:26,279
The hair was pretty embarrassing. You're right. Uh, most of the time they're very bad

957
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:28,789
um

958
01:26:28,789 --> 01:26:31,989
This is another one of those categories where there's two of them for some reason

959
01:26:33,489 --> 01:26:35,489
worst impression and best impression

960
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:44,420
Another interchangeable list and some of these nominees don't did you no you didn't okay. Yeah, you i'm good

961
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:49,539
Uh, a lot of these nominees just kind of people nominated I think just to just to be funny

962
01:26:50,659 --> 01:26:54,659
One of one of these nominees in particular and we went through and we were like, all right. This was this was nominated

963
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,699
This was nominated like six times

964
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:03,300
So we yeah, we have to put it in we can't just like leave it out, but it's not it's it's barely anything

965
01:27:03,939 --> 01:27:09,539
You'll see the nominees for worst impression of the year whether of a video game character a celebrity

966
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:14,529
or a

967
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:20,260
That's not there's no other impressions. There you go. Worst impression of the year the nominees are

968
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:36,470
Hey

969
01:27:37,939 --> 01:27:43,380
Okay, hey, oh boy, I need a uh, I need to get myself some ice cream and some extra cola

970
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:49,859
Hire me i'm available. I am available. He's gonna rage a lot this stream. Why the simpsons?

971
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:55,539
How can you get mad at homer simpson seeing all these toys makes me wish I was a kid again

972
01:27:55,939 --> 01:28:00,659
If it's any consolation, I still think of you as a child. Thanks. I wish the court

973
01:28:10,449 --> 01:28:17,140
Shot I do that. I love how they have the combine voice that like

974
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:22,260
Like that was just delete that whole clip it was not even worth watching

975
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:28,069
Dude, what's the best peter griffin impression? You got it. Hey, uh, no

976
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:34,760
Why don't wait did I just do I have to walk behind the counter and make the change goofy?

977
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,529

01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:49,880
Well, I don't know anything about mad donald that's okay goofy i'll take care of you

979
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,750
Hey, okay. It's your thing. I did all the time

01:28:57,810 --> 01:29:01,270
Oh, you're all about sex aren't you quagmire?

981
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:13,050
Yeah

982
01:29:14,409 --> 01:29:23,590
All right, let's go gonna jump oh I can't wait to fight

983
01:29:31,109 --> 01:29:33,109
No, I can't it's too early

984
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:44,100
I don't know how it's possible that this this one last year

985
01:29:44,739 --> 01:29:47,539
This one whatever who cares this one leg

986
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,560
It's donald duck donald fucking duck

987
01:29:54,520 --> 01:30:01,960
17.8 percent of the vote donald duck won last year for worst impression. I just thought just I should just not do donald duck anymore

988
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,140
I'll just i'm never gonna I will never do donald duck ever again

989
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:08,619
I'll never try

990
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:12,550
Take a quick wine break

991
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:15,850
Try try it now try it now. All right

992
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:39,539
Fucking it's it's 2019 still fuck you donald duck was 17.8 percent by the way

993
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:43,050
This was very close

994
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:46,649
Canadian homer simpson was at 16.7 percent of the vote

995
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:56,819
17.8 for donald and 16.7 for homer simpson. It was all awful. There's two peter griffins

996
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:04,979
Just like the bad ones. There are also some good ones. I do have at least

997
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:10,739
Like half a tank of talent. Okay, i'm not gonna say i got a full tank of talent

998
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:14,010
I got a half a tank of talent

999
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:17,479
Look, you gotta know what you have

1000
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:19,479
Best impression of the year coming up

01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,829
Here are the nominees get off the screen

01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:42,520
I see some of you guys in this chat with your moms going

01:31:46,659 --> 01:31:52,100
You bit your controller because you lost one of these missions like 15 times in a row. I know it jerma

1004
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,420
How is it possible that you could be this bad?

1005
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,600
It's it's joe rivers

1006
01:32:09,319 --> 01:32:10,819
Oh children

1007
01:32:10,819 --> 01:32:15,000
Absolutely, it's unbelievable. Oh darling. You look so beautiful right now on the runway

1008
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:18,279
Let me tell you something about just how I forgot about the fuck

1009
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,039
I forgot fucking let's go. I can't fix it. I think I have this voice forever. I have this voice forever

1010
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:28,680
I did I fucked it up. I coughed too much and now it's over. I actually have this voice forever

1011
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,720
This is it. My career is over

1012
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:38,890
you know, that's that's why this game is so difficult actually now that I think about it because

1013
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:47,130
If you it's like triangle triangle triangle triangle l right that's easy triangle triangle triangle l but the way that he talks

1014
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:52,649
No, I know what we stop the target. It's just uh, it's not doesn't add up for my brain

1015
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:57,289
Jerma, can you pretend to be elmo thanos for the rest of the stream?

1016
01:33:14,739 --> 01:33:16,739
Reality is already

1017
01:33:17,539 --> 01:33:26,060
Mr. Noodle reality is often disappointing. Mr. Noodle. That's all you get

1018
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:31,420
All right, what if we can do a bit of gallop impression, uh wins the contest. Okay, uh go

1019
01:33:35,659 --> 01:33:38,470
Go your turn go go go

1020
01:33:45,979 --> 01:33:49,420
It's gonna be a post post human post human poggles i'm telling you post human

1021
01:33:51,939 --> 01:33:57,859
What's gonna happen is the seaman are gonna come up here and they're that's where

1022
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:04,579
Seaman are gonna come up and they are gonna totally just absolutely wipe us out and they're the globalists

1023
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:09,140
We're gonna take over with the seaman and then it goes real high. It goes real high joe

1024
01:34:10,699 --> 01:34:12,699
sorting algorithm noise

1025
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,859
Oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about

1026
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:22,789
The things they yeah. Oh you're killing me. Yep

1027
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:38,619
Oh, I have to listen to it now then it goes like

1028
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:47,239
Oh, I have to hear it right now, let's go

1029
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:53,060
For 15 pm

1030
01:34:54,810 --> 01:35:02,949
Don't you think your mother has had enough aggravation carrying you in her belly for nine long months

1031
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:08,029
Stop being a freeloader and step out into the real world

1032
01:35:21,859 --> 01:35:24,659
Do it man, come on, okay, let's go

1033
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:35,850
I I cut that one off accidentally

1034
01:35:36,569 --> 01:35:41,479
Like I said, I have to take it out

1035
01:35:44,119 --> 01:36:07,659
The winner is best impression of the year. Why I don't what do you think thanos elmo?

1036
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:14,939
With 22.5 percent of the vote elmo was there last year too. How many times have I done elmo on this stream?

1037
01:36:20,069 --> 01:36:25,189
Elmo here's what I don't understand. Okay, let me give you I want to break down some data for you

1038
01:36:26,569 --> 01:36:27,770
so

1039
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:30,140
apparently

1040
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:36,460
One of the worst things I did as an impression for last year was torture me elmo that got

1041
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:41,449
Like 15 percent of the vote, but also thanos elmo

1042
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:45,529
won best impression

1043
01:36:45,529 --> 01:36:48,890
How could I be on two different categories? I don't understand

1044
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:53,350
Uh sorting algorithm was in second place followed by ed ed and eddie

1045
01:36:54,149 --> 01:36:56,149
Uh both at about 12 percent

1046
01:36:56,470 --> 01:37:01,340
respectively thanos elmo

1047
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:05,899
All right. Now we're getting into the real the real stuff here

1048
01:37:06,539 --> 01:37:09,180
Still plenty of categories to go still a lot of categories to go

1049
01:37:11,579 --> 01:37:15,720
Coming up next is

1050
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:20,649
We make a lot of jokes on this stream. First of all, some of them are better than others

1051
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:23,479
Some of them take a lot of time

1052
01:37:23,479 --> 01:37:25,880
And they either land or they don't

1053
01:37:27,659 --> 01:37:29,659
These are the nominees

1054
01:37:29,909 --> 01:37:34,550
For the worst joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up

1055
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:48,340
You good? Are you good ato?

1056
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:51,180
Yeah, he's good

1057
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:54,699
Uh, yeah, so this is the worst joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up

1058
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:57,659
whether that's finding clips and images or

1059
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:03,659
Getting sounds ready and then all right. It's been like 15 straight minutes. Let's try to make something funny happen and

1060
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:05,819
Didn't work out so well

1061
01:38:05,819 --> 01:38:10,090
Here are the nominees for worst joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up

1062
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:46,100
I'm here with my friends. I've got my friends here. We're all doctors here. This guy's taking up my fucking limelight

1063
01:38:51,819 --> 01:38:54,250
All right the nominees

1064
01:38:54,729 --> 01:38:55,529
for

1065
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:56,489
best

1066
01:38:56,489 --> 01:38:59,210
Joke taking more than five minutes to set up

1067
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,409
Does that be real?

1068
01:39:02,409 --> 01:39:06,569
But so how do I prepare for how do I do I prepare for this everyone be laughing your ass off, right?

1069
01:39:06,569 --> 01:39:09,289
Like I I want like I want only luls in the chat

1070
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:12,329
The cat is seriously up up in the tree

1071
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:19,930
I'm trying to find a way I put on swimmies right to try to climb the tree better to think maybe there's gonna be grip

1072
01:39:21,689 --> 01:39:23,130
I know it's crazy

1073
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:25,050
Wait, did we get a raid?

1074
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:30,489
Hold on. I'm in the middle telling this crazy crazy story that happened to me when I was like fucking 19

1075
01:39:32,489 --> 01:39:34,489
Hey, hey edna

1076
01:39:34,649 --> 01:39:36,649
Okay, does the tv work yet?

1077
01:39:37,609 --> 01:39:40,010
Maybe just adjust it a little to the left

1078
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:42,250
Say hello

1079
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:44,250
Teleport to the tractor sleep for a week

1080
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:50,729
Teleport to the truck say hello teleport to the tractor sleep for a week until it's all until I marry this person

1081
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:57,130
This is bullshit and i'll tell you why I don't think anybody's played this game. We're seeing this

1082
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:04,890
There's no way since one game hour is about five minutes. That means 12 hours in game. You can talk to the ladies. Wait, what?

1083
01:40:05,609 --> 01:40:08,729
You can only complement them once per real hour

1084
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:22,539
Of the youngest one

1085
01:40:31,989 --> 01:40:36,949
There's so much science as to what the heck is this even is it energy is it a time paradox

1086
01:40:37,829 --> 01:40:42,310
Is it aliens? Did aliens make this? I don't know. It's so many questions that I have

1087
01:40:42,949 --> 01:41:14,810
We'll never know the answers to so before I real the real before I reveal the winner of this category

1088
01:41:15,609 --> 01:41:17,609
I have to make something very very clear

1089
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:24,300
Sometimes you spend some money and time and resources and you you think something's a really great idea

1090
01:41:25,899 --> 01:41:26,699
and

1091
01:41:26,699 --> 01:41:28,939
Fucking rumor get the fuck out of here

1092
01:41:29,989 --> 01:41:34,550
Uh, sometimes you have some ideas that don't play out so well, even when even if you hope they do

1093
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:40,720
and with

1094
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,720
39 percent of the vote

1095
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:45,770
by a majority

1096
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:49,050
And this fucking kind of annoys me in a way and i'll tell you why

1097
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,260
Bugleberry making pottery with almost 40 percent of the vote

1098
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:09,670
Now here's where this is bad and this is why this sucks the most for me

1099
01:42:11,289 --> 01:42:13,449
because

1100
01:42:13,449 --> 01:42:17,369
I had to take pottery classes to learn how to do that

1101
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:22,090
You notice how I knew what the fuck I was doing

1102
01:42:22,489 --> 01:42:27,640
I went to pottery class

1103
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:29,640
To like know how to do that

1104
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:33,829
And it turns out it was the worst thing I did all year

1105
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:44,500
It's okay. Hey look like I said as if you play baseball if you're a baseball player and you strike out seven times

1106
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:49,380
As long as you hit three home runs, you're one of the best players in baseball

1107
01:42:54,579 --> 01:43:04,859
That's a 300 average that took five days to set up took more than that. That was more than five minutes. That was uh,

1108
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,500
like three weeks

1109
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:14,760
Of learning how to do pottery and then setting up all the but that I love that stream. That's like I love that stream

1110
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:16,600
That's that's by the way

1111
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,680
That stream is nominated for best stream of the year. So

1112
01:43:19,479 --> 01:43:21,560
Look, you can have a bad part of one good stream

1113
01:43:23,479 --> 01:43:29,319
And I know everybody fucking hates bugleberry bugleberry won worst character last year. He ain't going anywhere

1114
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:32,140
He ain't going anywhere. He's gonna be the next big event

1115
01:43:33,210 --> 01:43:38,409
He ain't ever fucking going anywhere. I mean he's gonna be at every single event and I will those of you that it might be

1116
01:43:38,489 --> 01:43:40,579
New to the channel

1117
01:43:40,579 --> 01:43:44,579
When I did that segment with bugleberry, I think we had 8 000 concurrent viewers, right?

1118
01:43:45,699 --> 01:43:48,100
The second that bugleberry came on stream

1119
01:43:48,899 --> 01:43:50,899
We dropped I believe

1120
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,619
3000 viewers

1121
01:43:53,619 --> 01:43:58,579
We went from 8 000 concurrent down to like 5000 concurrent instantly

1122
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:03,659
I don't even give a shit. He's coming back

1123
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:10,890
Just like there are bad jokes that take more than five minutes to set up. There are also good ones apparently

1124
01:44:11,609 --> 01:44:13,609
Here is the nominee category

1125
01:44:14,619 --> 01:44:17,579
For best joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up

1126
01:44:20,039 --> 01:44:28,840
We'll see

1127
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,840
Oh, it's beautiful jack

1128
01:44:31,819 --> 01:44:40,520
It sure is

1129
01:44:41,159 --> 01:44:43,159
Oh, it's beautiful. I know

1130
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:51,060
Oh

1131
01:44:53,079 --> 01:44:55,079
Oh my fucking god

1132
01:44:56,819 --> 01:45:01,939
I've got it. You're that pit boss from the toy is he wearing lipstick. I smell a conspiracy

1133
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:07,380
You smell a nosy dog who's going to get smacked if he don't stop asking questions

1134
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:18,630
Fucking set on the package that wasn't gonna come off

1135
01:45:21,659 --> 01:45:27,420
Bro, I can't this is an acting. Okay, this is this is an acting class

1136
01:45:27,979 --> 01:45:31,100
You want to learn how to act and you want to learn how to compose yourself during a scene?

1137
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:33,819
They should do this in workshops. I should run a workshop and do this

1138
01:45:49,260 --> 01:46:06,869
And again, but sometimes the right one for you

1139
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:13,960
It's not working

1140
01:46:14,039 --> 01:46:18,680
It's not working. I just like ate like I just ate like a person

1141
01:46:19,479 --> 01:46:21,479
I wouldn't I eat right here?

1142
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,800
Get off. What do you guys want to do?

1143
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:28,920
I can I can barely do anything. I I really don't want to lie to you guys

1144
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:34,359
But I seriously fucking can't do shit right now story three was really good somebody asked in the chat

1145
01:46:34,439 --> 01:46:36,439
Let's make sure that I got I answered it

1146
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:45,590
Story four was okay, too. I didn't I didn't I I liked it

1147
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:14,810
Okay, i'm not i'm not even kidding on january 23rd i'm gonna like final destination movie my house

1148
01:47:15,369 --> 01:47:16,649
I'm serious

1149
01:47:16,649 --> 01:47:18,649
I just fucked myself three minutes

1150
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:24,859
Right here i'm gonna lie just lie down

1151
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:34,250
I was relaxing

1152
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:37,340
Here's the thing kids

1153
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:42,739
When you buy used games make sure very very important kids

1154
01:47:43,779 --> 01:47:48,739
Always under every circumstance make sure that you get exactly what you paid for in that box

1155
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:52,819
Because if it doesn't come in there you end up in a scenario like this

1156
01:47:52,819 --> 01:47:54,819
Yes

1157
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:57,460
And he doesn't have the other yes

1158
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:43,300
I hope that one wins. That was that what a great game. It's close. It was close

1159
01:48:54,439 --> 01:48:56,760
Farting and screaming playlist at the gym

1160
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:03,100
With 29.4 percent of the vote

1161
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,760
Uh very closely followed by germa dies

1162
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,880
At 20.9 percent

1163
01:49:12,569 --> 01:49:14,229

I went over on like a rant about like i'm fucking really sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't mean to

1221
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:23,460
It was real close

1222
01:56:23,539 --> 01:56:31,369

1228
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:17,060

01:57:33,159 --> 01:57:38,840
And it's the worst because I have this wooden panel on the ground so I can roll back and forth like this

1235
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:40,840
It's on a carpet here

1236
01:57:44,739 --> 01:57:48,819

01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,520
one of the worst jokes of the year

1242
01:58:08,819 --> 01:58:13,140
How bad was that? Let me see that shit. That's 10 000 fucking people watching and I fell back on my chair

01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:49,539
Coming up next is best noise of 2019. Who knows if they could be in the same category who cares?

1249
01:58:55,159 --> 01:58:59,109

1250
01:58:59,189 --> 01:59:01,189

It's like the most viewers we've had in like fucking three months

1255
01:59:22,979 --> 01:59:27,250
And I literally fall down

1256
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:30,449

It's I'm not by the way. I want to make this really fucking clear. That is

1262
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:56,979
No, you can't nominate that for anything because it's it's

1263
01:59:57,939 --> 02:00:00,659
Nine ten eleven. Wait, hold on

No

1274
02:01:29,010 --> 02:01:36,449
It's not resonable to call of duty modern warfare for best strategy game

1275
02:01:36,449 --> 02:01:40,449
Focused on those nominees are 10 years

1276
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:46,210

And if it weren't for nosy characters like you

1284
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,880
We practically own this world

1285
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:28,739
So, let's see you deal with this

1286
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:47,399

02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:36,800
the best noise of the year the slap

1291
02:03:38,319 --> 02:03:39,819
at

1292
02:03:39,819 --> 02:03:41,819
43.4 percent of the vote

1293
02:03:44,069 --> 02:03:48,949
Not only the best noise of the year, but the probably the worst thing i've ever done to myself on stream

1294
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:52,159
There's no way I can

1295
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:54,079
Explain that clip

1296
02:03:54,079 --> 02:03:59,039
There's no I can't explain it

1297
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:03,920
I told you i've seen threads on like reddit and shit where people are like he fucking did that on purpose

1298
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:06,880
To make to like what do you mean? I I I fail

1299
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,840
Fuck that's the new slap

1300
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:16,079
Like people say like dude, he fucking did it on purpose. He hit him. He slapped himself in the face to get like views

1301
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:22,579
I didn't and like whatever I I like I said before I probably should just own it and say that I did it on purpose

1302
02:04:23,539 --> 02:04:29,279
Because how do you explain that like oh I was looking at like the fucking preview monitor and trying to cue up a sound

1303
02:04:29,359 --> 02:04:32,399
You can't there's no I can't look that had to be on purpose

1304
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:42,260
slap past the torch to the I I I fall

1305
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:57,720
God damn it and I look in the camera too when I fall

1306
02:04:59,810 --> 02:05:03,409
Like it had to be on purpose. It had that had to be on purpose

1307
02:05:08,369 --> 02:05:13,119
Coming up next coming up next. Uh, who?

1308
02:05:14,319 --> 02:05:17,060
Is uh, this one had a shitload of nominations

1309
02:05:19,909 --> 02:05:21,890
best scare of the year

1310
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:27,250
Whether I was scared by something in game or scared by a video or scared by a jump scare best scare of the year

1311
02:05:29,649 --> 02:05:33,489
That's the new slap good. I'm glad it replaces once a year. We'll replace it with something else

1312
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:43,510
Uh best scare of the year coming up jump scares any scares, you know, you know the deal that's not correct

1313
02:05:52,289 --> 02:06:19,619
He's allowed by the way

1314
02:06:21,859 --> 02:06:23,859
What the fuck it's that guy, you know, it's not

1315
02:06:25,810 --> 02:06:28,439
What a fucking idiot I am

1316
02:06:28,439 --> 02:06:30,439
Get away, please

1317
02:06:30,439 --> 02:06:32,439
I thought it was the fucking guy with the hat on

1318
02:06:33,779 --> 02:06:38,340
Oh my god, that would have been the war out that would have been one of the scariest things ever in a video game

1319
02:06:38,899 --> 02:06:41,220
It still kind of was and i'm gonna die. I need to heal

1320
02:06:41,779 --> 02:06:50,600
It's jack surprise

1321
02:06:51,319 --> 02:06:54,000
Is that code for how I have to?

1322
02:07:02,930 --> 02:07:17,010
Oh my fucking jaw hurts I can't get in the back room. What do you think you're doing?

1323
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:23,319
That was uh, nothing just keep your fingers to yourself

1324
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:29,979
Okay, bye there's a little one hanging out somewhere

1325
02:07:36,789 --> 02:07:39,539
God damn it

1326
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:45,590
That's just that's the fucking worst thing that ever happened to me in a game

1327
02:07:46,229 --> 02:07:51,430
Without a doubt. That's the scariest because I know I have zero health and there's like 30 minutes of

1328
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:58,949
That was really really really real that was real that's because that's what would happen if a monster tried to kill me in real life

1329
02:07:59,510 --> 02:08:03,350
I can't believe it. I can't believe it

1330
02:08:17,409 --> 02:08:21,409
I spawned in here as well. You've got to be fucking shitting me sir

1331
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:32,130
Okay, well that was fun dad the party the fucking scary people nice music

02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:35,010
With jets on your hands

1333
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:47,880
Oh boy, I need to sit down I think I have to sit down for this

1334
02:09:11,189 --> 02:09:17,460
Suck my fucking bum

1335
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:41,090
And facing this way long

1336
02:09:57,560 --> 02:10:15,130
What are you doing isolation ward key run

1337
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:21,250
Oh

1338
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:08,359
The best scare of the year

1340
02:11:29,810 --> 02:11:34,369
Uh, the vr scare just took it. It was 43 44 percent of the vote

1341
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:40,210
It crushed it that I I thought I was gonna die. I really thought I was gonna die

1342
02:11:40,930 --> 02:11:46,579
Because when you're in vr, you have no perception of anything around you

1343
02:11:49,539 --> 02:11:57,250
And when you feel physical violence on you, you're just like i'm dead. I'm fucking dead in real life

1344
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:06,319
Six minutes until new year's we got plenty of categories everybody calm down with eight

1345
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:10,800
Yeah, it's we got like six minutes we got another category to do just relax

1346
02:12:11,279 --> 02:12:13,279
How much more wine do I have?

02:12:13,279 --> 02:12:15,279
Did I drink this much wine already?

1348
02:12:17,989 --> 02:12:32,069

1349
02:12:32,069 --> 02:12:35,189

1356
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,920

1359
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:20,390
um

1360
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:31,670
The first like 15 hours of the thing is okay, but you did it because of money. That's not even true

1361
02:13:32,229 --> 02:13:34,229
not even true, uh, but

1362
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:37,720
In that game the save points

1363
02:13:38,770 --> 02:13:44,449
I had one hp and I played that same fucking routine over and over and over again

1364
02:13:45,939 --> 02:13:52,260
If I died by that little monster, I would have had to come back and play 40 minutes of the game again

1365
02:13:53,199 --> 02:13:54,800
Oh would have been horrible

1366
02:13:54,800 --> 02:14:10,279
People are spamming a link. I don't even look like this

1368
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:25,539

Digging right down into the ground. What the fuck was that?

Were at 20.9 percent and 20.7 percent respectively. It was close

1532
02:33:36,450 --> 02:33:42,450
Uh playing just dance apparently is more impressive than beating the shinobi hunter in fucking first try with no damage

1533
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:52,790
All right

1534
02:33:52,790 --> 02:33:54,790

1538
02:34:08,389 --> 02:34:09,879

Sometimes I lose my mind sometimes I have problems on stream. Sometimes I get a little too upset

1542
02:34:22,469 --> 02:34:24,469
Sometimes I go too far

1543
02:34:26,719 --> 02:34:28,479
These are the nominees

1544
02:34:28,479 --> 02:34:30,479
for the worst meltdown

1545
02:34:30,639 --> 02:34:33,239
in 2019

1546
02:34:33,239 --> 02:34:35,639
Meltdown means very mad very upset

1547
02:34:37,250 --> 02:34:39,729
Just like actually want to turn my stream off

1548
02:34:40,950 --> 02:34:42,549

Where is he?

1559
02:35:54,200 --> 02:36:00,930
Bart, I don't understand how that's possible. I'm doing that the fastest anyone's ever done this

1560
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:04,719
Oh

1561
02:36:04,719 --> 02:36:06,879
You can't win. You can't it's not possible to win. You can't win

1562
02:36:09,350 --> 02:36:12,290

Get out of my way

1565
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:29,520
What the fuck is going on

1566
02:36:30,079 --> 02:36:34,040

1567
02:36:34,040 --> 02:36:37,680
Right. She doesn't understand the word right now

1568
02:36:38,319 --> 02:36:46,200
I'm watching a fucking youtube video at the end of this game. This is dumb. This is D U M B

1569
02:36:47,649 --> 02:36:48,930
dumb

1570
02:36:48,930 --> 02:36:54,799
Okay, can I please just get this jump before I start to have a little bit of a problem?

1571
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:57,280

Okay, okay, okay

1573
02:37:04,399 --> 02:37:10,719
Video games suck video games suck video games suck video games suck all video games. None of them are fun

1574
02:37:10,799 --> 02:37:14,719
All of them suck all video games suck. I've never played a video game ever again

1575
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:17,600
Did I make it?

1576
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:19,620
Did I make it?

1577
02:37:19,620 --> 02:37:23,520
Do I drive the car over this way?

1578
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:28,639
Did I make it?

1579
02:37:31,959 --> 02:37:33,959
Again

1580
02:37:34,200 --> 02:37:36,200

02:37:57,780 --> 02:38:02,709
Fucking display every machine your chances increase

1584
02:38:05,729 --> 02:38:06,690
Oh

1585
02:38:06,690 --> 02:38:08,690
What the fuck happened?

1586
02:38:08,770 --> 02:38:13,329
No, the first person camera was not in the right spot and it was one hit what?

1587
02:38:15,729 --> 02:38:17,729
What the fuck was that

1588
02:38:22,690 --> 02:38:29,700
No way I just like wasn't in the right spot you've got to be kidding me that was dumb

1589
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:35,719
Oh, no, I hate it

1590
02:38:41,360 --> 02:38:45,680
Whole thing has to be ice the whole course

1591
02:38:47,409 --> 02:38:51,969
Sonic racers didn't even have this shit mario kart doesn't even have a level like this

1592
02:38:53,030 --> 02:38:55,030
across the entire like

1593
02:38:55,090 --> 02:38:57,090
16 mario kart game

1594
02:39:08,739 --> 02:39:12,319
Yeah, I got called out it's okay

1595
02:39:12,319 --> 02:39:13,360
Uh

1596
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:15,360
the worst meltdown of the year

1597
02:39:17,959 --> 02:39:19,729
Not even close

1598
02:39:19,729 --> 02:39:21,729
Another category that just blew everything out

1599
02:39:34,180 --> 02:39:36,340
simpsons hit and run

1600
02:39:36,340 --> 02:39:38,819
With fifty one point seven percent of the vote

1601
02:39:39,989 --> 02:39:41,430
That's a lot

1602
02:39:41,430 --> 02:39:43,110
That's a lot

1603
02:39:43,110 --> 02:39:46,440
That's one of the longest streams i've ever done

1604
02:39:47,569 --> 02:40:00,069
And I agree that's the most fucked up i've ever been on camera. That's that's like the most angry tired and annoyed i've been

1605
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:03,860
In probably five years

1606
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:11,649
Simpsons hit and run was the worst meltdown by far if you want to know the uh runners up sure we can do that

1607
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:16,819
The next one was jump king

1608
02:40:18,049 --> 02:40:22,659
And after that was the thing

1609
02:40:22,899 --> 02:40:26,899
Simpsons hit jump by the way jump king was fifteen point nine percent of the vote

1610
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:38,479
All right, we are at the final four categories and these are big ones. These are really big ones. These are huge

1611
02:40:40,559 --> 02:40:43,360
This next category

1612
02:40:43,360 --> 02:40:51,159
Is the worst stream of the whole fucking year the stream that was not even funny

1613
02:40:51,639 --> 02:40:56,040
That was a waste of fucking time that was like why did you turn it on in the first place?

1614
02:40:57,120 --> 02:41:05,780
The worst stream of the year. Yeah, get a better joke. You guys said this last year, too

1615
02:41:06,180 --> 02:41:11,940
Oh this one. This one's the fucking worst. You said that last year and look at i'll turn it out for you

1616
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:17,219
No, you said that last year ain't gonna happen this year. No 2019 2018 same damn fucking story

1617
02:41:20,870 --> 02:41:24,309
What was the worst stream of the year? I know what I think it is

1618
02:41:25,270 --> 02:41:33,299
But maybe you have a different maybe slightly different story. This is one of the big categories

1619
02:41:35,540 --> 02:41:41,620
You motherfuckers

1620
02:41:41,620 --> 02:41:45,299
This is the category of the what the worst

1621
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:48,260
stream

1622
02:41:48,260 --> 02:41:50,260
Of 2019

1623
02:41:52,180 --> 02:41:54,180
What is the worst stream of the year?

1624
02:41:54,180 --> 02:42:02,790
Here we go

1625
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:16,239
Fuck be so fucking mad right i'm so mad right now. Does anybody see jay? I don't know what to do

1626
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:18,799

1627
02:42:18,799 --> 02:42:25,700
What he didn't let squeak in sausage? You didn't like this? Do you want to do another fucking card game?

1628
02:42:26,260 --> 02:42:31,639
No, no, no anything but that do anything else. I don't want to see this again

1629
02:42:47,639 --> 02:42:49,639

1630
02:43:02,020 --> 02:43:06,979
He is he he's a normie I know you're gonna scream I know that I already told you you're gonna be mad

02:43:14,450 --> 02:43:18,209
Get out leave don't don't come to this stream. This stream is not a one you want to watch

1633
02:43:18,209 --> 02:43:21,090
But i'm not very good at this game and I look over here and I see

1634
02:43:22,049 --> 02:43:25,329
Like a wall of people fucking holding up notes

1635
02:43:26,129 --> 02:43:28,850
They stick it into the wall. Hey, look at this

1636
02:43:29,649 --> 02:43:31,649
But you have to do it like this quick

1637
02:43:31,889 --> 02:43:34,850
I know we're supposed to play halo reach on legendary difficulty

1638
02:43:35,409 --> 02:43:37,010
But what if we just this is what we're talking about

1639
02:43:37,010 --> 02:43:40,049
What if we just make the ground that we're walking on made out of bodies?

1640
02:43:41,329 --> 02:43:43,329
Show you a video

1641

Hey, yeah, you don't want to talk about reaching into the toilet like pulling up like drain pipes

1645
02:44:04,459 --> 02:44:10,540
Oh

1646
02:44:52,840 --> 02:44:56,500
The worst stream of the year

1647
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:58,500
of all of 2019

1648
02:45:12,649 --> 02:45:23,430
halo reach with joel

1649
02:45:23,430 --> 02:45:26,389
halo reach with joel with 30 percent of the vote

1650
02:45:28,950 --> 02:45:30,950
below that was

1651
02:45:31,190 --> 02:45:36,569
The hearthstone stream

1652
02:45:36,569 --> 02:45:38,649
I can agree with that

1653
02:45:38,649 --> 02:45:42,489
I think the worst stream of the year was the unlock card game stream

1654
02:45:44,420 --> 02:45:48,819
Try to do something different

1655
02:45:48,819 --> 02:45:54,139
It was so bad

1656
02:45:54,139 --> 02:45:56,139
That's the worst stream i've ever done

1657
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Regardless of what everybody says

1658
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:02,500
That's the worst stream i've ever done on this channel

1659
02:46:04,729 --> 02:46:06,170
call joel

1660
02:46:06,170 --> 02:46:08,489

robot carnival

1704
02:52:04,719 --> 02:52:10,840
There it is best stream of the year. Apparently we're at the end of the night here

1705
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:17,479
We have a couple more categories to do two very do very important categories

1706
02:52:21,469 --> 02:52:26,219
Because i've been doing this for such a long time. We have

1707
02:52:29,100 --> 02:52:31,100
the worst joke of the decade

1708
02:52:32,729 --> 02:52:37,770
And the best joke of the decade I did youtube

1709
02:52:38,670 --> 02:52:40,670
Six years or so before I did twitch

1710
02:52:43,280 --> 02:52:51,049
Those are included twitch is just about 40 to 50 percent of the whole time. I spent on these platforms

1711
02:52:53,049 --> 02:53:01,370
He was a tuber. So these hold a very special place in my heart. They really do even the worst ones even the shittiest

02:53:02,010 --> 02:53:04,829
joke of the whole decade

Comprehend this eleven thousand five hundred fucking people here. There's a lot of people

1716
02:53:19,420 --> 02:53:24,700
I've i'm shocked that there's this many people that think this stream is worth being a part of

1717
02:53:26,479 --> 02:53:34,440
Or the youtube channel from 10 years ago. So from the bottom of regardless of what wins worst joke and best joke of the decade

2083
03:27:34,020 --> 03:27:38,020
I'm not sure where but they probably are this probably a bot pulling images

2084
03:27:38,579 --> 03:27:45,360
From either twitter or discord if you put an image that said this is stolen artwork. Do not buy report it

2085
03:27:46,319 --> 03:27:52,159
They'd probably put it up on the shop. That's true. Yeah, that's true

2086
03:27:56,049 --> 03:27:58,209
Hey morning maple. Thanks to 500 bits

2087
03:27:58,209 --> 03:28:03,569
This is like a red bubble version of the daffy duck skit where he's fighting against the animator

2088
03:28:04,500 --> 03:28:08,370
Yeah, this is real life

2089
03:28:08,370 --> 03:28:12,610
You didn't thank elliot mills for their countless stolen fucking assets

2090
03:28:13,170 --> 03:28:15,899
I know what's wrong with me. Why wouldn't I do that?

03:29:38,340 --> 03:29:42,979
The dude who did old town road you boomer. I can't fucking believe that

2105
03:29:46,540 --> 03:29:49,260
That's ridiculous. I seriously can't believe it

2106
03:29:57,420 --> 03:30:05,229
He's probably watching. Well, thank you little naz. I i'm shocked. Thank you old town rats

2107
03:30:05,709 --> 03:30:06,909
Yeah

2108
03:30:06,909 --> 03:30:12,049
Don't forget us when you're famous. How could I ever forget you guys?

2109
03:30:14,290 --> 03:30:16,610
You got me here in the first place. You serious?

2110
03:30:21,489 --> 03:30:24,370
And plus it was just a little fun tweet. It's not a big deal

2111
03:30:25,010 --> 03:30:32,540
Not a big deal. Also

2112
03:30:33,389 --> 03:30:35,069
Uh-oh, I lost my place

2113
03:30:35,069 --> 03:30:42,909
Where am I? Where the fuck am I? How did I lose my place? What?

2114
03:30:44,860 --> 03:30:46,540
Oh, there we are

2115
03:30:46,540 --> 03:30:52,379
Vilemi, thanks for the thousand bits Vilemi. I'm glad at least the chat agrees that the doctors were the best joke of the year

2116
03:30:53,729 --> 03:30:55,809
Well, it was nominated for worst joke of the year. So

2117
03:30:57,069 --> 03:31:03,420
Bad news for you bala koala. Thanks for the 1500 bits 15 dollars

2118
03:31:03,979 --> 03:31:06,420
German just want to say thanks for the last year

2119
03:31:06,819 --> 03:31:09,780
You and your community did a lot for me in the past 365 days

2120
03:31:10,420 --> 03:31:12,020
Just want to say thanks

2121
03:31:12,020 --> 03:31:15,940
Wish I could give more money, but my job fell through and i'm back to contract work

2122
03:31:16,659 --> 03:31:19,860
So I gotta be a bit more conservative with my money than i'd like

2123
03:31:20,659 --> 03:31:27,489
Anyways, excuse my rambling. I've been celebrating the new year. Just want to say thanks never under any circumstance ever

2124
03:31:28,049 --> 03:31:33,170
Feel obligated to give this channel money for any reason ever ever for any fucking reason ever

2125
03:31:36,110 --> 03:31:38,030
You being here and watching

2126
03:31:38,030 --> 03:31:41,979
Is enough for me. Thank you. Seriously. Thanks a lot

2127
03:31:43,940 --> 03:31:51,579
No one is under any obligation to pay this channel money. Tell that to the people that gifted 2020 subs

2128
03:31:53,579 --> 03:31:55,340
It was a lot

2129
03:31:55,340 --> 03:32:09,020
It was a lot, but no one's ever supposed to do that. I hope you know that we are encroaching on 10k subs now and

2130
03:32:11,520 --> 03:32:18,479
None of you have to do that, but you do a lot of you do

2131
03:32:19,120 --> 03:32:22,700
I said it three or four times

2132
03:32:22,700 --> 03:32:28,579
I hope you think it's worth it. I really fucking hope you think it's worth doing

2133
03:32:32,020 --> 03:32:38,049
Seriously, I don't want you to give subs to this channel and look back and be like, ah, that was fucking stupid

2134
03:32:38,129 --> 03:32:57,020
What a dumb idea. I hope you think it's worth it. Thank you morning maple. Thanks for 300 bits

2135
03:32:57,020 --> 03:33:02,639
The pottery was good bugleberry wasn't damn it. That's that's real. It's a real statement

2136
03:33:04,420 --> 03:33:09,059
Peaceful hailey, thanks for the 550 bits. Happy new year germa. Hope 2019 was good for you

2137
03:33:09,700 --> 03:33:13,200
Just want to say that you win the category of best streamer of the decade in my heart

2138
03:33:13,200 --> 03:33:15,360
You do so much for this community

2139
03:33:15,360 --> 03:33:18,979
The fact that you took pottery lessons for a bit is so much dedication

2140
03:33:20,319 --> 03:33:22,260
Most streamers wouldn't do that

2141
03:33:22,260 --> 03:33:25,620
You're an amazing funny person. Anyways, hope 2020 is the best it can be for you

2142
03:33:26,819 --> 03:33:34,989
Keep up the dedication. I will this stuff in the works right now that is gonna take months

2143
03:33:36,319 --> 03:33:38,879
But hopefully he's worth it

2144
03:33:38,879 --> 03:33:43,170
I think it will be we'll see

2145
03:33:44,579 --> 03:33:52,209
Thank you hailey reaper. Thanks for the 250. Hey germa. When are you gonna admit that bugleberry is terrible?

2146
03:33:52,850 --> 03:33:58,180

The true michi. Thanks for the thousand bits

2470
04:00:00,379 --> 04:00:02,620
You know, I still remember when I first got on the stream

2471
04:00:04,719 --> 04:00:07,680
Uh chicky told me to visit him and we watched your stream together

2472
04:00:08,239 --> 04:00:42,989
I had such a blast with him

2473
04:00:43,389 --> 04:00:49,790
And since he's gone

2474
04:00:50,590 --> 04:01:09,500
Uh, I don't know since he's away. I keep sticking around here from time to time

2475
04:01:11,309 --> 04:01:14,350
And you put a damn smile on my sad face every time

2476
04:01:14,909 --> 04:01:16,430
So thank you

2477
04:01:16,430 --> 04:01:18,510
For everything man. Thank you so much for talking to him

2478
04:01:19,489 --> 04:01:21,489
And I thank you for being amazing

2479
04:01:23,899 --> 04:01:25,440
uh

2480
04:01:25,440 --> 04:01:27,579
Those who don't know

2481
04:01:27,579 --> 04:01:31,100
I haven't i've never talked about it because there's no there's no reason to

2482
04:01:32,479 --> 04:01:34,799
uh

2483
04:01:34,799 --> 04:01:36,799
And there's no reason to talk about it now

2484
04:01:37,940 --> 04:01:42,020
but there was somebody in the community that um was going through a lot of shit and had

2485
04:01:43,139 --> 04:01:45,139
brain cancer and

2486
04:01:45,139 --> 04:01:49,360
I hung out with them a few times and

2487
04:01:51,520 --> 04:01:54,000
They were really really awesome. They were really good person

2488
04:01:55,680 --> 04:02:01,739
Uh, and there's no reason to even go any further than that. You know what I mean?

2489
04:02:06,399 --> 04:02:09,440
And some with somebody put me in contact and it was

2490
04:02:10,690 --> 04:02:13,010
It was really awesome to hear the things that they had to say

2491
04:02:14,209 --> 04:02:16,209
They were really fucking good person

2492
04:02:16,690 --> 04:02:30,370
And i'm really sad to know they're gone

2493
04:02:30,370 --> 04:02:31,329
so

2494
04:02:31,329 --> 04:02:33,889
Yeah, I mean this is this is this is a big deal for me

2495
04:02:34,610 --> 04:02:36,979
to

2496
04:02:36,979 --> 04:02:41,860
Michi, I think was one of the people that put me in contact with him in the first place and something i've never talked about on stream

2497
04:02:42,899 --> 04:02:44,340
uh, so

2498
04:02:44,340 --> 04:02:49,069
But for real much love to you much love to chicky

2499
04:02:51,729 --> 04:03:00,000
They were going through a lot

2500
04:03:00,000 --> 04:03:02,479
That hit me right that hit me right in the chest it did

2501
04:03:09,409 --> 04:03:19,010
Thank you michi for the thousand bits and for even even putting me in contact

2502
04:03:19,969 --> 04:03:26,299
In the first place was with with chicky much love to them as well and their family

2503
04:03:38,049 --> 04:03:40,370
You know, sometimes you get real right? Sometimes you get real

2504
04:03:41,090 --> 04:03:43,090
I'm not going to pretend like i'm going to put on some

2505
04:03:43,649 --> 04:03:45,090
show

2506
04:03:45,090 --> 04:03:56,829
100 of the time this is real shit. This is real shit

2507
04:03:58,260 --> 04:04:03,149
It is

2508
04:04:03,149 --> 04:04:05,629
I came here for laughs. Yeah, but it's it's

2509
04:04:07,040 --> 04:04:14,159
sometimes you got to be real and just knowing that

2510
04:04:15,709 --> 04:04:22,190
If I made somebody happy at all and I mean this we're talking about this is like a year ago more than that

2511
04:04:24,219 --> 04:04:28,860
Thank you michi. I really appreciate the fucking thoughts and I really appreciate you coming in the stream

2512
04:04:40,620 --> 04:04:46,420
oh

2513
04:04:46,420 --> 04:04:48,979
Because if people really like I said before i'm sorry

2514
04:04:48,979 --> 04:04:53,620
I just fucking punch you in the face if people really get something from the stream and it's part of them

2515
04:04:55,620 --> 04:04:58,180
you know that makes me fucking happy and like that's

2516
04:04:59,389 --> 04:05:02,829
What else could I ask for? What else could I possibly ask for?

2517
04:05:04,270 --> 04:05:10,670
Oh, thanks for the 15. No fuck you who cares about money, right? Like if you guys are happy they're good

2518
04:05:17,090 --> 04:05:19,090
but that that hits home because

2519
04:05:19,409 --> 04:05:27,680
It's just just something to think about

2520
04:05:35,979 --> 04:05:37,579
I don't get very

2521
04:05:37,579 --> 04:05:39,579
uh emotional on stream

2522
04:05:41,139 --> 04:05:43,139
But for stuff like that i'm going to

2523
04:05:44,540 --> 04:05:47,579
And i'm not i just i'm that's just the way it is

2524
04:05:52,620 --> 04:05:54,620
We made him cry

2525
04:05:54,700 --> 04:05:59,579
No, no, I got a little I got choked up and there's a good reason for it

2526
04:06:00,690 --> 04:06:03,309
But we can move on from that

2527
04:06:12,770 --> 04:06:14,770
Fuck you. You cried

2528
04:06:15,170 --> 04:06:16,770

2530
04:06:23,430 --> 04:06:30,920
You guys don't even know I fucking got choked up like two videos before I got choked up like two videos ago

2531
04:06:30,920 --> 04:06:35,079
I got news for you

2532
04:06:35,079 --> 04:06:37,079
Change your category to just crying

2533
04:06:44,979 --> 04:06:46,979
Everybody I just gotta tell you

2534
04:06:50,469 --> 04:06:56,309

04:06:59,829 --> 04:07:02,549
but seriously rest in peace to chicky and

2536
04:07:03,360 --> 04:07:05,360

2542
04:07:41,799 --> 04:07:46,280
It's insane seeing your viewer go from one to two k people now averaging four to five k

2543
04:07:47,000 --> 04:07:48,899
Keep it up

2544

Get it off, okay. Um, anyways, uh, that's

2626
04:14:42,479 --> 04:14:47,219
Over 10,000 subs on the channel. I don't I never thought I would ever see this

2627
04:14:48,120 --> 04:14:49,170

I think you should play the instrumental version of rats birthday mix tape for the rest of the bits

2645
04:16:20,389 --> 04:16:22,389
Uh, not the rest of the bits. Maybe a little bit

2646
04:16:23,030 --> 04:16:26,149

I was really isolating for me since i've been talking with her every day until that point

2828
04:32:04,040 --> 04:32:07,809
But your streams helped me tear me up and keep company during it

2829
04:32:08,049 --> 04:32:13,170
You're a huge inspiration the things you said in these post stream chats got me to return to college

2972
04:43:35,340 --> 04:43:42,080
Always love the content. We quote you on the daily 250 from genie boy. You're a genuinely funny guy, Jeremy

2973
04:43:42,240 --> 04:43:44,560
I'm usually serious and stone-faced around people

2974
04:43:45,310 --> 04:43:47,310
But after I met you in early 2017

2975
04:43:47,869 --> 04:43:51,069
And I watched you grab that auto five bit and followed you on twitch

2976
04:43:51,819 --> 04:43:57,099
I laugh more often as a famous actor once said a day without laughter is a day wasted

2977
04:44:00,139 --> 04:44:02,139
I would say that's about that much

2978
04:44:02,779 --> 04:44:04,779
How much you mean to me? Thank you from chile

2979
04:44:07,040 --> 04:44:09,580
2020 is the year of the rat. Thank you

2980
04:44:12,560 --> 04:44:17,840
Garfield thanks for the 250. Let's take another stroll down memory lane with gar remember that time

2981
04:44:17,919 --> 04:44:20,080
I single-handedly raised the bit minimum twice

2982
04:44:20,880 --> 04:44:21,680
Yes

2983
04:44:21,680 --> 04:44:25,119
It used to be 25 bits before garf stepped in the picture

2984
04:44:25,200 --> 04:44:27,919
I bet some of you new subs don't even know about that one

2985
04:44:28,619 --> 04:44:32,619
I don't know if i'm allowed to do this but since this is the last gar for graph of the decade

2986
04:44:33,409 --> 04:44:35,490
I guess it was worth a chart a shot

2987
04:44:40,720 --> 04:44:45,840
Garfield the monday killer is the reason why we have raised the minimum bits and here here you go here

2988
04:44:47,709 --> 04:44:50,909
It used to be a hundred actually and then garfield the monday killer

2989
04:44:51,810 --> 04:44:55,009
uh came along and

2990
04:44:55,009 --> 04:45:02,259
Gave a hundred and a lot and we had to increase the bits because it was uh, it was got one too long

2991
04:45:04,080 --> 04:45:10,220
But the monday killer strikes twice

2992
04:45:10,540 --> 04:45:18,060
Where's my keys 300 bits? Can I donate directly through twitch? I don't know. I don't have that available only through twitch or subs, unfortunately

2993
04:45:19,619 --> 04:45:25,220
Uh k decon or thanks for the five dollars jerma. I meant to give this to you for christmas, but it's a bit late here

2994
04:45:26,259 --> 04:45:28,259

2995
04:45:30,139 --> 04:45:37,119

2996
04:45:37,200 --> 04:45:39,259

3002
04:45:53,470 --> 04:45:59,150
Kim and I did a dna test on auto because I didn't know what he was

3003
04:46:00,400 --> 04:46:03,409
We finally got the results back

3004
04:46:03,409 --> 04:46:05,409
He is 38 percent

3005
04:46:06,099 --> 04:46:09,900
Doxin he is 38 percent

3006
04:46:10,540 --> 04:46:13,330
something else

3007
04:46:13,330 --> 04:46:15,330
He is 10 percent

3008
04:46:15,569 --> 04:46:18,240
Shetland sheepdog

3009
04:46:18,240 --> 04:46:26,900
He is 10 percent chihuahua. What do you think the 38 percent is? That's not doxin

3010
04:46:28,689 --> 04:46:30,930
It's ridiculous. I can't even make this up

3011
04:46:35,459 --> 04:46:42,180

04:46:56,930 --> 04:46:59,009
Only auto would be rat terrier, right?

3016
04:47:00,500 --> 04:47:01,700
