1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:20,010
Hello, my wonderful friends. Good afternoon. Hope you're having a good day. I'm just hanging out. I'm just having a good time.

2
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:32,659
There we go. Hey, why don't we change some music? Yeah, let's change the music a little bit today.

3
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:44,850
Those of you that weren't out here a couple days ago. This is the intro song to Monster Rancher 4. I don't know why.

4
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,840
What if this was just my intro?

5
00:00:50,840 --> 00:01:43,340
Stream's starting soon, guys. See you in a minute. I can kind of do it again. I thought my cough was kind of back. Remember I couldn't do that last week?

6
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:52,340
Hey, that's what you've been hearing. That's been the intro to Monster Rancher 4. We're going to continue where we left off.

7
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:05,340
We had three wonderful little babies that are starting to grow up into adults. And they're probably going to die really soon, so don't get too attached.

8
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:18,860
But yeah, I was out last night. I took Kim out. It was her birthday weekend, so we went out. It was her birthday weekend.

9
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,610
We ended up being able to take the same amount of time off because she works too. So we ended up being able to go out last night.

10
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:37,610
It was really fun. It was great. But the only problem is I have made my sickness come back. I'm coughing again, which sucks because I was just over it.

11
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,909
Well, what can you do? But I think I just caused it to come back for a minute.

12
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:03,620
I don't know. Something's going on. Something is going around. I probably got sick with something else. I'd be so pissed.

13
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,110
Sick forever. I just keep getting a different strand of the cold.

14
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,530
Anyways, let's go right where we left off. Welcome, everybody.

15
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,939
I've been sick since I swallowed the semen. I'm like, I know. That's fucked up.

16
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:34,990
I'm going to have to go to the doctor and be like, why have I been sick for like three weeks?

17
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:45,180
I never get sick like this. You guys know that. Maybe like once or twice, maybe once a year, I will get sick like this.

18
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:55,389
Like sort of like coughing and no, never. I have a bunch of other problems, but I never get sick.

19
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:14,759
It was your first winter in Vegas. That's true. It was the Mike and the raw pizza. Raw pizza.

20
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,500
As is Vroomer. I catch everybody up that wasn't paying attention last time.

21
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Maybe you fell asleep because of a retarded sleeper. Or maybe you were just not here.

22
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,500
These are our three monsters. We have Wally, Roberto, and Vroomer.

23
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:41,319
Vroomer is the best currently, but I think Roberto is going to be passing him very soon.

24
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:51,060
But Wally I think is on their way out. They're not very good. They're causing problems.

25
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,319
This thing sucks. I'll be honest. But its cute factor brings it to like an eight.

26
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,819
So its usefulness is like a four. But look at that dance.

27
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:11,740
We can try fusing Wally with somebody. How about this? This is what we're going to do.

28
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,709
We're going to say goodbye to Wally, but we're not going to say bye.

29
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:22,709
We're not going to say bye. We're going to say hello to their fresh DNA.

30
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:26,709
And we're going to fuse them with somebody else. Because we're going to put some more CDs in.

31
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:38,139
Give him...I'm a monster.

32
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,899
Let me...alright, here's what's going to happen.

33
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,899
Let me see...no, no, no, don't do that.

34
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:56,589
Let's take a look at the calendar. I didn't win in the D rank. I got cheesed by the enemy.

35
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:04,829
They resurrected twice. But I think you unlock more monsters when somebody gets up here.

36
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:09,829
So we were almost here, but I got screwed.

37
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,829
So unfortunately we got to go back and do that again.

38
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:16,829
That was kind of an annoying moment, but whatever.

39
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:21,649
For the time being, I think it's time.

40
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,240
It's time to freeze Wally.

41
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,240
We're going to have them forever.

42
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:40,300
Everyone's going to be very upset about this.

43
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,550
Just wait longer.

44
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,610
I kind of want to put in some more CDs.

45
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Let's be honest here.

46
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,779
I want to see a couple more CDs worth of monsters.

47
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:08,019
And Wally's just the weakest link out of the three of them. That's just the way it is.

48
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:15,000
High King Milk, 10 community subs.

49
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,500
What is it with Monster Rancher 4 and community subs right off the bat? 10.

50
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Thank you, High King Milk.

51
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:33,180
His intelligence is so high, but he just don't...

52
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:43,339
Let me take a look at this.

53
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,339
So this is 216, 199, 200.

54
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:49,639
But better moves.

55
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,639
This is 242, 139, 182.

56
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,639
Alright, maybe not.

57
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:02,029
Maybe if I just increase his accuracy, he'll be good.

58
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:11,649
Roberto just doesn't have high stats, but the moves, they hit so often and they're so good.

59
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,819
Maybe Vroomer. Vroomer sucks.

60
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,439
No, I've said that about all three of them. They're all good.

61
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:31,930
Look, Vroomer is almost a year and three months old.

62
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,169
And Roberto is about to pass them.

63
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,179
You understand?

64
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
D, he's not even one.

65
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,169
It might be time to put Vroomer on ice.

66
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,279
Alright, I'm going to give it a couple more weeks.

67
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:05,340
If Vroomer and Wally can prove in the next two or three weeks of training that they're worth keeping around, then I'll keep them.

68
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,649
I'm telling you, one or two of them are gone.

69
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,129
We can even combine them.

70
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,820
I could combine Vroomer with Roberto or Wally.

71
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,580
Alright, what have we got for schedule?

72
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:29,100
You know what? Fuck it.

73
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,279
I'm going to combine the two of them.

74
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,500
Let's go.

75
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Roberto is our ranked player.

76
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
We're just going to mess with DNA now.

77
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,789
Look, the game is saved, so if this sucks, I'll just save this comment.

78
00:09:51,659 --> 00:10:03,980
Goodbye, Vroomer.

79
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,289
See, he's happy.

80
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:12,289
Alright, now let's retire Wally and we're going to fuse them together.

81
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:15,980
We're going to get a nut on a wheel.

82
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,980
How do you guys not think that's cool?

83
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,980
I do.

84
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:28,279
It's cool, man.

85
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,279
You're going to get a pinwheel.

86
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,279
Alright, here we go.

87
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,960
Combine.

88
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Let's see.

89
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,970
We still have these idiots here.

90
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,940
Alright, Vroomer and Wally.

91
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
What happens?

92
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,039
Skunk Roller and Suzurecho.

93
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:01,889
Sprite.

94
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
The base stats are not really that good.

95
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:16,389
Skunk Roller.

96
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Wind Lore, Backspin.

97
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,750
It's just a wheel.

98
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,750
Attack and...

99
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:32,340
These both sound like Twitch emotes.

100
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,460
Let's do it.

101
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:40,149
Let's see what happens.

102
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:51,610
I'll save scumming.

103
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,610
Okay, well Vroomer just consumed.

104
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,019
That's just Vroomer.

105
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,019
It was unfrozen and ate the walnut and then just walked out.

106
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,700
No.

107
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:12,539
Vroomer and...

108
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Okay, what about High Intelligence?

109
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
What about Wonka and Wally?

110
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:27,340
Mush Tan.

111
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Pumpkey Plant.

112
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,059
Pumpkey Plant has actually pretty high...

113
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,059
Actually, Mush Tan does too.

114
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:40,279
Look at the health on Mush Tan.

115
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,940
That's not bad base stats.

116
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,940
Mush Tan.

117
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,259
Let's see, what do you look at?

118
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,529
It's a plant, right?

119
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:05,529
No.

120
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:07,529
We've seen it already.

121
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:09,529
I don't want this.

122
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,190
Oh my god.

123
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,059
I kind of have to keep this one.

124
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:39,610
How about Wally Wonka?

125
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,299
No.

126
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:47,299
Let's do Shroomer.

127
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
We already had a Shroomer.

128
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,700
How about like Prove It To Me?

129
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Yeah, that's a good name.

130
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,019
Prove It To Me.

131
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,220
Come on.

132
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Prove it to me.

133
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:23,659
Prove it to me.

134
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,730
That's worse than hashtag V.

135
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,210
Yeah, I know how to spell prove it, guys.

136
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:38,210
Look, it needs to fit in this tiny amount of characters that can fit here.

137
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:45,179
Prove it to me.

138
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:49,409
Prove to me.

139
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:51,970
No, that sucks.

140
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,970
That's worse than what I did.

141
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,919
Prover.

142
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,720
Let's see if they can prove it.

143
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:43,580
Let's get a couple of discs in here.

144
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,580
High base stats, though.

145
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,480
All right, Prover.

146
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
I need to go back.

147
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,659
We got Roberto.

148
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:54,659
Shrine.

149
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:58,470
Let's get some more discs in here.

150
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,759
Roberto is going to climb the ranks real fast, so don't worry about losing progress there.

151
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,759
All you really need is just one.

152
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Create.

153
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,129
All right, from a saucer.

154
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,620
What's going in?

155
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:28,950
I've got Dark Souls.

156
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,950
I don't even own Dark Souls.

157
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,950
The actual physical copy.

158
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,950
I don't think I own any of them.

159
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:36,259
How about Dynamite Cop?

160
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,259
Or Space Channel 5 is down here, too.

161
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:42,539
Let's put in Dynamite Cop.

162
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
Here, I'll prove it.

163
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,220
Hey, don't worry, I'll be a Prover.

164
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
How do I look today?

165
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,059
Probably bad.

166
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,019
No, not that bad.

167
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,019
Here, Dynamite Cop for the Dreamcast.

168
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,390
Going to insert CD into the disc tray.

169
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:21,009
After this, I'll put Red Box in after this.

170
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,349
It's going to be a Shroomer.

171
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:33,779
If it is, then I'm just going to accept fate and just wait until we unlock more.

172
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:40,480
And you get some really good McDonald's M hair today.

173
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:57,950
But I should just spray paint.

174
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,950
Or what's the spray color?

175
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,950
My hair?

176
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,579
Yellow in the front there.

177
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
All right, here we go.

178
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Oh, by the way, I have something to talk about.

179
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
I got approval from somebody at Twitch.

180
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,400
The Scratch Ticket charity stream is going to happen.

181
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Probably in the next couple days.

182
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
For the deaths in Sekiro.

183
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,019
Oh my fucking God, it's fate.

184
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,970
I'm just going to play.

185
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,970
Should I just take them both?

186
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:41,619
Let's try a different one.

187
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:43,619
Let's try Space Channel.

188
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,730
Give me a break.

189
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,730
Is it because they're Dreamcast and all Dreamcast games are the same game?

190
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,119
Well, this is not even a Dreamcast game, so that's fine.

191
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,119
Space Channel 5, this is the bootleg one, isn't it?

192
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,869
So, you know what I mean?

193
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,069
This is the bootleg one.

194
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,380
This is not even a Sega Dreamcast game.

195
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,380
This is somebody like burnt this on their fucking Windows 2000 computer.

196
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:30,859
Something.

197
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
Something that's not the mushroom guy.

198
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,759
I would be, it's going to be the mushroom, it's going to be Dreamcast.

199
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,759
Because all the Dreamcast games have the same internal seed or something.

200
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:52,059
I'm going to have to grab other disks that are not Dreamcast.

201
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:59,230
Okay.

202
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:12,099
Dreamcast used proprietary code.

203
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:14,660
So maybe it is.

204
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,660
Maybe they can't, maybe you can't pull data from Dreamcast.

205
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,250
Okay, come on.

206
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:40,650
The fungus is a catch-all for any disk that's too new.

207
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,279
I'm going to have to get some old shit.

208
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,279
I got some old shit here.

209
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:51,529
It's a meat rumor.

210
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,410
We just replaced this one.

211
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,410
We just replaced the rumor with meat rumor.

212
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,019
It's just Cheeto dusted rumor.

213
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:06,019
We already talked about this.

214
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:14,339
Upgraded.

215
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:19,460
No.

216
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
No, no, no.

217
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,099
I'm putting in Redbox.

218
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:27,099
Redbox is about to go in.

219
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:37,380
And then, like somebody said, you might as well just grind up to rank A.

220
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
I got a really good monster to grind up to rank A.

221
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,940
We're just going to just, we're steamrolling all the competitions.

222
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,730
Let's get this here.

223
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,609
Too new?

224
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,609
We'll just use standard DVDs and CDs and PS1, PS2 disks.

225
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:01,609
Copy protection doesn't affect those.

226
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:03,849
Interesting.

227
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,339
But here is, here's Redbox.

228
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
It's a great CD.

229
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:17,349
Redbox guy, come on.

230
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:20,549
Give us something here.

231
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,549
This is a regular, just CD, DVD.

232
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,549
It's not like a protected code from Dreamcast.

233
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Watch like Vinnie come in here and goes, oh, actually, we use like the protected code, man.

234
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
You're going to get a fucking shroomer.

235
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,480
What is it?

236
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,119
Something cool. Come on.

237
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,119
To get a monster with higher stats, the two monsters you're combining need to be friends.

238
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What?

239
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

240
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
To get a monster with better, with higher stats, the two monsters you're combining need to be friends.

241
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You can see how good of friends they are by going into the Breeder tab and going to the last page.

242
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
What?

243
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,380
How can you be friends when you're frozen and dead?

244
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,940
I don't know how that works.

245
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,779
KD, five community subs.

246
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:31,779
Thank you, KD.

247
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
Welcome back.

248
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:39,849
KD, give him more subs.

249
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,150
Thank you so much, KD.

250
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:53,720
Now we got a robo bunny.

251
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,839
Yeah.

252
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,589
Yeah, we're taking this monster home.

253
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:03,589
We got a farm full of robots.

254
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:08,819
It's a X bunny.

255
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:11,309
No.

256
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,450
Bunny.

257
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,220
The energizer rabbit.

258
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,420
Did the energizer rabbit have a name?

259
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
I like energizer.

260
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:34,819
It was bunny. No, it was not.

261
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Five more community subs from KD.

262
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,900
Thank you, KD.

263
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,140
Again, ten now.

264
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,980
How about a, how about vroomer?

265
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,980
How about, how about energizer?

266
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:57,490
Like this.

267
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:13,920
The energizer.

268
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,859
Energize sleep.

269
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:28,900
All right, energize.

270
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,069
He's a little sleepy.

271
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:35,490
All right, let's go to the ranch.

272
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,859
We got some new stuff.

273
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,890
It's time.

274
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,640
So here are the two.

275
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,200
We got energize prover and Roberto.

276
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Roberto is, sole purpose is to grind tournaments.

277
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
These two are going to just relax.

278
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
I don't care.

279
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,819
They're not joining any tournaments.

280
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:06,819
Let me take a little bit.

281
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Let's just hold that thought.

282
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah, you guys just rest and eat and just go to training.

283
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You are going to grind tournaments.

284
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:34,430
In each rank unlocks more monster fusion types.

285
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,430
So after D, new races unlock is possible on the discs you put in.

286
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,430
All right, cool.

287
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,430
So let's, it's going to grind up tournaments.

288
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,430
When's the next one?

289
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,430
More community subs from KD.

290
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:48,799
My God.

291
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:50,799
Thank you, KD.

292
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:52,799
For your, every five minutes.

293
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,549
Is it the tournament today?

294
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:56,549
Let's go.

295
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,549
Join it, Roberto.

296
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:01,880
He's ready.

297
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
Just crush the competition.

298
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,359
He's so good.

299
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,240
And you guys, who gives a shit?

300
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,769
You can just do whatever you want.

301
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:19,940
No, automatic for technique.

302
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,230
I mean you, automatic for speed.

303
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,859
Yeah, who cares?

304
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,420
They're just DNA.

305
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,740
Roberto is going to do life training today.

306
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,890
It's a little quiet.

307
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,559
Nine health from Roberto.

308
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,019
That's good.

309
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,029
Kill or be killed?

310
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:57,029
You're doing just good.

311
00:27:58,029 --> 00:27:59,029
Let's give you some food.

312
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:01,029
Because we have to just grind tournaments.

313
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:03,029
Oh shit, I'm out of food.

314
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,779
You can use squid today.

315
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,630
I'll go buy some food tomorrow.

316
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,630
Let's see how funny.

317
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:20,819
Okay, depending on how funny and cute they are.

318
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:22,819
You're a lot bigger than I thought you were.

319
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,410
I hate this thing so much.

320
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,900
I really hope that that stupid mushroom is not the most powerful thing we have.

321
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,299
We all love him.

322
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:40,299
No, you don't.

323
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,299
I can't wait to see in the chat in an hour or two.

324
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:46,059
Burn him.

325
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,059
Just eat him.

326
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:50,059
Ice him.

327
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,829
Kill that fucking stupid thing.

328
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:59,980
It's going to be everywhere.

329
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,980
It's the dumbest monster that we've ever seen.

330
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,220
And there's going to be an argument in chat.

331
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,220
I don't know why you guys think that.

332
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,650
Like why do you think that?

333
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,650
Like that person's name.

334
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,650
Like are you stupid?

335
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:22,539
I saw, I see that you've only been a follower of the channel for like two months.

336
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:24,710
I was here when Beanbag Sonic was created.

337
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,710
You don't know shit, idiot.

338
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,710
And then that person's going to be like, fuck you man.

339
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,710
It's going to cause problems.

340
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:42,740
Don't do that.

341
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,990
All right, what do you got?

342
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,990
Nothing.

343
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:53,819
I don't even need to look at the stats.

344
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:55,819
Roberto is too good.

345
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,950
I see you've only been a follower for two months.

346
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,690
I was here when Beanbag Sonic was created.

347
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,690
Look at that thing.

348
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,670
It really is cooking.

349
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,819
It's all right.

350
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,210
It's a little rusty.

351
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,210
This is such a high hit for someone.

352
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
I just need to do three of these and we can get the secret.

353
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:46,180
Guy versus Ghassan.

354
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,089
Ghassan wins.

355
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,950
And then the championship is against Ghassan.

356
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,950
This is one of those big rocks.

357
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,950
Lots of life.

358
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,950
Pretty good defense.

359
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,950
Just kind of have to knock it hit.

360
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,750
That'll be good.

361
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,750
Guy Ghassan was a French revolutionary, I think.

362
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:18,119
Guy Ghassan.

363
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,769
Monster.

364
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:26,490
Bingo.

365
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,299
And then we can go with a shoulder tackle.

366
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,380
This, if you don't think we're going to grind up the tournaments and win them.

367
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,380
With Roberto.

368
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,380
It was a long shot with Rumor because Rumor didn't have very good accuracy.

369
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:43,829
I should win all these up to like rank C or B.

370
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:57,759
One final tip from the Monster Rancher expert.

371
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:04,759
The good trick is to get the house that allows you to have four monsters have three you don't care about doing exploring.

372
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,759
And one you use to get your rank up.

373
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,759
All right.

374
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,759
Well, I already meeting you halfway there because I already don't care about the other two.

375
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,759
So I'm already getting to that point.

376
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:28,349
I miss Wally, but you gotta move on.

377
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,940
All right.

378
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
So let's go to the calendar.

379
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
The next tournament here is for Roberto.

380
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Sign you up for that one.

381
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Just do any every single one I can do in a row.

382
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,059
That's at least ranked D.

383
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:57,059
Now the other two are going to just go for go on a walk.

384
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:04,220
Let me take a look at this.

385
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,220
So you let me do.

386
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Why don't you just do intelligence.

387
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Just make it at least look like you're trying.

388
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
And then speed.

389
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,220
I don't have to think of speed accuracy.

390
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,640
What did you have Roberto?

391
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
You can sleep now.

392
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,140
You're good.

393
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
I think you can do life again, right?

394
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,079
Yeah, life blade then rest.

395
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:38,660
I think I should maybe I should bring them all exploring because Roberto's almost level five.

396
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:44,490
I need food.

397
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,769
I'll go to town this week because he does that with his ears.

398
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:55,769
Weirdly enough.

399
00:33:57,009 --> 00:33:58,009
Yeah, you are tired.

400
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:12,789
You're tired. I don't want to bring you.

401
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:14,789
Oh, I hate you so much.

402
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:20,619
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it.

403
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:25,289
I'm turning the page with his face.

404
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:33,030
I need food.

405
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,920
I would like to buy.

406
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
I got lots of money.

407
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:44,289
Let's get some like 10 potatoes because I always use them.

408
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:50,409
Let's get like five bananas.

409
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:54,250
Maybe a couple of squids.

410
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,250
Beef is too expensive.

411
00:34:58,489 --> 00:34:59,489
Squid.

412
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,489
I'll get like three squids for Roberto.

413
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,760
And.

414
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,760
I feel like I said I have so much stuff to sell, but I don't know the hell it does.

415
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,329
Like Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

416
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,329
These battle cards.

417
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,329
What are these even for?

418
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:27,329
Silver coin, amethyst.

419
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,570
Hey, where's the monster rancher expert?

420
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,570
You still here?

421
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,570
What are these for?

422
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:43,659
Yes, I am. All right. What what are these for?

423
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:47,300
Should I just sell all this expensive stuff?

424
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,300
Luxuries?

425
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:53,849
It's for fusions later on.

426
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:55,849
Okay, so don't use them.

427
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,340
Ooh.

428
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
All right. Don't use these either.

429
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,269
I'm not going to use them. I'm going to hold on.

430
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,090
I hate forever so much.

431
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,090
I'm whimpering right now.

432
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,210
Don't worry.

433
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,210
We'll only walk the plank in like a few days.

434
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,710
Some of those will relieve stress.

435
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:33,460
Okay, the way we raise Roberto from this point on will determine the difference between victory and defeat.

436
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,829
Roberto is now no longer a baby.

437
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:42,590
Rest.

438
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,590
And then you got a sandbag.

439
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,590
Let me take an actual look here.

440
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,469
220 power.

441
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:53,469
Accuracy could use a little work and so could speed.

442
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:56,349
Accuracy and speed.

443
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,349
Although his moves are so accurate anyways.

444
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
All right. What does it say? Your favorite food?

445
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:10,579
His moves.

446
00:37:12,139 --> 00:37:13,699
Traits, super weapon.

447
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,699
Record.

448
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:17,699
Temper, cool, size, normal. Likes, reference.

449
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:19,699
Doesn't like to sleep.

450
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:26,820
What do you mean likes to be referenced?

451
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:38,460
Why would you not like to sleep?

452
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,460
That's kind of strange.

453
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,670
You have to rest though.

454
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,670
Do you have to rest?

455
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:53,409
Maybe he doesn't have to sleep.

456
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:55,409
Okay, well.

457
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,639
All right.

458
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,650
What about these other two?

459
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,650
Let's make sure they're at least doing something.

460
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
Let's do automatic.

461
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,960
Ah, fuck me.

462
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,059
I didn't mean to press X.

463
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:20,619
Let me go talk to him.

464
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:24,269
He likes references.

465
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,269
I have those.

466
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:28,269
Item, reference.

467
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:30,269
Items of knowledge.

468
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,639
Here.

469
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
I just have to show it to him and he likes it.

470
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,190
Is he holding it?

471
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,719
Ah.

472
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:48,369
He doesn't even read it.

473
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,369
He just looks at it and goes, yes.

474
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,699
He's happy.

475
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
That's my favorite book.

476
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,320
As you know, I'm building an underdog story here.

477
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,769
Let's take, let's get them.

478
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:34,769
Yeah, let's go.

479
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
Let's still do the caves.

480
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,460
Try to level up again.

481
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,210
Bring him up.

482
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
Kill the shroom.

483
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,780
No, I want to progress in the cave.

484
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,199
Because he's almost level five.

485
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:08,019
This will at least get him maybe into the move or another trade maybe.

486
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:10,019
That'd be good.

487
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:17,059
Oh yeah, right.

488
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:19,380
I have to turn this down every time I come in here.

489
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
Give shroom a chance to let him prove himself.

490
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,630
Nah.

491
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,630
It's going to end up as a scenario where he accidentally comes.

492
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,630
Roberto's going to get hurt.

493
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,639
And shroom is going to have to come off the bench.

494
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,639
It's going to be the last person.

495
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,820
I'm going to be the coach sitting there staring into the audience.

496
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,820
Being like, is there anybody in here that I can throw?

497
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,820
Any of you?

498
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
I'm looking for my star quarterback got hurt.

499
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:46,059
And no one's going to raise their hands.

500
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:49,059
And I'm going to have to go to the bench and there's going to be the shroom.

501
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:52,059
And I'm going to, I'm going to wince and go.

502
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:54,489
Get in there.

503
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:56,980
He's going to be like, oh, okay.

504
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,980
It's going to be a very, very defining moment of his character.

505
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,980
He's going to get in.

506
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,980
He's going to get the ball.

507
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,980
And it's going to be, here we go with like five seconds left.

508
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,980
One, two, three.

509
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,980
And he's going to go back.

510
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
It's going to be in slow motion.

511
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
And here comes like somebody on the left.

512
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Oh, it's a blitz.

513
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
It's an all out blitz.

514
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,230
And as his sweats coming down his head, he's got to prove that one fucking point away from a win.

515
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,230
Literally, he rears back to throw.

516
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,230
And the cuts to the coach.

517
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,539
Can't believe it.

518
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:28,539
Oh, did I make the right decision?

519
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:30,539
Somebody comes he didn't see from his right.

520
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:33,539
He grabs him by the arm, tackles and rips his arm off.

521
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
And he just looks over and starts screaming at his arm.

522
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
That's now just a socket.

523
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,460
Countdown goes down to zero.

524
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,699
You lose the game.

525
00:41:48,260 --> 00:42:01,590
You didn't go fast enough.

526
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,590
Roll the credits.

527
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,590
And as the credits are rolling, like he's getting put on a stretcher.

528
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,590
And like the coach is seen.

529
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,090
Was betting on the other team.

530
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,650
It's like, what the fuck is that?

531
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,650
Hold on.

532
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,650
What's going on over there?

533
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,650
He's playing with the other coach.

534
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,460
He put him in.

535
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,599
Okay, that's weird.

536
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,599
The credits keep going down.

537
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:30,929
After like another 30 seconds of credits, there's a school board meeting.

538
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:33,230
For like the college.

539
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:37,539
And they're shutting down the sports program.

540
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:41,539
Not enough money came in this year because of that horrible loss for the college.

541
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,900
That's not how school funding works.

542
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:29,550
If you lose a monster football tournament.

543
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:41,329
Oh, I got another one of these.

544
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,329
You need a psychopath so you can take all the glory yourself.

545
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:49,809
Now you're thinking, now you're thinking with portals.

546
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,630
These monsters are so easy to cut through.

547
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:10,590
All right, five, what do we get?

548
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:21,010
That's it?

549
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,010
I don't think you get anything for level five.

550
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,940
Not even flex tape.

551
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:55,780
Please no portal spoilers.

552
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,230
I'm sorry.

553
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:06,340
I didn't mean to.

554
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,340
Most of the items you find in this dungeon, you give to your monsters.

555
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,340
Later on, items need to be appraised.

556
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,340
Then used in fusions.

557
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
That mist, how?

558
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,570
You need to milk rumor before he died.

559
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,510
No.

560
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,019
You can't do that in this game.

561
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:46,019
I just want to get him to level five but it seems like he didn't get anything.

562
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,670
Why do I keep, I don't know guys.

563
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:02,670
I wish I could tell you why I read those.

564
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,940
It just kind of is there.

565
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,559
As a one hit kill.

566
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:13,139
I just, I look over and I see it and it's just, oh okay.

567
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:17,369
One guy.

568
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:26,389
Read the good boy messages for once.

569
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:28,389
All right.

570
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:33,630
I'm no longer going to read those messages that come up about like milking people.

571
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,340
So don't even try.

572
00:46:52,340 --> 00:47:03,610
I really love your stuff by the way, have you?

573
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,170
Pretty good try.

574
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,289
Damn, okay.

575
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:27,659
97 damage.

576
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:29,659
Do you like the TV show The Venture Brothers?

577
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:33,349
Yeah, it's a good show.

578
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:35,909
It was fun, funny.

579
00:47:36,909 --> 00:47:37,909
Didn't they bring it back for like a special season or something?

580
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:39,909
Or is it actually back now forever?

581
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:48,739
They're still making episodes.

582
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:54,059
It never ended.

583
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:57,059
Didn't it go on like a hiatus for six years or something?

584
00:47:58,059 --> 00:48:02,619
More than that.

585
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:04,619
It was a long time ago.

586
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Nobody stands a chance.

587
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:21,010
152 damage.

588
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,719
I just, I don't belong here.

589
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:33,230
Almost level six though.

590
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:35,230
All right, can anybody help me with the...

591
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,010
Hasn't every Adult Swim show been canceled at some point?

592
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,010
Yeah.

593
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Adult Swim is such a weird network.

594
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,969
Because they just like kind of throw spaghetti into the ceiling.

595
00:48:51,969 --> 00:49:00,380
And then sometimes a piece will stick.

596
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,380
All right, what about the other monsters?

597
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:08,630
Roberto can't help you, but what about the other ones?

598
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:10,630
Can the bunny do something here?

599
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:13,860
What about Prover?

600
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:28,699
But I think some of my, probably some of my favorite shows,

601
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:34,570
at least back when I watched TV every day were on Adult Swim,

602
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:45,510
there were some really good shows.

603
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,820
I have like four of those.

604
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,579
I hate Prover so much.

605
00:49:57,579 --> 00:49:58,579
Don't you understand?

606
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:11,130
Well, just wait for the football game.

607
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,130
Please, no.

608
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:15,429
That was too dark.

609
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,019
Get in there.

610
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:21,019
Really? You're a little bunny rabbit and you can't go in a little bunny rabbit hole.

611
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,019
Wait, we have to see the animation.

612
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:34,429
What happened?

613
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:41,090
Did you hear that?

614
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,019
You have the least offensive walk.

615
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:51,019
Sound and animation.

616
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:04,659
Offensive, yeah, like offensive to my ears.

617
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:09,969
660 points.

618
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:14,320
There are too many bats.

619
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,320
Yeah, there are.

620
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
Yeah, there are.

621
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:23,570
Languages are so weird.

622
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:28,239
There are.

623
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:30,239
I just said the same word.

624
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:33,059
English is so hard to understand.

625
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:35,059
Oh, they're over there.

626
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,059
What did you say?

627
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,380
Let's see what the bunny can do.

628
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,380
One damage.

629
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,380
Wait, what's this? Is this a scream?

630
00:51:58,679 --> 00:51:59,679
This is a scream.

631
00:52:02,139 --> 00:52:03,139
This is bunny Pogchamp.

632
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:05,139
You guys want to be able to enable Pog?

633
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:08,400
There it is.

634
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:16,079
I can't even go.

635
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,840
Back up and do it.

636
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,840
I can't move back to have me back it up.

637
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,139
Here we go.

638
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:28,139
It's called Muhaha.

639
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,500
Muhaha.

640
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:48,050
What?

641
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,050
Oh, this is.

642
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,929
How much damage?

643
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:59,760
Weak.

644
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,469
What about, let's bring in the plant.

645
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,099
Prove it.

646
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:08,590
You got Pecking and Joseph Pollen.

647
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,570
Joseph Pollen.

648
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,570
Pretty sick move.

649
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:24,980
Pretty sick move.

650
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,739
Sorry, I just screamed at you.

651
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,099
Golden Foot.

652
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,340
Sniper.

653
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:42,380
Probably better for the Pollen attack.

654
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,380
Well, he does have high intelligence, so that helps.

655
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,420
Another sword.

656
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,460
Yeah.

657
00:53:56,889 --> 00:53:57,889
Let's see.

658
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:01,780
Bunny's traits are.

659
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,780
Power moves that use the feet and do just damage, but it's harder to dodge.

660
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,719
And the traits for Prover are.

661
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:10,719
Magic Lore.

662
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,960
Ups magic power and lets you add a magic to skill.

663
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,969
I still don't know what that means.

664
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,969
And then Sniper and Pheromone.

665
00:54:21,969 --> 00:54:22,969
Increase power moves that use charm.

666
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:24,969
It's like a charm enemies.

667
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:38,530
What do you guys think is the hardest English sentence to remotely understand for someone that does not speak it?

668
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:47,099
It's got to be something with the words that sound exactly the same, but mean different things.

669
00:54:48,099 --> 00:55:05,250
Follow German985 on Twitch is the hardest thing to understand.

670
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:09,280
Buffalo?

671
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,059
What do you mean, Buffalo?

672
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,920
That's the hardest word to understand?

673
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,389
He doesn't know.

674
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:41,019
No, I don't.

675
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:43,019
I don't know what that means.

676
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:47,949
Well, don't let him die.

677
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:50,960
Pull him out quick.

678
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,960
Pull him out.

679
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Pull him out.

680
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,460
Bring in Roberto.

681
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,869
I don't want anybody dying.

682
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
Wikipedia.

683
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
There's a Wikipedia article for the word Buffalo.

684
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,500
It's like eight times.

685
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:25,280
It's a grammatically correct sentence in American English, often presented as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used to create complicated linguistic constructs through lexical ambiguity.

686
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,280
It has been discussed in literature in various forms when it appeared in Beyond Language Adventures in Word and Thought.

687
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:55,980
The sentence employs three distinct meanings of the word Buffalo as a proper noun to refer to a specific place named Buffalo, the city of Buffalo, New York, as a verb meaning to bully, harass, or intimidate, as a noun to refer to the animal more easily decoded, though semantically equivalent would be bison from buffalo.

688
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:00,150
That other bison from buffalo bully themselves, bully bison from buffalo.

689
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:16,619
But that's not.

690
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:23,619
All right, I'm done.

691
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,300
I'm not, I don't want to read that anymore.

692
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,360
But that's not a sentence.

693
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:46,219
turn slash nice but about I mean it is a sentence but those are just words you

694
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:53,869
just it's just Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo it's a noun verb in an adjective that's

695
00:57:53,869 --> 00:58:07,519
a stupid Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo

696
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:32,699
yeah but you don't say Buffalo from Buffalo that's right you say Buffalo

697
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:41,420
Buffalo how late to my how late am I to the party here

698
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:56,090
word bump any word is weird when you say it let's say pick a word okay I'm gonna

699
00:58:56,090 --> 00:59:02,010
use the word mosquito okay when you say a word that many times you think about a

700
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:07,969
word that many times it becomes so strange mosquito mosquito mosquito

701
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:20,840
mosquito mosquito that doesn't sound right now the speed is too much just

00:59:44,659 --> 01:00:12,159

01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:27,219
actually speaks the way that is written semantic say see say semantic

707
01:00:27,219 --> 01:00:32,039
satiation if that's not like a real sentence but that's not you wouldn't

708
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:42,039
have a conversation like that with somebody if somebody was talking like

709
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:48,659
that on the subway you'd move two seats to the right you'd be like I don't know

710
01:00:48,659 --> 01:00:57,599
this person's fucking kind of crazy John had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had had you'd be

711
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:18,500
like move down a few seats it's a hundred percent grammatically perfect

712
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:33,900
and that's the point you're missing the point don't hurt yourself trying to

713
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:38,300
no I get it I know it's like a complete grammatical sentence but I'm talking

714
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,579
about if somebody was learning English you wouldn't a difficult sentence for

715
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:48,099
them to understand would not be John had had had had had had had had had had had

716
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:52,699
had had had had had had had right I'm talking about like a sentence that you

717
01:01:52,699 --> 01:02:03,239
would see in like everyday life that's not a goalpost move that's like that's

718
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:56,250
not and nobody has that conversation final guts this topics fucking sucks is

719
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:20,949
it not really it's not really a topic as much as it's a question but can be

720
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:32,940
understood through I'm not reading it I'm not gonna read it no I've already

721
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:53,630
read two of them Buffalo had had had had Buffalo had Chad what what is this

722
01:03:53,630 --> 01:04:14,250
that's it I beat it so I got a new move for I was almost gonna say Chad let's

723
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:32,989
take a look there's a calm turn slash life damage a cut into is also a this

724
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:38,619
takes 30 guts this takes 20 so a little bit more to use it accuracy see

725
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:45,840
accuracy ease more accurate mid-range so it's it's kind of better than cutting

726
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:54,099
too it just takes more to use but that's fine I'd rather use that to be honest

727
01:04:54,099 --> 01:05:02,150
does the same amount of damage and hits more often but just time it better with

728
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:09,429
the guts then you get something else to somebody else somebody get something

729
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:21,239
else all right you like golden sword and honey you don't like honey toast you

in the bathroom and I'm just peeing she hears piss going into the toilet right

873
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:46,100

01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:51,100
like I cook it was like she's closing me up bang piss comes up real fast like

875

to have to sit here and relax I really do why was Kim listen because she was

878
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:37,859
like the way that the bathroom is set up is there's the bathroom and then there's

879
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:45,909
a door to the toilet so it's like this tiny little airplane bathroom that's

880
01:36:45,909 --> 01:36:51,829
inside of a bathroom it's kind of weird there's a door to the toilet but then

881
01:36:51,829 --> 01:36:56,050
there's an actual like bathroom with like a sink and shit there's like a stall

882

how did we get there because the mushroom was doing a weird workout that

884
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:13,619

885
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:16,239
ears and it's hard to talk and then people at the gym do that and it's like

886
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:28,640
funny and then I don't know they got somehow from there but we are going to

you're in a dream this is what you'll see you'll see like a goofy claymation

919
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:12,069

like a bird which one looks worse though let's let's be honest where is it I

921

actually think that the other one might look better you deliberately fucked with

922
01:44:43,449 --> 01:44:49,119
this and I think the picture on the left is uglier than the one on the right I

02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:53,920

02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:57,960
and then light blade twice sounds good and then I'm also gonna make sure you

1006
02:06:13,930 --> 02:06:32,319
uh I can't like play when shit like this is in the chat you know how difficult

1007
02:06:32,319 --> 02:06:35,800
it is for me to like focus on this video game when this is in the chat over and

1008
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:54,069
over again what image is this and why is it still in the background no let's go

1009

1016
02:08:15,319 --> 02:08:24,579
hard to say so he's gonna rest today they both I like Monster Rancher 2's

1017
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:32,239
minigame system better because this is kind of just numbers on the screen

1018
02:08:32,239 --> 02:08:37,390
whereas you got to actually see the fun little animation play out and and

1019
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:40,630
although they were they were repetitive it was still fun to see them all right

1020
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:47,109
we can buy something maybe here what will you do I can I buy a bigger house

1021
02:08:47,109 --> 02:08:55,159
like blade tub trampoline target book sandbag what am I missing trampoline

1022
02:08:55,159 --> 02:09:04,100
target I have no I have it all how do I buy a bigger house praise anything

1023
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:13,829
customize is there a way I can custom I can buy a bigger house I do have to win

1024
02:09:13,829 --> 02:09:36,369
more tournaments it's another corn emote what am I missing another yeah there's

1025
02:09:36,369 --> 02:09:44,090
like 10 or 12 corn emotes flying around can't really do anything

1026
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:59,810
all right calendar we've got another tournament here almost ready to get out

1027
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:12,189
of D rank and to see rank hopefully you can do some some accuracy training you

1028
02:10:12,189 --> 02:10:23,949
can do some more like we need some more help on you who cares rest and then your

1029
02:10:23,949 --> 02:10:38,220
tournament sounds good begin well that's terrible some people have all

1030
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:48,760
their whole channels emotes corn related how the hell would you do that

1031
02:10:49,159 --> 02:10:57,939
that's almost as dumb as having him be completely planet related like every

1032
02:10:57,939 --> 02:11:04,920
emotes a planet just like a royalty-free NASA image with like your face on it

1033
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:11,390
from like a picture you took at Blizzcon like four and a half years ago I mean

1034
02:11:17,630 --> 02:11:26,039
you can eat too I know you don't like bananas but do you know do you like

1035
02:11:26,039 --> 02:11:41,090
bananas let me see get Roberto in their steam role another time yeah steam roll

1036
02:11:41,090 --> 02:11:46,859
another competition and then we can finally climb out of this dumb rank

1037
02:11:46,859 --> 02:11:53,789
German says he won't read gross messages but spends an hour crying at a fart joke

1038
02:11:53,789 --> 02:11:58,470
it wasn't the fact that it was a fart it was the fact that it was loud and it was

1039
02:11:58,470 --> 02:12:03,430
the whole scenario it wasn't just the fart that I thought was funny it was the

1040
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:09,090
entire bowl soup it wasn't just the carrots it was the lentils it was the

1041
02:12:09,090 --> 02:12:14,279
kale it was the broth the whole bowl soup was hilarious to me

1042
02:12:14,279 --> 02:12:20,460
Freudian weapon thanks for 10 bucks no 10 bucks 10 community subs not 10 bucks

1043
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:28,680
that's way more than $10 Freudian coming in 10 community subs thanks for 10

1044
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:44,920
bucks thank you Freudian 10 community subs rolling it did I just described

1045
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:49,880
farts like a bowl soup no I described the whole scenario as many ingredients

1046
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:54,399
into why I thought that was that funny German is a mature streamer that's I'm

1047
02:12:54,399 --> 02:13:01,970
not gonna it's all right by the way this is a fluffy dog rumor that's actually

1048
02:13:01,970 --> 02:13:13,949
pretty cool turnslash and just wait bingo Roberto

1049
02:13:13,949 --> 02:13:27,399
maybe I should just build up I think I'm just gonna oh okay for Roberto now I'm

1050
02:13:27,399 --> 02:13:32,880
just gonna build accuracy and power and just try to beat the complete glass

1051
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:37,479
cannon where you have you just have really high chance to hit and just try

1052
02:13:37,479 --> 02:13:51,079
to kill things in one or two hits preferably one hit opponent quit afraid

1053
02:13:51,079 --> 02:13:59,600
of Roberto holiday versus they're all the same monster I got this in the back

1054
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:13,130
I still have this corn on my monitor gets out of here every time I close a

1055
02:14:13,130 --> 02:14:16,770
window there's another fucked up image that I have to see I have like 10 tabs

1056
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:31,460
open that's it one almost one hit it's okay what is a higher hit percent chance

1057
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:51,159
slash does well I missed the kick no that's not good no that's not good at

1058
02:14:51,159 --> 02:14:58,470
all all right back it up getting close now closer closer closer closer

1059
02:14:58,630 --> 02:15:18,609
all right that's why I got to build up accuracy and power you run into a

1060
02:15:18,609 --> 02:15:24,260
scenario where I'm just gonna burn through guts and lose what I get the

1061
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:31,329
money yeah the dashing is what did it but I just didn't want to get in range I

1062
02:15:31,329 --> 02:15:52,060
got a peach cool Roberto getting pretty popular almost 50 so then let's take a

1063
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:57,699
look at the calendar you got official tournament here or Roberto let's get him in

1064
02:15:57,699 --> 02:16:09,510
tip-top shape we have two cycles to work with today let me see 228 power I

1065
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:12,670
got to get that accuracy up German a lot about Minecraft VR thanks to five

1066
02:16:12,670 --> 02:16:21,020
community subs more community subs rolling in thank you guys more community

1067
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:30,979
sub drops you guys are very generous thank you accuracy and speed are

1068
02:16:30,979 --> 02:16:45,379
probably what I need to do accuracy speed and power so let's take this get

1069
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:56,760
life out of here accuracy speed let's do accuracy twice and then we'll rest before

1070
02:16:56,760 --> 02:17:03,780
the tournament he's tired he's tired we'll do we'll rest now and then we'll

1071
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:14,270
do two days of accuracy training that should be good what about you guys you

1072
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:21,940
let's get you into yeah let me just even look up you guys are just useless so who

1073
02:17:21,940 --> 02:17:30,459
cares your life your intelligence a great power act but you're not gonna be

1074
02:17:30,459 --> 02:17:36,479
doing back accuracy and defense probably important let's just do accuracy and

1075
02:17:36,479 --> 02:17:43,399
intelligence then or this is good intelligence like over 200 or defense

1076
02:17:44,040 --> 02:18:01,170
I'm gonna say defense defense book is fine and then what about you kind of

1077
02:18:01,170 --> 02:18:05,440
balanced all the way around except your health is terrible uh I'm gonna say

1078
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:13,260
health and speed or health and accuracy let's just do health a couple times what

1079
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:18,620
does intelligence improve it improves magic damage any move that is a green

1080
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:22,579
move not a yellow move yellow is based on power green is based on intelligence

1081
02:18:22,579 --> 02:18:28,780
so it makes you do more damage with your green based intelligence based moves

1082
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:33,899
and I believe it also increases your defense to those moves as well at least

1083
02:18:33,899 --> 02:18:39,120
I think that's what it was like in the second game yeah it's like magic resist

1084
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:46,000
because defense does not help with magic damage I don't think I think that's good

1085
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:56,379
you just need health right health and health

1086
02:18:56,379 --> 02:19:10,229
your health is terrible all right good night not reasoned by very much

1087
02:19:10,229 --> 02:19:21,520
tired you can rest tomorrow frustrated oh no wait how are you doing lively good

1088
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:38,469
have a potato what flavor mushroom is that lemon lime that's a sprite flavored

1089
02:19:38,469 --> 02:19:55,319
mushroom oh sorry a surge flavored mushroom it's probably more accurate so

1090
02:19:55,319 --> 02:20:06,350
the tournaments tomorrow right here so I got a couple of days you killed Wally

1091
02:20:06,350 --> 02:20:18,479
no I had to I had to do it all right you're frustrated so you don't do anything

1092
02:20:18,479 --> 02:20:43,340
today rest and then book you are tired so rest and then like blade you are

1093
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:53,209
going to target training and then maybe target training again go for it that was

1094
02:20:53,209 --> 02:21:02,239
really good plus 12 into accuracy and we doing it tomorrow as well good work

1095
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:22,100
anybody else need anything I think everyone's asleep yeah you're good next

1096
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:31,219
day next week competition is one more day nobody can join this one so I can't

1097
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:41,770
do it this will hopefully get us to see I really hope so because that'd be the

1098
02:21:41,770 --> 02:21:46,229
first time we've been able to do it I'm getting carried by Roberto oh yeah

1099
02:21:46,229 --> 02:21:54,620
absolutely so you can probably do this training and be fine yeah and I'll just

1100
02:21:54,620 --> 02:22:13,540
feed you you'll be fine you're lively okay not bad please don't be tired nice

1101
02:22:13,540 --> 02:22:23,190
okay good have some good food we're gonna give you a oh I wonder if I should

1102
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:26,969
give him an energy bar no this is too expensive maybe I'll just give it to

1103
02:22:26,969 --> 02:22:37,739
him so I can guarantee myself yeah I'm gonna give it to him take this and get

1104
02:22:37,739 --> 02:23:01,040
us into rank C he's good Roberto's gonna get addicted to energy bars fuse him

1105
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:10,569
before he dies his genes are too good to lose I'll make sure all right we got a

1106
02:23:10,610 --> 02:23:17,899
bullshit ending on the last time we did this by Calabrino last standing like

1107
02:23:17,899 --> 02:23:27,930
three times my stats are really really good I have amazing moves this is just

1108
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:37,500
high intelligence watch out for the int attacks I gave myself some more

1109
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:53,639
accuracy this should help a lot he's already starting up good block get in

1110
02:23:53,639 --> 02:23:56,270
there get in there don't let him do anything

1111
02:23:56,270 --> 02:24:02,959
all right all right I'm gonna stick with this just a regular slash does so

1112
02:24:02,959 --> 02:24:12,129
much damage just twice if you can start it off with that turn slash move the

1113
02:24:12,129 --> 02:24:15,850
jumping one then you're good to go but if you don't get it first I'm not gonna

1114
02:24:15,850 --> 02:24:26,620
do it again because it takes 30 guts not a good idea Roberto currently is

1115
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:31,959
probably gonna live to three and a half years old energy bars boosts and remove

1116
02:24:31,959 --> 02:24:37,100
some of the remaining time alive yeah that's good to know so energy bars

1117
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:40,969
actually take years off of their life

1118
02:24:44,680 --> 02:24:52,420
state pretty much balanced across the board except no power and no defense

1119
02:24:52,420 --> 02:25:15,100
really stay away from the intelligence moves from what it seems and go bye stay

1120
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:22,629
in close see you guys at rank C cuz that's definitely where we're gonna be

1121
02:25:22,629 --> 02:25:35,379
at the end of this and I'll see you at rank B not long after probably

1122
02:25:35,819 --> 02:25:44,319
most I've not seen so far since playing very many high-power enemies everyone's

1123
02:25:44,319 --> 02:26:04,370
building intelligence for some reason very few high-power enemies all right

1124
02:26:04,370 --> 02:26:13,399
that's all right not good good final guts all right that's annoying

1125
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:31,969
that's also annoying not good thank God final guts is the worst

1126
02:26:31,969 --> 02:26:38,260
oh is there a way that I wonder there's a move you can get where you just turn

1127
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:58,200
off their final guts I wonder if there's a stay dead move it always ends in

1128
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:04,219
Calabrino so I just have to beat everybody here all right here we go high

1129
02:27:04,219 --> 02:27:09,700
power of high life decent speed this is gonna be hard I get it I'm okay I'm not

1130
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:15,780
gonna do I'm only gonna do slash here because it's the highest accuracy that

1131
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:29,340
I have he'll dodge everything just getting close that's not a good start

1132
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:36,629
that's a really bad start just don't even give him a chance again 78% chance

1133
02:27:36,629 --> 02:28:07,510
to hit this got only one more two more fights Roberto versus Calarino round two

1134
02:28:07,510 --> 02:28:13,959
have you improved at all high intelligence low power high health so

1135
02:28:13,959 --> 02:28:24,940
just watch out for the intelligence moves and try to just burn down I'm only

1136
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:31,860
gonna go for slashes here I already saw that dialogue I already read it in a

1137
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:45,579
funny voice didn't I all right monitor guts get in close and slash good block

1138
02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:58,489
84% chance to hit this perfect do it again 83% goodbye that was we didn't get

1139
02:28:58,489 --> 02:29:05,979
that was such bullshit last time I did this was two final guts going up to

1140
02:29:05,979 --> 02:29:20,790
rank C Roberto really is just extraordinarily powerful that's why I

1141
02:29:20,790 --> 02:29:26,180
want to try to just grind to rank a so we can unlock some more monsters how

1142
02:29:26,219 --> 02:29:32,430
could I lose to this kid this is just unbelievable whoo two grand of a squid

1143
02:29:32,430 --> 02:29:58,569
Roberto you've done it you brought us into a new ring congratulations Fane I

1144
02:29:58,569 --> 02:30:05,370
had no idea you'd come so far I mean no sorry what it's all right see oh no that

1145
02:30:05,370 --> 02:30:09,989
was me talking it's all right see so I can't even believe that myself I mean

1146
02:30:09,989 --> 02:30:14,329
shoot after I was kicked out of Elvis school I thought that I'd lost my last

1147
02:30:14,329 --> 02:30:19,860
chance there are always chances people just overlook them Rio you've really

1148
02:30:19,860 --> 02:30:25,559
made a wonderful ranch Fane you look after this ranch in Rio too yes sir leave

1149
02:30:25,559 --> 02:30:33,440
it to me cheers oh you really did it you're all I thought you'd be now you've

Association shoot we'll just have to come back next week softlock softlock

1243
02:46:42,670 --> 02:47:09,020
softlocked softlocked softlocked oh I was gonna do it right before coming here

1244
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:16,709
but the I got distracted oh no I was gonna do it right before coming here but

1245
02:47:16,750 --> 02:47:21,739
I got distracted by the other town and now the game's softlocked itself thank

1246
02:47:21,739 --> 02:47:27,020
fucking God get me back quick oh my goodness that would have been such a

1247
02:47:27,020 --> 02:47:30,459
horrendous end to the stream because of what am I gonna go back and do three

1248
02:47:30,459 --> 02:47:42,149
hours worth of Monster Ranger again get me back there quick that was I didn't

1249
02:47:42,149 --> 02:47:50,520
save one time this whole entire stream look at that that's the walnut is still

1250
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:59,610
in here guys that was before I even froze walnut and from her

1251
02:47:59,610 --> 02:48:15,530
shit that would have been so bad that was this entire stream almost three

1252
02:48:15,530 --> 02:48:24,520
hours all right let's see how I fare in C rank we got a couple more three or four

1253
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:28,459
more weeks what are you doing you're resting today yes you're very tired you

1254
02:48:28,459 --> 02:48:30,420
deserve it target training twice and then we'd be

1255
02:48:30,420 --> 02:48:41,649
sandbag training after a rest that's good pretty good recovery why did I

1256
02:48:41,649 --> 02:48:46,299
freeze rumor because we got to the realization that Roberto was the only

1257
02:48:46,299 --> 02:48:50,120
one that was gonna take us through to a higher rank so then we made these two

1258
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:55,670
assholes that were just kind of funny characters to be side content comic

1259
02:48:55,670 --> 02:49:03,239
relief characters for the main character who is this one and so far I think it's

1260
02:49:03,239 --> 02:49:11,760
worked out pretty well you almost gave me a heart attack with that softlock I

1261
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:15,479
almost had a heart attack in the chair here playing the game we went in almost

1262
02:49:15,479 --> 02:49:22,010
softlocked or hard I would be a hard lock at that point we can do anybody

1263
02:49:22,170 --> 02:49:37,520
frustrated here just be happy what would you have done if it had actually

1264
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:42,639
crashed I'm gonna be real with you guys I am having a lot of fun playing this

1265
02:49:42,639 --> 02:49:45,159
and this is like you know the second stream we've done of this game and I'm

1266
02:49:45,159 --> 02:49:50,440
having a good time but that would be so devastating to me that I would probably

1267
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:56,680
just put in mr. mosquito and maybe I would do off-stream I would just grind

1268
02:49:56,680 --> 02:50:17,600
up and do it again you need to eat okay you should probably eat too you don't

1269
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:23,860
want potatoes though here have a peach this is like shaped like you you

1270
02:50:23,860 --> 02:50:38,780
probably like it you loved it but adventure is still a toggle

1271
02:50:38,780 --> 02:50:44,739
caves all right let me go back to town and actually inquire about tournaments

1272
02:50:44,739 --> 02:50:55,540
and stuff maybe that's why there's not an official tournament let's see so it

1273
02:50:55,540 --> 02:51:00,229
appears that you attended Elvis school but later dropped out meaning that you

1274
02:51:00,229 --> 02:51:05,940
don't have an official breeder license then you can't enter the competition

1275
02:51:05,940 --> 02:51:10,639
what but I entered the toggle competition just fine according to your

1276
02:51:10,639 --> 02:51:16,059
toggle registration you entered with a recommendation hmm well for local

1277
02:51:16,059 --> 02:51:18,940
competition recommendations from a respected member of the community is

1278
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:23,540
acceptable but we can't have just anybody entering the top level

1279
02:51:23,739 --> 02:51:31,129
competition hmm but fame is the toggle champion then it shouldn't be a problem

1280
02:51:31,129 --> 02:51:36,139
for him to get a real license now if you would kindly shuffle over to the exit

1281
02:51:36,139 --> 02:51:41,899
all right we need a license shoot we came all this way for nothing what's

1282
02:51:41,899 --> 02:51:48,500
with that I can't believe this I go out on the road for a bit and that little

1283
02:51:48,500 --> 02:51:56,520
brat philia goes and turns into a star what a cruel world TT and she's in a

1284
02:51:56,520 --> 02:52:02,190
very bad mood huh it's you the ones from toggle this is too much I'm going

1446
03:25:30,030 --> 03:25:33,709
these because once you get to like C and B you can die in one or two hits so I

1447
03:25:33,709 --> 03:25:50,649
have to make it count I can get one shot by some of these people all right this

1448
03:25:50,649 --> 03:26:06,409
is Tilden Tilden one why that's why my defense is so bad to 202 power it's just

1449
03:26:06,409 --> 03:26:22,500
gonna come down to who gets who hits first essentially all right I have better

1450
03:26:22,500 --> 03:26:29,620
accuracy don't I oh you got it first sorry I'll answer right here fuck not

1451
03:26:29,620 --> 03:26:36,600
good do it again come on don't lose this here come on don't lose it got it nice

1452
03:26:36,600 --> 03:26:46,239
all right now get him a slash quick again 70% all right I was pretty risky

1453
03:26:46,239 --> 03:27:04,239
that's it do pont I guess no I can lose this here if I

1454
03:27:04,239 --> 03:27:14,000
listed du pont how did you lose so many that insane accuracy insane speed and

1455
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:28,079
high and terrible health though that's probably 125 health do you pond this

1456
03:27:28,079 --> 03:27:42,950
should be one hit see if I can get it so good I just build power and accuracy

1457
03:27:42,950 --> 03:27:51,139
and I can just always open with that move and win that strategy might not

1458
03:27:51,139 --> 03:27:54,299
work getting into rank B and rank a but at least I'll get there

1459
03:27:54,299 --> 03:28:14,579
Alberto is almost too famous almost 100 fame all right so now we're gonna save

1460
03:28:14,579 --> 03:28:24,850
the game rest up a little and then go in the cave

1461
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:39,760
schedule so we've got everyone's tired let's just have this be a day of rest

1462
03:28:39,760 --> 03:28:49,440
for everybody and then you're going full-on sandbag sandbag accuracy

1463
03:28:49,440 --> 03:28:52,440
accuracy

1464
03:28:56,129 --> 03:29:10,940
all right everybody go to bed food has to go around here it's very hungry

1465
03:29:11,940 --> 03:29:25,260
yeah these guys are just bait to go do the adventure mode

1466
03:29:26,780 --> 03:29:34,819
all right I'm out of food hates carrots hates potatoes hates carrots hates

1467
03:29:34,819 --> 03:29:40,340
but I can't know I'm sorry I think it's time for you to go into the fucking yeah

1468
03:29:40,340 --> 03:29:47,000
I'm sorry you you you suck you're too hard to deal with we'll get a new

1469
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:57,719
monster you're fine you're good to go Roberto hates Jeremy I remember that

1470
03:29:57,719 --> 03:30:10,809
that was so fun all right weekend activities let's go find the mushroom

1471
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:35,409
crush it right now not yet so you're trying to healing mushroom I want

1472
03:30:35,409 --> 03:31:02,899
Roberto to get all the experience here did you beat Sekiro actually I did not

1473
03:31:02,899 --> 03:31:07,579
I got to the chained ogre and lost a hundred and forty five times and

1474
03:31:07,579 --> 03:31:24,700
decided the games probably wasn't for me so I just moved on it was so good it

1475
03:31:24,700 --> 03:31:34,920
really is these enemies are nothing now well energized leveled up to level 3

1476
03:31:34,920 --> 03:31:48,889
hard head and on show okay can I do anything with this Roberto's almost

1477
03:31:48,889 --> 03:31:52,809
level six or seven hopefully he gets something else

1478
03:31:52,809 --> 03:32:08,319
come on mushroom all right maybe another couple random encounters so Roberto can

1479
03:32:08,319 --> 03:32:19,770
level up have you beaten ender dragon in minecraft yet no but what happened was I

1480
03:32:19,770 --> 03:32:24,010
actually I got to a point in minecraft I started it and found out the game just

1481
03:32:24,010 --> 03:32:28,450
kind of wasn't for me I got to a creeper and it exploded and I died to a creeper

1482
03:32:28,450 --> 03:32:31,649
like ten times in a row and I was like I just don't think I can it's the games

1483
03:32:31,649 --> 03:32:49,770
are for me so stop playing that's actually true is it though almost level

1484
03:32:49,770 --> 03:33:00,879
seven come on did you ever beat Saxton Hale in team fortress 2 well no because

1485
03:33:00,879 --> 03:33:08,159
I opened up TF2 for the first time and I'm I'm of the opinion that a first

1486
03:33:08,159 --> 03:33:11,799
person shooter should not have somebody that can kill you instantly from behind

1487
03:33:11,799 --> 03:33:15,239
so I got back stabbed and I was like what this is not even a fucking first

1488
03:33:15,239 --> 03:33:33,799
person shooter and I got like irritated so the games just kind of off of me

1489
03:33:33,799 --> 03:33:41,639
hundred and seventy seven damage can I go to a different cave did you ever

1490
03:33:41,639 --> 03:33:47,139
graduate from high school well now what happened was I got to high school and

1491
03:33:47,139 --> 03:33:50,420
it was in ninth grade and I've just I couldn't do it the geometry was way too

1492
03:33:50,420 --> 03:33:54,350
hard so I just said like yeah fuck it is kind of not for me so I just didn't do

1493
03:33:54,350 --> 03:34:03,559
it I stopped high school you know just nothing level seven nothing at level

1494
03:34:03,719 --> 03:34:34,350
seven why really at that's kind of dumb it's like a long time to get there you

1495
03:34:34,350 --> 03:34:50,209
can dodge one you can dodge two but you can't dodge three you're dead yeah I

1496
03:34:50,209 --> 03:34:59,399
gotta get to a new zone this experience is not good enough for Roberto uh explore

1497
03:34:59,399 --> 03:35:03,600
everything I feel like I have to find the mushroom I feel like is it a cut

1498
03:35:03,600 --> 03:35:18,670
scene thing or could I have missed it here I was watching a different streamer

1499
03:35:18,670 --> 03:35:26,190
last night and somebody asked in Chad if they died to pinwheel if you even if

1500
03:35:26,190 --> 03:35:31,790
you die to pinwheel that's all right that's not even a big deal why is that

1501
03:35:31,790 --> 03:35:37,110
some super unforgivable sin if you die to pinwheel in Dark Souls what if you

1502
03:35:37,110 --> 03:35:41,950
happen to have like an itchy ass when you go into the encounter I don't know

1503
03:35:41,950 --> 03:35:45,030
maybe you put your controller down because you didn't the cutscene came up

1504
03:35:45,030 --> 03:35:57,680
and you went to go grab like a snack or cheese it's or something maybe you just

1505
03:35:57,680 --> 03:36:20,729
got unlucky and you just got hit I don't know it's not such a good deal they

1506
03:36:20,729 --> 03:36:43,350
didn't even have a chance it's not like losing to the divine dragon Roberto can't

1507
03:36:43,350 --> 03:36:52,440
help you investigate this any I don't this part I don't understand this who

1508
03:36:52,440 --> 03:36:57,319
can help me investigate these things do you have to be like a water monster or

1509
03:36:57,319 --> 03:37:04,860
something I'm just gonna let Prover get hit in the head in this next encounter

1510
03:37:04,860 --> 03:37:27,790
mushroom where's a mushroom Prover can't help you with that I don't think anybody

1511
03:37:27,790 --> 03:37:49,399
can what about Roberto Roberto can't help you with that Prover is the

1512
03:37:49,399 --> 03:38:08,450
healings room what oh look how good you are actually kind of good he's got very

1513
03:38:08,450 --> 03:38:35,620
high intelligence and it's poison got a teddy bear the bunny can't fit in there

1514
03:38:35,620 --> 03:38:46,209
I don't think mushroom obtained silver coin yeah we tried to put put the bunny

1515
03:38:46,209 --> 03:38:58,370
in there last time nobody can do anything with that can you give the

1516
03:38:58,370 --> 03:39:13,229
teddy bear to my little brother no it's mine you see those video clips of the

1517
03:39:13,229 --> 03:39:18,290
baseball home runs where this is some buddy sitting next to a little kid and

1518
03:39:18,290 --> 03:39:24,409
the big home run Wow and the guy or girl whatever reaches over like the kid

1519
03:39:24,409 --> 03:39:33,569
and grabs the home run and cheers and doesn't give it to the kid that's what I

1520
03:39:33,569 --> 03:39:54,159
do isn't that part of a Will Ferrell movie probably yeah soon I caught it I

1521
03:39:54,159 --> 03:40:01,860
caught the ball I caught the ball I did I did it no no you cannot have the

1522
03:40:01,899 --> 03:40:27,000
ball no it's my ball no probably something like that yeah you probably

1523
03:40:27,000 --> 03:40:40,430
root for the Red Sox so it makes sense all sports fans of the same sports fans

1524
03:40:40,430 --> 03:41:09,239
as Jerry Seinfeld once said you're rooting for laundry god damn it I should

1525
03:41:09,239 --> 03:41:26,149
be trying to level them up anyways no of course you want to support your team

1526
03:41:26,149 --> 03:41:32,360
right I like the Red Sox because they grew up in the area and they had a

1527
03:41:32,360 --> 03:41:47,520
stadium it's fun to go to games and hey this is the team where I live I think

1528
03:41:47,520 --> 03:41:53,040
wrestling is wrestling now I don't think is cooler but the idea of wrestling is

1529
03:41:53,040 --> 03:41:57,120
cooler I think because it's a theater show where they actually like to hurt

1530
03:41:57,120 --> 03:42:04,590
each other kind of and there's like like a big in baseball if they were like

1531
03:42:04,590 --> 03:42:10,799
dramatic story arcs where you know at one point the center fielder got like

1532
03:42:10,799 --> 03:42:16,120
kidnapped or something and an old guy with like a vase came out and halfway

1533
03:42:16,120 --> 03:42:19,920
through the fourth inning like resurrected the center fielder or

1534
03:42:19,920 --> 03:42:26,879
something I imagine there was like the wacky bullshit from wrestling in

1535
03:42:26,879 --> 03:42:35,819
baseball and football yeah turns out I don't know what happened the entire

1536
03:42:35,819 --> 03:42:43,040
outfield is not here we haven't seen the entire outfield in two straight days but

1537
03:42:43,040 --> 03:42:45,959
they're gonna play the game anyways and it's just the infield and they there's

1538
03:42:45,959 --> 03:42:49,639
like fly balls going over their heads and shit and then finally after like four

1539
03:42:49,639 --> 03:42:55,760
of like a five maybe six innings it cuts to backstage of the outfielders coming

1540
03:42:55,760 --> 03:43:01,049
into the stadium they're getting into the outfielders here they are they made

1541
03:43:01,049 --> 03:43:10,780
into the stadium and then a car drives and runs two of them over the car who

1542
03:43:10,780 --> 03:43:18,010
is that it's like the manager of the other team oh my god oh that's Bill

1543
03:43:18,049 --> 03:43:29,010
Broski the third base coach for the Orioles and then the one outfielder has

1544
03:43:29,010 --> 03:43:38,239
to play every position imagine if the wrestling weird shit was in other sports

1545
03:43:38,239 --> 03:43:47,489
instead of the pitcher walking from the bullpen they like how do you like an

1546
03:43:47,489 --> 03:43:52,840
elaborate entrance he like comes up from the ground and this like fire around the

1547
03:43:52,840 --> 03:44:06,969
mound like gangrel used to do back in the attitude error he drinks from a

1548
03:44:06,969 --> 03:44:23,180
goblet of blood that's a gangrel used to do that where the hell is this

1549
03:44:23,180 --> 03:44:31,350
mushroom and all of them instead of special moves they had special they'd

1550
03:44:31,350 --> 03:44:37,420
know they still had their finishing moves but it was weird pitches and wacky

1551
03:44:37,420 --> 03:44:42,500
baseball like batting stances and you knew when he did the weird fucked up

1552
03:44:42,500 --> 03:44:49,739
stance it was his finishing move and you might hit a home run here the pitcher

1553
03:44:49,739 --> 03:44:52,540
changes their windup to be their finishing move wind up and it's like

1554
03:44:52,540 --> 03:45:11,489
here it is the quirky ball this is just making the Mario games real life as of

1555
03:45:11,489 --> 03:45:25,909
what it is Mario Baseball is just what I'm describing Mario Super Slugger but

1556
03:45:25,909 --> 03:45:54,479
wouldn't that be fun scream it scream what baseball somebody asked earlier

1557
03:45:54,520 --> 03:46:01,969
what's with all the violent sports references what what are you talking

1558
03:46:01,969 --> 03:46:09,979
about yeah they'd have like weird special

1559
03:46:09,979 --> 03:46:12,659
abilities like I know like we're talking about Mario sluggers but imagine if

1560
03:46:12,659 --> 03:46:20,860
somebody was like this really like decrepit small old man came up to the

1561
03:46:20,860 --> 03:46:29,450
mound it's like oh here it is this is old man yeah people I don't know what

1562
03:46:29,450 --> 03:46:34,610
I couldn't I couldn't think of a name he comes up and he gets to the mound and

1563
03:46:34,610 --> 03:46:37,409
everyone's like oh wait that's who this guy sucks like who's this guy's terrible

1564
03:46:37,409 --> 03:46:42,530
and he pulls up well you know everyone knows of course old man people's got the

1565
03:46:42,530 --> 03:46:47,250
cannon he sucks himself but he's got a great item he gets on the mound and he

1566
03:46:47,250 --> 03:46:51,170
loads the baseball into the cannon and it's like shoots into the catcher's

1567
03:46:51,170 --> 03:47:05,040
minute like 7,000 miles per hour the catcher would have to just get out of

1568
03:47:05,040 --> 03:47:13,760
the way no the catcher gets a special item too that's why you have these two

1569
03:47:13,760 --> 03:47:17,760
guys work together one of your catchers has like a metal plate for a catcher's

1570
03:47:17,760 --> 03:47:27,659
minute and he does like a wicked comedy stance when he loads the thing and does

1571
03:47:27,659 --> 03:47:33,899
the lights the fuse he likes if using that jumps back and goes puts his

1572
03:47:33,899 --> 03:47:54,360
fingers both fingers in his ears and crouches down everyone screams old man

1573
03:47:54,360 --> 03:48:02,290
no no no he's just he just screams crouches down it's gotta be a loud one

1574
03:48:02,290 --> 03:48:18,729
Mario Kart double-dash but with WWE wrestlers didn't they do that already

1575
03:48:19,959 --> 03:48:28,270
energize obtains cave search really doesn't move to have to learn yeah they

1576
03:48:28,270 --> 03:48:38,559
already did that yeah i streamed that game i forgot that's true i that was as

1577
03:48:38,559 --> 03:48:52,159
well that was a stream on this channel i genuinely thought that you made the

1578
03:48:52,159 --> 03:49:17,639
gnome video for a while what i did too i no i didn't uh 10 community subs just

1579
03:49:17,639 --> 03:49:28,969
came in from pin man thank you for the 10 community stuff big sub drop thank

1580
03:49:28,969 --> 03:49:42,600
you that was quick i think i'll probably get to level 8 after this one maybe i'll

1581
03:49:42,600 --> 03:49:55,770
learn something new something at level 8 a new trait new passive there it is

1582
03:49:55,770 --> 03:50:08,030
Roberto mastered midair midair midair is that his finisher

1583
03:50:08,030 --> 03:50:27,760
mid holy shit life damage s accuracy a this is what i'm using now what is this

1584
03:50:27,760 --> 03:50:37,600
is short range takes almost my entire guts meter takes 50 guts so it has to go

1585
03:50:37,600 --> 03:50:44,540
in this short range slot but holy crap that's i have to put it i'm gonna

1586
03:50:44,540 --> 03:50:51,520
replace kick we're gonna try this out i'm actually i'm gonna do this too i'm

1587
03:50:51,520 --> 03:50:58,239
gonna put charge down here i'm gonna put turn slash here i'm gonna put regular

1588
03:50:58,239 --> 03:51:05,120
slash here and then midair here

1589
03:51:12,280 --> 03:51:24,440
let's see what this does it says the highest damage you can possibly have for

1590
03:51:24,440 --> 03:51:32,190
a move in the game and one of the highest accuracy ratings let's see how it

1591
03:51:34,030 --> 03:51:50,000
is midair wow uh oh i don't know if uh i don't know if it's possible for me to

1592
03:51:50,000 --> 03:51:58,600
lose i think i will take this character to s or at least a ranking and wipe the

1593
03:51:58,600 --> 03:52:04,920
floor with everyone because that move potentially will doesn't matter even a

1594
03:52:04,920 --> 03:52:11,870
high health pool it's over 200 220 250 health is a lot of health that's an

1595
03:52:11,870 --> 03:52:20,110
instant kill move and it's one of the most accurate in the game rose perfume

1608
03:55:12,379 --> 03:55:17,100

1615
03:56:26,540 --> 03:56:32,860
that move is going to be incredible and then under incredible undodgeable

1616
03:56:34,219 --> 03:56:37,100

1627
03:58:15,959 --> 03:58:21,319
and an excellent fighter if anybody deserves a breeder's license it's you but the real world

1628
03:58:21,319 --> 03:58:28,940
is not a simple place so listen to my proposal first i ask of you a favor have you heard of the

1629
03:58:28,940 --> 03:58:34,700
kalaragi jungle well it's a very odd place the jungle is littered with these gadget thingies

1630
03:58:34,700 --> 03:58:41,579
well more like junk and i want to investigate them would you please retrieve the junk then

1631
03:58:41,579 --> 03:58:52,680
if you pass a little test i'll give you your license what do you think hey hard to believe

1632
03:58:52,680 --> 03:58:58,030
he's a high ranking association member teehee well how about it fein are you ready to take

1633
03:58:58,030 --> 03:59:02,639
on the challenge of course explore the jungle and pick up the junk

1634
03:59:02,639 --> 03:59:17,600
oh uh guys i was never soft-locked i had to press x

1635
03:59:25,629 --> 03:59:28,559
so apparently there's that

1636
03:59:31,319 --> 03:59:42,620
need food all right we want i need more carrots

1637
03:59:45,340 --> 03:59:53,420
five of them everybody wants potatoes anymore mangoes everybody likes mangoes get tennies

1638
03:59:56,510 --> 04:00:17,260
library who cares all right now we have to do more jungle exploring with a new adventure

1639
04:00:17,260 --> 04:00:26,299
unlocked probably gonna be harder it's all right so this is fein's ranch hmm okay here i go

1640
04:00:27,520 --> 04:00:34,600
hello there what are you doing here oh uh well i wanted to thank you for the other day so

1641
04:00:36,379 --> 04:00:42,959
shoot you don't have to thank us no i do and about the battles in ruin you better learn new

1642
04:00:42,959 --> 04:00:49,920
battle techniques if you don't learn counters you'll have a hard time i wanted to warn you

1643
04:00:51,739 --> 04:01:14,590
counters what kind of ability is that time to learn a counter the counter when an opponent

1644
04:01:14,590 --> 04:01:22,520
attacks hold the l2 button then push the button you think they used i'll use an x button move

1645
04:01:22,920 --> 04:01:43,399
uh so i have to guess what button they're pressing but what do you mean x yeah but you can also change

1646
04:01:43,399 --> 04:01:54,540
skills by pushing different buttons try performing a skill with the o button yes with the o button

1647
04:01:54,540 --> 04:02:01,340
you perform a skill precisely damage is lowered but you may contact more often next try performing

1648
04:02:01,340 --> 04:02:17,360
a skill with the square button to perform a skill with force what how did we not hear know this

1649
04:02:17,360 --> 04:02:26,270
before why is the tutorial for this yeah why is it halfway through the game it's not halfway

1650
04:02:26,270 --> 04:02:35,850
through the game so circle is force does a lot of damage x button yeah that's what i've been doing

1651
04:02:35,850 --> 04:02:49,100
this whole time what does that do i've been doing every single move with x that's a no okay normally

1652
04:02:50,399 --> 04:02:52,239
try using the x again to perform a skill

1653
04:02:53,040 --> 04:03:23,879
so i have to guess at what button they press and okay thanks well fooey you get away from him girl

1654
04:03:25,520 --> 04:03:28,879
huh tt you came all this way geez lay off and go home

1655
04:03:31,209 --> 04:03:38,159
you sure are charming you must think you're king of the world today i'll show you who's a real boss

1656
04:03:38,159 --> 04:03:45,200
around here get your pesky assistant and prepare yourselves oh boy well okay let's make it a tag

1657
04:03:45,200 --> 04:04:02,540
battle let's see what you got tag battle that mechanic is the whole reason i dislike this game

1658
04:04:04,559 --> 04:04:11,420
i've had so many victories snatched away in s rank because of that oh all right we're going

1659
04:04:11,420 --> 04:04:24,700
up against your garbage and calorino okay time to learn about tag battles first the tag how to

1660
04:04:24,700 --> 04:04:32,350
switch monsters i've done before try this l1 l1 tag out now you've switched in tag battles you

1661
04:04:32,350 --> 04:04:43,530
were able to use partnership powers take a deep breath stay still and wait team up there now your

1662
04:04:43,530 --> 04:04:50,840
partnership power is charged now you can carry out a chase attack while your partnership power

1663
04:04:50,840 --> 04:04:57,530
is rising the skill panel turns red select the panel and use a skill after you perform a skill

1664
04:04:57,530 --> 04:05:09,180
the standby partner will do a chase attack so that all right so you have to have the team up

1665
04:05:09,819 --> 04:05:29,020
did we even we didn't even play why you you have the nerve to use combinations on me

1666
04:05:31,639 --> 04:05:37,260
this is just the pits i'm going home counters and tag moves this is so cool thanks philia

1667
04:05:38,379 --> 04:05:43,760
not at all i'm glad you like them well see you around fain best of luck i can't wait to use

1668
04:05:43,760 --> 04:05:51,069
those on you because you're going to be the champion of the next area and i'm going to use

1669
04:05:52,190 --> 04:05:56,829
tag maneuvers on you and you're going to be like i can't believe i told you that i told you those

1670
04:05:56,829 --> 04:06:22,360
things all right so we can do let me see no official tournaments so i i'm gonna i'm gonna

04:07:48,600 --> 04:07:58,350
hungry you are well it's you just are they friends they might not be friends to combine

1698
04:13:16,540 --> 04:13:25,229
i don't have a cdr or anything but i have a question is it possible for me to burn over this

1699
04:13:26,280 --> 04:13:44,780
this is just a disc right can i just delete this and burn over it there's no way oh well

1700
04:13:44,780 --> 04:14:14,559
it's read only read only memory so this is from the ring thank you for waiting

1701
04:14:25,610 --> 04:14:28,569
no shroom no shroom no shroom and no rumor either

1702
04:14:48,319 --> 04:15:15,000
well let's put alias in here this is playstation 2 i think it actually might be the dreamcast

1703
04:15:15,000 --> 04:15:43,399
curse yeah it's just dreamcast i don't i didn't want to believe it but now i do alias something

1704
04:15:43,399 --> 04:16:04,989
give me a new seed let's see something awesome something that i'll be proud to level up after

1705
04:16:04,989 --> 04:16:22,250
this we'll do jackass the game um all right what the hell is this it's a skull flower

1706
04:16:25,200 --> 04:16:35,500
not a mushroom let's i'll take a look at it it's the mushroom but it's dead

1707
04:16:43,579 --> 04:16:55,389
the unprover unprover doomer i like the unprover i don't think it'll fit though

1708
04:16:59,790 --> 04:17:03,629
so

1709
04:17:04,750 --> 04:17:09,149
now it doesn't fit

1710
04:17:18,319 --> 04:17:19,360
unprover

1711
04:17:26,350 --> 04:17:37,399
i can do the actual word but i can't do two o's the way that you want unprover i can do unprover

1712
04:17:42,399 --> 04:18:03,000
the unprover unprover isn't a word yeah i know unprover try another stone this is jackass what

1713
04:18:03,000 --> 04:18:10,590
does that word mean that means that you are um if you're a prover that means you're proving

1714
04:18:10,590 --> 04:18:19,870
something no fuck it whatever so an unprover uh this is that's weird to understand explain i

1715
04:18:19,870 --> 04:18:26,829
know what it means but i can't explain what it means does that make sense it means that you are

1716
04:18:26,829 --> 04:18:32,329
supposed to be somebody that can prove things but you're not being able to prove anything

1717
04:18:32,329 --> 04:18:36,729
you're a disprover but you're unproving things it's i i can't explain it you guys know what i mean

1718
04:18:36,729 --> 04:19:00,139
so debunk no no but he's the prover that's his name his name is the prover the unprover

1719
04:19:01,479 --> 04:19:05,079
at that i mean we're not using that's not the terminology like proving something

1720
04:19:05,079 --> 04:19:18,729
it's his actual name he's the prover guys it's a proverb thank you

1721
04:19:18,729 --> 04:20:21,049

character that's true he's good 163 base stats at just being born is really actually pretty good

1736
04:24:31,340 --> 04:24:43,450
147 power 163 and just mash intellect and um accuracy and can be used for a fusion later as

1737
04:24:43,450 --> 04:24:52,799
well this is true all right um let's get them in let's get them into the uh let's go intellect

1738
04:24:52,799 --> 04:25:09,000
and uh accuracy oh maybe i'll just hammer accuracy for a little while let's hammer accuracy

1739
04:25:11,399 --> 04:25:22,799
and then uh rest we'll bring up uh intelligence book gonna be a smart dragon

1740
04:25:22,799 --> 04:25:28,969
again rest and we'll go to

1741
04:25:31,770 --> 04:25:35,290
more accuracy and we'll take a look at it after that all right you on the other hand

1742
04:25:36,409 --> 04:25:49,360
what do you need uh defense and intelligence maybe you kind of need a lot of things intelligence

1743
04:25:49,360 --> 04:25:56,520
and accuracy defense and speed maybe defense in life i'm gonna say defense in life for now

1744
04:26:03,879 --> 04:26:25,690
okay and then we'll take a look at it afterwards there will be the book it's an int now you on the

1745
04:26:25,690 --> 04:26:33,770
other hand you're doing just fine but you also need to rest here and then we'll do power let's

1746
04:26:33,770 --> 04:26:48,969
take a look here we go that's a lot for being zero years old unprover didn't do very well what

1747
04:26:48,969 --> 04:27:03,659
does this dragon like to eat good job save i'll save i'll save i'll save i'll save i'll save

1749
04:27:18,430 --> 04:27:25,340

1750
04:27:25,340 --> 04:27:32,909
can just carry everybody free experience free exp i mean maybe Roberto should just go

1751
04:27:35,229 --> 04:28:04,040
i'll save yeah save first okay Roberto's so much better than everyone else yeah but he's also a

1752
04:28:04,040 --> 04:28:11,760
lot older think of it this way if i do three or four weeks of intelligence with the dragon

1753
04:28:14,909 --> 04:28:22,940
there'll be over 200 intelligence that's pretty great actually all right target sandbag and

1754
04:28:22,940 --> 04:28:37,870
lifeblade game is saved and we'll take everybody into the jungle after this i'll tell you though

1755
04:28:37,870 --> 04:28:48,219
he's got really really good stat uh stat adding usually it takes him to like at least six months

1756
04:28:48,219 --> 04:29:00,879
before they start getting that much so he'll be really good stat adding okay what does he eat

1757
04:29:00,879 --> 04:29:15,629
though are you gonna be mad if i give you like a carrot is that thank you or is that no thank you

1758
04:29:16,270 --> 04:29:34,479

1761
04:30:00,700 --> 04:30:08,729

1767
04:31:32,510 --> 04:31:39,850
let's find out so there's a fish type that's funny what is wind war

1768
04:31:44,489 --> 04:31:50,969
ups wind and fire power and lets you add a wind power to skill you still don't get how that works

1769
04:31:57,319 --> 04:32:07,260
you combine Roberto and the dragon and get a metal dragon that would be crazy well i got an

1770
04:32:07,260 --> 04:32:33,020
intelligence stone whatever that means help for your information yeah i know i know i've read it

1771
04:32:33,020 --> 04:32:57,100
the first time that's so good i'm gonna play with a spiroid for a little bit try to get him some

1772
04:32:57,100 --> 04:33:30,810
levels am i using square i'm just using x at the moment that system's kind of weird forward i bring

1773
04:33:30,810 --> 04:33:48,729
up the dragon what the hell are you guys doing over here now you know but you know the car when

1774
04:33:48,729 --> 04:33:53,720
you're driving the car you know there's a i know the gas pedal but there's also a brake

1775
04:33:57,900 --> 04:34:01,979
you've not maybe you might well put your foot on the brake and just gently put your foot on it and

1776
04:34:01,979 --> 04:34:19,319
press it a little uh-huh and do a drift hey as long as you start to slow down a little

1777
04:34:19,319 --> 04:34:36,599
come on where's the stuff this stuff here can i touch anything with the bushes or anything no

1778
04:34:37,639 --> 04:35:05,840
i want to see what the fire looks like what is that thing spiroids let's see fire that is such

1779
04:35:05,840 --> 04:35:26,360
a weird monster seriously holy shit this thing's amazing real shit just got real probably should

1780
04:35:26,360 --> 04:35:38,750
try to counter that that was awesome so you gotta do those quick and guess it correctly so you have

1781
04:35:38,750 --> 04:35:46,270
a one in three chance to get that right and you have to do it fast got him the anime move

1782
04:35:48,409 --> 04:36:00,919
hard skin and detail level up a couple more times see if i can get another move or two there

1783
04:36:01,880 --> 04:36:12,110
it doesn't very much help but Roberto carry um can somebody dig

1784
04:36:14,270 --> 04:36:23,159
can spyroid dig actually no you have to learn it don't you yeah something you learn by leveling up

1785
04:36:33,279 --> 04:36:43,119
burn that's big let's go big on it power move real i don't know what that even means

1786
04:36:44,000 --> 04:36:58,599
he blocked it blocked it again he's bullish uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh he's gotta hit it here

1787
04:36:59,479 --> 04:37:42,830
uh-oh i missed well jackass dragon oh well how are you still here well he was just bullish half

1788
04:37:42,830 --> 04:37:59,979
the time nice dodge he's that counter now you're dead lower lifespan well he shouldn't have missed

1789
04:37:59,979 --> 04:38:20,490
four of the moves i tried well what does bullish even mean like stupid it means stubborn

1790
04:38:21,049 --> 04:38:41,659
well don't be so stubborn otherwise it's gonna get you killed he learned he'll figure it out

1791
04:38:42,220 --> 04:39:03,470
he's just a baby i know what bullish means bullish in like a stock market term is not

1792
04:39:03,470 --> 04:39:10,490
what they mean in this game it's like a financial term that they're not like oh things are looking

1793
04:39:10,490 --> 04:39:25,709
bullish not this again i didn't say it i didn't bring it up i tried to fight to stop it from

1794
04:39:25,709 --> 04:40:00,400
happening nothing how can i cross this oh almost got the teenage mutant ninja turtles

1795
04:40:01,880 --> 04:40:31,659
boss character ah this thing almost level 10 so it's not this way wherever this random junk

1796
04:40:31,659 --> 04:40:55,400
that this guy wants is not here this would be level 10 hopefully we get something good at level

1797
04:40:55,400 --> 04:41:15,900
10 actually countered it unbelievable dude all right so it's just turned this is this just turned

1798
04:41:15,900 --> 04:41:40,509
into a guessing game yes really oh come on if you don't try to counter you can still block it

1799
04:41:41,310 --> 04:41:51,599
welcome to the reason why i said go back to two well we're already this invested

1800
04:41:51,599 --> 04:42:00,779
magic lore for Roberto unprover obtained sniper Roberto mastered air shot and unprover has slap

1801
04:42:00,779 --> 04:42:21,389
now air shot what is air shot air shot accuracy a so it's an intelligence move was it like a

1802
04:42:21,950 --> 04:42:28,959
moonlit sword move that's a lot of guts damage i think that's the highest guts damage thing i have

1803
04:42:29,599 --> 04:42:34,360
yep so this is a far range i can put it pretty much anywhere

1804
04:42:37,819 --> 04:42:45,799
so my intelligence is terrible though and i also got the magic lore helps magic power

1805
04:42:48,490 --> 04:42:55,599
uh what about the other unprover got pecking slap

1806
04:42:57,740 --> 04:43:05,819
slap is a accuracy much better accuracy but does barely any damage uh this is kind of just uh

1807
04:43:06,779 --> 04:43:11,630
light move to maybe get one last tap in for them to guess and uh block it

1808
04:43:15,759 --> 04:43:39,400
all right let me find this thing great now the other baby is gonna die no he's not check it

1809
04:43:39,400 --> 04:43:51,049
no if he gets hit once Roberto's coming well Roberto's coming Roberto we'll get it

1810
04:43:53,310 --> 04:44:04,430
let's try it air shot that's pretty cool if you know if you have to zone somebody up oh fuck

1811
04:44:07,000 --> 04:44:19,500
don't let that happen i could get out of here they're almost dead this is bad i don't want to

1812
04:44:19,500 --> 04:44:29,689
lose any more health i hope it's in this box they're not prepared for this yet oh shit oh no

1813
04:44:52,590 --> 04:45:01,229
all right i need to get to the menu i need to sort first before this happens

1814
04:45:02,029 --> 04:45:08,430
put Roberto up front because otherwise he's gonna get hit and die item do i have anything

1815
04:45:08,430 --> 04:45:16,169
thing no oh use when combining to regenerate a monster with higher intelligence that's pretty

1816
04:45:16,169 --> 04:45:28,119
cool all right please be in here toy junk get me out of here before somebody dies

1877
04:58:09,229 --> 04:58:16,119
but let's go let's continue for like another couple hours we've got

1878
04:58:19,000 --> 04:58:26,880

1880
04:58:48,040 --> 04:58:58,560
he's only we gotta get him up there now so much power some let's get over 200 accuracy

1881
04:58:59,580 --> 04:59:07,740
and then i'm gonna move into once he gets over like 220 accuracy i think we'll split it between

1882
04:59:08,700 --> 04:59:14,599
power and speed or power in life power indeed probably power in life maybe a little bit of

1883
04:59:14,599 --> 04:59:27,479
defense so he's resting today he's gonna do get that yeah we'll do two let's get the rest of the

1884
04:59:28,840 --> 04:59:31,159
accuracy out of the way try to get like 220 240

1885
04:59:33,759 --> 04:59:39,759
and then power power and we'll take a look after that you on the other hand you're doing book book

1886
04:59:39,759 --> 04:59:50,430

1890
05:00:23,340 --> 05:00:37,799
two hours ago i did drink a full glass of water before i came back up here he's lying no that's

1891
05:00:37,799 --> 05:00:53,080
not a lie that's for real everybody's working today there we go two more accuracy and we should

1892
05:00:53,080 --> 05:00:59,950
be good to go with accuracy until probably rank like a i would assume to give you some food good

1893
05:00:59,950 --> 05:01:32,970
job first of all and carry please die already Roberto why are you saying that really ban that

1894
05:01:32,970 --> 05:02:02,680
guy a dragon that eats carrots i need to get meat almost there to do potentially the official cup

1895
05:02:02,680 --> 05:02:09,279
is to go get the junk i'm sure everybody has something to do today yeah no you don't need to

1896
05:02:09,279 --> 05:02:28,909
rest back to the book then rest you no don't rest you're fine target target target you

1897
05:02:30,430 --> 05:02:47,040

1898
05:02:47,840 --> 05:02:58,189
it's pretty good pretty good pretty good all right you now need to press

1899
05:03:00,990 --> 05:03:03,790
i swear these little flower guys eat more than anybody else

1900
05:03:08,409 --> 05:03:13,740
the mushrooms and the flowers eat way more you you you eat more food than the dragon does

1901
05:03:14,380 --> 05:03:29,080
how makes no sense all right now everybody seems to be this is a day of rest

1902
05:03:29,080 --> 05:03:52,750
rest rest rest anybody feeling down everybody good lively let's give you something to eat too

1903

a mango this time this is like a little snack okay you're good lively lively and you're all good

1904
05:04:09,770 --> 05:04:16,299
a little bit more training

1905
05:04:24,909 --> 05:04:31,529
so let's get you into the accuracy right but i want to do one more

1906
05:04:33,369 --> 05:04:37,770
let's get you into the book again and then you into the light blade

1907
05:04:41,919 --> 05:04:53,610
pretty great gains Roberto should be fine now for accuracy for a while he's probably over to 22 30

1908
05:05:03,979 --> 05:05:10,919
and let's also good work

1909
05:05:20,000 --> 05:05:28,029
okay everybody's all right what we got for competitions something's coming up right

1910
05:05:29,819 --> 05:05:38,330
yeah cup of more weeks Roberto has this that'll give him enough to actually compete

1911
05:05:38,330 --> 05:05:55,950
and bring him up to here to be so let's see let's block out the week here so we got let's do

1912
05:05:58,349 --> 05:06:04,889
a sandbag and then maybe a rest here yeah let's say sandbag and then rest he should be good to go

1913
05:06:04,889 --> 05:06:10,650
and then we'll from there going forward we're going to do power and life or power and defense

1914
05:06:11,610 --> 05:06:17,310
you need some more accuracy yes you do and health is fine for both of you good for

1915
05:06:29,200 --> 05:06:36,119
all right you can relax now what's with the gross plant get rumor back

1916

1917
05:07:01,279 --> 05:07:11,470

1918
05:07:12,189 --> 05:07:29,319

05:08:04,009 --> 05:08:22,909
that oh you're tired all right you're yeah uh i'm sorry but roberto is the last one i have to win

1922
05:08:23,869 --> 05:08:35,279
don't feed your monster potatoes it's the worst food in the whole game even if the monster likes

1923
05:08:35,279 --> 05:08:47,680
it well i actually haven't been i truly have not been i've been given to mangoes and carrots and

1924
05:08:47,680 --> 05:08:58,919
bananas all right shouldn't be too much of a problem everybody in c rank seems to be just

1925
05:08:58,919 --> 05:09:09,200
across the board 180 190 on every step we saw that weird monster with 482 intelligence that time

1926
05:09:10,240 --> 05:09:11,040
made no sense

1927
05:09:22,990 --> 05:09:34,540
i'll just bully you forever i want to spray that flower with roundup oh my god easy

1928
05:09:39,080 --> 05:09:45,279
he already is dark dead how do you kill which that is already dead

1929
05:09:47,439 --> 05:10:08,959
my power with fire that's not a good start

1930
05:10:08,959 --> 05:10:23,819
all right look at that damage look at that damage he's unstoppable unbeatable immutable

1931
05:10:24,619 --> 05:10:38,729
unbelievable irreplaceable irredeemable undeniable this is versus push

1932
05:10:40,540 --> 05:11:15,819
oh 232 with insane accuracy just kill it fast kill it fast aesthetic that's not good

1933
05:11:22,650 --> 05:11:52,000
again quick thank god that yeah nice game mechanic that actually sucks i can't fucking

1934
05:11:52,000 --> 05:11:56,959
wait for Roberto to win again jesus christ that arrogant fuck thinks he's so fucking tough

1935
05:11:57,520 --> 05:12:02,560
of picking on unprepared ai's what a load of shit what's the point of having attorney

1959
05:16:19,290 --> 05:16:48,380

1960
05:16:59,819 --> 05:17:07,119
everyone's good let's find the junk in the jungle let's bring everybody let's just farm experience

1961
05:17:07,119 --> 05:17:24,220
for these two start exploring so i didn't do this last time somehow i found the end

1962
05:17:24,299 --> 05:17:25,659
but i need to find the junk

1963
05:17:28,509 --> 05:18:02,040
i guess time is cubic no time is a circle the earth is a circle the snake eating itself

1964
05:18:05,759 --> 05:18:21,040
the oreboreus is a circle pizza is a circle your brain is a circle your head is a circle

1965
05:18:21,040 --> 05:18:39,770
the pills i just took that make me think this strangely shaped like a circle everything just

1966
05:18:39,770 --> 05:18:58,830
circle man the casino chips they're a circle the earth is a circle the moon is a circle the sun is

1967
05:18:58,830 --> 05:19:26,000
a circle 87 chance to hit now i think that's fine final guts it up now don't do drugs it's

1968
05:19:26,000 --> 05:19:43,470
fucking bad for you don't be crazy don't be an idiot tylenol okay i'm gonna list you the drugs

1969
05:19:43,470 --> 05:20:07,450

1970
05:20:21,369 --> 05:20:31,709
level 11 what do i get genius he's now a genius this one you thought Roberto couldn't get any

1971
05:20:31,709 --> 05:20:44,599
better genius increases intelligence attacks but strength attacks damage easily what can i turn

1972
05:20:44,599 --> 05:20:59,369
this off i don't know what does this mean but strength attacks damage easily i get hurt more

1973
05:20:59,369 --> 05:21:13,759
by strength that's terrible oh somebody can dig right who can dig straight down

1974
05:21:14,560 --> 05:21:36,430
uh unprover right i think so investigate it unprover couldn't find anything what good

1975
05:21:37,150 --> 05:21:38,750
are you gonna give me here man come on

1976
05:22:02,380 --> 05:22:18,990
this game looks like a fake game that an extra would be playing in a movie uh spyroid obtained

1977
05:22:19,069 --> 05:22:22,110
big lung i got toy glasses

1978
05:22:33,689 --> 05:22:34,729
it's very funny

1979
05:22:37,770 --> 05:22:45,740
is it a trait big lung increases power of moves that expel breath so fire

1980
05:22:51,159 --> 05:22:55,959
a fake game that the extra is playing in the movie somewhere in the background

1981
05:22:56,680 --> 05:23:41,200
you don't even get a chance sit down germa subs you are a germa sub all right junk

1982
05:23:48,139 --> 05:23:58,200
junk yes obtained junk toy that's it right that's what he wanted is germa sub to germa yes but

1983
05:23:58,200 --> 05:24:05,959
germa is sub to germa because germa is germa is germa so therefore it just gets a badge next to

1984
05:24:05,959 --> 05:24:19,450
their name i thought that was a monster i just get a sub to my own channel but it's not i don't

1985
05:24:19,450 --> 05:24:29,080
have to pay for it it's just there i didn't do anything i just have it wait was there something

1986
05:24:29,080 --> 05:24:43,000
over here that i just walked by no imagine subbing to germa see to that the person just said that

1987
05:24:43,000 --> 05:24:51,369
and they're not subscribed so they can say that i mean it's rude exceptionally rude but we're not

1988
05:24:51,369 --> 05:25:25,040
going to talk about that we're just talking about facts i don't know the toy is not the junk that i

1989
05:25:25,040 --> 05:25:32,759
need did you wave your hands and fingers across while you said that in a kind british accent

1990
05:25:34,759 --> 05:25:38,119
and with their twinkle sounds made and my eyes kind of glazed over

1991
05:25:39,159 --> 05:26:13,840
that is what i'm looking for where is this thing star wars is too old kids don't get that reference

1992
05:26:14,240 --> 05:26:26,040
what one just came out like a year ago that was the biggest hit 334

1993
05:26:27,639 --> 05:26:48,479
all right unprover leveled up flower dance didn't oh no that was the mushroom why are

1994
05:26:48,479 --> 05:26:58,599
mushrooms just flowers in this game i don't bunny anymore do i no we iced the bunny

1995
05:27:03,880 --> 05:27:18,439
and apparently no apparently you can't cut for this with your sword somehow like digimon world

1996
05:27:18,919 --> 05:27:39,799
that is digimon world is that like an mmo the massive multiplayer game or something

1997
05:27:50,540 --> 05:27:58,909
this should even exist in this game please have this be it that's a document 10

1998
05:28:03,529 --> 05:28:12,779
it's a playstation 1 game it's like this but you explore a world with your monster rancher friend

1999
05:28:13,659 --> 05:28:34,279
i can't progress anymore i have to go all the way around it's one of my favorite games

2000
05:28:34,360 --> 05:28:40,650
i'll check it out am i looking for the mushrooms now i'm looking for this

2001
05:28:40,650 --> 05:28:45,290
specific junk that this guy wants so i can participate in the city tournament

2002
05:28:56,319 --> 05:29:07,630
digimon world is amazing but you hatch eggs it's like this and you get to watch your monsters poop

2003
05:29:07,630 --> 05:29:29,310
everywhere i love how that's a selling point that's perfect for you you definitely won't check it out

2004
05:29:29,310 --> 05:29:39,520
by the way well why wouldn't i just because i check it out doesn't mean i'm gonna play it

2005
05:29:39,520 --> 05:29:46,889
i'm gonna check it out that means i'm gonna open up a tab type in digimon world watch like a trailer

2006
05:29:47,529 --> 05:30:04,459
look up reviews and then decide you know what that sounds good feels so good when you insta kill

2007
05:30:05,259 --> 05:30:19,709
the fart streamer is judging a poop game we already talked about that why that wasn't the

2008
05:30:19,709 --> 05:30:49,930
reason why i thought that was so funny you're putting words in my ears that's fine yes words

2009
05:30:49,930 --> 05:30:56,799
in my ears you're currently putting words into my ears and i don't not like them i don't like

2010
05:30:56,799 --> 05:31:24,119
hearing them great wing probably trait great wing our moves that use the wings you guys don't have

2011
05:31:24,119 --> 05:31:30,990
the twitch integration uh better twitch.tv notification sound thing every time a line

2012
05:31:30,990 --> 05:31:41,000
of chat comes i can hear you guys because i want to make sure i know when a chat message comes

2013
05:31:41,000 --> 05:32:05,209
through every time almost level six for unprover i really don't know what this is

2014
05:32:07,450 --> 05:32:16,569
it's causing me anguish yeah i get an email every time there's a chat message twitch sends

2015

keen fang trample machine gun machine let me see what that looks like

2049
05:41:03,119 --> 05:41:10,889
so let's see machine gun critical hit rate is a all right maybe i'm not going to put you into

2050
05:41:10,889 --> 05:41:19,020
the friar lady again all right machine gun is long range so it takes 40 guts to do that

2051
05:41:19,020 --> 05:41:36,540
accuracy is terrible the dance flower dance it's a charm all right well let's uh get dirt search

2052
05:41:36,540 --> 05:41:43,500
already keen fang of course that's what it means uh you got something new too you got trample

2053
05:41:45,259 --> 05:41:54,060
uh this is really good tons of guts damage massive crit rating tons of damage

2054
05:41:54,060 --> 05:41:58,779
actual to health and not terrible accuracy takes 34 guts to do is it long range

2055
05:41:59,419 --> 05:42:11,000
uh this is my flutter is a super accurate move i'm not sure what this it might be a status effect

2056
05:42:12,759 --> 05:42:17,880
we also have detail trample uh detail

2057
05:42:21,880 --> 05:42:27,290
i guess i could put it on the last row flutter is a slow that's cool

2058
05:42:27,290 --> 05:43:13,479
what's the best breakfast food whoa this is your animal you got jigglypuff

2059
05:43:18,729 --> 05:43:23,689
we stole all your money well that would be impossible considering i don't have any money

2060
05:43:24,889 --> 05:43:33,369
every set that i make i buy gold bars and i scrape the gold into small baggies you just take a knife

2061
05:43:33,369 --> 05:43:40,009
and you scrape scrape scrape filings off into ziploc bags and i've stored them all over the world

2062
05:43:41,529 --> 05:43:59,500
only i know where they are everywhere in fact i i've done it so many times that i had originally

2063
05:43:59,500 --> 05:44:06,919
a treasure map that i was going to leave but over time i did it so often that the map got so confusing

2064
05:44:07,880 --> 05:44:14,889
that i don't even know where they are there was circles and x's and i had a globe and it's been

2065
05:44:14,889 --> 05:44:22,569
done eight nine thousand twelve hundred times i only know where two of them are and one of them's

2066
05:44:22,569 --> 05:44:34,840
under my bed but it's only like four dollars worth of gold the other one is under a tree

2067
05:44:34,840 --> 05:44:40,759

05:52:45,599 --> 05:52:51,520
it's coming up right i don't need to do this one i already did it so we're gonna this is four

2113
05:52:51,520 --> 05:52:58,400
thousand dollars a cake i think we'll be ready let's get some more life life twice rest and then

2114
05:52:58,400 --> 05:53:10,840
maybe let's see 342 power which is unmatched probably need a little bit more life and maybe

2115
05:53:10,840 --> 05:53:16,590
some more defense because i yeah i need more defense because i just got that stupid trait

2116
05:53:17,150 --> 05:53:30,240
that makes me take more damage from power attacks so defense and life let's just do life now

2117
05:53:31,720 --> 05:53:33,880
life rest life defense

2118
05:53:36,360 --> 05:53:44,959
probably defense probably rest well let's see this might be a little too much

2119
05:53:46,880 --> 05:54:04,830
target and then that's fine book and then we'll just see what it looks like i feel like i have

2120
05:54:04,830 --> 05:54:11,150
some speed otherwise a cc train is gonna hit you hard yeah that's true what is the speed

2121
05:54:11,869 --> 05:54:12,750
is pretty bad isn't it

2122
05:54:28,540 --> 05:54:32,380
i need more food too i will get that after the end of this

2123
05:54:38,540 --> 05:54:53,099
don't have any more food that you can eat um six mangoes so i got a little bit fine you're fine

2124
05:54:53,099 --> 05:55:02,110
you also need mango no wrong person come here i feel like very slowly without paying attention

2125
05:55:02,110 --> 05:55:18,360
he's getting really really really insane stats let me look he's coming along 200 intelligence

2126
05:55:19,659 --> 05:55:26,779
i need way more health and accuracy though is the act okay that might look bad at first glance

2127
05:55:26,779 --> 05:55:41,340
here but remember the accuracy was below 60 or something it was horrible he looks pretty good

2128
05:55:41,340 --> 05:55:48,799
too my intelligence i wish i could just skip tournaments because these guys have to fight

2129
05:55:48,799 --> 05:55:57,259
down at the e-rank but maybe not maybe i'll just keep them for exploring and just not even have

2130
05:55:57,259 --> 05:56:08,000
him just be the tournament one because it almost feels like that's too much to do

2131
05:56:12,639 --> 05:56:17,840
they're going for like three hours how's Roberto he's been pretty good

2132
05:56:22,840 --> 05:56:29,240
so you actually sell meat it's very expensive but you still sell it

2133
05:56:30,220 --> 05:56:41,040
beef 500 that's so much squid let's get a bunch of these and did i say that correctly that's

2134
05:56:41,119 --> 05:56:48,250
eating screws why would i feed screws to my animals

2135
05:56:52,349 --> 05:56:57,869
it seems kind of insane i'm gonna buy a couple of beefs just for the purpose of making sure

2136
05:56:59,630 --> 05:57:01,869
people are taken care of but get some more bananas

2137
05:57:04,750 --> 05:57:16,990
feed it to the robot should feed it up the robot a screw

2138
05:57:17,069 --> 05:57:42,319
oh robots don't eat screws they might okay here i am again long time no see and feign how do

2139
05:57:42,319 --> 05:57:48,720

06:00:47,580 --> 06:00:50,299
another single right which one of these is single this is

2159
06:00:57,950 --> 06:01:01,790
this that something else can go here

2160
06:01:01,790 --> 06:01:05,150
monster

2161
06:01:08,509 --> 06:01:11,150
sandbag book target what am i missing

2162
06:01:15,709 --> 06:01:17,549
that's it right yeah that's everything

2163
06:01:20,349 --> 06:01:42,509
all right five monsters can live in the hut oh god five more jesus or a five total

06:01:44,349 --> 06:01:53,500
this is gonna get overwhelming here all right rest tub right when is the official tournament

2165
06:01:53,500 --> 06:02:01,610

2166
06:02:04,250 --> 06:02:12,060
uh rest for everybody rest rest rest and we'll take a look tomorrow see if i can pull him out

2167
06:02:12,060 --> 06:02:20,330
of this and get to b rank before the stream comes to a close here six hours into this

2168
06:02:20,330 --> 06:02:32,909
hopefully i can get him i probably i'm gonna do speed so many managements good luck feeding

2169
06:02:32,909 --> 06:02:37,150
all of them yeah i wish i could hire somebody to come feed them and do you know i wish i

2170
06:02:37,150 --> 06:02:44,400
could have somebody feed them no i don't give him beef he's not hungry he's hungry enough for

2171
06:02:44,400 --> 06:02:57,689
like a mango i feel like i'm gonna accidentally neglect at least two or three of the monsters

2172
06:02:57,689 --> 06:03:00,250
that are here i'm already having trouble dealing with these two or three

2173
06:03:06,639 --> 06:03:17,799
here have a squid disc time before i call it yeah i'll uh i'll after i do this next

2174
06:03:17,799 --> 06:03:20,279
tournament we'll see if we can get something else because that means i would have unlocked

2175
06:03:20,279 --> 06:03:37,759
another set of monsters right getting to b rank all right let's go well i have to you have to get

2176
06:03:37,759 --> 06:04:02,669
to b rank that's another thing tub he's um he'll be fine nice okay decent defense now he's doing

2177
06:04:02,750 --> 06:04:13,180
okay let's praise him and then go win imagine having to make five individual training schedules

2178
06:04:13,180 --> 06:04:19,200
and make sure all your monsters participate in tournaments that's a little too much

2179
06:04:22,479 --> 06:04:37,919
thanks for the stream thanks for watching no problem okay weekend oh no no no not yet

2180
06:04:38,000 --> 06:04:49,549
yeah you're fine all right c cup official c cup moving on to nearly the end of the cups here

2181
06:04:50,189 --> 06:05:03,959
i'm almost gonna be in b and there's a the final is this the fight that is your key to success

2182
06:05:04,840 --> 06:05:17,630
reverto versus ropez pretty strong intelligence but not even close to matching my sheer just

2183
06:05:17,630 --> 06:05:28,060
absolute dominating step hope my advice wasn't annoying no not at all these games are really

2184
06:05:28,060 --> 06:05:36,860
strange and they have a lot of weird particular things so that's fine i'm just kidding around

2185
06:05:36,860 --> 06:05:45,479
when i go back and forth about you know saying random things about the game and i'm just messing

2186
06:05:45,479 --> 06:05:53,919
around i don't think i said anything that but hopefully you don't feel that way here we go

2187
06:05:53,919 --> 06:06:09,790
you know how it's gonna end good start you want to back it up fine air shot i'll take it

2188
06:06:17,720 --> 06:06:28,319
i can't wait for him to win again dodongo versus sherry bundy versus alaman

2189
06:06:28,319 --> 06:06:38,939
dodongo versus ropez ropez looks like you're not gonna win this all right sherry

2190
06:06:40,060 --> 06:06:53,950
you got sherry is pretty scary my intelligence is so low and smoke bomb crescent lightning meteor

2191
06:06:54,830 --> 06:06:57,720
i cannot get hit by one of those up i'll die in one hit

2192
06:07:16,110 --> 06:07:30,189
again quick thank god you just gotta go in you gotta do the front flip move into the slash

2193
06:07:30,830 --> 06:07:52,040
okay reverto versus alaman not that scary but is not gonna miss and dodge a lot of shit

2194
06:07:54,479 --> 06:08:05,900
i'm not gonna go in uh with the typical guaranteed victory button i need something

2195
06:08:05,900 --> 06:08:15,099
that's gonna hit that's 55 70 here we go that's my way no see i guess that one right

2196
06:08:15,900 --> 06:08:48,040
didn't get that one it's a lot of damage it's a lot of overkill but i did it all right bundy

2197
06:08:48,040 --> 06:08:52,939
and dodongo are the ones to worry about these are the ones that are winning no sherry wins

2198
06:08:53,659 --> 06:08:59,639
so dodongo and alaman let's see dodongo is one of those huge rock monsters

2199
06:09:00,830 --> 06:09:14,909
that might be bad for me because all i have a power moves that are really any good decent but

2200
06:09:15,630 --> 06:09:29,240
high health how does counter work uh you can either press x square or circle to do a move

2201
06:09:30,040 --> 06:09:36,279
x is standard square is power and circle is i believe a better chance to hit like lighter

2202
06:09:37,000 --> 06:09:41,959
so when they do a move i have to just guess which one they're doing there's no indicator of which

2203
06:09:41,959 --> 06:09:49,869
it is i have to just do a one out of three chance to get it and if i miss it then i get hit but if

2204
06:09:49,869 --> 06:09:57,450
i counter it i actually the move doesn't work and i hit them that's not good bad start

2205
06:10:00,119 --> 06:10:18,319
holy shit that was okay i pressed square on that that was a power move so dodongo is the only thing

2206
06:10:18,319 --> 06:10:22,560
if dodongo loses here to bundy then i automatically will win the tournament

2207
06:10:25,290 --> 06:10:45,770
that ain't gonna happen though god damn it well let's see 336 power 355 health 272 defense

2208
06:10:47,500 --> 06:10:56,009
oh boy this is gonna be bad low intelligence but so do i i don't my intelligence moves aren't good

2209
06:10:56,009 --> 06:11:06,479
enough to do my speed is awful too this guy's just a better version of me i have to work i'm

2210
06:11:06,479 --> 06:11:12,270
gonna try to counter why you punks you've come out of your hole have you i've been waiting for you

2211
06:11:12,750 --> 06:11:19,099
i couldn't beat you at school but with my new dodongo i'm unbeatable besides i want to impress

2212
06:11:19,099 --> 06:11:27,020
phillias so i mean no forget what i just said i won't pull any punches this time it really is

2213
06:11:27,020 --> 06:11:33,599
just me but stronger i have a little bit more power but he's way more health i have to rely on

2214
06:11:33,599 --> 06:11:56,720
getting a good counter let's try it start like maybe i could just bully him knock it knock it

2215
06:12:01,000 --> 06:12:12,639
oh boy i have to hit him hit him with something come on again hailberry do it oh again do it

2216
06:12:16,669 --> 06:12:19,709
yes oh my god

2217
06:12:19,709 --> 06:12:47,310
see i'm telling you it's gonna be the big guys that do one single move that lands b rank 4000

2218
06:12:47,310 --> 06:13:06,169
gold and a cake you are almost as famous as you can ever possibly be he's an anime protagonist

2219
06:13:06,169 --> 06:13:15,240
it's not fair he never loses congratulations on your victory nice fighting now do you have a

2220
06:13:15,240 --> 06:13:23,279
moment to speak with me sure what is it your victory proves that you too are top class breeders

2221
06:13:23,919 --> 06:13:27,040
and your search in the jungle has proved that you are excellent investigators

2222
06:13:28,080 --> 06:13:36,250
and so i have a very important favor that i'd like to ask of you sounds awfully important yes

2223
06:13:36,250 --> 06:13:43,290
well we at femba sent an investigation team out to the jungle but they haven't returned

2224
06:13:44,759 --> 06:13:49,799
are they lost we don't know with some breeders who have gone exploring have not come back as well

2225
06:13:50,520 --> 06:13:54,430
and so i wish to rely on you with your skills find out what's going on in there

2226
06:13:55,310 --> 06:14:06,880
understood excellent you're a great help i'm just not going in there you deserve a rest

2227
06:14:08,479 --> 06:14:14,029
let's see here b rank now it's just to get real

2228
06:14:16,860 --> 06:14:24,189
five thousand dollars melons salmon all right let's see let's try it this is the real deal

2229
06:14:24,189 --> 06:14:30,680
this is the one thing this is a real game no mistakes allowed up here so Roberto's gonna try

2230
06:14:30,680 --> 06:14:32,840
it let's save the game

2231
06:14:50,250 --> 06:14:58,299
so that last encounter was a little bit of a wake-up call that i need much more power

2232
06:14:58,939 --> 06:15:06,490
and more defense because if i'm gonna trade blows then i better have at least two to 220

2233
06:15:06,490 --> 06:15:25,240
something plus 250 defense because at this point he's got another probably year plus of life

2234
06:15:27,630 --> 06:15:33,630
and i think it's time that we get to like 450 power and actually just try to one hit kill our

2235
06:15:33,630 --> 06:15:43,000
way to the top because spreading out here to intelligence and speed and i think we just have

2236
06:15:43,000 --> 06:16:02,639
to do like 400 power and just do the one hit kill move i'm gonna get to 400 power

2237
06:16:06,619 --> 06:16:07,740
and see where i'm at after that

2238
06:16:07,740 --> 06:16:11,720
that sandbag

2239
06:16:13,549 --> 06:16:17,470
no no no rest right you just you just want a tournament sandbag

2240
06:16:22,000 --> 06:16:27,680
uh let's see sandbag again put a rest in there

2241
06:16:29,680 --> 06:16:32,560
target that's fine uh you can do

2242
06:16:32,560 --> 06:16:50,990
you can do the speed nice can i get the new equipment yet uh i think i think that guy has

2243
06:16:50,990 --> 06:16:55,069
to show up he shows up like once every uh once every few months right once a month

2244
06:17:01,119 --> 06:17:09,000
you need to eat you need to eat too do you know you're fine did i save yeah i saved i got a

2245
06:17:09,000 --> 06:17:31,240
save point uh here's a banana okay i just want to see just how dangerous everybody is here

2246
06:17:32,200 --> 06:17:48,959
i can join no this is group battle oh you gotta be kidding me tag battle

2247
06:17:51,599 --> 06:18:05,229
i have to get somebody else leveled up and ranked up i can't just do it with can i enter this with

2248
06:18:05,229 --> 06:18:17,759
one person i really wish i didn't have to because i'll tell you here's a complaint about monster

2249
06:18:17,840 --> 06:18:24,959
ranch before at this point do do i really need to beat three of these to do an official tournament

2250
06:18:24,959 --> 06:18:30,159
like one of these you know i mean i shouldn't be able to go to one of these like that i should

2251
06:18:30,159 --> 06:18:36,000
be able to i feel like that's added shit for no reason because i'm just gonna go through here

2252
06:18:36,000 --> 06:18:42,090
because my stats are so high i'm just gonna wipe the floor with everybody here with the dragon

2253
06:18:42,409 --> 06:18:51,529
okay if you fuse roberto the fusion will keep its rank that's actually really good to know

2254
06:18:55,099 --> 06:18:58,700
well it's not that i want to cheat with the wolf i just i really don't want to do three

2255
06:18:59,580 --> 06:19:03,229
cloth league tournaments to do the actual tournament

2256
06:19:06,779 --> 06:19:23,200
all right what do we got all right let's get some training done 12 more power slowly climbing away

2257
06:19:23,200 --> 06:19:35,419
over 400 let's give you some more meat and i got some squid here what about the cake

2258
06:19:36,220 --> 06:19:41,630
from the finest bakery it tastes as good as it looks no you get that's a that's a really special

2259
06:19:41,630 --> 06:20:04,380
thing okay have a squid good where's the other guy all right always hungry

2260
06:20:06,459 --> 06:20:13,720
fusing a b tier with an e tier is probably not going to be as good as if you fuse it with

2261
06:20:13,720 --> 06:20:31,240
something else so this is kind of how the game works i guess is so you get this guy

2262
06:20:31,959 --> 06:20:38,279
up to like b rank he's gonna die right so in another year he's dead before he dies

2263
06:20:39,000 --> 06:20:48,240
you freeze him and then you level up somebody else and get them to like cb rank fuse them together

2264
06:20:50,279 --> 06:20:54,599
and then start that person over with insane stats and then they can just grind up to

2265
06:20:54,599 --> 06:21:00,619
s rank that's how it works right for the most part but then this game they have to be friends

2266
06:21:01,500 --> 06:21:10,430
so how does that even work didn't didn't somebody say that they have to be friends with each other

2267
06:21:11,069 --> 06:21:25,599
so can i freeze him and just keep him here let me take a look monster like bonding right

2268
06:21:27,500 --> 06:21:34,459
i mean reverto is really bonded with me but how do i make him friends with somebody else

2269
06:21:34,459 --> 06:21:36,060
they have to like work together or something

2270
06:21:42,189 --> 06:21:59,180
data school land fame raised after i how have i raised seven flowers competitions one affinity

2271
06:22:01,709 --> 06:22:14,729
so good friend friend they're friends great friend i gotta get the dragon up

2272
06:22:18,110 --> 06:22:21,869
the dragon i don't the dragon just has to be leveled up and

2273
06:22:21,950 --> 06:22:33,840
fused together in the time that he still has left yeah after you fuse them they become

2274
06:22:33,840 --> 06:22:46,110
inseparable that's true let's keep moving having five monsters on a farm should be priority number

2275
06:22:46,110 --> 06:22:51,080
one i guess that because then they can all be friends i guess

2276
06:22:53,639 --> 06:22:59,880
yeah all right let's i got up to b rank i think that i'm gonna call it here well not yet i'm

2277
06:22:59,880 --> 06:23:07,310
gonna make two more monsters get them on the farm save it and then we'll call it there so this

2278
06:23:07,310 --> 06:23:11,720
should take us another like probably 30 minutes or so let's get some new monsters let's see how

2279
06:23:11,720 --> 06:23:24,159
it's gonna look does it matter what town i go to well or what shrine i go to i just don't know

2280
06:23:24,159 --> 06:23:29,319
that there is no shrine there is there all right i do have some more of these discs up here so

2281
06:23:29,959 --> 06:23:46,250
which ones did i not use create from a saucer all right let's put in i put it was a jackass

2282
06:23:46,250 --> 06:24:08,830
was the last one who's next we got i put in stuntman this is stuntman ignition i still have

2283
06:24:08,830 --> 06:24:16,799
to play this one for the playstation 3 uh simpsons hit and run i do have it i can put it in but we'll

2284
06:24:16,799 --> 06:24:32,569
do this first put in the matrix you get a unique monster i don't have a physical dvd of the matrix

2285
06:24:32,569 --> 06:25:06,009
here this is stuntman ignition okay please insert the monster rancher disc something unique we have

2286
06:25:06,009 --> 06:25:16,090
we did unlock two or three new breeds so let's see what we get he doesn't have the matrix no

2287
06:25:16,650 --> 06:25:37,959
i don't ape escape i don't have that either i faked it what do you mean fake it it's a pumpkin

2288
06:25:37,959 --> 06:25:54,860
flower it's just a jack-o-lantern so many plants i don't want this no throw it away

2289
06:25:55,900 --> 06:26:08,509
we're gonna try i'll put in simpsons hit and run let me get it first it's over here somewhere

2290
06:26:15,369 --> 06:26:27,819
whoa whoa i almost just ripped up the cord all right what the hell even is simpsons hit and run

2291
06:26:27,819 --> 06:26:42,159
good luck finding that in here i have to like reorganize this whole thing oh good luck this

2292
06:26:42,159 --> 06:26:48,439
whole this whole closet needs to be completely reorganized all right i got lifeline the stupid

2293
06:26:48,439 --> 06:26:57,069
voice activation game there's so many discs in here there's so many trades that this total

2294
06:26:57,069 --> 06:27:15,630
distortion i'll try that we'll put in lifeline i gotta clean that closet out show it i'll show

2295
06:27:15,709 --> 06:27:25,159
it after this just make sure you know i'm not cheating there's a buzz sound did i fuck it up

2296
06:27:32,060 --> 06:28:01,150
i did rip it out hold on how did this even happen what on earth did i do um did i fix it

2297
06:28:01,869 --> 06:28:19,470
did i make it worse still crusty okay well this is uh from lifeline let's see what we get

2298
06:28:27,389 --> 06:28:30,430
i need two more things to just stand there and become friends with each other

06:34:02,240 --> 06:34:18,159
ad i think that may be coming from somewhere else yeah pre-rolls like when you open up the stream

2317
06:34:18,159 --> 06:34:25,200
you'll get an ad but during the stream you should never see an ad i don't run them i don't think

and twitch channel i swear to god

2342
06:40:44,040 --> 06:40:52,189

06:40:57,599 --> 06:41:04,409
every win with ad rock run a three minute ad i mean we actually do joke around about this but

2344
06:41:05,209 --> 06:41:09,369
there are there's okay let's just put it this way there's probably a bunch of people here

2345
06:41:09,450 --> 06:41:14,939
that are just hanging out and watching you just maybe just sitting there just chilling oh this

2346
06:41:14,939 --> 06:41:18,220
is a monster at your four stream i'll just turn this one on you know what i mean this is fun that

2347
06:41:18,220 --> 06:41:24,490
sounds fun you're not chatting you're just kind of hanging out yeah if you get three straight minutes

2348
06:41:24,490 --> 06:41:30,409
of ads you're going to leave you're gonna go okay this is uh he's doing like a joke thing

2349
06:41:30,970 --> 06:41:34,490
and like yeah hey everyone's in on it this is like kind of funny but like fuck three minutes of ads

2350
06:41:34,490 --> 06:41:46,169
like i'm gonna leave nobody wants that nobody wants to see that we need a timer until the next

2351
06:41:54,159 --> 06:41:59,229
all right well i did say that that was going to be it we've been going just about seven hours i'm

2352
06:41:59,229 --> 06:42:09,180
going to call it here it would be funny at first and then after the third or fourth time would be

2353
06:42:09,180 --> 06:42:19,150
like i'm sick of hearing the same loud totino's pizza roll ad over and over again oh i do want

2354
06:42:19,150 --> 06:42:38,189
to see their stats that was just an ad no it wasn't that was me telling you that not to watch

2355
06:42:38,189 --> 06:42:47,880
look at how many people are here all right let's see what are the base stats on blossom not bad

2356
06:42:48,360 --> 06:42:59,900
almost 150 speed 140 intelligence that rock is 147 power pretty terrible actually besides the power

2357
06:43:00,939 --> 06:43:12,759
let me get the moves scissors and whirlwind lots of guts damage what about blossom

2358
06:43:12,919 --> 06:43:33,240
so scratch and hawaiian and a for guts damage hawaiian okay what about traits sweet voice

2359
06:43:34,040 --> 06:43:44,189
increase power boobs that use the voice add rock sounds like malware it probably is but that's

2360
06:43:44,189 --> 06:43:50,939
gonna be it guys here's the plan i'm gonna tell you the plan there's a possibility here so we got

2361
06:43:50,939 --> 06:43:53,500
a lot of random things that are going to be happening over the next few days

2362
06:43:54,779 --> 06:44:04,700
monster rancher 4 a yay or an a from monster rancher 4 continuing this i still fun we got a

2363
06:44:04,700 --> 06:44:13,400
yay thing probably i think people are having fun people enjoying this i am we have our dream team

2364
06:44:13,400 --> 06:44:23,599
here let me save it i think it's fun yeah i'm having a great time i feel like i'm gonna get

2365
06:44:23,599 --> 06:44:35,200
really irritated at the countering system but you know it's fine you're asking the people that stuck

2366
06:44:35,200 --> 06:44:45,689
around for seven hours yeah the best people to ask but even though this is that yeah fuck

2367
06:44:45,689 --> 06:44:53,360
it i'll do it that sounds fun we'll do it again but in between the next stream is probably not

2368
06:44:53,360 --> 06:44:59,560
going to be monster range for there's the scratch ticket stream for sekiro that's going to take me

2369
06:44:59,560 --> 06:45:03,240
at least like an hour or two to scratch those i already got confirmation with twitch that that

2370
06:45:03,240 --> 06:45:09,639
should be fine you don't know what that what's happening there for every time i died in sekiro

2371
06:45:09,639 --> 06:45:17,159
i'm buying that amount monetarily in scratch tickets so whether it's a bunch of ten dollar

2372
06:45:17,159 --> 06:45:22,360
five dollar equaling two hundred and twenty one dollars i'm going to scratch all those tickets

2373
06:45:22,360 --> 06:45:31,400
on stream and whatever happens through those tickets is going to go right to charity if i

2374
06:45:31,400 --> 06:45:37,080
don't win anything if it's zero i'm going to donate two hundred and twenty one dollars

2375
06:45:37,639 --> 06:45:51,900
to that charity anyways so winner lose that was something that why wait why 221 i died 221 times

2376
06:45:51,900 --> 06:45:57,439
in sekiro and said that i was going to get a scratch ticket for every death even if it's a

2377
06:45:57,439 --> 06:46:03,209
million dollars yes if i hit a million dollars on one of these scratch tickets the charity is

2378
06:46:03,209 --> 06:46:16,520
getting a million dollars that's just going to happen why did you die that much all right whatever

2379
06:46:18,110 --> 06:46:23,069
it's gonna be funny when you only donate six dollars because you only win six dollars but that

2380
06:46:23,069 --> 06:46:31,529
i just told you i'm going regardless of anything i'm going to donate at least 221 dollars like if i

2381
06:46:38,860 --> 06:46:43,020
scratch up like hundreds of dollars worth of tickets you win like eight bucks all right

2382
06:46:43,020 --> 06:46:58,750
eight dollars is going here no it would be so it would be dumb but that's the plan that's

2383
06:46:58,750 --> 06:47:16,139
including revives now they they kept track there was a the actual deaths i think please

2384
06:47:16,139 --> 06:47:18,779
do a three minute ad i would love to see some products to buy

2385
06:47:25,720 --> 06:47:32,860
uh so the charity that i'm going to choose i have not decided yet uh i have narrowed it down to a

2386
06:47:32,860 --> 06:47:49,790
few what about taxes okay so that's whatever i can so okay let's say i on stream hit like

2387
06:47:50,750 --> 06:47:55,310
this is not this is probably not going to happen but like if i win like 50 grand on a scratch

2388
06:47:55,310 --> 06:48:01,500
ticket on stream i i don't know how taxes work with that i don't know this is a question for

2389
06:48:01,500 --> 06:48:12,520
my cpa because if i win 50 grand on a scratch ticket a bunch of that's taxed so then i would

2390
06:48:12,520 --> 06:48:18,409
have to pay taxes on that but i would give it to be given it to charity but charity is deductible

2391
06:48:18,409 --> 06:48:30,000
from taxes but was that with that count as income i would be getting 50 grand of income and writing

2392
06:48:30,000 --> 06:48:42,000
off 50 grand of income how does that work i'm gonna okay i'm gonna i gotta call my cpa about

2393
06:48:42,000 --> 06:48:50,000
this he's gonna think i'm fucking insane hey so i have a question for you if i buy

2394
06:48:51,040 --> 06:48:56,880
200 dollars worth of scratch tickets and i win 50 grand and give 50 grand of charity what happens

2395
06:48:56,880 --> 06:49:12,270
to my income he's probably gonna go what the fuck are you talking about he's probably gonna

2396
06:49:12,270 --> 06:49:31,389
hang up on me he's watching now no do that voice on the phone hey i got a question for you

2397
06:49:35,310 --> 06:49:48,040
all right that's it let's get out of here thanks for hanging out everybody i'll see you guys in a

2398
06:49:48,040 --> 06:49:56,479
couple days i'll see you on thursday so this i depending on what happens italics and i were

2399
06:49:56,479 --> 06:50:01,439
going to play risk of rain two together we're thinking about doing that monster rancher four

2400
06:50:01,439 --> 06:50:07,759
has to continue sakiro scratch off to charity stream has to do has to be there and then something

2401
06:50:07,759 --> 06:50:15,560
else and i mean well look i'll just say i'll just tell you what it is i'm gonna play the uh the germa

2402
06:50:15,560 --> 06:50:25,959
game on stream it's coming out real soon prepare for that it's gonna be it's gonna be real soon

2403
06:50:33,180 --> 06:50:42,479
on pc yep on pc does that include ads no risk of rain two is very very good

2404
06:50:43,200 --> 06:50:48,479
yeah so but we'll jumble it around but that's what you can expect over this next uh week or so

2405
06:50:49,040 --> 06:50:56,700
general roll the ads oh okay i'll do the three minutes of ads at the end of the stream before i

2406
06:50:56,700 --> 06:51:02,799
leave because i want everyone that does not want to see three minutes of ads to have an opportunity

2407
06:51:02,799 --> 06:51:16,270
to just leave so we're gonna do the bits let's go back uh about seven plus hours ago just about

2408
06:51:16,270 --> 06:51:28,479
seven hours ago to the beginning and it was lazy luke thanks for the 250 lazy luke they say germa

2409
06:51:28,479 --> 06:51:37,319
heart it's all thank you for the 250 thank you also to uh tingy for the 250 if you do have the

2410
06:51:37,319 --> 06:51:40,680
scratch ticket stream sometime this week and please be on the weekend i don't want to miss

2411
06:51:40,680 --> 06:51:48,540
it due to work it'll probably end up being let me just try to think this through here

2412
06:51:49,419 --> 06:51:56,060
so nothing tomorrow on wednesday and then thursday friday saturday all right i would probably do

2413
06:51:57,919 --> 06:52:06,330
saturday might be a really weird stream because saturday might turn out to be

2414
06:52:07,290 --> 06:52:17,369
the sakiro scratch off and the germa slot game stream because i feel like that would be a whole

2415
06:52:17,369 --> 06:52:26,880
stream worth of stuff to do because i feel like the scratching the tickets is going to take probably

2416
06:52:26,880 --> 06:52:31,840
like an hour plus and then that a game is going to take a couple hours probably or an hour plus

2417
06:52:32,959 --> 06:52:45,869
i feel like that makes sense to have those be on the same day you know one can kind of prelude to

2418
06:52:45,950 --> 06:52:54,750
the other sounds like a plan and then that makes thursday and friday monster rancher 4 will come

2419
06:52:54,750 --> 06:53:00,270
back if not thursday then friday and if me and italics play risk of rain then we'll continue

2420
06:53:00,270 --> 06:53:07,680
monster rancher 4 on friday so you can probably assume risk of rain 2 monster rancher 4 and the

2421
06:53:07,680 --> 06:53:24,490
weird like irl gambling stream somehow sounds good so expect that on saturday you did spend

2422
06:53:24,490 --> 06:53:32,479
six hours trying to build a bird house that's true was that six hours is gambling against the

2423
06:53:32,479 --> 06:53:39,709
tos now i actually i talked to two twitch staff about this and as long as gambling is legal in

2424
06:53:39,709 --> 06:53:45,959
your area in your state it's fine i mean especially considering that whatever money i would win

2425
06:53:46,680 --> 06:53:58,090
would just be going to charity there's i mean guys i live in las vegas is gambling legal in nevada

2426
06:53:58,090 --> 06:54:05,209
let me check let me ask one of the 300 casinos that are within a 15 mile radius of where i'm

2427
06:54:05,209 --> 06:54:17,580
standing right now do i still have the bird house uh i don't think i do i may have i may have thrown

2428
06:54:17,580 --> 06:54:21,900
that away i think i had like no actually you know i just i think it is still down downstairs

2429
06:54:23,130 --> 06:54:33,520
i think it's still there but thank you tingy probably see you on saturday for that thank you

2430
06:54:33,599 --> 06:54:43,400

2439
06:55:43,529 --> 06:55:47,770
it a little later when things simmer down in the theaters watching either way has its benefits but

2440
06:55:47,770 --> 06:55:53,610
i just want to know how you like to watch your movies i like to watch my movies in an empty

2441
06:55:53,610 --> 06:56:04,240
theater because anytime i go to a movie that's packed it's always been one of those scenarios

2442
06:56:04,240 --> 06:56:16,380
where every possible moment for somebody to scream yeah oh whoa what the whoa like spider-man shows

2443
06:56:16,380 --> 06:56:21,639
up for the first time and it's like the spider spider-man whoo it's like we all know he's in the

2444
06:56:21,639 --> 06:56:27,080
fucking movie i know spider-man's in the movie you know spider-man's in the movie why do we all

2445
06:56:27,080 --> 06:56:32,360
have to cheer when spider-man shows up in the movie you saw the trailer spider-man's in this movie

2446
06:56:32,919 --> 06:56:41,020
iron man does like a big blast out of his hands everybody screams it's like he didn't do anything

2447
06:56:41,659 --> 06:56:58,639
they should really only fill half the theater for the real experience well for me a little bit

2448
06:56:58,639 --> 06:57:06,400
because uh because of they want to make sure that there's not enough not a lot of noise in the

2449
06:57:06,400 --> 06:57:13,919
theater you know what i mean i see what exactly what you mean by that because you just because

2450
06:57:13,919 --> 06:57:18,479
it could get loud in the theater and you should be like easier to hear and stuff that's why i know

2451
06:57:18,479 --> 06:57:30,619
exactly what you're talking about thank you people clap during the theater what are you clapping for

2452
06:57:30,619 --> 06:57:38,889
they can't hear you danos is coming in for the big punch oh iron man spins around and like knocks

2453
06:57:38,889 --> 06:57:58,909
him out nice nice job tony tony i love you one time that happened i stood up and i pointed up

2454
06:57:58,909 --> 06:58:07,319
at the like five people stood up clapping and like screaming i saw somebody was on their phone i

2455
06:58:07,319 --> 06:58:10,919
heard like a fucking phone ring and turn your phone off too by the way don't bring your phone

2456
06:58:10,919 --> 06:58:15,799
into the movie i don't understand everybody knows not to be on your phone in the movie theater and

2457
06:58:15,799 --> 06:58:20,200
everybody gets angry at other people for being on the phone yet you will open up your phone and look

2458
06:58:20,200 --> 06:58:24,919
at it and then somebody five seats down is mad that you're opening up your phone and that person

2459
06:58:24,919 --> 06:58:30,750
also gets pissed off when other people use their phone and then they open up their phone it's a

2460
06:58:30,750 --> 06:58:34,669
cycle it's a vicious circle of everyone using their phones and being mad at other people for

2461
06:58:34,669 --> 06:58:41,020
using their phones just don't do it anyways this is all happening loud noises fucking

intermission today thanks for the years of great streams you mentioned before you used to play

2654
07:29:35,659 --> 07:29:41,310
diablo 2 for hours would you ever consider playing it or something like it on stream

2655
07:29:41,310 --> 07:29:47,599
i don't i don't think so the last game that i played that was a isometric rpg like that was

2656
07:29:47,599 --> 07:29:54,459
grim don and i played it through the third act it was before it was all done and i never went

2657
07:29:54,459 --> 07:29:58,700
back and finished it but i don't think i would stream a game like that a game like that is

2658
07:29:58,700 --> 07:30:10,619
probably something i would do just for to kind of chill out and just open my mouth and play a game

2659
07:30:10,619 --> 07:30:19,580
maybe for a chill stream it would make sense but not something that's in the pipeline or anything

2660
07:30:19,580 --> 07:30:30,639
