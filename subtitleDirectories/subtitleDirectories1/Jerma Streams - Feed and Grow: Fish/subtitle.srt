1
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,330
How's everybody doing? How are you? How have you been? You've been good?

2
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:12,410
Doing all right? How are things? Things going all right?

3
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,280
I'm late? Well, I'm not really. I'm not really. I'm early.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:37,280
Started to 40 minutes early. Is that you? Is it you from Fortnite?

5
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:48,079
Yeah, that's me from Fortnite. I've played it before. You sound tall today.

6
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:55,469
Do I? Interesting. I sound tall today. Do I sound different today?

7
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:59,899
Would you say that I sound a little a little different today?

8
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,060
In regards to the other few days, few months, maybe.

9
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:13,599
Yeah. Hmm. No, there is no I don't notice anything.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,920
No, I don't. I don't know. Did you change something? Interesting.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,609
I went back to the other mic and I had someone here

12
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,489
that went through all the audio settings and tried to solve the mystery

13
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,209
of why my microphone sounds so bad. This is the this is the other microphone.

14
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,659
And let's do a scream test.

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,760
We, we, we, we, we fixed it, by the way.

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:52,579
Thanks a lot. Audio community, Jake.

17
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,859
You smoked a ball and watched.

18
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,579
Yeah. Can you give me a fix this?

19
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,760
Yeah, I just smoke.

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,340
You want money? No, no, you're not getting any of that.

21
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,159
Be honest with me. Are we good?

22
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,400
Are we actually good for real?

23
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,000
Like, do I sound fine? Do I need to be louder? Do I?

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,560
Are we good? Finally? Am I finally good?

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,840
Can I get louder and can we test it? Do I sound fine?

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,280
Am I good to go now?

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,800
Do I am I a live streamer after 12 fucking years?

28
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:36,180
Do I sound OK?

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,110
Now we just need to fix the webcam, which is I'm never changing it, by the way.

30
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:44,860
I did move it about two inches.

31
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,219
Anyways, welcome.

32
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:48,099
I will be the first to welcome you. Welcome to

33
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,539
what we're coining here on this community as Omega Gaming Weekend.

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,080
That's right. That's right.

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,219
Just regular streams.

36
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,539
I just happen to be doing them in a row.

37
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:03,900
Normal stream is streaming normally.

38
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,310
Just happened to be doing it a few times in a row.

39
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,060
That's literally it.

40
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,460
Oh, I get it. This is Omega Gaming Weekend.

41
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,860
I'm your host.

42
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,300
We're going to be starting with fish, feed and grow.

43
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,889
By the way, I've got actually 25 games to play this weekend.

44
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,180
I'm going to read them to you.

45
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,139
And look, I'm not writing them down because if you don't remember, that's your fault.

46
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:36,819
I'm going to go through them quick

47
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,659
because I don't want I want people to go like, wait, what the wait?

48
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:40,340
What did you say? Hey, somebody in the discord.

49
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,419
What was the last one? No. Good luck.

50
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,060
Over the next three days, we're going to play for at least 30 to 40 minutes each

51
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,800
or maybe like 20, maybe 10 minutes.

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,189
It might suck.

53
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,710
Some of these we might not play at all.

54
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,830
Let me make that clear.

55
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,069
I just put them on here to make people like get excited, but they're available.

56
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,129
Slice and dice from Ichiyo.

57
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,689
20 minutes till dawn.

58
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:06,650
Grounded plants versus zombies, the original one.

59
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,129
Sorcery part three, Splatoon three, Breath of the Wild, the Zoombinis,

60
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,129
Ultrakill, Disney Infinity 3.0, feed and grow fish,

61
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,810
multiverses, hamster playground, Turmoil, Betrayal at Club Low,

62
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,649
Dead Rising 3, Deadly Night, Bounty of One, Cult of the Lamb,

63
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:29,930
Puparazzi, Peglin, Pathologic 2, Talk to Strangers and Subnautica below zero.

64
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,889
I hope everybody gets fucking freaks out over those.

65
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:41,439
We're probably going to play four of them.

66
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,180
We're going to get through five of these.

67
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,939
It's a boring, what do you mean a boring list?

68
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:49,259
Somebody said, you said boring list?

69
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,850
Bro, boring list.

70
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,819
Breath of the Wild, Deadly Night, Slice and Dice, Splatoon.

71
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,420
I told you I would never play Splatoon.

72
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,459
Why? How come? Why are you not free?

73
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,540
What game would be on this list that you would be happy with?

74
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,379
There's every genre.

75
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,300
Some of these are some of the highest rated games

76
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,540
that come out in the last like five, ten years.

77
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,259
What would be on here? Roblox?

78
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,670
Why would I play Roblox? Why would I play Fortnite?

79
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,490
I'm not going to play Fortnite.

80
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,810
How come Ghostbusters 2011 is not on there?

81
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,810
It's not on here.

82
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:39,040
This is Omega Gaming Weekend and I picked the game.

83
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,980
Boring list.

84
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Plants, the original Plants versus Zombies is like, holy shit.

85
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,579
I would have freaked out if I heard that and I was in the chat.

86
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,980
And maybe at some point during this weekend,

87
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,019
you might be able to face me in multiverses.

88
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,470
I'll see you in the multiverses.

89
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,389
There's no sponsor this weekend. Let me just be clear.

90
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:08,959
I'm just like walking around.

91
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,490
There's no sponsor or anything. I'm just I'm being a weirdo.

92
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,850
All right. So here's what we're going to do.

93
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,529
There was a poll in pre-stream. If you weren't here, then well, sorry.

94
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,060
We're going to start with feed and grow fish.

95
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,660
I don't think the multiplayer works. I tried it a few times.

96
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,660
I it doesn't work.

97
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,120
So we're just going to do single player.

98
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,199
And I'm here like 40 minutes early, so relax.

99
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,939
You know, honestly, I really shouldn't even said the list out loud

100
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,860
because I would I could have said, hey, I got 25 games.

101
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,990
And some of you game Andes that I'm mad that, you know,

102
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,389
Mario Galaxy 2 isn't on here.

103
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,189
You might have thought it was on here.

104
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,350
I could have just pretended like, oh, no, there's other stuff on here.

105
00:06:51,350 --> 00:07:03,689
You don't you never know what's on here.

106
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,730
None of these before. I know I'm just I'm being a weirdo.

107
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,009
All right. So we're going to start. Let's go.

108
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,730
This is Omega Gaming Weekend, and I'm your host.

109
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,970
Terminate. How are you?

110
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,139
New angle. What do you think?

111
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,860
New audio, new angle.

112
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,060
It's a little bit over here. It's not as weird, right?

113
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,470
I was told it by somebody very, very reliable that it was weird,

114
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:34,259
and I couldn't understand.

115
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,139
Somebody told me the camera angle the last time,

116
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,339
the last two times have been fucking weird.

117
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,980
No, there's no way you're saying that.

118
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,459
There's no it's impossible.

119
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:48,680
Like, no, my own girlfriend says this.

120
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,189
I'm like, there's no way there's no fucking way.

121
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,399
I looked fine. Why was it so weird?

122
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,800
It's just a webcam. It's just a face cam.

123
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,879
Who cares? It doesn't care.

124
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:08,329
Does it really matter? It's every everybody is against me

125
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:13,579
from Community Jake to my girlfriend, to my entire community, to my parents.

126
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:15,300
I had my mother look at it.

127
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,449
She was like, you look strange, honey.

128
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,930
I'm just like, no, everyone's against me.

129
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,199
They don't. Nobody gets it.

130
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,660
Nobody gets it but me. You know what I'm saying?

131
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,860
I don't know. That was supposed to be a neck crack.

132
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,539
All right, let's go.

133
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,320
This is game where you have to you have to eat and you have to grow.

134
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,259
And I don't know. People said play it.

135
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:45,149
This is what we're starting with. Let's start in the river.

136
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,610
Do mediums. Wait, this is too quiet.

137
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,899
Can you just hear anything? There we go.

138
00:08:53,899 --> 00:09:00,360
Now I can hear it. All right, let's go.

139
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,940
This is a child game.

140
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,860
All right, I got a hatch.

141
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,740
So this is a game.

142
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,259
It's like what's that game that came out like 20 years ago?

143
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,330
You have to don't get eaten, but you have to eat fish.

144
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,570
Eat five and raise four babies.

145
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:29,269
How do I isn't attacking me? How do I eat?

146
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:39,940
This is my mouth. Am I eating this?

147
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,039
Is that my mouth opening and closing?

148
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:51,100
What's that? Oh, it's candy.

149
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,779
Candy. Oh, that's alive.

150
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,700
Was it alive?

151
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,100
Hey, get out of this mine.

152
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:10,610
OK, wait, there's a little one right here.

153
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:23,379
Do I eat snails? What can I eat?

154
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:29,059
Do I have to eat the candies and that's it?

155
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:31,419
Where's my fish? Oh, there I am.

156
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:39,960
How could you not like it? Look on the left.

157
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,870
Yeah, I need to eat. Does that mean how do I turn?

158
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:56,480
Oh, shit. OK, where where do I eat food?

159
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,720
Can I walk yet? Oh, shit. There he is.

160
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:17,740
He's not coming for me, right? Oh, wait a minute.

161
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,909
Oh, no, I feel bad. That was like horrible.

162
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:31,179
That was like horrible.

163
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:35,450
How do I grow up?

164
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,250
It looks like the hunter became the hunted.

165
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,779
Where are we all going?

166
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:51,070
I don't know where I'm supposed to be going.

167
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,820
I just wait and be a scavenger.

168
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,700
Where's my health going down?

169
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,740
My health is going. What do I do?

170
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,659
Do I eat rocks?

171
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:17,370
Wait, there it is. Get it.

172
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:37,620
How do you eat? Am I dead?

173
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,220
Can I just attach to this?

174
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,100
How was the break button?

175
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,059
I'm dead. OK, that's fun.

176
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,769
Now, wait, now I it wasn't enough.

177
00:12:50,769 --> 00:13:09,649
It wasn't even clear what I needed to do.

178
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,100
OK, eat five of those.

179
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:18,029
I'm not big enough to eat five of those.

180
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:28,700
Get out of here. What am I even eating?

181
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,879
Dude, I can't eat anything.

182
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:48,980
What? That's your brother.

183
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,629
I didn't eat him.

184
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:56,740
We're going to stick together, bro.

185
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:08,649
Let's stay together.

186
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:11,990
Survival of the fittest, bro. Sorry.

187
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,779
Where'd he go? Oh, wait.

188
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,460
This is bad. Oh, no.

189
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,629
You're in trouble. OK, bye.

190
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,470
Dude, what the fuck? Nature sucks.

191
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,080
Like, imagine being a little minnow or something.

192
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,559
You've born and you're just dead.

193
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,620
What? That's terrible.

194
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,620
Like, I'm alive.

195
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,100
Gone. You don't even know.

196
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,860
You don't even know that you're alive.

197
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,620
It's crazy.

198
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,539
I think that fish is dead.

199
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:51,710
All right, I need to find little things to eat.

200
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,909
How do you turn?

201
00:14:55,909 --> 00:15:00,330
Am I swimming upstream? Is that the problem?

202
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,330
All right, this group, but we can hang out with this group.

203
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:09,379
I'm dead. OK, great.

204
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:23,129
This guy's a maniac. Are you kidding me?

205
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:23,929
I'm coming for that guy.

206
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:31,259
I have to at least get to the next height, right?

207
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:36,549
OK, what is small enough for me to eat?

208
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:39,590
I have to find food that's been ripped up already.

209
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:47,789
And then we just eat it.

210
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:52,139
OK, I'm going this way.

211
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,769
Don't run into me.

212
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:58,279
Terraria music kind of sounds like that.

213
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,850
But what do I I can't eat?

214
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,970
Wouldn't that be just what should I do?

215
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,169
Is it stuff on the ground?

216
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:07,340
What about this? This is like a grasshopper.

217
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,259
OK, you need the grasshoppers. Good.

218
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:19,169
Thanks. You need the little like grasshopper shrimp.

219
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,379
I can't actually.

220
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:38,769
Are you small enough? No.

221
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:43,889
Left, left, left.

222
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:44,730
No, it's too big.

223
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:50,370
Top left, top left.

224
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,830
Eat five of those. They're too big.

225
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,870
Why can you eat that and I can't?

226
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,779
I don't get it.

227
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,220
Why can you eat that and I can't?

228
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,740
I don't understand. What do you mean wrong button?

229
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:32,339
It's not left click, right click.

230
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:33,180
There we go. All right.

231
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:40,539
I figured I had to play. That was sad.

232
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,160
I don't want to eat the snails.

233
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,789
There are only one XP.

234
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:47,910
This is going to take all day to get higher.

235
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:55,339
Wait, there's worms.

236
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:56,940
Just stay on the ground. I'm not going anywhere.

237
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:08,579
Yeah, just eat these worms.

238
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,220
If I hide in this area, the big ones won't get.

239
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,740
This is a horror game. All right.

240
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,990
Stay on the ground.

241
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:38,150
Get over here, you fucking grasshopper.

242
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:49,259
Don't even think about it.

243
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,450
This is safe in here, I think.

244
00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:00,609
Halfway. You're getting toxic.

245
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,210
I'm just trying to level up once.

246
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:25,900
Hopefully my brothers and sisters made it.

247
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,779
Wait, I just got a huge amount of experience.

248
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:33,660
But what? You can do first person.

249
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:41,190
No, you can't. Look at how dirty that one is.

250
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:51,339
All right. Come on. I'm so close to leveling.

251
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,779
Level up. All right. Am I bigger?

252
00:19:53,779 --> 00:20:01,910
I am a little bigger. OK.

253
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:08,039
What can I what can I fit in my mouth now?

254
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:18,619
I'm going to snipe this. I got it. I got it.

255
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:37,289
I sniped it. What's wrong with me?

256
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:42,000
Why am I dying? Oh, that's not filling anymore.

257
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,220
All right. I need to scavenge, I think.

258
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,420
Maybe I can eat the little little ones.

259
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:56,980
Let's see. I can eat these still.

260
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:03,200
You know, sometimes my brain decides to think a certain way.

261
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,740
And I was just concerned that I was going to drown.

262
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,460
I was like, oh, do I have to go up for air?

263
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,579
Because where's my air meter?

264
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:13,230
And I'm like, wait, that doesn't make any sense.

265
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,589
In my brain for one second, I was not a fish.

266
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:17,470
I was a person down here or I was a different

267
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:31,440
like an animal or something. Wait, danger.

268
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,740
Oh, I'm not supposed to be here.

269
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,630
Nemo did not show up here.

270
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,160
Oh, how do I get back up?

271
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:54,630
How do I climb back up? How do I climb back up?

272
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,230
I went to the next area.

273
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:08,230
OK, wait, I might be able to scavenge.

274
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,630
This is definitely a scavenge scenario.

275
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,039
Look at all these.

276
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:16,960
OK, here we go. And oh, never mind.

277
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,599
Oh, shit, that's one of my friends.

278
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,079
How did you get down here?

279
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:35,910
It's all right. I got you. Try to eat them.

280
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,630
Oh, my God. Hide in the, hide in the murkiness.

281
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,099
I just got baited so bad. That was terrible.

282
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:53,119
This game is scary.

283
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,859
You know where this would be crazy is VR.

284
00:22:55,859 --> 00:22:58,140
Do you imagine having to deal with this in VR?

285
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:02,740
You're not going to eat.

286
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,359
I'm way too small of a fry for you.

287
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,880
But oh, shit, you ate it in one gulp.

288
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,759
OK, I was going to say, break it up for me.

289
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:12,900
I'm going to follow you.

290
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,039
I'm following the big chunky one.

291
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,799
Because nobody's going to fuck with the big chunky one, right?

292
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,950
And the big chunky one will leave some scraps.

293
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,420
Don't be stupid. All right, here we go.

294
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,220
There's no chance anyone's going to fuck with the big chunky guy.

295
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,180
Hold on. Did I get any? Shit, I didn't get any.

296
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,380
Ow. I'm dead.

297
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,500
Oh, my God. I was so close.

298
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,660
All right. I'm good. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

299
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,750
I got it. I got it. I got it.

300
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,640
What fish are you? I actually don't have any idea.

301
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
Shit. Oh, that's so frustrating.

302
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:07,039
I'm too impatient to play this.

303
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,119
I swam directly into one of their mouths.

304
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:27,559
I got some. All right. That's a huge chunk.

305
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:38,250
Deathmatch is quicker.

306
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,730
I'll try this in another couple of times.

307
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,970
You pick the fish that you want to start as, I think, right?

308
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:49,130
How I understand it. This game's kind of fun.

309
00:24:49,130 --> 00:25:00,670
This is really dumb what I'm doing, but whatever.

310
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:12,539
But look at the frenzy over here. I need to eat something.

311
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:22,519
I can't swim down. The current is so strong here.

312
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:41,259
I actually cannot move. Is that a snail?

313
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:51,160
What is this snail doing?

314
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:58,420
Is that a hook? Is it a hook?

315
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:19,799
He's tripping. All right. Come on.

316
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:28,319
How am I not getting full from this?

317
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:35,900
Am I sprinting too much? Get off me. Get off.

318
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,009
Get away from me. Oh, my God. This game's hard.

319
00:26:40,009 --> 00:27:03,230
Fuck. Let's go. What's the strat here?

320
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,460
I'm just going to float on the bottom and just I'm going to coast.

321
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:16,759
I'm not going to dash unless I hear the scary sound yet.

322
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,799
Please, seriously, get out of here.

323
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,500
Go eat something that's way bigger.

324
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,460
You're really going to come after the one single McDonald's French fry

325
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,420
when there are cheeseburgers in the ocean,

326
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,420
when there are steaks in the ocean floating around.

327
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,859
You're going to eat the one single fucking McDonald's French fry.

328
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:38,359
Get out of here. Fuck off.

329
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:52,819
It's true, though. Already leveled up.

330
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:54,940
Like, this looks delicious.

331
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,220
Yeah. You know, you know, the crumbs that are on the counter

332
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,900
after you make a sandwich.

333
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,619
Hmm. Don't eat the sandwich, though, that literally swam away.

334
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:16,900
It ran away. It ran by.

335
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:24,869
I'm not going that way. You look handsome today. Thanks.

336
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,789
Stop YouTube reacting.

337
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:40,579
You're fine. You actually he's right next to me.

338
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:43,289
OK. How do I get out of here?

339
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:49,539
Eat him, eat him, eat him, eat him, eat him, eat him.

340
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:52,380
He's he tastes better.

341
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,619
He was he was he was dipped in beer, batter, oil.

342
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:10,009
Well, I'm what?

343
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,369
Why are we all getting sucked into like wormhole?

344
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:15,359
Oh, no, I'm out of here.

345
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,410
I am out of here.

346
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:25,809
Go back down to the sea floor.

347
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:30,589
I'm not messing around now.

348
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:32,950
Why am I dying? Oh, I'm hungry.

349
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:48,740
Come on. What?

350
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,940
How many of these do I have to eat before I'm fine?

351
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:57,109
Oh, God. Oh, it's so fucking hard.

352
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,059
I got better. I got better. I got better.

353
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:14,470
Look at this. Come on.

354
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,630
Poor little fellow.

355
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:25,960
OK. What am I doing wrong here?

356
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:32,609
Let us eat it. Leave some for me, too.

357
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:36,089
You can't just eat it all. You took two of those.

358
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,089
That's not fair. We should have split it exactly one and a half.

359
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:41,549
One and a half.

360
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:52,789
Hey, if if if mom didn't just get eaten, I would tell her I'm to leave.

361
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,339
Can we take this thing? Oh, no, no, brother.

362
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,630
What do I do? Can I stop this?

363
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,019
Brother, I need to tell you something.

364
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:12,180
If you die, I'm going to eat your body, just letting you know.

365
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,220
That's the way it is, right?

366
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,019
That's the way of nature, unfortunately.

367
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:35,269
OK, save a seat at the oh, I think he's dead.

368
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:37,549
No, he's still alive. He's still alive.

369
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:46,859
He's still alive. This is so sad.

370
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,809
No, not me. He's still alive.

371
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:04,299
I'm I'm going to die if I don't eat something right now.

372
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:08,440
You piece of shit. I swear to God.

373
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,390
If I if I go even five feet above the ground,

374
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,720
I'm going to uninstall steam.

375
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,420
You understand? Like this round, don't leave the floor.

376
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
Just eat everything on the floor.

377
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,460
Why am I flying around looking at stuff?

378
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,059
This is guaranteed death.

379
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:54,789
Look at all these scrumptious things down here.

380
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:57,410
That's not five feet. That's like two feet.

381
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,609
Actually, two feet.

382
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:10,220
We're talking about the scale of the actual game.

383
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,720
There we go. All right. Nice.

384
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,039
Oh, chop that up. Chop them up.

385
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,079
Chop them up. Chop them up.

386
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,000
I'll level up immediately. Can I help?

387
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:26,509
He's hit me with a tail.

388
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:28,589
I got experience for being around that when it died.

389
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:42,349
Give me some. Give me. It's too big.

390
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:53,220
I can't eat it.

391
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:58,279
Oh, OK. Don't be stupid. Don't be greedy.

392
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:07,700
All right. Get out. Get out. Get out. I'm almost level three.

393
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:21,829
I need more. I'm hungry.

394
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:36,659
Eat him in his sleep. Come on.

395
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:54,639
What the fuck? This game is so funny.

396
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,349
God damn it.

397
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,070
Can we just like latch on to this guy and like attack him?

398
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:07,750
No, I can't. Why didn't I couldn't break him up?

399
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,400
I have gums. I have one tooth.

400
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:20,340
Do not leak.

401
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,780
Don't do not even go one or two, five feet above where you are right now

402
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,650
until level two. Just stay on the ground.

403
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:42,489
Don't get up or anything. Eat the grasshoppers.

404
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:54,710
OK. Stay down here for now.

405
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,389
Only go up if I see an opportunity.

406
00:35:56,389 --> 00:36:02,980
No other reason. Opportunity.

407
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,300
All on everything.

408
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,219
I just got a ton of experience.

409
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:09,599
Something big died around here somewhere.

410
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,380
All right. This is huge. This is huge.

411
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,699
I might actually be able to see what the hell level three looks like.

412
00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:30,199
Almost there. I eat that.

413
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:35,260
Oh, get away from me.

414
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,260
All right. Now you want to go. You want to go now?

415
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,840
Yeah, get munched.

416
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:54,539
Expect me to grow up, did you?

417
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:56,110
I'll take you instead.

418
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,309
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

419
00:36:57,309 --> 00:36:58,940
I'm running out of food.

420
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:10,340
Just go back down to the snails and shit.

421
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:23,860
OK, am I right?

422
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:31,010
Whoa, one of are you a friend?

423
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,500
Why you look at he's green.

424
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,320
I need to help him. Stop fighting.

425
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,960
What are you doing? You can't take that on.

426
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,719
Are you out of your mind? I'll help you.

427
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:51,860
We can eat this. We need this. We need this.

428
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,190
You're so fast.

429
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,309
You still with me?

430
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,289
He doesn't look so good. He's green.

431
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:05,909
No, don't mess with that.

432
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,190
All right.

433
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,420
Wait, wait, opportunity.

434
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,460
I don't know what to do.

435
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,739
I'm just floating.

436
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:12,619
I'm just floating right now.

437
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:16,940
I don't know what to do. I'm freaking out.

438
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,460
Oh, no, greenie.

439
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,300
Stay with us.

440
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,429
What the fuck? It's impossible.

441
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:31,590
It's impossible.

442
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,909
That was a new rare species and we'll never know.

443
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,699
Don't go near the big fish.

444
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:50,380
Oh, the current is just taking me.

445
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,179
I can't. I have to.

446
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:53,780
The current is just moving me.

447
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:07,780
Oh, help me.

448
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,170
Somebody, see if you fucking like it.

449
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,349
You like it? Huh?

450
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:22,900
David and Goliath time.

451
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,599
Did that hurt?

452
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,849
They were just reacting to that.

453
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:34,500
Did you see that?

454
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:42,579
He was like, and then just walked away.

455
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,260
I have to get to level four or so.

456
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,940
There's other areas too.

457
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,500
Like, what are you even doing in our spawn?

458
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,940
Spawn camping piece of shit.

459
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,789
Like, get him out of here.

460
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,480
You know what I'm saying?

461
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,869
Like, why can he spawn camp? That's not fair.

462
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:10,980
All right. Do the same thing I did last time.

463
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,909
I'll get to level two here.

464
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:16,329
This guy's annoying.

465
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:19,610
Yeah. Can you please get out?

466
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,530
Can you please like get the fuck out of Angoro Crater

467
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,369
and go to the Northrend where you belong,

468
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:26,010
you fucking asshole?

469
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,610
What are you doing here?

470
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,329
Why are you here?

471
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,409
Oh, I'm getting herbs.

472
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:31,989
Oh, shut up.

473
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:33,909
Oh, you got how many stacks of herbs do you need?

474
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:38,059
I don't know, like six or 7,000.

475
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:41,019
You've been here since four o'clock in the afternoon.

476
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,420
It is now like midnight.

477
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,949
And I log back on you're still here killing people.

478
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,269
I'm just getting herbs, man.

479
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:49,110
No, you're not.

480
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:55,179
That's such a dumb excuse.

481
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:56,019
Well, not Angoro.

482
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:57,380
Angoro was contested, right?

483
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,219
I remember there was one of them

484
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:00,139
where he was just like, what are you doing here?

485
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:01,380
Strangle, there you are.

486
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,579
Strangle Thornvale.

487
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:04,699
Strangle Thornvale.

488
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,340
People just stayed there.

489
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,900
They didn't leave.

490
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,179
They would be there at level 60.

491
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,980
It's like a level 30 zone.

492
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,050
And they would just stay there permanently.

493
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,010
I don't even know if they played the rest of the game.

494
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:24,409
They got to 60 and went right to Strangle Thorn.

495
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:25,650
What's he talking about?

496
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,619
People that, no, no.

497
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:36,869
Oh, I'm gonna starve.

498
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,110
Karin is too strong.

499
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,860
Oh no, not the snail.

500
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,269
Actually, this might be good.

501
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:49,110
I'm just gonna stay in the bottom.

502
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,690
You just gotta get lucky.

503
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,179
Thanks for the help.

504
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,539
I'm gonna die.

505
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:01,309
Okay, I need to focus.

506
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:05,349
This game is just like Slither.io, okay?

507
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:07,469
You just walk around in a circle

508
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:10,349
until one of the big people die.

509
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:12,510
And then you try to inhale as much as possible

510
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,989
and not be one of the 10 people that run into each other.

511
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:18,190
And then you get to be the big, big dog, right?

512
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:22,730
For a little while.

513
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:24,010
We gotta stay.

514
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,659
I wanna do this.

515
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:28,820
Why are the green ones so aggressive?

516
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,460
You're just gonna die.

517
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:41,619
Come on, dude.

518
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:43,260
All right, enough, enough, enough, enough.

519
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,099
We're not fighting here.

520
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,769
We're, you're fighting babies.

521
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:53,550
You're so tough.

522
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,230
These are infant children that you are fighting

523
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,280
as a group of adults.

524
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,960
Get out of here.

525
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,219
You should not be here.

526
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:08,519
Imagine going to the like, the peewee leagues

527
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,920
as like a fucking 40 year old man

528
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,800
and full sprint tackling like a fucking 11 year old

529
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,199
and getting up and being like, yeah!

530
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:19,400
And like high-fiving your other 40 year old friend

531
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,139
that's there too.

532
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:25,969
That's what's happening right now.

533
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,210
You suck at this.

534
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,530
This game's hard.

535
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,369
Will he reach?

536
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:38,130
Stop, you don't have to gamble if I'm gonna make it.

537
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,969
This is, all right, when I get big enough,

538
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:45,679
I'm coming back here and we're gonna bully this person.

539
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:47,719
Just wait till I type into general,

540
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:50,679
just wait till I type into trade chat in Ironforge.

541
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,840
Somebody please come kill this level 60 undead rogue

542
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,170
that won't leave.

543
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,969
And you get somebody who's like, oh, help, what?

544
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:58,809
What's what?

545
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,849
Hey, like get, you get like the party invite.

546
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:03,570
Oh, it's like a level 60.

547
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,050
It's a paladin.

548
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,929
Paladins in WoW, back in classic WoW,

549
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:08,769
if it was a paladin that responded,

550
00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:10,090
they were gonna like LARP in RP

551
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,489
and they were gonna help you.

552
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:14,699
It was always a paladin.

553
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:17,179
And then they would show up and they would point.

554
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:18,900
They would do the slash point

555
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,610
and then get absolutely eviscerated.

556
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:27,380
I already got sucked into the thing.

557
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,300
They would get eviscerated.

558
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,380
It was not even a contest,

559
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,300
but it was long enough for you to like get out of the way

560
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:39,099
and now it was his problem or it was her problem.

561
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:40,340
And then somebody would be like,

562
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,380
that person would go, no, no, no, no, no, fuck this.

563
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,420
I'll be right back.

564
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,780
They would log out of that paladin

565
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,210
and they'd come back on like a shadow priest.

566
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:56,070
That's all decked out in like tier two gear.

567
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:07,139
All the while, you just want,

568
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:16,949
God, I'm mad at this fish.

569
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:17,789
Stop talking.

570
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:18,630
I know, I know.

571
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,449
All right, no more talking.

572
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,440
I'm not gonna speak this whole time.

573
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,760
I'm not gonna speak this whole time.

574
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,719
I'm gonna get to level three right now.

575
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:31,340
Okay.

576
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,179
Is there a map?

577
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:38,360
Cause I want to mark on the map where this is.

578
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,969
All right.

579
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:42,590
Stop pushing me.

580
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:48,989
No, don't go that way.

581
00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:52,820
Oh, I haven't blinked in like 40 minutes.

582
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,659
That's mine.

583
00:45:53,659 --> 00:46:12,340
Don't touch that.

584
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,659
Thank God, you idiot.

585
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,849
I got 20 XP because he died.

586
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:22,159
That's so stupid.

587
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:23,599
No, I stopped paying attention.

588
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:24,760
You're laughing at the guy.

589
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,579
Oh, it's all right.

590
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,280
I'm okay.

591
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,840
Please, God damn it, man.

592
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,559
I am so, I can't play this game.

593
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,400
It takes too much focus.

594
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,719
Put both headphones in.

595
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,199
Just don't talk about World of Warcraft.

596
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,440
Don't talk about Mario.

597
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,099
Don't talk about anything besides focusing on the game.

598
00:46:51,099 --> 00:47:02,320
Give me some of my drink.

599
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,800
I moved you guys over here.

600
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:11,500
You used to be over there, but now you're over here.

601
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:30,039
I'm going full immersion mode this round.

602
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:31,440
We can take them.

603
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,280
We can take them.

604
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,119
We can take them.

605
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,719
We can take them.

606
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:38,969
We can take them.

607
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:48,880
We can take them.

608
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,219
Did we get it?

609
00:47:50,219 --> 00:48:11,719
You ate it.

610
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:20,550
Go get your own food.

611
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,199
Go get your own food.

612
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,050
Is that Carl?

613
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,730
I don't, I mean, there are 400 million of us

614
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,170
that were just born like an hour ago.

615
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:47,719
I don't know who, you could be, you might be Carl.

616
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:48,860
Points, what?

617
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,699
Easy money.

618
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:53,400
What?

619
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,239
What do you mean easy money?

620
00:48:54,239 --> 00:49:09,559
What did you guys just do?

621
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:10,519
Come here.

622
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:14,809
These ones are fucking fast.

623
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:19,340
We have to get this, otherwise we're gonna die.

624
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:25,570
Don't eat it all.

625
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:59,489
If you eat that all, I swear to God.

626
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:09,889
Oh, that's a juicy one.

627
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:10,730
Holy shit.

628
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:11,570
Oh my God.

629
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,679
Am I, am I all right?

630
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,360
That was, that was bad.

631
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,960
That was very bad.

632
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,769
How does it, I'm sorry.

633
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:20,090
I'm actually sorry about that.

634
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:23,730
I actually freaked the fuck out.

635
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,590
How do I repair?

636
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:30,820
Can I heal?

637
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,860
Get, no, stop.

638
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,719
Get away from me.

639
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:35,559
I'm so close.

640
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:36,639
No, I'm so close.

641
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:47,289
Where's my, no, my God.

642
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:54,409
I, I know where this is Omega gaming weekend,

643
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:56,809
but I'm playing this a little more.

644
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:59,239
I'm not leaving yet.

645
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:05,070
Not on a note like this.

646
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:13,480
This guy's such a scumbag.

647
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:18,400
That fish is on a patrol to just eat children.

648
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,460
Really?

649
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,840
Don't go that way.

650
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah, I'm just gonna come back every few hours

651
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,340
and see how many more children I can eat.

652
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,380
That's a pit stop.

653
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,480
He's stopping on his way back home.

654
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:48,289
Oh, let's eat some more big children.

655
00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:53,869
I love how they can just like hit their heads.

656
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:56,829
It's like I caught him and he was so startled

657
00:51:56,829 --> 00:52:03,760
that I caught him what he was doing that he freaked out.

658
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,760
Here's some snacks over here.

659
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,599
Good.

660
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:24,469
We're good.

661
00:52:24,469 --> 00:52:28,670
Can somebody confirm just dashing?

662
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,349
It does dashing take food.

663
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:37,340
I haven't really been able to see it.

664
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:44,280
It's leveling up is what's doing that.

665
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,940
Okay.

666
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:55,719
I'm not going anywhere without full food.

667
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:02,030
Where is everybody?

668
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:06,710
Where'd everybody go?

669
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:12,000
Did they all go into that waterfall section?

670
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,940
Level three, bro, coming up.

671
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,780
Please die.

672
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:29,239
I don't think it's gonna happen this time.

673
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:34,510
Don't get overconfident.

674
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:35,829
All of the big fish I think have left

675
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:38,090
to go to the second area.

676
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:42,699
I think it'll be all right.

677
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:44,659
I have a never ending supply of bugs.

678
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:49,329
Why did I just lose hunger?

679
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:50,650
What just happened?

680
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:03,349
That was weird.

681
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:04,190
Honestly, I think I lucked out here.

682
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,659
The RNG went nuts and I think it sucked every single fish

683
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:16,579
into that second part, except for you.

684
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:17,900
I'm level three.

685
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,559
What do I do?

686
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:20,440
Should I go after him?

687
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,059
No, not yet.

688
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:40,030
I'm still gonna eat bugs for a little while.

689
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,369
What's that?

690
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:46,989
Oh, it's a shrimp.

691
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:50,909
Am I ready for the next zone?

692
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:55,000
Not yet.

693
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:02,219
What was that?

694
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:09,679
What was that?

695
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:11,329
That big guy is still here.

696
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:25,480
I just saw him.

697
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:44,599
Yeah, I'm being complete patient only.

698
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:46,559
Did everyone left?

699
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:47,519
I'm gonna go through the waterfall

700
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:49,090
and it's gonna be mayhem.

701
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:57,789
I'm almost level four.

702
00:55:57,789 --> 00:56:00,789
Wait.

703
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:01,969
Wait a minute.

704
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:05,980
That wasn't, we were trying to kill that.

705
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,019
There was at least a few times where we were biting.

706
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:09,460
I was biting and attacking this

707
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,420
and it was, I think it was my mother.

708
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:16,260
It wasn't coming back every hour to eat the children.

709
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,460
It was coming back to take care of us and protect us.

710
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,300
Oh boy.

711
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,059
All right, don't lose this.

712
00:56:23,059 --> 00:56:24,860
Where do I go?

713
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:28,840
Oh, I'm gonna be on a frenzy here.

714
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,900
Where do I go?

715
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:38,880
Where's the waterfall?

716
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,340
Ow.

717
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,159
Where's the waterfall?

718
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:47,429
Where's the waterfall?

719
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:48,269
Where's the waterfall?

720
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:49,090
All right, let's go.

721
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:49,929
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

722
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:54,860
I'm so much bigger than everybody.

723
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,980
Let's go.

724
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,579
Oh, hey, what's going on?

725
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:25,099
Remember me?

726
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:26,139
It's not fair.

727
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:28,260
These guys are huge.

728
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:55,539
What?

729
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:56,579
Choosing different fish.

730
00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:00,920
It's not working.

731
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,920
That was not working.

732
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:09,570
Different fish.

733
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,969
So I was screaming like this was a horror game

734
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:17,760
at the mother coming back every time.

735
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:30,530
That's so stupid.

736
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:33,090
Aren't you, no, you're, no.

737
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,329
Where are you people coming from?

738
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:44,099
Where are all these people coming from?

739
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:45,099
Where were they even coming from?

740
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:57,130
I don't get it.

741
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:05,489
I'm going to the swamp.

742
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:06,329
What's crab madness?

743
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:10,219
I don't know.

744
00:59:10,219 --> 00:59:15,900
There's probably different fishes here.

745
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,900
Wait, I can be the dinosaur?

746
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:29,730
All right, I want to be the alligator.

747
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:33,909
That was a different species, by the way.

748
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:40,179
The thing that I thought was a shiny special green one.

749
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:45,440
No, that's why it was so aggressive.

750
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,000
I thought it was one of my friends.

751
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,380
I should have just eaten them.

752
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:53,260
All right, let's move.

753
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,239
Is the strategy to stay with the mother?

754
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:06,300
Yeah, of course it is.

755
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,460
No shit.

756
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,380
Really?

757
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,980
You got to be kidding me.

758
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,659
This is the, okay.

759
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:17,460
Mom, where'd mom go?

760
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:40,690
Let me have some.

761
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:42,650
This is what I should have been doing the whole time.

762
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,570
Are you kidding me?

763
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,889
That's so frustrating.

764
01:00:45,889 --> 01:00:51,190
I'm level two already.

765
01:00:51,190 --> 01:01:00,119
Mom, don't leave us.

766
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:07,289
Mom, mom.

767
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:12,030
Oh, what do we do now?

768
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:27,539
Oh, we got to stick together.

769
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:32,630
I don't know what to do.

770
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:33,750
I think we can kill that.

771
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:41,829
I'm starving.

772
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:42,670
Drink the blood.

773
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:54,929
Can I drink the blood?

774
01:01:54,929 --> 01:01:59,469
Do not eat that.

775
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:00,309
You piece of shit.

776
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:05,239
I swear to God, you better not get that.

777
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:09,030
Get him, get him, come on.

778
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:12,980
Good job, good fight, good fight.

779
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:17,019
Retreating, retreating, retreating, retreating, retreating.

780
01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:18,739
I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him, I'm on him,

781
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:23,860
on him, on him, on him, on him, on him.

782
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:26,949
Retreating.

783
01:02:26,949 --> 01:02:30,010
Stunning, stunning.

784
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,170
Consecrating, consecrating, I got consecration.

785
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:34,190
Stun.

786
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,309
I got to shrink it, I got to shrink it out.

787
01:02:35,309 --> 01:02:38,449
Trink it out, trick it out, trick it out.

788
01:02:38,449 --> 01:02:42,840
I need shield, I need power shield.

789
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,579
Got to stun.

790
01:02:45,579 --> 01:02:48,780
You fucking idiot.

791
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,510
Stop.

792
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:55,079
I don't even know where I am.

793
01:02:55,079 --> 01:03:13,269
Where am I?

794
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:15,559
Can I eat you just whole or what?

795
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:17,590
No, but I can kill you though.

796
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:22,900
Can't I just grab?

797
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:29,190
It's so hard to fucking aim.

798
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,980
Dude, eat him.

799
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,260
You're right next to him.

800
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,420
Eat him.

801
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:38,579
How hard is it to grab?

802
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:45,880
Just eat him.

803
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,150
Eat, eat that.

804
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:52,639
Eat that.

805
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:55,320
Eat that.

806
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,349
Eat that.

807
01:03:59,349 --> 01:04:00,349
Eat that.

808
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:16,320
Eat that.

809
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:38,139
Eat it.

810
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:40,190
I don't think I'm ever gonna make it.

811
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,030
Poisonous fish?

812
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:46,530
I was wondering, was I allergic to that food?

813
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:48,329
I don't appreciate you calling me a cigarette, Andy.

814
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:54,699
I want an apology.

815
01:04:54,699 --> 01:04:57,489
Whoa, is that a catfish?

816
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:59,500
All right, where's mom?

817
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,389
Mom, are you gonna fight the catfish?

818
01:05:02,389 --> 01:05:03,230
I think so.

819
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:07,699
Are we gonna get a battle?

820
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:15,210
All right, this time don't lose the mom.

821
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:26,900
This is gonna be insane amount of food.

822
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,980
Can I have some or what?

823
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:30,820
Really guys?

824
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,179
Really?

825
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:34,059
That's so, you're ridiculous.

826
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:35,699
I can't, well, that was an entire,

827
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:39,070
that was like 10 months worth of food.

828
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:44,699
Where's mom?

829
01:05:44,699 --> 01:05:46,340
That's not, that's not my mom.

830
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:58,590
That's not mom.

831
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:05,150
All right, dude, get, really?

832
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:06,750
I wish there was a horn I could do like.

833
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:23,940
You gonna let me have some?

834
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:30,409
I'm gonna starve.

835
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:31,250
It has to be broken down to eat,

836
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:36,900
but by the time it gets broken down, she just eats it.

837
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,130
Somebody said, dude, is this what fish do all day?

838
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,590
Yeah.

839
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:42,590
Yeah, dude.

840
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:53,320
Yeah.

841
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,599
And can you eat something?

842
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,000
Can you please kill something for me?

843
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,900
Did you kill everything already?

844
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,659
And now I'm just gonna starve to death next to you.

845
01:06:59,659 --> 01:07:09,309
And then you're probably gonna eat me.

846
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:12,989
No, mom, mom, mom.

847
01:07:12,989 --> 01:07:16,190
Ah, I need to eat, I'm sorry.

848
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:23,670
Oh my God, oh my God, I'm fucking traumatized for life.

849
01:07:23,949 --> 01:07:26,309
I'm traumatized for life.

850
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:29,199
Is there, are you a friend?

851
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:31,280
What are, what the hell is that?

852
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,199
What is this thing?

853
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:33,039
Are you, can you help me?

854
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,639
Can we be friends?

855
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:37,559
You don't seem hostile, but maybe you can help me.

856
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:54,210
There's a big scary guppy out there, Lariat.

857
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,050
Come on.

858
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:59,199
Oh, that was so terrible.

859
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:00,840
That was so sad.

860
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:07,800
Oh, I didn't like any of that.

861
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,199
No, I'm not big enough.

862
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,320
I'm about to die.

863
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,190
I wonder if there's a heal.

864
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:16,430
Maybe if I, it's like Minecraft,

865
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:21,649
if I have full hunger, I can heal.

866
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:27,569
Let's test that theory.

867
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:31,869
That theory testing.

868
01:08:31,869 --> 01:08:32,710
Where's my friend?

869
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:35,390
I had a friend down here, where is he?

870
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:37,340
Where's my friend?

871
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,699
Oh shit.

872
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:48,510
I did heal, okay.

873
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:49,829
I'm bleeding, I think.

874
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:53,279
Oh, this is not good.

875
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,770
You can smell that, can't you?

876
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,680
Friendly?

877
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,770
No, that's the bastard that killed my mother.

878
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:04,770
No, don't do it, don't do it.

879
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,090
You're not strong enough.

880
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:06,930
Ah!

881
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:11,630
Ah!

882
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:21,029
What's he doing?

883
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:22,710
No, he's not gonna be able to do it.

884
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:46,399
Turn the music down, it's too loud.

885
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:48,239
All right, this time,

886
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:49,640
I thought that was a giant whale or something.

887
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,279
All right, this, I need to eat.

888
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,020
Stop eating all the food.

889
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,970
I have to just be quick.

890
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,569
If you're gonna do the mom strat,

891
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,010
then you have to really, really be right.

892
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:28,500
I'm just gonna spam right click.

893
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:33,140
Okay, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.

894
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,380
Holy shit.

895
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:38,880
That's so much food for everybody.

896
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:44,859
There's food for everyone here.

897
01:10:44,859 --> 01:10:45,699
All right, we're good, we're good, we're good,

898
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:47,020
we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.

899
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,359
Oh my God, I'm level three.

900
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:50,199
Where'd mom go?

901
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:55,140
I'm too big to look.

902
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,859
No, don't bite mom, you stupid.

903
01:10:57,739 --> 01:11:24,760
Get that one too, mom.

904
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:32,250
Nice, nice one.

905
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:35,100
Yes, all right, I'm good.

906
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:40,560
I'm gonna stick together though, I think.

907
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,560
Okay, I need to eat all this stuff

908
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,760
and then I need to have children.

909
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,789
I think that's a good idea.

910
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:54,340
That's a huge grip.

911
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,899
I don't think I need to stick together.

912
01:11:55,899 --> 01:12:06,380
I'm a absolute carnivore, aren't I?

913
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:09,199
I'm so bad at this.

914
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:21,369
Mom, I actually still need your help.

915
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:26,859
There you go.

916
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:28,460
This is like some other thing.

917
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,060
This is another turf, right?

918
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:40,939
All right, hold on.

919
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:44,699
Hey, well, I guess that's fair, that's fair.

920
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:45,539
What about this thing?

921
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:55,590
Why does that hurt?

922
01:12:55,590 --> 01:13:08,720
Why does it hurt me?

923
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,560
It has spines?

924
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:15,619
Oh, shit, okay.

925
01:13:15,619 --> 01:13:19,069
I need to move to a different place.

926
01:13:19,069 --> 01:13:19,909
Who's that?

927
01:13:19,909 --> 01:13:23,439
Oh, that's a meaty fish.

928
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:32,739
Hey, I can't kill that.

929
01:13:32,739 --> 01:13:35,420
Why not?

930
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:44,630
Too big?

931
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:56,210
No, come here.

932
01:13:56,210 --> 01:14:00,819
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

933
01:14:00,819 --> 01:14:02,960
Depth perception.

934
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:10,439
It's hard to land hits.

935
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:13,670
Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

936
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:30,659
Crab, nice.

937
01:14:30,659 --> 01:14:32,979
You piece of shit.

938
01:14:32,979 --> 01:14:35,619
All right, I gotta hide because I need to heal.

939
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:47,090
Any more crabs?

940
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:48,529
Ooh, all right, all right, all right.

941
01:14:48,529 --> 01:14:50,100
Let me help you.

942
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,739
Holy shit, it's an omega snake.

943
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:30,659
Where are these other fish that I need to eat?

944
01:15:30,659 --> 01:16:04,819
I was level six.

945
01:16:04,819 --> 01:16:07,239
It was rocks?

946
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:09,340
Looks like shit.

947
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:29,829
Okay, let's go over here.

948
01:16:29,829 --> 01:16:37,420
What is that stuff?

949
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:43,739
Why is the music changing?

950
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:46,979
Mine, my food now.

951
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:48,399
Where you wanna go?

952
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:49,640
Level seven.

953
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,840
You wanna go?

954
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,279
Which one?

955
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:54,140
Oh, I remember you.

956
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,340
You remember me?

957
01:16:55,340 --> 01:17:00,840
I watched you kill my mother.

958
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,000
All right, I'm done, the game's over.

959
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:09,239
I'm done, I'm actually done playing the game.

960
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:11,140
That was fun.

961
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:29,609
That was fun, that sucked.

962
01:17:29,609 --> 01:17:37,600
I'll try a death match.

963
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,479
What should I play after this?

964
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:43,340
I got a lot.

965
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:51,819
Anything else you guys wanna see from that initial list?

966
01:17:51,819 --> 01:17:53,289
How do I join?

967
01:17:53,289 --> 01:17:56,260
Fish select.

968
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:59,029
Wait, you can be a stingray?

969
01:17:59,029 --> 01:18:00,750
Puffer fish?

970
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:04,840
I have no coins.

971
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,560
Are you kidding me?

972
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,250
Wait a minute.

973
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:12,949
What's free?

974
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:28,710
How did I not get any coins at all from the survival mode?

975
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:39,640
That kind of messed up.

976
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,039
I'm not the brightest, I guess I'm dead.

977
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:46,100
I thought I could eat it.

978
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,880
The death match, I didn't even need death match.

979
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:54,390
It just detached me.

980
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:57,289
What's the first thing you do when you spawn in?

981
01:18:57,289 --> 01:19:11,619
Spike myself in the chest, okay?

982
01:19:11,619 --> 01:19:13,779
What are these, real?

983
01:19:13,779 --> 01:19:15,579
These are not real fishes, right?

984
01:19:15,579 --> 01:19:22,270
What is this?

985
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:26,630
These are cartoon characters.

986
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:28,149
They don't, fish don't look like this.

987
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:40,430
These are fucking cartoons.

988
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:44,779
A fish doesn't look like this.

989
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:46,220
Is this like an Easter egg?

990
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,939
Like, oh look, it's something from Finding Nemo

991
01:19:47,939 --> 01:20:09,609
or something.

992
01:20:09,609 --> 01:20:20,079
Are you dead yet?

993
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:21,619
They won't die.

994
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:36,060
They won't die.

995
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,899
Smiling at me and die.

996
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:46,970
Oh my goodness, why?

997
01:20:47,569 --> 01:20:59,920
Some death match, this turned out to be.

998
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:47,579
I've taken all the skin off of its back.

999
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:56,340
I guess I can kill you, microscopic plankton.

1000
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:12,649
I don't know if I'm satisfied with that one.

1001
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:37,579
Where is everybody?

1002
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:57,750
Oh, SpongeBob.

1003
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:00,619
He's farming minus twos.

1004
01:23:00,619 --> 01:23:20,199
Yep.

1005
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:22,479
I'm sitting here thinking,

1006
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:27,100
they just kind of do the same thing over and over again.

1007
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,720
The same thing forever.

1008
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,890
I go, wow, what are these things are dumb?

1009
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,689
And then I think about the amount of games

1010
01:23:34,689 --> 01:23:37,579
of Hearthstone Battlegrounds I've played

1011
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:40,789
where I pick elemental every time.

1012
01:23:40,789 --> 01:23:47,590
And I've done that hundreds, if not thousands of times.

1013
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:48,869
We're not so different.

1014
01:23:48,869 --> 01:23:56,369
We're very alike.

1015
01:23:56,369 --> 01:24:09,739
All right, well, here's my group.

1016
01:24:09,739 --> 01:24:10,579
You should stream it.

1017
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:12,550
No, I won't.

1018
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,109
Hearthstone Battlegrounds is one of those games

1019
01:24:14,109 --> 01:24:17,189
where that's a game that it's just for me.

1020
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:19,670
Because if I stream it, I'll be embarrassed.

1021
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:22,569
I'll think of every play I did.

1022
01:24:22,569 --> 01:24:24,170
And I'll think of the person making fun of me

1023
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:27,500
because they played better than I am at the game

1024
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,840
and they know way more.

1025
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,619
Okay, I'm back.

1026
01:24:33,619 --> 01:24:54,640
We're back and we're bigger.

1027
01:24:54,640 --> 01:25:02,140
Still won't die.

1028
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:09,369
0.4 damage.

1029
01:25:09,369 --> 01:25:13,659
Let's leave.

1030
01:25:13,659 --> 01:25:16,510
How is this death match?

1031
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:18,670
It's me and two of these other bluefish

1032
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:23,060
versus the weird clownfish over there.

1033
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:27,260
And a stingray.

1034
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,579
This is not a death match.

1035
01:25:28,579 --> 01:25:35,199
This is just, we're just hanging out in different spots.

1036
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:45,180
What's going on over here?

1037
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,739
Ow, get it off, get it off me, get it off, get it off me,

1038
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:47,579
get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off,

1039
01:25:47,579 --> 01:25:48,779
get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off,

1040
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:49,859
get it off, get it off, get it off me, get it off me,

1041
01:25:49,859 --> 01:25:50,699
get it off me, get it off me.

1042
01:25:50,699 --> 01:26:23,859
There are whales, help, help!

1043
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:26,899
Who is this supposed to be?

1044
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:37,289
Oh, who's in there?

1045
01:26:37,289 --> 01:26:39,250
They were hiding.

1046
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:45,039
All right, new, we're gonna be Bilbo.

1047
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:46,840
Okay, what is this?

1048
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,789
You don't have a gang.

1049
01:26:48,789 --> 01:26:56,590
Yeah, I do.

1050
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:59,529
Are we piranhas?

1051
01:26:59,529 --> 01:27:02,770
I think we are piranhas.

1052
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:08,319
I'm not in this gang.

1053
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:16,699
Why not?

1054
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:27,770
Are we gonna go swarm something?

1055
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:33,520
Swarm him, swarm him, help me!

1056
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:42,279
I was gonna say he eats, like auto eats dog treats.

1057
01:27:42,279 --> 01:27:45,079
This feels kind of unfair

1058
01:27:45,079 --> 01:27:49,260
that the gang is just free food.

1059
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:59,810
One more.

1060
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:01,729
That's it, I'm done.

1061
01:28:01,729 --> 01:28:02,550
I'm done.

1062
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:06,779
Like how are we supposed to fight against tiger sharks?

1063
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:08,380
How is this fair at all?

1064
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,859
This is not a death match, this is bully.

1065
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:11,699
What, how?

1066
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:21,760
What are we supposed to do about this?

1067
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,470
Who are they going after?

1068
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:43,340
I need, oh, I got a coin, you're right.

1069
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:46,229
This is cool.

1070
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:50,109
Okay, aren't stingrays like the true neutral of the ocean?

1071
01:28:50,109 --> 01:28:52,289
Like nobody cares, right?

1072
01:28:52,289 --> 01:29:02,890
Stingrays just kind of float around.

1073
01:29:02,890 --> 01:29:12,859
I don't have any coins left.

1074
01:29:12,859 --> 01:29:15,140
I thought that stingrays just kind of floated around

1075
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:23,170
and if you just left, sharks eat stingrays?

1076
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:25,090
Don't stingrays just like open their mouths

1077
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:28,720
and eat like the dust of the ocean?

1078
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:35,659
Do crab madness, all right.

1079
01:29:35,659 --> 01:29:36,699
What is that?

1080
01:29:36,699 --> 01:29:50,920
How do I play with that?

1081
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,909
I know I'm breaking the rule.

1082
01:29:53,909 --> 01:29:56,069
The rule is we play these 30 to 40 minutes,

1083
01:29:56,069 --> 01:29:58,340
maybe one hour tops.

1084
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:06,010
I got interested, I'm sorry.

1085
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:09,340
Oh, you can do that.

1086
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:14,020
There it is.

1087
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:24,409
Whoa, there's more too.

1088
01:30:24,409 --> 01:30:28,300
Dunklesaurus?

1089
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:34,640
I wanna play with these.

1090
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:45,180
Oh, really?

1091
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:48,760
That's cool looking.

1092
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,159
This game was actually pretty fun.

1093
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:58,460
This game was cool.

1094
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:59,279
All right, well, that's cool.

1095
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:05,539
That was feed and grow fish.

1096
01:31:05,539 --> 01:31:06,380
Where are we going from here?

1097
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:11,289
From here, okay, I'm gonna give you some options.

1098
01:31:11,289 --> 01:31:12,590
I'm gonna decide which one.

1099
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:15,239
20 minutes till dawn.

1100
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:16,800
I kind of feel like playing that right now.

1101
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,930
20 minutes till dawn.

1102
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:21,010
Oh, I could just do this

1103
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:25,060
and make like a few thousand people leave maybe.

1104
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:26,420
I'm gonna play 20 minutes till dawn.

1105
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:28,210
I'm gonna get it out of my system

1106
01:31:28,210 --> 01:31:29,409
and then I'm gonna probably have,

1107
01:31:29,409 --> 01:31:30,729
there's probably like three or 4,000 people

1108
01:31:30,729 --> 01:31:34,420
are gonna leave after that is what comes after that.

1109
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:40,319
All right, that was fun.

1110
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:42,739
That was feed and grow fish, that was fun.

1111
01:31:42,739 --> 01:31:43,859
I don't know how,

1112
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:46,619
what the stage of development on that game is,

1113
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:47,819
but it was fun.
