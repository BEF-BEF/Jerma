1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:16,780
Hello. Hi. How are you? Oh, hello. Want to start at 12, but it's 12.30. Whatever. It's a couple.

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:26,460
Ah, it's a half hour. It's all right. Bear with me for a second. I'm going to make everybody very upset,

3
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:37,140
okay? Well, actually, not really. Not really. I know that today I was going to stream yesterday

4
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,479
modded Skyrim. I was thinking about it. Some of the mods and some of the people in the community

5
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:50,060
have helped put together a list of a hundred something mods for Skyrim. I spent the better

6
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:58,789
half of the last day or so for getting them all. And I, some of them don't work. Some of them

7
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:06,120
fuck up the game. So it's going to take a little bit longer. And, and not only will there be a

8
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:14,040
shitload of mods on that Skyrim mod mayhem night, I think I'm actually going to get access to

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,939
Ghost Commander, or if you don't know Ghost Commander, Kraken. Kraken's extension for

10
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:25,480
Skyrim. So it's good that we're going to take a little bit longer because we'll get access

11
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,989
to that too, probably. Just going to let it sit for a little bit. I want to get some more mods,

12
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:38,099
make sure they all work. Because I, okay, I opened up the game and I had literally no idea

13
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,150
what was going on. It was just a mess. And I'm like, is this like, this is going to be funny

14
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,549
for five seconds. They need, they need a little bit more time in the oven. Okay. Let's just put

15
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,379
it that way. It's, it would have been funny for literally five seconds and we all would have gone,

16
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,459
oh, that's crazy. That's funny. All right. Well now what? So I'd rather have more elaborate things

17
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:04,920
going on and get some more, more time on it. So today, I don't have very much time today.

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,650
I've got a lot of things going on over the next few days into the weekend, but I did want to hang

19
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:17,400
out and we're going to do something called a comb stream. A lot of new viewers. Look at all these

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:25,689
new viewers that don't know what this is. When did you start watching? 2018? Please don't leave.

21
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:31,050
Like you've been incredible for the channel and the community's grown immensely. So like you guys

22
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,210
are awesome. Thanks for coming. A comb stream is, is this. Well, hold on. Let me tweet it first.

23
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:58,789
Hold on. Oh, give me a second. I'll be right back. What the fuck is this new Twitter shit?

24
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:05,900
I'm writing a tweet and it's like public or what do you mean public? What are you talking about?

25
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:13,189
This is freaking me out. I don't like this. This is a new feature on Twitter. What is this? Public

26
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:23,560
or my Twitter circle. What the fuck does that mean? I don't have a Twitter circle. What?

27
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:42,629
Okay. Anyways, uh, short hangout stream. Come say hi with a big smiley face.

28
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:56,870
It's so funny. All right. I'm so sorry, but listen, this is kind of funny. So if you've been

29
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:01,590
a few days ago, two or three days ago, right? When I last streamed, it's like, oh, mod night.

30
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,430
I'm going to get modded GTA, modded Elden Ring, modded Skyrim. It's going to be fucking crazy.

31
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,629
Mod night, hundreds of mods. It's going to be insane. And, and you don't, you know, you don't

32
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:20,060
pay any attention after that. And you see on Twitter here, short hangout stream. Come say hi.

33
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:29,209
Like what? What are you, what are you talking about? Where that's what you're doing today?

34
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:40,779
A short hangout stream, but I got a baseball update for you. So before we get started,

35
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:47,500
baseball, if you don't know baseball's seen a little bit of a rocky road here. Um, they had

36
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:55,750
some venue problems trying to still get the show paid for. It's been kind of rough with the show

37
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,949
creatively. This thing's ready to go. It's ready. It's been ready for a long fucking time.

38
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:11,240
But we keep running into problems, but I think I can safely say it's still happening in July.

39
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,180
We're really trying to really lock in the 24th, July 24th. And I think I mean it this time.

40
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:28,339
We just, behind the scenes is a lot going on and it's been pretty stressful. Nothing I really,

41
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:34,819
really speak of on stream. Uh, but we've had multiple different issues with trying to,

42
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:41,850
like I said, get the show paid for and get the right venue for it. And it's, we've gone back

43
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:49,459
and forth. It's been kind of a mess, but July 24th is the new day that we're trying to lock in.

44
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:55,819
And I've really, me and Community Jake obviously have been going back and forth. And with this

45
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:01,860
show, I need to get this show off the ground before August. I ain't, this show is, I'm not

46
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:12,180
canceling this show. There's no way I will do this show in my backyard. Okay. But no,

47
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,620
we're not going to worry about that. Uh, it's going to be a great show. I'm really looking

48
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,139
forward to it. I think it's going to be really, really fun. I think a lot of people are potentially

49
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,339
sleeping on this show. And some people are like, Oh, it's just a baseball show. Who cares? You'll

50
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:32,250
see. It's going to be a really fun time. But, uh, that's that update. Hopefully July 24th.

51
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,389
I just found that out today. I'm on calls, man. Cause I'm on phone calls. You understand? Like

52
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:50,199
it's like, it's every fucking 10 seconds. And I got to call my mother too. I'm not just not

53
00:06:50,199 --> 00:07:01,509
going to call my mother. Oh shit. I forgot to tweet. Hold on. Give me a second. New noise.

54
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:21,399
Now that's the same noise repackaged like three times. Okay. It's a Skype call. No. All right.

55
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,839
So what we're going to do today. Hold on. Let me just clear my throat for a sec. I don't want

56
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:33,370
you to hear that. So today I don't really have a plan and I figured why not just hang out. I don't

57
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,360
have that much time today and I'm trying to get a lot of things off the ground over the next few

58
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,689
days as well. So let's just chill. Let's hang out. Let's do a comb stream. Comb streams are exactly

59
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:58,550
this. How are you? That's where I sit here and I put a comb in my hair and we, we sit her in

60
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:06,649
and do nothing. I'm not kidding. That's what this is. This is what it is. This is what the show is

61
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:20,819
today. I actually did just get a haircut recently. Your cam is skewed. Yeah. Why do I have like a

62
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:29,670
fucking hourglass head? What's happening? This isn't this, this camera. I don't like this new

63
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:41,509
camera. I don't like this new camera. It makes me look weird. I have a five head. It really does

64
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:46,629
look weird. I don't understand this camera and this thing was expensive. This was not cheap.

65
00:08:46,629 --> 00:09:06,539
Did you have a wig on? No, I just, just got my haircut. What do you guys think? I'm a fucking

66
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:15,029
weird looking guy. You got the same comb. All right. I also shaved too. So that's why I just

67
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:23,379
look equally as different. 144 P Andy. This camera is not 144 P. This camera is very expensive and

68
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:31,700
it's very high quality. You look like 20. Well, good. Cause when I'm 50, I'll look 40 and that

69
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:39,769
makes me happy. When I'm 55 years old, I'll be, I'll be 30. You look strange and off putting,

70
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:48,820
but because I got fucking messed up hair, I just got, okay, let me ask you a question. Those of

71
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:55,559
you that get your hair cut every time I get my haircut, the first three days of the force,

72
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:02,710
the first like five days, I look horrible. I hate the way I look and I need my hair has to grow out

73
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:08,970
into the haircut for like a week before I look like a normal person. Does that make sense? So I

74
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,490
need to wait a week for this to grow up for me to look like a normal human being. Do you have lip

75
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:29,769
gloss on? Yes. Sure. It's coconut lip balm. Okay. Get the correct cut next time. There's no correct

76
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:41,720
haircut. Get the correct haircut next time. I got to get my haircut however I want. It also doesn't

77
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,620
help, right? Here's another thing. So it doesn't help that I have a new hairstylist every single

78
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:58,470
time I get a haircut and I get a card every time. So I go in to get my haircut because I last minute

79
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,250
Andy, right? I don't get my haircut for two or three months and I go, fuck man, I really need a

80
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,190
haircut. Okay. So let me get a haircut. I guess I'm going to see if I can do, can anybody do a walk

81
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:19,159
in today? And I do a walk in today every single time I need to get my haircut. I know. And I keep

82
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:29,990
saying I don't want to do that anymore. I go to, I go to a salon. I don't go to a barber. Just don't

83
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:40,070
do that. Just get a dedicated stylist. I say that every time, but it never happens because two months

84
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:47,500
will go by and I just, I don't care about my haircut anymore. So I just forget and I don't care. And

85
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,669
I go, oh, all right. So I need to get my haircut. Oh shit. I want to get my haircut today. Not like

86
00:11:53,669 --> 00:12:03,240
three days from now, not a week from now. You get a bald spot. I mean, I got a, I got a bald head, dude.

87
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:11,960
Relax. What's on the shirt? Oh, that's a half shelves ago. Go big pancake. Your features are

88
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:24,809
too sharp. You look like Dennis Reynolds. No, I'll grow into it. I'll grow into it. And then I do,

89
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:30,019
I have a fresh shaved face. You're lucky I'm on camera like this. You're lucky I'm on camera

90
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:37,940
like this. I always have two days after I shave my face before I go on camera. And this webcam is

91
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,740
weird too. It's extra soft and weird contrast. This is, the camera is weird too. So that's the

92
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:50,870
problem. So what is a comb stream? We're just going to sit here and I'm going to just take your

93
00:12:50,870 --> 00:13:02,950
questions. Not really. You get a weird head. Yeah, I know. I'm aware of that. It's really great. I

94
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:14,700
don't, I don't know why this thing was expensive too. What if I go like up this way? We're trying

95
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:31,059
a new hairstyle. It's just Donald Trump's hair on my head. You look like a conehead, maybe a little.

96
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:42,860
Is the camera, is the lens dirty? No, I need to grow into it. Fix the settings, please. There are

97
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:58,600
no, I can't fix the camera settings. There are no settings. The settings are so bare bones. I would

98
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,200
have to go get one of those third party programs that nobody wants to go download. Let me ask you

99
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:14,139
a question. Do you go get the third party, like let's say Logitech webcam software and install it

100
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:32,580
and use it? I don't know anybody that does that. How's that? Can we do a Reddit shelf tour? That's

101
00:14:32,580 --> 00:15:01,820
actually a little bit better. Make it darker. What if I do this? It's the same color. Change the

102
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:15,899
sharpness. Drop it or increase it. That, okay, that way that looks way better. Raise it. No,

103
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:27,379
you don't want to raise the sharpness. That look like a fucking VHS tape. Does it like this weird

104
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:36,250
backlight compensation? You're at 985,000 Twitch followers. Holy shit, that's right, I am. Run it

105
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:44,090
through the hue cycle. It's grayed out. It's fine. Whatever. I don't care. I don't think I care about

106
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:57,210
the camera. It's a new, you know, it's a new haircut and I shaved my face literally last night.

107
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:06,570
I have a ring light up here. That thing doesn't really help, really at all. What have I got to

108
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:30,700
have for dinner? Porridge. I think a large porridge. I can't hide. Imagine me with a beard. You look

109
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:53,929
like from the 1930s. AI dungeon looking guy. You look 17. You look like, oh, what did you say?

110
00:16:53,929 --> 00:17:03,350
Do you remember? Hey, me and the boys from our soap were wondering what kind of soap you use

111
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:11,400
to clean your body. Uh, I like Irish spring. What are you talking about? Is this person real? Um,

112
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:21,289
I use just slime soap. I use slime soap. It's just, you know what I mean? It's just the,

113
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:32,230
it doesn't even lather up either. I'm so, my brother used to give me shit for this all the time.

114
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,799
We would have this, you know, the gel, the slime soap, right? And he would get so pissed off

115
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,880
because I would go through it so quickly. And if you like, stop just sliming the soap all over your

116
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,319
body, that's what you're doing. I can tell. Cause it's almost empty every time. So he was, you get

117
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:55,960
mad at me because there was just like this in the shower, there was just the, the gel soap and he

118
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,599
could like tell each week how much I was using. Cause he would pick it up and be like lighter.

119
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,250
He's like, you're sli- you're sliming it all over your body, aren't you? And I'm like,

120
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:15,700
no, I use the loofah. And that was full of shit. I don't use the loofah. I just sli- I just literally

121
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:31,640
slime it all over me. Stop sliming. I know, but it's so much easier. You sli- you're a slime.

122
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:41,319
Yeah. I mean like whatever. Omega lol. There we go. I got an omega lol out of you. You look fake

123
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:49,339
today. I'm not going to go over this anymore. Okay. I had a haircut. I had a clean shaved face

124
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:54,660
and I have a camera that has a permanent soft filter in it and I can't turn it off.

125
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:03,609
I'm going to go get the Logitech controller software. Let's go get it right now. I'm going

126
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:20,089
to go get it right now. What, what, what, what, what, what, what do I need? Stream is derailed.

127
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:24,329
The stream is this, this is the stream. It's just complete derailed. That's the whole thing.

128
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,759
All right. What am I looking for? Logitech webcam software. Wait, is this even a logitech? Yeah,

129
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:46,390
it is. Logitech webcam software. Where's the real germo? All right. Logitech capture video

130
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:56,039
and record software. Okay. Here it is. Download from Mac OS is first before windows. What the

131
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:10,420
fuck? Why do you look so young? Cause you guys never see me with a clean tooth to the bone.

132
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,299
You know what I mean? Like to the skin shaved face. I never let it happen. You never see it

133
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:22,019
ever, ever except for today. Except today. This is when you're seeing it. You're seeing clean,

134
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:37,140
smooth shaved face. I've never do this ever. Do you shave your eyebrows? No, I'm just very pale.

135
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:52,460
Okay. It looks good. I don't like the way that it looked like this. I prefer having a little bit of

136
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:00,019
shade, like a gruff, whatever it is. What was shade? What am I thinking? What's shadow? Five

137
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:11,779
o'clock shadow. Right. Shade. Yeah. I like, I like having a stubble. Yeah. Right. Scruff. Shade.

138
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:25,990
That's fine. Should we try some new hairstyles? What are you guys saying?

139
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:38,859
Dude, should I try like going down with it? Yeah. Eat spaghetti on stream. Oh dude. I was just

140
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:45,430
thinking about eating spaghetti on stream last night. I swear. I was thinking about eating

141
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:54,359
spaghetti on stream. You look like Ace Ventura. That's fine. That's okay. I also have a ring

142
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,359
light here. That's, that's putting even more light in my face, but it has to be there because

143
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:05,940
all webcams have just horseshit awful chips in them. All of them. It's been

144
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:13,579
fucking 10 years and they all look like they're 480p. And I'm sorry. I don't want to, I don't

145
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:17,420
want to plug a DSLR in here and point it at me and have the room heat up another 10 degrees

146
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:29,450
that it already is. Turn it off and let's see. All right. This is without the ring light. This

147
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:46,539
is what it looks like in here. Better? You look like a ghost. This is not better. No way. That

148
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:55,799
makes you look unwell. Well, cause now the white balance is wrong. Do some muscle flexing. All

149
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:14,710
right. This is a 2008 vlog. It really does look like a 2008 vlog. You're right. Turn it on,

150
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:23,049
please. You're scaring my sister. Maybe I, wait, what if I do this? That's, that's much better.

151
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:34,569
Isn't it? That seems like it's better. That's more realistic looking. Yeah. I think that looks

152
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:45,700
better. Yeah. It's a granny ass camera. Whatever. Do you even lift? Uh, not in about seven or eight

153
00:23:45,700 --> 00:24:00,170
years. What if I do this? Hold on. Is it like zoomed in? Maybe that's another reason why.

154
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:08,200
Maybe if I like, that's probably better. What if I go back to see like, this is, this,

155
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:14,119
this looks normal now, right? This is you having the webcam like zoomed in and shit. This is like,

156
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,519
not what a person looks like. They look, this is what you look like now. For real. You look real

157
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:28,230
now. It's like, Hey guys. Hi. It looks weird. It's like people don't have conversations with each

158
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:35,099
other with like the iPhone reverse camera, right? Well, I guess you do with FaceTime, but I'm saying

159
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:39,750
like when you just talking to somebody, I don't look like this in real life. I don't look like

160
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,349
this in real life. You guys know what I look like in real life. You've seen the videos of me from

161
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:54,710
every angle. You have American girl teeth. What are you, what does that, what does that mean?

162
00:24:55,349 --> 00:25:07,900
Exactly. You have American girl teeth. You mean like an American girl doll is what you're describing.

163
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:18,410
They're fake. I'm just like pull out my front teeth. Yeah. I've heard it all, man. You got big

164
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:33,430
teeth. You got a long head. Your nose is too much. I've heard it all. Hey dude, you got a long ass

165
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:42,900
head. That means my fucking brain can fit in here more. It might be squished vertically, but it's in

166
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:58,359
here. You look like a handsome. I don't look like this in real life. I swear to you. I don't look

167
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:02,680
like this in real life. I've got to get the fuck away from this. What you, I got to get away from

168
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,829
this. It's how long have you been streaming for? Like 30 minutes and we're still talking about how

169
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:13,000
I look. I haven't got like, I got kind of a long head. Like, all right. New question, please. New

170
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:25,460
question, please. Will you play five nights at, I'm sorry, will you play long face? Will you play

171
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:37,079
five nights at Freddy's again? No, never. What's my favorite movie? Ghostbusters 2 and then Gremlins

172
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:53,420
2 or depending on the day, Gremlins 2. Dermot, do something crazy. Do you have long nostrils?

173
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:04,390
Maybe a little. What do I think about the rapid growth of the channel in the last year or two?

174
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:17,829
Um, it's cool. It's, I mean, it's cool that more people are here. I just hope I can keep it up.

175
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:24,730
But I'm trying, okay. I'm trying to not just do, to not do anything different, right? It's really

176
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:31,299
easy to kind of, all right, let's real talk for a minute. It's really, the more people that are here,

177
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:35,609
it's almost like I got to, oh, I got to fucking, the show is going to be great. It has to be good.

178
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:38,970
I've got to, everything's going to be super funny. I have to, I got to try as hard as I can.

179
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,339
Everything's got, I got to try so hard. But then I try to run into the wall there and I go, don't

180
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:49,240
just fucking do what you've been doing normally, right? Um, it is, it is like kind of hard though.

181
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:57,740
I really don't want to have it kind of get in there and screw around with how I think and how

182
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:05,619
I do. And then it's not, I mean, it's not like the channel was unpopular before a year or two ago.

183
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:09,380
I, they would, there's, there's been a lot of people here for a long time. So I think I've

184
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:17,980
got, you're kind of used to it. So yeah, I'm, I think I'm doing okay. I hope so. And that,

185
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,180
I mean, that's up to you. That's up to you guys. I could sit here and go, you know, I think I'm

186
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:30,230
doing a pretty good job, but that's not for me to decide. Um, like I said, all I hope is,

187
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:37,829
I, you guys still think it's fun and funny and that's at the end of the day, that's it. Like,

188
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:47,339
cool. What are you talking about? Um, did you just open the stream and hear the word like,

189
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:58,940
uh, I know, don't be mean, don't be mean to anybody. You do get, and that's also like,

190
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:05,849
my schedule is kind of all over the place too. And, and like, I'll be honest with you,

191
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:09,289
me having a really erratic schedule where I stream maybe a couple of times a week, two,

192
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:17,319
three times a week, it kind of, it's hard to, let's just put it this way. It's hard to lock

193
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:24,569
in a lot of things with a lot of different potential companies and stuff. When I stream

194
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:32,549
kind of erratically, sporadically, like twice a week. So I'm just going to give 50 subs.

195
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:39,180
What the fuck? 50 subs from pixel cat. Thanks. I don't, and by the way, I don't shout out subs

196
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:50,140
or bits anymore, but I just did right there. Well, yeah. Um, if I can keep going, I'm going

197
00:29:50,140 --> 00:30:00,440
to keep going. And I think it's, it's, it's going well now, but could I like, could I broadcast

198
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,579
every single day and get on like the grind? But I was, I, I think a lot of people forget this.

199
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:15,259
I did that already. I did, I was on the grind already five years ago, six years ago, back in

200
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:22,250
the YouTube days, I was making a video every other day. Every two days, there'd be a new video,

201
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:27,880
even into kind of the lat, like a few years ago on Twitch. And then the whole medical shit caused

202
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:35,529
a bunch of problems, which it still does. That didn't go away. So yeah. Um, I, I already did all

203
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:38,890
that. I already, you know what? I'm going to be, I'm going to do this every single fucking day,

204
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:48,329
all day. Like I'm just going to do what I want to do now. What's the medical shit? Well, I don't

205
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:54,730
want to get this. I don't want it to be like the medical recap, but I have chest and back pain that

206
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:00,980
has never been solved. I've been to, I took like four months off in a row, uh, back a couple of

207
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,930
years ago to try to figure it out. And I was told it could be this, it could be this, it could be

208
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,579
this, it could be this, it could be this. And I ruled out a lot of really bad things. So that's

209
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:27,029
good. Uh, I'm, I'm doing fine though. Are you in a better chair? I am. Uh, yeah, it's good. You have

210
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:34,059
costochondritis. Okay. But you might not. Okay. There's a hernia that's in your, uh, in your

211
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:39,960
hiatal area. I don't, we don't think it's that though. Okay. You know, there's this little bone

212
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,720
right here that maybe it's called the xiphoid and it could be, do you think, oh, is that what's

213
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:55,430
causing it? Oh, I don't know. But no, I'm in, I'm in a new chair. This thing's great. This is the

214
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:01,700
Herman Miller. I know we make jokes about it, but seriously, that keeps me propped up. There's this

215
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,809
little wedge that's right here that just kind of is right there to make it so I can't slouch.

216
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:16,170
So it's great. It's good. What does it say? What do you say? What do you say? What do you say?

217
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,809
Yeah, just throw questions. I don't care. Whatever. Were you ever nervous streaming and how did you

218
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:28,970
get over it? Yes, I was incredibly. Um, the first, I'd say the first six months I started streaming,

219
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,789
I came from the YouTube world, which the YouTube world is you can mess up as many times as you

220
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:42,869
fucking want. You can mess up a hundred times in a row, a hundred times in a row, and you could

221
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:50,730
fix it. And it would be easy and nobody cares. And nobody knows on stream. You can't be in the

222
00:32:50,730 --> 00:33:00,579
middle of a sentence and go, um, three, one, two, three. Okay. So that doesn't work. Um, so it's,

223
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:08,619
it took a little bit of getting used to that because I, for five or six years,

224
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:15,829
I was used to the whole YouTube thing where I could just screw up a hundred times.

225
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:22,200
What was the last time I streamed high? Hmm. That's a good question. The last time I streamed high

226
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:33,099
was I think saw two. It was just, I, that was it. It's not today. No, I told you I,

227
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:40,869
people think I'm high every stream and no, man, I can't do it. I can't. People will say, no,

228
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:44,950
it was definitely the hitman stream when you were walking around in the cement place and freaking

229
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:55,829
out. No, it wasn't. I made that up. So I didn't look like a fucking idiot. All right. Here you go.

230
00:33:55,829 --> 00:34:03,099
Here you go. During the hitman stream where I was pissed off and talking so much shit about that

231
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:08,630
cement level. And everyone's like, dude, I remember reading in the chat, somebody was like, dude,

232
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:14,250
this guy, this is so stupid. This is hard to watch. There's no way he's not high. Otherwise

233
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,630
it's impossible. And I read that it was something I'm kind of paraphrasing it,

234
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:25,460
but I read that and I go, well, yeah, okay. I can, I can use that. And I think I actively said,

235
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,619
man, huh, this is what a bad time to be playing hitman right when the edible kicks in. And

236
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:36,659
everyone's like, Oh, yeah, of course. Of course. Of course. That's what happened. And everyone's

237
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:53,670
like, see, Oh, yeah, of course. I was stone stone cold sober that whole stream. Do you have any

238
00:34:53,670 --> 00:35:02,440
kids? No. But now I've used that. I've done that too many times that people really do think I'm

239
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:14,139
high every single stream, which is bad because it's not true. What's my favorite soda flavor?

240
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:27,099
I think just, just straight up just standard Coca-Cola or a vanilla Coke or I've, you know,

241
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:37,500
I've really liked those San San Pellegrino San that right San Pellegrino. They have this blood

242
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:50,940
orange San Pellegrino and it's great. How long were you getting zero views on your videos until

243
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,460
you started getting more views? I actually, I don't, it's been so long. I really don't remember.

244
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:04,360
I just, I really don't. I remember TF2 had the big, I would try to get searched for because TF2

245
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:10,059
at the time was uploading, not uploading, but they were adding tons of new stuff to TF2.

246
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:15,110
And everyone was sort of looking for footage of that stuff. So when anytime, for instance,

247
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:20,940
oh, the medic got a new syringe gun that afternoon, the second that that update dropped,

248
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:28,070
the second that steam was downloading it. Boom. Okay. Let's go record, get footage of it,

249
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:34,219
talk about it, understand what it, what it, what it does and get it up as fast as I could.

250
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:37,670
While still having to be a video that I thought was like good because there were a lot of times

251
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,969
where I didn't do that. And I just kept fucking up the video over and over again. And I just

252
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:47,800
watched it back. And I was like, this video sucks. I'll just wait till tomorrow. And I would be,

253
00:36:47,800 --> 00:37:00,539
I would get it out like a day or two later. Somebody said, have you ever read Animal Farm?

254
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:21,449
Wait, like the book Animal Farm? I've seen the cover a bunch of times. No. Have you ever read

255
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:29,289
Ender's Game? No, I don't read. I don't, I actually don't read it. I really don't. It's bad, but I

256
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:41,190
don't. Most of my reading is the back of cereal boxes to see how much iron is in it. Or it's to

257
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:52,710
read an ingredients list to see, does that have high fructose corn syrup in it? The heck. I've

258
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:58,019
read, oh, you know what turned me off reading forever? I read the Game of Thrones books and

259
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:03,320
I was super into them. And those are like 5 million pages each. And I was obsessed with them. And

260
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,000
then they just never came out ever again. So I was like, I fucking hate books. I'm never reading a

261
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:30,300
book again. What's my personal squat record, bro? I didn't do squats. I love that. That's, this is

262
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:41,690
like, this is such a, that's like, that's like the piano of, of the comb sounds, right? Do you guys

263
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:50,380
think that, um, the last Game of Thrones books will ever come out? I, I, I don't think they will.

264
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:58,280
I really don't. I've accepted at this point that I just don't. I'll, I'm okay. At this point in my

265
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:06,119
mind, after, at, at, in the middle of the last chapter of Dance of Dragons, in my brain, there

266
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:12,840
was this elaborate shit going on. Crazy story. Oh, Tyrion Lannister and, oh my God, Daenerys.

267
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:19,420
All this crazy cool stuff. And in my mind, what I do is I, I go to the middle of the last page of

268
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:26,679
that book and I pretend that a meteor hit earth in the middle of one of their sentences in the

269
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:33,909
last page. And that's it. And it's like, obviously they can't do any more of this story. A fucking

270
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:43,239
meteor hit earth and wiped out all of civilization. That's how I do it. As you had just a comet

271
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:52,809
strikes earth and kills everybody. So, wow. I, wow. What if, right? What if, I wonder what would

272
00:39:52,809 --> 00:40:03,780
happen if that comet didn't strike earth? That's probably a real, that's probably the real ending.

273
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:11,400
That'd be funny. That would be so funny. At this point, I feel like he should do that. You know

274
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:23,059
what I mean? Does that the end of Winds of Winter or whatever? Does it have a meteor strike? The

275
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:32,090
book is, the book is like 60 pages long. I feel like people would forgive him for that. I feel

276
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:47,820
like it'd be like, that's actually really funny. That's such a horse shit. Yeah. And you know how

277
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,820
it's broken up by chapters by name. So for instance, if you don't, if you had never read

278
00:40:51,820 --> 00:41:00,099
the song of ice and fire books, it's their chapters are broken up into the Tyrion one and then

279
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:05,860
Tyrion two comes three or four chapters later, right? Tyrion six. So the chapters are the names

280
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,780
of the characters and then like what chapter that character is on. So how fucking funny would it be

281
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:16,280
if you just turn the page and it was like meteor one and it was what the meteor was up to during

282
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:22,949
the, during a feast for crows and you've got meteor two, meteor three, meteor four, and meteor

283
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:28,789
four is when it hits. I mean, I don't have to give you all the answers, George, but

284
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:41,349
could be one of them. What's the shirt? It's hash house a go-go at the link. Best cheeseburger

285
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:58,860
I've ever had in my life. How do you feel? I feel all right. Are you going to Twitch con?

286
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:07,909
Probably not. Probably not. Way too much going on around that time period. That probably not.

287
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:19,800
We'll see though. I don't know. I don't think so. What Diablo two clash should I choose? Are you

288
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,780
kind of, are you a kind of person that likes to, you know, do spells or do you like spells and

289
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,610
summoning or do you like summoning? If you like to summon, I'm telling you the most fun you could

290
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:34,570
ever have in any game. No one's ever done it as good. No one's ever done it as good. Summoning in

291
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:41,300
all games sucks ass in every single game except for this one. I don't know what, okay, let me go

292
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:48,170
off on a little bit of a tangent here. What happened to summoning in video games? Because

293
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:52,780
summoning in video games became this, it was this cool thing that you could just summon a shit load

294
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,619
of things and have like a ton of different kinds of units and almost be like this commander to,

295
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:04,659
you get two and they're kind of strong, aren't they? I don't want two summons. I don't want to

296
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:10,260
like dump a bunch of points into one summon or like three summons. I want 30 things on the screen.

297
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:19,320
Oh man, I'm going to be, oh, there's a summoner in this. Oh shit. I wonder what it's like.

298
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:34,550
You get two skeletons or two specters. Isn't that fun? That's StarCraft, idiot. You're an idiot.

299
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:39,559
I don't like that game. I didn't like StarCraft. You know why? Because I played it when I was like

300
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:45,320
fucking 15 over like a telephone connection with somebody. And they did this thing where I went,

301
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,000
I was about to beat them. I was about to defeat them, right? I'm going to defeat them. And they

302
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,960
played this, whatever this character class was, wherever it was, where their building started to

303
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,909
float off the ground and I couldn't attack them. And I just couldn't do anything. He lowers all

304
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:03,909
the buildings and then he attacked me afterwards and I lost the game. So I was like, this game's

305
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:20,519
stupid. I'm never playing it ever again. Terran. Yeah, whatever. That was stupid. You got out Terran.

306
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:27,239
I was 14 and I, what do you want me to say? Out Terran. I don't have like 10,000 hours in StarCraft.

307
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:32,650
I was playing with my friends over a telephone line and I was like, this game's dumb.

308
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:43,219
I don't want to play it anymore. You said 15. I don't know. It was when I was younger. Wait,

309
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:46,489
talk. Wait, wait, what do you want to do? Can you look off screen when you talk? I don't want to

310
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:55,139
make eye contact with you. All right. I'm not, I'm talking, I'm talking like this. I'm talking like

311
00:44:55,139 --> 00:45:00,920
this. I'm not looking at you. You ever played RuneScape? I never played RuneScape, but I really

312
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,590
feel like I should have. I feel like I would be a super RuneScape guy if I ever played it back in

313
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:22,280
the day. I don't think I could play it now. Can you say big Chungus? I just did. Oh shit. Am I even

314
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:29,739
on Twitch right now? Oh boy. Wait, what did I think I was streaming this to? Dude, am I even

315
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:55,800
on Twitch right now? No, you're not. Twitter spaces. Do I have any good other tweet, draft

316
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:04,300
tweets? Let's find out. Let me see if I have any, any, any good draft tweets. Okay. So,

317
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,519
all right. This is a pretty good one. So by the way, you guys, here's something you guys need to

318
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:19,659
know. Some of you new viewers potentially. I don't use Twitter, but I write a tweet and I put it into

319
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:24,059
drafts because I just don't want to post it. So I have like 30, I have like 50 draft tweets.

320
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:33,030
I'll read this one. I legit thought every show was filmed in front of a room full of overly

321
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:38,780
excited people until I was like 20. Knowing the truth was a Santa Claus 2 situation.

322
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,969
All right. I got to, I got to tell you this. This was from the 4th of July.

323
00:46:54,630 --> 00:47:01,909
I was fucking, okay. This tweet is a bat just tried to fucking attack me,

324
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:07,500
is the tweet. I just didn't tweet it. I use Twitter drafts as like a journal.

325
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:12,699
Okay. So me and Holly, we're walking around. So I just like, Oh, let's go take a walk.

326
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:18,219
4th of July, whatever. Let's go take a walk. We just, Oh, well, it's like, Oh, cool. Like people

327
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:23,559
are out. Oh, this is interesting. Just taking a walk. We're on the way back, walking around

328
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:31,639
and going down around as we're through like the neighborhoods and everything. And we get close to,

329
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:39,849
we get close to the place, like my place. And maybe I would say a couple hundred yards away

330
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:50,570
from the house, like from my house. And I just saw from right here, it was just this like,

331
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:54,139
just floating right here. And I thought it was like a bug or something. So I didn't freak out.

332
00:47:54,139 --> 00:48:00,300
And there were two other people walking and they noticed that I stopped and they noticed that I was

333
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,420
being weird because I was just like, what, what is, what's going on? Holly's right here next to me.

334
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:12,219
And she goes, she kind of screams and she dodges. And this fucking bat, dude, this huge bat, we're

335
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:19,829
talking like Batman type in the fucking silhouette with the light behind it. Huge bat was just like

336
00:48:20,389 --> 00:48:24,630
flapping its wings, like trying to fucking kill me. It was like, it was about to kill me. It was

337
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:30,679
about to like start attacking me. And I was like, I freaked out. I screamed and I moved around. And

338
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:36,150
the people over there thought I was afraid of their dog. They were kind of walking with their dogs

339
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:41,880
and they thought I was like screaming at the dogs. And I'm like, no, no, did you see the bat?

340
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,860
I said, did you guys see the bat that flew over? And they're like, no, we didn't. Wow, a bat. And

341
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:51,900
I'm like, yeah, a bat. And I had Holly right there too. So I wasn't, I wasn't crazy. So,

342
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,619
because she was also freaking out too, but they thought, I think they originally thought I was

343
00:48:54,619 --> 00:49:03,699
scared of the dogs that they had, but it was like, it was, it was crazy. And there are bats around,

344
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:06,820
right? And you see them from time to time. You look up and you see them kind of swoop around,

345
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:16,820
but never that close. What breed? I don't know what breed the dog was. It was just a nondescript

346
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:23,909
dog on a leash. I don't, I didn't, I don't know what breed the dog was. It was just a dog. It was

347
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:32,329
two, it was two dogs. They were just dogs. I, it was dark. It was 4th of July. What breed was the

348
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:39,980
bat? I don't know. It was big. This is a lie. This is not a lie. I'm, this happened to me

349
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:45,260
on the 4th of July. And it's not even that crazy of a story. A bat flew into my face.

350
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:50,219
And me and Holly were like, kind of laughing our asses off about it. Cause it's just like,

351
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:56,789
can you imagine if I had to cancel a stream? Like the reasoning. Oh, hey, sorry guys. I got

352
00:49:56,789 --> 00:50:03,590
to cancel the stream. I got attacked by a bat. I got bit by a bat. I have to, I can't stream

353
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:13,769
tomorrow. What are your thoughts on the tectonic plates? I mean, I think we should stop fucking

354
00:50:13,769 --> 00:50:28,460
with them. Vampire Andy. Jerma, I've spent so many points. I need an answer. Oh, it just got

355
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:41,480
deleted. It's gone. I don't know what it was. It was something about, have you ever eaten a bag of

356
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,840
warheads in one sitting? And the answer is no, because that's fucked up. Don't do that. That's

357
00:50:44,840 --> 00:51:03,909
weird. I can't stream. There's a bee here. Are you going to release new shirts? You too, shirt Andy.

358
00:51:03,909 --> 00:51:11,820
Yeah. All right. Well, I, but it's a surprise if it goes through. Yes. This things, this merchandise

359
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:16,460
that I've like, oh, that would be kind of fun. There's a lot of merchandise coming, a lot of

360
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:23,420
merchandise wearables, but it's cool. And I want to announce it when I, when I want to announce it

361
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:28,309
and it's going to be cool. You could probably guess what it is. If you could just, if you wanted to

362
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:37,719
guess of what merchandise could be coming in the next 30 to 45 days, what is happening in the next

363
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:42,440
30 to 45 days on this channel? What could possibly be tied in with that? What could you possibly tie

364
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:50,659
in with that? You know what I mean, Vern? I can't fucking hide and drink. I hate drinking on camera.

365
00:51:50,659 --> 00:52:06,420
I always feel like nobody looks good drinking on camera. Nobody. Is it a bat shirt? It's just like

366
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:19,800
a big flapping bat. But that story is not even that big. It's not even like a crazy story.

367
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:33,960
I just forgot about it because I had a tweet that I didn't tweet. Why do you have the 2016

368
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:41,539
before Vegas camera? Make the, that one's gotten too. Mods are on point today. Mods are on point

369
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:56,389
today. Do you like hamsters or guinea pigs? Are they both cute and fun and interesting and fun?

370
00:52:56,389 --> 00:53:02,469
I don't know. They're both, both of them are fine. I haven't combed in a while. You're right. Let's

371
00:53:02,469 --> 00:53:19,929
fix that right now. This is too long. This is, this is like a little too long. I'll grow into it.

372
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:27,619
I'll grow into it. It's just a little too long. Once these come out a little and this comes down

373
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:50,550
a little, it'll look a lot better. Who's your favorite chat member? All of you. Nope. That's

374
00:53:50,550 --> 00:54:06,119
a joke. Some of you guys are dicks. Would you ever be an actor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?

375
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:21,099
I don't know. At this point, who would I even be? They've, they've like made every movie.

376
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:40,420
Well, who would I even be? The Joker. That's a different universe. You should be in a movie.

377
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:52,570
We make our own movies here. You still was, I didn't say it.

378
00:54:54,199 --> 00:55:01,320
Oh, you could be young Green Goblin. I could be old. I could be regular Green Goblin. I'm 36.

379
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:08,539
I might look, you know what I mean? I think a lot. I might look a little younger, but I'm 40 in,

380
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:18,659
I've got to be regular. Why don't I be young Green Goblin? Young Green Goblin. How old was

381
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:35,860
Willem Dafoe in this first Spider-Man movie? 40 something. You don't look old. I don't want to,

382
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:45,909
I don't want to be young Green Goblin. Moisturized Green Goblin. He was 45. Okay.

383
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:58,329
So in 10 years, we'll talk. How come you look like so many different celebrities? I don't know.

384
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:09,500
I'm, what do you want me to say? I have brown hair. I have a, I'm default face Andy. I mean,

385
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:21,690
I'm just brown hair white guy. I mean, there's, what do you want me to say? I default face.

386
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:39,610
Give us a profile. Okay. My profiles are a little different because my nose is crooked.

387
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:45,320
So like, for instance, like this, ready? This is a little, and my hair is parted this way too.

388
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:52,019
So my nose goes this way. So my nose is more pronounced over here with my nostril because

389
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:56,980
my nose is crooked and my mouth is like upside down. I don't know. A lot of people don't,

390
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:05,269
don't know that about me, but take a look at my mouth. Half of my mouth is like normal. And then

391
00:57:05,269 --> 00:57:13,820
the other half is like Joker mouth. Like I have like half Joker mouth. See what I mean? Like it

392
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,760
goes like kind of down and this way, but here it's, it's kind of flat. So I have like my lip

393
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:24,420
kind of goes down like that and my nose goes this way. So that's why I look a little different from

394
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,820
this angle because I've got kind of like the Joker mouth here and the nose going this way.

395
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:34,710
Whereas over here, it's a little less pronounced on the Joker mouth and the nose is going that

396
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:38,789
way. So my, and the eye is a little set a little differently because this one's set a little deeper

397
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:50,090
from head on. I mean, it's fine, but once you get an angle here, you kind of see the different

398
00:57:51,019 --> 00:58:07,960
roads. My face has kind of like two-face guy kind of. Yeah. Cause my lip line goes like this

399
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:16,460
instead of like on this side, it goes like this. It's just like the way my lip goes.

400
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:36,360
And then this line goes a little bit further like that. So if I go like this, ready, I'm sure I,

401
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:49,130
whatever, I'm trying to move the nose and get rid of the lip line. You'd, you'd be a good rat man

402
00:58:49,130 --> 00:59:01,079
instead of a Batman. I don't, I would want to, I would not want to be Batman. Have you seen the

403
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:12,940
new Minion movie? By the way, I have a question about the new Minion movie. Why do they keep

404
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:24,039
putting Gru in these movies? Minions, rise of Gru. Minions, Gru's in it as well. No, the kids

405
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:32,150
don't give a shit about Gru. Why do they have to keep tying it to Gru? The Minions is what

406
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:38,440
everybody cares about. Why not just, why does he have to be in the movie? Why can't it be like

407
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:45,900
the Minions? Uh, like the Minion, the great Minion caper, right? The great Muppet caper,

408
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:51,800
like they can't just have their own movie. He's the main character, not in the Minion movies.

409
00:59:51,800 --> 01:00:04,280
This is the Minions movie. Minions. They already did that. There's a way there's already a Minions

410
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:19,000
movie with just the Minions movie. What was it? What did they do? Minions, the rise of Gru,

411
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,570
Minions film. Okay. Minions is a 2015 American computer animated comedy film produced by

412
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:35,820
illumination. Oh, there is a, this is a long time ago. The rise of Gru is Minions too. So wait,

413
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:40,539
did the Minions, they could, they couldn't hang on their own? So they needed Gru to come back

414
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:57,380
him up? What did people think about the first one? It sucked. Did it really? Oh shit, it has bad,

415
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:12,889
it doesn't have great reviews. No, you're right. Imagine not being invested in Minions lore. Hold

416
01:01:12,889 --> 01:01:22,489
on. What, what did it actually have for ratings? Minions movie, like Rotten Tomatoes. I want to,

417
01:01:22,489 --> 01:01:36,090
ooh, this is really, what was wrong with it? Okay. Let's, let's read it. Okay. I got tired

418
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:40,250
of this joke before the movie ended, but I appreciate the gusto with which the filmmakers,

419
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:50,380
particularly Coffin with his nimble vocalizations carried it out. Okay. Fittingly, because they're

420
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:57,179
pill shaped, the Minions work best in small doses. That's a line. That's why, that's why,

421
01:01:57,179 --> 01:02:10,219
that's why they're a top critic. Top critic. What a fucking line. Seeing the Minions end up in your

422
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:17,800
happy meal would not have been a stretch in this absurd, tangential movie. Actually, it would have

423
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:26,409
been more to the point. Holy shit. These critics have some real bangers. This, these are fucking

424
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:48,409
great. Okay. Okay. Let's start with what Minions gets right. It's a mercifully short 93 minutes

425
01:02:48,409 --> 01:02:59,420
long, but even at that length, it still feels padded. Merciful. It's, I just imagine this guy

426
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:11,780
sitting there just like fucking fidgeting in the chair, like, ah, it's like, you know, the last

427
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:17,159
40 minutes on an airplane when it's like a four or five hour airplane and you've made it all the

428
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:20,519
way through, but you only got like another 30 minutes left and you're just like, fucking get

429
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:31,400
me the fuck out of this chair. And then you hear like, we are now doing our final descent in Las

430
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:38,280
Vegas, whatever. And you're just like, thank God. But that last 30 minutes takes four hours. That's

431
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:52,699
how this guy felt watching the Minion movie. Calm down, dude. It's just a cartoon. Like right before,

432
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:56,699
okay, on an airplane, right before it's like time to, you got to sit down for the, you have to,

433
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:02,980
you have to be seated for that 40 straight minutes to an hour during the descent, right? So I know

434
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,980
that's coming. So she's like, all right, but right before we do the final descent, I try to time it

435
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,420
so I can just like get up, go to the bathroom, even if I don't have to piss or anything,

436
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:22,889
and just like, just like fucking get me out of here. And just like look in the mirror and like

437
01:04:22,889 --> 01:04:29,690
wash my hands. Okay, fine. Okay, I'm good. And then sit down. And I'm ready for the hour that you

438
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:38,469
can't move. No, I'm not talking, I'm not, I'm just talking about, I'm not like going into the fucking,

439
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:43,989
the bathroom in the airplane and like making a bunch of weird sounds and stuff. I'm just saying

440
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:49,019
like you move around, you kind of crack your knuckles. I can't, I hate sitting there for an

441
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:54,889
hour. I would never ever, and this is why people are like, oh, hey man, you ever gonna go to like

442
01:04:54,889 --> 01:05:01,210
Europe for anything? No, I could never do it. I can never do people, oh yeah, man, it's not bad.

443
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:16,010
Yeah, the flight to London's not bad. It's like 11 hours. Huh? No, no, no, no. I keep, I hear about

444
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:22,409
people that take these long trips across the whole world. Well, yeah, it's 12 hours. And then you get

445
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:29,449
off at, you know, whatever in, in like France. And then after an hour, you lay over for an hour,

446
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:36,940
you get another 14 hour plane. I think, no, I'll do, can I do it through Zoom? Just sleep,

447
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:45,960
I can't sleep on airplanes. It's, it's, I just can't do it. I've tried, I just can't do it.

448
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,239
One of the number one reasons I cannot sleep on an airplane is nothing to do with like being

449
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:54,949
able to actually, you know, drift off and go to bed. It's, I don't know what I look like sleeping

450
01:05:54,949 --> 01:06:02,519
on an airplane. It freaks me out. Cause I, cause people walk up and down that aisle and I just know

451
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:09,099
that, you know, if I'm sitting there like, it's just like people are walking by going like, oh,

452
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:14,539
that guy's sleeping. Like, no, don't, I don't want, I don't want to, like, I always have a hat.

453
01:06:14,539 --> 01:06:20,500
So I go like, put the hat down like this, but then you're like, and then it's like, okay,

454
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:35,460
put a mask on. You're such a diva. You know, I remember one time you want to diva moment.

455
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:40,710
I remember one time, you know, this movie's on airplanes. It's like, okay, it's going to be,

456
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:47,940
so for instance, I'll give you a perfect example. Bohemian Rhapsody, the movie. It's like, oh, hey,

457
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:53,219
by the way, there's movies on your TV in front of you. Right. So, and everyone goes, oh, okay.

458
01:06:53,219 --> 01:06:56,900
Am I going to watch the movie or what is on long planes, by the way, at least like three, four or

459
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:02,820
five hours. So there was, there was one time when I was taking a plane and I loaded up Bohemian

460
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:08,150
Rhapsody. I was like, all right, Bohemian Rhapsody, let's go. I want to watch Bohemian Rhapsody.

461
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:16,059
And I, maybe I didn't start it fast enough, but there was a guy over there who also was watching

462
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:23,190
Bohemian Rhapsody and I was in the aisle and he was in the aisle. And out of the corner of my eye,

463
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:32,389
he was 10 seconds in front of me in the movie. And I'm just sitting there being like,

464
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:42,150
shit, I could see this. There's a stream delay. I'm getting the stream delay version. So I just

465
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:47,659
sat there and I was like, I can't watch this movie because I'm literally, I literally am seeing this.

466
01:07:47,659 --> 01:07:51,579
I have this in like my peripheral, like right there. Somebody else is watching the exact same

467
01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:55,579
fucking movie 10 seconds in front of me. So I contemplate, I didn't do this, but I contemplated,

468
01:07:55,579 --> 01:08:05,429
I contemplated walking up to him and saying, Steve from Davidson high school. So he had

469
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:10,969
to pause his movie. And so he'd be like, oh no, I'd be like, oh shit, sorry about that.

470
01:08:10,969 --> 01:08:15,880
So they're like, all right, I'll get back to my seat so I can watch the fucking movie now.

471
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:24,470
I didn't do it. I just didn't watch. But you know what I mean? Like the thought for one second was

472
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:31,189
like, I was going to wait for him to go to the bathroom. Like, okay, when he go, I can like,

473
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:41,079
can I catch, is he going to pause the movie? Fast forward. You can't fast forward. You're such a

474
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:45,319
bad liar. This is a real story. Like I'm not, why would I, what a dumb thing to make up. This is a

475
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:51,539
stupid thing to make up. This is a dumb thing to make up. I didn't do it. I didn't do that. I

476
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:56,979
thought about it. Like, is there like, how do I like, because I'm not, I can't get over that.

477
01:08:56,979 --> 01:09:10,069
It's right there. ADHD makes you a genius in the wrong ways, but you would have to have paused your

478
01:09:10,069 --> 01:09:18,229
movie as well. So that's why I said, all right, fuck it. I can't, I'm not going to watch this

479
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:20,949
movie and I'm not going to bother somebody because that's like, I don't want to do that.

480
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:24,310
That's stupid. I wouldn't want somebody to bother me. Like you're just trying to relax on a plane.

481
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:28,470
Like I'm not going to do that. So I just like, try to go to bed and whatever. But now if I want

482
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:34,949
to watch a movie, if I ever want to watch a fucking movie ever, it's like, oh, and the movies are on,

483
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:39,270
what is it? Stuart Little, Stuart Little, go, go, go, Stuart Little. I'm watching Stuart Little

484
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:44,569
first. Fuck off. I got it first. I'm watching Stuart Little. So, and then I just go and turn

485
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:55,909
it on as soon as it's possible. So then imagine like, so I get Stuart Little on, right? Stuart

486
01:09:55,909 --> 01:10:00,569
Little is on. I got somebody right next to me, right? And playing and whatever. And I'm five to

487
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:12,380
ten minutes into Stuart Little and I feel, hey, yeah. Oh, I paused the movie. John? John from,

488
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:23,989
from, from Davidson Academy? I know this trick motherfucker. And I'm just going to hit play.

489
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:38,899
Oh, play. No, sorry. Enjoy the movie. Nice standup routine. This is a comb stream.

490
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:45,960
All the new viewers don't understand what this is. It's for me to give you all my failed material.

491
01:10:46,600 --> 01:11:01,050
Who is your favorite minion? Definitely the one that wears overalls. You know what they should do?

492
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:09,210
Then they used to do this, didn't they? They used to do this. Wasn't it? The movies just started.

493
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:24,729
And if you, they just played at the same time for everybody, right? It used to be like that.

494
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:31,779
They all did. Yeah. All of them started at the same time. They would even announce it. They'd go,

495
01:11:31,779 --> 01:11:36,899
by the way, if you want to watch Stuart Little, it's currently on channel four, whatever. And it's

496
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:40,739
currently about to start. And it's like, okay, I'm going to, there's Stuart Little right there.

497
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:53,960
You're a minion centrist. Don't stop talking about Stuart Little.

498
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:09,369
Well, you don't like that movie. You didn't like Stuart Little. No, you didn't. Dr. House

499
01:12:09,369 --> 01:12:15,930
is in that movie and he's great in it. By the way, Dr. House is a great show if you haven't seen it.

500
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:29,640
Um, what's wrong with you? Who would win in a fight? Ratatouille or Stuart Little? Stuart Little

501
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:42,390
would run him over with the car. Do Toontown now. Would you survive the zombie apocalypse?

502
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:45,829
Anybody that says with complete and total certainty that they would survive the zombie

503
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:57,640
apocalypse would not survive the zombie apocalypse. I'd be scrappy. I don't know

504
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:03,319
if I would do it though. I would try. Where would you go in a zombie apocalypse? I mean,

505
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:15,579
the easiest answer is the grocery store, right? But that's what everyone's going to do.

506
01:13:15,579 --> 01:13:20,970
Oh, I know what I would do. I would go to the newest showing of the minions movie because no

507
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:34,869
one was going to be there. Ow. I'm just kidding guys. I don't know. I'm too old to care about the

508
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:42,170
minions. Once the minions replaced Shrek at Universal Studios, that's how I knew I was too

509
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:49,819
old. That's how I knew I was too old for anything. I don't even know if that's accurate. I just said

510
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:58,970
it. No, you know how I know I'm too old for anything? When I found out that because at

511
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:05,449
Universal Studios, it was at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios Florida, right? When I found

512
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:13,350
out that there was no more Nickelodeon Studios anymore, that all there is at Universal Studios

513
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:21,289
that's Nickelodeon related is a store with SpongeBob on it. I'm just like, what happened?

514
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:36,920
What happened? There's a merchandise booth for Nickelodeon. There's no, where are the rides?

515
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:44,250
Where's Nickelodeon Studios? Nickelodeon fell off. Yeah, but still, I mean,

516
01:14:47,079 --> 01:14:51,020
you know, SpongeBob is, everyone still loves SpongeBob. Don't kids still love SpongeBob?

517
01:14:51,020 --> 01:15:14,220
They still do, right? Yeah. Why am I encouraging it? I don't know. Have you ever done psychedelics

518
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:26,710
before? No. No, I don't. I never want to. I'm not into that at all. I'm really not. Why not?

519
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:34,810
I mean, there's a few reasons why. I think like alcohol and marijuana, they affect you in a way

520
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:43,930
that you still kind of have like control and an agency, right? I'm not into the kind of loss

521
01:15:43,930 --> 01:16:02,060
of agency, the loss of kind of control. I don't like that. So no, I would never do it. I know that

522
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:07,909
like I've heard that you can, there's lower doses, right? But I don't think so. I'm not into it at

523
01:16:07,909 --> 01:16:29,939
all. Not at all. He's a control freak. Yeah, I don't, I, no, I can't. But yeah, I mean,

524
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:37,100
I also don't want to encourage people to do something like that because I honestly,

525
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:42,539
I have no experience with it. So I would never ever want to tell anybody on this stream. Oh man.

526
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:49,449
Yeah, dude, go for it. No, right? Like that's, that's not something I'm ever going to ever talk

527
01:16:49,449 --> 01:16:58,899
about because I don't do it and I don't ever want to do it. So that's the way it is. What do I think

528
01:16:58,899 --> 01:17:09,479
of Ludwig's recent show? I thought it was unbelievable. Is it true that you drink a shot of vodka before

529
01:17:09,479 --> 01:17:12,760
big streams? Ludwig leaked it today on his stream because he did it before Mogul Money and called

530
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:23,909
it the German method. Yeah, usually. Yeah. What it does is it, everybody kind of gets together and we

531
01:17:23,909 --> 01:17:36,090
do a big toast and it's a good way to kind of, you get everybody together. New lore. I mean,

532
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:46,649
people aren't fucking throwing back like booze the whole time. It's a toast. It's a toast. It's not a

533
01:17:46,649 --> 01:17:52,579
everybody catch together, let's get fucked up. It's, it's a toast. And it's a way to get everybody

534
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:58,060
together and say, let's have a good show. And usually whether it's me or Jake or whatever,

535
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:04,500
we thank everybody for being there, especially the crew. And I don't know, I feel like it's a

536
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:09,579
nice fun way to make a, and it's never required or anything, right? It's one of those things where

537
01:18:09,579 --> 01:18:14,970
you can do it if you want to, if you're obviously old enough, right? And if not, then that's all

538
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:22,390
good. But I like doing stuff like that because to the person like behind the camera, to the person

539
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:27,750
like at the audio deck, to the person like in front of the camera, doing a toast, that's like a

540
01:18:27,989 --> 01:18:33,210
let's get it. Let's do it. Let's go for it is a really nice fun way to do it. Toast to health

541
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:38,039
and wealth. Yeah. Oh yeah. Usually Jake will say a few words. I'll say a few words and we just like,

542
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:46,600
let's go for it. Mogul Money Live was unbelievable. Ludwig should be incredibly fucking proud of

543
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:54,979
himself and everybody that was on that show is a great show. I said this before. I said this before

544
01:18:54,979 --> 01:19:04,649
Ludwig has it. If you're looking for it, you look carbonated, turn the full cam off. I'm trying to

545
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:13,300
be real. No, it was, it was a really, it was a really awesome thing to watch. I laughed out loud

546
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:32,140
at least a dozen times. This is Jeremy today, not Jerma. Kind of the same, but not really,

547
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:40,810
maybe a little different. You look carbonated. Is that your bed on the floor behind you? That's

548
01:19:40,810 --> 01:20:03,100
the bed that Otto doesn't sleep in. Are you green screened in? No, I'm not. But yeah. No, I,

549
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:12,569
let's talk about shows too. I love that shit more than anything. Doing the big stuff is just,

550
01:20:12,569 --> 01:20:16,409
I love every second of it. I love being there. I love talking to everybody there. I love,

551
01:20:16,489 --> 01:20:23,340
I love getting in it, into it big time, right? That's what the focus is. That's what the focus

552
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:32,569
is for the foreseeable future. If I can, you look like a cardboard cutout. What would, what would

553
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:45,750
my cardboard cutout even look like? They all look kind of odd and uncanny, right? And their hands

554
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:52,619
are always way too small. It's like this, right? It's always like their arms and there's a weird

555
01:20:52,619 --> 01:21:06,819
perspective problem. So this is 2D plane and it's like this. Do a cigar tier list. I don't smoke

556
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:20,939
cigars. The dollhouse was incredible, but that's the thing. I've, I've, I told you guys about the

557
01:21:20,939 --> 01:21:25,210
stress of doing stuff behind the scenes with this baseball show, and I won't go into that much

558
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:36,500
detail, but trying to do these things is very hard sometimes. And it's like just, it, it annoys me

559
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:45,270
that it is, right? And I'm at the point right now where I'm doing everything possible to make sure

560
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:52,630
that I can do some of these big things that I want to do. And how do you do that? Do you

561
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:58,970
get sponsors? Do you have like maybe one of the platforms will, will do it, right? Or,

562
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:10,180
reach out or whatever, but nothing's ever guaranteed. And I'm starting to realize that

563
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:17,479
fact right now that it's not just like, oh yeah, dollhouse was really cool. Let's do another one.

564
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,920
Oh yeah, let's do another one right now. Let's go right now. Let's go for it. Well, how much is

565
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:31,210
it going to cost? A lot, a lot. Okay. Does anybody want to pay for it? Maybe even if we reach out,

566
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:38,739
whatever. And we've, for baseball, there are sponsors we've been talking to, but it's actually

567
01:22:38,739 --> 01:22:45,640
kind of a lot harder than I anticipated. It's been too long since the last co-op stream. Yeah,

568
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:53,460
it has. It has. Don't do it then. Just play shitty 2000s video games. I would quit if that's what I

569
01:22:53,460 --> 01:23:03,829
was just doing every day. I have to be, I'm going to be honest with you. I have to. It's these big

570
01:23:03,829 --> 01:23:13,529
shows that keep me around. I have to be real. And I always said this, I never want to force myself

571
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:17,130
to do something or I never want to do something just to do it. Which is another reason why you've

572
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:27,819
seen, I mean, stream two or three times a week, maybe less than that. Cause I can't do that. It's

573
01:23:27,819 --> 01:23:33,210
unfair to me. It's unfair to you and anybody else that had anything to do with any of the projects

574
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:44,409
or anything. What's the worst comb you've ever had? A comb is just teeth spread out very finely.

575
01:23:44,409 --> 01:23:58,260
It's not, this is, this is, this is, this is, this is all there is. Now that was a cardboard cutout

576
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:24,229
here. This lice in your hair. Now what? Now what? Uh, what were we saying? If you had a hundred

577
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:33,399
thousand dollars, what would you use it for? The baseball show. There it is. Or other stuff too.

578
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:39,020
There's so many things I want to do. I have, I just, this, I, what, what am I even going to

579
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:45,609
say about it? But just know that I've been desperately trying to do shit behind the scenes

580
01:24:45,609 --> 01:24:50,090
and trying to make sure I can cover it, make sure I can do it, make sure I can pay for it.

581
01:24:50,090 --> 01:25:05,500
He's desperately trying to shit. You should host a fundraising night. That's a pre mini event that

582
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:11,670
I don't want you guys to pay for that. That's the whole point. I don't want people to mention,

583
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:15,579
maybe you're dude getting the crowdfunding and stuff. No, I don't want to do that.

584
01:25:15,579 --> 01:25:20,859
I don't want to do that because I don't want you guys to pay for it. This channel over the

585
01:25:20,859 --> 01:25:28,250
last 10 plus years, I have not done very many sponsors and you guys have, I've had so much

586
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:33,380
money has come into this channel already that I really don't want to fucking do that. I don't

587
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:40,869
want to be one of those people that's like, Oh yeah, I mean fucking thousands of subs a month.

588
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:45,510
Hey, uh, yo, um, people that have already, you know, been paying me a shitload of money every

589
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:49,670
month. Hey dude, I want to do this project. I need like fucking 200 K let's make it happen.

590
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:56,310
Community let's go. No, fuck that. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that.

591
01:25:56,310 --> 01:26:06,439
I really don't want to do that. Um, because I already, there's already subs on the channel,

592
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:12,140
right? I don't, it's, that doesn't, I don't like it. I don't want to do it.

593
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:19,939
I would rather have a company come in, be able to cover the whole thing and that's it. And let's go

594
01:26:19,939 --> 01:26:27,020
and a lot of the, look, the companies that come in and help, obviously my brain goes, all right,

595
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:30,140
what do I want to do? What do I want to show? What can I showcase? What, what, what, what

596
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:36,899
sponsors do I want? And a lot of times I have to kind of think about, okay, does the show being

597
01:26:36,899 --> 01:26:45,180
paid for? And that looks good. We have the money. Okay. Who is the sponsor? Who is it? And trying

598
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:54,840
to find the right sponsor and the right time. And it, it's, it's, it's a lot harder than I thought,

599
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:05,909
but no, I don't want my viewers to pay for these two, $300,000 plus projects that the whole point

600
01:27:05,909 --> 01:27:20,199
was I didn't want to have to write the checks myself. So I wouldn't go broke, right? Cause of

601
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:25,340
course I, I'm, I can't, what, am I going to sit here and pretend that I don't make a lot of money

602
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:35,539
doing this? I would be full of shit. I'd be full of shit. So, but on the other hand of that,

603
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:39,699
all the money that comes into the, to the, to these channels, right? I have the YouTube channel

604
01:27:39,699 --> 01:27:45,850
that has ads on it. I have this Twitch channel, right? That has subscriptions, but if I were just

605
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:52,420
to pay for the show myself, all of these shows, they'd be gone. It just would. And I don't want

606
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:57,850
to do that either. I want to also obviously protect myself too. Cause yeah, could I write

607
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:05,560
a check to cover a $200,000 show? Yeah, but it would be fucking horrible. It would be painful.

608
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:12,329
I would be, I would lose a lot of my money. It'd be like, it would, it'd be, it'd be bad.

609
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:19,539
And I'm just trying to be realistic with you guys. You could with a bunch of question marks.

610
01:28:20,649 --> 01:28:28,710
No, I mean, I could, if I physically had to, I could move a bunch of fucking money around

611
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:42,409
and do it. And I did that before. I did it before. I don't want to do it again. Show ass

612
01:28:42,409 --> 01:28:48,699
resident sleeper. All right, that guy will do it. German rumble. Oh yeah. German rumble live.

613
01:28:48,699 --> 01:28:53,109
For those of you that don't know, I've told the story a few times. We're going to TLDR.

614
01:28:53,109 --> 01:29:03,739
I, that German rumble live action on the YouTube channel was about $10,000. It was a micro budget,

615
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:11,100
tons of stuff. We cut so many corners. And at the time I had like, I had like, I think I only had

616
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:18,949
like $1,500 to my name, like available. I liquidated my entire savings account. I had a 401k. I wiped

617
01:29:18,949 --> 01:29:26,149
out the whole thing so I could make sure to cover the show and pay bills and stuff. It was worth it

618
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:40,659
at the end of the day. 10k is a micro budget. Yep, it is. That was kind of stupid. It was,

619
01:29:40,659 --> 01:29:55,260
but the show happened and it was a great time. And I thought, I thought it was worth it. That's it.

620
01:29:55,260 --> 01:30:02,010
It was worth it. Did you recoup the costs? I mean, you could probably make the argument that over

621
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:08,310
the long term, probably. Yeah. That video did really well. I didn't recoup the costs on the

622
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:14,890
video. Cause I mean, ad revenue is not at that point. That was like 2015, 2016. I maybe made

623
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:23,189
back maybe 20, 30, maybe 20% from the video. I learned a lot, right? Like somebody said,

624
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:27,029
and a lot of people found that video and like the whole wrestling thing. And it just, a lot of people

625
01:30:27,029 --> 01:30:42,140
came to the channel and stuff. So, but that's, that's it, man. Every stream he loses 1.5,

626
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:51,369
$1.6 million. But I have to be realistic. I don't like, if I want to do two or three shows

627
01:30:51,369 --> 01:30:55,859
this year, right. And each one of those shows is going to cost somewhere between like, you know,

628
01:30:55,859 --> 01:31:00,199
if you think about like just cost of some of these pretty big projects, somewhere, somewhere

629
01:31:00,199 --> 01:31:04,439
up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, it'll be gone. All of my money will be gone.

630
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:10,489
And it's like, at that point, it's not worth it at that point, because seven years ago, when I was

631
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:18,579
still, you know, a YouTuber, I, you know, knew I had like 10 plus potential years in front of me.

632
01:31:18,579 --> 01:31:24,649
I don't know if I have that right now. I don't know if I have 10 plus more years of this in

633
01:31:24,649 --> 01:31:32,600
front of me. I don't know. I'm not certain of it, but I'm also not sure of it either. So right,

634
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:45,210
like almost seven or eight years ago, I knew I had the time. I don't know if I have 10 years.

635
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:50,329
No, we're not talking about retiring. Stop. I'm just saying 10 years is a long fucking time.

636
01:31:50,329 --> 01:31:55,289
He's not going to be streaming in 2033, because I don't even know what's going to happen in the

637
01:31:55,289 --> 01:32:00,090
next two years. I don't know what, three years, four years, five, I don't know. I have no idea.

638
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:07,340
Who's going to replace you? We already did that. But yeah, forget about, get that out of your head

639
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:19,939
right now. We're not talking about that. The goal was always, I try to get the shows paid for,

640
01:32:20,579 --> 01:32:25,189
not have to, because I don't want somebody, and this is another one of the reasons why

641
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:36,140
I pivoted away from, you know, talking about subs and bits and stuff. I just want to make sure that

642
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:40,779
these things can happen and nobody has to front the bill for it, especially with the kind of money

643
01:32:40,779 --> 01:32:46,840
that I fucking make, right? I just got to protect the future and make sure I don't go broke right

644
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:53,500
now. Why is your face so red? Because I just rubbed my eye sockets. You're making my girlfriend

645
01:32:53,500 --> 01:33:00,890
cry. What? What did I do? I didn't do anything. Hey, think about baseball coming up here.

646
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:11,109
Baseball stream. The German Baseball Association. Hope you can find a way to make it work. Yeah,

647
01:33:11,109 --> 01:33:20,199
I think we have some solutions. I think it's going to be fine. There's no cringe in baseball.

648
01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:37,260
Is it crying? Okay. Can you please smoke cigarettes on stream? What's your worst case scenario?

649
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:49,829
There is none. There is none. I mean, worst case scenario is, I mean, some, I don't know. I don't

650
01:33:49,829 --> 01:33:57,289
want to think of a worst case scenario. Stop reading smoking messages every stream. You know,

651
01:33:57,289 --> 01:34:06,869
that's true. But this whole thing went off because, you know, why just, just don't even do them. Just

652
01:34:06,869 --> 01:34:13,020
hang out and play games and stuff. And I don't want to tell you guys this is not true. It's not that

653
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:25,659
I'm over that kind of content. It's that I much prefer the other content. I'm much preferred.

654
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:32,710
If you guys go back to one of the Spider-Man update videos from like 2014 or 2015, I talked

655
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:37,510
about how much I wanted to do big projects. It was something I really cared about. And

656
01:34:38,069 --> 01:34:41,109
if I ever had the opportunity, it was when I was going to really pay attention to and really care

657
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:49,050
about. Here we are now. Like, this is what I care about. Is this a meatball? No, that's a pancake.

658
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:57,060
Hash house a go-go at the link in Las Vegas, Nevada. One of the best restaurants I've ever been to.

659
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:01,619
Got the best cheeseburger, best cheeseburger in Vegas without a doubt, without a single doubt

660
01:35:01,619 --> 01:35:13,050
in my mind. Nobody paid me to say this. It's just true. You look like a tourist. Why? Because I have

661
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:31,750
a t-shirt on from a restaurant? If you ever were to retire, would you announce it and quietly stop

662
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:41,819
or would you make one final bye-bye? What you can probably expect. Here's what you can expect.

663
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:46,779
Whenever this is. It's not tomorrow. It's not tomorrow. It's not tomorrow. It's not tomorrow.

664
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:50,699
This is not happening tomorrow. This is not tomorrow. This is not next week. This is not

665
01:35:50,699 --> 01:35:57,739
even potentially next year. I don't know. But what you can expect. This is not tomorrow. I will

666
01:35:57,739 --> 01:36:02,939
probably announce that I'm going to slow down. Because one thing I definitely want to do eventually

667
01:36:02,939 --> 01:36:08,489
when I decide to stop whenever that is, is I want to give at least six to 12 months to everybody

668
01:36:08,489 --> 01:36:14,100
of like still normal shit happening. But people know, right? This is not tomorrow. This is not

669
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:21,609
tomorrow. This is not tomorrow. This is not tomorrow. So I would probably give a long lead time.

670
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:32,859
Because people have subbed it for a long time and there's a lot of activity in the discord and shit.

671
01:36:32,859 --> 01:36:38,039
I want like a year of people knowing that that's going to happen, right? This is not something

672
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:45,189
that I would announce and then be like, okay, see you later. I was fun. Goodbye. I'm done. No.

673
01:36:45,189 --> 01:36:54,949
There'd be like a full year of lead up to it. So look, you got, hey, at the very least after

674
01:36:54,949 --> 01:37:11,079
tomorrow, you've got at least a year. Get away from the camera when I drink. I'm kidding. Just

675
01:37:11,079 --> 01:37:20,869
relax. Oh my God. It is tomorrow. No, I'm kidding. Show ass. All right. Time that person out. That's

676
01:37:20,869 --> 01:37:27,300
like the only thing they've written in the last like hour. I do have a great idea for my retirement

677
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:30,579
stream though. Like the final retirement stream. And I'll tell you what it is because I think it's

678
01:37:30,579 --> 01:37:38,090
funny and I don't care. Here's the idea. Don't leak this and don't steal it. I want to get in,

679
01:37:38,649 --> 01:37:45,239
I want to get in full old person prosthetics and in like a retirement home, be like sitting in the

680
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:57,159
corner eating peaches while people just roast me, you know, get, like get a bunch of people that

681
01:37:57,159 --> 01:38:02,439
have been like, you know, on the stream over the years sit and sit there and I can't even,

682
01:38:02,439 --> 01:38:07,850
I don't even know what they're saying. I've been full like $5,000 fucking old man prosthetics,

683
01:38:07,850 --> 01:38:13,829
like slurring peaches and look at the cane just like, and they'll like address me and stuff and

684
01:38:13,829 --> 01:38:19,880
I won't even look at them. And then I'll get up there when that's my time, right? When it's my

685
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:23,479
turn. All right. That was like, no, there it is the retirement. I get up there and I take the

686
01:38:23,479 --> 01:38:29,000
fuck the lashes off and I give one more, one more fucking, I tell you, you thought that was funny,

687
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:38,600
didn't you? And I, and I just go off and it's like, holy shit, he's still got it. There you go.

688
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:49,859
That's the whole stream. The final grandpa bit. If we leak it, he can't use it and he can never retire.

689
01:38:56,119 --> 01:39:07,640
One final sus face. What are you going to do when you stop doing Twitch? I don't know.

690
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:12,119
See, the reason why you can expect me not to retire like soon is because I don't fucking know.

691
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:19,260
I want to maybe transition over to more traditional content, right? I love making streams.

692
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:24,539
I love coming up with ideas. I love producing stuff. I love that. So maybe I would do something

693
01:39:24,539 --> 01:39:36,140
there. Try move into that part of the industry. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea.

694
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:47,579
You should run for president. Somebody, somebody would just leak the naked picture of the smite

695
01:39:47,579 --> 01:40:01,659
tournament and like, I would lose fucking half the country. I would lose like, I would lose like 30

696
01:40:01,659 --> 01:40:22,579
states in one hour. You'd get more though. No, I don't think so. Produce the next minions movie.

697
01:40:22,579 --> 01:40:26,760
You ever thought about doing a live show? I've thought about it before, but I think a lot of

698
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:33,020
the stuff that we do on this channel requires a lot of sort of camera tricks and magic behind

699
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,100
the scenes, right? I feel like a live version of a lot of the stuff wouldn't work that well,

700
01:40:37,659 --> 01:40:48,380
just because it needs a lot of sort of other stuff in the background. You've been recognized

701
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:54,680
in real life. Yeah, actually happens a lot more than you think. A lot more than I thought either

702
01:40:54,680 --> 01:41:08,890
too. Just go to Hollywood. No, I don't want to go to fucking Hollywood. If I go to Hollywood,

703
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:23,609
no, that's how you know it's over. That's how you know I'm retiring. No, not Hollywood. I wouldn't

704
01:41:23,609 --> 01:41:28,500
cut it in Hollywood. Nope. I would go to an audition. I would get told that I was not for the

705
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:37,750
part and I would cry on the way out and I would move. I would have the paper and I would be like,

706
01:41:37,750 --> 01:42:01,689
like, running out. Do infomercials? Well, you could be an actor. I don't know though. I don't

707
01:42:01,689 --> 01:42:10,979
know if I want to do that. Hey, Jeremiah, you ever show a barber a picture of a video game

708
01:42:10,979 --> 01:42:20,460
character when you get a haircut? What video game characters hair do you want? I don't understand

709
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:32,420
what. How come every time I comb my hair with a comb, it just looks like I have a toupee on?

710
01:42:33,239 --> 01:42:40,729
It's too smooth, right? This looks like I'm wearing a hair piece, but now,

711
01:42:43,609 --> 01:43:00,039
right? Now it doesn't. This is a little too long. It's okay. I'll grow it.

712
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:04,979
You show Steve from Minecraft. Will you ever get hair plugs? No. I'm just going bald whenever I

713
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:12,810
go bald. If I make it to 40, I'll be happy. Making it to 40 with a full head of hair is fine. I made

714
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:20,439
it to the level cap as far as hair goes. If you have a full head of hair at 40 years old, you made

715
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:39,380
it to the hair level cap. Good for you. You won. That's fine. Keep coping. It's 60. It's 40. I'll

716
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:54,220
give you 45. No, no grays either. No, not that I can tell. Not that I can really see. What's your

717
01:43:54,220 --> 01:44:08,310
secret? Okay. You want the secret. I drink green tea and I moisturize every day. That's it. I'm a

718
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:16,489
big green tea guy and I moisturize my face with a good moisturizer. Done. You eat garlic? I love

719
01:44:16,489 --> 01:44:31,989
garlic. Yeah, all the time. It's the Botox. Nope. I've never had work done. Dude, garlic is a secret.

720
01:44:32,789 --> 01:44:41,029
Garlic is a secret, but don't overdo garlic because it can actually be kind of not great for you.

721
01:44:41,029 --> 01:44:46,710
A nice like a nice green tea. What are your thoughts on the 2004 World Series squad for

722
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:53,210
the Red Sox? I have, okay, I'll give you an opinion on that.

723
01:44:53,210 --> 01:45:11,930
That song played in every business, on every street, in every house. It was background

724
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:22,779
noise. It was white noise for all of 2005 and 2006 after the Red Sox won the World Series.

725
01:45:22,859 --> 01:45:25,579
You'd be in the car with the radio on.

726
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,760
Okay, Boston, you're my home. Okay, let's go in this business.

727
01:45:43,479 --> 01:45:49,640
Dude, fucking airlines were probably like flights coming into Boston after the 2004 World Series.

728
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:54,460
It was probably like, ladies and gentlemen, we are starting our descent into Boston,

729
01:45:55,260 --> 01:46:06,359
home of the World Series champions. And they just played it. Five people know what you're

730
01:46:06,359 --> 01:46:24,100
talking about? Okay, this is what I'm talking about. This first 10 seconds was everywhere.

731
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:40,420
Oh, yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, we are starting our descent into the beautiful city of Boston,

732
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:51,000
Massachusetts, home of the World Series champions 2004. Cloudy day in Boston, 65 degrees. We're

733
01:46:51,000 --> 01:47:06,899
landing shortly. And everyone's just like, and everybody's in full Red Sox fan gear. Everyone.

734
01:47:06,899 --> 01:47:13,100
Everybody. They have a hat. They have a shirt. They have like wristbands. And then when it

735
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:24,170
when it gets to this part here, the whole fucking plane yells it. Hold on here. That dirty water.

736
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:28,970
Everybody. Boston, you're my home.

737
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:46,039
Everyone's just fucking everyone's just so happy. After 2004, my parents painted my room and made it

738
01:47:46,039 --> 01:47:54,760
Red Sox themed. Yes. And how many times did you open up the door to your house? And okay, hold on

739
01:47:54,760 --> 01:48:04,920
for all of you Boston East coasters out there. How many times did your parents watch the DVD

740
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:12,600
presentation of the World Series championship cowboy up? How many times did your parents watch

741
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:23,140
the cowboy up DVD after they won the special edition of the documentary of them winning?

742
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:30,149
I was probably once a week I would be like in my house and I would just walk I would

743
01:48:30,149 --> 01:48:35,029
be walking around and I would just hear like the intro to that to that DVD.

744
01:48:39,369 --> 01:48:55,989
If you're cute, if you're like, what the fuck is he talking about? They play this song at the end

745
01:48:55,989 --> 01:49:09,380
of every Red Sox win. If the Red Sox win the game at Fenway Park, they play this. No wonder you are

746
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:19,260
like this. This is so funny dude. Boston sounds like a cartoon town. It kind of is.

747
01:49:35,130 --> 01:49:44,949
Wait, didn't hold on. I feel like they did a cover. Did they do a cover? Is this I feel

748
01:49:44,949 --> 01:49:52,439
like I heard this one a shitload? Have I ever heard? Yeah, the Dropkick Murphys. Did they ever

749
01:49:52,439 --> 01:50:16,760
do a cover of this? I got an ad. Hold on. That's right. This is live somewhere. Listen, everybody

750
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:33,659
screaming. This was probably impromptu. Dropkick Murphys probably like, hey, Red Sox just won the

751
01:50:33,659 --> 01:50:57,270
fucking World Series. They're good too. They're residency for me. Fucking come on. What's up

752
01:50:57,270 --> 01:51:07,579
Germaniacs? Stop calling people Germaniacs. That's not the correct term. Stop saying that.

753
01:51:07,579 --> 01:51:13,750
I keep seeing that and it's kind of pissing me off. You're not the Germaniacs. No, you are the

754
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:20,630
Germimites. I don't know how many more times I have to say this. Not the Germimites. Germimites.

755
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:25,829
Excuse me, the Germimites. The Germimites. You're not the Germaniacs. Not the Germimites.

756
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:44,649
No, you're not the Germs. You are the Germimites. I keep seeing that. Drew Crew. I was there at the

757
01:51:44,649 --> 01:52:03,380
start when we were the Germs. Yeah. Yeah, you were for a while. Not the Germanians. Plus like. Yeah,

758
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:09,850
I remember at the end of every video saying, hey, plus like if you'd like the video. I never wanted

759
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:17,430
to say it though. I always hated saying it because to me it was like, oh hey, make sure you like the

760
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:23,699
video. Well, I don't know. Did they like it? What if you hated it? Then I look like a dickhead.

761
01:52:23,779 --> 01:52:27,619
Like you, I didn't want you to like the video if you didn't like the video. So I didn't want to

762
01:52:27,619 --> 01:52:33,300
look like a shithead and be like, dude, like the video. Make sure to hit that like button.

763
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:39,289
Well, dude, what if this video sucks? Then that's not accurate. You pressed like already. That's

764
01:52:39,289 --> 01:52:53,020
not accurate. I never liked to say that. Please rate the video. Yeah, there you go. That's better.

765
01:52:53,020 --> 01:53:07,220
Are you a gamer? I beat Cuphead a couple days ago in about an hour and 40 minutes. I would say so.

766
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:10,659
You played the organ during Dawnhouse. What instruments do you play? I know how to play

767
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:18,970
the drums. I know how to play the drums. Very sparingly. Not really though. Like kind of.

768
01:53:18,970 --> 01:53:31,159
Are you a guy that fell asleep to Five Nights at Freddy's? Um, very briefly. I gave the PAX East

769
01:53:31,159 --> 01:53:43,539
video one star. What's your favorite thing of all the stuff behind you? I can't pick, these are all,

770
01:53:43,539 --> 01:53:53,399
I can't pick a favorite child. Come on. I can't pick a favorite child. You have a vape pen? No.

771
01:53:53,399 --> 01:54:01,079
Didn't they ban, isn't vaping banned now? I read that. What happened? They banned vaping. The vape

772
01:54:01,079 --> 01:54:15,350
pens. Which ones? They banned Juul. Juul is banned in the United States now. What separated Juul

773
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:27,689
from all the other ones? Good night? Hey, have a good night. It's too much nicotine. Tons of

774
01:54:27,689 --> 01:54:52,579
nicotine and marketed to kids. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Juul appeals to young people. Big tobacco.

775
01:54:52,579 --> 01:55:01,289
The company was bought up by Philip Morris. Oh. They're banning disposables in the UK at some

776
01:55:01,289 --> 01:55:09,079
point. Saj, what will I do when I'm hammered on a night out? Um, you could not smoke inhaled nicotine.

777
01:55:11,939 --> 01:55:20,949
I know that's really easy to say, but cigarettes are bad. Nicotine is bad. Cigarettes are bad.

778
01:55:20,949 --> 01:55:23,829
Don't smoke. I'm not going to say that because like, look, I'm not going to tell you what to do

779
01:55:23,829 --> 01:55:33,140
with your life. Smoking is bad. You shouldn't do it. Vaping is an alternative. That's still nicotine

780
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:39,399
and still a bunch of bullshit you're inhaling into your lungs. But look, but I'm me sitting here

781
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:49,100
going like you smoke cigarettes, you vape. And I thought we could be friends. I don't, I don't

782
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:58,039
care. You know what I mean? You really shouldn't be doing it though. Right in the middle. Get it

783
01:55:58,039 --> 01:56:01,960
right in the middle. It's right in the middle. So, you know, these people can't be mad at me.

784
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:07,560
These, the smokers can't be pissed. The nonsmokers can't be pissed. We're right there. Perfect.

785
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:17,380
Perfectly placed. Cigarettes actually really piss me off though. They actually really do.

786
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:24,539
When they, okay, let me tell you something about cigarettes. Um, Las Vegas. No, you want me, you

787
01:56:24,539 --> 01:56:31,029
want a non-centrist Andy? Take fine. I'll give it to you. Cigarettes are fucking annoying. Okay?

788
01:56:31,029 --> 01:56:37,579
I live in Las Vegas, obviously, where smoking is, is allowed in the casinos. You can literally

789
01:56:37,579 --> 01:56:43,260
just walk around inside and smoke pretty much 90% of the entire floor. You can just smoke

790
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:55,510
in the casino. MGM, near the company MGM, they decided, they said, hey, um, we're going to make

791
01:56:55,510 --> 01:57:07,220
Park MGM smoke free now. 100% smoke free. I almost shit my pants because it's the only casino on the

792
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:14,460
strip. It's the only casino right now, I think, in Vegas that I can think of that is smoke free.

793
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:22,779
And oh my God, it's, oh, you mean I can, I can go like hang out and meet friends and there's not

794
01:57:22,779 --> 01:57:31,159
somebody like this, like this. My face, by the way, is right here. Oh yeah. Hit me. Oh, I'm sorry. Is

795
01:57:31,159 --> 01:57:37,239
that glove blowing directly into your nostrils? I don't fucking give a shit. Oh my God. Having the

796
01:57:37,239 --> 01:57:45,579
smoke free casino, doing more of them, more, more, more, more smoke free casinos. I, every time

797
01:57:45,579 --> 01:57:50,810
somebody ever comes into Vegas and they're like, oh, what do you want to do? Hey, um, you ever heard

798
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:55,609
of Park MGM? I mean, it's, it's a smaller casino. Um, it's, you ever heard of that? That's where you

799
01:57:55,609 --> 01:58:02,630
should go. We should go to Park MGM. I think it's like cool and clean. Park MGM. Like how do we show

800
01:58:02,630 --> 01:58:11,000
them that it's awesome? How do we show them this? Cause you know that they're definitely counting

801
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:17,930
fucking shit in the back room. I don't know. The whole smoking ban in Park MGM didn't really work

802
01:58:17,930 --> 01:58:31,689
out. We lost 10% customer base. Turn the cigarettes back on. I love Park MGM. Keep it smoke free. God

803
01:58:31,689 --> 01:58:47,369
damn it. I have nothing against people smoking a cigarette. What I, I don't, I just don't want to

804
01:58:47,369 --> 01:58:52,810
be sitting next to somebody at a blackjack table. That's just, that's just, I'm breathing in their

805
01:58:52,810 --> 01:58:58,729
cigarette for them. There have been cases when I've been down on the strip or downtown in Vegas,

806
01:58:58,729 --> 01:59:04,090
wherever I am, whatever is casino. And I'm just trying to hang out and I am smoking someone's

807
01:59:04,090 --> 01:59:08,869
fucking, I'm smoking someone else's cigarette. I'm that, that's, I'm that close. It's not like,

808
01:59:08,869 --> 01:59:13,189
oh, I smell cigarettes. There's a cigarette in this room. No, like you are holding it here

809
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:26,970
and my fucking face is here. I am smoking your cigarette. God, it's a tactic to win more.

810
01:59:26,970 --> 01:59:31,689
In blackjack, we all play against the dealer. There's no, you know, there's no psychological,

811
01:59:32,810 --> 01:59:41,979
you know, it's a poker. You want me to lose at the table? What are you talking about?

812
01:59:41,979 --> 01:59:47,350
Why would I, why would you want me to lose? We all play against the dealer in blackjack.

813
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:52,020
How often do you visit the strip? Once every, I want to say three or four months,

814
01:59:52,020 --> 02:00:13,850
once a quarter, maybe once or twice a quarter. Yeah. I, cigarettes, I just don't like them.

815
02:00:13,850 --> 02:00:21,340
Cigarettes have a very distinct smell too. That's just painful. I will smell weed, right? Like

816
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:29,380
somebody's smoking weed and it's like, Oh, somebody's, Ooh, Oh, somebody's smoking. What's

817
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:36,949
that? What's hmm. When I, a cigarette, it's like, I don't know where the fuck that's coming from,

818
02:00:36,949 --> 02:00:42,899
but I want to get away from it now. Okay. Yep. I think it's come, let's go this way. Come with me.

819
02:00:42,899 --> 02:00:55,500
Let's go over there. Let's, yeah, let's go this way. Like through there. If they're good cigarettes,

820
02:00:55,500 --> 02:01:10,630
it smells good. Weed smells good. We can, yeah, but also we usually, weed's a lot more powerful.

821
02:01:15,399 --> 02:01:21,579
What's on your shirt? Well, glad you asked. This is the Hash House A Go Go pancake. And by the way,

822
02:01:21,579 --> 02:01:32,359
that's actual size. By the way, that's actual size. Yeah. And by the way, actual size.

823
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:42,619
Do you want pancakes? Three o'clock in the morning and you're near the link. Hash House A Go Go. Best

824
02:01:42,619 --> 02:01:48,090
pancakes, best cheeseburger I've ever had. Best burger I've ever had. Weed smells like

825
02:01:48,090 --> 02:02:06,619
a moldy carpet. It's better than an old ass tray. Why did you staple a pancake to your shirt?

826
02:02:06,619 --> 02:02:13,510
That'd be weird. What's the burger? It is the blue cheeseburger at Hash House A Go Go.

827
02:02:14,069 --> 02:02:19,140
I gave you a secret message at the end of that. I don't know if you can decode it.

828
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:38,699
That's my favorite music. I really don't really listen to that much music. Dude,

829
02:02:38,699 --> 02:02:46,760
that pancake is bigger than your head. They're huge. Yeah, I know. You eat music. You're a blue

830
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:56,180
cheese fan. Yes. Yeah, I like it a lot. If you don't listen to music, what the fuck do you do?

831
02:02:56,180 --> 02:03:13,270
I don't know. Watch TV and work on stuff. Go out. Go to dinner. Take a walk. Run errands. What do

832
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:18,949
people do? No, you're not going to pull this shit again. Somebody said, like a couple years ago,

833
02:03:18,949 --> 02:03:22,149
what was it? They were like, oh, hey, man. Yes. Prove you're not a serial killer. What do you

834
02:03:22,149 --> 02:03:28,619
do for the other eight hours during the day? And it's just, I don't know, man. What the fuck

835
02:03:28,619 --> 02:03:32,659
do you do for the other eight hours or six hours during the day? What do you do for like eight

836
02:03:32,659 --> 02:03:41,500
hours during the day? I watch TV. I do run errands, do some chores, make phone calls,

837
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:50,630
talk to some people, spend time with some people. What else do you do? Play games. You play video

838
02:03:50,630 --> 02:03:59,770
games with, you know, get on Discord. What else do you do? And because I couldn't give five straight

839
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:07,670
hours of things that I would do after I turned the stream off or something, it's like you Googled

840
02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:27,989
what normal people do. I just told you how Park MGM, I love that place. Like, oh, I go to Park MGM

841
02:04:27,989 --> 02:04:36,220
and hang out. Who are you talking to? That joke is really funny, but I'm whatever. I laugh every time

842
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:53,850
I see that. Would you ever go to a non-YouTube or non-gaming convention, like an anime convention

843
02:04:53,850 --> 02:05:02,819
or a pop culture convention? Probably not. I did the convention thing for a long time. And I don't

844
02:05:02,819 --> 02:05:10,329
know. Probably not. Furry convention. I told you the only way I would go to a furry convention is

845
02:05:10,329 --> 02:05:15,939
if I was in a full costume and no one ever knew it was me. I may have already done this. I may have

846
02:05:15,939 --> 02:05:24,890
already done this. How would you ever know? Be in a full furry costume that has no ways to see who

847
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:37,180
is in there. And I have rooms at like seven hotels. So I could always like, wait, is that him? No,

848
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:40,699
I'm in a different, I'm in a different hotel tonight. No one fucking knows who I am. No one

849
02:05:40,699 --> 02:05:52,630
knows where I am. I genuinely believe we would know. No, you would not. You would not. How would

850
02:05:52,630 --> 02:05:59,180
you know? If I went to a furry convention and I was in a full fursuit and was just walking around

851
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:09,020
going like this, like, and I didn't do, I didn't move around too much and I didn't make it. I know.

852
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:22,420
Why would I be talking? I would not be, I would not say a single word. How would you ever know?

853
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:27,449
And then I would get to the hotel. I would go to the hotel room and make sure like I,

854
02:06:27,449 --> 02:06:35,100
nobody knew who I was. And then I would just take it off and go to bed. And every time I came out

855
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:44,979
of the room, I'd be in the full suit. So no one would ever know. Why would you know I was in there?

856
02:06:44,979 --> 02:07:00,329
You would be applying chapstick through the mask. Just like, you'd have wicked bad garlic breath.

857
02:07:00,329 --> 02:07:04,729
No, and I would not be doing any like, like movements. I wouldn't want you guys to know the

858
02:07:04,729 --> 02:07:14,789
movements. It would be super generic. Like that's it. I wouldn't do a single other move. There'd be

859
02:07:14,789 --> 02:07:33,930
no like walking, like, look at me. No, it would just be chills. I hate that. You ever happen to

860
02:07:33,930 --> 02:07:39,319
you where you're just like, you know what it reminds me of? Okay. It's, that's like a dog shaking.

861
02:07:39,319 --> 02:07:47,300
You know what I mean? Like, you've thought this through. Yes, we've talked about this more than

862
02:07:47,300 --> 02:08:01,539
once. We've, this is like the third or fourth time we've discussed this. You would not know.

863
02:08:01,539 --> 02:08:08,439
And honestly, I would never tell you. I would never tell you. You would never know. Years later,

864
02:08:08,439 --> 02:08:17,699
I wouldn't tell you. You would end up tripping up at one point. No, I wouldn't. You know why I

865
02:08:17,699 --> 02:08:25,930
wouldn't? Because I'm going to order three of the same exact costume, custom made, and I'm going to

866
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:33,770
hire somebody to go into that costume and go down to the convention floor on one of the days. And

867
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:41,239
I'm going to have that person take off the helmet and pose for a bunch of pictures and like drink

868
02:08:41,239 --> 02:08:52,279
out of a bottle of water, like very publicly. Like, and there you are. You would never know.

869
02:08:52,279 --> 02:09:03,819
You keep telling us what you're going to do. Yeah, but you, how do you, you can't even look for that.

870
02:09:03,819 --> 02:09:10,279
You, how would you even look for something like that? Oh, that person drank, drank water. Okay.

871
02:09:10,279 --> 02:09:21,319
That's literally every single person at the whole convention. Don't tell your secrets.

872
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:40,500
I could tell you all these secrets. It doesn't matter. Please let me make you a fursuit.

873
02:09:42,010 --> 02:09:51,859
No, how expensive would the fursuit be? I'm not telling you anything in case I ever decide to do

874
02:09:51,859 --> 02:09:57,859
this. They have to sign. Yeah. They would have to sign an NDA. Whoever that actor was, they'd have

875
02:09:57,859 --> 02:10:06,250
to, they would have to sign a document. Oh, but I would pay the fuck out of that person.

876
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:11,300
You know what I mean? It would be like, oh, hey, actor, what's your date? What's your day rate

877
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:16,300
to fill out? What's your, what's your like day rate as an actor? Okay. Triple it and sign that

878
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:48,119
paper. Triple it and sign this NDA. They ain't saying shit. It's 30K for three suits. Holy shit.

879
02:10:48,119 --> 02:11:08,920
What? It's 3000. It's wait, it's 10K for a big fursuit. What? Holy shit. 10K sounds like a lot.

880
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:21,909
3K. Okay. I could see like 5K, 10K, 20K, three to 5K. Okay. I mean, the materials alone are,

881
02:11:21,909 --> 02:11:26,170
are expensive and the obviously the grade of labor that goes into it makes sense, right?

882
02:11:26,729 --> 02:11:38,439
But 10 plus 20 plus thousand, 10K is for the popular makers. That makes sense. 20K for a

883
02:11:38,439 --> 02:11:54,680
high-end suit. Holy shit. New retirement plan. Some suit makers are really high in demand.

884
02:11:54,680 --> 02:12:02,680
Well fucking good for them. Holy shit. Chain mail is expensive. Wait, what do you mean?

885
02:12:03,479 --> 02:12:20,359
Chain mail. You're putting chain mail on too. You're putting on chain mail. Why are you putting on

886
02:12:20,359 --> 02:12:46,470
chain mail for defense? Parry the furries. When are you going to do the slime stream? What?

887
02:12:47,029 --> 02:12:55,659
Why are you making this so elaborate? Just wear a fursuit. It's 2022. But the fun is, is it,

888
02:12:55,659 --> 02:13:05,050
is it me? I don't care about putting a fursuit on. I just want it to be impossible for you to know.

889
02:13:05,050 --> 02:13:11,899
I don't care about wearing a fursuit at all. I just want it to be a mystery. You know what I mean?

890
02:13:20,170 --> 02:13:35,140
Schrodinger's furry. Am I in there? Am I, am I not in there? That's so stupid. How you been? I've

891
02:13:35,140 --> 02:13:45,609
been alright. I've been good. I've been pretty good. I'm in Vegas and I'm going to Hash House

892
02:13:45,609 --> 02:13:49,449
to go-go. I'm going to try it before I go home. Hope it's good. I haven't been there in a while,

893
02:13:49,449 --> 02:14:01,899
but it was good last time I went. I changed to 480p and the quality didn't change. Would you

894
02:14:01,899 --> 02:14:22,100
actually genuinely do this? Probably. I met Jeremy at a furry convention. I was at FurCon. I went,

895
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:33,899
there it goes. It's gone. Mods are on point. Dude, Mods are on point. That was there for as long

896
02:14:33,899 --> 02:14:44,579
as it took me to read the first four words. Gone. I have a debate with a friend. Is a hamburger

897
02:14:44,579 --> 02:14:59,270
outfit a fursuit? No. I mean, is it, are you, no, that's not an anthropomorphic animal. Wouldn't

898
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:10,039
that what it is? Is Grimace a furry? No, Grimace, what is Grimace? Is Grimace a furry? What is,

899
02:15:10,119 --> 02:15:27,340
what is Grimace? Grimace is an alien, right? What is Grimace? Grimace is a muppet. He's supposed to

900
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:38,579
be a nugget. No, really? Grimace is the cookie monster, but from McDonald's food. But what

901
02:15:38,579 --> 02:15:52,710
animal is Grimace? A bison? He's an eggplant. He's supposed to be a human. Wait, Grimace is supposed

902
02:15:52,710 --> 02:16:14,069
to be a guy? He's the purple cookie, but what is Cookie Monster? What is Grimace? McDonald's managers

903
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:23,100
clarify the character. Okay. The lovable spherical shaped purple character Grimace has always been

904
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:28,489
one of McDonald's most recognizable faces. Even if fans never knew what he actually is.

905
02:16:28,489 --> 02:16:34,969
Okay. Ronald McDonald is a clown. Mayor McCheese is a cheeseburger. Birdie the early bird is a bird.

906
02:16:35,610 --> 02:16:42,889
The Hamburglar is a thief. A Mac tonight is a moon. And the fry kids are fries. What the heck is

907
02:16:42,889 --> 02:16:50,219
Grimace? Okay. Nobody knew what he was until now. Late last month, the manager of McDonald's in

908
02:16:50,219 --> 02:16:55,270
Canada revealed the answer to the Golden Arches Biggest Mystery, telling CBC News that Grimace

909
02:16:55,270 --> 02:17:20,569
is an enormous taste bud. Huh? That's fucking inflamed. That shit's inflamed. I thought maybe

910
02:17:20,569 --> 02:17:30,790
it was a piece of candy. A gumdrop or something. Enormous taste bud? Can we just say he's a big

911
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:42,659
piece of taffy? That makes more sense. It's not inflamed. Wait, he also, wait, wait, wait, wait,

912
02:17:42,659 --> 02:17:52,950
McDonald's reached out. Hold on. McDonald's stepped in here. McDonald's offered some clarification in

913
02:17:52,950 --> 02:18:00,309
the statement. Whether he's a taste bud, a milkshake, or just your favorite purple blob,

914
02:18:00,309 --> 02:18:03,989
the best part about Grimace is that he means different things to different people. Whatever

915
02:18:03,989 --> 02:18:15,340
he is, we're just proud. Our bestie makes people happy. A milkshake? So he's a milkshake. He's a

916
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:24,979
bestie? Okay, into, hold on, it gets deeper. In 2012, McDonald's Corp tweeted from their official

917
02:18:24,979 --> 02:18:31,459
account that Grimace was, in quotes, and I'm quoting, the embodiment of a milkshake, though

918
02:18:31,459 --> 02:18:37,430
others still insist he's a taste bud. The account tweeted something similar in 2014 saying Grimace

919
02:18:37,430 --> 02:18:55,879
lore says he is the embodiment of a milkshake or taste bud. So he's a milkshake? That's a pretty

920
02:18:55,879 --> 02:19:13,100
gross ass milkshake. He's the embodiment of a milkshake. He's not a milkshake. He is the

921
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:24,149
embodiment of a milkshake. All right, so he's like a milkshake in theory. Thick? Creamy? What is it?

922
02:19:24,149 --> 02:19:44,540
What else is a milkshake? Biblically accurate. Juicy? Every time I see Grimace, I just think of

923
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:50,780
the Barney the Dinosaur jump run. You guys know what I'm talking about? The I'm in a mascot suit.

924
02:19:50,780 --> 02:19:55,459
I'm gonna do the excited jump run in the air for a quarter of a second where they go like,

925
02:19:56,020 --> 02:20:00,659
and their legs go one, two, three, four, da, da, da. They like jump and their arms go like this and

926
02:20:00,659 --> 02:20:08,149
their legs go like this and they kind of maybe go like that. It's the quintessential mascot is excited

927
02:20:08,149 --> 02:20:14,969
jump. I just see Grimace doing that. Barney the Dinosaur used to do this all the time.

928
02:20:14,969 --> 02:20:21,940
He would jump then his legs would go hoo hoo hoo. When was the last time you had a purple milkshake?

929
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:34,629
Never. We can hear your stomach? You probably can. Holy shit, you probably can. You can hear my...

930
02:20:34,629 --> 02:21:27,209
Stop listening to me. Don't do that. I'm hungry. He's trying to convince us that he's human. I have

931
02:21:27,930 --> 02:21:41,000
internal organs. I'm hungry. Go eat. This stream is not gonna be that much longer. I'm just gonna be

932
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:53,909
gone for a while. Well, not a while, like five days, four days away from the stream. He has a

933
02:21:53,909 --> 02:22:03,209
loudspeaker in his stomach. Oh, but when we come back, you'll see me again. You'll see me again.

934
02:22:03,209 --> 02:22:09,989
Maybe over there. You'll see me again. I'll be back. Not maybe. Of course I'll be back. When is

935
02:22:09,989 --> 02:22:19,780
the Castle Griffin's deed? I don't know. I have a bunch of mods I want to do for GTA V, Elden Ring,

936
02:22:19,780 --> 02:22:27,700
and Skyrim. We're going to leave that to next week. I've also got Call of Duty. Call of Duty

937
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:32,760
one campaign that I've been talking about for a long time that I want to play. There's also

938
02:22:33,479 --> 02:22:37,799
the jumping jack stream where I do 10 jumping jacks and then turn it off.

939
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:45,780
And that's what I did for work today. There's that. There's that important stream. There's

940
02:22:49,000 --> 02:23:06,940
the count stream where we count to a hundred. What about Grotto Beast? Grotto Beast is coming.

941
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:13,590
Grotto Beast is coming. I don't have a hard date for you, but it's this year, this year,

942
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:21,350
this year, actually this year, sooner than you think. Follow that Twitter. They post updates.

943
02:23:21,350 --> 02:23:32,870
Go check it out. Grotto Beasts. You'd never be able to count to a hundred and thirty minutes.

944
02:23:32,870 --> 02:23:34,950
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, four,

945
02:23:34,950 --> 02:23:40,729
five, six, seven, eight, nine, twenty. Did I skip a whole thing? Wait, what? One, two, three, four,

946
02:23:40,729 --> 02:23:42,729
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

947
02:23:42,729 --> 02:24:23,879
nine, twenty. It hasn't been thirty minutes. Dummy. Also the green screen stuff. If you want

948
02:24:23,879 --> 02:24:29,879
a submission read the rules you have until the 17th at midnight technically which is the 18th

949
02:24:29,879 --> 02:24:36,379
at midnight so midnight 12 o'clock july 18th whatever you want to call it that's when it's

950
02:24:36,379 --> 02:24:40,780
over read the rules if you want to do a green screen video there's a lot of things you have

951
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:45,049
to pay attention to and a lot of rules you have to follow so please follow them i've heard this

952
02:24:45,049 --> 02:24:51,159
some really good ones so far you got another week and a half or so to do it rules don't apply to us

953
02:24:51,239 --> 02:24:58,780
well then they're not going to be shown on the stream so i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm very sobby okay i'm

954
02:24:58,780 --> 02:25:20,409
sobby but if you do not follow the rules then i'm sobby it's not you're not going to be on stream

955
02:25:20,409 --> 02:25:28,549
auctioneer andy what do you say have you seen any of them i have peeked i did peek i've peeked a

957
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:44,680
and a half i want to do that actually there's gonna be some pretty cool the end of july is

958
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:53,750
gonna be pretty stacked baseball's happening on the 24th and then the next stream that i do coming

959
02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:59,139
back from baseball is going to be the green screen movie night i think that that would work out

960
02:25:59,139 --> 02:26:06,680
pretty well so there'll be two really really fun things in a row because i want that stream to be

961
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:12,700
somewhere in the end of july two weeks to have you guys make videos and then maybe a week to

962
02:26:12,700 --> 02:26:24,420
10 days to vet them get a good playlist do you think you bring back community content night after

963
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:38,790
i don't know maybe i would do an encore night again maybe maybe i don't want to say that oh

964
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:42,069
yeah let's bring community content night back because it's not inaccurate i'm just not prepared

965
02:26:42,069 --> 02:26:49,770
for it july 24th is baseball i know i've moved it three times now but desperately trying behind

966
02:26:49,770 --> 02:27:01,979
the scenes to make sure the show can go off in july and not have to wait any longer recommend

967
02:27:01,979 --> 02:27:08,600
video editing software um premier is good premier pro is just solid everything you need for it i

968
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:18,069
used to use it all the time it was my editor of choice when are you and stir going to do the

969
02:27:18,069 --> 02:27:22,870
remake and old channel vid yeah we talked about it we talked about it it's just stir got uh stir

970
02:27:22,870 --> 02:27:29,659
had a lot of stuff going on with myriad and i mean the dude's making a full entire from scratch video

971
02:27:29,659 --> 02:27:36,709
game rule set so he's he's pretty busy maybe i'll see if he's got time in the next you know month

972
02:27:36,709 --> 02:27:48,180
or so because i think that's a really funny idea i think there's a lot of potential for that one

973
02:27:48,180 --> 02:27:53,930
you're hyping up baseball are you sure it's confident as good as you want it to be i don't

974
02:27:53,930 --> 02:28:02,229
know i've never thought like that though even before stuff like dollhouse or the replacement

975
02:28:02,229 --> 02:28:10,299
show or the desert you know grotto beast thing carnival i i just think i'm just gonna if it's

976
02:28:10,299 --> 02:28:20,280
fun it's fun let me try usually they are you might be under hyping baseball the reason why i have

977
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:27,500
not been going heavy into baseball is because we didn't know for sure the day and we had to

978
02:28:27,579 --> 02:28:34,500
keep changing it so you see how a month ago it was the 14th of july then it became the 20th now

979
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:41,059
it's the 24th so now that we get a real day and a real date we're going to lay into a lot of uh

980
02:28:41,059 --> 02:28:49,579
probably a lot of pr for it so don't worry you will know you will see but yeah i'm just going

981
02:28:49,579 --> 02:28:54,260
to get up there and try to have fun and try to do the stuff that i wrote down on a piece of paper

982
02:28:54,260 --> 02:29:09,020
that's it hey uh will you apologize hold on for laughing at me because i said i watched the care

983
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:15,030
bears at 24 my life's been an absolute shambles since i didn't i didn't my intention was not to

984
02:29:15,030 --> 02:29:26,620
make fun of anybody i don't care what you're watching you put shambles in all caps though so

985
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:36,920
i'm kind of no no no i'm not laughing at the fact that you watch care bears i'm laughing at the

986
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:42,780
scenario of me apologizing to you for laughing at you for watching the care bears you understand

987
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:50,540
that's a there's a lot going on around this it's not just one little thing i don't care i don't

988
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:57,379

997
02:31:27,670 --> 02:31:36,360

1022
02:34:51,129 --> 02:35:00,250

1023
02:35:00,250 --> 02:35:08,090
