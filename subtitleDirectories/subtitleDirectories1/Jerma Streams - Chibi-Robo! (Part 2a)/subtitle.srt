1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:01:01,049
Good afternoon. Where's my coffee? What? It disappeared. I'm here now. Hello everybody.

2
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:15,400
Good afternoon. We're going to continue Chibi-Robo. Now if I finish it tonight, that's a question.

3
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:25,299
I should. I don't see why I will not, considering there's only about six hours, seven hours left

4
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:33,980
in the game. We should do it tonight. Thank you for joining me. Taking an extra second. Why am I out

5
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:40,379
of breath? If I, well, I guess I just sprinted. That makes sense. Yeah, I did just sprint.

6
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,939
I hit the mute button. Yeah, I'm an idiot. I hit the mute button. I got up and I like

7
00:01:48,500 --> 00:02:02,650
grab. We got a long hallway. So I'm good. Are you guys ready for Chibi-Robo part two?

8
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:09,259
Coffee's worth it. Yes, it is. It's always worth it to get a coffee.

9
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,139
Mansion. Yeah. When you describe to people that you're full sprinting for more than three to four

10
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:23,219
seconds down your hall, you have a, I guess you have a big house. It may have been embellishing

11
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:32,650
a little, but anyways, let's go. I don't need to wait because I don't need to introduce this

12
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,889
because we just did it yesterday. And I, here we are. Caffeine is terrible for you.

13
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:57,860
Yes. Or bananas, apparently. Yeah. Don't have it. I don't ever do it. Sorry. I don't ever do anything

14
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:04,819
wrong, right? Don't ever drink caffeine. Don't ever fucking go to an R rated movie, right? Don't

15
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:15,240
ever do anything wrong. Only drink water and sit in your house and lie in your bed and look at the

16
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,800
ceiling. And every so often get up and stretch and only eat lettuce. Um, well, lettuce is bad for you

17
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:37,620
too because fucking the Romaine scare. Yeah. Literally don't do anything ever. Way ahead of

18
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:45,849
you. Live the tortoise life. Oh, don't be in the water because there's all the bacteria and all

19
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:52,620
the fucking gross shit in the water, in our oceans. No, no, don't go swimming. Don't drink coffee.

20
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:07,289
The only thing that you should do is fart on your webcam. That's the only thing you should be doing.

21
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:15,539
Well, what the fuck can I do then? You tell me. All right. So, uh, I have to go upstairs.

22
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,879
Quick recap. I'm a household robot. I fix things. I help with the family. I put sugar in people's

23
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:29,639
cups. I clean stains off the ground. Uh, mom and dad are about to go through a divorce probably.

24
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,069
Typical robot helper robot stuff. So we're going up to mom's room right now to find out what's going

25
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:47,540
on, which was the foyer, which we're going to go this way. Yep. Frash. Get it. Oh yeah. And there's

26
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:57,990
a dead frog outside that I could have saved four hours ago. Wait, I want to give, um, Ribbit Girl.

27
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:11,660
Ribbit Girl's very sad, by the way. Ribbit, maybe. What is this? Is us in, is, is, oh wait,

28
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:23,339
I think that's the other robot. Yeah, that, that, because that's, that's the old robot. The, the one

29
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:41,939
that everyone was their best friend. Yaybit. 13 happy points. Spread the happiness. That's you and

30
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:50,810
her. We also, we have a con. Yeah, we do. We have frog rings. We have to collect frog rings for her.

31
00:05:50,810 --> 00:06:06,810
She loves them. And there's, I think, six or five more in the house. How many more? Five more. Ribbit.

32
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:16,230
Everybody loves Chibi Robo. I, where's the trash can? I gotta, I have a lot of trash. Remember I,

33
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,189
remember I went underneath, um, her bed and I picked up like three years worth of trash

34
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:30,920
under the bed. This game is dumb. I really don't give out permanent bands that often.

35
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:58,519
Don't make me start now. Hey, we got a Wink. Look at all this trash. Ten. Oh, look at that mound of

36
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:09,050
spitballs. I have two boxes. Yep. Wait, no, no, do I, no, I already fed the fish plenty of time.

37
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:19,639
44 happy points. Holy shit. Wet to dry in one frame. Well, you can tell when I was sitting here

38
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,480
testing and making sure it worked and everything for the first time. You can tell when that was.

39
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:38,939
And it's like probably 40 minutes ago. All right, wait, I'm gonna clean. See, I'm helping.

40
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,759
As per the title of the livestream, I'm going to help. Show memory card are emulated. You can,

41
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,589
I don't care if you think this is emulated at this point. That's not like some thing that I'm

42
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:55,879
going to be like, how dare you? No, not me. I don't care. You, if you, if you think this is emulated,

43
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,439
I'm glad. If you think this is on original hardware, I'm also very glad. I'm very glad

44
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:09,939
about those things. I don't care. He did show the memory card. He slammed it in a door. Yeah,

45
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:20,939
I did two days ago. All right, it's time. It's time to go into mom's room. What's in mom's room?

46
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:36,970
First, let me charge the emulator. This is pre-recorded. Don't stop saying that. You're

47
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:43,590
going to get me in fucking trouble. I haven't turned on an actual live broadcast in like two

48
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:59,799
and a half years. It's not fucking with my game. All this is pre-recorded. I just, I sit here with

49
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:07,340
it on one of my monitors while I'm watching lost right now on my other monitor. I'm in season four.

50
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:20,470
It gets good, right? And I just chime in sometimes. You want to know how to use the warp bot. Oh yeah,

51
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:27,539
this is new. Insert your plug to power it up. When the energy field appears, climb on top of

52
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:32,340
the utility bot and automatically be transported to the other warp utility bot. Well, where is it?

53
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:45,100
Let's test this. This is the foyer. It goes to, that's a adorable sound. It just goes upstairs.

54
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:56,460
Oh, wow. That's better than having to fly over on the banister. I'm really,

55
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,620
really happy you said season four. It's the best season, Jerma. Thank you. I'm looking forward to

56
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:12,779
it. All right, sorry. Back to the regularly scheduled pre-recorded Jeremy. Okay. Gotta clean

57
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:24,700
this up. Good, good. Happy points for that one. Okay. 165 stains. Time for a cleaning bonus.

58
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:36,149
Happy points. Oh, the reverb is on. There was a lot of reverb on there. I was trying to make it.

59
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:50,019
Whatever. The reverb was dialed up a lot. I got a lot of points for that. Why does reverb equal

60
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:56,019
pre-recorded? Well, because that means I've opened 30 windows within a 10th of a second

61
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,129
of the same stream. That's what that means. Sorry, guys. I fucked it up. I'll fix it.

62
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:25,980
I'm getting the trash. I'm going to go to mom's room. That would be a delay echo.

63
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:34,120
Not if they were all opened within a 10th of a second. You would hear a lot of reverb.

64
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:44,820
He's wrong. Wrong. I'm an audio engineer. I went to school for audio engineering. I think I know

65
00:11:44,820 --> 00:12:16,039
what I'm talking about. So did I. Show degree. Well, I never said I graduated. I said I went.

66
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,070
I mean, I did pretty poorly and had been stopped after about two classes.

67
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:35,379
All right. Let's go in mom's room. Let's find out what's going on. It's time.

68
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:55,429
We're going to find out what's in here. Here we go. He was a neat. All right. Bedroom. New area.

69
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:03,500
What is the secret in here? There's a frog. Specifically, there's an alive frog right here.

70
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:25,190
It's dead, too. Dead frogs everywhere. What's that? Let's go and have a closer look.

71
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:38,840
It looks like a frog. But how horrible. Who could have done such a thing?

72
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:49,750
You think it could have been Tao? I mean, maybe the dog could have picked it up and

73
00:13:50,710 --> 00:14:02,919
thrown it around. Probably. It's possible. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I can't

74
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,980
jump to conclusions like that. I don't know. Yeah, you're right. He already has plenty of

75
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:20,149
food and bones and stuff. I mean, who could have? Huh? It's a Tyrannosaurus Rex stuffed animal in

76
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:32,149
this room. Chibi robo. There's something over there. What are you talking about? There's

77
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:42,009
nothing there, Tally. Wait a minute. It really was something over there. I'm going to go take a look.

78
00:14:47,320 --> 00:15:06,549
Okay, so another dead frog. I don't know what to do. Poor guy. Yeah, what am I supposed to do?

79
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,110
I need water. All right, we got to get a good, we got to make a perimeter here.

80
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:23,100
Ticket stub. Wait, can I drag this? Save him. I can't. Holy shit. I'm strong. What's in here?

81
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:36,360
Can I open the briefcase? There's probably something in the briefcase, right? Charge the frog.

82
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,759
That's not going to help. Let me clean under the bed first and we'll figure it out.

83
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:51,860
What's this? For seat one, chibi robo equals crazy moola. I'm very expensive. Okay. Well,

84
00:15:51,860 --> 00:16:01,259
we knew that. Charge the frog. Charge the frog. If I put the plug near that frog,

85
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:11,190
it's going to zap him and kill him. So, no. Why would I use a defib on a frog that's currently

86
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:21,620
breathing? The frogs, that's not the point. What are you talking about? Why would I use a defib

87
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:30,950
on a frog that's awake and alert and breathing and has a heartbeat? He's just thirsty and there's

88
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,590
another one outside that's also thirsty. I just need thirsty. I need to, I can't wake him up. What

89
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:54,090
do you want me to do? Absorb his power. All right. I got to look for some other stuff in here.

90
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:59,940
How about, um, wait, I can go on top of this. Can I, can I drag this all the way over? How far

91
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:08,650
can I bring this? I can't jump on top of here. It won't open if you don't know the correct password.

92
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:19,319
Oh, we need the pad. This is the secret right here. That's the secret we need to know the

93
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:25,660
password. We've got to find out. We've got to get the password from mom, right? All right. In the

94
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:31,660
meantime, let me go over here. Isn't mom going to know that I, that somebody was in looking at the

95
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:52,680
briefcase? Wait, what about the shoes? Anything hidden? Point. Pull it out. I'm going to pull this

96
00:17:52,680 --> 00:18:06,009
up. Is there a bug up here? There's a demon door. Mom's going to give us her password.

97
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:19,269
Oh, there's a lot of trash on mom's desk. Jeremy, what's your social? Oh, that's easy. Uh, zero,

98
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:37,539
zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, one. I was the first person. Can I get up there?

99
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:44,089
I got to climb. Same joke years later.

100
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:55,769
Pogchamp. Dude, Pogchamp. Remember when he did that like in 2014? Probably. I don't know.

101
00:18:56,329 --> 00:19:10,009
Is mom going to be mad that I'm in the bedroom cleaning? Let's get a good view. All right. We

102
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:18,309
got dead frog. This other side ticket stub. Holy shit. We'll get all those doors up there.

103
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:29,400
All right. I'm going to try to, how do I get up there? That's a lot. Get on the fan. Get on the

104
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,509
fan. Get on the fan. I mean, I can't right now. I got to find a way up there. Let's do the baseline

105
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:45,140
stuff first. Like over there. I got to get up there on the window sill. What is that? What the

106
00:19:45,140 --> 00:20:07,380
hell is that? All right. Investigate. Mission. You need to recharge your, yeah, me. I need to

107
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:14,569
recharge me. You're right. It's a good tip. Can I get up there? Can I climb anything over this way?

108
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:28,869
Is that these ladders? Yes, they are. You almost fell for it. Almost. You got a keyword there.

109
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:41,319
Almost. Can I turn the radio on to turn on the turntable? I should be able to. All right. Who

110
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:58,710
the hell is this? I pull the thing and hmm. I can't grab that. It's like a flower freaking out

111
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:13,319
over here. I got to open up the window. I can't get up there. Can I shoot it? Yeah, look, it's

112
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:29,579
right there. Can I dislodge it? Maybe I can dislodge it. Shit. I want to get up there.

113
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:51,130
Can I climb anything else? Hey, let me in. Oh, well. Maybe I need something else. What's this?

114
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:59,160
I can't interact with the big speaker thing.

115
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:24,069
Shit. I need the, I need the big, I need the ladder. I think there's not, I need the,

116
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:26,789
okay, there's a briefcase in here, but I can't do anything with the briefcase.

117
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:51,740
I guess I can land on this. Anything on here? Can't climb this. Oh, well. Oh, wait, what's that?

118
00:22:52,460 --> 00:23:00,230
Look at that. We need the passcode for the briefcase, but I can pull this.

119
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:18,630
Is this the blinds? A hat? Oh, it looks like you can use this to climb up. All right, well.

120
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:31,660
Don't water the frog. I can't. I don't have a means to. Woody Woodpecker charge noise.

121
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:56,890
That's pretty good. I love it. All right, let's climb up this shit. I hate that Woodpecker. Why?

122
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:05,700
Why do you hate Woody Woodpecker? How do you even hate Woody Woodpecker? It doesn't make any sense.

123
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:34,839
Why? Bell? Ring the bell. Wait a minute. This is gonna, I stand on it? This is, I can't hit it.

124
00:24:34,839 --> 00:25:04,119
I'm trying to ring it. Oh, what does that do? Somebody to come open the door? Uh, ticket stub.

125
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:07,960
Can I fly from here? No, I definitely can't fly from here. I'm just gonna land on the,

126
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:28,890
I mean, I rang the bell. Hello? The fuck is this? Who lives in here? You open the peephole.

127
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:37,930
Now you can pass through here at night. Oh, now I can come in here at night. Shortcut. Nice. All

128
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:51,779
right. Well, how do I, can I climb up this? Look at this. Oh yeah. Look at that frog ring over there.

129
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:02,359
All right. I'm going to go fly over this way. No, I can't make it. All right. Well, I'll come back

130
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:17,430
at night. Let me see where this goes. Oh shit. How do I? Okay. Then I can climb up. Okay. I can climb

131
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:23,559
up the, this thing over here. Let me see. Yeah. So I can climb that all the way up. Good. Good to

132
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:45,980
know. All right. Cool. Did I miss anything else in, uh, in the kid's room? Yes, you did. Well,

133
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:55,640
let's go take a look. Remember, it didn't wink. I fucking, I have a thing that tells me if there's

134
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:02,250
winks, the winks, the winks are real and I didn't even look. I just believed you for no reason. I

135
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:17,059
have a, is today the last wink day? No, it'll be a day or two. Like it's going to be, uh, Tuesday

136
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:37,140
is the last day for wings and they're going to be significantly reduced in price. All right. Let me,

137
00:27:37,140 --> 00:28:06,779
uh, do something for it. We can go talk to the Frankenstein guy, but hold on. So almost out of

138
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:13,579
time though. I had to put this trash, I see trash and I need to get it. I'm obsessed with trash.

139
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:20,579
I'm obsessed with it. Look, I, I, it's wasting time, but I have to open this and go get it.

140
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,180
You see, I've wasted so much time. I have to pick up every piece of trash.

141
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:44,470
I think I leveled up too. All right. It's nighttime. We can go into mom's room at night.

142
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:57,180
Great work out there. Let's adjust your happy points. What about my ranking? I am now in the

143
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:04,299
top 10 of all chibi robos in the world. Special gift, a brand new bonus battery.

144
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:14,630
1800. Yeah. 880. So good. Top 10 chibi.

145
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:31,910
I do have money though. Let's see what I want to spend it on. Top chibi streamer. Speech, speech.

146
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:41,539
Guys, I just want to say I never would have got here if it wasn't for all of you leaving

147
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:48,410
your cans and bottles scattered throughout the house and not walking even two feet to the trash

148
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:55,829
can and for dropping oil all over the ground and never cleaning the vents above your stove.

149
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:16,279
Without this, I never would have made it. Thank you everybody. Range chip, passive aggressive speech.

150
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:27,930
We'll start cleaning. How's that for aggressive aggressive? All right. I'm going to get the

151
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:39,670
range chip. Fire long distance blaster shot. I want it. And I also want another battery too. Yep.

152
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:53,480
Kitchen bridge. A bridge that stretches far placed near the planter. All right. I got,

153
00:30:54,039 --> 00:31:20,279
I got so much to do. You're an asshole. You made my daughter cry. What? All right.

154
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,519
Let's put the rest in here.

155
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:49,579
I'm sorry. I tried to do it exact. I got caught. All right. Uh, I can, I have to do a thousand at

156
00:31:49,579 --> 00:32:07,579
a time. You're doing diva. Diva is Elmo is Gollum. We want shit. We need shit. Diva reporting for

157
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:24,619
duty. It's also one of the Ed brothers. It could be anyone, Eddie. It could even be Elmo. It could

158
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:42,150
be anybody. Plus two, hire him. Something about being available. All right. Let's go to, uh,

159
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:52,420
let's go to mom's room at night. Mom's room at night. Where's the warper in the foyer behind me?

160
00:32:52,420 --> 00:33:17,420
I can't stop thinking about woody woodpecker. Yeah. It was a great reference. Great.

161
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:58,650
Let's hear it again. No, I love it. I can't wait to hear it again. All right. Into mom's room.

162
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:09,579
Anything new? Okay. I teddy bear. I went, I went into mom's room. Mom locks the door at night and

163
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:24,309
she leaves the door open all day. I'll handle this. Diva Gollum, double D Elmo quad impression.

164
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:40,619
Why did you even clip that wrong door? So what does this change at night or something?

165
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:57,510
Is mom just in here sleeping? Is there anything we do because like, is there something we can do

166
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,710
while mom is asleep? Like go in her drawer and find a key or? I don't understand. Why would I

167
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:09,320
do this at night? Does mom like bring like this password up here and put it somewhere? I don't

168
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:38,010
understand. Well, we're going to find out. What are we going to do? These bills are piling up.

169
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,840
On top of that, the electric bill has skyrocketed. See, I am a problem.

170
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:59,380
He's just hopeless. Okay. We need to, that is what if I make, what if I make my presence known?

171
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:13,829
What is that up there? Wait a minute. What is that? You see this thing? What is this? Like a secret.

172
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:33,820
Hi mom. Uh, is it something? Should I make my presence known? Say hello? Uh, yeah, I guess I

173
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:43,079
could say hi. Hi there Chibo. How'd you get in here? Did you come to check on me because

174
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:59,400
you were worried about me? Yes. Thank you Chibo. 52. I bet Jenny and her dad asked you to check

175
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,840
up on me. Well, since you're here, would you mind keeping me company? I'm balancing our

176
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,480
checkbook, but something just doesn't add up. Oh, you want me to do math? I'm exhausted.

177
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,719
I wonder if there's a toy receipt I'm missing. I bet he's hiding one somewhere.

178
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:20,460
It was a receipt. I asked him about earlier and he said, don't worry. You have all,

179
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,130
that was a great impression. When it comes to toys, I don't know if I can trust him to have

180
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,329
any self-control. Oh, can you do me a favor Chibo? See if you can find a hidden toy receipt. I think

181
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:36,860
I know where it is. Bring it back to me if you find one. If you do, my husband will have explaining

182
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:43,000
to do. Isn't it like right here? GB robo. Crazy move. A hidden toy receipt.

183
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:53,110
Shit. That's not it. Oh mom, you're gonna do anything about the dying frog in the middle of

184
00:37:53,110 --> 00:38:05,239
the room. He's just sleeping. No, I don't have it in my inventory. It's hidden somewhere. Hidden

185
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:19,349
receipt for a toy. Let me check up here for a second. I still have to throw my trash away. I

186
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:30,550
have a lot of it. Anything over here? I thought those were Pop Tarts and a toaster. That's my,

187
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:35,269
that's my actually, actually mutated brain. Just thought that. It's like, oh, Pop Tarts and a

188
00:38:35,269 --> 00:39:00,650
toaster. Let's plug it. Let's go to the other room. I can't connect. You're connected. You're

189
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:16,280
right here. Toy receipt. Where does dad even hang out? Does dad only hang out on the sofa? Is that

190
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:36,730
it? On the toilet. Dad hangs out in the bathroom. He saw the receipt already. Well that, no, that

191
00:39:36,730 --> 00:40:00,300
was the Chibi robo one. That's not the right one. Dad lives in the walls. It's a wall dad. God. I

192
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:14,039
want to go back into Jenny's room. I didn't explore everything in Jenny's room. I picked up

193
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,920
trash and had to leave. I wish I could use the Stuart Little Car, but that's unfortunate. I can't.

194
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:42,409
Why? Why is she so sad? Well, she's upset that her parents are not getting along. It's kind of sad

195
00:40:42,409 --> 00:41:00,280
because she's really sad. I'd hate to see their electric bill. Yeah, she was talking about it.

196
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,840
All right. What have we got? Okay. Thank God. Let's dump all this crap. I have a lot of it.

197
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:29,639
Look at that. Like five wrappers, can of orange juice, party poppers, wads of junk. What's the 1500?

198
00:41:39,219 --> 00:42:00,599
Okay. What are you doing here? Hello, space hunter robo. Look at that. That towering castle

199
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,019
and all the way at the top of it. What do I see?

200
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:16,090
Oh, a delightful damsel. He gazes down at me with lost eyes. I can tell her heart aches for justice.

201
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:30,710
Listen, he's jumping. Space hunter code. He's going to jump up to that table and try to jump

202
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:36,650
to the microwave and fall five times and then fucking leave. Be like, never mind. This game

203
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:45,860
sucks. Drake Redcrest must speak to her. She needs my attention. However, a minor obstacle stands in

204
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:54,730
my way. How am I supposed to get up there? One called Mort will know what to do. I'm at a loss,

205
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:03,289
but the destiny of a space hunter is to find the truth. All right. Well, hold on. Let me,

206
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:11,289
let me just get up here. Wait, is he talking about the guy under the bed? He's talking about the

207
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:21,860
Frankenstein guy under the bed? He was a syringe? That's a squirter from a doctor's kit.

208
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:29,750
It's probably Jenny's. Looks like you can pull up water with it. Bingo. You can spray it on all

209
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:49,659
sorts of things. We just saved the frog. Wow. Yes. Okay. Cool. Oh, is this a TV?

210
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:10,780
That was a really good show. I love the part when the bear got mad at the honey not being in there.

211
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:42,840
Can I get on top of the TV? I still have time to explore in here. Why not? Bear actually mad.

212
00:44:43,639 --> 00:45:05,449
Bear actually. Wait, that was telling me something. No, you can't just jump. The bear was mad about

213
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:37,079
the pot. There's music. Well, let's get up here. Red shoe. What is this? Whose shoe is this?

214
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:51,929
This is a mushroom? Oh, it's a break mushroom. You shouldn't be slacking off.

215
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:18,010
Get back in there, champ. I can't get over there. Can I go down here? I can maybe sneak in this.

216
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:29,340
If I hover, I think I can sneak in there. Yeah, I can. I definitely can. Do I even need to?

217
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:39,480
I don't think I even need to. What the fuck? Did I just clip through?

218
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,500
What the fuck are you talking about? Why am I clipping through this?

219
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:21,670
Toe. Toe. What? Toe. Toe. Toe. Toe. Toe? Toe. Why is everyone saying toe? I don't get it.

220
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:29,380
You're confusing him. Yeah, you are. Very much so. I don't know what you're even talking about.

221
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:38,630
Let's go talk to this guy. Oh, someone did a juke with a toe. Okay.

222
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:45,449
I get it, I guess. Although I don't. I'm going to pretend I get it.

223
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,969
Let's talk to the bumming again.

224
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,480
Will you listen to my story? Yeah.

225
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,800
It's about the other night.

226
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:37,110
Why is the bear attacking? Stop, stop. You're going to break it.

227
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:44,579
Okay, I got that. That's the shoe for the girl up there.

228
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,179
That is what transpired.

229
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,039
The lovely Princess Pitts hasn't left her castle since then.

230
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:00,199
Her bare foot causes her terrible embarrassment, I'm sure.

231
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,880
I'm very worried about her.

232
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:14,539
If you find the red shoe, please let me know. What? You've got the red shoe?

233
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:22,889
I've got the red shoe. Come back up. It's really elaborate and probably pain in the

234
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:25,369
ass to get in and out of here. I don't know why you didn't ask first.

235
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:42,940
Did you find the shoe? There it is. Yes. Hurry up and give it to Princess Pitts.

236
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,860
I can't go into the castle because my body won't fit. Another one of life's little

237
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:52,860
disappointments. I put a flight of stairs in front of the castle. Go ahead and use it.

238
00:49:54,619 --> 00:50:05,210
Oh, shit. They gave us a way out. What's a button on the back of you do?

239
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:13,940
All right, let's charge up and then try to go up to the top of the castle.

240
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:23,510
I need an outlet. Where's an outlet? Only one outlet in this whole room.

241
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:57,260
It's just bad bedroom design. One outlet. All the way over here. Can you play the piano?

242
00:50:57,739 --> 00:51:07,130
Is it a battery? Oh, I'm gonna be able to get that. I can't pick those up. Here we go.

243
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:15,699
Let's make our way up. This is gonna be a puzzle. Not really. Not that big of a deal.

244
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:29,099
Now, what is this? Battery. Double A battery. Okay, more items. Can I jump from here to there?

245
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:35,110
Nope. I don't know if this is like Zelda or something where if I got to the edge,

246
00:51:35,110 --> 00:52:05,030
I just did it. Okay, pull these. And then can I- whoo! Jump onto the heart thing and we float.

247
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:17,380
This really is Jump King. What's this? This is where you inserted a double A battery. Ah,

248
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:43,800
nice. I want to hear the whole song. I wonder, should I- I was gonna get on his head and then

249
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:50,739
we float from here. This game is so cute. It really is. It's just adorable, the whole thing.

250
00:52:51,380 --> 00:53:04,019
All right, keep going. Dude, I just smoked like two grams. What the fuck is this?

251
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:17,980
Dude, I just smoked two grams. No one said that. Yes, they did. He said, man, I just smoked two

252
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:28,760
grams. What the fuck? Why? Why? I don't need that info. I don't need- I mean, that's fine, but I

253
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:44,539
don't- I don't need that info. Should I go left or right? Go right. Oh, the gosh. The

254
00:53:44,539 --> 00:54:25,030
the perspective. It was just wrong. Back to the sewer. I didn't want to wait. Bye. Okay, we're

255
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:47,239
good. I need another battery. I need another battery. Fuck. Where's there another double A

256
00:54:47,239 --> 00:55:42,500
battery? A D battery. Shit. Where's there a D battery? Man! I'm gonna have to do it tomorrow.

257
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:56,699
Throw the trash away. I need a D battery. I wonder, is that in here? It's probably on the other side.

258
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:04,360
I just went the wrong way. I went right instead of left. End of the stream voice.

259
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:15,219
I just started like 45 minutes ago. What are you talking about? Oh, because I keep saying

260
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:38,980
tomorrow. I'm gonna have to say in the game. Coin. I'm gonna go down the slide too. Cool. You ready?

261
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:47,239
Oh, I did the slide wrong. I'm actually- I'm annoyed by that. Okay, water. I gotta get- wait!

262
00:56:47,880 --> 00:57:06,489
What's in here? Why is this like this? Cat can't distinguish the game and reality.

263
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:16,440
Term is an eggplant head. What the hell is that? What's up? What? What is that? What's that thing

264
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:31,590
on your- 20. What's this 20? Twitchcon Amsterdam. What? Eggplant head.

265
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:41,030
That's what it's like when kids first learn the word eggplant. They start calling each other

266
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:48,389
eggplant head. Eggplant head. Eggplant head. It's because they just found out what that word was.

267
00:57:48,389 --> 00:58:08,570
They ate it like three days ago. Eggplant head. Stop it. Stop calling me that. If German reads

268
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:34,219
this out loud, I'll do 20 push-ups and 50 squats. Good luck. Go for it. Back to what we were doing.

269
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:45,610
No, I want water. Where do I get water? Can I get it from a sink? My wife ever finds out

270
00:58:46,570 --> 00:59:03,190
I'm in huge trouble. This should be a safe place. All right. The receipt is in the couch.

271
00:59:03,989 --> 00:59:13,050
Receipt in couch. I'm going to get it. I'm getting it, dad. I'm going to get that chip right now.

272
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:19,719
No. Yeah, I'm going to get that. Wait, I got to- I'm over- I'm too excited to like-

273
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:47,059
I'm too excited to snitch on dad. Hold on. There it is. He really doesn't go anywhere

274
00:59:47,059 --> 01:00:01,110
besides the couch, does he? Let's get the crumbs. Bro! What's wrong, chibi robo? Toy receipt? I have

275
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:07,909
no idea what you're talking about, silly robot. Oh, by the way, the room looks really clean today.

276
01:00:07,909 --> 01:00:27,860
You must have worked so hard. Toy receipt. No, no, no, no, no. You found it. Ew. Well,

277
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:44,230
don't tell my wife, all right? Oh, I want to pick the trash up. Why would it be ew? All right,

278
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:57,880
we got to go to mom's room at night. We got to show her. Do we have any more of those things?

279
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:19,590
I don't have any more of those things. Rings. No. Gone. Man, the news is boring. What a snorefest.

280
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:28,920
Hey, chibi. Can you change the channel, buddy? The amount of work it takes for me to change the

281
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:34,599
channel on the TV is astronomical. Do you see how small I am and how little- how much is it

282
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:41,780
going to take me to do this? It's going to take me so long to do this. I have to go get my ladder.

283
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:49,110
You can't just sit up and press a button. Look at what- I want you to watch this whole time.

284
01:01:49,989 --> 01:02:02,619
Dad. I don't even know where it is. Where's my elevator? I have to go- I'm going to do it.

285
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:16,820
It's a happy point. Save the frog. Frog comes after TV. Don't worry. No, it doesn't. Yes,

286
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:22,650
it does because I'm currently in the room. Look, let me just change this lazy motherfucker's TV

287
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:40,940
channel. Imagine watching this from the couch. Chibi Robo. Yes? Change TV channel. Yes, sir.

288
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:56,969
Wow, what's taking this thing so long? Lag. Lag. What do I have for ping?

289
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:21,239
This thing sucks. Fuck, man. What the fuck are you doing? Chibi Robo. Yes?

290
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:29,860
Change TV channel. Yes, sir. No, no, no. You were already going up. This fucking thing sucks.

291
01:03:30,420 --> 01:04:05,269
Return this thing. Oh, this won't work. Oh, hooray. I've done it. What the- Hey. Hold it,

292
01:04:05,269 --> 01:04:21,429
hold it. Whoa. It's Drake Redcrest. Thanks for the- Dad just gave you 19 happy points and $50.

293
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:39,449
Fuck you, dad. I'm going back to the news. Wait, no. No, stop. Put it back. Put it back.

294
01:04:42,619 --> 01:04:56,500
No, no. Keep it on the news. No. You piece of shit. How will I ever be able to change it again?

295
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:10,199
No, look at him mocking me. Look at him mocking me. How dare you piece of shit. And then all

296
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:17,159
of a sudden from above the screen, smash, a fucking shoe, a foot, crushes Chibi Robo.

297
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:32,119
All right. Can I get water out here? I don't think so. All right. I did what dad wanted. Let's plug

298
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:44,519
in and let's go back. I love this game. There's so much to do. Bad ending. Yeah. Then it just

299
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:51,769
shows dad going into the store with the receipt. Yeah. I don't know what's wrong with it. Okay.

300
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:56,920
You just returning it? Yeah. It just stopped working. There's a piece missing, I think.

301
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:11,929
Okay. Thank you for the return and exchange. Yeah. Yes. Alex, I'll take every single time

302
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:19,590
someone's ever returned something to a store for 500, please. Stop throwing shit at me.

303
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:30,550
This happened five times. Yeah. Why are you keeping track of how many times people have thrown

304
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:47,800
dinner plates at me? Oh, whatever. Let's go. Because it's funny. All right. We're going to the,

305
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:54,789
what do I want to do? We're during the day. We've got to go back to mom at night.

306
01:06:54,789 --> 01:07:00,070
So I do have access to, I have access to the kitchen because I got the ladder for the kitchen.

307
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:10,019
You can give it to her in the day. Oh, you can go to the sink. There's no water in the sink.

308
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:19,449
All right. Where's my, uh, the thing that I bought? I just bought it. Where is it?

309
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:30,340
Is it, is it, oh, it's up, it's up on top. Why is it up on top? Okay. Well, we have to get up there.

310
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:40,869
Hold on. Did I already go up? I think I did this already, but

311
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:51,739
worth a shot. It's to reach the spoon. Ah, this tiny husband video is weird.

312
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:11,820
Husband, husband video. Why does it have to be a video? What do you mean this?

313
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:28,539
Oh, and I guess it is a stream, but tiny husband. Oh, I can think of mom can just put us up there.

314
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:50,149
Can't you step on the lever of the toaster? I just tried to go. So did you find the toy receipt?

315
01:08:50,789 --> 01:09:04,069
This is important. Do we, um, it's do we sit? We'd sit. Yes, we do. Sorry. I mean,

316
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:12,199
come on. We got so hot rod. Where's the receipt? The husband, we got to get this free, you know,

317
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:17,510
the husband's really, there's a lot of fault has to lay on the husband here.

318
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:29,779
She said he spends all their money on toys. I mean, we got to stop that. Another Red Crest toy.

319
01:09:30,739 --> 01:09:39,430
I told him that these toys are a waste of money. Doesn't he listen? Is he deaf?

320
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:54,949
God, my husband is so stupid. Thank you, Chibo. I think that was worth more than 30. Spread the

321
01:09:54,949 --> 01:10:07,460
happiness. Aren't I spreading sadness and discourse? I've had it with that man. He can do the housework

322
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:15,270
himself then. I don't even want to look at him. Spread the happiness. Forget this. I'm going to

323
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:25,699
lock myself in my room. You want to explain this? Oh, where did you find that, sweetie?

324
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:31,939
Doesn't matter where I got it. Another toy. What is wrong with you? That's it. I've had enough of

325
01:10:31,939 --> 01:10:46,939
this family. I'm locking myself in the bedroom. Oh man, I'm in a world of hurt. Spreading happiness.

326
01:10:47,739 --> 01:11:05,960
Happiness being spread. Tearing entire family apart. Oh, shit. Uh, okay. I got to get up here.

327
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:21,210
I just need a spoon. It's all your fault. It's not all my fault. They're hiding things from each

328
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:28,470
other. They're lying to each other. Like, this was going to fester for another 10 more years?

329
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:52,329
No. Wait, can I suck this up? Water. Yeah. All right. Put it away. Is this like soapy water though?

330
01:11:52,329 --> 01:11:58,659
I'm going to spray soapy water into a frog's mouth. What's all this chemicals in this shit?

331
01:11:58,659 --> 01:12:07,829
There's like chlorine in this water. Frogs can't have chlorine. All right. Let's do this.

332
01:12:24,699 --> 01:12:35,619
Chemicals in the water. I mean, it's the frog. I play this game a few nights ago with my daughter.

333
01:12:35,619 --> 01:12:41,350
My son is playing Chibi-Robo. And in Chibi-Robo, there's frogs. And let me tell you something.

334
01:12:43,350 --> 01:13:10,779
They had a water system in that game. This is real life. Bug. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop here.

335
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:21,560
Stop here. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop it here. There's little robots running around. And that's

336
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:28,539
the future. That's our future. That's our future. We're going to Bernie. Whoops. And these little

337
01:13:28,539 --> 01:13:34,439
robots, they're supposed to be doing housework and cleaning up after you. But it's not happening.

338
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:39,319
It's not housework. They're going to take over. These robots are going to get AI and we are dead.

339
01:13:39,319 --> 01:14:05,979
All of us. Everybody, you know. That's a kid's spoon. Alex Sanders. Bernie Jones.

340
01:14:05,979 --> 01:14:10,460
I mean, here's the thing. Wall Street. What we're going to have to do is we're going to have to

341
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:17,510
break up Wall Street. And let me tell you, I drank water today. A little too much water. And it's

342
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:41,270
flooding my lungs, I think. The chemicals that are in this water. They're too much. A demon door.

343
01:14:45,369 --> 01:15:01,140
Alex, Alex Beetlejuice Sanders. All right. Fuck. But the problem here is it's not about just the

344
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:06,899
banks. It's about the fact that I'm living on this bottle. And this bottle, it needs updating. I'll

345
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:12,789
tell you. The tree over there hasn't been watered in over three days. Three, four years, I think.

346
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:34,170
Nice fucking bottle is what I got to say to that one. Bernie Beetlejuice Alex. I don't even know

347
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:46,550
what that was. I got the spoon. Let's plant a plant. And I got the demon door too. I got a demon door.

348
01:15:53,689 --> 01:16:01,100
How come nobody's made like a Beetlejuice Alex Jones edit? That's perfect. With the music in

349
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:17,239
the background, it would be perfect. Let's slow down. You just do it right now. I'm playing

350
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:28,859
Chibi-Robo. How does it feel to be 6'10"? Feels pretty good. How about that? Not very many humans

351
01:16:28,859 --> 01:16:49,619
are that tall. So, I mean, funny. Oh, he's on his way. What? What the fuck are you talking about?

352
01:16:49,619 --> 01:17:08,060
He's on his way? All right. Let's do some planting. Okay. Now let's plant a seed. Let's plant

353
01:17:08,869 --> 01:17:18,710
nectar flower seed. Look at this. You can't grow a nectar flower here. Let's put it away.

354
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:55,189
Oh, fuck you. Fuck you. Blue flower. Hey, look. Now we need to water it, right? Is this doing

355
01:17:55,189 --> 01:18:41,670
anything? Well, okay. I can't aim. There's no first person. Oh, sorry. I attacked somebody.

356
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:52,020
I just had to attack somebody about something real quick. I'm good. Let's plant. I want to plant

357
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:58,439
the other seed. I have two more flowers, right? Yeah. White flower seed. I put them all here.

358
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:21,430
Is there a reason to not do this? I guess we can. Does it make mom happy? I'm sure it does.

359
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:41,369
Don't jump off the edge. All right, we're good. Okay. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

360
01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:46,409
Now I have water. In fact, I'm going to fill it up completely because I used it.

361
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:55,380
There's a lot more water that's in here than I picked up. They're very liberal with that.

362
01:19:56,020 --> 01:20:06,810
That's like not even a teaspoon of water, so that's cool. Frogs dying. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

363
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:31,819
I'm not out of... Oh, I am out of time. See you next time. The frog's been dying for two weeks.

364
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:51,529
Well, we're about to go rescue the frog. Let's just run in a circle. Whoa. Fight. Fight.

365
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:25,449
Holy shit, chibi. Holy shit, chibi. What was that? Chibi. Holy shit, chibi. I love saying that word.

366
01:21:41,750 --> 01:22:04,520
Yes, save. Save. All right, timer. Run out. I bought the... Yeah, I bought 15 minutes, so

367
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:18,949
we have a lot of time. Remember, you're killing my ADHD. I have it too. Don't worry. We both have it.

368
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:27,079
We both have it. Don't worry. It's like a disease. Hey, we both have it now. Like what?

369
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:53,739
It's like a virus. Gloves. What the fuck? You're very liberal with your assessment of ADHD, guys.

370
01:22:54,300 --> 01:23:30,779
Okay. Relax. Would you like to save? Sure. Call it out. Liberal ADHD. What the fuck is going on?

371
01:23:32,569 --> 01:23:39,930
Hey, everybody. Somebody said the word liberal three times. I heard somebody in this chat room.

372
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:48,010
It's me, Bernie Sanders. Bernie Alex Jones Sanders. Somebody said the word liberal. I hear you. I said

373
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:55,159
I felt it. What are you going to do? Try to take over our entire world? Not on my watch. Not until

374
01:23:55,159 --> 01:24:02,149
we break up the banks and until we get out. Get back in the box. You're taking me back in the box.

375
01:24:02,149 --> 01:24:05,829
You did this joke two years ago, German. Now let me tell you about it. Get out of there.

376
01:24:46,979 --> 01:25:12,310
German, you're scaring Chibi. Fucking music. Oh, shit. I muted the... What? What happened?

377
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:30,220
I didn't... I mean, I knew... I thought it was off. I thought I turned it off. Oh, the frog. The frog.

378
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:49,000
The frog. We're gonna go, go, go, go, go. Frog, frog, frog, frog, frog. Worst joke of the last

379
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:58,630
two decades. What are you talking about? I was just attacked. I was just attacked.

380
01:25:59,189 --> 01:26:29,020
Was that... That's funny? Attacked by Bernie Jews. Wait, can I dig right there? All right. Yeah,

381
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:34,859
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

382
01:26:34,859 --> 01:27:06,340
yeah, yeah. He's still alive. Told you. Here, look what I got. Frida just gave you seven happy points.

383
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:30,260
Frida. Again. Spread the happiness. Come on, Frida. Ribbit, Ribbit, Ribbit.

384
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:34,100
Thank you for giving me the water I so desperately needed.

385
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:41,609
I will commence the nuclear attack on this country. Good day. Oh chat, what the

386
01:27:41,609 --> 01:28:01,750
fuck? The frog seems to be saying something.

387
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:06,420
I don't understand this strange language. Chat, what would you maybe do? What the

388
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:18,949
fuck? Frog suit. Well, I'll never take this off. Thank

389
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:25,430
you, Ribbit. I'm fine now, thanks to you. My boyfriend's lost in that house and

390
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:30,729
I'm tired of waiting around. Now that you're one of us, you can speak

391
01:28:30,729 --> 01:28:38,630
Ribbit-ese too. Cool, huh? Isn't it just the greatest?

392
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:51,510
Now that we can communicate, I have to ask you a favor. If you find him, I want you to

393
01:28:51,510 --> 01:29:00,789
bring him here. Okay. Super frog. Okay, so what a great

394
01:29:00,789 --> 01:29:08,409
costume this is. I know where he is. Show Jenny the frog

395
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:15,319
suit. Show Jenny the frog suit. I will, after I do some cleaning.

396
01:29:15,319 --> 01:29:30,279
Who cares about cleaning? This is a frog game. This is a cleaning game with frogs

397
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:33,420
in it. Sorry, I have to correct when people are

398
01:29:33,420 --> 01:30:00,060
wrong. This is a frog cleaning game. Well, it is now.

399
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:24,539
All right, let's see what the pose is. That takes... Okay, I'm gonna die.

400
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:44,649
Run. Run. Run. Use spoon to dig up the... Yeah, I gotta dig up the bone.

401
01:30:44,649 --> 01:30:53,180
I'm out of power. I need to plug in. Press Z and wait. Well, I'm out of

402
01:30:53,180 --> 01:31:00,279
power. I'm gonna die if I do that. No, don't say

403
01:31:00,279 --> 01:31:16,250
F's. No F's. Yes, I am. F is cancelled.

404
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:28,470
Yup. Okay, I will hold down Z now. We'll see what it does. Ready?

405
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:40,220
Nothing. You just... That's it. Imagine having a device

406
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:47,270
that did one small animatronic movement and needed to take thirty dollars of

407
01:31:47,270 --> 01:32:01,779
your power bill. This is not efficient at all. Uh, cleaning

408
01:32:01,779 --> 01:32:11,319
game first. It takes more power to do a single frog

409
01:32:11,319 --> 01:32:14,039
hop than it is to clean a whole living room.

410
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:36,279
I think there's a bug there. Bonus! Happy point bonus is...

411
01:32:36,279 --> 01:33:14,039
32. Nice. 132 bucks. You gotta keep the house clean otherwise

412
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:18,220
people lose their minds. The right one is my favorite. Middle one

413
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:28,550
is my favorite. All right, now we're gonna go

414
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:33,510
bring the other frog back to life. We'll have to speak frog to the frog

415
01:33:33,510 --> 01:34:07,420
and bring the frog back here. Feed the frog sand instead of water.

416
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:28,300
All right, we need to go to the upstairs. Jenny, what are we gonna do? Your mom is...

417
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:38,630
That was what? I thought that was mom again. Mom is what? Your mom is what?

418
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:56,789
I gotta get over there. I gotta go. Hurry, save mom. I'm going.

419
01:34:56,789 --> 01:35:10,250
What should we do, Jenny? Mom is, uh, ribbit ribbit.

420
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:21,000
Huh? Wait, that's it. I can look through these slats. That's my smart girl.

421
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:29,100
Ribbit. It's no use, kiddo. My face is too big. I can't see inside.

422
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:46,760
Give me a hand, Jenny. Oh, Chibi Robo. She locked herself in the bedroom. I'm a

423
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:50,119
little worried about her. I need to see what's going on in there.

424
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:55,289
I can't see through the slats. I'm sure she'll be happy to see you. She's not mad

425
01:35:55,289 --> 01:36:10,489
at you. Can you help me out? Hold on. Let's get the fucking paper.

426
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:23,609
Cheese crumbs and whatever the hell this is. Book? Oh, well, this is your book.

427
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:31,340
All right, let's go. I'm in. I'm in. Go check on my wife and see what she's up

428
01:36:31,340 --> 01:37:08,119
to. Say you'll do it. I'm begging you. Okay, she's sleeping. Dead frog. Hey,

429
01:37:08,119 --> 01:37:49,659
you. Get up. Keep her up. Are you still here? What the hell? A Lego dinosaur.

430
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:09,239
I hope it has the Rex's voice from Toy Story. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Look at

431
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:22,739
the size of that thing. Chibi, what do we do? Goodbye. You're going to leave?

432
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:43,210
You're going to leave me? Is mom awake from this? Oh, you're right. My teeth.

433
01:38:44,859 --> 01:38:59,619
You're made of metal. Goodness gracious. I can't be running around without my teeth.

434
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:10,180
Hold on there, you little varmint. I need my teeth. It really is the guy from Toy Story. Here,

435
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:20,409
Dinah teeth. Take it. You can have back. Can I have whippersnapper? Give me my teeth.

436
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:39,380
Bombers not to bite me. Thanks, Junior. This ain't much, but you go on and take it.

437
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:43,859
Dinah gave me more happy points than everybody in the whole house.

438
01:39:44,659 --> 01:39:52,250
Sorry, I don't need the money. I want the happy points. I mistook you for one of them dang frogs.

439
01:39:54,729 --> 01:40:05,779
What do you expect? My eyes are going and you was dressed all in green. I guess it was fate that

440
01:40:05,779 --> 01:40:21,140
brought us together. Stop by if you need anything. You hear? Bye now. Well, we made a new friend.

441
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:59,020
It was the frog. We lost the frog. Lening game first. Ease out up. 20, 30 happy points

442
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:03,100
every time I do that. That adds up. I've done that dozens of times. It's worth a ton of points.

443
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:16,500
What happened? I've got to get back to Frida on the double. Will you take me to the backyard?

444
01:41:18,859 --> 01:41:31,270
Yes. Really? Truly? I'm counting on you, Ribbit. Not yet.

445
01:41:45,029 --> 01:42:02,970
Counting on you, losing for dead. I did not. When I find that motherfucker that's doing that,

446
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:08,859
I'm going to spray them with water. That's not going to be water in that thing.

447
01:42:10,729 --> 01:42:17,609
I'm going to go. I'm going to suck up something from the drain and squeeze it. Spray it. All right,

448
01:42:17,609 --> 01:42:39,449
let's go. Mom? Fantastic. More receipts. So many bills. Oh, look at you dressing up like Jenny.

449
01:42:39,449 --> 01:42:43,770
Why don't you go show her? I bet she'd get a kick out of it. Very nice. You've been cleaning

450
01:42:43,770 --> 01:43:07,079
up the house. Thank you, Chibo. All right, we're going to take this off. More receipts, more receipts.

451
01:43:07,079 --> 01:43:28,310
Oh, my husband must have sent you in here. Oh, well, it's not your fault. But let me tell you

452
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:36,329
something. He's not getting off the hook until he's sorry for what he did. Chibo, could you

453
01:43:36,329 --> 01:43:45,960
give my husband this letter? What's a letter? What do you mean, this letter? Shit. Uh, okay.

454
01:43:52,550 --> 01:44:01,159
Thank you, Chibo. He has to understand. Okay, I'll give the letter. All right, Frog, let's go.

455
01:44:01,159 --> 01:44:05,239
Wait, I have to be dressed like a frog. Otherwise, he won't trust me. And I can't talk to him.

456
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:31,579
All right, let's go, Frog. Take some of this. Let's go. Okay. Are there breathing holes in my body?

457
01:44:32,380 --> 01:45:06,489
Put them into the trash? I can't. I don't think that'll even work. All right, let me out. All

458
01:45:06,489 --> 01:45:22,199
right, Dad. I've got a letter for you. I need him to fish. Dad, are you still out here? Jenny,

459
01:45:23,319 --> 01:45:54,100
where's Dad? Rivet. Did the evil frog wizard put a curse on you too, Chibi-Robo? Yes. Yeah,

460
01:45:54,100 --> 01:46:09,779
that's what I thought. Just like me. Looks very good on you. Holy fuck, that's a lot of points.

461
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:27,989
I can only speak to other frogs. How do you do, Rabbit? I mean, Rivet. Can I talk to the bear?

462
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:37,739
Chibi, thanks for checking on Mom. Looks like Dad's asleep. He'll be up in the morning.

463
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:55,289
Everybody's sleeping out here. Why don't you need to go to sleep? You're like three. You need more

464
01:46:55,289 --> 01:47:12,729
sleep than all of us. You need to be in bed. Hey, look, I can't sleep. I wish everything was all

465
01:47:12,729 --> 01:47:49,449
better. Jesus. Mm-hmm. It's traumatizing. This is pretty fucked up. It is. All right. Dad's going

466
01:47:49,449 --> 01:47:51,689
to get up in the morning, which means I don't think I can do anything. Can I wake him up?

467
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:06,869
I can't. Okay. Can I do anything else today? I could probably float from, hold on. There's

468
01:48:06,869 --> 01:48:21,449
other stuff down here that I can get from up here, isn't there? Hey, what are you doing here? Frog.

469
01:48:21,449 --> 01:48:37,050
Hey, but hold on. What are you doing over here? Hey. Well, all right. Let's go bring the frog to

470
01:48:37,050 --> 01:49:03,029
the backyard. Okay. Back to the living room, which is over here. Jenny's too close. Oh, okay. That

471
01:49:03,029 --> 01:49:17,420
makes sense. Have I been to the basement? Yes. I have the charger. I haven't put any money in it,

472
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:28,520
though. I currently got a family I'm trying to work out their problems. How is divorce any percent

473
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:52,520
coming along? Not sure. A couple of these. That's worth a lot. Ten. Very good. Thirty-nine happy

474
01:49:52,520 --> 01:50:00,539
points. I got to be in like the top five at this point, right? Have to be. You think I'm going to

475
01:50:00,539 --> 01:50:05,739
be a Chibi-Robo? I'm going to be top five Chibi-Robo in the world and let a piece of trash sit up here?

476
01:50:06,819 --> 01:50:36,840
You are mistaken. Sorry. You wish you were top five. Oh, oh. Oh, I am top five. When I go back and

477
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:47,140
charge up, you'll see. I'm going to fill this up, though. I'm probably going to need this for

478
01:50:47,140 --> 01:51:09,319
something. I want a full water syringe. All right, frog. It's time to reunite. I wonder who the worst

479
01:51:09,319 --> 01:51:20,329
Chibi-Robo is. I don't know. That's a good question. Okay, frog. Here we go. Here comes the reuniting of

480
01:51:20,329 --> 01:51:34,600
the frogs. Hello, Frida. I have someone. How long is that loser boyfriend of mine going to keep me

481
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:48,489
waiting, Ribbit? Honestly. Yeah, I found him. He was lying down on the ground. I think he was

482
01:51:48,489 --> 01:52:03,399
shit-faced. Frog divorce present. Fred, you're still alive. You sure got yourself into a mess.

483
01:52:03,399 --> 01:52:19,909
Frida, I'm done for Ribbit. I got mistaken for food and chewed to bits. What did I tell you? That

484
01:52:19,909 --> 01:52:28,090
house is dangerous. You got hurt because you didn't listen to me, as usual. Don't talk so loudly.

485
01:52:29,529 --> 01:52:36,140
My head still hurts. You don't know what pain is, my friend, but you're going to find out pretty

486
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:50,010
soon. What? Maybe I was better off as a dinosaur snack. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

487
01:52:50,810 --> 01:53:00,100
Sorry if it caused you any trouble. See you later. Wait, wait, was that meant?

488
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:10,069
Help me! Help! You just wait for what's in store for you. Holy shit! Do I go in there?

489
01:53:10,069 --> 01:53:28,539
How do I do help him? Hey! Oh my god! Get out of there! Spreading happiness, as usual. Can I do

490
01:53:28,539 --> 01:53:44,439
anything right? Everything I do just goes horribly wrong. Should I? Oh, this thing's a dig up over

491
01:53:44,439 --> 01:54:26,890
here. What is this? Okay. What is it? More digging? The tank? Oh, it's the hidden pirate ship.

492
01:54:27,850 --> 01:55:03,939
Ah, why don't I just unearth? Good job, you unearthed ghost pirates. Do I hop aboard?

493
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:34,899
A ghost problem solved. It's so scary. Can I dig in here? I just like the song. That was cool.

494
01:55:34,899 --> 01:55:57,699
So I gotta go talk to the pirate again. What else? I'm gonna run out of time. Don't dig too deep. Get

495
01:55:57,699 --> 01:56:26,600
the bone? Dog bone. Oh, all right. There's bone over here. Really? I can't dig this up? I guess I

496
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:46,979
can. Is it up enough for me to grab it? Dog bone. Okay, nice. Give dog bone to the dog?

497
01:56:47,699 --> 01:57:14,789
Should I have a lot of these flowers? Oh wait, there's nectar in here! Oh! All right, put that

498
01:57:14,789 --> 01:57:39,000
away. Plant the nectar seed. Come on! Drained all the nectar. All right, I'm gonna be top five.

499
01:57:41,979 --> 01:57:49,750
At least six. I got a lot of points. Good morning. Let's adjust your point total.

500
01:57:50,710 --> 01:58:05,340
Oh, well, I made it to nine. Top nine. Citrusoft is sending you a brand new bonus battery. It'll be

501
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:18,979
at 200. Yeah! 394 more points. All right, I also have to... I got money and I got scrap.

502
01:58:19,939 --> 01:58:39,340
Get the backup batteries? I have one already. All right, let's do some scrap. Kitchen bridge,

503
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:43,180
living room bridge. A bridge that stretches far placed on top of the bookcase

504
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:50,279
or the kitchen one. Place near the planter. Which one of these is more useful?

505
01:58:51,239 --> 01:59:05,960
One in the kitchen. Chibi-Robo, put your scrap into the recyclotron and then I'm going to dump

506
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:18,390
all this money into the battery. Save giga-robo. Yeah, I'm going to put the money in here. I'm

507
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:43,670
going to do 2,000 gigawatts. Do you want to charge it? Yes. 2,000. 2,000 kilowatts. Fill it!

508
01:59:43,670 --> 01:59:55,989
Ooh, that was not very much at all. Did I break it? Something seems a little off, but...

509
01:59:56,949 --> 01:59:57,750
Oh, well, never mind.

510
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:16,170
Okay. Well, I'm going to go pee. I'll be right back. See you guys in like two minutes.

511
02:00:16,810 --> 02:04:07,779
Can I ask if I just press the unmute button and fucking scream as loud as I could?

512
02:04:08,579 --> 02:04:24,710
Okay. It's a new day. Time to give dad the letter. How dare you? No, no, no, no. That's not cool.

513
02:04:24,710 --> 02:04:35,029
That would be so bad. All right, dad, I got a letter for you. Where's dad? Dad not on couch.

514
02:04:37,899 --> 02:04:49,399
Dad not watching TV on couch. Weird. Is he still upstairs? I mean, it's a cleaning game first.

515
02:04:50,359 --> 02:05:48,260
I put on my wizard robe for this. What? It's a cleaning game first. It's a cleaning game

516
02:05:48,260 --> 02:06:05,300
first. Divorce game second. All right. That's right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

517
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:13,300
Four for footprints. These add up. They add up. Guys, doing side quests gives me sometimes like

518
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:39,909
12. This adds up like crazy. All right. Charge up. I'm going to go talk to dad. Remember, you

519
02:06:39,909 --> 02:06:48,380
would do that even if it gave one. Yeah, I would. Yes, I would. Because that's seven to 10 points

520
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:56,760
per cleanup. Do that 10 times. You've just made almost entire battery worth. 30% almost.

521
02:06:59,189 --> 02:07:04,710
What about pirate friend? Yeah, but I mean, priority right now is give the give the letter

522
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:23,029
to dad. We're doing main storyline quest here. That's one of my favorite noises. He's being

523
02:07:23,029 --> 02:07:32,840
frugal. Yeah, come on. This is how I get my points. I level up. Two, four, six, eight, 10,

524
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:41,189
12 foot. Like I just did a whole side mission. Like picking up dog hair. You have to read the

525
02:07:41,189 --> 02:07:56,010
letter first. Why? This letter contains some bad news. Are these papers? Are these like divorce

526
02:07:56,010 --> 02:08:22,300
papers? No, they're not. Is this game going to go full dark? How'd it go? What'd she say?

527
02:08:24,979 --> 02:08:33,399
Uh, I mean, this is the chaos route. Release the scurvy splinter and everyone has to like,

528
02:08:33,399 --> 02:08:51,260
oh, everyone get out. And then, hey, is that what I think it is? It is, isn't it? A love letter.

529
02:08:51,260 --> 02:09:02,739
Say it is. Thanks little buddy. Uh, the heart is in half. Oh man, this dude's truly clueless.

530
02:09:08,409 --> 02:09:17,930
I think I'll read this love letter out loud. And then the little girl. Dear dysfunctional

531
02:09:17,930 --> 02:09:29,210
family. Tao tracks mud all over the house. Jenny thinks she's a frog. And the man of the house

532
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:42,680
isn't man enough to find another job. Well, I've had enough. I'm sorry, but you've pushed me to the

533
02:09:42,680 --> 02:10:00,500
edge. The only option I've got left is divorce. Divorce. Ribbit. No.

534
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:15,130
No. I got no time to lose. I gotta cook, clean the house, and fix stuff. I have to win her back.

535
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:25,189
Let's go, Jenny. Come on, Tao. Hurry. Down the stairs. She's huge. She's huge.

536
02:10:32,039 --> 02:10:55,880
Arf. Oh my god. She's, she's huge. She grew. She's as big as dad. What? Okay. Um, congratulations.

537
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:16,840
She's like 26. What? No. I've never seen him in the same room before. That's the first I've ever

538
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:28,439
seen him in the same room. No, but wasn't she kneeling on the ground? Wait, what? How have I

539
02:11:28,439 --> 02:11:48,380
not figured this out? She's like six feet tall. She's still like two years old. Jenny's in her

540
02:11:48,460 --> 02:12:26,170
thirties. All right, let's go. Uh, let's go down and see what they're doing. To the kitchen. Yes,

541
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:45,939
to the kitchen. Yes. Yes. Yes. I got, I just got a bridge for the kitchen, right? Yes. To the base.

542
02:12:45,939 --> 02:12:54,600
Hold on. Go see mom. I know, one thing at a time. I want to see what they're doing. I got a bridge.

543
02:12:54,600 --> 02:13:07,220
I got a bridge in the kitchen. I got to bring back the guy's pirate ship. All right. Hold on.

544
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:11,619
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me talk to mom first. I mean, I'm right here.

545
02:13:11,619 --> 02:13:58,170
Might as well. Where's it? There it is. Climb. Blow. Wait, I don't know why I just thought I

546
02:13:58,170 --> 02:14:12,180
could just open the door. I'm an idiot. All right, let's go. How much power does a teleporter cost?

547
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:24,340
A lot. I can't believe I got timed out for typing this TP noise.

548
02:14:33,930 --> 02:15:13,399
And is it not like this? Well, how many times did you write it? Not enough. Jesus. Dog tracks

549
02:15:13,399 --> 02:15:22,170
mud in the house as mom tracks huge prints behind a locked door. You know what? Yeah. How

550
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:42,069
did these get here? That's bullshit. Hmm. Yes. It's happened seven times. I still don't know who's

551
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:56,630
throwing those at. I don't know why they're doing. Okay. Mom, let's talk. Let's see. Delivered my

552
02:15:56,630 --> 02:16:10,739
letter. Oh, look at you. Ah, I'm dressed like this. I'm going to. I've been picking up garbage

553
02:16:10,819 --> 02:16:21,380
around the house. 10 happy points. That's as much as I get more cleaning up three footprints.

554
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:40,329
Just saying. That's a bonus for cleaning up those footprints. Yes, I delivered the letter.

555
02:16:40,329 --> 02:16:45,399
I think you deserve a reward for being just the smartest little robot ever.

556
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:57,209
Holy shit. That is a big one. 120 points. I never thought boycotting all my housework would be this

557
02:16:57,209 --> 02:17:06,579
boring. I wish there was something I could do. Wait, I know. I haven't sewn for ages. I think

558
02:17:06,579 --> 02:17:10,979
I'll get out of the old sewing kit for a change. Since you've been working so hard and have been

559
02:17:10,979 --> 02:17:17,059
such a good bot, I'll make something nice and cozy just for you. Ooh. Give me a little time.

560
02:17:17,059 --> 02:17:48,709
Okay. All right. Mom, what's the code for the briefcase? 666. Just a minute, Chibo.

561
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:53,559
Being so tiny must make things awfully hard for you. Let me give you a hand.

562
02:17:55,610 --> 02:18:01,590
Here you go. I know you're small, but you do your best. Oh, thanks. You just saved me some time.

563
02:18:02,149 --> 02:18:20,870
Very nice of you, mom. All right. Now we're going to go down to the basement and then back. No,

564
02:18:20,870 --> 02:18:54,059
we're not. Get off me. All right. Do we have enough? Oh, not enough. We're good. All right.

565
02:18:54,059 --> 02:19:09,079
Back downstairs. Wait. I see a stain that I haven't gotten. Two of them actually. Okay. Wait. A little

566
02:19:09,079 --> 02:19:14,520
bit more over here. Yep. I think that's just artifacting. No, these are scuff marks.

567
02:19:15,319 --> 02:19:25,319
Probably from dad. Scuff marks are worth four points. Scuff marks on a carpet.

568
02:19:37,639 --> 02:19:49,959
Scuffed stream. It's from the car peeling out. Got a cleaning bonus. I think I'm pretty close

569
02:19:49,959 --> 02:20:24,860
to another rank up, right? Look at all this dirt. I just can't have this. Ah! Wait, hold on.

570
02:20:30,059 --> 02:20:39,770
It's your mom. I can't clean on surfaces. Why can I not clean these? I can't scrub on surfaces in

571
02:20:39,770 --> 02:20:47,540
front of me. Only on the ground. I missed one. No, I didn't. I know. I'm going over here.

572
02:20:49,110 --> 02:21:38,180
Water? Oh. Well, I don't have water. I have nectar. Do I have enough power to do this? Yeah. He had

573
02:21:38,180 --> 02:22:07,020
to charge his eyelids. How much power does it take to wink? Oh, let's see. How many? Okay.

574
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:14,440
You get 2,000 calories in a day. Just sitting here breathing is about... Let's see. Oh, let's pause

575
02:22:14,440 --> 02:22:22,840
for a second. Oh, I'm actually curious about this. So how many calories do you burn blinking?

576
02:22:27,030 --> 02:22:41,860
Do you burn calories when you blink? Okay. Do you lose weight when you blink? What?

577
02:22:43,590 --> 02:22:52,149
How many calories do you burn when you fart? A popular internet claim from 2015 said that

578
02:22:52,149 --> 02:22:59,350
one fart burned 67 calories and that farting 52 times a day would burn a pound of fat.

579
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:17,899
What a bunch of bullshit. Okay, so if you blink... All right, so by doing nothing...

580
02:23:23,930 --> 02:23:33,459
So it's probably like two tenths of a calorie to blink. So two tenths of one

581
02:23:33,459 --> 02:23:58,260
calorie kilowatt. Don't get banned by doing that noise. 60 calories. So you're telling me

582
02:23:58,260 --> 02:24:02,739
that if you go on like... Oh no, this is going to be gross, but we're talking. This is real life.

583
02:24:03,959 --> 02:24:11,659
If you go on like a farting spree over the course of like an hour, it's going to burn

584
02:24:11,659 --> 02:24:18,549
like a thousand calories? Who the fuck wrote that? All right, I want to go in the kitchen.

585
02:24:18,549 --> 02:24:46,860
I want to see the bridge. I want to see what they're doing. Uh-oh, small spiders. He starved

586
02:24:46,860 --> 02:25:08,139
to death because he farted too many times in a row. That's so disgusting. Gross. Just, just gross.

587
02:25:09,739 --> 02:25:38,659
Come on, I don't want any more random Pokemon battles. I've got cleaning to do. Where's the

588
02:25:38,659 --> 02:26:04,389
family? Why is nobody to be found? Holy shit, look at all this dirt. I imagine somebody opening the

589
02:26:04,389 --> 02:26:09,979
chat because they like Chibi-Robo. The first time they're here and they look at this fucking chat

590
02:26:09,979 --> 02:26:14,379
room and they see fart redeemed. Actual fart. Fart redeemed. Fart redeemed. It would just be like...

591
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:19,719
Like you just, you just pop the chat out and minimize it at that point, I think.

592
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:46,680
So you don't have it. We just close the tab. A good bonus. Can I buy the car? Yeah, and I haven't been

593
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:52,180
able to use it. I own the car and I can't even use it. I don't know what to do with it.

594
02:26:54,780 --> 02:27:01,670
Take the ghost costume off. Take the... Got you. Sorry, I had to do that one more time before I

595
02:27:02,229 --> 02:27:16,870
took it off. So much to do. Look at this. So much dirt on the ground. Oh yeah, there's another

596
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:31,219
training regimen with the eggs, right? Yeah, I go back there after I do the boat. 39 more points.

597
02:27:31,219 --> 02:28:21,879
I'm raking it in. All right, let's go to the ship. How many side quests? The bridge. Where's the

598
02:28:21,879 --> 02:28:27,930
bridge? Yeah, I don't have enough time. I have enough time to do the bridge. Wait, wait, wait.

599
02:28:27,930 --> 02:28:35,020
All right, all right, all right. Look at all this dirt. No, fuck the dirt. Forget it. Oh, it's so

600
02:28:35,020 --> 02:28:52,260
easy. No, it's not. I want to do the bridge. Think about how much dirt. I haven't done it in so long.

601
02:28:52,260 --> 02:29:02,459
Think about how much junk is up in the, uh, in the fan. Let me check the bridge out because I've

602
02:29:02,459 --> 02:29:11,370
invested a lot of money into making the kitchen traversable. Where's the bridge? Right there.

603
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:15,579
Okay. I'm gonna run out of time, but I still want to see it. What about the flowers? I haven't

604
02:29:15,579 --> 02:29:30,809
checked down those either. Oh, look, they're little sprouts. It's a bud, chibi robo. Wow.

605
02:29:34,739 --> 02:29:39,690
All right, turn it on. Do you want to know how to use the bridge utility bot?

606
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:47,479
Insert your plug to unfold the bridge, and you want to shorten it, just tilt down.

607
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:54,360
Change the bridge's direction, plug in the side. Push or pull the utility bot freely,

608
02:29:54,360 --> 02:30:00,040
so try moving the utility bot to a different location. All right, what do I want to go from

609
02:30:00,040 --> 02:30:43,430
here? Ah, that way. Ooh. Ooh. Oh my goodness. What have you done? It really is. Or it's...

610
02:30:44,950 --> 02:31:04,620
I thought the bridge was complete, and it wasn't. This is a stranding type game. Death stranding.

611
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:15,350
This is a stranding. All right, this is happening way more frequently. It's happened nine times in

612
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:23,420
10 hours of gameplay. It's happened like four times in the last one hour. Why is it happening

613
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:40,219
in more frequency? No, whatever. I can... I'll come back. There's not enough time in the day

614
02:31:41,100 --> 02:32:08,729
to do anything. I'm definitely like eight or seven. The seventh best robo? Eight. Making

615
02:32:08,729 --> 02:32:25,430
into the top eight. More power. That's a lot. That's a huge increase. 230. That's huge.

616
02:32:30,620 --> 02:32:36,329
Oh, chibi robo is a new product available for the online store.

617
02:32:37,290 --> 02:32:40,889
Let's see here. Ah, there. It's some new chibi gear. They call it chibi radar.

618
02:32:41,690 --> 02:32:45,319
With one of those, you'd be able to find things not visible to the naked eye.

619
02:32:46,840 --> 02:32:49,079
You have to buy it and see if it's true. Okay, yeah. Let's go.

620
02:32:51,239 --> 02:33:23,340
Well, it depends on how much it is. Okay, seeds. Chibi radar. I can't afford it.

621
02:33:24,059 --> 02:33:29,020
Let you see things that are hidden from normal view. Okay, I'll buy that next.

622
02:33:30,059 --> 02:33:44,409
I have enough to do this. Living room bridge. Yeah, I can do this. Let's do it. Does Jerma ever

623
02:33:44,409 --> 02:33:59,700
scream? Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes. Maybe like once. It's a utility bot. Where's this going on

624
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:15,860
the bookcase? Set it out in the living room. All right. I want to go to the basement, too.

625
02:34:16,739 --> 02:34:28,260
But we just... Okay, where is it? Because there's other stuff in here that I didn't get.

626
02:34:29,379 --> 02:34:55,510
Frog ring up there. Where is it? I gotta get higher. Where's this bridge? Top of the TV,

627
02:34:55,510 --> 02:35:06,760
you know? Oh, it's over there. But I can't... Can I get up there yet? I think I can, right?

628
02:35:07,719 --> 02:35:38,889
Hold on. Let me push this back. Ah, a Joop classic. Nice. All right. Can this go any higher?

629
02:35:45,909 --> 02:35:56,299
No, it can't. It's pronounced jump. Can you imagine going into a stream and correcting

630
02:35:56,299 --> 02:36:02,219
somebody on their own thing that they created? Can you imagine the scenario where you do that?

631
02:36:03,260 --> 02:36:18,420
What's the scenario where you do that? When you look through a telescope and you see the beautiful,

632
02:36:18,420 --> 02:36:26,739
big, beautiful, huge planet known as Juppiter. Yeah. Juppiter. It's the biggest planet we have

633
02:36:26,739 --> 02:36:43,719
in our solar system. It's huge. All right. Oh, I can get this. No, stop picking up the cord.

634
02:36:43,719 --> 02:36:59,420
I wish there was a way I could make it so I don't pick the cord up. Let's get that frog ring more.

635
02:36:59,420 --> 02:37:13,819
Okay. I was wondering how to get this for the longest time, and now we got it.

636
02:37:14,620 --> 02:37:46,069
Well, now I know how to get over there. Slow, slow, slow. All right. Now we just drop down to

637
02:37:46,069 --> 02:38:16,969
here. Nice. Demon door. Okay. And I can climb on that too? Let's do this first. Good chunk of

638
02:38:16,969 --> 02:38:29,379
change. It's going to bring me to the ceiling? Oh, man. We're up pretty high. All right. Hold on.

639
02:38:30,260 --> 02:38:42,420
This is... I'm all the way to the top. Okay. What's up here? I could go this way and go over there.

640
02:38:43,879 --> 02:38:52,649
Or what do I want to do up here? Is there anything that's super high up that I haven't gotten? I

641
02:38:52,649 --> 02:39:10,549
guess over there. And here. All right. Let's just walk around. I don't fall, right? Okay. As long

642
02:39:10,549 --> 02:39:20,059
as I'm careful. Can I go in here? Fall and float into this? But is there anything even over there?

643
02:39:20,059 --> 02:39:36,360
There's nothing even there. I don't think there's any reason to do that. All right. There's a space

644
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:51,500
over this way. What is this? This is a weird spot. Oh! Right there. Okay. I can fall from there and

645
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:58,010
float into the demon door. I could also... Yeah. That's... And then I got everything.

646
02:39:58,729 --> 02:40:05,930
I've not missed one thing in this room at that point. All right. Let's keep the walk. I'm gonna...

647
02:40:05,930 --> 02:40:13,239
No, I don't want to take the drop door out. Is the demon door under me? Oh, wait. Isn't

648
02:40:13,239 --> 02:40:23,829
the one like... There's one right... Did I get this one? I got this one already! Wow. I knew I got

649
02:40:23,829 --> 02:40:28,620
this one already. I knew I got this one already. Oh, I got it already. I knew it. I was like,

650
02:40:29,180 --> 02:40:51,620
Oh, baited. It's all right. I can get right back up there. I knew it too. I knew it. All right. Charge

651
02:40:51,620 --> 02:41:45,690
up. No save. What happens at a hundred charges? The battery explodes. Same deal. Climb and then

652
02:41:45,690 --> 02:42:10,520
run along the wall and get the secret demon door. Camera. Float. All right. Wait. Maybe something

653
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:19,110
behind the picture of... Maybe there was... I don't know. Maybe it's something behind there.

654
02:42:19,750 --> 02:42:37,500
What's the fastest way? Get to... I think they're both equally slow. We got to get over there.

655
02:42:38,059 --> 02:42:49,799
We're just gonna have to run this way. All right. Let's go. All the way in the whole wall.

656
02:42:51,610 --> 02:43:21,579
Just run. Yep. Where is it? No. Where is it? It's underneath. It's like right here, right?

657
02:43:31,350 --> 02:43:47,909
Okay. Isn't it right here? It's right here, isn't it? Where is this thing?

658
02:43:48,549 --> 02:44:07,940
Did I pass it? No, it's right there. It's right there. Okay. I just got to get on top of this

659
02:44:10,309 --> 02:44:31,049
and then float into here. Aha! This is the last door that's in here. I think, right? I can check

660
02:44:31,049 --> 02:44:47,049
the... Let me see. Eight out of nine. Who is the ninth one? There's one more. Eight out of nine.

661
02:44:47,049 --> 02:44:51,819
It's probably hidden somewhere. It's probably hidden. Yeah. I probably need that device.

662
02:44:51,819 --> 02:45:01,860
All right. Let's go. All right. What's next on the list? We're going to

663
02:45:03,620 --> 02:45:14,069
the basement. The basement is into the foyer and then basement. Actually, I want to do the... Yeah.

664
02:45:14,069 --> 02:45:20,420
Let's go this way. I want to do this first. German, did you read this important message? I didn't.

665
02:45:21,239 --> 02:45:30,969
It was very important. I'm so glad that you brought it to my attention. All right. Let's

666
02:45:30,969 --> 02:45:51,319
go talk to the beans or the eggs, whatever they are. Private Vegas reporting with duty. Uh-huh.

667
02:45:51,959 --> 02:45:58,299
Sarge has been a tough egg to crack lately. All I want to do is race cars.

668
02:45:59,100 --> 02:46:04,940
Maybe I'll drive away and go AWOL. Tag me when German lies. What the fuck is going on here?

669
02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:17,670
What did I lie about? What are you doing? What was my lie? I didn't lie. Tell me the lie. What was

670
02:46:17,670 --> 02:46:33,450
the lie? Let me know when you want this to stop. Yeah. There was nothing there. He didn't like the

671
02:46:33,450 --> 02:46:46,250
message. A lot about Rain World. All right. Enough with the Rain World. Can we move on

672
02:46:46,250 --> 02:47:02,950
from Rain World? It's a fun game. All right. Where's the captain? I want to do this mission,

673
02:47:02,950 --> 02:47:17,610
whatever it is. Come back to it in like a month or two. All right. Here come the timeouts.

674
02:47:18,250 --> 02:47:24,760
I cannot guarantee you will not be timed out if you continue to spam that.

675
02:47:29,420 --> 02:47:39,590
Uh-oh. MonkaW. What is MonkaW? All right. Basement. Basement. Let's go get this guy's ship back.

676
02:47:39,590 --> 02:48:05,530
Enable it and find out. No. I don't need to. What are the music? Please do. It's better. Isn't it

677
02:48:05,530 --> 02:48:23,979
just... Okay. It's GermaFear and GermaMars, right? That's what it is. Oh, we just had a shitload of

678
02:48:23,979 --> 02:48:38,069
subs coming. That's a lot of subs. GermaSucks gave 50 community subs. Thank you, GermaSucks.

679
02:48:39,719 --> 02:48:48,440
That's a heavy, heavy full bag of community subscriptions. You just dumped it in front of

680
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:55,540
everybody. Thanks a lot. It's a lot of money. That's a cat puke noise, especially for you.

681
02:48:56,340 --> 02:49:10,889
Thanks for the monumental amount of subscriptions. There's a new GeForce driver for your information.

682
02:49:10,889 --> 02:49:27,159
All right. Wait, why do I have to? This is going... Is it for the GameCube? Shit, I gotta update my

683
02:49:27,159 --> 02:49:34,489
GeForce GameCube driver. Okay, what was actually in the Wii? It was ATI, wasn't it? Yeah, the Wii

684
02:49:34,489 --> 02:49:55,739
was ATI. So it was GameCube. What does everybody have now? Like for instance, what is in the Switch?

685
02:49:57,719 --> 02:50:07,110
Is it an ATI still? Is it Nvidia? What's in the Switch? What's in the Xbox One? What's in the PS4?

686
02:50:07,110 --> 02:50:13,750
Is it all in video? Does anybody have ATI anymore? All right. Okay. Let's talk to this guy and give

687
02:50:13,750 --> 02:50:27,799
him his... Hold on. Xbox is AMD. Yes, for an Xbox are AMD. I'm pretty sure.

688
02:50:33,139 --> 02:50:40,840
It's good to see you. It's been long and long, hasn't it? So you've come to hear this old salt

689
02:50:40,840 --> 02:50:54,260
tale, have you? No, but I'm sure. All right, sit you back and get ready for a whale of a tale.

690
02:50:54,260 --> 02:51:04,440
Hold on. I'm here to keep my promise too. Ahoy there, squid bait. You're looking ship shaped today.

691
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:12,010
Squid bait? Squid bait! Hi squid bait. Now simmer down. What I'm about to tell you

692
02:51:12,010 --> 02:51:36,280
happened many years ago when Twirl was young. I've got a loading screen for this. A big coin.

693
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:43,159
That fateful day I found a doubloon gleaming like a wee lassie's eyes.

694
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:54,659
And the salty scourge of the seas that I was. I decided to seize this shiny treasure from

695
02:51:54,659 --> 02:52:04,260
myself. Oh, what a pretty treasure it was. However, the Sandersons were so poor he could

696
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:12,860
hear their bellies rumbling like thunder. Giga-Robo blamed himself for their troubles.

697
02:52:13,420 --> 02:52:22,979
Aye, he did. Every pirate swears to be as evil as a barnacle in bed. It be our code.

698
02:52:26,120 --> 02:52:34,649
But I couldn't even steal one measly doubloon. Ah, a foul humiliation it was. As ye know pirates

699
02:52:34,649 --> 02:52:40,170
who aren't evil end up at theme parks. It be terrifying. That's pretty funny.

700
02:52:42,010 --> 02:52:52,309
I hid me ship and confined myself in the briny dark basement. Your the Sanders be out of moolah

701
02:52:52,309 --> 02:53:11,610
and can't be buying food. I'm betting they be dead. Wait, like now? They're dead? Huh? Actually,

702
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:16,889
the Sanderson family is doing just fine. They may not be rich but they were at least able to buy us.

703
02:53:17,850 --> 02:53:21,129
And were not exactly bargain basement items if I do say so myself.

704
02:53:26,729 --> 02:53:37,420
What's that ye be saying? So they'd not have been troubled if I'd claimed the moolah I foundish me

705
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:42,739
on? I heard that Mr. Sanderson hasn't been working and finances are kind of tight.

706
02:53:43,459 --> 02:53:45,750
But if it's just a little it's not a problem.

707
02:53:49,850 --> 02:53:57,590
You know what this means. I'm no longer bound to this dank backwater. This treasure in this house

708
02:53:58,149 --> 02:54:13,829
that is and I means to find it. What's the main sale me hearties? Main sale? Oh right it's I have

709
02:54:13,829 --> 02:54:23,799
it. I have to give it to you. Don't you need a ship first? Shiver me timbers I forgot I've got

710
02:54:23,799 --> 02:54:33,610
no ship. This is the quest we just got put on and I have it already. I put me ship in a dry dock so

711
02:54:33,610 --> 02:54:42,950
as to keep her safe but me head's full of fog and me ship's lost. You're me only hope chibi I want

712
02:54:42,950 --> 02:54:55,340
you to find me ship and bring her home. I've got a surprise for you. Stop ad-living. What? I'm going

713
02:54:55,340 --> 02:55:05,129
off script. Who cares? What? I'm going off script for a few words like any real actor does. You know

714
02:55:05,129 --> 02:55:09,209
how many lines you've heard in movies that were not scripted turned out to be the most classic

715
02:55:09,209 --> 02:55:14,950
things you've heard on screen? A pirate in need is a pirate who gets what he wants.

716
02:55:17,780 --> 02:55:24,709
That's the pirate's code you see. Doesn't seem right somehow. Hmm don't think so eh?

717
02:55:25,430 --> 02:55:37,020
You fancy yourself a great thinker don't you? You fly and bucket a bitch. If you're half as keen

718
02:55:37,020 --> 02:55:43,180
as you think you'll keep your blowhole shut. Pirates are not accustomed to waiting now go

719
02:55:43,180 --> 02:55:57,299
find me ship. Yes yes sir uh captain captain sir. Let's go look for the ship chibi. We'll go

720
02:55:57,299 --> 02:56:02,219
ahead and scout around but now that he's gone let me just talk about how I wish I just don't

721
02:56:02,219 --> 02:56:06,780
want him fucking following me around anymore. I have your ship but I don't want to tell him.

722
02:56:06,780 --> 02:56:15,139
I'm just gonna let him go do that for a while. You want to let go hang out? What's that chibi?

723
02:56:15,139 --> 02:56:41,690
Have you found me long lost ship already? I have the scurvy splinter. It's so big. Yeah it is.

724
02:56:42,649 --> 02:56:49,340
Aha so I'm assuming we can fly around in this thing.

725
02:56:54,500 --> 02:57:02,889
Yes it'd be mine ye floating kelp cube. That's me scurvy splinter. Me ship you've earned me thanks.

726
02:57:02,889 --> 02:57:08,629
It's gonna be a lot of happy points. Captain Plankbeard just gave you 66 happy points.

727
02:57:13,739 --> 02:57:19,860
Spread the happiness. There's treasure awaiting and me thinks I'll be getting me some.

728
02:57:24,120 --> 02:57:25,959
All right so have we completed his quest line?

729
02:57:29,540 --> 02:57:40,139
It says there's treasure awaiting. Anchors away me hearties. Probably needs power.

730
02:57:41,260 --> 02:57:46,120
We have to have a new battery charge for grandpa's fucking rowboat.

731
02:57:50,139 --> 02:57:53,260
Barnacles and bilge pumps. I've got no blasted crew.

732
02:57:53,899 --> 02:58:09,430
Oh hi then there's only one thing to do. I need you to find me some brave lads who yearn for a

733
02:58:09,430 --> 02:58:23,260
life of swashbuckling adventure. If you find me four men brave and true I'll have no choice but

734
02:58:23,260 --> 02:58:29,159
to give you me treasure map. Got it. One pirate crew coming up. Get the eggs would probably do

735
02:58:29,159 --> 02:58:36,180
it right. Need four crewmen. Courage me lads. Courage. Probably the dinosaur.

736
02:58:37,219 --> 02:58:54,860
One of the eggs. The dinosaur. What about you? It's probably yeah it's definitely the eggs.

737
02:58:54,860 --> 02:59:22,969
I am. Here we go. Okay so the next order of business. It's gonna be a new day.

738
02:59:23,850 --> 02:59:29,370
We gotta go check out where's the family. We gotta go check up on what the family's doing.

739
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:41,430
Valley the princess. We gotta go climb the tower. Right right right. Yeah that's true.

740
02:59:42,389 --> 02:59:47,129
All right we have the tower with the shoe. We have the family doing whatever the hell the family's

741
02:59:47,129 --> 02:59:56,139
doing. Wherever they are. We're doing chores. I haven't seen them in any of the rooms. Let's

742
02:59:56,139 --> 03:00:06,659
go climb the tower. We'll do that tomorrow. Maybe I can recruit somebody up here. What does it mean

743
03:00:06,659 --> 03:00:15,819
if your computer says um it means i would turn it off and check to see if potentially one of the

744
03:00:15,819 --> 03:00:22,059
fans is spinning and hitting something in your case that's a very easy fix i would check that

745
03:00:22,059 --> 03:00:29,799
first uh if not then i would be careful with the potential messed up power supply um i wish you

746
03:00:29,799 --> 03:00:36,889
got to be careful with that though electricity don't fuck with electricity go check you want

747
03:00:36,969 --> 03:00:45,319
to begin jungle training um do i have enough time for this no it could be an ssd dying

748
03:00:45,319 --> 03:01:05,239
yep a quiet time with television what do you do if your computer is just a pile of rocks

749
03:01:06,440 --> 03:01:11,000
um somebody has convinced you that your computer is a pile of rocks but behind the big rock

750
03:01:11,639 --> 03:01:16,360
there's a small probably form factor pc that's behind it plugged into the wall and then plugged

751
03:01:16,360 --> 03:01:21,479
into a monitor so somebody's been lying to you for a long time i don't know what your situation

752
03:01:21,479 --> 03:01:36,260
is wherever you are still rank eight check the seasoning and the garlic salt may have dried up

753
03:01:40,340 --> 03:01:43,459
maybe the rock is the case now that's actually kind of cool

754
03:01:45,049 --> 03:01:48,649
carve out of this in the middle of a rock and have your components in there

755
03:01:52,200 --> 03:02:00,629
i think that would be pretty bad for heat conduction flintstone case how is that cool

756
03:02:01,350 --> 03:02:08,309
i don't know people dunk their motherboards in oil in a like a fish tank without any fish in it

757
03:02:08,870 --> 03:02:17,700
people do all kinds of weird shit with their computer setups i think i'm gonna buy

758
03:02:18,579 --> 03:02:30,389
wait do i have enough i do bedroom bridge bedroom basement warp works here from place to place

759

763
03:03:48,649 --> 03:03:58,299
let's test it see how it works gb radar um how does it work

764
03:04:01,420 --> 03:04:12,040

778
03:07:54,329 --> 03:07:58,409
this i'm gonna pause it so there's no movement on the screen here ready i'll this is how you

779
03:07:58,409 --> 03:08:11,510
this is how you work with this scenario so black screen requires no rendering stop all movement on

780
03:08:11,510 --> 03:08:34,409
screen stop playing halo well hmm i'm at 1000k up right now oh this is bad we're going even lower

781
03:08:37,819 --> 03:08:46,280
uh my voice is taking up all the bit rate well we'll see let's give this a minute or two a

782
03:08:46,280 --> 03:08:55,190
wink right now bad time for a wink this is this is going to be a low quality wink i like forgot

783
03:08:55,190 --> 03:09:02,469
how to do it all right you know i'm gonna i'm gonna go brp for a minute let's go check on some

786
03:11:47,219 --> 03:12:00,950
let's give it some more frame data i think we're okay right a little that's kind of a major

787
03:12:01,989 --> 03:12:12,500
let's hope that doesn't happen again because that just like kind of killed the stream for like

788
03:12:13,299 --> 03:12:20,309
oh five minutes but let's keep going i got i'm monitoring it over here let's see if it happens

789
03:12:20,309 --> 03:12:32,860
again we'll have to figure it out right all right let's go what was i doing you're muted what i'm

790
03:12:32,860 --> 03:12:40,120
not actually i'm gonna put this in a different spot on my computer so i can really view it all

791
03:12:40,120 --> 03:13:00,389
right let's get it yeah we're fine i just ran into something some kind of weird traffic problem
