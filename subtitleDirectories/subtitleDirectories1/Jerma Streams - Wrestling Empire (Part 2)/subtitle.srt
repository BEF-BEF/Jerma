1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,379
What's up? Oh, I thought I was ready to talk wasn't apparently apparently wasn't ready to talk

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:19,219
I best I guess not and I have to say let me let me re situate myself here. Let me put my seat down

3
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:23,030
Uh, let me put my seat up. Actually. I don't like that move this

4
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,170
I see it here. There we go. That's better

5
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:28,250
Uh, so I have to say

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,550
This is the first time for everything

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,549
And for the first time ever

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,210
ever

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,009
Since I started streaming regularly, I that's the hardest word to say in the english language, by the way

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,859
Regularly since I started streaming regularly

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,780
This is the first time i've ever streamed

12
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,939
on the first

13
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:55,460
Of multiple days that I tell you a stream could happen

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,240
Think about that. That's it. This is a huge milestone for us

15
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,069
Let's say I stream on sunday and I go. Oh, hey guys, you know what the next stream?

16
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:12,310
Maybe tuesday or tuesday or wednesday. I bet it's probably tuesday, but maybe wednesday tuesday or wednesday

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,030
It's never happened on the tuesday

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,230
It's always the last day of the range that I give you

19
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:26,019
And now for the first time ever it's it's the first one. It's the it's the first one and i'm early

20
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:33,780
No, i'm actually like 40 minutes over what I told you I was thinking about but look

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,620
You all know that what you do you thought the stream is gonna happen tomorrow

22
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:43,370
So like holy shit, he's streaming today. Oh nice first time ever. Oh, he's an hour late, but he does that shit every day

23
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,370
Anyways, right that you already know that

24
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,519
Hold on give me one second. I want to rearrange my desk and I don't want it to be loud

25
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,349
Show us the boy show us the boy

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,449
Yo, I will

27
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,810
I promise there will be at least one auto appearance before the stream ends

28
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:28,099
Not right now though. He's sleeping over here. He just came in and he's resting

29
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,169
He's buried his head. Whoa, that was gonna be a huge burp if I didn't have extreme skill to suppress that

30
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:42,949
He's on he buried his head under the covers and he's sleeping i'm not gonna wake him up for content

31
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,030
He can stay asleep when he's ready

32
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,169
And he's ready to view

33
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,250
We'll see him

34
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,050
Stop burping and talk look how many times you burp a day

35
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,860
You burp probably like six or seven hundred times a day

36
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,129
It's I think it's a little less than that. Still. It's like it's a lot

37
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,490
It's like probably like at least 50 or like 30

38
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,560
You okay?

39
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
You never burp. Yeah, right

40
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
You're the same person that says

41
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,740
Yeah, I I mean I i've fart sometimes but like not really like sometimes if I have like a big meal or

42
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:40,500
No, you're the you're the guy that like goes and hides downstairs turns the bathroom fan on turns the sink on

43
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:47,080
and farts

44
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,319
So I I got you. I know who you are

45
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:02,539
You're a hider or you're like you you're the other kind of person though. Correct me if i'm wrong here

46
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,479
Or you will go pretend to have a cigarette

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,560
to make sure

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
That like you don't have to fart around people

49
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,789
Yeah, i'll be right back. Just gonna go have a smoke real quick. I didn't know you were a smoker. Yes

50
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,790
Shitty fucking habit. Whatever and you go out there and just rip ass outside

51
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,069
And then you come back and you you don't want people to know that you're doing that

52
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:27,000
You'd rather have people think you were smoking cigarettes

53
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,829
And like fart in their presence

54
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,579
Because that's me like that. I'm describing me

55
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,519
If we were in a big like area big crowded place and I had nowhere to go

56
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,899
And I had to like I had to rip ass really really badly

57
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,300
I would rather pretend that the group of people know I smoked cigarettes than like fart in their presence

58
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:59,589
And I know there's a lot of you like me

59
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:02,819
Or go take like a phone call

60
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,699
All right, fuck. I I I lean my head over and go

61
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,290
I got a call. I think it's my mother

62
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:24,629
I'll walk outside. I haven't all right enough stalling. Let's go

63
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:27,829
We're going to continue. Mr. Satan's wrestling empire

64
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:34,759
If you didn't catch the stream yesterday

65
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,250
Off to a great start during my nice. I'd like to hear that

66
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,829
If you didn't get straight yesterday wrestling empire, it's fucking one of the best games

67
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:48,629
I played in the last couple of years. I guarantee that's not a joke

68
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,089
I do want to make something really clear

69
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,819
You know time it is you have any idea what time it is?

70
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:09,779
it's

71
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,060
This time

72
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:17,189
Because here's the game

73
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:29,290
Mr satan continues what how much money do I make three dollars a week? That's what I wanted

74
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,930
That's what I wanted it to start and I fucked it all up

75
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,329
I thought that was the beginning of the song but it was the end of the song

76
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:40,009
Whatever

77
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,050
You get the idea

78
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,529
And you know the more like I hit the more that I listen to this song

79
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,589
So i've heard it like 60 or 70 times in the last 24 hours

80
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,819
I like the song. This is a good song

81
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,910
I want to put this on like a playlist now. This song is fucking pretty. This is an awesome song

82
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,310
All right, let's go

83
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,709
Uh, I had nothing scheduled today so we can

84
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,189
What do I need to do am I under any contractual obligations to do anything

85
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:22,759
No, right

86
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,399
No contract bullshit that I have to do by a certain date

87
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,970
My agility sucks. Should I do agility?

88
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:37,430
Look in the top right

89
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,430
Oh, no. Okay. Good. Good. Good. That's good to know

90
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:47,339
I'm gonna do agility because I feel like it's gonna be like get your agility to 80 more strength. Um, yeah

91
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,569
I lost skill. I lost skill. That's bad

92
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:57,160
I got a day off. It's fine. All right

93
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,540
Today's the day of rest

94
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,420
No creative control is bad. I know I completely fucked over everything but whatever I look I could just

95
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,060
I can just beat the boss up until I get to leave

96
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,790
You don't keep mr. Satan under a contract if he doesn't want to be on it. All right

97
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:20,579
I thought that was the joker

98
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,339
So I think that's supposed to be donk the clown

99
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:30,949
Okay

100
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:33,830
In nine weeks, you might be able to renegotiate. All right, let's we'll do that then

101
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:39,500
Also, by the way, if you didn't see yesterday's stream

102
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,779
You're in for a real fucking treat because this is seriously i'm not i'm almost swearing for no reason, right?

103
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,860
There was no reason me to say the f-word there

104
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,539
Like I just deliberately put the f-word in there. I don't know why like I was like, oh, yeah, it's gonna sound cool

105
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,379
No, i'm not gonna do that anymore

106
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:00,500
Okay. I think this is the charity

107
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,940
event

108
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,669
right

109
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:08,549
This is for charity for something. What was that?

110
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,860
He just like hit his head on the sign

111
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:20,070
What's that sound?

112
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,070
vulture with thomas son

113
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,169
and mr. Satan

114
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,169
with motorola champ

115
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,039
I can't walk. There we go

116
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,539
Is this for what's this for?

117
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:50,730
And this is my oh

118
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,279
Did you come up with a weight?

119
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,240
Ultra die out here much more than just another wrestler left

120
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,899
Ow

121
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:08,980
This is a special charity event that would raise money for good causes around the world were they mad that I was turned around

122
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,919
Those attendants have already donated bit by bit showing up. So give yourselves a big round of applause. Get away from me put that down

123
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,090
And we hope you'll be joined by many more watching at home who can also pledge their donation

124
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:25,240
Is this a hardcore match?

125
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,519
Enough talking vulture. Let's give the world what they want. Let me guess a big match for a big donation

126
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,750
Wait, why does the ref have a bomb?

127
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,019
All right, let's go

128
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,019
The map why is it on fire?

129
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,799
Holy shit. Oh, I got him with it. I got him. I got him

130
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,750
So this is just a singles match for charity. All right. Well that was

131
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,049
I'm fine. All right. How much help do I have? All right, let's kick this guy's ass

132
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,470
It's funny every time i'm sorry

133
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,190
It's one of those games where it's funny every fucking time

134
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:39,529
Can I just count them out? All right, let's do some wrestling

135
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,820
Why did the ref have a bomb? I don't I don't that's the part. I don't understand

136
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,070
Did he throw that into the audience?

137
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:57,340
I love how unhinged the referees are as well as the players. All right

138
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
typically you want your referee to be somebody that's

139
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,139
collected calm

140
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,620
Tries to get order holds the court. Whatever

141
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
This guy is just as fucked up as everybody else

142
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,840
Where is he going?

143
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:37,029
He's not paying attention. I got him. Oh, it's it's

144
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,350
That's another thing these guys do they just get on the top rope the people that aren't even supposed to be in here

145
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:49,399
Like get the fuck out of here

146
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,279
You fucking little worm

147
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:13,240
All right, i'm gonna drop this guy in his head big ddt grab him by his jowls and shake him

148
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,580
All right, it's time let's go this is it that's a special move

149
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,460
It's over

150
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,919
I hear those crunches

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,049
Got out

152
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,009
That's the match is not over yet. Get out get out here. I didn't win yet

153
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,730
I know we both thought it was a guarantee, but it didn't happen

154
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:51,820
That's it something broke over on stage left. I don't know what it was

155
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
What broke did you hear that?

156
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:06,759
Who's this?

157
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,059
Wait, who's that lady?

158
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,059
You see this person out here. Who's this person?

159
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,820
I'm so confused

160
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:31,590
Yeah, what ellie knots? What are you doing? Who is this? He couldn't even get out of the ring

161
00:14:32,389 --> 00:15:02,779
Is a commentator I thought this was a fan. Oh my god, i'm gonna get counted out. It is a fan. Oh no, it's not oops

162
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:15,940
All right, big move to end it. Here we go. That's not what I wanted, but it's okay. That's a pin got it one

163
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:27,220
Two this guy is

164
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,740
Stop booing

165
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,299
God damn it. This is budget sting. I think

166
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,220
There's a lot of licensed kind of characters that are in the game in quotes

167
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,179
All right, I didn't want it. Where's my manager and how come he's not helping me?

168
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,970
They've renamed and sort of changed slightly a lot of people that look like characters

169
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,620
So we just saw doink the clown. I'm that's supposed to be doink the clown

170
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:19,940
Get out. Jesus. This guy's resilient

171
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:31,139
Get out free. There it is. All right

172
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,990
This guy refuses to die. Yeah, wait, here comes ellie knots

173
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,570
What do you want? What do you want? Why are you looking at me? Get away from me?

174
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:54,789
That was weird. Somebody said are you gonna kill any more friends today?

175
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:03,580
I did not kill schmo. Okay, the last match that me and schmo had I did

176
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,529
Beat him over and over again in the head with a bat and like a a garbage can lid

177
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,089
And he died two days later

178
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,170
But it said he died of natural

179
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,890
Causes it didn't say he suffered any injuries. That's not my I didn't do that

180
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:28,039
It said natural causes

181
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,910
a natural

182
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,910
bat to the head

183
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,450
The bat the bat was made out of wood. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Hold on. So you had fun out there. Mr

184
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:51,299
Satan well, you made quite a mess of the arena if you ever want to book this venue again

185
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,619
You better pay two hundred dollars towards the damages

186
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,500
What damages?

187
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,059
Oh because I threw the bomb but the ref had it in his hand. I just took it from him and threw

188
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
And look, here's the thing. I

189
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Listen, this is this is where you get weird

190
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:19,299
Legally speaking, right? So who's real whose whose fault was it referee brings bomb into the ring?

191
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:26,390
I grab bomb throw bomb guy picks bomb up on ground bomb blows up in his hand

192
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:33,779
So what happened like the referee didn't detonate it. I didn't that he picked it up and blew up in his hand

193
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,420
That's not my fault

194
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,019
Like that's like collectively we should all have to split the bill in my opinion

195
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,079
At least me and the ref the ref should the ref brought it in the ring

196
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
I'm just trying to fucking get rid of the damn thing

197
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:55,259
Referee brought it into the ring and he's just holding it. I took it out of his hand and I fucking whipped it

198
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,509
I was like get this out of here

199
00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:00,230
And then he picked it up because he wanted to use it and it blew up

200
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,839
That's I I I accept 45 percent of the bill there. Not all of it

201
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:12,539
I think the referee made out really really well and who brought it by the way

202
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:20,440
Anyone that can beat vulture deserves to be at hollywood as well

203
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:29,299
Wait one we feel you'd be a valuable addition to the cast and we'd like to make you a star with this deal

204
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:39,319
Oh shit, this is way better than my contract now. This is the guy next to me. That's the owner

205
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,059
Okay, when I sign the contract throw him out the window

206
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,779
You know what I mean? Like let's go i'll sign this right now

207
00:19:52,089 --> 00:20:00,069
Only paid for winning matches. That's fine. I win every match. This is this is a good contract

208
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:08,259
I want longer

209
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,539
I want at least 12 weeks

210
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:13,700
But that's 3400 a week. This guy's paying me

211
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,099
300 a week

212
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,299
And I I have no control over anything that I ever do

213
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:23,000
But do you think right now he's side-eyeing me?

214
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,670
It's like almost like i'm kind of I want to give him like a telepathic text

215
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,630
With my eyes saying like mother fucker

216
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:36,410
I want five grand a week when we go in the car and I decide if i'm gonna do this or not

217
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,460
I'll do 12 weeks. Let's go. Yeah, fuck this guy

218
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,069
Movie shoots don't tend to last that long. We prefer to keep this short

219
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:52,539
Oh

220
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,950
Damn it

221
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:05,990
All right. All right. All right. I'll do six weeks. Okay. All right

222
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,650
All right

223
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,490
We'll book you against vulture straight away to reignite you a few ways. This must be scripted

224
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:23,779
Listen mr. Satan a lot has changed since we first signed you to 3400 a week 30 seconds ago

225
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:30,759
A lot has changed. We all have to make sacrifices to stay afloat. So how would you feel about taking a pay cut?

226
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:38,569
Excuse me. I just we haven't even left the office yet

227
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:42,650
We have not i haven't even gone to the bathroom since I signed that contract

228
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,529
No, you know, excuse me pay me what we agreed. Fuck that

229
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,920
What?

230
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,119
If you insist on being a financial drain i'm gonna have to cut you off

231
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,779
Did I get fired what am I in?

232
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,740
I'm in wrestling school

233
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,339
What just happened?

234
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,059
Like I I what happened what?

235
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:28,980
You can't do that

236
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:31,059
Now i'm back in wrestling school

237
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,700
um

238
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,819
Okay. Now I know who my biggest enemies in the world are

239
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,829
I was part of that. Um, what was I didn't know what the name of my card was before

240
00:22:52,789 --> 00:23:01,400
They treated me like shit they paid me nothing but that guy at least fought for me. No, don't touch the bomb. That's bait

241
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Because they know that i'm gonna pay for everything

242
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,119
After I was just talking shit about it

243
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:11,460
Mr. Satan, shouldn't you be shooting a movie instead of doing something as lowly as wrestling?

244
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,259
Yeah, I would if I didn't um get like the rug pulled underneath me after I signed a contract

245
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:24,660
Stick to that nonsense because you don't belong in the ring with me. You know, that stings evidently

246
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,259
I'm a little out of touch. You're so far under my radar. You know who the hell you are

247
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:30,920
I'm like so sad. I can't even do the mr

248
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:46,869
Satan voice i'll make you famous tonight and you'll realize there is such a thing as bad publicity. Is he counting himself out?

249
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:56,490
I can't fucking believe that just happened. Did I even get any incentive payment for joining?

250
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:03,750
No, it was I left my organization joined a new one and they fired me within the first 10 seconds signing the contract

251
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,150
That's so sad

252
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:16,220
Because you didn't ask for an advance

253
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:18,730
Well, I didn't think I was gonna have to ask for an advance

254
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,390
Your contract died of natural causes that's a good one

255
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:31,589
That's actually good. That was a really good joke. I'm serious. That's perfect. I wish I said that

256
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:46,859
Okay, I keep hurting myself when I do these moves

257
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,839
Hey

258
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:10,569
It should we go off our injury on this guy take the green contract not the red one

259
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,329
All right. Let's put this guy out

260
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:27,140
Good night. See you later

261
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,779
How come there's no music?

262
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:33,339
You know, I was thinking about this last night

263
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,960
And it sort of almost adds to how funny the game is in a way

264
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:44,200
Because it's just he's just and it's also because i've been in wrestling school as a contract so there's no audience members

265
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,160
Every time I get signed within like a week something horrible happens and I lose my contract so there's no crowd noise

266
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,509
That's what you're missing right now

267
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:57,509
You're missing the like, whoa

268
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,990
But it actually kind of adds to like how awkward this is

269
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:16,250
Remember you're killing people. I've not killed anybody

270
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:27,019
Name me one person i've killed that I killed like in the ring. You know what I mean? It's nobody

271
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:45,059
Okay, that sounded bad, but I assure you he's fine. All right, give me a new contract

272
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,259
Mr. Satan has reached the limit of wrestling school's popularity

273
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:00,390
Yeah, I

274
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,549
What the I can't what am I supposed to do about this?

275
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:12,779
Can I get a contract? That's not a piece of shit

276
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:17,289
Smoke was a lawyer. He could have helped you

277
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:20,819
Smoke, okay. Those are you guys saying?

278
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:26,339
Oh, no, what did I do to smoke? Do you remember the the absolute double cross that smoke did to me?

279
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,940
Where he threw the match and like hugged the opposition after I lost

280
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,299
Ronald wiener feels great today and is in perfect health

281
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,940
Mr. Satan won 82 percent of his 17 matches

282
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,930
hardcore tag team versus blonde blunders team

283
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,210

All right, let's go

Hardcore match, you know what that means. Let's do it. What's this guy? Remember this guy from the first career?

287
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,019
I am at let's say this is a hardcore match. All right, i'm going for this guy

288
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:23,299

You don't challenge me to a hardcore match it

295
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,240

297
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,089

302
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:21,779

307
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:27,019
No, no, that's like part of the uh, right when we like vegeta upstages me and we have a rivalry

308
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:29,349
and

309
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:33,109
Right. It's like we're both strong and there has to be a big rivalry between us

310
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:39,769
And then we fight a few times

311
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:42,730
Okay, um, all right vegeta come in here let me see pass that to me

312

Let me see that thing. I'm gonna use it on him. What did that guy do that for?

314
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:57,960
Why did he do that? That guy was just showing off at like a trampoline park. That wasn't even him trying to fight anybody

315
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,359
It's like this is murder. This is actual murder but like

316
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,960
What happened? What happened to him? He like hurt his back. What happened?

Did we win

320
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:09,130

Okay into the ring

Um, he won't he's not coming back in the ring and I can't pin him out there

325
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:32,759
What am I supposed to do about this culture? I don't know what to do

326
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:57,109
Oh my god, this is horrible. Um, how do I get him back in the ring? Yeah. All right

327
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:06,309
Come here in the ring in the ring. How do I throw him in the ring? There we go. All right

328
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,219
Okay, just by the way, this is revenge from this is revenge from the my career

329
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,420
Okay, dude, you all saw that he he could have just easily had taken that fall right there and been fine. Just stay down

330
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:24,519
You're kidding me

331
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,480
Really? Do you see what the shape your friend is in right now?

332
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,760
I almost want to let this guy pin me because this is awful

333
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:52,969
Pick him up and just end it. All right, vegeta go for it. That's it

334
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:55,849
Yeah, all right. Let's this is let's go

335
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:08,570
Vegeta is upset that he was barely involved in that match

336
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:16,170
Mr satan has reached the limit of wrestling school's popularity. Yeah, I know

337
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,989
Blonde blunder severely injured his leg in that match and will be unable to wrestle for the next four weeks

338
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:28,539
Even then he may be a shadow of his former self. Oh boy

339
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,119
All order is upset that he was barely involved

340
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:54,949
Vegeta has turned face and will now be portrayed in a positive light

341
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:01,820
The year is now 2022 and mr satan has turned 26 years old

342
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:05,699
I have an 83 win rate

343
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,630
All right, give me give me some new shit

344
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm I have to get out of the wrestling school

345
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,809
How many times do I have to embarrass this guy in a singles match before somebody signs me and I can go fight somebody?

346
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,030
Oh my god, that was funny

347
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:36,309
This guy's bringing a camera

348
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:44,820
This guy was this guy's bringing a camera to

349
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:49,300
I think you can use the roster to approach a company boss for a contract. I might have to try that

350
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,780
Wait benz is back with a uh

351
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,690
He's got a little he's got all right. Okay, you want to play? He's got a pep in his step now

352
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:22,780
He's been training. All right, fine. Okay, the way I was just running around right there

353
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,809
I had so much intent there. That was like a resident evil

354
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:30,940
Two speed run

355
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,260
Turn turn turn turn turn turn

356
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:45,900
I wouldn't stop if items. I was just I just had one goal in mind. All right, come on. Let's go

357
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,059
Oh, let's wrestle. I want to promise my hitch for the chair again

358
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:05,449
and

359
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:21,690
Duplex benz is coming to avenge blonde blunder watch me break his leg too. Holy shit. That was awesome. Do it again

360
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,070
Not that way

361
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:52,599
That was miscalculated by just a small amount. I think big roll up. Let's l and r at the singles menu

362
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,309
It'll change what you do

363
00:38:56,389 --> 00:39:01,110
Yeah, I can simulate events right? I can skip events. I like playing though. This game's really fun

364
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,659
Like all right, so m dicky made this game, right?

365
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
like can we

366
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,760
I say this frequently. Yeah, maybe not that frequently but still

367
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,809
Can like can can like a venture capitalist?

368
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:25,050
Just get to give m dicky like fucking 60 million dollars

369
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:31,530
You know what I mean? And have him make like a have him get like a a team of people and

370
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:33,210
I don't know how many people worked on this game

371
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,369
But like this is awesome like imagine if m dicky had like fucking 40 million dollars

372
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,889
50 million dollars

373
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:43,289
I want that game. I want to see what that game is

374
00:39:44,489 --> 00:40:00,440
Like why can't m dicky just get like 50 fucking million dollars to make a wrestling game? He probably doesn't want to yeah

375
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:03,719
I know and i'm bad. That's me saying. This is like oh imagine

376
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,530
The charm of having this be the way that it is sure

377
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,099
Well, I hope I really hope this makes him a decent amount of money

378
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:16,420
And I really hope that he did like does well people like it because like this shit needs to be supported

379
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:26,139
It really does. All right, let's end it

380
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:33,219
Get over here. Should I change my finishing move or is this sufficient?

381
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,199
He's been really good at supporting this game on the switch since it came out in january

382
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:54,070
There it is. Oh wait, that was a scream

383
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,559
Don't forget the chair that you hit me with to win the match

384
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:19,110
his face

385
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:24,860
Did I injure him? No, okay. He's fine. He's fine

386
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,070
But yeah, this is the kind of stuff that I love to play

387
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:45,909
Like I wish like more independent devs could just just be just total creative control and just get like a decent amount of money

388
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:50,949
To do whatever they want. We've taken each other to hell and back. Mr. Satan

389
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:56,659
I've had I've had enough of it

390
00:41:56,659 --> 00:42:00,739
Why don't we bury the hatchet so that we can both get back to concentrating on our careers?

391
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:09,510
I don't know who this is. Is it bad that like i've beaten so many people

392
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:15,449
Like nearly to death in this wrestling arena that I they're all blended together. I don't know who that is

393
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:22,699
All right. Sure. Let's make peace. Why not? Maybe we'll end up working together sometime

394
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
I'm certainly had enough of working against you

395
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:31,929
All right, somebody said go to database

396
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:42,760
I it's a handicap match versus score of bends and canado

397
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:57,469
No one with money trusts creative people to make creative decisions that will turn them a profit rich people only care about getting richer

398
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:01,949
Well, that's why I meant like a venture capitalist just somebody or like an angel investor or something

399
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:20,909
They keep putting a bomb here. What are the rules?

400
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,710
What are the what's going on here? What are the rules?

401
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh shit

402
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,150
Nope, but can they both be in the ring at the same time?

403
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:49,760
Oh, this should be easy then I just kicked this I just kicked his ass like an hour ago

404
00:43:50,079 --> 00:44:10,670
Go go get a weapon reverse it got it now. Let's go for a snap

405
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,849
Oops

406
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:22,199
And look, there's also there's also the argument that could be made that like if this was changed, right?

407
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:28,840
like let's say that somebody like this got a team of like 20 people to like deliberate stuff to and

408
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,599
That he ended up being the lead and would it be the same game? Like would it be the actual same experience? I don't know

409
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:48,159
That's the multi versus four

410
00:44:50,079 --> 00:45:03,639
Oh, come on quick head smash

411
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:16,320
Wallace victory incoming. Oh my god. I'm unbeatable. I'm gonna get out of wrestling school. I'm fighting like fucking jobbers

412
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,960
Like these are the guys that that wrestled 25 like no I have to get out of here

413
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,599
I'm like I need this is way above below me

414
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
These people are just training. They're just rookies

415
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:36,360
You wonder why i'm hurting everybody's because i'm not supposed to be here. I'm fucking injuring a bunch of

416
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:46,829
rookies

417
00:45:46,829 --> 00:46:00,909
Oh, i'm going in from out here

418
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:04,019
This is like a phd going back to kindergarten

419
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,380
That would hurt so bad

420
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:16,250
But get it. I'm gonna get out of here. I need to go to the roster and like and approach somebody

421
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:47,960
And perfect perfect perfect go go go go

422
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,000
Oh, come on

423
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,519
Give them a chance

424
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:05,099
I just I shouldn't even be here. I'm unstoppable even on 2v1. Oh my god

425
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:23,769
They're trying like they're trying to get away from me. This is the shitty filler episode

426
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,059
Well, that's what I mean like, okay

427
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:30,539
Like hulk hogan used to come out and he would he would fight like like an hour before wrestlemania

428
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:33,500
it'd be like it'd be like hulk hogan versus

429
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,940
Steve anderson and it'd be like a guy and just a regular guy and it'd be a guy just to warm up hulk hogan

430
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:51,789
These are like the warm-up guys like and I shouldn't I really shouldn't be here. I'm gonna hurt him. I think I hope I don't

431
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,320
Yeah, they're called jobbers. I know that's what i'm saying. Like I feel like this is like i'm just against like the warm-up crew

432
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,869
Yet they still want to continue to fight

433
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,780
There's five minutes remaining. They're just taking constant punishment that guy I heard of rib break

434
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,940
Something broke

435
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:36,300
I need a more violent finisher

436
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:50,010
Maybe that'll help you're gonna tell you're not gonna test of strike. Mr. Staten. I'm sorry. That's not happening

437
00:48:50,570 --> 00:49:01,690
I gotta get this guy out of the ring. He's a huge problem. Just get the fuck out of here

438
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:15,179
Oh my god, my arm

439
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:19,099
Wait, who's pinning who who's pinning who did I just get pinned?

440
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:23,579
What happened they sandwiched me they sandwiched me

441
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,690
What

442
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:35,449
I couldn't move. He had me stuffed in a fucking sandwich

443
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:42,889
too good

444
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:45,530
He used the other guy's lifeless body

445
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:48,969
To squish me together and the other guy was holding me back

446
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,539
I couldn't be my character couldn't even move

447
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:58,000
lost to the jobbers

448
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:01,559
Oh

449
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:08,920
Jeremy you suck just throw all connected internet devices into the ocean. No, I you saw how much I was kicking their ass the whole time

450
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:17,130
What the fuck somebody just give me a contract so I can get out of here

451
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:24,030
Oh, he's going to maple leaf grappling. We know a guy from there

452
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:32,079
Nice to meet you. Mr. Staten. We invited you here to discuss working for strong style wrestling

453
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:41,280
All right, you're not exactly a priority for us right now, but we consider bringing you in with this deal. Oh, come on

454
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,039
That's

455
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:51,199
Four weeks. Come on, dude

456
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:54,400
All right, you give me a fucking thousand dollars to not waste my goddamn time

457
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,480
You may have commanded that much in the past, but i'm afraid those days are behind you now

458
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,920
No, what you're referring to is a contract that I signed and they took away from me in five seconds. What the fuck

459
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:16,079
Is it because I just lost those two guys?

460
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,809
Is it because I just lost to the two jobbers? Is that why you saw that on tv? That's why there's an explanation there

461
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:26,920
They sandwiched me I got whatever

462
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,000
Welcome to strong style wrestling. Let's go

463
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:40,059
Of course your friend crucial kennedy is also welcome to join you on the same terms

464
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:48,860
I don't care about what crucial kennedy does have you ever heard of a wrestler called maddie mcfly from all american wrestling?

465
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:54,719
What's this? Well, I think we could do the gimmick better

466
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,440
So how would you like to be our version of him?

467
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,860
Oh wait, they they like changed me

468
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,559
Should I imitate maddie mcfly?

469
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,949
What did they do to me? They shaved my mustache

470
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,039
No, I don't want to imitate anybody i'm mr. Satan god damn it

471
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,780
Sorry, did it make it sound like you had a choice? We need you to be more like him. So make it happen

472
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,159
I'll have to be i've missed

473
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,400
What?

474
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,400
They changed my outfit

475
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,320
Hardcore match versus calvin whatever and I that

476
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:09,039
I've had to shave my mustache

477
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:15,389
And put a new costume on it's just for four weeks. Okay

478
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,230
all right now

479
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,869
Wait, is this is this for me to change like my identity or something?

480
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:29,340
Because like i'm the guy that killed like three people in the ring. So I shaved my mustache come back with new music

481
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:35,119
What is this new music?

482
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:46,889
You can't whoa

483
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:56,800
I'm not you're a long way from home. Mr. Satan. You should have stayed at wrestling school

484
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:03,000
You may have been a big fish in that small pond but strong style wrestling is too tough for a loser like you

485
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,280
This is my yard. These are my fans. Nobody carves out a successful career here without my blessing

486
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,119
That's strange because I recall

487
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:17,199
I recall signing my contract with russell haystacks and not you

488
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,860
Russell haystacks can't protect you once you step in this ring. So you better watch your attitude

489
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:27,309
And whatever you say

490
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:28,829
i'm coming for you

491
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:34,750
You want to see how much real animal I can be?

492
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:37,469
I don't belong here, huh? Calvin?

493
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
I don't belong here, huh? Calvin?

494
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:45,639
You don't think I belong in strong wrestling?

495
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:55,789
Oops my head

496
00:54:55,789 --> 00:55:01,099
Get the fuck out of here. Oh

497
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:11,659
Let's go

498
00:55:11,659 --> 00:55:13,659
You don't belong in here with me

499
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:20,519
I belong in here with you

500
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,500
That's something I have to do it's very important

501
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:20,929
I'm sorry

502
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:35,860
This is hardcore

503
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:56,349
Get that table in here. Let's go. Goodbye and now he's going through a table and i'm gonna end it get away from me

504
00:56:56,929 --> 00:57:01,150
Midnight's over here trying to fight me. It wasn't even my fault that we fought

505
00:57:01,389 --> 00:57:17,250
We were over there and I just kind of hit it's not what I wanted to do

506
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:25,659
All right, get him on there and we're gonna end it here get on the table

507
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:47,199
Uh, goodbye count it. No still in there. All right. Oh fuck. Uh, oh, he's got a mic

508
00:57:49,300 --> 00:58:02,030

Well, he keeps kicking out

510
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,940
That's it and i'm game over. I got the respect of Calvin and Hobbes whatever this guy's name was

511
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:30,639
engineer gameplay

512
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:41,340
That encounter established. Mr. Satan as a face who has the support of the fans. What?

513
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:59,409
I got 600 bucks. I'm telling you they don't think i'm the old. Mr. Satan. I shaved my mustache

514
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:12,079
Literally being a guy with a crowbar brings the respect of the fans

515
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:18,639
Wrestling school have crowned vegeta as their new postgraduate champion nice

516
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:23,619
Listen, i'm, not sure the name. Mr. Satan captures the essence of your character

517
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:30,690
Oh, no, they're realizing that I have to change. How would you feel about being called something like?

518
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:37,980
Rio mist

519
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,940

30s is a corporate meddling

522
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:59,550
Oh, I don't want to be called real miss. I want to be called Mr. Satan

523
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:14,750
They'll all be chanting that name one day. Perhaps i'll give it to somebody more deserving. I got nothing scheduled. Let's do some uh training here

524
01:00:15,309 --> 01:00:33,489
I changed my name

525
01:00:33,489 --> 01:00:37,780
Mr. Satan forever

526
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,780
How's that for her name? You like that one?

527
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:51,570
Agility is so bad change him to hercule

528
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,340
More strength more

529
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,139

A couple of tv tapings and then a pay-per-view

01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:17,420
Oh shit. All right

542
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,420
They changed my music too

543
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:48,000
I kind of like that you look like mike meyers

544
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,739
I know I kind of do

545
01:02:53,739 --> 01:02:55,099
calvin steam

546
01:02:55,099 --> 01:02:56,619
Submission match

547
01:02:56,619 --> 01:03:01,980
Pretty good to say. Hmm. Say it say it then. What are you gonna say? Say it. Oh, you didn't you brought a mike out

548
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:07,090

Submission match that's my specialty

01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:26,190
Didn't know if you knew that

552
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:28,190
Get up. What the fuck? I just did a move to him

553
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:38,019
Your specialty is murder and submission moves

554
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:44,269
No, that's not the move. I wanted to do i'm trying to do the super kick. What the fuck

555
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:47,230
I what?

556
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:50,059
Why don't they do that?

557
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,619
I just tried to do the super kick and they did did they change my moves?

558
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:03,630
Hold on a minute. Yeah, I guess I changed. I don't have the super kick anymore. They changed my moves. Are you serious?

559
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,039
I didn't have that before

560
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:17,360
I don't like this new character. I want to be mr. Satan forever

561
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:29,659
I got nerfed

562
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:32,300
All my moves that I was good with oh fuck

563
01:04:34,539 --> 01:04:36,539
Rio mist sucks

564
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:51,059
Oh shit

565
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:52,500
Oh my god

566
01:04:52,500 --> 01:05:09,550
I have to resort to just like violence. No, why am I attacking her?

567
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:15,809
Why was I aiming at her? All right, let's pull this together here

568
01:05:22,829 --> 01:05:30,900
Yeah, they gave me just shitty default wrestling moves. None of my cool moves are here anymore and then do any damage

569
01:05:33,949 --> 01:05:51,329
I have to just rely on my strength just rely on my strength striking moves small moves punches kicks

570
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:53,820
weapons

571
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:58,219
Yeah rely on the strength if they're gonna they're gonna take shit away from me do what I know I can do best

572
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:13,119
Do you think they can't take this away from me? You can't take it away from me. Yeah, go ahead fold me up. That's fine

573
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:23,539
Ow, I need to use my rage. I do

574
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:28,610
This is such a bad arc for mr

575
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:46,260
Satan get back in the ring get back in the ring. Don't get counted up. Come on. What are you doing?

576
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:49,119
What how did that miss?

577
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:55,619
That's impossible. I'm as big as the side of the ring. There's one

578
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:03,730
No, I counted that miss

579
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:30,510
Use your strength. Oh, I don't did I do this for money? I had to change my character change my moves

580
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:34,030
So I would stop beating up fucking rookies

581
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:52,139
They have to nerf me and take uh, yeah, you can't take it all away from me though

582
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,400
Oh, yeah, you're now, you know, now, you know my plan, you know, you can't take the striking away from me now. You're afraid

583
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:08,210
That's fine. Don't worry. I'd be afraid too if I had to hit these fucking punches in the face

584
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:25,090
really

585
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:27,170
I was on the ground for so long. Don't let him submit me

586
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:38,989
Sorry, i'm too big. All right. Now let's this is gonna hurt a lot hurt him

587
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:49,069
Yep, lean into it lean into it. Come on

588
01:08:51,539 --> 01:08:53,859
Oh, i'm arching so far back

589
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:11,869
Wrench it wrench it is this health going down?

590
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:25,600
Submit

591
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:37,250
He didn't submit he will this time. You know why because it's time for the mr. Satan bear hug

592
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:46,300
Get up here here. You want me to change my voice i'm about to change yours permanently. That's not my move anymore

593
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:50,720
That's not my move anymore. That's not my move anymore. That's not my movie more that move sucks

594
01:09:56,899 --> 01:10:04,829
They made my move a kneeling chin drop. Oh my god. How am I gonna make this guy submit?

595
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:11,550
Come on, pull it off

596
01:10:11,949 --> 01:10:13,949
Oh my god, no

597
01:10:15,229 --> 01:10:20,609
No

598
01:10:20,609 --> 01:10:29,340
Come on get him. I don't know what move is gonna work on him. Look at his ankle

599
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:44,380
I have to get him by the head

600
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:56,220
No, he get back in here by the head. This is the way this is gonna work. Just pull it pull harder

601
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:08,750
Go. Oh my god. Why can't I get this guy?

602
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:28,779
What? I've been so nerfed for money. It wasn't worth it. No

603
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:49,420
All right, give me his leg again. Give me the legs. Let's go. You can't possibly take this much longer. You seriously can there it is

604
01:11:49,979 --> 01:12:01,220
That was intense

605
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:05,140
Alvin steam status has not been affected. Mr. Satan status has not been affected

606
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:19,100
What they're trying to hold me down. That's really what's going on

607
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:28,380
Okay, my contract with strong style expires next week. This is the last appearance potentially

608
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:31,329
You're gonna resign me

609
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:38,220
Mr. Satan forever. What do you think of a new outfit for your wardrobe department created for you?

Sure, I knew you'd like it a change of image could just be what you need to stand out

612
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:06,100

01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:24,180
Okay, here we go. It's just a singles match

646
01:16:24,909 --> 01:16:27,170
my last match

647
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:37,199
And i'll be free

648
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,039
Moves, I don't think I can change them

649
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:48,109
Until i'm free

650
01:16:48,109 --> 01:16:49,630
Anton apex

651
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:57,899
I just okay. I just tried I just tried to throw the mic at him and it missed by probably an inch

652
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:11,199
As you may have heard the news my contract with strong style wrestling expires next week

653
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,699
If rustle haystacks and I can't come to an agreement

654
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:23,810
This might very well be my last appearance in case that happens

655
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:26,770
I want to take this opportunity to express how much i've enjoyed wrestling for you

656
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:34,539
I've had a lot of ups and downs in this ring as well as behind the scenes, but I have no regrets

657
01:17:35,579 --> 01:17:45,460
Anyway, i'm not out of here yet. There's one last ass to kick. So let's make it a memorable one. This guy right now is going like

658
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,020
This guy kills people in the ring, what does he mean?

659
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:54,659
Why does it have to be me that had to be on this roster tonight?

660
01:17:55,460 --> 01:18:01,090
Mr. Satan just said he wanted to make it a memorable one

661
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:17,920
Wow, these are just throw dirt in my face death imminent

662
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:21,090
No, i'm not gonna kill this guy

663
01:18:25,229 --> 01:18:27,229
No, i'm not gonna hurt you

664
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:31,310
I'm just gonna kill you real I did it wrong, but you know, i'm just i'm not gonna kill you

665
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:33,949
I'm gonna hurt you real bad

666
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:42,130
We have deleted 12 and a half minutes of footage of jared leto's joker

667
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:44,689
And he's never to be heard from again

668
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:04,420
Just use the strength. That's all I have to do

669
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:11,039
Can't even hurt me notice how they change my moves from being punches to kicks

670
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,520
Mm-hmm. I only have like one upper punch in the face. That's it

671
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:22,750
I thought that was a shining reference

672
01:19:25,949 --> 01:19:30,369
Wait, that's not from suicide squad

673
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:41,329
Is that jack nicholson?

674
01:19:41,329 --> 01:19:44,930
It is. Yeah, it is right. It's been both

675
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:50,260
That's from the dark knight

676
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:51,390
Is it?

677
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:53,390
No, it's not. Wait, who says that?

678
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,319
No, that's him. That was in the trailer

679
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:27,039
All right. This guy was how what a not very memorable final match for this studio for strong wrestling

680
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:37,180
Whatever it is. Yeah, what a shit ending to my career here. It's just like a regular match. Nothing crazy happens

681
01:20:37,819 --> 01:20:52,510
You're thinking of this another scene. No, i'm not maybe I am

682
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:56,340
Make it memorable go after the announcers

683
01:20:57,539 --> 01:21:02,739
Ah shit, this is not very memorable at all. I may as well throw up two by four at the announcer's head

684
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:28,159
Fine. Hey money mark smile. You're on gameboy camera

685
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:58,289
I'm just trying to push her off

686
01:22:09,699 --> 01:22:17,140
How t-pose t-pose t-pose t-pose

687
01:22:17,869 --> 01:22:30,699
No, knock him out reverse. I don't think anyone besides you likes this game. Oh

688
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:37,649
You know when somebody i'm sorry, dude, but like that's just so that was like a just incorrect statement

689
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:41,250
It's that and that I mean you might I don't know man. I think you might be the first person to say that

690
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,039
No, i'm

691
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:53,520
Everybody most people are I mean if you don't like it, whatever. That's cool. That doesn't bother me

692
01:22:53,920 --> 01:23:02,850
I don't have to like the same things but holy shit. This is like my favorite game ever. What a not memorable match

693
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:05,970
Quick, I gotta make it memorable quick

694
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:20,699
Damn it

695
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:25,569
I improved considerably

696
01:23:25,569 --> 01:23:35,310
We don't know how to like the same thing. That doesn't matter. All right, am I gonna get a contract?

697
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,760
King david has defeated air miles

698
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,989
I think that's mankind, right? But it's not

699
01:23:47,710 --> 01:24:00,079
Okay, mr satan forever's contract for the strong style wrestling has expired

700
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:05,039
I'm going to meet with russell haystacks to discuss his future

701
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:10,060

That's the coolest wrestler i've seen so far. I want to see that costume

705
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,850
A lot happened this week

706
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:29,729
Oh my mr satan forever has been booked to face abysmal in an 18 man countdown elimination match

707
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,270
I thought that was a typo

01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:43,550

714
01:25:12,829 --> 01:25:14,189
Creative control

715
01:25:14,189 --> 01:25:19,329
All right. We can't trust you with creative control only we know what's best for your career

716
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:33,260
There's no bullshit in there anymore. I can do whatever I want

717
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:42,239
Have you ever worked with a wrestler called alan gator here at strong style wrestling?

718
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,760
His contract is up for renewal soon. So we'd be interested to know if you have any feedback

719
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:52,930
I don't know who this person is

720
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:57,090
alan gator

721
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:04,140
We need to keep alan gator. He brings a lot to the wrestling

722
01:26:04,989 --> 01:26:10,909
We'll do our best to keep him at strong style wrestling. He wrestles gators for god's sakes

723
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:17,300
Sorry to bother you. Mr satan, but i've been struggling with my finances. What is this alan gator?

724
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:25,060
Since we're such good friends. Do you think you can lend me 1300 dollars to get back on my feet?

725
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:28,720
Oh

726
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,720
Oh, no

727
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:39,380
Oh

728
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,420
All right

729
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:46,689
All right. Thanks. Mr satan. This will help a lot. I hope I can return the favor sometime you could

730
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:54,029
Oh and i'll be asking for it singles versus calvin steam

731
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:58,670
And then here's that 18 man countdown. All right, I gotta be ready. I hope i'm in shape for that

732
01:27:02,659 --> 01:27:04,659
Oh, thanks. Mr. Green. Yeah

733
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:11,329
Oh, I can change my shit again, right?

734
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:38,300
Just exit and change

735
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:44,619
No, I can look i'm gonna embarrass this guy. You may have won last time. Mr satan, but one win doesn't mean anything in this business

736
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:46,939
No, it doesn't but like four do

737
01:27:47,420 --> 01:28:13,149
In a row each time we have fought every time a bat's allowed. No, they're not. Hey, well look

738
01:28:13,229 --> 01:28:15,229
I might have a new friend in alan gator

739
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,300
Alligator

740
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:26,739
What is that? What do you throw? That was weird?

741
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:41,779
Mike was on the ground. All right

742
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,699
Make it quick

743
01:28:43,699 --> 01:28:58,239
Give us what we came for. Where's auto you'll see auto. I tell you I I you will see auto before this stream is over

744
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:12,579
I promise. I love the striking in this game

745
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:33,310
How did I miss going over the ropes? All right, this is it. There it is. There's my special move, which is awful

746
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:35,550
So we're gonna see what my back special is

747
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:46,590
That's way better short and sweet

748
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,579
I can't that move sucks

749
01:29:57,579 --> 01:30:02,140
Mr satan fervous progress is being hindered by the limitations of strong style wrestling really

750
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:16,270
Okay, always the offer from the big dog I just signed 10 weeks. Yeah, that'll go by quick

751
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:21,680
Alan gator's profile has dropped considerably after being criticized by the press. What did he do?

752
01:30:24,939 --> 01:30:28,000
What are these

753
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,680
Listen, mr satan forever. I've been keeping an eye on your progress and think some changes need to be made

754
01:30:33,979 --> 01:30:37,569
I'm not convinced you'll ever be a champion

755
01:30:37,569 --> 01:30:39,569
Which makes me wonder what you're doing here

756
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:47,390
Win a championship by the fourth week of march or we'll have to accept it's never going to happen

757
01:30:49,729 --> 01:30:51,729
Well, give me a fucking title match then

758
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:53,970
Give me a title match

759
01:30:53,970 --> 01:31:12,479
Where's this this dude joel harden? Give me a match. I heard you're looking for me. Mr satan

01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:20,930
What do you want to talk about? I'd like to I want to challenge you to a fucking title match

01:31:21,329 --> 01:31:26,909
Everybody wants a shot at my lightweight title. So get to the back of the line

762
01:31:28,939 --> 01:31:36,539
All right. Well king what about king david? I heard you're looking for me. What do you want to talk about?

I think we'd make a formidable team. I can't wait to talk out to walk out there with you. Yep

772
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:49,229
Me and alan gator are gonna stick on the tag team title. All right. Well, this is the 18 man

01:32:49,949 --> 01:32:54,239

Can't change this

777
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:43,439
Okay, we can at least do this

778
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:45,439
I want my big attack

779
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:49,279
Not that shit

780
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:51,279
Super kick give me that back

781
01:33:52,029 --> 01:33:54,750
Running front attack. Let's put this back to super punch

782
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:00,689
Yeah, bingo

01:34:00,689 --> 01:34:04,529
Jabs, I want I don't want a straight jab. I want I want the big one the hook

784
01:34:05,569 --> 01:34:07,010

785
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:09,010
Right hook long jab

786
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:13,220
Okay

787
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:19,779
Let's give my let's get a better move here special knee drop. Look at how awful that is. That is a basic default move

788
01:34:23,939 --> 01:34:31,039
We're going for something crazy. That sounds pretty good

789
01:34:31,779 --> 01:34:33,859
How just how about just a straight up just powerbomb?

790
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,420
Oh alan gator, i'm sorry

791
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:43,250
I I mean i'll do whatever you want as long as you and I can be in the ring together

792
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:45,970
Excuse me as a fucking training dummy. I don't care

793
01:34:47,539 --> 01:34:55,020
He's the comedy character in the anime as long as I can hang out with you. Mr. Satan

794
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:57,100
I could care less what you do to me

795
01:35:06,109 --> 01:35:08,109
spear spine buster

796
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:12,510
How about just the tried and true? We give mr. Satan the stunner

797
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:22,539
I think so

798
01:35:22,539 --> 01:35:25,180
I love the stunner new move. Okay, fine

799
01:35:25,819 --> 01:35:31,569
It's a sling blade

800
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:39,250
Shoulder breaker. It's very painful

801
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:49,500
That was sick

802
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,779
Oh

803
01:35:50,779 --> 01:35:54,750
Oh, that's awful. I like that one

01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:03,149
All right. Oh look at they changed. Oh, look what they did

805
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:16,460
They changed everything

806
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:25,789

01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:51,250
I can't change. No, they took they took my mustache forever. All right, this is the 18 man tag team

812
01:36:51,649 --> 01:37:05,630
How do you have an 18 man tag team? We're about to find out. Oh my god. This is gonna be fucking mayhem

813
01:37:07,890 --> 01:37:09,890

This is a war

818
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,520
This is gonna be insane. I don't even know what to do

819
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:35,630
There's too many people

820

Hugging

821
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:43,279
Hugging each other

822
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:47,600
Alan gator and I have joined forces to become even greater than the sum of our parts

823
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:52,930
And we brought all of our closest facebook friends because we don't know anybody else

824
01:37:53,489 --> 01:37:55,489
I knew some of these people in high school

825
01:37:58,699 --> 01:38:02,539
That's right, but our actions speak louder than words. So let's show these people what we're about

826
01:38:06,859 --> 01:38:13,119
Let's go out wait, it's only only two people

That's too many people

833
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,020

Okay, I don't who this I think it's this guy

835
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:13,020
Is it this person right here?

836

I don't know. I think it's this person. I don't know what could be wrong

837
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:22,399
This is fucking insane

838
01:39:23,579 --> 01:39:25,579

01:40:18,369 --> 01:40:25,739
Where am I?

845
01:40:25,739 --> 01:40:27,739

01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:35,739
Who's fighting I tagged in gator I did

847
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:39,739
Somebody just fell out of the stands

01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,380
I don't think that person was even here

849
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,539
Who's is is who's playing?

850
01:40:47,739 --> 01:40:51,180

01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,720

I just got sucked up. I just went down the toilet

855
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:22,500
Oh

856
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:25,630
Oh my god

857
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:27,939
Okay, I think

858
01:41:27,939 --> 01:41:29,939
uh

859
01:41:32,539 --> 01:41:37,819
Oh shit, everything is legal outside. Everything's legal outside. Who cares everything's legal

860
01:41:39,739 --> 01:41:49,859
Fuck the ref

861
01:42:01,710 --> 01:42:05,220
Okay, um

862
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:09,329
Okay, I don't nobody knows what to do because there's too many

863
01:42:10,369 --> 01:42:12,369
It's okay. You know, it just reminds me of

864
01:42:12,529 --> 01:42:15,810
I feel like a bunch of puppies at like doggy daycare, you know

865
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:19,250
I'll just run around like some of them are fighting each other some of them are like rolling around

866
01:42:19,649 --> 01:42:21,649
This is just puppies like a hundred puppies

867
01:42:28,859 --> 01:42:30,859
Oh, there's a commentator

868
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:35,899
Why did I get over here? How did I get over here? I don't even know how I did this

869
01:42:43,539 --> 01:42:45,539
I think he just pushed me off

870
01:42:48,109 --> 01:42:50,109
He just picked me up and threw me

871
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:54,100
I was getting too close

872
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:57,439
Oh my god, i'm on their team

873
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,680
What?

874
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:04,619
Wait

875
01:43:04,619 --> 01:43:08,699
Okay, okay. Okay. I think I found the strategy. This is the strategy

876
01:43:14,979 --> 01:43:17,060
It's impossible. This is impossible

877
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:24,020
Honestly, it's gonna take someone's gonna have to get disqualified because there's no way somebody's gonna get pinned

878
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:28,770
Who can get pinned in this?

879
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:31,550
The referee can't handle this

880
01:43:31,869 --> 01:43:34,460
Are you serious?

881
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:36,460
Why could the referee do anything?

882
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:50,859
Get me out I need to get okay. He actually is using a weapon. He's actually using a weapon

883
01:43:51,420 --> 01:44:02,239
He actually hit me in the head with that. Wait, is it he's not saying drop it. Did you say drop it?

884
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,449
All right. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out

885
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:09,949
All right. This is just okay

886
01:44:09,949 --> 01:44:16,350
This is like the titanic sinking and somebody is sitting there with a pail of water just pailing out little buckets of water

887
01:44:17,069 --> 01:44:20,829
That's you can't think you cannot rule here referee. It's not possible

888
01:44:22,609 --> 01:44:25,250
And she's just like oh no, you go out now you go out now you go out

921
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,010
Everyone's gonna run in

928
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:07,539
I love how everybody on my team is watching and not doing anything

929
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:12,430
There's only five minutes left. There's not gonna be a pin in five minutes. It's over

01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:19,920

Do you okay? Do you ask me like that guy in the lower right? It's not even supposed to be here

947
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,420
That looks like somebody's son that they brought

948
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:53,140
He's the legal man, by the way

949
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:56,380
Tag me in somebody tag me in

950
01:49:59,409 --> 01:50:03,180

Nope. No shit. I honestly now. I just feel like i'm playing dynasty warriors

952
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:23,300
God damn it. No

953
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:25,380
This is hotline miami. Yeah

Okay, I need to

956
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:39,090
Who is it? It's this guy on the ground, but I can't even look at him. Wait. Demento is seriously injured

957
01:50:43,319 --> 01:50:45,699

01:50:45,699 --> 01:51:04,100
Demento is seriously injured. Give me that chair. Give that chair to me. I just dropped that on his head

959
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:13,520
I'm surprised. He's the only one that's hurt and that make no sense. How can that be the only person?

960
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:25,859
I'm gonna laugh so hard if the dementor ends up like coming out and winning

961
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:28,829
All right. It's

962
01:51:28,829 --> 01:51:34,640
It's okay. It's it's a little it's this little guy here. It's money mark. Just keep him in the corner

963
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:37,859

965
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:46,560

Money mark couldn't end my streak and nobody else has what it takes either

973

Alan gator's profile has improved. Here's the funniest part about this

02:13:00,460 --> 02:13:03,579
Illegal illegal illegal. He's got an illegal weapon

02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:11,220
I was gonna hit him, but she turned around face

1127

You mean like why I can be good I can be don't you but we've talked about even with fable too

1129
02:13:22,859 --> 02:13:25,500
Remember when I played fable everyone was like what the fuck is he doing?

You killed an entire village in fable, too

1136
02:13:54,619 --> 02:13:59,180
I but that was the end of the stream though. I don't think that counts

1137
02:14:02,939 --> 02:14:05,260
Like that was not canon. I was like, all right guys

1138
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:08,539
I'm probably gonna end the stream here and if in a little bit and like probably like 10 minutes or so

1139
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:11,260
So like at that point when no long it was not canon

1140
02:14:11,979 --> 02:14:22,350
That was just oh it's end of the stream whatever like i'm like i'm just talking and hanging out

1141
02:14:22,909 --> 02:14:31,550
This guy's actually a pretty formidable opponent

1142
02:14:37,979 --> 02:14:43,470
Get it. He died of natural causes. No

1143
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:48,800
Into the corner. Oh, maybe not

1144
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:54,340
You can't retcon your own streams

1145
02:14:54,819 --> 02:15:02,460
Why not?

1146
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:07,329
And what about demento's death?

1147
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:14,050
You see you are making your canon. That's that's not even real canon that haven't happened yet. Demento is alive

1148
02:15:14,779 --> 02:15:16,779
He just has like a broken leg and he's like hurt

1149
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,960
Yeah, like he like broke up his like back or something, right?

1150
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:26,399
You are saying well, I don't think I don't he's probably not gonna that you don't die

1151
02:15:28,220 --> 02:15:33,970
You are saying I killed demento, but demento is not dead. So isn't that same thing? That's the same thing

1152
02:15:35,489 --> 02:15:37,489
Demento is very much alive

1153
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:40,159
Though i'm everything's fine

1154
02:15:42,369 --> 02:15:43,489
He's

1155
02:15:43,489 --> 02:15:48,130
No, you don't know we don't we haven't got an update yet. There's no update. He's gonna be fine

1156
02:15:48,770 --> 02:16:00,479
This is time to end it

1157
02:16:00,479 --> 02:16:10,420
That was a simple little match

1158
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:12,340
He's running away

1159
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:14,340
Fucking run away from me

1160
02:16:20,819 --> 02:16:22,819
I need a new contract anyways

1161
02:16:29,970 --> 02:16:35,790
Gator was trying to block me

1162
02:16:35,790 --> 02:16:45,250
Okay, so now what?

1163
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:49,329
Okay glitter arty that's very absolutely gold dust

1164
02:16:54,700 --> 02:16:56,700
So I didn't do it, but I couldn't

1165
02:16:57,700 --> 02:17:00,260
I failed to do yeah, this organization just sucks

1166
02:17:00,819 --> 02:17:07,149
Slackers like you don't belong in strong style wrestling clean up your locker and get out of my sight

1167
02:17:07,229 --> 02:17:09,469
I can't wait to hit you in the head of the chair next time I have a chance

1168
02:17:10,559 --> 02:17:12,000
more than once

1169
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:19,540
Okay, did I lose my um match with hulk hogan

1170
02:17:31,379 --> 02:17:38,219
Okay, now I can change my shit

1171
02:17:41,870 --> 02:17:43,469
All right. Finally

1172
02:17:43,469 --> 02:18:26,750

1176
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:58,260
Whoa, okay. That was weird. Which one is it? This one? I think it was these ones

1177
02:19:58,579 --> 02:20:19,100
I think it was these ones, right? They're kind of like the maroon like that. What about my chin?

1178

Yeah, what happened to my face? Why did they change my mouth my face? I don't want knee pads. All right legs. Mr

There we go. Okay. Mr. Satan's back. He's going to make his face better big jaw

Casual clothes, that's fine. Referee clothes. That's fine. Doesn't matter. All right

1189
02:22:19,409 --> 02:22:32,670
Mr. Satan has returned. This is Dementor's manager. You think I care?

1190
02:22:36,819 --> 02:22:40,420
Shank has turned face and it's now going to be in a portrayed in a positive light

1191

fucking

1193
02:22:51,069 --> 02:22:56,780
Wait a minute. I'm not sure the name. Mr. Satan captures the essence of your character

1194
02:22:57,180 --> 02:23:00,479
How would you feel about being called something like David Petrel?

1195
02:23:05,809 --> 02:23:07,090
David

1196
02:23:07,090 --> 02:23:09,409
No, I don't want to be called

1197
02:23:09,409 --> 02:23:19,379
David Petrel tables and chairs versus the grand bisma

1198
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:25,760
Okay

1199
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:30,139
What do I have coming up training versus training session training session and then a big public show?

1200
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:36,190
All right, let's go

1201
02:23:36,190 --> 02:23:44,059
Challenge somebody that doesn't have a belt

1202
02:23:44,639 --> 02:23:46,639
Wait, this is a this is a postgraduate champion

1203
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:51,600
This is the heavyweight is for the belt

1204
02:23:53,809 --> 02:23:59,860
Ask for a contract. Why is he holding a chair?

1205
02:24:00,579 --> 02:24:06,350
All right, i'll challenge somebody I find my back in wrestling school. I'm like this. I'm like the hulk hogan status

1206
02:24:07,229 --> 02:24:25,309
Talk to germa. He's in the hollywood roster. What no germa's retired while their stock goes down mine

1207
02:24:25,309 --> 02:24:40,260
Will keep going up. You're not good enough to be me. Mr. Satan. So let me show you where you belong

1208
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:44,579
I not I appreciate the enthusiasm, but this is wrestling school. I graduate

1209
02:24:45,540 --> 02:24:48,829
Okay

1210
02:24:48,829 --> 02:24:50,510
I've already been here before

1211
02:24:50,510 --> 02:24:52,340
I graduated

1212
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:57,219
Like four years ago or so and i'm going to show you I don't belong in wrestling school

1213
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:03,299
Oh my god, have I washed up? What the fuck happened?

1214
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:07,020
Oh my god, I don't belong in wrestling school

1215
02:25:07,819 --> 02:25:16,659
Oh my god, that was horrible. No, I shouldn't be here

1216
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:22,500
Jesus christ

1217
02:25:23,649 --> 02:25:25,889
No, I don't belong in wrestling school

1218
02:25:32,739 --> 02:25:34,739
I just break them through a table and I can prove that i'm good

1219
02:25:35,139 --> 02:25:50,639
Come here get up here. No get this a tables match

1220
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:53,200
Wait, wait a minute. I thought it was a tables match

1221
02:25:56,909 --> 02:26:01,440
Okay, now you now you awoke the violent now i'm violent

1222
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:22,420
I run in a circle. I get even more momentum because i'm sprinting and just gaining power

1223
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:41,280
Was my eighth victory in a row for those of you that like to keep count

1224
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:46,979
Grand visma couldn't end my streak and nobody else can

1225
02:26:57,469 --> 02:26:59,629
I am now the champion. Okay, great

1226
02:27:00,530 --> 02:27:02,530
Can I just give this to somebody and leave?

1227
02:27:02,690 --> 02:27:12,510
We're running short of staff. Could you do commentary? Sure

1228
02:27:14,219 --> 02:27:17,659
But I want to get out of here 200 bucks. That's actually much more than I was making before

1229
02:27:21,389 --> 02:27:24,750
I just don't care. I'm just gonna get up and just i'm gonna go to back to the stage

1230
02:27:34,989 --> 02:27:39,889
Go talk to germa

1231
02:27:39,889 --> 02:27:42,770
Didn't germa retire because I got dropped

1232
02:27:44,540 --> 02:27:45,420
Wait

1233
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:49,520
Remember lucy lakes?

1234
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:56,819
Germa is in hollywood

1235
02:27:56,979 --> 02:28:08,020
Mr. Staten will be joining us on commentary to share his insights in this match

1236
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:14,479
You know how long you know, how long do you think this match is gonna go?

1237
02:28:14,799 --> 02:28:22,159
It's gonna take less than five minutes. It always does you heard it here first. Let's find out. It's gonna be less than five minutes

1238
02:28:26,559 --> 02:28:28,420

versus

1240
02:28:30,739 --> 02:28:42,110
Who is this who's even in this match? It's lucy legs versus malcolm soul

1241
02:28:42,989 --> 02:28:55,329
This is gonna play back here

1242
02:28:55,329 --> 02:29:06,610
Just wear the belt and just oh i'm so scared of you. I'm so scared

1243
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:12,379
Don't hurt me

1244
02:29:12,379 --> 02:29:26,370
Is that it? That's it

1245
02:29:26,610 --> 02:29:31,870
I did it. I was about to sit down and do commentary. I told you I it always is less than five minutes

1246
02:29:32,350 --> 02:29:46,219
All right lucy lake status has not been affected

1247
02:29:47,090 --> 02:29:49,090
Rupert royals progress is being hindered

1248
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:52,430
muher pelle rosa

1249
02:29:52,430 --> 02:29:56,559
Progress is being hindered

1250
02:29:56,559 --> 02:29:58,719
Monty python has left all american wrestling

1251
02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:08,430
All the ratings are slumping

1252
02:30:08,430 --> 02:30:15,780
Oh, nice to meet you. Mr. Satan. We invited you here to discuss your working for all american wrestling. This is the big one

1253
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:21,920
We fear you'd be a valuable addition to the roster if we're prepared to make it happen with this deal

1254
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:29,100
Compensated for any health issues 1800 bucks a week

1255
02:30:29,739 --> 02:30:35,489
This is a good. This is good. I'll take this. This is a good contract

1256
02:30:38,030 --> 02:30:40,030
I don't even do anything. Let's just go

1257
02:30:41,579 --> 02:30:46,340
All american wrestling. This is the this is the big one. I gotta prepare for this

1258
02:30:53,469 --> 02:30:59,389
I can get this in 90. All right, nothing's scheduled here

1259
02:31:01,379 --> 02:31:07,200
No creative control

1260
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:17,149
Yeah, I look even when I don't have creative control. I don't even listen to what they say. Anyways wrestling revolution have poached tod snorting

1261
02:31:17,629 --> 02:31:20,670
From weekend warriors in a deal estimated to be worth 51 000

1262
02:31:22,610 --> 02:31:27,940
Damn, okay

1263
02:31:27,940 --> 02:31:33,059
Perfect shawn is sad that mike shawshot has left all american wrestling

1264
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:41,379
Maddie mcfly is glad that mike shawshot has left all american wrestling gruesome. Sharon has left all american wrestling

1265
02:31:45,809 --> 02:31:48,979
Okay

1266
02:31:48,979 --> 02:31:56,610
Hard gainer is now the champion. This is the guy that just signed me. I think that's supposed to be vince mcmahon

1267
02:31:57,250 --> 02:32:02,049
You make a pretty good team. Mr. Satan. How would you like to make it a regular thing?

1268
02:32:04,829 --> 02:32:08,909
Easy to get lost in the shuffle on your own, but we can make a much bigger impact together. Where's the gator?

1269
02:32:08,909 --> 02:32:13,920
Where's alan gator? I already have a teammate and where's alan gator?

1270
02:32:14,399 --> 02:32:23,010
Be careful what you wish for. Mr. Satan. It's better to be with me than against me. I already have a teammate

1271
02:32:26,899 --> 02:32:32,340
right

1272
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:42,959
Where am I? Where's mr. Satan? He's not with me anymore

1273
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:48,370
What

1274
02:32:48,370 --> 02:32:51,729
Wasn't he with me? He was with me here. Oh, no, I left him behind

1275
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:56,399
I thought like that we were partners. I thought that meant like they'd get him too

1276
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:02,670
Oh shit

1277
02:33:02,670 --> 02:33:12,780
I left him behind

1278
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:13,739
What?

1279
02:33:13,739 --> 02:33:25,629
Heard you're looking for me. Mr. Satan. Uh, what do you want to talk about this time? I challenge you to a match

1280
02:33:28,420 --> 02:33:32,340
We didn't work for the same old company anymore. I don't see that happening anytime soon

1281
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:40,260
I hope I get injured

1282
02:33:40,260 --> 02:34:04,579
All right versus win stevenson who am I fighting this is a packed arena

1283
02:34:09,299 --> 02:34:11,620
But you have the same name you have the same music

1284
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:16,700
It's the same music

1285
02:34:16,700 --> 02:34:27,360
That's just a slowed down version of my music. I've waited a long time for this moment

1286
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:29,360
And I can't wait to set about achieving my goals

1287
02:34:31,250 --> 02:34:37,059
You just you just pitched it down. I if perfect sean thinks he's the future of all american wrestling

1288
02:34:37,299 --> 02:34:39,940
Perhaps i'll have to challenge for the united states title

1289
02:34:41,569 --> 02:34:46,530
Or maybe i'll form my own team and give battering ron and bill dozer is something to worry about

1290
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:55,520
In my quest to own all of the gold I might even chase becky lane for that women's title

1291
02:34:56,829 --> 02:34:59,870
But of course my ultimate aim is to win the world title

1292
02:35:00,350 --> 02:35:04,590
And replace jigsaw jeremy as the face of the company

1293
02:35:05,889 --> 02:35:11,649
Sorry to wake you up from that sweet dream, but there's nobody you should be focused on more than me while you're holding two mics

1294
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:18,079
That would be echoing that would be so awful

1295
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:22,049
I'd be like

The fans will appreciate a chance to get behind you. I think they I just keep losing support

1368
02:46:00,579 --> 02:46:05,760
Get this to 90

02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:10,059

1370
02:46:10,059 --> 02:46:22,739

1371
02:46:23,299 --> 02:46:25,940

1384
02:47:29,649 --> 02:47:31,950
I just become so powerful

1385
02:47:32,110 --> 02:47:40,020
Listen up everybody there's something I need to get off my chest before we go any further

1386
02:47:40,340 --> 02:47:46,190
Put the camera a little higher. I know i've been a jerk in recent times

1387
02:47:46,590 --> 02:47:54,899
I've said and done some things that i'm not proud of but I realize we're nothing without the support of the fans

1388
02:47:55,139 --> 02:47:57,139
You're the electricity that gives us life

1389
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:05,120
With your help. I know I can be a better wrestler. I hope I can repay you by fulfilling my potential

1390
02:48:08,139 --> 02:48:11,739
Hey, we done with the life-changing crap. The only drama that matters is in this ring

1391
02:48:39,969 --> 02:48:41,969
Oh, no

I was gonna quit

1394
02:49:01,059 --> 02:49:04,739
Nine seconds. Well, it's because he has a fucking camera in the ring

1395
02:49:05,780 --> 02:49:07,940
And I picked it up and I was gonna throw it out

1396
02:49:08,659 --> 02:49:11,090
But I hit them. Ah, whatever

1397
02:49:13,059 --> 02:49:17,540
Oh my fucking god, whatever. I thought I could throw it by him

1398
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:22,690
I keep the title

1399
02:49:22,690 --> 02:49:26,379

1404
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:48,979
We may not like each other mr. Satan, but we drew a lot of money together

1405
02:49:52,590 --> 02:49:57,389
It's him. How would you feel about getting me into all american wrestling to reignite our feud?

1406
02:50:01,360 --> 02:50:03,360
Yeah. Oh, yeah, let's wait

1407
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:05,600
All right, aren't you canadian?

Thanks for making this happen. Mr. Satan. I can't wait to work with you again

1409
02:50:12,829 --> 02:50:16,180
I gotta bring him up

Oh god

1414
02:50:34,620 --> 02:50:42,500
Is this for the title? I need 79 attitude. Okay. This is just a mess. So

1418
02:50:59,540 --> 02:51:01,459
Jesus

1419
02:51:01,459 --> 02:51:04,510
It's not for the title. Okay

1420
02:51:04,510 --> 02:51:07,139
This is always just such a mess

1421
02:51:13,149 --> 02:51:15,149
Wait, aren't there 10 people in the ring right now?

1422
02:51:15,709 --> 02:51:21,120
How come I get less people?

1423
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:23,840
Wait a minute. I have one two, three, four five

1424
02:51:24,899 --> 02:51:27,139
This guy has like 15 fucking people

1425
02:51:33,729 --> 02:51:38,530
This is not fair

1426
02:51:38,530 --> 02:51:42,450
Hey duke mini man. Can you believe that we've been booked to face each other in this match?

1427
02:51:43,090 --> 02:51:48,780
This is just scripted. Yeah, things could get awkward, but I hope you appreciate that

1428
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:50,780
I can't go easy on you just because we're friends

1429
02:51:53,940 --> 02:52:11,540
Don't worry, I wouldn't have it any other way. I can't afford to lose this match either. Who's the ref?

1430
02:52:13,440 --> 02:52:15,440
All right. This is so unfair though

1431
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:21,340
Just look at how many people are in this person's corner. This is ridiculous

1432
02:52:26,940 --> 02:52:28,620
Who's the legal one?

1433
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:30,620
Wait, it's this guy

1434
02:52:39,309 --> 02:52:41,309
You're like the hulk. It's fine

1435
02:52:41,709 --> 02:52:45,459
I really am

1436
02:52:45,459 --> 02:52:49,459
All right, it's illegal to use that but it's illegal for me to drop him on his head on the way

1437
02:52:50,020 --> 02:52:55,059
You know what I mean? I don't think so

1438
02:52:55,299 --> 02:53:05,280
Jerma you're worse than rio mist. What are you talking about? I haven't lost a match in like an hour

1439
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:12,860
Duke mini man is so hurt. What happened to him? He's not even

1440
02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:27,100

02:53:48,610 --> 02:53:56,450
Okay, get him get him get him pin him pin him that's it hey welcome to all american wrestling duke mini man

1443
02:54:16,100 --> 02:54:34,590
Why he's not hurt. We're fine. I see you had fun out there, mr

1444
02:54:34,590 --> 02:54:39,950
Satan, but you made quite a mess of the arena how if you ever want to book this venue again

1445
02:54:39,950 --> 02:54:45,329
You better pay a hundred dollars towards the damages. Oh, that's okay. Fine. What did I do?

1446
02:54:52,739 --> 02:54:54,739
Need to agree for attitude gains

1447
02:54:54,819 --> 02:55:03,329
All right, that makes sense

1448
02:55:03,329 --> 02:55:14,940
Newbie nate. Okay. Have you ever worked with a wrestler called aftershock here at all american wrestling?

1449
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:22,209
His contract is up for renewal soon. So we'd be interested to know if you have any feedback

1450
02:55:22,209 --> 02:55:29,629
What would be a better attitude for me to say yes or no? We need to keep him or he doesn't belong here. What would be better?

1451
02:55:32,209 --> 02:55:33,780
for attitude

1452
02:55:33,780 --> 02:55:36,379
Probably yes

1453
02:55:36,379 --> 02:55:37,819
We need to keep him

1454
02:55:37,819 --> 02:55:43,420
Look how good my attitude is

1455
02:55:43,420 --> 02:55:46,780
All right. I don't have no idea what this one is. Oh shit 79 almost there

1456
02:55:47,420 --> 02:55:49,659
This is race against time

1457
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:53,440
And it's a last laugh match

1458
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,899
I think we're about to find out what that means. I have no idea

1459
02:55:59,170 --> 02:56:03,899
I can't uh, I cannot upgrade attitude. It's one of the things you cannot do. Let's see what this is

1460
02:56:06,909 --> 02:56:17,120
Last laugh is it the last person to laugh?

1461
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:30,899
Okay, bart simpson running the chalkboard. Keep the attitude up. I will not attack anybody the commentary table

1462
02:56:31,219 --> 02:56:33,860
I won't throw a weapon at anybody. I'm gonna just wrestle this guy

1463
02:56:40,930 --> 02:56:42,930
You laugh you lose. Yeah, but

1464
02:56:43,889 --> 02:56:47,090
How does that I don't understand this match?

1465
02:56:48,829 --> 02:56:53,389
Mr satan, you're not popular enough to be a champion. It's about time that title went to a real star like me

1466
02:56:53,950 --> 02:57:00,989
This title is too big for your little waist. You're punching above your weight jigsaw jeremy

1467
02:57:01,549 --> 02:57:07,579
How does this work? I don't get it. What do we do?

1468
02:57:08,139 --> 02:57:16,290
How do I don't know what this means?

1469
02:57:16,290 --> 02:57:18,450
Last to get a pin within the time limit

1470
02:57:19,090 --> 02:57:22,909
What?

1471
02:57:22,909 --> 02:57:27,870
Two minute time limit and it's the last person to get pinned or to get a pin

1472
02:57:28,590 --> 02:57:30,590
All right. Well, just let's just hurt him

1473
02:57:30,590 --> 02:57:31,790
That's all I know

1474
02:57:31,790 --> 02:57:34,030
Just hurt hurt other guy. You got it

1475
02:57:45,200 --> 02:58:04,100
Um, that's by eating something on the way in here and good more punches

1476
02:58:08,510 --> 02:58:11,229
He's just trying to get that at it. He's almost ready for a pin

1477
02:58:11,950 --> 02:58:23,020
I got a full 60 seconds. That should be good

1478
02:58:29,809 --> 02:58:32,500
Get it. Um

1479
02:58:35,379 --> 02:58:36,739

02:58:36,739 --> 02:58:41,489

1481
02:58:41,489 --> 02:58:44,370
Really dude, are you kidding me? That was it right there too

1482
02:58:51,090 --> 02:58:57,469

1483
02:59:00,100 --> 02:59:02,700

1490
03:00:20,479 --> 03:00:27,600
Rising sun pururisu profile has risen after pretending to champion a fashionable cause wherever it is convenient to do so

1491
03:00:29,489 --> 03:00:31,489
I don't know what that's supposed to mean. But okay

03:00:49,500 --> 03:00:54,219
This one I gotta stay I gotta make sure I stick around for this one. That's don't be this probably gonna be a big deal

1496
03:00:55,809 --> 03:00:58,049

1497
03:01:00,350 --> 03:01:02,989

Did I make this guy go heel?

1504
03:01:58,540 --> 03:02:03,979
If you pin him without defense outside the ring, you can kill him. I I don't want to kill somebody

1505
03:02:07,389 --> 03:02:09,950
You want your title back? Yeah, you're a bad guy now

Have you ever heard of a wrestler called high yakuza from rising sun purisu? Um

1525
03:04:35,059 --> 03:04:39,219
No, we're thinking of bringing him into all-american wrestling and we're wondering what you would think about that

1526
03:04:40,290 --> 03:04:43,809
That sounds like a great idea. I'm very happy that you would even consider

1527

03:05:16,500 --> 03:05:19,860
Thanks for doing this. It'll be worth it to see jigsaw jeremy get what he gets what he deserves

1533
03:05:21,840 --> 03:05:34,780
Wait, what who is why is there a person back here? Who are these people? Why this is a desk?

1571
03:10:34,739 --> 03:10:38,659
Why they dress as referees?

1572
03:10:38,659 --> 03:10:42,739

03:19:32,350 --> 03:19:40,530
That seems like so much setup for not that much

1672
03:19:42,610 --> 03:19:46,049
Why wouldn't you just use punch in face? It's so much more effective. Oops

1673
03:19:55,760 --> 03:20:11,950
Get out of here

1674
03:20:12,270 --> 03:20:14,270

1675
03:20:15,540 --> 03:20:18,340
All right, we need to get everybody out of here so I can go back to what I was doing

1676
03:20:24,930 --> 03:20:26,930

1678
03:20:40,209 --> 03:20:43,010
that's

1679
03:20:43,010 --> 03:20:48,819
I I think lola ran out of energy. She was going crazy in the first two or three minutes

1680
03:20:49,860 --> 03:20:52,899
We got to end this now and now she's just like winded. She's not what is she doing?

1681
03:21:02,379 --> 03:21:04,620
These guys are not going to get a title shot. I'm sorry

1682
03:21:05,180 --> 03:21:09,649
In fact, i'm gonna injure this guy because like this is seriously like this is i'm getting sick of this

1683
03:21:10,129 --> 03:21:22,209
lola go back there and and

1684
03:21:23,170 --> 03:21:25,170
Get the fuck out of the way

1685
03:21:35,790 --> 03:21:47,120
Cover lola has not moved in five minutes

1686
03:21:49,090 --> 03:22:02,860
I only did that to just like make the ai know that this is still a match going on. There she goes

1687
03:22:02,940 --> 03:22:11,040
All right, finally you snapped out of it. Let's go for the submission

1688
03:22:13,760 --> 03:22:16,000
Tap out tap

1689
03:22:18,420 --> 03:22:21,489
Help me

1690
03:22:24,879 --> 03:22:29,170
She woke up she woke up a little bit. That's good. That's good. She got up

1691
03:22:32,129 --> 03:22:34,370
It's having the two refs in the ring. It just bucks us all up

1692
03:22:42,989 --> 03:22:47,649
break tap

1693
03:22:48,850 --> 03:22:54,370
Get it

1694
03:22:54,450 --> 03:23:00,610
All she does are back flips you're making this so much harder just punch him you're hurting me, too

1695
03:23:03,280 --> 03:23:19,280
It hurts me as well when you do that do it do it

1696
03:23:21,120 --> 03:23:31,219
Roll up. Holy shit. That was unbelievable. But why is he still up? I'm so tired. I can't even move

1697
03:23:31,700 --> 03:23:35,409
Oh you idiot

1698
03:23:35,409 --> 03:23:37,409
You idiot you idiot

1699
03:23:38,450 --> 03:23:42,850
You're gonna make us lose this two minutes remaining. I can't even get up

1700
03:23:46,430 --> 03:23:49,170
Oh my god

1701
03:23:49,170 --> 03:23:51,170
Look at how close I am to a special, too

1702
03:23:51,809 --> 03:23:57,010
Okay, that's i've had enough about this. I've had enough of you and this is gonna end right now

1703
03:23:57,409 --> 03:24:01,809
You just wait until I don't come any closer. I swear. It's gonna be painful for you in the 30th

1704
03:24:11,180 --> 03:24:14,299
Congratulations, mr. Satan you've earned your shot at the tag team title

1705
03:24:18,620 --> 03:24:21,739
But you should be careful what you wish for because i'll turn your dreams into nightmares

1706
03:24:23,229 --> 03:24:27,649
All right, what was I doing?

1707
03:24:44,159 --> 03:24:45,629
Okay

1708
03:24:45,629 --> 03:24:47,629
I don't know what I was on the ground. It's weird

1709
03:24:51,090 --> 03:24:53,889
All right. Mr. Progress is being hindered or whatever

1710
03:24:54,610 --> 03:24:56,930
Lola's profile. Okay has improved. That's good

1711
03:24:58,899 --> 03:25:09,729
She's the tag team partner

1712
03:25:09,729 --> 03:25:11,729
Shock. Yep. Okay

1713
03:25:11,969 --> 03:25:15,809
We're almost at the huge event but this is the here it is the tag team championship right now

1714
03:25:18,129 --> 03:25:22,719
Shit. All right

1715
03:25:22,719 --> 03:25:32,770
I'm gonna have two belts

1716
03:25:32,930 --> 03:25:45,139
Who the fuck is that? Who's that?

1717
03:25:45,540 --> 03:25:57,170
Wreck bill dozer and battering ron

1718
03:25:59,139 --> 03:26:01,299
You never asked her to team up

1719
03:26:01,299 --> 03:26:02,100
Oh

1720
03:26:02,100 --> 03:26:07,200
No matter how many matches I win you ignorant people never give me the respect I deserve

1721
03:26:09,379 --> 03:26:12,020
I'll teach you some respect by making an example out of these guys

1722
03:26:12,100 --> 03:26:15,379
Oh, it's not about how many times you win. It's how many that wins to define a great wrestler

1723
03:26:16,370 --> 03:26:18,930
Even if trouble understanding that just watch how I beat you right now

1724
03:26:20,860 --> 03:26:27,729
Uh, I know I want the real partner if I quit right now. That's fine. Right and go partner up with lola

I think you lose. I I don't think you do. I think we did this before

1728
03:26:48,340 --> 03:26:50,319
Yeah, you I i'm

03:26:50,319 --> 03:26:52,319
75 positive I can do this

1730
03:27:06,879 --> 03:27:08,879
Didn't we do that before?

1731
03:27:10,049 --> 03:27:12,049
We did that before and it worked

1732
03:27:12,379 --> 03:27:17,440
what

1733
03:27:17,440 --> 03:27:19,280
What the fuck?

1734
03:27:19,280 --> 03:27:21,280
We did that before in the middle of match just to go

1735
03:27:23,040 --> 03:27:25,600
Much didn't start last time

1736
03:27:25,600 --> 03:27:31,920
Oh god, damn it your buddy alan gator suggested that you might like to join us at strong style wrestling

1737
03:27:33,299 --> 03:27:36,770
Come back to us

03:27:36,770 --> 03:27:40,290
You've certainly blossomed since we saw you last we'd like to bring you back with these terms

1739
03:27:56,879 --> 03:28:00,459
No, go fuck yourself. I don't know fine

1740
03:28:00,540 --> 03:28:04,059
I want you don't have to pay me 100 000 a week pay me 99 000 a week

1741
03:28:09,620 --> 03:28:15,219
Not getting anywhere. Let's just forget about it. I'm pleased to be joined in the studio by mr

1742
03:28:15,219 --> 03:28:23,920
Satan of all-american wrestling. So tell us a little about yourself. How tall would you say you are?

1743
03:28:26,350 --> 03:28:32,700
What my height is seven four. My height is seven three. I need to know how tall I am

1744
03:28:34,690 --> 03:28:36,690
I think i'm seven four

1745
03:28:37,540 --> 03:28:39,549
Am I seven four?

1746
03:28:39,549 --> 03:28:53,500
I think so. I don't know. How tall is this guy seven?

1747
03:28:56,620 --> 03:28:58,989
Seven three, I think

1748
03:28:59,549 --> 03:29:00,670
73

1749
03:29:00,670 --> 03:29:07,629
That's exactly right. Mr. Satan. You obviously know your own body. They liked that

1750
03:29:09,540 --> 03:29:13,299
Everybody knows your friends with lola. So tell us how that relationship is going

1751
03:29:14,829 --> 03:29:19,309
Um, really would have liked to fucking done the tag team championship with her

1752
03:29:20,260 --> 03:29:22,260
um, but I forfeited the match because

1753
03:29:22,579 --> 03:29:30,989
It was a guy i've never heard of I can always rely on lola. I can lola would be happy to hear that

1754
03:29:31,069 --> 03:29:35,250
I'm sure she feels the same way about you. Tell us how your training is going. Mr. Satan

1755
03:29:35,250 --> 03:29:43,819
How agile would you say you are right now? Not that agile. It's 75 percent. I'm not agile at all. That's exactly right

1756
03:29:44,219 --> 03:29:53,100
I really enjoyed talking to you. Mr. Satan. Thanks for your time steel cage versus pyro

1757
03:29:53,180 --> 03:30:01,540
All right, but first things first lola. I heard you were looking. Yeah, I am

1758
03:30:05,680 --> 03:30:09,549
I mean this is will we can work our way back up. Let's be partners

1759
03:30:09,870 --> 03:30:15,709
Aren't you supposed to be the world champion? Stop trying to get out of defending your title

1760
03:30:17,260 --> 03:30:22,299
So it wouldn't have worked. Anyways, who was the guy that they paired me up with first of all, right?

1761
03:30:26,049 --> 03:30:42,500
Wreck, whatever a cage match. Let's go. I've been the world champion for a long time

1762
03:31:09,200 --> 03:31:13,729
Referees coming up here. Hold on. Wait, will he uh, whatever

1763
03:31:20,510 --> 03:31:25,569
Versus pyro

1764
03:31:25,649 --> 03:31:27,229
Yeah

1765
03:31:27,229 --> 03:31:32,030
You can you get the you get to hold it you get to look at it. It's not yours though

1766
03:31:32,829 --> 03:31:38,670
I'm trying to shake the ring

1767
03:31:38,670 --> 03:31:48,290
There's nowhere to run now that I got you locked aside this cage pyro

1768
03:31:50,209 --> 03:31:52,930
Only one of us is getting out of here in one piece and it's not you

1769
03:31:56,610 --> 03:32:04,850
I'm already trying to get out

1770
03:32:05,809 --> 03:32:07,809
Oh my god

1771
03:32:13,149 --> 03:32:16,860
That's it I won

1772
03:32:16,860 --> 03:32:18,690
Wait, what?

1773
03:32:18,690 --> 03:32:20,690
Wait, hold on a second

1774
03:32:21,250 --> 03:32:24,129
That's not I don't I was what the fuck happened

1775

1824
03:39:37,760 --> 03:39:40,000
Um, but isn't it a three-way?

This guy still has this championship belt on he hasn't taken it off

1835
03:41:21,870 --> 03:41:42,590
It's probably weighing him down. Don't you think this is like weighing him down over the leg again. Everyone's just watching

1836
03:41:45,309 --> 03:41:49,200

03:41:49,200 --> 03:41:51,700

She really wasn't even interfering that much. She was just hurting herself over and over again

1856
03:45:25,020 --> 03:45:27,739

This guy with the belt is seriously pissing me off. Like he puts the belt on and then he comes in the ring

1867
03:46:28,700 --> 03:46:30,690
Get him out of here

1885
03:50:10,000 --> 03:50:21,379
Where is this guy under the ring? Did he go under the ring? I think he rolled underneath

I he's hurt. He's really hurt. Okay, but about that match next week

1930
03:59:12,610 --> 03:59:35,950
This guy's just crumbling

1931
03:59:38,879 --> 03:59:50,059
You're gonna take on the competition in this game, okay

1932
04:00:01,860 --> 04:00:03,860
Stay down so the match can end

1933
04:00:14,979 --> 04:00:41,540
Duke mini man's just fine. Mr. Satan's progress is being hindered by being in an all-american wrestling. He's not even injured

1934
04:00:41,540 --> 04:00:52,139
He's fine. He just says I want to make sure he had zero health for this fight bird boy has left sutra super lucha libre

1935
04:00:59,409 --> 04:01:02,629
The entire sport of wrestling has enjoyed increased popularity

1936
04:01:03,409 --> 04:01:11,870
This is it right here, right?

1937
04:01:11,870 --> 04:01:13,870
All right. Now we're gonna be a good guy

1938
04:01:14,110 --> 04:01:29,389
This is dan fever people are watching to see mr. Satan kill people

1939
04:01:30,430 --> 04:01:43,010
I haven't killed anybody

1940
04:01:43,010 --> 04:01:46,459
Look, i'm gonna be a good guy putting the mic down putting the belt down

1941
04:01:46,940 --> 04:01:49,100
That's it. Just a regular singles match

1942
04:01:49,659 --> 04:01:52,379
Before we go any further, let's take a look at the rules to make sure we're on the same page

1943
04:01:58,639 --> 04:02:02,290
I'm sorry

1944
04:02:04,510 --> 04:02:06,510
I don't even know what the rules are

1945
04:02:14,049 --> 04:02:19,809
Okay wrestling

1946
04:02:19,809 --> 04:02:23,729
Look if you give me a playground, i'm going to play okay

1947
04:02:24,940 --> 04:02:31,739
I if you give me a playground, then we give me a sandbox. I'm gonna make sand castle. I'm sorry. It's just the way it is

1948
04:02:32,379 --> 04:02:45,389
See, this is just wrestling

1949
04:02:45,389 --> 04:02:47,520
wrestling

1950
04:02:47,520 --> 04:02:52,780
Got him just like that spin around again

1951
04:02:53,420 --> 04:02:58,610
Okay, a couple of quick punches something around my neck

1952
04:02:59,329 --> 04:03:07,389
All right, let him get a move in

1953
04:03:07,389 --> 04:03:16,930
This is exciting. Okay. See that was his he did that

1954
04:03:18,559 --> 04:03:23,969
Right now we are just playing a wrestling game. I'm not trying to do anything weird. I'm not gonna hurt anybody

1955
04:03:24,049 --> 04:03:26,209
I'm not gonna like try to break somebody's leg

1956
04:03:27,739 --> 04:03:29,899
Just wrestling moves and that's it

1957
04:03:31,489 --> 04:03:34,370
Otto is displeased by your murder streak

1958
04:03:38,370 --> 04:03:44,479
I have my ability now special move. All right

1959
04:03:45,200 --> 04:03:47,709
And that's it

1960
04:03:47,709 --> 04:03:49,950
It was just a regular wrestling match

1961
04:03:49,950 --> 04:03:54,659
And I won

1962
04:03:54,659 --> 04:03:56,899
Yeah, see i'm we're fine. We're a good guy

1963
04:04:02,459 --> 04:04:09,700
I did get more popular for that

1964
04:04:09,780 --> 04:04:11,780

1965
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:20,000
resident sleeper resident sleeper

1966
04:04:20,479 --> 04:04:24,559
Look, you can't just go 100 on the gas the whole time. You got to like

1967
04:04:25,760 --> 04:04:36,399
popularity

1968
04:04:36,399 --> 04:04:39,069
Okay, here comes

1969
04:04:39,069 --> 04:04:42,510
May be fortunate enough to have a cushy contract, but not everybody else does

1970
04:04:44,719 --> 04:04:48,719
Why don't we all unionize until they extend the same rights to everybody on the roster?

1971
04:04:57,780 --> 04:05:02,270
Sure, that's the spirit they want us divided but together we can make a difference

1972
04:05:03,680 --> 04:05:05,680
But this is very important, but

1973
04:05:06,379 --> 04:05:08,879
I may or may not kill some of you

1974
04:05:08,879 --> 04:05:11,629
Uh, that's just the way it is

1975
04:05:11,709 --> 04:05:14,909
Steel cage match. Sure. Let's like work together. But like i'm

04:05:39,899 --> 04:05:41,899
slick dude with thomas son

1979
04:05:48,180 --> 04:05:49,940
You can't bring that in

1980
04:05:49,940 --> 04:06:00,430
I want him to fall so bad

1981
04:06:00,430 --> 04:06:11,969
Let's go

1982
04:06:11,969 --> 04:06:16,579
By the way, we decided to unionize

1983
04:06:24,190 --> 04:06:31,489
I'm trying to grab him. Why is he coming into the cage?

1984
04:06:37,649 --> 04:06:39,170
He shouldn't be in here

1985
04:06:39,170 --> 04:06:54,700
Okay, why are they both coming in all american wrestling? Please. Welcome. Mr. Satan and referencing hollywood slick, dude

1986
04:06:56,209 --> 04:07:01,229
I'm veto soprano of maple leaf grappling and i'm here to be an impartial referee stakes are high

1987
04:07:01,229 --> 04:07:03,950
But let's keep this a fair contest to find out which promotion is the best

1988
04:07:08,049 --> 04:07:08,930
out

1989
04:07:08,930 --> 04:07:16,399
Keep this guy in

1990
04:07:16,399 --> 04:07:24,139
They can't I don't think they can figure out how to get out of here. He's trying to figure out how to leave

1991
04:07:27,840 --> 04:07:35,889
Leave

1992
04:07:35,889 --> 04:07:54,559
I think are they gonna get thrown out or disqualified what happens here? I kind of don't want them to leave

1993
04:07:58,770 --> 04:08:13,219
How so is this escape the ring or are we stuck in here? I got him, right?

1994
04:08:13,459 --> 04:08:22,690
Got him right by the neck. Oh that hurts a lot. I'm ready to ask derma. This is really important

1995
04:08:22,690 --> 04:08:24,610
Do you like antelopes?

1996
04:08:24,610 --> 04:08:28,469
I don't know. I don't dislike antelopes

1997
04:08:28,930 --> 04:08:40,219
Oh my god, that's a lot of blood

1998
04:08:40,780 --> 04:08:58,829
the referee is gonna be so

1999
04:08:58,829 --> 04:09:04,850
Focused. Oh wait, vince mcmahon is getting out. He's gonna get out. I think he's gonna actually leave

2000
04:09:09,739 --> 04:09:11,739
Shake it on a little make it a little bit harder

2001
04:09:12,700 --> 04:09:27,629
Congrats to the guy spamming that finally got his attention. Now. Did I did I give into a spammer?

2002
04:09:28,479 --> 04:09:45,280
Oh, so something that I want to do before the stream is over

2003
04:09:48,479 --> 04:09:55,170
You can make your own match and I kind of want to make my own match with like as crazy rules as I can before

2004
04:09:55,170 --> 04:09:57,170
We stop playing this game

2005
04:10:00,510 --> 04:10:18,930
I think I have solidified myself as the best wrestler in the world. What else do I need like a landmine match?

2006
04:10:20,190 --> 04:10:26,659
You just fell on me that didn't count

2007
04:10:34,219 --> 04:10:48,850
Landmine match. Yeah, we'll play around with that for a while. So do I is it do I actually have to leave?

2008
04:10:49,329 --> 04:11:15,299
I think I have to escape. It's a pin. Well, there's your pin. It's called you gotta put him in a body bag

2009
04:11:31,020 --> 04:11:34,299
So it looks like there's no real repercussions for staying in

2010
04:11:35,620 --> 04:11:55,219
Vince mcmahon got out. Did he? I don't see him anywhere. Where'd he go? All right. I have to pin this guy

2011
04:11:58,420 --> 04:12:11,090
Jesus oh my god. All right, that's it pin game over. There we go

2012
04:12:11,649 --> 04:12:15,520
Those that like to keep count. That was my fifth victory in a row

2013
04:12:16,239 --> 04:12:18,479
Slick dude couldn't end my streak and nobody else will

2014
04:12:20,260 --> 04:12:22,260
He's been standing there

2015
04:12:31,200 --> 04:12:33,250
That's so funny

2016
04:12:33,250 --> 04:12:35,250
That's not a good place to stand

2017
04:12:35,250 --> 04:12:47,299
That's the best view in the house. Yeah, kind of you know white has been released by the wrestling revolution

2018
04:12:47,940 --> 04:12:51,260
Okay, tom stone a ball

2019
04:12:54,079 --> 04:12:58,479
Oh, what's this? Anyone that can beat slick dude deserves to be at hollywood as well

2020
04:12:58,879 --> 04:13:02,639
He certainly blossomed since we saw you last so we'd like to bring you back with this deal

2021
04:13:05,360 --> 04:13:08,850

2022

Because now i'm gonna go kick the shit out of myself

2025
04:13:14,829 --> 04:13:16,829

All the people watching right now, it's just like what did we just watch? Oh, yeah. Yay

2266
04:42:22,750 --> 04:42:24,750
This I can't do anymore

2267
04:42:24,750 --> 04:42:27,549
That's it. That's it. I'm done. That's the stream is over

2268
04:42:28,909 --> 04:42:34,110
Oh, what a wild two days. I don't think I can laugh anymore. I don't think I physically can look the game broke

2269
04:42:35,729 --> 04:42:41,740

2272
04:43:07,220 --> 04:43:10,900
Uh, this is game. This is absolutely like game of the year 2021 so far

2273
04:43:12,419 --> 04:43:14,419
It's gonna be very difficult for something to top this

2274
04:43:15,819 --> 04:43:33,819
It's gonna be extraordinarily hard to top this I need to climb. All right climb. I'll climb it climb. No, stop it

2275
04:43:34,459 --> 04:43:50,000

Oh, this one's not taller

2277
04:44:00,459 --> 04:44:03,790
All right, that's it. Oh

2316
04:48:20,819 --> 04:48:29,500
No, once it gets to this point, it has to go another day or two and this is going to be very

04:48:30,279 --> 04:48:37,869
Scraggly and itchy and annoying. I know I know he's like looking at me like what the hell are you doing?

04:48:40,720 --> 04:48:42,959
Uh, yeah, that was wrestling empire on steam

2319
04:48:44,259 --> 04:48:50,580
I would highly recommend that you go buy that if you thought it was fun thought it was funny

2320
04:48:51,060 --> 04:48:54,659
Is it I mean the game's really fun just as a video game on its own

2321
04:48:54,819 --> 04:48:56,819
Forget about all like the crazy shit that you can do

2322
04:48:57,840 --> 04:49:06,880
It's a fun wrestling game too. All right, come on. Come here. Come here. He just wants to leave the room

2323
04:49:07,200 --> 04:49:09,200

2330
04:49:53,580 --> 04:49:58,930
Something being stir we're talking about we're actually gonna do but just haven't had to find the time to do it

2331
04:49:59,169 --> 04:50:05,380
We really want to do the remake the video stream. We already talked about it a few times

2332
04:50:05,700 --> 04:50:12,139
And with the remake stuff, it's gonna happen

2333
04:50:12,220 --> 04:50:16,020
It just there's a lot of stuff going on to find time to do it

2334
04:50:20,220 --> 04:50:25,040
We already talked about like what it would be and what we would do and it sounds actually really fun

2335
04:50:29,459 --> 04:50:31,459
But that is going to be the end of this stream

2336
04:50:32,560 --> 04:50:34,819
And the end of this weekend

2337
04:50:34,819 --> 04:50:37,139

I don't have a plan on what game

2342
04:50:48,700 --> 04:50:51,919
it's kind of gonna be like all the other vr streams where I just

2343
04:50:52,880 --> 04:50:56,639
Download like 15 vr games and we just play them for like an hour two hours

2344
04:50:57,360 --> 04:51:01,569
Let's see what happens

2345
04:51:01,569 --> 04:51:06,529
That was a lot of fun. Also, thanks connor for the raid too. Connor dropped a raid. It was either raid or host

2346
04:51:06,529 --> 04:51:07,889

04:51:07,889 --> 04:51:09,889

Get rick and morty vr. I did rick and morty vr as a joke and everybody freaked out and hated me

2350
04:51:18,909 --> 04:51:22,479
It was like two or three years ago

2351
04:51:22,479 --> 04:51:24,959
People were very upset that I played that for like 30 minutes

2352
04:51:32,619 --> 04:51:33,979
Do it again

2353
04:51:33,979 --> 04:51:41,299
I'm not gonna play it again

2354
04:51:41,299 --> 04:51:44,400

2355
04:51:44,400 --> 04:51:46,080
Yeah, I mean

2356
04:51:46,080 --> 04:51:50,799
I'll definitely play boneworks. I want to play some stuff that utilizes those knuckle controllers. I heard they're amazing

2357
04:51:51,439 --> 04:52:02,340
Play it unironically this time. Oh, yeah

2358
04:52:02,900 --> 04:52:07,060
