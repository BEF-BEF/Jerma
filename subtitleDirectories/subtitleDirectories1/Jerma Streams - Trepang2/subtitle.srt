1
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey, what's up? How's it going? We missed you. I was live yesterday for very long. How's it going?

2
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:03,770
You're quiet? I don't know. Shouldn't nothing change. I mean, I might be talking lower. I'm

3
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:11,219
screaming and yelling like I was yesterday. Yesterday was a wild one. I'm gonna slow it down

4
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:21,560
today. Play some trip hang. Am I saying trip hang 2? Is it trip hang 2? Trip hang 2? Trip hang 2.

5
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:35,620
Is there a trip hang 1? I played the demo a long time ago. Back, what, like 6 months ago? Is there a trip hang 1?

6
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:46,980
The demo was crazy. The demo was a lot of fun. So I said when it came out I was gonna play it and

7
00:01:47,859 --> 00:02:00,760
here it is. It's out. Hey, what do you mean that the game is quite violent? Uh, this game is quite

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:09,659
violent. That's pretty much all I need to say. Because, uh, I think it's pretty bloody. Violent

9
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:23,189
game. If I remember the demo, the demo was, uh, was, uh, was outrageous. It's like fear. Yeah,

10
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:30,979
I played the demo. How the sunflowers. We're gonna go over a few things. I did say that I wanted to

11
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:38,259
show the sunflowers today, but, sorry, uh, not gonna show them today. I know people were waiting

12
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:44,169
for this. I said Sunday was gonna be the sunflower day, but I want to make sure these photos look

13
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:48,629
really good. Holly and I want to edit them, make them look nice.

14
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,389
And I don't just want to throw up a random shit picture. Like, oh, yeah, like, oh, this one and

15
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:59,909
this one. No, we're gonna curate them and make them look really nice. And then we're gonna present

16
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:11,189
them. I'm also gonna go over the house flipper lineup of streamers. Uh, that stream is gonna

17
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:23,300
be really fun. Looking forward to it. Tuesday at one o'clock Pacific. Doing a stream where I get

18
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:29,139
tentatively because still there's maybe one or two people on this list that, um, you know,

19
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:36,460
depending on scheduling stuff, some people have stuff to do, but we'll see. I think it's gonna be

20
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:54,169
probably 10 to 12 people. Can you talk faster? No, I don't know. Tentative Andy. Is stir doing it?

21
00:03:54,969 --> 00:04:00,729
Um, I don't know. Stir just might be there and just do one. I don't know. We don't have a formal

22
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:06,469
agreement that stir is actually making a house on Tuesday. He can, he's more than welcome to,

23
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:14,550
right? Like I said yesterday, uh, he's been formally invited and then formally uninvited

24
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:21,800
and then formally invited again. So yeah, if he wants to do it again, do you think that you

25
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:40,699
will take over the world one day? No, no God, no, no, no. If I take over the world, you mean like

26
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:50,490
have my own little farm somewhere and like raised chickens and goats and shit. Then yeah, then yeah,

27
00:04:51,129 --> 00:05:11,050
that sounds nice. Like Thanos. Yeah, guys, like Thanos, no other person in any country, in any

28
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:18,490
form of media, no other person has, has had a farm before. Just Thanos, just the guy that snapped out

29
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:31,850
humanity. Only Thanos has done that. Nobody else has ever done that. Why do you, you quote him every

30
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:43,990
five seconds. I need to correct the record here. Maybe back in like 2019 or something, 2020,

31
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:51,750
maybe like 2021 when end game was really relevant, right? Like, oh, whatever. I don't even know what

32
00:05:51,750 --> 00:06:06,889
year that movie came out in. So you did. Remember you reference end game for like five years straight.

33
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:18,500
So it was a big piece of media. That movie made like five trillion dollars. Okay. I'm going to

34
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:34,649
reference the popular media that comes out. It's like World of Warcraft. Yeah, I reference World of

35
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:41,129
Warcraft a lot. It was a major, major part of my life and it was like a cultural phenomenon.

36
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm going to reference it sometime and I can already see the Batchesters and that's fine.

37
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:54,759
That's fine. But anyways, yeah. If you want to go over the list, I'm going to get this out of the

38
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,360
way so we can just play and hang out. It's going to be a chill night tonight. I'm going to hang out

39
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:06,629
and play for a little while. Okay. So the tentative list for the House Flipper Invitational. It's just

40
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:17,899
me. Nobody's involved. It's just me. Let's go over how this is going to work. I have to, I have to

41
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:27,540
stall, right? Each one of these people that I'm going to save right now on Tuesday at one o'clock

42
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:36,199
at the same time are all going to start making a house. They're using the same house.

43
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,439
It's the same template. They will not know what house it is until Tuesday at one. So there's not

44
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,639
going to be a scenario where it's like, oh, it's this house. I'm not going to give them any

45
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:56,600
opportunity. This list is a bunch of friends of people that you've recognized for years.

46
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:08,040
Maybe a couple of new faces you haven't seen on this channel. Maybe friends, friends, friends.

47
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:22,949
Yes, friends. Yeah, I got friends. Okay, here we go. We got Joel, Vinesauce Joel. Looking forward

48
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:37,960
to what Joel is going to come up with. We've got Seadog. Seadog. RT Game. RT. Vinny Vinesauce.

49
00:08:41,860 --> 00:09:00,169
Poke. Poke will be joining us. Ludwig. Ludwig. Doug Doug. Italex. Italex is joining us on this

50
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:09,610
stream. And Connor Eats Pants. Those are the, those are the, that's the tentative list.

51
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:16,889
Possible one or two may be added. Still trying to figure it out. But it's going to,

52
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:39,320
it's going to be a hell of a stream. Dream Blunt Rotation. The other thing too is that,

53
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,000
so I was thinking about, okay, who, who do I think, who do I know that would actually want to do this?

54
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:51,000
And I asked all my friends, obviously. But the other thing is I don't want it to be too many

55
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,159
people because if it gets to be like 15, 20 different people, it's like, oh, we all,

56
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:02,519
you all have to give me tours of your fucking house. We'll be here for like seven hours.

57
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,559
But yeah, I think this, there might be another one or two people added.

58
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,139
Maybe somebody is like, yo, I can't do it on Tuesday. It's all good. That's the tentative list.

59
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:27,610
Still waiting on one or two confirmations. What is the prize for the winner?

60
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:44,059
Absolutely fucking, absolutely nothing. Absolutely zero. Nothing. But here's the thing.

61
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:54,600
You're going to be graded. It's not just, oh, make a house and whatever. And all these grades are

62
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,080
just, the grades are absolute horseshit guys. All right. This is not a real competition.

63
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,960
Can I, I got to make that really clear. This is not a real competition. We're just going to

64
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,179
fuck around for a few hours. You know, this is not a real competition. But if you want to know what

65
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,710
you're going to be graded on, I put a lot of thought into this. Contrary to popular belief,

66
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:31,159
the grading system is loud. Sorry, that was so loud. The grading system is going to be as follows.

67
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:39,779
It's going to be weighted, a 100 point scale from A plus to F. F is always 55 points. You cannot get,

68
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:47,399
you cannot go below 55 points in a certain category. Creativity is worth 35%. Complexity

69
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:54,549
and structure is worth 25%. Cleanliness is worth 15%. And philosophy is worth 15%. Now you're

70
00:11:54,549 --> 00:12:02,629
probably wondering, that does not make 100% Jeremy. That's where you come in. Chat's grade

71
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:08,120
is going to be worth 10%. Because I know of like, some of you, like, like Stirr said, the person,

72
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,340
the person that makes the auto house, some of you guys are probably going to give an A plus to.

73
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:21,289
But I want to be the one that decides. What are you going to be doing while they're making their

74
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:30,120
houses? That's a great question. I haven't figured that out yet. It's only going to be like 60 to 80

75
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,820
minutes. So I don't know. It's possible. Maybe I'll just jump around and look and see what people

76
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:45,210
are doing. I'll do browser games. But yeah, everyone's going to have a slot. So people are

77
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,740
going to have about five to 10 minutes to do a tour. And this is where it can get pretty bloated,

78
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,080
right? If this is, I'm trying to think of, okay, who, who can I invite? I don't want to just,

79
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,279
and I don't want to invite a bunch of people and then have to take it back. Cause it's like,

80
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:05,190
oh shit, actually I invited too many people. And you know me, I don't really fucking know anybody

81
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,110
anyways. I know very, I, my circle on, on Twitch and in the kind of content creator world is

82
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:21,720
actually fairly small. So, you know, I try to include as many people as I can, if I can. But

83
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:36,470
yeah, it's going to be a fun day. You're actually lying? Wait, what? What are you lying about? This

84
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:44,870
stream is not happening? No, what? This stream is happening. I've, I got, I got a whole document

85
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:52,759
about this stream. Okay. But anyways, yeah, we're going to grade. Well, I'm going to grade and then

86
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:58,730
you're going to give the ending grade and whoever wins and loses. It doesn't matter. It's all for

87
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,909
fun. Anyways, this whole thing is for fun. I made sure to tell everybody like, Hey, this whole thing

88
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:15,139
is just horse shit. Just everybody should know that they're talking about how you promised to

89
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:23,100
finish breath of the wild. Oh, they're talking about something else. You're wasting everybody's

90
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,980
time. What? You can't just have fun. Not everything has to, what do you mean? We can't, we can't just

91
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:44,700
have. All right. That's a bait comment. That's a bait comment. You didn't even let me trickle in

92
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:54,460
first. Uh, well, it's been like 15 minutes. Yeah, it should be fun. And again, that list might grow

93
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,820
by one or two. It might also reduce by one. Like I said, but that's just a tentative list. I wanted

94
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:05,820
to wait to tell everybody that because give people time to figure out if they can do it or not. Yeah,

95
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:22,789
we'll see. We will see. It's going to be fun. What the fuck are the stream tags? I have not

96
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:29,269
typed in a stream tag ever. So whatever's there, I don't know. I didn't even do it. One of the mods

97
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:36,570
just did it. They're like to fuck with me. You should delete them. I honestly, I don't even care

98
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:43,029
enough to delete them. Is that, you know what I mean? I could go over here right now to the dashboard

99
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:47,450
because on my other monitor, I have my dashboard and I can, I'm hovering over one of the X's for

100
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:53,980
tournament arc. I could click the X right now. I could do it right now. But the effort to click

101
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:03,139
that X is just not enough in here. I mean, I just don't even, you know, I can't do it. I just, I

102
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:12,700
don't care. But of the people that I mentioned there, I'm very curious as to, because there's

103
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:20,220
one of two ways to take that stream on Tuesday and that's going all in and doing house additions and

104
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:26,259
putting up custom wallpaper and shit and doing a full redecoration of the house. And then there's

105
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:29,620
like, I imagine some of them just going to put like a nice couch in a living room and like put

106
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,870
a painting up and maybe not even paint the walls and just be like, hey, what do you think? It's

107
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:46,970
going to ask. I'm very, very excited about this. I think this is going to be really, really fun.

108
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:53,909
Last time Ludwig tried. Ludwig, I'm, I don't know if I would, I think Ludwig is going to make a

109
00:16:53,909 --> 00:17:05,319
pretty good one. Ludwig has experience because if you don't, we did this on Ludwig's bros versus

110
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:14,339
bros, bro versus bro. So Ludwig has experience. Conradepants also has experience because he was

111
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:20,660
the one that graded it last time. So, and there's also a lot of people on this list have played a

112
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:27,910
lot of house flipper. That was part of my decision too, was have they played this before? Hmm. There

113
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:46,700
are some house flipper veterans that are on this list. When is this Tuesday at 1 PM Pacific? Are

114
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,509
you going to make a house? I don't, I don't know. I might just mess around in house flipper for the

115
00:17:51,509 --> 00:18:14,789
60 to 80 minutes that people make a house. What the fuck is a Tuesday? All right. You guys ready?

116
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:21,460
Let's play. Uh, going to be just hanging out playing the game. Yesterday was kind of wild.

117
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:27,500
I'm going to dial it back a little today. What about Stirr? Stirr, that's what I mean by this.

118
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Still a few people that I'm not sure if they're going to do it or not. Stirr is just one of them.

119
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,490
Stirr might just jump into the discord call and just be like, hey, I made one. And he's like,

120
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:49,059
okay, well, I'm going to grade it. You starting at 1 PM on a Tuesday is never going to happen.

121
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:56,009
Well, when there's 11 to 14 different streamers that are going to all be there at that time,

122
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:01,289
I better fucking be there because it's, it's my event. So if I'm not there, that's a big problem.

123
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:11,000
That would be bad. So I have to be there at 1 PM Pacific time. When like 10 to 15, like,

124
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,079
it's going to be like probably 12, maybe 11. It might be 14 though. It might be like 15. I

125
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:24,700
don't know. It's going to be, it's going to be a lot of people going to be late to your own event.

126
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,420
Yeah. Stirr's house could be the waiting house while you're waiting for other streamers.

127
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:37,990
That's actually not a bad idea. Are we going to, am I going to have to send a DM to Stirr to do

128
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:44,359
another five nights at Freddy's stream where he just discord shares me him making a house for like

129
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:51,980
an hour and he's not even being graded on it. I would just like watch him play the game and then

130
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,819
he'll just leave. He'll just leave after that. He'd be like, all right, I'm out of here. And

131
00:19:55,819 --> 00:20:09,190
he'll just leave the call. He doesn't even care to be like a part of the festivities. So you're not

132
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:16,579
even streaming the, oh no. Yes, I am. I am. So how it's going to play out is after the hour goes by,

133
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:22,920
each person is going to have a, about a seven minute time slot and they're going to share to

134
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:30,089
me their screen and we are going to go through a tour. They're going to give me a full tour

135
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:39,259
and I'm going to be taking notes stalling. Well, I mean, this is an important stall. This is a,

136
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:45,589
this is, this is the big house flipper event I've been talking about the last few weeks.

137
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:53,109
I think it's an important stall. This game can be pretty loud even if you lower the volume.

138
00:20:53,109 --> 00:21:00,680
That is great for me to know because I will drop it even further. Thank you.

139
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:15,319
All right, let's go. Trapang 2. Here it is. New game. Uh, I, I'm not picking rage mode.

140
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:21,609
Hold on. What is this? Easy? Have some casual fun. We won't judge. Oh. Recommended difficulty

141
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:26,970
players who occasionally play FPS games. Recommended for experienced FPS players looking

142
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:33,940
for a challenge. What about experienced FPS players that are not looking for a challenge?

143
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:42,420
How come there's not a normal plus? Uh, punishingly difficult. You will die a lot.

144
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,059
Ridiculously difficult. Expert mastery of the game's mechanics and exploits are required to

145
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:51,740
play on this difficulty. And then enemies have eyes in the back of their heads.

146
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:58,069
Instant reaction times and near perfect accuracy. Only some kind of sick and twisted person could

147
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:15,690
enjoy this. I was playing on normal. I don't care. What the hell? All right. Double headphones going

148
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:31,029
in. Normal. Omega low. Yeah, that's fine though. I've said this before. When you're over 35,

149
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:35,140
you can pick normal. It's fine. You can pick normal even if it doesn't matter how old you are.

150
00:22:36,819 --> 00:23:05,529
Stop judging people for playing video games the way that they like to. No audio. I'll turn it up.

151
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:22,329
This is me. Face cam. We've been good. No, not today. Not today. No face cam. We're in the

152
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:34,779
chill zone right now. All right. Well, it actually is kind of loud. Still. Can you do a nose cam?

153
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:48,180
No. Did I just get shot in the head? That'd be so funny if it just started like that.

154
00:23:49,660 --> 00:24:04,819
Audio is fine. I can see it over here. This needs to be changed though. 60% for everything.

155
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:17,829
Yeah, this is fine. Maybe turn the effects down. Bring this up. Bring the master volume up. Right?

156
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:30,099
Two cheats. I need to play the game first. Producer Andy. Here we go. This needs to be much

157
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,500
like six maybe. You still have a beard? No, it got way too hot. I had to shave it.

158
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:58,299
All right, here we go. Wait, the physics even work when you walk? What do I just do? Can I pick that

159
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:13,930
up? Have you seen the giant LED ball in Vegas? That thing is fucking crazy. You know what I'm

160
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:27,349
looking forward to? I'm looking forward to when that becomes a giant snow globe in the winter.

161
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:45,220
It can be anything. Is there a sprint? That has to change immediately. Input. That needs to be E is

162
00:25:46,420 --> 00:26:03,640
where is it? Cloak. Okay, we'll do cloak F and then interact as E. Oh, there is no sprint.

163
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:15,769
Oh my god. They were moving way faster. It's getting ready. It wants to do it.

164
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:27,180
The dot appears in the center of the screen when you were in shadow. Oh, so the dot means that I

165
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:33,880
can't be seen. Do they have audio devices? Do they have organic audio devices on the sides of their

166
00:26:33,880 --> 00:27:03,210
heads? Am I going to get spotted? You can be seen in the darkness. If they let you rent the sphere,

167
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:14,619
you should put an image of your face there. Oh yeah, this is your captain speaking. We're landing

168
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:19,579
in a nice beautiful sunny Las Vegas. If you look out your left window, you actually hear the strip

169
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:26,549
is in view as we're landing here. Take a look at the sphere today is the sus guy. I don't know if

170
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:43,700
any of you know who that is. Well, your answer to the question is no, I don't have like an extra

171
00:27:43,700 --> 00:28:09,849
six million dollars. So no, sorry. Health pack, right? Why not? Is there a flashlight? Here we go.

172
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:29,269
Is it too loud? I have a feeling it's going to get very loud here in a second.

173
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:41,940
I just looked at the you're tripping. Am I? I feel like it's going to go loud. Just be aware.

174
00:28:41,940 --> 00:29:04,779
It's probably going to get loud. Locked. He said rage mode has a warning if you click it.

175
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:17,690
Rage mode is insanely difficult. Basically anything will kill you instantly. It is not

176
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,970
recommended unless you have a minimum of 50 hours spent in the game. Our publisher even

177
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:32,940
asked us to remove this mode. Are you absolutely sure you want to proceed? Oh my God. That's so

178
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:39,029
funny. All right, so I got a gun. Let's do a shoot test to see how loud this is.

179
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:51,019
That's it's all right. I might need to drop the sensitivity a little more.

180
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:11,940
Maybe five. All right, let's go. Oh my God. Okay, that's going to freak me out. I'm going to keep

181
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:25,700
things behind me. It's an autosave. That's good. There's a jump. Cool. Jump and melee to do a

182
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:34,089
powerful kick. Oh, that's right. There's a big, there's a big jumping kick. What did I just hit?

183
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:48,900
I just broke my leg. Did you really just say there's a jump? Cool. Slide is alt. I think I

184
00:30:48,900 --> 00:31:11,240
want to change that. What does Q do? I think I want Q is slide. What is Q? Focus. Alt for me is

185
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,039
weird because I have to take my hands off of, um, my thumb is like in a weird spot. I'll try it.

186
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:23,750
Middle mouse is not a bad one either, but I'll try it as it is because I'm going to hit the windows

187
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,809
key. Yeah, now I'm going to change it. Now I always hit the windows key if alt needs to be pressed a

188
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:35,049
lot. So let's change it. Let's make it something else. You press using your thumb. What do you

189
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:50,410
mean? Would you use something else besides your thumb? I know what to do. Watch this. Mouse four

190
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:56,660
for slide. Sounds pretty good. And then where's grenade? Grenade is going to be mouse. Uh,

191
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:10,460
mouse five. Let's try that. Yeah, that's much better. That's great. Pick up Intel site 14

192
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:30,380
security message log. Read it. Cool. Well, actually do I need to know this? Cool. All right,

193
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:46,119
let's go. This is a stamina bar. This is locked. There is a flashlight. Oh,

194
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:50,579
enemies can see the flashlight. This was the demo, wasn't it? I remember playing this in the demo.

195
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:11,700
He's so high right now. I'm not. We're just enjoying video game. Is this game like fear?

196
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:43,420
It has been compared to fear. Yes. Checking on the tunnel. Who's he shooting at? He just

197
00:33:43,420 --> 00:34:20,860
shooting at his friend. They know where I am. Got him. Slide. Wait, somebody, somebody over here.

198
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:35,559
We're both stupid. We can't even hit each other. Oh yeah, that's right. I forgot.

199
00:34:35,559 --> 00:35:07,510
I forgot you could do this. Is he dead? Wait, did I come this way? Wait, did I come this way?

200
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:26,250
I think I can this way. Okay. Um, this is where I just bought everybody. Where's the goal?

201
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:35,639
It's concrete. I don't know where I'm going. Uh, that's a rule on this channel. If, if the,

202
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:51,860
the walls are all concrete, I don't know where I'm going. I actually don't know if everything,

203
00:35:51,860 --> 00:36:01,829
if the walls are gray, I'm not going to know where I'm going ever. If you're wondering why

204
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:06,469
game companies made the, for you to go like it hit the side of your head with your finger

205
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:12,869
and a line goes on the ground, it's because of me. Blame me. It's all my fault. It's my fault.

206
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:26,650
I'm the one that they do that for. Cause I shot and fought people in here. Is there a map? Uh,

207
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:32,440
I don't, maybe not yet. I'm sorry. I'm reading chat too. So the, the walls are concrete. I'm

208
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:43,980
looking over a chat every 10 seconds. Is this right? Going the yellow doors. Dude, you're going

209
00:36:43,980 --> 00:37:23,510
backwards. Yellow door and then up. And that wasn't I just up here? Kick the red doors. Okay. I, I

210
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:50,090
found it. Oh, she that scared the shit out of me. Oh my God. Wait, that guy's a different gun.

211
00:37:54,170 --> 00:38:21,900
There's no aim down sights. There, there's the slow down. Cool. I have full health, but on hard.

212
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:29,500
I might, I might, I might. Okay. You don't have to be sprinting to the, to the slide. That's,

213
00:38:29,500 --> 00:39:10,340
that's cool. Shotgun. Ooh. Yeah. I, I always pick the shotgun. Intel. Where are they? Oh my God.

214
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:24,710
God, this is violent. This is a violent game by the way. Wow. That was loud. I can't see

215
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:51,289
anything. All right. Flashlight off. What's all over my gun? The oil. This is blood. It's blood.

216
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,150
That looks like a CS go skin. There's so much blood and guts all over it.

217
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:27,130
That's like a factory new fucking bloodstained weapon. That guy exploded. My God. What the

218
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:37,019
this guy live. What the fuck? That guy was climbing like Spider-Man on the wall.

219
00:40:44,809 --> 00:41:02,809
Okay. That was crazy. Anything else in here? I'm going to have to get good pretty soon though.

220
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:09,269
There's a lot of things you can do with the slide. It seems sprinting costs stamina. Killing enemies

221
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:25,699
temporarily boost stamina. Okay. You're playing on baby mode. I might turn it up to hard baby mode

222
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:34,360
would be easy though. Actually you're laughing. People are exploding. I mean, it's, it's kind of

223
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,199
a wild thing going on in the screen that sometimes you don't know how to react to what's happening

224
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:55,670
in front of you. Geez. You know, there's a game mode you can turn on where it's confetti instead

225
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,570
of blood. I must want to turn it on for a little bit. Let's do actually let's do it. I'm curious.

226
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:31,019
I want to see what it does. Confetti pyro mode pyro vision. Yeah. I still might need to turn the

227
00:42:31,019 --> 00:43:00,280
sensitivity down. Are we supposed to recognize this person? Oh, a big token. Can you take the

228
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:25,800
sword? I guess you can't take the sword. What the hell was that? They would definitely hear that.

229
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:42,360
There's nobody back here. Don't mind that. What just happened to the wall? The wall just,

230
00:43:42,360 --> 00:44:03,929
that was weird. I got all ammo. Uh, let's go shotgun. What just happened?

231
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:13,699
I thought that guy was me for a second. Can I take a second just to understand?

232
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,500
I thought I pulled out into third person mode somehow and that that was me in the room.

233
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:34,420
The confetti is funny. I want to get one more person with the confetti and then we're good.

234
00:44:41,179 --> 00:45:31,510
Wait. Secrets. No. Keep it on. Okay. I'm going to try to melee kill. Let's go. Turn up the FOV.

235
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:46,820
I think it's at 90. Fast movement and nauseous. Uh, is that 90? Should I go higher than 90? 100?

236
00:45:46,820 --> 00:46:02,780
Go 110. Let's try 110. Oh, that is a little better. Okay. Also, I want to put the, let's

237
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:14,039
put this back on. Turn v-sync off. Turn v-sync off. Turn v-sync off. Turn v-sync off. Look sorry

238
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:36,599
for me. Oh my God. That guy just tried to do a roundhouse kick to me. That guy just roundhouse

239
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:52,070
kicked me in the head. We're going a little bit, we're going a little bit lower on the sensitivity.

240
00:46:52,070 --> 00:47:10,869
Let's go. I don't have any throwables. No grenades. Did that screen shake? I turned the screen shake

241
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:23,289
off. I feel like I'm trying to score like a touchdown. Like, oh, he's got the ball. He's

242
00:47:23,289 --> 00:48:00,389
jumping over the offensive line. Oh my God. Turn the difficulty up. Let's try it. Watch me die in

243
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:20,630
one hit now. Oh, what's up? I thought the chair was a person. Oh, I got grenades now. Grenades

244
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:27,559
explode on impact. All right. We're going to have to make this work. Use silenced weapons

245
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:45,190
to shoot out lights. Wait, where was there a silenced weapon? Oh, uh, go in complete darkness.

246
00:48:45,190 --> 00:49:43,059
Get out of here. Oh my God. Who else? Who else? Geez. That guy killed himself too.

247
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:59,800
All right. This time, let me not do what I just did because I, I thought whatever. All right. I'm

248
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:17,769
got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Any more lights? Forget about all the noise in the moving

249
00:50:17,769 --> 00:51:00,949
chair and desk over here. What? I'm just staying down. Got him. Oh, all right. I got a cloak too.

250
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:07,420
I got to use the cloak more often. I am just breaking everything I touch. Stop. What the

251
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:46,840
fuck? How do you miss when you're invisible? Open the fucking door. Open this. Open the door.

252
00:51:47,559 --> 00:52:14,099
Give me all right. What do you got? All right. I got a good spot here. Uh, yeah, I'm, I'm taking

253
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:46,730
this. Give me this thing. Weapon part acquired laser. Ooh, customized weapon. Ah, um, that's kind

254
00:52:46,730 --> 00:53:16,090
of cool. Enemies can see the laser. I'm ready to take the other part. There's another part.

255
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:42,780
I missed a part. Where was this other weapon part? Oh, it's the briefcase. Okay. I thought it was

256
00:53:42,780 --> 00:54:00,420
ammo. Can I put two suppressors on this? So it's like a big long end of the barrel.

257
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:12,469
Bolded stock, higher recoil, but slightly faster reload times. I'll keep that. Can I put the

258
00:54:12,469 --> 00:54:20,309
suppressor on the shotgun? Why do people compare this to fear? I just got her. I don't notice it.

259
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:24,860
I think it's mainly the slowdown mechanic. First person shooter slowdown mechanic.

260
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:47,719
Lots of, you know, crazy physics shit happening. How would you even see me? Oh my God. I'm

261
00:54:47,719 --> 00:55:17,269
invisible. I'm invisible. I'm invisible. Got them. Oh, those aren't lasers aiming down the hallway.

262
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:24,199
I thought those were laser sites. That's just my vision doing that. What? It is lasers. What the

263
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:39,559
fuck? It is lasers. What? It is lasers. I, I, okay. I promise I haven't taken any fucking edibles

264
00:55:39,559 --> 00:56:07,260
today. I thought it was just these doing that. Okay. Well, can I get in here? I don't want him

265
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:38,360
to see. The fuck is that? Oh, this is a good guy. Subject 106. Accessing user memories.

266
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:46,219
Successful uploading. Subject 105 termination. Upload complete. Incoming message. The cycle begins

267
00:56:46,219 --> 00:57:06,119
again. Capture means you will be forced to complete your original mission. Exiting program. What the

268
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:24,840
heck? Where is my health? Just lower right. I remember this room. This is the crazy room from

269
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:51,530
the demo. Fuck. Get everything quick. Supermarkets sweep this shit right now. What the fuck?

270
00:57:56,409 --> 00:58:02,409
I slide tackled that guy's helmet off. I tried to fucking hit melee him. I tried to melee him.

271
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,550
Oh my God. Okay. I'm going to, I got to run. I'm going to die.

272
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:37,219
What's that guy doing? He's still alive. Quick, quick, quick. More, more, more stuff.

273
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:59,900
Why did the, why did the grenade take so long to go off?

274
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:26,809
What? Is he still alive? Is he still alive? You've got to be fucking kidding me.

275
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:53,579
That was fucking crazy. Uh, no, wait. There's another door. Where is this one? All right.

276
00:59:53,579 --> 01:00:24,889
Fuck face. This game is great by the way. This is wonderful. Wait, can I, hold on.

277
01:00:25,530 --> 01:01:10,019
I, I need, okay. Here we go. Oh shit. Oh my God. It's right behind me. Oh man.

278
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:30,280
How the fuck? Oh my goodness gracious. Can they see me? Hey, stop firing. I got your friend right

279
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:43,019
here. Stop firing. Stop firing. I got your buddy right here. Stop firing. Okay. Nevermind.

280
01:01:43,019 --> 01:02:15,750
Let's go. Okay. Where are they coming out? In there. Fuck you. Like a fucking cockroach.

281
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:19,510
I'm just like impossible to get like tilt. It's just like there. Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

282
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:33,340
Did it go behind the couch? I don't believe that spider go. I don't know. I'm dead. Okay.

283
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:46,699
You play like a rat would play. Yeah. That's what I mean. It's just like,

284
01:02:47,659 --> 01:03:06,260
I'm like a squirrel that got in the room. What the hell? Why did a fucking bomb just go off?

285
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:18,679
How come I can't do my slow down anymore? It's in a queue. Did they take it away from me?

286
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:47,530
I have to fucking try to do this. Oh, I have like no ammo. All right. All right. All right.

287
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:50,969
All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm having too much fun being a fucking weirdo.

288
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:26,440
Oh, fuck. Okay. This is hard. So I said the assault rifle is terrible.

289
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:32,570
This is a gug at a game. You shouldn't be standing still. I, yeah, I know, but I need to,

290
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:38,570
I don't have any charge. I'm going to turn the brightness up as well too. All right. Hold on.

291
01:04:41,429 --> 01:04:56,150
Why did I just pick this up? There's too many of them. There's too many of them.

292
01:04:56,789 --> 01:05:06,809
That guy's covered in our armor. Get away from me with that thing on your back.

293
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:08,969
Get away from me with that thing on your back. Get away from me with that thing on your back.

294
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:44,579
I ran into fucking bullets. I'm just going this way. Fuck it. No, give me that. Blow up already.

295
01:05:44,579 --> 01:06:25,960
God damn it. Holy shit, dude. Oh my God. Somebody help me. Oh, no. Give me your gun. Give me your

296
01:06:25,960 --> 01:07:35,900
gun. Stop floating around. Stop. Oh my God. All right. Here we go. Close the door. What the fuck?

297
01:07:35,900 --> 01:08:02,969
This guy's going to blow. Okay. I'm good. Was he alive? I thought he blew up. Hold on.

298
01:08:02,969 --> 01:08:48,250
We get to go up a little bit higher. What the hell just happened? I got ammo. I got ammo.

299
01:08:48,250 --> 01:09:12,359
What the fuck, dude? Dude, I just made popcorn. I didn't even fucking hurt the guy.

300
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:39,619
What the? Oh my. Okay. Can I put it down to normal for a second? Holy shit. This is crazy.

301
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:51,350
This is a boss fight. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm just going to sit right here

302
01:09:51,350 --> 01:10:55,399
and I'm going to grab them when they get over here. Oh, fuck. Got it. Oh shit.

303
01:11:00,569 --> 01:12:02,470
Okay. Got him. Where'd he go? No, don't die. Oh my God. One left. One left. One left. I got it. I

304
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:20,470
got it. I got it. I got it. Got him. Holy shit. That was fucking wild. 106 is approaching the

305
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:34,100
hell. I remember this part. I remember this is the demo and then I thought these were enemies.

306
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:41,560
I fucking shot this guy. We're going to get you out of here. Don't do that again. I killed this

307
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:53,510
guy. I thought they were not. I mean, after that, come on, do it again. Sorry. I did a lot of

308
01:12:53,510 --> 01:13:01,560
screaming back there. It's time. I got to pull it back. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't. There's

309
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:24,359
an achievement. There are consequences. No, I'm not doing it. There was at least four or five voice

310
01:13:24,359 --> 01:14:04,310
cracks during that as well and I'm very embarrassed by it. It happens to everybody. All right. I bet

311
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:37,430
you couldn't even point out where Tripp Hang is on a map. No, I couldn't. Okay.

312
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:53,539
So now that that's the kind of tutorial for zone, that's the demo. What do you do from here?

313
01:14:54,180 --> 01:15:05,739
It's a very pretty game, I will say, and it runs really well. Something I think developers that

314
01:15:05,739 --> 01:15:28,180
make games like this, it runs very well. It's like, it's pretty smooth. Do you have a 3090? Yeah. Is

315
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:35,659
it how is 3090 still considered like good? How much more powerful is the 4090 compared to the 3090?

316
01:15:35,659 --> 01:15:51,819
Because I usually wait two or three generations. Should I wait till like the 5080 or like the 6090?

317
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:57,539
You don't stream in 1080p. Yeah. You know, that's going to change pretty soon here. The one thing

318
01:15:57,539 --> 01:16:06,229
that sucks about having like a 1080p stream, the one thing I'm worried about is I just turning,

319
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:11,670
I would have to turn the bit rate up or I'd have to drop. I mean, maybe I'll just get like a

320
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:27,060
streaming PC or something. Which bit rate sucks anyways. Yeah. You have a 4090? No, I have 3090.

321
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:32,250
Do you play at 4k or 1080? If you're at 1080, you don't need more than a 3090.

322
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:40,569
Yeah, I don't play in. Well, hold on a second here. I do play in, this is, this is 4k, right?

323
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:55,159
Technically. Isn't that 4k? No? Wait, what is it? Two? What is it? 2k? That's not even 1440.

324
01:16:55,159 --> 01:17:03,140
That's not even 1440. That's not even 1080p. Dude, that's better than 1080p. That's better than

325
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:22,420
1080p. Wait. Oh, oops. Okay. Now I'm playing in 1440p. Looks pretty good. Damn. Looks nice.

326
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:33,050
Yeah. That was a weird resolution. That's the kind of resolution that old, old games,

327
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:39,689
I remember like Warcraft 3, seeing some of those weird resolutions that they made for that game

328
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:47,850
that you could have for like probably eight people that had that monitor. All right. So

329
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:57,989
what do we do here? Cheats. Complete mission on hard. All right. So I have to beat all these

330
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:13,289
missions on hard and I get the cheats. Customize appearance. Oh, let's do that. Oh, hell yeah.

331
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:25,500
Okay. I mean, I got to go with the fucking red shoes. That's just a fact. Shirt I want to wear.

332
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:51,699
Can I see a preview? Whoa. Oh, these get kind of funky. All right. Let's go green. Green, woodland

333
01:18:53,270 --> 01:19:10,090
and is there a green one here? Green. I got to go with the, we'll stay with the red. Cool. All right.

334
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:23,579
This is an awful drip. I'm not, I look there. I don't look somewhere. I'm like crocs. Combat

335
01:19:23,579 --> 01:19:45,880
simulator. What's that? Should I do this? Oh, I just scared myself. All right. Where's the main

336
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:56,890
missionary over here? All right. Door Institute. We lost contact with our undercover agent in this

337
01:19:56,890 --> 01:20:04,760
orazon. End of orazon. Like say the word correctly. Just do it. Prove that you can read that word.

338
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:32,520
Horizon. End of life care facility. Raid the facility and find him. I'm my own worst enemy

339
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,000
a lot of times because even if sometimes if I'm fucking around, it still doesn't matter.

340
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:55,340
Some of you will take away from this. Something's wrong with him. Can I take weapons or something?

341
01:20:55,340 --> 01:22:10,180
I like this weapon. Tried. Tried what? This was testing the game. All right. Do I have a better

342
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:19,829
gun? I have a better gun to shoot that with. Dude, come on. I don't want to wait like another two

343
01:22:19,829 --> 01:22:42,310
minutes before I can spawn again. All right. I got to disable that. Oh no. Look out. It's the guy

344
01:22:42,310 --> 01:23:04,760
with the clown shoes. Grab him. Grab him. That guy's head was made out of glass. We shouldn't even

345
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:56,060
be fighting. You now. Go. Did he say hurry the fuck up? Where are they coming from? Oh, there he is.

346
01:23:56,060 --> 01:25:52,340
Okay. Shotgun. Oh shit. Oh shit. Got him. Got him. Where'd he go? Yep. Oh, fucking. High value target.

347
01:25:52,340 --> 01:26:12,539
Jackal. I almost shot the helicopter. What's in here? Ooh, breach charges. Now do I blow

348
01:26:12,539 --> 01:27:08,539
the door? Oh, I like this song. It's dead. Oh, look out. Shoot out. Oh, in the room with the bottles.

349
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:58,810
Oh, oh, I'm in trouble here. Did he get pulled so fast? What sucked him down? He was magnetized.

350
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:37,659
Holy shit. Who else? I think we're clear. Can I go in here? Uh, where do I go from here? I came

351
01:28:37,659 --> 01:29:13,539
through here. Um, the guy you threw was a, what do you mean? Earlier. I've thrown a lot of people

352
01:29:13,539 --> 01:29:33,859
so far. Did I, I don't know where I threw that person. Did I throw in the pool? What about him?

353
01:29:33,859 --> 01:30:04,649
The glass roof. Oh, okay. That was this way. Can I not go? How do I get out here? I don't think you

354
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:09,529
do. Wait, did I actually throw the guy? Did I need a key or something from the guy I threw over there?

355
01:30:12,069 --> 01:30:25,050
That you mean over there? No, no, I don't think so. I think I just got on the wrong way. Wait,

356
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:45,500
really? Shoot all the glass? I don't think so. There's a breach charge. Uh, hold on. Keep going

357
01:30:45,500 --> 01:31:22,199
up this event. Um, can I just? Yeah. Underground. Oh, wait a minute. The walls aren't concrete. You

358
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:27,000
don't have a, you don't have an excuse this time. Yep. I may have thrown the guy that had the item

359
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,640
I needed across the wall that I can't. Is it over there? That's a breach charge right there,

360
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:48,119
isn't it? Right there. That's a charge. Okay. Well, I'll just reload. Okay. We're good.

361
01:32:05,750 --> 01:33:24,859
I'm all right. I'm going to fuck you up. All right. Where's the item? Let me in that room too.

362
01:33:24,859 --> 01:33:40,390
Let me in that room. Oh, those are my friends. Shit. I'm sorry. Well, the grenade bounced off

363
01:33:40,390 --> 01:34:02,920
the back of his head, so he's, he'll have a welt. He'll be okay. Ooh, I'll go with that. Any, uh,

364
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:38,260
customization options for the other stuff? Fold it up. Let's go. I need more gun parts. Whoa, dude.

365
01:34:38,260 --> 01:35:20,600
Whoa, hold on. Nice. Ooh, what is that? That's a sniper rifle. You were the only person left, man.

366
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:34,329
I'm going to cover me. I got to get a no scope headshot. That's the only way I'll be happy.

367
01:36:12,789 --> 01:36:28,329
Look at the DPS meters. He ain't doing shit. You all right? All right. We got to go in together

368
01:36:28,329 --> 01:36:56,569
on with me and on me. One, two, three, go. Who's saying that? Oh, it's the radio.

369
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:02,619
I thought it was one of these guys. How's everybody doing tonight? We having fun or what?

370
01:37:15,699 --> 01:37:22,819
You play video games like my dad, bro. I'm almost 40. All right. This is just the way it is. This is

371
01:37:22,819 --> 01:37:27,539
how it's going to be going forward. And I'm sorry. This is the way it is.

372
01:37:40,229 --> 01:38:29,939
He's here. He's trapped. What? No, I was going to stealth. There's one more person in here.

373
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:39,239
Yeah, whatever. Wait, this is, this is, somebody said this is Kickstarter.

374
01:38:39,239 --> 01:39:00,340
Is it? Wait, what do you mean Kickstarter? Was this game a Kickstarter? You'll never beat me.

375
01:39:00,979 --> 01:39:22,439
He just punched. That guy was jabbing me in the chin. Ooh, weapon parts, the presser.

376
01:39:24,949 --> 01:39:36,649
What about the sniper rifle? Somebody's still here. Who is it? You? It's not you. Is it, man?

377
01:39:37,529 --> 01:39:58,569
No way. Shotgun suppressor. I think that's the most counterintuitive,

378
01:39:58,569 --> 01:40:05,720
counterproductive thing to put on a shotgun. Does this actually do anything? Does it actually

379
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:20,630
work? I feel like you can't suppress the sound of a shotgun. It makes it sound cool. This person's

380
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:28,569
been looking for me this whole time. Communicating on the radio. OK, let's, we have to examine this

381
01:40:28,569 --> 01:40:53,670
guy for a little while. I wish there was a cough button. Is he in there? Is he in the what? No,

382
01:40:53,670 --> 01:41:20,949
grab him. Is he in there? What do you mean mouse five grenade? Be careful here. That doesn't

383
01:41:20,949 --> 01:41:32,619
consume your grenades, by the way. That's actually kind of crazy. I need more ammo. I'm for the boss

384
01:41:32,619 --> 01:41:37,819
fight. I'm going to use the sniper rifle only. That's the boss killer weapon for sure. 100%.

385
01:41:56,550 --> 01:42:41,380
I got one of those too. Yeah. Oh, that doesn't hurt you. It's just you two assholes left.

386
01:42:41,380 --> 01:43:09,880
God damn it. How do I get rid of these guys? Oh, oh, these guys have got concrete bodies.

387
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:28,920
You didn't hear anything. Only they had a weak spot. Yeah, I shot the

388
01:43:29,739 --> 01:43:39,529
fire extinguishers off their backs and they didn't die. I'm going to do this slow.

389
01:43:57,479 --> 01:44:41,159
Why is he laughing at me? God blow up, blow up, please blow up, please. Oh, this guy.

390
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:48,329
Seriously, dude, the guys got a jet pack on now. Hold on, I got to take a sip of this.

391
01:44:48,329 --> 01:45:02,199
Can you tackle them? I don't think those guys fall down if you tackle them too heavy.

392
01:45:02,199 --> 01:45:39,430
All right. I'm just going in. Fuck it. Fuck everybody in this room. Watch out. I'm going to

393
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:45,659
hide in here for a sec. Oh my God. They get, they're going to get hit by those. They're going to be

394
01:45:45,659 --> 01:45:58,489
stupid and they're going to walk into that. Watch this. What am I hitting in the way?

395
01:45:59,289 --> 01:46:05,880
There ain't nothing in the way. What? You just aggroed more enemies.

396
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:19,779
All right. These guys are really hard. I got to kill those guys first. I thought he was going to

397
01:46:19,779 --> 01:46:58,220
walk in and walk backwards and blow up. Okay. This one, I took that guy's helmet off too.

398
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:50,119
All right. We're good. Better. Oh my God. There we go. That's better. Show yourself.

399
01:47:50,119 --> 01:48:13,829
That guy was just talking. Okay. He's dead. I need this health on them. No, I got,

400
01:48:13,829 --> 01:48:21,750
I got a full recharge. I'm good. Is there any other ammo I can grab here though?

401
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:38,359
I feel like I need it bad. I guess I can just take this and run around. Does this help me?

402
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:48,020
Pistol's really good. The pistol does seem really good. Doesn't it? All right. I got enough.

403
01:48:48,020 --> 01:49:33,590
Now don't die in here. Where's this guy? One more over there.

404
01:49:36,220 --> 01:50:04,390
There's nowhere to go. Okay. Don't run around like that here. No way. I want to, why can I not?

405
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:19,770
I can't grab them. I was trying to grab them. Oh no. Charles. Oh no. What the hell was that?

406
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:38,899
Somebody rock across the tripwire. I, I don't know. All right. This is going to be hard now.

407
01:50:42,229 --> 01:50:55,479
Who's here? Oh, I don't think I made out better than they did.

408
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:23,899
He's still alive. Oh my God. I thought that was the doorway. I thought that was the doorway.

409
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:35,130
I thought this was a hallway. I thought that was the ground and this was the wall.

410
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:56,470
Wiley Coyote bit. Yeah, seriously. Wait, there's still people here. Oh, that's the jackal. All

411
01:51:56,470 --> 01:52:06,439
right. I got to be ready. Oh shit. They're going to throw grenades in here. I'm in so much trouble.

412
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:15,270
Oh God. What the hell does he have for a weapon?

413
01:52:32,939 --> 01:52:52,359
I'm still sliding. It's not going to hurt me, right? Got him. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

414
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:11,579
All right. I had it last time. I'm good. I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing. I know

415
01:53:11,579 --> 01:53:34,710
what I'm doing. You're going to think I'm stupid for this, but it's not stupid. Trust me. All right.

416
01:53:34,710 --> 01:54:26,250
Now. Oh, this is hard. All right. Get me in the room at least. Oh Lord. I got nothing to do. I,

417
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:51,529
holy shit. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to go invisible and I'm going to run behind everybody.

418
01:54:51,529 --> 01:55:09,100
I wish I didn't throw all three of my grenades like a dummy. There he is. He's dead. Oh,

419
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:34,779
that's so many people. Stop, please, please, please, please, please. All right. Stay right here.

420
01:55:36,819 --> 01:55:48,300
I'm all right for now. Where are they? Are they in the room? I think they're in the far room.

421
01:55:51,739 --> 01:56:11,619
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. I think I killed one.

422
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:42,810
Whoa. That guy was just whispering to himself. I got it. There we are. These big rooms with all

423
01:56:44,420 --> 01:57:02,659
the... Those are fun. Sliding under the flare was dope. Yeah, it's fun. I didn't even pick this up.

424
01:57:22,979 --> 01:57:27,140
Hey, do that bit again where you get really mad and have a death counter that's really high.

425
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:32,460
No, you can only do that so many times. What's going on in here?

426
01:57:45,189 --> 01:58:07,350
All it costs is a bit of your kindness. The Pandora Institute. I value... Oh wait, we're not done.

427
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:42,659
We're not done. Hey, I'm in here. You gonna walk over here? Hey, what the hell? What the

428
01:58:42,659 --> 01:58:47,699
fuck was that guy in scuba gear? That guy was in a full scuba outfit. What the hell happened?

429
01:58:47,699 --> 01:59:00,520
That reminded me of... I feel like I queued up a bunch of actions. We all queued up actions at

430
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:05,000
the same time and we all did them at the same time. That was like a strategy game. I feel like

431
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,539
I was playing XCOM for a second. Everyone just does all their moves at the same time. Is that

432
01:59:10,539 --> 01:59:47,909
how XCOM works? I ain't gonna let you kill me. No way. Stop throwing grenades. How many grenades

433
01:59:47,909 --> 02:00:19,210
do you guys have? Cease fire. That's right. Let's talk about it. Whoa! I snapped his neck. Are we

434
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:33,460
all done here? Is that it now? Can I keep going? Holy shit. Take this. He should have just shot me

435
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:42,329
in the head. At some point you don't scream before you're about to do something. Take this is

436
02:00:42,329 --> 02:00:52,340
probably what you shouldn't be yelling. Take this. And then he goes for a kick. Is this kind of

437
02:00:52,340 --> 02:01:16,119
fucked up? What happened here? One of those times I'm gonna get roundhouse kicked in the head and

438
02:01:16,119 --> 02:01:55,369
it's gonna kill me and I'm gonna scream. Whoa. What's going on here? Okay. Now the music's

439
02:01:55,369 --> 02:02:11,050
getting kind of strange. That was a scoring moment. It really was. You guys are right.

440
02:02:11,050 --> 02:02:41,130
Instead of jumping off a cliff you can jump into his arms. What? Oh dear. 106.

441
02:02:42,010 --> 02:02:49,210
Man of the hour. Oh hello. I'll get that elevator unlocked for you. Are you gonna die

442
02:02:49,210 --> 02:02:56,300
right when this opens? I got it. According to the schematics this elevator is going to take you

443
02:02:56,300 --> 02:03:00,939
straight to the basement. It's probably flooded with grunts right now but that shouldn't be a

444
02:03:00,939 --> 02:03:08,180
problem for a super soldier. I gotta get back to my team. Good luck. All right well good luck.

445
02:03:08,979 --> 02:03:30,199
Thanks for the help. Not dead. Yeah. Still alive. Still going. I'm just waiting.

446
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Something's gonna. Yeah. Come on. It's an elevator in one of these kinds of games.

447
02:03:35,000 --> 02:04:01,449
Of course something bad's gonna happen. What was that? Do not use elevators. Well I just used one.

448
02:04:01,449 --> 02:04:19,659
That's a lot of blood. Don't use elevators. Don't use the elevators. Do not use the elevators. Do

449
02:04:19,659 --> 02:04:29,539
not use. Take only one. Don't be selfish. What are these? Water? 550 for a water. What the hell

450
02:04:29,539 --> 02:04:59,060
is going on here? Yeah. Amusement park prices. We're gonna disable this door. Can I grab that?

451
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:47,050
Oh. Take the health. Can I get through here? Oh health. Maximum over time. Okay. Wait. Didn't

452
02:05:47,050 --> 02:05:57,850
tell. Patient exposure. Wait hold on. The effects on a human subject were catastrophic. Upon exposure

453
02:05:57,850 --> 02:06:04,409
the subject's DNA was rapidly rewritten causing grotesque mutations and physical deformations.

454
02:06:05,050 --> 02:06:09,689
The subject was immediately transformed. Its skin took on a sickly green hue becoming blistered

455
02:06:09,689 --> 02:06:43,100
and swollen oozing a thick green liquid. Okay. Okay. Can I open this door? Abandoned move to

456
02:06:43,100 --> 02:07:15,770
Maxwell. Darwin. Okay. Oh. That was so funny. Thanks. I really was hoping it was gonna.

457
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:35,539
Am I the visitor? You know what? I actually do prefer the pistol. Somebody said it. I actually

458
02:07:35,539 --> 02:07:45,829
do want it instead. To Dr. Clark. Keep this off radio. It's impossible. Sterilization impossible.

459
02:07:45,829 --> 02:07:51,750
Extraction impossible. We're already compromised. Relay orders to men. Enable lockdown. Procedure

460
02:07:51,750 --> 02:08:06,020
disabled. Are we gonna get like a Satan face here? I would imagine a Satan face is gonna show up in

461
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:52,300
a second. We got one guy here. The one guy that had to come in here. What is that? A giant bat?

462
02:08:52,300 --> 02:09:00,300
Okay. This just turned into a different game. I love how he's perfectly framed right here too.

463
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:08,260
He runs right in. Right center frame. Points at us. I see him. That guy's guaranteed to die.

464
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:25,819
Guaranteed. God damn it. All right. This just became a scary game. Conflicted scientist email.

465
02:09:25,819 --> 02:09:34,390
The reality of our research pushes boundaries of medicine and science. It is essential that we do

466
02:09:34,390 --> 02:09:42,659
not let personal things get in the way. Developable goals to save lives. Okay. Maybe I shouldn't have

467
02:09:42,659 --> 02:10:06,840
taken the pistol. I want to go see the thing. I want to slow-mo that thing. Keep out. Does the

468
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:36,539
game have photo mode? I don't think it does. I don't think so. Did you just get me? A new special

469
02:10:36,539 --> 02:11:02,170
infected or something? Okay. I was not gonna stand close to that. No fucking chance. It looked like

470
02:11:02,170 --> 02:11:26,069
it was coming through the wall at me already. Mountain Dew Overtown. Doing that. Scary. Hmm.

471
02:11:26,149 --> 02:11:56,920
Are we screaming? Sometimes during my use sound like SpongeBob. That's all right. Oh god. All

472
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:11,939
right. This is now infected. Got a mutated alien world or something. Jesus. Oh my god. Okay. This

473
02:12:11,939 --> 02:12:42,949
is. I love how they bumped into each other though. That was fun. Get out of here. Wait. Can I grab

474
02:12:42,949 --> 02:13:19,220
the enemy? Oh my god. Am I not killing them? Am I not killing them? I don't think they're dying.

475
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:48,090
Way to go. I'm playing Cod Zombies now. Sorry. I play it like Cod Zombies. Fuck you idiot. Why

476
02:13:48,090 --> 02:14:15,909
are you doing that? Stop. They can't be right next to you. God damn it. Get it together. And

477
02:14:15,909 --> 02:14:35,689
that works. I got an idea. Ready? That kind of works. Don't do it again. I can't be trusted.

478
02:14:51,579 --> 02:15:11,640
Okay. I'm good. My accolades. All right. I think this only. They just keep spawning. So

479
02:15:19,699 --> 02:15:47,640
good bro actually that time. Jesus. I didn't even know I threw it. I didn't even know I threw that.

480
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:59,340
There's a lot of enemies. I don't even have enough bullets to kill all these things. All right. All

481
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:08,329
right. All right. All right. Okay. Everybody relax. I'm going to take a sip of my pee. I'm not going

482
02:16:08,329 --> 02:16:16,550
to sound like letting the air out of a balloon really slowly. I'm going to just do it. I'm going

483
02:16:16,550 --> 02:17:59,030
to get focused and I'm going to do it. Oh my God. I missed. Oh. Somebody said, are those

484
02:17:59,030 --> 02:18:25,219
trip hangs? Why is this guy just sitting here? What the fuck was that guy doing? I got it. All

485
02:18:25,219 --> 02:18:48,549
right. What was that? You got to be shitting me. Really? Let me collect. I feel like there's a lot

486
02:18:48,549 --> 02:18:59,959
of stuff I can get now. Can I do more damage on the handgun? I think those. Yeah. I think those

487
02:18:59,959 --> 02:19:16,620
were trepang too. Those trepangs. I thought that was a giant laptop. It's you dude. You're the

488
02:19:16,620 --> 02:20:07,450
trepang. Okay. I think I. Wait. No, I like the shotgun. Somebody was here. Go to the door. Blood

489
02:20:07,450 --> 02:20:44,790
or no blood? I hear it. It's going to be another huge wave and I have no ammo. Thank God. What's

490
02:20:44,790 --> 02:21:09,190
that? Oh, it's a shotgun. Is it better to take the regular shotgun or this one? Take the suppressor

491
02:21:09,190 --> 02:21:22,760
off. Fuck the suppressor. Yeah. Suppressor lowers damage. I don't want to be damaged. It's the same

492
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:35,159
gun with layout. I'll take it. My mom wants to know if there's swearing in this game. I'm not

493
02:21:35,159 --> 02:21:41,510
allowed to watch if there's swearing. I think there's this swearing in the game, but I think

494
02:21:41,510 --> 02:21:54,579
more importantly, people's heads are exploding. So I think that's also something to keep in mind.

495
02:21:54,579 --> 02:22:25,979
Jesus. It is a bat. Wait, we're just. There's. It's scary. What? Is it behind me? Is it right

496
02:22:25,979 --> 02:22:40,520
behind me? There's no way anybody can do that. Oh, what do I go? How do I get out of here?

497
02:22:41,159 --> 02:23:11,799
I'm sorry. I'm going to, I'm going to keep running. I'm not going to stop. Still alive.

498
02:23:11,799 --> 02:23:38,360
Ooh. He has another gigantic coin. That's not what she meant. Okay. I thought she said, you know,

499
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:45,450
she said, destroy the subject. I'm like, okay, I guess does that mean, all right, where are we

500
02:23:45,450 --> 02:24:00,500
going to go? You know what? I'm just noticing right now. My mouse is like, look at my mouse.

501
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:12,459
That's strange. Isn't it? I didn't even notice that till right now. Can you guys see my mouse

502
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:24,090
on the top and left of the screen right now? Or is that only coming up for me? Jesus. I'm

503
02:24:24,090 --> 02:24:29,000
sorry. I probably scared you, but I scared myself. It is there. Hold on. Maybe I should put it like

504
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:56,280
exclusive full screen. It's not doing it anymore. But why did zoomed in over here? Hold on. Huh.

505
02:24:59,260 --> 02:25:06,700
Wow. Is it doing it still? No, that was really strange. Has it been happening the whole time?

506
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:20,540
I think it has been. Not really. I didn't notice. No, it might've been. Okay. Well,

507
02:25:20,540 --> 02:25:24,920
if you have a mouse show up on your screen, then just go exclusive full screen. It'll fix it.

508
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:35,530
All right. Now I have to destroy the subject. Anything else in here?

509
02:25:37,379 --> 02:25:45,620
No. Wow. That's a lot of stuff. They are preparing me for a gigantic boss fight.

510
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:58,709
So let's go ahead and take, I want sniper rifle, sniper rifle, shotgun. This reminds me of that

511
02:25:58,709 --> 02:26:07,909
VR game that stir and I played where our arms were wicked long and we were able to like put our arms

512
02:26:07,909 --> 02:26:15,620
like behind our backs and like shoot ourselves in the back. We were like aiming the guns behind

513
02:26:15,620 --> 02:26:36,219
ourselves. Oh, that was so fun. That game was so fun. That is so funny. Okay. Um, I can hear the

514
02:26:36,219 --> 02:26:47,450
thing screaming in the other room. What about the sniper? Why would you pick a horror game for a

515
02:26:47,450 --> 02:26:59,639
chill stream? Well, chill stream in the sense that I'm kind of just playing, just hanging out.

516
02:26:59,639 --> 02:27:09,290
All right. I'm ready to go. Can you do, can you akimbo shotguns? I, can you, can you do well?

517
02:27:09,290 --> 02:27:23,030
I don't think you can. Maybe not yet. You can? Not yet. Okay. All right. Uh, I think that does it.

518
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:29,270
Maybe is there any more grenades I can grab or no? He's, he's waiting for me to come in the room.

519
02:27:29,270 --> 02:28:33,049
Okay. Boss area. I think I can hear his wings flapping running around up here. Shit. Anything

520
02:28:33,049 --> 02:28:41,659
though? His brain. That dude, that's their full brain. Their whole ass brain is out of their head.

521
02:28:41,659 --> 02:28:48,729
Not even in any more than one piece, their whole brain, the entire brain that was surgically

522
02:28:48,729 --> 02:29:13,739
removed. That was not exploded or anything. Okay. Let's do it. All right. Cue the music.

523
02:29:13,739 --> 02:29:20,620
Secure it. You want to read it? Get those laser gates turned on as soon as possible. Just heard

524
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:25,719
from the eggheads. Just one of those things get inside a reactor. This whole place is going up

525
02:29:25,719 --> 02:29:58,549
in flames. Okay. Well, let's do it. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Here it comes. Maybe not

526
02:29:58,549 --> 02:30:49,340
yet. Maybe. Throw them into the reactor. Is that a rocket launcher or something? No. Is it? No.

527
02:30:55,819 --> 02:31:38,409
Okay. Let's do it. All right. Got one. Okay. Wait, this health over here. Just throw them out the

528
02:31:38,409 --> 02:32:06,340
window. Did I? Damn it. I think I walked over it accidentally. Nope. Okay. There's like three or

529
02:32:06,340 --> 02:32:47,420
four more of these. Another one in there? Oh my goodness. Oh, this one up here. All right. Get out.

530
02:32:47,420 --> 02:33:19,180
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Oh, oh shit. I have to run. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just had to see.

531
02:33:19,989 --> 02:33:24,149
It's going to be a checkpoint right there. It doesn't. Oh no, it's not. Don't do that again.

532
02:33:26,260 --> 02:33:58,309
Don't do that again. That's me shooting the gun. Shut up. Shut up. I didn't throw that guy.

533
02:33:58,309 --> 02:34:21,110
That guy jumped in on his own. I didn't throw that guy. That guy. Jesus. Get over it. Somebody

534
02:34:21,110 --> 02:34:52,149
just. Okay. Go. I won't be an idiot this time. I promise. All right. I'm up. Go, go, go, go.

535
02:34:56,379 --> 02:35:00,860
Slide, slide, slide, slide, slide. You fucking McDonald's shoe motherfucker. Let's go.

536
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:07,909
It's right behind me. That was actually terrifying. Where do I go? Where do I go?

537
02:35:07,909 --> 02:35:32,520
Oh, we're fine. I don't know where to go. Chill stream. Hurry, get it. Fuck you.

538
02:36:00,520 --> 02:37:04,500
Open, open, open. Where even is it? Man, that was crazy. Geez. Am I good? Did I make it? What's

539
02:37:04,500 --> 02:37:33,479
the name of the game? Trey Pang 2. I'm alive. I made it. I have a feeling that thing's not dead.

540
02:37:33,479 --> 02:38:02,260
Raven's on his way now. Maybe I did. Thanks guys. Okay. Let's get it. Don't walk right into it,

541
02:38:02,260 --> 02:38:50,360
dude. What are you guys doing? What? Where to go? Where to go? Where to go? Goodbye. Where is it

542
02:38:50,360 --> 02:39:39,399
going? Jesus. Got him. He's staring at me. There you are. There you are. There you are. All right.

543
02:39:39,399 --> 02:40:04,059
Now I'm going to run this way and here we go. I want to get close as hell. Oh my God. I don't

544
02:40:04,059 --> 02:40:51,219
have anyone slow down. Chill stream. Chill stream vibes. That's right. What difficulty? This is on

545
02:40:51,219 --> 02:41:24,809
hard. I'm sorry. It was a good shot though. I have to pee. I'll be right back and we'll keep going.

546
02:41:24,809 --> 02:41:39,340
I did unlock infinite stamina as a cheat. All progression will be saved on easy difficulty

547
02:41:39,340 --> 02:46:21,209
regardless of your current difficulty. I'll be right back. See you in a minute. You guys ready

548
02:46:21,290 --> 02:46:53,670
to go back? Continue. So what? What's next? Music's kind of louder than everybody else.

549
02:46:54,229 --> 02:47:10,260
I keep thinking it's going to open automatically. It just isn't. I like sniper rifle a lot.

550
02:47:10,819 --> 02:48:10,250
Okay. Okay. I tried to run. Is this a weapons cache? No. It's like a reactor down here.

551
02:48:11,049 --> 02:48:14,860
It's fucked up.

552
02:48:14,860 --> 02:48:54,440
Oh, he's so funny. He even blew up right there. Do the double drop kick wrestling move to it.

553
02:48:54,440 --> 02:49:27,530
Press the button. Very well protected. I love somebody who just writes stop. Stop it. Stop that.

554
02:49:28,170 --> 02:50:00,340
Are you even going to do that times 10 speed with the wild stream? Um, it's a good in theory joke,

555
02:50:00,340 --> 02:50:22,649
but in practice, I'm not sure. It means no. Okay. Listening memories. She's not telling you

556
02:50:22,649 --> 02:50:43,620
everything. Data package redacted. Upload complete. Not telling you everything. All right. Well,

557
02:50:43,620 --> 02:50:49,059
interesting. Is this the only thing you're going to play tonight? I wanted to, I was going to do

558
02:50:49,059 --> 02:50:57,989
browser game stuff, but this game is not very long from what I've heard. I heard this whole

559
02:50:57,989 --> 02:51:05,530
campaign is somewhere around like four to seven hours long and I'm kind of into it. So I want to

560
02:51:05,530 --> 02:51:27,049
play it. We'll do browser stuff at the time. Don't worry. What's all that? Main story is about four

561
02:51:27,049 --> 02:51:57,299
and a half to five main and extra is seven. That makes sense. Hello. I want to get back in there.

562
02:51:57,299 --> 02:52:14,950
All right. Appearance. This is the simulator. Go to the gun range to get guns. This is going to be

563
02:52:14,950 --> 02:52:21,799
at least an eight hour stream. Well, how many, what do we have here? We've got one, two, we did

564
02:52:21,799 --> 02:52:29,430
these two, three, four, but it's probably like five or six main missions. Yeah. See side mission.

565
02:52:29,430 --> 02:52:39,139
I think we can get this all done in one stream. I'm not going to go as fast as I can. I'm not going

566
02:52:39,139 --> 02:52:44,950
to just blow through it. It's definitely possible to do the main ones and then maybe one or two of

567
02:52:44,950 --> 02:52:59,899
the side ones. Hack the servers and steal classified information. Hack servers in Horizon's

568
02:52:59,899 --> 02:53:05,899
highly secure data center. Covered files from the Pandora Institute show Horizon is collaborating

569
02:53:05,899 --> 02:53:13,670
with cultists. Cultists investigate the extent of their collaboration and destroy the cult.

570
02:53:13,670 --> 02:53:25,370
Side missions are wave defense missions mostly. Okay. We'll do the main ones, but I do want to

571
02:53:25,930 --> 02:53:49,430
I don't think I unlocked very much. Let's just go for it. Is this your favorite game ever? Check

572
02:53:49,430 --> 02:54:33,510
the gun range. We got rifle, flash bangs. Hey, those are fun. That's why you're the super soldier.

573
02:54:33,510 --> 02:54:55,110
Who's talking to me? Have some fun. Huh? Oh, thanks. All right. What do I want to bring? I'm

574
02:54:55,110 --> 02:55:01,139
I like the, can I take the sniper rifle? I want the sniper rifle. It's my favorite gun in game

575
02:55:02,180 --> 02:55:23,190
and that's why it's too bad I missed. Shotgun's fun, but we'll do SMG as well.

576
02:55:24,069 --> 02:55:47,909
Resetting the range. It's fine. Folded stock and suppressor. Yeah. What does it sound like?

577
02:55:48,549 --> 02:56:04,170
That sounds awesome. I love the way this sounds. All right. I'm ready. I guess I can take

578
02:56:04,809 --> 02:56:09,290
armor and flashbangs. Why not? I get to keep these when I go on the mission, right?

579
02:56:09,290 --> 02:56:23,260
Sounds like a paint gun. It does a little video. TF2 sniper. Maybe that's why I like it. It sounds

580
02:56:23,260 --> 02:56:34,459
like that. All right, let's go outside. There's a bunch of fakes. You'll see what I'm talking about.

581
02:56:34,459 --> 02:56:41,209
Does folding the stock give any advantage in a game like this? It's not like the gun is going

582
02:56:41,209 --> 02:56:51,700
to bump into shit with the stock out. I think it was what? Recoil shooting, right? Here we go.

583
02:56:56,329 --> 02:57:09,139
Faster reload. This is an interesting mission. Like a gigantic mansion or something.

584
02:57:09,780 --> 02:57:17,430
Dwarfic Castle, Yorkshire, United Kingdom. Kill the cultist leader. Kill or capture

585
02:57:17,430 --> 02:57:48,899
the scientist Dr. Kramer. Interesting. Plenty of ammo. I'm going to turn the light off. Okay.

586
02:57:48,899 --> 02:58:01,829
Going down. I already have that weapon, right? It's a presser. Maybe I'll put it on the sniper.

587
02:58:04,540 --> 02:58:31,829
Yeah. What game should I play? There's not much time left. This one. That's a lazy answer.

588
02:58:33,620 --> 02:58:41,020
Is it though? This is a new game that just came out. It's very good. It's action packed.

589
02:58:41,020 --> 02:59:12,500
It's not that long. I think that was a perfect answer. Okay. This brain came out. It's full

590
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:49,750
brain. His full brain is indestructible. What the hell was that? Eat shit. Oops.

591
03:00:09,379 --> 03:00:16,549
Where are they? Where are they? What did that guy just do?

592
03:00:27,239 --> 03:01:02,780
All right. That was pretty sick. I'm not going to lie. You're going to land here. What kind

593
03:01:02,780 --> 03:01:17,829
of weapons do these guys have? Shotguns. Oh, that one looks different. No, it's not.

594
03:01:18,309 --> 03:01:40,979
Enforcer 106. Take the brain with you. It's like left for dead gnome mission. Are they here?

595
03:01:40,979 --> 03:02:15,290
Nobody here? Game looks sick. I would tell you it is sick. Didn't tell. Beware. Like those you

596
03:02:15,290 --> 03:02:27,180
destroy, you too shall become. I'm having fun with it so far. I think the only real complaint

597
03:02:27,180 --> 03:02:34,780
that you could have is it's not that long from everything that I've been shown, but they're

598
03:02:34,780 --> 03:02:42,950
there. This is it right here. Can I get this right now? It's this guy right here. This is the guy.

599
03:02:44,020 --> 03:03:15,770
That's the guy. Oh, wait. Yeah. Also, I'm also a proponent of length is not determined if a

600
03:03:15,770 --> 03:03:23,850
game is any good. I would rather have a really fun, really polished, like six to 10 hour game

601
03:03:23,850 --> 03:03:47,879
than a just junk filled slog of like a 20 plus hour game. Where are they? I didn't aggro the main

602
03:03:47,879 --> 03:04:02,700
guy. So I guess I can kind of keep sneaking around. Nobody saw me come in here. He hates Elden Ring.

603
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:09,670
What? Here's the hold on. Elden Ring is like one of the best video games ever made. Besides millennia

604
03:04:09,670 --> 03:04:24,940
and we're done. Pre patch. Today marks my first day as an apprentice. I've left my old life behind,

605
03:04:24,940 --> 03:04:31,180
including my job at Horizon. I made this decision not just for myself, but my wife Martha and our

606
03:04:31,180 --> 03:04:39,590
unborn child. I believe that the patriarch offers, the patriarch prefers something not that my old

607
03:04:39,590 --> 03:05:14,649
life could not true. Somebody else can read. All right. They're here somewhere. That guy's still

608
03:05:14,649 --> 03:05:27,620
alive. I only shot that guy in the groin. I could, that guy threw up in the balcony, did like four

609
03:05:27,620 --> 03:05:42,069
Tony Hawk pro skater moves. Oh, I fucked him up so bad. He's up there. I don't think he knows what's

610
03:05:42,069 --> 03:07:03,690
going on. All right. I'm going to keep going. His whole brain again. Got you. You dead? Oh God.

611
03:07:05,879 --> 03:07:30,379
I'll try it one more time. Printer music? What does a printer music mean? It sounds like, what do you,

612
03:07:30,379 --> 03:08:13,059
hold on. Listen, listen, listen. Oh shit. I still got it when it's still in the air. I killed that

613
03:08:13,059 --> 03:08:30,899
guy. Okay. This sound, this you saying is a printer? Like an old printer? I guess maybe a little

614
03:08:36,440 --> 03:08:46,329
Intel. Resets of 12 reps of pushups using the edge of a table. Resets of 12 reps of pull-ups using

615
03:08:46,329 --> 03:08:53,059
the edge of a table. Resets of 12 reps of lunges using a stack of books. Resets of 12 reps of

616
03:08:53,059 --> 03:09:02,340
military press using heavy books. That's how you become Saitama. So you become strong. That's the

617
03:09:02,340 --> 03:09:11,350
secret. Masks and robes must remain on during PT. We do not stretch or warm up. We train as we fight.

618
03:09:14,579 --> 03:09:38,840
It actually is bald. All right. Where am I going? I think it's this way. I'm now five days into my

619
03:09:38,840 --> 03:09:43,959
apprenticeship at the cult hall. And I must say the schedule is quite rigorous. Rising at the crack

620
03:09:43,959 --> 03:09:50,200
of dawn, praying for four hours, fasting and so on. It takes some getting used to, but I believe

621
03:09:50,200 --> 03:09:54,120
it is for the greater good. The hall itself is quite impressive, but where are all the women

622
03:09:54,120 --> 03:09:59,079
and children? Martha's not enjoying herself much here, but I'm sure she will accustom herself in

623
03:09:59,079 --> 03:10:19,540
due time. I thought this was Thanos. Are you? What the hell? Are you? I'm going to die from this

624
03:10:19,540 --> 03:10:28,020
motherfucker. He's going to kill me. What the fuck? This guy's super powered. That guy is super human.

625
03:10:28,659 --> 03:10:35,700
He was literally unrecognizably fucking burnt. That. Okay. That was terrifying.

626
03:10:41,049 --> 03:11:08,700
Holy shit. That guy almost killed me. What the fuck was that? He's stuck on them.

627
03:11:19,159 --> 03:11:32,229
That was fucked. That was so loud. That hurt my head. We're just knocking a ton of shit over,

628
03:11:32,229 --> 03:11:53,930
aren't we? Farewell. Farewell, brother. I once got to get killed by a chair, don't you?

629
03:11:54,649 --> 03:12:20,950
I love this game. It's great. Okay. Now where was I going?

630
03:12:21,670 --> 03:12:44,149
Briefcase. Please unfold this for the love of God. I'm fine. It's good. That's fine.

631
03:12:44,149 --> 03:13:17,670
There it is. All right. What are you doing? The BLT stream? Uh, hold on. I,

632
03:13:17,670 --> 03:13:35,399
hold on. I gotta pay attention to where I'm going. Uh, shit. Where am I going? I came down this way,

633
03:13:36,440 --> 03:13:41,780
right? Yeah. Is this right? Yeah, this is right.

634
03:13:42,340 --> 03:14:13,430
By the patriarchs. They're all still screaming. Hold on. I can get it.

635
03:14:45,459 --> 03:15:26,379
You alive? This guy's so burnt. All right. I've had enough of that. Oh Jesus. They're spinning.

636
03:15:36,280 --> 03:15:42,760
Oh, they were in like a carousel. That out of control carousel. Holding on

637
03:15:42,760 --> 03:15:47,739
for their lives while the thing spun a million miles per hour. They're on a roller coaster.

638
03:15:49,559 --> 03:16:27,530
Oh, I'm just going all the way. All right. Die. They're still alive. I'm just running up these

639
03:16:27,530 --> 03:16:45,399
fucking stairs. Get away from me. Get out of here. Stop. That's the guy. That's the fucking boss.

640
03:16:46,040 --> 03:17:05,020
This is the boss. This is fucking mayhem. All right. I'm just going up there.

641
03:17:05,020 --> 03:17:52,360
Fuck it. I don't care. Follow me while I care. Come on. Oh Jesus. I have to relax because I'm,

642
03:17:52,360 --> 03:18:11,219
I'm going to like fucking freak. Okay. Let's go. All right. Now go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

643
03:18:11,219 --> 03:18:29,940
That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. He's right here. Dude. What's your head

644
03:18:29,940 --> 03:18:39,479
made out of, dude? What is your head made out of? Did I get him? Is he dead? Oh shit. They're all

645
03:18:39,479 --> 03:18:56,469
still here. I, oh my, wait, go, go, go, go, go. I killed him. I got him. I got him. I got him.

646
03:18:57,510 --> 03:19:14,889
I don't know. Just go, just go, go, go. Just go. Just go. Just go. I already killed the guy.

647
03:19:53,209 --> 03:20:24,709
Wait, he's still alive. Where is this guy? But he has magical spells. Whoa. You got a different

648
03:20:24,709 --> 03:20:38,329
gun and this thing looks crazy. That was fucking insane. That was a lot of fun.

649
03:20:38,329 --> 03:21:06,819
Man, get your hands up. Did we get him? God damn it. I can't shoot through this.

650
03:21:06,819 --> 03:21:15,879
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. You sorry suck of shit. How do I get out of here?

651
03:21:15,879 --> 03:21:58,100
How do I get out of here? How do I get out of here? Oh, they come to you. I can tell.

652
03:22:01,299 --> 03:22:20,200
Okay. I got it. Can I do something with this gun? Two smart gun. That's funny. Kind of add

653
03:22:20,200 --> 03:22:57,379
an ammo for this thing. Swap it. A ham, a full ham thing is still bloody. Can I eat it? Is that

654
03:22:57,379 --> 03:23:59,000
gas coming in the room? Somebody said to do that. It was kind of funny. Somebody said, get really

655
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:37,989
close to a wall and throw them in. Kind of funny. Look at all this literature. Yeah. What are you

656
03:24:37,989 --> 03:24:45,139
doing? That just didn't feel like shooting the gun because it was going to take too long to rev

657
03:24:45,139 --> 03:24:49,750
up the gun, which was two or three seconds too long. And I thought I could just jump over it.

658
03:24:49,750 --> 03:25:30,409
That's a bad place to spawn. There's a fight going on here. Here I come.

659
03:25:51,030 --> 03:26:35,899
That was some Banjo Kazooie shit there. We're good. Don't do that. You just killed somebody

660
03:26:35,899 --> 03:27:14,120
on your own team. Why are you playing an FPS? You've changed, bro. Oh shit. Somebody's talking

661
03:27:14,120 --> 03:27:42,860
next to my head. That was weird. How was that? Did I just bounce back into it? I was going to say,

662
03:27:42,860 --> 03:28:05,930
please don't. I need ammo. Ages ago, I left my old life as a soldier behind in search of something

663
03:28:05,930 --> 03:28:09,819
greater. I joined not only because of my beliefs, but also because it gave me a sense of belonging

664
03:28:09,819 --> 03:28:51,719
and fulfillment. Oh, sorry. I had a drink halfway through that auto fully automatic pistol. I'm

665
03:28:51,719 --> 03:29:03,530
going to take it because I want to try it. All right. Where's game progress up here?

666
03:29:03,530 --> 03:30:46,840
Where are you at? Where are you at? Oh, he's in this room. Who? What? What? What's that?

667
03:30:50,040 --> 03:31:08,059
Like an automatic shotgun. What is this thing? Fresh. What's up?

668
03:31:08,219 --> 03:31:45,290
Let's go. Who's on my team? Hey, you on my team? Are we up? No, we're not. Who's on my team?

669
03:31:46,010 --> 03:31:57,860
What was that? That was a grenade. This is a grenade. Sure. All right. I get it. Who's on my team?

670
03:31:57,860 --> 03:32:25,129
Hey, you're on my team. My precious. I get it now. All right. Give me that grenade launcher.

671
03:32:25,610 --> 03:32:38,360
That's us. All right. Here we go.

672
03:32:45,219 --> 03:33:29,819
Oh, look at this. How like orcs or something, but it's slowed down. I feel like playing

673
03:33:29,819 --> 03:33:48,120
fucking Daisy right now. Just get him going in and kill him. Just like, can I get him?

674
03:33:48,120 --> 03:33:58,809
He's across the map. Can I hit him? Oh, I'm not very good. This guy's still talking.

675
03:33:58,809 --> 03:34:19,860
And in my absence. What? Oh, who's with me? I'm bringing one pistol in here.

676
03:34:21,639 --> 03:34:29,739
Is the neti pot stream after this? What on earth are you talking about? What are you talking about?

677
03:34:29,739 --> 03:34:37,219
I used a neti pot once when I was sick, like two, three years ago. What on earth are you referring

678
03:34:37,219 --> 03:35:02,979
to? This is goofy. I like it. This is a goofy weapon now. I like it a lot. This thing's empty.

679
03:35:03,700 --> 03:35:29,299
You are goofy. Hey, it's fun. What's that beep? I'm not standing on a landmine, right? I need a gun.

680
03:35:29,940 --> 03:35:47,930
I'm not trying to be an asshole here. I'm sorry. I'm just, you're stuck on me.

681
03:35:47,930 --> 03:36:11,719
I want to sneak up behind this guy and just, just to whip him in the back of the head once.

682
03:36:11,719 --> 03:36:38,299
Can I do that? I hope I can. Bro, you had your volume up way too loud. That's like you thought

683
03:36:38,299 --> 03:37:05,610
you were turning it off, but you turned it all the way up. Ooh. Can I do anything? Incendiary.

684
03:37:08,379 --> 03:37:31,979
Incendiary what? Shotgun? Let's take a look at the intel. Dr. Kramer. I'm now supervising

685
03:37:31,979 --> 03:37:36,139
the cult experiments. It's my job to gather data and assess if there's anything usable in

686
03:37:36,139 --> 03:37:41,500
their insane methods. I report every 30 minutes if I miss one, or if my heart rate monitor goes

687
03:37:41,500 --> 03:37:48,329
too high, a black ops team will arrive and kill everyone, leaving no traces behind. I must regain.

688
03:37:48,969 --> 03:37:54,489
I must remain objective. Cultists are fanatical and delusional, but there's a chance that some

689
03:37:54,489 --> 03:38:05,459
of the methods may prove useful. If your heart rate goes too high. So I can't exercise. I can't

690
03:38:05,459 --> 03:38:17,350
watch. I can't watch tenant. I can't, um, I mean, there's a lot of things I can't do. It's kind of

691
03:38:17,350 --> 03:38:25,940
unfortunate. You can't. All right, we're going to move on. Incendiary on shotgun. Oh, I don't

692
03:38:25,940 --> 03:38:39,559
think I can do it. Can I? Oh my goodness. I can. How did I not see that? Thank you. This might be

693
03:38:39,559 --> 03:39:11,639
hit. He's dead. Jesus. Uh, shotgun or, I mean, grenade launch. Let's just, whatever. I'm doing

694
03:39:11,639 --> 03:39:26,299
grenade launcher. Can I pick up these knives? Ooh, cool. I'm beginning to feel skeptical about

695
03:39:26,299 --> 03:39:31,579
the cult experiments. It's clear that their methods are dangerous and unsound and I've yet to see

696
03:39:31,659 --> 03:39:41,579
any real progress. Perhaps they were not entirely honest with their promises. I'm kind of concerned.

697
03:39:41,579 --> 03:40:35,750
I have no bullets, but it's going to make them count. A lot of health here. Okay. I have the

698
03:40:35,750 --> 03:41:48,299
10 shots. This guy here. No, is it you? How do I get up on the stairs? Check the helmet cam.

699
03:42:07,030 --> 03:42:35,139
There he is. Not just that. He's also a magician. Really? Where are they approaching from there?

700
03:42:35,139 --> 03:43:10,979
Okay. What's up? That was a huge first shot. It killed almost everybody. Let's go.

701
03:43:25,510 --> 03:43:31,260
Any more? Oh, they're across the way. I want a throwing knife. Somebody right in the head.

702
03:43:44,200 --> 03:43:51,139
Wow. How many grenades are over here? That was like 10. What? Did you see the indicator? That was

703
03:43:51,139 --> 03:44:14,040
like at least six. Whoa. You got to be kidding me. All right. Let's do it clean this time.

704
03:44:23,860 --> 03:45:10,010
Where are they? Where are they? It's one guy just sitting in here in the kitchen or something.

705
03:45:10,010 --> 03:45:47,159
Go back to the helmet. I think I might've broke it. He's right there. I think I broke it. Wait,

706
03:45:47,159 --> 03:46:44,620
was it that guy? Here we go. Did you think we're good now? Yeah. Oh, right in the head.

707
03:47:14,889 --> 03:47:21,450
He landed it horizontally with his back. Dude. Oh, I think that was a bug.

708
03:47:22,409 --> 03:47:50,170
That was a bug. Somebody's still alive. How come your feet are glowing red? Because I got

709
03:47:50,170 --> 03:47:57,059
the fire flower. That's why I just have a fire on them. It's a nice touch. They added it.

710
03:48:11,059 --> 03:48:49,379
Where are you? Oh, there you are. Oh, Jesus. Oh, run. I got to bring you all the way around

711
03:48:49,379 --> 03:48:58,620
the house. You're going to get stuck in here. Watch this. Hey, bro. He has no idea where I am.

712
03:48:58,620 --> 03:49:27,139
Yes, he does. Don't let him grab you. Damn it. Oh, shit. I thought I was being sneaky.

713
03:49:27,139 --> 03:49:41,819
I was being sneaky. All right. Well, now knowing that I need a different gun,

714
03:49:41,819 --> 03:50:08,659
this thing has no bullets. Anything on the ground? I might be in trouble. Well, it's Dragon.

715
03:50:08,659 --> 03:50:16,069
Gianni is carrying this entire mission. His work is so good. Oh, the voice work. Yeah. Oh,

716
03:50:16,069 --> 03:50:50,219
you better believe it. How did that miss? It went right through his armpit. Where is he? Oh,

717
03:50:56,579 --> 03:51:19,639
he's destroying this whole place. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. There's another gun on the

718
03:51:19,639 --> 03:52:01,299
ground. Shit. Invisibility is so useful here. Where'd he go? Jesus. That's a lot of grenades.

719
03:52:15,540 --> 03:52:32,409
Don't get stuck on that. Come on, man. Get out of my way, Ben.

720
03:52:55,290 --> 03:53:08,500
Almost down to the last bullet. Final bullet. Nice. This game is intense.

721
03:53:08,899 --> 03:53:23,450
I can't imagine doing this on something harder than very hard. If you die instantly in Rage Mode,

722
03:53:23,450 --> 03:53:32,649
I feel like that's going to be extraordinarily difficult. Extreme was not too hard to do.

723
03:53:33,209 --> 03:53:43,879
I wonder if Rage Mode is. I wonder what the strategy is to actually do this on Rage Mode.

724
03:53:45,420 --> 03:54:07,159
What weapon is it? What series of weapons? Is that not the right way? Oh, um, wait though.

725
03:54:08,250 --> 03:54:27,000
I ran over a weapon and I need. There it is. I already have a shotgun. Is there no other

726
03:54:27,000 --> 03:54:37,399
weapon on the ground? I really only have one bullet to kill this guy. That's it. I swear.

727
03:54:37,399 --> 03:54:58,889
I saw another gun. There it is. All right. Creepy. Jesus. So it's true. You really are

728
03:54:58,889 --> 03:55:09,299
just like me. Question is. Oh, he slowed down time. You slowed time down. I get it. He's doing the

729
03:55:09,299 --> 03:55:34,889
same powers that I am. That's interesting. It kind of sounds like somebody's listening to like a

730
03:55:34,889 --> 03:55:53,370
really intense movie in the other room. I'll take this thing. Look at this thing.

731
03:55:53,370 --> 03:56:10,819
Still doing browser games? Um, probably not. I don't think so. I think it's going to take me

732
03:56:10,819 --> 03:56:24,120
all the way to the next hour or two to beat this. Dual Weld. I got it. Dual Weld Serum. I love how

733
03:56:24,120 --> 03:56:36,860
you have to inject yourself to be able to hold two guns. That's funny. H. Find another weapon of the

734
03:56:36,860 --> 03:56:54,299
same type. Will two at the same time. Boy. Uh, how do you shoot them both? They both just fire.

735
03:56:54,299 --> 03:57:12,649
I'll try this for now. Two shotguns. How do I switch weapons? Dual Shotgun. I feel like this

736
03:57:12,649 --> 03:57:21,620
would be great. Yeah. I'm, I'm all right with this. Can I even pick up? I don't think I haven't had

737
03:57:21,620 --> 03:57:43,579
two shotguns here. I don't have enough ammo for it either. Yeah. I'm good with this. Dual Auto Weapons

738
03:57:43,579 --> 03:58:11,209
of Insane Recoil. Find out. Don't fall down there. Who's shooting? I just kicked that guy's

739
03:58:11,209 --> 03:58:39,530
fucking chin off. Come here. Come here. Come here. Holy fuck. Holy fuck. What the hell? Oh,

740
03:58:40,090 --> 03:58:52,250
I don't even know who did that. I'm not even sure that was supposed to happen, but it did happen.

741
03:58:52,969 --> 03:59:26,739
I'm not entirely sure what just happened. Got him. Oh my fucking God.

742
03:59:35,540 --> 04:00:21,780
Okay. Relax for a sec. Don't you dare. Get away. Who's left? Dude, what the hell? Come on.

743
04:00:22,579 --> 04:00:35,260
I was trying not to hit them. I was trying to have it bounce where their feet were. Somebody

744
04:00:35,260 --> 04:00:49,420
said this game makes you really feel like a guggada. True. Oh my God. That was brutal.

745
04:01:01,979 --> 04:01:08,899
I think he said, Oh no. I can't even react, dude. It's fucking too much going on.

746
04:01:08,899 --> 04:01:57,540
Oh no. Geez. I'm all right. Fiddlesticks. Did he actually say Fiddlesticks? No, he didn't.

747
04:02:07,450 --> 04:02:21,799
You piece of shit. That was so perfect of a throw. I hate your guts. I'm not even doing that.

748
04:02:30,309 --> 04:02:52,579
I just did the fucking Luigi from Mario 2. I just pulled off a Yoshi midair. Oh, okay. Go now?

749
04:02:52,579 --> 04:03:02,549
You want to go now? Wait, let me get all the ammo. I got plenty. I'm good.

750
04:03:17,770 --> 04:03:34,120
I think those are going to fall down. Somebody's head came down here. Hey,

751
04:03:34,680 --> 04:04:10,280
watch where you're throwing those. Somebody's arm. Oh no. Oh shit. Nobody else is going to come down

752
04:04:10,280 --> 04:04:27,190
here, right? It's so dusty. What's going on up there? I think somebody just said, shut the fuck

753
04:04:27,270 --> 04:04:53,850
up. All right. The dust is. Wait. Oh, two guys right there. Are you guys okay?

754
04:05:05,610 --> 04:05:25,739
That guy was alive. They're getting too close to the edge. Those are our teammates.

755
04:05:25,739 --> 04:05:34,299
Okay. All right. I think we can move on. I mean, it's still mayhem up there, but three stooges war.

756
04:05:40,090 --> 04:05:47,139
What was that? What was that? That was like somebody's thumb. What is that?

757
04:05:48,739 --> 04:05:50,420
It's somebody's shoe.

758
04:06:06,170 --> 04:06:22,229
This is crazy. The loafers just got ruined. How much more men do they have? Oh shit. Are you all

759
04:06:22,229 --> 04:06:42,819
right? I'm kind of hoping somebody lands down here and is alive. All right. They're actually,

760
04:06:42,819 --> 04:06:51,909
they're starting to get smart. They're starting to get smart. What happens if they run out of ammo?

761
04:06:51,909 --> 04:07:21,350
Can they run out of ammo? Where's my grenade? Hey, I got to get out of here. I have to move on.

762
04:07:22,469 --> 04:07:53,780
This is going to keep happening forever. All right. That's fun. Sneaky. That was kind of fun.

763
04:07:54,340 --> 04:08:25,209
Oh, they're done. Penetrator. Oh, what's that? Oh, no. Definitely keep this. All everything.

764
04:08:25,209 --> 04:08:37,159
The actor is left. Yeah, that's true. Oh, that was very enjoyable. What the fuck? Somebody burped.

765
04:08:41,620 --> 04:09:09,879
What the fuck is happening? Oh, those were my guys, were they? What the hell, man? What? I

766
04:09:09,879 --> 04:09:47,290
didn't know they were my guys. There's the belt again. My game just crashed. What do I do now?

767
04:09:47,290 --> 04:10:19,930
Hold on. I have to restart the game. This game is very good. I love this game. It's very fun.

768
04:10:19,930 --> 04:10:39,479
What was that? What the hell was that? Was that the game? What's happening? Are we good?

769
04:10:40,200 --> 04:11:20,340
Are we good? I think we're good. All right. Let's go. We're going to go all the way up. Whoa.

770
04:11:33,020 --> 04:11:55,479
Come here. I'm out of ammo. There's so many people over here. What am I doing?

771
04:11:56,120 --> 04:12:27,340
All right. Let's go. What are you doing? Get away from me.

772
04:12:36,299 --> 04:12:39,659
Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

773
04:12:40,620 --> 04:13:30,680
Here we go. Why has my gun forsaken me? It feels like I wasn't into Tom and Jerry, somebody said.

774
04:13:43,530 --> 04:13:48,969
Dude, I need health so bad. I have no ammo. I have no ammo. I have no ammo. I have no ammo.

775
04:13:48,969 --> 04:14:48,360
I have no ammo. I have no ammo. Oh, shit. Fuck you. Oh, I didn't get them all. Shit. Sorry.

776
04:14:48,360 --> 04:14:57,180
Ready? There's way too many. Oh, fuck off. Damn it. All right. I got to get a different gun.

777
04:14:57,180 --> 04:15:46,969
I'm using too many bullets. I got to conserve bullets. Here we go. Better. Keep going. Go,

778
04:15:46,969 --> 04:16:10,340
go, go, go, go. We're good so far. I just launched my... Don't go off the edge.

779
04:16:31,819 --> 04:17:08,760
Oh my God. Better. Okay. Assess. Assess. Get rid of that. There it is. All right. I'm going

780
04:17:08,760 --> 04:17:15,590
to hold off for that now. Let's just use this thing for now. Autosave here. Okay. Am I going

781
04:17:15,590 --> 04:18:07,959
down? High level target. Got him. Who's got the smoke? What? Shit. Oh, thank goodness. All right.

782
04:18:07,959 --> 04:18:28,950
We're fine. Everyone. We're alive. Perfectly cut screen. It was intense and I did not expect it.

783
04:18:54,459 --> 04:19:11,719
You know what? Oh, I thought those were green. Ah. Sorry. These are fine. You know what? Throw

784
04:19:11,719 --> 04:20:04,780
these anyways. Get rid of them. What's up? Oh, he's right there. All right. Boss time. I could

785
04:20:04,780 --> 04:20:14,170
do double shotgun, but there's not enough ammo. So, I'm going to stick with this. My funny this

786
04:20:14,170 --> 04:20:33,420
ammo. I think I'm good. How far into the game are you? Um, I don't know. I could put a dual

787
04:20:33,420 --> 04:21:10,389
weld on here. That's exactly what I'm going to do. All right. Let's go. Boss time. Today is a day of

788
04:21:10,389 --> 04:21:26,729
grieving. You are the second brother I must kill. There's a lot of guns back here.

789
04:21:27,290 --> 04:21:44,409
Where do you go? All right. We're going to just expel all the weapons. I just unloaded this so

790
04:21:44,409 --> 04:22:04,360
much. I'm just throw. I'm just whatever I got over here. I'm just throwing. I just went through the

791
04:22:04,360 --> 04:22:50,969
table. Get out of here. I just threw an axe. Good strat. Oh, it hurts. What the fuck did that guy

792
04:22:50,969 --> 04:23:06,280
come from? Where did that guy? That is another one. Oh shit. We're right in the middle of this.

793
04:23:14,180 --> 04:23:27,079
It's too much stimulation. This is way too much stimulation right now. I don't even have any

794
04:23:27,079 --> 04:23:53,270
ammo. It's too much stimulation. I don't know. Is there enemies? Is that thing still alive?

795
04:24:16,229 --> 04:24:18,870
Shit. It's all right. We're right here.

796
04:24:43,290 --> 04:24:52,709
It's too much. There's too much going on. It's just carnage. It's just mayhem. Stop moaning.

797
04:24:53,959 --> 04:24:59,319
That's not me. That's them. That's them doing that. Is that not me? I don't know. Am I doing

798
04:24:59,319 --> 04:25:09,500
that? I can't tell. It's intense. All right. I got to do this. This guy's got to die right now.

799
04:25:10,139 --> 04:25:32,389
Did he jump out the window? He's dead. All right. All right. We're good. I got it. I got it. I'll

800
04:25:32,389 --> 04:26:06,040
get it now. He's alive. He's alive. Get me the fuck away from him. Freeload the gun.

801
04:26:27,500 --> 04:26:57,370
Where is he? Yeah. Stop moaning. I'm going to be. You've been breathing.

802
04:27:03,270 --> 04:27:08,469
You've been breathing so loud. It's an intense game. You have a microphone right next to my mouth

803
04:27:09,399 --> 04:27:14,819
when you're sitting there gaming, when you're gaming it up real hard. There's no microphone

804
04:27:14,819 --> 04:27:18,579
sitting right here. Just like, Oh, let's get every fucking breath that comes out of his mouth.

805
04:27:18,579 --> 04:27:40,219
That was intense. That's one chill stream. I'm chilling out.

806
04:27:41,659 --> 04:27:50,379
Stuff can be intense and still just be kind of operating at like 70% or so. I'm just hanging out.

807
04:27:57,989 --> 04:28:14,940
What'd you do? You're screaming. We need to go on the offensive again. Yeah. But I don't know.

808
04:28:14,940 --> 04:28:24,540
Chill mindset. Chill stream is a mindset. Yeah. It's definitely a mindset. I think when I say

809
04:28:24,540 --> 04:28:32,760
chill streams, I think what I mean is usually no cam and just whatever happens. I'm just going to

810
04:28:32,760 --> 04:28:39,110
play and not really paying attention to much else. Looking over chat every now and then.

811
04:28:39,110 --> 04:28:52,899
The game is intense. That's fine. This means he's naked. I think I'm just going, I go into these

812
04:28:52,899 --> 04:29:03,989
more when I say chill stream with the intention of being dialed down like 30% or so. And plus it

813
04:29:03,989 --> 04:29:09,030
is 110 degrees. It's very hot out right now. So yeah, I don't have any upper clothing on.

814
04:29:09,030 --> 04:29:32,889
Oh wait, I want to see the, I think I can do it from here. This site 83 Russia. So I'm going to assume

815
04:29:32,889 --> 04:29:42,709
there's probably two missions left. The green from what one guy in chat said is these are wave

816
04:29:42,709 --> 04:29:55,540
missions. I'm going to imagine another one opens up somewhere around here. Some of them are.

817
04:30:00,329 --> 04:30:06,299
Let me, I'm going to go pee one more time. Maybe more than once. It's cool. I like these. These are

818
04:30:06,299 --> 04:30:12,500
a lot like your older streams. That's part of the intention too is just kind of turning something on

819
04:30:12,500 --> 04:30:20,219
and just hanging out and doing whatever. We do a lot of wacky kind of crazy shit here, but I don't

820
04:30:20,219 --> 04:30:33,799
want that to be the only thing that anyone can ever anticipate here. If that makes sense. And again,

821
04:30:33,799 --> 04:30:42,170
the whole off brand stuff kind of splitting up time between having a job and everything. I have

822
04:30:42,170 --> 04:30:49,879
a job now. Yeah, I'll be right back. We'll keep going. Site 83. As long as you're having fun. Oh

823
04:30:49,879 --> 04:34:13,340
yeah, for sure. Oh Megalel a job. All right. You're back. I am back. Oh, hold on. I forgot my drink.

824
04:34:13,340 --> 04:34:56,939
All right. Let's keep going. Site 83 is the next one. Repurpose this former Soviet military base

825
04:34:56,939 --> 04:35:02,419
into a research facility. Nearby civilians were evacuated earlier today under the cover of a gas

826
04:35:02,419 --> 04:35:17,049
leak. We're sending you in with a small team. I do want to play around with the weapons for a second.

827
04:35:17,049 --> 04:35:55,900
Where's that area to do that in? A deadly nerve agent. There it is. All right. Bolt launcher.

828
04:35:55,900 --> 04:36:14,970
Rat bombs. Some of these you have to actually beat on high difficulty. Bolt launcher. That's what this

829
04:36:14,970 --> 04:36:31,340
does. I thought this was a shotgun. Okay. It's not a shotgun. What else can you do? Penetrator. More

830
04:36:31,340 --> 04:36:42,069
accurate and powerful non-explosive bolts. Single fire. How does that work? That was just a very,

831
04:36:42,229 --> 04:37:00,259
it's like a magnum. It's like a Resident Evil magnum. Pretty good. It doesn't have a lot of

832
04:37:00,259 --> 04:37:19,189
ammo though. Pretty low. I'll try it. It's a comedy gun. Does that mean I could have two of them?

833
04:37:25,060 --> 04:37:39,180
You can't use two of them? Okay. I actually like these. Take the suppressor off. Try the two

834
04:37:39,180 --> 04:38:20,759
shotguns. Yeah. Let's do that. Excuse me. That's an easy way to get them out of the way. I just died

835
04:38:20,759 --> 04:38:36,310
in a place where you shouldn't, you can't even die. What just happened? I couldn't pick up the

836
04:38:36,389 --> 04:38:47,750
shotguns on the ground. You saw me try at least a few times. I tried. My theory was I could throw

837
04:38:47,750 --> 04:39:01,029
a grenade and they would get out of the way. And it was kind of true. We haven't done this in a

838
04:39:01,029 --> 04:39:25,860
while. Ooh. Moody. Keep the red shoes. Let's do that. All right. Now let's go back to what I was

839
04:39:25,860 --> 04:40:01,529
going to do. Shotgun. Shotgun again. There it is. So how does this work? Wacky. I kind of don't like

840
04:40:01,529 --> 04:40:27,060
it though. We'll go bolt launcher and the double SMG. No suppressor, no nothing. But I do want this

841
04:40:27,060 --> 04:40:39,220
to have the penetrator on. All right. Can you dual snipers? I probably not. Let's say it if I can.

842
04:40:39,220 --> 04:40:51,110
Dual snipers would be strange. You could fire one of those quicker than just dual welding. Yeah.

843
04:40:51,110 --> 04:41:07,939
That's what it feels like. All right. Let's go. Is there anything else you can do up here?

844
04:41:07,939 --> 04:41:28,409
Or is it just these three things? Can I get in this room again? I somehow get this wrong every

845
04:41:28,409 --> 04:41:55,610
oh there it is. All right. Site 83. Let's do it. I will say I do have a hard out in about an hour.

846
04:41:55,610 --> 04:42:00,279
I don't know if I'm going to be able to beat the whole thing in one sitting here. I'm not going to

847
04:42:00,279 --> 04:42:30,200
rush. It's a hard out. Somewhere around 830 Pacific I have to have to go. I think it's possible. Each

848
04:42:30,200 --> 04:42:36,619
mission has been about 45 minutes to an hour. Ooh. But I'm not rushing this. I genuinely really like

849
04:42:36,619 --> 04:42:41,500
this game a lot. So I'm not rushing to the end. I want to stream it again. Let's do it again.

850
04:42:42,709 --> 04:42:50,819
And do the side missions and stuff. So don't worry. The next stream after House Slipper I

851
04:42:50,819 --> 04:42:58,860
will finish Trippang. So what does the gas mask do now? This mission is pretty long.

852
04:43:02,840 --> 04:43:06,520
And browser games. Well that would make a lot of sense wouldn't it?

853
04:43:08,490 --> 04:43:11,930
Finish up Trippang and then do browser stuff. That makes sense to me.

854
04:43:16,709 --> 04:43:27,180
Yeah. House Slipper is Tuesday. We're never going to see this game again. No, no way.

855
04:43:28,139 --> 04:43:45,369
No way to what you said. Are you going to dress fancy? I might.

856
04:43:52,950 --> 04:44:04,889
This mission is really good. Ooh, nice. They've all been pretty strong so far.

857
04:44:29,509 --> 04:44:35,430
Sorry. I should be talking. What's going on everybody? Welcome to mission five.

858
04:44:36,470 --> 04:44:44,330
We are ready. We're going to get in here. We're going to guns blazing. Make sure you follow the

859
04:44:44,330 --> 04:45:00,700
stream. Intel. Emergency alert. All personnel must don gas masks and CBRN suits immediately.

860
04:45:01,259 --> 04:45:06,889
Shelter in place and await further orders. Do you experience auditory or visual hallucinations?

861
04:45:06,889 --> 04:45:40,169
Disarm yourself and report to security immediately. Jesus. Bro, you're watching TV.

862
04:45:42,340 --> 04:45:46,979
There's no way you can see through that. You're watching YouTube videos through that thing.

863
04:45:47,560 --> 04:45:49,720
I'm not going to tell on you, but like, come on, turn it off.

864
04:46:01,590 --> 04:46:22,490
Does the gas mask mean I can't run for that long or is it my breathing different or something?

865
04:46:29,939 --> 04:46:30,819
That would make sense.

866
04:46:40,740 --> 04:46:45,189
All right. Who dies first? Phantom one one or Phantom one two?

867
04:46:48,259 --> 04:46:55,369
Composer or Oracle? Who dies first? Me or me?

868
04:46:56,490 --> 04:47:03,909
Let's, okay, let's get a vote. Is there a mod right here? Who dies first? Phantom one one.

869
04:47:05,459 --> 04:47:17,049
This is Oracle. Composer or me? Who dies first? That's actually going to be really hard.

870
04:47:24,180 --> 04:47:28,490
Bet or a poll? I think it has to be a poll because bet would be between two, right?

871
04:47:28,490 --> 04:47:36,919
Let's do a poll. Bet? Can you bet with more than, you can add more?

872
04:47:37,860 --> 04:47:44,549
All right, then make it a bet. Who dies first? Between the three of us.

873
04:47:45,029 --> 04:47:51,159
Oracle, who is one one, composer is one two, and then me.

874
04:47:51,159 --> 04:47:57,080
Well, now you got me all fucked up because now I'm gonna, I'm gonna be really concerned now.

875
04:47:57,080 --> 04:48:10,869
The options are Oracle, who is one one, composer who is one two, and then me.

876
04:48:10,869 --> 04:48:20,119
What if no one dies? Well, then everyone gets refunded. Yeah, they're doing it now.

877
04:48:20,119 --> 04:48:38,900
Is it friendly fire? Yes, I believe that's correct. Part of me kind of hopes we open this door and a

878
04:48:38,900 --> 04:48:44,580
grenade just kills all three of us. Then we're gonna have to go frame by frame and see who

879
04:48:44,580 --> 04:49:07,860
exploded into guts first. People saying like, oh, what if we, we can just look it up? Yeah.

880
04:49:11,669 --> 04:49:21,529
I'm in this too. I've died probably 40 or 50 times so far in this game.

881
04:49:21,529 --> 04:49:28,099
In the, in the gameplay walkthrough, it does not say, hey, and then streamer German985 walks

882
04:49:28,099 --> 04:49:47,909
down the hallway and gets hit in the head with an axe. All right, good luck. Imagine, imagine betting

883
04:49:47,909 --> 04:50:00,169
on fucking Oracle. Couldn't even go through the door, right? I thought that just killed me

884
04:50:00,169 --> 04:50:39,830
for some reason. What was that? Okay, I thought he disappeared. Hey, get out of the way. 31, 33,

885
04:50:39,830 --> 04:51:07,900
and 36%. Wow. Oh, my fucking heart attack. That 83 was formerly a Soviet military base.

886
04:51:07,900 --> 04:51:35,450
I still got everybody. Oracle, composer. This door is automated. See if you can find a generator.

887
04:51:35,450 --> 04:51:50,409
We'll keep this always. I'm not gonna die at the exact same time. These motherfuckers set up flood

888
04:51:50,490 --> 04:51:53,450
lights, but they don't have the common decency to change a fucking light bulb.

889
04:51:53,450 --> 04:52:19,990
They're both going to die off camera. They're both going to die off camera. But who screams first?

890
04:52:19,990 --> 04:52:25,319
Who screams first? It's going to be composed. It's going to be like,

891
04:52:28,709 --> 04:52:40,860
and then fucking Phantom's going to be like, no, composer. One member of the security team

892
04:52:40,860 --> 04:52:55,400
is unaccounted for. Here we go. The guy's running faster than an F1 car. That's scary.

893
04:52:55,400 --> 04:53:05,819
I thought his name was Oracle. What'd I say? Phantom? I don't even have their names right.

894
04:53:08,279 --> 04:53:12,220
Oh, yeah. Phantom. That's a pretty cool name, though.

895
04:53:22,759 --> 04:53:32,099
Okay. I almost just lost it for myself. Oh, they're Phantom one. Okay, right. Phantom is

896
04:53:32,099 --> 04:53:45,659
like the name of the unit. All right. That's what it was. I'm actually really intrigued.

897
04:53:47,479 --> 04:54:31,689
Who gets grabbed by the monster first? Are we good? Where'd they go? Can we identify them?

898
04:54:31,689 --> 04:54:55,540
Are they alive? We would have heard them on the radio. That's a lot of blood. All right.

899
04:54:55,540 --> 04:55:02,069
Get the forensics. Is this Oracle's blood here? Whose blood is this? What time did they die?

900
04:55:08,340 --> 04:55:33,540
I saw somebody. I saw a body on the ground. Jesus Christ. Don't run. What do you mean don't run?

901
04:55:34,180 --> 04:56:12,340
Can't kill them. So I'm hallucinating. I think they're blind. Don't run. Move silently. Oh,

902
04:56:12,340 --> 04:56:27,880
you got to be kidding me. Crystal physically pulling and absorbing several objects within

903
04:56:27,880 --> 04:56:33,259
close proximity. I'm not sure where they're taken to. There's several cameras inside and

904
04:56:33,259 --> 04:56:37,020
they continue to transmit from the location at least a thousand miles away. Thousands of miles

905
04:56:37,020 --> 04:56:58,580
away. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? It's coming down.

906
04:56:58,580 --> 04:57:05,430
What do I do? Okay. I know what to do. You just said run. That's the one thing it said to not do.

907
04:57:06,150 --> 04:57:26,740
Oracle's going to go on the radio. I'm so glad I could see you. Phantom over there didn't make it.

908
04:57:28,139 --> 04:57:47,400
Or whatever. Composer. I don't know. I met the guy yesterday. I don't remember what his name is.

909
04:58:03,700 --> 04:58:07,540
This is composer. This is composer. I repeat. This is composer taking heavy enemy fire.

910
04:58:08,659 --> 04:58:36,009
What the fuck did it come on? Did both of them die at once? I don't know. I don't know. We didn't

911
04:58:36,009 --> 04:59:10,099
even hear a scream. We didn't hear anything. Am I going the right way? Yeah. Usually there's a

912
04:59:10,099 --> 04:59:21,540
yowl or something. Yeah. There usually is a yowl. Access attempt successful uploading. Data package.

913
04:59:22,409 --> 04:59:32,439
Upload complete. Incoming transmission. Bunch of swears. User identified. Subject 106.

914
04:59:33,240 --> 04:59:43,049
Your mission is nearing completion. Will it end on your terms or theirs? Who is sending us these

915
04:59:43,049 --> 05:00:34,950
things? Yeah. Usually there's a yowl. Can I move this? It was activated somehow. That's not good.

916
05:00:34,950 --> 05:00:40,919
And it gets worse. PA system said there is some unauthorized activity in the loading bay.

917
05:00:41,560 --> 05:00:42,680
Think we ought to check it out.

918
05:00:42,680 --> 05:00:51,770
What the fuck is that? Don't let him near the console.

919
05:00:51,770 --> 05:01:09,400
Did you say that? Don't. Hey. My last breath. Don't let him near the console. Uh oh. Is he

920
05:01:09,400 --> 05:01:24,729
going to be okay? Yeah. They're going to be fine. I'm going to get jumpscare grabbed by one of these.

921
05:01:26,979 --> 05:01:46,279
Wait. Who is that? I. How did you knock it? You know there's monsters around here. You should

922
05:01:46,279 --> 05:01:52,139
be using suppression things. You're going to attract the monster. You guys are attracting the

923
05:01:52,139 --> 05:02:23,880
monster. You are attracting the monster. You idiots. Why are you firing so? But okay.

924
05:02:25,669 --> 05:02:32,819
Are they still alive? We don't know if that was them in the room. Hold on. We need to confirm this.

925
05:02:33,819 --> 05:02:48,659
You died first. But we're not sure though. We're not sure. How's this for strange activity?

926
05:03:00,470 --> 05:03:06,549
First confirmed death? No, no, no. That's not how it works. Not yet. Not yet. We need to know if

927
05:03:06,549 --> 05:03:38,099
they died first. That's not how time works. They may have been dead from the very beginning.

928
05:03:38,099 --> 05:03:45,380
I think one of them was on the ground. Possibly. We got to confirm it. I hear the whisperings.

929
05:03:45,380 --> 05:04:10,630
Let's cope. Even if it is cope, we need to confirm it. I agree with you. It very well could be me.

930
05:04:11,189 --> 05:04:40,979
What if they're MIA forever? I don't know. Is it confirmed? I hate this. Am I even going the right

931
05:04:40,979 --> 05:05:22,459
way? No. This way? This room is so bright. It's hard to see. Oh, okay. What is that? Something

932
05:05:22,459 --> 05:05:39,750
sprinting around? If he gets to the end and those two dudes are still alive, then he died first.

933
05:05:39,750 --> 05:06:01,750
How are we ever going to know? Something is sprinting around out here. Okay. It's just that.

934
05:06:01,750 --> 05:06:27,369
What the hell is going on? What's wrong with my bitrate? Do I have to do something here?

935
05:06:27,369 --> 05:07:01,529
What the fuck just happened? Okay. So I'm hallucinating right now. That's what's going on.

936
05:07:01,529 --> 05:08:15,099
Um, this is back rooms? Actual back rooms? Hold on. Do not enter. I'm going in. Nevermind.

937
05:08:15,099 --> 05:08:49,060
Uh, what's going in here? I thought that was a really cool Fortnite weapon. These posters again.

938
05:09:06,180 --> 05:10:13,590
Oh, fuck you. I can't go through this glass. I don't like this. Something is running. Come on.

939
05:10:13,590 --> 05:10:38,069
What's that? Something's red over there. What is that thing? This actually sucks. This actually

940
05:10:38,069 --> 05:10:57,000
is very scary. Oh, who is it? Who is it? Who is it? Do we have an ID? We have an ID. You still

941
05:10:57,000 --> 05:11:38,279
died first. They died after you. Hold on. We don't know that. I don't know who that is. Oh,

942
05:11:38,279 --> 05:12:06,259
it's just a radio playing scary Halloween CDs. Come on, dude. I'm never betting channel points

943
05:12:06,259 --> 05:12:25,560
ever again. No, we'll pay it out. It needs to be confirmed. All right. Auto save. Holy shit.

944
05:12:25,560 --> 05:13:08,759
This dude pogged his pants. Oh, what the fuck? It just knows where I am. I thought if I stop

945
05:13:08,759 --> 05:14:07,979
doing that. Oh, it's that hand again. Stop doing that. Oh, yeah. All right. Get the intel.

946
05:14:07,979 --> 05:14:22,900
Take a bath. Just paranoid that if I'm going to run. I've heard the sound effects this whole time.

947
05:14:22,900 --> 05:14:37,990
Well, very obviously we got here. This is still fine. I like these weapons. I'm going to keep them.

948
05:14:37,990 --> 05:15:46,279
Find me? The hell does that mean? Somebody just used that. When I find, what do I do? Okay. Where

949
05:15:46,279 --> 05:16:19,560
am I trying to go? This way. Don't do it. Are you crouching? Uh, no, this is the character's height.

950
05:16:19,560 --> 05:16:30,200
Phantom 2-1. That's Phantom 2-1. Do we wait? It's 2-1. I wonder if they're going to be down there.

951
05:16:30,200 --> 05:17:13,159
We need 1-2 and 1-1. I pressed it, right? Is there no power or something? I do. Do you have any idea

952
05:17:13,159 --> 05:17:37,909
where 1-1 and 1-2 is? I need to confirm if they died. I had a bet. He's got the autopsy report.

953
05:17:37,909 --> 05:18:24,389
Oh shit. Phantom. Wait, it's not you guys. It was them. If it was them, that would have been so

954
05:18:24,389 --> 05:18:35,830
fucking funny. That would have been unbelievably funny. I don't think there would have been another

955
05:18:35,830 --> 05:18:45,369
funnier clip on this channel if I just unloaded and killed them both. Uh, all right. Now what?

956
05:18:45,369 --> 05:19:11,340
Drop down here? No way, right? I guess so. What was that? There was somebody in there.

957
05:19:11,340 --> 05:19:37,560
That was weird. Static. The expedition team members and all camera feeds were cut.

958
05:19:37,560 --> 05:20:26,259
Gas lamps went off. Everyone's waiting to get gas masks. Weird. Oh. Uh, yeah. What can I do for you?

959
05:20:26,259 --> 05:21:29,610
Boy. Somebody's in here. Erm, what's going on here? I like the erm. All right. I just

960
05:21:29,610 --> 05:21:35,349
remember playing Call of Duty. Black Ops. And there would be people running around like this.

961
05:21:35,349 --> 05:21:44,279
And they would be playing the way that this game is actually played. In fast motion. And they would

962
05:21:44,279 --> 05:22:18,180
kill that many people in a room. Weird carpet. God. I'm thinking about just sprinting. It just

963
05:22:18,180 --> 05:22:32,650
disappeared. Oh, stop it. What the hell was that? Did you see that? I saw it. I saw it. I saw it.

964
05:22:32,650 --> 05:23:23,080
All the time. I saw it. You right here. Found you. Oh, let me play Call of Duty for a second.

965
05:23:23,419 --> 05:23:33,209
Let me play Call of Duty for a second. Make sure I'm like lying down on the ground. Is that a hallway?

966
05:23:33,930 --> 05:24:04,979
Okay. Did somebody just walk in? I'm here. I'm here. Kill me. I'm here. I'm here. Kill me. Pretty

967
05:24:04,979 --> 05:24:30,139
good, Arnold. At least a 3 out of 10. I like it the way they are. Don't. That thing just keeps burping

968
05:24:30,139 --> 05:25:25,209
in my ear and it scares me every time. Oh, I can play Call of Duty. Oh, shit. I got out ammo.

969
05:25:25,209 --> 05:26:01,400
Our UAV is online. Our UAV is airborne. What's that thing that was in the sky and just went

970
05:26:03,049 --> 05:26:14,900
baaaaaaam. Why would you throw that grenade over there? Explain it. Explain it to me. Explain it.

971
05:26:35,990 --> 05:26:43,319
All right. We're gone. You and me. If that thing shows up, I'm feeding it to you.

972
05:26:43,319 --> 05:26:53,340
I don't know if you're going to want to eat it though, dude. What happened? Well, get out of

973
05:26:53,340 --> 05:27:00,169
here then. Oh, you're not allowed to come through here. Only the main character gets to do this.

974
05:27:00,169 --> 05:28:03,189
I need one, two in there. I don't see one, two. All right. What do we got? Okay. Double laser.

975
05:28:03,189 --> 05:28:27,979
Composer? Oh, it's a different person. One, two, cauliflower. Did I do that? Did I do that?

976
05:28:28,540 --> 05:28:57,049
It was quite the Steve Urkel. Uh, okay. Subject 83. Let me in.

977
05:29:11,099 --> 05:30:32,659
Do I have to sneak? Where's subject 83? How did you not get hit by goodbye? Wait, give me that.

978
05:30:33,299 --> 05:30:43,849
Subject 83. I don't even know where it is. Where is it? Maybe I have to shoot this. Can I control

979
05:30:43,849 --> 05:31:17,380
that? I don't think so. Something's coming. What the hell is that? Are they all going to turn into

980
05:31:17,380 --> 05:31:23,029
monsters? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

981
05:31:24,090 --> 05:31:38,700
When they're doing that, I think I have to go press the stuff on the walls, right? Uh, wait,

982
05:31:38,700 --> 05:32:12,360
can I, I can't just do this. I think that's what I have to do. Um, I don't know. Oh, touch it.

983
05:32:12,360 --> 05:33:05,400
If I can get them all. There's two more. Oh shit. Oh, die. Oh, right in his head.

984
05:33:08,860 --> 05:33:49,849
Jesus. We're still firing. All right. I got to turn these off. This game is chaos. It's great.

985
05:33:49,849 --> 05:33:58,569
What the? We're good. The Jerma die first. Why is the bet still going? Uh, cause it needs to be

986
05:33:58,569 --> 05:34:19,299
confirmed. We've not confirmed it. It's eight 30. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. I got to, I got to

987
05:34:19,299 --> 05:34:28,919
go, but not, I can, I can finish this. This is probably the boss. Uh, now what? Yeah. Low's almost

988
05:34:28,919 --> 05:34:35,909
over. I can stick around for like another 20 minutes right here. Where's this electricity?

989
05:34:36,470 --> 05:34:52,840
There it is. Composer two one is not our guy. Yeah. If I get, if we get to the end of the level and we

990
05:34:52,840 --> 05:35:06,900
can't confirm it, then then we'll just refund everything. Oh, that's a lot of people in there.

991
05:35:07,860 --> 05:35:45,099
We still alive. Whoa. Oh shit. In my pants. That guy has a machine gun. What did he say?

992
05:35:46,970 --> 05:36:20,020
Thanks a lot. All right. Any more ammo and this should be it right here. Right. I'm stuck on the

993
05:36:20,020 --> 05:36:45,689
stairs. All right. There's one more. I think it was the one that was up here. Yep. The last one.

994
05:36:56,439 --> 05:37:08,119
Oh God. Damn it. I had way too much confidence running down there without any slow mo. It's okay.

995
05:37:08,119 --> 05:37:37,340
It saves it right there. Thank you. Right. Oh, all right. Get away, get away, get away, get away.

996
05:37:40,810 --> 05:38:01,509
That had to have killed him. Oh, quiet. You're so loud. Oh my God. You have a flame thrower of some

997
05:38:01,509 --> 05:38:38,549
sort. All right. This is it. Perfect sleep stream. Uh, I'm not so sure about that, but we are having

998
05:38:38,549 --> 05:38:49,669
fun nonetheless. All right. Let me just get everything. Cause this is the last wave where

999
05:38:49,669 --> 05:38:54,549
this might be the actual fight. Maybe I'm definitely gonna have to shoot it with that. That's

1000
05:38:55,110 --> 05:39:25,669
without a doubt. Any more ammo or anything? Oh, whatever. Just don't die. Let's go. All right.

1001
05:39:25,669 --> 05:39:59,849
They come from over here. Yep. I think I did okay. I need a new gun. Okay. That looks good.

1002
05:40:00,569 --> 05:40:35,659
So now what? There it is. All right. Turn this shit on. Did it make it? Oh,

1003
05:40:37,110 --> 05:40:58,490
shit. I don't think we can confirm who actually died. Pay up. Somebody was lying on the ground

1004
05:41:00,330 --> 05:41:08,310
right at the beginning. I don't think we can confirm who it was. And then I died. Yeah. I

1005
05:41:08,310 --> 05:41:16,330
think we got a refund. Send it all back. There's only one line on the ground. We can't confirm.

1006
05:41:28,150 --> 05:41:41,450
Cool. Crazy shit in your last mission. It's what a Ryzen doesn't understand. Yeah. Just refund.

1007
05:41:41,450 --> 05:42:07,619
It's fine. All right. We got one more mission to do, but it is not going to be tonight.

1008
05:42:08,180 --> 05:42:15,529
I got to get out of here. I've got to do some stuff before it gets to be too late. I'll see

1009
05:42:15,529 --> 05:42:31,340
you guys on Tuesday. Tuesday at 1 PM Pacific. We're doing a big house flipper event somewhere

1010
05:42:31,340 --> 05:42:38,650
between 10 and 14 or so, 11 or 12 different people, different streamers. Everyone's going

1011
05:42:38,650 --> 05:42:44,169
to make a house at the same time. They have about an hour and 10, maybe minutes, hour and 20.

1012
05:42:44,169 --> 05:42:59,459
I'm going to get a tour of each house individually. Then after that, I'm going to be dipping out for

1013
05:42:59,459 --> 05:43:06,520
about four or five days. And you'll see me after Tuesday. I mean, you'll see me probably on the

1014
05:43:06,520 --> 05:43:14,340
weekend. We'll finish this up and we'll do some browser games. But 1 PM Pacific Tuesday, be there

1015
05:43:14,340 --> 05:43:18,630
if you want to see the house flipper stuff. There's going to be a lot of house flipper streams being

1016
05:43:18,709 --> 05:43:26,599
streamed. We're going to take the house flipper category, probably as high as possible, the

1017
05:43:26,599 --> 05:43:36,459
highest. I'm going to try to get it as high as it's ever been. We'll do the sunflowers on Tuesday

1018
05:43:36,459 --> 05:43:46,740
as well. Well, all right. Oh, squeaky voices. We're going to play with these later. Spooky mode.

1019
05:43:46,740 --> 05:43:52,900
Okay. There's some funny stuff here we'll do on this coming weekend. All right, buddy. See you

1020
05:43:52,900 --> 05:44:02,439
soon. See you tomorrow. See you Tuesday. Thanks for watching. Thanks for hanging out as always.

1021
05:44:04,619 --> 05:44:11,159
Sure, thanks. It was very fun. I highly recommend it. You can make this game as hard or as easy as

1022
05:44:11,159 --> 05:44:29,049
you want. I highly recommend it. BLT? That's right. I do have to eat the BLT still. Maybe soon. Maybe

1023
05:44:29,049 --> 05:44:42,950
later. Never would have thought I'd like it if you didn't show this game. Well, I'm glad you saw it.

1024
05:44:42,950 --> 05:44:56,979
Very fun. See you Tuesday. 1 PM Pacific. Write it down if you have to or not. You don't have to be

1025
05:44:56,979 --> 05:45:08,150
there if you don't want to. You can do whatever you do. Do whatever you're going to do on Tuesday.

1026
05:45:08,150 --> 05:46:18,860
See you soon. Take care. Call your mother. Call your father. See you Tuesday. See you later.
