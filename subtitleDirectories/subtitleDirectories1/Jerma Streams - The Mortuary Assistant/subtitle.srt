1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:14,339
Now, thanks to Myth for setting that up. Go follow Myth on YouTube. He's a really good dude.

2
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,250
That was a lot of fun. I wish I played a little better, but I was okay. Whatever.

3
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,309
You got popular on FPS games. That's, guys, go back and watch my scout tutorial where I explain

4
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:34,119
what A and D does. You understand? That's what I mean when I'm saying there was boogers coming

5
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:39,399
out of my nose. Like, okay, so A and D is a stray, right? That's, we're talking, it was a different

6
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:54,899
world 10 years ago. Okay. More? How do I spell this? Should I make my title Morty? Mortuary Morty?

7
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:04,120
I think I wanted that. I think I wanted that. I think it has to be that, right? Yeah. I don't

8
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:26,890
care. Yeah. It's going to be like, Morty. Mortuary. What do you think? Is that bad? Should I change it?

9
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:49,030
Dude, this is so bright in my fucking face. It's way too bright. Lights off too? Lights off? Well,

10
00:01:49,030 --> 00:02:22,710
this looks like shit. Why does it look so bad? Why do I look like I'm on a VHS tape? Does this

11
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:53,240
game suck? There we go. That's better. No, it's not. Is that better? That's good, right? Is that like

12
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:15,319
that? A little bit worse? I think that's fine. That's fine. All right. Mortuary Assistant. I know,

13
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,460
like, I hate Rick and Morty, but don't leave because you don't like the joke. Leave because

14
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,469
that was terrible at Call of Duty and you were, like, expecting something else. All right. Let's

15
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:44,250
go. Season six is coming soon. Why is this on my other monitor over here? Why is this over here?

16
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:52,889
This monitor. How do I change that? I don't want it on this monitor. I want it over here.

17
00:03:52,889 --> 00:04:08,860
How do I do that? Hey, what the fuck? Win, shift, and arrow. Win, shift, and arrow. I didn't do

18
00:04:08,860 --> 00:05:00,649
anything. I took it off full screen. There we go. All right. Can you see it? There we go. All right.

19
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:13,110
How does it look for settings? Is this fine? VSync 120. Let's go. This is probably fine.

20
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:22,220
Tutorial tips. Yeah. Ultra HD. High quality. I'll turn it up a little. Hopefully this is not,

21
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:34,540
like, a lot of screamers or something. All right. Okay. Move. Okay. Let's go. New shift.

22
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:46,089
Invert Y. It fixes a bug. Subtitles on. All right. Let's fucking go. New shift.

23
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:10,620
What happened to the POG content? I want to see Call of Duty. You missed it.

24
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:21,350
I'm so glad. Thank you. I'll never understand why you chose such a macabre field. There's nothing

25
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,459
disturbing about it. It's just that... I thought that was real actors.

26
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:44,660
They actually have everyone they need, but my old teacher, Mr. Delver, transferred me to his office

27
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,100
to finalize my internship there. Oh, well, that's good. I remember you mentioning him.

28
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,819
Where's he located? Are you moving away from me? No. It feels like an AI-generated scene.

29
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:02,579
He's actually located around here. Like, oh, in Blender. This is what's going to happen.

30
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,240
I don't like that. Grandma. Even I've heard things about that place.

31
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:14,470
Just be worried about you. Don't make up stories. Death is a scary thing to a lot of people,

32
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,870
and we try to explain things we don't understand, and we want comfort when we lose someone we love.

33
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,670
I mean, no one's embalming any ghost bodies or whatever. It's fine. Right, right. I'm sorry.

34
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,730
Bring!

35
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:37,480
Shit, that title is so bad. People are going to hate me. I'm actually regretting that title.

36
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:53,939
If I want that, just take it, please. It should be yours anyway. Thanks. All right.

37
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:59,579
Enough spooky stuff. I'm so proud of you. When is all this happening? When do you start?

38
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,310
I've actually been there for a few weeks now. My review is tomorrow.

39
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:23,029
What is happening? All right. Okay. I was like, what's going on? First day. Riverfield Mortuary.

40
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:47,899
This is loud. All right. Here we go. I feel like I'm playing Call of Duty again. Hold on.

41
00:08:52,169 --> 00:09:36,299
That did not work. I guess it's just the way it is. That's different now. That's better. Better

42
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:50,299
getting better. Halfway. Halfway. Halfway. All right. There we go. Okay. So what do we do?

43
00:09:50,299 --> 00:10:12,409
We can't break the vase. Okay. Rebecca, one last thing I forgot to give to you. Please grab a

44
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:21,830
pencil from my desk and sign it. Thanks. From Zoe. Good luck. Use to sign the paperwork on the

45
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:28,629
door. Access Quick Inventory and choose the item you wish to use. Most but not all places where

46
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:38,549
the I okay. That's the right mouse button. I can't use that here. Signed. All right.

47
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:08,629
Great. Perfect timing. I just finished with Mr. Dalton here. You're just sitting here? Please wheel

48
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:14,889
him back to cold storage and bring us Mrs. Page. Moving the deceased. Use the gurney by standing

49
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:19,450
behind it and pressing the gurney interact key and walk backwards with the gurney down the hall.

50
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:48,250
All right. Oh, where was there? Bring a body in or out of cold storage. Open the bay with the

51
00:11:48,250 --> 00:12:19,320
body's name. Pull out the rack and then move the cart over to it. Okay. Oswald Dalton. Oh. Oh,

52
00:12:19,320 --> 00:13:03,659
shit. Okay. Jesus. Okay. Get in there. Wait, is he just floating? How do I push him in? What happened?

53
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:38,250
Oh, shit. No, get over here. Come back. Come back. How do I? What do I do? How do I push him in?

54
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:54,500
What's what's going on? I don't understand what's going on here. He's he's he's literally stuck.

55
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:13,700
What? Okay. Pull this out. Then you put him in. He goes up. And then we put we put we what do we do?

56
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:20,649
I push him from here, right? Use the gurney. Get it out of the way and push him in. Dude, I tried.

57
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:37,289
That's literally what I tried doing before and it didn't work. He was frozen. Okay. I was clicking

58
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:51,460
and dragging. I swear to God. I was trying to find a sprint. Okay. All right. I'm just finishing

59
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,779
up something here. So why don't you grab the clipboard and start recording identifying marks.

60
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,259
I'll get out of your way when you're done and let you hop in here. Clipboard used for forms

61
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:09,220
and keeping track of mortuary tasks. All right. Okay. Record any distinguishing marks. Enter

62
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:17,159
markings into computer. Inspecting a body. Hover the cursor over unique markings such as moles,

63
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:23,879
scratches, bruises and interact with them to record them. Okay. All right. What do we got?

64
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:32,279
Got a ball here. All right. There's a mole. Wait. There's another one here.

65
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:53,500
Okay. Back up. Got a bruise. That's it. What about the head? These old windows never stay latched.

66
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:24,870
Nothing on the head. Wait. Keep going all the way. Bruise. Bruise. Great. Bruising. Climb on in

67
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,240
here and put everything into the record system. Don't forget to take the printout to the front

68
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:36,700
desk so Zo can add it to the packet for the family. After that, we'll get started. Okay.

69
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:46,340
Click the record system icon to open the program. What was that? I didn't say anything. You all

70
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:57,450
right? Yeah. I'm fine. Sorry. Okay. That was what a weirdo. All right. Click the record system icon

71
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,769
to open the program. Match the sections on your clipboard to the corresponding sections on the

72
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:07,609
computer. Once all findings have been entered into the system, click submit. Print out involving

73
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:13,049
records and file the records in whatever. All right. So he's going to match the system. Let's go.

74
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:22,920
Name. I don't... What's the name? Dorothy Page. Age. 87. Head. There was a...

75
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:36,490
On the right leg, there was a contusion. On the left leg, there was a rash. There was a contusion

76
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:45,690
on the left arm. There was a contusion on the right arm. On the right shoulder, there was a mole

77
00:17:46,410 --> 00:18:28,059
and that and that's it. Submit it. Okay. Where'd it go? Why were there clues over here?

78
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:36,740
Where did it print out from? I need to get it from the printer. Where's the printer?

79
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,900
Oh. All right. So I got to file up front so they are available if requested. All right. So we

80
00:18:42,900 --> 00:19:05,220
got to file this. Okay. Time to embalm. All right. I've set everything out so you can just go ahead

81
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:25,029
and get started. I'll be monitoring. Everything's on your list there if you need it. Pizza's burning.

82
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:33,289
There's no pizza in the oven. Okay. I'm ready to... So where do we do that? I'm missing something.

83
00:19:33,930 --> 00:20:00,440
Setting the face. Oh. What? Oh. Moisturizing wipe. Injector. I can't hold anything else.

84
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:16,890
Okay. I can only carry two large items at a time. Okay. So I need to use the injector, right?

85
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:30,009
I'm missing something. So I have in my... I don't need these... I don't need a moisturizing wipe.

86
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:39,579
Use for injecting cavity fluid directly into organs. Artery forceps. Scalpel. Just take

87
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:48,730
everything. Setting needles. Eye caps. IV reservoir bag. I can't hold anything else.

88
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:55,160
Okay. So I got to get this started, right? Oh. All right. Wire Josh up with needle

89
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:22,740
injector and settings needles. Am I doing this right? Holy shit. What did I just do?

90
00:21:22,740 --> 00:22:18,950
Oh. Wait. Do I double click it? There we go. Insert eye caps. Are they in? All right.

91
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:31,380
Okay. Mix embalming fluid. Gatorade, menthol, humectant, and formaldehyde.

92
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:50,339
Okay. Where is that? Okay. Cavity fluid. Mix embalming fluid and pump. Is it already in there?

93
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:57,450
No. Okay. Here it is. Okay. Take it. I can't hold anything else.

94
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,789
Really? How do I... How do I... How do I put this wipe down? How do I drop shit?

95
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:18,839
I can't hold anything else. Really? Get it back.

96
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:27,559
Sometimes we get chemicals that haven't been stored properly and it can make them pop like that.

97
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,680
Backpack. Just keep doing your thing. I'll get it.

98
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:43,160
I can't hold anything else. That was not normal.

99
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:53,799
I can't hold anything else. That sounded fucked up.

100
00:23:53,799 --> 00:24:27,880
All right. We'll put this shit in first. Okay. Hire the audio guy. I am. I genuinely am.

101
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,460
I am genuinely hiring an audio magician to give me... I don't care how much it costs.

102
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,200
It's not the noise gate. If I turn the noise gate off and scream, it'll still happen. It's

103
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,900
this microphone. Okay. I tested it with the noise gate off. I tested with no settings on it all.

104
00:24:46,900 --> 00:25:01,299
Just the mic plugged right into the computer. All right. So now I have to... How do I plug it in?

105
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:06,900
Make an incision in the cartoided artery and jugular vein. Okay.

106
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:18,710
Okay. So some items need to be used. What do I need to do with this?

107
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:33,579
Did I try to put the clipboard in her neck? I'm missing something.

108
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:47,819
Use forceps to clamp tubing to both veins. I need tubing. Where do I get the tubing?

109
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:59,480
Where are the forceps? Do I have the forceps? No. Where are the... Are the forceps already in there?

110
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:25,720
Where's the tube? The window? Window. Stop pretending. I don't... On the window sill.

111
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,279
Oh, this is a bag. This is like a... Okay. This is like a baggie.

112
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:38,200
I thought it was going to be like a big like snaked up thing. All right. Okay.

113
00:26:40,099 --> 00:27:49,059
Now engage pump and let the body drain. So subway for lunch. Turn it off.

114
00:27:52,779 --> 00:28:03,539
Wait, I didn't know I had to turn it off. I didn't know I had to turn it off. Please help.

115
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:20,809
Okay. Turn off pump. Remove tubes and close the incision.

116
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:39,500
Fill an empty reservoir bag with cavity fluid. Okay. Then... Then insert the trocar into the

117
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,539
cavity. Insert the trocar until it stops to begin the flow of embalming fluid.

118
00:28:44,539 --> 00:29:00,500
Once that cavity is full, hold the trocar back and rotate it. Then reinsert whatever.

119
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:26,789
Oh! I don't want anyone to do this to me. I don't want anyone to do this to me.

120
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:35,049
Shoot me out of a cannon. Just... Okay. Put me in a cannon and during... I have like a big celebration

121
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:40,740
where everybody's here. Like I've got family and friends. Load me into a gonzo cannon from the

122
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,650
Muppets and just have it be like tie a bunch of fireworks to me and just shoot me in the space

123
00:29:46,650 --> 00:30:00,410
and everyone just cheer. I don't... I don't want anyone to do this to me. No. High enough where

124
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:09,130
it's not going to be a problem. I'm talking about like... And I'm like in the stratosphere

125
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,329
and they just get to watch like this big and have it... I don't know. Have like a cool

126
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:25,480
display. Into orbit. No, not into orbit. Shoot me out of a fucking cannon. Don't do this to me.

127
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:46,599
Mix cleaners in bathroom closet to create tank cleaner. Okay. Cleaner base. Uh, more...

128
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:53,880
I can't hold anything else. I can't hold anything else. Is that it? Tank cleaner. What do I do?

129
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,380
Mix cleaners in bathroom closet to create tank cleaner. Then pour into the embalming pump.

130
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:14,890
I need an embalming pump. Where do I get that? You did it. How do I... That's not it. You just

131
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:25,220
used it. Turn it on. How do I turn it on? Drop the thing. You got the tank. Oh, okay. All right. I see

132
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:54,500
what you mean. And then what am I doing? And then pour into the embalming pump. Okay. Apply

133
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:28,680
moisturizer. Does it get more red? Okay. Moisturizer. Apply moisturizer. Okay. Yeah.

134
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:42,309
Wipe the face. Tell you what. Why don't you go ahead and head out? I'll take over from here.

135
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:52,259
Are you sure? I just got here. Don't worry. You're doing great. I'll get the last of your paperwork

136
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:58,579
sorted today and call you in for your first shift. All right. I'm ready. See you later.

137
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:21,829
That wasn't moisturizer. That was acid. It was just really weird. So some stuff fell over.

138
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:28,069
That's not a big deal. No, I know. It wasn't even my fault, but he sent me home right after that.

139
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:34,309
I'm just really worried. He was supposed to finalize my stuff today. And he said he would,

140
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:40,230
right? TV goes on top of that, right? You don't. That's where it places the TV. That's a good thing.

141
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,910
Yeah. It just didn't feel like he meant it. Like he just said it to get me out of the building.

142
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:54,039
Wait a sec. I have another call. Hello? Hey, Rebecca. It's Raymond. Oh, hi, Mr. Delver. Look,

143
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:18,360
if I did anything wrong today, just- No, no. What's this guy's problem? Yeah. Are you sure?

144
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:34,440
I mean, of course. Yeah. I don't want people sucking juices out of my body.

145
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:46,869
I'm on my way right now. I hope you feel better. Bye. Holy shit. That was him. He signed me on.

146
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:57,539
He needs me to come in tonight. Thanks. I have to go like right now. I'll talk to you later.

147
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:08,650
All right. Let's go. First day. First day of work. Okay. The sensitivity got worse.

148
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:18,840
You see that? That's scary. That's some scary shit. Why did it change that on me? And why is

149
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:30,710
there a microwave here? Why is there a microwave on the ground? This is an insane place for this.

150
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:57,369
Okay, let's go. Wolfios? Keys. All right. Temporary items do not take up space in your inventory.

151
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:16,099
All right. Morty. Morty. We're going to play more than one song, Morty. No, we're going to play more

152
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:39,719
than one song. That's not how it works, Morty. All right. Let's go. Holy fuck. Minus two. Yeah.

153
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,489
Look at the title. And everybody's talking shit about Rick and Morty. Like, you laugh at that

154
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:57,130
show. I know you do. You sit there with the iPad sitting on your chest, and they get into some

155
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:03,829
crazy hijinks, and you kind of go, all right. Okay. And then you slam the iPad shut because

156
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:06,469
you hear somebody come into the room. You don't want anyone to think you're watching it for some

157
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:34,940
reason. Who cares? What happened? I stubbed my toe. I'm telling you. I'm armed. Don't come in. I'm

158
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:54,360
armed. Mr. Delver. I need help. Someone's outside the mortuary. What? This is very sudden. But

159
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:00,940
listen to me. You have to start right away. He's on the phone. It's him. Sorry. He's going like that.

160
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,909
Oh, earbuds. This isn't funny. Stop. You need to take this seriously.

161
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:20,539
This is insane. I'll just leave. I'll just fucking leave. You can't leave, Rebecca. I can't allow

162
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:27,030
that for you or for others. It's far too dangerous. What am I supposed to do then?

163
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:34,070
Most bodies I work with at night are fine. So we stay. What happened to my chat? I can't read the

164
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:45,829
chat. The embalm. File the paperwork. Stay. I left some things for you on the desk. I'll call again

165
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:52,599
when you get to the embalm. All right. This is where I'm going to go like this. No, wait. This is insane.

166
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,119
Oh, that's supposed to be him. I was going to just go like this, like jump at him. This is so stupid.

167
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:03,940
It's just some hazing for the new girl or something. Just turn that back. Turn that back on.

168
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:16,900
What are you doing? And do your job. Oh, what the fuck? You're right. The ghost is here. You're

169
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:23,719
right. You should definitely come in here. It's fucked up in here, man. And then when it comes in,

170
00:39:23,719 --> 00:40:01,300
club them with the fucking bowling pin. All right, let's go. Key, key, save recorder. Okay. How do I

171
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:32,230
get? That's not it. Quitting tomorrow. I'm going to break through the windows. I'm sorry, but this

172
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:38,389
entire thing is extremely unprofessional. If this is how you treat new hires, I don't think I can

173
00:40:38,389 --> 00:41:45,300
work for you. Don't trust the phones. Anything can be manipulated. Burn the correct body.

174
00:41:47,510 --> 00:42:03,510
What? In this cabinet? This is insane. Just be a professional one. Grab a body and get started.

175
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,789
This is the part where I take the tennis ball and I just don't know what to do.

176
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:15,699
So I sit over there in the corner and I go like, can't go, can't go. Fucking demons. Can't go.

177
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:30,840
Somewhere. I just sit there for like 10 minutes. He could have just stayed on the phone.

178
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,619
Oh, shit. That was important.

179
00:42:54,099 --> 00:43:05,690
The further you are from possession, the more time you have. The closer you are,

180
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:08,730
the more the demon will find the demon's name. All right, find the demon's name.

181
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:16,250
Allowing you information to guess its name and the body. It's about the only way.

182
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:24,619
Fucking Eric. It's Eric. Don't think of just scribble.

183
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:34,260
Notice anything strange? It's starting to go past the pencil in the desk.

184
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:46,010
Checking from time to time can give an idea. It's Eric.

185
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:12,150
Just burn them all. Yeah, what's stopping me from just burning all of them and being like, hey,

186
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:22,070
I just burned them all. I got the demon. Wait, should I not be doing this? Just burn them all.

187
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:26,949
No, no, you're supposed to listen to all the tapes. No, you know, you're not doing it right.

188
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:55,210
Hey, Mr. Dover.

189
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:41,900
He's like, you didn't play my game. What the fuck? Is it over? That was it. Do I have a save?

190
00:45:41,900 --> 00:46:01,900
Oh, God damn it. All right. All right. Don't just be an idiot. Keys. Let's go. All right. Let's go.

191
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:41,960
I'm not messing around right now. Doesn't he call? I thought he doesn't. He calls. Doesn't he call?

192
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:24,869
What's the code? This one's got like Cheeto dust on it. It's this one.

193
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:38,420
Okay. Okay. Where did he say that was? I forgot immediately. Instantly. I forgot what he said.

194
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:45,510
My ID is. Where is it? He said my ID is the drawer or something.

195
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:31,980
Think about just script. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, get away from me.

196
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,460
If you notice anything strange, it's starting to take hold. Okay. What are you? There's a notepad

197
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:50,329
and a pencil on desk. Checking from time to time. Okay. Embalm each body with a special

198
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:55,369
regent from the cabinet. Use the leading strips from the cabinet to attempt to reveal demonic

199
00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:22,019
sigils. Okay. So we got to get a body out. Okay. All right. So we got to get a body

200
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:43,130
and we just have to do the process of embalming. All right. It's not. Oh, it's a different name.

201
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:53,400
Robert Hood. Nothing. Cordell Armstrong. Dorothy Vaughn. Okay. Dorothy Vaughn. Come on out.

202
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:26,579
Yeah. It's random. All right. Okay. Just leave. I'm not gonna just leave. All right. Here we go.

203
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:31,449
We need to do. All right. You've got something going on. Do I need to do this?

204
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:59,420
Head bruise. A couple of head bruises. All right. What about the arm? Yep. All right. Nothing here.

205
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:21,219
Anything here? Nope. Somebody just tapped on the window. What? Is that it? I think that's it.

206
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:41,900
That's it, right? Okay. Name. Age 22. Contusion in the head. Right shoulder. There's a problem.

207
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:56,599
Rash on the arm. And that's it. Submit it. Let's go. Okay. Give me the cabinet. What the fuck is this?

208
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,369
What is this?

209
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,159
Location. You will need to uncover these sigils to use them.

210
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,800
Hold a letting strip up while wandering the mortuary. If it begins to smolder and burn,

211
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,079
you're close. When the paper will bust. It's here. It's right in front of me.

212
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:30,699
What? This thing's fucking burning. Ow. Where is it? Are you out here? Use the night shift database

213
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:52,340
to decide what reagent. Am I getting close? I don't wait. I don't get it.

214
00:53:53,460 --> 00:54:07,909
This is. Ow. What? I don't understand. What? How would it just happen? This person's a demon.

215
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:31,619
Sigil revealed. Where? Look for the mark now. Mark of Satan. Where's the mark? No, no, no, no, no,

216
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:43,820
no. Turn the lights off. I don't see anything on the furniture in the room on the furniture

217
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:59,260
on the wall. Can it just be anywhere? Like that? It was just like, oh,

218
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,980
right here, right? It burnt up like right here. It can be, it can be anywhere.

219
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:13,739
It's near, it has to be near where it burned, right? It blew up right here.

220
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:27,130
Stop. Where is it? Look on the wall. Dude, I'm looking at the wall. I'm looking at the wall right

221
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:51,989
now. Sink. Please stop pretending. I have no idea what this wants me to do. I lifted up the thing.

222
00:55:51,989 --> 00:56:00,219
It burnt. It exploded right here. And I'm so. Oh my fucking God. I thought this was a clock.

223
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:14,070
OK, so that's that's the sigil. So OK, now I have that. So let's go over here.

224
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:24,389
So what is now? What? What mark is that? This one here?

225
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:51,539
It's like, yeah, it's like the L. OK, so I have to get I got to get four of these.

226
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:59,909
Load it, hurry. OK, in invidious emulation, desolation.

227
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:10,980
OK, so we've got Baraketh. Who else has an L? T-Shack. I need I need more.

228
00:57:11,539 --> 00:57:15,400
Let's go. Let's go light some more papers. All right.

229
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,199
All right. Let's light a paper and let's go find a something.

230
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:41,610
Let's go. I need more progress first. All right. Let's start.

231
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:49,670
All right. So I need to. All right. Enter markings into computer.

232
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:58,380
Didn't I already do that? Yeah, this is already submitted. I got I got to file it.

233
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:09,849
It's time to involve.

234
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:14,710
Why are you saying that that like it was a superpower you were activating?

235
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:23,260
Like that was weird. Time to embalm missing something.

236
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:30,119
All right. I need to do the. Where is all this shit?

237
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:33,320
OK, wire, needle injector and setting needles.

238
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:39,610
I don't know where all this stuff even is. Needle injector.

239
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:47,000
Are the lights off in here? No. All right. Where the needles?

240
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:55,909
It's not a tutorial anymore. Moisturizers here, right?

241
00:58:55,909 --> 00:59:03,159
These needles. What the fuck is this? Oh, the glass cabinet. OK.

242
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:09,849
Needle injector. All right. Setting needles. Let's do it.

243
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:28,969
OK. Well, I got to be honest. What is the point of doing this?

244
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:32,489
What's the point of doing this? Why? Why? What's it for?

245
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:36,550
Why? Why do that? Why? Why are the person's jaw shut?

246
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:50,500
It keeps the mouth closed so they don't have their mouths open.

247
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,179
All right. I need eye caps. Why did you let me die?

248
00:59:54,179 --> 01:00:14,599
What the fuck is this? This is all your fault.

249
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:22,969
At every second with you, time is running out, Rebecca.

250
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:39,690
OK. Insert eye caps. Where are the eye caps?

251
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:45,989
I don't really know. Eye caps. They weren't in here.

252
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:52,250
Scalpel. I'm going to pick it up just to have it. Little scissors.

253
01:00:54,420 --> 01:01:05,820
Eye caps. Yeah. All right. Let's go. Put them on.

254
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:12,059
I can't use that here. Put them on.

255
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:18,280
You have to click the eyes. Oh, OK.

256
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:25,829
All right. Now we do the embalming fluid, which is all the chemicals.

257
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:36,059
This is humectant, hydrogen, whatever. No, no, no.

258
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:40,260
They don't put that in. I can't hold anything else.

259
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:57,849
God, why? OK. Formaldehyde.

260
01:01:58,809 --> 01:02:09,610
The other stuff over here. One of those.

261
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:13,829
What? And then what's the last one?

262
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:23,989
Glutaraldehyde. OK. Where's the Glutaraldehyde?

263
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:43,449
Mix it up. Oh, wait. I need a reagent in the old cabinet.

264
01:02:43,449 --> 01:02:56,260
OK. And now we're going to connect. Yep.

265
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:13,380
I'm missing something. I need the tube.

266
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:28,329
All right. Let's go. Turn it on.

267
01:03:28,329 --> 01:04:06,460
Oh, hey, Satan. Where is it? Oh, Satan.

268
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:18,730
OK. That's like a big three right here. All right.

269
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:21,750
So we've got three L. What's three L?

270
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:29,099
L. Looking for L3. L3. L3. No.

271
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:40,389
L3. No. It's going to be emulation.

272
01:04:41,699 --> 01:04:45,300
L3. L. Ah, it's. I know. I know their name.

273
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,539
I know your name. I know. I know. It's Anek.

274
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:50,980
It's Anek. Look right there. Anek.

275
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,340
All right. So what do I do? How do I say their name?

276
01:04:53,340 --> 01:05:00,010
So now I know it's Anek. Oh, I have to put it in the thing.

277
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:07,610
OK. L3. T9. L3. T9.

278
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:10,679
Wait, it's going to be the right order.

279
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:21,719
It's L3. T9. L3. T9.

280
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:31,110
L3. T9. Like that, right?

281
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:59,110
L3. T9. Take it. Now what do I do with this?

282
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:02,550
Wait, attach it to body somehow, then burn it after?

283
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:06,150
You have to put it on the correct body, though.

284
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:13,210
Oh, OK. Why is this body possessed?

285
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:17,860
You're right. OK, I don't know, but I know it's that one.

286
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:21,989
All right. So now this is embalmed.

287
01:06:21,989 --> 01:06:24,389
Fill an empty reservoir bag with cavity fluid. OK.

288
01:06:24,389 --> 01:06:31,639
Hold anything else? Yes, you can.

289
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:36,980
Oh, my God, by this way. Put it back.

290
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:55,670
OK, then this goes in here. Start scribbling.

291
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:59,269
Where? Where do I write this down?

292
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:01,030
Where? Where? Where? Where? Write anything.

293
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:15,099
How do I write something down? On a desk?

294
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:34,860
That's nothing. I left a coffee mug on a piece of wood.

295
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:48,739
But that doesn't do anything. C. OK, keep this up.

296
01:07:49,300 --> 01:08:13,989
There we go. OK, now mix cleaner in the bathroom.

297
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:26,460
I'm scared. Where's the bathroom? Right here, right?

298
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:40,300
Where's the bathroom? This is not the bathroom.

299
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:52,939
Where's the bathroom? Oh, it's right here.

300
01:08:52,939 --> 01:09:14,489
OK, I got it. Any weird shit? Just a double check, right?

301
01:09:14,489 --> 01:09:53,300
What was that? OK, apply moisturizer.

302
01:10:01,369 --> 01:10:07,369
Right. Return body to cold storage.

303
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:30,779
OK, there's only two more bodies. What's that?

304
01:10:30,779 --> 01:10:52,010
That's just a square. OK, let's go.

305
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:56,539
All right, who's next? All right, Cordell Armstrong.

306
01:10:56,539 --> 01:11:03,140
Come on out. Let's go.

307
01:11:11,899 --> 01:11:17,060
It starts with a C. It does start with a C, you're right.

308
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:34,840
That's true. OK, it's definitely this guy.

309
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:40,619
Without a doubt. It's 100% this guy.

310
01:11:40,619 --> 01:12:06,779
This guy's smiling. Yeah, it's definitely this guy.

311
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:15,220
That hit? The head. OK, got it all.

312
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:27,100
All right, put it in the computer. Entry two.

313
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,979
This is Cordell Armstrong, age 53, head.

314
01:12:32,539 --> 01:12:34,220
Got that thing on it. Right shoulder.

315
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:43,029
We've got these left arm, lemmishes, right arm, curatolas, right leg.

316
01:12:43,029 --> 01:13:09,779
Got a mole. Submit. Hey, let's go.

317
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:17,430
OK, let's do it again. Oh, it's this guy.

318
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:23,659
It's this fucking guy. Look at this.

319
01:13:23,659 --> 01:13:24,939
I'm going to put the thing in his mouth and he's.

320
01:13:37,779 --> 01:13:43,510
There we go. OK, then it's eye caps.

321
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:49,430
Does it down here? What's after eye caps?

322
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:52,250
Embalming fluid. Let's just get this done now.

323
01:13:52,250 --> 01:14:00,869
All right. OK, embalming fluid.

324
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:05,939
It's this shit, this shit.

325
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:17,159
And then it's this shit. And then it's this shit.

326
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:22,010
Where is it? That's turning into something else now.

327
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:31,159
Menthol. Where's menthol? Where's that menthol?

328
01:14:31,159 --> 01:14:37,800
Where's that menthol? No, where is it?

329
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:42,300
I forget where it is. Over here?

330
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:50,390
Yep. OK, it's on the shelf. I remember that.

331
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,390
And the other chemical right here.

332
01:14:52,390 --> 01:15:03,939
OK, now we're going to attach the tubing, which is here.

333
01:15:04,819 --> 01:15:10,869
I need the stabbers, scalpel, or sips tubing.

334
01:15:10,869 --> 01:15:21,659
That tube is over here. Isn't it?

335
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:32,340
Yeah. No, you're not.

336
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,380
You're fine. All right.

337
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:40,970
Turn it on. Quick scribble, scribble.

338
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:47,189
Input system error. Action acid cannot be found.

339
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:49,050
If you're experiencing this error for the first time,

340
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:53,180
locate a poisonous material, ingest and wait for heart rate to slow.

341
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:55,800
Your flesh is wasted. Give it to me.

342
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,399
Let me in. My glorious pleasures ache to flood your veins.

343
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:03,319
As you rot in torment for your sin, there is no hope, Rebecca.

344
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:04,760
You will see me, Rebecca.

345
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:13,460
It's a very odd Windows blue screen. OK.

346
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:22,649
Drink poison? Where's poison? I gotta drink it.

347
01:16:22,649 --> 01:16:24,409
Where's poison? Drink poison quick.

348
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:43,590
Hey, what the fuck was that thing?

349
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:53,899
It's an Enderman. Where's poison?

350
01:17:10,569 --> 01:17:22,819
What do I do? Wait, what's that?

351
01:17:22,819 --> 01:17:47,930
Heroin kit. Wait, heroin? I'm going to do heroin?

352
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:54,380
Grab the keys. Nothing on this table is interactable.

353
01:17:54,380 --> 01:18:08,979
No keys here. I just leave.

354
01:18:08,979 --> 01:18:45,779
Oh, that's not good. Jesus.

355
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:46,739
Oh, yeah. Where are you?

356
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:01,399
Oh, yep. We got the right one.

357
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:03,000
Absolutely got the right one.

358
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,439
Yep. No way. It's not the right one.

359
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:12,500
It's anic. That's absolutely anic.

360
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:16,939
Yep. L3T9. We got it.

361
01:19:16,939 --> 01:19:22,229
L3T9. That's it.

362
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:23,510
But is this the right person?

363
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:30,949
How can we tell if it's the right person, though?

364
01:19:30,949 --> 01:19:33,189
If I put it on. Oh, what if I if I put it on?

365
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:43,529
Will it start to like burn? Wait, pump them.

366
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:58,310
You're right. OK. So what's that?

367
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:08,539
It's like a U. Is it a D or a G?

368
01:20:29,529 --> 01:20:30,649
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

369
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:35,159
OK. Turn. Remove the tubes.

370
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:35,880
Close the incision.

371
01:20:44,100 --> 01:21:10,359
Now we need to do the reservoir bag with cavity fluid, which is over here.

372
01:21:10,359 --> 01:21:24,729
Check the computer again. There we go.

373
01:21:25,369 --> 01:21:34,600
OK. I'll check the computer.

374
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,359
OK. History. Identifying demonic tenacity.

375
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:43,819
Well, learning the name of the demonic entity is more about waiting.

376
01:21:43,819 --> 01:21:47,479
Identifying which body is experiencing demonic tenacity

377
01:21:47,479 --> 01:21:49,319
requires paying close attention.

378
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:51,699
While any of the bodies can be manipulated,

379
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:54,420
it is far easier for the entity to control its own vessel.

380
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,060
Sudden movements, large or small, can be a sign of tenacity.

381
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:03,739
If a body appears to be more active than others, a strange markings start to appear.

382
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:11,699
OK. The appearance of new markings on the body.

383
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,859
Sudden movements. Repeat movements.

384
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:19,510
Sudden movements.

385
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:29,909
This working? Yeah, this thing is huge.

386
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:36,220
I guess, um, this is David.

387
01:22:36,939 --> 01:22:41,239
Raymond, this feels insane, but I think you were right.

388
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:46,359
This has happened a few times now, but let me see if I can get in here.

389
01:22:55,300 --> 01:23:16,949
All right. Shut up. Shut up.

390
01:23:21,609 --> 01:23:22,090
Whatever.

391
01:23:24,659 --> 01:23:26,260
I'm going to burn this guy. I'm burning this guy.

392
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,520
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

393
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Circle. Circle.

394
01:23:39,979 --> 01:23:42,649
You sure?

395
01:23:58,039 --> 01:24:00,039
Well, this is dark in here. Right on.

396
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:19,020
All right. Clean the bathroom.

397
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,859
See? Oh, I mean, it's definitely see.

398
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:36,579
Oh, see, this is this guy named like corn something smiling.

399
01:24:36,579 --> 01:25:04,409
It's definitely this guy missing something.

400
01:25:04,409 --> 01:25:10,100
I'm putting this on his head. Is it not you?

401
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:14,710
When to be sure this is. Oh, yeah, absolutely.

402
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:16,310
Yeah, 100 percent. Let's go.

403
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:18,310
You're going in the fucking toilet and wherever you're going.

404
01:25:19,529 --> 01:25:22,250
I'm missing something. OK, it's this guy for real.

405
01:25:24,789 --> 01:25:26,310
Well, we're going to moisturize the face.

406
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,649
Because that's we have to finish that right.

407
01:25:30,649 --> 01:25:42,739
I can't use that here. All right.

408
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,399
What if it's don't trust yourself?

409
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:55,779
OK. All right. Back into the freezer.

410
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,260
Of course, it's this guy. It's this.

411
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:18,100
Are you serious? It's this guy.

412
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,539
It's this guy. I got to burn him.

413
01:26:19,539 --> 01:26:20,899
How do I burn him? What do I do?

414
01:26:20,899 --> 01:26:21,779
Do I have any holy water?

415
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:32,220
I thought there's the eyes looking at me.

416
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:36,060
Those are red eyes. Get over here.

417
01:26:36,619 --> 01:26:39,479
I get. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

418
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:40,520
I got to put the thing on you.

419
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:44,260
I can't use that here.

420
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:45,859
Mark them. Mark them. Mark them quick.

421
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,579
How do I get them in here?

422
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,159
I can't move them. Why not?

423
01:27:38,939 --> 01:27:44,729
Bye. See you later.

424
01:27:46,119 --> 01:27:48,359
Annec. Your name is Annec.

425
01:27:48,359 --> 01:27:49,800
Annec. Your name is Annec.

426
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:53,659
Back to the shadow demon realm with you.

427
01:27:53,659 --> 01:27:56,220
Your name is Annec. Your name is Annec.

428
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,760
What? Why is he still alive?

429
01:28:25,319 --> 01:28:36,069
I got him. No, I got him.

430
01:29:05,779 --> 01:29:09,899
It doesn't end here from now on.

431
01:29:09,899 --> 01:29:12,460
There is always a chance this will happen again.

432
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,869
No matter where you are.

433
01:29:14,869 --> 01:29:17,689
I don't want this. I just want to leave.

434
01:29:17,689 --> 01:29:19,529
By the way. Yes, it is.

435
01:29:19,529 --> 01:29:21,130
It is eight dollars an hour.

436
01:29:30,869 --> 01:29:34,229
So what? You're waging some selfless holy war.

437
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:37,529
It's not a war. It's survival.

438
01:29:37,529 --> 01:29:39,430
And I'd hardly call it selfless.

439
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,319
We're caught at the front line of something larger.

440
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:45,239
But I don't do this for some greater good.

441
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,199
We either face it or fall to it.

442
01:29:50,409 --> 01:29:52,329
I wish I could claim to be someone better.

443
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:55,210
Suffering hell to save us all.

444
01:29:55,210 --> 01:29:59,350
But I simply want to live another day just like everyone else.

445
01:29:59,909 --> 01:30:00,949
So did I win?

446
01:30:00,949 --> 01:30:04,149
When I first experienced this, I had to make a choice.

447
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:08,260
I could run and spend the rest of my days in fear.

448
01:30:08,899 --> 01:30:12,659
Or I could learn to face it and keep some semblance of a normal life.

449
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:13,939
That was pretty cool.

450
01:30:14,739 --> 01:30:19,979
It's not a life I would want for anyone.

451
01:30:19,979 --> 01:30:23,539
But choosing between a life of fear or control.

452
01:30:26,039 --> 01:30:29,399
You're the first person I've met to face this hell and survive.

453
01:30:30,409 --> 01:30:31,529
So there are five endings.

454
01:30:31,529 --> 01:30:32,489
Different kind of job.

455
01:30:32,489 --> 01:30:35,319
Let's go work the night shift.

456
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,800
Learn what I know.

457
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:42,890
Give yourself a chance at a life beyond fear.

458
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:47,689
I don't know what you experienced, but I know it uses the worst parts of you against yourself.

459
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:52,329
The more things happen, the more you'll confront the darkest parts of your life.

460
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:57,640
But through it, you'll become unbreakable.

461
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,800
I'm offering the tools to take control.

462
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:02,039
The choice is yours.

463
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:05,000
Hope you come back.

464
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,640
This game's cool.

465
01:31:08,619 --> 01:31:13,560
It was not really what I was expecting, but it was kind of what I was expecting.

466
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:19,210
Time's possessed.

467
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:27,130
Wait, so that was when I was in the apartment?

468
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:27,850
Oh, okay.

469
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:28,810
That's cool.

470
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:32,279
Should I do one more?

471
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:34,630
I'll do one more.

472
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:40,939
Now that I understand how the game works, I'll try to do one a little cleaner.

473
01:31:40,939 --> 01:31:42,699
And then I'll take off after this.

474
01:31:42,699 --> 01:31:44,659
I'll be live tomorrow.

475
01:31:44,659 --> 01:31:52,069
Tomorrow we're going to play Two Point Campus.

476
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:02,300
All right, let's go.

477
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,020
So I get it now.

478
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:03,979
I know how it works.

479
01:32:03,979 --> 01:32:06,739
What time tomorrow?

480
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,779
Um, I'll probably be starting.

481
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:13,140
I want to say maybe two or three, maybe.

482
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:16,229
I'll put the steps what I want.

483
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:18,149
Maybe two o'clock, three o'clock.

484
01:32:18,149 --> 01:32:23,020
All right, let's make this quicker.

485
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:41,079
Let's get to it.

486
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:41,800
Who do we got?

487
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:50,949
We have Brandy Cooper, Nick Darlington, and Rufus Harrell.

488
01:32:50,949 --> 01:32:52,229
Let's do Rufus first.

489
01:32:52,949 --> 01:32:54,340
When is baseball?

490
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:59,670
Baseball is August 19th at 6 30 p.m.

491
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:01,979
Oh, no, sorry.

492
01:33:02,899 --> 01:33:04,659
At 4 30 p.m.

493
01:33:04,659 --> 01:33:05,699
Yeah, sorry.

494
01:33:05,699 --> 01:33:06,500
I had it wrong.

495
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,750
I don't know why I said six.

496
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,270
It's 4 30 p.m.

497
01:33:10,649 --> 01:33:12,569
Not 6 30, 4 30.

498
01:33:12,569 --> 01:33:19,659
What am I stuck on?

499
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:20,380
Get out of the way.

500
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:22,579
What am I stuck on?

501
01:33:22,579 --> 01:33:26,500
Yeah, 4 30 p.m.

502
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:26,899
Pacific.

503
01:33:28,439 --> 01:33:29,239
Why can't this not move?

504
01:33:29,239 --> 01:33:30,680
I don't have my clipboard.

505
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:35,430
I have to go in backwards?

506
01:33:36,229 --> 01:33:38,710
4 30 p.m.

507
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:39,189
Pacific.

508
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:45,819
All right, come on out.

509
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:49,979
Let's get lucky and have a B first try here.

510
01:33:49,979 --> 01:34:21,699
All right, let's go.

511
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:23,479
What do you got?

512
01:34:23,479 --> 01:34:27,289
I only need my clipboard.

513
01:34:27,289 --> 01:34:30,649
At least I can keep track of things.

514
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:36,840
Am I laughing?

515
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,329
You heard it.

516
01:34:38,329 --> 01:34:57,270
Somebody just came in.

517
01:34:57,270 --> 01:35:07,140
Wait, this is scratch.

518
01:35:17,529 --> 01:35:18,569
There we go.

519
01:35:18,569 --> 01:35:24,090
All right.

520
01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:26,939
This is Rufus 35.

521
01:35:27,579 --> 01:35:29,380
Flemish's leg.

522
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:30,340
We got nothing.

523
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:30,899
Show right.

524
01:35:32,739 --> 01:35:35,750
This right left shoulder.

525
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:37,510
Nothing left arm is a mole.

526
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:39,529
Right arm contusion.

527
01:35:39,529 --> 01:35:41,529
Right leg abrasion.

528
01:35:41,529 --> 01:35:58,409
Anything weird in here already?

529
01:35:58,409 --> 01:36:13,670
All right, start it.

530
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:18,500
All right, we need the wiring.

531
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:21,770
I already forgot where all the tools are.

532
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,659
They're down here or something, right?

533
01:36:25,659 --> 01:36:27,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

534
01:36:28,359 --> 01:36:42,949
Is anybody eating to this stream?

535
01:36:42,949 --> 01:36:47,829
I feel like it'd be hard.

536
01:36:47,829 --> 01:36:48,390
There we go.

537
01:36:51,289 --> 01:36:52,250
Eye caps.

538
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:57,590
I mean, actually, pizza would be pretty easy.

539
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:58,949
Yeah, I could do pizza.

540
01:36:58,949 --> 01:37:08,420
You could eat pizza no matter what.

541
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:10,420
You can't get grossed out while you're eating pizza.

542
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,000
All right.

543
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:19,590
All right, we need all the embalming fluid now here.

544
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:24,939
You've used that one already.

545
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:26,840
That one sucks.

546
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,039
Start fires.

547
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,420
Start moving other shit besides knocking on the door.

548
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:33,819
What a shitty ghost.

549
01:37:33,819 --> 01:37:36,010
What a terrible ghost.

550
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:37,369
Oh, I'm knocking on the door.

551
01:37:37,369 --> 01:37:37,930
Yeah.

552
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:39,529
What amateur bullshit that is.

553
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:46,020
Start breaking glass and then we'll talk.

554
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:58,359
Oh, this one.

555
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,800
I need the notepad.

556
01:38:13,619 --> 01:38:20,100
Notepad's in the other room.

557
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:20,819
It's him.

558
01:38:20,819 --> 01:38:21,699
It's you.

559
01:38:21,699 --> 01:38:22,739
It's you.

560
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:23,380
It's you.

561
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:27,590
I need my fucking notepad so I can write that shit down.

562
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:45,029
Where's the...

563
01:38:45,029 --> 01:38:49,289
I always forget where this one is.

564
01:38:49,289 --> 01:38:58,970
Over here.

565
01:38:58,970 --> 01:38:59,609
Oh, shit.

566
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:18,979
Write something besides a scribble, dude.

567
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,479
You can't do anything else but that?

568
01:39:25,479 --> 01:39:28,010
That was me in there.

569
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:28,649
That was fucked up.

570
01:39:28,649 --> 01:39:30,039
All right.

571
01:39:30,039 --> 01:39:33,770
All right, turn the machine on.

572
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:34,170
Oh, no.

573
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:36,250
I mean, I need the magical stuff.

574
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:41,829
Okay.

575
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:43,109
Put that away.

576
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:44,550
Let's go ahead and cut this.

577
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:45,819
I need the pipe.

578
01:39:45,819 --> 01:39:49,050
I'm missing something.

579
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:08,699
Give me a note.

580
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:10,439
Give me a note.

581
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:11,720
Something in here, right?

582
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,439
Come on.

583
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:12,939
Yeah.

584
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:14,779
Where you at?

585
01:40:18,149 --> 01:40:18,470
Okay.

586
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:18,949
It's a Z.

587
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:28,170
We need another one.

588
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:37,829
We can't go off of that one.

589
01:40:37,829 --> 01:40:38,979
All right.

590
01:40:38,979 --> 01:40:39,859
Get the tubes out.

591
01:40:46,409 --> 01:40:53,180
You got another thing for me already?

592
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,460
Actually, it's Zed.

593
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:57,109
That's fine.

594
01:40:57,109 --> 01:40:57,350
Okay.

595
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:59,109
Now we need to do the reservoir bag.

596
01:40:59,109 --> 01:41:00,619
Is it over here?

597
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:09,189
And then that goes into the...

598
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:09,829
Oh, yeah.

599
01:41:09,829 --> 01:41:10,789
This thing was here.

600
01:41:10,789 --> 01:41:33,380
You got something to say?

601
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:38,869
All right.

602
01:41:38,869 --> 01:41:39,270
Where is it?

603
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:41,130
Z?

604
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,560
A bird?

605
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:46,199
It looks like a bird.

606
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:57,689
Let's take a look.

607
01:41:57,689 --> 01:41:58,329
Oh, come on.

608
01:41:58,329 --> 01:41:59,130
What's the password?

609
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,140
9187.

610
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:15,189
Okay.

611
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:17,239
It's...

612
01:42:17,239 --> 01:42:17,560
What was it?

613
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,359
What were the two symbols?

614
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:18,859
Bird and...

615
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:22,409
Bird and Z.

616
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:22,890
All right.

617
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:23,289
It could be...

618
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,779
Baldmet.

619
01:42:26,779 --> 01:42:27,340
Wait.

620
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:35,579
Is that the right one?

621
01:42:35,579 --> 01:42:40,569
The wrong Z?

622
01:42:40,569 --> 01:42:41,449
Could be...

623
01:42:41,449 --> 01:42:42,949
Shadat?

624
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:44,229
That's the right one, right?

625
01:42:44,229 --> 01:42:45,029
Bird and Z.

626
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:46,600
Okay.

627
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:47,399
Shadat?

628
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:53,050
I think it's that one.

629
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:55,670
Let's check the other ones.

630
01:42:55,670 --> 01:43:08,250
Shadat?

631
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:10,010
Yep.

632
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:10,890
Shadat.

633
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:12,069
This one here.

634
01:43:12,069 --> 01:43:12,789
NVIDIUS.

635
01:43:12,789 --> 01:43:13,590
Shadat.

636
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:15,899
We just got to confirm that with a three

637
01:43:15,899 --> 01:43:17,819
and another little symbol here.

638
01:43:17,819 --> 01:43:19,130
So wait.

639
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:19,770
Let me get this right.

640
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:32,090
So there's bird, Z on the left.

641
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:32,729
Okay.

642
01:43:32,729 --> 01:43:37,609
All right.

643
01:43:37,609 --> 01:43:38,010
Something happened.

644
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:38,649
Something happened here.

645
01:43:39,529 --> 01:43:43,609
What's left?

646
01:43:43,609 --> 01:43:44,170
I have to...

647
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:45,449
Oh, yeah.

648
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:46,409
This thing.

649
01:43:46,409 --> 01:43:51,819
I was doing this.

650
01:43:51,819 --> 01:43:51,979
C.

651
01:43:52,619 --> 01:43:59,819
There we go.

652
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:01,699
Okay.

653
01:44:01,699 --> 01:44:03,380
Then mix the cleaners in the bathroom

654
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,659
and then do the face moisturizer.

655
01:44:04,899 --> 01:44:35,539
Can we move?

656
01:44:35,539 --> 01:44:39,619
I can't use that here.

657
01:44:39,619 --> 01:44:46,090
Why not?

658
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:46,890
Hurry up.

659
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:53,880
All right.

660
01:44:53,880 --> 01:45:02,970
Let's go.

661
01:45:02,970 --> 01:45:03,609
I can't make it.

662
01:45:03,609 --> 01:45:04,010
I can't.

663
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:04,649
I don't know.

664
01:45:04,649 --> 01:45:05,210
It could be...

665
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:05,689
It could be.

666
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:10,409
He was looking at himself though.

667
01:45:10,409 --> 01:45:11,449
His eyes just opened.

668
01:45:11,449 --> 01:45:13,399
His eyes are just...

669
01:45:13,399 --> 01:45:14,939
His eyes are opened.

670
01:45:14,939 --> 01:45:15,100
Wait.

671
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:15,739
Did they?

672
01:45:15,739 --> 01:45:29,779
His eyes opened.

673
01:45:29,779 --> 01:45:30,739
This is Rufus.

674
01:45:39,850 --> 01:45:40,090
It's...

675
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:40,329
Yeah.

676
01:45:40,329 --> 01:45:41,449
It's definitely this guy.

677
01:45:43,989 --> 01:45:44,630
Well, let's...

678
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,350
We'll confirm it.

679
01:45:47,939 --> 01:46:01,909
He's got scratches, man.

680
01:46:01,909 --> 01:46:03,109
It's definitely this guy.

681
01:46:03,109 --> 01:46:03,510
I'm just gonna...

682
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:04,550
I think I'm just gonna go for it.

683
01:46:13,029 --> 01:46:13,989
I'll try one more person.

684
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:15,270
But I really...

685
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:16,390
I actually think it really is him.

686
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:29,399
Is it you?

687
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:32,039
Brandy?

688
01:46:32,600 --> 01:47:13,210
She's waiting and looking for movements.

689
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:17,460
Hey.

690
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:19,460
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

691
01:47:19,460 --> 01:47:19,779
Easy.

692
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:21,479
Easy.

693
01:47:21,479 --> 01:47:35,479
What's your problem?

694
01:47:35,479 --> 01:47:36,119
Stop.

695
01:47:36,119 --> 01:47:52,140
What's your...

696
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:53,180
There we go.

697
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:54,060
That's it, huh?

698
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:55,050
Okay.

699
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:55,850
Let's get it in the computer.

700
01:48:05,109 --> 01:48:06,390
Brash on the head.

701
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:10,550
That's it.

702
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:12,069
All right.

703
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:22,659
How come your face is a different color than your body?

704
01:48:25,609 --> 01:48:27,130
A combination of bad lighting,

705
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:30,069
a bunch of blood in my face,

706
01:48:30,069 --> 01:48:35,500
and I don't know.

707
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:37,189
Weird lighting.

708
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:38,630
And the white balance is fucked up.

709
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:46,310
I'm playing a scary game.

710
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:46,949
What are you talking about?

711
01:48:46,949 --> 01:48:47,909
It's intense.

712
01:48:47,909 --> 01:48:52,100
My face is full of blood and fluids.

713
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:52,340
All right.

714
01:48:52,340 --> 01:49:07,140
Let's start it.

715
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:08,739
There we go.

716
01:49:08,739 --> 01:49:09,619
Eyecaps.

717
01:49:09,619 --> 01:49:21,380
All right.

718
01:49:22,659 --> 01:49:25,220
Now we do this stuff in the neck.

719
01:49:25,220 --> 01:49:42,760
Okay.

720
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:44,039
And the last one is right here.

721
01:49:45,479 --> 01:49:46,680
What the fuck was that?

722
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:05,909
I'm gonna be able to get out of here.

723
01:50:05,909 --> 01:50:11,270
No, nothing.

724
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:11,590
Okay.

725
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:11,989
Keep going.

726
01:50:11,989 --> 01:50:13,779
Keep going.

727
01:50:13,779 --> 01:50:15,460
I really do think it's the first guy, though.

728
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:20,180
I need tubing.

729
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,140
Oh, shit.

730
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:22,779
Oh, my goodness.

731
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:23,180
Okay.

732
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:24,460
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

733
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:25,260
Stop, stop, stop.

734
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:29,899
That's different now.

735
01:50:29,899 --> 01:50:30,619
That's a circle.

736
01:50:30,619 --> 01:50:33,529
Oh, oh, oh.

737
01:50:33,529 --> 01:50:37,800
Can't hold anything up.

738
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:39,399
Oh, please.

739
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:47,140
Take the tube.

740
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:56,600
Okay.

741
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:59,689
I can't make an incision.

742
01:50:59,689 --> 01:51:00,170
I need this.

743
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:01,210
Oh, I need a scalpel.

744
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:09,289
Scalpel.

745
01:51:09,289 --> 01:51:09,930
Let's go.

746
01:51:09,930 --> 01:51:12,359
I can't use that here.

747
01:51:12,359 --> 01:51:16,020
What's going on?

748
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:17,140
Did I not put this in?

749
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:18,100
I can't hold anything else.

750
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:19,539
I didn't put the menthol in?

751
01:51:19,539 --> 01:51:25,130
God damn it.

752
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:25,609
Okay.

753
01:51:25,609 --> 01:51:30,260
I'm missing something.

754
01:51:30,979 --> 01:51:37,399
All right.

755
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:37,800
Let's go.

756
01:51:39,050 --> 01:51:40,090
I can't use that here.

757
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:42,869
Begin.

758
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:23,750
That felt weird when I walked in the room.

759
01:52:24,710 --> 01:52:27,060
Do you know what I mean?

760
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,300
Like something about I felt weird.

761
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:31,859
I felt off walking in here.

762
01:52:31,859 --> 01:52:33,399
I don't know why I just did.

763
01:52:33,399 --> 01:52:34,039
I told you.

764
01:52:34,039 --> 01:52:35,079
What did I fucking told you?

765
01:52:35,079 --> 01:52:36,119
Something was weird.

766
01:52:36,119 --> 01:52:36,840
I told you so.

767
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,520
I got bad vibes when I opened the door.

768
01:52:39,159 --> 01:52:40,250
I could feel it.

769
01:52:46,569 --> 01:52:47,130
Jesus.

770
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:49,109
Okay.

771
01:52:50,010 --> 01:53:01,109
Um, now we've got to do the wait.

772
01:53:01,109 --> 01:53:10,310
Let me check this.

773
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:10,869
All right.

774
01:53:10,869 --> 01:53:14,220
We got to, um, okay.

775
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:15,899
The abdominal cavity and clean the bathroom.

776
01:53:42,359 --> 01:53:43,000
Write it down.

777
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:43,560
Write it down.

778
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:46,119
If you could.

779
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:47,239
Holy shit.

780
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:12,789
44.

781
01:54:12,789 --> 01:54:14,149
Estimated 44.

782
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:28,520
If S 44, S 44, S 40, S 44.

783
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:31,510
I can't hold anything else.

784
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:38,779
I can't use that here.

785
01:54:38,779 --> 01:54:39,340
Why not?

786
01:54:39,340 --> 01:55:02,069
I can't hold anything else.

787
01:55:02,069 --> 01:55:03,430
Oh, goodness.

788
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:19,100
Where is it?

789
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:19,899
Where is it?

790
01:55:22,489 --> 01:55:23,529
Excuse me.

791
01:55:23,529 --> 01:55:23,850
Where?

792
01:55:24,569 --> 01:55:29,189
That's who it is.

793
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:29,739
All right.

794
01:55:29,739 --> 01:55:30,300
I know it.

795
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:32,550
Let's get it on there.

796
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:38,420
Should that it's down and then bird Z down three.

797
01:55:46,699 --> 01:55:47,500
Like that, right?

798
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,539
I can't hold anything else.

799
01:55:49,539 --> 01:55:52,010
Okay.

800
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:52,890
I want to put it on you.

801
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:53,770
What do you do?

802
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:57,979
I'm going to drop this shit.

803
01:55:57,979 --> 01:56:07,159
I'm missing something.

804
01:56:07,159 --> 01:56:08,279
What are you talking about?

805
01:56:08,279 --> 01:56:10,199
Give me the.

806
01:56:11,079 --> 01:56:12,600
I already, I already have one of those.

807
01:56:13,529 --> 01:56:13,770
What?

808
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:16,090
Oh my God.

809
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:17,130
Fuck that guy.

810
01:56:17,770 --> 01:56:19,770
That was fucking horrible.

811
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:20,890
Holy shit.

812
01:56:22,539 --> 01:56:23,579
Oh my God.

813
01:56:23,579 --> 01:56:25,020
That was awful.

814
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:27,770
It was awful.

815
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:28,250
Write it down.

816
01:56:32,489 --> 01:56:33,289
Jesus.

817
01:56:47,739 --> 01:56:48,380
Okay.

818
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:51,220
I know who it is, but I don't think it's her.

819
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:52,100
I think it's the guy.

820
01:56:58,090 --> 01:57:02,600
There we go.

821
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:03,689
Okay.

822
01:57:03,689 --> 01:57:04,890
Cleaner from the bathroom.

823
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:05,289
I got to.

824
01:57:05,289 --> 01:57:06,170
Are you serious?

825
01:57:06,170 --> 01:57:07,960
Can I just pour it in?

826
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:08,439
Who cares?

827
01:57:14,489 --> 01:57:17,100
It's it's should that it's should that.

828
01:57:17,659 --> 01:57:18,060
Okay.

829
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:19,800
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

830
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,640
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

831
01:57:26,579 --> 01:57:26,979
Okay.

832
01:57:26,979 --> 01:57:27,380
All right.

833
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:27,699
All right.

834
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:28,020
All right.

835
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:28,579
Give me the thing.

836
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:32,840
If I put this on you, what do you do?

837
01:57:38,789 --> 01:57:41,109
Are you sure this is the right?

838
01:57:41,109 --> 01:57:43,130
Yep.

839
01:57:43,130 --> 01:57:44,489
Oh, yes, I am.

840
01:57:44,489 --> 01:57:54,890
I'm missing something.

841
01:57:54,890 --> 01:58:12,310
I actually don't know.

842
01:58:12,310 --> 01:58:12,710
Okay.

843
01:58:12,710 --> 01:58:13,029
All right.

844
01:58:13,029 --> 01:58:13,670
Moisture.

845
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:14,710
I've got places to be.

846
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:15,270
Let's go.

847
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:16,859
Hurry up.

848
01:58:16,859 --> 01:58:19,239
Moisturize.

849
01:58:19,239 --> 01:58:26,810
All right.

850
01:58:26,810 --> 01:58:27,210
Let's go.

851
01:58:27,689 --> 01:58:35,270
I think it's the first guy.

852
01:58:40,869 --> 01:58:41,270
You know what?

853
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:43,510
I'm going to take the third person out and put this on them.

854
01:58:43,510 --> 01:59:07,779
Hey, it's you.

855
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:09,189
I think.

856
01:59:09,189 --> 01:59:10,069
Get over here.

857
01:59:10,069 --> 01:59:13,899
You know what?

858
01:59:13,899 --> 01:59:15,020
Just stay right here for a second.

859
01:59:15,579 --> 01:59:52,779
I can't use that here.

860
02:00:32,409 --> 02:00:54,680
He's got scratches.

861
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,699
Move him.

862
02:00:56,699 --> 02:00:57,260
There we go.

863
02:00:57,899 --> 02:01:06,069
Stop.

864
02:01:06,069 --> 02:01:06,869
I want to go back.

865
02:01:18,119 --> 02:01:18,840
No.

866
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:19,319
Left leg.

867
02:01:20,819 --> 02:01:21,779
Left arm.

868
02:01:21,779 --> 02:01:22,659
That's it.

869
02:01:23,539 --> 02:01:30,539
Where's my thing?

870
02:01:30,539 --> 02:01:31,260
Where's my thing that I?

871
02:01:31,260 --> 02:01:31,420
Okay.

872
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:32,460
It's on it right here.

873
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:34,090
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

874
02:01:34,090 --> 02:01:35,529
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

875
02:01:35,529 --> 02:01:36,329
I can't hold any.

876
02:01:36,329 --> 02:01:37,689
I can't hold anything else.

877
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:39,289
Stupid thing back then.

878
02:01:39,289 --> 02:01:48,520
Everyone's saying, hey, calm down, calm down.

879
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:51,239
I mean, I don't have to go fast because I'm going to get possessed

880
02:01:51,239 --> 02:01:53,319
and I'm losing my mind, right?

881
02:01:53,319 --> 02:02:32,180
The fuck?

882
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:33,060
There we go.

883
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:35,210
Okay.

884
02:02:35,829 --> 02:02:44,630
Eye caps.

885
02:02:44,630 --> 02:02:45,430
All right.

886
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:47,159
Mix the fluid.

887
02:02:53,180 --> 02:02:53,739
Don't.

888
02:02:53,739 --> 02:02:56,060
I know there's something probably going to be in here in a second.

889
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:56,460
Come on.

890
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,000
You know, close this door.

891
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:01,560
Close the door.

892
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:02,600
I don't want anyone to see me in here.

893
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:03,159
Close this door.

894
02:03:03,159 --> 02:03:03,880
Thank you.

895
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:07,960
All right.

896
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:14,539
Let's fill it up.

897
02:03:14,539 --> 02:03:14,939
Okay.

898
02:03:14,939 --> 02:03:17,340
Now it's the incision with scalpel forceps.

899
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:17,840
Joy.

900
02:03:19,979 --> 02:03:24,310
And then I need the tube.

901
02:03:24,310 --> 02:04:05,079
What is that?

902
02:04:05,079 --> 02:04:05,720
Oh, shit.

903
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:06,039
It's going to.

904
02:04:06,039 --> 02:04:07,159
Does that say going to say 44?

905
02:04:35,109 --> 02:04:35,670
Say something.

906
02:04:35,670 --> 02:04:36,630
I'm missing something.

907
02:04:39,829 --> 02:04:40,630
Shit.

908
02:04:40,630 --> 02:04:42,460
23.

909
02:04:44,869 --> 02:04:48,170
Does he have new scratches?

910
02:04:48,170 --> 02:04:48,670
Does he?

911
02:04:55,079 --> 02:05:06,680
Where?

912
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:08,359
It's the first guy.

913
02:05:08,359 --> 02:05:09,159
It's the first guy.

914
02:05:09,159 --> 02:05:09,479
Yeah.

915
02:05:09,479 --> 02:05:09,800
Fuck it.

916
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:10,439
I'm not spinning.

917
02:05:10,439 --> 02:05:11,079
I'm not waiting.

918
02:05:11,079 --> 02:05:11,720
It's the first guy.

919
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:12,600
It's the first guy.

920
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:14,619
Without a doubt.

921
02:05:14,619 --> 02:05:15,899
Without a doubt in my mind.

922
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:16,859
I'm missing something.

923
02:05:16,859 --> 02:05:17,500
It's the guy out here.

924
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:18,300
It's the first guy.

925
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:22,819
Get him off this thing.

926
02:05:23,539 --> 02:05:26,859
I think I have to finish it.

927
02:05:26,859 --> 02:05:27,739
Yeah, I do, don't I?

928
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:28,699
I can't.

929
02:05:28,699 --> 02:05:32,390
I can't hold anything else.

930
02:05:52,180 --> 02:05:54,020
Don't you love your grandma?

931
02:05:54,020 --> 02:06:01,939
It's so cold out here.

932
02:06:02,819 --> 02:06:04,020
Leave me the fuck alone.

933
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:31,189
Get the fuck out of here, you bitch.

934
02:06:31,189 --> 02:06:32,069
Grandma.

935
02:06:32,069 --> 02:06:32,789
My goodness.

936
02:06:34,970 --> 02:06:36,170
Watch your language.

937
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:40,420
All right.

938
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:41,539
Finish it, please.

939
02:06:41,539 --> 02:06:42,659
Before I get in.

940
02:06:42,659 --> 02:06:42,979
Okay.

941
02:06:42,979 --> 02:06:43,300
Hold on.

942
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:43,939
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

943
02:06:43,939 --> 02:06:44,899
I'm missing something.

944
02:06:44,899 --> 02:06:46,100
I got to finish this.

945
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:46,899
That's the first guy.

946
02:06:46,899 --> 02:06:51,020
I'm missing something.

947
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:51,739
Give me the bag.

948
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:53,260
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

949
02:06:53,260 --> 02:06:53,659
Where is it?

950
02:06:53,659 --> 02:06:53,979
Right here.

951
02:07:18,619 --> 02:07:19,180
Let me in.

952
02:07:19,979 --> 02:07:24,789
There we go.

953
02:07:24,789 --> 02:07:25,029
All right.

954
02:07:25,029 --> 02:07:25,670
You're done.

955
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:26,149
You're done.

956
02:07:26,149 --> 02:07:26,630
You're done.

957
02:07:26,630 --> 02:07:27,189
You're done.

958
02:07:27,189 --> 02:07:28,229
Clean the bathroom.

959
02:07:28,229 --> 02:07:37,750
There's no more cleaner.

960
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:42,949
There's no more cleaner.

961
02:07:42,949 --> 02:07:43,750
What do I do?

962
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:53,800
I dropped it somewhere.

963
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:54,680
Oh, fuck.

964
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:55,159
Come on.

965
02:07:55,159 --> 02:07:56,119
Don't do this to me now.

966
02:07:56,119 --> 02:07:56,840
Where is it?

967
02:07:56,840 --> 02:08:04,939
Where did I drop it?

968
02:08:04,939 --> 02:08:09,239
There are more than one shelf.

969
02:08:09,239 --> 02:08:49,880
Why is it quiet?

970
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:50,199
What?

971
02:09:11,289 --> 02:09:11,789
Hey.

972
02:09:19,989 --> 02:09:20,949
I'm not.

973
02:09:20,949 --> 02:09:23,770
I'm still kind of alive here.

974
02:09:23,770 --> 02:09:25,720
All right.

975
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:26,199
What did I do?

976
02:09:26,199 --> 02:09:27,000
It was heroin, right?

977
02:09:27,000 --> 02:10:13,449
What the fuck do I do?

978
02:10:13,449 --> 02:10:24,010
No, don't look at that.

979
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:25,050
Get tubing by.

980
02:10:26,170 --> 02:10:27,960
I'm sorry, guys.

981
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:29,159
I just have so locked in.

982
02:10:29,159 --> 02:10:29,479
All right.

983
02:10:29,479 --> 02:10:32,630
Get tubing, needle, and lighter.

984
02:10:32,630 --> 02:10:33,829
Tubing by the bed.

985
02:10:33,829 --> 02:10:39,479
Tubing, needle, and lighter.

986
02:10:39,479 --> 02:10:41,369
Tubing.

987
02:10:41,369 --> 02:10:46,090
Where's the needle?

988
02:10:46,090 --> 02:10:48,819
Needle, bathroom, spoon from the coffee table.

989
02:10:48,819 --> 02:10:54,649
That's not it.

990
02:10:54,649 --> 02:10:58,060
That's the spoon, right?

991
02:10:58,060 --> 02:11:08,840
I don't get it.

992
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:09,960
Needle from the bathroom.

993
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:18,649
I can't see a needle.

994
02:11:18,649 --> 02:11:24,149
Needle.

995
02:11:24,149 --> 02:11:24,789
Where?

996
02:11:24,789 --> 02:11:29,909
Find a lighter.

997
02:11:29,909 --> 02:11:31,720
Find a full baggie.

998
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:42,680
Encounter.

999
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:43,319
Lighter.

1000
02:11:43,319 --> 02:11:45,800
Spoon from the coffee table.

1001
02:11:46,699 --> 02:11:48,810
Dude, the spoon is right there.

1002
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:49,689
I can't click it.

1003
02:11:49,689 --> 02:11:59,720
That's the spoon right here.

1004
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:00,600
In order?

1005
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:02,600
Why does it be in order?

1006
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:05,720
Find a lighter.

1007
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:20,310
You see a lighter?

1008
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:21,029
Lighter.

1009
02:12:21,029 --> 02:12:26,359
You looked in the same two spots.

1010
02:12:26,359 --> 02:12:26,840
I mean, look.

1011
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:28,359
It's dark as shit in here.

1012
02:12:28,359 --> 02:12:29,960
I can't see anything.

1013
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:31,029
What are you talking?

1014
02:12:31,029 --> 02:12:32,789
I can't see a goddamn thing.

1015
02:12:32,789 --> 02:12:41,560
It's right there.

1016
02:12:41,560 --> 02:13:10,579
It's dark.

1017
02:13:10,579 --> 02:13:24,039
What the fuck?

1018
02:13:24,039 --> 02:13:24,840
Close the door.

1019
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:26,039
Close the door.

1020
02:13:26,039 --> 02:13:29,270
Sound like a laugh track?

1021
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:30,630
No, it didn't, dude.

1022
02:13:30,630 --> 02:13:39,770
That does not sound like a laugh track.

1023
02:13:39,770 --> 02:13:44,630
All right.

1024
02:13:44,630 --> 02:13:49,210
I got to get this motherfucker out of here.

1025
02:13:49,210 --> 02:13:49,930
Moisturizer.

1026
02:13:49,930 --> 02:13:51,369
And then it's the first guy.

1027
02:13:51,369 --> 02:13:57,399
It's the first one.

1028
02:13:57,399 --> 02:13:59,050
Oh, goodness.

1029
02:13:59,050 --> 02:14:01,380
It's here.

1030
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:01,859
It's here.

1031
02:14:01,859 --> 02:14:02,579
It's here.

1032
02:14:02,579 --> 02:14:03,560
It's here.

1033
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:03,800
Wait.

1034
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,479
There are new scratches on this person.

1035
02:14:05,479 --> 02:14:07,750
Scratches, scratches, scratches.

1036
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:07,989
Right there.

1037
02:14:07,989 --> 02:14:10,970
Were they there before?

1038
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:11,930
I don't think they were.

1039
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:17,460
All right.

1040
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:18,739
Let's moisturize their face.

1041
02:14:18,739 --> 02:14:22,380
All right.

1042
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:23,100
OK.

1043
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:26,630
Which one of you idiots is it?

1044
02:14:26,630 --> 02:14:29,800
It's the first one.

1045
02:14:38,729 --> 02:14:39,609
Yeah, no doubt.

1046
02:14:39,609 --> 02:14:40,329
It's the first one.

1047
02:14:40,329 --> 02:14:41,289
It's the first one.

1048
02:14:41,289 --> 02:14:42,250
You know, you can just stay here.

1049
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:42,810
I don't even care.

1050
02:14:42,810 --> 02:14:43,609
Wait, I need the gurney.

1051
02:14:43,609 --> 02:15:23,829
Are you sure this is the first one?

1052
02:15:24,069 --> 02:15:25,590
Shit, it was this guy.

1053
02:15:25,590 --> 02:15:27,590
I was like trying to clean up the place.

1054
02:15:27,590 --> 02:15:29,029
I was trying to clean it up.

1055
02:15:29,029 --> 02:15:40,279
How is this guy out?

1056
02:15:40,279 --> 02:15:41,319
This is weird.

1057
02:15:41,319 --> 02:15:41,880
It's this guy.

1058
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:43,079
Look at how fucking weird that is.

1059
02:16:29,829 --> 02:16:30,149
Yes.

1060
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:42,739
Gotcha.

1061
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:51,899
Gotcha.

1062
02:16:51,899 --> 02:17:09,139
Is it the same ending?

1063
02:17:09,139 --> 02:17:10,659
Same ending.

1064
02:17:10,659 --> 02:17:12,659
So how do I get it to be a different ending?

1065
02:17:12,659 --> 02:17:13,379
Come a long way.

1066
02:17:13,379 --> 02:17:17,219
It's nice not to be the...

1067
02:17:17,219 --> 02:17:17,860
No, this is different.

1068
02:17:18,709 --> 02:17:20,780
Mr. Dover?

1069
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:21,340
Oh, no.

1070
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:24,540
I think you can just call me Raymond at this point.

1071
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:27,420
Do you always just pass out and wake up on the floor?

1072
02:17:29,139 --> 02:17:30,899
It takes a lot out of you.

1073
02:17:30,899 --> 02:17:35,370
I've never simply walked out of here after.

1074
02:17:35,370 --> 02:17:36,250
You get used to it.

1075
02:17:38,139 --> 02:17:39,899
I'll be sure to clean the floors better.

1076
02:17:41,799 --> 02:17:44,280
Raymond, will this ever end?

1077
02:17:46,219 --> 02:17:47,340
I honestly don't know.

1078
02:17:47,979 --> 02:17:51,049
I've been doing this a long time, Rebecca.

1079
02:17:51,049 --> 02:17:54,889
I've traveled all over, learning everything I can.

1080
02:17:56,729 --> 02:17:59,290
I've never found anything that could put a stop to it.

1081
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:00,729
You've got to iron that shirt, bro.

1082
02:18:00,729 --> 02:18:03,209
So no, I don't think it does.

1083
02:18:04,010 --> 02:18:06,969
So we're just like this forever?

1084
02:18:07,909 --> 02:18:09,030
It was hard for me, too.

1085
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:11,700
But this is the life we get.

1086
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:16,309
We have to face our worst selves constantly.

1087
02:18:17,750 --> 02:18:19,829
Stand around until you die in the next one?

1088
02:18:19,829 --> 02:18:20,389
Let's try that.

1089
02:18:20,389 --> 02:18:21,030
We are.

1090
02:18:21,030 --> 02:18:25,879
Why don't you head home?

1091
02:18:25,879 --> 02:18:26,760
Get some rest.

1092
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:28,200
Just die?

1093
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:29,559
Who knows what's coming tonight?

1094
02:18:29,559 --> 02:18:37,770
Do another one and burn the first guy?

1095
02:18:37,770 --> 02:18:38,090
I already...

1096
02:18:38,090 --> 02:18:41,370
I did that already.

1097
02:18:41,370 --> 02:18:45,909
No, that's a different ending.

1098
02:18:45,909 --> 02:18:46,549
I burnt the...

1099
02:18:47,190 --> 02:18:54,010
Remember, I just picked somebody up and burnt them?

1100
02:18:54,010 --> 02:18:55,670
So how do I get...

1101
02:18:55,670 --> 02:18:56,790
You're just saying just don't do anything.

1102
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:57,590
Just stand still.

1103
02:18:57,590 --> 02:19:13,110
Just let this sigil form and get possessed.

1104
02:19:13,110 --> 02:19:14,389
I'll do a possessed ending.

1105
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:17,750
Death and decay.

1106
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:25,959
Don't leave the apartment.

1107
02:19:51,479 --> 02:19:52,360
Embalm.

1108
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:57,190
Look about the history of preservation.

1109
02:19:57,190 --> 02:19:57,989
Oh, shit.

1110
02:19:57,989 --> 02:19:59,719
It's grandma.

1111
02:19:59,719 --> 02:20:27,379
Nothing in there.

1112
02:20:27,379 --> 02:20:27,700
Nothing.

1113
02:20:35,670 --> 02:20:41,290
Check under the TV.

1114
02:20:45,799 --> 02:20:46,600
Under the TV?

1115
02:20:56,059 --> 02:20:56,620
Try to cook.

1116
02:20:57,510 --> 02:20:57,989
I don't have any...

1117
02:20:57,989 --> 02:20:59,030
Do I have any food?

1118
02:20:59,030 --> 02:21:17,420
Do heroin.

1119
02:21:17,420 --> 02:21:17,979
No.

1120
02:21:17,979 --> 02:21:43,819
Nothing in here.

1121
02:21:43,819 --> 02:21:44,299
Oh, no.

1122
02:21:44,299 --> 02:21:49,860
I just yawed.

1123
02:21:49,860 --> 02:21:50,579
Oh, what's this?

1124
02:21:51,299 --> 02:21:52,260
My dad's necklace.

1125
02:21:52,899 --> 02:21:55,379
Love you, dad.

1126
02:21:55,379 --> 02:21:56,579
My sobriety coin?

1127
02:21:59,319 --> 02:22:01,319
My dad's sobriety coin.

1128
02:22:01,319 --> 02:22:04,540
Okay.

1129
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:06,219
So I have these items?

1130
02:22:06,219 --> 02:22:10,360
Okay.

1131
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:15,350
Should I go now?

1132
02:22:15,350 --> 02:22:32,729
Where are my keys?

1133
02:22:32,729 --> 02:22:33,209
All right.

1134
02:22:33,209 --> 02:22:35,180
It's getting kind of late.

1135
02:22:38,260 --> 02:22:39,180
What do you think?

1136
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:39,579
One more...

1137
02:22:40,139 --> 02:22:41,260
Just try to lose.

1138
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:42,739
Just get scared.

1139
02:22:42,739 --> 02:22:53,079
All right.

1140
02:22:53,079 --> 02:22:56,700
Let's just do everything wrong.

1141
02:22:56,700 --> 02:23:04,700
Get the body out but do the name wrong.

1142
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:05,340
All right.

1143
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:06,620
Timothy Sharp.

1144
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:14,090
Just do everything wrong.

1145
02:23:14,090 --> 02:23:14,729
Okay.

1146
02:23:14,729 --> 02:23:36,680
Am I doing that or is he doing that?

1147
02:23:41,540 --> 02:23:42,500
Get the secret ending?

1148
02:23:43,059 --> 02:24:13,579
Do everything right with the coins

1149
02:24:13,579 --> 02:24:14,459
and get the secret ending.

1150
02:24:16,979 --> 02:24:23,239
Wait, this is my work badge.

1151
02:24:23,239 --> 02:24:29,579
Wait, what?

1152
02:24:29,579 --> 02:24:32,299
Oh, I'm like an actual employee now.

1153
02:24:32,299 --> 02:24:38,889
I don't need a password anymore.

1154
02:24:38,889 --> 02:24:59,479
Oh, no.

1155
02:24:59,479 --> 02:25:00,920
Why am I so tired?

1156
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:01,799
Scare me.

1157
02:25:01,799 --> 02:25:03,860
Scream at me or something.

1158
02:25:03,860 --> 02:25:17,079
This dude thought he could handle

1159
02:25:17,079 --> 02:25:18,120
the McDonald's order.

1160
02:25:32,120 --> 02:25:32,920
That's it.

1161
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:43,420
All right.

1162
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:44,219
Left leg.

1163
02:25:44,219 --> 02:25:44,780
Yep.

1164
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:45,899
Right shoulder.

1165
02:25:45,899 --> 02:25:46,620
Yep.

1166
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:47,340
Left shoulder.

1167
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:47,659
Yep.

1168
02:25:47,659 --> 02:25:49,159
Left arm.

1169
02:25:49,159 --> 02:25:50,120
Yep.

1170
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:50,760
Right arm.

1171
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:51,319
Nothing.

1172
02:25:51,319 --> 02:25:52,040
Right leg.

1173
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:53,819
Yep.

1174
02:25:53,819 --> 02:25:54,459
Right leg.

1175
02:25:54,459 --> 02:25:55,420
Left leg.

1176
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:55,899
Submit.

1177
02:26:10,549 --> 02:26:11,829
Oh, man.

1178
02:26:11,829 --> 02:26:12,629
That was bad.

1179
02:26:12,629 --> 02:26:13,430
I'm awake.

1180
02:26:13,430 --> 02:26:13,750
I'm awake.

1181
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:14,389
I woke up.

1182
02:26:14,389 --> 02:26:15,799
I woke up.

1183
02:26:15,799 --> 02:26:19,559
I'm good.

1184
02:26:19,559 --> 02:26:20,200
I'm awake.

1185
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:24,700
Come on.

1186
02:26:24,700 --> 02:26:26,260
Where's the light?

1187
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:38,200
All right.

1188
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:46,299
We need this stuff.

1189
02:26:46,299 --> 02:26:49,959
Eye caps.

1190
02:26:49,959 --> 02:26:50,920
Everything I need right now.

1191
02:26:56,329 --> 02:26:56,809
Yeah.

1192
02:26:56,809 --> 02:26:57,209
Yeah.

1193
02:26:57,209 --> 02:26:57,610
Yeah.

1194
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:58,010
Yep.

1195
02:26:58,010 --> 02:26:58,329
Yep.

1196
02:27:15,219 --> 02:27:16,020
Okay.

1197
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:16,739
Fluid time.

1198
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:24,940
Fluid.

1199
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:26,540
It's time to make some delicious fluid.

1200
02:27:54,090 --> 02:27:55,530
I'm missing something.

1201
02:27:55,530 --> 02:27:56,729
Yes, I am.

1202
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:01,500
Tubes.

1203
02:28:01,500 --> 02:28:55,540
Clay tablet in the center is called a mark.

1204
02:28:56,920 --> 02:28:59,879
Placing the smaller pieces in the correct configuration

1205
02:28:59,879 --> 02:29:01,159
will spell the demon's name.

1206
02:29:02,889 --> 02:29:07,370
Second, the bottles on the top shelf are a special reagent

1207
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:08,649
that will react to the mark.

1208
02:29:08,649 --> 02:29:12,379
Add a bottle to the embalming mixture during the process.

1209
02:29:12,379 --> 02:29:14,979
When the mark is placed on the correct body,

1210
02:29:14,979 --> 02:29:18,420
the reagent inside it will force the demon to become

1211
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:20,389
bound to it.

1212
02:29:20,389 --> 02:29:22,549
Pay attention to signs that you have chosen

1213
02:29:22,549 --> 02:29:27,860
correct, obvious, or extremely subtle.

1214
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:30,819
Once you are certain that the demon is bound to its vessel,

1215
02:29:30,819 --> 02:29:39,750
describe the sigils of its name in our world

1216
02:29:39,750 --> 02:29:41,899
to begin the evocation.

1217
02:29:41,899 --> 02:29:44,379
You will need to uncover these sigils to use them.

1218
02:29:45,659 --> 02:29:48,219
Hold a letting strip up while wandering the mortuary.

1219
02:29:48,940 --> 02:29:51,659
If it begins to smolder and burn, your clothes...

1220
02:29:51,659 --> 02:29:52,780
Who the fuck are you?

1221
02:29:52,780 --> 02:29:54,860
...when the paper combusts, the sigil

1222
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:56,700
has been revealed somewhere in that area.

1223
02:29:58,739 --> 02:30:01,379
Can we turn off the Disney World line audio?

1224
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:02,739
Stop!

1225
02:30:33,030 --> 02:30:36,579
And remember, the most important rule.

1226
02:30:36,579 --> 02:30:48,059
Have fun on Splash Mountain.

1227
02:30:48,059 --> 02:30:50,620
1970, the year of arrival of the House of Death.

1228
02:30:51,979 --> 02:30:53,739
What the heck?

1229
02:31:08,860 --> 02:31:10,459
Come on, where is it?

1230
02:31:10,459 --> 02:31:22,069
I don't need this job.

1231
02:31:22,069 --> 02:31:22,709
See you later.

1232
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:26,500
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1233
02:31:26,500 --> 02:31:27,379
All right, that's about...

1234
02:31:28,180 --> 02:31:29,860
I'm going to call that a...

1235
02:31:30,579 --> 02:31:32,420
I don't know, a Hearthstone symbol.

1236
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:41,239
Did you move?

1237
02:31:41,239 --> 02:31:45,110
Oh, we need the bathroom cleaner.

1238
02:31:45,110 --> 02:32:05,030
And then we got to, um, moisturize.

1239
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:07,750
And then I don't know, I'm not getting anything from this guy.

1240
02:32:07,750 --> 02:32:11,379
I'm not getting anything from this guy.

1241
02:32:11,379 --> 02:32:11,940
I don't think it's him.

1242
02:32:12,579 --> 02:32:17,430
All right, we know it's this one, right?

1243
02:32:17,430 --> 02:32:18,149
Hearthstone symbol.

1244
02:32:18,709 --> 02:32:30,100
I'm missing something.

1245
02:32:31,930 --> 02:32:32,889
Don't do it right.

1246
02:32:36,700 --> 02:32:37,579
Put the wrong...

1247
02:32:37,579 --> 02:32:38,700
Oh, okay, right.

1248
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:43,180
Wrong symbol.

1249
02:32:43,180 --> 02:32:52,629
No, get it right.

1250
02:32:52,629 --> 02:32:54,229
Don't get it right.

1251
02:32:54,229 --> 02:32:55,190
Do not get it right.

1252
02:32:55,190 --> 02:32:57,159
Secret ending.

1253
02:32:57,159 --> 02:32:57,879
Do it right.

1254
02:32:57,879 --> 02:32:59,559
Well, I mean, I don't...

1255
02:32:59,559 --> 02:33:00,440
It's not this guy.

1256
02:33:00,440 --> 02:33:01,159
So that's...

1257
02:33:01,159 --> 02:33:03,829
I know that pretty much for a fact.

1258
02:33:03,829 --> 02:33:04,549
It's not this guy.

1259
02:33:18,389 --> 02:33:25,750
Who's there?

1260
02:33:25,750 --> 02:33:27,399
Yeah, let's do a poll.

1261
02:33:27,399 --> 02:33:28,200
All right, run a poll.

1262
02:33:28,200 --> 02:33:31,000
Do you want me to get it right?

1263
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:51,100
Or do you want me to get it wrong on purpose and get a different ending?

1264
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:52,700
I need to get it twisted.

1265
02:34:04,649 --> 02:34:11,129
Okay.

1266
02:34:11,129 --> 02:34:39,799
Are you moving?

1267
02:34:39,799 --> 02:34:40,760
I'll get it.

1268
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:45,430
Hello?

1269
02:34:45,430 --> 02:34:45,930
Hello?

1270
02:34:46,709 --> 02:34:57,909
It's you.

1271
02:34:57,909 --> 02:34:59,190
Leave all the windows open?

1272
02:34:59,190 --> 02:35:14,200
No, the bugs will get in.

1273
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:20,920
I don't want to do that.

1274
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:47,510
Wait.

1275
02:35:47,510 --> 02:35:48,229
There we go.

1276
02:35:48,229 --> 02:35:50,950
Okay, those are some scrapes.

1277
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:53,819
Those are scrapes.

1278
02:35:53,819 --> 02:35:54,620
Do it right.

1279
02:35:54,620 --> 02:35:59,239
Okay.

1280
02:35:59,239 --> 02:36:00,520
This scrapes all over.

1281
02:36:00,520 --> 02:36:17,370
Rebecca?

1282
02:36:17,370 --> 02:36:28,139
Oh, damn it.

1283
02:36:28,139 --> 02:36:40,780
Rebecca, come here.

1284
02:37:02,790 --> 02:37:18,090
Mom, you stupid bitch.

1285
02:37:19,620 --> 02:37:22,229
Hate me all you want.

1286
02:37:22,229 --> 02:37:25,579
He's dead because of you.

1287
02:37:25,579 --> 02:37:26,860
You should be the one here.

1288
02:37:34,629 --> 02:37:35,190
All right, leave.

1289
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:45,780
Give it to me.

1290
02:37:45,780 --> 02:37:46,659
You bitch.

1291
02:37:46,659 --> 02:37:47,379
Give it to me.

1292
02:37:47,379 --> 02:37:48,420
Let me in.

1293
02:37:48,420 --> 02:37:53,559
I love that voice.

1294
02:37:53,559 --> 02:37:54,920
Let me in.

1295
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:56,120
Let me in your house.

1296
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:56,680
Let me in.

1297
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:57,559
Let me in your house.

1298
02:38:00,299 --> 02:38:03,129
I can't move.

1299
02:38:03,129 --> 02:38:12,899
Okay.

1300
02:38:12,899 --> 02:38:13,379
All right.

1301
02:38:13,379 --> 02:38:16,329
So, where were we?

1302
02:38:16,329 --> 02:38:17,290
Oh, right.

1303
02:38:17,290 --> 02:38:23,209
Did I not print it?

1304
02:38:23,209 --> 02:38:27,020
Wait.

1305
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:27,579
No, I didn't.

1306
02:38:27,579 --> 02:38:28,219
Okay, I did.

1307
02:38:28,219 --> 02:38:40,899
Let me in your house.

1308
02:38:40,899 --> 02:38:43,860
All right, now we got to do this shit.

1309
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:46,500
I already have one of those.

1310
02:38:46,500 --> 02:38:59,780
Okay, well, let's do it then.

1311
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:04,010
There we go.

1312
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:04,969
I'm missing something.

1313
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:13,159
Okay.

1314
02:39:13,799 --> 02:39:17,450
All right.

1315
02:39:18,780 --> 02:39:19,819
Now, let's begin this.

1316
02:39:22,579 --> 02:39:23,299
We need the fluid.

1317
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:48,280
I just made a warhead.

1318
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:49,239
It was so sour.

1319
02:39:51,909 --> 02:39:54,389
Why the fuck did we fill this shit?

1320
02:39:54,389 --> 02:39:56,790
Why did we put this in people?

1321
02:39:56,790 --> 02:39:58,389
Who was the first person that was like,

1322
02:39:58,389 --> 02:39:59,110
oh, you know what?

1323
02:39:59,110 --> 02:40:00,409
I have an idea.

1324
02:40:00,409 --> 02:40:02,409
Let's pump this person full of formaldehyde.

1325
02:40:04,459 --> 02:40:05,579
Why would somebody?

1326
02:40:05,579 --> 02:40:06,299
What for what?

1327
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:08,540
Who decided to do that?

1328
02:40:08,540 --> 02:40:11,780
Oh, shit.

1329
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:12,659
Hold on.

1330
02:40:24,579 --> 02:40:25,540
Yeah, where is it?

1331
02:40:32,860 --> 02:40:35,690
Pi.

1332
02:40:35,690 --> 02:40:36,969
All right, we got Pi.

1333
02:40:39,770 --> 02:40:45,719
Okay, who could it be?

1334
02:40:45,719 --> 02:40:46,760
What's my code?

1335
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:47,559
Do I have a code?

1336
02:40:48,700 --> 02:40:49,819
I don't have a code, do I?

1337
02:40:57,530 --> 02:40:58,889
I'm so confused, didn't I?

1338
02:40:58,889 --> 02:41:01,379
This was my ID in here before.

1339
02:41:01,379 --> 02:41:14,219
Two, four, six, three, three.

1340
02:41:14,219 --> 02:41:18,010
Okay, Pi and Hearthstone.

1341
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,139
No.

1342
02:41:23,139 --> 02:41:28,649
Okay, it could be Telduck.

1343
02:41:28,649 --> 02:41:35,860
Telduck?

1344
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:46,489
No, it's probably Telduck.

1345
02:41:46,489 --> 02:41:47,780
Telduck.

1346
02:41:47,780 --> 02:41:48,819
All right, what's Telduck?

1347
02:41:52,329 --> 02:41:59,239
Pi, Hearthstone, Bong, and J.

1348
02:41:59,239 --> 02:42:01,139
So we need to find...

1349
02:42:01,139 --> 02:42:02,180
So it's Bong and J.

1350
02:42:02,180 --> 02:42:03,219
So that's definitely it.

1351
02:42:07,770 --> 02:42:12,329
Bong is at the top, right?

1352
02:42:12,329 --> 02:42:15,370
Bong, Hearthstone, Pi, J.

1353
02:42:15,370 --> 02:42:25,819
Okay.

1354
02:42:25,819 --> 02:42:26,940
I can't hold anything else.

1355
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:27,659
So that's done.

1356
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:34,540
Right, incision.

1357
02:42:34,540 --> 02:42:35,899
Don't scare me, idiot.

1358
02:42:35,899 --> 02:42:38,969
I need a scalpel.

1359
02:42:38,969 --> 02:42:50,360
I already have one of those.

1360
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:51,319
Oh, I forgot to put...

1361
02:42:51,319 --> 02:42:51,959
Okay.

1362
02:42:51,959 --> 02:42:54,340
I already have one of those.

1363
02:42:54,340 --> 02:42:55,299
What are you talking about?

1364
02:42:57,430 --> 02:42:57,930
Oh.

1365
02:43:05,350 --> 02:43:06,069
Tube.

1366
02:43:06,069 --> 02:43:15,899
Let's pump.

1367
02:43:51,370 --> 02:43:54,309
Where do I go from here?

1368
02:43:55,030 --> 02:44:01,020
Okay, turn it off.

1369
02:44:03,959 --> 02:44:04,920
Turn that off.

1370
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:07,079
Close it up.

1371
02:44:07,079 --> 02:44:12,620
What's wrong?

1372
02:44:16,729 --> 02:44:18,010
Something does feel weird.

1373
02:44:18,010 --> 02:44:24,649
I feel like I've been permanently changed.

1374
02:44:24,649 --> 02:44:26,250
Okay, let's go back here.

1375
02:44:32,819 --> 02:44:33,780
Don't even do it.

1376
02:44:34,579 --> 02:44:35,459
Don't do it.

1377
02:44:35,459 --> 02:44:41,500
Okay, the AC just turned on

1378
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:44,389
and I felt something touch my arm

1379
02:44:44,389 --> 02:44:59,270
and I almost puked.

1380
02:44:59,270 --> 02:44:59,770
There we go.

1381
02:45:00,709 --> 02:45:07,700
Okay, bathroom.

1382
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:18,840
Oh.

1383
02:45:21,139 --> 02:45:21,860
No, close those.

1384
02:45:21,860 --> 02:45:22,500
I don't want this open.

1385
02:45:51,139 --> 02:45:52,420
Oh, my God.

1386
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:53,059
That's a...

1387
02:45:53,059 --> 02:45:54,819
Has somebody shot me with a gun?

1388
02:45:54,819 --> 02:46:11,739
We're getting some really good tuber reactions.

1389
02:46:11,739 --> 02:46:13,180
Yeah, you really are today.

1390
02:46:13,180 --> 02:46:17,180
All right, I'm going to put this on...

1391
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:19,770
Let's see what happens here.

1392
02:46:19,770 --> 02:46:26,569
I don't think it's her either.

1393
02:46:26,569 --> 02:46:30,700
Are you sure this is the right...

1394
02:46:30,700 --> 02:46:32,620
No, I don't think it's you either.

1395
02:46:32,620 --> 02:46:50,520
I can't hold anything else.

1396
02:46:51,319 --> 02:46:52,549
Is it really...

1397
02:46:52,549 --> 02:46:53,909
This is a huge tuber stream?

1398
02:46:53,909 --> 02:46:54,629
Yeah, it is.

1399
02:46:54,629 --> 02:46:58,379
Dude, why is Holly behind you with a mask on?

1400
02:46:58,379 --> 02:47:02,139
Fucking terrifying.

1401
02:47:02,139 --> 02:47:02,639
Okay.

1402
02:47:02,639 --> 02:47:05,219
I'm missing something.

1403
02:47:05,219 --> 02:47:06,180
Oh, right.

1404
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:13,020
Oysterizer.

1405
02:47:13,020 --> 02:47:13,520
All right.

1406
02:47:23,579 --> 02:47:24,139
Hey, Josh.

1407
02:47:24,700 --> 02:47:26,889
What's that?

1408
02:47:26,889 --> 02:47:28,010
It's definitely you.

1409
02:47:56,790 --> 02:47:58,229
It's definitely this guy.

1410
02:47:58,229 --> 02:48:00,629
There's nothing weird happening with these ones.

1411
02:48:00,629 --> 02:48:07,180
Let's see if something weird happens with you.

1412
02:48:15,370 --> 02:48:15,850
Yeah.

1413
02:48:15,850 --> 02:48:16,569
I mean, come on.

1414
02:48:16,569 --> 02:48:16,969
Look at...

1415
02:48:26,700 --> 02:48:27,899
Do we even really need to do this

1416
02:48:27,899 --> 02:48:39,129
or should I just burn him?

1417
02:48:39,129 --> 02:48:41,530
It's definitely this guy.

1418
02:48:41,530 --> 02:48:42,170
We don't even...

1419
02:48:42,170 --> 02:48:43,370
I'm just going to burn him now.

1420
02:48:43,370 --> 02:48:56,649
Let's go, buddy.

1421
02:48:56,649 --> 02:49:02,840
How dare you smile?

1422
02:49:02,840 --> 02:49:03,159
No, no.

1423
02:49:03,159 --> 02:49:04,200
I want to take him out.

1424
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:09,110
I can't.

1425
02:49:09,110 --> 02:49:10,629
Oh, I can't move him now?

1426
02:49:10,629 --> 02:49:37,110
Oh, fine.

1427
02:49:37,110 --> 02:49:37,670
There we go.

1428
02:49:38,549 --> 02:49:44,790
So you're saying I'm holding these coins and shit, right?

1429
02:49:44,790 --> 02:49:47,190
Five-year coin, ten-year coin, necklace.

1430
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:51,290
You're saying that I can...

1431
02:49:51,290 --> 02:49:54,870
This is the secret end if I get this all.

1432
02:49:54,870 --> 02:50:09,799
If I do this.

1433
02:50:09,799 --> 02:50:10,760
You have to get it right, okay?

1434
02:50:22,040 --> 02:50:32,889
I have to use the items correctly.

1435
02:50:32,889 --> 02:50:38,059
There's going to be some stupid right here.

1436
02:50:46,549 --> 02:50:51,059
Missing something.

1437
02:50:51,059 --> 02:50:51,379
Look at...

1438
02:50:51,379 --> 02:50:52,020
He's like...

1439
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:53,379
His smile's even bigger now.

1440
02:50:53,379 --> 02:50:54,899
It's definitely this guy.

1441
02:50:54,899 --> 02:51:19,159
There's no doubt.

1442
02:51:19,159 --> 02:51:20,120
There we go.

1443
02:51:20,120 --> 02:51:25,280
All right.

1444
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:40,440
I can feel something coming.

1445
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:46,159
I knew it.

1446
02:51:46,159 --> 02:51:49,079
I'm not even checking.

1447
02:51:49,079 --> 02:51:49,399
It's just...

1448
02:51:49,399 --> 02:51:49,799
You're going to...

1449
02:51:49,799 --> 02:51:51,000
You're slamming the thing.

1450
02:51:51,559 --> 02:51:52,360
Doesn't matter.

1451
02:51:52,360 --> 02:52:10,030
This wasn't here before.

1452
02:52:24,319 --> 02:52:25,360
Oh, my God.

1453
02:52:33,979 --> 02:52:34,860
Come here, bitch.

1454
02:52:47,790 --> 02:52:48,829
Oh, that's bad.

1455
02:52:50,860 --> 02:53:23,129
Wait, four.

1456
02:53:23,129 --> 02:53:24,170
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1457
02:53:24,729 --> 02:53:27,120
Last lot, four.

1458
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:28,000
First, one.

1459
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:28,879
First lot, one.

1460
02:53:28,879 --> 02:53:29,920
Last lot, four.

1461
02:53:29,920 --> 02:53:33,799
Second, last lot, four.

1462
02:53:33,799 --> 02:53:35,159
One, something, something, something, four, four.

1463
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:39,079
One, four, four.

1464
02:53:40,719 --> 02:53:41,200
Four, four.

1465
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:42,959
One, and then something in four, four.

1466
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:48,280
I can't see this one.

1467
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:49,479
One, something, four, four, four.

1468
02:53:51,360 --> 02:53:53,120
One, something, seven, something, four, four.

1469
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:55,040
One, seven, something, four, four.

1470
02:53:57,819 --> 02:54:00,059
One, something, seven, zero, four, four.

1471
02:54:00,059 --> 02:54:01,420
One, something, seven, zero, four, four.

1472
02:54:02,989 --> 02:54:04,510
One, something, seven, zero, four, four.

1473
02:54:08,319 --> 02:54:11,579
One, one, nine, seven, zero, four, four.

1474
02:54:11,579 --> 02:54:14,760
Got it.

1475
02:54:14,760 --> 02:54:16,440
One, nine, seven, zero, four, four.

1476
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:21,879
What's the, I can, what's the, how do I,

1477
02:54:21,879 --> 02:54:22,680
what do I punch the code?

1478
02:54:22,680 --> 02:54:25,159
One, one, seven, one, nine, seven, zero, four.

1479
02:54:25,159 --> 02:54:25,879
How would I punch it in?

1480
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:30,040
What do I punch the code in?

1481
02:54:32,909 --> 02:54:34,190
One, nine, seven, zero, four, four.

1482
02:54:34,829 --> 02:54:40,719
Give me the fuck out of here.

1483
02:54:40,719 --> 02:54:50,350
Whose mouth did I not open?

1484
02:54:50,909 --> 02:55:08,379
Give me that key.

1485
02:55:08,379 --> 02:55:14,399
Bye.

1486
02:55:14,399 --> 02:55:15,200
Here, come here.

1487
02:55:39,899 --> 02:55:40,940
I'm gonna go left.

1488
02:55:40,940 --> 02:55:43,280
I make my own way.

1489
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:54,620
David Whitlow, December 8th, 1949.

1490
02:55:55,340 --> 02:56:01,440
Oh, somebody said Abraham Lincoln.

1491
02:56:10,299 --> 02:56:11,020
Um, what?

1492
02:56:33,479 --> 02:56:37,479
Jesus, what the hell was that?

1493
02:56:37,479 --> 02:56:53,600
How do I get in there?

1494
02:56:53,600 --> 02:57:14,750
All right, there was a keypad under a thing here, right?

1495
02:57:14,750 --> 02:57:19,450
I remember, where I was like, what is this for?

1496
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:24,680
It's like down here, right?

1497
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:26,510
Yep.

1498
02:57:26,510 --> 02:57:29,309
One, nine, seven, zero, four, four.

1499
02:57:29,309 --> 02:57:31,579
Key to the hatch.

1500
02:57:31,579 --> 02:57:32,680
Let's go.

1501
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:34,959
Oh God.

1502
02:58:13,049 --> 02:58:18,559
Just coming to get a refill, man.

1503
02:58:18,559 --> 02:58:27,389
I'm missing something.

1504
02:58:27,389 --> 02:58:41,319
Shit, it's too much.

1505
02:58:41,979 --> 02:58:50,090
Give me a TLDR.

1506
02:58:50,090 --> 02:58:51,450
Somebody just give me a TL...

1507
02:58:51,450 --> 02:58:53,049
Just somebody read it for me.

1508
02:58:53,049 --> 02:59:10,190
Okay.

1509
02:59:10,190 --> 02:59:34,559
The raging is the blood of the possessed.

1510
02:59:34,559 --> 02:59:36,649
What the fuck?

1511
02:59:36,649 --> 02:59:37,450
Thanks for the...

1512
02:59:37,450 --> 02:59:37,930
Yeah.

1513
02:59:37,930 --> 02:59:39,370
Spoilers, by the way.

1514
02:59:39,370 --> 02:59:43,819
Thanks, guys.

1515
02:59:43,819 --> 02:59:45,280
Oh, here we go.

1516
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:45,600
Good.

1517
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:46,239
I don't have to read it.

1518
02:59:46,239 --> 02:59:47,319
I'm missing something.

1519
02:59:47,319 --> 02:59:48,440
It'll just tell it to me.

1520
02:59:48,440 --> 03:00:15,770
Oh, shit.

1521
03:00:15,770 --> 03:00:16,809
So he's a demon.

1522
03:00:16,809 --> 03:00:25,690
Turned him on me?

1523
03:01:08,860 --> 03:01:11,530
Whoa.

1524
03:01:11,530 --> 03:01:12,489
The heck, dude?

1525
03:01:13,500 --> 03:01:14,620
What the fuck?

1526
03:01:14,620 --> 03:01:20,250
Okay.

1527
03:01:20,250 --> 03:01:32,110
No, they're not personal pizzas.

1528
03:01:32,110 --> 03:01:32,670
What?

1529
03:01:32,670 --> 03:01:43,440
Did that guy get up?

1530
03:01:43,440 --> 03:01:44,399
Open the door?

1531
03:01:44,399 --> 03:01:45,040
I don't...

1532
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:45,760
I can't.

1533
03:01:45,760 --> 03:01:47,879
There's another...

1534
03:01:47,879 --> 03:01:50,120
There's an old key in the drawer with the ID in it.

1535
03:01:50,120 --> 03:01:52,379
Are you shitting me?

1536
03:01:52,379 --> 03:02:02,079
Oh, man.

1537
03:02:02,079 --> 03:02:03,290
Wait.

1538
03:02:03,290 --> 03:02:06,280
How do I pick it up?

1539
03:02:06,280 --> 03:02:07,959
Mr. Delva's extra keys.

1540
03:02:07,959 --> 03:02:08,760
How do I use them?

1541
03:02:08,760 --> 03:02:11,819
Why can't I pick them up?

1542
03:02:11,819 --> 03:02:18,649
Okay.

1543
03:02:18,649 --> 03:02:19,610
Well, let's go.

1544
03:02:19,610 --> 03:02:23,280
Yeah, fuck that guy.

1545
03:02:23,280 --> 03:02:23,680
Who cares?

1546
03:02:48,319 --> 03:03:04,600
What the hell?

1547
03:03:04,600 --> 03:03:05,559
Can't you hear me?

1548
03:03:13,790 --> 03:03:14,030
Wait.

1549
03:03:14,030 --> 03:03:14,829
That's a...

1550
03:03:14,829 --> 03:03:16,590
That's TTT9.

1551
03:03:39,739 --> 03:03:40,540
You!

1552
03:03:40,540 --> 03:03:49,049
Is Raymond here?

1553
03:03:49,049 --> 03:03:52,829
Do you see what he's doing?

1554
03:03:52,829 --> 03:03:54,350
Do this to someone.

1555
03:03:54,350 --> 03:03:56,719
I think you should let me out.

1556
03:04:01,260 --> 03:04:02,860
You ain't going anywhere.

1557
03:04:02,860 --> 03:04:03,340
Shut up.

1558
03:04:07,500 --> 03:04:09,100
I want wishes.

1559
03:04:09,100 --> 03:04:11,340
I want wishes or you ain't going anywhere.

1560
03:04:11,340 --> 03:04:12,459
I want wishes.

1561
03:04:12,459 --> 03:04:15,530
You'll be here soon.

1562
03:04:15,530 --> 03:04:16,969
I want wishes and I'll let you out.

1563
03:04:16,969 --> 03:04:25,559
Three of them.

1564
03:04:25,559 --> 03:04:26,920
It's a simple trade.

1565
03:04:26,920 --> 03:04:28,750
I let you out?

1566
03:04:28,750 --> 03:04:30,110
You give me three wishes.

1567
03:04:30,110 --> 03:04:31,389
You give me whatever I want.

1568
03:04:31,389 --> 03:04:36,969
But you have to promise not to kill me when you get out.

1569
03:04:36,969 --> 03:04:37,610
That's my...

1570
03:04:37,610 --> 03:04:38,809
That's what I have to say.

1571
03:04:38,809 --> 03:04:42,010
I know every time that in a movie when this happens,

1572
03:04:42,010 --> 03:04:43,129
it's typically,

1573
03:04:44,159 --> 03:04:47,040
oh, I summoned fucking Voldemort.

1574
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:47,440
Whatever.

1575
03:04:47,440 --> 03:04:49,719
And they just like the second they get out,

1576
03:04:49,719 --> 03:04:50,520
they kill the first person,

1577
03:04:50,520 --> 03:04:53,020
which is usually the person that summoned them, right?

1578
03:04:53,020 --> 03:04:53,899
And why is that?

1579
03:04:53,899 --> 03:04:55,020
That's fucked up.

1580
03:04:55,020 --> 03:04:57,950
Can we go over this just very quickly?

1581
03:04:57,950 --> 03:05:00,430
That's fucked up.

1582
03:05:00,430 --> 03:05:02,510
Every time that in any video game,

1583
03:05:02,510 --> 03:05:03,229
in any movie,

1584
03:05:03,229 --> 03:05:04,030
any TV show,

1585
03:05:04,590 --> 03:05:08,680
the guy that spends his entire lifetime summoning

1586
03:05:08,680 --> 03:05:11,239
or bringing back the ultimate bad guy

1587
03:05:11,879 --> 03:05:16,620
is the first person for the ultimate bad guy to kill.

1588
03:05:16,700 --> 03:05:19,610
It's unfair.

1589
03:05:19,610 --> 03:05:21,770
That's absolutely not fair.

1590
03:05:21,770 --> 03:05:32,239
Do you know how hard it was to bring you back?

1591
03:05:32,239 --> 03:05:33,760
That's unfair.

1592
03:05:33,760 --> 03:05:45,690
I'll mark this one down as maybe.

1593
03:05:46,809 --> 03:05:52,489
Maybe we'll come back.

1594
03:05:52,489 --> 03:05:56,040
What about Peter Pettigrew?

1595
03:05:56,040 --> 03:05:56,440
All right.

1596
03:05:56,440 --> 03:05:58,520
All I remember from Peter Pettigrew is this.

1597
03:06:02,780 --> 03:06:05,159
That's it.

1598
03:06:05,159 --> 03:06:26,139
That's all I remember.

1599
03:06:26,139 --> 03:06:26,379
All right.

1600
03:06:26,379 --> 03:06:28,600
So now what?

1601
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:34,559
It's this guy smiling.

1602
03:06:34,559 --> 03:06:35,920
Go get her blood.

1603
03:06:35,920 --> 03:06:40,520
Wait, go get her blood?

1604
03:06:40,520 --> 03:06:41,159
Get the blood.

1605
03:06:41,159 --> 03:06:42,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1606
03:06:42,120 --> 03:06:45,399
You mean go get the blood that was next to her and use it here?

1607
03:06:45,399 --> 03:06:46,879
Where should I use it?

1608
03:06:46,879 --> 03:06:52,270
The bottles of her blood.

1609
03:06:53,680 --> 03:06:55,440
All the reagents are her blood.

1610
03:06:55,440 --> 03:06:56,719
Yeah, that's what I'm imagining.

1611
03:07:00,520 --> 03:07:03,899
Yeah, this is all her.

1612
03:07:03,899 --> 03:07:05,260
Yeah, it's all this is all her.

1613
03:07:05,260 --> 03:07:07,290
I already have it.

1614
03:07:07,290 --> 03:07:10,219
Yeah, that's scary.

1615
03:07:11,530 --> 03:07:12,170
All right.

1616
03:07:12,170 --> 03:07:12,889
Where was I?

1617
03:07:14,079 --> 03:07:14,399
Right.

1618
03:07:14,399 --> 03:07:15,600
We have to do this.

1619
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:22,110
That was scary.

1620
03:07:22,110 --> 03:07:22,350
All right.

1621
03:07:22,350 --> 03:07:23,549
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1622
03:07:23,549 --> 03:07:23,790
Let me.

1623
03:07:24,649 --> 03:07:24,969
Okay.

1624
03:07:24,969 --> 03:07:25,290
Okay.

1625
03:07:25,290 --> 03:07:25,530
Okay.

1626
03:07:25,530 --> 03:07:25,690
Okay.

1627
03:07:25,690 --> 03:07:25,930
Okay.

1628
03:07:25,930 --> 03:07:26,090
Okay.

1629
03:07:26,090 --> 03:07:26,489
Come on.

1630
03:07:26,489 --> 03:07:26,649
Fine.

1631
03:07:26,649 --> 03:07:27,850
I gotta get back into this before I die.

1632
03:07:40,860 --> 03:07:41,659
Get the tubes.

1633
03:07:48,590 --> 03:07:49,629
And let's pump.

1634
03:07:49,629 --> 03:07:54,639
What's wrong?

1635
03:07:55,200 --> 03:07:59,870
What's wrong?

1636
03:08:04,540 --> 03:08:05,420
You already did this.

1637
03:08:13,290 --> 03:08:14,090
Wait, here comes.

1638
03:08:14,090 --> 03:08:15,850
Let me in, you bitch.

1639
03:08:15,850 --> 03:08:16,729
All right, this is it.

1640
03:08:25,629 --> 03:08:26,909
No, no, I didn't want to let you in.

1641
03:08:26,909 --> 03:08:27,950
Don't you miss me?

1642
03:08:36,299 --> 03:08:41,290
Maybe you could slit your wrist for me.

1643
03:08:41,290 --> 03:08:46,079
Just a little cut.

1644
03:08:46,079 --> 03:08:47,280
What's wrong?

1645
03:09:05,850 --> 03:09:08,170
I ain't ever inviting grandma to Christmas ever again.

1646
03:09:12,110 --> 03:09:12,350
Sorry.

1647
03:09:12,350 --> 03:09:12,829
That was weird.

1648
03:09:12,829 --> 03:09:14,110
I was like, why can't I not press the button?

1649
03:09:22,239 --> 03:09:22,639
All right.

1650
03:09:23,629 --> 03:09:24,860
Pump.

1651
03:09:24,860 --> 03:09:25,659
Turn off pump.

1652
03:09:25,659 --> 03:09:27,659
Remove tubes and fill.

1653
03:09:52,479 --> 03:09:52,959
How do I?

1654
03:09:52,959 --> 03:09:54,559
Somebody said, go kill the basement lady.

1655
03:09:54,559 --> 03:09:55,120
I don't know how.

1656
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:56,860
How do I do that?

1657
03:09:58,879 --> 03:09:59,520
Oh, shit.

1658
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:00,239
Something's going to happen.

1659
03:10:00,239 --> 03:10:00,959
Something's about to happen.

1660
03:10:00,959 --> 03:10:01,680
Something's going to happen.

1661
03:10:01,680 --> 03:10:12,569
I'm sitting in the corner.

1662
03:10:12,569 --> 03:10:13,129
Her mark.

1663
03:10:14,700 --> 03:10:22,040
Oh, wait, it was tear, tear, parka, parka, tear, parka, parka, tear.

1664
03:10:22,040 --> 03:10:26,809
I can't do it.

1665
03:10:26,809 --> 03:10:27,850
I can't do it.

1666
03:10:27,850 --> 03:10:33,370
What?

1667
03:10:33,370 --> 03:10:34,409
Yeah, I can't.

1668
03:10:34,729 --> 03:10:40,829
It's three T's.

1669
03:10:40,829 --> 03:10:42,110
There's tiles in the basement.

1670
03:10:45,920 --> 03:10:46,319
Whatever.

1671
03:10:47,440 --> 03:10:51,520
What is it again?

1672
03:10:53,819 --> 03:10:55,739
Such YouTuber reactions.

1673
03:10:55,739 --> 03:10:56,350
All right.

1674
03:10:56,350 --> 03:10:57,389
Who was this?

1675
03:10:57,389 --> 03:11:00,120
It was Tell Duck, right?

1676
03:11:00,120 --> 03:11:02,120
Bong, Hearthstone, Pi, Jay.

1677
03:11:04,329 --> 03:11:06,170
Bong, Hearthstone, Pi, Jay.

1678
03:11:06,170 --> 03:11:08,399
All right.

1679
03:11:08,399 --> 03:11:09,280
All right.

1680
03:11:09,280 --> 03:11:11,200
Why does the thunder scare you?

1681
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:12,559
I don't know, because it's just sudden.

1682
03:11:13,530 --> 03:11:14,090
All right.

1683
03:11:14,090 --> 03:11:14,889
Yeah, I get it.

1684
03:11:14,889 --> 03:11:15,209
Come on.

1685
03:11:15,209 --> 03:11:15,530
Hurry up.

1686
03:11:16,840 --> 03:11:17,319
Stop it.

1687
03:11:18,040 --> 03:11:22,079
I'm fine.

1688
03:11:50,860 --> 03:11:51,420
There we go.

1689
03:11:53,209 --> 03:11:53,530
Okay.

1690
03:11:55,049 --> 03:11:56,250
Let's put you.

1691
03:11:57,370 --> 03:11:58,409
Oh, I don't want to leave.

1692
03:11:58,409 --> 03:12:05,149
I don't want to go back in here because the grandma's here.

1693
03:12:05,149 --> 03:12:05,790
Uh-oh.

1694
03:12:05,790 --> 03:12:15,790
Oh, don't you want to say hi and hello to your grandmother?

1695
03:12:15,790 --> 03:12:17,069
I'm so scared.

1696
03:12:17,069 --> 03:12:20,000
Don't you want to say hi to your grandmother?

1697
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,239
No, don't you want to say hi to your grandmother?

1698
03:12:43,209 --> 03:12:44,329
It's definitely you.

1699
03:12:44,329 --> 03:12:45,610
Burn, I've got the coins, right?

1700
03:12:46,170 --> 03:12:51,950
All right.

1701
03:12:51,950 --> 03:12:52,510
Okay, it's time.

1702
03:12:52,510 --> 03:12:52,829
It's time.

1703
03:12:52,829 --> 03:12:53,229
It's time.

1704
03:12:53,229 --> 03:12:54,110
Let's put it on.

1705
03:12:54,110 --> 03:13:09,200
So you're saying if I do this now, I get a super ending.

1706
03:13:19,530 --> 03:13:21,450
Do you think it's the wrong one?

1707
03:13:23,610 --> 03:13:25,680
I wonder if it's the right one.

1708
03:13:29,639 --> 03:13:29,959
Okay.

1709
03:13:29,959 --> 03:13:32,200
So now I'm going to get a secret ending.

1710
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:39,639
I have 10 year coin, five year coin and the necklace.

1711
03:13:39,639 --> 03:13:40,440
Am I good?

1712
03:13:41,159 --> 03:13:53,159
Surely.

1713
03:13:53,159 --> 03:13:53,559
Surely.

1714
03:13:53,559 --> 03:13:53,959
Surely.

1715
03:13:54,600 --> 03:13:57,610
Double check your stuff.

1716
03:13:57,610 --> 03:14:00,329
Yeah, I got my coins and I got the necklace, right?

1717
03:14:01,049 --> 03:14:04,479
See you later.

1718
03:14:06,510 --> 03:14:06,750
What?

1719
03:14:09,549 --> 03:14:10,270
What are you talking about?

1720
03:14:12,719 --> 03:14:13,600
Um, what?

1721
03:14:14,399 --> 03:14:15,799
Where's the fucking power?

1722
03:14:16,520 --> 03:14:17,920
Where's the power?

1723
03:14:31,549 --> 03:14:32,030
Oh, no.

1724
03:14:32,430 --> 03:14:33,389
It's gonna get up.

1725
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:45,639
Oh, I just fell.

1726
03:14:46,600 --> 03:14:48,120
I just literally tripped.

1727
03:14:48,120 --> 03:14:49,000
There was nothing scary.

1728
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:50,280
I just tripped on the rug.

1729
03:14:50,280 --> 03:15:09,950
How do I turn it on?

1730
03:15:09,950 --> 03:15:10,270
What?

1731
03:15:11,520 --> 03:15:13,600
I need the tiles from the basement.

1732
03:15:13,600 --> 03:15:25,850
I don't want to go back in the fucking basement.

1733
03:15:25,850 --> 03:16:09,479
Dude, where?

1734
03:16:09,479 --> 03:16:10,440
Oh, you were full of shit.

1735
03:16:10,440 --> 03:16:11,159
Okay, nevermind.

1736
03:16:11,159 --> 03:16:17,709
I think it might be bugged.

1737
03:16:17,709 --> 03:16:29,610
It didn't moisturize.

1738
03:16:29,610 --> 03:16:30,329
Yeah, it did look.

1739
03:16:30,329 --> 03:16:51,000
What the hell?

1740
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:57,469
I have to put him back in?

1741
03:17:10,319 --> 03:17:25,920
What?

1742
03:17:25,920 --> 03:17:35,040
Uh, why won't he go on?

1743
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:36,239
You didn't finish all the...

1744
03:17:36,239 --> 03:17:36,959
That's the last one.

1745
03:17:37,850 --> 03:17:39,549
I did it all.

1746
03:17:39,549 --> 03:17:41,149
There's a fourth body and there's none.

1747
03:18:03,920 --> 03:18:07,049
Um, what?

1748
03:18:16,040 --> 03:18:16,360
It's...

1749
03:18:16,360 --> 03:18:17,079
It bugged out?

1750
03:18:22,409 --> 03:18:24,250
Yeah, I tried the fuse box in the bathroom.

1751
03:18:24,250 --> 03:18:26,409
It didn't do anything.

1752
03:18:26,409 --> 03:18:36,239
Um, I think this is screwed up.

1753
03:18:36,239 --> 03:18:37,440
Check your tablet.

1754
03:18:37,440 --> 03:18:41,149
There are no tiles in it.

1755
03:18:41,149 --> 03:18:42,030
Yeah, there is.

1756
03:18:42,030 --> 03:18:46,409
No, that's correct.

1757
03:18:46,409 --> 03:18:52,840
I think it's screwed up.

1758
03:18:52,840 --> 03:18:55,159
Um, I just reload the game.

1759
03:18:55,159 --> 03:19:20,079
Okay, return body to cold storage.

1760
03:19:20,079 --> 03:19:24,989
So, we're back.

1761
03:19:24,989 --> 03:19:28,750
This is it right here.

1762
03:19:28,750 --> 03:19:29,709
Take the mark.

1763
03:19:29,709 --> 03:19:35,440
Here we go.

1764
03:19:35,440 --> 03:19:36,639
Yep, looks good.

1765
03:19:36,639 --> 03:19:40,030
Come with me.

1766
03:19:40,030 --> 03:19:54,559
All right, we're back in cold storage.

1767
03:19:56,760 --> 03:19:57,559
Is that good?

1768
03:20:04,959 --> 03:20:07,049
Oh.

1769
03:20:07,049 --> 03:20:07,370
Burn.

1770
03:20:08,639 --> 03:20:09,440
There we go.

1771
03:20:09,440 --> 03:20:10,319
All right, let's go for it.

1772
03:20:13,799 --> 03:20:14,840
I got the coins, right?

1773
03:20:14,840 --> 03:20:15,079
Yep.

1774
03:20:15,719 --> 03:20:25,020
Who's knocking?

1775
03:20:25,020 --> 03:20:36,799
Got it.

1776
03:20:42,750 --> 03:20:43,229
Ow.

1777
03:20:59,229 --> 03:21:00,350
So, this is a secret ending?

1778
03:21:10,989 --> 03:21:12,430
It's not a secret ending.

1779
03:21:17,399 --> 03:21:18,360
It's not a secret.

1780
03:21:27,629 --> 03:21:29,309
A secret Raymond ending.

1781
03:21:30,430 --> 03:21:34,829
Down there, right now, just suffering for no reason.

1782
03:21:34,829 --> 03:21:36,510
Valerie is not down there.

1783
03:21:40,120 --> 03:21:42,120
She's been gone for years.

1784
03:21:42,120 --> 03:21:43,239
You don't know that.

1785
03:21:46,329 --> 03:21:47,930
You're just gonna let her stay there.

1786
03:21:49,069 --> 03:21:51,709
You don't know what she's feeling.

1787
03:21:51,709 --> 03:21:53,309
You are torturing her.

1788
03:21:53,309 --> 03:21:54,750
She's helping me survive.

1789
03:21:55,389 --> 03:21:57,629
She's helping us survive.

1790
03:21:58,989 --> 03:22:01,870
Without her, there's no reagent.

1791
03:22:01,870 --> 03:22:04,670
Without the reagent, we have nothing.

1792
03:22:05,629 --> 03:22:08,510
You want to have a chance at life, it comes with a cost.

1793
03:22:09,149 --> 03:22:09,950
This cost.

1794
03:22:10,909 --> 03:22:13,790
You have to make a choice, just like I did.

1795
03:22:13,790 --> 03:22:14,590
What choice?

1796
03:22:15,229 --> 03:22:19,469
Keep her alive to just bleed her over and over again to save ourselves?

1797
03:22:20,350 --> 03:22:21,870
She can't be saved.

1798
03:22:21,870 --> 03:22:23,870
End the torture.

1799
03:22:23,870 --> 03:22:26,270
She's down there suffering for your own gain.

1800
03:22:26,270 --> 03:22:26,989
My gain?

1801
03:22:27,549 --> 03:22:28,270
My gain?

1802
03:22:29,600 --> 03:22:30,719
You used her too.

1803
03:22:31,680 --> 03:22:33,840
It didn't stop you from finishing the job.

1804
03:22:34,639 --> 03:22:36,319
You used her blood anyway.

1805
03:22:37,280 --> 03:22:40,559
When it came down to it, you chose survival.

1806
03:22:41,680 --> 03:22:42,719
Actually, you never told me that.

1807
03:22:43,840 --> 03:22:46,719
I did not come with a context of what was necessary to know that.

1808
03:22:53,950 --> 03:22:55,549
No, you drank it too.

1809
03:22:56,510 --> 03:23:00,860
I've seen many experience what you did.

1810
03:23:00,860 --> 03:23:03,079
None have survived.

1811
03:23:03,079 --> 03:23:09,340
I've watched them degrade and suffer until they're no longer themselves.

1812
03:23:09,340 --> 03:23:14,040
I didn't know what else to do and just let them suffer.

1813
03:23:14,600 --> 03:23:19,040
I searched for years to find a way to reverse it.

1814
03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:22,729
All I found was the way to prevent more.

1815
03:23:22,729 --> 03:23:26,000
Isn't that better than nothing?

1816
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:29,479
I killed them all, Rebecca.

1817
03:23:29,479 --> 03:23:32,090
It was the only thing I could do.

1818
03:23:33,770 --> 03:23:35,850
So yes, I am a monster.

1819
03:23:37,260 --> 03:23:41,659
But this one horrible thing has prevented me from having to take any more life.

1820
03:23:42,729 --> 03:23:47,760
I would choose that again and again.

1821
03:23:47,760 --> 03:23:50,639
I can't live with any more death than I already do.

1822
03:23:50,639 --> 03:23:54,829
I've made peace with it.

1823
03:23:55,389 --> 03:23:58,139
The choice is yours if you can too.

1824
03:23:58,700 --> 03:24:00,920
I'll see you tomorrow.

1825
03:24:01,559 --> 03:24:11,979
Ending four of five?

1826
03:24:11,979 --> 03:24:13,719
Wouldn't that have been three?

1827
03:24:13,719 --> 03:24:15,159
Wait, have I done this four times?

1828
03:24:15,159 --> 03:24:21,389
All right, that was fun.

1829
03:24:21,389 --> 03:24:22,750
Oh, okay, I see.

1830
03:24:22,750 --> 03:24:27,260
You messed up the coin ending.

1831
03:24:27,260 --> 03:24:29,579
You need to get the coins and necklace from the apartment

1832
03:24:29,579 --> 03:24:33,370
then pick up two more coins from the drawer in the mortuary.

1833
03:24:33,370 --> 03:24:36,649
Oh, well, whatever.

1834
03:24:36,649 --> 03:24:39,389
All right, get the possessed ending.

1835
03:24:40,250 --> 03:24:41,530
No, I gotta go.

1836
03:24:41,530 --> 03:24:45,530
I'm hungry and I've been sitting here for a while.

1837
03:24:45,530 --> 03:24:49,610
I know it doesn't seem that long but I'm still dealing with some problems.

1838
03:24:49,610 --> 03:24:55,930
It's because you're scared.

1839
03:24:58,719 --> 03:24:59,680
This is great.

1840
03:25:01,399 --> 03:25:03,159
The scares were really interesting.

1841
03:25:03,159 --> 03:25:07,040
Turning the corner and just kind of seeing a person just standing there.

1842
03:25:07,040 --> 03:25:08,840
It's just weird.

1843
03:25:08,840 --> 03:25:11,209
It's creepy.

1844
03:25:11,209 --> 03:25:12,170
This is fun.

1845
03:25:12,170 --> 03:25:14,170
Mortuary assistant.

1846
03:25:17,920 --> 03:25:18,879
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1847
03:25:18,879 --> 03:25:23,579
Tomorrow we're going to play Two Point Campus and maybe something else.

1848
03:25:23,579 --> 03:25:24,700
Pulted Lamb is out too, right?

1849
03:25:24,700 --> 03:25:25,579
Maybe I'll do that.

1850
03:25:25,579 --> 03:25:30,719
Two Point Campus is going to be sponsored

1851
03:25:30,719 --> 03:25:33,520
and I'm thinking about playing it so that's awesome.

1852
03:25:33,520 --> 03:25:36,680
The sponsor streams have been amazing by the way.

1853
03:25:36,680 --> 03:25:38,920
It's just stuff that I want to play.

1854
03:25:38,920 --> 03:25:40,360
Stuff that I'm really interested in playing.

1855
03:25:41,399 --> 03:25:44,219
I'm already interested so that's been great.

1856
03:25:44,540 --> 03:25:48,750
Pulted Lamb is not sponsored.

1857
03:25:48,750 --> 03:25:49,870
Yeah, I would just be playing it.

1858
03:25:49,870 --> 03:25:55,819
So I'm really happy about it so far.

1859
03:25:55,819 --> 03:25:58,750
I hope the sponsor streams have been good.

1860
03:25:59,709 --> 03:26:03,709
You know, I obviously want to play games that people would probably want to watch.

1861
03:26:04,270 --> 03:26:07,920
Pulted Lamb is a 10 out of 10.

1862
03:26:13,629 --> 03:26:14,909
Maybe I'll open with that.

1863
03:26:14,909 --> 03:26:19,129
Play that for like two or three hours and then do Two Point Campus for a few hours.

1864
03:26:19,129 --> 03:26:20,860
We'll figure it out.

1865
03:26:20,860 --> 03:26:25,260
The sponsor streams feel like a normal stream.

1866
03:26:25,260 --> 03:26:28,090
That's really what I'm looking for.

1867
03:26:34,840 --> 03:26:35,319
All right, cool.

1868
03:26:36,510 --> 03:26:37,629
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1869
03:26:37,709 --> 03:26:40,649
I'm going to start probably around like 2?

1870
03:26:40,649 --> 03:26:42,750
2 PM? 3 PM?

1871
03:26:42,750 --> 03:26:49,120
We'll make it 3 just in case.

1872
03:26:49,120 --> 03:26:50,559
Thanks for watching everybody.

1873
03:26:50,559 --> 03:26:52,319
The Call of Duty tournament was really fun.

1874
03:26:52,319 --> 03:26:54,110
It's cool to hang out.

1875
03:26:54,110 --> 03:26:56,040
Play with Myth.

1876
03:26:56,040 --> 03:26:59,309
It's like, who knows?

1877
03:26:59,309 --> 03:27:01,389
I want to get these guys over to multiverses.

1878
03:27:01,389 --> 03:27:02,030
You know what I mean?

1879
03:27:02,030 --> 03:27:04,350
It's like, who played multiverses the other day?

1880
03:27:04,350 --> 03:27:05,309
Yesterday or whatever.

1881
03:27:05,309 --> 03:27:17,870
I love that game.

1882
03:27:17,870 --> 03:27:19,309
Let's play the game I'm good at.

1883
03:27:26,680 --> 03:27:27,719
All right, let's see you tomorrow.

1884
03:27:27,719 --> 03:27:31,200
Thanks again.

1885
03:27:31,200 --> 03:27:35,819
If you're still here from Connor.

1886
03:27:35,819 --> 03:27:36,540
A little bit late.

1887
03:27:36,540 --> 03:27:47,079
Started late though.

1888
03:27:47,079 --> 03:27:49,879
Green Screen Part 2 is going to be on Sunday.

1889
03:27:49,879 --> 03:27:56,520
That'll be the last real stream that you see here until baseball.

1890
03:27:56,520 --> 03:28:03,770
Because we're probably going to do just a little hangout session before baseball.

1891
03:28:03,770 --> 03:28:04,889
Kind of like Dollhouse.

1892
03:28:04,889 --> 03:28:11,469
I'm not going to be giving that much info because it's not as elaborate as Dollhouse was.

1893
03:28:11,469 --> 03:28:14,670
Where you need to know about the game being played in the background.

1894
03:28:14,670 --> 03:28:17,930
I had to kind of explain that before the stream.

1895
03:28:17,930 --> 03:28:20,440
But we'll hang out.

1896
03:28:20,440 --> 03:28:21,319
I'll talk about it.

1897
03:28:21,319 --> 03:28:22,440
Try to hype it up a little bit.

1898
03:28:22,440 --> 03:28:29,069
This is not the right music by the way.

1899
03:28:29,069 --> 03:28:30,590
This music is scary.

1900
03:28:30,590 --> 03:28:35,870
You need to explain the rules of baseball to chat.

1901
03:28:35,870 --> 03:28:43,450
August 19th.

1902
03:28:43,450 --> 03:28:45,370
430 p.m. Pacific.

1903
03:28:45,370 --> 03:28:46,319
Be here.

1904
03:28:46,319 --> 03:28:50,440
The German Baseball Association.

1905
03:28:50,440 --> 03:28:53,549
That's in the middle of the season so.

1906
03:28:53,549 --> 03:28:59,079
Good night guys.

1907
03:28:59,079 --> 03:29:00,250
Call your mother.

1908
03:29:00,250 --> 03:29:01,629
Take care of yourselves.

1909
03:29:01,629 --> 03:29:02,670
Have a great day.

1910
03:29:02,670 --> 03:29:03,920
Have a great night.

1911
03:29:03,920 --> 03:29:05,389
And goodbye.
