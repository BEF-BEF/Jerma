1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,780
Don't let him. Don't let him get away with this. Don't let him get away. He's not here. He was

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:13,830
here 45 seconds after he said he was gonna be. Don't let him get away with this. Controller.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:30,570
Hi everybody. Can't get away with it. Welcome back to another unfilled few days coming up here.

4
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:43,000
Move some stuff. Did that tweet go through? Did you see it? What's wrong with my audio?

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,179
Uh, what's wrong? What's wrong with your audio? Go in the back of your speakers and grab that

6
00:00:51,179 --> 00:01:00,380
little cord that connects to your headphones or whatever and just you'll get it. This is not like

7
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:15,989
an AM radio station but man it might work. Touch that dial now. Where's the baking stream? Uh,

8
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:27,049
Friday. Easy Bake Oven Stream is Friday. Green Screen DLC for free is Saturday. What's wrong

9
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:37,030
with your face? I don't know. Nothing. It's perfect. Just the way that God made me.

10
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:54,709
Okay? God gave me this big bump in my nose and that's the way that he created me. Don't blame

11
00:01:54,709 --> 00:02:01,480
that shit on God. And then all of a sudden I get interrupted. Excuse me. No, no. That's not how it

12
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:10,439
happened actually. I gave you a perfectly sculpted nose and you broke it on a trampoline. You jumped

13
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,719
on a trampoline and landed on your back and your knees came back and hit you in the face

14
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:29,539
and broke your nose. I was perfect. That's kind of what happened actually. Real story. Add it to

15
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:38,810
the wiki. I could say anything and you guys would add it to the wiki? Okay. How about um, I was,

16
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:55,349
okay, I was born with an extra pair of hands. I had 20 fingers. Okay. That's all that. I was

17
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:03,500
gonna put it on there. We knew that already. It's already there. It's just there already.

18
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,780
Now we're gonna play Saw today. I know people, we were in the pre-stream chat talking about this

19
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,740
and it was like, what are we gonna do today? It was a one-guy opportunity but I didn't see

20
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:22,599
any that I didn't want to, I didn't take any one-guy opportunity of. Does this game suck?

21
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:34,039
That's, that's my question. We got the illusion of choice. No, you got the reality of suggestion.

22
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:50,650
I will take your suggestions but that doesn't mean I'm gonna do them. Hurry up and stream the

23
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:59,590
fucking game. It's been four minutes. I'm just, I am one of the only people on this website and

24
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,629
I'm gonna, I'm gonna toot my own horn. I'm one of the only damn people on this website that starts

25
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:10,150
their stream within like five minutes of pressing the fucking button, okay? So give me a little bit

26
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:20,060
of that slack. I deserve it. I deserve that and I just got a bunch of money. Holy shit. I deserve it.

27
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:28,860
No, but for real, I may, I may start my streams late but when I turn, when I hit that fucking

28
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:35,100
button, we go within five minutes. I know a lot of people on this website give you like a 20 to 30

29
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,620
minute window at the beginning where they turn their streams on. Like some people have like a

30
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:48,839
15, 20, 30, 40 minute intro and that's how they run their business. But I run my business, you know,

31
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:59,220
with wrappers open and ice cream half eaten and shit. The prices are very low. Uh, Freddy gave 50

32
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:14,500
subs. 50 community subs from Freddy Dredd. Freddy's back again. Derma sucks lol. What the fuck?

33
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,120
I seriously wonder what would happen in this community. If you don't, we're gonna do an

34
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,899
experiment one day. I'm not gonna tell you when, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna see. I'm gonna have a

35
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:36,439
starting soon screen that has like a 25 minute countdown. I wonder how many of you guys would,

36
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:46,199
at like the 18 minute mark, I'm just gonna crack and be like, where is he? Where is he? Get up!

37
00:05:50,040 --> 00:06:03,449
Give me the stream. I'd crack at 28. Yeah, you'd crack at the one minute mark. Roast him. Roast him.

38
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:10,019
Roast him. Why am I, don't roast me. What did I do? But Freddy, seriously, that's another fucking

39
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:19,370
50 community subs. It's insane. What do you say we get started? Hey, it's been, it's been exactly

40
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,449
seven minutes since I've pressed the stream button. And uh, what was that? Oh look, right here, right

41
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:40,170
here. I'm ready. Okay, here we go. New game, let's go. I don't know who, wait, what is this?

42
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:49,459
Why are you linking me to this? I don't know who Derma95 is and thanks to this game, I never want

43
00:06:49,459 --> 00:07:04,779
to know. Oh, uh, Space Form Derma Slots is a slots game, like the strip slot son, what?

44
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:13,699
Midi game, ignore it. Yeah, whatever. Well, what do you want me to do? This is, if somebody has an

45
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:21,139
opinion on something, whatever. You can't expect every person that ever, well, hold on a minute,

46
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:24,980
this person doesn't understand every single reference that's ever been made on this stream?

47
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,939
He has not had the countless amount of experiences that we've had. I'm just like a,

48
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:36,680
I'm just a dickhead on his stream, uh, his steam recommended list. Like imagine seeing that Derma

49
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,279
Life is Pain face and clicking on that and being like, who is this fucking person? I don't give a

50
00:07:40,279 --> 00:08:03,060
shit about this guy. What do you want me to do? It's whatever. It's, you can't have people like

51
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:09,610
just every single ever experience that I ever have with another person online. He's gonna,

52
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:16,220
somebody's not going to be happy. It's fine. It's all right. Just wait till they see this,

53
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,540
when they see the shpee video and I guarantee you, they'll be fucking, they'll be on board.

54
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:30,709
Where's the, where's the scary game? Scary cam? No, no, I'm not doing, there's no, but this is not

55
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:46,820
a scary game. Like the audio settings, let's run with the audio setting. Is that like, give me an A,

56
00:08:47,779 --> 00:09:04,440
give me a B. What's that spell? This is like a, what should I do? Which one of these,

57
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,600
I already like put, I just come in and I go like this and then I start the game.

58
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:24,740
Let him out. Help him. I don't know where he is. It's me. I think it's me. This is fine. No,

59
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:33,909
I hate, I don't want the music. Five. All right. You guys ready? Wait, I have to one, two, three,

60
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:38,309
four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Hold on. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

61
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:44,230
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen. Is it synced? One, two, three, four, five, six,

62
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:56,179
seven, eight, nine, ten. Is it synced? Good. You should be seeing it. Okay. We're good.

63
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,460
All right. Let's go. This game's, I'm not, this game, we're going to be done in probably like 10

64
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:15,659
minutes. Normal or insane mode? I don't want to play this game on insane. Why would I pick insane?

65
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,240
No, we're doing some fucking, we're doing some normal. Some clues are revealed in the dark.

66
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:34,169
$50, $100. Holy shit. Hold on. Every choice has a consequence. Wait, there's consequences? Is

67
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:51,690
this like a bad, is this like a gory game? It's a telltale game. It's Saw. Yeah, but it's

68
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:57,750
Saw the video game. That doesn't follow the movies. Like SpongeBob Battle for the Bikini

69
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:05,019
Bottom was not based on a SpongeBob episode. They just made a game. Wait, this does happen

70
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:51,240
in the movie. Looks like this is keyed in. Okay. So get the key that's in your eyeball.

71
00:11:52,120 --> 00:12:13,580
Here's what happens. Whoa. It's waiting for one of these times that he like kind of

72
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,860
forgets the key. He's just sitting right on the table. He's watching. He's like, oh shit.

73
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,179
Oh wow. There's like 40 more people in other rooms. I'm doing it. Left stick.

74
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:38,100
Wait, do I have a key? Wait, what am I supposed to be doing? Press B. Oh, I pressed B.

75
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:46,070
It's a QTE. I don't have an Xbox controller, man. What the fuck?

76
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:11,289
Escape the bathroom. There it is. Okay. Wait, should I look at the things in the ground? What's

77
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:22,490
that? Have you a health bar in this game? What are you fucking even doing this game? Wait.

78
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,519
One, three. I just figured out a puzzle. One, three, four. Okay. I just didn't even mean to do that.

79
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:47,700
Wait, no. Four, one, four, three. What is this? This isn't doing something else. What is this

80
00:13:47,700 --> 00:14:06,299
doing? Four, three. Why is it doing this? Four, three, seven. Four, three, seven. Okay. Four,

81
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:17,850
three, seven. That's a puzzle. He definitely rushed this one. Like this game, I guess it takes place

82
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,440
after Jigsaw went public and now he's got to keep his like share prices up and he's

83
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,039
got to continuously grow and shit and you got to get like, it's got to be 100 people a day.

84
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:44,440
Also, this can't be fucking that good. Find Jigsaw's next clue. This game suck. Wait,

85
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,909
I just went in here. Oh, detective. Turns out you're a fucking idiot. You went back in the

86
00:14:49,909 --> 00:15:06,169
room that you escaped from. This is an ugly screen. Anyone out there? Help. Oh, no. That's

87
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:32,070
my room. All right. Hold on. I've got to look for achievements. What just happened? Co-op.

88
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:58,470
That's easy. You just gave me the solution. Well, what is his task? You have to dig through

89
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:07,779
needles. You have to stand there and be scared. What do you mean teamwork? Well, which one is it?

90
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,820
Do we have a timer? We have a timer. One hour and two. We've got an hour and 20 minutes, man. Just

91
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:23,590
relax. Wait, it's okay. Hold on. You are trapped. Search the toilet for the fuse before you pass out

92
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:29,110
from pain. What? What do you mean? Then use the fuse on the fuse box to power the door. Press the

93
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:42,490
green button to open the door. How do I search the grab? What the fuck? Did I get it? You know,

94
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:50,600
I got it. You have a fuse. You can use it to activate a fuse box. Turning on a fuse box will

95
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,080
power a door. Turn on lights or even create a deadly electrical trap for your enemies.

96
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,519
Once the electricity is on, watch out for nearby puddles of water.

97
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:13,319
Okay, I did it. Why are there enemies? Classifies as an enemy in a saw game.

98
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:24,759
All right, we're good. Come open the door. That was a record time. Wow, that was a good guess.

99
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:37,220
You have bare feet. Certain hazards in the environment will injure you like a broken

100
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:47,609
glass ahead. Okay. So I climb on box. Like just jump to that and climb on it and just shimmy over

101
00:17:47,609 --> 00:18:00,460
there or just lie on your back and just earthworm backwards slowly. That work? Why can't I just

102
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:14,900
jump on that? Do like cats do? Wait, that didn't even hurt. It's not really a hazard then. Okay,

103
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:26,150
just to be aware of that. I'm gonna step in that all fucking day. All right, what's in here? Do I

104
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:32,039
need to do anything or does it not matter? This door is sealed, right? This is just a game where

105
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:41,450
you do QTEs and like watch people get their heads ripped off and shit. Health hypo. Okay. Press and

106
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,609
hold X to use a health hypodermic. These will restore your health. The longer you hold down X,

107
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:57,779
the more health will be restored. Okay. Cool. Thanks. Let there be light. Press Y to turn on

108
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:01,619
your light. Right now you have a lighter. Other light sources can be found and each is unique.

109
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:09,980
First of all, hold on a minute. I got $100 from Pluto passing by and then $50 from Koike. So I

110
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,069
want to make sure I address that because there's a lot of fucking money. Pluto passing by gave

111
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:18,630
10,000 bits, a hundred fucking dollars. Jeremy, it's my 21st birthday today. Here's some birthday

112
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:25,220
bits. Thanks for making me laugh. Love you and chat. Thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.

113
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:38,759
No, no birthday face cam. I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen. Happy 21st milestone for you living

114
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:48,920
in America. Nice job. Nice job. Nice job. What am I? What do I mean? Nice job. Nice job on

115
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,339
getting there, I guess. What do you mean? Nice job. Like he didn't turn in his paper early.

116
00:19:55,339 --> 00:20:02,259
Oh, wow. You turned in your thesis like two days early. Nice job. Nice work. I mean, still,

117
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,480
Jeremy, you still got it. Oh, I wanted to talk about this. This fucking reminds me.

118
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:17,109
I actually was looking at my degree the other day. And in the in the I was going through some

119
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:21,509
personal files that I had to I wanted to get situated because obviously I moved.

120
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,509
And I got my full every class I've ever taken in every grade I've ever gotten in college.

121
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:39,220
And you want to know something funny? I got an F in pickleball. I swear I got a fucking F and

122
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:46,440
poke. I don't even know how I could prove it. I could. I have the document. I got a file. I

123
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,160
got an F. I don't know how. How do you get an F in pickleball? What do I do? I just not go.

124
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:59,980
I have no idea. We could go all of my grades. I got like an F in like a media class. I don't

125
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:06,700
even know how I got like a D my one of my GPA was. All right. This is important. I know I got a game

126
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,140
to play. What do you guys think my cumulative cumulative whatever that fucking hard to say

127
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:23,619
word is? What's my what was my GPA? What was it over the course of the whole time I was in college?

128
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:31,769
Since it's lower than four. I can tell you that it's lower than three. I can tell you that it is

129
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:38,259
higher than two and is lower than three. One point eight. You can't I don't think you can even

130
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:46,180
graduate with like a one point five. Right. Two point six. You got it. Two six. I don't even know

131
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:55,819
what that is. That's like a C. Right. Like a C plus something like that. But because I would get

132
00:21:55,819 --> 00:22:02,819
A's in some classes and then I would get F's in classes that I just didn't give a shit about.

133
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,980
It's bad. I know. Like I was either I was either I got it like an A minus or an F.

134
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:15,019
So it evened out over the years. I got a I got a light. But anyways thanks for the hundred fucking

135
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:18,700
bucks. Also Goiki thanks for the fifty dollars. Jeremy hello again. I'm excited for this game

136
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,339
because I like the movie even though it's shit. All of chat saying this game is shit too but I

137
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:30,460
don't care. I'm excited. Me too. You should be. I got an F in pickleball. I'm trying to go through

138
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,019
my brain as to where why and how that happened. That was supposed to scare me but it was too late.

139
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:48,650
That's supposed to fall when I first walk over here. But I don't say anything.

140
00:22:48,650 --> 00:23:12,380
But I have a key. I have the key. Here we go. It's gonna be another door closed. You don't walk in

141
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,339
this room. You know what you do here. You just stand right here and you peek in the room to

142
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:22,059
trigger the infrared beam that triggers when somebody comes in to try to close the door.

143
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:37,029
Peek in. Get the fuck out. And the door will slam. Bolt it shut. Wait what. Okay well oh yeah.

144
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:43,000
Why can you do this? All right go on.

145
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:10,859
Uh oh. You know how much of a pain in the ass it would be to have these

146
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,220
old TVs. Why do they have to be fucking old TVs? That's one thing I don't understand about how our

147
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,700
movies officially saw. Why isn't there like a flat screen back there? They're cheaper. You know how

148
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:26,410
hard. You know how expensive this probably is to get to work. Like this shit wasn't like this

149
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,730
like three days ago. He came down and like put a bunch of trash down here and like painted blood

150
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:37,289
on the walls and stuff. It wasn't like this down here. This is a huge project. Will you appreciate

151
00:24:37,289 --> 00:25:02,970
your life? Sure. It's his craft. Wait what. Is this a game where I'm gonna get chased by a monster?

152
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:13,430
It's not right? Uh somebody else will read this. Construction has completed on Whitehurst. Asylum

153
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:18,710
for the insane. We've finally done it. I'm told all the staff has it at nauseam and somebody

154
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:26,150
else will read this. Actually it's not that long. It's okay. I think we can make a real difference

155
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:41,430
here. Whatever somebody will read this. I can't. How do I really get chased around? How many of

156
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:52,299
these things exist? You don't do this by yourself. One guy in his like 70s is supposed to be

157
00:25:52,299 --> 00:26:22,390
able to do this. This is like a two to three hundred person project. Find the key to his

158
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:40,920
search the body. Saved a woman in the surgical theater. Okay. All right. Read file. Read the

159
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:50,900
puzzle pieces. Oh sorry. Nothing personal. I'd grab something quick though if I was you.

160
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,059
What are you talking about? You don't say sorry and then do it again.

161
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:02,309
Do I have my arm going? He hit my arm off. He took my arm off with a swing of the bat.

162
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:06,950
Combat stance. Hold the left trigger to enter combat stance with either your fist or a weapon.

163
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:16,119
Press A for a light attack and X for okay. A and X. Block with the B button. Okay.

164
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:33,980
Fucking hit him. Put the lighter down. Are you fucking serious dude? How did you miss? You missed?

165
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:51,720
How are you a detective? He punched through it. You can't block a fucking. Swing. Swing. Swing.

166
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:12,789
Oh my god. That's like scripted. Wait. Huh? What do you mean?

167
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:18,299
Did I not make it? Wait. Are you serious?

168
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:38,839
There was no autosave anywhere from that point forward. Okay. No way. What? No checkpoint?

169
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:43,660
All right. I'm gonna. Let's go. I gotta play this game. You think I'm not gonna fucking play this

170
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:56,200
game? I can't believe there's no fucking save. X. Come on. Hurry up.

171
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,710
It was four, three, seven. We don't even need to listen. Imagine. Oh detective. It's time for you

172
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:26,819
to play again. I got the door open. Wait. I. How did you do that? Not done being scary. Yep. Yep.

173
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:52,940
Yep. I know. Help. Somebody help me. Holy shit. What happened? Dude. I know. All right. Get up.

174
00:29:54,579 --> 00:30:12,009
What does give up do? I wonder. Put it in. Put it in. I think that's locked until one minute.

175
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:17,990
You can't beat that within the minute. It's locked until exactly one minute.

176
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:30,009
Don't walk on it. Fuck. Whatever. I'm strong. Okay. We're good. Take it all.

177
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:40,710
Oh yeah. Yeah. Hold X. It's dark in here. If we get up quickly, this just happens.

178
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:46,970
Because yeah. This is guy. Scary. We don't even need to watch this. We already watched it.

179
00:30:47,690 --> 00:31:06,230
Who cares what I mean? You know, we kind of, well, let's might as well. I get that. Okay. Don't

180
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:31,539
fucking lose here. I don't care. I still, that's a loud TV. Save. What do you mean save? Where?

181
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:52,859
How do I save? There is no save. What are you talking about? Save. It's too early to save.

182
00:31:53,579 --> 00:32:04,740
Okay. Yep. Yeah. There you are. I'm going to save you. All right. Here we go. This is sealed. Wait,

183
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:14,579
is this timed when this actually, did I miss a trigger point here? Did I not look down here?

184
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:23,529
Did I go too fast? Did I break the game because the TV kept playing? I didn't, right? Now that

185
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:39,059
this door is sealed, there's no way. It's probably timed. You went too, I went too fast. I did. No,

186
00:32:39,059 --> 00:33:01,339
I didn't. What the fuck did I just do? Did I just take a heal? She's dead. I stopped doing drugs.

187
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:22,950
Wait, audio tape. Oh, come on. All right. Let's go. Where is he? All right. Press A for a light

188
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:39,609
attack and X for a heavy attack. Block with B. Counter attack. What? He's got me cornered.

189
00:33:40,329 --> 00:34:11,429
Dude, this game doesn't make any sense. Attack. Attack. A. A. I am holding the trigger. It takes

190
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:25,929
so long to cue up a swing. That was before you realized there was a bomb in your brain

191
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,690
that only would activate if you said that you were going to leave

192
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:35,590
on a twist, on a twist, just like all the other ones we do.

193
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:54,230
Many of you are, somebody will read this. Wait, find detective David Tapp. I've concealed a key

194
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:30,300
inside his body. Wait, many of you will want, hold on. I can do better than this. I can do better.

195
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:47,369
All right. Let's go in here. Door's sealed. All right. Let's heal. That was completely

196
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:54,679
incomprehensible. All right. I got the door open. Save. When does this game auto save?

197
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:02,440
I'm just walking on fucking glass. God damn it. Is there more glass? Shotgun doors. Jigsaw has

198
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,400
booby trap doors in the asylum. Quickly press the appropriate button as the bullet descends.

199
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,159
If you press the wrong button or fail to press the right button, you will be on the receiving end

200
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:33,670
of a shotgun blast. Oh, great. Can I go in? Some locked doors can be picked with items around the

201
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:44,579
world or unlock. I need a pin. I need a screw. I don't want to go in here. Wait, isn't there a lady?

202
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:29,780
What the hell was that?

203
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:52,440
I can't understand. Too much. Too much. Hold on. Let me monitor. Let me hold on. What does it sound

204
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,760
like? Repeat that. How bad is it? I know I was like kind of having a funny little joke there, but like

205
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:13,260
let's see. This is really bad. It's just like a cell phone dropped call. You can't even hear

206
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:50,630
fucking anything. Hold on. This is, no, this just sounds weird. This just makes me sound like,

207
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:54,869
you know, here's the thing. The thing about this that I want to really talk about, this is

208
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:59,989
welcome to every single, every single talk ADM radio station that you've ever listened to in

209
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:05,670
your whole life. And they think they have the audacity to bring everybody back in here and

210
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:14,010
talk to this. Yeah. I gotta get this right. How's this? No. How's this? No. All right. Hold on.

211
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:23,340
Make your choice. Make your, make your, make, make your, make, make your choice. Make your, make your

212
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:37,619
choice. Make your choice. Make your choice. Let me just work. This is better. Inside there's a key.

213
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:58,650
That key. There's another key. That's better. Five nights at Freddy's.

214
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:09,590
Kylo Ren. Everything. Wait, is somebody just getting drugged over there? Is drug going into

215
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,909
that person or something? I have to go stop the drug flow? Whatever it is. All right. I'm ready.

216
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:24,630
Guys, everything is Kylo Ren. Every, every low radio voice is Kylo Ren. Wait, pick up what?

217
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:30,019
Antigen. Health item is going to be used instantly when Tap picks the item up.

218
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:41,239
Cannot be stored in Tap's inventory like health hypos. Do a dinosaur roar. All right. I'll do,

219
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:54,300
you want me to do a dinosaur roar? And then take that and lower it because that's how they did the

220
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:02,969
T-Rex. Take that lower and add like a bunch of weird shit to it. T-Rex is like a trumpet or

221
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:15,429
something, right? Isn't the T-Rex like a trumpet or a trombone that they bucked with an elephant?

222
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:27,619
What am I thinking of? Wait, that's not what it is. What's the very, very popular, I'm doing

223
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:35,610
the T-Rex like, the T-Rex sound effect is just the Jim Carrey annoying sound that they slowed down.

224
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:55,369
All right. Where the fuck am I going? It's true. Yeah. I mean, I know. Silly streamer made a silly

225
00:41:55,369 --> 00:42:03,829
noise. I need a thing to unlock this. Wait, blood. There's blood in here. There's no screws or

226
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:19,539
anything I can pick up. You have enough like a screw. I have to punch its head off. Ajax,

227
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:25,619
thanks for the five community subs. And Poofinator for the 10 community subs and my dead cat for the

228
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:47,699
10 community subs. What the fuck? That's a lot of community subs. Let's get a screw. Remember,

229
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:56,570
the screw is loose in your head. Where is this? What? I was just over here. Hold on a minute.

230
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:04,440
I opened this already and it said there's nothing in there. Fucking game sucks. Some of the doors

231
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,039
are rigged with lockpicking puzzles. I saw the puzzle rotate each piece to match the symbols

232
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,980
along the inner ring of the... I gotta pay attention. Save. There is no save. Where do you

233
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:21,619
expect me to do this? Rotate each piece to match the symbols along the inner ring of the chamber.

234
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:32,550
There is no save. There's just restore checkpoint, but that's blocked off. What the fuck is this?

235
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:58,179
What lock is this? All right. Does the game save? Where's my auto save? Save the woman in the

236
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:07,500
surgical theater. Find a key to unlock the main hallway door. Save, save, save, save. Insert your

237
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:19,539
memory card. There's a 500 gig memory card in here. Whoa. Holy shit. Let me see it. Let me see. Let

238
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:24,360
me see it. Come on. Let me see it. I haven't seen it once. What the fuck? Is this even Twitch? Is

239
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,000
this even a Twitch chat? Unbelievable. Thank you. What the fuck? I look like forever to see it.

240
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:51,590
Expect that every time. I'm sorry, Mr. Jigsaw. If you lock somebody in a room with barbed wire

241
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:58,949
around them and they have to like crawl out of it, the fuck are you talking about? You're just like

242
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:12,380
torturing people. Yeah, it was to symbolize their greed. Oh, so you wrapped barbed wire around their

243
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:20,539
head and put them in a giant meat grinder. Yeah, they were greedy. Oh, you feeling all right? Are

244
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:34,460
you all right? You drink water? That's perfect. That's a perfectly normal thing to do is wrap

245
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:40,219
somebody up, cut their arms and legs off, bury their head in sand, surgically implant

246
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:46,860
tubes in their body that they have to pull out and then connect to a wall. And then those tubes

247
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,699
then feed to another person's mouth. And yeah, the guy had insurance fraud. This might be a little

248
00:45:52,699 --> 00:46:03,099
too far. Maybe now that I think about it out loud. My name is Rose. I am eight years old. My mommy

249
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:10,010
says I have polio. Polio is bad. I have it worse than Uncle Jack. He can still walk though. He seems

250
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:14,650
drunk. So I am now in this machine. A breeze spoke me so they can call it an iron lung. Her says she

251
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,809
will write what I say once a day so my diary doesn't forget who I am. She is my only friend.

252
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:40,360
So Jigsaw, let me get this straight. Yeah, are you talking to me? So you removed a little girl who

253
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:52,409
needed this to live to put somebody that like did heroin in it. Yes. Okay. It's your choice.

254
00:46:53,050 --> 00:47:30,889
I'm going away for a fucking long time, dude. I, what's the fun of this? Who's paying the utilities?

255
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:43,860
Him? Yes, he, he made so much money that he, he, he did insurance fraud and he made $200,000 off of

256
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:48,260
other people and- Jigsaw, how much money do you have? It's not about how much money I have.

257
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:57,480
Yes, it was $6 billion to make this facility where I torture people that are bad, that we're greedy.

258
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:05,849
Jigsaw, why didn't you build like 30 schools? Well, um, because you need to be taught a lesson

259
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:12,699
and no question, you just try to get the key out of your ass. Well, I have your sternum or your eye

260
00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:19,429
wherever I decided to put it. Some of you have noticed the walls starting to buckle in some areas

261
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:24,780
and have some become permeable. Please move all violent patients out of these rooms. Thus they

262
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,900
break down the walls to escape the construction manager. I talked to some more areas so we can

263
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:34,389
break walls. The walls in the asylum are rotted and weak. Break them open to reveal a new path.

264
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:45,000
Mr. Green is just Jigsaw. No way. I feel so strong right now.

265
00:48:48,119 --> 00:49:04,860
Minecraft. Fucking Minecraft. Why? That's funny. Fuse. Okay. I got a fuse. And then can,

266
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:18,860
can the bottom drawer be opened? How do I save the game? Is there no saving? How do I save the game?

267
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:41,909
Saving is greedy. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna fucking die. What is this? The key to survival lies within.

268
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:59,420
Save the woman in the surgical theater. Find a key. Pick up the scalpel. Okay. So we get,

269
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:15,099
and what do you mean the knife will betray you? Read the toe tag. Jim Omen. Wait, do they? Hold

270
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:23,269
on. We've got like this Omen. Jay Omen doesn't have a key buried into his heart. He smoked

271
00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:28,860
cigarettes. You spent years smoking cigarettes and now die with a knife from a guy that you don't

272
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:50,090
know. M. Johnson. Okay. No. Okay. A. Faulkner. Om Robinson. Arnie Faulkner. All right, Arnie.

273
00:50:50,809 --> 00:51:21,849
I don't know what you did. What am I gonna get attacked? Okay. At what point do you make a

274
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:36,250
little noise and be like, you gotta give something a code, right? Like wiggle, like wiggle your toes,

275
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:53,539
like a Faulkner, right? Is the guy alive? Not anymore. What about this guy? This guy just dies.

276
00:51:54,099 --> 00:52:25,289
No, he's such a fucking weirdo. I wouldn't be surprised at all if that was like,

277
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:31,239
like she was eating a lot of Oreos. I just really like Oreos. Your Oreo addiction is too much

278
00:52:32,309 --> 00:53:03,579
for me to handle. The hell is this? You get it? Tech. I've determined you've had too many

279
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:09,989
Pornhub tabs open. Bolt some doors by pressing X. This will keep most enemies from opening the

280
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:21,780
door. Yeah. You're right. Pornhub tabs open. One sitting. This is unacceptable. And I'm looking

281
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:25,860
at his computer, like his computer's open. I get like into his office. He's got like 50 Pornhub

282
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:41,219
tabs open. Yeah. I can do as I say, not as I do. Right, Jigsaw? Fucking asshole. Okay. I'm getting

283
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:51,500
actually concerned about the game not saving at all ever once. This is concerning me. I have to

284
00:53:51,500 --> 00:54:01,699
sign in? How am I not signed in? You have to sign in? I am signed in. Is that really what's

285
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:23,900
fucking going on? That can't be. Is it? I'm not even fucking signed in. Your call is okay. Do you

286
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:31,449
want to exit the session and test your network? No, no, no, no, I don't. No. What did you do?

287
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:54,710
Oh my God. Thank Jesus. Wait, there is no save file. Oh my God. No. What the fuck just happened?

288
00:54:55,590 --> 00:55:13,110
Are you kidding me? Wait. Oh no. No, man. What the fuck? I can't even believe it. I can't even

289
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:18,940
believe it. No, this game. I want to play this. I can't believe it. It's not on this one. Like,

290
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:36,059
did it go somewhere else? Shit in my pants, man. Oh shit in my pants. Oh, this is just diarrhea.

291
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:47,340
Oh my God. I can't believe it. Why would it take me out? No. Oh no. I don't. I can't.

292
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:55,659
You got to be kidding me. I got to go fast. I got to go really fast. Fuck. This sucks. Just

293
00:55:55,659 --> 00:56:05,590
absolute asshole. Oh no. I want to play this. Oh, this sucks. Total ass. I can't believe it.

294
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:12,710
This is a second fucking checkpoint. Oh, God damn it. I'm so disappointed. My disappointment

295
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:19,750
just is immeasurable right now. Okay. Let's go. I'm going to go fast as hell. I'm going to skip

296
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:37,449
every cutscene. I'm going to run. I'm going to punch. And where is the prompt? There's no,

297
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:50,679
there was no prompt. I was spinning it. I'm so mad. I'm so fucking mad right now.

298
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:58,360
I'm going to need to like just be quiet and just shut my fucking mouth and beat this.

299
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:19,239
Shitload of people here right now. What the fuck happened? 8,000 people here. Okay. Fast,

300
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:32,039
fast, fast, fast. 437. I was wondering why I wasn't getting any achievements. Fucking not even. Fast.

301
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:44,360
I don't care about anything. We're not stopping. We're not helping anyone. Hey, watch it. Yep. Yeah.

302
00:57:44,360 --> 00:58:00,679
Yep. Okay. Sure. Bye. Wait, it's this one, isn't it? Which one was it? Get out of the bathroom.

303
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:16,650
I want some privacy. Okay. I'm fucking around. I'm not even trying to bump around. Get it immediately.

304
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,760
I have a full minute to do this, guys. It's not a problem.

305
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:43,510
Watch out for the barefoot. Take the pain. All right. Let's go. All right. Achievement. Yes.

306
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:47,349
Pressure. Oh my god. I was wondering why I wasn't getting these. How would I not be signed in?

307
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:54,949
How am I not signed in? How? It's impossible to not be signed in right now. All right. Speedrun. I

308
00:58:54,949 --> 00:59:07,349
gotta go. Lighter. There's a checkpoint every 15 fucking seconds. I can't believe that this

309
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:19,909
went this long without me understanding and realizing that. Wait a minute. I'm like catching

310
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:31,190
up to this guy. Am I not supposed to catch up to this dude? Wait. He's not going to be up here,

311
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:49,429
is he? Yep. Okay. There are going to be lots of sacrifices to make. Hello. Help. Yes. Get that.

312
00:59:49,989 --> 01:00:05,500
Okay. Yep. There's rugs in there. Careful. Nope. I didn't even give him a chance. Yeah. I know.

313
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:16,570
Okay. I pressed A. You just have to counter everything. Okay. We're good.

314
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:21,670
Okay. Holding. You don't understand it. You do like a full crow hop before you swing a light attack.

315
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:36,139
Why did I watch that again? I didn't need to watch that.

316
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:48,550
Door is sealed. Yep. All right. Get that key. Move. This door is sealed. All right. Go. Yep.

317
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:58,440
There's a note here. Good. Okay. Who is the jigsaw killer? I don't know. I wonder. What did

318
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:08,139
I do here? I don't even remember. What was it? Everything's sealed. What did I have to do?

319
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:15,860
There's a key inside his body. Yeah. I know. Well, how do I get the fuck out of here? Oh yeah. You.

320
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:31,719
Give me that. Okay. Bye. Glass. Yep. There's a shotgun door. All right. We're almost back.

321
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:40,340
Thank God you can skip cut scenes. I say that as I can. Okay.

322
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:43,860
Nail. Got it. Good. Okay. Everything got health.

323
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:48,099
Pick this up. Touch that. Read it so the game knows I looked at it in case I need it eventually.

324
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:51,300
Okay. Keep going. Go, go, go, go, go. Hurry the fuck up. I'm not going fast enough.

325
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:57,130
Instant health bandage. Got it. Okay. Cool. Nothing in here. Go. Out. I win.

326
01:01:57,769 --> 01:02:14,699
And in any of this shit. And that's it. Key. Unlock the door. No, I want to go down.

327
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:31,239
Out of this. All right. Go. Good. I've made it back pretty much to where I was.

328
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:39,179
Find a key to unlock the main hall. I was down here. Remember I was like, I built a school. Right.

329
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:42,699
Remember when I did that? Something like that. All right. Let's go.

330
01:02:55,300 --> 01:03:01,400
Would you like to know more? Okay. Remember there was somebody in here?

331
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:11,780
Yep. There was somebody in there. That's crazy. Okay. Remember this? The gulp. I remember the gulp.

332
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:23,480
That was pretty funny. And then there's a key. I almost just, I almost just died right there.

333
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:29,769
Okay. The key to survival lies within. Right. And then you have to, uh, cut into the, to,

334
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:39,639
Oh, right. A Minecraft punch. I don't know where to put your head. Hey, save. The game is saving.

335
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:49,159
I got it. It's fine. You're getting participation trophies.

336
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:59,860
It's always so funny. Back in the Xbox days when they, it really was just tied to if you progressed

337
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:12,550
in the game or not. What does that even supposed to mean to do? If I get it wrong

338
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:21,449
and the knife stabs me instead. All right, let's go. It's this guy, right? Yeah. It's Arnie.

339
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:37,210
All right, Arnie. Sorry. Body punches you. That's so dumb. That's real. Okay. Use the key. Yep.

340
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:56,780
Okay. Here we are. We made it in both doors. I know the Oreo lady. Yeah. Wait. Okay. This,

341
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:00,920
this is probably, there's gotta be a reason why you do that, right? Watch out for that glass.

342
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:24,599
All right. Now I just need, uh, over here. Made it. There's Mortal Kombat at himself.

343
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:31,900
Some ways through the asylum were more dangerous than others. Use left stick to walk over the

344
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:42,170
hazard and use right stick to balance. He even did like a front flip too. He treated this like

345
01:05:42,170 --> 01:06:04,809
it was a ball pit at McDonald's. All right. Is there anything else here? It's right here.

346
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:11,590
Thank God I signed it. Why would you do that? Just go across it. What the fuck are you doing?

347
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:27,670
I got the key, right? Is this guy open? Yeah, let's go. Oh, thank God. Yeah. No, it's fine.

348
01:06:33,019 --> 01:06:38,900
To be fair though, wouldn't you sprint across that shit? Why would you balance beam? No, just,

349
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:51,369
just do a full sprint and jump and leap the fuck over the whole thing. How would you balance beam

350
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:58,840
that? No, that's not the way to do it. Look at the distance here. That's not that far. If you go,

351
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:23,019
this guy had the right idea, but he just rolled off. I have like, my like steering needs to be

352
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:35,670
aligned. It pulls a little to the left. What the fuck was that kid? Freedom. Can you rescue

353
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:47,139
her detective tap? Can you rescue her detective tap? Is she in there? Hold on. Is there something

354
01:07:47,139 --> 01:08:01,880
over here? Freedom. Freedom is an illusion in $600 million facility. Is this baking soda?

355
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:09,019
Antiges. I have full health. I would have have not full health. You either fall down on the spikes

356
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:24,630
and die or that's it. What is this trying to tell me? I need to find a coupler.

357
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:39,850
All right, I got a nail. I got nothing. Unlock the cabinet. Oh, thank God. The puzzles

358
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:51,689
are 100% brainless. I mean, and I mean 100%. Like there's been nothing that you really need

359
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:57,270
to even spend more than one to two full seconds understanding how it works. That just makes me

360
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:07,500
happy. I don't want to do puzzles and shit. Fuck that. Who wants to do puzzles? I said the fine

361
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:30,390
thing. He's dumb. I mean, that's fine. It's a checkpoint. Okay. Now what? Dig saw box open.

362
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:41,670
Who am I? Name blacked out. Patient ID 825-3612-3127. April 14, 1998. Fund initial

363
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:48,949
assessment, whoever it is, presents as well as a well-spoken man with a firm grasp upon reality.

364
01:09:48,949 --> 01:09:55,909
Patient 34 years old, married for two years with wife four months pregnant, denies necessity of

365
01:09:55,909 --> 01:10:01,189
psychological treatment but is kept appointment at the request of his wife with sister visitation

366
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:05,829
due to a concern of a growing isolationistic tendencies. Patient displays high degree of

367
01:10:05,829 --> 01:10:11,590
verbal acuity and is very observant. Initial test suggest a very high IQ with an extraordinary

368
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:17,029
ability to recall facts but their expressed pride in his intelligence and knowledge

369
01:10:17,029 --> 01:10:20,630
exhibit who cares about any of this. Patient is polite and cordial. All right, that's all I need

370
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:27,109
to know. They have an affection for his wife and animals and stuff. He's not. Let's display them.

371
01:10:27,109 --> 01:10:32,630
After initial consultation, they don't need to come in anymore. They just follow up here.

372
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:36,470
Patient displays tendencies towards depression and narcissistic personality disorder. Okay.

373
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:49,930
What was I hopping for? Come on, game. What the fuck is this? Where's the blood?

374
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:57,750
Well, ask in you. Wait, a crutch? I want the crutch. The crutch is definitely more powerful.

375
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:25,109
I just bolted. I'm just going to queue it up. All right. It's the swing is so bad. Just counter

376
01:11:25,109 --> 01:11:36,090
everything. Only parry. Oh no, not another one of these. All right. Just take it slow. Don't be an

377
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:55,960
idiot. All right. I feel like I'm playing condemned. Where's the guy that's going to run around the

378
01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:15,579
corner? The two by four with a big tray. Oh, it's okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. A pipe. No, I want the

379
01:12:15,579 --> 01:12:25,300
crutch. I can't help two items. Just put one down your pants. Like slide the pipe down your like

380
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,500
back or front of your underwear. What do you mean? You don't have a pocket or something. Just take

381
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:52,329
it. You might need it. Dual welding. Sorry. Wielding dual wielding. I go down here. I feel

382
01:12:52,329 --> 01:13:05,899
like I'm not supposed to be over here. Oh, yes, I am. All right. Checkpoint is faster than I am.

383
01:13:05,899 --> 01:13:10,520
Are we in this? The cop that's been chasing you and interrogating me.

384
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:18,500
You see here the face is obsession and to make a choice, your life will depend.

385
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:43,420
Is this her? I got the fuse. Dark. Darkness also illuminates. I guess. I don't know. What is it?

386
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:54,619
Writing poetry? What does that mean? Dude, one time. Did I talk about this before? I was in the store.

387
01:13:54,619 --> 01:13:59,100
This is like a year or two ago. I was in the store and there was poetry books on the shelf.

388
01:13:59,739 --> 01:14:07,500
I've talked about this before. Have we? Where it's okay. It's a poetry book. The book is probably

389
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:15,100
can't be more than 50 or 60 pages. And I don't know if this is supposed to be for like aesthetic

390
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:20,760
reasons. I don't know. I was trying to figure it out. Half of the pages, the poems were one or two

391
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:28,600
sentences and it took up the whole paper. It was just the entire page was like one sentence.

392
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:36,619
And then like the next page was like three sentences. Next page, one sentence. Oh, it

393
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:51,210
wasn't a kid's book. YouTuber poems. Oh, well, this is what? What's this? Wait, I have a fuse.

394
01:14:51,210 --> 01:15:02,039
They're going to deactivate them. All right. I did it. The room has been deactivated or something.

395
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:16,520
Oh, I was just a pinata. Don't do it. How far back will it put me? It's going to be a

396
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:39,060
audio tape. Here we go. But he's here. He's in the room. Sometimes to search the room to find the

397
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:49,899
obvious detective. Because I kind of trapped myself in here. I kind of forgot which one I turned on

398
01:15:49,899 --> 01:16:00,140
first. I've been here for a few hours. Get us both out of here. That'd be great. Sure thing,

399
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:06,119
Jake. So I'll take care of it. It's going to be really good. It's going to be really good.

400
01:16:15,159 --> 01:16:31,939
I do. He wired that wrong. That was he fucked up the wiring. He let him down.

401
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:55,369
I just got it. What? No, I pressed A on this thing.

402
01:17:00,939 --> 01:17:09,420
Okay, it's it. What about fuck the puzzle? It's in the gun draw. Oh, it's still a fuse box.

403
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:21,289
It's this one. Oh, I got the coupler. Okay, cool. I have 12 seconds. Wait, the audio tape.

404
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:46,539
Give me the audio tape quick. Too many people. I didn't even install the fuse box. Is that going

405
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:58,300
to be bad? When I blew up the room first. It was like lights on the wall. Wait, hold on.

406
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:16,010
It's a secret entrance. It's a bomb right there. What's wrong with what's going on with this one?

407
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:43,060
Yep. Rink it. Can I even do this? I didn't break the whole game. Did I? Is it broken?

408
01:18:43,619 --> 01:19:01,380
I don't think I was supposed to do this yet. I didn't get the fuse yet. Oh, where the fuck is

409
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:08,060
the fuse? Oh, right. Okay. Now I see what you're understanding here. Okay,

410
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:32,279
go. Did I just get it? I just picked it up. It's happening right now. Okay, it's lit up.

411
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:44,520
Now I have to follow the path. He was on battery acid when he did this. How did he get on the

412
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:55,609
ceiling? Well, this is like you didn't even try. This is not even right. Is that supposed to

413
01:19:55,609 --> 01:20:17,829
fuck with me? I don't even know what he's talking about. So what? I have to connect the line with

414
01:20:17,829 --> 01:20:36,069
your eyes and then the door will present itself. It's the gun. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm already way

415
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:42,789
ahead of this. My IQ is too high. I did this. I already got that. I already did this. I opened

416
01:20:42,789 --> 01:20:48,149
the gun. I did this backwards. I did this in reverse. So where do I go? What did I just get?

417
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:53,720
What do I have? Holy shit. I can't believe you did this fucking whole thing backwards.

418
01:20:54,359 --> 01:21:03,979
What does it pick up? What? Oh, crutch. What did I get for doing this? Another fuse box?

419
01:21:04,619 --> 01:21:18,279
Back up to the ladder. This game suck. Anybody know? Oh, I got the coupler. The coupler.

420
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:44,390
Who the fuck is this guy? Hey, come here. Watch out. This glass. Get over here. I'm coming up there.

421
01:21:50,229 --> 01:22:15,500
What? Why is he waiting? Wait, why did I do that? Are you all right? There's no reason. Oh my god.

422
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:27,020
I was right in the fucking mouth. And I didn't even say anything. This is... Holy shit. Um, okay.

423
01:22:28,489 --> 01:22:36,939
Wait. I, I, I... You just have to unbolt the door, dude. You just have to unbolt. Oh,

424
01:22:36,939 --> 01:22:39,979
you could have been my friend. We could have had... We could have gone together.

425
01:22:40,699 --> 01:22:48,060
I could have had a person with me instead. Holy shit. That was unbelievably horrible.

426
01:22:48,619 --> 01:22:53,479
Okay. What's in the box? Oh, nothing in the box. Just the thing that goes...

427
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:48,199
All right. I have the coupler. Now what? I got it. Everybody fucking relax. Relax. Relax. It took

428
01:23:48,199 --> 01:24:03,420
like not even 60 seconds. Lower the office. What office? This one? All right. Press button.

429
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:29,539
I got an exit. How do I get over there? Where are you going? I don't know. Where am I going?

430
01:24:29,539 --> 01:24:46,569
What do I do? Can I move this? I like drag this out of the way. Oh, there we go. Sick. Oh,

431
01:24:46,569 --> 01:25:01,350
look at that. Sick. Checkpoint. All right. I have two nails. What do I do with this shit?

432
01:25:02,069 --> 01:25:08,380
You missed a secret room. Secret room. Secret room. I'm like, I'm blind. Oh, I'm all right.

433
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:17,350
I still... What do I have? A person's leg? That's a baseball bat. Right. Okay. Let's keep going.

434
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:26,170
Glass? Who's making that noise? I'm here to rescue you. All right. Call the police. Make a

435
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:53,500
telephone call now. Okay. Somebody in there? Somebody in this room? Did I save you? Aren't

436
01:25:53,500 --> 01:26:05,050
you the police? Am I? All right. I'm the police. Oh shit. Pick up pipe. No. That's way better. No.

437
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:13,109
Pipe has more slots left. Dude, I'm telling you, man. I find somebody. I do a full combo, full five

438
01:26:13,109 --> 01:26:17,670
slot, eviscerate on somebody. Whoa. That'll do probably 700 damage and create yellow numbers.

439
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:34,949
Whatever. And there's a wow reference. Whatever. Who's this guy? He's superhuman. Barricade.

440
01:26:34,949 --> 01:26:38,789
Sometimes a bolt of door is not enough. Keep enemies from breaking through a closed and bolted

441
01:26:38,789 --> 01:26:42,550
door. Move something heavy in front of the door. But everybody's like, hey, I have a pipe. Just hit

442
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:51,060
him in the head. Just fucking hit him. I mean, you have to do this. What do you have to do?

443
01:26:51,779 --> 01:27:09,859
Well, come in. Thanks for the free item, you fucking idiot. Quick. Block the door. Barricade

444
01:27:09,859 --> 01:27:21,020
the door. I get the tutorial message. One of us. What have you had? You may have had something

445
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:31,460
very important to tell me. OK, move it back. I didn't get a no tutorial. I have to do this.

446
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:45,460
We didn't spend very much time trying to kill me. That's encouraging. Checking. Why am I

447
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:49,220
checking for items? Who cares? Just beat it. Just beat the game. This game's probably like three

448
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:57,560
hours long. OK, what's the percentage chance that this is longer than the movie? Is this game's

449
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:07,609
story mode longer than the movie that it's based on? Find out. And I just probably played for like

450
01:28:07,609 --> 01:28:12,250
three or four hours and never played this ever again. We'll see. You're never going to see this

451
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:23,619
game again. Yeah, that's a guarantee. But it only happens if you die without having been signed in.

452
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:42,149
Yeah. Oh, just. All right. Take some. Free. For the amount of health that I have and the amount

453
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:48,260
of danger I've potentially been in. I feel like insane probably wouldn't be that insane.

454
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:57,399
All right. Let's let's let's go. What the fuck? Getting a good gamers score from this.

455
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:08,470
And here is over there. I don't know. What is that? What is this? Have I been in here?

456
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:44,869
This is headphones. This is the person on the drugs. This is the minor price.

457
01:29:44,869 --> 01:30:15,579
I want that fucking vacation. Let's go. Oh, there's a key in there.

458
01:30:15,579 --> 01:30:26,180
It's sitting on the table. Wow. I can just go in and grab it. Uh oh. It's not going to be that easy.

459
01:30:26,739 --> 01:30:54,489
Crap. I really like bombs. OK, we need to find the code for the door.

460
01:30:55,289 --> 01:31:19,109
Nothing in the cabinets. Oh, shit. It's a fuse box. OK, fuse. Fuse. Can I do it? Now what? Five,

461
01:31:19,109 --> 01:31:41,420
seven, nine. Quickly. Hurry up. Five, seven. Go backwards. Still going to blow up? Uh oh.

462
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:52,649
Oh, no. No boss fight. Now I'm in another room. TVs and bombs.

463
01:31:56,899 --> 01:32:03,539
That's all this guy's got. You got a surplus of old televisions and bombs and you rescue her?

464
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:24,340
Detective Tapp? Question mark. Can you? It took a lot of yard sales for you to get

465
01:32:24,899 --> 01:32:39,260
all these TVs, Jigsaw. I mean, that's known. Where'd you get all the bombs? I don't understand.

466
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:44,600
Where do you get them? Where would he? What do you mean? Where would he have built them?

467
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:52,630
Until now, the Jigsaw Killer has never left anyone alive. Amanda Young is now the first

468
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:57,350
and only known survivor of the Jigsaw Killer. Details about Young are forthcoming. She is

469
01:32:57,350 --> 01:33:03,460
to make a statement regarding her capture. He saved my life. These are the words spoken

470
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:07,220
by Amanda Young, only known survivor of the Jigsaw Killer. I mean, at what point? Hold on.

471
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:10,899
Do we know? At what point? Where does it think we know in the story? Because this is just Saw.

472
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:23,689
I think, no, this takes place. We have seen Saw 6 at this point, or Saw 5, because there's a trailer

473
01:33:23,689 --> 01:33:30,100
for Saw 6 on the disc. I remember seeing it. So it assumes we've seen all five Saw movies.

474
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,739
So just want to make sure you guys are aware. There's probably going to be some spoilers,

475
01:33:32,739 --> 01:33:44,300
but Saw is one through five. I mean, I already know. Maybe you do. I don't know. Do you?

476
01:33:46,699 --> 01:33:52,539
We had Chiyo Chan give five community subs. Thank you. We also had $50 coming.

477
01:33:52,539 --> 01:33:58,789
There's 5,000 bits earlier that I missed. I'm a terrible streamer. I'm very bad at everything

478
01:33:58,789 --> 01:34:03,430
that I do. I mean, you new viewers that are here right now, I might just skip over your

479
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:06,470
$50 donation. Just want to make sure we're aware of that, apparently.

480
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:11,939
There's Green Templar. Thanks for the fucking huge amount of money.

481
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:16,810
They say, Jeremy, I want to say thank you for the entertainment you've given me. You're so

482
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:21,109
unique and have... Oh, look at that. I'm fucking unique. Really innovated the streaming formula

483
01:34:21,109 --> 01:34:26,060
with your comedy and your creative use of the tools available to you. I do have one request,

484
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:29,500
though, if you can. I really like when you play strategy games and really recommend you play

485
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:35,750
Total Warhammer 2 as the rats. It fits your theme, and I think it would be fun for a stream. Stay

486
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:43,460
safe. I think I've completely given up on ever doing anything that has to do with managing

487
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:49,300
2,000 units over the course of a giant map that I have to feed units into diplomacy and shit. I

488
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:53,220
don't think I'll ever do it again. I had an absolute mess of a time trying to play something

489
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:57,460
like Mountain Blade, and then people were like, hey, you should try Crusader Kings. And I'm like,

490
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:09,289
nope. Is this like Crusader's Kings? Shove? What the fuck? It's different.

491
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:12,939
I don't want to watch this fucking show.

492
01:35:31,529 --> 01:35:45,539
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm coming.

493
01:36:12,619 --> 01:36:20,949
How am I going to get injected? Oh, shit.

494
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:59,050
All right. Antidote. Hey, just breathe in the antidote. Okay. Antidote going in. Toxin

495
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:11,079
being released. Antidote. Antidote go that way. And then antidote. All right. Antidote going in.

496
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:27,109
Bingo. Did I win? I just made us way more powerful. Look at that heartbeat now.

497
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:41,350
We have the heartbeat of a small fish. All right. Antidote. Toxin. Yeah, get the toxin out of here.

498
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:48,039
We don't dump that that way. I'm going to give you more of that toxin. Wait, and then put the

499
01:37:48,039 --> 01:37:55,210
antidote over here. Look, Jigsaw, you didn't really explain the rules very well. Antidote.

500
01:37:56,300 --> 01:38:34,380
Okay, I think we're safe now. I'm still alive. Just match the color. What do you mean match the color?

501
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:43,239
Sorry, I was talking. I was talking over the cutscene. Is he going to explain it again?

502
01:38:52,250 --> 01:39:00,630
Red, left, blue, right. I wasn't paying any attention at all. Like zero. I was looking

503
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:28,729
at chat and like talking about stuff. Red, left, blue, right. He literally said it.

504
01:39:34,819 --> 01:39:46,100
He literally said it. Red, left, blue, right. All right. What's coming up first? I didn't, I

505
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:55,739
wanted to put it to the left. I wasn't trying to make it go right. Red, left. Okay. Blue, right.

506
01:39:56,300 --> 01:40:16,789
Okay. Red, left. This is fucking, um, it, it's just, I'm trying. No, why is it doing,

507
01:40:16,789 --> 01:40:28,600
I'm trying to go the other way. I'm, it's just putting them down auto, free stuff, fucking thing.

508
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:33,640
You made the blue go, I didn't do anything. It's just automatically doing the, can I move the device?

509
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:46,949
Okay. Blue goes right. So I'm going to do, it's going to go, go, go, go, go. So we're going to go,

510
01:40:47,670 --> 01:41:04,119
let's go put it down there. You're thinking too far ahead. Jigsaw, your puzzle's dumb.

511
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I can, what, I can't, I just like dig my hands through like my Play-Doh insides to find the

512
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:24,630
fucking device. Why do we have to do this? I don't want to do this. Okay. Now blue. Okay. Red. Red.

513
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:51,350
No, blue. Blue. Okay. Now blue. Now red. Blue. Okay. Now blue again. Blue. Oh shit. Hold on.

514
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:59,850
It's just as stupid as just, just alternate them every time. Am I overthinking this like crazy

515
01:41:59,850 --> 01:42:13,699
right now? Is it just alternate every time? And that's it. What's the point I have what,

516
01:42:13,699 --> 01:42:30,539
why have a puzzle? No, it's not. That's, that's not that simple. Is it? Oh my God. It's actually

517
01:42:30,539 --> 01:42:35,189
that simple. Okay. Now we go. No, it's not. It's not that simple. The fucking things moved. Fuck.

518
01:42:35,829 --> 01:42:45,189
Are we going to go blue? Okay. Now we're going to go, um, blue again. No, no. What happened? What the

519
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:57,430
fuck is happening right now? What? Oh boy. This is, it's storing. She's dead. Oh fuck. This is bad.

520
01:42:57,430 --> 01:43:00,630
I don't know. Uh, I'm just going to wait till you guys tell me what to do. I'm not even kidding.

521
01:43:00,630 --> 01:43:04,859
What do I do? I'm not even going to press any buttons until you say whatever it is.

522
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:18,039
Okay. Uh, now what? Red. Which one? Blue. Blue again. Red. You fucking assholes. You lied to me.

523
01:43:18,039 --> 01:43:31,350
She's dead. Do it again. Oh my God. This just sucks. This actually sucks. I don't want to do

524
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:36,149
this. I'm going to only listen to you. All right. Is there a, is there a mod in the chat right now?

525
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:43,399
Is there a mod in the chat? Uh, I'm going to only, I want one mod to tell me how to beat this.

526
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:54,460
Okay. It's just alternate only. So it's just blue, red, blue, red, blue, red, blue.

527
01:43:55,260 --> 01:44:38,869
Just go. Let me have to start storing them in shit. No mods. Uh oh. Uh oh. Okay. So, um, here we go.

528
01:44:49,779 --> 01:45:03,800
Blue. Blue first. And then now it's going to be, uh, blue again, right? Can I pause it? Okay. If

529
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:11,130
the game's stupid, I can pause it. Now it's red. Okay. Now we've got a double scenario here. We now

530
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:22,600
we do blue twice. Blue twice. Blue twice. Blue twice. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Red.

531
01:45:29,159 --> 01:45:44,100
Then red again. No, blue. No, no. Blue again. Blue. Blue here. Okay. Now red. Okay. Now,

532
01:45:45,420 --> 01:46:14,520
um, now blue. Okay. Now red. Okay. Now blue. Okay. Now red. Okay. Now blue. Okay. Now red.

533
01:46:15,159 --> 01:46:27,689
Okay. Now blue. It was just the same thing. I overthought the fuck out of that.

534
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:38,060
That was the most overthinking ever. It's okay. You're okay. What did you do? I'm not him. I'm not

535
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:47,619
the one who. It's okay. I'm okay. I know. Look, we have to play by his rules. I saw him. I saw him.

536
01:46:48,180 --> 01:46:53,140
Who is he? What did he look like? That's all you care about. I just nearly died.

537
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:56,180
Me too. We're all here because of you, detective.

538
01:47:00,439 --> 01:47:10,569
Ooh. Damaged goods. Chapter one complete. I thought this had eat light source. Why?

539
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:25,319
I'm here. I already remember. I made it through one of his tests before right now. We have to be

540
01:47:25,319 --> 01:47:29,819
careful. Doors aren't what they seem. I can't wait till she walks through one of these and

541
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:37,109
gets killed. I have a feeling this entire asylum is trapped. Play by the rules and we both might

542
01:47:37,109 --> 01:47:44,970
make it. He's watching. Already survived one trap by him. How clearly I failed the test.

543
01:47:45,689 --> 01:47:50,260
That's why he brought me back here and with a fucking cop. No less. Just be sure of this.

544
01:47:50,819 --> 01:48:06,739
Jigsaw's in control. Not you. Okay. Knock it off. Okay. I just needed to know if you could.

545
01:48:07,779 --> 01:48:19,560
She died? You don't. Can I kill her? Oh, he's in control, huh? Knock it off. Oh,

546
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:48,500
nothing in there. I am in control. Oh, I found a clue over here. Can I do anything with this?

547
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:58,520
I got back up. Back up. Back the fuck up. I got a lighter. You're wasting durability. Yeah,

548
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:44,649
you're right. Alright, Jigsaw, open the door. A little too long wind in here. Let's go. Wait.

549
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:59,270
Help. I'm coming. I'm here. You're still with me, right? Okay. Nothing in that work table.

550
01:49:59,909 --> 01:50:05,850
Pick up. What is it? A mop handle. Oh, absolutely. Here. I'll trade.

551
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:29,000
Oh, be careful. Hey, you think the man you killed cried for help the same way as he lay dying in

552
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:38,890
the street. What was he on? You covered it up, but like anything buried inside you. This really

553
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:55,939
could be Kylo Ren. Everyone you love. It's like the same lines. I give her a weapon. I really mean

554
01:50:55,939 --> 01:51:08,420
this. I can't give you anything. Why can't I give you something? I hope he says the word

555
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:29,619
unit. Look out behind you. He's electrocuting her. Okay. Well, I'm glad I don't have to worry

556
01:51:29,619 --> 01:51:35,689
about another person. I would have been a pain in the ass. Has there been anything in any of

557
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:38,890
these draws ever the whole time we played? What's the point of this stuff? It's here.

558
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:57,619
Here. All right. Stay calm. Friend or enemy. I don't know. We didn't have a chance to

559
01:51:58,180 --> 01:52:03,779
determine who that was. All right. Watch out. This is a tank that

560
01:52:06,579 --> 01:52:15,579
find the boiler room key. Go in the acid. Uh-oh. No, I don't want to just reach in the acid.

561
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:23,050
Why did I do this? Why did I do that? There's nothing in here. Oh,

562
01:52:39,449 --> 01:52:54,039
wait, I open this to live or die, live or die, live or die. Find the, find the, find the,

563
01:52:54,039 --> 01:52:57,479
find the, find the truth. Find the truth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth.

564
01:52:58,279 --> 01:53:19,720
Find the remix. What does that mean? Body bag, shotgun shell, and tripwire.

565
01:53:20,439 --> 01:53:28,569
Oh, I get a shotgun. I get a gun. I hope I get a gun. Even walking can be dangerous in Jigsaw's

566
01:53:28,569 --> 01:53:32,890
world. Watch the ground for shotgun tripwires and disable them before they go off. You can also

567
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:37,899
rearm these to use against enemies. Oh, that's right here. Okay. Well, how do I turn it off?

568
01:53:38,699 --> 01:53:58,710
Buddy, how do I turn it off? So, all right, now arm it. Wait, now arm it while I'm across it.

569
01:54:02,939 --> 01:54:13,720
Okay. I'm going to forget that that's there, but try to remind me. I almost blew my fucking head off.

570
01:54:19,979 --> 01:54:33,319
That was, that was close. I'm not going to lie. See the janitor about the steam. I need a wheel.

571
01:54:37,939 --> 01:54:55,270
Why? What's the thing with steam hurting you and killing you and stuff? Are you telling me

572
01:54:55,270 --> 01:55:00,630
that you can't just like full sprint and like slide underneath that? Just take your shirt and

573
01:55:00,630 --> 01:55:07,239
like cover your head and stuff and just run, sprint, slide. It's hot. Yeah. Slide on and just,

574
01:55:07,239 --> 01:55:20,060
just sprint as fast as you can. You'll get like a little bit on you. It sticks to you.

575
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:27,369
You know, the one of the seals broke today near the boiler. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

576
01:55:27,369 --> 01:55:33,579
Treasure. Next time. Seal breaks might kill someone. Yeah. Well, you didn't tell me where

577
01:55:33,579 --> 01:55:46,119
the wheel was. Uh, is this the game's excuse to just get you? I don't understand why I keep doing

578
01:55:46,119 --> 01:56:18,789
it. I feel like that's the game telling me I was out of bounds for too long. What? Escape the bathroom.

579
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:37,369
Uh, what are the rules? What's the rule book? Darkness illuminates. All right. Put down the

580
01:56:37,369 --> 01:56:48,550
darkness illuminates. Uh huh. All right. Turn the light off. Light switch. Be in this toilet over

581
01:56:48,550 --> 01:57:07,529
here. Get all these needles. I got the key. Is that a key to the helmet?

582
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:22,810
Okay. Rescue. Go to the janitor's office. Okay. And his office is this way. Where's that bomb?

583
01:57:23,529 --> 01:57:28,340
Where's that? Where's that tripwire? It's over here, right? That's not, where is it?

584
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:46,729
Is it right here? Where's that tripwire? I don't know where it is. Your shotgun collar reacts to

585
01:57:46,729 --> 01:57:51,779
specific enemies with shotgun collars. When you get near one of these enemies, the lights on the

586
01:57:51,779 --> 01:57:56,420
back of your collar will blink. The closer the enemy, the closer the enemy, the faster the

587
01:57:56,420 --> 01:58:02,539
blinking and the faster your own collar will detonate. Try to stay far away from enemies with

588
01:58:02,539 --> 01:58:06,779
collars. If you keep your distance long enough, the enemy collar will explode and deactivate.

589
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:17,340
Ah, don't come near me, man. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away. Get away. Don't you know

590
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:26,100
what these things are? You fucking idiot. Stop. Leave me alone. Hold the door. All right. You're

591
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:50,329
fucked. Dead. Wait, but his collar is still on the ground. Where is he? I got his, wait, oh,

592
01:58:50,329 --> 01:59:16,899
there he is. I was gonna say this is his arm. Oh, this is where he explains it. Okay. Pick this

593
01:59:16,899 --> 01:59:36,460
lock. Oh crap. I can't do that. What's he doing? I want to select this one. The number is Jeremy.

594
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:48,220
What do they mean? I don't know. This is shit. Unlock. Jigsaw chest. Gear. A nail. What's in

595
01:59:48,220 --> 02:00:32,010
the jigsaw chest? Oh boy. Wait, I have to, I didn't know there were other sizes. All right,

596
02:00:32,010 --> 02:01:33,180
there's this huge, come on. How far on do I have to go? Got it. Doctor, his brain's too big.

597
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:46,329
Shotgun shell trip where I end bandages. Excellent. Oh, got it. Now we've got to go

598
02:01:50,579 --> 02:02:02,229
over, we have to go the way that guy came. Bathed up over here. Probably a dead body in it.

599
02:02:02,949 --> 02:02:09,180
Search the area to find the valve wheel. Oh, no, I want to press his hand. Way cooler.

600
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:26,979
Storage. Oh, the baseball bat in here. What do I care? I don't care. Nothing. I break this wall.

601
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:37,029
No. Need a hand, Jeremy. And then why didn't you do the Pepe laugh thing?

602
02:02:37,909 --> 02:02:43,210
How would you write that and not write Pepe laugh? Have you ever been on the internet before? Come

603
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:53,859
on. The wheel is nearby. It's probably right behind this. Behind the chalkboard.

604
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:10,069
Wow. I almost just walked right into that. Okay. That would have been bad. I'm knocking. I can't

605
02:03:10,069 --> 02:03:23,750
see that shit. How am I supposed to reliably see those? Oh, there it is. Nothing. Wait,

606
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:32,340
what was in there? I don't know. Rip wire. Okay. That's the point. Oh, no one's even hurt me.

607
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:52,810
I'm untouchable. Yeah, I gotta get this open into the utility room. What the hell did that just say?

608
02:03:53,770 --> 02:03:59,510
What did that just say? What did that just say? That was a huge amount of text. What did it say?

609
02:04:03,399 --> 02:04:23,659
Oh, I think that guy died. Well, what is this? Probably said don't touch electricity. Table lamp.

610
02:04:24,949 --> 02:04:33,109
No, I want the, I want the wooden leg. Uh, they call these people insane, but I don't see that.

611
02:04:33,109 --> 02:04:43,189
Somebody else will read this screenshot and look at it. This is the guy they told us about.

612
02:04:55,829 --> 02:05:22,890
There you are. Where am I? Who are you? Who is, who is me? Step on, come over here.

613
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:45,859
Do you see it? He sees it. What the fuck? He doesn't see it. Does he? I crit this guy. Nice.

614
02:05:45,859 --> 02:05:56,149
Nice. All right. How do I get this guy to come over here? Come over here. Hey, this way.

615
02:06:03,430 --> 02:06:25,300
Where is he? Where is he? Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Okay. Hold on. Here we go. Oh my God.

616
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:35,880
That was fucking horrible. Well, I got him. Turn that off. Don't die. This, uh, I think there was

617
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:43,020
another wire here or a shell that I couldn't get before because I had full inventory. I like it

618
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:56,859
matters. Oh, it don't fucking hurt. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Full nails. All right. Now back to

619
02:06:56,859 --> 02:07:03,510
that door. Table lamp hog. Yeah. It's time to pick up the table lamp. You're right.

620
02:07:06,810 --> 02:07:22,170
Oh, nothing. Wait, nothing. Why are they still lit up? What is this? Okay. Now I get the hell

621
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:37,579
out of here. I go, um, uh, this way. Wait, what did he have? Oh, he's a mop handle. I got the wheel

622
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:46,789
back to the steam room, which was down and just making sure he didn't stand up.

623
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:58,329
This guy got out. How did this guy get out of this chamber?

624
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:13,539
I keep getting achievements. Wait, is that thing going to explode?

625
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:27,659
Okay. That was, wait, I think I ran out of material. He's really dead. Yeah. He's very dead.

626
02:08:28,460 --> 02:08:58,020
Okay. Steam room this way. There's electricity everywhere over here. What room am I even in?

627
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:12,649
What is this place? I turned it off. I just found like a new area. Diffuse.

628
02:09:13,449 --> 02:09:21,560
Take it. Joe Biden game play. I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.

629
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:46,409
What is, how is that? What do you mean true? I I'm just like progressing through the game.

630
02:09:46,409 --> 02:09:57,210
What are you talking about? Please read. Hold on. It was an important please read comment.

631
02:09:58,659 --> 02:10:01,859
Please read. There's no risk in this game because you aren't actually in danger. If you fail one of

632
02:10:01,859 --> 02:10:06,100
Jigsaw's games, you die. You should have to snap a rubber band against your wrist or pop a balloon

633
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:20,939
next to your ear. Why? I don't want to do that. Oh, fuck that. I'm not popping balloons next to my

634
02:10:20,939 --> 02:10:34,949
head. All right. Where's the steam room? Fuck balloons. That hurt? Why did that hurt so bad?

635
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:51,260
Wait, where am I? Furnace. Spoiler room. No escape. No escape. It felt like 20 feet.

636
02:10:51,899 --> 02:11:06,979
It did not fall that far. Use an Estus. Good. Okay. Not what?

637
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:20,020
Okay. I don't have a wire. What do I do? I don't have a wire. There's no wire. I don't have a wire.

638
02:11:20,659 --> 02:11:41,319
Got one. Okay. 40 seconds. Uh oh. What was the point of, what was the point of me doing that?

639
02:11:50,380 --> 02:12:08,310
Go, go, go, go, go, go. How much time? Good. Oh, the acid. Remember? Okay. Furnace. Spoiler room.

640
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:27,479
We just can't, what? The trip wire. Trip wire from like 30 minutes ago. Whatever.

641
02:12:34,869 --> 02:12:41,109
Be fair though with me. That was a while ago. And where the fuck even is that? Okay. On your,

642
02:12:41,109 --> 02:12:45,180
do you see it on your screen? I don't. Like, I don't even know where it is now.

643
02:12:45,899 --> 02:12:56,649
It's right there. Okay. That shit wasn't even on the screen. Let's turn the fuck up.

644
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:16,340
Turn it back on. Turn it back on. Turn the steam back on. Turn the steam back on then.

645
02:13:16,979 --> 02:13:26,619
Turn the steam back on. If that's the problem. Turn the steam back on. Can I check this body?

646
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:50,100
Oh shit. They're killing each other in there. Not much chance. All right. I'm going to wait

647
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:52,739
till he puts his face right here and I'm going to hit him right the fucking teeth through the door.

648
02:13:52,739 --> 02:14:08,760
Is he eating him? Hey. Hey. Hey, you. I'm talking to you. Can I climb through? Can I get in here?

649
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:22,229
It's open. Can he throw grenades? Dude, I wish you could just whip shit. I would just throw this

650
02:14:22,229 --> 02:14:29,819
at this guy's head. Okay. Well, whatever. Let's go and go up. Can't go that way because the steam

651
02:14:29,819 --> 02:14:36,359
is there. He's eating. Well, whatever. I'll take, I'll take him. I'll just wait till I do a drop

652
02:14:36,359 --> 02:15:07,819
down R1. I'd like you, Jerma. Thanks. What happened in there? I don't deserve this. Oh fuck. Steam.

653
02:15:08,779 --> 02:15:15,260
Wait, is that like a fake steam? What the hell was that? How did that just pop up for a second?

654
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:28,060
All right. There he is. Right? He's right here. The guy's in here. Let's go. I have the high ground.

655
02:15:35,619 --> 02:15:52,149
He's got a knife. No. No. Fuck you. Get away from me. Plunging attack.

656
02:15:56,939 --> 02:16:23,560
It didn't work. Throw the steam on. Quick. Burn him. He dropped the knife. Wait. Why? Kill him.

657
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:37,059
Is he dead? Okay. He's dead. I want his knife. Where's that knife? The knife fell down here.

658
02:16:42,389 --> 02:17:00,360
Give me that knife. It's right there. I want that fucking knife. Game sucks. Whatever. Say please.

659
02:17:01,239 --> 02:17:05,379
This is, this is a real Halloween stream kind of game. Don't you think?

660
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:21,559
I bet it's late. All right. I made it. Like rats in a maze. Oh, this is going to be fucking

661
02:17:21,559 --> 02:17:28,360
fantastic. Isn't it? I can't wait. Please give me a checkpoint because this is going to,

662
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:49,850
I know this is going to be horrendous. Uh, I have a weapon. I got a gear. So, all right. Turn this

663
02:17:49,850 --> 02:17:59,159
off. What does this make it go? All right. Makes it go this way. I got to follow the rules.

664
02:17:59,399 --> 02:18:19,690
Follow the rules or die. Skip lore. Okay. Then over here. And now what? How do I,

665
02:18:19,690 --> 02:18:29,079
how the fuck do I get that turned off? Run through it. I don't think I can. I think it's going to

666
02:18:29,079 --> 02:18:50,010
kill me. Oh, this is go down. 5,000 bits and a 50 fucking dollars came in from fat Batman.

667
02:18:51,059 --> 02:18:56,260
Like that name. Thanks for the 50 bucks. They say, Hey, he said my message chat. So he knows

668
02:18:56,260 --> 02:19:19,690
I like him more. He said my message. So he likes me more. Uh, well, I mean, everybody eventually

669
02:19:19,690 --> 02:19:34,649
is going to be a one guy. You know that didn't say no. It just did. Where's your only fans.

670
02:19:35,370 --> 02:19:41,260
We already went over that. That's not, I don't have that. What lies beneath. Okay. But hold on.

671
02:19:42,139 --> 02:19:48,809
What's this thing? I don't know. Let's find out how far of a drop is it?

672
02:19:52,659 --> 02:20:00,389
Whatever. All right. Let's dumb ass mazes. More dumb ass dialogue, please. Come on.

673
02:20:00,389 --> 02:20:20,469
There's something to work with. It feels bad, man. It's a 2.6 maze that is that you make up

674
02:20:20,469 --> 02:20:54,420
on my, my college GPA. What was your college GPA? Uh, I don't want to do this. I don't want to do

675
02:20:54,420 --> 02:21:52,040
this. I'm done. This is a 2.7 puzzle. Shut up. No, wait, no, no, no. Go back to that.

676
02:21:52,040 --> 02:22:03,459
Two point fucking seven GPA puzzle. Got it. What I can say. I didn't do it. No.

677
02:22:03,459 --> 02:22:18,790
All right. Here they come. They're going to be running through the ballroom or the,

678
02:22:18,790 --> 02:22:25,930
wait, I hear them starting and stopping. No, why is that? I need a checkpoint.

679
02:22:25,930 --> 02:22:34,459
I'm not doing this yet. This is, I'm going to die. Super Mario level bullshit. No. Okay. So go.

680
02:22:41,020 --> 02:23:05,139
Wait for me. This game is fucked. I know. Wicked fuck. You have made it into the heart of the

681
02:23:05,139 --> 02:23:19,479
boiler. Throwing punches. Throwing punches. Why don't you say help me? Anyone out there? Help me.

682
02:23:19,479 --> 02:23:27,110
Fucking punch you in the face. Somebody help me. I'm thick on my head. Minecraft Steve.

683
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:38,059
Bricks. Oh yes. Again, I gave us bricks in it. Oh, this became one of the best games ever.

684
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:44,360
This game has bricks in it. Thank God there's fucking bricks in this game.

685
02:23:46,250 --> 02:24:04,680
Can't see. Oh, this guy's doing this. Holy shit.

686
02:24:15,479 --> 02:24:28,889
Oh, that was so dumb. I have to do this shit again. Whatever. Hey, go away. One go one in one go,

687
02:24:28,889 --> 02:24:35,559
please. Oh, good. It hit me. But who cares? How would that guy be able to see? He's chasing me

688
02:24:35,559 --> 02:25:09,510
around. Come on, man. How hard is this? Oh, my chest. How would he not get shot by these?

689
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:41,110
Oh, don't shoot. I didn't know there were two shotgun trips. Oh, God damn it. Chest.

690
02:25:42,709 --> 02:25:55,129
You got baked to death. Kind of. All right. In one go. Right. I can do it in one go just to prove I

691
02:25:55,129 --> 02:26:02,219
can. Oh, it's tricky. But all right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here

692
02:26:02,219 --> 02:26:10,299
he comes. Okay. Help. Yep. Okay. Where's the tripwire? Right here. Just arm it. Give me a brick.

693
02:26:11,819 --> 02:26:47,819
All right. Now arm it. Come on. What? He punched me. Give me the brick. Brick.

694
02:26:47,819 --> 02:27:15,350
Okay. Help him. I can't help him. Wait. Where is he? Where the fuck did he go?

695
02:27:16,649 --> 02:27:29,719
Where is this guy? Where'd he go? Where is he? Hello? Why is he not here anymore? Where is he?

696
02:27:36,090 --> 02:27:45,670
He tripped. Oh, he tripped this. We didn't even get to see him die. I've got to take a brick with

697
02:27:45,829 --> 02:27:58,149
all this important. Holy fuck. I almost walked over that. Okay, we're good. That's all the traps.

698
02:27:58,149 --> 02:28:20,920
I got the valve. Yep. Might as well take them all. Oh, please get out of here. What the fuck? All

699
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:28,069
right. Which one is it going to go into? I don't know. This one, I guess. Okay. Then down here.

700
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:36,229
No, it can be this thing and like this thing. Then wait, I got to connect this bullshit. Okay.

701
02:28:36,229 --> 02:28:46,860
Hold on. No, no. There it is. Okay. I'll connect this shit. No, this way. Okay. Now get this. This

702
02:28:46,860 --> 02:29:09,719
connected. Connected, I guess. I don't even know where it's supposed to be going. I hate this thing.

703
02:29:10,840 --> 02:30:02,100
No, I want to... I got to connect these stupid fucking valves, but it's like,

704
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:07,670
which one is the right one? I don't know. It's wild guess time. It's not this one. Not that one.

705
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:39,540
Not this one. Not this one either. Not this one. It's this one. It has to be. It's right here.

706
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:49,879
Yeah. All right. That's stupid. Who made this dump? Why would you make it like this? All right. Give

707
02:30:49,879 --> 02:31:10,950
me it. Give me it. Give me the key. Give me the key. Open the boiler. What? Open it. Didn't it just

708
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:25,420
say get the key from the boiler? Behind the boiler. What the hell did it even just say?

709
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:53,180
Okay. I like the furnace gate key. Is this a map in this game? That shotgun's freaking me the fuck

710
02:31:53,180 --> 02:32:07,100
out. All right. Am I insane or did I get the key? Do I just keep going? I already got the key.

711
02:32:07,819 --> 02:32:18,969
The way the fuck was the damn thing? Check my inventory. I don't even know how to do that.

712
02:32:23,739 --> 02:32:38,180
It's in your body now. Oh, I don't know what I just did. Okay. All right. Well, what the hell

713
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:51,459
does it want me to do now? Objective. Behind me. Turning into Adam Sandler. What a stupid map.

714
02:32:53,219 --> 02:33:01,000
I can't have an arrow pointing. Why does it have to be a star? Is this it? Why is it? Wait.

715
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,760
Why would I do the... What's the point of doing the furnace puzzle if this is just here?

716
02:33:06,389 --> 02:33:18,860
What? God. Don't. Please give me a checkpoint. Please. Checkpoint. Please.

717
02:33:18,860 --> 02:33:34,870
Please. Oh, I got to get out of here. Can I walk past this? I guess so. I don't know.

718
02:33:35,909 --> 02:33:47,610
No, I got to go out here. Oh, please. Steam coming out. Can I go? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

719
02:33:50,409 --> 02:34:04,840
Okay. Fine. Nice fucking YouTuber reaction there. I would say so. Okay. Now go right and then straight

720
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:17,610
and then hell. Okay. Am I going to get hit by this? Is that steam? I don't know what that is.

721
02:34:18,409 --> 02:34:34,629
Is that steam? Is that going to kill me? I don't want to walk fucking by it. It's going to hit me.

722
02:34:35,430 --> 02:35:03,850
Okay. Now we're going to go left. Okay. Got it. And then this way. I made it. I went sick.

723
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:07,479
Looks like you were quick enough to save yourself, but

724
02:35:08,120 --> 02:35:11,799
thinking about yourself is what you excel at. Unlock the furnace room.

725
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:22,469
I got a checkpoint there. That's pretty good. Thank God. Let's get locked in. Of course I didn't.

726
02:35:22,469 --> 02:35:37,510
All right. You have anything else for me? Here we go. Rescue Jennings Foster. Locate the furnace

727
02:35:37,510 --> 02:35:47,159
room. Give me that pipe. Protect myself. Bolt this door. Can I? Or you'll end up reading this

728
02:35:47,159 --> 02:36:00,649
eventually. Maybe. Wait, there's a syringe. I can syringe people. This is pretty awesome actually.

729
02:36:00,649 --> 02:36:16,120
Okay. I'm keeping the syringe case file. Uh, you'll, if you pause the stream and just rewind,

730
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:45,959
you'll, you can read it. I'm going to try to steam clean this something. Okay. The lock. I

731
02:36:45,959 --> 02:36:52,200
got to go, but love your term up. Have a good one. Good to see you again. Make sure you join

732
02:36:52,200 --> 02:37:12,420
us next time. There's nothing even in here. What a waste of, waste of time. Waste of time.

733
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:17,540
Million viewers are gone. Can't be real. There's not a million people, uh, on Twitch.

734
02:37:18,180 --> 02:37:30,149
Take the case file. Somebody else will read it. Where am I going now? All right. I need to go.

735
02:37:31,909 --> 02:37:48,329
Where am I? I'm not even on the map. Here I am. There I am. Okay. Here we go. Step on glass. Use

736
02:37:48,329 --> 02:38:19,379
them. Okay. Not bad. Not bad for my first day. Got a gun. I don't want to syringe you, but I will.

737
02:38:22,440 --> 02:38:30,629
What's on his head? Why does he have like a little canister on his head? Is the guy going to explode?

738
02:38:30,629 --> 02:38:50,329
Don't do it. Is he? I'm safe. Okay. What does it do? Oh, it closed on his head. Run. Run.

739
02:38:51,719 --> 02:38:56,020
That was actually horrible. I can't believe I just got through that. All right.

740
02:38:56,979 --> 02:39:01,579
Watch the glass, man. I wasn't looking up in the shock and going off in my face.

741
02:39:02,790 --> 02:39:15,879
That's some fucking Tom and Jerry shit right there. Oh, let's see if I can get this.

742
02:39:18,309 --> 02:39:29,430
And do a Tom and Jerry bit. First aid cabinet. I've so, I don't even need any items.

743
02:39:30,229 --> 02:39:48,780
What's the point of me doing this? Three drugs, I guess. Bat. Do I still have syringe? No.

744
02:39:48,780 --> 02:40:08,649
One time use. Okay. Furnace room this way. And here we go. What's my next goal? TV. That will

745
02:40:08,649 --> 02:40:31,819
tell me that's not telling me anything. No tripwire, right?

746
02:40:49,659 --> 02:40:54,579
What's he doing to this guy? Is he going to squish him? Okay. Here's what I think. If I'm

747
02:40:54,579 --> 02:40:59,860
a diabolical sick fuck, he's on a plate and he's going to just on a piston, he's going to squish

748
02:40:59,860 --> 02:41:04,659
him up into the ceiling like he's a fly with a fly's water, right? It's going to slowly go up

749
02:41:04,659 --> 02:41:07,459
and it's going to scare the shit out of him. It's going to go really fast and stop and it's going

750
02:41:07,459 --> 02:41:11,780
to, no, I'm not going to really, really slow, but we can fast to the ceiling. No, here we go.

751
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:15,459
I'm going to pull you back down all the way and you can, we'll sit there for like another 40

752
02:41:15,459 --> 02:41:29,739
minutes or so. This is fucked up. This is weird that I'm saying this. This game suck. Oh, a camera.

753
02:41:32,139 --> 02:41:40,629
Wait, don't, why would you do that into your own eyes? Picture is worth a thousand words.

754
02:41:41,430 --> 02:42:01,159
The picture is, what does it say? I don't like that. Find the truth. It's a pharmaceutical company

755
02:42:01,159 --> 02:42:12,379
that's going to blot you evil shit or something. No, this is, I don't like that. This sucks. Give

756
02:42:12,379 --> 02:42:15,659
me the lighter instead. I'm going to need this though, aren't I? But I don't know what that means.

757
02:42:16,540 --> 02:42:43,340
Am I missing something? What the fuck is that? That's very disorienting. Yeah, it is. Push and

758
02:42:43,340 --> 02:42:54,860
pull your way forward. I need to even look at that. I can read backwards. Can you use the lighter?

759
02:42:54,860 --> 02:43:00,389
Please God. I'm going to need this. I'll get another lighter. Don't worry. Push and pull your

760
02:43:00,389 --> 02:43:18,600
way forward. I'm with the pig thing. Push and pull. Zet-y. Puppet. I puppet. What does it say?

761
02:43:19,399 --> 02:43:32,950
All right, let's go. I'm going to pull this. What does it say? Cart. Yeah, I can't pull it or push

762
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:53,930
it. Push or pull your way to, I don't know. Wait, was it one of the, more than two? There's a few

763
02:43:53,930 --> 02:44:14,180
of these. Oh, here we go. Oh, it's going to be like that traffic game. That was thankfully easy.

764
02:44:14,819 --> 02:44:21,989
I'm just walking around up there. I'm going to run right for the camera right in the face.

765
02:44:31,219 --> 02:44:54,489
Well, everybody coming? Hold it from the other side. That's going to happen. Every,

766
02:44:58,790 --> 02:45:10,360
so glad there's an actual checkpoint here. Okay. It's so dark. I, even with the,

767
02:45:10,360 --> 02:45:13,000
with the flash I wouldn't have been able to see this shit. Where is it? Right there.

768
02:45:13,799 --> 02:45:24,409
There's another one. Is it set? Wait, set it. Okay. Set that one. Then I'm going to,

769
02:45:24,409 --> 02:45:27,129
there's going to be a guy that breaks through and I'm going to run around the circle. There he is.

770
02:45:27,850 --> 02:45:46,540
It's the psycho right there. Oh yeah. The door is open. Only one door open. Follow me. Wait,

771
02:45:46,540 --> 02:45:55,510
he didn't even get hit by the mung that I put. He did. Wait, I have one minute to do this.

772
02:45:56,309 --> 02:46:05,500
How do I get this guy to come out? 56 seconds. Wait, why does this guy have like a VR helmet on?

773
02:46:06,219 --> 02:46:30,860
We have both so bad. It's like a JRPG. Miss fucking kidding me. Your time is up.

774
02:46:33,659 --> 02:46:47,000
You'll see. Okay. Give me, wait, he's not dead. I think I got him. I think I got him. All right.

775
02:46:47,000 --> 02:47:01,559
How do I, how do I get this guy out? Eight seconds until what? Eight seconds. Wait until he's

776
02:47:01,559 --> 02:47:20,739
released. So what? This guy's like worse for wear than everybody else was. This is going to do

777
02:47:20,739 --> 02:47:45,829
anything. Okay. I got the furnace for him. Okay. What? It's all right.

778
02:47:48,229 --> 02:47:53,590
You aren't, I was, I was, uh, yeah. Fuck. I know I can't, there's nothing I can say about that one.

779
02:47:53,590 --> 02:47:57,510
I mean, holy shit, dude, was that on purpose? No. I mean, I was trying to,

780
02:47:58,649 --> 02:48:04,659
I was trying to say that thought it was a on, and I thought it was a on like this,

781
02:48:04,659 --> 02:48:18,219
on like a cabinet or something. I don't know. I'm stupid. Talk to me. God damn it. I'm yeah.

782
02:48:18,219 --> 02:48:33,420
Why am I just silent? Why wouldn't we want to work together? Oh no. One minute. Whatever will we do?

783
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:42,899
Can we fight through the door? I can't hit him through the door.

784
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:54,540
Where's the other guy? Oh, he's waiting. Fucking right next to you, dude.

785
02:49:01,579 --> 02:49:09,079
Open the door. Okay. I'm going to be ready right when the door opens.

786
02:49:09,719 --> 02:50:02,170
The timer up. Oh, it is now. I hit him right in the groin. Okay. Don't fuck around, dude.

787
02:50:02,170 --> 02:50:05,610
Why is he taking a full step forward? Just wait. You see what I'm doing? I'm hitting A.

788
02:50:09,270 --> 02:50:19,879
Jesus Christ. I hit him. I'm you. Okay. Hey, he does like this full step forward. I'm not

789
02:50:19,879 --> 02:50:35,639
having him do that. Unlock the furnace room. Wait, don't fucking go fast. See right here.

790
02:50:35,639 --> 02:50:42,860
This is what happened last time. I went to open this. See, it's like, hey, you can touch this.

791
02:50:43,420 --> 02:50:50,469
That's what happened. See what I'm talking about here. Look at that bullshit. I thought I was

792
02:50:50,469 --> 02:51:02,709
fucking mad. I'm back to normal. Now we're going to open the furnace door, the mannequin arm,

793
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:09,180
furnace door. Whoa, wait, check, check, check, check. Always check, check, check, check, check,

794
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:17,000
check, check. Fucking can't even play this game. I'm fucking about to just rage quit and leave.

795
02:51:18,680 --> 02:51:42,629
Fucking come on. No. I have to do it again. Oh, just have you both come out already.

796
02:51:46,280 --> 02:51:52,090
Okay. Look out. Oh no. Watch out. There's a bomb over here. Oh shit. What's that?

797
02:51:57,610 --> 02:52:09,190
Come here. Guys, I can't. What? Okay. I'm going to. Okay.

798
02:52:17,270 --> 02:52:21,430
Why would you put that in this game? What's the point of that? It's just there to

799
02:52:21,430 --> 02:52:30,860
be like a joke. Same one. I know. You don't think I know this? What do you think? You think I'm not

800
02:52:30,860 --> 02:52:36,840
paying attention to what's happening? I know. I get it. I'm not. I know. I'm trying to make this

801
02:52:36,840 --> 02:53:12,299
not a reality. I just. Armin again. Quick. Armin again. Armin again. You had to have seen me do

802
02:53:12,299 --> 02:53:32,229
that. Okay. We all have five IQ. 37 fucking seconds. No, please. Just end this shit. It's right here.

803
02:53:34,809 --> 02:53:59,620
2.6 IQ. Okay. Come on. Is this like for pity to make it so you don't get overwhelmed?

804
02:54:01,139 --> 02:54:33,030
You give me your pain. I was just not hurting. Okay. Okay. All right. There's no bomb or anything

805
02:54:33,030 --> 02:54:44,600
here. Open fucking door. There is nothing here that can hurt me. Nothing here can hurt me.

806
02:54:45,319 --> 02:54:52,360
Nothing here. Okay. Nothing here can hurt me. There it is. I gotta stop this thing from

807
02:54:52,920 --> 02:54:58,760
sliding down into his body. All right. It got it. I don't. I shouldn't just run up there though

808
02:54:58,760 --> 02:55:31,370
because. Well, go on. Do your intro. We're rolling. You even put an innocent man in jail for your

809
02:55:31,370 --> 02:55:38,200
crime all to preserve your perfect life. Couldn't stop the guilt from eating away at you rotting you

810
02:55:38,200 --> 02:55:47,190
from the inside. So unless the officer you involved in your crime can hold the blame.

811
02:55:47,190 --> 02:55:52,950
We will see what you really have. No, you're dead, man. You're dead. He's dead. He's not going to live.

812
02:55:52,950 --> 02:56:00,889
He's not going to live. It's through this. Jason, it's been a real pleasure being your friend.

813
02:56:02,170 --> 02:56:18,760
Oh, hurry the fuck up. Hurry the fuck up. It's a complicated thing. Stop.

814
02:56:25,020 --> 02:56:37,350
How fast do I have to do this shit? Not going to work here.

815
02:56:44,340 --> 02:57:02,520
Fucking hurry. Go. Stop. There's one. All right. It's going back up. I got it.

816
02:57:03,239 --> 02:57:23,129
Okay. Now this one. And then. Shit. Now. Just suck your stomach in. It can't be that easy. It's not

817
02:57:23,129 --> 02:57:56,899
that easy. I'm going for it, man. Just relax. Relax. There's another one. Done. Oh, this

818
02:57:56,899 --> 02:58:15,239
one's a little weird. All right. Damn it. It can't be that. It's simple. Can it? Come on. One of

819
02:58:15,239 --> 02:58:41,780
these. It's got to work. Come on. No. Get. Go up. I can't. Wait. Can I go up from like.

820
02:58:45,850 --> 02:58:50,010
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Why'd you tell

821
02:58:50,010 --> 02:59:19,239
me to do that? Okay. Now I can. Come on. Up like this and then. Reach. That doesn't reach. Why?

822
02:59:19,879 --> 02:59:33,819
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. You're fine. All right. That's it. Right.

823
02:59:33,819 --> 02:59:55,370
That's another one. Please. I got time. I'm hurrying. I'm going as fast as I can.

824
02:59:59,829 --> 03:00:35,780
No. How is that not right? Give me control back. Then stop talking. Oh. Got it. Wait. What? No,

825
03:00:35,780 --> 03:00:48,920
no, no, no, no, no, no. What am I doing? I went. I thought it was just for nothing.

826
03:00:54,569 --> 03:01:00,569
Tap. You self-righteous son of a bitch. Easy, Jennings. You're just reacting to the shock.

827
03:01:00,569 --> 03:01:10,649
Just calm down. You fuck. You fucker. You're the reason he picked me. You. Me? You killed a man.

828
03:01:10,649 --> 03:01:16,809
You a murderer. He was homeless. He didn't have a family. He meant nothing to anyone. What about

829
03:01:16,809 --> 03:01:21,770
the innocent man you put in prison? What about his family? What did you do? But he didn't have to

830
03:01:22,409 --> 03:01:23,370
put an innocent man in prison?

831
03:01:45,370 --> 03:01:45,930
Put him back.

832
03:01:52,969 --> 03:02:10,860
I don't even want him about the steam. He'll figure it out. I need some help.

833
03:02:12,379 --> 03:02:17,420
I got to get this camera out of here. The camera is the worst item in the whole game.

834
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:20,340
And here we go.

835
03:02:23,299 --> 03:02:27,450
Before you are to do or test your faith,

836
03:02:28,010 --> 03:02:38,889
continue blind with your sight intact. Make your choice quickly. When the timer reaches zero,

837
03:02:38,889 --> 03:02:52,459
the bombs located all around you will detonate. Wait, what do you mean? Here's a path. Okay, this

838
03:02:52,459 --> 03:03:41,180
one. Okay, so what? Am I supposed to not touch them? Did I just walk in a circle? Why? How are

839
03:03:41,180 --> 03:04:00,139
they going to explode? Is it upstairs? Wait. Oh, wait. What the fuck is going on? That's right.

840
03:04:00,139 --> 03:04:15,639
All right. I did it. One minute, 38 seconds left on the clock. There it is. Door sealed.

841
03:04:19,559 --> 03:04:53,530
Wait, this is the beginning. How did I pick this one? Fucking hurry. What do you mean hurry?

842
03:04:53,530 --> 03:05:08,459
This is the most disorienting thing ever. Oh, I have a map. Who cares? Just use the map.

843
03:05:09,340 --> 03:05:32,889
No, no, you're not supposed to look at your map. Can I just have my head explode and just

844
03:05:32,889 --> 03:06:01,500
pick the other door? This sucks. I'm stuck in a wall somewhere. Give me the other door. Fuck

845
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:11,350
this door. Give me the other one. Do you think when those explosions go off,

846
03:06:11,350 --> 03:06:21,479
it saws upstairs in a chair and he like rocks? He's like, whoa. Where is he? You would feel that

847
03:06:21,479 --> 03:06:26,459
everywhere in the whole fucking building. All right. I want to, let's go make your choice. Yeah.

848
03:06:26,459 --> 03:06:30,139
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't do the one with the blind one. Oh, no, we're going this one.

849
03:06:30,940 --> 03:06:39,319
Before you open your doors, each will test your faith. You continue blindly or face a greater

850
03:06:39,319 --> 03:06:46,360
challenge with your sight intact. Make your choice quickly. Hopefully it's like four enemies

851
03:06:46,360 --> 03:06:54,309
because that's not a challenge. Okay. Let's go this way. What's the greater challenge?

852
03:06:57,079 --> 03:07:10,840
Nothing can be a greater challenge than that. Oh, no. I know how much you suck at this.

853
03:07:11,799 --> 03:07:41,079
It's balanced over a board. No, I'm going to be squashed. It got me.

854
03:07:46,149 --> 03:07:51,430
Sorry. That's way better. I don't care. It's fine. It's way better than the other one.

855
03:07:51,430 --> 03:07:59,540
The other one's so bad. I wish I could skip this dialogue. Before you are two doors,

856
03:07:59,540 --> 03:08:10,739
each will test your faith. Your sight intact. This one. Make your choice quickly. When the

857
03:08:10,819 --> 03:08:19,219
timer reaches zero, the bombs located all around you will detonate. It's scary. Okay. Go.

858
03:08:20,500 --> 03:08:50,969
Hey, good. All right. Is there a place where I can stop? Oh, shit. Oh, I don't know if I'm

859
03:08:50,969 --> 03:08:59,879
in the right place. Don't wait. What the fuck? No way. What happened? Oh, come on.

860
03:09:01,590 --> 03:09:12,379
Yeah, I was just blue. I was supposed to time that one. Why did it blow up your head? I don't know.

861
03:09:14,379 --> 03:09:15,340
I leaned into it.

862
03:10:01,690 --> 03:10:17,770
Okay. Is that enough room? Don't hit my arm. Holy shit. I made it. Okay. Good.

863
03:10:18,489 --> 03:10:30,020
Now what? Wash your hands. Now what? Go over here. Nothing in here. What did I just take?

864
03:10:30,020 --> 03:10:38,899
I don't know. This game is dumb. What happened? What did I just get? My hands. What did I just

865
03:10:38,899 --> 03:11:11,530
get? I had to push. I knew what I got. Don't touch that. What? I got a coupler? Okay. Oh, yeah.

866
03:11:12,250 --> 03:11:19,059
All right. Turn it off. Oh, okay. I'm not that bad at these. I'm pretty good at these.

867
03:11:20,020 --> 03:11:38,469
There you go. Everyone's like, oh, he's going to fit. Nope. I don't know. There could be a

868
03:11:38,469 --> 03:11:44,489
fucking bomb right there. I don't know, guys. What do you want me to do? What is that? It's

869
03:11:44,489 --> 03:11:58,420
something in the... Pick up the... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where am I? Where am I going? Water bottle?

870
03:11:59,059 --> 03:12:06,459
No, I want the water bottle. How do I get the water bottle? What does the water bottle pick up?

871
03:12:08,299 --> 03:12:17,510
Okay. This is sealed. Go. I got to hurry. I know. Yeah. I'm going. There's a bomb. Find a key.

872
03:12:18,469 --> 03:12:22,940
Find a key. I get it. I got a key. I got a pee really, really bad.

873
03:12:23,739 --> 03:16:13,610
I got a pee really bad. I'll be right back. Take a pee break in a second. He has to clean the

874
03:16:14,170 --> 03:16:26,389
pee up off the floor again. Where are you getting again from? What was the first time?

875
03:16:33,420 --> 03:16:37,100
Somebody just walked around under there. Can I punch a flashlight with the hand?

876
03:16:37,819 --> 03:16:52,940
You know what I was trying to say? What was that? Find a key to the utility door.

877
03:16:53,819 --> 03:17:17,299
I'm so glad I have an actual flashlight. Open. Open. Yeah. Full health. That rat was huge. Yeah,

878
03:17:17,299 --> 03:17:25,159
the rat was huge. What am I going to do about it though? Stunt trap schematics.

879
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:36,149
Okay. Ammonia. What do I do with the ammonia? And where's my gun? Where's my shotgun? Where's my

880
03:17:36,149 --> 03:17:58,010
grenade? Got in here. Key in the toilet. Utility key. Tell the shit stain story.

881
03:18:02,780 --> 03:18:05,739
Restore power to the security checkpoint gate and then enter the utility room.

882
03:18:06,379 --> 03:18:13,850
Where's that utility room? It's over here. It's a pain in the ass to get back.

883
03:18:18,870 --> 03:18:37,379
Paste file. Screenshot it if you want. Oh, a button. Doesn't work. Where am I going?

884
03:18:37,379 --> 03:18:44,149
I need to go all the way around. Someone's going to jump at me or something, right?

885
03:18:44,149 --> 03:18:53,479
Why the hell would they have this backtracking? Who doesn't love a good backtrack?

886
03:19:03,260 --> 03:19:11,530
P story. I thought I went to the bathroom. P'd one time. P came out of me

887
03:19:12,649 --> 03:19:16,649
every time that I go to the bathroom. I hope you're laughing at that one.

888
03:19:22,090 --> 03:19:28,549
This is what happens to those who fail their tests or make the wrong choice.

889
03:19:28,549 --> 03:19:35,350
Save this man, but you can save yourselves. Find the combination to open his cage and

890
03:19:35,350 --> 03:19:41,690
reroute the power back to the two so quickly when he touches the water.

891
03:19:49,260 --> 03:19:57,000
I need another number is okay. Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. Uh, what's in here?

892
03:19:57,639 --> 03:20:01,959
Nothing. What is this? Oh, there's a number on the wall here. It's five.

893
03:20:02,200 --> 03:20:18,680
Five, five, two, three, five, one, two, five, eight, two, uh, jigsaw. What the fuck is all this?

894
03:20:21,260 --> 03:20:35,899
Eight, three, six, six, two, one, two, six, one, five, six, five, six, five, five, three, five, two,

895
03:20:35,899 --> 03:20:40,620
five. Like I just got hit in the head with a wrench and somebody came over. How many

896
03:20:40,620 --> 03:20:56,299
fingers am I holding up? Um, holding up three was five, five, six, three, five, six, five, three,

897
03:20:57,940 --> 03:21:08,969
six, two, three, six, two, two, six, three, one, five, five, five. It's not five. How much time do I

898
03:21:08,969 --> 03:21:36,260
have? Oh, I got ages. Okay. Stand on the weight. Eight, six. Okay. Six is a number. Okay. Uh,

899
03:21:40,340 --> 03:22:33,899
three, four, two. That's not it. Seven, six, five, five, three, six, five, three, six, five, three,

900
03:22:34,459 --> 03:22:47,860
six, twelve seconds. Four three, five. Go this way. What are you doing?

901
03:22:55,530 --> 03:23:07,610
Sensitivity on this thing sucks. All right. Four, three, five. Let's go.

902
03:23:15,030 --> 03:23:31,540
That fast, didn't I? Wait, I need, where the fuck am I gonna get one of these?

903
03:23:32,340 --> 03:24:06,389
Kidding me. Uh, Google dance. Pixel is reusing traps. Uh, is it in the room here? No, what

904
03:24:06,389 --> 03:24:26,290
What about right here? Reusing breath. Stupid. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Got it.

905
03:24:26,290 --> 03:24:39,659
Re-route the power. Oh, security checkpoint up the stairs. Goodbye, Jigsaw. It's been fun.

906
03:24:54,709 --> 03:24:55,709
Oh, TV.

907
03:25:04,709 --> 03:25:11,709
It would have easily been disabled by police procedure, but those procedures were ignored.

908
03:25:11,709 --> 03:25:13,709
Who do you think ignored them?

909
03:25:13,709 --> 03:25:19,709
It's the walking into the explosive trap. I killed him ironically, is what someone said.

910
03:25:21,709 --> 03:25:23,709
I killed him ironically.

911
03:25:25,709 --> 03:25:29,940
Alright, let's go.

912
03:25:29,940 --> 03:25:38,450
Welcome back, detective.

913
03:25:38,450 --> 03:25:58,069
Detective, what? Is that me? I'm dead. Is that me? Oh, my name's Todd? What's my name? Cap. Who's that?

914
03:25:58,069 --> 03:26:11,250
Where are you? What the fuck are you doing? Why would you do that? What are you thinking? What's wrong with you?

915
03:26:11,250 --> 03:26:27,180
Hey, any last words? Do it!

916
03:26:28,180 --> 03:26:32,579
Please, you guys.

917
03:26:41,379 --> 03:26:48,709
Oh, that doesn't happen to you guys.

918
03:26:48,709 --> 03:26:53,040
Hey, you guys don't get... Oh, your head's squished.

919
03:26:53,040 --> 03:26:57,219
Didn't he have a weapon? Where's his door shove?

920
03:26:57,219 --> 03:27:12,190
Where's his weapon? He had a big bat. What the fuck is happening right now? Where's the bat he just had?

921
03:27:12,190 --> 03:27:23,809
Finish the game already. Please, get me out of here. Wait, wasn't I already in here?

922
03:27:23,809 --> 03:27:41,000
Locate the grave site. Please, locate the grave site. Toilet, uh, poopoo, haha. Ban that person for 10 minutes.

923
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:44,299
We gotta make an example out of this person. Ban them for 10 minutes.

924
03:27:44,299 --> 03:27:51,190
Can I press the button? Oh, alright, I can press the button.

925
03:27:51,190 --> 03:27:58,840
Dude, this is easy. This is fucking easy. This game is fucking easy.

926
03:27:58,840 --> 03:28:16,100
Have you found your god? What happened in here?

927
03:28:28,219 --> 03:28:31,229
Okay, that's...

928
03:28:38,620 --> 03:28:42,620
See, I'm a good person. I will at least scroll so you can see it.

929
03:28:42,620 --> 03:28:47,329
And if you want to roll back, you can read it.

930
03:28:47,329 --> 03:29:03,780
Hustled room. What's that? Oh, somebody opened it.

931
03:29:03,780 --> 03:29:09,780
Glass everywhere, please. Ooh, utility. Open this. I don't have... I need a circuit thing.

932
03:29:18,479 --> 03:29:26,760
Oh, how far is this guy's reach?

933
03:29:26,760 --> 03:29:33,469
A gun? Give me that gun. No, give me that gun. Give me that gun.

934
03:29:33,469 --> 03:29:43,659
Why are you waiting for me to come down here? Only enough for me. Give me that gun.

935
03:29:43,659 --> 03:29:56,729
I can use this, right? Please tell me I can use the gun. Yes. Yes.

936
03:29:56,729 --> 03:30:01,100
What do you mean there's only enough in here for you? There's five bullets in here, dude.

937
03:30:01,100 --> 03:30:23,649
Alright, I got a gun. How do you fire the gun? Can I snipe somebody?

938
03:30:23,649 --> 03:30:34,440
Shotgun shell. I wish I could get a shotgun. That would be amazing.

939
03:30:34,440 --> 03:30:44,780
Okay, nothing in here. What's the point of this? A flashlight. I already have one.

940
03:30:44,780 --> 03:30:57,469
Lockpick, okay. Ooh, achievement.

941
03:30:57,469 --> 03:31:09,860
Scalpel. Wait, scalpel versus gun? Are you kidding me? Do I even have to make this fucking decision?

942
03:31:09,860 --> 03:31:22,049
Read that. I have so many achievables.

943
03:31:22,049 --> 03:31:27,340
Oh, there was just a knife in here? Waste of time.

944
03:31:27,340 --> 03:31:33,540
Now let's power this shit back on. I don't even have a map of this place.

945
03:31:33,540 --> 03:31:47,239
Okay, on the only scalpel forever.

946
03:31:47,239 --> 03:31:54,780
I'm going to try to use the gun wisely.

947
03:31:54,780 --> 03:32:06,489
I keep walking on this glass. Does this guy have a healing on him?

948
03:32:06,489 --> 03:32:14,540
Alright, I gotta be ready to fucking shoot somebody.

949
03:32:14,540 --> 03:32:24,059
Alright. Yep, alright. What's wrong with me? What's going on?

950
03:32:24,059 --> 03:32:36,860
What's that gas? Turn the gas off. I gotta turn the gas off.

951
03:32:36,860 --> 03:32:49,360
Punch the door. Wait. Oh, please. Not this shit.

952
03:32:49,360 --> 03:32:51,360
How the fuck am I supposed to get this?

953
03:32:51,360 --> 03:32:54,860
Run out. Get out, get out, get out, get out. Heal.

954
03:32:54,860 --> 03:32:56,860
Get out of the room. Get out, out, out, out, out, out of the room.

955
03:32:56,860 --> 03:33:04,510
This door's sealed. I can't even heal. Do it. Drain the whole thing.

956
03:33:04,510 --> 03:33:27,430
Oh, okay. I gotta have it be on here.

957
03:33:27,430 --> 03:34:09,739
Fuck. There it is. Okay, that's that one.

958
03:34:09,739 --> 03:34:29,860
Damn it. Heal. I can't see it.

959
03:34:29,860 --> 03:34:38,700
I think this is it. I got it. Is it closed somehow?

960
03:34:38,700 --> 03:34:49,549
This is fucking close to shit. I can't...

961
03:34:49,549 --> 03:34:54,139
I don't know. I don't know. It's too fucking...

962
03:34:54,139 --> 03:34:59,489
I'm dead. I'm dead. Just die. Oh, come on.

963
03:34:59,489 --> 03:35:03,459
That was close too.

964
03:35:03,459 --> 03:35:19,260
How far away was this? Imagine dying to pipe mania.

965
03:35:19,260 --> 03:35:23,889
Yeah, imagine dying to fucking die.

966
03:35:23,889 --> 03:35:25,889
What do you want me to tell you?

967
03:35:25,889 --> 03:35:41,450
Where is this? How far away is this pipe wheel?

968
03:35:41,450 --> 03:35:47,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yup, yup, yup.

969
03:35:47,170 --> 03:35:49,170
Okay, remember this guy?

970
03:35:53,479 --> 03:35:59,069
I'll take that gun. Thank you. Okay. Good. Let's go.

971
03:35:59,069 --> 03:36:04,379
All right. Get this right.

972
03:36:04,379 --> 03:36:17,979
What do you mean he's doing the fucking dial?

973
03:36:17,979 --> 03:36:19,979
What are you talking about? I didn't just pick it up?

974
03:36:19,979 --> 03:36:32,899
Okay, there it is. There's that one.

975
03:36:32,899 --> 03:36:34,899
Let's go middle. Out.

976
03:36:34,899 --> 03:37:15,590
Fucking already dead.

977
03:37:16,590 --> 03:37:24,780
Take a fucking heal. What are you doing?

978
03:37:24,780 --> 03:37:29,069
I hate these fucking...

979
03:37:29,069 --> 03:37:31,069
It's not even a puzzle. It's just like dumb.

980
03:37:31,069 --> 03:37:39,180
I have to get the fuck out of here.

981
03:37:39,180 --> 03:37:41,180
Fucking delete this game. Delete it.

982
03:37:41,180 --> 03:37:43,180
Remove it. Delete from the Xbox.

983
03:37:43,180 --> 03:37:50,399
Eat, drink, paint dinner.

984
03:37:50,399 --> 03:38:01,600
I'm going to drink it. How do I drink it?

985
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:03,600
Oh, not you. Not you.

986
03:38:03,600 --> 03:38:05,600
Hey, guys. I have an idea. No.

987
03:38:05,600 --> 03:38:08,799
I'm saying in the game, I just picked it up.

988
03:38:08,799 --> 03:38:10,799
No. What the fuck are you talking about?

989
03:38:10,799 --> 03:38:18,030
What?

990
03:38:23,430 --> 03:38:25,430
All right. I've got the coupling device.

991
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:29,260
Here we go.

992
03:38:29,260 --> 03:38:32,139
Go back in and break the wall.

993
03:38:32,139 --> 03:38:44,540
No. I don't want to.

994
03:38:44,540 --> 03:38:52,659
I don't want to.

995
03:38:52,659 --> 03:38:55,610
I just walk into a wall.

996
03:38:55,610 --> 03:38:59,770
All right. Checkpoint.

997
03:38:59,770 --> 03:39:14,620
Don't fucking move. Don't move.

998
03:39:14,620 --> 03:39:16,790
I've got a gun. As you know, I have a gun.

999
03:39:16,790 --> 03:39:34,700
I'm ready.

1000
03:39:34,700 --> 03:39:36,700
Who holds a gun like this, by the way?

1001
03:39:36,700 --> 03:39:43,860
This is the way you hold a gun

1002
03:39:43,860 --> 03:39:46,870
if you're afraid of what it's going to do.

1003
03:39:46,870 --> 03:39:48,870
I've got to get a brace to shit.

1004
03:39:48,870 --> 03:39:50,870
All right. Hold on.

1005
03:39:50,870 --> 03:40:01,940
I'm ready. I'm going to shoot somebody in the head.

1006
03:40:01,940 --> 03:40:10,200
Uh-oh.

1007
03:40:10,200 --> 03:40:34,700
I got him. All right.

1008
03:40:34,700 --> 03:40:36,700
I see it this time. I see it.

1009
03:40:36,700 --> 03:40:38,700
I see it. Okay.

1010
03:40:38,700 --> 03:40:40,700
It's not going to happen.

1011
03:40:40,700 --> 03:40:42,700
Y'all were waiting for it. It's not going to happen.

1012
03:40:42,700 --> 03:40:51,270
I saw them. Pick it up.

1013
03:40:51,270 --> 03:40:54,579
A. A?

1014
03:40:54,579 --> 03:40:56,579
Okay. That was stupid.

1015
03:40:56,579 --> 03:41:04,840
No more of those, right?

1016
03:41:04,840 --> 03:41:06,840
No more.

1017
03:41:06,840 --> 03:41:09,590
I saw it. Wait. No.

1018
03:41:09,590 --> 03:41:11,590
That's an arm? Okay.

1019
03:41:11,590 --> 03:41:24,440
I want to go up.

1020
03:41:24,440 --> 03:41:26,440
I can't make a mollusk.

1021
03:41:26,440 --> 03:41:37,959
Somebody's up here.

1022
03:41:37,959 --> 03:42:01,860
Ooh, a lock pick.

1023
03:42:01,860 --> 03:42:09,479
Damn it. Damn it.

1024
03:42:09,479 --> 03:42:11,909
I have a flashlight. Do they run out of battery or something?

1025
03:42:11,909 --> 03:42:16,780
Why do they keep showing up?

1026
03:42:16,780 --> 03:42:19,340
Breakable wall? How do I just punch?

1027
03:42:19,340 --> 03:42:24,069
I don't want to shoot the gun. How do I just punch?

1028
03:42:24,069 --> 03:42:29,829
No. You dumbass.

1029
03:42:29,829 --> 03:42:33,479
I just want to punch.

1030
03:42:33,479 --> 03:42:35,479
How do I drop the gun? I can't drop the gun.

1031
03:42:35,479 --> 03:42:38,170
There's no drop gun.

1032
03:42:38,170 --> 03:42:43,670
Heavy attack? No. I just tried to pick up.

1033
03:42:43,670 --> 03:42:47,239
Oh, well.

1034
03:42:47,239 --> 03:42:49,610
Left bumper?

1035
03:42:49,610 --> 03:42:59,139
Oh. Left bumper. Where's the gun now?

1036
03:42:59,139 --> 03:43:04,379
Okay. I'm ready.

1037
03:43:04,379 --> 03:43:07,319
Gas.

1038
03:43:07,319 --> 03:43:11,420
Stunt trap.

1039
03:43:11,420 --> 03:43:19,100
RB cycle. Stunt trap.

1040
03:43:19,100 --> 03:43:25,239
Do I just throw it at people?

1041
03:43:25,239 --> 03:43:27,989
Can I make anything else?

1042
03:43:27,989 --> 03:43:33,100
Yes.

1043
03:43:33,100 --> 03:43:43,979
Don't make me start doing that.

1044
03:43:43,979 --> 03:43:47,819
I don't want to start doing that.

1045
03:43:47,819 --> 03:43:51,209
Where the hell am I going?

1046
03:43:51,209 --> 03:43:53,209
Out in the courtyard. The graveyard.

1047
03:43:53,209 --> 03:44:01,129
This way.

1048
03:44:01,129 --> 03:44:04,069
This glass is just like fine.

1049
03:44:04,069 --> 03:44:07,079
Do I have no heels?

1050
03:44:07,079 --> 03:44:10,219
I don't have a heel. How the fuck is that possible?

1051
03:44:10,219 --> 03:44:17,260
I used them all?

1052
03:44:17,260 --> 03:44:24,549
Here, my honey. Please come down.

1053
03:44:24,549 --> 03:44:26,549
I made your favorite food.

1054
03:44:26,549 --> 03:44:29,370
Well, prove that you are who you're saying you are.

1055
03:44:29,370 --> 03:44:34,620
And what's my favorite food?

1056
03:44:34,620 --> 03:44:37,110
Hmm? Why don't you prove it?

1057
03:44:37,110 --> 03:44:40,229
What is it? Pop tarts?

1058
03:44:40,229 --> 03:44:42,229
Nope. Wrong.

1059
03:44:42,229 --> 03:44:44,409
It's not my favorite food.

1060
03:44:44,409 --> 03:44:54,379
Okay.

1061
03:44:54,379 --> 03:44:57,450
Sorry. Wrong.

1062
03:44:57,450 --> 03:44:59,450
McChicken? You know, it's close.

1063
03:44:59,450 --> 03:45:08,219
How do I get in here?

1064
03:45:08,219 --> 03:45:12,059
Go that way? Down there?

1065
03:45:12,059 --> 03:45:14,059
What is that?

1066
03:45:14,059 --> 03:45:18,729
Locate the grave site.

1067
03:45:18,729 --> 03:45:20,729
Salmon? No. Close, though.

1068
03:45:20,729 --> 03:45:22,899
Actually, not even close. Not even remotely close.

1069
03:45:22,899 --> 03:45:24,899
Oh, I have to trigger the event.

1070
03:45:24,899 --> 03:45:37,510
Okay, who cares?

1071
03:45:37,510 --> 03:45:40,069
Yeah, that guy kills people.

1072
03:45:40,069 --> 03:45:43,459
I know. I know.

1073
03:45:43,459 --> 03:45:47,690
He kills people.

1074
03:45:47,690 --> 03:45:57,100
Is there anybody behind me?

1075
03:45:57,100 --> 03:46:00,420
It's got kind of loud sounds behind me.

1076
03:46:00,420 --> 03:46:02,420
You guys hear that?

1077
03:46:02,420 --> 03:46:13,159
McChicken?

1078
03:46:13,159 --> 03:46:15,159
I mean, I love McChickens. Don't get me wrong.

1079
03:46:15,159 --> 03:46:18,809
What is my absolute all-time favorite food?

1080
03:46:18,809 --> 03:46:20,809
What's my favorite food?

1081
03:46:20,809 --> 03:46:25,420
I think I used that help.

1082
03:46:25,420 --> 03:46:29,129
What's my favorite food?

1083
03:46:29,129 --> 03:46:31,129
Wait, I want to unlock that door down here.

1084
03:46:31,129 --> 03:46:34,200
Wobster? No. Gross.

1085
03:46:34,200 --> 03:46:39,899
Um...

1086
03:46:39,899 --> 03:46:41,899
It's probably chicken related.

1087
03:46:41,899 --> 03:46:47,780
I'm not sure it's chicken exactly.

1088
03:46:47,780 --> 03:46:49,780
It's probably chicken related, though.

1089
03:46:49,780 --> 03:46:52,979
This is a tough one.

1090
03:46:52,979 --> 03:46:58,790
It probably is like a good crispy chicken sandwich.

1091
03:46:58,790 --> 03:47:03,209
Bomb in here.

1092
03:47:03,209 --> 03:47:06,409
I need another...

1093
03:47:06,409 --> 03:47:12,100
What's that?

1094
03:47:12,100 --> 03:47:16,889
No, I don't care. I have a gun.

1095
03:47:16,889 --> 03:47:24,760
I don't need that.

1096
03:47:24,760 --> 03:47:26,940
Did I just waste one of those?

1097
03:47:26,940 --> 03:47:28,940
Can I take it back? Give me back.

1098
03:47:28,940 --> 03:47:31,559
Give that back.

1099
03:47:31,559 --> 03:47:37,180
Did I use it?

1100
03:47:37,180 --> 03:47:41,209
I think I used it.

1101
03:47:41,209 --> 03:47:43,209
Fucking hurry, hurry, hurry.

1102
03:47:43,209 --> 03:47:45,379
Oh, it's that thing.

1103
03:47:45,379 --> 03:47:50,180
I'm the McChicken guy thing, right?

1104
03:47:50,180 --> 03:48:00,809
Are we coffee pasta?

1105
03:48:00,809 --> 03:48:03,819
No, it's not.

1106
03:48:03,819 --> 03:48:08,809
Oh, gear, paint, and paint thinner.

1107
03:48:08,809 --> 03:48:10,809
All right, let me just get...

1108
03:48:10,809 --> 03:48:12,809
I have to do it, but I want the gun.

1109
03:48:12,809 --> 03:48:14,809
I don't want that.

1110
03:48:14,809 --> 03:48:19,659
I wasted a fucking gear.

1111
03:48:19,659 --> 03:48:23,430
All right, back out of here.

1112
03:48:23,430 --> 03:48:30,219
Bring that paint thinner.

1113
03:48:30,219 --> 03:48:32,219
All right, so now I just have to go back?

1114
03:48:32,219 --> 03:48:34,219
Do I have to just backtrack?

1115
03:48:34,219 --> 03:48:36,219
I mean, the guy was choking somebody up here, wasn't he?

1116
03:48:36,219 --> 03:48:39,739
What's the point of coming in here?

1117
03:48:39,739 --> 03:48:41,739
I didn't get anything new.

1118
03:48:41,739 --> 03:48:45,829
Is something else open?

1119
03:48:45,829 --> 03:48:49,350
I mean, I guess I have to go...

1120
03:48:49,350 --> 03:48:55,159
Where am I supposed to go?

1121
03:48:55,159 --> 03:48:57,159
In there somehow, but...

1122
03:48:57,159 --> 03:48:59,159
Go back?

1123
03:48:59,159 --> 03:49:08,819
How is he such a noob?

1124
03:49:08,819 --> 03:49:16,500
Who's hacked? Courtyard?

1125
03:49:16,500 --> 03:49:18,500
My stream got hacked.

1126
03:49:18,500 --> 03:49:22,659
I'm here.

1127
03:49:22,659 --> 03:49:29,129
Drop down here?

1128
03:49:29,129 --> 03:49:40,379
No.

1129
03:49:40,379 --> 03:49:42,379
We can't hear you.

1130
03:49:42,379 --> 03:49:44,379
You can hear me. I'm talking right now.

1131
03:49:44,379 --> 03:49:47,319
I did it. Oh.

1132
03:49:47,319 --> 03:49:50,260
What the fuck, dude? Come on.

1133
03:49:50,260 --> 03:49:52,629
What's going on here? Cut it out.

1134
03:49:52,629 --> 03:49:54,629
I'm not muted.

1135
03:49:54,629 --> 03:50:00,579
Now you're making me angry.

1136
03:50:00,579 --> 03:50:13,379
Now you're making me very angry.

1137
03:50:13,379 --> 03:50:15,379
I guess I could go back up here and look around.

1138
03:50:15,379 --> 03:50:17,379
Did I do everything up here?

1139
03:50:17,379 --> 03:50:23,399
Hit the mute.

1140
03:50:23,399 --> 03:50:25,700
What?

1141
03:50:25,700 --> 03:50:27,700
Fix it. There's nothing to fix.

1142
03:50:27,700 --> 03:50:34,409
Are you guys drinking?

1143
03:50:34,409 --> 03:50:36,409
Are you drinking or something? What's going on?

1144
03:50:36,409 --> 03:50:47,350
Let me go this way, I guess.

1145
03:50:47,350 --> 03:50:50,299
Holy shit.

1146
03:50:50,299 --> 03:50:52,299
I know I haven't been here yet because this is here.

1147
03:50:52,299 --> 03:50:56,180
Pick it up.

1148
03:50:56,180 --> 03:50:58,180
How close do I need to get to this before I can actually touch this fucking thing?

1149
03:50:58,180 --> 03:51:00,180
What the hell is going on?

1150
03:51:00,180 --> 03:51:02,180
I'm afraid to do this.

1151
03:51:09,350 --> 03:51:20,739
No shotgun or anything in here?

1152
03:51:20,739 --> 03:51:22,739
No. Alright, we're good.

1153
03:51:22,739 --> 03:51:28,360
Let's move. Careful.

1154
03:51:28,360 --> 03:51:33,860
That was so sloppy, but whatever. I'm here.

1155
03:51:33,860 --> 03:51:36,170
Your late partner holds the key.

1156
03:51:36,170 --> 03:51:44,620
Your late partner holds the key.

1157
03:51:44,620 --> 03:51:51,139
Oh shit, this guy squished.

1158
03:51:51,139 --> 03:51:56,899
I can't go that way.

1159
03:51:56,899 --> 03:52:12,260
He's laughing?

1160
03:52:12,260 --> 03:52:14,819
Why is the violin doing the bug thing?

1161
03:52:14,819 --> 03:52:16,819
You know, I was telling something fucked up was about to happen.

1162
03:52:16,819 --> 03:52:25,270
Here come the bug's violin.

1163
03:52:25,270 --> 03:52:29,370
Somebody's laughing.

1164
03:52:29,370 --> 03:52:36,280
No, I don't want that.

1165
03:52:36,280 --> 03:52:38,280
Fucking holy shit. I almost walked into it.

1166
03:52:38,280 --> 03:52:45,129
What's that?

1167
03:52:45,129 --> 03:52:56,389
Where is it?

1168
03:52:56,389 --> 03:52:58,389
This is kind of scary, I'm not going to lie.

1169
03:52:58,389 --> 03:53:15,989
It's actually kind of scary.

1170
03:53:15,989 --> 03:53:22,139
What bandages? Why did I take these?

1171
03:53:22,139 --> 03:53:24,500
I need these.

1172
03:53:24,500 --> 03:53:30,200
No head exploder.

1173
03:53:30,200 --> 03:53:34,860
Okay.

1174
03:53:34,860 --> 03:53:36,860
I'm ready, I've got my gun.

1175
03:53:36,860 --> 03:53:44,709
I'm not afraid.

1176
03:53:44,709 --> 03:53:51,739
Okay, I got him.

1177
03:53:51,739 --> 03:54:06,260
There's more of you?

1178
03:54:06,260 --> 03:54:11,940
Alright, who do I shoot?

1179
03:54:11,940 --> 03:54:17,959
Who wins this fight?

1180
03:54:17,959 --> 03:54:19,959
Oh, the guy with the bat won.

1181
03:54:19,959 --> 03:54:24,170
Now I'm fucking coming for you.

1182
03:54:24,170 --> 03:54:27,620
Wait, no, he's still alive.

1183
03:54:27,620 --> 03:54:46,229
Get out. What? Who's doing that?

1184
03:54:46,229 --> 03:54:49,559
Where are you? Who's throwing those?

1185
03:54:49,559 --> 03:54:51,799
Is he above me?

1186
03:54:51,799 --> 03:54:53,799
Okay, where the fuck are they coming from?

1187
03:54:53,799 --> 03:54:56,739
Elizabeth?

1188
03:54:56,739 --> 03:55:09,540
There you are.

1189
03:55:09,540 --> 03:55:12,170
Is there a thing? There is a thing.

1190
03:55:12,170 --> 03:55:15,620
Is there a thing right there?

1191
03:55:15,620 --> 03:55:18,950
Got the key. There's one right here.

1192
03:55:18,950 --> 03:55:21,129
Okay, don't touch that.

1193
03:55:21,129 --> 03:55:29,379
Okay, bye. I'll save her life.

1194
03:55:29,379 --> 03:55:31,379
Anybody going to heal?

1195
03:55:31,379 --> 03:55:38,809
Holy shit, nice.

1196
03:55:38,809 --> 03:55:40,809
Oh my god, I get to do this. Where is he?

1197
03:55:40,809 --> 03:55:44,709
Hey, eat shit.

1198
03:55:44,709 --> 03:55:59,540
What was that?

1199
03:55:59,540 --> 03:56:08,100
There was a fire underneath me.

1200
03:56:08,100 --> 03:56:15,459
Okay, I'm actually glad that happened.

1201
03:56:15,459 --> 03:56:23,459
Oh, right.

1202
03:56:23,459 --> 03:56:28,139
I forgot that you exist.

1203
03:56:28,139 --> 03:56:33,700
Shoot him.

1204
03:56:33,700 --> 03:56:35,700
Fuck you. Get away from me.

1205
03:56:35,700 --> 03:56:38,389
Okay, let's go.

1206
03:56:38,389 --> 03:56:41,850
Don't just jump down.

1207
03:56:41,850 --> 03:56:58,020
Stunt trap.

1208
03:56:58,020 --> 03:57:00,020
How do I use the stun trap?

1209
03:57:00,020 --> 03:57:02,020
Alright, shoot him. Get up this time.

1210
03:57:02,020 --> 03:57:06,309
Did it actually go right?

1211
03:57:06,309 --> 03:57:08,309
Okay, this is fucking stupid.

1212
03:57:08,309 --> 03:57:16,629
Where's the molotovs?

1213
03:57:16,629 --> 03:57:20,260
Where's the molotovs?

1214
03:57:20,260 --> 03:57:36,579
They're like a case of them.

1215
03:57:36,579 --> 03:57:38,579
By the way, I got just lucky last time

1216
03:57:38,579 --> 03:57:40,579
because I ended up opening the right box.

1217
03:57:40,579 --> 03:57:42,579
You have to pick up the box that's on the right grave.

1218
03:57:42,579 --> 03:57:44,579
I didn't even look last time.

1219
03:57:44,579 --> 03:57:46,579
Did I? No, I didn't.

1220
03:57:46,579 --> 03:57:53,989
I just opened one.

1221
03:57:53,989 --> 03:58:02,500
Alright, we have our...

1222
03:58:02,500 --> 03:58:07,819
This is the final chance.

1223
03:58:07,819 --> 03:58:09,819
He's kind of getting sick of saying these lines.

1224
03:58:09,819 --> 03:58:12,700
Listen to how tired he sounds.

1225
03:58:12,700 --> 03:58:14,700
You gotta get the key.

1226
03:58:14,700 --> 03:58:16,700
Fucking, you know, whatever.

1227
03:58:16,700 --> 03:58:18,700
You're making this not fun anymore.

1228
03:58:18,700 --> 03:58:36,870
Oh, he's alive.

1229
03:58:36,870 --> 03:58:41,219
Alright, I just like...

1230
03:58:41,219 --> 03:58:43,219
I just like Vulcan neck pitched him

1231
03:58:43,219 --> 03:58:51,670
and he died.

1232
03:58:51,670 --> 03:58:53,670
Okay, don't fucking explode.

1233
03:58:53,670 --> 03:58:55,670
Don't get your head exploded.

1234
03:58:55,670 --> 03:58:58,360
There it is. Okay, disarm.

1235
03:58:58,360 --> 03:59:00,360
Now, what was the person's name?

1236
03:59:00,360 --> 03:59:07,959
Okay, I got molotovs.

1237
03:59:07,959 --> 03:59:09,959
Something Smith?

1238
03:59:09,959 --> 03:59:13,350
Something Sings?

1239
03:59:13,350 --> 03:59:22,489
No.

1240
03:59:22,489 --> 03:59:32,860
What the fuck?

1241
03:59:32,860 --> 03:59:39,959
There's another one. Watch it.

1242
03:59:39,959 --> 03:59:44,629
Jacob Schmidt? Director Stevens?

1243
03:59:44,629 --> 03:59:46,629
Okay, this is it.

1244
03:59:46,629 --> 03:59:51,239
I got the key to the Cedar Ward.

1245
03:59:51,239 --> 03:59:53,739
I'm ready.

1246
03:59:53,739 --> 03:59:56,100
I have five molotovs.

1247
03:59:56,100 --> 04:00:00,520
You have the key to Cedar Ward to save her life.

1248
04:00:00,520 --> 04:00:05,430
Got it.

1249
04:00:05,430 --> 04:00:07,430
Can I get a checkpoint, please?

1250
04:00:07,430 --> 04:00:15,049
We're completing that.

1251
04:00:15,049 --> 04:00:17,049
Search the Cedar Ward for Jigsaw's next clue.

1252
04:00:17,049 --> 04:00:20,500
Can I just walk through this?

1253
04:00:20,500 --> 04:00:33,819
What? The way that I said Jigsaw?

1254
04:00:33,819 --> 04:00:36,489
Who cares?

1255
04:00:36,489 --> 04:00:38,489
I said Jigsaw, I said it fast, whatever.

1256
04:00:38,489 --> 04:00:50,629
What's the point of this?

1257
04:00:50,629 --> 04:00:59,530
Stupid, what's this here for?

1258
04:00:59,530 --> 04:01:05,079
Why is this here? How can it happen?

1259
04:01:05,079 --> 04:01:07,079
Oh, that's not one. Yeah, I thought that was one.

1260
04:01:07,079 --> 04:01:11,940
This area contains violent patients.

1261
04:01:11,940 --> 04:01:27,500
Find shelter from the bombs.

1262
04:01:27,500 --> 04:01:31,659
Uh...

1263
04:01:31,659 --> 04:01:41,239
No, there's a bomb in here.

1264
04:01:41,239 --> 04:01:43,239
Wait, there's a guy in there.

1265
04:01:43,239 --> 04:01:49,819
There's a Minecraft guy in there.

1266
04:01:49,819 --> 04:01:51,819
What did that do?

1267
04:01:51,819 --> 04:02:05,110
I just powered something.

1268
04:02:05,110 --> 04:02:13,239
Sanctuary.

1269
04:02:13,239 --> 04:02:17,590
Did I miss something in there?

1270
04:02:17,590 --> 04:02:19,590
I tried pressing this button.

1271
04:02:19,590 --> 04:02:21,590
Oh, I had to be in the exact perfect location.

1272
04:02:21,590 --> 04:02:24,540
Okay, here we go.

1273
04:02:24,540 --> 04:02:26,540
Holy fuck, you just...

1274
04:02:26,540 --> 04:02:28,540
Alright, watch it, watch it, watch it.

1275
04:02:28,540 --> 04:02:31,159
Here we go.

1276
04:02:31,159 --> 04:02:33,459
What the fuck am I doing?

1277
04:02:33,459 --> 04:02:35,700
I just threw a bottle.

1278
04:02:35,700 --> 04:02:37,700
That wasn't a molotov cocktail.

1279
04:02:37,700 --> 04:02:39,700
It was just a glass bottle.

1280
04:02:39,700 --> 04:02:42,069
And I only had one.

1281
04:02:42,069 --> 04:02:50,250
Okay.

1282
04:02:50,250 --> 04:02:54,520
That was dumb.

1283
04:02:54,520 --> 04:02:56,520
Key pole. Uh, 838.

1284
04:02:56,520 --> 04:02:59,850
You just threw a piss bottle at him.

1285
04:02:59,850 --> 04:03:05,350
Oh, I don't have a weapon.

1286
04:03:05,350 --> 04:03:13,219
Or patience.

1287
04:03:13,219 --> 04:03:35,049
Do I have to wait for 40 seconds?

1288
04:03:35,049 --> 04:03:37,049
Close the door.

1289
04:03:37,049 --> 04:03:54,520
Now I have patience.

1290
04:03:54,520 --> 04:03:59,690
Holy shit, I did it.

1291
04:03:59,690 --> 04:04:17,079
Where's my key?

1292
04:04:17,079 --> 04:04:19,079
Ooh, a secret way to go.

1293
04:04:19,079 --> 04:04:31,100
Okay.

1294
04:04:31,100 --> 04:04:34,489
Gonna be in the toilet, right?

1295
04:04:34,489 --> 04:04:38,059
There it is.

1296
04:04:38,059 --> 04:04:42,549
That's really, really hard to not get done instantly.

1297
04:04:42,549 --> 04:04:46,780
Storage key.

1298
04:04:46,780 --> 04:04:55,030
Lock the storage door.

1299
04:04:55,030 --> 04:04:58,170
Okay.

1300
04:04:58,170 --> 04:05:05,510
Moving on.

1301
04:05:05,510 --> 04:05:07,510
I do have to say, I'm getting sick and tired of, um,

1302
04:05:07,510 --> 04:05:09,510
disarm the room full of cartoon dynamite.

1303
04:05:09,510 --> 04:05:13,989
You have no other tricks up your sleeve.

1304
04:05:13,989 --> 04:05:15,989
You ended his life.

1305
04:05:15,989 --> 04:05:18,940
Who saved yours?

1306
04:05:18,940 --> 04:05:46,010
How does Jigsaw call 911?

1307
04:05:46,010 --> 04:05:51,639
Does it just give two scenarios to the dispatch?

1308
04:05:51,639 --> 04:05:53,639
Also, bus full of senior citizens

1309
04:05:53,639 --> 04:05:56,889
is about to fall off a cliff

1310
04:05:56,889 --> 04:05:58,889
down on Fourth Street.

1311
04:05:58,889 --> 04:06:00,889
Are you safe?

1312
04:06:00,889 --> 04:06:12,899
All right, well, get me out of here.

1313
04:06:12,899 --> 04:06:14,899
First you took his father. Will you take his mother next?

1314
04:06:14,899 --> 04:06:16,899
What the brain?

1315
04:06:16,899 --> 04:06:24,760
Explosion rocks downtown.

1316
04:06:24,760 --> 04:06:31,860
Okay. Uh, you could read this.

1317
04:06:31,860 --> 04:06:34,100
Uh, wait, hell, this is about us.

1318
04:06:34,100 --> 04:06:36,409
Lead officer in the Jigsaw killer case

1319
04:06:36,409 --> 04:06:38,409
resigned yesterday due to unknown circumstances.

1320
04:06:38,409 --> 04:06:40,409
Shooting death earlier this week of his partner,

1321
04:06:40,409 --> 04:06:42,409
Detective Stephen Singh, is suspected to be a factor

1322
04:06:42,409 --> 04:06:44,409
in the resignation.

1323
04:06:44,409 --> 04:06:46,409
PAP could not be reached for comment.

1324
04:06:46,409 --> 04:06:48,409
PAP was a fine officer and a defender of the law

1325
04:06:48,409 --> 04:06:50,409
who will miss him.

1326
04:06:50,409 --> 04:06:53,610
Detective Mark Hoffman, a similarly

1327
04:06:53,610 --> 04:06:55,610
decorated officer,

1328
04:06:55,610 --> 04:06:57,610
will be taking over the lead position.

1329
04:06:57,610 --> 04:07:03,420
Okay, explosion tape, whatever it's called.

1330
04:07:03,420 --> 04:07:31,770
Uh, dear Mrs. Singh,

1331
04:07:31,770 --> 04:07:33,770
we have received notice from Stanworth Elementary

1332
04:07:33,770 --> 04:07:35,770
that you have not responded to concerns

1333
04:07:35,770 --> 04:07:37,770
raised by your son Franklin's school counselor.

1334
04:07:37,770 --> 04:07:40,709
Okay, please

1335
04:07:40,709 --> 04:07:42,709
respond within 10 days.

1336
04:07:42,709 --> 04:07:50,069
Uh, kind of

1337
04:07:50,069 --> 04:07:52,069
this apartment is something going on.

1338
04:07:52,069 --> 04:07:55,459
Fire detective David Tapp

1339
04:07:55,459 --> 04:07:57,459
has antics got his partner Stephen Singh killed

1340
04:07:57,459 --> 04:07:59,459
which in my book makes him too dangerous to carry a gun.

1341
04:07:59,459 --> 04:08:01,459
Who knows when he plans to go rogue.

1342
04:08:01,459 --> 04:08:06,139
Criminal charges against

1343
04:08:06,139 --> 04:08:08,889
Tapp. Got my husband killed.

1344
04:08:08,889 --> 04:08:11,579
He's no better than Jigsaw.

1345
04:08:11,579 --> 04:08:17,270
Right, stick it to him. Some lore there.

1346
04:08:17,270 --> 04:08:26,409
Pfft, you

1347
04:08:26,409 --> 04:08:36,120
already there? I guess not.

1348
04:08:36,120 --> 04:08:41,690
What tapes?

1349
04:08:41,690 --> 04:08:52,569
Look at what you did in here!

1350
04:08:52,569 --> 04:09:14,780
Look at the true

1351
04:09:14,780 --> 04:09:16,780
destroyer of

1352
04:09:16,780 --> 04:09:19,659
lives.

1353
04:09:19,659 --> 04:09:25,670
It's me. Okay, let's

1354
04:09:25,670 --> 04:09:27,670
get the key.

1355
04:09:27,670 --> 04:09:35,610
You destroyed their lives.

1356
04:09:35,610 --> 04:09:37,610
I just tortured them to

1357
04:09:37,610 --> 04:09:39,610
death and killed them. Here we go.

1358
04:09:39,610 --> 04:09:44,469
Who said that? Here we go.

1359
04:09:44,469 --> 04:09:54,059
Looks like we're going in here.

1360
04:09:54,059 --> 04:10:12,549
Tortured to death AND killed?

1361
04:10:12,549 --> 04:10:14,790
Say it ain't so.

1362
04:10:14,790 --> 04:10:24,700
Yeah. He's leaving me notes

1363
04:10:24,700 --> 04:10:30,260
on how to make stuff. Jigsaw,

1364
04:10:30,260 --> 04:10:33,020
you know, you could just be a

1365
04:10:33,020 --> 04:10:37,100
DM.

1366
04:10:37,100 --> 04:10:39,100
I feel like that's a good avenue for you.

1367
04:10:39,100 --> 04:10:41,100
You don't have to do all this fucking weird shit.

1368
04:10:41,100 --> 04:10:46,280
Wingless angels

1369
04:10:46,280 --> 04:10:49,290
must fall. Wingless

1370
04:10:49,290 --> 04:10:53,260
angels must fall.

1371
04:10:53,260 --> 04:11:01,940
Sure. Okay.

1372
04:11:01,940 --> 04:11:08,540
What was that? Is somebody here?

1373
04:11:08,540 --> 04:11:10,540
Nothing to the work. I need a

1374
04:11:10,540 --> 04:11:12,540
weapon. Oh, there's

1375
04:11:12,540 --> 04:11:14,540
a weapon. Am I

1376
04:11:14,540 --> 04:11:16,540
safe? You and LSD

1377
04:11:16,540 --> 04:11:21,850
fucking messes you up.

1378
04:11:21,850 --> 04:11:28,059
Where is this person? Alright, I'm getting the bat.

1379
04:11:28,059 --> 04:11:30,059
He's not going to be there.

1380
04:11:30,059 --> 04:11:53,159
Skip steps.

1381
04:11:53,159 --> 04:11:55,909
Oh, you idiot.

1382
04:11:55,909 --> 04:12:07,430
Alright, now I got a

1383
04:12:07,430 --> 04:12:09,930
bat. Nothing scares me now.

1384
04:12:09,930 --> 04:12:13,319
I'm going to try DMT.

1385
04:12:13,319 --> 04:12:22,899
No. Alright, I'm ready.

1386
04:12:22,899 --> 04:12:34,979
I'm going to gear. Oh, it's

1387
04:12:34,979 --> 04:12:36,979
the TV's doing this shit.

1388
04:12:36,979 --> 04:12:39,670
Falling. Falling. Falling.

1389
04:12:39,670 --> 04:12:41,670
Angel. Alright, come on.

1390
04:12:41,670 --> 04:12:43,670
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Big money.

1391
04:12:43,670 --> 04:12:45,670
Big money. Big money. Come on. No whammies. No whammies.

1392
04:12:45,670 --> 04:12:47,670
No whammies. No, come on. Big money. Stop.

1393
04:12:47,670 --> 04:12:56,629
Ugh.

1394
04:12:56,629 --> 04:13:05,979
Oh, you are here.

1395
04:13:05,979 --> 04:13:07,979
Hey.

1396
04:13:07,979 --> 04:13:09,979
Can you open the door?

1397
04:13:09,979 --> 04:13:12,219
I'm being such a fucking weirdo.

1398
04:13:12,219 --> 04:13:21,799
It's a letter. There's a flashlight.

1399
04:13:21,799 --> 04:13:23,799
There's a lighter. No, it's a lighter. I don't want

1400
04:13:23,799 --> 04:13:25,799
a lighter. Why would I want a lighter right now?

1401
04:13:25,799 --> 04:13:27,799
It's so much worse.

1402
04:13:27,799 --> 04:13:34,780
Alright, open these doors.

1403
04:13:34,780 --> 04:13:43,079
Power this thing. Alright, well.

1404
04:13:43,079 --> 04:13:46,020
Let me time this up.

1405
04:13:46,020 --> 04:13:49,989
That guy's

1406
04:13:49,989 --> 04:13:52,360
not scary.

1407
04:13:52,360 --> 04:13:55,940
I need one of those stupid things.

1408
04:13:55,940 --> 04:14:04,569
I can't go in here.

1409
04:14:04,569 --> 04:14:06,569
It's just sitting in one of these dumb drawers that I didn't look in.

1410
04:14:06,569 --> 04:14:09,190
Is it in a drawer or something?

1411
04:14:09,190 --> 04:14:11,190
Where the hell is this?

1412
04:14:11,190 --> 04:14:19,190
Of course, right there. Give me a room.

1413
04:14:19,190 --> 04:14:24,120
Okay.

1414
04:14:24,120 --> 04:14:26,120
Let's do the same puzzle that we've done already

1415
04:14:26,120 --> 04:14:28,120
a thousand times except it's way bigger

1416
04:14:28,120 --> 04:14:40,600
now.

1417
04:14:40,600 --> 04:14:42,600
What the fuck am I supposed to do about this shit?

1418
04:14:42,600 --> 04:15:04,469
I

1419
04:15:04,469 --> 04:15:06,469
I hate this. I don't want to do this.

1420
04:15:06,469 --> 04:15:23,110
I'm done.

1421
04:15:23,110 --> 04:15:25,739
I'm fine. I don't want to do it.

1422
04:15:25,739 --> 04:15:27,739
I'm done. I don't want to do this.

1423
04:15:27,739 --> 04:15:32,840
I'm done. I don't want to do it anymore.

1424
04:15:32,840 --> 04:15:34,840
I'm done. Okay, I finished it.

1425
04:15:37,340 --> 04:15:45,209
Open this door.

1426
04:15:45,209 --> 04:15:49,299
Alright, now you can close your mouth

1427
04:15:49,299 --> 04:15:51,479
because you're irritating.

1428
04:15:54,040 --> 04:15:58,899
And I will take an upgraded bat

1429
04:15:58,899 --> 04:16:05,370
too, thank you.

1430
04:16:05,370 --> 04:16:07,370
Oh my god. Bonk.

1431
04:16:07,370 --> 04:16:11,450
That's funny.

1432
04:16:11,450 --> 04:16:13,450
Do I have to destroy the angels?

1433
04:16:13,450 --> 04:16:15,450
Wait, this is not an angel.

1434
04:16:15,450 --> 04:16:17,450
Oh, I do.

1435
04:16:17,450 --> 04:16:26,860
Okay, that was easy.

1436
04:16:44,069 --> 04:16:47,020
Okay.

1437
04:16:47,020 --> 04:16:49,020
Oh my god, a ton of money came in.

1438
04:16:49,020 --> 04:16:53,690
I just really lucked it.

1439
04:16:53,690 --> 04:16:55,690
Ishanji gave $70.

1440
04:16:55,690 --> 04:16:58,180
7,000 bits.

1441
04:16:58,180 --> 04:17:00,360
And this is, I believe, like an hour ago.

1442
04:17:00,360 --> 04:17:04,260
Enable face cam.

1443
04:17:04,260 --> 04:17:06,260
Slash enable face cam. Slash disable

1444
04:17:06,260 --> 04:17:08,700
flaccid lock.

1445
04:17:08,700 --> 04:17:11,829
Slash hug germa.

1446
04:17:11,829 --> 04:17:13,829
I don't know any of that. I don't understand

1447
04:17:13,829 --> 04:17:15,829
that line of Java

1448
04:17:15,829 --> 04:17:19,219
that you just put in. Okay.

1449
04:17:19,219 --> 04:17:24,219
Thanks for the 7,000 bits.

1450
04:17:24,219 --> 04:17:26,520
Thanks for the $70.

1451
04:17:26,520 --> 04:17:29,530
Is that why you guys are saying hack?

1452
04:17:29,530 --> 04:17:31,530
That's 70 fucking bucks. Thank you.

1453
04:17:31,530 --> 04:17:34,860
And then non-descript civilian

1454
04:17:34,860 --> 04:17:37,290
gave 10 community subs.

1455
04:17:37,290 --> 04:17:39,290
Thanks for the huge amount of money, guys.

1456
04:17:39,290 --> 04:17:41,290
Thanks for the gigantic pile

1457
04:17:41,290 --> 04:17:43,290
of money that you just dumped

1458
04:17:43,290 --> 04:17:45,719
right onto my lap.

1459
04:17:45,719 --> 04:17:48,149
I'm just like scooping it up as we talk.

1460
04:17:48,149 --> 04:17:53,379
Ah, thanks. What's that?

1461
04:17:53,379 --> 04:17:59,340
This guy's got a cube.

1462
04:17:59,340 --> 04:18:01,899
Alright, if you're going to explode

1463
04:18:01,899 --> 04:18:06,379
then just don't come over here.

1464
04:18:06,379 --> 04:18:08,809
Wait, if he punches me

1465
04:18:08,809 --> 04:18:15,659
is he going to blow up my head?

1466
04:18:15,659 --> 04:18:17,659
I drop this switch and boom.

1467
04:18:17,659 --> 04:18:33,370
Well, don't let it go.

1468
04:18:38,680 --> 04:19:11,770
Out of my way.

1469
04:19:11,770 --> 04:19:13,770
This thing's wired to blow.

1470
04:19:13,770 --> 04:19:15,770
It's going to blow us all up.

1471
04:19:15,770 --> 04:19:17,770
We're all going to die.

1472
04:19:17,770 --> 04:19:19,770
Press A.

1473
04:19:19,770 --> 04:19:21,770
Out of my way or

1474
04:19:21,770 --> 04:19:23,770
this thing will explode.

1475
04:19:27,350 --> 04:19:32,389
Careful with that guy.

1476
04:19:32,389 --> 04:19:34,389
If he lets go of that thing, we're all going to blow.

1477
04:19:36,889 --> 04:19:40,780
What the fuck is this in here?

1478
04:19:40,780 --> 04:19:44,420
Ooh. Alright.

1479
04:19:44,420 --> 04:19:50,120
Wait. Come over here.

1480
04:19:50,120 --> 04:19:59,639
Follow me.

1481
04:19:59,639 --> 04:20:01,639
Where is he?

1482
04:20:01,639 --> 04:20:03,639
Okay, now I've got to open

1483
04:20:03,639 --> 04:20:05,639
this door. Here we go. Ready?

1484
04:20:32,569 --> 04:20:34,569
Oh, he had a coupler.

1485
04:20:34,569 --> 04:20:40,840
If I get down there

1486
04:20:40,840 --> 04:20:43,459
how do I get down there from here?

1487
04:20:43,459 --> 04:20:53,059
This is crap.

1488
04:20:53,059 --> 04:20:56,389
I just have to do one.

1489
04:20:56,389 --> 04:20:58,389
Alright, well that was easy.

1490
04:20:58,389 --> 04:21:06,180
Anything else? I need health.

1491
04:21:06,180 --> 04:21:09,450
Alright, turn it off.

1492
04:21:09,450 --> 04:21:13,159
Turn the fucking thing off, man.

1493
04:21:13,159 --> 04:21:20,840
It's off, right? That could be me.

1494
04:21:20,840 --> 04:21:25,049
Alright. I wonder how

1495
04:21:25,049 --> 04:21:27,049
far ahead to the game is over.

1496
04:21:27,049 --> 04:21:29,290
Anybody have any idea?

1497
04:21:29,290 --> 04:21:35,370
How close am I to the end of the game?

1498
04:21:35,370 --> 04:21:49,000
I feel like I'm getting close.

1499
04:22:12,489 --> 04:22:14,489
Okay.

1500
04:22:16,489 --> 04:22:19,239
I mean, I think I'm here.

1501
04:22:19,239 --> 04:22:21,909
Tap. Tap in.

1502
04:22:21,909 --> 04:22:23,909
Tap in. Tap.

1503
04:22:23,909 --> 04:22:25,909
Tap time in. Time. Tap in.

1504
04:22:25,909 --> 04:22:27,909
Alright, I'm tapping in.

1505
04:22:27,909 --> 04:22:31,750
Rescue Melissa Singh.

1506
04:22:31,750 --> 04:22:38,840
Don't move. Don't move.

1507
04:22:38,840 --> 04:22:41,020
I'm coming up there and I'm going to

1508
04:22:41,020 --> 04:22:43,020
cut the blue

1509
04:22:43,020 --> 04:22:45,020
wire or whatever I need to do. I'm coming.

1510
04:22:45,020 --> 04:23:00,309
I'm going to do this elaborate

1511
04:23:00,309 --> 04:23:03,319
fucking puzzle. She's dead.

1512
04:23:05,620 --> 04:23:33,719
I'm an iron maiden.

1513
04:23:46,709 --> 04:23:48,709
Time for a lawsuit.

1514
04:23:48,709 --> 04:23:50,709
Okay. Magnetic

1515
04:23:50,709 --> 04:23:52,709
puzzle.

1516
04:23:52,709 --> 04:23:54,709
Move. What am I moving?

1517
04:23:54,709 --> 04:23:56,709
Okay. We're moving down. Then we're moving

1518
04:23:56,709 --> 04:24:00,680
down.

1519
04:24:00,680 --> 04:24:03,479
Oh. Okay.

1520
04:24:03,479 --> 04:24:05,479
Whatever. I skipped the steps.

1521
04:24:05,479 --> 04:24:07,479
He'll be fine.

1522
04:24:07,479 --> 04:24:09,780
And then we got to go over.

1523
04:24:09,780 --> 04:24:11,780
Then we got to go up, left, down.

1524
04:24:11,780 --> 04:24:13,780
And then right.

1525
04:24:13,780 --> 04:24:15,780
And then down. And then she's going to get

1526
04:24:15,780 --> 04:24:17,780
killed. I

1527
04:24:17,780 --> 04:24:20,920
think.

1528
04:24:20,920 --> 04:24:22,920
Okay. I did it. The game doesn't even

1529
04:24:22,920 --> 04:24:26,819
care. I win.

1530
04:24:26,819 --> 04:24:28,819
Hey, don't worry. He fucked up the programming

1531
04:24:28,819 --> 04:24:30,819
on this thing. I'm going to get you out of here.

1532
04:24:30,819 --> 04:24:41,379
Oh. That one worked.

1533
04:24:41,379 --> 04:24:57,430
Only one more. Oh.

1534
04:24:57,430 --> 04:24:59,430
This is the fastest probably anyone's ever done this in the

1535
04:24:59,430 --> 04:25:02,309
game. Okay.

1536
04:25:02,309 --> 04:25:04,309
This one. Whatever. We're going this way.

1537
04:25:04,309 --> 04:25:15,129
Alright.

1538
04:25:15,129 --> 04:25:21,020
Cool. Wait. That one worked.

1539
04:25:21,020 --> 04:25:25,479
That was a six, right?

1540
04:25:25,479 --> 04:25:48,709
How do I salvage this?

1541
04:25:58,709 --> 04:26:00,709
Fuck up, Jigsaw.

1542
04:26:17,829 --> 04:26:19,829
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1543
04:26:19,829 --> 04:26:22,329
Hurry, hurry. I'm only

1544
04:26:22,329 --> 04:26:24,329
four hundred pounds. Beat me more.

1545
04:26:24,329 --> 04:26:26,700
I'm up to five hundred

1546
04:26:26,700 --> 04:26:36,420
pounds. That's not enough.

1547
04:26:36,420 --> 04:26:39,299
Yeah. Is the game over?

1548
04:26:39,299 --> 04:26:41,299
Does escape suck? Anybody aware of that yet?

1549
04:26:41,299 --> 04:26:43,299
Oops. Sorry.

1550
04:26:43,299 --> 04:26:46,569
Oh.

1551
04:26:46,569 --> 04:26:48,569
Oh. Okay. You mean that

1552
04:26:48,569 --> 04:26:50,569
storyline wise. Okay. Let's go.

1553
04:26:50,569 --> 04:26:53,379
Escape with Melissa. Find the

1554
04:26:53,379 --> 04:26:59,340
clue. Alright, Melissa.

1555
04:26:59,340 --> 04:27:01,829
Follow me. Hey.

1556
04:27:01,829 --> 04:27:05,610
You good with the gun? I know a thing or two.

1557
04:27:05,610 --> 04:27:07,610
Oh. Awesome. The best line

1558
04:27:07,610 --> 04:27:09,610
that you could just say. Literally everyone, every

1559
04:27:09,610 --> 04:27:11,610
fucking person says that in every movie.

1560
04:27:11,610 --> 04:27:13,610
Every TV show doesn't matter. Every single

1561
04:27:13,610 --> 04:27:17,879
one. Nice.

1562
04:27:17,879 --> 04:27:19,879
And then they spin.

1563
04:27:19,879 --> 04:27:21,879
Flip, flip, click, load, snap,

1564
04:27:21,879 --> 04:27:23,879
snap, zip, flip. Oh, you know, you might.

1565
04:27:23,879 --> 04:27:25,879
You've used a gun, I think, before. Yeah.

1566
04:27:25,879 --> 04:27:28,309
I have. Whoa. Nice.

1567
04:27:28,309 --> 04:27:32,020
That's surprising to me. Your character

1568
04:27:32,020 --> 04:27:34,020
does not seem to be

1569
04:27:34,020 --> 04:27:36,020
somebody that would use a gun like that well. You've

1570
04:27:36,020 --> 04:27:44,659
surprised me. Thank you, every movie.

1571
04:27:44,659 --> 04:27:47,100
I'm sorry, David. You deserve this.

1572
04:27:47,100 --> 04:27:49,100
He said if I made it this far, I could choose

1573
04:27:49,100 --> 04:27:53,379
to leave. Oh, no. You're taking the headphones?

1574
04:27:53,379 --> 04:27:55,379
I'm not. Sorry. Oh,

1575
04:27:55,379 --> 04:27:57,379
please. There's a trip to Hawaii

1576
04:27:57,379 --> 04:27:59,379
at the end of this. You fucking idiot. Nice. Thanks.

1577
04:27:59,379 --> 04:28:01,379
I'm going to get the trip to Hawaii. You can go fuck off.

1578
04:28:01,379 --> 04:28:03,379
Yeah, take your, like, seventy-two

1579
04:28:03,379 --> 04:28:05,379
dollar headphones. I'm getting a seven-thousand

1580
04:28:05,379 --> 04:28:07,379
dollar trip to fucking Hawaii. What an idiot.

1581
04:28:07,379 --> 04:28:09,379
We're so close to the end, too. You're going to

1582
04:28:09,379 --> 04:28:11,379
take the fucking. Unbelievable. What a moron.

1583
04:28:13,690 --> 04:28:23,030
You paint these?

1584
04:28:23,030 --> 04:28:32,440
Right now, Jigsaw is sitting there

1585
04:28:32,440 --> 04:28:34,440
really getting a little nervous.

1586
04:28:34,440 --> 04:28:36,440
Oh, everybody takes

1587
04:28:36,440 --> 04:28:38,440
the fucking headphones.

1588
04:28:38,440 --> 04:28:43,500
That's getting close. I'm not really

1589
04:28:43,500 --> 04:28:45,500
going to have to pony up, like,

1590
04:28:45,500 --> 04:28:47,500
seven grand.

1591
04:28:47,500 --> 04:28:49,500
Usually they're dead

1592
04:28:49,500 --> 04:28:53,719
two hours ago.

1593
04:28:53,719 --> 04:29:05,940
I have a spiked bat.

1594
04:29:05,940 --> 04:29:07,940
More TVs. Okay.

1595
04:29:27,909 --> 04:29:29,909
You want to step closer to solving

1596
04:29:29,909 --> 04:29:31,909
the puzzle of catching me?

1597
04:29:31,909 --> 04:29:33,909
It is a dangerous game,

1598
04:29:33,909 --> 04:29:36,600
detective. Best games

1599
04:29:36,600 --> 04:29:38,600
always are. Ah, you know, I'll take the

1600
04:29:38,600 --> 04:29:40,600
headphones. Never mind. I'll take the headphones.

1601
04:29:40,600 --> 04:29:42,600
This is, ah, I don't care.

1602
04:29:42,600 --> 04:29:44,780
Locate the puzzle pieces

1603
04:29:44,780 --> 04:29:46,780
in pine, ward, find,

1604
04:29:46,780 --> 04:29:56,889
whatever. Let me guess.

1605
04:29:56,889 --> 04:29:59,579
Key in the toilet. Oh,

1606
04:29:59,579 --> 04:30:02,069
I wonder. Hmm.

1607
04:30:02,069 --> 04:30:04,069
Nope, man, this is something different.

1608
04:30:04,069 --> 04:30:06,069
This is a gear in the

1609
04:30:06,069 --> 04:30:09,020
toilet. So many little treasures

1610
04:30:09,020 --> 04:30:11,020
inside of the syringe

1611
04:30:11,020 --> 04:30:20,040
toilets. All right. There's somebody

1612
04:30:20,040 --> 04:30:22,040
in here that I got to save

1613
04:30:22,040 --> 04:30:25,620
or find or I don't know

1614
04:30:25,620 --> 04:30:29,209
where. I still have this thing on my

1615
04:30:29,209 --> 04:30:35,030
head.

1616
04:30:35,030 --> 04:30:37,909
Same shit every time.

1617
04:30:37,909 --> 04:30:40,860
I'll be honest.

1618
04:30:40,860 --> 04:30:42,860
Just let it be open. Just open it.

1619
04:30:42,860 --> 04:30:46,059
That puzzle doesn't

1620
04:30:46,059 --> 04:30:48,059
it's not even there for any reason.

1621
04:30:48,059 --> 04:30:50,059
Why is it there?

1622
04:30:50,059 --> 04:30:52,059
Just let me open the cabinet at some point.

1623
04:30:52,059 --> 04:30:54,059
Right? Like it doesn't do anything.

1624
04:30:54,059 --> 04:31:14,459
How that works.

1625
04:31:14,459 --> 04:31:17,579
Um, I mean,

1626
04:31:17,579 --> 04:31:19,579
okay, if it were me,

1627
04:31:19,579 --> 04:31:21,579
well, I could just leave without a

1628
04:31:21,579 --> 04:31:25,100
problem. Somebody's here.

1629
04:31:25,100 --> 04:31:28,360
Okay, are we ever going to find out who's the

1630
04:31:28,360 --> 04:31:30,360
person that's upstairs making all that noise?

1631
04:31:30,360 --> 04:31:37,079
Hold it from the other side.

1632
04:31:37,079 --> 04:31:40,920
Hold it from the other side.

1633
04:31:40,920 --> 04:31:46,219
And look at this.

1634
04:31:46,219 --> 04:31:48,459
I'm here.

1635
04:31:48,459 --> 04:31:50,459
I'm coming.

1636
04:31:50,459 --> 04:31:57,100
Yes. Am I the

1637
04:31:57,100 --> 04:32:00,680
I'm scary. I'm the scary

1638
04:32:00,680 --> 04:32:06,950
guy. Where are you?

1639
04:32:06,950 --> 04:32:17,180
Oh, what happened?

1640
04:32:17,180 --> 04:32:19,180
Did I? Why do I feel like I did that?

1641
04:32:19,180 --> 04:32:24,489
Hey, hey!

1642
04:32:24,489 --> 04:32:27,110
Get away. Get away. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me.

1643
04:32:27,110 --> 04:32:31,909
I'm sneaking through. Get away from me,

1644
04:32:31,909 --> 04:32:35,049
please. What?

1645
04:32:35,049 --> 04:32:38,700
Is it still blinking?

1646
04:32:38,700 --> 04:32:40,700
Is it still blinking?

1647
04:32:40,700 --> 04:32:43,260
Why did mine blink? Did I get

1648
04:32:43,260 --> 04:32:45,260
Wait, was that a shotgun thing?

1649
04:32:45,260 --> 04:32:48,200
Was it a tripwire?

1650
04:32:48,200 --> 04:32:50,760
No, it wasn't.

1651
04:32:50,760 --> 04:32:52,760
Was it?

1652
04:32:52,760 --> 04:32:54,760
Oh, come on.

1653
04:32:54,760 --> 04:32:58,280
It was? No,

1654
04:32:58,280 --> 04:33:00,280
shit. Are you kidding me?

1655
04:33:00,280 --> 04:33:02,709
That's so stupid.

1656
04:33:02,709 --> 04:33:07,580
Oh, my God.

1657
04:33:07,580 --> 04:33:23,450
I don't like the lamp.

1658
04:33:23,450 --> 04:33:29,779
Use the paint thinner bomb?

1659
04:33:29,779 --> 04:33:31,779
I don't even know how to use this.

1660
04:33:31,779 --> 04:33:34,599
RB. How do I use

1661
04:33:34,599 --> 04:33:37,220
it, though?

1662
04:33:37,220 --> 04:33:42,580
RB.

1663
04:33:42,580 --> 04:33:44,580
Like RBX

1664
04:33:44,580 --> 04:33:47,400
or something? Is this a juke classic?

1665
04:33:47,400 --> 04:33:49,400
Sick.

1666
04:33:49,400 --> 04:33:56,819
There are four traps in the entire game.

1667
04:33:56,819 --> 04:34:00,659
Use RB.

1668
04:34:00,659 --> 04:34:10,779
I'm doing it right now.

1669
04:34:10,779 --> 04:34:12,779
Jigsaw's plan here. Kill a hundred people just to convince

1670
04:34:12,779 --> 04:34:14,779
someone that they're not, that they're kind of a dick?

1671
04:34:14,779 --> 04:34:16,779
Yeah. I mean,

1672
04:34:16,779 --> 04:34:18,779
that's kind of every one of these movies.

1673
04:34:18,779 --> 04:34:29,849
It kind of stems from

1674
04:34:29,849 --> 04:34:31,849
you are a

1675
04:34:31,849 --> 04:34:35,180
Alright, roll this at him.

1676
04:34:35,180 --> 04:34:44,520
Throw it?

1677
04:34:44,520 --> 04:34:55,909
I got you.

1678
04:34:55,909 --> 04:34:58,220
You piece of shit.

1679
04:34:58,220 --> 04:35:01,099
Ah, you couldn't squeeze through the wall.

1680
04:35:01,099 --> 04:35:03,340
I could.

1681
04:35:03,340 --> 04:35:05,700
Wait, did he squeeze through the wall?

1682
04:35:05,700 --> 04:35:13,830
He's gone now. Not my problem.

1683
04:35:13,830 --> 04:35:20,299
Oh, my God.

1684
04:35:20,299 --> 04:35:22,299
If I didn't

1685
04:35:22,299 --> 04:35:25,430
stop.

1686
04:35:25,430 --> 04:35:27,430
If I didn't stop,

1687
04:35:27,430 --> 04:35:29,430
it would have happened again.

1688
04:35:29,430 --> 04:35:31,430
I hate that.

1689
04:35:31,430 --> 04:35:33,430
What a dumb thing to have in this game.

1690
04:35:33,430 --> 04:35:35,430
Sometimes you're just going to get your

1691
04:35:35,430 --> 04:35:37,430
head exploded.

1692
04:35:37,430 --> 04:35:49,639
The goal here, I don't know,

1693
04:35:49,639 --> 04:35:51,639
is to locate the puzzle pieces in Pine Ward.

1694
04:35:51,639 --> 04:35:56,569
I'm about to take the headphones.

1695
04:35:56,569 --> 04:35:59,130
So, God, I'm sorry.

1696
04:35:59,130 --> 04:36:01,130
What have I done? What do you do?

1697
04:36:01,130 --> 04:36:08,090
It's a heal.

1698
04:36:08,090 --> 04:36:10,090
It's like I'm kind of just pissing into the wall here.

1699
04:36:10,090 --> 04:36:27,159
Alright, what was that?

1700
04:36:27,159 --> 04:36:29,159
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1701
04:36:33,159 --> 04:36:35,159
You don't have anything else.

1702
04:36:35,159 --> 04:36:37,909
Turn on the lights.

1703
04:36:37,909 --> 04:36:40,599
Okay, one.

1704
04:36:40,599 --> 04:36:42,599
Same shit again.

1705
04:36:42,599 --> 04:36:48,860
I just paint numbers on

1706
04:36:48,860 --> 04:36:52,630
walls in

1707
04:36:52,630 --> 04:36:54,630
a 207.

1708
04:36:54,630 --> 04:36:56,630
Oh, look out. I painted a number on

1709
04:36:56,630 --> 04:37:00,150
a wall.

1710
04:37:00,150 --> 04:37:02,970
You'll never find out what the solution is.

1711
04:37:02,970 --> 04:37:04,970
207.

1712
04:37:04,970 --> 04:37:18,330
Which one is this? 209.

1713
04:37:18,330 --> 04:37:20,330
It's 208.

1714
04:37:20,330 --> 04:37:22,330
It's going to be, I know, there's going to be something here.

1715
04:37:22,330 --> 04:37:24,330
It's just shooting the head.

1716
04:37:24,330 --> 04:37:31,180
What is his name? Remember his name?

1717
04:37:31,180 --> 04:37:33,180
You couldn't protect anyone.

1718
04:37:33,180 --> 04:37:38,790
Okay, let's go. Oh, come on.

1719
04:37:38,790 --> 04:37:50,180
Come on.

1720
04:37:50,180 --> 04:37:52,180
Bag of puzzle pieces. One, I thought that said 12.

1721
04:37:52,180 --> 04:37:54,939
This is going to be an unpopular opinion

1722
04:37:54,939 --> 04:37:56,939
and I cringe at the amount of letters this paper will

1723
04:37:56,939 --> 04:38:00,139
receive.

1724
04:38:00,139 --> 04:38:02,139
I think this is a Reddit post.

1725
04:38:02,139 --> 04:38:04,139
I'm going to propose the following. What if the jigsaw killer is good for our moral fabric?

1726
04:38:04,139 --> 04:38:06,139
If you follow the

1727
04:38:06,139 --> 04:38:08,139
methods of the jigsaw killer closely,

1728
04:38:08,139 --> 04:38:10,139
you might see what he's trying to do.

1729
04:38:10,139 --> 04:38:12,139
Make people better themselves. This is one of those comments

1730
04:38:12,139 --> 04:38:14,139
that you have to go all the way down and you have to click

1731
04:38:14,139 --> 04:38:16,139
the show deleted comment because it's got

1732
04:38:16,139 --> 04:38:18,139
minus 500

1733
04:38:18,139 --> 04:38:20,139
clicks on it.

1734
04:38:20,139 --> 04:38:22,139
It's been negatively downvoted so many times.

1735
04:38:22,139 --> 04:38:26,549
This person is fucking nuts.

1736
04:38:26,549 --> 04:38:31,540
I got one of two puzzle pieces.

1737
04:38:31,540 --> 04:38:33,540
Another one of these unpopular opinion pieces.

1738
04:38:33,540 --> 04:38:35,540
Lies corrupt. Remember being

1739
04:38:35,540 --> 04:38:37,540
slandered. How does it feel?

1740
04:38:37,540 --> 04:38:39,909
How does it feel? I don't know.

1741
04:38:39,909 --> 04:38:43,240
Okay.

1742
04:38:43,240 --> 04:38:47,340
The timer stopped? Oh, the timer stopped.

1743
04:38:47,340 --> 04:38:55,139
Nice. Why'd the timer

1744
04:38:55,139 --> 04:39:30,389
stop? Fuck off.

1745
04:39:30,389 --> 04:39:32,389
Lockpick to get a lockpick.

1746
04:39:32,389 --> 04:39:35,529
Give me a fucking break. Wait, somebody's talking.

1747
04:39:35,529 --> 04:39:40,119
I heard somebody.

1748
04:39:40,119 --> 04:39:42,490
Turn on the lights.

1749
04:39:42,490 --> 04:39:46,139
Find the room before the boom.

1750
04:39:46,139 --> 04:39:51,880
Okay. Let's keep going.

1751
04:39:51,880 --> 04:39:53,880
I didn't go in 206.

1752
04:39:53,880 --> 04:40:01,299
Just nails. Cool.

1753
04:40:01,299 --> 04:40:04,310
Wow. Should I even open

1754
04:40:04,310 --> 04:40:06,310
I don't think there could be a thousand dollars

1755
04:40:06,310 --> 04:40:08,310
in those and I don't even care.

1756
04:40:08,310 --> 04:40:10,310
Good. You found the pine ward piece.

1757
04:40:10,310 --> 04:40:12,310
Find the other pieces

1758
04:40:12,310 --> 04:40:14,310
in the oak ward to save life.

1759
04:40:14,310 --> 04:40:16,310
This is just the beginning.

1760
04:40:16,310 --> 04:40:18,310
This is just the beginning.

1761
04:40:18,310 --> 04:40:27,529
How does it feel to be judged for

1762
04:40:27,529 --> 04:40:40,389
auctions? Alright, what's the time to beat on this?

1763
04:40:40,389 --> 04:40:43,590
I'm going to look it up for me real quick.

1764
04:40:43,590 --> 04:40:47,049
There's a saw for the

1765
04:40:47,049 --> 04:40:50,500
Xbox 360.

1766
04:40:50,500 --> 04:40:52,500
This is five hours?

1767
04:40:52,500 --> 04:40:54,939
Six, five, six hours?

1768
04:40:54,939 --> 04:40:56,939
Oh shit.

1769
04:40:56,939 --> 04:40:59,819
Alright, I'm getting. Can I fall

1770
04:40:59,819 --> 04:41:06,729
in this? No, that

1771
04:41:06,729 --> 04:41:08,729
I didn't even

1772
04:41:08,729 --> 04:41:10,729
do that. Okay, whatever.

1773
04:41:10,729 --> 04:41:12,729
That's so dumb.

1774
04:41:24,279 --> 04:41:27,290
Literally one person

1775
04:41:27,290 --> 04:41:29,290
said five.

1776
04:41:29,290 --> 04:41:31,290
That is the name

1777
04:41:31,290 --> 04:41:33,290
you have given me.

1778
04:41:33,290 --> 04:41:35,290
Your words have changed how people

1779
04:41:35,290 --> 04:41:37,290
perceive me, regardless

1780
04:41:37,290 --> 04:41:39,290
of the truth. Now that your words

1781
04:41:39,290 --> 04:41:41,290
are useless, what is

1782
04:41:41,290 --> 04:41:43,290
left?

1783
04:41:43,290 --> 04:41:46,360
Hmm, I'll see if

1784
04:41:46,360 --> 04:41:48,360
I can come get you.

1785
04:41:48,360 --> 04:41:50,659
Six to seven hour game.

1786
04:41:50,659 --> 04:41:54,759
Well, that's to get the

1787
04:41:54,759 --> 04:41:57,509
vacation. You know, I

1788
04:41:57,509 --> 04:41:59,509
still have an opportunity to get the headphones.

1789
04:41:59,509 --> 04:42:13,380
You know what I'm saying?

1790
04:42:13,380 --> 04:42:15,380
That's the same joke. Well, it's

1791
04:42:15,380 --> 04:42:17,380
relevant to how much longer I want to

1792
04:42:17,380 --> 04:42:19,380
stream this game for.

1793
04:42:19,380 --> 04:42:26,729
I wish I had the gun

1794
04:42:26,729 --> 04:42:28,729
right now. Why can't I not have the gun?

1795
04:42:28,729 --> 04:42:33,400
Wait, stun trap. How do I

1796
04:42:33,400 --> 04:42:47,610
throw?

1797
04:42:54,979 --> 04:42:57,159
Nice.

1798
04:42:57,159 --> 04:42:59,659
You're the reason I'm here.

1799
04:42:59,659 --> 04:43:01,659
You did this. You're the reason.

1800
04:43:01,659 --> 04:43:03,959
You're the reason this

1801
04:43:03,959 --> 04:43:05,959
is all happening. I want that key.

1802
04:43:05,959 --> 04:43:13,060
What's wrong with him?

1803
04:43:13,060 --> 04:43:15,500
Why is he losing health?

1804
04:43:15,500 --> 04:43:17,990
Wait, he can come up here?

1805
04:43:41,459 --> 04:43:43,459
That's the game.

1806
04:43:43,459 --> 04:43:45,459
It's alright. Okay, well now I know

1807
04:43:45,459 --> 04:43:47,459
what's going on.

1808
04:43:47,459 --> 04:43:49,459
Stun trap. I got like a thing that said

1809
04:43:49,459 --> 04:43:52,729
activate the stun trap. How do I do

1810
04:43:52,729 --> 04:44:01,029
that?

1811
04:44:01,029 --> 04:44:03,270
Alright, it's a

1812
04:44:03,270 --> 04:44:05,270
stun trap.

1813
04:44:05,270 --> 04:44:07,270
I'm just doing this again. I'm going to cheese this

1814
04:44:07,270 --> 04:44:14,380
again.

1815
04:44:32,790 --> 04:44:37,450
Wait, wait. What?

1816
04:44:37,450 --> 04:44:39,450
Why is he starting to bugle very

1817
04:44:49,369 --> 04:44:51,369
This is really important for me to see if I can do this.

1818
04:44:51,369 --> 04:44:58,520
Is that hurting

1819
04:44:58,520 --> 04:45:05,819
him? Damn it, it's not hurting him.

1820
04:45:05,819 --> 04:45:07,819
I wish it was.

1821
04:45:07,819 --> 04:45:13,060
That's a flashlight. Fuck, he's kicking

1822
04:45:13,060 --> 04:45:19,720
my ass.

1823
04:45:19,720 --> 04:45:32,779
Alright, I got the health back.

1824
04:45:32,779 --> 04:45:35,020
Can I get his weapon?

1825
04:45:35,020 --> 04:45:41,540
He was very nonchalant about

1826
04:45:41,540 --> 04:45:44,360
that whole thing too. I'm going to get

1827
04:45:44,360 --> 04:45:46,360
that key. You're the reason I'm here.

1828
04:45:46,360 --> 04:45:48,540
I'm here because of you.

1829
04:45:48,540 --> 04:45:51,029
You're the reason why I

1830
04:45:51,029 --> 04:45:53,029
got into this situation in the first place.

1831
04:45:53,029 --> 04:45:55,979
I don't want the camera. Fuck the camera.

1832
04:45:55,979 --> 04:45:58,540
Explosive trap schematic.

1833
04:45:58,540 --> 04:46:28,150
What's in there? Never that easy is it.

1834
04:46:28,150 --> 04:46:39,159
Never that fucking easy is it.

1835
04:46:39,159 --> 04:47:38,279
What the fuck?

1836
04:47:38,279 --> 04:47:49,799
Really? That cog besides the

1837
04:47:49,799 --> 04:47:55,240
other cog. I don't even know what you're talking about.

1838
04:47:55,240 --> 04:47:59,529
Now I've got to connect this.

1839
04:47:59,529 --> 04:48:16,919
Done. Why is it so loud?

1840
04:48:16,919 --> 04:48:19,099
Because this game is not

1841
04:48:19,099 --> 04:48:21,909
good. I don't know.

1842
04:48:21,909 --> 04:48:23,909
I think this game expected me to run

1843
04:48:23,909 --> 04:48:25,909
around all over the place. Fight this guy.

1844
04:48:25,909 --> 04:48:37,880
Why do I still want to play this though?

1845
04:48:37,880 --> 04:48:40,119
This is strange. I shouldn't

1846
04:48:40,119 --> 04:48:42,119
want to still do this.

1847
04:48:42,119 --> 04:48:51,590
Turn this shit off.

1848
04:48:51,590 --> 04:48:53,590
Wait, why is this open? This was just

1849
04:48:53,590 --> 04:48:55,590
open. This used to be open. Why is this not open anymore?

1850
04:48:55,590 --> 04:48:59,619
That was open before. Why is it

1851
04:48:59,619 --> 04:49:05,060
closed? I closed it.

1852
04:49:05,060 --> 04:49:07,060
How did I close that? What did I

1853
04:49:07,060 --> 04:49:14,040
do? Oh, I pressed

1854
04:49:14,040 --> 04:49:22,169
this button. Tell me the next

1855
04:49:22,169 --> 04:49:24,979
part. How would I? No.

1856
04:49:24,979 --> 04:49:27,610
Alright TV, tell me what to do.

1857
04:49:27,610 --> 04:49:29,610
Zero seconds left.

1858
04:49:29,610 --> 04:49:37,029
Hello TV.

1859
04:49:37,029 --> 04:49:48,729
Tell me what to do. Why is the TV

1860
04:49:48,729 --> 04:49:50,729
not telling me what to do?

1861
04:49:50,729 --> 04:49:57,319
I guess I can go over here.

1862
04:49:57,319 --> 04:50:06,860
What is this for?

1863
04:50:06,860 --> 04:50:08,860
Turn this on?

1864
04:50:08,860 --> 04:50:13,529
Do I just turn it on? What if

1865
04:50:13,529 --> 04:50:16,540
I think somebody is out here?

1866
04:50:16,540 --> 04:50:27,290
Did I get them? Is somebody following me

1867
04:50:27,290 --> 04:50:29,290
around? Somewhere?

1868
04:50:29,290 --> 04:50:41,819
Where are they?

1869
04:50:41,819 --> 04:50:43,819
Is this all for the other guy

1870
04:50:43,819 --> 04:50:45,819
to immerse? Oh shit, yeah, big bits.

1871
04:50:45,819 --> 04:50:47,819
Big bits.

1872
04:50:47,819 --> 04:50:49,819
I think this is for that other boss

1873
04:50:49,819 --> 04:50:52,759
that I just was fighting.

1874
04:50:52,759 --> 04:50:57,880
We had 10,000

1875
04:50:57,880 --> 04:51:00,819
hits.

1876
04:51:00,819 --> 04:51:03,319
I fucked it up? How did I fuck it up?

1877
04:51:03,319 --> 04:51:05,880
It's 100 more dollars. It's fucking

1878
04:51:05,880 --> 04:51:08,889
insane. Thanks for the 100 bucks

1879
04:51:08,889 --> 04:51:10,889
slime for

1880
04:51:10,889 --> 04:51:15,099
10,000 bits.

1881
04:51:15,099 --> 04:51:17,099
Thanks for giving me and my friends so many laughs over the years.

1882
04:51:17,099 --> 04:51:19,099
I've been watching since early TF

1883
04:51:19,099 --> 04:51:21,099
tuber days. It's a long time.

1884
04:51:21,099 --> 04:51:23,270
The content's always been something me and my friends

1885
04:51:23,270 --> 04:51:25,270
quote all the time. I'm fucking quotable.

1886
04:51:25,270 --> 04:51:28,220
I never get to catch the streams, but just

1887
04:51:28,220 --> 04:51:30,220
wanted to donate and show my love for all the years of laughter.

1888
04:51:30,220 --> 04:51:33,349
Hey well,

1889
04:51:33,349 --> 04:52:14,250
here's a new quote for you.

1890
04:52:14,250 --> 04:52:17,830
Rome wasn't built in the day.

1891
04:52:17,830 --> 04:52:22,380
Go for it anyway. Don't step in that.

1892
04:52:22,380 --> 04:52:31,590
Sick ride.

1893
04:52:31,590 --> 04:52:36,200
All right.

1894
04:52:36,200 --> 04:52:38,200
It still wants me to fight a boss.

1895
04:52:38,200 --> 04:52:40,200
I've already fought him and I've already killed

1896
04:52:40,200 --> 04:52:45,700
him. I'm about to take the headphones.

1897
04:52:45,700 --> 04:52:47,700
Where are they? I'm about to take them.

1898
04:52:47,700 --> 04:53:07,610
I'm going to take the headphones I think.

1899
04:53:07,610 --> 04:53:09,610
Where does this want me to go? Just straight then bang

1900
04:53:09,610 --> 04:53:11,610
a left and go straight. I'm stupid. What's the point

1901
04:53:11,610 --> 04:53:13,610
of the glass?

1902
04:53:13,610 --> 04:53:16,229
I'm just going up.

1903
04:53:16,229 --> 04:53:24,919
Right, okay. Did I just do that?

1904
04:53:24,919 --> 04:53:27,610
Oh, wait.

1905
04:53:27,610 --> 04:53:31,060
Where's this person?

1906
04:53:31,060 --> 04:53:33,060
Why did I shoot him?

1907
04:53:33,060 --> 04:53:35,060
He was going to die anyways by walking into the fire.

1908
04:53:35,060 --> 04:53:42,040
You're going to spawn camp me?

1909
04:53:42,040 --> 04:53:44,040
You even let me come out of the spawn?

1910
04:53:44,040 --> 04:53:47,240
Oh, there he is.

1911
04:53:47,240 --> 04:53:51,020
Okay. I have to get the really

1912
04:53:51,020 --> 04:53:53,020
embarrassing head shot.

1913
04:53:53,020 --> 04:53:55,770
Remember doing this shit to people in

1914
04:53:55,770 --> 04:53:58,069
Team Fortress?

1915
04:53:58,069 --> 04:54:00,069
And the door would open, close, open, close. You'd kill everybody in there

1916
04:54:00,069 --> 04:54:02,069
and then there would be a sniper.

1917
04:54:02,069 --> 04:54:04,069
The door would open, boom! You got head shot.

1918
04:54:04,069 --> 04:54:06,069
It was insanely embarrassing because you were spawn camping.

1919
04:54:06,069 --> 04:54:09,979
This is so dumb to aim.

1920
04:54:09,979 --> 04:54:17,909
I didn't get him.

1921
04:54:17,909 --> 04:54:22,389
Is he still up there?

1922
04:54:22,389 --> 04:54:24,389
I can't see.

1923
04:54:24,389 --> 04:54:29,639
Fire, go away.

1924
04:54:29,639 --> 04:54:42,549
I don't have anything on me. Fucking scream.

1925
04:54:45,110 --> 04:54:47,110
I'm going to scream, I think.

1926
04:54:59,779 --> 04:55:02,340
Explosive trap.

1927
04:55:02,340 --> 04:55:08,869
Make two of them.

1928
04:55:08,869 --> 04:55:10,869
Gas trap. Make another one.

1929
04:55:10,869 --> 04:55:13,369
How the fuck do I use these things?

1930
04:55:13,369 --> 04:55:15,369
I don't even know how to use them.

1931
04:55:15,369 --> 04:55:26,060
RB. Yeah, but

1932
04:55:26,060 --> 04:55:31,819
L2 and R2?

1933
04:55:31,819 --> 04:55:41,610
That doesn't do anything.

1934
04:55:41,610 --> 04:55:43,610
Falsely accused.

1935
04:55:43,610 --> 04:55:55,380
Crank the sink.

1936
04:55:55,380 --> 04:56:01,319
What the hell was the point of that?

1937
04:56:01,319 --> 04:56:06,819
Key in the toilet?

1938
04:56:06,819 --> 04:56:14,119
There are no toilets in here.

1939
04:56:14,119 --> 04:56:20,700
Let's go that way.

1940
04:56:20,700 --> 04:56:26,650
How do I get over there?

1941
04:56:26,650 --> 04:56:29,400
Because we just go.

1942
04:56:29,400 --> 04:56:35,930
Easy bake oven waiting room?

1943
04:56:35,930 --> 04:56:40,729
See you on Friday.

1944
04:56:40,729 --> 04:56:52,819
Fucking hundred and fifty.

1945
04:56:52,819 --> 04:56:59,180
It's another one of those tax bracket increasing screams.

1946
04:56:59,180 --> 04:57:01,180
Holy shit, guys.

1947
04:57:01,180 --> 04:57:05,459
Ready dread.

1948
04:57:05,459 --> 04:57:07,459
Hundred and fifty dollars.

1949
04:57:12,950 --> 04:57:14,950
Just woke up? Did you have to restart the game again?

1950
04:57:14,950 --> 04:57:17,380
Yes.

1951
04:57:17,380 --> 04:57:19,380
I think when you were here, yeah, I had to restart twice.

1952
04:57:19,380 --> 04:57:21,380
The second time was

1953
04:57:21,380 --> 04:57:23,380
a trillion times worse than the first.

1954
04:57:23,380 --> 04:57:25,380
Because I was an hour into the game.

1955
04:57:25,380 --> 04:57:29,159
Thanks for the hundred and fifty fucking dollars.

1956
04:57:29,159 --> 04:57:31,159
Thanks for the hundred and fifty bucks.

1957
04:57:31,159 --> 04:57:34,099
Thanks for the hundred and fifty bucks.

1958
04:57:34,099 --> 04:57:36,099
Thanks for the insane amount of money.

1959
04:57:36,099 --> 04:57:43,700
I'm gonna nail this guy, okay.

1960
04:57:43,700 --> 04:57:45,700
He keeps wanting to give me the camera. I'm gonna take it.

1961
04:57:45,700 --> 04:57:49,159
Don't ask me why I'm doing this, but I'm doing it.

1962
04:57:49,159 --> 04:57:53,450
I'm taking the camera.

1963
04:57:53,450 --> 04:57:58,500
Where does it want me to go?

1964
04:57:58,500 --> 04:58:00,500
Locate more puzzle pieces in the oak ward.

1965
04:58:00,500 --> 04:58:16,119
Fuck, I missed the shot.

1966
04:58:16,119 --> 04:58:25,459
Do it again. How did you get up there?

1967
04:58:25,459 --> 04:58:27,700
Alright, the camera's the stupidest thing.

1968
04:58:27,700 --> 04:58:30,200
I'm putting it back.

1969
04:58:30,200 --> 04:58:32,759
I don't want it. It sucks.

1970
04:58:32,759 --> 04:58:37,939
I don't care. This thing eats total ass.

1971
04:58:37,939 --> 04:58:39,939
Why would you ever use this?

1972
04:58:39,939 --> 04:58:43,849
It wants me to use it so bad.

1973
04:58:43,849 --> 04:58:45,849
But no.

1974
04:58:45,849 --> 04:58:49,240
I can't even find the flashlight anymore.

1975
04:58:49,240 --> 04:59:06,630
Is it gone?

1976
04:59:06,630 --> 04:59:10,599
It was back behind that door. Pain in the ass.

1977
04:59:10,599 --> 04:59:26,090
Oh, it's the worst.

1978
04:59:26,090 --> 04:59:51,619
It's the worst. It's the worst.

1979
04:59:51,619 --> 04:59:53,619
We were the same person.

1980
04:59:53,619 --> 04:59:55,619
I believe that credit should be given

1981
04:59:55,619 --> 04:59:57,619
where credit is due.

1982
04:59:57,619 --> 04:59:59,619
You ruined the man's life

1983
04:59:59,619 --> 05:00:01,619
with your constant insinuations.

1984
05:00:01,619 --> 05:00:03,619
Words are

1985
05:00:03,619 --> 05:00:05,619
powerful, Oswald.

1986
05:00:05,619 --> 05:00:13,880
But so are actions.

1987
05:00:13,880 --> 05:00:15,880
Glad I still have this stupid ass camera.

1988
05:00:15,880 --> 05:00:20,490
This thing's going to get me killed.

1989
05:00:20,490 --> 05:00:28,220
You know what the hell happened in here?

1990
05:00:32,380 --> 05:00:37,740
This one doesn't look winnable.

1991
05:00:37,740 --> 05:00:39,740
That thing looks like it just kills you.

1992
05:00:39,740 --> 05:00:52,659
Closer than we think.

1993
05:00:52,659 --> 05:00:55,740
What if Jigsaw is one of the officers

1994
05:00:55,740 --> 05:00:57,740
that's tasked to catch him?

1995
05:00:57,740 --> 05:00:59,740
Say, detective. Tap.

1996
05:01:01,740 --> 05:01:04,040
They think it's me.

1997
05:01:04,040 --> 05:01:11,189
Wow, somebody else is the reason.

1998
05:01:11,189 --> 05:01:13,189
Not me this time. Interesting.

1999
05:01:13,189 --> 05:01:18,060
Ow. What did he say ow for?

2000
05:01:18,060 --> 05:01:22,790
Holy shit.

2001
05:01:22,790 --> 05:01:34,380
Who's going to win the game of

2002
05:01:34,380 --> 05:01:36,380
Rock'em, Sock'em, Robot?

2003
05:01:36,380 --> 05:01:47,509
He still thinks he's alive.

2004
05:01:47,509 --> 05:01:58,200
Over here.

2005
05:01:58,200 --> 05:02:00,200
No, don't even use a bullet on him.

2006
05:02:00,200 --> 05:02:02,200
Put the gun down.

2007
05:02:02,200 --> 05:02:04,200
I want to drop the gun.

2008
05:02:04,200 --> 05:02:11,369
Did he drop the gun?

2009
05:02:11,369 --> 05:02:15,080
Why use a bullet on him?

2010
05:02:15,080 --> 05:02:24,729
Where's the gun?

2011
05:02:24,729 --> 05:02:36,889
I was going to say that's

2012
05:02:36,889 --> 05:02:41,939
going to be really fucking dumb.

2013
05:02:41,939 --> 05:02:43,939
I fucking hate this game.

2014
05:02:56,549 --> 05:03:14,090
Did I get him?

2015
05:03:14,090 --> 05:03:35,209
Alright, gun. Let's go.

2016
05:03:35,209 --> 05:03:37,700
Don't step on this

2017
05:03:37,700 --> 05:03:39,700
stupid thing. Look, you can't see this shit.

2018
05:03:39,700 --> 05:03:41,700
Give me the lighter. Thank God

2019
05:03:41,700 --> 05:03:43,700
I can get rid of this stupid thing.

2020
05:03:57,000 --> 05:04:10,889
It's worth doing this every time because

2021
05:04:10,889 --> 05:04:13,770
you get the health. I need it.

2022
05:04:13,770 --> 05:04:17,659
Add.

2023
05:04:17,659 --> 05:04:20,659
Alright, let's move.

2024
05:04:20,659 --> 05:04:22,659
Now I gotta go to Oak Ward.

2025
05:04:22,659 --> 05:04:24,659
Is it this way or the other way?

2026
05:04:24,659 --> 05:04:27,349
Doesn't look like it's this way.

2027
05:04:27,349 --> 05:04:29,349
Somebody painted stuff here.

2028
05:04:29,349 --> 05:04:38,939
Why is this game

2029
05:04:38,939 --> 05:04:40,939
long?

2030
05:04:40,939 --> 05:04:42,939
It's not.

2031
05:04:42,939 --> 05:04:44,939
It's kind of not.

2032
05:04:44,939 --> 05:04:50,180
It's only been five hours.

2033
05:04:50,180 --> 05:04:52,180
I think it just feels that way because the game is

2034
05:04:52,180 --> 05:04:55,060
not good.

2035
05:04:55,060 --> 05:04:57,060
It's not very good.

2036
05:04:57,060 --> 05:05:01,479
But, you know,

2037
05:05:01,479 --> 05:05:09,419
it's fine. Okay, we need the last

2038
05:05:09,419 --> 05:05:11,419
puzzle piece and then I'm going to

2039
05:05:11,419 --> 05:05:13,419
assume that this is the climax of the game.

2040
05:05:13,419 --> 05:05:22,700
Are you kidding me?

2041
05:05:22,700 --> 05:05:37,659
What's the

2042
05:05:37,659 --> 05:05:39,659
password? Dude, can you just tell

2043
05:05:39,659 --> 05:05:53,029
me? Move them?

2044
05:05:53,029 --> 05:05:55,590
Am I going here?

2045
05:05:55,590 --> 05:06:05,500
Wait, you got

2046
05:06:05,500 --> 05:06:07,500
what is the password?

2047
05:06:07,500 --> 05:06:09,500
You already have the password.

2048
05:06:09,500 --> 05:06:12,700
What's the password? Somebody just have it?

2049
05:06:12,700 --> 05:06:14,700
What is it? I don't care. Fuck it.

2050
05:06:14,700 --> 05:06:21,610
I'll do it. What is it?

2051
05:06:21,610 --> 05:06:25,319
I don't care. What is it?

2052
05:06:25,319 --> 05:06:32,939
I'm serious.

2053
05:06:32,939 --> 05:06:34,939
Somebody has to just look it up, right?

2054
05:06:34,939 --> 05:06:44,409
74?

2055
05:06:44,409 --> 05:07:06,900
That's not it.

2056
05:07:12,340 --> 05:07:16,630
264.

2057
05:07:16,630 --> 05:07:18,630
Someone will have it eventually.

2058
05:07:18,630 --> 05:07:25,029
457.

2059
05:07:25,029 --> 05:07:31,750
556.

2060
05:07:31,750 --> 05:07:35,779
985.

2061
05:07:35,779 --> 05:07:43,979
7...

2062
05:07:43,979 --> 05:07:47,560
797.

2063
05:07:47,560 --> 05:07:52,810
775.

2064
05:07:52,810 --> 05:07:54,810
765.

2065
05:07:54,810 --> 05:07:58,779
702.

2066
05:07:58,779 --> 05:08:02,549
No, that's...

2067
05:08:02,549 --> 05:08:05,880
Okay, what?

2068
05:08:05,880 --> 05:08:08,060
I'm not trying to be funny. I just want you to tell

2069
05:08:08,060 --> 05:08:11,060
me the answer. I'm going to look it up.

2070
05:08:11,060 --> 05:08:15,290
I don't want to go get it.

2071
05:08:15,290 --> 05:08:20,599
No, it's going to take too long. Fine.

2072
05:08:20,599 --> 05:08:29,669
4...

2073
05:08:29,669 --> 05:08:31,669
You keep saying the same one. 435.

2074
05:08:31,669 --> 05:08:36,090
That's not it.

2075
05:08:36,090 --> 05:08:38,090
No, it's not.

2076
05:08:38,090 --> 05:08:40,779
It's in this link.

2077
05:08:40,779 --> 05:08:42,779
I tried to look it up. It's not in the guide. Yes, it is.

2078
05:08:42,779 --> 05:08:45,590
Rome wasn't built today, but go for it anyway.

2079
05:08:45,590 --> 05:08:47,590
Don't step in that.

2080
05:08:47,590 --> 05:08:51,430
Jeremy here. What?

2081
05:08:51,430 --> 05:09:04,549
I just tried to look it up.

2082
05:09:04,549 --> 05:09:08,200
Where is it?

2083
05:09:08,200 --> 05:09:10,200
Where is it?

2084
05:09:10,200 --> 05:09:12,200
It's going to be right here. Where is it?

2085
05:09:12,200 --> 05:09:14,950
I don't see it. Where is it? Where is the number?

2086
05:09:14,950 --> 05:09:16,950
Okay, number, number, number, number, number.

2087
05:09:16,950 --> 05:09:18,950
Where is it? I don't see a number. No number.

2088
05:09:18,950 --> 05:09:21,259
Am I locked in here now?

2089
05:09:33,139 --> 05:09:43,580
Cool. Okay.

2090
05:09:43,580 --> 05:09:59,380
Um...

2091
05:09:59,380 --> 05:10:06,939
What is this solve?

2092
05:10:06,939 --> 05:10:11,669
I can get to the door.

2093
05:10:11,669 --> 05:10:13,979
I win.

2094
05:10:13,979 --> 05:10:17,750
Wait, is it not...

2095
05:10:17,750 --> 05:10:19,750
Was I not supposed to do that?

2096
05:10:19,750 --> 05:10:36,180
Go, go, go, go!

2097
05:10:36,180 --> 05:10:38,180
What happened to the puzzle up there?

2098
05:10:38,180 --> 05:10:44,139
Did I miss it or something?

2099
05:10:44,139 --> 05:10:48,939
Rigid arms contain the code.

2100
05:10:48,939 --> 05:11:05,959
Sucks.

2101
05:11:05,959 --> 05:11:11,580
I turn this on.

2102
05:11:11,580 --> 05:11:18,599
Spotlight. See, this is what it looks like from my angle.

2103
05:11:18,599 --> 05:11:21,159
This is what it's like to beat the streamer.

2104
05:11:21,159 --> 05:11:23,909
You guys see from over here.

2105
05:11:23,909 --> 05:11:25,909
And it's like, wow, there he is, like on stage.

2106
05:11:25,909 --> 05:11:27,909
This is what I see.

2107
05:11:27,909 --> 05:11:31,860
My internet turn off?

2108
05:11:31,860 --> 05:11:36,009
Oh, hold on, let me fix it.

2109
05:11:36,009 --> 05:11:38,009
Hold on, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it.

2110
05:11:38,009 --> 05:11:40,009
Hold on, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it.

2111
05:11:40,009 --> 05:11:48,580
Hold on, let me fix it, let me fix it, let me fix it.

2112
05:11:48,580 --> 05:11:53,639
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2113
05:11:53,639 --> 05:11:56,709
Fiverr omega lol.

2114
05:11:56,709 --> 05:11:58,709
I gotta change my server.

2115
05:11:58,709 --> 05:12:00,709
It's all fucked up. It's the server.

2116
05:12:00,709 --> 05:12:08,459
Alright, I'm, hold on.

2117
05:12:08,459 --> 05:12:36,150
I will be back in ten seconds!

2118
05:12:36,150 --> 05:12:42,790
Hey, and we're back.

2119
05:12:42,790 --> 05:12:52,950
What's going on? Welcome back to the show.

2120
05:12:52,950 --> 05:13:05,020
We're here? I'm here, right?

2121
05:13:05,020 --> 05:13:07,020
Yeah, I'm good. Alright, yeah, we're good.

2122
05:13:07,020 --> 05:13:09,020
Sorry about that. I, uh, VPNed. I was using the server.

2123
05:13:09,020 --> 05:13:11,020
I was on fucking shit the bed.

2124
05:13:11,020 --> 05:13:13,020
Hey, you gotta fucking have that fucking good security though.

2125
05:13:13,020 --> 05:13:15,020
You know what I'm saying?

2126
05:13:15,020 --> 05:13:21,740
This is the last thing you heard me say.

2127
05:13:21,740 --> 05:13:27,540
206.

2128
05:13:27,540 --> 05:13:40,840
Are you kidding me?

2129
05:13:40,840 --> 05:13:44,840
Slander is not an easy thing to face.

2130
05:13:44,840 --> 05:13:47,590
Okay, goodbye.

2131
05:13:47,590 --> 05:13:50,220
Thanks.

2132
05:13:50,220 --> 05:13:53,669
Can I walk on this? What the hell is this?

2133
05:13:53,669 --> 05:13:57,900
Why did I end up?

2134
05:13:57,900 --> 05:14:00,139
Can I walk on that?

2135
05:14:00,139 --> 05:14:07,299
I feel like I can't.

2136
05:14:07,299 --> 05:14:09,299
What the fuck was the point of that?

2137
05:14:09,299 --> 05:14:11,299
That's the strangest thing I've ever seen.

2138
05:14:11,299 --> 05:14:14,180
God, that was just odd.

2139
05:14:14,180 --> 05:14:16,180
Abnormal.

2140
05:14:16,180 --> 05:14:20,279
Alright, back to that

2141
05:14:20,279 --> 05:14:22,279
door with the thing on it

2142
05:14:22,279 --> 05:14:24,279
that adds 206.

2143
05:14:24,279 --> 05:14:29,659
Now what? Is there a timer going up?

2144
05:14:29,659 --> 05:14:34,970
My god.

2145
05:14:34,970 --> 05:14:38,869
I can't be serious.

2146
05:14:38,869 --> 05:14:40,869
You can't be fucking serious.

2147
05:14:40,869 --> 05:14:48,090
God. Where's the valve?

2148
05:14:48,090 --> 05:14:50,090
Where's the valve?

2149
05:14:50,090 --> 05:14:54,700
I don't even have any

2150
05:14:54,700 --> 05:14:56,700
fucking healing.

2151
05:14:56,700 --> 05:15:12,810
I'm about to fucking die.

2152
05:15:12,810 --> 05:15:15,500
Turn it off. I can't.

2153
05:15:15,500 --> 05:15:31,540
I get it? Take the headphones.

2154
05:15:31,540 --> 05:15:33,540
They're right there too.

2155
05:15:33,540 --> 05:15:35,540
I could just get them right now. I could grab them

2156
05:15:35,540 --> 05:15:41,880
right now.

2157
05:15:41,880 --> 05:15:44,180
They're right there.

2158
05:15:44,180 --> 05:15:46,180
The headphones are right fucking there.

2159
05:15:46,180 --> 05:15:49,319
This is the minor

2160
05:15:49,319 --> 05:15:59,299
I could get the minor prize.

2161
05:15:59,299 --> 05:16:04,939
Prize right now.

2162
05:16:04,939 --> 05:16:13,380
Where did I just end up?

2163
05:16:13,380 --> 05:16:15,750
Where the hell am I going?

2164
05:16:15,750 --> 05:16:17,750
I don't know.

2165
05:16:17,750 --> 05:16:19,750
I have to go down.

2166
05:16:19,750 --> 05:16:23,459
What a dumb system.

2167
05:16:23,459 --> 05:16:26,150
Puzzles. Not even a puzzle.

2168
05:16:26,150 --> 05:16:29,479
It's just anxiety

2169
05:16:29,479 --> 05:16:31,479
I'm doing it first try. Open it.

2170
05:16:31,479 --> 05:16:41,700
No stop you

2171
05:16:41,700 --> 05:16:43,700
over sensitive piece of shit.

2172
05:16:43,700 --> 05:16:45,880
It changes from fucking on you

2173
05:16:45,880 --> 05:16:47,880
really fast. Where is the

2174
05:16:47,880 --> 05:16:51,270
right one? What the

2175
05:16:51,270 --> 05:16:53,270
fuck is happening?

2176
05:16:53,270 --> 05:17:04,020
Where is it?

2177
05:17:04,020 --> 05:17:06,330
It's a

2178
05:17:06,330 --> 05:17:18,549
game.

2179
05:17:18,549 --> 05:17:20,549
This is a three on rotten tomatoes.

2180
05:17:20,549 --> 05:17:23,369
I mean the movie

2181
05:17:23,369 --> 05:17:29,509
too. Both of them.

2182
05:17:29,509 --> 05:17:31,509
What was the point of this? To get another just to get

2183
05:17:31,509 --> 05:17:38,040
replace my gun? Really?

2184
05:17:38,040 --> 05:17:47,830
That fucking prize is looking kind of

2185
05:17:47,830 --> 05:17:50,069
good.

2186
05:17:50,069 --> 05:17:52,069
They can't be much longer.

2187
05:17:52,069 --> 05:17:54,069
Can't be much longer than this.

2188
05:17:54,069 --> 05:18:23,319
There's so much left.

2189
05:18:23,319 --> 05:18:27,400
They can't be.

2190
05:18:27,400 --> 05:18:29,400
When I get out of this

2191
05:18:29,400 --> 05:18:31,400
and I get to the

2192
05:18:31,400 --> 05:18:33,400
I have to get the second puzzle piece

2193
05:18:33,400 --> 05:18:35,400
key. Then I'll determine

2194
05:18:35,400 --> 05:18:37,400
if I'm going to take the prize or not. That's

2195
05:18:37,400 --> 05:18:39,400
on me to decide.

2196
05:18:39,400 --> 05:18:41,400
Where the fuck am I going? Use 206 to gain injury into the

2197
05:18:41,400 --> 05:18:43,400
objective room.

2198
05:18:43,400 --> 05:18:45,400
Where is that?

2199
05:18:45,400 --> 05:18:47,400
Where are we going here? That's death. I would have just

2200
05:18:47,400 --> 05:19:02,119
walked into that and died.

2201
05:19:02,119 --> 05:19:07,939
What is this?

2202
05:19:07,939 --> 05:19:09,939
Why am I laughing at that?

2203
05:19:09,939 --> 05:19:11,939
Up the stairs?

2204
05:19:11,939 --> 05:19:17,130
Does anybody have any

2205
05:19:17,130 --> 05:19:19,130
idea where this is supposed to be?

2206
05:19:19,130 --> 05:19:21,130
I don't remember anything.

2207
05:19:21,130 --> 05:19:23,880
A puzzle. Oh I wonder.

2208
05:19:23,880 --> 05:19:37,000
Wait I remember this part.

2209
05:19:37,000 --> 05:19:40,119
Isn't it like up here?

2210
05:19:40,119 --> 05:19:42,680
It's up here.

2211
05:19:42,680 --> 05:19:44,680
I out here and then

2212
05:19:44,680 --> 05:19:49,610
this way.

2213
05:19:49,610 --> 05:20:02,819
Click on down.

2214
05:20:02,819 --> 05:20:08,500
Alright.

2215
05:20:08,500 --> 05:20:11,319
Can't make anything.

2216
05:20:11,319 --> 05:20:13,560
Can't get out of this.

2217
05:20:13,560 --> 05:20:17,400
Squeeze.

2218
05:20:17,400 --> 05:20:20,659
Still playing this?

2219
05:20:20,659 --> 05:20:23,860
Go this way.

2220
05:20:23,860 --> 05:20:27,700
Why not have an arrow?

2221
05:20:27,700 --> 05:20:29,700
Why not have an arrow?

2222
05:20:29,700 --> 05:20:31,880
Why is there to be a star?

2223
05:20:31,880 --> 05:20:33,880
Why not

2224
05:20:33,880 --> 05:20:36,759
a pointing arrow?

2225
05:20:36,759 --> 05:20:38,759
I need the arrow to point in the direction

2226
05:20:38,759 --> 05:20:41,189
that I need to go.

2227
05:20:41,189 --> 05:20:43,189
I need a GTA thing up here.

2228
05:20:43,189 --> 05:20:45,189
Don't fall off this. I'll be extraordinarily upset.

2229
05:20:45,189 --> 05:20:53,509
Damn I want pizza.

2230
05:20:53,509 --> 05:20:57,029
206.

2231
05:20:57,029 --> 05:21:13,659
Bomb.

2232
05:21:13,659 --> 05:21:15,659
Shoot the lock. It doesn't work like that.

2233
05:21:15,659 --> 05:21:19,240
Alright.

2234
05:21:19,240 --> 05:21:21,240
Well he's dead. Good.

2235
05:21:21,240 --> 05:21:24,700
Why is the music still doing this?

2236
05:21:24,700 --> 05:21:26,700
Molotov. I have 5 Molotovs.

2237
05:21:26,700 --> 05:21:28,700
But I want the gun.

2238
05:21:28,700 --> 05:21:30,939
Let's just have fun with them for a second.

2239
05:21:30,939 --> 05:21:44,169
Is it it?

2240
05:21:44,169 --> 05:21:54,409
I got 2 of 2 puzzles.

2241
05:21:54,409 --> 05:21:56,409
Alright return with the puzzle pieces to the trap entrance.

2242
05:21:56,409 --> 05:21:58,409
Where the hell was that? Who knows?

2243
05:21:58,409 --> 05:22:01,930
I feel like I'm playing Resident Evil.

2244
05:22:01,930 --> 05:22:04,810
But

2245
05:22:04,810 --> 05:22:06,810
just not even close.

2246
05:22:06,810 --> 05:22:13,400
Have a good night.

2247
05:22:13,400 --> 05:22:15,400
Should we do a good night? Should I leave?

2248
05:22:15,400 --> 05:22:17,770
You guys want me to go?

2249
05:22:17,770 --> 05:22:19,770
You guys want me to leave?

2250
05:22:19,770 --> 05:22:22,459
Alright where the hell is the trap entrance?

2251
05:22:22,459 --> 05:22:29,049
Here I guess?

2252
05:22:29,049 --> 05:22:36,090
You're at the end.

2253
05:22:36,090 --> 05:22:38,900
I feel like I am at the end.

2254
05:22:38,900 --> 05:22:41,340
You know what? I'm definitely

2255
05:22:41,340 --> 05:22:44,470
can't give up now.

2256
05:22:44,470 --> 05:22:46,840
To get pizza.

2257
05:22:46,840 --> 05:22:49,020
Yeah I'm going to get a big pizza.

2258
05:22:49,020 --> 05:22:52,020
The biggest pizza you've ever seen.

2259
05:22:52,020 --> 05:22:58,740
30 minutes max.

2260
05:22:58,740 --> 05:23:00,740
Okay.

2261
05:23:00,740 --> 05:23:03,860
Quick I want a fall joke.

2262
05:23:03,860 --> 05:23:07,639
I don't think you're going to get one of those.

2263
05:23:07,639 --> 05:23:09,639
Fall joke requires a checkpoint.

2264
05:23:09,639 --> 05:23:11,639
That is within about 5 seconds of my last

2265
05:23:11,639 --> 05:23:14,630
attempt.

2266
05:23:14,630 --> 05:23:20,819
This way.

2267
05:23:20,819 --> 05:23:26,520
Backtracking bullshit.

2268
05:23:26,520 --> 05:23:28,950
Is it an explosive?

2269
05:23:28,950 --> 05:23:30,950
No it's just stairs.

2270
05:23:30,950 --> 05:23:42,150
I just saw a line and I freaked out.

2271
05:23:49,290 --> 05:23:51,290
Oh you're killing people.

2272
05:23:51,290 --> 05:23:53,290
You are absolutely murdering.

2273
05:23:53,290 --> 05:23:55,290
You're slaughtering people.

2274
05:23:55,290 --> 05:23:57,290
I can tell my man with your words.

2275
05:23:57,290 --> 05:23:59,290
That did nothing to you.

2276
05:24:05,500 --> 05:24:10,599
It's two heels I feel like.

2277
05:24:10,599 --> 05:24:12,599
Quick quick quick.

2278
05:24:12,599 --> 05:24:14,599
The gas is going to fill the room.

2279
05:24:14,599 --> 05:24:16,599
Where is it?

2280
05:24:16,599 --> 05:24:19,799
Where is it?

2281
05:24:19,799 --> 05:24:21,799
The gas is going to fill this whole fucking room.

2282
05:24:21,799 --> 05:24:24,549
Come on.

2283
05:24:24,549 --> 05:24:30,500
Where is it? I knew it. I told you.

2284
05:24:30,500 --> 05:24:32,810
I did it on purpose.

2285
05:24:32,810 --> 05:24:34,810
That was on purpose.

2286
05:24:34,810 --> 05:24:36,810
I knew it because I wanted to fucking.

2287
05:24:36,810 --> 05:24:40,389
Let's go. That was on purpose.

2288
05:24:40,389 --> 05:24:43,020
On purpose.

2289
05:24:43,020 --> 05:24:45,020
Wasn't pretending. On purpose.

2290
05:24:45,020 --> 05:24:47,020
Fucking the checkpoint is right there.

2291
05:24:47,020 --> 05:24:55,450
Where is this fucking thing?

2292
05:24:55,450 --> 05:25:04,090
Take it please.

2293
05:25:04,090 --> 05:25:08,439
No. Okay.

2294
05:25:08,439 --> 05:25:10,439
Next up is.

2295
05:25:10,439 --> 05:25:12,439
I don't know man.

2296
05:25:12,439 --> 05:25:17,619
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

2297
05:25:17,619 --> 05:25:26,950
That's not right.

2298
05:25:26,950 --> 05:25:28,950
That's it.

2299
05:25:28,950 --> 05:25:32,659
What happened? Why is it not doing it?

2300
05:25:32,659 --> 05:25:36,569
Oh it's not correct.

2301
05:25:36,569 --> 05:25:46,680
Do another one. Do another one.

2302
05:25:46,680 --> 05:25:48,680
Do another one. X.

2303
05:25:48,680 --> 05:25:50,680
What are you doing? I'm hitting the

2304
05:25:50,680 --> 05:25:52,680
button X. The button fucking

2305
05:25:52,680 --> 05:25:54,680
X. X button.

2306
05:25:54,680 --> 05:25:56,680
Okay. You decide to do it now.

2307
05:25:56,680 --> 05:26:00,330
What happened here?

2308
05:26:00,330 --> 05:26:08,970
These fucking absolute dog shit.

2309
05:26:08,970 --> 05:26:19,720
Really? No.

2310
05:26:19,720 --> 05:26:31,369
Fuck. It's like right fucking

2311
05:26:31,369 --> 05:26:33,369
there. It's so close.

2312
05:26:33,369 --> 05:26:35,369
But it's just so fucking far

2313
05:26:35,369 --> 05:26:37,369
away at the same time.

2314
05:26:37,369 --> 05:26:50,150
Just kill me.

2315
05:26:50,150 --> 05:26:52,150
Am I just putting this in the game like

2316
05:26:52,150 --> 05:27:03,669
more than five times?

2317
05:27:03,669 --> 05:27:05,669
Imagine not going inside out.

2318
05:27:05,669 --> 05:27:11,430
Fucking

2319
05:27:11,430 --> 05:27:13,430
forgot it was in the room.

2320
05:27:13,430 --> 05:27:18,810
Fucking hate this.

2321
05:27:18,810 --> 05:27:21,430
I need that major prize.

2322
05:27:21,430 --> 05:27:23,430
I'm not vetoing it. No. No. No.

2323
05:27:23,430 --> 05:27:25,430
No. No. I got it. I got it. I'm gonna calm down.

2324
05:27:25,430 --> 05:27:28,119
I'm gonna settle down.

2325
05:27:28,119 --> 05:27:30,119
This is gas and booby trap.

2326
05:27:30,119 --> 05:27:32,119
This is not even

2327
05:27:32,119 --> 05:27:34,119
soft. This is fucking

2328
05:27:34,119 --> 05:27:36,119
Kevin McAllister does this shit.

2329
05:27:36,119 --> 05:27:38,119
Not Jigsaw.

2330
05:27:38,119 --> 05:27:40,869
Okay. Let's go.

2331
05:27:40,869 --> 05:27:46,180
Inside out.

2332
05:27:46,180 --> 05:27:55,080
I don't even know what inside

2333
05:27:55,080 --> 05:27:57,080
out should even be.

2334
05:27:57,080 --> 05:28:04,180
All I see is shapes. I don't see

2335
05:28:04,180 --> 05:28:06,360
anything else. All I see is shapes.

2336
05:28:06,360 --> 05:28:09,049
I don't see anything else but shapes.

2337
05:28:09,049 --> 05:28:11,049
It's just shapes. Nothing else.

2338
05:28:11,049 --> 05:28:13,479
Why would I go inside out?

2339
05:28:13,479 --> 05:28:20,970
Outside in? That's what I was doing.

2340
05:28:20,970 --> 05:28:26,860
Why would you tell me to go inside

2341
05:28:26,860 --> 05:28:30,700
out? That's not right.

2342
05:28:30,700 --> 05:28:37,459
That's not right either.

2343
05:28:37,459 --> 05:28:40,729
That's not right either. That's right.

2344
05:28:40,729 --> 05:28:42,900
This is the one. This is the one.

2345
05:28:42,900 --> 05:28:44,900
Okay. Alright. Alright. Alright.

2346
05:28:44,900 --> 05:28:50,150
Heal. Fucking

2347
05:28:50,150 --> 05:28:52,150
heal. Heal.

2348
05:28:52,150 --> 05:29:03,540
Use it.

2349
05:29:03,540 --> 05:29:09,430
I don't want to do this again.

2350
05:29:09,430 --> 05:29:11,430
Okay.

2351
05:29:11,430 --> 05:29:13,430
I don't even care. I don't even want to look at it.

2352
05:29:13,430 --> 05:29:15,430
I'm going. I don't even want to look at it. I don't even care.

2353
05:29:15,430 --> 05:29:22,259
Where's my lighter?

2354
05:29:22,259 --> 05:29:27,830
Now what? Over here?

2355
05:29:27,830 --> 05:29:32,310
Okay. Now we have made it. Then go left.

2356
05:29:32,310 --> 05:29:39,990
Solve the puzzle to open the trap door.

2357
05:29:39,990 --> 05:29:41,990
Solve the puzzle. Solve the puzzle. Solve the puzzle.

2358
05:29:41,990 --> 05:29:43,990
Find the truth.

2359
05:29:43,990 --> 05:29:46,869
Okay.

2360
05:29:46,869 --> 05:29:52,759
Oh no. No.

2361
05:29:52,759 --> 05:29:54,759
No. No. Not these. Not one of these.

2362
05:29:54,759 --> 05:29:57,380
Wait.

2363
05:29:57,380 --> 05:29:59,380
It's a brainless

2364
05:29:59,380 --> 05:30:01,380
version. Thank god it's a brainless version.

2365
05:30:01,380 --> 05:30:06,759
Holy shit. I'm so happy

2366
05:30:06,759 --> 05:30:08,759
that this is just an absolute moron edition.

2367
05:30:08,759 --> 05:30:13,500
Where's this other piece of his face?

2368
05:30:13,500 --> 05:30:24,169
Where's his face?

2369
05:30:24,169 --> 05:30:26,470
Where's the piece of his face? Where's his other cheek?

2370
05:30:26,470 --> 05:30:33,639
There it is.

2371
05:30:33,639 --> 05:30:35,639
This is the wrong spot.

2372
05:30:35,639 --> 05:30:44,540
Okay. Hold on. Let me just get it right.

2373
05:30:44,540 --> 05:30:47,799
Okay. And then...

2374
05:30:47,799 --> 05:30:51,319
Saw on a wheelchair?

2375
05:30:51,319 --> 05:31:11,220
I don't remember. Is he?

2376
05:31:11,220 --> 05:31:20,700
Now we got to do... Where's this piece go?

2377
05:31:20,700 --> 05:31:23,000
Okay. Now we got to go right here.

2378
05:31:23,000 --> 05:31:25,689
And then...

2379
05:31:25,689 --> 05:31:33,939
His shoulder.

2380
05:31:33,939 --> 05:31:35,939
And then this piece goes over here.

2381
05:31:35,939 --> 05:31:37,939
No. It doesn't. Where's his shoulder go? Right here.

2382
05:31:37,939 --> 05:31:39,939
And then this piece... I don't know.

2383
05:31:39,939 --> 05:31:41,939
It's got like a...

2384
05:31:41,939 --> 05:32:03,189
I don't know.

2385
05:32:03,189 --> 05:32:05,189
And then this goes over here.

2386
05:32:05,189 --> 05:32:07,189
And this goes right here.

2387
05:32:07,189 --> 05:32:09,880
And this goes here.

2388
05:32:09,880 --> 05:32:12,439
It goes down here.

2389
05:32:12,439 --> 05:32:14,439
And this goes...

2390
05:32:14,439 --> 05:32:21,659
over here.

2391
05:32:21,659 --> 05:32:23,659
I win. Time to find the truth.

2392
05:32:23,659 --> 05:32:41,560
This is the end of the game. It has to be.

2393
05:32:41,560 --> 05:33:04,979
Four minutes for this.

2394
05:33:04,979 --> 05:33:07,799
Why'd you do that, man?

2395
05:33:15,099 --> 05:33:21,180
Wait. Who?

2396
05:33:21,180 --> 05:33:23,180
Who is supposed to do that?

2397
05:33:23,180 --> 05:33:27,340
Was he supposed to do this?

2398
05:33:27,340 --> 05:33:48,310
Get up. You're an asshole.

2399
05:33:48,310 --> 05:33:58,229
What do you think I'm doing?

2400
05:33:58,229 --> 05:34:00,229
Where's the...

2401
05:34:00,229 --> 05:34:02,229
Where's the power source?

2402
05:34:02,229 --> 05:34:12,790
It's complicated, Frank. Whatever your name is.

2403
05:34:12,790 --> 05:34:17,209
It's hard to do.

2404
05:34:17,209 --> 05:34:19,639
And then...

2405
05:34:26,540 --> 05:34:28,540
Why's everybody so rude?

2406
05:34:28,540 --> 05:34:37,689
I'm going as fast as I can.

2407
05:34:37,689 --> 05:34:41,779
Okay. And then this now

2408
05:34:41,779 --> 05:34:44,150
has to be changed.

2409
05:34:44,150 --> 05:34:48,180
Better than this.

2410
05:34:48,180 --> 05:34:51,380
This is not correct.

2411
05:34:51,380 --> 05:34:53,380
It's got to be...

2412
05:34:53,380 --> 05:34:58,380
Yep. You're alright.

2413
05:34:58,380 --> 05:35:00,869
Stay tight.

2414
05:35:00,869 --> 05:35:03,180
Hang tight there for a second.

2415
05:35:11,880 --> 05:35:14,119
Oh my god.

2416
05:35:14,119 --> 05:35:16,419
I should just shoot him.

2417
05:35:18,729 --> 05:35:20,729
This is a joke, right?

2418
05:35:20,729 --> 05:35:44,279
This is a joke?

2419
05:35:44,279 --> 05:35:46,279
This goes down.

2420
05:35:46,279 --> 05:35:48,279
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

2421
05:35:48,279 --> 05:35:58,139
This goes like this.

2422
05:35:58,139 --> 05:36:00,139
This connects up here.

2423
05:36:00,139 --> 05:36:04,979
This goes like this.

2424
05:36:04,979 --> 05:36:06,979
This one goes like this.

2425
05:36:06,979 --> 05:36:08,979
This one connects up here.

2426
05:36:08,979 --> 05:36:10,979
This one goes this way. This one connects up this way.

2427
05:36:10,979 --> 05:36:12,979

05:36:18,979 --> 05:36:20,979
This one connects up here.

2432
05:36:20,979 --> 05:36:23,349
This one connects like this.

2433
05:36:23,349 --> 05:36:25,349

Like this.

2443
05:37:06,840 --> 05:37:11,770
And then...

2444
05:37:11,770 --> 05:37:13,770

06:06:17,229 --> 06:06:22,349
Stains thanks for three dollars Jerma. I need some help. Okay, let's see if I can help you during lightning round

2681
06:06:22,790 --> 06:06:25,729
Recently, I've been having dreams with a guy from dirty jobs shows up

2682
06:06:26,470 --> 06:06:29,450
Swinging a ball peen hammer at me. I think I have micro

2683
06:06:30,509 --> 06:06:32,740
peen issues

2684
06:06:32,740 --> 06:06:41,279
Do you happen to know how does make it stop? Did you just make me say micro penis you did?

2685
06:06:42,180 --> 06:06:43,340
Congratulations

2686
06:06:43,340 --> 06:06:52,959
Professor plaid. Thanks for the five dollars. Don't use weapons in this game. Fists are much better. It's actually kind of real. I think you

2687
06:06:53,500 --> 06:07:00,779
Jam may get for the three dollars. Hi Jerma, but I'll be asleep by the time you get around to reading this

2688
06:07:00,779 --> 06:07:05,979
I'm in the UK, but I'll be watching the VOD when I can I'm in the last week of University

2689
06:07:06,259 --> 06:07:10,729
Your VODs have been keeping me sane the first time I've been able to watch live

2690
06:07:10,729 --> 06:07:13,970
So I thought I'd send you some appreciation for what little money I have to celebrate

2691
06:07:14,610 --> 06:07:20,630
Cue you talking about not giving money, but shut up. You've done more for me than you'll know. Thank you for being you

2692
06:07:20,889 --> 06:07:26,319
All right. Okay. All right. I will shut up. Make sure you don't get an F in pickleball like I did

2693
06:07:26,319 --> 06:07:31,409
I wish you the best. Good luck and

2694
06:07:32,529 --> 06:07:34,450
potential, you know, you know

2695
06:07:34,450 --> 06:07:39,830
preliminary congratulations on your passing of your

2696
06:07:40,430 --> 06:07:44,650
University year what is pickleball was the most fun sport in the world?

2697
06:07:45,330 --> 06:07:51,159
Snoozing coffee. Thanks for 250. I recently finished God of War 2018. It was so good. Did you ever play it off stream?

2698
06:07:51,200 --> 06:07:54,680
I did and then I got four or five hours in

2699
06:07:55,299 --> 06:07:59,990
Maybe I was a little more than that. It's probably like eight hours in and I stopped

2700
06:08:00,310 --> 06:08:04,740
But that first like two hours is one of the most fun

2701
06:08:04,740 --> 06:08:10,340
I think I've ever played in a video game that was single-player that first hour of God of War was like holy shit

2702
06:08:10,340 --> 06:08:12,459
This is insane. This is most insane game ever played

2703
06:08:12,979 --> 06:08:17,340
And then it was okay, and then it turns it was just a video game after that, but that's not a bad thing

2704
06:08:17,340 --> 06:08:19,459
It was a very very high quality video game

2705
06:08:19,900 --> 06:08:25,759
Like I would probably say that if I had a

2706
06:08:26,220 --> 06:08:31,979
Brain that actually functioned well on a daily basis that that would probably be one of the best single-player games that have come out in

2707
06:08:31,979 --> 06:08:32,900
a long time

2708
06:08:32,900 --> 06:08:41,000
Although I only have about 12 hours potentially of experience in a game. That's about twice that I

2709
06:08:41,400 --> 06:08:50,220
Can only imagine all the perfect joke opportunities to do an Irish accent the rage induced moments during Valkyrie fights in the story

2710
06:08:50,819 --> 06:08:53,069
Yeah

2711
06:08:53,069 --> 06:08:57,240
This is bad. I have to tell you this I got halfway

2712
06:08:57,240 --> 06:08:59,240
I got like 12 hours in the game

2713
06:08:59,439 --> 06:09:07,119
And then I just stopped playing for like a couple months went by and then I just read every spoiler on like the Wikipedia page

2714
06:09:07,799 --> 06:09:17,689
Sorry, but whatever it's still cool. It's still a really cool game. I

2715
06:09:19,900 --> 06:09:23,819
Found my perfect keyboard low profile and quiet. It's 170 bucks

2716
06:09:23,819 --> 06:09:30,299
I have difficulty justifying an investment like that help get an Amazon basics fucking $10 keyboard save yourself

2717
06:09:30,900 --> 06:09:40,580
1700 percent wait is that correct maybe an Amazon basics fucking $9 keyboard who cares

2718
06:09:40,979 --> 06:09:53,419
They all do the same thing good keyboards are worth it

2719
06:09:53,419 --> 06:09:58,259
Yeah, but you could just get a $9 Amazon basics keyboard and fucking save $1,000 or whatever it was

2720
06:09:59,020 --> 06:10:05,380
Ex whimsical moose. Thanks for two feet. By the way, I'm a hypocrite asshole lying a fuckface. I have a course here

2721
06:10:05,700 --> 06:10:07,700
Listen to this you ready for this one. Oh

2722
06:10:08,040 --> 06:10:12,319
Whoa Amazon basic keyboard. What what's that? That's

2723
06:10:12,880 --> 06:10:15,189
That's not an Amazon

2724
06:10:15,549 --> 06:10:18,709
Basics keyboard anymore. Is it it's a course here fucking keyboard? I got it

2725
06:10:18,709 --> 06:10:20,750
I got the course here. I'm the one that I dumped the drink on

2726
06:10:20,750 --> 06:10:25,549
Yeah, I got that same one because it was my favorite keyboard. I got it. I cracked get an Amazon basics keyboard the $9

2727
06:10:26,270 --> 06:10:33,459
Thank you ex whimsical moose for the 250. Hello, Jeremiah first donation. I'm 28 years old

2728
06:10:33,979 --> 06:10:39,630
Happy why was I just gonna say happy birthday like today? Wait. No, I'm fucking that up

2729
06:10:39,990 --> 06:10:44,110
Just want to say not all your fans are these dang zoomers

2730
06:10:44,150 --> 06:10:48,049
I didn't grow up with you and you haven't saved my life

2731
06:10:48,229 --> 06:10:51,150
But you're one of the few e-clowns from when I was 19 or 20

2732
06:10:51,189 --> 06:10:57,479
There's still watchable and even funnier than you used to be even if you never beat stalker shadow of Chernobyl. Keep it up

2733
06:10:58,200 --> 06:10:59,439
also play

2734
06:10:59,439 --> 06:11:06,340
Exanima you played it in 2015. So I know you own it and it's updated a ton since then you can be a wizard now

2735
06:11:06,340 --> 06:11:14,869
I made a video on examina. Maybe I'll go back to it one day. Put it on the list

2736
06:11:15,349 --> 06:11:22,189
It's at least one person's birthday today. Yeah, they've already we've already seen them

2737
06:11:22,189 --> 06:11:23,830
they've already been

2738
06:11:23,830 --> 06:11:28,240
Here play that instead of finishing saw

2739
06:11:29,380 --> 06:11:33,169
that was a

2740
06:11:33,169 --> 06:11:35,169
common rider based

2741
06:11:35,409 --> 06:11:42,680
But ex whimsical moose gave 250. I didn't even read this

2742
06:11:43,159 --> 06:11:46,810
Hey, Jeremiah, I love this game and it's sequel for how funny bad it is

2743
06:11:47,130 --> 06:11:50,689
Also, you always tell us to keep safe, but I was wondering how you Kim and Otto are doing

2744
06:11:51,049 --> 06:11:53,970
Also, I'm hype about this weekend streams and stay safe chat

2745
06:11:55,650 --> 06:12:00,939
We're doing good. We'll see how it goes here over the next few weeks

2746
06:12:01,740 --> 06:12:03,180
Nevada

2747
06:12:03,180 --> 06:12:06,500
Stay-at-home order in Nevada is gone

2748
06:12:07,180 --> 06:12:09,180
We've entered phase one of

2749
06:12:10,060 --> 06:12:11,220
reopening

2750
06:12:11,220 --> 06:12:18,119
Hopefully it's not gonna cause a big problem. I know some restaurants are starting to open up again a little bit

2751
06:12:18,680 --> 06:12:21,040
Some other businesses are starting to open

2752
06:12:22,000 --> 06:12:25,799
Casinos are all still closed. The strip is still closed and it will be probably for a pretty long time

2753
06:12:26,520 --> 06:12:28,759
Can't imagine any of those properties are gonna open up until

2754
06:12:30,000 --> 06:12:32,950
June July

2755
06:12:33,389 --> 06:12:35,389
Who knows it depends on how this goes?

2756
06:12:35,709 --> 06:12:43,340
Yeah, we're we're doing all right. We're doing just fine

2757
06:12:44,060 --> 06:12:50,319
Trying to stay as safe as possible try to take care of each other here of Otto, obviously

2758
06:12:50,840 --> 06:12:53,590
Yeah, we're doing good

2759
06:12:53,590 --> 06:12:56,360
pump

2760
06:12:56,360 --> 06:13:01,880
Punk Pikachu. Thanks for the four dollars. Jeremy yesterday at Walmart. They played I'm Han Solo

2761
06:13:02,000 --> 06:13:04,680
And I felt the need to tell you how famous you've gotten

2762
06:13:05,439 --> 06:13:09,909
Anyways, love your streams. They make me laugh no matter how much time has passed a

2763
06:13:12,200 --> 06:13:22,020
Fame wait, I didn't make the hun solo song. They played I'm hun, but I didn't that's not my song. I

2764
06:13:25,290 --> 06:13:28,169
danced to it like

2765
06:13:28,450 --> 06:13:30,650
three years after it was a meme and

2766
06:13:31,720 --> 06:13:38,549
Like after five youtubers made jokes about it. I think I was I was a little late to that party

2767
06:13:38,790 --> 06:13:45,950
No need to be so modest. All right, fine. I wrote the song. No, I didn't that's how I can't fucking say that

2768
06:13:45,950 --> 06:13:47,669
That's bad. I didn't do that

2769
06:13:47,669 --> 06:13:53,279
It's like I didn't and like somebody was like, well, I what if you what if you fucking actually wrote it?

2770
06:13:53,279 --> 06:13:55,279
And you were sitting here right now and you're listening to this asshole

2771
06:13:55,639 --> 06:13:57,799
Hey Wembley TTV. Thanks for the 250

2772
06:13:57,799 --> 06:14:01,080
I really hope that I'm never put it in a saw like contraption and

2773
06:14:01,810 --> 06:14:06,250
Jerma has to take over to save my life. I'd rather take my own chances. Thank you

2774
06:14:06,610 --> 06:14:13,159
Well, I opened the door and shot the guy in the last one. So I mean that you do it. There's a good point there

2775
06:14:13,680 --> 06:14:19,520
Hey, mostly toasted toast. Thanks for three dollars. I'm starting to feel like this game isn't about cutting things

2776
06:14:20,639 --> 06:14:26,400
Make me home. Thanks for three dollars Jerma. It's been forever since I watched live therefore

2777
06:14:26,400 --> 06:14:31,119
It's been forever since I've given bits. I must make the opportunity count. I will

2778
06:14:31,759 --> 06:14:37,090
And it's a dad. It's a blank to continue recording this message. Cheer another hundred bits

2779
06:14:37,569 --> 06:14:47,439
And shit will see if you end up putting another another 250 in there. Hey one blondie. Thanks for the nine dollars and ninety cents

2780
06:14:47,439 --> 06:14:52,979
I'm making a D&D wizard. Do you want to name him? He likes illusions. Sure

2781
06:15:03,860 --> 06:15:06,619
see-through s e a

2782
06:15:07,099 --> 06:15:14,459
No space t h r o u u

2783
06:15:15,779 --> 06:15:17,779
Ostrich

2784
06:15:27,069 --> 06:15:32,569
It's fucking good, I mean terrible

2785
06:15:36,259 --> 06:15:39,060
Okay, so but so see-through is terrible

2786
06:15:39,099 --> 06:15:45,220
But hell scream is the greatest character ever made and the best name ever made ever for any character ever

2787
06:15:45,860 --> 06:15:55,889
Okay, hell scream

2788
06:15:56,689 --> 06:16:01,090
See-through. All right, it's pretty bad. It's bad. It's worse than hell scream, but not that much worse

2789
06:16:01,090 --> 06:16:03,930
I would put up next to each other and you wouldn't build it would be hard to tell

2790
06:16:04,409 --> 06:16:08,169
Hey BS. Hey

06:18:06,569 --> 06:18:13,209
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What did I just do? It was a Simpsons joke. That's from the Simpsons

Hey anything else show official. Thanks for the $15 German. Do you think that you'll look like Neil Breen when you become older?

2813
06:18:26,509 --> 06:18:34,830
What do you think?

2814
06:18:34,830 --> 06:18:41,889
This doesn't this I don't think I don't think this link actually works

2815
06:18:49,080 --> 06:18:54,759
Link I don't think this link is a correct link. It's just it's just a discord and then like a bunch of numbers

2816
06:18:54,759 --> 06:18:56,759
I don't think this is accurate. I don't think this is correct

2817
06:18:57,360 --> 06:19:08,130
Yeah, sorry. I don't I can't I'd like to just type in his name. Let's just do that Neil Breen

2818
06:19:11,259 --> 06:19:19,130
No, no, I don't think so. No, no, no, no, I had to look like this now. So when I'm older

2819
06:19:19,630 --> 06:19:22,060
No, maybe somebody else

2820
06:19:22,099 --> 06:19:32,979
Thanks for the $15 though hair air of the moon. Thanks for the $5. Will you play saw to after this?

2821
06:19:32,979 --> 06:19:39,080
I don't know. I don't I don't think so, but I could get yelled at to do it

2822
06:19:39,080 --> 06:19:41,080
We could think of you like the saw

2823
06:19:41,720 --> 06:19:48,840
Saw crew. I don't know. I'm sure it'll happen. Hey s10w slow update. Thanks for this 250 German

2824
06:19:48,840 --> 06:19:54,400
I was having some trouble paying for your only fans. So think of this donation as my month's payment. Well, that's

2825
06:19:55,360 --> 06:19:57,580
That's hilarious considering it's $30 a month

2826
06:19:58,159 --> 06:20:00,880
Please enable my account again so I can use the new see the new pics

2827
06:20:00,880 --> 06:20:05,880
Honestly, this stuff you do is way extreme way extreme for only 250. Anyways, peace and love whatever

2828
06:20:06,520 --> 06:20:12,259
Thanks for the okay the saw squad. Hey BS 88. It's in a unit. Thanks for the $5

2829
06:20:12,259 --> 06:20:15,939
It's amazing how funny you can make a shitty game. Cheers with hilarious morning. Good morning

2830
06:20:16,459 --> 06:20:22,110
You gotta be you gotta be in Australia, New Zealand, UK

2831
06:20:22,750 --> 06:20:34,580
Asia where that's far. It's the five dolls. Hey, thank you Zion swaz. Thanks for the five dollars

2832
06:20:34,580 --> 06:20:36,419
Yo, I don't got a lot of money

2833
06:20:36,419 --> 06:20:41,540
Sorry, but here's five for bringing joy to everyone during these hard times streamer. Anyway, the first

2834
06:20:42,479 --> 06:20:44,919
In second halo games are now on Steam

2835
06:20:44,919 --> 06:20:50,880
I know you said you'd never play more but their campaigns would be better than a shit co-op reach stream on the hardest difficulty for no

2836
06:20:50,880 --> 06:20:51,680
reason

2837
06:20:51,680 --> 06:20:54,599
Baby, if the curse is too strong though

2838
06:20:54,599 --> 06:20:59,080
I at least recommend any halo OST for when we need BG music for a stream

2839
06:20:59,360 --> 06:21:09,520
Or at least these serene songs playing for the Silent Hill and fable OSTs. I don't know why we do that. Wait, is this like

2840
06:21:11,959 --> 06:21:13,959
I have stopped

2841
06:21:14,119 --> 06:21:16,490
Doing that have you noticed

2842
06:21:17,840 --> 06:21:24,159
Recently games have come up. It's like oh easy normal hard insane and I used to be like, I have to play on hard

2843
06:21:24,159 --> 06:21:29,720
I'm a live streamer. I have to what are the other streamers played on insane mode? Oh, oh biting nails. I

2844
06:21:30,520 --> 06:21:34,040
Guess I have to know I don't care. I don't fucking normal. I don't give a shit

2845
06:21:34,479 --> 06:21:39,279
like if you be the game on insane and like

2846
06:21:40,040 --> 06:21:43,799
Other streamer be the game on insane. I'm good. I'm glad I hope you fucking win. I

2847
06:21:44,880 --> 06:21:51,040
At this I don't care. I'm not picking insane on saw. I'm not gonna do hard mode on

2848
06:21:52,029 --> 06:21:58,750
Halo OST. No, whatever. Well, that's the you target, but very very that's not the name of the game

2849
06:22:01,299 --> 06:22:09,060
Okay, right. I'm stupid. Hey gay wizard. Thanks for the five dollars, Jeremy

2850
06:22:09,060 --> 06:22:11,900
I want to say that I've been a fan since like 2014

2851
06:22:11,900 --> 06:22:16,150
But this is surprisingly my first time watching a live stream. Welcome, even though the game sucked

2852
06:22:16,349 --> 06:22:18,790
It was a blast watching you being part of chat

2853
06:22:19,310 --> 06:22:22,529
Your humor has gotten me through some dark days and I just want to say thank you

2854
06:22:22,529 --> 06:22:31,139
I wish I could donate more but anyways gay rights, baby. Yeah, I don't you don't have to give me money

2855
06:22:31,139 --> 06:22:39,200
I know I say this a lot but you you don't have it's not don't worry about it

2856
06:22:39,200 --> 06:22:42,159
I really hope some of you guys are not

2857
06:22:42,759 --> 06:22:48,330
Like saving up money to give me on stream. I hope that's not the case

2858
06:22:48,849 --> 06:22:52,450
They carry yourselves. They carry you shut up and take the money

2859
06:22:53,290 --> 06:23:05,459
I'm gonna but every so often I'm gonna make sure that I'm gonna tell you this I spent my food stamps on bits for you

2860
06:23:06,319 --> 06:23:07,680
Don't do that

2861
06:23:07,680 --> 06:23:15,509
Use it up eat food. But thank you though. I appreciate it refund all the donations then

2862
06:23:21,900 --> 06:23:26,619
Well, you guys think I have a button here that will just I press it and it just

2863
06:23:27,020 --> 06:23:32,560
Deposits all the money back to every human that's ever given money to the stream. That's no there are no refunds

2864
06:23:32,959 --> 06:23:38,080
Give me my money back. No, there's no refunds

2865
06:23:38,200 --> 06:23:45,840
It's in the twitch term services you buy bits and use them bits are consumed by the stream or the eats them and shitty shits out money

2866
06:23:45,840 --> 06:23:56,200
That's how it works. Hey goo berry juice. Thanks with three dollars. Hey funk King

2867
06:23:56,759 --> 06:24:08,560
What's with that? Why are people saying funk King? Is that a way to say?

2868
06:24:09,279 --> 06:24:10,240
fucking

2869
06:24:10,240 --> 06:24:17,830
Whatever it is, whatever

2870
06:24:18,029 --> 06:24:19,830
Hey funk King

2871
06:24:19,830 --> 06:24:22,000
Man, this game sucks, huh? I

2872
06:24:22,240 --> 06:24:24,439
Don't really have anything to add to that

2873
06:24:24,439 --> 06:24:29,520
So just thought I remind everyone of the good thing to come out of the saw franchise. What a classic

2874
06:24:30,759 --> 06:24:39,459
Wait, is this like a movie clip of like somebody getting that they had ripped off? Oh, I've

2875
06:24:41,040 --> 06:24:45,580
This is a it is a classic it is

2876
06:24:48,509 --> 06:25:02,770
Hold on, you know, let's uh this way it is a classic

2877
06:25:04,069 --> 06:25:11,680
Game skip

2878
06:25:20,159 --> 06:25:30,889
The video is so funny cuz like how did he fall down I want to play a little game

2879
06:25:32,250 --> 06:25:34,250
Like the whole bike explode

2880
06:25:36,330 --> 06:25:38,689
Like just disintegrates underneath

2881
06:25:43,020 --> 06:25:47,099
Like so how wheeling in and doing this shit you want to play a little game

2882
06:25:47,180 --> 06:25:53,900
You

2883
06:25:57,209 --> 06:26:01,880
Do that for the green screen I get like a tricycle

2884
06:26:03,400 --> 06:26:08,459
What a classic great stream. Nonetheless, I can always count on you

2885
06:26:09,119 --> 06:26:16,020
Chat take nothing and make it funny. You can always count on you chat to take nothing and make it funny

2886
06:26:16,020 --> 06:26:22,169
What do you mean chat? Well me I do that too. Don't I I do that. That's I do that sometimes

2887
06:26:22,650 --> 06:26:29,479
Hey Tobias, thanks for the thousand bits long time follower first time donator. Welcome and thank you

2888
06:26:29,959 --> 06:26:33,560
Today's my birthday. So we have a bunch of fucking birthdays. Everyone said that whose birthday was it?

2889
06:26:34,040 --> 06:26:38,240
It's been a bummer in quarantine, but your streams have been keeping me afloat in these trying times

2890
06:26:39,080 --> 06:26:41,080
Thanks for being a bright part of the crazy world

2891
06:26:41,319 --> 06:26:48,049
You've been make you better make Chad a birthday cake with the easy-bake oven. I don't even know what's in that box

2892
06:26:48,049 --> 06:26:51,240
I know this I think 12 recipes

2893
06:26:51,759 --> 06:26:57,240
That streams gonna suck by the way, I just I need to make sure I've laid that concrete down for you

2894
06:26:57,799 --> 06:26:59,799
I'm just going to make

2895
06:27:00,540 --> 06:27:05,549
Candies and cakes and pizzas and shit in an easy-bake oven. I don't know

2896
06:27:05,549 --> 06:27:13,000
I want to make sure you guys aren't expecting anything from that that could be birdhouse stream too and then eat it

2897
06:27:13,000 --> 06:27:22,229
No, I won't eat it disgusting. I'm way above that. But anyways, thank you for the thousand bits and happy birthday

2898
06:27:22,229 --> 06:27:29,729
I will make a birthday themed

2899
06:27:30,290 --> 06:27:36,500
Cake thing. What are you gonna do while the food is baking? Holy shit. I don't even think about that

2900
06:27:36,500 --> 06:27:43,409
I don't know like jumping jacks push ups and stuff like stretches. I'm gonna be careful. I don't like forget that it's in there

2901
06:27:44,590 --> 06:27:47,639
That might happen. All right, I gotta be careful. I got to have like a

2902
06:27:48,200 --> 06:27:55,069
Okay. All right. Hey tree fiddy. Thanks for the five dollars. Thank you German for everything on my birthday

2903
06:27:55,069 --> 06:27:56,990
You were the only person I felt like I had

2904
06:27:56,990 --> 06:28:02,770
Having you around made things not suck so much. It seems like that's the case every time you stream. It's the thanks, dude

2905
06:28:02,770 --> 06:28:08,330
I appreciate your drive and your dedication to the community. I wish words could describe how much you've made an impact on my life

2906
06:28:08,330 --> 06:28:10,689
From the bottom of my heart. Thank you and love you

2907
06:28:11,409 --> 06:28:21,340
That means a lot but I've mentioned this before and I want to mention it again

2908
06:28:21,340 --> 06:28:32,349
I really hope that you can take the steps necessary to try to improve your life and hope things get better

2909
06:28:32,909 --> 06:28:43,599
because I'm just a streamer on the internet and although I can

2910
06:28:44,279 --> 06:28:50,400
Hopefully be here to have fun and have a good time with the community. I can't necessarily

2911
06:28:51,360 --> 06:29:00,979
Fix any problems that anybody has and obviously I know that people aren't asking me to do that

2912
06:29:01,439 --> 06:29:04,509
And that's never something that was no one's ever like hey, by the way

2913
06:29:04,509 --> 06:29:08,389
I what I know that what this advice questions and stuff like that

2914
06:29:08,389 --> 06:29:19,540
But I just hope that you can find something else that can make you happy as well as me as well as this community because

2915
06:29:20,279 --> 06:29:22,759
That means that you're gonna get healthier

2916
06:29:22,759 --> 06:29:34,560
You guys are really feeding his God complex, but like again, I say like I say it again

2917
06:29:34,599 --> 06:29:36,599
I'm just a guy on the internet

2918
06:29:37,000 --> 06:29:43,040
That's just me. I'm just an e-clown and we're in an e-clown community

2919
06:29:43,400 --> 06:29:51,130
And I can't necessarily help anybody with their problems and I don't necessarily want to

2920
06:29:51,529 --> 06:30:05,860
I'm gonna be you know, let's get the honesty out here because I don't know I get questions a lot about hey

2921
06:30:05,860 --> 06:30:10,119
What about this? What about that? What about this? And I don't really know it's I don't really have good answers

2922
06:30:10,119 --> 06:30:13,500
A lot of the time I don't want to put people in the wrong path

2923
06:30:14,139 --> 06:30:16,299
Or tell people something that might not even be true

2924
06:30:16,819 --> 06:30:23,020
Because if you put a lot of weight in the things that I say I don't want to be like well

2925
06:30:23,020 --> 06:30:26,060
This is how you do it. This is how would I do because I've you know in the past

2926
06:30:26,340 --> 06:30:29,060
I've tried to give some decent advice as best as I could

2927
06:30:29,700 --> 06:30:31,869
But my advice is not really that good

2928
06:30:32,189 --> 06:30:37,919
It's not adequate. I don't think or what some of you guys might necessarily need

2929
06:30:38,479 --> 06:30:44,540
Remember should I change the dosage of my medication? I'll call your doctor

2930
06:30:49,459 --> 06:30:51,459
You should call to your doctor

2931
06:30:54,459 --> 06:30:56,979
So I'm nothing of a psychologist myself

2932
06:31:00,930 --> 06:31:07,099
Don't tell me what to do, but I

2933
06:31:08,500 --> 06:31:11,659
Obviously everybody in this community that's been a part of this community

2934
06:31:11,659 --> 06:31:15,060
If you just even if you watch for 10 minutes, I wish you the best of health

2935
06:31:15,060 --> 06:31:19,750
I do and I hope you take the steps necessary to get there

2936
06:31:20,090 --> 06:31:24,250
But just be careful putting a lot of weight in

2937
06:31:25,169 --> 06:31:27,169
Somebody like an online entertainer

2938
06:31:27,169 --> 06:31:32,029
Because I might say something that might not even be good enough. It might not be real

2939
06:31:32,029 --> 06:31:38,090
It might be something that's not the best advice to give somebody and if you take that completely and you

2940
06:31:38,169 --> 06:31:39,689
Absorb all of it

2941
06:31:39,689 --> 06:31:47,060
It's maybe something that would should never should have been said in the first place. You know, I mean, did you eat ass? Yes

2942
06:31:47,580 --> 06:31:56,860
Irma is not an expert at anything even streaming, right?

2943
06:32:00,340 --> 06:32:04,119
Enjoy your parasites what from eating ass

2944
06:32:06,740 --> 06:32:10,540
Shit wait, did I say to do that? I did did I? Oh

2945
06:32:14,819 --> 06:32:21,990
No, don't do that don't do that. Oh my god, that person's disgusting, but they could be real is that real?

2946
06:32:22,389 --> 06:32:28,590
All right. I've never I've never eaten ass again. I never did. Why would you who does that? Somebody does it's gross

2947
06:32:28,590 --> 06:32:34,310
I do who does nobody does disgusting move on. Nobody's I don't do that. I really don't I swear to God 100%

2948
06:32:34,310 --> 06:32:38,270
No jokes. Don't do that. Hey creepy teeth. Thanks for the $5

2949
06:32:38,790 --> 06:32:42,970
Irma have you ever thought about playing the Batman games? I feel like it'd be a fun stream

2950
06:32:42,970 --> 06:32:48,209
I'm not sure anything can ever top I can't play Batman games because I played the ultimate Batman game where you could ghost ride

2951
06:32:48,290 --> 06:32:50,290
the Batmobile into a wall

2952
06:32:50,569 --> 06:32:53,409
I'm not sure I could ever top that any of the Batman game could do it

2953
06:33:03,159 --> 06:33:05,040
Let's get the credits on here

2954
06:33:05,040 --> 06:33:13,180
Why not? Right? It was a shitload of subs. You'll see a shitload of names

2955
06:33:13,560 --> 06:33:16,880
They're gonna fly by very fast because there was a lot of people that was subbed today

2956
06:33:17,680 --> 06:33:24,979
It is the lots of community subs and lots of just resubs and new subs. It's a lot of people

2957
06:33:25,500 --> 06:33:28,500
Good morning. I just read that person's name first time ever

2958
06:33:29,380 --> 06:33:37,740
Thanks guys. Seriously. It's a slow lightning around. We're almost done. It's been like 30 minutes

2959
06:33:37,819 --> 06:33:39,819
That's a quick. Okay 30 minutes

2960
06:33:41,040 --> 06:33:44,360
Usually I said it for like 40 to an hour and the 40 to an hour

2961
06:33:45,159 --> 06:33:48,459
Hey goiki. Thanks for the $5 to give credit where credit is due

2962
06:33:48,459 --> 06:33:52,659
This game is pretty faithful to the movie just like the saw puzzles in the movie. This game is stupid and tedious

2963
06:33:53,299 --> 06:34:02,540
Hey Tom sup. Thanks for the $5 streamer man a little over eight years ago

2964
06:34:02,540 --> 06:34:07,119
I was finishing middle school and I found your channel looking for tips for playing Scout glad you took them now

2965
06:34:07,119 --> 06:34:13,479
I'm graduating college. I'm watching ever since I still suck at Scout your work in the community around it mean a lot

2966
06:34:13,680 --> 06:34:20,040
It's been one of my few constants this whole time looking forward to the easy-bake stream more than my virtual graduation that morning

2967
06:34:20,240 --> 06:34:24,200
If you are enjoying what you do because we sure do I am

2968
06:34:24,959 --> 06:34:28,200
I'm gonna continue to do so as long as it's still fun

2969
06:34:28,200 --> 06:34:32,599
I don't have a time frame on when I I'm gonna stop doing it this ever

2970
06:34:33,119 --> 06:34:39,689
Because when it's not fun anymore, that's when I'm done. That's the only fucking thing I care about if it's not fun

2971
06:34:39,689 --> 06:34:43,240
I'm done. You'll know you'll know when I'm you'll know

2972
06:34:43,639 --> 06:34:45,639
When it's time for me to retire

2973
06:34:46,080 --> 06:34:50,669
Because it's I you'll know that I'm just I want to take a step back. It's not really that fun for me anymore

2974
06:34:51,389 --> 06:34:56,270
Based honest now. What do you say?

2975
06:34:56,869 --> 06:35:00,950
Hedonist he didn't what is that? What does that word mean? I think I should know what this means. He didn't

2976
06:35:01,590 --> 06:35:05,159
Person who believes that the pursuit of pleasure is the most important thing in life

2977
06:35:06,040 --> 06:35:14,779
I mean, I just don't want to like pretend on stream. I don't want to like fake. Well, I'm having a good time. I

2978
06:35:15,639 --> 06:35:20,880
Can't do that shit you think I could sit here for more than six to eight hours and like pretend to have a good time

2979
06:35:20,880 --> 06:35:22,880
No, I in ten minutes. I'd be like I'd be gone

2980
06:35:23,520 --> 06:35:29,560
No way you pretend to be bad at games. Yeah

2981
06:35:30,400 --> 06:35:33,880
He's exhausted. He's it's a geez. Oh, it's exhausting

2982
06:35:34,880 --> 06:35:41,659
If I'm not having a good time on streams

2983
06:35:43,099 --> 06:35:51,060
Consistently and I'm getting I don't know. I don't have a plan. I just I didn't have a plan eight years ago

2984
06:35:51,099 --> 06:35:55,259
I didn't have a plan ten years ago. I didn't have a plan twenty years ago for well like any of this shit

2985
06:35:55,459 --> 06:36:01,880
I'm just still here doing it and that's the way it is and it seems to have worked out. All right

2986
06:36:02,599 --> 06:36:12,650
We'll see and it's shocking to me that people have been here for ten years. He's the just like the Roman Empire

2987
06:36:12,689 --> 06:36:15,150
Yeah, that's the Roman Empire crumbled, right?

2988
06:36:15,810 --> 06:36:21,759
What happened to the Roman Empire? Okay, you want to be I'm a hedonist from the Roman Empire. What happened to the Roman Empire?

2989
06:36:22,279 --> 06:36:28,669
But how's my story end? I stopped having fun. Oh

2990
06:36:29,430 --> 06:36:44,439
The Romans are extinct. It was a volcano in barbarians barbarians attacked. Oh

2991
06:36:46,909 --> 06:36:54,080
You're not the Roman Empire

2992
06:36:54,520 --> 06:37:00,419
Another channel is going to raid us to death. Oh

2993
06:37:02,729 --> 06:37:06,360
well

2994
06:37:06,360 --> 06:37:10,639
Eco mania. All right. All right, we're done. We're done. We're done. We're done. We're done

2995
06:37:11,080 --> 06:37:14,310
Hey Wembley TTV. Thanks for the 250

2996
06:37:14,310 --> 06:37:21,490
This game is pretty much a mobile game with all these puzzles and lackluster combat just add in lives and pointless non-skipping phone adverts

2997
06:37:22,209 --> 06:37:27,209
The most ironic thing about all this Konami got the rights for the series to publish this

2998
06:37:27,729 --> 06:37:34,209
So, you know, they did a good job looking after the horror titles after the 2010 looking at you Silent Hill series

2999
06:37:34,330 --> 06:37:38,290
That's been turned into a Chinko machine and it's dead since PT

3000
06:37:38,849 --> 06:37:45,479
No, Konami makes more money from one person sitting at one of their slot machines than a hundred people buying games

3001
06:37:46,000 --> 06:37:48,439
They figured that out a long time ago

3002
06:37:50,040 --> 06:37:56,549
Fortunate hey River Roria. Thanks for the 250. Hey, mr. 900 800 500. The stream was good

3003
06:37:56,830 --> 06:38:00,990
Thanks for the comedy and the humor and the jokes Hickman 2 is one of my favorite games

3004
06:38:00,990 --> 06:38:03,209
I'm so excited for that stream. Also, by the way

3005
06:38:04,270 --> 06:38:11,500
Here is something here

3006
06:38:11,819 --> 06:38:21,040
All right, that's the sound effect. I think that's that's how they're made their exit. Hey rip Alex Trebek

3007
06:38:21,040 --> 06:38:23,720
Thanks for the $5. Hey, Jeremy, if I consider getting a standing desk

3008
06:38:23,720 --> 06:38:28,919
I know standing can be a bit of a meme, but it helps for stretching and not sitting all day, which does suck

3009
06:38:29,439 --> 06:38:36,819
Xoxoxo stinky poopoo epic read it. Okay, nice ending. I'm glad you gave me the TLDR here at the end

3010
06:38:38,180 --> 06:38:42,759
Well, I don't have a standing desk because I just got

3011
06:38:43,520 --> 06:38:45,840
last year a brand new desk

3012
06:38:46,639 --> 06:38:48,639
very nice and I

3013
06:38:49,040 --> 06:38:54,720
It would be a shame to have to spend the money that I did on this nice desk and then replace it with another

3014
06:38:54,880 --> 06:38:56,520
expensive desk

3015
06:38:56,520 --> 06:39:03,959
But what I could do is I could get one of those

3016
06:39:04,439 --> 06:39:06,439
but standing I I

3017
06:39:06,520 --> 06:39:10,040
Don't really like standing and doing stuff. I it doesn't I

3018
06:39:10,680 --> 06:39:14,959
Move around too much. I fidget all the time and I would be gone for a second. I come back

3019
06:39:14,959 --> 06:39:17,479
I'd be I don't really like standing up to standing still

3020
06:39:18,279 --> 06:39:21,029
What I does it doesn't really work for me

3021
06:39:21,349 --> 06:39:23,779
But your health I know

3022
06:39:24,060 --> 06:39:33,770
I'm getting this figured out. Don't worry. I'm figuring it. I'll get it. I'm gonna get it figured out. Don't worry

3023
06:39:34,290 --> 06:39:39,860
Thanks to $5. Hey on zeroic. Thanks with 300 bits

3024
06:39:39,860 --> 06:39:43,819
I'm giving you bits. So you have to go through one more bit message. I'm just that evil

3025
06:39:44,459 --> 06:39:46,180
You're not the last one

3026
06:39:46,180 --> 06:39:48,610
Appreciate that evil money

3027
06:39:49,610 --> 06:39:51,330
Thank you Pritzla

3028
06:39:51,330 --> 06:39:54,930

Happy birthday. Yeah, happy birthday all the quarantine birthdays

From what somewhere in the around the end of February

3033
06:40:14,000 --> 06:40:19,279

3034
06:40:19,759 --> 06:40:21,360

3036
06:40:31,560 --> 06:40:35,520
I recently lost my 4.0 in high school in the last semester

3037
06:40:35,520 --> 06:40:41,020
It really mattered this whole corona virus dealio and distance learning have been really taxing on my mental health

3038
06:40:41,400 --> 06:40:44,520
One of those thanks for being here through it and cheering me up when I really need it

3039
06:40:45,159 --> 06:40:48,740
Generally, you're generally one of the best guys on this platform. I thank you

3040
06:40:50,599 --> 06:40:57,200
Incredibly humbled that you would even say something like that. It's like a five hundred thousand people that stream on Twitter more than that probably

Omega birthdays. I showed the fire watch video to my parents. They didn't think it was funny

3064
06:43:40,110 --> 06:43:44,250
What the fuck is wrong with them? Don't show your parents that video

3065
06:43:44,270 --> 06:43:49,950
Why would you do what what's your context to show your parents a video of a guy naked on the internet?

3066
06:43:50,389 --> 06:43:57,639
What's what what's your context there? Hey mom and dad look hey, I got this a naked guy, okay

My water heater is broken and I had to take a bath from five pots of boiling water mixed with cold tap water

3112
06:49:12,840 --> 06:49:15,080
If you play Kingdom Hearts on stream

06:49:15,639 --> 06:49:17,560
I'm sorry

3114
06:49:17,560 --> 06:49:26,939
To hear that that sounds terrible and no five pots of boiling water. You're gonna be careful with that shit. I

3115
06:49:29,529 --> 06:49:35,250
Imagine you holding that pot of boiling water with the steam coming out of it and just like oh shit easy easy

3116
06:49:35,250 --> 06:49:46,819
