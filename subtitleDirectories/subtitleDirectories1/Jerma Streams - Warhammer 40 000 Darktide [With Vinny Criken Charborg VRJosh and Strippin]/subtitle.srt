00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:17,559
Hey, what's up? How you doing? Welcome to a fun little afternoon. Today we are going to be playing

2
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:25,829
Warhammer 40,000 Dark Tide. It is a sponsored stream, so thank you Warhammer for the sponsor.

3
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:38,340
Drops are on if you want to participate. Drops are on for the game. This is currently the beta.

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,619
You pre-order the game right now. You'll get access to the beta before the game comes out on the 30th.

5
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:58,600
We got some friends in here. We've got Vinny, we've got Kraiken, and we've got Charborg.

6
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:08,359
I think it's gonna be a pretty fun time. But again, thank you Warhammer for the sponsor. Let's get

7
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:19,129
started pulling up the YouTube voice. You know, let's see how they're doing. And then like us

8
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,810
calling the meeting exactly at the moment you were about to die and you run into the room.

9
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:29,370
Yeah. How the fuck did that even happen? I have no idea, dude. That was such a fun session. I

10
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,689
really like want to play more. What, the, the, the Among Us section? Yeah. Yeah, we were just

11
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,769
talking about it. It was so good. It was really fun. But like, I don't know, I, dude, I put,

12
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:48,180
I put all my VR away. I, I just like, no, I just like put it away. Salvation Army. It just, it

13
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,420
takes up so much space. It's just such a huge thing. It just like, it turns your whole room

14
00:01:52,420 --> 00:02:02,260
into a different room. Right. That's the rule. Yeah. All right. Well, me and Kraik and we'll

15
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,900
just do Among Us again, I guess. That's fine. You guys can watch it on their streams. It'd be fun.

16
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:14,500
Snot has requested to join. It's not one of you guys. This might know. I don't think that's any of

17
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:25,460
us. Did I get an invite? I did invite ice cream. I think you could also right click and join too.

18
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,699
Oh, can I just, is it from like the mission terminal?

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,840
Escape menu. Oh, in this team, your friend, your friend, please. Oh, there it is. Okay.

20
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,199
Snot Fondler has joined the match. Well, we're gonna have to, uh, we're gonna have to,

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:55,129
I don't, it says I don't have any invites. You have social invites, friends, even, oh, there you are.

22
00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:01,449
Okay. So let me just join. Invite to now join your team. Right. Are you Snot? No, not Snot,

23
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:07,379
right? No, I am not Snot. It's not keeps trying to join. Maybe it's, maybe it's Charbord. Is it

24
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:15,139
Charbord? Charbord would unmute, right? I mean, and I see you. Yeah. No, no, no. I haven't joined.

25
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:19,460
Oh, there we go. Okay. Wait, somebody just randomly invite me or is that you? That was me. All

26
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:28,419
right. Okay. Who's Spush? That's, that's you, Charb? Yes, that's me. I'm Spush. Okay. All right.

27
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:36,020
There we go. How'd you get to level four? I'm level, am I level four? Yeah. Oh, no, that's

28
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,979
actually a visual bug. I think it's level one. Oh, it says you're all level 25 for me. What the

29
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,659
fuck? You want to see my character? We're all level four. Oh, I see. It's a visual bug. Yeah,

30
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:53,960
you're right. Yeah. So, um, we, is there anything we can do for a few minutes? Cause I don't know.

31
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,199
We might have to wait. We might have to wait. We can wait like 10 minutes if you want. Okay. Um,

32
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:06,620
so how much do you know about this game? Yeah. Maybe give it, give it, give it a quick. I mean,

33
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:14,379
I used to, believe it or not, I was a huge, huge, uh, Warhammer 40k RTS fan. Really? Oh, massive.

34
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,259
Um, I played as the Tao. Uh, I thought they were, I liked the, uh, what's the hero for the Tao?

35
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:29,500
It's, uh, XV. What's his name? I actually don't know. The guy with the flamethrower.

36
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,439
My chat's about to explode with the answer though. And then I also played, uh, what was the, the

37
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,839
chaos? Not the chaos. There was a different, like the K88. Yes. That's it. XV88. What was the other

38
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:50,250
one? There was another one in that expansion, the chaos elves or something. Oh, the, uh, Eldar.

39
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:58,759
Yeah. It was like the new expansion one. Yeah. The dark Eldar. Dark Eldar. Yep. Yep. That was

40
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:05,079
the other one. That's cool guys. Did you, did you play? Are you a huge, uh, Warhammer nerd?

41
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,839
Yeah. Oh yeah. What's your, what's your favorite army? It's definitely, I mean, knowing you, it's

42
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:21,639
um, the Blimpticus. Oh yeah. Blimpticus. Yeah. The boy, the Blimpticus. Oh, you made that up. Okay.

43
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,110
I was like, what the hell is the Blimpticus? He's flipping through his little handbook. Hold on.

44
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:36,620
I don't see that in, in, in my CTA. The Blimpticus. But yeah. So you get four classes,

45
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,910
right? I guess we can, let's go over it for real. Um, there's four classes and yeah, this is the,

46
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,720
what's, what's the, um, the, the Ogre or the, the Ogren, right? There's also, so this is like a

47
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,399
melee short range focus character, right? Yeah. He's like kind of the tank. You get shields later

48
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:59,240
on. You get like explosive weapons and a big old, like you have a dagger. That's the size of like

49
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,800
our entire body that you just swing around. So it's cool. You just kind of wait into the battle and

50
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,259
hold the line for everyone. Oh, I probably have some cosmetics, don't I? Let's see. Oh, I just

51
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:13,779
have a green t-shirt. Yeah. I don't have any cosmetics. I'm in my pajamas at level one.

52
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,339
So wait a minute. The thing dropped at, uh, in 15 minutes, right?

53
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,040
The thing? Uh, in exactly like probably, I think 15 minutes.

54
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,930
No, do we have to start exactly at that time? Yes. Okay. Then we, we need, we need to start a

55
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:36,089
mission. We need to be available at exactly 14 minutes. We're, we're all good. Mental. We're at

56
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:40,889
the, at the mission board. Uh, Trevor, what's your character's name? Um, my character's name or, uh,

57
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,889
my steam game? Uh, well, I, I believe I have you on steam unless you changed it. Turn your

58
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,370
eyes up. My character's name is snot. And before you make fun of it. We, it was him. We, we were

59
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,410
like, we were trying to kick you over and over again. Oh really? We don't know snot. No. We were

60
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,689
like, who's this snot guy? Oh, on the lower of my planet, that means it, I know it probably means

61
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:06,629
something else for you guys, but for me, it means something entirely different. Oh, please do tell.

62
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:14,550
Uh, it means runny boogers. Oh, no. Thanks for the info. That makes a lot of sense. Everybody

63
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,689
have a good sound quality now. I think I had to turn some of you guys up. I, I always, every,

64
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,209
every time I play a game on discord, I always have to go through and just individually do all the

65
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:28,839
bars. Yeah. Everyone. Oh, maybe I should do the advanced training just so people can see what it

66
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:36,019
looks like. Yeah. My training would take you like five minutes. It's, it's good to learn a lot.

67
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:40,579
I want to meet up with you guys. I want to see you. I'm at the big little, uh, I'm so excited.

68
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,420
The mission terminal. I'm at the meat grinder, just practicing, uh, my weaponing. Yeah. Where

69
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:54,019
is the, uh, the training area? Left. It's like a big old, there's like a lady in a tube in like a

70
00:07:54,019 --> 00:08:02,089
circular room. It's called the psych, psychinium. There's a lady in a tube. Okay. Yeah. No, that's a

71
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:09,990
barber. Wait. Okay. The guns are a little loud. Yeah. That's what guns do chat.

72
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,389
Is your hair. Don't tell Brian, don't tell German where the meat grinder is.

73
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,389
Well, that's where the training is. Your personality trim.

74
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:31,800
Should I use, should I get the bugle berry? Whatever. Is there a map? No. Um, I haven't found

75
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,549
one. You just kind of learn. Oh wait, I found the barber. Yeah. You can get it. It's pretty damn

76
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:44,039
good in this. I have to say I was playing last night and I was like, Oh, like, Ooh, that music.

77
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,679
Yeah. Kind of surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Yeah. I, uh, so I've been playing this game

78
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:55,000
a lot over the last week or so that it's been available. And like two nights ago, I was in bed

79
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,159
just listening to Spotify and chilling out, like getting ready to sleep. And so the, the

80
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,360
soundtrack for this game is on Spotify and it auto really started playing the soundtrack from this

81
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,759
game. After I'd just gotten done playing this game and my eyes literally went wide up like,

82
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,320
like a Wokage emote. I was like, and I like got up out of bed and went back to my computer and

83
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,519
played for two hours because I was like, so moved by the, it felt like it made, it was like,

84
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,000
I got to play this now. Yeah. It was, it just, you know, the emperor called me and I had to,

85
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,720
yeah, to respond to the call. Yeah. At that point you had to, I'm very excited. I've, I've

86
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,039
in the prologue and there was some, there was some music that was just,

87
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,470
it seemed like I was swinging to the beat and it seemed like it was cool. Right.

88
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,820
So I'm very excited and I'm very excited as to potentially happening here. And

89
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:47,259
were you a big left for dead guy at all? I was, I, I actually, I loved it left for dead, but

90
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:51,340
you'll love this. Yeah. I mean, I, I played Vermintide. Vermintide was a lot of fun.

91
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,860
Yeah. See, I had never played Vermintide. So this was my first experience of this

92
00:09:55,419 --> 00:10:01,019
series aside from Dawn of War. That's the only other 40 K I've ever played. Yeah. So,

93
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,139
so when I played this last night, I was like, oh, this is, this is good.

94
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,139
Dawn of War was, I was obsessed with it. Yeah. That was awesome.

95
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:18,230
Yeah. So Vermintide in this game, both have like really, I think, well-tuned both gun and

96
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,450
like melee combat. So just the pacing of like fighting through hordes and pushing things back

97
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,409
and then dodging out of the way of like stuff. It's all very readable. Is there any, anything,

98
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:32,570
where's the least amount of info in the screen? Top right, top left, bottom right was like the,

99
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,379
where's there like no info? Are you looking for a cam spot? Yeah. I need a cam spot here. You

100
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:42,649
should do a direct middle. Yeah. They always want the middle for me too. I think top right has been

101
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,370
the least amount that I've seen. Okay. Yeah. Or top left is just like the watermark. The beta

102
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:57,220
test. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm ready. So you played the tabletop, Jerma, back in your... No,

103
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,139
I played on like the RTS, the Warhammer 40 K. Oh, the RTS one. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I,

104
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:06,620
I started playing through Vermintide. That's my first exposure to the Warhammer universe. And then

105
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,860
I played the Total War Warhammer franchise, which I fell in love with. I love the voice work. So this

106
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,629
is like my first big 40 K one. The voice acting is always like 10 out of 10 in these games.

107
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:21,720
I love it too. Oh, are we doing voices? Please. Can we do voices? I love role play. Just guys,

108
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:29,769
lads. Okay. I'll be my guy that I picked. What does that sound like? My character sounds exactly

109
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:40,500
like me. It's really weird. It is kind of weird. Yeah. I thought like this kind of like salt spire

110
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,220
from Vermintide. I was going to say, yep. Yep. That's it. That's the classic. The Pernicus,

111
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:54,059
the Zealot. Vinny, why are you on the news again? Because I saw that game. I saw that. I

112
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:58,840
saw you on the news again, Vinny. What are you doing? What happened? You want to explain?

113
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:06,419
Yeah, I'll explain. Uh, the reporter interviewed me for Trombone Champ. And then I explained it

114
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:12,389
while I was playing Placid Plastic Duck Simulator. It's just a plastic duck game. And I said, I dare

115
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:17,750
an interview viewer to interview me about this. I was like, come on news. We can, we can do something

116
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,169
like this, um, about this game where you just watch ducks fall into a pool. And then the interviewer

117
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:30,070
from the previous segment emailed me and said, challenge accepted. And then he interviewed me

118
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:36,090
with my alien on the couch next to me about this plastic duck game. And that's literally all I was

119
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:42,009
on the news for. You know what's kind of nonsense? Yeah. You as it goes, as it's going right now,

120
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:46,409
you are potentially going to potentially be interviewed on the news more than like

121
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:52,250
Ninja. You know what I mean? If it keeps going this way. Yeah. Just keeps, just keep telling people

122
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,830
to do it and they'll keep doing it. All right. I challenge, I challenge anyone to interview me

123
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,509
about this right now, this moment, just me talking to my friends here in this call.

124
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:06,309
It's starting to realize he was going to be the next face of gaming.

125
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:11,830
Yeah. You're, you're, you're going to turn into like the, the, the face of, okay, who's the gamer?

126
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,830
All right. There he is. Let's interview him. There he is. He played that duck falling game.

127
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,210
I played the duck falling game and other meme streamer bait games. Um, and then I'm going to

128
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,610
start getting people to floss on New Year's Eve. It's going to be great. Yeah. But you'll actually

129
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,210
be able to do it. I mean, you live in New York, right? So, you know, the, the, the energy,

130
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,129
I know the people first to have to go, Hey, I'm walking. They know you. Yeah. They're like, Hey,

131
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:38,549
this is what's up, boy. Hey, I'll fly for you. New York. I just came from Katz's deli. How you

132
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:44,440
doing? Let's do a little dance. Is that, is, is the hub world? Hold on being too weird. Is the

133
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,919
procedural? Oh, no, no. Is the hub world have just other players just kind of hanging out? That's

134
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,799
what I meant. And I said procedural. Yes, it does. Random. Oh, just the wrong word.

135
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:59,480
Procedurally generated hub world. It sounded good at the moment, but it was completely wrong.

136
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,879
Sorry. Think of how absolutely fucking annoying that would be. Yeah. Procedurally generated hub

137
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,639
world. And it's always someplace new. Hey, I can't find you. It's because hub worlds are different,

138
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,850
dude. Yeah. Like, Oh yeah. I can't move past it. Blacksmith is like on a whole nother level. You

139
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,179
have to go in an elevator and go up this time. That'd be such, that would be so annoying. Okay.

140
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:27,179
Let's see. We have like five minutes, right? We've got, we've gotten just about five minutes

141
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:33,259
and that you guys know about to be excited about this. The lore of like this game or like hive

142
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:38,860
worlds in general. No, tell me. I could tell you. I'm actually quite the, uh, go on. It's not then

143
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:48,460
let's hear it. Let's hear it. Yeah. In the year 300, there was, there was the main character named

144
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:58,330
snot. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, sweating pressures on now. I don't even know. I can't even begin to fake my

145
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,529
way through it guys. I don't know a single thing about Warhammer. Yeah. That's the word really

146
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:07,370
raised his hand in class and well, there were night elves, there were orcs and they were undead.

147
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:15,879
That's always the worst. They fought in storm wind. Wait, is the year 40,000 Warhammer 40,000. It

148
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,080
means we are, what is the 40,000 is the, the amount of time Pat, somebody know this?

149
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,740
No, I think it's 40,000 years later, right? It was like desperately reading his chat for

150
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,539
someone to save him with this. No, no, no, no, no. I, I used to play a shitload of Warhammer 40k.

151
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:42,169
Okay. Please let me, let me do this. The Warhammer 40k takes place in the timeline of Warhammer,

152
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:55,450
right? Okay. It's the four milky way galaxy from human prehistory up through the 41st millennium

153
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,009
in the Warhammer 40,000 setting throughout. Yeah. Preparative references to present dates

154
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:07,779
will be made with respect to the original Imperial calendar used before the birth of the great rift.

155
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:11,620
That sounds like you're reading off of Wikipedia. I think he just accessed the

156
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,509
deep annals of his brain, dude. That was like, I just had to pull it up. Yeah. I said, I like the

157
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:24,490
kind of, um, one of my favorite, uh, I love the orcs. They were awesome. Yeah. The orcs are great.

158
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:30,950
They are pretty cool. What are they? What was the, uh, the, the main orc? What was his name?

159
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:44,809
Gork. His name is Gork. No, no, no, no. His name, Grim Skull, Grim Skull. Yep. He had the chainsaw

160
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:52,970
and like this. See, I know. Yeah. I know the song. When I did the orc massage video game,

161
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:59,769
I included the song. I went orcs, orcs, orcs, orcs. Oh yeah. That's the song. Oh, that's right. You

162
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,890
do really get around with the games you play between plastic duck game and everything in

163
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:11,190
between from orc massage to 40 K. It's a duck game. Yeah. I have, you know, I think here's everything.

164
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:17,799
I am actually like very excited to play this. I'm so happy. I am like, this is my first level

165
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,640
I'm ever going to queue up for. Okay. This is going to be fun. It's going to be fun. Do I have

166
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,990
to meet you guys somewhere? Uh, I think we just get pulled in, right? I think. Yeah. Once the,

167
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,549
once I queue up. Yeah. We just, we had literally three minutes. Are you guys ready? Three minutes.

168
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:38,630
I'm excited. I don't know what is going to happen. And I actually kind of, I actually kind of don't

169
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:47,269
know either. I know that something is a, something is about to happen. Now, is this something

170
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:52,630
appropriate for level one players? I don't know. We will find out. Oh, that's a good question.

171
00:17:52,789 --> 00:18:00,069
I'm sure we can handle it. Well, I don't, I don't think they would have, I don't think,

172
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:07,319
I think the part would have made that clear. I have this little prison jumpsuit. I think I can

173
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,880
handle anything. Yeah. So they've been dropping new maps every few days because of a, it's like

174
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,720
rolling out into, you know, the full launch. Yep. So we'll see what happens in two minutes.

175
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:24,329
Well, chat, this is the mission board. It's not quite like left for dead in the sense that you

176
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:28,250
just kind of go through a campaign. You just choose missions. They're like bounties. They're

177
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,809
timed and then you get money and experience. It's pretty neat. It's actually a very addictive loop.

178
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:39,930
Yeah. And they have different modifiers that can randomly get rolled on them. So for example,

179
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:45,210
like endless hoard. Another one I saw in the other beta was like lights out where all the

180
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,650
lights in the map are out and you basically need to bring flashlights to find your way everywhere.

181
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:56,470
It's like a horror version. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Here we go. You said that. Here it comes.

182
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:02,869
We have 60 seconds remaining. Oh, oh shit. Okay. Uh, I'm on the edge of my seat.

183
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:08,230
Is there drops enabled? I want drops. How do I get drops? New war zone conditions in 47 seconds.

184
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:15,559
Alert global condition alert. New war zone conditions in 40 seconds. I just repeated what

185
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:19,319
you just said. Yeah. There's going to be a meteor that hits tomato town.

186
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,819
It got wiped out. All right. So give me a quick little tutorial here. What's the, all right.

187
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,220
I know F is charge. I know that I can do an uppercut tutorial with 20 seconds left. Yeah.

188
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,900
Yeah. Look, it's time for everyone to get, by the way, I'm having a little bit of trouble looking

189
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:41,619
in the chat here. I don't see anybody spamming. Let's go. I mean, what the heck's going on here?

190
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:45,420
Maybe I'm being, I just, my glasses a little bit here. I don't really see it. I did that

191
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,390
tutorial. And the second they gave me like a fourth ability I can do, I just started

192
00:19:50,390 --> 00:20:00,309
just kind of pushing buttons randomly. I got a little overwhelmed. Oh, it's happening. Should

193
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,549
I be seeing something? It's still pretty, all the missions went away. Yeah. The missions are

194
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:15,930
gone and it's just quick play. Why do we quick play? Uh, I don't know. I don't know what happened.

195
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,970
Is that Disney castle? Yeah, that's the magic kingdom, dude. So do we just do a quick play?

196
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:30,250
The missions are rebooting. I think maybe we'll give it a second because it's a very specific

197
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:40,490
mission name. Okay. I put it in the chat. So we have 239 hours we have to wait. That's enough

198
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,849
time to talk about the lore of the game, I think. Maybe not. Actually not. Yeah. There's so much

199
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:53,910
lore in this stupid game. Let's see. I'm a huge lore nerd though. So I will talk as long as you let

200
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:59,990
me. Are you actually like a big Warhammer like Ben? You are, right? Yeah. I only found it. Oh,

201
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:06,869
it just popped back up. Oh, power supply interruption. That's the one. Okay. There's

202
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:17,450
it go. It's going to go at level two. Hold on one sec. Oh, no. Okay. Magistrate Obelette. All right.

203
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:26,309
Let's go. Oh, it is lights out. Holy shit. Lights out. Wait, is it? Wait, is it the power supply

204
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:31,109
place? Yeah. Power supply interruption. Wait, I'm freaked out. Oh, it's going to be freaky.

205
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:37,700
We need to bring a flashlight. I just have this terrible little sword that I found in the trash.

206
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,460
I don't have anything. I don't have a flashlight. You'll have something, Snot, if you just.

207
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm like babysitting these pajama kids. I'm ready. This Lays gun has a flashlight,

208
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:55,240
so I'll bring this. All right. Let's see if I got a flashlight. Oh, that'll be good.

209
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:01,819
Wait, do we need flashlights? It's going to be dark, man. Power supply interruption. Press I,

210
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:07,769
and then click on your weapon, and you'll see an icon that looks like a flashlight.

211
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:14,779
It's three icons on your weapon, and the right one should be a flashlight. Mine's a knife. Well. Oh,

212
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:20,059
no. Well, shit. Augren's are traditionally stupid. I don't know if you could know how to function

213
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:27,319
a flashlight. Very good. What is your weapon? I have the default stuff. Just a cudgel of some kind.

214
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,359
It's like, but it's like a makeshift club, it looks like. Did we naturally all pick

215
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:37,079
a different class out of the four? That's cool. That's actually pretty remarkable.

216
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:42,019
That's the first time I've seen that. All right. Here it is. This is the big moment.

217
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:52,099
Oh, my Lord. You're massive. Look, he's counting his fingers. He's not like his iPhone.

218
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,779
It's the Ork massage guy. Stop bringing up Ork massage so that I don't have to say it in the call

219
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:08,140
anymore. That's going to be your next interview. One hundred percent. This is us. This is us. This

220
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:14,279
is OK. Calm down. How cool are we? Yeah, we look great. Thought I just crashed the game. All right.

221
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:20,089
Here we go. It's time to play. This is definitely darker than it usually is. Smoosh, Copernicus,

222
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:28,490
and Vine. Dark time. Four of us. Are there Fortnite emotes? Before we begin, guys. Not entirely.

223
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:35,529
Sorry, I don't have somebody to be flashlight lead. I got. Can you see my flashlight? I can.

224
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:49,750
Yes. OK. Oh, I love the acting. That's a Tom T. I don't know. It's like a numpty.

225
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:55,190
What's the flashlight button in case they get separated? Mouse five on your.

226
00:23:55,269 --> 00:24:03,059
We already are separated. Oh, Chris. Oops. Oh, what happened?

227
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:08,900
There's some zombie friends down here infected. Oh, it's fucking dark. This is really dark.

228
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,779
Are these guys confirmed bad or are we just killing like. Oh, they're heretics.

229
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:20,940
They're they're heretics. And aren't they infected with like worms? Yeah, they're infected with.

230
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,869
I can't see anything. If you look closely, they got like postules all over them, postules,

231
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:31,109
whatever. Yeah. And when you hit them with a shovel, maggots fall out of their face.

232
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:34,950
Really? That's gross. That's why you brought the shovel. I knew there was some meta reason.

233
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,710
What's this thing? That's the only one I have. The only melee I have, but sure.

234
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:47,829
All right. You want to see some cool shit? Let's go. Oh, I like. He's got a flamethrower. What? Yeah.

235
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,349
Yeah. I came to purge some freaking heretics.

236
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,549
Feels pretty good. It is so dark. This is usually well lit.

237
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,799
I haven't done a sewer level at all. Have you? Yeah, you have. So.

238
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:16,980
Did I kill it? Oh, it's not. Help me. I think a dog pushed me. That wasn't intentional.

239
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:25,509
I think it's been the only one that brought a flashlight. I think so. Oh, my God. Oh,

240
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:28,710
you can see them glowing in the dark over there. That's so cool. Look at that. Oh,

241
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:40,950
that's terrifying. Throw a grenade. Grenade out. Let's go. I'm chopping them up. I'm chopping them

242
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:50,299
up. Ow. Oh, my God. I keep shooting you guys. I'm sorry. Is there friendly fire, right? I don't

243
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:55,099
think so. There actually isn't friendly fire. They could just get upset. Like the characters

244
00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:01,019
are like, oh, watch what you're doing, mate. So good. I'm too much of an impact to sound like.

245
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:05,740
Hey, why are you targeting me? Ammo if anyone needs it. I don't mix in some like

246
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:12,619
Warhammer space terminology. Would you hit me with the blast the end of the of this of this laser

247
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:19,740
laser gun? Oh, my God. I threw a box in that guy's head. What's the curse word that replaces

248
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:25,819
fucking this groggin? What is it? That does not have the same punch to it.

249
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:33,019
So one of my chat just said dirty sci fi is so cool. It is literally a great way to describe it.

250
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:39,460
Yeah. Oh, my God. I just I have a brick as a grenade. It doesn't explode.

251
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,140
So the Ogryn just throw off the whole box of grenades. They can't figure out.

252
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:50,579
That's so funny. Individual ones. I think there's a sniper over there.

253
00:26:50,660 --> 00:27:00,839
It's my mouth. I tried, but I've got this mush. Do we got to find some more flashlights? I can't

254
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:07,769
see it. Oh, no, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. Help. Also, they're suppressing us right now.

255
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,259
You have to like get out of the way of suppressing fire. Otherwise, your aim

256
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:22,579
gets all screwed up. Are we going to hear that ticking sound? That's an explosive guy, like a

257
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:26,900
boomer. Oh, but do you need grenades? He's just going to run out. Actually, yeah, I do. I threw

258
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:35,130
a grab those. It is a lot scarier when you can't see them. Just listen. There is that light.

259
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:54,819
OK, got him near us. I got you. You look like a monster on the ground. Just try to keep my

260
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:59,380
flashlight active, which means melee is not a good option because then it gets. What does that sound?

261
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:06,420
It sounds like a sword. Why are there so many people down here? What are they doing? Oh, my

262
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,940
goodness. It was a rave. It was a Matrix Revolutions rave. That seems like the best time of your life

263
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:20,359
coming down here. It's been a weekend getting sweaty. Oh, music, guys. Music just started.

264
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,309
I'm going to die. I can't see, guys. I think I'm falling. What the hell happened to you, Snot?

265
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,430
I think these guys pushed me. They picked me up and gave me a wedgie.

266
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,789
Fucking walked off. What did I do? Oh, my God. Wait, where did Smoosh go?

267
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,880
Smoosh is dead. It's dark. We are in trouble. Everyone just walk off the ledges.

268
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,839
I seriously think I did walk just straight off. It's dark. We can get you back. We just need to

269
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:58,680
find you. OK. He's the only one with a flashlight. His entire job is to just keep it trained on the

270
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,400
way forward. Yeah, this is actually pretty cool, though. So this is going to do more arson. Does

271
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,200
this level exist in the game? Like just the game right now? But this is like a wow. Now you can't

272
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,960
see pretty much. Yeah. All right. I think I think they just wanted us to be like scared. They were

273
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,680
like, yeah, we're going to make sure I'm scared. Yeah. Have a dark environment for him. I

274
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:30,490
accidentally ran off the cliff. Yeah, we'll get you back. It's OK. Oh, my God. What the fuck is

275
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:34,970
this? What is it? What is it? What is it? I have never seen this before. I've never seen this.

276
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:41,450
What is that? We're so screwed. We are so screwed. I don't have a hemo. That was actually terrifying.

277
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,480
Smoosh, are you OK? You're not OK. I'm just observing. Holy fuck. OK. Help someone. He's

278
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:57,240
killing me so bad. I don't even know who to attack. Sorry. He's just annihilating you.

279
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:05,079
Help me. Help. Just fucking sweat. Oh, he's so close. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. You got

280
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:10,069
him? He's dead. But we're going to get snot up. Oh, my God. Just leave me. There's another special.

281
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:16,150
There's another special infected. What the hell is happening? That was insane. That was a real

282
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,460
fucking demon. We just all got downed. That was terrifying. Wow. All right. That was cool.

283
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:27,579
Do we need to go back to the lobby and buy some things? I've got I've got a couple ideas for

284
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:33,900
supplies. Yeah, I'm going to bring a flashlight. We need flashlights. Yeah, for real. I don't I

285
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:40,150
don't think you can actually afford flashlights at the moment. Damn. You just really said that.

286
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:46,549
I said that. There's a leveling system, too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's how you unlock more weapon

287
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:53,109
classes and, you know, stuff in the hub. Full four player co-op, by the way. That's the view,

288
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:56,549
obviously. You can play it alone if you want to as well. You don't have to be with four people.

289
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:05,859
That was very intense. The music kicked in, too. And that got my I got my blood pumping.

290
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:11,220
I I've been playing this game for like 30 hours now over the last week. And I did not I've never

291
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,660
seen that entity. That was the first they just added them. I think right now. Maybe that's what

292
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,660
they wanted us to wait for. Yeah, I think that's what they wanted to close my eyes. I'm not going

293
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:26,200
to lie. I believe that it was just like too scary lapsed on this floor with like this hallowed

294
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,680
frosty ground around it. And then I walked up to it and it just animated and went after my freaking

295
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,599
neck. It was terrifying. That thing was doing like 10 attacks a second, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. I

296
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:42,839
no idea how to deal with that. And then show me where you buy flashlights so that maybe one day

297
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,880
when I find a pretty little thing, I think you need to be level two. Unbelievable. All right.

298
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:55,369
It's all right. We'll manage. We'll manage. We should do a level one mission now and then maybe

299
00:31:55,369 --> 00:32:01,289
come back to that one since it's there. Yeah. Let's let's we're going to the goal of this whole

300
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:04,490
thing is to beat that mission. Well, let's start with like an easy one, right? Like somebody to

301
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:10,410
get us. Yeah, we got this consignment yard HL 1736 mission, which we could probably do that way.

302
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:15,880
You guys can level up and buy another weapon. Yeah, that was crazy, though. All right.

303
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:22,759
I was with this one. This is also a new map that just came out today. I think the relay station

304
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:28,150
TRS 150. I do that. What difficulty level is this one? Yeah, we could do that one. That's cool.

305
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:35,299
You can crack in. Someone said you can upgrade your health or like vigor. Can you do that? Yeah.

306
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:41,859
So if you press I and then go to feats every five levels, you unlock basically a new perk

307
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:47,220
for your class. And that's how you kind of build a you can build like a build for your

308
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:53,480
your how your play style is. We got you. And that includes like, you know, more tanky damage.

309
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:59,750
OK, I see. Yeah, I didn't see that before. But no, I can't do it anyway right now. But yeah,

310
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:06,700
drops. There are drops enabled. You guys have drops on yours, too. Yeah. How do you do that?

311
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:14,059
You've got to connect your which to the Warhammer thing in game or out game. It's on the on Twitch's

312
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:21,079
like dashboard. I'll do it another time. Can I get some of your drops? Yeah. Open one of our

313
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:24,359
streams and leave it on. Actually, I'll do that. I'll do that for myself. That's a good idea.

314
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:30,859
Wait, you just leave the stream on? Yes. Leave it on the background.

315
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:37,500
Get free items. But I have to connect, though. No, you can connect later. It tracks your watch

316
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,900
time first. All right. Looks like I'm watching Jerma while we're doing this. All right. Hey,

317
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,019
welcome. Hey, Jerma, I'm watching you right now. What's up, buddy?

318
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:59,509
All right, we can see. Chad, I'll enable drops if I ever play this again on stream,

319
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:11,699
and I probably will. But next time, this is much less scary. I think I just tried to shoot this

320
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:20,820
innocent guy coming. What a hero guy. I like that the door. Look at the look at the door handle.

321
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,860
It's just a skull. Yeah, I need to get one of these from my house. So it's not just the skull.

322
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,059
Apparently, the four key universals are called servitors, and they're actually

323
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:37,699
somewhat conscious humans. Really? Brains still intact that, you know, they're basically programmed

324
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:43,940
their brains to function for their purpose, like opening the door to be a servitor. That would be

325
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:50,500
just a pleasant existence. You wouldn't have a whole lot to worry about. I know. Yeah, you can

326
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,300
find them like there's like one for like drying your hands in the bathroom. There's like a hand

327
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:01,019
drying servitor. Are we all here? Your AI in this universe? Yeah. Well, so it's like doing a little

328
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:09,460
bit. Yeah, there's a lot of really weird, dark, like grim dark shit in the 40k universe. I know

329
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:20,099
there's a god emperor, which is also very dune. Game looks really nice. Yeah. Oh, Dave in my chat.

330
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:24,980
I don't know why I said that. Dave, what option do I turn off for better performance if I need to

331
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:34,889
ray tracing? You want to turn that off? That's just wondering. Just wanted to make sure they

332
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:43,579
were dead. I'm just checking the work there. Smush. Oh, Adam, you have a flame thrower.

333
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:51,719
I got a freaking flame thrower. That's pretty sick. The guy here. Every class gets a couple

334
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:58,500
weapons that are unique to them. I have a slap. Are you kidding me? Big meaty slap. What? Wait,

335
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,659
what's mine? Do you know what mine are? Should be if you have a button on your mouse.

336
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:09,980
Oh, yeah, I've got a force push. I'm basically basically like in Star Wars.

337
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:17,659
So this happens a lot where the ogren of the team gets shot a lot. Yep.

338
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,900
Because doing my job in the melee and then I end up shooting them a ton.

339
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:37,989
He's so big. He's like a door. He's like a door. I am like a big door. You say there's not friendly

340
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:45,989
fire. They just get mad at you. It doesn't feel like you wait. Watch out. Be careful.

341
00:36:50,840 --> 00:37:01,289
You shot me in the back. I keep shooting German. Oh, my God. I knew me green fire.

342
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:07,610
Oh, look at this. It's wildfire. The world looks so cool. This is beautiful. Guys,

343
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:11,690
we need to unbolt this thing and take it home. This thing's probably worth a lot.

344
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:16,329
Probably 40. Who's crying? The zealots, man.

345
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:24,389
Heretics. They picked the wrong God and they're just salty about it. Yeah.

346
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:31,190
It's nice to know that things in the future are still very. Oh, we're going outside.

347
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,679
Wait, this is the first time we've gone outside in this game.

348
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,860
Reloading. Oh, my God. I haven't yet. I haven't seen this either.

349
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:49,159
Hang on. Let me just grab some. Got him. Look at that beautiful, beautiful skyline. Breathe in

350
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:56,039
that fresh air. More discipline would not go amiss. Is it not the measure by which warriors are

351
00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:06,420
judged? I just have been following you around and hitting the thing that you hit again after it's

352
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:14,099
dead. OK, you know, you can. What happened? Oh, dude, the lights are on. What is your

353
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:24,230
Falcon? Pick me up and a fucking Falcon. Yeah, I look like I tried to peek over.

354
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,670
I tried to peek over the edge and look down there, but it did not work.

355
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,079
I keep forgetting there's a dodge. The dodge is so much fun.

356
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:42,280
It's just what's the dodge again? In a direction. Oh, yeah. Was the space.

357
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,420
There are difficulties on the levels, too. Oh, yeah. That's awesome. So this is a level one.

358
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:56,619
One way we tried first was to it goes all the way up to five. So by the time you get this

359
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:04,099
five ones, you got to be like, no, the highest level of that chart before.

360
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:08,150
And they're they're pretty damn difficult,

361
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,780
but really satisfying. Just makes you like work as a team really carefully.

362
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,940
But you also get better weapons as you go. Mm hmm. You have tried to five?

363
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:25,369
Well, no way. Oh, you haven't. OK, a lock. Everybody in here? OK, good. Yeah.

364
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:33,059
I want to get some new weapons. So this is also a medical station, which we don't need right now

365
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:37,780
because we're only on an easy difficulty, but you can heal on these. And every time you go down,

366
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,219
you get this like purple bar on your health and that just reduces your max health.

367
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:44,739
And whenever you feel these, it gets very, very. Yeah. Oh, ammo and stuff.

368
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:49,539
And this guy's still alive. This is a server. This guy's still alive. Yeah.

369
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:58,280
Look, he looks so uncomfortable. Oh, that's right. I forgot about that.

370
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,219
Just ask us to take him with us because he's fucking lonely and does nothing better to do.

371
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:07,500
That's sad. What's happening over here? We get to run for you guys.

372
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:11,340
Oh, my God. That was Jerma. I thought Jerma had picked you up.

373
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,139
It was smacking you, dude. Yeah, I was outside looking looking at the cool stuff.

374
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:20,460
And then I see fucking a giant ochre. Yeah, they're all just staring at

375
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,659
the medical station while it's getting. Damn, look at this.

376
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:26,699
I'm getting overwhelmed like sensory overload. It looks like Mad Max.

377
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,340
Do you love it? When are we going to when are we going to get the go get us?

378
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:32,380
Well, I don't know what that is when I'm wait.

379
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:36,539
Is that like those the blimpkins or whatever I called them before them?

380
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:39,900
Oh, yeah. Then the good because you'll know.

381
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:45,539
This guy's played 40K. You can tell. Oh, we've got a whole.

382
00:40:45,539 --> 00:41:02,219
By the way, go get a time, I think. Oh, my God. That dog scared the shit out of me.

383
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:06,019
Help me. It's not what we're going to do with you.

384
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:21,619
I need to stay in the background. Jess, I think we're good.

385
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:27,269
I'll get out of here. Heretic gather thermoelectric cells.

386
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:29,510
OK, we have to find thermoelectric cells. All right.

387
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:36,980
It should be near the good guys. I don't know what that is.

388
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,500
Still hold on. You'll know in just about five seconds.

389
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,480
Two, three, four, five, six, maybe. Hold on.

390
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:55,500
Maybe another five seconds or so. What are you looking for?

391
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,780
There's no payoff for this. There's no out for this bit.

392
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,260
There is, but I don't know if it's going to happen.

393
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:07,829
I got one of the power supplies. You did?

394
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:14,139
Yeah. Nice. Where did you find it? It was up top over here.

395
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,900
No, I'll just look over here and hope for the best.

396
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,780
Oh, that one was on my map. Oh, over here. I got another one.

397
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,219
Oh, you know, you got it. Wow.

398
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:41,849
Let's wait. I see one.

399
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:52,539
I see one neighbor. Don't let him up.

400
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:06,119
You guys get the other one. It's here.

401
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:07,639
It's here. You guys are beating my ass.

402
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,960
I'm coming, snot. Oh, I'm coming.

403
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,000
Did we ever resolve that go good a bit?

404
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,199
Not yet. Maybe. Oh, we got a lot.

405
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:19,000
There's a lot. There's a lot. Go long, dog.

406
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,400
My grandfather used to call zucchini go boots.

407
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:26,440
It's not a zucchini. No, I know.

408
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,880
But yeah, now the thing that we're that I'm waiting for is not a zucchini,

409
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,539
but that's you door. That's a zucchini.

410
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:36,340
Is that what you said?

411
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,380
Dog help dog.

412
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:52,570
It's like door dashing one single Gatorade. It's like, come on, man.

413
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,670
You drink the whole thing.

414
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,389
I do open the door and grab it and small thing in front of them.

415
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:03,110
There's no size chuggy cheese pizza once for my birthday.

416
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,269
Last ones over here. That's nice.

417
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,510
Yeah, I got to customize what was on it and they put every topping and it cost $80.

418
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,309
What? Wait, what?

419
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:14,789
That's clown pizza at that point.

420
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:17,030
Yeah, it was a little they put little diamonds on it.

421
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:19,429
All right, we got sardines and they put

422
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:25,219
the rest of the toppings.

423
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:26,980
We go through this even eat sardines.

424
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,019
Yeah, let me go through it now.

425
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,500
Oh, behind us. What?

426
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:35,210
Throwing a grenade.

427
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,849
Started back up. Grind them up.

428
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:41,139
Yeah, seriously. Oh, that wasn't so bad.

429
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:48,659
Don't forget that you can tag special enemies to make it easier for everyone to see.

430
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:54,260
Oh, good job, Charlie implemented it.

431
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,500
I love that overhead.

432
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,619
I mean, it's not sorry.

433
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:00,820
It's not please.

434
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,820
We use our names here.

435
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,320
All right.

436
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,079
It's the same for the untested soul.

437
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:10,570
So you say we're playing on easy right now?

438
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:11,690
Yeah, this is the easiest.

439
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,570
Wow. All right.

440
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,800
This is this has got some.

441
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,639
I think difficulty is actually dependent on each person.

442
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,840
I think I set mine a little higher, which is why I'm dying so much.

443
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,039
So I see that explains it.

444
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,300
Who has the flame thrower?

445
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:28,780
That's awesome.

446
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,739
That's me. The results bastard here.

447
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,579
Another. Whoa.

448
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:37,690
OK. I mean, you know, there are all baskets.

449
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:46,880
No, not quite.

450
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:57,239
Oh, my goodness.

451
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:00,039
Milly range is much longer than you think, says a chat member.

452
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:03,920
OK. Oh, yeah.

453
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,679
Dodging and blocking is your friend.

454
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,719
Yeah, it is.

455
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:09,280
You can also hold right click and then left click to push.

456
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,800
Oh, yeah. And then you get a special attack after that, too.

457
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,559
Yeah. They told me all this.

458
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:16,559
I just can't remember it all.

459
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:18,000
Yes. I mean, it's a heck of a game.

460
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:20,320
To write this down on the like, the palm of my hand.

461
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,519
So I can do you guys see this?

462
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:26,960
What is it the like one of them is just stretchy.

463
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,159
It looks like Pokemon pilot.

464
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,800
Well, we just killed like 50 of them.

465
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,400
Yeah, but one of them got real stretchy.

466
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,519
That's all right.

467
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:37,239
It's fine.

468
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:37,800
It's the chaos.

469
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,400
Chaos. Yeah.

470
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:40,679
We'll crouch.

471
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:45,199
Oh, I'm here to stay together.

472
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,800
Low hanging Pokemon joke.

473
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,760
I don't think it does anything.

474
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,550
There's a lot of view.

475
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:57,800
Distance can we click this? I don't think this is a button. I could have just declared. I have found a switch

476
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:03,039
All right, enter

477
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,880
Plastil is what's plastic is that just money to buy some flamer and they have the best sound effect in the game in my

478
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,380
Opinion it's the sound of like a fucking gas stove turning on like the

479
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,079
Right before they fire. Oh, that's a cool

480
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:23,929
Do we have to bring sound design in this are incredible is incredible?

481
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:31,480
Maybe class steel is current in this level for so I wonder if there's a I guess we have to do if you kill

482
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,719
Anything or maybe it's bugged

483
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,380
It says enters station. It's probably just one of these side paths

484
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:40,909
Maybe up. Oh

485
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:46,230
Also, I called I called the psycher a freak a freeze. Yeah, I heard that. Yeah, so that was

486
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:53,269
It's not just very nice to be working on a team where people just are shitty with each other. Oh, here we go

487
00:47:53,269 --> 00:47:54,829
Yeah

488
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:57,079
Yeah

489
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:02,010
I'll take care of that

490
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,869
Yeah, it's interesting because I was playing this yesterday. I was like, oh man, there's no map button

491
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:14,750
I've gotten so used to having map buttons that I'm always opening and yet I had almost no problem navigating the levels

492
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,750
I feel like they're they're pretty

493
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:20,989
They seem vast, but you know where to go

494
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:24,829
They also have a little

495
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:31,670
Like weenies here like this freakin little arrow that goes aiming at you and then he pulled a sword out instead

496
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:34,429
See where to go

497
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:40,349
So snot and me could use this

498
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:47,710
One spot left. Yes, the purple is that your max health reduced because they've been at times you've gone down

499
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:51,909
It'll fix it so this fixes

500
00:48:54,829 --> 00:49:02,469
You didn't think the the medical station man, which is a little rude he hasn't taught he hasn't spoken to somebody in like six years

501
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:06,469
Behind you Johnny cab

502
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:20,349
God there's a lot of detail. Yeah, I was gonna say this is

503
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:30,960
But immense if I say immensely detailed I like all the clutter it really just feels so

504
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,800
claustrophobic and this is the level that's outside like every level you're like

505
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,940
constantly indoors

506
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,219
Kind of want to see maybe this is not a good idea

507
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:45,980
I kind of want to see what this looks like with ray tracing on high for a second. I go in here

508
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:55,309
I love the slap. Hello the sound of it's so good to write

509
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:06,059
Can you guys hear me yeah ray tracing on my game crashed? Oh, no. Yeah, see that ray tracing man. I've tried to warn me

510
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,460
You can reconnect yeah

511
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
That's good, thankfully

512
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,800
Guy

513
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Someone said what the fuck did he expect?

514
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,320
expected ray tracing to turn on

515
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,480
Dude if you turn one of the known bugs, I think is ray tracing

516
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,400
if you turn ray tracing on in general like in the middle of any game you get your computer just kind of goes like

517
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,440
Should I should have known it's not like it's the first time in the first game. But yeah

518
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:42,000
Aren't they doing a bunch of stability patches too. Yeah

519
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:51,679
Yeah, this is this is still the beta by the way, so it's what the 30th is when the game actually launches, right?

520
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,639
If you pre-order it you get access to the beta and comes out on the 30th

521
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,039
Wait, get away from the barrel. I accidentally hit that. Oh

522
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:07,880
Well, this is a bot oh wait, this is who Vinny was okay

523
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,559
This guy with the hair, this is me. I'm the pernick. I know I turned on

524
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,960
I saw like a funny haircut and I was like I have to hit this person

525
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:28,119
You look like count Olaf

526
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,000
Okay

527
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Who's count Olaf?

528
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:41,030
Count Olaf from a bad time bad luck

529
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,750
Lemony Snicket presents bad luck bad time

530
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:53,889
Jiminy cricket. Hey, I'm back everyone. Hey, welcome back

531
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,130
You didn't miss much

532
00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:03,710
Okay, did these explode? I'm not gonna try it you're do this. Oh, damn. You look great. Hey

533
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:08,110
Oh, wait, are we leaving without Vinny? You ever do this?

534
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:14,670
This make look like it's made of rubber. Yep. Yeah, I've done that. Yeah. Oh, yeah

535
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:20,389
You know, we're doing it. I people used to think I was a warlock in second grade when I figured that one out

536
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:22,389
Yeah, I got all the ladies with

537
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:28,230
Do you remember the origami or not origami but you'd make like a thing where you could tell fortunes where you'd open it up

538
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah, now, how about this rubber pencil origami paper and you draw the crazy ass on it

539
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Yeah, oh

540
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:52,739
God was that oh my god

541
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:55,559
This thing's like coming out of the wall. I

542
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,829
Thought that was the character very close in my character's ear when you just did that

543
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:08,550
Thanks, I guess I was actually that was phenomenal

544
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:17,739
Well, this thing has a face

545
00:53:19,179 --> 00:53:23,070
Look into these dudes do this is freaky. What is this thing?

546
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:27,710
What I just do

547
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:35,179
Look the eye and now I'm gonna use that fridge more bro. Oh the music's gonna kick it now. It's sick. I

548
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,420
Think this is the song that woke me up from bed. I was in this song came on and my eyes went wide open

549
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:44,159
Yeah, if this does not have no choice, but they give up and play too well dog

550
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:51,929
Oh

551
00:53:54,409 --> 00:53:57,150
Dog it went through a wall dog

552
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,760
Okay, it came from a these we got to be careful up here these like holes in the walls up there

553
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:10,480
Those vents they spawn. Oh god. It's a little sus, but they spawn and what is this? Yeah, it's gross

554
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,320
Oh, look at this face. This is so cool. I mean, where's heresy but

555
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:20,639
In the face

556
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,110
I would take a piece of this off and I love what you're using a shovel

557
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,909
It's like black mold but actual sentient chaos God

558
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:40,730
It looks so friendly though. This on the hard difficulties would probably be very very difficult

559
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:47,329
It is so fun on the hard difficulties man. It's not we got to try it communicate constantly. Yeah, we should really try it

560
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:51,190
Grab that when you can your health. There's a health thing. I tagged

561
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,730
Bridges I

562
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:08,309
Look a little laser gun you got you might get one. You might be able to unlock one. I want out here

563
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:13,650
Do you not have any guns German? No, I have I have one gun. It's one. It's a one-shot shotgun. Oh

564
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,230
Gotcha. How did you get up there? I

565
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:17,869
walked

566
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:23,289
There a staircase or ladder. It's a staircase. Oh, I see ya

567
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,119
evil carnival music

568

There's actually a song in the

573
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,340
Identical to that. It's like do you guys remember one of my favorite parts of vermin tide?

00:55:52,340 --> 00:56:00,099
Which is the other the other game like this right was when the rats would spawn it would be like rap rap rap rap

And then they would start charging. Yeah, I was awesome. You can like hear them chanting this part of it

576
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:09,179
Not that

It would be snot sausage that would be dangerous yo, this guy's mad chillin look

597

Hi, I knew I wasn't gonna do it I wasn't gonna do it somebody else I had to I had to

598
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:19,079
Took his head off. So I the thing is I'm kind of confused is like I on the map

599
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:23,380
It's giving us directions, but I don't know which way this is trying to get us to go. I'm having this like a bug

600
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:27,880
Wait, how do you see the man? We just started? I don't think there's

601
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:34,239
It's just up he's gonna go up this looks amazing. Look at this. Oh

602
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,480
No hazard signs

603
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:44,659
This is an OSHA violation. He's a guy weird guy

604
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:52,889
Bad hair

605
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:59,090
That machinery is like I would lose a hand to that. I would lose probably one or two

606
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:03,409
Everything here looks so dangerous

607
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:09,579
Meaty and dangerous. Yeah, there's the face

608
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:27,760
Data relay, I love the combos you can do like I can slap light swing heavy swing. It's fun. Yeah

609
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:36,699
some of the other weapons to like I'm using like a knife for example, and it's just incredibly fast swinging and you can like mix it up with

610
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:38,980
The overhead and a sweeping attack

611
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:41,929
There's something

612
00:59:41,929 --> 00:59:45,010
What are they called chain swords in this universe? Yeah

613
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:50,969
There was one that they gave me in the tutorial and I was like, yeah, I need that. All right, we're gonna turn this off

614
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,559
Why was it doing? I don't know. It's a turn it off

615
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:59,969
Out of transition, I think it's over here. This is a reticle transmission

616
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,000
Hate that. Oh

617
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:11,949
Hold for signal. Oh, all right. We got let's group up on the way behind you. Oh, this is bad. All right

618
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:15,230
That's it. Let's turn out the flame up

619
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:20,920
Posted a good night. Hey lad. We got a weird guy over here

620
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:23,880
weird guy

621
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:31,630
It's this thing is just screaming

622
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,139
You know, you know, I'll tell you let me tell you about this game

623
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:40,500
There's a lot of activity going on like this is very deep a lot of activity

624
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,860
stimulation

625
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,599
It's kind of uh, it's kind of sick

626
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:52,639
but you get into the swing of it like I um last night I was like

627
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:58,960
Really just I hit like a weird flow state. Yeah, where my mind left my body and I just like

628
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,400
100% I think that's my favorite part of this game. It's like let's see hit that

629
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,400
Somebody just sniped me in the head. There's a sniper over there

630
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:12,630
So you can you can actually dodge their bullets because right before they fire you hear a sound

631
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:17,389
Your scope and then if you dodge left or right you won't get hit

632
01:01:23,469 --> 01:01:26,349
Music sounds like rocks or the rock and roll clown. Oh

633
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,059
Oh

634
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,760
What is it I think that's my character I picked a voice that was really like

635
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:41,820
Oh, it's you. Okay over here. Oh, all right. Let's get out of maybe wait, maybe it's not me

636
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:45,659
No, you think the flame is my talks flamer

637
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:47,659
I

638
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:57,179
Might be the same actor

639
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,780
We need to Google this

640
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:04,699
In this universe, I don't want to I want to be more you're gonna use a skull. It'll fly off

641
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:12,539
I'm playing guys

642
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,059
You're so big

643
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:23,079
My hand is really sweaty

644
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:30,159
All right. Now you do unlock the store. So now we get some items

645
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,119
Yes, you can now purchase a weapon of choice

646
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:42,840
Perfect. This is a big decision. I got a hellbore Lays gun

647
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:54,590
2,500 bucks game looks cool game is cool. Actually

648
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,480
Actually, very cool. We got confirmation that it's not the voice of Rox. Oh, okay. Oh

649
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,239
I don't want to play this anymore

650
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,489
What do I go for this flashlight

651
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:18,639
We definitely need flashlights. Yeah, we all go go buy flashlights. So it's certain weapons have them the last gun

652
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:23,679
I think is the main one but there's also others that have it. So where's the story? We unlock it right now

653
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:25,679
All right, so follow me

654
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,199
Like it's just to the right over here I looked a super imposed

655
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,960
Yeah to the left. Sorry, not right

656
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:40,869
Which one?

657
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:47,159
Requisition weapons and curios. Oh god my damn headset

658
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:55,480
When you click the weapon look on the at the three icons and you'll see the one all the way on the right will look

659
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,480
like a flashlight

660
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,920
Well, this is my

661
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,440
Again, I want to just want to say thanks again to Warhammer for sponsoring the stream

662
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:07,599
Games really fun. That's obviously the first mission, but let's keep going

663
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,159
This is beta right now you can pre-order it right now the beta

664
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:17,150
Game launches on the 30th, but go on access to the beta. You can pre-order it right now

665
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:20,039
Game is pretty sick. I

666
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:23,989
Go I look at myself in the mirror for two hours every day

667
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:29,280
Oh, wow, how I warm up or should I get the axe instead check? I

668
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:34,489
Like your hair too. Thanks. Apparently I made

669
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:42,130
Hi Chachi, I gotta reckon with the armor out this way over here smell the revolver seems fun

670
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:50,719
You really do look like count Olaf

671
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,679
So embarrassing

672
01:04:53,679 --> 01:05:02,070
What's the difference between these knives and sword for wards acts for single target? I like your tattoo. What's it mean?

673
01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:10,639
Emperor these are these like not are these different rarities or something? Well, there's different rare numbers are level this like

674
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:20,719
Yeah, I get but you'll basically gonna level up every mission you do and so you'll be able to get new stuff in the shop

675
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:23,360
Every time what do I have? Yeah, what do I have right now?

676
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:34,150
All right, so damage is a little bit lower, but mobility is higher range is higher stopping powers higher reload speed is lower

677
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:44,579
I love this one. Oh, okay, tiny range tons more damage tons more real. Okay. I don't know get the shovel

678
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:50,000
Oh, wow. I don't look like I'm wearing pajamas anymore

679
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:54,940
Did you get pants are still my pants are still pajamas. Never mind a lot of crowd control

680
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:58,980
What does night get a knife? I want to cleave damage

681
01:05:59,179 --> 01:06:04,739
What everyone has the most cleaved evan just one good bringing the thunder hammer

682
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:09,860
But if you want I would kind of recommend maybe a range weapon too, especially one with a flashlight

683
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:15,800
I don't think any of these have a flash. I do. I know I don't think Ogren gets flashlights. Unfortunately

684
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:24,960
All right, I'm going with super cleave damage I'm bringing a flashlight though, so we'll have some more

685
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:32,559
Do I look cool walking slow like this you look sick my friend?

686
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:40,610
You can inspect it too, are we doing the dark mission again right after this or are we doing something else?

687
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:45,869
I'm gonna do a dark mission. Let's do the dark mission. Yeah, okay. Let's do the one that power supply one

688
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:52,219
Well, it's gonna be really I think funny for your guys first experience in all these levels to be with no lights on

689
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,929
Nice. All right, cool. You have two options for dark missions

690
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:05,010
Yeah, let's do let's do the put the power supply one is the one that they just added right let's do that one

691
01:07:05,409 --> 01:07:10,050
Yes, but we it's a power supply. It's the dark mission with two different main objectives

692
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,650
So two different levels that oh dark mission on it. So

693
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:19,539
either do one where we're going after assassinating a target or

694
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,820
We're trying to repair

695
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:29,900
Like a train assassinate. Let's do that way and do it. Let's do it on normal. Let's actually let's let's let's turn it up a little

696
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:36,079
Yeah, I don't difficultly too. Yeah, it'll be it'll be too difficult. Yeah. All right ready when you guys are I'm ready

697
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:40,460
I'm ready, too

698
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:46,940
So if you when you guys accept just double check that you you got the same the weapons you want

699
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:53,940
Yeah, open your inventory. Make sure it's in. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, so I'm doing a beer

702
01:08:05,329 --> 01:08:07,329
I love your knife

703
01:08:08,409 --> 01:08:13,090
Yeah, I know what you mean it's one of those like illusion photos and yeah

704
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:17,689
I bet if we flip that over if we got some Photoshop specialist to somehow flip that

705
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:27,569
Yeah, I bet the beer you just got Mandela affected yeah, I had like selective memory and removed his beard and Photoshop my eyes

706
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,930
Yeah, chat my pistol has a flashlight

707
01:08:33,369 --> 01:08:39,210
That's good, so did we at least one or two of us have light right yeah, we'll be

708
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:45,930
Flashlight. Oh, yeah, that's been all my money on a flashlight. I'm just swinging a knife in the dark. Whatever

709
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:55,590
Well, you guys look cool a cannon. You guys got different clothes, too. Yeah, Vinny's got a shirt

710
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,750
Basically wearing what I'm wearing

Able flashlight

712
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:10,359
Yeah, it's like your secondary mouse button. Oh, no, never mind. I don't have a light. Oh, no

I'll be in the back charges in for

718
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:47,899
Well, I realized I don't have any weapons that can shoot more than 10 feet in front of it

719
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:51,180
It's like oh god, it's so creepy when they activate

720
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:05,840
This is so much scarier without being able to see

721
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:12,020
We can all take my guns with my gun if we need I

722
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,560
Keep forgetting that I'm one of the flashlight guys

723
01:10:17,239 --> 01:10:19,960
It's like I switched to melee. I'm like why'd it get dark? Oh

724
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:26,350
There's a person. Oh

725
01:10:26,909 --> 01:10:28,909
You're so quiet, too

726
01:10:28,949 --> 01:10:34,439
What was that how?

727
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:36,479
Probably just a puppy

728
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:45,609
All right step

729
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:52,609

01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:56,289

01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:07,890
We stay together we have to stay together because we have the regeneration right? Yeah, it'll believe you

733
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:12,340
Oh

734
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,770
My god, I'm dead

735
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:18,409
Shit. Oh my god. I'm down

736
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:24,170
Ogre was very powerful. That guy is hitting one hit kill. Holy shit

737
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:27,510

Yeah, guys. It's crazy. These guys are targeting me

740
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:44,020
Did they're they're all they're toxic. I mean, they probably read the lore right? He's the main character you guys doing good on ammo

741
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:48,149
Yeah

742
01:11:50,829 --> 01:11:58,409
Did we slay the bomber or did the bomber explode on you we got him from a distance I think yeah, he's right here

743
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:02,600
This is a tiny skull. This is a child skull

744
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,279
You know what that checks out for the Warhammer universe, yeah

745
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:14,479
So dark good our dark dream is lagging a bit. No

746
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
That's a possibility

747
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,720
How did you get up here

748
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:34,899
You know, honestly, these are these are voice lines you say in the mirror

749
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:55,609
Weird guy over here. Yeah big guy. I definitely need something like that like I'm down

750
01:12:56,489 --> 01:12:59,329
Wow, that's gonna be coming. That's gonna be using a lot

751
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:02,859
In your everyday life, there's that ammo. Yeah

752
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,779
Yeah, that that's got some. Oh my god sniper

753
01:13:07,659 --> 01:13:09,659
Yeah, I can't snipe them anymore

754
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:15,279
How many of you guys walked around saying Thanos lines from Infinity War after Infinity War came up?

755
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:21,180
Come on a little bit not as much as the Joker when Dark Knight came out

756
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,579
Was that and more at we're just like

757
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,220
We were the annoying guys

758
01:13:28,859 --> 01:13:34,199
But I did reduce to Adams was a bit of a favorite of mine

759
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:43,180
This is kind of scary. What's the sound? This is this is the talks person. It's the one that explodes and it gets too close

760
01:13:43,979 --> 01:13:46,539
Keep an eye out. Oh

761
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:54,180
I don't know where he is. I don't see it. I'm quiet. Oh my god. I see the health station guys

762
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,180
I'm gonna make a run for it

763
01:13:56,939 --> 01:13:58,939
Careful easy

764
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:06,979
Watch out

765
01:14:06,979 --> 01:14:09,260
explosive barrel if anyone needs it, there's there's a

766
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,020
little bit of ammo

767
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:22,140
Just like clunking him in the head. Oh

768
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:30,979
The melee is better for the armored guys know I'm trying to hit him directly in the face

769
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:35,899
If you have like an axe that's our piercing if you have like yeah, my axe is probably pretty good for that

770
01:14:36,699 --> 01:14:39,000
So this healing station is should I take this?

771
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:45,060
Yeah, yeah for sure. This is you you'll recover that. Oh my god. It's him again. Oh god

772
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,060
All right, we gotta fight fight fight fight fight

773
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:51,520
I'm taking up my cube. It's going for me going for me going for me. I missed

774
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:59,850
You throw a box for me. Oh my god. What's he doing? He's sucking you see he's sucking out your soul. Oh god

775
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:04,050
Stop it. Leave him alone. He gave me put him down

776
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:13,149
Oh my goodness, I can't believe I'm dead. I can't believe you he's almost dead

777
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:15,149
Oh

778
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:29,579
There's a chat member that said that this thing is like the witch from left for dead and you should avoid

779
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,180
Yeah, we got it

780
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:35,449
Coming snot

781
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:42,449
Nothing's over here. Um, you want the honest truth? I think I think that was unrelated to the enemies

782
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:50,260
Tired that was actually that was a great voice line if I die here, I'll haunt you forever

783
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:59,659
Anyone that went down should uh, what is that guy doing? I'm totally like eliminated, but you guys will find me at some point

784
01:15:59,659 --> 01:16:06,340
I'll find you soon. Should I do this down someone? He just literally sucks the life out of me like that's insane. All right

785
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:10,210
All right. I can't see what did you say?

786
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:13,010

01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:44,479
Like this place it's got lights take them grenades I could definitely use some health

792
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:47,119
Oh, there's a health kit thing. Somebody picked one up

793
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:55,159

Ouch. Oh my god that freaking

Did we start the thing I think it's going in my accident

797
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:20,689
Well, I say by accident, but I didn't know what it did. Oh my god, that hurts

798
01:17:21,369 --> 01:17:27,260
All right, might have to use cover here because there's a lot of range guys. Yeah, there's a lot shot at things

799
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:32,630
Unless you're smushed then you're you're shadow luck. I'm gonna try to wrap around

800
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:48,569
Step up turn music. Okay

I found him. I think I found him. Did you get him?

806
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:19,010
So Trevor your class has like a head-popping ability you use that yet

807
01:18:25,829 --> 01:18:31,189
Yeah, so if it reaches like a hundred then you blow up but if you use your ultimate then it vents it and also

808
01:18:35,029 --> 01:18:37,029
Thanks guys

809
01:18:38,029 --> 01:18:42,750
Yeah, I keep forgetting to use my ability I'll try to remember chat I just

01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:04,560
This this voice sounds like beep oh from Mario and Rabbids chat

811
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:10,699
Is those good those games fun I loved Mario and Rabbids it's just you know, it's it's like XCOM light

01:19:10,699 --> 01:19:12,699
I'm in real time. It's really

813
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:17,020
Yeah, I had no idea what the gameplay was like for that game. Especially the new one

814
01:19:17,779 --> 01:19:23,260
It's dope. I don't know why I'm saying sick and dope so much. I feel like it's the 90s part two for me lately, but

815
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:28,020
But really no, it's awesome. I really enjoy the Mario Rabbids games. Oh

816
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:31,020

Kraken that does sound exactly like you when you do that. That's actually unbelievable

820
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,229
the voice

821
01:19:56,430 --> 01:20:01,069
Sometimes I actually think it's you doing it and now we fight for the emperor

822
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:07,630
Yeah, that's oh my god. There's too many of them perfect. That looked like it was a like a body waterfall

823
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:09,909
Yeah, good drop in like water. That was creepy

824
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:15,720
Doesn't matter if I can't see

825
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,180
Yeah, I'm out of ammo guys, that's gotta go away for now

826
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:24,779
Corruption I should have let snot get that ammo. All right

827
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:28,659
We got to find some ammo for snot for flashlight purposes, right?

828
01:20:28,659 --> 01:20:34,939
I think I found something this looks like promising over here. You want to see this guys? It's ammo. Good news. Get it. Oh, yeah

829
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:43,140

Parking lot press 3 to deploy ammo. Oh fuck. I have ammo this whole time

834
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:39,470
Snot could have used that

835
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:42,630
It's not my fault

836
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
We do reaction

837
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:05,659
What it's over that direction, I think it's it's the demonic hosts corruption

838
01:22:07,659 --> 01:22:11,800
Don't go in there man, we can avoid it we can avoid it telling you don't go in there man

Guess so maybe you can start seeing their little skeletons whenever they're hurt. Oh, yeah, like the thing through the the

852
01:23:38,109 --> 01:23:43,630
Yeah, I see your skeleton right now. Yeah, I think it's the color of your heart is how much healthy you've got

853
01:23:43,909 --> 01:23:45,909
That's actually pretty cool

854
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:51,229
All right. We have to go back in the room with the weird guy. I think so when we stuck the wrong direction

882
01:26:11,149 --> 01:26:13,050
Jesus I

883
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:20,140
Think we have to just just rush in there. I'm going around it. I wonder what the aggro range is on it

884
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:25,159
It's the other way. It sucks like you get hit. Oh

885
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:29,279
on that

886
01:26:30,279 --> 01:26:33,029
Yeah, I was getting hit while crushed behind cover

887
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:37,760
All right. I think we're all right. Keep an eye on it. I think we're okay

888
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:46,600
It might just be the like the icy ground that activates it when you stand on top of it. That's true or attacking it. Yeah

889
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:49,600
That doesn't sound good

890
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,560
Yeah, either there's like there's something going on behind us. Oh, that's scary

891
01:27:05,239 --> 01:27:07,409
All right, it's time to use the axe

892
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:11,319
There are too many people down here, dude. There are

893
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:20,640
This is a fire hazard and my axe

894
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:24,100
My bum and my bum

895
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:32,989
I'm on solo. Oh wait wrong wrong song. Is that that the cranberries?

896
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:42,000
Zombie I don't know where I'm going. There's a healing thing here if anyone needs it. Oh between you and

897
01:27:45,899 --> 01:27:47,899
Salve salve

898
01:27:55,750 --> 01:28:00,789
Creepy church. No. Oh, I feel like this game is just metal and creepy churches

899
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:03,550
Oh, no, what do you pull me up? I

900
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:09,500
Keep trying to jump on top of stuff and it vaults me over it. Somebody keeps throwing grenades at us

901
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:21,800
This place is giving me real creepy vibes everyone. I love how you said the barrel explodes and not even a second later it exploded

902
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,619
I hear somebody big weird guy weird guy

903
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:27,439
We got a weird guy. I

904
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,560
Said swatch to do that

905
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:37,880
There's an eye on his arm. Is it that an eyeball? Oh, no. Oh, yeah, that's chaos corruption

906
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:43,989
That's why we're gonna you just described all of warhammer 40k. What metal and religion? Yes

907
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:49,470
Pretty much yes and dirt a little dirt. It's cool, though. I

908
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:56,149
Really hope they're gonna add a tech freeze later the ones that like literally just pray to the machine spirit and they're like

909
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:58,710
my gun works because

910
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,710
I'm getting zapped by this thing

911
01:29:03,789 --> 01:29:07,590
Now are there any giant sand worms in the dune in the sorry

912
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:13,149
What are you applying him in the wrong universe? Sorry about that

913
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:28,529
Group up ammo here. I get one stick with a knife

914
01:29:29,149 --> 01:29:32,710
What is your watch get that that's large rafting later on crafting?

915
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:35,149
Yeah, then you get to like

916
01:29:35,149 --> 01:29:44,640
Craft weapons and stuff. I think cranking is that correct you craft weapons or you re craft them or something?

917
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,640
Yeah, you don't both you get like

918
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,119
if you think of every weapon you get is like a template and then

919
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,180
Create your own and try like reroll to get specific modifiers for it

920
01:29:54,640 --> 01:30:02,029
That's okay. My knife has like bleed on hit and so I build this like if I hit a bleeding enemy

921
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:03,670
I get higher crit chance

922
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:06,789
So the stuff happens when I crit so then I just have like a crit

923
01:30:08,189 --> 01:30:10,189
Well, what's that? Oh, dude

924
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:17,149
It's similar to vermin tide a bunch of lads over here

925
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:22,750
Yeah, yeah, I thought it was a rat extermination game

926
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:27,069
I didn't know it was warhammer related for like a while because everybody's been you need to play vermin hide

927
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:30,670
No, thanks

928
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,800
Hope I'm all right big guy

929
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:41,279
Tyranids have giant sandworms

930
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,079
Said oh

931
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,880
Sorry guys, she's dead over here. We gotta help them. Oh

932
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,880
Stop actually hoping around electrocuted. Did you not hear it in my voice?

933
01:30:54,439 --> 01:30:56,840
But I'm not smush is gonna do it. I got smush

934
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,760
The cleave on this is actually huge. It's funny

935
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:22,239
I'll tank I'll tank I'll tank taunting taunting taunting. I think I think he picks one person in

936
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,199
Down here

937
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:29,199

I'm kind of hurting

948
01:32:18,939 --> 01:32:21,899
Did it work? Yeah, sure. Yeah, you just gotta stand in the smelly air

949
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:25,020
I bet this would feel so excellent

950
01:32:25,739 --> 01:32:29,979
Right, can you imagine having that air would feel like throwing one of these down? It's like a

951
01:32:30,939 --> 01:32:32,939
Future vix vapor rub. I've had enough

952
01:32:34,699 --> 01:32:46,140

I'm gonna try to infiltrate his mind with my powers

959
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:32,970
All right, we're good. Look I I want to switch to melee more but then everything gets dark

960
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:35,210
Okay, I need to be the team light

961
01:33:35,609 --> 01:33:39,689
It's very very helpful. I was about to say I don't know how much it's helping

962
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:43,840
It's helping. Is it like pretty visible? Oh, yeah. No, it's great

963
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:49,119
It's actually when I turn my light off and I just look around at yours. I can it's tremendously helpful

964
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:54,800
All right. Here's the way out and also a medical station and ammunition. I don't know why I said like that

967
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:14,239

Oh, yeah, I i'm sorry chat. I have to apologize to my chat too. I forgot about them for a bit

970
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:26,159
It's very easy to just get like tunnel vision in this game

971
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,880
When we were playing among us vr

972
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:31,149
like

973
01:34:31,149 --> 01:34:34,189
You're a you're in vr b you're being terrorized by charborg

974
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:37,149
right like

975
01:34:37,149 --> 01:34:40,270
So much going on it was hard to imagine chat was even there

976
01:34:41,069 --> 01:34:44,989
Yeah, if there's too much going on I just my brain shuts down and I can't

977
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:48,510
This is just ignore chat night

978
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:50,510
unfortunate

979
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:52,510
Yeah chat is the the uh

980
01:34:53,149 --> 01:34:55,149
The odd man out so to speak

01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:00,430
All right time for me to say my next line

983
01:35:01,069 --> 01:35:03,069
Never mind. Does the boss

Yeah, this music is also awesome

995
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:49,340
This is the one that does the thing german was doing

996
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:57,000
It sounds like they're saying this is halloween

997
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:06,279
Reload the gun

998
01:36:06,279 --> 01:36:08,279
Reload the i'm gonna put healing down on the boss

999
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:14,239
I had a version of that halloween song for statin island. It went like this

1000
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:18,399
This is parker said this is parker said parker said parker said

1001
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,520
There was a bit of a parker set problem here like 10 years ago. So

1002
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,640
Shields down. I thought it was being funny. It was mean

1003
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:43,470
Oh fuck you want to go blow for blow, let's go everyone make a scream make a scream

1004
01:36:49,949 --> 01:36:53,970
Keep keep killing them everybody do a voice line from your character

1005
01:37:00,029 --> 01:37:02,029
We did it good job everyone

1006
01:37:04,119 --> 01:37:08,119
Thank you. Was that good enough? Oh, that was good. All right, good. Let's wrap up

1007
01:37:10,829 --> 01:37:13,069
Oh my god, that guy turned into just gibs

1008
01:37:15,899 --> 01:37:17,579
Grub hubba salami

1009
01:37:17,579 --> 01:37:20,319
on me

1010
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:22,319
That was cool. That was fun

1011
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:29,359
That was you just got possessed

1012
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:31,359
That looks so good do higher difficulty

1013
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:35,760
Well, we we need to get our our levels up a little and unlock a few weapons

1014
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:40,640
I wouldn't try it the next difficulty until like at least level five. Yeah

1015
01:37:42,409 --> 01:37:44,890
I got a level five unlock like skills and stuff

1016
01:37:45,869 --> 01:37:47,869
All right, that thing looks pretty amazing

1017
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:53,689
The calm chatter doesn't meet e3 quality standards

1018
01:37:55,239 --> 01:38:02,039
Oh, we can do an e3 freaking calm chatter. We could easily now. We absolutely could for sure. We're all very very familiar

1019
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:09,470
Copernicus i've got a tango on my six. I'm gonna go look at this new weapon

1020
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,720
And i'm also gonna make sure to tell you guys that again warhammer sponsored this stream

1021
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,720
uh

1022
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,720
Games actually really goddamn fun

1023
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:24,779
Um, it's available if you pre-order it, uh, this is the beta the game comes out on the 30th

1024
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:31,130
Four player co-op played vermintide. It's it's kind of in that same world

1025
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:39,710
Also warhammer and let's keep going. It's been pretty fun so far

1026
01:38:41,079 --> 01:38:45,239
Pants are like this gold standard of like this game's economy

1027
01:38:46,039 --> 01:38:48,039
All right, I want to see that gun

1028
01:38:50,039 --> 01:38:52,279
Oh my god, you're you're right. They're so expensive

1029
01:38:53,079 --> 01:38:55,640
I want to look at that thing

1030
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:03,710
If yeah 15 000, i'm gonna look like a dweeb forever. Yeah 20 000

1031
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:07,449
Wait, where did you buy your shirt from?

1032
01:39:07,449 --> 01:39:13,579
It was just in the character creator. Well, you can change your shirt in the character creator

1033
01:39:13,579 --> 01:39:18,060
Yeah, also the character creator has a bunch of personality questions that I was not prepared for

1034
01:39:19,579 --> 01:39:23,979
I can't I don't think it does that matter. Does that add anything to your character? Uh, it's your voice

1035
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,140
uh lines

1036
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:27,020
Really?

1037
01:39:29,239 --> 01:39:35,340
That that's actually pretty cool because honestly it's like a 10 question survey that you take when you make your character

1038
01:39:35,579 --> 01:39:44,460
I definitely needed a gun

1039
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,619
How often should you uh buy better?

1040
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:50,270
guns and all that

1041
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:51,229
um

1042
01:39:51,229 --> 01:39:54,619
I'd say like every other level

1043
01:39:54,699 --> 01:39:58,539
At this point is probably good good or if you literally just want to try a new type of weapon

1044
01:39:58,619 --> 01:40:01,420
I'd say like just buy buy it. It's never a bad idea

1045
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:11,399
Yeah, I have a nice variety now. I'm pretty happy with that because eventually you're gonna start buying them to craft them into better gear

1046
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,579
Will you break them down?

1047
01:40:13,579 --> 01:40:19,979
Yes, you can you can break them down to get money or you can use them as raw materials to craft a better

1048
01:40:20,539 --> 01:40:22,539
Version of whatever that weapon is

1049
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:25,500
I have like three different knives because knives are my favorite

1050
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:30,699
So I was like i'll buy a bunch so that I have options when i'm upgrading them. How do you?

1051
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:33,020
How do you break the old one down?

1052
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,500
If you go into your inventory and then click on it and then hold x it'll discard

1053
01:40:40,619 --> 01:40:43,020
I should yeah, this is the slowest reload ever

1054
01:40:43,899 --> 01:40:48,460
Oh, that's how you get a gun actually shoots through look at that. It actually hits more than one target

1055
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:52,319
Cool

1056
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:55,279
Go to the training area. Oh, that's where you guys are, right? Right? Where are you?

1057
01:40:56,079 --> 01:41:01,149
Yeah, i'm in the training area

1058
01:41:01,149 --> 01:41:04,989
Where is that at compared to the little the walt disneyland place?

1059
01:41:05,869 --> 01:41:07,609
um

1060
01:41:07,609 --> 01:41:09,609
Oh god, I don't even know how to explain it

1061
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:15,130
I've got a good imagination. I'll probably just imagine how my gun would shoot shrine of the

1062
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:17,369
Om nissiah, what is this?

1063
01:41:18,170 --> 01:41:20,590
need to be level four

1064
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:22,670
His dude's name is how do I play this game?

1065
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:31,199
He's level 10. He seems to have a pretty good grasp trust him. Yes. Trust that chat member that viewer that uh player. Oh my god

1066
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:40,590
I'm fine. It's the mini stroke. It's an upgrade station. Oh, that's when you get to do that. All right, so right here

1067
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:48,430
Yeah, this revolver is fucking awesome r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1

1068
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:57,180
I can do like one more

1069
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:01,340
If you guys are okay with one more. Oh, yeah, i'm i'm i'm gonna play this for at least the next hour

1070
01:42:01,979 --> 01:42:07,439
Yeah, okay, because I I have a I have an engagement. I must go to congratulations

1071
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,460
No, no, it's just a

1072
01:42:10,939 --> 01:42:12,619
It's a friends giving

1073
01:42:12,619 --> 01:42:17,500
Um, oh cool. Also, there's my my other friends are doing a charity stream today. So i'm gonna be

01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:27,500
Only an hour. No, i'm i'm i'm down to play

1076
01:42:29,289 --> 01:42:34,479
Um, you guys okay finding a replacement after I leave we can also just maybe do randoms

1077
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:41,050
It doesn't really matter right? No, probably not. Yeah, I got some people that are down to play I think

1078
01:42:41,449 --> 01:42:44,090
Yeah, everyone to just come on in that's easy

1079
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:50,779
Should I get

1080
01:42:50,779 --> 01:42:52,779
What's uh, what's the mission that we should do?

1081
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:56,680
Uh, I can do you want to keep doing dark ones or do you want to do one?

1082
01:42:57,399 --> 01:43:01,079
That let's do let's do a normal. Let's do a normal one. Yeah, I want to see for a little bit

1083
01:43:01,979 --> 01:43:08,779
Yeah, uh chat member I meant raid I forgot the um, I say host still because i've been saying it for like years

1084
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:14,140
But uh, yeah, they got rid of that feature. So i'll raid let's start gone. Is there another one with the boss? The bosses are fun

1085
01:43:14,699 --> 01:43:23,819
There's there's weird. What's that weird slug thing? Criken, you know that that like slug boss that showed the beast of miracle

1086
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:27,500
Yeah, I love that thing. So the lore of that thing is he uh,

1087
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:33,420
He just wants a hug like he's just friendly and like wants that like, you know, like a golden retriever, you know

1088
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,739
Like he just wants to hug you i'll give him a hug

1089
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:42,220
But he's incredibly poisonous and also eats you accent something else that i'm realizing right now, too

1090
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:45,260
Which is interesting. So these missions up here

1091
01:43:45,739 --> 01:43:49,819
They reset or refresh every 10 to 15 minutes or something. Yeah

1092
01:43:50,439 --> 01:43:53,159
Interesting, so you'll always have new things

1093
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:56,140
Huh?

1094
01:43:56,140 --> 01:44:03,369
Oh one just it's literally just happened. I saw that. Yeah. Yeah, it just happened. What so we could do

1095
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:08,140
Uh, I don't think we've done this mission yet. What's the what's a raid?

1096
01:44:10,189 --> 01:44:16,829
That's a difficulty one, but that one's a fun level. So unfortunately, I don't have it on two right now, but okay

1097
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:20,189
Let's do another one place in like a pleasant location

1098
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:23,210
Not really pleasant

1099
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,579
One takes place in a chuck-e-cheese ball pit

1100
01:44:28,539 --> 01:44:32,939
This is a huge ball pit. It's the whole level which is to say that it's a pit of disease

1101
01:44:32,939 --> 01:44:38,399
Which is what this game is about. I was about to say make sure you uh equip your weapons. Thanks

1102
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:47,159
Yeah, I got my revolver somebody said why am I playing as the amish hulk?

1103
01:44:51,369 --> 01:44:57,069
I love you. I love every weapon. I've seen you have I love it. Look at this big giant knife

1104
01:44:59,819 --> 01:45:05,180
Yeah, it's like it's like the hulk's brother, right? They like they went like separate ways in life. Yeah the hulk

1105
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,279
And they have to go

1106
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:14,239
They have to go convince the amish hulk to like come on man. We need you

1107
01:45:15,739 --> 01:45:20,060
And he's like he's like putting a wheelbarrow with butter in it. He doesn't want anything to do with it

1108
01:45:20,619 --> 01:45:23,579
He refuses to ride the train to get out of retirement

1109
01:45:24,779 --> 01:45:27,399
He walks there

1110
01:45:27,399 --> 01:45:31,600
We need you amish hulk credible hulk

1111
01:45:34,270 --> 01:45:36,109
The credible hulk

1112
01:45:36,109 --> 01:45:40,989
I just borrowed that from a chat member. Um, apparently the hulk are a real thing in 40k

1113
01:45:41,069 --> 01:45:46,510
So I accidentally what chat when you have lore the size of 45 bibles

1114
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:52,590
There's going to be something for anything. You just save something and you know, what is this? It's probably true

1115
01:45:52,989 --> 01:45:55,869
Everything's make-believe words guys. Oh I can stab

1116
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:59,960
The blimpticus are real

1117
01:46:02,039 --> 01:46:08,039
I'm so glad I can see

1118
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:11,880
My god this environment

1119
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,680
Although those people

1120
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:19,479
What was oh those are on our side. They're like the ones sending us in or basically the suicide squad, right? So

1121
01:46:20,119 --> 01:46:22,119
They're like, oh, okay

1122
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:25,399
That's right. Yeah, because you yeah, I know the prologue, right?

1123
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:35,359
And you can appreciate the level with all the lights in it, I guess I can hit fire

1124
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:37,369
I don't have to just stabilize it

1125
01:46:37,369 --> 01:46:40,890
It's nice that I can like switch to a weapon that doesn't have a flashlight now

1126
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:44,250
This thing is so much better than the thing. I just was using

1127
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:47,210
By a long shot

1128
01:46:47,369 --> 01:46:51,369
No, is that the three round burst one? It is. Yep. Yeah, I like that one

1129
01:46:53,789 --> 01:46:55,789
Maybe i'm just not using the other one correctly

1130
01:46:57,039 --> 01:47:01,710
Actually shouldn't even be using it right now

1131
01:47:02,109 --> 01:47:16,060
Oh, your voice is terrifying. I love it. I need I need a little help guys. What's up, buddy?

1132
01:47:16,779 --> 01:47:18,460
um

1133
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:24,140
There's just some dudes that were just I I don't know one guy this guy giving me trouble they hurt

1134
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:28,300
All right, i'm good now, thank you

1135
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:32,989
You need to block and shove occasionally. Yeah

1136
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,079
I don't block and shove and i'm doing just fine

1137
01:47:43,079 --> 01:47:46,810
This thing is sec

1138
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:49,609
Oh criken, do you like um, do you like city builders?

1139
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:52,810
city builder

1140
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:56,890
I don't know builder d's nuts like any city builder type game. Oh my god. He got me you're right

1141
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:03,359
Uh, oh you mean like um, just the genre of games in general. Yeah that genre

1142
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:06,880
Uh, yeah, I I played uh, let's go

1143
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,199
Okay

1144
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:12,720
I don't know if I got a game. I got a game recommend my channel. Oh god. Here we go

1145
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:17,520
Well, I got a good game recommendation. It's a city building rogue light that I think you might like

1146
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:23,520
Shit, they're too fast city building rogue light. Yeah, it's really cool. It's my favorite game of the year so far

1147
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,039
Aside from elden ring

1148
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:26,319
Really?

1149
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:27,800
Yeah

1150
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,319
What is it called?

1151
01:48:29,319 --> 01:48:31,239
Um, I don't want to seem like a shill

1152
01:48:32,359 --> 01:48:34,359
I'm not a shill

1153
01:48:35,239 --> 01:48:40,680
I got a movie recommendation for you, but i'm not gonna tell you I can't tell you my chat will get angry. It's so awesome

1154
01:48:44,109 --> 01:48:48,670
No, it's called against the storm. I love it. I've been playing like every day. It's really good. Nice

1155
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:54,109
Yeah, i'll uh, I just want to see more people succumb to the addiction of that game

1156
01:48:54,829 --> 01:48:59,630
I think there's so many games that not recently i'm like struggling to keep up i've been playing this so much

1157
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:03,470
It's like the first hour and a half of a sim city game

1158
01:49:04,109 --> 01:49:07,949
And then you just keep doing that and it gets more complex and it's wonderful. I love it

1159
01:49:11,229 --> 01:49:14,909
Uh, can you guys do my favorite talk about this game? Oh, yeah

1160
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:20,430
Um, excuse me about this one

1161
01:49:21,149 --> 01:49:23,579
Man

1162
01:49:26,699 --> 01:49:31,020
It's funny because you really have you've been like you've been playing this a lot, you know everything

1163
01:49:32,350 --> 01:49:34,590
Look, this servitor was turned into a typewriter

1164
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:38,300
Yes, yes

1165
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:44,300
Hey, don't shoot that. This is my new favorite. I like this game because in it you get to shoot

1166
01:49:44,859 --> 01:49:46,300
That's true

1167
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:50,159
I like this game because it seems like hold on a minute. We've got an issue

1168
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:54,600
Handle this

1169
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:58,199
Our servitors by choice, uh turn into typewriters. No

1170
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,039
Okay

1171
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:02,359
It's usually if you've done a crime like stealing apple

1172
01:50:03,399 --> 01:50:06,409
or

1173
01:50:06,409 --> 01:50:08,409
You know

1174
01:50:08,409 --> 01:50:10,409
Bump into the wrong person

1175
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:12,729
Oh my god

1176
01:50:13,449 --> 01:50:16,569
So in the warhammer universe like every minor thing

1177
01:50:17,689 --> 01:50:24,649
Like not like overly minor crimes, but you can get turned into a typewriter. Yes, that's so ridiculous

1178
01:50:25,529 --> 01:50:26,890
like the

1179
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:29,210
You know, like when you're doing that personality quiz to fill out for your character

1180
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:33,689
Those were like how you ended up in this situation, right? That's no one for mine was like

1181
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:35,770
I

1182
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:43,130
Complained about the taste of corpse starch, which is what everyone's given to eat is literally like melted down people

1183
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:47,369
And I was like the corpse starch is kind of bad today and someone overheard me

1184
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:51,130
And then you got arrested. Yeah, that's how I run my

1185
01:50:51,609 --> 01:50:57,529
Colonies people just throw a fit about their bedroom and I just don't like give them peg legs

1186
01:50:58,970 --> 01:51:01,529
Yeah, and uh, not to talk about another game for too long

1187
01:51:01,609 --> 01:51:04,170
but in rimworld my chat kept wanting me to get the the

1188
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:06,970
The one where you could make people into like

1189
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:10,329
Milkable like colonists mod. Did you ever use that mod?

1190
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:14,090
Uh warhammers takes place actually guys

1191
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:15,829
in

1192
01:51:15,829 --> 01:51:19,609
4100 millennia the textures are great in this area and

1193
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:25,369
The boss we're about to fight here is who is it again? I would probably just do I don't know but is he milkable?

1194
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:30,350
Probably um, hey snot you might want this

1195
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:35,710
Yeah, I just feel bad the server the server doesn't want to be here

1196
01:51:35,869 --> 01:51:40,989
So if we complete the level finding all these scriptures, then they get bonus exp and money

1197
01:51:41,390 --> 01:51:43,710
There's a lot of people over there and i'm in trouble

1198
01:51:44,510 --> 01:51:46,640
Can I use this? What?

1199
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:49,319
It's like three stop shooting our hulk

1200
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,960
Can't count the on three though, I guess that's

1201
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Makes sense

1202
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,850
This thing is so fun

1203
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:12,729
Can I press it? Oh, wait, I don't think I should have pressed it that

1204
01:52:13,289 --> 01:52:14,890
Prested that

1205
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:19,369
I'll press the button. Why I should have should have pressed it that why am I turning english?

1206
01:52:20,090 --> 01:52:22,090
No, you're role playing you're fine

1207
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:26,590
That's the credible hurt

1208
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:36,010
I know i'm the same boat as you

1209
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:39,850
Who's gonna get it first you can have it. No, you can have it

1210
01:52:41,689 --> 01:52:43,689
You know, do you take it take it

1211
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:45,869
Okay, fine

1212
01:52:45,869 --> 01:52:46,829
Yep

1213
01:52:46,829 --> 01:52:50,189
Yeah, I guess I think you you need it more than I do because you have more suppressing fire than I do

1214
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:00,560
I like that because even when i'm missing i'm still suppressing and i'm missing the most of them

1215
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:04,479
Oh meta bullets pressing fire machine

1216
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:09,289
behind you

1217
01:53:09,289 --> 01:53:10,569
Behind you flame

1218
01:53:10,569 --> 01:53:15,930
Yikes. Oh god, i'm running behind you. You got a tox flame. I'm the tank. Why am I running flank?

1219
01:53:16,489 --> 01:53:19,289
That's another horde criken. Why is the fire green?

1220
01:53:20,010 --> 01:53:21,770
Bokeys on your sex

1221
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:24,489
Because it's a tox flamer not an actual flamer

1222
01:53:25,289 --> 01:53:27,289
Are you using toxic flame?

1223
01:53:27,369 --> 01:53:30,960
Oh, you're toxic get off the server

1224
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,989
I'm chasing this freaking guy talk more about warhammer

1225
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:42,319
What's the lore of this symbol above the door

1226
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,760
Why is the symbol of the emperor?

1227
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,159
Why do they have chainsaws on swords?

1228
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,479
That didn't kill him

1229
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:52,479
chainsaw swords

1230
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,800

1232
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:04,479
Ask criken about the arco flagellants for a good time

1233
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,479
I think your chat may assume I know more than I actually do

1234
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:13,439
Oh, no, you can just make it up and i'll yeah, you're right. You're right. I'll make it up. Uh, ask me then

1235
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:17,279
Well, um, tell tell me about the arco flagellants. Oh

01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,159
The arco flagellants. Yeah, so that's actually

1237
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:22,640
a sect of

1238
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:24,560
purple

1239
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,479
inquisitors that

1240
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:28,079
slap each other

1241
01:54:28,079 --> 01:54:30,079
in the arctic and

1242
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:32,239
That's why they're called arco flagellants

1243
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:36,079
It's nuts. I think we have to be in here, right? Yeah

1244
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:44,270
Is the up human more than beast or mutant train

1245
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:51,550
Somebody said why do I keep making the bat chest face? I haven't made the bat chest face once this whole entire day

01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:05,229
Are there clowns in this universe

1249
01:55:05,689 --> 01:55:07,069
Actually, yes

1250
01:55:07,069 --> 01:55:13,310
Insane machines by implement implanted weapons who constantly feel pain and regret in combat. There's there's like a

1251
01:55:14,189 --> 01:55:16,189
an assassination like

1254
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:35,470
They torture each other

1255
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:38,430
Do they want to be tortured? I I don't know maybe

1256
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:41,310
After a certain point, maybe you start to like it

1257
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:46,029
I don't I have no I all I know is I remember they were just like torturing each other and like tortures and shit

1258
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:49,949
I wouldn't like that

1259
01:55:49,949 --> 01:55:51,550
Uh-oh

1260
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:53,069
What's that sound?

1261
01:55:53,069 --> 01:55:55,069
Oh, you're about to find out what?

1262
01:55:55,710 --> 01:55:56,750

Oh, no

1268
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:19,180
Kind of reminds me of that movie event horizon, which is also not warhammer 40k

1269
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:25,079
What is it you hyping this up for no reason what oh my god

1270
01:56:28,119 --> 01:56:30,119

Now we should eat him

1280
01:57:33,739 --> 01:57:35,739
Yeah, that's sort of like a payback

1281
01:57:38,659 --> 01:57:42,100
I'm pretty sure you would have every infection by now. Yeah

1282
01:57:44,779 --> 01:57:46,779

I did say that unironically. I like that. That's what I was talking about before. I love that, dude

1285
01:57:55,979 --> 01:57:58,539
That's the thing about you man. You're just a walk in marvel script

1286
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:01,020

01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:58,770
I just killed a sniper

1298
01:59:04,689 --> 01:59:08,050

01:59:44,369 --> 01:59:46,369
Last deal, but you take it

1308
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:49,340
Well, that just happened

1309
01:59:49,739 --> 01:59:51,739
Uh, does anyone else see this?

1310
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:56,539
Uh, you're gonna want to see this. What are we looking at? What are we looking? What are we? What are you doing?

1311
01:59:56,859 --> 01:59:58,859
I don't know. I was a bit

1312
02:00:01,789 --> 02:00:05,310
They really should hire me for the e3 things man. You can't say shut up and then do plus two

1313
02:00:05,310 --> 02:00:10,369
That's not how it works

1314
02:00:10,369 --> 02:00:13,890
Uh, we could do it. You guys want to do an e3 segment? Yeah. All right

1315
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:18,220
We got a shotgunner

1316
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:19,500

1317
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,239
tagging

1318
02:00:21,239 --> 02:00:27,819
Reloading we're all clear. Maybe not. That's a little much. I mean, that's not quite e3. That's like just the game generic

1319
02:00:27,899 --> 02:00:33,420
I'm an npc in the video game. I thought that was in the game cover me convincing. All right

1320
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:36,939
Okay

1321
02:00:36,939 --> 02:00:38,460
We're going through

1322
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:41,020
Once this opens on the other side of that portal. I don't know

1323
02:00:41,739 --> 02:00:44,750
It's looking a little scary though

1324
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:46,800
one guy right there

1325
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,640
Nice shot. Nice

That's okay. I'll take it

1330
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:06,380
Now you're going to take it. I think you need a little bit more than we do

1331
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:08,539
Oh, that's better

1332
02:01:08,539 --> 02:01:11,619
I might need it too

1333
02:01:11,779 --> 02:01:14,289

I'm ready. It moves right here

1338
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:27,409
We need one more scripture lads and then we get them

1339

I bet you'll enjoy that when we're done with our match of warhammer 40k

1346
02:01:52,510 --> 02:01:55,869
Hey, hey come back with that pizza man. There's a lot of freaking zombies here

He actually left he's uh, oh he's he's actually it's all right guys

What is he

02:02:09,090 --> 02:02:14,770
He's doing some kind of joke. It's not done yet. It's not quite done yet

1351

Of all times. Well, welcome back german 985. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. I got a uh,

On your six group on the left. Could that be a sniper?

1358
02:02:37,069 --> 02:02:40,479

1359
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:43,600
Also, also, I know that we're recording for the e3 segment

1377
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:07,199
It's a good call the closer we are the better cohesion we have

1378
02:04:10,539 --> 02:04:15,500
That's right. And that's how you recover your toughness. Yeah, we've recovered our energy that way watch out over this way on the left

1379
02:04:16,829 --> 02:04:19,069
Group up gunner down

Did you know you can nice shot? You were always the best shooter in crouch. You were always the best shooter of the group

1381
02:04:24,189 --> 02:04:32,180
Are we talking to you? You can do a tactical crouch if you run and crouch and

1382
02:04:32,659 --> 02:04:35,859

Across the map this side

1426
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:01,260
Oh

1427
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:03,260
They never did figure out to let the dogs out did they?

1428
02:08:03,979 --> 02:08:06,539
No, it's a real shame

1429
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:10,319
Ah, all right. I gotta take care of these guys. I'm going in

1430
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:19,220
Where are they?

1431
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:21,300

1432
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:27,899

Don't you have something to invent? It's pronounced copernicus

1439
02:08:56,270 --> 02:09:00,590
Did copernicus invent something or was he just like a physics guy? Like what did he do copernicus?

1440
02:09:00,590 --> 02:09:04,750
Did he discover the apple? I think he was the one that was like, hey guys, we're in a solar system

02:11:29,409 --> 02:11:31,489
Thanks, man

I might pick up the organ. Do you see how fucking cool this looks?

1472
02:11:39,090 --> 02:11:42,770
Is this molten like steel? Oh, this is gonna get hairy though

1473
02:11:43,489 --> 02:11:51,869

02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:06,319
Wait, it might heal you

1477
02:12:06,319 --> 02:12:09,520
I almost did for the bit then I realized I had a scripture. I'm not doing that

1478
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:15,840
Thank you

1479
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:17,840
There's a lot of people right now

1480
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:27,170
I need a sword for better crowd control. I want like a big axe

1481
02:12:28,510 --> 02:12:36,430
The axe is really good for like, um bosses and like powerful targets, but there are weapons that are more designed for like crowds

1482
02:12:37,229 --> 02:12:38,670
Yeah

1483
02:12:38,670 --> 02:12:40,670
nice

1484
02:12:41,550 --> 02:12:44,109
Nice, how many books what's our book status?

1485
02:12:45,949 --> 02:12:49,470
Does it show how many kills you had because I definitely was number one and I want to prove it and see it

1486
02:12:50,590 --> 02:12:52,590
I don't think they've added that yet, but apparently it's on the way

1487
02:12:53,229 --> 02:12:55,229
Oh dang. Yeah, I was probably up there

1488
02:12:56,189 --> 02:13:02,109
Too bad we can't find out i'm just kidding forgetting. I used my ability one time that entire match

1489
02:13:02,989 --> 02:13:04,029
Really?

1490
02:13:04,029 --> 02:13:05,710
Yeah, I need to I

1491
02:13:05,710 --> 02:13:07,390
I just keep forgetting

1492
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:14,560
Oh, it does show kills now. It does total for everyone. I think yeah. Oh cool. We had exactly 100 a thousand exactly 1000

1493
02:13:15,039 --> 02:13:18,560
Oh, wait. No, it was a thousand. I missed a zero. That's pretty rare

1494
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:22,960
It's got to be rare

1495
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,960
That's got to be rare. That's a good omen

1496
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:27,699
Oh my god, I have a grenade

1497
02:13:27,699 --> 02:13:29,260
gauntlet

1498
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:31,260
Oh, yeah, those are fun

1499
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:35,090
That sounds fun

1500
02:13:35,090 --> 02:13:38,689
Ah, sweet. Just got some fresh loot my drops aren't loading. Um

1501
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:42,850
Uh, maybe refresh maybe you have to reconnect your uh account or something

1502
02:13:43,569 --> 02:13:47,970
This should be on can we confirm that the drops actually have been on and working they're working. Okay

1503
02:13:48,850 --> 02:13:56,659
Yeah, mine was only working on mine. Cool. I really I would like to get your drops as well. I got two drops

1504
02:13:57,630 --> 02:14:09,229
Cool. Oh, I have a cutscene. We're back. Ooh, I don't have a cutscene

1505
02:14:09,229 --> 02:14:13,069
But i'll be right back in one minute

1506
02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:15,390
Yeah, so this is um

1507
02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:20,109
This is fun. I like it

1508
02:14:20,350 --> 02:14:22,350
I have a cutscene, too

1509
02:14:29,699 --> 02:14:31,699
I already saw this one

1510
02:14:31,699 --> 02:14:35,619
Executed for less this unit will request permission to do so

1511
02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:42,930
The recruit is expected to achieve competence in regard to technical apparatus

1512
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:46,270
I'm curious about this

1513
02:14:50,029 --> 02:14:54,029
In order to perform their duties at the maximum level of efficiency

1514
02:14:54,510 --> 02:15:00,659
Because I think i'm level four, right?

1515
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:03,460
Will most likely cause the recruit to die

1516
02:15:04,909 --> 02:15:06,350
Do check your pizza

1517
02:15:06,350 --> 02:15:15,659
It's all right

1518
02:15:15,659 --> 02:15:18,539
All right. You've started to make a name for yourself reach trust level eight

1519
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:21,710
You've unlocked the shrine of okay, so there's the shrine

1520
02:15:22,510 --> 02:15:24,750
Actually, let me come back and say

1521
02:15:25,979 --> 02:15:30,460
20 of 163 on the oh god. That's a that's a very small amount. So idea

1522
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:33,420
I just unlocked the ability to upgrade or do whatever this is

1523
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:36,720
the shrine

1524
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:41,680
Oh, I have this too, I don't maybe I don't want any of these i'm just gonna

1525
02:15:43,149 --> 02:15:47,069
You know, i'll just wait. I'll earn more money and i'll buy a different weapon when they refresh

1526
02:15:48,430 --> 02:15:50,430
Oh, because wait, what's consequent?

1527
02:15:51,170 --> 02:15:53,569
So it basically with this thing. It's like once you find a weapon you like

1528
02:15:54,210 --> 02:15:56,609
Uh, you can theoretically just keep upgrading it

1529
02:15:57,409 --> 02:15:59,729
Oh and it uses this, uh this currency

1530
02:16:01,409 --> 02:16:06,239
Where's that person? It's over. It's kind of right out the

1531
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:08,159
See if we can find you

1532
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:11,359
It's literally if you go to the big, um green room

1533
02:16:12,319 --> 02:16:17,199
And just if it is a hallway you just turn. Um, it's like it's literally like two feet away

1534
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:21,520
Oh here. Okay. I see. It's like a robot this five or six slots. Yep

1535
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:30,609
I don't think I want to do anything

1536
02:16:30,609 --> 02:16:34,770
Yeah, i'm worried to lock into something and start upgrading if I find something better. Yeah

1537
02:16:35,809 --> 02:16:40,370
You unfortunately kind of just have to level a bunch to get more options before you start spending the resources. So

1538
02:16:41,090 --> 02:16:45,489
I imagine you probably just get resources and it's not too terrible, right?

1539
02:16:46,129 --> 02:16:52,290
Yeah, they probably only added resources like a few days ago. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah, that's still like that whole grind is new

1540
02:16:52,610 --> 02:16:53,969
What is this?

1541
02:16:53,969 --> 02:16:56,049
New perk i'll get i'll upgrade this

1542
02:16:56,930 --> 02:16:59,270
But if you guys want to learn how to get new cosmetics

1543
02:16:59,969 --> 02:17:02,719
I can explain that real quick

1544
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:06,399
How do you inching ever so close to buying that grenade?

1545
02:17:06,479 --> 02:17:12,940
How may I serve plus five percent you want to buy the pants you can also earn them by doing achievements, um

1546
02:17:13,739 --> 02:17:19,020
And every class has their own achievements. So if you go to penances, yeah penances press escape go to penances

1547
02:17:19,659 --> 02:17:22,299
Uh class and then pick your class

1548
02:17:22,940 --> 02:17:27,739
And it'll give like a little description. So for me, it was like while dashing kill a mutant with a melee attack

1549
02:17:27,819 --> 02:17:29,819
And I got a shirt for that

1550
02:17:30,510 --> 02:17:32,909
Oh, I just unlocked a weapon, but I don't see it here

1551
02:17:33,870 --> 02:17:38,430
Kill three enemies with a frag grenade without it bouncing interesting and you unlock shirt for that

1552
02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:41,360
Yeah

1553
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:42,930
I see

1554
02:17:42,930 --> 02:17:47,969
During a single use of volley fire hit the weak spot of four enemies with a weapon secondary action without missing a shot

1555
02:17:49,729 --> 02:17:52,930
Damn, oh some of these are gonna take me a while. Wait

1556
02:17:56,129 --> 02:17:58,129
It's I unlocked a weapon but

1557
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:00,930
I don't have it and it's not at the store

1558
02:18:01,409 --> 02:18:03,409
So you unlocked a weapon class?

1559
02:18:04,049 --> 02:18:06,690
Oh, it's just meaning you can now buy it

1560
02:18:07,329 --> 02:18:11,969
But it won't be in the store all the time. I think because the weapons refresh. Oh, okay

1561
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:16,690
But I think germa at level four or five. I think four you get a free weapon

1562
02:18:17,780 --> 02:18:23,540
Also, the shop refreshes in one minute. So if it's not in there now, it might be in one minute

1563
02:18:24,180 --> 02:18:26,020
Your pizza is ready

1564
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:32,049
I'll go get it. Oh, hold on. I don't know if this pizza is real. Yeah, I just yeah

1565
02:18:32,930 --> 02:18:37,600
Yeah, I don't know either. Let me see it real quick

1566
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:40,620
It's gonna eat the little bits real quick

1567
02:18:42,559 --> 02:18:45,229
Oh god

1568
02:18:45,229 --> 02:18:48,670
He did it. Oh hot fuck. He did it off camera

1569
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:56,129
German scared of his own oven, huh? How was the za?

1570
02:18:57,340 --> 02:19:01,180
Um, it's frozen on the bottom and the top was burning hot that I've managed

1571
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:07,389
I don't know. I have this little oven over here. It's only heats from the top and I don't know

1572
02:19:07,389 --> 02:19:14,020
I just put it in there. It's like an easy big oven. Vinny if you get the right components you can build

1573
02:19:14,659 --> 02:19:15,680
the

1574
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:17,760
chevalma

1575
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:19,760
Why do I think that's something like ligma?

1576
02:19:21,819 --> 02:19:27,040
Like are you tricking me into saying something chat member? Okay, so the weapon should probably be refreshed, right?

1577
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:30,159
Oh 25 seconds

1578
02:19:30,159 --> 02:19:32,000
Make your final purchases

1579
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,909
Ding ding ding if you see a rare in there, should you just get it or no there's gonna

1580
02:19:37,709 --> 02:19:44,370
It eventually becomes much higher chance for rares and purples and stuff. So so there are they like legendaries? Yeah, there's legendaries

1581
02:19:45,329 --> 02:19:48,850
Now you just haven't yet. You just started speaking my language here. Oh, yeah

1582
02:19:49,649 --> 02:19:52,370
Where are the new weapons gonna be? Oh what I see I see

1583
02:19:54,239 --> 02:19:56,239
one second

1584
02:19:56,399 --> 02:19:58,399
zero seconds

1585
02:19:58,399 --> 02:20:01,600
Oh new weapons different. Okay. Ooh

1586
02:20:02,479 --> 02:20:10,680
What does it mean that if it's on the black market? I don't know which one

1587
02:20:11,829 --> 02:20:15,190
ranged weak spot or ranged probably this one although the

1588
02:20:15,909 --> 02:20:17,440
ammo is

1589
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:22,309
Terrible for this one. What do you guys think?

1590
02:20:26,659 --> 02:20:29,940
What I think wait, are these gonna be different for all of us? Yeah

1591
02:20:31,110 --> 02:20:32,309
Hey

1592
02:20:32,309 --> 02:20:36,209
chat

1593
02:20:38,159 --> 02:20:42,559
Autoguns are a trap really besides the brace braced autogun. Oh, okay

1594
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:47,239
So maybe wait a little longer

1595
02:20:49,940 --> 02:20:51,459
I'm gonna save my money

1596
02:20:51,459 --> 02:20:54,579
Should I get a new flamer?

1597
02:20:54,579 --> 02:21:08,579
Or hammer? Oh shit. Oh wait, it's like a punch gauntlet like an explosive gauntlet or something. Very cool

1598
02:21:08,979 --> 02:21:15,159
How you guys doing you uh, you still around for another one video are you gonna take off? No, I I'm I gotta take off

We can also uh, we might have I think I criken are these staffs cool?

1607
02:21:56,469 --> 02:21:59,510
Uh, yeah, they're like four staff. It sounds badass

1608
02:21:59,989 --> 02:22:05,909
I think they're like you can channel like a lightning or fire. I haven't tried it myself yet, but they look fun

1609
02:22:06,149 --> 02:22:10,639
Uh, how do I invite somebody? Can I just do it just from what you have to be later? Yeah

1610
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:15,079
Anyone can invite within the group. Okay, cool, because I think

1611
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:21,120
Uh, I think I got a yeah, I got I got one of my mods. The vr. Josh is done

1612
02:22:26,950 --> 02:22:36,100
So just go I can just invite him from here. Okay, so

1613
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:39,920
um

1614
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:51,590
Invite I think I just did it. All right, it'd be here in a second. Let me um, actually drag him into this call

1615
02:23:02,559 --> 02:23:11,159
There we go. Where did you save the little place to test the weapon is?

1616
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:15,440
Yo, uh the meat grinder. What's up? What's up? Hello. Hello

1617
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:22,959
Yeah, this is uh vr. Josh. Hello vr. Josh. Hello. I think i've met cracking before yeah in vr. Yeah

1618
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:29,750
Yeah, I know vr. Josh. Did you get the invite? Josh? Yeah, I just uh got to get the game

1619
02:23:30,389 --> 02:23:34,790
Sweet i've already done the tutorial and everything. So oh so you're you're a seasoned player. I think then right?

1620
02:23:34,950 --> 02:23:39,110
Well, I mean I got the first tutorial round and then the first match they throw you into but yeah

1621
02:23:39,829 --> 02:23:43,659
Okay, cool. This is you i'm assuming right this uh virtuous

1622
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:50,520
Yeah, okay. All right. So what mission should we do?

1623
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:53,010
Well

1624
02:23:53,010 --> 02:23:57,649
I'd say once you guys get level five then we could start a or a tier three mission

1625
02:23:57,969 --> 02:24:02,469
It will be difficult at five, but if it's doable people are saying that

1626
02:24:03,329 --> 02:24:05,989
Mod busy we can do whatever we want

1627
02:24:07,250 --> 02:24:12,129
Uh, this is not just that's not how it works. There's not just one mod here

1628
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:30,770
I can't find this training arena. Is there a refresher? Is it? Oh, okay. Prepare repair

1629
02:24:32,709 --> 02:24:36,229
Assassination was kind of cool. Yeah

1630
02:24:36,389 --> 02:24:45,799
Uh, we got depends if you want one with lights on or lights off. Um, I think lights on I don't think we're uh,

1631
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:48,600
skilled enough as new players to handle the

1632
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:53,120
Yeah, it also sucks because you can't use the like you can't use other weapons

1633
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:57,280
Like just having to use the one gun with the flashlight. Yeah, I will say though

1634
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:04,309
That is actually really cool mechanic to put in the game because they can just keep doing weird shit like that

1635
02:25:04,629 --> 02:25:10,079
Like oh today, um, uh grenades just uh fall from the sky every five seconds

1636
02:25:10,479 --> 02:25:16,850
Like they can do cool wacky shit like that. I think that's pretty cool because you said those missions are playable just normally, right?

1637
02:25:18,260 --> 02:25:19,059
Uh, yeah

1638
02:25:19,059 --> 02:25:27,159
No, I think there's definitely the potential for like a whole bunch of modifiers later on that's cool. Oh

1639
02:25:27,719 --> 02:25:32,129
Wait, oh wait, I didn't do I put my weapon on no you're in here. Oh, they're on here

1640
02:25:32,370 --> 02:25:36,469
Oh, yeah looks like it you can also put your weapon on if you press i and then you can equip it

1641
02:25:36,469 --> 02:25:39,540
Oh my god. I look so cool

1642
02:25:39,620 --> 02:25:41,620
If you don't look any different

1643
02:25:42,870 --> 02:25:47,909
What wait, where's my sword or my oh my god wait till we get in there guys you I if you didn't have a crush on

1644
02:25:47,909 --> 02:25:54,680
Me before you might just have one boy. I as soon as we get in there. I look so cool

1645
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:57,399
And it's just like you have the same shirt and pants on you just have like a

1646
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:05,360
A different weapon here. You'll see when we get in game. You'll see rest assured god

1647
02:26:05,360 --> 02:26:12,450
I can't wait to get some better clothing options though. I look kind of dweebish. Yeah cracking it. Did you buy that costume?

1648
02:26:13,139 --> 02:26:18,680
No, I did the achievements for it, which is like just doing special, you know challenges in the level

1649
02:26:24,020 --> 02:26:26,020
Are you learning to count

1650
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:30,180
Learning to count by his fingers the servitors just like insulting the ogre

1651
02:26:31,379 --> 02:26:32,340
Yeah

1652
02:26:32,340 --> 02:26:36,340
So apparently in lore the smartest ogren can count to four

1653
02:26:36,899 --> 02:26:38,100
That's

1654
02:26:38,100 --> 02:26:41,940
That's really that's literally the smartest ogren out there can get to four

1655
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:45,459
I understand what that fifth finger is. Yeah, he's working. He's working

1656
02:26:47,459 --> 02:26:48,899
Wow

1657
02:26:48,899 --> 02:26:51,940
Oh, he can only count to four on his fingers. Yeah. He just like your mouth

1658
02:26:55,239 --> 02:26:57,239
Oh my goodness guys. This is

1659
02:26:57,969 --> 02:27:03,430
Whoa, i'm like a wizard now look up at the skybox in this one. All right, that's pretty cool

1660
02:27:04,229 --> 02:27:07,270
This is the best weapon in the game. Yeah, unfortunately guys

1661
02:27:08,149 --> 02:27:10,389
Unfortunately, you guys aren't me. All right

1662
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:15,350
Let me see, what do you got? Yeah, there's a there's a a space marine statue down that way

1663
02:27:15,989 --> 02:27:17,510
I'll go take a look

1664
02:27:17,510 --> 02:27:22,549
All right. Sorry chat the smartest ogren can write his name and count to 10. I was off by six

1665
02:27:23,270 --> 02:27:26,819
Look up

1666
02:27:26,819 --> 02:27:28,819
We're inside of a motherboard

1667
02:27:29,959 --> 02:27:31,239
I've said yeah

1668
02:27:31,239 --> 02:27:33,159
Yeah, so this is what the rat in my pc

1669
02:27:33,239 --> 02:27:38,600
They basically build cities on top of cities in this universe because there's just too many people and over time it expands too much

1670
02:27:39,079 --> 02:27:41,399
So that's just like another city up there

1671
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:46,040
It's upside down or something. It is it feels like it's upside down. Yeah

1672
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:48,680
Mirrored or something. That's weird

1673
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:52,200
I would hate to live here, dude. I would get so bullied

1674
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,440
This would be tough. I would get so bullied

1675
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:04,870
I mean you you fucking go into school with your like staff and pajamas

1676
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:11,079
I got my stupid little onesie on my my yellow onesie

1677
02:28:11,239 --> 02:28:14,920
Me

1678
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:18,520
Yeah, I would yeah, they would instantly turn me into one of those servitor toilets

1679
02:28:19,399 --> 02:28:25,590
This thing is so cool. All right, and also it's also it's a melee weapon

1680
02:28:28,770 --> 02:28:32,049
What you're oh the oh, that's cool. You can just club them with it. Yeah

1681
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,920
What I think that's so cool. You like the reason it's hand mounted is so that you don't misplace it

1682
02:28:38,319 --> 02:28:42,000
I remember hearing the lore. Oh, so it's like attached to me. So I don't yeah

1683
02:28:42,559 --> 02:28:44,559
You don't accidentally drop it someplace

1684
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:48,790
I think i'm gonna be uh, i'm gonna upgrade andy on this one. I think

1685
02:28:49,590 --> 02:28:51,540
Yeah

1686
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:53,780
Oh, it's got a forward punch as well. What's the charge?

1687
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:58,420
It feels so good when you find a weapon that you like mesh well with, you know, yeah, that's how I feel about this staff

1688
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:04,579
The game is changed. There's other staffs too. So like if you start using this one and then you try other ones later

1689
02:29:11,809 --> 02:29:13,809
Oh

1690
02:29:14,370 --> 02:29:16,530
Geez the call out of barrel

1691
02:29:17,170 --> 02:29:28,260
All the uh, the magic looks awesome from the staff cool

1692
02:29:28,260 --> 02:29:33,540
But I really feel like i'm doing nothing for the team here. I think it like leaves a burning area on the ground

1693
02:29:38,159 --> 02:29:40,159
That yeah, yeah

1694
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:44,260
Yeah, that just happened. I

1695
02:29:45,219 --> 02:29:48,979
I didn't quite finish that part, but I did kind of say that you're right

1696
02:29:51,219 --> 02:29:53,520
Yeah, that

1697
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:55,280
Just happened

1698
02:29:55,280 --> 02:30:04,280
God damn it. I think it's cool though. Just get a bunch of those and then just rotate the pool. You hear that. What's that?

1699
02:30:05,479 --> 02:30:09,719
Is one of the uh, the slime slug people. Oh, yeah, holy

1700
02:30:13,299 --> 02:30:16,260
Uh, we got a big one guys we got a you're gonna want to see this

1701
02:30:17,219 --> 02:30:22,530
He's slug now. He's coming for me

1702
02:30:25,940 --> 02:30:27,940
Why is he coming for me? Get him away from me

1703
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:32,760
Leave me alone

1704
02:30:40,739 --> 02:30:48,479
You see that charlotte I didn't see it but I heard you scream, okay, where am I? No, he's

1705
02:30:50,879 --> 02:30:52,879

1706
02:30:56,709 --> 02:31:00,309
We are hurt oh god what I wouldn't give to inhale some of this

02:31:16,170 --> 02:31:18,170
That's so great

1711
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:24,170

02:31:45,860 --> 02:31:51,379
He's still uh, okay. I don't know how I don't know how he's doing, but he did not seem to be liking it

1717
02:31:51,379 --> 02:31:53,379
Too much. I didn't like it. Okay

1718
02:31:58,709 --> 02:32:01,270
You're gonna blow some fat clouds, man

1780
02:36:26,950 --> 02:36:31,670
Guys i'm getting hurt real bad. Should we have let the person that can't count to four do this

1781
02:36:33,110 --> 02:36:36,790
Technically augerins are the slowest at doing it than ever anyone. Oh, are you really?

1782
02:36:38,469 --> 02:36:45,540
It's not there's literally one guy here. What happened? Yeah. Yeah. Well, there were plenty more but I managed to take them out

1783
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:51,930

02:36:52,889 --> 02:37:01,000
What is this get out of here? All right, i'm gonna i'll do it somebody protect me protecting

02:37:03,620 --> 02:37:06,440
There's no one even here anymore

1786
02:37:06,440 --> 02:37:09,959
They got tired of us. I promise i'm not doing this wrong. It is really slow

1787
02:37:11,399 --> 02:37:16,010
Dude, I love this stuff

1788
02:37:16,090 --> 02:37:20,700
You may have any ammo when you were

1789
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:27,079
Thank you guys think you can learn magic when you were younger

1790
02:37:27,079 --> 02:37:31,079
I would really practice telekinetic stuff

1791
02:37:32,040 --> 02:37:36,840
Do you tell me like real magic you wanted to move stuff? Yeah when I was little I really wanted to be magic

1792
02:37:37,159 --> 02:37:38,440
You ever get close?

1793
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:40,739
I've been that same world

1794
02:37:40,739 --> 02:37:45,139
You did what in that same world when I was younger? I wanted to be a magic wand maker

1795
02:37:45,940 --> 02:37:48,180
Only like the all-even-under guy

1796
02:37:48,579 --> 02:37:52,819
But this is this is way before that though before he existed. You're like you invented the concept

1797
02:37:53,059 --> 02:37:59,139
Well, by the way, this is not like harry potter style magic this is I think magicians on stage magic

1798
02:38:00,389 --> 02:38:02,629
You know what I mean? It's probably a pretty big market for that

1799
02:38:04,229 --> 02:38:06,629
What is involved with making the wand like I don't know

1800
02:38:07,989 --> 02:38:13,510
I wish I could ask my former self little handkerchiefs out of it. There's got to be a secret compartment or two

1801
02:38:15,270 --> 02:38:17,590
Yeah, I need to brush up on like magic

1802
02:38:18,469 --> 02:38:23,110
Just like you wanted to be a magician you wanted to provide a service to magicians

1803
02:38:23,510 --> 02:38:28,229
Despite not knowing how the magic works itself. Yeah, I didn't know the first step of making it

1804
02:38:29,190 --> 02:38:31,190
Not to provide it not at all

1805
02:38:31,590 --> 02:38:36,709
Oh, yeah, I I just figured I wanted to be a magic wand maker not a magician

1806
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:41,750
That's how you make the money in the magic world, right? So that's good business sense smart kid

1807
02:38:46,659 --> 02:38:50,340
Like the uh, the people who made it rich in the gold rush for the ones selling the mining supplies

1808
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:53,620
Yeah

1809
02:38:54,889 --> 02:38:56,889
Very low, please

1810
02:39:03,139 --> 02:39:07,690
nice

1811
02:39:07,690 --> 02:39:13,129
Oh also looking for grim wars. I totally forgot to even mention that they're like little flowy books

1812
02:39:14,170 --> 02:39:18,969
Oh, that's where like extra. Yeah, that's for extra experience at the end probably already missed one, but

1813
02:39:20,010 --> 02:39:21,290
It's okay

1814
02:39:21,290 --> 02:39:23,930
No, I feel like we'll get all three this time. We're capable

1815
02:39:24,649 --> 02:39:26,569
All three out of two

1816
02:39:26,569 --> 02:39:28,870
All three out of two

1817
02:39:31,940 --> 02:39:34,500
Let's get some uh, I want more um

1818
02:39:34,979 --> 02:39:37,930
I want my ammo on this thing. I'm definitely going to upgrade it

1819
02:39:42,069 --> 02:39:44,229
It's addicting oh, here's that ammo right here

1820
02:39:48,709 --> 02:39:55,670
Just don't go shooting navigators or sanctioned psychers you get in trouble for that shut up

1821
02:39:57,899 --> 02:40:04,379
Geez, okay

1822
02:40:04,379 --> 02:40:06,809
Look at this. So a little

1823
02:40:07,610 --> 02:40:09,610
Uh

1824
02:40:22,729 --> 02:40:26,010
Like an embroidered pillow, yeah throw pillow

1825
02:40:29,770 --> 02:40:31,770
That would not be a bad existence

1826
02:40:32,170 --> 02:40:34,409
Unless it's painful

1827
02:40:34,489 --> 02:40:38,969
I'm sure it's very painful, you know, yeah, probably having your nerves bound to like metal would

1828
02:40:39,450 --> 02:40:42,409
Probably suck. I think like the process like most

1829
02:40:43,290 --> 02:40:47,290
Lose consciousness and like aren't sentient anymore, but some retain it somehow

1830
02:40:48,010 --> 02:40:50,010
and they're just like

1831
02:40:50,569 --> 02:40:54,409
Like I would be just I would still feel it probably yeah with your luck. Yeah

1832
02:40:57,260 --> 02:40:59,209
Hey

1833
02:40:59,209 --> 02:41:02,100
Where are you?

1834
02:41:02,100 --> 02:41:05,750
Who this guy shooting across the balcony over there?

1835
02:41:10,709 --> 02:41:13,350
Ammo here. Yeah, I think I got enough

1836
02:41:14,250 --> 02:41:19,209
I can't use ammo anymore. I'm now a spiritual being I cast I cast magic

1837
02:41:20,629 --> 02:41:22,629
That just seems like kind of a fun character

1838
02:41:23,639 --> 02:41:25,639
That seems like a fun character actually

1839
02:41:25,719 --> 02:41:29,180
It is it's pretty cool. I love this little spell

1840
02:41:34,090 --> 02:41:38,969
Oh, uh, is this healed? No, never mind just computer this way

1841
02:41:39,690 --> 02:41:44,420
I don't know we're down where they're at. Oh

1842
02:41:47,139 --> 02:41:51,459
Are we going the right way or you guys are going the right way? Uh, it's down here where snot knees

1843
02:41:52,420 --> 02:41:57,940
Uh, why am I the only one that gets snagged by this little bug zapper net? Oh, there's fire. Goodbye

1844
02:42:01,049 --> 02:42:03,799
This is the worst oh

1845
02:42:07,559 --> 02:42:13,579
I'm fine. I'll be fine. Wait, how did I get back up? I think you can help you can uh press e

1846
02:42:14,620 --> 02:42:15,739
grenade

1847
02:42:15,739 --> 02:42:25,129
But there's something green back here. Was that a tome? I think I got one of the

1848
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:28,250
Oh you did nice

1849
02:42:28,649 --> 02:42:30,649
So if you die with it it goes

1850
02:42:32,329 --> 02:42:34,329
But there's healing over here

1851
02:42:35,049 --> 02:42:40,809
Or snot down. Oh down there. Yeah, what's that thing on the map? It's like a icon. What's that? Oh, yeah snot

1852
02:42:40,809 --> 02:42:42,090
You should get this too

1853
02:42:42,090 --> 02:42:43,850
Uh, what I can

1854
02:42:43,850 --> 02:42:45,850
Oh, it's the heal icon. Okay

1855
02:42:45,930 --> 02:42:54,889
Like I didn't even know he died

1856
02:43:00,149 --> 02:43:10,569
Everything you've told me so far makes me want to learn about the lore of warhammer

1857
02:43:11,530 --> 02:43:14,010
Yeah, right it's it's addicting once you like learn a little bit

1858
02:43:14,969 --> 02:43:17,770
uh, my two favorite concepts in warhammer are

1859
02:43:18,729 --> 02:43:19,930
like

1860
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:22,969
Hive cities, which is where we are and then uh,

1861
02:43:23,610 --> 02:43:29,290
Just like how distance works and like time is really actually original and you can hit by the train

1862
02:43:29,690 --> 02:43:31,690
so like go through the warp and like

1863
02:43:31,850 --> 02:43:33,850
Come out years later. Sometimes like

1864
02:43:34,489 --> 02:43:36,649
Yeah, it's like inconsistent. Yeah

1865
02:43:37,610 --> 02:43:41,290
I don't want to waste em. I'm definitely falling down the uh, it's a servitor radio

1866
02:43:42,170 --> 02:43:44,170
Wait, let me talk to him

1867
02:43:44,489 --> 02:43:48,819
Nothing in there

1868
02:43:50,420 --> 02:43:53,780
Dude what a funny idea just like punishing people by turning them into shit

1869
02:43:54,920 --> 02:43:56,920
That is so funny. I want to be a little dude

1870
02:43:57,719 --> 02:44:04,120
I need to make an entire game about being a servitor

1871
02:44:05,399 --> 02:44:07,399
And you just stand around

1872
02:44:07,479 --> 02:44:09,299
Yeah

1873
02:44:09,299 --> 02:44:11,299
You just watch people go and have fun

1874
02:44:11,379 --> 02:44:15,479
I have no i'm not I can't hit anybody. Come on, man

1875
02:44:25,100 --> 02:44:27,100
It would be like prop hunt

1876
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:30,100
But like you don't move

1877
02:44:30,100 --> 02:44:34,180
You're so so bad. No, you you wouldn't have said anything unless I said that first

1878
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:39,850
I saw that

1879
02:44:39,850 --> 02:44:41,850
That person was running behind you

1880
02:44:44,700 --> 02:44:46,700
If i'm rushing ahead too much just let me know

1881
02:44:47,180 --> 02:44:57,479
Just like playing a speedy nice guy. No. No, you're good. Oh boy

1882
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:02,659
Oh that hurts

1883
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:10,680
There's ammo back here if you want

1884
02:45:12,440 --> 02:45:15,770
Watch that

1885
02:45:24,940 --> 02:45:30,940
I kind of I want to place the flavor guy eventually. Yeah, seems fun. He plays like the augering kind of like he charges in

1886
02:45:31,899 --> 02:45:34,969
deals with words really well

1887
02:45:37,180 --> 02:45:39,180
What am I doing?

1888
02:45:39,260 --> 02:45:41,260
Oh my god, I almost blew myself up. That's a lot of people

1889
02:45:43,479 --> 02:45:45,979
Holy shit, just shove them off

1890
02:45:45,979 --> 02:45:49,819
Oh, yeah, I can get there's a challenge for my character to shove a bunch of people off

1891
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:55,260
Yeah, i'm gonna try that. I completely forgot about the challenge. Is it that's how you unlock pants and stuff?

1892
02:45:55,659 --> 02:45:59,500
Yeah, i'm gonna get a nice little pair of like a lincey aga belt

1893
02:46:01,100 --> 02:46:03,100
This music listen to this

1894
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:24,899
I need that that's not very much ammo though. What the heck what the heck

1895
02:46:25,620 --> 02:46:27,620
success is

1896
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:34,020
Warm

1897
02:46:35,020 --> 02:46:37,899
Yeah, I feel like that i'm like so worried i'm missing it

1898
02:46:38,620 --> 02:46:40,620
Yeah, the one I saw

1899
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:44,379
It was glowing green like it was behind the boxes the other one

1900
02:46:44,459 --> 02:46:48,620
So as soon as we get out of here, we should gather around a little campfire and read the grim war

1901
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:50,780
Oh, there's a lot of dorks over here help

1902
02:46:52,219 --> 02:46:56,940
A lot of dorks. Yeah, I bet you were a bully in high school. I think you're a high school bully

1903
02:46:57,659 --> 02:47:02,969
The guy the guy the guy that wanted to make magicians ones, yeah

1904
02:47:04,889 --> 02:47:10,010
Yeah, oh yeah, that's such I was such a young I was such a bully, you know the guy that wanted to make the match

1905
02:47:10,729 --> 02:47:12,729
What the fuck just happened?

1906
02:47:15,129 --> 02:47:20,420
We're all pretty freaked up, huh? Yeah, we need some healing does anyone have a box a cavernicus you do

1907
02:47:20,739 --> 02:47:23,139
I do but we might want to find an actual heal station

1908
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:30,040
I gather around everyone box. Oh, that's helpful

1909
02:47:38,379 --> 02:47:46,149
Nice does that box not heal if you've got purple? Yeah, only these stations heal the purple. Oh lark

1910
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
I'm taking all the ammo. I feel bad

1911
02:47:56,409 --> 02:48:02,149
I like using this one because I don't need ammo. I just i'm just channeling like energy

1912
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:09,479
Careful, sorry. Sorry cavernicus. What am I actually doing?

1913
02:48:10,600 --> 02:48:12,600
Oh, I was running it

1914
02:48:13,639 --> 02:48:18,600
I thought you were getting mad because I was butchering the lord call it the right thing snot

1915
02:48:19,959 --> 02:48:21,959
It's called garbly chokes

1916
02:48:23,239 --> 02:48:25,239
My garbly chokes levels are low

1917
02:48:27,239 --> 02:48:32,899
Eat shit, you know what fucking i'm going in

1918
02:48:33,540 --> 02:48:36,229
I'll try and

1919
02:48:49,899 --> 02:48:57,180
Ammo never mind, there's no ammo here. I didn't find any your character said ammo time

1920
02:48:58,440 --> 02:49:01,719
Ammo time am I insane? I straight up think he said ammo time

1921
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:04,840
I must have been a fucking glitch with your computer dude

1922
02:49:06,040 --> 02:49:08,409
That's weird

1923
02:49:08,729 --> 02:49:14,260
Does the does the bloom get more intense if you're very low on health?

1924
02:49:14,819 --> 02:49:16,629
I don't know

1925
02:49:16,629 --> 02:49:19,590
It's like my guy's like under a bar. It's uh

1926
02:49:20,229 --> 02:49:22,229
A little fuzzy around the edges now

1927
02:49:22,549 --> 02:49:25,370
Yeah, I feel like I just smoked a pepper

1928
02:49:25,930 --> 02:49:30,969
It's a big chest over here

1929
02:49:32,090 --> 02:49:34,090
All right, we can all heal here now

1930
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:42,520
Guys they're trying to break in it's not heel is that them actually trying to break in

1931
02:49:43,159 --> 02:49:47,879
I don't know. Maybe they're like striking a table or just looking over here. They're doing something out here

1932
02:49:47,959 --> 02:49:51,079
It's a lot of really cool environmental. Yeah, this is the drum class

1933
02:49:51,079 --> 02:49:53,079
Yes

1934
02:49:53,319 --> 02:49:55,319
They're down there playing bongos

1935
02:49:55,319 --> 02:49:58,840
There's a lot going on if that's that's what I mean earlier when I said this just stopped going on

1936
02:49:59,559 --> 02:50:01,559
Let's see. Yeah, see no one was there

1937
02:50:02,409 --> 02:50:04,409
Oh, i'm gonna use this

1938
02:50:08,809 --> 02:50:14,139
All right, so for this one

1939
02:50:14,139 --> 02:50:16,540
We want to go to each of these trains right left and right?

1940
02:50:16,780 --> 02:50:20,459
Yeah, and then we open it and we transport the ammunition on it to the

1941
02:50:22,379 --> 02:50:24,379
Okay, this is gonna get it's gonna get weird

1942
02:50:31,219 --> 02:50:38,219
I think they're dead

1943
02:50:38,219 --> 02:50:41,420
What other kind of staffs and stuff are there coming from the other side? No

1944
02:50:42,139 --> 02:50:44,139
The face is so itchy

1945
02:50:48,739 --> 02:50:56,549
Get away from him

1946
02:50:56,549 --> 02:50:58,549
Uh-oh, I got netted. Oh, no

1947
02:50:58,549 --> 02:51:02,389
Good boy. They're taking us out one by one. They're netting us all I can't move

1948
02:51:03,270 --> 02:51:06,489
Oh, I see him. He's like trying to clear the space. Oh no

1949
02:51:07,209 --> 02:51:08,950
Thank you

1950
02:51:08,950 --> 02:51:10,629
Oh fire

1951
02:51:13,450 --> 02:51:18,010
All right, so oh we gotta open the rest of these up. Yeah, we open these up and then just throw them out again

1952
02:51:19,129 --> 02:51:22,569
What do I throw this brother? Uh, we're just gonna carry them in the

1953
02:51:24,809 --> 02:51:33,059
I'm gonna get this net guy. He's being a problem. Anybody have any ammo? Uh, no, I've got a book. Oh, here's something right up here

1954
02:51:38,459 --> 02:51:40,559
All right. I got this thingy damn copernicus

1955
02:51:41,500 --> 02:51:45,340
I just see you telling they're chasing some poor guy down. That was the netter dude

1956
02:51:45,819 --> 02:51:47,819
Oh, there's a couple more containers down here if we need them

1957
02:51:49,430 --> 02:51:50,629
Oh

1958
02:51:50,629 --> 02:51:56,180
Oh, I see what to take him down here. Oh stop

1959
02:51:57,450 --> 02:52:00,969
Yeah, so it's like up the platform like the landing platform. All right

1960
02:52:02,090 --> 02:52:04,969
So we're gonna get as many as we can over there, right? Whatever just

1961
02:52:05,930 --> 02:52:07,930
How can I?

1962
02:52:08,569 --> 02:52:10,569
I'm walking the stairs

1963
02:52:11,450 --> 02:52:14,920
How many do you need for that's all? Uh, it's just all of them

1964
02:52:15,959 --> 02:52:19,180
We have a couple here and then we have to get a get them to that

1965
02:52:19,979 --> 02:52:26,940
Yeah, so the augurans carry them faster than others so i'll pick it up is there be you want to drop it for me?

1966
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:30,620
I'll take it

1967
02:52:30,700 --> 02:52:32,700
Ow

1968
02:52:35,129 --> 02:52:40,649
I gotta find a pit to push some people off and this goes up in the middle. Yep. Yep right to that pod up there

1969
02:52:42,809 --> 02:52:46,010
Why do you keep swinging to dead bodies because they make sure they're dead

1970
02:52:46,889 --> 02:52:48,889
Ha ha

1971
02:52:49,370 --> 02:52:53,850
I mean when you knock them over as an augurian, that's when you knock them. Yeah, sometimes they don't know

1972
02:53:00,250 --> 02:53:09,260
The flamer

1973
02:53:09,879 --> 02:53:11,879
Oh, all right, it's not got you

1974
02:53:12,680 --> 02:53:14,680
My life flash before my eyes

1975
02:53:14,920 --> 02:53:16,280
jeez

1976
02:53:16,280 --> 02:53:20,420
What's this? Oh

1977
02:53:23,739 --> 02:53:43,270
That guy threw the grenade and then his head was gone another swarm coming behind us lots of I think this is ammunition

1978
02:53:44,889 --> 02:53:45,770
All right

1979
02:53:45,770 --> 02:53:48,729
Oh, wait, is this the stuff we're supposed to be delivering? Yeah, it's me to find

1980
02:53:49,530 --> 02:53:52,329
He's gonna throw a grenade in here. Absolutely. Oh shit

1981
02:53:53,610 --> 02:54:03,909
Get out of this run through it. Yep. Got him. You got one here

1982
02:54:08,010 --> 02:54:13,049
I'll take it angle it up and chuck it further. Yeah, it's fucking all right. I'm gonna go get this grenade guy

1983
02:54:15,450 --> 02:54:17,850
You don't want to see copernicus when he's mad they won't

1984
02:54:22,280 --> 02:54:24,280
Don't even there's like three of them that's why

1985
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:29,479
It's just I thought I could beat him over here another flamer

1986
02:54:30,969 --> 02:54:32,329
how

1987
02:54:32,329 --> 02:54:34,600
Put this out

1988
02:54:34,600 --> 02:54:37,879
Put this out. Are you blowing on it? Seriously? It was there for too long

1989
02:54:39,260 --> 02:54:41,260
Augur never learned to stop dropping the roll

1990
02:54:41,659 --> 02:54:45,219
Yeah

1991
02:54:45,219 --> 02:54:50,840
Oh you got that? Okay tunnel

1992
02:54:51,879 --> 02:54:53,879
I'm too weak. You got it. You have to do it

1993
02:54:55,500 --> 02:54:59,739
All right, i'll check it out there. Yeah, if you throw them over here, I can i'll grab it. Can I get it up?

1994
02:54:59,819 --> 02:55:01,899
Oh, wait, there we go. I think I got it. Yeah

1995
02:55:02,459 --> 02:55:07,610
I think that's the last one

1996
02:55:07,610 --> 02:55:09,610
Uh, we need one more

1997
02:55:09,930 --> 02:55:14,329
You're holding a big guy. Oh, I thought there was two slots. Okay, so we're good. We're good

1998
02:55:16,170 --> 02:55:18,969
So trouble if you shove people off this bridge, yeah

1999
02:55:20,090 --> 02:55:23,129
Oh, i'm gonna do that. Oh my god, this is gonna be so epic

2000
02:55:25,209 --> 02:55:27,209
Get to the helicopter

2001
02:55:30,250 --> 02:55:32,549
What's the lore name for it

2002
02:55:32,950 --> 02:55:36,469
Uh, that's a helicopter in the lung. Yeah, they just call it

2003
02:55:38,149 --> 02:55:43,979
Let's go. All right, i'm gonna bump them. Did I do it? That didn't work

2004
02:55:45,420 --> 02:55:47,420
All right, wait, we gotta be careful

2005
02:55:47,899 --> 02:55:49,899
Oh, they hurt they hit hard

2006
02:55:50,540 --> 02:55:54,459
Get in get in i've got to get on 20. I can't get on the platform

2007
02:55:56,409 --> 02:55:58,409
Can I jump the jump? Okay, there we go

2008
02:55:58,889 --> 02:56:00,889
No

2009
02:56:05,700 --> 02:56:11,459
Nice I got I probably got at least 60 or 70 there. I'm tired. You see me all tuckered out

2010
02:56:14,440 --> 02:56:16,440
Cool so we're gonna be level five

2011
02:56:16,819 --> 02:56:27,579
Yeah, you'll definitely hit the five

2012
02:56:27,579 --> 02:56:29,579
I just unlocked a dueling sword

2013
02:56:31,500 --> 02:56:33,500
Oh, wait, that one's super fun

2014
02:56:33,819 --> 02:56:37,659
It's like uh, you're basically holding it's like a you look a pirate. You have like a little cutlass

2015
02:56:38,219 --> 02:56:45,340
Oh really? Yeah, it looks so goofy. I unlocked um traits. That's like a skill points, right? Yeah, so those

2016
02:56:45,899 --> 02:56:51,899
Every five levels you can allocate you can change them whenever so you don't have to like respect or anything really and yeah, and they

2017
02:56:52,700 --> 02:56:55,819
Are like really good buffs for your class based on how you like to play them

2018
02:56:56,459 --> 02:57:03,399
Let's take a look

2019
02:57:03,399 --> 02:57:06,040
Do you guys want uh another fourth to jump in or?

2020
02:57:07,180 --> 02:57:14,379
Um, good either way, but yeah, i'm totally down for either. I I know uh stripping is available. Uh, germa if you want to see

2021
02:57:15,020 --> 02:57:18,860
Stripping's got a level 30 augren. It's really cool like the full

2022
02:57:19,659 --> 02:57:24,700
The full power of the eventual augren is oh my goodness. I just unlocked a new shirt

2023
02:57:25,620 --> 02:57:30,100
I kind of want to see that too. So i'll back out and let's trip enjoy and then we can see like what high level stuff

2024
02:57:30,100 --> 02:57:31,299
Looks like

2025
02:57:31,299 --> 02:57:35,459
Um, whatever. Yeah, I mean you want you want to do you want to just do one more and then we'll get stripping it

2026
02:57:35,860 --> 02:57:38,500
Oh, yeah, that's fine. If you want to do another one. Yeah, we'll do one more

2027
02:57:40,709 --> 02:57:43,110
You kind of want to see what like the high level unlocks look like

2028
02:57:44,260 --> 02:57:47,139
I only knocked five people off the ledge back there guys

2029
02:57:48,020 --> 02:57:50,340
Out of how many 70 I have to get 20

2030
02:57:51,459 --> 02:57:52,420
Okay

2031
02:57:52,420 --> 02:57:56,020
Well, what's this? I have to pick one of these two hit four. I don't know what that unlocks

2032
02:58:02,139 --> 02:58:05,930
Wait, I can change my can I change this?

2033
02:58:06,569 --> 02:58:12,899
Wait, there we go the feed if you just click on it, it'll equip the different one

2034
02:58:13,459 --> 02:58:15,459
Oh, I thought I could do something up here, too

2035
02:58:16,010 --> 02:58:19,610
Oh, no, those are that's just default. Those are default. I think for now

2036
02:58:19,610 --> 02:58:25,530
But eventually there's like gonna be other subclasses. I think so like i'm a zealot preacher and eventually you can be like a zealot

2037
02:58:25,850 --> 02:58:27,420
I don't know

2038
02:58:27,420 --> 02:58:41,459
Matic or something. So I gotta pick between these three. Yeah, I think i'm gonna keep my current staff

2039
02:58:41,540 --> 02:58:43,620
I feel like it's this one. I feel like it's the this one here

2040
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:48,360
Just 100 toughness replenishment

2041
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:56,280
That seems just great. What are the uh, there's little icons on weapons. I don't know what each one means

2042
02:58:58,100 --> 02:58:59,459
Yeah

2043
02:58:59,459 --> 02:59:03,700
See the oh inspect maybe inspect shows what they mean. No. Oh it does. There we go

2044
02:59:03,780 --> 02:59:07,540
If you inspect it shows on the right side what each of those icons mean

2045
02:59:08,739 --> 02:59:10,340
Flushed right down

2046
02:59:10,340 --> 02:59:14,379
Did I unlock any other clothes?

2047
02:59:14,379 --> 02:59:18,139
I got just a shirt on my guy and I look even stupider when I don't have the full

2048
02:59:18,780 --> 02:59:20,379
little onesie

2049
02:59:20,379 --> 02:59:22,700
People saying that I have a this is a dad shirt

2050
02:59:24,700 --> 02:59:30,059
Is that your new shirt that tank top? Yeah, it's just like a dirty tank top. I think it looks good

2051
02:59:30,620 --> 02:59:32,620
I think it's like you yeah

2052
02:59:33,750 --> 02:59:37,479
Oh everybody, let's go check the weapons because it could be new

2053
02:59:38,040 --> 02:59:41,690
Actually, hold on same weapons

2054
02:59:42,010 --> 02:59:44,010
20 minutes

2055
02:59:44,010 --> 02:59:48,170
For you carry with you martial tokens of the omniscience blessings

2056
02:59:48,809 --> 02:59:50,809
Got a new axe

2057
02:59:52,629 --> 02:59:57,079
Oh

2058
02:59:57,079 --> 03:00:00,760
So is the only way for me to get that little sword we're talking about kraken is if it just

2059
03:00:01,239 --> 03:00:03,239
Is in the shop like when it refreshes?

2060
03:00:04,120 --> 03:00:05,399
um

2061
03:00:05,399 --> 03:00:08,280
Yes, unless did it say emperor's gift and

2062
03:00:09,299 --> 03:00:10,500
the end of the match

2063
03:00:10,500 --> 03:00:13,219
Um, I don't really read I don't do that

2064
03:00:13,299 --> 03:00:18,899
So if you check your you might have it because sometimes at the end of the match you just get a free weapon from

2065
03:00:19,139 --> 03:00:20,659
the emperor

2066
03:00:20,659 --> 03:00:24,979
Because he's very generous amazing. Yeah, I don't think i'm gonna buy anything. I just keep what I have

2067
03:00:27,770 --> 03:00:34,420
What the?

2068
03:00:34,420 --> 03:00:53,829
Family reunion. All right that that was a 3d movie. I've had 3d glasses. That'd be crazy

2069
03:00:54,389 --> 03:00:58,100
Yeah, I think are you guys gonna go?

2070
03:00:58,100 --> 03:01:02,139
Yeah, i'm ready. I believe so we could do a lights out one

2071
03:01:03,379 --> 03:01:08,180
I don't have a flashlight anymore. I sold the gun with the flashlight. Okay, that'd be the only one maybe

2072
03:01:14,040 --> 03:01:15,879
My guy's so ugly

2073
03:01:15,879 --> 03:01:20,700
Does the barber let you do like full cosmetic change or just hair?

2074
03:01:22,139 --> 03:01:23,819
uh

2075
03:01:23,819 --> 03:01:27,260
This this haircut just makes me look like such like a goofball

2076
03:01:30,200 --> 03:01:32,200
That's like your mom gave you that haircut

2077
03:01:33,319 --> 03:01:35,319
Have you seen where the barber is?

2078
03:01:35,479 --> 03:01:39,159
Yeah, I I had something else before maybe you can get one similar to mine

2079
03:01:39,799 --> 03:01:42,360
Yeah, somebody said I have the mo the three stooges cut. Yeah

2080
03:01:43,700 --> 03:01:52,569
Uh, i'll keep it. I'll keep it. So what's this one? Uh, this is the normal one. Oh no lights out

2081
03:02:01,190 --> 03:02:03,190
Oh, look at that new shirt

2082
03:02:03,909 --> 03:02:08,229
Okay

2083
03:02:08,229 --> 03:02:09,989
And there's snot

2084
03:02:09,989 --> 03:02:11,989
Hi

2085
03:02:12,229 --> 03:02:14,629
Hi folks. I wonder if eventually you can get

2086
03:02:15,270 --> 03:02:19,190
Big armor pieces or something. Sorry. I didn't do my feets guys. Give me a second

2087
03:02:20,059 --> 03:02:24,299
You guys you guys fan of feet you got 35 seconds. Oh brother

2088
03:02:25,639 --> 03:02:27,719
Um, you better check stuff. Exactly

2089
03:02:28,280 --> 03:02:31,540
Are these passives or do I have to do something?

2090
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:33,139
They're passives

2091
03:02:33,139 --> 03:02:37,379
You just have to select one of the three and it just will be on you permanently. Oh my god

2092
03:02:37,379 --> 03:02:40,420
There's too like there's too many words, dude. I thought I'd just pick one at random

2093
03:02:42,969 --> 03:02:46,010
We said just remember do you dye your hair? No, I don't this is

2094
03:02:47,180 --> 03:02:50,780
Weirdly enough and this is actually a good thing. But you know, obviously knock on wood

2095
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:52,459
um

2096
03:02:52,459 --> 03:02:54,459
I don't have any gray hair

2097
03:02:55,139 --> 03:02:57,940
And that's a little concerning because i'm getting a little older

2098
03:02:59,450 --> 03:03:02,329
I don't have any gray hair

2099
03:03:02,409 --> 03:03:08,309
I'm not looking forward to when I look in the mirror and there's just white hairs here. We'll see

2100
03:03:12,729 --> 03:03:13,610
Yeah

2101
03:03:13,610 --> 03:03:15,850
Let's move. We look so cool

2102
03:03:16,649 --> 03:03:18,649
We did just look really cool

2103
03:03:19,450 --> 03:03:23,610
So it'll be the same kind of layout, but will the mission be the same every time we'll change it up

2104
03:03:25,450 --> 03:03:29,530
Yeah, usually the things that change are the secondary objectives and

2105
03:03:30,649 --> 03:03:32,649
Whatever other modifiers around the level

2106
03:03:33,370 --> 03:03:35,370
You end up doing the same mission a lot

2107
03:03:38,569 --> 03:03:43,370
So I guess like any of those other modifiers, well, I think after this we can probably try a level three

2108
03:03:43,690 --> 03:03:45,530
Especially if sam's joining

2109
03:03:45,530 --> 03:03:50,969
Well, it's also I mean the levels are they're supposed to be played over and over again. That would be yeah very different

2110
03:03:52,489 --> 03:03:55,770
I feel like a dark modifier from two to three is very dramatic. Yeah

2111
03:03:56,329 --> 03:04:05,579
Change a lot of it. Yeah. All right. No, i'm not gonna waste any ammo not like last time

2112
03:04:15,899 --> 03:04:17,979
Wait, are we looking for grimoires again in this one?

2113
03:04:19,059 --> 03:04:24,020
See the mission thing it's just the last time it appeared I think under the main objective

2114
03:04:25,299 --> 03:04:26,659
No

2115
03:04:26,659 --> 03:04:28,819
Kraken, can I get a lore update on what i'm looking at here?

2116
03:04:29,540 --> 03:04:31,540
Did I miss his I punched what?

2117
03:04:33,659 --> 03:04:35,100
disco ball

2118
03:04:35,100 --> 03:04:38,059
Oh, no, wait a second. There's a skull on it. This is a sever

2119
03:04:44,469 --> 03:04:51,319
Test in past

2120
03:04:52,040 --> 03:05:04,420
Right in the teeth

2121
03:05:04,420 --> 03:05:06,440
Already ammo

2122
03:05:06,440 --> 03:05:07,399
cool

2123
03:05:07,399 --> 03:05:14,569
So kraken, do you have any do you have any blues?

2124
03:05:15,770 --> 03:05:17,770
Uh, yeah, so you have blue right now

2125
03:05:20,899 --> 03:05:22,899
I have one purple

2126
03:05:23,700 --> 03:05:25,379
You have a purple

2127
03:05:25,379 --> 03:05:26,520
Yeah

2128
03:05:26,520 --> 03:05:27,559
You can

2129
03:05:27,559 --> 03:05:29,559
I mean at the level you're at you start getting purples

2130
03:05:30,649 --> 03:05:32,649
Oh like purple weapons. Yeah

2131
03:05:45,270 --> 03:05:58,069
It didn't hit oh my god, what's your favorite bit of warhammer war?

2132
03:05:59,559 --> 03:06:01,159
uh

2133
03:06:01,159 --> 03:06:02,489
oh

2134
03:06:02,489 --> 03:06:03,690
I

2135
03:06:03,690 --> 03:06:05,659
What's that sound?

2136
03:06:06,620 --> 03:06:09,909
Okay, cool

2137
03:06:09,909 --> 03:06:12,600
I like just the concept of like

2138
03:06:13,719 --> 03:06:15,719
so the the empire

2139
03:06:15,879 --> 03:06:20,040
you know colonizes thousands and thousands of planets and then

2140
03:06:21,319 --> 03:06:25,159
Some shit goes down and they basically can't travel for like a few thousand years

2141
03:06:26,600 --> 03:06:30,200
And so these planets these colonies just don't hear back from

2142
03:06:30,920 --> 03:06:33,000
You know the emperor for thousands of years

2143
03:06:33,719 --> 03:06:37,159
And then they show up one day and they're like, all right time to pay back the back taxes that you owe

2144
03:06:37,639 --> 03:06:43,159
Everyone's like no, fuck that and then they just burn their planet and take it back. They're like, no, fuck you. This is our planet

2145
03:06:43,479 --> 03:06:45,479
Oh the empire

2146
03:06:46,500 --> 03:06:48,920
Exactly. Sorry. I forgot I was streaming

2147
03:06:50,680 --> 03:06:52,680
I was just like blocking in playing

2148
03:06:53,719 --> 03:06:56,469
This game does that man. I just like

2149
03:07:03,350 --> 03:07:10,809
How are you still alive shit, uh, there's a lot of people over here

2150
03:07:11,530 --> 03:07:26,629
with the actual

2151
03:07:31,030 --> 03:07:34,809
Too much magic. Oh, right. That's the thing. I forgot to pace myself

2152
03:07:40,870 --> 03:07:42,870
Thanks for the help fellas

2153
03:07:48,520 --> 03:07:50,200
I actually need that

2154
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:52,200
Sorry, uh, you get the next one

2155
03:07:53,430 --> 03:08:02,440
Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, you probably needed to do though. We have to share it to find a big uh, ammo case somewhere

2156
03:08:03,079 --> 03:08:06,600
I think that's like a full ammo refill for everyone. Yeah, here's you know

2157
03:08:07,559 --> 03:08:08,680
Oh

2158
03:08:08,680 --> 03:08:14,299
Oops, you're a person

2159
03:08:14,299 --> 03:08:17,579
Did you just shoot? Oh, there's a tried over there

2160
03:08:19,540 --> 03:08:21,299
grenades anybody grenades

2161
03:08:21,299 --> 03:08:24,569
Ammo here for you smush

2162
03:08:28,729 --> 03:08:35,079
That's a good question are there any dances in the game not that I've found

2163
03:08:37,260 --> 03:08:40,379
We could come up with one like this. Oh, yeah

2164
03:08:41,020 --> 03:08:44,469
Oh, wait, there is actually hold on. Is there ready? Yeah, look at me

2165
03:08:48,489 --> 03:08:50,489
Wait, I did it wrong

2166
03:08:51,450 --> 03:09:00,180
Oh, it's a slide can I do that if you run and slide and then spin around looks freaking sick. Yeah

2167
03:09:02,739 --> 03:09:04,739
Cool that was pretty cool

2168
03:09:04,899 --> 03:09:07,780
Oh, oh, he actually calls out who has the lowest ammo. I guess

2169
03:09:08,420 --> 03:09:13,219
Yeah, that's cool. Oh, if you actually look uh next to all of our names, there's a little ammunition

2170
03:09:13,700 --> 03:09:20,020
Yeah, it's fine based on the color of it is how much ammunition. Oh like the game automatically like called out big man

2171
03:09:23,139 --> 03:09:25,139
Dog just hit a front flip

2172
03:09:26,700 --> 03:09:31,979
All right, don't waste ammo. Let's stop it. Okay. I just love shooting the grenade. Wait, can I heal on that thing?

2173
03:09:32,940 --> 03:09:33,979
Yeah

2174
03:09:33,979 --> 03:09:35,979
I don't know if there's any left. Yeah

2175
03:09:38,950 --> 03:09:48,040
I'll get it

2176
03:09:48,600 --> 03:09:50,600
What the hell was that?

2177
03:09:50,840 --> 03:09:52,920
He just got his head shot almost all the way off

2178
03:09:53,719 --> 03:09:59,479
He shot me through the wall. That was so that was sad. Prykin? I'm gonna take care of him

2179
03:10:00,440 --> 03:10:03,639
Prykin? What? You all right? Yeah

2180
03:10:05,399 --> 03:10:07,319
Okay. All right

2181
03:10:07,319 --> 03:10:13,079
Wow, it hit me too. Be careful. Where is he? I'll shoot him if I can find him. Oh, there he is. Got him

2182
03:10:15,340 --> 03:10:17,590
These guys are jerks

2183
03:10:17,590 --> 03:10:21,590
This guy I managed it on hard and harder whatever those things will kill you in one hit

2184
03:10:23,590 --> 03:10:25,590
That's probably sad

2185
03:10:26,069 --> 03:10:28,069
Okay

2186
03:10:28,149 --> 03:10:35,000
Let's go

2187
03:10:39,319 --> 03:10:45,959
Oh, yeah, maybe modifiers in general make more of the uh hard enemies

2188
03:10:49,299 --> 03:10:51,299
Oh

2189
03:11:01,209 --> 03:11:03,209
Oh boy

2190
03:11:05,110 --> 03:11:13,579
Oh, okay. Uh, no, come here, please

2191
03:11:14,540 --> 03:11:34,120
I thank you for killing that guy because I couldn't yeah, I definitely should not do that. It's way too slow

2192
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:39,739
What are you doing the hacking there's a little mini game in

2193
03:11:40,620 --> 03:11:44,620
In this fight that you have to do. I bet snot would be pretty good at it

2194
03:11:44,940 --> 03:11:46,940
Yeah, you should get it. That's nice

2195
03:11:47,020 --> 03:11:52,139
Does that actually affect the speed of the little bar like your class? Uh, the auger does. Yeah, it's just slower in general

2196
03:11:54,940 --> 03:11:58,979
Oh guys, i'm not gonna lie I tried to do it but I didn't know how to

2197
03:12:00,729 --> 03:12:06,729
All right. I'm guarding you snot go for it. Okay, big guy. Hey guy. Oh, yeah, we've got a just a typical hack here

2198
03:12:12,899 --> 03:12:16,420
Yeah, we got the uh motherboard might be fried on this one guys

2199
03:12:17,219 --> 03:12:19,219
What's wrong with it? Uh, oh

2200
03:12:19,940 --> 03:12:24,899
Yeah, it just needs some. Oh, there we go. Need a little tweaking. I got it guys. It's one of those 4090s with the uh

2201
03:12:25,620 --> 03:12:30,180
High voltage pin, right? It catches on fire. Yeah. Yeah, exactly that you nailed it

2202
03:12:31,139 --> 03:12:37,780
Isn't the 4090 like as big as uh, like five bricks laid on top of each other basically, yeah

2203
03:12:39,780 --> 03:12:42,100
As much power as a typical household

2204
03:12:47,129 --> 03:12:51,049
That's what they use to wipe the cold winters to warm the winters in this universe

2205
03:12:52,500 --> 03:12:54,500
4090s. Yeah

2206
03:13:00,229 --> 03:13:02,229
It's mr. Krabs

2207
03:13:11,719 --> 03:13:16,649
Right into the fire

2208
03:13:16,649 --> 03:13:20,889
Uh snot more uh more hacking up for you if you want. All right, let's see what I can do

2209
03:13:25,290 --> 03:13:27,290
Game is fun as fuck

2210
03:13:32,180 --> 03:13:37,780
Yeah, I like this like especially what you said after getting a weapon. That's more your play style. Yeah

2211
03:13:39,399 --> 03:13:41,700
That changes so much

2212
03:13:41,780 --> 03:13:46,899
Okay, getting this uh axe versus the shovel like i'm actually killing people with melee now, which is nice

2213
03:13:48,020 --> 03:13:50,420
Oh snot need some gatorade i'm getting hurt

2214
03:13:51,379 --> 03:13:56,540
My electrolytes are all screwed up. Mr. Krabs is my favorite warhammer character

2215
03:14:01,319 --> 03:14:09,100
They're actually the slaneshi demons all have like crab claws and tentacles and shit do they yeah guy's throwing a grenade

2216
03:14:12,389 --> 03:14:17,520
Is he still alive oops

2217
03:14:20,299 --> 03:14:23,420
Don't help him let him think about what he's done. Yeah, he's got to learn the hard way

2218
03:14:24,940 --> 03:14:28,479
I start pinching his fingers. Yeah, just start like stepping on my fingers

2219
03:14:41,159 --> 03:14:43,159
Yeah, it's been like three oh

2220
03:14:44,040 --> 03:14:49,959
Oh, I thought it was only when the power was out. I thought it was the powers up. I'm gonna break them. I'm gonna break them

2221
03:14:51,079 --> 03:15:03,899
This is bad guys. This is very this is very bad. I would say

2222
03:15:05,180 --> 03:15:07,180
Oh snot's down too. I put down healing

2223
03:15:08,059 --> 03:15:12,819
Uh, what no he's choking you. Yeah

2224
03:15:13,620 --> 03:15:15,620
I don't know if we can kill him in time. Where's the healing?

2225
03:15:21,129 --> 03:15:22,729
No more shouty

2226
03:15:22,729 --> 03:15:25,290
Where'd he go? Oh, he's gone. It's like a witch. I guess

2227
03:15:27,530 --> 03:15:29,930
Other than that dark mission I guess where you have to kill it

2228
03:15:31,530 --> 03:15:33,530
Wait, I disturbed him

2229
03:15:33,610 --> 03:15:36,729
No, I did buddy. Oh, we lost two. He's dead, too

2230
03:15:38,170 --> 03:15:41,790
He died separately he died unrelated cut we have to rescue

2231
03:15:42,110 --> 03:15:44,110
Natural

2232
03:15:44,350 --> 03:15:46,590
Wow that fucking hurts

2233
03:15:47,870 --> 03:15:50,360
I'm gonna pass you a note. We're gonna go rescue

2234
03:15:52,360 --> 03:15:56,440
All right, we're good. Yep. We just gotta keep up keep ourselves alive until we just run it

2235
03:15:58,440 --> 03:16:01,559
Where are they down here up ahead? Yeah, they're both down there each other

2236
03:16:02,200 --> 03:16:05,959
Oh, we got a swarm of dudes. Oh my goodness. All right grenade

2237
03:16:07,469 --> 03:16:10,270
Don't yeah, i'll get him. Oh, that was a lot of bodies

2238
03:16:10,670 --> 03:16:14,200
I should need you. Glad you were close

2239
03:16:20,959 --> 03:16:25,180
Does anyone need ammo right now? Uh, I do

2240
03:16:26,059 --> 03:16:29,819
But if you need it more than me, I can use the knife. I have a I have an ammo box

2241
03:16:29,899 --> 03:16:33,180
So I can the bag. Oh cool. Yeah, I definitely need it then

2242
03:16:33,739 --> 03:16:35,739
Let's find a good spot where we can all get something

2243
03:16:36,379 --> 03:16:38,120
Right here

2244
03:16:38,120 --> 03:16:42,680
Oh, wait, do it. Did I I thought I did maybe I guess that wasn't what I thought it was. Is it healing?

2245
03:16:43,319 --> 03:16:46,040
No, I guess it was just like a big bag of ammo

2246
03:16:46,040 --> 03:16:57,100
Like yeah, still not familiar with what all the pickups look like like that. What is that?

2247
03:17:00,700 --> 03:17:05,069
What's happening giant raid is a raid who raided what happened

2248
03:17:06,729 --> 03:17:11,530
big raid

2249
03:17:11,530 --> 03:17:13,850
Huge raid. All right. Who was it?

2250
03:17:14,569 --> 03:17:17,770
Somebody said there was like 40 000 people. Are you serious? Who did it?

2251
03:17:18,569 --> 03:17:22,350
Thank you. Whoever it was

2252
03:17:23,069 --> 03:17:25,069
Who raided me with 40 000 people?

2253
03:17:29,159 --> 03:17:33,239
Oh, you're just bullshit. This was where I saw the book last time, but I don't think we have that mission, right?

2254
03:17:33,479 --> 03:17:35,479
No, we don't have any

2255
03:17:46,760 --> 03:17:51,659
You got a

2256
03:17:51,659 --> 03:17:53,659
Medical thing here. Oh bag. Yeah

2257
03:17:54,700 --> 03:17:55,819
Ow

2258
03:17:55,819 --> 03:17:57,500
I can do that too

2259
03:17:57,500 --> 03:18:00,940
I missed oh my god, that fucking hurts so bad

2260
03:18:01,899 --> 03:18:08,010
So is there a sound right before they fire? I I need to i'm not dodging them. I really need to dodge them

2261
03:18:08,090 --> 03:18:10,090
I need to remember the dodge even exists

2262
03:18:10,969 --> 03:18:12,969
I got one of the dodge

2263
03:18:14,010 --> 03:18:17,770
Excuse me, who's shooting me? There's another sniper. I think you got him

2264
03:18:27,479 --> 03:18:31,319
Never mind, I thought there was an outside area. There's just this giant lit up area

2265
03:18:32,420 --> 03:18:33,799
sanctuary

2266
03:18:33,799 --> 03:18:37,389
Okay, we do have an ammo box. I think we need it, right? Yeah

2267
03:18:39,229 --> 03:18:41,469
You missed them all they were here

2268
03:18:41,469 --> 03:18:44,829
It would be kind of sad. I want to push these guys off one sec to watch this

2269
03:18:45,790 --> 03:18:48,079
Sorry

2270
03:18:48,079 --> 03:18:50,079
doggy

2271
03:18:50,479 --> 03:18:53,760
Where are they pretty good in this game? Yeah

2272
03:18:55,040 --> 03:18:57,680
Oh my god, why can't we kill this dog?

2273
03:19:00,399 --> 03:19:04,079
Are you trying to get the push thing? Oh you're trying to do the shove. All right

2274
03:19:06,399 --> 03:19:12,959
Dar that's that would be so sad if 40 000 people rated and the view count did not go up by one viewer

2275
03:19:14,540 --> 03:19:19,100
They all left immediately. They didn't like that. That would be very sad actually

2276
03:19:21,959 --> 03:19:27,239
Dude 40 000 people raid. All right, here it comes. My view count goes down

2277
03:19:28,040 --> 03:19:31,290
That would be sad

2278
03:19:31,290 --> 03:19:36,250
That was a really bad idea and i'm i'm muted in the comms right now. So they're probably like what is he doing?

2279
03:19:43,280 --> 03:19:53,209
I'm stuck

2280
03:19:53,209 --> 03:20:01,360
Okay, I gotta mute. Sorry. I was muted. Oh, no, they left too

2281
03:20:06,399 --> 03:20:08,430
Hello

2282
03:20:08,430 --> 03:20:11,229
Oh, that was weird. Oh wait, did it sound like we left?

2283
03:20:12,430 --> 03:20:17,309
That was very funny because everyone just said that a raid of 40 000 people came in

2284
03:20:18,329 --> 03:20:20,250
And they would I mean there was chat was just full of shit

2285
03:20:20,329 --> 03:20:25,049
They were just like oh huge raid like 50 000 people i'm like who the fuck is doing that who's live right now?

2286
03:20:25,850 --> 03:20:30,250
And then you guys weren't like they were like, oh they all left and then like that was bull bullshit

2287
03:20:30,489 --> 03:20:32,489
I come back here and you guys aren't here

2288
03:20:33,370 --> 03:20:37,290
So it was like weird going for like an hour. Yeah, you looked over and you're streaming

2289
03:20:38,090 --> 03:20:40,729
Just to a party of zero and you've just been alone

2290
03:20:42,090 --> 03:20:45,020
That would be terrifying

2291
03:20:45,020 --> 03:20:47,579
Do you guys have stress dreams about streaming? Yep

2292
03:20:48,459 --> 03:20:49,579
worse

2293
03:20:49,579 --> 03:20:55,420
The classic the you i'm i'm live while i'm lying in bed and I didn't need to be entertaining you want to go around

2294
03:20:55,739 --> 03:21:00,700
Let's go around the uh, let's go around the table here. What's what's your what's your like nightmare stream dream?

2295
03:21:01,899 --> 03:21:03,899
I was actually the other day

2296
03:21:03,899 --> 03:21:08,299
I was thinking about how lucky I was because I have stress dreams about like school stuff

2297
03:21:08,860 --> 03:21:10,860
Like i'm trying to like find my class

2298
03:21:11,180 --> 03:21:13,979
But I was like, you know what? I was telling my chat. I don't have

2299
03:21:14,540 --> 03:21:19,260
Stress dreams about streaming that's I feel like I should have by now and then like that night

2300
03:21:19,340 --> 03:21:21,659
I had a dream that my camera was on

2301
03:21:22,379 --> 03:21:25,260
And I like was basically face revealing on accident

2302
03:21:25,579 --> 03:21:28,780
But I was trying to cover my like I was trying to cover my face

2303
03:21:29,340 --> 03:21:33,819
I couldn't move from in front of the camera. So I was just covering up my different facial features, but I only

2304
03:21:34,540 --> 03:21:36,139
Oh really?

2305
03:21:36,139 --> 03:21:40,059
Yeah, it was like I was covering like only my mouth. Oh my god. No, they can still see my eyes

2306
03:21:40,219 --> 03:21:42,219
It's like a thousand people just spawned

2307
03:21:42,780 --> 03:21:44,780
What the hell

2308
03:21:52,360 --> 03:21:53,399
Whoa

2309
03:21:53,399 --> 03:21:54,600

2310
03:21:54,600 --> 03:22:00,760
Dude, I keep having the same stream nightmare stress stream. Really? Yeah, and it's it's happened like at least four times

2311
03:22:00,760 --> 03:22:02,280
I keep having it

2312
03:22:02,280 --> 03:22:03,399
so

2313
03:22:03,399 --> 03:22:06,120
I'm I'm naked from the waist down with a webcam on

2314
03:22:07,639 --> 03:22:13,000
And I stand up and I realize oh shit. I'm naked people probably see my you know, you know

2315
03:22:13,879 --> 03:22:17,000
And I freak out and nobody in the chat says anything

2316
03:22:18,379 --> 03:22:19,899
And then I go fuck normal

2317
03:22:19,899 --> 03:22:24,620
Well, no, it's just like because i'm like did I show my did I did that just happen because i'm naked right now

2318
03:22:25,180 --> 03:22:27,500
And like I stand up a little too far and i'm like, wait a minute

2319
03:22:27,500 --> 03:22:30,379
Is that what that was that on in frame in my webcam view?

2320
03:22:31,260 --> 03:22:34,620
And then I I don't and one or two people in the chat will say oh my god

2321
03:22:34,700 --> 03:22:36,700
Did anybody see that and i'm like fuck

2322
03:22:37,280 --> 03:22:39,040
And I go back and look at the vod

2323
03:22:39,040 --> 03:22:43,440
And I go wicked slow frame by frame and I see that I just barely get it in in frame

2324
03:22:43,680 --> 03:22:50,569
You just barely get your dick in frame. Well, hey, come on. This is where the spawn's free, man. Oh, sorry. Sorry

2325
03:22:51,049 --> 03:22:53,049
We can't say that

2326
03:22:53,850 --> 03:22:59,129
Anyways the warhammer lore. Well, can we go over that again? I haven't having a lot of dreams about warhammer

2327
03:22:59,770 --> 03:23:03,530
Yeah, dude. I had so many dreams about warhammer. I especially the uh

2328
03:23:04,969 --> 03:23:05,909
the

2329
03:23:05,909 --> 03:23:07,909
unbelievable down in warhammer

2330
03:23:08,790 --> 03:23:14,950
I wonder does the streaming exist on hyper worlds?

2331
03:23:16,170 --> 03:23:18,170
Yeah, there's a streamer

2332
03:23:18,649 --> 03:23:26,659
I don't know imagine the freaking impression. What is the entertainment like in the 40k universe? You don't really get that

2333
03:23:27,059 --> 03:23:29,059
Yeah, true. I guess no

2334
03:23:30,579 --> 03:23:32,579
Too grim dark for fun

2335
03:23:33,979 --> 03:23:38,540
I was naked in warhammer. I took both the crafting materials fight me for them

2336
03:23:40,040 --> 03:23:44,040
Well, they're shared so thanks. Oh, oh there's a health attack here and

2337
03:23:44,680 --> 03:23:48,040
Uh, i'm gonna hold on to it. What's your streaming stress stream cracking?

2338
03:23:49,079 --> 03:23:50,840
um

2339
03:23:50,840 --> 03:23:53,399
I so I talk in my sleep sometimes and

2340
03:23:54,920 --> 03:23:59,000
I have been told that when i've had a streaming stress stream

2341
03:23:59,639 --> 03:24:01,639
I'll like just randomly

2342
03:24:01,799 --> 03:24:04,680
Talk like i'm on stream like there's a certain cadence to your voice when you're on stream

2343
03:24:04,680 --> 03:24:07,239
You know and i'll just like be rolling around and then i'll just be like

2344
03:24:07,959 --> 03:24:10,280
Like hey, what's going on?

2345
03:24:11,159 --> 03:24:13,159
really

2346
03:24:14,280 --> 03:24:18,200
You do like you do like the youtuber voice in like you to sleep talk

2347
03:24:18,920 --> 03:24:21,079
Just while under the covers in the dark

2348
03:24:22,389 --> 03:24:27,829
Because i'm convinced that i'm on stream. That's I need to say something entertaining. It's really horrible

2349
03:24:29,399 --> 03:24:35,639
That's so yeah, that's so scary. That's so like stress inducing. Yeah, there's gonna be so many studies on on us

2350
03:24:35,639 --> 03:24:41,479
I'm sure like, you know years for now like this is done to our collective brains. How did a dog get in here?

2351
03:24:42,440 --> 03:24:48,120
That's how we doing man, i'm not a big sleep talker, but I did uh wake myself up with a fart the other night

2352
03:24:48,920 --> 03:24:50,360
Oh my god

2353
03:24:50,360 --> 03:24:52,360
And it was really embarrassing

2354
03:24:53,079 --> 03:24:55,559
I feel like my my farts aren't loud enough to do that

2355
03:24:56,520 --> 03:24:59,190
Oh your weak farther

2356
03:24:59,190 --> 03:25:02,200
I mean kind I mean, it's just like this. It's just

2357
03:25:03,260 --> 03:25:05,260
I can't get this guy off

2358
03:25:05,399 --> 03:25:07,399
Deficiencies in your diet. I think

2359
03:25:07,899 --> 03:25:13,979
This guy won't leave me alone

2360
03:25:14,139 --> 03:25:16,139
Leave me the fuck alone

2361
03:25:17,299 --> 03:25:24,840
Okay

2362
03:25:36,020 --> 03:25:42,379
Oh this part was actually kind of tricky oh shit i'm in trouble actually

2363
03:25:51,079 --> 03:26:02,329
So obviously the game the game looks kind of easy well we are not playing on any hard difficulty right now

2364
03:26:04,329 --> 03:26:06,700
This is the second one, but yeah

2365
03:26:07,420 --> 03:26:09,579
After this mission, we're gonna bump it up the level. I think

2366
03:26:10,459 --> 03:26:13,180
Sniper. Oh that hits hard. Yeah that where where is it?

2367
03:26:13,899 --> 03:26:17,340
I see him across the way. I got him. Oh nice shot

2368
03:26:18,540 --> 03:26:20,940
And I that was not an e3 presentation. I really mean it

2369
03:26:27,110 --> 03:26:29,270
The net gun uh trapper or whatever

2370
03:26:33,420 --> 03:26:36,629
That guy live

2371
03:26:36,629 --> 03:26:38,149
All right, i'm gonna take it

2372
03:26:39,750 --> 03:26:44,389
You idiot throw them up from up here if you want to come upstairs here you might uh, actually never mind

2373
03:26:44,469 --> 03:26:47,909
No, don't throw it over there. I can move pretty quickly with it. Right? That's one of my perks. Yeah. Yeah

2374
03:26:48,629 --> 03:26:51,350
Do we have any more inside this train? No, I guess that's all okay

2375
03:26:52,729 --> 03:26:56,540
So, uh, oh you're okay. I don't know

2376
03:26:57,659 --> 03:26:59,420
I don't know

2377
03:26:59,420 --> 03:27:03,659
I I was looking at chat and then I heard a drop he was just carrying the thing

2378
03:27:03,899 --> 03:27:07,979
Correctly, it drops it turns around winds up a big knife attack on my neck

2379
03:27:08,459 --> 03:27:10,860
Uh, I was startling

2380
03:27:14,649 --> 03:27:29,559
You guys are in trouble, all right

2381
03:27:34,520 --> 03:27:36,120
All right, we're good

2382
03:27:36,120 --> 03:27:39,700
All right, that's all them from this area

2383
03:27:41,879 --> 03:27:47,079
You're alive right now. I was gonna say that's why I always check people when they're dumb

2384
03:27:51,610 --> 03:27:54,250
I'm getting the rest of my push kills after this

2385
03:27:55,049 --> 03:27:58,569
Look at this guy's tummy

2386
03:27:58,569 --> 03:28:01,270
Anyone want to look at the tummy? I would love to

2387
03:28:03,959 --> 03:28:07,319
What the hell is wrong with you brody that's gross

2388
03:28:11,479 --> 03:28:24,409
Large enemy incoming wave. You know what? I'll say it screw these guys

2389
03:28:25,129 --> 03:28:26,329
Whoa

2390
03:28:26,329 --> 03:28:28,729
No, I agree hate all heresy in all forms

2391
03:28:29,530 --> 03:28:32,620
I think my guy got arrested for heresy, but it was like

2392
03:28:33,899 --> 03:28:38,379
Just like heresy. Yeah, like just a little bit of lighting arrest him again

2393
03:28:41,690 --> 03:28:43,690
Turn him into curtains

2394
03:28:46,409 --> 03:28:52,030
Curtain turn him into a nintendo 64. I want to have tons of fun playing mario

2395
03:28:53,049 --> 03:28:56,569
Who determines what they get turned into? Yeah, it'll be the most fun job

2396
03:28:57,770 --> 03:29:01,770
Just coming up this thing strikes me as a curtain the curtain rot. Let's make it the curtain

2397
03:29:06,739 --> 03:29:08,739
Okay, here we go

2398
03:29:08,819 --> 03:29:11,940
You guys are torn on that one

2399
03:29:11,940 --> 03:29:16,659
You should do a uh, they should do like an online quiz like personality quiz for which type of server you'd become

2400
03:29:17,219 --> 03:29:19,219
Yes, dude

2401
03:29:19,219 --> 03:29:22,360
That's what's up people need I think we're almost done, right?

2402
03:29:29,639 --> 03:29:31,639
I'm trying to get him guys

2403
03:29:36,969 --> 03:29:38,969
I can't believe I didn't hit him

2404
03:29:39,770 --> 03:29:41,770
All right, i'm putting the last one in

2405
03:29:41,850 --> 03:29:46,389
Watch out that sniper might still be up there. We got him. I got him. All right, we're good

2406
03:29:47,030 --> 03:29:49,030
Everybody make it to the extraction

2407
03:29:49,989 --> 03:30:01,180
You need to shove people again i'll try a little bit but I don't think the worst servitor options are

2408
03:30:03,420 --> 03:30:07,899
Maybe a bidet bidet. Yeah, good. I'm telling you toilet servitor would be awful just going

2409
03:30:09,100 --> 03:30:11,100
like blowing the fucking

2410
03:30:11,500 --> 03:30:15,420
Listen, I think the point was clear. I don't think you needed to make a fart noise

2411
03:30:17,180 --> 03:30:21,579
Oh guys, you're gonna have to go on without me. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you

2412
03:30:22,139 --> 03:30:23,739

Gotcha now we're split up watch out. There's fire. Oh wait, that's set up fire. Goodbye

2414
03:30:32,620 --> 03:30:37,219
Nice

2415
03:30:37,540 --> 03:30:40,739
Someone said imagine having to call the tech priest to fix your toilet

2416
03:30:42,260 --> 03:30:45,700
I don't know anything about war hammer lore, but is there a dude who just

2417
03:30:46,739 --> 03:30:53,459
Who deals with all the servitors? Yeah, the mechanics are basically priests in this so they just pray to fix it. Yeah pray to fix it

2418
03:30:54,420 --> 03:31:01,780
Oh, what a weird job. Oh, I got a foe rend mkv ripper gun

2419
03:31:02,500 --> 03:31:04,020
sword class unlocked

2420
03:31:04,020 --> 03:31:10,059
You know some might consider we have a weird job so we can't really be judging. It's true

2421
03:31:12,329 --> 03:31:14,329
I got ten thousand almost

2422
03:31:15,750 --> 03:31:17,750
Oh, no, that's just current. That's not currency

2423
03:31:18,870 --> 03:31:22,709
Hey, you guys feel you want to do another one?

2424
03:31:22,709 --> 03:31:24,709
Hell, yeah, let's get up

2425

2426
03:31:37,739 --> 03:31:40,299
He's gonna go back to uh

2427
03:31:40,299 --> 03:31:44,059
banning and timing out a lot of you fucking weirdos

2428
03:31:44,700 --> 03:31:52,280
I look over and she's like message deleted message deleted ban ban ban like he's just back in it. He's back in it back in the chair

2429
03:31:56,629 --> 03:32:04,420
I love how i'm getting defaced for that, but you guys called me a weirdo 20 minutes ago. It's not fair

2430
03:32:04,739 --> 03:32:07,059
They can dish it but they can't take it. I know it's not fair

2431
03:32:07,700 --> 03:32:13,379
That's really the chat experience in a nutshell, isn't it? They can dish but they can't take

2432
03:32:15,370 --> 03:32:18,010
It's different because ours is true. And well

2433
03:32:20,549 --> 03:32:22,549
You should start training them to like

2434
03:32:22,870 --> 03:32:24,870
like take abuse better

2435
03:32:25,670 --> 03:32:27,670
Just have like streams dedicated to

2436
03:32:28,649 --> 03:32:30,649
Just getting them used to getting roasted a little

2437
03:32:33,260 --> 03:32:35,260
We all have the same clothes

2438
03:32:37,670 --> 03:32:41,110
I'm going to the barber. I need okay. I'm gonna make a different haircut or something

2439
03:32:42,700 --> 03:32:44,700
I think you can rock it if you have confidence

2440
03:32:46,170 --> 03:32:50,969
Maybe a different beard. Where's the barber? It's over here somewhere. I just I just think I crashed my game

2441
03:32:51,450 --> 03:32:53,450
I think I exited this menu too quick

2442
03:32:57,479 --> 03:33:00,040
Where's the barber?

2443
03:33:00,040 --> 03:33:06,200
He's on the left side if you're looking at the green disney world thing. Does this cost money or no?

2444
03:33:07,000 --> 03:33:26,280
Barb is free

2445
03:33:26,280 --> 03:33:28,250
Oh, man

2446
03:33:28,250 --> 03:33:30,250
I think this is pretty good. Actually

2447
03:33:33,420 --> 03:33:35,420
I think that's I love it

2448
03:33:37,930 --> 03:33:39,930
Do they have many mohawk options?

2449
03:33:40,170 --> 03:33:42,170
They do actually I think they might yeah

2450
03:33:53,459 --> 03:34:03,909
All right. I like this so far

2451
03:34:03,909 --> 03:34:07,670
Kraken, can you invite me again on this night? This one actually I think is it

2452
03:34:08,469 --> 03:34:48,469
That's that one I made my decision you said your guy is good. I think so. I'm just doing some scars. Yeah

2453
03:34:49,110 --> 03:35:00,120
I thought about adding some scars, but am I in your game? I think you just joined it

2454
03:35:00,600 --> 03:35:05,770
Let me tell what maybe I can find some cool. Maybe I can get a new mustache

2455
03:35:06,489 --> 03:35:08,840
I was gonna have no tattoos

2456
03:35:08,840 --> 03:35:17,590
It's not as too iconic. Actually, I don't think I could change them

2457
03:35:19,030 --> 03:35:22,950
Oh wait, because the way he is I I have I can make my eye color different because of the

2458
03:35:23,850 --> 03:35:26,569
The home world i'm from oh you're from katia, huh?

2459
03:35:28,489 --> 03:35:31,850
Oh, okay. Where are you at? Let me see your new hair

2460
03:35:32,649 --> 03:35:34,649
Everyone loves katia

2461
03:35:39,350 --> 03:35:46,500
Kraken, how do you get the little gems the little gemstones to level up your weapons specifically the ones

2462
03:35:47,299 --> 03:35:50,100
That are like blue font. They look like a little cube

2463
03:35:50,819 --> 03:35:51,700
uh

2464
03:35:51,700 --> 03:35:54,579
Those are just rare the rare ones, but you can find them

2465
03:35:55,219 --> 03:35:57,530
Out in the world katia. Yeah

2466
03:36:04,569 --> 03:36:05,530
Oh

2467
03:36:05,530 --> 03:36:08,010
I got blues now. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, it's important

2468
03:36:11,079 --> 03:36:12,520
You have blue eyes

2469
03:36:12,520 --> 03:36:14,889
I got blue weapons available

2470
03:36:15,290 --> 03:36:16,950
to buy

2471
03:36:16,950 --> 03:36:27,030
Why this thing's just better? Oh, yeah, me too. I've got a little blue sword. Is this worth eight like all my money

2472
03:36:27,110 --> 03:36:29,590
It's a little bit. This is almost every cent that I have

2473
03:36:30,149 --> 03:36:36,250
That's the vicious cycle of this game. Hey

2474
03:36:37,270 --> 03:36:38,950
Hey, hello

2475
03:36:38,950 --> 03:36:44,149
Hello, i'm doing it. It's my buddy stripping. He

2476
03:36:44,950 --> 03:36:49,829
Is plays this game even more than me and has the giga chad augren

2477
03:36:50,629 --> 03:36:56,860
I want to see so bad. Do you know the lore stripping? I do know lore

2478
03:36:57,579 --> 03:37:00,500
All right

2479
03:37:00,500 --> 03:37:05,620
That's all that matters. How's the test? It's cool, man. I want to see uh, i'm also playing augren

2480
03:37:06,180 --> 03:37:10,340
And I I love augren and i've heard that you have a really cool augren

2481
03:37:10,819 --> 03:37:16,420
I'm very excited. He could be cooler. I've been trying to get this achievement done for some really cool armor, but

2482
03:37:16,979 --> 03:37:19,909
Uh, it is just too hard in the dark. I think

2483
03:37:22,020 --> 03:37:24,260
But the new stuff is uh is awesome

2484
03:37:24,979 --> 03:37:27,219
That they added today. Yeah. Yeah the power station

2485
03:37:28,100 --> 03:37:32,420
The witch like encounter freaked me the fuck out when I first saw it

2486
03:37:33,690 --> 03:37:35,690
I've only managed to kill it once dude

2487
03:37:36,649 --> 03:37:39,610
There yeah, especially in harder difficulties. I cannot imagine how hard it gets

2488
03:37:40,250 --> 03:37:44,889
So are we five are we gonna do the hard difficulties that we're about to do? I think we should do a three

2489
03:37:44,889 --> 03:37:46,889
Yeah, okay, we could totally do a three. Yeah

2490
03:37:47,209 --> 03:37:51,770
Uh, i'm gonna i've escorted these guys to the boss room. I'm gonna pretend i've dc'd good luck

2491
03:37:53,049 --> 03:37:57,290
Uh little small children, they're so dead and uh, let's go

2492
03:38:00,040 --> 03:38:02,040
Surely it's gonna go well

2493
03:38:02,299 --> 03:38:04,139
Hey, I think we're gonna be fine

2494
03:38:04,139 --> 03:38:09,670
I got my new weapon

2495
03:38:09,670 --> 03:38:12,629
Where are you at drama? What kind of weapons you uh you rocking?

2496
03:38:13,270 --> 03:38:14,629
I I got

2497
03:38:14,629 --> 03:38:17,270
i'm into the uh, the gauntlet the

2498
03:38:17,889 --> 03:38:20,389
Grenader gauntlet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah with the special

2499
03:38:21,030 --> 03:38:23,670
Explosive punch thing. Yeah, that's pretty sweet

2500
03:38:24,229 --> 03:38:26,549
Uh, I just got this new knife, which is pretty cool

2501
03:38:27,860 --> 03:38:30,579
I'm just standing in front of the uh, the mission thing if you want to come look at me. Um

2502
03:38:31,219 --> 03:38:34,120
Charlie, I think you were saying it

2503
03:38:34,120 --> 03:38:37,559
You're at what i'm just in front of the mission thing the big um green

2504
03:38:40,969 --> 03:38:42,729
I like the fresh cut dude

2505
03:38:42,729 --> 03:38:44,729
You're rocking it. You think it's good. Yeah

2506
03:38:46,620 --> 03:38:53,319
I think it looks pretty good

2507
03:38:53,319 --> 03:38:57,719
I would definitely uh uncheck the box show helm if I had this kind of a hairstyle

2508
03:38:58,680 --> 03:39:00,680
Yeah, i'm not wearing no

2509
03:39:02,409 --> 03:39:05,100
Wait, where are in front of the missions?

2510
03:39:06,860 --> 03:39:12,459
Oh, where are you? No, we don't do it lights out tier three. That might be a little rough. That might be scary

2511
03:39:12,620 --> 03:39:14,620
That'll be great. Come on

2512
03:39:15,100 --> 03:39:21,079
We don't have many flashlights we found. Wait, what level what level uh, what level are these two we got? Yeah

2513
03:39:22,040 --> 03:39:26,680
Six or seven years. Yeah. Yeah, I'm like a 20 on my main. So uh

2514
03:39:27,639 --> 03:39:32,219
Okay, well it's not though. Yeah, it's not six

2515
03:39:34,040 --> 03:39:36,860
Uh, okay

2516
03:39:36,940 --> 03:39:38,940
Yeah, nice posture

2517
03:39:39,750 --> 03:39:41,750
Okay, we could do a three with no

2518
03:39:41,989 --> 03:39:44,229
Uh modifiers or we could try and do like a light

2519
03:39:44,309 --> 03:39:48,229
I think it lights out to you because you get extra xp if you do lights out. That's why it's good. But

2520
03:39:49,270 --> 03:39:53,670
I think they haven't done a three before we should try. Okay. Yeah, let's do a three in daylight if we can

2521
03:39:53,829 --> 03:39:57,110
Yeah, where it's a little intimidating because we've never we're very new

2522
03:39:58,069 --> 03:40:00,700
You guys will do fine

2523
03:40:00,860 --> 03:40:05,909
Okay. All right. I've been struggling. I will say

2524
03:40:06,950 --> 03:40:11,510
Maybe you got your new staff. Yeah, I got the staff and the new knife

2525
03:40:12,309 --> 03:40:18,819
And i've gotten a lot of confidence the first missions. Look at that shield. Where'd you get that shield?

2526
03:40:20,149 --> 03:40:23,430
Soon, you will have a shield of your own. Oh damn smush

2527
03:40:23,989 --> 03:40:26,920
Looking good. Yeah, I cleaned up a little

2528
03:40:28,360 --> 03:40:30,360
I just took the clippers and just went like this

2529
03:40:30,920 --> 03:40:35,879
Um a few times a bit. Yeah as well grew up about 25 years

2530
03:40:37,219 --> 03:40:42,360
You like you guys like my sword that last mission was that bad, huh? That you aged significantly

2531
03:40:44,649 --> 03:40:47,690
We've been all look at these two lads. Oh my god

2532
03:40:48,729 --> 03:40:50,809
I feel like we're pissed to be in the same room together here

2533
03:40:52,409 --> 03:40:56,489
I want to see a full auger and team in this hill thing. It just crashes in the low

2534
03:40:56,729 --> 03:40:58,729
Doesn't even make it to the mission

2535
03:40:59,690 --> 03:41:03,049
I've been in the full auger team and it was a hot mess. No, it's the boys

2536
03:41:03,850 --> 03:41:08,329
Yeah, we're gonna do the boys here. Do you have to be balanced like an overwatch team?

2537
03:41:09,850 --> 03:41:13,770
Uh, it helps it helps but you don't have to like for example, we don't

2538
03:41:14,409 --> 03:41:18,170
We need someone that can kind of take out snipers and I don't really see in this group

2539
03:41:19,209 --> 03:41:21,209
Oh, i'll i'll handle that

2540
03:41:21,209 --> 03:41:22,649
Okay

2541
03:41:22,649 --> 03:41:27,850
Wait, i brought the flamers. Oops. Yeah, I don't have anything to deal with them either. Jeremy if you want to take a look at my gun

2542
03:41:28,170 --> 03:41:30,170
Yeah, what do you got like this one

2543
03:41:31,290 --> 03:41:33,290
What is that oh my goodness

2544
03:41:38,040 --> 03:41:40,540
Wow

2545
03:41:47,290 --> 03:41:52,010
I got a cool grenade launcher on my arm. I actually enjoy that. Oh, those are our friends

2546
03:41:55,750 --> 03:41:57,750
This new map is also really cool

2547
03:41:58,309 --> 03:42:01,590
It's pretty

2548
03:42:01,590 --> 03:42:07,690
So this is this is on hard this is on uh, yeah three out of five

2549
03:42:09,899 --> 03:42:13,100
So what's after hard? Is it just four and five?

2550
03:42:14,540 --> 03:42:16,540
Four and five, uh, no one

2551
03:42:18,899 --> 03:42:20,899
in within the dev team

2552
03:42:21,219 --> 03:42:25,459
Has beaten five really? Oh my goodness. I don't know if any players have beaten five, but

2553
03:42:26,819 --> 03:42:29,379
Five is just insane. Okay. Well

2554
03:42:29,940 --> 03:42:32,620
We're on a three

2555
03:42:32,620 --> 03:42:41,959
If you get threes down, this is like the juicy

2556
03:42:42,680 --> 03:42:47,079
I feel like I should be hanging out with snot. This shit is busting. All right, cool

2557
03:42:48,600 --> 03:42:53,399
Yeah, you know what? I don't know what's I don't know what's I don't know what's going on with snob. I kind of want to kiss him

2558
03:42:54,200 --> 03:42:55,639
Yeah, i'm

2559
03:42:55,639 --> 03:42:58,920
Kind of known as the cutest one in the group has a kissable face

2560
03:43:00,200 --> 03:43:02,340
Are these enemies or?

2561
03:43:02,340 --> 03:43:04,340
Yes, it's a safe bet

2562
03:43:06,020 --> 03:43:09,420
We can try to make friends with them i'm sure they listen for reason

2563
03:43:13,500 --> 03:43:20,629
I knew you weren't dead. I that's why I always check. Yeah, so on this difficulty we get more specials in general. So

2564
03:43:21,590 --> 03:43:23,590
Oh

2565
03:43:31,479 --> 03:43:40,600
Are these the bad guys? Yep, this is my time

2566
03:43:41,319 --> 03:43:43,479
This is going to be perfect. I'm I can't wait to watch this

2567
03:43:44,760 --> 03:43:55,239
I'm not used to seeing another big another big dude. Yeah, it's actually I like it

2568
03:43:56,040 --> 03:44:01,559
You feel safer. Does it make you safer? I actually kind of do I do feel safer

2569
03:44:03,020 --> 03:44:05,020
Wait till he throws down that shield

2570
03:44:06,709 --> 03:44:09,110
Oh sniper i'll get help guys. I'll take care of this

2571
03:44:09,829 --> 03:44:15,340
Oh

2572
03:44:15,659 --> 03:44:17,979
Oh this look at oh my god, there's a lot of people here

2573
03:44:19,260 --> 03:44:22,840
Oh guys, i'm gonna blow up. I'm sorry

2574
03:44:24,260 --> 03:44:30,100
I was every time I play with a psycher. I hear that exact quote and it's like they already know it's too low. Oh my goodness

2575
03:44:30,180 --> 03:44:32,180
Oh shit, I got dog on me

2576
03:44:33,879 --> 03:44:38,409
Oh, this is no joke level three

2577
03:44:40,040 --> 03:44:42,040
Yeah, there's a big difficulty spike

2578
03:44:42,120 --> 03:44:44,170
From two to three

2579
03:44:44,170 --> 03:44:46,729
Was that flaming?

2580
03:44:46,729 --> 03:44:48,170
I

2581
03:44:48,170 --> 03:44:56,219
Didn't kill that guy

2582
03:44:56,219 --> 03:44:58,219
All right. We're okay

2583
03:45:00,329 --> 03:45:03,290
On level four you need at least one augren to even survive

2584
03:45:04,170 --> 03:45:05,049
Really?

2585
03:45:05,049 --> 03:45:07,340
Would you guys agree with that?

2586
03:45:07,340 --> 03:45:12,069
Yeah

2587
03:45:12,069 --> 03:45:17,110
I made a mistake, but you know what the like special ability the augren is. Oh, sorry

2588
03:45:17,750 --> 03:45:21,110
I didn't see i'm gonna tank this. Oh, no, he's in someone else

2589
03:45:24,149 --> 03:45:26,149
He's on he's on me he's on me he's on me

2590
03:45:27,190 --> 03:45:29,020
I'm gonna die

2591
03:45:29,020 --> 03:45:31,020
Maybe he'll be okay. Let's pick him up

2592
03:45:31,180 --> 03:45:32,940
No, he's dead

2593
03:45:32,940 --> 03:45:34,940
Okay, let's we need him to focus me

2594
03:45:35,420 --> 03:45:37,420
Guys i'm gonna blow up again

2595
03:45:42,170 --> 03:45:48,090
All right, i'll push myself too hard he's killing stop just gonna kill himself. Okay. All right. Yeah, that's fine. It's fine

2596
03:45:48,809 --> 03:45:50,010
shit

2597
03:45:50,010 --> 03:45:52,010
Oh my nerves

2598
03:45:53,620 --> 03:45:55,620
So he leaves after two, right?

2599
03:45:55,700 --> 03:45:56,899
Yeah

2600
03:45:59,399 --> 03:46:03,500
That was incredible it's not just gave himself as a fucking sacrifice

2601
03:46:04,620 --> 03:46:06,620
Yeah, it was almost wait. What just happened

2602
03:46:07,500 --> 03:46:13,899
So snot blew up because of his own mechanic like he overheated. Yeah while he was on the ground. Oh god

2603
03:46:15,020 --> 03:46:17,020
I'm stuck between two augren

2604
03:46:17,500 --> 03:46:20,139
Okay, okay. That's all right. Things are fine. I'm gonna throw a grenade

2605
03:46:21,420 --> 03:46:30,579
It didn't work for another grenade. This is a mess

2606
03:46:32,090 --> 03:46:33,209
Yeah

2607
03:46:33,209 --> 03:46:35,610
All right auger down

2608
03:46:35,690 --> 03:46:41,190
Sorry, I got us some more experience. I got us more xp for that

2609
03:46:42,709 --> 03:46:44,709
Yeah, we get for the kill

2610
03:46:45,270 --> 03:46:51,139
Oh boy, I love that shield. All right, there's two healing things

2611
03:46:51,940 --> 03:46:55,079
All right, you ready? I'm ready

2612
03:46:55,159 --> 03:47:07,770
The guy running that he was not really running to get away. That was very funny

2613
03:47:10,790 --> 03:47:14,149
Yeah, I think certain weapons like actually causes fear and they just flee

2614
03:47:14,790 --> 03:47:16,790
Like if you have a really explosive weapon or something

2615
03:47:17,670 --> 03:47:20,549
You're right. That gun is amazing. Is that purple or blue or any or what is it?

2616
03:47:21,350 --> 03:47:23,909
Uh, this one's a purple but you'll get this pretty soon, I think

2617
03:47:29,209 --> 03:47:32,579
Looks cool

2618
03:47:32,579 --> 03:47:43,590
That was very funny

2619
03:47:45,590 --> 03:47:47,190
Wait, that's me

2620
03:47:47,190 --> 03:47:49,209
That's you bud

2621
03:47:49,209 --> 03:47:52,069

2622
03:47:52,069 --> 03:47:54,469
Oh my god. Thank you. It's good to be back. Nice

2623
03:47:55,270 --> 03:48:00,860
nice job

2624
03:48:00,860 --> 03:48:02,860
Yeah, this this difficulty feels

2625
03:48:03,020 --> 03:48:04,790
so much more like

2626
03:48:04,790 --> 03:48:06,790
uh intense

2627
03:48:06,790 --> 03:48:09,610
Somebody just called me washed up

2628
03:48:10,569 --> 03:48:14,329
What warranted and that person permanently jokes on them ogren's don't wash

2629
03:48:15,290 --> 03:48:16,809
true

2630
03:48:16,809 --> 03:48:25,590
More like unwashed up

2631
03:48:25,590 --> 03:48:27,590
Is there like a class that can heal?

2632
03:48:28,629 --> 03:48:33,860
No, it'd be fun to just be a little healer, dude

2633
03:48:35,100 --> 03:48:38,379
Get like self-heal stuff kind of as a zealot

2634
03:48:40,180 --> 03:48:42,180
But can't help it

2635
03:48:44,200 --> 03:48:45,799
Yeah, ban ban

2636
03:48:45,799 --> 03:48:48,700
We're doing great

2637
03:48:48,700 --> 03:48:50,069
life

2638
03:48:50,069 --> 03:48:52,629
Mods, can we dox this guy ban him for life?

2639
03:48:53,590 --> 03:48:59,670
Look how chilled this guy is

2640
03:49:00,780 --> 03:49:02,780
Oh my god

2641
03:49:03,579 --> 03:49:06,540
What sort of unfortunate situation occurred that led to this thing?

2642
03:49:10,329 --> 03:49:12,329
Why am I just shooting up here

2643
03:49:13,129 --> 03:49:16,489
I'm so I am so obsessed with how this looks

2644
03:49:18,629 --> 03:49:20,870
All the the game

2645
03:49:21,030 --> 03:49:23,030
Yeah, it's just like it's it's so far away

2646
03:49:23,670 --> 03:49:35,239
It's amazing

2647
03:49:35,239 --> 03:49:37,239
If you needed healing there's healing back there

2648
03:49:38,120 --> 03:49:58,200
Access is unpowered. I guess you don't know a if I say lifetime then it means 15 seconds. Oh my god

2649
03:50:00,200 --> 03:50:02,680
They're just throwing me like a little rag doll

2650
03:50:12,870 --> 03:50:16,069
Oh guys i'm blowing up again get away from me got him

2651
03:50:17,190 --> 03:50:18,709
Wait, oh shit. Oh shit. I'm sorry

2652
03:50:18,709 --> 03:50:20,309
I'm gonna give you a little tip here

2653
03:50:20,309 --> 03:50:25,430
If you're about to blow up save your ultimate if you use your ultimate when you're about to blow up it will discharge it

2654
03:50:26,389 --> 03:50:31,270
Is it for higher difficulties do you blow up easier this was not happening until just now

2655
03:50:31,989 --> 03:50:33,989
Um, did you only just put on that stuff?

2656
03:50:34,309 --> 03:50:36,309
I upgraded it recently

2657
03:50:36,709 --> 03:50:38,709
Like I don't know

2658
03:50:38,790 --> 03:50:44,790
Maybe i'm just paying less attention to it. Yeah, I think enemies are harder to kill so you might just be like i'm so fucking locked in

2659
03:50:45,270 --> 03:50:47,989
Basing it off of how many enemies I kill or something

2660
03:50:49,590 --> 03:50:54,729
Probably gonna happen again. I got like so locked in that I didn't even I was just like sitting here

2661
03:50:54,969 --> 03:50:58,409
The last like 10 straight minutes you just stopped talking to the chatter

2662
03:50:59,450 --> 03:51:04,729
Anything i'm just like i'm just I just I'm just like in my own head here. Just playing the video game you become an ogre

2663
03:51:05,530 --> 03:51:07,530
Yeah, that's what happens to me too

2664
03:51:07,690 --> 03:51:11,370
Yeah, dude when we started playing this like stripping first made chug

2665
03:51:12,250 --> 03:51:16,250
I I don't think you streamed anything else since then right sam like you've just been no just

2666
03:51:16,969 --> 03:51:18,969
chugged

2667
03:51:23,670 --> 03:51:26,790
Simple life like my uh, my wife

2668
03:51:27,989 --> 03:51:29,989
She pointed out that my sentences have become shorter

2669
03:51:32,950 --> 03:51:42,739
Just becoming an ogre everything has to be one syllable all words. Yeah, let's go grab the next one

2670
03:51:44,020 --> 03:51:54,180
Maybe ammo anybody need health. I kind of do i'm gonna put healing down over here. I need it

2671
03:51:57,209 --> 03:51:59,209
What causes the purple build up again?

2672
03:51:59,530 --> 03:52:01,530
going down, uh in certain

2673
03:52:02,010 --> 03:52:06,809
Enemies like dogs do when a mutant grabs you when a dog grabs you any of those kind of things

2674
03:52:08,010 --> 03:52:11,860
foxbusters

2675
03:52:11,860 --> 03:52:13,540
That guy. Oh

2676
03:52:13,540 --> 03:52:15,540
We're good

2677
03:52:19,450 --> 03:52:22,409
I didn't I didn't know that guy was gonna blow up on you. I just saw he was red

2678
03:52:28,860 --> 03:52:31,100
Yeah, i'm a bit of a i'm a bit of a too difficult

2679
03:52:31,899 --> 03:52:34,940
So do do you have that charge move as ogre or do you have something else?

2680
03:52:35,979 --> 03:52:37,979
I have that charge move. Yeah, that's um

2681
03:52:38,459 --> 03:52:44,700
When they add new subclasses that move will be different cool, but mine's like, um, I have an improved version from like my feets

2682
03:52:46,700 --> 03:52:49,639
But you use your bare feet

2683
03:52:50,680 --> 03:52:52,680
You know like the skill you got when you get hit five

2684
03:52:53,559 --> 03:52:54,760
Yeah

2685
03:52:54,760 --> 03:53:00,360
Yeah, so I have one of those at 30 that lets me uh charge twice as far and I can't be interrupted no matter what

2686
03:53:00,680 --> 03:53:01,799
That's cool

2687
03:53:01,799 --> 03:53:11,020
It's like i'm like, yeah, i'm gonna knock down all the big stuff. Oh, come on now they're all in

2688
03:53:22,620 --> 03:53:24,739
This new knife is pretty good

2689
03:53:24,739 --> 03:53:28,260
Oh, I need to try mine

2690
03:53:28,260 --> 03:53:30,520
What the heck is this?

2691
03:53:30,520 --> 03:53:47,159
Oh, it's a circuit breaker. Oh

2692
03:53:48,040 --> 03:53:50,790
I just splattered like a dead

2693
03:53:50,950 --> 03:53:53,909
Um, is that heel stick now I dropped it already

2694
03:53:55,190 --> 03:53:57,500
I got another one if you want

2695
03:53:57,819 --> 03:53:59,260
I saw that uh

2696
03:53:59,260 --> 03:54:06,579
You were pretty low

2697
03:54:06,579 --> 03:54:11,059
Yeah, we're we are gaming right now. I mean you guys want to see this. Oh, yeah big gaming

2698
03:54:14,200 --> 03:54:17,059
Keep getting extremely

2699
03:54:17,059 --> 03:54:19,260
Hi everyone. Sorry

2700
03:54:19,260 --> 03:54:21,260
Oh, no

2701
03:54:25,659 --> 03:54:27,659
Sniper yeah

2702
03:54:30,459 --> 03:54:32,120
Thanks mush

2703
03:54:32,120 --> 03:54:34,739
You're very welcome

2704
03:54:34,979 --> 03:54:38,020
So we get extra money and extra experience for doing it on hard

2705
03:54:38,739 --> 03:54:43,459
Yes, yeah more money more experience and then if you do the modifiers you get even more money and experience

2706
03:54:47,209 --> 03:54:49,209
Why did I do what am I doing?

2707
03:54:49,290 --> 03:54:51,129
I want to be on this side

2708
03:54:51,129 --> 03:54:55,209
Somebody said he keeps doing the great stomp lady noise. Yeah, that's me

2709
03:54:56,170 --> 03:54:58,170
Oh, that is what that is

2710
03:54:58,809 --> 03:55:00,809
I started doing that like when I was like

2711
03:55:00,870 --> 03:55:06,250
17 I thought the video was so funny. So whenever I got hurt I would make that sound now. It just took second nature

2712
03:55:07,770 --> 03:55:09,770
Whoops, well i'm down here

2713
03:55:10,729 --> 03:55:13,129
That's my marvel script moment, you know

2714
03:55:15,049 --> 03:55:16,250
That hurts

2715
03:55:16,250 --> 03:55:18,489
Just keeps going up and down

2716
03:55:18,489 --> 03:55:20,489
Ow, don't shoot me

2717
03:55:20,649 --> 03:55:22,729
Oh my god, don't shoot me. I'm in trouble

2718
03:55:23,370 --> 03:55:30,870
Oh, i'm in big trouble here. Oh, there's a lot of a lot of shotgunners here. This is the most i've ever seen

2719
03:55:30,870 --> 03:55:32,870
What the fuck?

2720
03:55:33,829 --> 03:55:35,350
What do I do?

2721
03:55:35,350 --> 03:55:39,379
Okay, most of them are dead

2722
03:55:39,540 --> 03:55:41,540
Never not even

2723
03:55:41,700 --> 03:55:46,520
All right. All right. Good job. I'm gonna get inside this guy's mind watch this

2724
03:55:50,629 --> 03:55:52,629
The only way is forward

2725
03:55:53,909 --> 03:56:02,979
Stop does anybody

2726
03:56:03,139 --> 03:56:08,100
I need I need like a I need a little help guys. Stop it

2727
03:56:09,219 --> 03:56:13,639
I need we need a healing station or something

2728
03:56:16,229 --> 03:56:18,229
Oh, no

2729
03:56:19,209 --> 03:56:20,170
Oh

2730
03:56:20,170 --> 03:56:22,090
It's ready out of the way

2731
03:56:22,090 --> 03:56:28,760
Oh, actually, i'm good. Thanks

2732
03:56:28,760 --> 03:56:30,440
Well something in here

2733
03:56:30,440 --> 03:56:32,340
Please be ammo, please be ammo

2734
03:56:32,340 --> 03:56:37,139
Why would there be nothing in a box? Why would you ever close a box lock a box and have nothing inside of it?

2735
03:56:37,860 --> 03:56:41,260
Who put that box here? Why is this box even here?

2736
03:56:42,440 --> 03:56:44,620
Why do you think they're uh, you know

2737
03:56:46,659 --> 03:56:48,659
Something a heretic would do really

2738
03:56:49,700 --> 03:56:51,700
It's not what happened bud. You want to talk about it?

2739
03:56:52,180 --> 03:56:55,780
Well, i'm opening boxes and there's no ammo in in here. We are again

2740
03:56:56,729 --> 03:56:59,979
gosh

2741
03:56:59,979 --> 03:57:03,750
What is there anything in this one?

2742
03:57:03,750 --> 03:57:05,750
There we go. This one's got

2743
03:57:11,459 --> 03:57:14,260
Oh, they have a little like a little team guarding me

2744
03:57:18,899 --> 03:57:24,979
That's anybody need it or can I take it no no, you're good. Oh my god, that is a big one. Ah, oh

2745
03:57:25,940 --> 03:57:30,840
Oh my god, I think that explosion saved me

2746
03:57:34,700 --> 03:57:37,020
That's a lot of health. Look at this. Look at this little captive

2747
03:57:41,319 --> 03:57:43,319
I don't deserve to join the team

2748
03:57:44,120 --> 03:57:47,100
Not until I get some cool swag like our mascot

2749
03:57:48,299 --> 03:57:49,739
Ooh

2750
03:57:49,739 --> 03:57:55,270
Yeah, there's a hill here

2751
03:57:55,270 --> 03:57:59,590
Um, wait, oh these the little three things tell you how many people can use it. I see

2752
03:58:00,389 --> 03:58:01,270
Yeah

2753
03:58:01,270 --> 03:58:02,860
um

2754
03:58:02,860 --> 03:58:07,340
I guess people with purple should get prioritized, right? Yeah, you can grab it. That's it. That's good

2755
03:58:08,379 --> 03:58:09,420
Okay

2756
03:58:09,420 --> 03:58:13,500
I'll take it first

2757
03:58:13,819 --> 03:58:18,899
Yeah, next time you're about to blow up. It's not try using your old uh f

2758
03:58:19,459 --> 03:58:22,739
All right, i'll give it a shot. It should save you

2759
03:58:24,250 --> 03:58:27,379
It's not

2760
03:58:27,540 --> 03:58:29,940
Little snot

2761
03:58:29,940 --> 03:58:31,690
Where are we going?

2762
03:58:31,690 --> 03:58:33,209
Did it go down or up?

2763
03:58:33,209 --> 03:58:36,149
up

2764
03:58:36,149 --> 03:58:38,329
Oh, I got netted

2765
03:58:38,809 --> 03:58:41,049
I can't wreck it. Oh my god. Watch out. There's a big dude

2766
03:58:42,250 --> 03:58:44,250
He's just walking over to snot

2767
03:58:45,450 --> 03:58:49,370
That would did that sound weird that was I have felt headphones in and i'm like really locked in

2768
03:58:49,450 --> 03:58:51,450
I feel like I just sounded very weird

2769
03:58:51,770 --> 03:58:53,770
It was a very natural laugh. Was it though?

2770
03:58:54,489 --> 03:58:55,850
Yeah

2771
03:58:55,850 --> 03:58:57,850
You're having a good time, man

2772
03:58:58,409 --> 03:59:00,709
self-conscious

2773
03:59:01,750 --> 03:59:04,950
That poses a bigger question though, uh when you're aware of your

2774
03:59:04,950 --> 03:59:08,260
Love

2775
03:59:16,020 --> 03:59:18,020
Self-conscious andy

2776
03:59:23,739 --> 03:59:27,979
You know when you have two headphones in and you're really just gaming and you kind of like a speech jamming yourself

2777
03:59:28,780 --> 03:59:32,780
Wait, do you not usually have two headphones in this? I dude I usually

2778
03:59:33,500 --> 03:59:36,139
Right ear only always 100% really 100%

2779
03:59:36,620 --> 03:59:38,620
that's like uh

2780
03:59:39,500 --> 03:59:42,940
Things going on around you that you require the other info or does it just happen?

2781
03:59:43,180 --> 03:59:46,079
I need to be able to hear myself in a natural environment

2782
03:59:47,340 --> 03:59:50,440
and

2783
03:59:50,440 --> 03:59:52,440
Okay, hold on put it back in

2784
03:59:54,819 --> 03:59:59,139
No, i'm kind of with you on that because I had these headphones that were two noise canceling

2785
03:59:59,940 --> 04:00:04,739
And I had to like figure out how to get a live feedback so that I could like think straight

2786
04:00:05,299 --> 04:00:08,280
Yeah, it was weird. It feels like you're like in a sensory deprivation

2787
04:00:09,620 --> 04:00:12,979
Yeah, I know this like the opening but it's not even just the fact that it's

2788
04:00:13,459 --> 04:00:16,420
Covering my ears and the sound in both ears. It's it is

2789
04:00:17,299 --> 04:00:19,299
It's happening right now

2790
04:00:19,620 --> 04:00:21,620
Um, i'm dead

2791
04:00:22,180 --> 04:00:24,180
It's because of the speech jamming

2792
04:00:24,420 --> 04:00:27,190
Okay, this is sniper. Where's the sniper?

2793
04:00:28,069 --> 04:00:32,729
If you're in the corner, you're good. Just stay in the corner. Yeah. Oh what I'll help you one second

2794
04:00:32,729 --> 04:00:34,549
I gotta deal with

2795
04:00:34,549 --> 04:00:41,379
Oh my god, we're coming for you guys. I almost just blew guys

2796
04:00:42,680 --> 04:00:44,680
i'm getting better at managing my uh

2797
04:00:44,760 --> 04:00:49,190
All right. Here you go. Oh, thank you. Come here smush. Let's get you up

2798
04:00:49,750 --> 04:00:50,870

2799
04:00:50,870 --> 04:00:54,340

2800
04:00:54,340 --> 04:00:57,700
Uh smush. Thanks you. Oh good good good

2801
04:00:58,579 --> 04:01:00,659
It's not appreciate it plus one plus one

2802
04:01:01,559 --> 04:01:06,200
Uh smush says that he's very grateful for all of your contributions

2803
04:01:07,399 --> 04:01:09,719
All right, maybe just do a voice, you know, you don't have to

2804
04:01:10,440 --> 04:01:12,440
freaking like i think

2805
04:01:13,559 --> 04:01:16,520
I think my computer just crashed my whole computer

2806
04:01:17,879 --> 04:01:19,879
He's walking into the wall

2807
04:01:19,879 --> 04:01:22,120
Is am I live? Oh my god

2808
04:01:23,000 --> 04:01:28,440
Oh shit the lore behind this. Why did he just disappear the warp took him am I live still?

2809
04:01:29,530 --> 04:01:30,969
It yeah

2810
04:01:30,969 --> 04:01:36,569
There's a crash that you can rejoin. Oh, okay. I don't think it shuts off your obs, but it does stutter for a second

2811
04:01:36,649 --> 04:01:38,889
Oh, okay. All right. I'm coming. We've had that happen

2812
04:01:39,530 --> 04:01:44,309
Dude, literally all my windows turned off at the same time too. It was weird now. We have darlin

2813
04:01:44,870 --> 04:01:56,020
I'm coming. At least I think i'm on my way if I just open the game. I'll put me right back in

2814
04:01:56,979 --> 04:02:04,700
Yeah, yeah. Oh cool. All right. Good. Let's go

2815
04:02:08,969 --> 04:02:09,930
Just waiting here

2816
04:02:09,930 --> 04:02:17,659
Yeah, no, you guys are good. Keep keep going. I'm joined. You don't see darlin's giving me a dirty look cool level design

2817
04:02:19,459 --> 04:02:21,459
We did this level once already. It's wednesday

2818
04:02:24,549 --> 04:02:26,549
But anyways, i'm having a

2819
04:02:27,030 --> 04:02:30,229
A speech jammer going on in both ears. That's why I always have to be able to hear

2820
04:02:31,110 --> 04:02:33,110
myself in reality

2821
04:02:33,430 --> 04:02:34,549
without any

2822
04:02:34,549 --> 04:02:39,719
Um, like filter on it. So, you know what that might help me. You have a filter on usually

2823
04:02:40,280 --> 04:02:43,239
Well, what I mean by filter is i'm hearing my voice

2824
04:02:43,799 --> 04:02:46,200
with a little bit of um,

2825
04:02:46,760 --> 04:02:52,360
Like dilution like diluted because i'm not getting my actual voice. I have headphones in both ears

2826
04:02:52,920 --> 04:02:59,340
Does that make sense? Yeah, you're hearing a muted version. Yeah, and it just messes with me so bad

2827
04:03:02,620 --> 04:03:06,700
something that I've never actually heard my voice when I try to start talking i'll be like

2828
04:03:07,899 --> 04:03:13,989
Like repeating myself when i'm trying to start talking maybe that's what it is. Maybe I have like a speech jammer thing going on

2829
04:03:15,909 --> 04:03:18,229
Yeah, putting one headphone in usually works

2830
04:03:19,030 --> 04:03:20,549
but it just

2831
04:03:20,549 --> 04:03:23,350
If there's any positional audio at all, you just don't get it

2832
04:03:23,989 --> 04:03:26,870
I have streamed before where I had the left earphone out

2833
04:03:26,870 --> 04:03:32,409
I usually do the left earphone out always permanently and I will not hear something coming down the left hall

2834
04:03:33,340 --> 04:03:37,100
And i'll turn and get hit by it and people will be like, how did you not know that was coming?

2835
04:03:37,739 --> 04:03:44,299
Like well because I physically don't have any knowledge into your into your right ear. Just put them both in the right ear

2836
04:03:44,379 --> 04:03:46,379
Squeeze both headphones into one ear

2837
04:03:46,780 --> 04:03:48,780
So you still get the visual cues

2838
04:03:49,100 --> 04:03:51,100
That's actually really funny

2839
04:03:51,559 --> 04:04:01,110
All right, i'm back. Oh wait, I heard that little the flamethrower guy

2840
04:04:02,229 --> 04:04:05,989
Yeah, right a little bunsen burning just go mono in one ear

2841
04:04:07,430 --> 04:04:10,069
I don't think you could even set it up that way. Can you even do that?

2842
04:04:12,840 --> 04:04:18,870
I think maybe I should try it. Yeah, because if you're if you're

2843
04:04:23,739 --> 04:04:27,100
I hope I get credit for beating the mission, right?

2844
04:04:28,059 --> 04:04:36,709
Yeah, you'll get credit

2845
04:04:36,709 --> 04:04:38,709
Back you tentacle beat. Ow

2846
04:04:39,430 --> 04:04:55,059
You guys see ammo could use it. Oh, I have a box I can put down. Ooh

2847
04:04:59,110 --> 04:05:02,629
Yeah, if you want to get at the stairs once we get this growth

2848
04:05:05,190 --> 04:05:07,909
I think i'm gonna train myself to deal with loud noises

2849
04:05:07,909 --> 04:05:11,909
I'm gonna start putting a distortion effect on my computer and turning it up to like 300

2850
04:05:13,670 --> 04:05:15,670
Yeah, it's like while you're watching tv

2851
04:05:16,149 --> 04:05:20,389
Yeah, any particular, you know end game for that or just to make myself stronger

2852
04:05:20,950 --> 04:05:23,670
Oh cool, you can do you can do sub alerts. They're just screaming you

2853
04:05:24,389 --> 04:05:26,389
Yeah, tell you enough to it

2854
04:05:27,030 --> 04:05:34,010
I bet there's no, uh downsides to that either. Yeah, there's no way you'd develop like

2855
04:05:34,649 --> 04:05:37,049
Some canon tonight is behavioral induced

2856
04:05:38,409 --> 04:05:41,850
It's like uh taking a little bit of poison every day to become immune dude

2857
04:05:41,850 --> 04:05:46,809
I actually blew out my left eardrum when I was sick like a couple of years ago

2858
04:05:48,409 --> 04:05:50,409
I blew my nose too hard

2859
04:05:50,409 --> 04:05:53,610
And it was like boom and I could feel it and it hurt

2860
04:05:54,329 --> 04:05:56,329
And I you know, this is for real

2861
04:05:56,969 --> 04:05:58,010
and now

2862
04:05:58,010 --> 04:06:03,530
Uh, now I have like a little tiny ear ringing in my left ear. Oh, it's horrible. Yeah, it sucks

2863
04:06:04,010 --> 04:06:07,530
It's not that bad. It's just have to be in a dead silent room

2864
04:06:08,090 --> 04:06:10,170
With no sound effects, but I I hear it

2865
04:06:11,049 --> 04:06:13,500
It's annoying

2866
04:06:13,500 --> 04:06:16,139
I feel like you think you could like blow it back, you know

2867
04:06:16,940 --> 04:06:18,940
Yeah, like go the other way. Yeah

2868
04:06:19,260 --> 04:06:22,700
I bet we could put you in a big microwave for a minute and it might fix some problems

2869
04:06:24,139 --> 04:06:29,579
Not even like a minute like micro dosing a microwave like put you in there for like a second another second

2870
04:06:31,500 --> 04:06:33,500
You grow immune to radiation

2871
04:06:33,899 --> 04:06:35,899
Yeah, that's how you could become immune

2872
04:06:36,139 --> 04:06:38,620
Yeah, that's what uh the hope did right? It is important

2873
04:06:39,500 --> 04:06:44,440
The chopper is full of really cool great ideas. He takes off himself in a microwave

2874
04:06:45,399 --> 04:06:48,440
He tick talks

2875
04:06:48,440 --> 04:06:50,280
Keep yawning

2876
04:06:50,280 --> 04:06:54,360
Uh back then I went to the I actually went to like an ent about it and

2877
04:06:55,620 --> 04:06:57,780
It's kind of weird because they were just like, yeah

2878
04:06:58,579 --> 04:06:59,940
That's it

2879
04:06:59,940 --> 04:07:01,540
Your ears are gonna ring

2880
04:07:01,540 --> 04:07:03,540
Just like is there anything I can do about it?

2881
04:07:03,780 --> 04:07:05,059
No

2882
04:07:05,059 --> 04:07:07,940
Oh, I paid for this. Okay, I paid for this advice

2883
04:07:08,659 --> 04:07:11,479
Well, they look they checked

2884
04:07:11,479 --> 04:07:14,920
There was no like real damage to my ear, but it was just like yeah, it's just the way it is

2885
04:07:15,639 --> 04:07:19,610
Like okay

2886
04:07:19,610 --> 04:07:22,889
Listen, you let me give you medical advice and I think we could probably get that here

2887
04:07:30,549 --> 04:07:32,549
There was this uh supplement

2888
04:07:33,270 --> 04:07:36,469
That had I forget what the actual supplement was but it sometimes

2889
04:07:37,030 --> 04:07:40,469
Maybe works for some people, but I don't know if there's even any evidence that it works

2890
04:07:41,430 --> 04:07:45,350
Um, what's it called? I got a specific name like an herb

2891
04:07:46,889 --> 04:07:52,010
All right. Oh, wow. Yeah, just eat extra just put oregano on your pizza and it'll be better

2892
04:07:52,729 --> 04:07:55,959
I just got hurt a lot

2893
04:07:55,959 --> 04:08:03,799
Oh my god, it's like an amino acid or something. I figure what it was

2894
04:08:04,520 --> 04:08:08,379
You just saved my life

2895
04:08:08,379 --> 04:08:11,989
Hey anytime

2896
04:08:11,989 --> 04:08:14,309
You guys look like you need a med kit

2897
04:08:15,909 --> 04:08:17,909
I could use I could use a med kit

2898
04:08:20,979 --> 04:08:25,000
Wait, there's a skull and wait

2899
04:08:25,000 --> 04:08:29,479
Is this a severie or what are we sharing it or are you gonna guys gonna drink most of it?

2900
04:08:29,479 --> 04:08:33,719
Because we I we and chug literally only got like a one sniff of that

2901
04:08:34,280 --> 04:08:38,309
I think like maybe there's a finite amount of healing it can do because we just yeah there is

2902
04:08:38,629 --> 04:08:41,350
Oh cool. He started doing any character. He's like, I can't

2903
04:08:44,299 --> 04:08:46,299
He takes over

04:08:52,659 --> 04:08:58,500
Oh wait smush I got a thing for you to do you do what should I do over here? Yep. Do you have any grenades? Um, no

Grenade

2906
04:09:12,809 --> 04:09:15,850
If you throw a grenade at the eyeball, really

2907
04:09:20,489 --> 04:09:29,620
They don't want me to stand up, um, what's happening to me? What was that?

2908
04:09:31,459 --> 04:09:33,459
That was very weird

2909
04:09:39,959 --> 04:09:44,059
You did it there's more than that

2910
04:09:52,340 --> 04:09:56,760
Oh shit

Get you access to the beta game comes out on the 30th as you see pre-order beta test november 17th and 29th

2954
04:13:50,010 --> 04:13:52,190
Game releases in full on the 30th

2955
04:13:52,270 --> 04:13:55,819
Seems like they are they're working pretty much double time here

2956
04:13:56,299 --> 04:14:01,260
Uh, it seems like to get some stability patches. I think and some stuff ready for the actual launch

2957
04:14:02,110 --> 04:14:04,860
So I will definitely be playing this again

2958
04:14:05,340 --> 04:14:07,500
And we'll go from there, but it's been a blast

2959
04:14:08,409 --> 04:14:16,000
Uh, let's keep going. We'll do one more. This should be a level where you go get slimed like nickelodeon

2960
04:14:18,430 --> 04:14:23,739
They put you in a big chair. Is there a map we haven't done yet. Yes

2961
04:14:29,260 --> 04:14:32,540
this one

2962
04:14:32,540 --> 04:14:34,540
this one is

2963
04:14:34,700 --> 04:14:37,500
rank three lights out and scriptures

2964
04:14:38,459 --> 04:14:40,540
so

2965
04:14:40,540 --> 04:14:44,459
So pretend the scriptures isn't that because you're not going to find them in the dark. Yeah in the dark

2966
04:14:46,450 --> 04:14:49,809
I've got quite the keen eye. Let's do lights out. I think we can do it

2967
04:14:50,829 --> 04:14:53,389
You want to do lights out? All right, let's do lights out

2968
04:14:55,520 --> 04:14:59,340
Uh also, let me clarify that when I say working double time

2969
04:14:59,340 --> 04:15:01,340
I don't I just mean that they're like

2970
04:15:01,340 --> 04:15:05,579
Dedicated to making sure the launch is good. I think they already have plans for like patches and stuff. So

2971
04:15:06,139 --> 04:15:11,469
Uh, I don't mean like oh they're working triple time or something. So I want to clear that up

2972
04:15:12,590 --> 04:15:24,239
It's called a trauma force staff. Oh, that's kind of sad. What do you need flashlights if it's dark? How are we gonna see?

2973
04:15:24,879 --> 04:15:32,639
Yeah, can do the do the arbons not ever get a flashlight. That's so weird. You can't just use your flame up

2974
04:15:33,760 --> 04:15:38,000
I don't know if the flames give off light. I think they might just be listen to what you just said

2975
04:15:38,479 --> 04:15:44,159
Yeah, but you know video game limitations and all that man that big bright thing coming out of your gun

2976
04:15:44,959 --> 04:15:48,479
It doesn't yeah, it doesn't seem to damage. Yeah, I can try it

2977
04:15:49,569 --> 04:15:54,129
But if it doesn't work, then i'm letting the way with holy fire. It's gonna be a little difficult

2978
04:15:56,879 --> 04:16:02,420
Okay, are there any new any new weapons? Did it tell you that you unlocked any when you love it up?

2979
04:16:03,180 --> 04:16:10,500
I yeah, I did. Let me see if I can upgrade one. Oh my god. I can afford pants

2980
04:16:11,459 --> 04:16:13,459
No, I shouldn't though

2981
04:16:14,100 --> 04:16:29,540
Also wait three minutes for a different mission. Oh, yeah, the weapon shop upgrades in three minutes, too. It refreshes my service

2982
04:16:30,659 --> 04:16:34,819
You want to just chill for a couple minutes and just redo all this? Okay. Okay. Sure

2983
04:16:36,780 --> 04:16:38,780
Want to take a look at this anyways?

2984
04:16:39,100 --> 04:16:46,350
Did I get any

2985
04:16:46,350 --> 04:16:49,709
I've done multiple missions now and I still haven't gotten this blue currency

2986
04:16:52,780 --> 04:16:55,180
in the shrine of all my mama's nasha

2987
04:16:56,139 --> 04:16:59,229
They they look like little squares in the level

2988
04:17:00,590 --> 04:17:05,149
This club I the only the reason why i'm not trying to buy it is because it was what I started with

2989
04:17:06,030 --> 04:17:08,819
But that's not how this works

2990
04:17:08,819 --> 04:17:12,500
Just because the you started with the default weapon does not mean oh, yeah, that's the default weapon

2991
04:17:12,500 --> 04:17:19,489
You don't want that thing. It's just a weapon. Should I get it? Yeah, so you can get like a really good club leader

2992
04:17:19,969 --> 04:17:27,309
What do you think the the way the game determines the gear you get in the shop is it takes the

2993
04:17:27,709 --> 04:17:30,750
Highest level piece of gear in your bag or on your person

2994
04:17:31,739 --> 04:17:35,260
So if you buy something even if you don't want to use it if it's like a big upgrade

2995
04:17:35,420 --> 04:17:40,299
It means that when your shop refreshes next time you'll have like better stuff in there. Oh, okay

2996
04:17:40,620 --> 04:17:48,510
That's good to know. Well, I don't know. I have enough money. You can also sell old stuff

2997
04:17:48,670 --> 04:17:50,670
I don't know if you've done that but if you

2998
04:17:50,670 --> 04:17:51,790
That's right

2999
04:17:51,790 --> 04:17:56,350
Press i and then hover over your items you can hold x to sell them and that's easy cash

3000
04:17:57,309 --> 04:18:04,899
That's actually a great I don't want to sell everything but just the stuff I probably won't use yeah, just like your old stuff

3001
04:18:07,629 --> 04:18:14,500
Is it bad to sell greens? No. No. No, I'll just sell get more based on the rarity too

3002
04:18:26,340 --> 04:18:28,100
one minute remaining

3003
04:18:28,100 --> 04:18:33,920
See we got up at 10k

3004
04:18:44,270 --> 04:18:46,059
Shouldn't have sold

3005
04:18:46,059 --> 04:19:06,190
Yeah, it's all right though. Watch me regret not buying this right now. It's gonna be all greens. It's been fun, but I can go over

3006
04:19:06,989 --> 04:19:08,989
Um, let's go over what's going on next week

3007
04:19:09,979 --> 04:19:16,319
I will be back on tuesday. That's something interesting going on on tuesday

3008
04:19:16,959 --> 04:19:18,719
i'm gonna be playing

3009
04:19:18,719 --> 04:19:26,909
Something I don't want to spoil it but uh stir maybe somebody else. I don't want to spoil it. I don't want to spoil it

3010
04:19:27,469 --> 04:19:30,110
I'm playing a fun game on the 29th

3011
04:19:31,520 --> 04:19:32,399
uh

3012
04:19:32,399 --> 04:19:34,399
We'll be playing this again on launch

3013
04:19:34,799 --> 04:19:38,340
So i'm actually happy about that because that's gonna be a lot of fun because they think the game's really good

3014
04:19:39,309 --> 04:19:41,309
and then on the first something

3015
04:19:41,889 --> 04:19:43,250
very

3016
04:19:43,250 --> 04:19:50,049
Interesting and unusual is happening not on my stream. You'll you'll hear about it very soon

3017
04:19:50,209 --> 04:19:53,229
So that should be fun, too

3018
04:19:53,229 --> 04:20:15,680
That's the plan for next week. Did did stir already talk about it? Did stir talk about it? Yeah. Oh, okay

3019
04:20:18,479 --> 04:20:20,399
I had the hiccups for

3020
04:20:20,399 --> 04:20:24,479
Like an hour straight the other day and I was almost in tears by the end of that hour

3021
04:20:24,879 --> 04:20:32,430
I don't think you can survive a full year. I'm telling you no no mortal man. That's too much

3022
04:20:36,049 --> 04:20:39,040
Okay, is this better?

3023
04:20:39,040 --> 04:20:45,379
Hello. Hello. Sorry. I was muted just you think you could survive a whole year of hiccuping germa

3024
04:20:48,319 --> 04:20:49,920
How often does it happen?

3025
04:20:49,920 --> 04:20:56,750
Like as on on the normal it's like every having hiccups every like 30 seconds to minute two minutes. Yeah

3026
04:20:58,379 --> 04:21:03,180
Yeah, no, no, I don't think so. That's what i'm saying people keep saying they could survive it

3027
04:21:03,579 --> 04:21:08,690
Is the money involved? Yeah, you you would get a sum of money, but that's not too important

3028
04:21:08,850 --> 04:21:12,739
Well, now it is very important. How much I don't know 100 a million dollars

3029
04:21:12,979 --> 04:21:15,139
I was gonna say a hundred away a hundred dollars

3030
04:21:17,219 --> 04:21:23,250
For a hundred million dollars, I think the answer is yes, but your mile your life might be at stake

3031
04:21:24,030 --> 04:21:25,870
No, it would just be really annoying for a year

3032
04:21:25,870 --> 04:21:30,829
But then you have a hundred million dollars for the rest of your life. Think about the anatomy of the human

3033
04:21:30,829 --> 04:21:33,709
I don't know about you guys, but sometimes my hiccups like hurt really bad

3034
04:21:33,790 --> 04:21:35,069
Yeah, that's what i'm saying

3035
04:21:35,069 --> 04:21:41,790
Like you you get the hiccups after like dude after two days of hiccuping straight even in your sleep

3036
04:21:42,030 --> 04:21:46,510
You're gonna be like you're gonna be on your knees like begging for someone to just like cancel the deal

3037
04:21:46,909 --> 04:21:49,229
You wouldn't be able to sleep. You'd like die of sleep deprivation

3038
04:21:49,870 --> 04:21:54,239
Well, do you but hold on but do you hiccup in do you hiccup in your sleep?

3039
04:21:54,719 --> 04:22:02,770
Yeah, it'll be a year straight of just hiccupping. So you wouldn't you would wake up every that wouldn't make any sense

3040
04:22:02,770 --> 04:22:08,540
You wouldn't be able to that's why I say it's considerate carefully. Criken doesn't want to think about it

3041
04:22:08,860 --> 04:22:14,190
He just thinks he can do it. You you would sign yourself up and you would just be in agony

3042
04:22:15,899 --> 04:22:18,459
So all the lights out ones just went away and turned into endless horde

3043
04:22:18,540 --> 04:22:25,760
So just back in the endless horde zone great for new mission

3044
04:22:25,760 --> 04:22:30,270
I don't think we've done this your body would get used to it

3045
04:22:30,270 --> 04:22:34,190
I think your body I think it probably would I don't know if it would happen in your rem sleep

3046
04:22:34,350 --> 04:22:37,469
I don't think it's possible your body like shuts down a bunch of features, doesn't it?

3047
04:22:37,709 --> 04:22:43,170
Yeah, but you also accepted a curse man. I don't think the curse cares about you your body's features

3048
04:22:43,569 --> 04:22:51,200
That's true. You're hiccupping every every 30 seconds for a year. I wonder if that muscle would get pretty buff

3049
04:22:51,760 --> 04:22:57,520
Oh, you would be so buff like that hiccup muscle. I wonder if you could like medically induce sleep though just hiccup through it

3050
04:22:57,920 --> 04:23:03,180
Yeah, definitely. You get used to it. I think your body would adapt going to crypto sleep for a year

3051
04:23:03,940 --> 04:23:07,139
Yeah, this is uh, this is my last one. Are you guys gonna keep playing after this?

3052
04:23:08,379 --> 04:23:13,840
I think we'll play a little more at least I will uh, I know I think tomato might be joining us

3053
04:23:15,280 --> 04:23:17,280
I don't know if i'm gonna play pizza just got here

3054
04:23:18,079 --> 04:23:22,989
Pizza if you think you're still going i'll uh, i'll raid you after it's over. Thanks

3055
04:23:23,389 --> 04:23:28,420
I mean you can just eat the pizza while playing try work like germa did remember it was good to eat on stream

3056
04:23:28,420 --> 04:23:30,420
What if I get the hiccups?

3057
04:23:35,040 --> 04:23:37,040
All right, let's make it a good one

3058
04:23:43,299 --> 04:23:45,299
Is that my character talking

3059
04:23:45,379 --> 04:23:46,420
Yes

3060
04:23:46,420 --> 04:23:48,500
I told you actually I picked the one that's sort of

3061
04:23:49,459 --> 04:23:54,579
You can see how I was mistaken for rocko the rock and roll frown. I just want like a score a mad scientist

3062
04:23:54,899 --> 04:23:59,059
I want four of the character that you're playing to all harmonize at the same time

3063
04:24:00,020 --> 04:24:03,229
Yeah, you can have multiple people all have the same voice

3064
04:24:03,790 --> 04:24:05,790
And just oh, yeah

3065
04:24:06,030 --> 04:24:08,270
Wait, so this big dude can have that little tiny voice

3066
04:24:08,829 --> 04:24:10,829
Uh, no, it it's classic

3067
04:24:12,350 --> 04:24:14,350
Didn't lie you misunderstood me

3068
04:24:15,229 --> 04:24:27,489
Blue this knife is good

3069
04:24:27,489 --> 04:24:29,489
What should I eat tonight? What do you guys think?

3070
04:24:29,729 --> 04:24:31,729
Any recommendations yesterday?

3071
04:24:32,610 --> 04:24:33,889
Uh

3072
04:24:33,889 --> 04:24:35,489
Thanksgiving dinner

3073
04:24:36,590 --> 04:24:42,190
Come on you got you you got enough to eat for like three or four days. I could just eat that some mayonnaise sandwiches

3074
04:24:43,739 --> 04:24:46,299
And do you want something light something?

3075
04:24:46,940 --> 04:24:53,260
The opposite of thanksgiving or you want to keep riding the thanksgiving train? I actually might just ride the thanksgiving wave. I think

3076
04:24:54,219 --> 04:25:00,340
But if it wasn't that then what what do you think?

3077
04:25:02,110 --> 04:25:06,430
If it wasn't that yeah, what are you guys favorite foods? Like yeah, what do you guys would say?

3078
04:25:07,069 --> 04:25:11,790
I feel like maybe a nice pasta dish would be like the opposite of a thanksgiving

3079
04:25:12,750 --> 04:25:14,750
I like it. It's a comfy one. Yeah

3080
04:25:16,110 --> 04:25:22,559
You know, i'll be honest ever since we went to that, uh chicken katsu place in vegas

3081
04:25:22,959 --> 04:25:27,600
I started ordering chicken katsu because it was so fucking good. I've been chasing the high ever since

3082
04:25:28,239 --> 04:25:30,239
Yeah, it's just it's just unbeatable

3083
04:25:30,559 --> 04:25:33,360
It was so good. It's a it's like a japanese curry

3084
04:25:33,920 --> 04:25:36,750
like breaded chicken

3085
04:25:36,750 --> 04:25:42,370
But it's like this kind of deep spice unlike other curries. It's a really interesting. Yeah, it is fantastic

3086
04:25:44,190 --> 04:25:46,190
That's actually not a bad idea

3087
04:25:46,270 --> 04:25:49,629
Is it like my favorite places to go in la was coca?

3088
04:25:50,430 --> 04:25:52,430
The curry was so good. Oh, I don't know if i've been there

3089
04:25:53,149 --> 04:25:54,110
What?

3090
04:25:54,110 --> 04:25:56,110
Did we go there together? Where's the sniper?

3091
04:25:56,829 --> 04:25:59,709
We must have we went one time for like ramen. I remember

3092
04:26:00,350 --> 04:26:02,909
You haven't been I don't know if you live there

3093
04:26:03,709 --> 04:26:07,950
Yeah, that was a big city just tell me to eat shit it can't be that big what do I do

3094
04:26:09,729 --> 04:26:11,649
Get some ammo pal

3095
04:26:11,649 --> 04:26:13,649
I got a healing crate

3096
04:26:14,049 --> 04:26:21,600
Well, next time you go out to eat, you know where to go

3097
04:26:22,079 --> 04:26:26,079
Cocoa. Oh shit. I'm having like with you guys. I'm just being a big line of gunmen

3098
04:26:26,879 --> 04:26:29,700
I hear a dog

3099
04:26:32,319 --> 04:26:34,350
Thank goodness

3100
04:26:34,350 --> 04:26:42,850
I would have probably died. I've been to sugarfish. Yeah sugarfish is

3101
04:26:43,489 --> 04:26:44,610
amazing

3102
04:26:44,610 --> 04:26:46,610
There's a staple out here

3103
04:26:48,350 --> 04:26:53,709

3104
04:26:54,510 --> 04:26:56,670
Yeah, it's usually places. It's really high quality

3105
04:27:00,540 --> 04:27:02,540
You know, I have not had sushi in a long time

Do you ever come here come here?

3163
04:31:27,440 --> 04:31:29,040
That was scabby

There's where all those guys are coming from. That's the way

3173
04:32:16,540 --> 04:32:18,540
I'm gonna try to deal with these guys first

3174
04:32:22,479 --> 04:32:25,489
These guys aren't playing around

3175
04:32:25,489 --> 04:32:27,969
That's what happens when you play the game on fucking hard kid. All right

3176
04:32:28,690 --> 04:32:31,250
It's not straight down that corridor just all the way to the end

3177
04:32:32,610 --> 04:32:37,790
On it. Oh my god. I've been

3178
04:32:41,149 --> 04:32:43,149
Oh my god, he's dying we

3179
04:32:43,389 --> 04:32:45,549
It's okay. It's just one enemy. I can handle them

3180
04:32:46,510 --> 04:32:50,219
I just saw you miss four times. Yeah, it was actually more like eight

3181
04:32:51,020 --> 04:32:53,020
You just happened to come in at the last four

3182
04:32:53,739 --> 04:32:58,780
All right, a hound dog has found me. Oh, no, he's gonna die. I got i'm fine guys. I'm fine

3183
04:32:58,860 --> 04:33:01,819
Do you have people running into that room you guys are in by the way?

3184
04:33:03,579 --> 04:33:06,400
We're never leaving this place

3185
04:33:10,159 --> 04:33:17,220
Oh my god, I almost blew myself up where are they even coming from that's what i'm saying. There's too many people in these places

3186
04:33:18,930 --> 04:33:22,209
Wait, how many people live in a hive city again? Do you know 90 billion?

3187
04:33:23,090 --> 04:33:26,389
90 billion 90 around in a billion

3188
04:33:31,250 --> 04:33:33,409
And it has 90 billion what happened

3189
04:33:36,580 --> 04:33:40,340
Because i'm panicking there's like too much shit going on 10. All right, we're good

3190
04:33:42,419 --> 04:33:46,580
I have a heal. I'm not I don't think we need it right now though, right? I think we're okay. It's 11 I guess

3191
04:33:52,400 --> 04:33:56,799
dog

3192
04:33:56,799 --> 04:33:58,799
This shit is just exploding

3193
04:33:59,220 --> 04:34:01,619
Yeah, so the the current augment we have is endless horde

3194
04:34:02,500 --> 04:34:04,659
Oh, that's what's going on. Okay

3195
04:34:09,040 --> 04:34:11,840
Oh that guy goes yeah, he's got the slime

3196
04:34:12,479 --> 04:34:17,439
Does a slime is that like a boomer where it sucks up the I mean it attracts the horde?

3197
04:34:18,240 --> 04:34:21,360
Uh, no, no, they just hurt he's just out here to us

3198
04:34:22,560 --> 04:34:24,240
Thank goodness

3199
04:34:24,240 --> 04:34:26,240
Why did they call it the boomer? Huh?

3200
04:34:26,319 --> 04:34:29,520
Did you guys boom?

3201
04:34:29,520 --> 04:34:31,520
It was probably the most brilliant name

3202
04:34:31,919 --> 04:34:33,439
in gaming history

3203
04:34:33,439 --> 04:34:35,869
They probably named it before like the boomer stuff

3204
04:34:37,180 --> 04:34:38,619
Kind of come on

3205
04:34:38,619 --> 04:34:40,700
Oh before like okay boomer. Yeah

3206
04:34:42,000 --> 04:34:46,959
It would have been if they capitalized on that though and had like a bubble flossing or something. Oh, yeah

3207
04:34:47,360 --> 04:34:52,639
They were a trillion dollars. Oh, I didn't even know what that was. Sorry without even having a hiccup for a year

3208
04:34:54,779 --> 04:34:57,150
That little oh

3209
04:34:57,389 --> 04:35:02,590
There was a little a little bit of fire. Wait. Oh, you're here with me. You saw it. I did it actually accidentally

3210
04:35:02,990 --> 04:35:06,270
What are those goofballs doing over there? Oh, right. Sorry

3211
04:35:07,790 --> 04:35:15,380
Just having a little conversation. Where the hell are we don't say that because then they think we're bad gamers

3212
04:35:18,020 --> 04:35:20,900
Oh here. Uh, germa don't forget to buff with this thing

3213
04:35:21,860 --> 04:35:23,860
Fight my fucking heart out over here

3214
04:35:24,819 --> 04:35:28,819
Fuck tons of them. Yeah, there's a lot of them over here guys. We're holding them off. They're trying to get to you

3215
04:35:29,540 --> 04:35:31,299
Drop down that big hole

3216
04:35:31,299 --> 04:35:38,639
Thanks

3217
04:35:38,639 --> 04:35:40,639
Hey, we did most of the heavy lifting back there

3218
04:35:43,150 --> 04:35:45,150
Just glad you guys are all right, you know

3219
04:35:46,939 --> 04:35:48,540
it's

3220
04:35:48,540 --> 04:35:53,380
Could I push one of the like, uh, one of the special infected off the map?

3221
04:35:54,900 --> 04:35:56,900
Rehealing for everyone

3222
04:35:59,540 --> 04:36:09,540
I guess get topped off right that reason not to yeah. All right

3223
04:36:12,900 --> 04:36:19,619
That guy really you got that guy it goes running up to you and just quietly put up your knife like

3224
04:36:23,700 --> 04:36:30,900
Oh my god, what the fuck right after we did what what happened he's gonna hurt me

3225
04:36:34,979 --> 04:36:41,700
Fucked on a fucking compressed air container and flew. I'm stuck. I'm dead. I'm gone forever

3226
04:36:42,819 --> 04:36:44,419
I can't move

3227
04:36:44,419 --> 04:36:47,439
I'm dead

3228
04:36:47,439 --> 04:36:53,810
Can you break the thing? What happened? Oh he he must I think the boss knocked me back. I was stuck on pixels

3229
04:36:54,610 --> 04:36:56,610
It's up to you to find this

3230
04:36:58,380 --> 04:37:09,139
He can handle this i've been farming the boston accent a little first might be the best one

3231
04:37:12,700 --> 04:37:14,540
Oh god

3232
04:37:14,540 --> 04:37:16,939
This does not look good. Did we just lose?

3233
04:37:18,619 --> 04:37:20,619
Bounce me over

3234
04:37:22,849 --> 04:37:25,150
Oh, that's

3235
04:37:25,150 --> 04:37:28,479
That's the end

3236
04:37:29,040 --> 04:37:32,369
Fucking muck

3237
04:37:32,529 --> 04:37:36,689
Yeah, I went I went off the whole map it actually launched me into the sky box i'm not kidding

3238
04:37:36,689 --> 04:37:39,950
I was dead instantly. Yeah, that

3239
04:37:40,189 --> 04:37:46,909
Could not have done worse. There were like 10 snipers that instantly shot me all at the same time. That's what happened with me

3240
04:37:47,549 --> 04:37:50,110
And it was nothing I could have done

3241
04:37:50,830 --> 04:37:53,919
That's fat

3242
04:37:53,919 --> 04:37:56,930
That was fun

3243
04:37:56,930 --> 04:38:03,200
I did get some more currency. We still get paid for losing a little bit. Yeah, that's good

3244
04:38:03,840 --> 04:38:06,319
Get a portion doesn't just take the whole thing from you

3245
04:38:06,959 --> 04:38:10,450
The payee payment

3246
04:38:10,450 --> 04:38:12,450
