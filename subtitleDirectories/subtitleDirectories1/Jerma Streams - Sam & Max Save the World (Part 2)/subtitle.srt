1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:09,400
He's one minute early. Well, I'm not early. As long as it's in this window. I could have started

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:19,239
about 30 or 40 minutes ago, but I was too busy shit posting in chat. It took too long. I'm sitting

3
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:25,699
there writing all kinds of dumb shit for 30 minutes. So I... I could have started. I just

4
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:33,000
had to get coffee and take out auto and stuff. So I do that to... okay, those of you that are

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,560
like, oh wait, he's been... why, you know, why doesn't the stream start earlier than that? I

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,799
mean it's like four. It's between three and four. What the heck, man? No, I... it's because I am here.

7
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,520
I just like to be a chatter sometimes for like a half an hour. It's kind of fun.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:59,420
I do it all the time. What the heck, man? It's because it's different. I can like hunch over

9
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:07,989
and be like... it's a little different. Stalling? Oh, you're gonna get a big stall today because

10
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:14,359
I've got a fucking story for you. I'm gonna wait till people get the tweet and stuff because

11
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:28,870
this is a big story. Big one. Stalling. Hey, you know, is it a stall? If it's... if you... okay.

12
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,700
If the car stalls out, I understand. But I'm coasting right now. I'm idling. Stalled means

13
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:51,129
the engine turns off. A really big show. What is that? Go get vehicle berry? Fucking vehicle

14
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:57,299
berry. But yeah, today we're gonna... I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We are going to do

15
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:05,349
the rest of season one of Sam and Max, probably. I don't think... unless somebody can correct me

16
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:13,819
here... I don't think this is gonna take more than six to seven hours. Is it? Because we're

17
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:24,699
in the middle of episode three. Three, four, five, six, seven-ish, maybe. I'm just gonna

18
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:29,990
finish it tonight. We're just gonna do it. Depends on how stupid you feel today. I feel

19
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:40,300
pretty intelligent today. Anybody else like that? How many other people here wake up sometimes and

20
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:49,659
they are Albert Einstein? You can do anything. You can solve any problem, any solution, any

21
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:54,139
equation. You can do anything. You're easy to speak. You're easy to talk. You're easy to

22
00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:00,740
move around. Then on some days you wake up and you can... you're like a caveman. It's...

23
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:10,340
seriously, it's 50-50. It's yin and yang with me. He's trying to brag here again.

24
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:19,539
I'm always a caveman. Sometimes I'm a caveman for two straight weeks. Sometimes I get on it and I'm

25
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:23,780
just super on top of everything and I get... I got something to say about that. I got something

26
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,750
to say about that. I'm gonna bring up this. Gonna bring up that. You guys have seen streams

27
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:38,379
before. I'm just like, hey, okay. So, um, this way. Yep. I think... I just died. You know what I mean?

28
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:49,539
I got... it's yin and yang. High energy, low energy. That's what that is. That's what yin and

29
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:57,979
yang is. Except it's not. We make funny haha videos. All right. I think we've stalled for

30
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:04,650
enough time. I think it's time to tell the story. Part two of The Dentist. And the funny

31
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,460
thing about this story is... wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's trash over here. Hold on.

32
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:43,220
Funny thing about this story. It's not a... ow! Funny thing about this story. It's not trash.

33
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,629
It's... I'm moving electronics around. It's not trash. So the funny thing about this story...

34
00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:28,519
Come on! The funny... red skin. Stop it. It's... why won't this work? I'm trying to adjust the white

35
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:33,579
balance. Look, I live in Las Vegas. It's been hot. The sun's been shining. I got a sunburn.

36
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:45,050
Look. See? I'll prove it. See? Look. See? Look at that. See? Anyways. So I'm not the dentist

37
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:54,199
today. I'm not even gonna look over here. I'm minimizing chat. That means minimize.

38
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,560
All right. So listen. Those of you that remember when I said I went to The Dentist

39
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,160
a couple weeks ago, right? So I went to The Dentist a couple weeks ago. And I did part one

40
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,959
of my procedures that I was going to do. Had some x-rays. Had some... had some things done.

41
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:17,610
Came back for part two today. And what did I talk about? What was in The Dentist two weeks

42
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:26,089
ago that I made a big deal about? Uh-huh. There was a television in The Dentist office.

43
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,810
No, not teeth, right? So in this Dentist office, there is a TV with Netflix on it.

44
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,329
Remember I said, oh, I wonder what people watch when they get their teeth done? I made that

45
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:43,610
very specific comment. Anyways, today I'm in The Dentist office. Earlier today. This is like

46
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,649
four hours ago. So I get the remote and I've got some work to do. So I'm gonna be there

47
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:55,449
for like an hour or so, right? Maybe a little bit more. So I go back in the chair

48
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:00,730
and while I'm going back, I'm told, put on whatever you want. And I kind of panicked a little bit.

49
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:08,629
I didn't know what to put on. So I put on something safe. A nature documentary. Again,

50
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:15,029
yes. I panicked again. I do this every time. So I put on a nature documentary and it's the

51
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:20,779
episode. I didn't care what the fucking episode was called. The episode was called Cording.

52
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,420
It was like a BBC documentary. I'm going to describe it. You may have already seen it.

53
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:31,740
So Cording is on the screen. This is just playing. Netflix is just sitting there. Thankfully,

54
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,660
the volume's not turned up very high at all. So I'm in the chair going back and things are

55
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:42,839
normal. And I'm glancing over at this TV every now and then. Remember, Dentist is fucking in

56
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:50,889
my mouth. Like Dentist is in my mouth doing these things. Dentist is in his... Dentist is

57
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:57,670
drilling. No, he's not drilling. Dentist is using tools inside of my mouth. So

58
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:09,639
God damn it. Why? The... I've ruined the whole story. So the Dentist is working in my mouth while

59
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,220
the Netflix documentary is playing. So he's, you know, doing his thing. He's like,

60
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,740
do you have talk? Oh yeah. So let me see this. Let me see. Turn this way, please.

61
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:25,209
I glance over at the TV and there are two turtles having sex on the TV. Just fucking on

62
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:31,850
screen. And I'm like this. And remember, the TV is over here. So I really have to like look

63
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,009
hard and there's two turtles just going at it. And remember, the episode was called Cording.

64
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,940
I'm okay, you know? It doesn't take... Sometimes it's really easy for me to laugh and get into

65
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,179
a laughing fit. But whatever, that's fucking nature. It doesn't matter. He's sitting there,

66
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:51,460
still doing his thing. Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you okay?

67
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,289
You okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. Little do I know that this keeps going.

68
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:03,929
The two turtles are having sex. Another turtle. Another turtle comes from behind the other

69
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:08,409
turtle and starts punching this turtle in the back of the head over and over again.

70
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:20,970
And I'm like... Why? Why is it her? I'm telling you, this is like CIA level training

71
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,769
that I had to go through here to not laugh while the guy was fucking in my mouth doing

72
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:32,039
things. That's not the end of the story. So I'm going like this. And what do I see again

73
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:38,039
while I fucking tear my eyes down? Another turtle shows up. Just what I think. I was

74
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,440
out of the woods here. Another fucking turtle starts to fight the rest of the turtles and

75
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:50,220
one of two of them having sex with each other. It got to a point where I was like...

76
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:56,409
And he's like, are you okay? I'm like, yeah, I just got some water back here in my mouth.

77
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,379
This is just animals having sex on the screen behind him. He didn't even know.

78
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,889
This is at the dentist. And 2020 hindsight. I composed myself completely. But holy shit, man.

79
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:22,179
It was unbelievable. No, he didn't know. He's sitting there going like this and the TV behind

80
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:30,139
him is turtles having sex. It was so elaborate. Tell him you need to change the channel. Well,

81
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:37,740
I... You can't... What am I going to do? Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. I'm the guy that put on

82
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:50,820
the animals having sex. Can I change that? I put it on. We're going to play Sam and Max now.

83
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,789
Speaking of animals, it wasn't that big of a deal until the other turtle started to come

84
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:18,779
and punch the other turtle that was having sex in the head. It was just... It was bizarre.

85
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:35,419
My stand up story. No, this is just me telling a story. I think we're on this one,

86
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:55,899
right? That was Larry David. I knew that that Netflix shit was going to fuck me up.

87
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,960
I was certain when I went there two weeks ago and I saw that the TV was there, I knew there was

88
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:06,600
going to be a problem. I've tried to put on something safe. And here's the worst part

89
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,440
about that. I'll end the story and we'll move on. But here's the worst part about that entire

90
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:18,070
thing. If I had just put on something like Cupcake Wars, I would have cracked and laughed

91
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,860
at that show for some reason. I was able to keep it together during the animals having sex.

92
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,049
Life story, season one, episode five, courtship. There it is. That is the exact

93
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:41,610
episode. Just watch The Power of the Turtles. You tell me... You watch that fucking episode

94
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,610
right now. Just delete... Get out of the stream. Watch that episode right now and you tell me

95
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,809
that if you're in the dentist lying in the chair, you're going to have no problem with that

96
00:12:48,809 --> 00:13:11,860
one. Show it on stream? I can't. Ah, fuck. This is the guy that laughed at fart jokes

97
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:23,940
for an hour. Yeah, but what was I supposed to do with that scenario? I don't know. It's

98
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,820
not something that you are expecting to see, like glaring, pulling your eyeballs down,

99
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:38,539
looking at a TV. All right, so now look at... Don't choose the mating show next time. I don't

100
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:43,820
know. I'm out of coffee but I'm so nervous I keep trying to drink it anyway. It's funny how

101
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,779
stress can reduce you to just a bundle of mindless reflexes. Is that what happened to

102
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:55,399
me? Wouldn't it be wonderful to think so? Do you remember messing up things at the start

103
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:08,470
of the stream? What do you mean? All right, well let me break down what this is. We're in

104
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:15,460
the middle of episode three. So if you're wondering, wait, what the hell's going on?

105
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,080
Why are you... we just jumped right in. It's because this is the middle of the episode. We

106
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,200
are tasked with doing three things. We have to kill Sybil. There's one of them, but we're

107
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,360
not going to do that. That's one of the things we have to do. So we have three tasks

108
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:41,269
that we need to fake, I'm assuming, right? Have you considered the possibility of staging

109
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:45,110
your own deaths to throw the toy mafia off the scent? That would be dishonest.

110
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,070
There's a shitload of turtles. They just don't stop coming over there. They are fighting

111
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:57,909
each other. The truth. You're a real antique, you know that? I mean in a good way. I've

112
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:06,330
always liked antiques. Okay, so we'll be back. We'll be back. I know you will.

113
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,529
You're the only two I can trust. Oh, really? She should consider guilt slinger as her

114
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:18,649
next profession. All right, so is there... I need to be... I need a reminder of something here.

115
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,230
We got the teddy bear box or the thing that can listen.

116
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:35,740
The sixth of them in the narrative. Yeah, dude, it was fucking out of control. Dude,

117
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:43,559
I keep having flashbacks. That's that moment. All right, magnet tokens used. I'm not going

118
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:48,580
to use the gun. We already did that. All right, let's go. Is there like a way I can...

119
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,860
Oh my god, I did it again. It's been like two or three weeks and I tried to leave through

120
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:12,179
the closet again. God damn it. Look, I had a rough day, all right? I will. I'm gonna try.

121
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:24,330
That actually wasn't rough. It was fucking... it was... it was fucking hilarious. But,

122
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:47,399
you know. Let me move this. You guys want face cam today? Okay, that looks all right.

123
00:16:47,399 --> 00:17:06,220
I gotta take up some space over here. Not too big. I don't want to get too... I don't

124
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:19,779
want to get too big here. Okay, I need a bigger face. A bigger face! All right, so,

125
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,660
I really... I really don't know what... where we left off here. There's the casino. This

126
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:36,259
is the casino episode. I have some new items. Let me go just walk around and talk. I have

127
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:41,539
a perfectly symmetrical face. I do not. I do not. Actually, no, I don't. I'm gonna prove it

128
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:48,410
to you right now. So, you see, my face looks like... so, if we take a look at this angle here,

129
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,690
my nose comes down. It actually goes this way. So, my nose actually goes in a completely

130
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:00,250
different direction. So, my nose crosses here. My mouth here goes down, right? So, as you see,

131
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,329
this is a straight out of my face. When we turn this way, the chin is more pronounced here

132
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:10,329
and the nose points over here, right? Sorry, this way. This eye socket is out a little

133
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,089
and when I turn this way, notice how the nose is pointing this way and this eye socket is back

134
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:22,650
and my chin points down a little deeper this way. Some of you have made fun of my face this

135
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,609
way because each day it looks like a banana and it's very rude and very mean, but I think this

136
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:31,690
is my good side. This is... I mean, you could... maybe... it depends. This could be my good

137
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,400
side too. You know, the little deeper set eye there. They're both good sides, I think. They're

138
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,569
just both very different. You don't have a good side. My mother would disagree with you.

139
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:06,230
All right, Sam and Max, where are we going? No, I do not have a symmetrical face at all.

140
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:16,980
A very rocky face. Are you only... are you reading mean comments again? Yeah. I'm sorry,

141
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:24,569
though. Oh, here's a security camera in here, right? So, this is the... this is the security

142
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:45,619
camera. Can I do anything weird with this? Hmm. Someone want to give me a little

143
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:50,420
clue here to get us on the right track? Because it's been a couple weeks. I have no idea what I'm

144
00:19:50,420 --> 00:20:06,759
supposed to do right now. Well, oh, will he actually get... do this for me? I don't know,

145
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:18,839
man. It's your stream. I just... it's been a while. I gotta join the mafia, right?

146
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,329
That camera seems to be bulletproof. If only there were some way to get rid of arbitrary items here

147
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:33,690
in the store. Get rid of items? Irony is a sledgehammer, isn't it? So, do we have to... okay.

148
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:43,079
Shall we, Sean? Let's do... So, something... and what... does it... I can remove something from here.

149
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:52,460
Magnet? Or maybe just put the magnet on it? Does it fuck it all up?

150
00:20:53,019 --> 00:21:13,779
My face cam? I'm gonna turn it off in, like, five minutes anyway. Can I distract him? What else was...

151
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:18,579
what else was... what were the other two tasks? Kill Sybil and then I don't remember what the

152
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:22,740
other two are. Is there, like, a way... well, I think we're getting... there's a new character

153
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:32,740
here. Okay. Not gonna say anything. He's watching us.

154
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:46,380
All right, so... I'd rather keep it to myself. Listening device. Shoot him, he's suspicious. Now,

155
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,640
he's just... he's gonna follow me around. Takes me back to my childhood. I can't go in here.

156
00:21:52,279 --> 00:22:03,210
Should I go back to the casino? Okay, yeah, I need to retrieve the meatball sub,

157
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:11,930
dissuade Bosco, and kill Sybil. Okay. So, let me go back in here and see if...

158
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:23,670
and knowing that now, let me see. So, I have to stop this camera from... hold on.

159
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,460
Can I put anything on here?

160
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,509
Something that the anti-delivery camera does not recognize.

161
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:55,819
It actually is.

162
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,980
He will not sneak past me. Oh, no! The price of paranoia is eternal vigilance. Got it.

163
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:13,900
What if his toy mafia disguise is just a disguise? I gotta see what he's reading.

164
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:22,859
All right, so he's... no, okay. Now, Magneth on the camera. If he's pretending to do the

165
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,220
word jumble, he's with the Knights of Malta. So, I should be able to do something.

166
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:37,500
Suck it up. Out the door. Yeah! Eat pavement, camera!

167
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,180
The society pages must be sculling bones.

168
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:56,220
Got that one. All right, so now I can... now I have to persuade him. Can I put... wait a

169
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,549
minute. Hold on. He's gonna look over and see this. He's gonna freak out.

170
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:04,390
Pretending to read the gardening section. So, it's true. He is toy mafia.

171
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,990
He's gonna know that this was delivered. I hope we don't lose Bosco's friendship over this.

172
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,869
Me neither. He's my second favorite delusional paranoid.

173
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:30,619
Oh no! Oh no! He's coming in! We're done for, y'all! Persuade. I surrender! I surrender!

174
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:40,650
Told you this would happen! I told you he would deliver, and he delivered! I can't believe

175
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,329
that guy! But, are you supposed to drink after the dentist? We'll help you purge this place

176
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:48,250
of mafia contraband just as soon as we solve this case we're so incredibly busy with.

177
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,049
Oh yeah, you're real busy. You've done nothing but loiter around my store all day.

178
00:24:53,049 --> 00:25:01,210
What can we say? We love to loiter. Only water? Oh, you mean ice coffee? Not yet. Our journey to

179
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:09,130
the dark side has just begun. I fucking hate being on camera. I'm such a fucking yin and yang

180
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:16,569
on camera. I love being on camera, but I hate being watched. Does that make any sense? I love

181
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:24,420
being on camera. I don't like being watched. Figure that one out. You'll get it. All right,

182
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:35,740
so that's one task done. Hey, wait a second. Why didn't b-task do what? Hey! My camera!

183
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:43,720
Just filmed with the camera turned off. I'm gonna just put a piece of tape on it.

184
00:25:44,440 --> 00:26:11,509
All right, one out of three. Now we need to pretend to kill Sybil. What the fuck are you

185
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:19,720
talking about? All right, I got a game audio. The game audio is off. It's fine. All right,

186
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,119
so what else do we have? I have the listening device. I'm gonna assume maybe we get

187
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:30,869
Sybil to be like, ah, don't kill me! And then shoot the gun, right? To make it sound like,

188
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:47,339
ah, I'm dead! But then she would be a bug. Hold on. So now, okay, pull out the gun

189
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:56,920
and be like, hey, like, maybe I could just wing her. I'd better not. I have to get her

190
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:04,920
to say something. Coin? Token? How do I get her to say- You used a couple of bucks in

191
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:13,849
tokens. Thanks, but my career is about to take off, so I'll be fine. You seem nervous.

192
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:19,930
You seem, understandably, a little tense. Maybe you should switch to decaf. What? Oh, yes,

193
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,730
the coffee cup. I'm out of coffee, but I'm so nervous I keep trying to drink it anyway.

194
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,250
I'm so nervous. It's funny how stress can reduce you to just a bundle of mindless reflexes.

195
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,529
Is that what happened to me? Wouldn't it be wonderful- Am I more like Sam or am I more

196
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:43,940
like Max? What would you guys say? What the fuck was that? Max? I don't know.

197
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:51,619
And I know, you know, you know, you don't see it, that's why. But no, personality-wise.

198
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:07,940
What was that? If you don't know what that was, then I'm kind of glad you don't.

199
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:17,210
All right, what about, what else are- Tiki. Coffee cup. That's a token from her.

200
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:25,640
All right. What can I do with the coffee cup? Hold all my calls, please. Hey,

201
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:35,220
keep away from my intercom. Can I play with that? No, it drives people crazy.

202
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:44,740
Put poison in it? No. I have to put more coffee in it? Try this. You can't kill somebody

203
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:51,450
with coffee, can you? You can kill somebody with a coffee pot, but why would I poison a

204
00:28:51,450 --> 00:29:00,150
coffee mug? One of the coffee mugs could just be used as a weapon. Tissue. Is this the kind

205
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:05,690
with hallow in the sheets or extra soft? Chloroform, actually. Some of my therapy

206
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,789
patients used to get a little rowdy. Too much of anything kills you. I'm afraid to touch those.

207
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:23,430
I could think of a few things. So how'd I- All right, so I need to-

208
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:27,670
I have her coffee mug. I need to get her to, like, scream or something or

209
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:36,619
a voice message or her yelling or- What do I do with the coffee mug?

210
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:43,559
Can I play with this? No. Why not? I'm gonna be doing a lot of this, so I gotta move the camera.

211
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,740
This is what I do when I play a game like this. I'll show you.

212
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,190
I got my elbow just resting over here. This is a good shot, I think,

213
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,589
of, like, my detached face from my body, like, cocked that way.

214
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:05,099
I've got half a mind to stretch out for a little bit. I think you have to stretch the

215
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:15,049
whole thing or it rips. You baffle me sometimes, Max. I stopped watching the stream to watch the

216
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:24,460
documentary you talked about. Give us a review. This must be how the toy mafia is keeping an eye

217
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:30,970
on Sybil. Functional and delicious looking. Wow. Turns out I don't like that angle very much at

218
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:39,619
all. I'm going back here. So can I put something over that? I feel vaguely ridiculous. You

219
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:43,619
shouldn't, Sam. There's nothing vague about it at all. So if they're monitoring what's going

220
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:52,200
on here, how can I pretend to kill her? This is what they do in the movie. I appreciate you

221
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,559
trying to defend me, Sam, but there's nobody there. There was a gnat, or at least I think I saw one.

222
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:07,849
Okay. I probably need something else. How do I make it look like she was poisoned or killed

223
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:19,529
or dead? You can smell me through the face cam today. I should smell like Dove body spray.

224
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:28,789
That's what I use. I go underneath both armpits and, like, across the chest once. Dove

225
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:40,230
men plus care. Clean laundry. It's the clean laundry one. I smell like clean laundry right

226
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:49,029
now. Not like puke. Somebody said puke. Fuck you. Somebody said puke. I mean, I did puke

227
00:31:49,029 --> 00:32:04,859
earlier, but I washed my hands and face and shit. I'm gonna go back to the casino. What

228
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:22,789
about my office? I don't know. I still have coins. What's the third test? Take the

229
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:26,390
meatball sub back from wherever it was. Wait, is the meatball something like my trash can

230
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:42,089
or something? I don't know. Let's take a look up here. Show me the money. Show me the sandwich.

231
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:47,609
Show me the money. You show me the sandwich, I'll show you the money. I will, I tell you. Just

232
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:53,690
show me the money. I think we've got a real gun as a cap gun. Don't be scared. Trying to

233
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:59,210
vent something hot, Leonard? Like a meatball sandwich, Leonard? A meatball sandwich, you

234
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,089
stole, Leonard? You two stay back or I swear by my mother's bedspread, I'll shoot you both.

235
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,220
Excuse me, are you by any chance holding us at gunpoint with a harmless cap gun?

236
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,259
I'm not gonna kill us with that thing. Always a cheat, always a cheat, eh, Leonard? What?

237
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:22,980
No. Sick of a little buddy. I thought you'd never sick.

238
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:31,369
Violence, violence! Okay, Leonard, are you gonna tell us where the sandwich is or are

239
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:36,569
we gonna have to get rough with her? We put a tire on him? I'll never talk. Oh. There ain't

240
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:41,130
nothing you can do to break me. Nothing. Does your mother know what you've become?

241
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:46,410
Don't you talk about my mama. My mama's a saint. Is she the saint of stern-o-heated

242
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:51,690
fried food? Because if so, she may have another follower. Hold on, Max. I think we've just

243
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:57,289
found our captive's weak spot. Which? His uninspired diction or his laughably bad grammar?

244
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:01,369
Neither. I wish. I say we hit this cheatin' slime receptacle where it hurts the most.

245
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:04,569
Right in the mother. You mean- We're gonna go talk to mom?

246
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:09,050
That's right, Max. It's time to pull out the yo mama jokes.

247
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:18,170
Uh oh. No, not that. Anything but that. Leonard, yo mama's so fat. Uh, she's so

248
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,090
frat. Not good enough. Like, curdled goat's milk on a warm summer day. I can never

249
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:26,409
remember the punch lines. Like, that's funny. I remember all the punch lines, but I can never

250
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:30,650
remember the setups. I can help. Well then, Max, I think we'll have to break this two-bit

251
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:40,519
barman as a team. Follow my lead. Yo mama's so fat. She plays pool with the planets. A classic.

252
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:55,320
Yo mama's so fat. She plays- Where is it? Why am I getting minus two's for that? That is

253
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:09,349
a classic yo mama joke. But there's more. She showed up early for her own funeral.

254
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,909
She knitted a sweater with all her own materials. She brings coupons to the penny

255
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:18,630
arcade. If she fell in nuclear waste, no one would notice. What does that have to do with being

256
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:28,579
fat? Her mouth would make a long shorman- This is- I think I have to make this- Okay.

257
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:34,900
She has more molds than an origami accordion. Oh, it's true. It's working. Let's keep it

258
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,380
up a little, buddy. He's got to connect them. Okay, making grown men weep. A f*** time for

259
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:47,219
the whole family. All right. Yo mama's so radiant. That's- that's a nice thing,

260
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:52,099
though. Isn't that radiant mean she's glowing and she's wonderful? Perky. She's up. She's having

261
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:55,780
fun. She's moving around. She's thrifty. She's really quick on her feet and she can

262
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:05,820
steal things easily. Your mama's so vulgar. Yo mama's so vulgar. She beat out Sam for best

263
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,590
in show. Her mouth would make a long shorman blush. That's the right one, right? Her mouth

264
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:18,150
would make a long shorman blush. Oh, it hurts. It hurts. Yes, we're definitely making a dent

265
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:26,619
now. Let's keep it up a little, buddy. Okay. Your mama's so punctual. Let's take a break.

266
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:33,320
No, your mama's so punctual, thrifty, perky, radiant. These are all good qualities.

267
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:42,280
I mean, this one, unless we're talking about in the morning. You know what I'm saying?

268
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:57,190
It's probably this one. Yo mama's so thrifty. She's so thrifty. She brings coupons to the

269
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:05,030
penny arcade. She brings coupons to the penny arcade. Oh mama, make it stop. Why's he turning

270
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:10,630
red? He's getting closer to breaking. Let's keep it up, little buddy. Yeah. We've got the same tone

271
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:14,550
here, don't we? This is now when I see it in real time. I know what you're saying now.

272
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,539
I just have to have to see. I have to see for myself. You know what I mean?

273
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:34,599
Is it the same? Oh, whatever. Who cares? It's the lighting. Look, I had sun today

274
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:51,639
and yesterday. I live in Las Vegas. It's like 150 degrees sometimes. 120 maybe. Radiant,

275
00:37:51,639 --> 00:38:00,090
perky, punctual. Punctual means you're so, you're never late. Your mama's so punctual.

276
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:15,750
The only time she's low is at a limbo contest. She showed up early for her own damn funeral.

277
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:23,829
Showed up early for her own funeral. This can all be over if you'll just tell us where the

278
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:32,099
sandwich is. No. Let's hit him one more time, Sam. Your mama's so perky. Your mama's so perky.

279
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:44,460
Oh, that's not right. She beat out Sam for best in show. She knitted a sweater with all

280
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:55,320
her own materials. The only time she's low is at a limbo contest. The only time she's low

281
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:04,340
is at a limbo contest. Oh, okay. Okay. I'll tell you where the sandwich is. Just leave my mom alone.

282
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:11,139
Red Face Streamer tortures self in cartoon violence themed video game. I never even

283
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:16,019
took the sandwich out of the casino. Hitted in the pride slot of the one-armed bandit

284
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:20,099
and then took the one-arm so no one could win it. So, oh, it's where is it? To the next

285
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:28,469
question. Where's the arm? I got it right here. Oh, jerk bag. How did you not notice that before?

286
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:33,510
I was too busy taking his cap gun to notice that extra arm. We'd best get back to the casino

287
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:39,829
and win back that sandwich. See you around, sucker. Wait, aren't you gonna untie me? Hello,

288
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:46,230
guys? No, we're gonna keep you tied up and have the rats eat you. Anybody? Yeah,

289
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:55,849
see you in like six days. Was that too much? That might have been too much. I wouldn't leave them

290
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:59,449
there for six days. I'd leave them there for like a minute and I'd come back and be like,

291
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:03,130
okay, we'll untie you now and send you the proper authorities to deal with you.

292
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:09,820
Yin and yang, guys. You guys, I'm too spulked. It's like, you know, lawful

293
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:20,119
and then fucking unlawful. They live together. All right, so now I just need to kill civil.

294
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:29,769
Let's go back to the casino and do this. Where are we going, Sam? Teddy bears mafia

295
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:35,050
free playland. Lawful good and lawful good. What would lawful good even mean?

296
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,710
You're not the guy that does anything bad or good. You just laugh at the jokes.

297
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,710
No, you laugh at clean good jokes. You don't laugh at like dirty mean jokes.

298
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,949
Mafia free playland. Lawful evil would be you laughing like mean shit. The mafia plays

299
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:58,650
for free. And raffle neutral means you decide between, you know, laughing and,

300
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,849
you know, maybe you think something is funny but you shouldn't but you still laugh at it.

301
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:12,579
All right, let's go this way. Chaotic raffle. Chaotic raffle. Hey, the one-armed bandit's one

302
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:37,079
arm is missing. Stolen by a bandit perhaps? Why? I still don't get it. There's only two.

303
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:56,739
Presto. Shitting Mario and the gnome. No other exist. I want like an ASCII of my face.

304
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:02,179
I'd still ban it but like I don't want that.

305
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:18,409
What the fuck? What the fuck is shitting Mario? You don't want to know. You do not want to

306
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:25,690
know the answer to that question. Let me see that. Yes, that's definitely the sandwich.

307
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:32,840
Teddy bear will be very pleased. What is he talking about? Generally yes. Hey Sam,

308
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,599
are we mafia yet? I can't explain that. Well, there's still that little matter of rubbing

309
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,840
out our hands. My hands are so much bigger than my head. Oh right. It's so easy to forget

310
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:55,159
these things. All right, now he's gonna kill Sybil. The son has scorched his brain.

311
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:03,159
I have the cap gun though. Cap gun, coffee, shoot. Okay, this is where we're getting some

312
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:10,059
knowledge here. Cap gun makes the bang. She falls back and pretends to die, screams. It's

313
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:17,510
all on camera. I'm gonna walk up to her. I'm gonna listen, Sybil. This is what we're

314
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,269
gonna do. I'm gonna shoot you with this cap gun and then Max is gonna scream in obscenity.

315
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:44,539
He's right. I will. Easy little buddy. I'm gonna go something like that. You crack me up.

316
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:56,500
You crack me up little screamer. All right, listen, I've got something for you. Just what

317
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:15,110
do you think you're doing? Looks like he missed her. How do I? I don't understand how do I make

318
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:22,699
her pretend like she's falling. Maybe she's, can I put something in the coffee and she fall?

319
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:30,019
I don't, but why wouldn't I just tell her to pretend to fall? I'm afraid to touch those.

320
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:34,179
I'm afraid to touch. Can I put them in something? Can I put them in the coffee?

321
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:41,659
Who wouldn't want us leaving her cup there? How do I pick up something like that? Stop

322
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:51,800
flexing your shoulders. Do whatever I want, okay? Have you stop me? It's the cap gun,

323
00:44:51,800 --> 00:45:01,179
but she has to fall down. What's that you keep doing with your arm? What? Oh, I think there

324
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:06,579
was a coffee cup here a minute ago. Throw boiling hot coffee in her face. Yikes is right.

325
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:16,309
Are you sure we can't talk you into faking your own death? I'm sure. We'll be back.

326
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:21,670
I know you will. You're the only two I can trust. All right. Fine. Really? She should consider

327
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:28,150
guilt slinger as her next profession. Give her coffee. So maybe I go to the coffee,

328
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,710
go to Bosco's and get coffee. Give her the coffee. Make sure it's not coffee she wants.

329
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:42,619
Have her go into it like a caffeine binge. But what's that going to do? She's going

330
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:46,780
to clean her house and do all of her taxes early. What about that? A lot of caffeine.

331
00:45:46,780 --> 00:46:03,449
What's that going to do to you? Your ear looks infected. That's probably just hair.

332
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:21,000
He's getting redder. I'm not getting redder. All right. Next time I see the word red,

333
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:42,760
I'll just ban the word red. Hey guys, what color is that coffee pot? Why do I have no

334
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:58,550
power here? I can't clear the chat. How do I have no power in my own stream? I have to

335
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:03,099
talk to fucking Dave Twitch about that one. What's going on there? All right. I need the

336
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:17,159
coffee. Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do? Give her a smudgy? What's that called?

337
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:42,440
A smudgy? Put nacho cheese in it? I put ketchup in here. Does this be blood?

338
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:52,539
So I have to shoot the throw the ketchup all over and then shoot the cap gun?

339
00:47:53,340 --> 00:48:09,050
What about the freezer? Is she going to like hold it over and just sludge it on top of her

340
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:22,980
head? Find out what happens. Can you do another bicep curls video to celebrate 225,000 followers?

341
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:29,639
I don't think I could lift it. I'm not sure I could actually lift it, so no.

342
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:40,619
Can you add more space to the side of your head though? Oh, my OCD is killing me. Yeah,

343
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:52,150
I'll fix it. Wait, did you want more? Oh, you're talking about over here. I see what you mean.

344
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:59,000
There you go. Perfect. Can you make your head a little wider? Yeah. Why is it too thin for

345
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:15,909
you? Yeah, I could do that. Oh my goodness. Thank you. I'd lose my head if it wasn't

346
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:21,909
attached. That's never stopped me. Make it a little bit wider. I mean, if that makes you

347
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:35,940
comfortable and happy, I don't want to make you, you know. She's just drinking the ketchup.

348
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:50,329
We'll be back. I know you will. You're the only two. Dude, can you bet it's not fitting my

349
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:54,650
widescreen TV? Oh, fuck. That's right. We've got 4k televisions now. I forgot. I'm sorry,

350
00:49:54,650 --> 00:50:01,739
guys. I know. I'm still trying to get the hang of this. That should fit the 4k screen,

351
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:24,920
right? Hold on. Holy shit. Look at how fucked up I look. This is like uncanny valley.

352
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:43,429
That's terrifying. I look like a fucking lizard. Or it rips. You baffle me sometimes. I need to do

353
00:50:43,429 --> 00:50:47,030
this. I have to make it. I have to make the one fucking awful joke of the evening. Here we go.

354
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:55,510
You ready? No, I want to hit him. I think I've had enough of you for the moment. Okay. But

355
00:50:55,510 --> 00:51:01,449
be sure to. I don't think I can get this done. I want to like whack him and then have

356
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:21,820
me get Goompa crushed. Never mind. Just what do you think you're doing? Looks like he

357
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:27,610
missed her. Can I shoot the coffee cup and have the blood go everywhere?

358
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:42,460
What? No, that's not how that works. What? No, I just actually killed her.

359
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:51,219
It wouldn't block the bullet. I actually killed her. What happened to the picture?

360
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:58,059
Who cares? Now that she's whacked, we don't need to keep watching her, do we?

361
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:02,539
It went through the coffee cup and hit her in the chest. These things always make me

362
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:09,239
You're a real sociopath, Don Bear. I mean that as a compliment, naturally. Naturally.

363
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:17,510
Hey Sam, webcam tastes like chicken. Good idea, John. Now those toy mafia goons won't

364
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,789
see Sybil wake up, which could be important to our continued good health. Well,

365
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:24,469
you won't see her wake up either. We've learned that webcams go great with ketchup.

366
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,349
Another fun fact to add to the crime fighting arsenal.

367
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:40,170
Is this right? This is longer. You know what? I think we are. Let's go and see

368
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:48,969
Chuckles. Sam, Max, you have done what we have asked of you. Acts of intelligence,

369
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:54,570
malevolence, and subservience. And we welcome you into the ranks of the Orso Nostra.

370
00:52:54,570 --> 00:53:01,050
Indeed. My stuff runneth over. There's a small ritual with the ceremonial picnic baskets

371
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:05,769
and then a few other technicalities, and then Joey will show up with some cold cuts.

372
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:10,329
But first, as a sign of respect, I will remove my mask, which is good.

373
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:12,409
Who is it? What's the reveal?

374
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:48,139
Power that the toy mafia could offer. But what happened to the previous teddy bear?

375
00:53:48,139 --> 00:53:49,980
Poor teddy bear. What happened?

376
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,380
It's a mole.

377
00:54:05,269 --> 00:54:06,789
This is fucked up. There we go. That's better.

378
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:28,360
Only modern technology is horribly, horribly wrong.

379
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:46,019
I'm trying to shoot their tire. I can't shoot behind me.

380
00:54:47,059 --> 00:55:07,239
All right, put it away then. Put the gun away. No, sit down. Sit down. No, sit down. Can I

381
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:14,460
drop something on him? That would be... Hold on, I think I got it. Don't worry,

382
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:23,659
they're using a cap gun. We'll be fine. One, two, three. That guy's dead. That guy's

383
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:26,940
dead.

384
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,019
Let's go take down that fat little fraud once and for all. Good idea.

385
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:44,570
Hey, the dawn is gone. Find out just what that traitorous mole there is doing.

386
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:49,769
You know, without that menacing mumble, he doesn't seem capable of planning brunch,

387
00:55:49,769 --> 00:55:54,969
much less a dastardly master plan. Agreed. But in my experience, there's always something

388
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:58,809
interesting behind any door that says, do not enter under pain of death.

389
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:04,650
Well, now that we have free rein to look at stuff, let's go look at the chalkboard.

390
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:12,699
This gobbledygook's best left to the freelance accountants.

391
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:20,360
Racketeering, extortion, smuggling, smuggling. I'm not much of a fighter.

392
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:32,039
I did that yesterday. I can't do that. I'm not allowed to do that twice in two days.

393
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:44,940
Yesterday's was better.

394
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,940
Is it a grenade?

395
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:18,539
Slaves. You can do the factory work now that you've rid me of my enough underlings.

396
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,340
Look, look at the hypno bear.

397
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:31,659
Don't you feel sleepy? Don't we? We don't. Hypnosis won't work on either of us,

398
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:36,460
but play along until we get that gun from it. I asked you a question, slaves.

399
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:41,820
Yes, master. Yeah, so I feel kind of tired a little bit for some reason.

400
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,059
What he said.

401
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,780
Really? It seems a little off somehow.

402
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:53,500
Maybe it's just me. Oh, I know. Here's a test. Tall one, you shoot the short one.

403
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:56,139
Excuse me, master.

404
00:57:56,619 --> 00:57:58,780
Shoot your friend. I command it.

405
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,420
This blow.

406
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:21,000
Mother of mercy, is this the end of little maxi? Oh death, where is that guy?

407
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:28,010
The pain and only two days to retirement. He's got a promise.

408
00:58:32,329 --> 00:58:34,329
Pretty good Bugs Bunny death scene.

409
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:41,610
Cowards die a thousand deaths. Well, heroes die, but once unless they're playing video games, in which case heroes die a lot, too.

410
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:47,210
So good night, fresh prince, and may charlie's angels sing thee to thy rest.

411
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,570
Right. Well, so cold.

412
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,210
Why am I so cold?

413
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,500
He's gonna break the machine. Don't do that. You're gonna break it.

414
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:16,949
We shouldn't be breaking that machine. We can use that to produce grain or something somewhere.

415
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,750
Okay. Good job, slave. Just about ready to have you shoot him again.

416
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:24,389
Yes, master.

417
00:59:24,869 --> 00:59:30,630
Now, slave. You run the factory while I read the paper. Just get the hypno bears sorted for delivery.

418
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:32,789
I didn't do anything.

419
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:39,989
Yes, master. Good, good. I don't understand. Now I'm off to see what wry observation Fred Masset has for us today.

420
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:48,789
Max, you keep playing dead. I'll figure out some way to bring teddy bear and his factory to their respective knees.

421
00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:51,269
I can't hear you. I'm dead.

422
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:56,869
All right, so um

423
00:59:56,869 --> 00:59:59,510
We could have just arrested him. Why don't we just arrest him right now?

424
01:00:04,019 --> 01:00:06,179
Hey, this isn't even a real fire extinguisher.

425
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:13,340
Well, that didn't do much.

426
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:20,420
They're still producing these. Halt. Halt the production. What do I got in here? I have a token.

427
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:30,130
Insidious. Nefarious.

428
01:00:30,789 --> 01:00:32,789
Nefarious.

429
01:00:32,789 --> 01:00:35,659
This is quite a gizmo.

430
01:00:35,659 --> 01:00:36,940
All right, so

431
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:37,980
um

432
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,840
What do we got over here?

433
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,000
One-armed bandit machine in development.

434
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,480
Anybody got a screw loose?

435
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:53,139
Screwdriver.

436
01:00:53,139 --> 01:01:06,150
Menacing computer, which means nothing. I really don't want to screw that. Why not?

437
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:12,139
I wouldn't know where to begin. Why not? Just try. I did it in VR. It's not hard.

438
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:18,010
What about like here?

439
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:25,639
What about that hopper over there? I think these are the voice gizmos for the insidious hypnotic bears.

440
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:29,239
The voice gizmos?

441
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,320
Um

442
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,289
I don't want to screw that.

443
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:38,170
Do I have to change them with the the voice bug?

444
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:42,940
The voice bug's still sitting on civil's desk. I can't leave.

445
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:50,570
Master. What is it hypnotic slave? Something wrong with the machine?

446
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,409
No.

447
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:54,409
Then don't bother me.

448
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,090
Don't even try it.

449
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,250
Yes, master.

450
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:06,539
You don't have to pretend anymore. You have a real gun.

451
01:02:07,179 --> 01:02:11,260
I much like the funnies these days. They tend not to be.

452
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:18,789
All right, what about the screwdriver on the one-armed bandit? Can I like twist it off? Do something with it? Okay.

453
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,170
Oops.

454
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,150
Oh, there it is.

455
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,150
You're on fire.

456
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:38,679
And it'll pick this one up.

457
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:58,840
So what does that do? You're on fire. Wait, is he also hypnotized? A lot of hypnotism in this game.

458
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,860
Well, let's go tell him he's on fire.

459
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:14,840
I know she's married now, but that Cathy who's still smoking hot. Oh, that's fucking weird. What is it now slave?

460
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:26,039
You're on fire. I'm on. I'm on fire. Help. Help. I'm on fire. I'm on fire. Not real extinguisher.

461
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,599
Sorry, pal.

462
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:37,300
Would be on chivalrous. Anyway.

463
01:03:37,699 --> 01:03:40,070
And when he's not paying attention.

464
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:48,389
All right, max get up. Let's go. You okay little buddy. I could use a mattress.

465
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:57,420
Stay put. I'll work. By the way. Me too. All right. All right. Oh, I know he can be.

466
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:06,469
I can do this. Here goes nothing. He'll get he'll get zonked up and dragged over.

467
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:11,300
Is he too big for this?

468
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:27,980
Oh no, he's clogging up the chocolate vent. Nice work Sam. Thanks pal.

469
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:31,559
The whole thing has been contaminated.

470
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,760
We have to replace all that chocolate.

471
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:45,380
Exclusive

472
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,769
Like 5 000 pounds per square inch of air underneath them and shoot them out.

473
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:04,679
Wait, what?

474
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:09,800
That's what I call breaking the bank and the sidewalk and the water main and the buffet table.

475
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,920
You're really broken up about that buffet table. Aren't you max?

476
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:19,719
It was the only innocent in this whole affair sam. I mean apart from the bystanders and their pets. Buck up little pal.

477
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,760
Maybe the commissioner how many people are in that factory meal at squirrel garden when we tell them how we crack the case.

478
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:33,079
He bet it for all the hard work I did. I want to no three jelly lemurs with extra salt. So we just killed everybody

479
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:40,489
and here is the

480
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:50,309
Protagonist no the antagonist of the next one. The factory's been destroyed. Repeat the factory has been destroyed. Commence plan b.

481
01:05:50,469 --> 01:05:57,369
He hits his head backwards with the camera. What the fuck man?

482
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,789
The mole on the bob and the meatball. That one's done.

483
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:06,420
A nice mouth close-up. They don't do those anymore.

484
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:16,150
Took you long enough. What I

485
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:23,800
Let's do the next one episode four.

486
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:31,849
Ted E. Bear

487
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,280
Now wait a week before I play episode four. Well, I also took a week off.

488
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:55,300
Chuggy cheese.

489
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:01,380
Why am I so red?

490
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,500
Game tap. I told you guys that story about game tap, right? I think I already have.

491
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:11,130
Have I? I have. I know I have.

492
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:18,619
Bob bug just touched me. I've never told that story. I've not told the game tap story.

493
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:24,739
I swear to god I have.

494
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:30,179
Well, why do I get this? Um, all right.

495
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:33,300
Let me refresh your memory.

496
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:36,980
So game tap was a service. It was actually way before its time.

497
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:43,699
It was a service where you paid a monthly fee and you got access to a bunch of games and some of them were

498
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:46,500
retro games. Some of them were Genesis games.

499
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,219
Super Nintendo, right? They had a whole catalog of stuff and they had new stuff come out too.

500
01:07:51,699 --> 01:07:56,099
Some maybe a couple of years older, but it was like a steam, but it was streamlined through the game tap app.

501
01:07:57,369 --> 01:07:59,210
It was actually really cool.

502
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:02,329
So I had I got it for a while. I was on it for a while.

503
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:07,690
And after maybe two or three four months, I decided I didn't want it anymore. It was like I was

504
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:12,329
I didn't really like the didn't they weren't coming out with anything that I really cared that much about with I played

505
01:08:12,329 --> 01:08:16,250
all the back catalog of their retro games and I kind of was done with it. So

506
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:22,409
I called up to cancel it and I got on the phone and I got to the cancellation, you know, the sales department.

507
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:26,170
Yeah, you have to do the shit by phone because remember this is like fucking 15 years ago.

508
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:29,210
This is like at least 10 to 15 years ago and the person on the phone

509
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:34,170
told me oh that's uh unfortunate that you want to uh leave the service. Uh, well

510
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:40,010
what if I you know, maybe maybe get a little more chance and what if I gave you a free month to game tap?

511
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:43,739
I was like

512
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:49,979
um yeah okay fine like I guess I guessed so I don't have to pay for this month.

513
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:53,659
No, no free month game tap. He had that voice to us. What a guy.

514
01:08:53,659 --> 01:08:57,100
So I got a free month to game tap and I continued to play and didn't really

515
01:08:57,819 --> 01:09:01,260
I wasn't playing it that much. So at the end of that month another 30 days went by.

516
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:08,819
I called again to cancel and it was another person and I told him I want to cancel and

517
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:14,260
they said you could probably guess oh but you know I know you want to leave but what if uh

518
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:24,949
what if you got a free month of game tap the service for free and I'm like okay okay oh sure

519
01:09:24,949 --> 01:09:29,029
I guess I'll have it again another free month. This happened two more times.

520
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:36,520
After the fourth month I was just like you know what I don't really want this anymore.

521
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:44,380
I don't want game tap anymore. I tried to cancel it more than three times.

522
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:51,270
I didn't even want it for free. No I didn't. After like two months or three months it was just like

523
01:09:51,270 --> 01:10:02,840
I don't use it. I don't want this. You could probably still have game tap to this day. Yeah

524
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,979
but I feel like I've told that story before. I wonder what would have happened if I kept calling

525
01:10:07,979 --> 01:10:11,979
to cancel. Would they have just kept would they have just given me free months forever?

526
01:10:12,699 --> 01:10:18,859
Did game tap go out of business? It did a long time ago. Game tap went out of business

527
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:23,770
not that much further after it came out which you probably could

528
01:10:24,409 --> 01:10:27,689
understand that if they were just giving free months to people that tried to cancel.

529
01:10:28,859 --> 01:10:33,579
I think their theory look and here's the theory right if you have a credit card that's linked

530
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:38,489
up to something like Netflix you don't really think about that payment. It just kind of

531
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:43,449
happens and if you were given a free month of Netflix and you're like oh okay I guess

532
01:10:43,449 --> 01:10:48,810
am I like my credit card will I guess stay linked right so then after a month you just

533
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:54,869
don't even think about it and you just keep getting charged you just kind of forget about

534
01:10:54,869 --> 01:11:03,579
it right and the companies use that kind of the maybe that process of customer retention

535
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:08,460
over the long term the person will forget that they even cared about it in the first place

536
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:16,340
and their $12 a month will just still come out forever but I would call every month and I

537
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:21,300
would put it to the day to make sure because I was still having fun with game tap so I

538
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:24,579
didn't like that after three months I didn't care that much about it but I was still

539
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:32,199
doing it every so often if you just stopped streaming how imagine how much money you would

540
01:11:32,199 --> 01:11:39,189
make you know uh let me open up the new one you know the interesting thing about that is

541
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:45,380
I uh well let me just save this just in case for some weird reason

542
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:53,590
oh I can't I can't I can't imagine so I thought about that once or twice like if I

543
01:11:53,989 --> 01:12:01,380
if I just stopped streaming right completely would how many people would still just be paying here

544
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:12,039
over the years you know what I mean like it's it's weird to think about that if we call you

545
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:19,420
we would get a free subscription I don't have the power to do that eventually twitch takes

546
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:25,529
your button away that's true but I wondered just just how people kind of just forget

547
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:30,409
that they're uh that they're connected to it and they subscribe to it and

548
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:37,020
it's just an interesting thought experiment to think about I wonder if I just stopped

549
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:43,779
streaming today what would happen how many subscribers would I have in like two years

550
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:51,829
I have a complaint hold on I gotta is this uh oh yeah I forgot I have to watch I gotta take

551

554
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:49,350

857
02:00:32,539 --> 02:00:37,819
the president so soon but now that these idiots are forced by hand we're standing

858

861
02:01:07,479 --> 02:01:11,159
reaction I would have expected from a secret service agent discovering two people over

862
02:01:11,159 --> 02:01:15,560
the decapitated body of the president what do you think this fake body is made of can I keep

866
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:46,380
homes yeah they've reanimated America's most beloved president I always thought

867
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:55,899
Taft was shorter not Taft you deficient my fellow Americans I am Abraham as you know by now

868
02:01:55,899 --> 02:02:02,699
your president was recently murdered by two mysterious interpreters what I am not to fear

869
02:02:02,699 --> 02:02:11,020
and despair I have returned to guide us through this troubled time a vote for me is a vote for

870
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:18,779
Abraham Lincoln I'll get it what's that we've had this talk before Lincoln Memorial right

871
02:02:18,779 --> 02:02:25,340
hydraulic motors and robotic implants yes okay George Washington we're on it Abraham Lincoln

872
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:29,739
that was the commissioner max if this new amendment wins the emergency election the

873
02:02:29,739 --> 02:02:35,100
nefarious forces controlling him will have unchecked power to destroy the entire free world

874
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:40,060
I hate when they do that that's why one of us is going to have to run against him

875
02:02:40,699 --> 02:02:47,340
you got to answer the phone okay fair's fair max we're going to make you the next president

876
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:52,939
of the United States yes we're seeing this episode I'm not going to say it but never mind but

877
02:02:52,939 --> 02:02:58,699
yeah like that every single president that is supposed to be from over 200 years ago or

878
02:02:58,699 --> 02:03:07,270
100 years ago or more always has this voice I'm George Washington I'm Abraham Lincoln

879
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:18,090
I'm Thomas Jefferson I'm Andrew Jackson I'm Ronald Reagan see they all sounded like that

880
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:26,100
but they didn't if you if you did the Abraham Lincoln actually had a high voice it was more

881
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:31,539
like this it was actually kind of like this and if you've seen the Daniel Day Lewis version

882
02:03:31,539 --> 02:03:36,579
is as he did it the way that it was supposed to be looking or this is like two or three

883
02:03:36,579 --> 02:03:43,079
documented cases of Abraham Lincoln talking he wasn't like this breaking my version I'm deleting

884
02:03:43,079 --> 02:03:48,659
the fucking game but that's actually true that's a I'm not making that up it's real

885
02:03:48,659 --> 02:04:03,899
this is like the five percent time when I'm saying something real Mr. Lincoln as a candidate

886
02:04:03,899 --> 02:04:08,380
for office my pal max would like to engage in a thoughtful discussion of the key issues

887
02:04:08,380 --> 02:04:15,579
followed by a round of spikeful Lincoln or Thanos hmm I see well this is a bit irregular

888
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:23,260
as you're well aware I'm the most beloved president in history so I just assumed I'd be

889
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:30,939
running unopposed oh no you didn't you ain't all that I freed the slave I was star of a

890
02:04:30,939 --> 02:04:36,859
popular television sitcom I'm on the penny I was on TV now gentlemen we can resolve this

891
02:04:36,859 --> 02:04:43,739
like adults through moderate reason debate very well then in the spirit of democracy I say

of debates for this emergency election for US presidents in the Republican corner we have the

894
02:04:55,899 --> 02:05:01,420
giant animated statue of Abraham Lincoln and representing the random violence and destruction

895
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:07,180
party there is the hyperkinetic rabbit like creature known as Max acting as completely

896
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:12,539
impartial moderator for the debates will be Sam the candidates are ready so let's listen in

897
02:05:12,539 --> 02:05:18,060
there'd be so much taller than the microphone let's talk about the issues the nation demands

898
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:24,619
family values let's hear your prepared statement time out my fellow Americans warm the crowd up

899
02:05:24,619 --> 02:05:29,979
with a joke I'm gonna treat this like if it is if it was me okay I'd come out there

900
02:05:29,979 --> 02:05:35,899
with the cuffs undone you know like cuffs undone shirt undone you know like as if I

901
02:05:35,899 --> 02:05:39,979
just was dancing at a wedding for 30 minutes right you know I'm talking about when you go

902
02:05:39,979 --> 02:05:44,060
to a wedding and you get all dressed up and you're stiff as a board and then you the first

903
02:05:44,060 --> 02:05:48,140
two songs of the wedding all of a sudden people's ties are undone their shirts are open and their

904
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:51,979
their cups are off so we're talking like two or three songs into wedding is what I would be

905
02:05:51,979 --> 02:06:00,020
presenting myself at and I warm it up with a joke reminds me of a droll story it seems

906
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:06,420
Chester A Arthur and the Pope were kayaking down the Amazon one day suddenly a tiny candiru

907
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:13,220
fish swims up the Pope's and lodges itself in his Arthur grabs the Pope's pliers and swelled up

908
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:21,270
like a melon and the Pope says thanks last time that happened McKinley wanted no wait wait wait

909
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:31,319
I think I told it wrong I wouldn't have done that uh I believe in uh I believe in a uh in a

910
02:06:32,279 --> 02:06:41,479
globalist community I I am the one true I am the no uh let's talk about the issues Mr.

911
02:06:41,479 --> 02:06:45,880
Lincoln I'd like you to tell the voters your stand on some of the tough issues very well

912
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:55,909
how do you plan to solve the problem of toxic wastes where you stand on schools education's

913

really important taxes we got to talk about we got to talk about taxes too what are you

914
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:12,500
going to do about our schools where do you stand on religion and schools

915
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:20,180
I'm glad that I've been given one more life to give for my country Lincoln pulls out his

916
02:07:20,180 --> 02:07:24,340
trusted catchphrase for this election which delights the crowd but seems to have no effect

917
02:07:24,340 --> 02:07:35,029
on the polls I'm supposed to be winning read my lips read my lipstick presentable on stream

918
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:50,140
greetings miserable pro you're not gonna win I'm here to save the country your day of reckoning

919
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:59,460

920
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:07,739
would you describe your tax plan I'm glad that I've been given one more life to give for my

921
02:08:07,739 --> 02:08:12,539
country and Lincoln dodges the question by pulling out his trusty campaign slogan which

922
02:08:12,619 --> 02:08:24,869
places the crowd but has no effect on the polls god damn can't spit it out I was gonna it was

923
02:08:24,869 --> 02:08:28,729
something solid in there and I'm pretending like I'm not gonna freak out about that

924
02:08:29,289 --> 02:08:32,170
um I was waiting for him to say like a tax percentage and I was gonna like

925
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:35,930
I wasn't really gonna do it I'm not gonna ruin my computer what do you think crazy

926
02:08:37,659 --> 02:08:45,260
I believe in the ideal of a global community where America is but a small part we must set

927
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:50,859
aside our differences and work with our fellow nations all united towards one goal

928
02:08:51,739 --> 02:09:00,060
the complete and utter annihilation of the godless Belgians I mean that gets a dog tilt that gets

929
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:07,529
a dog head tilt for me what I want to see you return to prosperity to see a return to the

930
02:09:07,529 --> 02:09:14,489
prosperity of the America we once knew a chicken in every pot and vice versa a pot in

931
02:09:14,489 --> 02:09:25,930
every chicken how do you plan to solve the problem of toxic waste I'm glad that I've been given

932
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:33,449
one more life to give for my country and Lincoln is once again using his trusted campaign slogan

933
02:09:33,449 --> 02:09:37,130
which is all right in the crowd but having no effect on his pole we we gotta we gotta

934
02:09:37,130 --> 02:09:46,260
fuck with that slogan if elected I promise a return to a happier time in America's path

935
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:52,020
the days when giant thunder lizards marched over the fern-covered marshes of the Midwest

936
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:55,939
preying on the upstart mammals that's why I don't have face cam on because I just tried to

937
02:09:55,939 --> 02:10:00,979
swallow that burp and it was gonna be loud and I tried I like to be I like to perform

938
02:10:00,979 --> 02:10:18,520
but I don't like to be watched why don't they bring Sam and Max back is it still going am I

939
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:23,319
just an idiot and making the am I do I have like one piece of the puzzle of knowledge here

940
02:10:24,039 --> 02:10:31,289
if it does tell to tell tell own the characters or was I thought this was like a series before

941
02:10:31,289 --> 02:10:40,039
that well it wasn't this is like a an old point and click adventure game wasn't it

942
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:48,699
yeah there's like a comic book series an old old point and click game yeah LucasArts made

943
02:10:48,699 --> 02:10:55,739
the first one right I'm a uniter not a divide I foresee an America under one rule

944
02:10:55,819 --> 02:11:01,739
it's a bush thing iron fisted rule one rabbit one law I'm united let your neighbors know that

945
02:11:01,739 --> 02:11:11,510
dissent will not be tolerated all hail max I mean what am I supposed to do about this

946
02:11:12,489 --> 02:11:18,170
do we just see every option what I have a dream America how do we like progress this out

947
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:22,810
where I'm in an all nude production of death of a salesman on ice but I haven't studied

948
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:28,170
and I can't remember my lines suddenly it begins to rain marshmallows but that's okay

949
02:11:28,170 --> 02:11:32,170
because trees are made of graham crackers and chocolate bars are the official currency

950
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:39,800
I believe that by working together we can make that dream a reality all right well that's all

951
02:11:40,439 --> 02:11:50,180
stay frosty America cue cards it's the cue cards for Lincoln speak oh I'm glad that I've

1067
02:26:56,540 --> 02:27:04,860
missile defense system a missile defense system missile defense system isn't that more than a

1068
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:11,340
little bit overkill yet we are strong like bear against the pack I'm working on modifying

1069
02:27:11,979 --> 02:27:18,139
part your anti-delivery system that's right it was already programmed to keep people from

1070
02:27:18,139 --> 02:27:22,139
delivering goods to the store so I just went into the database and changed beef jerky to

1071
02:27:22,139 --> 02:27:27,100
intercontinental ballistic missiles so now anyone can just deliver a blimp load of beef jerky to

1072
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:33,430
your store without fear of reprisal it's small price to pay for freedom yeah I remember the

1073
02:27:33,430 --> 02:27:39,989
hot dogs and in school for some weird reason I don't know why this was but why are all

1074
02:27:40,069 --> 02:27:47,860
school lunch hot dogs cut like four times they slice it apart down the middle apart on the

1075
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:52,260
right upon the left they fray out the I don't know why they did that they didn't do that

1076
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:57,180
in your school they like cut them up down the middle like three or four times they would get

1077
02:27:57,180 --> 02:28:12,790
they frayed out that nobody had no they didn't do that anywhere else so they don't

1078
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:19,930
explode in the microwave that's only done for boiled hot dogs well they there you go

1079
02:28:23,459 --> 02:28:31,620
we aren't that old we aren't no now that I got the wrong vocal context there it's not

1080
02:28:31,620 --> 02:28:40,120
we're not that old it's we're not that old oh right okay sometimes you can change the way

1081
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:47,639
that we change the way that sentence works by changing a little bit of inflection all right

1082
02:28:47,639 --> 02:28:51,239
tell us about the missile defense about that missile defense system again I'm working on

1083

from what I can buy this time you like flat root beer too I don't really like that much

1118
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:49,559
carbonated stuff I mean I'm drinking a seltzer water right now but that's just because

1119
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:56,520
uh the only reason why this is in the fridge is because I had family over and you need

1120
02:33:56,520 --> 02:34:04,979
something right I had a bunch of family come over and I didn't want to be the child that

02:34:33,700 --> 02:34:38,340
we want to buy something that is evil but necessary private enterprise

1125
02:34:40,889 --> 02:34:47,450
what do you got what do you got is most glorious invention comrades cider is useful for

1126
02:34:47,450 --> 02:34:55,690
how you say questioning questioning is true serum makes easy even the most difficult

1127
02:34:55,690 --> 02:35:03,129
how you say interrogation interrogation well true serum is this another one of your half-baked

1128
02:35:03,129 --> 02:35:09,049
overpriced gimmicks or does it actually work both will make anyone get rid of inhibitions

1132
02:35:29,190 --> 02:35:35,670
three oh nine rubles how much is that in real money 100 million dollars I think your rate of

1133
02:35:35,670 --> 02:35:41,829
exchange is a little off boscovorsky fall of berlin wall brings great strength to our economy

1134
02:35:43,719 --> 02:35:49,399
100 million isn't that a little pricey for truth serum is bargain it really does work and

abuse prevention people will realize it just like washington jefferson roosevelt and the other

1401
03:19:56,389 --> 03:20:03,430
guy they can overcome their crippling addiction to carbonated beverages george washington never

1402
03:20:03,430 --> 03:20:12,010

rip pulled too hard and i tripped and it fucking fell and it made the hole bigger

1409
03:20:55,959 --> 03:21:03,700
how did west dakota become a separate state the three of us ran for governor together

1410
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:10,100
we got along so well during the campaign and we were all such former tv celebrities that all

1411
03:21:10,180 --> 03:21:15,379
three of us won the voters realized they'd elected three governors for only two states

1412
03:21:15,940 --> 03:21:24,600
that's when the unpleasantness began uh what unpleasantness let's just hear about this

1413
03:21:24,600 --> 03:21:31,079
we fought for a long time about how to divide up the states there was almost a war but we

1414
03:21:31,079 --> 03:21:35,879
divided everything up fairly and all agreed that mount rushmore should be in the south

1415
03:21:36,440 --> 03:21:45,479
we did not you i what you oh never mind you guys if you think there'll be a fashion trend

1416
03:21:46,200 --> 03:21:53,620
where this is really big it's so stretched out to a point where it's stretched down to here

1417
03:21:54,899 --> 03:22:09,780
here it's floppy and all stretched out did somebody just say i look like i'm doing a

my idea was stupid he said your idea of adding herbert hoover hugging the four other presidents

1749
04:15:53,829 --> 04:16:02,149
was the stupidest thing he'd ever heard well it is he wasn't even a president which means

1750
04:16:02,149 --> 04:16:07,430
he certainly wasn't the most loving of all the presidents well at least i didn't suggest

1751
04:16:07,430 --> 04:16:12,229
putting a parking garage in george washington's forehead like some four-eyed

washington monument is really a self-replenishing supply of intercontinental ballistic missiles

1764
04:20:20,170 --> 04:20:26,500
it's good to see it used for something more useful are we not gonna see are we i wonder if

1765
04:20:26,500 --> 04:20:31,540
this will have a significant impact on our delicate ecosystem absolutely my ego is bigger

1766
04:20:31,540 --> 04:20:40,729
already apparently once we've shot them there's no homing beacon to the kremlin doesn't seem

1767
04:20:40,729 --> 04:20:45,610
to be working it was probably turned off in the spirit of glasnost more likely those lazy

commie bastards forgot to change the batteries i don't want to drop like

anything else in here the little ranch not home the streamer dentist now what it would have been

2041
05:06:42,709 --> 05:06:48,069
what you should have said there is if i went in there and put my stream on the tv and he

2042
05:06:48,069 --> 05:06:52,869
looked back and he laughed at me and he was like okay buddy and he points up to a webcam

the internet controls everything the internet dreams of a press yes a world of games

2119
05:17:03,099 --> 05:17:08,459
a world of commerce a world with neither boundaries nor exits now using the combined

2121
05:17:21,900 --> 05:17:26,700
to universal knowledge could cause computerized chaos on a global scale it's not what you know

2122
05:17:26,700 --> 05:17:32,860
it's who you know the internet knows everyone by making use of its multiple networks of

2123
05:17:33,740 --> 05:17:36,299
villains they got it they caught this 10 15 years ago

2124

where does the hypnosis come in reality 2.0 is rated e everyone all will fall there is no escape

2125
05:17:50,200 --> 05:17:55,319
of course this isn't about screwing up computers at all it's about the people it is

2126
05:17:55,319 --> 05:18:00,919
reality 2.0 is nothing less than a fiendish plot to hypnotically enslave well everybody's

2127
05:18:00,919 --> 05:18:05,720
plot is hypnotic enslavement apparently all we have to do is destroy the internet and all our

2128
05:18:05,720 --> 05:18:18,900
problems are solved you know they're onto something sybil asked us to tender her resignation

05:24:10,439 --> 05:24:16,040
continuous packet exchange with the central time server and vice-versa some inaccuracy may

whatever it was i guess it just wasn't that memorable i'm going to come to the next meetup

2403
05:56:36,139 --> 05:56:39,419
to flex by height on you i'm going to be wearing shoes that may be three inches tall

2404
05:56:40,380 --> 05:56:52,169
so jokes on you all right so it's on his national so how do we see bosco's we're

2405
05:56:52,169 --> 05:57:20,740
going to spin him around right so how do we get bosco to turn around i swear to god

2406
05:57:21,619 --> 05:57:29,959
some of you guys think that apparently apparently like five eight is three inches tall you

2407
05:57:29,959 --> 05:57:37,029
know the average height in the united states is five nine right boy is that is that like a

2408
05:57:37,029 --> 05:57:46,569
fucking foot off the ground oh he's not paying attention oh boss goes in the grips of those

2409
05:57:46,569 --> 05:57:52,169
reality 2.0 goggles we better save him sam it's so depressing in here without his omnipresent

2410
05:57:52,169 --> 05:57:58,090
paranoia to lift my spirit all right so how do i get him to turn around i need to i need to

2411
05:57:58,810 --> 05:58:17,029
zoom into his neck is there any way to see his neck the most historic weenie's this

2413
05:58:23,619 --> 05:58:30,490
fun i know that i'm huge the most historical so how do i get him to fucking turn around

2414
05:58:31,290 --> 05:58:35,740
i wonder if i can like talk to him in the virtual world and make him turn around

2415
05:58:37,189 --> 05:58:50,900
and then take the goggles off okay let's get him to spin around hot sure how wow that rump is

2417
05:59:07,139 --> 05:59:16,919
to turn around this may well go down as the most ill-advised question i've ever asked but

2418
05:59:16,919 --> 05:59:24,119
may we see your private tattoo no besides i didn't tattooed on my virtual avatar it's on my real

2618
06:43:24,389 --> 06:43:37,049

2627
06:44:52,409 --> 06:44:55,689
get him to take it off i think we knocked him clear out of this reality a little buddy

2628
06:44:55,689 --> 06:45:00,250
this is clearly an artificial intelligence designed to mimic bosco while he's offline

2629
06:45:00,250 --> 06:45:09,459
it does work trusteth me trusteth me the similarity is uncanny all right so in the

2630
06:45:09,459 --> 06:45:21,580
real world bosco is going to be probably lying on the ground oh he's not hey bosco

2631
06:45:21,580 --> 06:45:25,900
glad to see you've kicked the second reality he's got the yeah you guys were right i was

2637
06:45:58,569 --> 06:46:14,599
what what is it oh nothing unbelievable imagine forgetting something like that

2638
06:46:15,479 --> 06:46:25,189
yeah how did she not remember that it seems impossible she just must not give a shit at all

2639
06:46:35,830 --> 06:46:38,470

2674
06:52:17,700 --> 06:52:23,060
that continues to the east a small shop labeled civils lies to the northwest just in front of

2675
06:52:23,060 --> 06:52:27,380
a pulsating control room parked near an unremarkable office building is an old

2676
06:52:27,380 --> 06:52:33,299
desoto apparently painted by someone with a severe color blindness suddenly a massive

2677
06:52:33,299 --> 06:52:38,900
reality quake sends the desoto hurtling into the control room destroying both possibly as a

2678
06:52:38,900 --> 06:52:44,259
result the unremarkable office building becomes a remarkable two-story tall pamela anderson

2679
06:52:44,259 --> 06:52:49,139
who mumbles something unintelligible before surfing away on a stray pop-up ad on ironically

2680
06:52:49,139 --> 06:52:54,580
advertising a pop-up blocker in the distance an aerial squadron of potbelly pigs begins

2681
06:52:54,580 --> 06:53:00,279
performing precision loop-de-loops the world appears to be ending the internet is here

2682
06:53:00,279 --> 06:53:09,799
it has lost its respect for living things you see a respect for living things here go

2683
06:53:12,540 --> 06:53:27,270
uh go east as you thrive on the desolate street corner a devastating aftershock tears to reality

2684
06:53:27,270 --> 06:53:34,220
ripping bosco's e-convenience from its very foundation the constants store begin to spill

2685
06:53:34,220 --> 06:53:39,830
out of the front door see a blue slime 28 potions and a hot rump fall into the void

2686
06:53:39,830 --> 06:53:44,229
lost forever after a moment an ai bosco slowly comes sliding out the door muttering

2687
06:53:44,229 --> 06:53:50,619
it does work trust me trust me as it plummets out of sight you see bosco's e-convenience

2688

2691
06:54:45,930 --> 06:54:53,819
okay civilized in the northwest three continues to the east you know it's here just lost its

2692
06:54:53,819 --> 06:54:59,259
respect for living things you see your respect for living things here okay look at the respect

2693
06:54:59,259 --> 06:55:03,180
for living things you see nothing special about the respect for living things intrigued

2694
06:55:03,180 --> 06:55:12,200
or repulsed ambiguity max it's what makes life worthwhile again okay uh get respect for

2695
06:55:12,200 --> 06:55:18,979
living things as you reach for there is a terrible tremor and a giant crack tears apart

2696
06:55:18,979 --> 06:55:23,700
the sidewalk the respect for the living things slides jelly-like into the resulting chasm i knew

2697
06:55:23,700 --> 06:55:28,340
it wasn't going to be that easy i never ceased to be impressed by your unwavering optimism max

2698
06:55:32,169 --> 06:55:46,250
at your feet is a yawning chasm leading down uh i think we should just go into the chasm go

2699
06:55:46,250 --> 06:55:56,709
down you descend into a gloomy pit of darkness gloomier even than that street above

2700
06:55:57,349 --> 06:56:03,029
carcasses of small businesses lie here gutted and mauled a strange smell hangs in the air

2701
06:56:03,029 --> 06:56:08,869
dank and notorious from the dim light of the street above you get a quick glimpse of a giant

2702
06:56:08,869 --> 06:56:13,909
hideous figure before you you fear for your life as you realize what it is a gruesome shambling

2703
06:56:13,909 --> 06:56:19,430
corporate presence before you can react the shambling corporate presence gobbles up the

2704
06:56:19,430 --> 06:56:24,389
respect for the living things it continues to snuffle around apparently looking for something

2705
06:56:24,389 --> 06:56:38,119
else to eat uh well this is where we fight use the sword you wave the plus two sword at

2706

2707
06:56:42,599 --> 06:56:50,330
irritation and tries to take a bite out of the sword hey nice one galahad oh well that didn't

2773
07:08:34,060 --> 07:08:40,299
begins to retch and cough finally it vomits up a respect for living things as well as

2774
07:08:40,299 --> 07:08:44,139
half dozen small knick-knack stores and coffee shops that was a vulgar display

2782
07:10:05,540 --> 07:10:09,860
escape even me oh good i thought i was the only one really savoring that i saw that

2783

reality 2.0 was a prison so i terminated that reality and freed its slaves anywho i'd

07:10:15,779 --> 07:10:20,580
love to stay in chat but i have got a mountain of pornography to deliver before that virus gets

2785
07:10:20,580 --> 07:10:28,330

to kick around anymore roy g-fib who's roy g-fib red green blue rgb

2788
07:10:47,669 --> 07:10:51,110
it crashed before it could transmit the most vital piece of information

2789
07:10:51,110 --> 07:10:55,830
it's the internet what did you expect good point nevertheless we'll find you

2790
07:10:55,830 --> 07:11:03,189
roy g-fib whoever you are wherever you are can it wait until after we get some lunch of course

2791
07:11:03,189 --> 07:11:06,950
there's a place over on second where they serve deep fried chocolate pork belly donuts

2792
07:11:06,950 --> 07:11:10,310
do you think we can get a discount since i'm the president of the united states

2793

good gravy are you still president so roy okay i'm gonna give you the um the low down here

2794
07:11:20,490 --> 07:11:27,529
roy g-bib is the rainbow guy red green blue i mean roy g-bib that that's like an old video

2795
07:11:27,529 --> 07:11:52,869
term i learned that in college maybe no it's not yeah that's that's what we talk i was

2796
07:11:52,869 --> 07:12:01,770
taught that in like video school it's a phonetic to remember the colors of the rainbow

2797
07:12:02,490 --> 07:12:36,790
that's rgb yeah roy g-bib rgb it means both it's too late for this shit guys i'm

2798
07:12:37,909 --> 07:12:56,709
i can't like i can't keep it up it's an old video i learned in college you learn that like

2799
07:12:56,709 --> 07:13:13,639
mr rogers like said that like 25 years ago all right so here's the deal i'm gonna go

2800
07:13:13,639 --> 07:13:19,340
over a couple scenarios with you guys did you get you baited what i can't i'm not allowed

2801
07:13:19,340 --> 07:13:23,099
to jubate i get you baited all the time i'm not allowed to throw some out there

2802
07:13:29,340 --> 07:13:39,139
so uh it is getting very late it is currently about one almost 115 am no two oh it's 2 15 am

2803
07:13:39,139 --> 07:13:50,680
eastern i think the plan will be because all right well i did it i don't want to they

2804
07:13:50,759 --> 07:14:01,189
sing the song that we don't want to hear anymore you live in vegas yeah i know but i did it's i

2805
07:14:01,189 --> 07:14:09,060
like to have my streams be not uh go that far into the night for a lot of people because

2806
07:14:09,060 --> 07:14:16,180
it's like 230 almost am eastern it's like six seven am eu or something like that

2807
07:14:19,659 --> 07:14:26,069
so let me ask you there's two options here there's either to do the last one and have

2808
07:14:26,150 --> 07:14:30,310
like a nine and a half hour stream into the night into like two three four five

2809
07:14:30,310 --> 07:14:40,869
o'clock in the morning or because i've seen what sam and max has i i like it i think it's a lot

2810
07:14:40,869 --> 07:14:43,590
of fun it's a good stream just to kick back and kind of talk and just have fun and do

2811
07:14:43,590 --> 07:14:50,950
whatever i'm going to do season two i don't there's no reason why i won't do season two

2812
07:14:55,349 --> 07:15:05,340
so we could just can we could just keep going we don't have to because of my originally

2813
07:15:05,340 --> 07:15:10,299
like earlier today and when i first played it i didn't know i'll do season one and maybe

2814
07:15:11,259 --> 07:15:25,740
it's pretty certain that i'm gonna do them all there's still another episode of season one

2815
07:15:25,740 --> 07:15:28,860
yeah i know but i feel like a lot of people want to watch it but they don't want to have

2816
07:15:28,860 --> 07:15:38,729
to stay up till four or five o'clock in the morning and then there are people that were

2817
07:15:38,729 --> 07:15:43,770
here earlier too that wanted to see it and i'd rather have more people be able to see it

2818
07:15:44,409 --> 07:15:47,689
this isn't like a simpsons hit and run scenario where i'm fucking losing my goddamn

2819
07:15:48,090 --> 07:15:50,889
freaking out and having a meltdown and forcing myself to beat the game

2820
07:15:51,610 --> 07:15:55,849
there are a lot of people that like this game i feel a lot of people like hit and run too but

2821
07:15:55,849 --> 07:16:09,209
my point is is um i might want to have people that wanted to see it be able to see it

2822
07:16:09,209 --> 07:16:15,669
because once we go there's still a ton of people here now but once we go another hour

2823
07:16:15,669 --> 07:16:24,250
or two it's going to be really really fucking late i thought i was going to be able to get

2824
07:16:24,250 --> 07:16:33,459
through it all in about six or seven hours but nope not the case if you do episode six

with us all you did was mail your router back to us in a wooden box surrounded by

2862
07:21:55,349 --> 07:22:00,069
knives and clown makeup you're still paying for our deluxe streamer package which after a

2863
07:22:00,069 --> 07:22:04,549
few months of not paying adds up to about thirteen thousand dollars we expect you to

2864
07:22:04,549 --> 07:22:10,310
pay this as soon as soon as possible or there will be legal or legal action taken against

2880
07:23:54,180 --> 07:23:59,290
what's it called if you weren't here in the beginning of the stream something wild happened

2881
07:23:59,290 --> 07:24:06,009
today at the dentist office not even really it was just in my own head i was the only

2882
07:24:06,009 --> 07:24:11,369
person that knew that was going on there were like two or three people that were around there

true same true fucking true same same by show of hands how many of people in this chat were

2999
07:41:41,990 --> 07:41:56,680
bullied because they said the word speed too many times no no no that was a fun positive

3000
07:41:56,680 --> 07:42:04,090
video and we had a good time i have good times and they don't know what the fuck they're

3001
07:42:04,090 --> 07:42:24,540
talking about all right they just didn't get it don't listen to those people my roommates

3002
07:42:24,540 --> 07:42:32,279
thought i was crazy because i was laughing at your streams well here see guys we this is funny

3003
07:42:32,279 --> 07:42:38,279
because you guys have watched the streams and videos and maybe showed them to somebody

3004
07:42:38,279 --> 07:42:42,119
and made a reference to them and they were like oh that was stupid you're stupid right

3005
07:42:42,119 --> 07:42:49,029
like as a point of reference here right i made these videos and showed them to people

3006
07:42:49,830 --> 07:42:55,880
and some of them stopped talking to me because of it remember that i told you the story about

3007
07:42:55,880 --> 07:43:01,560
that girl that i showed autos big adventure to and she literally just did not really want to

3008
07:43:01,560 --> 07:43:09,639
talk to me ever again happened to me if in real life you guys remember that story that's

3009
07:43:09,639 --> 07:43:21,880
a that's a i told that one a long time ago i was so embarrassed because how do you explain

3010
07:43:21,880 --> 07:43:27,979
to anybody it's okay so i had family come over this past week when i was gone as you

3011
07:43:27,979 --> 07:43:35,779
know i was gone for like a week in a few days and trying to one of my family members loaded up

3012
07:43:36,500 --> 07:43:42,060
the new year's eve worst of the year stream just it was the first thing that they happened

3013
07:43:42,060 --> 07:43:45,099
to click on they were like oh this is your channel i'm like yeah yeah it's my channel

3014
07:43:45,979 --> 07:43:53,639
oh and they watched it and it got to worst peter and i was just i how how would i ever

3015
07:43:53,639 --> 07:44:00,779
explain what this was he's looking over his shoulder like i don't what peter what what is

3016
07:44:00,779 --> 07:44:06,630
that peter and i'm like i said it's a kind of an in humor thing we've just it was it's hard to

3017
07:44:06,630 --> 07:44:13,779
explain the next one that comes up best impression and worst impression was about

3018
07:44:13,779 --> 07:44:18,340
me doing the 2013 youtuber he just had no fucking idea what i was talking about

3019
07:44:23,380 --> 07:44:30,819
like bugleberry like i could not describe this to my family remember i told you online media

3020
07:44:30,819 --> 07:44:37,750
because it's much easier just to be like oh yeah i uh i work like a pr guy i actually think i've

3021
07:44:37,750 --> 07:44:44,389
used that before to like a random family member i work in pr that's a complete lie

3022
07:44:46,060 --> 07:44:51,979
but hey i work in pr in media for a media company is way easier than bugleberry reading

3023
07:44:51,979 --> 07:45:10,860
scary stories that makes more sense just say influencer even that no i don't like that word

3024
07:45:13,639 --> 07:45:18,840
online entertainer comedian yeah but then went okay but remember we talked about this when you

3025
07:45:18,840 --> 07:45:25,319
start to give those details then it becomes a comedian where do you perform

3026
07:45:32,040 --> 07:45:35,799
a website what's the website well i

3027
07:45:35,799 --> 07:45:41,479
uh the website is uh it's a website online it's a streaming website

3028
07:45:42,040 --> 07:45:47,000
um what's the strength what is it what's it called what am i going to be like i'm not telling

3029
07:45:47,000 --> 07:45:54,569
you i'm not going to tell you what the website's called they would think i was doing porn you

3030
07:45:54,569 --> 07:46:00,250
work you do videos comedy video online but you won't tell me the website what are you ashamed

3031
07:46:00,250 --> 07:46:12,340
of say you work for amazon what department the uh boxing boxes oh i thought you said you were

3032
07:46:12,340 --> 07:46:22,580
a comedian yeah i'm a i tell jokes to the boxes in the storage room it's just a very difficult

3033
07:46:22,580 --> 07:46:40,150
thing to describe are you ashamed of the no i'm not ashamed of this job i love this job and

3034
07:46:40,150 --> 07:46:47,849
i don't even like to use the word job because job implies that it's i gotta go to work today

3035
07:46:49,419 --> 07:46:56,939
we've talked about me not using the term job here because once it becomes a job it gets in

3036
07:46:56,939 --> 07:47:01,740
your head and it's my job it's my i gotta go nine to five right like i gotta go i gotta do it

3037
07:47:01,740 --> 07:47:13,580
it's my job no i'm an unemployed i'm an unemployed self-reliant amazon box comedian warehouse

3038
07:47:13,580 --> 07:47:21,299
employee okay that's my title that's what i am i'm not an influencer i'm not a streamer

3039
07:47:32,380 --> 07:47:36,380
social media comedian yeah i know but explaining that to somebody that has never

3040
07:47:36,459 --> 07:47:44,090
even heard of any of this but that's what it is are we the boxes no no that's just my no

3041
07:47:46,939 --> 07:48:02,709
just say you're a receiver of donations what do you do for work i'm a receiver of donations

3042
07:48:04,040 --> 07:48:12,979
doesn't that that's like a that's that's that's panhandling you'll be able to find me uh

3043
07:48:12,979 --> 07:48:37,299
usually outside of a gas station what my job is people give me money streaming is just internet

3044
07:48:37,299 --> 07:48:44,200
panhandling no but that's not true either at least okay hold on a second at least give me like

3045
07:48:44,200 --> 07:48:53,319
a shred of credit even like a tiny bit of credit you could think that that's fine but like

3046
07:48:53,319 --> 07:49:09,270
can i get even like 10 of a credit here streaming is like being a televangelist

3047
07:49:11,299 --> 07:49:20,860
i mean okay at its very very core streaming is just televangelism kind of but no i guess

3048
07:49:20,860 --> 07:49:26,380
it's like the guy's on stage smiling he's just telling stories with a room full of people that

3049
07:49:26,380 --> 07:49:33,400
are all going to give him money fuck i really am a televangelist but i'm not i'm having this

3050
07:49:33,400 --> 07:49:41,369

3111
08:00:12,099 --> 08:00:18,310
few weeks because of my heart condition it's been okay i'm actually growing in appreciation

3112
08:00:18,310 --> 08:00:23,029
for my old self but i really do miss being able to think without being distracted and

3113
08:00:23,029 --> 08:00:27,750
cloudy all the time i was surprised when you said you had a similar experience and i'm really

3114
08:00:27,750 --> 08:00:31,990
happy that i could share my struggles with the community thanks again and fuck you

3115
08:00:32,790 --> 08:00:49,819
that's how you end that one well thanks uh but yes i uh adhd has been a struggle uh for me

3116
08:00:53,369 --> 08:01:03,459
and i remember taking medication that fucked with me so i know i kind of know what it's like

3117
08:01:04,020 --> 08:01:14,979
to have uh you know your brain and body fight back the colitis thing too i am no stranger

3118
08:01:18,810 --> 08:01:25,900
i am no stranger to medical issues and you know different stuff like that

3119
08:01:27,560 --> 08:01:42,099
so i really really hope that you can um stay managed get managed right human potty's suck

3120
08:01:44,900 --> 08:01:47,779
yeah but you know you just kind of you just have to keep doing what you can

3121
08:01:48,580 --> 08:01:54,099
you just go you do what you can you try new things try taking some medications get off of

3122
08:01:54,099 --> 08:02:03,689
them follow some you know you doctor's orders to carry yourself everybody's doing something you

3123
08:02:03,689 --> 08:02:11,380
know everybody's got something and once you once you realize that everybody where everyone's

3124
08:02:11,380 --> 08:02:16,150
like the same everyone's the fucking same everybody has like issues and problems they

3125
08:02:16,150 --> 08:02:19,189
deal with and once you know that you can relate and you can start to understand

3126
08:02:28,169 --> 08:02:36,119
no i'm perfect well that's i'm glad you are but once you get older you start to get a

3127
08:02:36,119 --> 08:02:42,569
little bit um more knowledge you start to understand what works for you and what doesn't

3128
08:02:43,130 --> 08:02:48,090
and you only find that out by trying to keep your um you know issues under control

3129
08:02:52,020 --> 08:02:55,139
well even if people laughing when i said that you get older and you get more knowledge

3130
08:02:57,930 --> 08:03:00,810
people who think they have this shit together just don't realize what's broken yet

3131
08:03:04,330 --> 08:03:11,529
yeah nobody's perfect everybody has something they do great and something they don't do so

3132
08:03:11,529 --> 08:03:18,259
great everybody has something that's potentially going on in their life and we're all in this

3133
08:03:18,259 --> 08:03:43,259
together guys we're all human beings but thank you pin i wish you the best auto is perfect

3141
08:05:09,130 --> 08:05:16,709
video footage of me speaking that's there are like 3000 videos that i've been a part of

3142
08:05:17,509 --> 08:05:22,389
i've been on stream i've said like five probably said two to three million words

3143
08:05:23,110 --> 08:05:38,060
never oh yeah this cigarettes thing i said a lot of fucked up stuff back in like 2014

3144
08:05:38,060 --> 08:05:56,779
youtube days imagine running for president don't worry piss into my own face line vaguely

3145
08:06:04,599 --> 08:06:11,799
oh the shit that i say he used to record me saying such fucking outrageous shit

3146
08:06:12,599 --> 08:06:16,200
i remember actually talking to him before being like hey man did i like

3147
08:06:16,200 --> 08:06:19,319
you're not gonna use like that of me saying that right and he was like

3148
08:06:20,279 --> 08:06:25,319
yeah i am i'm like no you can't i can't can you like not do that because it does

3149
08:06:25,319 --> 08:06:29,849
like a couple times like could you just like not remove like a couple of them i remember

3150
08:06:29,849 --> 08:06:38,630
bargaining with him while he was editing those videos he would show them to me half complete

3151
08:06:38,630 --> 08:06:43,509
and stuff we star and i used to watch each other's videos all the time before anybody

3152
08:06:43,509 --> 08:06:49,430
else did we'd be sitting at a call and we'd have you know a video that was 60 70 complete

3153
08:06:49,430 --> 08:06:52,709
and we would just watch them and be like give feedback did you think that was funny

3154
08:06:52,709 --> 08:06:55,669
or what was did you did you do not like that this part was kind of boring you should

3155
08:06:55,669 --> 08:06:59,990
probably trim that down we used to do it all the time i would do it for him and he would do

3156
08:06:59,990 --> 08:07:05,419
it for me and there was so many of those cases where it was he would show me a clip like that

3157
08:07:05,419 --> 08:07:13,720
or he'd show me like a string of clips and i'd be like uh okay um how many times did i say

3158
08:07:13,720 --> 08:07:18,040
like fuck you in that video like maybe take like three or four of like the motherfuckers

3159
08:07:18,040 --> 08:07:23,639
and fuck you because remember this is also at that turning point i used to be a channel

3160
08:07:23,720 --> 08:07:37,990
that did not swear i was a pg channel back from 2010 to 2012 i was a super pg no swears no i i tried

3161
08:07:37,990 --> 08:07:43,509
to keep it as family friendly as i could and once i crossed that that was essentially was the

3162
08:07:43,509 --> 08:07:48,549
crossover me saying i was gonna eat shit out of the toilet was the ultimate crossover because

3163
08:07:48,549 --> 08:07:54,939
why are you ever gonna go back hey guys uh welcome to germa 985 we're gonna be playing

3164
08:07:54,939 --> 08:08:01,180
minecraft oh crap i just dropped my shovel oh oh doo doo i literally just talked about pissing

3165
08:08:01,180 --> 08:08:07,369
into my own face on somebody else's video those videos that he made were sort of like the

3166
08:08:08,009 --> 08:08:11,209
the entryway for meats to be like all right well fucking whatever who cares

3167
08:08:12,169 --> 08:08:28,950
i'm not gonna do that anymore i miss family friendly jerma imagine imagine watching sesame

3168
08:08:28,950 --> 08:08:33,990
street and then after years of being kid friendly big bird just starts yelling about

3169
08:08:33,990 --> 08:08:51,799
putting cigarettes out on his dick oh my god i wasn't kid friendly though i was i just didn't

3170
08:08:51,799 --> 08:09:01,319
use any vulgarities right i wasn't like a child family like i wasn't a family video maker i

3171
08:09:01,319 --> 08:09:06,119
played like m rated games i talked about like kind of screwed up stuff but i didn't ever

3172
08:09:09,349 --> 08:09:16,869
subscriber friendly i'm gonna go watch it back and watch those videos it's it it's probably the

3173
08:09:16,869 --> 08:09:22,540
first 50 to 100 videos i made no no no that's not even true that's not true no no that's not

3174
08:09:22,540 --> 08:09:29,939
true the first the first like 20 videos i made i didn't give a shit and said anything because

3175
08:09:29,939 --> 08:09:35,619
i didn't think anyone was gonna watch my videos so there's this weird period where the

3176
08:09:35,619 --> 08:09:43,799
first 20 to 30 videos on germa 985 are just no filter i'm saying just wicked stupid

3177
08:09:43,799 --> 08:09:49,290
shit and like swearing and don't give a fuck right and once i realized people were watching

3178
08:09:49,930 --> 08:09:55,590
and i started to get an audience it was like wait a minute i kind of who is what i got i kind

3179
08:09:55,590 --> 08:10:00,150
of probably have to clean my act up a little bit i i can't tell people like to fuck off and

3180
08:10:00,150 --> 08:10:04,630
in the game and stuff no no no i all right i'm gonna like clean it up a little bit and then

3181
08:10:04,709 --> 08:10:17,020
from like video number 40 to video number like 150 was clean cut pg jeremy and then the flood gates

3182
08:10:17,020 --> 08:10:32,279
opened and here we are did you delete and unlist these videos no they're all still there no

3183
08:10:32,279 --> 08:10:48,470
they're they're they're all there i feel like you were still vulgar in 2012 well because

3184
08:10:48,470 --> 08:10:55,110
remember 2011 was when i was really starting to do it for real i made a lot of videos in

3185
08:10:55,110 --> 08:11:06,009
2011 into 2012 it had to have been at least 50 to 100 videos i remember all okay here's a good

3186
08:11:06,009 --> 08:11:13,110
indicator my entire super meat boy playthrough if you didn't know that i have a full super

3187
08:11:13,110 --> 08:11:21,419
meat boy playthrough on my channel the whole thing i don't i was making sure i didn't swear

3188
08:11:21,419 --> 08:11:32,950
during that whole thing so when was that 2011 2012 never finished the dark world no i didn't

3189
08:11:32,950 --> 08:11:42,180
not on the camera you gotta watch him now yeah i think i actually maybe say one or two swears

3190
08:11:42,180 --> 08:11:53,110
but they're like ah shit oh and i correct myself oh it's weird i've been around for
