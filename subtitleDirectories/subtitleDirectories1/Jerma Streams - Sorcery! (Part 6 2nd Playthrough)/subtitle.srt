1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:06,980
I'm going to lower the volume so it's not horrible.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:20,780
Can one of the mods make the game, uh, sorcery?

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,370
It ends June 26th at 10 a.m. Oh.

4
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,300
All right. But the demos aren't going away, right?

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,619
If I get some more of them. Or maybe they are.

6
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:42,460
Hey, you haven't seen this in a very long time.

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,710
Most of them are. Some of them, but not all of them.

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,460
All right. So. Hello everybody. Welcome back to sorcery.

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,560
This is technically the third part. This is episode three of sorcery.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,469
Let's go over this. Probably. I think there's a lot of new viewers here over the last year.

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,620
I would highly recommend you go watch the sorcery part one and part two.

12
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,780
We're technically on the third game.

13
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,590
If you want a quick recap, I can give it to you.

14
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:33,109
But I need a recap too. This is a choose your own adventure game.

15
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:37,140
It's based on a series of books by Steve Jackson.

16
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,379
Steve Jackson made a ton of choose your own adventure books.

17
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,469
This series is one of them. Wildly seen as the best in all of the.

18
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:50,230
Well, that's subjective.

19
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,439
But of all the books that Steve Jackson did.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,590
This is considered to be a really the good ones. The really good ones.

21
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,959
You can buy these books. These books still exist.

22
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:14,840
But this company, Inkle, took all the books and made them into a full complete board game.

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,439
Where all the choices are the same.

24
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,159
It's pretty much a one to one reimagining of the whole thing.

25
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,300
There's a lot of choices.

26
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,620
The choices matter a lot in this game.

27
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,469
You can screw up big time.

28
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:32,229
We had a thing where the amount of Ruwa.

29
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:33,110
Who is he talking to?

30
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,830
My mother's on speaker right now.

31
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:38,069
She's muted.

32
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,430
But come on. I'm trying to tell.

33
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,240
My mother wants to catch up.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,039
Still there, Ma?

35
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,090
All right. Yep.

36
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:51,240
So Ma, when you last saw, we were in the Baklans.

37
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,210
These are the Baklans.

38
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,409
The first two episodes.

39
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:56,810
I saw spoilers, by the way, if you don't want to miss any of it.

40
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,060
If you want to see the whole thing as it played out.

41
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,740
Very high quality entertainment.

42
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,740
Really, really engaging stuff.

43
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,520
I recommend you watch it.

44
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,879
But if you don't care and you're just like,

45
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,740
I just want to see the guy click on stuff.

46
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,139
The last thing that we did, we got.

47
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:14,199
We are the Annalander.

48
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,939
Our goal is to go get the Crown of Kings.

49
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,919
The Crown of Kings is the most powerful artifact in the world.

50
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,360
It has the power to do anything.

51
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,939
Essentially, you're turning on god powers if you have the crown.

52
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,419
The Archmage, who is the main antagonist of the game, has the crown.

53
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,490
Stole it.

54
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,580
We need to get it back.

55
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,370
We went through treacherous shit.

56
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:46,889
We are currently going through the Baklans.

57
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:54,360
Interestingly enough, there are assassins now trying to kill us.

58
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,139
In episode three, in the third game, your goal is to get through all of the Baklans

59
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,020
and killing and taking the essence of all of the serpents.

60
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,620
There are seven serpents and they are trying to kill me.

61
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,780
We have already killed one or two of them.

62
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,839
I forget who they were.

63
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:27,100
The Final Fantasy 16 panel is still up.

64
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,389
Sorry, Square Enix was really good to me, so they can stay.

65
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:38,680
Square Enix was wonderful to work with, so I mean...

66
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:50,379
Anyways, anyways, we're going to just see what the last few things were.

67
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,250
So we were talking to somebody.

68
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,230
There's time travel.

69
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,389
Keep up.

70
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:03,110
Each one of these devices, there are two full maps in this game.

71
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,550
One of them is in the past.

72
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,149
The other one is in the present.

73
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:10,459
We need to go back to the past, moving these units around.

74
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:15,100
Wherever these units shine in that cone is in the past.

75
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:17,819
Can you follow?

76
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:18,220
Keep up.

77
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,990
Come on, Gwen.

78
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,670
We need to go find some serpents in the past.

79
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,069
Keep up.

80
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:28,180
Come on, Gwen.

81
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,300
The last thing that just happened...

82
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,620
Actually, let me play one of the best songs ever recorded.

83
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,740
Let's do that first.

84
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,860
Let's take a look at some of the spells.

85
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,220
We're just doing a recap, I know.

86
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,660
Some of you are probably like, all right, fuck this guy.

87
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,379
I'm out of here.

88
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:41,860
That's all right.

89
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,180
That's fine.

90
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,819
We'll see you later.

91
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:52,040
If you're wondering where the sus command is from, it's not because I'm the fucking sus guy.

92
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:53,779
That's not what it is.

93
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,079
This is from seven or eight years ago.

94
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,480
Sus is a command.

95
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,600
It's a spell in sorcery.

96
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,290
There are dozens of spells that you can do in most scenarios.

97
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,410
They give you pretty good options.

98
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,389
Stuff like jig.

99
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:19,180
When cast, the recipient will get an uncontrollable urge to dance.

100
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,060
This works.

101
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,500
You can do these to pretty much anybody.

102
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,209
There it is.

103
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:29,459
It's sense danger is the name of the spell.

104
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:30,579
That's where it's originally from.

105
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:37,160
Could you please say Steve Jackson's sorcery in your sorcery voice?

106
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,639
Yeah.

107
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:49,959
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the third episode of Steve Jackson's sorcery.

108
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,980
There you go.

109
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,939
You can use that wherever you want.

110
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:00,089
I want the song to replay though.

111
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:06,540
Oh, we have a god too.

112
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,339
We have spirits.

113
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:12,300
So right now you can pray to your spirit.

114
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,839
Our spirit right now is the ape.

115
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,699
If we're in a bad scenario, something bad is happening.

116
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:20,899
Oh my god.

117
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:21,939
I don't know what to do here.

118
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:25,540
They give you an option to pray to your spirit.

119
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,500
Sometimes they listen.

120
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,420
Sometimes they don't.

121
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,100
Sometimes they actually think it's funny when something bad is happening to you.

122
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,800
Depends on who you have.

123
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,199
There are dozens and dozens, if not thousands.

124
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,240
It's probably like 10.

125
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,149
We have the ape right now.

126
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:42,230
Strong beast, intelligent, and prudent.

127
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,810
Who takes great pride in acting faithfully to be depended on.

128
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,660
So we can depend on the ape.

129
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,540
Sometimes it's like the scorpion or the panther.

130
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,620
And they have different things that they do.

131
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,540
You can also pray to heal.

132
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,579
We have 29 gold.

133
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,579
I have three stamina.

134
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,459
Why don't we take a look at the...

135
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,139
This is the song.

136
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,439
Clues.

137
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:13,269
All right.

138
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:15,350
We need to read some of these because it's been a long time.

139
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,029
The seven serpents weaknesses.

140
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,000
They all have a weakness.

141
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,899
The seven serpents threaten your journey.

142
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,259
But they carry a message that will warn the archmage of your coming.

143
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,740
But each has a weakness that if discovered will allow you to destroy them.

144
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,059
Okay.

145
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,879
I think we just start moving.

146
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,019
We...

147
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:40,779
You know?

148
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,220
Thankfully we can see where we've been.

149
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,379
So the last thing that happened was...

150
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:51,190
What was the last thing?

151
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,990
Dentainter.

152
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,029
Dentainter of the steps.

153
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:53,509
They call me...

154
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:55,370
Wait, wasn't this a serpent?

155
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,009
I intend to kill the seven serpents who tell her and she laughs.

156
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,690
Many have had that intention.

157
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,259
Very few know their weaknesses.

158
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,220
But you know them.

159
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,269
The serpent's weaknesses are the most heavily guarded secrets in the whole of Mampang.

160
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,110
She replies dramatically before smiling.

161
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,909
Of course I know them.

162
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,350
Or at least I know of two.

163
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,500
Your mom's still on the phone?

164
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,059
Oh.

165
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,480
All right, ma, I gotta go.

166
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,389
You caught up?

167
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:20,710
She said yes with a smiley emoji.

168
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,590
All right, perfect.

169
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,750
All right, I'll talk to you soon.

170
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,549
Okay.

171
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,379
Bye, ma.

172
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,850
Say hi to dad.

173
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,220
Bye, ma.

174
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,720
Okay.

175
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,980
What else do you know?

176
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,379
I know that your lack of gratitude is unbecoming.

177
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,700
And I shall transform you into a toad.

178
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,509
Tell me of the Sleepless Ram.

179
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,659
The Sleepless Ram is in Mampang Fortress, a guardian of the Archmage.

180
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,559
All right.

181
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,600
It has a weakness.

182
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,519
Where can I find the seven serpents?

183
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,080
One goes...

184
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,620
Okay, one goes off to hide in the waters of Lake Iklala.

185
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,860
It means to pick you off as you cross.

186
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,340
But it will wait until you are alone.

187
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,019
If you travel with the ferrymen, you will most likely be safe.

188
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,299
She shakes her head.

189
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,860
If that's not any help, I don't suppose it is.

190
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,379
What kind of sorceress are you?

191
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,340
You ask.

192
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,059
A busy one.

193
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,860
Why do you waste my time with stupid questions?

194
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,309
She turns to leave, begins to weave her spell around herself once more.

195
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:23,690
You waive her away, keen to continue your journey.

196
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,929
Dentainte becomes an ugly creature once more.

197
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:30,730
And a moment later, she whisks herself away across the plains and is gone.

198
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,490
Climb is uneventful and the slopes are silent.

199
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,009
You have found three new clues.

200
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,480
All right.

201
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:43,450
So we've got further up, we've got across the plain, and then we have downhill.

202
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,529
I am going to say, let's go this way.

203
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,870
Forest of, we've, we have not, we've explored a lot of this.

204
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,429
Some of it in the past, some in the present.

205
00:10:55,429 --> 00:11:00,570
But I think it's time to go through the Forest of Snata.

206
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,929
So they mean to jump me in Lake Iklala.

207
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:04,889
I need to remember that.

208
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:07,460
Let's go for it.

209
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,340
Here we go.

210
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,539
Time to begin.

211
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,220
You return up the winding path to the top of the mountain.

212
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,299
Night falls and you are worn out.

213
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:24,789
You should try to find somewhere safe to sleep.

214
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:29,429
From the top of the mountain, the view across the plains in both directions is gloomy and dark.

215
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:32,250
But you see no way down to the east.

216
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,610
There is nowhere on the exposed peak to sleep safely.

217
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,139
You must keep walking.

218
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,659
Time to head for lower ground.

219
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:41,210
All right.

220
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:49,429
Broken down bridge, down the steps.

221
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:52,470
We can go this way, but no, let's, let's go for it.

222
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,029
Okay.

223
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,830
You step onto the foot of the ruined bridge and then over.

224
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,230
You drop a few feet to the slope below in a controlled fashion.

225
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,830
And then you begin to skid, sliding and slipping down the loose stones.

226
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,330
You are gathering speed fast.

227
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,450
You are falling.

228
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:17,379
Your boots shoot out from underneath you and you skid down the slope on your cloak.

229
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:19,779
Arms out backwards, trying to keep you level.

230
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:22,500
You're about halfway to the thick trees below.

231
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Concentrate on balance.

232
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,070
Pray to the ape or cast a spell.

233
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,750
Keep in mind, this is very important.

234
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,149
Mom, I know you're not there anymore, but it's all right.

235
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:39,299
Casting spells costs stamina between one and three.

236
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,539
If I cast a spell, I will die.

237
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,379
I think we do have to pray to the ape.

238
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,980
Let's see if the ape will help us.

239
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,350
Pray.

240
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,029
To pray, you need to close your eyes despite the rushing wind, the scattering stones,

241
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:55,990
the sudden precipices that come and go.

242
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,950
Close my eyes.

243
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,799
Despite the skidding rocks, you close your eyes and begin to raise a prayer to the ape.

244
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,639
You feel the stones either side slowing themselves, just a little.

245
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:11,210
From a blur to a mere streak, the canopy approaches at speed.

246
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:17,820
I think it worked.

247
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:27,700
You hit the ground slowly and cannot help but give thanks to the ape for your salvation.

248
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,100
I would pray for healing right now, but I want to keep.

249
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,759
If you pray for healing, they'll go away for an extended period.

250
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,299
It's kind of like a oh shit button.

251
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,179
Sometimes it doesn't work.

252
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:42,059
That's actually surprising.

253
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:44,970
That's good that it worked.

254
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,659
All right, let's look back.

255
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,460
You cast a look back at the mountain slope, but it is all but sheer.

256
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:52,779
There's no way to climb it again.

257
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,460
You'll have to move onwards.

258
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,179
You pick yourself to your feet.

259
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,220
You're on the edge of the thick trees with no discernible path forward.

260
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,700
You'll have to fight through the trees as best as you can.

261
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:05,750
All right, so here we are.

262
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,470
I guess we're going to keep heading this way.

263
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,049
You barge your way through thick trees.

264
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:18,330
Can you guys hear the background music?

265
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,529
Pretty sick desktop reveal.

266
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,860
Default windows, Andy.

267
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,690
Okay, nice wallpaper.

268
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:31,830
I hear, yeah, I hear it.

269
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:35,370
Just the music gets a little loud, so just keep that in mind.

270
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,450
I guess the mixing is a little off.

271
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,470
Nice wallpaper, default windows wallpaper.

272
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,940
Tell that wallpaper story again.

273
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,059
What, that I just don't, I just make it something and don't use it?

274
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,100
I don't change it ever again.

275
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,960
All right, you barge your way through the thick trees, pushing branches from your face.

276
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,039
Things chitter in the leaves all around.

277
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,279
All right, I'm going to keep moving.

278
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,789
You crash on through the thick foliage.

279
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:05,500
Only one way to go.

280
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:15,269
You erupt from the trees onto an old path that winds a narrow course through the forest.

281
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:17,909
The trees loom around you, twisted and old.

282
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:22,259
You explored the forest in the Xumantanti Hills when you met Aliana,

283
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,779
but that was a mere copse in comparison to this.

284
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,919
The forest is ancient.

285
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,120
The forest of Snata is ancient and it is a maze.

286
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,179
There are no roads through it, only twisted paths and dead ends.

287
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:38,940
But who knows what secrets it may hide.

288
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,740
The forest by night is a terrifying place full of strange noises and shifting shadows.

289
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:51,690
You are certain something is following you, but when you turn, there is nothing there.

290
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,809
I've played this game before.

291
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,809
I know what it is.

292
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:55,929
I know what it is.

293
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:58,250
I think.

294
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,210
Uh, I think I need to do this though, but do I have enough?

295
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,429
Do I have any healing potions?

296
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,100
We still, oh, we have a lot of goblin teeth, giant teeth.

297
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,940
We have a lot of the good magic items.

298
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,379
So most of the spells in the game you cannot cast unless you have a magical item.

299
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,870
These are kind of hard to come by and we did a really good job.

300
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:35,179
But I don't think I have any, how many heals do I?

301
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:41,669
I need to cook.

302
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,500
Tell the orchestra to stop.

303
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:54,259
That's what I mean by the mixing and the audio mixing is a little off

304
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,779
because the music is fantastic.

305
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,950
But if I lower this, then everything else will be lower.

306
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,570
It's all right.

307
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,929
It's it's and it's beautiful.

308
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,210
We're going to keep going.

309
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,170
All right, we're going for it.

310
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,319
This is going to be loud.

311
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,200
That part always is.

312
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,079
Just keep that in mind.

313
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,630
All right, we can do Yaz, which is cause invisibility.

314
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,990
We can do all which is floating the air.

315
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,349
However, I think something's behind me.

316
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,309
There is obviously sus, which is sense danger.

317
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:44,950
The sun would just create light.

318
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,900
I think we have to do it just because, right?

319
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:55,450
You cast the enchantment and a calm voice begins to speak to you.

320
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,420
This part of the forest is thick with snattercats.

321
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,970
They're invisible unless they have their eyes open.

322
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:06,579
Their sense of smell is good enough to track you down.

323
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:14,980
I think we keep moving.

324
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:16,579
I have two health.

325
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:23,099
You pick up your pace if you walk for long enough after all the sun will rise.

326
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,529
It's decision time.

327
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:29,259
Where are we going?

328
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:30,740
VODs?

329
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,140
Put a two-minute poll up.

330
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,940
Are we going east or are we going south?

331
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,440
Very different directions considering this is going to have us go all over here.

332
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This one's going to have us go all over here.

333
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,759
Keep in mind this is very important.

334
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,170
How many choices are in the game really?

335
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,930
A fuckload.

336
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,779
A shitload.

337
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:01,670
So it's not like, oh, okay, this probably all connects to the same thing.

338
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,220
A lot.

339
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:14,390
That doesn't mean you can swear.

340
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,180
Oh yeah, when we play sorcery I gotta go PG-13 mode.

341
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,680
You're right.

342
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,150
Pretty much 50-50.

343
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:28,500
Every time I click out of here you're going to see my background but it's all right.

344
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,819
It is 50-50.

345
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,619
That means it's streamer's choice by the way.

346
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,289
50-50 is streamer's choice.

347
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:55,769
The game is like Elden Ring but you're not allowed to leave the map screen.

348
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,690
Time that person out for six or seven months.

349
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,970
All right, where are we going?

350
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,180
Maybe we'll make all the polls 60 seconds.

351
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,829
We're not going to do a poll for every single choice.

352
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:22,549
I'm just, you know, showing that sometimes we do it.

353
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,059
You ever beat this one the tryhard way?

354
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:33,140
No, every time I've ever played sorcery again I kind of just casually play it.

355
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,619
I don't ever do any like the meta or like...

356
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,779
I know there's a way you can get them all pretty quickly.

357
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,839
Is it still 50-50?

358
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,880
Well, something has to win.

359
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,240
There's no such thing as a tie on this switch poll.

360
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,130
Which way?

361
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,259
Okay, south it is.

362
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,460
Thanks for playing.

363
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,359
You walk on between the trees.

364
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,039
The dead of night is still in cold.

365
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,440
Something prowls close at hand.

366
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,000
Suddenly you catch a pair of eyes in a low bush.

367
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,230
Look at the eyes.

368
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,789
Oh, all right.

369
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:12,309
This is a snatacat.

370
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:16,630
I think we need to just...

371
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:17,829
I don't know.

372
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,950
I'm going to look.

373
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:25,930
The artwork is amazing in this, by the way.

374
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,490
They pull it.

375
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,089
Essentially, they rip it right from the books.

376
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,680
The eyes are narrow with thin vertical pupils and orange irises.

377
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,920
A moment later, another pair of eyes appear followed slowly by a body.

378
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,440
These creatures are becoming visible as you watch.

379
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
These must be snatacats.

380
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,519
There they are.

381
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:54,630
Look at them.

382
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,190
Keep walking.

383
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,430
All right.

384
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,950
What if I just keep looking at them?

385
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,980
I'm going to look at them more.

386
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:07,619
They are both the size of a large dog with ugly snub noses.

387
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:11,779
Their black fur is trimmed with yellow flashes.

388
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:16,809
One of the creatures steps out of the bushes to stand in front of you, then vanishes.

389
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:18,500
Oh, shit.

390
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:20,740
Maybe just listen.

391
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:23,990
You listen.

392
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:28,740
Footsteps across the leaves and branches cannot be disguised.

393
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:37,450
The cats are pacing towards you.

394
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:37,950
Wow.

395
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:40,069
What can I do here?

396
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,069
Rock.

397
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,970
Turn to stone.

398
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:46,650
I don't have any stone dust.

399
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,960
Gob.

400
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:53,059
So I'm on a goblin.

401
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:55,859
This is free, by the way.

402
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,779
This does not cost stamina.

403
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,420
We might get a goblin friend to come help us.

404
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,230
Gack is cause fear.

405
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,349
I don't have the face mask.

406
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,200
Gum is glue.

407
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,480
I don't have glue.

408
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,920
I think we have to have a goblin come out.

409
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,279
It's free and I only have two.

410
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,680
Yeah, all these are going to cost at least one.

411
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,200
This one's three.

412
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,880
Yeah, let's see what a goblin is going to do here.

413
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,440
I have five goblin teeth, so we're good.

414
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,480
Let's let it roll.

415
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,450
You pull a goblin tooth from your pack and drop it on the ground, casting your spell across it.

416
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,089
The tooth erupts into a column of smoke and a moment later, a goblin warrior is standing in

417
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:37,779
front of you.

418
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:41,380
Order the goblin to attack or hide behind the goblin.

419
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,349
Attack!

420
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:48,549
You direct the goblin forward, ordering it to draw its sword.

421
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:52,630
But the goblin is stupid and does not realize the Snatacat is even there.

422
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,730
A moment later, your little champion is dead in the mud.

423
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,369
Its little throat slit.

424
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:02,329
The body disappears in a puff of smoke and you draw your sword.

425
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:04,009
I shouldn't.

426
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,450
Okay, this is bad.

427
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,329
So there is combat in this game.

428
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:13,849
For those of you that need to understand how this works, I will give a very brief overview.

429
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:21,450
It's just like bluffing the video game because I have a stamina bar that's nine points.

430
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:24,170
Snatacat has a stamina bar that's seven points.

431
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,819
No, it's also it's probably eight because look at how big it is.

432
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,200
So how this works is if I hit defend, I won't do anything.

433
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:42,819
If this character attacks, I will always take one damage.

434
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:43,220
I will.

435
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,660
Yeah, this is health.

436
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,019
Stamina is health in this game.

437
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,779
This is like a different bar.

438
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,099
So some people's bars are this tall.

439
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:51,460
Some people have this big.

440
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,150
Some people this is going to be hard.

441
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:59,509
So again, I have to make sure that if I am going to do this,

442
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:03,289
that it will be higher than what they do.

443
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:07,369
So if I go, okay, I'm going to go four point one for strength

444
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:12,009
and the Snatacat does four point two, I lose and I take damage and it'll kill me

445
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:15,450
because it's going to do like three or four damage.

446
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,500
If I defend, it'll always be one damage I take if they attack two.

447
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,400
Now, here's a very important thing to realize.

448
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,359
If I go full blast, it'll be fine.

449
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:37,369
But then my bar is zero when the bar, it takes a few turns to recharge this.

450
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,369
So you can really get yourself in a lot of trouble.

451
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,420
I'm going to say it's one V one.

452
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:46,309
It's going to be I'm going full blast.

453
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,470
And it was a stupid idea because I just burnt how I almost my whole stamina bar

454
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,940
and I did nothing because the cat's invisible.

455
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,259
You can't even see it.

456
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,130
The Snatacat stares hard at you, then close its eyes and vanishes.

457
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,970
You take a risk and charge head on.

458
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,730
Okay, I'm dead in one hit.

459
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,259
Your caution pays off as the slavering cat appears suddenly diving for your blood.

460
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:25,740
Eyes wide open now staring with murderous intent.

461
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:29,019
You react on instinct, dodging behind a tree for cover.

462
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:31,369
You're shaken, but mostly unharmed.

463
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:33,210
The Snatacat closes its eyes once more.

464
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,619
You see it is tensing, preparing to pounce.

465
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:38,819
I got to go full blast on this.

466
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,140
Yep, got him.

467
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,619
Good.

468
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:51,130
Okay, I am I need to pray to the ape.

469
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,690
We're good.

470
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,369
All right, I got five health from that.

471
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,130
He he's going to go away now, but I prayed to the ape.

472
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:57,769
Everything's good.

473
00:26:59,259 --> 00:26:59,980
I have more health.

474
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:04,569
If something bad happens later, then that's just the way it is.

475
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:05,529
All right, what did he do last?

476
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:06,650
Like four.

477
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,400
How much bar does he have?

478
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm going.

479
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:15,380
Okay, this is going to be a huge full bar attack.

480
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:19,609
Snatacat does not reappear and your blade finds only empty air.

481
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:20,410
All right, now I defend.

482
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,220
Oh, okay.

483
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:25,700
Nothing else happens.

484
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,099
You wait, eyes fixed on the empty air again.

485
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:28,980
Yep.

486
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,210
Okay, Snatacat runs for your throat.

487
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,779
Quick as a flash, you leap out of the way, but you cannot defend forever.

488
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,259
All right, Snatacat just use full stamina bar.

489
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,259
I'm going to defend.

490
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:50,730
You stay crouched.

491
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,049
You sense the Snatacat prowling.

492
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:54,410
It is somewhere very close.

493
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,650
You can almost feel its hot, wet breath.

494
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,950
You think it appears?

495
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,190
I'm going, I'm going all in.

496
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,900
Got it.

497
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,299
You bring all your strength to bear on the creature's hide.

498
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:14,259
The Snatacat turns on the spot, prowling the space between you.

499
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,069
Snatacat fades from view as it turns about on the spot.

500
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:18,789
I'm going in again.

501
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,470
See you later.

502
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:22,309
Only one damage?

503
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:22,549
What?

504
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:27,910
Its fur seems to bristle with electricity.

505
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,869
You turn your grip about for a wild attack and the blow lands deep.

506
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,900
Snatacat wails in agony with a keying, keening, almost human sound.

507
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,619
Do I dare?

508
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,160
Oh, I did it.

509
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,839
With .1 damage.

510
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:46,359
I got it.

511
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,759
Nice.

512
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:49,640
You risk a swipe.

513
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,960
Your sword plunges deep into the creature's throat.

514
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,119
It drops to the ground and those delicate, powerful eyelids close.

515
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,849
Continue.

516
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:03,420
The other Snatacats prowl closer, slowly circling around you.

517
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,150
Uh-oh, do I got to do this a few times?

518
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,029
Do I continue or do I fight or do I just try to get out?

519
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:12,809
Fight the next one.

520
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:13,210
Let's go.

521
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,980
You pick the next closest creature and ready your attack.

522
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,019
The remaining Snatacats look between each other.

523
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:23,190
Then close their eyes and vanish from view.

524
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,829
The leaves rustle as they disappear into the trees.

525
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:28,890
Oh, cowards.

526
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,339
Pry loose the dead cat's teeth.

527
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,140
Yeah, this is probably going to be magical items here.

528
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:40,059
Working with the tip of your blade, you pry free the creature's front two incisor teeth.

529
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:44,710
It's bloody work and once done, that grass underfoot is sodden.

530
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,309
Then there's nothing more to do.

531
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:49,509
You walk away, wiping invisible blood from your blade.

532
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:53,269
Something massive looms between the trees south of here.

533
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:56,599
You must continue your journey.

534
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,759
But you are weaker than you realize.

535
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:04,869
Perhaps you should simply rest here for a few hours and regain some strength.

536
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,509
Yeah.

537
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:13,180
Gratefully, you seat yourself and enter the meditative state taught to you by your masters.

538
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,180
A sensation of great peace enters your body.

539
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,900
Hours pass.

540
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,319
In the distance, the sun breaks over the horizon.

541
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,359
You've been awake all night and are weaker for it.

542
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:29,299
You stand once more.

543
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:30,579
Day eight in the forest.

544
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,420
During the past day, you reached the forest of Snata

545
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,460
and you defeated the moon serpent, the first of the seven serpents.

546
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,819
We did beat the moon serpent.

547
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,779
Did it take my stamina away?

548
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,099
All right, well, obviously we're going to keep going south.

549
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:46,460
We're not going to go back up that way.

550
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,720
You follow what might be a path and it might be an old river

551
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,079
through the trees of the forest.

552
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,960
As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.

553
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,069
You are standing in the shadow of some colossal stone structure

554
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:03,180
that rises up from the trees and disappears into the clouds.

555
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,539
You stride forward.

556
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:09,430
You must reach Iklala and the road to lower Zamen.

557
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,269
Every passing day brings danger.

558
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:20,660
That bird is fucking loud.

559
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,299
Things rustle in the branches all around.

560
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:29,380
As the sun climbs towards its zenith, the wind picks up.

561
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,799
You emerge into something of a clearing with a stone pillar at its heart.

562
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,359
Not a tower, but one leg of an enormous arch.

563
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,400
Who could have built such an incredible thing?

564
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,000
And how long ago was it done?

565
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:53,859
The trees are thinner, replaced by climbing weeds and shrubs

566
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:56,420
that grow in and around the broken stones of the bridge.

567
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,410
You make your way to a point where the path splits.

568
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,529
Look up at the arch.

569
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:05,000
You crane your neck back to look at the stone pillar.

570
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,640
Made of bricks, each one of a normal size, but thousands upon thousands in number.

571
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,210
They climb up into the air and a stack, no wider than a tree,

572
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,589
but three times taller than the tallest in the forest.

573
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:20,200
Look higher.

574
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,160
Then, almost beyond what you can see, the stone begins to form a curve,

575
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,839
branching into the beginning of an arch.

576
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:29,559
But the rest of the arch has crumbled into ruin,

577
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:32,230
and this single leg is all that remains.

578
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:38,869
The pillar might be climbable, otherwise several paths lead into the trees.

579
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:41,400
All right, this is where it's going to get funky.

580
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,369
We're not leaving.

581
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,410
Climb the pillar.

582
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,609
But what is that going to put us?

583
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:53,740
So we started here.

584
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,940
We couldn't go across.

585
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,869
This will get us on the top of the bridge.

586
00:32:56,869 --> 00:33:01,019
Is there anything on the top of the bridge that's important?

587
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:03,660
Or do we just simply go down here?

588
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:09,259
Pray to the ape.

589
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:10,299
I can't, I already did.

590
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,980
Yeah, whatever, let's climb it.

591
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,140
Intrigued, you approach one of the brick pillars to see if it might be climbable.

592
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,380
Indeed, the stones are worn and filled with pock-marked holes and finger grips.

593
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,609
But you cannot seem to manage the climb up while holding your sword.

594
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:33,450
You will have to unbuckle your blade if you want to climb up.

595
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,420
What do I have for a weapon?

596
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,210
Because if I lose this, I'm going to be fucking really mad.

597
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:44,869
Okay, I have a hewing axe.

598
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:53,240
I don't want to lose any items.

599
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:03,099
Sorry, it's just a generic sword.

600
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,559
I think the axe is the more important one, though.

601
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,300
All right, let's go.

602
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,590
Fine.

603
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:16,150
You unbuckle your weapon and leave them in a tidy pile at the foot of the pillar,

604
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,389
covering them up with large leaves.

605
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,090
Then you begin to climb.

606
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,179
The going is tough, and once you start,

607
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,619
you begin to understand quite how tall the stone pillar is.

608
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:31,050
You've barely reached the forest canopy when you need to stop for breath.

609
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,730
And at the same time, you are not even a third of the way to the top of the arch.

610
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,380
I have an opportunity to stop doing this.

611
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,579
We don't have the ape anymore.

612
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:45,829
Keep that in mind.

613
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:46,550
You keep climbing.

614
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,760
After five more minutes, your arms are aching with the effort.

615
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,960
But you have an incredible view across the forest.

616
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,880
It fills this basin from the mountains in the east to those in the west.

617
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,800
Its canopy is so tightly self-entwined, it is almost like a sea.

618
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,900
The top of the bridge is still some distance above you.

619
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:13,400
Okay.

620
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,239
You climb even higher until your arms begin to scream with pain.

621
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:22,889
You are so high up now that to drop would not simply be fatal.

622
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:26,710
It would be enough to bury you six feet into the earth.

623
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,110
Before your arms give out, you swing yourself into one of the bridge's levels to rest.

624
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,510
Some wily coyote shit.

625
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,710
I'm losing stamina, too.

626
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,590
That's not good.

627
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,150
All right, rest.

628
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,179
This is a lower roadway, one layer down from the top of the bridge.

629
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:50,420
Perhaps this was used for servants or goods trucks when the road above was for nobles.

630
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,139
At any rate, there seems to be no stairs or ramps to the higher level,

631
00:35:55,139 --> 00:36:03,849
but the view is incredible through the bridge.

632
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:07,289
You pause to admire the arches holding up the layer above.

633
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,659
Graceful giant stones stacked with unearing precision.

634
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:15,780
Whoever built this must have been three times the size of the largest hill giant,

635
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,079
and yet as dexterous as a weaver.

636
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,559
Scratched into the stone, you see a small insignia.

637
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:31,210
The wind blasts through the arches for a moment, making a fluting, moaning sound.

638
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,699
Whoa.

639
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:33,099
Looking...

640
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:41,349
Okay, what does it say?

641
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:47,340
The emblem forms the shape of a jagged peak.

642
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,659
You recognize it, of course, from your training.

643
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:57,239
It is the jagged rocks of High Xamen, on which stands the fortress of the archmage.

644
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,960
These stones were set by Xamen magic then.

645
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,239
It is said the archmage is old, but surely not so old as to have overseen this.

646
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:07,800
Something rustles in the weeds nearby.

647
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,820
Watch out the weeds!

648
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,739
You approach the bushes, then freeze.

649
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:15,579
A pair of eyes is staring back.

650
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:16,079
Uh-oh.

651
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,539
Jump off the bridge?

652
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:28,179
But what if it...

653
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,099
Okay, what if it's not a snatacat?

654
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:35,110
Jump off the bridge, I dare you.

655
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,230
You are trapped up here.

656
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,829
No way to escape and no way to fight.

657
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,900
There is little choice but to jump.

658
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,440
So without thinking too hard, you turn and fling yourself over the side.

659
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,039
It is a long way to fall.

660
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,889
You hit the ground with a neck-twisting thump.

661
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:58,489
You have fallen to your death.

662
00:37:58,489 --> 00:37:59,210
Game over.

663
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:07,559
All right, that was for fun.

664
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,840
That was for a joke.

665
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,159
We go back.

666
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:18,469
We're going back.

667
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:23,579
There is a rewind feature.

668
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:24,460
No rewinds.

669
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,579
Yeah, we...

670
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:27,480
Okay.

671
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,739
What's the rule for this playthrough here?

672
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:30,219
I forgot.

673
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:34,260
I think it was three.

674
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,539
Three per stream, right?

675
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:40,250
It doesn't matter.

676
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,610
All right, so let's get back to where we were.

677
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,929
It was, uh, I searched the weeds.

678
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:46,500
There's a pair of eyes staring back.

679
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,539
But what kind of eyes?

680
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:48,500
Do I know?

681
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,059
A pair of eyes is staring back.

682
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:52,179
This could be a person.

683
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:53,699
This could be a different animal.

684
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:56,539
I'm gonna listen.

685
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,230
You've listened intently.

686
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,309
Something is crawling on its belly

687
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:02,460
towards trying to stay hidden.

688
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,500
Whatever is lurking there,

689
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:12,820
it is crawling closer.

690
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,730
Yeah, probably a snake.

691
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:23,590
Curious.

692
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,179
Mud.

693
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:30,409
I could throw a fireball in there.

694
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,409
I could just whip a fireball in there.

695
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:36,469
But I don't know what it is.

696
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:41,420
Uh, walk is shield.

697
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,019
Wall, I believe it's wall,

698
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,699
is create an invisible wall.

699
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:45,980
Too much stamina.

700
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:57,429
Float in the air.

701
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:58,389
Shield is probably good.

702
00:39:58,389 --> 00:40:02,539
Yeah, walk is only one.

703
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:04,219
But it does require something, doesn't it?

704
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:06,940
Requires one stamina and one gold piece.

705
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:09,989
Yeah, let's do it.

706
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:13,420
You place a gold piece on your-

707
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,460
I have 28 gold.

708
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:14,940
Money, money.

709
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,239
You place a gold piece on your wrist and cast a spell.

710
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,000
And a moment later, the coin is gone.

711
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,280
You feel the weight of an invisible shield on your arm.

712
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
At least you will be somewhat defended.

713
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:31,449
The shape moves nearer still.

714
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:33,050
You go over to the bushes

715
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,400
and spread them apart with one arm.

716
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,880
Lying, a shadow inside shadow

717
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,420
is a human figure on its front.

718
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,340
It looks up at you with eyes just visible

719
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,429
through a cloth mask.

720
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:50,940
Now there is a face I have not forgotten.

721
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:00,539
I almost-

722
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:01,659
That's not-

723
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:05,989
It's Flanker!

724
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:08,150
You stare in surprise, it's Flanker.

725
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,019
The assas-

726
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:10,380
Okay, we almost killed Flanker.

727
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,739
I almost threw a fireball at him.

728
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:14,789
The assassin jumps ably to his feet

729
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:16,469
and then brushes himself down.

730
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:19,699
Well met.

731
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:20,900
Okay, we need some context.

732
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,460
All right.

733
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,469
Flanker is an assassin

734
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:26,230
who tried to kill us in the first game.

735
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,070
Spoilers, go watch or go play.

736
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,889
It's a-

737
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:29,530
Go play it.

738
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,809
Don't even watch it.

739
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:32,250
Go-

740
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,050
Go buy this whole series

741
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,809
and just get a cup of fucking cocoa,

742
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:41,900
dim the lights a little, and play it.

743
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,789
It's a-

744
00:41:42,789 --> 00:41:46,619
It's such a wonderful experience.

745
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,469
It is so worth it.

746
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:49,030
This is-

747
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,500
People that ask what's your favorite game of all time,

748
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,619
this is like top five.

749
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,860
Sorcery, the whole series, is like top five.

750
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,460
This one and the fourth game

751
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,539
get kind of really hard and annoying in some places,

752
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:00,219
but still I wouldn't take it off that list.

753
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:05,210
Sorcery, without a doubt,

754
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,409
this is probably top five.

755
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:06,909
Ever.

756
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,059
Unreal bad taste.

757
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:20,010
Steve Jackson is like the inspiration

758
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,929
for a shitload of things

759
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:23,690
that you probably play right now.

760
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,579
I'm just telling you,

761
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:28,809
Steve Jackson's fantasy book series,

762
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:32,489
their road that has been paved,

763
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:33,849
he paved the road.

764
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:38,489
This shit was made in like the 70s.

765
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,050
Ban that guy?

766
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:39,769
No.

767
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:40,329
No.

768
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:41,690
We're not going to ban anybody.

769
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,420
I don't want to ban that person.

770
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,969
I want that person to say,

771
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:47,769
hey, wait a minute.

772
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,800
Let me give this a chance.

773
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,440
They're already gone.

774
00:42:54,139 --> 00:43:00,179
I'm telling you, it's a wonderful franchise.

775
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:01,699
No, well, no, I'm not banning for that.

776
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:03,909
That's an opinion.

777
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:05,110
You think that I have bad taste.

778
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:05,829
That's your opinion.

779
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:08,150
And that you can have that.

780
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:12,650
And I'm going to do some unbearable voice acting.

781
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,019
So it's actually probably a good thing that you left.

782
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:16,340
All right.

783
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,300
What are you doing here?

784
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,760
Oh, I'm making my way to High Zamen,

785
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,800
where I'm needed.

786
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,010
You can see the wilds of the backlands

787
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,369
have been harsh on the assassin.

788
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:30,409
His eyes burn with a hollow fire.

789
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:37,050
How did you get here to this bridge?

790
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,510
I leapt across the Battleback Gorge.

791
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,349
I climbed the Battleback Ridge

792
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:46,809
and use my climbing hooks to descend into the trees.

793
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:50,170
I've killed seven Snattercats before I found this bridge

794
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,019
in which to shelter.

795
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:54,019
How have you made the journey?

796
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:56,440
I forget how Jorah Mormont talks.

797
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,480
It's supposed to be Jorah Mormont

798
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,440
and it was way better like seven years ago.

799
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,829
I haven't seen any Game of Thrones in a long time.

800
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:08,889
How have you made the journey?

801
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,199
I'll tell them about the beacons.

802
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:14,980
By means of the beacons.

803
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,780
The beacons?

804
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:19,369
You've used all the magic of the Archmage?

805
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:22,260
Then no doubt he's sending birdmen

806
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,699
as we speak to have your head.

807
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:25,980
As he speaks, he draws his sword

808
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,260
and runs two gloved fingertips along its length,

809
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,780
honing the edge.

810
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:37,750
I had no choice.

811
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:41,210
There is always a further choice.

812
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,730
You are reckless, Annalander, and foolish.

813
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:50,010
Will you travel with me?

814
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,860
I will not.

815
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,300
You are the target of the Archmage.

816
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,599
You're of the most powerful enemy in the land, Annalander.

817
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:00,570
I do not mean to kill you.

818
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,130
I would have done that in episode one.

819
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:04,730
I do not mean you ill,

820
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:09,980
but time spent with you is dangerous.

821
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,840
Help me before you go.

822
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,599
Remember, you are in my debt.

823
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,219
In truth, I know something that may be of use.

824
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:22,119
A black elf whom I killed for her supplies

825
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,880
told me that the goddess Throff

826
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,900
is the mortal enemy of the Earth Serpent

827
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,619
and can help you defeat him.

828
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:31,619
It may be true, it may not be.

829
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:33,000
I cannot be sure.

830
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,909
With a final salute,

831
00:45:35,909 --> 00:45:37,750
two fingers drawn across the neck

832
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,590
in the manner of his guild.

833
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,829
Flanker straps his sword to his back

834
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:44,389
and swings himself onto a pillar.

835
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:46,389
With enviable speed,

836
00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:48,869
he scrambles up to the top of the bridge.

837
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:51,480
The last you see of him is a figure in black

838
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,789
leaping away to the east.

839
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:58,230
Well, good to see you, Flanker.

840
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,880
Yeah, Flanker is,

841
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:08,949
this game allows you to have a handful of characters

842
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:10,949
you can party up with,

843
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:12,949
if you want to call it that.

844
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:13,909
They all have their own stories,

845
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:15,030
they all have their own stuff.

846
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,389
They all can die.

847
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:18,940
They all can die very early.

848
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,510
It's a wonderful franchise, just try it.

849
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,889
That's all I'm asking you to do.

850
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:23,449
Try it.

851
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,380
Some of you guys tell me

852
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,820
that you sit down in the living room

853
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,900
with your whole family and watch this stream.

854
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:31,179
Are you doing,

855
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:32,940
whoever's doing that right now,

856
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,500
turn me off now.

857
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,179
Go get sorcery.

858
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:36,900
And the whole,

859
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,550
the whole family can do this.

860
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:41,750
Sit down with your whole family.

861
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:43,510
You do that right now anyways.

862
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,869
Sit the whole family down.

863
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:48,219
Make some muffins.

864
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:49,659
All right, let's, let's climb.

865
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:57,000
How much is sorcery on Steam?

866
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,019
I think each episode is like $5.

867
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:06,969
Maybe.

868
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:10,250
It's like $4 for one of these.

869
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:17,239
15 bucks, like 15 for all of them.

870
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:24,760
This is like 100 hours worth of content, by the way.

871
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,880
13 for one and two,

872
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,000
10 for three,

873
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,039
and 10 for four.

874
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:33,420
27 for all of them is worth it.

875
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,780
All right, let's, let's, let's,

876
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,380
let's look down at the forest.

877
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,079
Let's, let's really take it in.

878
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:40,039
Looking down at the forest,

879
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:42,280
you can make out a tower through the treetops

880
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,139
to the southeast.

881
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:45,820
Brass shines from its top.

882
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,780
Looking southwest,

883
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,420
you see a flash of fire through the trees,

884
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,650
squirming and moving in a curious way.

885
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,170
And to the northeast,

886
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,929
you see curling smoke rising

887
00:47:55,929 --> 00:47:57,449
as though from a chimney stack,

888
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:59,400
though you cannot see a house.

889
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,900
The giant stone pillars cast long shadows.

890
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,460
Interesting.

891
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,099
Let's go.

892
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,340
You look out at the side of the bridge

893
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,019
for handholds to the top,

894
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:13,110
but can find nothing that looks safe enough.

895
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:14,550
It seems this is as high

896
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:18,539
as you will be able to climb.

897
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:22,469
Oh, maybe I should have casted a spell.

898
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:30,840
Float.

899
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,440
Turning your eyes to the eastern mountains,

900
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,760
you spy the end of the bridge,

901
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,519
jutting a short way over the valley.

902
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:37,530
And beyond it,

903
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,670
you catch the flash of water.

904
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,230
Lake Eclala.

905
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,789
Somehow, then, you must climb those summits

906
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:47,820
if you mean to continue your journey.

907
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,059
Birds wheel and turn between the stones above.

908
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:52,360
You swing yourself back off the bridge,

909
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,639
onto the pillar.

910
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,840
Your arms are somewhat rested,

911
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,760
but quickly start to burn once more.

912
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:04,619
You'll have to return quickly to the ground.

913
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:11,449
I'm not jumping, right?

914
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,650
Slowly, painstakingly,

915
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,530
you make your way back down

916
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:14,489
and retrieve your weapon.

917
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:15,769
There are several directions

918
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:20,840
in which you could continue.

919
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,840
All right.

920
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,280
Go through the forest of Snatta.

921
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,659
We know what is possible there.

922
00:49:28,659 --> 00:49:32,420
Or head over towards this little pond?

923
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,519
Lake.

924
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:37,079
This also is one of those time travel beams.

925
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,389
It's going to be able to be aimed

926
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:42,389
like this pretty much in any direction.

927
00:49:42,389 --> 00:49:44,460
I think if it were me,

928
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,420
I would want to head over here

929
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,139
and activate this

930
00:49:46,139 --> 00:49:47,420
because we can probably go back in time

931
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,300
and fix the bridge.

932
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:55,239
I think that's where I'm going.

933
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:56,699
Streamer's choice.

934
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:04,699
You head away from the bridge

935
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:07,610
and into the forest.

936
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,329
Very cool.

937
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:13,380
The path winds torturously through the forest.

938
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,460
Your shield shimmers out of existence.

939
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,659
Oh, I still had the shield.

940
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:18,920
Oh, all right.

941
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,010
Okay.

942
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,489
The sun has reached its highest point now.

943
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:25,659
The hot sun is shaded by the trees all around.

944
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,940
The smell of rotting leaf mulch fills your nostrils.

945
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:37,929
I think I want to turn this on.

946
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:41,210
Oh, we can see the movements.

947
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,889
We know where you are.

948
00:50:42,889 --> 00:50:45,099
As Flanka told us,

949
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:47,800
we know where you are.

950
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,340
Yeah, I'm going easy.

951
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:57,719
You walk on between the trees.

952
00:50:57,719 --> 00:50:59,559
The afternoon is starting to draw on.

953
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:01,989
The forest path curves past the shore

954
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:04,380
of a deep, flat pool.

955
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,570
Forage for food.

956
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,610
Look across the water.

957
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:08,889
Cast a spell.

958
00:51:08,889 --> 00:51:09,690
Make a move.

959
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,219
Forage for food.

960
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:13,380
You take a moment to forage

961
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,860
through the nearby bushes for edible-looking plants.

962
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,610
You find a couple of mushrooms and a handful of nuts.

963
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,449
Take the nuts or try a mushroom.

964
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:22,809
This is going to be drugs.

965
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:35,929
And I'm going to like fucking pass out into the water.

966
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:38,489
You tear off one corner of the mushroom

967
00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:39,769
and put it into your tongue.

968
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:41,690
It tastes well enough.

969
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:47,320
You stuff the rest of the mushroom into your mouth.

970
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,039
A moment later,

971
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:49,800
you find the corners of your vision

972
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,880
are popping and discoloring.

973
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,079
It must be tiredness.

974
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:57,750
Drink some water out of the pond.

975
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,750
You go to drink some water and collapse.

976
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:05,610
I just said it was going to happen.

977
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:08,170
Why did I do that?

978
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,610
You go to drink some water and collapse face down in the pool.

979
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,610
You feel unable to push yourself upright.

980
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,090
Strange things happen as you begin to drown.

981
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,300
Loud noises.

982
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:21,500
Explosions are going off close by your ears,

983
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,579
making you jump from side to side.

984
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:26,139
The explosions match the rhythm of your heartbeat almost,

985
00:52:26,139 --> 00:52:27,820
but not quite precisely.

986
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,849
But that's not all.

987
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:32,250
A fat worm made of firecrackers.

988
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:35,130
Seems to be crawling out of one of your eyes

989
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,929
and crossing the bridge of your nose into your other eye.

990
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:41,659
It leaves a slime trail of pink fire in its wake.

991
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,829
You remember your mother,

992
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:46,250
but she appears to have been a goldfish.

993
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:51,480
Strange, shadowy creatures, bats perhaps,

994
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,659
have removed the top of your head.

995
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:55,739
One by one, they take out your memories,

996
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,940
polish them, and organize them into a better pattern within your skull.

997
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,079
Oh, thanks.

998
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:03,289
The dreams, paletsons.

999
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:06,340
You are overcome by a vision of your future.

1000
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,059
You stand in a clearing,

1001
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:10,260
halfway up a mountainside.

1002
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,760
In the middle of the clearing is a tombstone.

1003
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,960
You stand beside it with a vial of water in your hand.

1004
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,110
What is happening?

1005
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,150
Look at the vial.

1006
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,030
Pour the water.

1007
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:29,260
Stand back.

1008
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,500
Look at the vial.

1009
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,980
You look down at the vial to see that it shimmers

1010
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,139
with a strange internal glow.

1011
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:40,789
Pour it out.

1012
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:43,369
You pour the water onto the earth,

1013
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:45,590
and it seeps down through the soil.

1014
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,750
There is magic in the air.

1015
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:52,420
Suddenly, something punches the earth below where you stand.

1016
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,010
Wait.

1017
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,320
You wait.

1018
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,440
And a moment later,

1019
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,599
a skeletal hand erupts through the soil

1020
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:00,440
and grabs you around the ankle.

1021
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,699
Something is hauling itself up from the ground,

1022
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,179
using your leg for purchase.

1023
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,340
The vision fades.

1024
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,139
The sun is sinking.

1025
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:09,590
It will be dark soon.

1026
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:13,429
My head hurts.

1027
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:15,349
You stagger up to your feet,

1028
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:18,070
head beating and stomach feeling wretched.

1029
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:22,010
To find you have thrown up while you are unconscious.

1030
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:25,289
Lucky that no animal has been attracted by the smell.

1031
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:27,449
You quickly bathe your face and hands in the pool

1032
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:30,969
and get ready to move on,

1033
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:37,369
growing for content.

1034
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:40,219
I think I'll take a bite of this weird mushroom.

1035
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:41,659
My eyes just roll on the back of my head

1036
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:43,909
and I fall face first into a pond.

1037
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:45,460
I'm thirsty.

1038
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,659
That was really stupid.

1039
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:51,179
The water extends away to the southeast

1040
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:53,820
towards the dark shadows of the next range of mountains.

1041
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,820
It's not quite a lake,

1042
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,260
but large for a pool,

1043
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,320
and who knows how deep it is.

1044
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,309
On the far side, you see another stone tower.

1045
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:04,730
The ape here.

1046
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,420
The ape is back.

1047
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:11,460
Good old, good old ape.

1048
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,469
Test the water.

1049
00:55:14,469 --> 00:55:22,260
What do I have access to?

1050
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,219
I'm going to go in that water

1051
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,059
and I'm going to drop a bunch of fucking items.

1052
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,019
I'm going to lose everything.

1053
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:31,460
This how, find safe passage.

1054
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:37,210
Maybe it'll give me a good place to go.

1055
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,090
Zen is hover.

1056
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,289
I don't have the item.

1057
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,650
Zip is teleport.

1058
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:43,610
I don't have the ring.

1059
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,530
By the way, these are all,

1060
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:48,860
all the games are connected.

1061
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:49,820
So if you're wondering,

1062
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,179
what do you mean you need to have that item?

1063
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,099
At some point over the first two parts of the campaign,

1064
00:55:55,659 --> 00:55:57,739
you can get this, you know, so lose it too.

1065
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,739
I don't do how.

1066
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,949
How is cheap, right?

1067
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,389
Yeah.

1068
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:12,570
Looking to the constellations above you craft the spell

1069
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,730
and a quiet voice speaks into your thoughts.

1070
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:16,730
The voice tells you calmly

1071
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:19,530
that the water is too deep to walk through

1072
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,530
but could be safely swum.

1073
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,789
Okay, test the water.

1074
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:31,210
The water must be freezing cold,

1075
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,530
but if you had to swim, you could probably survive it.

1076
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,309
I don't want to lose anything though.

1077
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:45,369
If I go across this, it's possible I lose items.

1078
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:54,179
You stride down to the edge of the water,

1079
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:56,260
take a deep breath and dive in.

1080
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,679
Of course, all your water

1081
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:00,760
damageable possessions have been ruined.

1082
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:04,570
Thankfully, the pages of your spell book are protected.

1083
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,539
What does that mean?

1084
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:08,539
What did I have?

1085
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:15,639
Did I have anything important that got ruined?

1086
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,940
I don't know.

1087
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:31,480
I think I have everything still.

1088
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,400
It was, dude, the iPhone.

1089
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:47,300
I think I'm okay.

1090
00:57:48,019 --> 00:57:49,300
I don't think I lost anything important.

1091
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:00,500
You swim across the water

1092
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,420
and pull yourself up on the other shore.

1093
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,860
The sun has all but gone.

1094
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,219
Soon it will be dark.

1095
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,460
Nestled in a curve of the eastern cliffs is a stone tower.

1096
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,820
It is heavily overgrown with thorny branches

1097
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,739
and its base is almost obscured by shrubs and tangled weeds.

1098
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:22,789
Okay, let's take a look.

1099
00:58:23,429 --> 00:58:24,230
Looking up at the tower,

1100
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,909
it looks similar to the others you've seen,

1101
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:28,150
built from the same giant size blocks of stone.

1102
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,349
The only differences are the tree branches

1103
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:34,550
that spill out through cracks in the mortar

1104
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,230
and the leaf canopy that erupts from the top.

1105
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:39,050
Remember that your cigarettes are ruined.

1106
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:39,550
That's all right.

1107
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,750
Oh, I don't have the ape.

1108
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,030
I don't have very much health,

1109
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,230
so I'm just going to try to go through.

1110
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,760
You heft your hewing axe

1111
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,360
and cleave quickly through the branches

1112
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,280
that surround the base of the tower.

1113
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,719
The axe's keen edge makes short work of the thorns

1114
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:57,599
and you have soon cut a path to the tower's door.

1115
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,239
Cool.

1116
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:02,000
Something seems to rustle and move

1117
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,679
just inside the tower door.

1118
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:13,789
He's finally playing Tears of the Kingdom.

1119
00:59:14,349 --> 00:59:17,230
You step up to the tower door

1120
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:20,030
and step inside into the shadows

1121
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:25,679
to be met by a soft, damp smell of the tower.

1122
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,079
You step into the dark interior of the tower.

1123
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,860
Shadows loom from all sides

1124
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,219
and though you can see nothing,

1125
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,739
there is the sense that something dominates the space.

1126
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:47,480
Feel my way forward or wait for my eyes to adjust.

1127
00:59:48,809 --> 00:59:51,579
Wait.

1128
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:52,219
You hold back,

1129
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,059
waiting for your eyes to adjust.

1130
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:57,070
Slowly, details filter in.

1131
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,389
You're standing at the base of a gigantic tree.

1132
00:59:59,949 --> 01:00:02,349
By the girth, it must be at least 500 years old.

1133
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,809
A wooden staircase winds around the trunk

1134
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,090
and disappears into the canopy.

1135
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,860
The tree is wider than your outstretched arms

1136
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,500
and has thick branches and leaves despite the dark.

1137
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,960
Somewhere up above, used by a metallic glint.

1138
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,159
Time to explore.

1139
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:19,550
Okay, we're good.

1140
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,150
You climb the spiraling wooden stairs

1141
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:26,750
picking your way through and over branches.

1142
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:29,389
Someone has carved something

1143
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:31,150
into the bark of the tree here.

1144
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:32,960
What's it say?

1145
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:35,230
Whoa!

1146
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:40,079
You regard the carving with some interest.

1147
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,760
It is triangle formed from three stars.

1148
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,400
A spell.

1149
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,639
Using your spell book as a reference,

1150
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:48,000
you match the stars in the carving

1151
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,199
to those you know until you have the spell memorized.

1152
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:53,760
This is the SSS spell.

1153
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,420
Though from what you can make out of its alignment,

1154
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,260
it would need a focus to work.

1155
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,539
A ring, most likely.

1156
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:03,179
With a curious coiled fashion, snake-like.

1157
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:06,719
The SSS spell has been recorded in your spell book.

1158
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,079
Really?

1159
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:17,789
Requires a serpent ring.

1160
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:21,230
The spell enables the caster to force information from serpents.

1161
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,260
Shit.

1162
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:37,869
Six most useful spell.

1163
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,650
Okay, so I need to get the ring.

1164
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:42,010
Wherever that is.

1165
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:52,030
His shrimps is bugs.

1166
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,429
No, it's like a crustacean or some shit.

1167
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,639
You emerge onto a stone walkway

1168
01:01:57,639 --> 01:01:59,559
built in a ring that allows the tree to grow through.

1169
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:02,730
Resting in its branches is a brass contraption

1170
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,960
much like the ones you've already seen.

1171
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,719
Gears and bearing carefully

1172
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:08,480
get meshed between the limbs of the tree.

1173
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:11,340
As leaves gust back and forth,

1174
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,059
something else brass glints from within.

1175
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:18,679
What is it?

1176
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:22,519
You reach out to bend in the branch

1177
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:24,440
from which the gleam is coming.

1178
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,639
It is a ring, slipped over the tip of the branch.

1179
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:29,559
The wood has grown into the metal somewhat,

1180
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:30,920
suggesting the ring was placed here

1181
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,599
when the tree was somewhat younger.

1182
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:34,280
Is it a snake ring?

1183
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,280
You stand on tiptoes to peer at the ring.

1184
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,039
It is some kind of marking,

1185
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,400
but you cannot quite make it out.

1186
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:46,190
Take it.

1187
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,199
You try to work the ring back up the branch,

1188
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:53,039
but it is too firmly ingrown.

1189
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,559
You cannot get it to move at all.

1190
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,579
Break the branch.

1191
01:02:57,219 --> 01:03:00,139
The wood is still alive,

1192
01:03:00,139 --> 01:03:01,820
so breaking it is hard work.

1193
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,019
But in the end, the branch gives,

1194
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:04,380
snapping violently in two.

1195
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:06,699
The ring pings off the end

1196
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,179
and disappears into the nearby trees.

1197
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:09,820
Shit.

1198
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,909
Climb down.

1199
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:19,809
You make your way quickly into the wooden walkway.

1200
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:20,690
Look for the dropped ring.

1201
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:24,159
The undergrowth here is quite thick,

1202
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,780
and despite thrashing at the bushes,

1203
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,300
you cannot see any hint of the ring

1204
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,260
that fell from the tower.

1205
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,179
It may not even have fallen

1206
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:32,940
this close to the tower's base.

1207
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:36,289
So it's most likely at the bottom of the pool by now.

1208
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,880
No, it's not.

1209
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,380
I'll use magic.

1210
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:48,929
See the future.

1211
01:03:50,449 --> 01:03:51,409
I didn't know where the-

1212
01:03:51,409 --> 01:03:54,210
I didn't know what fucking bet to put

1213
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:55,170
on what football team.

1214
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:56,369
All right.

1215
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:57,329
See the future?

1216
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,360
I still-

1217
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,199
I do have a crystal orb.

1218
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:08,829
Xanis hover.

1219
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,139
I could probably float.

1220
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:12,800
Force field.

1221
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:19,059
I guess I can only do force-

1222
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:26,269
I can only-

1223
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:27,869
I can see the future.

1224
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,309
Let's go for it.

1225
01:04:31,179 --> 01:04:32,909
I'm gonna see the future.

1226
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:34,750
You settle into a sitting position

1227
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:39,579
by the roots of a tree

1228
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:41,099
and take out the orb of crystal.

1229
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:42,940
You weave the starlight

1230
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,219
into your design around you

1231
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:45,019
and suddenly you find yourself

1232
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:46,059
somewhere quite new.

1233
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:49,280
The world seems to disappear,

1234
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,960
replaced by a vision,

1235
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,679
a ring of tall, shadowy stones,

1236
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:55,280
and a desolate waste.

1237
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,130
You stand at the edge of the world

1238
01:04:58,449 --> 01:04:59,170
at their center,

1239
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,530
holding above your head

1240
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,289
a long yellow feather

1241
01:05:02,289 --> 01:05:04,289
taken from some colossal bird.

1242
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:06,690
You are casting a spell

1243
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,530
of curious power.

1244
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:13,260
See what happens.

1245
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:17,300
The spell begins to take hold

1246
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,659
and the feather erupts into flame

1247
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,380
as though you held a fiery sword.

1248
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,739
The fire reaches down your arm

1249
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:24,860
and into your bones

1250
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:25,739
and you feel yourself

1251
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:27,820
swelling with great strength.

1252
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,199
The vision fades.

1253
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,389
Darkness closes in

1254
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:32,349
and you are exhausted.

1255
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:33,469
You need to rest,

1256
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:34,349
especially after going all day

1257
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:34,909
without eating.

1258
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:37,059
Shit.

1259
01:05:39,789 --> 01:05:39,949
Shit.

1260
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:51,699
Damn it.

1261
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,539
Can I not get the ring?

1262
01:05:55,179 --> 01:06:01,920
I need to eat something.

1263
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,719
I don't have any food.

1264
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,059
Rewind?

1265
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:17,570
How far back do I need to go?

1266
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:25,389
Okay, look at the brass glint.

1267
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:27,460
Look at the ring.

1268
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,079
Take the ring.

1269
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:35,809
Break the branch.

1270
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:37,090
Leave it?

1271
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:40,590
Shit.

1272
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:48,989
Let's activate the shit.

1273
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:55,659
I think I have to break it.

1274
01:06:55,659 --> 01:06:57,570
Maybe time rewind.

1275
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:59,570
Time first tree won't be grown.

1276
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:03,920
Wait, so leave it.

1277
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,360
Oh, you're very smart.

1278
01:07:09,789 --> 01:07:11,809
Leave it there.

1279
01:07:11,809 --> 01:07:13,409
We're going to go back into the past.

1280
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,090
Is that going to work?

1281
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:16,610
That's actually pretty smart.

1282
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:17,650
All right, let's just do it.

1283
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:18,769
Let's activate it.

1284
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:22,190
Scan the forest.

1285
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:25,679
Look at the mountains.

1286
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:27,920
Yeah, okay.

1287
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,719
Activate the beacon.

1288
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,820
Here we go.

1289
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:39,150
I can aim it.

1290
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:45,489
I could go right here.

1291
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:49,630
I wonder if that helps.

1292
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:52,539
Oh, no, this is going to work

1293
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:54,139
because I will pull it off.

1294
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,380
We're in the present right now.

1295
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,019
It'll pop off and land over on the ground over there.

1296
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:03,170
You adjust the contraption's position and focus carefully,

1297
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,929
watching the land shift and change under its light

1298
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:05,889
as you make your adjustment.

1299
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:10,079
Finally, satisfied, you set the lantern

1300
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,010
into one of the things and step back.

1301
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:19,090
Okay, so now I have to...

1302
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,409
Can I pull it off now?

1303
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:28,579
Do I have to pull it off first?

1304
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:33,470
I may have done it in the wrong order.

1305
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,859
Pronounce the word.

1306
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:42,739
Crenelations.

1307
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:45,039
Crenelations.

1308
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,539
Let's climb down and see.

1309
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:53,779
Outside the tower.

1310
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,979
Okay, make a move.

1311
01:08:58,619 --> 01:09:02,319
I don't think so.

1312
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:03,600
I think I have to do it in the other order.

1313
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,159
I think I have to pull it off first and then I go back.

1314
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,130
Shine beam, then do the ring.

1315
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:13,920
All right, what if I go back up the tower?

1316
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,359
Will it give me the option to do it?

1317
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,739
Okay, climb up.

1318
01:09:23,489 --> 01:09:25,409
Shit, I lost the opportunity to do it.

1319
01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:27,729
Let me see what happens if I pull it off and then do this.

1320
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:28,850
Yeah, because I want to know

1321
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,689
because I've never gotten this ring before.

1322
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,529
Maybe I did in my other playthrough.

1323
01:09:32,529 --> 01:09:33,329
I don't know.

1324
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:41,100
Okay, eyes adjust.

1325
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:43,140
Make a move.

1326
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:47,649
Very loose with the rewinds this run.

1327
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:49,090
Yeah, I know.

1328
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:51,310
Look at the carving.

1329
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:54,189
Yep, now we know the snake spell.

1330
01:09:55,579 --> 01:09:56,060
Go up.

1331
01:09:58,289 --> 01:10:00,989
Okay, look at the brass glint.

1332
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:02,930
Take the ring.

1333
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:06,960
Look at the ring.

1334
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:09,409
Break the branch.

1335
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:15,199
All right, branch is broken.

1336
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,000
Activate the beam.

1337
01:10:17,859 --> 01:10:19,140
Adjust the beam.

1338
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,859
Get rid of the water.

1339
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:24,619
So now the theory is that this will be probably right outside,

1340
01:10:24,619 --> 01:10:25,579
just sitting here.

1341
01:10:25,579 --> 01:10:27,420
Let's take a look.

1342
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:31,550
Okay, climb down.

1343
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:36,159
Does that do it?

1344
01:10:38,619 --> 01:10:39,899
Look for the dropped ring.

1345
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:45,170
Shit!

1346
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:51,840
It's, yeah, I can't activate it here.

1347
01:10:52,399 --> 01:11:03,020
Let's go see if it's out here.

1348
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:11,279
All right, cross the pool.

1349
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,140
You splash through the water,

1350
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,300
but after a while it seems to dry up,

1351
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,270
leaving only dry rock.

1352
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:23,119
You make your way easily to the other side.

1353
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:25,819
In all directions, the forest has been replaced by marsh.

1354
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:27,579
Except for here.

1355
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:30,899
A small, bald plain of rock.

1356
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:31,939
A little way to the southeast,

1357
01:11:31,939 --> 01:11:34,579
a little, at least a stone tower still rises,

1358
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:36,819
though it is dwarfed by the violent mountains behind.

1359
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:39,600
Shit!

1360
01:11:43,869 --> 01:11:45,390
All right, I know, I know, I know, I know.

1361
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,829
Rewind, rewind, Andy, I know.

1362
01:11:46,829 --> 01:11:48,109
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1363
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:49,470
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

1364
01:11:52,289 --> 01:11:54,130
How do I get this?

1365
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:55,170
Do I need that item?

1366
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:58,220
All right, get it in your playthrough.

1367
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:58,779
I don't need it.

1368
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:05,949
Beacon first.

1369
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:09,170
Okay, beacon first.

1370
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:12,689
Which should be, like, where should I aim it?

1371
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,210
Just to cover the water?

1372
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:19,229
I think that makes sense.

1373
01:12:19,229 --> 01:12:33,069
Touch the crystal.

1374
01:12:33,869 --> 01:12:35,789
Touching the, so when we touch the crystal,

1375
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:38,930
we can teleport to another beacon.

1376
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:47,899
So let's actually, hold on, can I aim?

1377
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:49,819
No, I don't have any other one unlocked.

1378
01:12:49,819 --> 01:12:51,840
Because sometimes if you have another one,

1379
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,380
you can aim it at the tower.

1380
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,260
Point another beacon at it?

1381
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,239
Yeah, I don't have any.

1382
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,319
I have to, there's probably one here,

1383
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:01,680
like down here that I can aim up this way.

1384
01:13:11,229 --> 01:13:16,880
Okay, it's all right, it's all right.

1385
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,180
This is not as funny as the Jerma compilations on YouTube.

1386
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:29,710
I mean, I'm just streaming, man.

1387
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:35,329
A whole stream can't be a funny moments compilation.

1388
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:40,659
That compilation is probably like eight minutes.

1389
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,140
I've been live for five hours.

1390
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:46,609
There's probably like two times during this whole stream

1391
01:13:46,609 --> 01:13:48,210
where one of those clips would come from.

1392
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,920
Maybe one of those happens a stream, maybe.

1393
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:02,880
Sometimes, I'm not so sure.

1394
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,869
Sometimes I'm not so sure.

1395
01:14:05,869 --> 01:14:15,619
Turn the wacky dial up?

1396
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:18,979
No, no, we don't turn the wacky dial up during sorcery.

1397
01:14:18,979 --> 01:14:24,850
Well, let's make a funny moment for the clip compilations, right?

1398
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,239
That was actually kind of funny.

1399
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:40,319
That was kind of funny.

1400
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:51,250
Okay, I want to fix the bridge

1401
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:54,289
because I want to go over there.

1402
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:57,949
I want to go back here and walk across it.

1403
01:14:57,949 --> 01:14:59,550
I need two of these though.

1404
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:06,369
Can I get the whole thing in one go?

1405
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:12,770
I don't think so.

1406
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:19,340
I'll get the first part.

1407
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,420
Now let's teleport here.

1408
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,420
And I'm going to come over this way

1409
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,779
because I want to see there's probably something here.

1410
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:40,930
Adjust the beam.

1411
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:50,510
I'm going to aim this one this way.

1412
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:59,229
All right, so we are here.

1413
01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:00,829
You adjust the beam around its track,

1414
01:16:00,829 --> 01:16:02,350
sweeping the glow across the land,

1415
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,670
tie rope ladder to battle mint.

1416
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,149
What?

1417
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:11,569
You turn about on the spot, talking in the view.

1418
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:14,590
Oh, taking in the view in all directions.

1419
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:19,250
The fissure in the land is now to the south and rushes with water.

1420
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,170
And where the light from the cylinder falls,

1421
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:22,850
all is bright and green.

1422
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:25,250
The effect makes your eyes water.

1423
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:28,270
Should I tie a rope?

1424
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:29,630
I have a rope?

1425
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:38,479
Maybe I should just do it.

1426
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:40,350
Let's try it.

1427
01:16:41,539 --> 01:16:43,220
You fasten the end of the rope ladder

1428
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:44,420
to the battle mint of the tower

1429
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:46,100
and then toss the rungs over the side.

1430
01:16:48,699 --> 01:16:49,340
All right, let's go.

1431
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,060
What did that do?

1432
01:16:57,149 --> 01:17:01,439
I don't know.

1433
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:03,439
The inside of the tower is cavernous and empty,

1434
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:04,960
but for a stone staircase.

1435
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,920
Why did I do that?

1436
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,909
I want my rope back.

1437
01:17:08,909 --> 01:17:17,649
Yeah, I want my rope back.

1438
01:17:17,649 --> 01:17:20,340
All right, actually tying the people out saying muted.

1439
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,979
That's a joke from like fucking 2016.

1440
01:17:23,699 --> 01:17:24,500
Come on, guys.

1441
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:26,909
That's not going in the compilation.

1442
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:47,260
All right, so now I want to go back this way over here

1443
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,739
because I want to see what happens here.

1444
01:17:49,739 --> 01:17:50,380
What happens?

1445
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,739
Can I like jump off maybe?

1446
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,020
I have no idea.

1447
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,220
Let's go find out.

1448
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:59,729
All right, follow an old road.

1449
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:00,529
Darkness closes in.

1450
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:03,010
You need to rest, especially if you're going all the way without eating.

1451
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,770
I just need to go to a town or something.

1452
01:18:05,409 --> 01:18:08,909
This is where I was.

1453
01:18:08,909 --> 01:18:10,029
That's where I started.

1454
01:18:10,029 --> 01:18:13,579
The cold night lingers on.

1455
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:16,979
All right, here we go.

1456
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:20,060
The bridge is now here.

1457
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:24,770
You lost a little gold.

1458
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:27,649
Met Flanker once more and found one new clue.

1459
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:33,939
You ever played 80 Days?

1460
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:35,619
Same people who made Sorcery.

1461
01:18:35,619 --> 01:18:36,500
I have, actually.

1462
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,140
Long time ago.

1463
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:38,739
That one's really good, too.

1464
01:18:39,539 --> 01:18:42,340
I like Sorcery more because I feel like it's a little more involved.

1465
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:45,310
But 80 Days is very good, too.

1466
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:47,949
Okay.

1467
01:18:47,949 --> 01:18:50,750
You return up the winding path to the top of the mountain.

1468
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:53,470
In the distance, the sun breaks over the horizon.

1469
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,789
You've been awake all night and are weaker for it.

1470
01:18:55,789 --> 01:18:58,140
At the peak of the mountain is a sudden plateau

1471
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,699
looking down across a fetid swampy valley to the east.

1472
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,260
But you may not need to tramp through them

1473
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:06,939
as a magnificent stone bridge spans outwards from its peak.

1474
01:19:06,939 --> 01:19:09,729
Watch for a second.

1475
01:19:09,729 --> 01:19:14,300
Altered by some sixth sense, you hesitate behind a rocky outcrop.

1476
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,140
Just a figure shambles, just a figure shambles into view,

1477
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,699
emerging from a small hut beside the bridge.

1478
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,609
It's me, the Annalander.

1479
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:26,270
Look at the figure.

1480
01:19:28,539 --> 01:19:30,699
You stare at the hunched figure.

1481
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:34,220
He is aged, leaning heavily on a wizened stick

1482
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:38,460
with one eye much larger than the other and a hunch on his back.

1483
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:43,779
The figure shambles onto the first stone of the bridge.

1484
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:50,909
Sighing at the effort, wait for him to cross.

1485
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:54,130
I think I want to announce myself.

1486
01:19:54,130 --> 01:20:05,390
You get to your feet.

1487
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:07,550
Oh there, greetings!

1488
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:10,460
The figure turns to you, leaning heavily on its stick.

1489
01:20:12,029 --> 01:20:14,510
An ugly sword, what brings you here?

1490
01:20:15,069 --> 01:20:22,420
If the Vancas bridge you wish to cross, prepared be for dismay and fear.

1491
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:24,609
You are Vancas.

1492
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:25,970
You're Vancas.

1493
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:28,590
Vancas is my name, it's true.

1494
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:31,710
I give you that, what good it do.

1495
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:36,260
What lies in the valley below?

1496
01:20:37,579 --> 01:20:39,340
Martian murder, tower death.

1497
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:43,149
Above it all, a drop to catch the breath.

1498
01:20:46,829 --> 01:20:50,619
The bridgekeeper pauses to scratch his swollen right eye.

1499
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:53,970
Approach the bridge.

1500
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:56,579
You approach the bridge.

1501
01:20:56,579 --> 01:20:59,779
This is my bridge, it spans a rift.

1502
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:02,739
To pass you must provide a gift.

1503
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:07,199
The sudden image of the orb of crystal pops into your head.

1504
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:13,579
You want my orb of crystal?

1505
01:21:13,579 --> 01:21:18,619
We can do better than that.

1506
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,100
Your price is too much, rogue.

1507
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,770
Vancas shakes his head without interest.

1508
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:28,140
Then the hunchback looks up sharply.

1509
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:32,000
Unless a simpler price you'd gladly pay.

1510
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,859
An arm, a leg, finger, prey?

1511
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:41,710
Take my leg, take a finger.

1512
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:43,010
No.

1513
01:21:47,329 --> 01:21:47,970
No.

1514
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:51,390
You shake your head, Vancas shrugs.

1515
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,779
Just as you please.

1516
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,159
Patience is some men's disease.

1517
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:59,569
With a thought he gently reminds you of the original price.

1518
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:01,010
The orb.

1519
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:12,109
Walk away.

1520
01:22:12,109 --> 01:22:13,789
Your heart, you find, is pounding.

1521
01:22:13,789 --> 01:22:15,550
You turn and leave to the mountaintop.

1522
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,020
God damn it.

1523
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:45,069
Wait, what?

1524
01:22:45,069 --> 01:22:45,630
Okay, we're good.

1525
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,850
Rewind Ronald?

1526
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:56,689
Yeah, but I know.

1527
01:22:56,689 --> 01:22:58,130
We don't have any rules today.

1528
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:04,699
I, look, there cannot be rewind rules.

1529
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:06,989
When it's the first time I've played.

1530
01:23:06,989 --> 01:23:08,670
In the middle of an episode.

1531
01:23:08,670 --> 01:23:10,529
A year later.

1532
01:23:10,529 --> 01:23:12,510
We'll do that next time.

1533
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:13,470
Okay, announce myself.

1534
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,710
You are Vancas.

1535
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:19,149
It's me, okay.

1536
01:23:19,149 --> 01:23:21,340
What lies in the valley below?

1537
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,619
Martian mud.

1538
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:23,420
Approach the bridge.

1539
01:23:26,029 --> 01:23:26,590
Cast a spell.

1540
01:23:32,109 --> 01:23:36,060
Okay, I could zap.

1541
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,819
I could literally just fucking zap.

1542
01:23:37,819 --> 01:23:38,380
I could zap.

1543
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,699
That's the meme one.

1544
01:23:42,699 --> 01:23:43,899
Pop is throw a grenade.

1545
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,340
I don't have a pebble.

1546
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,859
This is magic protection.

1547
01:23:59,779 --> 01:24:01,539
Dim is cause stupidity.

1548
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,739
Let's try it.

1549
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,619
You weave the starlight into your design around you.

1550
01:24:09,619 --> 01:24:11,380
But Vancas raises one arm.

1551
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:14,500
On which is a huge bone bracelet.

1552
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,079
He utters something under his breath.

1553
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:19,789
And a moment later, your spell has evaporated.

1554
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:22,909
Curses like chickens will round your head be flocked.

1555
01:24:22,909 --> 01:24:26,420
Lest you learn that every spell you cast is by another.

1556
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:27,779
Blocked.

1557
01:24:27,779 --> 01:24:30,590
You recognize the spell he cast.

1558
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:35,220
So then the spell of stupidity is negated by that of illusion.

1559
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,739
You've learned a new counter spell.

1560
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:49,840
Okay, well, I think I'm gonna give him a finger.

1561
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,460
Should I give him a leg?

1562
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:52,960
Zap?

1563
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:54,560
Fine.

1564
01:24:58,289 --> 01:24:59,859
See what happens.

1565
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:03,920
Zap.

1566
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:11,279
Gathering a bolt of lightning in your palm.

1567
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:14,319
But Vancas pulls out some kind of jeweled medallion in return.

1568
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:16,319
And begins to hover up into the air.

1569
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:18,239
A moment later, he is on the ground.

1570
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:19,680
And the lightning in your palm is gone.

1571
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:22,699
If you will not learn the rule,

1572
01:25:22,699 --> 01:25:25,500
you must expect to be taken for a cretin.

1573
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,170
This spell is familiar to you.

1574
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:30,930
It seems the magic of lightning counters the pattern of levitation.

1575
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:38,460
He wants the orb.

1576
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:40,800
I could give him a finger.

1577
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,239
I would rather lose a finger.

1578
01:25:44,529 --> 01:25:45,170
Take a finger.

1579
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:48,939
A finger, you reply boldly.

1580
01:25:48,939 --> 01:25:51,020
Very good, the price is made.

1581
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,260
The littlest one now conveyed.

1582
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,899
And he does not seem to do anything.

1583
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:58,619
But the little finger on your sword hand bends backwards

1584
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:00,380
until it snaps with a click.

1585
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:02,460
And then detaches, falling to the dirt.

1586
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:03,899
You howl in pain.

1587
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:05,789
And that is that.

1588
01:26:05,789 --> 01:26:09,149
With a last clear nod, the hunchback steps from the bridge

1589
01:26:09,149 --> 01:26:10,510
and back into his hut.

1590
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:12,350
Leaving the way clear for you to pass.

1591
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:18,340
Okay.

1592
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:26,479
You step onto the bridge, the air moves a little.

1593
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:28,399
Still icy, but fresh.

1594
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,600
The flagstones laid along the bridge top

1595
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,010
form the straightest, smoothest road you've ever seen.

1596
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:38,770
Finer even than the King's Road of Analand.

1597
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:40,340
Look down.

1598
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:42,260
You cast a look over the side of the walkway

1599
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,420
and your head immediately begins to swim.

1600
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:47,949
The drop is immense, the ground lost far below and missed.

1601
01:26:47,949 --> 01:26:49,710
How was this bridge built?

1602
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:50,989
How could it ever be repaired?

1603
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:54,180
Shit.

1604
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:00,050
Oh.

1605
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:04,319
The rising winds pull at your hair and cloak.

1606
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,840
You reach the middle of the bridge

1607
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,600
and the stones begin to shimmer and ripple.

1608
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:10,960
The smooth white flagstones become cracked and old.

1609
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,199
Palked with holes and puddles.

1610
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,840
Some of which have burrowed right through the path.

1611
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,880
The grand pillars left and right are now broken.

1612
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,239
And up ahead you see something worse.

1613
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,380
A gap.

1614
01:27:26,289 --> 01:27:26,930
The edge.

1615
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:35,409
You pick your way to the broken edge through the thin clouds.

1616
01:27:35,409 --> 01:27:38,050
You can make out the canopy of a forest far below.

1617
01:27:40,109 --> 01:27:40,750
Ooh!

1618
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:44,960
I can use the ladder here.

1619
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:45,460
Look down.

1620
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,920
You look over the edge but there's nothing to be seen.

1621
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,680
Merely fallen rocks and empty air.

1622
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:55,220
I don't want to lose a gold piece for no reason.

1623
01:27:55,779 --> 01:28:00,319
I'm going to use the...

1624
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,239
Because this would be a good way to get back up.

1625
01:28:03,899 --> 01:28:05,899
You consider using the rope ladder to clamber down

1626
01:28:05,899 --> 01:28:07,579
but the drop is far too far.

1627
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:08,079
Oh.

1628
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:09,199
Uh.

1629
01:28:11,729 --> 01:28:14,380
Toss a gold piece over the edge.

1630
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:17,420
It turns and turns in the air and eventually disappears.

1631
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,779
The drop is dizzying.

1632
01:28:18,779 --> 01:28:20,460
Well I just wasted a fucking gold piece.

1633
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:25,619
Damn it!

1634
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,880
Well I can't rewind for that.

1635
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,649
What about over here?

1636
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,739
Oh this is so I can...

1637
01:28:38,739 --> 01:28:39,239
Okay.

1638
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:44,510
This is I can climb down here again.

1639
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:48,050
I need the bridge to be complete.

1640
01:28:48,050 --> 01:29:00,739
Alright I'm going to teleport back over here.

1641
01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:01,939
You lost a finger for this.

1642
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:04,460
Yeah well when I come back...

1643
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:07,100
When I can do this again I won't have to pay two fingers.

1644
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:11,329
Feeling like Herm.

1645
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:12,850
God of cloud cover.

1646
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:15,460
Who walks the heavens as the day rolls by.

1647
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:18,340
It's a great pity whoever built this did not think to build a bridge

1648
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:19,939
all the way across Lake Iklala.

1649
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,479
Alright I'm just going to get back here and we'll teleport.

1650
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:26,880
Back to here.

1651
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:28,399
And then...

1652
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:30,000
I want to go down here.

1653
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,319
There's a town here.

1654
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:34,800
I need to buy food and stuff.

1655
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,199
Yeah.

1656
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:36,000
I'm going to...

1657
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,119
Let's go this way.

1658
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:42,979
Okay.

1659
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,479
Look in the hut.

1660
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:48,800
Overcome by curiosity you approach the hut.

1661
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,520
It takes two circles to find there is no apparent door at all.

1662
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:54,829
Call out for vankas.

1663
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,470
You call out for vankas but there is no reply

1664
01:29:57,470 --> 01:30:01,680
and your voice is carried away by the endless wind.

1665
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:02,399
Knock on the hut.

1666
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:06,180
You tap once then quickly stop.

1667
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:08,819
As you feel your skin sticking to the hut walls.

1668
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:13,149
There are now grazed patches on your knuckles.

1669
01:30:13,149 --> 01:30:18,590
Looking more closely you see the hut itself seems to not be not canvas

1670
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:20,350
but a thick layer of skin.

1671
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:25,550
Okay.

1672
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:27,819
That's a little gross.

1673
01:30:28,539 --> 01:30:31,550
Head back into the forest of Snato.

1674
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,319
I could also go here.

1675
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:41,600
No, we did a lot of this already.

1676
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:46,050
Some of this up here was not explored but we can come back.

1677
01:30:49,659 --> 01:30:51,659
Play this with your family, Jerma said earlier.

1678
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:56,750
You climb down the mountain and join the old road.

1679
01:30:57,390 --> 01:31:00,350
Clouds rumble as they roll across the inky sky.

1680
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:01,869
It will be night soon.

1681
01:31:01,869 --> 01:31:04,989
Suddenly the ground beneath you rumbles and begins to slide into itself.

1682
01:31:04,989 --> 01:31:06,350
There's no time for a spell.

1683
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:08,590
Your arms are wide trying to maintain your balance.

1684
01:31:09,229 --> 01:31:09,729
Jump.

1685
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:15,649
You try to jump clear but gain no decent purchase on the shifting sand.

1686
01:31:15,649 --> 01:31:18,850
Meanwhile the ground is moving away faster and faster from under your feet.

1687
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:22,130
You fall backwards spreading out your legs to reduce your pressure on the sand.

1688
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:25,890
Then you scramble back as fast as possible trying to escape the growing pit.

1689
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,840
God damn it.

1690
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:38,000
So I'm gonna giant.

1691
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,600
Giant could probably carry me.

1692
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:43,880
Zip.

1693
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,319
I don't have the ring to teleport.

1694
01:31:47,539 --> 01:31:48,420
I could float.

1695
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:51,189
Float in air.

1696
01:31:56,180 --> 01:31:57,539
Wall is making invisible wall.

1697
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,859
Or walk is make a shield.

1698
01:32:00,899 --> 01:32:07,880
I'm gonna say we get the giant.

1699
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:18,449
Float is probably the simplest one.

1700
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:20,289
I want to save the giant's teeth.

1701
01:32:20,289 --> 01:32:21,329
Let's float.

1702
01:32:21,329 --> 01:32:25,029
There's no time to waste.

1703
01:32:25,029 --> 01:32:28,789
You cast the spell lightening your body weight to a mere fraction of normal.

1704
01:32:28,789 --> 01:32:32,949
Should you fall you'll be safe but the spell won't last long.

1705
01:32:32,949 --> 01:32:37,829
But though you are now floating above the ground the ground is still moving downwards

1706
01:32:37,829 --> 01:32:39,029
and so are you.

1707
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:44,199
As the ground slips further away forming a pit in the ground you slide helplessly

1708
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:46,439
in to where something is waiting.

1709
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:51,729
So I just slowly fell very very comfortably.

1710
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:09,079
Let's get a giant.

1711
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:16,720
Consulting the stars you bind the magic throwing a giant's tooth into the pit before you.

1712
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:19,520
For a moment there's a strong colon of smoke

1713
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:23,840
and a moment later a giant is floundering in the quicksand in front of you.

1714
01:33:25,779 --> 01:33:26,819
Climb onto the giant.

1715
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:32,079
You scramble up onto the giant's shoulders and then onto its head

1716
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:34,000
until you are clear of the quicksand below.

1717
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:38,850
Whatever is underneath is clearly finding the giant difficult to swallow

1718
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:44,880
because the land slip slows in speed.

1719
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:45,439
Jump clear.

1720
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:47,920
You jump clear of the land slip.

1721
01:33:50,529 --> 01:33:50,850
Watch.

1722
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:56,789
At a safe distance you watch as the sand trap continues to swirl.

1723
01:33:56,789 --> 01:33:59,989
A moment later a creature has erupted from the surface.

1724
01:33:59,989 --> 01:34:01,909
It is a badu beetle.

1725
01:34:01,909 --> 01:34:14,770
Where's the giant?

1726
01:34:21,109 --> 01:34:22,949
Cause lively dancing.

1727
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:24,069
I don't need to see any others.

1728
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:29,300
You pull out your pipe and begin to play.

1729
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:32,659
The beetle freezes at its advance from the pit

1730
01:34:32,659 --> 01:34:37,859
then rears up onto its back legs and begins to wave its front legs in the air

1731
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,819
in a rhythmic cycling motion.

1732
01:34:40,819 --> 01:34:44,770
The sand underneath the beetle begins to slide back down into the pit.

1733
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:48,000
Play slower?

1734
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,090
I wonder.

1735
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:50,369
I'm gonna play slower.

1736
01:34:50,369 --> 01:34:54,920
You begin to play more slowly and the badu beetle responds.

1737
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,760
The speed of its flailing becomes a stately crawl.

1738
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:03,720
As its legs slow down it can no longer hold itself up in the sand pit

1739
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:07,539
and it begins to slide quietly out of sight.

1740
01:35:07,539 --> 01:35:08,739
Time to move on.

1741
01:35:08,739 --> 01:35:11,729
Well that was dangerous.

1742
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:13,619
Okay.

1743
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:21,430
Yeah we kind of sacrificed the giant to the quicksand.

1744
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:22,390
That was kind of terrible.

1745
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:28,369
All right.

1746
01:35:28,369 --> 01:35:30,229
Back up.

1747
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:31,600
I'm gonna teleport.

1748
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:36,180
I will probably move this to somewhere better as well.

1749
01:35:36,819 --> 01:35:41,119
This is actually a good place to sleep.

1750
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:49,090
You settle down expecting a peaceful night.

1751
01:35:49,090 --> 01:35:52,369
You've eaten nothing today but there is nothing you can do to abate your hunger.

1752
01:35:52,369 --> 01:35:54,289
I have raw meat but I can't cook it.

1753
01:35:54,289 --> 01:35:57,000
Let's go to bed.

1754
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,840
You lie back and try to forget your troubles.

1755
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:02,920
You feel untouched by danger here and your slumber is unbroken by dreams.

1756
01:36:06,689 --> 01:36:08,689
You lost significant stamina.

1757
01:36:08,689 --> 01:36:09,890
Lost a bit of gold.

1758
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:13,010
Walked on the ancient backlands bridge and found no new clues.

1759
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:26,050
Adjust the beam to be...

1760
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:34,079
Do I want to change it from the forest of snata to whatever it would be?

1761
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:35,619
I'll leave it as it is.

1762
01:36:35,619 --> 01:36:37,720
Did I do that?

1763
01:36:40,369 --> 01:36:47,520
Have I done this town over here?

1764
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,140
I don't think so.

1765
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:50,020
Didn't remember.

1766
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:54,399
Let's go check it out.

1767
01:36:54,399 --> 01:37:02,100
I don't remember going up that high.

1768
01:37:02,659 --> 01:37:07,970
I feel like there's just so many possibilities to go from this section.

1769
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:08,770
Where do you even begin?

1770
01:37:09,489 --> 01:37:11,750
That's some of the most fun of this game.

1771
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:15,079
Okay.

1772
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:16,600
Rest here for a few hours to regain...

1773
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:21,750
Yeah, let me actually do that.

1774
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:22,470
Okay, yeah.

1775
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:24,260
I got some stamina back, I'm all right.

1776
01:37:25,829 --> 01:37:26,789
Let's go up here.

1777
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:29,569
It's a little hut here.

1778
01:37:29,569 --> 01:37:30,609
I think I've been to the hut.

1779
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:37,939
It's also easier to be fair if you haven't taken a 297 day break.

1780
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:41,960
That's true.

1781
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:49,800
Now let's set up to that town.

1782
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,670
Okay.

1783
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:55,829
All right.

1784
01:37:57,909 --> 01:37:58,470
No, I don't think...

1785
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:59,350
I have not been up here.

1786
01:37:59,989 --> 01:38:07,729
You pick your way carefully over the rocks to the edge of a road.

1787
01:38:07,729 --> 01:38:09,890
The wind picks up as the evening draws on.

1788
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,170
Soon it will be dark.

1789
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:14,310
Towards the village.

1790
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:24,630
The path winds up through low foothills towards an open area in the mountains.

1791
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:27,510
As you approach the foothills, you see a wooden palisade.

1792
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:31,619
Spiked trunks planted to form a fence with a single gate.

1793
01:38:31,619 --> 01:38:36,119
From beyond comes the sound of chatting and banter and dogs.

1794
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:39,439
This must be the village the shepherd boy mentioned.

1795
01:38:39,439 --> 01:38:45,970
Remember that 300 days ago?

1796
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:51,250
The shepherd boy told us about this town up here, right?

1797
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,350
It was only a few weeks ago.

1798
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:57,569
It seems to be a bustling, busy place.

1799
01:38:57,569 --> 01:39:01,569
Presumably this village owns the fields and farmland through which you have been walking.

1800
01:39:01,569 --> 01:39:04,199
You could go in or skirt around it.

1801
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:07,560
We're going in.

1802
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:12,000
You pause on the other side of the gate.

1803
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,319
One hand on your sword hilt should anyone be foolish enough to spring a trap.

1804
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:17,729
But nothing un...

1805
01:39:18,449 --> 01:39:19,649
Nothing weird happens.

1806
01:39:19,649 --> 01:39:21,569
Nothing untoward happens.

1807
01:39:21,569 --> 01:39:26,399
The village is a small collection of wooden huts built into a basin

1808
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:28,479
within the mountains at its back.

1809
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:32,050
In the center is a fire pit surrounded by tables and benches.

1810
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:42,850
Several groups are sitting and eating.

1811
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:45,329
Pleasant smells drift over from the kitchen hut.

1812
01:39:45,329 --> 01:39:47,569
The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.

1813
01:39:47,569 --> 01:39:50,680
Oh boy.

1814
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,779
All right.

1815
01:39:51,779 --> 01:39:57,109
The fire, the kitchens, wait for nightfall.

1816
01:39:57,109 --> 01:40:02,050
I'm gonna go to the kitchens because I need food.

1817
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:04,960
Bad.

1818
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,279
In one corner of the village is a cook's hut.

1819
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:09,680
Inside a lady is stirring a deep cauldron.

1820
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,390
She looks up and nods to you through the doorway.

1821
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:14,789
Clouds begin to tumble across the dimming sky.

1822
01:40:14,789 --> 01:40:16,289
It will be dark soon.

1823
01:40:16,289 --> 01:40:18,949
Go inside.

1824
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:21,619
You step inside.

1825
01:40:21,619 --> 01:40:22,260
Greet the cook.

1826
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:23,060
Look into the cauldron.

1827
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:25,119
Let's greet the cook.

1828
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:27,670
Greetings, you declare.

1829
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:29,399
You're welcome.

1830
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:30,920
If there's something you want.

1831
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:33,479
If you don't want anything, there's the door.

1832
01:40:33,479 --> 01:40:38,130
The chef goes over to a shelf to collect some herbs from a jar.

1833
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:40,399
Look into the cauldron.

1834
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:41,439
You look into the cauldron.

1835
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:43,170
The cook is stirring.

1836
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:44,760
Meat broth.

1837
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:51,189
But if it looks like there isn't any meat, it's because it's snotty cat.

1838
01:40:51,189 --> 01:40:55,430
And they are invisible.

1839
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:57,270
When they have their eyes closed, that's right.

1840
01:40:58,039 --> 01:41:04,100
And since some close their eyes, when they die, you can end up with invisible meat.

1841
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,380
Everyone says it tastes nicer than the invisible kind.

1842
01:41:08,369 --> 01:41:09,960
I'm not so sure.

1843
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,800
It's certainly harder to cook right.

1844
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:16,210
The lady pours a little oil into the soup from a flask above the cauldron.

1845
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:19,199
Ask about the village.

1846
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:21,600
What caul?

1847
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,039
What caul you?

1848
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:24,880
What can you tell me of this village, you ask?

1849
01:41:26,850 --> 01:41:32,079
This is Kariyama, the main village in the fields of Ishtara.

1850
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:34,720
Where are you from if you don't know that already?

1851
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,239
I am stupid.

1852
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,479
You tell her, lying unskillfully.

1853
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:44,050
The chef raises an eyebrow but does not reply.

1854
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:47,829
A thin smell of smoke wafts into the tent.

1855
01:41:47,829 --> 01:41:49,350
Oh, by thruff.

1856
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:52,229
The cook curses and disappears through a flap at the back.

1857
01:41:52,229 --> 01:41:54,439
For a moment, you are alone.

1858
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:59,350
I mean, I'm taking a fucking free bowl of soup.

1859
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:02,600
While she is gone, you fill a bowl with soup and begin to eat.

1860
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,489
But it's too hot to finish all of it before she returns.

1861
01:42:09,399 --> 01:42:09,960
Pour it back in.

1862
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,800
Uh, eat it.

1863
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,840
You keep eating.

1864
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:17,000
She stares at you with surprise.

1865
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,020
You did not pay for that, she remarks.

1866
01:42:24,819 --> 01:42:25,460
Say nothing?

1867
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:33,170
No, I have, I gotta pay for it.

1868
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:36,789
Here, throw her four gold pieces.

1869
01:42:36,789 --> 01:42:39,430
You throw down four gold pieces.

1870
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:43,680
She takes them but looks clearly quite unhappy.

1871
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,279
There is nothing more of interest here.

1872
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:48,100
You nod to the chef, then turn and leave the hut.

1873
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:50,289
The sun is now in the lowest quarter of the sky.

1874
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:52,159
It'll be dark.

1875
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:52,960
All right, well, whatever.

1876
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,180
I bought the food.

1877
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:58,760
I'm fine.

1878
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:05,279
Go to the fire.

1879
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:07,439
The fire pit is in the center of the village.

1880
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:09,119
You walk past low huts.

1881
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:12,069
A few figures glance at you, but they show a little interest.

1882
01:43:12,069 --> 01:43:17,000
The fire is kept low and smoldering, ready to be reignited in the evening.

1883
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,449
A few people surround it, watching and talking.

1884
01:43:22,449 --> 01:43:24,920
Look, cook my raw food.

1885
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:29,319
You unwrap the portions of raw meat and fish you have been carrying and roast them in the fire.

1886
01:43:29,319 --> 01:43:31,560
Save it.

1887
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:33,920
You save your provisions they should keep well.

1888
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,359
Someone passes around a charred joint of meat, offering you a bite.

1889
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:44,340
That's really good, actually.

1890
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:47,359
I might just pass it on.

1891
01:43:47,359 --> 01:43:50,520
Because, is that...

1892
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:54,840
Would they see that as, wow, that's really nice of you because food is kind of scarce?

1893
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:58,279
Or, why did you refuse food, you piece of shit?

1894
01:43:58,279 --> 01:43:59,640
I'm going to eat it.

1895
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,010
You take a bite.

1896
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:04,930
The meat is black and sooty, but rich with flavors and spices.

1897
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:07,760
Eat the rest.

1898
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:10,229
I'm going to pass it.

1899
01:44:10,229 --> 01:44:15,250
Having taken your share, you pass the joint onto the next person.

1900
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:19,649
See what you did there, Steve Jackson.

1901
01:44:19,649 --> 01:44:24,180
Um, let's introduce myself.

1902
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:26,520
Greetings, you declare to the people nearby.

1903
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:29,960
They look up at you with some curiosity.

1904
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:32,199
What is this place?

1905
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:33,640
The lounging woman answers.

1906
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:38,529
This is Karima, the central village of all of Ishtara.

1907
01:44:38,529 --> 01:44:42,119
Then they seem to lose interest in you, and return to staring at the fire and talking to

1908
01:44:42,119 --> 01:44:43,560
each other in low voices.

1909
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,850
Throw a stick on the fire.

1910
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:51,970
I don't want to fuck with the fire, because this is their domain here.

1911
01:44:51,970 --> 01:44:55,250
In the base of the smoldering fire pit are a few pebbles and some sand.

1912
01:44:58,149 --> 01:44:59,430
Hold on a second here.

1913
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:05,670
Pebbles are for grenades.

1914
01:45:06,229 --> 01:45:08,680
What is sand for?

1915
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:18,119
Yeah, see, pebbles for pop.

1916
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:19,909
What, sand?

1917
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:29,600
Ah, I feel like both of these can be pretty effective.

1918
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,159
But I think I'm taking the pebbles.

1919
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,239
Take a pebble.

1920
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:40,180
You move to reach into the pit and then pause.

1921
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:42,260
There's still plenty of heat coming from the fire.

1922
01:45:42,819 --> 01:45:45,680
Take another one.

1923
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:49,409
You reach in and close your fist around a pebble, but it is burning hot.

1924
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:53,010
You snatch your hand back, a heavy red burn on your palm.

1925
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:57,729
It's not only painful, but since this is your sword arm, it will lower your ability to fight.

1926
01:45:57,729 --> 01:45:58,689
And I don't have a finger.

1927
01:46:00,069 --> 01:46:00,949
Ranger!

1928
01:46:00,949 --> 01:46:02,239
One of the villagers declares.

1929
01:46:03,109 --> 01:46:04,310
We were having a discussion.

1930
01:46:04,869 --> 01:46:08,789
Who would be most likely to best the other in a fight?

1931
01:46:08,789 --> 01:46:10,789
A goblin or a wolf?

1932
01:46:10,789 --> 01:46:14,420
I have seen such a fight.

1933
01:46:15,489 --> 01:46:16,210
Surely the wolf.

1934
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:21,000
The goblin.

1935
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,270
Um, it's probably the wolf.

1936
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,920
Surely the wolf.

1937
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,279
You answer cheerfully.

1938
01:46:27,279 --> 01:46:29,359
It has wild strength and claws.

1939
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:32,920
But a goblin has cunning and swordsmanship.

1940
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:36,289
I have killed many of both.

1941
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:38,210
Wolves are fearful creatures at heart.

1942
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:39,800
You'll have to try it.

1943
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:45,760
I have killed many of both.

1944
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,880
We will ask the archmage to deliver one of each.

1945
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,460
Decides a villager with a sigh.

1946
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:54,869
In the name of learning and scholarship.

1947
01:46:54,869 --> 01:46:55,750
Uh oh.

1948
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:59,960
These are archmage enthusiasts.

1949
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:03,810
What is north of this village?

1950
01:47:06,659 --> 01:47:07,619
Tunnels.

1951
01:47:07,619 --> 01:47:08,640
One replies.

1952
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:11,119
A few others look uncomfortable.

1953
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:12,319
There are tunnels.

1954
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:15,060
We don't go in there.

1955
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:17,439
Why not?

1956
01:47:20,279 --> 01:47:21,399
Because there is no need.

1957
01:47:22,199 --> 01:47:23,960
And there are some dangers.

1958
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:26,659
Wolves?

1959
01:47:26,659 --> 01:47:27,300
Goblins?

1960
01:47:28,289 --> 01:47:28,789
Wolves?

1961
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:33,600
Something lives there.

1962
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:36,800
There's no danger here in Karayama.

1963
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:39,060
The archmage keeps us quite safe.

1964
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,720
But under the mountain, well...

1965
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:46,760
They say magic doesn't work under the mountain.

1966
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:50,739
Where do the tunnels lead?

1967
01:47:50,739 --> 01:47:53,729
The villagers shake their heads.

1968
01:47:53,729 --> 01:47:55,090
One points sharply downwards.

1969
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:56,770
But beyond that they do not answer.

1970
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,340
Enough questions.

1971
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,340
Please don't go to the tunnels.

1972
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:04,659
We have no wish to send you to your doom.

1973
01:48:04,659 --> 01:48:08,960
Okay.

1974
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,109
Talk to someone.

1975
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:13,670
You sit down beside the woman who spoke earlier.

1976
01:48:13,670 --> 01:48:15,989
She nods in acknowledgement but says nothing.

1977
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:19,670
This is a beautiful village.

1978
01:48:21,829 --> 01:48:25,720
The woman smiles and then pauses to tighten a bootlace.

1979
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:30,119
A movement which casually flashes the marriage band on her wrist.

1980
01:48:30,119 --> 01:48:31,920
Thank you stranger.

1981
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,380
We all welcome you.

1982
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:39,000
This village is Karayama, the most beautiful village in Ishtara.

1983
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:39,800
Enough talk.

1984
01:48:40,199 --> 01:48:42,550
Give me that thing to drink.

1985
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:43,750
Wicked fast.

1986
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:51,239
How might one cross the horns of Iklala?

1987
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:57,350
You are so eager to leave already.

1988
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:58,390
There's the bridge.

1989
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:00,789
You'll have to pay the bridge keeper his toll of course.

1990
01:49:00,789 --> 01:49:02,710
But he rarely asks too much.

1991
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:06,630
Is there another way?

1992
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,310
I've heard it said that there are tunnels.

1993
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:10,819
But they were all blocked up because of the pests.

1994
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:13,409
What pests?

1995
01:49:13,409 --> 01:49:14,449
Invisible creatures.

1996
01:49:14,449 --> 01:49:17,729
They came in the night and stole our goats.

1997
01:49:17,729 --> 01:49:20,210
She kicks at the fire with one foot.

1998
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,329
You talk a lot.

1999
01:49:21,329 --> 01:49:23,010
Is that normal where you're from?

2000
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:27,199
I rarely see people.

2001
01:49:27,279 --> 01:49:29,520
I'm just trying to get my social meter up a little.

2002
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,039
You're all strangely quiet.

2003
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:38,050
Or so it seems to me.

2004
01:49:38,050 --> 01:49:39,909
We are a small village.

2005
01:49:39,909 --> 01:49:41,750
We see each other every day.

2006
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:44,100
There's not that much to discuss.

2007
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:45,600
You travel alone?

2008
01:49:48,609 --> 01:49:53,350
I do.

2009
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:00,529
Well you are amongst us should you wish to stay.

2010
01:50:00,529 --> 01:50:03,649
Ishtara is the center of the world.

2011
01:50:03,649 --> 01:50:05,409
We will survive forever.

2012
01:50:05,409 --> 01:50:08,340
I do not think so.

2013
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:11,939
You reply thinking of the empty waste you have already seen.

2014
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:15,909
The woman looks at you curiously but does not reply.

2015
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:17,350
Yeah, because this is back in the past.

2016
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:19,970
So I know it's a wasteland now.

2017
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:20,770
Survive.

2018
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:21,250
Come on.

2019
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:22,369
I'm talking a lot.

2020
01:50:22,369 --> 01:50:24,979
What can you tell me about the backlands?

2021
01:50:24,979 --> 01:50:27,380
The backlands?

2022
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:32,850
That name seems unfamiliar to her.

2023
01:50:32,850 --> 01:50:33,649
Oh, okay.

2024
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:35,409
It is of no importance.

2025
01:50:35,409 --> 01:50:39,810
It seems wherever you are this place is far removed from Kakabad.

2026
01:50:39,810 --> 01:50:43,189
At least for these people.

2027
01:50:43,189 --> 01:50:44,630
I'll throw a stick on the fire.

2028
01:50:44,630 --> 01:50:49,010
You toss a nearby stick into the fire and it begins to gently smoke and smolder.

2029
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:50,770
There's a great sense of peace here.

2030
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:54,819
You stand and nod to the woman as you head away from the fireside.

2031
01:50:54,819 --> 01:50:58,199
The sun is almost set and the sky has turned a deep purple.

2032
01:50:58,199 --> 01:51:01,539
Okay.

2033
01:51:01,539 --> 01:51:03,199
We've eaten.

2034
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:04,479
Got a lot of rations.

2035
01:51:04,479 --> 01:51:05,510
Let's wait.

2036
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:12,149
You pass a few hours in idling around the village until the sun dips behind the towering mountains

2037
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:16,479
and the air grows cold.

2038
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:17,760
Sleeping hut.

2039
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:25,140
You head towards the large hut that is filled with mattresses and cots.

2040
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:29,699
Seems to be not an inn but a communal sleeping place.

2041
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:31,699
A few people are already asleep here.

2042
01:51:31,699 --> 01:51:35,569
I feel like this is potentially dangerous.

2043
01:51:35,569 --> 01:51:38,630
I feel like someone's going to steal something or attack me.

2044
01:51:38,630 --> 01:51:42,630
But I think I take my chances.

2045
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:44,710
You choose a mattress and settle down.

2046
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:46,949
You lie still for a while with your eyes closed,

2047
01:51:46,949 --> 01:51:50,659
listening to the murmured conversations of other people in the hut.

2048
01:51:50,659 --> 01:51:54,359
Amidst sundries about village life, one in particular stands out.

2049
01:51:54,359 --> 01:51:57,890
A young girl, murmuring to her friend,

2050
01:51:57,890 --> 01:52:00,369
At least one of the tunnels is still open.

2051
01:52:00,369 --> 01:52:04,850
Don't be a fool, Mia.

2052
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:05,970
The other replies,

2053
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:07,409
Why would there be tunnels?

2054
01:52:07,409 --> 01:52:11,010
So the goblins can come in?

2055
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:12,529
I'm telling you, I saw one.

2056
01:52:12,529 --> 01:52:13,090
I went in.

2057
01:52:13,569 --> 01:52:16,680
Another voice nearby hisses at them to be quiet.

2058
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:20,210
What do you know about...

2059
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:21,890
Hey, what do you...

2060
01:52:21,890 --> 01:52:23,489
What do you kids know about tunnels?

2061
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:29,279
You rise from your cot and find the one called Mia.

2062
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:31,600
My apologies for overhearing your conversation.

2063
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:34,640
These tunnels sound most interesting.

2064
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:38,600
Do not be afraid, you assure her.

2065
01:52:39,239 --> 01:52:41,399
I'm merely an interested traveler.

2066
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:44,050
The girl's friend has rolled over

2067
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:46,289
and is pretending to have been asleep all this time.

2068
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:49,890
I don't know anything about tunnels.

2069
01:52:49,890 --> 01:52:50,770
Please leave me alone.

2070
01:52:52,579 --> 01:52:55,840
I'm, um, I'm sorry.

2071
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:57,760
I have money.

2072
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,409
Important that you tell me.

2073
01:52:59,409 --> 01:53:13,619
I have money.

2074
01:53:13,619 --> 01:53:16,310
I can pay you for information you tell her.

2075
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:18,369
Her eyes grow round with fear.

2076
01:53:19,699 --> 01:53:20,420
Who are you?

2077
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:21,300
What are you doing here?

2078
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:26,479
I am a sorcerer of great power.

2079
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:30,640
Are you working for the goblins?

2080
01:53:32,130 --> 01:53:33,329
Are you a goblin?

2081
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:35,170
Are you leading an invasion?

2082
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:37,140
What? No.

2083
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:40,819
Is an invasion expected?

2084
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:44,399
My parents say the only reason we're still alive

2085
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,880
is that the mountains are tall and goblins are short.

2086
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:50,319
But goblins dig so they'll get us in the end.

2087
01:53:52,319 --> 01:53:53,760
Why are you asking about the tunnels?

2088
01:53:56,119 --> 01:53:58,550
I wish to protect the village.

2089
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:01,430
The tunnels are a weakness that must be defended.

2090
01:54:04,149 --> 01:54:06,310
I'll take you tomorrow.

2091
01:54:06,869 --> 01:54:08,229
She kicks her friend.

2092
01:54:08,229 --> 01:54:09,109
I'll take both of you.

2093
01:54:10,119 --> 01:54:11,479
You nod and return to your cot.

2094
01:54:12,279 --> 01:54:14,119
There we go.

2095
01:54:14,119 --> 01:54:16,500
I'll eat something.

2096
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,489
You eat a hunk of cooked meat and feel a little better.

2097
01:54:19,489 --> 01:54:20,930
All right, now we're doing better.

2098
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:23,079
Then you stretch out and rest.

2099
01:54:23,079 --> 01:54:28,000
You are unharmed here and you do not dream.

2100
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,119
All right, we're going to get some information to go through the tunnels.

2101
01:54:34,119 --> 01:54:36,199
You gain provisions, lost some gold,

2102
01:54:36,199 --> 01:54:39,159
enter the village of Kariyama, found no meat food.

2103
01:54:39,159 --> 01:54:44,130
The sun rises through the flaps of the hut.

2104
01:54:44,130 --> 01:54:48,000
The girl and her friend wake quickly and gesture at you to follow.

2105
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,350
Follow them.

2106
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:55,270
You follow them out of the hut and through the northern gate of the village.

2107
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:56,149
Oh dear.

2108
01:54:56,149 --> 01:55:01,409
I hope I can protect these two.

2109
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:07,319
The girl Mia leads you up to a tunnel mouth a short distance above the village.

2110
01:55:07,319 --> 01:55:09,399
Carefully hidden behind an outcrop of stone.

2111
01:55:09,399 --> 01:55:12,550
This used to be a mine.

2112
01:55:12,550 --> 01:55:15,350
Only they had to stop mining on account of the things.

2113
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:18,000
I will kill the things.

2114
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,439
You tell her.

2115
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:20,960
The girl only shakes her head.

2116
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:25,729
You think you're the first idiot with a sword to go in there?

2117
01:55:25,729 --> 01:55:29,090
But if you see my dog, give it a tickle for me.

2118
01:55:30,770 --> 01:55:31,569
Your dog?

2119
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:37,680
Your dog lives in there?

2120
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:40,239
My dog ran away in there, she says.

2121
01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:41,279
She never came back.

2122
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:42,960
She sits down on a nearby rock.

2123
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,560
Well, that's what I did.

2124
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,600
I said it out loud.

2125
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:57,760
Well, okay, into the tunnel.

2126
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:03,640
You approach the tunnel mouth and lift away the covering of vines.

2127
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:08,420
The passage descends dank and dark into the bowels of the mountains beyond.

2128
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:13,939
I think I need to strike a light here.

2129
01:56:13,939 --> 01:56:17,220
I have Tinder, don't I?

2130
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:17,779
Yep.

2131
01:56:17,779 --> 01:56:20,319
Your Tinder box can provide a spark.

2132
01:56:20,319 --> 01:56:22,159
You look through your pack for something to catch a light.

2133
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:24,960
I'm not doing that.

2134
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,199
Burn the spell book.

2135
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:31,479
By the way, it's gone forever and you can't get it back.

2136
01:56:31,479 --> 01:56:32,760
Why would I burn my...

2137
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,119
No, do something else.

2138
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:35,640
That's so stupid that you can do that.

2139
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,119
I love it.

2140
01:56:42,149 --> 01:56:43,189
Oh, I can't see.

2141
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:47,109
Might as well burn the most important item in my backpack.

2142
01:56:47,109 --> 01:56:50,260
You cannot burn the spell book.

2143
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:53,569
You'll have to find some other fuel or go without flame.

2144
01:56:53,569 --> 01:56:54,369
Just go.

2145
01:56:54,369 --> 01:56:56,609
I think I have a sun jewel.

2146
01:56:56,609 --> 01:57:01,250
The mountains overhead create an imposing sight.

2147
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:04,529
You walk as though into an ancient tomb.

2148
01:57:04,529 --> 01:57:06,930
Even the air smells musty and old.

2149
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:08,899
But there is a breeze on your hand.

2150
01:57:08,899 --> 01:57:18,840
Does that mean that there is a way through below ground?

2151
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,600
Magic doesn't work under here.

2152
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:21,560
Oh, that's right.

2153
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:26,630
You make your way slowly through the narrow entrance.

2154
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:28,930
And into the cool dark of the tunnel.

2155
01:57:28,930 --> 01:57:33,199
You hold out a hand to feel your way forward.

2156
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:34,420
Cast a spell.

2157
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:38,020
You raise your eyes up but it seems this deep below the mountain.

2158
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:42,689
The presence of the starlight, kid, cannot reach you.

2159
01:57:42,689 --> 01:57:47,119
You're powerless, dude.

2160
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:49,279
You try to make out something of the tunnel walls.

2161
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:55,720
But the darkness is absolute.

2162
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,460
Call out.

2163
01:57:57,460 --> 01:58:00,359
Is anyone there?

2164
01:58:00,359 --> 01:58:01,239
There is no response.

2165
01:58:01,239 --> 01:58:03,170
Not even an echo.

2166
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:08,279
You follow the cold stone with your fingertips.

2167
01:58:08,279 --> 01:58:11,720
I'm gonna get out of here.

2168
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:12,920
You stumble onwards.

2169
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,000
Squinting in the gloom.

2170
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,609
The tunnel winds on a steady course.

2171
01:58:18,609 --> 01:58:21,510
With occasional branches that lead to dead ends.

2172
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:24,319
It becomes clear this is not a natural cavern.

2173
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:27,439
Wooden pillars line the walls, creaking under the weight of stone.

2174
01:58:27,439 --> 01:58:29,890
Test the pillars.

2175
01:58:29,890 --> 01:58:33,810
You test one of the pillars for strength applying a little pressure.

2176
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:36,529
It responds with a crunching, cracking sound.

2177
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:39,569
And dust rains down in a spill.

2178
01:58:39,569 --> 01:58:42,689
So am I going to crush my head?

2179
01:58:42,689 --> 01:58:44,930
Push the pillar.

2180
01:58:44,930 --> 01:58:47,489
You put your weight against the pillar and heave.

2181
01:58:47,489 --> 01:58:52,359
The ancient wood cracks gratefully and rocks begin to tumble from the roof overhead.

2182
01:58:52,359 --> 01:58:54,369
You dash madly through the tunnel.

2183
01:58:56,789 --> 01:58:59,510
No, rewind, rewind, rewind, rewind.

2184
01:58:59,510 --> 01:59:00,960
That doesn't count.

2185
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:05,539
Test the pillars.

2186
01:59:05,539 --> 01:59:10,399
Okay, press on.

2187
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:11,039
Deeper.

2188
01:59:11,039 --> 01:59:18,960
Being careful not to lean on the pillar.

2189
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:25,439
You keep one hand on the wall to your left and allow it to guide you.

2190
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:28,319
Then your foot strikes something hard.

2191
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:29,989
Not a rock.

2192
01:59:29,989 --> 01:59:31,909
A length of metal, perhaps.

2193
01:59:31,909 --> 01:59:33,840
Reach for it.

2194
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,380
You reach down and feel for the object.

2195
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:40,739
A long metal spike with a wooden pole at its center.

2196
01:59:40,739 --> 01:59:42,079
A pickaxe.

2197
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:43,840
Someone has been mining down here.

2198
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:47,649
A few steps further on you collide into a wooden wall

2199
01:59:47,649 --> 01:59:50,470
that reaches from knee height to neck height.

2200
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:52,210
It appears to be on wheels.

2201
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:53,329
A mine cart then.

2202
01:59:53,329 --> 01:59:57,119
Feel inside the cart.

2203
01:59:57,119 --> 02:00:00,640
You reach over and into the cart, hoping to find some treasure or valuable metal.

2204
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:02,050
But it is empty.

2205
02:00:02,050 --> 02:00:07,430
There's not even any discarded rock.

2206
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:09,760
Let's push it.

2207
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:13,270
You push at the cart but it must have been here for an age.

2208
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:16,520
It moves an inch and then the wheels stick fast.

2209
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:20,039
The squeal of rusted iron echoes in the chamber like a scream.

2210
02:00:20,039 --> 02:00:22,920
Let's go.

2211
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:25,890
You put your shoulder to the cart and push hard.

2212
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:29,859
It overcomes whatever was catching on the wheel and begins to roll quickly forward.

2213
02:00:29,859 --> 02:00:33,359
A moment later it strikes something in the darkness.

2214
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:35,359
One of the support pillars, perhaps?

2215
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:37,439
Dust begins to trickle from the ceiling.

2216
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:40,630
Wait to see what happens.

2217
02:00:40,630 --> 02:00:46,739
You stand frozen to the spot as the cavern echoes with ship-like yawns and creaks.

2218
02:00:46,739 --> 02:00:50,449
The stone shifts and fractures overhead and then falls silent.

2219
02:00:50,449 --> 02:00:52,869
The roof does not collapse this time.

2220
02:00:52,869 --> 02:00:56,210
You inch on through the darkness moving more cautiously now.

2221
02:00:56,210 --> 02:00:58,069
We're good.

2222
02:00:58,069 --> 02:01:04,210
You make your way slowly through the dark.

2223
02:01:04,210 --> 02:01:06,369
Soon your hand feels nothing but air.

2224
02:01:06,369 --> 02:01:07,729
A side passage.

2225
02:01:07,729 --> 02:01:12,640
The passage.

2226
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:16,479
Empty darkness leads in three directions.

2227
02:01:16,479 --> 02:01:19,279
Is the ape here?

2228
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:20,560
The ape is here.

2229
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:24,659
Toss a stone into the passage.

2230
02:01:24,659 --> 02:01:26,500
Shout out or pray to the ape.

2231
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:30,600
Okay.

2232
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:32,039
This is very clearly.

2233
02:01:32,039 --> 02:01:34,949
This is a boss room, right?

2234
02:01:34,949 --> 02:01:37,090
There's a fog door here.

2235
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:37,489
This is a...

2236
02:01:40,149 --> 02:01:40,789
I'm gonna go in there.

2237
02:01:40,789 --> 02:01:41,270
That's a...

2238
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:48,500
Pray for protection.

2239
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:53,250
You close your eyes and raise a prayer to the ape.

2240
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:55,300
Nothing happens.

2241
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:57,600
Have you been forgotten in the dark?

2242
02:01:57,600 --> 02:02:04,560
But as your eyes adjust, you notice something dimly glowing at the end of the side passage.

2243
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:08,520
Is it the ape?

2244
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:15,840
Move towards the glowing object.

2245
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:19,590
You edge down the passage, your footsteps muffled by thick sand.

2246
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:30,640
You trip over more abandoned and broken tools.

2247
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:35,989
Then you're close enough to see a curved, golden object pointing from a pile of rubble.

2248
02:02:35,989 --> 02:02:39,810
This is the source of the light, which is pulsing softly.

2249
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:43,970
Beside the pile of rubble are two large shapes that look like jars.

2250
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:47,359
Scream!

2251
02:02:48,079 --> 02:02:55,319
Open up one of the jars and scream into it.

2252
02:02:55,319 --> 02:02:56,039
Uh...

2253
02:02:56,039 --> 02:03:04,800
Get a closer look at the artifact.

2254
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:09,760
You edge around the jars as you get closer to the artifact.

2255
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:10,800
It is a horn.

2256
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:17,430
The dim glow makes the rest of the cavern dark and you trip and stumble as you approach.

2257
02:03:17,430 --> 02:03:23,199
Whatever it is, it is clear it is infused with magic and must be quite valuable.

2258
02:03:23,199 --> 02:03:27,380
But it seems to have been only halfway freed from the rock.

2259
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:32,159
The wall feels smoother in places, like you're feeling a built wall instead of a tunnel.

2260
02:03:32,850 --> 02:03:34,770
The ground here also feels different.

2261
02:03:34,770 --> 02:03:40,289
I'm gonna grab the horn, it's gonna be attached to something.

2262
02:03:40,289 --> 02:03:49,199
Shift the rocks?

2263
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:50,720
Move the jars aside?

2264
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:53,619
Shift the rocks.

2265
02:03:53,619 --> 02:04:00,739
You squat down and move some rocks away from the artifact, all but dazzled by its light.

2266
02:04:00,739 --> 02:04:03,619
The glow is only gentle, but down here it is blinding.

2267
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:06,609
Pull it free.

2268
02:04:06,609 --> 02:04:08,850
It's gonna be attached to something.

2269
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:14,500
You grab the part of the horn that protrudes from the wall and pull, but it is firmly stuck.

2270
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:15,920
Yank it!

2271
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,880
You haul a little harder and it comes free suddenly,

2272
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:22,289
sending you sprawling back across the sandy floor.

2273
02:04:22,289 --> 02:04:25,350
Blow the horn!

2274
02:04:25,350 --> 02:04:27,109
Let's not do that immediately.

2275
02:04:27,109 --> 02:04:28,149
Let's look at it.

2276
02:04:28,149 --> 02:04:32,630
You waste no time in examining the horn.

2277
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:37,239
Hard to see any details as the glow blinds you in the darkness.

2278
02:04:37,239 --> 02:04:43,039
But you do make out some blocky script carved into it in a language you don't recognize.

2279
02:04:43,039 --> 02:04:47,779
The horn is also slightly warm to the touch.

2280
02:04:47,779 --> 02:04:48,739
Blow the horn.

2281
02:04:48,739 --> 02:04:54,289
You put the horn to your lips and blow.

2282
02:04:54,289 --> 02:04:55,409
Nothing happens.

2283
02:04:55,409 --> 02:04:58,819
It is as though the horn is blocked.

2284
02:04:58,819 --> 02:05:03,239
As you tip it up to empty it, you notice the nearest clay jar wobbling.

2285
02:05:03,239 --> 02:05:05,880
It rocks back and forth faster and faster.

2286
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:08,180
Then the lid shoots off.

2287
02:05:08,180 --> 02:05:09,439
Cover my head.

2288
02:05:09,439 --> 02:05:14,960
You cover your head, but the lid strikes the low roof with such force it turns to powder.

2289
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:17,439
But the real danger is just beginning.

2290
02:05:17,439 --> 02:05:20,720
Sand rushes out of the jar with tremendous force,

2291
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:22,960
whipping around the cavern tripping you to the ground.

2292
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:26,449
Scramble back.

2293
02:05:26,449 --> 02:05:29,729
You scramble backwards across the ground trying to get away

2294
02:05:29,729 --> 02:05:33,199
As the sand forms into a whirlpool-like shape,

2295
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:38,319
two deep black vortices appear in its sides and roam queasily across the surface until

2296
02:05:38,319 --> 02:05:39,670
they reach the top.

2297
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:47,840
There they swivel, widen, and seem to focus on you.

2298
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:52,800
You deftly leap forward and swing your sword, but it passes clean through the monster.

2299
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:55,090
It barely even notices.

2300
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:56,609
Uh, look for something to use.

2301
02:05:56,609 --> 02:06:00,850
The pickaxe.

2302
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:07,270
You cast about looking for some advantage and your eye lands on a discarded pickaxe.

2303
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:08,949
I can't hurt- that's not gonna do anything.

2304
02:06:08,949 --> 02:06:10,770
I gotta run.

2305
02:06:10,770 --> 02:06:13,170
Surely a pickaxe cannot harm this thing.

2306
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:15,970
You turn, intending to run, and the creature follows you.

2307
02:06:15,970 --> 02:06:20,180
The vortex passes the discarded pickaxe and gathers it up

2308
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:24,659
until handle and head swirling around inside of its body at violent speed

2309
02:06:24,659 --> 02:06:28,659
before being smashed to pieces and spraying in all directions.

2310
02:06:28,659 --> 02:06:31,109
The sand vortex is very close now.

2311
02:06:31,109 --> 02:06:33,859
It is cornering you against a pillar.

2312
02:06:33,859 --> 02:06:37,460
Looking around wildly in the dark, you can't think of anything.

2313
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:40,340
You take a few steps back and feel hard stone at your back.

2314
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:41,779
The creature expands.

2315
02:06:41,779 --> 02:06:44,229
Is this how it ends?

2316
02:06:44,229 --> 02:06:46,420
Shield yourself.

2317
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:48,739
You cover your head, expecting the fatal blow.

2318
02:06:48,739 --> 02:06:55,060
But before the creature can strike, the tunnel rumbles with holy vengeance.

2319
02:06:55,060 --> 02:06:57,699
Rocks crash down from the ceiling, burying it.

2320
02:06:57,699 --> 02:06:59,380
You've been saved by the ape!

2321
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:01,460
But the tunnel rumble-

2322
02:07:02,899 --> 02:07:04,659
But the rumble is still there.

2323
02:07:04,659 --> 02:07:09,890
A few more boulders crash, narrowly, just barely missing your ass.

2324
02:07:09,890 --> 02:07:11,909
The tunnel is collapsing with you in it.

2325
02:07:11,909 --> 02:07:18,180
Good thing we prayed.

2326
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:20,399
Run.

2327
02:07:20,399 --> 02:07:22,960
You dodge aside as rocks crash down around you.

2328
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,640
The creature is close behind.

2329
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:27,600
But then the ceiling caves in at your heels, burying it.

2330
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:31,840
In your haste, you trip on a broken cart and the glowing horn goes flying.

2331
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,720
It lands nearby, but the tunnel is still rumbling.

2332
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:36,850
I have to get it.

2333
02:07:36,850 --> 02:07:39,250
You leap towards the horn, landing on your knees.

2334
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:45,250
You reach out, but not before a massive rock slams on it, grinding the horn into fine powder.

2335
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:46,199
What?

2336
02:07:46,199 --> 02:07:50,039
Whatever secrets the miners were looking for will have to stay buried now.

2337
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:51,880
There's no time for disappointment.

2338
02:07:52,130 --> 02:07:54,600
Though as the ceiling is still caving in.

2339
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:55,079
What?

2340
02:07:55,079 --> 02:07:56,479
Roll left.

2341
02:07:56,479 --> 02:07:58,880
You wince as the ceiling crashes down, missing you by inches.

2342
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:00,640
Dust settles and you can't hear anything.

2343
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:02,000
There's no turning back now.

2344
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,279
You're trapped in the dark.

2345
02:08:03,279 --> 02:08:08,100
Snort the powder.

2346
02:08:11,699 --> 02:08:13,859
I have to have whatever secrets it is.

2347
02:08:13,859 --> 02:08:17,220
You slam your head, as hard as you can, into the ground.

2348
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:19,939
And breathe in as deeply with your nostrils as possible.

2349
02:08:23,239 --> 02:08:28,079
A sense of wind fills inside of your stomach.

2350
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:29,039
Uh, okay.

2351
02:08:29,039 --> 02:08:30,630
Can I still get-

2352
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:31,270
No.

2353
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:35,729
It's over.

2354
02:08:35,729 --> 02:08:37,699
You are in pitch darkness.

2355
02:08:37,699 --> 02:08:40,020
Whether it is night or day, it is impossible to tell.

2356
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:41,779
The air is freezing cold.

2357
02:08:41,779 --> 02:08:46,470
Strike a light.

2358
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:48,960
I'm not gonna burn my spell book.

2359
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:54,149
You feel about until you find the tunnel wall.

2360
02:08:54,149 --> 02:08:55,029
Cast a spell?

2361
02:08:55,029 --> 02:09:00,000
I can't cast spells down here.

2362
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,029
I need to just follow.

2363
02:09:03,029 --> 02:09:08,680
You follow the rough stone wall, stumbling and tripping until you come to a blockage.

2364
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:10,439
Feel the stones.

2365
02:09:10,439 --> 02:09:16,340
You feel your way across the stones, hoping to find a chink or a hole, but there's nothing.

2366
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:18,899
Sound of something groaning echoes down the tunnel length.

2367
02:09:18,899 --> 02:09:22,100
Strike a light.

2368
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:24,640
I'm not burning the spell book.

2369
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:29,090
You cannot burn the spell book, you'll have to find some other fuel.

2370
02:09:29,090 --> 02:09:30,100
All right.

2371
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:30,659
The other way.

2372
02:09:30,659 --> 02:09:33,119
Am I stuck down here?

2373
02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:34,159
You trace the wall the other way.

2374
02:09:34,159 --> 02:09:36,159
The passageway curves immense.

2375
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:38,640
The going is difficult with lots of dead ends.

2376
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:40,800
Then finally, a chink of daylight appears.

2377
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:43,119
It's like water after a long thirst.

2378
02:09:43,119 --> 02:09:47,909
You have found the tunnel mouth.

2379
02:09:47,909 --> 02:09:48,869
Leave the tunnel.

2380
02:09:48,869 --> 02:09:52,359
You hurry gratefully out of the tunnel into the soft damp air.

2381
02:09:52,359 --> 02:09:53,960
Where are you?

2382
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:55,909
Outside.

2383
02:09:55,909 --> 02:09:56,409
Ah!

2384
02:10:00,689 --> 02:10:08,800
This is- you can get up through this way, okay.

2385
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,560
I want that horn so bad.

2386
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:16,449
Oh well.

2387
02:10:16,449 --> 02:10:21,489
You emerge blinking from the underground tunnel to find yourself on the edge of a vast, deep forest.

2388
02:10:21,489 --> 02:10:26,500
From the position of the sun, you can see that you're on the other side of the Badubak Ridge.

2389
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:30,020
Only one way forward into the trees.

2390
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:32,760
So, you could go this way.

2391
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:35,090
You could also go all the way up here and do all this.

2392
02:10:35,090 --> 02:10:36,210
Didn't get the horn.

2393
02:10:36,210 --> 02:10:37,090
That's disappointing.

2394
02:10:37,090 --> 02:10:39,090
I wonder if there's anything else I missed up here.

2395
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:41,779
It is what it is.

2396
02:10:41,779 --> 02:10:43,890
The ape saved us.

2397
02:10:43,890 --> 02:10:47,560
Probably would have died.

2398
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:48,199
Very cool.

2399
02:10:48,199 --> 02:10:53,270
Can't go back to the village either.

2400
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:56,960
We're going to move on this way.

2401
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:00,960
Uh, I'm going to go check this out.

2402
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:05,359
Very big town here.

2403
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:10,649
This way.

2404
02:11:12,279 --> 02:11:16,239
No horn and no dog.

2405
02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:21,859
Yeah, I didn't find the dog and I didn't, um, I didn't get the horn either.

2406
02:11:21,859 --> 02:11:22,979
Forest turns to marsh.

2407
02:11:22,979 --> 02:11:28,100
The ground underfoot turns to slop until you are sinking a few fingers deep with every step.

2408
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:30,630
The smell of rot and decay fills the air.

2409
02:11:30,630 --> 02:11:32,789
Let's keep going.

2410
02:11:32,789 --> 02:11:35,890
You keep up your pace, hoping the ground will grow firmer further on.

2411
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:45,000
So, we're going back to the present.

2412
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,039
And no ring either.

2413
02:11:46,039 --> 02:11:46,600
I know.

2414
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:47,779
What a failure.

2415
02:11:47,779 --> 02:11:55,090
So, this was in the past and now we're back into the present.

2416
02:11:56,850 --> 02:11:57,810
What is this?

2417
02:11:57,810 --> 02:12:01,699
No horn, no dog, no ring, no finger.

2418
02:12:11,239 --> 02:12:12,789
Uh, no.

2419
02:12:14,949 --> 02:12:22,210
I just spilled all over myself.

2420
02:12:22,210 --> 02:12:29,569
You wade on through the marsh which changes to firmer earth beneath your feet.

2421
02:12:29,569 --> 02:12:33,489
Trees grow up around you and suddenly you find yourself in the forest once more.

2422
02:12:33,489 --> 02:12:37,119
The sun has reached its highest point now.

2423
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:39,680
Out of the shade, the air is baking hot.

2424
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:44,630
By day, the forest is still not a hospitable place, but it's beautiful in its own way.

2425
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:47,699
Water drips down the leaves and along twisted vines.

2426
02:12:47,699 --> 02:12:51,140
Birds flutter through the bracken-like canopy.

2427
02:12:51,140 --> 02:12:53,189
Everything is moist and damp.

2428
02:12:53,189 --> 02:12:56,369
The path is winding and frequently disappears.

2429
02:12:56,369 --> 02:12:59,670
Perhaps it has been made by animals and not by people.

2430
02:12:59,670 --> 02:13:03,810
Let's climb a tree.

2431
02:13:03,810 --> 02:13:08,680
You find a suitable looking tree, close at hand, and swing yourself onto the lower branch.

2432
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:13,039
From there, it is a reasonably straightforward climb up into the canopy.

2433
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:21,109
You reach the top of the tree, but there is no view.

2434
02:13:21,109 --> 02:13:25,199
From here, you can see nothing but more trees stretching away into the distance.

2435
02:13:25,199 --> 02:13:26,720
The only exception is to the south,

2436
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:30,640
where the stone arch of the bridge rises up in a dizzying height into the air.

2437
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:32,560
There is little else to be done up here.

2438
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:36,359
Look at the ground.

2439
02:13:36,359 --> 02:13:41,680
You glance down the tree towards the ground just as something moves past on the path below.

2440
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:43,439
Leaves stir, the shape is gone.

2441
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:46,369
You make your way carefully back down to the ground,

2442
02:13:46,369 --> 02:13:50,600
but halfway down, one of the branches cracks under your weight.

2443
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:52,079
Cling on.

2444
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:55,359
You cling onto the branch overhead as your foothold disappears.

2445
02:13:55,359 --> 02:13:59,560
For a moment, you are dangling free.

2446
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:01,520
Swing to a branch.

2447
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:03,039
Moving like a monkey.

2448
02:14:04,130 --> 02:14:05,439
Thank you, ape.

2449
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:08,000
You swing backwards and forwards until you have enough arc

2450
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,979
to try and catch another branch with your feet.

2451
02:14:10,979 --> 02:14:12,739
You hook yourself into position,

2452
02:14:12,739 --> 02:14:17,989
and then move one of your hands closer until you are steadily placed once more.

2453
02:14:17,989 --> 02:14:19,560
Okay.

2454
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:21,569
You take a moment to gather your breath.

2455
02:14:21,569 --> 02:14:29,760
In the pause, the branch underneath you breaks and you fall, of course.

2456
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:33,279
You hit the ground with a thump, but the earth is soft.

2457
02:14:33,279 --> 02:14:36,050
You are fortunately unhurt.

2458
02:14:36,050 --> 02:14:41,409
Near the foot of the tree is a broken branch and a slightly bruised bomba fruit.

2459
02:14:41,409 --> 02:14:43,220
Ooh.

2460
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:45,300
You must have knocked it from the tree when you fell.

2461
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:48,739
It's a little bruised, but still seems edible.

2462
02:14:48,739 --> 02:14:49,859
Uh, yeah.

2463
02:14:49,859 --> 02:14:51,649
Thank you.

2464
02:14:51,649 --> 02:14:53,890
Bomba fruit are particularly nutritious,

2465
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:56,260
and this one is in good shape despite its fall.

2466
02:14:56,260 --> 02:14:57,539
Pick it up and put it in your pack.

2467
02:14:57,539 --> 02:14:59,989
You are beginning to feel hungry.

2468
02:14:59,989 --> 02:15:03,460
I'm just gonna eat it.

2469
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:12,039
Let's eat it.

2470
02:15:12,039 --> 02:15:14,520
Actually, maybe I should eat the meat first.

2471
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:15,640
Don't go bad.

2472
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:19,800
There we go.

2473
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:28,439
Fruit will go bad sooner than meat?

2474
02:15:28,439 --> 02:15:30,789
Uh, oh well.

2475
02:15:30,789 --> 02:15:33,430
You trace what might be a path and might be an old river,

2476
02:15:33,430 --> 02:15:35,829
though through the trees of the forest.

2477
02:15:35,829 --> 02:15:38,630
Slowly, the sun begins to lower in the sky.

2478
02:15:38,630 --> 02:15:40,789
The trees are alive with movement.

2479
02:15:40,789 --> 02:15:45,029
You catch a glimpse of a bright red snake through the trees.

2480
02:15:45,029 --> 02:15:47,140
It seems to be watching you.

2481
02:15:47,140 --> 02:15:51,430
Approach the snake.

2482
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:56,600
You approach the snake, but it slips away between the trees.

2483
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:02,050
A pile of boulders here is topped by a patch of curious bright yellow moss.

2484
02:16:02,050 --> 02:16:06,229
Gather the moss.

2485
02:16:06,229 --> 02:16:08,470
Intrigued, you grab a fistful of the moss.

2486
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:13,279
It is juicy and extremely pungent.

2487
02:16:13,279 --> 02:16:20,600
Smell it, taste it, stash it, toss it, bop it, twist it, smell it, taste it,

2488
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:22,920
toss it, stash it.

2489
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:24,840
Uh, what do I do?

2490
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:28,390
I think I have a memory of this.

2491
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:35,719
I feel like there's an incorrect one to do here.

2492
02:16:35,719 --> 02:16:38,770
I'm gonna, I'll taste it.

2493
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:41,969
You taste the moss with a tentative tongue.

2494
02:16:41,969 --> 02:16:46,600
The flavor is not pleasant, but it does not appear acrid.

2495
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:49,010
Perhaps it is not poisonous.

2496
02:16:49,010 --> 02:16:52,280
Smell it.

2497
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:55,430
You put your nose deep into the moss.

2498
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:56,950
Why would you go that close?

2499
02:16:56,950 --> 02:17:03,989
The scent is like lemons and strong cheese and manure all rolled together.

2500
02:17:03,989 --> 02:17:08,069
It reminds you of the smell of drinking water in curry.

2501
02:17:08,069 --> 02:17:10,020
The effect is heady.

2502
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:19,540
I'll stash it.

2503
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:20,420
I'll stash it.

2504
02:17:20,420 --> 02:17:24,360
You store the moss in your pack, but it quickly dries and crumbles to dust.

2505
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:24,920
What?

2506
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:26,260
Rewind.

2507
02:17:26,260 --> 02:17:41,540
Okay.

2508
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:43,569
Eat it.

2509
02:17:43,569 --> 02:17:47,479
Feeling bolder, you put the clump of moss into your mouth and chew.

2510
02:17:47,479 --> 02:17:50,420
Thick yellow juices run down your chin.

2511
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:53,920
Swallowing the thick clump is hard, but almost as soon as you do,

2512
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:56,799
you feel a great warmth spreading up from your stomach.

2513
02:17:56,799 --> 02:17:59,620
Whatever this moss is, it seems to be most beneficial.

2514
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:04,420
Good thing I, um, save scummed.

2515
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:13,110
Yeah, how I usually do it, I know it doesn't really matter,

2516
02:18:13,110 --> 02:18:17,590
but typically I'll give myself like three or four rewinds a stream.

2517
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:20,819
Makes it more fun.

2518
02:18:20,819 --> 02:18:22,639
Also, it is a feature of the game.

2519
02:18:22,639 --> 02:18:23,200
That's right.

2520
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:28,389
Depends how I'm feeling.

2521
02:18:28,389 --> 02:18:30,309
Things move in the canopy all around you.

2522
02:18:30,309 --> 02:18:32,229
The sun is dropping down to the west.

2523
02:18:32,229 --> 02:18:34,069
It will be night soon.

2524
02:18:34,069 --> 02:18:37,219
You emerge from the trees into a clearing by a low hill.

2525
02:18:37,219 --> 02:18:38,659
This is an exposed place.

2526
02:18:39,219 --> 02:18:41,059
You would be unwise to stay long.

2527
02:18:47,969 --> 02:18:48,930
Uh-huh.

2528
02:18:48,930 --> 02:18:54,790
You skirt around the north side of the hillock.

2529
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:57,540
There's something quite artificial about its shape.

2530
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:59,540
Its sides are almost perfectly smooth.

2531
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:03,700
Look around.

2532
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:06,180
There is definitely something strange about this hill.

2533
02:19:06,180 --> 02:19:09,920
You decide to make a full circuit to see what you can find.

2534
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,100
As you pass the southeast side of the hillock,

2535
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:16,360
you come across an incongruous wooden doorway

2536
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:19,280
set into the curvature of the hill.

2537
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:20,319
Look at the door.

2538
02:19:20,319 --> 02:19:23,750
You step over to the doorway to examine it more closely.

2539
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:31,399
Wouldn't you like to know what's in there?

2540
02:19:31,399 --> 02:19:35,590
Wouldn't you be intrigued to know what could be inside of this?

2541
02:19:35,590 --> 02:19:37,430
What troubles do we see?

2542
02:19:39,399 --> 02:19:43,350
What difficulties do you imagine?

2543
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:58,500
Mods, put a poll up, please, into the stream voice.

2544
02:19:59,639 --> 02:20:00,840
Don't cliffhanger it.

2545
02:20:00,840 --> 02:20:03,729
I'm going to cliffhanger it.

2546
02:20:03,729 --> 02:20:06,450
I'm going to cliffhanger it because if you're interested,

2547
02:20:06,450 --> 02:20:07,329
that means you'll come back.

2548
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:14,979
The whole screen shifting?

2549
02:20:14,979 --> 02:20:15,780
Yeah, it's because I haven't.

2550
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:16,340
There we go.

2551
02:20:18,049 --> 02:20:18,770
All right, here's a poll.

2552
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:23,040
I really want to continue playing this.

2553
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:26,159
I also really want to continue playing Final Fantasy 16.

2554
02:20:31,409 --> 02:20:40,129
On Monday, would you prefer Final Fantasy 16 or Sorcery?

2555
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:47,540
Could also do both.

2556
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:49,059
That's true.

2557
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:55,200
That's actually accurate.

2558
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:56,000
Could just do both.

2559
02:20:58,549 --> 02:21:00,389
Yeah, no, don't even do a poll.

2560
02:21:00,389 --> 02:21:01,110
Not even necessary.

2561
02:21:02,930 --> 02:21:08,239
We'll play Final Fantasy 16 for a little while.

2562
02:21:08,239 --> 02:21:10,079
Maybe like same thing, like two or three hours,

2563
02:21:10,079 --> 02:21:11,920
and then come over here for two or three hours.

2564
02:21:13,379 --> 02:21:17,540
Plus, I think Sorcery also is a more chilled out experience

2565
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:18,659
where I just kind of read.

2566
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:22,129
That can happen later on in the night time.

2567
02:21:27,319 --> 02:21:29,000
Yeah, we don't have to do a poll.

2568
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:29,639
Both works.

2569
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:32,120
Two or three hours each.

2570
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:36,469
Everybody's playing Final Fantasy 16.

2571
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:40,420
Yeah, but if I don't play it on stream,

2572
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:41,860
I'm going to play it off stream.

2573
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:50,790
Yeah, we'll do both.

2574
02:21:55,989 --> 02:21:57,350
Only 5% want...

2575
02:21:57,350 --> 02:21:58,950
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2576
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:06,159
I feel like all the people that are here want Sorcery.

2577
02:22:06,159 --> 02:22:08,559
All the people that would want Final Fantasy 16

2578
02:22:08,559 --> 02:22:10,399
are probably not here right now.

2579
02:22:10,399 --> 02:22:19,479
But, you know, I love this game.

2580
02:22:20,559 --> 02:22:24,399
Sorry, it took me 295 days to come back to play it,

2581
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:26,000
but we're going to continue it on Monday.

2582
02:22:26,559 --> 02:22:39,079
So what do you guys think?

2583
02:22:39,079 --> 02:22:41,540
I know you got kind of dropped right in the middle of that,

2584
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:45,430
but what do you guys think?

2585
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,280
That was your first experience seeing it?

2586
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:53,860
I think it's cool.

2587
02:22:56,229 --> 02:22:58,229
I will tell you that I'm a little sad

2588
02:22:58,229 --> 02:23:02,690
that you're involved in the third game.

2589
02:23:03,409 --> 02:23:08,370
Because I think the second game is, like, in top...

2590
02:23:09,809 --> 02:23:12,370
It's the best one, without a doubt.

2591
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:15,430
But if you like the characters,

2592
02:23:15,430 --> 02:23:16,629
which the characters are all really cool,

2593
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:20,549
the third game just kind of keeps expanding on places to go.

2594
02:23:21,510 --> 02:23:23,350
I think there's more to see in the third game,

2595
02:23:24,069 --> 02:23:25,750
but the second game I think has a lot more...

2596
02:23:25,750 --> 02:23:26,950
I like the second game the most.

2597
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:29,969
I still very much enjoy them.

2598
02:23:29,969 --> 02:23:32,850
Third is probably up there, close to number two.

2599
02:23:33,489 --> 02:23:38,260
Yeah, we'll see you Monday.

2600
02:23:39,670 --> 02:23:41,350
Have a great rest of your weekend.

2601
02:23:41,350 --> 02:23:44,040
There's not much left of it, but enjoy it.

2602
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:47,379
I'll be here Monday around four,

2603
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:51,729
and then somewhere around, like, six to seven.

2604
02:23:51,729 --> 02:23:52,930
Maybe, like, around six-ish.

2605
02:23:53,729 --> 02:23:55,489
We'll do some chill sorcery vibes.

2606
02:23:56,209 --> 02:24:01,940
You actually like the second game more,

2607
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:03,299
or do you just get burnt out by...

2608
02:24:03,299 --> 02:24:05,059
No, I don't get burnt out from this game.

2609
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:10,770
Part two is genuinely the best out of all of them, without a doubt.

2610
02:24:10,770 --> 02:24:11,489
Kari is just...

2611
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:14,209
There's so much going on in Kari.

2612
02:24:20,209 --> 02:24:22,850
So we'll start for Final Fantasy XVI,

2613
02:24:23,809 --> 02:24:25,969
and then we'll move to sorcery around, like, six or seven.

2614
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:28,360
For chill sorcery vibes.

2615
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:30,899
Have a great night.

2616
02:24:30,899 --> 02:24:31,620
See you later.

2617
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:32,340
See you in a couple days.

2618
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:36,129
Have a great one.

2619
02:24:37,780 --> 02:24:38,340
Call your mother.

2620
02:24:38,979 --> 02:24:45,159
Eat a couple green vegetables today, you know.

2621
02:24:46,870 --> 02:24:49,350
Substitute out the bacon for, you know, some greens.

2622
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:49,909
Just today.

2623
02:24:49,909 --> 02:24:51,350
You know, once or twice a week.

2624
02:24:51,909 --> 02:24:56,280
Have a glass of water if you haven't had one.

2625
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:59,190
Get some sleep.

2626
02:25:06,690 --> 02:25:12,370
You know, I'm eating bacon right now.

2627
02:25:13,010 --> 02:25:16,739
Why would I eat vegetables right now?

2628
02:25:16,739 --> 02:25:17,700
It's like 1 a.m.

2629
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:18,739
It's midnight here.

2630
02:25:18,739 --> 02:25:19,540
It's 1 a.m.

2631
02:25:23,479 --> 02:25:24,920
It's really windy where you are.

2632
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:25,399
Yeah, it is.

2633
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:27,860
All right, take care, guys.

2634
02:25:27,860 --> 02:25:28,899
See you soon.

2635
02:25:28,899 --> 02:25:31,079
Have a good rest of your night.
