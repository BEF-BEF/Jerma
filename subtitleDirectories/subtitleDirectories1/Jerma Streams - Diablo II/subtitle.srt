00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,559
Hello. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Hope you're having a good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:22,179
I'm having a pretty good afternoon. Show yourself. Nah. Nah. He's early?

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,399
Well, the schedule changed a little bit today. It's gonna be during like 4 or 5 p.m. Pacific.

4
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:40,390
Change of plans, as you see. Apparently Joel is having PC problems. He got some new audio

5
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,869
equipment and he's walking up on them. So he's like, I'm just gonna troubleshoot it and I'm like,

6
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:58,179
go for it. Computers suck. Oh, I understand. PC gaming. When you set up your setup, he hates OBS.

7
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:08,540
What was he using before? Xsplit or something? Here comes the substitute teacher's voice.

8
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,260
Good morning, welcome class. I'm your substitute teacher. Today we're gonna learn how to do math

9
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:24,730
problems. Okay, thank you. All right, so what we're gonna do instead is something I've wanted

10
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:34,599
to do for a while and it should be interesting. Interesting as in it could go very, very, very

11
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:43,459
poorly very quickly or I'm gonna beat the whole damn game. I'm gonna play Diablo 2, straight up

12
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:53,560
Vanilla Diablo 2. Hardcore and you guys decide every single thing. You pick class, you pick the

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:02,540
stat points and you pick the skill points. So you're already dead. You are already dead. Yes.

14
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:14,759
Something like that. Oh, that's a terrible idea. I actually was freaking out about this because

15
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,039
I brought this up to be like a month or two ago and somebody in the chat said, dude, you're gonna

16
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:29,479
die to corpse fire. And I'm like, don't fucking say that. Don't say that because I might and it's

17
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,849
if you know, you know. When corpse fire dies, it's like eight minutes into the game. There is a

18
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:43,770
chance that the computer will hang for three seconds and he's going to explode and you'll die.

19
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:55,960
It happens. I have to be very careful but I'm going to leave most decisions up to you. Now

20
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:04,469
you will not have the decision of choosing weapons and items because if you give me a complete and

21
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:11,349
total dickhead build and make me use a club as a source verse or something like I'm I mean,

22
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,469
I'm going to pick the items. I'm not just going to be naked and shit like this is not going to happen

23
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:23,270
but it should be fun. I also found out something interesting today that I didn't know because why

24
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:32,840
would I know this? My Diablo II account is banned from Battle.net for some particular reason. I don't

25
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:48,060
know why. I can't. I'm apparently been shadow banned. I didn't do anything. I don't know when

26
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:57,110
this happened. I haven't played Diablo II in at least a couple of years but apparently I did

27
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:07,770
something wrong. I'm not sure what it was and here's the worst part about that. Diablo II is

28
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:18,220
in a funny position right now on Battle.net where I can't buy another copy. I can't. To get a new

29
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:32,649
CD key I can't purchase another copy. Maybe it was a mod? I don't know. I can buy a copy for a friend

30
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:40,339
so I'm gonna have to eventually if I want to play online buy a copy for a friend send it to

31
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:53,529
their email and then tell them to give me the CD key. What? Why would you buy again?

32
00:04:54,709 --> 00:05:00,230
Well what am I supposed to do? Call Blizzard support? Hey uh I don't know what happened like

33
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:07,029
four years ago. I have no idea but I think I've been shadow banned on Diablo II. What are they

34
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:21,750
gonna do? They don't give a shit about Diablo II anymore. You know I would assume if they could

35
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:34,870
just delete Diablo II off the store they would. I'm not gonna call Blizzard. But anyways so I was

36
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,629
under the assumption that I might be able to get a little help if I needed it. No I have to do this

37
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:51,899
alone for the best maybe. I was thinking maybe oh fuck this is gonna be impossible for me to do this

38
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,699
alone. Hey I know some of you guys have D2 get on like just kill kill on Dario for me whatever

39
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:09,529
it's for the stream. I can't do that now I have to do it all myself. Without further ado we are

40
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:15,449
we are gonna get started. Please do me a quick favor. I need to make sure that you guys can

41
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:30,980
click on the screen. So uh oh just realized something very important. It'll be tricky it's

42
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:38,180
gonna take a little finagling. I just realized that I can't can't can't. All right how do you

43
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,579
in Windows 10 how do you pin a window to not be minimized? Anybody know is there like a shortcut?

44
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,339
Because every time I click off the screen the window drops. Is there a way to just pin a window

45
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:58,980
so it never uh never it gets minimized? You have to do it in the task manager? All I have is close

46
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:09,509
window. Oh that's complicated. Is it? Make it windowed? It is windowed but I it's I have

47
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,220
it doesn't matter every time I minimize the window. You know every time I minimize the

48
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,180
window then no no no look I'll just show you in real time. I'll just show you in real time.

49
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:32,060
So for instance here is Diablo 2 right? But here's my cursor if I click off the window at all

50
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,790
bye bye here's my desktop. How do I do that? How do I keep that there? How do I keep it from doing

51
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:46,579
that? How do I keep it there? Pretty sick background I know. But to turn on click map

52
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:52,040
so I have to click out of the window. You know what I'm saying? There's got to be a way. What is

53
00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:03,029
this background? All right we're not ready yet hold on. The boomer wallpaper? No it's a default

54
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:09,750
basic wallpaper sorry. All right where is it? I have to download a program? Do I have to download

55
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,750
more programs for this? I think it'll be fine. I just have to like make the window maximized again

56
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,430
when I turn on click maps. So anytime click maps turns on just wait like five seconds before you

57
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:34,299
click anything. I know that's asking a lot. It's an 800 by 600 boomer wallpaper. This isn't a joke

58
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:40,700
background. Do you know how hard it is to find? I got three monitors and it's hard it's kind of

59
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,019
hard to find one that doesn't hurt my eyes because you get it you get attacked from all angles.

60
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,740
Three just three monitors only three omega low. Only what do you mean only three? That's a ton.

61
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:03,620
Like I'm under attack from my right screen because it's just there. What do I need? Who needs more

62
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,330
than three monitors? What do you need it for? I'm not like watching tv on something. Maybe I mean

63
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,559
that'd be kind of fun actually. All right we're gonna test see if this works. Let me just see

64
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,440
what happens. Here is Diablo 2. Remember what happens if I die in hardcore? I die when you die

65
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:33,340
when you die you're dead. There it is. Okay so let me make sure the click maps works.

66
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:41,179
Otherwise that would be bad wouldn't it? Yeah you're gonna get the mountains every

67
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:45,019
every like every time there's a decision that needs to be made you're gonna get these beautiful

68
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:52,629
mountains. All right does click maps actually even work? It does. Well this is just a test.

69
00:09:53,269 --> 00:10:07,429
Any people clicking? It's me on the right. Look at that it's pretty good actually.

70
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:15,399
You have scuffed maps. Well the reason why I have scuffed maps is because it's actually easier to

71
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,549
the bubbles to not run into each other. All right but this is not the this is not the choice. This

72
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:32,870
is just us hanging out for a second. Fire I want you to be fire be fire. Just so you guys know

73
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:39,019
I really am actually looking to you to not ruin this whole thing and I know you give I'm giving

74
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:45,179
this to thousands of people. So this is not this is not it. Hold on take a look at those mountains

75
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:55,740
for a second. This is and fine if you want to have a 200 strength source for that has a melee

76
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:03,820
for a move. I mean I'll try to work with it but just know if I kill the last boss with this shitty

77
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:10,549
character I think that I think I deserve something there. I think I deserve at least a little bit of

78
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:18,340
credit. Don't do melee it's shit. Well all right this is not up to me. Are you ready to pick the

79
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,700
class? Here we go. Pick the class. I'll go over them just in case people don't know. I mean Diablo

80
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:32,259
it's been a while. Diablo II is an old fucking game. Amazon. Bows. Spears. Ranged mostly. Javelins.

81
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:40,419
Assassin. Traps. Bombs. Martial arts. Mostly melee with a little bit of electricity involved.

82
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:46,820
Necromancer. The meme character. Diablo II if you don't know has this thing where you can have like

83
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,820
a hundred companions on the screen. This is the summoner. You can have like

84
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:58,840
85 fucking people running around with you. Okay cool. It kind of sucks though. So just let you know.

85
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,549
Barbarian. Melee. Very easy. Or you could put 20 points into potion. Potion find.

86
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:10,070
And that'll be completely useless. That sounds fun. Melee. Paladin.

87
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,740
That's all you need to know. That's all. That's literally it. Sorceress.

88
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:28,440
Magic. Casting. Bells. Fire. Lightning. Ice. And druid. Summoning. A little bit of summoning.

89
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,990
Also shapeshifting. Bears. Turning into a wolf. You guys know? You guys get your ideas? This is it.

90
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:43,580
Majority rules here. Whoever has the most percentage. And by the way if you click,

91
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:50,419
if you click on fire or exit your vote is useless. We're not doing it again. Don't start yet. I'll

92
00:12:50,419 --> 00:13:00,470
tell you when. Look at those mountains. These mountains are fucking beautiful. Here we go.

93
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:32,899
I don't know. Use window capture? That doesn't work. Okay. That seems like a lot of people

94
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:42,629
want to do Necromancer. You're on an old version of Diablo. I'm on 1.14d and I have the glide

95
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,950
wrapper installed. I shouldn't be doing this but it is. And there's not much I can do about it

96
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:59,350
at the moment. All right. Looks like we're doing Necromancer. Which I'll work with it.

97
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:10,549
Wait. Why do you guys want to do this? You really want to do this? This is going to be so,

98
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,870
this is going to be the most boring playthrough ever. I'm not going to. All right. This is also

99
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,470
important. No. We're doing another vote. We're doing. No. No. Are we? I don't. Okay. Listen.

100
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:25,590
Listen. Listen. Important. I won't. I can't kill bosses. I know what you're going to do.

101
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,070
I know exactly. I know what you guys are going to do. I can't kill bosses.

102
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:35,379
It's literally this will be unbeatable. I'm going to have to hit the bosses with like a wand.

103
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:43,610
Or a stick. Like six or seven hundred times. And run back into a portal. All right. Fine. Fine.

104
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:54,070
Fine. Fine. God damn it. Fine. All right. Let's go. Veto it. Veto it. I can't. Why did I say that

105
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:59,029
in the beginning? By the way, this is the worst thing you could do. Actually it's not. So you

106
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:06,980
just got baited. Congratulations guys. Yep. Let's go. Check out those mountains for a sec.

107
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,879
Okay. Barbarian actually would be the worst thing in the world if you did Barbarian potion

108
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,759
finding. I literally don't want to have moves. Or a melee sorceress with like eight hundred

109
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:34,940
strength. Completely worthless. I can work with this. Maybe I should pick the stats because

110
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:42,710
otherwise this is going to be fucking impossible. No. Not Sans. Of course somebody's going to say

111
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:50,600
Sans. Unbelievable. I am actually fucking mad about that. I am actually upset about this. Tommy

112
00:15:50,600 --> 00:16:08,889
Pickles? How about Tommy Pickles? Makes no sense. Tommy Pickles does not make any sense.

113
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:31,450
Chucky? Chucky the Necromancer? Okay. I like that. Here we go. Diablo II hardcore

114
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:38,840
as a Necromancer. Good luck. No. Too late. It's a bad name. It's too late. You guys. This guy's

115
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:54,460
going to last five minutes. It's a bad name. And okay. Chucky's a bad name but Sans is a good name.

116
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:20,039
Tommy Lee Bones. Sans. Tommy Lee Bones. That's very elaborate. I like Tommy Lee Bones.

117
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:30,500
And it fits. Tommy Lee Bones. Warning. Once a hardcore character dies it cannot be played

118
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,220
again. Are you sure you wish to make a hardcore character? Yes. Here we go. Good day. You guys

119
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:45,829
hear it? Greetings stranger. I'm not surprised to see your kind here. Many adventurers have traveled

120
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:50,980
this way since the recent troubles began. No doubt you've heard about the tragedy that

121
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,420
befell the town of Tristram. Just look at these mountains for a second. Some say the Diablo

122
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:04,549
walks the world again. I don't know if I believe that but I did travel this route a few weeks ago.

123
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:10,630
It was headed east to the mountain pass guarded by the rogue monastery. Maybe it's nothing but

124
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,470
evil seems to have trailed in his wake. I didn't skip anything. You'll see shortly after the

125
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,670
wanderer went through. As everybody knows the fucking story, do we really have to do this?

126
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:24,069
And strange creatures began ravaging the countryside. Until it's safer outside the

127
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:29,019
camp and the gates are reopened, I'll remain here with my caravan. I hope to leave for Loot

128
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:35,420
Ghulain before the shadow that fell over Tristram consumes us all. If you're still alive then I'll

129
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:41,819
take you along. Mute the game audio. You've never played Diablo 2 ever? Holy shit. You're in for a

130
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:52,170
tramy. She can tell you more. Okay so I'm a necromancer. We don't need the help on there.

131
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:57,930
I already know how to play the game. Right now as you can see I've got my inventory. I've got a wand

132
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,170
which is plus one to raise skeletons so I can have a skeleton. None of this matters. I'm dead in

133
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,569
fucking five minutes. Like this I'm gonna lose. No I get rid of the wand. What do you mean get rid

134
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:16,779
of the fucking wand? What are you talking about? Why would I get rid of the wand? See this is why

135
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:22,059
I'm so glad I have you have nothing to do with the items I can equip. Here's your stash. I'm so I

136
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:30,250
can't wait. I love this game so much. Just like you played D3. Drop wand. I know I can't. I do

137
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,779
have to do this though. So you uh reanimate a skeletal warrior from a target corpse. If something

138
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:40,700
dies you can bring it back to life as a skeleton. Right now I have one total skeleton. It'll have

139
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:52,019
20 health. 2020. One to two damage. Drop the wand. Chat picks everything. To an extent though.

140
00:19:52,019 --> 00:20:02,579
No I'm not dropping the fucking wand. I'm not dropping the wand. I can't summon. I can't.

141
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,940
What are you talking about? You can't punch things. The necromancer and the level one.

142
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,619
Cain's title. No that's true.

143
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:24,500
Drop it. I'm not dropping. I'm not dropping the wand. You're not going to convince me.

144
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,779
No this is hardcore man. I don't want to die to corpse pyre. If I die to corpse pyre then I'm

145
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:34,819
not going to stream for a week. Like I'll just turn the stream off. I'll get out of here. No way.

146
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:35,779
Like that's too embarrassing.

147
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:50,259
I implore you stranger please help us find a way to lift this terrible curse on this town.

148
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,539
There is a place of great evil. There is a place of great evil in the wilderness.

149
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:03,220
Kasha's rogue scouts have informed me that a cave nearby is filled with shadowy creatures

150
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,779
and horrors from beyond the grave. Predicted it. Yeah I've only done what you're seeing right now.

151
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:11,700
Probably realistically five to six hundred times.

152
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:19,220
If you are sincere about helping us you can find the dark labyrinth and destroy the foul beasts.

153
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,299
Be the great eye watch over you. All right so Diablo 2 works like this. You get six quests in

154
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:32,660
each zone. There are one two three four five zones. That's six no just five. He doesn't even know his

155
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,259
own game. So the six quests in every zone. This is the first one. Look for the den in the wilderness

156
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:39,220
outside the rogue's camp. We're going to change a couple things just to make sure

157
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,059
because I don't like that. I don't like that at all. We're going to go into the options. We're

158
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,900
going to go into the mini map controls. We're doing the small map. I'm going to fade everything.

159
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,369
So then we just keep it on the screen there in the top left. Now we got a mini map.

160
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,769
You click to move in this game which is interesting. Click to move in this game.

161
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:07,930
All right let's go. Let us pick the options. Options. We're going to find the den of evil

162
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:18,059
guys. Are you ready? Beware. I'm so ready. Pre-recorded stream. That would be funny.

163
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,420
Go get a stone of Jordan. Just wait till you see the drops in this game.

164
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,700
I'm so nervous. I can't like walk around. So I got posters down here obviously. You click on

165
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:37,099
things to attack. We got one skeleton. This held us up there. Actually I actually don't mind this.

166
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:52,250
Hold alt to see everything. Turn the game down. Is it loud now? How's that? Better? Is that a

167
00:22:52,250 --> 00:23:00,539
little more bearable? All right looking for the bloodmore. Now we're in the bloodmore.

168
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:18,539
Your video buffered. We're talking about buffered. It's Goldilocks too much. The game works just like

169
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:24,619
I don't know why. Why do I feel like I need to describe Diablo to you guys? It's every single

170
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:38,059
human. Even those that don't play video games know this game. Every human. I literally don't.

171
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,220
Do I need to explain Diablo too? Do I? All right here we go. You guys are going to have some

172
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,869
choices here and you're gonna have to pick. That's the ultimate rumor. That's an air rumor.

173
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:58,309
That's a fucking that's flying like over the house. That's okay. We're good. The way that

174
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,829
skills work in Diablo is every time you level up you get a skill point. Each one of these can have

175
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:10,710
up to 20 points each. Summoning spells. Poison and bone. Curses. As you can see. You have a lot of

176
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:20,019
choices. Each one of these can hold 20 points. If I were you. If I was watching this stream right

177
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:29,420
now I would go open up a Diablo 2 skill calculator. Find out what you'd like to pick. You can't you

178
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,900
know you can't choose. If you guys choose nothing. If all of you guys click on like the the X.

179
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:49,190
Then I get to choose. Run on 3D audio. I can't turn that. That feature like doesn't exist anymore.

180
00:24:50,230 --> 00:25:01,460
All right I need some items. We're gonna find the little cave. We're looking for a little cave.

181
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,059
It's a little and by the way I'm gonna level up soon. You guys will have an opportunity to fucking

182
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:15,210
me. It's all right. Imagine min maxing every playthrough lol. Yeah it's Diablo man. You gotta

183
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:21,720
be careful. He's listening to the he's listening to this in 2D.

184
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:33,660
I can't fucking believe this is not gonna work. You know how many times I've tried

185
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,900
to do okay you can only play as a summoning necromancer if you have like four friends to carry

186
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:50,230
you. Oh shit. Look at that. You wanna see? Show all items. Show all items. All right look.

187
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,900
Low quality leather armor. That's a fucking pogchamp right there. I've never seen one.

188
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,789
There's your belt. Your belt can only hold four potions at the moment.

189
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:04,970
And these potions are not instant. You have to eventually end up spamming these.

190
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:15,500
This is the first ding. All right guys. Let me get to. Here's the thing. I can't just like stand still

191
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,740
because this is hardcore. I'll die. Just wait a minute. We'll do this. Give me a second. All

192
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:34,140
right. Is this safe? Is it safe? I think. Okay. We'll do the skill point first. So the first thing

193
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:41,529
you need to do is you have to pick a category. So it's gonna be category first. Okay. Once you

194
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:48,359
pick that category don't select anything. You're picking a category first. Is this uh yeah this is

195
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:55,019
LOD. Don't touch anything. I'm gonna show you the focus of mountains for a second. Okay please

196
00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:16,950
choose a category. Right. I click this one. I choose skeleton. I like skeleton. He looks cool.

197
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:25,990
All right. Point number one is gonna go into summoning spells. It just is. It's too much.

198
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:32,859
All right. I'm gonna show you a cool fucking mountain for a second. Okay. Where do you want

199
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:44,809
me to put the point? There's only one place it can go. You can only put it. There's only one place

200
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:53,180
it can go. I can't touch this yet. Gee. I fucking wonder where it's gonna go guys.

201
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:13,180
Well. Okay. I wanted to raise skeleton. Now I got two. Pretty cool. All right. Now.

202
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:19,819
Dude. I gotta figure out how to keep this fucking thing. All right. The stat points thing. This is

203
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:37,180
gonna be hard because this is so important. Like it's so important. If there's somebody watching

204
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,859
right now that's played this game and I know this is probably up high in the categories on Twitch

205
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:46,140
right now. You're about to see something that's gonna make you fucking just curl up into your

206
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:52,630
chair and I know and I can't fix it. Nothing I can do about it. By the way this is for all five

207
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:58,359
points. We're not gonna sit here and do each individual point. One at a time. This stream

208
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:04,759
isn't gonna be all day. The stream is never gonna turn off. Every single point has to be voted on

209
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:18,200
but what about the mountains? All right. This is for two at a time. Two at a time. Two points at

210
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:31,660
a time. Where's it going? I'm not even sure it's it's far away enough. Make sure you're clicking on

211
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:39,799
the right spot. Thank you. It might be too far away. I might just have to. I might have to decide

212
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:49,430
these. I might have to decide these is too. Wait. Hold on. Mountain. Wait. Zoom it in. I got no.

213
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:56,150
Hold on. I gotta like. Zooming in this guy. Look at those mountains. Hold on. I can't zoom in. I

214
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:03,480
can't zoom in this. I can't. All five. This is for all five points. Do not do an

215
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:10,789
individual mountain voting. No. Just okay. I'm gonna take a screenshot and I'm gonna zoom the

216
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:21,299
fuck in. That's a good idea. All right. Screenshot. Print screen. I didn't think this one. All right.

217
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:30,789
I got a print screen. Take a look at those mountains. All right. Hold on. Give me one second.

218
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,990
Give me one second. Give me give me give me one second. So this will be this will be much easier.

219
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:43,859
In fact, yeah, this is going to be so much easier. It becomes the longest stream of 2020 or the

220
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:53,349
shortest one. I'm not sure yet. We'll find out eventually. Okay. Hold on one sec.

221
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:09,059
Hey, you guys will be able to see them both. That. Okay. I just wish I could keep the window up. I

222
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:15,160
don't know why it's doing that. I have it in windowed mode. I cannot play this game online.

223
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:29,930
My account is banned for no I for no reason. I didn't fucking do anything. All right. Let's save

224
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:41,799
this. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. All right. Here we go. So now I can just do this. This would be much

225
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:46,519
easier. Do I do this for each individual skill tree too? So we could just go bang bang. I got a

226
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,000
good idea. Hold on. Okay. I got a good idea. This is gonna be a good idea. No, don't do that.

227
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,740
No, that's a good idea. I mean, this is the fucking window. Shit's gonna be all over the place.

228
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,539
All right. Just get, you know, here like the stream hadn't even started yet. Just fucking hold

229
00:31:58,539 --> 00:33:56,599
on. I'll be right back. All right. I believe I'm ready to start doing this. Okay. For a second,

230
00:33:56,599 --> 00:34:01,460
I just had a panic attack because I realized that this is this has been minimized the whole

231
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:11,340
fucking time and I I've just been like I could be dead right now. Okay. Hold on. That just like

232
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:18,019
scared the shit out of me. All right. Let me just get these loaded up. All right. Just hold on a

233
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:22,340
second. The stream's starting to just a minute. Pick which way you want five points to go. Go for

234
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:50,969
it. Nice JPGE. Yeah, I know. I know. Trust me. Strength. Okay. Of course. We did it. Hooray.

235
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:57,849
This will, once we work the kinks out, this is gonna be a lot of fun. Well, good for you guys,

236
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:10,039
I guess. All right. Okay. Five points in strength. Pay no attention to these.

237
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:23,559
I'm just getting them ready. Don't click on any of these yet. Don't pay any attention to these.

238
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:35,429
These are just putting my my getting my pages ready. Mountains? No, we're gonna we're trying

239
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:58,420
to minimize the amount of mountains we have to have. Put that on there. I know it's gonna be all

240
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:29,579
stretched out, but you have to just it's gonna be easier for you to click. Sounds good. Everything

241
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:38,789
should be good to go, right? Now, very important. Okay. Sorry, guys. I didn't realize this is gonna

242
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:47,690
be as much as a pain in the ass as this actually is. All because I can't fucking get off my

243
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:59,530
minimization. Don't get mad. I'm good. This is called this is this is poison and bone.

244
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:20,539
Which one is this one? This is versus. Okay. What the fuck is this one? I promise we'll actually

245
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:30,860
do something in a minute. Blame Blizzard for literally not giving a shit about the games

246
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:38,550
they made 15 years ago, unless they can resell them for $40. Oh, hey, we had some community

247
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:47,300
subs. We had 20 community subs from Zap X. Z half X. And hold on. Wait, hold on. A bunch of money

248
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:57,429
came in. Thanks for the 20 subs. Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars from AB Joe. Give me one moment.

249
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:03,380
Well, I gotta get this stuff going. Kind of against the clock here trying to get this to work.

250
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:14,440
All right. Now I just have to add it to the stream deck. Okay. This is it. We're just like,

251
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:23,659
just look at the screen for a minute. Blizzard. Fuck your old games unless you can 15 years later

252
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:46,860
sell them for $50. I'm gonna call this one bone right now. I wonder how many sad people buy because

253
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:54,360
they sell it on on battle.net. They sell this shit on battle.net. I wonder how many disappointed

254
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,519
people go to buy this and then go, wow, this is fucking like not even remotely close to being what

255
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:09,980
it should be in 2020. All right. There's the bone. This is all for a purpose. Trust me. I promise.

256
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:33,130
It's a curse. Uh huh. Last one. I promise. Summon. Here we go. Imagine there having to be third

257
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:39,820
party mods to have the game run in a fucking window correctly. Blizzard entertainment.

258
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:52,139
Tis ain't the same, is it? And summon. All right. Here we go. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm actually ready

259
00:39:52,139 --> 00:40:14,219
to fucking do this. If I'm dead, I'm gonna fucking be so bad. All right. We finally crossed the

260
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:20,860
threshold where I can do this. Sorry for the 500 people that left. Blame Blizzard. Always.

261
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:51,079
Here we go. I'll be shocked if I get past fucking Act 1. How have I not found the Den of Evil yet?

262
00:40:55,219 --> 00:41:11,480
I'm gonna blame the dumb idiot streamer. You could. You could, but don't. Holy shit. Everyone

263
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:22,789
came back. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What? Hold on. Like 700 people left and they all just came back

264
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:31,619
instantly. Like they all came back at the same time. They were all just like, all right,

265
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:39,820
I'll come back in like 20 minutes. I'll get this shit figured out. Hey, what's going on guys?

266
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:45,579
Not a big deal. Don't worry. Everything's good to go. We are. I got two skeletons.

267
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:52,460
I'm gonna have to use a sword. Where's the Den of Evil? It never takes me this long. I've played

268
00:41:52,460 --> 00:42:11,429
this game 2,000 times. Where's the Den of Evil? Wait, do I have a stamina? I'm already, I already

269
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:16,550
had a stamina. I didn't lose already. Your health has to go to zero to lose. Give me vitality next

270
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:40,329
time, please guys. For the love of God. No. Use the bow. I don't have any arrows. This is the

271
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:44,489
longest I think it's ever. This is the type of RNG you get where if I was speed running this game,

272
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:55,989
I would just smash my fingers on the desk and then quit. What is it? A car door? Yeah,

273
00:42:55,989 --> 00:43:12,070
I smashed my fingers at my car door on my desk. Ah, there it is. Help. Damn it. Why aren't you

274
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:20,570
saying it? Help. Help me. Help me. Help. Help. Help me. Got it. All right. We have to kill every

275
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,050
single monster in Den of Evil. Oh God. No, I died. Within this place. That's good.

276
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:41,369
I think I got my two skeletons there. I got a dagger. Field? No, pet build would be.

277
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,849
I can't believe we're actually doing this. This is actually bullshit. This is gonna be so bad.

278
00:43:47,610 --> 00:44:00,260
All right. Hold on. What did I get? Ooh, two sockets. Yeah. Yeah. One to three. Good for. No.

279
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,739
You're a summoner in hardcore by myself.

280
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:12,139
This early in the game, I mean, you get carried as a summoner to late game.

281
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:19,260
I'm not gonna be able to beat the first one. I'm actually kind of glad you guys are doing the

282
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,659
main and putting points into strength because I'm gonna have to hit the fucking first possible

283
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:34,539
wouldn't stick until the end. All right. Do I have any? I'm actually paranoid.

284
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:42,900
It's so loud too. Why is this so loud? Come on.

285
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:56,869
Amulet. I just let you guys know the way it's white is the lowest quality. Actually,

286
00:44:56,869 --> 00:45:04,309
gray could be technically damaged. Blue is magic to standard. Yellow is rare. And then gold is

287
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:10,059
unique. Not legendary. You could call it legendary if you want. I know we leveled up. Just hold on.

288
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:15,500
We know how Diablo work, but I do you. I got like 10 people that's fucking 5,000 people here.

289
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,300
Yeah. Look it up. Just look up Diablo 2 rules and there's like a whole list. You can read them.

290
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:31,130
Be careful. There's a little mini boss in here. I got to heal.

291
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:45,449
Diablo 2 rules. It's great. Yeah. All right. You got to kill. Where's the shaman?

292
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:53,110
And you have to identify shit in this game. Actually, let's identify this. Hey,

293
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,949
plus two to strength. That's you guys are doing that already. Might as well just keep it going.

294
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:13,369
Is there even any skills that the necromancer has? Two to seven. I lose a skeleton though.

295
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:21,750
No, not worth it. I'm too scared to lose another skeleton. All right. Time to level up. So

296
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:30,900
here we go. Where are we going? Actually, I'm going to do it like this.

297
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:41,989
So you guys don't have to end up. You guys never have to see the mountains again.

298
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:48,809
I don't want you guys have to see the mountains again. All right. What are we doing?

299
00:46:49,940 --> 00:47:04,500
That's first. Thank God. The mountains are the best bit of a stream. No, I don't. That's like

300
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,699
jarring. Are we actually going to put points into vitality for the love of God?

301
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:22,329
Thank you. Seriously. Thank you. You're not going to regret this. All right. Thank you. No energy.

302
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:30,500
Well, that's not that important right now. Very cool. Thanks guys. Back to it. Here we go.

303
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:44,090
So, um, yes, good work. All right. Now for the skill, the skill point where what, first of all,

304
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:55,530
you got to, maybe you got to pick a category. So why is this all fucked up? Hold on a second.

305
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:05,800
Should be spread across the whole thing. No, what? Lock this in place for the love of God.

306
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,980
I don't want you to see the goddamn mountains. I don't want you to see the mountains.

307
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:34,809
Okay. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. All right. I know this is real

308
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:48,630
ugly. You ready? Where are we going? Why is it doing this? Stop doing. Oh my God. I hate Blizzard.

309
00:48:49,349 --> 00:49:11,929
He said it. Oh my God. He said it. He said it in this very moment. What is happening? Why is this?

310
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:17,050
What do you, am I going crazy? Okay. Am I going crazy? Why does this keep doing this?

311
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:42,389
Okay. Fucking Blizzard entertainment. Can you believe it? Where are we going? Why can I not

312
00:49:42,389 --> 00:49:56,380
see this? I didn't spend the point. All right. We're going summoning. Good. Now where? Now what

313
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:08,090
do you want me to do? It only took an hour. And then for me to say that I hate Blizzard for this

314
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:21,670
to work. We can only go, all right. We can't even go anywhere for this. I can show you what these

315
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:33,719
things do if you want. All right. Three skeletons. Let's go.

316
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:11,800
Skeleton squad moving on. How many, how many more we have?

317
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:28,659
Funny. Am I allowed to click on shrines? Yes. All right. So at three points,

318
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,940
he's still the same amount of health. Better attack and defense. So that's good.

319
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:47,530
I feel like we're going to walk into a fire and I should hopefully get some good items.

320
00:51:50,119 --> 00:52:03,610
Players at eight. Players at eight. Did I do that? Players, how about players?

321
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:12,300
No, that's, I'm going to die. That's like the quickest way for me to get destroyed. Four.

322
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:17,429
That's cheating. That's reverse cheating. That's seven times the difficulty.

323
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:21,590
You're going to get more experience. All right. No, no. All right. We'll do four.

324
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:34,860
Players set to four. That's more experience. What if I die though? All right. I might,

325
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:40,940
I might revert this. I'm kind of scared about this. How many, what if I, how many? Okay. It hurts.

326
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:52,550
It's power leveling. Lakers set to four. Yeah. It's simulating four people in the game.

327
00:52:53,429 --> 00:52:57,500
There he is. There he is. There he is. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't, don't,

328
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:05,300
don't fuck this up. You guys get in there and you, that's corpse fire. He's fucking scary.

329
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,980
He has electricity. He, he, he just fucking one hit killed that guy.

330
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:27,320
He explodes when he dies and it's going to kill me. I'm, I'm going to, it's going to kill me.

331
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,360
It's going to kill me. I'm already panicking for no reason. How much health does he have?

332
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:47,369
All right. Get him. Get him. You have the AFK build on. I, this is actually not that big of a

333
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:56,679
deal. He's going to watch this. Ready? Watch all three of these. Wait, does he not have that move?

334
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,280
Oh shit. He doesn't have that move in normal. Okay. Well, we're fine. Level up again.

335
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:10,710
There is one more monster left. What are you doing? Skeletons are you doing? You're going

336
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:29,980
off on skeletons here. Where's this last one? That's what we got a ha ha copy pasta. Oh,

337
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:49,940
well cut it out. You're a monster. They're an underrated type of, I've never seen this before.

338
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:55,369
I've got a bunch of dog shit we got to throw away. I'm going to kill one more monster. We're going

339
00:54:55,369 --> 00:55:11,699
to, we're going to get this down so I can actually, I swear to God, people only call my phone when the

340
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:18,659
stream is turned off. Nobody fucking calls me at any second of the day, unless it's, I'm live.

341
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:31,420
All right. Where's this last monster? They're trying to network with you.

342
00:55:32,139 --> 00:55:41,260
Why would you do? No, not like when I'm, not when I'm working. You stream for eight hours though.

343
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:44,940
Yeah. But I start the stream around the same time, like between like, you know, two in the

344
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:49,659
afternoon, three in the afternoon, four in the afternoon, five in the afternoon. Sometimes one

345
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:57,880
in the afternoon. You know, it's a big window. You're right. I got to find this last monster.

346
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:13,130
Where's this? Oh, wait. Get all this gold. I got fucking banned from battling that. Like I'm, I'm

347
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,250
not happy with Blizzard at the moment. I'm like actually annoyed by this.

348
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:32,579
Press completed. I didn't do anything. Greetings. You have cleansed the den of evil.

349
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:36,579
So if we're doing the den of evil, we get a skill point. You've earned my trust and may yet

350
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:42,550
restore my faith and humanity. What is training in the skill of your choice? Thank you.

351
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:48,869
All right. So, uh, again, we're, uh, we're, where would you guys like to go?

352
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:53,510
That's so ugly, but it has to be like this. I don't, I refuse to show you the mountains.

353
00:56:53,510 --> 00:57:14,090
Where we go? Okay. Summoning. We got 2000 clicks already. Show the available skill pass. Yeah,

354
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:20,579
I'll do that too. I think I know where everyone wants to go. I want to go to summoning. Very cool.

355
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:32,980
So from here, uh, I wonder what you want to do. Uh, yeah. So we're going to put it in skeleton

356
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:45,929
build. Fucking dumb ass boring chat. I didn't say that. Oh yeah. Skeletons.

357
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:51,769
It's all right. It's okay. We're going to be good. All right. We're going to put it into skeletons.

358
00:57:53,820 --> 00:58:01,340
Let's take a look at what these points actually do first. So, uh, as you can see here are the

359
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:07,929
paths. So you probably should have seen that first. Okay. Let's actually, let's go over this first.

360
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:14,309
Let's go over this first. We've opened up some stuff. All right. So you

361
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:24,550
spray listed. We're going to do it again. Ray skeleton skeleton mastery is what you can do as

362
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:30,969
well. Cause this path has gone over this way. Uh, it's a passive increases the life and damage of

363
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:40,010
Ray skeletons. So you just make them better, more better, more better at level 12. We can go down

364
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:47,380
to skeleton mage at level six. We can do clay gone more better poison and bone. What is available is

365
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:52,659
bone armor, which is just a shield of bone that absorbs and shit. It's pretty good. It absorbs 20

366
00:58:52,659 --> 00:59:00,949
damage. As you see, I have 59 health, which that's pretty great actually teeth, which I can explain

367
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:06,710
as just, it goes around, around, around, around, around, around. That's all. That's seriously what

368
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:11,909
it is. There's no other way for me to describe this. Uh, it's just a damaging spell. It shoots

369
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:20,250
little, uh, little goo balls out curses. Uh, necromancer can cast curses on people that do

370
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:25,210
various things like for instance, uh, amplify damage increases the, uh, physical damage that

371
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:31,050
they take. They take a hundred percent more damage from all physical attacks. Number 20 points can

372
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:37,289
go into all of these. The reason why I'm doing this is because you see the screenshots we have

373
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:43,110
and I have to remember, uh, we'll go over it before we do it, obviously, but for instance, curses,

374
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,230
like that's what we have available, but it's going to be grayed out, but you see the path,

375
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:54,280
right? All right. So with that knowledge and knowing what we can do, we'll do another,

376
00:59:54,280 --> 01:00:03,139
we'll do one more. Here we go. It's, it's race. It was race. Okay. Now we have another,

377
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:19,289
we have another point. Where's it going? It's not like a category. You got to pick a category for

378
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:23,929
all right. Okay. Does it count if you pick the category and then you pick the skeletons?

379
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:39,369
You're already just going to skeleton. It's already been decided. Like I can't even,

380
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:46,380
it's just going to the skeleton. It's supposed to be category first and that's just not it. All

381
01:00:46,380 --> 01:01:05,510
right. Okay. We're making a huge minus two joke. I'm not me. Uh, by the way, we still only have

382
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:43,289
four skeletons, three skeletons, six stats, five points. Why am I so boring? What? Whatever.

383
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:51,929
Whatever you say. All right. We're going vitality. Thanks for vitality. Appreciate it.

384
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:09,960
Thanks for the vitality. Stupid chat. It's stupid over what the stats do. I will.

385
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:21,159
That's not a bad idea. Strength is just melee damage and able to wear heavy armor. You can wear

386
01:02:21,159 --> 01:02:27,099
heavier shit. Dexterity is attack rating, which is how often you will hit something and your

387
01:02:27,099 --> 01:02:33,960
defense rating. So, I mean, kind of useless for a necromancer. Vitality is health and stamina.

388
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,559
Stamina becomes absolutely useless. It doesn't matter anymore after like 50 points

389
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:56,219
and energy is mana. So this is health and mana. Kill NPCs. Stop going around like slashing.

390
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:09,989
All right. Let's keep going. I need to do this. Let's sell some stuff. Kill NPCs. All right. I

391
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:15,030
got to let's identify this brain. It's pretty pogchamp right there. Pretty cool. I can't use

392
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:22,949
this. This is a sorceress only. I need to get a book too. What do I have? 90? Oh, I'm not going

393
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:38,179
to use a bow. I got to, I have to identify, I got to identify this shit. You can reset your skills

394
01:03:38,179 --> 01:03:45,320
once per difficulty, right? Is that correct? I don't have enough. Was it 360? What?

395
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:58,820
What? 350 or 360? 360. I want to identify this because it'll be worth more.

396
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:06,099
How the fuck do I not have to bring your 60? All right. There we go. Now I can sell this for 840.

397
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:11,780
You have to identify every single magic item. Now we got money. Town portal scrolls. This book allows

398
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:16,710
you to travel back and forth from town. It's pretty useful. It's pretty good shit. Don't get

399
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:23,210
the identified book. Kane does it for free. Well, I needed, Kane's not here yet. Not in town.

400
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:39,590
I'm doing this with money. All right. We're looking good. Intend you. Let's do players,

401
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:50,039
players six. I'm going hard. Yeah, we don't have Kane yet. We get Kane later.

402
01:04:55,099 --> 01:05:01,639
All right. So the next quest after completing this, which will be completed, we have one here.

403
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:08,599
Everybody skipped this. I know you're here to challenge the evil that's driven us from our

404
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,039
ancestral house. My rogue scouts have just reported an abomination in the monastery graveyard.

405
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:20,840
Apparently, you support Satan and worship him on screen. Blood Raven, one of our finest captains

406
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:27,400
in the battle against Diablo at Tristram. Here comes 30 minutes slow mode. Now you'll find her

407
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:33,159
in the monastery graveyard, raising our dead as zombies. We gotta go get Blood Raven.

408
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:37,800
Defilement. 30 minutes slow mode. You want another reason to leave

409
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:45,829
at a player when you add a skeleton. All right. So we're going to go out.

410
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:53,880
How far? How close was the dinner people? I think it was pretty far away.

411
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:00,280
30 minute bone mode. I can't have four skeletons. You guys need to read up on the lore. Look,

412
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,210
it's fun. I can't believe there's five points in Ray's skeleton right now. Okay. The next point

413
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:09,610
in Ray's skeleton, we'll get a fourth skeleton and they're just going to die because they're weak.

414
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:35,340
They're fucking worthless. He hates them. Skeletons are cool. That can be pretty cool. All right. So

415
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:38,539
how far away were we? Where I get it? Let's get a good indicator. So we got to go to the coal

416
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:43,780
plains with the Blood Raven in the burial grounds next to the coal plains. In the world of Diablo

417
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:48,980
two, every single thing is connected to itself. So a lot more is connected to the coal plains,

418
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:52,340
which is connected to the stony field, which is connected to the passage to go to the dark wood,

419
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:58,980
which is connected. Everything is in a row and everything is sort of, kind of, sort of randomly

420
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:07,530
generated. Beware. The evil is strong ahead. It's like seven different patterns. All right.

421
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:14,059
We got a waypoint. First waypoint of the game. I can't believe it's taking an hour to do this.

422
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:19,179
Fuck. God damn it. Hey, stamina shrine. That means I can run forever. All right. How many

423
01:07:19,179 --> 01:07:24,940
plays are it? Okay. Be careful. I have a hard time. This might be too hard.

424
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:44,550
Oh, chip emerald. Armor plus three dexterity. Okay. Let's go drop it. It's a bad item.

425
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:56,809
I'm just going to use it. Bad. They're taking too long. I have to drop the difficulty.

426
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:12,869
Name the skeletons. I can't. The gloves just go on automatically. They just get

427
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:22,600
reanimated anyway. Well, I mean, look at the EXP bar.

428
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:31,300
All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got to drop it. Four of us are whacking on the same guy.

429
01:08:33,699 --> 01:08:37,859
I'll take it to player support.

430
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:54,170
I can do one more skeleton. That's a skill shrine, by the way.

431
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:07,159
All right. We're moving to burial ground. I have to be careful. I really do have to take

432
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:10,199
this slow because you can't just die in a second, but we're going to go find it.

433
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:19,850
All right. Don't just run. Don't fucking run. Oh, that's bad. That's unsafe.

434
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:34,840
I hate skeletons. There's one inside of you. That's actually fine.

435
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:49,989
Okay. I have five skeletons. Don't I count? Technically. Burial grounds. What do you think?

436
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:06,140
Dense and legless pill. Why do you guys keep showing that?

437
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:22,899
That's good. It's very, very good.

438
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:45,260
Burial grounds. Stony field. God damn it. No, that's wrong. We don't want to go this way yet.

439
01:10:47,979 --> 01:10:51,930
I'm sure he said worse. I don't have. I said worse.

440
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:55,770
I'm not even sure why that would be the worst thing I've ever said in my whole life.

441
01:10:56,489 --> 01:11:02,260
Okay. This is stupid. I'll just run up. All right. Okay. This is bad. Very bad. Very bad.

442
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:10,420
Very bad. I have no stamina. Do I have stamina potions? Okay. This is where it ends.

443
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:24,859
Is there a champion in there? Oh, my skeleton. Okay. This is a battle. I have to be very careful.

444
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:26,779
I'm going to level up from this.

445
01:11:52,789 --> 01:11:56,949
Red orb, the health. Yes. Red orb is health and blue orb is mana.

446
01:11:57,350 --> 01:12:18,859
This is the slowest way to play this game. This is the absolute slug way to play Diablo 2.

447
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:29,000
Just stand around and hit each other in the face with rocks. It would be more. All right. Here we

448
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:42,260
go. Necromancer gameplay. Here we go. You ready? Skill. Take a look at what we've got available.

449
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:50,600
Summoning. Poison and bone. Remember, we've got like, and this shield. Curses. That's available

450
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:58,310
up here. Amplify damage. Also, raised skeleton is available and so is skeleton mastery. Please,

451
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:28,020
if you could pick a category. Pick a category now. Is it going to end real quick? Okay. We're

452
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:32,020
already here. So what skill would you like? Remember, the one to the left is available.

453
01:13:32,979 --> 01:13:55,460
Skeleton mastery is available. Holy shit. Really? Okay. Okay. Skeleton mastery is really bad.

454
01:13:56,020 --> 01:14:06,220
I mean, yeah. Well, no, I mean, it could be. Now we make the bone boy strong.

455
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:16,420
Thank you for voting. We'll put that into skeleton mastery. Please choose where the five step.

456
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:19,859
Fucking God damn it. I showed the goddamn fucking mountains. I'm actually pissed about that. All

457
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:24,739
right. Where are we going? By the way, keep in mind, those are not what the points are right

458
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:28,979
now. That's just because Blizzard entertainment sucks and I can't capture the window. You know

459
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:49,500
what I've said that like three times now. Who cares? Vitality again. Oh, hypers. We like mountains.

460
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:57,850
We like mountains. Hype. So I can just click. Yeah. You've become part of the vote. We're

461
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:11,210
doing vitality. Thanks for voting for vitality. It's very useful. All right. Vitality. Bang, bang,

462
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:17,460
bang. We're not 30 vitality, which is okay. That's pretty good. We now 81 health. Skeleton mastery.

463
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:23,079
So our skeletons are going to have plus eight life plus two damage. Pretty good. Okay. Now they're

464
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:35,159
just stronger. We still only have three though. Actually, they are lost. Good decision. Nice job.

465
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:37,720
Okay.

466
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:48,859
I can't wait to do the equivalent for grinding for vials in Bloodborne.

467
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:54,970
When everybody dies and there's like 30 people on the screen and I have to go grind for skeletons

468
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:57,770
for fucking 15 minutes. That's going to be, that's going to be a lot of fun.

469
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:13,640
Wait, that's champion. Champion. Anybody with a net that has a name like that.

470
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:18,840
Of course, they're doing much better. You're doing all right.

471
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:26,439
All right. Come over here. Bite this thing. Is it like electricity? He's immune to fire.

472
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:38,390
All right. Gang up on it. Explode. Does this guy explode? I don't know. He might.

473
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:42,489
Okay. He does. Thank God I moved away.

474
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:51,909
Okay. That's going to kill me. I'm going to die from that. Guaranteed. I guarantee it.

475
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:08,329
Skeletons don't suck. I do. Fresh skeletons. Oh yeah. We had big money coming too like a few

476
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:14,760
times. We had 10 communities up some Super Bruce right now. Thank you, Bruce. We also had enough

477
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:22,680
5,000 bits from phylactery and AG Joe. Thank you both of you. Jesus. I fucking love skeletons.

478
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:28,180
Make sure we go over in detail those at the end of the stream.

479
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:39,159
Thank you guys. Seriously. I probably missed more too. I was too busy yelling at the ceiling.

480
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:44,710
All right. We need to find the barrel. We're going for a boss.

481
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:51,029
I'm still on single digit skeletons. What a rookie.

482
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:05,699
Not even possible to do what you're describing. All right. Is this better?

483
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:13,239
I lose a point in skeleton, but I'll be able to kill things. Two to four, three to six. I'm going

484
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:21,619
to lose. All right. I lose a point in the skeleton. No. Okay. Fine. For health. This thing's broken.

485
01:18:21,619 --> 01:18:29,479
Fuck it. Let's put this to take that. I'm running out of room here. Four to nine throw damage.

486
01:18:30,359 --> 01:18:43,939
Do I have her head on three? Same thing. All right. Let's go. Is this guy streaming Diablo?

487
01:18:43,939 --> 01:18:51,239
Is this guy watching skeletons play Diablo 2 while he streams Diablo 2? All right. Careful.

488
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:54,329
He's a champion. They're harder.

489
01:18:54,329 --> 01:19:01,270
Uh, yes, that is kind of what's happening.

490
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:23,300
This is one handed. No, I can't. I can't do well. All right. We've got to level up. We're not going

491
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:32,409
to use it yet. All right. We came from this was flabby over here. We came from this way, right?

492
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:40,279
Oh yeah. Looking for the burial grounds. Every single, they're all in the edges.

493
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:46,619
Essentially, if you follow the road on here, you see, you'll eventually find something to put a

494
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:58,810
face cam on a skeleton. This is a random dungeon. I don't want to go in there. In fact, let's just,

495
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:04,819
let's find this shit while I have the stamina potion. I can run forever as long as I over there.

496
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:10,250
I want to get swarmed by a bunch of fucking people. Dying here is bad. If I don't make it

497
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:16,890
through act one, then I got to think of some kind of punishment because that come on. I have to do

498
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:29,079
act one burial grounds. Got it. Okay. All right. If I do not, if I die before act one is over,

499
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:36,680
I will do a, I will do a mountain stream or like at least five minutes with like calm music in

500
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:43,539
the background. Who cares? That's what it was. What does that punishment? All right. Hold on.

501
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:47,340
Let me go back. Town portals work the same way they do in the other Diablo games.

502
01:20:51,189 --> 01:21:00,739
Got to kill blood raven. Greetings. Let's sell all this shit. One, sell, sell, sell.

503
01:21:04,779 --> 01:21:11,100
This is a, I need a belt. I can only hold four potions at a time. Do you have a belt? Who has

504
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:21,000
a belt I can buy? Why did I just fucking identify that? All right. Give me a couple of these.

505
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:26,439
All right. I need a belt. Otherwise I'm just going to hold on to these potions in my inventory.

506
01:21:26,439 --> 01:21:37,640
Belt or strength mountain stream promise. Well, I have to beat act one. I sold the last one. What

507
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:52,569
am I stupid? A thousand dollars. All right. This is 200 bucks. So now I get another slot here, but

508
01:21:53,850 --> 01:22:00,060
still have town portals pair. All right. I'm ready. All right. Let's take a look at what we

509
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:06,579
have available. I'm level. All right. So I just, I am level six. We have unlocked and we have

510
01:22:06,579 --> 01:22:11,539
obviously raised skeleton, skeleton mastery. We also now have clay golem rates of golem from the

511
01:22:11,539 --> 01:22:20,279
earth to fight at your side. It's just another little buddy. 60 attack, a hundred defense

512
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:28,520
with a hundred life, two to five damage and a 20% attack bonus. And it slows enemies just to give

513
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:36,470
you an indicator of what that means. So attack 95 and 95 and 50 health. And they do three to four

514
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:44,680
damage. There's a difference. We've also unlocked poison dagger. That's poison to your dagger attacks.

515
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:49,319
I don't have a dagger, but it will make me do a lot more damage. If need be. We have unlocked

516
01:22:49,319 --> 01:22:57,130
that. We still have teeth. We've also unlocked another curse dim vision creates a group of

517
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:02,569
the curse is a group of monsters reducing their vision radius. I'm not, I have no comment on that

518
01:23:02,569 --> 01:23:09,899
because that's, um, this, I am not going to give you a comment because I don't want to influence

519
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:33,779
anybody's opinion. So, uh, what category would you guys like to go to? Sure. Okay. Now in this

520
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:38,340
category, remember you have the top three are available. Clay golem, skeleton mastery and

521
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:46,520
skeletons. We're going back to somebody. Where here would you like to go? He's an influencer.

522
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:52,260
Okay. All right. We've got it. We've this, we've got, we've now we've got it. Now we've got it.

523
01:23:56,409 --> 01:24:00,090
Now we've got some actual, you know, people actually have to think about this shit. Now

524
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:15,430
you're assembling the squad, more skeletons, goblins. Well, it's a golem, not a goblin.

525
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:26,569
Golem, not golem. What did I, I'm stupid. All right. Whoa. What just happened? Whoa, whoa, whoa,

526
01:24:26,569 --> 01:24:36,420
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is going on? Okay. All right.

527
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:40,659
Something. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

528
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:56,970
Do it again. Something fucked up just happened there. Do it again. Something's fishy there.

529
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:15,189
What is happening? What are you, wait, why, why is this possible right now? There's no 10,000

530
01:25:15,189 --> 01:25:40,439
people didn't click. One vote per viewer. Start click map. All right. Now we got it. Now it's

531
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:46,890
actually working. Somebody was cheating. Yeah. There were, there were some, this is

532
01:25:47,850 --> 01:26:04,939
the, do it in mastery. Um, we'll do it. I don't know. Do it. Why would you click bought a Diablo

533
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:14,340
two stream? Cause you really want more skeletons on the screen. I don't know what the fuck to do

534
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:20,659
here because this is, I mean, technically, technically there's a winner. Okay. Three,

535
01:26:22,069 --> 01:26:37,460
two, one. Thank you for voting. Please choose the stat points. Five are going in.

536
01:26:47,739 --> 01:26:53,100
Now all of a sudden everybody wants strength, huh? Now magically, randomly people decide that

537
01:26:53,100 --> 01:27:06,859
that's what they want. You did vitality twice. It's good. Okay. Attack raises skeletons. All

538
01:27:06,859 --> 01:27:14,300
right. All right. All right. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Easy on those mountains for a second.

539
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:29,640
Follow and then worst possible thing you could fucking do. Would you like to see our new friend?

540
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:50,069
He's perfect. Okay. Keep going. Now we have to fight the boss. Everything looks good.

541
01:27:50,069 --> 01:27:58,460
Everything looks good. It's not a skeleton. No, it's not, but I have town portals, right?

542
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:08,569
All right. It's time to get blood raven. Everybody good. Let's go. Too many empty graves.

543
01:28:08,569 --> 01:28:14,170
You made it. This is a poop monster. No, it's a clay monster. It says it in the title of the

544
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:23,529
guy's stream. Here we go. Go. There she is. All right. I can actually die from this like very,

545
01:28:23,529 --> 01:28:54,979
very, very easily. He's absorbing so much damage. He's just a skeleton with extra step.

546
01:29:03,579 --> 01:29:21,659
Dude, we're just fine. This is fine. Good on my friends. Say that now. Nobody even died.

547
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:34,020
All right. Get in there. Let's go. It's around. It's around. Circle, circle, circle, circle,

548
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:47,930
surround. Get her. Come on. Get her. Don't let her get away. Get the dagger, please.

549
01:29:49,050 --> 01:30:22,340
I'm going to be here for a while. Three, two, one. I can't use this, but it's pretty cool.

550
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:27,859
There's a dagger. Nice job, guys. You did a good job. Our first bearer of the game,

551
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:37,060
40 strength required. Don't take that as an opportunity. Don't take that as an opportunity.

552
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:48,010
Charms just have to be in your inventory and they get whatever is the bonus that's on it. So I

553
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:55,289
plus the root of strength. As long as it's in my inventory, I get it. 5% chance to cast level one

554
01:30:55,289 --> 01:31:00,489
amplify damage on striking. More damage to demons. More attack rating, which means you hit

555
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:05,850
more often against demons. Fire damage and 4% life stolen per hit. Cool.

556
01:31:09,189 --> 01:31:22,630
We also get a, we're doing the blood rating quest. We get a companion. Kyle. Kyle. Kyle's back.

557
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:34,520
Respect stranger and the allegiance of the rogues. I have placed several of my best warriors at your

558
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:46,420
disposal. Mod her. Uh, she needs a bow. It is clear that we are facing difficult to comprehend,

559
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:55,140
let alone combat. There is only one Haradrim Sage in the most arcane history and law who could

560
01:31:55,140 --> 01:32:02,380
advise us. You must go to Tristram and find him. We know. All right. We've got to go through the

561
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:07,430
dark wood. There's a tree. This is where it gets a little, this is where the game actually gets a

562
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:13,579
little bit more difficult, especially when we go to Tristram. Uh, this is her inventory.

563
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:23,479
Give her something. Let's go get a bow. Good day. Even if it sucks, doesn't matter as long

564
01:32:23,479 --> 01:32:34,550
you just have one. Uh, $177. Take it. And manna. Do I have anything that has a socket in it?

565
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:46,250
Let's just stash it for now. I'm not going to sell this. Hold on. Maybe I just should sell it.

566
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:49,050
This is just giving you guys incentives that are going to make me have 40 strength.

567
01:32:49,930 --> 01:33:00,779
Control click on an item. What are you talking about? I can't use that. You can't use that.

568
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:16,310
Need to be level five to use this piece of shit. What? All right. Let's go, uh, get Deckard Cain.

569
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:21,319
The level two companion. Oh, that's the problem. That's a huge problem.

570
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:34,090
Good day. I have three portals. That should be enough. Everyone's good to go. Let's move.

571
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:44,619
So we need to go through our memory serves me correctly here. We got to go to stony field

572
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:50,300
and then through the underground passage, right? What are the underground passages of the dark

573
01:33:50,300 --> 01:34:01,699
wood? Yeah. Turn your face came up and play ads. I don't think I'm going to do that. That

574
01:34:01,699 --> 01:34:14,390
doesn't sound like something that I would want to do. I'm good so far. Let's move. Use this.

575
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:21,020
What level two piece of this? All right. You can use this. I'll put that to good use.

576
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:25,449
Every act has a different companion by the way. And we're not even going to care.

577
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:37,050
I have 50 companions anyways, or maybe not. What's this? Germacraft. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

578
01:34:39,609 --> 01:34:49,140
What? Why did I, why did I need to see this? What's the point in me seeing?

579
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,380
It's me holding a diamond pickaxe.

580
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:28,260
All right. All of me. The real test is if I can, I kill and are you'll coming up here in a little

581
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:49,899
bit. I got excited for the club because I just kept seeing me using it as was this an armor

582
01:35:49,899 --> 01:35:56,220
and manna. Yeah. I mean this shit. Look at that. Just go up like and fucking sick. Wait,

583
01:35:56,220 --> 01:36:04,039
you can wear this. Can you? Yes, you can. I wasn't even dying. This is actually going pretty well.

584
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,159
And Dario poison is going to one shot your minions. Yes, that's true. This is going to,

585
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:11,640
it's actually going to be probably a fucking nightmare. It's going to be an absolute

586
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:33,449
nightmare. We shall see how this goes. With that too, can't you?

587
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:45,779
And you're safe now. Going good. Do not die to recognize you.

588
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:59,800
Okay. That's why I killed fucking Diablo with this shit.

589
01:37:03,539 --> 01:37:13,880
I would need to go down and then up. That's what I wanted.

590
01:37:19,529 --> 01:37:34,859
It gets past. Storm. What's it? Storm wing with demon or enchanted. All right. Just let my

591
01:37:35,899 --> 01:37:58,949
friends die here. Skeleton's op like half of exile.

592
01:37:59,909 --> 01:38:03,909
Oh, it depends on what you mean by that because the answer is no, but it could be yes.

593
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:15,859
Out game. Yeah. Why is it doing this?

594
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:26,170
Runs us so loud. I'm crying. Yeah. I don't know why it's doing that.

595
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:44,180
That music's fucking awesome in this game. All right, let's go. I'm going to make my

596
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:50,100
run for it here. This is, this is a little ballsy, but you know, okay.

597
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:54,100
That's too, a little too ballsy potentially.

598
01:38:56,710 --> 01:39:07,399
Where's that at? Level two. I don't want level two though. I want the dark wood.

599
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:14,810
Oh, don't go that way. Don't be a fool. I know, I know, I know, I know. But if I have the

600
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:19,050
stamina potion though, if I have the stamina shrine, then just go for it.

601
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:27,029
You know, you can run faster than everybody else. Oh, his CD key is banned. Yeah, I know. That's

602
01:39:27,029 --> 01:39:43,659
what I'm saying. Why? I didn't do anything. That could have been real bad. Run, run, run, run,

603
01:39:43,659 --> 01:39:49,579
run, run, run. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.

604
01:39:56,550 --> 01:40:01,989
Holy shit. Okay. This is bad. This is very fucking bad. I, I, this is a, why did I do this?

605
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:08,729
All right. Now I'm good. Holy shit. Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.

606
01:40:08,729 --> 01:40:14,729
I can't die right now. I don't want to do a mountain stream for 10 minutes. Where's everybody?

607
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:25,449
Oh shit. That's it. Okay. All right. All right. Oh my God. I'm going to die.

608
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:46,229
Oh my God. People are dying. We're good. We're okay. We're okay. We've used homeward bone.

609
01:40:48,710 --> 01:41:00,890
Everything's going to be just fine. Where's, where are my skeletons? All right. Just stay

610
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:19,180
over there for a second. Why am I already full? I gotta get out of this. Uh, it's probably right

611
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:47,590
up here. My boots are broken. That's too ballsy. Stop. Part of me is actually kind of glad this is

612
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:51,670
happening like this because otherwise this would be, it would be, I'd be all alone in here.

613
01:41:52,310 --> 01:42:07,210
I don't want that. Good, good, good, good, good. Good work. Although this is dead end.

614
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:30,420
Don't die. I'm almost out of stamina. Oh, this is a bad idea. Oh, this is a bad idea. What am I

615
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:34,630
doing? What do I do? I gotta slow down, slow down, slow down, top order. Get out, get out, get out,

616
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:39,029
get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out,

617
01:42:39,029 --> 01:42:43,510
get out of the game. Get out, get out. I need health, health, health right now. No, no, no, no, no, no.

618
01:42:47,399 --> 01:42:55,960
Okay. I almost just died. That was actually, yeah. Cause if that's it, if I'm dead, I can't really

619
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:12,810
seriously have to be careful. No, leave, like actually leave over here. Okay. What is it on

620
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:25,369
player count? Like six. I should probably turn that off and help. Is that it's on four or I'm

621
01:43:25,369 --> 01:43:42,140
gonna set it to three. I got body blocked by everybody standing around that. I got bothered

622
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:54,250
like my own, my own friends. All right, let's pick something. 2000 playthroughs and he has to

623
01:43:54,250 --> 01:44:00,420
play on three. I didn't make any of these decisions. This 30 points in strength right now as a necro.

624
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:10,170
Do you want to stay like that? What do you want me to do about that? That's what I'm saying. When

625
01:44:10,170 --> 01:44:16,229
people come to this dream and they see like, Oh, Diablo two sick. Wow. There's people watching

626
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:21,590
this. I love Diablo two. What's this idiot doing? Somebody help him. Please help him.

627
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:29,449
All right. What are we doing for, uh, you know what to do? Well, actually take a look where here's

628
01:44:29,449 --> 01:44:36,489
what we have raised skeleton, like golem. You can do another point in the clay. Golem will increase

629
01:44:36,489 --> 01:44:40,970
the health and everything, make them better. Poison and bone. Same ones are available. Poison, dagger,

630
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:47,560
teeth, bone armor. This is survivability. This is me actually being able to do anything else

631
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:53,960
besides stand around and hit with a stick. And we also have dim vision and amplify damage.

632
01:44:55,479 --> 01:45:16,149
Seeing what they do. Okay. Here we go. Where are we going? I'm going to keep quiet.

633
01:45:17,029 --> 01:45:40,630
I don't want to influence anything. Why does this keep happening? And again, all right,

634
01:45:40,630 --> 01:45:47,659
I have the check box set for only allow one click per user. But if I reset the poll, I have to do

635
01:45:47,659 --> 01:46:02,680
that. Okay. Here we go. Here it is again. You need an updated screenshot. I might as well just open

636
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:18,890
up like a webpage and just show it on there. I'm closing it in 10 seconds. Poison and bone it is.

637
01:46:19,689 --> 01:46:39,260
Okay. Uh, remember I'll show you again what we have available here. Teeth, bone armor, poison,

638
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:50,710
dagger. That is what's currently available right now. God damn it. Whatever. All right. What do you

639
01:46:50,710 --> 01:47:11,289
want? It's up to you. Nice background. Whatever. Hey, uh, Jeremiah, I don't mean to backseat,

640
01:47:11,289 --> 01:47:22,819
but this is not a good build. Really? Damn. I, I thought this was going to be really good.

641
01:47:22,819 --> 01:47:28,180
I thought I was going to be able to get the first boss. All right. Let's do teeth. Good choice.

642
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:41,739
Not really. Cause I have no mana. How the hell am I going to cast this? Uh, two teeth come out.

643
01:47:41,739 --> 01:47:54,500
It does two to four damage now. Here we go. Here are my current stats right now.

644
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:57,140
Just to make sure you guys see that what the image you're going to see is a little outdated.

645
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:19,260
Okay. Take a step using the F keys. You have to. All right. All right. Not bad decisions so far.

646
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:44,340
Not bad. Could be way worse. Energy sucks. All right. All right. Five points of going

647
01:48:44,340 --> 01:49:00,539
in energy. Let's go. Thanks everybody. We repair and okay. So this is a day. This is a very dangerous

648
01:49:00,539 --> 01:49:14,489
portal, right? This is that this portal will kill me. I have to be careful. I'm going to make a

649
01:49:14,489 --> 01:49:18,329
portal immediately when going through this portal and you're going to, we're going to do something

650
01:49:18,329 --> 01:49:23,819
to cast teeth at people. Let's do it. Three, two, one, go.

651
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:46,680
Dude fog. What's the level up again? Wait, why am I going to, why am I leveling up so fast?

652
01:49:46,680 --> 01:50:03,479
Wait, what? What's happened? How did I level up so fast? Cheating? Am I? I don't think so.

653
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:23,130
Are we doing skeleton doll life? This is how you got banned. I was so pissed off when I saw that.

654
01:50:23,850 --> 01:50:30,039
Oh, and I can't even get another CD key. That's the worst part. I have to buy the game and send

655
01:50:30,039 --> 01:50:51,880
it to somebody else. But then they have to open it and give me their CD key. Make a new account.

656
01:50:51,880 --> 01:51:09,189
Yeah. I would have to make a brand new account on battle net to buy Diablo two again. This is

657
01:51:09,189 --> 01:51:16,310
going really well. I'm going to make a prediction. I'm going to beat and Ariel is the first major

658
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:19,430
boss of the game. By the way, we're going to get a first unique in the game. You should be excited

659
01:51:19,430 --> 01:51:30,100
about that. It's going to be very hectic. I'm going to be very scared. It's okay because I'll

660
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:47,909
have a couple of friends, large acts, 35 strength. Can use it. I do more damage just by swinging

661
01:51:47,909 --> 01:51:53,270
because I have so much strength. Okay. So this is, this is why this is so dumb. So you pick teeth,

662
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:57,909
which is fine, but I do more damage by swinging because I have 30 strength.

663
01:51:58,069 --> 01:52:12,010
Okay. So I may as well put on that two handed weapon. You know what I mean? At this point,

664
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:23,220
it's sort of a lost cause. We're going to have multiple points. Your hit rate is 10%.

665
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:27,449
That's yeah, that's right. All right. Dark wood. Here we are.

666
01:52:29,479 --> 01:52:35,239
Uh, get this out of here. I don't want this. Now we're looking for the tree.

667
01:52:42,649 --> 01:52:46,329
Get away from me. Somebody with electricity in it. Somebody with electricity. Electricity,

668
01:52:46,329 --> 01:52:50,729
the worst thing in the whole game. Who has electricity? Who has electricity on them?

669
01:52:57,909 --> 01:53:01,829
I don't see anybody in there with electricity, but why did that come up? Who has it? Yep.

670
01:53:01,829 --> 01:53:11,960
There's somebody in there that has it. I see them. Oh my God. Okay. Run. One skeleton. That's not

671
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:31,000
good. We're good. We're good. Don't get hit by the lightning. I got to kill. This is shaman

672
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:43,739
somewhere. There you are. It's too stressful. Why did I want to do this? This is too stressful.

673
01:53:43,739 --> 01:53:46,300
It really is. Especially when you get a little bit later here.

674
01:53:54,069 --> 01:54:10,260
I have to kill the guys with the staff. Help me skeleton. All right. He's one dead.

675
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:17,159
Where's my golem? All right. My golem is he's doing a good job. He's currently surrounded.

676
01:54:19,289 --> 01:54:27,380
What? Where? Okay. Where's another shaman dead? There you are. Oh, you motherfuckers. This is

677
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:42,500
ridiculous. Oh my God. This is a mess. This is an actual mess. I have to leave and level up again,

678
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:56,659
I think. Yep. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. No. What? Yeah. Actually

679
01:54:56,659 --> 01:55:11,350
put a safe teleporter down here. Okay. Do I have any money? Get rid of this. No saw. Wait.

680
01:55:11,909 --> 01:55:20,250
22 attack rating. Should just put it in. Who cares? All right. I need load up potions.

681
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:30,899
How many do I have? I get some more. Okay. What level are we now? We are level eight. We have

682
01:55:30,899 --> 01:55:38,600
opened up a couple of new things because you put a point to teeth. One point is in teeth right now.

683
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:45,909
It just increases the amount of teeth and the amount of damage. Armor as well. There's corpse

684
01:55:45,909 --> 01:55:50,390
explosion. Cast on the corpse of a slain monster. It explodes damaging nearby enemy.

685
01:55:51,029 --> 01:55:59,859
Okay. Pretty good. Poison dagger. That's what's available in poison and bone. We have still the

686
01:55:59,859 --> 01:56:04,340
same curses available. Amplify and envision and we still have the same summoning ability.

687
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:14,500
Do not get new ones until level 12. Roll over so you can see what would happen if I put a

688
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:31,460
point into these. Okay. All right. So you've seen it. Please choose a category if you would.

689
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:45,319
He thinks anyone cares. That's kind of the point of the stream is to have people pick something

690
01:56:45,319 --> 01:56:53,640
crazy for a hardcore. He thinks anyone cares. Oh, don't be so mean. Why are you being so mean?

691
01:56:53,640 --> 01:57:17,979
Kind of torn, but it looks like summoning. Okay. Good. Oh, we're still in summoning. So

692
01:57:17,979 --> 01:57:22,220
you only have three choices here. Two into play golem. Another one into, you only have three

693
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:36,890
options. Go ahead and pick one. Well, that's a hundred percent. This will make four skeletons.

694
01:57:38,229 --> 01:57:49,000
He's going to start crying. Well, that's, there's no coming back from this 76% one another skeleton.

695
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:11,300
This will be a level of six points into skeleton, which will get us to four skeletons. There's now

696
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:16,340
time to choose some. Well, I'll show you here. Here's where the stats currently stand. 30, 25,

697
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:24,149
30, 30, 30, 25, 30, 30. Those are where the stats are right now.

698
01:58:24,949 --> 01:58:51,579
Where am I going? Yeah. I've never done anything like this before in this game. So this is kind

699
01:58:51,579 --> 01:59:03,060
of an interesting, I mean, I guess I can hit things harder. Does that, well, I'll be able to

700
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:17,539
wear some really, really heavy armor. Thanks for voting everybody. That'll bring us to

701
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:41,270
to 35 strength. Can I, uh, one, look at, okay. One to 27 damage. That is so terrible.

702
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:52,359
All right. Let's bring, let's resurrect Kyle. All right. We need to, how many, how many,

703
01:59:52,359 --> 01:59:55,399
what do I have for, all right. I only, let me get some more portals. I only have one.

704
01:59:56,119 --> 02:00:16,550
Okay. I feel safe now. Fresh. I can get four skeletons. Can I resurrect anybody here? No.

705
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:38,460
All right. Let's go. Three, two, one. Let's go. Fuck. Oh my God. Don't do it. The champion's

706
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:51,350
almost dead. Get in there. What are you doing? Get in there. He's just standing around. Get in

707
02:00:51,350 --> 02:01:07,050
the fight. She's still alive. First she's in here somewhere. She dead. I don't know. Just kill the

708
02:01:07,050 --> 02:01:26,899
doctors. Yeah. She's right there. The blue one. Oh, okay. I can't even walk over there.

709
02:01:27,939 --> 02:01:45,720
Don't please kill her. Kill demon lightning enchantment. The worst die. I leveled up again.

710
02:01:49,609 --> 02:02:00,149
Nice. Good work. It is hard leather armor here. God damn it. I didn't mean to do that. 15 to

711
02:02:00,149 --> 02:02:16,579
strength. What's it got? 21 defense. I'd rather have that than the health. You see what, okay.

712
02:02:16,579 --> 02:02:33,699
Go ahead. If I put on the huge ax, I lose a skeleton. That's true.

713
02:02:34,659 --> 02:02:51,109
Keep that in mind. Do bugleberry right now or riot. I'm not going to do that. Okay. You do have

714
02:02:51,109 --> 02:03:04,840
another point to put in. Let's go ahead and do this first. I mean, if you look, if you're going to

715
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:14,069
make me do this, then I have, look at two to five, two to 40. That's it. This is good, but I lost a

716
02:03:14,069 --> 02:03:23,130
skeleton. Here's what's available. The same ones from last time. Obviously corpse explosion, teeth,

717
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:31,260
bone armor, skeleton, which we lost it because we had plus one from the wand and also one and one

718
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:38,920
in skeleton mastery and in clay foam. Please choose the category if you would. I appreciate it.

719
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:58,699
We lost a friend. Bring back friend. Yeah. Use that skill point and compensate.

720
02:03:59,819 --> 02:04:09,300
I'm actually going to be pretty useful though. Okay. Well, what do you want to up? You have,

721
02:04:09,939 --> 02:04:15,300
you could, you could do skeleton mastery, clay golem, or replace the skeleton that we just

722
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:46,649
lost. Remember you're going to get clapped in the dirt before end areal. I don't think so. Okay.

723
02:04:46,649 --> 02:04:54,600
Four skeletons. This is what they currently have for a bonus. We are level nine. Let's go.

724
02:04:55,399 --> 02:05:06,859
How slow is this? It's pretty slow, but I feel like it's going to be kind of good.

725
02:05:06,859 --> 02:05:23,939
Oh, look at the tree. It's too many people. I'm one hit killing everything though.

726
02:05:23,939 --> 02:05:31,699
So it's not terrible. He's not picking up the gold. I'm trying to stay alive.

727
02:05:44,539 --> 02:05:57,819
Actually not that bad. Swole man, sir. Oh, she leveled up. Grand charm. Give me

728
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:06,199
running around with a two handed sword as an answer.

729
02:06:06,199 --> 02:06:14,310
All right. Let's do one. We need to find the, uh, the tree. And when I find the tree,

730
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:21,260
it's instantly run away from the tree because it's, you're guaranteed to die. If you do not

731
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:41,430
run instantly away from the tree, the tree is scary. Yes, it is hard. No, I don't want it.

732
02:06:45,899 --> 02:06:49,899
Tree fist is going to kill them. Don't say that because it's potentially accurate.

733
02:06:52,119 --> 02:07:18,789
It's so scary when you find the tree because they just sprint at you. All right. That's good.

734
02:07:18,789 --> 02:07:23,770
Six to life. What do I have right now? Is it strength? No, keep the strength on.

735
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:42,710
Trying to pay attention to him. He's still, he was like a week ago, but he's still recovering.

736
02:07:45,579 --> 02:07:50,699
Show us that. I don't see at least a thousand cog champs right now. I will turn the stream off.

737
02:07:51,819 --> 02:08:04,619
I'm going to count. Hey, good. Nice work. I knew you guys could do it.

738
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:15,689
Ooh, they're terrible. 10% fast, one to dexterity, cold. At least it's cold resistant.

739
02:08:15,689 --> 02:08:21,350
Better than what I had on. I have six cold resist. Holy fuck. That's a lot of pogs.

740
02:08:23,819 --> 02:08:26,460
All right. Give me the gold. People are yelling at me, but I'll pick it up the gold. And yes,

741
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:37,939
I know. I agree. I need it. I'm going to put another, uh, I was on the, I just did another

742
02:08:37,939 --> 02:08:51,369
hog. I don't know why. If Kyle stuff, no, I'm going to dump Kyle pretty soon here.

743
02:08:56,310 --> 02:09:03,189
Large acts. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What do I have? Um, this shit's

744
02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:26,579
he hates Kyle. No, I don't level up. This actually might make and Ariel easier because I can

745
02:09:26,579 --> 02:09:34,439
actually swing and I'm going to do damage. This might be, I'm not, I'm not scared at the moment.

746
02:09:34,439 --> 02:09:49,050
I will be in a little bit though. Play point. Thank God. All right. Give me a second. It's all

747
02:09:49,050 --> 02:09:58,680
part of the plan. Trust chat. Well, it's hard to do that. Right. I still have, uh, no sockets.

748
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:02,199
Right. When I get the cube, you can eventually combine these, but they're going to be worthless

749
02:10:02,199 --> 02:10:14,970
in about 40 minutes. How many keys do I have? I have too many mana potions. Why do I even have

750
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:30,069
these? Absolutely useless. Dude, two minutes of gameplay, 10 minutes of leveling up. Yeah,

751
02:10:30,069 --> 02:10:42,069
you know it. Let's go. All right. Well, we got this. We got you with same choices. Same choices

752
02:10:42,069 --> 02:10:47,109
are available. We still have four skeletons, skeleton masteries available. Golem is available.

753
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:54,810
We still have corpse explosion, which is available. Bone armor, poison dagger is still curses

754
02:10:54,810 --> 02:11:03,510
available. Here's what will happen if you put a point into this. Damage goes up by a little bit.

755
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:08,939
It also happens here. Increases life and damage of raised skeletons and revived creatures.

756
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:14,979
And then amplify damages is incredible, but it's not my choice. Okay. Go ahead and pick.

757
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:32,409
These will start slowing down as we level up though. Don't worry. As always, it looks like

758
02:11:32,409 --> 02:11:48,789
we're going to skeleton. Are we? Or do I just assume the worst? Okay. Well, we're on the right

759
02:11:48,789 --> 02:12:08,949
page. Uh, which one? All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Corpse explosion, resident sleeper, skeleton

760
02:12:08,949 --> 02:12:26,119
population explosion, pog champ. It is going into skeleton mastery. Uh, what about stats?

761
02:12:27,159 --> 02:12:31,399
Strength, dexterity, vitality, energy, which one?

762
02:12:48,819 --> 02:13:03,909
Getting smarter. They're getting smarter. That's good. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. Don't downplay

763
02:13:03,909 --> 02:13:20,149
yourself. You just pick the one you did is good. So we're doing skeleton mastery, which will go up

764
02:13:20,149 --> 02:13:27,640
from life 8%. It's just doubling their life eventually damage. So now let's see what they

765
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:35,399
do with three to five damage and they have 60 health, six to seven damage, and they have 68

766
02:13:35,399 --> 02:13:48,579
health. So now they're going to be pretty good, not terrible play. And then everything else looks

767
02:13:48,579 --> 02:14:08,340
good. Let's go. Dude, pod three minutes to gameplay. Here it comes. Magic find is really good,

768
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:16,329
but I'll keep the strength on. Oh shit. Watch out. He's a chump. Let's kill him.

769
02:14:21,529 --> 02:14:26,890
Best opportunity to get prayers and uniques is from named enemies. Right.

770
02:14:27,210 --> 02:14:40,460
Dude, fucking residence sleeper gameplay. What is this shit? I want to see level it up.

771
02:14:41,579 --> 02:14:55,500
Where's the tree? I think it's right over here. Damage shrine. Good. Very useful. Let's go. Don't

772
02:14:55,500 --> 02:15:12,520
get overwhelmed. Three, three, three, three, three. Still no tree. This house is burning, but

773
02:15:14,039 --> 02:15:21,979
free. I would take that skill shrine, but I don't want it because I wouldn't be able to run.

774
02:15:22,699 --> 02:15:33,829
Where the hell is it? I got the waypoint. What's the over under on me? Screaming when tree

775
02:15:33,829 --> 02:15:39,829
fist appears. Ah, it depends. How does the game lag and does he instantly teleport next to me?

776
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:54,630
Is that what happens? Probably this way. Depends on who sees who first. Yes, it does. All right.

777
02:15:54,630 --> 02:16:02,949
Slow down. I need my skeleton. There he is. There he is. Okay. All right. There he is. There he is.

778
02:16:02,949 --> 02:16:20,649
I didn't scream. I didn't scream. He's not even that bad. He's fine. I'm good. He walked right

779
02:16:20,649 --> 02:16:35,610
into the okay. He just got destroyed. That wouldn't even scared. That was easy. There's the tree.

780
02:16:36,329 --> 02:16:46,309
This tree shines with inner spirits. What did he drop? Anything good? I am overburdened.

781
02:16:49,079 --> 02:16:54,340
Free defense. That sucks. And I'll keep that on you. You wear this.

782
02:16:56,500 --> 02:17:00,700
There's a scroll. Look at all these potions I have. What a waste of space.

783
02:17:02,059 --> 02:17:10,500
Waste of space. These are I'm going to sell some shit. All right. Now we're going to go to Stony

784
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:17,319
Field and go to Tristram and hopefully not lose. Hey, are you winning? Are you winning?

785
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:26,760
You must find the cairn stones and touch them in the order that I have written.

786
02:17:27,479 --> 02:17:32,920
Yes, we do. Go to the cairn stones in the Stony Field. Touch the stones in the order of the scroll.

787
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:39,420
What was the thing everyone was saying? Will? Well, there was at least a few people that said

788
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:47,739
will he get past Rakaneshu. This is the real test, I think. Coming up right now. All right.

789
02:17:47,739 --> 02:17:55,670
Let's get rid of some of this shit. Like get out of here. Put the magic find on instead. Sure.

790
02:17:59,639 --> 02:18:27,270
Okay. Stash some of this shit. Do I keep this stuff on? Eh, it's fine. Okay. Now we have to

791
02:18:27,270 --> 02:18:33,270
go to the Stony Field, which is further back. Pole Plane, Stony Field. I think I already did.

792
02:18:33,270 --> 02:18:39,430
I found it. Didn't I already before? Yeah, it's right down here. Look at that. We're already

793
02:18:39,430 --> 02:18:52,819
ready to go. Wrong. Did I do the Countess? I did not. I may skip the Countess and go right for

794
02:18:52,819 --> 02:18:57,209
Endereal. I know that's a terrible idea, but sometimes you got to go for the hard play.

795
02:18:57,770 --> 02:19:10,219
Look at the Stony Field. Oh, EXP Shrine. Kill. Come on. You get like triple the amount of

796
02:19:10,219 --> 02:19:24,059
experience. How do I have no stamina? Doesn't make any sense. Kill something quick, please.

797
02:19:24,700 --> 02:19:39,290
I gotta get back on the road. These Countess skip people equals skipping levels. Yeah. I mean,

798
02:19:39,290 --> 02:19:49,290
the end of Act 1 is actually pretty hard. Is this Stony Field or is this Burial Grounds?

799
02:19:49,930 --> 02:19:56,569
Is that Burial Grounds? It's Burial Grounds. All right. It's up there.

800
02:19:57,129 --> 02:20:03,049
Oh, I got Stand Stills with my stupid ass stamina can refill. Why don't you stack stamina potions?

801
02:20:03,049 --> 02:20:25,000
Because I forgot that we have 40 points in strength. I forgot. Go, go, go, go, go.

802
02:20:25,959 --> 02:20:30,520
Tristram, pause the game. I have to go. There is no pause in Diablo. Yes, there is. What?

803
02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:40,420
Oh, I'm not playing online, right? Yeah, there is. Pause the game. Not yet. We're not going to.

804
02:20:40,420 --> 02:20:46,059
Our first break is coming soon. After I go through Tristram, we'll do our first break.

805
02:20:46,059 --> 02:20:52,440
I'm in it for the long haul tonight, guys. I want to see just how far I can get

806
02:20:53,079 --> 02:21:00,940
before reliably turning the stream off and being safe. Pause. What about my pizza roll?

807
02:21:01,899 --> 02:21:09,340
You'll be OK. Look for the stones. You'll know when I find the stones when you see a blue guy.

808
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:27,110
We're looking for the blue guy. Give me that. I'd rather have that right now.

809
02:21:28,069 --> 02:21:34,459
Who cares about the experience? I'll get it. Stones, stones. Found it. OK. OK. Run, run, run, run.

810
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:38,620
All right. Let's go. I'll leave it to Shirley. We'll take this out.

811
02:21:38,620 --> 02:22:05,819
Any shamas over here? There he is. Go get him. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

812
02:22:10,780 --> 02:22:28,680
Why is Teeth selected? Why is Teeth selected? Why is he chasing me? Nice. All right. Turn it on.

813
02:22:29,239 --> 02:22:47,590
What about Griswold, though? He's scary. Good Tristram. 21, 21. Sucks. All right.

814
02:22:48,389 --> 02:22:54,299
All that's left of proud Tristram are ghosts and ashes. We have four skeletons.

815
02:22:54,860 --> 02:23:17,020
Let's go. Take it slow. There's no reason to do this fast. Holy shit. OK. We'll run.

816
02:23:18,940 --> 02:23:28,440
He can do amplify damage to you. So I gotta be careful. Like that. No. Actually, I did that.

817
02:23:29,319 --> 02:23:32,840
Oh, that's right. This thing has a 5% chance to amplify damage. For God's sake.

818
02:23:48,809 --> 02:24:06,090
Die. Run. Run away. He didn't drop anything. He dropped shit. All right. We're good. Keep going.

819
02:24:06,649 --> 02:24:22,940
Dammit, a potion. Get it. OK. This is where we get Wirt's leg.

820
02:24:26,739 --> 02:24:47,340
My goal is to kill the shamas. That's all I'm going to do. OK. He's left. Right here. Champions.

821
02:24:47,979 --> 02:24:58,440
There's Wirt. I do a lot of damage to this thing. It's actually kind of good. All right. Here we go.

822
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:17,989
Where's Wirt? Where is he? Right here. Two to eight. One to 27. I could. All right. I might

823
02:25:17,989 --> 02:25:43,129
actually use this. I might just put like three gems in it. Go get Deckard Cain. He's in here,

824
02:25:43,129 --> 02:25:54,120
surrounded by people. Help. Help. Deckard Cain. Move quickly. And that's barbarian. Wrong person.

825
02:26:06,409 --> 02:26:25,590
Say the rest. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. We got two levels up.

826
02:26:27,719 --> 02:26:34,200
Am I level 10? Level 12. Wow. We're moving right along. Level 12. Are you kidding me?

827
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:51,100
This is fucking easy. The game's not even fucking hard. All right. Let's get out. I got a lot of

828
02:26:51,100 --> 02:27:02,500
damage. We made it. Here he is. Hello. As a token of my gratitude, I will identify items for you at

829
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:09,219
no charge. Regrettably, I could do nothing to. I could do nothing to prevent the disaster which

830
02:27:09,219 --> 02:27:16,899
devastated Tristram. It would appear that our greatest fears have come to pass. Diablo,

831
02:27:16,899 --> 02:27:19,540
the Lord of Terror, has once again been set loose upon the world. Our greatest fear has

832
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:25,940
come to pass. Chat has made an acromancer with 40 strength. As you know, some time ago, Diablo

833
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:37,110
was straining against Tristram. He might as well just go home. Let one of the adults take over.

834
02:27:39,350 --> 02:27:43,989
Yet as the weeks passed, our hero became increasingly aloof.

835
02:27:44,549 --> 02:27:50,149
He kept his distance from the rest of the townsfolk and. There's no way you can beat Diablo

836
02:27:50,149 --> 02:27:58,250
with that shit, Bill. Perhaps his ordeal had been so disturbing that he simply could not put it out

837
02:27:58,250 --> 02:28:06,520
of his mind. Okay, fine. Stay awhile and listen. Hey, I ate some food and you're still alive. Good

838
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:11,479
job. Yeah, we're doing fine. You have risked your life. Oh yeah, you get a ring doing this

839
02:28:11,479 --> 02:28:14,760
and then it always just sucks. Nice magic damage reduced by one.

840
02:28:15,559 --> 02:28:26,059
There's probably more nutritional value inside that ring from a box of lucky charms. You know

841
02:28:26,059 --> 02:28:30,780
what I'm trying to say. All right, let's sell. Have we got what levels up to do? And then we're

842
02:28:30,780 --> 02:28:34,059
going, we're going for it. We're going for our Dario. Fuck it. I'm going, we're going right for

843
02:28:34,059 --> 02:28:56,979
it. This is where it gets hard. I have a keyboard's leg. Uh, it's time to gamble. He's getting too

844
02:28:57,540 --> 02:29:09,989
confident. It's fine. Hey, good day to you. I'm good. I'd never have to lay my eyes on one of

845
02:29:09,989 --> 02:29:20,899
your kind. You didn't even do it. Yes. A gambling is you don't know what it is, but it could be a

846
02:29:20,899 --> 02:29:28,010
rare. I have $5,000. What do I need to replace? Uh, this is this shit. You can give me something

847
02:29:28,010 --> 02:29:34,700
better than this belt. Should I try to get a better belt? I still have gloves. These gloves

848
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:49,430
are so bad gloves. All right. That was bad. Heavy armor. Yeah. I can wear it. Can I,

849
02:29:50,229 --> 02:30:05,159
I think I can wear it. Sword. I go for sword or club rings. The rings are 63,000 Goldie

850
02:30:07,479 --> 02:30:15,049
new armor. Yeah. Let's, let's see if we can get some armor. All right. Chain mail 18,000.

851
02:30:15,049 --> 02:30:21,049
All right. Here we go. I don't have enough money. This shit just drops on the ground.

852
02:30:21,530 --> 02:30:36,149
Does he hate the music that I should be turned off? Oh, I want this. All right. That's better.

853
02:30:36,149 --> 02:30:43,559
Now I'll have more slots. Seven life, three mana. Let's go. See that was worth it. All right. I'm

854
02:30:43,559 --> 02:30:52,120
done. I'm done, done, done, done, done, done. Put this shit in here. My favorite part about this

855
02:30:52,120 --> 02:31:01,110
game is organizing gems. It's just somehow satisfying to me. I've got potions. I need

856
02:31:01,110 --> 02:31:14,600
another row. Yeah. I'm going to just buy like two or three. Wait, I'm just, I'm buying back the ones

857
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:31,350
I sold. What the fuck is going on? All right. So we have 10 stat points to put in. Where do you

858
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:38,809
want me to put 10 stat points? We're doing well. 10 points. Where do you want them? Take a look.

859
02:31:38,809 --> 02:32:11,030
Is that what it looks like? Mountains? Any mountains? Hey Otto, what are you doing over there?

860
02:32:15,059 --> 02:32:26,329
Any mountain fans in here? All right. 10 points are going to strength. I'm going to be the heaviest

861
02:32:27,290 --> 02:32:42,360
acrobat ever. Okay. What about, we have two points. Let's take a look at what we have

862
02:32:42,360 --> 02:32:51,909
and some new stuff though. So check it out. First, let's do this. That was painful to do.

863
02:32:54,729 --> 02:33:01,299
So we have a couple of new things here. Again, we have, here's what happens with Ray's skeleton.

864
02:33:01,299 --> 02:33:11,239
We have skeleton mastery still. We do not get a fifth skeleton. Play Golem. We've Golem mastery

865
02:33:11,239 --> 02:33:18,579
has unlocked. Enhances speed and life of your Golems. More health and more attack and they

866
02:33:18,579 --> 02:33:28,950
walk faster. Or skeleton mage. Just like regular skeleton, it revives a, this adds to your skeleton

867
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:38,010
pool and it's a mage, not melee. It shoots ice, fire, lightning, et cetera. They're a lot weaker,

868
02:33:38,010 --> 02:33:45,639
but they still get skeleton mastery. Still get a bonus from this.

869
02:33:49,159 --> 02:33:54,600
You can't do anything here because no one's picking anything here. This all remains the same.

870
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:59,719
Poison Dagger, teeth, bone armor is the same. Curses has not been clicked on once, so we can't

871
02:33:59,719 --> 02:34:07,059
go further down. But if you did, this weaken, which makes everybody that you touch with this do 33%

872
02:34:07,059 --> 02:34:14,520
less damage. It's Iron Maiden, which when they do damage, it hurts themselves. It's a thorns.

873
02:34:15,159 --> 02:34:21,020
So they do 200% damage returned back at them. Terror just makes people run away.

874
02:34:21,579 --> 02:34:28,180
Nobody wants to do curses, apparently. So, and now that you see these, you know what they do.

875
02:34:28,819 --> 02:34:35,000
Where would you like to go? This is for the first point, by the way. Please pick the category.

876
02:34:35,959 --> 02:34:56,549
People are already clicking it. Hey, hey you. Hey you little, hey you little dork.

877
02:34:59,049 --> 02:35:06,540
All right. Okay. We're on skeletons. We're on summoning spells already and that's where you

878
02:35:06,540 --> 02:35:30,379
want to go. Which one? Skeleton mage is. So that's the first point. Where would you like the second

879
02:35:30,379 --> 02:35:50,059
point? What a category. Or we just do it again. I guess we already know. I guess we already know.

880
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:58,790
Hey dude, great necro build. This actually is not even that different than just making a

881
02:35:58,790 --> 02:36:09,000
summoning build anyway, so not too big of a problem. Okay. We're doing another point into

882
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:15,350
skeleton mage. See, a lot of you guys think you're doing some crazy weird impossible build,

883
02:36:15,909 --> 02:36:19,110
but you're just going to make it hard for me to beat bosses, and then I have to figure it out on

884
02:36:19,110 --> 02:36:33,639
my own. So we've got skeletal mage. One. Skeletal. Uh oh. We have to be level 13 for this one. Uh oh.

885
02:36:33,639 --> 02:36:59,030
Pick something else. Now you could save points too. You don't have to spend them until you figure

886
02:36:59,030 --> 02:37:09,159
out what you want to do. You don't have to spend them right now. We can do curses. Okay.

887
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:14,520
Don't influence us. I'm just saying, you don't have to spend your points until maybe you figure

888
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:22,950
out what you want to do. You don't have to spend every point. All right. So just to refresh your

889
02:37:22,950 --> 02:37:30,600
memory because this is an inaccurate list. Very currently available curses. Invision and amplify

890
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:36,899
damage. Everything takes a hundred percent more damage or make them so they can't see very well.

891
02:37:37,459 --> 02:38:03,940
Any mountain fans in the area? Curses equal lame. Well, it depends how you use them.

892
02:38:04,739 --> 02:38:18,340
This actually will be very, very good. Okay. Good choice. And I mean that, actually, I don't mean

893
02:38:18,340 --> 02:38:27,129
that as a joke. That's actually a really good thing to have with summoning build. Put on the bar. I've

894
02:38:27,129 --> 02:38:41,799
got a couple things to put on the bar. So we're going to do F1, F3, F4. Okay. We have a skeletal

895
02:38:41,799 --> 02:38:46,920
mage. Now we can summon, which is a different button. I'm also going to go P. So let's take

896
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:50,280
a quick little break for the first time. I'll be right back and we'll continue.

897
02:42:29,299 --> 02:45:51,610
Okay. Sorry about that. Take care of Otto. Make sure he was doing okay.

898
02:45:52,889 --> 02:46:03,590
All right. We've selected everything, right? I'm going to keep an eye on him. He's my special boy.

899
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:22,940
All right. All right. What was on tap here? I don't remember.

900
02:46:24,059 --> 02:46:35,530
I'm Dario. Greetings. When I fled the monastery, my enchanted smithing hammer. If you can retrieve

901
02:46:35,530 --> 02:46:45,430
it for me, I'll use its magic to strengthen your equipment. Okay. So it's so odd seeing this as a

902
02:46:45,430 --> 02:46:51,030
fucking necromancer. Oh, we did that one. We could do this, but nah, we don't need it.

903
02:46:52,229 --> 02:47:01,420
This is on the way. Idiot streamer sucks at Diablo. We got to get...

904
02:47:08,200 --> 02:47:12,120
I need... Okay. We got to go from here to here. It's going to be quite a journey.

905
02:47:13,180 --> 02:47:20,280
Do all quests with an angry face. We don't need... I'll go back and do them.

906
02:47:31,270 --> 02:47:40,979
I'm looking for the... What is it called? The black marsh? That's the one. Oh, a ring.

907
02:47:45,780 --> 02:47:53,559
Yeah. Light radius and attack rating. That's good. Why are there so many skeletons? Well, because

908
02:47:56,180 --> 02:47:57,940
chat wants to have chat on screen.

909
02:47:59,940 --> 02:48:05,659
There's going to be a bunch of them. Somebody redeemed a wing.

910
02:48:06,219 --> 02:48:38,760
Hey, no, they didn't. Not right now. Did they? Did they? Oh, it was fucking fake. God damn it.

911
02:48:41,989 --> 02:48:44,629
I need to... I need a way to track that on my own screen. Seriously.

912
02:48:46,600 --> 02:48:50,120
I have to... I guess I gotta track that. Otherwise people will just keep doing that forever.

913
02:48:50,920 --> 02:49:00,780
All right. With me, with me, with me, with me, with me. Black marsh. We're making a run for it.

914
02:49:03,219 --> 02:49:08,819
Read the chat. But when there's 5,000 people in the chat room.

915
02:49:09,620 --> 02:49:19,450
Somebody redeems a wink and one second goes by. It might be off the screen. I need a way to keep

916
02:49:19,450 --> 02:49:49,799
track of it. Oh, look, there's another one. Oh, really? No way. Come on, run on the edge.

917
02:49:55,430 --> 02:50:03,620
No, there was no real wink. I would have saw it. It'll show up on my dashboard. Is that for real?

918
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:26,600
Where? Reward requests? Is that it? Okay. Reward request is currently on. I don't see anything.

919
02:50:31,780 --> 02:50:38,340
Don't ever alt tab during a hardcore game. Seriously, I'm gonna... I wonder if he's gonna

920
02:50:38,340 --> 02:50:43,139
die to Andariel. No, no, no. I'm gonna alt tab and die to a one random person hitting me.

921
02:50:44,020 --> 02:51:00,299
All right. It's up there. I didn't bring very many of these. I only got one.

922
02:51:02,500 --> 02:51:10,780
I'm gonna go buy more of those. I'm gonna spend like all my money on it. Great. At least I have

923
02:51:10,780 --> 02:51:18,440
an army protecting me. Yeah, that's true. But if I go too far ahead of the army and they don't

924
02:51:18,440 --> 02:51:35,350
teleport quick enough, I'm gonna die. I have to go Black Marsh, right? Yes. Now, you really should

925
02:51:35,350 --> 02:51:42,389
get the waypoint, but the only waypoint that matters is Catacombs level two. But this is

926
02:51:42,389 --> 02:51:47,190
hardcore and you can't just die. So I'm gonna just hold on. I'm gonna relax for a second.

927
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:19,180
Ooh, that's pretty good. Lightning and Poison Resist. Block rate, 35% chance to block. Oh,

928
02:52:20,139 --> 02:52:27,819
I can't really use it. When's the Paladin Scepter? I gotta use that. Wait, that's a Necromancer only

929
02:52:27,819 --> 02:52:40,229
item. No plus to skills, so it's absolutely worthless. I keep going. Is that a waypoint?

930
02:52:42,549 --> 02:52:57,129
Oh, you leveled up. Remember, there's a bug on your camera. Oh, oh, fucking ew.

931
02:52:57,690 --> 02:53:17,079
Hey, look, the waypoint. All right, outer cloister. I think it's over. Kill the bug, kill the bug,

932
02:53:17,079 --> 02:53:24,360
kill the bug. No, this bug's gonna live. You guys ever do that? You guys ever have a bug in your

933
02:53:24,360 --> 02:53:28,340
house? Like a spider or something? And it's in a spot where, you know, it's probably not gonna

934
02:53:28,340 --> 02:53:33,770
bother you. And you just go, all right, man, you can stay, you get to live. You stay there.

935
02:53:37,020 --> 02:53:43,370
You can just hang out up there, but don't do any encroachment. The further you come out with that

936
02:53:43,370 --> 02:53:49,049
web, the more chance there is that I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking get rid of it. All right, that's

937
02:53:49,610 --> 02:54:03,739
this is the lightning lightning lightning lightning. Careful. Oh, fucking people are dying.

938
02:54:04,379 --> 02:54:14,379
I'm so, oh, that's good. That's really good. Come on, plus the skills, plus the skills,

939
02:54:21,559 --> 02:54:32,120
plus two to corpse explosion, plus one to weaken. All right, but I lose my actual damage. Hold on,

940
02:54:32,120 --> 02:54:45,049
I'll look at that later. We're gonna get into the scales. I'm gonna kill people around you.

941
02:54:46,329 --> 02:55:03,049
Why am I doing such a little damage to you? All right, speaking of damage, I gotta be doing

942
02:55:03,049 --> 02:55:08,870
that way more often. Amplified damage, two to forty damage is a hell of a range. Yeah, and it is.

943
02:55:09,909 --> 02:55:18,760
It is. Portal shrine, great portal. I'll take it.

944
02:55:18,760 --> 02:55:38,409
But range damage really can kill you without, I guess, look at everybody with my true friend.

945
02:55:41,209 --> 02:55:48,360
Love the bone squad we got going on right now. The ever increasing, what I got, six people.

946
02:55:52,200 --> 02:56:02,950
I do feel a lot safer having six friends. Yeah, I can't play it online, but I can play with my

947
02:56:02,950 --> 02:56:12,680
pretend friends here. All right, monastery gate. This place has the stale demons about it.

948
02:56:15,129 --> 02:56:27,270
Sucks. I can't carry anymore. Oh, wait. All right, give her this.

949
02:56:30,040 --> 02:56:44,329
Talk it. Who cares about the man? This dude's been playing since the beta. Yeah, dude.

950
02:56:46,489 --> 02:56:49,450
This shit actually does get dangerous in here. This is like one of the first parts of the game

951
02:56:49,450 --> 02:56:56,170
that you can actually get truly, truly, truly. A lot of tiny little corridors,

952
02:56:57,049 --> 02:57:03,459
a lot of random people that just run through. Let's just stay alive. That's all it's about.

953
02:57:11,290 --> 02:57:25,909
I do have to keep reminding myself that this is hardcore. Can't just have to be careful.

954
02:57:25,909 --> 02:57:45,639
Okay, there's a demon up there. We still got all of our friends, right? Yep. All right. Move.

955
02:57:46,440 --> 02:57:55,270
Move up. Move up. Let's move. Move. Move up. Is this being revived by?

956
02:57:57,700 --> 02:58:07,000
Where is he? All right. I just was going to say, oh, thank God I got that in case I die.

957
02:58:07,639 --> 02:58:22,059
That's not how this works. Easy. Hold up. We're going to hold off on leveling up for a minute.

958
02:58:22,700 --> 02:58:29,930
I want to keep getting in. Hey, just in case I die, I'll be able to run back.

959
02:58:30,729 --> 02:58:36,889
No, you won't, because that's where the game ends.

960
02:58:39,159 --> 02:58:44,680
The butcher, too, might kill me. No, I have to get through three sacks.

961
02:58:45,799 --> 02:58:58,059
Otherwise, what the hell? Lost my mage.

962
02:59:10,409 --> 02:59:27,209
When are you going to do Sea Man 2? Is this Sea Man 2? Wait, isn't that one Japanese only?

963
02:59:28,170 --> 02:59:42,299
And then only come out in Japan? Play it out. There's no English version of it.

964
02:59:52,120 --> 02:59:57,430
You know where I really think I'm going to have a huge problem? The Arcane Sanctuary.

965
03:00:01,159 --> 03:00:11,690
That's the worst place in the whole game. If you don't play the Arcane Sanctuary with at least

966
03:00:11,690 --> 03:00:31,860
four people, life sucks. Okay, easy. The barracks. I'm just running around sniping the Shaman.

967
03:00:32,340 --> 03:00:38,459
What? What the fuck? How did I take that much damage?

968
03:00:54,090 --> 03:01:07,059
You weren't here earlier. My account is fucking damaged. I want them to go in first.

969
03:01:07,059 --> 03:01:19,049
I hate these little doors. Back up, back up, back up, back up. This is the worst,

970
03:01:19,049 --> 03:01:35,139
because you can just open a door and get hit three times and die. Are we good? 22 gold, 23 gold.

971
03:01:40,200 --> 03:01:49,110
Looking for the jail level one. Okay, back up.

972
03:01:52,860 --> 03:02:10,120
All right. Yeah, I'm starting to get a little clenched. Just a little. All it takes is one

973
03:02:10,120 --> 03:02:26,489
person. We got some, that's a lot of money. Hold on a second. I got to do something about this.

974
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:52,340
What about one guy? A lot of potions left. Sell the miners. This is such a weird build.

975
03:02:53,139 --> 03:02:59,299
I have way more potions than I need. Why are all these rejuvenation potions dropping?

976
03:02:59,299 --> 03:03:07,239
I don't remember this being a thing. It feels weird and new. Why are there so many rejuvenation

977
03:03:07,239 --> 03:03:38,579
potions? This over here. I'm going to store this. Use them for the cube. That is right. All right,

978
03:03:38,579 --> 03:03:46,170
what we got for skill points here? We've unlocked Iron Maiden. I'm just saying. We've unlocked it.

979
03:03:46,170 --> 03:03:49,530
Here are the, we have summoning spells. We still have the same amount.

980
03:03:50,409 --> 03:03:59,909
And then here's the poison bone. One point in teeth. Don't worry, it's not useless or anything.

981
03:04:00,549 --> 03:04:34,329
All right, where are we going? He's got one tooth. It's like we're staying in the summoning tree.

982
03:04:35,530 --> 03:04:48,059
Everyone's got one good can opening tooth. All right, well, what are we doing in here?

983
03:04:48,059 --> 03:04:51,659
And by the way, if you put another point into golem, it does not give you two golems.

984
03:04:51,659 --> 03:04:55,500
It just makes your one golem much better. I want to make sure everyone's aware of that.

985
03:04:56,459 --> 03:05:21,079
Germa one golem. Second skeletal mage. It's golem. I know, but ever since I was like 15

986
03:05:21,079 --> 03:05:25,959
playing this game, I just, I say golem. I know. All right, that's the thanks for voting. That's,

987
03:05:25,959 --> 03:05:41,100
there's no way anything's coming back from that. And what about stats? Is it bogus voting or am I

988
03:05:41,100 --> 03:05:48,219
unable to vote because of mobile? I don't think extensions work on mobile. I think that's probably

989
03:05:48,219 --> 03:06:06,739
what's going on. Some do. Yeah. Vitality. Still no points in decks, but that's a,

990
03:06:08,020 --> 03:06:11,860
actually that's, that's probably going to be a bad thing. It is this many points in strength already.

991
03:06:13,139 --> 03:06:22,170
Vitality. Thanks for voting. With this many points. Yeah. All right, we're going to get a

992
03:06:22,729 --> 03:06:33,639
second skeleton mage. Cool. And what was it? Vitality, right? Yeah. 26 dexterity.

993
03:06:34,440 --> 03:06:45,290
All right. Five points. If I was a barbarian or something or no, this is a terrible build,

994
03:06:45,290 --> 03:07:02,020
whoever you are. Okay. Make sure I've got everybody. One, two, three, four. So I got seven

995
03:07:02,020 --> 03:07:23,940
companions. So it's going to start to get messy very quickly. It's almost broken. All right.

996
03:07:23,940 --> 03:07:38,120
Yell up on the mini map. You see a, okay, something's in here. The only way to play hardcore

997
03:07:39,079 --> 03:07:52,219
the guy who watches. Ooh, skullcap. All of them's in there. Everyone's alive still. So this is okay.

998
03:08:01,750 --> 03:08:08,440
I want to check that skullcap. Everyone's still alive. We're fine. Let's take a look.

999
03:08:11,690 --> 03:08:18,299
Better six to energy. That's pretty useful. And lightning resist. Yeah. Put it on. It's better.

1000
03:08:19,260 --> 03:08:42,329
Straight up. All right. Stay with me. What level am I? I'm 13. Potentially a little underleveled

1001
03:08:42,329 --> 03:08:51,190
for what is happening in the next section here. But, you know, sometimes you got to go for it.

1002
03:08:52,069 --> 03:09:15,270
I know you're 13. Yeah. You have to grind. I haven't had too much of a problem yet.

1003
03:09:16,229 --> 03:09:20,889
Once, if this starts to become a problem, this is still on player's set of four.

1004
03:09:21,770 --> 03:09:26,309
Yeah, it's at least three or four. If this becomes a problem, then I will grind.

1005
03:09:26,309 --> 03:09:45,370
Is that a ring? Almost. It's playing hardcore and Diablo foolish if you've never played it before.

1006
03:09:47,020 --> 03:09:54,520
Uh, yes. It's so easy to accidentally die in these games by just some random explosion

1007
03:09:55,399 --> 03:09:58,040
or some random champion enemy that's going to be once you die.

1008
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:04,120
Okay. Speaking of kind of an insane room, uh, people are dying.

1009
03:10:06,100 --> 03:10:14,870
People are getting cream. What is, what is cream and everybody? Oh my God. People are dead.

1010
03:10:15,590 --> 03:10:27,290
Get up here. Up, up, up, back out, back up, back up. Golem's dead. No, it's not the Smith.

1011
03:10:30,790 --> 03:10:33,989
Okay. I'm sorry. I just get this shit at everybody. That was a mistake.

1012
03:10:33,989 --> 03:10:42,790
I forgot that what that did. There's something in here. What is in here? That's causing so much

1013
03:10:42,790 --> 03:10:51,850
damage. They're all down the corner. Oh, this is, oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1014
03:10:51,850 --> 03:10:59,860
This is where it ends. This is where it ends. All right. Maybe it's time to grind. There's like five

1015
03:10:59,860 --> 03:11:24,729
champions down there in the corner. I can't see everybody. Okay. Okay. This is bad. This is bad.

1016
03:11:24,729 --> 03:11:29,610
Let them come to us. All right. Just, all right, Larry, it's just me and you. I got to move. We

1017
03:11:29,610 --> 03:11:43,079
have to leave. I got to get out. Okay. Now we have to do the fun thing called be a necromancer. Uh,

1018
03:11:43,079 --> 03:11:45,559
we're going to go out to the blood more and we're going to get a full party again.

1019
03:11:46,280 --> 03:11:58,069
That's a wink. There is no wink. No, there's no, I, I can look, I can see it now. Yes, there is. No,

1020
03:11:58,069 --> 03:12:13,510
there isn't. I'm looking right now. It was a scam. I like identifying on the fly. Even it's a waste

1021
03:12:13,510 --> 03:12:34,250
of money. I know. Okay. All right. Let's, uh, get some new friends. Oh, gamble. I might in a second

1022
03:12:37,579 --> 03:12:41,750
and repair. Yep. Refilling shrine. Just do it. That almost was very bad.

1023
03:12:42,549 --> 03:12:52,620
Just give me some, I need to just build my army back up before I go back in the door for them to

1024
03:12:52,620 --> 03:13:01,940
instantly die. Is that seriously the only body that's around here? How can that be the only body?

1025
03:13:02,659 --> 03:13:23,719
There's going to be a German wink market correction soon. Probably. All right. Den of evil. I was in

1026
03:13:23,719 --> 03:13:39,670
there already. We just do two more things. Come on. Manor recharge station. Yeah, there's that. We

1027
03:13:39,750 --> 03:13:59,930
have our Golem and now we have, see one more of these. In fact, I used them. That's all right.

1028
03:14:02,260 --> 03:14:08,540
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Everything's fine. I almost had a panic attack. In fact,

1029
03:14:08,540 --> 03:14:15,690
this is better because then I can, I can, yeah, this is fine. I didn't repair. I will, I will,

1030
03:14:15,690 --> 03:14:25,129
I will. After I get through these dickheads up here, we got to go slow and I got to run in the

1031
03:14:25,129 --> 03:14:30,139
room. No, we have to have the, the Golem has to go in the room first. I ain't going in there first.

1032
03:14:41,540 --> 03:14:51,639
Where is it? The shithouse has to go in there first. There they are. All right. Get them. Get in.

1033
03:14:51,639 --> 03:14:58,969
Everybody in. Everybody get in. Kill. Holy fuck. There's still a lot of people in there.

1034
03:15:00,010 --> 03:15:09,370
We good? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

1035
03:15:10,250 --> 03:15:16,600
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Kill this guy. Good. Overwhelm them. Overwhelm.

1036
03:15:17,399 --> 03:15:42,170
Golem's doing a good job. Nice. Everyone's fine. All right. Kill him. He's pounding him right.

1037
03:15:42,729 --> 03:16:00,120
All right. Nice job. That was almost a disaster. Almost a disaster. A second time.

1038
03:16:02,649 --> 03:16:29,030
What have we got? Almost level up. Everyone's okay. We continue. Found it. Yeah. Level one.

1039
03:16:32,500 --> 03:16:44,100
Safe. The slow torture of caged starvation. Okay. I'm going to, where's, uh, is that really in such

1040
03:16:44,100 --> 03:16:57,290
a stupid place that I can't click on it? Did I really do that to myself? The order welcomes you.

1041
03:16:58,170 --> 03:17:13,340
I'm going to go gamble too. I'm not going to repair. It's a lot of money.

1042
03:17:14,139 --> 03:17:23,420
Try to get some heavy armor. Well, this chain gloves, which are probably better than what I

1043
03:17:23,420 --> 03:17:45,989
have. How much? It's too expensive. Couldn't be much worse. I'm all right. It's not terrible.

1044
03:17:46,549 --> 03:17:52,940
I have more defense now. Does he know that it's not pronounced? It's pronounced dual. It's not dual

1045
03:17:52,940 --> 03:18:03,190
weld. Yeah. I know it's wield. Dual wield. Dual weld is easier for me to say. Dual welding. Dual

1046
03:18:03,190 --> 03:18:18,680
welding. Dual welding. Dual wielding. All right. We're just going to level up. I think that's good.

1047
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:35,299
Let's go back in. I'm prepared. Dual weld. Golem. Bad. All right. Place your bets actually.

1048
03:18:36,100 --> 03:18:39,139
I want to know real opinions. Do you guys think I'm going to beat Andariel?

1049
03:18:40,340 --> 03:18:45,659
Do you think I'm going to? How do we figure this out? How do we do like an actual

1050
03:18:45,659 --> 03:19:05,719
figure this out test? Heavy gloves. There it is.

1051
03:19:17,260 --> 03:19:21,379
Are you okay? Like, hold on. I'll actually have to pause again.

1052
03:19:22,579 --> 03:19:59,989
I'm going to help him. He needs like a blanket. Hold on. He has this, uh,

1053
03:20:00,950 --> 03:20:10,069
you got a cone. We got him one of the soft cones, you know, things so he doesn't get his stitches.

1054
03:20:11,110 --> 03:20:16,280
So, but he can kind of get stuck. Then when the, when the cone, because it's a soft cone,

1055
03:20:16,840 --> 03:20:23,180
it can press down and he's like, eh, I need to help him sometimes. That was a real wink.

1056
03:20:26,149 --> 03:20:32,569
It really was. That was actually, okay. That actual, yeah, you're right. It did. You're right.

1057
03:20:32,649 --> 03:20:52,489
Here. Thanks a lot. The prophecy has been fulfilled. How are we doing? Dude, fucking,

1058
03:20:52,489 --> 03:20:54,649
I can't wait to kill Andariel first try.

1059
03:20:56,809 --> 03:21:31,959
Losing. Stay back. Too bad that's not a weapon. It's Paladin only. So I guess I could save it.

1060
03:21:31,959 --> 03:21:42,360
Hold on. Six. So many potions. Do they like up the amount of potions you can have?

1061
03:21:43,319 --> 03:21:47,979
I swear to God, the last time I played this, there wasn't this many potions available.

1062
03:21:50,440 --> 03:22:09,479
Don't keep picking those. Bring jail level two. All right. Easy. Easy. Easy.

1063
03:22:12,569 --> 03:22:25,239
Skill shrine. I might be able to get more skeletons with that. Six, four and a third. Yeah. A third.

1064
03:22:25,239 --> 03:22:42,500
Okay. Almost at the inner cloister. Almost at a major boss of the game.

1065
03:22:43,620 --> 03:23:01,000
Close there. There are so many potions because the game is trying to drop enough of the three

1066
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:13,979
players you have. You're a hacker. I guess that's true. Get antidote potions. I know. I know. I've

1067
03:23:13,979 --> 03:23:18,860
played the video game. I know Andariel's got poisoned and you have to be careful

1068
03:23:19,819 --> 03:23:22,780
because it'll kill you. That's gonna be I'm gonna be so terrified.

1069
03:23:24,139 --> 03:23:32,299
You guys want to know something about this? Here's a true story. I have never once and I truly mean

1070
03:23:32,299 --> 03:23:39,020
ever over the course of thousands and thousands and thousands of hours across Diablo one through

1071
03:23:39,020 --> 03:23:47,190
Diablo three. Thousands. Thousands of hours. I've never played one single character on hardcore.

1072
03:23:47,190 --> 03:23:55,459
This is the first time you're ever going to see this. Never taken a shower. I have never ever

1073
03:23:55,459 --> 03:24:05,079
taken a shower. Hardcore to me was always too stressful because there's so many ways to die

1074
03:24:05,079 --> 03:24:09,639
in these games that especially when you get onto a higher difficulty like nightmare of hell,

1075
03:24:09,639 --> 03:24:17,620
you can die in one one hit just from something across the room. I hated it. I hated taking showers.

1076
03:24:22,360 --> 03:24:45,020
What level am I? 14? Not bad. You guys going first. Thank god you guys selected amplify damage.

1077
03:24:45,899 --> 03:25:06,819
Come on. Get in there. Get in there. Let's go. What the hell are you doing? Dude 14? What? Are

1078
03:25:06,819 --> 03:25:31,180
you serious? Yeah. I'm dead. Am I wearing a bathing suit? Why would I be wearing a bathing suit?

1079
03:25:32,139 --> 03:26:01,370
Will somebody kill somebody over here, please? I can't even see who's over here. This thing's

1080
03:26:01,370 --> 03:26:13,370
gonna explode. I think these explode, right? Do eight players or riot? No, I'm on four right now.

1081
03:26:14,010 --> 03:26:25,479
Do you have level two? Come on. No, it's not over there. It's down here.

1082
03:26:29,299 --> 03:26:51,049
Here's 99. I mean, if I do players eight, I'll level up faster, but

1083
03:26:52,010 --> 03:27:06,860
it's too dangerous. That's way too dangerous. Level two. This game is 20 fucking years old.

1084
03:27:09,340 --> 03:27:24,440
Very old. I'm gonna get dangerous. No, no, I can't let it end like that. I'm gonna put it on eight

1085
03:27:24,440 --> 03:27:28,760
players and die. And then I'm gonna sit there and go, why did I? What's the point of that?

1086
03:27:29,879 --> 03:27:40,299
What? To make myself look cool? Attack rating 15 to 10. Yeah, that's better. Poison resist.

1087
03:27:40,860 --> 03:27:51,579
I need poison resist. The good thing about this is about this hardcore run. If this character dies,

1088
03:27:51,579 --> 03:27:56,409
you're not going to care about losing them. Yeah, that's that's pretty good way to put it.

1089
03:27:56,409 --> 03:28:03,899
That's not that's not a bad way to look at it. Don't put eight until after and aerial. Yeah.

1090
03:28:04,459 --> 03:28:08,139
Plus, I might get some really good items from an aerial. Hopefully, hopefully I get at least

1091
03:28:08,139 --> 03:28:19,260
one or two unique. That's the real goal here. When you see that first that the gold text drop.

1092
03:28:19,899 --> 03:28:25,959
Oh, it's like I wonder what that's going to be. Be careful.

1093
03:28:32,700 --> 03:28:43,530
All right. Stone skin demon. Amplify that damage. Just stay over there. Try to get a set. Well,

1094
03:28:43,530 --> 03:28:48,090
once I get the waypoint, I can do an aerial run and just try to get a couple of cool items

1095
03:28:48,090 --> 03:28:58,940
before I get killed and active. I'm still alive. All right. Hang up on

1096
03:29:06,469 --> 03:29:10,489
no. Give me some. Give me anything. Stuttered leather. Hold on.

1097
03:29:14,090 --> 03:29:16,489
No, go back and sell. Look at all this crap.

1098
03:29:30,739 --> 03:29:32,979
They had to. They did something weird with these potions.

1099
03:29:32,979 --> 03:29:50,840
They actually did patch this. This is a lot. They patched it on Otto's birthday. Oh, that's nice of

1100
03:29:50,840 --> 03:30:08,469
them. It's even in the stash. Nothing. All right. Six and six. That's fine. Jail level two. Oh,

1101
03:30:08,469 --> 03:30:15,909
OK. What happened? Good. I don't know why, but that I got the same reaction for that. That if

1102
03:30:15,909 --> 03:30:18,069
my character died in hardcore, I don't know why I thought something happened.

1103
03:30:18,069 --> 03:30:45,020
I'm going to be able to level up twice here. Probably better than pausing the game for like

1104
03:30:45,020 --> 03:30:52,840
five, 10 minutes. Hey, Vaude, Jerma is going to die soon. What's your prediction? Yeah,

1105
03:30:52,840 --> 03:30:55,159
I mean, you've got to get what you can't say. You've got to get prediction after that.

1106
03:30:56,360 --> 03:31:07,260
Right. You can't just say soon. When? Give us time. When? 15 minutes from right now.

1107
03:31:08,299 --> 03:31:13,500
So it's with three hours and 32 minutes into the stream. So in three hours and 47 minutes.

1108
03:31:14,620 --> 03:31:37,719
OK, we'll see. As long as they have an army, I might be OK. He just opened the door by himself.

1109
03:31:39,559 --> 03:31:42,440
You've got to let dad open the doors. Don't open doors for no reason.

1110
03:31:43,319 --> 03:32:00,940
I have to be in control of that. Once we get to the interclusters, I'm going to start to

1111
03:32:01,420 --> 03:32:13,860
kill. This game is actually kind of scary. Yeah, a little three. What is that? Resist fire. Sure.

1112
03:32:14,739 --> 03:32:24,379
I'll take it. It makes me take 75 percent less damage than fire. I think. Although I've never

1113
03:32:24,379 --> 03:32:30,569
really known what that does. I've been promising the green screen since November. What's the hold

1114
03:32:30,569 --> 03:32:40,250
up? Those of you that don't know, I have costochondritis, which means I can't move around that

1115
03:32:40,250 --> 03:32:49,850
much. And until I find a solution for that problem, I cannot jump around and fly around

1116
03:32:49,850 --> 03:32:52,729
and do the things that I want to do in front of that green screen. I'm I got hold on. I got to

1117
03:32:52,729 --> 03:33:05,049
apply damage on me. So it might include a few things. I might have to have surgery on a hernia

1118
03:33:05,049 --> 03:33:11,049
and I might have to get an injection of steroids. But pretty much the only way you treat it.

1119
03:33:11,770 --> 03:33:16,600
Unfortunately, this is going to be really bad. So I have to focus here.

1120
03:33:16,680 --> 03:33:31,059
Oh, don't kill me. Why can't you guys be fired? All right. So the guy that said this is going to

1121
03:33:31,059 --> 03:33:37,399
end in 12 minutes, how dare you spawn these enemies here? Go in, like physically go in the door.

1122
03:33:38,979 --> 03:34:00,920
Get in there. Somebody go in. Go inside. All right. Kill. Fight. Mage. Mage. Mage.

1123
03:34:15,479 --> 03:34:17,719
Why do you get to have amplified damage, too? It's not fair.

1124
03:34:17,879 --> 03:34:53,510
All right. Slowly, but surely get in here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Where's my goal? Oh, I need somebody.

1125
03:34:53,510 --> 03:35:03,540
I need somebody. I need somebody. I need somebody. I need somebody. Back up. Any corpses?

1126
03:35:05,690 --> 03:35:13,350
No, you got it. You got to get in there, man. You got to get in there.

1127
03:35:14,069 --> 03:35:19,819
Come with me. You got to get in here. Get in there. He's coming to us. He's coming to us.

1128
03:35:20,780 --> 03:35:32,920
Look at his health. Inside of the gate. In the gate. Get in the gate. You're just getting hit for

1129
03:35:32,920 --> 03:35:51,450
free. Thank you. At least somebody has a brain. Get in. What if he explodes? All right. I'm ready.

1130
03:35:51,450 --> 03:36:06,059
I'm ready with another golem. It's too scary to do this on my own. He just low-key called them dumb.

1131
03:36:07,020 --> 03:36:17,770
Well, yeah. He's kind of dumb. He's going to explode into cold. I know it. I'm staying all

1132
03:36:17,770 --> 03:36:33,909
the way back here. Did I low-key say it or did I just say it? Come on. One more. Hit him. Yep.

1133
03:36:33,909 --> 03:36:48,680
Okay. I knew that was going to happen. Nice work, you two. You did it. Okay. I've got to kill like

1134
03:36:48,680 --> 03:37:00,819
two more things and level up. No corpses over here. Promote that golem to iron. I probably will. Well,

1135
03:37:00,819 --> 03:37:07,299
actually, no, I won't because it's not my decision. Don't let me influence you.

1136
03:37:08,180 --> 03:37:12,180
I'm going to have two levels up here.

1137
03:37:17,940 --> 03:37:34,500
Second level up. I don't want them to... If they're ice, they explode. That's terrible because I can't

1138
03:37:34,500 --> 03:37:55,479
turn them into corpses after that. These characters ruin the purity of the bone.

1139
03:38:04,819 --> 03:38:16,840
Cool. Level up. I will. I will. I will. I'm going to put this down.

1140
03:38:16,840 --> 03:38:46,229
I just want to get to jail level three. Got everybody? Yes. Jail up here. All right. Don't

1141
03:38:46,229 --> 03:38:56,620
even fight that. That's just... That's just death. I think it might be in here.

1142
03:38:59,209 --> 03:39:23,479
I knew it was down here. Jail level three. All right. Time to level up. We've got two

1143
03:39:23,479 --> 03:39:30,059
levels up. I'm going to put 10 points in. Where should we put our 10 points? Time for you guys

1144
03:39:30,059 --> 03:39:56,940
to make a good decision here. We got 10. You're looking a bit low. I'm talking about coffee,

1145
03:39:56,940 --> 03:40:15,989
Cheetos, and what? I'm actually not sure where that is being clicked. No, no, no. That's terrible.

1146
03:40:16,709 --> 03:40:29,100
That's the worst thing I could put 10 points in right now. It actually is the worst. You need hit

1147
03:40:29,100 --> 03:40:50,219
chance. Imagine putting one point in dexterity. Get influenced. Hey, get influenced. Get influenced.

1148
03:40:50,219 --> 03:41:20,329
10, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Done. Vitality. 10 points in. What? Done. Look at that. 39%. Thanks a lot,

1149
03:41:20,329 --> 03:41:34,180
guys. Ah, I feel so much safer. All right. We have two points to put in, but we have

1150
03:41:35,139 --> 03:41:42,069
essentially some new shit to look at here. Ray Skeleton. Skeleton Mastery. Make it better

1151
03:41:42,069 --> 03:41:54,139
skeleton. Make Clay Golem a little better or make it plus 20% health. Skeletal Mage is a third

1152
03:41:54,139 --> 03:42:02,379
skeleton permanently. We don't have enough to go down yet. That one point in teeth is just so,

1153
03:42:02,379 --> 03:42:12,790
it's haunting me. Or we have, again, amplify damage. Also keep in mind putting a second

1154
03:42:12,790 --> 03:42:20,790
point in amplify damage does not make it do more. It's always 100%. It just makes the radius bigger

1155
03:42:20,790 --> 03:42:29,620
so you don't have to cast. It gives you a much huge wide area and duration. All of them. So,

1156
03:42:29,620 --> 03:42:38,940
Iron Maiden is, I believe Iron Maiden does go up. Explosion is here. Still have not picked anything

1157
03:42:38,940 --> 03:42:45,500
in this really, besides some of you just making a joke a few hours ago. And then again, take a look

1158
03:42:45,500 --> 03:42:50,899
at what you have available for summoning. All right. Where do you guys want to go?

1159
03:43:08,540 --> 03:43:20,600
Summoning looks like not a bad choice. Where would you like to go inside of that?

1160
03:43:21,639 --> 03:43:45,879
Summoning memes are so 2019. We have another point to put in, so this is the first one. What

1161
03:43:45,879 --> 03:43:49,989
about the second one? We'll take a look what it looks like afterwards. All right, here we go.

1162
03:43:50,790 --> 03:43:58,379
Skeleton Mage. Some of you want to do a better golem, which I don't disagree with you. Not a

1163
03:43:58,379 --> 03:44:03,799
bad choice. What are you going to do with the 43% of these guys? Trying to put a, well,

1164
03:44:03,799 --> 03:44:10,170
third Skeleton Mage is good too. I'm fucking into this. I'm beating Andariel first try.

1165
03:44:17,239 --> 03:44:20,040
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All

1166
03:44:20,040 --> 03:44:30,739
right. All right. Let's go. Third Skeleton Mage. We have enough. By the way, keep in mind.

1167
03:44:32,260 --> 03:44:41,340
This is going to make them stronger defense-wise, but it's not going to add another Mage. See,

1168
03:44:41,340 --> 03:44:49,579
take a look. Take a look and see what it does. Make sure you're certain of what you want to do.

1169
03:44:49,579 --> 03:45:11,979
Residence Sleeper actually making a real build. But are they though? You know what I mean? I mean,

1170
03:45:11,979 --> 03:45:18,090
it could be kind of. All right. You see, you know, you know what's available. I don't have to show

1171
03:45:18,090 --> 03:45:27,909
you again. I will very much implore you to open up a Diablo two skill calculator and go to

1172
03:45:27,909 --> 03:45:33,850
Necromancer. You can take a look on your own time, you know, so I don't know if we can,

1173
03:45:33,850 --> 03:45:40,500
you can be certain of what you want. No, no, no, no. All right. Jesus. Just give me a suggestion.

1174
03:45:40,500 --> 03:45:49,719
What the fuck? All right. Where are we going? I would do that. Why would I do that? I just click

1175
03:45:49,719 --> 03:46:32,739
on X. Okay. Summoning it is. Silence. Summoning it is. What are we doing in summoning?

1176
03:46:39,959 --> 03:46:49,530
Real build. Real build. What is this real build? I wanted to do 20 points into dim vision. Why?

1177
03:46:50,649 --> 03:47:01,719
No, he's going to kill Andariel. You had an opportunity and you didn't take it.

1178
03:47:05,500 --> 03:47:11,879
I actually completely I have to apologize to you guys. I was under the impression that you

1179
03:47:11,879 --> 03:47:18,760
were going to put one point into skeletons and then 20 points into skeleton mastery.

1180
03:47:19,719 --> 03:47:28,440
I thought you were going to do 20 points into teeth. I you know, you've got you guys are

1181
03:47:28,440 --> 03:47:39,139
actually working pretty well right now. Let's get all the mastery. I don't want to give you

1182
03:47:39,139 --> 03:47:53,610
any ideas, but we're already going on a build here. Okay. All mastery. Let's go. Which as you see,

1183
03:47:54,489 --> 03:47:59,129
life is at 100. This is an attack bonus. Take a look at the attack. It's at 20.

1184
03:47:59,850 --> 03:48:09,610
So he's at 80 and 100. Let's do a bang. So he's got 120 health. The attack is a little bit better.

1185
03:48:09,610 --> 03:48:18,700
He's just going to live a lot longer. He walks a lot faster too. You're doing cuck at build.

1186
03:48:37,879 --> 03:48:41,670
This is literally the build I did in middle school.

1187
03:48:42,469 --> 03:48:54,549
Yeah. And guess what? It's fun to look at, but you'll see when we get to a boss,

1188
03:48:55,750 --> 03:49:01,610
it's only me. Well, who knows? They may have patched it. Here we go. Jail level three. Let's

1189
03:49:01,610 --> 03:49:10,899
do it. Thanks for voting. You guys won't even give me bone armor. If I'm going to be melee

1190
03:49:12,790 --> 03:49:16,469
necromancer, like you at least give me some defense.

1191
03:49:19,290 --> 03:49:45,559
Am I running faster? What? I feel like I'm faster. Kind of a suboptimal build. I would say.

1192
03:49:45,559 --> 03:49:52,379
Yeah. It's very suboptimal, but that's just the way it is. Now we get a champion down here.

1193
03:50:10,700 --> 03:50:24,520
Getting harder to kill things. Oh, that's right. I do it. I do another mage.

1194
03:50:27,559 --> 03:50:50,899
We got eight friends. Yeah. The Golem lasted a lot longer. Golem's name should be play.

1195
03:50:52,020 --> 03:50:58,889
Yeah. Well, the thing about the Golems in this game is if you beef them up,

1196
03:50:59,450 --> 03:51:04,329
they will survive at bosses and they will. It is just, it is just you watching somebody else play

1197
03:51:04,329 --> 03:51:10,659
the game. Just hypothetical. If you put, if you guys put like 20 points into the Golem shit,

1198
03:51:11,459 --> 03:51:14,579
we're going to be watching somebody else and watch somebody play a video game.

1199
03:51:15,780 --> 03:51:29,559
I will be the camera pointing at the Golem. Come on, Drew crew. Why can't he just be dead

1200
03:51:29,559 --> 03:51:36,729
in 10 seconds? So we can play Nancy Drew. That's not, that's not going to happen.

1201
03:51:39,540 --> 03:51:43,379
If I were to die in 10 seconds, we would have played a paperclip empire,

1202
03:51:43,940 --> 03:52:09,879
but whatever that thing was called, true, true, true. If we got a new crew, look at this crew.

1203
03:52:09,879 --> 03:52:52,440
You don't like this crew skeleton crew calcium crew. Come on. Milk mob battle.

1204
03:52:53,319 --> 03:53:03,209
Let's get so hectic. You don't even know who's on your team.

1205
03:53:11,180 --> 03:53:19,020
Once there's 10 skeletons, 15 skeletons and five different, it's just hard going on.

1206
03:53:20,540 --> 03:53:33,530
I got an item. I have like good items or what? Cool items. I haven't seen one.

1207
03:53:40,139 --> 03:53:45,670
Bones are made of solidified milk. This is where I die. Game over. This is game over. I lose.

1208
03:53:46,629 --> 03:53:59,860
Holy fuck. That was terrifying. Everybody in the bones equal frozen milk.

1209
03:54:05,340 --> 03:54:09,500
Yeah. I got to buy the portal. If I'm playing on hardcore, I got to find portal to something.

1210
03:54:10,860 --> 03:54:15,909
I'll just stand there and open up the inventory. All right. That's,

1211
03:54:15,909 --> 03:54:24,229
that's a lesson I need to learn right now. All right. I'm binding, uh, F five town portal.

1212
03:54:24,790 --> 03:54:25,750
Okay. Good to know.

1213
03:54:35,770 --> 03:54:41,299
They all run at you like that. I see that Adam Sandler got snubbed for best actor. I did.

1214
03:54:42,659 --> 03:55:12,260
It's a joke. I was actually getting a little nervous. I just heard the, uh,

1215
03:55:13,059 --> 03:55:21,739
blacksmith's voice line and gotten nervous. What did he say? He said, I will crush your bones to

1216
03:55:21,739 --> 03:55:42,489
dust. Something like that. I'm scared now. Don't open. What a room. Bad room.

1217
03:55:45,620 --> 03:55:49,799
We're doing a real life. Don't get stuck in there. Don't get stuck in there. I don't know.

1218
03:55:57,620 --> 03:56:07,079
Come on. Stay alive. I'm just the coach. Just a football coach.

1219
03:56:15,430 --> 03:56:22,870
He's lightning or what? Diamond. I'll take it. It's a teleporter.

1220
03:56:22,870 --> 03:56:35,399
Okay. Old enchanted. Are you seriously going to give me Paladin shields? Why? Give me anything

1221
03:56:35,399 --> 03:57:04,489
else. It sucks. That sucks. It's okay. It's all right. Diablo two. I was just paraphrasing.

1222
03:57:05,370 --> 03:57:08,569
That wasn't actually me actually doing. It wasn't paraphrasing. Found it.

1223
03:57:10,120 --> 03:57:28,459
All right. Inner cloister. Time to get scared. I'm so glad I'm not a potion find barbarian. This

1224
03:57:28,459 --> 03:57:38,180
would not have lasted very long. This would have been horrible. It might be going a little faster

1225
03:57:38,180 --> 03:57:43,670
if I was source first or something, but even still, I think that would be horrible as well.

1226
03:57:44,549 --> 03:58:01,819
This is just stupid and shitty enough to last long enough to have fun. Thanks for that.

1227
03:58:01,819 --> 03:58:17,909
It's because you are one. I am one. What? All right. This is kind of funny.

1228
03:58:18,870 --> 03:58:24,840
This is kind of funny. I'm going to put this on screen.

1229
03:58:44,860 --> 03:58:54,139
That's fun. This stream was worth it just for that.

1230
03:58:54,940 --> 03:58:58,600
Oh, whatever. I just want to do this. I think this is fun.

1231
03:59:07,530 --> 03:59:11,620
Plus two to the artist. All right. Here we go.

1232
03:59:12,420 --> 03:59:14,979
Uh, where's the waypoint? It's like right here somewhere. Isn't it?

1233
03:59:14,979 --> 03:59:28,440
Plus two to the artist. Minus two to me. I didn't say anything. Can't you just give

1234
03:59:28,440 --> 03:59:37,850
plus two to the artist? Why do I have to get a minus? That seems kind of unfair.

1235
03:59:37,850 --> 03:59:42,469
Inner cloister. There it is. All right. Time to get scared.

1236
03:59:43,590 --> 03:59:45,989
Seriously. Actually scared because this is the part with the

1237
03:59:48,469 --> 04:00:11,450
monastery barracks. I have a lot of friends over here. Is there no max level?

1238
04:00:13,690 --> 04:00:17,930
Uh, there is no max level. Wait, is it outer cloister? Wait, where is it?

1239
04:00:21,500 --> 04:00:29,049
I didn't know it's outer cloister. Isn't it? Yeah. It's the barracks. Okay.

1240
04:00:32,700 --> 04:00:36,219
Well, I'm going to do this because I want the, I want to be able to do the thing.

1241
04:00:39,299 --> 04:00:42,520
I'm free to die. I hope not.

1242
04:00:46,040 --> 04:00:58,040
Barracks. Okay. Yeah. I wasn't here before. All right. Uh, uh, I hate this. I hate hardcore.

1243
04:00:58,040 --> 04:01:04,299
I do any one of these doors. I'm just going to hear the voice line. It's going to get

1244
04:01:04,299 --> 04:01:07,579
the shit out of me. He's going to sprint at me. He's going to hit me once. I'm going to

1245
04:01:07,579 --> 04:01:26,620
hurt us. Here it is. I'm trying to get around. All right. Golem, tank them.

1246
04:01:30,899 --> 04:01:54,040
Still alive, right? I'm so paranoid. We bring this back to, uh, Charsey.

1247
04:01:54,760 --> 04:02:01,209
Things actually pretty good. I bring it back to Charsey and then we can

1248
04:02:01,209 --> 04:02:11,899
imbue any weapon in the game as long as it's white. We can make it magic. Good to see. Oh,

1249
04:02:11,899 --> 04:02:17,420
thanks so much for returning the Herodric Malice. I will now imbue one of your items

1250
04:02:17,420 --> 04:02:24,579
with magical powers. Thank you. Well, the idea here is you do not just do this for no reason.

1251
04:02:25,459 --> 04:02:30,819
You find something that's really high quality and you bring it, but you don't just want to

1252
04:02:30,819 --> 04:02:35,540
throw one. Oh, yeah. A random pair of socks. No, no, that would be terrible. So that would be

1253
04:02:35,540 --> 04:02:44,420
waste. Almost level up. It is certain that we face the demon queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the

1254
04:02:44,420 --> 04:02:51,540
rogue sisterhood and defiled their ancestral monastery. This does not bode well for us,

1255
04:02:51,540 --> 04:02:58,250
my friend. Yep, yep, yep. Kill Andariel. Find Andariel's lair in the depths of the monastery

1256
04:02:58,250 --> 04:03:05,909
catacombs. We are there. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. Let's go.

1257
04:03:06,709 --> 04:03:16,020
I'm ready. We need to get the catacombs level two waypoint so I can farm for items if I want to.

1258
04:03:17,139 --> 04:03:23,219
Do not ever, under any circumstances, play Diablo 2 and not get the last waypoint. It would be a

1259
04:03:23,219 --> 04:03:29,059
mistake. Don't do it. I know some of you just want to run through, but we have to get that waypoint.

1260
04:03:33,379 --> 04:03:47,110
Worst mistake of my entire life. Oh my god, he's...

1261
04:03:50,309 --> 04:03:59,290
I would be so scared if I was doing this with anything else. Oh, there's a lot of people in

1262
04:03:59,290 --> 04:04:05,100
here. Slow, slow. Good thing I was... We got our first... Boys and girls, we got our first unique.

1263
04:04:05,739 --> 04:04:13,719
And a jewel. Oh, yes. Don't die. That's a unique over there. Uniques in this game are not like

1264
04:04:13,719 --> 04:04:20,899
Diablo 3. They're actually cool. It's not just like 700 strength, 700 intelligence, 750

1265
04:04:21,940 --> 04:04:36,969
health. No, they're actually cool. What is it? Oh my god. Our first fucking legendary.

1266
04:04:38,969 --> 04:04:49,510
I want to identify right now, but that's a mistake. 700 IQ glove. Player of the room,

1267
04:04:49,510 --> 04:04:54,360
don't be an idiot. Don't be a fucking idiot. No reason to put myself in danger.

1268
04:04:57,500 --> 04:05:04,299
Who's reviving? Where are you? Where's the shaman? Where's the shaman?

1269
04:05:10,709 --> 04:05:12,309
Okay, that's a champion.

1270
04:05:33,780 --> 04:05:35,139
Thank you, Coke Gaming.

1271
04:05:37,379 --> 04:05:44,739
It's so funny how that just became a thing randomly overnight. It really did. All right,

1272
04:05:44,739 --> 04:05:55,559
let's see. Heavy gloves. Pretty fucking good. Blood fist. 10% increased attack speed,

1273
04:05:56,729 --> 04:06:07,059
40 health, 10 defense, plus five to minimum damage. Let's see what this does when I put them on.

1274
04:06:07,059 --> 04:06:22,489
Look at the health. Ready? 150, 190, 30% faster hit recovery, which is huge. 40 health is huge.

1275
04:06:24,200 --> 04:06:39,780
Yep. Nice. Seems kind of bad. For a random, just normal act one, that's pretty good.

1276
04:06:45,670 --> 04:06:55,000
Big in my head. Bullshit gloves. Let's go to the catacomb.

1277
04:07:01,639 --> 04:07:11,530
You're not going to beat act two. Well, there's a way I'll beat act two. And that is I know it's

1278
04:07:11,530 --> 04:07:20,700
going to be me versus Doriel. Right? So I just have to grind until I have like 80 cold resistance.

1279
04:07:20,700 --> 04:07:28,790
It's just the only way. What about the maggot lair? Oh, man. I forgot about the maggot lair.

1280
04:07:29,510 --> 04:07:41,180
That might be the run ender. All right. Catacombs. It sucks. It's a really shitty jewel.

1281
04:07:48,149 --> 04:07:55,030
Like you're going to make it to the maggot lair. I think I'll make it to the maggot lair. I mean,

1282
04:07:55,030 --> 04:08:10,459
unless something really bad happens now. And we're going to find my screaming tomorrow. Yeah.

1283
04:08:13,180 --> 04:08:22,020
Another jewel. Doriel is going to kill 100%. I don't know. It's going to be tough.

1284
04:08:23,700 --> 04:08:42,729
This is better than what I have on. Nine to 15, one to 27. But I'm out of, I'm out of, um,

1285
04:08:42,729 --> 04:08:56,260
town portals. That's horrible. Okay. I can't go back to town. Don't they be paying attention to

1286
04:08:56,260 --> 04:09:23,860
that stuff? Stay back. I'm running dumb. If I identify that's not what I want, it's whatever

1287
04:09:23,860 --> 04:09:41,690
it means they're going to drop. Come on, scroll. Scroll the town portal. I can't be a rat man.

1288
04:09:50,549 --> 04:10:20,920
Are they alive? How am I overburdened? Oh, all right. Is this better? If I put, all right,

1289
04:10:21,559 --> 04:10:26,040
if I just put a bunch of dumb shit in here, three to four fire damage, can I make this better?

1290
04:10:26,840 --> 04:10:53,350
15, 16, 18. Fire resist and cast. No. Does Darryl have fire? No, it's poison. Is it poison and fire?

1291
04:10:54,069 --> 04:11:20,409
It might be. Town portal. There it is. Yes, poison. Okay. It sells junk. Junk, junk, junk, junk, junk.

1292
04:11:21,129 --> 04:11:26,020
This shit is junk too. Yeah. It's taking up too much space. Get the hell out of here.

1293
04:11:26,020 --> 04:11:41,639
It really is. It's taking up too much space. This guy's a psycho. What did I do? This guy's a psycho.

1294
04:11:46,440 --> 04:12:01,159
14,000. Should I gamble? Maybe. Yeah, we'll level up. I'm going to need to do it every time.

1295
04:12:02,280 --> 04:12:23,750
All right. I need, I'm looking for, I need armor. All right. What's the worst thing I possibly,

1296
04:12:23,750 --> 04:12:34,149
what's the worst thing I have on me? These boots suck. Three. This belt sucks. Everything kind of

1297
04:12:34,149 --> 04:12:43,610
sucks. The boots are probably the worst though. What do you need? I don't need gloves anymore for

1298
04:12:43,610 --> 04:13:15,319
a while. Claymore. Boots. Boots. Geed, come on. Better belt. It's going to be another slot.

1299
04:13:15,959 --> 04:13:39,500
Where are the boots? Anything. Geed, come on. Here we go. Heavy boots. They're still awful.

1300
04:13:40,139 --> 04:13:48,649
Why level four of all the things? I'm so focused on this game. You won't notice. Yes, I do.

1301
04:13:57,379 --> 04:14:13,110
All right. Chain boots. Bad. I can do this like one more time. I don't want to completely

1302
04:14:13,110 --> 04:14:34,280
broke our chain boots. Come on. Rare. Well, that didn't work out. Here are the points at this point.

1303
04:14:35,079 --> 04:14:59,270
Where am I putting these stats? Take a look. Okay, here we go. What does dexterity do? It makes you

1304
04:14:59,270 --> 04:15:06,149
hit more. It increases your attack rating and technically your defense, but it makes it so

1305
04:15:06,149 --> 04:15:15,059
you hit more. Your hit percent chance goes up. Did you die and restart? Why are your stats so bad?

1306
04:15:16,020 --> 04:15:40,739
It's not a question for me. Okay, we're doing dexterity. See, defense. Average chance that

1307
04:15:40,739 --> 04:15:46,659
Dark Shaman will hit you 40%. When this goes up again, it's not going to go up again, is it?

1308
04:15:47,620 --> 04:15:54,040
90. Still at 40%. So bad. Only 27 mana. I have 80 mana, but if...

1309
04:15:55,639 --> 04:16:09,659
It's chance your hit and chance to hit things. All right. When's the next level of... 18 isn't

1310
04:16:09,659 --> 04:16:20,340
going to get more stuff. So at 18, Blood Golem will make an appearance. You do skeleton mastery, which

1311
04:16:20,340 --> 04:16:28,229
will... Skeleton life, damage, improve missile damage. It essentially just makes everybody better.

1312
04:16:31,590 --> 04:16:42,780
More health on Golem. Attack bonus gets to 40%. Health goes up by a lot because this is synergizing,

1313
04:16:42,780 --> 04:16:56,010
obviously, with mastery. They're not quite have... Not enough to do another mage and not another melee.

1314
04:16:56,569 --> 04:17:06,969
Eventually though, maybe. Make the skeletons better. Point anywhere here. Absorbs 20 damage.

1315
04:17:07,690 --> 04:17:16,280
As you see, that's pretty useful, but you haven't put one point in it yet. So, like, thanks. Or a

1316
04:17:16,280 --> 04:17:34,299
curse. And you've seen this already before. Dimvision, Iron Maiden. Choose wisely the category

1317
04:17:34,299 --> 04:18:04,389
you'd like to put a point into. Poison Dagger is the meta. It's not your choice. It's your

1318
04:18:04,389 --> 04:18:15,340
choice collectively. He wants bad choices to make it more interesting. How does giving me a shield

1319
04:18:15,340 --> 04:18:20,940
that absorbs a bunch of health, a bunch of damage, me trying to meme you guys? I'm trying to live.

1320
04:18:22,059 --> 04:18:51,620
I want to see the end of Act 1. All right. Summoning skill. No, we're not choosing categories

1321
04:18:51,620 --> 04:19:02,260
anymore. If he dies in Act 1, we get a 10 minute mountain stream. Yes, that is still on the table.

1322
04:19:03,139 --> 04:19:31,620
Skeleton Mastery. To be put to level 3, which will increase the life 24 through missile damage.

1323
04:19:32,809 --> 04:19:41,290
Yeah, I mean, hey, let's see. 6 to 7. And there doesn't say how much damage they do, but 6 to 7

1324
04:19:41,290 --> 04:19:51,219
with health at 168. So let's see. 8 to 10 now and 76 health. Better defense. They just better out

1325
04:19:51,219 --> 04:20:09,530
all around. Okay. Have what I need, right? I just want to say you betrayed the Drew crew. I'm gonna

1326
04:20:09,530 --> 04:20:36,790
be honest. Well, we're, we're milk mob now. Sorry. I do feel a little stronger.

1327
04:20:41,719 --> 04:20:57,989
I think they're a little stronger. I got everybody, right? So fucking mad. I'm so fucking mad. I'm so

1328
04:20:57,989 --> 04:21:10,069
fucking mad. I'm so fucking mad. I'm so fucking bad. I don't know what to tell you. Drew crew

1329
04:21:10,069 --> 04:21:16,389
have their time and they continue to have time. But it's not just only about the Drew crew. It's

1330
04:21:16,389 --> 04:21:23,610
about other crews making an appearance, being able to have fun.

1331
04:21:26,010 --> 04:21:50,389
Watch out for that explosion. It's gonna happen. Kill it. Oh, oh, crystal sword. All right. That's

1332
04:21:50,389 --> 04:22:13,540
better. 7 to 24. 1 to 2. Take a look at that. All right. I get corpse explosion now, at least

1333
04:22:13,540 --> 04:22:39,510
temporarily. 20 to 44 damage. I'm good with that. And let's get corpse explosion on. I don't know.

1334
04:22:39,510 --> 04:22:49,000
Let's say I'm not cute. I got to redo this bar. I'm going to get F1 is going to be skeleton.

1335
04:22:49,799 --> 04:23:05,079
No, no, no. F1 is no. F1 amplify. F2 corpse explosion. F3 weaken. No. Yeah. And then F4,

1336
04:23:05,079 --> 04:23:17,299
F5, F6. So these are my offense moves. And then here my, yeah. So F4, F5, F6. I can also scroll

1337
04:23:17,299 --> 04:23:29,989
too, but it kind of is hard to do. Miss things very easily. All right. Now I have corpse

1338
04:23:29,989 --> 04:23:37,540
explosion so I can do this. This just became possible to beat this. As long as I never take

1339
04:23:37,540 --> 04:24:00,180
this weapon off. Find portal again. Shit. Right. Okay. F7. Please, Jeremiah, please. Bind your

1340
04:24:00,180 --> 04:24:20,180
portal. Level two. Where is it? I feel like I'm missing somebody. Am I? No. There have been

1341
04:24:20,180 --> 04:24:47,370
exactly 5,200 people here for the last hour. That's kind of crazy jerk. That's a dagger. Yep.

1342
04:24:47,930 --> 04:24:51,209
But I can't do corpse explosion that much because I don't want to lose bodies

1343
04:24:53,829 --> 04:25:09,340
for somebody. It's tricky. Not up in the top right corner. I mean, it's probably going to be lower

1344
04:25:09,340 --> 04:25:30,389
left. That's where I think it is. Easy. I like the sword. It adds to my attack rating pretty well.

1345
04:25:34,950 --> 04:25:46,219
Let's try. Almost. There's a little too. Do not let me leave here without the waypoint.

1346
04:25:46,940 --> 04:25:51,659
If you see me go down. Oh, we're going to go. No, I have to get the waypoint.

1347
04:25:52,379 --> 04:26:09,399
This is a waste of time. Corpse explosion is a broken skill. Yes, it is. Yes. Nice volume.

1348
04:26:20,549 --> 04:26:32,709
It is pretty good. You turn up my volume, please. Yeah. Sorry about that. I'll be over in five

1349
04:26:32,709 --> 04:26:56,100
minutes. I know you don't want to get out of bed. You want anything else? This way.

1350
04:27:05,530 --> 04:27:18,780
Never seen this build on forums before. Look at that. Look at how good it is. Overuse it.

1351
04:27:29,979 --> 04:27:46,250
Unlimited power. Who says that? Who says it? I just want to know if you know who says that.

1352
04:27:46,250 --> 04:28:03,979
Oh, if my game were to crash right now, would it? It's not like I lagged and I died, right?

1353
04:28:05,180 --> 04:28:17,750
It would just save the game where I am. I think so.

1354
04:28:30,260 --> 04:28:47,219
Not bad. I'm going to push this up. I think build, man. Stop teasing me.

1355
04:28:48,020 --> 04:29:14,069
I'm going to come in handy here. Don't waste it.

1356
04:29:16,870 --> 04:29:33,000
Shit, this crap is everywhere, dude. How long have I been screaming now? Four hours? Four and a half

1357
04:29:33,000 --> 04:29:57,430
hours? Something like that? Come on, waypoint. Bro, please. Flare Act 1 already. I knew somebody

1358
04:29:57,430 --> 04:30:02,629
was going to say that. I knew it when I said, oh, you know, four and a half hours. I was waiting

1359
04:30:02,629 --> 04:30:08,950
for the four and a half hours and you still want to kill Dario. Look at me. Get with the program.

1360
04:30:23,020 --> 04:30:30,389
Dude, get through Act 1 already. What the fuck, man? You're really starting to piss me off.

1361
04:30:31,270 --> 04:30:54,549
Sorry. I am a good level, though. 16? 16? You really want to be somewhere around level 20 for

1362
04:30:54,549 --> 04:31:12,010
Act 2. Like 15 to 20 is where you want to be. Usually. I hate these spiders.

1363
04:31:13,129 --> 04:31:19,299
I've got to kill this motherfucker down here. OK, no, no, no, no, no. Run, run, run, run away.

1364
04:31:19,299 --> 04:31:35,110
There's a lot of people there. This is my first time playing Diablo 2. Yeah, I know.

1365
04:31:36,920 --> 04:31:47,930
I'm just trying to get a feel for it. Where is this waypoint?

1366
04:31:48,729 --> 04:32:10,629
We're going to do Diablo 3. No, no, I don't want to play D3. Careful. Three SOJs in chat.

1367
04:32:13,979 --> 04:32:22,379
Stones of Jordan were, it really was crazy how that was just the currency of the game.

1368
04:32:22,940 --> 04:32:29,590
I told you guys that I got scammed out of a pre-patch worm skull before, right?

1369
04:32:40,340 --> 04:32:53,239
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got scammed. Yeah, because I don't know. I was an idiot.

1370
04:32:54,120 --> 04:33:06,700
Is he dead? How strong is this thing? Is Diablo 2 worth paying $20 for? Well,

1371
04:33:06,700 --> 04:33:11,159
he missed the first part of the stream. Instead of a lot of bad things.

1372
04:33:13,000 --> 04:33:31,689
Level up. We cannot kill this. I'm afraid to go in there. Kill that thing right there.

1373
04:33:31,689 --> 04:33:38,040
Things lightning chanted. I will die if I go in here. Kill it. Come on. I know you can.

1374
04:33:38,040 --> 04:33:42,060
Get a couple more people in there. Get in there. All right, easy.

1375
04:33:42,779 --> 04:34:08,659
I can't cast. Here we go. I can't go in here. Oh, it's too bad if I do. You're in such a shitty

1376
04:34:08,659 --> 04:34:19,180
spot. Come out of that spot. No, don't just go in. What are you, dumb? There's no corpses?

1377
04:34:19,180 --> 04:34:26,900
I'll be back. Stay there. Stay there. How much health does he have? Let's get too much health.

1378
04:34:26,900 --> 04:34:47,959
All right. We have to kill some stuff. Run. I found it. But I can't leave. I'm so useless without

1379
04:34:47,959 --> 04:34:57,830
the army. Oh, there he is. He's already got his health back. Oh, you've got to be fucking

1380
04:34:57,830 --> 04:35:09,430
kidding me. He regens. How am I going to kill this? Shoot teeth at him? No, that's the best

1381
04:35:09,430 --> 04:35:29,639
way to do it. I want to go in there and just smash him. Just wait it out. Look at, he's

1382
04:35:29,639 --> 04:35:33,240
regening more faster than I can kill. He's regening faster than I can kill him.

1383
04:35:34,360 --> 04:36:01,669
Try to pull out the teeth. I'm going teeth. Let's do it. Not ideal. Not ideal. I have to,

1384
04:36:01,750 --> 04:36:09,849
how much am I lighting at? 10. No, it's dead. I'm going to die. What do I do? Did I hit him

1385
04:36:09,849 --> 04:36:14,169
once? No, that's death. See, look at the one little of those bolts. No, no, no. This is

1386
04:36:14,169 --> 04:36:17,990
hardcore, guys. You can't make a stupid mistake like that. He's going to follow us around,

1387
04:36:17,990 --> 04:36:32,250
but that's fine. I'm going to get an army. No bodies anywhere. No bodies. We have to find one.

1388
04:36:38,819 --> 04:36:46,580
There. You can't wait to see this boomer is going to get owned. That's what you think,

1389
04:36:47,459 --> 04:36:50,630
but it's probably not going to happen. I'm going to be very careful.

1390
04:36:51,590 --> 04:36:54,869
I know how dangerous this is. I'm going to be very, very, very careful.

1391
04:36:57,860 --> 04:37:18,619
Okay. On the way point. We're fine. I need to kill this spider. All right. This is enough.

1392
04:37:19,259 --> 04:37:34,569
This is enough. Let's go. Come on, boys. Where are you at? Where are you at? You're hanging out

1393
04:37:34,569 --> 04:38:10,360
over here somewhere. Where is he? In here? Get him. Get him. Get him. God damn it. Come on.

1394
04:38:11,750 --> 04:38:19,080
He's melting. My golem. Every time. Kill. Holy shit. I thought the game crashed and I was about

1395
04:38:19,080 --> 04:38:35,049
to scream. Don't let him run. Kill him. He's almost dead. Well, that wasn't worth it. Oh, well.

1396
04:38:35,689 --> 04:38:50,040
Give me a skeleton. How many times this German says, get him. This stream. Oh, probably a lot.

1397
04:38:51,270 --> 04:39:01,990
Get him. Get him, guys. Get him. Get him. Get him. Yeah. All right. Let's get lucky and find

1398
04:39:01,990 --> 04:39:09,049
level four immediately and then fight the major boss of the video game. I need more. Easy. Easy.

1399
04:39:09,049 --> 04:39:16,229
Don't go. Don't just go on running in. This is bad. This is bad. Get him. This is bad. Get him.

1400
04:39:17,189 --> 04:39:28,279
Get him, guys. This is bad. Get him. I don't feel safe without a full crew.

1401
04:39:28,279 --> 04:39:44,340
And why would I? It's the only thing that this point's in. God damn it. How about over here?

1402
04:39:44,979 --> 04:40:13,180
Up left. Get him and resurrect him. Shattering these guys alive because one of these magicians

1403
04:40:13,180 --> 04:40:30,009
has the free. Kill it. Don't blow it up. Good. All right. Now I need two more mages. Undead,

1404
04:40:30,009 --> 04:41:07,939
extra strong. Don't let him turn around. Kill it. Get it. Kill it. Get it. Kill it. Well, team,

1405
04:41:07,939 --> 04:41:15,740
back to being confident again. Feel good. It's like a zit on my face. It's coming up.

1406
04:41:15,740 --> 04:41:20,299
Where did that come from? You know when your face is normal and then 10 minutes later,

1407
04:41:20,299 --> 04:41:39,610
there's just a zit on your face. Why does that happen? I hate that. Nothing in here.

1408
04:41:40,650 --> 04:41:48,139
Where is level four? That's stress. Yeah, probably.

1409
04:41:50,939 --> 04:41:56,779
Superior studded leather. We can turn that into something if I really want to.

1410
04:41:57,740 --> 04:42:01,259
Do I want to? I don't know. Should I put, should I imbue that?

1411
04:42:05,819 --> 04:42:08,939
No? You don't think so? I know I can come back here and do it.

1412
04:42:12,650 --> 04:42:18,380
I think I don't have to fight anything.

1413
04:42:28,919 --> 04:43:01,459
Oh, I can give that to Kyle. Oh, lots of money. I don't like how they're dying. They're dying

1414
04:43:01,459 --> 04:43:16,279
to regular enemies, which I don't like. I really don't like that at all. Level up. I will. Before

1415
04:43:16,279 --> 04:43:25,560
we fight Andariel. Don't worry. I just want to get there first. I'm so sorry. I just punched

1416
04:43:25,560 --> 04:43:38,009
in the face. Oh, let's go up this way. Level up. Re-level up. Re. These guys suck.

1417
04:44:00,439 --> 04:44:03,479
I've explored the entire left side and you tell me it's not over here.

1418
04:44:04,279 --> 04:44:30,700
What did I say? Blizzard sucks. The first like 30 minutes of this stream. Anger. It's true though.

1419
04:44:33,580 --> 04:44:43,400
I think Coolz will show. Please. I just want to do it. It's taken me five hours to kill Andariel.

1420
04:44:44,040 --> 04:44:51,959
Come on. I can't have it cross five hours. I know we've spent like 40 minutes picking abilities.

1421
04:44:52,680 --> 04:45:08,580
Come on. It's right here. And then we're going to make a safe point. Everyone's alive. There it is.

1422
04:45:09,139 --> 04:45:25,930
Catacombs level four. Kill Andariel. Oh, thank God. Okay. Easy. Tricky room.

1423
04:45:25,930 --> 04:45:32,919
Tricky room. Tricky room. Tricky room. I'm scared. I hate hardcore. I don't like hardcore. It's too

1424
04:45:32,919 --> 04:45:59,770
stressful. Okay. I got to go in here with a full team. All right. I got to hold enchanted. I got

1425
04:45:59,770 --> 04:46:14,360
to run up before he does anything. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. How? What? Oh, right. All

1426
04:46:14,360 --> 04:46:26,090
right. Go back to time. We're going to get the archer with the bow. Hold on. Isn't she like level

1427
04:46:26,090 --> 04:46:44,090
three? Well, that was a stupid thing to do. You can die instantly. Level seven. I've been leveling

1428
04:46:44,090 --> 04:46:56,619
Kyle. Why would I? I want the act three companion. Should I imbue this? It's hardcore.

1429
04:46:58,139 --> 04:47:02,459
You know what I'm saying? It's hardcore. I got to take the opportunity. Superior studded leather.

1430
04:47:02,459 --> 04:47:06,729
Just imbue it and make it a rare. I can't just hold on to it. What if I die?

1431
04:47:09,750 --> 04:47:18,919
Save it? There's better armor at Charsey. Is there a new loser? Jesus Christ.

1432
04:47:22,439 --> 04:47:30,310
Okay. Right. Get rid of the Dirk.

1433
04:47:30,310 --> 04:47:52,360
He dies. He dies. Yep. It all build it up to this moment. I need antidote potions.

1434
04:47:53,720 --> 04:48:17,689
Okay. How much are they? They're expensive. It might be overkill, but it's not. Trust me.

1435
04:48:18,729 --> 04:48:56,650
We're going to be such a coward. What am I doing? Is stack when you drink. What are you talking about?

1436
04:48:56,650 --> 04:49:08,389
You really don't need to do this. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. If I get poisoned, I'm going to die.

1437
04:49:09,029 --> 04:49:15,419
So I have to instantly just take it off and I'm going to make the portal in a place where I can

1438
04:49:15,419 --> 04:49:26,500
just run the fuck away. You can't die from poison. No, but I can die from a swing to my head.

1439
04:49:27,540 --> 04:49:46,950
That's a coward strat. This is hardcore, man. All right. Gamble. I want at least studded leather.

1440
04:49:46,950 --> 04:50:11,240
This is hardcore and I'm alone. I have my pretend friends here. You don't have to be. No,

1441
04:50:11,319 --> 04:50:18,200
I mean for today, I do because I was shadow banned from battle net. I have to make a new

1442
04:50:18,200 --> 04:50:28,020
account and buy the game again. We've went over this. All right. So studded leather. No,

1443
04:50:28,020 --> 04:50:38,180
I'm not going to buy this from Charsey. You can't rely on multiplayer. No, I can't.

1444
04:50:38,979 --> 04:50:49,959
I got to accomplish it. Got to achieve it on my own. Studded leather. Come on. Let's see it.

1445
04:50:50,840 --> 04:51:33,430
Ooh. Ooh. Come on. All right. What am I putting points into? That's what we got so far. 50

1446
04:51:33,430 --> 04:52:05,689
vitality, 48 strength, 32 dexterity, 36 energy. You get banned for a 20 year old game. Did he die

1447
04:52:05,689 --> 04:52:18,779
once? If I die once, the character's gone. Did you use map hacks? No. The only thing I've ever used

1448
04:52:18,779 --> 04:52:35,130
was the Glide wrapper. Is that illegal? I don't know. What are we doing though? Wait, it is.

1449
04:52:37,500 --> 04:52:44,580
Wait, the Glide wrapper is illegal. And that's why I got banned. It's just to make it so you

1450
04:52:44,580 --> 04:52:57,400
can see the 3D shit. No, is that you for real? I don't believe that for a second.

1451
04:52:58,360 --> 04:53:15,029
All right, we're doing vitality. All the Glide wrapper does is just make it so you can

1452
04:53:15,029 --> 04:53:29,720
actually see the X in the 3D stuff and everything, right? That was so disappointing when I saw that

1453
04:53:29,720 --> 04:53:36,680
though. All right, let's do skill. Let's take a look. Again, here we are. So you can see

1454
04:53:39,750 --> 04:53:51,580
these are fake just to make sure you understand they're fake. Next level, we open up some stuff

1455
04:53:51,580 --> 04:54:01,099
down here. Now it looks like we can... I don't know. It's up to you. Poison dagger, bone armor.

1456
04:54:01,740 --> 04:54:24,729
We still have iron maiden. Weaken. Up to you. Pick the category. Hold on. It screwed up.

1457
04:54:26,169 --> 04:54:37,110
Blizzard fucking sucks. All right, you know when you say something you know you're like,

1458
04:54:37,110 --> 04:54:43,990
I probably just don't say it. Who cares? Me angrily saying Blizzard sucks four hours ago is like,

1459
04:54:44,549 --> 04:55:02,810
oh well. Whatever. Oh well. Oh well. They're a 40 streamer without sponsors.

1460
04:55:03,770 --> 04:55:11,110
I don't think I'm going to get invited to the next Overwatch mixer. No. Uh oh.

1461
04:55:26,330 --> 04:55:36,459
Okay, poison and bone. Cool. What do you want? Pick something good.

1462
04:55:37,419 --> 04:55:48,819
You pick teeth right now. Why would you pick teeth right now?

1463
04:55:49,779 --> 04:55:52,740
Are you trying to fucking kill me? Yes, but don't answer that.

1464
04:55:58,069 --> 04:56:05,029
Yeah, you're giving me bone armor. Good. Good. That's just 20 extra health permanently.

1465
04:56:07,740 --> 04:56:21,099
Nice job. Thank you. Thank you so much guys. I'm going to show you some of the other category

1466
04:56:21,099 --> 04:56:23,659
stuff down here just so people that don't know what the hell is going on they can

1467
04:56:24,380 --> 04:56:31,770
make a more informed decision. So bone armor receives plus 15 absorption

1468
04:56:32,409 --> 04:56:39,659
from bone wall and bone prison. Here's bone wall. Bone wall just makes a gigantic annoying wall

1469
04:56:40,779 --> 04:56:53,880
of bone. It's a way to block stuff off. One and one. And then bone prison can hold anything.

1470
04:56:53,880 --> 04:57:11,159
Creates a barrier of fossilized bone around your target so it just traps them. Bone wall is great

1471
04:57:11,159 --> 04:57:18,340
in the maggot layer. It can help a lot. But watch, look at how cool this is.

1472
04:57:21,290 --> 04:57:24,729
Now that just stays on forever until it comes off. I'm gonna make it f8.

1473
04:57:29,419 --> 04:57:32,619
All right, no more fucking around. No more dicking around. Let's see if I can kill the

1474
04:57:32,619 --> 04:57:41,159
first boss in the game with what you guys have presented. All right.

1475
04:57:55,209 --> 04:58:15,750
Get rid of the shamans. Don't get too overwhelmed. Look at that bone armor. It's helping so much.

1476
04:58:16,549 --> 04:58:26,389
I feel safe. Okay. All right. Let's go. Not yet. Not yet. No. Hold on. I want to make sure I've

1477
04:58:26,389 --> 04:58:34,409
never- I want to make sure I'm in full health. We're good? Okay. I think we're good. Here we go.

1478
04:58:34,409 --> 04:58:42,810
I'm actually kind of nervous. I've never done this before. Everyone, have you poured a two

1479
04:58:42,810 --> 04:58:55,779
liter in your friends humidifier? What the fuck are you talking about? I didn't do that.

1480
04:58:56,500 --> 04:59:06,840
Uh, interesting though. I wonder, is it in a humidifier? A two liter of what? Of like sprite?

1481
04:59:07,400 --> 04:59:19,159
What would happen if you did that? That's so stupid. I just took damage because of that.

1482
04:59:19,159 --> 04:59:26,549
All right. Let's go. Here we go. On Dariel. No more, no more sitting around. Let's go.

1483
04:59:27,430 --> 04:59:48,220
Everybody in. This is shamans. Holder yet. That's good. Any more shamans over this way?

1484
04:59:49,529 --> 05:00:01,860
Kill that shaman right there. Oh God. I was dead. Everybody's dead. Everybody's dead. Everybody's

1485
05:00:01,860 --> 05:00:17,529
dead. Everybody's dead. Run. Run, run, run, run, run. Back to town. Greetings. You didn't even use

1486
05:00:17,529 --> 05:00:24,680
an antidote? No, man. I don't want to get killed. I don't want to take one punch and die. It's- I

1487
05:00:24,680 --> 05:00:45,939
need- Okay. We need corpses. Everybody stand still. Stay, stay, stay. Okay. Where is she?

1488
05:00:45,939 --> 05:00:51,880
All right. Everybody get- Pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it. Pull her in here. All right. Get her,

1489
05:00:51,880 --> 05:01:22,069
get her. What's going on? She instantly killed everybody. Get me out of here. Get me out of here.

1490
05:01:30,650 --> 05:01:42,819
Okay. I'm fine. Let's refill the potions. All right. Somebody just wrote

1491
05:01:45,220 --> 05:01:53,049
Hey. Fuck. It's all right. It's okay. All right. All right. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1492
05:01:53,049 --> 05:01:57,450
no, no, no, no. We're not doing that. I'm going in with a full army. I'm not going to get killed.

1493
05:01:58,490 --> 05:02:07,259
Let's just go to the dark woods and get people. I'm not going in with just my clay buddy. That

1494
05:02:07,259 --> 05:02:25,669
would be absolute death. Just do not use a town portal under any circumstances. I need bodies.

1495
05:02:26,229 --> 05:02:34,630
It's just me and you. I can't wait to see what items we get. I'm so excited,

1496
05:02:35,590 --> 05:02:46,490
but nervous at the same time. Let's go get blood vials. Oh, stamina shrine.

1497
05:02:49,220 --> 05:02:51,459
You guys just kill. I'm not going to hit anything. I don't want to break it.

1498
05:02:54,939 --> 05:03:03,319
Don't use a town portal. I'm being an idiot. Same deal. Then I'm going to swarm her.

1499
05:03:04,599 --> 05:03:22,779
I'm going to go for it again. All right. Let's go. Follow me. You got the throwback. You ate a

1500
05:03:22,779 --> 05:03:26,700
bunch of Oreos and threw up in your mother's bed. I drank a bunch of... I drank a bunch and

1501
05:03:26,700 --> 05:03:38,150
puked in a friend's bed with brothers. I don't think that's the same story. I don't think those

1502
05:03:38,150 --> 05:03:45,750
two things are connected. All right. Give me some mana potions. No, I don't need them. All right.

1503
05:03:45,750 --> 05:03:55,130
Good. All right. Here we go. Back in. I have... I still have town portal. Oh, fucking God damn it.

1504
05:03:55,130 --> 05:04:08,169
Why? It's so... All right. Here we go. One, two, three. Get in.

1505
05:04:32,060 --> 05:04:37,180
Okay. Wait. She's almost dead. She's almost dead. She's almost dead. I'm fine. I don't... Am I?

1506
05:04:38,380 --> 05:04:52,709
I've never done this before. I don't know what... Save. Fuck around.

1507
05:05:01,209 --> 05:05:33,130
She's hitting me. She's hitting me. Yeah. I did it. Wait. Kane will do this for free.

1508
05:05:33,689 --> 05:05:43,209
This is a great victory indeed. Loot the chamber? Yeah, I will.

1509
05:05:43,209 --> 05:05:47,770
Many more battles await. I will accompany you on your journey.

1510
05:05:47,770 --> 05:05:53,700
Finally. You know what assistance I can. Remember, Diablo is still out there,

1511
05:05:54,419 --> 05:06:02,250
seeking something in the desert. On your way to loot Golane. And Dario's death brings about

1512
05:06:02,250 --> 05:06:14,040
renewed life for us all. Yes. Now we talk to Warif, but not yet. Finally, we may rejoice.

1513
05:06:14,759 --> 05:06:22,540
We were dead. We can never repay. In time, we're able to rebuild our order. Skipping quests.

1514
05:06:22,860 --> 05:06:31,930
He must just be watching a video.

1515
05:06:33,849 --> 05:06:35,529
What can I do for you?

1516
05:06:35,529 --> 05:06:37,770
All right. Let's get these identified and see if there's anything worth using.

1517
05:06:41,909 --> 05:06:55,860
6 to 23. No. So there's only... No. 9 to 22. No. No.

1518
05:07:06,119 --> 05:07:17,900
Got a regular ruby. That's pretty good. All that shitty items. Well,

1519
05:07:19,799 --> 05:07:33,939
uh, not necessarily because, I mean, I guess I could, uh, I might just do it again.

1520
05:07:34,900 --> 05:07:59,080
I might just kill on Dario again. What you need. At least you got a normal ruby. That actually

1521
05:07:59,080 --> 05:08:04,119
will come in handy. If I get a weapon with a socket, that's just 20 plus extra damage.

1522
05:08:05,080 --> 05:08:20,810
That's pretty great, actually. Is that better? No. All right, let's go to Act 2.

1523
05:08:20,810 --> 05:08:23,770
The caravan is prepared. Good evening.

1524
05:08:23,770 --> 05:08:38,470
Shall we? Oh, hey, you want to watch a cut scene? I didn't lose the chamber. Oh, sorry.

1525
05:08:38,470 --> 05:08:45,590
We traveled east over the mountains and into the vast deserts of broken lands. Sorry.

1526
05:08:46,709 --> 05:08:54,549
As the days passed, my companion told me of himself that he had once been a great warrior

1527
05:08:55,509 --> 05:09:06,470
and that a dark and secret burden gnawed heavily upon him. We traveled for an eternity

1528
05:09:06,470 --> 05:09:18,310
across that arid wasteland. How long, I couldn't say. And oh, a dark cloud seemed to follow us

1529
05:09:18,869 --> 05:09:24,549
just over the horizon. Yeah, the cut scene still goes on. Finally, the journey ended. We climbed

1530
05:09:24,549 --> 05:09:46,680
the last bridge. The shining jewel sea beyond. We made camp that last night. It looks like

1531
05:09:46,680 --> 05:09:53,799
Kenshi. Perhaps it was the warm desert wind or the sound of the ocean, but for the first time

1532
05:09:53,799 --> 05:10:03,000
in many weeks, I slept. However, the dreams returned, but these were clearly not my own.

1533
05:10:03,080 --> 05:10:11,049
I beheld the vision of a great man, the mage. You were there too, Tyrael. I remember

1534
05:10:11,689 --> 05:10:20,250
seeing you in my dream. His brethren had cornered a great demon in Baal, the lord of destruction,

1535
05:10:20,250 --> 05:10:28,490
had been set loose upon the world. They attempted to imprison the demon within a sacred stone.

1536
05:10:29,049 --> 05:10:40,470
Yet when the rinse failed, Tal Rasha selflessly volunteered to contain the demon within himself,

1537
05:10:41,189 --> 05:10:52,299
completing the prison. He instructed his brethren to bind him with soul within.

1538
05:10:52,299 --> 05:11:06,380
How long is this? This is pretty long. I'm not even sure why we're watching this.

1539
05:11:08,540 --> 05:11:14,200
This is my brother. Sleep now. We set out with the dawn.

1540
05:11:20,409 --> 05:11:23,529
The next morning, we walked over the hill toward

1541
05:11:24,090 --> 05:11:40,229
Lutgulain. I had no idea then of the horrors that were in store for me there. Greetings, honored

1542
05:11:40,229 --> 05:11:47,430
traveler. I am Jeren, lord of Lutgulain, and I bid you welcome to my fair port city. I'm glad to

1543
05:11:47,430 --> 05:11:52,310
know that once again caravans are free to travel through the western pass. We've been having some

1544
05:11:52,310 --> 05:12:02,299
problems though. We're here, Akdu. It all began when a dark wanderer came this way,

1545
05:12:02,299 --> 05:12:07,500
looking for the tomb of Tal Rasha. No one knows exactly where Tal Rasha,

1546
05:12:07,500 --> 05:12:11,819
keeper of Baal, is entombed, but it is certain to be far out in the desert. Thank God the skeleton

1547
05:12:11,819 --> 05:12:18,139
came with you. Now my people whisper tales of the dead rising from their tombs and horrible creatures

1548
05:12:18,139 --> 05:12:33,590
lurking amongst the moonlit dunes. Not explained. Okay, it's you raising the dead. How do I know I

1549
05:12:33,590 --> 05:12:52,200
could trust you? I can trust you. Welcome to my shop. Better potions now. I'm bringing him money.

1550
05:12:55,259 --> 05:13:04,299
This skeleton needs to calm the fuck down. He's fine. He's just out of bath. That's why he's

1551
05:13:04,299 --> 05:13:22,869
doing this. All right, so the first thing you do here is obviously you gotta take the townspeople

1552
05:13:22,869 --> 05:13:30,279
of Lutgulain, trust you. You gotta clear out the sewers. I've heard that you are responsible for

1553
05:13:30,279 --> 05:13:40,650
banishing Andariel back to the burning head press stranger. Only noobs do every quest? For which

1554
05:13:40,650 --> 05:13:45,369
you're up against, my friend. You ought to look over my inventory of items. All right, the portal

1555
05:13:45,369 --> 05:13:51,130
is still there. That's right. I can go loot still. Okay, do the sewers. The sewers actually can kind

1556
05:13:51,130 --> 05:14:04,150
of suck. The enemies are not easy. Yeah, let's just go. Let's go loot the chamber. Yeah, it's still

1557
05:14:04,150 --> 05:14:48,009
here. Ah, we can still do it. All right, let's go to the back. Kill the cow? I can't do that till

1558
05:14:48,569 --> 05:14:54,340
the owl is dead, right? Or is that only after Act 1? I don't remember. It's been so long.

1559
05:14:55,619 --> 05:15:11,880
Just do the cow level? Can I do it? Can I? No, I can't do it yet. Okay, he's killed Bael. Yeah.

1560
05:15:12,919 --> 05:15:21,080
All right, was there anything back here? Nothing was even back here. But I did get companions,

1561
05:15:21,080 --> 05:15:30,009
though. You have so much gold. Yeah, I don't mind having that much gold on me because

1562
05:15:30,810 --> 05:15:41,450
it's not if I... Oh, if I die, I'm gonna lose it. No, I'll be fine. Yeah, we're good. Please pick up

1563
05:15:41,450 --> 05:16:03,380
the gold. I beg you. You just did. Okay, let us do the sewers. Remember, say Bael. Bael. Where's

1564
05:16:03,380 --> 05:16:10,819
Atama? They're being attacked and harassed by enemies underneath the sewers. It's your job to

1565
05:16:10,819 --> 05:16:20,229
take care of them. There's the guy to gamble with. How much money do I have? I don't have that much

1566
05:16:20,229 --> 05:17:02,540
money at all. Watch me just die here. Easy. Don't get too cocky. Fire resistance? Not very good.

1567
05:17:03,580 --> 05:17:14,419
Not very good. Did we just get... Did two raids come in at the same exact time? Wait, what?

1568
05:17:17,880 --> 05:17:21,400
A double raid? Was this intentional or is this unintentional?

1569
05:17:21,799 --> 05:17:37,130
A box box came in with a huge raid and so did XFSN Saber. That's pretty crazy. Welcome, guys.

1570
05:17:40,439 --> 05:17:47,419
Hope both of you had a good stream. It's on slow-mo follower only. Oh, well, that's not good.

1571
05:17:48,139 --> 05:17:58,540
All right, turn it off. Back in demons instead. If you're wondering what you're doing, why are you

1572
05:17:58,540 --> 05:18:04,060
playing Diablo 2? It's 2020. What are you doing? And it's vanilla Diablo 2. I don't know. I just

1573
05:18:04,060 --> 05:18:11,340
felt like doing it. This is hardcore and Chad is picking every stat and skill and they picked

1574
05:18:11,340 --> 05:18:20,900
the class too. So blame them for the 48 strength and 32 dex I have. But welcome. Thanks, guys.

1575
05:18:23,740 --> 05:18:28,380
They're free. Push them back. What do you mean no, we aren't? I could have just died right there.

1576
05:18:30,580 --> 05:18:37,750
You almost just killed me, guys. You almost just fucking killed me. All right, that's a lot of

1577
05:18:37,750 --> 05:18:44,459
arrows. I actually... That's a lot of enemies and a lot of arrows. I don't think this is going to

1578
05:18:44,459 --> 05:19:00,520
last very much longer. I'll be completely honest. Hey, I'm new here. What kind of streamer are you?

1579
05:19:01,240 --> 05:19:05,639
No, you know, I like to dabble in fucking all kinds of fun stuff. You know,

1580
05:19:06,119 --> 05:19:12,599
Nintendo, Mega Man fan. I just love Mega Man.

1581
05:19:34,060 --> 05:19:45,479
Why is it so loud? Is it still that loud? Even after turning down to almost a zero? After all

1582
05:19:45,479 --> 05:20:20,419
this, turn up my voice like that. Is that better? Can you hear me now? Hello? Hi. How are you?

1583
05:20:20,419 --> 05:20:37,930
Can you hear me? Yes. Now I'm too loud. Well, what is this? A thousand times better than what

1584
05:20:37,930 --> 05:20:57,580
I have on right now. Yeah. We get a skill point for this too, by the way. I can't believe I'm

1585
05:20:57,580 --> 05:21:02,700
fucking swinging at people with a weapon. I still can't believe I'm doing this.

1586
05:21:04,619 --> 05:21:24,500
Where is everybody? Get over here. Where is everybody? Are you body blocked? Get over here.

1587
05:21:25,299 --> 05:21:47,740
Look at the level two. Oh no, I can hear the game.

1588
05:21:50,069 --> 05:22:15,259
Where do I go? Down here? I forgot about the bone armor. Well, I've died. Look at how I'm so spread

1589
05:22:15,259 --> 05:22:21,380
out with skills. I don't, yes, I forgot about the bone armor. There's a point in teeth guys.

1590
05:22:22,099 --> 05:22:58,340
I forgot. I'm sorry. Just wait till we get the cube. I think we're doing all right. Let's go.

1591
05:22:58,340 --> 05:23:30,169
I forgot my name was Tommy Lee Bones. Who came up with that? Does he got x or enchanted? Get away

1592
05:23:30,169 --> 05:23:53,299
from him. Does he explode? No. I always think people explode, but you have to. You have to be

1593
05:23:53,299 --> 05:24:12,310
so careful. All right. This is a stalemate. This is a stalemate. That's better. I can't hurt anybody.

1594
05:24:14,650 --> 05:24:28,099
Can't hurt anything. This is where it all collapses. They're starting to win. This is,

1595
05:24:28,099 --> 05:24:44,229
yep, this is where it collapses. Any healing potions too? God damn it.

1596
05:24:50,630 --> 05:25:04,950
Yeah, we can level up. Where'd your potions go? I've been using them. All right, stat points. What

1597
05:25:04,950 --> 05:25:38,869
do you think? Here's your look. You need another tooth. No, one is fine. One tooth is fine. Pretty

1598
05:25:38,869 --> 05:26:04,330
split. Strength, vitality. Guys, energy is useless. Well, that's sort of accurate in a way.

1599
05:26:07,340 --> 05:26:25,849
All right, close it in 10 seconds. All right. Oh, we're getting indecisive. What is going on?

1600
05:26:26,729 --> 05:26:55,020
What the fuck is going on? Why is this so fucked up again? It's fixed. Sorry, I'm clicking a million

1601
05:26:55,020 --> 05:27:04,169
times a second. Use a straw pole? Yeah, but I have to make a new straw pole for every new stat point.

1602
05:27:04,889 --> 05:27:26,200
All right, that's good. Vitality. That's a lot of vitality. In fact, that might be too much.

1603
05:27:26,680 --> 05:27:34,919
I don't know. All right, let's take a look at we have unlocked some new things. We've got a bone

1604
05:27:34,919 --> 05:27:43,590
wall. Bone armor still. We're in the bone category here. Keep in mind, if I put one point into this,

1605
05:27:43,590 --> 05:27:49,959
it's going to make this increase by plus 15 absorption. Just letting you know. Just gonna

1606
05:27:49,959 --> 05:27:57,590
put it out there in case anybody was curious. You cannot have more than one golem out at a time.

1607
05:27:57,590 --> 05:28:03,529
Keep that in mind. This is blood golem. It's a golem that shares with you the life it steals

1608
05:28:03,529 --> 05:28:17,419
and damage it receives, right? Okay, so this is we share health and I forgot. I forgot about this one.

1609
05:28:28,380 --> 05:28:40,439
It converts 86% damage to life and we also share damage. That's the thing. In the curse category,

1610
05:28:40,439 --> 05:28:52,630
we can't even go down past iron maiden. You can do lifesteal and of course, we still have points

1611
05:28:52,709 --> 05:29:03,299
into mastery and free skeleton. Whatever it is you guys want to do. Pick a category, please.

1612
05:29:09,209 --> 05:29:19,849
You didn't, you don't mention the teeth. No, I said don't do teeth. Well, hold on a minute here.

1613
05:29:19,849 --> 05:29:24,680
Just because you guys pick it doesn't mean I have to use it. You understand that, right?

1614
05:29:26,840 --> 05:29:33,000
If you guys select blood golem, I don't have to summon them. What do you mean wrong? You guys

1615
05:29:33,000 --> 05:29:44,229
could put 20 points into blood golem and I won't summon them once. No, but we can waste 20 levels

1616
05:29:44,229 --> 05:30:06,180
in it. Okay, well, here we go. Summoning. What am I doing? Why would I use blood golem on hardcore?

1617
05:30:07,220 --> 05:30:29,959
You want to see what it does? Because we want to get to fire golem. Yeah, all right. I will,

1618
05:30:29,959 --> 05:30:41,240
you know, let me show you guys the other golems too. Blood golem, iron golem transforms a metallic

1619
05:30:41,240 --> 05:30:49,479
item into a golem that gains the properties of the item and it also has thorns. So you have to

1620
05:30:49,479 --> 05:30:55,819
throw an item on the ground and then at the very bottom is fire golem. It's a golem that converts

1621
05:30:55,819 --> 05:31:03,580
the damage it receives from fire into life and it's just a beast. You only have one golem out at a

1622
05:31:03,580 --> 05:31:21,700
time. Reef people's drops with iron golem. Well, that's if you are a sicko. So blood golem gives

1623
05:31:21,700 --> 05:31:30,259
life to every golem, as you see. Play golem is attack rating, fire golem is damage to every

1624
05:31:30,259 --> 05:31:38,439
single one. But you picked blood golem, so I'm going to do it. He does look actually pretty

1625
05:31:38,439 --> 05:32:04,150
cool though. Let's see what he looks like. Gross. He just doesn't have any skin. Pizza golem. Spaghetti

1626
05:32:06,470 --> 05:32:49,029
sauce golem. All right, let's move. I didn't go that far, did I? Go get him. Can I heal him somehow?

1627
05:32:49,990 --> 05:33:07,380
I need more. He's kind of taking it pretty well. I'm still getting my ass kicked though.

1628
05:33:11,080 --> 05:33:40,360
When's he going to die already? I might be okay for a little while. Everyone's here. This was

1629
05:33:40,360 --> 05:33:50,459
supposed to be a disaster stream, but here we are. A rune. Yeah, you didn't think I was going to do

1630
05:33:50,459 --> 05:33:59,029
okay. Well, to be fair, you guys did pick. Not pick 20 points into dim vision.

1631
05:34:00,979 --> 05:34:10,220
We went over this. Yes, yes, yes. Get emotionally invested. Wait, is this so you can just pull the

1632
05:34:10,220 --> 05:34:17,509
rug from underneath me? All right, no town portals. That's great. Good job. Could have made him play

1633
05:34:17,509 --> 05:34:24,500
assassin. Yeah, I didn't say it in the beginning of the stream, but I hate assassin. I'm so bad

1634
05:34:24,500 --> 05:34:28,500
with assassin. I don't like the move sets. I hate it. I'm so glad you guys didn't pick assassin.

1635
05:34:29,700 --> 05:34:40,139
I would have died in the blood more. Yeah, I got to get the act two mercenary.

1636
05:34:49,340 --> 05:34:58,200
All right, everybody stuff in there. Stuff in the hallway. Picking up minor plots.

1637
05:35:00,279 --> 05:35:29,139
Stop. I know. I pick up everything. Oh, he's dead. Get in there. Oh, I got clay. Clay's back.

1638
05:35:29,139 --> 05:35:33,400
Oh, right, right, right. Because it's not. I'm going to change to blood.

1639
05:35:34,520 --> 05:35:41,700
You used blood going on one time. No, he's back. He's back. See? You got a full team.

1640
05:35:41,700 --> 05:35:56,740
Picking up minor potion. Now you got it in my head.

1641
05:36:03,500 --> 05:36:06,700
I feel like this is going to start to move a little more smoothly, though, because we're not.

1642
05:36:07,340 --> 05:36:10,299
I think you guys have an idea of what you're doing and what you want to do.

1643
05:36:11,180 --> 05:36:29,159
I think we might start rolling here. Almost to the boss. This boss sucks, if I remember.

1644
05:36:30,740 --> 05:36:34,020
He just resurrects everybody over and over again. And there's like 100 people in the room.

1645
05:36:35,139 --> 05:36:46,900
Once you see the quest marker pop up, that's when you have to freak out and make a portal.

1646
05:37:04,139 --> 05:37:09,959
Damn skeleton. Yeah. Make it so he can't do anything. Those are the plays.

1647
05:37:10,759 --> 05:37:52,060
And do I get a streamer's choice? Skill point? No. Really? Come on. No. All right. Fine. You

1648
05:37:52,060 --> 05:37:57,380
you can't have that as your title then. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, you're right. You're right.

1649
05:37:57,380 --> 05:38:19,340
Nobody getting hit by that. You can do it for a wink. I'm trying. I do more damage.

1650
05:38:19,979 --> 05:38:35,369
That morning's already good. Hmm. No. Get rid of this too. Fucking problem on the ground. Who

1651
05:38:35,369 --> 05:38:54,860
cares? Where is this guy? Show show my skill point. You know, you do. I know I could just pick it.

1652
05:38:54,860 --> 05:39:11,299
Right. I mean, it'll break every rule, but I can do it. You're still alive. Yeah. Oh, it has to be

1653
05:39:11,299 --> 05:39:19,290
down here. There's no other options. It's always the worst thing in these games when you look at

1654
05:39:19,290 --> 05:39:23,770
every single possible avenue and it's the one tiny little spot that you didn't go down.

1655
05:39:24,900 --> 05:39:49,299
Right here. This little sliver. Don't die. Wink. Did a wink come through? All right. I need to.

1656
05:39:49,299 --> 05:40:14,650
It's not even it. Where is the where is the right place? Top left? No. The fuck lower left.

1657
05:40:14,650 --> 05:40:28,569
I think it's the only place it's not. I think it's down here. Am I correct? Oh, yep. Okay. Yeah.

1658
05:40:28,569 --> 05:40:39,779
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I'm going to get 10. Hold on. Wait, I can't. I don't want to die.

1659
05:40:40,500 --> 05:41:17,000
I'm going to revive them first before you do. Apologize. What? I didn't do anything.

1660
05:41:17,560 --> 05:42:15,930
There we go. Weaken. See how much of an area that is. All right. Get him. He's got a lot of health.

1661
05:42:23,860 --> 05:42:25,619
Book of skill and scale mail.

1662
05:42:26,500 --> 05:42:49,240
I love that sound. That's pretty good. 17 health. Two mana after each kill.

1663
05:42:50,119 --> 05:43:03,610
Free skill point. Hey, that strength is coming in handy somehow. I might just put life in it.

1664
05:43:04,650 --> 05:43:18,580
Oh, I can't leave. Roderick scroll. This tells you where the cube is. The Roderick cube.

1665
05:43:19,380 --> 05:43:34,470
Get that socketed sword. Superior crystal. Seven to 24. Five to 15. Wait, hold on. Let's go examine

1666
05:43:34,470 --> 05:43:55,560
this. Imbue it. What level is it? 43. Five to 15. If I imbue it, it's probably just going to turn into

1667
05:43:55,560 --> 05:44:16,979
this. I can't imbue it. I'm going to only imbue white items, right? Here we go. Wait until hell

1668
05:44:16,979 --> 05:44:20,740
to imbue anything. Do you think I'm going to make it to hell with this character?

1669
05:44:22,099 --> 05:44:43,110
You're putting a lot of faith in me. You couldn't do it? Gotta get there first.

1670
05:44:43,669 --> 05:44:50,330
Open the chamber's hidden door. They're nearly losing one to the thievery of a rogue sorcerer.

1671
05:44:50,330 --> 05:44:57,380
They divided Aldrich's staves into two parts. Wooden shaft. Yep. Get the shaft. Get the head.

1672
05:44:58,250 --> 05:45:08,340
Get the cube. Played the game before. His name's not Dylan. All right. Here's where we get weird

1673
05:45:08,900 --> 05:45:19,369
because should I? Should I? I could add eight to 12 fire damage in this. That's kind of good.

1674
05:45:20,520 --> 05:45:33,939
That makes it better than this. And I could add five to eight. This could be like 30 or 40 damage.

1675
05:45:34,659 --> 05:45:41,369
It's fire damage, man. Save it for a better weapon. Yeah, but these gems just suck anyways.

1676
05:45:51,750 --> 05:45:55,029
I'm going to get the cube and I can start making stuff. Yeah, that's true. Hold on. Let's

1677
05:45:55,590 --> 05:46:34,310
organize this. Stop moving the gems. What? What? It's not by color. It's by quantity. Quantity.

1678
05:46:38,330 --> 05:46:44,729
Outward. Red is fire. Yellow is lightning. Blue is cold. White is undead. Green is poison. And

1679
05:46:46,709 --> 05:46:54,009
purple is attack rating. And then there's light steel, which is good. Very good.

1680
05:46:54,970 --> 05:47:02,090
And then you have these ruins. You can make ruin words. Very, very, very powerful. But we're not

1681
05:47:02,090 --> 05:47:22,330
going to do that any then. No. Or potentially ever. Good day. Need potions. And give me max out the

1682
05:47:22,330 --> 05:47:26,330
scrolls. I want 20. Just do 20 and 20. I know Cain does it all, but I want to be able to do it on the fly.

1683
05:47:27,369 --> 05:47:38,139
All right. So now we return to Atma for rewards. Makes it so it's less expensive to do everything.

1684
05:47:38,139 --> 05:47:48,860
Isn't she in here? Where is she? Where is Atma? Down here. They say that the taste of vengeance

1685
05:47:48,860 --> 05:47:57,619
is bittersweet. Yep. Press completed. Now we have to go. This is kind of a painful part of the game

1686
05:47:58,580 --> 05:48:06,090
because you have to go run around the giant wasteland.

1687
05:48:06,970 --> 05:48:19,849
Yeah. The rocky waste. You have to run around and it can be really kind of a pain in the ass.

1688
05:48:22,220 --> 05:48:30,310
And all the bugs have electricity. They're already painful.

1689
05:48:30,869 --> 05:48:48,919
Oh, we just have to move. We're going to walk around. Get a mercenary. I will. I'm going to

1690
05:48:48,919 --> 05:48:55,080
come back to town. We're going to have two points to burn. All of Act 2 suck. I mean,

1691
05:48:57,939 --> 05:49:04,259
Act 4 is probably my favorite. Act 4 and Act 5 are awesome. Just because Act 4 is such a mess.

1692
05:49:04,259 --> 05:49:16,139
It's just hundreds of enemies. It's just a giant open world with a ton of enemies.

1693
05:49:21,770 --> 05:49:46,009
Yeah. I would say Act 3 is worse than Act 2. Hold enchanted run. There it is. Level up.

1694
05:49:48,180 --> 05:50:05,419
Really want to be somewhere around 20 here. 20 to 25. Is it dead? Kill it. What does Eldoron do?

1695
05:50:06,060 --> 05:50:14,630
76% damage to undead. I mean, you could have an undead killing weapon if you have a sick slot

1696
05:50:14,630 --> 05:50:18,310
weapon. That'd be pretty cool. I almost just did these out of just habit and I almost, people

1697
05:50:18,310 --> 05:50:24,380
almost just freaked out. All right. We've got two skill points to put in. Well, you can take a look

1698
05:50:24,380 --> 05:50:35,700
what we have and to refresh your memory. If you want to just see it again, you kind of know how

1699
05:50:35,700 --> 05:50:51,900
this all works at this point. Bone wall, poison dagger, teeth, bone armor. I don't really care

1700
05:50:51,900 --> 05:51:25,909
about curses in this chat, I don't think. Okay. Let's pick something. Pick a category. Very clear

1701
05:51:25,909 --> 05:52:07,880
at the moment. Okay. It is. Fun deal. What skill? Fun not found. Fun not found. Do bone wall. Well,

1702
05:52:07,880 --> 05:52:11,880
convince your fellow chatters to select bone wall. That's, you gotta, you gotta do that.

1703
05:52:12,840 --> 05:52:53,509
Another point is going into blood golem. Please pick a category for the second skill point. Okay.

1704
05:52:54,549 --> 05:53:02,119
Some of you want curses. I feel bad for you guys because I don't think you're ever going to get

1705
05:53:02,119 --> 05:53:09,909
what you want. I'm not sure you guys are ever going to get what you want. Poison and bone.

1706
05:53:10,790 --> 05:53:18,419
I think I know where you're going. Could be wrong though.

1707
05:53:32,680 --> 05:53:39,689
We want teeth. We want teeth. I've actually tried to make teeth work before. You can kind of make

1708
05:53:39,770 --> 05:53:56,150
it work. It's really stupid though. All right. Bone ball. We do stats yet? We did not. All right.

1709
05:53:56,150 --> 05:54:11,770
So we got bone wall and blood golem too. All right. Want to see what bone wall looks like?

1710
05:54:17,610 --> 05:54:59,450
Kind of cool looking. Tell me. Jesus. Please be unique. Skeletons are dying guys. Skeletons

1711
05:54:59,450 --> 05:55:15,450
are not lasting very long. I repeat. Skeletons are not lasting very long. I repeat. Skeletons.

1712
05:55:19,319 --> 05:55:26,099
I told you we need to buff them you danguses. I'm just, I'm just going to put it out there.

1713
05:55:26,099 --> 05:55:30,740
If you're going to have skeletons, the game is getting progressively more help, more damage on

1714
05:55:30,740 --> 05:55:39,720
enemy. You can't just go spend it where you can't just blow it on bone walls. All right. Let's do

1715
05:55:39,720 --> 05:56:19,299
stats. Who does he think he is? Do you have a name? Strength or energy or vitality?

1716
05:56:22,470 --> 05:56:29,590
Bad influencer. He's a bad influencer. He's a bad influencer. All right. Strength. Thanks for ruining

1717
05:56:29,590 --> 05:56:49,240
the game. Again, appreciate it. Look at all these abilities. It's just all over the place.

1718
05:56:50,040 --> 05:56:54,119
I have to redo this. I'm never going to do weaken. Amplified damage is always going to be done.

1719
05:56:54,119 --> 05:57:05,110
Okay. F1 is bone armor. F2 amplify. F3 bone wall. F4 blood golem. F5 skeleton. F6 skeletal mage.

1720
05:57:05,669 --> 05:57:21,240
That's a little bit better. Okay. Let's go. All right. Where are we at?

1721
05:57:23,819 --> 05:57:26,860
We're going to be in the far hills of the cube. I want the cube so I can mess with the

1722
05:57:27,819 --> 05:57:49,590
recipes. It's a lot of fun. Can you wink at me in person? That just doesn't. All right. The

1723
05:57:49,590 --> 05:57:52,869
marshmallow wall does not do very much here. I don't even know why I'm going to. Why would I

1724
05:57:52,869 --> 05:58:21,380
use that? All right. It's cube hunting time. I got to get it. Where would I go? All right.

1725
05:58:21,380 --> 05:58:29,099
Rocky waste. We need the far hills. All right. All's the dead under the dry hills. Okay. Up

1726
05:58:29,099 --> 05:58:54,819
this way. I'm going to move. Don't run into people. That's the cast rate. No. Actually,

1727
05:58:54,819 --> 05:59:12,549
I probably should use bone wall here. Oh, dry hills. There it is.

1728
05:59:17,139 --> 05:59:33,099
Okay, mage. Blowing mage. Should have got the cast rate. I'm summoning necromancer though. I'm

1729
05:59:33,099 --> 06:00:00,759
not going to need it. At last. I need them to be strong so we can fight the boss. I need to be

1730
06:00:00,759 --> 06:00:24,090
strong. This is up to the... For the halls of the dead. Find it. Find it. Dude, this dude chugged

1731
06:00:24,090 --> 06:00:40,729
that entire bottle. Yeah. Why do I think that's so funny? I played a ton of Diablo 3. Now you're

1732
06:00:40,729 --> 06:00:46,740
making me get Diablo 2. Diablo 2 is a fantastic game. It's been an incredible experience. It's

1733
06:00:46,740 --> 06:00:54,840
one of the best games ever. It's one of the best games ever. Found it. Halls of the dead.

1734
06:00:54,840 --> 06:01:07,659
Let's make a little spot here. We don't have any more mages so let's get them. Sapphire.

1735
06:01:18,680 --> 06:01:23,319
I've burnt an embarrassing amount of time in these games.

1736
06:01:29,369 --> 06:01:38,299
It's truly, truly so much time. I don't remember much from when I was 16 except for

1737
06:01:39,180 --> 06:01:51,540
playing Diablo 2 when I got out of school. Every day. Every single day. And even

1738
06:01:52,340 --> 06:02:06,790
out of high school and college every day. Oh, this is a bad room. I gotta get in here. I gotta help

1739
06:02:09,340 --> 06:02:34,599
too many people. He's really gonna get trapped in these rooms. I gotta kill the guy resurrecting.

1740
06:02:34,599 --> 06:02:59,750
Get over here. Oh, hit this. I have no dexterity. Right. I forgot. How are we doing? Just one

1741
06:02:59,750 --> 06:03:16,139
mage. How the fuck does this build for the late game? On a scale of... We're gonna hit a wall

1742
06:03:16,139 --> 06:03:21,979
when I get to the boss of this act. It's really gonna determine if this is gonna be even humanly

1743
06:03:21,979 --> 06:03:39,529
possible. No good items. It's annoying. I really wish I had more skeletons. I wish that I had more

1744
06:03:39,529 --> 06:03:46,439
skeletons and they were stronger. You know, I mean if we're gonna put six, seven, eight, nine,

1745
06:03:46,439 --> 06:03:52,950
ten, eleven, twelve points into skeletons. I really, you know, just wish they were just a tad

1746
06:03:52,950 --> 06:04:14,549
stronger than they are now. Bonewall school don't get me wrong. You guys are indecisive. Fucking

1747
06:04:14,549 --> 06:04:32,819
boomers. All right. Decks and teeth. Got it. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh,

1748
06:04:32,819 --> 06:04:36,099
don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot.

1749
06:04:37,369 --> 06:04:41,450
There's a fucking, there's a trillion people in this room. I gotta go around the corners.

1750
06:04:43,700 --> 06:05:07,560
Kill him. Okay, we're good. I hit him. Okay, we're good. Use bone wall.

1751
06:05:08,520 --> 06:05:15,529
Oh, what? I already have a bone wall. It's standing around swinging its stuff.

1752
06:05:16,090 --> 06:05:45,509
Move to level two. All right, now's my opportunity. Good. I gotta wrap a run. What is it? How many

1753
06:05:45,509 --> 06:06:23,340
players is it set to? Four? Come here. Only one unique this whole game so far. Yeah,

1754
06:06:25,459 --> 06:06:32,040
an unusual bro. I have one. It's really good. Arguably one of the reasons why I'm doing okay.

1755
06:06:32,840 --> 06:06:39,639
Ah, because it's just a dump of health. A ton more hit recovery, which is a huge deal in this game.

1756
06:06:40,439 --> 06:06:58,439
Hit recovery will kill you more than anything else. I remember pre-expansion never getting

1757
06:06:58,439 --> 06:07:04,630
it unique. Yeah, it happened. It did happen. Once you start playing on Nightmare in Hell,

1758
06:07:04,630 --> 06:07:09,779
though, they drop all of the plays, especially from the bosses. A boss will drop a unique

1759
06:07:10,919 --> 06:07:17,639
or a set at least one out of every, especially if you have magic find. Magic find is so important

1760
06:07:17,639 --> 06:07:26,040
in this game. Why am I talking like I'm going to be able to do this? Once we get to Nightmare in

1761
06:07:26,040 --> 06:07:41,099
Hell, I'm going to have 200% magic find. That's not happening. I'll be lucky to get the axe free.

1762
06:07:43,430 --> 06:07:58,659
You're underestimating the bones. It is good. Looking for the cube in here somewhere.

1763
06:08:05,580 --> 06:08:12,459
He's getting class jealous. He's getting class jealous. This is bad. If I was a sorceress right

1764
06:08:12,459 --> 06:08:20,569
now, I would melt this whole room in one second. It would just be like everything would just die.

1765
06:08:21,529 --> 06:08:38,520
That wouldn't be very interesting. If I had Nova right now, I would just walk in a room,

1766
06:08:38,520 --> 06:08:41,860
right click three times and run to the next room. It'd be great.

1767
06:08:54,360 --> 06:08:59,669
No, I do, which is why I'm playing it. I could have said at the beginning of the stream,

1768
06:08:59,669 --> 06:09:07,860
no, no, no, no. I don't want to do skeletons. No, stop. Stop. No, I'm done. Hey, we're still here.

1769
06:09:08,819 --> 06:09:21,610
We kind of did. Why am I so good at beatboxing? I'm not really.

1770
06:09:24,330 --> 06:09:35,700
I can just go like this and this and this. Pretty much it. Resist fire.

1771
06:09:37,939 --> 06:09:55,400
I just got a taste in my mouth. What was it? I just sensed a flavor of some sort. I'm trying

1772
06:09:55,400 --> 06:10:02,650
to figure out what it was. I just smelt it and tasted something. It was like a chard. What is

1773
06:10:02,650 --> 06:10:10,040
that something? I just got like this random memory of a flavor and it was like a charred

1774
06:10:10,040 --> 06:10:14,040
kind of meat flavor, but it's not meat. What was it? I don't know. It's freaking me out.

1775
06:10:14,680 --> 06:10:40,040
What is it? It's like a smoke, like a smoky flavor. Very charred though. Turn off the stove.

1776
06:10:42,409 --> 06:10:57,939
Oh shit. It's been on all day. Hey, waypoint. Now I can run my friends through the whole game

1777
06:10:58,500 --> 06:11:19,319
in less than 40 minutes. Oh, but I can't play online because I was banned from battle. Oh,

1778
06:11:19,319 --> 06:11:26,520
I had a dream about the stream actually. So I had a dream that so I got this wallet.

1779
06:11:26,520 --> 06:11:31,080
No, this is the dream happening. Okay. So I got this wallet recently and I actually really like it.

1780
06:11:32,740 --> 06:11:41,900
It's great. It's this shiny metal small like travel wallet, right? It's my dreams happening

1781
06:11:41,900 --> 06:11:51,209
right now. It's called the ridge. It's actually a great wallet. It's fantastic. It's really good.

1782
06:11:52,470 --> 06:12:00,860
I had a dream last night that I was sponsored by this company that makes this wallet. I don't

1783
06:12:00,860 --> 06:12:08,340
know why. For some reason. And I was nervously doing a presentation for it while the chat and

1784
06:12:08,340 --> 06:12:15,979
there were like 30,000 people here for some reason. And it was just a wall, a spam of like,

1785
06:12:15,979 --> 06:12:22,619
I'm fucking out of here. Unsubbing loser. You piece of shit. Fuck you. Fucking loser. How dare

1786
06:12:22,619 --> 06:12:31,720
you? And it was like, no, no, people weren't joking. It was like last stream. I'll have a go to

1787
06:12:31,720 --> 06:12:38,619
just a wall of just, everyone was so mad. And I'm sitting there going like, and as you see the,

1788
06:12:39,340 --> 06:12:44,360
and I kept looking over and going, no, if fuck anyone hates this, but like I haven't

1789
06:12:44,360 --> 06:12:47,799
been doing it. And as you can see, you can fit like 10 credit cards in here. And

1790
06:12:48,759 --> 06:12:53,060
I was getting so nervous. It was a sponsored dream. Yeah.

1791
06:12:55,930 --> 06:13:24,740
I don't have any friends. Where'd they all go? They'll hide. Give me the cube so I can get out

1792
06:13:24,740 --> 06:13:47,130
of here. He thinks we hate him in his dreams. You know, I think dream you, the dream you,

1793
06:13:47,130 --> 06:13:51,369
at least I'm going to give you some benefit of the doubt here. Dream you guys. It just came out of

1794
06:13:51,369 --> 06:13:56,939
nowhere. I didn't say, Hey guys, like tomorrow's going to be a sponsored segment or Hey guys,

1795
06:13:56,939 --> 06:14:01,740
this is going to be a stream tomorrow. Hey guys, this is company. No, I, it was just, I turned on

1796
06:14:01,740 --> 06:14:07,419
my webcam and started going and was stone faced just doing an ad. That wasn't a joke. So it was

1797
06:14:07,419 --> 06:14:17,020
just like, what are you, what is this Jeremy? My face was like kind of red. The wallhuts are great.

1798
06:14:17,900 --> 06:14:27,909
They really are. I love it. This is pretty scummy. It seems like we were right.

1799
06:14:28,150 --> 06:14:41,290
No, but it wasn't, it wasn't even stuff like, Oh, unsubbed. I'm out of here. It was real mean,

1800
06:14:41,290 --> 06:15:00,950
horrible shit. It wasn't just like, Oh, unsubbed. Oh, hello. Well, you know,

1801
06:15:03,139 --> 06:15:12,939
have a hands. Where is the cube? Where is the cube? I'm getting so unlucky. You wonder why this

1802
06:15:12,939 --> 06:15:19,580
has been six hours into act one, act two, whatever. It's because I keep my RNG so bad. I can't get,

1803
06:15:19,979 --> 06:15:41,130
I think this is it. At least we're going to have the cube though. What should I have for dinner?

1804
06:15:44,729 --> 06:16:09,500
Any food suggestions in the chat here? Only good ones, please. No, not pizza. No, no. Japanese

1805
06:16:09,500 --> 06:16:17,700
salmon. Oh, I don't really have any food. Stir fry. That's not bad. Sounds pretty good.

1806
06:16:19,060 --> 06:16:34,200
I wonder what that flavor was though. I don't remember. This is still not the cube room.

1807
06:16:34,840 --> 06:16:45,700
How have I not found the cube yet? I have no idea. Oh, the cube. I already found the cube. It's in

1808
06:16:45,700 --> 06:17:04,500
the room down here. What am I? Did I not see it? How did I not see this? Cube. Okay. There it is.

1809
06:17:05,459 --> 06:17:15,450
The Herodric cube. You have quite a treasure there in that Herodric cube. You have, you have

1810
06:17:15,450 --> 06:17:21,049
quite a treasure there. You have, I'm trying, I'll get it. You have quite a treasure there in that

1811
06:17:21,049 --> 06:17:51,590
Herodric cube. You ready? And go. More. Blood Sapphire. Hey, he's available. He's available.

1812
06:17:57,319 --> 06:18:14,740
He's, yes, I'm available. Any more? Nope. That's it. What am I holding onto this for?

1813
06:18:15,619 --> 06:18:38,060
These rings are terrible. Salad. Let's get rid of this thing. Just taking up space.

1814
06:18:38,060 --> 06:19:14,650
Okay. Prepare. Save the money. You can convert three rings into an amulet. Yeah, that's true. But

1815
06:19:17,400 --> 06:19:31,720
no, no. All right, let's go. Time to find. Oh, the maggot lair. The best place in the game.

1816
06:19:34,630 --> 06:19:54,709
Best place in the game. Damn it. I think that's so hard.

1817
06:19:55,509 --> 06:20:03,990
Oh, God. God damn it. Somebody watched my stream for like 60 hours. I have to turn on my camera

1818
06:20:03,990 --> 06:20:24,549
and go like this. God damn it. It's like such a, so hard to do that apparently. Stony tomb. All

1819
06:20:24,549 --> 06:20:32,020
right. Fire Wastes. I'm making pretty good time in act two. Would act one take like six hours? We're

1820
06:20:32,020 --> 06:20:50,979
like, we're almost like halfway through act two and it's been like 40 minutes. Shit. Stamina.

1821
06:21:01,959 --> 06:21:10,139
He didn't spend a half an hour allocating stats. Well, you, you got, but you guys had to do that.

1822
06:21:10,700 --> 06:21:13,419
You guys had to know the tree. Now you guys know the tree.

1823
06:21:14,380 --> 06:21:18,060
You know kind of the direction you want to take the character and we can, we can move forward.

1824
06:21:25,990 --> 06:21:41,159
You're blaming us. Yes. Yeah. Every time I hear the ring drop, I just, I want, I want it to be

1825
06:21:41,159 --> 06:22:02,419
unique. So bad. These little ships are the worst. Has he died yet? Nope. I have not.

1826
06:22:21,509 --> 06:22:29,049
Arctic binding plus 40 cold. Hey, and guess who that's for. Guess who that's going to be great

1827
06:22:29,049 --> 06:22:45,380
for. The boss of this 30 defense and 40% cold resist. Take a look at this shit. It's almost 60.

1828
06:22:45,380 --> 06:22:53,080
Oh, I lose a slot, but it's all right. Almost 60%. Good. Resident sleeper. Wake up, wake up,

1829
06:22:53,080 --> 06:22:59,610
man. Wake up, bro. Wake up. All right. Don't stand still in hardcore. What are you dumb?

1830
06:23:13,580 --> 06:23:24,950
I need more mages for that. Wake me up when we're at a hundred strength.

1831
06:23:26,150 --> 06:23:36,470
Where's my pancake? Why am I, how am I responsible for getting new pancakes?

1832
06:23:37,349 --> 06:23:52,779
You got to take care of your own pancakes. How is it? It's not that bad. It's like nine 30.

1833
06:23:55,000 --> 06:24:08,279
Oh, there's a nephron. It's two 20. Ah, right, right, right. I live on the other side of the world.

1834
06:24:08,759 --> 06:24:17,369
Um, well, in six and a half hours, we'll see what we're at in like 30 minutes.

1835
06:24:19,290 --> 06:24:27,930
What do you guys think? You guys, you guys want a conclusion to this? I mean,

1836
06:24:27,930 --> 06:24:46,099
I feel like we kind of have to see the conclusion. You got to keep going until you die. I need

1837
06:24:46,099 --> 06:24:51,819
far away. So I think it's far away. It's connected to dry hill. Don't get off until you die. Well,

1838
06:24:51,819 --> 06:25:07,830
that's probably not going to happen. We get back up here. How are you even still alive?

1839
06:25:07,830 --> 06:25:11,349
Because chat accidentally made a character that wasn't completely useless.

1840
06:25:12,229 --> 06:25:40,020
We knew what we were doing. Yeah, that's why I'm still alive. But I don't think 14 or 15

1841
06:25:40,020 --> 06:25:48,659
points in teeth would get us this far. It just wouldn't. It would not have happened.

1842
06:25:49,619 --> 06:26:12,009
Yes, it would have. Ridge wallets are real. Yeah, I have one. I know. But I didn't,

1843
06:26:12,009 --> 06:26:16,330
that wasn't part of the dream. Part of the dream was not that the wallets weren't real.

1844
06:26:16,330 --> 06:26:41,299
Stupid ass. Get out of here. We've got their ridge wallets in my spaghetti.

1845
06:26:42,099 --> 06:26:53,400
No, we've gone. I only talk about products that are actually useful. JetBlue, a useful product.

1846
06:26:54,119 --> 06:26:58,119
Ridge wallet, a very useful actual product that you should probably get if you need a wallet.

1847
06:26:58,840 --> 06:27:15,529
I have nothing to do with them. I just know because I use them. It's my last time being here.

1848
06:27:19,479 --> 06:27:40,200
Stamina is killing me. Admit to the joke. Show the wallet on the camera. I mean, I do really

1849
06:27:40,200 --> 06:27:48,919
want me to go get my ridge wallet and show you. I mean, it's it's not much to see. It's just a

1850
06:27:48,919 --> 06:28:01,720
wallet. No. Yeah, but I've got like, I got like credit cards and my license in there and shit.

1851
06:28:01,720 --> 06:28:11,669
I'm not doing that. I'll just, I can just take, I'll take them out. There we go. Far away.

1852
06:28:17,659 --> 06:28:33,659
Actually not a terrible charm. Pretty good charm actually for right now. Champion in there. Watch

1853
06:28:33,659 --> 06:29:11,259
it. They get melted. Jesus. Oh, it's because this guy's here. Oh, a jewel. It's out though.

1854
06:29:11,259 --> 06:29:23,819
It's lying about the wallet. Oh, I own one. I'll get it in a minute. Well, when we take break two,

1855
06:29:24,939 --> 06:29:29,419
that's the last break of the night. I will get the ridge wallet and I will show you the wallet.

1856
06:29:30,299 --> 06:29:50,060
See, picky bugs. Yes, lots of bugs. This is why this part sucks because there's so many random

1857
06:29:50,060 --> 06:30:02,459
enemies everywhere. I'm close to the maggot there though. Oh, the zombie head. You're right. This

1858
06:30:02,459 --> 06:30:09,290
could be plus to something good. Okay. All right. Well, now thank you for telling me to go get that

1859
06:30:09,290 --> 06:30:17,900
one guy because this is plus two to raise skeleton. One to clay golem and one to bone wolf. I lose

1860
06:30:17,900 --> 06:30:26,439
corpse explosion and weaken. Don't care. I didn't use them anyways. Go. How many can I have now?

1861
06:30:27,159 --> 06:30:34,310
That's it with eight points. Oh, the next point is five.

1862
06:30:58,619 --> 06:31:07,349
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I forgot about the bugs.

1863
06:31:14,569 --> 06:31:25,180
Swarm and shit. Yeah, they're killing everything. Oh, fuck off. You ridge wallet.

1864
06:31:31,319 --> 06:31:50,169
I got, I'm going back down. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to get it. I'm going to go get it.

1865
06:31:50,569 --> 06:32:05,740
Hold on. I also want to get the, an act two up here. It's higher. We're about to kill Kyle,

1866
06:32:05,740 --> 06:32:14,310
by the way. All right. Defensive. We want offensive, defensive or combat. That's the aura.

1867
06:32:14,310 --> 06:32:33,700
Probably defense. I want a level 19, 19 defense. Doesn't exist. Offense, level 19 offense. All

1868
06:32:33,700 --> 06:32:45,479
right. Yeah. What are the different auras? Combat is probably better. Combat's like blessing a might,

1869
06:32:45,479 --> 06:32:58,310
whatever it is. Combat aura is healing. It's the regen aura. Probably, probably not a bad idea.

1870
06:32:59,110 --> 06:33:04,310
Let us pick it when you piss. Defense is just pure defense and offense is I think attack bar,

1871
06:33:04,310 --> 06:33:08,900
right? All right. Let us pick. Yeah. I'm going to go pee. I'll let you guys pick and I'll come back.

1872
06:33:08,900 --> 06:33:29,189
I'll make the pole. Wait one second. Straw pole. Bring the wallet back. I will. And we can,

1873
06:33:29,509 --> 06:33:33,830
um, we'll play for like another 30, 40 minutes and see how everyone's feeling.

1874
06:33:34,630 --> 06:33:54,680
But it's, it's going to start to get late. Okay. Vote on this and I'll be back in about two or three

1875
06:33:54,680 --> 06:37:48,819
minutes. See you in a minute. Guys, the wall is not real. I fucking made it up. Or did I?

1876
06:37:48,819 --> 06:38:06,090
This is the wallet right here. There it is. Look at how thin this is. This opens to store cards.

1877
06:38:06,889 --> 06:38:13,849
You can slide, I believe up to 20 cards in here and looks like an SSD. There's all kinds of styles.

1878
06:38:13,849 --> 06:38:18,659
With this thing. Oh, you got your little, you can see the little thumb thing here.

1879
06:38:18,659 --> 06:38:24,259
If you get cards in here, you just, you just push, slide them when you want out, slide it right back

1880
06:38:24,259 --> 06:38:38,360
in. It's easy. Cast strap on the back. Secure. Ridge wallet. Pick one up. Maybe. If you feel

1881
06:38:38,360 --> 06:38:52,380
like getting a new wallet. Bye. They're really good. They're very good. They're secure. They're,

1882
06:38:52,939 --> 06:38:57,500
they fit into pants. You can actually put this into like a jacket pocket.

1883
06:38:58,459 --> 06:39:04,520
If you get, you put your essentials in here. It's light. It's got a nice click to it. It's,

1884
06:39:04,520 --> 06:39:13,450
it's very sturdy. Never coming back. I'm never coming back. Well, all right. What did you guys

1885
06:39:13,450 --> 06:39:28,700
pick? Offense. Apparently it's offense. All right. Uh, look for 1119 offense. And there we go.

1886
06:39:29,659 --> 06:39:48,459
Uh, or, what was his offense? Ilzan. The Nari. Or, uh, Vic Yat. Vic Yat. Life 270 versus

1887
06:39:49,419 --> 06:40:02,860
270, 155. Are they the same? Vic Yat? Who's Kyle? All right. You want, you want Vic? Okay. Uh,

1888
06:40:02,860 --> 06:40:07,819
who's Kyle? You'll see. Kyle's about to die. The mercenary will replace your current one.

1889
06:40:07,819 --> 06:40:24,540
Kyle is dead. There he is. Look at how much better. Level 19 damage. All right. We got to

1890
06:40:24,540 --> 06:40:34,520
deck you out. We got to deck you out with some stuff. We got to pick some kills. All right. We

1891
06:40:34,520 --> 06:40:42,919
need a spear. Seven to 18, seven to seven. Required 50 decks. Eight to 28. That's not bad.

1892
06:40:43,639 --> 06:40:49,479
Seven. That's cheap too. All right. Get rid of this. Where's Kane? Kane, come here.

1893
06:40:50,569 --> 06:41:01,939
Good day. Uh, Phylactery Lich. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. $50 they say. Derm of the Ridge is

1894
06:41:01,939 --> 06:41:22,150
fucking $75. It's quality. It's a quality product. This thing's made out of fucking steel. You can

1895
06:41:22,150 --> 06:41:38,099
get the same thing for $15. This thing's made out of fucking steel, guys. Does it protect against

1896
06:41:38,099 --> 06:42:00,740
card skimming? What a great question. What a great question. Seriously. It does. It has RFID blocking

1897
06:42:00,740 --> 06:42:21,500
inside of it. There you go. Blocks RFID. It doesn't do you taxes. It's also got an integrated

1898
06:42:21,500 --> 06:42:30,819
expandable track. Followed section of the wallet's pure metal plates. The T design of the track

1899
06:42:30,819 --> 06:42:35,060
secures cards from the bottom as well as the sides, so nothing accidentally falls out of the

1900
06:42:35,060 --> 06:42:41,270
bottom of the wallet. It'll snugly hold one card or expand to hold numerous cards. The track is

1901
06:42:41,270 --> 06:42:47,029
made out of a robust elastic material that has undergone several strength tests. It can expand

1902
06:42:47,029 --> 06:42:52,310
to hold up to 15 cards, and when the cards are removed, it will contract to hold a single card

1903
06:42:52,310 --> 06:42:58,389
securely with the most pure of fucking iron and aluminum metal and steel. And it's pure steel.

1904
06:42:58,389 --> 06:43:03,509
15 cards. Your actual, your local Walmart little compact wallet cannot hold 15 fucking cards

1905
06:43:03,509 --> 06:43:16,470
securely. Sorry. I'm sorry. That's completely incorrect. It was a sneaky way to do an ad.

1906
06:43:16,470 --> 06:43:30,520
Ad block isn't working. I like it. I like it. Nobody gave me. I like these things.

1907
06:43:31,029 --> 06:43:39,740
I like this thing. I like it. I like it. Next, you're going to send me like a review of that.

1908
06:43:39,740 --> 06:43:58,709
I can't piss in my Berkey. Okay. All right. Fine. That's fine. Whatever. Things made out of solid

1909
06:43:58,709 --> 06:44:04,650
fucking like carbon steel or something. I don't know. The Berkey, it's my water filter and

1910
06:44:04,650 --> 06:44:09,610
everybody made fun of me because I said it sucked, but they, you can clean, you literally take food

1911
06:44:09,610 --> 06:44:17,770
dye out of water. All right. I'm not even going to get started on that. What do you bring so I have?

1912
06:44:17,770 --> 06:44:39,689
Yeah. Oh, the water filter. Yeah. Let me go get the water filter. Let me go and pick up this clunky,

1913
06:44:39,689 --> 06:44:46,490
huge, hard to move around thing and bring it into this office. It quotes your office in the quotes.

1914
06:44:46,490 --> 06:44:52,250
Of course. Of course. I'm not going to go get a Berkey filter and filter as I'm no, I'm not doing

1915
06:44:52,250 --> 06:44:58,970
that. No, no. It's you know how hard that is to move over here. This thing's huge. It holds like

1916
06:44:58,970 --> 06:45:11,380
two gallons of water. What you get, what you want me to go get the Berkey filter and pour

1917
06:45:11,380 --> 06:45:16,439
chocolate milk in it and see what happens. I'm not going to do that. Find the YouTube channel

1918
06:45:16,439 --> 06:45:26,250
that already did. All right. Let's go pick some stats, please. If you could. Oh, there's still

1919
06:45:26,250 --> 06:45:53,509
time. Water filter stream. Why would that be cool? It would be me just drinking water. It would be

1920
06:45:53,509 --> 06:46:04,380
drinking water. What would, what's the, you want me to bring the Berkey up here and filter water

1921
06:46:04,380 --> 06:46:25,540
through it and then drink the water. Do you want me to tell you how it tastes? Yes. Doing a water

1922
06:46:25,540 --> 06:46:44,700
review for milk and coffee in it. I'm not going to ruin my water filter. No, it's that you want

1923
06:46:44,700 --> 06:46:53,159
to talk about expensive. It was expensive. It was like a hundred something dollars for the,

1924
06:46:53,720 --> 06:47:04,340
that is just thirsty. All right. We're putting this into decks. No. What have I, which one?

1925
06:47:04,900 --> 06:47:21,290
Come on, get a pick one. Just buy a new one. I'm, but what happened if you filtered Gatorade? I

1926
06:47:21,290 --> 06:47:34,139
don't know. I don't know. It would get clogged up and it would just be a waste. Let's find out.

1927
06:47:39,159 --> 06:47:42,279
It's not, this is not going to be as interesting as you guys think it is.

1928
06:47:42,840 --> 06:48:07,240
All right. We're doing vitality. What about skill point? Category, please. That's a worst stream of

1929
06:48:07,240 --> 06:48:22,180
the new decade. I guess I did build a bird house on stream. That's true. Yeah. I built a bird house.

1930
06:48:23,060 --> 06:48:33,580
I could filter fucking Gatorade. What a waste of time that's going to be. And then tell you

1931
06:48:33,580 --> 06:48:41,590
what happens. A hundred percent of you. All right. So what, what do you want me to click?

1932
06:48:41,590 --> 06:49:00,889
What do you want me to do? Oh, you want the fifth skeleton. Would you look at you guys picking

1933
06:49:00,889 --> 06:49:10,490
things that will help us through our journey? And then Bugleberry drinks it. And then he has

1934
06:49:10,490 --> 06:49:22,540
to give a review. Robust flavor, pure crystal water. All right. Let's get the next skeleton.

1935
06:49:23,180 --> 06:49:38,409
Thanks for voting vitality. 65 vitality. Kind of good to 15. All right. The,

1936
06:49:39,610 --> 06:49:56,360
we have five skeletons now. Finally, it only took a million years. This is a good charm.

1937
06:49:59,110 --> 06:50:03,110
Recovery and lightning resistance is very important. I'm going to save the rings.

1938
06:50:04,950 --> 06:50:11,259
No, because I'm going to, I don't need to tell you a fucking reason for everything that I do.

1939
06:50:12,139 --> 06:50:23,400
I have to tell you a reason for everything to explain everything I have to do. Wait,

1940
06:50:23,400 --> 06:50:30,020
how are you still alive? This is how I'll show you a few ways that this could have been a disaster.

1941
06:50:30,580 --> 06:50:36,180
This, if you, you could have just put every single point into this and I would have no

1942
06:50:36,180 --> 06:50:41,779
moves. Okay. Same with here. You could have put every point into bone wall. You could have put

1943
06:50:43,380 --> 06:50:47,860
every point into terror. I would simply have to run around and scream while I find a way to kill

1944
06:50:47,860 --> 06:50:57,380
them. I mean, even bone prison is some of these are bad. You could have put all your points into

1945
06:50:57,380 --> 06:51:03,459
golem mastery and put one point in clay golem and that's it. And then max out like skeletal mage

1946
06:51:03,459 --> 06:51:06,819
and it would have ruined everything. I don't give ideas. I'm just telling you,

1947
06:51:06,819 --> 06:51:22,819
you guys are doing a pretty good job. Everyone look at chat. I am. You think I'm not?

1948
06:51:25,139 --> 06:51:30,259
All right. We're looking for, let's get our new friend out here. We get five skeletons now.

1949
06:51:39,459 --> 06:51:50,900
The plan though is once you get more than 15, how was I going to say community subs?

1950
06:51:51,540 --> 06:51:59,610
When you get more than 15 community subs, you will start overwhelming. You will get,

1951
06:52:00,409 --> 06:52:15,509
that's when it's a, it's a battle. That's how you know, you've made it. How are you guys doing?

1952
06:52:15,509 --> 06:52:22,970
Are you guys doing good? You guys chilling? I'm just chilling. Oh, superior zombie head,

1953
06:52:22,970 --> 06:52:40,729
leave it. I've been looking for the maggot lair so I can hate my life. I want to keep playing.

1954
06:52:41,860 --> 06:52:44,819
You know, I really, I want to keep playing, but it's going to get, it's getting late.

1955
06:53:00,500 --> 06:53:06,020
Do this again tomorrow. Um, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

1956
06:53:06,659 --> 06:53:10,180
The reason why we did this today is because Bill was having computer problems today.

1957
06:53:10,900 --> 06:53:13,540
I was like, you know what? I thought about doing this a while ago and I'm going to just do it now.

1958
06:53:14,740 --> 06:53:18,180
I don't know what his schedule is like over the next couple of days, but we're probably going to

1959
06:53:18,180 --> 06:53:24,340
do keep talking. Nobody explodes. If not tomorrow, then the next day, we have that tomorrow,

1960
06:53:24,340 --> 06:53:27,779
the next day, whenever over the next few days, we just got to figure it out when his computer is

1961
06:53:28,900 --> 06:53:49,049
good to go to the filter screen tomorrow. Joel's streaming right now. Well, then that, that means,

1962
06:53:49,049 --> 06:54:11,580
that means he, that means he must've figured it out. Do a water filter test, test different water

1963
06:54:11,580 --> 06:54:35,930
filters. What a weird stream. Water filter test where I break down how, what the flavor of the

1964
06:54:35,930 --> 06:54:44,900
different water filters is. Pure, Brita, Ferkey. I mean, you're talking about as expensive jokes.

1965
06:54:48,439 --> 06:55:03,049
I mean, what am I going to do with them all? I guess I could donate them. What do you,

1966
06:55:03,049 --> 06:55:13,029
I don't know what I would do with them all. Did I not find them the maggot layer yet?

1967
06:55:22,490 --> 06:55:26,650
No, no. I mean, I'm, no, I'm talking about, guys, I'm not going to put anything like

1968
06:55:26,650 --> 06:55:36,490
fucked up in these filters. Let's see what happens when we filter orange juice. It's

1969
06:55:36,490 --> 06:55:51,220
going to come out as orange juice. It's just going to taste gross. How do you know? I don't know. I

1970
06:55:51,220 --> 06:56:06,650
don't know. I actually don't know the answer to this question. Where's this, where is it?

1971
06:56:06,650 --> 06:56:15,959
Where's the maggot layer under the far oasis? Come on, right here somewhere. You need to figure

1972
06:56:15,959 --> 06:56:43,180
this out. You have to be a scientist. Anybody see a little hole in the ground? No, I can't pee in

1973
06:56:43,180 --> 06:56:52,979
the Berkey. You do realize that if I, if I pee in the Berkey, I'm going to get banned from Twitch.

1974
06:56:54,470 --> 06:57:15,180
Even if I do this off camera, I'm gone. I'm, I'm gone. Let's go. I'm gone. Durma985,

1975
06:57:15,180 --> 06:57:20,939
so obsessed with proving to his loyal audience that the Berkey filter is legit,

1976
06:57:20,939 --> 06:57:27,819
he's in water filter on stream and drinks it to prove a point and then gets permanently suspended

1977
06:57:27,819 --> 06:57:45,419
from Twitch.tv and his partner status revoked. All right, where the hell is this place? It would be

1978
06:57:45,419 --> 06:58:11,189
infamous. Yes, sure. Oh, I hate running so slow. Dude, you would be a fucking legend. I don't give

1979
06:58:11,189 --> 06:58:21,290
a shit about being the guy that eat in the Berkey. Do you think I care more about that or being able

1980
06:58:21,290 --> 06:58:25,610
to like continue to stream and hang out and have fun and continue doing what I'm doing?

1981
06:58:27,659 --> 06:58:39,139
What do you think is more important to me right now? Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

1982
06:58:39,139 --> 06:58:45,779
hold on a minute. You're telling me that I can be the guy that pisses in a water filter and drinks

1983
06:58:45,779 --> 06:58:56,500
it. Everybody remembers me and laughs at that crazy thing I did. Oh, I lost all my partner status.

1984
06:58:58,779 --> 06:59:12,439
And eventually after that, I lose everything, every cent I own. The only reason why people

1985
06:59:12,520 --> 06:59:24,389
even talk about it is to laugh at me. Or I could have just played Diablo 2 and enjoyed myself.

1986
06:59:26,279 --> 06:59:32,200
No, good thing I pissed in that thing and one person every six months remembers me for 15

1987
06:59:32,200 --> 06:59:54,580
seconds. Yeah, it was me. It was me. Oh, man, those were the days. Grandpa, grandpa. Yeah,

1988
06:59:58,200 --> 07:00:10,150
grandpa. Wait, you're you're pissing Perry. Yeah, that's me. Wow. No way. Are you serious?

1989
07:00:10,950 --> 07:00:14,549
Yeah. I've seen so many top texts, bottom texts about you.

1990
07:00:18,220 --> 07:00:22,139
Wow, I can't believe that's so crazy. We were talking about you the other day for 15 seconds

1991
07:00:22,139 --> 07:00:28,020
and then didn't bring you up for like a year. Yeah, I lost out on like $7 million.

1992
07:00:28,020 --> 07:00:54,759
$7 million. Wow, cool. Cool, grandpa. Yeah, we saw you. We saw you in this funny meme compilation

1993
07:00:54,759 --> 07:01:06,790
video. I had 20 million views. Yeah, I don't get any of that money. I don't get any of that. Oh,

1994
07:01:06,790 --> 07:01:18,470
but you but people saw it. Yeah, they did. Oh, wait, you don't know. No, haven't seen a dime of

1995
07:01:18,470 --> 07:01:28,630
that one. Just pissing Perry. Son, do your grandfather a favor and go get him his favorite

1996
07:01:28,630 --> 07:01:46,540
Berkey. And grandson goes and gets it. He's like, Oh, this thing sticks. What's in there?

1997
07:01:49,340 --> 07:01:56,840
Yes. I've learned to love it. In fact, it was crazy because right after that stream,

1998
07:01:57,560 --> 07:02:11,959
I could never drink regular water again. All I could drink was filtered piss. So delicious.

1999
07:02:12,680 --> 07:02:29,080
Okay, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. The grandson has the youtuber voice because

2000
07:02:29,080 --> 07:03:04,299
the grandson is probably a youtuber. Found it. Two decks. Get out of here. Here it comes. Here comes

2001
07:03:04,299 --> 07:03:10,520
the end of here comes the end of the character. No, no, no, no, it's gonna be fine. This place

2002
07:03:10,520 --> 07:03:23,049
sucks notoriously. Let's just be real. We're getting arguments about stuff. Yeah, pissing

2003
07:03:23,049 --> 07:03:25,930
Perry over here. I can't he couldn't even figure out how to keep his channel going.

2004
07:03:26,889 --> 07:03:36,950
You don't even have 5000 subs on YouTube, you little shit. You know how many subs I had before

2005
07:03:36,950 --> 07:04:04,549
the great pissing of 2020? More than you'll ever have in your life, kid. And what I don't know is

2006
07:04:04,549 --> 07:04:12,540
he recorded that. The whole thing. And he uploaded it to his YouTube channel. And it got 20 million

2007
07:04:12,540 --> 07:04:27,020
views. And then he makes five videos after that. Talking about it and laughing about it. So all

2008
07:04:27,020 --> 07:04:34,069
of his YouTube friends, all of them, are making reaction videos to this. We're talking like six

2009
07:04:34,069 --> 07:04:39,270
to 700 million views across like 50 different channels. Pissing Perry just sits in his fucking

2010
07:04:39,270 --> 07:04:50,279
rocking chair. Doesn't see a dime. Doesn't see a dime. Get over here, everybody. Come on.

2011
07:04:59,459 --> 07:05:13,430
Don't get stuck. If anyone's gonna get stuck, it's gonna be one of you. No. Come on, Vic. He's okay.

2012
07:05:14,150 --> 07:05:26,860
He's doing all right. He's actually pretty good. Who thought this was gonna end here?

2013
07:05:26,860 --> 07:05:37,580
You were wrong. We're good. How many people we got? We got many more. All right, we got

2014
07:05:37,580 --> 07:05:47,380
eight, nine, we got 10 companions. It's not gonna end here. It just sucks because it takes forever.

2015
07:05:48,020 --> 07:05:52,900
This is why if I was a sorceress, I could just right click and do frozen orb and just walk forward.

2016
07:05:53,779 --> 07:06:01,209
Tell us more about how you love. When did I say I love doing that?

2017
07:06:02,169 --> 07:06:12,250
All right, I'm not gonna get justification for why I can pee into a Berkey on stream.

2018
07:06:12,250 --> 07:06:18,330
No, I don't know who did it. I don't know who drank pee already. I'm no, hey, hey, you know,

2019
07:06:18,330 --> 07:06:24,090
this guy drank pee already. That's okay. That's fine. Oh, good for you. Good for whoever that

2020
07:06:24,090 --> 07:06:32,659
was. I'm not gonna drink piss on stream. You're trying to somehow justify me being able to drink

2021
07:06:32,659 --> 07:06:45,299
pee on this stream. No, no, no, no, no, no. Are you serious? Are we actually talking about that?

2022
07:06:45,299 --> 07:07:07,619
You can't be serious. Bear Grylls did it. He didn't even use a filter. Yes, he did. He buried it into

2023
07:07:07,619 --> 07:07:11,139
the ground. He peed in the ground and buried it and then the soil sucked up the fucking

2024
07:07:12,419 --> 07:07:16,259
ammonia that's in the piss. He was clean and whatever. I don't know. I saw like a,

2025
07:07:16,259 --> 07:07:30,810
I've watched that like a year. All right, we're gonna have to have important people up here. Put

2026
07:07:30,810 --> 07:07:43,419
people in front. This isn't gonna take forever. That's fine. Just stuff everybody up here. Come

2027
07:07:43,419 --> 07:07:51,369
on. Push through. He's thought about this already. No, Bear Grylls peed into the ground. He dug a

2028
07:07:51,369 --> 07:07:56,900
hole and he peed into it and he waited like three days or something. And then when he opened up the

2029
07:07:56,900 --> 07:08:02,810
hole, the pee was clean. Something like that happened. Something like that happened. I don't

2030
07:08:02,810 --> 07:08:07,930
know. Something weird like that. What was it? I'm telling you. It was like there was pee in the

2031
07:08:07,930 --> 07:08:14,680
ground and it was like he buried it. And on the third day his piss rose. Nothing like that happened.

2032
07:08:14,680 --> 07:08:26,900
What? That was one episode. Yes, I know. Why do people think I'm crazy? I swear to God this happened.

2033
07:08:41,560 --> 07:08:51,049
Jett is so dumb is what somebody said. No, he did not do that. He did not pee.

2034
07:08:54,310 --> 07:09:00,330
He did not pee up. He's such a shitty survival technique.

2035
07:09:01,209 --> 07:09:11,430
Imagine telling somebody to just sit down in the air. No, that's not how you survive.

2036
07:09:11,430 --> 07:09:32,459
That didn't happen. All right, we need. Where's my blood going? Get in there. Get in there and cause

2037
07:09:32,459 --> 07:09:39,189
a mayhem. You need to cause a mayhem. Turn around. What are you getting? See the person behind you?

2038
07:09:39,189 --> 07:09:57,130
Spaghetti. Turn around Mr. Spaghetti. All right, now you're in the way. What year is this? I knew

2039
07:09:57,130 --> 07:10:02,490
that was going to piss so many people off. I knew that was going to just piss like a thousand people

2040
07:10:02,490 --> 07:10:25,029
off. The second they heard the gay was just like, no, shut up. Dream is dehydrated.

2041
07:10:26,869 --> 07:10:49,669
Don't worry. I'll take care of that in a minute. 17 max stamina. Nice, man. Pretty cool. Nice.

2042
07:10:49,669 --> 07:10:55,459
Actually, I'm starting to lose my mind. Whatever. It's the maggot layer. It does it to you.

2043
07:10:59,610 --> 07:11:13,849
You are making me want some water though. What's your guys favorite water?

2044
07:11:14,569 --> 07:11:25,580
Favorite like bottle of water. Am I a rich asshole if I say Fiji? No, a lot of people are saying it.

2045
07:11:26,139 --> 07:11:31,930
A lot of people are saying it. No, a lot of people are saying it. I saw like at least a

2046
07:11:31,930 --> 07:11:46,520
hundred people say it. Guys, Fiji is filtered with rocks. It naturally gets filtered over the

2047
07:11:46,520 --> 07:12:12,650
sediment of the rocks. Now you're going to tell me that's fake too. Don't die. You're going to be

2048
07:12:12,650 --> 07:12:30,150
in front of me. No, I'm not talking about every day. I'm talking about just like sometimes.

2049
07:12:31,860 --> 07:12:37,400
Sometimes I'll see it and I go, you know what? That sounds good. This isn't every day.

2050
07:12:44,819 --> 07:12:50,419
Drink smart water then. I don't think you want to say that. I think you just angered a lot of

2051
07:12:50,419 --> 07:12:55,459
people. I don't know what it is but for some reason if you don't drink water out of your tap

2052
07:12:57,419 --> 07:13:06,659
and you say, I like this. Careful. Like if you don't turn your bathtub on and turn your head

2053
07:13:06,659 --> 07:13:15,939
over and drink out of the bathtub apparently you're a crazy person. Are you guys drinking out of a

2054
07:13:15,939 --> 07:13:25,770
garden hose? Yeah, seriously. No, you know, I don't drink tap water. It has fluorine in it. I don't

2055
07:13:25,770 --> 07:13:49,659
want that. No, I clicked an ad one time and it told me that I don't want fluorine. I was like,

2056
07:13:49,659 --> 07:14:03,750
all right. I don't want that. I stopped buying it. Stop drinking it. This place sucks. It really

2057
07:14:03,750 --> 07:14:24,310
does. Will somebody get up there? I'm so glad I have these mages. I need potions. All right.

2058
07:14:24,310 --> 07:14:46,619
15. Just stick it in there. Whatever. Not a bad thing. I mean L runes, they drop like rain.

2059
07:14:46,619 --> 07:14:56,360
It'd be fine. Yeah, just whatever. I'm going to do it. That's 15 plus. There's more defense

2060
07:14:56,360 --> 07:15:06,020
and light radius. It's fine. I did level up but I have to get to the end of this. I bet that's

2061
07:15:06,020 --> 07:15:17,139
damaged. My tap water is hard water and it's awful tasting. Yes, I agree. Vegas has really hard water.

2062
07:15:18,099 --> 07:15:40,540
It smells like rust. You got hard water too. Yeah, that's why this filter exists. You don't

2063
07:15:40,540 --> 07:15:57,340
want to, you know, I don't, I don't want to drink rust. German misses the East Coast.

2064
07:16:02,099 --> 07:16:05,939
I'm not sure I necessarily would have wanted to drink that much tap water in Massachusetts either.

2065
07:16:07,060 --> 07:16:10,340
I don't think Massachusetts has very good water. I'm pretty sure it ranks kind of low.

2066
07:16:11,299 --> 07:16:24,020
I'm pretty sure tap water in Boston is really not that great.

2067
07:16:25,380 --> 07:16:40,419
Go dig a hole if you want clean water. I need more mages. Here we go. Here comes the fun part

2068
07:16:40,419 --> 07:16:51,860
where we sit here while a hundred flies get stuck in the wall. Is anybody even up there?

2069
07:16:51,860 --> 07:17:09,340
All right, I'm going to put you up here. Get in there. Fight. Nice aim play. It's at this point

2070
07:17:09,340 --> 07:17:19,270
that I will agree with you. These guys are immune to physical damage. That's why. I've got a guy

2071
07:17:19,270 --> 07:17:35,799
immune to physical. That sucks. The mages have to kill this guy. Oh, he loved that one.

2072
07:17:35,799 --> 07:18:00,790
Come on, mages. Get him. All right. I made it through. All right. All right. Okay. Okay.

2073
07:18:00,790 --> 07:18:16,299
Let's get some more mages. All right. Kill moonbiting. Jesus. I get two hits.

2074
07:18:18,139 --> 07:18:47,819
I got to sell. Hey, I can make one. And four to seven cold damage. Oh, man. Nice.

2075
07:18:48,619 --> 07:19:01,990
That's three rings, right? To make an amulet. Yes, it is. Filter tier list. How does that even work?

2076
07:19:01,990 --> 07:19:32,099
It's like five. I got to get a bunch of these. I am starting to run out of mana. All right. Let

2077
07:19:32,099 --> 07:19:42,619
me get through the maggot layer and then we can do points. Yeah. Level three is probably up here.

2078
07:19:44,439 --> 07:19:54,419
Yeah. If I was a sorceress and I had teleport, you know, I really just wish I was a sorceress,

2079
07:19:54,419 --> 07:20:11,770
to be honest. Who had a sword? Oh, fuck. You're right. Well, you're not. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2080
07:20:16,459 --> 07:20:34,090
Not as good. Not as good. Kind of sucks. If you had teleport, you would teleport into death.

2081
07:20:35,209 --> 07:20:43,930
Also kind of true. It is. Yeah, I would teleport into a bunch of enemies and die.

2082
07:20:45,610 --> 07:20:57,779
Link vessel notice. I saw the tier list. David, I do tier list all the time.

2083
07:20:58,500 --> 07:21:10,459
I'm not going to do it right now. Come on. Just get me to the next level.

2084
07:21:12,759 --> 07:21:16,650
Claw of Fire for Temple is actually going to be painful. It's not in here either. Shit.

2085
07:21:17,450 --> 07:21:36,409
Let me in. Let me in. What tier is hose water? Of all the tap water, hose water is probably up

2086
07:21:36,409 --> 07:21:51,240
pretty high. I would say. There's something about taking a hose that's turned on and tilting it so

2087
07:21:51,240 --> 07:21:58,459
it makes that arcing fountain and just putting your mouth up and they really can't be beat. I

2088
07:21:58,459 --> 07:22:11,750
would put that pretty high on the list. Hose water is dangerous. Why? Hose water can kill you.

2089
07:22:16,759 --> 07:22:33,099
Does bacteria and mold in it. What's with all the Debbie Downers? I have a Berkey.

2090
07:22:33,740 --> 07:22:39,020
Berkey suck. Not even real. I love drinking out of a hose on a hot summer day. It's going to kill

2091
07:22:39,020 --> 07:23:09,099
you. Bananas are my favorite fruit. Radioactive gross. I got this ridge wallet. Oh shit. Too

2092
07:23:09,099 --> 07:23:34,810
expensive. It is. But still, an honest shill. No, I was a shill in my dream, but I was not

2093
07:23:34,810 --> 07:23:52,490
a shill in real life for that. Hold on a second. Am I getting told? How many, let's be honest,

2094
07:23:52,490 --> 07:23:56,900
how many of you guys do vape? How many of you guys have a jewel in your pocket right now?

2095
07:24:02,540 --> 07:24:10,810
I know a lot of you do. I know you can get pneumonia from fucking vaping. You know that,

2096
07:24:10,810 --> 07:24:45,380
right? Fake news. I stopped, okay? Good. Everyone thinks his fan base is all Zoomers. Well,

2097
07:24:45,380 --> 07:24:49,540
considering how many of you guys didn't know the game I was playing until about two hours ago,

2098
07:24:49,540 --> 07:25:04,580
yeah, sometimes. Don't run forward here. This is bad. This is a boss in here.

2099
07:25:05,459 --> 07:25:20,549
It's the 1999 Zoomers. Are you a Zoomer if you're 1999? What's the cutoff here?

2100
07:25:21,110 --> 07:25:27,990
I thought it was like 97 or something. Like 96. What's the cutoff here? Yeah, it's 97, isn't it?

2101
07:25:28,790 --> 07:25:44,970
96 is probably the cutoff. You guys get such an interesting

2102
07:25:45,849 --> 07:25:55,659
childhood. Think of all the stuff that's been developed in the last 15 years. I mean, we went

2103
07:25:55,659 --> 07:26:03,880
from, I went from like the regular Nintendo to cell phones, but the cell phones were kind of shitty.

2104
07:26:03,880 --> 07:26:11,479
You know what I'm saying? We got iPhones. We got like, I was going to say Google Stadia,

2105
07:26:12,279 --> 07:26:17,080
but that would be not, that's not a very good, that's not a very good thing to say for a tech,

2106
07:26:17,959 --> 07:26:23,400
but I don't know why I was going to say Stadia. You know, we've got cell phones. We've got Stadia

2107
07:26:23,400 --> 07:26:42,220
now. Like, that's such a big deal. No, Google, this is a long play for Google, guys. I know

2108
07:26:42,220 --> 07:26:48,229
Google makes a product and then pretends it doesn't exist like two years later, but really

2109
07:26:49,610 --> 07:26:59,700
there, I'm going to die. Fine. They are waiting for when the internet is a hundred times better

2110
07:26:59,700 --> 07:27:05,580
than it is now, but they can be the first people that has the streaming video game console

2111
07:27:05,580 --> 07:27:10,790
in 30 years. We've heard this before. We've heard you say this before. Yeah, but not everyone was

2112
07:27:10,790 --> 07:27:31,270
here. This could be completely different audience. All right, this is it. Get everybody in here.

2113
07:27:31,270 --> 07:27:39,529
Respawn everybody. Get up here. He ran into things to say. Listen, I never run into things to say.

2114
07:27:40,409 --> 07:28:04,549
I can talk all day. We know, we know. He kind of ruined my thing. I was going to not talk for like

2115
07:28:04,549 --> 07:28:25,930
five minutes. He spent an hour talking about expensive water. It's expensive water. Sorry,

2116
07:28:25,930 --> 07:28:33,560
the term is airport water. Airport water. Come on. Why do you drink at the airport?

2117
07:28:34,119 --> 07:29:06,979
Okay, watch out. All right. Low and slow, low and slow, low and slow. Like a pot roast. Good.

2118
07:29:08,919 --> 07:29:10,919
Oh man, there's so many people in here. All right. I need more

2119
07:29:12,740 --> 07:29:24,099
Mano. Big mommy bug. That's right. Eggs everywhere and shit. This is why this place sucks.

2120
07:29:24,979 --> 07:29:32,279
Ring. Come on, give me something better than that. If I didn't have all these people,

2121
07:29:32,279 --> 07:29:39,130
can you imagine this is solo, right? Imagine if 40 or 50 things were shooting at me at the same time.

2122
07:30:02,299 --> 07:30:10,279
All right, immune to cold and all of my majors are cold. So that's good.

2123
07:30:16,790 --> 07:30:27,819
Done. Staff of Kings. I remember when I first played this game with friends a long time ago.

2124
07:30:29,319 --> 07:30:34,900
I mean, it's not a terrible, very fast attack speed. It's two-handed, but I remember a friend

2125
07:30:34,900 --> 07:30:40,569
of mine used this. They had this equipped for a very long time and they didn't realize

2126
07:30:41,610 --> 07:30:47,979
they were running around with this thing on. And I had to try to tell them that that's not what it,

2127
07:30:47,979 --> 07:30:53,610
you don't use this thing. It's part of a, it's the thing is though, it's really pretty good.

2128
07:30:53,610 --> 07:31:05,060
Look at how fast the swings for a two-hander. That's really great. But they used it for a long

2129
07:31:05,060 --> 07:31:15,560
time and they couldn't figure out how to get out of act two. Why not use it because you have to

2130
07:31:15,560 --> 07:31:37,080
get rid of it to get out of act two and quotes his friend and that person. Oh, let's make a,

2131
07:31:37,080 --> 07:31:50,869
let's make an amulet. That's funny that you can use it at all. You can use the hammer too from act

2132
07:31:50,869 --> 07:32:03,700
one. Can we take a pee break? You can take a pee break when I level up again, cause it'll be about

2133
07:32:03,700 --> 07:32:09,819
five straight minutes of us picking stuff. So you'll have that opportunity very soon.

2134
07:32:11,909 --> 07:32:18,599
Old resist is more important than magic fine right now. Cause it's burial 59 old resist.

2135
07:32:21,500 --> 07:32:28,869
All right. We're almost there. Almost at Daryl. Please. I have to go so bad. We'll just,

2136
07:32:28,869 --> 07:32:57,209
just go. It's okay. You guys are good. All right. Now we need the, uh, the head, which is in the,

2137
07:32:57,209 --> 07:33:05,000
the, it's a little bit further out. It's the last one. Did I get the far always this waypoint?

2138
07:33:05,000 --> 07:33:27,860
I don't remember. I did not. I think we're going to ask them. All right. We're going to go through,

2139
07:33:27,860 --> 07:33:33,240
we got to do, we got to do some running here. You can go now. You could actually go now.

2140
07:33:34,040 --> 07:34:08,119
We got running to do our ways and we're looking for Valley of the snakes. Don't make any plus

2141
07:34:08,119 --> 07:34:14,259
two jokes while I'm away. All right. I won't. All right. See you in a minute.

2142
07:34:14,259 --> 07:34:38,470
Hey, thanks for the, thanks for the three. Thanks for the free stock market bump.

2143
07:34:41,459 --> 07:34:54,810
What's with the strange darkness? Must find the valley of the snakes. Plus two omega lulam

2144
07:34:55,369 --> 07:35:02,040
dying. What have you were? What have you were though? Like what have you were?

2145
07:35:02,759 --> 07:35:13,430
What if you were laughing so hard? All right. Don't be a dickhead.

2146
07:35:13,830 --> 07:35:25,159
All right. I got to ask this dude bedtime. That's pretty early. I'm just, I just want to,

2147
07:35:25,159 --> 07:35:49,209
I'm just playing it. I just love this game. We're going on eight hours. I know, but I mean,

2148
07:35:49,209 --> 07:35:53,290
it might not be everybody's cup of tea right now, but I mean, I really do love this game.

2149
07:35:57,689 --> 07:36:00,650
It's just so funny. I'm glad you guys got to participate.

2150
07:36:13,509 --> 07:36:19,900
Should enjoy what you're playing. Yeah. So, so this, the rest of the week for like the next

2151
07:36:19,900 --> 07:36:34,020
five days in a row, only this. All right. Thanks. Yeah. Cool. Thanks. Thanks for permission. Yes.

2152
07:36:34,819 --> 07:36:45,220
It's taken a lot longer to kill things though. That's sort of, that's starting to concern me a

2153
07:36:45,220 --> 07:36:53,099
little, just a little getting a small amount of concern and how long it's taking me to kill

2154
07:36:53,099 --> 07:37:09,689
anyone. You got two levels up. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Oh, there's an ancient tunnel here.

2155
07:37:09,689 --> 07:37:28,729
There could be a chest. Who cares? Oh, can I go up? Yes. This is still on hardcore.

2156
07:37:28,729 --> 07:37:53,880
I've not given up on that one yet. It's the price for a wink at 75,000 channel points.

2157
07:37:53,880 --> 07:38:06,520
Alley of the snakes. Come on. I'm going to sneak. Don't kill me by a trap. That would be,

2158
07:38:06,520 --> 07:38:08,919
that would be, I'm going to sneeze. I can't pay attention. I'm going to sneeze.

2159
07:38:09,799 --> 07:38:26,380
I promise that was real. All right. Where the hell am I? I don't have any anecdotes.

2160
07:38:37,020 --> 07:39:28,279
Kill something. Will somebody die? Somebody die to the wink. Thanks for the free wink.

2161
07:39:28,279 --> 07:39:40,680
Yeah. You go. I'm devaluing the winks by accidentally giving up free winks. That's not good.

2162
07:39:41,319 --> 07:40:05,319
Alley of the snakes. I don't want to influence the vote or anything, but I'm going to say this as a,

2163
07:40:05,400 --> 07:40:09,080
I'm going to say the first letter of each word that I'm trying to tell you.

2164
07:40:13,110 --> 07:41:02,819
I W L I Y E 2 P I S M. That's his wifi password. It's DaVinci code. Shit. Where's this loss?

2165
07:41:02,819 --> 07:41:08,659
No, where's the valley of the snakes? I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need it. I need

2166
07:41:08,659 --> 07:41:16,090
it. I want to filter some water and also review the filters on stream and then maybe pee in the

2167
07:41:16,090 --> 07:41:33,770
filters. Not quite. Not, not really that close. Try again and then maybe drink the filters.

2168
07:41:35,799 --> 07:41:41,560
Where's this? I need a valley. I thought it was up here. I'm wrong. That was not it.

2169
07:41:44,180 --> 07:41:52,549
Honestly, that was so long ago. I didn't even know what it was. I lived my life in dog years, guys.

2170
07:41:55,290 --> 07:42:00,490
Like one year is seven years for a dog. It's kind of the same way. Like one minute is like 45 minutes

2171
07:42:00,490 --> 07:42:31,270
for me in my brain. Wait, six sockets. Let's go. Actually, these sell for a lot. I can gamble.

2172
07:42:43,590 --> 07:42:50,259
Valley of the snakes. Looking for valley of the snake. Just want to find it.

2173
07:42:57,689 --> 07:43:02,409
Oh God. Don't let this be the end. Don't let this be the end. Don't let this be the end. Don't

2174
07:43:02,409 --> 07:43:18,360
let this be the end. Yeah, these sell for, look at how much these sell for. Let's go gamble.

2175
07:43:18,360 --> 07:43:44,459
Just tuned in. Is it the end? No, not yet. I'm, I'm still all right. I'm still chilling.

2176
07:43:45,259 --> 07:43:55,419
The stream has been chill enough where it's not like I'm like exhausted right now. I still got my

2177
07:43:55,419 --> 07:44:04,619
guy. Yeah, we'll level up too. Some gambling. I need, what's the worst thing I have? I need boots.

2178
07:44:05,419 --> 07:44:10,779
Boots in an offhand or something. Boots. These boots are so bad. These are like level three.

2179
07:44:12,630 --> 07:44:39,860
Level three boots. I could probably get a better weapon too. They're better. Not by very much,

2180
07:44:39,860 --> 07:45:01,459
but they are. Ooh. Magic find is crazy good in this game. Once you cross one to 200% magic find,

2181
07:45:02,700 --> 07:45:13,979
rares, sets, and uniques drop all the fucking time. I'll wear them. I'll put a better helm.

2182
07:45:13,979 --> 07:45:30,939
Yeah. Try to get a helmet. Here we go. Two sockets. 22, 25. Hold resist.

2183
07:45:33,099 --> 07:45:44,040
I could put some stuff in. There's two sockets in here. Do you want to try for something else?

2184
07:45:44,680 --> 07:46:11,659
Maybe a weapon. This thing's level six. Oh, it's gotta be one-handed. One-handed. Three to 19.

2185
07:46:17,930 --> 07:46:23,159
What are you guys talking about? My job after streaming? What do you mean? I don't like turn

2186
07:46:23,159 --> 07:46:31,139
off the stream and go to work. What? Wait, is he going to go to his job that led to today?

2187
07:46:39,049 --> 07:46:51,740
He's not relatable. What do you mean I'm not relatable? 12. All right. No more. All right,

2188
07:46:51,740 --> 07:46:59,849
that's it. These all suck. Last one. Terrible. Terrible. Let's go. All right. I got 10 points

2189
07:46:59,849 --> 07:47:02,490
to put in. Where do you want me to put them? Take a look at what we have so far. Remember,

2190
07:47:02,490 --> 07:47:09,290
strength is damage and gear. Dexterity is attack rating, hit chance, defense, health, stamina,

2191
07:47:10,009 --> 07:47:22,150
just mana. That's all it does. He got fired. No, I've actually never been fired from a job in my life

2192
07:47:22,150 --> 07:47:33,799
because it never happened. All right. Where do you want to put 10 points? Take a look. Which one?

2193
07:47:33,799 --> 07:47:43,849
You're going to get fired from streaming if I pee in a filter on stream.

2194
07:47:44,650 --> 07:48:00,009
So yeah, we'll make it one out of one. All right. So it seems like now we're actively trying to

2195
07:48:00,009 --> 07:48:13,259
fuck up the whole thing. Okay. I mean, this is what if you guys want to do, but I'm an engineering

2196
07:48:13,259 --> 07:48:35,500
school. What are you talking about? Engineering school. All right. Five, four, three, two, one.

2197
07:48:35,500 --> 07:48:41,270
Dexterity. It is 10 points into dexterity. I might as well pick up a bow if you're going to do that

2198
07:48:41,270 --> 07:49:03,060
shit. You're not having enough meltdown, so it's all has to go into dex. Aye, aye, aye. All right.

2199
07:49:03,060 --> 07:49:06,979
Take a look. This is what we've got so far. Remember, blue means it's being, there's plus

2200
07:49:06,979 --> 07:49:14,569
skills on it. So if you like, what the fuck is that blue, dude? We have two points to spend.

2201
07:49:14,650 --> 07:49:33,770
There are two points that we can spend. I don't want to influence the vote at all, but you know,

2202
07:49:33,770 --> 07:49:44,200
we have poison of bone. Here are the curses. You know where they are. Bone wall. It already has two

2203
07:49:44,200 --> 07:49:53,189
points in it. All right. Where do you want to go? First point. Pick a category on the right. Bone

2204
07:49:53,189 --> 07:50:56,200
wall. You already fucked up his dex. Yes, they did. Okay. Summoning. Hmm. Better skeletons.

2205
07:50:56,200 --> 07:51:09,509
Skeleton mastery. Is that where you guys are going? Okay. What about point number two?

2206
07:51:09,509 --> 07:51:13,750
What about point number two? Please pick a category on the right if you want to pick a new

2207
07:51:13,750 --> 07:51:26,419
one. You know, I'm sorry I just hit you in the mouth. Don't get mad at me. I guess you don't

2208
07:51:26,419 --> 07:51:34,580
want to pick a category. We'll just choose, okay. Nobody wants to pick a new category. They want to

2209
07:51:34,580 --> 07:52:01,819
stay right here. So we're going double skeleton mastery. Okay. All right. I may have done it a

2210
07:52:01,819 --> 07:52:07,779
little differently, you know, if it were me playing. For me playing. But you know, going from,

2211
07:52:08,740 --> 07:52:12,500
you know, increasing life and damage. Let's say for instance, 13 to 14 damage.

2212
07:52:13,860 --> 07:52:21,540
16 to 17. Bank again. Skeleton mastery again. 19 to 20 damage. And they'll live longer. They

2213
07:52:21,540 --> 07:52:26,889
have higher defense. I mean, it's not a terrible play. I don't think. This is the same build you

2214
07:52:26,889 --> 07:52:46,279
were going to make anyways. No, it is not. Some of this is all wrong. We don't know. We don't know.

2215
07:52:46,279 --> 07:52:59,459
We don't know anything about the game. Okay. Cool. Tell us what you would like so we can avoid it.

2216
07:53:00,500 --> 07:53:06,259
Well, I said skeleton mastery was better. And everybody clicked it. We want to have what's up

2217
07:53:06,259 --> 07:53:25,860
to you. Hey, how do I oceans are all right. Snakes. Holy shit. What happened here? Oh, right,

2218
07:53:25,860 --> 07:53:30,819
right, right, right. Okay. Yeah, I panicked and left. I forgot about this.

2219
07:53:31,619 --> 07:53:57,590
I forgot about this. Oh, heal him, heal him, heal him. You can drop a potion on companions

2220
07:53:57,590 --> 07:54:01,830
and heal them. I just didn't do it to Kyle because I didn't care because he was like level five.

2221
07:54:01,830 --> 07:54:04,869
We were fighting with level 15 enemies. So it was not even worth doing that.

2222
07:54:20,619 --> 07:54:49,290
Still no Valley. Is that a little spot up there? Did I miss a spot up here? Am I crazy? Yep. It's

2223
07:54:49,290 --> 07:54:57,159
actually probably right over here. You missed a spot. Alt tab and turn off your computer.

2224
07:54:57,880 --> 07:55:03,270
One of these days, somebody is going to say something like that and I'm just going to do it.

2225
07:55:03,270 --> 07:55:32,889
But no, no skeletons are dying. Please. I'm stuck here. What happened? What do you mean?

2226
07:55:32,889 --> 07:55:47,240
He's stuck here. How is it possible to be stuck in that chair? Did you, are you like,

2227
07:55:49,159 --> 07:56:16,729
are you like bare ass sitting on a wet piece of ice? What happened? There it is. There it is.

2228
07:56:16,729 --> 07:56:49,189
There it is. Found it. Found it. Found it. Found it. Yeah. I miss Frank. Yeah. We don't have any

2229
07:56:49,189 --> 07:56:54,819
dead rising friends. How would we just, I just played that like a month or two ago.

2230
07:57:03,560 --> 07:57:10,819
We don't have any dead rising friends. Friends. Is that what I said? I'm going to beat Darryl

2231
07:57:10,819 --> 07:57:38,759
first try and then I'm going to alt tab my computer. Ooh. I think that this is a quick one.

2232
07:57:38,759 --> 07:57:50,419
It's just right on level two. Oh no. I feel the arcane sanctuary forgot. We can't just skip that

2233
07:57:50,419 --> 07:58:15,900
part. Arcane sanctuary is so bad. Look at five, three. Yeah. Look at this. Look at how much these

2234
07:58:15,900 --> 07:58:24,180
guys are staying alive now. There's so much beef here. We can increase their potential by 40%

2235
07:58:25,740 --> 07:58:39,639
overnight. Overnight. Easy. All right. Everyone get in there. All right. Here comes the battle.

2236
07:58:40,439 --> 07:59:01,819
What's my hit chance on these guys? I'm curious. 95%. Okay. That seems way higher than I thought

2237
07:59:01,819 --> 07:59:20,419
it was. No level two in here. Bone mage gang. I think it's pretty much all bone. All bone gang.

2238
07:59:21,459 --> 07:59:31,099
Not just mages. There's random hell. Tonight I'm going to sleep. Well, maybe we'll see it tomorrow

2239
07:59:31,740 --> 07:59:42,360
or the next day or whenever. Have a good sleep. Period. Two hit a sword. Hold on.

2240
07:59:44,540 --> 08:00:08,740
It's 17. Two sockets. Crash. Plus two to weaken. No, crash. It's in there. First kill it.

2241
08:00:09,619 --> 08:00:31,369
Worth using? No. It's probably right here. I always hate when it's right next to the door.

2242
08:00:43,669 --> 08:00:50,069
I have to train them around. I'm going to get stuck on somebody.

2243
08:00:50,709 --> 08:01:30,759
Hmm. It could have ended very badly. How do I hate gold? Um, no. Ask him. Deflect him.

2244
08:01:30,759 --> 08:01:55,639
Sometimes there's so many people in them. Get in. Get in. Why does your mouth taste like blood?

2245
08:01:56,889 --> 08:02:01,959
Because you bit your lip. You're chewing too fast and you're trying to eat your food too quickly.

2246
08:02:03,080 --> 08:02:58,680
Slow down. The drank from the 5G garden hose. All right. Level two is very quick. Right here.

2247
08:02:58,680 --> 08:03:09,959
No, it's not. I thought it was right around the corner. It's not. How long is the stream going to

2248
08:03:09,959 --> 08:03:19,930
be? Um, I don't know. I don't know. Probably not that much longer. I don't think. Probably not

2249
08:03:19,930 --> 08:03:29,610
much longer. But I, I, I got addicted to Diablo 2. Which I kind of knew this was going to happen.

2250
08:03:30,330 --> 08:03:53,189
Let's go. Right to the end. Oh, is it not over here? Seems impossible. It's right on there.

2251
08:03:53,189 --> 08:03:58,380
Again, see, look at this. Look at the RNG I'm getting here. It's in the one spot again

2252
08:03:58,380 --> 08:04:11,669
that I didn't look. The one place. He's not going to be able to play D2 online with us.

2253
08:04:13,849 --> 08:04:27,180
Um, well, not with this character, but, and I don't, yeah. What does a Vic have for armor?

2254
08:04:27,180 --> 08:04:33,750
Actually, I don't think anything. Actually nothing. So, um, just here. Put this on.

2255
08:04:34,630 --> 08:04:51,560
The skeletons are us. Yeah. Think of it that way. I still seriously can't believe I got fucking banned

2256
08:04:51,560 --> 08:04:56,810
from this game. I don't think I've ever been banned from my whole life. All right. Be careful

2257
08:04:56,810 --> 08:05:02,090
here. This is, this is danger. I've never been banned from a fucking video game ever. I never

2258
08:05:02,090 --> 08:05:09,819
had any problems. I got banned from Diablo 2. All right. Okay. This is actually slow down.

2259
08:05:10,459 --> 08:05:27,939
They can run up on you real quick. This place on any, on a higher difficulty than normal,

2260
08:05:27,939 --> 08:05:38,549
it's hell. It's so bad. I've been spawn camped in this room on hell and had to restart the game

2261
08:05:38,549 --> 08:06:01,860
like more than three or four times. Isn't this game hell though? I mean, yeah. There he is.

2262
08:06:01,939 --> 08:06:18,630
Bang skin. Get. We've completed the staff. Here's the amulet. The amulet.

2263
08:06:23,180 --> 08:06:28,330
Amulet of Kings. Ten life, ten mana poison resistance.

2264
08:06:28,330 --> 08:06:33,159
I thought we were going to turn into the staff anyways.

2265
08:06:37,220 --> 08:06:44,419
Time to die. Die. Time to die. Die. How do I do that? When is it again?

2266
08:06:44,500 --> 08:07:00,520
Time to die. Time to die. Die. Time to die. Help. Help me. Help. Help me. This is for you.

2267
08:07:00,520 --> 08:07:13,159
Where is it? Run. Help. There it is. Help me. Help me. Help. Me. Me.

2268
08:07:23,180 --> 08:07:43,270
I know all the voice lines from samurai warriors to empires. All right. The horodric staff.

2269
08:07:44,229 --> 08:07:48,090
Excellent. You have horodric staff.

2270
08:08:00,220 --> 08:08:03,740
I can now go to the castle. The castle? The palace castle.

2271
08:08:09,400 --> 08:08:21,720
Let's get some actual armor and weapons for this guy. How about a trident? Trident? Yeah.

2272
08:08:23,750 --> 08:08:29,400
And a regular shitty helmet. And that's fine.

2273
08:08:35,080 --> 08:08:41,240
3096. That's pretty good, actually. We're going to talk to

2274
08:08:42,360 --> 08:08:56,380
Brogdan. The potions are fine. This path of exile is similar to this. I would say very.

2275
08:08:57,020 --> 08:09:04,900
The path of exile is a little newer. This is pretty dated. It still does very, very well.

2276
08:09:04,900 --> 08:09:11,060
Still holds up very well. Somebody said they bet 50 channel points that I die to the arcane dudes.

2277
08:09:11,860 --> 08:09:23,479
Researching the old records. Trying to find the location of Tal Rasha's tomb. Only 50?

2278
08:09:26,459 --> 08:09:31,669
I may have a good lead for you. Great Viserai Summoner. Yeah. I'm going to go to the.

2279
08:09:31,669 --> 08:09:38,150
Build a summoner. Find a. I hate this part. Look in the arc. Look for the arcane sanctuary

2280
08:09:38,150 --> 08:10:01,930
within the palace. I do have a lot of friends, though. Builds to join me within the safety of

2281
08:10:01,930 --> 08:10:11,540
the palace. All was fine until one night. All right. Get the staff into Tal Rasha's tomb.

2282
08:10:11,540 --> 08:10:21,639
Find Tal Rasha's tomb. Here we go. Who do you hate more, Vinny or Joel?

2283
08:10:22,680 --> 08:10:28,860
You know you just love when you get RNG like this one. Level two. Let's go.

2284
08:10:42,869 --> 08:10:48,090
Why do I have to hate someone? Is there a reason why I have to hate someone?

2285
08:10:48,729 --> 08:10:56,069
It's the part of the game where I become kind of useless. I'm not going to be able to hurt anything.

2286
08:10:56,709 --> 08:11:06,060
I don't have any moves, but I do have friends that can hurt for me.

2287
08:11:09,340 --> 08:11:25,299
Is it down here? I think the red dead stream when he just showed up. Yeah, that was funny.

2288
08:11:26,099 --> 08:11:32,549
There it is again. Nice. Quickly doing this. Good because arcane sanctuary is a pain in the ass.

2289
08:11:32,549 --> 08:11:53,939
So I'm glad to get this out of the way. I need one more mage. The whole team is here now.

2290
08:11:59,380 --> 08:12:03,880
Oh, Vinny is here. I wish that red dead stream worked better, but it's always good to play

2291
08:12:03,880 --> 08:12:12,889
games with you, Jeremo. What's going on, Vinny? Good to see you. Look at this. We're getting such

2292
08:12:12,889 --> 08:12:23,750
good random roles. Vinny, I'd love to play Diablo 2 with you, but I'm not sure if you're here,

2293
08:12:23,750 --> 08:12:28,150
but I've been shadow banned from Diablo 2 for a reason I can't figure out why.

2294
08:12:29,110 --> 08:12:43,819
I have to buy, I have to have a new account. It's weird. Yeah, I don't know. Who knows?

2295
08:12:51,029 --> 08:13:02,310
He got reported for GlideWrapper. I went off. I went off. I talked a little bit about Blizzard

2296
08:13:02,310 --> 08:13:16,680
earlier, but if I actually got banned for trying to get their game to run, like get out of here.

2297
08:13:16,680 --> 08:13:32,500
No, don't want to go that way. I'm so starved of stamina. So bad. I streamed this last year

2298
08:13:32,500 --> 08:13:36,580
and I still love it. I was not banned. However, I'm glad I'm glad to hear you weren't banned.

2299
08:13:45,369 --> 08:13:50,180
I usually play this game once every couple of years. Once every two or three years,

2300
08:13:50,180 --> 08:13:54,259
I'll just turn this on and do act one and then uninstall it. It happens like every couple of

2301
08:13:54,259 --> 08:13:59,189
years. I don't think there's ever a time where I was like, you know, I'm going to install a

2302
08:13:59,189 --> 08:14:18,900
level 99 cheats. I think so. It's just kind of what you do with this game. If anyone's

2303
08:14:18,900 --> 08:14:24,419
been keeping track, I think that's like the 12th or 15th composite rare bow in a row.

2304
08:14:25,220 --> 08:14:40,490
Can I get anything else? That'd be happy. Act one is the ugliest environment.

2305
08:14:42,310 --> 08:14:48,380
I would say act three is probably uglier than act one. Act three has a couple of places that

2306
08:14:48,380 --> 08:15:05,180
have just and they spread out weirdly. Speedrun time. Let's go. This better not kill me. This

2307
08:15:05,180 --> 08:15:10,180
better not kill me. This better not kill me. This better not kill me. Okay. Don't open that

2308
08:15:10,180 --> 08:15:16,360
door. Don't open that door. Vic, don't open that door. Look how smart you are. I'm so glad that

2309
08:15:16,360 --> 08:15:27,799
you're smarter than the pizza because the pizza just opens every single door. All right. I'll open

2310
08:15:27,799 --> 08:15:34,810
the door now. Now that we're all here. Can I even open this door? You can't even open this door.

2311
08:15:36,569 --> 08:15:43,610
Wait. Yes, you can. What? I couldn't do it before.

2312
08:15:49,159 --> 08:15:52,599
This is an honest, this is a mistake to do. I found it. It's right there. It's right there.

2313
08:15:53,240 --> 08:15:56,119
Okay. I got to go up and then left. Make sure you have stamina for this shit.

2314
08:16:01,220 --> 08:16:17,990
Ah, almost got it. You almost got it. That was close. It was real close. Quick do another one.

2315
08:16:17,990 --> 08:16:33,270
All right. Get in on our way to the arcane sanctuary. I hope I don't die here.

2316
08:16:34,229 --> 08:16:42,500
You know, if I wanted to, I could just completely game this stream

2317
08:16:43,220 --> 08:16:50,630
and I can turn the stream off whenever I want. Oh shit. I died in arcane sanctuary. Well,

2318
08:16:50,630 --> 08:16:57,130
hardcore. See, that's it. See you later. I'm not going to do that though.

2319
08:17:21,610 --> 08:17:30,090
Just going, just going. It's right here. Arcane sanctuary. Here we go. Find the journal.

2320
08:17:31,130 --> 08:17:34,259
I wish I had time to study this bizarre dimension.

2321
08:17:34,259 --> 08:17:40,180
So if you don't know about arcane sanctuary, all this place works is you have four directions.

2322
08:17:40,180 --> 08:17:44,180
Usually you play this with four people or at least four or five people. Sometimes if you have eight,

2323
08:17:44,740 --> 08:17:50,340
that's great because you go in groups of two. It sucks because I'm alone. I got to do it in groups

2324
08:17:50,340 --> 08:17:56,810
of one and you pick a direction and you go all the way. It takes about 15 to 20 plus minutes per

2325
08:17:56,810 --> 08:18:18,889
direction. You might hit a dead end and only one of them is correct. Which way do I go?

2326
08:18:18,889 --> 08:18:29,689
And now we wait. Let us vote. What the fuck? Chat picks everything. What the fuck?

2327
08:18:30,819 --> 08:18:43,060
It's all good. You would have picked this way anyways. I got to go back to town.

2328
08:18:54,659 --> 08:19:03,270
Can't can do that for free, Jeremy. What the fuck are you doing? Not a bad helmet.

2329
08:19:03,909 --> 08:19:08,779
One of the decks are already terrible. Four to mana, get out of here. I need mana potions.

2330
08:19:09,740 --> 08:19:13,689
Yeah, you don't.

2331
08:19:14,250 --> 08:19:30,759
Jeremy is ignoring his viewers. Did you put the cube in your stash? Yeah, what? What? I don't like

2332
08:19:30,759 --> 08:19:48,840
it in here. I don't like the way it looks in here. It's free inventory space. I know, but I don't

2333
08:19:48,840 --> 08:20:01,669
like it in here. I remember back in the day, perfect skulls went for a lot. Let's do some stats.

2334
08:20:07,590 --> 08:20:11,580
You can see what we have so far. Five points going in what? Please decide.

2335
08:20:12,540 --> 08:20:27,349
Yeah, perfect. Have you had 20, 30 perfect skulls? They were pretty good currency. Yeah,

2336
08:20:27,349 --> 08:20:49,380
I'll show you the bones. I remember when FDR was president. All right, vitality. Good choice.

2337
08:20:52,389 --> 08:21:05,479
We also need a skill point here. So have we unlocked anything new? Not yet. No. Same deal.

2338
08:21:06,119 --> 08:21:13,509
We're almost at 10 points in Ray's skeleton. A bunch of random points in blood golem and

2339
08:21:13,909 --> 08:21:34,860
mastery. Just to give you a look at the category. And we are actually, we're going to kill Dariel

2340
08:21:34,860 --> 08:21:52,229
and I'm going to turn off the stream. It's going to be over after that. We're at eight and a half

2341
08:21:52,229 --> 08:22:07,849
hours. It's a long time. I'm not, I'm not aiming for another 13 hour stream today. All right,

2342
08:22:07,849 --> 08:22:29,909
we're in the same category. What do you want? What are you guys doing? What are you guys doing?

2343
08:22:35,430 --> 08:23:00,040
Uh, guys, guys. Okay. Strike three and I pick a strike three and I'm going to pick a skill.

2344
08:23:00,040 --> 08:23:26,150
This is strike three. Here it comes. You already picked summoning spells. You already, you guys

2345
08:23:26,150 --> 08:23:46,099
already picked the category. What is happening right now? We want to change category. Broken?

2346
08:23:47,700 --> 08:24:04,139
There are 320 votes so far. We want different category. We want new category, different

2347
08:24:04,139 --> 08:24:16,229
category, different category. Well, you picked it already. No, new category now. We want,

2348
08:24:16,229 --> 08:24:28,759
we want blood. I'm going to give you guys one more chance. If you really want to change categories,

2349
08:24:28,759 --> 08:24:38,119
this is your only opportunity. Otherwise, I'm picking something. All right, fine. Jesus.

2350
08:24:39,080 --> 08:25:13,029
Poison and bone. We're here. See? We made it. What do you want? Okay. Sure. Sure. Okay. So good.

2351
08:25:13,029 --> 08:25:32,200
Cool. I'm about to pick something. This isn't us, Jerma. This is bots. We're already here. You

2352
08:25:32,200 --> 08:25:54,889
don't, we're already in summoning spells. Someone else is doing this. He doesn't know. What would I

2353
08:25:54,889 --> 08:26:10,119
know? No, this isn't bots. Bots wouldn't do this. Okay. All right. All right. That's it. All right.

2354
08:26:10,119 --> 08:26:18,459
The stream's over. That's it. Pick something. Pick something. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, pick

2355
08:26:18,459 --> 08:26:21,419
something. Go, go, go, go, go, go, pick something. Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick, pick,

2356
08:26:21,419 --> 08:26:50,939
go, go, go, go, go. Delta mage. Thanks for picking. Nice work. It only took you

2357
08:26:51,900 --> 08:27:01,509
six straight minutes to figure that out. I don't need two more points to get another mage to get

2358
08:27:01,509 --> 08:27:09,270
to four. I'm trying to artificially inflate, you know, how long the stream is. I see. I know

2359
08:27:09,270 --> 08:27:31,740
what you guys are doing. Back to the sanctuary. Am I going to play this again? I'll be honest.

2360
08:27:31,740 --> 08:27:52,919
I don't think this is going to last this long. So I mean, I'm still alive. I'm still alive. Although

2361
08:27:52,919 --> 08:28:03,299
I can probably give that 60. All right. Yeah. I'm going to give this to, uh, nice. Good. All right.

2362
08:28:03,299 --> 08:28:08,299
Let's get lucky here and have this be the right one. The first try. That's why you're doing the

2363
08:28:08,299 --> 08:28:25,049
TVs. What's going on on TV? All I can do is sit back here and just cast amplified damage and just

2364
08:28:25,049 --> 08:28:44,569
wait for them to die. I don't, I don't see it. I don't see it. In fact, I actually don't really

2365
08:28:44,569 --> 08:28:56,520
know what an ender dragon looks like. Five skeletons. There's four. What does the ender

2366
08:28:56,520 --> 08:29:01,610
dragon look like? I feel like I know what it looks like, but I don't at the same time.

2367
08:29:02,729 --> 08:29:16,819
Arcane sanctuary is also a place you cannot just run through. I wish it weren't the case,

2368
08:29:16,819 --> 08:29:21,860
but you have to actually play this because the corridors are three squares wide.

2369
08:29:22,819 --> 08:29:37,830
And we find the correct tomb of pal Russia. And then we kill durial and turn the stream off.

2370
08:29:59,209 --> 08:30:07,939
I'm just here to watch you die. Well, that would be a long nine hours. Wouldn't it just die to

2371
08:30:07,939 --> 08:30:19,270
durial. He sucks though. Durial socks. He just, it's a tiny little area. I don't know what the

2372
08:30:19,270 --> 08:30:24,150
hell I'm going to do. You know, I'm going to have to go in and here's the, his plan. The plan is

2373
08:30:25,669 --> 08:30:29,349
bring an absolute shitload amount of mana potions into the dungeon

2374
08:30:30,310 --> 08:30:36,790
and have durial just fight my blood golem. It's going to take like 30 minutes to kill him,

2375
08:30:36,790 --> 08:30:53,209
but that's the only thing I can do. You're really supposed to one hit kill you. No, he's not. I,

2376
08:30:53,209 --> 08:31:01,400
look at, I have 49 cold resist. I'll just stack it. Yeah. I'll just bone wall myself into a corner

2377
08:31:02,200 --> 08:31:08,009
and let the blood go. I just keep respawning the blood golem with like a hundred potions.

2378
08:31:08,009 --> 08:31:18,409
I'm going to fill every slot in my inventory with potions. Stop pretending. This isn't hard.

2379
08:31:18,409 --> 08:31:25,080
What have I done? What did I do wrong? I'm playing a summoning necromancer. What are you talking

2380
08:31:25,080 --> 08:31:33,700
about? What more am I supposed to do right now? What more am I supposed to do right now? I have

2381
08:31:33,700 --> 08:31:58,419
just a bunch of people. I can't do anything. Folks explosion is summoning building. Um, I just,

2382
08:31:59,220 --> 08:32:10,040
I don't have it. This is all I have. This is all I have to work with.

2383
08:32:17,880 --> 08:32:21,799
I mean, it wouldn't be chat picks everything. If I go, you know, let me sneak a corpse explosion

2384
08:32:21,799 --> 08:32:40,340
in here. That sounds good. I got lucky. I actually just got lucky. First try. Get them, get up the

2385
08:32:40,340 --> 08:32:44,569
stairs and get them. All right. If I, this is pinwheel. If I die to the summer, that's a

2386
08:32:44,569 --> 08:33:06,490
literally dying to pinwheel. Kill them. Somebody hit them with anything. All right. We're good.

2387
08:33:09,750 --> 08:33:16,459
It was oops. I just skipped everything. All right. We did it. Canyon of the Magi.

2388
08:33:17,020 --> 08:33:23,139
That didn't take 20 minutes. I was like, I'm really lucky. I didn't have to go through all

2389
08:33:23,139 --> 08:33:27,419
the portal shit. You don't know how annoying that could possibly have been.

2390
08:33:32,040 --> 08:33:35,080
Did you know the mage, the summoner is the mage from Diablo one? Yeah.

2391
08:33:35,959 --> 08:33:41,560
Faith will strengthen the courageous heart. I feel no pity for that would be summoner.

2392
08:33:41,560 --> 08:33:45,959
His terrible ambition for demonic power was pretty skilled. And you know, I already got it with,

2393
08:33:47,540 --> 08:33:52,889
uh, random and slayer. The reason why you have to go through all that is because there are a bunch

2394
08:33:52,889 --> 08:33:58,009
of dungeons that all have symbols in front of them. And this is the correct symbol. It's the only one

2395
08:33:58,009 --> 08:34:06,310
that has burial in it. Can't wait. I really hope I don't die here, but it would be a nine hour

2396
08:34:06,310 --> 08:34:20,520
fucking stream to just die to the act two boss. This is why hardcore sucks. All right. Do I have

2397
08:34:20,520 --> 08:34:46,069
any? Okay. 24 health in a helmet. Old resist. I don't have a shield. What do I have right now

2398
08:34:46,069 --> 08:34:57,900
for cold resistance? 49. That's not bad. Normal. That's okay. Let's go. But I played Diablo one.

2399
08:34:58,939 --> 08:35:05,340
Oh, Diablo one doesn't hold up for me like Diablo two does. It's still a good game,

2400
08:35:06,139 --> 08:35:18,939
but I can replay Diablo two many times. Make sure you bring the staff. Yep. I got it. Uh,

2401
08:35:18,939 --> 08:35:25,610
what do I put in here? I'm seeing what help in there. Okay. I'll get more rupees. I did it. It's

2402
08:35:25,610 --> 08:35:55,750
already done. Okay. Now I need a shitload of mana potions. Why can't you pop in this game

2403
08:35:55,750 --> 08:36:08,169
and don't you lose all your items? Remember people used to do, that was a scam that existed

2404
08:36:08,169 --> 08:36:14,180
back in the day. It was, Oh man, let me show you how to dupe. They said if you put the items that

2405
08:36:14,180 --> 08:36:20,740
you wanted on your character and you filled your body with potions like three times and died. Yeah.

2406
08:36:20,740 --> 08:36:24,580
And eventually if you die like three times with a full belt, full potions and everything and no

2407
08:36:24,580 --> 08:36:30,810
slots for anything, your character popped and all your items landed on the ground.

2408
08:36:30,810 --> 08:36:37,220
It was a lot of Diablo scams. Another scam in particular was the switcheroo. So there's only,

2409
08:36:37,220 --> 08:36:42,180
I think, three or four different pieces of art for Diablo twos, rings and amulets and weapons

2410
08:36:42,180 --> 08:36:48,779
and swords and stuff. So what would happen is somebody would, you had to check a box and that

2411
08:36:48,779 --> 08:36:54,099
other person had to check a box to be able to have a transaction go through. You both had a trade

2412
08:36:54,099 --> 08:36:58,580
window and somebody, let's say this was the stone of Jordan, one of the most sought after rings in

2413
08:36:58,580 --> 08:37:05,110
the whole game. And it would have this art because they all have the same art. They'd put it in.

2414
08:37:05,110 --> 08:37:10,869
Yeah, I want two worm skulls. You're like, okay. Yeah, sure. Here's my worm skull. Here it is.

2415
08:37:10,869 --> 08:37:16,709
And then I would check the box and they would go, Oh, hold on a second. I need some inventory

2416
08:37:16,709 --> 08:37:20,470
space. And they would get back and they do this bullshit. They'd walk over and pretend to go to

2417
08:37:20,470 --> 08:37:26,970
the fucking stash. And then they come back and they say, Okay, hey, and they'd go put it in the

2418
08:37:26,970 --> 08:37:31,700
window, check the box. And then you would put your thing in the window, check the box. And it was like,

2419
08:37:32,419 --> 08:37:46,220
Oh, no. Oh, and it was one of these. And this shit worked all the time. Why would you trade?

2420
08:37:46,860 --> 08:37:55,029
I don't know, because you don't, you don't. It's a scam. Scam. That's like saying, Oh, hey, dude,

2421
08:37:55,029 --> 08:38:00,790
when, when Microsoft calls you and tells you that the IRS is looking for $50 in iTunes gift cards,

2422
08:38:00,790 --> 08:38:15,909
what just, why do you do that? The scams work, man. This is how he was banned. No, this is shit

2423
08:38:15,909 --> 08:38:20,229
that happened like 20 years ago. I didn't do this shit. I was, I, it happened to me once.

2424
08:38:21,110 --> 08:38:32,259
I was like 14. I got scammed out of a pre patch worm skull. I told you guys that that thing was

2425
08:38:32,259 --> 08:38:36,979
worth a shit load. And I remember just DMing this person over and over again, telling them

2426
08:38:36,979 --> 08:38:47,049
that my brother gave it to me. That was a gift from my brother. I got scammed. Yeah, it was horrible.

2427
08:38:49,099 --> 08:38:52,380
And I say like me and my brother don't talk anymore. And that was like one of the things

2428
08:38:52,380 --> 08:38:57,799
that me and my brother did. And I, we love Diablo. We don't talk anymore. And sometimes he logs on

2429
08:38:57,799 --> 08:39:09,659
and like we play and that's his worm skull. And the guy was like, fuck off. And what I was saying was

2430
08:39:09,659 --> 08:39:23,369
total horse shit. But still, what a dick. I'm not even sure there was a report button in the game,

2431
08:39:23,369 --> 08:39:28,099
guys. See nowadays, when you play like League of Legends and somebody tells you to like, to go,

2432
08:39:28,099 --> 08:39:35,880
like, fuck you, buddy. You like report. Somebody sees it. And then that person gets into, I don't

2433
08:39:35,880 --> 08:39:44,180
think that even was possible. You could do the ring scam a hundred times. And it was just like,

2434
08:39:44,180 --> 08:39:56,380
that's the ring scam guy. There he is. He joined another server. I think you actually had to email

2435
08:39:56,380 --> 08:40:01,779
support. But I think there was a thing that said that you're not going to get your items back.

2436
08:40:02,340 --> 08:40:16,340
Uh, be careful. It worked though. All right. What was I doing? This. Prepare. Let's go kill

2437
08:40:16,340 --> 08:40:25,299
Duriel and then we'll turn off this ring. I'm ready. What's the symbol look like again? Circle

2438
08:40:25,299 --> 08:40:39,259
with the smiley underneath. Okay. All right. I hit the way point. I had a way point. What

2439
08:40:39,259 --> 08:40:45,930
am I doing? What the hell am I over here? He doesn't need a ring. He needs another ring.

2440
08:40:49,659 --> 08:40:56,299
All right. Is it weird that I don't give a shit because that ring is like plus one to maximum

2441
08:40:56,299 --> 08:41:09,639
damage or something. I'll find a better one. Probably right now. We aren't fighting anything.

2442
08:41:09,639 --> 08:41:35,290
Let's go. I know the symbol. Not the one. Not the one. There's a circle above it. Not the one.

2443
08:41:36,169 --> 08:41:48,380
Why do you keep ignoring gold? Because once you get to act four, act five, the gold is meaningless

2444
08:41:48,380 --> 08:42:04,299
in this game. Once you get to like nightmare act one, gold has no value. Don't die to this.

2445
08:42:05,020 --> 08:42:07,819
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

2446
08:42:07,819 --> 08:42:23,139
important. I got to. Okay. We need some skeletons and shit. I almost just walked in here with

2447
08:42:23,139 --> 08:42:47,610
nothing. Horrible. All right. Leveled up. Good for you. Don't run on this. Oh, there's a well.

2448
08:42:47,610 --> 08:42:59,479
Cranked on the well. Uh, wrong. Is there one more down here? I don't think so. Yes, there is.

2449
08:43:00,439 --> 08:43:31,430
Wrong. Uh, wrong. Right. There it is. Boss time. Because this is a pretty big apex of the stream

2450
08:43:31,430 --> 08:43:38,979
here. I want to know how many people have any confidence in me beating this. Let's see. Am I

2451
08:43:38,979 --> 08:44:05,060
going to beat Duriel? I'm actually curious. Yes. Yes. Yeah. All right. Actually we're getting a

2452
08:44:05,060 --> 08:44:22,900
lot of yeses. Okay. No more levels up. Oh boy. Easy. 75%. All right. Thanks for the confidence

2453
08:44:22,900 --> 08:44:33,020
boost. It's going to be very boring and you'll beat him and pretend it's hype. Oh, I turned off

2454
08:44:33,020 --> 08:44:49,540
hype trains by the way. You probably noticing why you haven't seen them. I turned mine off too.

2455
08:44:52,250 --> 08:45:01,860
Yeah, it's just, uh, this is going to be incredibly disappointing if he was. Um, yes,

2456
08:45:01,860 --> 08:45:06,020
it will be because that would be, it would be nine hours of a total waste of fucking time

2457
08:45:06,020 --> 08:45:28,409
because I can't log on to this character again. Let me in. What are you going to put in that

2458
08:45:28,409 --> 08:45:46,490
wallet now? What do you mean? Cause I turned off hype trains. I mean, it's, it's a, this is a tricky

2459
08:45:46,490 --> 08:45:54,860
zone. Oh, it's an, it's an interesting idea. It's just, even when you put it hard to do,

2460
08:45:54,860 --> 08:46:13,319
it still happens. And it's sort of just a game of focus on the game. All right. All right. All

2461
08:46:13,319 --> 08:46:19,610
right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to have to do that. We're going to have to focus on the game.

2462
08:46:19,610 --> 08:46:25,049
Otherwise I'm going to die before getting to even to the holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.

2463
08:46:26,889 --> 08:46:54,759
Ring mail. That's a couple of greens. This is Arctic Arctic. Oh, it's angelic. Oh,

2464
08:46:54,759 --> 08:47:05,740
these little normal difficulty, shitty sets. I'll give it to you. I don't know what you have on.

2465
08:47:25,819 --> 08:47:33,860
Oh, scary room, scary room. No, no, Vic. He's dead. What the fuck is even in here doing that?

2466
08:47:34,340 --> 08:47:47,939
What the hell is in here? Nothing. Nothing. A whole lot of nothing. I'll get them back

2467
08:47:47,939 --> 08:48:19,400
before I did Daryl. Don't worry. I'm going to keep them alive. You're going to die to a chest trap.

2468
08:48:20,040 --> 08:48:28,650
You probably, that's why I'm not kicking over any chests. Cause that's bad. I don't want to die to

2469
08:48:28,650 --> 08:48:48,060
a chest trap. Kind of feel naked with a Vic. That aura was actually pretty key. All right.

2470
08:48:48,060 --> 08:49:09,590
Everybody get in here. Oh, oh my God. Oh my God. It's itching my eye. Hardcore is a horror,

2471
08:49:09,590 --> 08:49:17,099
especially in Act 2. Cause Act 2's light radius sucks. So you'll just open up one of these doors

2472
08:49:17,099 --> 08:49:22,279
and there's 40 people standing behind it, just waiting to kill you. And half of them shoot

2473
08:49:22,279 --> 08:49:31,720
lightning out of the rest. That's fun. Act 3 is not going to be any better. No, it won't.

2474
08:49:32,360 --> 08:49:48,549
They're doing all right. I think it's safe to get in here now and go for a kill myself.

2475
08:49:49,349 --> 08:50:05,619
Nothing. Anything dropped. Nothing good. Can't carry anymore. Anyway, bone wand. Let's take a look.

2476
08:50:10,819 --> 08:50:20,099
Uh, one to teeth. He's

2477
08:50:34,330 --> 08:50:50,900
laws. I have to go back to stay back when they die. Replace them. Five,

2478
08:50:51,700 --> 08:51:04,939
a number looking for a room with an, there's an orifice. Probably not this way, but let's go.

2479
08:51:30,259 --> 08:52:01,159
This is so bad. Jesus. I can't walk in here. How did you get back? Where are they coming from?

2480
08:52:01,159 --> 08:52:15,130
Where are they coming from? Back to town. Back to town. Tell this shit.

2481
08:52:16,330 --> 08:52:51,099
Oh, a man of potions. The ring. It's not whatever. All right. Let's go get our buddy back.

2482
08:52:51,099 --> 08:53:13,049
Good evening. $3,000 to bring you back. Come on. Stay alive. All right. Vic being here now.

2483
08:53:13,049 --> 08:53:16,970
We're going to be doing just fine. Everybody get in here and go and go.

2484
08:53:21,720 --> 08:53:34,139
Okay. How's everybody doing? Oh, party. I got to keep an eye on Vic's health because he's probably

2485
08:53:34,139 --> 08:53:42,759
the most important person here. You see this Vic shows up and it's just instant kills for people.

2486
08:53:43,319 --> 08:54:06,220
Another wink. What? That one hurt. Another stupid room where we just stuff in Vic. Get in there.

2487
08:54:07,560 --> 08:54:26,250
The only person here worth anything. All right. I'm going to get in there.

2488
08:54:26,250 --> 08:54:41,509
Now I'm going to go snipe the guy back here. Where am I going? Probably to the right.

2489
08:54:41,509 --> 08:54:56,810
All right. Let's go. Come on. We're almost there. Can't get lazy on hardcore either.

2490
08:54:57,610 --> 08:55:25,349
As long as Vic is in there. Hey, wink. Yeah, I can see the channel. I'm going in. Three, two, one.

2491
08:55:30,619 --> 08:55:39,479
Good. Yes, we are. Hang on. Right. Stay with me. Don't attack the one person over there.

2492
08:55:39,479 --> 08:56:07,479
I'll be idiots. I got to get back. I'm just replenishing. Good.

2493
08:56:08,520 --> 08:56:12,490
This is summoning Necro right here. This isn't what it's all about.

2494
08:56:13,290 --> 08:56:23,270
You just don't do anything. Well, if you're at a party with a summoning Necro, it's great

2495
08:56:24,229 --> 08:56:30,580
because all the minions just eat every hit and you just create just a smash on people.

2496
08:56:37,479 --> 08:56:52,200
My almost done. Poison Nova Necro is fun too. Yeah. Because you just run in a room,

2497
08:56:52,200 --> 08:56:58,779
right click and then run away and just let everything die. You have to do every synergy

2498
08:56:58,779 --> 08:57:16,229
though or you're useless in hell. I can sell this. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

2499
08:57:19,900 --> 08:57:36,490
Vic, careful. Nice. How many players do I have to sit on? Still four.

2500
08:57:37,450 --> 08:57:57,450
I just leveled up. Maybe the Spear is better. Two to 24. No. Old Resist though. Here. Is this

2501
08:57:57,450 --> 08:58:19,060
better than 32 to 92? That's better. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm going to just check over here.

2502
08:58:19,619 --> 08:58:29,700
Just I want to look. It might be right here. Oh, God damn it. This place is huge. This place is

2503
08:58:29,700 --> 08:59:07,450
enormous. Too many people. Sweat check. Not really. Take a hit. One hit would be pretty deadly here.

2504
08:59:17,669 --> 08:59:38,180
This game is a God damn mess. Oh, Eisenhearts. Another shitty one. Eisenhearts case 107 with

2505
08:59:38,180 --> 08:59:46,860
magic damage reduced by two. It's just, unless you get it, this is bad. What do you have on?

2506
08:59:46,860 --> 08:59:55,500
I mean, this is just better. Where's Tal Roshas? You don't get that till like nightmare

2507
09:00:05,750 --> 09:00:17,290
or hell. I think that only drops in hell. Balloons going down. I might actually get to level up one

2508
09:00:17,290 --> 09:00:25,209
more time before Durial. That'd be nice. LOD improves the game significantly. Yes, it does.

2509
09:00:27,560 --> 09:00:31,619
At this point, I think that I'm not sure I'd want to play just regular Diablo 2

2510
09:00:32,180 --> 09:00:46,919
without LOD. Too much better. Too many improvements. So many more items. So many

2511
09:00:46,919 --> 09:00:53,220
more runes. As much as the charm system is kind of dumb, it's still there and it's kind of

2512
09:00:53,220 --> 09:01:07,740
interesting to find stuff that works with your character. Can this be a yearly thing?

2513
09:01:10,810 --> 09:01:26,259
Hold on. I love this game. So I'm going to take very much to convince me to play it.

2514
09:01:27,220 --> 09:01:34,169
I just want to see if it was possible for me to get into the first.

2515
09:01:34,889 --> 09:01:40,650
As you guys know, I'm not going to play games like hardcore. I play them just kind of to do them.

2516
09:01:41,380 --> 09:01:50,919
Don't go down that high by yourself. What are you thinking? I'm about to make a full circle.

2517
09:01:51,880 --> 09:02:49,560
Here comes the full circle. Sneak around. Don't go too far. Where am I? 23. That's exactly where

2518
09:02:49,560 --> 09:02:54,119
I wanted to be for Durial. Right about 24, 25 is when you should be kind of going through.

2519
09:02:55,400 --> 09:02:59,400
I would say Act 3, you really want to... What would you guys say? It doesn't get played in

2520
09:02:59,400 --> 09:03:11,770
25, 30 for Act 3? Something like that. I've got to be close. This is getting ridiculous. Come on.

2521
09:03:11,770 --> 09:03:22,860
How big is this? This build puts us at about level 15. Well, I mean, there are points in

2522
09:03:22,860 --> 09:03:28,330
Bonewall. And there's a point in Teeth, a point in Bonewall. I don't even check yet.

2523
09:03:30,889 --> 09:03:38,439
What else is there? Points in Blood Golem? Golem Mastery? There's at least five points here that

2524
09:03:38,439 --> 09:03:41,319
are not being utilized well. You guys got to think about what the hell you want to do.

2525
09:03:42,040 --> 09:04:13,020
Those are well spent points. We can agree to disagree on them. What about a Snow Golem?

2526
09:04:13,020 --> 09:04:26,889
I don't think they exist, but that would be cool. An Ice Golem? Someone who lives and breathes this

2527
09:04:26,889 --> 09:04:34,380
game. This is painful. This is what happens when you give 5,000 people or 6,000 people earlier

2528
09:04:34,939 --> 09:04:54,650
power to choose a character in a World of Warcraft. Wrong franchise. We're down 4K now.

2529
09:04:54,650 --> 09:04:59,450
Yes, we are. It's also midnight Pacific. It's also very, very late. I'm actually surprised

2530
09:04:59,450 --> 09:05:08,819
this many people are still here. So thanks for sticking around. Hope you like it. I'm having fun.

2531
09:05:12,580 --> 09:05:18,869
All right. There's only one place. Again, look what happened. Every single place uncovered except

2532
09:05:18,869 --> 09:05:35,220
the one spot where it is again. And again, please don't beat the boss. I'm done. I'm done after this.

2533
09:05:35,779 --> 09:05:44,659
There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. Don't get stuck. EU wait. No, I'm done.

2534
09:05:49,189 --> 09:05:53,450
Whatever happens here, this is the end of the stream. I'm either going to die to Durial or

2535
09:05:53,450 --> 09:06:01,020
we're going to have beaten Act 2 and we can keep going another time probably. I really hope I don't

2536
09:06:01,020 --> 09:06:22,360
die though, because this would be, that would be sad. I'm not even here. What is tomorrow's

2537
09:06:22,360 --> 09:06:28,680
stream going to be? Well, I got to talk to Joel because I know he said that he wanted to keep

2538
09:06:28,680 --> 09:06:34,120
talking, but I couldn't do it today. So we're either going to do that tomorrow or the next day.

2539
09:06:34,919 --> 09:06:53,110
Let me stop for a second and catch my breath. Where's the one place I didn't go?

2540
09:06:54,069 --> 09:06:59,690
Where the hell is it? Off left?

2541
09:07:02,739 --> 09:07:11,699
Do I know about the dupe glitch? It's not a scam. Well, I want to do this legit. If I'm going to

2542
09:07:11,699 --> 09:07:17,379
beat Diablo hardcore, I want to be for real. I don't want to, I don't want to dupe like

2543
09:07:17,379 --> 09:07:45,209
50 million gold or something up there. It's here. It's here. I found it. It's here.

2544
09:07:46,169 --> 09:07:55,180
Crime I dupe glitch. It's not a scam. I promise. Just stand on the outside of the Rogan camp and

2545
09:07:55,580 --> 09:08:01,940
drop your best item on the ground. Oh, sorry. I'm a sorceress with telekinesis and I'm just

2546
09:08:01,940 --> 09:08:07,139
going to pick it up. See, if you're outside the camp, this is for security. So I don't get it.

2547
09:08:07,940 --> 09:08:16,010
I know all the tricks. Yeah, drop. You guys remember that too? Yeah, I do. I remember just

2548
09:08:16,010 --> 09:08:20,809
being in the Rogan camp with eight people that are strangers. I don't know why the fuck we did

2549
09:08:20,809 --> 09:08:26,330
this. We were psychos. I don't know what was wrong with us, but everybody would stand around

2550
09:08:26,330 --> 09:08:29,290
and you would just run to this because no one's paying attention. You don't tell anybody this.

2551
09:08:30,169 --> 09:08:35,029
And you just drop one of the best items of the whole game. Pick it back up quick. You just,

2552
09:08:35,029 --> 09:08:38,790
oh, hey, there's like 10 people there. I don't know. I'm strangers to fucking all of you.

2553
09:08:38,790 --> 09:08:42,629
I'm going to drop the best weapon in the entire game over here, like a hundred feet away and wait

2554
09:08:42,629 --> 09:08:48,500
till somebody runs over and pick it up. And sometimes somebody would get it. And at that

2555
09:08:48,500 --> 09:09:02,339
point you just exit in a quick game. You're not getting it back. But it always was so fucked up

2556
09:09:02,980 --> 09:09:08,739
when you did that right next to somebody and they just missed it. Now this game was taken

2557
09:09:08,739 --> 09:09:14,660
dead seriously back in the day. It's 15, 20 plus years ago, guys. If somebody were to get a

2558
09:09:14,660 --> 09:09:22,019
grandfather two handed great sword without even trying, and it was a great role that took hundreds

2559
09:09:22,019 --> 09:09:32,599
of fucking hundreds and hundreds of hours to find that just rolling dice. Now imagine if it was right

2560
09:09:32,599 --> 09:09:39,559
in front of you and you had an opportunity, it was this far away and you didn't get it. That shit

2561
09:09:39,559 --> 09:09:53,239
happened all the time. People look crazy. I'm not even over here. This is the biggest dungeon

2562
09:09:53,239 --> 09:09:58,860
I've ever seen in my whole life. Why is this dungeon so huge? Why is this so big? I don't

2563
09:09:58,860 --> 09:10:18,739
remember being this big. There it is. He missed. Is it always this big? Maybe. Okay. I needed to

2564
09:10:18,739 --> 09:10:32,569
make a town run. Parents of hate level two on hell says hi. Yeah. That area is such a blur to me

2565
09:10:32,569 --> 09:10:39,699
though because I have like the 300 magic fine sorceress and you just want one one one one one

2566
09:10:39,699 --> 09:10:44,819
level three one one one one static static static static Nova Nova Nova. Give me my items. Do it

2567
09:10:44,819 --> 09:11:00,790
again. You do it like a hundred times in a day. All right. I need to get this actually situated.

2568
09:11:00,790 --> 09:11:12,019
We need, uh, what is it for rejuvenation post institutions? It is three of each, right?

2569
09:11:12,739 --> 09:11:29,379
Oh, is this even necessary? Not. I don't, I don't, I don't need like a full stack inventory of

2570
09:11:29,379 --> 09:11:44,779
potions. Just mana. Put this in the stash. I'll figure it out later. Okay. Here we go. Kim subbed?

2571
09:11:45,500 --> 09:11:51,739
Did she really? Kim, thanks for the sub. But did somebody, oh, somebody gifted her a sub. Okay.

2572
09:11:52,300 --> 09:11:59,989
Hey, Spleen. Thanks for gifting him a sub. All right. So remember the plan here

2573
09:12:00,949 --> 09:12:08,389
is to spam potions with the inventory open and just make sure I keep my Golem and Vic alive.

2574
09:12:09,029 --> 09:12:31,900
That's the plan. How many town porters do I have? Plenty. Okay. I'm ready. Level up. Yeah. Yeah.

2575
09:12:31,900 --> 09:12:36,459
Level level level level level level. Yes. Yes. Yes. Stop. Stop. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I don't know.

2576
09:12:36,459 --> 09:12:45,220
All right. Hold on. Do I need this many potions? No, but I've died to Durial dozens of times on

2577
09:12:45,220 --> 09:13:12,019
normal running around in a circle. So yeah, I kind of, maybe I do. Big stat. Five points.

2578
09:13:12,019 --> 09:13:21,139
All good things must come to an end. If you can win here against Durial, you can beat Vale

2579
09:13:22,019 --> 09:13:39,500
without dying once to the ancients. That's going to be tricky. Vitality. And pick a skill.

2580
09:13:40,379 --> 09:13:55,139
The ancients are actually a joke for Skelemancer. Are they really? I'm not sure I've ever played

2581
09:13:55,139 --> 09:14:05,209
a summoner all the way that far. I usually just get bored and give up because you just

2582
09:14:05,209 --> 09:14:10,169
watch 20 people fight on the screen. I'm always like, yeah, I'm done. And then I make a paladin

2583
09:14:10,169 --> 09:14:25,720
or something. What is corpse explosion is under poison and bone. Yeah. I have amplified damage

2584
09:14:25,720 --> 09:14:38,250
already. The burning souls in act four that one shot you. Yeah. Hopefully we'll have some decent

2585
09:14:38,250 --> 09:14:48,949
items by then if that happens. Okay. You guys want to go poison and bone? Is it because somebody

2586
09:14:48,949 --> 09:14:53,269
came in and said that they had 5,000 hours in the game and now you're embarrassed that you didn't

2587
09:14:53,269 --> 09:15:10,779
pick the best spell in the game? Is that what's going on? Okay. No, no, no. You pick something

2588
09:15:10,779 --> 09:15:15,400
from here. You pick something from here. Yeah. I'm not going back to summoning. You've already

2589
09:15:15,400 --> 09:15:21,290
made your choice. You pick something from here. I'm not going back. Corpse explosion. Which one is

2590
09:15:21,290 --> 09:15:35,129
corpse explosion? Why? This is not going to do anything for Dariel. No, no, we're not going.

2591
09:15:35,129 --> 09:15:39,690
We're not doing the back and forth like back and forth. Are we going to go summoning? No,

2592
09:15:39,690 --> 09:15:49,559
just kidding. All right. Corpse explosion. It is. I know there's at least 8% of you. They're

2593
09:15:49,559 --> 09:16:04,309
clicking on teeth, but corpse explosion was vitality and corpse explosion. And you guys,

2594
09:16:04,309 --> 09:16:07,910
didn't you guys wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We've leveled up. We've leveled up. And you guys

2595
09:16:07,910 --> 09:16:10,870
didn't even know you could. We've leveled up. We've leveled up. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

2596
09:16:10,870 --> 09:16:14,550
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

2597
09:16:14,550 --> 09:16:20,250
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We, we're going to revote because I didn't show you.

2598
09:16:21,830 --> 09:16:32,389
Iron golem is available. And so is summon resist. This gives resist all elements to all of your

2599
09:16:32,389 --> 09:16:42,709
summoned creatures. Or iron golem transform a weapon or item into a golem. And it has thorns.

2600
09:16:42,709 --> 09:16:56,739
Or you could do bone wall. You've already put one here. Can I interest you in dim vision?

2601
09:16:57,300 --> 09:17:27,449
Do that again. Where do you want to go? Okay. That was very quick.

2602
09:17:28,410 --> 09:17:39,480
Iron golem is a fancy way to save a robot. All right. We're staying in.

2603
09:17:40,519 --> 09:17:51,620
Durial doesn't do elemental damage. Durial does a lot of cold damage. What are we doing?

2604
09:17:51,620 --> 09:18:06,550
Ooh, he's going to be tight. New golem or resist? He swings for physical. He has a frost aura.

2605
09:18:08,099 --> 09:18:15,430
Everything's going to get one shot anyways, including me. 40% of Durial's damage is cold.

2606
09:18:16,309 --> 09:18:31,129
That's what I thought too. Okay. Are you ready? I'm calling it. We're doing summon resist.

2607
09:18:42,419 --> 09:18:51,349
It was vitality, right? Summon resist, 28% to all elements. And then it was vitality.

2608
09:18:51,349 --> 09:19:03,480
Well, this is the shot. Take it. What was it? It was, it was, no, it was vitality. Was it? No,

2609
09:19:03,559 --> 09:19:26,470
it was. It was. I remember. All right. Here we go. Blood golem on cue. Page open. No,

2610
09:19:26,470 --> 09:19:45,980
that's too distracting. Oh, get in. Get him. Holy shit. He's dead. Okay. Golem, get him.

2611
09:19:47,019 --> 09:20:29,080
Please drop the potion on the ground. Oh, that was something. I don't have a chance.

2612
09:20:30,839 --> 09:20:51,940
Well, hold on. Let me, let's. You think I can fight him one-on-one? I have to go one-on-one.

2613
09:20:51,940 --> 09:21:21,419
Is he going to one-hit kill me? He's not going to one-hit kill me, right?

2614
09:21:25,769 --> 09:22:05,449
All right. I don't. Is this doing anything? This is going to take forever. If I drop below

2615
09:22:05,449 --> 09:22:24,019
50% health, I'm running. I'm just spamming potions. Get him. Double team him.

2616
09:22:49,449 --> 09:23:01,830
Thaw, thaw, thaw. I'm in the corner. I'm in the corner. TP out of here. TP. This isn't

2617
09:23:01,830 --> 09:23:06,730
doing anything. I need skill. All right. All right. Here's the plan. I'm going to load the

2618
09:23:06,730 --> 09:23:14,519
fuck up on everything. I'm going to go in. I'm just going to spam him for a little bit. That's the

2619
09:23:14,519 --> 09:23:26,199
plan. If we actually, that's not a bad place to be because we're all going to be stuffed in the

2620
09:23:26,199 --> 09:23:41,750
same area. And maybe I'll take aggro. I need aggro for this to work. Hopefully he attacks me first.

2621
09:23:41,750 --> 09:23:44,790
I'd love any enemies on the ground. Didn't that kill? All right. Let's go back to tall of the

2622
09:23:44,790 --> 09:23:58,739
tomb. I just put on, should I just go get like a kite shield? Yeah. Let's go get the mercenary too.

2623
09:23:58,739 --> 09:24:21,739
Oh, also, by the way, I think he regenerates HP. Yes, he does. I need to just. Oh, these don't do

2624
09:24:21,739 --> 09:24:35,559
anything. This is a waste of time as a total waste of time. I need healing potions. Bonewall

2625
09:24:36,120 --> 09:24:54,779
is not going to do anything. I lose two points in Ray Skeleton though. If I just put on a shield.

2626
09:25:03,959 --> 09:25:15,269
I have 85 cold resist. From what? That's what thawing potion does. How long does that last?

2627
09:25:15,269 --> 09:25:18,389
I didn't even know if that's what that did. I thought it just instantly took cold off.

2628
09:25:23,339 --> 09:25:25,580
Oh, right. Okay. Well, they are worth it then.

2629
09:25:28,059 --> 09:25:50,360
Okay. Let's go to the waypoint and get a full army. He played Diablo 2 for 20 years and you

2630
09:25:50,360 --> 09:25:54,919
don't know what the items do. I've never purchased a thawing potion in my whole life ever playing this

2631
09:25:54,919 --> 09:26:01,860
game. There was never a reason for me to. I just didn't ever. All right. Let's get the team back

2632
09:26:01,860 --> 09:26:39,720
together. Aren't you guys glad you put a point in teeth? All right. We got the team back. Let's get

2633
09:26:39,720 --> 09:26:56,389
up. Five skeletons, three mages. Let's go get our mercenary back. And then there were 10 and I make

2634
09:26:56,389 --> 09:27:09,209
11. If I can get in there and tank this, hopefully we can do it. All right. You good? You good. You

2635
09:27:09,209 --> 09:27:25,620
got some pretty decent things. I have 12. All right. You ready? Three, two, one. Action. I'm

2636
09:27:25,620 --> 09:28:05,180
tanking them. I'm tanking them. Somebody pull aggro. Somebody pull aggro on me. Somebody pull

2637
09:28:05,180 --> 09:28:22,550
aggro. Am I going to die? All right. He's dead. We got him. We got him. We got him. Kill him.

2638
09:28:29,269 --> 09:28:41,940
Yeah. That wasn't that bad. That was fine. I'm scared for no reason. That was scared for no

2639
09:28:41,940 --> 09:28:46,419
reason. That wasn't even that bad. That was not even hard. That was not even that bad.

2640
09:28:52,819 --> 09:29:17,580
And seal. Hopefully this is good. Well, uh, let's one to golem mastery.

2641
09:29:18,300 --> 09:29:30,699
Read a bone sphere. It causes a monster to flee. Bone sphere is pretty good, but it's,

2642
09:29:30,699 --> 09:29:35,500
I, I, this character's, this character's all over the place. I can't even use

2643
09:29:35,500 --> 09:29:53,430
bone sphere. Step on the maggots. Does the one have a faster cast rate?

2644
09:29:56,199 --> 09:30:03,860
Also light radius. I have too much strength to have this be worth it.

2645
09:30:09,800 --> 09:30:19,830
Uh, there comes a loud cut scene, but this is going to be horrible if I keep doing this on

2646
09:30:19,830 --> 09:30:31,699
nightmare. Oh hell. I did expect you earlier. I am the archangel Tyrael. I came here to prevent

2647
09:30:31,699 --> 09:30:38,809
Diablo from freeing his brother Bale, but I have failed. Now terror and destruction roam free

2648
09:30:38,809 --> 09:30:42,809
throughout your world. Diablo's got a pretty good story. Diablo's got a good story.

2649
09:30:42,809 --> 09:31:04,470
Eastern capital of invincible, but their aims are, it is certain that they must be stopped at all

2650
09:31:04,470 --> 09:31:11,019
costs. This is stupid. And the energies that tie me to this world are diminishing. Okay.

2651
09:31:12,220 --> 09:31:17,699
Sorry. You feel that way to prevent the three brothers from reuniting the sea and search for

2652
09:31:17,699 --> 09:31:23,220
Diablo and Bale in chorus. Time is running out. Time is running out for all of us.

2653
09:31:23,860 --> 09:31:40,660
All right, let's go back 13 to 24 fire damage and a stolen loss of attack rating. Better than this,

2654
09:31:40,660 --> 09:32:00,089
right? Hmm. Slow attack speed. Can't can do this for free. The archangel Tyrael was the one who

2655
09:32:00,089 --> 09:32:06,790
gave the soul stones. Yep. This is terrible news. Bale is in possession of one of them.

2656
09:32:06,790 --> 09:32:10,550
Let us choose your weapons and that would be an absolute disaster.

2657
09:32:11,349 --> 09:32:21,099
I just, that wouldn't go over very well. I was going to act three and then we can do

2658
09:32:24,949 --> 09:32:43,989
uh, end of the string. Let's go. Please show stats and stuff. I will. I will show you exactly what

2659
09:32:43,989 --> 09:32:51,290
people have decided to do. Greetings. I'm the chief captain of this ship here. Jaren tells me

2660
09:32:51,290 --> 09:32:57,220
I play act three real, real quick. Um, no, I'm going to kill and Ariel one more time.

2661
09:32:57,220 --> 09:33:02,839
Just YouTube this cut scene. It's fucking, it's pretty good. Greetings.

2662
09:33:03,800 --> 09:33:09,959
Welcome to Karaz traveler. If you come willingly to this ancient city anymore,

2663
09:33:09,959 --> 09:33:15,080
I hope you brought your wits with you for sanity is in short supply here.

2664
09:33:15,080 --> 09:33:25,099
The Fisto is running rampant on here. This is lore. Yeah, but it's, it's 20 year old lore.

2665
09:33:25,099 --> 09:33:40,779
It's 20 year old lore. So I just want to speed this up because I, it is getting late.

2666
09:33:42,300 --> 09:33:45,019
Okay. We'll go over a full, what happened in Diablo two.

2667
09:33:55,419 --> 09:34:15,099
The potion guy has a lot of money. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

2668
09:34:15,099 --> 09:34:24,569
All right. Let's go kill on Dario. I'm going to try to do as fast I can. Why would you want to,

2669
09:34:24,569 --> 09:34:31,610
why would you want to watch act three? Good question. All right, let's go.

2670
09:34:36,440 --> 09:35:10,550
Why does it look so weird? All right, let's go quick quickly. Wait, if you play the game on

2671
09:35:10,550 --> 09:35:23,080
single player, does it, can you act, can, is this, do I need to see this for the rest of the,

2672
09:35:25,959 --> 09:35:46,010
really? I went the wrong way. Uh, usually if you reset a game, doesn't it? Uh, I thought that it

2673
09:35:46,010 --> 09:36:07,720
reset the dungeon too. You have to exit the entire game. Oh, so this is, I'm not, Dario's

2674
09:36:07,720 --> 09:36:16,300
not going to be down here. That's only on D-Net if you close the game. So is Dario not going to be

2675
09:36:16,300 --> 09:36:31,400
down here? He is going to be. Oh, well that makes this way easier. Holy shit. All right. Wow. I

2676
09:36:31,400 --> 09:36:35,529
thought that was going to take a lot longer. So you can just farm the fuck out of bosses on single

2677
09:36:35,529 --> 09:36:57,339
player. All right. Get in there. There's also no lag either. So even though his shadow band from

2678
09:36:57,339 --> 09:37:03,099
battle net for some reason, uh, actually not that concerned about it because when you play it on old

2679
09:37:03,099 --> 09:37:08,940
D-Net, sometimes the game would just hang for five straight seconds and that happened all the damn

2680
09:37:08,940 --> 09:37:15,669
time. It was this weird, like half second lag on everything you did. So actually I'm kind of glad

2681
09:37:15,669 --> 09:37:47,720
I am playing it on here. Change to eight players. Not a bad idea. All right, we're good. You guys

2682
09:37:47,720 --> 09:37:55,750
would like to see the original loot box, but no further than what I'm doing right now. This is

2683
09:37:55,830 --> 09:38:36,339
free. Oh shit. She just killed my friend and we're gonna get, ah, too bad. Too bad. 21.

2684
09:38:37,220 --> 09:38:58,260
It's a junk. Do we get one more time? Oh, okay. One more time. Do one more time. One more time.

2685
09:38:58,260 --> 09:39:03,529
That's it. One more time. That's, that's actually it. One more time. That's it. That'd be 30 times

2686
09:39:03,529 --> 09:39:18,949
done. And that's it. And I'm not doing act three. No, it's 10 fucking hours. No, I'm not.

2687
09:39:19,589 --> 09:39:42,379
We're going to call it. All right, let's go. I want to open another loot box. I just want to get one

2688
09:39:42,379 --> 09:40:09,900
more unique. You know what I mean? I swear to God, this is the last time. This is not happening.

2689
09:40:12,139 --> 09:40:18,230
Actually true. Not happening. Not going to happen. Just, I figured it was going to take me like at

2690
09:40:18,230 --> 09:40:24,650
least 20 minutes to get over here. I didn't realize I could keep doing this until we reset

2691
09:40:24,650 --> 09:40:31,589
difficulty. That's awesome. You said I've been Lord of the Rings. No, this is different though,

2692
09:40:31,589 --> 09:40:35,349
because with the Lord of the Rings stream, I wasn't planning on streaming the next day.

2693
09:40:36,150 --> 09:40:54,199
I'm streaming today. I'm streaming today. So I'm done after this. All right, let's go.

2694
09:40:54,199 --> 09:41:16,569
You've got kids to take care of. It's not too bad. We're good. Don't get fucking, I can still get

2695
09:41:17,129 --> 09:41:33,139
trapped and killed. He used just waking up now. This is it. We're going to get a decent

2696
09:41:33,139 --> 09:41:38,019
unique right here. It'll carry me all the way through act three and then we can beat normal.

2697
09:41:38,019 --> 09:42:00,470
Hell. Hold on. There's an extra strong here.

2698
09:42:05,000 --> 09:42:14,919
Soul sludge. You're going to sneeze. I just got slapped in the face while I sneeze.

2699
09:42:15,739 --> 09:42:18,779
No, it's like, don't sneeze. Don't do it. Somebody just fucking cracked me.

2700
09:42:19,500 --> 09:43:09,050
Get in there. Kill. Oh, don't, don't fucking come after me. Don't fucking come after me.

2701
09:43:09,050 --> 09:43:36,680
Unique. Fuck. Fuck. All right. I'm out. Save. Just leave. See you tomorrow or later today,

2702
09:43:36,680 --> 09:43:43,449
whatever you want to call it. That was a lot of fun. I did not think I was going to get that far.

2703
09:43:43,690 --> 09:43:47,769
I thought that we were going to get destroyed. I thought I was going to make it through the first

2704
09:43:47,769 --> 09:44:01,419
two hours of the game, but it turns out still going. That's pretty good. We'll have to continue

2705
09:44:01,419 --> 09:44:18,260
that. So before we play that again, I'm going to try to do a better way to have you guys interact

2706
09:44:18,260 --> 09:44:23,830
with that instead of having weird images pop up on the screen. Good old fashioned coward strategies.

2707
09:44:23,830 --> 09:44:28,410
They work every time. Have you ever tried hardcore? That's not, that's the first time

2708
09:44:28,410 --> 09:44:35,540
I've ever played hardcore in any of the Diablo games. Never done it, but I thought it was great.

2709
09:44:36,180 --> 09:44:51,029
That was fun. Was it fun to stream? Yeah. I mean, games like this are easy to stream because,

2710
09:44:51,750 --> 09:44:57,879
I mean, yeah, it's hardcore and I don't want to die, but the menial minute to minute is we can

2711
09:44:57,879 --> 09:45:09,559
just talk about whatever, just chill and just do whatever. Nice change of pace. Game was just

2712
09:45:09,559 --> 09:45:21,580
playing itself, but let's, let's do the bits. I'm going to go through these fairly quickly

2713
09:45:22,220 --> 09:45:27,400
for obvious reasons, because it's getting very, very late. I'm not going to do it super duper,

2714
09:45:27,400 --> 09:45:31,319
insanely fast to the point where I blow through everyone's donations, but fast enough where we go

2715
09:45:31,879 --> 09:45:40,839
bing, bing, bing. And then tomorrow, I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

2716
09:45:41,480 --> 09:45:47,830
I have to talk to Joel. We'll see if tomorrow's going to be keep talking or it could be the next

2717
09:45:47,830 --> 09:45:53,349
day after that. I will let you know before the stream starts tomorrow. You will know.

2718
09:45:54,150 --> 09:46:03,750
All right, let's go. We had a thousand bits from acidic vengeance. They say for your Diablo 2

2719
09:46:03,750 --> 09:46:18,889
unban fund. Still can't believe that. I'm crazy. And I found that out 20 minutes before the stream

2720
09:46:18,889 --> 09:46:25,750
started. Oh, well, got like a scratchy voice today too. I don't know what's going on.

2721
09:46:26,550 --> 09:46:33,989
You can drink plenty of water. Weird. Thanks for the thousand bits. Potion dweller, thanks for the

2722
09:46:33,989 --> 09:46:41,589
250. Congrats on duping chat into one giving you necromancer, two giving you summons instead of

2723
09:46:41,589 --> 09:46:46,949
worthless curses. You may actually win this without dying now. Chat, I'm very disappointed

2724
09:46:46,949 --> 09:47:00,819
in you for not going throw barbarian. So many classes and so many combinations would have been so

2725
09:47:02,180 --> 09:47:10,870
terrible for this. Yes, potion find barbarian would have been the absolute worst thing possible.

2726
09:47:11,510 --> 09:47:22,699
I wouldn't have any moves. I would have to default click on people. This sucked.

2727
09:47:36,089 --> 09:47:43,910
A B Joe gave five thousand bits earlier. We, I think we said we talked about it, but they said

2728
09:47:43,910 --> 09:47:51,190
here's a pad, there's a paste bin here. It's a dream. Holy shit. This is long. I got a dream for

2729
09:47:51,190 --> 09:48:00,620
you. Let's see. Let me, this is very long. What happened? What did you eat before this dream?

2730
09:48:02,099 --> 09:48:05,220
Okay, I'm going to go through this because this is actually interesting to me.

2731
09:48:07,239 --> 09:48:10,279
I had a very odd dream the other night. This might be kind of long, but please bear with me.

2732
09:48:10,919 --> 09:48:15,720
It was evening and I had come home early. You had set up some sort of obstacle course at the

2733
09:48:15,720 --> 09:48:20,120
beach with all sorts of odd challenges. You're at the beginning of the obstacle course, ushering

2734
09:48:20,120 --> 09:48:23,959
people in with a big grin. When I tried to initiate a conversation, you ignored me.

2735
09:48:24,599 --> 09:48:28,919
I decided to carry on. There are many obstacles in your course. One of them, you had to drive an

2736
09:48:28,919 --> 09:48:33,639
actual train down some cartoon tracks at speeds that would in no way allow that train to remain

2737
09:48:33,639 --> 09:48:37,559
on said tracks. And in another, you literally just had to bend down and grab an empty can of

2738
09:48:37,559 --> 09:48:44,519
Monster Ultra with sunglasses drawn on paper taped to them and hand one over to Gabe Newell,

2739
09:48:45,160 --> 09:48:50,580
also wearing sunglasses who was apparently running that segment. After that, you had to slide up a

2740
09:48:50,580 --> 09:48:55,699
water slide to the top, which was about 50 feet tall and had to jump into the ocean to get back

2741
09:48:55,699 --> 09:49:00,739
down because landing in water doesn't give you fall damage. There were other people there also

2742
09:49:00,739 --> 09:49:04,180
attempting to complete your obstacle course, although I don't remember much about them other

2743
09:49:04,180 --> 09:49:18,790
than the fact that they were there. I was going through a, these dreams are becoming creative

2744
09:49:18,790 --> 09:49:34,279
writing exercises. Sorry, stop for a second. Where are we? Where were we? I went, I was going

2745
09:49:34,279 --> 09:49:41,559
through, okay, a jungle section, jungle gym section that you would find at one of those old McDonald's

2746
09:49:41,559 --> 09:49:48,180
play places. And I saw the kid in front of me go through a clear thin plastic roof above me

2747
09:49:48,260 --> 09:49:52,580
that had air holes poked in it. I asked him how he did that. And he asked me if I had the right

2748
09:49:52,580 --> 09:49:57,139
version. I said, I didn't know. He told me that I needed the right version of the map to continue

2749
09:49:57,139 --> 09:50:01,139
this section of the challenges. That was the way through. I had no idea what he was talking about.

2750
09:50:01,139 --> 09:50:05,059
So I did the only thing that came to mind and cut through the plastic with a serrated pocket knife

2751
09:50:05,059 --> 09:50:12,580
I had on my person, telling the kid to be careful as he was still there, even handing it over at

2752
09:50:12,580 --> 09:50:17,220
some point, telling him where to cut as he couldn't see what he was cutting because we were on different

2753
09:50:17,220 --> 09:50:26,470
versions of the say of the game. After that, I had run into another obstacle later down the line

2754
09:50:26,470 --> 09:50:30,150
and the same kid showed up and asked me which power up I had chosen at the station at the beginning

2755
09:50:30,150 --> 09:50:36,550
of the obstacle course that you had manned. I said I didn't have one. He said you need to choose one

2756
09:50:36,550 --> 09:50:41,989
to complete the obstacle course. He then T posed over a pit of mud that was in our way. Not sure

2757
09:50:41,989 --> 09:50:47,029
what to do next. I decided that I was going to probably like going around probably wouldn't hurt

2758
09:50:47,029 --> 09:50:51,430
anyone but as soon as I did a bunch of germa sun surrounded me and forced me back on the path and

2759
09:50:51,430 --> 09:50:58,059
people behind me booed until I tried jumping over it only to fall to my death. It was at this moment

2760
09:50:58,059 --> 09:51:02,699
that I had awoken in my bed in a cold sweat. I keep a dream journal so I wrote this down as soon

2761
09:51:02,699 --> 09:51:06,459
as I could and looking back on it now I think it looks like I had a stroke or something.

2762
09:51:07,099 --> 09:51:10,620
Looking forward to my second go-around hopefully next time I can get past the mud pit.

2763
09:51:19,819 --> 09:51:21,739
Fake dream feels weird.

2764
09:51:27,750 --> 09:51:35,830
Dreams are so fucked up you never know. It could be completely real. That sounds pretty

2765
09:51:35,830 --> 09:51:42,730
that could be accurate. Keeping a dream journal is the most fun things you can do. Well you heard

2766
09:51:42,730 --> 09:51:47,290
the dream about the tigers in the plane and shit like that. The only reason I even remember that

2767
09:51:47,290 --> 09:51:59,910
happened is because I wrote it down. So yeah I didn't did this this wild shit happens. Snarbosis

2768
09:52:00,709 --> 09:52:06,819
thanks for the 10 community subs. 20 from Zap. We caught Zaps I remember that. We didn't see

2769
09:52:06,819 --> 09:52:19,510
Snarbosis. Thanks both of you. Friedl Schlitz. Thanks for the 250. Can you tell me to stop

2770
09:52:19,510 --> 09:52:25,370
procrastinating and go do my homework. Oh yes get out go go get out of here go. What are you

2771
09:52:25,370 --> 09:52:33,669
doing still here? Oh wait this is like eight hours ago. I hope you did it. I hope you did.

2772
09:52:35,660 --> 09:52:47,050
Futanari thanks for the 1500 bits. Yay mountain stream. Potion dweller thanks for the 250. I

2773
09:52:47,050 --> 09:52:50,970
apologize to chat as it's clear they wanted to keep you alive. Now that's out of the way you

2774
09:52:50,970 --> 09:52:58,230
owe to yourself to try Path of Exile. I've played Path of Exile before. I do not like it. The reason

2775
09:52:58,230 --> 09:53:04,870
I do not like it is I do not like the camera. I think the camera I don't like it's kind of close

2776
09:53:04,870 --> 09:53:11,400
and too high. It's one of the only pet peeves I have of the whole game. I do not like the camera

2777
09:53:11,400 --> 09:53:28,309
in Path of Exile. That's it. I've tried to play it two or three times now. Sad camera noises.

2778
09:53:28,949 --> 09:53:41,019
Remember you just said a porn term. What? I don't know. How am I supposed to know what porn terms

2779
09:53:41,019 --> 09:53:58,839
are? Okay whatever whatever. All right fine fine sure. All right. Havgon thanks for the 250. Hey

2780
09:53:58,839 --> 09:54:04,680
Mr. Albertson. Chat keeps telling me to watch the streamer called German985. The stream is bland

2781
09:54:04,680 --> 09:54:09,000
and his fans only like him because they have Stockholm syndrome. Watch this other streamer

2782
09:54:09,000 --> 09:54:16,540
called BF Bugleberry instead. He only does 11 minute streams. Now that the joke is over I think

2783
09:54:16,540 --> 09:54:32,599
you should watch Jojo at some point. Also watch Redline. We had a long conversation about Jojo.

2784
09:54:32,599 --> 09:54:37,239
Listen to my voice right now. This is kind of fucked up. Why? I know you just heard like an

2785
09:54:37,239 --> 09:54:46,339
explosion or like a gunshot in my room. That was a battery. Nine hours? No it was like this before

2786
09:54:46,339 --> 09:54:54,739
too. It was like this like six or seven hours ago. It's my throat. I can I can feel it. I don't know

2787
09:54:54,739 --> 09:55:11,800
why. Oh yeah we talked about Jojo already. My anime for 2020 is what was it? Ping pong. Yeah

2788
09:55:11,800 --> 09:55:20,489
that's what it was. Ping pong. We deliberated for a while. Incendiary thanks for the 10 community

2789
09:55:20,489 --> 09:55:32,550
subs. Appreciate it. 10 subs. A lot of money. People drop five and ten subs in this channel.

2790
09:55:33,879 --> 09:55:39,800
Dozens of times a stream. Just 10, 10, 10, 10, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20, 20.

2791
09:55:40,519 --> 09:55:48,550
You guys are really fucking generous. Thank you. Cell juniors thanks for the 500 bits. Sending

2792
09:55:48,550 --> 09:55:54,790
love and support to all trans people in chat. Very good. Thanks for the 500 bits. I appreciate it.

2793
09:55:59,080 --> 09:56:12,699
All the love. Thanks for the 500 bits. Espada Escalada 250 doing this for the channel points.

2794
09:56:13,260 --> 09:56:24,900
What do you mean channel points? 250? What do you get? You get channel points for giving bits?

2795
09:56:28,169 --> 09:56:30,650
Is that how some of you guys have gotten to 75,000 so fast?

2796
09:56:31,290 --> 09:56:48,410
Holy shit. I didn't know that. Once a month. Oh okay. Oh that's cool. Phylactery gave $50 and

2797
09:56:48,410 --> 09:56:53,209
they said Germ of the Ridge is fucking $75. But Phylactery thank you for almost buying me a second

2798
09:56:53,209 --> 09:56:59,300
one. I need a second one. This time I'm gonna get the the chrome one. I like that one. I was

2799
09:56:59,300 --> 09:57:10,230
gonna get that one. There's another link. Where? Oh there wasn't. Oh my fucking god somebody actually

2800
09:57:10,230 --> 09:57:30,089
did. You guys getting this shit so fast. What a shitty fucking thing for channel points.

2801
09:57:30,650 --> 09:57:43,819
I'm realizing this now. What a bad thing for channel points. We will continue.

2802
09:57:49,099 --> 09:58:06,250
Hey but thank you Phylactery for the 5,000 bits. $50. Phylactery gives money. An insane amount of

2803
09:58:06,250 --> 09:58:18,660
money. Almost every single stream. Every single fucking time. Thanks Phylactery again. And always.

2804
09:58:19,620 --> 09:58:21,879
Appreciate it.

2805
09:58:30,360 --> 09:58:43,930
No. It'd be a pan-seared salmon. Pan-seared salmon with lemon and oil. Good.

2806
09:58:49,239 --> 09:58:52,709
How would I drink oil?

2807
09:59:08,309 --> 09:59:13,830
Bananas are all I eat now. All day. Every day. 365 days a year. I eat sleep and breathe bananas.

2808
09:59:13,830 --> 09:59:20,889
Thanks again. You've changed my life forever. You learned that eating bananas is all you have to do?

2809
09:59:21,690 --> 09:59:35,610
Don't eat too many. You'll get radioactive. Deadly SP. Thanks for the 1,500 bits. $15.

2810
09:59:37,290 --> 09:59:42,250
Jeremy it's me Alex Cora. Why the hell haven't you answered my calls? Things aren't good Jeremy. I

2811
09:59:42,250 --> 09:59:46,250
had to step down because of you. You said no one was going to find out. You said it was going to

2812
09:59:46,250 --> 09:59:51,370
work out. The commissioner thinks I'm the one who came up with this. But I'm going to tell the truth.

2813
09:59:51,370 --> 09:59:55,129
I'm going to tell the whole world that you, German985, were the one who came up with the

2814
09:59:55,129 --> 10:00:04,620
sign stealing. Even your buddy Chat can't stop me. You won't. I gotta go out of this. Half the people

2815
10:00:04,620 --> 10:00:22,019
in this chat don't know what you're talking about. I do. Zeroni thanks for the $10,000 bits. Jeremy

2816
10:00:22,019 --> 10:00:27,559
it's Andrew from Ridge Wallet. We're having trouble with the corporate account so we're disbursing your

2817
10:00:27,559 --> 10:00:31,800
first payment in bits. The whole team is looking forward to your next endorsement. Thanks for the

2818
10:00:31,800 --> 10:00:48,889
$10. It is like a nice wallet. It's clean. It's sleek. I know there's a buzzword for when you

2819
10:00:48,889 --> 10:00:53,370
bought something that was expensive but I really do like these and I've used stuff like this before.

2820
10:00:54,089 --> 10:00:58,489
I've used a wallet that was supposed to be a little tiny little steel wallet before

2821
10:00:58,489 --> 10:01:09,370
and I think it was a piece of shit. This thing is not a piece of shit. Clean. It's nice. High grade

2822
10:01:09,370 --> 10:01:21,370
steel. Hey oh wait wait wait wait wait. Those of you that have been to Las Vegas that took me up

2823
10:01:21,370 --> 10:01:28,540
on my go-to hash house of gogo in the link and get the blue cheese burger. I know at least six or

2824
10:01:28,540 --> 10:01:35,290
seven people have done that over the last year and what did they come back and say? What did they come

2825
10:01:35,290 --> 10:01:46,839
back and say? Oh that that was the best that was the best thing I've ever eaten in my life. So I'm

2826
10:01:46,839 --> 10:02:01,300
not bullshitting here. This is a good wallet. You can trust me. Trust me. Blue cheese is gross. I'm

2827
10:02:01,300 --> 10:02:07,900
sorry. You don't have to apologize for being incorrect. You just have to be feel ashamed

2828
10:02:07,900 --> 10:02:20,680
in what you said was wrong. Thank you too. Oh we had another one. Mr. Mr. Goido thanks for the

2829
10:02:20,680 --> 10:02:26,040
$2.50. I had a dream that Jerma drank his own piss on stream haha. Oh my god why are there so many

2830
10:02:26,120 --> 10:02:42,279
of these today? Look how annoyed I look. Hey it's been 10 hours. We just crossed 10 hours.

2831
10:02:50,459 --> 10:02:55,690
Uh let's get the credits on screen. I have no idea what's gonna happen tomorrow.

2832
10:02:56,250 --> 10:03:05,559
Hopefully I wake up. I should. Money changed this guy. He used to be so fucking nicer. He was so

2833
10:03:05,559 --> 10:03:12,650
much cooler. He didn't have ridge wallets. He didn't drink Fiji water. He didn't buy original

2834
10:03:12,650 --> 10:03:20,620
hardware to play his Wii games on. I don't even remember the last time that I heard him sneeze.

2835
10:03:21,339 --> 10:03:28,949
Come on. Come on. Damn it. Oh that would have been funny. It would have been funny. It seems

2836
10:03:28,949 --> 10:03:41,959
it's coming on. It's okay. That would have been fun. Uh let's get the credits rolling. Like I said

2837
10:03:41,959 --> 10:03:52,860
before thanks for all the subs everybody. That dream is really fucked up. Old Jerma would have

2838
10:03:52,860 --> 10:04:00,139
sneezed. Yeah we'll see what we do tomorrow. I gotta um let me look. If me and Joel don't do

2839
10:04:00,139 --> 10:04:13,720
anything tomorrow and we do it the next day it's not much good shit over here. There's so much

2840
10:04:13,720 --> 10:04:20,949
good stuff over here. I don't even know what to choose. There's so many good games. Deadly creatures

2841
10:04:20,949 --> 10:04:35,459
for the Wii. We play the fucking scorpion. I don't know. We'll see. We'll figure it out.

2842
10:04:39,699 --> 10:04:49,319
Uh but anyway the credits are supposed to be on. What the hell am I doing? Is tomorrow gonna be

2843
10:04:49,319 --> 10:04:56,150
more D2? Uh we'll probably take a break from it. This was a long session here. So uh 10 hours of

2844
10:04:56,150 --> 10:05:12,699
Diablo 2. I don't want to have Diablo 2 exhaustion. We will probably do Diablo 2 again um at some

2845
10:05:12,699 --> 10:05:23,449
point this weekend probably. Why are the credits not rolling? What time's the stream gonna be

2846
10:05:23,449 --> 10:05:30,629
tomorrow? Well I have to eat. I'm probably not gonna get to bed till about uh I'm probably not

2847
10:05:30,629 --> 10:05:36,389
gonna get to bed till about three. So I don't think this is gonna be like a 1 pm or a 12 pm stream

2848
10:05:36,389 --> 10:05:49,050
tomorrow. So I gotta talk to Joel too. Is Joel is uh is he streaming? Streaming right now? Okay.

2849
10:05:49,849 --> 10:06:01,910
I wonder if he said anything on Discord. Let me just check. It's not rolling. I'm getting

2850
10:06:01,910 --> 10:06:08,150
set. There they are. And they're incredibly fast. Glory. All right uh let's see. Anything on Discord

2851
10:06:08,150 --> 10:06:14,779
from Joel? Thanks again everybody. Seriously. Another long one. But this was long because I

2852
10:06:14,779 --> 10:06:37,209
was kind of addicted to the game. Uh last thing that we said was. Let me see. We said uh I just

2853
10:06:37,209 --> 10:06:42,870
have my computer upgraded. I have a ton of issues. All right so we'll see. I'll be around the next

2854
10:06:42,870 --> 10:06:55,750
few days. All right yeah we'll let me just hit him a line. I'm gonna say I'm gonna be around

2855
10:06:55,750 --> 10:07:09,000
tomorrow the next day whatever's better for you. And then we'll go from there. Uh bits just came

2856
10:07:09,000 --> 10:07:15,750
in right now. Or a couple minutes ago. It was uh Flugboy. What's going on Flugboy? Thanks for the

2857
10:07:15,750 --> 10:07:23,370
thousand bits. Ten dollars right at the end here. They say hey Jerma gonna drop you some moderately

2858
10:07:23,370 --> 10:07:27,290
sized bits tonight. It's always kind of weird to me that I've been watching you for this long and

2859
10:07:27,290 --> 10:07:34,230
it's always wonderful to see new people. I agree. I love seeing new people. It was this huge Destiny

2860
10:07:34,230 --> 10:07:38,870
puzzle that came out recently and it brought literally the entire community's heads together

2861
10:07:39,510 --> 10:07:44,389
and it kind of reminds me of the hive mind that is chat that pulls together to just poke some fun

2862
10:07:44,389 --> 10:07:51,139
of you. It's really amazing. Keep up everything you do. It's always nice to talk to you. That's

2863
10:07:51,139 --> 10:08:04,949
part of the fun. Thanks a lot Flugboy. That's part of the fun though. The splendor of the piss Birky.

2864
10:08:07,660 --> 10:08:13,019
All right good night guys. I'll see you tomorrow. Whether we do uh keep talking or something else.

2865
10:08:13,739 --> 10:08:18,860
I'll be around tomorrow afternoon. Once uh I figure out what's going on,

2866
10:08:18,860 --> 10:08:25,029
this stuff will be updated accordingly and I'll see you tomorrow or later today.

2867
10:08:25,750 --> 10:08:52,809
Good night guys. Take care. See you soon.
