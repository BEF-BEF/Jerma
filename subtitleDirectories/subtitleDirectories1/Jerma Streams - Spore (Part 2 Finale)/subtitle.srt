1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:12,500
Right on time. That's right. You guys bet on this one? Okay. So, uh, the reason I tried to be very,

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:19,929
very on time today, because I- I don't know, I thought people were betting on this. So I freaked

3
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:25,780
out like two, three minutes ago. I was brushing my teeth. I'm just like, oh fuck, what are they

4
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:32,179
betting on this? And I like, oh shit, and I like sprinted. I got in here as fast as I could. I

5
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:36,340
turned it on. Because I was like, what if people have- people have channel points on this? I don't

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:47,429
know. I guess not. You know, it's like funny. When I think that people are betting fake currency on

7
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,590
something and like gambling, I'm incredibly interested and I'm going to be right on time.

8
00:00:52,229 --> 00:01:03,929
It's interesting. You have a good dirty teeth. Uh, I like to brush my teeth for every stream.

9
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:15,769
I have a nice like clean, fresh mouth. I hate the fact of having a dirty mouth. When I'm sitting

10
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:22,790
down talking, I hate that feeling. I can feel all individual, every tooth. It's just like slime on

11
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:31,780
it. And I can, like, my breath is heavy and dense. Blah. I hate it. Especially when you're talking,

12
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:41,370
you can like, you can feel that heavy air. Blah. Get rid of it. I hate it. Brush your teeth on

13
00:01:41,370 --> 00:02:18,259
stream. I just did. All right, give me a sec. Beer back. Gonna tweet this. Did I get that right?

14
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,400
Okay. I don't know why, but for some reason, I thought I spelled my Twitch channel wrong.

15
00:02:25,400 --> 00:03:08,379
Where are my headphones? Fuck. Hold on. I'll be right back. All right, I got it. So today,

16
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,919
we are going to play, uh, probably the remainder of what we're going to do in Spore.

17
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:25,800
Can I hear anything? Let me see. Hold on. I can't hear anything. There we go. All right,

18
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,939
and now I can hear you. You're not even talking. Oh, now I can hear you. Uh, yeah, we're gonna play

19
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:43,939
Spore. What is this title, bro? Uh, that's Jeremiah 420. It's, I don't know. We were in

20
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:50,250
pre-stream and somebody thought it was a good idea. It makes sense. I guess it's perfect for today.

21
00:03:52,819 --> 00:04:04,939
You're muted? Do a tooth cam. No, I'm not putting a cam. Look, I am not putting my teeth in the

22
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:12,419
camera. I'm not putting my, like, nose in the camera. I'm not gonna, like, put my feet in the

23
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,220
camera. I'm not gonna, like, show you my elbows. No, I'm not, I'm gonna, I'm a fucking statue in

24
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,250
this scene. I'm not doing, I don't want, I'm not doing any of that. I'm not gonna, like, oh, dude,

25
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,850
open your mouth and show us, like, your, all of your teeth. Go like this and pull the teeth, like,

26
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,050
pull your cheeks out and go, ah. It's gonna be wicked funny. Just do it. I'm not doing that.

27
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,060
Anytime somebody tells you something, something, something, dash, it'll be wicked funny. I don't

28
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:52,810
know if I trust that person. I don't trust that. I was just gonna say, it'll be wicked funny.

29
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,240
Why do you want me to do that so bad? You think, you think that you're kind of bouncing off of me.

30
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,720
I think that I'll think what you just said is funny because it's, it's a pretty odd request.

31
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,519
So therefore, it might be funny. I might think it's funny, but you don't think it's funny.

32
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:18,439
I think I get you. I understand you. Play Spore. It'll be wicked funny.

33
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:34,329
Play the game. It'll be wicked funny. Shit. He has wooden teeth. That's why. Federal Reserve

34
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:41,639
bailed you out. No, they didn't. No more. What are you talking about? All right, let's go.

35
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:49,800
Dude, you should totally like eat a bunch of grapes and like food with your hands and like

37
00:05:53,079 --> 00:06:03,240
your mouth and stuff. It'll be wicked funny. I gotta watch out now. I gotta watch out for,

38
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,290
it'll be wicked funny people. I have to watch out for that now. Here we go. Camera's not on, right?

41
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:42,139
All right, here we are on the planet Zircon. Like I'm so glad this doesn't pop up very often.

42
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:49,740
I kind of care about this. Like it's just, that's so default wallpaper Andy. We went over this

43
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,899
yesterday. Oh, by the way, you notice how like I've dragged everything off. It's just a

44
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:03,589
background. Every time I know I'm going to capture my desktop, it's like, well, click drag over to

45
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:09,300
the other monitor. You don't want you to see any of that shit. Oh guys, I have just like a clean

46
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,779
desktop. I don't have anything. I don't even use a computer. It's just desktop wallpaper. I don't

47
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:20,439

48
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:26,149
You do the same thing. You did the same exact thing. If you know someone's coming over

49
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,220

little while. I'm not going to have access to my computer. Can I use yours? Oh my fucking God. It's

53
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,540
It's like panic and I for no reason to like this. I I don't like there's nothing on this computer

54
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,329
That's like bad. It's just like I don't know it feels weird feels like somebody's like sitting in your skin

Doesn't it feels like somebody's like sitting in your body like in like is your bones like controlling your hands and stuff

56
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:17,019

It feels the same way even though the second bad in my house or anything quick take everything out of the fridge

61
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:47,320
But I don't know. It's a guy. It's just weird. It's a Zorn. It's Zorn. No

62
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:59,779
It's not Zorn related. Okay. Here we go. We're at the tribe of those who that missed yesterday's stream

00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:13,659
He liked it. You have too many domesticated animals at this time. What is happening? What are we doing?

104
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:24,090
What am I doing to him? Am I stealing this guy? Wait, I'm

105
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,889

Oh, this is gonna be awkward

115
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:54,039
This is this is when you order like uber eats from three different places because you want like a sampling of three different places

116
00:16:54,039 --> 00:17:00,769
That day like three uber each drivers show up at the same time. I promise it's not a prank

117
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:21,750
I just wanted to read you I wanted to sample three different foods. Have we friends who does that? I don't I'm making it up

118
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,759
I

119
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:37,019
Don't do that. I do not order from three different places to have a sampling of three different foods

120
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:48,549
I think 85% of every uber eats order I've ever done was McDonald's and I'm

121
00:17:49,470 --> 00:18:07,339
90% sure that that's accurate. That's disgusting. Why is that disgusting? That's way too specific. He does that I

122
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
Don't fucking do that

123
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:17,150
Okay

124
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,829

127
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,759
I love McDonald's. I love that place. I

128
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,069
Really do I love McDonald's?

129
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:50,240
How many times I have to say that before people think it's true

130
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:58,789
Like the eggs you dipshit what eggs eggs

131
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:12,319

Next to your domesticated animals. What they're laying eggs in here

133
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,940
Okay. All right. Let me make a musical instrument place and press neighboring tries with these horns

134
00:19:44,339 --> 00:20:02,180
Mmm over here. This will be the music hut egg time. I do like McDonald's a lot

135
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
It's like one of my favorite places to eat

136
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,119
It really is

137
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:15,509

138
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:22,700
Where's it going with it? Oh shit. Nice. Okay. I need fuck a 44 food. What else can I do now?

139
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:25,450
One is better than McDonald's

140
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:33,900
Right, but I mean, I don't care though. There are a lot of places better than McDonald's, but that doesn't

141
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,259
Take away from the fact that I eat there all the time. I mean should I make an instrument?

142
00:20:46,880 --> 00:21:03,460
Why not? I can't but why not weapons? Ooh, that's the chief. Oh, okay

143
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:14,700
Alright, so I got a horn. All right, you get a horn too. I'd much rather eat a Burger King Whopper than a stinky Big Mac

144
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:29,589
Yuck. That's all right. Grab a horn. We're gonna go impress the village. I need a I need the chief

145
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:36,569
Don't I? Chief come with me wooden horns. You can only use that ability during performance. All right, let's go

146
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:50,279
Who actually eats in at McDonald's? Oh, I didn't say I didn't say I was eating in the restaurant

147
00:21:50,279 --> 00:22:07,730
I mean you can what's wrong with that? All right, here we go. It's time to play some music. Here we go

148
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:17,700
Oh, they love it. You like this

149
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,279
They love that. We are now friends

150
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:38,250
Alright, so now we're friends

151
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:43,849
We need to be allies with them though. I would keep doing it. Maybe she could move people with horns

152
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:53,980
Oh, they want the horns. Okay. I see they want horns again. I want it again

153
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:08,940
Not enough. Oh, I got it. Alright, the new tribe is your ally. They love it

154
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:22,630
I like McDonald's. I like Burger King. I like Wendy's but if I have a choice in the matter, it's McDonald's

155
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:28,819
I don't know. I just like their I like this. I know exactly what to order there

156
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:32,250
I go to Burger King. I don't know what to order

157
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:36,859
And I go I don't fucking know and I put my glasses on and lean into the menu and I go which one is good here

158
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:44,490
Wendy's I usually get a junior bacon cheeseburger problem with that though. I got a problem with that. It's always cold

159
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:51,769
I've never ever experienced a hot junior bacon cheeseburger from Wendy's. It is always cold every single time

160
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:55,940
It's very good. It tastes very good, but it's cold every

161
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:03,960
Single time i've ever eaten it in 20 fucking years of going there across states across the entire nation

162
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,900
Across all of the united states of america

163
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:15,640
It's like that every time and I don't know why but it's very it tastes very good. I guess i'm new. Oh, wait

164
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:25,589
What did that say?

165
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,589
Your mouth is too warm

166
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:39,430
Does that look like an extremely hot mouth? That's what it is now. I've had

167
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,150
Burgers from mcdonald's that were cold. I've had big macs that were just lukewarm in the middle

168
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,640
But not every time your tribe grows in prestige

169
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,559
You have a larger hut to show for it and your tribe can now sustain up to nine tribe members

170
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:59,079
All right, cool. Let's get some more babies babies

171
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:15,720
More babies and let's get some food big mac or quarter pounder. I prefer a big mac

172
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,660
Uh, okay. I think i'm good, right? Where is everybody? All right, everybody get over here

173
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,660
We get some we chop down some trees

174
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:39,579
We need more food if garbage tastes

175
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:42,059
I don't like but does it really matter though?

176
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,619
I really go over this

177
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,619
All fast food is gross

178
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:49,980
It just is

179
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:57,740
Does it really matter if you like burger king or mcdonald's more like they're both gross in their own ways

180
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:05,670
But it's delicious and yummy and quick and usually pretty affordable and it's really easy. It doesn't really matter

181
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,180
But honestly the affordable part i'm not so sure of anymore

182
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:21,500
I've been to mcdonald's a lot of times and the order like if you got like two there's like two or three people in the car

183
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,740
It's like okay, we're gonna get this we're gonna get that okay, and okay, that'll be like 28 dollars drive around

184
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,519
Please it's like wait. What how much should we order?

185
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,940
We order how much do we order? That's a lot of food. No, it's not was it

186
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:42,390
You can go like down the street to a place. It's not like a mcdonald's and it's like 20 bucks to eat

187
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,750
Like I've really got two three people in a car. It's like really what's going on here?

188
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:52,220
Like 35 dollars for us to order like a bunch of a couple of meals

189
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:58,779
It's not four fucking dollars like for like 15 items

190
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:06,470
I'm put up saying like there are other restaurants that are not mcdonald's that are better than mcdonald's where you can get food for cheaper

191
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:13,910
exist

192
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:18,500
Why is everybody holding eggs return the eggs?

193
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,119
Why put the eggs in here?

194
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,640
And then why would you get mcdonald's because it takes 10 seconds to get your food

195
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,430
All right, everybody I need to expand

196
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,420
Can I just do we get weapons?

197
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:56,519

00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:44,259
I'm gonna send you on a great exploration to pick up a rock

244
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,220
And throw it as hard as you can over at somebody's head at the other village

245
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:53,930
And then what I want you to do is I want you to hide behind a bush

246
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:58,009

247
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740

Um, I just focus every single unit on one person at a time

255
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:45,180
Like this, I don't like press a attack move and then click over here. Nope. We kill one person at a time instantly

256
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,779
We just firing squad one person at a time

What isn't that one of my people? That's a traitor

300
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:12,420

301
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,800
You have destroyed the pink village your tribe has carved a second totem piece to remember this momentous occasion

302
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,420
It spoils the battle and now tools and outfits

303
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,420
Find them in your tribal planner. What are you doing here?

304
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:46,329
We're gonna eat them

305
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:47,210
Okay

306
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,210
Well, I took over the village. Let's go

307
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,739
I need some can I just take anything? Can I steal anything else?

00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,699
Everybody go back an epic gecko

314
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:26,780
Funny thing happened

315
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,099
When it's one time what the tagline should have been

316
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,139
Me my crazy old me said it should be 15 saved you 50 percent more. Have you seen that commercial?

317
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:38,619
Can they can they stop fucking doing that already?

318
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Stop doing that

319
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:45,539
Stop doing that commercial

320
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,300
They keep doing that commercial. They keep doing like the gecko is a real person

321
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,239
You guys pick up on that yet?

322
00:39:55,239 --> 00:40:00,280
They're doing like the geico gecko is a real guy behind the scenes. He's a real person. It's not like a lizard

323
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,670
actor

324
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,090
Why are you doing that?

325
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:10,090
They like have like people chattering in the background like pretending there's like a set and stuff and he's like, oh, yeah

Oh, I can't keep i keep laughing at you mate. You're so funny over there

327
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,329
Why are they making him a real person?

328
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,809
It's weird and that's the whole commercial. There's no commercial

329
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:26,039
He just like acts like kind of like ah candidly behind the scenes, huh? They've done like three or four of those

330
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,579

331
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:36,679
But it's not like behind the scenes. This is the actor talking behind the scenes

332
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,199
It's the geico gecko is in front of the camera and we're on set and the gecko is real

Wait, why are we all fucked up? What's wrong with us? It's your friend. No, it's not

352
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,309

356
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,809
It's just a button down. There's a button down here that says beast master

357
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:59,590
I have no idea what it is

358
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:05,219

00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:15,539
What are we doing?

360
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:21,590
What does this do?

361
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,670

Aggressive aggressive tribes try to exterminate the competition. They ruthlessly attack and hoard all the resources for themselves

00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,739
That's not what happened though. People are attacking me

380
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:51,380
Are we watching the same game? Are we playing the same game?

00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:02,730
All right

456

Okay, get a gift. How do I get a gift? Your tribe is doomed. They are not

Let's go here. We have a gift. This is for the chief

589
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:34,309
I know we've had our problems. We've had our differences

590
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:38,139
We've killed way more people than you

591
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:42,139
You've lost way more people than we have we've had our differences

592
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:47,579
In fact, i'm not sure one person has died on our tribe, but I know a lot from yours have

Take the deal. I can't tell if he's trying to sneak or if he's about to wipe out this whole village

595
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:14,170
What is that?

596
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:19,420
All right. Let's try it. We have

597
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,800

606

That was just bad rng. We'll get it bad rng. I'll get it end their lives

608
01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:45,590
No, i'm trying to be in the middle there. I don't want to be aggressive into the next stage

Should we just go kill that thing? Maybe together we should just go wipe that thing out

614
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:22,149
All right, so far so good. Just give me one more

This guy's freaking me out though

635
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:24,979
I think that that's the tribal stage, right?

636
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:40,840
Does that bring us up into the middle and we should definitely go get the big guy

637
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:48,779
You made the cyan village your allies your totem is complete

638
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,420

639
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:56,840
Your tribe reigns supreme when you're ready to get civilized click the advance button

640
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:04,489
Click here to found your first city. You'll be sent to the creators to design your city hall and vehicles

641
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,859
Kill the pickle. I'm just curious about him. Hold on

642
01:13:23,369 --> 01:13:30,659

645
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:32,090
Lavender village is offering you a gift. I think i'm ready. Yeah, but there's nothing I can really do here

646
01:14:32,569 --> 01:14:37,430
Did I get into the middle?

647
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,609
I did

648
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:39,989
industrious

649
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:45,270
Industrious tribe sees the moment attacking or forming alliances when necessary. They make great allies, but watch out

650
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,000
Uh, let's go

651
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,710
Your tribal tactics have established you earliest cultural trait. This trait sets the course for your nation's specialty and the technological research

652
01:14:57,779 --> 01:15:03,619
As your nation grows your citizens will develop unique tools that will assist your civilization on the path the global domination use them wisely

653
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:15,560
Very cool. I spent a lot of time down here. I'm not friendly at all, though. Let's go

654
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:27,180
I'm for civilization

655
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:32,939
The tribe now dominates this continent ready to advance from simple village life to civilized city living ahead of the rest

656
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:40,500
I guess so. So what am I making here? Name your city hall?

657
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:57,210
I mean we're civilized doesn't mean we know very much like we're still kind of like dumb, right?

658
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:09,380
No, i've never gone this far. I don't think

659
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:10,899

660
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:16,020

661
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,180

662
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:25,819

01:18:45,609 --> 01:18:56,180
Hmm, it's gonna be a cake. I'm gonna make a big wedding cake

681
01:19:20,119 --> 01:19:22,119
Uh, and then there's usually like a little thing on top

Whoa. Whoa, that was cool. I'm not done. These roofs. Whoa. It's a big berry

Yeah, it's like oozing over the top. This is a bird bath. It's not a bird bath

684
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:38,489
It's I'm not good at this. I can't do like infrastructure and like architecture

685
01:20:46,680 --> 01:21:00,649
Cool windows. I don't do infrastructure. I don't this is not the job for me off center. I got it. Hold on

690
01:21:59,189 --> 01:22:03,430
Where stuff just falls from the top of the screen and you have to go left and right to try to

691
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:15,539
Stack it so it doesn't fall. I mean, I don't hate that though. I do but I don't at the same time

692
01:22:15,779 --> 01:22:22,199
Maybe a little bit. No, it's got to be bigger. Yeah, it's got to be like that

712
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:45,560
Okay, I gotta relax. It needs a little more substance over here. Look at that. It's perfect

713
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:55,779
It's perfect. It is if this could be like red and this could be white and this could be like vanilla

714
01:26:55,779 --> 01:27:46,149
It's got a strawberry shortcake. I win just to color it. Hold on an acorn. Nope. Can't put anything on top of that

715
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,689
It's not a butt plug

716
01:27:49,689 --> 01:28:01,659
Stop i'm keep seeing that and it's making me very upset. I need a whip. It's like a dollop of whipped cream

717
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:07,210
Not that make it thinner a little dollop of whipped cream and then I need a cherry on top of that

718
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:12,890
Like let me do the stupid thing I want to do or i'm gonna be very mad. Oh fine. This can be that

719
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:16,659
No, I want this to be

720
01:28:16,739 --> 01:28:36,140
Cherry, is it too high? It's too high

721
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,760
Wrong category. Oh

722
01:28:42,760 --> 01:29:04,100
Oh, hold on too high too high too high too high. Is it heart limit? I don't think so

723
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,560
Not too high. Okay

724
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:20,539
Gonna have to go to details. Yeah, it's I can't put any more on you can't put a detail on top of a detail

725
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:34,760
Um, well

726
01:29:34,760 --> 01:30:06,630
Um, no, no, wait, can't make it smaller. I can't make it smaller as small as it can go. Oh, whatever

727
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,710
I'll just put it on there and it could be uh

728
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:30,699
Like it could be a cherry. That's a good cherry this I think that look that could be a cherry first in the fifth row

729
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:42,489
One two, three, four five donut. Dude. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You sit down for just a second. Everybody relax

730
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:50,010

01:30:50,010 --> 01:31:28,939
Whip cream done people really asking me how this is whipped cream. Give me a minute. Give me one second

732
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:34,460
Like I have you're gonna watch the artist paint and when he does a stroke you say it looks horrible

733
01:31:34,460 --> 01:32:26,069
You have to let him wait. Let him paint the painting. Let him paint the painting first. Make sure they're overlapping enough

734
01:32:26,310 --> 01:33:01,989
It's pretty good. It looks better over here though. Hold on. Hell. Yeah, look at that

735
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:14,250
There's your whipped cream and there's a cherry and these are gonna be

736
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:17,689
Like yellow like a cake. It's gonna be a strawberry shortcake

737
01:33:18,739 --> 01:33:32,810
I don't even care what building this is anymore bottom left stem very needs a stem cherry needs a stem

738
01:33:34,010 --> 01:34:38,420
Does it know does it know? No, let the artist work you skinnier. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah a bit longer

739
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:44,789
You think how long cherry stems not that cherry stems not that long bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom left bottom left

740
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:56,119
Oh, that's what you mean. Wait, does this one bend does this one bend? Okay, that's better. Yeah, it is better

741
01:34:56,279 --> 01:35:28,899
Oh, that's so much better. Hell. Yeah, I love it. I spin it and go I want everyone that

742
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:50,409
Um was angry that I was making like a dessert building where you know, they left it. All right. Here we go paintbrush mode

01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:56,680
Oh my god. Yes. Oh my god. I'm gonna be here for an hour. Oh my god. Oh my god

744
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:07,109
All right. We need a whipped cream. We need red for the cherry. We need cherry red, which is like the most

745
01:36:07,829 --> 01:36:16,140
Um, like the best keyboard you can get for a mechanical keyboard, right? Oh dear

746
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:39,189
Um, wait, hold on. I paint it. Yeah paint it. I can't click. Um, I can't paint this

747
01:36:39,430 --> 01:37:01,609
Oh, it has to be I have to have a texture. Okay, the stem is like a uh, like what was the stem make it glossy

748
01:37:01,689 --> 01:37:12,279
I hold on. This is very important. You're right. Is it like brown black? Is it purple or is the stem on a cherry?

749
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:30,970
That's not purple. Yeah, it's like a dark. Um, like down here right a little bit darker. It's green

750
01:37:31,210 --> 01:38:02,500
What color is it cherry stem? Is it green? It is green shit. It's yeah, it's like an olive. It's green

751
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:07,899
You're thinking of an apple probably. All right. Now we this is the whipped cream whipped cream's gonna

752
01:38:07,899 --> 01:38:14,649
We're gonna make whipped cream nice and glossy though. I'm gonna make it white glossy white

753
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:40,779
Big problem, it's not glossy

754
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:56,380
Does it have to be blue frothy is not well, I don't think I can make it glossy anyways in this one

755
01:38:56,539 --> 01:38:57,979
I think that's good, right?

756
01:38:57,979 --> 01:39:08,520
All right. Now strawberries strawberries are a little darker, aren't they? I need this kind of like there they're kind of like that

757
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,239
Even darker than that

758
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:22,310
Why is that glossy?

759
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:30,420
Oh shit, I could do it. Wait, what's the any of these more strawberry like this one?

760
01:39:30,739 --> 01:40:08,250
Excuse me need like metal. There's so many it probably is like a strawberry texture

761
01:40:12,409 --> 01:40:16,890
I mean, that's I kind of like that one, but that's more like strawberry drizzle. That's not hmm

762
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:27,239
Hmm needs to be a brighter red. Hold on. We got it

763
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:31,109

01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:47,180
You're big. Hmm. I like that though

765
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:54,500
Can't wait to do the marshmallows and some of them by the way gonna be toasted

766
01:40:54,899 --> 01:41:01,819
Some of them are gonna be toasted and then I can't wait to hear the screams in chat about how wrong you were

767
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:20,409
How sad you were that you doubted me that you doubted me for even a second. That's that's pretty good

768
01:41:21,369 --> 01:41:23,369
That's pretty good guys. Just needs to be the right color

769
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:30,390
Strawberries are a little darker

770
01:41:31,239 --> 01:41:49,050
Mmm, not like that though. No and these seeds are gonna be uh, they're black, right strawberry

771
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:54,649
What color is the strawberry? I know, you know, it's the strawberries red

772
01:41:54,649 --> 01:42:00,260
But it's like what some of them can be like kind of green can't they but does that mean that they've rotten?

773
01:42:00,579 --> 01:42:03,409
I've eaten tons of them

774
01:42:03,409 --> 01:42:06,390
Strawberry. Hmm. It's like a deep deep red

775
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:31,300
Here really what that really the same color going on? Um, did I break it? I think I broke it

776
01:42:31,539 --> 01:42:41,319
You're choosing two colors

777
01:42:41,319 --> 01:42:42,039
Oh

778
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:49,079

Hold on. It's even more red. That's less orange more red

781
01:42:59,399 --> 01:43:02,340
Getting there. Maybe one more

01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:19,180
Into here there it is and then this is gonna be black right or white white or black because then these are these are black

783
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:35,800
Well, wait, these could be individual sprinkles. It could be individual sprinkles. Oh shit wrong color. That looks all right

784
01:43:39,579 --> 01:43:41,579
I think a little bit darker. That's too much

785
01:43:46,279 --> 01:43:48,039
moldy

786
01:43:48,039 --> 01:43:51,479
Mold that's strawberries have burning all of them greening black white spots

787
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:59,699
Yeah, they're like a green and black. They're little divots, but then these kind of have to be oh whoops

788
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:09,420
I mean those could be like little chocolate chips or something

789
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:13,579
He's right you psychos. I'm yeah look at get a strawberry

790
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,880
Get really close to it and look at the divots. They're usually like a dark green

791
01:44:23,189 --> 01:44:27,380
Dark green into like really kind of like a black. I don't like the way that looks though

792
01:44:41,819 --> 01:44:45,159
Hmm

793
01:44:45,159 --> 01:44:47,689
I don't hate that

794
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:53,800
This could be a little like chocolate chips or something seeds are yellow

795
01:44:59,270 --> 01:48:26,739
Well, you think about this while I go pee I'll be right back. I gotta play that game by the way

806
01:50:04,659 --> 01:50:09,510
I'll remember you this way in a lot of negative weirdos lately a germa fan you so I drew a positive thing

807
01:50:10,069 --> 01:50:14,789
a lot of negative weirdos

808
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,859
You're eating dog treats those turkey. What did you say? Let's see

809
01:50:21,859 --> 01:50:27,510
But let me see what the negative person said just those turkey sticks are treats for auto

810
01:50:32,899 --> 01:50:36,229
Listen, yeah, I will tell you

811
01:50:37,689 --> 01:50:40,630
Turkey

812
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:47,909
Any beef jerky stick i'm not talking about slim jim's slim jim's are disgusting. I've eaten plenty of them over my lifetime

813
01:50:47,989 --> 01:50:53,510
Okay, they're gross and they stink all

814
01:50:54,050 --> 01:51:00,460
Jerky sticks smell like the inside of a dog treat bag. They do they smell like dog food

815
01:51:00,939 --> 01:51:03,979
I don't know if they taste like dog food because they've never eaten dog food

816
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:09,029
But i'll tell you if they did taste like dog food then dog food tastes pretty good

817
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:16,739
They stink like a dog treat if you take a piece of beef jerky

818
01:51:16,739 --> 01:51:20,579
That's um in the stick form and you hold it up to your nose and you just sniff it for a sec

819
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:23,880
It's it's bad. It smells like

820
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,630
baloney and

821
01:51:26,630 --> 01:51:31,210
And weird sausage meat and just fake kind of flavoring

822
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:36,659
It just smells like a dog treat just gave 70 so 69 community subs. Holy shit

823
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:46,439
Zap x coming in with another 69 subs. Oh my god, that's so much money

824
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:54,739
My brother hold on wait, my brother opened a bag of beef jerky on a plane and the dude in front of us was visibly mad

825
01:52:01,829 --> 01:52:15,529
Oh, I I mean it has a heavy smell. That was quake germa. That was pretty crazy, but thank you zap

826
01:52:15,689 --> 01:52:24,180
That's so much money. That's too much money. We can get back to uh, get back to the snow sticky note drawing of germ

827
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:29,020
Well, that's not a sticky note. That's pretty crazy. Are you coming to my wedding circle? Yes or no?

828
01:52:34,899 --> 01:52:49,140
Yes, awesome stuff as always guys, let's go back to what we were doing very cool strawberry seeds are not yellow

829
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:51,380
Strawberry seeds are black. What are you talking about? Okay

830
01:52:52,649 --> 01:52:57,909
Anyways, I want to go do the the marshmallow ones is gonna be the most fun

831
01:52:59,689 --> 01:53:02,170
Is there you know, you get the white in here. Hold on

832
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:08,939
Let me just do a few marshmallows just so I know what i'm getting into and then like the toasted hold on

833
01:53:10,979 --> 01:53:13,350
Oh, this is gonna be so cool

834
01:53:13,350 --> 01:53:15,350
Oh my god

835
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:34,250
Look at that. Look at it. Just look at it for a second. Let me see more toasted ones

836
01:53:46,390 --> 01:54:00,920
No, it's too toasted way too toasted. That's way too toasted too much. Some of them just be made out of wood

837
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,369
That looks that looks good

838
01:54:08,939 --> 01:54:12,199
Oh

839
01:54:12,199 --> 01:54:29,750
No, it's close, but it's not close enough. All right orange

840
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:38,890
Some of them get like that though

841
01:54:46,859 --> 01:54:48,460
No, not mine

842
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:54,659
What are you talking about? There's many tiers of how to enjoy a roasted marshmallow

843
01:54:55,720 --> 01:55:01,479
There's stick it on the stick and just warm it up a little so it's just the heat is inside of the the

844
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:05,239
Middle and it's a little gooey. It's not toasted at all. It's just warmed

845
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:10,460
That's tier one tier two is you put it on the stick and you rotisserie it

846
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:14,680
Perfectly until the outside edge is like I would say

847
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:19,659
Slightly brown and then it's crunches in your mouth. It pulls back

848
01:55:19,739 --> 01:55:26,039
It's super gooey super warm in the middle and it's viscous in the middle. That's tier two tier three

849
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,779
Is the full on nuclear mode. That's when you let it catch fire

850
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:33,079
You just let the thing burn the whole thing

851
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:40,949
Until it's black blow it out and then you get the you take that skin off. It's like crispy fucking chicken skin

852
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:45,750
But marshmallow and you eat that first and then there's this little center of just

853
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:51,739
Liquid but it's still kind of a solid that's tier three tier four

854
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:55,340
Is you let it light on fire you sit there and you let it burn

855
01:55:55,819 --> 01:55:59,859
It falls off it falls off into the fire and you're like, oh shit

856
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:06,970
And then three or four hours later after the fire goes out you go in there and you find it and it's this little

857
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:13,239
Black speck in there you take your finger you lick your finger you touch this little black speck and then you go

858
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:26,970
It's tier four don't do that though. That's actually horrible. That's really bad for you. Don't do that. Nobody does that

859
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:36,100
I don't do that. It was made it was that was set for comedic purposes only. There you go. Ooh

860
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:50,119
I like that. This looks good. I think this is the one at least some of some of them can be that holy shit

861
01:56:50,279 --> 01:57:11,289
I love it. Mmm, gotta get a little bit of variety. There we go

862
01:57:11,529 --> 01:57:18,579
Oh, and I I will actually scream in your face

863
01:57:19,060 --> 01:57:25,859
If you tell me that the toasted marshmallow the toasted marshmallow jelly belly is not the best one

864
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:38,409
If you say buttered popcorn is leave

865
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:55,779
Now and don't come back. I was just kidding. You can stay okay

866
01:57:57,260 --> 01:58:06,680
Getting i'm kidding. You can stay don't worry. It was a joke. Look at that. It's so toasted and roasted

867
01:58:07,159 --> 01:58:09,159
All right, I gotta settle down relax, dude

868
01:58:09,399 --> 01:58:28,520
This is making me want dessert perma band links, please perma band links. We will probably eventually links are gonna turn into something else

869
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:37,739
Probably these roasted marshmallows with the texture on them, too

870
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:42,729
Oh, please god not my links

871
01:58:43,289 --> 01:58:54,840
Don't worry the cherry. I don't the cherry is okay. Maybe hmm you guys blew it

872
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:01,130
Well, the links are not gonna go away

873
01:59:01,130 --> 01:59:07,220
But I want to find solutions to make them not very spammable and look

874
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:10,260
I've been looking for solutions in quotes for tons of things over the years

875
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:14,979
So I don't know that looks just like the jelly belly jelly bean

876
01:59:16,069 --> 01:59:27,270
Oh, I wish I had a huge plate of those right now. Next is the cake which this has to be

877
01:59:28,539 --> 01:59:47,350
Uh, like a yellow damn it. This is making me so hungry. Yeah, it's got to be like a spongy material

878
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:56,539
And this kind of looks like dinosaur skin spongy

879
02:00:10,359 --> 02:00:14,329
No, this is like wood

880
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:33,100
Maybe

881
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:56,779
This could be ice cream. Wait, this could be ice cream. Couldn't it? It's dipping dots. Hold on

882
02:00:56,859 --> 02:01:10,810
I need to get the right color. Reverse that shit ice cream with fudge sauce

883
02:01:11,210 --> 02:01:32,149
Mmm, that's not a bad idea. Why is it doing that? That could be but that needs to be like a brown

884
02:01:32,390 --> 02:01:49,270
This is making me so hungry

885
02:01:49,510 --> 02:01:57,460
Look at how delicious this looks. This is actually making me really hungry. It's like chocolate and sponge cake marshmallow

886
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:12,920
Oh, jesus. I need ice cream on this though. Oh

887
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:15,020
my

888
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:52,100
Fucking god i'm gonna copy this. Oh my god a little bit more one more

889
02:03:02,630 --> 02:03:45,369
Don't forget don't forget about the color right now. They're not eggs. Forget about the color. Holy shit

890
02:03:45,529 --> 02:04:00,970
Okay, i'm almost done one more in the back a bit higher. There's like a two scoop right here

891
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:20,020
No, no, no, no, no, no, not good enough. There it is. Holy shit. Okay. Wait a little bit lower a little less

892
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:33,430
Okay, wait a little more a little less less. It was like the those you scoop up and just drop it on the sponge cake

893
02:04:33,670 --> 02:04:38,390
Forget about the colors. We're not um, what color what uh ice cream should be, you know?

894
02:04:38,710 --> 02:04:49,539
What color what what kind of ice cream's on it strawberry ice cream? Wait, it should be you're right

895
02:04:49,539 --> 02:04:52,420
It should be strawberry ice cream. Holy shit. This is gonna be awesome

896
02:04:56,840 --> 02:05:05,909
Strawberry ice cream, dude, are you serious? Oh my god. What are you thinking? You're a goddamn genius

897
02:05:06,229 --> 02:05:36,710
No, that's not right. Should there be a pattern mint mint mint? Well, let me get this done. Hmm

898
02:05:37,029 --> 02:05:47,460
Yeah, they need any texture in there smooth strawberry ice cream. That's that light pink color without anything in it

899
02:05:48,149 --> 02:05:51,350
Is my favorite thing on earth. I just want to make sure everyone knows this

900
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:53,579
smooth

901
02:05:53,579 --> 02:06:01,260
Strawberry ice cream barely pink color is the best thing

902
02:06:01,659 --> 02:06:10,649
You that's my favorite thing in the world eating it just straight up is awesome putting it between like having it as like an ice cream sandwich

903
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:12,010
also

904
02:06:12,010 --> 02:06:19,930
As a milkshake smooth strawberry ice cream makes the best milkshake. I will take that over any chocolate milkshake any vanilla shake

905
02:06:22,489 --> 02:06:35,060
Man, it's so good. It's the best it really is paint the sphere. Oh shit this thing in the middle

906
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:46,520
What would that be? That's technically part of the strawberry should be green. This is technically the bottom half of the strawberry

907
02:06:47,000 --> 02:07:01,939
Upside down, right? This would be like cut in half like a pink. We'll get to that in a minute. Oh, it's perfect

908
02:07:21,909 --> 02:07:25,609
Shit okay the wasp nest

909
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:36,649
I'm not sure anything's gonna come closer though because that looks like you've scraped

910
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:46,180
I'm not sure I should go to anything else. I feel like this is the best we're gonna get

911
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:50,979
This looks like it's been scraped and like it's been dropped and

912
02:07:54,619 --> 02:08:00,939
Make the antennas cones. Yeah. Wait, is this something that's better for a cone?

913
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:04,760
Mmm

914
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:21,420
Maybe this let's just test it and then we flip this fucking thing upside down and I flip it around

915
02:08:21,739 --> 02:08:29,479
I can't wait. Wait, come on, but it could be upside down. It could be upside down

916
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:33,270
It could be upside down on top of one of these it could be upside down on top of one of these

917
02:08:33,590 --> 02:08:48,579
All right, keep that out here. No, these are details. I can't do that put pistachio on it. Hold on

918
02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:23,260
Don't tell me I can't do this. I got it. I got this and I tilt it. Let me tilt this shit

919
02:09:24,539 --> 02:09:26,539
I can't tilt it. Why?

920
02:09:28,579 --> 02:09:34,069
No

921
02:09:34,069 --> 02:09:36,949
Use tab tab tab

922
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:40,329
Oh, yes

923
02:09:40,489 --> 02:09:56,789
I almost burped. Oh

924
02:09:56,949 --> 02:10:04,140
Come on

925
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:43,210
No, come on. I'm so close. I'm so close. I wish I could just put it here. Wait, hold on. I can't

926
02:10:47,479 --> 02:11:08,699
Oh kind of hold on kind of kind of it's kind of doing it. Stop it control

927
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:38,899
Oh, you fucked it up. That was it. Oh my goodness. I love it. That's good. That's good there. That's good

928
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:47,829
All right, that's gonna make the cone. Yeah, that's good. Should I put hey check this shit out?

929
02:11:47,989 --> 02:12:29,720
You know what I mean? Like it fell down here and went

930
02:12:31,479 --> 02:12:53,590
One more maybe like right there remember you still have four more things to build you need to hurry up if you want to actually play

931
02:12:53,670 --> 02:13:06,630
What are we talking about? Um, is this too much? I think this might be I don't know

932
02:13:06,789 --> 02:13:12,970
What do you think? It's like it's spilling over the side too much. It might be it's getting a little busy

933
02:13:16,149 --> 02:13:47,000
Hmm. Hold on and then hmm. I need to make the cone different color. This took an hour

934
02:13:48,659 --> 02:13:55,859
Yeah, sure may have to make a spoon over there. Yeah, definitely good idea. That's a really good idea

02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:37,609
Wait, should I reverse it? Yeah, I need to flip these colors. All right, how did I get to that one?

938
02:14:37,689 --> 02:14:40,489
Okay, that one's like a light

939
02:14:40,489 --> 02:14:42,729
No, where did I get that from?

02:16:48,790 --> 02:16:56,489
Hmm, and that needs to be so much a little bit darker, but I can't get it

950
02:16:56,729 --> 02:17:03,350
I don't know where the color is to do that. Maybe no, not that yellow

951
02:17:04,659 --> 02:17:16,469
This brown i'm just gonna leave it. I don't want to mess with it. It's it's it's it's good the way it is

960
02:18:01,639 --> 02:18:07,260
The next three buildings I have to make are going to be cubes all that matters is the ice cream house

961
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:14,440
We've got some good spoon

Don't sell why does it want me to sell this because control can only move it up and down

968
02:20:09,209 --> 02:20:13,540
How do I move it left and right because I can only move it up and down with control

969
02:20:14,459 --> 02:20:21,139
It's shift the other way shift is left and right. It's not what's left and right hold

970
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:26,899
Hold shift hold shift. I can't go left and right. I can only go up and down with both shift and control

971
02:20:27,959 --> 02:20:34,819
Hold alt no up and down tab holding tab makes me just go up and down

972
02:20:35,299 --> 02:20:38,149
Wait, hold on shift

986
02:23:45,159 --> 02:24:00,870
It can be better. Oh, it's so you don't look at it. It's like kind of it's slowly almost falling off the spoon

987
02:24:05,739 --> 02:24:07,500
Whoa, cool. All right

988
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:10,629
We can be better than that though. Mmm

Yep graham cracker doors graham cracker doors and graham cracker windows. That's perfect

993
02:25:30,739 --> 02:25:56,170
We need a good texture for graham cracker though. I mean that's not bad. That's pretty good. Oh, hell yeah

994
02:26:00,659 --> 02:26:04,100
And the middle here though the middle here needs to be

My god, which way should be facing like that. Definitely a little bit higher. I tilt it

1006
02:29:42,010 --> 02:29:51,340
I think i'm gonna tilt it a little just a little bit just to go up a little so it's resting kind of right

1007
02:29:51,340 --> 02:30:02,819
On it and tilt it this way. All right. Looks good. Perfect. Perfect. All right. I gotta gotta get the banana colors

1008
02:30:02,819 --> 02:30:11,719

1009
02:30:11,719 --> 02:30:27,420
They're like a yellow off-white bananas are not yellow. They're like an off-white

02:30:41,450 --> 02:30:43,930
This is a dessert

1013
02:30:43,930 --> 02:30:51,750
This is part of the dessert. The banana is peeled the banana's not sitting there in the banana shell

1014
02:30:52,389 --> 02:30:58,200
It's peeled it's part of the dessert. I just want to make sure i'm very clear about that

1015
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:08,459
I mean that's already perfect. But does it need anything else? I feel like it's a little bear over there

1016
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:14,739
If it's like chocolate speckles on it like it's been

1017
02:31:15,219 --> 02:31:38,309
Splashed in the chocolate. I think so a little darker. There it is

1018
02:31:43,100 --> 02:32:06,629
Um been done for five minutes one. Perfect. It's perfect. It gets been rolling around in the chocolate a little

1019
02:32:07,829 --> 02:32:12,709
It's so don't you want to just take a fork or a spoon and just smush it down on that banana

1020
02:32:13,420 --> 02:32:17,659
Take the piece down here scrape it so the little tip is on the spoon

1021
02:32:18,139 --> 02:32:23,020
Come over here drag it across here on the strawberry and then pick one of these off with your hands

1022
02:32:23,659 --> 02:32:27,719
The other hand take the spoon you had slip right into the cream

1023
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:41,459
Into your mouth bite the banana bite the marshmallow at the same time chocolate on the tip. Oh, I see like it's been dipped in chocolate

1024
02:32:45,610 --> 02:33:13,159

1026
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:37,049

Cigarette save and exit stop. Did you will you go do some push-ups or something burn some energy?

1028
02:33:51,639 --> 02:33:56,760
Yellow seeds yellow seeds yellow seeds for real. I but I don't even know. I don't think I could even fix that

1029
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:58,760
I don't even know what the pattern was

1030
02:34:02,549 --> 02:34:07,180
Can't get over that. This was a banana until five seconds ago

1031
02:34:07,180 --> 02:34:09,500
Now you're making me want to remove it because it's a cigarette

1032
02:34:10,809 --> 02:34:14,010

1038
02:34:51,610 --> 02:35:06,579
Plus that's like mint chocolate chip sprinkles. I think they've been in a little larger. Leave it. It looks good. Yeah

1039
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:09,059

1040
02:35:09,059 --> 02:35:23,059
I'm stepping away

1041
02:35:23,059 --> 02:35:25,559
Wow, it's not even textured

Look at the building cars and cash no ice cream

There and then this guy that gotta have a little bit of detail work. Don't you think let's get the paint job going here?

1077
02:41:39,770 --> 02:41:41,290
All right, so it's

1078
02:41:41,290 --> 02:41:46,790
Let's get the let's get the look here. So it's actually the look is

1079
02:41:47,510 --> 02:41:54,899
It's just like this but just we need that exact texture this exact texture

1080
02:41:58,260 --> 02:42:01,620
Because I just want to regular just cream it just cream. Okay. Oh my god

1081
02:42:01,700 --> 02:42:10,549
It's kind of perfect but not quite I like that middle but I need it to be a little smoother

1082
02:42:13,739 --> 02:42:19,610
close

1083
02:42:19,610 --> 02:42:20,809
Very close

1084
02:42:20,809 --> 02:42:27,209
Let me just get the look first

1085
02:42:27,370 --> 02:42:34,649
I'm gonna go back and do this later. Just give me give me a sec

1086
02:42:36,420 --> 02:42:39,739
Okay

1087
02:42:39,739 --> 02:42:41,420
Ice cream sandwich

1088
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:46,180
I need the money black up top just a straight straight up just black

1089
02:42:46,819 --> 02:42:51,180
What should I do? Let's just I want to see what it looks like. Let's just you know, you idiot

1090
02:42:52,180 --> 02:42:57,459
Idiot, go

1091
02:42:57,459 --> 02:43:01,020
Okay, nice and smooth

1092
02:43:01,020 --> 02:43:02,659
Nice. All right

1093
02:43:02,659 --> 02:43:04,659
Get that black too. Good. Okay

1094
02:43:06,250 --> 02:43:08,329
It needs texture though. It needs texture

1095
02:43:12,790 --> 02:43:15,350
um

1096
02:43:15,350 --> 02:43:19,479
Reverse it that's the way

1097
02:43:19,479 --> 02:43:21,479
I call that perfect if you ask me

1098
02:43:22,790 --> 02:43:26,309
You want to go look at what an ice cream sandwich looks like right now go look at the top

1099
02:43:27,829 --> 02:43:42,100
You tell me if that's not exactly what it looks like looking good. Very good. Oh, that's incredible. Okay

1100
02:43:43,059 --> 02:43:46,260
All right. I need something else to add to this to make it

1101
02:43:46,819 --> 02:43:48,819
Really? You gotta do cookies and cream wheels

1102
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:03,940
That's gotta be

1103
02:44:03,940 --> 02:44:07,739
Let me just get a base here

1104
02:44:07,739 --> 02:44:14,489
Oreos are a lot darker

1105
02:44:14,489 --> 02:44:20,440
Add stats. What are you talking about? You need to add capitalist parts to make it actually functional. What?

1106
02:44:21,079 --> 02:44:28,229
a couple of gumdrops

1107
02:44:28,229 --> 02:44:30,229
Do you put gumdrops on a ice cream sandwich?

1108
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:41,899
But I understand why you would want them on this

1109
02:44:45,129 --> 02:44:47,239
It needs parts

1110
02:44:47,239 --> 02:44:50,180
Um, I have a hold on

1111
02:44:50,260 --> 02:44:52,260
Okay, I got the baseline here. Hold on

1112
02:44:52,500 --> 02:44:56,280
So how we have wheels we have a cockpit see there. It's fine

1113
02:44:56,840 --> 02:45:00,870
All right. Oh, this needs health and shit

1114
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:02,899
oh

1115
02:45:02,899 --> 02:45:05,129
that's

1116
02:45:05,129 --> 02:45:09,110
economic

1117
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:13,159
coins

1118
02:45:13,159 --> 02:45:15,780
effect detail. Oh

1119
02:45:15,940 --> 02:45:17,940
I thought I actually have to do stuff

1120
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:28,260
cockpit, but no whatever

1121
02:45:28,500 --> 02:45:31,020
These could be little gumdrops

1122
02:45:31,020 --> 02:45:39,659
Do chocolate coins?

1123
02:45:39,659 --> 02:45:42,059
Oh, I kind of like the chocolate coin idea

1124
02:45:53,829 --> 02:45:55,430
And they're big too

1125
02:45:55,430 --> 02:46:13,940
Chocolate coins. I want the big one to be visible. There we go. Okay, we got our chocolate coins

1126
02:46:15,879 --> 02:46:23,610
These need to be different. These have to change. This has to be like bright yellow, right? Bright gold. Oh, you can't

1127
02:46:24,010 --> 02:46:32,420
Oh, that's all right

1128
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:41,500
Because we just we can pretend

1129
02:46:42,459 --> 02:46:44,709
Charmed quark

1130
02:46:44,709 --> 02:46:46,709
Eye roller economic power

1131
02:46:47,190 --> 02:46:52,760
This could be one big chocolate coin

1132
02:46:54,389 --> 02:46:57,459
You need to look at the stats

1133
02:46:57,459 --> 02:47:00,739
economic land wheel and deal your way to the top by land

1134
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:02,659
health

1135
02:47:02,659 --> 02:47:04,659
economic power or speed

1136
02:47:05,750 --> 02:47:13,420
Economic power increases trade route profitability survive longer in combat and speed

1137
02:47:14,139 --> 02:47:16,870
This thing's fast

1138
02:47:16,870 --> 02:47:18,870
All right. This is economic. Um

1139
02:47:19,110 --> 02:47:28,579
sandwich car

1140
02:47:28,579 --> 02:47:30,659
All right. I need to the wheels need detail

1141
02:47:32,760 --> 02:47:34,760
the capitalist oreo

1142
02:47:37,379 --> 02:47:42,139
Other way the wheels need a little bit more detail in the middle just like the cookies and cream pattern

1143
02:47:54,620 --> 02:47:56,100
um

1144
02:47:56,100 --> 02:47:57,219
too much

1145
02:47:57,219 --> 02:48:04,180
Other way. Yeah other way

1146
02:48:09,879 --> 02:48:17,459
Um, not dark enough. Oh me actually

1147
02:48:19,579 --> 02:48:25,930
Make a ring pop

1148
02:48:25,930 --> 02:48:27,930
No, no, it's wrong. It's gotta be

1149
02:48:31,639 --> 02:48:34,579
Okay, hold on. Everyone. Just hold on a second

1150
02:48:35,219 --> 02:49:00,780
I think i've got a little bit of an idea here. I don't hate this or it's oreo cereal

1151
02:49:05,639 --> 02:49:08,329
It is good job

1152
02:49:09,430 --> 02:49:20,170
Good don't work. You've got it. It's oreo. Oh, that's right. It needs to be a little darker though

1153
02:49:28,059 --> 02:49:34,299
No lighter. Yeah, that's true oreo is right there

1154
02:49:43,479 --> 02:49:57,129
Need to meet a gear on the bottom ring pop. I'll make a ring pop like airplanes. Hold on

1155
02:49:57,690 --> 02:50:01,319
Add m&m's on it. Hmm

1156
02:50:02,680 --> 02:50:10,549
That looks so cool. I love it

1157
02:50:10,549 --> 02:50:15,159
Holy shit, it's it's it is a ring pop, but this doesn't work on the chocolate though

1158
02:50:15,559 --> 02:50:25,260
It doesn't work on the chocolate weapons dumbass. This is that's not this is a this is not a weapon car

1159
02:50:25,819 --> 02:50:28,379
This is an economic land vehicle

1160
02:50:36,040 --> 02:50:37,879
hmm

1161
02:50:37,879 --> 02:50:42,629
Needs headlights

1162
02:50:42,629 --> 02:50:55,989
Does it you have to have weapons or you'll not win about where the weapons I don't see any weapons effect

1163
02:50:56,389 --> 02:51:08,200
Where do you see weapons? This is it's an economic nation

1164
02:51:09,159 --> 02:51:14,440
I don't have any weapons. All right. I like this the way it is

1165
02:51:15,079 --> 02:51:24,469
I like the oreo owes wheels ice cream sandwich and then the chocolate coins for the economics car make gumdrop headlights

1166
02:51:24,950 --> 02:51:54,700
Oh, but that's a great idea. I think I have to do that x yeah, there's nothing here night light

1167
02:51:59,799 --> 02:52:22,649
Gumdrop. Hmm. What should they be right here gumdrops or no

1168
02:52:23,370 --> 02:52:45,530
Milk duds. I gotta stick with the theme gotta stay with the theme guys. Can't just

1169
02:52:51,030 --> 02:53:01,670
Hmm, but they're lights. It's gonna be hard to do chocolate lights

1170
02:53:03,030 --> 02:53:17,959
Brown light you're gonna want more economic put the economic stuff underneath. Um, am I really though?

1171
02:53:23,270 --> 02:53:31,579
There we go rock candy lights just clip it into the car

02:53:32,059 --> 02:53:59,430
Hmm. Those are what just like stuff this in here somewhere just clip this into the car. Um

1174
02:54:14,229 --> 02:54:46,360
What it has rims now, but that messes with what the oreo owes underneath now

1175
02:54:46,360 --> 02:55:04,389
That's kind of hidden between the headlights. No, I don't I want to be hidden. I don't even like the headlights

1176
02:55:04,709 --> 02:55:17,850
I don't like them. I don't want them. I wanted to be simple hide the coins. I like the chocolate coins

1177
02:55:18,329 --> 02:55:22,379

Hold on

1179
02:55:40,469 --> 02:55:46,340
But it doesn't go with the chocolate theme. There's a theme. There's a theme

1180
02:55:57,260 --> 02:56:13,780
What about the theme? Why can I not pick these up? It's annoying. I can't clip it into there

1181
02:56:13,940 --> 02:56:37,059
The theme we want brake lights there ring pop brake lights sing the raid song

1182
02:56:37,299 --> 02:56:46,819
What fuck the lights keep the theme? I think it matches a little it does match

1183
02:56:47,059 --> 02:56:53,459
We don't know who raided what you talking about put the headlights back now. All right fine

1184
02:56:53,540 --> 02:57:02,379
I'll get the headlights back because we're going away from the theme which one it was it was these ones, right?

02:58:18,389 --> 02:58:32,469
Holy shit

1191
02:58:32,469 --> 02:58:34,549
No, it messes with the theme

1192
02:58:34,549 --> 02:58:55,399
But the theme I don't want it. This thing's just gonna get the shit kicked out of it. Um, it's because your cockpit sucks

1193
02:58:56,360 --> 02:59:05,110
What if I just put another no hide stuff under it? It's all percentages. Oh, okay

1194
02:59:05,190 --> 02:59:18,219
So it's a 60 economic powerhouse. All right, i'm that's good. That's good. I'm done there economic oreo

02:59:34,840 --> 02:59:53,059
the red white and blue

1197
02:59:53,299 --> 03:00:04,629
Um, we did it the age of technology and transportation has arrived your city is the first to appear on the planet

1198
03:00:05,370 --> 03:00:11,610
But your species no longer speaks with a single voice soon. Other cities will arise built by factions of your own species

1199
03:00:12,260 --> 03:00:20,729
You must unify to advance welcome to civilization. You now control the vehicles and the city planning for your nation

1200
03:00:21,290 --> 03:00:23,030
Starting with its first city

1201
03:00:23,030 --> 03:00:28,600
You must interact with other nations when they appear to begin your quest for global domination. Let's take a look at the bar

1202
03:00:30,629 --> 03:00:36,709
Each city you conquer convert or purchase will help you progress towards the goal to control the entire planet

1203
03:00:37,940 --> 03:00:38,979
Okay

1204
03:00:38,979 --> 03:00:42,819
Your nation begins with a single specialty, but you can add more by conquering other cities

1205
03:00:43,379 --> 03:00:48,329
My specialty is I don't know move the camera freely around the world

1206
03:00:48,329 --> 03:00:51,930
This helps you to check in on cities or vehicles to whom you have given orders

1207
03:00:52,170 --> 03:00:56,100
All right, let's pause for a moment and learn the basic camera controls and how to select a vehicle

1208
03:00:56,979 --> 03:01:00,260
Hold left and right mouse buttons at the same time to pinch and rotate the camera

1209
03:01:01,059 --> 03:01:02,860

1215
03:01:24,840 --> 03:01:28,920
Look for a nearby spice geyser like this one then click on it to send your vehicle to claim it

1216
03:01:29,399 --> 03:01:36,709
Spices become a valued commodity mining. It will help you fill the coffers of your nations. Okay, so you have to go to spice geysers

1217
03:01:42,040 --> 03:01:46,920
Okay, your nation's goals will appear here your first goal is to claim a spice geyser and begin mining operations

1218
03:01:47,989 --> 03:01:50,469
Controlling spice geysers will increase your nation's production

1219
03:01:52,069 --> 03:02:01,500
All right. Well, let's save it

1220
03:02:01,500 --> 03:02:02,379
Okay

1221
03:02:02,379 --> 03:02:11,899

1235
03:04:35,059 --> 03:04:57,379

03:16:23,530 --> 03:16:38,280
I don't get it. He's gonna hold it get us back. It'll be on the chest. How is this supposed to sit on there?

1293
03:16:38,360 --> 03:16:55,579
Let's fold the other way one. Please tilt it. There we go. Okay, now pull it forward

1294
03:17:09,340 --> 03:17:12,889
This is the best I can do like this. I can't make it very much better than that

1295
03:17:18,440 --> 03:17:35,770
I'm desperately trying to put this here. It just doesn't want to go back

1296
03:17:36,010 --> 03:18:07,559
Okay, and then hold shift see like what the hell just put it on his arms. That's better. I don't care

I mean cock boy this I need to change this his mustache has got like flaming hot cheeto dust all over

1299
03:18:48,090 --> 03:18:50,200
Does that happen?

1300
03:18:50,200 --> 03:18:53,559
Okay, if you have a huge mustache and you eat a ton of flaming hot cheetos

1301
03:18:54,700 --> 03:19:03,700
Will it do that? Do you have to go wash your face your beard hair afterwards all the time all the time?

1302
03:19:05,479 --> 03:19:10,360
I feel like if you ate flaming hot cheetos a lot with a big beard and especially big mustache

1303
03:19:11,850 --> 03:19:17,829
And you didn't clean it out completely and you sneezed later. Could you sneeze flaming hot cheeto powder into your eyes?

1304
03:19:23,340 --> 03:19:35,209
Yes, you could the actual hazard that never happens to me. You could accidentally inhale it too. Oh, oh, oh

1305
03:19:35,770 --> 03:19:37,079
Yeah

1306
03:19:37,079 --> 03:19:51,139
Yeah, you could we go right in your nose. You would just smell it forever. Oh

1307
03:19:53,340 --> 03:19:57,799
Okay, this is part two to this conversation. How many of you guys like pizza?

1308
03:19:59,659 --> 03:20:01,020
Yeah, see I know yeah, settle down

1309
03:20:01,020 --> 03:20:04,420
I just asked you to raise your hand those of you that eat pizza all the time

1310
03:20:04,659 --> 03:20:11,579
You ever have a greasy pizza and after you have like pepperoni and there's like it's greasy slice and like an hour later

1311
03:20:12,219 --> 03:20:16,379
You just smell oil you smell pizza grease

1312
03:20:16,860 --> 03:20:20,379
It's all must be somewhere like on your lip or on your chin somewhere

1313
03:20:20,459 --> 03:20:25,530
Even if you've wiped it off, even if you've cleaned it that smell of pizza grease stays with you

1314
03:20:26,469 --> 03:20:30,940
so follow up to that last thing those of you beard guys

1315
03:20:31,930 --> 03:20:38,149
And mustache guys that eat greasy pizza is that times a thousand?

1316
03:20:43,959 --> 03:20:52,139
Yes, it's horrible because I wash my face. No, even if you wash your face it stays there. Yes. It's awful. It's awful

1317
03:20:52,139 --> 03:21:00,950
It's awful. That's pretty divided on this. Hmm. Just wash your hands and wash your beard. Something's wrong with you

1318
03:21:01,030 --> 03:21:07,940
No, it's not a kind of radioactive pizza. No, you just you don't get it. Those either get it get it

1319
03:21:10,629 --> 03:21:22,139
This really does kind of look like an old like ice cream man. All right, i'm keeping it. We're children

1320
03:21:22,809 --> 03:21:29,049
Oh, you're not I gotta pee again. Can I go pee again and get a water?

1323
03:24:28,840 --> 03:24:29,819

03:24:29,819 --> 03:24:36,409
Uh, let's play the game now one more. Uh-oh

1325
03:24:39,500 --> 03:24:44,299
So what do you guys think is gonna happen when I inevitably do the cat boy streams?

1326
03:24:45,260 --> 03:24:53,850
Are we gonna get times two as many cat boy artwork or will we hit the apex of the meme and will we go down?

1327
03:24:54,920 --> 03:25:01,860
What do you think i'm not sure it's gonna increase

1328
03:25:05,049 --> 03:25:07,129
You'll get cursed and you'll never be able to take it off

1329
03:25:14,149 --> 03:25:15,750
What a dumb curse

1330
03:25:15,750 --> 03:25:26,219
Like honestly, if that's the worst curse you could you could give me what oh, okay

1331

Your skin will start to melt off over the course of five years until you're nothing but bones

1333
03:25:38,020 --> 03:25:42,520
Everything you eat will taste like dirty shit for the rest of your life

1334
03:25:44,309 --> 03:25:46,309
You'll have cat ears and

1335
03:25:47,350 --> 03:25:49,350
A tube top on forever

Okay, what I don't care, but you don't understand it'll be you have ears

03:25:55,540 --> 03:25:57,780
I don't care. Like what is it? Does this hurt me?

03:25:58,600 --> 03:26:04,040
No, in fact way more people are gonna be interested in your stream

04:27:29,440 --> 04:27:35,899
Hey, no, don't put whatever we demand money. I don't have any money. I don't have anything left

1689
04:27:36,340 --> 04:27:44,329
What are the cheat codes? Just give me a ten million dollars. I don't get this this part like him sucks

1690
04:27:44,329 --> 04:28:04,100
I can't build anything. Most people love this part. No, they do not

1691
04:28:06,739 --> 04:28:10,969
Kill it kill this thing

1692
04:28:12,159 --> 04:28:13,639
Destroy it, please

1693
04:28:13,639 --> 04:28:25,040
Come on epic cantaloupe. Please destroy the city

1694
04:28:25,700 --> 04:28:34,840
Whose is this? You know what? I think the problem is here

1695
04:28:35,360 --> 04:28:39,500
This is from too many friends over your house. That's what the problem is with this

1696
04:28:39,500 --> 04:28:41,059
And this is the problem I had since the very beginning

1697
04:28:41,059 --> 04:28:46,520
They were one two three four five that what six seven people on the map on a map this small

1698
04:28:46,860 --> 04:28:48,860
Too many fucking people over your house to play risk

1699
04:28:48,979 --> 04:28:55,780
You can't play risk with six or seven people like that's too many people you play it with like three or four people four people

1700
04:28:56,420 --> 04:29:19,819
Not six. That's too many friends over your house. It's too spread out to be fair

1701
04:29:19,819 --> 04:29:29,049
The game is very hard while playing when you go in blind. I mean I I don't care

1702
04:29:29,829 --> 04:29:34,649
Do something I'm so overwhelmed. I don't even know where to start. It's like too many things have happened

1703
04:29:34,649 --> 04:29:38,040
I try to make like okay

1704
04:29:38,040 --> 04:29:43,959
I tried to make a trade route with two different cities and then like the world collapsed. What the fuck?

1705
04:29:44,280 --> 04:29:48,950
It was like I'd like to have a trade route

1706
04:29:49,430 --> 04:30:04,180
Yeah, everyone's dead your world is exploding make more factories. I don't even know what the factories do. Oh

1707
04:30:06,459 --> 04:30:27,829
Remember you made that monster. Well, why is it here?

1708
04:30:29,180 --> 04:30:31,459
Why is it just sitting outside their gates?

1709
04:30:32,100 --> 04:30:46,610
Is it asleep?

1710
04:30:47,209 --> 04:30:49,209
At war

1711
04:30:49,690 --> 04:30:52,530
My god, holy shit, can I take this?

1712
04:30:53,129 --> 04:31:04,319
This is ready to take this is what you fucking deserve you deserve you deserve this shit

1713
04:31:04,840 --> 04:31:21,760
Oh my goodness. What is happening now? I have do I have is this mine? This is mine. Okay, I need a

1714
04:31:25,360 --> 04:31:31,979

1715
04:31:32,739 --> 04:31:35,100
Yellow nation is captured. The red nation is gone. Oh

1716
04:31:36,620 --> 04:31:46,850
How do I skip to the other stage take Haven back? I can't I feel like restart

1717
04:31:47,090 --> 04:31:59,149
Look at how much shit I'm surrounded by you don't have to restart. I don't

1718
04:31:59,709 --> 04:32:08,520
Control shift see more money bribe orange. Oh sift see bribe orange

We come offering gifts of house four thousand more dollars

1722
04:32:49,459 --> 04:33:36,139
What the fuck will you like me yet? You are no longer at war with the orange nation. Nice

1723
04:33:36,459 --> 04:33:47,159
All right. Now I'm gonna buy all the cities with all the fake money that I have

1724
04:33:48,880 --> 04:33:53,279
I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care

1725
04:33:53,279 --> 04:33:57,680
I don't even care. I don't care. Ask me. Ask me if I care. Do I care? I don't care

1726
04:33:58,200 --> 04:34:18,180
Good, ask me. This thing is still attacking their city and then I'm gonna buy these motherfuckers

1727
04:34:18,700 --> 04:34:23,740
Worst gamer moment. I don't know that's day. I don't care. I know I don't care at all

1728
04:34:23,740 --> 04:34:36,200
I don't like this part this part stinks to me. I'm gonna buy orange and then

1729
04:34:45,979 --> 04:34:47,979
explain in detail of why I

1730
04:34:49,069 --> 04:34:53,569
Willing to bet that if there's 12,000 people here right now, it's just under 12,000

1731
04:34:53,709 --> 04:34:56,110
Those who that played this game before you probably don't remember

1732
04:34:57,110 --> 04:35:01,700
You getting to this part in the game and going I don't I'm just want to skip this

1733
04:35:02,180 --> 04:35:06,229
And then just giving yourself $50,000 is going to the space stage

1734
04:35:06,869 --> 04:35:12,220
Yeah, I think a lot of you just don't remember. They don't want to trade with me

1735
04:35:12,680 --> 04:35:32,700
We admire you and we want to give you free money. You like me yet your people our people admire you

1736
04:35:32,740 --> 04:35:45,520
We have more gifts for you. Would you like to be our friend and trade with us? Don't please don't oh my fucking god

1737
04:35:45,520 --> 04:35:46,900
Damn it, dude

1738
04:35:46,900 --> 04:36:04,419
This thing's got to go. How do I declare you're a threat to us your nation's too big?

1739
04:36:04,419 --> 04:36:16,380
Well, can I buy you we set up a trade route with the other guy?

1740
04:36:17,060 --> 04:36:26,020
Blue listen to me trade route. Hope you lose cheating

1741
04:36:26,500 --> 04:36:31,069
What is going on over here?

1742
04:36:31,069 --> 04:36:39,310
Middle is hard. This middle road is the hardest for this stage. Wait, did I get bad RNG and got in the worst spot?

1743
04:36:39,349 --> 04:36:54,259
That's an excuse

1744
04:36:54,700 --> 04:36:57,520
Here's me. Would you like to trade?

1745
04:36:58,580 --> 04:36:59,700
great

1746
04:36:59,700 --> 04:37:09,060
Trade with the city and by the way, I will handsomely pay for your city and your capital

1747
04:37:09,659 --> 04:37:19,130
Is it gone?

1748
04:37:19,130 --> 04:37:24,330
Economic is the easiest. Yeah, but you guys I think you guys are misunderstanding that like I've never played this before

1749
04:37:25,209 --> 04:37:29,819
Yeah, when you were like 15, you probably came home from school every day. You probably played this a thousand times

1750
04:37:29,819 --> 04:37:32,580
This is the first time I've ever seen this. I went to the creature stage

1751
04:37:32,580 --> 04:37:36,119
I've made the guys like elongated his tail and made a big head and then I never played the game ever again

1752
04:37:36,740 --> 04:38:06,169
Cheat more. Oh god. Damn it. The orange took this but what is this? What's this?

1753
04:38:06,810 --> 04:38:12,220
You're at war with orange. How do I declare I get stop declaring war?

1754
04:38:13,040 --> 04:38:16,939
What's the cheat to like drop a bomb?

1755
04:38:17,599 --> 04:38:23,430
Give me the bomb cheat. I want it

1756
04:38:23,470 --> 04:38:33,029
Unlock super weapons. Thank you. Oh, this is

1757
04:38:34,970 --> 04:38:38,650
I don't get off the steam overlay

1758
04:38:43,590 --> 04:38:57,009
Nine hours, holy shit nine full hours. Has it been that long?

1759
04:38:57,729 --> 04:39:04,580
global merger

1760
04:39:04,580 --> 04:39:32,779
happened whoa, I

1761
04:39:32,779 --> 04:39:41,169
Guarantee you half of you guys got to the stage and knew that existed and just pressed it and by the way

1762
04:39:41,569 --> 04:39:51,099
What yeah what kind of that's just for people to skip like here to launch your space

1763
04:39:51,419 --> 04:40:00,259
Exploration program if we sent it to the creator to create a ship for your maiden voyage modification can be made later. Nice

1764
04:40:00,860 --> 04:40:16,950
Mental gymnastics Andy the choices are your evolutionary history of go. It's just a straight line. I didn't do anything

1765
04:40:17,189 --> 04:40:25,220
That's an endgame thing your traits affect not only your inherent abilities

1766
04:40:25,220 --> 04:40:34,509
Okay, I beat this in multiple times as a baby without you weren't a baby. You were like at least 12

1767
04:40:36,610 --> 04:40:39,770
Creators are in it for the profit. Their only allegiance is to the almighty spore buck

1768
04:40:42,639 --> 04:40:50,139
Instantly makes trading systems available for pretty cool. All right, I legit beat this when I was 14

1769
04:40:50,139 --> 04:40:53,259
Yeah, you know how developed your brain is when you're 14. That's fine

1770
04:40:53,500 --> 04:40:56,159
You probably played this you probably played this every day

1771
04:40:56,759 --> 04:41:02,380
look if me and a 14 year old were in a knitting contest and

1772
04:41:02,659 --> 04:41:08,299
That 14 year old knitted every day and it was super into knitting and they did it every day after school

1773
04:41:08,299 --> 04:41:12,180
They could get any they were really really into it. They're gonna beat me in a knitting contest

1774
04:41:12,619 --> 04:41:22,810
You could take a 10 year old that can juggle right the juggle every day and you put me in

1775
04:41:22,810 --> 04:41:27,330
Okay, you're in a juggling contest with that 11 year old. That's an 11 year old. You'll be I don't I don't know anything about juggling

1776
04:41:27,330 --> 04:41:29,450
You're gonna beat me 11 year old. You're good at juggling

1777
04:41:29,490 --> 04:41:42,860
I have not learned any juggling video video games are your career

1778
04:41:43,380 --> 04:41:47,659
Not this one. I

1779
04:41:48,220 --> 04:41:50,700
What do you what does that even mean?

1780
04:41:51,259 --> 04:41:54,819
That doesn't matter all games are different

1781
04:41:55,979 --> 04:41:59,060
Every game is different from another what that are you really?

1782
04:41:59,540 --> 04:42:09,860
This game is wildly different than the last game that we played on this channel

1783
04:42:10,099 --> 04:42:15,020
Wait, I'm supposed to know how to play every single video game that's ever ever released

1784
04:42:15,540 --> 04:42:28,340
Europe I'm a professional

1785
04:42:28,979 --> 04:42:41,939
Bore-streamer, this is the exact same game resume. You should be banned from every game. This is a kid's game

1786
04:42:41,939 --> 04:42:46,459
It doesn't matter out of a kid's game or not. It's the this isn't even a kid's game

1787
04:42:47,099 --> 04:42:51,060
Will Wheaton when he made this when he like got on stage

1788
04:42:51,060 --> 04:42:55,020
He was like this is gonna be the fucking most revolutionary game for everybody to play and everyone was like, holy shit

1789
04:42:55,020 --> 04:43:09,790
This is awesome. Whatever his name is not what's his name?

1790
04:43:09,790 --> 04:43:11,790
Not

1791
04:43:12,430 --> 04:43:20,380
Will Wright, yes, there it is. Thank you. Will Wright didn't get on stage into the going to the microphone

1792
04:43:21,380 --> 04:43:23,759
I'm gonna introduce my latest kids game

1793
04:43:24,299 --> 04:43:27,549
This one is for children. It's called sport. It's for kids

1794
04:43:27,709 --> 04:43:37,720
It's like gonzo didn't get on stage after that by the gonzo is not for kids either gonzo sick

1795
04:43:37,720 --> 04:43:41,810
I love that if that makes me a little kid. I don't care. I fucking love gonzo

1796
04:43:56,669 --> 04:43:59,360
Anyways to complete that statement

1797
04:43:59,520 --> 04:44:05,369
McDonald's is better than Wendy's more than half the time. I like eating there more than I like eating at Wendy's. I

1798
04:44:20,509 --> 04:44:22,509
Can't believe you cheated

1799
04:44:24,900 --> 04:44:39,669
You guys have fun I like having fun with you guys whoo, I like that bully button

1800
04:44:44,869 --> 04:45:00,099
Videogames are your career

1801
04:45:00,700 --> 04:45:09,860
Unprofessional gamer. Hey, you know somebody could tell you I

1802
04:45:11,020 --> 04:45:14,659
Streaming it's my career not video games

1803
04:45:15,180 --> 04:45:22,950
The video game really matter a lot of the time think about that. Hold on a second. Think about that. It's a good question

1804
04:45:23,150 --> 04:45:36,840
I'm an e-clown. I'm not a video game. I'm not a professional video game streamer. I'm a goddamn e-clown

1805
04:45:36,959 --> 04:46:17,139
Get it, right. You cheated not only game, but yourself. Yeah, I did and I would do it again, too

1806
04:46:17,139 --> 04:46:21,509
I would do it again. I would do it again right now. I would press ctrl shift Z

1807
04:46:22,150 --> 04:46:24,430
ctrl sip shift C and type in

1808
04:46:25,470 --> 04:46:40,950
Dominate galaxy and win. I want to make this a rock-a-pop. I don't think I can though. I kind of like this little guy

1809
04:46:41,509 --> 04:46:50,229
Okay, but the spaceship looks sick Jeremy

1810
04:46:55,360 --> 04:47:01,110
It's worth hacking in space because it's really really hard to get money

1811
04:47:01,630 --> 04:47:08,020
Well, I mean, I'm probably only gonna just drive around and just look at stuff

1812
04:47:08,340 --> 04:47:19,630
The space days sucks to be honest. This part sucks. This part is bad. I'm gonna be really mad at this

1813
04:47:19,990 --> 04:47:26,180
I'm a duster. Ooh

1814
04:47:26,459 --> 04:47:42,090
Ooh, I like that. It's cool. If you play with the tools, okay goes to 11. Hmm sausage phone. I

1815
04:47:45,970 --> 04:48:08,650
Want some no, it's very bright. Should I be that bright? I feel like that's not a good idea

1816
04:48:08,790 --> 04:48:32,729
Well people just be able to see me. Okay, and wait, there's oars. Why would I need this on a spaceship? Sonic reducer? Oh

1817
04:48:34,529 --> 04:49:00,680
Oh cool. All right. That's so cool. Oh cool. There you go

1818
04:49:07,779 --> 04:49:16,950
Well, I like it finding earth is the end game. Did you spoil spore for me?

1819
04:49:17,029 --> 04:49:22,400
Wait till fucking will

1820
04:49:22,560 --> 04:49:31,259
Wait, not will we why did I say will Wheaton? Okay. Now I need

1821
04:49:37,029 --> 04:50:11,240
Frusters. Ooh, it's good last wings. Ooh, these are cool, too. No, I like the simplicity of this

1822
04:50:11,400 --> 04:50:46,540
Well dog shit. Oh, he said dog coin. Oh, whatever. Oh, I like I like the McDonald's one, too

1823
04:50:49,520 --> 04:51:11,919
Mmm, which maybe I'll just do a pre-made keep it white. Ooh, that's cool. This is Rockwell's modern life

1824
04:51:11,919 --> 04:51:27,720
I want this I think I'm ready. I might want to add a little bit one or more detail here a

1825
04:51:31,540 --> 04:52:05,700
Ventilation to add gills, but I like it. It's a turtle ship. It's pretty cool. I like it. All right, you ready Rick and Morty

1826
04:52:07,340 --> 04:52:40,720
It's so easy to visit make so many people that

1827
04:52:41,299 --> 04:52:42,909
You know

1828
04:52:42,909 --> 04:52:45,790
I was actually thinking I was gonna buy a Rick and Morty t-shirt

1829
04:52:46,029 --> 04:52:50,159
And I was gonna just turn on the cam and not say anything about it and just it was a shirt

1830
04:52:50,159 --> 04:52:53,159
I had on just watch you guys freak the fuck out

1831
04:52:53,919 --> 04:53:02,819
Lift off you've successfully developed a ship capable of spaceflight

1832

The heavens beckon in the cosmos awaits the universe is at your fingertips if you can learn to fly this thing me

1833
04:53:16,630 --> 04:53:18,549
Captain German at 8 5

1834
04:53:18,549 --> 04:53:23,159
Welcome to the pinnacle of existence the final frontier the wildest wildest West space

1835
04:53:23,680 --> 04:53:29,580
You control the ship and from this vintage lead your race from planet beyond civilization to a vast galactic Empire

1836
04:53:29,919 --> 04:53:31,599
Let's look at how you progress

1837
04:53:31,599 --> 04:53:36,119
This bar tracks your progress towards badges you earn as well as your proximity to the center of the galaxy

1838
04:53:36,720 --> 04:53:42,110
Mish and God nobody heard that mission control on the planet surface is anxious to speak to you

1839
04:53:42,110 --> 04:53:48,209
Let's learn how to communicate this short-range video communicator is your contact to those in the world below

1840
04:53:48,650 --> 04:53:55,669
You must be in the planet's orbit to open the line. Okay, the flashing signal means you haven't I didn't fart

1841
04:53:55,669 --> 04:53:58,389
I just burped really loud under my breath and leaned back

1842
04:53:58,389 --> 04:54:04,479
So the limiter didn't pick it up is an incoming transmission if it's blinking. Okay, so it's blinking

1843
04:54:06,580 --> 04:54:09,419
Congratulations cadet. You've got a fine ride there

1844
04:54:09,700 --> 04:54:13,700
We're still adding new equipment to your ship, but we should have it ready for space travel in no time

1845
04:54:14,099 --> 04:54:21,349
Have you flown a spaceship before no, well, nothing like a test flight while the entire population of the germa might of planet

1846
04:54:21,349 --> 04:54:25,110
Zircon looks on what do you say ready to earn your captain's badge?

1847
04:54:25,669 --> 04:54:30,439
Yeah, each city on planet Zircon

1848
04:54:30,959 --> 04:54:35,360
Has launched a giant orb in celebration of our first spaceship really you can't miss them

1849
04:54:35,720 --> 04:54:40,919
Take your ship on a spin around the planet to seven of our cities fly through the orbs to break them

1850
04:54:41,119 --> 04:54:46,000
Okay, your immediate mission goals are tracked here in the mini mission log

1851
04:54:46,400 --> 04:54:52,099
You can track up to three missions in mini form from the full mission log by hitting the L key

1852
04:54:52,099 --> 04:54:55,860
Okay, I through the orbs the right mouse button use the arrow keys to fly

1853
04:54:56,380 --> 04:55:28,310
See if you can crash fly through the orbs or more

1854
04:55:35,110 --> 04:55:44,310
64 it kind of is fresh joke

1855
04:55:45,150 --> 04:55:48,220
Come on

1856
04:55:49,139 --> 04:55:55,610
Job cadet worth flying like that. You'll make captain in no time now that you're an ace at flying

1857
04:55:55,610 --> 04:56:01,909
We're ready for you to use some of the sophisticated tools. Just whatever it will happen. It won't happen

1858
04:56:02,189 --> 04:56:05,990
We've been working on the ability to scan the planets and animals you discover on your travels

1859
04:56:06,150 --> 04:56:08,520
Looks like this tool comes just in the nick of time

1860
04:56:08,959 --> 04:56:14,840
The sporepedia record of one of our own animals recently became corrupted at the same time the animals started exhibiting some odd symptoms

1861
04:56:14,919 --> 04:56:20,290
We need you to scan the animal so we can collect more information about the species

1862
04:56:20,689 --> 04:56:26,750
The creature in question is exhibiting a glowing tail an odd glowing trail

1863
04:56:26,990 --> 04:56:29,790
Just wipe that part out and rewrite over it

1864
04:56:29,909 --> 04:56:34,029
Your ship has been equipped with a radar tool that can be turned off and on in the main tools panel

1865
04:56:34,069 --> 04:56:38,310
It will point to emission targets and items of interest when on a planet surface

1866
04:56:38,509 --> 04:56:43,360
The radar beeps faster when you're closer to your target. I'm laughing

1867
04:56:43,360 --> 04:56:54,799
I keep glancing at what you guys are writing. It's like the scan tool. Oh my god

1868
04:56:54,799 --> 04:56:58,659
There's a lot of tools your tools panel is sorted by type

1869
04:56:58,819 --> 04:57:03,279
Your scan tools found in the main tools panel look up your scan tool by clicking on it or just press 2

1870
04:57:03,439 --> 04:57:20,000
Okay, scan to enter the information targeted so we have to find somebody remember when I was down there and I was one of these

1871
04:57:20,479 --> 04:57:33,520
Get them pick them up

1872
04:57:33,680 --> 04:57:48,680
Let's get doing

1873
04:57:48,680 --> 04:57:50,680
Execute him. What am I supposed to do?

1874
04:57:51,279 --> 04:57:57,680
Scan him. I'm

1875
04:57:57,720 --> 04:58:20,680
Trying to left click on him. Oh, well, it's always right click. What do you want to do next? Okay, quite valuable

1876
04:58:20,840 --> 04:58:25,479
It is now third or so. We need to examine the species more closely ship is equipped with an abduction beam

1877
04:58:26,080 --> 04:58:28,139
abduct a species

1878
04:58:28,139 --> 04:58:33,110
Use the abduction beam found in the cargo panel to collect this creature for further research

1879
04:58:33,669 --> 04:58:37,349
Make sure you deploy the tool long enough until the creature is fully secured in the ship's cargo bay

1880
04:58:37,790 --> 04:58:43,770
Stopping too soon before your cargo is secured may result in less than desirable circumstances for the victim. Oh, I mean the specimen

1881
04:58:44,150 --> 04:59:14,959
Okay, we're getting drunk. Let's go get him. Okay this one here. All right, let's get him

1882
04:59:15,360 --> 04:59:19,240
Your active tool is shown in your spaceport your ship portrait

1883
04:59:20,580 --> 04:59:40,119
deactivated tool press escape I kill him what I clicked on him I

1884
04:59:42,400 --> 04:59:44,400
abducted a diseased animal

1885
04:59:55,000 --> 04:59:57,000
abduct a ball-luing animal

1886
04:59:57,479 --> 05:00:06,479
Drop off the ball-luing within the city walls

1887
05:00:23,360 --> 05:00:28,240
Measurably fine work cadet. You've provided us with excellent specimen to research probe twice abduct once

1888
05:00:28,240 --> 05:00:36,720
I always say now what it appears the specimen you collected was sick and is infested with a virus that is capable of spreading at

1889
05:00:36,720 --> 05:00:47,119
An alarming rate it could endanger our entire ecosystem. Okay, take out the infected creatures while while avoiding the healthy ones

1890
05:00:47,779 --> 05:00:51,110
Look at how many tabs there are down there

1891
05:00:51,310 --> 05:00:58,240
Be careful you point that laser. It's capable of destroying buildings vehicles and other spaceships. Oh dear

1892
05:00:58,799 --> 05:01:11,400
Okay, I have the laser equipped and be careful only kill the ones that are here

1893
05:01:12,040 --> 05:01:19,590
Damn, okay

1894
05:01:19,590 --> 05:01:32,549
More over here

1895
05:01:32,549 --> 05:01:37,270
Don't fire at me. What are you doing? I'm in the air over here

1896
05:01:37,950 --> 05:01:42,700
Well

1897
05:01:42,700 --> 05:01:44,740
You

1898
05:01:44,740 --> 05:02:12,880
You want to kill this guy? I mean that wanted me to kill him remove one more diseased animal

1899
05:02:12,880 --> 05:02:30,490
Why is it making me go this way?

1900
05:02:30,490 --> 05:02:50,560
Where they're diseased? Yeah, I know but where's this last one over here kill everyone from the city?

1901
05:02:51,669 --> 05:02:57,099
Psycho, that's kind of weird. It was pointing at that other guy

1902
05:02:57,740 --> 05:03:08,159
Okay, that's that I need to go BRB one more time because Otto wants to go outside. He just went hey

1903
05:03:08,159 --> 05:10:08,419
He doesn't yell to me. I'll be right back final BRB of the night. I would assume you're back. I have returned

1904
05:10:10,909 --> 05:10:22,569
I got some chocolate while Otto took a poop. I'm just sitting there watching him

1905
05:10:23,090 --> 05:10:32,880
Out there just eating chocolate while he's shitting and I don't know it was I didn't mean for that to happen, but it did

1906
05:10:42,229 --> 05:10:46,040
Somebody just writes thanks for sharing

1907
05:10:48,259 --> 05:10:59,479
Yeah, that story did not need to be told like I didn't need to tell you that

1908
05:11:00,000 --> 05:11:11,759
No, none of you needed to know that happened. I don't know why I decided to tell you there was no relevance to do to explain that

1909
05:11:12,200 --> 05:11:23,360
Anyways, let's continue. What we're doing. We were examining creatures

1910
05:11:25,630 --> 05:11:27,630
Laudable job. You're on the right stuff

1911
05:11:27,790 --> 05:11:30,069
You've earned your homeworld's respect and confidence

1912
05:11:30,349 --> 05:11:35,069
We want you to pile this spaceship and lead our race forward into galactic explanation and glory. It's getting stuck

1913
05:11:35,310 --> 05:11:40,560
You've earned the badge and title of captain. It's coconut. That's why I thought it was weird

1914
05:11:40,560 --> 05:11:44,689
I always feel like I'm eating fucking like shaved wood

1915
05:11:45,569 --> 05:11:50,450
Chips our scientists have developed an interplanetary drive for your ship, but you'll need to install it first

1916
05:11:50,930 --> 05:11:56,310
Use the trade panel to buy and sell tools

1917
05:11:57,270 --> 05:11:59,150
spice and rares

1918
05:11:59,150 --> 05:12:02,389
Items from your cargo that can be sold will appear at the bottom of the trade panel. Okay

1919
05:12:02,389 --> 05:12:10,970
I can't it's still there click on the items in the trade panel. You wish to buy and sell I'll take this

1920
05:12:11,490 --> 05:12:16,840
Alright, let's do it

1921
05:12:16,840 --> 05:12:18,520
Let's go see space

1922
05:12:18,520 --> 05:12:25,729
Stop bragging about eating a coconut eating chocolate coconut. What's that?

1923
05:12:29,020 --> 05:12:35,860
Okay, get your spandex suit we suspect you're not alone in the galaxy. We picked up strange radio signals. Let's do it

1924
05:12:36,380 --> 05:12:45,520
It's time for interplanetary space travel. You've earned the badge and title of captain

1925
05:12:45,540 --> 05:12:55,459
Okay, your collection your Michael gives you access to your mission log badge clicking tools and rears. Hmm. Oh my god

1926
05:12:55,580 --> 05:13:12,049
This is like a the world of Warcraft achievement book. He's this loser unlocked by earning badges

1927
05:13:12,250 --> 05:13:20,360
This is cool. Some tools are consumable and require restocking others who's a permanent. Okay, cool

1928
05:13:20,520 --> 05:13:30,639
We're not gonna see any of this by the way. All right, cool. Let's go use the mouse wheel to exit the solar system. Whoa

1929
05:13:31,319 --> 05:13:41,639
Whoa, why do planet Dorges? I read I've

1930
05:13:44,040 --> 05:14:05,650
Dorges, okay, let me go in and it Dorges cool. Something is showing up on the ship's radar alien

1931
05:14:05,650 --> 05:14:22,729
It's a crash spacecraft that is emitting a strange radio signal. Why don't you use the scan tool to investigate the crash site? Okay

1932
05:14:24,139 --> 05:14:40,900
Okay, this is a cool planet. I wish I played here. All right scan it. What happened?

1933
05:14:46,770 --> 05:14:49,209
You wish you could retroactively go back and make a game score higher

1934
05:14:49,209 --> 05:14:57,279
You know how much I've fought with the fact that Outer Wilds was an 89 aliens

1935
05:14:57,279 --> 05:15:00,819
But no signs of life looks like they drew some type of cryptic map before they died

1936
05:15:01,040 --> 05:15:13,169
Wait, the wreck has triggered a transfer beam. Some items are coming aboard played out of wilds for like two hours

1937
05:15:13,169 --> 05:15:23,889
What I beat the whole game missiles and interstellar drive

1938
05:15:24,049 --> 05:15:29,090
Which seems to have an unknown stars coordinates programmed into it the wrecks damage looks like it came from a fight

1939
05:15:29,090 --> 05:15:35,159
The ship must have been sent from some of the planet to get help. No game is perfect outer wilds close

1940
05:15:35,479 --> 05:15:43,240
Well, I said 89 but I think that's cuz I was just very mad at flying into the Sun like the thousand times

1941
05:15:47,060 --> 05:16:09,159
It's probably 91. Okay, leave the solar system in a galactic view

1942
05:16:09,159 --> 05:16:20,310
What the hell it's responding to a beacon from a nearby star that matches the coordinates in his memory

1943
05:16:20,310 --> 05:16:41,200
This must be for the home planet. Why do planet Voral a hell avilus planet Voral we go in here

1944
05:16:41,279 --> 05:17:03,599
What the fuck? This is what this end game is like. It's a world to keep going into in here

1945
05:17:03,599 --> 05:17:15,840
Oh my god on top of it. The end game is running errands between space colonies

1946
05:17:18,799 --> 05:17:25,240
Nothing's glowing on the radar. It's a lot of fun, but it's really long

1947
05:17:25,360 --> 05:17:46,400
Well, at least I got to see it scanning the ruins may help reveal what happened get it

1948
05:17:47,520 --> 05:17:52,919
End of the spore voice. It's coming. It's coming pretty soon

1949
05:17:53,520 --> 05:17:57,169
Not immediately, but it's gonna happen soon

1950
05:17:59,959 --> 05:18:10,860
Activities on the radar. Oh shit other spacecraft the scam was to trigger the colony's defenses

1951
05:18:10,860 --> 05:18:13,060
These drones don't look friendly wait an incoming transmission

1952
05:18:14,659 --> 05:18:16,659
warning grok's intruders to

1953
05:18:16,740 --> 05:18:23,520
gronk's intruders all grok's intruders will be terminated initializing self-defense called gronk's

1954
05:18:24,400 --> 05:18:34,680
999 all grok's intruders will be terminated. We're not grok's all grok's will be intruders. Let's get out of here

1955
05:18:35,159 --> 05:18:51,180
Okay returned to your home world back to home world

1956
05:18:51,740 --> 05:19:02,040
Execute grok's number six sixty six or wild is like a seven. No, I disagree with that

1957
05:19:02,720 --> 05:19:11,979
Radio signals emanating from the star fly in and explore it. Isn't this where I live?

1958
05:19:12,560 --> 05:19:17,029
Oh, I got red spices

1959
05:19:17,229 --> 05:19:41,270
It's going bink bink. I was doing that mission accomplished

1960
05:19:41,509 --> 05:19:45,750
We knew we weren't alone in the galaxy trace of an extinct civilization hostile security drones in the grok's

1961
05:19:45,950 --> 05:19:51,810
It's obvious that we must continue our exploration of the galaxy and potentially prepare for hostilities

1962
05:19:51,889 --> 05:19:56,000
In order to do so we'll need to set up colonies as basis of operation

1963
05:19:56,869 --> 05:20:00,590
Scientists are already reverse engineering the interstellar drive to replicate its technology

1964
05:20:00,590 --> 05:20:04,090
We've also developed a city device for your ship

1965
05:20:04,090 --> 05:20:09,680
We'll pick up signals of other sentient life in the galaxy indicated by radio signals over stars that you target

1966
05:20:09,680 --> 05:20:18,759
We need you at the helm of our space program. Mm-hmm expand the empire and get more wealth

1967
05:20:18,840 --> 05:20:27,319
There's some volunteers to be part of the crew. Okay. Well, I'm

1968
05:20:27,919 --> 05:20:43,520
Leave me alone calling me. Okay. How do I establish a colony? Excellent placing a colony is easy

1969
05:20:44,080 --> 05:20:46,080
After flying to planet Neem on

1970
05:20:46,119 --> 05:20:51,380
Select the colony tool that has been added to your colonization tool bin and place the colony on land near a spice geyser

1971
05:20:51,659 --> 05:20:55,169
It'll instantly unpack creating a colony. No assembly required

1972
05:20:55,209 --> 05:20:59,360
I want to make contact with a colony to make sure the citizens packed in there

1973
05:21:00,099 --> 05:21:02,720
unpacked safely, okay

1974
05:21:03,319 --> 05:21:20,520
Bye, we're good to go to planet Neem on he hook you who control the spice controls the universe. All right, where's

1975
05:21:21,040 --> 05:21:37,200
Thuja to system star map filters my empire. Oh, okay. Okay missions, right?

1976
05:21:38,400 --> 05:21:50,069
Thuja to zoom out all the way baby. All right, holy shit. Well, I'm not seeing any of that

1977
05:21:50,069 --> 05:22:00,049
I gotta go to Neem on

1978
05:22:00,090 --> 05:22:12,240
Planets in green orbit paths are easier to terraform and colonize than planets on red or blue orbit paths

1979
05:22:12,240 --> 05:22:17,959
I have question question for you. So spore the game

1980
05:22:18,240 --> 05:22:26,549
They made a space simulation game and then added like a funny character creator onto the bottom of it

1981
05:22:26,549 --> 05:22:35,840
That what I did how this worked this feels like way more detailed than the rest of the entire game

1982
05:22:35,919 --> 05:22:52,930
Okay, there's Neem on base mode is a slog

1983
05:22:53,169 --> 05:22:57,209
This is 90% of the rest of the game 90% of the game from here on is the game

1984
05:22:57,529 --> 05:23:05,139
Does that mean that we did 10% of the game? Wow

1985
05:23:08,159 --> 05:23:13,950
Colonies can be established on any planet from barren moons to lush terrors go or three oasis

1986
05:23:17,290 --> 05:23:24,689
Fruitful colonies mine spice that can be traded. I said we plant a colony near the spice geysers

1987
05:23:25,090 --> 05:23:45,799
Let's get shot. There we go. I

1988
05:23:49,619 --> 05:24:01,459
Used to want place for so badly, but I only had the weird DS game. That's right. They did make a weird DS game

1989
05:24:01,459 --> 05:24:08,080
Didn't they I forgot about that completely what hold on?

1990
05:24:08,319 --> 05:24:20,880
I want to look this up. You just brought back a memory that I've buried for so long

1991
05:24:21,700 --> 05:24:39,450
Spore creatures. Yeah, I do remember this it was weird too. You have your own Empire cool. Oh, this is cool

1992
05:24:39,450 --> 05:24:41,450
We're in the endgame now Peter. So I mean, this is like cool

1993
05:24:41,970 --> 05:24:59,860
Report back to the home world report back to your home world for glory. All right, I love doing running around doing spice trades

1994
05:24:59,860 --> 05:25:07,200
Yeah, this is cool. What if I go get some I'm gonna go here. Why not? Let's go to Tantarok

1995
05:25:11,419 --> 05:25:29,540
Spore hero arena, this is cool. Cool. All right dark spore. Yeah, that was a

1996
05:25:31,540 --> 05:25:45,939
Arpg right that one was cool. This was no man's sky a decade before no man's sky. That's true

1997
05:25:46,240 --> 05:26:02,560
There's a no man's sky fun. You collected spice. It's a valued commodity. It cool depends. It's better now

1998
05:26:02,560 --> 05:26:04,439
Yeah, it's supposed to be fun now

1999
05:26:04,439 --> 05:26:11,389
Be counting on you to visit this colony frequently to collect spice from it. Oh shit. You have to actually physically go there

2000
05:26:11,790 --> 05:26:18,040
Catherine we've intercepted transmissions that we believe are coming from other advanced beings in the galaxy

2001
05:26:18,040 --> 05:26:23,319
We need to investigate attempt to establish first contact use the Shetty tool equipped on your ship to help find them

2002
05:26:23,720 --> 05:26:31,400
Okay, let's go. We've been able to pinpoint the exact location of these transmissions

2003
05:26:31,840 --> 05:26:43,909
You need to explore a bit. All right, let's go get the hell out of here

2004
05:26:44,110 --> 05:26:48,150
Find an alien Empire find another spacefaring Empire and communicate with them

2005
05:26:48,150 --> 05:26:52,229
You will know they are spacefaring once you get close enough to their harm star system

2006
05:26:52,509 --> 05:27:00,560
Establish contact with them using the short-range video communicator. All right. All right, let's go. Let's find them

2007
05:27:00,680 --> 05:27:42,150
Where are they they on future too? Oh shit. That's your colony, right? Right? Oh, hold on over here

2008
05:27:42,669 --> 05:28:05,139
Look, I'm trying to hear the radio. No radio radio means nothing. It's a visual. Okay

2009
05:28:13,540 --> 05:28:27,369
Nobody over here over to I hear something somebody over there. I'm right here somebody's here

2010
05:28:27,450 --> 05:28:39,369
Big's equation was right a living alien race

2011
05:28:39,369 --> 05:28:48,560
We're not alone looks like they have sent an envoy to greet you talk to them. Welcome. Welcome

2015
05:29:05,189 --> 05:29:08,840
I am from the great and mighty planet of Zircan

2016
05:29:09,360 --> 05:29:16,150
We agree that you are absolutely tremendous. Will you spend money now?

2017
05:29:16,549 --> 05:29:20,840
I'm not as small as you think but let's continue

2018
05:29:21,560 --> 05:29:29,290
Yes. Yes, happy to help happy to help. What can we do for you? I get my ship repaired, please and my ship recharged

2019

2020
05:29:32,479 --> 05:29:36,770
Okay, I've got some red spices. What do you think about that?

2021
05:29:37,569 --> 05:29:51,330
You have way too happy with that. That's like you have four aces in your hand at the poker table

2022
05:29:51,330 --> 05:29:57,119
Um, is it my getting I can scammed

2023
05:30:03,130 --> 05:30:07,580
Diplomacy I'd like to know about your race. Please accept a gift so we can be friends

2024
05:30:07,580 --> 05:30:12,020
I like to establish a trade route. Tell me more about your race

2025
05:30:12,540 --> 05:30:20,099
Thanks to the philosophy of prosperity. We the Kurgle Empire love everything. We love our empire. We love other empires

2026
05:30:20,500 --> 05:30:23,540
We love happy people. We love unhappy people

2027
05:30:24,020 --> 05:30:28,819
Most of all, we love our profit margins and we love all the other things because they contribute to our margins

2028
05:30:29,220 --> 05:30:35,990
Okay, you want to work with us?

2029
05:30:35,990 --> 05:30:40,189
We offer rewards equivalent to many important professions such as dock worker in dishwasher

2030
05:30:40,189 --> 05:30:46,959
I need a quest so good of you in your stature to visit one as insignificant as us

2031
05:30:47,400 --> 05:30:51,419
If it wouldn't be too much trouble, we have a favor would you travel to planet?

2032
05:30:52,000 --> 05:30:57,080
Teebo nor rawr and see what opportunities might await only if it would not be too much trouble

2033
05:30:57,479 --> 05:31:03,810
Okay, commanding a spacecraft is only half the responsibilities of a space captain

2034
05:31:03,930 --> 05:31:09,919
The other half requires planetside tactical skills where you and your crew will need to leave your spaceship and beam down to planets

2035
05:31:11,709 --> 05:31:20,189
Okay, you have to beam down like Star Trek. Let's go once you get to

2036
05:31:20,790 --> 05:31:29,290
Teebo nor rawr. You will need to beam down to the planet. Oh, that sounds like fun

2037
05:31:29,610 --> 05:31:35,139
Is it that Teebo on Teebo Ronar?

2038
05:31:35,459 --> 05:31:38,599
Turn to the homeworld. Okay

2039
05:31:38,759 --> 05:31:47,259
The allies and enemies filter will show you the regions of space controlled by friend or foe the Empire filter will show all stars

2040
05:31:47,259 --> 05:31:54,130
They're occupied by alien races. I do have the space DLC. I got it for the parts mainly

2041
05:31:56,270 --> 05:32:08,130
All right return to the homeworld and I'll go there it's too far

2042
05:32:08,209 --> 05:32:22,540
How do you compare pointer addresses and see plus plus using the modules operator turbo?

2043
05:32:22,860 --> 05:32:27,619
You could put a briefcase on the table right now with a million dollars in cash in it

2044
05:32:27,619 --> 05:32:37,799
I would not tell you how I would not have any idea the download from your data recorder is quite amazing captain

2045
05:32:37,799 --> 05:32:40,340
We had no idea other spacefaring civilizations were so close by

2046
05:32:40,759 --> 05:32:53,340
We are gonna establish our place in the galactic community. Oh, I'm in we produce spice and record amounts resulting in surplus

2047
05:32:53,340 --> 05:33:03,229
We need to look for potential buyers. All right, I get it. That sounds pretty lucrative trade partners

2048
05:33:03,330 --> 05:33:18,619
Let's go make a deal. All right, visit vat tego on planet tip on our RR

2049
05:33:18,860 --> 05:33:43,900
Okay, I'm planet bo runar. We're going where am I this is bulbar to visit vat tego and tip over an R

2050
05:33:43,900 --> 05:34:21,860
Where is it? It's the flag. There it is at tego and adventurers

2051
05:34:22,380 --> 05:34:26,779
my god, um

2052
05:34:27,220 --> 05:34:42,299
Okay, cool. Uh

2053
05:34:42,299 --> 05:34:47,080
Energy meter tracks how much energy some of the abilities using how much is stored and recharge my batteries cool

2054
05:34:49,500 --> 05:36:10,310
All right. Oh, you're good. Sounds like you're having a panic attack. What hey somehow these look worse box cock

2055
05:36:10,310 --> 05:36:32,380
I'm like that. This looks horrible. But whatever cock streamer talk. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yeah his end of the stream voice, by the way

2056
05:36:32,500 --> 05:36:50,740
Yeah, we're at the end of the stream voice. I'm losing me you add weapons. Yep, a hundred percent end of the stream voice

2057
05:36:52,299 --> 05:37:10,959
Shit I don't have any weapons though. He's losing it. No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I don't have any do I need weapons?

2058
05:37:11,000 --> 05:37:13,000
I thought this is a diplomatic mission

2059
05:37:18,380 --> 05:37:33,159
Imagine there's a conflict going on in this beams down and dabs your path will gain experience once you complete this adventure

2060
05:37:33,520 --> 05:37:43,770
Okay, let's take a look you get batteries and generators. There's the map. It's a progress bar. I

2061
05:37:50,720 --> 05:37:58,349
Talk just GTA music it is

2062
05:37:58,970 --> 05:38:32,330
But you still sing I mean the quartermaster. That's our 2d2. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here

2063
05:38:32,889 --> 05:38:34,310
Come here guy

2064
05:38:34,310 --> 05:38:46,900
Robot shall rule the earth already drop kick this thing. I feel like I'm playing an

2065
05:38:47,580 --> 05:38:50,740
MMO right now. I feel like I'm playing the city of heroes

2066
05:38:51,299 --> 05:39:07,180
Big low just arrived. And why can I save it after the head bought? All right

2067
05:39:14,560 --> 05:39:16,680
Spaceport Authority and it's your servant

2068
05:39:17,159 --> 05:39:19,439
Welcomes you captain if you look to become a great space captain

2069
05:39:19,439 --> 05:39:25,520
You've got it right you come to the right place to be afraid to have a look around and introduce yourself to the local life forms

2070
05:39:25,720 --> 05:39:31,299
If you're left the merchant will notify you of his latest merchandise and how to take possession of them

2071
05:39:31,840 --> 05:39:36,060
Behind me the space traveler will inform you of the interstellar customs for obtaining new assignments

2072
05:39:36,380 --> 05:39:39,520
This is way more detailed than all the other ones combined

2073
05:39:40,319 --> 05:39:45,759
Crew members on the right. Okay. All right. Why can I save it? I

2074
05:39:52,380 --> 05:40:03,299
Dance still this is all DLC. Oh, I love this music

2075
05:40:07,540 --> 05:40:20,250
Okay, being allies with the empires will add them to your fleet you can beam down

2076
05:40:22,049 --> 05:40:40,650
Cool, all right dance. Let's dance. You got moves like that

2077
05:40:41,409 --> 05:41:01,479
Often truly awful still can't pose. No, I can't

2078
05:41:02,400 --> 05:41:04,400
Hello, I'm the guy that sells stuff

2079
05:41:05,779 --> 05:41:14,419
Need crew members. They're over here

05:41:52,000 --> 05:41:54,919
And take on adventuring missions and shit. Oh

2083
05:41:56,200 --> 05:42:38,779
It's gonna save the game. Okay. Goodbye. There's another one. There's a look at this screen. Um, oh geez

2084
05:42:39,299 --> 05:43:06,439
Energy slash I want to go back down there. I want to be meet back down here. Holy shit up to five hours

2085
05:43:06,439 --> 05:43:08,720
I thought he didn't like this game. Wait, what? Oh

2086
05:43:09,240 --> 05:43:12,470
You must have came in here when I was defending myself as an e-clown

2087
05:43:17,759 --> 05:43:25,919
Imagine like imagine listening to that conversation. Oh, I'm not a video game streamer. I'm an e-clown

2088
05:43:26,520 --> 05:43:30,639
Okay, I don't stream video games. I mean I played them, but I'm a claw. I'm an e-clown

2089
05:43:30,639 --> 05:43:36,279
I don't care. I would have to be in full makeup on the phone

2090
05:43:36,279 --> 05:43:43,610
I think full clown makeup with a controller in my hand like a GameCube controller and a cigarette in my mouth

2091
05:43:43,970 --> 05:43:50,159
Trying to keep up with this with all the shitty that all these kids like these days

2092
05:43:50,520 --> 05:44:13,889
I'm just smushing my face in his ass

2093
05:44:20,740 --> 05:44:24,680
Goodbye, you know what? I'm done. I'll see you later. Let's see

2094
05:44:30,549 --> 05:44:49,330
Music they I say it's right before that Sunday stream, please Sunday stream, please. Sorry. You're gonna be very disappointed

2095
05:44:49,330 --> 05:44:52,979
there's no Sunday stream and

2096
05:44:53,299 --> 05:44:57,599
It's not even a Monday stream. There is a Tuesday stream

2097
05:44:58,240 --> 05:45:00,639
There is a Tuesday Wednesday Thursday stream Oh

2098
05:45:02,430 --> 05:45:12,340
Yeah, I'll be back on Tuesday, right? But today's Saturday, right Sunday, but yeah, I'll be back on Tuesday

2099
05:45:12,900 --> 05:45:17,770
I'm gonna try to get Pikmin 2 ready

2100
05:45:18,330 --> 05:45:25,279
That's the plan. I can't take this anymore. I gotta get out of this wrong thing

2101
05:45:28,580 --> 05:45:35,860
I'm gonna try to play Pikmin 2 on. Oh, that's really good. It's from that painting game such art

2102
05:45:35,860 --> 05:45:41,330
I'm gonna just retire if you hate us so much

2103
05:45:44,680 --> 05:45:51,540
What the hell oh look at that it's the bear back-to-back cool

2104
05:45:51,819 --> 05:45:57,849
We've seen a couple of those if for some if for some reason I do not play Pikmin on Tuesday

2105
05:45:57,849 --> 05:46:02,669
I'll play it on Wednesday or Thursday, but the plan is to try to get Pikmin ready

2106
05:46:02,909 --> 05:46:04,909
Try to have everything set up and play Pikmin 2

2107
05:46:05,930 --> 05:46:13,040
If it's not Pikmin 2 on Tuesday, then it'll be a mystery game and then we'll play and hopefully beat Pikmin 2

2108
05:46:13,720 --> 05:46:32,930
Next week play Nintendo land by yourself. Will you beat spore?

2109
05:46:34,430 --> 05:46:41,599
No, this is probably the last time you're gonna see spore. It was very fun

2110
05:46:41,599 --> 05:46:44,639
I heavily enjoyed my time except for about

2111
05:46:45,200 --> 05:46:47,200
except for the for the part of

2112
05:46:47,240 --> 05:46:51,080
It was like a 10-minute portion of the civilization phase

2113
05:46:51,259 --> 05:46:54,840
Had to skip it because I didn't like it and I wanted to get out of there

2114
05:46:54,880 --> 05:47:03,340
What would you give spore for a rating 89 now 87?

2115
05:47:07,360 --> 05:47:16,419
Too much of water. It's not an 87. It's on it realistically

2116
05:47:16,819 --> 05:47:20,540
The crew okay the creature part the creature creator is like a 95

2117
05:47:20,740 --> 05:47:37,750
the video game of spore is like a 4 if I have to be totally honest, but like the creature stuff is

2118
05:47:38,430 --> 05:47:43,130
No, I would say even like 98 when that first came out. That was such a big deal

2119
05:47:43,189 --> 05:47:45,909
but like the video game portion of it is

2120
05:47:46,919 --> 05:47:56,490
Mmm, like a 4.8 for like the video game portion. So you average those two together. No, no, no, that's not for it

2121
05:47:56,490 --> 05:48:07,319
Let's say 6 a 9.8 and a 6 together is an 8.7. It's important bits about thousand-year door. There is I mean

2122
05:48:07,319 --> 05:48:15,080
Let me look at let me okay. Here's some bits. Jerma film yourself eating an entire jar of olives now. That's not thousand-year door

2123
05:48:15,080 --> 05:48:22,330
Uh chat don't tell them just take your time and have fun Jerma. You don't need to rush

2124
05:48:25,830 --> 05:48:33,270
Where did your brain is bad Jerma? I think you want the game's journalist difficulty

2125
05:48:33,270 --> 05:48:48,270
I don't see anything about thousand-year door. That was like my favorite part of the whole night

2126
05:48:48,349 --> 05:49:00,139
If you want to play a thousand-year door, please play the way you want not the way others people say to do it

2127
05:49:00,139 --> 05:49:14,560
I've been told that I'm gonna get heavily backseated in thousand-year door. I'm ready for it whenever we play it

2128
05:49:14,639 --> 05:49:18,569
It's a bug for the original thousand-year door game

2129
05:49:18,569 --> 05:49:32,810
It's very important that before you start playing you take a stinky whatever there was the spore city level also filled with concrete

2130
05:49:32,810 --> 05:49:39,900
I don't know. I thought that was a photo of me for a second

2131
05:49:40,419 --> 05:49:47,060
Alright, I'll see you guys on on Tuesday. If it's not Pikmin 2 then it'll be something else

2132
05:49:47,959 --> 05:49:53,529
Expect Pikmin 2 within the next two or three streams. That was spore. It was a lot of fun

2133
05:49:53,810 --> 05:50:03,970
Thanks for watching as always everybody. Thanks for hanging out for as long as you have

2134
05:50:04,389 --> 05:50:11,290
Yeah, it is getting late Eastern time. So I know a lot of people are you know getting tired

2135
05:50:11,290 --> 05:50:26,560
So let me get to the the credits a little bit more art. Here's all the subs from today

2136
05:50:27,080 --> 05:50:35,849
Resubs gifted subs everything. Thanks a lot as always everybody. Let them roll

2137
05:50:36,369 --> 05:50:41,279
You inspired me to reinstall spore and play it again

2138
05:50:41,279 --> 05:50:46,819
It's I mean if I joke about a lot of the shit in there you guys know, it's just jokes, right?

2139
05:50:46,979 --> 05:50:56,330
It doesn't deserve a four about it. I mean it does but it doesn't right. It's a fucked up

2140
05:50:56,330 --> 05:51:11,080
I know I know how long I'm gonna try it. Can I grab it?

2141
05:51:11,759 --> 05:51:24,250
Hey, I fixed it. We said they would literally give me a copy of thousand-year door if you need it

2142
05:51:24,250 --> 05:51:28,560
I will not take it. I appreciate it though. I

2143
05:51:29,840 --> 05:51:43,750
Do not I will not I do not accept anything from anyone. Don't just let you know for the future about two copies

2144
05:51:44,389 --> 05:51:59,590
Except for money. I mean you got you you got me you got my what am I gonna?

2145
05:51:59,590 --> 05:52:01,310

2146
05:52:01,310 --> 05:52:08,250
Well, but money also doesn't I mean look the the systems in place for twitch for you to send bits or subscribe

2147

2148
05:52:24,380 --> 05:52:29,450

05:53:04,020 --> 05:53:16,069

2161
05:54:13,650 --> 05:54:17,200

2162
05:54:17,200 --> 05:54:20,540
