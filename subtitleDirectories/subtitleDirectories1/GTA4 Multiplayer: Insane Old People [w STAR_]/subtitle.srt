1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:08,320
Now you listen here, you bumped me, and my car, and my wife, and she's pissed about it, now I gotta call the insurance.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,820
Granny wants this car, motherfucker.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,689
You see what you did? You see what you did now? Now you're dead.

4
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,750
Alright, let's get out of here. Let's get the fuck out of here, quick.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,469
No, no, no, why you?

6
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:24,469
Oh no, I've left it on.

7
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:26,969
I'm holding a loan.

8
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,899
I'm coming, Elizabeth, I'm coming to join you.

9
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:57,380
This lady is going the wrong way on the off-ramp.

10
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:04,519
This lady is shit-faced.

11
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,260
Don't you see the signs, lady?

12
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,260
Oh my god.

13
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:22,349
She finally stopped.

14
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:29,540
What? Is she dead?

15
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:36,680
I think this old lady just died behind the wheel. I swear.

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,290
Is she? Hold on a second.

17
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,290
Hold on a second.

18
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,019
She's dead.

19
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:50,159
That's bad news. You shouldn't be this happy.

20
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,159
I don't think you understand what just happened. That's never been...

21
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,049
No.

22
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,340
What is with these dying old people?

23
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,409
Oh my god.

24
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:24,629
Get in the car.

25
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,629
Hold your horses, I got a stubbed toe here. I got like a bad knee.

26
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:30,629
What are you doing?

27
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:32,870
I'm getting in.

28
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,870
What are you doing out here at this hour in this fog?

29
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,870
It's this bad in London. I don't remember it being this bad here.

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,870
This is not even London.

31
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,870
That's what I'm saying.

32
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,870
This is San Francisco, are you fucking stupid?

33
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,870
You're stupid. I don't know how to be stupid.

34
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,870
Oh no, you just fucking ran over a bunch of people.

35
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,870
Oh my god.

36
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,870
Hide the bodies.

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,870
No, you fucking idiot.

38
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,870
Hide the bodies.

39
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,870
All right, pick them up.

40
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,870
You're not supposed to shoot me.

41
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,870
Do you like my old woman voice?

42
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,939
Yes, which one of them is it? I know. You told me to come look at the house.

43
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,939
I don't know which house it is.

44
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,939
I see one on the left.

45
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,759
Which further down?

46
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,020
Oh, okay. Yeah, I see it. I see the house.

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,020
Now, this is for sale? How much is this house?

48
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,020
You're going to show me.

49
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:41,620
Okay. Geez, it's a tough drive to come down.

50
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,620
What kind of house is this?

51
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,620
Hey, uh, I'm the guy you're meeting.

52
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,620
I'm sorry. I don't have legs, so they made me become part of a bike.

53
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,990
I am this bike.

54
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,300
You got the drugs?

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,300
I have the drugs. I'm just so excited about these drugs.

56
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Oh, yes. I'd love some crack.

57
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,300
I'd also love some cocaine.

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,300
It's not worth it.

59
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,520
No, come back. I just need those drugs.

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:22,750
This is confusing me so much.

61
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,250
This is seriously so confusing.

62
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:32,730
I feel like I'm moving, but I'm not at all.

63
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,269
Can I get, like, hit?

64
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:36,699
Hold on.

65
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:37,699
I'm throwing punches.

66
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,699
If a car runs into me, will I bump into it?

67
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,879
No, I go right through it.

68
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,209
I mean, I guess this is a good bike.

69
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,209
I'm just going to get off of it, you know?

70
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,209
No sense in, like, you know, staying on the bike.

71
00:04:50,209 --> 00:05:04,240
What would I want to stay on the bike for, you know what I mean?

72
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,709
All right, he looks like the main character from Katamari Damacy.

73
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,709
You know, Katamari.

74
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,709
He, like, it's too heavy.

75
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:21,550
He's just like, eh.

76
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,759
Why's he wearing his nuts?

77
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,759
Oh, it's just hard driving his bike like this.

78
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, it's tough, you know.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,750
You can't get any sleep on the road for crying out loud.

80
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,750
This is so dumb.

81
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:45,730
I'm telling you for the last time, you shouldn't divorce me.

82
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,730
You shouldn't do it.

83
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,730
I don't want to be married to any man that would grow a mustache just to spite me.

84
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,730
Yeah, I did.

85
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,730
I did grow it just to spite you.

86
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,730
You're right.

87
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,899
Because you're old.

88
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,209
Well, he looks ugly.

89
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,209
You're ugly.

90
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,209
Bill, you got to...

91
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,209
You're a bitch.

92
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:02,209
I'm supposed to talk to him about this.

93
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,209
You need to pipe the fuck down while I...

94
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,209
Hey, Bill doesn't need to know.

95
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,209
He just needs to sign the papers.

96
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,209
We're just here to tell him.

97
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:10,209
We need to sign the papers.

98
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,209
Bill, where are the papers?

99
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,209
Bill, where are the papers?

100
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,209
Just let us know.

101
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:17,149
I don't think I have the papers on me right now.

102
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,149
He doesn't have the papers.

103
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,149
Look, the papers are in your office.

104
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:21,149
We'll just go over there.

105
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,149
You care if we go to your office?

106
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,329
I'm not sure you can...

107
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:25,329
We're going to your office.

108
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:26,329
Yes!

109
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:27,329
Hey, guess what?

110
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,329
You know why we're going to your office?

111
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,329
Fucking kill him.

112
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:30,629
Kill this motherfucker.

113
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:38,139
What the hell?

114
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,220
All right.

115
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,420
Jerma?

116
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,730
Yes.

117
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,730
Welcome.

118
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,029
I think we finally died.

119
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:51,779
This is the end of the land.

120
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,220
Come with me.

121
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
Come back.

122
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,220
Come back.

123
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,220
No.

124
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
It's my turn.

125
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,680
You never hold my hand anymore.

126
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
I'm getting it.

127
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm getting it.

128
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
And you're the grandmother.

129
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:18,860
You killed the guy.

130
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,170
I don't know how you got in there like that quickly.

131
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,649
It's these things on the top that are keeping me in.

132
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:33,649
You're in.

133
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:34,649
You're in.

134
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
They said it couldn't be done.

135
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
They said it couldn't be done.

136
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Look how many cars are in the ceiling.

137
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
What did you do?

138
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
I fucked this whole thing up.
