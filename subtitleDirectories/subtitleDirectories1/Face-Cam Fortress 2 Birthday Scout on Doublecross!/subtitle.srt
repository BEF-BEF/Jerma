00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:20,420
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, playing as the Scout on CTF Doublecross.

2
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:30,539
And before we get into the video, playing Scout and talking, my brain will not be able to handle this. See you later.

3
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:37,890
Today's my birthday. I am 27 years old, September 22nd, 2012. Jerma is 27.

4
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:46,369
So, what does this mean? This means I'm getting old. I'm on the later part of my 20s.

5
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:56,780
Because I used to be able to say I was in my mid-20s, and I can't really say that anymore because 7, 8, 9 is a lot closer to 30 than something like 24, 25, or 26.

6
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,780
So now, I am a full-fleshed adult. A real adult.

7
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,840
Is that a spy? Oh my god. What is this guy doing, man? This guy is acting like a spy.

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:17,219
There's nothing I can do besides try and get away from this guy. Oh my god. I actually got away.

9
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:30,709
Oh, he got me with a needle right in my back. Oh dear god. Good shot, Medic. Coffee.

10
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:36,769
Actually, this is blueberry iced coffee. Please, I'm going to just beg you guys.

11
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:46,939
If you drink coffee, if you like the taste of coffee, and you have one maybe once in the morning or something, or maybe once every couple days you'll have one, please try blueberry coffee.

12
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:54,180
Blueberry coffee is phenomenal. You will not regret it. It is one of my favorite things in the entire world.

13
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,379
So please go try some blueberry iced coffee if you like coffee.

14
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:08,280
This heavy Medic parry. This is bad news. Oh, not anymore. This guy. Come on. Get out of here.

15
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:25,099
Nope. I gotta get the intelligence. That's the number one thing here. Oh hey, so that's a spy. For sure.

16
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:34,409
Bumped right into his butt. Oh, scout on scout. Scout on scout. More scout on scout. Who wants it? More! Who wants some of this?

17
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:43,979
I'm dead. Oh, I'm so dead. Oh my god. How do I keep escaping from these things? I'm insane right now.

18
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:52,610
Something's going on. The gods of Team Fortress 2 are being insane. They are letting me do this.

19
00:02:52,610 --> 00:03:01,199
Because normally I would get myself killed in all these situations. So, let me get that intelligence.

20
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:13,780
Oh, I just heard a sentry. There's no way. Oh, it's not up yet. No, I didn't want to go this way. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it.

21
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:26,229
Oh, no. I did not want to do this. I'm dead. I can't even hit this guy. Oh my god. That was so lucky.

22
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:35,610
I can't walk by here. I cannot. There's nowhere I can go. I might as well just sit here with my fingers in my face.

23
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:44,680
Hold on. I can get up there. Come on. Come on. This is embarrassing.

24
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:56,139
Well, so I'll tell you a story while I sit here and can't jump over this thing. Oh, it's not up. It's not up. It's not up.

25
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:08,580
Oh, wow. That was got to use that. My noggin wasn't being functioning right there. Unfortunately.

26
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:17,199
Are we going to cap it? What's going on here? Let's cap that thing.

27
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:26,589
Yay. I have a new rank on my strange scatter gun. This guy is going to run into that.

28
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:35,610
I just got so confused right there. Oh, I'll take this guy out right in his back. Come on.

29
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:45,079
Spy up top. Oh, baby. Give me those crits. Get crit. Get crit. Where is he?

30
00:04:45,079 --> 00:05:03,019
Damn. Whoa. Whoa. Did I get him? At least I got him. Didn't get the heavy though. Oh, yeah. Blueberry iced coffee, baby.

31
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:08,649
But the beginning of this video, before all this weird stuff started happening, I'm getting old, guys.

32
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:15,379
I'm starting to feel kind of like grandpa. My joints hurt. My neck hurts. My face hurts.

33
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:22,620
I wake up in the morning sometimes and I'm just like, my god, what did I eat for lunch last night? I have diarrhea.

34
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:38,089
Oh my god. But that is starting to happen now. I'm an actual real, real, real adult. And it's kind of scary.

35
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:47,500
I'll get that guy up there. I will get that guy right now. Get me up here. Get me up the stairs.

36
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,300
Around the corner. Around the bend.

37
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:04,009
Take it out. Come on. Come on here. Come on. Come on. I can get that sentry. I can get it.

38
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:18,790
I'm going to get this sentry down. Come on. Yes. Wow. Get it. Get that. Oh, good job, demo man.

39
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,790
Damn it. I should have went for him first because he was eating a sandwich. I should have killed him.

40
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,790
And I should have killed the sandwich eating heavy, but I didn't do that. I didn't get the heavy.

41
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:32,089
This respawn time is really, really long. We'll get it and we're going to get it. We're going to win for sure.

42
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:43,850
Come on, guys. Come on, guys. Come on, guys. Somebody pick it up. The ambassador. Here we are. Here we are.

43
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:55,939
You are a spy. That. Take that. They got our intelligence. That's not cool.

44
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:07,350
Not going in that front door. No bags. Go around the sewer. We'll go into the sewer and like stink like a sewer rat.

45
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:23,620
You know, where am I going? Excuse me. I'm going to get this. I'm going to cap this. God damn. Why? What?

46
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:35,129
What the hell is going on? Oh, he's putting stickies down. Oh, he doesn't even know I'm there. Watch this.

47
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:42,069
Oh, my God. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. At least I'm going to get it.

48
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:46,069
I'll get it far enough so that somebody can get it on the other team. On my team. Come on. Somebody pick that up.

49
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:52,589
Pick that up. Somebody. Come on. Somebody get that. It's right there. Come on. Somebody get that.

50
00:07:52,589 --> 00:08:02,360
Come on, spy. Just touch it. Just touch it, spy. No, no. I'm going to get that. I'm going to cap it right now.

51
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:12,560
Whoa. No, I'm not. What is this guy doing here? How do we get two people spawn camping? Spawn camping.

52
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:31,870
Dude, let's go. I'm doing this thing. I need some backup. Come on. Oh, need to get that. Need to touch it.

53
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:40,529
Need to touch it. I touched it. Yes. Yes. All right. Now somebody go over there and grab it.

54
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:47,659
We can win this right now. We can win this right freaking now. Touch it. Come on, man. Good. Good. Good.

55
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:56,659
Oh, come on. We got to get this. Come on. I'm going to get this. It's going to happen.

56
00:08:56,659 --> 00:09:15,759
Oh, now they got a soldier here. No, I got it. I got it. No, I'm getting stuck on stuff. Oh, this is it.

57
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:23,889
That's not a spy. Where am I going? What am I doing that for? Oh, my God. My brain just fried, but this is going to be it.

58
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:29,259
And boom. Thank you guys so much for watching Face Camp Fortress 2.

59
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:35,750
Germa the old man. I'm old now, so 27 years old. I'm so sad.

60
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,750
But anyways, thank you so much for watching, guys. I really do appreciate it.

61
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,750
And I'll catch you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
