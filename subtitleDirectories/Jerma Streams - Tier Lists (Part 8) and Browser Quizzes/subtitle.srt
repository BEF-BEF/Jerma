1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:06,650
I-I'm on time. We're waiting pa- I'm on time. I'm here.

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:12,919
I pressed the button at 2 o'clock.

3
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,410
It took an extra 45 seconds to get through the internet tubes, okay?

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,059
You understand the remarkable tech no- my throat is all screwed up.

5
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,460
Come with me, I'll just wait here.

6
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,460
Well, my nose is.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,939
Gotta figure out what's going on inside the, uh, inside the nasal passages here.

8
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:37,939
Some of you know, I've had some nasal problems over the last 6 months or so.

9
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,340
Last few months at least.

10
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,619
It's got- I just went to the doctor recently.

11
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:43,219
Again.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,189
Probably why my nose is irritated.

13
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,899
I've got these annoying things that I have to deal with.

14
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,500
And it's stupid.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,299
It's stupid.

16
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,579
Anyways, how you doin'?

17
00:00:58,979 --> 00:00:59,780
He's drunk.

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,579
Ha ha ha!

19
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,179
Ah, by the way, I drank a fuckin' pint!

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,569
This guy's- it's too much cocaine.

21
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:11,670
No.

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,379
I've- I've- this- no.

23
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,180
God.

24
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,329
Alright, let me tweet- we're gonna do some tier lists today.

25
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,370
And some browser, uh, just stuff.

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,780
We're gonna do- we're gonna- essentially what we're doing today.

27
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:32,980
Is it- you know what? I'll tell you in a minute.

28
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,579
I'll tell you in like a minute or two.

29
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,780
Let me tweet this and I'll be right back.

30
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,139
It's a boring title.

31
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:42,090
But what- what do you want me to have the title- you know, what are- what should the title be?

32
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,930
My titles tell you precisely what is going to happen on this stream.

33
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,020
It's just quick, it's to the point that you- you know what you're gonna get, right?

34
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,349
Facecam?

35
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,550
Uh, I- I don't know.

36
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,550
I don't know about today.

37
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,550
I think of course there's gonna be a facecam.

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,919
Stop asking for it!

39
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,520
Stop asking for it!

40
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,009
Sorry, I got- I just got a little upset about that one.

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
I've- I've been in another mood today.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,879
This is gonna be a weird stream.

43
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,919
I'm already in a-

44
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:32,580
This is two streams in a row where I'm just in one of those moods.

45
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,259
Remember, did you strangle somebody behind a dumpster or two- no.

46
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,860
Why would I ever, like, say yes?

47
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,780
What kind of question- why would I ever say yes to that question?

48
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:55,539
Nobody asked that.

49
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,439
Do I like art?

50
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,479
Yeah, of course I do.

51
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,259
All right, you guys ready?

52
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,790
Are you ready?

53
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,009
Hi.

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,290
So, as you see here- it's kind of dark in here, isn't it?

55
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,810
Whatever.

56
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:28,980
It's too big.

57
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:40,189
Okay, so, I have to update my fast food tier list.

58
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,790
Some of these are updates.

59
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,670
I've eaten at a lot more of these places, but actually there's still a lot that I have not.

60
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:50,470
And pardon my voice.

61
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:52,470
Every so often it's gonna go-

62
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,670
With sounds and words coming out and I'm gonna have to go-

63
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,689
Apologize for that.

64
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:01,699
You got a haircut?

65
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,259
When was the last time you guys saw me on camera?

66
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:12,990
How long has it been since I've been on camera?

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,319
Couple weeks?

68
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:16,889
No, I don't think so.

69
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,089
Smoker?

70
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,290
I don't smoke cigarettes.

71
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,290
I don't smoke anything.

72
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,939
I need to make it a little-

73
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,819
Hold on.

74
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,160
Needs to be- the brightness has to come up a little bit.

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,899
Right?

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,519
Yeah.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,600
Yeah, it does.

78
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:43,939
You look drunk.

79
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
I don't look drunk.

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,600
I don't look drunk.

81
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:53,889
Dude, are you drunk?

82
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,290
I'm not drunk!

83
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,069
Okay, I want like brightness.

84
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:08,860
That's better.

85
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
Well, that's kind of weird.

86
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,060
It looks like pixelated, doesn't it?

87
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:16,730
Is it better?

88
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,540
That's a little better, right?

89
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,120
Okay, I think that's okay for now.

90
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:32,649
Okay, I'm done stalling.

91
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,079
Don't worry, I'm high too.

92
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,279
I'm not high.

93
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,899
Put the contrast down or up?

94
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,930
Okay, we're gonna start.

95
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,730
I'm gonna update some tier lists.

96
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,899
Hi, everybody.

97
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:57,899
Welcome back.

98
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:59,100
Be entertaining.

99
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,389
That curtain hadn't even gone up yet!

100
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,790
This is relaxed!

101
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,389
I can stop screaming at you.

102
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
All right, A&W.

103
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,860
We're gonna start here.

104
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,189
A&W.

105
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,019
I'd like- I like the root beer,

106
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
but I've never eaten at an A&W restaurant before.

107
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
Do they even exist?

108
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,259
Is A&W like Blockbuster?

109
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,060
Like this one left somewhere?

110
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,259
Like in the middle of like,

111
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,060
Ohio or something somewhere?

112
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,060
Where is it?

113
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:41,939
I've never heard of this.

114
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,939
It's in Canada.

115
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,300
I think it just woke up.

116
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,300
I did not just wake up.

117
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
I know I ha- look.

118
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,459
Excuse me.

119
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:56,300
I need to tell you this.

120
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,300
So over the last like few months, whatever.

121
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,100
You know what I mean?

122
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,100
Like, okay.

123
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,750
I have like permanent wake-up voice.

124
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:06,629
If that makes any sense.

125
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,439
I have permanent wake-up voice.

126
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,779
From this nasal shit going on,

127
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,579
that has not gone away.

128
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,699
I don't think it's- I'm not getting old.

129
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,259
I have like these cysts that are in my sinuses.

130
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,060
There's one-

131
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,660
There's one right here in particular,

132
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,259
like right there in the back.

133
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,230
It's like this big or something.

134
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,060
It's like maybe this.

135
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:30,860
Like here.

136
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:31,970
Right there.

137
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,220
Like that.

138
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,460
They're like these little circles.

139
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,769
And they're pissing me off.

140
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,370
They're causing me all kinds of fucking problems.

141
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,919
Are you pregnant?

142
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,799
Arby's sucks.

143
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,200
I have-

144
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,000
I've had it like-

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,799
I've- I've- okay.

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,600
The last time I did this tier list,

147
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,840
I ha- I think I said the same thing.

148
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,269
I haven't eaten Arby's in a long time.

149
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:09,870
I think I've had it one time,

150
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,669
and it was the same opinion that I had

151
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,100
when I had it like two years ago.

152
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,899
Three years ago, right?

153
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:17,779
I just don't- I don't like it.

154
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:19,210
If I'm- okay.

155
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:21,210
If I'm gonna have a deli sandwich,

156
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,700
I'm just gonna-

157
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,299
I'm gonna make it at my house.

158
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:28,710
If I want like a turkey and cheese deli sandwich,

159
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,259
I could- I could just do that at my house.

160
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,299
That's like the reason why I don't really care about Arby's.

161
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,539
When I go to like a restaurant,

162
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:41,139
I like to get stuff that I can't really get at my house.

163
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,019
Stuff that tastes different,

164
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,419
is prepared differently, right?

165
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:48,460
Maybe it's not, you know,

166
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,259
it's probably not fair to put it in poor,

167
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,259
because it's just like deli sandwiches.

168
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,029
It's not like bad.

169
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:57,110
I did just say it sucks,

170
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,509
but that's like- that's fake.

171
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,490
I didn't mean that.

172
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,440
All right.

173
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,639
This is, uh,

174
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:09,460
a- a- a Bon Pain.

175
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,340
I actually have- I've walked,

176
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:13,940
I think by this restaurant,

177
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,139
like three or four times.

178
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,240
I think I've seen it on like Google Maps.

179
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
I've never eaten here.

180
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:30,500
I have like opened up like Google Maps to look for food,

181
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,100
and I've seen it pop up.

182
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:36,190
But I've just never- I'm just like, why?

183
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,029
Onions is-

184
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,909
I'm not- I don't like the buttery pretzel.

185
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:44,620
I like a hard,

186
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,419
like bronze pretzel on the outside.

187
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,419
That's kind of crunchy.

188
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,019
Onions is like kind of soft and buttery.

189
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,220
I don't like- it's like more-

190
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,820
it's more bread than pretzel to me.

191
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:56,580
I hope you die.

192
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,539
And a lot of this guy.

193
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,440
I like, uh,

194
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,080
really like crusty kind of dark pretzel on the outside.

195
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:14,580
And Onions is-

196
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,610
it's kind of like bread.

197
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:17,980
It's not-

198
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,779
I know pretzels are bread.

199
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,580
I know, I get it.

200
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,940
But it's like eating bread,

201
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:25,500
not like pretzel bread.

202
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,500
Does that make any sense?

203
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,460
I feel like when I go to Onions,

204
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,659
I feel like I'm eating like a dinner roll,

205
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,159
not a pretzel.

206
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,779
Am I insane?

207
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,580
I don't think I am.

208
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:37,460
I like it,

209
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,059
but I'd rather have like a different kind of pretzel.

210
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
You have awful taste.

211
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,240
Oh, just wait till we get to Domino's,

212
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,639
or you have no idea it's going S tier.

213
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,090
Okay, uh, Baja Fresh.

214
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,379
I've never had it.

215
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,779
This is Baskin Robbins.

216
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,740
I'm going to put Baskin Robbins in good because of one particular-

217
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,740
I got- my fingernails are a little too long.

218
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,179
I'm going to put Baskin Robbins up in good

219
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,669
because of one type of ice cream they have,

220
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,049
and that is their Mom's Making Cookies ice cream.

221
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,940
It's so unbelievably good.

222
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,700
It's like one of the best ice creams I've ever had in my life.

223
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:29,500
I made a tweet about it.

224
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,980
Yeah.

225
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,179
And the tweet like sucks.

226
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:34,179
I went back and like looked at that old like tweet.

227
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,779
I was like, this joke sucks.

228
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,779
And I wanted to delete it,

229
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,269
but I didn't keep it there.

230
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,539
But yeah, Mom's Making Cookies puts this in good.

231
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,139
It's got other stuff is good there too.

232
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:52,230
I would probably put it here if it wasn't for that one type.

233
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,799
Now, here's the worst part.

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,200
Actually, I'm considering dropping it down to average

235
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,240
and because that shit's not year round.

236
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,200
It's like a weird seasonal thing that they put up sometimes.

237
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,000
It's the best flavor you've ever had.

238
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,789
You can- Baskin Robbins, listen to me, please God.

239
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:15,659
You can- you can take off like strawberry cheesecake.

240
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,190
You can take off like Rocky Road.

241
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,600
I just put it up there.

242
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,799
Take- take off strawberry cheesecake and put this on.

243
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,419
You know how many times you go- how many times you go on to like Baskin Robbins

244
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:32,220
and there's a tub that like had not even been used.

245
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,259
Like shit's not even been opened.

246
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,259
Nobody's ordering it.

247
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,759
They definitely have data.

248
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,159
Just take the one that like nobody's ordering

249
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,159
and fucking just replace it with Mom's Making Cookies permanently.

250
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
I don't know why it's not there permanently.

251
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,669
It's the best thing they have.

252
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,269
Strawberry cheesecake was-

253
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,789
I mean, that was just me saying a random one.

254
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,590
I'm just saying there's ones there that like have been there forever.

255
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,860
And I'm going to be- maybe I'll sound like a weirdo here.

256
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,620
Why do we have vanilla ice cream still there?

257
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,480
I don't- I've never- I don't think I've ordered a just vanilla ice cream

258
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,159
in 10 to 15 years.

259
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,919
When was the last time you ordered just like,

260
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,519
oh yeah, I'll take one scoop of vanilla ice cream, please,

261
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,019
from one of these places.

262
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,019
I mean, like, yeah, everyone- it's good.

263
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:24,620
It is good.

264
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,950
But like put it in the back in a freezer.

265
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,950
Because nobody- people don't order it.

266
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,549
Who orders a vanilla ice cream?

267
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,149
You order like- I want like half Oreo cookie.

268
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,950
I want like half cheesecake.

269
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,549
Nobody gets just vanilla ice cream in a cup.

270
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
This is the worst take.

271
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
I don't think it is.

272
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,059
You can get vanilla ice cream everywhere.

273
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:54,370
Baskin Robbins, all these like craft ice cream places.

274
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,570
It's like, oh, look at all our crazy craft ice creams.

275
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:58,769
And then you got vanilla ice cream just sitting there.

276
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,009
Not even vanilla bean, by the way.

277
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,500
Excuse me.

278
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,960
I can get vanilla ice cream anywhere.

279
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,960
I tell you, my re- look, my restaurant opinions

280
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,559
are based on getting things that I can't get anywhere else.

281
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,710
I can't get moms making cookies anywhere else but Baskin Robbins

282
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:18,909
for like two months out of the year or whatever it is.

283
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,950
I can get vanilla ice cream in 700 fucking locations

284
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:27,299
within five miles from my current location.

285
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,960
I don't think I have to explain this.

286
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,779
It's staying an average.

287
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,539
I have eaten all tubs of Ben and Jerry's pint ice creams

288
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,940
in more than like five to ten thousand times, I think.

289
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:46,940
Well, that's way too much.

290
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:51,919
That's, um, half baked is the best probably ice cream

291
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,919
you can get at any grocery store or any place.

292
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,559
Half baked.

293
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,759
And Ben and Jerry's does this awesome thing

294
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
that other ice cream places don't do.

295
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,320
So Ben and Jerry's does this thing.

296
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,419
And I may have had this opinion a few years ago,

297
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
but I'm going to reiterate it.

298
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,169
You, they don't fucking skimp on the cookie dough.

299
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,460
It's not these little teeny little sand crystals of cookie dough.

300
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,899
They give you these like gobs of cookie dough.

301
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:21,409
Huge chunks of fudge brownie.

302
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,639
They don't, that's why they're up here.

303
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,830
I hate, there's nothing more that I hate

304
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,029
than eating a cookie dough ice cream

305
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,330
and you get to like the four or five little chunks of cookie dough

306
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:37,129
that are in there and the rest of it is just ice cream.

307
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,929
And you have like half of your entire treat

308
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,330
that is just ice cream.

309
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:42,730
And there's no cookie dough left at all.

310
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,480
Ben and Jerry's has cookie dough or fudge in almost every single bite

311
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,480
if you want to.

312
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:50,850
And that's the best part about it.

313
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:54,049
You can like, you can maneuver around Ben and Jerry's tub.

314
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:57,330
Let's say you don't want a bite that has cookie dough in it.

315
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:58,730
Oh, it's available for you.

316
00:16:58,929 --> 00:16:59,330
It's available.

317
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:01,330
There's a little space right there you can carve into.

318
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:04,789
That's by far the best ice cream brand that you can just buy.

319
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,589
I like a store.

320
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:11,349
I don't know what Biscuitville is.

321
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,910
Bro, that's not a restaurant.

322
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:22,140
Wait, yes it is.

323
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,990
Don't they have, yes it is.

324
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:29,660
They have Ben and Jerry's like little like restaurants and stuff.

325
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:30,259
Yeah, they do.

326
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,549
They have locations.

327
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:39,690
Blaze Pizza.

328
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,779
I'm going to put Blaze, hold on.

329
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
I know everyone's freaking out.

330
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,059
Blaze Pizza might sit somewhere here,

331
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:57,859
but I almost feel like it's unfair for...

332
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,430
Okay, I'm going to go on.

333
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,339
I'm going to tell you a cookie dough rant here for Blaze Pizza.

334
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:10,839
Blaze Pizza does half pies.

335
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,559
It's a little rectangle box and it's half a pizza.

336
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,740
It's actually pretty awesome.

337
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,759
Forget about the taste.

338
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,559
Just the fact that they package that that way.

339
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,160
You can order a half pizza and you can DIY the whole thing.

340
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:37,180
Yeah, I'm going to keep it here for now.

341
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,410
Because I think I've only had it like a handful of times

342
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:42,609
and I don't really remember how much I liked or disliked it.

343
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,380
It's definitely better than the Domino's.

344
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,960
Blimpie.

345
00:18:54,849 --> 00:19:00,759
Blimpie?

346
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,759
Why does this look like somebody wanted to put like Subway in a video game

347
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,140
and not get like copyright striked?

348
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,220
That's like what I'm seeing.

349
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,910
What is this?

350
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:14,710
I never heard of it.

351
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:16,849
Blimpie.

352
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,829
I don't know.

353
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,230
I love subs though.

354
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,359
It sucks.

355
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:24,960
I've never had it.

356
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,700
I can't say that.

357
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,700
Bob Evans restaurant.

358
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:34,390
I've had Bob Evans mashed potatoes, the microwave ones.

359
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:35,789
And those are...

360
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,319
Can I rate those?

361
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,720
Can I rate the whole restaurant based only on the mashed potatoes

362
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,519
and the microwave section?

363
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,279
Is this even the same person?

364
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,880
Is this even the same company?

365
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,000
Make a new meme.

366
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,569
No, because the rest of the place is not...

367
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:01,970
It's your tier list.

368
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I don't think that's fair.

369
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,099
I would put their mashed potatoes like somewhere up here though.

370
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,299
Although they could be a little too salty sometimes.

371
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,099
Depends.

372
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,200
But the microwave Bob Evans is pretty good.

373
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,589
I don't know about the rest of the restaurant.

374
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:21,390
Bojangles I've not had.

375
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:23,140
Boston Market.

376
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,329
It's been a long time, but it's good.

377
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,789
I think it's very good, but I don't remember how good.

378
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:35,430
Make a meme.

379
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,630
All right, fine.

380
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:37,930
No, never mind.

381
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,730
I was going to just show you like all my teeth and I don't want to do that.

382
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,660
I was going to put my fingers in like this and just go like that.

383
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,079
No, that would be very bad.

384
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:49,150
I've never had it.

385
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,460
Roosters?

386
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,019
I've never had this.

387
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:59,259
Burger Fi.

388
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,960
Or is that Burger Florida?

389
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,650
I've never had it.

390
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,250
What is this one?

391
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,849
Burger M?

392
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:13,940
What's Burger Fi and Burger M?

393
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,539
Are these two the same place?

394
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:18,619
I don't know.

395
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:33,380
Burger M and Burger Fi.

396
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:34,579
Burger King is just...

397
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:35,779
It's just not.

398
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,420
I'm trying to think if I would rather eat Burger King or Domino's.

399
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:51,869
And I would rather eat Burger King.

400
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:53,470
This is going to get cleaned up.

401
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,109
Relax, I'm going to clean this up.

402
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:58,109
So people are saying, I can't believe Arby's is ahead of Burger King.

403
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,539
I'm going to clean it up.

404
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:07,420
And Auntie Anne's should absolutely be ahead of Arby's for sure, without a doubt.

405
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,220
We're going to sort this.

406
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,019
Just hold on.

407
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:16,099
California Pizza Kitchen I've had once and I don't even remember what it tasted like.

408
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:17,099
I can't rate it.

409
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:18,859
I had it one time.

410
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:20,460
I have no idea.

411
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,259
I have no memory of what it tasted like.

412
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,599
Captain D's.

413
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,460
Charles Jr.

414
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,460
I've never had it.

415
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,059
Charlie's Philly Cheese Steaks.

416
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,170
I think I've had this once.

417
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,589
How many places have I had?

418
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:53,509
You're insane for putting Blaze Pizza above Domino's.

419
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,680
I'm telling you, I'm going to clean this up.

420
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,789
This is just to get it in general location.

421
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,990
OK, a lot of sandwich, hot sandwich places.

422
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,220
I go to local places for this.

423
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,619
I don't go to most chains to get a Philly steak, Philly cheese steak.

424
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:18,859
I go to like a local place.

425
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:20,859
I may have had this once, but not really.

426
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,750
I've not had this at all.

427
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,329
All right, Chick-fil-A is going up here.

428
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:33,940
I don't know.

429
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,660
I think I would rather have Boston Market, although this.

430
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:40,859
OK, here's one thing about.

431
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:45,549
OK, I didn't like that drive through experience.

432
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:49,609
It's good, though.

433
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:57,519
It's like too crowded.

434
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,119
I don't know.

435
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:07,880
And is it too crowded and too obscene to like go get that for how much I think I like it?

436
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,539
We'll see.

437
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,099
It's better.

438
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:15,099
Auntie Anne's is better.

439
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,599
Auntie Anne's is probably should be here.

440
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,829
I was I think I was a little too harsh.

441
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,400
I think it was a little too harsh on Auntie Anne's.

442
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,630
I think so.

443
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,170
Maybe should I put Auntie Anne's up to good?

444
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:32,369
McChicken will always shine brighter.

445
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:34,579
I am going to.

446
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,980
OK, let's just do it now because people are going to fucking freak out.

447
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,579
McDonald's is up here.

448
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,980
I love this place.

449
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
Like, I'm sorry.

450
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:42,980
I do.

451
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,980
I love McDonald's.

452
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,869
People are going to fucking freak out.

453
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:47,470
I know you are.

454
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,019
I know.

455
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,789
I look it's like I like grew up eating McDonald's.

456
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:01,819
It was like like a childhood like memory.

457
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:04,220
The McChicken is so good.

458
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,710
It's so like it brings me back like memories and stuff.

459
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,200
I don't know.

460
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
I love McDonald's.

461
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:15,700
You can call me a fucking disgusting loser all you want.

462
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,269
I actually really do like it.

463
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,670
Look, I don't just put how much I like the food.

464
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:29,920
I put like memories, atmosphere, 500 cars in the drive-through.

465
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:30,519
You know what I mean?

466
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,319
Like I just all comes into my brain.

467
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,880
Right.

468
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:42,809
So when I'm sitting here going seven years old, four piece chicken nuggets,

469
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:51,779
apple slice, not a thousand fucking people at the restaurant screaming at each other.

470
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,819
Good.

471
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,019
Good delicious McChickens, McDoubles, everything.

472
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,660
Oh, yeah. It's up there.

473
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:00,660
Using nostalgia.

474
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
Yeah, I am.

475
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:04,460
It's not about just how good quotes the food is.

476
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,470
There's other things that factor in.

477
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,869
A play place. Yeah.

478
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:13,819
Fuck this.

479
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:20,380
It's going up. No, it's not.

480
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:25,500
You're literally conditioned to like McDonald's.

481
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,700
That's fucking stupid.

482
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,700
Yeah, I remember that comment from last time.

483
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,789
Eat a McDick.

484
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,740
Oh, I remember that one.

485
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:47,769
I knew three years later, two years later, I was going to have to defend this again.

486
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,170
Oh, man.

487
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,779
People are going to be really mad.

488
00:26:51,980 --> 00:27:09,759
I don't think I think this is very overrated, like very, very overrated, but it's better than Arby's.

489
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:17,690
Look, I don't think it's bad,

490
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,420
but I'm telling you right now, there are especially here,

491
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,019
especially in the southwestern United States,

492
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:36,339
there are some incredible local Mexican restaurants that I would rather go to a hundred times over.

493
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:44,240
I find them 10 million times better, in my opinion, and a lot of times they might even be cheaper or the same price.

494
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,609
It's like a thousand times better.

495
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:53,849
If there's a Chipotle like here and across the street is like a local Mexican

496
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,849
like restaurant that serves like authentic Mexican.

497
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,609
I'm going to go here.

498
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:01,809
I'm not going to go here.

499
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:02,609
I'm going to go here.

500
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,539
Chipotle is the definition of sus.

501
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,960
I don't think it's good.

502
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,359
Like I've eaten Chipotle more than a few times.

503
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:23,750
But if it's literally at the bottom of the list, if there's even one decent Mexican restaurant,

504
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:29,579
like a local Mexican restaurant, it's not even it's not even on my mind to even think to go there.

505
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,920
But that doesn't mean the food is bad, right?

506
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:46,900
Like I just it's probably like it's probably like here.

507
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:51,910
Realistically, it's probably here.

508
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:54,480
But no, no, I don't know.

509
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,400
But put CC's in F if you've never been.

510
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,240
I've not had Church's chicken.

511
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,920
CC's pizza.

512
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:16,579
I mean, I haven't had it.

513
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:20,900
So bro, rate Taco Bell.

514
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,099
Cinnabon is so good.

515
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:28,500
But I mean, I haven't had it in a long time.

516
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,680
Cold Stone Creamery.

517
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
Cold Stone is good.

518
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,740
It is.

519
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,980
Cold Stone is really good, isn't it?

520
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,579
But wait, isn't wait, hold on.

521
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:48,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

522
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,180
Cold Stone is the place that doesn't have sizes, right?

523
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,779
It has like I like it.

524
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,579
I love it.

525
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:56,779
I really love you.

526
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,779
Right, right.

527
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,779
Is that what it is?

528
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:03,900
And if you tip, they have to sing a song.

529
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:04,500
No, no.

530
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,700
Let me just give the money to the person.

531
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,700
Like, yeah, this is going down here.

532
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:15,890
No, I just want to I just want to you know,

533
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:20,460
like I just want to like put like fucking cash in an envelope and like tape it

534
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,509
to the fucking back of the door in front of the restaurant and just be like and just fucking leave.

535
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:27,619
You know what I mean?

536
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:29,960
I don't want to be sung to.

537
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,559
I don't like being sung to.

538
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,579
I hate I don't want to be sung to,

539
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,579
especially even like restaurants birthday shit when they come over and like clap.

540
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:37,980
No, please leave me alone.

541
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,779
Please.

542
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,980
I don't even going to give you like a free cupcake.

543
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,579
I don't want it.

544
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:42,940
I do.

545
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,740
Please leave me alone.

546
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,799
I would rather just like have us do a transaction and then be done with it.

547
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,299
I don't want to look around and be like, oh, yeah.

548
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,339
No, because I feel weird.

549
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:57,940
I don't like it.

550
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,779
You placed Arby's above Domino's.

551
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,579
Do you have bad taste buds?

552
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:07,779
Look, it's not done.

553
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,180
I'm just getting everything in the right spot.

554
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,109
My Cold Stone doesn't do that.

555
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:13,109
Did they get rid of it?

556
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:19,819
Wait, I want to read what this person said.

557
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:26,259
If you put KFC low, I'm going to buy you a ticket to Europe so you can see how much better it is here.

558
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,859
I think KFC.

559
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,059
I like KFC.

560
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:35,799
I like Cold Stone's ice cream is good.

561
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,049
Well, I don't like being sung to.

562
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,740
Maybe I'm just a weirdo.

563
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:42,359
It's good.

564
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,559
The ice cream is good.

565
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:47,599
They do like the weird size names.

566
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:51,039
I know like I'm not the first person on the internet to talk about this.

567
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,039
I know everyone has made a comment on this,

568
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,750
but just small, medium, and large.

569
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,150
It's so fucking easy.

570
00:31:59,349 --> 00:31:59,950
It's so simple.

571
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,750
I don't know why we have to like, I don't know.

572
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,589
All right.

573
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:04,430
We'll see.

574
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,210
Cookout.

575
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:08,950
I've never had it.

576
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,940
Culvers.

577
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,940
I think I've heard of this, but I haven't had it.

578
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,339
Dairy Queen.

579
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:31,089
I had a cheeseburger from Dairy Queen one time.

580
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:51,099
I had a cheeseburger from Dairy Queen one time and I'm trying to remember how bad it was.

581
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:52,700
Wait, I gotta put myself back.

582
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,059
Cheese is melted.

583
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:03,589
Okay, it smells good.

584
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,200
I remember waiting.

585
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,799
I remember standing around waiting.

586
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,799
I could smell.

587
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,390
Cheese was melted.

588
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,190
There was crispy lettuce on it.

589
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:19,380
Took a while though.

590
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:20,380
Mmm.

591
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:22,950
I wasn't a fan of their selection.

592
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,150
Okay, I got it.

593
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,319
You're a psycho.

594
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:28,720
What?

595
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,519
I'm just...

596
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,119
I can time travel in my own head.

597
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,450
What do you guys can't do that?

598
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,549
You know that you can time travel?

599
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,859
You can just go back into like your own memories and just time travel back to a different time.

600
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:43,460
Isn't that insane that you can do that?

601
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:54,609
Like I can literally close my eyes and just like be like at some point like in the past.

602
00:33:54,809 --> 00:34:04,220
Jack can't even rotate a cube in their head.

603
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,019
Yeah, people gave me shit for this before.

604
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
It's just a memory.

605
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,619
I know, but isn't a memory...

606
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,420
We've already had this conversation.

607
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:15,000
A memory is like internal time travel.

608
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,800
I like Del Taco a lot.

609
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,389
This is going to be very hard.

610
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,719
You know why I like Del Taco?

611
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,519
Because Del Taco has fries.

612
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,920
That's like kind of cool.

613
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,420
It's like, no, that's pretty cool.

614
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:49,510
Yeah, they have fries.

615
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,300
They have fries.

616
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:59,889
What an American.

617
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,289
As somebody that grew up like in Boston, in the Boston area,

618
00:35:04,489 --> 00:35:10,380
it feels horrible to put this here, but it's fucking awful now.

619
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:11,869
Awful.

620
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:22,199
It sucks because 10 years ago, this would have been like up here, maybe here.

621
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,400
My opinion was solidified on Dunkin' Donuts recently, like within the last year.

622
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:36,199
I had it and it was probably the worst coffee I've ever had in my entire life.

623
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,809
And I remember just taking like a few sips and being like, what the fuck, man?

624
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:47,260
Like what happened?

625
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,380
But what about like Dave's making the donuts?

626
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:54,179
You know what I mean?

627
00:35:54,679 --> 00:36:11,260
The guy with the mustache and he would turn around to the camera with a big tray.

628
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
I remember Dave from Dunkin' Donuts.

629
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:15,460
It was like he was supposed to be like the owner.

630
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:18,260
He like owned the restaurant and he made the donuts.

631
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:27,030
It was like, it's me, Dave from Dunkin' Donuts.

632
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,630
That's the only reason why it's up here.

633
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,489
But it's just it's not.

634
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,519
In my personal opinion, it's just not.

635
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,719
It's not very good.

636
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,920
And I remember maybe it was it always bad?

637
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,519
I don't know.

638
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,340
I remember like at least five to ten years ago.

639
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,139
It was like, holy shit, a blueberry iced coffee.

640
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,940
But you know, you guys have seen me drink this shit on camera.

641
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,170
Oh, blueberry iced coffee.

642
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,570
It was like a joke on the channel like five, six years ago.

643
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,280
I don't know what happened.

644
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:55,659
I don't like it anymore.

645
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,519
But holy shit, the blueberry iced coffee from Dunkin' Donuts was the best thing I ever drank.

646
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:09,449
Denny's gets points because it's never closed ever in like the history of the human race.

647
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,820
Like that's the only reason why they get points.

648
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:20,539
But like Galileo was going to Denny's and like they never closed

649
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:21,940
and they've always been open since then.

650
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,320
So it belongs up and like it's OK.

651
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:27,920
I like it. It's all right.

652
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,019
Dunkin' is of all franchises.

653
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,820
I'm sure it's total shit on the West Coast.

654
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:49,619
It's still fire on the East Coast, I promise.

655
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,750
But I have this opinion, OK?

656
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,320
If you have a good product and it's really good and people love it,

657
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,130
you need to make sure that that product is good everywhere.

658
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:06,130
You cannot have your name on a product and just blow it over

659
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:09,530
and just over expand to a point where the product is not the same product.

660
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,730
Like it's a worse product.

661
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,230
If you have that good product, it's got to be good everywhere.

662
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,110
Like if I go to the East Coast and get a blueberry iced coffee and I go,

663
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,309
holy shit, this is incredible.

664
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,670
What the fuck am I drinking over here?

665
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:27,869
You know what I mean?

666
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,250
That's why.

667
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:30,849
Is it even Dunkin' Donuts?

668
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,570
Does it have to be called something else?

669
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,800
Dave works at every store.

670
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,820
They can't control every one of them.

671
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:54,699
I'm just saying I've been to at least three or four separate locations

672
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,820
of Dunkin' Donuts in the last like three or four years.

673
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,099
And it's not it's I have been personally thought it was not very good each time.

674
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,500
These are good, but I have not had it enough.

675
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,480
Eat a Dunkin'

676
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,440
whatever time that person out for like five minutes.

677
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,099
What the fuck? OK.

678
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:38,289
Uh, yeah, I remember this place being pretty good.

679
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,769
I've still not had this.

680
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,300
OK, I'm going to put this up here because I want I want this.

681
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,260
I see it. It's everywhere.

682
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,139
I want this.

683
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:50,929
I need to have this.

684
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,960
I've never I've not had El Pollo Loco.

685
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:59,610
Not yet. It's OK.

686
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,059
We have it in. Yeah, I heard it's good.

687
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,900
I heard it's like because they give you

688
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,730
it's like a chicken drumstick and like sides.

689
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,449
It's like it's like I'm not it's like fast food, but it's not right.

690
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:17,730
It's like a KFC if there wasn't like breading on the chicken.

691
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,929
Right. But do I have that correct?

692
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:24,880
It's pretty healthy.

693
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:28,730
Yeah, I want to try it.

694
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,489
I've seen a thousand of these locations and I'm just like, fuck,

695
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:33,929
I want to have it one day.

696
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:37,489
But this falls into the same category.

697
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:43,570
The problem that I have, like eating chipotle, right, is like El Pollo Loco

698
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:48,980
will be there and I'm like, oh, El Pollo Loco local Mexican restaurant right here.

699
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:50,139
Yeah, that's where I'm going.

700
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,820
I it's tough for me to do.

701
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:56,179
Mexican food is my number one, probably at least one or two favorite food

702
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,579
in the world, so I like always don't have an opportunity to go here

703
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,900
because if I if I'm like, I want to try El Pollo Loco,

704
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:07,380
that place has a burrito that's fucking incredible.

705
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,860
And it's the best burrito I've had in like my whole life.

706
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,420
I like it's hard for me to go there to El Pollo Loco.

707
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,309
All right. Fat burger.

708
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:22,099
I don't have I have I had this baby.

709
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,579
Why do I remember this for some reason?

710
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,829
Maybe I've had it like once.

711
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,769
This logo is familiar and I like I remember

712
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:42,050
the logo and I remember like it tasting good.

713
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,519
I'm going to put it here for now.

714
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,480
This has to move.

715
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,920
I'll fix this in a minute. Don't worry.

716
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:56,510
I've done I've not had Zoli's.

717
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:00,349
I'm going to purpose going to be gross.

718
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,489
No, I didn't.

719
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,489
OK. Firehouse subs is good.

720
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,730
Hmm.

721
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:20,219
Although I like Firehouse subs,

722
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,099
but I feel like they're this selection is a little limited for me.

723
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,429
They have like a handful of like their specialty sandwiches.

724
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:38,619
But again, I would not go to Firehouse if I could go like, you know,

725
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,260
Frank Pizza's Pizzeria and it's like fucking great.

726
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,659
And it's like subs and shit and pizza like, I don't know.

727
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,849
I actually genuinely think it's better than.

728
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,239
Yeah, we'll have to go through this again.

729
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:57,829
Five Guys is really good.

730
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,599
It is.

731
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,079
But their fries are total absolute ass.

732
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:16,369
I know people think that's a weird opinion, but I think the fries are fucking awful.

733
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:21,980
Their burgers are amazing.

734
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:33,920
I'm going to. OK, the perfect French fry to me.

735
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,599
And you guys all know what I'm talking about.

736
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,320
And maybe, OK, whatever your opinion on me after this is how you're going to have

737
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,940
the opinion, right? French fry.

738
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,539
I like the I like the orange French fries that are crunchy on the outside.

739
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:50,099
And they're a little bit long and thicker.

740
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,300
They're like crunchy and they're orange.

741
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:54,650
You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.

742
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,329
They're like a dark orange color.

743
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,409
They're like crunch.

744
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,409
And there's like it's they're crunchy and they have like this potato in the middle.

745
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,260
Not a carrot. I'm not eating carrots.

746
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:07,659
Not sweet potato.

747
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:13,829
It's like from takeout restaurants, the dark orange long French fry.

748
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:16,829
Not a wedge, no.

749
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,099
I know that some people know exactly what I'm talking about.

750
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,340
It's like that either.

751
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:27,699
Yeah, it'll be like orange.

752
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,500
I don't like French.

753
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:38,199
OK, this is how many times I said, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

754
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,559
How many times? Listen, OK, OK.

755
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:48,489
I know that French fries are potatoes that you just julienne them

756
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,809
and you put them in some oil and that's a that's a French fry.

757
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,360
Right. But I don't like potato French fries.

758
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:02,219
I like my French fries to be crispy on the outside with like a good crunch,

759
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:04,019
with some of that like potato in the middle.

760
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:12,019
You're insane.

761
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:18,090
He doesn't know what you julienne julienne slice.

762
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,630
You guys don't know how you guys don't know what that means.

763
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:30,280
They're too mushy. Yeah, they're chefs in chat.

764
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,199
What's going on here?

765
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,230
Does he know that he's on stream?

766
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:40,340
All right. For a second, I thought I had like a electrode on my temple

767
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,789
because this I just like glanced over here, like at the preview.

768
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:48,610
So you're here and the preview is here.

769
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:54,969
I just looked over here and was like, what the fuck is attached to my head?

770
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:02,019
Am I like what am I connected to?

771
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:03,219
Electrode.

772
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:14,079
OK, it's been a very long time since I've even seen a Friendlies,

773
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,980
but I remember it being in the same tier as like Denny's.

774
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:28,190
But they had this thing called a Jubilee roll at Friendlies.

775
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,039
And it was this ice cream roll that had like frosting on top.

776
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:34,199
And you had to cut it.

777
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,639
It was like ice cream roll.

778
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:44,039
It puts it ahead, puts it ahead.

779
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,409
Arby's has mozzarella sticks.

780
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:54,139
Sorry, I came here to defend Arby's.

781
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,019
I gave my opinion on Arby's.

782
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:02,519
I if I want a like turkey sandwich, like deli sliced, like roast beef sandwich,

783
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,559
I just can get that at the deli at the I can make it literally from the fridge.

784
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:08,960
That's not to say it's bad.

785
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:23,570
Arby's defenders exist of Fuddruckers.

786
00:47:23,769 --> 00:47:28,269
I've had it. It was good, but not good enough for me to remember and go.

787
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:33,769
Oh, yeah, I feel like it was better than this, though.

788
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,920
Brash green burrito.

789
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,690
I've never had it.

790
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:45,929
Hardee's and Carl's Jr.

791
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,090
This is like the correct me if I'm wrong, but Carl's Jr.

792
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:52,889
or Hardee's is just a League of Legends skin of Carl's Jr.

793
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:57,280
Right. I've not had either one of them.

794
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:08,039
Harvey's, Uddlehouse, IHOP is kind of in the Denny's tier.

795
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:10,289
It's just always open.

796
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,579
But I think I would rather go to Denny's.

797
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:29,309
Oh, certainly alarm off.

798
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:35,269
Oh, shit, there's a lot of new viewers.

799
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:37,829
There are a lot of new people here.

800
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:49,289
Oh, how many people are here?

801
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,329
I think the average concurrent viewers

802
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:55,010
that I have when I did this last time was probably like 4000.

803
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,340
There's a shitload of new people that probably love this place.

804
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,809
And I'm about to literally just I'm about

805
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:05,170
to literally just fucking make you probably leave the channel.

806
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,269
What do I say to them? OK.

807
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:29,590
In and out is good, but I put it in the same category as no, that's not fair.

808
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,630
I was going to say Chipotle. That's unfair.

809
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,829
It's way better than Chipotle.

810
00:49:32,829 --> 00:49:35,230
And I like it. I would rather go there than Chipotle.

811
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:43,170
It's good, but it's not so good that I would.

812
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:44,650
It's not S tier.

813
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:54,349
I have a problem with the secret menu in a lot of these places.

814
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,469
I have to this like 10000 plus more people here than we're last time.

815
00:49:57,469 --> 00:49:59,510
I have to tell I have to tell them about this.

816
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,300
Dick, they have a menu and then they have this secret menu.

817
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,300
But like, who fucking cares?

818
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,820
Why is it even on? Why?

819
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:13,900
Just put it on the menu and wrap the burgers.

820
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,699
I don't want like

821
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,460
like half open and it's like in a bag that I got like through the drive through.

822
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:23,119
It's not a secret anymore.

823
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,440
Animal style fries.

824
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,480
It's not like, oh, quiet.

825
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,460
Hey, I think I'll order that burger animal style.

826
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,519
Whoa, what?

827
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,849
What do you say, Stu?

828
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:37,610
Don't fucking say that so loud.

829
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:40,050
What's wrong with you? Don't say that so loud.

830
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:42,840
Just put it on the menu.

831
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:49,690
Wait, wait a minute.

832
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,940
I was told that in and out.

833
00:50:55,659 --> 00:50:56,940
This is another problem I have with it.

834
00:50:57,139 --> 00:50:59,139
OK, big problem I have with in and out.

835
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:04,210
I ordered in and out the way I am supposed to order the burger, right?

836
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:06,059
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

837
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:08,699
You can't just go to in and out and order the burger on the menu.

838
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,619
Nope. You've got to do animal style with

839
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,460
grilled onions and make sure that they put it in a to go box.

840
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,400
Just why do I have to order this thing

841
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,679
so special to make it taste the way that it's supposed to be?

842
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:23,190
Like every time you talk to somebody that loves in and out, they tell you,

843
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,869
don't order fucking anything off the menu.

844
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:25,829
You have to change everything.

845
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:34,860
But I'll tell you, I ordered a burger with the grilled onions in it,

846
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:39,380
take out box and I sat there and I ate it and I said, holy shit,

847
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:44,699
this is fucking really, really good, way better than the default burger

848
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:47,559
that you just order off the menu, way better.

849
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,019
And I mean, like, probably like a hundred times better.

850
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,079
So I'm going to.

851
00:51:57,219 --> 00:51:58,099
OK, you ready?

852
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,699
In and out is going up here.

853
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:08,650
But then it's being it's being like it's being like changed, right?

854
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,010
Like it's up here. Then it comes down here.

855
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,070
This is like the hold on.

856
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:15,550
This is this is fucked up.

857
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,260
Like this can't be here. Neither can this.

858
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:27,469
Neither can that. Your pressure chain.

859
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:32,429
No, I'm just telling you that I I finally ate in and out the way that I was told

860
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:37,179
I was supposed to quote order special the burger and it was better than just

861
00:52:37,179 --> 00:52:42,699
ordering it off the menu, which makes me want to put it down here.

862
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:47,980
Even animal style dick.

863
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,340
And this is another place that's fucking crowded all the time.

864
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:15,059
It's just like, look, if I'm hungry and I want

865
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:20,510
like a quick burger or something like time to go sit in an in and out like 10

866
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:24,269
to 15 minutes, sometimes that line is like as the same as like Chick-fil-A.

867
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:34,219
I want to make this clear.

868
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,579
I don't think in and out is bad.

869
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,780
I think it's good.

870
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:46,380
But the process to get it to be good is a little irritating to me and wrap the

871
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,420
burgers up like every fucking other restaurant does.

872
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:50,539
Every other restaurant does this.

873
00:53:50,739 --> 00:53:53,300
If it was like one or two other places did this, it's fine.

874
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:57,980
Every single fast food burger place does not have your burger.

875
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:01,380
Out in the open in the bag to wrap the burger up.

876
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,179
I don't care what I don't care.

877
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:04,340
Just please put it in a wrapper.

878
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,780
Let me wrap it and put it in the bag, please.

879
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,420
Fuck out of here.

880
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:20,010
Jack in the box.

881
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,090
Why is in and out before McDonald's?

882
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:26,369
Because that's where it is.

883
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,849
If you want a wrapper, you ask for the takeout box.

884
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:41,300
If you're driving in your car and they give you a cardboard box,

885
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,780
that's like this cardboard fucking shoe box that you're supposed to.

886
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,460
I want a bag.

887
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,400
I don't want like this cardboard box that like somebody has to fucking hold like this.

888
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:53,519
I want a bag.

889
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:54,880
Put it in a bag and wrap it.

890
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:07,940
It's a box in a bag.

891
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:14,900
Why don't you just put it in a bag?

892
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:27,269
Like Joe McDonald figured this out in like 1910 or whatever the fuck this was.

893
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:30,829
He figured this out in like the fucking 1800s.

894
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,670
When McDonald's opened for the first time,

895
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:36,190
you just like wrap it in a little bit of paper and you give it to the customer.

896
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,440
I'm not going to stay on this.

897
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:40,920
Just know I like the taste.

898
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,840
I think it's fucking good.

899
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:53,559
But I have but but but but the Simpsons.

900
00:55:55,019 --> 00:56:02,369
Wait, did we do this already? Hold on.

901
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,769
Sim I'm freaking out.

902
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:08,070
Simpsons intro.

903
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:13,550
Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't.

904
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:17,570
I'm done.

905
00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:19,050
Don't don't don't.

906
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:24,989
I'm loving it. That's weird.

907
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:30,900
What is Jack's? Is Jack's not Jack in the Box?

908
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,449
Oh, is this the same?

909
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:47,039
You can see the insanity in his eyes.

910
00:56:55,539 --> 00:56:57,179
Why do you like your burger mushed to shit?

911
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:06,010
I just I OK, if I eat in the restaurant in and out, I I need to be fair.

912
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:10,730
I cannot remember the last time that I

913
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:13,969
went into a fast food restaurant to sit down and eat there.

914
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:17,530
It's been I can't even remember when I did that last.

915
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,860
I knew I was going to have to defend this to the new viewers here.

916
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:34,320
Hey, Paul, I don't this is not Jack in the Box.

917
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,159
I don't know what it is.

918
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,469
I've never had Jamba Juice.

919
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:43,789
No, Jason's Deli is just Panera Bread with a different name.

920
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:50,420
I mean, that's just kind of how I see it.

921
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,110
Jason's Deli is for men.

922
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:08,449
What do you mean it's for men?

923
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,659
What is like is like the number one at

924
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:17,619
Jason's Deli like a steak sandwich with a beer and it comes with a free lawnmower

925
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,340
coupon. What do you mean for men?

926
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,769
Does it come with like aftershave?

927
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:32,519
What are you talking about? It comes.

928
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,139
I've had it before.

929
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,059
It's I thought it was good.

930
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:45,739
I thought I mean, I don't know if I'd put it like up into like our coveted in and out here.

931
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:53,369
And I don't know if I'd rather probably just go to OK.

932
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,940
I ate at a restaurant. Is this weird?

933
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:02,820
This is kind of a completely off topic story.

934
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,630
I ate at I feel like people like I don't know.

935
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:10,300
I ate at a restaurant one time and then I walked.

936
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:16,099
I finished my full meal at this restaurant and there was a Baskin Robbins right next

937
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:18,860
to it connected to this place, connected to the restaurant.

938
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,880
And I walked out of the restaurant.

939
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:24,719
I had a full meal. I was full.

940
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,239
It was a lot of food. Right.

941
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,219
And I walked out and like in to the Baskin Robbins.

942
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,019
And like I felt like it was I don't know.

943
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:34,219
Something was weird about it.

944
00:59:35,429 --> 00:59:39,030
Like I walked out and then in and they came up with a big ice cream.

945
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:41,269
And I don't know. I feel like the workers are probably just like,

946
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:43,909
holy shit, this guy's fucking hungry.

947
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,050
This dude got like a large big ice cream.

948
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,929
He just had like a full dinner.

949
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,320
He had the munchies.

950
00:59:57,519 --> 00:59:58,880
But it was I don't know.

951
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:01,000
Because it was immediately after I finished.

952
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,380
It was like, thank you.

953
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:05,780
Now, that was great. Thank you.

954
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:13,519
In the other door,

955
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:16,239
Jersey Mike's or what I like to call this place,

956
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,360
Oregano Mike's, because it's on every sandwich.

957
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:22,260
I actually not that big of a fan of this place.

958
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:33,099
It's good.

959
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,739
It's just Oregano Subway.

960
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,949
Yeah, I definitely I was definitely better than like fucking.

961
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,869
It's probably better than Arby's.

962
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,050
I had a turkey sandwich from this place

963
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:00,500
before, and it was like, that was fine.

964
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,380
It was just too much oregano on it.

965
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:06,320
I think I ordered it the wrong way.

966
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:09,019
It was fine.

967
01:01:09,219 --> 01:01:12,909
Not like, oh, wow.

968
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:18,500
I would probably rather go to Firehouse than Jersey Mike's.

969
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:19,659
Jimmy John's.

970
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:30,199
These are just the same place in my brain.

971
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,119
I cannot distinguish between the two of these in my head,

972
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:42,199
but I should be able to. Right.

973
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:51,500
I feel like if I have to remember like the few times I've had both of these,

974
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:53,340
I don't know. I just don't know.

975
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,019
Johnny Rockets. Oh, man.

976
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:07,980
I got boogers coming out of my nose, I think.

977
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,900
Just be aware.

978
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,119
Johnny Rockets is good.

979
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,619
But how good? That's the question.

980
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:22,420
Keep in mind, I ate at this restaurant last time.

981
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:26,239
I ate at it. I was probably 11.

982
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,059
So I don't know how much of an opinion I can form here.

983
01:02:39,699 --> 01:02:45,110
Eat your boogers, booger boy.

984
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:49,159
I cannot speak to it.

985
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:53,880
And unfortunately, if I haven't had it in over 10 plus years, it has to go down here.

986
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,719
It just does.

987
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,219
Jollibee is a really interesting place.

988
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,099
Jollibee is one of the only like fast food restaurants that has like fucking

989
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,539
spaghetti. It was like, holy shit, what?

990
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:19,269
I've had it a couple of times and I like it.

991
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,260
That doesn't mean it's good.

992
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,340
Well, now, why am I? I'm too bright now.

993
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:31,260
What happened here?

994
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:47,699
OK, um, I don't remember being like, holy shit, this is good.

995
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,860
Five guys should not be here and neither should Chick-fil-A.

996
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,559
McDonald's should be here.

997
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,559
Oh, my God, German.

998
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,079
Oh, my God, based.

999
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,079
Yeah, thanks.

1000
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,679
Was that one guy in the chat that said

1001
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,119
that he was going to be mad if I did this?

1002
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:13,099
I like this place.

1003
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,420
You know, it sucks about KFC.

1004
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:21,610
Doesn't it suck being the only person in the group of your group of friends that

1005
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:25,090
recommends this place and wants to go, but nobody else does ever.

1006
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:30,829
What do you want to get for food, guys?

1007
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,349
Oh, you know, let's think about it.

1008
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:34,429
KFC is around.

1009
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:36,789
There's a KFC. We could go to KFC.

1010
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:39,849
No, no, yeah, we could.

1011
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:41,050
But we could go here. We could go here.

1012
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,570
OK, we're not going.

1013
01:04:42,769 --> 01:04:46,250
It's like I feel like I'm the only person that ever recommends to ever go here.

1014
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,000
Like ever in all my groups I've ever been in.

1015
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:53,369
So I don't get to have it that often because it's like it's hard.

1016
01:04:53,570 --> 01:05:00,440
OK, when I think of going to KFC, I think of you get like all the sides.

1017
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:02,079
You get the bucket of chicken.

1018
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,320
You get all the biscuits.

1019
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:07,800
I don't really would want to go to KFC to order like just one little thing.

1020
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,039
I only want to go to KFC if I get like the whole spread.

1021
01:05:18,369 --> 01:05:19,090
But I like it.

1022
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:20,409
I do.

1023
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:24,300
Their mashed potatoes are great.

1024
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,900
Their macaroni and cheese is awesome.

1025
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:29,219
The corn, I love that watery ass corn, don't you?

1026
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,940
God, I love it.

1027
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,699
I try to deliberately get the water in my mouth.

1028
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:36,820
I deliberately try to get like the liquid.

1029
01:05:37,389 --> 01:05:38,349
Oh, I love it.

1030
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,559
I'm sitting here thinking about like that watery ass corn.

1031
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,719
And I want it up here.

1032
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,800
But this is like just kind of like I haven't eaten today.

1033
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,019
I've not eaten.

1034
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:57,300
So right now you are this.

1035
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,500
I'm just realizing what's going on.

1036
01:06:00,019 --> 01:06:02,940
I'm rating these based on what I want like tonight for dinner.

1037
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:04,260
Not about how good they are.

1038
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,219
I want that fucking watery corn tonight.

1039
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,489
So that's happening.

1040
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:19,949
OK, Krispy Kreme.

1041
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,230
I mean, this is like the meme.

1042
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,159
It's good.

1043
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,179
I mean, it's good.

1044
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,739
How good, though?

1045
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:39,900
I remember biting into a Krispy Kreme donut and before I could chew, it was gone.

1046
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,380
And I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

1047
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,960
It was like it's like a cotton candy of donuts.

1048
01:06:51,619 --> 01:06:52,619
It's just gone.

1049
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:06,730
This is kind of unfair, though, because Krispy Kreme just does one like meme

1050
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:10,010
thing where it's like the Krispy Kreme, delicious, yummy Krispy Kreme, sugary

1051
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,289
melts in your mouth donut.

1052
01:07:11,289 --> 01:07:14,730
But I would I'm not going to go to Krispy Kreme instead of firehouse subs.

1053
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:16,130
It's a different world.

1054
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:24,440
I'm going to keep it here for now.

1055
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:26,460
I've never had this.

1056
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,880
I am I haven't had this in probably since I was probably like 12.

1057
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,780
But I but I like the little guy.

1058
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,380
So he's going up here.

1059
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:38,300
I've not had long drawn silvers.

1060
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,780
I've never had Marcos.

1061
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:45,309
I've never had the Callister's mod.

1062
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:52,030
Mo's Mo's is Mo's is fucking good.

1063
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:56,369
Mo's is way better, way better.

1064
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,090
But it's been a long time.

1065
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:01,230
Mo's is better than Chipotle.

1066
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,519
It is. It's far better.

1067
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:04,719
It's far superior.

1068
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,539
I mean, my face, why am I so blown out?

1069
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:12,900
Where's this light coming from?

1070
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:23,859
Heavily disagree.

1071
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:29,100
You know, I honestly, if you think Mo's is better than Chipotle, like that to me,

1072
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:34,989
to hear somebody say that to me, that's like, oh, OK, you and I are on the same

1073
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:40,890
page based like that's my based for me.

1074
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:43,329
If you say Chipotle is better than Mo's,

1075
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:46,939
it's like, oh, you and I are not going to get along.

1076
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,720
We're just not at all.

1077
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,800
I mean, we may just delete my number from your phone.

1078
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,920
Like, we're not going to hang up.

1079
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:01,960
I keep saying based.

1080
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,039
I don't know why it's just like it's in the brain now.

1081
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:10,489
Oh, I know why it's because the light's not on in this room.

1082
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,680
I was wondering, like, why does it look so weird in here?

1083
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:25,560
I'm sitting kind of in like a dark room and I didn't realize it.

1084
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,079
Now it looks like normal.

1085
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,399
OK, that was weird.

1086
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,329
There we go. OK, what are you guys saying?

1087
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:50,699
Noodles and Express.

1088
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:52,060
Wait, what did I just put up?

1089
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,100
I put something. Where did what was it? Oh, Little Caesars.

1090
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:59,539
OK, Panda Express is hard.

1091
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,739
This is not Panda Express.

1092
01:10:05,739 --> 01:10:12,380
Anyways, it is. What else?

1093
01:10:12,579 --> 01:10:14,819
Yeah. What are you talking about?

1094
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,029
There's another panda.

1095
01:10:19,819 --> 01:10:21,659
Stop ignoring us. What are you talking about?

1096
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:28,909
I don't think I've I think I ate.

1097
01:10:29,109 --> 01:10:30,750
I tried it off somebody's plate.

1098
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:33,229
Somebody ordered it and I was like, oh, I'll try it.

1099
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,079
I ate like one piece of chicken, but that I've not I've never really eaten it.

1100
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:43,029
I haven't. Did you forget about the phenomenal tier?

1101
01:10:43,029 --> 01:10:45,159
No, I just need to make sure that stuff

1102
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:47,720
that goes up there is stuff that I absolutely am certain of.

1103
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,239
And then some of those might move.

1104
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:53,960
So we're going to move a lot of the shit around this Panera.

1105
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,840
There is. All right.

1106
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,279
I do like cheddar broccoli soup and a bread bowl.

1107
01:11:03,939 --> 01:11:07,539
As much as people want to talk about Panera, you got to remember something.

1108
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:12,289
Panera was like the first restaurant to really do shit like that.

1109
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,420
Wait, I can get like soup and a bread bowl.

1110
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,939
Like nobody did that shit like 10, 20 years ago.

1111
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,920
So they kind of paved the way for a lot

1112
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:34,520
of these restaurants that you see now. It's hospital food.

1113
01:11:37,329 --> 01:11:44,109
If you really think that friendlies is better, like what is friendlies then?

1114
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:56,449
What would you consider friendlies to be in this scenario? Quality.

1115
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:00,619
OK, it's all right.

1116
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:01,619
It's better. I'll fix it.

1117
01:12:01,619 --> 01:12:03,579
But it's I don't think it's like great. I think it's good.

1118
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:07,479
I've had it a bunch of times. Papa John's.

1119
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,039
I think I've had once.

1120
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,979
I think about it one time.

1121
01:12:16,189 --> 01:12:20,810
I don't like I haven't like had it.

1122
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:24,369
I don't I don't really order from very many pizza chains.

1123
01:12:24,369 --> 01:12:27,649
Like I said before, if there's a local place that I would get it.

1124
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,239
So it's not even on the list.

1125
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,300
I don't eat it off of Papa Murphy.

1126
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:46,100
East Coast subs, Peter Pitt Pizza Hut goes way up here because it has the stuff

1127
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:50,819
crust and everybody, all these all these other pretenders that did stuff crust.

1128
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:52,829
It's not even remotely the same.

1129
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,180
It's not even fucking close.

1130
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:57,689
Stuff crust pizza from Pizza Hut.

1131
01:12:57,689 --> 01:12:59,170
I don't know what they put in that crust.

1132
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:00,090
I don't know what they do to it.

1133
01:13:00,979 --> 01:13:03,319
I love it. I love it so much.

1134
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:05,960
And other people have tried to imitate and it's just not even close.

1135
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,869
But it should be up here.

1136
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,699
The only thing I order at the whole restaurant, nothing else.

1137
01:13:21,739 --> 01:13:23,739
You're tripping. Pizza Hut is garbage.

1138
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:26,979
Have you had the stuff crust pizza?

1139
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:29,220
Have you had a stuff crust pepperoni pizza from Pizza Hut?

1140
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:31,340
I understand your concerns here.

1141
01:13:31,899 --> 01:13:34,579
Have you ever gone, I know, like, oh, I had a pizza at Pizza Hut.

1142
01:13:34,779 --> 01:13:35,920
It sucked. Yes.

1143
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:37,079
Answer my question.

1144
01:13:37,649 --> 01:13:41,970
Have you ever had a stuffed crust pizza from Pizza Hut?

1145
01:13:42,979 --> 01:13:47,000
If you have not, you need to rethink it a little bit.

1146
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:55,130
Even if you hate Pizza Hut, it's the only thing that is on the menu that I order.

1147
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:58,590
It's just like Taco Bell and Taco Bell.

1148
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:01,310
Let's just put it up there because I'm going to.

1149
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:02,710
Right. Like, let's just do it.

1150
01:14:02,909 --> 01:14:06,350
Let's do it now because this is where it belongs.

1151
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:13,659
The Cheesy Gordita Crunch is the single best menu item on any fast food

1152
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,859
restaurant that has ever come out across every country on earth.

1153
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:25,140
Everything else at Taco Bell can suck, can be disgusting and worthless.

1154
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,180
It does not matter.

1155
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,579
It doesn't fucking matter.

1156
01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:28,539
It doesn't matter.

1157
01:14:29,109 --> 01:14:32,590
Cheesy Gordita Crunch puts this up here just on its own.

1158
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:36,810
It carries the whole rest of the team, the entire team.

1159
01:14:39,489 --> 01:14:44,739
The Cheesy Gordita Crunch scored like a hundred points in the basketball game.

1160
01:14:44,739 --> 01:14:47,060
And everybody else on the team was sleeping on the court.

1161
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:49,859
They still won the game, didn't they?

1162
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:59,010
Doesn't matter. It has to be there.

1163
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:07,210
Quidditch and team fucking Gryffindor won that match.

1164
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:15,189
Quidditch. Taco Bell, I fucking love this place.

1165
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,659
There are times when I know I've eaten

1166
01:15:18,859 --> 01:15:24,390
Taco Bell yesterday and I sit there and I go, fuck it, I'm doing it again.

1167
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:33,970
Doesn't happen that often, but it is the only place that I will reliably say I

1168
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:37,289
would eat that instead of the local Mexican restaurants.

1169
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:38,579
It's the only one.

1170
01:15:39,979 --> 01:15:41,500
It's the only exception.

1171
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:48,680
Local Mexican restaurants are so good and you put Taco Bell up in S tier.

1172
01:15:49,140 --> 01:16:00,289
I have very, very specific reasons why, though, very specific that oh, especially

1173
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,770
holy shit, if you get the Doritos taco, if you get the

1174
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:07,449
you want to talk about this shit goes up, this shit goes into the stratosphere.

1175
01:16:07,649 --> 01:16:08,970
This is like aliens.

1176
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:10,449
Aliens wouldn't even see this.

1177
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:12,329
It's going to go so high into the goddamn cosmos.

1178
01:16:12,529 --> 01:16:16,329
If you put the Doritos Locos Taco in the Cheesy Gordita Crunch,

1179
01:16:17,789 --> 01:16:19,869
it can't even be on the list anymore. It'd be gone.

1180
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:23,159
You would think I removed it. In fact, we should take it off.

1181
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,770
I haven't had it ever.

1182
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,050
And I always say I want it.

1183
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:35,569
I say I always want it.

1184
01:16:35,569 --> 01:16:36,890
I always say I want it.

1185
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,260
But I've never gotten it. I've never eaten it.

1186
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:47,970
And I really do feel like if I had if I did eat it, that it would probably be up here.

1187
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:50,890
I've seen like I've seen other people eat it.

1188
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:52,489
I've seen like commercials.

1189
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:54,649
I'm just like, holy shit, that's right up my alley.

1190
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,560
I've never eaten it.

1191
01:16:57,699 --> 01:16:58,979
They have the fries you like.

1192
01:16:59,180 --> 01:16:59,819
Are you serious?

1193
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:07,529
Wait a minute. Explain it to me.

1194
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:09,729
What are the fries like it?

1195
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:21,810
Are you kidding me?

1196
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:25,850
Are these the fries that are these the actual fries that I like?

1197
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:27,710
Oh, my God, they are, aren't they?

1198
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,479
I mean, this night I'm going to get it tonight.

1199
01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:41,859
Yeah, I Popeye's fries and go to images.

1200
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,680
Holy shit.

1201
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,840
This is exactly what I want.

1202
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:46,239
This is the exact thing.

1203
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:50,039
The orange French fry and they're crunchy and they're crispy.

1204
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:52,510
Holy shit.

1205
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,390
This is precisely what I want.

1206
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,600
All right. This is going up. This is going up here.

1207
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,000
I don't even care if I've ever eaten it.

1208
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:02,279
It's going up here because like it just has the it has the absolute best French fry

1209
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:03,640
you could possibly want. It's going up there.

1210
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,239
I don't even I know what those taste like.

1211
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:06,199
I can put it up here.

1212
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,079
Holy shit. It's unbelievable.

1213
01:18:19,539 --> 01:18:20,340
Let me show you.

1214
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:32,789
So you hear this is what I was talking about.

1215
01:18:38,029 --> 01:18:38,510
Where is it?

1216
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,659
That is exactly what I want.

1217
01:18:53,409 --> 01:18:54,569
I know what they taste like.

1218
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:02,989
Is it where I know the exact sound that those make, too.

1219
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:05,140
It's like

1220
01:19:08,779 --> 01:19:12,930
Popeye's is going up here because I know what those taste like.

1221
01:19:16,569 --> 01:19:17,250
Let's continue.

1222
01:19:19,159 --> 01:19:22,970
We're for two lows hot belly.

1223
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:27,010
I think I've only I've only had to do it once.

1224
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,239
This nose.

1225
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:32,920
Oh, man, the honey bacon club from Quiznos puts this up here.

1226
01:19:34,189 --> 01:19:36,989
But it's I have not had it in a long time.

1227
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,960
They even have this quiz nose.

1228
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:52,859
Did Quiznos go to business about moving McDonald's?

1229
01:19:52,859 --> 01:19:53,899
It's it's dynamic.

1230
01:19:53,899 --> 01:19:54,699
It's going to be moving around.

1231
01:19:54,699 --> 01:19:56,100
I have to make sure it's in the right place.

1232
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:58,500
Quiznos is bankrupt.

1233
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:03,800
What a fucking unfair world.

1234
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,119
What an unfair world that Quiznos has to go away.

1235
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:12,159
But Subway continues to be on every other street corner.

1236
01:20:12,859 --> 01:20:13,899
What world are we in?

1237
01:20:15,619 --> 01:20:18,500
Why? That seems so unbelievably unfair.

1238
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,380
And because of that, it's going up and asked here.

1239
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:22,399
That's I can't believe it.

1240
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:24,399
That place is incredible.

1241
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:27,079
It was the best fast food sub place I've ever had.

1242
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:32,340
What happened?

1243
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:38,729
Canes, Canes is very, very good.

1244
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,039
Canes is very good.

1245
01:20:41,739 --> 01:20:44,020
And Canes, in fact, is probably going up here.

1246
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:00,789
I would absolutely rather have Canes than anything on this list.

1247
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:03,210
Yeah, I think so.

1248
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,539
It might even level up here.

1249
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:08,739
It's possible.

1250
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:12,500
Canes is the best fast food restaurant.

1251
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,899
Well, it's one of them because it's obviously top four right now.

1252
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:21,859
I can't Boston Market cannot be in my top five favorite fast food restaurants.

1253
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:24,380
I haven't had it in like fucking 10 years.

1254
01:21:24,819 --> 01:21:26,140
It's going because of that reason.

1255
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:26,979
It's going down here.

1256
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,460
It gets hometown advantage.

1257
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:43,699
Yeah, I can't know.

1258
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:48,020
Reader Rita's Roy Rogers.

1259
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,500
I just know the drink Roy Rogers.

1260
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,460
I've never eaten there.

1261
01:21:50,899 --> 01:21:51,579
So borrows.

1262
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:54,340
This is the pizza that you see at every airport and every mall.

1263
01:21:54,539 --> 01:21:56,850
It's OK. I think it's all right.

1264
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:58,489
I would say it's better than Pizza Hut.

1265
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,199
We'll see.

1266
01:22:07,619 --> 01:22:08,340
Shake Shack.

1267
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:13,539
I remember Shake Shack was in S tier the last time I did this.

1268
01:22:13,579 --> 01:22:15,300
I said Shake Shack was the best burger

1269
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,859
of any restaurant like fast food or other that I've had.

1270
01:22:19,779 --> 01:22:24,609
But I need to I need to update it and update it.

1271
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,239
This is dropped for me.

1272
01:22:30,449 --> 01:22:31,930
It's still very good.

1273
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,619
But the last few times I've had it, something changed.

1274
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:39,510
It was OK.

1275
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:43,390
It was it was very much like, OK, I mean, it was very, very good.

1276
01:22:45,109 --> 01:22:47,909
But something's something's different about it last year or two.

1277
01:22:48,109 --> 01:22:51,119
I don't know. It's dropping.

1278
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:55,590
It came down.

1279
01:22:55,789 --> 01:22:57,979
Sheets never had it.

1280
01:22:59,060 --> 01:22:59,899
Smash Burger.

1281
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:02,220
I want it, but I've never had it.

1282
01:23:02,909 --> 01:23:03,949
Smoothie King.

1283
01:23:04,149 --> 01:23:04,989
I don't think I ever had it.

1284
01:23:05,369 --> 01:23:07,850
Sonic is fucking horrible.

1285
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:08,649
It's horrible.

1286
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:15,260
All the wonderful drinks at Sonic try desperately to push this up here.

1287
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:20,819
But when you eat like for the fifth time in a row, just cold food,

1288
01:23:20,819 --> 01:23:22,539
it's just like no fucking stay down there.

1289
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:29,020
I'm going I'm I'm not kidding.

1290
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:32,819
This is not I'm not trying to say anything bad, but I have to be honest.

1291
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:37,050
I have never had hot food from Sonic.

1292
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:40,050
I've only had it like four or five times, maybe in my life.

1293
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:46,500
It is I have never had food that was even remotely warm from this place ever.

1294
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,079
Not one time.

1295
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,899
It cannot it's not even if the food is good, it's not allowed to be up there.

1296
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,199
You only get drinks at Sonic.

1297
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:05,409
OK, can we split Sonic into two different companies?

1298
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:08,729
Can it be like Sonic Food and Sonic Drink?

1299
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:14,439
Because Sonic Drink is like up here.

1300
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,479
Sonic Drink is probably somewhere up up in this area, I'd say at least.

1301
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,779
But the whole rest of the whole restaurant is fucking awful.

1302
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,789
In fact, I think Sonic could probably save

1303
01:24:27,989 --> 01:24:31,909
a bunch of money and like redo their whole business as just being like a dessert

1304
01:24:31,909 --> 01:24:35,819
drive thru place. I feel like way more people would care.

1305
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:40,279
Add more like desserts.

1306
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:42,600
Have it be like a cool dessert drink drive thru place.

1307
01:24:46,109 --> 01:24:50,520
Because if it was just that, it's up here.

1308
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,600
It really is. It's good.

1309
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,899
But I cannot give that rating.

1310
01:24:53,899 --> 01:24:55,180
It's not fair to do that.

1311
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:02,289
The drinks are like a tier.

1312
01:25:02,489 --> 01:25:03,770
Everything else.

1313
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:07,500
This place sucks, too.

1314
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:16,949
Have I become like a coffee, like snob or something?

1315
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:26,329
Like I, again, over expansion, right?

1316
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,279
Starbucks has got this is OK.

1317
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:37,020
Starbucks has gotten to the point where there are so many of them that they're now

1318
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:45,100
infiltrating grocery stores, targets, like malls, like what?

1319
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,380
They have five locations in a mile radius.

1320
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:50,460
That's not enough.

1321
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:55,020
They need to be in your they need to be in your target in your grocery store,

1322
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:57,539
in your gas station.

1323
01:25:57,539 --> 01:25:58,859
Like, why do they have to be?

1324
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:00,619
Why do you have to be in so many places?

1325
01:26:00,819 --> 01:26:10,319
Why like when I go to like a target, it's just like there's a Starbucks in here.

1326
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:13,939
It is just attached itself to every single other business.

1327
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,439
Relax.

1328
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:19,409
All right. All right.

1329
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:20,489
All right. I'm going to relax.

1330
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:22,619
All right. In your house.

1331
01:26:22,619 --> 01:26:26,060
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if one day I just like walked out of my bedroom

1332
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:30,500
and there was a kiosk over here, just sitting like in the hallway.

1333
01:26:31,899 --> 01:26:33,449
What can I get you?

1334
01:26:33,649 --> 01:26:36,930
Um, I don't I fucking don't want a Starbucks right now.

1335
01:26:38,899 --> 01:26:41,939
I'm going to go down to the bathroom and like use the bathroom and like wash my

1336
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,140
hands and like fucking coffee is going to come out of the faucet.

1337
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,319
And this is going to be a counter, like a money counter.

1338
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:49,439
Just

1339
01:26:50,279 --> 01:26:53,159
of how much money I'm spending by using my own fucking toilet.

1340
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:56,199
I'm going to flush the toilet and like coffee is going to go down the toilet.

1341
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:05,979
Starbucks, I've had it many, many times.

1342
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:13,189
But holy shit, it does like it's in too many places.

1343
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:15,630
It's so it's too much.

1344
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:21,270
That's not coffee, dude, that's poo poo.

1345
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:39,329
All I'm saying is when you expand so much that like when you can't what happens

1346
01:27:39,529 --> 01:27:45,350
when you can't expand anymore, there's a point where there's no longer

1347
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:52,699
any further you can go there in every fucking store you then you win.

1348
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:56,109
So it's like it's Starbucks going to go

1349
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:59,109
on to like the Nasdaq or whatever, like one of these days and just like

1350
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:04,560
smash the gavel and be like, boom, we won, we win.

1351
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:08,680
And then they're going to just take the D list, the stock.

1352
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,880
You know what the fuck is going to happen?

1353
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,020
I just want everyone to know that, yeah,

1354
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:17,899
Starbucks, we are in every single location, we're in everybody's house.

1355
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,420
We're attached to everybody's skateboards and bicycles.

1356
01:28:20,619 --> 01:28:24,220
We have a nozzle on the back of your hose on the back of your house.

1357
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:25,420
We win.

1358
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:29,560
And then they'll move on to do something else.

1359
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:34,210
And it'll be you're going to it's going to be like fucking Starbucks Prime.

1360
01:28:35,289 --> 01:28:36,529
I got to get Starbucks Prime.

1361
01:28:36,529 --> 01:28:38,329
Yeah, they're going to ship me my fucking like

1362
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:40,689
they're going to ship me my fucking deodorant that I ordered.

1363
01:28:40,689 --> 01:28:42,250
They're going to start to get in the shipping business.

1364
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:53,760
The coffee's OK.

1365
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:04,699
I thought you meant like like Optimus Prime.

1366
01:29:04,899 --> 01:29:07,100
What? Every Starbucks comes together.

1367
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,020
That's the big master plan.

1368
01:29:10,359 --> 01:29:13,520
They just like press the button that activates every Starbucks building.

1369
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,880
And they all come together and like

1370
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:19,359
Minecraft block, make a gigantic transformer and like take over the fucking galaxy.

1371
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:30,189
It was all operated by like baristas doing like espresso machines.

1372
01:29:31,659 --> 01:29:33,020
It's like steam powered.

1373
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:41,369
Anyways, I've never had it.

1374
01:29:41,569 --> 01:29:44,050
I know people love this shit, but I've never had it.

1375
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:46,170
I've seen a bunch of these.

1376
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:52,310
Well, here's a great way you can call me out on my bullshit, right?

1377
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:56,819
You want to see like you want to like compare data, see how much of a liar I

1378
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:01,739
possibly am, right? I did this like three years ago and I'm updating it.

1379
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:06,770
Did I like fake Andy like pretend that this place was good because everybody

1380
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:10,859
likes it and put it like up here like, oh, yes, take a shake.

1381
01:30:10,899 --> 01:30:11,659
It's good shit, man.

1382
01:30:11,859 --> 01:30:16,220
Like, did I like fake pretend like pander Andy, everybody?

1383
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:20,649
Because you can like compare this list,

1384
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:27,329
especially to like places that I don't really remember eating and be like he put

1385
01:30:27,829 --> 01:30:29,909
he put like steak and shake there.

1386
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:46,250
You did that with Popeyes.

1387
01:30:46,449 --> 01:30:47,970
Yeah, this is illegal. It can't be there.

1388
01:30:49,939 --> 01:30:50,739
I have never eaten it.

1389
01:30:50,739 --> 01:30:54,300
I can't say I like the way the menu looks and put it in a tier.

1390
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,420
That's not fair.

1391
01:30:56,060 --> 01:31:00,829
That's so unfair.

1392
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:01,989
I hate this place.

1393
01:31:02,189 --> 01:31:02,989
I'm sorry.

1394
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:30,100
I was standing in front of a subway one time and there were other restaurants

1395
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,659
like around this place.

1396
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:39,289
I was really hungry and I looked up the other restaurant on like Yelp

1397
01:31:40,619 --> 01:31:45,060
and this shit had like a three on Yelp, like a three, four.

1398
01:31:45,819 --> 01:31:51,439
I was like, oh, oh, I don't know about that.

1399
01:31:55,300 --> 01:32:09,789
And I didn't I didn't go to the subway call.

1400
01:32:09,829 --> 01:32:11,029
All right. I'm going to say this, too.

1401
01:32:11,229 --> 01:32:12,350
I probably said this before.

1402
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,220
Oh, I'm going to be elitist, Andy.

1403
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:18,420
No, I'm not.

1404
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:25,000
If you don't have at least a high three or four or four point, at least not going

1405
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:32,710
to your restaurant like you got to have at least like a high three.

1406
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:34,699
I refuse to go.

1407
01:32:34,899 --> 01:32:36,060
I'm not going to go.

1408
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:50,600
None of these count, by the way, because you want to do an experiment.

1409
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:58,079
Go to go type in McDonald's into your like Google Maps or like

1410
01:32:58,279 --> 01:33:02,899
Apple Maps or whatever, right, and try to find a McDonald's or any

1411
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:07,760
of these fast food kind of restaurants, right, that are over like a two five.

1412
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:10,149
They're all like two point six.

1413
01:33:10,149 --> 01:33:10,630
Yeah.

1414
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:15,130
All these fast food restaurants match my GPA that I had in fucking like high school

1415
01:33:15,329 --> 01:33:24,239
and college, but I'm talking about like a non chain restaurant.

1416
01:33:25,699 --> 01:33:27,220
If you're a non chain restaurant

1417
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:31,779
and you don't have at least like a three, six, three, seven on like Google and Yelp,

1418
01:33:33,949 --> 01:33:36,069
I'm not eating it. I'm not going to eat there.

1419
01:33:37,149 --> 01:33:38,029
It's very powerful.

1420
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:39,310
It's incredibly powerful.

1421
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:49,619
Or five, four, three, four, eight.

1422
01:33:49,819 --> 01:33:51,340
What's wrong with your McDonald's?

1423
01:33:53,819 --> 01:33:56,819
Where you guys have high ranking McDonald's near you.

1424
01:33:58,479 --> 01:33:59,840
My local ones are three five.

1425
01:34:00,039 --> 01:34:06,609
What? Why is every McDonald's have been to like a two, a one, like a one point five?

1426
01:34:08,899 --> 01:34:10,460
It's because you live in a city.

1427
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,239
My McDonald's has a three eight.

1428
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:20,659
What is because you live in Las Vegas?

1429
01:34:29,229 --> 01:34:30,750
I think most of the McDonald's around here,

1430
01:34:30,949 --> 01:34:39,850
I think have like high twos or like mid twos or at least three or low threes.

1431
01:34:40,539 --> 01:34:45,600
Hold on. I got to fucking see.

1432
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:53,409
Yours is three nine.

1433
01:34:53,609 --> 01:34:56,920
No way. I don't believe that everybody.

1434
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:01,039
Look, the reason why I'm saying this is not because all these those restaurants are

1435
01:35:01,239 --> 01:35:07,270
like twos, it's because people find reasons to fucking hate fast food restaurants.

1436
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:09,380
I don't know what it is,

1437
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:13,619
but like you will read some of these reviews and you will I'll be OK.

1438
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:16,739
I'll be like in the drive thru and you like over here.

1439
01:35:16,739 --> 01:35:18,060
The things that people are saying.

1440
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:21,739
And it's just like, why is this person such a dick?

1441
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,159
Like, what is it with people that I like?

1442
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:26,079
I don't understand.

1443
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,899
Like, let me tell you something.

1444
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:35,239
There was a ketchup packet that wasn't put in my bag and the food's fucking awful.

1445
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:36,399
It was awful, by the way.

1446
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,439
It was it wasn't like the most high quality

1447
01:35:38,439 --> 01:35:42,560
five star restaurant food that I come to expect when I pay good money for something.

1448
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,920
It's like, dude, you're at McDonald's.

1449
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:46,579
Like, what are you talking about?

1450
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:55,279
People put like fast food on this like fucking insane pedestal where it's like,

1451
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,659
is that burger Angus beef?

1452
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:01,239
That'd be like, well, it's fucking McDonald's, man.

1453
01:36:01,239 --> 01:36:02,800
Relax. It's like Burger King.

1454
01:36:04,069 --> 01:36:06,670
And a lot of those workers are like trying to fucking help you.

1455
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:16,819
I feel for some of these fucking workers, seriously, because, man, you hear the stories

1456
01:36:16,819 --> 01:36:20,340
of people that just you just mean just shit people through the fucking drive

1457
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,260
through people fucking with the restaurant and stuff.

1458
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:24,829
Holy shit, man.

1459
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:36,149
Give me your money.

1460
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:38,510
Why did I read that person?

1461
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:43,760
Anyways, I've never had taco bueno.

1462
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:45,779
I've never had this.

1463
01:36:46,539 --> 01:36:47,539
I've never had this.

1464
01:36:48,039 --> 01:36:49,399
I've never had this.

1465
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:51,470
I've never had this.

1466
01:36:51,979 --> 01:36:53,180
I don't live in Canada.

1467
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:55,470
I've never had this.

1468
01:36:56,869 --> 01:36:58,310
I've never had Waffle House.

1469
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:00,899
I've never had Wawa.

1470
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:02,180
I've had Wendy's.

1471
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:15,300
This is not done.

1472
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,659
It's not done.

1473
01:37:16,859 --> 01:37:17,699
I'm not done.

1474
01:37:17,899 --> 01:37:19,220
I've not had Wawa.

1475
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,489
This is unfair, though, because I'm biased towards Mexican food.

1476
01:37:31,689 --> 01:37:33,930
Would I rather have Wendy's or Del Taco?

1477
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:43,380
I'm completely biased to Mexican food, so I would probably rather go to Del Taco

1478
01:37:44,069 --> 01:37:46,550
or Taco Bell or fast food.

1479
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:53,930
You put Wendy's behind Del Taco because of fries.

1480
01:37:55,649 --> 01:37:59,729
I would rather go to a Mexican restaurant than a burger restaurant.

1481
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:08,060
I just told you that Mexican food is my number one favorite food of all the genres.

1482
01:38:09,029 --> 01:38:12,760
It goes Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian,

1483
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:19,170
or sometimes depending on the day, that flips.

1484
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:25,489
I've not had Whataburger.

1485
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:31,800
White Castle should be here, but I've never really had it.

1486
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,720
I've seen it in the freezers.

1487
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:38,979
Wait, I think maybe I've had it once.

1488
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:44,229
Some of these places that I just don't remember eating, I've had maybe one time.

1489
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:53,210
Fuck, which sandwiches?

1490
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,619
Never had Wienerschnitzel.

1491
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:59,409
I've never had Wingstop.

1492
01:39:00,829 --> 01:39:03,310
I don't know what this place is, and I don't know what this place is.

1493
01:39:11,109 --> 01:39:12,310
I've never had Wingstop, I've never had it.

1494
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:21,500
It's time to clean this up a little bit and get this in a spot where I'm comfortable.

1495
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:33,359
We've got to start at the bottom.

1496
01:39:34,119 --> 01:39:35,680
You have this. I've been here for two hours.

1497
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,159
Holy shit, this is a lot of fun.

1498
01:39:37,539 --> 01:39:38,619
I like life. I love this.

1499
01:39:38,819 --> 01:39:43,140
This is great fun. I'm fucking blessed.

1500
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:49,289
I love this. All right, subway.

1501
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:51,489
We have so many more things to do today.

1502
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:55,699
This is the longest one because this has the most amount of things on it.

1503
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:58,449
This is probably arguably the most important to a lot of you.

1504
01:39:58,649 --> 01:40:00,770
This is the big one, so we're going to do the big one first.

1505
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:02,229
You know what I'm saying?

1506
01:40:02,859 --> 01:40:04,420
All right, Subway and Sonic.

1507
01:40:04,619 --> 01:40:07,380
I would probably rather I would rather go

1508
01:40:07,579 --> 01:40:11,979
to Subway than Sonic just because I know I know the food will be fucking warm.

1509
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:14,500
I just I really hate to say it, but I do mean that.

1510
01:40:15,779 --> 01:40:18,060
I'd rather go to Subway than Dunkin' Donuts,

1511
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:22,140
but I don't know if I would put Dunkin' Donuts disgusting.

1512
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,779
I know it's so itchy.

1513
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,500
Would I rather go to Subway than Domino's?

1514
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:43,930
I don't think so.

1515
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:48,479
Would I rather go to Burger King or Domino's Burger King?

1516
01:40:53,659 --> 01:40:54,460
Yeah, I can say that.

1517
01:40:54,619 --> 01:40:58,060
Would rather go to Burger King or Dairy Queen?

1518
01:41:01,699 --> 01:41:03,300
I would rather go to Burger King.

1519
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:12,789
But does that mean the Dairy Queen should be down at poor?

1520
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,560
Would I rather go to Domino's than Dairy Queen?

1521
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:21,970
Nope, because the ice cream that stays.

1522
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:34,819
Would I rather go to Burger King than Cinnabon?

1523
01:41:36,539 --> 01:41:39,340
Yeah, Cinnabon is just like a one menu, Andy.

1524
01:41:39,539 --> 01:41:40,500
Yeah, I probably would.

1525
01:41:40,699 --> 01:41:42,220
Would rather go to Dairy Queen than Cinnabon?

1526
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:54,460
Yes, I can say an average one menu item, Andy.

1527
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,229
But it's good.

1528
01:41:58,699 --> 01:42:02,220
I just don't think if we're basing this on like where I would where I would rather

1529
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:13,029
go or what I would deem to be better to go, I mean, I could just rate on the merits

1530
01:42:13,229 --> 01:42:17,350
of just quality of the food, but then this shouldn't be up here.

1531
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:20,100
You know what I mean?

1532
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:23,539
I'm basing this on like what I would prefer to do, where I would want to go,

1533
01:42:23,539 --> 01:42:24,939
where I would where I would go.

1534
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,439
I'm going to keep it for now.

1535
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:35,720
All right.

1536
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,720
Would I rather go to Burger King than Starbucks?

1537
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,100
Probably not. I would rather go to Starbucks.

1538
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:51,850
Denny's or Starbucks, Starbucks, IHOP or Starbucks?

1539
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:53,569
What's better? Probably Starbucks.

1540
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,159
Hold on. We're moving a lot of people around here.

1541
01:42:58,359 --> 01:42:59,439
Burger King or Denny's?

1542
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:00,399
I'd rather go to Burger King.

1543
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:01,640
No, I'd rather go to Denny's.

1544
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:03,609
No, depends on the day.

1545
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:05,239
What time is it?

1546
01:43:07,859 --> 01:43:09,340
What time is it right now?

1547
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:12,180
Is it over midnight?

1548
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:14,359
Is it like 2 a.m.?

1549
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,159
If it's 2 a.m., this is up here.

1550
01:43:17,939 --> 01:43:21,619
If it's like four o'clock in the afternoon, it's like down here.

1551
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,159
This is hard.

1552
01:43:30,949 --> 01:43:33,149
I would probably rather go to Denny's than Burger King.

1553
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:34,579
No, I wouldn't.

1554
01:43:37,899 --> 01:43:39,420
I would rather go to Denny's than IHOP.

1555
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:46,329
That's for sure. So this has to go down here.

1556
01:43:46,529 --> 01:43:48,569
Do I think Arby's is better than Cold Stone?

1557
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:50,689
No. Do I think Starbucks is better than Arby's?

1558
01:43:50,689 --> 01:43:51,130
Yes.

1559
01:43:52,979 --> 01:43:56,260
Again, it's just like a quality and like food and like what I'd rather have.

1560
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:00,939
I'd rather go to Denny's than Arby's.

1561
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:02,220
I'd rather go to Burger King than Arby's.

1562
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,250
Would I rather go to...

1563
01:44:07,449 --> 01:44:09,289
Do I think Dairy Queen is better than Arby's?

1564
01:44:09,659 --> 01:44:12,930
Yes, because they have ice cream.

1565
01:44:20,409 --> 01:44:22,729
But Arby's too disgusting.

1566
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,039
Arby's has ice cream?

1567
01:44:31,239 --> 01:44:34,520
Not Dairy Queen is known for their like blizzards and ice cream.

1568
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,439
That's not the same.

1569
01:44:38,699 --> 01:44:39,979
Are you wearing lipstick today?

1570
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:43,939
I'm using chapstick because my lips get very dry.

1571
01:44:47,159 --> 01:44:48,279
Thanks for reminding me to do it.

1572
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:56,100
But Arby's has a funny Twitter.

1573
01:44:57,819 --> 01:45:03,460
If you honestly think I give a shit about like what is going on on like a comp,

1574
01:45:03,659 --> 01:45:08,539
like a fast food Twitter, I fucking care.

1575
01:45:08,739 --> 01:45:12,180
That's the last thing I can think of that I would like care about,

1576
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:16,000
is what does Arby's have to say about this?

1577
01:45:16,199 --> 01:45:23,010
It's funny, I guess, right?

1578
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:24,369
Like if they say something funny,

1579
01:45:25,579 --> 01:45:29,619
but I'm not like actively searching for what like Dairy Queen had to say

1580
01:45:29,619 --> 01:45:30,819
about something like a topic.

1581
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:36,920
I don't... Have you seen Twitter?

1582
01:45:38,279 --> 01:45:43,649
Guys, I'm on social media maybe once or twice a month, maybe.

1583
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:48,779
I like Twitter, Discord,

1584
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:50,060
and it doesn't matter.

1585
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:53,739
I like I don't use social media really that much at all.

1586
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:58,340
So if I miss like the cool thing that like Burger King said, I'm going to miss it.

1587
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:03,390
Make a tier below disgusting and put Arby's in it.

1588
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:05,710
No, because I can't speak to that.

1589
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:09,869
I've had it a few times and I don't remember it being like horrendous.

1590
01:46:10,069 --> 01:46:12,149
I remember it was just it was fine.

1591
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:15,619
And that's sometimes all you want is fine.

1592
01:46:15,819 --> 01:46:18,140
You don't need to have every single restaurant.

1593
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:21,859
Everything in average is not bad.

1594
01:46:21,899 --> 01:46:23,140
It's stuff that I would eat.

1595
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:28,119
If you presented me with a Jimmy John's sandwich right now and said,

1596
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:32,850
would you eat that? I'd go, yeah, I would.

1597
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:37,579
If you presented me with a fresh Cinnabon, I'd go, yeah, sure.

1598
01:46:37,779 --> 01:46:38,539
I'll take it.

1599
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:47,569
If you presented me with a gross grilled cheese from Friendly's,

1600
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,779
I'd eat it, but I wouldn't be very happy about it.

1601
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:07,439
But Friendly's shouldn't.

1602
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:11,310
Friendly's is like a restaurant for kids.

1603
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:19,279
OK, Friendly's is a place where the whole menu is the kids menu.

1604
01:47:19,479 --> 01:47:22,279
I'm doing it, I think a little bit of

1605
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:32,100
disservice here by putting it here, but I think I'm going to keep it here.

1606
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:35,579
It's a great place to take like kids.

1607
01:47:35,779 --> 01:47:37,899
I've been to a few, at least three or four

1608
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:42,220
Friendly's before in my life, and people were really nice.

1609
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:44,619
They were really, you know, if you go with like a couple of kids,

1610
01:47:44,819 --> 01:47:47,779
it's like they come and get milkshakes and like the staff was really friendly

1611
01:47:47,779 --> 01:47:49,260
and everyone was like, it was fine. It was good.

1612
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:50,260
It was it was fine.

1613
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,720
So I don't I'm not going to put it down here.

1614
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,039
I don't think it deserves to be down there.

1615
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:02,329
It's a place to get like an ice cream

1616
01:48:02,329 --> 01:48:04,770
and bring like the kids to have like a lunch or something.

1617
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,850
And they get to go the kids get to go to a restaurant.

1618
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:08,449
Excuse me, I'm putting this up.

1619
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:12,439
They give you the little thing with the crayons.

1620
01:48:12,439 --> 01:48:15,680
They give you a piece of paper with like activities and quizzes on it and stuff.

1621
01:48:16,569 --> 01:48:18,210
Yeah, this is not fair at all.

1622
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:19,170
It's unfair.

1623
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,289
This is a nice this is a nice place.

1624
01:48:22,489 --> 01:48:24,130
It's a really just nice little place.

1625
01:48:31,289 --> 01:48:32,250
I'll fix it later.

1626
01:48:36,909 --> 01:48:39,109
Every time I've gone to like friendlies,

1627
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:45,060
the response from the children was that was great.

1628
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:47,100
That was it was a great time.

1629
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:50,850
And if that's what they're trying to do, then they know they're not going to go

1630
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:52,289
down here. No, they're not.

1631
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:58,789
What children?

1632
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:07,289
As I have nieces and nephews, I have like siblings.

1633
01:49:07,489 --> 01:49:09,010
A place to take the kids.

1634
01:49:11,819 --> 01:49:16,460
OK, I got to hurry up because we have like 30 things to do.

1635
01:49:16,659 --> 01:49:18,979
And I've already like on this for three hours.

1636
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:26,789
Holdstone is good, but it's hard to rate the ice cream places

1637
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,000
because they only do ice cream. It's hard to do this.

1638
01:49:31,079 --> 01:49:34,520
So I'm just going to say I'd probably would go to Starbucks.

1639
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,760
I would rather I would probably go to Panera.

1640
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:40,260
Yeah, I'd go to Panera friendlies.

1641
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:42,180
Yeah, I mean, of course, take those kids.

1642
01:49:42,939 --> 01:49:44,579
Chipotle can stay here.

1643
01:49:44,579 --> 01:49:45,500
Most can stay here.

1644
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:47,420
Einstein Brothers Bagels needs to come way up.

1645
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:48,739
Little Caesar has to come way down.

1646
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:53,840
Jason's Deli needs to go down as well.

1647
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:58,909
I would actually have to put these here and I would rather go to Panera.

1648
01:49:59,609 --> 01:50:00,609
Like just straight up.

1649
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:07,840
They are they are like equal in my brain.

1650
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,159
But I would I have that cheddar broccoli soup from Panera.

1651
01:50:10,359 --> 01:50:11,840
You just you can't you can't beat it.

1652
01:50:17,779 --> 01:50:19,579
I'm imagining me going into Jason's Deli

1653
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:21,500
and getting like what I would order at Jason's Deli.

1654
01:50:21,699 --> 01:50:25,020
And then the the cheddar broccoli soup in a bread bowl.

1655
01:50:25,909 --> 01:50:26,829
And I want that more.

1656
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:35,489
What are you eating at Starbucks?

1657
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:37,250
Like I said, that's why it's hard to do

1658
01:50:37,449 --> 01:50:40,329
some of these restaurants that only have one product.

1659
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,119
All right. Little Caesar's.

1660
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:48,920
These are kind of on these are all in the same tier for me, I think.

1661
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,720
These are on the same tier, but I'd rather go here.

1662
01:50:52,890 --> 01:50:55,289
I'd rather go here than all these places combined.

1663
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:57,579
I'd rather go to KFC.

1664
01:50:58,340 --> 01:51:00,779
I'd rather go to I'd rather go to KFC than Pizza Hut.

1665
01:51:01,609 --> 01:51:04,449
I'd rather go to Einstein Brothers Bagels and all these.

1666
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:05,850
So Baro's good.

1667
01:51:10,189 --> 01:51:11,630
Where do I put Jack in the box?

1668
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:16,300
I would probably rather go to KFC than Jack.

1669
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,579
No, I wouldn't. Those little mini tacos.

1670
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:20,359
Holy shit.

1671
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:24,199
A little mini ones.

1672
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:25,520
It's like taco popcorn.

1673
01:51:35,369 --> 01:51:38,050
But Rutgers is coming down a little bit because to me,

1674
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:42,220
Rutgers is like it's like an attraction restaurant to me.

1675
01:51:43,069 --> 01:51:45,750
I've been to a couple of attractions

1676
01:51:46,579 --> 01:51:53,710
that had a Fudd Rutgers there and I've never seen it anywhere else.

1677
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:59,460
And I think I've only had I think it was a good it was good.

1678
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:02,380
It was I think I've only had it like once, though, twice, maybe.

1679
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:13,750
I don't remember how much I liked it,

1680
01:52:13,949 --> 01:52:17,619
but I would probably I would rather go here if I'm honest.

1681
01:52:21,329 --> 01:52:22,649
All right. This is where it gets interesting.

1682
01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:24,489
But I'd rather go to Jack in the box.

1683
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:31,899
I'd rather go to I'd rather go to Moe's than Blaze Pizza.

1684
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:33,979
Blaze Pizza I think is lower than Moe's.

1685
01:52:34,359 --> 01:52:36,079
Jimmy John's has to come way down.

1686
01:52:36,279 --> 01:52:37,720
Krispy Kreme come way down.

1687
01:52:38,539 --> 01:52:39,939
Jersey Mike's way down.

1688
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:50,699
These are only down here because they're just you go get a donut.

1689
01:52:50,899 --> 01:52:54,020
You go get a Cinnabon.

1690
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:56,960
What do you want me to do?

1691
01:52:57,159 --> 01:53:00,319
They're good, but it's like there's only one thing you can do.

1692
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:03,340
Firehouse does not stay.

1693
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:17,170
Firehouse is going to move to a dessert category.

1694
01:53:17,369 --> 01:53:19,369
That's probably not a bad idea.

1695
01:53:19,569 --> 01:53:23,770
That's not a bad idea to just have dessert be a separate category.

1696
01:53:23,770 --> 01:53:25,689
But is there even enough to do a separate category?

1697
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:28,170
One, two, three, four, five.

1698
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:29,010
There is. OK.

1699
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,920
Play Elden Ring. It's not out yet.

1700
01:53:37,149 --> 01:53:38,829
And I'm going to I'm going to piss my pants.

1701
01:53:39,029 --> 01:53:40,789
I've been drinking fucking coffee.

1702
01:53:41,359 --> 01:53:45,100
I'll be right back.

1703
01:53:45,300 --> 02:00:00,529
Airbnb. I have returned.

1704
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:15,850
How are you? All right.

1705
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:20,439
What were we doing? Oh, yeah.

1706
02:00:20,439 --> 02:00:23,840
I was showing you my awesome tier list that everyone is going to agree with.

1707
02:00:35,289 --> 02:00:38,489
Oh, would I rather I got to get the top done, right?

1708
02:00:45,010 --> 02:00:45,970
Do another tier list.

1709
02:00:46,170 --> 02:00:48,409
I had there are I have a lot of tier list.

1710
02:00:48,609 --> 02:00:52,170
We're going to have to go quick for some of these.

1711
02:00:54,979 --> 02:00:56,140
I think I like this.

1712
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:57,180
I like how this is.

1713
02:00:57,180 --> 02:01:00,699
I would rather go to I would rather go to Jack in the Box than Ania's.

1714
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:04,689
Oh, I probably would rather go.

1715
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:06,409
I don't know if I would rather go to Jollibee.

1716
02:01:08,699 --> 02:01:10,699
It's good, but not to bar.

1717
02:01:10,899 --> 02:01:12,380
I think this is accurate.

1718
02:01:16,279 --> 02:01:18,079
You need to put a time limit on yourself.

1719
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:19,460
I don't have to put a time.

1720
02:01:19,659 --> 02:01:22,970
Look, I I'm going to be live for a while.

1721
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:26,779
I said a few hours, but I should have said several.

1722
02:01:26,979 --> 02:01:31,380
I should have said several hours because this is going to be a lot longer than I

1723
02:01:31,579 --> 02:01:43,520
think it is. I'm so burpy.

1724
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:45,909
OK, all right, let's go.

1725
02:01:45,909 --> 02:01:46,550
Let's do it.

1726
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:49,380
I'd rather go to Del Taco than Wendy's.

1727
02:01:49,579 --> 02:01:50,420
I just would.

1728
02:01:50,619 --> 02:01:52,819
I would rather go to In-N-Out than Del Taco.

1729
02:01:52,819 --> 02:01:55,340
I think that Boston Market probably can stay there.

1730
02:01:56,039 --> 02:02:01,319
That's just bias from the part of the country that I have like lived in most of

1731
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:05,300
my life, so I don't know if it should be there.

1732
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:07,340
I would five guys.

1733
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:17,109
Haynes is so good.

1734
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:27,840
This is a battle because I've had both of these pretty I've had them pretty recently.

1735
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:05,510
Ben and Jerry's just Ben and Jerry shouldn't be up here.

1736
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:09,590
I I like eating the pints of Ben and Jerry's from the grocery store.

1737
02:03:09,789 --> 02:03:10,789
This shouldn't be up here.

1738
02:03:11,229 --> 02:03:14,670
I'm going to keep it here, but I'm going to move it because like it honestly

1739
02:03:14,670 --> 02:03:15,430
shouldn't be here.

1740
02:03:15,869 --> 02:03:17,590
This is really what it probably looks like.

1741
02:03:17,789 --> 02:03:22,539
We're just this is because like nostalgia purposes, this is here ego.

1742
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:26,699
I have completed my updated tier list.

1743
02:03:42,619 --> 02:03:43,859
There's no being too high.

1744
02:03:51,020 --> 02:03:53,500
The reason OK, the reason why Keynes is

1745
02:03:53,699 --> 02:04:02,319
number one is I just imagined myself taking that hot dog roll Texas toast thing

1746
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:05,359
and dunking it in the sauce and biting it.

1747
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:11,130
And it was a far better experience than everything else on this whole list.

1748
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:14,300
On the whole list.

1749
02:04:16,409 --> 02:04:19,729
So that's why I think it deserves to be there on my updated list.

1750
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:26,819
Haynes sauce sucks.

1751
02:04:28,979 --> 02:04:30,300
What do we do? What do we do with them?

1752
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:33,600
You decide what do we do with them?

1753
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:34,800
What do we do with them?

1754
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:38,840
What do we do with them?

1755
02:04:39,039 --> 02:04:40,640
That's like cross-eyed.

1756
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:42,840
What what what do we do with that guy?

1757
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:44,039
What do we do with them?

1758
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:47,130
What do we do with that guy?

1759
02:04:53,710 --> 02:04:55,270
You guys didn't know I could move one eye.

1760
02:05:11,479 --> 02:05:12,920
Don't do that. It like it sucks.

1761
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:18,539
Stop. I can.

1762
02:05:18,739 --> 02:05:20,100
Oh, shit, I forgot.

1763
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:23,020
I forgot there's a screen cap feature.

1764
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:25,140
New meme.

1765
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:32,819
Yeah, what did it look like?

1766
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:43,390
I already regret it. Yeah, I regret it already.

1767
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:50,829
Can I see it?

1768
02:05:51,029 --> 02:05:53,550
When the Keynes sauce hits.

1769
02:06:00,899 --> 02:06:01,859
Hold on.

1770
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:04,149
I'm going to get out of here.

1771
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:13,729
I'm leaving.

1772
02:06:13,930 --> 02:06:20,420
Oh,

1773
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:23,939
when the Keynes sauce hits.

1774
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:27,420
No,

1775
02:06:27,619 --> 02:06:46,649
fuck, I got to zoom in.

1776
02:06:46,850 --> 02:06:47,890
Hold on. No, I can't.

1777
02:06:48,090 --> 02:06:51,750
I'll mess up the whole thing.

1778
02:06:51,949 --> 02:06:55,560
OK, I'm moving on to the next list.

1779
02:06:57,920 --> 02:07:00,760
Here's here's my final thoughts on that one.

1780
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:01,640
There it is.

1781
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:07,880
That's the new worst face.

1782
02:07:10,109 --> 02:07:13,670
I don't think it's consequences for any of my actions, unfortunately.

1783
02:07:13,869 --> 02:07:14,550
Here you go.

1784
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:24,920
It has been completed.

1785
02:07:25,119 --> 02:07:25,840
There it is.

1786
02:07:26,039 --> 02:07:28,159
There is my official updated list.

1787
02:07:28,539 --> 02:07:29,939
We're going to move on to the next one.

1788
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:32,270
Take a look. There you go.

1789
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:33,189
You want your screenshot?

1790
02:07:33,189 --> 02:07:35,880
There it is.

1791
02:07:36,079 --> 02:07:39,699
I don't know anything about that.

1792
02:07:40,659 --> 02:07:42,460
Oh, wait, I was facing the wrong way.

1793
02:07:42,659 --> 02:07:44,579
Who cares?

1794
02:07:44,779 --> 02:07:49,020
This next one is an update called best fruits.

1795
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:49,779
I've done this already.

1796
02:07:49,779 --> 02:07:51,020
Let's see if I can see.

1797
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:52,460
This is going to take a long time.

1798
02:07:56,420 --> 02:07:57,060
This is going to take a while.

1799
02:07:57,260 --> 02:07:59,100
I've been eating a lot more fruits.

1800
02:07:59,789 --> 02:08:01,949
I've been eating a lot more vegetables and fruits lately.

1801
02:08:03,539 --> 02:08:04,460
I'm going to see.

1802
02:08:04,659 --> 02:08:06,460
We'll compare it to the last one.

1803
02:08:07,539 --> 02:08:09,220
I'm going to do this very quick.

1804
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:12,979
OK, lemon S.

1805
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:14,500
Banana S.

1806
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:17,699
Hair B.

1807
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:20,000
Green apple A.

1808
02:08:20,199 --> 02:08:21,640
Red apple D.

1809
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:22,840
Fuck red apples.

1810
02:08:23,409 --> 02:08:24,369
Apricots.

1811
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:26,220
I don't really eat it.

1812
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:31,039
I've never had one. Avocado B.

1813
02:08:31,239 --> 02:08:34,350
Blackberry flavor S.

1814
02:08:35,369 --> 02:08:37,619
Practice C.

1815
02:08:37,819 --> 02:08:40,260
I don't I don't like the fucking popcorn shells you get in your mouth.

1816
02:08:40,460 --> 02:08:42,710
All the all the berries, raspberries,

1817
02:08:42,909 --> 02:08:45,340
blackberries,

1818
02:08:45,539 --> 02:08:48,579
any of the berries that have the seeds because you'll bite them,

1819
02:08:48,779 --> 02:08:51,590
you'll eat them and you get the fucking popcorn shells.

1820
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:55,380
And it's like, oh,

1821
02:08:55,579 --> 02:08:57,779
oh, I feel like a little like hard ball.

1822
02:08:58,220 --> 02:09:01,479
I don't like it. They taste phenomenal, though, but we're just going on.

1823
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:03,239
I have to be fair to myself.

1824
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:06,500
Kiwis S. No, they're A.

1825
02:09:06,699 --> 02:09:10,020
I've only ever had blackcurrant juice and blackcurrant jam.

1826
02:09:10,659 --> 02:09:12,140
I've never actually eaten the real fruit.

1827
02:09:12,140 --> 02:09:13,220
So I'm going to put it down here.

1828
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:17,189
Blueberry. That's going to be that's going to be low A.

1829
02:09:17,189 --> 02:09:20,029
And I'm putting blueberry in low A and not S where it belongs,

1830
02:09:20,409 --> 02:09:22,489
because blueberries are very interesting.

1831
02:09:23,119 --> 02:09:26,279
They either are awful, like mushy and gross.

1832
02:09:26,479 --> 02:09:30,880
Or if you get a good pack, if you get good ones, they're unbelievable.

1833
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,000
They're better than anything in the world.

1834
02:09:33,399 --> 02:09:34,800
I have to take that into consideration.

1835
02:09:36,779 --> 02:09:39,779
Cantaloupe D. Worst.

1836
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:43,420
Absolute worst. I hate melon.

1837
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:44,899
I hate I hate it. I think it's awful.

1838
02:09:45,979 --> 02:09:47,140
Cantaloupe is this stuff again.

1839
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:47,819
I'll say it again.

1840
02:09:47,819 --> 02:09:49,180
And I probably said this a few years ago.

1841
02:09:49,550 --> 02:09:54,229
Cantaloupe is the stuff that you pick around in a fruit salad and you just leave.

1842
02:09:54,430 --> 02:09:57,789
And then if you still are really, really hungry and you still.

1843
02:09:57,989 --> 02:09:59,390
Whoa.

1844
02:10:00,310 --> 02:10:01,949
If you still really, really hungry,

1845
02:10:02,289 --> 02:10:05,569
you'll eat those last if you really are still feeling it.

1846
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:09,359
Cherries, the actual fruit is probably

1847
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:12,119
like a C, but cherry juice and cherry stuff is higher.

1848
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:16,159
But I'm just basing this not on flavor.

1849
02:10:16,659 --> 02:10:19,420
I'm basing this on if I were to eat this thing.

1850
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:22,180
So that means this should not be up here.

1851
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:23,819
But I do that shit. I'm a weirdo.

1852
02:10:26,369 --> 02:10:27,689
I'm a weird motherfucker.

1853
02:10:27,890 --> 02:10:30,260
I like and go,

1854
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:36,430
dragon fruit is I think dragon fruit takes over lemon.

1855
02:10:40,069 --> 02:10:41,109
But is it flavor?

1856
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:43,630
I think we have to take everything into consideration.

1857
02:10:47,399 --> 02:10:52,100
Dragon fruit is what I want blackberries and raspberries to be

1858
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:56,560
because the little seeds in dragon fruit are wonderful.

1859
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,640
You bite into a dragon fruit and it's like this little nice crispy crunch.

1860
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:02,840
Go through the seed.

1861
02:11:03,729 --> 02:11:05,010
It's so wonderful.

1862
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:07,289
You can't do that with blackberries and raspberries.

1863
02:11:09,010 --> 02:11:10,250
Biting into a blackberry.

1864
02:11:10,449 --> 02:11:14,289
It's like the dragon fruit.

1865
02:11:14,489 --> 02:11:16,930
It's like pillowy little crispy seeds.

1866
02:11:19,350 --> 02:11:20,510
I love dragon fruit.

1867
02:11:23,899 --> 02:11:27,220
Coconut, the coconut flavor is F,

1868
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:32,939
but the coconut water, coconut milk and coconut flavor is somewhere around here.

1869
02:11:34,659 --> 02:11:36,060
So that's what we'll average it out.

1870
02:11:36,819 --> 02:11:38,460
Cranberries. See you later.

1871
02:11:40,109 --> 02:11:41,550
Flavor, S.

1872
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:43,619
Texture, S.

1873
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:47,729
Health factor, S.

1874
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:52,069
Tanginess, S.

1875
02:11:53,729 --> 02:11:55,470
Sweetness, F.

1876
02:12:04,619 --> 02:12:08,340
I've never had it, but I know it smells.

1877
02:12:08,539 --> 02:12:11,340
Figs are depends on how they're prepared.

1878
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:13,979
I'm going to put them in C. Gooseberries.

1879
02:12:13,979 --> 02:12:15,420
They got a funny name, but I've never had them.

1880
02:12:15,789 --> 02:12:21,909
Grapefruit is F. Grapefruit just tastes like stomach acid.

1881
02:12:22,109 --> 02:12:23,029
I think I've said this before.

1882
02:12:23,069 --> 02:12:26,189
I've I've had burps that taste better than grapefruit.

1883
02:12:29,770 --> 02:12:35,180
I get to use that joke again, don't I?

1884
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:36,300
OK, grapes.

1885
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:38,819
Grapes are like blueberries.

1886
02:12:39,449 --> 02:12:44,699
If you get really good, like firm, juicy, cold grapes, they're amazing.

1887
02:12:44,899 --> 02:12:52,500
But if you get the fucking wilty kind of like sludge and they can go really low.

1888
02:12:54,659 --> 02:13:01,890
So they have I love them, though, if they're good, especially frozen grapes.

1889
02:13:02,090 --> 02:13:07,000
We might have to update this. Lime, S.

1890
02:13:07,159 --> 02:13:10,840
The only time I've ever had lychee is when it was in like a weird booze drink.

1891
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:13,600
Oh, not really mango.

1892
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:15,479
Hmm. What could it be is all right.

1893
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:16,880
Nectarine. Excuse me.

1894
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:20,100
This goes up here. Orange.

1895
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:25,720
The fruit sucks worse than probably everything, but the flavor is unbelievable.

1896
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:31,739
I hate eating oranges because of the weird,

1897
02:13:31,939 --> 02:13:38,220
gross sinew that's in an orange, that like white sinew.

1898
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:42,300
Like, it's like a fucking like, you know,

1899
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:43,140
disgusting.

1900
02:13:45,619 --> 02:13:49,420
I'm going to put it down at sea because I love orange juice and I love orange flavor,

1901
02:13:50,890 --> 02:13:53,729
but I cannot eat oranges. That's that's like weird.

1902
02:13:53,729 --> 02:13:54,529
It's got that. OK.

1903
02:13:54,729 --> 02:13:59,170
You know, like a raw chicken, like the raw chicken, like like fat that's on it

1904
02:13:59,170 --> 02:14:00,770
that you like kind of have to take off.

1905
02:14:00,970 --> 02:14:05,409
That's what it's like on an orange pie.

1906
02:14:05,609 --> 02:14:08,279
I don't really I don't really eat pie.

1907
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:10,300
I don't really eat passion fruit.

1908
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:13,420
It's just on every single box that has like tea in the name.

1909
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:16,289
Oh, it's got passion fruit tea, passion fruit.

1910
02:14:16,289 --> 02:14:17,250
Like, I don't know.

1911
02:14:17,819 --> 02:14:20,020
Peaches are underneath nectarine, but they're still really good.

1912
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:23,560
Although I'd probably put them down here at the permission.

1913
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:24,439
I don't know what that is.

1914
02:14:25,199 --> 02:14:26,720
Pineapple is up here as well.

1915
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:28,600
I love fruits, as you can tell.

1916
02:14:29,420 --> 02:14:32,699
Plums, I like the way they taste, but they're hard to kind of like weird

1917
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:41,229
pomegranate or also like weird alien fruits, but they taste really good.

1918
02:14:41,229 --> 02:14:42,069
They're just hard to eat.

1919
02:14:42,069 --> 02:14:43,789
And I don't know, it's difficult to eat.

1920
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:48,890
I don't know what this is.

1921
02:14:49,779 --> 02:14:50,899
Redcurrant, I don't know what that is.

1922
02:14:50,899 --> 02:14:53,550
I'm going to put it next to this one starfruit.

1923
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:56,869
I mean, like if I was 12, I would probably put this higher

1924
02:14:56,869 --> 02:14:58,310
because it's like a Super Mario star.

1925
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:59,869
But like, I don't really I've never had it.

1926
02:14:59,909 --> 02:15:00,390
I don't care.

1927
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:02,279
Strawberry is up here somewhere.

1928
02:15:02,479 --> 02:15:05,680
Probably, I would say probably above, it's probably A.

1929
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:08,100
Tangerine gets to stay with orange

1930
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:10,180
because they have the gross sinew bullshit.

1931
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:11,859
Watermelon is A at least.

1932
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:16,119
I'm going to do melon F with cantaloupe.

1933
02:15:16,119 --> 02:15:17,520
Not as bad as grapefruit, though.

1934
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:19,770
I've never really had an Asian pear.

1935
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:21,579
I've never really had guava.

1936
02:15:22,220 --> 02:15:22,979
A lot of orange.

1937
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:25,619
It's kind of just like a grosser version of a grapefruit.

1938
02:15:25,819 --> 02:15:26,739
It's like just weird.

1939
02:15:26,939 --> 02:15:28,260
Like, I don't know.

1940
02:15:28,460 --> 02:15:29,619
It's like it's too deep.

1941
02:15:29,819 --> 02:15:33,000
It's too like it's too heavy.

1942
02:15:34,229 --> 02:15:37,510
Grapefruit, at least to me, has like that acidic taste.

1943
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:40,869
Blood orange has like the acidic taste and like the deep flavor.

1944
02:15:40,869 --> 02:15:41,470
I don't like it.

1945
02:15:43,060 --> 02:15:44,460
It's like an orange.

1946
02:15:44,659 --> 02:15:51,720
It's like the sinew of the of the orange and the grossness of the grapefruit to me.

1947
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:02,619
I mean, I like the flavor is there for me, but it's just like the combination

1948
02:16:02,819 --> 02:16:06,020
of how I don't like I don't like citrus fruits eating them like this,

1949
02:16:06,220 --> 02:16:08,260
unless I'm like going to bite into a lemon and be a weirdo.

1950
02:16:09,079 --> 02:16:14,380
The citrus fruits have all that gross shit in it, especially oranges and things

1951
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:18,720
in the orange family. Stop saying sinew.

1952
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:22,850
Like it's a cool new word that I found out.

1953
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:24,409
What is a custard apple?

1954
02:16:25,869 --> 02:16:27,510
I don't know. I never had a kumquat.

1955
02:16:27,710 --> 02:16:30,270
Never had a mulberry raisins.

1956
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:33,190
If I'm in the mood for it are very high, but you have to be in the mood for it.

1957
02:16:34,979 --> 02:16:37,219
Jackfruit.

1958
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:41,270
Have I ever had jackfruit? Maybe like once.

1959
02:16:41,469 --> 02:16:42,790
Sour cherry.

1960
02:16:42,989 --> 02:16:45,110
I don't I've not had really any of these.

1961
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:46,940
All right, let's get this right.

1962
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:56,540
Bananas are I don't know if I would.

1963
02:16:56,739 --> 02:16:58,059
Dragon fruit is like here.

1964
02:16:58,690 --> 02:16:59,850
Pineapple is higher than this.

1965
02:16:59,850 --> 02:17:00,729
Pineapple is probably here.

1966
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:05,399
I would I would rather just eat a bowl of pineapples.

1967
02:17:05,399 --> 02:17:07,680
I know it's got the bromelain in it, right?

1968
02:17:07,879 --> 02:17:10,559
It's kind of hurts your mouth after a while, but it's really good.

1969
02:17:13,239 --> 02:17:14,280
I'd rather have a nectarine.

1970
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:16,239
I'd rather have a nectarine.

1971
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:18,780
That's good.

1972
02:17:18,979 --> 02:17:20,579
You know, when you get a good nectarine,

1973
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:25,700
when you need a napkin in your other hand to take one bite because it's going to

1974
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:27,459
you're going to get sprayed with like a super soaker.

1975
02:17:27,899 --> 02:17:28,899
That's how you know it's a good one.

1976
02:17:33,629 --> 02:17:36,110
It's just one of it's just the it's arguably the best fruit.

1977
02:17:36,739 --> 02:17:42,979
But I like bananas flavor a little better.

1978
02:17:43,139 --> 02:17:45,100
Strawberry is no, it's not.

1979
02:17:46,379 --> 02:17:46,940
No, it's not.

1980
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:49,819
And you know why strawberry doesn't get to level up and strawberry might actually

1981
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:53,190
come down. How many times have you gotten strawberries?

1982
02:17:53,389 --> 02:17:55,430
And it's just texture.

1983
02:17:55,430 --> 02:17:57,389
There's just nothing there that you can't taste anything.

1984
02:17:58,790 --> 02:18:01,149
Oh, a strawberry bite.

1985
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:02,309
I don't you don't taste anything.

1986
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:07,059
It's just like you kind of can like smell strawberry, but you don't taste strawberry.

1987
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:14,530
I'm going to put them down here because they live in the same world.

1988
02:18:14,899 --> 02:18:20,649
They need to be really, really picked at the right time and in the right place

1989
02:18:21,110 --> 02:18:24,309
for them to taste the way and be texturally the way that I want them to be.

1990
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:26,879
So it has to come down here.

1991
02:18:33,719 --> 02:18:34,840
Green apple is so good.

1992
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:37,440
You know, it's funny about green apple.

1993
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:40,360
The only reason why I like green apple is because of Jolly Ranchers.

1994
02:18:41,889 --> 02:18:42,409
That's it.

1995
02:18:43,549 --> 02:18:46,190
When I was younger, I loved green apple,

1996
02:18:46,389 --> 02:18:49,430
Jolly Ranchers to a point that it made me want to eat the fruit.

1997
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:53,579
And ever since, it's been my favorite apple.

1998
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,319
Delicious is S tier.

1999
02:18:57,319 --> 02:18:57,840
Is that what you said?

2000
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:00,280
Because that's probably one of the most incorrect things I've ever heard.

2001
02:19:11,090 --> 02:19:13,450
There's no nutritional value in Las Vegas.

2002
02:19:15,549 --> 02:19:18,309
This is strawberries have the same problem everywhere.

2003
02:19:18,469 --> 02:19:21,270
Back when I was in Massachusetts, I had the same problem, too.

2004
02:19:22,799 --> 02:19:24,239
It's not like, oh, everything in Vegas is

2005
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:30,090
devoid of all flavor and all know what some of the best restaurants

2006
02:19:30,090 --> 02:19:32,370
in the world that I've ever been to have been here.

2007
02:19:33,260 --> 02:19:36,100
Excuse me, I'm going to have a reason to stay.

2008
02:19:40,629 --> 02:19:44,239
OK, kiwis are amazing.

2009
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:45,840
You know what I've come to realize?

2010
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:50,790
I love crunchy seeds that you can eat.

2011
02:19:51,489 --> 02:19:53,569
I love that texture of biting into a kiwi

2012
02:19:53,569 --> 02:19:56,170
and you get to the seed part and it's like that little crunch.

2013
02:19:56,860 --> 02:20:00,780
I love it.

2014
02:20:03,649 --> 02:20:05,409
I don't know, avocado shouldn't be on here.

2015
02:20:05,409 --> 02:20:08,889
I know it's a fruit, but it's not used the way that fruits are used.

2016
02:20:08,889 --> 02:20:10,049
I'm taking it off the list.

2017
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,770
Avocado is a vegetable and I know it's not.

2018
02:20:14,530 --> 02:20:16,489
I know, but I don't care.

2019
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:21,649
Avocado is like a tier in a vegetable list.

2020
02:20:24,010 --> 02:20:26,690
I don't put pineapple on my like cheeseburgers.

2021
02:20:27,959 --> 02:20:32,899
I don't put like I don't put like a slice of nectarine on like a sandwich.

2022
02:20:33,659 --> 02:20:42,399
I I'm I'm just saying that sounds good.

2023
02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:43,760
It's literally not a vegetable, though.

2024
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:45,159
And where's tomato then?

2025
02:20:45,729 --> 02:20:47,409
Show me the tomato. Where's the tomato?

2026
02:20:49,829 --> 02:20:50,590
Where's the tomato?

2027
02:20:53,809 --> 02:20:55,969
You want to fight semantics on me here?

2028
02:20:56,860 --> 02:20:57,739
Find me the tomato.

2029
02:21:05,860 --> 02:21:06,940
Fine, it'll fine.

2030
02:21:07,139 --> 02:21:07,940
It stays up here.

2031
02:21:14,139 --> 02:21:19,239
I would probably rather eat an apple than an orange, a red apple.

2032
02:21:22,690 --> 02:21:25,530
Little Macintosh apples are amazing, but nobody fucking has them.

2033
02:21:25,530 --> 02:21:27,129
Nobody sells them. I don't know why.

2034
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:31,959
Why? How come I've not why have I not been

2035
02:21:32,159 --> 02:21:36,280
able to find a Macintosh little apple in like the last five years?

2036
02:21:36,659 --> 02:21:37,940
Why? They're better.

2037
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:38,620
They're the best.

2038
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:44,409
Now, even when I was in Massachusetts, I couldn't find them.

2039
02:21:52,399 --> 02:21:53,840
I love Macintosh apples.

2040
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:55,520
They're the only red apple I like.

2041
02:21:56,690 --> 02:21:58,129
OK, I think this is good.

2042
02:21:59,530 --> 02:22:02,420
I'm happy with this lemon lime.

2043
02:22:02,620 --> 02:22:04,260
It's just it goes on everything.

2044
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:05,219
It goes well in everything.

2045
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:10,459
Lemon water, lemon candies, lemon, like a slice of lemon on something

2046
02:22:10,659 --> 02:22:12,340
like a squeeze of lime on stuff.

2047
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,920
I mean, it's like you can't beat it.

2048
02:22:17,639 --> 02:22:18,520
I think this is good.

2049
02:22:18,719 --> 02:22:20,680
I'd rather have a nectarine than eating a banana.

2050
02:22:23,940 --> 02:22:24,500
There it is.

2051
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:31,760
You just proved your avocado point wrong with lemon and lime.

2052
02:22:39,430 --> 02:22:49,930
What do you mean? Macintosh suck so bad.

2053
02:22:50,129 --> 02:22:51,450
I'm still not over that.

2054
02:22:51,649 --> 02:22:57,389
It's fucking I love it.

2055
02:22:58,090 --> 02:23:00,090
Would you just eat a lemon or a lime?

2056
02:23:00,290 --> 02:23:02,899
Yes.

2057
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:04,819
Every time that there's a lemon or a lime

2058
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:08,540
from a restaurant that they put on the side or something, I always just go

2059
02:23:10,709 --> 02:23:16,659
every time I love it, prove it.

2060
02:23:18,309 --> 02:23:19,549
Do you really want me to prove this by

2061
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:22,430
like biting into and like enjoying a lime on stream?

2062
02:23:22,629 --> 02:23:23,590
That's not hard to do.

2063
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:24,309
That's very easy.

2064
02:23:24,510 --> 02:23:25,870
That's a very easy thing to do.

2065
02:23:28,549 --> 02:23:32,030
It's not like eating a raw onion.

2066
02:23:32,229 --> 02:23:35,809
Limes are not as harsh as a lemon is.

2067
02:23:36,010 --> 02:23:38,969
It's not like biting into like an onion.

2068
02:23:47,469 --> 02:23:48,270
OK, here you go.

2069
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:49,309
Let's move on to the next one.

2070
02:23:49,389 --> 02:23:50,549
We did that one. We did that one quick.

2071
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:52,479
That's good. All right.

2072
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:56,000
This is a American Mammals tier list.

2073
02:23:57,459 --> 02:23:58,500
Why am I even doing this one?

2074
02:23:58,700 --> 02:23:59,780
Who cares?

2075
02:23:59,979 --> 02:24:01,139
Who gives a shit?

2076
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:07,100
Who actually gives a shit about this one?

2077
02:24:07,299 --> 02:24:08,940
You know what I mean? Like, who cares?

2078
02:24:12,649 --> 02:24:14,329
All right. How about we need some music?

2079
02:24:14,329 --> 02:24:15,569
We could use some music.

2080
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:22,829
What's an OST you want to hear?

2081
02:24:29,479 --> 02:24:31,200
Mario Party OST.

2082
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:36,020
But Deltarune. Oh, yeah, it's not bad.

2083
02:24:36,219 --> 02:24:37,299
It's not a bad one.

2084
02:24:39,219 --> 02:24:44,200
It's not a bad one.

2085
02:24:49,309 --> 02:24:49,790
All right.

2086
02:24:50,770 --> 02:24:52,809
It's got a nice and low just in the background.

2087
02:24:52,809 --> 02:24:54,129
We don't need to be loud.

2088
02:24:55,079 --> 02:24:56,319
It's a good shell in the background.

2089
02:24:56,319 --> 02:24:57,280
You know what I'm saying?

2090
02:24:57,479 --> 02:25:01,639
You know what I mean, Bird?

2091
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:02,959
Let's continue.

2092
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:05,389
Armadillo is Est here.

2093
02:25:05,590 --> 02:25:07,549
It's just what a cool animal.

2094
02:25:08,819 --> 02:25:11,850
Uh, Badger.

2095
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:16,399
OK, wait, what's the criteria here, though?

2096
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:22,420
Is it animals that I think are like cool, that I think are cool?

2097
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:24,379
Or what's like the strongest one?

2098
02:25:24,579 --> 02:25:28,979
Just coolness factor. OK, I can do coolness factor.

2099
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:30,840
About all right.

2100
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:32,700
That's a pretty cool.

2101
02:25:33,399 --> 02:25:35,520
They're very cool, actually.

2102
02:25:37,459 --> 02:25:39,979
My dad is the only person other than you that says,

2103
02:25:41,190 --> 02:25:43,370
you know what I mean, Vern?

2104
02:25:43,569 --> 02:25:45,969
Well, your father is a hyper intelligent

2105
02:25:46,170 --> 02:25:49,370
individual who consumed countless hours of earnest.

2106
02:25:49,569 --> 02:25:55,940
So that's your dad is a very smart person.

2107
02:25:56,139 --> 02:25:57,260
Beaver.

2108
02:25:57,459 --> 02:25:59,579
Beaver, I would say probably be a beater.

2109
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:02,260
Sheep, bighorn sheep, see?

2110
02:26:02,639 --> 02:26:04,559
Bisons, they're like big and cool.

2111
02:26:04,719 --> 02:26:07,280
Black Bear's ass, they're the cutest things in the world.

2112
02:26:08,549 --> 02:26:11,229
They're just so I just run through of Otto.

2113
02:26:13,530 --> 02:26:15,329
Bobcat.

2114
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:16,370
Hi, B.

2115
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:21,059
Caribou, C. Chipmunk is A just because it's

2116
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:24,059
fun to watch them kind of scurry around and stuff.

2117
02:26:24,260 --> 02:26:30,260
Yeah. Iotis, B. Deer, B.

2118
02:26:30,459 --> 02:26:34,569
Well, baby deer is like holy shit.

2119
02:26:34,770 --> 02:26:38,489
What an adorable like the world is at peace right now.

2120
02:26:38,489 --> 02:26:39,770
When you look at like a baby deer.

2121
02:26:40,229 --> 02:26:51,229
But dolphins, dolphins are kind of cool.

2122
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:53,950
I have all the horned

2123
02:26:54,149 --> 02:26:56,229
mammals that then come down to about C for me.

2124
02:26:59,229 --> 02:27:02,389
Fox, I feel like is S tier for too many people, which I'm a contrarian.

2125
02:27:02,389 --> 02:27:06,219
So I'm going to put it down at C because I can't like the thing that everybody else

2126
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:09,540
likes because I how could I I can't I have to be the contrarian.

2127
02:27:10,430 --> 02:27:11,829
I like armadillos. I'm different.

2128
02:27:11,829 --> 02:27:14,469
I'm not like I'm not like everybody else.

2129
02:27:14,670 --> 02:27:15,549
Gophers are funny.

2130
02:27:17,079 --> 02:27:22,659
Grizzly bears are just huge grizzly bears are the bear of the bear world, I think.

2131
02:27:24,129 --> 02:27:25,450
So they get to be a pretty high.

2132
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:29,899
Groundhogs and gophers are just like the same animal in my head.

2133
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:33,299
So I don't even know what that is.

2134
02:27:35,729 --> 02:27:38,969
A javelina was a javelina.

2135
02:27:42,930 --> 02:27:45,299
Manatee is pretty high.

2136
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:47,020
We might upgrade the manatee.

2137
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:51,399
A marmot.

2138
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:56,209
It's kind of like a beaver. Martin is kind of like a it's like a ferret.

2139
02:27:57,030 --> 02:27:58,469
Moles are S tier.

2140
02:27:58,469 --> 02:27:59,229
They're so weird.

2141
02:27:59,430 --> 02:28:00,629
What a strange animal.

2142
02:28:03,180 --> 02:28:05,100
Moose get to upgrade from the horned

2143
02:28:05,299 --> 02:28:08,299
animals list up to summer and B because they're just so huge.

2144
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:09,459
They're massive.

2145
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:10,340
It's interesting.

2146
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:13,840
What is that?

2147
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:14,959
What the fuck is that?

2148
02:28:15,159 --> 02:28:16,559
I thought that was a dog.

2149
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:23,450
That looks like somebody drew like a Chad Brian the dog.

2150
02:28:24,459 --> 02:28:29,739
It's a mountain goat.

2151
02:28:29,940 --> 02:28:32,340
Why does it look so photoshopped?

2152
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:37,239
Mountain lion.

2153
02:28:37,239 --> 02:28:38,600
You guys can hang out in the same place.

2154
02:28:38,979 --> 02:28:39,700
Mouse.

2155
02:28:40,579 --> 02:28:42,399
A tier. I love mice.

2156
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:43,760
I love mice and I love rats.

2157
02:28:45,610 --> 02:28:46,930
Oh, a musk of the musk rat.

2158
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:51,680
Kind of cool. Possums are weird.

2159
02:28:51,879 --> 02:28:54,159
Like so it's too weird to not be S.

2160
02:28:58,819 --> 02:28:59,700
I love otters.

2161
02:28:59,899 --> 02:29:00,860
I love when they go like this.

2162
02:29:05,209 --> 02:29:05,770
I love. Yeah.

2163
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:13,889
They just because of this is the reason why they're up here.

2164
02:29:16,819 --> 02:29:19,020
I mean, like the sea mammals are really cool.

2165
02:29:19,219 --> 02:29:24,469
Whales go up really high just because this thing is just how does it even exist?

2166
02:29:24,469 --> 02:29:25,270
This is a dinosaur.

2167
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:30,639
We have so many weird.

2168
02:29:30,639 --> 02:29:33,159
And OK, when people talk about I wonder what they imagine,

2169
02:29:33,360 --> 02:29:35,680
like how crazy shit would look on other planets.

2170
02:29:36,379 --> 02:29:39,260
Wow, like how fucked up and crazy would the animals be?

2171
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:41,579
They'd have like antennas coming out of their heads.

2172
02:29:41,780 --> 02:29:45,809
They'd be this is look at a whale, look at like a big blue whale.

2173
02:29:45,969 --> 02:29:48,049
And you try to tell me that that wouldn't

2174
02:29:48,250 --> 02:29:51,530
be insane to see that if you were from another planet.

2175
02:29:52,479 --> 02:29:57,260
They're a big floating mass of just like soft tissue.

2176
02:29:57,459 --> 02:30:02,260
And they have these huge, huge like Muppet Mouse that go like

2177
02:30:03,979 --> 02:30:06,459
it's they're completely strange.

2178
02:30:06,659 --> 02:30:07,659
They're abnormal.

2179
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:08,940
They're not from Earth.

2180
02:30:11,620 --> 02:30:13,420
They're like living machines in a way.

2181
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:16,819
They're just giant hulking like monolith machines.

2182
02:30:17,020 --> 02:30:18,100
It's crazy.

2183
02:30:18,299 --> 02:30:19,459
They belong in us.

2184
02:30:23,950 --> 02:30:27,850
Why you cut my mic? Why?

2185
02:30:28,049 --> 02:30:29,770
That's kind of cool. Whatever that is.

2186
02:30:30,270 --> 02:30:31,829
Orcupine is kind of cool.

2187
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:36,479
Furry dogs are kind of like, hmm, they're all right.

2188
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:40,479
It's kind of like another dog with horns.

2189
02:30:41,430 --> 02:30:43,069
This is a German shepherd with horns.

2190
02:30:43,270 --> 02:30:46,180
What is this? A pronghorn?

2191
02:30:48,149 --> 02:30:49,510
Rabbits are pretty cool.

2192
02:30:50,530 --> 02:30:52,049
Raccoons are really cool.

2193
02:30:53,260 --> 02:30:54,180
Rats are rest here.

2194
02:30:54,379 --> 02:30:56,500
We'll mess with this in a little bit.

2195
02:30:56,700 --> 02:30:57,979
This thing's kind of cool.

2196
02:30:58,350 --> 02:30:59,750
Sea lions are kind of cool.

2197
02:31:01,469 --> 02:31:03,350
Seals are kind of, seals are all right.

2198
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:07,549
I like when they go like this and their whole head kind of stuffs into their neck.

2199
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:11,159
A shrew. Oh, yeah. Shrew is up here.

2200
02:31:12,049 --> 02:31:13,610
Skunks are fun.

2201
02:31:14,559 --> 02:31:18,840
Squirrels are cool, but it's just like it's an oversaturated market for squirrels.

2202
02:31:18,840 --> 02:31:19,440
You know what I mean?

2203
02:31:19,639 --> 02:31:21,559
It's not interesting to see a squirrel,

2204
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:24,000
even though they're really cool and they're really funny.

2205
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:30,100
It's a very oversaturated market, I think.

2206
02:31:30,299 --> 02:31:31,500
Vols are cool.

2207
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:33,260
I don't know if they're est here, though.

2208
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:36,629
Weasels are est here.

2209
02:31:37,709 --> 02:31:39,989
Walruses are kind of like, I don't know, weird to me.

2210
02:31:40,030 --> 02:31:42,229
Wolf is, I mean, it's just like so easy.

2211
02:31:42,860 --> 02:31:44,940
Wolverine is just so angry, it's funny.

2212
02:31:45,379 --> 02:31:49,090
OK, let's get this accurate.

2213
02:31:54,329 --> 02:31:55,610
Which one is your fursona?

2214
02:31:55,979 --> 02:31:57,059
It's one of these in est here.

2215
02:31:59,870 --> 02:32:01,750
Armadillo versus rat.

2216
02:32:02,829 --> 02:32:04,709
Armadillo versus otter.

2217
02:32:04,909 --> 02:32:06,229
Yeah, Armadillo is cool.

2218
02:32:09,100 --> 02:32:11,340
I think skunks are funnier than black bears.

2219
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:16,500
I don't know why. Mole, weasel, possum.

2220
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,719
Whale, I think, comes up high like here.

2221
02:32:22,979 --> 02:32:27,549
All right. Mouse, antity, chipmunk.

2222
02:32:29,020 --> 02:32:31,059
Orca, orca and whale.

2223
02:32:31,940 --> 02:32:33,219
It's just so huge and hulking.

2224
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:34,579
It's so interesting.

2225
02:32:36,879 --> 02:32:38,559
Where's Wolverine? Wolverine has to come up.

2226
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:47,100
Yeah, well, that's not fair.

2227
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:50,420
I'm basing the opinion of bringing the fox up,

2228
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:52,219
not because I want to be the contrarian,

2229
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:55,059
but because of that video of the fox going like,

2230
02:32:58,510 --> 02:33:00,229
that's such a cute video.

2231
02:33:00,430 --> 02:33:01,149
I love it.

2232
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:04,420
It's like one of the cutest videos ever.

2233
02:33:05,299 --> 02:33:08,940
The fox is so happy and just like, it's like,

2234
02:33:09,139 --> 02:33:14,940
man, it starts like just making noise and it's so happy.

2235
02:33:15,059 --> 02:33:19,700
They're about to get a treat and they're just like, oh, my God, yay.

2236
02:33:24,690 --> 02:33:27,170
What do you mean, what? You guys have not seen that video?

2237
02:33:31,450 --> 02:33:32,370
The video is so good.

2238
02:33:32,370 --> 02:33:34,450
Yeah. How many of you guys have not seen that video?

2239
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:38,239
I'm supposed to be the one that doesn't know anything about the Internet.

2240
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:40,040
You guys are supposed to know all this.

2241
02:33:44,899 --> 02:33:46,700
OK, rabbit. Yeah, I think this is good.

2242
02:33:46,899 --> 02:33:47,860
I don't think I need to change anything.

2243
02:33:48,059 --> 02:33:50,860
You can probably tell that I think most of the animals and horns are kind

2244
02:33:51,059 --> 02:33:52,659
of interesting, but not really.

2245
02:33:54,379 --> 02:33:55,739
They always do this.

2246
02:33:55,940 --> 02:34:01,319
OK, the horned animals are like the Ford truck commercial

2247
02:34:01,319 --> 02:34:02,760
of the animal world.

2248
02:34:02,959 --> 02:34:07,559
They always have they always take the same picture of them sideways turned head,

2249
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:12,600
like looking in the camera, like sideways profile head turned.

2250
02:34:16,110 --> 02:34:18,389
It's I feel like it's like a car commercial.

2251
02:34:18,590 --> 02:34:19,590
It's just a model pose.

2252
02:34:19,790 --> 02:34:23,729
Yeah, I think my drink is leaking.

2253
02:34:23,930 --> 02:34:25,370
You just have to drink it faster.

2254
02:34:27,020 --> 02:34:28,860
Oh, American made.

2255
02:34:29,940 --> 02:34:31,620
Yeah, this is what I think of.

2256
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:38,260
These things are going to start to leak.

2257
02:34:39,149 --> 02:34:40,829
It's starting to kind of compress on itself.

2258
02:34:41,030 --> 02:34:41,950
I don't know why.

2259
02:34:42,520 --> 02:34:43,680
All right, there you go.

2260
02:34:47,469 --> 02:34:48,190
Animal tearless.

2261
02:34:48,389 --> 02:34:53,430
That means my fursona is an armadillo or a rat or an otter or a skunk.

2262
02:34:54,770 --> 02:34:55,770
I don't want to be a skunk, though.

2263
02:34:55,969 --> 02:34:57,329
I think I would be an armadillo.

2264
02:34:59,430 --> 02:35:00,270
What's next?

2265
02:35:00,709 --> 02:35:03,909
Uh, he's a fast food mascots.

2266
02:35:04,110 --> 02:35:05,469
I could beat in a fight.

2267
02:35:12,819 --> 02:35:18,799
OK, well, I'm going to tell you right off the bat, I'm just going to stomp this guy.

2268
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,799
You know what I mean? I'm just one shoe print is going to instantly kill

2269
02:35:22,799 --> 02:35:24,840
and break every bone in this thing's body.

2270
02:35:26,069 --> 02:35:27,309
This is going to be like

2271
02:35:27,510 --> 02:35:29,709
this and it's going to be squished.

2272
02:35:32,329 --> 02:35:33,530
So that's guaranteed.

2273
02:35:36,459 --> 02:35:37,819
Wendy, I'm not so sure.

2274
02:35:38,459 --> 02:35:40,260
I think I get I think I get beat up, Wendy.

2275
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:41,399
Hmm.

2276
02:35:42,540 --> 02:35:43,739
You might kick the shit out of me, though.

2277
02:35:50,579 --> 02:35:53,540
I feel like I would I might actually get my ass kicked from Wendy.

2278
02:35:56,350 --> 02:35:59,229
I would not be prepared for what Wendy would do.

2279
02:35:59,430 --> 02:36:02,510
Like, I feel like she would come with like a fucking pitchfork or something.

2280
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:10,040
Wendy's 12.

2281
02:36:17,899 --> 02:36:21,059
Well, what would you like me to say about the baby then?

2282
02:36:21,260 --> 02:36:23,739
What do you want to say about the baby?

2283
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:30,819
What should we say about the bit, the literal infant baby on this list?

2284
02:36:31,020 --> 02:36:42,569
OK, this guy's going to kill me.

2285
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:44,090
I'm just I've already died.

2286
02:36:44,290 --> 02:36:46,370
The Quaker Road guys fucking kill me.

2287
02:36:47,510 --> 02:36:49,469
Why and punch? I'm just going through the happily.

2288
02:36:49,670 --> 02:36:52,750
OK, the Happy Meal Guy, the Happy Meal Guy.

2289
02:36:52,950 --> 02:37:00,969
I would just go like this and like fold them and just crush them.

2290
02:37:01,170 --> 02:37:02,409
This flight involved here.

2291
02:37:02,610 --> 02:37:04,489
I don't like I love bees.

2292
02:37:04,489 --> 02:37:05,889
I love what they do for the environment.

2293
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:08,729
I need to protect bees at all costs.

2294
02:37:08,889 --> 02:37:15,540
But if one bee gets like too close to me, I'm going to go like this and fucking run.

2295
02:37:15,739 --> 02:37:17,540
So I don't know.

2296
02:37:17,739 --> 02:37:19,299
I'm not sure if I would be able to do it.

2297
02:37:23,319 --> 02:37:29,959
These these these three little guys here, they could they could be anywhere.

2298
02:37:30,530 --> 02:37:35,569
I feel like this big like this big and they OK, not only are they small,

2299
02:37:36,010 --> 02:37:39,409
but they have like sentience, like human sentience.

2300
02:37:39,610 --> 02:37:41,409
They're like intelligent beings, right?

2301
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:44,600
They could literally just poison my drink.

2302
02:37:47,409 --> 02:37:51,049
Yeah, they could come in with like a cyanide capsule and fucking just like

2303
02:37:51,129 --> 02:37:53,889
heave it up there, get up there and dump it into like my coffee.

2304
02:37:54,090 --> 02:37:55,530
I would lose. Absolutely.

2305
02:37:58,459 --> 02:38:00,979
Tony the Tiger is not is not going to be a fight.

2306
02:38:02,899 --> 02:38:04,540
Tony the Tiger would destroy me.

2307
02:38:11,500 --> 02:38:14,500
OK, this is like a this is like a old revolutionary guy, right?

2308
02:38:14,500 --> 02:38:15,899
I feel like this guy would just shoot me.

2309
02:38:18,649 --> 02:38:18,969
Chuck E.

2310
02:38:19,170 --> 02:38:20,329
Cheese, that's a fair fight.

2311
02:38:24,159 --> 02:38:26,159
Why is the jelly bean even on this list?

2312
02:38:28,389 --> 02:38:30,909
You it would be I would just eat them.

2313
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:33,500
It's like, oh, you are you want to fight?

2314
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:37,399
And then I go, oh, you were popcorn.

2315
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:43,260
Oh, Bakers were pacifists.

2316
02:38:43,459 --> 02:38:49,010
Wait, they were. Oh, I'm getting deja vu.

2317
02:38:49,010 --> 02:38:57,299
Do we have the same conversation like three years ago?

2318
02:38:57,500 --> 02:38:59,520
We did the same thing.

2319
02:39:01,049 --> 02:39:02,889
We did the same thing.

2320
02:39:04,030 --> 02:39:05,469
Did I do the same list?

2321
02:39:05,469 --> 02:39:07,309
Why am I acting like this is so different?

2322
02:39:09,610 --> 02:39:12,569
Mr. Peanut, easy.

2323
02:39:16,209 --> 02:39:18,729
Grimace, this is I don't know, Grimace.

2324
02:39:18,930 --> 02:39:21,729
Grimace, I feel like doesn't have very much access to his hands.

2325
02:39:21,930 --> 02:39:25,450
So all it would take would be like a full sprint drop kick right into his stomach

2326
02:39:25,489 --> 02:39:28,049
and he would just tumble off a cliff and he'd be over.

2327
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:35,319
So I think I would I would think I would destroy Grimace.

2328
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:36,840
Hmm.

2329
02:39:49,309 --> 02:39:54,149
I could beat I could be I could absolutely be the Lucky Charms leprechaun.

2330
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:58,620
Again, we have the same problem here.

2331
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:03,010
The same problem here. I could just get poisoned.

2332
02:40:03,209 --> 02:40:04,569
I could just get poisoned.

2333
02:40:04,770 --> 02:40:06,129
It's just a cyanide pill.

2334
02:40:06,329 --> 02:40:07,690
They're like this tall, right?

2335
02:40:12,540 --> 02:40:13,899
I would be in big trouble.

2336
02:40:14,920 --> 02:40:16,319
Poison isn't a fight.

2337
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:17,520
What do you mean?

2338
02:40:21,290 --> 02:40:23,329
I was wait, it's not which one of these

2339
02:40:23,329 --> 02:40:25,329
could like murder you in your sleep.

2340
02:40:25,530 --> 02:40:26,489
It's fight.

2341
02:40:26,989 --> 02:40:35,319
Oh, oh, OK.

2342
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:38,639
Then, yeah, I would just it would be pretty easy.

2343
02:40:42,790 --> 02:40:44,510
I guess that would be very easy.

2344
02:40:45,719 --> 02:40:47,799
What's the point of this whole list?

2345
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:55,370
This is an old man like

2346
02:40:55,569 --> 02:40:57,969
nobody on this list could stand a chance

2347
02:40:58,170 --> 02:41:01,090
besides Tony the Tiger and maybe Chef Boyardee.

2348
02:41:05,690 --> 02:41:08,170
You can't say he has flight, which is very important.

2349
02:41:09,819 --> 02:41:13,819
This is just another another like this is like another little kid.

2350
02:41:14,709 --> 02:41:16,309
What's the difference between these two?

2351
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:26,440
What's the difference? We already did this.

2352
02:41:26,639 --> 02:41:29,030
I don't need to do this again.

2353
02:41:29,229 --> 02:41:30,030
This is a cow.

2354
02:41:30,229 --> 02:41:34,540
So I don't I mean, I feel like I could get like really fucked up.

2355
02:41:36,389 --> 02:41:40,360
This is a this is a cheetah, which I would be.

2356
02:41:40,559 --> 02:41:43,200
All right. What's more dangerous, a tiger or a cheetah?

2357
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:46,170
By the way, like a cracked out cheetah.

2358
02:41:47,950 --> 02:41:52,389
Tony the Tiger is like fit and he wants to help and he wants you to go

2359
02:41:52,590 --> 02:41:56,149
and have a great time and go out inside and play soccer.

2360
02:41:56,790 --> 02:41:58,309
This guy's like Cheetos.

2361
02:41:58,510 --> 02:42:00,750
Yeah, like this guy's fucked.

2362
02:42:01,450 --> 02:42:06,780
I don't know about this guy junk food, motherfuckers like this.

2363
02:42:06,979 --> 02:42:09,219
Yeah, this guy's an absolute this is mayhem.

2364
02:42:09,420 --> 02:42:11,459
I would be this is S tier for sure.

2365
02:42:19,139 --> 02:42:19,860
Who's this?

2366
02:42:20,059 --> 02:42:23,340
I mean, I would I would annihilate you.

2367
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:25,020
This is the Taco Bell dog.

2368
02:42:25,899 --> 02:42:29,739
This is very important because there is a very high chance that they could be

2369
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:33,299
a 90s comedy scene where he like bites my balls.

2370
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:37,670
Right. And I got to be like, oh, the dog that this could be very, very difficult.

2371
02:42:45,149 --> 02:42:46,469
Keebler elves goodbye.

2372
02:42:46,670 --> 02:42:47,670
Eminem's goodbye.

2373
02:42:47,870 --> 02:42:49,790
They're just like they're like an inch tall.

2374
02:42:51,829 --> 02:42:53,030
Why are you on here twice?

2375
02:42:53,229 --> 02:42:56,549
I would kill both hands, your left and your right.

2376
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:01,420
Ronald McDonald, I would put up here.

2377
02:43:01,989 --> 02:43:05,340
Yeah, I don't know why.

2378
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:09,500
I'm just imagining Ronald McDonald with a pissed face

2379
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:14,090
in like in like a candid TikTok video for some reason,

2380
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:17,750
like just slapping me in the fucking face,

2381
02:43:18,579 --> 02:43:21,100
like on like somebody's filming it like on TikTok or something.

2382
02:43:21,559 --> 02:43:23,559
Like I'm just I don't know why I just imagining me sitting there like,

2383
02:43:23,559 --> 02:43:24,639
fuck you, you piece of shit.

2384
02:43:24,840 --> 02:43:27,620
And he just goes like, and I go up.

2385
02:43:30,100 --> 02:43:31,700
Yeah. So he'd win.

2386
02:43:33,229 --> 02:43:40,479
He would kick the shit out of me because this happened.

2387
02:43:51,670 --> 02:43:56,629
Oh, the Kool-Aid man, I he's got size,

2388
02:43:56,829 --> 02:44:00,590
but I would absolutely beat them because he just made it a glass.

2389
02:44:02,379 --> 02:44:05,299
I would just pick up a rock and throw it as hard as I could.

2390
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:14,090
And it would just Kool-Aid man is also like cracked out.

2391
02:44:14,290 --> 02:44:15,090
It doesn't know.

2392
02:44:15,290 --> 02:44:17,170
But the Kool-Aid man's made it a glass.

2393
02:44:19,340 --> 02:44:21,059
He's made it a bulletproof glass.

2394
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:24,649
Where do you who said that he breaks through walls?

2395
02:44:24,850 --> 02:44:26,049
Oh, shit, he does.

2396
02:44:26,250 --> 02:44:28,090
That's a that's a big problem.

2397
02:44:36,209 --> 02:44:39,610
I feel like like the Hawaiian punch in the stomach would probably hurt.

2398
02:44:39,610 --> 02:44:42,489
But that would just probably just drop, kick him after that.

2399
02:44:46,510 --> 02:44:47,629
I think I could do it.

2400
02:44:48,459 --> 02:44:50,860
Oh, here's another like this is not like racked out guy.

2401
02:44:50,860 --> 02:44:51,940
You know what I mean?

2402
02:44:53,139 --> 02:44:55,700
I don't know if he's higher that he's up here.

2403
02:44:57,360 --> 02:45:00,159
This is somebody that when they eat chocolate, they turn to like it's like

2404
02:45:00,360 --> 02:45:01,799
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

2405
02:45:03,219 --> 02:45:06,500
So if I kept chocolate away from the cocoa puffs bird,

2406
02:45:06,700 --> 02:45:08,059
I think I would be able to do it.

2407
02:45:08,260 --> 02:45:10,379
But if he like Popeye, the sailor man,

2408
02:45:10,579 --> 02:45:15,780
spinach like crushed like a chocolate bar in his mouth, I'm going to run.

2409
02:45:18,520 --> 02:45:20,200
That's up in the air. I'm not sure.

2410
02:45:24,989 --> 02:45:26,270
Sun of raisins.

2411
02:45:26,469 --> 02:45:32,889
OK, I think that'd be pretty.

2412
02:45:33,090 --> 02:45:34,049
Hmm.

2413
02:45:44,540 --> 02:45:45,420
Farmers are ripped.

2414
02:45:45,620 --> 02:45:48,379
Yeah, that's why I'm sitting here thinking about this.

2415
02:45:56,370 --> 02:45:59,049
But you're like out in like the sun.

2416
02:45:59,049 --> 02:46:01,010
You're out like where you're doing stuff.

2417
02:46:01,010 --> 02:46:06,409
I'm such like a soft, supple, like fucking blob person at this point.

2418
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:09,680
I would probably crumble in one fucking hit.

2419
02:46:12,229 --> 02:46:15,629
I have like my stomach like is

2420
02:46:16,010 --> 02:46:18,610
made out of it's like shakes now.

2421
02:46:26,920 --> 02:46:33,090
I would probably lose.

2422
02:46:33,290 --> 02:46:43,260
It would probably lose, especially if you caught me on like you're dead.

2423
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:46,760
No, it would be fair. It would be a fair fight.

2424
02:46:46,799 --> 02:46:47,520
No, it wouldn't.

2425
02:46:56,979 --> 02:46:59,340
You're supple. Well, I mean, just like my supple.

2426
02:46:59,540 --> 02:47:01,700
What I don't have words to describe.

2427
02:47:02,719 --> 02:47:03,799
There you go.

2428
02:47:04,750 --> 02:47:10,469
Is the list of food mascots I could beat in a fight a tier list maker.

2429
02:47:14,049 --> 02:47:15,930
M&Ms are human sized.

2430
02:47:16,559 --> 02:47:17,680
No, they're not.

2431
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:21,159
What are you talking about?

2432
02:47:21,360 --> 02:47:24,000
A human sized M&M is just grimace.

2433
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,159
That's not what you know.

2434
02:47:25,360 --> 02:47:26,559
That's wrong. What?

2435
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:28,319
No, it's not.

2436
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:33,540
He does exist.

2437
02:47:33,739 --> 02:47:35,379
They do exist.

2438
02:47:35,579 --> 02:47:37,620
They're like up to his shin.

2439
02:47:37,819 --> 02:47:39,659
They're not even up to his knees, guys.

2440
02:47:39,739 --> 02:47:41,579
In that Santa Claus commercial.

2441
02:47:41,780 --> 02:47:43,500
What are you talking about?

2442
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:45,659
They're not human size.

2443
02:47:45,860 --> 02:47:48,579
They're tiny. They're like two feet tall.

2444
02:47:52,670 --> 02:47:53,549
Santa's huge.

2445
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:57,219
Santa's not like 15 feet tall.

2446
02:47:57,420 --> 02:47:58,420
Sorry, Santa.

2447
02:47:58,620 --> 02:48:00,020
Santa's not as tall as a monster.

2448
02:48:00,219 --> 02:48:02,180
OK, Santa's not as tall as a monster.

2449
02:48:02,379 --> 02:48:03,379
All right.

2450
02:48:03,879 --> 02:48:04,879
Come on.

2451
02:48:05,079 --> 02:48:06,360
You guys trying to say that?

2452
02:48:08,340 --> 02:48:10,899
Yes, he is. Santa is not fucking 30 feet tall.

2453
02:48:13,959 --> 02:48:15,040
No, he's not.

2454
02:48:15,610 --> 02:48:17,489
I'm going to write how tall is.

2455
02:48:17,989 --> 02:48:20,989
How tall is Santa?

2456
02:48:25,780 --> 02:48:36,540
How tall is he? He's 6'6".

2457
02:48:36,739 --> 02:48:38,860
OK, but if you're 6'6",

2458
02:48:39,059 --> 02:48:42,899
somebody that's of M&M's come up to his shins.

2459
02:48:43,719 --> 02:48:46,680
We're watching that fucking commercial and I'm going to put this to rest.

2460
02:48:53,780 --> 02:48:55,059
Oh, yeah, they're human sized.

2461
02:48:55,059 --> 02:48:57,659
They're not even to the base of the Christmas tree.

2462
02:49:08,850 --> 02:49:11,739
This ad is not canon.

2463
02:49:11,940 --> 02:49:15,239
Oh, please.

2464
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:16,639
I'm putting it on here.

2465
02:49:18,489 --> 02:49:19,770
What do you mean not canon?

2466
02:49:26,860 --> 02:49:28,639
You guys ready?

2467
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:49,700
Don't listen to that ad.

2468
02:49:50,940 --> 02:49:54,500
OK, you ready?

2469
02:50:00,450 --> 02:50:01,930
Look at them. It's a pissed eye look.

2470
02:50:01,930 --> 02:50:08,069
I'm like, all right, we're going to watch this

2471
02:50:08,069 --> 02:50:11,190
because I want to prove once and for all that you guys are completely wrong.

2472
02:50:14,959 --> 02:50:17,379
So what we have here.

2473
02:50:17,579 --> 02:50:19,540
Stop. Can you see it?

2474
02:50:19,540 --> 02:50:20,620
No, you can't see it.

2475
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:37,729
Let's find out how tall the M&M's are.

2476
02:50:39,450 --> 02:50:40,370
I don't know.

2477
02:50:40,569 --> 02:50:42,610
I never met the guy.

2478
02:50:42,979 --> 02:50:44,219
OK,

2479
02:50:44,420 --> 02:50:49,620
explain to me how this guy that's 6'6", he's six feet tall, six and a half feet

2480
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:57,549
tall. So if you go up one foot or these guys are like maybe nine to ten,

2481
02:50:57,750 --> 02:51:04,159
like 12 inches tall.

2482
02:51:04,360 --> 02:51:06,040
We exist.

2483
02:51:07,819 --> 02:51:13,260
And by the way, all it took was for them to see Santa Claus and he fainted.

2484
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:16,760
I would kick the shit out of these two.

2485
02:51:17,579 --> 02:51:20,180
Are you kidding me? Imagine meeting German 985.

2486
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:22,760
Imagine you meet me.

2487
02:51:23,329 --> 02:51:24,809
Well, German 985.

2488
02:51:25,010 --> 02:51:35,180
Oh, I rest my case.

2489
02:51:35,379 --> 02:51:45,059
So, oh, my God, he does exist.

2490
02:51:45,219 --> 02:51:46,620
Do exist.

2491
02:51:50,579 --> 02:51:52,219
That's what I would do. I wouldn't faint.

2492
02:52:01,690 --> 02:52:02,850
Why is it so bright in my room?

2493
02:52:02,850 --> 02:52:03,770
I hate cameras.

2494
02:52:17,780 --> 02:52:19,139
All right, we did this.

2495
02:52:19,340 --> 02:52:22,379
Let's go. This one is Super Mario characters.

2496
02:52:22,579 --> 02:52:24,219
Every one tier list.

2497
02:52:26,770 --> 02:52:35,129
I'm not doing this. This is too much.

2498
02:52:35,329 --> 02:52:36,610
This is so many.

2499
02:52:38,459 --> 02:52:39,340
Can I skip this one?

2500
02:52:39,540 --> 02:52:43,030
I mean, look, everyone is here.

2501
02:52:43,229 --> 02:52:47,149
Yeah. Wait, why?

2502
02:52:47,350 --> 02:52:48,350
Why King K.

2503
02:52:48,350 --> 02:52:50,030
Rule? Yeah. Why is he on here?

2504
02:52:50,659 --> 02:52:51,819
Please don't do this one.

2505
02:52:52,020 --> 02:52:53,420
This is going to take a million years.

2506
02:52:56,299 --> 02:52:57,219
Maybe we'll come back to it.

2507
02:52:57,420 --> 02:53:00,799
It's a lot.

2508
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,719
Thanksgiving food tier list.

2509
02:53:04,989 --> 02:53:05,950
I can do this one.

2510
02:53:08,819 --> 02:53:09,860
We'll save it. We'll save it.

2511
02:53:10,059 --> 02:53:14,629
I look, I'll go back if people still want me to do it.

2512
02:53:14,829 --> 02:53:16,389
All right, let's go. Easy.

2513
02:53:19,139 --> 02:53:23,979
In fact, this is so easy that this is the only thing that's up here.

2514
02:53:24,180 --> 02:53:25,700
It's on a complete other level.

2515
02:53:26,069 --> 02:53:29,750
Stuffing is on another level than every other food item at Thanksgiving.

2516
02:53:30,260 --> 02:53:32,510
A stamp on it.

2517
02:53:32,709 --> 02:53:34,860
Pumpkin pie. Yuck.

2518
02:53:35,549 --> 02:53:37,350
Apple pie. Yuck.

2519
02:53:37,790 --> 02:53:39,790
Biscuits. Very high.

2520
02:53:41,729 --> 02:53:43,370
Brussels sprouts.

2521
02:53:43,569 --> 02:53:55,409
Squash made no jellied cranberry jellied cranberry.

2522
02:53:55,409 --> 02:53:57,569
They whoever made this list, you know what you're talking about.

2523
02:53:57,770 --> 02:53:59,409
Cranberry sauce. Get out of here.

2524
02:54:02,090 --> 02:54:03,409
Is this a green bean casserole?

2525
02:54:03,409 --> 02:54:04,409
That's also up here.

2526
02:54:05,549 --> 02:54:06,870
One bread that's also up here.

2527
02:54:08,020 --> 02:54:09,700
This is going to be close.

2528
02:54:11,930 --> 02:54:13,610
Corn.

2529
02:54:13,809 --> 02:54:17,829
Hmm. Creamed corn.

2530
02:54:21,149 --> 02:54:23,030
How would dinner dinner rolls?

2531
02:54:23,409 --> 02:54:25,370
No, I want the biscuits and I want the cornbread.

2532
02:54:25,739 --> 02:54:27,930
Gravy. That's OK.

2533
02:54:28,750 --> 02:54:31,190
Ham. No, I don't want ham.

2534
02:54:31,530 --> 02:54:33,250
Mac and cheese. It's up there.

2535
02:54:33,290 --> 02:54:35,290
That's all right. Mashed potatoes.

2536
02:54:35,489 --> 02:54:38,100
You better believe it. Red wine.

2537
02:54:38,299 --> 02:54:42,030
No hard pass. No, no.

2538
02:54:42,540 --> 02:54:44,899
I don't understand this whole pair alcohol with shit.

2539
02:54:44,979 --> 02:54:46,700
No, I want to drink alcohol separately.

2540
02:54:50,719 --> 02:54:51,760
I don't I don't get it.

2541
02:54:53,739 --> 02:54:56,620
I don't want to drink like I would give me like a sprite.

2542
02:54:56,819 --> 02:55:00,739
Well, I'll say I was like a glass of milk over a red wine at dinner.

2543
02:55:01,370 --> 02:55:03,090
I don't like drinking. I love wine.

2544
02:55:03,290 --> 02:55:06,569
Don't get me wrong. Red wine is est here for me and alcohol.

2545
02:55:07,969 --> 02:55:09,930
And I would pair it with this meat.

2546
02:55:09,930 --> 02:55:11,049
What the fuck are you talking about?

2547
02:55:13,409 --> 02:55:14,649
I feel like you're just making that up.

2548
02:55:16,110 --> 02:55:20,879
Do you feel like the people just make that up, that they just go like, oh, oh, oh, yeah.

2549
02:55:21,079 --> 02:55:22,700
And that's that piece of steak.

2550
02:55:22,899 --> 02:55:24,700
Yes. Oh, that that that.

2551
02:55:24,899 --> 02:55:28,780
Wow. I feel like you're just making it up to like seem sophisticated.

2552
02:55:31,079 --> 02:55:31,920
I've done that before.

2553
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:32,399
And it's just like this.

2554
02:55:32,399 --> 02:55:34,840
I just like I just drank wine after eating like a piece of meat.

2555
02:55:38,219 --> 02:55:39,180
And guess what I did?

2556
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:42,000
Guess what I did after I did that?

2557
02:55:44,100 --> 02:55:45,260
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.

2558
02:55:45,260 --> 02:55:46,459
That pairs very well.

2559
02:55:46,459 --> 02:55:48,219
That pair. You know what I want to try?

2560
02:55:48,379 --> 02:55:49,780
I want to try that with the fish.

2561
02:55:49,899 --> 02:55:51,420
I want to try that with the fish.

2562
02:55:51,620 --> 02:55:52,780
It's like, what the fuck are you talking about?

2563
02:55:52,819 --> 02:55:53,659
You're making this up.

2564
02:55:55,579 --> 02:55:58,780
I have done this at least a handful of times before.

2565
02:56:04,399 --> 02:56:10,920
And then you're at dinner and you tell other people and you don't give a shit

2566
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:13,719
about any of this, but you just do because then that person thinks you know what

2567
02:56:13,719 --> 02:56:17,440
you're talking about because you've like had that experience before where it's like,

2568
02:56:17,639 --> 02:56:20,969
oh, you get you're getting the chicken.

2569
02:56:22,110 --> 02:56:22,829
Let me tell you something.

2570
02:56:23,399 --> 02:56:24,879
I'd recommend a Malbec.

2571
02:56:25,079 --> 02:56:26,280
I'd recommend a Malbec.

2572
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:28,799
It's like, oh, wow.

2573
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,889
You you you know why you must die.

2574
02:56:31,889 --> 02:56:33,250
You're much more sophisticated.

2575
02:56:33,290 --> 02:56:34,370
I thought you just ate McDonald's,

2576
02:56:34,569 --> 02:56:38,010
McChickens and ate Capri's drink Capri's son juice boxes.

2577
02:56:38,209 --> 02:56:39,899
No, I do more.

2578
02:56:42,190 --> 02:56:42,989
I just don't get it.

2579
02:56:43,190 --> 02:56:45,270
Maybe call me like uncultured weirdo.

2580
02:56:45,469 --> 02:56:47,389
I I want to drink wine.

2581
02:56:47,829 --> 02:56:50,229
I have a bottle just like drink it.

2582
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:55,020
I don't I don't want like to have you want some wine at dinner.

2583
02:56:55,219 --> 02:56:57,930
Oh, here you go, sir.

2584
02:56:58,819 --> 02:57:00,299
OK, great.

2585
02:57:00,500 --> 02:57:01,459
What am I supposed to do with this?

2586
02:57:03,620 --> 02:57:04,579
What am I supposed to do with that?

2587
02:57:08,610 --> 02:57:09,690
Thanks for the sip of wine.

2588
02:57:09,889 --> 02:57:13,170
That'll be like that'll be like $19, by the way.

2589
02:57:15,739 --> 02:57:18,139
The whole meal was like fucking 20 bucks.

2590
02:57:30,229 --> 02:57:32,350
Oh, yeah, yeah, I could see that.

2591
02:57:32,549 --> 02:57:33,870
I could see that with a casserole.

2592
02:57:40,899 --> 02:57:42,340
Let's backtrack a little bit.

2593
02:57:42,340 --> 02:57:43,420
If you like, like what?

2594
02:57:43,420 --> 02:57:48,860
No, no, I'm not backtracking on this one.

2595
02:57:49,059 --> 02:57:53,569
Roasted vegetables, pretty good scallop potatoes.

2596
02:57:53,569 --> 02:57:54,850
Holy shit. Absolutely.

2597
02:57:55,670 --> 02:57:56,629
Sparkling juice.

2598
02:57:57,840 --> 02:58:01,719
Yep, that I don't have to pretend with that one.

2599
02:58:02,670 --> 02:58:04,950
It's just like it's sparkling like grape juice.

2600
02:58:05,149 --> 02:58:07,309
And I go, oh, my God, this is great.

2601
02:58:07,309 --> 02:58:08,069
I love this.

2602
02:58:09,860 --> 02:58:15,750
I don't have to take the sparkling grape juice and go, oh, oh, yeah.

2603
02:58:15,829 --> 02:58:18,510
Oh, no, just give me the fucking goddamn grape juice.

2604
02:58:18,629 --> 02:58:19,670
I don't you know what I mean?

2605
02:58:23,819 --> 02:58:25,059
Sweet potato casserole.

2606
02:58:25,059 --> 02:58:26,059
It's all right. It's good.

2607
02:58:31,239 --> 02:58:33,559
Fuck you. You put dinner rolls at a hard pass.

2608
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:36,739
Well, because I there's only enough real

2609
02:58:36,940 --> 02:58:41,850
estate on your your plate to have dinner rolls, biscuits.

2610
02:58:41,850 --> 02:58:45,170
They take up a lot of real estate because they're kind of they're a bit like solid

2611
02:58:45,370 --> 02:58:48,930
shape and they have to like you really want like more than one or two.

2612
02:58:49,129 --> 02:58:50,250
But they kind of slide around.

2613
02:58:50,250 --> 02:58:51,209
They take a lot of space.

2614
02:58:53,569 --> 02:58:55,409
I like everything separated, by the way.

2615
02:58:55,610 --> 02:58:58,260
When I go for Thanksgiving dinner and

2616
02:58:58,420 --> 02:59:01,620
if I like somebody made it because I don't fucking do that.

2617
02:59:01,819 --> 02:59:03,340
I fucking don't know how to cook.

2618
02:59:03,540 --> 02:59:06,659
I don't know. I'm not a good like if my mother would make Thanksgiving dinner,

2619
02:59:07,299 --> 02:59:09,079
it's not going to be me.

2620
02:59:10,159 --> 02:59:12,399
I'm going to go separate everything.

2621
02:59:13,030 --> 02:59:14,549
You go up more than once.

2622
02:59:14,750 --> 02:59:16,469
The people you're at the kids table.

2623
02:59:16,670 --> 02:59:20,540
No, I'm not. I'm a grown up.

2624
02:59:20,739 --> 02:59:23,739
So you go get enough.

2625
02:59:23,780 --> 02:59:25,260
I don't like putting everything on top of each other.

2626
02:59:25,260 --> 02:59:27,860
You look at like, oh, I'll go Jerry over there.

2627
02:59:28,059 --> 02:59:30,420
And he's got a plate this high and he's

2628
02:59:30,420 --> 02:59:32,620
putting stuff on top of the biscuits and shit.

2629
02:59:33,219 --> 02:59:36,579
It's like, just come back like you can come back up again.

2630
02:59:37,020 --> 02:59:37,780
You don't have to do that.

2631
02:59:38,860 --> 02:59:41,340
You know, like, you know, like, oh, here's the big turkey.

2632
02:59:41,340 --> 02:59:43,219
Here's like the biscuits. Here's the cranberry sauce.

2633
02:59:43,590 --> 02:59:45,430
Like Uncle Jerry, you don't have to like

2634
02:59:45,809 --> 02:59:47,809
put everything on the plate at the same time.

2635
02:59:48,569 --> 02:59:52,709
I like having turkey sectioned, stuffing sectioned.

2636
02:59:53,149 --> 02:59:54,870
I have everything has to have its own place.

2637
02:59:56,850 --> 02:59:59,370
I don't like when everything's just mixed together and mashed together.

2638
02:59:59,370 --> 03:00:00,569
No, I like it in its own place.

2639
03:00:04,139 --> 03:00:04,899
It gets too messy.

2640
03:00:05,920 --> 03:00:07,520
Things start to blend into each other.

2641
03:00:11,290 --> 03:00:13,569
I would definitely say that

2642
03:00:17,780 --> 03:00:18,700
I'm going to put this at great.

2643
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:26,389
Scalloped potatoes, I'd rather have that that's not accurate.

2644
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:29,629
You put pie in hard pass.

2645
03:00:29,829 --> 03:00:33,250
Banana cream pie is the only pie I like.

2646
03:00:33,450 --> 03:00:36,450
Chocolate cream and banana cream pie are the only two pies that I like to eat.

2647
03:00:37,079 --> 03:00:38,360
I don't like any other pie.

2648
03:00:39,629 --> 03:00:41,950
I'm sorry that everyone doesn't like that.

2649
03:00:45,139 --> 03:00:46,579
Let me put some lip balm on.

2650
03:00:46,780 --> 03:00:48,899
I just realized my eyes have been open for a long time.

2651
03:00:51,389 --> 03:00:52,709
The pie opinion is wrong.

2652
03:00:53,860 --> 03:00:55,739
I just I just don't really like pie.

2653
03:00:57,010 --> 03:00:59,569
I don't like hot pies, like warm pies.

2654
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:01,520
I'm starting to realize this.

2655
03:01:03,139 --> 03:01:09,620
I know the pumpkin pie isn't necessarily warm, but turn on the music.

2656
03:01:09,620 --> 03:01:10,540
What happened? Did we lose it?

2657
03:01:13,930 --> 03:01:17,260
What about the ice cream? No, no.

2658
03:01:17,459 --> 03:01:19,540
Because the ice cream just like melts and turns into liquid.

2659
03:01:19,739 --> 03:01:22,100
And then it's like you it's weird to scoop it up.

2660
03:01:22,299 --> 03:01:24,340
I don't like it.

2661
03:01:24,540 --> 03:01:27,079
Um, what happened to the Deltarune soundtrack?

2662
03:01:35,010 --> 03:01:37,110
OK, here we go.

2663
03:01:44,639 --> 03:01:45,639
Hard pass on ham.

2664
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:47,879
Yeah, to me, Thanksgiving's turkey.

2665
03:01:48,079 --> 03:01:49,879
I don't I'd rather not have ham.

2666
03:01:50,079 --> 03:01:57,930
I'm actually not really a ham guy, if I'm honest to crusty lips.

2667
03:01:57,930 --> 03:02:00,690
I know that's why I have to continuously lubricate them.

2668
03:02:01,010 --> 03:02:02,170
I'm aware.

2669
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:05,260
I think this is good.

2670
03:02:06,209 --> 03:02:07,250
This is good.

2671
03:02:09,610 --> 03:02:10,850
What's up next?

2672
03:02:12,500 --> 03:02:17,340
This one is a create a Christmas movies tier list.

2673
03:02:20,600 --> 03:02:26,129
I'm not even sure I've seen half of these.

2674
03:02:28,610 --> 03:02:30,809
Um, we'll find out.

2675
03:02:33,620 --> 03:02:38,420
I remember this movie because there's a scene in this movie at the end where Bill

2676
03:02:38,620 --> 03:02:45,979
Murray is trying to rile up a crowd and he's like, yeah, let's hear everybody start

2677
03:02:46,020 --> 03:02:47,420
screaming. All right.

2678
03:02:47,620 --> 03:02:49,100
Just just the parents.

2679
03:02:49,299 --> 03:02:51,219
Oh, just the men.

2680
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:53,100
Oh, just the children.

2681
03:02:53,299 --> 03:02:58,299
Oh, and then he goes and you, you that's been talking through the whole movie.

2682
03:02:58,500 --> 03:02:59,420
And I freaked out.

2683
03:02:59,540 --> 03:03:00,819
I thought he was talking to me.

2684
03:03:04,340 --> 03:03:05,540
I thought he was talking to me.

2685
03:03:05,739 --> 03:03:06,659
I was terrified.

2686
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:10,819
I was like, I was talking through the whole movie.

2687
03:03:11,020 --> 03:03:11,940
He knows.

2688
03:03:12,139 --> 03:03:13,340
Skip what? Skip.

2689
03:03:16,340 --> 03:03:17,500
Let me skip.

2690
03:03:17,700 --> 03:03:18,739
It's November.

2691
03:03:25,139 --> 03:03:27,659
All right. Can I just find where my favorite Christmas movie is?

2692
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:28,500
There it is.

2693
03:03:31,860 --> 03:03:35,459
These one and two are up here and this one.

2694
03:03:35,659 --> 03:03:36,180
All right.

2695
03:03:36,379 --> 03:03:37,659
Can I?

2696
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:39,299
This is not going to take me very long.

2697
03:03:45,819 --> 03:03:48,340
Everything else doesn't even I don't even need to put anything else up here.

2698
03:04:00,879 --> 03:04:02,840
Yeah, I'm done.

2699
03:04:03,790 --> 03:04:04,909
Oh, wait, this one. Yeah.

2700
03:04:06,950 --> 03:04:16,159
Uh, where's the where's the claymation, Rudolph?

2701
03:04:19,540 --> 03:04:21,139
Where's the Frosty the Snowman?

2702
03:04:21,139 --> 03:04:22,420
The claymation. Is it on here?

2703
03:04:25,170 --> 03:04:25,809
Oh, there it is.

2704
03:04:31,370 --> 03:04:32,930
This is absolutely legendary.

2705
03:04:33,879 --> 03:04:34,799
What about Die Hard?

2706
03:04:34,799 --> 03:04:36,120
I'm not going to watch Die Hard.

2707
03:04:36,120 --> 03:04:37,280
It's not I'm not going to watch.

2708
03:04:37,479 --> 03:04:38,319
Oh, my God.

2709
03:04:38,319 --> 03:04:39,079
I didn't even see it.

2710
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:42,600
Ernest saves Christmas.

2711
03:04:44,579 --> 03:04:45,020
Mm hmm.

2712
03:04:57,170 --> 03:04:58,850
I've never seen any of the Die Hard movies.

2713
03:04:58,850 --> 03:05:01,379
None of them. Never.

2714
03:05:06,360 --> 03:05:07,120
Never seen Elf.

2715
03:05:22,219 --> 03:05:29,049
I don't know why, but like these are these are all these are all Tim Allen to me.

2716
03:05:31,540 --> 03:05:34,579
I don't know why it's all Tim Allen.

2717
03:05:35,530 --> 03:05:40,840
Every single time that I see like Santa, it's Tim Allen, but it's not.

2718
03:05:40,840 --> 03:05:42,280
But why is it? Why is that happening?

2719
03:05:43,870 --> 03:05:44,909
This is Tim Allen.

2720
03:05:49,190 --> 03:06:03,200
I don't know that jingle all the way is Arnold.

2721
03:06:03,200 --> 03:06:03,559
Yeah.

2722
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,020
And by the way, that's a great one.

2723
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:11,639
But like are these all Tim Allen?

2724
03:06:11,840 --> 03:06:14,149
I feel like there was a point in Tim Allen's

2725
03:06:14,149 --> 03:06:16,670
like career where he just was Santa Claus, but like 10 years straight.

2726
03:06:23,379 --> 03:06:25,540
Put that cookie down now.

2727
03:06:27,899 --> 03:06:28,459
All right.

2728
03:06:28,659 --> 03:06:29,940
The list is over.

2729
03:06:30,139 --> 03:06:32,020
OK, we'll move on.

2730
03:06:32,219 --> 03:06:37,059
This is create a Kevin McLeod royalty free songs tier list.

2731
03:06:40,190 --> 03:06:41,149
We're doing this one.

2732
03:06:46,260 --> 03:06:47,100
All right.

2733
03:06:47,299 --> 03:06:47,860
This one.

2734
03:06:48,059 --> 03:06:49,979
This is called Amazing Plan.

2735
03:06:54,709 --> 03:06:56,709
Like, OK, we're going to get make sure we can all hear it.

2736
03:07:00,159 --> 03:07:01,120
Amazing Plan.

2737
03:07:07,450 --> 03:07:19,639
Yeah. OK.

2738
03:07:19,840 --> 03:07:21,399
I'm going to put this somewhere in B for now.

2739
03:07:25,260 --> 03:07:26,379
All of them are bangers.

2740
03:07:26,459 --> 03:07:28,059
Hold on. We got to make sure we get this right.

2741
03:07:35,729 --> 03:07:36,610
Carefree.

2742
03:07:38,139 --> 03:07:39,700
There's a whole playlist here I can just open.

2743
03:07:44,549 --> 03:07:45,549
We're not on that one yet.

2744
03:07:45,549 --> 03:07:47,069
We're not on Sneaky Snitch yet.

2745
03:07:53,780 --> 03:07:59,139
We're looking for Carefree, Carefree.

2746
03:08:00,930 --> 03:08:03,010
I've used Sneaky Snitch like five times.

2747
03:08:03,129 --> 03:08:07,420
So look at how many songs there are.

2748
03:08:11,899 --> 03:08:13,180
All right. Let's see where this one goes.

2749
03:08:17,329 --> 03:08:18,569
Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's high.

2750
03:08:19,520 --> 03:08:21,079
That's incredibly high.

2751
03:08:31,500 --> 03:08:33,340
I've sung over this one before.

2752
03:08:36,979 --> 03:08:38,620
OK, good. What about Cypher?

2753
03:08:44,629 --> 03:08:46,309
It's a 10 hour version.

2754
03:08:49,250 --> 03:08:51,649
OK, I would put this one at S,

2755
03:08:51,649 --> 03:08:55,729
but unfortunately, it's been in like 40 percent of every mobile game I've ever

2756
03:08:55,930 --> 03:08:58,129
played, so it's got to come down a little bit.

2757
03:09:09,959 --> 03:09:13,219
I think it's, yeah, right here.

2758
03:09:21,280 --> 03:09:22,879
It's, it's so good, though.

2759
03:09:23,079 --> 03:09:24,079
It's so good.

2760
03:09:25,540 --> 03:09:26,500
All right.

2761
03:09:26,700 --> 03:09:29,059
A Darkest Child.

2762
03:09:34,299 --> 03:09:40,299
OK, this one's a scary one.

2763
03:09:45,739 --> 03:09:46,500
I like it.

2764
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:07,549
I'm going to keep it in A.

2765
03:10:07,750 --> 03:10:09,190
Fluffing a Duck.

2766
03:10:10,139 --> 03:10:12,540
Where's the one that I've heard a million times?

2767
03:10:12,739 --> 03:10:16,680
It's going in S. What's it called?

2768
03:10:17,680 --> 03:10:20,000
Yeah, this I've heard this so many times.

2769
03:10:24,090 --> 03:10:25,690
That's up at S.

2770
03:10:28,049 --> 03:10:30,450
God, so many of these just are used

2771
03:10:30,649 --> 03:10:37,049
for when like the vlogger is like moving from like one room to the other.

2772
03:10:37,250 --> 03:10:38,930
Or from, OK, we're going to go do this.

2773
03:10:39,129 --> 03:10:42,809
And there's like a small montage or it's just in the background.

2774
03:10:43,010 --> 03:10:46,370
This is in the background permanently on so many channels.

2775
03:10:47,579 --> 03:10:51,979
I've heard this song so many fucking times.

2776
03:10:56,829 --> 03:10:58,989
I've used this song so many times.

2777
03:11:01,219 --> 03:11:03,180
Yeah. OK, what about Hitman?

2778
03:11:03,620 --> 03:11:04,739
Let's see, how about this one?

2779
03:11:18,620 --> 03:11:19,379
Hmm.

2780
03:11:23,860 --> 03:11:28,750
Eh, it's all right.

2781
03:11:32,010 --> 03:11:32,850
It's OK.

2782
03:11:35,719 --> 03:11:36,920
Yeah, it's all right.

2783
03:11:37,870 --> 03:11:43,139
I guess it could be used for some kind of action sequence, right?

2784
03:11:44,280 --> 03:11:55,299
This one's called a jaunty gumption.

2785
03:11:56,659 --> 03:11:59,260
This is glue man's fucking original entrance music.

2786
03:12:10,700 --> 03:12:11,700
Yep, there's the

2787
03:12:16,010 --> 03:12:16,809
penis music.

2788
03:12:17,010 --> 03:12:18,010
Kind of.

2789
03:12:22,670 --> 03:12:24,350
That's probably the best one so far.

2790
03:12:24,549 --> 03:12:26,270
All right. Local forecast.

2791
03:12:26,469 --> 03:12:40,229
How about that one?

2792
03:12:42,340 --> 03:12:44,260
Oh, this is in so many things, too.

2793
03:12:44,459 --> 03:12:48,139
This is in so many games and like ads.

2794
03:12:48,340 --> 03:12:55,110
Oh, I just like keep seeing it.

2795
03:12:55,309 --> 03:12:56,469
No, I can't put it in S.

2796
03:12:56,670 --> 03:13:00,549
I've heard it in too many things that traumatized me.

2797
03:13:07,329 --> 03:13:08,729
I'll put it in A.

2798
03:13:10,899 --> 03:13:12,620
OK, this one's called Look Busy.

2799
03:13:31,870 --> 03:13:48,549
This is a classic, but I don't know if it should be up all the way at S.

2800
03:13:48,750 --> 03:13:49,909
It's good. It's good.

2801
03:13:49,909 --> 03:13:52,309
But I put it above this, I think.

2802
03:13:53,069 --> 03:13:59,600
Yeah. OK, Meatball Parade.

2803
03:14:05,420 --> 03:14:06,940
I feel like I know this one.

2804
03:14:07,139 --> 03:14:09,420
Oh, yeah, this is S.

2805
03:14:13,889 --> 03:14:15,090
Without a doubt.

2806
03:14:20,010 --> 03:14:22,129
This is the cartoon music I played when I

2807
03:14:22,329 --> 03:14:24,729
streamed Overwatch back in like 2016.

2808
03:14:32,979 --> 03:14:37,500
Yep. OK, that's brap music.

2809
03:14:38,770 --> 03:14:40,010
I don't even know what that means.

2810
03:14:40,450 --> 03:14:41,969
All right. Marigo.

2811
03:14:47,909 --> 03:14:54,479
Marigo.

2812
03:15:11,879 --> 03:15:13,600
No, I hate this one. I hate this one.

2813
03:15:15,379 --> 03:15:18,579
It's not because the music's bad because I've just seen it and heard it so many

2814
03:15:18,620 --> 03:15:20,299
times and play it. Just I don't like it.

2815
03:15:22,469 --> 03:15:25,229
Monkeys spinning monkeys.

2816
03:15:25,430 --> 03:15:35,270
Oh, God.

2817
03:15:40,840 --> 03:15:53,290
I can recite this one by heart, so it has to be up here.

2818
03:16:03,520 --> 03:16:06,360
All right. Pixel Peeker Polka.

2819
03:16:26,190 --> 03:16:30,930
It's good, but it can't beat the classics for me.

2820
03:16:41,989 --> 03:16:43,110
Yeah. OK. Yep.

2821
03:16:43,309 --> 03:16:44,469
I think it belongs there.

2822
03:16:44,670 --> 03:16:45,790
This run amok.

2823
03:16:45,989 --> 03:16:49,829
I feel like this is the ultimate YouTuber one, right?

2824
03:16:53,819 --> 03:16:56,780
This I think this is the ultimate YouTuber song, isn't it?

2825
03:17:04,450 --> 03:17:11,729
I know. Oh, no, no, this is it.

2826
03:17:11,930 --> 03:17:14,170
This is the way this is Glooman.

2827
03:17:14,370 --> 03:17:15,729
This is Glooman.

2828
03:17:17,129 --> 03:17:19,049
Wait, no, this is this is the OK.

2829
03:17:19,250 --> 03:17:20,809
This is Glooman 2.

2830
03:17:25,979 --> 03:17:29,340
Yeah, this is Glooman second entrance music.

2831
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:32,639
I actually like this one better.

2832
03:17:36,729 --> 03:17:44,959
And then down down.

2833
03:17:48,159 --> 03:17:50,440
Then it did.

2834
03:17:51,389 --> 03:17:52,590
I don't like that part.

2835
03:17:54,440 --> 03:17:55,399
That's the only part I don't like.

2836
03:17:56,819 --> 03:17:58,700
All right. Scheming weasel.

2837
03:18:08,809 --> 03:18:10,889
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2838
03:18:23,489 --> 03:18:24,809
Does this take over fluffing a duck?

2839
03:18:24,809 --> 03:18:27,250
I think this is I think this is like a better version of fluffing a duck.

2840
03:18:28,969 --> 03:18:30,329
I think we have to change that.

2841
03:18:39,280 --> 03:18:42,579
Yep. OK. Sneaky Adventure.

2842
03:18:57,620 --> 03:19:09,459
This is in the archaeology stream, right?

2843
03:19:09,659 --> 03:19:15,100
Was it this incredible space program?

2844
03:19:19,059 --> 03:19:20,819
Dude, look at this bucket thing. Ready?

2845
03:19:21,200 --> 03:19:21,840
Look at this.

2846
03:19:23,430 --> 03:19:25,270
You see the bottom of this cup.

2847
03:19:26,670 --> 03:19:32,100
It's like starting to get like so wet down here that it's like losing its.

2848
03:19:35,219 --> 03:19:37,139
It's kind of like it's going to come out.

2849
03:19:37,709 --> 03:19:39,510
The bottom is going to fall out of this thing.

2850
03:19:43,979 --> 03:19:44,860
Yeah, look at this.

2851
03:19:49,659 --> 03:19:51,020
It should not be doing this.

2852
03:19:54,659 --> 03:19:59,180
Drink it faster. I'm slowing down as it's all right.

2853
03:19:59,379 --> 03:19:59,899
All right.

2854
03:20:00,100 --> 03:20:07,479
We already know what the sneaky snitch sounds like, but let's just put it up there.

2855
03:20:07,680 --> 03:20:10,280
It's not going to it's going to be lower than I think a lot of you guys think.

2856
03:20:20,700 --> 03:20:22,299
I don't like it.

2857
03:20:22,940 --> 03:20:27,299
I use this song in Otto's dog farts messing up my game.

2858
03:20:27,500 --> 03:20:28,739
And I hate it ever since.

2859
03:20:33,459 --> 03:20:34,899
What a bad video.

2860
03:20:37,459 --> 03:20:40,139
Jesus Christ.

2861
03:20:40,340 --> 03:20:49,809
OK, like I thought to record, put music on that, render it, upload it and publish it.

2862
03:20:50,440 --> 03:20:51,799
I don't know why.

2863
03:20:53,579 --> 03:20:56,579
Why would that you know what it was?

2864
03:20:57,020 --> 03:21:00,379
That was oh, my God, it's been like three days without a video.

2865
03:21:00,379 --> 03:21:01,819
I don't have anything ready.

2866
03:21:02,520 --> 03:21:03,879
I need to do something.

2867
03:21:05,020 --> 03:21:06,139
Sometimes that would happen.

2868
03:21:07,540 --> 03:21:10,899
Yeah, that that's the YouTuber panic mode where it's been four days.

2869
03:21:13,069 --> 03:21:16,639
I have to upload something that really

2870
03:21:16,760 --> 03:21:20,049
only happened like maybe 10 times total.

2871
03:21:23,299 --> 03:21:30,469
And then after like after like 2013, 2014, I did not really give a shit about that

2872
03:21:30,670 --> 03:21:33,819
anymore. And it was smite gameplay.

2873
03:21:34,020 --> 03:21:34,899
Yeah. Watch that.

2874
03:21:35,100 --> 03:21:40,489
Watch it. Delete it on stream.

2875
03:21:40,690 --> 03:21:54,370
I don't want to watch this video.

2876
03:22:00,250 --> 03:22:03,360
It's two minutes.

2877
03:22:05,010 --> 03:22:07,610
I'm only going to stomach this video for like 30 seconds, I think.

2878
03:22:10,799 --> 03:22:13,120
If you want to eat healthy and feel your best.

2879
03:22:13,319 --> 03:22:15,040
That's not my video.

2880
03:22:23,290 --> 03:22:37,500
All right. I'm willing to give this 30 seconds because the music

2881
03:22:41,100 --> 03:22:42,579
and ally has been.

2882
03:22:42,780 --> 03:22:44,139
Oh, my God.

2883
03:22:44,340 --> 03:22:46,180
Oh, my dog just farted.

2884
03:22:46,379 --> 03:22:47,979
I thought all this sucks.

2885
03:22:48,180 --> 03:22:48,979
It's horrible, dude.

2886
03:22:49,180 --> 03:22:50,379
I can't

2887
03:22:51,059 --> 03:22:53,180
shit me right now.

2888
03:22:53,379 --> 03:22:55,420
I can't like play the game.

2889
03:22:55,620 --> 03:22:56,819
Be careful. They're right here.

2890
03:22:57,020 --> 03:22:58,540
I can't I can't get smites.

2891
03:22:58,540 --> 03:22:59,739
One of those games where you can't leave.

2892
03:22:59,739 --> 03:23:00,540
I can't leave right now.

2893
03:23:00,739 --> 03:23:04,430
I have to like accept this for what happened.

2894
03:23:04,629 --> 03:23:07,870
It's not like I can just get up and like walk away right now.

2895
03:23:08,750 --> 03:23:12,510
Seriously, man, this is horrendous.

2896
03:23:13,270 --> 03:23:14,350
It's the whole video.

2897
03:23:14,549 --> 03:23:16,350
God, hold on.

2898
03:23:16,549 --> 03:23:17,309
I'm serious.

2899
03:23:17,510 --> 03:23:18,469
I hold on a second.

2900
03:23:18,670 --> 03:23:20,469
I'm fucking sorry.

2901
03:23:21,299 --> 03:23:22,739
Oh, my God.

2902
03:23:22,940 --> 03:23:23,860
What happened to your voice?

2903
03:23:24,059 --> 03:23:25,299
I aged 10 years.

2904
03:23:25,500 --> 03:23:26,219
Here I come.

2905
03:23:26,909 --> 03:23:28,190
Oh, you don't even need my help.

2906
03:23:28,389 --> 03:23:35,549
What do you? I got him.

2907
03:23:35,750 --> 03:23:37,549
Seriously. All right.

2908
03:23:37,750 --> 03:23:38,989
Right, go on.

2909
03:23:39,190 --> 03:23:41,350
Yes, shoo.

2910
03:23:41,549 --> 03:23:43,950
Dude, can you can you imagine if I just like

2911
03:23:44,069 --> 03:23:46,149
if you guys both died right there?

2912
03:23:46,530 --> 03:23:47,649
I'll try.

2913
03:23:47,850 --> 03:23:50,340
What?

2914
03:23:50,860 --> 03:23:52,299
No, that was miles away.

2915
03:23:52,500 --> 03:23:53,899
Boston wore off with age.

2916
03:23:54,100 --> 03:23:56,659
Yeah, it did. What?

2917
03:23:56,860 --> 03:24:01,139
Especially since moving to like three years ago, I was losing it a little bit,

2918
03:24:01,340 --> 03:24:05,059
but then it was it's almost still pops up now and then.

2919
03:24:07,350 --> 03:24:09,629
No, no, I just saw her.

2920
03:24:09,829 --> 03:24:11,309
You're dead. You are dead.

2921
03:24:11,510 --> 03:24:12,989
Yeah.

2922
03:24:13,190 --> 03:24:14,670
Fucking dog.

2923
03:24:17,350 --> 03:24:20,510
Oh, blame the dog for your bad.

2924
03:24:21,190 --> 03:24:23,229
Your dog didn't like fart in my face.

2925
03:24:23,430 --> 03:24:25,110
Like that would not have happened.

2926
03:24:25,309 --> 03:24:26,670
I didn't like poop.

2927
03:24:26,870 --> 03:24:29,110
No, he didn't. He's right here.

2928
03:24:29,620 --> 03:24:31,299
Have you like checked the floor?

2929
03:24:31,500 --> 03:24:36,329
No, there's no like, oh,

2930
03:24:36,530 --> 03:24:38,250
that like completely threw my game off.

2931
03:24:38,250 --> 03:24:40,489
We were doing like, oh, actually, we killed him.

2932
03:24:40,690 --> 03:24:42,450
But I was doing like well.

2933
03:24:42,450 --> 03:24:45,690
And then the dog farted in my face and it was just over.

2934
03:24:47,090 --> 03:24:48,370
That's the entire video.

2935
03:24:49,899 --> 03:24:51,500
Is it say, did you like that video?

2936
03:24:51,500 --> 03:24:53,579
Make sure you like like the video if you did.

2937
03:24:56,540 --> 03:24:58,500
Oh, I lost. Oh, what the fuck, dog?

2938
03:24:58,500 --> 03:24:59,819
Well, I can't believe you did that.

2939
03:25:00,020 --> 03:25:01,219
Please, God, upload a video.

2940
03:25:01,979 --> 03:25:03,620
It's funny. It's it's funny enough.

2941
03:25:03,819 --> 03:25:14,680
It could go up. Terrible video.

2942
03:25:14,879 --> 03:25:23,059
Apologize to Otto.

2943
03:25:26,670 --> 03:25:27,950
Did he actually fart?

2944
03:25:28,149 --> 03:25:29,510
You think I made it up?

2945
03:25:29,950 --> 03:25:33,190
I made that whole thing up for like the video?

2946
03:25:33,389 --> 03:25:36,049
No,

2947
03:25:36,250 --> 03:25:37,969
it would have been so stupid.

2948
03:25:40,139 --> 03:25:46,440
That was, yeah, it's called uncensored.

2949
03:25:49,219 --> 03:25:57,420
Back when swearing, I was concerned about Jesus Christ.

2950
03:25:58,629 --> 03:26:00,190
I didn't pretend it really happened.

2951
03:26:00,190 --> 03:26:03,860
It did. And what happened to your voice?

2952
03:26:04,059 --> 03:26:12,719
Well, I have a new old mic from like almost 10 years ago and I've aged 10 years.

2953
03:26:18,469 --> 03:26:20,590
Well, that that guy is so funny.

2954
03:26:20,790 --> 03:26:25,510
Where did you find this guy?

2955
03:26:25,709 --> 03:26:27,510
Not even watching VODs from last year.

2956
03:26:27,510 --> 03:26:28,549
You sound different.

2957
03:26:30,139 --> 03:26:32,899
I also got like an Excel, a GoXLR, too.

2958
03:26:32,899 --> 03:26:34,420
I remember when I changed over to the GoXLR,

2959
03:26:34,420 --> 03:26:36,620
everyone was like, what the fuck happened to your voice?

2960
03:26:36,780 --> 03:26:38,700
That was like a year and a half ago, two years ago.

2961
03:26:39,079 --> 03:26:43,500
Yeah, I changed like my setup.

2962
03:26:43,940 --> 03:26:48,280
I had a different mic and everything, so I missed the old German's voice.

2963
03:26:48,280 --> 03:26:50,879
Well, it's never coming back because apparently I've got like all kinds of

2964
03:26:51,079 --> 03:26:54,879
sinus and throat weird issues on top of my other medical problems.

2965
03:26:54,879 --> 03:26:55,920
I'm just I'm getting old.

2966
03:26:55,920 --> 03:26:57,680
I'm so I'm going to start talking like this.

2967
03:26:57,879 --> 03:27:00,239
Once I start talking like this, that's how you know that things are.

2968
03:27:00,440 --> 03:27:02,120
I'm getting a little older.

2969
03:27:02,319 --> 03:27:06,360
This is exactly how I'm going to sound by the time I'm like 55, I think.

2970
03:27:06,559 --> 03:27:08,319
So I'm just it's just going there.

2971
03:27:10,739 --> 03:27:12,020
All right, we'll get a wallpaper.

2972
03:27:12,219 --> 03:27:22,719
Let's watch that one wallpaper.

2973
03:27:22,920 --> 03:27:23,920
OK, let's do it.

2974
03:27:24,120 --> 03:27:25,200
I don't remember this one.

2975
03:27:25,399 --> 03:27:26,680
What is this one?

2976
03:27:28,889 --> 03:27:31,969
Yeah, this one's in every mobile game as well.

2977
03:27:42,579 --> 03:27:44,260
F, I don't think it's F.

2978
03:27:46,500 --> 03:27:47,739
It's just not that high.

2979
03:27:53,549 --> 03:27:54,989
OK, how about there it is?

2980
03:27:59,850 --> 03:28:03,530
What keeps happening to the Deltarune soundtrack?

2981
03:28:03,729 --> 03:28:04,770
I just keep deleting it.

2982
03:28:06,360 --> 03:28:07,479
I was wondering, I was like, where is it?

2983
03:28:31,280 --> 03:28:34,020
Yeah, that's not porn music.

2984
03:28:36,450 --> 03:28:38,290
Who likes to party to wrap it up?

2985
03:28:38,329 --> 03:28:41,659
Let's see.

2986
03:28:41,860 --> 03:28:49,940
This is climbing,

2987
03:28:56,909 --> 03:29:00,069
falling back, it's losing traction.

2988
03:29:01,090 --> 03:29:03,489
Wait, I like that little organ.

2989
03:29:05,590 --> 03:29:09,530
I be there you are.

2990
03:29:09,729 --> 03:29:13,010
There's your Kevin, your Kevin McCloud

2991
03:29:13,579 --> 03:29:19,159
McLeod tier list for royalty free songs.

2992
03:29:21,969 --> 03:29:22,450
There it is.

2993
03:29:28,260 --> 03:29:29,739
Claps very lots of claps.

2994
03:29:29,940 --> 03:29:40,690
Yeah. OK, now difficult games tier list either.

2995
03:29:40,889 --> 03:29:44,049
I have to rate these by impossible to like angry to.

2996
03:29:44,049 --> 03:29:45,010
This is going to be hard.

2997
03:29:46,979 --> 03:29:48,059
Some of these I haven't played.

2998
03:29:51,450 --> 03:29:52,489
All right. Lord of the Rings.

2999
03:29:52,690 --> 03:29:54,250
Fuck this game.

3000
03:29:54,450 --> 03:29:59,120
I would say not that I can't beat it, but it was just stupid.

3001
03:29:59,200 --> 03:30:00,600
OK, that's going all the way up here.

3002
03:30:01,420 --> 03:30:04,579
Cuphead was I got angry, but I was able to do it.

3003
03:30:04,780 --> 03:30:07,579
Jump King was unbearable as well.

3004
03:30:09,620 --> 03:30:10,899
And everyone wanted me to do the DLC.

3005
03:30:10,899 --> 03:30:11,899
I was like, I refuse.

3006
03:30:12,600 --> 03:30:14,200
I absolutely refuse to do the DLC.

3007
03:30:14,200 --> 03:30:16,420
I won't be able to get through it.

3008
03:30:16,620 --> 03:30:17,700
Ikaruga.

3009
03:30:18,520 --> 03:30:22,219
I I don't remember.

3010
03:30:22,420 --> 03:30:26,090
I think I played this for like an hour.

3011
03:30:29,430 --> 03:30:30,309
I don't remember.

3012
03:30:32,799 --> 03:30:37,180
I cheated. Yeah.

3013
03:30:37,379 --> 03:30:41,750
Well, OK, can't beat it to me is like I beat all these games.

3014
03:30:42,579 --> 03:30:45,540
But should this be OK?

3015
03:30:45,540 --> 03:30:49,139
So this should be on the list of like things I actually just did not play.

3016
03:30:49,340 --> 03:30:50,780
You played Ikaruga as a joke.

3017
03:30:50,780 --> 03:30:52,180
Yeah. All right. So let's put it down here.

3018
03:30:53,700 --> 03:30:57,489
What is this? What game is that?

3019
03:30:57,489 --> 03:30:58,969
I can't I can't tell. What is that?

3020
03:31:01,899 --> 03:31:07,319
What is it? Is it Monster Hunter?

3021
03:31:10,319 --> 03:31:14,979
I don't think Monster Hunter is kind of hard, but it's I thought it was fine.

3022
03:31:15,180 --> 03:31:16,299
This was some annoyance.

3023
03:31:20,190 --> 03:31:24,030
Is this I can't tell what that is.

3024
03:31:27,030 --> 03:31:28,309
Oh, it's a different Monster Hunter.

3025
03:31:28,309 --> 03:31:29,309
OK, well, I haven't played it.

3026
03:31:29,309 --> 03:31:30,190
What's this one?

3027
03:31:35,690 --> 03:31:37,170
I don't think I've ever played this one either.

3028
03:31:39,020 --> 03:31:41,190
That's what is it?

3029
03:31:41,389 --> 03:31:42,709
Mushi.

3030
03:31:43,540 --> 03:31:44,620
Oh, I haven't played it.

3031
03:31:45,120 --> 03:31:49,159
Salt and Sanctuary was was hard, but that wasn't that bad.

3032
03:31:49,159 --> 03:31:50,280
It was some annoyance there.

3033
03:31:53,020 --> 03:31:54,739
I don't I don't think I played this either.

3034
03:31:58,129 --> 03:31:59,129
I don't know what that is.

3035
03:32:01,170 --> 03:32:02,010
What is this one?

3036
03:32:02,450 --> 03:32:04,649
Oh, there's all these Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter 2.

3037
03:32:04,850 --> 03:32:07,659
No War Fortress never played it.

3038
03:32:09,260 --> 03:32:10,420
Spelunky.

3039
03:32:10,620 --> 03:32:12,579
I just like I didn't really like it.

3040
03:32:13,079 --> 03:32:13,959
I wasn't into it.

3041
03:32:15,829 --> 03:32:16,870
I'm going to should I put it?

3042
03:32:16,870 --> 03:32:17,469
It can't beat it.

3043
03:32:17,469 --> 03:32:18,989
But I played it, but I just didn't like it.

3044
03:32:19,190 --> 03:32:20,670
So I'm going to put that down here.

3045
03:32:22,260 --> 03:32:23,180
Battle.

3046
03:32:24,709 --> 03:32:25,709
Yeah, Riga.

3047
03:32:26,219 --> 03:32:27,340
I don't know what that is.

3048
03:32:27,540 --> 03:32:28,340
Overwhelm.

3049
03:32:28,540 --> 03:32:29,940
I don't know what that is.

3050
03:32:30,139 --> 03:32:33,920
Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden Black.

3051
03:32:33,920 --> 03:32:34,840
I don't think I've ever played this.

3052
03:32:37,780 --> 03:32:38,659
I never played this one.

3053
03:32:39,350 --> 03:32:43,500
Finding of Isaac is it depends on your run, I think.

3054
03:32:44,840 --> 03:32:46,639
Oh, everyone's OK.

3055
03:32:46,840 --> 03:32:48,920
I was completely ignoring everybody saying

3056
03:32:49,120 --> 03:32:53,040
Deltarune because I was I thought you said it was you were saying it was on this list.

3057
03:32:53,569 --> 03:32:55,209
I was like, they just say it's not on this list.

3058
03:32:55,209 --> 03:32:56,450
Why are they saying it's a hard game?

3059
03:32:58,360 --> 03:33:00,360
It's like people like Deltarune, Deltarune, Deltarune.

3060
03:33:00,360 --> 03:33:01,280
It's like it's not even on here.

3061
03:33:01,280 --> 03:33:02,319
Why are people saying that?

3062
03:33:02,520 --> 03:33:04,680
And then I realized what was going on.

3063
03:33:23,100 --> 03:33:24,780
I have not played FTL.

3064
03:33:25,739 --> 03:33:27,340
I've not played Into the Breach.

3065
03:33:27,540 --> 03:33:28,819
I've not played Battletech.

3066
03:33:29,020 --> 03:33:29,780
I have not.

3067
03:33:29,979 --> 03:33:33,219
I played Enter the Gungeon for a little bit, but I didn't really play it.

3068
03:33:33,219 --> 03:33:35,020
I didn't really really care too much.

3069
03:33:35,020 --> 03:33:35,819
Hotline Miami.

3070
03:33:35,819 --> 03:33:38,059
This game is fucking unbelievably unbearable,

3071
03:33:38,260 --> 03:33:39,819
although the second one is way worse.

3072
03:33:40,020 --> 03:33:41,379
This one is still up here.

3073
03:33:42,260 --> 03:33:47,600
The Witness is that I didn't play.

3074
03:33:47,680 --> 03:33:49,719
That's just like the line puzzle game, right?

3075
03:33:52,020 --> 03:33:54,600
I didn't play it.

3076
03:33:54,799 --> 03:33:59,040
Mario the Lost Levels are they're pretty bad, but not really.

3077
03:33:59,239 --> 03:34:04,639
Hades was challenging, but it was still like doable.

3078
03:34:04,840 --> 03:34:08,930
Hades is probably now Cuphead's probably more annoying.

3079
03:34:10,459 --> 03:34:13,100
Bloodborne is up here too, but I don't think it was.

3080
03:34:13,299 --> 03:34:19,180
I wouldn't say Bloodborne is it's up there pretty high.

3081
03:34:19,379 --> 03:34:20,979
Some of those bosses were horrible.

3082
03:34:21,180 --> 03:34:23,379
This is literally an uncompletable video game.

3083
03:34:23,579 --> 03:34:26,899
You cannot beat this without cheats.

3084
03:34:27,139 --> 03:34:32,379
It's it's not possible to beat this without like a game genie.

3085
03:34:33,219 --> 03:34:34,139
Louder.

3086
03:34:34,649 --> 03:34:37,040
I'll give you 10 percent louder.

3087
03:34:37,239 --> 03:34:39,219
What else we got?

3088
03:34:39,420 --> 03:34:41,020
Stuntman. Why is this on here?

3089
03:34:41,219 --> 03:34:43,219
Did you make this list specifically for me?

3090
03:34:46,600 --> 03:34:49,920
If this wait, why Stuntman Ignition on here?

3091
03:34:54,649 --> 03:34:58,690
I was like pissed at this game, but this is not considered a hard game.

3092
03:34:58,889 --> 03:35:04,290
Is it? Is it?

3093
03:35:04,489 --> 03:35:08,579
I don't know. What an egomaniac.

3094
03:35:08,780 --> 03:35:09,819
All right.

3095
03:35:10,020 --> 03:35:10,979
What is this?

3096
03:35:11,139 --> 03:35:13,020
Drifter or played it.

3097
03:35:13,389 --> 03:35:14,989
I think Celeste was balanced.

3098
03:35:18,629 --> 03:35:20,750
I don't think I got too annoyed with Celeste.

3099
03:35:20,950 --> 03:35:24,069
Noida, on the other hand, I could I just can't fucking do it.

3100
03:35:24,270 --> 03:35:25,829
I cannot fucking do it.

3101
03:35:26,659 --> 03:35:29,540
Super Meat Boy was bad, but it was possible.

3102
03:35:29,739 --> 03:35:31,620
I don't think it was that high up, though.

3103
03:35:33,079 --> 03:35:36,200
Original Castlevania was annoying.

3104
03:35:36,399 --> 03:35:39,360
But like, I'm not going to who's going to play that right now?

3105
03:35:41,459 --> 03:35:44,340
Like, it's like, oh, OK, like Castlevania, the original one.

3106
03:35:44,540 --> 03:35:47,290
Like, yeah, it's I was hard back then.

3107
03:35:47,290 --> 03:35:50,729
But I can compare to like Jump King.

3108
03:35:50,930 --> 03:35:52,649
It's like kind of two different.

3109
03:35:54,500 --> 03:35:56,219
I don't know what this is. I didn't play it.

3110
03:35:57,040 --> 03:35:58,719
The original Dark Souls.

3111
03:36:02,940 --> 03:36:04,940
What's harder, Bloodborne or Dark Souls?

3112
03:36:05,139 --> 03:36:06,819
I feel like they're hard for different reasons.

3113
03:36:10,579 --> 03:36:12,620
The original Dark Souls is probably more annoying.

3114
03:36:13,959 --> 03:36:20,389
Yeah, Super Meat Boy is not really hard.

3115
03:36:20,389 --> 03:36:21,709
It just takes memorization.

3116
03:36:21,909 --> 03:36:24,649
You just have to memorize levels,

3117
03:36:24,850 --> 03:36:27,969
which you could say the same thing about Dark Souls bosses, but not really.

3118
03:36:28,170 --> 03:36:31,610
Because Dark Souls bosses, unlike Super Meat Boy,

3119
03:36:32,010 --> 03:36:34,569
they have a range of attacks that they will do,

3120
03:36:34,770 --> 03:36:37,809
but you don't know which attack they're going to do.

3121
03:36:38,010 --> 03:36:41,889
In Super Meat Boy, you know the levels are just the same.

3122
03:36:41,889 --> 03:36:43,610
You just have to memorize the level.

3123
03:36:45,010 --> 03:36:52,579
So these are probably that's probably a good spot.

3124
03:36:52,780 --> 03:36:54,299
Isaac,

3125
03:36:55,250 --> 03:37:00,809
Isaac can be really annoying sometimes, but Demon's Souls was probably harder

3126
03:37:01,010 --> 03:37:11,139
than just like the world tendency shit made this game so fucking hard sometimes.

3127
03:37:11,340 --> 03:37:12,540
Hard or frustrating?

3128
03:37:20,229 --> 03:37:21,549
I feel like the first few worlds,

3129
03:37:21,549 --> 03:37:24,309
like the first two or three worlds in Demon's Souls were not that hard.

3130
03:37:29,739 --> 03:37:30,659
That's still annoying.

3131
03:37:33,020 --> 03:37:37,459
Desert bus doesn't I mean, why even there's no reason to do that.

3132
03:37:37,659 --> 03:37:39,620
I have not played any of the Devil May Cry games.

3133
03:37:39,819 --> 03:37:43,479
I I got through some of Hollow Knight on stream,

3134
03:37:43,920 --> 03:37:45,879
but people are mad that I never went back to it.

3135
03:37:46,079 --> 03:37:47,280
But just that's the way it is.

3136
03:37:47,479 --> 03:37:49,040
Surge.

3137
03:37:55,370 --> 03:37:58,819
We have a lot of new viewers.

3138
03:38:00,659 --> 03:38:03,379
I was I said a lot of mean things about the surge.

3139
03:38:05,190 --> 03:38:06,030
Do you know those?

3140
03:38:06,229 --> 03:38:10,110
I was streaming the surge to like 600 viewers or something like it was.

3141
03:38:10,110 --> 03:38:12,709
I had like 500 viewers at the time, but like less than a thousand at the time.

3142
03:38:12,909 --> 03:38:13,309
Right.

3143
03:38:13,879 --> 03:38:17,239
That was very beginning of my like Twitch life.

3144
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:19,040
Holy fuck.

3145
03:38:19,239 --> 03:38:20,520
I hated that whole thing.

3146
03:38:21,090 --> 03:38:24,010
I was infuriated by that whole experience.

3147
03:38:25,979 --> 03:38:29,420
You said it was literally the worst video game ever made.

3148
03:38:34,790 --> 03:38:35,389
It's a good game.

3149
03:38:35,590 --> 03:38:37,629
You're just a literal baby.

3150
03:38:44,729 --> 03:38:47,510
Does anybody have like a clip from that stream?

3151
03:38:48,530 --> 03:38:50,690
Any of you guys, some of you like lore masters

3152
03:38:50,690 --> 03:38:58,819
that have like a like a saved clip of me being like a psycho on that stream?

3153
03:38:59,020 --> 03:38:59,860
Somebody does.

3154
03:39:04,399 --> 03:39:08,969
OK, well, I'm just going to I'm going to put it down here because I played it

3155
03:39:09,170 --> 03:39:10,649
for like maybe an hour and a half.

3156
03:39:14,420 --> 03:39:16,340
Just watch the VOD.

3157
03:39:16,540 --> 03:39:17,459
OK, hold on.

3158
03:39:22,250 --> 03:39:23,409
I'm going to let's see.

3159
03:39:26,979 --> 03:39:27,780
Let's get it.

3160
03:39:29,440 --> 03:39:30,959
It's definitely on the archive.

3161
03:39:32,680 --> 03:39:33,840
The surge.

3162
03:39:37,610 --> 03:39:40,010
Yeah. OK, this is from like five years ago.

3163
03:39:40,450 --> 03:39:41,610
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

3164
03:39:41,809 --> 03:39:46,020
OK, you guys ready to see what my thought?

3165
03:39:46,100 --> 03:39:47,899
Where should I put the surge on this tier list?

3166
03:39:53,360 --> 03:39:54,840
We're going to skip through when I'm going to watch the whole thing.

3167
03:40:01,680 --> 03:40:06,340
Hey, how long did I scream this for?

3168
03:40:09,149 --> 03:40:17,610
I wonder. We'll find out.

3169
03:40:19,389 --> 03:40:20,750
So this is the surge.

3170
03:40:23,299 --> 03:40:25,219
An hour and 55 minutes.

3171
03:40:25,420 --> 03:40:26,219
Holy shit.

3172
03:40:27,500 --> 03:40:31,020
And the first 10 to 20 minutes is absolutely me like introduction.

3173
03:40:31,219 --> 03:40:34,260
And the last probably 40 minutes is doing the old bit readings, right?

3174
03:40:34,459 --> 03:40:46,229
I played this for probably an hour.

3175
03:40:46,430 --> 03:40:48,149
How excited do I sound, you think?

3176
03:40:48,350 --> 03:40:53,729
Who, who, who fucking who cry, crying.

3177
03:40:53,930 --> 03:40:56,889
I'm tears are streaming down my face, angry.

3178
03:40:59,120 --> 03:40:59,840
Yeah.

3179
03:41:07,420 --> 03:41:09,299
Oh, wait, this is one of those plant, the trees.

3180
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:10,139
What is what it's going?

3181
03:41:10,340 --> 03:41:13,729
What does that make that clicking sound?

3182
03:41:21,909 --> 03:41:23,389
Isn't when they turned me into Darth Vader.

3183
03:41:23,389 --> 03:41:24,750
I was just going to say that in this part.

3184
03:41:24,950 --> 03:41:28,110
I was just going to say that I was just going to say that

3185
03:41:28,309 --> 03:41:39,979
is where I practice punching things.

3186
03:41:39,979 --> 03:41:40,579
Right.

3187
03:41:41,459 --> 03:41:42,180
All right, here we go.

3188
03:41:42,379 --> 03:41:47,250
How much do I hate it?

3189
03:41:47,450 --> 03:41:49,209
Press circle to heal.

3190
03:41:49,409 --> 03:41:51,049
Use your vital injection.

3191
03:41:52,190 --> 03:41:53,430
That's that's quick.

3192
03:41:53,629 --> 03:41:54,709
Our three is lock on.

3193
03:41:54,909 --> 03:41:55,709
Sure.

3194
03:41:55,909 --> 03:41:56,870
Our one is horizontal.

3195
03:41:57,069 --> 03:41:58,510
Our two is vertical.

3196
03:41:59,360 --> 03:42:03,219
OK, they can be going to be strung together.

3197
03:42:03,420 --> 03:42:03,979
OK.

3198
03:42:04,180 --> 03:42:04,979
Yeah.

3199
03:42:06,120 --> 03:42:09,200
Whoever made this game, fuck you.

3200
03:42:14,579 --> 03:42:15,379
Shit.

3201
03:42:19,540 --> 03:42:23,440
Um, I don't actually I don't actually mean that, by the way.

3202
03:42:23,440 --> 03:42:25,360
I was just like frustrated at the game.

3203
03:42:30,979 --> 03:42:31,620
Who made this game?

3204
03:42:31,819 --> 03:42:33,260
Fuck you. Dark Souls is way better.

3205
03:42:33,459 --> 03:42:35,219
Oh, my God, I'm such a dick.

3206
03:42:35,420 --> 03:42:36,540
What the hell?

3207
03:42:36,739 --> 03:42:38,100
What's wrong?

3208
03:42:38,299 --> 03:42:42,340
No, I'm this is not who I am.

3209
03:42:42,659 --> 03:42:50,100
Yeah, delete this, delete this from deleted.

3210
03:42:54,510 --> 03:42:56,030
Is he writing this right now?

3211
03:42:56,409 --> 03:42:59,250
Rhonic in a game like fucking stuff.

3212
03:43:02,569 --> 03:43:04,290
Why is there time based retrieval?

3213
03:43:04,489 --> 03:43:10,979
That's fucking moronic in a game like this.

3214
03:43:11,180 --> 03:43:12,219
All right.

3215
03:43:15,100 --> 03:43:17,620
I'm not throwing in the towel yet.

3216
03:43:18,379 --> 03:43:19,379
Not yet. Not yet.

3217
03:43:19,579 --> 03:43:28,350
Not yet. Toxic.

3218
03:43:28,549 --> 03:43:29,510
How much does this block?

3219
03:43:29,709 --> 03:43:34,540
OK, I gotta be very, very real with everybody here.

3220
03:43:34,739 --> 03:43:38,709
So this been a lot of times I've played a game

3221
03:43:38,829 --> 03:43:43,870
and on stream, I never I never want to like just like talk shit about like a game

3222
03:43:43,870 --> 03:43:45,110
company because you don't know. Right.

3223
03:43:45,309 --> 03:43:50,989
Like it just the game might not be for you or like maybe it's like it's better

3224
03:43:51,190 --> 03:43:54,389
later or maybe you just like have to learn if it's like it's a learning curve.

3225
03:43:54,829 --> 03:44:00,059
I always hate like talking shit on stream because like I

3226
03:44:00,260 --> 03:44:05,430
would I try to condense my rage to not get that far.

3227
03:44:05,430 --> 03:44:08,790
So when you hear me do that, when you ever hear me do that on this

3228
03:44:08,870 --> 03:44:16,299
broadcast, I it's I've been holding it in and I just have to fucking say something.

3229
03:44:17,510 --> 03:44:19,389
I've hit the boiling point at that point.

3230
03:44:20,280 --> 03:44:23,000
And sometimes it happens really quickly and sometimes it happens over an hour.

3231
03:44:23,700 --> 03:44:26,819
But I always try to like bottle it because I don't want to like obviously be

3232
03:44:26,819 --> 03:44:30,139
like a dick or anything, but like, holy shit, listen to this guy.

3233
03:44:36,270 --> 03:44:38,709
Stream looks like ass, too, by the way.

3234
03:44:39,149 --> 03:44:43,229
They stream it like 480p, but four years ago, five years ago.

3235
03:44:47,829 --> 03:44:49,590
Was it 720? It was probably 720.

3236
03:44:49,590 --> 03:44:52,690
While you can.

3237
03:44:52,889 --> 03:44:56,870
No, it's probably a low bit rate, though.

3238
03:44:59,100 --> 03:45:03,899
My bit rate that I'm doing is probably doubled since like 2015, 2016.

3239
03:45:09,270 --> 03:45:10,110
All right.

3240
03:45:11,000 --> 03:45:13,159
And wait, this guy might kill me.

3241
03:45:14,180 --> 03:45:15,100
Oh, I got hit.

3242
03:45:15,299 --> 03:45:16,700
Immediate anger.

3243
03:45:17,899 --> 03:45:18,579
Oh, I got hit.

3244
03:45:18,579 --> 03:45:20,260
Apparently, I didn't have invincibility.

3245
03:45:20,459 --> 03:45:23,180
Apparently, apparently, apparently.

3246
03:45:23,379 --> 03:45:25,340
And he's going to go, OK.

3247
03:45:27,319 --> 03:45:29,840
See, apparently means it's not my fault

3248
03:45:29,840 --> 03:45:32,399
that I got hit because, like, apparently you get hit if you do that.

3249
03:45:32,399 --> 03:45:34,520
Like, I'm it's not my fault, right?

3250
03:45:41,040 --> 03:45:42,040
It's this clip here.

3251
03:45:42,040 --> 03:45:44,840
Well, I mean, where is that in the time stamp of the stream?

3252
03:45:46,819 --> 03:45:48,579
I need a new weapon or something.

3253
03:45:48,780 --> 03:45:52,940
I'm literally in the stream right now.

3254
03:45:53,139 --> 03:45:54,340
No.

3255
03:45:56,530 --> 03:45:58,129
Oh, awful.

3256
03:46:00,690 --> 03:46:05,370
This game is fucking terrible, like a zero out of fucking 10.

3257
03:46:05,569 --> 03:46:07,450
It's awful.

3258
03:46:08,219 --> 03:46:09,420
Don't fucking buy this game.

3259
03:46:09,620 --> 03:46:11,059
Oh, my God. Dark Souls game.

3260
03:46:11,260 --> 03:46:14,500
Go play Dark Souls. This game sucks asshole.

3261
03:46:14,700 --> 03:46:16,899
I can't. This is awful.

3262
03:46:17,340 --> 03:46:20,059
This is awful. I would rather use like I would rather you.

3263
03:46:20,260 --> 03:46:23,299
No, I'm not going to say it because that's like lewd and fucked up.

3264
03:46:23,500 --> 03:46:24,500
What?

3265
03:46:25,319 --> 03:46:28,440
I was about to say something like fucked up right there.

3266
03:46:28,639 --> 03:46:35,479
So glad I didn't watch the rest of it.

3267
03:46:40,270 --> 03:46:41,629
I'm say it. Say it.

3268
03:46:41,829 --> 03:46:43,629
What am I? Don't say it. I don't know what he's going to say.

3269
03:46:43,829 --> 03:46:45,670
This game is just fucking bad.

3270
03:46:50,659 --> 03:46:52,180
How did this game get an eight?

3271
03:46:53,190 --> 03:46:54,229
Who gave this game an eight?

3272
03:46:54,430 --> 03:46:55,790
No, don't. Don't.

3273
03:46:55,989 --> 03:46:58,110
This is a fucking six game at best.

3274
03:46:58,309 --> 03:46:59,989
Maybe a five.

3275
03:47:02,989 --> 03:47:04,389
It's probably fine.

3276
03:47:04,389 --> 03:47:07,709
I'm just such a fucking over dramatic asshole.

3277
03:47:10,840 --> 03:47:14,280
I can't. What the fuck is even happening with this guy?

3278
03:47:19,840 --> 03:47:21,319
Oh, I don't know.

3279
03:47:21,520 --> 03:47:24,479
I was like, no, I'm speechless.

3280
03:47:24,680 --> 03:47:26,280
I'm just speechless.

3281
03:47:28,059 --> 03:47:29,500
We want all German.

3282
03:47:29,700 --> 03:47:36,659
No, I literally said fuck Capcom like six weeks ago.

3283
03:47:36,659 --> 03:47:37,819
What are you talking about?

3284
03:47:38,459 --> 03:47:39,899
He never left.

3285
03:47:54,420 --> 03:47:56,379
It's under it's try harder.

3286
03:47:56,579 --> 03:47:58,579
Oh, I'm almost there.

3287
03:47:58,739 --> 03:48:00,250
Somehow.

3288
03:48:00,450 --> 03:48:01,770
No, I don't want to hear it.

3289
03:48:01,770 --> 03:48:02,690
Two health bars.

3290
03:48:02,690 --> 03:48:04,290
First game of two thousand.

3291
03:48:04,290 --> 03:48:05,450
I don't want to hear it.

3292
03:48:06,020 --> 03:48:07,180
What if I don't want to hear it, though?

3293
03:48:07,379 --> 03:48:08,379
I don't want to hear it.

3294
03:48:08,819 --> 03:48:09,899
I fucking hate this game.

3295
03:48:10,100 --> 03:48:11,700
I hate this game.

3296
03:48:12,389 --> 03:48:15,909
I think that honestly, this is the first game of 2017 that I fucking despise.

3297
03:48:16,110 --> 03:48:19,299
I hate this game.

3298
03:48:19,940 --> 03:48:22,940
I fucking hate this game.

3299
03:48:23,139 --> 03:48:24,940
This must have been so miserable to watch live.

3300
03:48:25,139 --> 03:48:28,180
This is the first game of 2017 that I fucking hate.

3301
03:48:28,379 --> 03:48:29,700
Oh, listen to that. Fuck.

3302
03:48:30,079 --> 03:48:31,840
That's not like, oh, I fucking hate this.

3303
03:48:31,959 --> 03:48:33,440
That's I fucking.

3304
03:48:33,639 --> 03:48:35,079
I fucking hate this.

3305
03:48:35,280 --> 03:48:36,040
Wow.

3306
03:48:37,889 --> 03:48:39,450
If you want to add a list, make a list.

3307
03:48:39,649 --> 03:48:40,770
This is the first one.

3308
03:48:47,989 --> 03:48:49,469
No, I didn't.

3309
03:48:49,670 --> 03:48:53,350
Outlast 2 was like I wasn't a wasn't a huge fan of it, but it was, you know,

3310
03:48:53,549 --> 03:48:54,829
it was it was all right. I didn't mind it.

3311
03:48:55,030 --> 03:48:56,149
It was OK.

3312
03:48:57,489 --> 03:48:59,450
Outlast 2 was like,

3313
03:48:59,649 --> 03:49:02,809
it wasn't really like it was didn't feel like I said a lot of swears and stuff.

3314
03:49:03,010 --> 03:49:04,729
But, you know, what?

3315
03:49:04,930 --> 03:49:06,729
What are you talking about?

3316
03:49:06,930 --> 03:49:07,889
What are you talking about?

3317
03:49:08,090 --> 03:49:09,290
I hate this game.

3318
03:49:13,860 --> 03:49:16,579
I didn't say any squares funny in some places.

3319
03:49:16,780 --> 03:49:17,819
It was like fun.

3320
03:49:18,840 --> 03:49:21,120
Well, I don't think it was as good as the first game, but I didn't.

3321
03:49:21,319 --> 03:49:22,840
Like I enjoyed it.

3322
03:49:23,040 --> 03:49:26,479
OK, so when I say this thing, I give it like a stamp of recommended.

3323
03:49:26,680 --> 03:49:28,719
If you like those games, right?

3324
03:49:30,950 --> 03:49:32,909
But for me, for me, for at least this year,

3325
03:49:33,110 --> 03:49:36,069
this is the first true game sucks like for me.

3326
03:49:36,770 --> 03:49:38,569
This was the first year that I watched the screen.

3327
03:49:38,770 --> 03:49:40,729
You are more than welcome to enjoy this game.

3328
03:49:40,930 --> 03:49:42,290
It's one fifty three.

3329
03:49:42,290 --> 03:49:43,409
You bought it. I hope you love it.

3330
03:49:43,979 --> 03:49:45,540
Real boss. That was the asylum demon.

3331
03:49:45,739 --> 03:49:46,819
What? Oh, my God.

3332
03:49:46,819 --> 03:49:48,500
It's just this is like 30 straight minutes.

3333
03:49:48,700 --> 03:49:50,540
Thank you for the hundred dollars.

3334
03:49:50,739 --> 03:49:52,100
Thank you.

3335
03:49:52,299 --> 03:49:54,059
Thanks for the hundred dollars.

3336
03:49:54,059 --> 03:49:56,579
Like, what the hell? What is going on in this video?

3337
03:50:00,600 --> 03:50:03,120
Where is it? One fifty three lift in the boss room stops.

3338
03:50:03,319 --> 03:50:05,280
Channel switched microphone.

3339
03:50:05,479 --> 03:50:08,370
Hey, you here?

3340
03:50:08,569 --> 03:50:10,489
Am I talking to I am here?

3341
03:50:10,690 --> 03:50:12,969
OK, I was told that you needed saving.

3342
03:50:13,170 --> 03:50:15,690
This is the worst game I've ever played.

3343
03:50:15,889 --> 03:50:19,690
Really is that the first one you turn you up first to Alex.

3344
03:50:19,889 --> 03:50:22,129
This is the worst game I've ever played.

3345
03:50:22,690 --> 03:50:24,329
You sound very quiet to me.

3346
03:50:24,530 --> 03:50:26,010
I'm very quiet.

3347
03:50:26,209 --> 03:50:28,290
Yeah. Hold on, turn me up.

3348
03:50:28,489 --> 03:50:32,729
I am what I want to go like rant to six decibels.

3349
03:50:32,930 --> 03:50:35,129
Well, did I like call one of my friends

3350
03:50:35,129 --> 03:50:37,610
to like I was so upset that I had to like rant at him?

3351
03:50:38,180 --> 03:50:40,020
Why? Why would I want to stream this?

3352
03:50:40,219 --> 03:50:41,219
No, I got to turn again.

3353
03:50:41,420 --> 03:50:42,540
I got to turn you down.

3354
03:50:42,979 --> 03:50:44,620
Oh, I'm a loud boy.

3355
03:50:45,569 --> 03:50:48,409
I turned him way too far down.

3356
03:50:49,940 --> 03:50:51,620
You shouldn't. Why are people saying there's an echo?

3357
03:50:51,819 --> 03:50:53,860
I'm going to mute my mic.

3358
03:50:55,540 --> 03:50:56,979
When does this quote happen?

3359
03:50:57,180 --> 03:50:58,420
Friday the 14th.

3360
03:51:00,459 --> 03:51:03,020
Where's this quote? You guys you're linking me wrong stuff.

3361
03:51:03,219 --> 03:51:12,569
One forty three.

3362
03:51:22,159 --> 03:51:24,440
Down on your fucking hands.

3363
03:51:25,520 --> 03:51:27,719
One forty four.

3364
03:51:27,920 --> 03:51:29,920
You guys, you guys are saying random numbers.

3365
03:51:30,120 --> 03:51:31,079
What?

3366
03:51:32,219 --> 03:51:34,100
I'm done. I'm done playing.

3367
03:51:37,549 --> 03:51:39,309
This is a fun game. Italics, where are you?

3368
03:51:43,079 --> 03:51:45,409
Italics, where are you? Are you here?

3369
03:51:54,229 --> 03:51:56,389
I tried to warn you. I played for an hour and refunded.

3370
03:51:56,430 --> 03:51:59,159
Italics, where are you?

3371
03:51:59,360 --> 03:52:02,530
You made the surge on stream.

3372
03:52:02,729 --> 03:52:04,530
Just watch the clip.

3373
03:52:08,040 --> 03:52:09,719
Why are you referencing Bible verses?

3374
03:52:09,719 --> 03:52:11,120
What are you talking about?

3375
03:52:11,319 --> 03:52:13,239
Fuck this game. I don't even care if I won.

3376
03:52:13,239 --> 03:52:14,440
And I feel like good about winning.

3377
03:52:14,440 --> 03:52:15,200
No, I don't. I don't.

3378
03:52:15,200 --> 03:52:16,239
It was like the tutorial boss.

3379
03:52:16,239 --> 03:52:17,360
That was the asylum demon.

3380
03:52:17,559 --> 03:52:19,079
Why? I don't care.

3381
03:52:20,219 --> 03:52:21,100
This game doesn't suck.

3382
03:52:21,100 --> 03:52:22,260
I'm sorry for saying that.

3383
03:52:22,260 --> 03:52:24,579
If you're like a developer and you're watching this game,

3384
03:52:26,750 --> 03:52:29,149
try fucking harder next time.

3385
03:52:33,940 --> 03:52:37,860
Oh, my God.

3386
03:52:38,020 --> 03:52:40,819
Oh, my God.

3387
03:52:45,360 --> 03:52:52,079
OK, so I'm going to say that it should probably

3388
03:52:52,280 --> 03:52:59,670
on the on the tier list, the surge should probably be on a game that I couldn't beat.

3389
03:52:59,870 --> 03:53:03,819
I can't beat.

3390
03:53:06,059 --> 03:53:07,139
Whoo.

3391
03:53:13,909 --> 03:53:17,670
OK, you know, like, you know, OK, like

3392
03:53:29,629 --> 03:53:30,790
I have to get out of here.

3393
03:53:30,989 --> 03:53:31,750
I have to get out of here.

3394
03:53:31,950 --> 03:53:33,110
I'm not allowed on here.

3395
03:53:34,000 --> 03:53:36,159
All right. Oh, this is F zero.

3396
03:53:36,360 --> 03:53:37,760
I never played F zero.

3397
03:53:39,760 --> 03:53:40,719
Oh, I did.

3398
03:53:40,920 --> 03:53:43,840
I hated Neo as well, didn't I?

3399
03:53:45,430 --> 03:53:50,850
I didn't I talk a bunch of shit about this game too?

3400
03:53:51,049 --> 03:53:53,979
No,

3401
03:53:54,180 --> 03:53:55,340
I did.

3402
03:53:55,540 --> 03:53:57,700
I remember being like this fucking game, like fucking sucks.

3403
03:53:57,899 --> 03:54:00,020
No, no, I couldn't do it.

3404
03:54:07,440 --> 03:54:10,440
No, to be fair, I was like shit faced when I played this game, wasn't I?

3405
03:54:10,940 --> 03:54:18,450
No, no, we're moving on.

3406
03:54:20,620 --> 03:54:25,809
What is this one?

3407
03:54:26,010 --> 03:54:29,090
I remember people saying, hey, you should go play Neo 2.

3408
03:54:30,739 --> 03:54:32,700
I don't think so.

3409
03:54:34,000 --> 03:54:36,159
I don't think that's going to happen.

3410
03:54:39,100 --> 03:54:40,940
No, I've not seen it.

3411
03:54:41,379 --> 03:54:42,500
No, I've not seen it.

3412
03:54:42,579 --> 03:54:43,500
I'm not looking at it.

3413
03:54:47,200 --> 03:54:48,479
I'm going to go pee. I'm peeing.

3414
03:54:48,680 --> 03:54:49,799
I'm not even here. I'm leaving.

3415
03:54:55,680 --> 03:57:49,020
I got to pee.

3416
03:58:04,139 --> 03:58:06,620
Yeah, but I've heard me say it.

3417
03:58:06,819 --> 03:58:08,860
You can cut that shit. No, don't.

3418
03:58:09,059 --> 03:58:10,260
You don't have to.

3419
03:58:11,340 --> 03:58:14,149
You don't have to.

3420
03:58:14,350 --> 03:58:15,389
You don't have to.

3421
03:58:15,590 --> 03:58:18,940
I'm certain of it.

3422
03:58:21,799 --> 03:58:23,239
I don't know.

3423
03:58:28,540 --> 03:58:31,979
OK, 2017 in Germany was mean.

3424
03:58:39,139 --> 03:58:40,579
I don't think so.

3425
03:58:40,780 --> 03:58:42,420
Have I gotten less mean?

3426
03:58:42,620 --> 03:58:44,379
Was I mean? Maybe I was.

3427
03:58:44,579 --> 03:58:45,579
No, I wasn't.

3428
03:58:49,610 --> 03:58:51,250
I well.

3429
03:58:52,200 --> 03:58:55,850
All right, let's finish this.

3430
03:58:56,219 --> 03:58:57,979
And then I'm going to move on from Tierless.

3431
03:58:57,979 --> 03:58:59,459
I want to play a couple of these little games.

3432
03:59:05,180 --> 03:59:09,659
I want to I want to play some of these little like browser games.

3433
03:59:12,780 --> 03:59:14,299
That's not supposed to still be on.

3434
03:59:17,750 --> 03:59:20,950
Oh, but the Deltarune soundtrack back on, please.

3435
03:59:21,149 --> 03:59:35,579
Yep.

3436
03:59:42,739 --> 03:59:46,340
Toby Fox is the Mozart of fucking like this generation.

3437
03:59:48,180 --> 03:59:49,459
All right.

3438
03:59:53,420 --> 04:00:01,500
Over here. All right.

3439
04:00:03,540 --> 04:00:05,899
Deltarune OST is on again.

3440
04:00:07,819 --> 04:00:10,739
Odd hand, I know people really want me to play this, but I just didn't.

3441
04:00:10,940 --> 04:00:14,819
I kept. No, don't put me another one.

3442
04:00:26,260 --> 04:00:27,219
I did it again.

3443
04:00:28,559 --> 04:00:32,399
I talk about how much this game sucks and how it's fucking terrible.

3444
04:00:45,510 --> 04:00:47,909
Is this is it in this clip?

3445
04:01:01,600 --> 04:01:05,239
I just think I'm when I play hard games, I just get really, really mad.

3446
04:01:06,450 --> 04:01:07,729
I just get things just piss me off.

3447
04:01:08,680 --> 04:01:10,760
I don't know why. Like, I just get so infuriated.

3448
04:01:15,229 --> 04:01:17,270
Requested this game a million times.

3449
04:01:17,469 --> 04:01:18,709
Are you here?

3450
04:01:18,909 --> 04:01:25,549
The only reason why I'm doing a fighting game in the arcade.

3451
04:01:28,209 --> 04:01:29,250
Stinger.

3452
04:01:29,450 --> 04:01:30,850
What is it? What is that?

3453
04:01:31,049 --> 04:01:32,530
What button is that supposed to be?

3454
04:01:34,250 --> 04:01:35,649
Pretty good DDT.

3455
04:01:36,280 --> 04:01:40,290
He's not here.

3456
04:01:44,299 --> 04:01:45,260
He's not even here.

3457
04:01:45,459 --> 04:01:49,819
He's going to shit his pants when he realizes he missed this stream.

3458
04:01:50,020 --> 04:01:52,059
But I hope the guy is here.

3459
04:01:52,260 --> 04:01:54,780
That is requested this game a million times.

3460
04:02:02,840 --> 04:02:07,200
There's not any more clips of me talking about how like, oh, yeah, there is.

3461
04:02:07,399 --> 04:02:10,520
These are every game on this list.

3462
04:02:10,680 --> 04:02:12,159
Don't you understand, guys?

3463
04:02:12,600 --> 04:02:17,040
Every single game on this list, there is a whole vod of me talking about how much

3464
04:02:17,239 --> 04:02:19,959
the game is a piece of shit and how I fucking hate it.

3465
04:02:20,159 --> 04:02:21,959
And it's like the worst game I've ever played.

3466
04:02:22,659 --> 04:02:24,180
Everyone on this list.

3467
04:02:33,319 --> 04:02:36,680
That was really high, though.

3468
04:02:38,979 --> 04:02:39,979
I didn't beat this one.

3469
04:02:41,309 --> 04:02:43,110
I did not beat getting over it.

3470
04:02:46,690 --> 04:02:48,530
Show the hit and run meltdown clip.

3471
04:02:48,729 --> 04:02:50,649
It's the whole broadcast.

3472
04:02:51,600 --> 04:02:53,799
It's the entire broadcast.

3473
04:02:54,000 --> 04:02:56,600
It's like that was like a 12 hour stream.

3474
04:02:57,190 --> 04:02:59,149
After the first 45 minutes, it's all it was.

3475
04:02:59,350 --> 04:03:01,270
I probably, you know, that stream,

3476
04:03:01,709 --> 04:03:06,030
Simpsons Hit and Run, that one day of streaming Simpsons Hit and Run,

3477
04:03:06,229 --> 04:03:11,030
I believe was the equivalent of me smoking five to six thousand packs of cigarettes.

3478
04:03:11,229 --> 04:03:13,190
That's like the amount of damage it did to my life.

3479
04:03:13,389 --> 04:03:15,069
That's the amount of damage it did to my brain.

3480
04:03:21,979 --> 04:03:25,659
Like, if I went to get like a chest x-ray, they'd be like, what happened?

3481
04:03:25,860 --> 04:03:27,100
Do you smoke?

3482
04:03:27,469 --> 04:03:28,870
Do you smoke cigarettes?

3483
04:03:28,870 --> 04:03:30,750
It looks like you've been a smoker for a long time.

3484
04:03:31,129 --> 04:03:33,370
I'd be like, no, I haven't smoked ever in my whole life.

3485
04:03:34,409 --> 04:03:36,959
Oh, well, what happened then?

3486
04:03:37,159 --> 04:03:41,750
Well, you know, a few of these fucking games that are hard games like Simpsons

3487
04:03:41,950 --> 04:03:48,290
Hit and Run, like I would have damage that you could see on like an x-ray.

3488
04:03:52,629 --> 04:03:57,420
Anyways, I didn't play this.

3489
04:03:57,620 --> 04:04:07,770
Oh, there's a clip in that one, too,

3490
04:04:07,969 --> 04:04:10,489
when I talk about how stupid the devs are.

3491
04:04:11,379 --> 04:04:14,180
Oh, this is like a horrible epiphany I'm having.

3492
04:04:14,379 --> 04:04:18,659
This is like I'm being I'm being shown all of my demons at once.

3493
04:04:19,540 --> 04:04:21,459
He's sweating. Yeah, it's fucking hot.

3494
04:04:24,909 --> 04:04:26,670
Yeah, there's a part where I'm in the steam room and I'm like,

3495
04:04:26,870 --> 04:04:29,709
this is the worst game I've ever played, like all the devs are fucking morons.

3496
04:04:33,930 --> 04:04:43,110
Like I am being shown all of my bullshit right now.

3497
04:04:43,309 --> 04:04:46,110
I mean, Hotline Miami 2 was so unbearable.

3498
04:04:46,549 --> 04:04:47,790
I would put it here.

3499
04:04:47,989 --> 04:04:49,149
But at least I beat it.

3500
04:04:50,739 --> 04:04:52,420
Was that worse than Hit Simpsons?

3501
04:04:52,620 --> 04:04:59,500
Probably not.

3502
04:04:59,700 --> 04:05:03,340
I haven't played Ghouls and Ghosts.

3503
04:05:03,540 --> 04:05:04,819
My summer car.

3504
04:05:06,020 --> 04:05:09,780
I mean, I played it, but I thought it wasn't like hard or anything, was it?

3505
04:05:11,700 --> 04:05:16,260
Don't Starve didn't really play it, didn't play Boshi, didn't play Spelunky.

3506
04:05:16,299 --> 04:05:17,979
I'm just going to pick up things that I played.

3507
04:05:18,180 --> 04:05:19,979
This game was annoying, but at least I beat it.

3508
04:05:22,139 --> 04:05:24,020
Play Dead Cells.

3509
04:05:24,219 --> 04:05:26,100
All Mario. Oh, no, don't say that.

3510
04:05:36,079 --> 04:05:40,120
I was going to say that all Mario carts.

3511
04:05:41,329 --> 04:05:47,379
No, no, I'm this is 2021 not toxic.

3512
04:05:47,579 --> 04:05:48,819
I am not toxic.

3513
04:05:48,819 --> 04:05:53,120
I am going to give everybody the benefit of the doubt and I'm not going to say

3514
04:05:53,319 --> 04:06:00,829
anything and I was going to tell you that after the let's say since they OK,

3515
04:06:01,870 --> 04:06:05,149
since Nintendo started coming up with consoles that you shook around a controller,

3516
04:06:05,719 --> 04:06:09,610
they've been awful. Don't hurt me, please don't hurt me.

3517
04:06:32,319 --> 04:06:45,979
OK, your Thanksgiving tier list was awful, but this is a redemption.

3518
04:06:47,889 --> 04:06:53,629
Dark Souls 2 is it's kind of I don't know if it was harder than all these,

3519
04:06:53,829 --> 04:07:01,860
but it was it was a lot of stuff going on and I wasn't a big fan of Dark Souls 2.

3520
04:07:02,819 --> 04:07:06,940
Darkest Dungeon was really annoying, but it was still doable.

3521
04:07:07,629 --> 04:07:08,670
Although now I never beat it.

3522
04:07:08,829 --> 04:07:10,430
I actually did not beat the Darkest Dungeon.

3523
04:07:10,430 --> 04:07:14,909
I did not. I didn't play this.

3524
04:07:14,909 --> 04:07:16,909
We play this and played and played and played and not played.

3525
04:07:17,110 --> 04:07:22,219
Not not not not not not not not.

3526
04:07:22,909 --> 04:07:24,709
No,

3527
04:07:36,610 --> 04:07:37,569
no comment.

3528
04:07:38,329 --> 04:07:39,530
Oh,

3529
04:07:45,979 --> 04:07:47,219
hmm.

3530
04:07:48,819 --> 04:07:51,020
Dark Souls 3 is up here somewhere.

3531
04:07:52,739 --> 04:07:54,260
Oh, boy, this one was bad.

3532
04:07:55,139 --> 04:07:57,139
Did I beat I beat Lifeline, though I beat it.

3533
04:08:01,680 --> 04:08:03,040
Punch out.

3534
04:08:05,139 --> 04:08:06,700
Mario Tennis Aces.

3535
04:08:14,239 --> 04:08:15,399
I'm going to want to link the clip where

3536
04:08:15,399 --> 04:08:19,479
I talk about what I'm talking shit to the kid like I'm making fun of a fake child.

3537
04:08:20,440 --> 04:08:22,920
Damn, I really was fucked up.

3538
04:08:24,319 --> 04:08:25,000
Holy shit.

3539
04:08:25,200 --> 04:08:30,879
I'm like, look at these are all these things were from like 2016 to like 2018,

3540
04:08:31,379 --> 04:08:36,420
like 2019, I was mean and rude to people.

3541
04:08:36,620 --> 04:08:38,299
I still am. Well, am I?

3542
04:08:38,500 --> 04:08:40,920
No, I'm not.

3543
04:08:41,120 --> 04:08:41,879
This is the one, right?

3544
04:08:46,030 --> 04:08:47,909
No, I know. I'm fine.

3545
04:08:48,110 --> 04:08:48,709
Fine.

3546
04:08:54,909 --> 04:08:56,670
But I hope the guy is here.

3547
04:09:00,629 --> 04:09:02,030
This is the clip. I think it is.

3548
04:09:08,940 --> 04:09:10,579
Good job, Nicholas.

3549
04:09:10,780 --> 04:09:13,180
Good luck in the first grade next week.

3550
04:09:15,149 --> 04:09:16,549
Damn it, man.

3551
04:09:18,680 --> 04:09:20,120
Now, this is not the clip.

3552
04:09:20,690 --> 04:09:22,809
This is not the right. I mean, that's mean.

3553
04:09:23,440 --> 04:09:24,680
Good job, Nicholas.

3554
04:09:24,879 --> 04:09:27,040
I mean, that was kind of rude, but I

3555
04:09:29,530 --> 04:09:33,610
it was like I said a lot more awful things, I think, on this one.

3556
04:09:40,319 --> 04:09:42,399
You got destroyed by a first grader.

3557
04:09:44,569 --> 04:09:45,409
All right. I'm playing it.

3558
04:09:45,610 --> 04:09:47,889
I'm done with Tierless. I'm done with Tierless.

3559
04:09:48,090 --> 04:09:49,250
It's too I don't like this.

3560
04:09:49,450 --> 04:09:51,780
I'm done. Portal 2 was a lot of fun.

3561
04:09:51,979 --> 04:09:54,579
It was balanced.

3562
04:09:56,709 --> 04:09:58,430
Which Ninja Turtles game is this?

3563
04:09:58,629 --> 04:10:00,549
Because they were they were always really fun, balanced.

3564
04:10:02,059 --> 04:10:03,180
Buster Truck never played it.

3565
04:10:03,379 --> 04:10:07,299
Chilly Time is actually uncompletable, so that's fine.

3566
04:10:10,620 --> 04:10:11,260
There you go.

3567
04:10:12,139 --> 04:10:15,040
Now we're going to play

3568
04:10:15,239 --> 04:10:16,920
a little browser game.

3569
04:10:18,190 --> 04:10:21,100
There's a couple here.

3570
04:10:21,299 --> 04:10:25,110
Let's do this one, but find the U.S.

3571
04:10:25,309 --> 04:10:26,950
States with no outline.

3572
04:10:26,950 --> 04:10:28,030
This is you know what?

3573
04:10:28,030 --> 04:10:29,629
I've said to myself I probably shouldn't

3574
04:10:29,829 --> 04:10:33,049
do this because I don't think I can do it.

3575
04:10:34,059 --> 04:10:35,100
I did not practice.

3576
04:10:35,299 --> 04:10:35,860
I promise.

3577
04:10:36,239 --> 04:10:37,840
I really don't think I can do this.

3578
04:10:38,040 --> 04:10:40,360
I don't think it's possible.

3579
04:10:41,850 --> 04:10:47,840
North Carolina, Vermont.

3580
04:10:48,040 --> 04:10:49,799
That's what I clicked. I just clicked right there.

3581
04:10:50,690 --> 04:10:57,469
What the fuck was that?

3582
04:10:57,979 --> 04:11:11,860
Arkansas.

3583
04:11:12,549 --> 04:11:13,430

Iowa is like here.

3585
04:11:18,870 --> 04:11:21,670
Fuck. I'm like I get every time I think

3586
04:11:22,940 --> 04:11:26,940
of where a state is, it's one inch to the right of where I'm going to click.

3587
04:11:34,809 --> 04:11:42,409
Idaho, Vermont, Mississippi is right here somewhere.

3588
04:11:42,610 --> 04:11:43,649

Fuck you.

3599
04:12:23,700 --> 04:12:24,899
Stop restarting.

3600
04:12:25,409 --> 04:12:27,049
Oh, I thought I had to restart.

3601
04:12:28,260 --> 04:12:31,500
I do have to restart.

3602
04:12:31,700 --> 04:12:32,620
I mean, stop restarting.

3603
04:12:32,819 --> 04:12:34,459
I have to replay the quiz.

3604
04:12:40,340 --> 04:12:41,420

Is it going to be so hard?

3619
04:13:45,620 --> 04:13:47,020
You need to get the outline first.

3620
04:13:48,700 --> 04:13:49,739
Missouri is here.

3621
04:13:49,940 --> 04:13:51,100

Jesus, I don't know.

3631
04:14:12,149 --> 04:14:13,709
They're such small states over here.

3632
04:14:14,409 --> 04:14:15,209
Like right here.

3633
04:14:15,409 --> 04:14:16,969

04:14:35,379 --> 04:14:36,819
This is in that Delaware.

3638
04:14:37,020 --> 04:14:38,059
They're the same shape.

3639
04:14:44,899 --> 04:14:46,180
Maryland here.

3640
04:14:46,379 --> 04:14:47,340

There it is. Georgia here.

Oh, I just don't remember.

3645
04:14:58,069 --> 04:14:59,790
It's like what a weird shape.

3646
04:15:01,510 --> 04:15:05,829
I know it's like here, but this that's such an odd shape.

3647
04:15:07,299 --> 04:15:09,379
It's such a small, weird shape.

3648
04:15:12,700 --> 04:15:14,500
Fuck the founding father, Rhode Island.

3649
04:15:14,700 --> 04:15:16,260
Like it's so tiny over here.

3650
04:15:16,629 --> 04:15:18,350
How I could miss click so easily.

3651
04:15:18,510 --> 04:15:19,350
Oklahoma.

3652
04:15:19,790 --> 04:15:21,110
Texas is right here. Oklahoma.

It should be at least Tennessee.

3655
04:15:29,649 --> 04:15:30,530
Oh, my God.

3656
04:15:30,530 --> 04:15:31,329
I'm never going to get it.

3657
04:15:31,530 --> 04:15:33,889
I don't think I'll ever be like I'm never going to be able to do this.

3658
04:15:35,610 --> 04:15:36,770
Wyoming is here.

3659
04:15:36,969 --> 04:15:40,860

Georgia, Oregon, New Jersey, Nebraska was here.

3661
04:15:54,639 --> 04:15:59,700
Even when it shows me, guys, it doesn't matter because it's without the outlines.

3662
04:15:59,899 --> 04:16:04,379
I don't I don't know what you can cycle.

3663
04:16:05,010 --> 04:16:06,889
Holy shit, I did not know that.

3664
04:16:07,879 --> 04:16:08,719
Tennessee.

3665
04:16:08,920 --> 04:16:10,040
Holy shit. All right. All right.

Right. Right. Arizona, Florida.

3667
04:16:16,459 --> 04:16:17,620

04:16:18,250 --> 04:16:20,520
Delaware. Nope. North Carolina.

3669
04:16:20,719 --> 04:16:22,040

That's the easiest state in the country.

3675
04:16:39,540 --> 04:16:41,139
What I clicked right here.

3676
04:16:48,049 --> 04:16:49,489

OK, slow down.

3701
04:18:24,790 --> 04:18:26,069
Just slow down. I can get it.

3702
04:18:26,829 --> 04:18:27,750
Just have to start filling it in.

3703
04:18:27,950 --> 04:18:29,469
North Dakota is right here.

3704
04:18:29,670 --> 04:18:31,629

That's New Jersey. Maryland.

3714
04:19:03,940 --> 04:19:05,700
I fucking hate this game.

3715
04:19:05,899 --> 04:19:08,299
Like, that's what I'm clicking on.

3716
04:19:12,260 --> 04:19:14,659
Like, I clicked right there.

3717
04:19:14,860 --> 04:19:16,659
I'm just going to go. It's right underneath Pennsylvania.

I'm going to set up this Maryland.

3719
04:19:30,899 --> 04:19:32,020
There it is.

3720
04:19:32,219 --> 04:19:34,420
I fucking hate the state.

3721
04:19:44,389 --> 04:19:48,090
But what is this like?

3722
04:19:48,290 --> 04:19:55,200
It's all the states should be equal cubes across the whole country.

3723
04:19:55,399 --> 04:20:07,520
Equal cubes, just cubes, cube Andy.

3724
04:20:09,370 --> 04:20:11,049
I've got to get this right. It's right.

3725
04:20:23,260 --> 04:20:24,579
I'm going to get this, I swear to God.

3726
04:20:24,620 --> 04:20:28,540

Oh, my God.

3728
04:20:30,500 --> 04:20:35,700
Where is this fucking ghost of a state that I keep missing somehow?

3729
04:20:41,829 --> 04:20:44,069
I'm just not going to fill it into the very end because, like, obviously,

3730
04:20:44,270 --> 04:20:53,059
I can't do it. New Jersey, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia.

3731
04:20:59,059 --> 04:21:02,260
I almost clicked on Texas, Massachusetts.

3732
04:21:02,459 --> 04:21:06,559
Let's just I got to slow down Idaho.

3733
04:21:11,860 --> 04:21:13,379
Don't click it. I refuse.

3734
04:21:15,739 --> 04:21:24,819
Fuck out of here. Michigan is this one, right?

3735
04:21:25,450 --> 04:21:26,729
No, that's the cheese one.

3736
04:21:26,850 --> 04:21:29,270
Wisconsin, they're both right here.

Delaware, I don't remember which one is the one that's right.

3739
04:21:38,940 --> 04:21:44,760
Which one's here? Pennsylvania.

3740
04:21:45,260 --> 04:21:46,180
All right. Connecticut.

3741
04:21:46,379 --> 04:21:48,620
Don't miss click. It's right there.

3742
04:21:50,920 --> 04:21:56,719
Hawaii, Nevada, Texas, Ohio.

3743
04:21:57,540 --> 04:22:00,020
Don't do Colorado yet, even though I know it's right here.

3744
04:22:00,219 --> 04:22:01,340
OK, we're good.

Thank you. Utah, Washington.

3747
04:22:08,670 --> 04:22:10,190
We have the whole West Coast done.

3748
04:22:15,299 --> 04:22:19,680
North Dakota.

3749
04:22:19,879 --> 04:22:23,100
No, it's this is Illinois right here.

3750
04:22:23,299 --> 04:22:42,100
Indiana, Indiana, Illinois, South Carolina, Florida, Maine, Ohio, Illinois, Illinois.

3751
04:22:42,100 --> 04:22:43,219
What's right next to Ohio?

3752
04:22:43,420 --> 04:22:45,299
Is it Illinois or is it Indiana?

3753
04:22:45,860 --> 04:22:47,100
I think it's Illinois.

3754
04:22:47,989 --> 04:23:00,870
I don't remember. Delaware is right there.

3755
04:23:01,069 --> 04:23:09,950
OK, Oklahoma is right above Texas, right? Right?

3756
04:23:10,520 --> 04:23:14,579
Yeah. Louisiana is right here.

3757
04:23:14,780 --> 04:23:17,329
Please. Yes, North Carolina.

3758
04:23:17,450 --> 04:23:20,790
All right. Is that Virginia or is that North Carolina?

3759
04:23:20,790 --> 04:23:22,989
Because it's North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia.

3760
04:23:23,190 --> 04:23:25,840
I think that's Virginia and North Carolina is right here.

3761
04:23:40,100 --> 04:23:46,139
Colorado, Kentucky is like here or here.

3762

And I see is right above Georgia.

3763
04:23:49,729 --> 04:23:56,440
I think it borders Georgia, Ohio, Illinois.

3764
04:24:13,389 --> 04:24:14,909
I clicked that fucking thing.

3765
04:24:52,469 --> 04:24:53,709
Oh, I missed it.

3766
04:24:53,909 --> 04:24:54,909

I don't know. Florida, Wisconsin, Oregon, New Hampshire, Delaware.

3770
04:25:12,110 --> 04:25:13,989
Don't. Yeah. Delaware is this little one right here.

3771
04:25:15,200 --> 04:25:16,719
Idaho. Wait. Yes.

04:25:38,979 --> 04:25:42,180
There's just such a it's such a bunch of weird shapes over here.

3776
04:25:52,030 --> 04:25:53,110
You hate the Midwest.

3777
04:25:53,309 --> 04:25:56,030
I just never I there's no I've never been there.

3778
04:25:58,899 --> 04:26:00,180
Well, I mean, that's hold on.

3779
04:26:00,750 --> 04:26:01,469
That's not true.

3780
04:26:02,040 --> 04:26:04,659
Mississippi is I don't know.

3781
04:26:07,110 --> 04:26:12,559
I believe this is Wyoming, Wyoming or these are Wyoming, Wyoming and Montana.

3782
04:26:12,559 --> 04:26:13,399
And I don't know which one.

3783
04:26:18,129 --> 04:26:18,850
All right. I got it.

3784
04:26:20,440 --> 04:26:23,280
North Dakota. It's like right here, but I don't know what the borders.

3785
04:26:26,340 --> 04:26:27,579
It's constant is right here.

3786
04:26:28,149 --> 04:26:29,270
All right. I got that.

3787
04:26:30,100 --> 04:26:32,459
South Dakota is above Oklahoma.

3788
04:26:34,430 --> 04:26:36,110
Iowa is like here.

3789
04:26:37,000 --> 04:26:38,040
Kentucky is here.

3790
04:26:38,239 --> 04:26:39,120
That's Kentucky.

3791
04:26:40,389 --> 04:26:41,430
All right. Hold on.

3792
04:26:47,180 --> 04:26:49,739
And this is like here, right?

3793
04:26:49,940 --> 04:26:54,139
We're here in your shit.

3794
04:26:57,139 --> 04:26:59,239
And that's this is West Virginia.

3795
04:27:02,180 --> 04:27:03,780
I know this is Mississippi or Alabama.

3796
04:27:03,780 --> 04:27:07,860
I just don't remember going a friend.

3797
04:27:08,059 --> 04:27:10,979
No, I'm going for it.

3798
04:27:10,979 --> 04:27:12,139
If I get it wrong, I'm just going to skip.

3799
04:27:12,139 --> 04:27:12,780
I don't even care.

3800
04:27:14,049 --> 04:27:16,610
So North Carolina, South Carolina.

3801
04:27:17,180 --> 04:27:18,780
Yep. West Virginia.

3802
04:27:19,409 --> 04:27:21,780
OK, we're getting there.

3803
04:27:25,030 --> 04:27:26,350
Let me finish the right side here.

3804
04:27:26,549 --> 04:27:28,430
North Carolina is here.

3805
04:27:30,469 --> 04:27:31,909
Virginia here.

3806
04:27:33,629 --> 04:27:35,149
We're getting there. Almost there.

3807
04:27:35,530 --> 04:27:37,969
Now it's just all these things that I have no goddamn idea.

3808
04:27:46,409 --> 04:27:54,100
Alabama, Mississippi, Alabama or Alabama, Mississippi.

3809
04:28:01,379 --> 04:28:02,780
North Dakota is north.

3810
04:28:02,860 --> 04:28:03,540
Yeah, I know.

3811
04:28:03,540 --> 04:28:07,500
But I don't know exactly where the borders are because like Wyoming is huge.

3812
04:28:07,700 --> 04:28:08,899
Montana is huge, aren't they?

3813
04:28:09,340 --> 04:28:10,500
It's like here.

3814
04:28:11,649 --> 04:28:12,530
I got it. OK.

3815
04:28:15,979 --> 04:28:18,579
So what is next to North Dakota?

3816
04:28:23,760 --> 04:28:24,520
What is this?

3817
04:28:24,959 --> 04:28:26,040
What the hell is this place?

3818
04:28:27,500 --> 04:28:28,860
Missouri. That's Missouri.

3819
04:29:08,149 --> 04:29:12,250
How do I make it to Europe?

3820
04:29:12,450 --> 04:29:14,940
OK, this is Neural Blender.

3821
04:29:15,139 --> 04:29:16,420
Jeremiah has a fun day at the beach.

3822
04:29:16,620 --> 04:29:17,819
He makes a sand castle.

3823
04:29:25,420 --> 04:29:26,020
How does this work?

3824
04:29:30,299 --> 04:29:36,399
In progress, Neural Blender can be safe, unsafe for work sometimes.

3825
04:29:36,600 --> 04:29:37,399
Oh, shit.

3826
04:29:37,440 --> 04:29:43,989
Well, let's go ahead and fucking make sure I don't show that.

3827
04:29:44,190 --> 04:29:45,989
That it takes a little bit to make it right.

3828
04:29:47,329 --> 04:29:48,170
How about this one?

3829
04:29:50,079 --> 04:29:53,139
What about the video game sound effects quiz?

3830
04:29:53,340 --> 04:29:54,340
See if I can get this right.

3831
04:30:00,420 --> 04:30:21,000
Go like this, make it a little bit bigger and get more.

3832
04:30:21,200 --> 04:30:23,639
OK, so I just input what I think it is.

3833
04:30:29,899 --> 04:30:37,670
OK, well, I'll try.

3834
04:30:37,870 --> 04:30:42,360
Number one is

3835
04:30:42,559 --> 04:30:43,479
that hurt my head.

3836
04:30:43,680 --> 04:30:49,409
But that is like Mario input answer like Mario Jump.

3837
04:30:56,309 --> 04:31:00,239
Does that have to be like Super Mario?

3838
04:31:00,440 --> 04:31:01,440
OK, good.

3839
04:31:06,170 --> 04:31:07,209
It's World of Warcraft.

3840
04:31:07,409 --> 04:31:09,170
That is the you completed a quest sound.

3841
04:31:13,510 --> 04:31:17,420
World of Warcraft.

3842
04:31:19,639 --> 04:31:21,360
Superhot.

3843
04:31:21,559 --> 04:31:27,250
That was pretty easy.

3844
04:31:29,450 --> 04:31:35,889
That's Half Life.

3845
04:31:36,090 --> 04:31:36,809
Thank you.

3846
04:31:37,010 --> 04:31:37,850
Resident Evil 4.

3847
04:31:38,049 --> 04:31:41,930
I only know that because I just I do that voice like every week.

3848
04:31:43,969 --> 04:31:46,079
Resident Evil 4.

3849
04:31:50,739 --> 04:31:52,020
What was that?

3850
04:31:56,370 --> 04:31:57,610
Put it in emote only mode.

3851
04:31:57,770 --> 04:31:59,530
Emote only, emote only, emote only.

3852
04:31:59,530 --> 04:32:00,209
I don't want to see it.

3853
04:32:09,479 --> 04:32:09,920
I don't know.

3854
04:32:11,129 --> 04:32:12,530
Die, monster.

3855
04:32:12,729 --> 04:32:15,319
You don't belong in this world.

3856
04:32:15,520 --> 04:32:16,680
What the hell is this?

3857
04:32:25,629 --> 04:32:26,430
I don't know.

3858
04:32:26,870 --> 04:32:28,629
Hail to the king, baby.

3859
04:32:28,829 --> 04:32:29,909
Duke Nukem.

3860
04:32:35,020 --> 04:32:36,100
It's not Duke Nukem.

3861
04:32:41,790 --> 04:32:42,629
Yes, it is.

3862
04:32:50,180 --> 04:32:51,260
Duke. What is it?

3863
04:32:51,459 --> 04:32:58,000
How do I spell it? Duke Nukem, Nukem, Nukem.

3864
04:32:58,200 --> 04:32:59,479
Am I spelling it wrong?

3865
04:33:00,500 --> 04:33:02,299
Hail to the king, baby.

3866
04:33:02,500 --> 04:33:03,540
It's Duke Nukem.

3867
04:33:11,849 --> 04:33:13,610
How do I spell this?

3868
04:33:18,659 --> 04:33:21,220
Is it not? It's not Duke Nukem.

3869
04:33:23,090 --> 04:33:24,490
Duke Nukem.

3870
04:33:26,720 --> 04:33:28,040
I don't know.

3871
04:33:30,979 --> 04:33:34,220
That's, um, what is this?

3872
04:33:36,580 --> 04:33:43,020
Tony Hawk. It's Tony Hawk.

3873
04:33:44,740 --> 04:33:46,740
That's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

3874
04:33:46,740 --> 04:33:47,220
What?

3875
04:33:48,689 --> 04:33:49,729
That's when you do like a trick.

3876
04:33:49,930 --> 04:33:52,009
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

3877
04:33:52,209 --> 04:33:56,529
Tony Hawk.

3878
04:33:56,729 --> 04:33:58,650
It has to be completely spelled accurately.

3879
04:33:58,849 --> 04:34:03,849
That's the Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.

3880
04:34:09,979 --> 04:34:14,720
Thank you.

3881
04:34:14,919 --> 04:34:24,069
Final Fantasy X. Dark Souls.

3882
04:34:24,639 --> 04:34:25,439
That's the new area.

3883
04:34:25,439 --> 04:34:30,180
You found a new area in Dark Souls where like you just you resurrected.

3884
04:34:31,330 --> 04:34:38,189
How do you find it? Come on.

3885
04:34:38,389 --> 04:34:42,310
Street Fighter 2.

3886
04:34:59,330 --> 04:35:00,490
What is that?

3887
04:35:00,689 --> 04:35:05,619
I know what it is, but I don't look at you, Hacker.

3888
04:35:05,819 --> 04:35:10,180
A pathetic creature of meat and bone.

3889
04:35:11,700 --> 04:35:12,979
System Shock 2.

3890
04:35:21,360 --> 04:35:24,639
My God, I hear what is this one?

3891
04:35:25,720 --> 04:35:28,599
This is a new day on a game.

3892
04:35:28,799 --> 04:35:30,200
This is a new day.

3893
04:35:31,860 --> 04:35:33,060
You started a new day.

3894
04:35:35,419 --> 04:35:37,819
But what game is this a new day of?

3895
04:35:45,639 --> 04:35:46,639
Yeah, I'll come back to it.

3896
04:35:49,000 --> 04:35:50,599
It's Mario Super.

3897
04:35:50,799 --> 04:35:51,599
Do I have to get the whole thing?

3898
04:35:52,360 --> 04:35:56,759
Super Mario World 2, Yoshi's Island.

3899
04:35:56,959 --> 04:35:57,599
Oh, I already got it.

3900
04:35:57,799 --> 04:36:03,930
OK, then, then, then, then, then, then.

3901
04:36:04,130 --> 04:36:05,450
Excite Excite a bike.

3902
04:36:08,130 --> 04:36:18,740
How do I say it? Excite a bike, excite bike, excite a bike, excite bike.

3903
04:36:20,330 --> 04:36:23,279
That's right, though, isn't it?

3904
04:36:26,819 --> 04:36:27,619
Excite bike.

3905
04:36:30,619 --> 04:36:31,500
I don't think I got it.

3906
04:36:31,580 --> 04:36:32,380
Maybe it's not right.

3907
04:36:34,040 --> 04:36:35,959
Sonic the Hedgehog rings been removed.

3908
04:36:36,119 --> 04:36:43,049
How come Sonic the Hedgehog doesn't need to be spelled out for the other ones to do?

3909
04:36:44,450 --> 04:36:55,509
Minecraft, Smash Brothers.

3910
04:36:55,709 --> 04:36:57,430
Oh, no, but they're not about to rob it.

3911
04:36:57,630 --> 04:37:00,830
It was a good idea to sell a whole lot of food.

3912
04:37:03,319 --> 04:37:04,439
Tear him up.

3913
04:37:04,639 --> 04:37:05,560
Oh, what a day.

3914
04:37:05,759 --> 04:37:09,319
I didn't mean to let it burn and tear it up.

3915
04:37:15,619 --> 04:37:17,180
Big Doug.

3916
04:37:17,880 --> 04:37:19,159
No,

3917
04:37:19,360 --> 04:37:21,200
Pac-Man, what am I talking about?

3918
04:37:21,400 --> 04:37:24,840
It's my favorite video game character ever.

3919
04:37:25,080 --> 04:37:32,439
I have no idea.

3920
04:37:33,069 --> 04:37:34,509
Mario Kart.

3921
04:37:36,680 --> 04:37:39,659
Mario Kart Wii.

3922
04:37:46,779 --> 04:37:49,229

3986
04:53:42,909 --> 04:53:44,509
it's not even like a sound effect from a game

3987
04:53:46,110 --> 04:53:58,159
animal crossing i feel like it might be animal crossing

3988
04:53:58,159 --> 04:54:10,590
I don't know.

3989
04:54:10,590 --> 04:54:13,430
This one, what is it?

3990
04:54:13,430 --> 04:54:19,860
It's like, it's that, it's something.

3991
04:54:19,860 --> 04:54:40,009
It goes like, whoa, whoa, right, oh my God, what is it?

3992
04:54:40,009 --> 04:54:42,970
Somebody over this sound makes like a high pitched sound effect.

3993
04:54:42,970 --> 04:55:00,119
It's like, whaaat?

3994
04:55:00,119 --> 04:55:06,619
It's something going, what is it though?

3995
04:55:06,619 --> 04:55:09,040
It's like a star or like a collectible and it blows up.

3996
04:55:09,040 --> 04:55:13,099
What is it?

3997
04:55:13,099 --> 04:55:20,419
It shows up on the screen, boom, you collected it.

3998
04:55:20,419 --> 04:55:37,349
Maybe this is Mario Odyssey, fuck do you spell Odyssey, Mario Galaxy, Mario Sunshine, Mario

3999
04:55:37,349 --> 04:55:52,880
60, no, Mario 64 goes da da da da, here we go.

4000
04:55:52,880 --> 04:55:57,069
Die monster, you don't belong in this world.

4001
04:56:00,000 --> 04:56:01,919
House of the Dead?

4002
04:56:01,919 --> 04:56:08,889
I feel like it could be House of the Dead, but it's not.

4003
04:56:08,889 --> 04:56:15,229
Die monster, you don't belong in this world.

4004
04:56:15,229 --> 04:56:17,830
Hail to the king, baby.

4005
04:56:17,830 --> 04:56:19,909
Doesn't make any sense that this is not Duke Nukem.

4006
04:56:19,909 --> 04:56:23,470
There's nobody else that is, that's Duke Nukem talking.

4007
04:56:23,470 --> 04:56:24,470
Shhh.

4008
04:56:24,470 --> 04:56:26,159
Jason!

4009
04:56:26,159 --> 04:56:27,979
Jason!

4010
04:56:27,979 --> 04:56:35,380
Sounds like a clip from a movie.

4011
04:56:35,380 --> 04:56:37,540
Let's put the cheese, hold on, what does it say?

4012
04:56:37,540 --> 04:56:38,540
What's the cheese?

4013
04:56:38,540 --> 04:56:45,740
Doritos chip, cheesy Doritos, Doritos, corn chip, chip.

4014
04:56:45,740 --> 04:56:47,779
Hail to the king, baby.

4015
04:56:47,779 --> 04:56:57,490
Cheesy chip, Duke Cheesem, Duke Cheesem, cheesy, Cheesem.

4016
04:56:57,490 --> 04:57:02,290
Duke Cheesem is I think like a McDonald's Play Plays character.

4017
04:57:02,290 --> 04:57:03,290
Cheez it?

4018
04:57:03,290 --> 04:57:07,319
I don't know, what are you trying to say?

4019
04:57:07,319 --> 04:57:14,340
Duke Cheez it, Duke, Duke Nukem?

4020
04:57:14,340 --> 04:57:17,819
I don't know what you're trying to convey to me, I don't know, I can't figure it out.

4021
04:57:17,819 --> 04:57:18,819
I have no idea.

4022
04:57:18,819 --> 04:57:24,330
I think I'm going to have to reveal.

4023
04:57:24,330 --> 04:57:28,169
This is like Galaga or, it's an old game, like an old Atari game.

4024
04:57:28,169 --> 04:57:36,439
It's like an old Atari game shooting sound.

4025
04:57:36,439 --> 04:57:43,790
Alright, alright, it's time to reveal.

4026
04:57:43,790 --> 04:57:44,790
It's time to reveal.

4027
04:57:44,790 --> 04:57:46,590
I don't think I can get any more.

4028
04:57:46,590 --> 04:57:58,619
Alright, here we go, I don't know, reveal.

4029
04:57:58,619 --> 04:58:00,860
Okay.

4030
04:58:00,860 --> 04:58:06,659
Enter the Gungeon, I would not have been able to get that shit.

4031
04:58:06,659 --> 04:58:09,099
The Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind, nope.

4032
04:58:09,099 --> 04:58:19,400
Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, I thought it was Silent Hill, I didn't put 3D in front

4033
04:58:19,400 --> 04:58:20,400
of it.

4034
04:58:20,400 --> 04:58:21,400
I thought I was losing my mind.

4035
04:58:21,400 --> 04:58:26,520
I was like, who else is this supposed to be?

4036
04:58:26,520 --> 04:58:30,000
Alien Isolation, eh, that's too specific, I don't think I would have got it.

4037
04:58:30,000 --> 04:58:42,930
Max Payne, oh, the slow mo dive, alright, uh, okay, what's Fortnite?

4038
04:58:42,930 --> 04:58:44,330
What did I say I thought this was?

4039
04:58:44,330 --> 04:58:47,209
So what's the Dorito, what's the Dorito shit?

4040
04:58:47,209 --> 04:58:55,909
Oh, 3D Doritos, okay, well thanks for the help.

4041
04:58:55,909 --> 04:58:59,069
Age of Empires 2, yeah.

4042
04:58:59,069 --> 04:59:07,659
Heavy Rain, Metroid, right, right, I knew it was an old game.

4043
04:59:07,659 --> 04:59:11,040
What is Luigi, which one is this one?

4044
04:59:11,040 --> 04:59:12,520
Didn't I write Luigi's Mansion?

4045
04:59:12,520 --> 04:59:23,290
Wait, that's not Waluigi, I thought that was Waluigi winning a game of Mario Tennis.

4046
04:59:23,290 --> 04:59:28,380
Where did I write Luigi's Mansion?

4047
04:59:28,380 --> 04:59:32,099
I wrote Luigi's Mansion for one of these and I got it wrong.

4048
04:59:32,459 --> 04:59:43,290
Oh, that's when you activate the VATS, right, I had played no Rocket League ever, so what's

4049
04:59:43,290 --> 04:59:47,040
this one, Silent Hill 2?

4050
04:59:47,040 --> 05:00:05,020
You're in the menu, Halo, I thought this was like Bowser, Quake, no, Oddworld, right, when

4051
05:00:05,020 --> 05:00:15,110
you can kind of communicate, I forgot, I want to see 7, oh, it's a Chocobo, Puppet, Puppet,

4052
05:00:16,419 --> 05:00:26,110

4053
05:00:26,110 --> 05:00:41,200
noise, playing it, when I streamed it, I just fucking screamed and made weird sounds whenever

4054
05:00:41,200 --> 05:00:58,419
I would die, so stupid, I would not have gotten that, that was cool, I liked that, that was

4055
05:00:58,419 --> 05:01:04,990
fun, that was fun, okay, oh, I need to check on this neural network thing, make sure it's

4057
05:01:23,220 --> 05:01:30,500

4058
05:01:30,500 --> 05:01:39,299
be like a dick, I don't, is this like a dick, okay, it might be, I don't know, I don't know,

4059
05:01:39,299 --> 05:01:51,529
I'm going to clip, I'm going to, hold on, let me make sure I can clip, cut this out,

4060
05:01:51,529 --> 05:01:55,130
I don't know what that's supposed to be, but it's hard to tell, but this image is so funny

4061
05:01:59,810 --> 05:02:14,290
hold on, let me like, I gotta zoom in, I'll cut the bottom part off, give me a sec, how

4077
05:05:41,840 --> 05:05:49,090
flying high over the map in the bus, do you leap up because I have no fear, just wait a bit longer

4078
05:05:49,090 --> 05:05:59,189
there's no rush, stay in the battle bus as I have snacks, or, I don't know, what would you do, I'm

4079
05:05:59,189 --> 05:06:05,139
gonna say, I don't know, what would you do, is this DMCA, what, it would be, I don't know,

likely to listen to, any heavy metal band, dance, classical, or pop, out of everything on this list

4087
05:07:08,139 --> 05:07:17,740
probably pop, or is it I'm reverse aging, what, you're playing Fortnite and your teammate comes

4088
05:07:17,740 --> 05:07:23,659
under attack, okay, do everything you can to help your teammate, get into a flap, I don't know,

4089
05:07:23,659 --> 05:07:27,500
that's lingo for something, I don't know what that means, um, distract your enemies by pretending

4090
05:07:27,500 --> 05:07:39,000
to be a big jelly baby, I would help my teammate, which pet would you most like to have, a crow,

anything but a chimpanzee, let's go with a cat, why is it a big chicken, an old dog with a kind

4092
05:07:45,720 --> 05:07:55,110
face, what would you most like to eat, I have no time to eat on the battlefield, but might have

4093
05:07:55,110 --> 05:08:02,200
some crisps, this person is English, a slice of cake, vegetable fingers, and some baked beans,

4094
05:08:02,200 --> 05:08:08,200
I'd love a burger right now, yeah, I thought underneath this was an ad for like dental implants,

4095
05:08:08,840 --> 05:08:16,779
you would get those, I honestly thought this was what this was, I'd like a burger actually,

4096
05:08:17,340 --> 05:08:23,720
which item of clothing do you prefer to wear, a black hoodie or something, a suit and bow tie,

4097
05:08:23,720 --> 05:08:31,259
a cape, um, probably different hats, yeah, all right, finally, you're trapped under this desert

4098
05:08:31,259 --> 05:08:42,860
island, what one item would you take with you, a helicopter, yes, your, is your ripply, we're not

4099
05:08:42,860 --> 05:08:55,159
sure why, but when we see this Fortnite scheme, we want a bowl of jelly or something, that was

4100
05:08:56,599 --> 05:09:08,069
very cute, all right, let me just check on the neural network thing, it's still in progress,

4101
05:09:08,069 --> 05:09:15,880
it's taking a while, it's trying to figure out what to do, and I'm gonna do the thing I do every

4102
05:09:15,880 --> 05:09:19,959
time I do this, I hopefully doesn't take this, it takes between 10 minutes and 15 minutes,

4103
05:09:20,599 --> 05:09:25,240
we're just, we're just gonna do another fucking IQ test, like I mean, I'm gonna do this, I'm not

4104
05:09:25,240 --> 05:09:30,860
really ready, I haven't like eaten any protein today or anything, so I'm telling you right now,

4105
05:09:30,860 --> 05:09:35,259
this is probably gonna be very inaccurate, we take an IQ test every time, just to make sure that I'm

4106
05:09:35,259 --> 05:09:42,860
still above at least like 60 IQ, who knows, here we go again, begin assessment, the section you will

4107
05:09:42,860 --> 05:09:47,720
be given a word, and I don't want to listen to this music, it's fucking distracting me, in this

4108
05:09:47,720 --> 05:09:51,639
section, you'll be given a word and asked to select from a list of other words, which mean the same

4109
05:09:51,639 --> 05:09:55,880
thing, it'll be 10 answers for each question, and three to five of the answers to each question

4110
05:09:55,880 --> 05:10:02,520
will be correct, you get, so no more than five, you get plus one point for each correct choice you

4111
05:10:02,520 --> 05:10:06,840
make, and minus one point for each wrong choice, so select as many as you know, but don't guess,

4112
05:10:07,560 --> 05:10:16,330
go, all the words with a similar meaning as the one above, big, mammoth, large, huge, colossal,

4113
05:10:16,970 --> 05:10:41,959
I don't think this is a word, hippopotamon, small, yeah, done, lame, charge, cues, incopulate,

4114
05:10:44,119 --> 05:11:02,020
oil, borebear, borbear, harassed, indict, pulled, chilly, nippy, freezing, boreal, it's boreal,

4115
05:11:02,020 --> 05:11:12,840
it's boreal in here, it's boreal, it's boreal, boreal, boreal, it's so boreal in here, stop,

4116
05:11:12,840 --> 05:11:38,919
halt, end, terminate, degroute, vestige, reprobate, that's like a legal term, I think, maybe, short,

4117
05:11:38,919 --> 05:11:58,099
brief, fleeting, it's only three to five, okay, beginner, a beginner, a newcomer, a novice,

4118
05:11:58,659 --> 05:12:18,680
a rookie, a neophyte, greenhorn, I don't know, well greenhorn is, I don't know, thin, thin, thin,

4119
05:12:19,560 --> 05:12:32,729
sheer, skinny, no, sheered means see-through, skinny, narrow, um, lupay, anem, anemechel,

4120
05:12:34,020 --> 05:12:39,139
smiggly, there's another one at least, I don't know, these are all these words, nobody even uses

4121
05:12:39,139 --> 05:12:45,659
these, I don't go to Starbucks and go, oh yes, could I have a, uh, a, uh, anemechel coffee,

4122
05:12:45,659 --> 05:12:53,560
please, nobody uses these words in real life, I don't care how high, how smart you are, chat

4123
05:12:53,560 --> 05:12:58,810
can't even do this in their head, mental rotation subtest, in this section you'll be given an example

4124
05:12:58,810 --> 05:13:04,939
shape and asked to select from a list of other shapes which ones are the same, okay, so it has

4125
05:13:04,939 --> 05:13:09,580
to be the same image, for example, the two shapes below are the same just viewed from a different

4126
05:13:09,580 --> 05:13:15,580
direction, but the next two shapes are actually different, see the animation that shows they are

4127
05:13:15,580 --> 05:13:31,750
mirror images, so I have to pick the things that are the same image, which of these shapes are the

4128
05:13:31,750 --> 05:14:00,020
same, oh god, I'm gonna get an F, relax, not this one, this is not the same, this one, this one,

4129
05:14:00,020 --> 05:14:47,180
this one, I can see you guys talking, I don't want to see it, emote only right now, I, I can,

4130
05:14:47,180 --> 05:15:40,119
I can sense them making fun of me, this one, this doesn't tell you anything by the way, like, oh,

4131
05:15:40,119 --> 05:15:45,939
can you like go like this with a shape or what side is it on, no, I want practical fucking shit,

4132
05:15:45,939 --> 05:15:51,049
you know what I mean, I'm practically intelligent, I'm not on paper intelligent, I'm practically

4133
05:15:51,049 --> 05:16:01,500
intelligent, where do you use this, all right, I can, god, find me a situation where you can like

4134
05:16:01,500 --> 05:16:08,869
get yourself out of trouble with this one, yeah, how do you, how do you solve a problem with this one,

4135
05:16:09,509 --> 05:16:20,389
it's not, okay, it's not this one, it isn't, not this one,

4136
05:16:21,110 --> 05:16:28,900
not this one, wait, maybe it is this one, it is this one, this is going the wrong direction,

4137
05:16:28,900 --> 05:17:05,979
nope, it's this one, do I spin this, it's this one, spin it, this is wrong, flat, flat, this way,

4138
05:17:06,779 --> 05:17:38,500
stop it, one goes wing, wing, wing, goes wing, wing, wing, goes ee, oo, mm, wow, wrong, this one goes

4139
05:17:39,299 --> 05:17:52,310
ee, oo, mm, this one, not this one, this is incorrect, it's going the wrong way, if I take this

4140
05:17:52,869 --> 05:18:06,340
and I turn it, it would be going, this is correct, if I put it flat and turn it, this is wrong,

4141
05:18:07,220 --> 05:18:16,599
this is cringe, all right, you know what, if I, if you had 10, what, 50, 500,000 people breathing

4142
05:18:16,599 --> 05:18:19,240
down your neck while you take an IQ test, you don't think you'd have a little bit of trouble,

4143
05:18:20,200 --> 05:18:23,560
there's like 500,000 people breathing down my neck right now,

4144
05:18:24,119 --> 05:18:32,389
I, I can't, get away from me, let's relax and go for it, this is going this way, this one's wrong

4145
05:18:32,389 --> 05:18:40,229
in the lower left, I believe this one's accurate, if I flip it up, I mean this way, that way,

4146
05:18:40,869 --> 05:18:47,659
and if I turn it, this one's correct, this one might be correct, hold on, if I take it like this,

4147
05:18:49,610 --> 05:18:58,759
flip it, no, if I flip it this way, no, it's wrong, if I stand this one up, turn it, this one's

4148
05:18:58,759 --> 05:19:12,650
correct, yikes, what is playing right now, oh my god, this is like Fortnite music,

4149
05:19:13,369 --> 05:19:22,459
what do you mean, no, whatever, you take it, okay, I, can I just skip this one and just get enough,

4150
05:19:22,459 --> 05:19:35,290
this one, oh yeah, it goes down, it goes right down, left down, right down, left down,

4151
05:19:36,090 --> 05:19:42,680
so if I take this one and I flip it up, go right down, left down, holy shit, this is hard,

4152
05:19:43,240 --> 05:20:03,830
I turn this one, this is correct, put this up and turn it, it goes that way, down, right, down,

4153
05:20:03,830 --> 05:20:11,689
this is not correct, I take this one and I flip it, oh yeah, this is fucking hard, this is really

4154
05:20:11,689 --> 05:20:24,810
hard, if I turn this one that way, it goes wham, yeah, it's this one, all right, I'm done,

4155
05:20:25,529 --> 05:20:32,259
visual memory subtest, you'll be shown a grid with some cells shaded for five seconds, then you'll

4156
05:20:32,259 --> 05:20:37,540
have to reproduce that sample pattern from memory as best as you can, okay, so just fill in the

4157
05:20:37,540 --> 05:21:42,549
fill in the shades, memorize the arrangement, got it, fuck, where was this one, I don't remember,

4158
05:22:02,279 --> 05:22:09,860
nailed it, in this section you'll be, you will be a list, you'll see a list of scrambled letters

4159
05:22:10,419 --> 05:22:15,509
and asked to find as many as you can that can be unscrambled into real English words,

4160
05:22:16,069 --> 05:22:21,400
oh shit, okay, I have to unscrew them, I'm so bad at these ones, I'm so bad at this,

4161
05:22:22,119 --> 05:22:30,740
like as many, wait, hold on, like as many as possible that can be unscrambled into an English

4162
05:22:30,740 --> 05:23:32,709
word, okay, I think that's it, okay, okay,

4163
05:23:37,479 --> 05:23:51,880
that felt, fade, toughed, puffed, come back to it, easy, we, we, at,

4164
05:23:55,159 --> 05:24:07,479
Aaron, stop, stop, it's a test, I fucked it up, that, I've screwed it up, I can't concentrate

4165
05:24:07,479 --> 05:24:38,220
anymore, save, disc, rain, pale, Borg, no, that's a Star Trek word, it's not real, eight, okay,

4166
05:24:38,220 --> 05:25:10,979
algae, gal, plane, nail, salt, slate, shpey, peth, peths, hep, sin,

4167
05:25:14,790 --> 05:25:34,090
tassin, ten, waste, laro, I'm so bad at these, edard, tardy, trade, dry, I can't, it's just,

4168
05:25:34,090 --> 05:25:40,700
I can't do it, my brain can't do it, I can't do these, I'm so fucking bad at these, oh no,

4169
05:25:41,340 --> 05:25:46,860
this doesn't even mean anything, I bet you I can fucking destroy you in arm wrestling, okay,

4170
05:25:46,860 --> 05:25:51,830
it's an old joke, all right, in this task you'll be given a grid with some points shaded in green,

4171
05:25:52,549 --> 05:26:04,259
you will need to select the point that is most in the middle of all of them, the one that has

4172
05:26:04,259 --> 05:26:09,139
the lowest average distance from it to each of the green points, for example, in the grid below,

4173
05:26:09,139 --> 05:26:15,220
what point is closest to all the green, all three green points at the same time, it would be like

4174
05:26:16,119 --> 05:26:28,150
one, two, three, one, two, three, it's something like here maybe, here, here, two possible answers

4175
05:26:28,150 --> 05:26:36,700
are below, blue lines have been added to show how good each is, so it has to be like an equal

4176
05:26:36,700 --> 05:26:40,700
distance away from everything, like do I have that correct, did I get that right, how does it

4177
05:26:40,700 --> 05:26:48,340
get resident sleeper, sorry man, whatever am I, so it has to be like an equal distance away from

4178
05:26:48,340 --> 05:26:54,740
all of them, all right, let's just go for it, no, I got that wrong, what do you mean, it was the most

4179
05:26:54,740 --> 05:27:07,189
in the middle of all of them, oh, I see, okay, this one, oh, I thought I got it wrong, I was like what

4180
05:27:07,189 --> 05:27:33,000
the fuck, okay, what, point closest to all the points, it would have to be like up, what, oh no,

4181
05:27:39,319 --> 05:27:49,110
I don't know, I can't get this open, I can't physically open this, oh, it's because I have

4182
05:27:49,110 --> 05:27:57,830
to take the seal off, the point closest to all the green points, it just has to be one of these,

4183
05:27:57,830 --> 05:28:05,259
right, it doesn't matter which one, oh, that is a trick question, okay, closest to all the green

4184
05:28:05,259 --> 05:28:32,540
points would be like here, what, this is the point in the middle, maybe like this one, I don't know,

4185
05:28:32,540 --> 05:28:39,189
I thought, I'm thinking like, I don't know why I thought that, I'm thinking like they all like

4186
05:28:39,189 --> 05:28:48,819
meet at this point, I'm getting it wrong, Jesus Christ, it's the middle, the middle most point,

4187
05:28:50,220 --> 05:28:57,900
okay, it's definitely like here, or here, here, here, what the fuck are you talking about,

4188
05:28:59,099 --> 05:29:14,150
what, because this has to travel, this has to travel, this has to travel, this shit, who fucking

4189
05:29:14,150 --> 05:29:36,569
cares about this, here, oh, come on, that's close, the middle most point from here, this has to be

4190
05:29:36,569 --> 05:29:45,529
like here, or here, right, I don't get it, I was just the middle most point, what, I don't get it,

4191
05:29:45,529 --> 05:30:03,220
I don't understand how that's the middle most point, closest to all of them, holy shit, I'm gonna,

4192
05:30:03,220 --> 05:30:08,540
I'm gonna, they're gonna ask me if I'm, if I'm alive, I'm gonna get a thing at the end, this is

4193
05:30:08,540 --> 05:30:11,580
gonna say, hey, please, that's like funny, but like no like dead people can take this test,

4194
05:30:12,299 --> 05:30:27,979
I've been just putting this on, it's all over my mouth, that was close,

4195
05:30:28,619 --> 05:30:35,500
all right, it's definitely, it has to be like up here somewhere, like here, something stupid,

4196
05:30:36,220 --> 05:30:45,939
that was also close, the difficult ones of getting better, I almost nailed it, I'm getting better,

4197
05:30:46,659 --> 05:31:02,020
this is probably right in the middle, getting better, right here, I'm like within one or two

4198
05:31:02,020 --> 05:31:09,290
spots each time, so I'm not, I'm not upset about this, this one could be anywhere, do I have

4199
05:31:09,290 --> 05:31:26,099
Fortnite music on, let me get this shit off, I'm also listening to like Fortnite music, like you

4200
05:31:26,099 --> 05:31:55,180
don't think that's messing with my head doing the IQ test, there you go, okay, close, oh, I did,

4201
05:31:55,180 --> 05:32:01,060
wait, did it kick me off, did I fail, that was only like 16, I was getting too many wrong,

4202
05:32:01,060 --> 05:32:06,220
I got slaughter ruled, in this up test, you'll be shown a sequence of icons one at a time,

4203
05:32:06,939 --> 05:32:11,340
then you'll be shown eight icons and asked which were in the sequence you just saw,

4204
05:32:13,259 --> 05:32:39,419
so I'm gonna be shown icons, and I have to say which ones were in which order, okay, I fucked it

4205
05:32:39,419 --> 05:32:44,540
up, I just, I started listening to, I started doing valley music, I was just like, oh, start a

4206
05:32:44,540 --> 05:33:09,159
valley, it's really cool, and it was gone, one of them's not on here, wait, hold on a second,

4207
05:33:09,159 --> 05:33:13,159
wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, it's not showing, I'm not clicking them in sequence,

4208
05:33:13,720 --> 05:33:27,930
I have, oh, I, well now I have no fucking idea, I did not understand the instructions,

4209
05:33:27,930 --> 05:33:50,549
god, I don't know, I think this, I don't know, now I get it, it's just, it's too hard to,

4210
05:33:50,549 --> 05:34:27,610
it's too hard to remember these, especially, no, they put a check on it, they, they're fucking with

4211
05:34:27,610 --> 05:34:37,159
me, man, I mean, this was the first one, this one, no, this is, is this one, this one, this one,

4212
05:34:37,159 --> 05:35:08,490
this one, oh, I did it, you want to answer some research questions, no, I, okay, what is it,

4213
05:35:12,259 --> 05:35:28,810
get out of here, 117, oh, I don't, I don't know where I am, but, oh, I thought it was gonna be like

4214
05:35:28,810 --> 05:35:41,049
85, okay, 117, it's gone down, I want to make that clear, I've taken, I've taken an IQ test

4215
05:35:41,049 --> 05:35:47,459
before, a real one, twice, the first time I took it, and by the way, IQ test takes usually like a

4216
05:35:47,459 --> 05:35:55,259
couple of hours, like it takes like an hour plus, I, when I first took an IQ test when I was like

4217
05:35:55,259 --> 05:36:04,900
17 or so, I had 126, and then it went down to like 124, and now it's 117, I took 100, it was 124 in

4218
05:36:04,900 --> 05:36:11,909
college, and now it's apparently 117, it's probably lower than this, it's probably like, it's probably

4219
05:36:11,909 --> 05:36:22,700
like 110, probably for real, 99, look at my memory, I got, I'm doing fine, once, look at this,

4220
05:36:22,700 --> 05:36:34,180
come on, look at the, look where I am, this is where I sit, this isn't a real test, are you sure,

4221
05:36:34,180 --> 05:36:38,500
I, I thought a psychologist was giving this to me, are you sure I, we can't use this in court or

4222
05:36:38,500 --> 05:36:59,909
whatever, oh, IQ test of bullshit anyways, what if, imagine if I got like fucking, like 140, there,

4223
05:37:00,549 --> 05:37:09,529
print screen, well, this explains why I have a lot of trouble like walking around a concrete building

4224
05:37:09,529 --> 05:37:22,520
in Hitman, I do have a pretty good memory, pretty good, not great, pretty good, all right, what the

4225
05:37:22,520 --> 05:37:28,409
hell, oh wait, the neural network thing, make sure it's not, somebody's ball sack or something,

4226
05:37:28,409 --> 05:37:51,770
let's find out, I can't, it's hard to tell what this is, it's so hard to tell if this is like,

4227
05:37:51,770 --> 05:38:04,009
like an asshole or something, because I don't know, it could be, let me just make sure it's not,

4228
05:38:04,569 --> 05:38:24,099
hold on, yeah, I don't know, I can't tell, this is like a pair, I think it's like a pair of legs

4229
05:38:24,099 --> 05:38:27,979
on the left and it's like somebody's asshole, like going up to their asshole or something,

4230
05:38:27,979 --> 05:38:50,490
I'm not sure on it, this is, Jerma enjoys his favorite cheeseburger restaurant, what's the

4231
05:38:50,490 --> 05:39:00,740
website, it's a neuralblender.com apparently, I'll try another one, what should I do, let's see,

4232
05:39:00,740 --> 05:39:33,159
I have no idea what's gonna happen with this one, we'll see, all right, what time is it,

4233
05:39:33,159 --> 05:39:39,450
we could maybe time for a little bit more, what is this one, oh people, people want me to play this,

4234
05:39:40,090 --> 05:40:01,020
this is called Monster Breeder, is this game fun, this might take a full stream, it's really fun,

4235
05:40:01,659 --> 05:40:23,400
you think so, I do music, what's, somebody just said, what's this shitty music, I'm sorry, I got

4236
05:40:23,400 --> 05:40:27,639
my, I just had a gastric upset there, I got my, I had an epigastric reflux there for a second,

4237
05:40:27,639 --> 05:40:44,790
what did you say, did you say, you said Stardew Valley's music is bad, come on man, come on,

4238
05:40:44,790 --> 05:40:52,630
um, I'll check this out for a little bit, I've been really streaming for six hours, what the

4239
05:40:52,630 --> 05:41:08,069
hell happened, all right, music, why not, I'll give it a try, you spent two hours on fast food,

4240
05:41:15,979 --> 05:41:19,740
visit, okay, you are at your ranch, from here you can visit your monsters in the stables,

4241
05:41:19,740 --> 05:41:26,330
browse the breeder catalog, or get in your truck and go exploring, um, go exploring,

4242
05:41:28,020 --> 05:41:33,860
exploring local hot spots is a great way to find and capture wild monsters, you load up your gear

4243
05:41:33,860 --> 05:41:39,459
into your truck, to the north of the woods and to the east of the city, to the south of the desert,

4244
05:41:39,459 --> 05:41:46,500
let's go to the woods, there's a narrow path leading in, to the west is a castle or to the ranch,

4245
05:41:48,650 --> 05:41:54,060
let's go to the castle, drive toward the ancient stone castle, its shape seems to blacken

4246
05:41:54,139 --> 05:42:13,849
as a thunderstorm gathers overhead, to the east are the woods, next game, you leave your trunk,

4247
05:42:14,409 --> 05:42:18,490
you leave your truck in front and step toward the castle, bringing along your monster catching gear,

4248
05:42:20,869 --> 05:42:28,470
oh shit, passing through the castle stone entrance way, dusty room, the walls are decorated

4249
05:42:28,470 --> 05:42:42,139
by gray distorted paintings, stop, residents sleep ring me, you're in dusty sitting room,

4250
05:42:42,139 --> 05:42:51,860
the walls are decorated by, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's keep going, that's all I can do, oh no,

4251
05:42:51,860 --> 05:42:56,180
you're in a library, the books are packed into shelves, two stories high, occasionally a book

4252
05:42:56,180 --> 05:43:16,630
seems to move, should I like mark it, oh pull the book, you pull the book, the bookshelf slides open

4253
05:43:16,630 --> 05:43:26,360
revealing a secret passageway, that's actually kind of cool, large spiral staircase, you're in

4254
05:43:26,360 --> 05:43:37,880
a dungeon, there are large broken shackles on the wall, you hear boots stomping heavily, you turn

4255
05:43:37,880 --> 05:43:47,669
around, crikey, it's frankenstein, capture frankenstein, what, you easily bag frankenstein,

4256
05:43:47,669 --> 05:44:01,930
put frankenstein in the truck, this is kind of cool, this is cool, should I do this for a

4257
05:44:01,930 --> 05:44:16,490
whole stream, yeah, this is a whole stream, I can't, I kind of, I'm very interested in this,

4258
05:44:16,490 --> 05:44:27,880
yes, yes, honestly, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do this again, I'm gonna do this the whole time though,

4259
05:44:27,880 --> 05:44:34,139
breed frankenstein, let me get at least one more, oh gargoyle appears, capture the gargoyle,

4260
05:44:34,139 --> 05:44:50,419
oh you need special aerial monster catching gear, how many more, okay, this is gonna determine how

4261
05:44:50,419 --> 05:44:56,659
much I like this, and if I really actually want to play this, how many monsters are in the game,

4262
05:44:56,659 --> 05:45:19,240
just tell me, there's 120, there are 500, there's so many, there's hundreds, okay, this is actually,

4263
05:45:19,240 --> 05:45:25,180
this is a ghost appears, capture the ghost, okay, I got him, ghost in the truck, go back to the

4264
05:45:25,180 --> 05:45:34,419
ranch, all right, go to the monster staples, frankenstein, breed frankenstein with ghost,

4265
05:45:34,419 --> 05:45:40,279
it looks like frankenstein and ghost are mating, they're done, congratulations, you have a bald

4266
05:45:40,279 --> 05:46:01,610
frankenstein, frankengeist, talk, boo boo, not frankenstein, boo boo, monster, boo, so wait,

4267
05:46:01,610 --> 05:46:13,369
could I do frankengeist, oh you can't do it, I was gonna, why would I, no, that would be weird,

4268
05:46:17,159 --> 05:46:36,759
I don't know what I was just saying, I don't know what I was just saying, I'm sorry, your

4269
05:46:36,759 --> 05:46:42,139
telephone is ringing, answer the phone, hello, hello, hello, don't do it, I'm, people are gonna

4270
05:46:42,139 --> 05:46:47,060
hate me, I can't do it every time somebody says hello on camera, I'm hearing that you're breeding

4271
05:46:47,060 --> 05:46:52,659
some groundbreaking new monster crosses, would you be interested in selling, are you a cop,

4272
05:46:52,659 --> 05:46:58,900
no way, yes, I'm selling, wonderful, can you sell me a monster like this, slow moving,

4273
05:46:59,459 --> 05:47:06,619
clothed, transparent, and magical, I got a frankengeist for you, frankengeist sounds great,

4274
05:47:06,619 --> 05:47:18,549
200, 200 bucks, do the staples, do the catalog, this is, yeah, we're doing this, but not now,

4275
05:47:18,549 --> 05:47:22,250
I'm probably gonna wrap up in a minute, how long have I been live for,

4276
05:47:23,529 --> 05:48:15,590
I'll be back on Sunday, oh well let me check on the art thing, this one sucks, where's god,

4277
05:48:15,590 --> 05:48:37,380
Jerma is the one weekend a month dad everyone wants to hang out with, all right, I'm probably

4278
05:48:37,380 --> 05:48:41,880
gonna wrap it up, wait, I need to get to exactly six hours, how long do I have to do for that,

4279
05:48:41,880 --> 05:48:45,880
how much time, how much time, I haven't looked at my dashboard the whole stream,
