1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,730
Okay, let's play, uh, I have a controller, period.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,609
20 minutes till dawn. If you've never played this before, if you like vampire survivors, this game is...

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,689
No, no, no controller, no controller, that's right.

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:20,300
This game is kind of like vampire survivors. It's very fun.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,219
Are any mods around to change the game to, um, 20 minutes till dawn?

6
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:35,780
Are you gonna play VR?

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,299
No, not for a while.

8
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,899
Capture it or what?

9
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:58,179
There you go.

10
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:14,540
Okay, so 20 minutes till dawn is a game where you play as a, uh,

11
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,540
you're in the middle and you walk around and you shoot stuff.

12
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,840
It's really good, it's really fun.

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,269
We'll give this, like, half an hour.

14
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:29,530
Can you show the game list again?

15
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,230
Um, I don't have a way to do that.

16
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,989
All right, so I want to play with, uh, what's a good thing to play with?

17
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:37,030
I unlocked a few things.

18
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,180
What should I do?

19
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,549
Do 20 minutes.

20
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,120
Maybe 20, 25, 30, maybe 40, maybe an hour.

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,719
All right, can reroll upgrades?

22
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,319
Uh, it starts with very high HP.

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,750
Play it for 20 minutes.

24
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,069
We'll see.

25
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,390
All right, your bullets have...

26
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,390
All right, um...

27
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,689
What should I do for a weapon?

28
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:02,329
Bat gun?

29
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,010
Shoot bats that chase down enemies.

30
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,530
Bats are both bullets and summons.

31
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,810
Sure, I'll try it.

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,530
With, uh, you.

33
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,729
What about my runes?

34
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:22,150
Sounds good to me.

35
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:28,780
All right, let's play.

36
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,900
Standard mode.

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,810
Oh, should I activate this?

38
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,530
Small enemies spawn more often and small enemies have more HP.

39
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,050
I feel like that's kind of going to be hard.

40
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,740
I'm going for it.

41
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,240
Fuck it.

42
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,030
It's kind of loud.

43
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,639
Let me help you there.

44
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,159
This game is sick, by the way.

45
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:59,620
Is there a dodge roll?

46
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,289
I forgot.

47
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,250
No, there isn't.

48
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,289
No, no, no, there's not.

49
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:17,099
All right, the bat is pretty fun.

50
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:25,300
20 minutes of this?

51
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,699
Maybe?

52
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:26,099
I don't know.

53
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,819
Hey, guys, this is Omega Gaming Weekend.

54
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:35,819
I did not title this stream the next few days.

55
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,740
That's not what the title says.

56
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,229
That's not what it says on the title.

57
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,590
Definitely projectiles.

58
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,110
100% projectiles.

59
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,710
This is going to be three, right?

60
00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:09,580
Oh, are you going to bet on this one?

61
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,699
Actually, don't bet on this one.

62
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,220
All right, these are summons.

63
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,819
Additional bullet.

64
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,959
After shooting your last ammo, smite nearby enemies.

65
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,600
That's pretty good.

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
Bullet damage.

67
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,959
That's pretty good.

68
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,160
That's really good.

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,509
Ghost friend is really good.

70
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:32,889
Summoning bullets.

71
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,660
I think I'm going to do this.

72
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,860
Stop reloading.

73
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,160
I have auto reload.

74
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:47,290
I have auto reload turned on.

75
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,209
Reload can be canceled in the middle of a reload.

76
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:51,220
So I'm going to keep it on.

77
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,180
That's actually really helpful.

78
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,839
This is good so far.

79
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,259
So far, so good.

80
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:03,060
Maybe?

81
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,699
No.

82
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,139
Plus one projectile.

83
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,180
Spread.

84
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,980
Don't really care.

85
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,019
Doubles base projectile.

86
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:09,220
Whoa, yeah.

87
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,509
I really hope that whoever is betting right now,

88
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:22,870
you're betting on the right thing.

89
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,269
Because it's not possible to lose now.

90
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:51,529
It's not possible for me to lose.

91
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:52,089
I'll be fine.

92
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:52,889
Don't worry.

93
00:05:52,889 --> 00:06:07,500
All right, I need something big here.

94
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,680
Burn for three seconds.

95
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,720
Reload rate.

96
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,459
Huge.

97
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:18,579
Shield is huge.

98
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:23,850
Bullets can do curse.

99
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,569
That's pretty good.

100
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,629
It's probably burn.

101
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,949
But it also might be reload rate.

102
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:31,670
Could be.

103
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,139
I'll do burn.

104
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:50,069
It's bouncing around a lot.

105
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:51,110
Magic lens.

106
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,670
Nah.

107
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,139
That one's not bad.

108
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,060
Every second shot, lightning strikes.

109
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,370
When shooting your last ammo,

110
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,050
10 bullets go in a circle.

111
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,860
Pretty big.

112
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,060
Freeze is big.

113
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,139
What do you think?

114
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,180
Freeze or lightning?

115
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,779
What do you guys think?

116
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,819
Burn, resident sleeper, curse, thumbs up.

117
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:22,379
Lightning, you think so?

118
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:52,709
All right, I gotta stop being an idiot.

119
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,990
All right, stop being an idiot.

120
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,759
Speed.

121
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,120
Pickup range is big.

122
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,660
I need movement speed.

123
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,810
It's impossible to lose.

124
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,970
Well, it's impossible to lose unless I walk into stuff.

125
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,610
What just happened?

126
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:11,350
Oh, I selected it.

127
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,709
All right, yeah, I want movement speed.

128
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:13,589
So important.

129
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:28,220
Do I get the health now or that?

130
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,139
Probably that.

131
00:08:32,139 --> 00:09:02,500
Yeah.

132
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,019
Yikes.

133
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,659
Did I get hit?

134
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,220
No, I didn't.

135
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,100
I almost did though.

136
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,429
All right, summon an egg that will hatch

137
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:13,909
to a dragon in three minutes.

138
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:16,340
Reload rate, 20%.

139
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,059
Summon a ghost friend that shoots piercing bullets.

140
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,259
Bullet speed plus 30%.

141
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,379
Max HP.

142
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:36,299
I need damage.

143
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,179
I'm falling off.

144
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:45,159
I'm falling off.

145
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,360
I need damage so bad.

146
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:55,480
Summon a magic dagger that seeks out nearby enemies.

147
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,360
That's not bad.

148
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,559
Probably this though.

149
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,299
Every fifth shot, launch a fireball or super speed.

150
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,710
Every fifth shot, launch a fireball.

151
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,549
I think that's the one.

152
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:07,860
I need damage.

153
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,940
Give me something good.

154
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,659
Increase fire rate and reload rate by plus 10%

155
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,259
permanently every time you get hit.

156
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,200
That's good.

157
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't want to get hit, but I have to.

158
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,840
I will.

159
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:41,220
Yeah, I'll be honest.

160
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,539
It's kind of hard to tell if the bats are enemies sometimes.

161
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,269
Does that count?

162
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:58,659
No, it's probably cursed, right?

163
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,259
Got to take the L.

164
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:03,350
Yeah, it's cursed.

165
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,120
We got all kinds of variety on a mega gaming weekend.

166
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:33,370
This is a nice break.

167
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:41,220
All right.

168
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,299
This is where I could lose everything right here.

169
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:53,620
It's definitely this one.

170
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,100
Power shot instead.

171
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,899
Bullet damage plus, yeah, fine.

172
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:00,379
I'll do it.

173
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:00,860
You're right.

174
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,460
You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

175
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:13,669
Stupid, stupid.

176
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:21,669
It's over, it's over, it's over.

177
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,440
Oh my God.

178
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,659
This thing takes so much damage.

179
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:35,220
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,539
I'm sorry to everybody that voted for me.

181
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:42,700
I could pull it back though.

182
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,899
I could pull it back.

183
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:48,460
I can pull it back.

184
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,019
I can.

185
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,259
You don't understand right angles.

186
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:59,860
One of the mods is saying, hey, is Disney Infinity 3.0

187
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,980
actually on the list?

188
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,740
Yeah, that's a good question.

189
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:13,539
It is on the list and it's next.

190
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:19,049
Wait, these count as summons.

191
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,490
These count as summons, right?

192
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,049
I'm doing it.

193
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:21,769
Who cares?

194
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:27,610
That'll kill me, won't it?

195
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:34,360
That reload rate debuff is so bad.

196
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:41,750
This is probably the safe one.

197
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:58,940
I think I may have just saved the whole run.

198
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,580
I think I saved the entire run.

199
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:13,850
Run actually may be saved right now if I get giant.

200
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,409
Run is safe.

201
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:09,769
I think that's fine.

202
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,899
Turn auto aim on.

203
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:16,629
Why would I turn auto aim on?

204
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,309
Lightning damage increased by 12.

205
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:20,309
Increased lightning area of effect.

206
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,350
It's probably that.

207
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,190
Or it's the fast one.

208
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,259
I'm going to go fast.

209
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:31,379
Am I actually even moving faster?

210
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:34,700
I don't feel like I'm moving faster.

211
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,879
Am I crazy?

212
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:51,700
That one.

213
00:15:51,700 --> 00:16:18,500
That one.

214
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,779
I'm actually kicking my feet right now.

215
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,139
I thought I moved out of the way.

216
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm dead.

217
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,500
Huh?

218
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,320
One more try.

219
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,720
One more try.

220
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,120
I swear to God.

221
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,519
One more try.

222
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,480
One more try and that's it.

223
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,840
One more try.

224
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,240
One more try.

225
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,039
One more try.

226
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,799
I don't like that weapon.

227
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,279
Last try.

228
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:04,599
Last try.

229
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,160
One more try.

230
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,799
That's it.

231
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,160
That weapon, I don't like that weapon.

232
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,059
I'm going to do grenade launcher.

233
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:26,630
What?

234
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,269
I want to try that.

235
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:28,150
That sounds cool.

236
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,349
With the grenade launcher?

237
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,329
Grenade launcher is wicked good.

238
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:35,190
All right.

239
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,230
Bullet damage in...

240
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,589
Okay, probably bullet damage.

241
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:42,869
And vision range and pickup range versus...

242
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:48,380
How can I put anything in?

243
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,859
Holy shit.

244
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,500
That's good.

245
00:17:49,500 --> 00:18:00,150
How much is this?

246
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,670
Thirty one fifty.

247
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:14,779
Twelve thousand.

248
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:15,019
All right.

249
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:15,900
Let's try this.

250
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,779
I got Abby and grenade launcher.

251
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:22,869
I'm playing on the hard mode.

252
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,710
So don't tell me I'm not playing on hard mode.

253
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,529
That seems kind of good.

254
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:36,220
It's impossible to lose this.

255
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,980
Yeah, this is not possible to lose this, by the way.

256
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,740
So I would vote for me if I were you.

257
00:18:39,740 --> 00:19:01,910
I thought I got hit.

258
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,349
Okay, so what do I want here?

259
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,529
Bullet damage.

260
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:06,329
Definitely that.

261
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:07,609
And knockback.

262
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:12,059
Bullet speed is pretty good.

263
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,220
Yeah, I want huge explosions.

264
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,500
I don't care about the dragon.

265
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Do the dragon?

266
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,059
Why?

267
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,599
I want big explosive bomb stuff.

268
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,869
Nobody believes in me.

269
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:27,750
Get the dragon egg.

270
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,950
In three minutes a dragon hatch is fine.

271
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,230
That'll be worth it.

272
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,670
They said better be worth it.

273
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:50,019
Do I still got it?

274
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,589
Do I still got it?

275
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:57,049
Enjoy your stars set on...

276
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:02,579
Yes, I do.

277
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:09,990
I think it's this.

278
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,779
I don't have any idea what he says.

279
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:14,779
What does the Archmage say in Warcraft 3?

280
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:15,980
I don't know what he says.

281
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,440
In fury for stars set on is all I know.

282
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,160
What does he actually...

283
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,119
I have no idea.

284
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,380
I've never known.

285
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,819
In fury for stars set on...

286
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:38,200
What does he actually say?

287
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,789
Any you know?

288
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:41,349
I don't know, dude.

289
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,069
Don't ask.

290
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:44,279
This is from Warcraft 3.

291
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,609
It's Latin.

292
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:56,440
He says, help me, I'm in a Blizzard game.

293
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,400
Oh, yeah.

294
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,319
Help me, I'm in a Blizzard game set on.

295
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,319
What does he say?

296
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,359
Do I have to look this up?

297
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:08,940
There's a fucking hundred million people here.

298
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,740
Do I actually have to look up his voice lines?

299
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:19,349
Archmage voice lines Warcraft 3.

300
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:21,640
What does he say?

301
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,559
How does nobody know this?

302
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:32,089
Perfect.

303
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:37,450
Right, right, right.

304
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,680
Well, perfect.

305
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,240
Whatever.

306
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,450
To battle.

307
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,170
Okay.

308
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,450
For glory.

309
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:49,769
Okay.

310
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,180
There it is.

311
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,660
All right.

312
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,220
The music's too loud.

313
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,779
Hold on.

314
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:55,339
This is important.

315
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:57,480
How do I turn the music down?

316
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,420
How do I turn the music down?

317
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,029
Okay, here you go.

318
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,359
This is it right here.

319
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,339
That's what he says.

320
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:13,980
What does he say?

321
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,670
Whatever.

322
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:34,230
Who cares?

323
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,900
All right, let's go.

324
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,700
What am I doing?

325
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,869
I don't think I want that.

326
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:43,430
Maybe I do.

327
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,480
Trained dragon.

328
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,920
He's speaking Swedish?

329
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,460
Is that Swedish?

330
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,650
It's nuts.

331
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,779
Okay.

332
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:58,839
Your dragon gains 10% attack speed every 60 seconds.

333
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,160
All right.

334
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,839
So let's do that.

335
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,640
Even in the egg.

336
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:08,339
I can't believe nobody knew that.

337
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:13,079
How come all of you...

338
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,900
How come none of you guys are also like 35 plus year old dorks like me?

339
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,740
I wonder if it's a rapid fire rate.

340
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,220
Your dragon gains 8 damage every 60 seconds.

341
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,500
While in the egg as well.

342
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,259
Okay, well, we're doing all dragon then.

343
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:55,819
All right.

344
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:57,700
Dragon again.

345
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,900
Your bullets deal additional damage equal to 10% of your dragon's damage.

346
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,420
Well, I mean, we're just doing it.

347
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:18,019
Stop.

348
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,589
Stop!

349
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,559
Yeah, the auto reload is fucking me up.

350
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,200
Turn it off.

351
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,069
It's cutting me off.

352
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:42,759
How do you reload?

353
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:52,099
All right.

354
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:52,980
Come on, man.

355
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,059
Is it R?

356
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,980
That's...

357
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,299
Okay.

358
00:25:58,299 --> 00:25:59,259
This is huge.

359
00:25:59,259 --> 00:25:59,740
Yeah.

360
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,539
Huge bullets.

361
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:09,769
Huge damage.

362
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:10,250
Yes.

363
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,730
All right.

364
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,609
Come on, man.

365
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:23,019
I gotta collect.

366
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:23,660
Oh my goodness.

367
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,299
That's right click.

368
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,099
That's what happens.

369
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:31,779
What do we got?

370
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:35,029
Double how fast Abby fires during her special.

371
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:35,589
Sure.

372
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:44,220
Should I take the health or bullet damage and piercing?

373
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,849
I don't know.

374
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:54,009
Why do you not have any pupils?

375
00:26:54,009 --> 00:27:01,900
Can you see?

376
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,380
I do.

377
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,819
It's just the way the lighting is.

378
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:04,220
Not a room.

379
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,019
Come on.

380
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:09,140
Maybe it is ghost friend.

381
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,200
Or should we just do all damage?

382
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:13,559
Always.

383
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,519
They pierce killed enemies.

384
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:24,710
Maybe I'll be safe.

385
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,670
Yeah, I'll be safe.

386
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,210
I have plenty of damage right now.

387
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:39,579
I have to wrap around and go in the middle there.

388
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:39,900
All right.

389
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,539
Dragons here.

390
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:41,180
Finally.

391
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,349
What's the dragon doing for damage?

392
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:44,759
Forty...

393
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,880
That's actually really good.

394
00:27:45,880 --> 00:28:01,079
Bullet speed.

395
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,519
That's huge because...

396
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:02,759
Yeah.

397
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,480
I think it's that.

398
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,160
It's either that or it's...

399
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,420
I don't know.

400
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,059
Haste.

401
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:16,980
I don't have any move speed.

402
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,700
It has to be this.

403
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,019
Yeah.

404
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:24,579
There's nothing else it would be.

405
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:25,859
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

406
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:26,579
Bad idea.

407
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,220
Bad idea.

408
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,779
Bad idea.

409
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:28,339
Bad idea.

410
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:28,900
Bad idea.

411
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,619
Very bad idea.

412
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,200
These hurt me.

413
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,720
That was a terrible idea.

414
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,029
Whose idea was that?

415
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,019
It runs over.

416
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:39,819
It runs over.

417
00:28:39,819 --> 00:29:05,589
I didn't know that it was...

418
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:07,720
I didn't know that that was going to do that.

419
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,799
I thought it was going to explode into just little pellets,

420
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:11,480
not into other bombs that...

421
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,460
This is the last try.

422
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,500
And then we're going to play Disney Infinity 3.0.

423
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:24,279
I actually like this weapon, but now that I...

424
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:24,519
All right.

425
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,000
Let's go.

426
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,319
Come on.

427
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:28,220
I'm going both headphones for this, by the way.

428
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:50,069
We'll do the same thing.

429
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:50,789
Dragon egg.

430
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,839
It's really early.

431
00:29:52,839 --> 00:30:11,849
Dragon.

432
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:14,180
Eight more damage every 60 seconds.

433
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,299
It's super early.

434
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:37,109
Dragon again.

435
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:38,069
Super early.

436
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:55,529
That's really dangerous with this character.

437
00:30:55,529 --> 00:31:05,190
Oh my goodness.

438
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:39,369
I don't...

439
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:41,690
That move is not something I should be doing ever.

440
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,500
Unless it's an absolutely desperate scenario.

441
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:55,099
10% attack speed.

442
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:55,740
Yes.

443
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,690
When this dragon hatches, it's going to be better.

444
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:05,079
I need blast radius or something, right?

445
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:36,059
Collect.

446
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:47,269
Double.

447
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,910
Yeah.

448
00:32:47,910 --> 00:33:04,119
Wrap around.

449
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:15,700
I need that shit.

450
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,019
All right.

451
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:17,940
I'm a little more confident than I just was.

452
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,269
I am way more confident now.

453
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:25,619
Surprises of face cam?

454
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,079
I started doing face cam every case.

455
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,559
So I played Elden Ring for a month straight with a face cam on,

456
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,759
and then I just never turned it off.

457
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,819
After not doing face cam for like almost 10 years.

458
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,660
Very rarely if I did a horror game or something.

459
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,269
Yeah.

460
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:44,140
Big shot.

461
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:54,009
That's much better.

462
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:54,410
All right.

463
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:54,970
There we go.

464
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:55,609
Let's go.

465
00:33:55,609 --> 00:34:12,059
Give us the chest.

466
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:15,420
Move speed and reload rate by 35% for two seconds after reloading.

467
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,059
Pretty good.

468
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:16,539
Wait.

469
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:24,969
That's not good.

470
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:25,849
That's not good.

471
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:28,250
Because that is going to come out of nowhere,

472
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,550
and I'm going to run into something.

473
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,429
It is good.

474
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:35,349
But I'm used to moving at a certain, you know, knots per second, whatever.

475
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,710
And if I just speed up randomly after killing,

476
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,150
I'm going to hit something.

477
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,380
For two seconds?

478
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:43,860
OK.

479
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,260
After reloading, I'm going to be going like this.

480
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,280
I'm going to reload, and then I'm going to stop.

481
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,059
I don't want to adapt.

482
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,820
I already know how the character moves.

483
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,670
This fell on the ground, and I'm going to do this.

484
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:16,570
Now it's new.

485
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,369
Eww.

486
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:30,179
This boomer is incapable of adapting.

487
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:32,500
If I kill all the people that are telling me to take this, then fine.

488
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,619
When I die, you go, wow, I can't believe I trusted him.

489
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:37,179
Then you'll see.

490
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,000
No, it's not this.

491
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,480
No, it is.

492
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,000
It is.

493
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,639
No, it's this.

494
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:50,920
It's Holy Shield for sure.

495
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,119
Just eat a free damage.

496
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:52,940
Yeah.

497
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,420
It's that.

498
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:05,880
Let's go.

499
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,239
I have so much damage.

500
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:11,059
It's just a question of when I'm going to end up killing myself,

501
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:13,139
like accidentally with the explosion.

502
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:36,730
You can do that.

503
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,090
Dragon is sick, by the way.

504
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,409
All right.

505
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:40,380
Come on.

506
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,980
Reload rate, 20%.

507
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,650
That's very good.

508
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,369
We want that.

509
00:36:45,369 --> 00:37:10,010
Look at how fast I am.

510
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,530
Boss is incoming here in a minute.

511
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:24,570
10%.

512
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,659
Ooh, that's good too.

513
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:32,039
I think it's this, the ammo and the reload rate.

514
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:43,909
All right, here we go.

515
00:37:43,909 --> 00:38:00,710
Don't blow it.

516
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,780
Yeah.

517
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,340
OK.

518
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,929
Something in my teeth.

519
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:10,920
Bullet bounce.

520
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,860
Oh, boy.

521
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,199
Is this bad?

522
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:33,079
I have the dragon.

523
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,760
The dragon is doing 40 damage.

524
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,300
So do I want the dragon to be doing what?

525
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,119
Like 60 to 70 damage?

526
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,559
And me be able to shoot and supplement the dragon?

527
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,030
This is going to bounce off people and come back, explode, and kill me.

528
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,909
We're not doing that.

529
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:59,210
This is awful.

530
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,090
These are all bad.

531
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:06,570
Triple your base max ammo, but 50% less damage.

532
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,889
I'm not taking it.

533
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:13,110
It's not happening.

534
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:39,670
Wait, I didn't take it.

535
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,630
No, I'm not taking it.

536
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:48,150
It's a bad idea.

537
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,889
Curse?

538
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:55,769
Health was going to be the second thing I was going to do.

539
00:39:55,769 --> 00:40:13,780
I want this box to go away, please.

540
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:41,059
I...

541
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:41,619
Whatever.

542
00:40:41,619 --> 00:41:08,710
See, I knew that was going to happen.

543
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,739
I was going to get too close to the explosion.

544
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:44,730
You need to start pretending.

545
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,610
Start pretending what?

546
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:49,400
Pretend what?

547
00:41:49,400 --> 00:42:01,219
Fresh clip first one.

548
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,179
That's actually a really...

549
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:02,820
Yeah, that's a good choice.

550
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:14,599
You're right.

551
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,719
What the fuck?

552
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,760
Oh, it was...

553
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,480
Whatever.

554
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,360
OK, come on.

555
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:37,769
Don't lose it now.

556
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:39,130
They're so fast.

557
00:42:39,130 --> 00:43:08,389
As much as you're...

558
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:09,829
This is going to do 100 something damage.

559
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:32,360
This is going to be huge.

560
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:47,750
Oh, I think I want to do pick up range at this point.

561
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,780
Curse is good, but I need to level.

562
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,500
I have to.

563
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,789
I have to level up.

564
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:54,230
I need to be able to pick stuff up.

565
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:11,260
Am I invincible during that?

566
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,840
I feel like I just was.

567
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:19,190
Can somebody confirm?

568
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,809
Fuck, I'm losing it.

569
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:23,929
It's the piercing.

570
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,380
The piercing is fucking me up.

571
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,590
The piercing is fucking me up because I'm shooting...

572
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,670
I'm expecting it to blow up on somebody,

573
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,429
but it goes through them and blows up after them.

574
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:34,389
That was a mistake.

575
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:37,019
Sorry, all the believers.

576
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:37,980
This might be a problem.

577
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:42,949
This might be a problem.

578
00:44:42,949 --> 00:45:06,230
See what I mean?

579
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,869
See what I mean?

580
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:07,269
I just...

581
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:08,869
It's nothing I can do about it.

582
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:10,869
It's going through people and I can't walk forward

583
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:12,949
because if I walk forward and I shoot somebody,

584
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:15,610
I'm going to get hit by the explosion.

585
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,489
I fucked it up.

586
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:21,989
It's all right.

587
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:23,750
It's all right.

588
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,309
All right.

589
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:24,809
All right.

590
00:45:28,630 --> 00:46:29,659
How much does this cost?

591
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:45,769
This game's fun.

592
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:46,809
All right, goodbye.

593
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:47,530
All right, we're moving on.

594
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,170
Moving on, moving on.

595
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,130
All right, all right, all right, right.

596
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:53,449
Moving on, moving on, moving on.

597
00:46:53,449 --> 00:47:04,199
That was so much fun.

598
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:09,460
Okay, so...

599
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,469
You know what I'm going to do?

600
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:16,309
I'm going to take a nice cold shower.

601
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:18,360
I'm not cold, you know, like lukewarm.

602
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,739
It's going to be great.

603
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:23,079
I did, in that big break,

604
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:26,920
I did a witch hazel wipe,

605
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,210
freshening me up a bit.

606
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:38,940
All good.

607
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,150
Skincare stream.

608
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:49,590
Peep the elbow.

609
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:54,619
It's fine.

610
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:57,179
It's just because sitting here

611
00:47:57,179 --> 00:47:58,460
with my elbows on it for a while.

612
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,780
5 a.m. Eastern.

613
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,260
We're getting close.

614
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:04,659
Okay, let me...

615
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:16,250
All right, I hope this is not too intense.

616
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:28,039
We'll find out.

617
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,480
Because of the camera saturation

618
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,920
that it looks like that, probably.

619
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,659
Let me see.

620
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:40,150
Yeah, it's just, there's a lot of effects

621
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,670
on this right now because we put them on

622
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,510
to try to make the camera look better.

623
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:49,619
Twitch tracker says the longest stream

624
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,539
was 13 hours and five minutes.

625
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:55,929
Can somebody go confirm to make sure

626
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:56,650
that that's the case?

627
00:48:58,599 --> 00:48:59,480
Let me just bow.

628
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:04,630
I get to 13 hours and five minutes

629
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,150
and then I'm like, hooray, let's turn it off.

630
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,510
And it was actually like 13 hours

631
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,190
and like 10 minutes.

632
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:19,099
14 hours just to be safe.

633
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:25,219
Well, I will go combine the fellowship

634
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:25,860
in two towers.

635
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,929
Yeah, I'm good for it.

636
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:30,409
I'm okay.

637
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,250
I still got this.

638
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,530
I drank this whole thing.

639
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:42,460
So I'm going to do high HP and the bow.

640
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:42,940
Maybe not.

641
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,460
What's the one I haven't played with?

642
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:46,389
Dual SMGs.

643
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:51,780
Upgrades apply separately to each gun.

644
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:53,590
That's interesting.

645
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:58,809
These good.

646
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:04,949
I feel like I could have gotten this

647
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:05,590
to work really well.

648
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,469
Let me try the bow.

649
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:12,730
Let me see if I can make this work.

650
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:19,289
When I reload, they come back.

651
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:24,579
So you want insane reload speed then.

652
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:27,460
You want reload speed, ammo, and piercing.

653
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:32,170
I walked into the tree.

654
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,340
Forgot that the tree was evil.

655
00:50:36,340 --> 00:51:03,659
Oh my God, you're gambling on this?

656
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:05,340
I don't know if that's a good idea.

657
00:51:08,389 --> 00:51:12,809
These all aren't that great for this.

658
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:15,719
Vision range?

659
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:23,500
I don't know, maybe.

660
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,780
I feel like that's safe.

661
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:42,650
Fall in, I believe.

662
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,980
Well, I appreciate it.

663
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:59,480
Yeah, I need way more reload than that.

664
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:05,300
Reload speed.

665
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,340
Fire rate, that would be good.

666
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,050
It's the fire rate.

667
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:24,230
I thought I got out of that.

668
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:30,420
Okay, bullet damage and knockback

669
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,260
or more projectiles.

670
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,940
Probably that because of the pullback.

671
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:42,340
Why do all these people have ones and twos on them?

672
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:42,900
One, two.

673
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,500
What's with the one and the two?

674
00:52:44,500 --> 00:53:15,059
He doesn't know.

675
00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:16,340
I don't know.

676
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:19,900
Oh, it's the prediction choices.

677
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,400
Okay.

678
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:23,929
So you're going to be kind of in little groups

679
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:26,639
of one, two, three, or four, huh?

680
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:28,809
Very interesting.

681
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:39,519
Ghost friend?

682
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:40,719
Just one or two?

683
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:43,469
Predicted yet?

684
00:53:43,469 --> 00:53:44,429
Oh, I thought it was...

685
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,710
Oh, no, it's not a pull.

686
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,929
Wait, can't you do more than...

687
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:49,050
Oh, no, I thought it...

688
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:50,730
Okay, I thought it was a pull for a second.

689
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:53,000
That's been 13 hours.

690
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:02,139
I'm good.

691
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:05,119
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

692
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,619
I'm fine, I'll be okay.

693
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:11,019
I really thought that there was four options.

694
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:19,519
Great, did he predict yes or no?

695
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:21,519
How about yes two and no two?

696
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:26,670
There's no way he's going to beat this

697
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:29,789
with the least amount of brain cells.

698
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:33,260
You know what's crazy?

699
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,980
I think that that would make it easier

700
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,570
because I'm not sitting here going like,

701
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,849
oh my God, I have to watch out.

702
00:54:39,849 --> 00:54:40,969
Wake up with those bad guys.

703
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:41,849
How much health do I have?

704
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,690
No, I'm just kind of like just sitting here.

705
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:49,280
So I don't know, you may have picked wrong defense.

706
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,050
Even the boss comes out.

707
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:54,840
That's better.

708
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,000
Yeah, it's that fire rate and ammo.

709
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:14,199
I would love more projectiles.

710
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:24,460
Bullet bounce, bullet speed.

711
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,019
That's okay.

712
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,780
Dark Arts is pretty good.

713
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:32,559
Probably the fire rate.

714
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,880
10% is bad though.

715
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,639
I'll do Dark Arts.

716
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:45,230
You know what's insane?

717
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:50,090
I beat the ultra kill act two campaign seven hours ago.

718
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,449
I forgot I did that.

719
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,769
It's absolutely been an omega gaming weekend.

720
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:57,130
Day.

721
00:55:58,329 --> 00:55:59,880
Friday.

722
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,079
Fish game.

723
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,480
Oh yeah, that game was fun.

724
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:19,210
I genuinely enjoyed that game.

725
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,090
Oh boy.

726
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:30,159
Fire rate and really, I hate this one.

727
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:32,519
But I mean, why not take it?

728
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:39,199
It's kind of good.

729
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:49,130
Yeah, well, I'll take the,

730
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:58,989
remember when I ate the French bread pizza?

731
00:56:58,989 --> 00:56:59,550
It was great.

732
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,360
In case you forgot.

733
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:15,559
Oh my God, are you serious?

734
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:18,599
Oh, guys, there's still a piece left.

735
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:19,800
I still have a half a piece left.

736
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,960
Oh my, so good.

737
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:47,039
I'm hitting E instead of W.

738
00:57:47,039 --> 00:58:13,630
Collect.

739
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:29,690
These all kind of suck.

740
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,150
Well, for what I'm doing.

741
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:42,860
This character is really cool though.

742
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:43,900
I like the mechanic.

743
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:55,179
This is the moment of truth here.

744
00:58:55,179 --> 00:59:14,780
Oh, he's still alive.

745
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,500
Holy shit.

746
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:18,510
Shield.

747
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:32,300
All right.

748
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,019
Movement speed.

749
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:34,219
Big.

750
00:59:34,219 --> 00:59:37,449
Bullet damage, bullet size and piercing.

751
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:42,139
Big.

752
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:42,780
It's that.

753
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:47,210
Fire rate, but still the damage is crazy.

754
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,119
I was here.

755
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:51,099
Wait, did I do it?

756
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:56,940
Is this officially the longest stream I've ever done?

757
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:57,739
All right.

758
00:59:57,739 --> 01:00:03,360
Cool.

759
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,440
13 hours and five minutes.

760
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,679
And I didn't drop a single frame unless I downloaded the game.

761
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:18,429
You know what's really funny?

762
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:22,860
Okay, so when was that Lord of the Rings stream?

763
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,949
2017?

764
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:26,829
2018?

765
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:36,730
2019?

766
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:39,320
Four years ago.

767
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,159
I think I'm on record saying after.

768
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:47,739
When I took that big break when I was gone for like three months,

769
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:49,900
it was on January 11, 2020.

770
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,639
Okay, so this hasn't been that long,

771
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:54,679
but I think when I came back from the long break,

772
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:55,800
like four months,

773
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:00,429
I think I said I will never ever do a stream

774
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:13,039
that's longer than 12 hours ever again.

775
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,849
I guess not.

776
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:18,489
So what now?

777
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:22,239
For every second I'm setting the tone for,

778
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:24,400
it's got to be a number that I want, right?

779
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,519
It's got to be a number that I like.

780
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:32,349
I don't like 13, though.

781
01:01:32,349 --> 01:01:39,150
13?

782
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,510
13 is an odd number.

783
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:50,940
It's not that much longer.

784
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,960
Okay, how about 13?

785
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,739
Wait, dude, what if I do?

786
01:01:57,739 --> 01:01:58,780
Oh, watch this shit.

787
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,820
Everyone's going to hate me for this.

788
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,840
1337 is so dumb.

789
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,440
Absolute worst number.

790
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,610
It's funny because I could do that and that would be it forever.

791
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:13,000
133737.

792
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,480
But 133700, it's so bad.

793
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:23,070
But I think actually I might be mad that I did that.

794
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,469
Months or years later, I might be like, really?

795
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:29,900
That's what I decided to do.

796
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:37,789
123456 would have been so perfect,

797
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:42,429
but it's too bad 12 hours was 12 hours and 56 minutes,

798
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:45,960
but 12 hours and 45 minutes, whatever.

799
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,360
I would have loved 123456.

800
01:02:49,360 --> 01:03:11,900
Let's go.

801
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,860
Oh, that's cool.

802
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,780
I really didn't think I was ever going to do this ever again.

803
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:28,030
And like I said, I know that a 13 hour stream is really not.

804
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,469
Wow. Oh my God.

805
01:03:29,469 --> 01:03:33,679
I'm one of the only streamers ever to do a 13.

806
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:36,000
I know people do this regularly all the time.

807
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:43,690
Oh, man.

808
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,610
I'm not even sure I would be able to do more than 14, 13 or 14 hours.

809
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:48,969
Back when I was like 20.

810
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:50,349
I don't know.

811
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:51,150
I don't know how people do it.

812
01:03:51,949 --> 01:03:55,400
Because you know what it is?

813
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:00,909
It's not just the fact that you're, whatever, 13 hours.

814
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:04,349
There are a lot of people that work 13 hour days,

815
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:05,789
12 hour days, 10 hour shifts.

816
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:06,590
Right.

817
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:08,829
It's a lot.

818
01:04:09,869 --> 01:04:13,159
I think the major difference with like a stream is

819
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,199
I've been kind of sitting in the same spot.

820
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,360
I've gone to the bathroom once or twice

821
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,119
and I've eaten pizza at the desk for like 14 hours.

822
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:27,400
So it's like it's like the low amount of movement

823
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:32,219
is I think like the killer and like the visual stimulation.

824
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:38,969
But yeah, let me be very, very, very clear.

825
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:42,809
The reason why I don't do 10 plus hour streams

826
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:45,769
is because I don't want to, right?

827
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:50,519
Get up once in a while and do stretches.

828
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:57,880
Yeah, you do a lot of content for 14 hours.

829
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:07,400
Um, I mean, it's for me, it's not.

830
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,119
Maybe I don't know.

831
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:09,719
I'm trying to think of a way that I could word it.

832
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:15,920
I think I expel a lot of energy on the stream.

833
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:17,559
A lot.

834
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:21,039
It's the end.

835
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,519
I think it's just the kind of the way that I am.

836
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:39,039
But yeah, it's not, uh, I'm not trying to say that like,

837
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,840
oh my gosh, guys, streaming is so hard.

838
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,940
No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

839
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:53,840
You know, would you ever do a 24 hour?

840
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,199
No, not in a million years.

841
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,440
Not in a hundred million years.

842
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,510
Oh my God.

843
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:01,550
Don't, I'm dead.

844
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:04,139
I looked at that at the end.

845
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:18,539
What about a thousand million years?

846
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,210
Yeah, it's just like my body and brain just can't

847
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:26,619
do that for more than like 10 to 12 hours usually.

848
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:28,380
After hour number five or six is when I'm kind of like,

849
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,920
yeah, I'm done.

850
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,599
But look, more power to you.

851
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:35,599
If you can really do that for more than 12, 13, 14 hours all the time.

852
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:42,460
Although I would say that, um, it's probably not that healthy to do this that often.

853
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,159
Um, another, one of the reasons why I don't really do this that often is because I,

854
01:06:47,159 --> 01:06:52,300
I have a lot of health problems and I could really probably fuck myself up if I did too much.

855
01:06:53,289 --> 01:06:54,809
13, 13 is coming up.

856
01:06:54,809 --> 01:06:56,809
That's kind of interesting.

857
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,969
13, 13, 13.

858
01:06:58,969 --> 01:07:02,619
Nah, no, no, no.

859
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:04,840
You can burn out.

860
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,960
Yeah, I don't want to burn out either.

861
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,599
That's another thing too.

862
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,510
I don't, I really don't want to burn out.

863
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:11,469
Kind of interesting.

864
01:07:11,469 --> 01:07:22,699
I think you, you can, when you go through all your oil and there's not much left,

865
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:26,760
it's, um, it's really long-term.

866
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,559
It's really not great for you.

867
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:30,139
It's really not a good thing.

868
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:31,019
Is he sleepy?

869
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:31,900
I'm kind of sleepy.

870
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:39,449
13, 13, 13, 13.

871
01:07:39,449 --> 01:07:43,260
No, no, let's wind down.

872
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,380
It ends when it ends.

873
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:49,980
This game is really fun though, too.

874
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:56,809
20 minutes till dawn.

875
01:07:56,809 --> 01:08:06,960
Um, let me see here.

876
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,599
Let me see.

877
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,400
How was I at the end of that two towers, Vaude?

878
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:20,300
Wait, how come Lord of the Rings of Two Towers is nine hours and 40 minutes?

879
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,300
How come this is shorter?

880
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:33,789
It was two Vaudes.

881
01:08:33,789 --> 01:08:35,470
Oh, it's split up by the game.

882
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:35,949
Okay.

883
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:46,960
It's a 12-hour limit.

884
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,840
Oh, right.

885
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,920
Okay.

886
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,840
Yeah, so that's going to be the end of the stream.

887
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,840
I'll see you guys later.

888
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,739
I don't, uh, Omega Weekend sort of turned into, uh,

889
01:08:57,739 --> 01:09:00,380
beat my old longest stream ever record.

890
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:04,909
I guess, I guess they are one and the same,

891
01:09:04,909 --> 01:09:10,060
but I do still have a dozen and a half more games to play.

892
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:20,539
So these don't have to go away.

893
01:09:20,539 --> 01:09:21,500
Keep an eye on the sus.

894
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:26,140
Uh, if it's Sunday or Monday, maybe it'll be Sunday.

895
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,579
It's definitely not going to be tomorrow.

896
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:28,539
Or today.

897
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:28,939
What is it?

898
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:30,699
Like 6 a.m. for a lot of you guys.

899
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:31,880
10 a.m.

900
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,760
Saturday.

901
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:39,020
I'll play Splatoon 3 and I'll play, I won't do a Switch night.

902
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:45,359
Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 3, some other things that are on Switch.

903
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,760
Or maybe I'll just play Breath of the Wild.

904
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,000
It's time to play it, right?

905
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,479
Should I just do it?

906
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:52,960
I don't know.

907
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:59,279
Is it time to just do it at some point in the next week?

908
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:09,039
Next few days?

909
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:10,430
Yes.

910
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:10,750
Okay.

911
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,439
Please stream.

912
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:17,479
What did you say?

913
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:21,520
Please stream on the weekends for us working Andes.

914
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,199
I like streaming on the weekends.

915
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,890
Breath of the Wild is a perfect game for you.

916
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:35,819
Put sus for Saturday or Sunday?

917
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:38,460
I would put sus for Sunday.

918
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:41,420
Sunday slash Monday.

919
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:49,390
Gears of War is on Switch?

920
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:54,699
Omega Weekend.

921
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:57,920
So Monday.

922
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,829
I don't know.

923
01:11:00,829 --> 01:11:01,470
Who knows?

924
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,430
I might just show up.

925
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,149
Just go.

926
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:11,359
Can I trade you Omega Weekend for Omega Record Stream Breaker?

927
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,430
We'll see.

928
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:17,229
I don't know.

929
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:22,810
It's very possible that tomorrow or Sunday, I'm just like, whatever, let's go.

930
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:23,050
No.

931
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:35,020
Oath Breaker.

932
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,100
That's not what we agreed to, Elbertson.

933
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:41,840
We didn't agree to this.

934
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,239
I'll be back in here tomorrow afternoon to increase or offline chat.

935
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,199
We'll figure it out.

936
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:58,319
What about a Twitch moment badge for longest stream?

937
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:00,939
Wait, can I do that?

938
01:12:00,939 --> 01:12:02,220
Wait, hold on.

939
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,260
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

940
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:04,539
Is that, can I do that?

941
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,520
How do I do that?

942
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,569
Can I actually do that right now?

943
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:13,289
Yeah.

944
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:14,329
Wait, how?

945
01:12:14,329 --> 01:12:25,819
Does anybody know?

946
01:12:25,819 --> 01:12:29,210
Do slash moment.

947
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:30,890
Slash moment.

948
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:37,159
Clip moments on stream and recognize viewers that were there with a commemorative badge.

949
01:12:37,159 --> 01:12:37,800
Oh, okay.

950
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:43,960
So hold on.

951
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:44,840
Like right now?

952
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,399
What if I do this?

953
01:12:45,399 --> 01:12:52,250
So I go like this?

954
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:58,430
If you're seeing this clip right now, you were one of the few people that were here

955
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:01,340
for my longest stream ever.

956
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:10,590
13 hours, 18 minutes, and 37 seconds.

957
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,310
Thanks for hanging out.

958
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,609
And now, do I do it now?

959
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:21,289
13 hours and 20 minutes.

960
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:22,409
Moment time.

961
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:25,840
Reward viewers for being part of this moment.

962
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,880
Viewers of this moment will receive a clip added to their moments page.

963
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:32,750
You have five moments for this month.

964
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:34,829
Longest stream ever.

965
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:40,670
13 hours, 18 minutes, 37 seconds.

966
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:44,760
Oh, it worked.

967
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,439
Thanks for hanging out.

968
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:48,800
Do I do it now?

969
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,840
No, no, no, no, hold on.

970
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,479
No, no, no, no, no, no.

971
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:51,199
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

972
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:51,520
Hold on.

973
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,800
I know, I probably wouldn't want to go to bed.

974
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,920
That was not a good one.

975
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,739
Slash moment.

976
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:56,460
Okay, here we go.

977
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:02,000
Ready?

978
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,199
You were here for the longest stream I've ever done on this channel.

979
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:11,199
13 hours, 19 minutes, and 41 seconds.

980
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:16,829
Ain't ever going to happen again.

981
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:18,350
What, what, yeah.

982
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:19,149
Let's start over.

983
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,449
Hey, you, I feel like I'm making a YouTube video again.

984
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:31,279
I feel like I'm making a fucking YouTube video again.

985
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:33,739
You know how many times I would sit here and do this shit?

986
01:14:33,739 --> 01:14:38,359
I would sit here over and over and over and over again doing this.

987
01:14:38,359 --> 01:14:39,000
Hey, you.

988
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:43,000
I used to sit, I can't do it.

989
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,289
Okay, I was just going to close my eyes.

990
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:47,529
No, I'm just, okay, I'm going to look over here.

991
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:48,569
I'm not going to look at you.

992
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:57,420
Hey, you are one of the few people that stuck around

993
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:01,180
and checked out the longest stream that I've ever done.

994
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:06,880
13 hours, 21 minutes, and seven seconds.

995
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,390
You did.

996
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:10,670
You were here for it.

997
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:11,470
You were here.

998
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,720
Thanks a lot.

999
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:17,239
And now, I think it's time I got a little bit of rest.

1000
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:20,909
How was that?

1001
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:35,050
You are a few people that stuck around and checked out the longest stream that I've ever.

1002
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:36,649
No, no, we're not doing that one.

1003
01:15:36,649 --> 01:15:37,449
We're doing a different one.

1004
01:15:57,359 --> 01:15:59,680
Hey, just want to say thanks.

1005
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,880
You were here for the longest stream that I've ever done.

1006
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,439
13 hours, 21 minutes, and 38 seconds.

1007
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,939
You were here.

1008
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:12,810
You were here.

1009
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:14,810
If you have this moment, if you got this clip,

1010
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:18,189
congratulations, you own it now.

1011
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:19,710
Now, it's time to get some rest.

1012
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:23,180
All right, I did it.

1013
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:23,979
That should be good, right?

1014
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:38,729
I look so funny.

1015
01:16:38,729 --> 01:16:41,449
God, dude, who cares?

1016
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,779
This is the, who cares?

1017
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:09,239
Go watch that.

1018
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:21,079
I screw it up so bad, but who cares?

1019
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:22,439
Did you get, did it work?

1020
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:34,590
Did you claim it?

1021
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:35,390
I claimed it.

1022
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:36,510
All right, cool.

1023
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:38,270
I feel bad for the people that left.

1024
01:17:40,409 --> 01:17:42,569
There's like a couple thousand people left

1025
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:43,770
because they like all the streams over

1026
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:46,829
and they're not going to get the clip.

1027
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:52,060
That's, I feel kind of bad for that.

1028
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:52,939
Wait, what is it?

1029
01:17:53,659 --> 01:17:54,859
Moments badge.

1030
01:17:54,859 --> 01:18:00,300
Why is the moments badge the body of Christ?

1031
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,960
Okay, you got a moment badge.

1032
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,069
All right, am I, did I officially do it?

1033
01:18:15,069 --> 01:18:17,069
I'm so afraid to hit end stream and it turns out,

1034
01:18:17,069 --> 01:18:20,670
oh dude, it was actually 13 minutes in like 34 minutes

1035
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:22,989
or 13 hours and 34 minutes or something.

1036
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:29,579
Should I do another moment?

1037
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,119
Like the 200 people that just left?

1038
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,510
You fucked up.

1039
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:44,840
Hey, just want to say you are one of the only people

1040
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,319
to get this clip of my longest stream.

1041
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:54,140
13 hours, 24 minutes and 25 seconds.

1042
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,430
That's right, this is the longest one I've ever done.

1043
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,060
Thanks for watching.

1044
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,060
It's time for me to get some rest.

1045
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:15,529
Did it work?

1046
01:19:15,529 --> 01:19:18,010
A clip of the moment has failed to capture.

1047
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:23,439
What are you talking about?

1048
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:33,359
Hey, I got banned?

1049
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:37,210
No, I didn't.

1050
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:41,079
I just want to say you are one of the lucky people.

1051
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,340
Why am I banned?

1052
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:46,680
You're one of the lucky people that got this moment,

1053
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:53,319
my longest stream ever at 13 hours, 25 minutes and 24 seconds.

1054
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:57,579
Nobody else has this but you, this few people.

1055
01:19:57,579 --> 01:19:59,710
It's the longest stream I've ever done.

1056
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:01,800
Congratulations, you were here.

1057
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,680
You were here.

1058
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,060
Time to get some rest.

1059
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:22,029
Okay, okay, create moment.

1060
01:20:22,029 --> 01:20:23,710
A clip, it failed.

1061
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:28,970
Can I only do this like once every 10 minutes?

1062
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:32,409
I have four more moments to capture this month.

1063
01:20:32,409 --> 01:20:36,569
I think I'm just going to do this every 10 minutes.

1064
01:20:36,569 --> 01:20:39,470
And like, if you want to claim this moment,

1065
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:40,670
you better stay to the end.

1066
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:49,119
Do all five of them tonight.

1067
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:53,079
Can I look this up?

1068
01:20:53,079 --> 01:20:58,279
When do these moments reset?

1069
01:20:58,279 --> 01:20:59,720
Do all five tonight.

1070
01:21:05,739 --> 01:21:06,699
It's in beta?

1071
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:13,020
At the start of the, yeah, I still have four I can do this month.

1072
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,659
I wonder how long the cooldown is.

1073
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:28,810
Hey, just want to say, you know what time it is?

1074
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:31,609
It's the longest stream ever.

1075
01:21:31,689 --> 01:21:35,850
13 hours, 27 minutes and six seconds.

1076
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:38,090
I think that deserves a quick bite of pizza.

1077
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,920
Thanks for joining me.

1078
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,119
Thanks for sticking around for this long.

1079
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:45,680
I've never done it this, I've never gone this long before.

1080
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,210
And you were here for it.

1081
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:49,039
Thanks for sticking around.

1082
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:51,439
We're here, we're hanging out.

1083
01:21:51,439 --> 01:22:30,359
I'm doing all five of these tonight.

1084
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:41,439
So it looks like it's about five minutes.

1085
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:57,550
The last one, I should just be standing back there.

1086
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:03,159
I'm just going like, you powered through.

1087
01:23:03,159 --> 01:23:04,840
You made it all the way to the end.

1088
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,039
You must be commended for it with this fifth moment.

1089
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:12,090
And then I spin around, bend over forward

1090
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,729
and fart wicked fucking loud into the microphone.

1091
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:24,810
Make the camera wider.

1092
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,279
Just get them progressively more fucking weird, hold on.

1093
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:45,119
If I was like, hey, Jess wanted to say,

1094
01:23:45,119 --> 01:24:05,689
I am so happy that you made it to tonight's stream.

1095
01:24:05,689 --> 01:24:35,319
Hold on a second.

1096
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:39,369
The camera quality is going to get progressively worse.

1097
01:24:39,369 --> 01:24:41,930
So the actual one that you get is going to be the worst one.

1098
01:24:52,909 --> 01:25:03,199
Where did I go?

1099
01:25:26,989 --> 01:25:28,750
I think I actually broke the webcam.

1100
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:40,270
Oh, shit.

1101
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:42,829
Oh, no, it's actually fucked up.

1102
01:25:42,829 --> 01:25:52,489
Hold on.

1103
01:25:52,489 --> 01:25:53,449
Oh, shit.

1104
01:25:57,470 --> 01:26:04,670
Wait, hold on, I might be able to fix it.

1105
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:05,710
Yeah, it's gone.

1106
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:14,029
Hold on, did I get it back?

1107
01:26:14,029 --> 01:26:15,149
Oh, I think I got it.

1108
01:26:15,149 --> 01:26:16,270
Hold on a second, we're good.

1109
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:31,850
Let's see, am I good?

1110
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:49,960
Maybe.

1111
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,100
You can't see though.

1112
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,859
All right, the cooldown is up.

1113
01:26:52,859 --> 01:27:00,880
I got to fucking do it.

1114
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,399
I don't know, what is that?

1115
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:14,890
Oh, it's my fucking neck.

1116
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:25,050
Okay, I got it.

1117
01:27:25,050 --> 01:27:32,489
That looks fine, right?

1118
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:59,689
Okay, you ready?

1119
01:27:59,689 --> 01:28:02,039
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

1120
01:28:02,039 --> 01:28:05,239
13 hours and 33 minutes, you made it.

1121
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:08,729
You made it to the longest stream that I've ever done.

1122
01:28:08,729 --> 01:28:09,770
You got it all the way through.

1123
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:11,609
You were here for this.

1124
01:28:11,609 --> 01:28:12,569
You were here.

1125
01:28:12,569 --> 01:28:17,770
Special thank you to everybody that decided to show up and stick around.

1126
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:21,579
I got a crunch for you.

1127
01:28:21,579 --> 01:28:23,609
Now that one sucked.

1128
01:28:23,609 --> 01:28:38,430
Again, just want to say a huge special thanks to those of you that stuck around

1129
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:41,470
for the longest stream that I have ever done.

1130
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:45,079
We're talking, wow, wowie.

1131
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:52,279
13 hours and 34 minutes with 18 seconds also, which is unbelievable.

1132
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:54,560
Thank you for sticking around.

1133
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,439
This is the longest stream.

1134
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:56,399
I'm never going to do this again.

1135
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:57,520
The longest stream I've ever done.

1136
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,319
Thank you.

1137
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:08,300
Did it work?

1138
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:15,760
Let's go even lower.

1139
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:24,319
Let's make it worse.

1140
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:35,000
I hate that I have to do this every time though.

1141
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:42,560
Oh my goodness, really?

1142
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,119
This looks so bad.

1143
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:12,619
I can't even see it anymore.

1144
01:30:12,619 --> 01:30:14,359
I keep losing it.

1145
01:30:14,359 --> 01:30:18,380
There it is, okay.

1146
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:31,470
Every time I go down in quality, it resets the whole camera and resizes everything.

1147
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:39,819
This is 320 by, I don't know, 320 by like 180 or something.

1148
01:30:39,819 --> 01:30:46,109
It's all blown up and awful.

1149
01:30:46,109 --> 01:30:49,180
Okay, I don't know what the hell that was.

1150
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:54,220
What am I looking at here?

1151
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:17,210
Hey man, I can't believe you made it.

1152
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:21,210
13 hours, 36 minutes and 52 seconds.

1153
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:22,489
God, man, I can't believe.

1154
01:31:22,489 --> 01:31:23,680
You were here.

1155
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,399
You were here.

1156
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:33,529
You were longest stream I've ever done.

1157
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:34,409
Thanks for sticking around.

1158
01:31:34,409 --> 01:31:35,210
I appreciate it, man.

1159
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:37,689
See you later.

1160
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:46,189
Did I even give a time?

1161
01:31:56,779 --> 01:31:58,619
52 seconds stream.

1162
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:07,710
You can't hear that.

1163
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:13,359
Longest stream I've ever done in 52 seconds.

1164
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:14,640
God, man, I can't believe.

1165
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:15,119
You were here.

1166
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,560
You were here.

1167
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:21,710
You were longest stream I've.

1168
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:23,149
That's the beginning of the clip.

1169
01:32:23,149 --> 01:32:24,779
Ever done.

1170
01:32:24,779 --> 01:32:25,819
52 seconds.

1171
01:32:25,819 --> 01:32:27,500
God, I gotta redo it, right?

1172
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:30,220
Should I redo it or is that funny?

1173
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:31,579
What do you think?

1174
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:35,609
Oh, 52 seconds.

1175
01:32:35,609 --> 01:32:37,050
Man, I can't believe we made it.

1176
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,539
Oh, it didn't work.

1177
01:32:42,539 --> 01:33:06,239
Oh, hey.

1178
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:08,640
Oh, I can't believe you're still here.

1179
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:14,760
Wow, 13 hours, 38 minutes and 44 seconds.

1180
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:16,680
Wow, that's the longest stream I've ever done.

1181
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,199
And you were here for it.

1182
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:20,960
Honestly, you know what?

1183
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,199
I think that deserves a little bit of a bite of pizza.

1184
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:35,689
Is the game too loud?

1185
01:33:35,689 --> 01:33:36,329
Oh, shit.

1186
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:39,960
Oh, hey.

1187
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,880
Oh, I can't believe you're still here.

1188
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,079
No, I'll do it again.

1189
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:44,939
Music's too loud.

1190
01:33:44,939 --> 01:33:51,199
The music's way too loud.

1191
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:52,239
Okay, I'm good.

1192
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,250
It wouldn't work anyways.

1193
01:33:56,250 --> 01:34:00,039
Take three.

1194
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:11,079
Oh, hey.

1195
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:13,529
Oh, you're still here.

1196
01:34:13,529 --> 01:34:16,779
Wow, 13 hours, 39 minutes.

1197
01:34:16,779 --> 01:34:18,859
Longest stream I've ever done.

1198
01:34:18,859 --> 01:34:20,569
And you were here for it.

1199
01:34:20,569 --> 01:34:23,369
I'll never do anything longer than this.

1200
01:34:23,369 --> 01:34:25,390
So you're here for it.

1201
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:26,029
Good work.

1202
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,340
Oh, what's that?

1203
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:35,210
Oh, is that some Captain Grunch?

1204
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:35,930
Delicious.

1205
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:47,609
What a reward for 13 hours and 40 minutes.

1206
01:34:47,609 --> 01:34:51,050
13 hours, 39 minutes, longest stream I've ever done.

1207
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:52,090
Oh, fuck you.

1208
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:52,970
It didn't get it.

1209
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:59,210
Where even is this?

1210
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:00,090
Up there.

1211
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:18,079
Where is this?

1212
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:30,539
I don't know where it is.

1213
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:32,989
You know what?

1214
01:35:32,989 --> 01:35:38,649
You made it to 13 hours, 41 minutes and 8 seconds.

1215
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:39,880
You did.

1216
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,720
You were here for this.

1217
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,159
Thank you so much for sticking around.

1218
01:35:43,159 --> 01:35:45,399
Longest stream that I have ever done.

1219
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:47,130
And you're here for it.

1220
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:47,930
Yeah.

1221
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:51,960
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

1222
01:35:51,960 --> 01:36:00,619
quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick quick.

1223
01:36:00,619 --> 01:36:03,560
That's a good one.

1224
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:06,300
I don't understand, I don't know where it is.

1225
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,399
I don't, you know what, you made it to 13 hours,

1226
01:36:10,829 --> 01:36:15,899
41 minutes and a-

1227
01:36:15,899 --> 01:36:18,899
Alright, I'm done doing this.

1228
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:20,020
You should lower your mic quality.

1229
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,260
Dude, I'm not fucked with the mic.

1230
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:25,500
I took me 10 years to get to this point.

1231
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:28,640
I'm doing one more, and I'm just gonna say thanks.

1232
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:34,439
That's 13 hours and 42 minutes, I'm done.

1233
01:36:34,439 --> 01:36:54,000
Do I keep, like, the cringe guy routine going?

1234
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:04,119
Oh my god, I don't know how I'm gonna be able to do this.

1235
01:37:04,119 --> 01:37:20,460
It's so ugly.

1236
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:27,340
What is that?

1237
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:31,380
Okay, that's here.

1238
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:44,880
Hold on, let me find it here.

1239
01:37:44,880 --> 01:39:09,729
Okay, so I need to move it this way.

1240
01:39:09,729 --> 01:39:19,819
Don't ever call the sus guy three.

1241
01:39:19,819 --> 01:39:21,819
13 hours and 44 minutes,

1242
01:39:21,819 --> 01:39:43,819
you made it to the longest stream I've ever done.

1243
01:39:43,819 --> 01:39:53,909
Don't ever call the sus guy three.

1244
01:39:53,909 --> 01:39:55,909
13 hours and 44 minutes,

1245
01:39:55,909 --> 01:39:59,449
you made it to the longest stream I've ever done.

1246
01:39:59,449 --> 01:40:01,810
I was gonna say final stream.

1247
01:40:02,989 --> 01:40:05,930
You made it to the final stream.

1248
01:40:05,930 --> 01:40:08,649
Okay, please tell me this is gonna actually go through.

1249
01:40:09,649 --> 01:40:11,649
No, it didn't go through.

1250
01:40:11,649 --> 01:40:12,489
It didn't go through.

1251
01:40:12,489 --> 01:40:13,310
Somebody clip it.

1252
01:40:13,310 --> 01:40:15,960
Oh, shit.

1253
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:23,270
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1254
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:34,630
Don't ever call the sus guy at three a.m.

1255
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:40,260
You made it 13 hours 46 minutes and 11 seconds.

1256
01:40:43,909 --> 01:40:53,460
You made it to the longest stream I've ever done.

1257
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:54,659
See you on the next one.

1258
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:08,659
I'm gonna cut it off.

1259
01:41:08,659 --> 01:41:10,529
You made it.

1260
01:41:10,529 --> 01:41:13,210
13 hours.

1261
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:15,500
Fuck, God damn it.

1262
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:16,979
All right, I'm doing this one more time and that's it.

1263
01:41:16,979 --> 01:41:22,220
Then I'm done.

1264
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:31,710
Don't ever call the sus guy at three a.m.

1265
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:34,109
You made it to the longest stream I've ever done.

1266
01:41:34,109 --> 01:41:38,390
13 hours 47 minutes and seven seconds.

1267
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:42,710
And your prize is this stupid clip

1268
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:45,510
that you're gonna forget about in two weeks.

1269
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:01,729
What the fuck?

1270
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:03,970
Why does he keep cutting it off?

1271
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:06,369
You made it to the longest stream.

1272
01:42:06,369 --> 01:42:07,649
I'm gonna do it quick.

1273
01:42:07,649 --> 01:42:08,489
This is annoying.

1274
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:12,479
It keeps cutting the beginning off.

1275
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:15,079
Don't ever call the sus guy at three a.m.

1276
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,359
You made it to the longest stream I've ever done

1277
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:29,300
and your reward is the 13 hours 48 minutes zero second.

1278
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,039
You win.

1279
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:35,670
All right, did I get it?

1280
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:37,789
Why does he keep cutting it off?

1281
01:42:38,390 --> 01:42:40,170
You made it to the longest stream.

1282
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:41,289
I'm gonna do it quick.

1283
01:42:41,289 --> 01:42:42,130
What?

1284
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:42,970
This is annoying.

1285
01:42:42,970 --> 01:42:44,289
It keeps cutting the beginning off.

1286
01:42:44,289 --> 01:42:46,329
Now it's only beginning.

1287
01:42:46,329 --> 01:43:06,710
Don't ever call the sus guy at three a.m.

1288
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:08,930
Ah, you made it.

1289
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:11,479
Three a.m.

1290
01:43:11,479 --> 01:43:13,260
Put the phone down.

1291
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:16,350
Don't call me.

1292
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:19,430
13 hours 48 minutes and 50 seconds.

1293
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:21,470
Congratulations.

1294
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:26,619
You've made it to the longest stream I've ever done.

1295
01:43:26,619 --> 01:43:29,979
Congratulations.

1296
01:43:29,979 --> 01:43:32,180
Oh, what's that?

1297
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:37,119
A pizza.

1298
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:38,319
Shit, it doesn't work.

1299
01:43:38,319 --> 01:43:50,260
This is not connected to the right mic.

1300
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:53,380
13 hours 48 minutes and 50 seconds.

1301
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:55,390
Congratulations.

1302
01:43:55,390 --> 01:43:57,989
You've made it to the longest stream I've ever done.

1303
01:43:57,989 --> 01:43:59,069
Put the phone down.

1304
01:43:59,069 --> 01:44:00,590
Don't call me.

1305
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:03,909
Congratulations.

1306
01:44:03,909 --> 01:44:04,829
Oh, what's that?

1307
01:44:06,119 --> 01:44:11,079
A pizza.

1308
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:11,920
Shit, it doesn't.

1309
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,600
Put the phone down.

1310
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,000
Whatever, you, here it is.

1311
01:44:16,539 --> 01:44:17,380
There it is.

1312
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,460
There it is, your actual clip.

1313
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:22,340
Goodbye.

1314
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,680
Don't put the phone down.

1315
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:25,439
Don't call me.

1316
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:27,079
Oh my God.

1317
01:44:27,079 --> 01:44:27,899
All right, that's it.

1318
01:44:27,899 --> 01:44:29,779
That's the last one.

1319
01:44:29,779 --> 01:44:32,109
That's it.

1320
01:44:32,109 --> 01:44:32,949
Who cares?

1321
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:46,039
We're almost at 14 hours I'm staying.

1322
01:44:46,039 --> 01:44:46,880
It's 10 minutes.

1323
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,359
I don't like that 13.

1324
01:44:48,359 --> 01:44:51,039
It's gotta be 14.

1325
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:57,090
That's long enough for the ending stuff.

1326
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:57,930
No, thanks for watching.

1327
01:44:57,930 --> 01:44:59,569
I really did not,

1328
01:45:01,939 --> 01:45:04,920
I did not think I was gonna do a 14 hour stream tonight.

1329
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,979
I thought I was gonna do like a six hour stream

1330
01:45:06,979 --> 01:45:08,920
and then like a six hour stream tomorrow

1331
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,199
and then like a four hour stream on Sunday.

1332
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:12,399
But you know, whatever.

1333
01:45:14,069 --> 01:45:16,750
Sometimes you just go for it.

1334
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:17,590
That was fun.

1335
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:23,300
I feel like we did a lot of stuff.

1336
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:33,789
Oh, the mic is wrong, whoops.

1337
01:45:33,789 --> 01:45:35,590
Hey, there you are.

1338
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:37,880
That's better, isn't it?

1339
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:38,840
Hi, okay.

1340
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,340
Now you can hear me, cool.

1341
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:50,430
You heard that too, whoops.

1342
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:55,989
Claimed.

1343
01:45:55,989 --> 01:46:02,640
The other mic is better.

1344
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:08,710
Yeah, honest to God, complete real talk.

1345
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:11,409
There is no way I will do a 14 hour stream

1346
01:46:11,409 --> 01:46:23,329
probably ever again.

1347
01:46:23,329 --> 01:46:26,020
Don't think so.

1348
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:27,989
Seaman was 11 hours.

1349
01:46:27,989 --> 01:46:32,460
Lord of the Rings PlayStation 2 games with 13.

1350
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:34,060
This was not a single game.

1351
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:38,300
So there it is at the top of the list.

1352
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:44,300
It is, oh, there it is.

1353
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:48,779
13.4, 13.1, what was 12?

1354
01:46:48,779 --> 01:46:53,239
Lifeline was 12 hours.

1355
01:46:53,239 --> 01:47:01,390
Simpsons Hit and Run was 11.8, so just about 12.

1356
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:05,710
Darkwood, I played Darkwood for 11 and a half hours?

1357
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:07,619
How?

1358
01:47:07,619 --> 01:47:10,479
I don't think I would have been able to do that.

1359
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:17,300
Holy shit.

1360
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:28,640
And then what's this one that's 11.2 hours?

1361
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:32,460
Oh, the thing, right.

1362
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:36,060
Sometimes you're just gaming, that's right.

1363
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:39,680
All right, we got seven minutes.

1364
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,819
What do you wanna talk about?

1365
01:47:41,819 --> 01:47:51,890
Just roll the credits again.

1366
01:47:51,890 --> 01:47:53,729
Imagine not having a tier two badge.

1367
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:01,859
If you claim to all four of those, do you get to,

1368
01:48:01,859 --> 01:48:03,279
by the way, that's probably the only time

1369
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:05,039
I'm ever gonna do moments.

1370
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:10,500
So if you got it, that's probably never happening again.

1371
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,180
My thoughts on Christmas?

1372
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:16,520
I like it, it's cool.

1373
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:18,119
I'm really surprised by the amount of people

1374
01:48:18,119 --> 01:48:19,159
that are still here.

1375
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:27,750
So thanks for staying up or waking up in the morning.

1376
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:38,789
It's gonna be a very long VOD to go through.

1377
01:48:38,789 --> 01:48:43,119
Thanks for fucking my sleep up.

1378
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:46,239
Yeah, I mean, I'm about to go eat a little bit more food,

1379
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:48,890
probably take a shower or a bath or something,

1380
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:51,619
and probably not fall asleep till like four,

1381
01:48:51,619 --> 01:48:53,890
so maybe five.

1382
01:48:53,890 --> 01:48:55,090
I think I'm right there with you.

1383
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:58,789
I think we may have all collectively screwed up

1384
01:48:58,789 --> 01:49:04,970
some sleep schedules.

1385
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:10,770
It's 5 a.m. right now.

1386
01:49:10,770 --> 01:49:12,649
Thanks for fixing my sleep schedule.

1387
01:49:12,649 --> 01:49:13,890
Oh, there we go.

1388
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:21,659
Not all bad.

1389
01:49:22,619 --> 01:49:27,470
Oh man, there it is.

1390
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:35,060
You knew it was coming.

1391
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:36,779
You stream it again this evening?

1392
01:49:36,779 --> 01:49:40,029
No, I don't think so.

1393
01:49:40,029 --> 01:49:41,670
I gotta see how I get up at some point

1394
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:47,460
in the hopefully early afternoon-ish.

1395
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:48,699
I don't wanna get up late though.

1396
01:49:48,699 --> 01:49:50,300
I've been on a really good schedule.

1397
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:52,439
I've been getting up normally.

1398
01:49:52,439 --> 01:49:55,939
I've been on a very good schedule for a long, long time.

1399
01:49:55,939 --> 01:50:08,100
I might just try to just make myself get up in the morning.

1400
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:11,220
I've been so good for the last couple of years,

1401
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:17,569
probably like the last year straight.

1402
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:20,000
What are you gonna do on Sunday or Monday?

1403
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:24,979
Probably switch.

1404
01:50:24,979 --> 01:50:28,060
I might jump into Splatoon 3,

1405
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:29,439
because I was told that the campaign

1406
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:33,140
is actually completely different than the multiplayer game.

1407
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:37,149
I'll play the multiplayer too, whatever.

1408
01:50:37,149 --> 01:50:39,109
It's gonna be a coin flip between Splatoon 3

1409
01:50:39,109 --> 01:50:45,689
and Breath of the Wild on Sunday or Monday.

1410
01:50:45,689 --> 01:50:49,369
What time on Sunday or Monday?

1411
01:50:49,369 --> 01:50:51,090
Probably around the same time,

1412
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:57,350
probably around two specific.

1413
01:50:57,350 --> 01:51:00,279
If you're in the pre-stream, we'll figure it out.

1414
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:02,279
It's either Sunday or tomorrow, whatever,

1415
01:51:02,279 --> 01:51:09,100
Sunday, whatever, or Monday-ish.

1416
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:11,079
Are you gonna play both or just one or the other?

1417
01:51:11,079 --> 01:51:14,319
I have a feeling if I'm gonna play one of those two,

1418
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:17,239
I'm gonna play that for a majority of that stream.

1419
01:51:17,239 --> 01:51:18,800
You don't just play Breath of the Wild

1420
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,680
for an hour and 40 minutes.

1421
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,319
That's, it's the whole day.

1422
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:25,739
That's the stream, right?

1423
01:51:25,739 --> 01:51:34,520
Unless I don't like it, which would be surprising.

1424
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:35,640
It's been long enough.

1425
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:38,760
I know everyone said don't play that

1426
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:42,039
after you play Elden Ring,

1427
01:51:42,039 --> 01:51:44,760
but it's been a long time since Elden Ring came out.

1428
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:48,590
I think it'll be okay.

1429
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:50,470
I hope you don't compare it to Elden Ring.

1430
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:58,529
I don't think so.

1431
01:51:58,569 --> 01:52:04,840
Hey, in two and a half minutes, it'll be 14 hours.

1432
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:06,319
I kinda wanna see the reactions from people

1433
01:52:06,319 --> 01:52:08,359
that just thought this was gonna be a five,

1434
01:52:08,359 --> 01:52:09,640
they probably, you know what?

1435
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:12,840
A lot of people that show up to check out the VOD

1436
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:15,039
will probably think I got addicted to one of these games

1437
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:17,159
and had an absolute meltdown,

1438
01:52:17,159 --> 01:52:28,939
and it was just mayhem for 14 hours.

1439
01:52:28,939 --> 01:52:31,100
You did, you did get addicted.

1440
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:34,479
Oh, that's what happened.

1441
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:40,180
Yeah, but that Oriole game was effectively

1442
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:43,579
one five-hour block of this.

1443
01:52:43,579 --> 01:52:44,579
It wasn't the whole thing.

1444
01:52:44,579 --> 01:52:51,829
I didn't take 14 hours to beat that Oriole game.

1445
01:52:51,829 --> 01:52:53,960
Hey, you know, you can,

1446
01:52:53,960 --> 01:53:03,449
that Oriole game is the reason why I did this 14-hour stream,

1447
01:53:03,449 --> 01:53:07,289
because I knew for a fact if I were to put it down,

1448
01:53:07,289 --> 01:53:09,739
I would not have gone back to it.

1449
01:53:09,739 --> 01:53:12,170
I just wouldn't have, even though I loved it.

1450
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:18,220
Other things would have just gotten priority for stream.

1451
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:20,220
That was the only opportunity to play it and beat it,

1452
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:24,960
unless I did it off stream.

1453
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,680
All right, let's get the, let's roll the end here.

1454
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,750
Thanks, everybody.

1455
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:33,199
I'll see you guys in a day or two.

1456
01:53:33,239 --> 01:53:39,380
I am going to go do some stretches and go lie down.

1457
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:40,579
Have a great night, everybody.

1458
01:53:40,579 --> 01:53:42,819
Thanks for sticking around.

1459
01:53:42,819 --> 01:53:47,119
Hopefully you had a good time.

1460
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:51,000
I definitely have to end it like at 14, zero, zero.

1461
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,319
I don't really care about the seconds,

1462
01:53:52,319 --> 01:53:54,640
but that's a clean 14, right?

1463
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:00,710
14 hours, but that's in 30 seconds.

1464
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:01,789
Good night, guys.

1465
01:54:01,789 --> 01:54:02,609
See you soon.

1466
01:54:02,609 --> 01:54:04,909
Keep an eye on the sus tomorrow and Sunday.

1467
01:54:04,909 --> 01:54:09,470
I'm sure I'll update you a little bit.

1468
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:11,779
Good night, goodbye.

1469
01:54:11,779 --> 01:54:13,039
Take care of yourselves and get some sleep

1470
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:14,819
if you stayed up or good morning.

1471
01:54:14,819 --> 01:54:18,829
Hope you have a good rest of your Saturday.

1472
01:54:18,829 --> 01:54:19,670
See you later.
