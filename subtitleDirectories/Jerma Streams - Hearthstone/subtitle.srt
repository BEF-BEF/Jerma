1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:12,300
Holy shit, Nightbot caught that. I didn't even press the button yet. Nightbot had my tweet come up

2
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:22,149
before it was pushed through to Twitter. That's kind of odd. Hey, but how are you?

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:36,329
How are you? How are you doing? Good. I'm good too. Hearthstone, are you sure about this?

4
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,979
I bet you didn't fucking think you could see this. It's alright. We actually talked last

5
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:52,869
night. Hold on, there's a story here. A long one. This will take about 40 seconds. It's a long

6
00:00:52,869 --> 00:01:07,510
story. Okay, you ready? Just making sure you're ready. The story is, people were making fun

7
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,269
of me last night because of how bad I am at the game. We talked about how Hearthstone I

8
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:16,629
played in bed and they said, you suck. You're so bad. And I was like, fucking, I know.

9
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:28,950
So I figured it'd be fun if you helped me. So that's what we're gonna do. The new expansion

10
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:38,519
came up and chat is going to be my smart click lifeline. This is completely, yeah,

11
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:48,090
this is totally legal backseating. I am at chicken league. I'm going to reach out to

12
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,840
you guys like a bunch of times during games and we're gonna get to rank like 21. That's

13
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,280
all I care about. I just want to get to, I want to get to like rank like 18 or something,

14
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:14,219
or rank like 22. How hard is that? That's, how can you, can I do that in like a couple hours?

15
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,949
And I want, I wanted to, this is a mistake. It's, it's alright though. Cooking Simulator

16
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:32,330
was supposed to be today, but unfortunately I got the release date wrong and it comes

17
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:37,530
up tomorrow. So tomorrow we're going to play Cooking Simulator. I get, I thought it was the 5th,

18
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:44,650
it's the 6th. I swear to God that the release date changed. It was the 5th, I swear,

19
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,219
but whatever. We're doing it tomorrow. I'm streaming tomorrow too. So

20
00:02:52,099 --> 00:03:00,490
it's releasing tomorrow. Cooking Simulator is tomorrow. Tonight is it going to be,

21
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,860
this is, I'm going to just give you a fair warning. I'm not going to start until I give

22
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:13,800
you this complete disclaimer. You are going to get frustrated on this stream. You're going

23
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,439
to be mad at me. You're going to yell at me. You're going to call me names and I'm going to

24
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:36,599
puff my chest out and be like, yeah, right. I'm already mad. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

25
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,009
Here's, I've got smart clicks ready to go. I've got, look at here, I'll show you.

26
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:51,270
Are you ready? Here's Hearthstone. I got $45. I, yes, I did. I know. Oh, he's going to open

27
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:59,689
card packs on stream. He is, he, he's a normie. I know you're going to scream. I know that,

28
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:07,129
I already told you you're going to be mad. I fucking knew it. I told you. I, I saw it.

29
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:13,020
I could smell it. I had to do this because if we're going to make, you guys are going to

30
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:19,819
make me a deck. Look at this. I got Arena 2. You don't think I'm ready to go? You guys

31
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:24,709
are going to pick all this shit and then it's your fault. Don't you understand the long game

32
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:32,649
I'm playing here? I involve chat picking all these cards so then it doesn't matter if I lose.

33
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:42,490
Even if I do bad plays, this is your fault, not mine. You know, a, you got to blame the

34
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,980
tools sometimes. And if you guys are the tools, you know, if you give me a, if you give me

35
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,339
a dull hammer, how am I going to use it? I made a dull sword. How am I going to cut through

36
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:03,639
steel with it? It's not going to happen. All right. And there's also the solo adventure stuff.

37
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:12,740
I'm ready just to play, but a new expansion came out. I've been playing this in bed.

38
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,259
Let's open the fucking packs just because that's what you're here for. And then everyone's going

39
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:25,290
to leave and enable the clicking. Well, not right now. What do you need to enable this

40
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:35,589
for card packs? I got the bundle, which you get 10 of each. I was asking in chat before

41
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:44,339
the stream started how many of these I was going to need. I thought I was saying three,

42
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,370
but I think I need a hundred, but it doesn't matter. We're going to do,

43
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:53,740
we're going to, I already have a lot of fucking cards. Let us click the packs.

44
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,579
No, I'm doing it right now. This is like a big deal for me. I've never done this before

45
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:06,779
on stream. Only 20. Which one do I open first? This one? I'm not going to spend like

46
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:12,139
a fucking hundred dollars on this game. I'm going to get run out of town here. I'm

47
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,180
going to get so embarrassed on this stream. I'm not going to open this again. You think

48
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,379
I'm going to buy like $200 worth of card packs? Here we go. I better get a legendary.

49
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:38,149
I just opened up a card pack and got 25 subs. Holy shit. That's what was in here.

50
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:45,750
KDK945, 20 community subs. I should open more of these. And C4G, thanks for five

51
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:55,939
community subs. No, thank you. That's a lot. Thank you. Here comes a normie stream.

52
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,050
I'm going to put a disclaimer. I'm going to put a disclaimer on the screen.

53
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:06,329
Like here comes a normie stream. No, that's, this is a fun fucking game. I mean the game,

54
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,209
you know, what's happening to me right now. I don't know why this is happening,

55
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,920
but it was. All right. We've got, but seriously guys, thank you so much for the subs.

56
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:25,259
Ooh, look at that. We got blue. Are these good? Oh, I know this is good.

57
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:32,810
I've seen this one played before. A fight. Let me see. That's 20 more community subs.

58
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:47,029
This is just trash. 20 more subs from KDK. This is bad. He goes, hey everyone, let me see.

59
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,550
Oh my fucking God. Everyone's giving so, I should play Hearthstone every day.

60
00:07:52,550 --> 00:08:06,089
That's 50 fucking dollars from Great Canadian. Is it this easy? This can't be this easy.

61
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:13,589
Use it to buy more packs. Thank you Great Canadian for the 50 fucking dollars.

62
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:26,600
Oh, okay. I'm, this is turning into a normie stream. I'm not supposed to be screaming.

63
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:31,779
I'm supposed to shut up today. Thanks for five. Oh, I got five subs out of this one.

64
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:41,580
All right. And I have to be really slow at my card pack opening, right?

65
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,860
Thank you Gnarly for the five subs. This is how you do it, right?

66
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,539
You open up a card pack and you spend like six minutes in here.

67
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:55,850
All right. What's in that one? I don't care what this is. I'm using it.

68
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,899
Do I have to be a shaman? Can we make an all-frog deck?

69
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,450
Can we be first to legendary with an all-toed deck, all-frog deck?

70
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:13,240
What class should I be? Okay, here we go. I'm so, I'm so fucking nervous right now.

71
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,679
My heart rate is like fucking 10,000 beats per second.

72
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:27,690
Captain Hooktusk, summon three pirates from your deck and give them rush.

73
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,279
Is that good? That's pirates. That's not good.

74
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:41,700
I mean, six through eight mana. This seems not very good.

75
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,539
That's not going to be the only legendary. I got 18 packs left.

76
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,830
What's in this one? Besides five community subs.

77
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:01,580
KDK five more subs. Oh my god. No, nothing in here.

78
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,200
I can't, I need to like look at these. Does this even matter?

79
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:18,419
I just, I'm looking for the good cards. Soup?

80
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,539
Soup vendor, whenever you restore three or more health to your hero, draw a card.

81
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:28,090
Priest? Just use a net deck. Ah, that's no fun.

82
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,279
Another 50 fucking dollars came in right now.

83
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,190
Why is the Hearthstone stream already the most profitable stream I've done

84
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,860
in the last like six weeks and it's been live for 12 minutes?

85
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:56,330
What? Ten more community subs. The most profitable.

86
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,009
You guys are too hyped. Why is he doing this?

87
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:06,700
Ow. Ow. I can't laugh. That's 10 more subs. Thank you.

88
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,019
Why is he doing this? There is a reason.

89
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:20,259
Oh, chicken! This thing sucks. How do you overkill something?

90
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:26,460
With one, is it good? This one's all right.

91
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:34,149
He's doing like the Care Bear thing. Oh my god, more subs.

92
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:42,539
Five more subs from KDK. Oh, come on.

93
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:51,340
Five more. What was it? 60? I got two of these now.

94
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,019
That's a shitload, KDK. Thank you so much. That's a lot.

95
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,340
Booty Bay Bookie? Give your opponent a coin. That's not bad.

96
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:09,960
Three, three, two mana. Blood Troll? Five community subs from Soviet.

97
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,519
Thank you. Five, ten, ten community subs.

98
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,820
Opening card packs just gets me subs. 15 subs just came in.

99
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,009
Salad Guy, 10 community subs. Soviet, 19, 21, five community subs.

100
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,440
Come on, no. Epics? KDK, five community subs.

101
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:41,399
Oh my god. I'm telling you, I told you guys to get fucking hyped.

102
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:47,700
What was in that one? Five community subs from Carlos was in this one.

103
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,899
Zoro Carlos, thanks a lot.

104
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,580
Tree Speaker. Transform your treants into five, five ancients.

105
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:10,200
I don't really like Druid. It's a legendary sub.

106
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,899
That looks all right. That's a good card.

107
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,789
Come on, give me another legendary besides that bad one that I got.

108
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,919
Recommend a good whiskey? All right, hack it fast.

109
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,399
Johnny Walker Blue. It's expensive, but it's good.

110
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,840
Or Johnny Walker Black. Johnny Walker Red. Johnny Walker is great, I would say.

111
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,700
Who was this? Destroy? There's eight, man.

112
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,419
Destroy minion costs one less for each minion you control.

113
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:57,509
You guys are gonna have to help me here.

114
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,350
I like have no fucking idea what I'm doing.

115
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:05,129
Grim Rally is good. Destroy friendly minion.

116
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:07,610
Give your minions one, one. All minions? Ever?

117
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,330
Or just like in the hand or on the...

118
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,190
Thank you for the five community subs.

119
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,370
KDK. More community subs.

120
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:26,330
For each pack opened. Oh, I got a double rare here.

121
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,279
Just play Clash of Clans at this point.

122
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,899
No, you guys, we're gonna win. Do you guys understand?

123
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,139
We are going to collectively win this game.

124
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,789
They'll be writing fucking articles about us.

125
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:47,899
About how we came together and we got to rank 21.

126
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:54,090
Together. Scorch.

127
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:01,899
All right, the person that shot the yellow beam hit this person with the beam.

128
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:02,779
Is that what's going on?

129
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:09,639
Oh, we got a new set here.

130
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,600
This is the Amethyst collection.

131
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:19,399
Oh, fuck yeah, dude. Not even 12 packs.

132
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,440
How many community subs did I get out of these?

133
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,200
And there's another legendary.

134
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,659
Ryman, thanks for five community subs.

135
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,379
This is a stacked pack, I'll tell you.

136
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:31,340
Screenshot this one.

137
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,120
Five more subs.

138
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,879
We got a rare epic legend.

139
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:36,519
We got everything.

140
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,419
Five more from Jamie, by the way.

141
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:43,799
Give me a golden legendary in here.

142
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,480
Five more from Utopia Fox.

143
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,919
I can't fucking believe this is happening.

144
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,159
I was like under the assumption.

145
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,600
Okay, here, before I turned the stream on, I was like, I don't know.

146
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,200
Are people gonna like this?

147
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,539
Oh my God.

148
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:04,710
KDK, five more.

149
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,830
Utopia Fox five.

150
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:09,899
I'll be honest, probably not.

151
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,259
But let's see, look, we're just getting piped in the chat.

152
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,460
Hyped.

153
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:14,940
Pumped up.

154
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,720
Golden.

155
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:21,049
Boom Reaver.

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,529
10 community subs from Frisky Moose.

157
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,409
And 50 fucking dollars.

158
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:27,370
What is happening?

159
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:29,210
What did this, what happened?

160
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,409
This 50 just came in.

161
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:31,690
Some guy.

162
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,539
50 dollars.

163
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm broke now.

164
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,039
Don't be broke by giving me that, please.

165
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,039
Don't go broke.

166
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,039

What, is this good?

173
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,980
Summon a copy of a minion in your deck, give it rush.

174
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:02,889
This is a boomer card?

175
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,539
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

176
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,619
This game came out like six years ago.

177
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:06,940
What?

178
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,569
That looks pretty good.

179
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,109
Oh my fucking God, guys.

180
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,990

Golden Rare, mad summoner.

185
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,630
Fill each player's board with imps.

186
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:40,710
Fucking pretty cool.

187
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:46,740
Magic Trip, discover a spell that costs three or less.

188
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,460
That's kind of cool.

189
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:52,730
Not stopping till over three K subs.

190
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,690
Like this stream?

191
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,799
Give me another legendary.

192
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,970
You know what, okay, like 20 community subs.

193
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:10,809
20 community subs in KDK.

194
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,809
Somewhere right now, there is a doctor

195
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,009
who is watching this stream on his lunch break

196
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,329
and he is furious.

197
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:36,099
Somewhere, somewhere, there is like a business owner

198
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,819
that is watching this stream

199
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,059
and he just had to serve like 30 customers

200
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:42,180
and like he's sweating

201
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,779
and like he's got like four employees

202
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:44,819
that really do it.

203
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,099
They got like the bank.

204
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,220
They got to pay their debt down

205
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,420
and then the guy opens up the stream

206
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,660
and I'm making hundreds of dollars

207
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:52,940
opening up card packs.

208
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,000
Somewhere there's a doctor

209
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,200
who just saved somebody's goddamn life

210
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,930
and he's like, what the hell?

211
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,960
I got to get on this opening Hearthstone card packs thing.

212
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,359
Fuck this, I'm quitting being a doctor.

213
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,619
Give him some of your money.

214
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:18,920
No, it's mine.

215
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,720
It's my money.

216
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,400
Sorry.

217
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,279
Fuck, ow.

218
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:22,839
That was weird.

219
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,640
My like head hurts.

220
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,220
Five more community subs, 50 more dollars.

221
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,420
100 fucking dollars.

222
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,099
You fucking kidding me, you guys.

223
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:31,140
What is happening today?

224
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,789
Some of you guys like hit the lottery.

225
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:42,329
It's getting to his head.

226
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:52,779
Uh, 50 dollars for phylactery lich.

227
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:53,420
50 bucks.

228
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,180
The doctor isn't funny though.

229
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm just, I don't know.

230
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,700
I really do appreciate it.

231
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,019
Thank you.

232
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,579
Stream sucks from 1914.

233
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:02,539
Thanks for 50 dollars.

234
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:11,109
I opened him in the wrong order.

235
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,789
I'm fucking delete the stream.

236
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:13,670
I'm never coming back.

237
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:21,259
Shadowy figure, transform into a 2-2 copy.

238
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:21,759
Trash.

239
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,220
Bye, thanks for the stream.

240
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,279
Ooh, another golden.

241
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,660
50 dollars.

242
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,420
Press space bar.

243
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,339
No, because that opens it all immediately.

244
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:43,940
I like to drag it over like it's in my hand.

245
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:48,809
What's a good card?

246
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:51,960
This.

247
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,000
The lackeys are good, right?

248
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,440
Bala koala, 50 dollars.

249
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,480
I've never played Hearthstone.

250
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,279
I just want to fit in.

251
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:14,549
Uh, get like another 50 packs.

252
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:15,349
I'm not doing that.

253
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,009
Boo, boo.

254
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:24,890
Boo, you got to click on the screen and help me win games.

255
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,779
He's gone full normie mode.

256
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:29,660
Alert.

257
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,940
Normie levels are rising.

258
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:41,210
We got to get him to like click on like people puking on YouTube before he gets to normie.

259
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:58,380
This stuff sucks.

260
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,259
Ray of frost.

261
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,039
All right, twin spell.

262
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,039
That means so you can cast it twice.

263
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,839
So twin spell is just echo for spells.

264
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,920
I need a reaction face cam.

265
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,200
No, I'm not doing that.

266
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,039
Ray of frost.

267
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,240
This is this is kind of good.

268
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,880
Freeze a minion.

269
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,720
It's very frozen to one mana.

270
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:19,859
I I'm not.

271
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:20,420
No, I'm not.

272
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,619
I can't put a webcam on.

273
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,710
I physically can't turn it on.

274
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,829
I will get banned from Twitch.

275
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,740
I got three fucking legendaries.

276
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:36,140
I haven't.

277
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,940
Okay, you know what?

278
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,700
This is really has to be waited.

279
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:40,490
You know what I'm saying?

280
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,529
There's no way I haven't like opened.

281
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,009
I haven't bought card packs in probably three to four years.

282
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:46,970
Maybe.

283
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,910
I mean, this has got to be like Diablo three when you didn't play for long enough.

284
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,670
They just gave you legendaries, right?

285
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,140
We go.

286
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,619
Let's play some fucking hype music.

287
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,329
Like, what's that?

288
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:04,250
What's that one that everybody always says to play?

289
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:04,970
Fucking who cares?

290
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,170
Is any good?

291
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,940
Add a copy of each of the battle cry minion.

292
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,329
Now he's turning into a YouTuber.

293
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,619
That's a lot of dust.

294
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:35,220
Five, four, five.

295
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,859
Add a copy of each of the best.

296
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:39,220
The game's gotten so confusing.

297
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:40,660
Battle cry.

298
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,900
Add a copy of each of your battle cry minions to your like.

299
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:48,500
What have I happened to like the two, three alligator and like deal two damage?

300
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:50,900
This is too much for me.

301
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:59,180
That was in 2015.

302
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,240
Double rare.

303
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,180
Destroy minions, summon two minions at the same cost to replace it.

304
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,619
You guys are going to just fucking have to help me here.

305
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:12,099
Look at this one.

306
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,619
Death destroy.

307
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,220
This looks, this is really good.

308
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:19,720
This is like the best card I think I've ever seen.

309
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,059
There's a two, six taunt that when it's destroyed, it kills a random minion.

310
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:26,740
This is like the best card in the whole game.

311
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,799
Is it, am I, is this correct?

312
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,000
Is this the best card in the game?

313
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,200
Because it has to be.

314
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,160
If there are better cards than this, the power creep has gotten too much.

315
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:48,940
Yeah, yeah.

316
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,819
You're asking chat for, of course I'm asking chat for advice

317
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:54,299
because I'm going to be having click maps on this whole time.

318
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,299
And just, we're going to make our arena deck too.

319
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:56,779
Last pack.

320
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,660
Come on, give me your energy.

321
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,700
Give me your energy.

322
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,339
Legendary, legendary, legendary, legendary, legendary.

323
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:20,619
Whenever you play a one cost minion, draw a spell from your deck.

324
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:20,859
Cool.

325
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,299
I don't feel complete though.

326
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:31,430
I like feel like I don't feel, was it connection interrupted?

327
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,789
What the hell did that say?

328
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:34,940
What was that?

329
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:38,980
More packs.

330
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,420
I'm not buying more packs.

331
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:46,230
Try get another pack.

332
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:50,019
How much is one pack?

333
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:50,900
No, no, no, no.

334
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,859
Let me make, hold on.

335
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:54,579
No, I'm not just sitting here and make opening fucking cards.

336
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:58,940
Can't you, you know, you can get packs.

337
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,339
By the way, don't look at this because this is like from 2013.

338
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:09,849
And Boo played like 600 of these games.

339
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,849
Like Boo like played these games for me.

340
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,049
I swear to God, that's for real.

341
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:20,970
See, look, I can get like money.

342
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,980
All right, you guys ready?

343
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,539
We're not doing this yet.

344
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm not, no, Boo's really good.

345
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,779
Boo was like legend.

346
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:31,779
Boo got to legend like at least twice or something.

347
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:32,579
He's really good.

348
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,819
So I have it, I have this queued up.

349
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:39,500
You've been waiting a long time for this.

350
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I know you desperately want to click on the screen.

351
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,940
You want to spam the screen.

352
00:26:45,660 --> 00:27:01,369
It's time for you guys to pick fucking hero back.

353
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,250
Why would I click back?

354
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,210
Those votes are not being counted.

355
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:11,220
Straight from opening decks to building decks.

356
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,119
I got to milk it.

357
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:14,599
You know what I mean?

358
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:20,220
Garrosh is hot.

359
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,980
Like as in he's really good.

360
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:25,900
All right, let's go.

361
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,180
That's by a pretty overwhelming majority at this point.

362
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:41,029
It's going to be warrior.

363
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:45,240
Now what?

364
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,230
See, I'm thinking, I'm thinking,

365
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:50,329
I'm not going to tell you what I think.

366
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,109
Why are you clicking down here?

367
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,549
Stop clicking down here.

368
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:59,430
I'm not going to click this.

369
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm going to refer, this sucks.

370
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,029
This sucked back in 2013.

371
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,069
You don't want to do this.

372
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:14,920
This looks fun.

373
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,220
I'm wrong.

374
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,019
Actually wrong.

375
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:19,339
Okay.

376
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:33,700
If I were me, actually, I don't know.

377
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,740
I don't know what I would do for me.

378
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,079
You guys are too split here.

379
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,279
Don't click this.

380
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,930
This is going to take so long.

381
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:59,930
All right, we're going to, no.

382
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,009
It's going to happen real quick.

383
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,279
Divine shield.

384
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,779
Let's go.

385
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,700
By the way, I'm going to pick the next five cards.

386
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:14,009
Pick right.

387
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:14,569
Wow.

388
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:15,849
28, 28, 28.

389
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:16,730
Holy shit.

390
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:28,089
Gain five armor, draw a card.

391
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:29,049
You guys sure?

392
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:29,529
Are you sure?

393
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:42,339
Shield block?

394
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:42,660
Okay.

395
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,309
Each player gets a two, three weapon and six armor.

396
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:52,789
You're holding a spell that costs five more to four damage.

397
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:56,410
It's a seven, seven dragon.

398
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,940
Don't you have to pay to play in this game mode?

399
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,660
Yes.

400
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,859
Or you just use coins.

401
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,660
All right, we're going to go weapons project.

402
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,900
This is going to take like an hour.

403
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,220
This is going to be worth it.

404
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,309
I click on the pretty cards.

405
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,210
Horse rider?

406
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,380
You know, what about the guy?

407
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,299
Look, you guys aren't going to want to click the guy getting zapped?

408
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,180
Deal.

409
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,819
One damn statement.

410
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:38,099
If it survives, add a lackey.

411
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:38,819
That's awesome.

412
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:43,849
That's so cool.

413
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:47,259
This is boring.

414
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,220
It's just a two, one attack.

415
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,609
Fine.

416
00:30:52,250 --> 00:31:03,660
Another 50 fucking dollars came in.

417
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,660
50 dollars from some guy.

418
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:07,740
Some guy nine.

419
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:13,799
More packs plus doom OST or fucking riot.

420
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,859
Golden force tank.

421
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:16,740
Oh, nice.

422
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,359
I agree.

423
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:27,349
I would have picked that one too.

424
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:28,470
It's riot time.

425
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,869
I'm not doing 50 dollars in card packs.

426
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:33,420
Gain four.

427
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,309
Yep.

428
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,029
Definitely.

429
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:35,829
You guys are smart.

430
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,059
I'm not going to do 50 dollars in card packs.

431
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:45,299
That's going to take like 40 minutes.

432
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:53,910
Oh, it kind of juries out on this one.

433
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,009
Has plus one attack while damage.

434
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:03,269
And then, I mean, always knife juggler, right?

435
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:09,269
All right, we're almost a third of the way there.

436
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:12,920
Okay, I'm going to pick after this,

437
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,279
I'm going to pick the next five cards.

438
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:18,859
And you guys are going to have to work with what I pick because I'm not,

439
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:21,339
this is, this is taking like, no, what do you mean no?

440
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,900
Just open packs until people stop donating.

441
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:32,900
Mechanically, yeah, he's really good.

442
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:35,420
I remember, who told me that?

443
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,059
This one, I don't even need your guy's opinion on this.

444
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,420
It's always this one, right?

445
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:42,819
Always.

446
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,900
Every single time, right?

447
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:53,269
This is the one that goes, and then has like 40 damage, right?

448
00:32:53,829 --> 00:33:00,680
Yeah, I like this one because it's just going like,

449
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,490
see, I just said that, now everyone's clicking on it.

450
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:23,079
Armorsmith, two more seconds.

451
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:31,859
Two, one, okay, come on.

452
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:33,299
Come on, give me a good one.

453
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:34,339
Make me a good deck, guys.

454
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,049
This deck looks awful, by the way.

455
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:44,410
Terrible, you failed.

456
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,539
Oh, look at this one.

457
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:54,660
I had to click that one, look at it.

458
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:15,289
Okay, your turn.

459
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,250
Wow, so cool.

460
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,130
Hearthstone's so cool.

461
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,090
Open more packs.

462
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,650
Dumbass.

463
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,030
All right, this shuffle a bomb into your opponent's deck,

464
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,829
when yeah, this one's cool.

465
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:32,699
You guys are dealing with a toddler right now, you understand?

466
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,059
Like, if I see something that I think is cool,

467
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:35,099
I mean, I'm about to click it.

468
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,880
I'm close to clicking this just because of this.

469
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:44,360
All right, each player gets two, three weapons, six armor.

470
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,159
Each player?

471
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,019
Why would I want to give somebody some six armor

472
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:52,099
and a two, three weapon to the other player?

473
00:34:52,099 --> 00:35:04,039
I don't want to give that person anything so I can destroy them.

474
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,559
I'm not clicking back.

475
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:13,239
We have to make with complete this.

476
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,320
I'm not going to get halfway through and then not do this.

477
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,989
I mean, I'm pretty biased on this one.

478
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,030
This is an original card.

479
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:24,579
Yeah, I agree.

480
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,929
Some of you guys are really smart.

481
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,000
No epics or legendaries or anything?

482
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,519
How many rares have we even seen?

483
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,019
One?

484
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:40,840
These votes are not counted.

485
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,360
Five more community subs from Austin Atlantis.

486
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:47,719
Thank you so much for the five community subs.

487
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,840
Steel?

488
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,389
I thought this was the worst card in the game.

489
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:53,190
Play single player?

490
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,909
I am, don't worry.

491
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,869
This ain't going to be like a two-hour long stream.

492
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:58,230
This is going to be a long one.

493
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,380
This is going to be at least three hours.

494
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,079
I'm kidding.

495
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:04,329
It's going to be like eight.

496
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:04,829
Okay.

497
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,719
Guys, you got to make me the deck first before you do anything.

498
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,840
Hopefully these cards are good.

499
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:18,300
We have too many two and three drops.

500
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,619
My whole deck is going to be two drops.

501
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,929
Give your weapon plus one attack?

502
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,340
Am I going to even beat one person with this?

503
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,760
Two drop OP in Arena.

504
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,559
Is it?

505
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,360
More shield block?

506
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:50,780
Not the like ninja turtle enemy?

507
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:52,489
All right.

508
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:59,110
You have bad two drops.

509
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,780
Do I even have any taunts?

510
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:07,960
No, I don't.

511
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,199
I think this is the only taunt card that's showed up.

512
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:14,409
I have a really bad mana curve.

513
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:19,349
All right, we're getting close.

514
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:20,710
Final ten here.

515
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,699
Mad bomber.

516
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,989
Big clicks coming in on giggling inventor.

517
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,559
This is going to be...

518
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:48,099
I got to weight this one up.

519
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,460
Inventor sucks?

520
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,670
That's okay.

521
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,590
I didn't even look at the mana.

522
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,570
I thought this was like a two or three drop card.

523
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,849
It's seven fucking mana?

524
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:00,969
That's two.

525
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,409
That's kind of not good.

526
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:04,980
It used to be five.

527
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,909
It got nerfed.

528
00:38:09,909 --> 00:38:10,710
Well, here we go.

529
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:19,400
All right.

530
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,599
That's how good it is.

531
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,139
Oh, I see.

532
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,500
Three mana, four, five.

533
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,460
Okay, Jerma.

534
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:28,219
Someone has seven, seven mechanical dragon.

535
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,420
Okay.

536
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:44,099
Anoyotron is like, is the best, all right?

537
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:44,900
I'm about to click it.

538
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,380
Just so I can hear him do his voice line.

539
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,030
Snake Jupiter?

540
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,320
All right, here we go.

541
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:04,579
Oh, yeah.

542
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:08,199
This is the best card in a ring up.

543
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:10,280
Behold the might of storm.

544
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,440
Storm, storm wind.

545
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:14,760
I got it.

546
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,159
Here we go.

547
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,969
You must have to sing when you do these cards.

548
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:34,440
Ah, ah, another zoo.

549
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,820
I got rid of two zoos.

550
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,539
Fine.

551
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:51,260
Who clicked that?

552
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,920
Gain four armor.

553
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,960
Someone ran a four cost minion.

554
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,000
That's pretty good.

555
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,039
I don't have any zero or one drops and I have no late game.

556
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:05,739
Can I get any cards?

557
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,500
I need some like epics and some legendaries.

558
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,780
Two ironforged portals.

559
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,250
Can we make it three ironforged portals?

560
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:18,739
Armorsmith.

561
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:22,900
All right.

562
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,460
Crowd favorite.

563
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,179
Whenever you play a card with battlecry, gain plus one, one.

564
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:30,980
Oh, look.

565
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,860
A one drop.

566
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,449
At least I'll have something to play.

567
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:42,440
All right.

568
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,079
Only two more.

569
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,829
We're almost done.

570
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,409
Rarity does not mean good.

571
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:53,210
Yeah, that's true.

572
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,170
Another one drop.

573
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:54,730
They hurt us.

574
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,679
All right.

575
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:01,880
What do we got?

576
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,909
Omega Devastator.

577
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:09,849
If you have 10 mana crystals, deal 10 damage to a minion.

578
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:11,769
Super Collider.

579
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,650
After you attack a minion, force it to attack one of its neighbors.

580
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:17,909
What?

581
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,960
That's like unfair.

582
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:32,409
All right.

583
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,659
All right.

584
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:39,929
I'm ready.

585
00:41:39,929 --> 00:41:40,730
Let's try one.

586
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,449
Let's try two.

587
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:42,010
Let's go.

588
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:47,019
Are you ready?

589
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:47,980
I'm ready to go.

590
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,579
What do you guys think?

591
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,340
Hold on.

592
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,119
Let me just make sure this is...

593
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,079
Is this working?

594
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:55,639
All right, there we go.

595
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,699
Okay.

596
00:41:57,699 --> 00:41:58,659
All right, let's go.

597
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:02,070
Oh, wait.

598
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,550
It's not on.

599
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,469
Is it on screen?

600
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:07,590
Oh, by the way, for all the stream snipers, get fucked.

601
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:26,980
Get it off.

602
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,019
Oh, shit.

603
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:28,099
What?

604
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:28,659
That's my name.

605
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:29,460
I don't want anybody to see that.

606
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:34,309
I will.

607
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:35,030
All right, here we go.

608
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,150
I don't need any help this game.

609
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,469
Ready?

610
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:37,449
Bang.

611
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:38,489
Hold this.

612
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:53,849
Oh, I got a one drop right off the bat.

613
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:55,050
Cover up your name.

614
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:55,289
Why?

615
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:02,579
Come on.

616
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,219
Come on.

617
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:03,619
Let's go.

618
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,550
Cover your name.

619
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:10,949
Why?

620
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:11,429
What's wrong?

621
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:16,500
People know that's my name.

622
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,159
Oh, he got a legendary.

623
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:20,119
He automatically wins.

624
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:23,739
All right.

625
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,059
So he's got a golden portrait, too.

626
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:27,420
This means that he plays.

627
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:32,389
When does this minion take damage?

628
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,269
Okay, here we go.

629
00:43:33,269 --> 00:43:33,909
Ready?

630
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:39,639
What?

631
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:41,159
I got roped off.

632
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:41,400
What?

633
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,440
Hold on.

634
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,199
I want to get roped.

635
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:45,719
I was like five seconds.

636
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:53,960
That just like hurt me.

637
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:00,940
Oh, what the fuck do I do?

638
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:06,230
The rope is early.

639
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,550
Each player equips two, three weapon and gains six armor.

640
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,349
And then I'm going to hit him.

641
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,210
Pretty good play.

642
00:44:25,769 --> 00:44:31,659
What do you mean order?

643
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:31,900
What?

644
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:40,840
What is this one?

645
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,960
Shuffle the bomb into your opponent's neck.

646
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,480
When drawn, it explodes for five damage.

647
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:47,579
That's not bad.

648
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,760
You're B.M.ing this person.

649
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,320
No, I'm not.

650
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:06,500
What are you talking about?

651
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,659
Add two 4-4 dragons to your hand.

652
00:45:13,909 --> 00:45:14,230
Okay.

653
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,710
Well, you can see.

654
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:16,250
All right.

655
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:16,570
Help me.

656
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,289
What do you want me to do?

657
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:21,269
Quick, quick.

658
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:22,070
I don't have much time.

659
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,670
What are you clicking on?

660
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,980
I don't have much time.

661
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,840
This is not going to work.

662
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,460
Are you serious?

663
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:57,269
There's no way you play the game.

664
00:45:57,269 --> 00:45:58,550
I told you that I was not going to.

665
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,550
I just go back to the single player.

666
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,409
Okay.

667
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:08,760
Actually, I just do this.

668
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,670
I'm just going to portal up.

669
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:14,860
Come on.

670
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,420
That sucks.

671
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:16,860
That sucks.

672
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:29,380
He's just going to kill that right now.

673
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,460
People are coming and expecting good Hearthstone gameplay.

674
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,699
I'm going to have to make a disclaimer.

675
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:38,840
He's got good cards.

676
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,340
All right.

677
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,219
Well, I'm going to kill that.

678
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:44,619
And then I'm going to mad bomber first.

679
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:45,340
Well, now, wait a minute.

680
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,780
Hold on here.

681
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,260
Wait a minute.

682
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:53,210
Hold on here.

683
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,010
Super Collider.

684
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,630
Kill the dragon.

685
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:01,619
Oh, check this shit up.

686
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,400
Hit this.

687
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:09,639
Okay.

688
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:11,079
I'm going to kill this guy.

689
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:11,719
I'm going to hit this guy.

690
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:12,440
I'm going to kill the dragon.

691
00:47:15,219 --> 00:47:15,699
Bingo.

692
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:17,880
Oh, fuck.

693
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,599
I forgot.

694
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:18,840
Okay.

695
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,239
I forgot.

696
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,239
I thought I just did the damage that he...

697
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:30,380
I got it.

698
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,699
What?

699
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,860
I don't have one of those.

700
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:39,989
All right.

701
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:43,260
I'm going to mad bomber and annoy-a-tron.

702
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:48,809
Or I could mechanical whelp and annoy-a-tron.

703
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:49,130
No.

704
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,250
Mad bomber, annoy-a-tron.

705
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:03,449
I just have to last.

706
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,610
I have no draw either.

707
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:10,820
Is this my serious boomer tactics?

708
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,900
Guys, I'm not even going to look at this chat anymore.

709
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:20,389
What do you mean attack him?

710
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:25,820
No.

711
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,219
What?

712
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:27,019
I can...

713
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:29,900
Now I'm going to attack Illidan because he's going to kill two people.

714
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,500
Okay.

715
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,619
Watch this shit.

716
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,460
He's going to kill both these people.

717
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:47,099
Let me see.

718
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:47,900
Divine Charge.

719
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,219
Hold on.

720
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:48,619
I could do...

721
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,980
Wait.

722
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:54,940
It doesn't hit both people?

723
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,019
Force attack one of its neighbors.

724
00:48:57,019 --> 00:48:57,659
Oh, fuck.

725
00:48:57,659 --> 00:48:58,860
Well, here comes the RNG.

726
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,179
Ready?

727
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,500
Check this out.

728
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,539
Left.

729
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:06,940
Left.

730
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:08,139
Yes.

731
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:15,909
Oh, what was that?

732
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:16,389
A secret?

733
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:17,670
Doesn't matter.

734
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:29,670
Okay.

735
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,469
I got to settle down.

736
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:42,260
Guaranteed victory.

737
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:42,739
Guaranteed.

738
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:53,780
No, that's not good.

739
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,300
Your deck sucks and you're bald.

740
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:56,659
All right.

741
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:58,679
Here we go.

742
00:49:58,679 --> 00:49:59,000
Ready?

743
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:01,159
Whack into this guy.

744
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:04,699
They've been kind to me before.

745
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:08,260
They've been kind to me before.

746
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,380
They'll be kind to me again.

747
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:17,429
Let me see.

748
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:18,630
I could go right in the middle here.

749
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,519
I'm not going to rope him.

750
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:47,320
I'm just trying to...

751
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,239
I'm trying.

752
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:49,719
It's like...

753
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,179
Holy shit.

754
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:10,380
I forgot that comes out.

755
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,099
I'm in a good position.

756
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,590
This guy has two legendaries in his fucking deck.

757
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:24,469
Is that even possible?

758
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,940
Oh, get out of here.

759
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,340
I can't...

760
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:41,699
Do I just get rid of these?

761
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:56,570
I'm still all right.

762
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:02,219
I mean, he has more cards, but he's going to melt down?

763
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,780
No, I'm about to freeze up.

764
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:11,449
What are you going to do?

765
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:11,929
What are you going to do?

766
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:12,889
I'm going right...

767
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,889
Better write this down.

768
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:15,619
Don't matter.

769
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:16,420
He's on the ropes.

770
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,219
No, I'm going right to the face.

771
00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:20,219
Oh, yeah.

772
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:20,780
Excuse me.

773
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,260
You got to rush me down here.

774
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:42,739
Hammer the face with one damage?

775
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:43,699
Why would I do that?

776
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,119
This guy's got amazing cards.

777
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:16,570
I'm going to have to hit this.

778
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:19,320
So, I mean...

779
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:21,590
RNG.

780
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,099
Here we go.

781
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:23,820
It's going to hit him.

782
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,099
It's going to do it.

783
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,380
I almost busted that up.

784
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:34,340
All right.

785
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:34,820
Here we go.

786
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:37,289
I need to get people out here.

787
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:43,210
It's not over.

788
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:44,650
I'm going to top deck something.

789
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:50,360
He had two legendaries.

790
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:50,920
Remember that.

791
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,070
Three legendaries.

792
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,510
He had three legendaries.

793
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,670
How do you even get three legendaries in a Reno?

794
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
My whole deck is two drops.

795
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:09,719
It's all right.

796
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:10,199
Here we go.

797
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:10,679
Top deck.

798
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:11,480
That's the best one.

799
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:13,480
You guys got mad at me for picking this.

800
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,940
Give a friendly demon one...

801
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,420
It's over.

802
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:30,469
Concede?

803
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:31,269
I don't concede.

804
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:33,340
They have to earn it.

805
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,210
No, it's well played.

806
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:40,409
Thanks.

807
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:41,980
It's all right.

808
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,099
That was unfair.

809
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:45,769
Unfair.

810
00:54:46,489 --> 00:55:24,420
Here we go.

811
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,460
Your deck sucks.

812
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,070
What am I doing?

813
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:31,829
I'm pretending to click the button so I can avoid stream snipers.

814
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:38,650
All right.

815
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:40,300
This is a better start.

816
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,260
Dump it all.

817
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,219
Does it matter?

818
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:46,019
No, not really.

819
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:47,059
Who cares?

820
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:48,039
Told you to dump it all.

821
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:48,360
Look at that.

822
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,079
I got a good start here.

823
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:52,019
And I get the coin.

824
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,059
Coin Anoyotron.

825
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:54,179
First thing.

826
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:58,489
Coin Anoyotron.

827
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:14,739
Oh, I got a Rager too.

828
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,019
Maybe just delete that from the game.

829
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:17,699
It's like too easy to hurt people.

830
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:18,019
All right.

831
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:18,500
Now look.

832
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,300
We got options here.

833
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,460
All right.

834
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:23,099
So like Anoyotron or Armor Up.

835
00:56:23,659 --> 00:56:29,420
I'm going to say Anoyotron.

836
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:38,340
On the ropes here.

837
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:38,820
What do you got?

838
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:40,659
Draw a mech from your deck.

839
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,920
I think this is a coin Rager opportunity here.

840
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,239
Oh, no.

841
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,440
This is not a coin Rager.

842
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,039
This is a divine shield charge horse rider.

843
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,989
Or it's a Rager.

844
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:52,550
Just get rid of it.

845
00:56:58,389 --> 00:56:59,510
Coin Rager.

846
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:14,500
Did I do that wrong?

847
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:16,969
That was that wrong?

848
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,789
That wasn't wrong, right?

849
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:30,059
Well, what would you do in this scenario?

850
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:30,780
Quick, quickly.

851
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,380
I don't have much time.

852
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,380
I'm not going to click end turn.

853
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,260
All right.

854
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:35,500
Okay.

855
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,699
I see what you guys want me to do.

856
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:37,500
I see it.

857
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:37,980
14%.

858
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,579
18% want me to do.

859
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:40,739
Okay.

860
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:59,219
Got it.

861
00:57:59,219 --> 00:57:59,780
What?

862
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,750
I had to get...

863
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,469
I don't want...

864
00:58:02,469 --> 00:58:03,670
It's a hunter.

865
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:04,789
Hunters have tons of minions.

866
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:07,179
You missed the lethal.

867
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:14,139
Let's go get those card packs.

868
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:15,579
I'm good at that.

869
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:16,619
I'm good at doing that.

870
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:25,369
Well, here's a mech, right?

871
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,409
It's in this...

872
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:28,489
Give a random friendly beast dragon and murloc.

873
00:58:28,489 --> 00:58:28,969
Plus I don't...

874
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:29,289
I only have...

875
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:29,849
I have a beast.

876
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:33,780
Do the weapon here.

877
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:41,829
That's not bad.

878
00:58:51,449 --> 00:58:52,250
Yeah, pretty good.

879
00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,530
You're delaying the stream.

880
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:00,889
What if you're getting stream sniped?

881
00:59:00,889 --> 00:59:01,690
I mean, everybody...

882
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,170
If you...

883
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:02,889
Okay.

884
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:05,369
If you were stream sniping, you watched me build the deck.

885
00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:07,610
So you already know all my cards anyway.

886
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,250
It don't matter.

887
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:17,960
Let's see.

888
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,840
What do I got here?

889
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,880
That's not a bad idea.

890
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,699
Just go for it.

891
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:24,579
Four cost minion.

892
00:59:25,219 --> 00:59:27,829
I think that's what I'm going to do.

893
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:31,460
Come on, something big.

894
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:32,659
That's...

895
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:33,219
All right.

896
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:33,940
I'm okay with that.

897
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,659
That's pretty good.

898
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:58,889
God damn it.

899
00:59:58,889 --> 00:59:59,690
There's the reaper.

900
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:03,619
Reaper.

901
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:04,579
I'm just going to reaper.

902
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,329
Time to reap.

903
01:00:21,769 --> 01:00:22,409
Oh, come on.

904
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:23,690
Three, six.

905
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,639
What is that thing?

906
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:26,920
Your death arrows trigger twice.

907
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:36,230
I think I got to get out the force tank.

908
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,219
No.

909
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:45,289
Taunt and kill the dark iron dwarf.

910
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,059
Taunt and kill the dwarf.

911
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:50,230
And then get some armor.

912
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,500
Hey, it's all right.

913
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:20,699
When you get to 0-2, you play all the other chumps that are 0-2, right?

914
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:35,530
And then they go face with their spells.

915
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:36,250
You are the chump.

916
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,530
I'm not saying I'm not the chump.

917
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:39,050
I'm just saying I'll go up against...

918
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,929
If you're 0-2, we're in the 0-2 chump class.

919
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:46,250
I don't really have any options.

920
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,659
I don't have any options.

921
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,960
Bottom right is the best option.

922
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:13,900
He's thinking.

923
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,579
He's thinking right now.

924
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:16,380
He's not sure what to do.

925
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,059
This thing has been here the whole game.

926
01:02:26,059 --> 01:02:27,739
Well, I can't get rid of it.

927
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:29,420
I don't have any way to get rid of it.

928
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:38,260
Smart click doesn't work because people just click everywhere and it confuses me.

929
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,059
I'm still in this.

930
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,300
Oh, what a godsend.

931
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:54,760
Mad bomber weapons project.

932
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:06,940
Oh, fuck.

933
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:07,980
I can do this.

934
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:08,460
Whatever.

935
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:08,940
Don't matter.

936
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,090
God damn it.

937
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:19,099
I'm going to go 0-3 and then uninstall the game.

938
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:35,239
This is not a meltdown.

939
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:35,880
This is not...

940
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,679
What the fuck?

941
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:50,170
It's not a meltdown unless I say it is.

942
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:53,800
You know, let's just...

943
01:03:55,639 --> 01:04:24,840
He's probably like, holy fuck, I didn't know he had that many.

944
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,519
This deck is not very good.

945
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:27,320
Look at this deck.

946
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,119
What is this deck?

947
01:04:29,769 --> 01:04:32,090
I got three legendaries in the first game.

948
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:34,010
I haven't played this game in like four years.

949
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:36,409
Got three legendaries in the first game.

950
01:04:36,409 --> 01:04:38,650
Second game, I made a little bit of an oops.

951
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:39,530
You know, I did it...

952
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:42,170
I accidentally did a little oops and then it cost me the game.

953
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:42,809
That's what happens.

954
01:04:43,690 --> 01:05:09,900
All right, it's your guys' turn.

955
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,420
You got to pull me out of 0-3 here.

956
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,780
What happened to cooking simulator?

957
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,820
It's not out.

958
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,460
It releases tomorrow.

959
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,500
I got the date wrong.

960
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:35,670
So I was supposed to do that today.

961
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:39,449
Let's just dump everything here.

962
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,059
Add another oopsie to the pile.

963
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,219
All right, it's your turn.

964
01:05:50,219 --> 01:05:51,900
Whatever the highest percentage is, is what I'm doing.

965
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,699
And you got to be quick.

966
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:54,219
And we have one turn for you to figure it out.

967
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:16,179
Okay, go.

968
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:17,380
Nice job.

969
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,420
Nice thinking.

970
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:34,300
Okay, go.

971
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:44,139
Why would you end turn again?

972
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:46,780
No, I'm not going to fucking end turn again.

973
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:52,099
Is that what you were clicking on?

974
01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:53,460
I think that's what you were clicking on.

975
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:54,420
And then you want me to hit, right?

976
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,300
Yes, you do.

977
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:11,880
Funny man bad at card games.

978
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,699
It's just like...

979
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,539
It's just too much for me to have to do.

980
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,300
Like, I can't do this on stream.

981
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,179
I just can't.

982
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:26,340
When I sit there with my fucking mouth open in my bed,

983
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:26,980
it doesn't matter.

984
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,420
I just play whatever I'm going to play.

985
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:29,860
I can't.

986
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:30,500
I'm gonna.

987
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,460
The stream's not over.

988
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,599
You know what?

989
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:36,010
I'm doing this.

990
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:36,889
I'm doing this on my own.

991
01:07:36,889 --> 01:07:37,369
I'm going to win.

992
01:07:38,739 --> 01:07:39,699
I'm not going to look at the chat.

993
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:40,340
Are you ready for this?

994
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:49,909
I'm not going to look.

995
01:07:49,909 --> 01:07:53,190
I know there's going to be people that have dissenting opinions.

996
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:54,789
Oh, I'm going to beat this.

997
01:07:54,789 --> 01:07:55,909
Check this out.

998
01:07:55,909 --> 01:08:03,989
I already got it.

999
01:08:03,989 --> 01:08:04,630
I already know Flynn.

1000
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:40,310
This is a fun game.

1001
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:40,630
It is.

1002
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:49,850
This is just a warm-up game.

1003
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:50,909
All right.

1004
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:35,750
I'm going to be quiet.

1005
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:39,819
See, that's why I did that.

1006
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,340
That's the reason why I did that.

1007
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:44,220
Because now he had to kill that minion on this character.

1008
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,020
That's why I did that.

1009
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:46,779
I need to explain myself.

1010
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:48,300
You guys know the fucking strategies.

1011
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:10,890
But I have seven, seven, four.

1012
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:20,550
No, I can't.

1013
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:22,229
I hate doing this.

1014
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:26,939
I fucking hate attacking and dying into nothing.

1015
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:32,550
It's fine.

1016
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:38,380
And then I can do.

1017
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:39,739
All right.

1018
01:10:39,739 --> 01:10:40,699
I can take care of this.

1019
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:44,600
See, make him do it.

1020
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:51,130
This is bad.

1021
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:51,850
This is not good.

1022
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,079
Gain five armor draw.

1023
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:08,310
I can draw, but this is not going to do anything.

1024
01:11:10,329 --> 01:11:11,850
Just drop every card.

1025
01:11:14,789 --> 01:11:16,310
Worst deck ever.

1026
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:23,340
Oh, damn it.

1027
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,140
I don't have a coin.

1028
01:11:30,729 --> 01:11:31,930
I don't want to put this down.

1029
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,000
Just buy more packs.

1030
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:56,439
Is this arena?

1031
01:11:56,439 --> 01:11:57,560
This is arena.

1032
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,460
This is the first thing I'm playing.

1033
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:04,260
After four years of not playing against another human being in this game,

1034
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:08,340
I decided that I was going to play arena and have Twitch pick the cards

1035
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:11,939
and they gave me fucking shitty cards on purpose for like a joke.

1036
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:27,989
I'm going to go 0-3.

1037
01:12:27,989 --> 01:12:28,949
Fucking on stream.

1038
01:12:28,949 --> 01:12:29,829
I'm going to go 0-3.

1039
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:36,119
I can't go 0-3.

1040
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:36,920
I'm going to go 0-3.

1041
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,399
No, I'm not.

1042
01:12:48,659 --> 01:12:49,300
It's not bad.

1043
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,140
And then Berserker.

1044
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:08,840
Damn it.

1045
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,810
Right when I have an opportunity to like pull this back.

1046
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:17,510
Does this deck just suck or am I like

1047
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,270
the stupidest Hearthstone player on Twitch?

1048
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,699
I can't go 0-3.

1049
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:46,010
No, it can't start like this.

1050
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:49,930
I'm just going to go play with the funny cards in single player mode.

1051
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,539
Nothing even matters.

1052
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,079
Whatever.

1053
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:13,239
Thanks for the extra damage.

1054
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:14,359
It's not going to do anything for me.

1055
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:17,239
I don't even need to do that.

1056
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:22,920
I'm just going to go to the funny cards after this.

1057
01:14:33,739 --> 01:14:35,739
I got like the extension for this.

1058
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,909
Let's go.

1059
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:44,060
No, it's because it's because we got bad calls.

1060
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,979
We got bad draw from the arena choice.

1061
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:57,029
We went to arena first.

1062
01:14:57,029 --> 01:14:58,949
Don't let the sour your opinion of me.

1063
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:46,840
Nice.

1064
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:53,779
Do you even get a key or do they send you like home?

1065
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:56,899
Do they send you home with like a needs improvement?

1066
01:15:56,899 --> 01:15:59,220
Have your parents sign the report card?

1067
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,569
Piece of paper.

1068
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,220
Oh, I got a card pack out of that.

1069
01:16:19,029 --> 01:16:19,430
Nice.

1070
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:24,579
Come on, give me something like pity legendaries.

1071
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:31,189
Two rares.

1072
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:39,750
Well, let's start with arena.

1073
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,670
I shouldn't have started with arena.

1074
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,750
Arena is like people are very good at it.

1075
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:47,189
They play it and they one of those guys had the gold characters,

1076
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:49,270
which means he has like 5,000 wins.

1077
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:54,739
I didn't even look at the cards that I opened.

1078
01:17:02,199 --> 01:17:03,720
I played these are fun.

1079
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,600
I've done these already.

1080
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:11,420
I'm going to do the solo thing.

1081
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,489
See, I've been doing this.

1082
01:17:14,489 --> 01:17:19,270
It's fun because this you don't have to pay cards.

1083
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:20,550
They just do it for you.

1084
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:23,449
It's great.

1085
01:17:23,449 --> 01:17:25,609
Heroic or I can't do heroic.

1086
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,260
Heroic.

1087
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:33,979
I can't do that.

1088
01:17:43,289 --> 01:17:43,930
Baby mode.

1089
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:48,250
Let me just see if I have the confidence to be able to play this game.

1090
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,689
I've already done it a bunch.

1091
01:17:49,689 --> 01:17:51,829
I'll let you pick this.

1092
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:54,550
If you don't know what this is, it's a lot of fun.

1093
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:54,949
Okay.

1094
01:17:54,949 --> 01:17:57,189
I started with arena and what a mistake that was.

1095
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:59,510
Who should I play?

1096
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:04,619
I got to build my confidence back up.

1097
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:11,770
I hate fun.

1098
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,960
Oh, also another funny little tidbit here of information.

1099
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:27,350
You know how I said that cooking simulator launches tomorrow.

1100
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,550
I thought it launched today.

1101
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:35,130
Well, I was under the assumption that the new week was today,

1102
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:42,250
but that's also apparently tomorrow too.

1103
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:47,770
I thought this was going to be open today.

1104
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:53,130
It's tomorrow.

1105
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:54,170
Week four is tomorrow.

1106
01:18:56,789 --> 01:18:59,430
Yeah, fourth week of like the new part of the adventure.

1107
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:01,850
We're going to do rogue.

1108
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:09,239
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.

1109
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:10,439
You're going to do an early stream.

1110
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:14,619
No, I'm doing cooking simulator tomorrow.

1111
01:19:14,619 --> 01:19:20,569
Because I've fucking beaten 19 people.

1112
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,560
See, I've done this.

1113
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:24,840
This is my number.

1114
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:28,659
All right, which one?

1115
01:19:28,659 --> 01:19:32,260
The dagger, the random card from another class,

1116
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,939
or two damage to an undamaged minion.

1117
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,880
You've only done 19.

1118
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,960
Don't be mean to me.

1119
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:40,920
I just play this in bed.

1120
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:45,239
Okay, we'll do that one.

1121
01:19:48,329 --> 01:19:54,250
And which deck would you like to do?

1122
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,369
We don't have to pick on this one.

1123
01:19:56,729 --> 01:20:05,750
Random, a random deck.

1124
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:13,020
All right, that's the way it's going to be.

1125
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:15,829
Let's go.

1126
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:21,430
So it's kind of like a rogue-like.

1127
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,430
You start at the beginning and you fight bosses.

1128
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:24,949
It's eight bosses.

1129
01:20:24,949 --> 01:20:26,390
If they go down, you complete the run.

1130
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:27,430
If you don't, if you lose,

1131
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:28,789
you have to go back to the very beginning.

1132
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,720
You get upgrades along the...

1133
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,539
Fine, we'll just go.

1134
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,140
For a second, I was about to play this,

1135
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,539
but nobody can scream snipe me.

1136
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:01,380
You know, okay, I'll give you...

1137
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,979
If I was in bed right now, this would be...

1138
01:21:04,979 --> 01:21:05,779
I wouldn't even mind.

1139
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:06,579
It doesn't matter.

1140
01:21:06,579 --> 01:21:07,140
I would just be like,

1141
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,260
oh, I want to shoot this thing.

1142
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:09,380
I want to play with this one.

1143
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:18,170
There are 3,600 people in my bed and I don't like it.

1144
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:22,010
You know, I feel like this is my bedtime thing.

1145
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:28,710
All right, so every single

1146
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:34,579
turn, we're going to do a, you know,

1147
01:21:35,779 --> 01:21:36,579
equivalent exchange.

1148
01:21:36,579 --> 01:21:38,500
Swap a random card in each player's hand.

1149
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,619
This is just clown shit.

1150
01:21:39,619 --> 01:21:40,260
It doesn't matter.

1151
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,060
So who cares?

1152
01:21:48,149 --> 01:21:50,149
See, like this is just clown shit.

1153
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:51,029
It doesn't matter.

1154
01:21:51,029 --> 01:21:53,430
Nobody can like say it was a bad move

1155
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:54,229
because like that was...

1156
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:56,149
What am I supposed to do about that?

1157
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:56,869
I can't stop that.

1158
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:01,880
Draw a card that has Deathrattle cast.

1159
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,600
This again.

1160
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,520
I don't think I even have any Deathrattle cards.

1161
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,479
Let's just steal something.

1162
01:22:07,619 --> 01:22:10,739
See, look, it's a total just dog shit mode.

1163
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:12,710
I'm not supposed to have this.

1164
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:21,289
Click the funny sound buttons.

1165
01:22:21,289 --> 01:22:21,529
Okay.

1166
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:33,079
I don't have any Deathrattle cards.

1167
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:33,399
We need to...

1168
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:34,760
Okay, we need to pick Deathrattle cards

1169
01:22:35,319 --> 01:22:36,359
because they can't even attack.

1170
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,270
I'm just gonna steal another card.

1171
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:39,750
What does this do?

1172
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:41,850
Four health to each hero.

1173
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,710
I don't have any silences either.

1174
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:49,180
Give me another one.

1175
01:22:51,449 --> 01:22:53,850
Give all dragons into our hand.

1176
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:54,569
Three, three.

1177
01:23:02,569 --> 01:23:07,739
If I had a dragon, that'd be fucking incredible.

1178
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:12,500
All right, let's get some board here.

1179
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:15,720
Just to get it out there.

1180
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,600
I mean, it can't attack

1181
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,560
but the computer's stupid

1182
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,239
so the computer will probably like attack it.

1183
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:21,189
And there's the shark.

1184
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:23,239
Eat a minion in your deck

1185
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:24,279
and it gains its stats.

1186
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:25,640
Add it to your hand if it dies.

1187
01:23:32,949 --> 01:23:35,590
Look, the computer is like as dumb as me.

1188
01:23:37,909 --> 01:23:43,800
Pack opening.

1189
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,520
Waiting room.

1190
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,180
All right, we got some cool here.

1191
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:55,180
Uh, this deck is so bad.

1192
01:23:55,819 --> 01:23:56,939
Deal two damage.

1193
01:23:56,939 --> 01:23:58,939
Give your C'Thun to...

1194
01:23:58,939 --> 01:24:00,939
I don't even fucking have a C'Thun.

1195
01:24:00,939 --> 01:24:07,319
I think I should put out the...

1196
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,159
Add a random potion to your hand.

1197
01:24:11,659 --> 01:24:13,020
Lethal, I can't attack with this.

1198
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,930
Deal five damage to all characters.

1199
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:24,069
Well, let's just do...

1200
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:33,560
Minus three attack this turn.

1201
01:24:35,369 --> 01:24:36,170
I just did that.

1202
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:41,130
All right, now we're gonna do shark.

1203
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:46,630
Five damage to all characters.

1204
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:47,350
No, I don't wanna do that.

1205
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,300
Deal one damage to all other minions.

1206
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:53,060
I mean, I think I'm gonna do shark.

1207
01:24:57,109 --> 01:24:57,909
No, let's do shark.

1208
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:06,170
I don't have any more minions.

1209
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,770
I only have one card.

1210
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,020
Fucking God.

1211
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,380
All right, it's time to win.

1212
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:31,420
So that's five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1213
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:33,859
I win.

1214
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,189
I beat level one on normal.

1215
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:49,850
Okay.

1216
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:51,050
What treasure do you want me to pick?

1217
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:54,010
Should I pick, like, give me advice?

1218
01:25:55,689 --> 01:25:56,810
Don't click that one.

1219
01:25:58,010 --> 01:25:59,449
That one is so stupid.

1220
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:00,170
Don't do that.

1221
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:06,149
No, no, no, no, no.

1222
01:26:06,149 --> 01:26:07,510
I'm gonna lose in the last...

1223
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:08,789
If I get far enough.

1224
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,609
Look at how good these other ones are.

1225
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,680
All right, I need to...

1226
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,560
What box?

1227
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,159
What creature box am I gonna do?

1228
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:31,659
I don't even...

1229
01:26:31,659 --> 01:26:32,140
What the hell?

1230
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:32,539
What are we...

1231
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:36,890
It's such a random amount of cards.

1232
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:39,210
It actually just truly is random nonsense.

1233
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:42,170
Cold blood three times.

1234
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:52,090
These guys are just trying to give it a lose.

1235
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,579
Four, I guess, like...

1236
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,180
Four, eight...

1237
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:04,739
Do you have a weapon?

1238
01:27:04,739 --> 01:27:05,859
I don't even think I have a weapon.

1239
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,949
All right, coming up next is...

1240
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,560
What?

1241
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:21,430
We have to do...

1242
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:22,550
We have to fight Wendy again.

1243
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:30,189
Uh-huh.

1244
01:27:34,409 --> 01:27:36,010
This is the same thing?

1245
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:36,409
It's the same...

1246
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:40,649
Oh, no.

1247
01:27:41,609 --> 01:27:44,340
Uh, yeah.

1248
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,460
Game one, one for each other.

1249
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,020
Pirate yet?

1250
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:47,539
Well, I don't have any other pirates.

1251
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,140
Oh, Wendy stream sniped me.

1252
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:56,550
All right, give helpful advice.

1253
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:00,880
What?

1254
01:28:03,989 --> 01:28:05,270
Wait, why did I just get these?

1255
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:06,149
That's not advice.

1256
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:06,949
That's cheating.

1257
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:19,640
Cheating is advice.

1258
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,359
No, it's not.

1259
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:21,399
How many of these do I...

1260
01:28:21,399 --> 01:28:23,000
I can't even play these.

1261
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,560
I have to, like, get a fucking minion out here.

1262
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:40,100
Well, I'll be able to do all kinds of fun stuff.

1263
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:43,300
Divine Shield, draw a card.

1264
01:28:46,899 --> 01:28:50,739
I mean, should I just give him a fucking shitload?

1265
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:53,060
I think I'm going to do Divine Shield,

1266
01:28:54,279 --> 01:28:58,180
or should I do Prep and then...

1267
01:29:00,489 --> 01:29:02,329
Prep double cold blood.

1268
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:20,949
See, this is what...

1269
01:29:20,949 --> 01:29:21,350
This is...

1270
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:21,989
I like this.

1271
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:25,319
No pressure.

1272
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,199
No stream snipers.

1273
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:33,319
Um, I don't fucking have deathrattle.

1274
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:34,199
Yes, I do, I guess.

1275
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:39,579
Yeah, beat it.

1276
01:29:39,579 --> 01:29:46,090
Restore 12 health through a friendly character.

1277
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,960
This is our town, Scruff.

1278
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,000
Yeah, beat it.

1279
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:54,520
I'm sure...

1280
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,399
Okay, if you could...

1281
01:29:55,399 --> 01:29:56,680
If you could friendly fire,

1282
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,119
I would have just killed myself.

1283
01:30:00,329 --> 01:30:01,130
Deal one day and hold...

1284
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:01,770
Let me look at these.

1285
01:30:03,289 --> 01:30:06,380
Divine Shield, magnetic rush.

1286
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:06,859
Let me see.

1287
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:07,659
What do we got here?

1288
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:26,760
Didn't even need anybody's help.

1289
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:29,180
Yes, I'm a newbie.

1290
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:29,579
I know that.

1291
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:32,630
I'm aware of that.

1292
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:33,909
I'm so fucking good.

1293
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,560
All right, pick a box.

1294
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:42,729
You're doing really good.

1295
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:43,850
Carried by Khadgar.

1296
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:44,329
That's fine.

1297
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,100
More combo.

1298
01:30:47,899 --> 01:30:56,680
Deal two damage.

1299
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,880
Summon a Jade Golem.

1300
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:58,920
An evil miscrant.

1301
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,279
Add two random lackeys.

1302
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,319
All right.

1303
01:31:02,119 --> 01:31:02,920
Who's next?

1304
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:08,949
Soothe saver Zoe.

1305
01:31:08,949 --> 01:31:09,670
At the start of your turn,

1306
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:11,750
restore two health to all friendly minions.

1307
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:15,029
That's fucking insane.

1308
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,020
How are we ever going to be able to beat this?

1309
01:31:18,899 --> 01:31:28,220
Did you just mute Dr. Boom?

1310
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,260
That's not Dr. Boom.

1311
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:41,029
All right, I want...

1312
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:43,270
I mean, that's...

1313
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:44,470
Two damage is two damage.

1314
01:31:45,109 --> 01:31:46,869
By the way, if you're curious,

1315
01:31:46,869 --> 01:31:49,750
everybody's attack and health have swapped.

1316
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:50,789
You probably already knew that.

1317
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:54,739
Let me keep this.

1318
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:01,979
All right, Khadgar.

1319
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:03,100
Give me some more free shit.

1320
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:09,340
Is there any circumstance

1321
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:15,989
where you would ever play this card?

1322
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:17,029
Yes, there is.

1323
01:32:17,029 --> 01:32:19,109
What the fuck is the scenario?

1324
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:22,310
Draw the rest of your deck.

1325
01:32:23,109 --> 01:32:25,829
Let me adjust the cost of that for you.

1326
01:32:25,829 --> 01:32:29,979
I mean, that didn't really help, but thanks.

1327
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,739
Silver hand recruit you control.

1328
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:44,199
If you have an empty hand and 10 cards left.

1329
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:44,840
Yeah, I guess.

1330
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,319
I guess it is just a huge draw,

1331
01:32:47,319 --> 01:32:51,130
but so many crazy things that they've added.

1332
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:55,050
Well, here's the two damage.

1333
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,060
Causes zero.

1334
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,020
Okay, what do we got?

1335
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:07,979
I got some damage here.

1336
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,460
Deal two damage.

1337
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:13,430
Oh, no, I can't do that.

1338
01:33:14,069 --> 01:33:15,050
I could do...

1339
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:18,279
I could do this.

1340
01:33:18,279 --> 01:33:18,680
I could do...

1341
01:33:19,399 --> 01:33:20,199
What's more important?

1342
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:24,439
Oh, I don't know.

1343
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:25,159
What's more important?

1344
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,920
This is all combos.

1345
01:33:29,989 --> 01:33:36,310
Two damage into bandit into hit or two damage into...

1346
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:50,359
That works.

1347
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,960
One into two into three into one into two.

1348
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,319
How many fingers do you see?

1349
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:04,569
Oh, I hate combo cards.

1350
01:34:05,689 --> 01:34:06,489
Because I like...

1351
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:07,850
It's too many...

1352
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,210
It's too many problems to deal with.

1353
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:10,409
It's too many, like, chains.

1354
01:34:11,289 --> 01:34:14,039
All right, so that's two, three, four.

1355
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:18,420
Or we could do two and then three.

1356
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,739
It could be you.

1357
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:22,460
It's going to be you.

1358
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:25,399
I'm not going to draw my whole deck.

1359
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:28,310
Here's what we're going to do.

1360
01:34:29,319 --> 01:34:29,819
You ready?

1361
01:34:44,789 --> 01:34:50,069
Add a toxin to your hand.

1362
01:34:50,069 --> 01:34:50,569
Nice.

1363
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:57,880
Plus one attack and rush.

1364
01:34:58,279 --> 01:34:59,239
Discover a spell.

1365
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:04,260
Now you draw a card and then...

1366
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:09,539
I got three draw.

1367
01:35:09,539 --> 01:35:11,060
I'm not going to draw the rest of the deck.

1368
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:13,210
That's going to kill me.

1369
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:15,770
I'm going to start taking fatigue damage.

1370
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:19,670
One attack, let's say it will be...

1371
01:35:22,819 --> 01:35:23,779
Here's what I'm going to do.

1372
01:36:00,329 --> 01:36:01,130
Oh, that's nice.

1373
01:36:04,869 --> 01:36:06,229
You shouldn't have cleared.

1374
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:07,029
Well, that was scary.

1375
01:36:07,989 --> 01:36:08,630
Okay, now he's...

1376
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:09,829
Look, what are you going to do?

1377
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:14,329
This is...

1378
01:36:14,329 --> 01:36:15,130
I can take care of this.

1379
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:23,819
Set the attack of all minions to one.

1380
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:24,539
Preparation.

1381
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:26,229
Find shield.

1382
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:27,670
Let's see.

1383
01:36:29,609 --> 01:36:31,449
So everyone has one attack.

1384
01:36:31,449 --> 01:36:32,250
And that's not going to help.

1385
01:36:35,029 --> 01:36:36,789
Prep and draw the deck.

1386
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:40,949
Are you happy?

1387
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:42,409
Are you happy?

1388
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:46,869
Do I have lethal?

1389
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,880
Hold on.

1390
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,569
That's four, eight.

1391
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:58,220
Cold blood.

1392
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:05,500
So let me see.

1393
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:05,819
Hold on.

1394
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:07,659
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1395
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:10,460
Do I have lethal?

1396
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:15,449
Eight, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty...

1397
01:37:15,449 --> 01:37:16,010
I got lethal.

1398
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:25,430
Holy shit, a ton of subs just came in.

1399
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:26,390
I don't have lethal!

1400
01:37:27,029 --> 01:37:31,829
Why did I just think I had lethal?

1401
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:39,850
Why did somebody tell me I had lethal?

1402
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,449
I'm not supposed to be looking at the chat room.

1403
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:47,220
Oh, god damn it.

1404
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:48,020
It's all right, I'm going to win.

1405
01:37:48,659 --> 01:37:51,619
Uh, twenty community subs just came in.

1406
01:37:53,479 --> 01:37:55,479
Thank you for the twenty community subs.

1407
01:37:55,479 --> 01:37:57,159
Great Canadian fuck club.

1408
01:37:58,779 --> 01:37:59,500
Thank you so much.

1409
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:04,710
Oh, no.

1410
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:10,010
Oh, this is perfect.

1411
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:30,260
What are you gonna do about that?

1412
01:38:30,979 --> 01:38:41,270
Ow!

1413
01:38:53,819 --> 01:38:55,899
Big brain, big brain, big brain.

1414
01:39:05,699 --> 01:39:08,039
Oh, nice card you got.

1415
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:14,520
I've never played this game before.

1416
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,880
I have no idea what the fuck is happening.

1417
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:21,270
Well, I can probably join that boat with you.

1418
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:24,470
But anyways, the great Canadian brick club Cersei gave.

1419
01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:25,270
That's a lot of money.

1420
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:27,270
Thank you for the twenty community subs.

1421
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:32,630
There was also fifty dollars earlier from Toxray.

1422
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:34,789
Thank you for the fifty fucking dollars.

1423
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:38,310
And they said, play against Stirr at least once.

1424
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:39,909
No, he plays this game all the time.

1425
01:39:39,909 --> 01:39:40,630
That would be a mistake.

1426
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:42,069
Which one?

1427
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:51,060
Master Scheme Super Simeon Sphere and Flyby.

1428
01:39:56,279 --> 01:39:58,680
Shuffle a Kaboom bot into your opponent's deck when joined.

1429
01:39:58,680 --> 01:39:59,560
It explodes for a fit.

1430
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,000
So you just instantly kill somebody.

1431
01:40:08,149 --> 01:40:09,909
If they draw that, you just win.

1432
01:40:09,909 --> 01:40:13,399
That seems, I mean, that seems pretty cool.

1433
01:40:15,939 --> 01:40:16,500
This is cool.

1434
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:17,300
Summon King Moogle.

1435
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,699
I give it immune and can't be targeted by spells and hero powers.

1436
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:26,460
Seems like the indecisive some of you guys.

1437
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:35,430
But gonna have to click on the one that has the most votes.

1438
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:43,289
What just happened?

1439
01:40:44,619 --> 01:40:45,579
Oh, God damn it.

1440
01:40:45,579 --> 01:40:46,699
We have to do this again.

1441
01:40:46,699 --> 01:40:48,539
For some reason, it reset itself.

1442
01:40:49,979 --> 01:40:51,739
Anybody could click it an infinite amount of times.

1443
01:40:51,739 --> 01:40:52,460
You ready?

1444
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:53,420
Here it comes.

1445
01:40:53,420 --> 01:41:00,600
This one's for real.

1446
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,319
I looked over, there was like ten thousand clicks.

1447
01:41:03,319 --> 01:41:15,689
People were just like, maybe I'll press that.

1448
01:41:15,689 --> 01:41:17,670
Maybe I'll press this one.

1449
01:41:18,789 --> 01:41:22,550
Super Simeon Sphere is looks like it's gonna win.

1450
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:32,180
That is the one you get.

1451
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:33,140
Don't worry, don't go anywhere.

1452
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:33,859
You get to pick again.

1453
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,880
I don't want more combo card.

1454
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:56,949
There's like a legendary over here.

1455
01:41:56,949 --> 01:42:09,300
How many cold bloods am I gonna have?

1456
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,020
All right.

1457
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:14,659
Eviscerate, cold blood, and then Vile Spine slowly destroy a minion for combo.

1458
01:42:14,659 --> 01:42:15,539
I guess we can take it.

1459
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:20,470
Oh, this is this thing, right?

1460
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:23,210
So this is a friendly encounter.

1461
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:25,449
We get to pick something or change something.

1462
01:42:25,449 --> 01:42:26,409
You guys can pick this too.

1463
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:35,539
You get to modify the deck.

1464
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:36,500
Let's see.

1465
01:42:43,829 --> 01:42:44,630
All right.

1466
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:52,460
So we got the shark, the Disciple of C'thun, the skater bot, and the Vile Spine.

1467
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:55,539
And then these up here.

1468
01:42:55,539 --> 01:42:59,779
Lotus Agents, Malygos, and Lower Walker Cho.

1469
01:42:59,779 --> 01:43:03,979
Choose a friendly minion that always starts in your hand.

1470
01:43:03,979 --> 01:43:06,220
So I can get one of these to always be in the hand.

1471
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:08,060
Discover a legendary and add it to the deck.

1472
01:43:08,619 --> 01:43:13,979
Or look at four spells from your deck and reduce the cost by one of their cost by three for the whole run.

1473
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:23,189
Always have the shark or all add everybody and give them all one one.

1474
01:43:23,189 --> 01:43:27,779
Which one do you want me to do?

1475
01:43:27,779 --> 01:43:29,619
I can do two of these.

1476
01:43:29,619 --> 01:43:30,819
Well, the ones that cost.

1477
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:34,890
I don't think this is going to work without a zoom in.

1478
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:42,340
Yeah, I don't think this is going to work without me zooming in.

1479
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,000
Hold on just a second here.

1480
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:56,409
Try it again.

1481
01:44:06,359 --> 01:44:17,479
Add all or choose a friendly minion and remove it from the deck.

1482
01:44:17,479 --> 01:44:18,600
Looks like we're going to do this one.

1483
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:24,260
Add all these enemy minions and give them all plus one plus one.

1484
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:29,210
Here we go.

1485
01:44:34,229 --> 01:44:34,550
Okay.

1486
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:43,159
Now what?

1487
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:43,960
What should I do now?

1488
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:52,779
Discover a legendary.

1489
01:44:52,779 --> 01:44:55,079
People want me to get rid of...

1490
01:44:55,079 --> 01:44:56,359
What do you want me to get rid of?

1491
01:45:01,210 --> 01:45:02,250
Let's discover a legendary.

1492
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:03,529
I mean, everyone's going to want me to do that.

1493
01:45:03,529 --> 01:45:03,930
Of course.

1494
01:45:04,979 --> 01:45:05,300
Why?

1495
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:06,500
You know, why the heck not?

1496
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,500
Well, you can't go wrong with that one.

1497
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,460
They're a regular.

1498
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:10,149
Okay.

1499
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:11,670
Let's zoom out for a second.

1500
01:45:16,329 --> 01:45:17,289
Can you zoom out, please?

1501
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:26,170
Tack, gnaws, whisker, ysera, or mogre the ogre.

1502
01:45:31,989 --> 01:45:33,829
Mogre the ogre is terrible.

1503
01:45:40,699 --> 01:45:42,460
Nobody wants tack.

1504
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:48,220
Not one person.

1505
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:49,739
All right, ysera.

1506
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,300
Anything else you guys would like me to do or is time to end?

1507
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:58,810
Remember, if you click down there,

1508
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:06,680
there's only one thing I can do.

1509
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:07,399
Dismiss.

1510
01:46:07,399 --> 01:46:08,439
All right.

1511
01:46:08,439 --> 01:46:08,920
Dismiss?

1512
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,979
Who would you like me to dismiss?

1513
01:46:11,979 --> 01:46:18,739
Thank you, Dora.

1514
01:46:18,739 --> 01:46:19,539
Oh, fuck.

1515
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:21,590
Hold on.

1516
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:22,069
Hold on.

1517
01:46:22,069 --> 01:46:22,390
No.

1518
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:22,869
Oops.

1519
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:40,220
Do it again.

1520
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,340
Skaterbot.

1521
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:42,779
Disciple Cthulhu and the shark.

1522
01:46:42,779 --> 01:46:43,659
Dismiss the shark.

1523
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:46,420
Skaterbot.

1524
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:46,819
Okay.

1525
01:46:46,819 --> 01:46:47,539
Interesting choice.

1526
01:46:47,539 --> 01:46:48,500
Interesting choice.

1527
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,260
I'm not sure I would have done that.

1528
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:53,180
Get him out of here.

1529
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:55,159
Let's go.

1530
01:46:55,159 --> 01:47:01,449
That's what you say, Jerma.

1531
01:47:01,449 --> 01:47:03,050
That's why you're chicken league.

1532
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:07,220
But you can't stay here.

1533
01:47:07,939 --> 01:47:09,380
Because you suck.

1534
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:11,210
But it's still fun.

1535
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:15,479
Okay, so this lady.

1536
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:18,439
Both players summon a minion from their deck and they fight.

1537
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,810
Pretty cool.

1538
01:47:21,449 --> 01:47:27,159
Why are we trying to win?

1539
01:47:29,939 --> 01:47:31,619
I don't know, because sometimes winning is fun.

1540
01:47:37,659 --> 01:47:39,180
I do have both of those dragons.

1541
01:47:40,939 --> 01:47:42,779
13-5 because they're swapped.

1542
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,260
You can't hold them, ysera.

1543
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:47,979
No, that's not how it goes.

1544
01:47:47,979 --> 01:47:49,739
You can't hold on to a nine cost.

1545
01:47:49,739 --> 01:47:51,100
You gotta get somebody in here.

1546
01:47:53,819 --> 01:47:54,300
No, I can't.

1547
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,500
I gotta get rid of...

1548
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,779
No, I can't do that.

1549
01:47:56,779 --> 01:47:57,579
Not this early.

1550
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:59,579
I need, like, a minion.

1551
01:48:03,449 --> 01:48:04,489
Hold it or die.

1552
01:48:05,449 --> 01:48:06,010
Wow.

1553
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:06,729
That was...

1554
01:48:06,729 --> 01:48:07,289
There we go.

1555
01:48:07,289 --> 01:48:07,930
There's Cho.

1556
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:18,409
Immediately play Cho.

1557
01:48:18,409 --> 01:48:20,810
A 5-1 Lorewalker Cho.

1558
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,279
Thank god I did the 1-1.

1559
01:48:24,279 --> 01:48:25,479
Otherwise he would just be dead.

1560
01:48:25,479 --> 01:48:26,359
He wouldn't be able to play him.

1561
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:33,819
Perfect.

1562
01:48:33,819 --> 01:48:34,220
Let's go.

1563
01:48:35,819 --> 01:48:41,859
I'll take it.

1564
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,420
He's immediately dead.

1565
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:54,710
Okay.

1566
01:48:54,710 --> 01:48:56,869
So, um, I could do that to him.

1567
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:02,359
Or I could do...

1568
01:49:03,239 --> 01:49:08,470
Maybe I should just put out...

1569
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:08,710
No.

1570
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:12,569
Just combo, eviscerate.

1571
01:49:14,579 --> 01:49:15,140
I could just...

1572
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:16,659
Yeah, I could.

1573
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:20,890
Yeah, fuck it.

1574
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:21,130
Wait.

1575
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:22,420
Yeah.

1576
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:25,689
Check this out.

1577
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:38,149
What the hell was that?

1578
01:49:42,229 --> 01:49:43,029
What just happened?

1579
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,039
She played her thing in two...

1580
01:49:46,039 --> 01:49:46,279
Okay.

1581
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:50,140
Oh, deal three damage to all minions is the thing that plays.

1582
01:49:50,779 --> 01:49:53,020
Okay, that was all over the place.

1583
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:53,340
All right.

1584
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:54,060
Let's go with...

1585
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:05,180
I'm just gonna steal and then put out this monkey.

1586
01:50:11,899 --> 01:50:12,460
That's...

1587
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:13,260
I can handle that.

1588
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:13,579
Don't worry.

1589
01:50:17,579 --> 01:50:18,220
Two damage.

1590
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:18,460
Oh.

1591
01:50:36,069 --> 01:50:36,869
Holy shit.

1592
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:41,260
Are you serious?

1593
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:44,119
Wow.

1594
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:47,130
All right.

1595
01:50:47,130 --> 01:50:47,609
Hold on.

1596
01:50:48,409 --> 01:50:50,279
That's a lot of damage.

1597
01:50:53,979 --> 01:50:55,659
Go for face or do I...

1598
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:57,539
Let me see.

1599
01:50:57,539 --> 01:50:57,859
Hold on.

1600
01:51:04,229 --> 01:51:06,119
Deal two damage to a friendly character.

1601
01:51:06,119 --> 01:51:07,399
Discover a demon.

1602
01:51:07,399 --> 01:51:09,420
Let's get this out here.

1603
01:51:19,779 --> 01:51:21,060
Oh, you're screwed.

1604
01:51:21,619 --> 01:51:22,899
I'm gonna make you draw your whole deck.

1605
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:27,930
I think I have lethal.

1606
01:51:28,970 --> 01:51:31,750
Yeah, I do.

1607
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:32,470
Three.

1608
01:51:32,470 --> 01:51:33,189
Yeah, I got lethal.

1609
01:51:54,899 --> 01:51:56,180
It's just fun to do this.

1610
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,199
I'm V...

1611
01:52:02,199 --> 01:52:03,000
I am V-aiming.

1612
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,399
That's fine.

1613
01:52:07,829 --> 01:52:08,710
Pretty good.

1614
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:09,189
In there.

1615
01:52:10,229 --> 01:52:11,510
See, aren't you guys having fun?

1616
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:14,149
It's fun just to play these little games.

1617
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:20,180
Who says no?

1618
01:52:23,859 --> 01:52:24,420
Remove them.

1619
01:52:34,899 --> 01:52:36,810
Oh, what do you think?

1620
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:38,729
Should I get two more eviscerates?

1621
01:52:38,729 --> 01:52:44,520
There are too many to ban.

1622
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:45,319
They're rising up.

1623
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:46,840
It's the mutiny.

1624
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:47,560
It's this stream.

1625
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:52,460
That's a lot of vanquish.

1626
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:57,369
And we get a Sneeds too.

1627
01:52:57,369 --> 01:52:58,090
That's pretty good.

1628
01:52:58,810 --> 01:52:59,289
I agree.

1629
01:53:06,659 --> 01:53:07,939
Uh, passive hero power.

1630
01:53:07,939 --> 01:53:11,939
You choose one cards and powers have both effects combined.

1631
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:20,310
What's going on here?

1632
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:35,350
So how much more difficult is heroic from here?

1633
01:53:44,779 --> 01:53:46,539
It's really, really hard, right?

1634
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:49,060
I don't think I can handle that.

1635
01:53:58,699 --> 01:53:59,819
It's baby mode.

1636
01:53:59,819 --> 01:54:02,140
Heroic is very easy and much harder than this.

1637
01:54:09,619 --> 01:54:10,739
What does that mean?

1638
01:54:10,739 --> 01:54:10,979
What?

1639
01:54:12,729 --> 01:54:15,130
Uh, let's just get a minion out.

1640
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:21,909
No!

1641
01:54:23,029 --> 01:54:25,850
May as well just concede.

1642
01:54:28,979 --> 01:54:30,180
It's like you were saying last night.

1643
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:32,819
This is baby mode Captain Crunch Hearthstone.

1644
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:34,979
But that's all right.

1645
01:54:35,699 --> 01:54:37,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

1646
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:40,409
Um, I think I have to just get rid of this.

1647
01:54:54,949 --> 01:54:57,189
Preparation into...

1648
01:54:57,189 --> 01:54:58,310
Oh, yeah.

1649
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:00,149
Preparation into Jade Shuriken.

1650
01:55:04,890 --> 01:55:06,170
Preparation draw deck.

1651
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:17,300
I'm not doing that.

1652
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:18,260
I couldn't even do that.

1653
01:55:24,539 --> 01:55:28,250
Ooh, okay, hold on.

1654
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:31,590
No, nope, nope.

1655
01:55:31,590 --> 01:55:33,670
Um, no.

1656
01:55:34,630 --> 01:55:37,340
Corrupt every minion.

1657
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,180
Destroy them at the start of your next turn.

1658
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:49,380
Oh, I can't.

1659
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:50,340
Why would I do that right now?

1660
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:53,979
Destroy them at the start of my next turn.

1661
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:56,630
That is really good.

1662
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:09,670
See, now I would use it.

1663
01:56:10,390 --> 01:56:11,430
Because that thing's stealth.

1664
01:56:12,229 --> 01:56:14,420
Click the towers.

1665
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:22,949
Oh, Futurama theme.

1666
01:56:22,949 --> 01:56:23,270
Nice.

1667
01:56:24,939 --> 01:56:26,699
Okay, uh, I'm gonna do this.

1668
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:28,460
And then I'm gonna put out...

1669
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:32,069
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't do that.

1670
01:56:32,069 --> 01:56:34,390
Is the Earth Mother listening?

1671
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:34,710
Yeah.

1672
01:56:37,829 --> 01:56:38,310
Where's the...

1673
01:56:39,829 --> 01:56:42,920
He's just gonna end up killing it.

1674
01:56:43,479 --> 01:56:47,079
Let's just get the fucking shark out here.

1675
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:52,119
Pretty good.

1676
01:57:04,579 --> 01:57:05,220
He's not...

1677
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:07,140
Okay, just going for face?

1678
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:07,859
What's up with that?

1679
01:57:11,989 --> 01:57:15,000
Well, now that changes things.

1680
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:20,739
Kill this.

1681
01:57:21,859 --> 01:57:22,340
And then...

1682
01:57:22,979 --> 01:57:24,020
I don't want to corrupt though.

1683
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:30,329
Oh my god, yes.

1684
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:32,359
Thank you.

1685
01:57:33,159 --> 01:57:33,880
Appreciate it.

1686
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:01,289
What?

1687
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:02,170
What?

1688
01:58:05,289 --> 01:58:06,810
Oh, the death rattle.

1689
01:58:06,810 --> 01:58:07,449
Oh, fuck.

1690
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:11,140
It's all right.

1691
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:13,060
I get plenty of good cards.

1692
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:16,020
All right, we got one.

1693
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:17,060
Uh, I can just...

1694
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:17,539
Hold on.

1695
01:58:17,539 --> 01:58:18,579
Wait, wait, wait.

1696
01:58:18,579 --> 01:58:20,260
Summoner Empt two cost minion.

1697
01:58:21,399 --> 01:58:21,960
Combo.

1698
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,260
Could do a couple combos here.

1699
01:58:25,979 --> 01:58:30,039
I don't think this is not lethal.

1700
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,520
Six, ten, eleven.

1701
01:58:37,609 --> 01:58:39,930
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.

1702
01:58:39,930 --> 01:58:40,810
That is nineteen.

1703
01:58:41,529 --> 01:58:45,930
Or eighteen.

1704
01:58:45,930 --> 01:58:47,859
I'm just gonna do this.

1705
01:59:08,859 --> 01:59:09,260
Damn.

1706
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:10,220
I wish I could do that.

1707
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:20,500
I'm gonna spread it out.

1708
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:21,460
I'm gonna spread it out a little.

1709
01:59:53,399 --> 01:59:53,800
Fuck.

1710
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:54,520
Why did I do that?

1711
01:59:59,659 --> 02:00:01,180
I can do one damage to somebody, right?

1712
02:00:02,039 --> 02:00:03,239
One damage to all of the minions.

1713
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:07,100
All right, get out there, you motherfucker.

1714
02:00:13,579 --> 02:00:15,020
And I can do bang.

1715
02:00:17,899 --> 02:00:19,020
Freeze this idiot.

1716
02:00:33,289 --> 02:00:34,489
What a huge play.

1717
02:00:35,609 --> 02:00:37,029
Pretty standard.

1718
02:00:41,989 --> 02:00:43,109
I think he's dead this turn, right?

1719
02:00:43,829 --> 02:00:48,149
You're just gonna heal over and over again?

1720
02:00:48,149 --> 02:00:48,630
Never mind.

1721
02:00:51,319 --> 02:00:52,119
All right, hold on.

1722
02:00:52,119 --> 02:00:52,439
I'm...

1723
02:00:52,439 --> 02:00:53,079
Hold on a minute.

1724
02:00:54,619 --> 02:00:55,340
I think I have it.

1725
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:56,140
Six, eight...

1726
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:56,619
No, I got it.

1727
02:00:56,619 --> 02:00:56,939
I got it.

1728
02:00:57,659 --> 02:00:59,340
I need to do this correct.

1729
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:01,579
Six, twelve, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

1730
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:04,140
Twenty-one, twenty, two.

1731
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:05,659
I need to...

1732
02:01:05,659 --> 02:01:05,899
Yeah.

1733
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:21,659
He doesn't know?

1734
02:01:21,659 --> 02:01:22,140
I saw it.

1735
02:01:26,229 --> 02:01:27,670
It's not BM if you're against the computer.

1736
02:01:27,670 --> 02:01:28,869
The computer doesn't have any feelings.

1737
02:01:29,510 --> 02:01:35,930
The computer does not have feelings.

1738
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:38,229
It's mathematical code.

1739
02:01:38,789 --> 02:01:47,380
All right, what do we want?

1740
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:48,579
You hurt my feelings.

1741
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:52,039
You have permanent stealth.

1742
02:01:54,409 --> 02:01:57,210
At the start of your turn, give a random minion a hand plus one plus one,

1743
02:01:57,210 --> 02:01:59,050
or you start with an extra mana crystal.

1744
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:00,970
That one's good, but boring.

1745
02:02:01,609 --> 02:02:06,630
This one seems broken.

1746
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:11,609
I think that's what we're doing.

1747
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:15,800
You minions have permanent stealth.

1748
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:17,829
What?

1749
02:02:17,829 --> 02:02:18,810
Creature box.

1750
02:02:19,369 --> 02:02:28,489
And I'm the number three Hearthstone streamer?

1751
02:02:31,819 --> 02:02:36,140
Well, I really might put a disclaimer up that I'm not very good.

1752
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:37,260
I'm just having fun.

1753
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:43,140
Two of Thoris?

1754
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:44,899
That makes three Vancleeps.

1755
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:47,579
The title already explains it.

1756
02:02:47,579 --> 02:02:48,380
Yeah, I guess it does.

1757
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:55,779
I remember when Emperor Thoris seemed unbearable.

1758
02:02:58,020 --> 02:02:59,659
He was so good.

1759
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:06,359
Is he still in every single deck?

1760
02:03:16,779 --> 02:03:17,500
Okay, what do we got?

1761
02:03:18,539 --> 02:03:19,979
Always starts in your hand.

1762
02:03:19,979 --> 02:03:21,899
I could do Vancleef to always start.

1763
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:25,819
Reduce the cost of a random card in your deck to zero.

1764
02:03:30,659 --> 02:03:32,899
Oh my god, what the hell is this?

1765
02:03:33,619 --> 02:03:36,149
2020?

1766
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:39,220
Starts dormant.

1767
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:39,779
Battle cry.

1768
02:03:39,779 --> 02:03:42,420
Shuffle three candles into the enemy deck when drawn.

1769
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:43,380
This awakens.

1770
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:49,619
What?

1771
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:56,359
Okay, so that's insane.

1772
02:03:57,609 --> 02:03:58,890
It never happens.

1773
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:01,050
Four mana, zero, zero.

1774
02:04:03,829 --> 02:04:05,590
Yeah, you just spend four mana.

1775
02:04:06,329 --> 02:04:08,810
It's just a coin that doesn't do anything, but it's four.

1776
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:15,220
All right, well, you know what to do.

1777
02:04:31,189 --> 02:04:32,630
You're all fired.

1778
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:39,060
Is that what you guys are clicking on?

1779
02:04:39,060 --> 02:04:39,380
Is that?

1780
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:39,779
No.

1781
02:04:39,779 --> 02:04:40,100
Is it?

1782
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:40,500
It is.

1783
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:44,140
Don't you know we want a bunch of Vancleefs?

1784
02:04:47,319 --> 02:04:49,989
We need to, we might need to enhance this again.

1785
02:04:55,859 --> 02:04:57,140
Yeah, I need to enhance it again.

1786
02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:08,069
Go for it.

1787
02:05:08,069 --> 02:05:09,750
Okay, I was about to throw everybody away.

1788
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:16,329
All right, so we're going to take them all into the enemy deck.

1789
02:05:16,329 --> 02:05:17,770
All right, yeah, let's go for it.

1790
02:05:17,770 --> 02:05:18,409
Take everybody.

1791
02:05:21,979 --> 02:05:22,779
All right, now what?

1792
02:05:23,579 --> 02:05:26,810
That thing's really interesting though.

1793
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:34,180
Four mana, zero, zero.

1794
02:05:35,109 --> 02:05:35,909
Unfortunately.

1795
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:42,300
All right, that's that one.

1796
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:48,460
Okay, let's see what it is.

1797
02:05:49,979 --> 02:05:56,300
The thing that we just got.

1798
02:05:59,140 --> 02:06:00,340
All right, are we good?

1799
02:06:00,899 --> 02:06:05,590
That was four mana, right?

1800
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:10,949
That's not bad.

1801
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:19,239
All right, let's go.

1802
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:22,500
Here we go.

1803
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:24,579
I'm fucking excited.

1804
02:06:24,579 --> 02:06:28,819
Is anybody else like just absolutely boiling with excitement right now?

1805
02:06:28,819 --> 02:06:33,989
And if you're not, then that's pretty normal.

1806
02:06:36,010 --> 02:06:39,210
Okay, so I'm going to 2-2 Treant with Taunt.

1807
02:06:39,850 --> 02:06:46,789
Is that two mana?

1808
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:55,210
This boss is overpowered.

1809
02:07:03,189 --> 02:07:04,630
Oh, fuck yeah.

1810
02:07:04,630 --> 02:07:07,350
Guaranteed win right here is zero, four, five.

1811
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:09,270
Deal two damage to all undamaged enemy minions.

1812
02:07:10,229 --> 02:07:10,949
Instantly going to win.

1813
02:07:18,359 --> 02:07:19,560
Only hard and heroic.

1814
02:07:25,189 --> 02:07:26,229
Save it for clear.

1815
02:07:27,689 --> 02:07:30,250
But it's so easy just to throw them out there right now.

1816
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:31,609
But zero mana.

1817
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:35,340
Okay, I will hold off.

1818
02:07:39,050 --> 02:07:46,539
Okay, steal or draw Deathrattle?

1819
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:58,760
I went with my gut.

1820
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,640
That was the wrong idea.

1821
02:08:00,359 --> 02:08:04,979
Okay, now I'm going to have to play this.

1822
02:08:05,619 --> 02:08:07,939
Oh shit, this is bad.

1823
02:08:13,130 --> 02:08:13,689
Not yet.

1824
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:15,770
It's killing me.

1825
02:08:16,789 --> 02:08:19,909
Oh, not yet, but they're getting this too many on the board.

1826
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:28,789
Do a Chad move and draw the deck.

1827
02:08:28,789 --> 02:08:29,909
No, not yet.

1828
02:08:32,659 --> 02:08:33,380
Oh, fuck.

1829
02:08:37,859 --> 02:08:38,659
Now I'm going to use it.

1830
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:43,529
Here we go.

1831
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:52,359
That is so good.

1832
02:08:52,359 --> 02:08:54,520
That is just ridiculous.

1833
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:04,630
Deal two damage to a minion if it survives.

1834
02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:05,670
Give it poisonous.

1835
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:08,630
I could do that to somebody on my team.

1836
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:16,100
What did that do?

1837
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:21,300
Convert your mana into minions and gain an empty mana crystal.

1838
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:28,409
Okay, deal.

1839
02:09:28,409 --> 02:09:29,210
No, that's not enough.

1840
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:34,520
That's bad.

1841
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:42,420
I think I'm going to just put out minions.

1842
02:09:47,130 --> 02:09:49,689
Or yeah, let's just go with the shark.

1843
02:09:58,939 --> 02:09:59,659
That sucks.

1844
02:10:03,369 --> 02:10:04,170
Can I eat this?

1845
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:05,850
How many turns can I eat this?

1846
02:10:14,899 --> 02:10:15,539
Never mind.

1847
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:16,739
Never mind.

1848
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:18,020
That's all good.

1849
02:10:18,659 --> 02:10:22,699
So now, yeah, it's just a DPS race.

1850
02:10:22,699 --> 02:10:23,020
Let's see.

1851
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:23,899
Give me something crazy.

1852
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:25,590
Damn it.

1853
02:10:38,069 --> 02:10:39,029
DPS race.

1854
02:10:39,029 --> 02:10:39,510
Let's go.

1855
02:10:40,470 --> 02:10:44,470
I want to get 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.

1856
02:10:46,779 --> 02:10:47,739
Did he just go twice?

1857
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:50,739
Okay, hold on.

1858
02:10:50,739 --> 02:10:56,460
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

1859
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:12,939
Oh, no, I thought that was a pick.

1860
02:11:12,939 --> 02:11:14,460
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1861
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:15,100
Can I have it back?

1862
02:11:22,359 --> 02:11:25,399
I thought that was a combo.

1863
02:11:25,399 --> 02:11:25,640
It's all right.

1864
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:26,520
I'm going to win.

1865
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:28,970
We shall block your path.

1866
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:35,020
God damn it.

1867
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:36,859
That was such a bonehead move.

1868
02:11:39,989 --> 02:11:40,630
All right, I win.

1869
02:11:42,489 --> 02:11:49,800
Let me think about 4, 5, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

1870
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:50,439
I got it.

1871
02:11:50,439 --> 02:11:50,920
It's over.

1872
02:12:05,510 --> 02:12:09,029
Thank you, Khadgar, for the 17 health for no reason.

1873
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:19,020
Where to?

1874
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:27,539
Look at all these wins.

1875
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:29,060
I know.

1876
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:31,300
Isn't it nice to win and not go 0-3 in Arena?

1877
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:41,539
So we got this is the one.

1878
02:12:41,539 --> 02:12:46,739
Unearthed Raptor, Anub'arak, and N'zoth the Corruptor.

1879
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:51,819
All these are so new.

1880
02:12:51,819 --> 02:12:53,260
I've never even seen half of these.

1881
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:56,100
More death rattles.

1882
02:12:58,569 --> 02:13:00,170
All right, Oxana.

1883
02:13:02,659 --> 02:13:05,460
After minion attacks, you deal 2 damage to it.

1884
02:13:06,020 --> 02:13:11,350
So just every time somebody attacks with Cho.

1885
02:13:12,229 --> 02:13:20,520
We haven't seen Cho in...

1886
02:13:21,239 --> 02:13:22,039
I don't want to play him.

1887
02:13:29,819 --> 02:13:30,859
So many of these.

1888
02:13:30,859 --> 02:13:31,819
That's too many of these.

1889
02:13:38,279 --> 02:13:40,279
He died last game, but yeah, thank God.

1890
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:43,539
All right, should I hold it?

1891
02:13:51,989 --> 02:13:53,829
I love how he's so nice and helpful.

1892
02:13:54,470 --> 02:13:59,210
All right, not yet.

1893
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:06,140
If your deck has only odd cost cards, draw a card.

1894
02:14:10,550 --> 02:14:14,069
Do people build their decks around having odd costs?

1895
02:14:14,710 --> 02:14:17,800
That seems just strange.

1896
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:21,140
Not anymore.

1897
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:22,500
It was overpowered before.

1898
02:14:23,460 --> 02:14:23,779
Damn.

1899
02:14:27,859 --> 02:14:29,859
Well, I would put it out, but maybe...

1900
02:14:29,859 --> 02:14:32,659
Is this the opportunity just to get control right here?

1901
02:14:33,220 --> 02:14:37,899
Or do I just send the cat out to die?

1902
02:14:37,899 --> 02:14:40,659
Let's get it right now.

1903
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:43,899
And then let's get Vancleef out there too.

1904
02:14:44,460 --> 02:14:45,100
You know what I mean?

1905
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:46,220
Like, fuck it.

1906
02:14:59,539 --> 02:15:00,340
And then here we go.

1907
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:04,979
Rush into the bandits.

1908
02:15:04,979 --> 02:15:10,569
This is a good run.

1909
02:15:11,210 --> 02:15:15,670
Cold blood on...

1910
02:15:28,979 --> 02:15:29,779
Do I have any heals?

1911
02:15:30,819 --> 02:15:33,750
Should I pull your hand into your deck?

1912
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:34,789
Draw that many cards.

1913
02:15:34,789 --> 02:15:35,270
What the...

1914
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:36,390
Wait, you can do that?

1915
02:15:37,189 --> 02:15:38,869
You just throw your hold hand away and...

1916
02:15:43,029 --> 02:15:44,310
All right, let me think about this.

1917
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:44,869
I need to...

1918
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:46,470
I can just get rid of this.

1919
02:15:47,189 --> 02:15:47,989
I might just...

1920
02:15:47,989 --> 02:15:48,869
Hold on, let me think.

1921
02:15:52,859 --> 02:15:55,500
I could just get rid of this and then face again.

1922
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:59,420
Or get rid of this and then do another cold blood.

1923
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:02,869
I could pull something.

1924
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:04,890
Let me pull something.

1925
02:16:06,489 --> 02:16:06,890
Damn it.

1926
02:16:07,529 --> 02:16:09,220
All right, well now I have to do that.

1927
02:16:29,739 --> 02:16:30,779
Oh, I could have killed it.

1928
02:16:30,779 --> 02:16:31,180
It's okay.

1929
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:31,579
Don't worry.

1930
02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:35,670
I could have killed it.

1931
02:16:36,549 --> 02:16:37,110
It's all right.

1932
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:37,590
I still can.

1933
02:16:37,590 --> 02:16:38,149
Everything's fine.

1934
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:42,920
Two lackeys.

1935
02:16:43,719 --> 02:16:45,899
All right, let's do the stupid cat.

1936
02:16:45,899 --> 02:16:51,500
And then the lackey or...

1937
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:52,860
Yeah, I want the lackeys.

1938
02:16:55,959 --> 02:16:56,520
All right, now...

1939
02:16:57,319 --> 02:16:59,079
Is it worth doing eight damage to face?

1940
02:16:59,079 --> 02:17:01,559
Or should I just hold this forever?

1941
02:17:01,559 --> 02:17:02,440
No, I have to do it.

1942
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:03,319
I have to go to the face.

1943
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:10,739
Plus one attack and rush.

1944
02:17:10,739 --> 02:17:11,700
Plus one attack and rush.

1945
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:12,420
I still have this.

1946
02:17:13,459 --> 02:17:15,190
That's not fair.

1947
02:17:23,030 --> 02:17:24,309
Restart your computer.

1948
02:17:25,510 --> 02:17:26,870
Maybe that'll fix it.

1949
02:17:26,870 --> 02:17:38,200
I don't think I want to do any of this.

1950
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,540
I can't play this.

1951
02:17:50,139 --> 02:17:51,100
This just is a dead card.

1952
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:51,659
It just dies.

1953
02:17:52,620 --> 02:17:55,659
All right, so lackey and then we'll do the bandits.

1954
02:17:56,379 --> 02:18:09,180
And then I'm gonna give cold blood to somebody.

1955
02:18:09,979 --> 02:18:13,940
Who should I give this to?

1956
02:18:15,319 --> 02:18:15,559
You.

1957
02:18:17,829 --> 02:18:19,909
And then I'm gonna trade you to you.

1958
02:18:22,899 --> 02:18:24,899
And everything's gonna be fine.

1959
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:29,000
But that's the thing I was talking about.

1960
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:39,879
All right, well, that's gone immediately.

1961
02:18:43,139 --> 02:18:43,780
I mean, right?

1962
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:53,899
I feel like I'm gonna get rid of that too.

1963
02:18:53,899 --> 02:18:57,819
I have to get rid of this.

1964
02:18:58,459 --> 02:18:59,899
This thing's gonna keep doing this forever.

1965
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:08,020
Face is good damage, but he's gonna keep bringing everybody in here.

1966
02:19:08,579 --> 02:19:19,540
If this minion survives damage, I'm gonna copy.

1967
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:20,579
Don't do the spin thing.

1968
02:19:21,219 --> 02:19:25,260
Combo, destroy a minion.

1969
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:25,659
Perfect.

1970
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:27,079
Lackey.

1971
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:28,489
Into.

1972
02:19:28,489 --> 02:19:29,370
Yeah, lackey.

1973
02:19:30,329 --> 02:19:33,049
Destroy the five, three.

1974
02:19:36,010 --> 02:19:38,969
And then we're gonna go like this.

1975
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:43,420
Bye, you.

1976
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:46,709
And then we hold.

1977
02:19:46,709 --> 02:19:47,350
What?

1978
02:19:47,350 --> 02:19:53,020
Yeah, because they'll just die.

1979
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:12,739
Play the totem.

1980
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:15,540
The totem dies.

1981
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:16,260
It doesn't do anything.

1982
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:19,239
Well, here we go.

1983
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:20,940
Give me something good.

1984
02:20:23,829 --> 02:20:25,350
That's really fucking good.

1985
02:20:26,069 --> 02:20:32,889
Here we go.

1986
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:37,719
Oh, damn it.

1987
02:20:37,719 --> 02:20:50,680
What's going on?

1988
02:21:11,370 --> 02:21:16,280
Hey, hey, there it is.

1989
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:17,719
Summon King Mukla.

1990
02:21:17,719 --> 02:21:20,440
Give it immune and can't be targeted by spells or hero powers.

1991
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:24,739
Thanks, Khadgar.

1992
02:21:24,739 --> 02:21:25,299
Appreciate it.

1993
02:21:25,299 --> 02:21:26,739
Now it doesn't even matter.

1994
02:21:26,739 --> 02:21:33,670
If I have, I think I win.

1995
02:21:40,170 --> 02:21:41,049
What is he doing?

1996
02:21:43,989 --> 02:21:46,229
Why did he just do all that at the very end here?

1997
02:21:46,229 --> 02:21:48,870
Thanks for nothing for the first like 12 turns.

1998
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:57,959
What do you guys think?

1999
02:22:06,819 --> 02:22:08,020
How am I this good?

2000
02:22:09,430 --> 02:22:10,790
Well, it takes a lot of practice.

2001
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:18,600
All right, shuffle five random treasures into your deck.

2002
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:20,120
I don't think I've ever even seen what this does.

2003
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:23,690
Take an extra turn.

2004
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:25,370
Your opponent takes an extra turn after.

2005
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:28,899
That kind of sucks.

2006
02:22:29,459 --> 02:22:30,739
This one's pretty good.

2007
02:22:30,739 --> 02:22:33,780
Draw this every turn at the start of every game you draw this.

2008
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:39,129
It has taunt and it gets plus one plus one every turn it's in my hand.

2009
02:22:44,219 --> 02:22:44,700
Taking this.

2010
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:49,340
What do you think?

2011
02:22:49,340 --> 02:22:53,110
We're getting close to the last like two or three.

2012
02:22:53,110 --> 02:22:55,270
Usually the last two or three are usually pretty hard.

2013
02:22:56,379 --> 02:23:00,100
They're just so just random all over the place.

2014
02:23:00,100 --> 02:23:04,819
It's hard to beat them sometimes and I don't this is kind of split here.

2015
02:23:05,459 --> 02:23:07,819
58, 20.

2016
02:23:07,819 --> 02:23:09,770
There we go.

2017
02:23:09,770 --> 02:23:10,649
Draw!

2018
02:23:10,649 --> 02:23:12,489
You want me to start getting some draw?

2019
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:17,079
Is this the last one?

2020
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:22,180
We got some pretty good shit though.

2021
02:23:22,180 --> 02:23:27,590
Okay, now this is it.

2022
02:23:34,469 --> 02:23:37,190
Code a minion and blast powder when it takes damage destroyed.

2023
02:23:37,190 --> 02:23:37,909
I remember this.

2024
02:23:39,350 --> 02:23:42,069
There's something, there's some wires and stuff.

2025
02:23:42,069 --> 02:23:42,950
I'm gonna fuck this up.

2026
02:23:49,530 --> 02:23:53,290
Yeah, if these two wires touch you take five damage at the beginning of the turn or something.

2027
02:23:53,930 --> 02:23:57,829
But the stealth is just so overpowered.

2028
02:24:03,190 --> 02:24:09,829
Permanent stealth against this character.

2029
02:24:12,299 --> 02:24:13,739
It will never activate.

2030
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:17,420
It's never gonna activate when I get him out there.

2031
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:20,139
That's so funny.

2032
02:24:23,190 --> 02:24:24,149
He's not gonna be able to do it.

2033
02:24:24,389 --> 02:24:34,139
Wait, did I give you the wire?

2034
02:24:36,520 --> 02:24:37,159
All right, well let's...

2035
02:24:38,819 --> 02:24:41,860
The only time that this card has ever been useful is right now.

2036
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:44,709
Well, I can't really do anything so...

2037
02:24:46,969 --> 02:24:48,489
And I got Ragnaros.

2038
02:24:48,489 --> 02:24:50,170
Random Ragnaros Lightlord.

2039
02:24:50,170 --> 02:24:52,569
I'm not, it's impossible for me to lose.

2040
02:24:55,299 --> 02:24:55,860
It just isn't.

2041
02:24:56,579 --> 02:24:57,540
I, there's no way.

2042
02:24:57,540 --> 02:24:58,659
It's impossible.

2043
02:24:58,659 --> 02:25:04,420
It used to be about the explosions man.

2044
02:25:04,420 --> 02:25:05,139
What happened?

2045
02:25:10,950 --> 02:25:11,670
Okay, but hold on.

2046
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:14,469
Don't get too overconfident because I still have to like do this.

2047
02:25:18,549 --> 02:25:20,149
I still have to get here.

2048
02:25:20,149 --> 02:25:23,670
So this is actually a really terrible start.

2049
02:25:29,209 --> 02:25:29,850
Four, one.

2050
02:25:36,090 --> 02:25:36,729
This is bad.

2051
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:43,000
If I play the miscreen I'm not gonna get the combo though.

2052
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:43,719
And he's just gonna...

2053
02:25:46,090 --> 02:25:46,969
I guess it makes sense.

2054
02:25:54,540 --> 02:25:57,979
He's starting to load up to a point where I actually might lose.

2055
02:26:03,079 --> 02:26:05,239
I'm getting way too high cost cards.

2056
02:26:05,799 --> 02:26:06,680
This is very bad.

2057
02:26:08,409 --> 02:26:09,850
All right, four, who's...

2058
02:26:09,850 --> 02:26:10,729
Okay, I gotta get rid of you.

2059
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:14,200
So I gotta take out you.

2060
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:19,430
So I'm gonna do that with an cold blood.

2061
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:27,100
That will give me able to clear it.

2062
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:27,979
Okay, that's what I'm doing.

2063
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:40,229
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2064
02:26:40,229 --> 02:26:41,079
It's okay.

2065
02:26:51,370 --> 02:26:52,149
It's fine.

2066
02:26:52,149 --> 02:26:52,629
Everything's good.

2067
02:26:52,629 --> 02:26:53,030
It's all right.

2068
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:55,829
I can, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

2069
02:26:55,829 --> 02:27:00,219
I'm just gonna get the darkness out there and everything seems fine.

2070
02:27:10,409 --> 02:27:12,489
Oh no, should I do King Wukla?

2071
02:27:12,489 --> 02:27:13,850
Maybe I should just do King Wukla.

2072
02:27:17,899 --> 02:27:18,399
Or...

2073
02:27:21,559 --> 02:27:23,159
It doesn't work like that?

2074
02:27:23,159 --> 02:27:23,959
That won't work?

2075
02:27:26,219 --> 02:27:28,139
Oh, it spawns over here.

2076
02:27:28,139 --> 02:27:29,340
Oh, Jesus.

2077
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:29,840
Okay.

2078
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:37,319
Does this count as a minion?

2079
02:27:37,319 --> 02:27:38,760
Okay, at the first second I dump...

2080
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:39,959
Does this count as a minion?

2081
02:27:39,959 --> 02:27:49,670
I just gotta make it to round eight.

2082
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:51,979
All right, this is how we do this.

2083
02:27:53,430 --> 02:27:55,100
We go.

2084
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:55,600
Bang.

2085
02:27:59,340 --> 02:27:59,979
Knuckles?

2086
02:27:59,979 --> 02:28:01,100
No, I need to get rid of...

2087
02:28:04,149 --> 02:28:05,750
I'm just gonna shuriken the zombie.

2088
02:28:08,549 --> 02:28:10,870
And then I'm gonna eviscerate him.

2089
02:28:20,250 --> 02:28:20,889
And then steal.

2090
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:24,920
What the hell happened?

2091
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:27,379
Oh, come on.

2092
02:28:38,459 --> 02:28:39,739
Thank God, nobody was stealthed.

2093
02:28:39,739 --> 02:28:40,700
That's no stealth card.

2094
02:28:48,219 --> 02:28:52,500
All right, now we've got King Wukla now.

2095
02:28:53,399 --> 02:28:53,899
Or...

2096
02:28:55,590 --> 02:29:11,459
Yeah, that's time for Wukla.

2097
02:29:11,459 --> 02:29:13,739
What?

2098
02:29:13,739 --> 02:29:14,700
Why are you doing this?

2099
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:16,620
Oh my God, this is so bad for him.

2100
02:29:18,299 --> 02:29:19,899
That was so bad.

2101
02:29:19,899 --> 02:29:21,739
Holy shit, that was terrible.

2102
02:29:21,739 --> 02:29:23,180
That's the...

2103
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:23,899
Hey, is that...

2104
02:29:23,899 --> 02:29:26,299
Hey, is that Jermadonite V playing on the other team?

2105
02:29:28,379 --> 02:29:35,370
But hold on.

2106
02:29:35,370 --> 02:29:36,250
Ragnaros time.

2107
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:38,569
No, I can't lose!

2108
02:29:39,610 --> 02:29:40,569
That was a voice crack.

2109
02:29:40,569 --> 02:29:41,069
It's okay.

2110
02:29:48,870 --> 02:29:50,549
Yeah, now I guess I'm fine.

2111
02:30:07,989 --> 02:30:14,389
How do I take care of that?

2112
02:30:14,389 --> 02:30:15,270
What do I do about this?

2113
02:30:16,069 --> 02:30:16,569
Hold on.

2114
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:19,879
I can't be...

2115
02:30:19,879 --> 02:30:21,799
I can't have him taunting because he has permanent stealth.

2116
02:30:27,049 --> 02:30:28,649
Nobody can taunt because they're stealthed.

2117
02:30:39,690 --> 02:30:40,250
I lose.

2118
02:30:40,889 --> 02:30:53,780
I'm actually gonna lose because I can't put on the weapon.

2119
02:30:57,299 --> 02:30:57,940
Play Edwin.

2120
02:30:59,930 --> 02:31:01,850
Just attack with it, but he's...

2121
02:31:02,940 --> 02:31:03,979
I'm in trouble.

2122
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:30,540
Yeet him!

2123
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:32,860
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven!

2124
02:31:32,860 --> 02:31:34,680
It's not...

2125
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:35,239
I got it.

2126
02:31:35,239 --> 02:31:36,780
What?

2127
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:51,530
Is this gonna counterspell me?

2128
02:31:51,530 --> 02:31:52,899
All right.

2129
02:31:52,899 --> 02:31:53,780
We're okay.

2130
02:31:53,780 --> 02:32:11,690
We're back to normal.

2131
02:32:11,690 --> 02:32:16,649
So I'm like scared.

2132
02:32:16,649 --> 02:32:18,170
Can you draw a candle already, please?

2133
02:32:18,809 --> 02:32:21,500
Thank you for that.

2134
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:22,059
I'll take it.

2135
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:25,350
Shuffle five random treasures into your deck.

2136
02:32:26,729 --> 02:32:27,770
All right, give me these.

2137
02:32:27,770 --> 02:32:30,889
I have 28 cards in my deck.

2138
02:32:30,889 --> 02:32:36,920
I'm never gonna see those.

2139
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:38,920
I can't even kill this!

2140
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:39,959
Four, five, six...

2141
02:32:39,959 --> 02:32:40,360
I'm gonna...

2142
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:46,540
Where's the...

2143
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:48,780
Discover a druid, rogue, or shaman card.

2144
02:32:52,629 --> 02:32:53,030
Let's see.

2145
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:57,260
Deal two damage to the enemy hero.

2146
02:32:57,260 --> 02:32:59,180
If you control a treant, discover a spell.

2147
02:32:59,180 --> 02:33:00,459
When you overload, I don't...

2148
02:33:02,139 --> 02:33:03,739
Headcrack is the only thing I can do.

2149
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:12,780
And then just get out the raptor?

2150
02:33:21,690 --> 02:33:22,489
Well, give me the heal.

2151
02:33:32,979 --> 02:33:35,719
Now draw the fucking candles.

2152
02:33:39,530 --> 02:33:41,370
What did I just get?

2153
02:33:41,370 --> 02:33:42,010
What's going on?

2154
02:33:42,649 --> 02:33:46,170
Your opponent summoned a minion from their deck and I got...

2155
02:33:46,170 --> 02:33:46,649
Sneed!

2156
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:48,520
All right.

2157
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:48,920
Hold on.

2158
02:33:49,559 --> 02:33:55,450
Do I have like one damage?

2159
02:33:55,450 --> 02:33:58,940
Is this thing gonna get...

2160
02:33:58,940 --> 02:33:59,260
Sneed?

2161
02:34:04,139 --> 02:34:04,780
Give me the shit.

2162
02:34:05,899 --> 02:34:09,540
Okay.

2163
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:13,620
What?

2164
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:14,899
Go dormant?

2165
02:34:14,899 --> 02:34:16,340
Play four cards?

2166
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:17,940
What's with all this dormant shit?

2167
02:34:20,149 --> 02:34:21,430
I need to make space.

2168
02:34:21,430 --> 02:34:21,909
Oh, right.

2169
02:34:21,909 --> 02:34:22,629
I have to make space.

2170
02:34:23,270 --> 02:34:24,309
Let's kill this guy.

2171
02:34:26,229 --> 02:34:27,829
And then you die here.

2172
02:34:28,709 --> 02:34:29,829
So now there's enough space.

2173
02:34:30,709 --> 02:34:34,780
And then Thor is sent.

2174
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:43,059
I'm in a pretty good spot now.

2175
02:34:43,059 --> 02:34:43,540
I'm pretty...

2176
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:44,340
This should be it.

2177
02:34:48,389 --> 02:34:50,090
Free and real.

2178
02:34:50,729 --> 02:34:51,290
Holy fuck.

2179
02:34:51,290 --> 02:34:52,010
That would have been awesome.

2180
02:34:52,729 --> 02:34:58,790
All right.

2181
02:34:58,790 --> 02:35:01,450
So now just give me that.

2182
02:35:06,299 --> 02:35:10,309
Now we're gonna just load him up.

2183
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:24,309
What happened?

2184
02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:31,500
Doesn't matter, motherfucker.

2185
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:33,659
It doesn't matter.

2186
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:35,690
Hey.

2187
02:35:36,709 --> 02:35:46,149
Draw two minions from your deck.

2188
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:48,709
Set their attack health and cost to one?

2189
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:53,350
This is baby shit.

2190
02:35:53,350 --> 02:35:53,850
Uh-oh.

2191
02:35:54,629 --> 02:35:55,590
No, he's not scary.

2192
02:35:56,389 --> 02:35:59,959
All right.

2193
02:35:59,959 --> 02:36:01,079
Do I win with an extra turn?

2194
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:05,879
That's seven.

2195
02:36:05,879 --> 02:36:06,440
Fourteen.

2196
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:08,139
No.

2197
02:36:08,139 --> 02:36:10,489
I don't win with an extra turn.

2198
02:36:11,129 --> 02:36:12,649
I gotta clear this though,

2199
02:36:12,649 --> 02:36:13,610
because he has no cards.

2200
02:36:15,829 --> 02:36:16,870
I gotta play this right.

2201
02:36:17,590 --> 02:36:18,309
Three damage.

2202
02:36:19,110 --> 02:36:21,190
So get your text off the screen.

2203
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:21,909
I'm trying to focus.

2204
02:36:25,579 --> 02:36:26,219
Headcrack.

2205
02:36:26,219 --> 02:36:27,340
I don't win with a headcrack.

2206
02:36:28,680 --> 02:36:30,040
Two turns of 26...

2207
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:30,520
Head...

2208
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:30,840
What do you mean?

2209
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:31,319
Wait, what?

2210
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:38,979
It is lethal.

2211
02:36:40,440 --> 02:36:41,000
Seven.

2212
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:41,559
Fourteen.

2213
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:43,670
Nineteen.

2214
02:36:44,629 --> 02:36:45,270
Twenty-four.

2215
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:47,239
Twenty...

2216
02:37:08,540 --> 02:37:13,850
What happened?

2217
02:37:13,850 --> 02:37:15,139
What happened?

2218
02:37:15,139 --> 02:37:15,620
Oh, okay.

2219
02:37:26,899 --> 02:37:27,459
Oh, fuck.

2220
02:37:27,459 --> 02:37:29,219
Oh, I'm miss-clicking.

2221
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:36,600
I thought I had to do it afterwards.

2222
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:41,659
Tuber.

2223
02:37:43,989 --> 02:37:44,549
LOL.

2224
02:37:44,549 --> 02:37:45,190
So funny.

2225
02:37:45,190 --> 02:37:46,149
Hey, run complete.

2226
02:37:46,149 --> 02:37:47,030
I did it with the rogue.

2227
02:37:48,219 --> 02:37:48,860
This is fun.

2228
02:37:53,829 --> 02:37:57,579
Hooray.

2229
02:37:57,579 --> 02:37:58,139
Alright.

2230
02:37:58,139 --> 02:37:58,459
Again.

2231
02:38:05,219 --> 02:38:06,260
Now do that on heroic.

2232
02:38:07,139 --> 02:38:08,180
I'm not ready for heroic.

2233
02:38:15,639 --> 02:38:16,760
I'm not ready for heroic.

2234
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:17,159
You are?

2235
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:19,079
Alright, I'll try it once.

2236
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:36,069
Okay.

2237
02:38:36,069 --> 02:38:37,190
Chapter one, heroic.

2238
02:38:38,579 --> 02:38:40,979
I'm not going to be able to do this.

2239
02:38:40,979 --> 02:38:41,940
I'm not ready for this.

2240
02:38:42,659 --> 02:38:51,770
Play anomaly mode?

2241
02:38:51,770 --> 02:38:52,889
What is anomaly mode?

2242
02:38:53,850 --> 02:39:00,649
Alright, we got druid.

2243
02:39:01,290 --> 02:39:05,610
Looks like people want to see druid.

2244
02:39:06,250 --> 02:39:08,899
Anomaly is more random rules.

2245
02:39:08,899 --> 02:39:09,540
That's cool.

2246
02:39:10,340 --> 02:39:13,959
Alright, we're going to do druid.

2247
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:15,559
I'm going to pee.

2248
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:20,700
So, you guys can pick.

2249
02:39:22,569 --> 02:39:24,250
There's nothing for you to pick, so never mind.

2250
02:39:25,209 --> 02:39:27,399
And there's just this.

2251
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:28,600
Okay.

2252
02:39:31,379 --> 02:39:32,500
Well, I'm not going to pee.

2253
02:39:32,500 --> 02:39:33,459
Well, I'm not going to pee yet.

2254
02:39:33,459 --> 02:39:35,219
Let me see if I can get through the first person.

2255
02:39:41,110 --> 02:39:46,549
Okay, so this is swap the leftmost card in each player's hand with one in their deck.

2256
02:39:47,270 --> 02:39:51,420
So, you just everybody on the left swaps out.

2257
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:53,020
Let's see if I can even do the first level.

2258
02:39:59,290 --> 02:40:00,969
I'm not embarrassed if I can't do this on heroic.

2259
02:40:09,420 --> 02:40:09,899
Do I pee?

2260
02:40:09,899 --> 02:40:10,219
I will.

2261
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:11,420
After this.

2262
02:40:17,319 --> 02:40:18,440
He's going to get embarrassed.

2263
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:18,760
Maybe.

2264
02:40:19,559 --> 02:40:22,569
This is the one with the coins in the middle.

2265
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:26,540
Alright, what do you think?

2266
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:28,860
After this minion attacks a hero, add a copy of it to your hand.

2267
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:29,579
That's not bad.

2268
02:40:30,540 --> 02:40:32,139
Add two 1-1 squirrels.

2269
02:40:32,940 --> 02:40:33,739
Yeah, definitely this.

2270
02:40:38,219 --> 02:40:38,780
Oh, shit.

2271
02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:39,899
You're going to pull that.

2272
02:40:39,899 --> 02:40:40,379
That's alright.

2273
02:40:46,100 --> 02:40:49,219
Give a friendly minion 1-1 and gain armor equal to its attack.

2274
02:40:56,600 --> 02:40:56,920
Shit.

2275
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:06,649
I need to play this.

2276
02:41:07,610 --> 02:41:09,209
Because this is going to disappear.

2277
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:17,479
I already lost.

2278
02:41:19,020 --> 02:41:24,139
And then give this the 1-1 so it can't die from here.

2279
02:41:28,549 --> 02:41:30,069
Yeah, let's try it.

2280
02:41:30,069 --> 02:41:30,950
I'm not going to attack.

2281
02:41:36,010 --> 02:41:37,690
That's actually really good.

2282
02:41:37,690 --> 02:41:38,729
I'm happy that just happened.

2283
02:41:39,690 --> 02:41:42,979
Minus two attack until your next turn.

2284
02:41:42,979 --> 02:41:43,700
What the fuck.

2285
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:51,979
After you summon a minion, give it plus one plus one.

2286
02:41:52,780 --> 02:41:57,819
Shit.

2287
02:41:58,379 --> 02:42:02,340
I'm just going to have to...

2288
02:42:07,190 --> 02:42:08,899
Do I even attack?

2289
02:42:09,700 --> 02:42:14,040
This is going to kill me.

2290
02:42:21,479 --> 02:42:21,799
Shit.

2291
02:42:25,479 --> 02:42:26,680
Okay, that's not horrible.

2292
02:42:29,799 --> 02:42:35,659
Gain six armor, recruit a minion that costs four or less.

2293
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:39,079
Or do I shapeshift into this?

2294
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:53,979
Because then they'll get...

2295
02:42:53,979 --> 02:42:54,700
Okay, and then...

2296
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:01,399
That's pretty good.

2297
02:43:03,079 --> 02:43:03,879
Should I do them all?

2298
02:43:04,520 --> 02:43:10,469
All right, this is where it gets to be...

2299
02:43:14,250 --> 02:43:15,209
I have to get rid of that.

2300
02:43:27,239 --> 02:43:29,719
Value trade 3-2 in face of 2-1.

2301
02:43:31,239 --> 02:43:31,479
Yeah.

2302
02:43:34,469 --> 02:43:34,790
Yeah.

2303
02:43:36,329 --> 02:43:37,530
Thank you, guy in the chat.

2304
02:43:38,329 --> 02:43:41,290
Appreciate all that good stuff that you just told me.

2305
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:48,020
You know, it's heroic, so I'm just...

2306
02:43:48,739 --> 02:43:50,260
I don't know why my brain is like,

2307
02:43:50,260 --> 02:43:51,860
no, no, no, everything needs to be...

2308
02:43:51,860 --> 02:43:53,459
Be careful, I need help.

2309
02:43:53,459 --> 02:43:55,299
I think that's it.

2310
02:43:55,299 --> 02:43:55,700
Yeah, that's it.

2311
02:43:57,540 --> 02:44:04,379
That was easy.

2312
02:44:04,379 --> 02:44:05,260
It was.

2313
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:06,379
I'm overthinking things.

2314
02:44:06,379 --> 02:44:06,940
All right, I'm going to pee.

2315
02:44:08,139 --> 02:44:08,940
Well, you vote for the...

2316
02:44:09,659 --> 02:44:10,459
So difficult.

2317
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:14,219
There you go.

2318
02:44:15,100 --> 02:44:16,059
Let's see what it's going to be.

2319
02:44:16,940 --> 02:44:21,079
Draw two cards at the start of the game.

2320
02:44:21,719 --> 02:44:23,479
Gain two armor when somebody dies.

2321
02:44:24,549 --> 02:44:27,110
Or your death rattles trigger twice.

2322
02:44:27,750 --> 02:44:34,360
How many death rattles do I have?

2323
02:44:35,239 --> 02:44:37,350
I think one or two.

2324
02:44:39,719 --> 02:44:39,959
Two.

2325
02:44:43,860 --> 02:44:44,180
Three.

2326
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,440
All right, yeah, I mean, if we're going to pick this,

2327
02:44:54,440 --> 02:44:56,280
then we're going to go straight up death rattle.

2328
02:44:59,530 --> 02:45:00,649
Is there a death rattle here?

2329
02:45:06,649 --> 02:45:07,049
Gruul.

2330
02:45:07,850 --> 02:45:08,809
Well, there is one.

2331
02:45:13,620 --> 02:45:15,299
The mulch muncher?

2332
02:45:22,299 --> 02:45:23,260
Big friends.

2333
02:45:26,309 --> 02:45:28,709
Summon a minion from your hand with five or more attack.

2334
02:45:30,250 --> 02:45:32,729
Yeah, that doesn't do anything for us, unfortunately.

2335
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:35,780
But Gruul is just Gruul.

2336
02:45:38,149 --> 02:45:38,950
Yeah, that sucks.

2337
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:41,110
Summon five minions with five or more attack.

2338
02:45:41,590 --> 02:45:44,549
And we have to start working on this shit, too.

2339
02:45:50,459 --> 02:45:53,079
Well, the people want Gruul.

2340
02:45:53,719 --> 02:45:57,350
So they're going to get Gruul.

2341
02:45:57,989 --> 02:45:58,889
All right, OEP.

2342
02:45:59,450 --> 02:46:00,600
I'll be right back.

2343
02:46:03,639 --> 02:46:05,639
Haven't been playing Hearthstone for three hours.

2344
02:46:05,639 --> 02:46:06,440
Damn.

2345
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:09,110
I'm having fun, though.

2346
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:09,750
It's a fun game.

2347
02:46:11,430 --> 02:46:16,790
When you have 3,500 people help you make decisions on every play.

2348
02:46:17,590 --> 02:46:18,069
It's fun.

2349
02:46:18,629 --> 02:46:19,190
I'll be right back.

2350
02:49:42,059 --> 02:49:45,959
Okay, sorry I was going for a little bit longer.

2351
02:49:45,959 --> 02:49:51,860
I wanted to get a drink because it's been like four hours

2352
02:49:51,860 --> 02:49:53,299
and I haven't really had anything to drink.

2353
02:49:53,299 --> 02:49:55,860
So I had coffee sitting here.

2354
02:49:56,579 --> 02:50:02,020
But I needed something a little more substantial.

2355
02:50:02,659 --> 02:50:03,219
All right, let's go.

2356
02:50:07,860 --> 02:50:08,500
What's the drink?

2357
02:50:08,500 --> 02:50:10,420
It is just a sparkling water.

2358
02:50:11,059 --> 02:50:16,459
It's not anything too interesting.

2359
02:50:23,989 --> 02:50:25,270
Just a little bit of bubbles.

2360
02:50:25,270 --> 02:50:26,549
All right, so do I even play this shit?

2361
02:50:27,510 --> 02:50:29,899
I don't think I even have these in my deck.

2362
02:50:30,620 --> 02:50:44,040
Pineapple juice is going to kill you, you know.

2363
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:44,760
Ooh, that's good.

2364
02:50:45,399 --> 02:50:47,000
All right, what does he do?

2365
02:50:47,799 --> 02:50:53,739
All right, add a random magical feat to your hand.

2366
02:50:54,299 --> 02:50:56,520
All right, so he puts feet in his hand.

2367
02:50:57,239 --> 02:51:00,059
So death rattles trigger twice.

2368
02:51:00,059 --> 02:51:00,780
Let's get the...

2369
02:51:01,420 --> 02:51:02,299
Let's get him out there.

2370
02:51:14,969 --> 02:51:15,370
Get that.

2371
02:51:17,860 --> 02:51:21,000
Ooh, give me millions.

2372
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:21,559
One, one.

2373
02:51:22,780 --> 02:51:23,739
Well, this thing is free.

2374
02:51:23,739 --> 02:51:24,700
So here, just play it.

2375
02:51:25,860 --> 02:51:26,659
All right, summon two.

2376
02:51:30,579 --> 02:51:34,860
Or, yeah, let's just get rid of this.

2377
02:51:34,860 --> 02:51:37,510
Do I want the one, one?

2378
02:51:37,510 --> 02:51:38,790
No, because it's a twin spell.

2379
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:39,750
Did it bring out the trance?

2380
02:51:40,469 --> 02:51:43,379
Just bring them all out.

2381
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:48,219
I'm going for it.

2382
02:51:49,180 --> 02:51:51,930
I'm going for a kill immediately.

2383
02:52:04,329 --> 02:52:05,370
All right, that was a good outcome.

2384
02:52:08,010 --> 02:52:08,489
Jesus.

2385
02:52:08,489 --> 02:52:10,729
Give a friendly mini one, one, then gain attack equal...

2386
02:52:10,729 --> 02:52:12,409
The armor equal to its attack.

2387
02:52:14,309 --> 02:52:16,149
So I gotta think about this here.

2388
02:52:18,139 --> 02:52:24,520
So we get two, two.

2389
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,120
And then I could get rid of that.

2390
02:52:30,860 --> 02:52:32,379
All right, so hold on.

2391
02:52:33,020 --> 02:52:34,600
I can...

2392
02:52:36,940 --> 02:52:40,790
Two fucking goddamn math.

2393
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:42,729
I can't do math.

2394
02:52:42,729 --> 02:52:43,209
Yes, I can.

2395
02:52:56,059 --> 02:53:15,450
Was that wrong?

2396
02:53:18,329 --> 02:53:19,770
That was okay.

2397
02:53:20,409 --> 02:53:22,010
That wasn't completely wrong, was it?

2398
02:53:23,780 --> 02:53:24,420
Was it wrong?

2399
02:53:24,420 --> 02:53:25,219
No, it was right.

2400
02:53:30,100 --> 02:53:31,059
It was a little bit wrong.

2401
02:53:31,059 --> 02:53:31,780
Wasn't that wrong?

2402
02:53:31,780 --> 02:53:32,340
It was okay.

2403
02:53:33,299 --> 02:53:37,770
All right, I can do this twice.

2404
02:53:38,649 --> 02:53:39,209
Again.

2405
02:53:39,209 --> 02:53:45,989
So we're going to one, one onto six armor.

2406
02:53:45,989 --> 02:53:46,790
That's insane.

2407
02:53:48,069 --> 02:53:48,469
I think I...

2408
02:53:48,469 --> 02:53:49,430
Do I have it?

2409
02:53:50,409 --> 02:53:54,409
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2410
02:53:56,540 --> 02:54:03,819
No, I don't have it.

2411
02:54:03,819 --> 02:54:05,659
Oh, it's all minions.

2412
02:54:05,659 --> 02:54:08,059
Oh, I thought it was give a minion.

2413
02:54:08,459 --> 02:54:10,969
Minion.

2414
02:54:10,969 --> 02:54:16,639
All right.

2415
02:54:26,729 --> 02:54:34,709
Three mana, give a minion, one, one.

2416
02:54:34,709 --> 02:54:37,030
Yeah, that would be absolute dog shit.

2417
02:54:37,030 --> 02:54:38,709
What the hell am I talking about?

2418
02:54:38,709 --> 02:54:43,260
Look at how desperate he is right now.

2419
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:44,379
He's trying so hard.

2420
02:54:44,379 --> 02:54:45,100
He's going to lose.

2421
02:54:58,889 --> 02:54:59,930
Am I going to get to play?

2422
02:55:01,510 --> 02:55:01,909
Jesus.

2423
02:55:02,549 --> 02:55:18,739
Get that squirrel BM.

2424
02:55:18,739 --> 02:55:19,379
Not a big deal.

2425
02:55:22,569 --> 02:55:23,370
All right.

2426
02:55:23,370 --> 02:55:25,420
What do you guys think?

2427
02:55:29,430 --> 02:55:32,149
Do you not need to kill the gold treasure thing?

2428
02:55:32,149 --> 02:55:35,940
No, what it does is it gives both players two coins.

2429
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:39,719
So, you know, you could...

2430
02:55:40,440 --> 02:55:44,440
Time for arena.

2431
02:55:45,079 --> 02:55:46,969
Now that was so embarrassing.

2432
02:55:46,969 --> 02:55:47,930
That just was so...

2433
02:55:48,729 --> 02:55:50,420
I can't.

2434
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:51,860
I can't do that again.

2435
02:55:51,860 --> 02:55:53,940
All right, we got big friends.

2436
02:55:54,659 --> 02:55:59,350
Should we try it one more time before I stop?

2437
02:55:59,989 --> 02:56:02,459
I have to redeem myself.

2438
02:56:02,459 --> 02:56:02,780
Yeah.

2439
02:56:02,780 --> 02:56:03,180
All right.

2440
02:56:03,180 --> 02:56:04,059
I'll try it.

2441
02:56:04,059 --> 02:56:04,459
Not now.

2442
02:56:05,639 --> 02:56:06,840
After like another run or two.

2443
02:56:08,700 --> 02:56:09,659
I'm still having fun.

2444
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:12,540
It's just fun just to...

2445
02:56:12,540 --> 02:56:14,459
I'm not very good.

2446
02:56:14,459 --> 02:56:16,379
How many times is he going to say he's not good?

2447
02:56:17,340 --> 02:56:17,579
All right.

2448
02:56:17,579 --> 02:56:18,139
We'll take this.

2449
02:56:25,219 --> 02:56:26,180
The Amazing Boomer.

2450
02:56:26,739 --> 02:56:30,520
Cast a random spell that was cast this game

2451
02:56:30,520 --> 02:56:32,440
chosen randomly on targets.

2452
02:56:33,079 --> 02:56:34,440
Okay.

2453
02:56:34,440 --> 02:56:35,770
Cool.

2454
02:56:35,770 --> 02:56:36,250
Interesting.

2455
02:56:55,659 --> 02:56:56,139
All right.

2456
02:56:56,139 --> 02:56:57,979
I still don't have enough.

2457
02:56:58,780 --> 02:56:59,579
Maybe I do now.

2458
02:57:02,409 --> 02:57:05,049
How many minions do I have over five attack?

2459
02:57:05,770 --> 02:57:08,950
I think I have it now.

2460
02:57:10,659 --> 02:57:12,899
But they're all late game cards.

2461
02:57:19,540 --> 02:57:20,979
What happened to Cooking Simulator?

2462
02:57:20,979 --> 02:57:22,819
Unfortunately, I had the release date wrong.

2463
02:57:23,620 --> 02:57:25,620
The game doesn't actually launch until tomorrow.

2464
02:57:26,840 --> 02:57:33,079
So I figured, hey, I'm just going to play Hearthstone for some reason.

2465
02:57:34,889 --> 02:57:36,729
Odd that that's the thing that decided...

2466
02:57:36,729 --> 02:57:38,170
I just felt like it.

2467
02:57:38,969 --> 02:57:41,399
And on this channel, we just do anything.

2468
02:57:42,969 --> 02:57:45,930
Even if it's to the detriment of my channel.

2469
02:57:45,930 --> 02:57:46,889
It doesn't matter.

2470
02:57:49,260 --> 02:57:51,020
Let's go with the...

2471
02:57:51,020 --> 02:57:51,659
What are you doing?

2472
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:09,590
I used to be my favorite card in the game.

2473
02:58:10,950 --> 02:58:11,750
I still love that thing.

2474
02:58:12,780 --> 02:58:13,979
Doesn't seem like a detriment.

2475
02:58:13,979 --> 02:58:15,260
No, I'm just kidding around.

2476
02:58:16,139 --> 02:58:16,700
I'm just kidding.

2477
02:58:19,719 --> 02:58:20,600
One, one.

2478
02:58:20,600 --> 02:58:22,120
And then gain his attack and armor.

2479
02:58:22,120 --> 02:58:23,239
Maybe I should do it to you.

2480
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:25,559
And get the coins and then do...

2481
02:58:27,319 --> 02:58:28,120
That's what I'm going for?

2482
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:29,719
Could be the wrong play.

2483
02:58:31,159 --> 02:58:32,120
Might be the wrong play.

2484
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:33,799
But it's what I'm going to do.

2485
02:58:47,739 --> 02:58:52,040
We have many secrets.

2486
02:58:56,090 --> 02:58:56,889
Have you ever played...

2487
02:58:56,889 --> 02:58:57,209
Tried...

2488
02:58:58,569 --> 02:58:59,370
What is...

2489
02:58:59,370 --> 02:58:59,850
I don't know.

2490
02:58:59,850 --> 02:59:00,170
What's it?

2491
02:59:01,750 --> 02:59:02,309
Hearthstone?

2492
02:59:02,309 --> 02:59:03,670
A good way to win at Hearthstone?

2493
02:59:05,180 --> 02:59:06,299
I feel like that's a...

2494
02:59:06,299 --> 02:59:07,020
Is it a thing?

2495
02:59:07,020 --> 02:59:07,979
I'm not saying that.

2496
02:59:07,979 --> 02:59:08,620
I don't know about it.

2497
02:59:10,059 --> 02:59:10,459
What am I...

2498
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:12,809
I'm not reading that.

2499
02:59:18,680 --> 02:59:19,239
It's...

2500
02:59:19,239 --> 02:59:20,280
Talk to the S.

2501
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:20,680
Okay.

2502
02:59:20,680 --> 02:59:21,479
I don't know what that is.

2503
02:59:21,479 --> 02:59:22,600
And I almost said I don't know what it is.

2504
02:59:23,799 --> 02:59:26,360
Well, that's a perfect exact mana cost card.

2505
02:59:26,920 --> 02:59:32,899
With a mage secret.

2506
02:59:32,899 --> 02:59:33,459
Oh, shit.

2507
02:59:37,700 --> 02:59:38,579
What is it?

2508
02:59:38,579 --> 02:59:40,020
It's going to be like Vaporize, right?

2509
02:59:40,659 --> 02:59:41,379
It's Vaporize.

2510
02:59:52,649 --> 02:59:53,530
So many squirrels.

2511
02:59:55,049 --> 02:59:56,250
It's not a beast?

2512
02:59:56,969 --> 02:59:57,370
Damn.

2513
02:59:58,329 --> 03:00:01,620
Twin spell?

2514
03:00:01,620 --> 03:00:02,260
No, I can't do that.

2515
03:00:09,420 --> 03:00:10,139
All squirrels?

2516
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:13,219
And then get Vaporized?

2517
03:00:14,809 --> 03:00:15,930
All squirrels and then...

2518
03:00:17,260 --> 03:00:17,659
Wait a minute.

2519
03:00:19,100 --> 03:00:20,540
And I'm loving it!

2520
03:00:20,540 --> 03:00:21,260
Holy shit.

2521
03:00:21,260 --> 03:00:21,739
Calm down.

2522
03:00:22,379 --> 03:00:28,170
Let's see what this is.

2523
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:31,319
Three...

2524
03:00:31,959 --> 03:00:32,520
Hold on.

2525
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:32,920
Hold on.

2526
03:00:33,799 --> 03:00:34,440
Four?

2527
03:00:34,440 --> 03:00:35,079
Five?

2528
03:00:35,079 --> 03:00:35,479
Four?

2529
03:00:35,479 --> 03:00:35,959
Five?

2530
03:00:35,959 --> 03:00:36,200
Six.

2531
03:00:36,920 --> 03:00:40,010
So then should I get twin spell twice on the squirrel?

2532
03:01:11,270 --> 03:01:12,389
Oh, shit!

2533
03:01:12,389 --> 03:01:13,750
You motherfucker!

2534
03:01:13,750 --> 03:01:15,190
You just ruined everything!

2535
03:01:15,190 --> 03:01:15,690
Why?

2536
03:01:19,639 --> 03:01:20,139
No!

2537
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:21,000
It's all right.

2538
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:21,559
I can do it next...

2539
03:01:21,559 --> 03:01:22,840
I can twin spell it next turn.

2540
03:01:22,840 --> 03:01:23,719
He's not going to kill all this.

2541
03:01:33,670 --> 03:01:34,309
Yeah, coining...

2542
03:01:35,270 --> 03:01:37,989
This is bad now.

2543
03:01:38,629 --> 03:01:43,340
At least I get two of them.

2544
03:01:45,879 --> 03:01:47,719
Actually, it's a good thing I didn't do this.

2545
03:01:47,719 --> 03:01:48,760
Although, man, it sucks.

2546
03:01:50,219 --> 03:01:51,100
Too bad I still...

2547
03:01:51,100 --> 03:01:52,620
I wish I had that fucking other coin.

2548
03:01:52,620 --> 03:01:53,899
I could have done Gruul this turn.

2549
03:01:53,899 --> 03:02:00,489
Oh, that's not a beat.

2550
03:02:00,489 --> 03:02:02,329
I just get the tiger out there again and then...

2551
03:02:07,959 --> 03:02:11,379
Oh, look at this loser.

2552
03:02:11,379 --> 03:02:12,020
What did you say to me?

2553
03:02:19,750 --> 03:02:21,299
I got lots of armor.

2554
03:02:22,100 --> 03:02:26,100
None of these beasts.

2555
03:02:30,260 --> 03:02:30,659
All right.

2556
03:02:30,659 --> 03:02:32,739
Coin Gruul or Coin Chromagus?

2557
03:02:33,379 --> 03:02:36,870
I'm going to say Coin Gruul.

2558
03:02:42,579 --> 03:02:47,299
And then I...

2559
03:02:47,299 --> 03:02:47,940
Ah, hold on.

2560
03:02:48,659 --> 03:02:56,950
Can I get rid of the Sorcerer's Apprentice

2561
03:02:56,950 --> 03:02:58,790
or get rid of the Karantor Mage?

2562
03:02:59,670 --> 03:03:00,549
I'm going to say Mage.

2563
03:03:05,399 --> 03:03:06,680
Or I could just hit him.

2564
03:03:06,680 --> 03:03:07,479
Hopefully that was right.

2565
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:10,180
I didn't trade.

2566
03:03:13,260 --> 03:03:15,059
Not good.

2567
03:03:16,659 --> 03:03:17,299
Should have traded.

2568
03:03:20,120 --> 03:03:21,719
I was supposed to trade,

2569
03:03:21,719 --> 03:03:23,959
and now it's going to come back and bite me.

2570
03:03:23,959 --> 03:03:29,819
Chromagus is gone.

2571
03:03:29,819 --> 03:03:30,780
I didn't get to do it once.

2572
03:03:31,579 --> 03:03:38,040
You control three menus of seven health

2573
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:39,959
and deal seven damage to all enemies.

2574
03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:43,770
Well, it's time for Gruul.

2575
03:03:51,659 --> 03:03:52,159
Ouch.

2576
03:04:03,559 --> 03:04:04,840
This is so bad.

2577
03:04:07,829 --> 03:04:09,510
Put SP in the title.

2578
03:04:09,510 --> 03:04:10,950
Or, I mean, this is not...

2579
03:04:10,950 --> 03:04:16,969
Nobody gets sponsored to play Hearthstone.

2580
03:04:16,969 --> 03:04:17,469
What?

2581
03:04:18,969 --> 03:04:21,899
I think I'm just going to go with the 777.

2582
03:04:23,670 --> 03:04:24,389
That's a lie?

2583
03:04:24,389 --> 03:04:27,350
Do people actually get sponsored by Blizzard?

2584
03:04:27,989 --> 03:04:30,819
I'm just going with seven.

2585
03:04:32,500 --> 03:04:36,709
Blizzard pays people to play this game.

2586
03:04:37,700 --> 03:04:38,500
Not like tournaments,

2587
03:04:38,500 --> 03:04:39,940
like actually just to stream it.

2588
03:04:39,940 --> 03:04:53,399
Oh, it means single player.

2589
03:05:00,139 --> 03:05:04,059
I just jumped immediately to conclusions on that one.

2590
03:05:04,620 --> 03:05:11,079
Did you use the Twitch bounty?

2591
03:05:11,079 --> 03:05:12,840
No, no, I don't, I don't, I don't.

2592
03:05:12,840 --> 03:05:15,799
No, I did this because I'm a fucking moron.

2593
03:05:15,799 --> 03:05:18,760
And this is my own dumb decision.

2594
03:05:18,760 --> 03:05:20,600
I'm going to own my own shitty decisions.

2595
03:05:21,159 --> 03:05:22,200
This is a good decision.

2596
03:05:22,840 --> 03:05:24,420
Plus, I win.

2597
03:05:24,420 --> 03:05:26,739
The game's over.

2598
03:05:26,739 --> 03:05:28,760
Eight, nine, not yet.

2599
03:05:29,399 --> 03:05:32,709
Is that a beast?

2600
03:05:36,709 --> 03:05:37,989
Do the bounty now.

2601
03:05:37,989 --> 03:05:38,790
There is no...

2602
03:05:38,790 --> 03:05:40,629
I don't have a bounty for Hearthstone.

2603
03:05:44,020 --> 03:05:46,100
How does that not have a bounty for Hearthstone?

2604
03:06:06,860 --> 03:06:10,059
Yeah, I don't have a bounty, a bounty for Hearthstone.

2605
03:06:10,059 --> 03:06:21,899
Well, I can't do this yet.

2606
03:06:21,899 --> 03:06:22,860
Oh, we get to do this.

2607
03:06:31,379 --> 03:06:35,659
Next turn, we get to win.

2608
03:06:43,659 --> 03:06:44,379
Quest?

2609
03:06:44,379 --> 03:06:45,180
That's going to be too late.

2610
03:06:46,600 --> 03:06:47,319
Why not now?

2611
03:06:49,559 --> 03:06:54,170
Nobody died?

2612
03:06:54,809 --> 03:06:55,610
Freeze an enemy?

2613
03:07:05,450 --> 03:07:06,569
Well, now I'm going to do this.

2614
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:13,079
Never mind.

2615
03:07:19,579 --> 03:07:20,620
Shuffle it back in.

2616
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:22,920
Twin spell?

2617
03:07:23,860 --> 03:07:24,979
Quest now.

2618
03:07:24,979 --> 03:07:25,780
Twin spell.

2619
03:07:25,780 --> 03:07:26,819
Make it so I stay alive.

2620
03:07:47,500 --> 03:07:48,860
No, that's too much spell damage.

2621
03:07:48,860 --> 03:07:49,739
You don't have anything in your hand.

2622
03:07:52,809 --> 03:07:53,909
Nothing.

2623
03:07:53,909 --> 03:07:54,149
Yes.

2624
03:07:55,270 --> 03:07:55,670
All right.

2625
03:07:56,309 --> 03:08:01,100
Oh, come on.

2626
03:08:01,100 --> 03:08:02,780
Hit me in the face fucking five times.

2627
03:08:06,870 --> 03:08:07,829
That was so dumb.

2628
03:08:08,790 --> 03:08:09,350
Oh, God.

2629
03:08:10,549 --> 03:08:12,069
Your minions cost one.

2630
03:08:12,069 --> 03:08:13,030
Now, well, that's good.

2631
03:08:13,590 --> 03:08:14,229
I'm glad.

2632
03:08:25,959 --> 03:08:27,479
Yeah, it's a guaranteed victory.

2633
03:08:29,959 --> 03:08:31,799
Unless you pyroblast me or something, somehow.

2634
03:08:36,040 --> 03:08:36,920
Am I going to lose?

2635
03:08:36,920 --> 03:08:37,159
No.

2636
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:38,760
I just won.

2637
03:08:44,389 --> 03:08:51,450
Oh, yeah.

2638
03:08:52,329 --> 03:08:54,569
I always have to do the BN on the computer because it doesn't matter.

2639
03:08:59,290 --> 03:09:00,329
Heroic isn't that bad.

2640
03:09:01,850 --> 03:09:06,489
The enemy's fatigued because he's so slow.

2641
03:09:06,489 --> 03:09:07,370
But I play slow.

2642
03:09:07,930 --> 03:09:09,450
What are we thinking?

2643
03:09:13,559 --> 03:09:18,120
50 damage to guaranteed win and a random one out of 30 chance.

2644
03:09:19,559 --> 03:09:23,079
Or add three random cards to your hand and they all cost zero.

2645
03:09:23,079 --> 03:09:24,440
That's fucking incredible.

2646
03:09:25,239 --> 03:09:28,620
Deal four damage to all minions and you shuffle it back in.

2647
03:09:28,620 --> 03:09:29,340
These are all good.

2648
03:09:30,059 --> 03:09:32,379
But you're going to make me pick the meme card.

2649
03:09:32,379 --> 03:09:41,260
So all enemy minions.

2650
03:09:41,260 --> 03:09:42,940
And it's a death rattle and we get it twice.

2651
03:09:42,940 --> 03:09:44,860
You really want me to do the joke card?

2652
03:09:46,059 --> 03:09:47,579
We're not going to see that the whole rest of the run.

2653
03:09:48,700 --> 03:09:56,420
Oh, goddamn it.

2654
03:09:56,420 --> 03:09:57,620
Why do the clicks do this?

2655
03:10:02,569 --> 03:10:04,010
There's been like five...

2656
03:10:04,010 --> 03:10:05,290
I'm not changing any settings.

2657
03:10:05,290 --> 03:10:07,450
There's been like 5,000 clicks.

2658
03:10:07,450 --> 03:10:08,090
You can't...

2659
03:10:08,090 --> 03:10:08,489
No.

2660
03:10:08,489 --> 03:10:09,850
Ah, whatever.

2661
03:10:09,850 --> 03:10:20,680
That's all right.

2662
03:10:20,680 --> 03:10:21,399
Elder won.

2663
03:10:22,040 --> 03:10:22,680
Yeah.

2664
03:10:22,680 --> 03:10:23,639
Elder is still winning.

2665
03:10:25,270 --> 03:10:27,190
I mean, that's amazing.

2666
03:10:29,819 --> 03:10:31,260
Or that, too, is so good.

2667
03:10:32,059 --> 03:10:32,620
All right.

2668
03:10:32,620 --> 03:10:33,979
The people have spoken.

2669
03:10:33,979 --> 03:10:38,760
The muscle is probably the best card here.

2670
03:10:39,479 --> 03:10:40,440
But Elder, that...

2671
03:10:41,159 --> 03:10:42,629
I mean, come on.

2672
03:10:42,629 --> 03:10:43,670
That's unbelievable.

2673
03:10:44,469 --> 03:10:50,680
Please continue to make your selection.

2674
03:10:50,680 --> 03:10:52,360
Big friends, pharaoh, bite, or legends?

2675
03:10:56,950 --> 03:10:57,989
Two avianas.

2676
03:10:58,549 --> 03:11:00,180
Aviana?

2677
03:11:00,180 --> 03:11:01,780
I don't really like aviana.

2678
03:11:01,780 --> 03:11:03,829
You have to wait till the very end of the game

2679
03:11:05,059 --> 03:11:09,049
to be able to throw up shit all over your board.

2680
03:11:09,049 --> 03:11:10,329
You already lost at that point.

2681
03:11:12,219 --> 03:11:13,340
Big bad arc mage.

2682
03:11:14,139 --> 03:11:18,170
That's pretty good.

2683
03:11:18,809 --> 03:11:23,620
Some of the five, five ironhide runt.

2684
03:11:24,260 --> 03:11:26,620
Two bites.

2685
03:11:26,620 --> 03:11:27,420
That's not bad either.

2686
03:11:27,420 --> 03:11:29,590
These are all good.

2687
03:11:29,590 --> 03:11:30,549
Cenarius is good.

2688
03:11:30,549 --> 03:11:31,750
Lowethep is really good.

2689
03:11:31,750 --> 03:11:32,469
I remember Lowethep.

2690
03:11:32,469 --> 03:11:33,510
He was like one of the best cards.

2691
03:11:34,149 --> 03:11:35,399
All right.

2692
03:11:35,399 --> 03:11:37,399
We're going to go with big friends.

2693
03:11:43,450 --> 03:11:44,250
Bite sucks.

2694
03:11:48,969 --> 03:11:49,850
Is bite bad?

2695
03:11:55,030 --> 03:11:55,829
Hey, welcome.

2696
03:11:56,389 --> 03:11:57,190
I can do better than that.

2697
03:11:57,190 --> 03:11:57,829
No, that's...

2698
03:11:57,829 --> 03:11:58,870
I shouldn't even...

2699
03:11:58,870 --> 03:11:59,350
Just stop.

2700
03:12:00,149 --> 03:12:00,549
Just stop.

2701
03:12:00,549 --> 03:12:01,030
You gotta...

2702
03:12:01,030 --> 03:12:02,389
Sometimes you gotta take the fucking loss.

2703
03:12:03,110 --> 03:12:07,319
What do you guys think?

2704
03:12:07,959 --> 03:12:12,040
I only get to do...

2705
03:12:12,040 --> 03:12:12,280
What?

2706
03:12:13,159 --> 03:12:14,680
I can only do...

2707
03:12:15,399 --> 03:12:20,579
Oh, it's because it's heroic.

2708
03:12:21,700 --> 03:12:24,489
Choose an enemy minion and add it to your deck

2709
03:12:24,489 --> 03:12:26,649
or give a friendly minion plus two plus two.

2710
03:12:26,649 --> 03:12:27,290
Just do them both.

2711
03:12:27,850 --> 03:12:28,409
Doesn't matter.

2712
03:12:30,420 --> 03:12:32,020
Or remove somebody from the deck.

2713
03:12:32,579 --> 03:12:36,659
I think you guys are clicking in the middle.

2714
03:12:39,399 --> 03:12:40,360
No, you're not.

2715
03:12:40,360 --> 03:12:41,719
You're doing recruit.

2716
03:12:42,360 --> 03:12:44,889
I mean, we can do them all.

2717
03:12:45,690 --> 03:12:46,940
All right.

2718
03:12:46,940 --> 03:12:47,100
Let's...

2719
03:12:47,100 --> 03:12:47,819
I'll make this easier.

2720
03:12:47,819 --> 03:12:48,940
Let me start from the left.

2721
03:12:48,940 --> 03:12:51,020
Because I mean, we're gonna probably do them all.

2722
03:12:51,020 --> 03:12:53,500
So forget about this.

2723
03:12:54,059 --> 03:12:55,020
Be easier this way.

2724
03:12:57,719 --> 03:12:57,879
So...

2725
03:13:00,440 --> 03:13:03,559
Who do you want me to recruit?

2726
03:13:03,559 --> 03:13:06,250
We've got giant anaconda.

2727
03:13:06,250 --> 03:13:07,610
Duskfallen Aviana.

2728
03:13:07,610 --> 03:13:09,610
Aviana, like evil Aviana.

2729
03:13:09,860 --> 03:13:10,819
That's like dark pit.

2730
03:13:11,940 --> 03:13:13,860
Kel'thuzad and then Ragnaros.

2731
03:13:13,860 --> 03:13:15,379
So who would you like me to do that to?

2732
03:13:15,940 --> 03:13:18,709
That's a better question.

2733
03:13:18,709 --> 03:13:20,469
How to beat you?

2734
03:13:20,469 --> 03:13:28,139
And no, I cannot take the innkeeper.

2735
03:13:28,139 --> 03:13:42,469
Seems to be a split between Kel'thuzad and Ragnaros

2736
03:13:42,469 --> 03:13:45,399
and the innkeeper because I said the word.

2737
03:13:45,399 --> 03:13:50,579
I said the word innkeeper and everyone's like hand

2738
03:13:50,579 --> 03:13:58,170
just Ouija board over to his face.

2739
03:13:58,170 --> 03:13:59,610
So it looks like it's gonna be Kel'thuzad.

2740
03:14:00,569 --> 03:14:01,049
All right.

2741
03:14:01,930 --> 03:14:03,959
Thank you for voting.

2742
03:14:04,600 --> 03:14:09,770
Kel'thuzad is coming with us.

2743
03:14:10,409 --> 03:14:14,809
All right.

2744
03:14:14,809 --> 03:14:16,809
Now, who do you want me to give?

2745
03:14:16,809 --> 03:14:21,860
Plus one, plus one, two.

2746
03:14:21,860 --> 03:14:24,250
Well, plus...

2747
03:14:24,250 --> 03:14:25,049
No, who do you want to get?

2748
03:14:25,049 --> 03:14:27,209
Plus two, plus two, two.

2749
03:14:27,209 --> 03:14:40,549
Who do you want me to give plus two, plus two, two?

2750
03:14:40,549 --> 03:14:41,829
Feral gib?

2751
03:14:42,389 --> 03:14:43,780
Astral tiger.

2752
03:14:43,780 --> 03:14:45,540
I mean, that's three, three, one drop.

2753
03:14:45,540 --> 03:14:46,260
That's pretty good.

2754
03:14:46,899 --> 03:14:55,620
That would also be a five, seven astral tiger,

2755
03:14:55,620 --> 03:14:56,340
which is insane.

2756
03:15:02,040 --> 03:15:02,920
Three, three, one drop.

2757
03:15:02,920 --> 03:15:04,200
That multiplies.

2758
03:15:04,200 --> 03:15:04,760
Yeah, that's true.

2759
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:05,399
That's really good.

2760
03:15:06,629 --> 03:15:07,270
All right.

2761
03:15:07,270 --> 03:15:11,750
For the story before, it's a good one.

2762
03:15:11,750 --> 03:15:12,780
Okay.

2763
03:15:13,579 --> 03:15:14,780
Do you want me to remove anyone?

2764
03:15:15,340 --> 03:15:20,059
Do we still want to do that?

2765
03:15:22,729 --> 03:15:23,209
You know, let's...

2766
03:15:23,209 --> 03:15:23,690
Okay, click.

2767
03:15:23,690 --> 03:15:24,090
You know, who...

2768
03:15:25,129 --> 03:15:26,090
Are we removing anybody?

2769
03:15:28,569 --> 03:15:29,290
I don't think so.

2770
03:15:29,930 --> 03:15:30,649
I don't think so.

2771
03:15:32,809 --> 03:15:34,729
I think these, they all have a place here.

2772
03:15:35,290 --> 03:15:36,579
The death rattles.

2773
03:15:36,579 --> 03:15:37,219
No, we can't...

2774
03:15:37,219 --> 03:15:38,659
No, I'm not getting rid of any of these.

2775
03:15:39,909 --> 03:15:42,069
I'm not gonna remove me.

2776
03:15:43,030 --> 03:15:45,190
Replace the streamer with a better streamer.

2777
03:15:50,600 --> 03:15:51,159
No, we're good.

2778
03:15:51,799 --> 03:15:52,920
These are all death rattles.

2779
03:15:54,889 --> 03:15:55,850
Why won't it work?

2780
03:15:56,489 --> 03:16:00,139
Let's go.

2781
03:16:08,309 --> 03:16:10,950
Once you say it, Twitch repeats it.

2782
03:16:16,219 --> 03:16:19,340
Whenever a player plays a coin, draw a card.

2783
03:16:19,979 --> 03:16:23,129
I'm gonna forget about that.

2784
03:16:23,129 --> 03:16:24,569
I'm gonna give him so much money.

2785
03:16:25,290 --> 03:16:38,219
I just realized...

2786
03:16:38,860 --> 03:16:45,639
These kobolds just look like human skin alligators.

2787
03:16:46,120 --> 03:16:54,010
It's weird, right?

2788
03:16:54,010 --> 03:16:56,280
All right, I don't want that.

2789
03:16:58,489 --> 03:17:00,649
We're gonna actually hold on to the quest this time.

2790
03:17:00,649 --> 03:17:02,329
Give me some low cost, please.

2791
03:17:11,190 --> 03:17:11,750
That's okay.

2792
03:17:13,290 --> 03:17:14,170
All right.

2793
03:17:14,170 --> 03:17:16,979
Whenever a player plays a coin, draw a card.

2794
03:17:17,620 --> 03:17:22,979
So I'm assuming he's gonna give me coins.

2795
03:17:26,659 --> 03:17:27,459
Definitely gonna do this.

2796
03:17:31,459 --> 03:17:34,899
I think I popped the treasure once.

2797
03:17:40,899 --> 03:17:42,899
Is this guy gonna play a card?

2798
03:17:46,780 --> 03:17:47,340
There it is.

2799
03:17:48,059 --> 03:17:50,420
Why would you play that now?

2800
03:17:51,459 --> 03:17:51,860
It's gone.

2801
03:17:55,959 --> 03:17:56,200
Right?

2802
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:57,639
Why would you do that?

2803
03:18:09,190 --> 03:18:09,510
Shit!

2804
03:18:18,309 --> 03:18:19,670
He's gonna give me two coins.

2805
03:18:25,290 --> 03:18:25,850
Send it back.

2806
03:18:28,090 --> 03:18:28,729
I'll take the coins.

2807
03:18:28,729 --> 03:18:29,530
I don't give a shit.

2808
03:18:29,530 --> 03:18:30,090
Send it back.

2809
03:18:31,819 --> 03:18:35,959
I gotta get two of them.

2810
03:18:35,959 --> 03:18:41,510
Look at all that.

2811
03:18:51,159 --> 03:18:51,959
No, I'm not gonna coin.

2812
03:18:55,799 --> 03:18:59,989
This guy's dead right now.

2813
03:19:01,750 --> 03:19:02,709
It's all right.

2814
03:19:03,819 --> 03:19:05,420
I'm gonna coin out Gruul.

2815
03:19:05,420 --> 03:19:06,620
I'm putting Gruul out right now.

2816
03:19:11,340 --> 03:19:16,139
Or coin out bone mare and give the taunt to the astral tiger.

2817
03:19:23,049 --> 03:19:23,610
I like that.

2818
03:19:24,489 --> 03:19:25,209
That sounds fun.

2819
03:19:27,100 --> 03:19:28,540
I can still kill questing adventure.

2820
03:19:31,719 --> 03:19:33,879
The coins are gonna grow questing.

2821
03:19:33,879 --> 03:19:34,200
Fuck.

2822
03:19:46,649 --> 03:19:47,129
They don't?

2823
03:19:52,180 --> 03:19:53,139
I was the one guy.

2824
03:19:53,139 --> 03:19:54,180
I was listening to the one guy.

2825
03:19:55,059 --> 03:19:56,139
Let's do this.

2826
03:20:00,520 --> 03:20:02,360
And I can kill questing and be fine.

2827
03:20:03,239 --> 03:20:03,559
All right.

2828
03:20:03,559 --> 03:20:04,440
Now we're in a good spot.

2829
03:20:13,190 --> 03:20:18,620
I'll take two tigers.

2830
03:20:21,319 --> 03:20:22,040
Overkill.

2831
03:20:22,920 --> 03:20:26,100
Well there's the big bad archmage.

2832
03:20:30,840 --> 03:20:36,260
I could do scribe or I could hit and kill

2833
03:20:42,100 --> 03:20:43,540
or bring out the direhorm.

2834
03:20:49,639 --> 03:20:50,920
Yeah, let's direhorm face.

2835
03:20:51,559 --> 03:21:03,930
And we get a coin.

2836
03:21:05,129 --> 03:21:06,010
Oh, fuck you.

2837
03:21:09,239 --> 03:21:09,559
Okay.

2838
03:21:13,750 --> 03:21:16,420
I think I gotta bring out Gruul.

2839
03:21:16,420 --> 03:21:17,379
I think I have to.

2840
03:21:18,760 --> 03:21:19,559
Or the scribe.

2841
03:21:20,280 --> 03:21:29,260
I can kill that with this, but then...

2842
03:21:30,459 --> 03:21:32,440
Yeah, we'll do this.

2843
03:21:34,440 --> 03:21:38,569
I have too many coins.

2844
03:21:38,569 --> 03:21:39,530
I need to get rid of these.

2845
03:21:50,229 --> 03:21:51,270
What did you just do?

2846
03:21:51,270 --> 03:21:51,909
What did he just do?

2847
03:21:51,909 --> 03:21:52,549
Did he vanish?

2848
03:21:52,549 --> 03:21:53,430
Why did you vanish?

2849
03:21:53,989 --> 03:21:54,870
This is heroic.

2850
03:21:57,989 --> 03:21:59,750
This is on heroic.

2851
03:21:59,750 --> 03:22:01,110
Oh, please.

2852
03:22:01,110 --> 03:22:02,149
Oh, please.

2853
03:22:03,860 --> 03:22:05,219
Oh, please.

2854
03:22:06,020 --> 03:22:07,059
I don't even care.

2855
03:22:17,030 --> 03:22:18,309
And here comes Barnum.

2856
03:22:25,209 --> 03:22:31,719
I didn't even know what was happening.

2857
03:22:33,239 --> 03:22:34,200
He summons...

2858
03:22:34,200 --> 03:22:36,120
Oh, he summons six cost minions.

2859
03:22:43,059 --> 03:22:44,739
Uh-oh, you had to get rid of Aviana.

2860
03:22:45,459 --> 03:22:48,540
It doesn't matter.

2861
03:22:50,700 --> 03:22:52,860
Reduce the cost of your minions in your deck to zero.

2862
03:22:53,579 --> 03:22:55,100
That's so stupid.

2863
03:22:58,260 --> 03:22:59,059
I mean, like, let's...

2864
03:22:59,700 --> 03:23:00,020
Okay.

2865
03:23:06,940 --> 03:23:07,659
Do I just win?

2866
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:09,340
I just win.

2867
03:23:09,979 --> 03:23:11,899
But I want to see that, though.

2868
03:23:11,899 --> 03:23:12,379
That's fun.

2869
03:23:13,299 --> 03:23:14,579
I'll take him down to one health.

2870
03:23:21,559 --> 03:23:27,079
Yeah, that's dangerous.

2871
03:23:27,079 --> 03:23:27,559
Never mind.

2872
03:23:30,379 --> 03:23:31,659
Yeah, this is heroic.

2873
03:23:32,459 --> 03:23:32,780
I can't...

2874
03:23:32,780 --> 03:23:33,579
I don't want to fuck around.

2875
03:23:34,459 --> 03:23:39,379
That was awesome.

2876
03:23:40,469 --> 03:23:41,190
Just like that.

2877
03:23:41,190 --> 03:23:43,190
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

2878
03:23:43,190 --> 03:23:44,069
That's what you live for.

2879
03:23:52,760 --> 03:23:53,319
Roar.

2880
03:23:53,319 --> 03:23:54,920
Beasts and buffs are big friends again.

2881
03:23:55,479 --> 03:24:02,870
Another Dire Horn.

2882
03:24:02,870 --> 03:24:04,729
Malorne.

2883
03:24:04,729 --> 03:24:06,090
That's just double.

2884
03:24:06,889 --> 03:24:08,170
Rush, overkill.

2885
03:24:08,170 --> 03:24:09,290
Summon a beast from your hand.

2886
03:24:09,290 --> 03:24:10,489
I don't really have any beasts.

2887
03:24:10,489 --> 03:24:11,370
I mean, I guess maybe.

2888
03:24:16,020 --> 03:24:18,739
Adapt means that every turn you get to do something else, right?

2889
03:24:18,739 --> 03:24:19,459
Or every...

2890
03:24:19,459 --> 03:24:23,139
You just change it to, like, divine shield, taunt, rush, right?

2891
03:24:23,700 --> 03:24:28,680
I do have a ton of beasts.

2892
03:24:28,680 --> 03:24:29,399
I guess I do.

2893
03:24:29,399 --> 03:24:29,799
All right.

2894
03:24:29,799 --> 03:24:30,360
Sounds good.

2895
03:24:37,129 --> 03:24:38,409
Banker Biggs.

2896
03:24:39,290 --> 03:24:42,520
Return a friendly minion to your hand.

2897
03:24:42,520 --> 03:24:45,879
Then give it plus four, plus four, and copy it.

2898
03:24:48,840 --> 03:24:50,520
That sounds kind of ridiculous.

2899
03:24:51,319 --> 03:25:01,540
How the hell are you supposed to deal with that?

2900
03:25:17,979 --> 03:25:18,540
Just play it.

2901
03:25:21,799 --> 03:25:22,040
Shit.

2902
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:25,000
Oh, that's a disgusting, awful start.

2903
03:25:28,739 --> 03:25:29,700
Oh, yuck.

2904
03:25:29,700 --> 03:25:30,100
I lose.

2905
03:25:38,420 --> 03:25:41,299
I want to start really making money.

2906
03:25:41,299 --> 03:25:42,659
I'm calling security.

2907
03:25:44,149 --> 03:25:44,469
What?

2908
03:25:44,469 --> 03:25:44,790
What?

2909
03:25:44,790 --> 03:25:45,110
I didn't...

2910
03:25:45,110 --> 03:25:46,229
Why would you call security on me?

2911
03:25:46,229 --> 03:25:46,790
I didn't do anything.

2912
03:25:46,790 --> 03:25:47,350
This is bad.

2913
03:25:52,709 --> 03:25:53,510
I need these coins.

2914
03:25:54,389 --> 03:25:55,670
If I have my stand any chance.

2915
03:26:03,500 --> 03:26:04,219
I don't stand a chance.

2916
03:26:04,219 --> 03:26:05,180
I need the coins right now.

2917
03:26:06,649 --> 03:26:06,969
Die.

2918
03:26:07,610 --> 03:26:17,690
It's invader zoom.

2919
03:26:23,319 --> 03:26:23,639
All right.

2920
03:26:25,049 --> 03:26:26,010
Two and one.

2921
03:26:26,010 --> 03:26:26,969
No, that's bad.

2922
03:26:26,969 --> 03:26:27,850
That's not gonna work.

2923
03:26:27,850 --> 03:26:28,969
I have to just get the coins.

2924
03:26:32,500 --> 03:26:33,059
Or I could...

2925
03:26:39,799 --> 03:26:40,920
Tiger's not terrible here.

2926
03:26:41,559 --> 03:26:43,319
This is a gamble, but it might be all right.

2927
03:27:11,159 --> 03:27:12,760
Literally, what did that accomplish?

2928
03:27:12,760 --> 03:27:13,159
I don't...

2929
03:27:14,520 --> 03:27:15,239
Nothing.

2930
03:27:15,239 --> 03:27:16,280
I don't know why.

2931
03:27:16,280 --> 03:27:17,239
I just...

2932
03:27:17,239 --> 03:27:17,479
Some...

2933
03:27:17,479 --> 03:27:19,239
I looked over and I saw somebody say it.

2934
03:27:19,959 --> 03:27:20,440
No, I don't...

2935
03:27:20,440 --> 03:27:21,399
I can't use the coins enough.

2936
03:27:21,399 --> 03:27:22,200
Fuck.

2937
03:27:22,200 --> 03:27:24,139
I have to put something out here.

2938
03:27:31,370 --> 03:27:32,090
It was me.

2939
03:27:33,450 --> 03:27:34,170
What the fuck?

2940
03:27:35,379 --> 03:27:38,979
I forgot there's people that are writing things specifically.

2941
03:27:38,979 --> 03:27:40,500
So I'll look at it and then they'll go.

2942
03:27:40,500 --> 03:27:41,700
You might do it.

2943
03:27:41,700 --> 03:27:43,780
Oh, I need to focus on me.

2944
03:27:47,610 --> 03:27:49,770
Literally, what did that accomplish?

2945
03:27:49,770 --> 03:27:50,489
You're right.

2946
03:27:50,489 --> 03:27:50,969
Damn it.

2947
03:27:52,120 --> 03:27:52,440
Okay.

2948
03:27:53,989 --> 03:27:54,389
This is...

2949
03:27:55,750 --> 03:27:57,989
That's the best card in the whole game, right?

2950
03:27:59,459 --> 03:28:01,459
Isn't that the best current card?

2951
03:28:01,459 --> 03:28:02,819
Like the broken meta card?

2952
03:28:06,950 --> 03:28:08,389
Okay, I have two coins.

2953
03:28:09,590 --> 03:28:10,069
Seven.

2954
03:28:10,069 --> 03:28:14,600
I could do four and then twin spell them.

2955
03:28:14,600 --> 03:28:15,159
No.

2956
03:28:15,159 --> 03:28:16,040
I could do tiger.

2957
03:28:16,840 --> 03:28:26,200
Come on.

2958
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:30,329
Was I gonna like draw that next?

2959
03:28:30,329 --> 03:28:31,610
Why do I keep pulling this?

2960
03:28:32,250 --> 03:28:41,219
I have to like coin and hit this.

2961
03:28:43,860 --> 03:28:45,989
Right?

2962
03:28:45,989 --> 03:28:47,510
I mean like this is horrible.

2963
03:28:57,270 --> 03:29:00,579
No, I mean just it takes the shield off.

2964
03:29:00,579 --> 03:29:02,420
So I don't get guaranteed.

2965
03:29:05,100 --> 03:29:05,819
I would do that.

2966
03:29:06,940 --> 03:29:07,739
That's what I would do.

2967
03:29:08,620 --> 03:29:09,260
That's what you would do.

2968
03:29:09,260 --> 03:29:10,459
I think that's what I would do as well.

2969
03:29:15,850 --> 03:29:16,409
Go face.

2970
03:29:16,409 --> 03:29:16,969
I don't...

2971
03:29:16,969 --> 03:29:17,530
I can't.

2972
03:29:17,530 --> 03:29:18,569
Oh, this is so bad.

2973
03:29:20,329 --> 03:29:20,809
Uh-oh.

2974
03:29:26,760 --> 03:29:28,600
Anonymous five community subs.

2975
03:29:28,600 --> 03:29:29,000
Thank you.

2976
03:29:30,149 --> 03:29:33,989
There were an insane amount of community subs tonight.

2977
03:29:33,989 --> 03:29:35,750
And somebody else just gave five more.

2978
03:29:38,579 --> 03:29:40,260
Thank you so much for the subs.

2979
03:29:43,239 --> 03:29:44,680
What the hell am I gonna do about this?

2980
03:29:45,319 --> 03:29:47,350
Chromagus?

2981
03:29:48,069 --> 03:29:56,520
Chromagus is probably the best thing I can do.

2982
03:30:04,899 --> 03:30:05,860
Or I could do...

2983
03:30:05,860 --> 03:30:07,940
I could wait, but I'm gonna take so much damage.

2984
03:30:09,690 --> 03:30:10,889
Next turn bring this out.

2985
03:30:10,889 --> 03:30:12,809
Kill somebody and summon Chromagus.

2986
03:30:15,340 --> 03:30:16,780
I'm just gonna have to pop the shield.

2987
03:30:19,959 --> 03:30:20,760
Pop shield.

2988
03:30:22,629 --> 03:30:23,190
Kill you.

2989
03:30:24,579 --> 03:30:25,700
Bring out the tiger.

2990
03:30:26,420 --> 03:30:32,540
Should I maybe just...

2991
03:30:32,540 --> 03:30:32,780
No.

2992
03:30:37,559 --> 03:30:38,040
That's the...

2993
03:30:38,040 --> 03:30:39,159
That's the dream right there.

2994
03:30:39,159 --> 03:30:39,719
If I can get it.

2995
03:30:44,100 --> 03:30:45,219
I need to draw that.

2996
03:30:45,940 --> 03:30:46,340
Right now.

2997
03:30:46,899 --> 03:30:48,420
That clears up everything.

2998
03:30:56,040 --> 03:30:56,440
Draw it.

2999
03:30:56,440 --> 03:30:56,760
Come on.

3000
03:30:57,399 --> 03:30:58,920
Top deck that cra...

3001
03:30:58,920 --> 03:31:00,120
Top deck the elder right now.

3002
03:31:00,760 --> 03:31:02,520
Top deck elder right now and I still have a chance.

3003
03:31:03,319 --> 03:31:07,799
Does that change things?

3004
03:31:07,799 --> 03:31:08,280
That might.

3005
03:31:09,239 --> 03:31:09,739
Ugh.

3006
03:31:10,969 --> 03:31:12,170
Coin bone mare?

3007
03:31:14,389 --> 03:31:21,399
Or coin coin rush into like you pull out...

3008
03:31:21,799 --> 03:31:30,139
Astro Rat.

3009
03:31:30,139 --> 03:31:31,899
I'll get Chromagus or Ironhide.

3010
03:31:32,459 --> 03:31:45,799
Just looking up your account number.

3011
03:31:57,000 --> 03:31:57,959
Who do I kill with this?

3012
03:31:58,680 --> 03:32:01,899
The 2-4 or the 4-3?

3013
03:32:01,899 --> 03:32:03,299
What?

3014
03:32:03,299 --> 03:32:04,180
Just go face.

3015
03:32:04,180 --> 03:32:05,219
You can't go face with the rush.

3016
03:32:05,780 --> 03:32:20,819
All right.

3017
03:32:20,819 --> 03:32:21,620
I got a chance.

3018
03:32:21,620 --> 03:32:22,979
Next turn I do...

3019
03:32:22,979 --> 03:32:23,700
This is all right.

3020
03:32:34,540 --> 03:32:37,100
Now we pull out bone mare and we go face.

3021
03:32:37,819 --> 03:32:38,889
Oh shit.

3022
03:32:38,889 --> 03:32:40,010
That thing's gonna have 4-4.

3023
03:32:40,010 --> 03:32:41,049
That's just gonna be horrible.

3024
03:32:41,049 --> 03:32:41,610
I gotta...

3025
03:32:41,610 --> 03:32:42,809
I have to start doing something now.

3026
03:32:50,229 --> 03:32:51,110
I mean, uh...

3027
03:32:54,600 --> 03:32:55,799
I gotta just go for the win.

3028
03:32:56,360 --> 03:32:57,159
And then I can do...

3029
03:32:57,719 --> 03:32:58,520
I can do this.

3030
03:32:59,559 --> 03:33:01,559
Oh no!

3031
03:33:03,559 --> 03:33:04,840
That's not good.

3032
03:33:04,840 --> 03:33:06,040
This is not good.

3033
03:33:06,040 --> 03:33:06,840
What can I get from this?

3034
03:33:12,629 --> 03:33:14,709
All right.

3035
03:33:14,709 --> 03:33:15,430
12, 13...

3036
03:33:16,149 --> 03:33:21,959
I can get a shitload of armor.

3037
03:33:33,030 --> 03:33:37,819
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

3038
03:33:39,799 --> 03:33:40,520
Is it lethal?

3039
03:34:03,219 --> 03:34:04,100
3, 6.

3040
03:34:07,620 --> 03:34:09,059
I have to put chromagus out now

3041
03:34:09,059 --> 03:34:10,420
because I fucking didn't do it right.

3042
03:34:11,299 --> 03:34:24,579
That's 3, 6, 9, twin spell.

3043
03:34:24,579 --> 03:34:25,940
I have to clear somebody.

3044
03:34:30,229 --> 03:34:31,510
No, I can do it.

3045
03:34:31,510 --> 03:34:32,149
I can do it.

3046
03:34:37,190 --> 03:34:39,110
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

3047
03:34:39,110 --> 03:34:39,350
Don't...

3048
03:34:40,149 --> 03:34:40,389
No!

3049
03:34:41,430 --> 03:34:41,989
Hold on!

3050
03:34:42,549 --> 03:34:43,030
Hold on!

3051
03:34:47,110 --> 03:34:47,510
All right.

3052
03:34:47,510 --> 03:34:48,229
Now draw.

3053
03:34:49,959 --> 03:34:53,639
Can I do it?

3054
03:34:53,639 --> 03:34:55,319
Oh, you motherfucker.

3055
03:34:55,319 --> 03:34:57,000
If only he was the elder.

3056
03:34:57,000 --> 03:34:57,479
Hold on.

3057
03:34:58,790 --> 03:35:02,440
6, 7, 8, 9...

3058
03:35:04,540 --> 03:35:04,940
9...

3059
03:35:05,979 --> 03:35:06,459
No!

3060
03:35:06,459 --> 03:35:07,340
It's not enough.

3061
03:35:16,659 --> 03:35:17,540
Go for the roll.

3062
03:35:29,059 --> 03:35:29,459
Shit!

3063
03:35:32,149 --> 03:35:33,510
Oh no!

3064
03:35:33,510 --> 03:35:34,389
I had a chance.

3065
03:35:34,950 --> 03:35:35,510
You know what?

3066
03:35:35,510 --> 03:35:37,590
Fuck the RNG I got in the beginning.

3067
03:35:37,590 --> 03:35:39,110
I pulled the elder twice.

3068
03:35:54,889 --> 03:35:55,370
Wait a minute.

3069
03:35:55,370 --> 03:35:56,010
Wait a minute.

3070
03:35:56,010 --> 03:35:56,409
Wait a minute.

3071
03:35:56,409 --> 03:35:56,969
Do I get...

3072
03:35:56,969 --> 03:35:57,209
Hold on.

3073
03:35:57,209 --> 03:35:57,690
Do I live?

3074
03:35:58,250 --> 03:35:59,610
Do I live one more turn?

3075
03:36:01,479 --> 03:36:03,639
6, 12, 18...

3076
03:36:03,639 --> 03:36:04,520
Fuck you, game.

3077
03:36:05,159 --> 03:36:10,409
Oh, there he is.

3078
03:36:11,129 --> 03:36:11,850
Wait.

3079
03:36:11,850 --> 03:36:12,729
What?

3080
03:36:12,729 --> 03:36:15,020
I need him to die.

3081
03:36:15,020 --> 03:36:18,889
Maybe he'll be an idiot.

3082
03:36:18,889 --> 03:36:41,399
Maybe he won't kill me.

3083
03:36:41,399 --> 03:36:42,040
Damn it.

3084
03:36:42,040 --> 03:36:43,639
It was this thing that screwed me.

3085
03:36:43,639 --> 03:36:44,600
That's why I had to get rid of him.

3086
03:36:44,600 --> 03:36:45,000
Oh well.

3087
03:36:56,659 --> 03:36:58,420
Oh, I have to beat it.

3088
03:36:58,420 --> 03:36:59,139
I have to do it.

3089
03:36:59,860 --> 03:37:07,639
No, wait.

3090
03:37:07,639 --> 03:37:08,520
What's the tavern roll?

3091
03:37:18,940 --> 03:37:20,139
Nefarion Rises?

3092
03:37:21,479 --> 03:37:22,040
Oh no.

3093
03:37:36,780 --> 03:37:37,899
All right, let's do Anomaly.

3094
03:37:38,620 --> 03:37:40,180
Where is it?

3095
03:37:40,739 --> 03:37:41,459
Oh.

3096
03:37:41,459 --> 03:37:43,819
Which one of these is it?

3097
03:37:45,139 --> 03:37:46,100
Is it this one?

3098
03:37:46,100 --> 03:37:49,270
Which one of these is Anomaly?

3099
03:37:49,270 --> 03:37:52,700
Oh, it's above go.

3100
03:37:54,940 --> 03:37:55,739
Anomaly mode.

3101
03:37:55,739 --> 03:37:58,459
Gain a random effect for this run.

3102
03:37:58,459 --> 03:38:01,420
Minions gain plus 1 plus 1 at the end of their owner's turn.

3103
03:38:02,139 --> 03:38:05,940
So it was just random every time?

3104
03:38:06,579 --> 03:38:11,260
That makes it easy, right?

3105
03:38:11,260 --> 03:38:12,620
Ah, I don't want to do that.

3106
03:38:12,620 --> 03:38:21,750
It's random every run.

3107
03:38:22,309 --> 03:38:23,530
Anomaly is a little easier.

3108
03:38:24,250 --> 03:38:28,100
It works for them.

3109
03:38:28,100 --> 03:38:29,459
All minions get it.

3110
03:38:29,459 --> 03:38:30,260
Oh shit.

3111
03:38:30,260 --> 03:38:30,760
Okay.

3112
03:38:36,200 --> 03:38:36,760
Let's try...

3113
03:38:37,879 --> 03:38:39,879
Let's try that.

3114
03:38:39,879 --> 03:38:41,639
Let's do Heroic on here.

3115
03:38:41,639 --> 03:38:43,510
Let's pick a new class.

3116
03:39:08,280 --> 03:39:09,079
Mage.

3117
03:39:10,809 --> 03:39:12,170
Sounds good to me.

3118
03:39:12,170 --> 03:39:15,930
Gonna be Fireman.

3119
03:39:15,930 --> 03:39:19,639
Okay.

3120
03:39:19,639 --> 03:39:20,200
Easy enough.

3121
03:39:20,200 --> 03:39:28,780
Thank you.

3122
03:39:28,780 --> 03:39:29,500
Fire Blast.

3123
03:39:30,819 --> 03:39:32,020
Can only do Apprentice.

3124
03:39:32,579 --> 03:39:35,510
What's my favorite class?

3125
03:39:35,510 --> 03:39:38,549
It was Paladin when I played years ago.

3126
03:39:39,190 --> 03:39:44,489
All right, Alchemist Wendy.

3127
03:39:44,489 --> 03:39:45,290
We did this already.

3128
03:39:52,059 --> 03:39:55,350
The deck that I used to play when I attempted...

3129
03:39:55,989 --> 03:40:02,040
...was the Silverhand Knight deck.

3130
03:40:03,479 --> 03:40:07,479
Where you had that guy that gave everybody 3-3 and it was pretty fun.

3131
03:40:09,299 --> 03:40:09,620
All right.

3132
03:40:10,659 --> 03:40:11,620
This is different stuff.

3133
03:40:15,979 --> 03:40:16,540
Sickening.

3134
03:40:18,120 --> 03:40:19,399
Yeah, it was Agro Pally, right?

3135
03:40:20,040 --> 03:40:25,430
So this one, this was in there.

3136
03:40:26,870 --> 03:40:28,149
Your Murlocs cost 1.

3137
03:40:30,709 --> 03:40:32,139
Draw two cards.

3138
03:40:32,459 --> 03:40:34,299
Uh, destroy it.

3139
03:40:37,559 --> 03:40:38,040
That's fine.

3140
03:40:44,409 --> 03:40:47,610
Was that the deck that was so used that bots could get a high rank with it?

3141
03:40:47,610 --> 03:40:48,170
I don't know.

3142
03:40:54,629 --> 03:40:55,110
It was.

3143
03:40:57,610 --> 03:40:58,090
Whatever.

3144
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:02,040
Deal 2 damage.

3145
03:41:02,040 --> 03:41:03,559
Add a 1-1 elemental.

3146
03:41:03,559 --> 03:41:04,840
I'm gonna say we just get the...

3147
03:41:05,719 --> 03:41:07,819
Could just kill it.

3148
03:41:07,819 --> 03:41:09,540
Or bring out the Fairy Dragon.

3149
03:41:11,209 --> 03:41:13,690
I would put out the Fairy Dragon right here.

3150
03:41:16,579 --> 03:41:17,700
Or I would do that and skip.

3151
03:41:18,420 --> 03:41:21,620
No, it was Secret Paladin.

3152
03:41:21,620 --> 03:41:22,260
Yeah.

3153
03:41:22,260 --> 03:41:23,059
That wasn't that one.

3154
03:41:24,489 --> 03:41:25,690
Uh...

3155
03:41:25,690 --> 03:41:36,979
Chaos.

3156
03:41:36,979 --> 03:41:37,379
Chaos.

3157
03:41:37,379 --> 03:41:38,260
Why are you saying chaos?

3158
03:41:39,540 --> 03:41:47,219
Oh, because of Jebel.

3159
03:41:48,579 --> 03:41:50,940
One more turn and I get Scargill.

3160
03:41:51,579 --> 03:41:57,829
Well, I can do...

3161
03:42:03,450 --> 03:42:04,170
Eh.

3162
03:42:04,170 --> 03:42:05,260
Eh.

3163
03:42:09,639 --> 03:42:10,920
I would just kill him and hit him in the face.

3164
03:42:12,440 --> 03:42:14,040
Or you could do Salus to Secret and...

3165
03:42:15,079 --> 03:42:16,520
I can whack him, you know?

3166
03:42:36,379 --> 03:42:41,209
Thanks for the dubs.

3167
03:42:42,010 --> 03:42:43,049
Thanks for the doubles.

3168
03:42:45,459 --> 03:42:46,180
Stupid.

3169
03:42:47,219 --> 03:42:50,309
Now that gets me this for free.

3170
03:42:51,110 --> 03:43:01,049
Free 2 damage, but does that really do much for me?

3171
03:43:01,049 --> 03:43:02,729
I got my dubs!

3172
03:43:02,729 --> 03:43:03,370
Doubles!

3173
03:43:04,010 --> 03:43:09,799
That didn't really do much for me, though.

3174
03:43:19,159 --> 03:43:20,520
I mean, like, fucking die.

3175
03:43:20,520 --> 03:43:21,000
Who cares?

3176
03:43:25,450 --> 03:43:26,329
Checked.

3177
03:43:26,329 --> 03:43:27,879
Check him.

3178
03:43:27,879 --> 03:43:29,000
What does checked mean?

3179
03:43:30,040 --> 03:43:30,840
Like, checkmate?

3180
03:43:32,120 --> 03:43:32,360
Yeah.

3181
03:43:33,500 --> 03:43:34,620
Checkmate, motherfucker.

3182
03:43:35,260 --> 03:43:37,209
Does that suck?

3183
03:43:40,170 --> 03:43:42,680
Am I gonna lose?

3184
03:43:43,479 --> 03:43:48,200
No.

3185
03:43:48,200 --> 03:43:48,760
Earthen Ring.

3186
03:44:06,489 --> 03:44:06,969
What's that?

3187
03:44:07,610 --> 03:44:10,760
Whenever your spells deal damage, restore that much health to your hero.

3188
03:44:17,639 --> 03:44:22,219
Okay.

3189
03:44:22,219 --> 03:44:26,840
Well, we're gonna polymorph you.

3190
03:44:27,799 --> 03:44:29,850
And then we're gonna kill you.

3191
03:44:31,340 --> 03:44:32,540
Just like this, I'll show you.

3192
03:44:32,540 --> 03:44:33,899
It's gonna be so easy.

3193
03:44:36,219 --> 03:44:37,180
What am I doing?

3194
03:44:37,180 --> 03:44:37,979
Yeah, that's what I want to do.

3195
03:44:52,219 --> 03:44:52,540
Freeze.

3196
03:44:52,540 --> 03:45:01,659
I can do it too.

3197
03:45:02,379 --> 03:45:02,620
See?

3198
03:45:04,709 --> 03:45:05,350
I'm gonna lose.

3199
03:45:06,229 --> 03:45:10,069
No, I'm not.

3200
03:45:10,069 --> 03:45:16,700
It's Calcigos!

3201
03:45:17,340 --> 03:45:19,260
Your first spell each turn costs zero.

3202
03:45:21,139 --> 03:45:22,260
Uh, I want this.

3203
03:45:22,260 --> 03:45:26,020
It's impossible to lose at this point.

3204
03:45:27,670 --> 03:45:28,870
Let me tell you something.

3205
03:45:33,110 --> 03:45:33,750
It's possible.

3206
03:45:41,879 --> 03:45:43,290
It's possible.

3207
03:45:43,290 --> 03:45:44,809
It's very possible now.

3208
03:45:45,850 --> 03:45:51,000
Well, actually not anymore.

3209
03:45:51,000 --> 03:45:52,440
Yeah, it's not possible anymore.

3210
03:46:05,020 --> 03:46:05,739
You can't hurt me.

3211
03:46:05,739 --> 03:46:06,379
I'm immune.

3212
03:46:10,870 --> 03:46:12,389
Wait, I want him to die.

3213
03:46:12,389 --> 03:46:12,870
Watch this.

3214
03:46:13,670 --> 03:46:23,639
Level up.

3215
03:46:23,639 --> 03:46:25,319
And I got a golden mirror image.

3216
03:46:25,319 --> 03:46:32,069
Cool.

3217
03:46:32,069 --> 03:46:32,950
Some good ones here.

3218
03:46:33,590 --> 03:46:41,819
Play Classic WoW.

3219
03:46:41,819 --> 03:46:43,860
I don't have access to it.

3220
03:46:43,860 --> 03:46:47,850
I told you guys that eventually when I got access to it,

3221
03:46:49,450 --> 03:46:52,010
I was gonna try to just beat Molten Core with Chat.

3222
03:46:52,649 --> 03:46:55,700
But I mean, that would take months.

3223
03:46:56,420 --> 03:46:58,840
Where are you guys clicking?

3224
03:46:58,840 --> 03:47:05,299
Your minions that cost five or more cost five.

3225
03:47:05,299 --> 03:47:06,739
You can use your hero power twice each turn.

3226
03:47:06,739 --> 03:47:08,819
It costs one or death rattles.

3227
03:47:09,379 --> 03:47:12,500
So all the minions that are five or more just cost five.

3228
03:47:13,219 --> 03:47:19,479
Dude, you're never even gonna get to level 60.

3229
03:47:19,479 --> 03:47:20,120
Who are you kidding?

3230
03:47:20,760 --> 03:47:25,299
All right.

3231
03:47:25,299 --> 03:47:26,420
We need big minions now.

3232
03:47:33,180 --> 03:47:34,700
Babbling book we got.

3233
03:47:34,700 --> 03:47:35,659
What do we got for minions?

3234
03:47:37,020 --> 03:47:37,659
Calcigos.

3235
03:47:49,979 --> 03:47:51,579
Where do you want me to go here?

3236
03:47:52,899 --> 03:47:53,459
Can I ask?

3237
03:47:55,299 --> 03:47:58,500
24% of everybody that's clicking the screen.

3238
03:47:58,500 --> 03:47:59,639
Where do you want me to go?

3239
03:48:05,270 --> 03:48:05,989
Quit the game?

3240
03:48:14,469 --> 03:48:15,430
No, this is what we're doing.

3241
03:48:17,209 --> 03:48:18,809
Cooking simulator tomorrow.

3242
03:48:18,809 --> 03:48:20,870
Because it actually releases.

3243
03:48:20,870 --> 03:48:27,190
No, I'm not going to start here as it might magic through now.

3244
03:48:28,620 --> 03:48:32,120
No, this is a Hearthstone comfortable stream.

3245
03:48:32,120 --> 03:48:33,209
Didn't I just?

3246
03:48:33,209 --> 03:48:34,569
Dude, why am I doing this twice in a row?

3247
03:48:39,770 --> 03:48:40,649
Play Constructed?

3248
03:48:43,500 --> 03:48:44,459
I can't do that.

3249
03:48:48,739 --> 03:48:49,540
After Arena.

3250
03:48:49,540 --> 03:48:52,500
It was it was an absolute disaster.

3251
03:48:52,500 --> 03:48:54,020
I will try Arena one more time.

3252
03:48:59,379 --> 03:49:01,540
Getting deja vu, but I don't mind this start.

3253
03:49:02,659 --> 03:49:14,549
Should I start doing Bane?

3254
03:49:15,590 --> 03:49:17,829
But to get chat under control?

3255
03:49:19,479 --> 03:49:20,440
Do viewer games?

3256
03:49:21,000 --> 03:49:25,370
Can you do viewer games?

3257
03:49:26,409 --> 03:49:28,899
Wouldn't I have to like add a bunch of people on battle net?

3258
03:49:29,780 --> 03:49:30,659
I don't think you can do that.

3259
03:49:30,659 --> 03:49:30,979
Can you?

3260
03:49:35,989 --> 03:49:37,430
I have to add everybody on battle net.

3261
03:49:37,989 --> 03:49:45,110
All right, what do I want to do?

3262
03:49:46,069 --> 03:49:50,149
I want to after you cast a spell do one damage to a random enemy minion.

3263
03:49:50,950 --> 03:49:57,159
That sounds pretty good.

3264
03:49:57,159 --> 03:49:58,600
Make a guild in Classic WoW.

3265
03:49:58,600 --> 03:49:59,319
I was thinking about it.

3266
03:50:04,500 --> 03:50:11,180
What do I think about Magic Gathering?

3267
03:50:11,180 --> 03:50:12,700
It's too complicated for me.

3268
03:50:13,420 --> 03:50:14,700
It's just too much for me.

3269
03:50:14,700 --> 03:50:16,059
I can barely handle Hearthstone.

3270
03:50:16,700 --> 03:50:18,870
All right, so here we go.

3271
03:50:18,870 --> 03:50:19,190
Ready?

3272
03:50:19,190 --> 03:50:19,829
I'm going for it.

3273
03:50:23,879 --> 03:50:24,200
Yep.

3274
03:50:25,829 --> 03:50:26,549
It worked.

3275
03:50:38,840 --> 03:50:39,719
Too complicated.

3276
03:50:39,719 --> 03:50:40,840
Yeah, it just kind of is.

3277
03:50:50,790 --> 03:50:55,590
So a game like Hearthstone I can obviously just

3278
03:50:55,590 --> 03:50:57,110
dick around and play it like once in a while.

3279
03:50:58,149 --> 03:51:04,680
But yeah, you kind of know what you're doing in Magic the Gathering.

3280
03:51:05,399 --> 03:51:06,760
You need to know a lot, don't you?

3281
03:51:09,500 --> 03:51:10,540
Should I bring out?

3282
03:51:10,540 --> 03:51:11,819
Let's just get a magic trick.

3283
03:51:12,780 --> 03:51:20,739
I mean, just do that now.

3284
03:51:20,739 --> 03:51:22,340
Maybe I'll get another free one.

3285
03:51:23,059 --> 03:51:37,420
You have to learn the basics, but Magic Gathering Arena is autopilot.

3286
03:51:37,420 --> 03:51:38,299
Just autopilot.

3287
03:51:43,350 --> 03:51:46,629
You're not going to attack me, huh?

3288
03:51:49,940 --> 03:51:51,219
Well, there's Kelsagos.

3289
03:51:53,979 --> 03:51:54,299
I can.

3290
03:51:54,299 --> 03:51:54,860
All right, here we go.

3291
03:51:54,860 --> 03:51:55,420
Watch this.

3292
03:51:55,420 --> 03:51:57,180
Your first spell each turn causes zero.

3293
03:52:04,440 --> 03:52:05,079
Three damage.

3294
03:52:05,079 --> 03:52:07,479
Freeze the character if I was to freeze the minion if it's already frozen.

3295
03:52:07,479 --> 03:52:07,879
Destroy it.

3296
03:52:07,879 --> 03:52:08,280
This one.

3297
03:52:09,000 --> 03:52:14,360
And then we're going to sheep you and face.

3298
03:52:16,120 --> 03:52:21,879
Thanks for the free spells, Kelsagos.

3299
03:52:32,090 --> 03:52:35,940
Yeah, for the most part, the last couple of streams have really just been

3300
03:52:38,629 --> 03:52:40,069
I needed low-key stuff.

3301
03:52:40,069 --> 03:52:41,909
And I mean, we've been dicking around and I've been making

3302
03:52:42,790 --> 03:52:45,909
fucking loud noises, but I really was supposed to take it easy.

3303
03:52:48,020 --> 03:52:51,370
So tomorrow we're going to be doing cooking simulator.

3304
03:52:52,010 --> 03:52:55,850
So don't worry.

3305
03:52:55,850 --> 03:52:56,649
I think I win.

3306
03:52:57,879 --> 03:52:59,639
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

3307
03:53:03,370 --> 03:53:04,010
Nine, ten.

3308
03:53:04,010 --> 03:53:05,290
I could get good RNG here.

3309
03:53:05,850 --> 03:53:06,729
Here we go.

3310
03:53:06,729 --> 03:53:07,989
I'm just going to, who cares?

3311
03:53:14,379 --> 03:53:14,940
Is that it?

3312
03:53:15,500 --> 03:53:17,260
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

3313
03:53:17,260 --> 03:53:17,760
Ah!

3314
03:53:33,129 --> 03:53:34,250
Am I going to play Dreams again?

3315
03:53:36,389 --> 03:53:40,489
Yeah, I'll probably play Dreams once I hook up the PS4 again.

3316
03:53:42,819 --> 03:53:45,299
Because at that point, oh, he just goes for his first spell.

3317
03:53:45,860 --> 03:53:50,700
Um, once we have something else to do on PS4.

3318
03:53:50,700 --> 03:53:53,819
Because by this point, I think there's a lot more stuff in Dreams.

3319
03:53:54,700 --> 03:53:55,200
So yeah.

3320
03:53:56,780 --> 03:53:57,420
I think so.

3321
03:53:58,299 --> 03:54:08,340
Yeah, we've played it a few times already.

3322
03:54:08,899 --> 03:54:10,500
It's really, really fun.

3323
03:54:10,500 --> 03:54:13,340
It's really interesting.

3324
03:54:13,340 --> 03:54:14,379
It's fun just to channel surf.

3325
03:54:21,159 --> 03:54:24,280
Well, yeah, we kind of have to go big because these will all be five cost.

3326
03:54:28,540 --> 03:54:29,500
Go big.

3327
03:54:29,500 --> 03:54:31,020
100% click.

3328
03:54:31,020 --> 03:54:31,579
Look at that.

3329
03:54:36,360 --> 03:54:43,420
Oh, I also have to check on my, um, I'm going to check on the, um, what is it though?

3330
03:54:45,180 --> 03:54:47,579
Didn't I release the worm to the public?

3331
03:54:48,299 --> 03:54:49,979
I wonder if anybody did anything with it.

3332
03:54:49,979 --> 03:54:51,180
All healing is doubled.

3333
03:54:52,219 --> 03:54:56,920
What's wrong?

3334
03:55:01,639 --> 03:55:03,860
Hey, what's wrong?

3335
03:55:03,860 --> 03:55:04,500
What's going on here?

3336
03:55:06,680 --> 03:55:07,159
You all right?

3337
03:55:08,920 --> 03:55:12,250
That was weird.

3338
03:55:12,250 --> 03:55:18,840
They having server trouble?

3339
03:55:25,829 --> 03:55:26,469
The worm.

3340
03:55:34,709 --> 03:55:35,670
Ban for BM.

3341
03:55:35,670 --> 03:55:36,069
Who, me?

3342
03:55:36,069 --> 03:55:38,790
Who are you referring to?

3343
03:55:39,510 --> 03:55:47,059
Try to say 3095C because I was supposed to delete that at a thousand.

3344
03:55:50,069 --> 03:55:51,190
I need a new number now.

3345
03:55:52,969 --> 03:55:57,879
Do I have any elementals?

3346
03:56:02,819 --> 03:56:04,739
I don't think there's any elementals even in the whole deck.

3347
03:56:05,379 --> 03:56:09,180
I guess the flame geyser will make one or two.

3348
03:56:24,020 --> 03:56:25,459
Double healing.

3349
03:56:26,020 --> 03:56:26,819
Not going to play a card.

3350
03:56:26,819 --> 03:56:28,020
All right, I'll just take it.

3351
03:56:28,020 --> 03:56:28,520
Fine.

3352
03:56:29,059 --> 03:56:34,180
All right, let me, let me summon an elemental.

3353
03:56:35,850 --> 03:56:37,049
That's an elemental, isn't it?

3354
03:56:37,690 --> 03:56:40,790
This is an elemental, right?

3355
03:56:42,549 --> 03:56:43,030
It's not.

3356
03:56:44,229 --> 03:56:44,950
Oh, shit.

3357
03:56:50,299 --> 03:56:51,180
This is an elemental.

3358
03:56:51,180 --> 03:56:51,899
Arcane Anomaly.

3359
03:56:51,899 --> 03:56:52,940
Should I just get it out there?

3360
03:56:58,120 --> 03:56:58,840
Read the card.

3361
03:56:58,840 --> 03:57:00,920
Well, I know, I just saw like the fucking goo.

3362
03:57:15,940 --> 03:57:17,379
Eight health to all minions.

3363
03:57:20,729 --> 03:57:22,969
All right, I'm going to have a pretty big hand for this.

3364
03:57:23,770 --> 03:57:29,139
I'm just going to go face and then next turn have like a huge minion

3365
03:57:40,469 --> 03:57:41,110
because that will be

3366
03:57:43,479 --> 03:57:45,319
one, two, three, four, five, six.

3367
03:57:45,319 --> 03:57:46,600
It'll be a seven cost minion.

3368
03:57:52,409 --> 03:57:56,180
Do I get this?

3369
03:57:56,180 --> 03:57:56,899
No, yeah, next turn.

3370
03:57:56,899 --> 03:57:57,620
What is it?

3371
03:57:57,620 --> 03:57:58,180
It's a taunt.

3372
03:57:59,350 --> 03:57:59,989
All right, here we go.

3373
03:58:00,629 --> 03:58:01,989
Seven cost minion incoming.

3374
03:58:07,659 --> 03:58:08,860
Oh, damn it.

3375
03:58:11,510 --> 03:58:13,670
Oh, they're going to kill it right now too.

3376
03:58:13,670 --> 03:58:14,069
Shit.

3377
03:58:14,069 --> 03:58:14,469
Oh well.

3378
03:58:26,020 --> 03:58:30,020
What does he get from this?

3379
03:58:36,950 --> 03:58:38,149
I know you're going to kill it.

3380
03:58:38,149 --> 03:58:39,750
Yeah, I don't get to see the fun thing.

3381
03:58:41,780 --> 03:58:43,540
I get a taunt now and we can do it again.

3382
03:58:44,420 --> 03:58:47,590
Give me something else.

3383
03:58:51,299 --> 03:58:51,620
All right.

3384
03:59:07,020 --> 03:59:08,139
Maybe I don't even do anything.

3385
03:59:10,620 --> 03:59:11,899
What is the rewards thing?

3386
03:59:12,780 --> 03:59:13,899
Freudian weapon.

3387
03:59:13,899 --> 03:59:14,379
Cheer.

3388
03:59:14,379 --> 03:59:16,459
Shared rewards to three others in chat.

3389
03:59:16,459 --> 03:59:17,020
What happened?

3390
03:59:21,639 --> 03:59:22,440
What does that actually do?

3391
03:59:33,780 --> 03:59:34,659
Share rewards.

3392
03:59:35,219 --> 03:59:36,579
I have no idea.

3393
03:59:36,579 --> 03:59:47,159
Oh, he's going to inspire.

3394
03:59:48,120 --> 03:59:50,420
I get two of these things, man.

3395
03:59:51,459 --> 03:59:52,979
Really?

3396
03:59:56,489 --> 03:59:58,409
Well, now we fire lands.

3397
03:59:59,209 --> 04:00:08,680
God, kill somebody.

3398
04:00:09,399 --> 04:00:16,200
Any elementals in the hand?

3399
04:00:16,200 --> 04:00:16,440
No.

3400
04:00:22,010 --> 04:00:22,329
Six.

3401
04:00:25,129 --> 04:00:26,090
What is this game?

3402
04:00:36,149 --> 04:00:38,709
All right, got a taunt restore eight health to your hero.

3403
04:00:38,709 --> 04:00:39,430
That's pretty good.

3404
04:00:39,430 --> 04:00:41,190
We can just take one damage at a time.

3405
04:00:42,069 --> 04:00:44,149
I can cast a spell.

3406
04:00:44,149 --> 04:00:45,750
We get one damage to a random enemy.

3407
04:00:49,020 --> 04:00:50,469
We're just going to go with the face.

3408
04:00:51,110 --> 04:00:55,770
Whenever this attacks and kills a minion,

3409
04:00:55,770 --> 04:00:56,889
summon two murlocs for me.

3410
04:00:56,889 --> 04:00:58,569
I don't have any murlocs in my deck.

3411
04:00:58,569 --> 04:01:04,120
I mean, just do this.

3412
04:01:10,920 --> 04:01:11,719
I don't want that here.

3413
04:01:12,440 --> 04:01:13,000
Murlocs?

3414
04:01:13,799 --> 04:01:14,520
No, I don't have any.

3415
04:01:16,200 --> 04:01:20,540
What's my voice?

3416
04:01:20,540 --> 04:01:21,340
Am I eating something?

3417
04:01:21,340 --> 04:01:22,299
No, I was just going like this.

3418
04:01:24,299 --> 04:01:33,670
Oh, fuck.

3419
04:02:03,270 --> 04:02:04,149
You don't have two of those.

3420
04:02:04,149 --> 04:02:04,950
You're not going to do that again.

3421
04:02:13,420 --> 04:02:14,299
Good, good.

3422
04:02:14,299 --> 04:02:14,860
Okay, we're good.

3423
04:02:15,739 --> 04:02:18,069
Deal two damage.

3424
04:02:18,069 --> 04:02:19,829
Add a one, two, uh-huh.

3425
04:02:25,500 --> 04:02:27,260
And you, whenever a friendly minion is healed,

3426
04:02:27,260 --> 04:02:30,739
summon a three, three whelp.

3427
04:02:30,739 --> 04:02:31,459
I don't think so.

3428
04:02:32,260 --> 04:02:32,659
Sorry.

3429
04:02:37,459 --> 04:02:40,280
Did I miss lethal?

3430
04:02:42,120 --> 04:02:43,000
Oh, God damn it.

3431
04:02:43,000 --> 04:02:45,159
He's going to do this fucking four times.

3432
04:02:55,079 --> 04:03:02,420
Remember I was talking about this last night?

3433
04:03:02,420 --> 04:03:17,219
I mean, that's an elemental, but who cares?

3434
04:03:17,940 --> 04:03:22,469
I have to kind of, what do I do?

3435
04:03:23,190 --> 04:03:26,760
I might just go face.

3436
04:03:26,760 --> 04:03:27,719
I kind of have to, right?

3437
04:03:27,719 --> 04:03:29,239
No, but he's going to heal everything.

3438
04:03:42,809 --> 04:03:43,770
Oh, my God.

3439
04:03:44,809 --> 04:04:17,659
I mean, uh, three, eight, seven, six, five, four.

3440
04:04:17,659 --> 04:04:18,379
What do you mean?

3441
04:04:18,379 --> 04:04:18,940
What did I do?

3442
04:04:21,850 --> 04:04:22,250
What was it?

3443
04:04:22,250 --> 04:04:26,379
What was the other one?

3444
04:04:26,379 --> 04:04:28,379
Didn't get shatter?

3445
04:04:28,379 --> 04:04:29,100
Oh, that's right.

3446
04:04:29,100 --> 04:04:30,379
This thing freezes people.

3447
04:04:30,379 --> 04:04:31,579
Oh, fuck.

3448
04:04:31,579 --> 04:04:32,459
I forgot.

3449
04:04:32,459 --> 04:04:34,860
It should be called ice water elemental.

3450
04:04:34,860 --> 04:04:35,659
I forgot.

3451
04:04:35,659 --> 04:04:37,579
I haven't seen this card in four years.

3452
04:04:38,219 --> 04:04:42,709
Aye, I'm going to lose this anyways.

3453
04:04:50,229 --> 04:04:52,489
I think I'm just screwed.

3454
04:04:52,489 --> 04:04:54,780
What am I going to do about this?

3455
04:04:54,780 --> 04:04:55,180
Let's see.

3456
04:04:57,260 --> 04:05:11,219
Oh, my chest.

3457
04:05:14,100 --> 04:05:21,559
Hey, how about this one?

3458
04:05:22,280 --> 04:05:23,319
Oh, whatever.

3459
04:05:48,440 --> 04:06:32,069
Didn't get very far on that one.

3460
04:06:32,069 --> 04:06:32,790
Do arena.

3461
04:06:33,959 --> 04:06:37,049
I don't have any coins for arena.

3462
04:06:37,049 --> 04:06:39,739
I have to buy arena.

3463
04:06:39,739 --> 04:06:49,610
I'm not doing that.

3464
04:06:49,690 --> 04:07:00,360
I got I got you want me to spend $1.99 to go into the arena.

3465
04:07:00,360 --> 04:07:00,760
Do it.

3466
04:07:01,639 --> 04:07:03,399
Don't buy arena.

3467
04:07:03,399 --> 04:07:05,639
You never buy arena.

3468
04:07:05,639 --> 04:07:09,450
You really don't ever purchase arena.

3469
04:07:09,450 --> 04:07:11,930
Purchasing arena is what a grandmother would do.

3470
04:07:12,569 --> 04:07:16,649
Like an addicted grandmother would be buying arena over and over again

3471
04:07:16,649 --> 04:07:17,930
and losing oh and three.

3472
04:07:17,930 --> 04:07:19,290
Oh, that was really fun.

3473
04:07:19,290 --> 04:07:22,940
Now they're going to do that again.

3474
04:07:22,940 --> 04:07:24,540
No, I just have to do some quests.

3475
04:07:24,540 --> 04:07:27,700
Hunter, pirates, and weapons.

3476
04:07:27,700 --> 04:07:32,059
I'm going to play hunter and I'm going to play weapons.

3477
04:07:32,620 --> 04:07:40,889
So play 20 hunter cards and use six weapons.

3478
04:07:41,450 --> 04:07:47,079
Is there such thing as pirate hunter?

3479
04:07:47,079 --> 04:08:03,260
Okay, pirate.

3480
04:08:06,979 --> 04:08:09,139
Draw two card overkill taunt.

3481
04:08:09,139 --> 04:08:39,420
Okay, now we need hunter, just hunter cards.

3482
04:08:46,889 --> 04:09:13,239
Okay, let's do um, I'm sure I didn't rank.

3483
04:09:14,040 --> 04:09:23,850
Rank 25.

3484
04:09:23,850 --> 04:09:24,329
Let's go.

3485
04:09:24,329 --> 04:09:25,209
I'll show you.

3486
04:09:25,209 --> 04:09:28,649
Oh, this person has a cool portrait.

3487
04:09:28,649 --> 04:09:29,530
That means that they're good.

3488
04:09:30,010 --> 04:09:46,299
All right, I need to play pirates and hunter cards and weapons.

3489
04:09:46,299 --> 04:10:02,139
This is only to get to arena so I can embarrass myself again.

3490
04:10:02,139 --> 04:10:02,620
Thank you.

3491
04:10:03,420 --> 04:10:04,940
I can get the pirates out even faster.

3492
04:10:14,229 --> 04:10:17,659
Okay, has Charger and weapon equipped?

3493
04:10:18,459 --> 04:10:19,979
Well, let's just play it smart.

3494
04:10:19,979 --> 04:10:22,940
Let's get the weapon on and then let's put these guys out next turn.

3495
04:10:23,659 --> 04:10:30,139
No, I'm not gonna idiot.

3496
04:10:36,649 --> 04:10:52,120
Okay, I mean like let's go.

3497
04:10:56,780 --> 04:10:58,139
That was wild.

3498
04:10:58,139 --> 04:10:59,340
Get six mana.

3499
04:10:59,340 --> 04:11:00,860
Let's see what you're gonna put down.

3500
04:11:00,860 --> 04:11:10,309
Dead three damage.

3501
04:11:18,059 --> 04:11:19,500
This is you're playing against a baby.

3502
04:11:19,500 --> 04:11:20,540
This is a kid's game.

3503
04:11:20,540 --> 04:11:21,579
No, it's not a kid's game.

3504
04:11:21,579 --> 04:11:22,620
This is a family game.

3505
04:11:37,690 --> 04:11:38,569
Attack with weapon.

3506
04:11:38,569 --> 04:11:39,450
No, not yet.

3507
04:11:39,450 --> 04:11:42,250
No, if you put something down it needs to I need to be able to kill it.

3508
04:11:43,620 --> 04:11:47,190
See that needs to be I need to be able to kill that.

3509
04:11:52,440 --> 04:11:55,379
Oh, look at that.

3510
04:11:55,379 --> 04:11:56,420
No, I don't need to use that.

3511
04:11:58,979 --> 04:11:59,780
Well, maybe I should.

3512
04:12:24,979 --> 04:12:26,020
Why do I keep saying that?

3513
04:12:32,219 --> 04:12:37,100
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

3514
04:12:37,100 --> 04:12:50,299
Don't get me.

3515
04:13:00,780 --> 04:13:01,420
Come on.

3516
04:13:01,420 --> 04:13:24,059
You want to see what that secret is, don't you?

3517
04:13:24,059 --> 04:13:26,790
Give me I'm gonna do it again.

3518
04:13:27,989 --> 04:13:29,590
I'm gonna freezing trap again.

3519
04:13:31,219 --> 04:13:33,579
Oh, yeah.

3520
04:13:33,579 --> 04:13:43,590
How's that sound?

3521
04:13:43,590 --> 04:13:44,950
Rank 25.

3522
04:13:47,639 --> 04:13:48,139
This.

3523
04:13:49,319 --> 04:13:50,440
God damn it.

3524
04:13:50,440 --> 04:13:52,840
I can't like just get rid of these.

3525
04:13:59,219 --> 04:14:00,020
Somebody came in.

3526
04:14:02,100 --> 04:14:03,139
Somebody just gave me a road.

3527
04:14:03,700 --> 04:14:05,700
Pirate hunter with a question mark.

3528
04:14:05,700 --> 04:14:06,340
It's bucket.

3529
04:14:06,340 --> 04:14:11,590
That's so funny.

3530
04:14:11,590 --> 04:14:12,790
Oh, this is it.

3531
04:14:15,139 --> 04:14:17,139
Five, six, seven, eight.

3532
04:14:18,459 --> 04:14:19,020
This is it.

3533
04:14:19,819 --> 04:14:28,309
I'm gonna win.

3534
04:14:40,120 --> 04:14:41,079
Yeah, I know.

3535
04:14:41,079 --> 04:14:42,040
Don't heal to full health.

3536
04:14:44,069 --> 04:14:45,670
We're gonna be rich.

3537
04:14:45,670 --> 04:14:47,110
No, it's all right.

3538
04:14:50,950 --> 04:14:51,670
Five out of five.

3539
04:14:51,670 --> 04:14:53,430
Oh, you have to restore five health.

3540
04:14:53,430 --> 04:14:53,829
What?

3541
04:14:53,829 --> 04:14:54,709
Oh, fuck.

3542
04:14:54,709 --> 04:14:55,110
It's all right.

3543
04:14:55,110 --> 04:15:07,899
I can get four, five, six, seven, eight.

3544
04:15:08,540 --> 04:15:10,549
Should I release the hounds?

3545
04:15:11,190 --> 04:15:21,799
Okay, come on.

3546
04:15:22,360 --> 04:15:24,549
Discover friendly death rental minion.

3547
04:15:24,549 --> 04:15:26,309
When an enemy attacks your heroes,

3548
04:15:26,309 --> 04:15:27,750
it attacks another random character.

3549
04:15:27,750 --> 04:15:30,840
Just misdirection or explosive trap.

3550
04:15:30,840 --> 04:15:32,040
The explosive trap, I think.

3551
04:15:36,440 --> 04:15:40,309
And then put it on and release the hounds.

3552
04:15:40,309 --> 04:15:55,049
If I release the hounds.

3553
04:15:58,620 --> 04:15:59,260
Oh, shit.

3554
04:15:59,819 --> 04:16:01,260
If I release the hounds, then I can...

3555
04:16:18,920 --> 04:16:20,040
Well, that shouldn't be trade.

3556
04:16:20,040 --> 04:16:20,680
But I need to trade

3557
04:16:20,680 --> 04:16:22,120
because now he doesn't have any minions.

3558
04:16:25,909 --> 04:16:28,229
Why do you have so many of these?

3559
04:16:29,110 --> 04:16:36,100
I swear to God, I've seen this seven times.

3560
04:16:36,100 --> 04:16:36,899
Freezing trap?

3561
04:16:41,610 --> 04:16:44,090
I'm the top Hearthstone streamer on Twitch right now.

3562
04:16:44,090 --> 04:16:45,690
Oh, no, no.

3563
04:17:00,659 --> 04:17:01,780
Three, six, seven.

3564
04:17:02,420 --> 04:17:02,979
It's over.

3565
04:17:07,020 --> 04:17:09,020
This is not a sponsored stream.

3566
04:17:09,979 --> 04:17:10,780
Oh, just...

3567
04:17:11,500 --> 04:17:26,579
This is so embarrassing.

3568
04:17:33,260 --> 04:17:34,540
Wait a minute, did you screw up?

3569
04:17:36,280 --> 04:17:36,920
I just won.

3570
04:17:38,219 --> 04:17:39,180
No, fuck.

3571
04:17:40,790 --> 04:17:42,389
No, stop healing.

3572
04:17:45,479 --> 04:17:47,159
He's gonna get these two again.

3573
04:17:55,909 --> 04:17:56,549
Why?

3574
04:17:56,549 --> 04:17:58,760
Oh, shit.

3575
04:17:59,799 --> 04:18:02,870
What else do I even have in here?

3576
04:18:18,790 --> 04:18:19,829
Now I'm gonna rope him.

3577
04:18:34,010 --> 04:18:35,370
Stuck in chicken league forever.

3578
04:18:39,850 --> 04:18:40,250
All right.

3579
04:18:40,250 --> 04:18:41,690
We just have to do this a couple more times.

3580
04:18:41,690 --> 04:18:42,090
I'm gonna...

3581
04:18:42,969 --> 04:18:46,219
Six pirates to play as...

3582
04:18:46,219 --> 04:18:47,420
We're just doing this to get to arena.

3583
04:19:02,469 --> 04:19:04,709
Unironically stuck at 25.

3584
04:19:04,709 --> 04:19:05,510
Yeah, but we just...

3585
04:19:06,149 --> 04:19:10,069
This deck is awful.

3586
04:19:10,069 --> 04:19:10,549
It's just...

3587
04:19:10,549 --> 04:19:13,430
I just put pirates together just to throw them in here and give...

3588
04:19:14,229 --> 04:19:15,829
Until we get to play arena.

3589
04:19:15,829 --> 04:19:17,829
Pirate hunter.

3590
04:19:17,829 --> 04:19:18,549
You think I'm...

3591
04:19:21,139 --> 04:19:22,819
He's buying more packs.

3592
04:19:25,399 --> 04:19:26,760
Maybe in some other lifetime.

3593
04:19:40,409 --> 04:19:40,889
If I...

3594
04:19:40,889 --> 04:19:41,370
Yeah, I haven't...

3595
04:19:41,370 --> 04:19:43,370
No, I haven't played Cal Drogo yet.

3596
04:19:43,370 --> 04:19:45,620
Let's go.

3597
04:19:55,510 --> 04:19:57,590
Buy packs with your sponsorship money.

3598
04:19:59,799 --> 04:20:02,040
Put the pack opening on your main channel.

3599
04:20:10,760 --> 04:20:12,280
Oh, you got this guy on the ropes.

3600
04:20:14,260 --> 04:20:15,059
Two turkeys.

3601
04:20:15,059 --> 04:20:16,500
Who's gonna make it out on top?

3602
04:20:17,059 --> 04:20:17,700
I wonder.

3603
04:20:18,340 --> 04:20:24,040
Oh, no.

3604
04:20:24,040 --> 04:20:24,520
Don't do that.

3605
04:20:24,520 --> 04:20:25,159
That...

3606
04:20:25,159 --> 04:20:25,719
I could like...

3607
04:20:26,860 --> 04:20:28,700
I was gonna just kill Commandment's face.

3608
04:20:37,510 --> 04:20:39,270
It has ranked 25.

3609
04:20:41,700 --> 04:20:42,899
Hold on, it says...

3610
04:20:42,899 --> 04:20:46,420
It has ranked 25 next to his name on the stream link.

3611
04:20:47,610 --> 04:20:49,049
What do you mean the stream link?

3612
04:20:54,309 --> 04:20:55,190
Wait, what?

3613
04:20:56,790 --> 04:21:01,770
Why does it say that?

3614
04:21:05,979 --> 04:21:08,389
Ranked 35.

3615
04:21:12,500 --> 04:21:14,020
That's fucking ridiculous.

3616
04:21:16,389 --> 04:21:17,909
Why would it say my rank?

3617
04:21:17,909 --> 04:21:19,750
I don't want it to say what rank I am.

3618
04:21:21,819 --> 04:21:22,620
What did he just do?

3619
04:21:33,719 --> 04:21:36,729
Uh, I'm just gonna put on freezing trap.

3620
04:21:44,219 --> 04:21:45,430
This is the...

3621
04:21:45,430 --> 04:21:48,469
Oh, Jesus.

3622
04:21:59,129 --> 04:22:01,530
Everyone on Twitch knows now.

3623
04:22:01,530 --> 04:22:04,870
Yeah, people are gonna scroll by and they're gonna know.

3624
04:22:05,590 --> 04:22:06,389
Everyone knows now.

3625
04:22:06,389 --> 04:22:07,110
I can't hide it.

3626
04:22:15,290 --> 04:22:18,459
I can't get over that in the tags.

3627
04:22:18,459 --> 04:22:19,020
It knows.

3628
04:22:26,920 --> 04:22:28,520
Ranked 25 is the best rank yet.

3629
04:22:28,520 --> 04:22:31,479
Ranked 25 is the highest rank you can be.

3630
04:22:33,670 --> 04:22:35,590
You can't get higher than 25.

3631
04:22:36,069 --> 04:22:36,870
You can go...

3632
04:22:39,659 --> 04:22:40,299
What happened?

3633
04:22:49,399 --> 04:22:50,360
I'm confused.

3634
04:22:50,360 --> 04:22:50,760
Hold on.

3635
04:22:51,319 --> 04:23:00,889
Can I get someone besides spells?

3636
04:23:04,250 --> 04:23:05,770
Yeah, no, you can't be...

3637
04:23:05,770 --> 04:23:07,209
This is the highest rank you can be.

3638
04:23:08,010 --> 04:23:08,409
You can...

3639
04:23:08,409 --> 04:23:10,340
Sure, you can go lower.

3640
04:23:10,340 --> 04:23:12,979
You can drop lower in rank.

3641
04:23:12,979 --> 04:23:27,159
But I'm the highest rank in Hearthstone.

3642
04:23:27,159 --> 04:23:29,559
Why do I have all these fucking spells?

3643
04:23:36,139 --> 04:23:36,620
Just get...

3644
04:23:36,620 --> 04:23:37,659
I don't want them anymore.

3645
04:23:37,659 --> 04:23:38,299
Just get them out.

3646
04:23:38,940 --> 04:23:48,870
Because you auto-completed your deck.

3647
04:23:49,819 --> 04:23:50,780
Oh yeah, I forgot.

3648
04:23:51,420 --> 04:23:52,780
We were just doing this to get to Arena.

3649
04:23:57,459 --> 04:24:02,090
Whenever this minion takes the...

3650
04:24:02,090 --> 04:24:02,489
What is that?

3651
04:24:04,360 --> 04:24:05,879
Summon a 2-3 mech with taunt.

3652
04:24:05,879 --> 04:24:06,680
He's waiting for that one.

3653
04:24:07,319 --> 04:24:29,909
This is the kind of shit you can experience

3654
04:24:30,469 --> 04:24:33,510
on the number one Hearthstone stream on Twitch.

3655
04:24:34,790 --> 04:24:43,459
Number one.

3656
04:24:43,459 --> 04:24:44,979
Ranked 25 plays.

3657
04:24:45,780 --> 04:24:58,139
This guy's pretending to be a noob

3658
04:24:58,139 --> 04:25:02,059
and he's going to pull out an OTK combo?

3659
04:25:02,059 --> 04:25:04,870
Like, dead in one turn?

3660
04:25:06,969 --> 04:25:08,729
I will laugh my fucking ass off

3661
04:25:08,729 --> 04:25:10,090
if I lose in one turn.

3662
04:25:10,090 --> 04:25:12,250
If I get one turn super comboed,

3663
04:25:12,809 --> 04:25:13,370
one turn...

3664
04:25:14,809 --> 04:25:16,010
I will cry laughing.

3665
04:25:24,540 --> 04:25:26,139
No, there's nothing wrong with this.

3666
04:25:26,139 --> 04:25:27,739
You know, the game is free

3667
04:25:27,739 --> 04:25:29,340
and anybody can just get it and play it.

3668
04:25:29,340 --> 04:25:31,819
And you've got to start somewhere.

3669
04:25:58,219 --> 04:25:59,260
Yeah, but you didn't just start.

3670
04:26:00,299 --> 04:26:01,420
Yeah, I have prob...

3671
04:26:01,420 --> 04:26:02,299
I'm not going to lie.

3672
04:26:02,299 --> 04:26:03,020
I'll be honest with you.

3673
04:26:04,780 --> 04:26:08,059
I absolutely have like 400 hours in this game.

3674
04:26:09,399 --> 04:26:11,079
I mean, maybe like 200 hours

3675
04:26:11,079 --> 04:26:12,360
of those are opening packs.

3676
04:26:13,159 --> 04:26:15,000
But this is like back in 2013.

3677
04:26:17,450 --> 04:26:18,649
Oh yeah, what a trade.

3678
04:26:21,819 --> 04:26:22,319
What?

3679
04:26:31,940 --> 04:26:32,899
What's happening?

3680
04:26:32,899 --> 04:26:33,399
Oh, the...

3681
04:26:43,639 --> 04:26:44,360
Get out, leave.

3682
04:26:44,360 --> 04:26:45,719
Don't come to this stream.

3683
04:26:45,719 --> 04:26:47,399
This stream is not one you want to watch.

3684
04:26:48,329 --> 04:26:50,809
The viewers have gone up by like 240.

3685
04:26:50,809 --> 04:26:53,049
You don't want to be here.

3686
04:27:06,180 --> 04:27:08,420
There's a stream like right there

3687
04:27:08,420 --> 04:27:10,600
that you should probably watch instead.

3688
04:27:10,600 --> 04:27:11,559
It's like over there.

3689
04:27:12,120 --> 04:27:16,420
Am I having fun?

3690
04:27:16,420 --> 04:27:16,920
Yeah.

3691
04:27:20,149 --> 04:27:21,829
He just got this game for father's day.

3692
04:27:21,829 --> 04:27:23,750
Yeah, my son told me to try this on.

3693
04:27:23,750 --> 04:27:25,030
It's called Hearthstone.

3694
04:27:25,590 --> 04:27:30,120
What do you got here?

3695
04:27:30,120 --> 04:27:31,799
Shuffle a bomb into your opponent's deck.

3696
04:27:34,659 --> 04:27:35,780
Well, I need a fucking minion.

3697
04:27:37,700 --> 04:27:49,059
Anybody die this turn?

3698
04:27:49,620 --> 04:27:58,069
Can we get a professional hand cam?

3699
04:28:01,430 --> 04:28:01,930
No.

3700
04:28:06,059 --> 04:28:07,500
A fucking hand cam?

3701
04:28:10,420 --> 04:28:11,139
Oh my God.

3702
04:28:20,790 --> 04:28:23,139
We need to see the inputs.

3703
04:28:27,260 --> 04:28:28,139
Oh my God.

3704
04:28:28,139 --> 04:28:29,979
Did I actually just get echoed here?

3705
04:28:30,780 --> 04:28:32,459
Deal three damage, overkill.

3706
04:28:32,459 --> 04:28:34,059
So I'm gonna five-five Devilsaur.

3707
04:28:34,059 --> 04:28:34,700
That's all I need.

3708
04:28:35,579 --> 04:28:37,780
What is this?

3709
04:28:38,979 --> 04:28:45,450
Here comes a bomb.

3710
04:28:46,170 --> 04:28:52,979
Put on a professional foot cam.

3711
04:28:52,979 --> 04:28:59,420
What does that even...

3712
04:28:59,420 --> 04:28:59,920
What?

3713
04:29:01,209 --> 04:29:02,729
I'm not playing like the drums.

3714
04:29:03,450 --> 04:29:14,010
I think it is one.

3715
04:29:14,979 --> 04:29:15,780
No, God damn it.

3716
04:29:20,010 --> 04:29:20,510
Overkill.

3717
04:29:21,370 --> 04:29:21,870
Come on.

3718
04:29:22,489 --> 04:29:28,040
That's not it.

3719
04:29:28,040 --> 04:29:29,879
Three, four, five.

3720
04:29:30,520 --> 04:29:40,819
I need to kill something.

3721
04:29:44,059 --> 04:29:44,940
I didn't lose yet.

3722
04:29:44,940 --> 04:29:45,440
Not yet.

3723
04:29:52,489 --> 04:29:52,989
We lost.

3724
04:29:52,989 --> 04:29:53,690
No, not yet.

3725
04:29:53,690 --> 04:29:54,190
It's not over.

3726
04:30:01,270 --> 04:30:02,469
Oh God, here it comes.

3727
04:30:08,600 --> 04:30:10,920
No, I just need to get a damage card and I can do it.

3728
04:30:37,340 --> 04:30:45,020
I think it's still possible.

3729
04:30:45,020 --> 04:30:45,520
No, it's not.

3730
04:30:58,299 --> 04:30:58,860
Oh, oops.

3731
04:30:58,860 --> 04:31:00,299
I didn't mean to do that.

3732
04:31:00,299 --> 04:31:02,899
There's a couple of chicken league plays.

3733
04:31:02,899 --> 04:31:16,280
Not a big deal.

3734
04:31:16,280 --> 04:31:16,680
I'm dead.

3735
04:31:16,680 --> 04:31:17,719
He just has to click on me.

3736
04:31:28,969 --> 04:31:30,409
I'm getting BM'd, aren't I?

3737
04:31:43,959 --> 04:31:45,590
This is great.

3738
04:31:45,590 --> 04:31:47,270
Concede before he kills you.

3739
04:31:47,270 --> 04:31:47,770
No.

3740
04:31:48,329 --> 04:31:50,569
I'm gonna concede right when he's about to hit me.

3741
04:31:51,129 --> 04:32:11,399
50 gold, 50 gold, 50 gold.

3742
04:32:11,399 --> 04:32:13,399
Let's go to arena, boys and girls.

3743
04:32:13,399 --> 04:32:28,540
Where we going?

3744
04:32:28,540 --> 04:32:28,940
Who?

3745
04:32:28,940 --> 04:32:36,799
You want me to be Uther the Lightbringer?

3746
04:32:36,799 --> 04:32:50,409
Uther it is?

3747
04:32:50,409 --> 04:32:52,969
All right, we got the last arena deck.

3748
04:32:52,969 --> 04:32:54,729
You can call me terrible all you want, right?

3749
04:32:54,729 --> 04:32:57,290
Like obviously I was playing pirate fucking hunter,

3750
04:32:57,290 --> 04:32:58,090
but this is important.

3751
04:32:58,829 --> 04:33:02,110
The last arena deck was not very good.

3752
04:33:02,110 --> 04:33:02,989
It was very bad.

3753
04:33:05,389 --> 04:33:07,709
It was maybe like a one and a half out of 10.

3754
04:33:08,360 --> 04:33:13,610
So, I mean, you've seen me play heroic single player.

3755
04:33:13,610 --> 04:33:15,069
I was, I did all right.

3756
04:33:15,069 --> 04:33:17,069
I went through a couple runs of the normal one.

3757
04:33:17,630 --> 04:33:22,270
You've seen me play with the right cards.

3758
04:33:22,270 --> 04:33:23,790
I think we can accomplish something here.

3759
04:33:23,790 --> 04:33:24,590
Come on.

3760
04:33:24,590 --> 04:33:25,389
Give me some good ones.

3761
04:33:25,950 --> 04:33:39,040
Flame Juggler, you died on heroic.

3762
04:33:39,040 --> 04:33:42,080
Yeah, but I got to like the eighth boss or seventh boss.

3763
04:33:43,040 --> 04:33:45,200
Splog just gave five community subs.

3764
04:33:45,200 --> 04:33:53,770
Thank you, Splog.

3765
04:33:53,770 --> 04:33:54,270
All right.

3766
04:33:55,319 --> 04:33:57,479
Can I get banned for people playing on,

3767
04:33:58,119 --> 04:34:00,360
well, picking cards is I don't think is,

3768
04:34:01,080 --> 04:34:02,759
it's not like people have control of the game.

3769
04:34:03,400 --> 04:34:15,419
What are you doing?

3770
04:34:15,419 --> 04:34:17,180
Why are so many people clicking on this?

3771
04:34:26,000 --> 04:34:26,560
62%?

3772
04:34:27,520 --> 04:34:35,680
That's such a monster amount of people.

3773
04:34:35,680 --> 04:34:37,119
That what's wrong?

3774
04:34:37,119 --> 04:34:44,639
What is wrong?

3775
04:34:47,709 --> 04:34:49,790
70% of every person just clicked.

3776
04:34:49,790 --> 04:34:51,389
There has to be something going on.

3777
04:34:51,389 --> 04:34:56,360
What is it?

3778
04:34:56,360 --> 04:35:06,279
I'm not buying cards.

3779
04:35:11,450 --> 04:35:14,970
When two thirds of every person clicks on back,

3780
04:35:14,970 --> 04:35:16,569
I think that there's something wrong.

3781
04:35:16,569 --> 04:35:21,599
I'm not buying card packs.

3782
04:35:21,599 --> 04:35:30,759
Choose one of these.

3783
04:35:31,799 --> 04:35:33,560
I'm already opening card packs.

3784
04:35:33,560 --> 04:35:37,790
Every time you click on one of these,

3785
04:35:37,790 --> 04:35:40,669
you get to see another pack of three and you pick one.

3786
04:35:40,669 --> 04:35:48,220
All right.

3787
04:35:48,220 --> 04:35:51,419
So the only card you want me to pick is this one.

3788
04:35:51,419 --> 04:35:53,580
It sounds like a fucking plan, guys.

3789
04:35:58,299 --> 04:35:59,419
What are you doing?

3790
04:36:01,930 --> 04:36:06,400
I'm not actually going to click on lowly squire.

3791
04:36:06,400 --> 04:36:13,529
I'm not actually clicking on this.

3792
04:36:13,529 --> 04:36:14,250
Really?

3793
04:36:14,250 --> 04:36:24,000
This deck already has got trouble written all over it.

3794
04:36:24,000 --> 04:36:36,349
Hold on.

3795
04:36:36,349 --> 04:36:36,750
Hold on.

3796
04:36:36,750 --> 04:36:37,150
Hold on.

3797
04:36:37,150 --> 04:36:38,430
This can be influenced here.

3798
04:36:38,430 --> 04:36:39,229
Hold on.

3799
04:36:39,229 --> 04:36:40,669
Try it again.

3800
04:36:40,669 --> 04:36:47,229
That's better.

3801
04:36:47,229 --> 04:36:51,240
He's being disobedient.

3802
04:36:53,610 --> 04:37:03,180
I'm not clicking on the shop.

3803
04:37:03,180 --> 04:37:04,220
Scribe is the best one.

3804
04:37:04,220 --> 04:37:05,340
It's not even close.

3805
04:37:05,340 --> 04:37:08,159
You know, I wish I could click on it,

3806
04:37:08,159 --> 04:37:13,150
but I have to work with what I'm given.

3807
04:37:28,189 --> 04:37:31,130
Just for anyone that's curious,

3808
04:37:31,130 --> 04:37:35,630
this is the worst card in Hearthstone.

3809
04:37:35,630 --> 04:37:39,659
So I would veto if you even picked this.

3810
04:37:46,459 --> 04:37:48,060
Just pretend this one's not here.

3811
04:37:48,060 --> 04:37:52,060
People are voting for manor rate.

3812
04:37:52,619 --> 04:38:00,080
I feel like the people that are clicking on manor rate

3813
04:38:00,889 --> 04:38:02,889
and the people that are clicking on manor rate,

3814
04:38:02,889 --> 04:38:04,330
especially not manor rate,

3815
04:38:04,330 --> 04:38:07,450
especially the one in the middle there,

3816
04:38:07,450 --> 04:38:11,319
I think they were just doing it to make like a laugh.

3817
04:38:11,319 --> 04:38:11,880
You know what I mean?

3818
04:38:15,689 --> 04:38:16,970
You can't believe I paid for arena.

3819
04:38:16,970 --> 04:38:19,369
How much am I going to get there?

3820
04:38:20,009 --> 04:38:24,799
All right, this amoeba is starting to get together.

3821
04:38:24,799 --> 04:38:26,720
All right, so little exorcist, taunt, battle cry.

3822
04:38:26,720 --> 04:38:27,360
That's pretty good.

3823
04:38:36,189 --> 04:38:37,310
We have too many of these.

3824
04:38:41,439 --> 04:38:42,720
This is the best card in arena.

3825
04:38:48,060 --> 04:38:49,419
I know everyone's clicking on this.

3826
04:38:50,619 --> 04:38:51,259
Hey, what?

3827
04:38:51,259 --> 04:38:51,900
Oops.

3828
04:38:51,900 --> 04:38:54,490
Everyone was clicking on it.

3829
04:38:54,490 --> 04:38:55,049
I know you were.

3830
04:38:55,610 --> 04:38:56,729
Everybody clicked it.

3831
04:38:58,400 --> 04:39:00,000
By the way, guys, can we get a...

3832
04:39:00,000 --> 04:39:00,560
Excuse me.

3833
04:39:01,200 --> 04:39:02,400
If you're going to click,

3834
04:39:02,400 --> 04:39:05,040
please click like in the middle of the cards,

3835
04:39:05,040 --> 04:39:06,479
not like here or here.

3836
04:39:07,119 --> 04:39:07,919
You're making it...

3837
04:39:07,919 --> 04:39:09,200
You're making a big balloon.

3838
04:39:09,919 --> 04:39:12,409
Okay, now that we've had the discussion, go for it.

3839
04:39:30,189 --> 04:39:31,069
93...

3840
04:39:31,709 --> 04:39:34,700
What?

3841
04:39:41,450 --> 04:39:42,409
Oh, I guess I'm...

3842
04:39:46,000 --> 04:39:50,009
Okay, that was a...

3843
04:39:50,569 --> 04:39:55,950
All right, go for it.

3844
04:39:55,950 --> 04:40:10,889
I guess I'm just going to pick this one.

3845
04:40:13,069 --> 04:40:14,590
I'm going to say it's going to be...

3846
04:40:17,400 --> 04:40:18,439
How about...

3847
04:40:18,439 --> 04:40:21,529
I think it's going to be...

3848
04:40:21,529 --> 04:40:32,009
I need some one drops and it's going to be Glowtron.

3849
04:40:32,009 --> 04:40:34,860
Wrong choice.

3850
04:40:34,860 --> 04:40:47,040
I'm sorry, but I'm going by what I see on the screen.

3851
04:40:47,040 --> 04:40:52,560
Always Yeti.

3852
04:40:52,560 --> 04:40:53,919
Oh my fucking God.

3853
04:40:53,919 --> 04:40:55,040
I'm just going to pick the cards.

3854
04:40:55,599 --> 04:40:57,360
I'm just going to fucking pick them.

3855
04:40:57,360 --> 04:40:58,319
I'm just going to pick them.

3856
04:41:06,490 --> 04:41:09,319
He's literally crying.

3857
04:41:09,319 --> 04:41:11,959
You're doing this because you want me to open packs.

3858
04:41:11,959 --> 04:41:23,450
Is that what you really are saying right now?

3859
04:41:23,450 --> 04:41:33,259
Try it again.

3860
04:41:33,259 --> 04:41:34,700
Oh, fucking God damn it.

3861
04:41:35,259 --> 04:41:36,220
It doesn't matter.

3862
04:41:36,220 --> 04:41:37,419
I see you.

3863
04:41:37,419 --> 04:41:38,619
I see you guys right here.

3864
04:41:39,180 --> 04:41:42,720
I was going to pick the Yeti anyways.

3865
04:41:42,720 --> 04:41:46,360
Yeah, I got you.

3866
04:41:46,360 --> 04:41:50,520
You want Spellbreaker?

3867
04:41:54,430 --> 04:41:56,990
It's splitting up a little bit here.

3868
04:41:56,990 --> 04:42:11,500
Spellbreaker it is.

3869
04:42:11,500 --> 04:42:13,020
Always Antique Healbot.

3870
04:42:13,020 --> 04:42:45,799
You have to zoom in more.

3871
04:42:45,799 --> 04:42:47,080
Why are you clicking up here?

3872
04:42:47,080 --> 04:42:48,119
What are you guys doing?

3873
04:42:49,080 --> 04:42:52,279
Have I lost all faith in this right now?

3874
04:43:15,950 --> 04:43:20,830
Webinize Pinata.

3875
04:43:20,830 --> 04:43:24,430
I'm going to go 0-3 again because of this.

3876
04:43:24,430 --> 04:43:34,520
I'm about to step in here.

3877
04:43:34,520 --> 04:43:36,919
Choose a card equals Jerma's Choice.

3878
04:43:36,919 --> 04:43:37,479
Oh, nice.

3879
04:43:37,479 --> 04:43:38,439
That's a good idea.

3880
04:43:38,439 --> 04:43:39,740
Not like it matters.

3881
04:43:40,299 --> 04:43:42,060
12 of these cards have been awful.

3882
04:43:42,060 --> 04:43:44,830
You're going to go 0-3 because you're bad.

3883
04:43:44,830 --> 04:44:02,799
Now I'm going to go 0-3 because I just picked Weaponized Pinata.

3884
04:44:02,799 --> 04:44:09,529
Light's Justice.

3885
04:44:09,529 --> 04:44:26,110
Now I know you guys are just fucking with me.

3886
04:44:26,110 --> 04:44:26,750
What a joke.

3887
04:44:26,750 --> 04:44:29,240
This is worse than the last one.

3888
04:44:29,240 --> 04:44:42,860
This deck actually might be worse than the first one.

3889
04:44:42,860 --> 04:44:44,380
All right, we don't have very much.

3890
04:44:44,380 --> 04:44:46,540
We got like 13 more to do.

3891
04:44:46,540 --> 04:44:53,279
This is a tough one.

3892
04:44:53,279 --> 04:44:54,400
Actually, all these are good.

3893
04:44:54,400 --> 04:45:01,040
People are just clicking the golden card.

3894
04:45:09,900 --> 04:45:12,380
Three, two, one.

3895
04:45:12,380 --> 04:45:15,419
You gave us this power?

3896
04:45:15,419 --> 04:45:17,659
Yeah, and I'm going to try to at least win one game.

3897
04:45:17,659 --> 04:45:23,659
If I can go like two and two or two and three, I'll be happy.

3898
04:45:23,659 --> 04:45:29,959
Do three damage to all minions.

3899
04:45:29,959 --> 04:45:41,200
Jesus, this is close.

3900
04:45:41,200 --> 04:45:44,639
Say the name out loud of whichever card you want them to click.

3901
04:45:44,639 --> 04:45:45,520
It's not that hard.

3902
04:45:48,919 --> 04:45:56,200
I think you underestimate this community, okay?

3903
04:45:56,200 --> 04:45:56,759
I'll show you.

3904
04:46:01,659 --> 04:46:10,119
Please everybody click on Muster for Battle.

3905
04:46:10,119 --> 04:46:10,919
No, no, no, no, no.

3906
04:46:10,919 --> 04:46:12,759
Click on any other card.

3907
04:46:12,759 --> 04:46:13,319
Any other card.

3908
04:46:13,319 --> 04:46:14,200
I don't want that.

3909
04:46:14,200 --> 04:46:24,669
I want Minibot or...

3910
04:46:24,669 --> 04:46:36,569
Hey, please click on Shielded Minibot.

3911
04:46:36,569 --> 04:46:37,209
See?

3912
04:46:37,209 --> 04:46:38,250
Only 9%.

3913
04:46:38,250 --> 04:46:38,810
Hold on.

3914
04:46:38,810 --> 04:46:40,880
We're doing this again.

3915
04:46:40,880 --> 04:46:44,860
Everyone click on True Silver Champion.

3916
04:46:44,860 --> 04:46:50,189
If True Silver Champion does not have at least 40% of the vote,

3917
04:46:50,189 --> 04:46:51,310
the stream is turning off.

3918
04:47:09,389 --> 04:47:09,950
See, look at this.

3919
04:47:12,720 --> 04:47:16,750
Look at these anarchists over here.

3920
04:47:16,750 --> 04:47:18,909
15% just want this to turn off.

3921
04:47:19,549 --> 04:47:21,630
38% are just like, is he bluffing?

3922
04:47:21,630 --> 04:47:43,229
We got 47% good boys and good girls.

3923
04:47:43,229 --> 04:47:44,110
Hurry up.

3924
04:47:44,110 --> 04:47:52,240
This is part of the experience.

3925
04:47:52,240 --> 04:47:55,630
Bomblobber or Argent Protector?

3926
04:47:58,250 --> 04:48:02,299
This is very mid-heavy.

3927
04:48:02,299 --> 04:48:03,740
This experience is boring.

3928
04:48:03,740 --> 04:48:06,650
Hey, what?

3929
04:48:12,250 --> 04:48:12,889
It's boring.

3930
04:48:12,889 --> 04:48:18,860
It is.

3931
04:48:18,860 --> 04:48:23,020
Well, it won't be long now until it's over.

3932
04:48:23,020 --> 04:48:23,659
Which one was it?

3933
04:48:23,659 --> 04:48:33,529
Argent Protector, right?

3934
04:48:33,529 --> 04:48:34,650
We can't see the deck.

3935
04:48:37,069 --> 04:48:40,349
Well, if you had not been goofing around so much,

3936
04:48:40,349 --> 04:48:42,110
we wouldn't be so zoomed in.

3937
04:48:42,110 --> 04:48:52,959
You guys were goofing around.

3938
04:48:52,959 --> 04:48:56,319
All right, only like seven more cards to pick up.

3939
04:48:56,319 --> 04:49:05,520
You're the kind of person that punishes one person,

3940
04:49:05,520 --> 04:49:07,360
the whole class for one person's mistake.

3941
04:49:09,849 --> 04:49:12,159
I'm fairly certain it would be...

3942
04:49:12,159 --> 04:49:12,799
Okay, hold on.

3943
04:49:12,799 --> 04:49:15,389
I don't know if I don't agree with that.

3944
04:49:15,389 --> 04:49:18,270
It was like 38% of people in the classroom

3945
04:49:18,270 --> 04:49:20,189
were all throwing coins at me.

3946
04:49:24,669 --> 04:49:25,549
I'm going to keep everybody

3947
04:49:25,549 --> 04:49:27,069
and we're going to have a long discussion about it.

3948
04:49:30,240 --> 04:49:31,759
It was like more than 40%.

3949
04:49:38,509 --> 04:49:39,470
Sun River Spy.

3950
04:49:40,029 --> 04:49:43,119
Do we even have a secret?

3951
04:49:43,119 --> 04:49:45,069
I'm just being sabotaged.

3952
04:49:57,389 --> 04:49:58,750
We can't see the deck.

3953
04:50:00,299 --> 04:50:02,060
Okay, hold on.

3954
04:50:02,060 --> 04:50:07,880
You guys have learned your lesson.

3955
04:50:07,880 --> 04:50:08,360
Secrets.

3956
04:50:09,000 --> 04:50:09,639
Sacrifice.

3957
04:50:10,279 --> 04:50:11,840
All right, let me pull...

3958
04:50:11,840 --> 04:50:14,029
Hold on, let me pull this back.

3959
04:50:14,029 --> 04:50:14,509
There you go.

3960
04:50:14,509 --> 04:50:16,680
Now you can see the deck.

3961
04:50:16,680 --> 04:50:18,220
So, see?

3962
04:50:18,220 --> 04:50:19,340
This is what we got to work with.

3963
04:50:19,340 --> 04:50:20,700
Pretty balanced so far.

3964
04:50:20,700 --> 04:50:22,639
I almost just instantly clicked the zoom up.

3965
04:50:33,099 --> 04:50:35,259
I mean, why are you punishing all of us

3966
04:50:35,259 --> 04:50:36,939
for the mistake of one person?

3967
04:50:37,500 --> 04:50:42,409
Oh, but yeah, I threw a rock into the blackboard.

3968
04:50:42,409 --> 04:50:44,330
And so did the person next to me,

3969
04:50:44,330 --> 04:50:46,009
to the right and next to me to the left.

3970
04:50:46,009 --> 04:50:47,209
And two people behind me.

3971
04:50:47,209 --> 04:50:48,729
And three people in the front.

3972
04:50:48,729 --> 04:50:51,000
How many people are in the classroom?

3973
04:50:52,110 --> 04:50:53,950
There's like 26 people in the classroom.

3974
04:50:54,669 --> 04:50:57,709
Like 13 or 14 of us threw rocks.

3975
04:50:57,709 --> 04:50:58,750
Why are you punishing me?

3976
04:50:59,389 --> 04:51:00,110
One person.

3977
04:51:00,669 --> 04:51:12,669
These last ones got a count.

3978
04:51:16,919 --> 04:51:17,560
Kick out...

3979
04:51:17,560 --> 04:51:18,680
Yeah, half you guys are getting

3980
04:51:18,680 --> 04:51:20,520
going to the principal's office.

3981
04:51:20,520 --> 04:51:29,020
Jeremy, we all hate you.

3982
04:51:29,020 --> 04:51:31,659
This deck is fucking terrible.

3983
04:51:35,580 --> 04:51:37,580
This is randomized cards.

3984
04:51:38,540 --> 04:51:39,819
I'm taking the crocodile.

3985
04:51:40,779 --> 04:51:41,900
I'm picking the next ones.

3986
04:51:41,900 --> 04:51:43,259
I'm going to try to salvage this.

3987
04:51:43,259 --> 04:51:43,979
It's over.

3988
04:51:43,979 --> 04:51:54,400
All right, you can pick this a lot.

3989
04:51:54,400 --> 04:51:54,880
I don't know.

3990
04:51:54,880 --> 04:51:55,439
I have no idea.

3991
04:51:55,439 --> 04:51:56,240
I don't know half these do.

3992
04:52:00,569 --> 04:52:01,450
This one's...

3993
04:52:01,450 --> 04:52:05,840
Murloc Knight is like really, really good.

3994
04:52:05,840 --> 04:52:07,360
50-50 split.

3995
04:52:07,360 --> 04:52:10,119
True Silver Champ.

3996
04:52:10,119 --> 04:52:11,000
Consecration.

3997
04:52:11,000 --> 04:52:12,939
All right, we're good.

3998
04:52:12,939 --> 04:52:14,700
Boys and girls, it's time.

3999
04:52:15,340 --> 04:52:18,750
Check hero portrait.

4000
04:52:18,750 --> 04:52:19,680
What about it?

4001
04:52:25,319 --> 04:52:27,400
You took the last three expansions

4002
04:52:27,400 --> 04:52:28,360
through dice in the air.

4003
04:52:28,360 --> 04:52:30,680
Like 200 dice and just gave random cards.

4004
04:52:30,680 --> 04:52:31,560
None of these work together.

4005
04:52:34,889 --> 04:52:36,169
I'm going to go 0 and 3 again

4006
04:52:36,169 --> 04:52:37,689
or like 1 and 3.

4007
04:52:37,689 --> 04:52:39,290
And everyone's going to make fun of me.

4008
04:52:39,290 --> 04:52:41,360
This is what I...

4009
04:52:41,360 --> 04:52:42,159
We're going to have to work with.

4010
04:52:42,159 --> 04:52:43,680
I have to bake a cake with cement

4011
04:52:44,490 --> 04:52:45,689
and feed it to people.

4012
04:52:45,689 --> 04:52:51,759
Let's go.

4013
04:52:51,759 --> 04:53:02,540
Quick retire to redo the deck.

4014
04:53:02,540 --> 04:53:02,939
I'm not.

4015
04:53:03,900 --> 04:53:04,939
You're not going to get me with that one.

4016
04:53:15,500 --> 04:53:16,139
I'm not going to sit here

4017
04:53:16,139 --> 04:53:17,340
and get berated by a teacher

4018
04:53:17,340 --> 04:53:20,139
who picked Steel Ranger.

4019
04:53:22,860 --> 04:53:23,740
We'll be alone.

4020
04:53:24,779 --> 04:53:28,009
I'm going for it.

4021
04:53:28,009 --> 04:53:28,889
And you know what?

4022
04:53:28,889 --> 04:53:30,250
Even if I make bogus plays,

4023
04:53:30,250 --> 04:53:31,689
I'm going to trust myself

4024
04:53:31,689 --> 04:53:32,490
and I'm going to play.

4025
04:53:33,290 --> 04:53:34,729
This deck is so bad.

4026
04:53:35,450 --> 04:53:36,169
So bad.

4027
04:53:36,810 --> 04:53:37,770
It is the worst deck

4028
04:53:37,770 --> 04:53:39,450
I think I've ever seen in the game.

4029
04:53:39,450 --> 04:53:42,509
I mean, you guys have truly outdone yourselves.

4030
04:53:46,560 --> 04:53:49,240
I picked this one.

4031
04:53:49,240 --> 04:53:49,959
But I'm, you know,

4032
04:53:49,959 --> 04:53:51,959
I'm going to block out all the negative energy.

4033
04:53:51,959 --> 04:53:53,479
I'm going to just play

4034
04:53:53,479 --> 04:53:55,000
even if I make mistakes.

4035
04:53:55,000 --> 04:53:56,279
You guys aren't even here with me.

4036
04:53:56,279 --> 04:53:56,759
I'm here.

4037
04:53:56,759 --> 04:53:58,439
I'm just looking at the screen by myself.

4038
04:53:58,439 --> 04:54:00,439
It's just me and this guy in a room together

4039
04:54:00,439 --> 04:54:01,639
with a chess board in front of us.

4040
04:54:02,360 --> 04:54:03,799
So with that being said,

4041
04:54:11,919 --> 04:54:13,759
I'm just, it's just me in the game.

4042
04:54:13,759 --> 04:54:14,479
Me in the cards.

4043
04:54:15,119 --> 04:54:17,389
I got the sunglasses on.

4044
04:54:19,720 --> 04:54:23,209
All right, that's fine.

4045
04:54:23,770 --> 04:54:26,000
Let me take a look here.

4046
04:54:26,000 --> 04:54:26,959
Okay, bingo.

4047
04:54:31,319 --> 04:54:32,360
Don't silence that.

4048
04:54:45,720 --> 04:54:46,360
Don't listen to that.

4049
04:54:46,360 --> 04:54:46,919
I can hear them,

4050
04:54:46,919 --> 04:54:50,119
but I can't, I can see their mouths moving,

4051
04:54:50,119 --> 04:54:50,840
but I can't hear them.

4052
04:54:53,639 --> 04:54:54,439
Wrong, wrong.

4053
04:54:55,000 --> 04:54:55,639
Not going to get it.

4054
04:54:57,439 --> 04:54:59,759
Absolutely fucking fantastic.

4055
04:54:59,759 --> 04:55:00,240
Keep it up.

4056
04:55:10,520 --> 04:55:11,959
I'm not in reading chat.

4057
04:55:11,959 --> 04:55:14,400
I'm playing this as if it was me in the bed.

4058
04:55:15,119 --> 04:55:23,150
Let me see what you guys say.

4059
04:55:32,720 --> 04:55:34,080
Let's all leave.

4060
04:55:34,080 --> 04:55:36,880
Oh, no, I'm not supposed to be looking at you.

4061
04:55:37,599 --> 04:55:41,819
I'm going to silence that.

4062
04:55:43,580 --> 04:55:45,500
No, give each player a spare part.

4063
04:55:45,500 --> 04:55:46,060
I want one.

4064
04:55:53,000 --> 04:55:54,279
I don't think there are any secrets

4065
04:55:54,279 --> 04:55:54,840
in the whole deck.

4066
04:56:09,470 --> 04:56:10,430
Miss, hit the 1-1.

4067
04:56:11,069 --> 04:56:11,849
Do it again.

4068
04:56:13,049 --> 04:56:13,770
That's perfect.

4069
04:56:13,770 --> 04:56:14,650
I'm fine with that.

4070
04:56:14,650 --> 04:56:16,250
I got avenging wrath coming up here.

4071
04:56:22,430 --> 04:56:24,909
This is a, like when you take a picture

4072
04:56:25,470 --> 04:56:26,990
of an avenging wrath turn,

4073
04:56:27,470 --> 04:56:28,189
it's this one.

4074
04:56:28,990 --> 04:56:53,369
I'm not looking.

4075
04:56:53,369 --> 04:56:54,250
I'm not looking over there.

4076
04:57:19,069 --> 04:57:23,040
Okay, now I think I'm going to taunt up this.

4077
04:57:23,840 --> 04:57:26,729
Or no.

4078
04:57:26,729 --> 04:57:28,409
Um, no, get it up.

4079
04:57:28,409 --> 04:57:28,810
Get more.

4080
04:57:31,610 --> 04:57:39,630
I'm going to fucking 100 all.

4081
04:57:39,630 --> 04:57:40,509
I'm busy.

4082
04:57:40,509 --> 04:57:41,229
I'm busy.

4083
04:57:42,349 --> 04:57:42,909
I can't.

4084
04:57:44,520 --> 04:57:45,400
I'm busy.

4085
04:57:50,700 --> 04:57:52,459
Mom, mom, I'm in the bathroom.

4086
04:57:54,909 --> 04:57:55,869
Mom just comes over

4087
04:57:55,869 --> 04:57:58,349
and slides a hundred dollar bill under the bathroom.

4088
04:57:58,349 --> 04:58:00,990
I've been in the toilet for like fucking 45 minutes

4089
04:58:00,990 --> 04:58:03,229
and mom slides a hundred under the bathroom door.

4090
04:58:04,029 --> 04:58:04,830
Mom, stop it.

4091
04:58:04,830 --> 04:58:05,549
Get out of here.

4092
04:58:10,189 --> 04:58:11,869
Uh, no, that was flutters.

4093
04:58:11,869 --> 04:58:14,750
Thank you so much for the fucking hundred dollars flutters.

4094
04:58:15,310 --> 04:58:18,080
Been a fan of you and stir

4095
04:58:18,080 --> 04:58:19,599
for the better part of six years.

4096
04:58:19,599 --> 04:58:20,799
I love your content and keep it up.

4097
04:58:20,799 --> 04:58:21,919
Thank you so much.

4098
04:58:21,919 --> 04:58:22,959
Glad to have you.

4099
04:58:22,959 --> 04:58:24,479
You've been around for a long time.

4100
04:58:24,479 --> 04:58:25,849
What do I do?

4101
04:58:25,849 --> 04:58:34,400
And then I'm going to taunt.

4102
04:58:34,959 --> 04:58:36,080
Which one do I taunt though?

4103
04:58:37,150 --> 04:58:38,110
I'm itching my head.

4104
04:58:38,110 --> 04:58:39,310
I'm turning fucking crazy.

4105
04:58:39,869 --> 04:58:42,750
Taunt the storm and I think that's what I would do.

4106
04:58:47,799 --> 04:58:48,200
I win.

4107
04:58:49,360 --> 04:58:50,319
You said it couldn't be done.

4108
04:58:51,040 --> 04:58:52,840
It's one game.

4109
04:58:52,840 --> 04:58:53,319
Relax.

4110
04:58:53,959 --> 04:59:18,270
Melanie is okay.

4111
04:59:19,069 --> 04:59:20,799
He's getting a little desperate.

4112
04:59:23,630 --> 04:59:23,950
Okay.

4113
04:59:24,750 --> 04:59:25,470
We're so close.

4114
04:59:25,470 --> 04:59:26,349
Here comes the murloc.

4115
04:59:27,790 --> 04:59:40,479
I ran him a legendary minion to your hand.

4116
04:59:40,479 --> 04:59:41,119
I can do them both.

4117
04:59:55,259 --> 04:59:55,819
Job done.

4118
05:00:10,430 --> 05:00:11,229
Greed is good.

4119
05:00:11,229 --> 05:00:12,110
Greed is good.

4120
05:00:12,110 --> 05:00:12,830
Greed is good.

4121
05:00:13,869 --> 05:00:23,630
1 and 0.

4122
05:00:23,630 --> 05:00:24,110
Oh fuck!

4123
05:00:24,110 --> 05:00:25,229
That did 25 damage!

4124
05:00:33,599 --> 05:00:34,400
Not 0 and 3.

4125
05:00:37,639 --> 05:00:38,680
1 and 0 actually.

4126
05:00:43,290 --> 05:00:44,889
This deck is giving me the middle finger.

4127
05:00:45,919 --> 05:00:47,200
You guys didn't even try to do that

4128
05:00:47,200 --> 05:00:48,400
and that's what you've done.

4129
05:00:48,400 --> 05:01:04,110
It's going to be 1 and 3.

4130
05:01:06,520 --> 05:01:07,479
Not yet.

4131
05:01:07,479 --> 05:01:07,959
1 and 0.

4132
05:01:10,119 --> 05:01:12,040
Let the hunt begin.

4133
05:01:12,040 --> 05:01:14,409
Night with honor.

4134
05:01:14,409 --> 05:01:16,119
See this is to trust myself.

4135
05:01:16,119 --> 05:01:17,959
Even if the plays are not perfect.

4136
05:01:18,939 --> 05:01:20,540
This is 2, 3, 4, 5.

4137
05:01:21,500 --> 05:01:22,540
I shouldn't do anything.

4138
05:01:23,099 --> 05:01:27,229
I get a perfect mana curve every turn.

4139
05:01:27,229 --> 05:01:46,909
I was gonna say if that was a 1.

4140
05:01:47,709 --> 05:01:54,409
All right.

4141
05:01:54,409 --> 05:01:54,970
Again.

4142
05:01:54,970 --> 05:01:55,369
Focus.

4143
05:01:56,250 --> 05:02:03,040
Coin out the exorcist.

4144
05:02:04,159 --> 05:02:04,400
No.

4145
05:02:13,880 --> 05:02:14,599
Good.

4146
05:02:14,599 --> 05:02:16,830
Play the curve.

4147
05:02:16,830 --> 05:02:18,509
I'm not looking at you guys.

4148
05:02:18,509 --> 05:02:18,909
Hold on.

4149
05:02:19,470 --> 05:02:24,680
I'm just gonna play the curve.

4150
05:02:24,680 --> 05:02:33,869
That's okay.

4151
05:02:34,590 --> 05:02:40,759
Although I could true silver this.

4152
05:02:46,939 --> 05:02:54,509
I got my steel rager.

4153
05:02:54,509 --> 05:02:56,349
The thing that everyone was laughing at me for.

4154
05:02:57,069 --> 05:02:58,349
We'll see if they're laughing now

4155
05:02:58,349 --> 05:03:01,229
when he drops a fucking thick 2, 5 right now.

4156
05:03:06,110 --> 05:03:06,830
They're not laughing.

4157
05:03:08,509 --> 05:03:17,360
Let's see.

4158
05:03:20,700 --> 05:03:28,250
I'm just gonna taunt.

4159
05:03:30,409 --> 05:03:32,169
Let me taunt and kill this.

4160
05:03:46,380 --> 05:03:47,580
I don't want him to have any minions.

4161
05:03:47,580 --> 05:03:48,860
I don't care if he kills this.

4162
05:03:48,860 --> 05:03:49,900
He's a hunter.

4163
05:03:50,459 --> 05:03:58,909
I got boulder frisk coming up here

4164
05:03:58,909 --> 05:04:00,990
and I've got jouster.

4165
05:04:00,990 --> 05:04:02,110
I got jouster right now.

4166
05:04:02,750 --> 05:04:03,709
Oh, that's not good.

4167
05:04:16,409 --> 05:04:18,009
I mean if it is snipe then

4168
05:04:19,849 --> 05:04:27,799
will this trigger it?

4169
05:04:28,750 --> 05:04:29,389
If it is snipe.

4170
05:04:36,750 --> 05:04:37,069
Come on.

4171
05:04:37,069 --> 05:04:37,950
Give me that health.

4172
05:04:37,950 --> 05:04:38,270
Yes.

4173
05:04:44,599 --> 05:04:45,000
Wait.

4174
05:04:45,000 --> 05:04:47,000
Somebody say snipe is not in arena.

4175
05:04:49,919 --> 05:04:53,959
I'm gonna go with this.

4176
05:05:00,270 --> 05:05:02,990
It's not.

4177
05:05:05,150 --> 05:05:07,240
What's going on?

4178
05:05:07,240 --> 05:05:07,479
All right.

4179
05:05:07,479 --> 05:05:07,880
Here we go.

4180
05:05:07,880 --> 05:05:25,790
Okay.

4181
05:05:25,790 --> 05:05:26,430
We're good.

4182
05:05:26,430 --> 05:05:26,830
We're good.

4183
05:05:47,819 --> 05:05:48,619
Was he being mean?

4184
05:05:48,619 --> 05:05:49,500
Was that mean?

4185
05:05:49,500 --> 05:05:50,729
No.

4186
05:05:50,729 --> 05:05:52,009
I get the minions out of here.

4187
05:05:52,009 --> 05:05:53,130
I gotta get rid of those minions.

4188
05:06:03,610 --> 05:06:04,409
Oh never mind.

4189
05:06:04,409 --> 05:06:05,770
We gave it rush.

4190
05:06:05,770 --> 05:06:11,479
I was gonna say the steel erasure

4191
05:06:11,479 --> 05:06:13,240
seems pretty good right now doesn't it?

4192
05:06:13,240 --> 05:06:17,759
I'm gonna do bear into silver moon portal.

4193
05:06:26,560 --> 05:06:27,360
Excellent.

4194
05:06:27,360 --> 05:06:44,119
So what is this secret then?

4195
05:06:44,119 --> 05:06:45,639
I'm not familiar with some of the newer secrets.

4196
05:06:56,119 --> 05:06:57,560
Is rat trap the one where if you play

4197
05:06:57,560 --> 05:07:01,759
too many cards in a hand return

4198
05:07:01,759 --> 05:07:05,119
it'll summon like a big rat.

4199
05:07:05,119 --> 05:07:05,759
Three cards.

4200
05:07:05,759 --> 05:07:06,000
Okay.

4201
05:07:10,270 --> 05:07:11,310
He's thinking.

4202
05:07:11,310 --> 05:07:16,240
There's another one.

4203
05:07:25,709 --> 05:07:25,869
All right.

4204
05:07:25,869 --> 05:07:26,909
So we're gonna test.

4205
05:07:26,909 --> 05:07:28,189
I'm gonna send him straight in.

4206
05:07:28,909 --> 05:07:31,020
All right.

4207
05:07:31,020 --> 05:07:32,700
And it is explosive.

4208
05:07:33,340 --> 05:07:35,290
Bring out the rager.

4209
05:07:37,450 --> 05:07:38,569
Rager gets rid of this guy.

4210
05:07:45,770 --> 05:07:46,169
Uh oh.

4211
05:07:46,810 --> 05:07:47,849
It's snake trap.

4212
05:07:48,409 --> 05:07:49,959
Interesting.

4213
05:07:50,520 --> 05:07:56,680
I thought it was rat trap.

4214
05:08:08,380 --> 05:08:14,970
Why did it have to be snakes?

4215
05:08:15,610 --> 05:08:30,639
You don't get to do that twice do you?

4216
05:08:34,330 --> 05:08:37,319
All right.

4217
05:08:37,319 --> 05:08:39,479
I got I still have some pretty great minions here.

4218
05:08:39,479 --> 05:08:41,959
I got ogre and uh and stalker coming up next.

4219
05:08:55,869 --> 05:08:56,830
Silence the snake.

4220
05:08:57,470 --> 05:08:58,990
Why I'm not gonna do that.

4221
05:08:58,990 --> 05:09:07,360
A lot of rush.

4222
05:09:12,650 --> 05:09:13,209
Well all right.

4223
05:09:13,209 --> 05:09:13,770
Let's see here.

4224
05:09:15,080 --> 05:09:17,799
I could just flood the board and just go face and win.

4225
05:09:27,900 --> 05:09:34,540
That makes more sense.

4226
05:09:36,459 --> 05:09:44,299
Let's see.

4227
05:09:44,299 --> 05:09:45,020
Got anything else?

4228
05:09:53,040 --> 05:09:54,319
Or did I did I win?

4229
05:09:54,319 --> 05:09:54,959
You got a taunt?

4230
05:09:54,959 --> 05:09:55,759
You got a spell?

4231
05:09:56,400 --> 05:09:57,680
Are we two and oh?

4232
05:10:01,229 --> 05:10:01,630
All right.

4233
05:10:02,669 --> 05:10:03,150
All right.

4234
05:10:03,150 --> 05:10:03,470
Okay.

4235
05:10:04,029 --> 05:10:05,470
Um game over.

4236
05:10:05,470 --> 05:10:18,990
Let's well play.

4237
05:10:18,990 --> 05:10:24,490
Two and oh.

4238
05:10:24,490 --> 05:10:27,450
Now he's gonna go two and three right?

4239
05:10:27,450 --> 05:10:28,650
That's what you're gonna say.

4240
05:10:28,650 --> 05:10:29,369
Yeah there it is.

4241
05:10:34,919 --> 05:10:36,759
Even if I get to like 11 and oh.

4242
05:10:37,400 --> 05:10:38,700
It's not gonna happen.

4243
05:10:47,880 --> 05:10:56,939
Well there's the squire.

4244
05:10:57,500 --> 05:11:03,020
Here comes a mirror match.

4245
05:11:03,740 --> 05:11:04,959
That's not good.

4246
05:11:05,520 --> 05:11:10,729
Oh that was a juicy one.

4247
05:11:10,729 --> 05:11:29,020
Juicy one buddy.

4248
05:11:29,020 --> 05:11:31,450
Coin taunt.

4249
05:11:31,450 --> 05:11:36,700
That's oh there's only it's supposed to one attack.

4250
05:11:36,700 --> 05:11:53,639
Okay I'm not paying attention.

4251
05:11:53,639 --> 05:11:55,000
I know they're probably making fun of you right now.

4252
05:11:55,000 --> 05:11:55,959
But don't let them make fun of you.

4253
05:11:56,840 --> 05:11:58,759
It was the right call.

4254
05:12:18,319 --> 05:12:19,479
It's okay.

4255
05:12:21,759 --> 05:12:22,560
Gotta get in there.

4256
05:12:23,599 --> 05:12:24,479
All right hold on.

4257
05:12:25,040 --> 05:12:26,000
Hold on just a second.

4258
05:12:26,560 --> 05:12:30,430
I mean let's not be hasty here.

4259
05:12:35,229 --> 05:12:36,349
Not the time for equality.

4260
05:12:39,709 --> 05:12:41,709
Why is this so much mana?

4261
05:12:41,709 --> 05:12:42,909
Did it just be two mana?

4262
05:13:03,979 --> 05:13:05,020
Uh do I hit?

4263
05:13:05,020 --> 05:13:05,500
I don't.

4264
05:13:06,299 --> 05:13:07,580
No don't do anything.

4265
05:13:08,139 --> 05:13:12,360
He's gonna get greedy.

4266
05:13:12,360 --> 05:13:13,159
He's gonna hit me in the face.

4267
05:13:21,930 --> 05:13:24,400
Okay not greedy.

4268
05:13:25,119 --> 05:13:26,319
I have a consecration in here.

4269
05:13:27,040 --> 05:13:27,599
Where is it?

4270
05:13:32,909 --> 05:13:34,430
Oh fuck I forgot what that thing did.

4271
05:13:45,290 --> 05:13:50,520
Um do I kill this or do I let him kill it?

4272
05:13:50,520 --> 05:13:50,840
Maybe.

4273
05:13:53,500 --> 05:14:00,169
All right now just attack me in the face with that 5-1.

4274
05:14:05,549 --> 05:14:08,430
I'm in a good spot but it's not a terrible spot.

4275
05:14:09,229 --> 05:14:10,040
Could be worse.

4276
05:14:17,439 --> 05:14:19,200
Why is everyone doing the flat liner?

4277
05:14:21,560 --> 05:14:23,720
Oh you're saying here the flat liners.

4278
05:14:35,419 --> 05:14:37,419
If I get a consecration right here this is...

4279
05:14:38,459 --> 05:14:41,040
I remember you could do the quality consecrate.

4280
05:14:42,319 --> 05:14:43,040
That's not good.

4281
05:14:47,369 --> 05:14:49,130
I mean this is the only play is this.

4282
05:14:49,930 --> 05:15:02,380
2-1.

4283
05:15:03,959 --> 05:15:05,639
You guys aren't very supportive are you?

4284
05:15:08,299 --> 05:15:08,799
Shit.

4285
05:15:11,790 --> 05:15:13,150
I need consecration.

4286
05:15:13,150 --> 05:15:13,790
It's in here.

4287
05:15:25,439 --> 05:15:32,159
That's not consecration but it can at least take out the mechanical yeti.

4288
05:15:46,680 --> 05:15:47,799
How did this happen?

4289
05:15:51,470 --> 05:15:53,470
I started out with bad plays.

4290
05:15:54,110 --> 05:15:55,310
I started out with bad cards.

4291
05:15:56,520 --> 05:15:58,520
This is not over yet.

4292
05:15:58,520 --> 05:16:00,279
I just have to draw a consecration.

4293
05:16:00,919 --> 05:16:02,200
We're back to square one.

4294
05:16:08,270 --> 05:16:11,310
If I draw a consecration right now the board is empty.

4295
05:16:16,159 --> 05:16:18,680
That's not consecration.

4296
05:16:18,680 --> 05:16:19,159
That's it.

4297
05:16:36,560 --> 05:16:41,919
2-1.

4298
05:16:41,919 --> 05:16:43,119
Sometimes you lose them.

4299
05:16:43,119 --> 05:16:43,680
It's all right.

4300
05:16:43,680 --> 05:16:44,240
We'll get it back.

4301
05:16:50,459 --> 05:16:51,419
We'll get them next time.

4302
05:16:51,419 --> 05:16:51,819
We will.

4303
05:16:55,529 --> 05:16:57,209
Yeah we have exponentially improved.

4304
05:16:58,779 --> 05:17:00,540
This was a 0-3 stream.

4305
05:17:00,540 --> 05:17:02,060
It's now a 2-1 stream.

4306
05:17:03,180 --> 05:17:06,860
Imagine improving by 2-300%.

4307
05:17:08,139 --> 05:17:09,659
Over the course of five hours.

4308
05:17:10,669 --> 05:17:12,110
That's a large increase.

4309
05:17:12,830 --> 05:17:36,639
200% of zero is zero.

4310
05:17:36,639 --> 05:17:38,319
Now the zero and three was like...

4311
05:17:39,869 --> 05:17:41,229
It wasn't actually zero.

4312
05:17:41,229 --> 05:17:42,669
It was like zero point...

4313
05:17:42,669 --> 05:17:43,470
What the hell was that?

4314
05:17:45,880 --> 05:17:46,380
Oh.

4315
05:17:55,119 --> 05:18:00,299
It was like 0.4-3.

4316
05:18:01,259 --> 05:18:03,259
So 200% of that is like...

4317
05:18:03,259 --> 05:18:04,060
We're doing fine.

4318
05:18:11,319 --> 05:18:14,009
That's the wrong one.

4319
05:18:14,009 --> 05:18:15,529
You picked the wrong one to do that too.

4320
05:18:17,529 --> 05:18:26,159
Mathematically it was zero but emotionally it was a bigger number.

4321
05:18:26,159 --> 05:18:26,659
Yes.

4322
05:18:27,360 --> 05:18:38,619
Okay.

4323
05:18:38,619 --> 05:18:41,819
I think I'm gonna just throw out the weaponized pinata.

4324
05:18:41,819 --> 05:18:44,909
In fact I am.

4325
05:18:47,790 --> 05:18:56,439
This is a good Fortnite reference.

4326
05:18:57,080 --> 05:19:00,430
Have you guys even ever played Fortnite?

4327
05:19:00,430 --> 05:19:03,150
I see so many references but I don't think you guys even play it.

4328
05:19:12,919 --> 05:19:13,639
Ooh.

4329
05:19:13,639 --> 05:19:14,520
All right.

4330
05:19:14,520 --> 05:19:15,319
What's more important?

4331
05:19:16,119 --> 05:19:19,159
Two and two and a two cost minion or getting a taunt out and hitting the face?

4332
05:19:21,209 --> 05:19:21,930
That's cooler to me.

4333
05:19:22,810 --> 05:19:30,000
Things are looking up.

4334
05:19:35,290 --> 05:19:36,810
A good bolderfist ogre coming out next.

4335
05:19:37,529 --> 05:19:47,770
Do I get these next turn?

4336
05:19:47,770 --> 05:19:52,250
My remedies are all natural.

4337
05:19:53,610 --> 05:19:54,810
No he has to trade.

4338
05:19:55,610 --> 05:19:56,720
He's gonna lose both.

4339
05:19:59,500 --> 05:20:01,500
I mean yeah he can draw all he wants.

4340
05:20:01,500 --> 05:20:04,619
He's dead next turn.

4341
05:20:09,689 --> 05:20:11,290
Where did he get this like synergy from?

4342
05:20:12,009 --> 05:20:28,619
This is a pretty good spot.

4343
05:20:29,180 --> 05:20:38,319
He drew a bunch of cards.

4344
05:20:38,319 --> 05:20:47,130
Right now he's thinking oh fuck he's got big damage.

4345
05:20:47,130 --> 05:20:48,729
See I'm all right with that.

4346
05:20:48,729 --> 05:20:50,169
We're getting the legendary out of this.

4347
05:20:50,810 --> 05:20:52,799
He had to take a lot of hits for that.

4348
05:20:52,799 --> 05:20:53,279
What do we got?

4349
05:20:56,669 --> 05:20:57,950
Varian Rin.

4350
05:20:58,669 --> 05:21:03,849
Hahaha that could be the victory right there.

4351
05:21:07,319 --> 05:21:10,680
I mean we're gonna obviously we're gonna divine shield the ogre right?

4352
05:21:10,680 --> 05:21:11,959
I mean we got a good play here.

4353
05:21:13,479 --> 05:21:17,900
Divine shield the ogre taunt or taunt divine shield the taunt.

4354
05:21:27,790 --> 05:21:29,389
And then get it out here.

4355
05:21:39,529 --> 05:21:40,569
Next we got Varian.

4356
05:21:58,009 --> 05:22:00,970
That's that don't matter because you ready for this?

4357
05:22:03,840 --> 05:22:04,880
You still have to get through that.

4358
05:22:05,439 --> 05:22:10,459
I'm not gonna I'm not no no no no that's a mistake.

4359
05:22:11,099 --> 05:22:12,509
I'm not gonna play Varian.

4360
05:22:12,509 --> 05:22:13,630
No we're just gonna go face.

4361
05:22:14,270 --> 05:22:16,380
You gotta get through and I got I got the quality.

4362
05:22:21,020 --> 05:22:23,630
Six get rid of you.

4363
05:22:37,500 --> 05:22:39,659
That's there's too many people on the board.

4364
05:22:40,779 --> 05:22:41,580
No I'm not playing it yet.

4365
05:22:42,720 --> 05:22:43,279
I'm not gonna play it.

4366
05:22:43,279 --> 05:22:44,080
No no I'm not playing it.

4367
05:22:44,080 --> 05:22:45,759
There's four there's gonna be I've just draw.

4368
05:22:46,400 --> 05:22:49,979
Should I play it?

4369
05:22:49,979 --> 05:22:51,419
Next turn next turn I'm doing next turn.

4370
05:23:10,240 --> 05:23:10,959
God damn it.

4371
05:23:13,439 --> 05:23:13,919
It's all right.

4372
05:23:19,450 --> 05:23:20,250
Check this shit out.

4373
05:23:20,250 --> 05:23:21,130
You ready?

4374
05:23:21,130 --> 05:23:25,369
I'm gonna I'm gonna equality right now and kill everything.

4375
05:23:25,369 --> 05:23:27,450
And then I'm gonna play Varian next turn.

4376
05:23:27,450 --> 05:23:35,069
Don't do it now.

4377
05:23:35,069 --> 05:23:37,439
I'm doing it right now.

4378
05:23:45,560 --> 05:23:46,060
Good.

4379
05:23:47,979 --> 05:23:48,459
Not good.

4380
05:23:49,180 --> 05:23:50,889
Pretty good.

4381
05:23:50,889 --> 05:23:53,529
All right now we just go face and fucking win the game.

4382
05:24:06,759 --> 05:24:09,000
I got too much with this too much going on here.

4383
05:24:09,000 --> 05:24:25,819
It's too overwhelming and I still have equality.

4384
05:24:25,819 --> 05:24:26,939
16 what's he got?

4385
05:24:27,819 --> 05:24:28,860
What the fuck is this?

4386
05:24:29,580 --> 05:24:31,419
How did you get two of these?

4387
05:24:31,419 --> 05:24:33,180
Hold on what do I have for health?

4388
05:24:33,979 --> 05:24:39,049
How much does this cost?

4389
05:24:39,049 --> 05:24:40,490
That's a six cost minion.

4390
05:24:41,529 --> 05:24:53,259
All right so we've got three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven.

4391
05:24:54,860 --> 05:24:55,340
Twelve.

4392
05:24:56,939 --> 05:24:57,259
Shit.

4393
05:24:59,119 --> 05:25:09,479
Do I just equality and kill everything and then put the face just go off.

4394
05:25:29,099 --> 05:25:30,540
Oh I'm fucking panicking.

4395
05:25:31,180 --> 05:25:41,770
This is okay.

4396
05:25:41,770 --> 05:25:42,490
Yeah this is okay.

4397
05:25:49,689 --> 05:25:51,659
I still have equality.

4398
05:25:53,130 --> 05:25:54,330
If he can summon anything you want.

4399
05:25:54,330 --> 05:25:54,970
No the game's over.

4400
05:25:56,349 --> 05:25:57,549
I don't think he can kill everything.

4401
05:25:59,520 --> 05:26:00,799
Oh god give me a break.

4402
05:26:11,150 --> 05:26:14,349
He's got so many fucking healing synergies.

4403
05:26:19,639 --> 05:26:21,880
Well can I have my consecration now?

4404
05:26:26,479 --> 05:26:28,720
Four five six seven eight nine.

4405
05:26:32,700 --> 05:26:34,459
If I played the stealth goblin I would have won.

4406
05:26:37,259 --> 05:26:38,380
All right I'm gonna kill.

4407
05:26:39,259 --> 05:26:42,080
What the fuck do I want to get rid of here?

4408
05:26:54,279 --> 05:26:55,799
Extended BM.

4409
05:27:01,020 --> 05:27:02,139
Got to kill that seven one.

4410
05:27:25,689 --> 05:27:26,889
What am I doing wrong?

4411
05:27:26,889 --> 05:27:29,259
That was okay that was okay.

4412
05:27:35,799 --> 05:27:39,400
All right you have to remember I'm not very good at this game and I look over here and I see

4413
05:27:40,279 --> 05:27:43,639
like a wall of people fucking holding up notes.

4414
05:27:44,840 --> 05:27:46,279
Sticking them to the wall.

4415
05:27:46,279 --> 05:27:47,080
Hey look at this.

4416
05:27:48,439 --> 05:27:50,040
You have to do it like this quick.

4417
05:27:50,040 --> 05:27:52,919
You got like fucking sticky notes all over my fucking windows.

4418
05:27:53,560 --> 05:27:55,240
And I'm just like panicking.

4419
05:27:55,880 --> 05:28:06,000
Where's my avenging wrath?

4420
05:28:06,639 --> 05:28:08,700
Oh my consecration and I win.

4421
05:28:09,580 --> 05:28:15,560
He forgot about the dragons.

4422
05:28:16,119 --> 05:28:17,930
Oh and then you get equality.

4423
05:28:21,119 --> 05:28:22,000
Equality.

4424
05:28:22,000 --> 05:28:22,720
Dead.

4425
05:28:22,720 --> 05:28:23,360
Two dragons.

4426
05:28:29,119 --> 05:28:31,759
Or face two dragons.

4427
05:28:31,759 --> 05:28:32,959
Noble sacrifice and fuck it.

4428
05:28:57,950 --> 05:29:00,909
I can't like play this with people like watching.

4429
05:29:00,909 --> 05:29:02,270
I seriously.

4430
05:29:03,709 --> 05:29:06,830
I look over I just like I can't focus on the game.

4431
05:29:09,680 --> 05:29:11,599
It's like I need to like concentrate.

4432
05:29:23,450 --> 05:29:24,409
Well there it is.

4433
05:29:24,409 --> 05:29:26,970
Thanks for it fucking five turns late.

4434
05:29:26,970 --> 05:29:46,279
I should have even used the equality.

4435
05:29:46,279 --> 05:29:47,959
Now we're just topdecking against each other.

4436
05:29:47,959 --> 05:29:48,520
I could have won.

4437
05:30:00,669 --> 05:30:05,709
Yeah and I'm also playing with like fucking anvils on my back.

4438
05:30:05,709 --> 05:30:07,310
Look at this guy's deck.

4439
05:30:07,310 --> 05:30:08,270
It's so good.

4440
05:30:09,150 --> 05:30:13,439
I've I've like dragon anvils with this deck.

4441
05:30:14,080 --> 05:30:32,009
I finally played the goblin.

4442
05:30:32,009 --> 05:30:32,810
Oh well.

4443
05:30:32,810 --> 05:30:47,709
I think he's healed like 14-15 times this game.

4444
05:30:48,750 --> 05:30:56,040
Does it still be impossible?

4445
05:30:57,080 --> 05:31:04,330
Why do I have coins?

4446
05:31:04,970 --> 05:31:21,799
What else do I have in here?

4447
05:31:22,360 --> 05:31:23,819
I really could have won too.

4448
05:31:23,819 --> 05:31:25,500
Just I get too overwhelmed.

4449
05:31:26,139 --> 05:31:31,400
This is why I don't play this game.

4450
05:31:43,709 --> 05:31:44,430
Not over yet.

4451
05:31:48,560 --> 05:31:49,840
Hey it ain't over yet.

4452
05:32:11,840 --> 05:32:15,529
It's this this turned into a top deck war.

4453
05:32:15,529 --> 05:32:17,770
Because I didn't play the goblin and half lethal.

4454
05:32:25,720 --> 05:32:37,290
One of us gets something big it's over.

4455
05:32:37,290 --> 05:32:38,970
Believe in your deck.

4456
05:32:38,970 --> 05:32:39,770
All right let's draw.

4457
05:32:42,430 --> 05:32:44,939
All right what do we get?

4458
05:32:46,840 --> 05:32:47,400
What?

4459
05:32:47,400 --> 05:32:57,439
Well I did I did did somebody say I can't can't he he fell for it.

4460
05:33:00,220 --> 05:33:01,259
Fucking hilarious.

4461
05:33:16,060 --> 05:33:19,869
Coin and you got a legendary too.

4462
05:33:20,590 --> 05:33:21,930
Where are my legendaries?

4463
05:33:26,520 --> 05:33:29,720
I can hold on top deck something crazy.

4464
05:33:29,720 --> 05:33:31,479
Come on come on come on.

4465
05:33:32,360 --> 05:33:32,919
Here we go.

4466
05:33:32,919 --> 05:33:34,279
Come on come on.

4467
05:33:34,279 --> 05:33:41,450
Let me just pull this out of my asshole right now.

4468
05:33:41,450 --> 05:33:44,250
So let me I'm gonna take this bear.

4469
05:33:44,250 --> 05:33:49,880
I need to get rid of justicar and then.

4470
05:33:49,880 --> 05:34:00,250
All right and then should I hit you too.

4471
05:34:00,970 --> 05:34:03,450
Should I just completely trade everything and then do it.

4472
05:34:03,450 --> 05:34:07,470
Bad play we're talking about.

4473
05:34:07,470 --> 05:34:08,349
Wait wait what's going on.

4474
05:34:08,909 --> 05:34:26,490
If I pull this out of my ass.

4475
05:34:26,490 --> 05:34:29,049
If I win with the silver hand recruits.

4476
05:34:29,770 --> 05:34:32,569
No there's no way you're gonna he's gonna get two armor every turn.

4477
05:34:33,209 --> 05:34:34,250
I'm gonna get fatigued.

4478
05:34:34,810 --> 05:34:45,740
He only needs two turns to win three turns to win.

4479
05:34:46,540 --> 05:34:47,709
He's gonna hit me twice.

4480
05:34:47,709 --> 05:34:48,189
I need to heal.

4481
05:34:48,189 --> 05:35:04,490
Do I have any heals?

4482
05:35:04,490 --> 05:35:06,650
All right come on a taunt.

4483
05:35:12,409 --> 05:35:13,209
I don't lose though.

4484
05:35:13,209 --> 05:35:15,930
Hold on because that's this is dead.

4485
05:35:15,930 --> 05:35:17,610
I have to trade everything.

4486
05:35:20,750 --> 05:35:21,470
Use the coin.

4487
05:35:21,470 --> 05:35:22,830
The coin doesn't do anything.

4488
05:35:23,470 --> 05:35:41,439
This is the most clown dog shit fucking game ever.

4489
05:35:41,439 --> 05:35:47,040
I need something I need something ridiculous.

4490
05:35:50,590 --> 05:35:53,319
I have one health.

4491
05:35:57,470 --> 05:35:59,310
All right come on something.

4492
05:36:06,669 --> 05:36:15,580
Would have been three and one.

4493
05:36:16,220 --> 05:36:18,459
No I really I'm gonna be two and fucking three.

4494
05:36:39,419 --> 05:36:41,580
Let the hunt begin.

4495
05:36:41,580 --> 05:36:43,419
I will fight with honor.

4496
05:36:47,819 --> 05:36:49,180
I'm so sad right now.

4497
05:36:49,819 --> 05:36:54,700
This is like watching a car crash in slow motion.

4498
05:36:54,700 --> 05:36:57,020
This is like watching a car crash in fast motion.

4499
05:37:04,970 --> 05:37:07,849
All right I'm gonna throw five and three.

4500
05:37:12,799 --> 05:37:13,759
Coin croc-a-lisk.

4501
05:37:14,880 --> 05:37:23,360
No wait it's 20 minutes per match not high motion.

4502
05:37:28,680 --> 05:37:31,000
It's all right it's okay.

4503
05:37:31,639 --> 05:37:32,040
Coin.

4504
05:37:33,500 --> 05:37:38,200
Uh what does that do?

4505
05:37:38,200 --> 05:37:39,560
Some of the three too big bad wolf.

4506
05:37:40,279 --> 05:37:42,750
Yeah get the taunt out here.

4507
05:37:54,139 --> 05:37:56,299
It's like watching a car crash that keeps happening.

4508
05:38:05,119 --> 05:38:09,310
Well I have divine shield now.

4509
05:38:09,310 --> 05:38:15,150
Divine shield get rid of this and then play the gloatron.

4510
05:38:33,450 --> 05:38:34,810
You know what this kind of feels like.

4511
05:38:35,450 --> 05:38:44,159
So I went to a I went to a cake competition and I brought with me um boxed little Debbie cake.

4512
05:38:45,119 --> 05:38:46,319
By the way I've never made a cake before.

4513
05:38:47,610 --> 05:38:51,049
At this cake competition there are like 500 other people here

4514
05:38:51,049 --> 05:38:57,290
that have been making cakes for 10 years and while I'm making my cake

4515
05:38:58,490 --> 05:39:01,900
just over there I don't plan on winning.

4516
05:39:01,900 --> 05:39:04,540
Everybody else making their cakes are like shouting out

4517
05:39:05,529 --> 05:39:13,439
hey your cake sucks your cake is gross my cake is delicious.

4518
05:39:17,759 --> 05:39:23,290
All right what do I want to do here?

4519
05:39:23,290 --> 05:39:26,409
Uh this is my responsibility.

4520
05:39:29,659 --> 05:39:30,619
What do you got in here?

4521
05:39:31,180 --> 05:39:42,919
He's gets it's definitely explosive trap.

4522
05:39:45,150 --> 05:39:50,330
Oh I called it called it I called it.

4523
05:39:51,049 --> 05:39:58,159
You have 400 hours I have 400 hours I had like lying.

4524
05:39:58,159 --> 05:40:00,799
I had like 200 hours in this game in 2013.

4525
05:40:01,360 --> 05:40:06,909
The cars that I played with don't even exist anymore.

4526
05:40:06,909 --> 05:40:08,279
I remember this one.

4527
05:40:09,000 --> 05:40:13,439
Do you remember that one?

4528
05:40:15,000 --> 05:40:17,479
All right we got another trade here that I don't really want to make.

4529
05:40:22,200 --> 05:40:24,360
200 hours of making terrible cakes.

4530
05:40:26,189 --> 05:40:28,909
All right I get a focus here.

4531
05:40:28,909 --> 05:40:34,669
I'm going lights you got it in my head already.

4532
05:40:55,119 --> 05:40:56,400
Lights camera cake.

4533
05:41:09,720 --> 05:41:12,479
Can I say I can silence that right?

4534
05:41:12,479 --> 05:41:14,479
Is that that is that kind of a spell or a hero power?

4535
05:41:19,040 --> 05:41:20,400
Is that a spell or a hero power?

4536
05:41:26,919 --> 05:41:28,040
Sorry got you.

4537
05:41:43,229 --> 05:41:55,209
My cake's not good but you haven't even eaten it yet.

4538
05:41:55,209 --> 05:42:07,360
It was just deal three damage to all minions.

4539
05:42:09,849 --> 05:42:11,130
Well this is not going to be good.

4540
05:42:11,849 --> 05:42:14,810
He's going to clear everything.

4541
05:42:15,369 --> 05:42:18,560
I mean I just have to do this right?

4542
05:42:20,860 --> 05:42:22,560
If only I had the silence.

4543
05:42:22,560 --> 05:42:31,680
Yeah get that coffee pasta shit out of here.

4544
05:42:33,049 --> 05:42:35,770
Get that coffee pasta shit the fuck out of here.

4545
05:42:44,560 --> 05:42:46,159
I don't want to see that shit.

4546
05:42:55,319 --> 05:42:55,799
Justice.

4547
05:43:11,049 --> 05:43:13,930
The single most predictable result in the chat room.

4548
05:43:13,930 --> 05:43:24,750
I know I know.

4549
05:43:24,750 --> 05:43:29,849
I get it put it in cake only mode emote only.

4550
05:43:29,849 --> 05:43:32,159
I don't want us to get emote only.

4551
05:43:32,159 --> 05:43:34,720
I don't want to they don't deserve my cake.

4552
05:43:44,889 --> 05:43:48,110
Somebody got to fuck you in right before it happened.

4553
05:43:56,009 --> 05:43:57,369
You don't deserve my cake.

4554
05:43:58,090 --> 05:44:02,680
What's what's going on?

4555
05:44:03,240 --> 05:44:05,259
He just released a house?

4556
05:44:05,979 --> 05:44:11,400
Well that's all right because I got bang bang.

4557
05:44:18,639 --> 05:44:28,169
It's kind of on the ropes.

4558
05:44:28,169 --> 05:44:29,130
Just don't kill me.

4559
05:44:29,849 --> 05:44:32,169
Let me go three and two.

4560
05:44:32,889 --> 05:44:34,669
That's a pretty good KD in a server.

4561
05:44:35,389 --> 05:44:44,009
That's above 500.

4562
05:44:47,049 --> 05:44:49,849
All right three four five six seven.

4563
05:44:49,849 --> 05:44:51,880
Any of these mech?

4564
05:44:55,159 --> 05:44:59,450
I'm dumping everybody four five six seven eight nine.

4565
05:45:00,090 --> 05:45:03,880
I gotta go for it.

4566
05:45:04,439 --> 05:45:08,799
I want a legendary.

4567
05:45:09,360 --> 05:45:10,409
You know what just do it.

4568
05:45:18,090 --> 05:45:18,970
Justice.

4569
05:45:18,970 --> 05:45:36,729
I have lethal right now.

4570
05:45:36,729 --> 05:45:40,830
He has to kill something and I've got doctor blast.

4571
05:45:41,389 --> 05:45:46,700
He has to get rid of everything.

4572
05:45:49,040 --> 05:45:50,080
That's a fucking mech.

4573
05:45:50,080 --> 05:45:50,880
Did I just lose?

4574
05:45:51,599 --> 05:45:52,720
No I didn't just lose.

4575
05:45:52,720 --> 05:45:53,919
I can't fucking believe it.

4576
05:45:55,849 --> 05:45:56,810
Oh my god.

4577
05:45:56,810 --> 05:45:57,849
I can't fucking believe it.

4578
05:46:01,400 --> 05:46:02,520
That's great synergy.

4579
05:46:02,520 --> 05:46:05,799
I don't have a single fucking synergy card in the entire deck.

4580
05:46:06,599 --> 05:46:07,799
In the whole deck.

4581
05:46:19,580 --> 05:46:21,259
I don't whatever it's over.

4582
05:46:31,740 --> 05:46:32,220
No I won.

4583
05:46:33,500 --> 05:46:34,619
I just won the game.

4584
05:46:34,619 --> 05:46:38,110
I just won the game with one health.

4585
05:46:43,340 --> 05:46:44,700
Wait wait wait just make sure I have it.

4586
05:46:51,080 --> 05:46:51,959
There you go guys.

4587
05:46:51,959 --> 05:46:54,279
Oh yeah okay he's not even very good at the video game.

4588
05:46:54,279 --> 05:46:55,799
He's not even I don't think he's very good at this.

4589
05:46:56,520 --> 05:47:00,330
All right take it off emote only they're behaving.

4590
05:47:19,919 --> 05:47:20,799
You guys.

4591
05:47:20,799 --> 05:47:22,560
Would you like some of my cake?

4592
05:47:22,560 --> 05:47:28,459
I made it special for you.

4593
05:47:28,459 --> 05:47:29,740
I made it special for you guys.

4594
05:47:30,540 --> 05:47:46,779
My stream was crashing because of the emotes.

4595
05:47:48,029 --> 05:47:49,310
See I'm saving you.

4596
05:47:49,310 --> 05:47:52,970
I'm okay with three and three that's even.

4597
05:47:52,970 --> 05:47:54,090
No that's not hello.

4598
05:47:54,970 --> 05:47:56,330
I tried to say where's hello.

4599
05:47:59,389 --> 05:48:01,389
That's like ultimate ultra BM.

4600
05:48:01,389 --> 05:48:19,580
Like I but I did not turn one coin.

4601
05:48:19,580 --> 05:48:25,400
That's right not gonna really okay.

4602
05:48:31,610 --> 05:48:32,409
I can do that too.

4603
05:48:33,130 --> 05:48:41,560
Am I gonna get absolutely fucked if I start playing this game without spending money?

4604
05:48:44,349 --> 05:48:48,509
No they give you they give you packs.

4605
05:48:48,509 --> 05:48:59,979
They do you get like five to ten packs.

4606
05:49:02,090 --> 05:49:03,130
I mean you could do a Reno.

4607
05:49:10,139 --> 05:49:12,139
Actually rank 50 is pretty fair.

4608
05:49:17,479 --> 05:49:18,919
Let's keep the control up here.

4609
05:49:21,209 --> 05:49:23,209
I wonder do you think he's got like a polymorph?

4610
05:49:23,209 --> 05:49:24,810
Should I get this out there right now?

4611
05:49:24,810 --> 05:49:27,209
Or should I throw out the herald and face?

4612
05:49:27,849 --> 05:49:35,580
I'm gonna herald and face or spell word and haste.

4613
05:49:37,020 --> 05:49:42,279
Go back to Mario Yahtzee.

4614
05:49:42,279 --> 05:49:45,479
I already dominated that game to a point where I don't even care anymore.

4615
05:49:45,959 --> 05:49:55,360
I'm gonna bring in a gurubashi berserker.

4616
05:49:58,319 --> 05:50:03,930
Now this is a scenario where I'm gonna potentially equality this.

4617
05:50:04,569 --> 05:50:05,849
No I could.

4618
05:50:06,490 --> 05:50:07,799
It wouldn't be that bad.

4619
05:50:08,520 --> 05:50:11,209
I'm not sure that would be the worst thing.

4620
05:50:13,389 --> 05:50:14,909
Or to get the tuskar out here.

4621
05:50:33,240 --> 05:50:45,470
Okay next turn with murloc and hero power.

4622
05:50:58,459 --> 05:51:01,680
Next spell we got oh that's not good playing cannon.

4623
05:51:01,680 --> 05:51:01,919
Fuck.

4624
05:51:07,610 --> 05:51:23,069
No okay I could do sword and I could do sword and equality and kill this.

4625
05:51:24,799 --> 05:51:25,840
That keeps me alive.

4626
05:51:31,389 --> 05:51:38,040
Or sword and oh fuck equality's four mana.

4627
05:51:41,240 --> 05:51:42,439
Shit I don't know what to do.

4628
05:51:43,080 --> 05:51:48,220
I think I'm just gonna have to do murloc and hit hero power.

4629
05:51:56,360 --> 05:51:57,880
I'm itching my head again.

4630
05:52:05,500 --> 05:52:11,840
It is sending just stuff to die but I need to put I have to have something here.

4631
05:52:11,840 --> 05:52:13,599
Otherwise he's just gonna start to destroy me.

4632
05:52:14,159 --> 05:52:18,700
And it is a terrible murloc but at least it's not terrible.

4633
05:52:18,700 --> 05:52:19,580
Still plenty of cards.

4634
05:52:28,430 --> 05:52:30,509
Interesting.

4635
05:52:31,610 --> 05:52:33,770
He wants to keep this alive so he can do that.

4636
05:52:35,560 --> 05:52:35,799
Okay.

4637
05:52:42,909 --> 05:52:43,549
All right.

4638
05:52:57,790 --> 05:53:00,349
Ogre and gloatron I think is the only thing I can do.

4639
05:53:07,259 --> 05:53:09,229
You have to get rid of it.

4640
05:53:12,509 --> 05:53:14,590
I'm happy I'm here for Jeremy to teach the game.

4641
05:53:14,590 --> 05:53:16,430
Yeah I've got some strategies here.

4642
05:53:17,150 --> 05:53:19,520
He lost every game.

4643
05:53:19,520 --> 05:53:20,159
That's a lie.

4644
05:53:20,159 --> 05:53:21,040
Don't listen to that.

4645
05:53:21,040 --> 05:53:22,400
I'm three and two right now.

4646
05:53:23,360 --> 05:53:26,240
At least be truthful about it.

4647
05:53:27,200 --> 05:53:34,720
He thought about it.

4648
05:53:34,720 --> 05:53:35,439
He's not trading.

4649
05:53:36,319 --> 05:53:38,330
Huh.

4650
05:53:41,639 --> 05:53:47,950
So just get some minions on the board and fucking what does this do?

4651
05:53:47,950 --> 05:53:52,029
Whenever you cast dispel summon random three cost beast that's not good.

4652
05:53:52,029 --> 05:54:00,090
I think it is time for equality.

4653
05:54:04,319 --> 05:54:05,759
It's time for equality.

4654
05:54:17,080 --> 05:54:17,799
Trade first.

4655
05:54:19,549 --> 05:54:21,389
I mean doesn't it does not matter.

4656
05:54:24,569 --> 05:54:24,970
I guess.

4657
05:54:31,869 --> 05:54:36,990
Not that one.

4658
05:54:38,459 --> 05:54:39,180
Wrong trade.

4659
05:54:47,259 --> 05:54:50,459
You guys saying the robot and I thought it was the rope.

4660
05:54:51,419 --> 05:54:51,900
Whatever.

4661
05:54:52,459 --> 05:54:57,450
I'm gonna stick to peeing my pants on stream.

4662
05:54:57,450 --> 05:54:58,330
That's probably easier.

4663
05:55:02,619 --> 05:55:03,099
That's it.

4664
05:55:03,099 --> 05:55:03,500
I lose.

4665
05:55:04,220 --> 05:55:26,750
Should have drawn I wish I drew consecration in six games.

4666
05:55:26,750 --> 05:55:27,389
That would be fun.

4667
05:55:44,439 --> 05:55:45,400
All right.

4668
05:55:45,400 --> 05:55:45,959
That's it.

4669
05:55:57,000 --> 05:55:58,119
No no more arena.

4670
05:55:58,119 --> 05:56:02,680
Arena just like I was like happy and chipper when we were playing

4671
05:56:03,319 --> 05:56:08,759
in the solo adventure and then I go to arena and I play against players that have cards

4672
05:56:08,759 --> 05:56:19,200
and it becomes a disaster.

4673
05:56:19,200 --> 05:56:22,299
No actually I had a lot of fun.

4674
05:56:22,299 --> 05:56:26,619
I'm so happy that I streamed this game for one reason for the comedic purpose

4675
05:56:27,259 --> 05:56:31,819
of being the number one Hearthstone streamer on Twitch for like 45 minutes

4676
05:56:32,380 --> 05:56:36,599
or like a couple hours or something and having ranked 25 next to my name.

4677
05:56:36,599 --> 05:56:38,200
That was just worth it completely.

4678
05:56:40,509 --> 05:56:41,229
It just was.

4679
05:56:54,299 --> 05:56:59,639
I was in the number one spot for like what 20 minutes or 30 minutes or something

4680
05:57:02,009 --> 05:57:03,759
but that's gonna be it.

4681
05:57:03,759 --> 05:57:07,040
That brings us right to like a nice perfect clean six hours.

4682
05:57:18,009 --> 05:57:19,849
It's fun to do this every once in a while.

4683
05:57:19,849 --> 05:57:23,599
Play like the game that a lot of people play.

4684
05:57:26,840 --> 05:57:31,240
Even if I wasn't playing that well and it was just kind of all over the place.

4685
05:57:31,240 --> 05:57:32,119
I still had a lot of fun.

4686
05:57:32,119 --> 05:57:32,919
It was fucking great.

4687
05:57:37,479 --> 05:57:40,439
So tomorrow we are never going to see this again.

4688
05:57:41,319 --> 05:57:41,880
I'm gonna get...

4689
05:57:42,599 --> 05:57:43,560
Good night everybody.

4690
05:57:43,560 --> 05:57:44,279
See you next time.

4691
05:57:44,279 --> 05:57:45,000
See you tomorrow.

4692
05:57:45,000 --> 05:57:46,840
I'm gonna play Cooking Simulator tomorrow.

4693
05:57:46,840 --> 05:57:47,639
Have a great day.

4694
05:57:47,639 --> 05:57:48,840
Have a great night guys.

4695
05:57:48,840 --> 05:57:51,159
This dream is gonna turn up and I'm just gonna scream into my hands.

4696
05:57:55,040 --> 05:57:55,279
No.

4697
05:57:57,180 --> 05:57:58,700
Tomorrow we're gonna come back.

4698
05:57:58,700 --> 05:58:01,419
I was supposed to play Cooking Simulator today but it wasn't out.

4699
05:58:02,220 --> 05:58:10,360
So tomorrow is gonna be even more probably of a shitshow

4700
05:58:10,360 --> 05:58:12,279
but the game actually releases tomorrow.

4701
05:58:12,279 --> 05:58:13,959
It's the only reason why I'm not playing it today.

4702
05:58:13,959 --> 05:58:18,349
Do you have any plans to play...

4703
05:58:19,310 --> 05:58:21,790
Okay, I'm gonna give you my actual classic wild plan.

4704
05:58:23,290 --> 05:58:26,220
I probably am just gonna play it off stream.

4705
05:58:26,220 --> 05:58:29,099
And on stream maybe sometimes when we do something fun.

4706
05:58:30,169 --> 05:58:34,090
Maybe we'll try to like raid Ogramar or something with like 50 people.

4707
05:58:34,729 --> 05:58:37,930
Just try to take over the capital or something for like certain streams.

4708
05:58:37,930 --> 05:58:38,729
Might be fun to do.

4709
05:58:43,049 --> 05:58:47,610
But off stream I plan on just kind of casually playing it.

4710
05:58:47,610 --> 05:58:48,569
I'll probably make a guild.

4711
05:58:49,689 --> 05:58:52,169
I'll let everybody know the server I'm on if you guys want to play it.

4712
05:58:52,650 --> 05:58:55,529
Just have like a group of people that just play it off and on.

4713
05:58:55,529 --> 05:59:04,590
Should be fun.

4714
05:59:05,229 --> 05:59:06,029
Looking forward to it.

4715
05:59:07,930 --> 05:59:12,009
Try to actually take down like Onyxio or something on stream with chat.

4716
05:59:14,159 --> 05:59:20,380
Whatever the guild is try to do it without any voice over IP and like no communication.

4717
05:59:20,380 --> 05:59:22,090
It would be fucking hilarious.

4718
05:59:28,220 --> 05:59:30,060
But I'll see you tomorrow if you take it up.

4719
05:59:30,060 --> 05:59:32,540
I'm gonna go just take a quick pee break.

4720
05:59:32,540 --> 05:59:33,180
I'll be right back.

4721
05:59:34,250 --> 05:59:36,729
And we'll do the bits and the subs and everything.

4722
05:59:36,729 --> 05:59:37,849
There was a shitload of subs.

4723
05:59:37,849 --> 05:59:39,209
There was a ton of fucking money.

4724
05:59:39,209 --> 05:59:42,169
I know it was like a little like sub train and stuff in the beginning.

4725
05:59:42,169 --> 05:59:43,869
And we were making jokes about it.

4726
05:59:43,869 --> 05:59:48,540
But that was a lot of subs and a lot of fucking money in the beginning of the stream.

4727
05:59:48,540 --> 05:59:49,259
Hope you enjoyed it.

4728
05:59:49,259 --> 05:59:50,619
As always, I had a blast.

4729
05:59:50,619 --> 05:59:53,720
At least I got to three wins.

4730
05:59:53,720 --> 05:59:55,880
Thank you for watching.

4731
05:59:55,880 --> 06:00:00,299
I'll see you tomorrow for Cooking Simulator.

4732
06:00:00,299 --> 06:00:02,590
Don't miss it.

4733
06:00:02,590 --> 06:00:03,869
I will be right back.

4734
06:00:03,869 --> 06:02:51,900
See you soon.

4735
06:02:51,900 --> 06:02:52,700
All right.

4736
06:02:52,700 --> 06:02:57,150
Hey, what is this mic peak?

4737
06:03:00,880 --> 06:03:01,279
Save it.

4738
06:03:02,319 --> 06:03:03,759
I've been a manual save in a while.

4739
06:03:07,369 --> 06:03:08,569
That kind of wasn't mic peak.

4740
06:03:08,569 --> 06:03:08,970
You're right.

4741
06:03:10,889 --> 06:03:11,689
Angry chat.

4742
06:03:13,599 --> 06:03:14,319
What are these clips?

4743
06:03:14,959 --> 06:03:18,459
You are going to get frustrated on this stream.

4744
06:03:19,180 --> 06:03:20,619
You're going to be mad at me.

4745
06:03:20,619 --> 06:03:21,979
You're going to yell at me.

4746
06:03:21,979 --> 06:03:23,340
You're going to call me names.

4747
06:03:24,779 --> 06:03:25,419
Anything else?

4748
06:03:25,419 --> 06:03:28,220
And I'm going to puff my chest out and be like, yeah, right.

4749
06:03:29,180 --> 06:03:30,700
I kind of did that a few times.

4750
06:03:39,720 --> 06:03:39,959
All right.

4751
06:03:39,959 --> 06:03:40,759
Let me get off like that.

4752
06:03:50,540 --> 06:03:53,580
Let's get the correct screen on.

4753
06:03:53,580 --> 06:03:54,220
Why not, right?

4754
06:03:59,080 --> 06:04:01,560
Let's go over the bits from earlier.

4755
06:04:03,419 --> 06:04:04,939
We had so many...

4756
06:04:04,939 --> 06:04:06,619
Just wait till you see the subs fly by.

4757
06:04:07,419 --> 06:04:08,880
They are going to...

4758
06:04:09,439 --> 06:04:10,319
Oh, my God.

4759
06:04:11,840 --> 06:04:12,959
This is ridiculous.

4760
06:04:15,180 --> 06:04:18,459
I'm scrolling fucking forever.

4761
06:04:18,459 --> 06:04:21,020
How many subs there were today for community sub?

4762
06:04:24,169 --> 06:04:24,490
Wow.

4763
06:04:30,750 --> 06:04:31,229
Yeah.

4764
06:04:31,229 --> 06:04:33,150
When you see the credits, just wait till you see these fly by.

4765
06:04:33,790 --> 06:04:37,020
Anyways, let's start back here.

4766
06:04:37,020 --> 06:04:38,939
About six plus.

4767
06:04:38,939 --> 06:04:40,700
A little six over six hours ago or so.

4768
06:04:42,060 --> 06:04:45,340
We had a cut tag for the $8.

4769
06:04:45,340 --> 06:04:46,619
Thank you for eight bucks.

4770
06:04:47,720 --> 06:04:48,439
Whoa, dude.

4771
06:04:48,439 --> 06:04:49,080
Nice card.

4772
06:04:49,080 --> 06:04:51,560
I got like three legendaries and 20 packs.

4773
06:04:51,560 --> 06:04:52,919
That's actually really fucking good.

4774
06:04:52,919 --> 06:04:53,720
That's really good.

4775
06:04:54,840 --> 06:05:01,930
But thank you.

4776
06:05:01,930 --> 06:05:02,409
Cut tag.

4777
06:05:03,049 --> 06:05:03,689
Oh, gee.

4778
06:05:03,689 --> 06:05:04,169
Jeff Durr.

4779
06:05:04,169 --> 06:05:04,889
Thanks for the $10.

4780
06:05:06,650 --> 06:05:08,650
Says he doesn't want to get hyped and energetic,

4781
06:05:08,650 --> 06:05:10,889
but then today he is screaming in the first 30 minutes.

4782
06:05:14,240 --> 06:05:16,799
Yeah, but like my brain is hyped up, but my body isn't.

4783
06:05:16,799 --> 06:05:17,599
I get to just kind of...

4784
06:05:20,200 --> 06:05:20,520
Whatever.

4785
06:05:20,520 --> 06:05:21,159
The other way around.

4786
06:05:26,139 --> 06:05:26,779
It's comfy.

4787
06:05:29,709 --> 06:05:31,709
I'm comfortable, you know?

4788
06:05:32,750 --> 06:05:33,950
Even if I yell a little bit,

4789
06:05:33,950 --> 06:05:35,950
I use my nasal patches just for the air to come out,

4790
06:05:35,950 --> 06:05:36,990
not my stomach, so I'm fine.

4791
06:05:37,549 --> 06:05:43,360
Hopefully he did well in Hearthstone.

4792
06:05:43,360 --> 06:05:44,080
Nobody tell him.

4793
06:05:45,529 --> 06:05:46,569
Nobody tell him.

4794
06:05:46,569 --> 06:05:52,299
But thank you, OG Jeff Durr for the 10 bucks.

4795
06:05:53,020 --> 06:05:55,200
Really appreciate it.

4796
06:05:57,950 --> 06:06:01,680
And then I think I missed this earlier.

4797
06:06:01,680 --> 06:06:03,840
Some guy gave another $50 earlier.

4798
06:06:04,400 --> 06:06:06,240
It's a Doom OST or Riot.

4799
06:06:06,799 --> 06:06:08,880
Thank you for the huge amount of money.

4800
06:06:08,880 --> 06:06:10,720
It was $150, I think, today.

4801
06:06:10,720 --> 06:06:12,799
Yeah, just look at the fucking board.

4802
06:06:15,020 --> 06:06:15,740
My god.

4803
06:06:18,909 --> 06:06:22,349
There was hundreds of dollars just running in at the same time.

4804
06:06:24,169 --> 06:06:25,529
I'm sorry I missed something if I did.

4805
06:06:26,490 --> 06:06:27,450
But thank you nonetheless.

4806
06:06:30,360 --> 06:06:31,639
So many community subs.

4807
06:06:32,680 --> 06:06:35,000
Thank you dot me.

4808
06:06:35,000 --> 06:06:36,200
Dot is me.

4809
06:06:36,200 --> 06:06:38,279
Dot see me for the $5.

4810
06:06:39,560 --> 06:06:41,000
And they just say hype.

4811
06:06:43,000 --> 06:06:43,319
Hype.

4812
06:06:44,060 --> 06:06:44,779
Yes.

4813
06:06:44,779 --> 06:06:45,500
Yes, yes, yes.

4814
06:06:46,060 --> 06:06:49,639
They also say pride 100.

4815
06:06:49,639 --> 06:06:55,610
Thank you for the $5.

4816
06:06:55,610 --> 06:06:57,290
Thank you hack it fast for $10.

4817
06:06:58,569 --> 06:06:59,689
Hack it fast.

4818
06:06:59,689 --> 06:07:01,049
Recommend me a good whiskey.

4819
06:07:01,049 --> 06:07:02,250
Also, I eat ass.

4820
06:07:03,680 --> 06:07:04,880
Oh, I got that earlier.

4821
06:07:04,880 --> 06:07:05,520
Yeah.

4822
06:07:05,520 --> 06:07:07,840
If you want to spend a lot of money, Johnny Walker Blue.

4823
06:07:07,840 --> 06:07:11,439
If you want to spend a little bit about like $30, $40 a bottle,

4824
06:07:11,439 --> 06:07:13,439
Johnny Walker Black, Johnny Walker Red.

4825
06:07:13,439 --> 06:07:16,319
Johnny Walker is just good if you like whiskey.

4826
06:07:17,360 --> 06:07:19,080
Mike said about E3.

4827
06:07:19,080 --> 06:07:20,200
I'm going to come covering E3.

4828
06:07:20,200 --> 06:07:22,439
We're getting a full on professional coverage from me.

4829
06:07:24,669 --> 06:07:25,869
Don't suggest red.

4830
06:07:27,950 --> 06:07:28,669
No, it depends.

4831
06:07:28,669 --> 06:07:29,790
You know, some people just want to,

4832
06:07:30,509 --> 06:07:34,750
you want to spend like, you know, 25, 30 bucks on a bottle of alcohol.

4833
06:07:38,619 --> 06:07:41,500
Johnny Walker is like saying to drink Budweiser if you like lagers.

4834
06:07:41,500 --> 06:07:41,740
What?

4835
06:07:43,229 --> 06:07:45,229
Johnny Walker Blue is really good.

4836
06:07:52,840 --> 06:07:55,639
Johnny Walker Blue is a very, very high quality alcohol.

4837
06:08:03,099 --> 06:08:05,020
I mean, it's not like Jack Daniels.

4838
06:08:05,740 --> 06:08:07,580
The dude that does two different kinds of,

4839
06:08:07,580 --> 06:08:08,779
those two different things, but.

4840
06:08:14,750 --> 06:08:17,229
Jack Daniels is the Budweiser of whiskey.

4841
06:08:17,950 --> 06:08:19,310
I'm going to have to disagree with you on that.

4842
06:08:22,409 --> 06:08:23,369
It's all the same shit.

4843
06:08:23,369 --> 06:08:26,009
Just go get a jug of vodka for five bucks.

4844
06:08:28,090 --> 06:08:38,700
You could, but thank you.

4845
06:08:38,700 --> 06:08:39,900
Hack it fast.

4846
06:08:39,900 --> 06:08:48,619
Also, Glen Fetich is another great one if you like whiskey.

4847
06:08:53,130 --> 06:08:54,569
Whiskey tastes like a house fire.

4848
06:09:05,979 --> 06:09:08,459
Hey, quats or cats.

4849
06:09:08,459 --> 06:09:09,740
Thanks for $5.

4850
06:09:10,540 --> 06:09:10,860
Sorry.

4851
06:09:10,860 --> 06:09:14,540
I'm just a, just a common $500 bit donation in that pack.

4852
06:09:15,259 --> 06:09:22,720
If you were here in the beginning of the stream,

4853
06:09:22,720 --> 06:09:25,919
when I was opening the packs, $50 would come out.

4854
06:09:26,560 --> 06:09:30,040
I would open a card pack and like 20 community subs would show up.

4855
06:09:31,290 --> 06:09:34,250
Sorry, just a common 500 bit donation in that one.

4856
06:09:36,639 --> 06:09:38,560
$5 is still a lot of money to give anybody.

4857
06:09:39,119 --> 06:09:40,479
Thank you for $5.

4858
06:09:41,119 --> 06:09:44,439
I'm honored to accept it.

4859
06:09:44,439 --> 06:09:48,919
Oh, I hear a little barking auto.

4860
06:09:51,099 --> 06:09:53,099
Thank you also to cats again for $5.

4861
06:09:53,099 --> 06:09:54,619
They say pride 500 and then.

4862
06:09:55,500 --> 06:10:02,029
Uh, beater, beater, auto.

4863
06:10:02,029 --> 06:10:02,750
What are you barking at?

4864
06:10:02,750 --> 06:10:07,319
He never barks like this.

4865
06:10:12,430 --> 06:10:13,069
Listen to him.

4866
06:10:13,069 --> 06:10:13,470
He doesn't.

4867
06:10:13,470 --> 06:10:14,909
I've never heard him bark like that.

4868
06:10:15,630 --> 06:10:16,840
Hold on.

4869
06:10:16,840 --> 06:10:17,400
Can you hear that?

4870
06:10:18,040 --> 06:10:20,169
He never barks.

4871
06:10:22,729 --> 06:10:23,049
Hold on.

4872
06:10:23,049 --> 06:10:23,450
Let me go.

4873
06:10:24,409 --> 06:10:25,209
Hold on.

4874
06:10:25,209 --> 06:10:25,770
Let me go see.

4875
06:10:25,770 --> 06:10:26,569
Let me go investigate it.

4876
06:10:26,569 --> 06:10:26,970
We're back.

4877
06:10:27,610 --> 06:11:07,580
Yeah, it's just, it was an intruder.

4878
06:11:07,580 --> 06:11:09,500
I just like, I fucking punched him all the way.

4879
06:11:09,500 --> 06:11:11,819
He flew all the way to the police station and they put him in handcuffs.

4880
06:11:19,369 --> 06:11:20,490
That was Kim.

4881
06:11:20,490 --> 06:11:24,040
She was just, uh, she was outside.

4882
06:11:24,279 --> 06:11:25,159
Now she's back inside.

4883
06:11:25,720 --> 06:11:33,150
I got my Hearthstone sponsor check.

4884
06:11:33,150 --> 06:11:36,009
I, no, I did not.

4885
06:11:38,830 --> 06:11:40,270
No, I did not.

4886
06:11:40,909 --> 06:11:42,110
No, no, no, no.

4887
06:11:42,110 --> 06:11:42,909
All right.

4888
06:11:42,909 --> 06:11:44,110
Thank you for the bits.

4889
06:11:44,110 --> 06:11:44,669
Here we go.

4890
06:11:47,709 --> 06:11:50,189
Uh, we got $19.50.

4891
06:11:50,189 --> 06:11:52,270
50, it was $50 so many times.

4892
06:11:52,270 --> 06:11:53,630
You guys are fucking so generous.

4893
06:11:53,630 --> 06:11:54,029
Thank you.

4894
06:11:56,189 --> 06:11:57,470
Jamie, 2803.

4895
06:11:57,470 --> 06:11:58,430
Thanks for the $10.

4896
06:11:58,430 --> 06:11:59,709
They say, Jerome Hart.

4897
06:12:00,270 --> 06:12:01,599
Thank you for the 10 bucks.

4898
06:12:07,240 --> 06:12:08,520
There's a little room right there.

4899
06:12:09,840 --> 06:12:11,200
A flair pancake.

4900
06:12:11,200 --> 06:12:12,400
Thanks for the $2.75.

4901
06:12:13,279 --> 06:12:16,279
Hey, Jerome, I'm back from my trip to the Philippines.

4902
06:12:16,279 --> 06:12:21,159
I had a great time, but the whole time I was worried that without my constant attention,

4903
06:12:21,159 --> 06:12:23,080
you'd turn into some normie streamer.

4904
06:12:23,880 --> 06:12:25,799
Sorry, Jerome, I won't let this happen again.

4905
06:12:26,599 --> 06:12:38,799
It didn't happen.

4906
06:12:38,799 --> 06:12:39,520
It was you.

4907
06:12:40,319 --> 06:12:42,279
It didn't happen.

4908
06:12:42,919 --> 06:12:43,720
It didn't come true.

4909
06:12:47,630 --> 06:12:48,029
Whatever.

4910
06:12:48,029 --> 06:12:49,790
I played Hearthstone on one stream.

4911
06:12:50,590 --> 06:12:53,439
Oh, what's the big deal?

4912
06:12:53,439 --> 06:12:58,959
I played Hearthstone for like fucking five and a half hours, one time.

4913
06:12:59,599 --> 06:13:00,970
I just wanted to do it.

4914
06:13:00,970 --> 06:13:03,770
We just fucking throwing the feelers out, guys.

4915
06:13:04,490 --> 06:13:07,099
I had a good time.

4916
06:13:07,740 --> 06:13:19,150
No, you did.

4917
06:13:19,150 --> 06:13:19,630
Yes, I did.

4918
06:13:23,900 --> 06:13:24,860
I thought it was fun.

4919
06:13:28,509 --> 06:13:29,549
I had a lot of fun too.

4920
06:13:31,279 --> 06:13:33,279
This is definitely not the worst stream.

4921
06:13:33,279 --> 06:13:33,759
Yeah, what?

4922
06:13:33,759 --> 06:13:36,560
You're going to put this in the 2019 worst stream category?

4923
06:13:37,279 --> 06:13:40,299
No, I call bullshit on that one.

4924
06:13:50,520 --> 06:13:54,750
Worse than days gone?

4925
06:13:54,750 --> 06:13:56,669
I'm sorry, but that is not correct.

4926
06:13:57,229 --> 06:14:03,419
Days gone was fun too.

4927
06:14:03,419 --> 06:14:07,259
There hasn't even been a candidate for 2019 worst stream.

4928
06:14:07,259 --> 06:14:10,299
I'm on a roll this year.

4929
06:14:10,299 --> 06:14:11,099
What was that?

4930
06:14:11,099 --> 06:14:12,380
There really hasn't been.

4931
06:14:12,380 --> 06:14:16,380
Has there been like a worst of 2019 stream?

4932
06:14:22,159 --> 06:14:24,479
We are going into the middle of June.

4933
06:14:25,119 --> 06:14:30,490
I did.

4934
06:14:30,490 --> 06:14:32,250
I played Mario Tennis last year.

4935
06:14:32,250 --> 06:14:46,599
I'm on a roll this year.

4936
06:14:47,680 --> 06:14:51,439
I could give you at least two or three by the time we got to March last year.

4937
06:14:52,159 --> 06:14:56,729
Must be that fucking fresh Vegas air.

4938
06:14:57,549 --> 06:15:00,509
Vegas air quality is like some of the worst in the country.

4939
06:15:00,509 --> 06:15:06,970
I think it's up there somewhere.

4940
06:15:08,799 --> 06:15:09,759
Air is overrated.

4941
06:15:10,400 --> 06:15:12,939
But anyways, I have a lot of fun.

4942
06:15:12,939 --> 06:15:13,259
I did.

4943
06:15:13,979 --> 06:15:15,319
I really did.

4944
06:15:15,319 --> 06:15:17,720
You can tell that I'm not having fun because I'm not like engaging

4945
06:15:17,720 --> 06:15:18,840
and I'm just sitting there like whatever.

4946
06:15:19,799 --> 06:15:24,959
Okay, so yeah, I think I'm going to move on.

4947
06:15:24,959 --> 06:15:25,840
I'm going to do something else.

4948
06:15:27,369 --> 06:15:30,560
Great fucking time with all of you.

4949
06:15:30,560 --> 06:15:30,880
Okay.

4950
06:15:43,479 --> 06:15:45,240
There was a moment where you screamed at chat.

4951
06:15:45,240 --> 06:15:46,360
Are you excited?

4952
06:15:48,639 --> 06:15:50,240
Yeah, like I was excited.

4953
06:15:50,240 --> 06:15:52,720
I was just checking to see if you were also excited too.

4954
06:15:52,720 --> 06:15:54,240
And at least 40 people wrote it.

4955
06:16:01,790 --> 06:16:04,509
But anyways, let's get closer to the end here.

4956
06:16:06,810 --> 06:16:08,409
But welcome back.

4957
06:16:08,409 --> 06:16:10,169
That was FlarePancake for $2.75.

4958
06:16:10,970 --> 06:16:13,840
Hope you had fun on your trip to the Philippines.

4959
06:16:14,479 --> 06:16:17,500
And we also had Tingy.

4960
06:16:17,500 --> 06:16:18,779
$2.50 from Tingy.

4961
06:16:18,779 --> 06:16:21,099
I'm sorry this is a little too low effort.

4962
06:16:21,099 --> 06:16:22,939
I did only a couple minutes to make it.

4963
06:16:22,939 --> 06:16:24,459
This is your chat in a nutshell.

4964
06:16:25,900 --> 06:16:26,700
Chat in a nutshell.

4965
06:16:26,700 --> 06:16:27,020
Let's see.

4966
06:16:28,830 --> 06:16:31,069
Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown?

4967
06:16:31,229 --> 06:16:32,509
You don't understand.

4968
06:16:32,509 --> 06:16:35,549
My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority.

4969
06:16:35,549 --> 06:16:39,869
And between you and me, my hair is thinning a bit.

4970
06:16:39,869 --> 06:16:40,909
Oh, your highness.

4971
06:16:40,909 --> 06:16:42,349
I'm sure it's not that noticeable.

4972
06:17:02,889 --> 06:17:04,729
I'm not even fucking bald.

4973
06:17:15,119 --> 06:17:19,520
All right.

4974
06:17:19,520 --> 06:17:23,279
I can understand if I had like a fryer tuck on the top of my head.

4975
06:17:29,639 --> 06:17:30,279
Thank you, Tingy.

4976
06:17:30,279 --> 06:17:31,880
That was funny.

4977
06:17:31,880 --> 06:17:34,029
Show the hairline right now.

4978
06:17:34,029 --> 06:17:34,349
I can't.

4979
06:17:34,349 --> 06:17:34,830
I'm naked.

4980
06:17:36,349 --> 06:17:37,709
Your deck sucks and you're bald.

4981
06:17:37,709 --> 06:17:38,110
Oh, yeah.

4982
06:17:38,110 --> 06:17:38,509
I forgot.

4983
06:17:38,509 --> 06:17:44,509
Somebody wrote that.

4984
06:17:44,509 --> 06:17:45,709
So vicious.

4985
06:17:45,709 --> 06:17:46,830
So mean.

4986
06:17:46,830 --> 06:17:47,869
So vicious.

4987
06:17:48,669 --> 06:17:52,110
How did I raise such vicious children?

4988
06:17:52,669 --> 06:18:02,279
We've learned it from you.

4989
06:18:02,279 --> 06:18:03,000
No, you didn't.

4990
06:18:03,000 --> 06:18:05,159
I said, have a great night.

4991
06:18:05,159 --> 06:18:07,799
Hope you have a good time and take care, guys.

4992
06:18:07,799 --> 06:18:13,229
How did I raise such vicious, vicious children?

4993
06:18:13,229 --> 06:18:24,330
Am I going to get a Death Stranding stream?

4994
06:18:27,470 --> 06:18:28,349
Maybe.

4995
06:18:28,349 --> 06:18:29,580
Probably.

4996
06:18:30,459 --> 06:18:31,259
Looks interesting.

4997
06:18:36,250 --> 06:18:40,970
There are a couple of big games that are coming out that I know I'll be playing.

4998
06:18:41,610 --> 06:18:46,360
We talked about Cyberpunk 2077 last night.

4999
06:18:46,360 --> 06:18:48,360
And whenever that comes out, absolutely.

5000
06:18:49,000 --> 06:18:52,799
Can we get a Pac-Man stream?

5001
06:18:52,799 --> 06:18:59,200
I'd love to just go back and play that Super Nintendo Pac-Man is a moron game

5002
06:18:59,200 --> 06:19:04,250
and try to actually beat it.

5003
06:19:04,810 --> 06:19:07,520
It would be hell on earth, but I would try.

5004
06:19:07,520 --> 06:19:13,119
But yeah.

5005
06:19:18,659 --> 06:19:31,580
Uh, Tom, Tom York's sleazy eye dot.

5006
06:19:31,580 --> 06:19:32,939
Why is this all in lowercase?

5007
06:19:33,659 --> 06:19:36,139
I'm just going to say Tom.

5008
06:19:42,590 --> 06:19:44,029
Thank you, Tom, for the five dollars.

5009
06:19:48,689 --> 06:19:52,290
I can't wait to, like, have the update where I can see actual capital letters.

5010
06:19:52,930 --> 06:19:56,000
But thank you for the five dollars.

5011
06:19:56,000 --> 06:19:57,200
And they say Pride 500.

5012
06:19:57,200 --> 06:19:57,520
Thank you.

5013
06:19:58,319 --> 06:20:00,080
Slade King, thanks for five dollars.

5014
06:20:00,080 --> 06:20:02,400
Also says Pride 100.

5015
06:20:02,400 --> 06:20:03,439
Pride 100.

5016
06:20:03,439 --> 06:20:05,389
Thank you, Slade King, for the five dollars.

5017
06:20:05,950 --> 06:20:07,540
Both of you back to back there.

5018
06:20:07,540 --> 06:20:08,340
Thank you.

5019
06:20:08,340 --> 06:20:10,139
Oh, the music's not on.

5020
06:20:10,139 --> 06:20:10,939
Fine.

5021
06:20:10,939 --> 06:20:17,310
And we also had a Heartache Cubed ten dollars.

5022
06:20:17,869 --> 06:20:20,740
Jerma, I was the guy with the healing deck.

5023
06:20:20,740 --> 06:20:21,700
GG.

5024
06:20:21,700 --> 06:20:25,619
Good game.

5025
06:20:28,860 --> 06:20:30,540
That deck was fucking pretty good.

5026
06:20:30,540 --> 06:20:31,419
You're a pretty good player.

5027
06:20:32,220 --> 06:20:33,840
Hey, nice job.

5028
06:20:34,720 --> 06:20:36,080
See you on the field.

5029
06:20:36,080 --> 06:20:42,450
But Heartache Cube, thanks for the ten dollars.

5030
06:20:42,450 --> 06:20:45,009
Jerma, it's my birthday in two days.

5031
06:20:45,009 --> 06:20:46,209
Please be my dad.

5032
06:20:47,389 --> 06:20:50,990
I can wish you a happy birthday, but I cannot be your father.

5033
06:20:54,450 --> 06:20:55,889
Thank you for the ten dollars.

5034
06:20:55,889 --> 06:20:59,869
And happy birthday in exactly two days from now.

5035
06:21:02,459 --> 06:21:02,939
Please.

5036
06:21:04,189 --> 06:21:05,549
All right, dad for a minute.

5037
06:21:05,549 --> 06:21:06,110
Here you go.

5038
06:21:06,110 --> 06:21:07,549
You got ten seconds of dead.

5039
06:21:10,110 --> 06:21:13,549
Son, nice work.

5040
06:21:14,419 --> 06:21:16,669
You played good out there.

5041
06:21:16,669 --> 06:21:18,430
See you on the field.

5042
06:21:18,430 --> 06:21:23,169
And then a little, like, just a little, like, I put my fist down,

5043
06:21:23,169 --> 06:21:24,369
and I give you, like, we bumped.

5044
06:21:24,369 --> 06:21:26,779
And it's just, there you go, son.

5045
06:21:26,779 --> 06:21:32,819
But I got a motherfucking one.

5046
06:21:32,819 --> 06:21:34,419
See how tall that grass has gotten?

5047
06:21:36,939 --> 06:21:38,459
And I got a call from your teacher.

5048
06:21:38,939 --> 06:21:41,709
You fell asleep in class, and then when you woke up,

5049
06:21:41,709 --> 06:21:43,310
you made a fart noise with your mouth.

5050
06:21:43,869 --> 06:21:44,830
Go to your room.

5051
06:21:48,750 --> 06:21:50,430
I mean, with my Johnny Walker blue.

5052
06:21:51,150 --> 06:21:55,709
How did I raise such a vicious son?

5053
06:21:56,900 --> 06:22:13,630
How did I raise such a vicious son?

5054
06:22:13,630 --> 06:22:15,310
Go back to the wall, dad.

5055
06:22:17,099 --> 06:22:18,619
No, I'm not going back in there.

5056
06:22:18,619 --> 06:22:19,580
It smells in there.

5057
06:22:20,139 --> 06:22:26,299
Hey, but hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

5058
06:22:26,299 --> 06:22:27,979
And you look over your shoulder.

5059
06:22:27,979 --> 06:22:30,130
And I give you a wink, and I go,

5060
06:22:30,130 --> 06:22:32,740
you're my one and only.

5061
06:22:32,740 --> 06:22:45,889
And then we both nod.

5062
06:22:45,889 --> 06:22:47,409
Let's go get hot dogs tomorrow.

5063
06:22:52,860 --> 06:22:54,939
I think I just, yeah, somebody just said,

5064
06:22:54,939 --> 06:22:55,979
is that a coming-of-age movie?

5065
06:22:55,979 --> 06:22:57,580
I think that was, like, a movie.

5066
06:22:59,709 --> 06:23:02,750
I think that's every movie that has, like, a dad in it.

5067
06:23:07,659 --> 06:23:08,939
That was a long 10 seconds.

5068
06:23:08,939 --> 06:23:10,139
Yes, it was.

5069
06:23:10,139 --> 06:23:11,580
Okay, but happy birthday.

5070
06:23:12,139 --> 06:23:16,430
It was a pleasure being your dad for 10 seconds,

5071
06:23:16,990 --> 06:23:18,909
which was actually like four minutes.

5072
06:23:18,909 --> 06:23:23,729
But no, seriously, thank you so much for 10 bucks.

5073
06:23:23,729 --> 06:23:25,409
Freudian weapon, thanks for five dollars.

5074
06:23:25,409 --> 06:23:26,930
Maybe it's because I think you're insanely cool,

5075
06:23:26,930 --> 06:23:29,009
but I always have the uncanny need to play games

5076
06:23:29,009 --> 06:23:30,369
that you streamed.

5077
06:23:30,369 --> 06:23:32,770
I played Hearthstone once five years ago.

5078
06:23:33,569 --> 06:23:34,849
Didn't care for it then,

5079
06:23:34,849 --> 06:23:37,889
yet now I found my cursor gliding toward the download button.

5080
06:23:38,450 --> 06:23:38,950
Uh-oh.

5081
06:23:39,490 --> 06:23:40,689
But seriously, keep doing your thing.

5082
06:23:40,689 --> 06:23:41,970
Have a good night, Jermaheart.

5083
06:23:43,549 --> 06:23:44,189
Yeah, I don't know.

5084
06:23:44,189 --> 06:23:46,029
I just got, like, bit by the bug for some reason.

5085
06:23:48,819 --> 06:23:50,819
A few old games that I used to play

5086
06:23:52,099 --> 06:23:53,700
more than, like, three, four, five years ago,

5087
06:23:53,700 --> 06:23:55,299
I've started to creep up into my brain again.

5088
06:23:56,110 --> 06:23:57,869
And I'm like, yeah, I remember that was fun.

5089
06:23:58,509 --> 06:24:01,380
Don't be surprised if you see some more of it

5090
06:24:01,380 --> 06:24:15,409
thinking about downloading Hearthstone again.

5091
06:24:16,049 --> 06:24:19,490
I really do like their, this solo stuff.

5092
06:24:20,830 --> 06:24:22,029
It's so replayable.

5093
06:24:22,029 --> 06:24:23,950
The other ones, the first, like, two or three years

5094
06:24:23,950 --> 06:24:25,310
of the game when they made those adventures,

5095
06:24:25,869 --> 06:24:26,430
they were cool.

5096
06:24:27,229 --> 06:24:28,959
But these new adventures,

5097
06:24:28,959 --> 06:24:30,560
you can just play them a million times.

5098
06:24:33,409 --> 06:24:37,889
You just ignored a wave of, uh, something in the chat.

5099
06:24:37,889 --> 06:24:38,529
I don't know what it was.

5100
06:24:39,090 --> 06:24:42,319
The fuck?

5101
06:24:42,319 --> 06:24:45,040
People saying, like, the fuck, like, what the fuck, two?

5102
06:24:45,759 --> 06:24:49,900
Like, times, like, plus two, minus two?

5103
06:24:49,900 --> 06:24:50,400
I don't know.

5104
06:24:50,939 --> 06:25:00,770
I don't know.

5105
06:25:00,770 --> 06:25:01,490
Whatever that is.

5106
06:25:02,209 --> 06:25:04,180
I think it seems like it might be fun.

5107
06:25:07,069 --> 06:25:08,669
But thank you, Freudian, for the five dollars.

5108
06:25:09,950 --> 06:25:12,270
I guess when you see somebody just doing anything,

5109
06:25:12,909 --> 06:25:16,349
you kind of remember the time that you also did it.

5110
06:25:16,349 --> 06:25:18,990
And then maybe you weren't even thinking about Hearthstone today.

5111
06:25:18,990 --> 06:25:20,509
And I just happened to put it in your brain.

5112
06:25:21,229 --> 06:25:23,439
And then you're like, yeah, why not?

5113
06:25:23,439 --> 06:25:24,400
Happens to me all the time.

5114
06:25:26,080 --> 06:25:27,919
Thank you, Trampston, for the five dollars.

5115
06:25:27,919 --> 06:25:28,639
Game sucks.

5116
06:25:28,639 --> 06:25:29,680
I'm going to bed.

5117
06:25:29,680 --> 06:25:30,319
Have a good night.

5118
06:25:30,319 --> 06:25:31,360
I hope you have a good rest.

5119
06:25:33,099 --> 06:25:34,700
Thank you for the five dollars.

5120
06:25:34,700 --> 06:25:37,869
Freudian Weapon, thanks for two dollars and 50 cents.

5121
06:25:37,869 --> 06:25:39,470
By the way, I can't wait for Cooking Simulator.

5122
06:25:39,470 --> 06:25:40,029
Neither can I.

5123
06:25:40,029 --> 06:25:41,229
I've been waiting a long time for it.

5124
06:25:43,659 --> 06:25:48,799
I am very, very excited for tomorrow.

5125
06:25:48,799 --> 06:25:50,639
Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the two fifty.

5126
06:25:50,639 --> 06:25:52,400
Imagine being a Hearthstone stream watcher,

5127
06:25:52,400 --> 06:25:54,479
clicking the most watched Hearthstone stream,

5128
06:25:54,479 --> 06:25:57,439
and seeing the TF2 Spie guy from four years ago

5129
06:25:57,439 --> 06:25:59,439
getting his ass kicked constantly.

5130
06:26:03,490 --> 06:26:05,169
Wait, hold on.

5131
06:26:05,169 --> 06:26:11,740
First of all, you make that sound like the TF2 Spie guy.

5132
06:26:11,740 --> 06:26:13,979
You know, I made more than one video.

5133
06:26:13,979 --> 06:26:22,560
Oh, hey, oh, that's the TF2 Spie guy.

5134
06:26:22,560 --> 06:26:24,319
I have like a thousand uploads.

5135
06:26:33,020 --> 06:26:34,860
You are the TF2 Spie guy.

5136
06:26:35,900 --> 06:26:37,259
No, that's not what I am.

5137
06:26:39,700 --> 06:26:40,979
I'm so many other things.

5138
06:26:42,770 --> 06:26:43,569
I'm so many.

5139
06:26:43,569 --> 06:26:45,330
I'm so much more than that.

5140
06:26:45,330 --> 06:26:48,959
I'm going to go delete them.

5141
06:26:48,959 --> 06:26:50,319
It's time to delete those videos, yeah.

5142
06:26:55,470 --> 06:26:56,909
But yes, thank you for the two.

5143
06:26:56,909 --> 06:26:57,869
That was so funny.

5144
06:27:01,650 --> 06:27:03,169
I hope people save those screenshots

5145
06:27:03,169 --> 06:27:07,259
because that'll get a good laugh out of me

5146
06:27:07,259 --> 06:27:08,700
in the future when I forget about it.

5147
06:27:10,610 --> 06:27:12,209
Podcast Listener, thanks for ten dollars.

5148
06:27:12,209 --> 06:27:14,689
Back at it again with the bits, boys.

5149
06:27:15,409 --> 06:27:16,130
Germa checks.

5150
06:27:16,849 --> 06:27:18,189
There were a lot of them tonight.

5151
06:27:18,990 --> 06:27:19,869
I highly appreciate it.

5152
06:27:19,869 --> 06:27:25,759
You guys hand over huge amounts of money

5153
06:27:25,759 --> 06:27:28,479
and I fucking graciously accept.

5154
06:27:29,040 --> 06:27:29,360
Thank you.

5155
06:27:32,959 --> 06:27:36,830
Also, and then a couple hours ago

5156
06:27:36,830 --> 06:27:38,349
was a hundred dollars from Flutters.

5157
06:27:38,349 --> 06:27:38,990
We touched upon it,

5158
06:27:38,990 --> 06:27:40,750
but Flutters has been around for a long fucking time.

5159
06:27:43,819 --> 06:27:45,180
More than six years.

5160
06:27:45,180 --> 06:27:46,779
So thanks for being around.

5161
06:27:48,610 --> 06:27:51,250
Glad you still think it's interesting enough to watch

5162
06:27:51,250 --> 06:27:51,970
and be a part of.

5163
06:27:56,209 --> 06:27:58,849
Invader Z, thanks for the 250.

5164
06:27:58,849 --> 06:28:01,250
Hey, Germa, have you ever played Magic the Gathering?

5165
06:28:01,250 --> 06:28:03,389
I've been playing Commander a lot recently with friends.

5166
06:28:03,389 --> 06:28:04,830
I was wondering if you played it

5167
06:28:04,830 --> 06:28:06,669
since you're playing Hearthstone, which is similar.

5168
06:28:07,310 --> 06:28:08,830
I think I touched upon it a little bit,

5169
06:28:08,830 --> 06:28:10,669
but just in case you weren't here when I did.

5170
06:28:12,750 --> 06:28:14,669
I'm not really that into card games.

5171
06:28:15,229 --> 06:28:18,049
I don't really play a lot of card games.

5172
06:28:18,049 --> 06:28:24,540
Hearthstone is just very easy to just do random stuff

5173
06:28:24,540 --> 06:28:26,779
and have fun and open up minions

5174
06:28:26,779 --> 06:28:29,099
and have random acts.

5175
06:28:29,099 --> 06:28:34,099
And I don't know if I would be able to get into Magic.

5176
06:28:43,060 --> 06:28:44,740
Lives in Vegas, doesn't like cards.

5177
06:28:44,740 --> 06:28:46,099
No, that's a different kind of card.

5178
06:28:48,830 --> 06:28:50,430
MTG is definitely more involved.

5179
06:28:50,430 --> 06:28:53,540
Yeah, and I mean, obviously Hearthstone stream,

5180
06:28:53,540 --> 06:28:55,299
us hanging out and me dicking around

5181
06:28:55,299 --> 06:28:57,700
and going three and three and like oh and three

5182
06:28:57,700 --> 06:28:59,700
and like losing on heroic and just hanging out.

5183
06:29:00,619 --> 06:29:01,180
That's fine.

5184
06:29:01,180 --> 06:29:02,220
And it's fine.

5185
06:29:02,220 --> 06:29:06,319
And obviously, I don't think I'd want to do that

5186
06:29:06,319 --> 06:29:07,360
with like Magic the Gathering

5187
06:29:07,360 --> 06:29:10,240
because I'm not sure if there's any opportunities to do that.

5188
06:29:11,860 --> 06:29:14,099
Can you just like open up a game of Magic the Gathering

5189
06:29:14,099 --> 06:29:16,180
and just like not know every card

5190
06:29:16,180 --> 06:29:18,880
and try and get destroyed?

5191
06:29:18,880 --> 06:29:24,369
Would that be as interesting as Hearthstone?

5192
06:29:24,369 --> 06:29:33,330
Because I don't know anything about MTG, zero.

5193
06:29:33,330 --> 06:29:35,490
MTG might give you a heart attack,

5194
06:29:35,490 --> 06:29:37,889
but probably not.

5195
06:29:37,889 --> 06:29:42,720
You need to be really good at to have much fun with.

5196
06:29:43,599 --> 06:29:46,080
Yeah, and Hearthstone is right at that kind of layer

5197
06:29:46,080 --> 06:29:49,779
of casual and fun,

5198
06:29:49,779 --> 06:29:52,979
but still has like a good skill ceiling in it

5199
06:29:52,979 --> 06:29:54,580
in various ways.

5200
06:29:54,580 --> 06:29:56,419
There's still a meta in the game.

5201
06:29:56,419 --> 06:29:57,860
There's lots of things you need to know,

5202
06:29:57,860 --> 06:29:58,900
but not like Magic.

5203
06:30:01,009 --> 06:30:03,169
It's got a Magic has a lot more going on

5204
06:30:03,169 --> 06:30:06,529
that I wouldn't even be able to comprehend for a second,

5205
06:30:06,529 --> 06:30:11,490
but probably not.

5206
06:30:11,490 --> 06:30:14,369
And I still got destroyed in Hearthstone.

5207
06:30:14,369 --> 06:30:15,090
Yeah, that's what I mean.

5208
06:30:15,090 --> 06:30:16,689
That's kind of kind of what I'm saying.

5209
06:30:21,299 --> 06:30:22,419
Tingy, thanks for the 250.

5210
06:30:22,419 --> 06:30:23,060
I'm sorry, Dad.

5211
06:30:23,060 --> 06:30:23,540
We love you.

5212
06:30:23,540 --> 06:30:24,740
Jerma Pluto.

5213
06:30:24,740 --> 06:30:25,860
I'll be sorry, son.

5214
06:30:26,500 --> 06:30:27,810
You're a good boy.

5215
06:30:28,369 --> 06:30:32,020
You're just such a smart young lad.

5216
06:30:36,610 --> 06:30:37,009
Thank you.

5217
06:30:40,400 --> 06:30:42,080
M Weldo, thanks for the three dollars.

5218
06:30:42,080 --> 06:30:44,479
Think we all know what happened on that phone call yesterday.

5219
06:30:44,479 --> 06:30:45,599
Keep up the funny bits.

5220
06:30:46,400 --> 06:30:48,830
What happened on the phone call yesterday.

5221
06:30:49,389 --> 06:30:51,840
All right.

5222
06:30:51,840 --> 06:30:53,200
We'll put my agent on the line then.

5223
06:30:53,200 --> 06:30:53,680
I don't know why.

5224
06:30:53,680 --> 06:30:55,680
Is this like, is this Dr. Disrespect?

5225
06:30:55,680 --> 06:30:56,400
Why do I have to go?

5226
06:30:57,279 --> 06:30:59,439
Yeah, I don't know why, ladies and gentlemen.

5227
06:30:59,439 --> 06:31:01,279
I don't know why I have to go through his secretary

5228
06:31:01,279 --> 06:31:02,159
every single time.

5229
06:31:02,880 --> 06:31:12,369
Hello?

5230
06:31:12,369 --> 06:31:13,810
Hey, yeah.

5231
06:31:13,810 --> 06:31:16,130
So, hey, I got some inside knowledge.

5232
06:31:16,130 --> 06:31:19,090
Shroud's trying to tease me about potential revenue share,

5233
06:31:19,810 --> 06:31:21,409
some sort of battle royale experience.

5234
06:31:21,409 --> 06:31:23,009
You got any inside info?

5235
06:31:23,970 --> 06:31:25,500
No, I'm at a movie.

5236
06:31:26,459 --> 06:31:27,500
You still driving that Prius?

5237
06:31:28,939 --> 06:31:32,139
I just like spit all over the screen.

5238
06:31:34,590 --> 06:31:34,830
All right.

5239
06:31:34,830 --> 06:31:35,310
This isn't new.

5240
06:31:35,310 --> 06:31:36,270
Hold on.

5241
06:31:36,270 --> 06:31:39,979
You still driving that Prius?

5242
06:31:40,540 --> 06:31:43,009
It's like.

5243
06:31:43,009 --> 06:31:46,689
What was that?

5244
06:31:46,689 --> 06:31:47,569
Oh, no, I'll call you back.

5245
06:31:55,009 --> 06:31:56,049
I'm going to put it on the screen.

5246
06:32:00,689 --> 06:32:01,650
That's fucking funny.

5247
06:32:08,799 --> 06:32:09,919
No, I'm at a movie.

5248
06:32:13,250 --> 06:32:13,889
I'm going, I'm going.

5249
06:32:13,889 --> 06:32:14,610
I'm getting it on screen.

5250
06:32:14,610 --> 06:32:15,330
I'm getting it on screen.

5251
06:32:15,330 --> 06:32:15,889
Look.

5252
06:32:15,889 --> 06:32:16,450
All right.

5253
06:32:16,450 --> 06:32:17,810
We'll put my agent on the line then.

5254
06:32:17,810 --> 06:32:18,450
I don't know why.

5255
06:32:18,450 --> 06:32:19,250
Like, why do I have to go?

5256
06:32:20,130 --> 06:32:20,369
Yeah.

5257
06:32:21,090 --> 06:32:22,290
I don't know why, ladies and gentlemen.

5258
06:32:22,290 --> 06:32:24,130
I don't know why I have to go through his secretary

5259
06:32:24,130 --> 06:32:25,009
every single time.

5260
06:32:33,779 --> 06:32:35,200
Hello?

5261
06:32:35,200 --> 06:32:36,639
Hey, yeah.

5262
06:32:36,639 --> 06:32:39,040
So, hey, I got some inside knowledge.

5263
06:32:39,040 --> 06:32:42,000
Shroud's trying to tease me about potential revenue share,

5264
06:32:42,720 --> 06:32:44,319
some sort of battle royale experience.

5265
06:32:44,319 --> 06:32:45,759
You got any inside info?

5266
06:32:45,759 --> 06:32:46,400
Why would I?

5267
06:32:47,680 --> 06:32:49,380
No, I'm at a movie.

5268
06:32:49,380 --> 06:32:50,340
You still driving that Prius?

5269
06:32:52,340 --> 06:32:52,979
Yeah, that's like.

5270
06:32:56,509 --> 06:32:57,150
What was that?

5271
06:32:57,150 --> 06:32:58,029
Oh, no, I'll call you back.

5272
06:33:05,860 --> 06:33:07,860
Oh, a Team Fortress Classic with Star.

5273
06:33:07,860 --> 06:33:08,659
Fucking hell, yeah.

5274
06:33:10,580 --> 06:33:12,740
Oh, you got any inside intel on that?

5275
06:33:12,740 --> 06:33:14,099
And am I the secretary?

5276
06:33:14,659 --> 06:33:17,380
I got to go through his secretary and it's me.

5277
06:33:24,509 --> 06:33:26,509
Here's a link for those of you that want it.

5278
06:33:26,509 --> 06:33:27,759
That was funny.

5279
06:33:28,319 --> 06:33:33,869
That was M Weldo.

5280
06:33:33,869 --> 06:33:34,669
Thanks for the three bucks.

5281
06:33:35,229 --> 06:33:39,740
And thanks for the video.

5282
06:33:41,790 --> 06:33:45,310
And what do you say we get the credits on the screen?

5283
06:33:45,310 --> 06:33:46,830
This is going to be pretty wild.

5284
06:33:47,549 --> 06:33:50,979
You ready?

5285
06:33:51,229 --> 06:33:54,669
Here are all the subs from this stream.

5286
06:33:55,310 --> 06:34:04,319
As a rumor right there.

5287
06:34:04,959 --> 06:34:09,360
Jesus.

5288
06:34:13,330 --> 06:34:16,290
It had to have been at least a few, like more than a few hundred.

5289
06:34:20,529 --> 06:34:22,209
Opening Hearthstone card packs.

5290
06:34:29,250 --> 06:34:34,459
It's going so fast that it's lagging the plugin.

5291
06:34:37,090 --> 06:34:38,849
I'm losing, I'm dropping frames.

5292
06:34:38,849 --> 06:34:40,290
My frame rate is being dropped here.

5293
06:34:42,720 --> 06:34:43,520
But thank you all of you.

5294
06:34:43,520 --> 06:34:45,040
Thank you to all the community subs.

5295
06:34:45,599 --> 06:34:48,979
There was a shit loader in that first 30, 40 minutes.

5296
06:34:49,540 --> 06:34:51,599
You guys are too kind.

5297
06:34:51,599 --> 06:34:52,000
Thank you.

5298
06:34:52,720 --> 06:34:59,150
What do I say in the phone?

5299
06:34:59,150 --> 06:35:01,150
Somebody's screaming, put the phone down.

5300
06:35:05,860 --> 06:35:13,840
Well, it's me screaming it, but thank you to all of you.

5301
06:35:14,770 --> 06:35:16,209
We do have two more bits that came in.

5302
06:35:16,209 --> 06:35:18,049
We have Spooge for three dollars.

5303
06:35:18,770 --> 06:35:20,849
Hey, Germo, still nine months sub.

5304
06:35:20,849 --> 06:35:21,650
Where's the baby?

5305
06:35:22,209 --> 06:35:24,529
Also, what are some games you're looking forward to seeing at E3?

5306
06:35:25,090 --> 06:35:28,610
I know you had a rough time with Mountain Blade, but was that 2019?

5307
06:35:32,029 --> 06:35:32,830
It was, wasn't it?

5308
06:35:34,669 --> 06:35:34,990
Okay.

5309
06:35:35,549 --> 06:35:37,549
Yeah, we have a candidate.

5310
06:35:37,549 --> 06:35:38,509
Yeah, we have a candidate.

5311
06:35:44,419 --> 06:35:46,509
Yeah, well.

5312
06:35:46,509 --> 06:35:51,169
But, uh, give multiplayer a chance because that's where it really shines

5313
06:35:51,169 --> 06:35:53,569
and keeps an eye out for its sequel.

5314
06:35:53,569 --> 06:35:56,290
Or keep an eye out for its sequel, Bannerlord, if it ever comes out.

5315
06:36:00,500 --> 06:36:02,259
I can't, this is still going this fast.

5316
06:36:05,709 --> 06:36:07,069
Yeah, this mod's for two.

5317
06:36:07,790 --> 06:36:13,520
I just got so soured on it because I just, it was, I don't know.

5318
06:36:13,520 --> 06:36:15,759
It was half of me trying to figure out what to do

5319
06:36:15,759 --> 06:36:20,580
and the other half of trying to, you know, having people telling me things

5320
06:36:20,580 --> 06:36:22,259
and what to do and where to go.

5321
06:36:23,060 --> 06:36:24,819
It's kind of a perfect storm of things.

5322
06:36:25,700 --> 06:36:33,200
There's a lot of systems in that game that you have to pay attention to.

5323
06:36:33,919 --> 06:36:37,439
Bannerlord 2040.

5324
06:36:37,439 --> 06:36:40,240
Yeah, something like that.

5325
06:36:45,180 --> 06:36:48,060
Allmu said, I have surgery coming up and they're going to put me under.

5326
06:36:48,700 --> 06:36:51,709
It is my first time, so I can get some support.

5327
06:36:52,270 --> 06:36:55,900
Yeah, hopefully it goes well.

5328
06:36:56,540 --> 06:36:58,319
Hopefully your surgery goes well.

5329
06:37:00,180 --> 06:37:04,590
Anesthesia is a lot scarier the way that it seems rather than the way that it is.

5330
06:37:05,150 --> 06:37:09,330
So don't worry about that.

5331
06:37:09,970 --> 06:37:15,860
When I was put under, it was really comfortable.

5332
06:37:18,049 --> 06:37:19,569
I just kind of fell right asleep.

5333
06:37:19,569 --> 06:37:21,970
You don't really even, you don't really even know.

5334
06:37:25,180 --> 06:37:27,419
You're just lying there wherever you are

5335
06:37:28,220 --> 06:37:31,099
and somebody's like, okay, hey, you comfortable?

5336
06:37:31,099 --> 06:37:31,500
You good?

5337
06:37:31,500 --> 06:37:32,459
And it's like, yeah, I'm all right.

5338
06:37:32,459 --> 06:37:32,860
I'm okay.

5339
06:37:33,950 --> 06:37:35,869
And they, you know, slowly give it to you

5340
06:37:36,590 --> 06:37:43,389
and you, it just kind of, not in like a weird, scary way or anything,

5341
06:37:43,389 --> 06:37:47,020
but you just kind of, almost like you just kind of wake up.

5342
06:37:48,459 --> 06:37:51,970
You just wake up.

5343
06:37:51,970 --> 06:37:55,250
It's strange because you'll feel, you'll have the,

5344
06:37:55,250 --> 06:38:00,580
if you have an anesthesia in an IV, you just start to drift a second

5345
06:38:00,580 --> 06:38:10,580
and one, two, you're awake in the recovery room.

5346
06:38:10,580 --> 06:38:12,659
So that's kind of the way that it's happened to me

5347
06:38:12,659 --> 06:38:14,900
the last one or two times that I've had it.

5348
06:38:14,900 --> 06:38:18,459
You'll get some food if you can eat,

5349
06:38:18,459 --> 06:38:19,740
depending on what you have in for surgery.

5350
06:38:22,799 --> 06:38:25,979
But it's a lot, and they all know this,

5351
06:38:26,619 --> 06:38:28,830
these people are pros, right?

5352
06:38:30,290 --> 06:38:31,569
They know that people are nervous.

5353
06:38:31,569 --> 06:38:33,810
They know that, you know, it's kind of stressful.

5354
06:38:34,450 --> 06:38:35,729
You've got like five people.

5355
06:38:36,290 --> 06:38:38,689
When I had my colonoscopy this past week,

5356
06:38:38,689 --> 06:38:41,009
it was, you know, there's like four or five people

5357
06:38:41,009 --> 06:38:42,610
in the room all have masks on.

5358
06:38:42,610 --> 06:38:45,439
Like, okay, like, come over here.

5359
06:38:45,439 --> 06:38:47,439
And it's just like, oh, okay, all right, all right.

5360
06:38:47,439 --> 06:38:49,099
How are we doing?

5361
06:38:49,099 --> 06:38:52,430
But they're all, they want to take really good care of you.

5362
06:38:52,430 --> 06:38:57,889
They care about it.

5363
06:38:57,889 --> 06:39:01,950
Then most surgeons, most doctors and most anesthesiologists,

5364
06:39:01,950 --> 06:39:02,990
they've been doing it for a long time.

5365
06:39:03,549 --> 06:39:12,270
They know exactly what to do.

5366
06:39:12,270 --> 06:39:13,549
So I wouldn't worry about it at all.

5367
06:39:15,630 --> 06:39:16,430
You're going to get up

5368
06:39:16,430 --> 06:39:24,180
and you're not even going to realize it happened.

5369
06:39:24,180 --> 06:39:25,060
But I wish you luck.

5370
06:39:28,099 --> 06:39:33,709
All the love and support to you for real.

5371
06:39:33,709 --> 06:39:34,669
And let us know how it goes.

5372
06:39:38,029 --> 06:39:40,669
And finally, we have potato trapdoor

5373
06:39:40,669 --> 06:39:42,029
for $5 come in right now.

5374
06:39:43,250 --> 06:39:44,770
Six years of watching German on YouTube

5375
06:39:44,770 --> 06:39:46,209
and I finally watch a stream.

5376
06:39:46,209 --> 06:39:46,930
Glad to be here.

5377
06:39:46,930 --> 06:39:47,729
Welcome.

5378
06:39:47,729 --> 06:39:49,310
Hope you had fun.

5379
06:39:49,310 --> 06:39:50,270
Hope you enjoyed the stream.

5380
06:39:50,270 --> 06:39:52,669
And thanks for being around for six years.

5381
06:39:54,509 --> 06:39:55,389
Time flies.

5382
06:39:57,310 --> 06:40:00,220
Flies, flies, flies.

5383
06:40:00,220 --> 06:40:05,970
I will see you all tomorrow.

5384
06:40:05,970 --> 06:40:06,849
Same time.

5385
06:40:06,849 --> 06:40:10,209
Well, we started a little on the earlier side today.

5386
06:40:13,200 --> 06:40:15,200
Yeah, between three and four, same normal time.

5387
06:40:16,259 --> 06:40:17,220
Cooking simulator.

5388
06:40:17,779 --> 06:40:21,759
It's going to get rowdy in here tomorrow.

5389
06:40:22,400 --> 06:40:23,659
I can tell you that.

5390
06:40:23,659 --> 06:40:25,740
I'll do some stream legends for those of you that want it.

5391
06:40:26,380 --> 06:40:29,599
See you tomorrow.

5392
06:40:29,599 --> 06:40:31,659
Get some sleep.

5393
06:40:31,659 --> 06:40:34,750
Have a great rest of the night.

5394
06:40:34,750 --> 06:40:36,750
Goodbye, everybody.

5395
06:40:38,139 --> 06:40:38,540
Take care.

5396
06:40:39,700 --> 06:40:48,349
Ta-ta.
