1
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:21,609
Just making sure it works. Hello everybody. How you doing? Good afternoon. Hope all is well,

2
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:36,649
wherever you are. He speaks. Sometimes. Sometimes he speaks. Yeah, I saw the house flipper update.

3
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:46,060
Garden flipper, right? Is it blood on my coffee cup? No. No, it's dried coffee. I was like,

4
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:58,200
what are they? What? Drinking blood. No, but how you doing? Today we're gonna do something

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:06,659
we did last week. I thought it was a lot of fun. And I want to try it again. MS DOS,

6
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:16,379
the archive website. It's still up. It's still available. So we're gonna do some more of that.

7
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:24,120
It's gonna be different this time, though. Last time, we had a little thing on the right

8
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,730
where you could scroll. You cannot do that this time. We're gonna try it differently.

9
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:40,010
This time, we are going to pick three from the list. And then I'm just scrolling after

10
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:50,310
we do three. Or I might veto two of them and then just scroll. We'll see. All right,

11
00:01:50,310 --> 00:02:00,519
I tweeted, right? I think we're good to go. Mario's gonna put this on a fort of a kind.

12
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,719
I don't know. I don't think we're gonna see Mario again. Does Mario have more than one

13
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,000
MS DOS game? And are we going to come across it? That's the real question.

14
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:24,569
Why not just play every game? I can't do that. There's too many of them. All right, so

15
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:32,060
welcome again. Happy, happy Saturday. And why don't we just get this off the screen and

16
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:38,409
look at that. Don't click yet. It's not ready yet. I believe this is where we left off.

17
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:51,139
I think it is because I was on page five. So like we did last time,

18
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:57,750
notice there's nothing on this side of the screen. Nope. Just a central location.

19
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:12,199
What's this page called again? This is the archive.org MS DOS archive.org.

20
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:22,060
There's software on here too, but I don't, I didn't put it on here. I'm only doing the games

21
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:34,629
because the software is command prompts and video. No, there was no video editing.

22
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:42,150
What programs existed that went on games where I missed off? Get ready to click.

23
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:54,439
Here's your first click of the evening. You can do it now. Software spreadsheets. Yeah,

24
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,620
it's about, it's not, it's boring stuff. So let's see. First pick of the day.

25
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:12,460
Looks like we have something called Alter Ego Mail. Is this a personality test? There's one

26
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:20,459
of two things. This is either personality test or porn game. We'll have to find out.

27
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:29,290
It's from Activision. Did Activision ever make any porn games? I don't think they may have.

28
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:42,699
Who knows? Okay. That's a pretty significant amount of people that want to see Alter Ego Mail.

29
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:09,240
All right. Let's go. Okay. Let's start it. Are you ready? Three, two, one. Here it comes.

30
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,360
Activision presents Alter Ego. Whoa, what's going on down there? You can like scan people.

31
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:23,480
Please enter your name. Okay. We're going to go with Jerma. No, should I put that? Should

32
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,769
I put something else? Should I put like, I don't want to put my name. What if somebody has

33
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:51,430
it? I wonder who that could be. Jared. Jared. Alter Ego personality development profile.

34
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,970
Use the arrow keys to move the pointer next to a response. Press space to select that response.

35
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,089
Let me select my own personality. Let the computer select my personality.

36
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,879
Let computer select my personality. Then let me examine or edit it.

37
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:14,490
I need to make my own personality, right? Yeah, I gotta, I can't, I'm not gonna let

38
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,060
somebody tell me who I am. I will probably try to answer these questions honestly.

39
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:33,110
Yeah, that's true. I'm likely to speak whatever comes to my mind. Yeah, I will. I do. I do that

40
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,879
all the time on stream. I just, shit just comes out. I'm a light sleeper who stirs

41
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:45,689
at even the slightest sound. This is absolutely true. I, I'm so bad. It doesn't matter.

42
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:53,300
A dog barking like 500 yards down that way will wake me up. Somebody's sneezing

43
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:02,810
in my neighbor's house. I'll wake up to it. Revenge is sweet. How do I get there? Oh,

44
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,889
I'm likely to speak whatever comes to my mind. I'll probably try to answer normally. I'm a light

45
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:14,230
sleeper. Revenge is sweet. How do I answer this? What kind, what do you mean revenge? Revenge

46
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:21,110
is sweet. What kind of revenge? I don't know. That's, that might not be true. I don't know

47
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:29,060
if I can answer that one. But like revenge, just general revenge. Do you like to get

48
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:37,660
revenge? No, it doesn't do anything. Have you seen every movie ever made? I often feel slow,

49
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:48,250
tired, and down in the dumps. This, uh, he's a liar. I'm, uh, all right, hold on. Is this,

50
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:55,430
this is a two parter here though. I often feel slow, tired, and down in the dumps. I often

51
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,970
feel like tired, but not down in the dumps. That's not completely true. An important part

52
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:06,980
of every job is knowing who to impress, Twitch chat. I am fascinated by car accidents and

53
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:19,220
their disaster scenes. I don't think, no, no. Why would this be a question? See, this is one of

54
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,980
those tests where it's trying to find the psycho. Oh, I feel sorry. Sometimes I'm tired. Oh,

55
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:31,639
impress people if you want. Yeah, car accidents are cool, right? Yeah, no, no, no, wait. The

56
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:40,659
people who know me best like me as a person. Yeah, I think so. I think people like, like

57
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:46,980
people that know me well like me. I'm extremely sensitive to criticism. Yeah, that was that

58
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,820
one time like, like four nights ago somebody said my stream sucked and I got really mad.

59
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:56,179
Uh, I get nervous performing in front of people even when the task is something I know by heart.

60
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:04,860
Nope. The people around me seem happier than I do. I don't, I don't know about that.

61
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:18,629
Uh, the people around me seem, I don't think so. No. I often get the urge to touch walls

62
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:23,929
on which wet paint signs are hung. No, because then you get paint on your hands

63
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:31,990
for the rest of the day and it sucks. I've done it. When I am ill, I become short tempered and

64
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:42,809
snap at people. Ill? No, I just like kind of sleep. I just, I just kind of do my own thing.

65
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,450
An important mattress, I usually follow my, no, no, one on important matters. I usually

66
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:59,049
follow my parents advice even when I disagree with it. No, I mean, my mother's got great

67
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:05,049
advice, but you know, I like to, I like to be me. You know, it is possible that I like, I take

68
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:11,860
advice and then I, I kind of let it sit for a while and then I say, what about my idea? And

69
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,210
then I kind of mold them together and then I get the best idea. It is possible that we live

70
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:23,259
in a world where people can watch our every move. Yes. That, that, that, yes, that's

71
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:31,610
true. Uh, it is very possible. I don't know when they made this game, but it is, is real.

72
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:40,230
When I'm in a quiet place, I get the urge to scream. Yeah. This is why I can't go to the movies.

73
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,710
I can't sit there, but no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, that's, that's kind of,

74
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:51,059
I send this, assuming that I just scream at the movies. No, no, that's not quiet.

75
00:10:51,059 --> 00:11:01,639
And I meant like sit still. No, that's true. I need like stimulation or I lose my fucking

76
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,799
mind. It's okay to tell a white lie if it is guaranteed to bring great personal gain.

77
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:33,860
Done that quite, quite a bit on this stream. I'm kidding. It, no, it's true. Wait, this is,

78
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,309
we're talking, we're talking, I'm not a sociopath. Okay. I lied about Ace Attorney. So it happens.

79
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,909
I didn't, but I didn't though. That you just, you just perceiving that as a lie.

80
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,129
It is often pointless to try to discuss problems with other people. What? No. What?

81
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,980
No, somebody like to bounce a vent off of and bounce off. No, what are you talking about?

82
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,519
I'm easily embarrassed. No. Dermaraptor proves that. Children should be seen and not heard.

83
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:13,720
Are we talking about like, are we talking about like on the airplane? Like when the kids like

84
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,519
screaming and crying and like kicking the back of the seat. Is that what they're talking about

85
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:27,110
here? What are they talking about? What does it mean? Children should be seen and not heard.

86
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,220
No, but like kids are fun. Kids are like funny and interesting and they say all kinds, no.

87
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,120
I find it difficult to break the ice in conversations with people I barely know.

88
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,610
That's not true. My parents were strict disciplinarians. No. You can usually judge

89
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:56,250
a person by first impressions. No. People, no, I don't think so. One way of getting people

90
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,570
to treat you fairly is to take an aggressive stance and make them win you over. What?

91
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:14,090
What kind of weird, like take an aggressive stance and make them win you over. But what

92
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,399
does aggressive stance mean? Like you really get out there and you'd be, what does that

93
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:27,830
mean? Do you just say something crazy and then see if they like you? I mean, I usually,

94
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:37,769
I'm pretty boisterous. Maybe. Yeah. I think that questions like this are stupid and meaningless.

95
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:45,080
Like that. Yes. This one. Yes. I do think this question is meaningless because it's just,

96
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,529
it doesn't mean anything. Uh, dark soul. Thanks to the five community subs, dark soul,

97
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:55,860
a five sub drop from dark soul. That's the way this is the game. This is the game. We

98
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,820
haven't started the game yet. Please select the stage of life at which you would like

99
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:09,940
to begin the game. Birth and infancy. What? You could be a baby. Are we going to try to

100
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:19,480
live all through our whole life here? Birth and infancy. What if I, all right. Welcome

101
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:27,350
to birth and infancy. Every man is the architect of his own fortune. Solace, Gaia,

102
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:36,230
Solistius, Crispus. Speech to Caesar on the state. Sec I. Am I Julius Caesar?

103
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:48,179
Is that me? You are in a warm, dark, comfortable place. This has been your place since you became

104
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:55,419
aware that you are alive. It's almost time to enter a different world now. Select an action.

105
00:14:55,419 --> 00:15:05,110
Stay in a little longer. Come out fighting. Come out peacefully. Stay in a little longer.

106
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:12,889
You start swinging at the doctor. I'm staying in a little longer. Okay. You certainly can't be

107
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:18,250
blamed for wanting to stay someplace safe and warm. Besides, you are learning early the social

108
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:36,710
merits of being fashionably late. Sure am. What time is it? 4 15 p.m.

109
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:45,799
Don't you think your mother has had enough aggravation carrying you in her belly for

110
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:55,450
nine long months? Stop being a freeloader and step out into the real world. All right, fine.

111
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:07,419
I'm gonna come out peacefully. I never come out fighting when I'm late. I'm always just like,

112
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:16,700
hey, what's going on, YouTubers? What a good sport. Are you sure you're ready for this?

113
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,019
It can get pretty hectic out there. I'll give you one more chance to try to stay a while

114
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:24,539
longer. Would you like it? What do you mean? Why are you like making me sign up a game tap

115
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:34,789
again? This is the game tap thing all over again. That's the spirit. You are an easy

116
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:38,230
delivery. No, no, no. I was trying to say no. I got fucking conned into coming out here.

117
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,940
That's the spirit. You are an easy delivery. Your mom and dad took special classes to help you.

118
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:49,830
Go out there and give them heck. You're still too young to swear.

119
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:56,460
Happy birthday and welcome to the world. From now on, life will begin to change rapidly.

120
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,940
You will have to learn to accept responsibility, build up your resources, and manage

121
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:07,910
yourself physically and emotionally. The events that transpire over the course of the next

122
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:16,230
few days include your rich aunt Martha places a $500 bond and trust for you. Thanks. You're the

123
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:23,210
most beautiful baby in the maternity ward and everyone takes your picture. All right. Starting

124
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:28,549
out pretty good here. Your father buys you a baseball bat and glove for you to use in a year

125
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:35,960
or so when you get older. A baseball bat and a glove when I'm one and a half years old. How's

126
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,900
that gonna work? I'm gonna be one with a... you can't even fucking think. What is this?

127
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:51,799
Do I have to select something? Oh shit. What is this? I don't know. Should I do like the emote

128
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:58,329
face or hearts? Which one of these do I do? I don't know what these mean. All right. I'm going

129
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:04,220
for like the I'm so intelligent. Lying on your stomach in the crib, you notice an interesting

130
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,900
object and arms distance away. It has a round shape at the top and a ring on the bottom.

131
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:22,599
Select a mood. Anger, frustration, determination. Determination and grasp for object.

132
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,180
You have the fighting spirit of your uncle Bill. You sneak and crawl on your belly like a combat

133
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:33,059
soldier heading into battle. You reach your destination, grasp the rattle confidently,

134
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:40,839
and drool on it in victory. Intellectual sphere shows a marked increase. Shake the rattle.

135
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:44,359
Keep drooling on it. Emit a pleasurable yell. I would do that. I'd be like,

136
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,119
this stimulates vocal cords and language centers in your brain. Good language skills

137
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,519
are essential to development. Intellectual sphere increases. If no one is looking,

138
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:03,609
give a little yell yourself for choosing this option. Go on. Did you do it? I actually did.

139
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:12,539
Select an action. Yes or no. What? Yes or no to what? Yes. Oh no, I did. Yeah, I did it.

140
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:19,130
Yes, I did. Good. I just gave you some extra social points for being good sport. I'm already

141
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:29,660
getting some good points here. Um, now where? What is it? What is this? A woman walks into

142
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:40,470
a room holding a blanket and a bottle with warm white liquid. Selective mood. Happy. Action. Coup.

143
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:50,809
Happy and coup. Why would I be angry? I just got extreme victory. I would coup.

144
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:55,380
Nothing like a nice warm bottle and a quick hug from mom to get a kid ready to face the world.

145
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,940
As she walks toward you with the bottle, she sees you smiling and interprets this as a

146
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,680
sign that you want to play with her. She picks you up and holds you for 10 minutes.

147
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:15,990
This presents you with quite a dilemma. Cry. Okay, mom can see that you have had enough

148
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:25,769
for now. She feeds you your bottle and walks away. You don't have very many skills yet.

149
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:33,990
As a matter of fact, life is pretty boring. Restless and irritable. Uh, restless and

150
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,000
irritable. I want to look around. Feel like you're going stir crazy. I can just imagine.

151
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,700
The room is filled with bright colors, but you have trouble focusing on any of them.

152
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,259
Cry and yell for attention. Keep looking around. Keep looking around. You look around

153
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:53,480
and see a large blur about 11 inches away from your eye. Every once in a while, it moves.

154
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,420
Hey, wait a minute. Just as you had that thought, it moved again. Keep looking.

155
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:07,140
Congratulations. You found your hand. This may not seem like much of a big discovery,

156
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,619
but it is. You will have to learn how to control your hands as part of childhood

157
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:16,329
development. When you are an adolescent, those hands are going to get you into quite

158
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:27,930
a bit of trouble because that requires a different kind of hand control. This is stupid.

159
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,569
You're lying down in your crib and are greeted by a nosy neighbor who has a child just around

160
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:37,940
your age. The neighbor says, my, look at that funny little nose. She turns to your

161
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,660
mother and adds, don't worry, dear. I hear that noses are the last thing to look truly

162
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:51,859
human. She picks you up. Uh, angry and vengeful. Collect a mouthful of drool.

163
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:56,150
A nice puddle of saliva has formed on the inside of your mouth. Open your mouth and

164
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,829
drool on the neighbor. Yeah. Talk about my fucking nose. I'm going to ruin your shirt.

165
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:11,299
A gooey stream showers your neighbor's face and hands while you give her a glassy-eyed smile.

166
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:20,380
She places you back in the crib and excuses herself. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. That's

167
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:33,339
not revenge. It is. Maybe it is. It's all right. But it didn't feel sweet. It was just fun.

168
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:38,539
There should have been, revenge is not sweet, but could be fun if you're a baby sometimes.

169
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:44,539
You're lying on the floor of a big room on a soft furry blanket. You are on your back,

170
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,180
staring at shadows that sometimes creep across the ceiling. Every so often mom or dad passes

171
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,920
by and makes a funny face. Your hands grope in all directions and your feet pat the floor

172
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:07,190
gently, almost out of your control. Happy, sad, mad. Happy and make an O-shape with your mouth.

173
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,089
You pucker your cheeks in and out and take short, quick breaths. The skin on your face

174
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:24,579
feels alternately tight and loose. A person walks by and twirls their fingers at you.

175
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:32,460
Turn around towards the person. You are too young to keep the person in view for a long

176
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,930
time. Whoever it is that moves past in a blur. All right, here we go. We're going to develop

177
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:45,000
some brain here. You are lying down in the crib while your mom and dad are speaking in the other

178
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,960
room. You hear their voices, deep and muffled, from beyond the door. Why aren't they paying

179
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:58,740
attention to you? Make noise! Get over here! You begin to cry. This alarms your parents

180
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,410
and is a negative way of attracting attention. Your dad comes in holding a bottle of warm

181
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:17,079
milk which satisfies you temporarily. Uh-oh. Wrong. Wrong choice. You've just awakened from a nice

182
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:24,970
long nap. Your mom comes in the room and wants to hold you. I'm a little cranky. I'm a little

183
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:40,380
cranky, but I'm still happy. You have made an inappropriate response. What about a sleepy smile?

184
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,720
I can do that, right? It's a dog's life, isn't it? Nothing to do all day except eat,

185
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,079
sleep, and wonder what life will be like when you're older. Does life really change after two?

186
00:24:52,359 --> 00:25:01,819
A dog's life? Am I a dog? Mom is coming closer. Sure. Very good. Eye contact with your caretakers

187
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:06,539
is very reinforcing to them. Parents often mistakenly think that it is the children

188
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:12,140
who need all the attention. Believe me, parents want it too. Your eye contact with

189
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:19,299
her makes her smile. Social and emotional spheres are increasing. Smile back. Smiling

190
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:23,619
makes your mom feel especially loving towards you. She brings your face close to her face.

191
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:38,779
Your face is touch. Be still or move my mouth. I'm gonna move my mouth. You just gave your first

192
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:44,700
kiss. This may not seem like a very big deal to you, but is very important for your mother.

193
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,180
The bad part is that now you will have to repeat this act until your entire family

194
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:56,730
becomes aware of your new talent. You can avoid kissing overly affectionate relatives

195
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:08,710
by dribbling on them at just the right moment. What are these? What is this? It's time to go to

196
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,910
Aunt Lucy's house. It's chilly outside and you need to be dressed in a coverall type suit.

197
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:26,440
Go limp! All right, I'm gonna... I don't want to go. I'm gonna go limp. Resist. You react

198
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,000
against being squeezed into this uncomfortable suit by crying and sending out long sirens

199
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,859
of protest. Your grandmother graciously offers to help. Cooperate for grandma. Keep giving

200
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:46,279
everyone a hard time. Not a very wise choice. How do you expect to motivate grandma to spoil

201
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:51,079
you if you are not willing to make your mom look foolish in front of her by persisting

202
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:57,819
to act like a little brat? Would you like to give in now or make everyone even angrier with

203
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:09,559
you? Your mother pulls you away from your grandmother and literally stuffs you into the

204
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:15,299
suit. It is tucked in and bunched up in all the wrong places and you are uncomfortable.

205
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:20,259
Your grandmother protests but to no avail. Your mom has the last word and your physical

206
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:27,589
sphere suffers temporarily short-term discomfort. I didn't want to go. I didn't want to be put

207
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:36,170
in the suit. You're quietly playing with your father's brand new electronic calculator. Look

208
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:44,519
the back of it lifts off very easily. Inquisitive. Look but don't touch. Look,

209
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,809
touch and take apart. Your little fingers make efficient pliers. You pluck out the electronic

210
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:56,650
components tasting one or two as you go along. They're definitely not for eating. You know dad

211
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:04,420
will be pleased at your fixing his toy. Uh I don't think dad's gonna be happy that his infant

212
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:17,930
son is eating small parts of a calculator. Oh that's my son the little Einstein. You

213
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:23,269
are exploring the playpen and are feeling very lively. Like a prize fighter you grab hold

214
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:31,509
of the playpen bars and shake back and forth flexing your knees. Daring. Determined. Daring.

215
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:38,680
Let go of the playpen. You raise your hands over your head triumphantly. Boom! You go right down

216
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:44,680
on your bottom. Thank heavens for padded bottoms. You wobble back up standing.

217
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:52,970
You wobble back up to standing position. All right. Navigate around the crib holding onto

218
00:28:52,970 --> 00:29:00,329
the bars. All right we're gonna do this correct. With ballet-like movements you step over

219
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:05,849
the musical ball and four stuffed animals. You've perfected this form of locomotion.

220
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:13,319
Would you like to let go again? Yes. Boom! Ouch! You crash to the floor like a sack of

221
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:20,599
potatoes. Your rear end is beginning to feel sore. You want to try one more time? Yes.

222
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:26,200
The thrill of victory. You stumble across the crib like a punch-drunk sailor and firmly grasp

223
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,339
the rail on the other side. You've taken your first steps. Soon you'll be tripping

224
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:47,849
the light fantastic. Chasing women and running away from spankings. What? All right let's...

225
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:51,930
Mom and dad are entertaining some friends and you are minding your own business sitting quietly

226
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:57,509
in a corner of the room. Suddenly a man with a big nose and a shiny head puts his face right

227
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:05,049
up to yours. It said something in a loud voice. Scream in a loud voice. Hit the man

228
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:15,589
in the nose. You give him a right to the snoz which feels rough and oily. You are terrified

229
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:20,150
and he thinks you are playing with him. Fortunately your dad spots him and ushers him back to the

230
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:33,319
to bother people closer to his own age. I had to knock that guy up. I fucking dropped him in one

231
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:47,099
punch. Was it a clown? You're sitting in your high chair eating your lunch which consists of

232
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,980
crackers, strained peas, and a mug of milk. You're just learning how to eat with utensils.

233
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:04,220
Escape from the high chair. You will probably do much traveling when you get older. This isn't

234
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,900
bad provided that you are not traveling to avoid responsibility. You slip out of the chair

235
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:21,779
but hit the floor much harder than you expected. I'm getting out of here. Nothing, not even a

236
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:27,299
sore bottom, can stop you now. You're headed for daylight. You go for the blocks with the

237
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:34,809
speed of a charging buffalo. You encounter a large leg. Bite the leg. Dodge. You fake left

238
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:39,450
and move right. What am I, a fucking running back? Your mom is caught temporarily off guard

239
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:45,130
and once again you are unobstructed. Your confidence increases even though you are eventually

240
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:55,539
caught and dragged back to the high chair. That's too bad. I'm gonna use the spoon.

241
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,910
Using hatchet-like strokes you pulverize the cracker until it is unrecognizable.

242
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:09,480
Yell and pound on the high chair. Quietly sprinkle the crumbs all over the floor. That's

243
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:16,759
that one. I would do that one. All the characteristics related to extreme sneakiness

244
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:22,279
and hostility have increased. Your actions will not be detected until the next time someone

245
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:30,819
sweeps the floor. How do you feel about this? Good. You are even more sneaky and mean than I

246
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:41,829
thought. What kind of adult will you turn out to be if you keep this up? I'm not gonna,

247
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:51,960
it's not chaotic evil, it's lowkey. While being taken to the park your dad meets an

248
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,819
old colleague buddy who's wheeling a baby about your age. As the two dads talk you

249
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:10,660
casually begin to eye the baby in the other carriage. Curious and different. I wouldn't,

250
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:16,490
I don't think I would be aggressive. Very curious. Put your finger near the other baby's face.

251
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:21,349
Yeah, I'm just curious. I just want to see what their face feels like. A baby,

252
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:29,799
you wonder if it has all the same parts as you. I'm just like, I'm just, I don't even

253
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,440
know where my hands are going. Just baby face. You poke the other baby right in the eye.

254
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,599
He starts to cry. Your father is slightly embarrassed. The other dad is worried that

255
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:49,369
his little baby is not macho enough to take a little poke. Select an action. Pat the other

256
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:58,630
baby to con- why would I know that? I wouldn't know that's what you would do. Leave the baby

257
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:05,799
alone. All right, it's okay. I'm sorry. I apologize. It doesn't work. Geez. This kid is

258
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,840
a crybaby. You are learning that sometimes no matter how nice you are to some people, they

259
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,750
just don't appreciate it. Your dad moves you away from the other baby and gives you a

260
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:23,429
cookie to keep you occupied. At least he appreciates your empathy. So I poked this

261
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:31,980
baby in the eye, caused it physical pain, could not believe that I didn't like my

262
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:48,619
pat to the head I gave it afterwards, and I got a cookie. Okay, my first x-ray. Up until

263
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:54,070
this point in life, Weasley Wabbit, your stuffed toy has been one of your best friends.

264
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,550
You take him everywhere with you, but he is beginning to get on your on your nerves, I

265
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:05,050
thought it said. I don't know, I'm going down this like evil baby path. I didn't think it was

266
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:10,889
gonna be like you rip off his head. You take him everywhere with you, but he's beginning to get

267
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:16,329
on in years. One of his ears is torn off and a recent eye injury has made his face like

268
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:23,139
a little lopsided. It is suggested that Weasley should be retired. You wake up one day to

269
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:33,130
discover Weasley has been moved from the place where you last spotted him. Panic, suspicious,

270
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:40,380
and seek information. You confront mom with the fact that Weasley was not in the spot where he

271
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:48,699
was last deposited. She claims to not have seen him either. You are satisfied with this

272
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:58,090
answer, not satisfied with this answer. Where is Weasley Wabbit? Wisely, you persist. This

273
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:03,659
time she tells you that Weasley left because he wanted to be with friends who were more like him.

274
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:09,260
She tells you that next week you'll have a new visitor, a brand new friend who will be just as

275
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:22,420
nice as Weasley. You are not satisfied with that fucking answer. Bravo, don't fall for that

276
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:27,619
line of bull. Parents are great at fabricating stories like this when they make mistakes.

277
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:32,659
You will not get your Weasley Wabbit back, but your intelligence and perseverance in this

278
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:38,260
situation make it harder for your parents to tell you made-up stories to cover their mistakes.

279
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:47,059
How tall am I now? You're alone in the kitchen and begin exploring the closets

280
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:57,590
and refrigerator. Am I gonna like pull the refrigerator down? This could be bad. All right,

281
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:06,150
curious but cautious. Move toward the pantry. All right, adventuring, move toward pantry.

282
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:13,179
You swing the pantry door open and see all the beautifully colored jars, boxes, and bottles.

283
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,139
One jar looks particularly pretty. It is shiny and brown and full of liquid.

284
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:26,139
You unscrew the cap and smell what is inside. It smells sweet. No, I don't think I'm gonna drink

285
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:38,179
this. You've just avoided a potentially lethal accident. Your good judgment has saved your

286
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:50,380
life. You throw up at the pantry door. Jesus Christ. You're touching something smooth and

287
00:37:50,380 --> 00:38:01,539
shiny. You pat it with your hand a few times. What? It's like the mood. I'm confused. What is it?

288
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,840
I'm confused, but I'm gonna keep touching it. It's not hot, right? It's not like a stove.

289
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:14,860
It is flat and a little cool. Wait a minute. There's a baby in there. Who is that baby?

290
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:20,809
What? Oh, it's a mirror. It's me. No, that's someone else.

291
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:31,159
I don't know. I'm trying to make them like a weirdo. No, that's you. You are looking at

292
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:38,949
yourself in a mirror. Isn't that a beautiful baby? Yes. You really are quite stunning.

293
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:48,980
You are developing a positive self-image. All right, cool. It is announced to you

294
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,139
during a heart-to-heart talk that it's time for you to give up the bottle and

295
00:38:53,139 --> 00:39:04,500
drink from a glass like a big boy. No. How are you going to show your resistance?

296
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:18,920
Cry. Fold your arms and say no. Throw the bottle at mommy. No. A nice strong effort to

297
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,639
fight for what you believe in. Since you are strong enough to put up such a fuss,

298
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:32,840
you're also old enough to get off the bottle. We're gonna have to...

299
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,369
Yeah, I got baited there. We're gonna have to learn to live without it.

300
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:46,650
I'm not gonna suck my thumb. No. Learn to live without it. You'll be tough for a while.

301
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,369
You'll turn to Super Duck for comfort. Believe me, cold turkey is the best way to do it.

302
00:39:51,369 --> 00:40:02,119
Good luck. Super Duck a cartoon or something? You're a guest at your friend Billy's house.

303
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:12,789
His mom gives you both a box of crayons and two pieces of paper. Artistic. Draw on the paper.

304
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:19,579
Draw in general. You draw large circles and swirls with black crayon on the paper. Oops,

305
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:27,750
you drew on the expensive tablecloth. Tell Billy about the spot. Cover up the spot. Tell

306
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:38,570
Billy's mom about the spot. No. You casually slide the paper over the offending spot where

307
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:44,090
it will remain covered and undetected until after you leave. This was the sneaky cowardly

308
00:40:44,090 --> 00:41:02,920
way out. Cowardly and sneaky. I didn't do it. There was one time where I slept over a

309
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:13,610
friend's house and I slept on the couch and I was like, I don't know, maybe like 14 or

310
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:21,829
something, 13. I was old and I was like old. So in the middle of the night, I was like,

311
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:27,429
I was touching my face and touching my nose and touching the blanket that I had.

312
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:36,809
And the next morning after doing that a few times, I got up and realized that I had blood,

313
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:44,650
I had like a bloody nose. And then when I didn't even know. And it was like on the

314
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,650
blanket and I had like a fucking panic attack. I was like, Oh my God, they're

315
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,730
going to hate me. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? At first I like folded it up

316
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,369
a shit load of times and like put it in the corner and I was like, no, I can't do that.

317
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:57,610
I have to like, I know they're going to find it. They're going to know it's me.

318
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:11,750
Eventually, like I just told, I told my friend, I was like, Hey, did you do it?

319
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,989
I first tried it, but I put it on him. Did you have like a bloody nose when we were

320
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:26,300
sitting on like the couch? No, man. No. Oh, well, um, I, maybe I, it's on there.

321
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,099
It's not, wait, it is. Oh yeah. Yeah, there is. Okay. Was it you? I don't know. It may be one of

322
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:42,579
us. I'd have been me or you. It may have been you. May have been me or you. The coward way out.

323
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:50,090
Coward. I did say it was like, who knows? It could have been me. Like I was taking

324
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:54,090
blame for it. It was like, it was either like you or it was me. It was me or you.

325
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,300
It could have been either one of us. It was probably me. It was you. It could have been

326
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,699
either way. I did it in his mind. He knew, he knew he didn't have a bloody nose. So it

327
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:06,019
had to be me. So I gave him the opportunity to think maybe it was him, but it was me. So he

328
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:14,230
get, he knew it was me. I'm not the coward way. 34 by the way. I was, this didn't happen last

329
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:23,369
week. This happened like 20 fucking years ago. 34. Yeah. 34 by the way. This happened

330
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:35,320
last Saturday. All right. You are sitting in a large place and a furry man walks up to you.

331
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,369
He's walking around you in circles. A furry man.

332
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:06,329
I'm going to grab the furry man by the head.

333
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:18,809
Oh, no. God.

334
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,840
What?

335
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:03,699
What? This is toddler. No.

336
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,909
Inquisitive. Ask some questions. Which question would you like to ask?

337
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:22,150
Do you have a husband? Do you have a doggie? Mommy said that daddy has a thick skull. Do you?

338
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:31,139
I tried very hard to pinch a penny like Aunt Edna, but couldn't. Can you? Mommy said that

339
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:38,329
daddy has a thick skull. The lady giggles and mom puts her hand over your mouth and says,

340
00:45:39,659 --> 00:46:04,940
whack. What? Wait, did you actually get? What? Okay. This is mom. Jesus Christ. Mom is cheating.

341
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,820
Dad, where's dad? Perhaps you are interested in asking something else. Which question would

342
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:19,610
you like to ask? Do you have a doggie? She tells you no, no doggie, only a cat. You

343
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:30,219
inform her that daddy said that that's what they cook in the restaurant on the corner.

344
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:41,590
What? Where? What's why my parents so fucked? Perhaps you are interested in asking something

345
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:53,820
else. Do you have a husband? She tells you that she doesn't have a husband. You are

346
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,260
alone in your parents' bedroom. There is a shiny silver quarter on the table.

347
00:46:58,579 --> 00:47:06,630
Honest, dishonest, take the quarter. I'm gonna honestly take the quarter. You have made

348
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:14,340
an inappropriate response. What? What do you mean? It's not dishonest if I say I'm taking

349
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:21,940
this quarter out loud. It is really questionable as to whether a child your age can tell

350
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,900
whether something like this is truly right or wrong. You have a vague sense that you

351
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,840
shouldn't have picked it up. Your mother sees you stash something in your pocket.

352
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:37,719
She asks you what you have there. You say nothing or this and hold out the quarter.

353
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:49,099
This. You're not so dishonest. In fact, you are being very trustworthy. It was a

354
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:57,300
temptation you couldn't resist. You get a big hug for being honest after all. I told you

355
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:03,239
I honestly wanted to take it. Hey, we got some weaves and growth here. Daddy says it's

356
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:15,699
time to go to bed. Hmm. What time is it though? That's important. Is it seven o'clock,

357
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:24,099
eight o'clock? If it was like six o'clock, I'd say no. I probably would be tired. Tired,

358
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:30,469
but I don't want to go to bed. Dad tries to bribe you by offering a bedtime story.

359
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:37,059
Oh, fucking hell, yeah. You're so tired that the murmur of words puts you right to sleep.

360
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:40,739
You don't even remember what the story was about. That's a pretty good deal. Yeah.

361
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:48,090
I made out on that one. It's Saturday morning and Dad asks you to help with some chores.

362
00:48:48,650 --> 00:49:00,420
The Super Duck cartoon hour has just begun. I can't miss Super Duck. It's the best show on TV.

363
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:11,960
You're too busy fighting the glue monster with Super Duck. You're oblivious to all

364
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:17,449
sights and sounds other than the ones coming from the TV set. Dad tries to encourage you

365
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:25,239
away from the TV. Does it work? Of course it doesn't. You're becoming a TV addict at a very

366
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:30,760
young age. Before you know it, you will be staying up late watching old odd couple reruns.

367
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:41,699
So that's why that happened. I actually, I watch that show. I've seen every episode.

368
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:47,300
You're in a sandbox playing with your favorite toy. A larger, stronger child pulls it away from

369
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:57,179
you and screams, mine! What the fuck did you just do? Give it back. The child seems much

370
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:01,659
stronger than you. He puts three fingers in your mouth and tries to push you away.

371
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:10,789
He is holding the metal toy above your head. Bite him. The metal toy comes down right on your

372
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:18,550
head. No! Whoa! Crash again. Crash again. You are beginning to feel dizzy. You cry out, crash,

373
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:25,559
crash. He finally starts with your head and face uncovered in blood. His mother takes

374
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:30,199
him away before either one of your parents can tell what happened. He was a problem child

375
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:34,840
with very aggressive tendencies. He's done this to other children too. You were treated unfairly.

376
00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:49,099
He was smashing the... Did I get the toy back? You know, if I'm in the car right back with the

377
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:56,250
toy in my hands. Like slow zoom into my face with some fucking rock music playing. A little

378
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:05,539
smirk. Yeah. Time to feed the fish. You punch a small amount of fish food in between your

379
00:51:05,539 --> 00:51:11,980
fingers and tap on the glass. There is no sign of Gabriella. Who the fuck is Gabriella?

380
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:25,079
The fish? Unaffected. Do nothing. That's cold. Look for Gabriella. You put your hand in the

381
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:31,110
fish bowl and look for Gabriella. She is stuck under a rock. She is stiff and her eyes are

382
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:41,000
puffed out. You think that she might be sick. Oh god. Fucking god. I would... I'm not going

383
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,139
to take... No, I'm calling for mom on this scenario here. Gabby floats up to the surface

384
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:50,619
from under a big gray rock. Her eye seems very puffy and her body is stiff. You are

385
00:51:50,619 --> 00:52:00,179
relieved to see she hasn't jumped out of the bowl. Ask mom about Gabby. Mom stutters

386
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:04,900
through the answers to your questions. She's uncomfortable and sad. Mom explains that

387
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:12,809
Gabby can't swim anymore. She's dead. She's gone away. How can that be? She's right there.

388
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:19,139
What is dead? You wonder. You are confused. Mom says that Gabby has to be taken out of

389
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:38,170
the bowl. Why would you... What would you... Okay. If this is a child, why would you in front of

390
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:46,789
this kid flush this down the toilet? No. You do that like you keep her in a box and

391
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,989
you give her a little thing like, oh, say goodbye. You don't just like flush.

392
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:16,329
Keep her in a box. You really can't do that. Gabby will start to smell up the drawer. You

393
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:20,409
still don't understand what this is all about, but tomorrow you will start to miss the ritual

394
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:31,670
of feeding her. Oh. Keep her in a box in my drawer. I don't know. I'm trying to be nice.

395
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:39,610
No. The fish, you can flush that fish. Whatever. But to the child, you say some

396
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:43,210
things. You say, oh, we're going to like, we're going to have them go off and I'll take

397
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:51,179
them on their next journey. You don't just do that. You are in the back seat of the car

398
00:53:51,179 --> 00:54:01,179
during a very long ride. Tired. I'm just, I'm just like tired. I don't, I hate long car rides.

399
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:06,789
Let's just play a game so I can wake up here. You are too tired to play games. Are you feeling

400
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:11,980
less sleepy all of a sudden? Yes. Your mom has taken along some picture books and coloring

401
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:19,829
books for you to play with. What would you like to do? Let's just, let's just color.

402
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:24,469
Coloring is a solitary activity. You take the book and color in a picture of super duck.

403
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,469
You've missed an opportunity to have a positive social interaction with your mom.

404
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:32,329
Oh, fuck. I really am just like walking myself in here to like media.

405
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:40,329
Super duck is becoming more important than mom. Uh-oh. Danger ahead. You are eating

406
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:45,349
at the house of one of your parents' friends. You were told by your mother to be on your

407
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:51,449
best behavior. Something that you ate has disagreed with you and now you feel very sick.

408
00:54:51,449 --> 00:55:02,139
Queasy. Ignore it. Throw up and get it over with. Call mom. Try to find the bathroom yourself.

409
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:11,610
Throw up and get it. I think we just get it over with here. Throw up into the blankets

410
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:20,019
and fold them up. Find a bed first. Throw up and get it over with. Try to find the,

411
00:55:20,019 --> 00:55:27,110
all right, I'll try to find the bathroom. It is a large unfamiliar house. You find a

412
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:32,250
room, but it's not a bathroom. If you get sick here, no one will know.

413
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:37,800
Getting sick like that is difficult to hide. You are discovered and everyone feels sorry for you.

414
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,639
The person who has to clean it up feels less sorry for you than everyone else.

415
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:54,380
What? That's like kind of mean. You're still not completely familiar with using the toilet

416
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:59,340
that is still quite fascinating to you. You have just finished and you have cleaned yourself

417
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:13,420
like a big boy. Watch, watch the toilet paper disappear into the toilet. Make a boat out of

418
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:19,500
the toilet. Make a boat out of mom's brush and float it in the bowl. Ah, that sounds like fun.

419
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:27,610
Oops, it doesn't float. You can flush the bowl. Get it out with your hands. Flush it quick.

420
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:36,250
Woosh! It spins around three times and tries to go down the pipe. It goes halfway down.

421
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:41,610
The water slowly rises and spills out of the toilet. Mom rushes in. You stand there

422
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:45,769
looking at your mother with your index finger hooked into your bottom lip.

423
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,969
The cutesy routine doesn't work. You are sent directly to your room.

424
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,369
Today is dad's birthday and you would like to make him breakfast.

425
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:09,909
Extravagant. Let's make an extravagant eggs spread. What kind of eggs do you want to try?

426
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:15,320
Scrambled? Fried? Fried eggs. You must think that young children can do a lot.

427
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,480
The best you can do is throw them in a pot raw and give them to dad,

428
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:33,210
which is exactly what you do. He is in bed sleeping. Feed him raw eggs with a spoon.

429
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:38,380
Boy, is he surprised. He probably thinks this is going to be the best birthday ever.

430
00:57:39,019 --> 00:57:50,260
Mom is laughing very hard. Dad's egg is dripping on the bed. The phone rings while daddy is

431
00:57:50,260 --> 00:58:00,860
ironing a shirt. He must leave you alone in the room with the iron. Helpful. Help dad iron

432
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:10,019
the shirt. Don't die here. Don't die. I'm not going to die here. Cautious. Play quietly.

433
00:58:11,539 --> 00:58:15,300
Dad realizes that you are alone with the hot iron and calls you into him.

434
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,489
You run into the room and trip over the iron cord. The iron cord falls on the floor and

435
00:58:20,489 --> 00:58:24,650
burns a hole in the carpet. It is not your fault. Okay, I thought we were getting baited

436
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:33,989
there. I thought it was gonna like hit me in the head or something. All right, we're good.

437
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,380
Dad must get his teeth fixed and you must go with him to the dentist.

438
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:44,869
Mom is busy at work and dad couldn't find a sitter. You sit in the waiting room for a very

439
00:58:44,869 --> 00:58:52,119
very very long time. Dad must run out and put money in the parking meter. Dad sits you

440
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:55,800
on the floor, gives you a magazine to leaf through, and tells you to behave.

441
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:06,579
Remove your shoes. I don't know why that's funny.

442
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:13,380
Now you're feeling a bit more comfortable. A nosy lady spies you from the corner of her eye.

443
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,619
What's she looking at? Your sock is crooked.

444
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:26,739
A mischievous good boy. Ignore the sock and tear pages from the magazine.

445
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:32,119
Remove the sock. Funny thing about socks, the way they stretch all the way out before

446
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:39,179
they snap off your feet. You decide to take both of them off. The lady looks at you again.

447
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:51,820
Where's dad? Climb up on the chair and look out the window. Dad is on his way back in.

448
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:57,500
He sees you with no socks and shoes on and feels embarrassed. The busy body lady gives

449
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:10,309
him a full report. Walk over and stick your tongue out at her. You give her your worst face

450
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:14,789
and get whacked on the bottom lightly by your dad who secretly approves of what you did.

451
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:20,869
He buys you a big ice cream when you leave to make up for feeling guilty about patting you

452
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:33,659
on the rear. Think about babies and how we just socially accept babies because of the weird

453
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:37,179
crazy shit they do. Imagine you went into the dentist office and you're in the waiting room

454
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:42,579
and there's like just people there reading magazines. People are getting called in and

455
01:00:42,579 --> 01:00:47,659
you just take off your shoes and your socks and just like sit around and like start crawling on

456
01:00:47,659 --> 01:01:12,650
the chair. That's a Chad move. Why? You have just passed through infancy. I've been an infant

457
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:19,960
that whole time. A brief look at your life up to this time shows the following. Your family

458
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:25,940
life has been positive and nurturing and as a result you have begun to form the critical bonds

459
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:31,820
that are important during this phase of life. Physically you have been not a very healthy baby.

460
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:38,789
Socially oh this is a long list. Socially during this phase in life nothing much is really

461
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:44,150
expected of you. After all you're still much too young to throw a successful cocktail party

462
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:49,110
and frankly anyone who still dribbles on himself probably wouldn't make the ideal dinner

463
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:56,150
guest. However by now there are some things you should have mastered. Your progress in this area

464
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:03,380
shows you've been the type of child who charms the lollipops off people. You've been the type

465
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:10,659
of child who is huggable and gets his cheeks pinched by old ladies with bright red lipstick.

466
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:16,869
Now regarding your emotional and personality development. I'm doing pretty well. You're not

467
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:20,630
exactly the type of child who could be trusted to wash his hands before coming to the dinner

468
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:26,139
table. If there is a piece of cake sitting in the refrigerator at noon chances are it will be

469
01:02:26,139 --> 01:02:33,659
in your tummy by dinner. What's wrong with that? I'm fine. Your thoughtfulness your thoughtfulness

470
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:38,780
characteristic really doesn't count for much in this one module. Most children often find

471
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:43,579
themselves at the mercy of their whims and impulses. You're allowed to be cranky now.

472
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:50,380
People will tolerate it much better than when you are a teenager. Then your whining and carrying

473
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:56,539
on will seem more objectionable. One thing about your character that has a tendency to put people

474
01:02:56,539 --> 01:03:01,989
off is your aggressiveness. You are the type of baby who likes to pull on loose pieces of clothing,

475
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:07,750
hair, and any bulbous fleshy object that comes within your reach. You are going to have to

476
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:14,090
learn the meaning of make nice. That wraps up your status for the first module. I hope you

477
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:19,050
like yourself. If not you can always try to improve yourself in the modules to come. There's

478
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:32,539
I'm now a kid. Are we gonna try to make it all the way through this? We're gonna try to actually

479
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:42,789
get all the way through. Welcome to childhood. I wonder how many more opportunities there are to

480
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:58,860
like die. Well let's at least get through childhood. I need a redemption arc. Practice

481
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:12,949
yourself for heaven's sake in little things and thence proceed to greater. I'm now a child.

482
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:17,530
Mom has just taken a job that requires her to be away in the morning and early afternoon.

483
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:23,260
She decides to enroll you in a nursery school program. Upon your arrival you are greeted by

484
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:28,780
another lady with very skinny legs and large round glasses. There are children playing with

485
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:33,420
buckets of sand, building blocks, and other activities. There's a small boy sitting in a

486
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,579
corner with tears streaming from his eyes, a runny nose, and cheeks red from crying.

487
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:51,429
Excited. Walk over and try to make friends. Give the lady with the skinny legs a left hook.

488
01:04:55,460 --> 01:05:02,679
But why punch? No I need to stop my like psycho tendency. Walk over and try to make friends.

489
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:09,050
Your excitement is a positive sign that you are trying to adapt to this new environment.

490
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:13,050
To realize that your mom will be coming back so you attempt to make friends.

491
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:18,170
You see a little boy your age playing in the sand with trucks. What would you like to say to

492
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:26,179
him? Hi. Can I play? The little boy interrupts this as a threat. He interprets this as a

493
01:05:26,179 --> 01:05:35,130
threat to his territory. He holds the truck close to his body. You can ignore him. Ask

494
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:39,769
him to play. Let's play! The boy shakes his head back and forth. He wants no part of you.

495
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:51,159
What the fuck? I can't even play with some friends? Should have left hooked.

496
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:55,030
Your mom is in the bathtub taking a nice relaxing bath. You are playing quietly in

497
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,389
your room. All of a sudden the doorbell rings. Mom doesn't seem to hear it.

498
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:11,829
Hmm nonchalant. Open the door nonchalantly. Don't open the door. All grown up,

499
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:17,300
tell mom. You can't be that grown up if you have to rely on mom to answer the doorbell all

500
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:29,619
the time. This set of choices doesn't make too much sense. Why? I can't. So you want to be

501
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:38,619
just to go oh go open the door to a stranger when my mom's in the bathtub? You have been

502
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:42,780
invited to sleep over at your best friend's house. This is your first sleep away experience.

503
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:48,780
Reluctance, excitement, mixed feelings. Lie to your friend and tell him you are not allowed.

504
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:54,059
Ask your parents that they will still be there when you get back. What? Go to your friend's

505
01:06:54,059 --> 01:07:09,909
house as soon as possible. Mixed feelings. Mixed feelings but let's go. One way of resolving

506
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:14,710
a mixed feeling is to plunge headlong into a risky situation. Although risk taking is

507
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:19,769
sometimes a sign of emotional maturity, it can be dangerous if you do not take the time

508
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:25,940
to consider the possible consequences. While you are over at your friend's house,

509
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:38,360
you become frightened and demand to be taken home at two in the morning. Oh my god. I'm starting

510
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:47,079
to get a little soft here. While you are playing quietly in your room, you are strand- you're

511
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:55,719
strand-led, startled by loud muffled sounds coming from someplace else. It seems that your

512
01:07:55,719 --> 01:08:00,679
parents are having a terrible fight over something. Your father's deep voice seems to be shaking

513
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:07,820
the whole house. Your mother's piercing screams sound like she's being hurt terribly. What?

514
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:21,829
The yelling gets louder and louder then suddenly everything is quiet. When you see your parents,

515
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:26,069
later they act as if nothing has happened. Mom's hair is ruffled and she seems to be very

516
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:35,210
tired. You can't seem to figure out what has happened or can you? Oh they were having sex.

517
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:49,829
Right. I don't know. It was like I looked over here and we're getting like a lot of

518
01:08:50,149 --> 01:08:55,989
s's. It was like fucking screaming and fear. I don't know. Soon after you sit down for dinner,

519
01:08:55,989 --> 01:09:07,739
your mother announces that the vegetable of the day is Brussels sprouts. Disgust. Eat the

520
01:09:07,739 --> 01:09:11,579
Brussels sprouts without protest. Run screaming from the table. Put your finger in your mouth

521
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:25,720
and make a gagging sound. Feed the sprouts to your dog. Gudu. Gudu? Gudow? Gudow? Gudow.

522
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:36,380
Can dogs eat Brussels sprouts? Somebody look it up. Look up like can I feed? Can dogs eat

523
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:50,340
Brussels sprouts? It's important. I would look that up first. That's like not. Is that okay

524
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:57,720
for dogs? I'm a dog. I can confirm. Okay. All right. They can but not huge amounts. Okay.

525
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:05,060
So they'll be like it was only like two on there. That's not very fair is it? You resented

526
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:10,729
having to eat the sprouts yet you forced them on poor old Gudu. Poor Gudu thinks you are

527
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:14,810
doing him a favor. He will also think he's doing you a favor when he sleeps in your room later

528
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:34,779
tonight. Releasing the gaseous byproducts of his meal for your... of... An exciting movie is on

529
01:10:34,779 --> 01:10:39,340
television. The whole family is in the living room watching it. You get up to get a drink

530
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:46,100
of water and return to find all the good seeds have been taken. Defeated. Sit down quietly in

531
01:10:46,100 --> 01:11:00,649
a corner. Tell mom the doorbell is ringing. Tell dad the doorbell is ringing. You know

532
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:07,720
I'm to be devious here because I had uncles of mine. I'd go over family functions and I'd be

533
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:14,229
sitting in a nice comfortable chair and they would come over with a cordless phone in their

534
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:20,949
hand and they would have the button pressed. I was like probably 28 and they would have the

535
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:25,829
button pressed to show that the power was on on the phone and they would say hey it's it's

536
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:28,789
grandma. Can you talk to grandma? Like passing the phone around for grandma. Just like get up

537
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:31,909
just like go in the other room and like talk in there and people would fall for it all the time

538
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:41,909
and it was like it was the the red power indicator was on the phone like it had to be real

539
01:11:41,909 --> 01:11:51,819
and by the way I wasn't 28 19 or something I don't know. She falls for it. She rustles to

540
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:57,369
the door and then you jump on her seat. When she realizes what you have done she goes over

541
01:11:57,369 --> 01:12:06,279
and sits on top of dad. Everyone seems a bit happier now. Look at that. Look at what I've

542
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:14,149
done. You arrive at the dentist and discover that you have four rather large cavities that

543
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:29,560
need to be filled. Block out the sensations with your mind. I'm gonna be brave and I'm gonna block

544
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:37,560
it out. Your status sheet suggests that emotionally you are not capable of performing such a feat.

545
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:43,479
The pain sneaks into your consciousness but is not unbearable. This experience will toughen

546
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:50,939
you for next time. I still did it. I powered through it. I failed the stat check but it's

547
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:57,130
alright. Still got it. Why would I how could I die there? What's the death scenario there?

548
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:02,569
Your dad has promised that he will fix your bicycle. He's taking a nap so he's not doing

549
01:13:02,569 --> 01:13:13,210
anything. Now seems like a good time to remind him. Patient and sweet. Tap dad on the shoulder.

550
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:22,789
Make the TV loud so he wakes up. I would say put the TV loud and then run out of the room.

551
01:13:22,789 --> 01:13:27,939
You know slowly put that volume up to a point where it's not ridiculous but it will

552
01:13:27,939 --> 01:13:31,979
definitely wake them up and then put the changer down and leave the room and then

553
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:36,539
you'll wait for them to get up and wait like I don't know maybe two to three minutes

554
01:13:36,539 --> 01:13:41,420
after you hear them wake up and then like have a jacket on right have like a little jacket on

555
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:52,600
and walk in the room unzipping the jacket oh hey it worked now that you've got his attention

556
01:13:52,600 --> 01:14:00,229
look at how wide his eyes are open you can say something to him leave him alone yeah let's

557
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:08,199
just hey you said you're gonna fix my bike um dad would you fix my bike dad would you fix

558
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:14,859
my bike now no no no dad would you fix my bike not now then we're not gonna command it

559
01:14:16,069 --> 01:14:20,630
even though you seem helpless dad just rolls over and falls back asleep he mumbles

560
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:35,159

569
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:58,970
while rummaging around in the kitchen drawer you come across a book of matches

570
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:09,319

572
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:31,779
this is bad you are mesmerized oh you are mesmerized by the spark and flash of the

573
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:36,340
match as you strike it you let the flame burn down the shaft of the match then blow it out

574
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:40,340
and light another no i didn't say another one the kitchen air soon becomes smoky with a

575
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:45,060
pungent sulfur odor the smoke alarm rings and sends your mother scurrying to check

576
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:54,100
what's happening you are grounded for a week take them back to your room is definitely a

577
01:16:54,100 --> 01:17:02,380
death scenario you are in school and the teacher is giving a boring lecture the boy sitting two

578
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:07,340
seats away is rolling up a piece of paper and putting it in his mouth using the barrel of

579
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:15,300
his pen he spits the paper at the blackboard where it lands with a wet the teacher is furious

580
01:17:15,859 --> 01:17:22,500
she screams who did this everyone in the class is howling until she promises that if the person

581
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:28,579
who did this will not come forward the whole class will get a punishment you are probably

582
01:17:28,579 --> 01:17:40,869
the only person who saw the true culprit the teacher acknowledges you you can um may it please

583
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:48,949
be excused say pointing he was the one who did it a hush falls over the class some of

584
01:17:48,949 --> 01:17:53,909
the other children's sigh and relief some snicker your anxiety makes you look a little

585
01:17:53,909 --> 01:18:12,390
nerdish but everyone is thankful i'm taking charge okay i'm taking charge of that scenario

586
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:15,750
at school all of your friends are talking about a television program that you could not

587
01:18:15,829 --> 01:18:22,899
stay up to watch a friend asks if you saw it unashamed say i didn't watch that show say i

588
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:26,920
wasn't allowed to see it say yeah i watched it it was really great yeah that's what i would do

589
01:18:28,949 --> 01:18:37,739
i used to do shit like that all the time you're a confident liar your status sheet suggests

590
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:42,300
this is becoming a strong part of your personality for now your dishonesty remains

591
01:18:42,300 --> 01:19:03,289
undetected actually becoming the real me late late lie and lazy the triple l and a snitch

592
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:16,359
you've just been ordered to bed by your parents in the middle of a favorite television show

593
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,680
angry complain about having to go to bed beg for 10 more minutes

594
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:26,140
yeah i would say 10 more minutes the show is almost over and if they said no

595
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:32,539
then i would just take a small tv into my bedroom plug it in and put it under the covers and watch

596
01:19:32,539 --> 01:19:37,829
the show and the second that i heard the of my parents coming towards the door i would fucking

597
01:19:37,829 --> 01:19:41,060
turn the tv off and pretend i was asleep and they would open the door and check

598
01:19:41,779 --> 01:19:49,140
begging makes your parents feel guilty they let you stay up 10 more minutes after 10 minutes

599
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:53,859
they forgot you are supposed to go to bed and let you stay up for another hour before anyone

it dad dad shows you the old foot in the door technique at mrs marcus's house this technique

613
01:21:55,050 --> 01:22:01,449

614
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:08,789
removes the front of dad's sneaker what the foot in the door tech would just open somebody's door

615
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:15,239
say that was pretty good but you can only do it twice say maybe it's time to wrap it up for

616
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:24,010
today but even you can only do it twice maybe it's time to wrap it up for today oh because

sharply this man hurts children jesus christ why would you ever select the other options

630
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,260
you've just turned off the television set and your room is pitch dark through the shadows

631
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:23,560
you notice that your closet doors open just a crack you can almost see the image of a

632
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:28,840
black hooded axe murderer squinting at you through the door he's waiting waiting for

633
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:34,550
you to close your eyes and fall asleep in the quiet of the night you can hear his

634
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:40,310
hoarse breath making deep gurgling sounds you look away from the door and look back

635
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:48,840
it's open a bit farther than it was the last time if you can only make it to the closet

636
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:53,159
and shut the door tight you know he won't be able to get out and murder you in your sleep

637
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:59,720
the morning light will destroy him so you won't have to worry about seeing him when you wake up

afraid calm pull the covers over your head get help sneak out of the bed

639
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:19,779

640
01:25:19,779 --> 01:25:25,060
at how stupid you are for falling right into his deadly trap you'll show him you

641
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:29,060
lunge toward the closet door tripping over the leg of the bed and pulling the bed linens

642
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:35,880
down on top of you ha you've done it the closet is closed you can finally settle down into a

665
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:35,210

to believe but you have seen wild kingdom enough times to know that anything is possible

776

you confront your mother with the information as you remember hearing it your choice for a

777
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:10,939
leisurely topic of conversation catches mom off guard later you have a nice discussion

778
01:44:10,939 --> 01:44:17,020
about how babies are born she stresses the love aspect but neglects to tell you that

994
02:19:17,379 --> 02:19:30,200
idea of getting drunk i would be anxious about this i don't know i don't know i don't i do i

995
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:43,190
wouldn't do that i didn't do that no no no most of your friends are probably doing the

996
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:47,989
same thing that's probably why it is taking three hours to finish 12 ounces of wine

997
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:56,379
after the wine is finally finished you can sit back and watch everyone or do something silly

998
02:20:02,180 --> 02:20:21,299
ride your bike into a tree wait what why would you no oh pull your pants down

1001
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:48,649

1002
02:20:48,729 --> 02:21:04,649
it i didn't i pretended i didn't drink anything what you're usually not as impulsive as this so

1003
02:21:04,649 --> 02:21:08,090
i guess a little silliness won't hurt this experience does nothing negative to you

1004
02:21:08,729 --> 02:21:21,940

this kind of experience right now intellectual and physical spheres rise there we go early in

1068
02:32:01,799 --> 02:32:06,760
the evening a friend's mother appears mysteriously at the door and asks to speak to your mother

1069
02:32:08,420 --> 02:32:13,059
from another room you hear the woman say that you have been a bad influence on her son

1070
02:32:13,059 --> 02:32:18,819
and that your mother should try harder to raise you the right way her complaints by the

1071
02:32:19,139 --> 02:32:25,530
are totally unjustified first you barely know her son and second he is the biggest juvenile

1072
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:39,059
delinquent in town without your help or anyone else's uh that's bullshit i can understand why

1073
02:32:39,059 --> 02:32:42,819
you were angry but going in and giving the woman a piece of your mind proves her point to

1074
02:32:42,819 --> 02:32:47,219
her here you are storming in from another room acting rude in front of the company

1075
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:52,579
you try to convince the wrong person of your innocence for better success you should have

1076
02:32:52,579 --> 02:33:22,760
concentrated on your mom what are you doing i'm just this is not even me you have just mastered

1077
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:27,319
mustered up the courage to ask faith morgan voted hottest bod of the century

1079
02:33:43,030 --> 02:33:47,350

1080
02:33:48,229 --> 02:33:52,100
um

1081
02:33:52,100 --> 02:34:05,260
flapable a depressed middle finger angry middle finger save it she already thinks you are a jerk

1082
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:09,819
why etch the impression of yourself as a boorish slob any deeper into her mind

1083
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:24,500
unflappably walk you're currently madly in love with a girl who is having a birthday next

1084
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:29,459
week you're trying to think of what to get her she's hinted about a very expensive piece

1085
02:34:29,459 --> 02:34:36,889
of jewelry that would just about wipe out your life savings if you choose to buy it for her no

1086
02:34:38,620 --> 02:34:44,969
no i would i would think about it for a second no you're trying to think of something else but

1087
02:34:44,969 --> 02:34:49,129
your guilt prevents you from coming up with anything good eventually the whole experience

1088
02:34:49,129 --> 02:35:01,219
makes you resent the girl and the relationship flops this is like falling apart some more

1089
02:35:01,219 --> 02:35:09,479
sexual matters while sitting around the house with a girlfriend how many girlfriends do i have

1090
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:20,059
she says she wants to give you a manicure appreciative yeah whatever that's fine

1091
02:35:22,329 --> 02:35:26,649
letting your friend groom you puts her in a very romantic mood after she finishes the job

1092
02:35:26,649 --> 02:35:31,850
you get cozy on the couch and have a hot and heavy time unfortunately the next day your friends

1093
02:35:31,850 --> 02:35:43,299

they know your dad's boss thinks that you're a fine young man he would be honored if you

1095
02:35:55,879 --> 02:36:00,680

1096
02:36:08,069 --> 02:36:17,110
another girl all right yeah let's do it this was a very open-minded set of choices

1097
02:36:17,110 --> 02:36:23,110
you arrive at the country club waiting to meet dad's boss's daughter all of a sudden this

1098
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:28,870
movie star walks up to you your eyes glaze your mouth gets dry and you must concentrate

1099
02:36:28,870 --> 02:36:33,430
very hard to prevent your tongue from dropping out of your mouth could this be

1100
02:36:33,430 --> 02:36:41,450
matilda nope it's some lady who thinks you work there parking cars matilda arrives complete

1101
02:36:41,450 --> 02:36:47,700
with braces pigtails and a squeaky laugh as the night goes on you find out she's not so

1102
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:57,940
bad dad gets a raise the following week now about the company picnic next month all right

1103
02:36:59,850 --> 02:37:09,610

1104
02:37:09,610 --> 02:37:15,100
you to do all the things you think you would like to do at least he suggests careers that

1105
02:37:15,100 --> 02:37:20,139
you couldn't see yourself doing in a million years he talked about colleges that seem dull

1106
02:37:20,139 --> 02:37:25,340
and uninteresting say son have you ever thought of going to a military college

1107
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:30,420
you get the distinct sense that he has already planned the next eight years of your

1108
02:37:30,420 --> 02:37:35,219
life for you at this point you may not be sure that you want to go to college at all

1109

calm and i'm not calm i'm not a calm person i'm not calm you're letting your father overstep

1110
02:37:59,100 --> 02:38:03,899
his bounds as advisor his concern about your getting a good education has caused him to

1111
02:38:03,899 --> 02:38:09,979
behave in an overly controlling fashion you're evidently too anxious to confront him about

1112
02:38:09,979 --> 02:38:14,700
this so he continues making decisions for you keeping you not only anxious and depressed

1113
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:28,329
but dependent on him as well but oh an ad in the paper says wanted young adults 15 to 20 for

1174
02:46:46,459 --> 02:46:50,620
unfortunately there is no way to help people like this denial is one of the strongest

1175
02:46:50,620 --> 02:46:56,940
defenses alcoholics have on their side he's like 12 if he ever chooses to get straightened

1188
02:49:23,909 --> 02:49:36,920
did i get soft-locked you are in a quiet pensive mood and your thoughts turn to subject

1189
02:49:36,920 --> 02:49:41,639
of religion your family's beliefs seem out of step with your own as you wonder about the

1190
02:49:41,639 --> 02:49:45,940
nature of your existence would they understand if you told them about the differences

1191
02:49:51,209 --> 02:49:58,969
uh i guess well i guess we're going to confront the family talk about well different stuff you

1192
02:49:58,969 --> 02:50:03,209
desire to question the meaning of religion faith and some of life's larger more philosophical

1193
02:50:03,209 --> 02:50:08,969
questions is admirable this kind of independent thinking stimulates the mind and fuels divergent

1194
02:50:08,969 --> 02:50:16,250
thought your parents can't accept your views they say you are all wrong it doesn't even

1195
02:50:16,250 --> 02:50:21,540
seem as if they are listening to what you are saying you think they accept too much of their

1196
02:50:21,540 --> 02:50:26,780
religion on faith you are quick to point out several elements of the religion that seem

1197
02:50:26,780 --> 02:50:31,959
hypocritical because your family relationships have been strained in the past they are

1198
02:50:31,959 --> 02:50:45,940
reluctant to accept you as an independent free-thinking person what the fuck while you

1199
02:50:45,940 --> 02:50:49,780
are shopping in town one day a woman who introduces herself as a photographer tells you

1200
02:50:49,780 --> 02:50:53,780
that you are very handsome and that she might be able to get some modeling work for you she

1201
02:50:53,780 --> 02:50:58,709
gives you her card is this going to be another scenario where it's an empty apartment with his

1202
02:50:58,709 --> 02:51:04,860
phone let's okay let's do it the woman tells you that she has just been given an assignment

1203
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:09,420
to shoot some models for a famous men's underwear manufacturer would you be willing

1204
02:51:09,420 --> 02:51:18,069
to pose for some pictures the pay is five hundred dollars that's the no wait how old am

1205
02:51:18,069 --> 02:51:29,690
i no no no no no no too bad she tells you she will call if anything else comes up it

1206
02:51:29,690 --> 02:51:46,700
doesn't i must be employed was that did that count as employment your best friend since

1207
02:51:46,700 --> 02:51:50,780
grade school has been looking depressed and is confused he is usually a very happy-go-lucky

1208
02:51:50,780 --> 02:51:58,379
person so you really can't understand what could be wrong uh ask him what's wrong he tells

1209
02:51:58,379 --> 02:52:05,659
you that there's nothing wrong but you can see by his face that he is deeply troubled no no

1210
02:52:05,659 --> 02:52:16,709
no no no keep uh leave him alone i guess you believe that i guess you believe you have tried

1211
02:52:16,709 --> 02:52:21,670
and that any further prying would be inappropriate some people have a way of testing whether a person

1212
02:52:21,670 --> 02:52:27,020
truly wants to help as opposed to those who merely feel it is their obligation to be friends

1213
02:52:27,020 --> 02:52:31,340
by saying that there really isn't anything wrong i think that this was one of those times you

1214
02:52:31,340 --> 02:52:44,260
never find out what was bothering him you're shopping at a drug store it is almost closing

1215
02:52:44,260 --> 02:52:49,059
time the manager is letting the customers out one by one keeping the door locked so no one

1216
02:52:49,059 --> 02:52:54,360
else can come in suddenly the man in front of you at the cast register takes out a gun

1217
02:52:54,360 --> 02:52:59,000
and announces a hold-up he smells heavily of alcohol and it looks like if the gun could be

1218
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:31,290
fake could be could be i don't know that for sure uh-oh you move solely on instinct you

1219
02:53:31,290 --> 02:53:35,860
attempt to wrestle the gun from his hand as you thought it is a fake he is easily subdued

1220
02:53:35,860 --> 02:53:44,629
you acted bravely but impulsively i just fucking like karate chopped his i swung as hard as i

1221
02:53:44,629 --> 02:53:50,229
could down on the hand he was pointing just put all my weight karate fucking smashed down

saying since you have no pictures or direct evidence he tells you there's nothing i can do

1233
02:55:43,030 --> 02:55:47,510

besides your date seems to be so engrossed in the movie she doesn't seem to mind either

03:04:38,899 --> 03:04:58,309
time and place and ann accepts it was worth a shot go on a date

1295
03:05:01,979 --> 03:05:07,420
ann has just won an all-expense paid trip for two to a fantastic ski resort in vermont

1296
03:05:07,420 --> 03:05:10,979
she has invited you to go along with her there's only one problem

1297
03:05:11,700 --> 03:05:16,500
ann's parents absolutely refuse to allow their daughter to take an overnight trip with any one

1298
03:05:16,500 --> 03:05:22,540
of the opposite sex what will you do convince ann that she should tell her parents that she

1299
03:05:22,540 --> 03:05:27,979
is going with someone else convince and to stick up for herself i have a talk with ann's parents

1301
03:05:37,030 --> 03:05:45,110
i'll talk to you parents you've decided to confront them honestly ann's dad appreciates

1302
03:05:45,110 --> 03:05:50,149
this he answers you with the same honesty he doesn't trust you alone in the same room with

1303
03:05:50,149 --> 03:05:55,860
his daughter he thinks the two of you will have sex you mentioned that if you wanted

1304
03:05:55,860 --> 03:06:00,340
to have sex with his daughter it would be much easier to go someplace closer to home

1305
03:06:00,340 --> 03:06:06,010
like a local motel you are proud of yourself for winning points in the logic department

1306
03:06:07,450 --> 03:06:21,219
holy shit the second that sentence ends chair scraping against floor stands up fucking straight

1307
03:06:21,219 --> 03:06:37,959
what the fuck did you just say that's as what i would imagine and dad says very true very

1308
03:06:37,959 --> 03:06:44,309
true then gets a very sinister look on his face and continues just about the only difference

1309
03:06:44,309 --> 03:06:50,459
my friend is that you did something like that close to home and i found out about it

1310
03:06:50,459 --> 03:06:55,500
i would not be inconvenienced by having to travel far to find you and beat you to a pulp

1311
03:06:59,139 --> 03:07:12,889
okay did we get to go you and ann are both thinking through your decisions about going

1312
03:07:12,889 --> 03:07:19,049
to college and wants to go to a college that has a strong pre veterinary program there are

1313
03:07:19,129 --> 03:07:25,350
none in the area making that college would mean that she would need to travel a great distance

1314
03:07:25,350 --> 03:07:30,489
you wouldn't see each other for a long period of time long periods of time which one of these

1315
03:07:30,489 --> 03:07:46,549
things reflects your feelings on this don't pervert wait wait what if i okay i guess

1316
03:07:49,159 --> 03:07:56,020
it seems as though you are trying to avoid your real feelings there is hesitation and

1317
03:07:56,020 --> 03:08:01,059
confusion that you're not owning up to how good could anyone feel after his girlfriend

1318
03:08:01,059 --> 03:08:05,139
has just said she is leaving to go far away for a relatively long period of time

1319
03:08:31,129 --> 03:08:35,690
and has spent the afternoon with her parents visiting friends of the family when you see

1320
03:08:35,690 --> 03:08:45,979
ann she can't stop talking about john their son when ann and john were younger everyone

1321
03:08:45,979 --> 03:08:54,250
joked about how nice it would be if they married when they got older isn't that cute

1322
03:08:54,250 --> 03:08:57,129
anyway ann goes on to tell you that john grew up to be an absolute

1323
03:08:58,090 --> 03:09:04,010
hunk with the cutest set of dimples on his cheeks after she finishes her detailed description she

1324
03:09:04,010 --> 03:09:09,209
squeals he looked just like one of those calendar models i could have died how do you

1325
03:09:09,209 --> 03:09:31,620
feel about this i don't know i uh i'm a bit threatened by this i guess that's understandable

1326
03:09:31,620 --> 03:09:37,639
from what i understand of ann she's not the most trustworthy type i know that's difficult

1327
03:09:37,639 --> 03:09:42,280
to hear but it was one of her characteristics when you met her earlier you should examine

1328
03:09:42,360 --> 03:09:48,170
why you would want to stay with someone who you might not trust is it just you being overly

1329
03:09:48,170 --> 03:09:52,250
concerned or is there really a danger that she might abandon you for the first gorgeous

1330
03:09:52,250 --> 03:10:05,139
available guy that comes along even though you have chosen to break it off the relationship

03:17:46,940 --> 03:17:53,260
on having an affair with no what then i can only assume that you made an unconscious error by

1380
03:17:53,260 --> 03:17:58,459
choosing this option a Freudian slip of the interface so to speak i must interpret this as

1381
03:17:58,459 --> 03:18:01,899
a sign that you never wanted to go to the prom with your steady girlfriend in the first

1382
03:18:01,899 --> 03:18:07,739
place which means your relationship is on the skips no what the excitement of the prom causes

1383
03:18:07,739 --> 03:18:13,020
stress which destroys your relationship before prom night even arrives you fail to find another

1478
03:33:04,090 --> 03:33:08,170
a word he is saying but everyone else seems to be nodding and following along what will you

1479
03:33:08,170 --> 03:33:17,659
do why don't you stop like stop him and ask for clarification your teacher is impressed

1480
03:33:17,659 --> 03:33:21,180
by the fact that you thought enough of the subject matter to ask him to explain it so

1481
03:33:21,180 --> 03:33:27,510
that you fully understand his explanation makes it almost bearable almost barely understandable

1482
03:33:27,510 --> 03:33:34,790
but at least that's enough to get you through the next quiz he even gives you a few live

1483
03:33:34,790 --> 03:33:48,420
souvenirs to take home and study on your own what do you do with the souvenirs put them

period of time i well i said i was gonna i said i was gonna do it i'm gonna do it

03:37:39,770 --> 03:37:43,690
that you absolutely cannot learn at about two o'clock in the morning you begin to see how

1510
03:37:43,690 --> 03:37:52,149
easy it would be to write the formula on your hand and cheat no you always get caught that way

1511
03:37:52,149 --> 03:37:57,659
that's just evidence the more you try the more you are frustrated at 4 a.m you finally

1512
03:37:57,659 --> 03:38:01,659
doze off to sleep the next day when you sit down to take the test you find out that the

1513
03:38:01,659 --> 03:38:10,120
formula you couldn't learn was not included on the test you got an a all right all right

1516
03:38:35,819 --> 03:38:40,940
naked even though you try not to look you can't help wondering about how you measure up to

1517
03:38:40,940 --> 03:39:01,590
the other guys this is an unusually calm response what is with this sexual high school

1518
03:39:01,590 --> 03:39:09,590
shit mr hummer your math teacher is a 26 year old knockup oh miss hummer she puts

1519
03:39:09,670 --> 03:39:15,430
any girl in the school to shame one year on a class trip to the beach she wore a bikini

1520
03:39:15,430 --> 03:39:20,229
joey brant took pictures of her and sold them around school for five dollars each what the

1521
03:39:20,229 --> 03:39:24,950
fuck you raise your hand to ask her a question she slinks over to you and leans forward to

1522
03:39:24,950 --> 03:39:38,139
answer your question after she helps you she walks past and brushes her hip against the

1523
03:39:38,139 --> 03:39:51,209
desk where your hand is when you see your friends later you i don't say anything oh god

1524
03:39:51,209 --> 03:39:56,329
who would believe that you got the besides mr hummer is engaged to a linebacker for the

1525
03:39:56,329 --> 03:40:06,020
ala rams you certainly wouldn't want him to think you got you have just passed through

1526
03:40:06,020 --> 03:40:14,360
adolescence we did it i made it from infancy childhood adolescence i only like i broke my

1527
03:40:14,360 --> 03:40:20,250
neck once i landed once on my head out of from a rock and that's it everything else is

1528
03:40:20,250 --> 03:40:27,700
good family life can be very rough during adolescence even though your family expects

1529
03:40:27,700 --> 03:40:33,420
you to take charge of your life no one wants to let you have the freedom to do what you want

1530
03:40:33,420 --> 03:40:37,500
judging by your progress through life so far your family life has not been very good

1531
03:40:38,059 --> 03:40:43,500
spending time at home is like going to battle at times you aren't sure how you can even

1532
03:40:43,500 --> 03:40:49,319
live there physically you have been not very healthy socially this phase of life does present

1533
03:40:49,319 --> 03:40:54,940
its share of problems most of these problems fall into the category of girls life must have

1534
03:40:54,940 --> 03:41:02,649
been pretty simple before they showed up yeah your social adjustments to this phase of life

1535
03:41:02,649 --> 03:41:09,819
has been remarkable although you do not have a steady girlfriend at the present time there's

1536
03:41:09,819 --> 03:41:16,440
always the next life phase now regarding your emotional development your trustworthiness and

1537
03:41:16,440 --> 03:41:21,000
sense of fair play are commendable you are an honest young man but there's always room

1538
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:26,219
for improvement a positive aspect of your adolescence is your ability to resist temptation

1539
03:41:26,540 --> 03:41:31,420
not give into your impulses since adolescence is the time for testing limits this can get some

1540
03:41:31,420 --> 03:41:36,860
people into some pretty dangerous situations on the other hand leading too much of a sheltered

1541
03:41:36,860 --> 03:41:43,590
life can be boring you seem to be enjoying most of what you do even though you experience

1542
03:41:43,590 --> 03:41:48,549
the blues in quotes every once in a while it's nice to see that you are not having

1543
03:41:48,549 --> 03:41:54,280
depressed traumatized life even though an occasional explosive outburst is common in most

1544
03:41:54,280 --> 03:41:59,319
adolescents you seem to be having you have everything well under control you seem to be

1545
03:41:59,319 --> 03:42:04,500
sensitive and gentle you certainly have a good head on your shoulders you are not only

1546
03:42:05,299 --> 03:42:10,260
book smart you also have plenty of common sense now that your adolescence is almost over it's

1547
03:42:10,260 --> 03:42:15,979
time to be hurled out there into the abyss of the real world i bet you didn't know that

1548
03:42:15,979 --> 03:42:24,069
everything you did so far was part of the fake world uh welcome to young adulthood oh my

04:12:00,469 --> 04:12:05,350
might make you feel badly if it does it only means that you are empathizing with him which

has hired a performer for the evening her name is helga the norwegian torch her talent

1766
04:19:11,639 --> 04:19:15,959
is taking off all of her clothing dousing herself with a flammable liquid setting herself

1767
04:19:15,959 --> 04:19:25,430
ablaze and dancing until the flame burns out what and the most amazing aspect of her performance

1768
04:19:25,430 --> 04:19:31,079
is the fact that she damages neither herself nor her immediate surroundings after helga's

1769
04:19:31,079 --> 04:19:36,469
performance she relaxes with the people at the party wearing nothing more than a black g string

1770
04:19:36,469 --> 04:19:42,149
at various intervals during the night she whispers to a different gentleman at the party leaves

1771
04:19:42,149 --> 04:19:47,110
the room with him for about 10 minutes and returns she leans over and whispers in your ear

1772
04:19:47,110 --> 04:20:27,829
that she would like to perform a very bizarre sexual act with you imagine the weirdest sexual

1773
04:20:27,829 --> 04:20:32,760
thing a person could do while hanging upside down and spinning by the time helga is finished

1774
04:20:32,760 --> 04:20:34,760
you don't know whether you are coming or going

1775
04:20:38,520 --> 04:21:05,450
three weeks and six shots of penicillin later it's a memory what all right let me learn

1776
04:21:05,450 --> 04:21:12,379
something let's have a college experience this episode why does everything have to be sex

1777
04:21:13,020 --> 04:21:20,170
i just want to go to college i just want to go to a friend's house i just want to deliver a package

1778
04:21:21,350 --> 04:21:30,469
every scenario is like get seduced there is a concert in the student center and you have made

1779
04:21:30,469 --> 04:21:36,260
arrangements to go with your friend bobby and his new girlfriend linda you're supposed

1780
04:21:36,260 --> 04:21:41,379
to meet them in bobby's dorm room then go with them to pick up your date you arrive on

1781
04:21:41,379 --> 04:21:46,100
time but notice that bobby and linda are a bit rumbled in appearance it seems like you

1782
04:21:46,100 --> 04:21:51,879
have interrupted a romantic interlude bobby excuses himself so that he can shower and get

1783
04:21:51,879 --> 04:21:57,000
ready for the concert linda is still glassy-eyed from tumbling around the room with bobby

1784
04:21:57,639 --> 04:22:03,899
there's a moment of uncomfortable silence after bobby walks down the hall to the showers

1785
04:22:03,899 --> 04:22:07,819
linda moves close to you and tells you that you have a bad sense of timing

1786
04:22:08,620 --> 04:22:13,739
she leans toward you and inquires if you would like to finish what bobby started

1787
04:22:24,200 --> 04:22:45,180
this game is fucked why every scenario don't do it don't do it don't do it

1788
04:22:46,139 --> 04:22:54,920
linda accuses you of being overly mellow you wonder if bobby knows what he has gotten himself

1789
04:22:54,920 --> 04:23:07,110
into no no not that scenario a friend from high school calls you up in a very serious tone of

1790
04:23:07,110 --> 04:23:11,850
voice she says she needs to speak with you about something right away her life is falling

1791
04:23:11,850 --> 04:23:24,500
apart and you are the only one who can help her um i guess i will sit with that we're gonna

1792
04:23:24,500 --> 04:23:30,870
what's what's going on what's happening you agree to meet her problem is that she has just

1793
04:23:30,870 --> 04:23:36,229
found out that she is pregnant and is confused about what she should do she can't speak with

1794
04:23:36,229 --> 04:23:41,979
her family and her boyfriend has abandoned her what will you suggest to her oh god

1795
04:23:42,940 --> 04:24:01,829
what the fuck we have we this is a conversation you go i would suggest we just got you just you

1796
04:24:01,829 --> 04:24:08,600
just got into town and i would say maybe you should go and start speak to a professional about

1797
04:24:08,600 --> 04:24:12,440
this shit because i don't know does your scenario i haven't probably i haven't talked to you in

1798
04:24:12,440 --> 04:24:19,180
a long time you this is this is this is not i i should have just said i should have just

1799
04:24:19,180 --> 04:24:31,690
this shouldn't just let it go to voicemail all right let's

1800
04:24:36,790 --> 04:24:40,870
a sensitive choice you must have realized that giving anyone such a direct piece of advice on

1801
04:24:40,870 --> 04:24:44,709
the matter as serious as this would surely be a mistake if things didn't turn out well she

1802
04:24:44,709 --> 04:24:48,870
might hold you responsible unfortunately it is often very difficult to help someone in trouble

1803
04:24:48,870 --> 04:24:54,729
sort out his or her true feelings the person may come to rely on your direction she may begin

1804
04:24:54,729 --> 04:24:59,049
to lean on you so that you begin to feel responsible for her even though you do not

1805
04:24:59,049 --> 04:25:03,610
actively try to give her advice well i don't want to say that a person can resolve a crisis

1806
04:25:03,610 --> 04:25:14,409
only by seeking professional help it is often the best way i don't have i need to study

1807
04:25:14,409 --> 04:25:23,530
relationship the thought occurs to you that it might be interesting to travel to a far away

1808
04:25:23,530 --> 04:25:28,649
place for a little while and experience new things someone suggests joining the peace corps

1809
04:25:28,649 --> 04:25:38,760
i think it's gonna take a long time i don't i don't think i would like to do that

1810
04:25:40,020 --> 04:25:45,780
uh it's not right for you at this time in life i know it's not right for me to take the

1811
04:25:46,659 --> 04:26:13,500
to do this run from your debt peace yacht run from your boat all right let's join the peace

1812
04:26:13,500 --> 04:26:17,780
corps a peace corps representative tells you that you would be spending a portion of your

1813
04:26:17,780 --> 04:26:22,819
life working in one of any number of settings the task that seems right for you is working

1814
04:26:22,819 --> 04:26:27,459
in an agricultural community in an underdeveloped nation there'll be very few any

1815
04:26:27,459 --> 04:26:32,180
if any economic rewards as a matter of fact you will probably lose out financially because

1816
04:26:32,180 --> 04:26:36,739
of what you could have been earning in a more traditional job in this country during the same

1817
04:26:36,739 --> 04:26:42,579
time period what you will lack in monetary reimbursement you will more than make up for

1818
04:26:42,579 --> 04:26:46,979
an emotionally satisfying experiences and the knowledge that you have devoted a small portion

1819
04:26:46,979 --> 04:26:53,139
of your life to helping others before you volunteer your qualifications would have to be

1820
04:26:53,139 --> 04:27:03,670
checked are you interested in joining now that you have decided to join the peace corps

1821
04:27:04,059 --> 04:27:07,829
your qualifications must be considered you certainly have the intellectual skills

1822
04:27:08,780 --> 04:27:13,979

pieces of arm leg toe and whatever else happens to fall into his cavernous jaws

bridget is thankful that beefcake likes you so what do you think about this i should keep quiet

1832
04:28:46,379 --> 04:28:50,700

04:30:48,739 --> 04:30:52,100

1874
04:34:05,990 --> 04:34:10,599

1875
04:34:10,599 --> 04:34:14,200
thinking about what it would be like to be married what do you have to say about this

1885
04:35:34,619 --> 04:35:38,790
suspicious because you've never seen to be around now you must pick a way to propose

which will it be on my yacht have the waiter bring the ring as dessert after a romantic dinner

1887

do it your own way on the boat on the boat how romantic bridget is flattered now for the big

1889
04:35:59,900 --> 04:36:03,819
moment you are waiting for her to accept or reject your proposal she accepts your proposal

1898
04:37:09,669 --> 04:37:14,869
of problems during this time unfortunately this includes you too approximately one week

1899
04:37:14,869 --> 04:37:25,430
before the wedding the following happens an old girlfriend throws herself all over you

1900
04:37:25,430 --> 04:37:29,669
and begs you to run off with her does this make you want to change your mind about the

1901
04:37:29,669 --> 04:37:44,250
wedding no no your wedding day seems to be going along perfectly it will surely be a

1902
04:37:44,250 --> 04:37:49,930
memorable occasion unfortunately you get into a car accident on the way to the wedding and

1903
04:37:49,930 --> 04:38:15,159
have to say your wedding vows in a leg cast why cindy cut your brakes your wedding night comes

1904
04:38:15,159 --> 04:38:20,279
and you climb into bed with eager anticipation bridget is in the bathroom getting ready to

1905
04:38:20,279 --> 04:38:26,540
join you the door opens bridget slips into bed next to you and cuddles into the bend

1906
04:38:26,619 --> 04:38:32,060

1907
04:38:32,700 --> 04:38:37,020
she seems peaceful and at ease the two of you relax from the hectic excitement of the day

1908
04:38:37,580 --> 04:38:44,520
you both fall asleep tired and exhausted you don't have the typical honeymoon sex experience

1909
04:38:44,520 --> 04:38:48,090
the next morning the two of you get ready to leave for your honeymoon

1910
04:38:48,090 --> 04:38:50,009
how will you be traveling to your honeymoon

1911
04:39:05,830 --> 04:39:21,340
my wheelchair use the boat can i use this is my boat it's a trip to your honeymoon

1912
04:39:21,340 --> 04:39:25,580
hideaway is a safe and pleasurable one your honeymoon is peaceful and relaxing

1913
04:39:25,580 --> 04:39:28,939
any problems you might have experienced on your wedding night are washed away by the

1914
04:39:28,939 --> 04:39:33,500
peacefulness of your surroundings this is the start of a lifetime that will be filled with

1915
04:39:33,500 --> 04:39:38,939
many emotions there is love of course but that will have to be tempered with tolerance

1916
04:39:39,880 --> 04:39:43,799
after all loving someone who loves you in return is easy tolerating her when she

1917
04:39:43,799 --> 04:39:47,959
is moody and irritable is difficult and may mean the difference between staying together

1918
04:39:47,959 --> 04:39:53,400
or falling apart admiration will sometimes be offset by petty jealousy desire for

1919
04:39:53,400 --> 04:39:58,580
companionship will sometimes be replaced by a need for solitude this kind of talk may

1920
04:39:58,580 --> 04:40:02,740
seem premature at this stage of your marriage but within the next two years things will

1921
04:40:02,740 --> 04:40:15,849
start to become very difficult why are you assuming this in the next two years two years

1922
04:40:18,599 --> 04:40:27,830
i'm still 14 all right i gotta hold on i need to take a second i'm like a giggly mess right

1923
04:40:27,830 --> 04:40:34,549
now the newness of the marriage will wear off and you will have to start coming to

1924
04:40:34,549 --> 04:40:37,909
grips with the fact that your partner is not as perfect as you would really like

1925
04:40:38,939 --> 04:40:44,360
this is not a bad thing but it is reality your ability to adjust to your partner's

1926
04:40:44,360 --> 04:40:48,279
strengths and weaknesses and vice versa will ultimately determine the success of your

1927
04:40:48,279 --> 04:40:53,779

all right i guess let me you're about to spend the afternoon catching up on some work

1948
04:45:26,970 --> 04:45:32,139
when your steady partner my wife reminds you of a promise you made to go shopping with her

1949
04:45:32,139 --> 04:45:37,430
to pick out a birthday present for her mother you did promise but right now catching up on

1950
04:45:37,430 --> 04:45:42,009
your work seems to be a higher priority your partner doesn't seem to understand this she

1951
04:45:42,009 --> 04:45:55,189
keeps saying you promised it already happened took three days i'm staying home i have to work

1952
04:45:55,830 --> 04:46:01,060
your partner gets very upset at your decision tell her she is not being very considerate

1953
04:46:01,060 --> 04:46:08,759
of the work you have to do try to find out more about why she's upset i already know

1954
04:46:08,759 --> 04:46:19,110
look i got i got school i got job i'm trying to get a child i got a lot of work to do you're

1955
04:46:19,110 --> 04:46:22,229
telling her this because you believe your immediate need to complete your work is more

1956
04:46:22,229 --> 04:46:27,209
important than her immediate need to have you accompany her on a shopping trip the real issue

1957
04:46:27,209 --> 04:46:31,529
had you taken the time to discover it is the fact that your partner feels that you are not

1958
04:46:31,529 --> 04:46:38,250
paying enough attention to her she just wanted to be with you your response to her sounds

1959
04:46:38,250 --> 04:46:42,490
hostile and insensitive your relationship will never last if you keep this up

1960
04:46:42,729 --> 04:46:55,430
while socializing at a friend's party you run into someone you had a terrible crush on in fifth

1961
04:46:55,430 --> 04:47:00,979
grade she looks even better now than she did back then she's with a guy who looks like he

1962
04:47:00,979 --> 04:47:13,700
eats apartment buildings for lunch uh no like sociable uh just say hello you are introduced

1963
04:47:13,700 --> 04:47:18,979
to duke her date who excuses himself to look for something to eat there's a table full of

1964
04:47:18,979 --> 04:47:25,080
food over there that looks unprotected make small talk and excuse yourself bring up the

1965
04:47:25,080 --> 04:47:29,979
fact that you had a terrible crush on her why would i do that i'm married you talk about how

1966
04:47:29,979 --> 04:47:34,139
things have changed and how everyone has grown up since grade school neither of you has kept

1967
04:47:34,139 --> 04:47:40,229
up with anyone the conversation soon runs out of steam and you excuse yourself besides duke is

1968
04:47:40,229 --> 04:47:46,419
returning from battle and may still be a bit hungry you never got a chance to find out

1969
04:47:46,419 --> 04:48:04,060
that it was she who had an even bigger crush on you yes congratulations the rabbit is dead

1970
04:48:04,060 --> 04:48:12,439
what oh your wife is officially pregnant over the course of the next seven months your wife

1971
04:48:12,439 --> 04:48:18,360
experiences stressful cramps water retention and nausea it is a difficult pregnancy for both of you

1972
04:48:18,360 --> 04:48:21,959
now that you and your wife are well along the way please choose the method of childbirth you

1973
04:48:21,959 --> 04:48:34,439
think is best what your wife will undergo hypnosis hypnosis for the natural childbirth

1974
04:48:34,439 --> 04:48:41,349
especially with classroom training what would hypnosis do i almost want to click this because

1975
04:48:41,349 --> 04:48:49,500
i have no idea what this fucking does i kind of want to do it i'm doing it this choice is

1976
04:48:49,500 --> 04:48:53,740
an interesting alternative to the other two not all people can be hypnotized about 20 percent

1977
04:48:53,740 --> 04:49:00,220
of us are resistant to hypnosis so there is no guarantee that it will be effective such an

1978
04:49:00,220 --> 04:49:05,540
application is quite extreme and is effective on only about 10 to 15 percent of the people

1979
04:49:05,540 --> 04:49:11,029
who can be hypnotized for childbirth hypnosis is a realistic alternative for many

1980
04:49:11,029 --> 04:49:17,509
the delivery is a difficult one and a cesarean section has to be performed

1981
04:49:17,509 --> 04:49:21,590
there are some tense moments during which you must leave the delivery room

1982
04:49:21,590 --> 04:49:29,560
you pace outside nervously but soon a shrill cry cuts through the silence of the delivery room

1983
04:49:29,560 --> 04:49:37,270
oh my gosh a baby you perform a quick inventory to make sure all the right parts are there

1984
04:49:37,270 --> 04:49:45,700
10 fingers 10 toes two eyes a quickly nose oh yes one more thing that part in the middle

1985
04:49:45,700 --> 04:49:51,130
let's have a look congratulations mom and dad you are now the proud parents of a bouncing

1986
04:49:51,130 --> 04:49:58,180
baby boy over the course of the next two days your wife recuperates from the experience

1987
04:49:58,180 --> 04:50:03,130
unfortunately there are some complications with your baby you see the baby needs to be observed

1988
04:50:03,130 --> 04:50:07,720
and monitored for the next few days at the hospital just as a precaution although it is a

1989
04:50:07,720 --> 04:50:14,869
stressful period for you the result is that the baby is healthy congratulations again here

2002
04:53:28,500 --> 04:53:33,700
the nurse to take the blood the nurse is a very thin woman in her mid-30s you notice that

2003
04:53:33,700 --> 04:53:38,419
she wears very thick eyeglasses and her hand shakes a bit she smiles at you and tells you

2004
04:53:38,419 --> 04:53:44,099
you will only feel a little pinprick you prepare for a short twinge of pain oh she must

2005
04:53:44,099 --> 04:53:50,889
be drilling for oil sorry she says as she prepares to go in again oh just a little bit

2006
04:53:50,889 --> 04:53:55,930
of trouble finding a vein after what seems like 20 minutes of unsuccessful probing she grasps

2007
04:53:55,930 --> 04:54:02,259
she gasped into light oh i just realized i'm wearing my reading glasses no wonder i'll just

2008
04:54:02,259 --> 04:54:10,310
put on my working glasses and we'll be fine now all you feel is a little pinprick imagine

2009
04:54:10,310 --> 04:54:21,349
sitting 20 minutes in that chair this is i can't do this episode i can i have to be a bachelor

2010
04:54:21,349 --> 04:54:36,619
to do that episode how old am i now 33 i got 11 fucking grand this is how old i am now

2011
04:54:37,180 --> 04:54:46,619
let's have a family experience there are none of these experiences you can do right now please

2012
04:54:46,619 --> 04:55:07,819
try again later you are in a restaurant with three of your friends and it is time to pay the

2013
04:55:07,819 --> 04:55:19,000
check the bill is 25 dollars allow another five for a tip it's all about money

2014
04:55:22,659 --> 04:55:28,259
generous cautious prudent suggest separate checks wait for someone else to pick up the bill

2015
04:55:28,900 --> 04:55:33,500
eventually the guy to your left offers to pick up the tab but then apologizes saying

2016
04:55:33,500 --> 04:55:38,279
he doesn't have enough cash he checks the cash here at the restaurant and is told that they

2017
04:55:38,279 --> 04:55:50,900
do not accept credit cards everyone must pay for himself your bill is nine dollars you've been

2018
04:55:50,900 --> 04:55:55,220
invited to a party at the home of an acquaintance when you arrive at the party you notice that you

2019
04:55:55,939 --> 04:55:58,979
and your companion have virtually nothing in common with the other people there

2020
04:55:59,619 --> 04:56:03,139
they dress differently they speak differently and listen to a different kind of music

2021
04:56:03,139 --> 04:56:07,400
i'm getting old although you are in the same room as everyone else you seem separate from

2022
04:56:07,400 --> 04:56:11,259
them you have been there almost an hour and still haven't spoken to a single person

2023
04:56:13,540 --> 04:56:21,259
select a mood uh let's get the fuck out of here i guess you feel uncomfortable with the

2024
04:56:21,259 --> 04:56:24,459
difference between yourself and the other people at the party you might have tried

2025
04:56:24,459 --> 04:56:27,740
getting to know some of them a bit better sometimes it is the difference between people

2026
04:56:27,740 --> 04:56:33,500
that make life interesting and exciting what fun would it have been to meet a group of people

2027
04:56:33,500 --> 04:56:41,590
who were nothing more than clones of yourself looking in the mirror one morning you rub your

2028
04:56:41,590 --> 04:56:52,180
upper lip and imagine what it may be like to grow a mustache yeah sure what kind of

2029
04:56:52,180 --> 04:57:05,860
mustache would you like to grow should i have a foo man shoe okay your confidence

2030
04:57:05,860 --> 04:57:09,779
characteristic shows that you are capable of enduring the comments that it will make when

2031
04:57:09,779 --> 04:57:14,419
you change your looks the more sensitive people say things like have you done something

2032
04:57:14,419 --> 04:57:18,979
different with your hair lately the people who aren't as sensitive ask you what that thing

2033
04:57:18,979 --> 04:57:24,520
hanging off your face is it's funny the way a man's life is changed just by deciding not to

2034
04:57:24,520 --> 04:57:28,759
remove something that he never asked for in the first place and can't help growing

2035
04:57:28,759 --> 04:57:35,369
but i made it a foo man shoe you begin to see yourself as a different person more dashing

2036
04:57:35,369 --> 04:57:40,409
perhaps or mysterious you look especially classy during that period before you realize

2037
04:57:40,409 --> 04:57:44,790
that food sticks to facial hair one evening you attend a show with a piece of carrot

2038
04:57:44,790 --> 04:57:50,380
decorating your upper lip that's too bad can we go on a family vacation

2039
04:57:53,419 --> 04:57:57,819
vincent has developed the habit of dashing away from you and running toward the street at

2040
04:57:57,819 --> 04:58:04,569
full speed you have tried everything to prevent this but nothing seems to work while your hands

2041
04:58:04,569 --> 04:58:09,450
are full of heavy grocery bags vincent scoots away from you and nearly gets run over by a car

2042
04:58:09,450 --> 04:58:22,540
which swerves to avoid hitting the baby yell at the baby smack the baby on the butt isn't he

2043
04:58:22,540 --> 04:58:39,669
like fucking not even two months old all these are bad these are all awful yell vincent thinks

2044
04:58:39,669 --> 04:58:43,509
you are playing a game your yelling does little to prevent this from happening again in the

2045
04:58:43,509 --> 04:58:57,349
future oh okay it's searching vincent greets you with a tiny box wrapped up in tissue paper

2046
04:58:58,069 --> 04:59:02,709
vincent teases you with it for a few moments and wants to you to guess what is inside of it

2047
04:59:02,709 --> 04:59:09,909
tell the baby you're too busy well let's play along you make the perfunctory hundred

2048
04:59:09,909 --> 04:59:15,669
guesses with no success finally vincent unwraps the present and hands it to you it's a clay

2049
04:59:15,669 --> 04:59:21,689
coaster with the words i love my daddy scratched into it a big hug and a kiss from

2050
04:59:21,689 --> 04:59:34,380
vincent completes the special treatment you are being given oh you've just passed through

2051
04:59:34,380 --> 04:59:43,779
young adulthood what this how old am i am i not how old am i this may have been a life this may

2052
04:59:43,779 --> 04:59:46,659
have been a time in your life when family activities took a back seat to establishing

2053
04:59:46,659 --> 04:59:56,619
some independence in general your family relationships are good oh fuck physically

2054
04:59:56,619 --> 05:00:00,619
you've been not very healthy you have wisely chosen to stay away from drinking and drugs

2055
05:00:00,700 --> 05:00:07,479
to a large extent in this phase of life some of the issues you have faced are what crowd of

2056
05:00:07,479 --> 05:00:12,200
people to associate with and what material items bring recognition from them somewhere along the

2057
05:00:12,200 --> 05:00:17,159
line you may have devoted a portion of your life to a worthy social cause like a charity or

2058
05:00:17,159 --> 05:00:24,520
perhaps even the peace corps your social skills are excellent congratulations on your

05:00:33,959 --> 05:00:39,159

2062
05:00:39,159 --> 05:00:44,599
you seem to be enjoying yourself even though you experience the blues every once in a while

2063

hostility is beginning to turn people away from you you are frequently grouchy short-tempered

2067
05:01:03,669 --> 05:01:08,069

2068
05:01:08,950 --> 05:01:14,069
to achieve get ahead buy a house or possibly even settle down you've gone through quite

2069
05:01:14,069 --> 05:01:21,689
a range of experiences already but there is a great deal of more to come welcome to adulthood

2070
05:01:21,689 --> 05:01:27,860
life is short the art long opportunity fleeting experience treacherous judgment difficult

apology walk him over to the corner of the room and politely ask him to watch himself

2077
05:02:09,830 --> 05:02:15,669
in the room there is dead silence he apologizes but mentions that he has a mild case of

2078
05:02:18,040 --> 05:02:34,700
cerebral palsy in crowded rooms such as this he has difficulty fucking god damn it as a result

2079

2090
05:05:06,520 --> 05:05:10,439
relatively well hidden problem but is reaching the point where she is about to

2091
05:05:10,439 --> 05:05:14,919
completely fall apart there are times when mark gets violent goes on drinking binges and

05:06:41,450 --> 05:06:46,139
feminist in the true sense of the word she simply despises and resents men a misapplying

2102

your lover that he meeting you really doesn't give you that much room to breathe i mean he's

2115
05:08:50,340 --> 05:08:55,349
you open it and read the handwritten letter inside it the letter requests that you hand

2116
05:08:55,349 --> 05:08:59,750
write 10 copies of it and mail them to 10 different people it contains testimonials from

2117
05:08:59,750 --> 05:09:04,790
the people who have faithfully performed the task to become the beneficiaries of much good fortune

2118
05:09:07,270 --> 05:09:12,919
it reads a woman in paroria after receiving this letter and carrying out the instructions

wire-haired terrier of 15 years bubba dead of a mysterious and rare canine aging disease

2125
05:09:47,770 --> 05:09:52,330
the woman felt that bubba's misfortune was the deadly result of her inability to realize

2126
05:09:52,330 --> 05:10:01,939
the importance of the letter at the time i'm going to perform the task a wise decision a

05:19:05,560 --> 05:19:15,750
as eight different yogurts or can't you just go eight right of course it counts yeah but if

enjoy making people miserable with his moodiness his arbitrary decision making and his arrogance

2248
05:26:34,740 --> 05:26:41,380

anesthesia some people are a bit timid about more natural forms of childbirth this procedure

2392
05:46:06,180 --> 05:46:11,900
is slightly more risky the delivery is a difficult one a necessary instruction has to be performed

2393
05:46:11,900 --> 05:46:16,360
there are some tense moments during which the you must leave the delivery room you pace

2394
05:46:16,360 --> 05:46:21,400
outside nervously but soon a shrill cry cuts to the silence of the delivery room

2395
05:46:23,240 --> 05:46:27,880
a baby you perform a quick inventory to make sure all the right parts are there

2401
05:47:28,500 --> 05:47:35,900
that's fucked up you and a group of friends are sitting around discussing people that you used

2402
05:47:35,900 --> 05:47:41,509
to know seems that an oddball acquaintance of yours who became a recluse always holed

2403
05:47:41,509 --> 05:47:47,139
up in his workshop has just invented a pocket golf ball washer that has earned him a large

2404
05:47:47,139 --> 05:47:53,700
fortune after making all of that money instead of retiring he has chosen to donate it to a charity

2405
05:47:53,700 --> 05:48:00,250
for homeless inventors and is now back to work sure enough just two weeks after his discussion

2406
05:48:00,250 --> 05:48:05,720
he shows up at a social function naturally everyone who speaks with him has a remark to

2407
05:48:05,720 --> 05:48:10,759
make about his behavior eventually he wanders over to the group of people with whom you are

2408
05:48:10,759 --> 05:48:19,659
having a discussion say something supportive about something that they've done in a quiet

2409
05:48:19,659 --> 05:48:28,650
voice he asks if he can speak to you privately about something yeah yeah let's go he thanks

2410
05:48:28,650 --> 05:48:32,970
you for the kind words and mentions that he realizes everyone around him thinks he's a nut

2411
05:48:33,529 --> 05:48:37,900
you've never really heard him talk at length but you find out that he really doesn't care

2412
05:48:37,900 --> 05:48:44,229
what other people think and never did he has a very enjoyable life on the whole it seems that

2413
05:48:44,229 --> 05:48:50,060
he needs five thousand dollars of seed money to get his newest project going a scheme to

2414
05:48:50,060 --> 05:48:54,459
invent a trash compactor that converts garbage into an energy product that can heat your home

2415
05:48:55,610 --> 05:49:02,459
if you invest the money you will receive half of all the profits that the project generates

2416
05:49:02,459 --> 05:49:09,639
yeah the project is a success you earn a total of fifty thousand dollars

2417
05:49:12,090 --> 05:49:18,459
fifty grand that's the most money we've ever seen i'm 59 how much money do i got

2418
05:49:18,459 --> 05:49:25,240
68 000 dollars that's enough to retire no it's not not even close how old am i 60

2419
05:49:25,240 --> 05:49:39,610
that's enough money to have another baby let's do a family experience there are none of

2423
05:50:08,310 --> 05:50:12,869
you take some ribbing from your friends but just as many people compliment you on how young

2424
05:50:12,869 --> 05:50:19,700
you are looking do you feel less depressed yeah sure go there and knock them dead like

2425
05:50:19,700 --> 05:50:24,779
you did your boss imagine if it said that you've just walked into a store and there is

2426
05:50:24,779 --> 05:50:29,209
apparently no one around to take your order it seems that the person who should be waiting on

2427
05:50:29,209 --> 05:50:34,250
you has stepped out of sight for a few moments waiting in the store with you is a teenage boy

2428
05:50:34,250 --> 05:50:39,529
about 16 wearing an old t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans he must have arrived a few seconds

2429
05:50:39,529 --> 05:50:44,490
before you he's tapping his foot lightly to the sound of the imaginary rock and roll band

2430
05:50:44,490 --> 05:50:50,729
playing in his head the proprietor steps out from the room at the back of the store makes

2431
05:50:50,729 --> 05:51:03,270
eye contact with you and says may i help you can wait am i concerned about the boy in the store

2432
05:51:04,069 --> 05:51:08,889
now there's a boy in here he's i don't know what he's doing in here

2433
05:51:10,459 --> 05:51:18,709
oh does god place my order did you realize that the boy in the store was ahead of you

2434
05:51:18,709 --> 05:51:29,819
yeah what i mean that what reason do you have for not mentioning it yeah only the two of

2435
05:51:29,819 --> 05:51:33,259
you were in this you figured you were lucky to be called first i don't know their privileges

2436
05:51:33,819 --> 05:51:41,720
with age yes that's one way of rationalizing your behavior that you would probably be the

2437
05:51:41,720 --> 05:51:45,159
first one to complain if a youngster person weren't showing you the courtesy you think

2438
05:51:45,159 --> 05:51:50,740
you deserved how would the younger generation understand courtesy if not by example if he

2439
05:51:50,740 --> 05:52:00,919
had taken your turn you probably would have put up a big fuss your car has to be taken

2440
05:52:00,919 --> 05:52:07,000
in for some minor repair work the work will not cost you any appreciable not a lot of

2441
05:52:07,000 --> 05:52:18,779
money but it will be an inconvenience since you i have a car um do i have a car when did

2442
05:52:18,779 --> 05:52:27,700
i get a car my yacht i got to drop the car off of the shop early in the morning and rearrange

2443
05:52:27,700 --> 05:52:31,939
your usual travel plans you call in to make an appointment and the service representative

2444
05:52:31,939 --> 05:52:38,389
tells you that repairs are made on a first come first serve basis and i'm an elder

2445
05:52:42,970 --> 05:52:49,509
i don't need this if it isn't major you can probably live with it right wrong clank clank

2446
05:52:49,509 --> 05:52:54,220
grind sputter cough silence your car is no longer among the living towing repair and

2447
05:52:54,220 --> 05:53:06,279
service charges of 500 that's great some backbreaking labor has to be done in your

2448
05:53:06,279 --> 05:53:12,310
home over the next few days the chore is unpleasant but important no one who lives

2449
05:53:12,310 --> 05:53:20,709
with you is willing to help to just pay somebody you're determined to avoid this

2450
05:53:20,709 --> 05:53:24,069
kind of strenuous work at this point in your life and why not you have quite a

2451
05:53:24,069 --> 05:53:28,950
bit of money stashed away you can afford it after all you can't take it with you

2452
05:53:28,950 --> 05:53:36,470
the cost of the job is 1200 that's a lot of money that i'm gonna do that's too much

2453
05:53:39,819 --> 05:53:44,619
snap you did it all right something in your shoulder just did something you don't think

2454
05:53:44,619 --> 05:53:50,790
shoulders are supposed to do your arm is hanging down at your side taking an unscheduled

2455
05:53:50,790 --> 05:53:55,560
vacation from further work you could have avoided all this but now is no time for lectures you

2456
05:53:55,560 --> 05:54:01,029
have to go to the hospital the doctors say you have torn some ligaments in your shoulder

2457
05:54:01,029 --> 05:54:04,470
you'll have to take it easy for the next few weeks physical spirit drops markedly

2458
05:54:12,709 --> 05:54:31,639
62 jesus what happened to my money what happened to my money i had 68 000 that didn't cost like

2459
05:54:31,639 --> 05:54:46,520
30 grand give me a break what during a quiet time you begin to reflect on your life your

2460
05:54:46,520 --> 05:54:51,319
accomplishments and the people around you to whom you have formed attachments you've lived

2461
05:54:51,319 --> 05:54:56,729
the majority of your life and now seems a good time as any to take inventory as you look

2462
05:54:56,729 --> 05:55:00,169
around you find that there are those much younger than you who have accomplished so

2463
05:55:00,169 --> 05:55:06,409
much more you friends who have beautiful wives in large vacation houses in the country you know

2464
05:55:06,409 --> 05:55:11,110
people who have grown up to be great thinkers and scientists there are people living who

2465
05:55:11,110 --> 05:55:26,650
have made great contributions to society but do they have a yacht no that's right i'm fine

2466
05:55:29,180 --> 05:55:32,860
you must be either quite healthy or you are resistant to facing some of the typical worries

2467
05:55:32,860 --> 05:55:37,500
associated with this time of life in case you are interested some of your friends are

2468
05:55:37,500 --> 05:55:42,939
finding themselves terribly ambivalent about their lives right now they're experiencing mood

2469
05:55:42,939 --> 05:55:48,060
swings bouts of guilt shame anxiety panic since you are not experiencing any of these

2470
05:55:48,619 --> 05:55:53,099
it would be inappropriate to offer words of encouragement i hope your outlook remains this

2471
05:55:53,099 --> 05:56:02,889
positive throughout the rest of the game while you are on a sightseeing cruise you hear a

2472
05:56:02,889 --> 05:56:07,770
cry and see a small boy fall over the railing into the water there doesn't seem

2473
05:56:07,770 --> 05:56:12,330
to be enough time to call for help because the boat is moving too quickly jump in the

2474
05:56:12,330 --> 05:56:17,900
water after the kind of calmness this situation requires is not in your personality

2475
05:56:17,900 --> 05:56:22,979
fuck instead of acting calmly you expend energy trying to keep yourself calm and

2476
05:56:22,979 --> 05:56:28,650
neglect the situation at hand panic does have a purpose it mobilizes the body and prepares

2477
05:56:28,650 --> 05:56:32,810
for an extreme situation this would have been a much better response your concern with

2478
05:56:32,810 --> 05:56:42,889
keeping calm interferes with your ability to help the boy you both drown the game's over

2479
05:56:49,610 --> 05:57:12,169
what no no no no i was so close to being old no no no why did i jump in after him

2480
05:57:12,169 --> 05:57:35,819
god damn it 63 years old no oh it's so painful to see that i had 36 grand i had a yacht no debt

2481
05:57:35,819 --> 05:58:11,580
no you rip out from under the water oh that was close that was a close call

2482
05:58:23,369 --> 05:58:34,729
out of my 65 i quit my job how much money do i have i don't have any kids anymore a young man

2483
05:58:34,729 --> 05:58:42,330
walks up to you in the park and looks you square in the eye have you got a dime he says

2484
05:58:42,330 --> 05:58:47,259
sure take it you reach down into your pocket and slowly sort through the loose change

2485
05:58:47,259 --> 05:58:50,549
it's getting hard to discriminate the sizes and shapes of the coins these days

2486
05:58:51,189 --> 05:58:54,869
you finally find one that feels like a dime you reach out and hand it to the young man

2487
05:58:54,869 --> 05:59:01,689
who looks at you quizzically the time the time he keeps saying your hearing is beginning to go

2488
05:59:06,069 --> 05:59:10,950
quantum immortality the thought occurs to you that it might be economical practical

2489
05:59:10,950 --> 05:59:15,130
and convenient to putter around town on a small motorcycle yeah

2490
05:59:16,619 --> 05:59:24,939
yeah everyone thinks you're a bit off your rocker but you think it's really great

2491
05:59:24,939 --> 05:59:28,939
on the way to the market one day you notice that there is a flat stretch of open road just

2492
05:59:28,939 --> 05:59:35,240
waiting for you to tear it up will you twist that throttle to the max yeah that

2493
05:59:35,240 --> 05:59:43,400
that that that that that did it did it did it rumor the speedometer hits 40 50 60

your wilder days as a youth as you pull away from the police officer you can

2498
06:00:16,540 --> 06:00:25,049
i'm old who fucking cares a group of men are getting together and forming a softball league

2499
06:00:25,049 --> 06:00:30,009
called the senior sluggers in order to play in this league you have to be 65 or older

2500
06:00:30,569 --> 06:00:38,659
the idea seems like a worthwhile way of getting exercise yeah let's do it okay the rules of

2501
06:00:38,659 --> 06:00:44,500
being in this league are as follows no sliding underhand pitching only every player in the league

2502
06:00:44,500 --> 06:00:48,939
must dress in full uniform for every scheduled game what position would you like to play

2503
06:00:50,119 --> 06:00:58,310
pitch at the spirit you try out for your position and make the starting team in the

2504
06:00:58,310 --> 06:01:03,110
ninth inning high pot fly is hit directly to you you thrust out your glove in an attempt

2505
06:01:03,110 --> 06:01:08,259
to feel the ball the excitement of the play fills your whole body the ball thunks

2506
06:01:08,259 --> 06:01:13,139
solidly into the glove knocking you off balance your heart is beating furiously from the thrill

2507
06:01:13,139 --> 06:01:19,700
of making the play you feel happy and carefree just like a child again suddenly the field begins

2508
06:01:19,700 --> 06:01:29,590
to fade and turn black the last thing you see are players from both benches running to greet

2509
06:01:29,590 --> 06:01:35,270
you for making such a great play something's wrong you can't run toward them your body

2510
06:01:35,270 --> 06:01:39,590
and hands won't respond to your wishes but instead of feeling frustration you feel great

2511
06:01:39,590 --> 06:02:20,840
peace how you only wish you could have said goodbye i'm dead again it's about time to get

2512
06:02:20,840 --> 06:02:30,419

2513
06:02:30,419 --> 06:02:34,259
staying alive long enough to live for another checkup is proof of another battle one the

2514
06:02:34,259 --> 06:02:38,259
doctor is young and intelligent looking he checks your eyes your tongue your heart your

2515

you to the hospital for some tests once in the hospital the tests show that you are

2517

06:02:52,889 --> 06:02:56,970
light exercise to help build up your heart and lungs just make sure it's not softball

short rest after every third step you've learned to do things in this fashion by now

2545
06:06:05,779 --> 06:06:10,040
individuals who survived this long have developed an adaptive style of living

2560
06:08:40,459 --> 06:08:45,340
tight pop she's quite a pilot once you get in the plane you observe that linda really seems

2561
06:08:45,340 --> 06:08:51,560
to know what she's doing she's rather interesting your confidence and linda grows by the

2562
06:08:51,560 --> 06:08:56,119
minute until she takes out the flight manual and mumbles i think you're supposed to push

2563
06:08:56,119 --> 06:09:01,720
the wheel forward to go down back to go up oh what the heck i'll find out soon enough

2564

2567
06:09:40,220 --> 06:09:44,060
like the flying tigers she's a bit of trouble getting the plane back of course but after a

2568
06:09:44,060 --> 06:09:50,069
quick consultation with the flight manual the plane is fine just when things have calmed down

2569
06:09:50,069 --> 06:09:54,619
she flips the autopilot switch and turns to you with a funny look in her eye

2570
06:09:54,619 --> 06:10:07,479

that one yet on occasion you must rely on public bus to get to and from the places you

2599
06:16:02,060 --> 06:16:07,450
want to go today the bus is particularly crowded and you have to stand you find an open area

2600
06:16:07,450 --> 06:16:11,770
toward the back of the bus where there is room to grasp a strong steel pole that extends from

2601
06:16:11,770 --> 06:16:17,220
the floor of the bus to the ceiling your fingers wrap around the pole tightly a fall could mean a

2602
06:16:17,220 --> 06:16:23,139
broken hip or worse as the bus moves the shock of the gentle bumps is absorbed by your feet

2603
06:16:23,139 --> 06:16:29,060
knees and legs there is some discomfort as a result you lean forward slightly so that you

2604
06:16:29,060 --> 06:16:34,380
can take some of the pressure off your lower body your back then begins to ache a little

2605
06:16:34,380 --> 06:16:39,419
girl with chestnut hair and freckles about eight years old has been watching you wide-eyed

2606
06:16:39,419 --> 06:16:44,459
for the past five minutes not long ago her mother whispered something in her ear to which

2607
06:16:44,459 --> 06:16:51,159
she looked up at you frightened and shook her head no after watching you a bit longer she gets

2608
06:16:51,159 --> 06:16:59,189
up from her seat brushes it off with her tiny hand and steps aside motioning you to sit down

2609
06:16:59,189 --> 06:17:07,540
thank you for the seat you are such a lovely lovely little darling you realize that accepting

2610
06:17:07,540 --> 06:17:11,939
the seat is a sign of neither personal nor emotional weakness is a simple fact of life

2611
06:17:11,939 --> 06:17:17,419
this child is young and in any way stronger than you she doesn't need the seat as you sit the

2612
06:17:17,419 --> 06:17:21,740
relief spreads rapidly through your body though soon your joints will begin to stiffen in this

2613
06:17:21,740 --> 06:17:34,299
seated position the child is looking at you with great relief on her face i need to get

2614
06:17:34,299 --> 06:17:44,860
married can't she pay for the wedding no nope a group of men are getting to the softball

2615
06:17:44,860 --> 06:17:51,369
league no bored don't join the team older folks get bored with life and just wait around

2616
06:17:51,369 --> 06:17:55,610
to dive wow they believe that actively fun and enjoyment are just for the young ones this

2617
06:17:55,610 --> 06:18:00,250
is unfortunate and activity is probably one of the biggest causes of depression among older people

2618
06:18:00,250 --> 06:18:04,490
the other option is i die if you don't do anything you won't interact with anyone

2619
06:18:04,490 --> 06:18:08,650
this brings on loneliness and depression take a few more risks get out there and live a little

2620
06:18:08,650 --> 06:18:19,590
and die and don't live and die at the same exact crossroads here i'm not playing softball

2621
06:18:20,470 --> 06:18:25,299
there's only like nobody's gonna walk up to me and like hand me like a hundred dollar

2622
06:18:25,299 --> 06:18:31,770
bill or something while you're sitting quietly at a party you notice a very pretty very

2623
06:18:31,849 --> 06:18:35,529
slim young woman in a short skirt bend over to pick something up she has dropped on the floor

2624
06:18:51,110 --> 06:18:58,569
would you like to change your mind no i don't want to change my mind i want to live while

2625
06:18:58,569 --> 06:19:02,569
driving the car one day you notice that the turns seem particularly sharp and treacherous

2626
06:19:07,849 --> 06:19:12,169
your reflexes are not good enough to keep up this kind of speed your car begins to swerve

2627
06:19:12,169 --> 06:19:19,529
out of control and skins off the road your car wow uh your car hits a tree and you

2628
06:19:19,529 --> 06:19:24,330
strike your head against the windshield you begin to bleed you're taken to the hospital

2629
06:19:24,330 --> 06:19:39,540
but do not recover oh fuck off why wouldn't you slow down because it's inevitable i can't do it

2630
06:19:39,540 --> 06:20:08,150
i can't i don't i had a five dollar bill in my pocket oh yeah let me just see hold on

2631
06:20:08,150 --> 06:20:20,090
i have one question just one simple question what is the end here what is this how i'm like

2632
06:20:20,090 --> 06:20:27,939
65 can i actually just skip to the end of this game after a long but very relaxing day with a

2633
06:20:27,939 --> 06:20:34,020
deep sigh you climb into bed and sink into the warm cushiony fabric as you drift off feelings

2634
06:20:34,020 --> 06:20:38,659
of intense serenity and well-being overwhelm you pleasant images of childhood visit with

2635
06:20:38,659 --> 06:20:43,619
sweet memories of mom and dad school and growing up the memories flash by your mind's

2636
06:20:43,619 --> 06:20:51,110
eye was startling reality the smell of school on your first day the outfit your very first

2637
06:20:51,110 --> 06:20:56,150
girlfriend wore on your first date you recall places you haven't visited for years in picture

2638
06:20:56,150 --> 06:21:02,069
perfect detail friends and neighbors who have gone on greet you they're filled with excitement

2639
06:21:02,069 --> 06:21:08,040
to see you though you soon realize they are not communicating their joy in words it's almost

2640
06:21:08,040 --> 06:21:20,380
as if this will go on forever okay there's that we got our closure we got our closure

2641
06:21:20,380 --> 06:21:30,860
we didn't like drive into a tree and i had 140 dollars too there you go

2642
06:21:34,340 --> 06:21:48,200

2645
06:22:20,310 --> 06:22:34,220
in a way but 1986 you didn't even become god emperor died to softball well i died i jumped

2651
06:23:25,659 --> 06:23:39,400
hours is a good stopping point only one game we beat the whole we did the whole thing but that

2652
06:23:39,400 --> 06:23:49,590
was fun that really was and i am so happy that this we can just do this all the time

2653

nobody talking right you know if it was just silent in here i thought a lot of a rank a

2724
06:37:09,240 --> 06:37:14,380
rambunctious community is an engaged community isn't it we're all having a good time at the

same time it's good that's the kind of fastness that i want that's right but thank you oh no i

you didn't know there's a permanent store there now that must have been interesting

2736
06:38:38,939 --> 06:38:50,340
because the chances of that they're not they're not ridiculously low but they are low they're

2737
06:38:50,340 --> 06:38:57,139
very low think about how many people follow this channel and how many people are on earth

2738
06:38:57,700 --> 06:39:07,659
that's pretty low chance to actually run into those people right in the same community at

2739
06:39:07,659 --> 06:39:22,779
least three six billion out of seven billion yeah no it's i've run into people randomly before

2740
06:39:25,139 --> 06:39:33,509
that wasn't when not at a convention it was like holy shit small world it was cool but

2748
06:40:36,200 --> 06:40:40,520
which i believe everyone should do from time to time stay away from the internet and all

2749
06:40:40,520 --> 06:40:43,240
anyways hope all is well with you hope you had a good time with the stream tonight

2752
06:40:55,459 --> 06:41:12,840
take care of you you gotta spend the time necessary to take care of you specifically

2753
06:41:12,840 --> 06:41:24,380
look for real lives 2007 okay why that particular version i mean reason why but yes i do i do think

2754
06:41:24,380 --> 06:41:31,560
that sometimes and i do it too pull out a little bit detach yourself from the internet

2755
06:41:32,200 --> 06:41:40,020
go do things work on yourself you know there are you've seen periods where i just

2756
06:41:40,020 --> 06:41:43,060
you know disappear for three four days a week straight two weeks straight

2757
06:41:44,380 --> 06:41:48,299
yeah i think you have to do it you have to keep yourself sort of grounded and check and

2758
06:41:49,020 --> 06:42:00,419
take care of yourself i do agree but thank you so much for the 250 and good luck again

2761
06:42:18,869 --> 06:42:26,020
a few points in this game where i was getting close to turning the car around but i think

2762
06:42:26,020 --> 06:42:34,330

fifty cents what's going on john comcast just letting you know that the game is making me

2764
06:42:38,330 --> 06:42:42,970
feel sad seeing how your character grows up has made me realize that i've taken the life

2765
06:42:42,970 --> 06:42:47,130
i've been given for granted pushing away friends and family just to make a shitload of money

2766
06:42:47,130 --> 06:42:51,130
and for what at the end of the day i may be sitting on a throne of gold but i'm sitting on

2767
06:42:51,130 --> 06:42:55,369
it alone in fact the only reason you had internet problems was so you could go and

spend a few hours with friends and family wait what thank you john comcast uh thank you leftist
