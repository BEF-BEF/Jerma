1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:09,859
You la. You lose. You laugh. You fuckin lose. You la. You lose. You laugh. You fuckin lose.

2
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:16,969
Ey, what's up. You really late? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll talk about it,

3
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:53,500
I'll explain what's going on here. Let me make a tweet, give me a sec. Okay. You laugh. You lose.

4
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,579
You laugh. You fuckin lose. You laugh. You lose. You laugh. You fuckin lose.

5
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,619
Sorry, something wrong with me. Hi

6
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,420
So you're probably looking for Monster Rancher 2. Sorry that that's not here today. I

7
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,280
Saw that house flipper had a major

8
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,900
update added a bunch of stuff in a while it's been a year I think since I've played it and

9
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:26,200
As you all know if you're been a watcher of the stream for a long time a house flipper DLC automatically turns the stream on

10
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,260
so

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,019
That's just what's gonna happen

12
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:38,340
But we can play it. It's called luxury DLC. I guess it's huge houses

13
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,340
I don't know how long is it gonna take me but

14
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:47,459
It's advertised to be some of the biggest houses. They've ever put in the game. I don't know

15
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:54,810
He hates Monster Rancher. What's your opinion on Alaska's beautiful landscape? Oh, well

16
00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:02,129
Flawed watchers skip don't skip any of my content ever

17
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,219
Let's be busy. You know got something to do

18
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,500
Let me turn my fan on back here

19
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,219
By the way, I went through the VOD some of the clips and timestamps

20
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,289
Yeah, I've when I saw people randomly writing about my sweaty armpits. I

21
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,419
Didn't I was like, what are they? Why are they saying that?

22
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,979
That was some of the worst that I've ever seen

23
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:39,849
Somebody threw water at me. There's a you look what you say you laugh you lose. That was toxic

24
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,780
Humor is so subjective. I'm surprised that even five of you are here

25
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,050
It's one of those things where people just don't think certain things are funny

26
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,810
they think certain things are annoying or stupid and some people think things are

27
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,050
Dumb some people think those dumb things are funny. Some people think the funny thing is

28
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,639
childish

29
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,509
Vodwatchers skip everything you wouldn't open up a VOD if you were gonna skip everything

30
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,460
What you should say is VOD why I'm not gonna say that because people do it as a joke

31
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:23,409
Wait, all right. Let me let's talk about we're gonna do a content update here. It's content update part of the stream

32
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,900
first of all

33
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,900
Can you even say hi? I?

34
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,699
Invited you over for dinner and you you push the door open you did a little light knock

35
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,860
I open the door the door pushes with your hand

36
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,919
Where's Monster Rancher? How about like how are my two kids?

37
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:54,199
Yeah, you know Jason and Darcy, you're not gonna talk about my twins. You know, they're they're six

38
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,960
so

39
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:09,740
Monster Rancher, how could you say something like that? It's one of the best games ever made you have two kids

40
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,740
I thought that that was common knowledge

41
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,639
This is surprising to a lot of you somehow

42
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,819
Interesting. Okay, so let's do a content update

43
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,910
You haven't been paying attention. Wait, how do you you don't think what?

44
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,819
How do you not know this?

45
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:35,550
alright, so

46
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,970
Content update I got some stuff to talk to you about today. We play house slipper DLC luxury DLC. I'm in a weird mood today

47
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,589
It's a full moon one of those big orange moons

48
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:55,139
So we're gonna play that in a couple of days. I'm gonna do a Christmas Eve stream

49
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:04,720
That's right. The first time in a long time. I will be live on Christmas Eve and that stream is going to be a

50
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:11,759
compilation of itch EO games and I get a bunch of them if you have any of your favorites

51
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,980
Stuff that you've never played because I've never done that before

52
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,579
We're talking the weird creepy scary ones to the funny ones the weird ones

53
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,620
I'm gonna put together a little compilation and play them

54
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,300
so if you have

55
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,740
Recommendations put them in the recommended channel because I'm gonna go through that and I'm gonna just get a bunch of them

56
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,500
But make sure but the same rules apply to that recommended channel. Don't just go in there and just put bullshit in it

57
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:46,990
That's Christmas Eve a few days later after the holidays on the 27th. I hope you're writing these now

58
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,399
We're going to play organ trader

59
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,170
space

60
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,050
stocks game

61
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,449
It's got a long title. I'm gonna play the or that's been recommended so many times people just want to play it so bad

62
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,050
It's a game where you trade alien organs

63
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,220
And it's like a stock market simulator

64
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:15,259
People said I it I've got like 30 recommend as just about it and they're like you need to fucking play this game Jeremy

65
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:22,740
Please so we're gonna do that on the 27th and then on the 31st. I'm still hopeful

66
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:31,889
There will be the New Year's Eve stream with the awards and the rumble pretty cool sounds fun

67
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,810
You will have that poll to be able to start voting the nominees this year. There were so many

68
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,449
It's a process to narrow this all down

69
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:49,829
So once we do that and that's done with on Christmas Eve. I am hoping that after my stream

70
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:54,769
I will be able to tweet out or talk about on Christmas Eve

71
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,529
Go vote because the poll is ready and then obviously on New Year's we'll do the rumble and then

72
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,160
We're going back to VR the first couple weeks of January

73
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,329
Maybe the second or third week of January somewhere in there

74
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:18,709
I'm gonna set the whole VR head set up again, and we're gonna do a couple weeks of VR missed a lot of stuff

75
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:23,910
I know don't get concerned. I know a lot of people just went. Oh, but but what about I'm gonna be fine

76
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,629
I'm gonna do some seated VR

77
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,800
upstanding VR sprinkled in I promise I won't puke and

78
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,449
Then I don't have a hard date for you, but I want you all to be aware of it

79
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:48,629
There's a big stream coming at the end of January that last week of January keep your eye keep your eyes peeled

80
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:55,480
For me to announce a hard date. It is not baseball by the way, and then

81
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,550
Baseball is gonna be probably somewhere in March

82
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:08,519
But there is a big stream that I've not talked about that's at that same level. It's gonna be the end of January

83
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:19,449
I can't wait getting any hints. I can't fucking wait for that stream. So there's your

84
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:32,820
Content plan the next month or two and sprinkled in there sprinkled in there be a few more announcements

85
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,100
sprinkled in there

86
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:53,899
Still owe us a catboy stream you more concerned about the catboy costume not being put on or more concerned about like the

87
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:02,820
1.7 billion dollars I still owe you you got to pick priorities here. All right, let's play house flipper

88
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,419
Yeah, I just want to give it kind of an update on how things are gonna go

89
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,980
I'm very excited especially for this stream in January. I think it's gonna be fucking hilarious

90
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:17,519
I hope it is it sounds like it could be fun. I think it's gonna be funny

91
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,620
We'll see though because it's not for me to decide

92
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,980
Yeah, I might think that but that's for you to decide. So well, I hope that ends up being the case

93
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:36,279
All right, let's go house flipper. The DLC is here make a debt payment program

94
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:46,500
There you go. So if you have never played house flipper go get it right now

95
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,470
I had to kind of redo some stuff. You notice I have a half a million dollars

96
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:59,110
That's because I cheated as I haven't opened this game in a year and to do a lot of the luxury stuff

97
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,029
I think you need a lot of money. I also missing a tool

98
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,299
I don't know what it is. So I know you'd like to make this DLC fun

99
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:14,419
I believe you need to have some money because we did this one, but I don't have this saved

100
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:24,080
You can't even hear anything. There we go. You sound weird today

101
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,580
Okay, all right luxury flipper here we go

102
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,759
So apparently how this works is we have to do like jobs for luxury clients

103
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,909
It looks like the Sims and then I think I don't know. I think we can buy real estate out here

104
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,500
You sound fucked up. I was

105
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,919
Listen

106
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,759
Wiggle your treble in your bass on your computer. When's the last time you did that?

107
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,360
Why does everybody blame me for me sounding weird?

108
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,299
Have you ever changed the dial on the bass on your on your equalizer?

109
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,080
You might be like negative eight bass right now and be like everything sounds like shit

110
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:20,179
How come the whole world sounds like shit? All right, so this is the first client you sound the same. I know I'm just giving that person shit

111
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:23,919
I

112
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:30,850
Changed the bass on your vocal cords. Okay. I mean, you know what? I've never tried

113
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:35,330
Let me see how low I can actually get without making like a funny joke voice

114
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,870
Hey, hey, hey

115
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:44,360
Hey, hey

116
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:53,519
Hey, everybody. How are you? Hey everybody. How are you doing? I'm doing really good. How are you? That's not I mean

117
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,429
That's kind of weird sounding it kind of got jokey there at the end. Yeah. Hey, hey

118
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:07,559
How do you do a low voice without being jokey it's impossible

119
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:14,110
Okay, I'm on a boat Jimmy took advantage of his father's absence and threw a huge party on the family's yacht

120
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,110
He had a great time with his friends which can be proved by the equally great mess

121
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:26,549
They left behind now the young social butterfly needs someone willing to clean it up before his father's return. Fortunately a world's a world tour

122
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:38,840
He's currently on will go for another week or so. We have to clean somebody's boat. Okay

123
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,269
Did these these freak me out by the way, I would never want to live on something like this

124
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,480
See the windows down there. Don't you feel like if like your PC was down there

125
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,059
You're just playing like fortnight and all of a sudden. Thank you. What if like water got in?

126
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:55,299
His voice acting

127
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,320
I feel like you'd open up the fucking window and a big wave would crash

128
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,480
And hit the window go in the window and like fry your computer and like electrocute you

129
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,840
Why is this voice actor

130
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:27,929
Am I timed

131
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:38,659
How much time do I have all pizza on the bed you must you must be 20 pizza on the bed

132
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Why would anyone ever do that

133
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,100
I don't want to get in trouble. I know you can save my skin

134
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,460
I have kind of a messy desk and even back when I was like 18 19 20 21

135
00:13:55,179 --> 00:14:01,039
Yeah, I had a kind of a messy room, but I would never put a cooked pizza out of the box in my bed

136
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:17,759
Who would do something like that? All right, dude, you got to do this. I have a thousand dollars. It's like a new area

137
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:28,620
Oh, I thought I could drive around. Okay, so I have to clean this boat. By the way, I have like the Santa pack

138
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:36,500
It was free. I think I don't know if that's accurate. All right, which I just clean the boat was a damage

139
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:46,399
Okay, why don't you take out containers a bunch of a bunch of the baby trays like to separate baby food

140
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:54,440
These are all fine bed between two pizzas is a calzone

141
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:01,929
Nobody does this and if you do no

142
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:06,570
Nobody has a party like this if I went to a party and it looked like wait

143
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:09,350
You can now change the stairs in some houses

144
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:22,759
What do you mean wrong? Would you sit at this fucking table? There's bird shit all over here. Somehow. I don't even know how

145
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:29,570
I'm not gonna sit at this table. I'm okay

146
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,710
Maybe I would come to this party, but I would be standing and I'm gonna wear

147
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,929
Those little booties that like the calm cast guy puts on his shoes before he comes in your house

148
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:59,490
I'm literally gonna wear those. All right, let's clean it up. It's done. Oh, it's Santa to calm cast guy

149
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:10,389
All right looks fine. Can I get the stain? All right, I got the stain

150
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,759
It's probably gonna take like 10 minutes. Not even I love this game

151
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:30,090
I I want to talk to like a psychologist because it has to be a reason it has to be I

152
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:33,230
Don't like doing this shit in real life. I hate it

153
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:45,460
Why do I think this is cool doing this in this pretend world? It doesn't matter thousand dollar budget

154
00:16:45,740 --> 00:17:02,440
Does anybody and anybody like in chat kind of a psychologist? Let's get okay. I'll trash first just close

155
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,910
It's a good stream idea

156
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,130
No, I

157
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,329
Don't know. Ooh

158
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,799
Psychologists here. It's because I missed it the chat went too fast

159
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,930
You could have just like maybe internalize a lot of things, but it will it would just be real life

160
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:47,710
Those cans I love it. So relaxing. It's broken. All right, this shit's broken. All right, sell the electric cooker

161
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:55,180
Oh, I don't sell this too. Well, they want a glass mini fridge. Oh

162
00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:05,759
Okay with the plates get these out of here sell the boat

163
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:12,539
I

164
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:20,470
Okay, do you can you do an open house on a boat do they do that?

165
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:34,930
I feel like that would be so interesting. No, it's a boat. But you know what I mean, though

166
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:43,099
I would just go to the boat open house because I've never really been on a boat before

167
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,130
Well, hold on. That's not true. I've been on a boat before I've been on

168
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,599
Okay, there's like the Boston Harbor cruise thing count

169
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Does that count with like the tourist thing where you go go do the harbor cruise?

170
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:13,630
I guess it's it's like a 30 40 minute thing. I think it's huge though. It's not like this and I die

171
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:23,539
All right. This is almost done. That looks great. Get that dirt off that seat

172
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:31,579
What did you did? Did you partake in the Boston Tea Party? I don't know

173
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:38,299
Yeah, you dude. No, but like our collective like probably fucking how many people here?

174
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:46,339
13,000 people right now. I bet you're like if we mushed up like 5,000 of our DNA

175
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:58,740
It probably was like our great-great-great uncle or something. Can I sleep on this way to use?

176
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:10,799
Ah, this is kind of nice. You don't need a psychologist to realize that you are zonked

177
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:22,240
You're not gonna go to a psychologist and ask the psychologist if I'm high what a waste of time

178
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:35,930
All right, that looks good. There's some piece of dirt right here. Whatever it is. Whoa, you can open this see

179
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:40,970
I don't want windows. No, I don't like this if there's a high wave or something

180
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,329
It's gonna just crash in and ruin your fucking like

181
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,660
Mario Party session you're having I don't think I'd want to do that

182
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,500
Is it weird that I would want my whole boat to have no windows?

183
00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:06,200
Whatever like wood or concrete or something. I wouldn't want any windows that you want a submarine

184
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,759
I think a submarine would be better. I want the whole thing in enclosed

185
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:21,089
I want an enclosed space. Look at all this shit. Did they eat up here for like three months?

186
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:38,160
I feel like they were shitting in these bags submarine Andy. Okay, I will

187
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:45,410
This is cool, right? This is cool, but it's like that only cool thing

188
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:59,910
I think about when I think about like a boat. I like I like the water. They're not paying me to redecorate. That's good

189
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:24,529
You're a fucking landlubber. What did you say? Say that again? You're a landlubber. Somebody said landlubber

190
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:41,589
Why is it called landlubber? Is that because it's landlubber? Is it actually what that is?

191
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:52,309
Because sailors wait, what what did I think it was? I don't landlubber

192
00:22:52,710 --> 00:23:00,029
What was it? I don't know. I didn't think it was landlubber

193
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:04,029
I thought it meant like like dweller like land dweller like a lubber

194
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:13,730
They done to my father's anchor my friends must have played with it at the party and now it's ruined

195
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:21,680
Is this me but I have to renovate this thing you have some tools for that, right?

196
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,900
No, you're gonna bring this like a clog Smith. I can't do this

197
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:34,779
What here's a segment of the furniture to work on first of a renovation is always cleaning the surface of the furniture

198
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,250
Every material requires a specific tool. This is wood. Oh shit. Oh

199
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:52,599
Cool I like this it must be cleaned on every side. Why don't you do it?

200
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,799
Dad cannot notice any trace of those damages or I'm a goner

201
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,559
Is dad gonna notice that I have sanded this down to all the way where the stain is gone

202
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:12,380
I'm sure he's gonna notice like the the four or five centimeters thinner that this just got

203
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:31,410
Hold right mouse button to move the camera. I thought these things were made out of steel not wood wouldn't this thing just float

204
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:43,950
What good is a wooden anchor? Am I crazy? What does this made? Is this not made of wood? Oh, this is a decoration

205
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:49,640
Okay, I thought this is the anchor. I was like, what the fuck are you doing with this?

206
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:59,349
It's not gonna stop like a forty thousand pound boat. They didn't know here

207
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,279
Okay, first cue. Ooh

208
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,930
We got it. What happened to the color?

209
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:18,970
Can you fix it? Is it imply that he's standing right behind me?

210
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:29,200
All right, what color should do about how about blue?

211
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:38,180
Wait ocean deep. No, no. Ooh

212
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,259
one of these

213
00:25:42,259 --> 00:26:02,799
Iroko no height and white no this one. It's kind of looks like Poseidon's deceptor now

214
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:08,750
It's not even an anchor

215
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:20,980
All right, spin it. It still works though. It could be whatever. It's a baby toy

216
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:34,890
It is a baby toy that looks good flip it this feels nice though

217
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:41,700
I could smell this paint you shouldn't be doing that. But you know what I mean that like fresh it just was painted smell

218
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:50,859
Did I miss anything this part? What is this? All right

219
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,299
This is like the part of the flute like the wood piece you put in your mouth

220
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:58,789
Because we could saliva and like soggy and dirty. It's one of the reasons why I never played an instrument

221
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:12,039
Especially one of the wood instrument no fucking way. These things are grosser than retainers. Yuck. Okay, so that part's blue

222
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,589
This kind of blue. No, I don't know just ocean blue

223
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:39,279
That's blue and brown looks good. You how was close

224
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,250
Looks like new to me now and my eyesight is way better than my dad

225
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:47,369
Thank you. It's your own saliva

226
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:57,279
Okay, I put the renovated furniture wherever it will present itself the best just put it like right here

227
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:12,259
I mean is this satanic if I do it like this is that bad to do this is like freaked me out

228
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:32,259
It's just anti Poseidonic, I kind of want it like this. No, it sucks over there. I have to put it here

229
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:46,180
I want to put it somewhere else like on the bar right in front of the bar and go here stupid

230
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:58,309
Replace comment on the bug you swallow. Does it taste better? I said that eight years ago. I said eight

231
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:05,490
Yeah, I didn't just didn't just happen last weekend. I don't even remember what you're talking about

232
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:10,730
Stop going back and ratioing old tweets of mine. I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about

233
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:27,740
You started about a tweet from like 2012. I think looks good there, but you remembered no

234
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,420
I didn't you know reason why I remembered is because I got ratioed last week from a tweet. I made in 2012

235
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:46,059
Okay, now what? Oh, we're gonna buy the mini fridge. Okay glass mini fridge. Let's do this one a

236
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:54,779
Lay out blacks good. She's the mini fridge go bro right here. Thanks to the captain's quarters

237
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:01,019
Is it weird that every time I just see a mini fridge all I can think about is Red Bull

238
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:16,210
The only thing I can think of is an oven. Oh, let's look. I don't care. It's not my house. It gives a shit

239
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:29,039
Okay, remove trash. Where's the trash? Oh, this job has to be a hundred percent

240
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:41,009
Alright, when do I get to have my mansion? Just try to get like I just want like seagulls to come in her and shit

241
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:59,690
All over their house. Uh, is it up? Where is this? I can't reach it. Okay, got it

242
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:08,099
Oh, it's in your probably in your dirty bedroom. Yeah, bro. Come on, man, bro

243
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:31,859
Really? Bro, what do you got under the bed? Come on. It's on the bed. Do I have to make the bed? No

244
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,079
Alright, that looks fine

245
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:48,430
Close this up. I don't think I've ever met anyone with more plastic bags than you get a canvas bag

246
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,990
It's way easier. You can put way more shit in it

247
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:57,299
You get one of those canvas bags that has like the kind of flat bottom

248
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:00,069
Instead of look here's that you want to here you go

249
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:06,259
You guys want here's a tactic ready for a tip when you go to the grocery store and you get like

250
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:11,700
12 plastic bags that you have to do like a fucking Olympic sport to take into your house

251
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:19,470
If you're strong enough to get you know what I'm saying like one bag on pinky one bag on ring finger one bag on middle finger

252
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,109
One bag on index finger if you can do that

253
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,980
Just get a canvas bag with the flat bottom

254
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:30,789
You can put all four bags worth of shit in that one bag and you can just carry that

255
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:39,980
I'm telling you don't you start doing that you don't have to do that weird awkward trip anywhere where

256
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:57,009
Some of the bags are heavier and you one of them is too heavy on the pinky and everything nice painting

257
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:22,970
Wait, this doesn't look right to me. I'm rearranging this. It's better make the bed. That was easy

258
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:32,500
Watch that watch they're gonna be a Bible in one of these. It's a broken mirror. I'm stuck

259
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:56,799
Fuck I stuck. All right, whatever who cares. Where's this broken mirror in here? What's broken? This is a mirror. What is this?

260
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:09,940
That's weird. I don't like that. Where's this broken mirror? So Oh sell it but it's not broken

261
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:23,429
You guys see I don't see a broken mirror. There's not even a mirror. This is like

262
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:35,510
Acoustic foam what that doesn't look like a mirror. All right now is this from done? Yeah, this one's done

263
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:52,349
How about this one? This is done. All right, close that up. This is done other side another staircase

264
00:34:52,349 --> 00:35:04,630
There is do you give Otto forehead kisses? Yes, of course I do. Whoa, are you eating? What is that?

265
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:16,699
Was that what was that?

266
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:35,349
Vendor I was gonna throw this trophy out the window. There's the pizza didn't even eat one slice

267
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:51,079
Not one single slice has been eaten. All right, we're gonna get some voice acting here. He's gonna be like thanks, man

268
00:35:51,079 --> 00:36:01,139
I mean if you got a home gym, you're an automatic asshole. I'm gonna have to say it. I'm sorry

269
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,610
I'm kidding. God

270
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:50,690
You're my hates healthy people. It's just it's coming with me. Do they care what I do with this

271
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:55,380
Let me put this out on the dock so people can watch me work out

272
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:10,610
Wasn't that you ten years ago? I didn't have a room in my house

273
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:16,800
That was my exercise room. My exercise room was my bedroom. My bedroom was my office

274
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:24,260
My office was my gaming den and my gaming dent was where I hung out with my friends and where I hung out with my friends

275
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:45,590
It was all the same room. It was very efficient that room fucking stinks. By the way, it smells in that room

276
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:53,380
I had to clean it once a week. All right, okay. I gotta stop like making stories up. All right, it's

277
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,659
Stupid why would I want you guys to think that I'm like disgusting? I don't know

278
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:03,820
It's some type of weird defense mechanism where if I tell you I'm gross and weird then like you can't do it

279
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:19,619
You can't say it has to be I what am I missing? Oh, these are is this dirty. Is that part of the art?

280
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:34,619
All right, this is clean. So what's left? There's nothing left

281
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:41,250
And if it's one bag of Fritos that I'm sorry, you can fuck right off

282
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:50,400
Oh was just the end of the movie where there's a there is the bag of Doritos on the ground and the door opens and it's

283
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,320
The mom and dad and it's the the car is coming down the road and they've almost got the whole house clean and right when

284
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,300
The door opens foot slides back under the couch and they always make a comment

285
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:09,340
I have really clean the houses and they kind of see they kind of see the kid or whatever

286
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:18,139
Slide the foot and they go, huh, let's wait for one of those movies for them to walk in be like, huh?

287
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:29,440
Whoa, wow, you really what is that? Is that lilac? We don't have lilac in this house. You motherfucker

288
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,969
We're all the kids

289
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:40,179
You're grounded. Wait Rick and Morty did that. Oh god. Damn it. Where's this last piece?

290
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:57,219
Diary of a wimpy kid did that? No, I'm late. You're a psycho or I would yeah

291
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:03,750
No, if I knew that that was happening, I would play along I'd walk up to shit, right? Yeah

292
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,230
Let me turn the camera for this. This is I I would walk up to like the windowsill

293
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:19,260
Just kind of be like, oh, like here's the windowsill. I'd be like, you know, I really have to clean this place

294
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:32,750
Where do I not really I'm not naked. I'm right here. I would walk around it like smell

295
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:38,420
I'd like I'd go to like the door handle and I'd be like, oh, yeah, that is clean

296
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,599
I did I remember cleaning that when I remember cleaning that son. Yeah, I did with fresh lemon

297
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:52,539
I wouldn't talk about it. I need to vacuum like weeks later

298
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:54,900
I would bring up stuff that I that I had cleaned in the house

299
00:40:55,099 --> 00:41:04,099
Because in those they do really weird shit in those movies. They'll like power wash the barrels

300
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:13,030
I haven't done that in a long time. Oh you power wash the fucking barrels

301
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:21,659
Okay, I don't I've no idea this last piece dirt is trash barrels the barrels

302
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:24,940
How what do you guys call them the trash receptacles? What do you call them?

303
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:42,650
Where is this piece of dirt the bins the cans the barrels? I'm sorry. We're from different countries

304
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,610
Yes, there are different countries on earth and we call things different things. There's a booger on my hand

305
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,550
And I hope you didn't see it

306
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,550
There's a literal booger on my hand

307
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:57,219
I don't even know how it got there, but it's there and I it may have been on camera

308
00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:03,159
That's why I have no idea why what happened where somebody just tell me so son

309
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:19,179
Where's that last piece of dirt that you're trying to hide from me? It's on the table. Yeah, I'd be like, honey

310
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:20,260
You know what?

311
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:25,019
The house is so clean. I remember cleaning this house before we left. Let's eat off the floor today

312
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:34,019
Yeah, I would sit down on the floor. Let's eat off the floor, right? Right son. Where is it?

313
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,940
The mini-map will show it. Yeah, I'm looking I can't see it

314
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:48,639
Dad dad to like make his point ends up like getting like a fucking bacterial infection from like eating a sandwich off the ground

315
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:52,489
It's the solo cups on the table

316
00:42:54,070 --> 00:43:02,670
It's not dude, bro. Why would you get rid of the solo cups dude change the stairs?

317
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:15,599
I'm not buying this for this person. No. All right, let's go. I did it. I got 2900 bucks. Oh

318
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:20,409
Oh

319
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:25,269
Here I'm not watching the stream right now

320
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:34,050
You hold on do something funny so then somebody can clip it so I can see it nothing. Yeah, what changed?

321
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:36,929
It's still is a

322
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:47,059
The Sun went higher during the day. That's all that changed. This is my ass

323
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,760
Alright to be fair. I had to load a new save

324
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:59,829
Morning a mole has dug its way

325
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:07,599
I don't whatever complete each job to unlock new houses for purchase so I can buy the boat now

326
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:24,519
Let me see. How much is the boat?

327
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,079
$563,000

328
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:41,409
What why would I ever want that I could buy like a double cheeseburger at McDonald's for 563 years straight

329
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:47,360
Times wait, that's wrong. I get I've said that rung

330
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,000
I could buy a McDouble for McDonald's every single day for

331
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:59,559
563 hundred years or something like that. I don't know math is not my strong suit. Alright, what's the next one?

332
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,750
I'm not buying that. I don't want that fucking dumb thing

333
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,840
Okay, doesn't everybody say that owns a boat. It's just it's just a hole that you throw money into

334
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:18,429
If that's what people say about a boat and then people say oh when you own a home

335
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:24,920
I'll be aware when you own a home. You got all kinds of maintenance. You got to do a boat and a home combined

336
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:28,019
seems

337
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:36,599
Like a lot of money to just put in and throw away at that point

338
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,889
This should be like just a mechanic that lives in the house with you. Okay a new chapter

339
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:46,889
Moonrise Bay welcomes Hiroshi and Yuna with open arms this young couple of computer engineers

340
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,449
Who both got jobs in town had been looking for a place to make their own

341
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:55,840
Help came from friends in the area who offered to sell them their unprofitable printing studio

342
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:00,949
Now the newcomers just need a little more help with changing into a living space. All right, let me help you

343
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:14,900
I'll never forget when you pushed me off that cruise ship in 98 as a joke

344
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:23,750
I've heard you're just starting in Moonrise Bay, but it shouldn't be a problem. So are we hey

345
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:31,329
For $2,500 can you make a new house inside of the house? That's here now great

346
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:46,199
They're big fans of this game

347
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:54,000
More about it when you're done with the cleaning. Wait, so I have to clean and then I have to do a new chapter

348
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:04,389
What button do I press? I?

349
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:12,210
Get out of here. Oh, just walk. I'm at the wrong. Oh wait

350
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:18,900
Well, this person needs it. Does everybody need their whole house renovated? I'm at the wrong door

351
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:28,789
Well, I don't know. I'm not cleaning their door. Oh boy. All right, I have to change the stairs

352
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:43,309
Okay, you got a pretty good view change that window out. How much do I get for this? Oh my oh wait

353
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:46,710
My budget's $26,000. Never mind. I said three

354
00:47:50,829 --> 00:48:01,860
They're paying they're paying. All right, I was jump the gun on that one. I apologize. I kind of want to dispose of this

355
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,139
All right

356
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:07,360
Do I hold on a minute are they gonna be mad that I'm gonna wipe the paint off?

357
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:15,119
Where's that like a don't touch that that adds to like the aesthetic of the apartment, right?

358
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,119
I feel like that could be like a point of contention

359
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,090
Who wants pain? I don't know like it's look look at all look though

360
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:28,760
It's like look at all the paint on the ground stuff. No, I don't know

361
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:42,420
What's this stuff? Why they're just gigantic filters here like water filters these pool filters. What are these?

362
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:56,960
All right, let me let me get the shit out of the way. Do you see the new fortnight item shop? I have

363
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:07,940
Never opened a fortnight. I don't I've not got that far something always comes up. That's more important

364
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:17,929
Isn't this all kind of trash liar? I mean, I've opened the

365
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:30,159
EXE file I've never actually gone into a game. I never looked at the store. This is kind of a this is a mess

366
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,449
This looks like when I close my eyes and put my hands on my eyes

367
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:50,969
Stream fortnight for 500k off the debt. The only way I will ever stream fortnight is if I do the fortnight joke

368
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:54,960
I'll tell it to you again because I

369
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:04,639
Just in case it ever happened. I'm gonna be in like a backwards hat with big sunglasses on in like a

370
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,619
Like a tank top. I'm gonna be in like a

371
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:14,940
Lit up room and in the room. I'm just gonna be sitting there with a vape pen

372
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:21,750
Like a big vapor and I'm just gonna vape and play fortnight and I'm gonna have I don't know

373
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,909
I don't know why I think this is kind of funny

374
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:26,510
But I'm gonna make my like I'm gonna put my voice changer on just like a tiny bit

375
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:32,480
And just like talk shit to people while I play and slowly over time

376
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,760
The whole room is gonna like in the face cam is gonna be like face cam at the bottom

377
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:42,369
Slowly over time you're gonna notice that it's just like you you can it's starting to get way too foggy in there

378
00:50:42,369 --> 00:50:46,010
And it's gonna get to a point where you can't see me anymore

379
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:55,150
I'm covered in fucking fog and then you're gonna start to hear like the fire alarm and the stream is gonna end

380
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:58,880
When like a fireman breaks down the drywall behind me

381
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:08,039
I have I've talked about that making that joke for like four years and I've just never done it

382
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:15,039
You could probably go back to timestamps of me talking about this from like

383
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:30,699
2015 2016 actually this is kind of cool a little like why is there a break room in the apartment?

384
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:40,789
Well, cuz it's a I'm just selling all this stuff, right? Yeah, cuz it used to be a

385
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:56,360
It used to be an art studio. It's a kitchen. Wait, what? Is there no kitchen downstairs? That's kind of weird

386
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:09,360
So there's no the kitchens up. It's a room next to the bedroom. This is a bedroom. What is this? This is the closet

387
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,039
What's going on here? It was a printing press

388
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:27,690
Yeah, I gotta get let me get rid of all the trash first sell the tables to get rid of these fucking tables

389
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:38,480
What are these old doors? These are all messed up and out this window

390
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,599
When you're gonna play among us, I told you I'm gonna play among us when the among us VR comes out

391
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:59,199
They'll just sell everything. I don't know if I'm supposed to be doing this, but I did it

392
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:10,409
I take this wall down too. Oh, I can't it's already out. Well, I mean and I'm doing VR in January

I'll make sure to let you know where the pole is so you can vote another doesn't actually another reason why I want to stream

403
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:13,110
Cuz I want to make sure people know it where it is and when it's there and then after that

We're gonna do VR for a couple weeks. So that's where among us VR will be

00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:29,239
I'm gonna get roaring applause and then uninstall the game and never open it again. Then after that

407
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:34,719
There's a big stream, which you will not have any information on because I'm not gonna give you anything

408
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:42,159
Somewhere in like the third or fourth week January. I'll give you a hard date on that when I get it. There's a lot going on

409
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:54,380
Should be a lot of fun. And what about Monster Rancher? No Monster Rancher is not over

410
00:54:54,380 --> 00:55:00,920
Yeah, you might see that on the 27th depending on how much fun I'm having in um that

411
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:12,420
Organ trader simulator. I still have to beat that game. I love that game to sell 41 objects in here

412
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:22,070
I just have an entire place. Oh jeez. What about this? All this stuff is it could be repurposed though

413
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:43,949
You could like spin this around connect the two pieces and make it a bed. It's called house flipper. I know what it's called

414
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:54,280
Oh, yeah, you're condescending little comment. I could never be like that with you guys

415
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,210
I really don't think I I don't think I could ever actually be like that

416
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:22,559
That like kind of makes me feel like bad and like odd I'm stuck in the window more stuff this all

417
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:35,500
What I make last time after like they'll do in a little bit of

418
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:39,900
Tutorial stuff. I did this saw house, right? I have no idea what I'm gonna do now

419
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:48,150
at some point it's gonna be like just improv yell out a few words and

420
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,420
a place

421
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:58,630
And an actor huh?

422
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,920
snow

423
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,119
Sheldon from Breaking Bad and

424
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,840
Doctor's office, okay

425
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:22,699
I'll break a big bang theory. All right, so new stairs. I don't know what they like

426
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:44,480
Whatever really quick question. Do you think Sheldon would be a meth user?

427
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:51,949
Character in Breaking Mad or a meth creator. That's a tricky one. It could go either way

428
00:57:51,949 --> 00:58:13,360
I have to actually clean this user easy. No, this would scare this shit out of me

429
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:36,820
Do you have an idea what this sounds like? It's like that's like loud and scary at your door. Okay. Now we need to do

430
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:43,719
Okay, it's time to get some decoration in here sell object. What else?

431
00:58:44,719 --> 00:59:03,409
But it's so cute hurt in the corner. Thank you. We should have sell the toilet

432
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:06,670
Oh, we're not this is not a custom job. I

433
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:24,820
What's the point of having a window this window has one purpose and that's to jump up here open it like this

434
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:32,280
Crouch lift and fart out of here because you don't want anyone in the house to know you did it this serves no other

435
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,119
purpose

436
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:52,829
It doesn't do anything else. That reminds me the windows that no, I don't why I need to open the whole window

437
00:59:53,349 --> 01:00:06,719
It's not enough. You can't run away and fart somewhere in this house. It's just a big open room

438
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:15,280
There's not even a bathroom. Oh, there is never mind. What no you I don't know. I don't want to know

439
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:24,099
Now I'm going like this I'm opening this and I'm gonna stand up here brace my legs here push up and I'm gonna like

440
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:31,690

441
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:36,000
I'm gonna close it and be like, hey, so what's uh, what's going on up here, man?

442
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:50,389
Yeah, I'm checking out downstairs pretty it's a pretty slick place. You got here. Wait. Why can't you do that with a regular window?

443
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,760
because

444
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,920
No, my point was it's this is the only thing you can do with this window

445
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,500
Doesn't do anything

446
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:16,239
You just sounded 50 years old there for a second. All right, stop distracting me. I've got things to do

449
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,440

Okay, standing set. This is where I should put this. This is a weird house. Okay Hubbard

458
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:59,539
I'm in straight to cooking. I actually don't hate it. None of this matters

01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:02,940
We're just trying to blow through this so I can get to the big house so I can get I can actually make my dream house

There's gonna be a long one. Hope you're ready. What a dumb fridge. It looks like a school locker

462
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:34,679
What is that? Yeah, I don't care about any of this person shit who?

468
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:51,880
I have to how many times I have to make it clear. This is not my house

469
01:05:51,880 --> 01:06:32,360
I care nothing about it. Why would you look at all this? I don't wouldn't sliding door another wooden sliding door

470
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:37,480

474
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:56,760
Where's the bed go up here? I feel like lying in this bed. That's fine lay floor tiles light oak mosaic

475
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:18,310
And that was already on the ground. This is uglier. He's a kitchen tiles

476
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:22,979
I'm just going by what the customer wants me to do

477
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:35,420
I I'm not what the customers said to do you and I might think this looks really weird

478
01:08:35,659 --> 01:08:44,590
Somebody just said I have no confidence. This is not my house

479
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:48,630
I'm trying to speedrun this we get to go by the big house so that I can actually do what I want to do

480
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,869
I want to take down walls. I want to have like a dining room

481
01:08:50,869 --> 01:08:53,350
I want to have a

482
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,390
showcase room I want to have a

483
01:08:55,789 --> 01:09:00,329
Room where I like a game show room like a showcase like prices, right?

484
01:09:00,329 --> 01:09:13,159
I said that's done up there think of someone else for once in your life people that are moving into this house

485
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:15,829
I'm not real. They're

486
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:21,140
Imaginated people that the developers made to teach you some of the new things that are in the new update

487
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:26,020
I don't care about these imaginary people all I care about is myself in my real imaginary world

488
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:42,500
Which is my fake house that I'm about to build because it's me making it got a little heated there. Oh TV

489
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:52,800
I put it up there. I can't put it. Oh, it has to be sitting on something

490
01:09:52,800 --> 01:10:06,550
Oh like this kind of reminds me of the first house everybody makes in the sims

491
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:13,340
This big open square and the TV is far away from everything else

492
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:20,270
And there's just a big table in the middle and nobody knows shit about how to design cabinets

493
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:32,470
So everybody's house looks like this in the sims you guys can all sit there and criticize my choice of cabinets

494
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:55,789
Well, we all scroll over that we just scroll by it. What is this? Oh wardrobe? Okay, do these this is a fridge

495
01:10:56,149 --> 01:11:07,939
No, let's get out. This is the wrong spot. Why is it so dark in here? Oh

496
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:19,729
This stuff is cool, but I really don't think I only have enough clothes to fit in the first three

497
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:33,180
Then not nothing else will ever be used. Oh get the paint bestie aided a mirror. Oh paint with white cool

498
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:42,510
It's dark and hey, how do I go get the paint?

499
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:57,319
Bestie is there no light switch to turn these lights on you're now manually breathing. You can't get me with that one

500
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:26,449
So dark turn. Oh, there we go shit was already white in here. Oh waste of money waste of money, but it's whiter

501
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:38,439
Now you're gonna tell me it's gonna brighten up the room. I don't want to be in a room

502
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:41,739
That's this bright white people will see how yellow my teeth are

503
01:12:41,739 --> 01:12:55,800
Hey for all my friends of that that shave when you get the shaving cream on your face and you go

504
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,520
My teeth are fucking green. What is going on?

505
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:11,090
Y'all know that you look in the mirror you smile

506
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:29,029
Why am I teeth like fucking green and gray and shit? I'm telling you it's weird

507
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:52,119
I take good care of my teeth, please nobody shaves

508
01:13:52,439 --> 01:14:05,439
What do you mean nobody shaves here you and what's it? What are you implying? You implying something? What's that supposed to mean?

509
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:27,380
I don't care. Oh, wow

510
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:55,319
It's important. Yeah, what a makeover. What's the next? Can I buy it now? I can't buy it

511
01:14:55,319 --> 01:15:05,550
I can only why can I only buy this houseboat? All right. I think this is what we're gonna get a big house

512
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:16,689
There's one here. I was the contractors. There's another one somewhere. Well, what's this one business-as-usual?

513
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,720
Businessman with extraordinary taste wants to have an apartment close to his company headquarters

514
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:28,479
Therefore he purchased this one previously owned by a party-loving editor-in-chief of a famous angling magazine

515
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:32,989
Coincidentally, it turned out a very special girl officer works nearby

516
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:36,029
Christopher already has a list of ideas when it comes to necessary changes

517
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:45,060
All right bare minimum bare minimum where we gone the Walker family trusted the wrong people when it came to working on their new home

518
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:53,399
Okay, Benjamin a very gentle man didn't manage to keep them in check and his wife Naomi had to step in when she'd gotten back

519
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:57,000
From her business trip. She was astonished by the state of the house at this point

520
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:12,069
They need a true professional who'll be islanded this one. What happened? What did you would you hire the Tasmanian devil?

521
01:16:25,819 --> 01:16:30,779
You don't understand he's just purple guy and he's got a big mouth

522
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:36,220
His mouth of this mouth is the size of his whole body and he spins and he was holding a hammer

523
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:39,899
Could you check if it's still fine? I hid in the bathroom for four hours

524
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:50,050
The kitchen it's such a mess all around it also looks like they finished nothing upstairs

525
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:52,779
Those will be our personal room

526
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,819
purple the Tasmanian devil's purple

527
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:06,189
Yeah, what what do you mean he's not purple what are you talking about?

528
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:11,500
Push the sofa off the ramp. Wait, who did I do this?

529
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:17,390
I think me and this guy work for the same company cuz I feel like I did that shit to people when I played this before

530
01:17:17,989 --> 01:17:19,979
He's brown

531
01:17:19,979 --> 01:17:24,949
No, the Tasmanian devil is not. What are you talking about?

532
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:44,819
Tasmanian devil. Oh, I'm thinking about his there's I'm thinking about his little fucking son. They're a little dizzy from Tiny Toons

533
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,260
Yeah, I'm thinking about his son

534
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,420
Yeah

535
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:54,020
Whatever wrong animal cares he's literally he's not alright

536
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:57,460
I'm gonna I have to shut everybody up cuz I need to put dizzy devil on stream right now

537
01:17:57,819 --> 01:18:12,840
Is he devil is Tasmanian Tasmanian devil's bastard son or something? I have no idea. What do you mean fake? It's not fake

538
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:25,699
I'll show you right now. This is dizzy devil. No, I didn't come up with this in a dream

539
01:18:25,699 --> 01:18:27,699
This is a character in Tiny Toons

540
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:37,720
See, that's who came through their house. This must this means the Tasmanian devil has had sex. Yes

541
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:48,359
So if two Tasmanian devil characters have it they did this

542
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:53,460
Scream at each other and run around the house and they spin around. How does that happen?

543
01:18:53,699 --> 01:19:13,880
That's a question of not thought of new topic. Please. Please twitch ban him

544
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:20,100
He's the worst thing we talked about on the stream is this is how in quotes

545
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:24,979
How does the Tasmanian devil have sex? That's where you draw the line

546
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:34,159
The last time I played this game I put a sex swing upstairs. Give me a break

547
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:50,609
All right, so they like trash the place. This place is kind of swanky. I like it. Imagine the sounds he would make

548
01:19:50,609 --> 01:19:56,609
I don't think they would be very different

549
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:02,000
It would be different

550
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:26,310
Would it be I'm curious

551
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:31,800
What does he sound like?

552
01:20:33,600 --> 01:21:00,109
Hold on he's always home of loose

553
01:21:06,539 --> 01:21:10,270
Okay, so that's what the Tasmanian devil just sounds like

554
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:22,119
So I'm gonna assume it would be a little slower it was a little bit slower it sounds something like this

555
01:21:56,069 --> 01:22:03,380
Interesting he sounds like the drive-through guy from yesterday

556
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:18,260
Oh

557
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:24,600
Somebody said clear your history. It's just the Tasmanian devil screaming

558
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:37,970
All right for those folks at home if you want go ahead and do your own little fun little project

559
01:22:38,729 --> 01:22:43,180
just what you do is you take you take what we just did and

560
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:49,989
You have you make two of those tracks and then you make pitch one of them up or pitch one of them down doesn't matter

561
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:53,590
There I'm not gonna do it here

562
01:22:54,109 --> 01:23:11,930
Okay, let's let's continue what we're doing do the tutorial I was about to Tasmanian devil

563
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:15,960
I was about to scream Tasmanian devil on you. I was gonna drop that on the stream

564
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:25,569
I was about to drop right on the stream a full-on Tasmanian devil, but I've talked about it before and I'm not gonna

565
01:23:26,859 --> 01:23:31,619
Yeah, no, we've done this routine before no, we'll not that last one exactly. But this one

566
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:35,979
You cannot do a Tasmanian devil impression

567
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:43,500
Unless you go 100% all-in as hard as you can you can't half-ass a Tasmanian devil

568
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:56,939
You go all-in or don't do it at all. I'm not doing it. No do it. You got to go all-in do it

569
01:23:57,079 --> 01:24:01,260
No, I can't I don't have the confidence that I can go all-in right now

570
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:13,100
I really don't think I have the confidence to do it right this minute. All right, let's modify. Let's hold on so much trash everywhere

571
01:24:13,539 --> 01:24:26,760
This is really pretty do it. We need to sample it. You're not sampling shit

572
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:28,800
by the way

573
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:41,680
Buddy, I mean enough to clean the windows anymore. I will just do the bathroom first. We're here

574
01:24:42,279 --> 01:24:43,760
It's clean

575
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,239
Alright, they want to remove trash. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine

576
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:59,859
Alright, they want to do wall tiles at these wall tiles. What are these? Oh, I like this. This is smoky

577
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,420
I'm not your buddy. Alright pal

578
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,579
Okay, pal

579
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:34,289
Settle down. Hey friendo sans no

580
01:25:34,569 --> 01:25:40,420
Wait, do you you actually have the clip you already? Alright, so how long ago is this?

581
01:25:40,619 --> 01:25:45,460
This clip that you're about to hear was from like a year or two ago

582
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:50,979
A lot of you guys might not have heard it. This is me trying to do the Tasmanian devil going all-in

583
01:25:55,560 --> 01:26:00,069
You can't do it and and I laughed at the end

584
01:26:04,579 --> 01:26:14,149
Yeah, it's impossible I did it again after that I did you have a

585
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:23,300
Documented evidence of me doing it again. Why did I do it twice? What I have to do?

586
01:26:23,619 --> 01:26:32,539
Alright snowy marble and oh they want both. Oh, I see what you're trying to do here. That one wasn't good

587
01:26:32,539 --> 01:26:49,930
That was not the real attempt. What was that? That was it's inside the window. I

588
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:54,960
Thought I don't know why I just thought somebody shot me the gun. I don't know why it was weird

589
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:05,930
Big stream in January. Alright, there you go. There you go. You got it. It was two years ago. Wait, hold on

590
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:10,840
Are these different streams?

591
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:17,079
Wait, did I do this on two separate streams like more than like six months apart? I

592
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:42,529
Can't do it again, you need to slow this down. No, I hold on. Should I try it again?

593
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:52,770
Hold on. I have to let me hold on a bit. If I cheat I could probably get it. Let me let me cheat

594
01:27:53,979 --> 01:27:56,989
I'll cheat. I'll see if I can get it

595
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:03,800
This other in the world of voice work. They they do this stuff. Okay, third time's a charm. Here we go

596
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:08,500
I

597
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:18,319
Not doing it with a face cam, are you kidding me? No

598
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:28,739
Mute this mute this because I want to be able to have this as a I don't want you to have any sound in the background

599
01:28:41,319 --> 01:28:43,319
Okay, I'm gonna pass out

600
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:49,340
All right. I'm okay. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm okay. How did that one sound?

601
01:28:49,819 --> 01:28:51,340
That one's not okay

602
01:28:51,340 --> 01:29:05,529
Was that one better than the other ones? I hear it. What do you mean fecal funny?

603
01:29:05,529 --> 01:29:09,210
That's the Tasmanian devil sticks his tongue out at the end and goes with his tongue

604
01:29:09,649 --> 01:29:23,329
Was that better than the last one was it unironically good? I know are you kidding me? No mute this

605
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:28,170
Mute this because I want to be able to have this as a I don't want you to have any sound in the background

606
01:29:28,489 --> 01:29:35,189
Well, I have sound

607
01:29:37,189 --> 01:29:41,859
No, I don't think that was really I don't think that was good. I don't think that was good

608
01:29:41,859 --> 01:29:43,859
That was even close

609
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:53,949
Just the guy from Star Wars. That was the frog guy from Star Wars. That was not the Tasmanian devil

610
01:29:56,260 --> 01:30:02,399
I was just shaking my face. That was not even close not even close

611
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:07,279
That's not even fucking close

612
01:30:09,079 --> 01:30:12,199
Yeah from the Phantom Menace

613
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:23,510
Because listen to the other one the other one is so much better because the Tasmanian devil has a very distinct he goes like

614
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:32,000
Right and it's all over the place

615
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:50,710
See like the pitch changes and stuff. This is just me shaking my face and screaming play them together. It will be perfect

616
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:54,569
Oh my god, you're right. It actually would be I gotta get this cute up

617
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:04,399
Okay, I'm done. We're not doing this anymore

618
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:14,699
No, I'm not gonna you want to go all in you're arguing with yourself, okay, I

620
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:41,800
Maybe I could do dizzy better. No, is he devil? Oh

621
01:31:56,079 --> 01:32:01,319
Yeah, I can't go all the way

622
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:20,670

623
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:34,750

625
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:41,579

01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:04,489
You know what? I'm talking about. That's the only thing I can find

629
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:33,560
All right, I'm done. That was fun. I like cracked my back doing that. I like feels good. We're stream 2021

Get out of here and ban them. Let's put the bathroom in. All right, we need to put a

632
01:34:04,359 --> 01:34:07,760
Delicate bathtub. Ooh

633
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:30,840
No, don't do it. There's already too many of those this thing's huge what this thing's weird. Very nice. Very nice

634
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:43,720
There's the walls you lunatic. No, I don't care. I'm just trying to unlock stuff. We're just getting for only 60%

635
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:49,229
That's it. It's banned people

636
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:53,430
Well, you don't have to okay

637
01:34:53,869 --> 01:34:55,750
compact

638
01:34:55,750 --> 01:35:03,720
What was that compact WC enu? Oh, it's a toilet. I might as well have it match

639
01:35:16,689 --> 01:35:29,199
Mountable shower. How about this one? How am I supposed to put this? I might do this. Oh, okay

640
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:51,500
Let's get out of the way right in the corner. Oh, I would love to mount a shower here. I do this wrong

641
01:35:51,539 --> 01:36:26,279
Oh put it together. Very nice. There might do a teehee for us. I already did. Ah, I'm good

642
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:51,859
Actually, I like the sounds this make sounds really nice. It'll like ring ring ring. This is on easy mode

643
01:36:51,859 --> 01:36:53,859
You can actually put this on hard and I think it takes a lot longer

644
01:36:54,180 --> 01:37:13,140
Cool. All right. Now they want a mirror a mirror and Lamont here

645
01:37:13,659 --> 01:37:30,329
Mirror Lamont, I think a good beach finish. Sounds good. I want a TV. That's a pretty that would be like that'd be awesome

646
01:37:30,329 --> 01:37:34,409
Just had a TV right here to me. Oh, there's mirrors, right?

647
01:37:34,409 --> 01:37:54,750
So yeah, I wouldn't want this is not where I want that. What would the purpose of a mirror right here be still watch?

648
01:37:55,909 --> 01:38:15,680
Yourself, where's the sink gonna go right here sink that not a sink. We're not doing a double sink

649
01:38:15,680 --> 01:39:04,199
Are we he's wrong off-center? It's not my house. Okay, and this fit this mirror is not big enough

650
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:08,979
All right. Now we need to lay floor tiles

651
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:15,050
These ones sounds good. This is actually looking really nice

652
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:32,640
What happened it's the same

653
01:39:33,159 --> 01:39:42,880
Minecraft power. This is a Minecraft bathroom. I do this wrong lay wall tiles

654
01:39:43,039 --> 01:40:00,199
They don't want these on the ground. These are floor tiles. Did I do the wrong thing or is it just this ugly? No

655
01:40:00,199 --> 01:40:21,270
It is like this. I don't know looks exactly the same five nights at Freddy's flashlight

656
01:40:21,289 --> 01:40:42,359
It actually is how do you come up with that? That's so clever. It's just the unity light

657
01:40:45,989 --> 01:40:47,989
Isn't five nights at Freddy's made in

658
01:40:49,939 --> 01:40:54,840
Out of stone or something. It's not even made in regular game engine

659
01:40:54,840 --> 01:41:12,819
I thought the original five nights at Freddy's was made in some weird game maker. Wasn't it? It's not made in unity

660
01:41:12,819 --> 01:41:24,640
It was made in fusion. Yeah, this how this bathroom gives me anxiety. I don't like it

661
01:41:26,689 --> 01:41:39,829
Hey, I'm bumpy. Hey, I'm bumping you know, I don't gotta live here. Hey, that's not I don't what all right bathrooms done

662
01:41:40,630 --> 01:42:09,539
Wait hangar a little towel rack. I I want one of these I don't want like three of them Christmas is coming. That's right

663
01:42:09,539 --> 01:42:13,829
I

664
01:42:48,729 --> 01:43:02,850
Go you scared the shit out of me. Yep. Well the paper. Okay what this is that?

665
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:09,739
I was wondering what this was like a coat rack. I thought this was like a fireplace thing. This is for toilet paper

666
01:43:09,779 --> 01:43:11,180
I'm gonna knock this over

667
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:16,970
You are going to reach for this and knock this over and get pissed cuz then the toilet paper hits the ground

668
01:43:17,289 --> 01:43:22,729
Why that takes up so much space?

669
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:44,100
There's a backpack this looked like a backpack from here. The counter is not big enough

670
01:43:44,100 --> 01:44:05,319
I just I just had to blink a few times did that freak anybody else out to that was weird like opening it with the door

671
01:44:05,319 --> 01:44:12,199
Moving because I still had it selected. That was kind of odd looking wasn't it? All right, this

672
01:44:12,699 --> 01:44:14,699
This room is done. I don't need to do any more

673
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:32,020
Just got to get to the progress and that's it this out of here the door isn't lined up idiot

674
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:42,170
The door is not lined up

675
01:44:42,489 --> 01:45:16,659
Oh, no, I get no I don't get much more joy in life and watching a stadium full of 15,000 people

676
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:25,000
Think that something's wrong with me. All right

677
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:47,069
This looks nice sure cuz I'm not like this over this one. Why is it?

678
01:45:50,390 --> 01:46:15,350
Hello, this must be inspiration bubbles. Why I don't get it. I guess looks all right. He's sitting on the stage. Wait, hold on

679
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:18,949
He's sitting on the stage with his PC set up with a spotlight on top of them

680
01:46:18,949 --> 01:46:25,500
Oh 15,000 people just watch and throw popcorn at him. I think the more accurate thing would be

681
01:46:26,739 --> 01:46:29,819
Half of you are on your phones

682
01:46:29,859 --> 01:46:39,500
Watching someone else. I don't know why I sometimes I feel like you you're like the big grudging

683
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:45,020
You're like the begrudging husband that went to the show and you got to catch the game

684
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:49,939
You just like have me open the tab and you're doing something else

685
01:46:50,140 --> 01:47:14,199
You got like the Golden Knights game on like in on your lap while you're at the show really cool. Okay, who's a wall finish?

01:57:47,390 --> 01:58:00,789
That's the easy answer. I'm scared though, cuz that's every single person says that and

729
01:58:03,149 --> 01:58:09,229
The more that people collectively in their brain internalize how excited they are about a thing that comes out

730
01:58:09,470 --> 01:58:12,819
It usually increases the chance that it's gonna be bad

731
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:22,050
The universe does this weird thing the more that people care about something before it releases the worst they decide to make it

732
01:58:22,449 --> 01:58:28,140
No, I'm not trying to get too excited about it

733
01:58:41,859 --> 01:58:48,449
Cyberpunk yeah, although who knows this might be a no man's sky

734
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:51,250
scenario and

735
01:58:51,250 --> 01:59:07,260
Two years from now cyberpunk is an amazing game. It could be do you believe in ghosts?

736
01:59:07,699 --> 01:59:11,949
Um, I believe in radiators

737
01:59:11,949 --> 01:59:17,619
Faulty hot water heaters add radio signals and

738
01:59:19,899 --> 01:59:27,720
Wind that's strong enough to make the windows move around but that answers your question

739
01:59:28,039 --> 01:59:52,460
All right, you want a vial damn right side shower and do that. I don't know about ghosts

740
01:59:52,460 --> 02:00:13,159
No, I don't know about ghosts too. Too many people have died

741
02:00:13,479 --> 02:00:21,239
All you would hear was the noise you hear at a baseball game

742
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:34,229
If there are people like our ghosts and they're just walking around just like kind of floating around they would be like

743
02:00:34,789 --> 02:00:39,260
70 billion ghosts

744
02:00:39,300 --> 02:01:06,310
70 billion ghosts just all talking over each other. I get rid of these you believe in the Power Rangers

745
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:15,260
Yes, I do because the Power Rangers are real even though there are a fictional group of characters

746
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:18,340
They're actually in the costumes and they're actually pretending to fight stuff

747
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:30,789
I've had an experience with a Power Ranger before right? I've seen a Power Ranger. I've never had an experience with a ghost and

748
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:56,279
I'm just realizing what I'm doing here. Okay, look Ben. That's about your experience with a Power Ranger. I don't like

749
02:01:57,239 --> 02:01:59,760
I'm watching the show buying the toys

750
02:02:00,279 --> 02:02:26,880
Going to Power Ranger con and buying tickets for every panel. See if ghosts had a comic con panels

751
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:35,930
I would probably believe more your theory of Power Rangers aren't real but ghosts aren't either then or something

752
02:02:35,930 --> 02:02:56,479
I don't know. Do you believe in aliens that one's tougher because on one hand?

753
02:02:56,479 --> 02:03:01,630
Yes, I do

754
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:07,600
Do I think that there is somewhere some a galaxy or something that has sentient life? Probably

755
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:09,840
I mean if we exist then other people could exist too

756
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:18,939
I follow by the we exist therefore theory if it happened once it can happen again

757
02:03:18,939 --> 02:03:48,939
I don't know exactly how accurate that is, but you never know. I'm speedrunning trust me

758
02:03:48,979 --> 02:03:58,140
But you don't want these down here. Yeah, you do. Okay

759
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:15,970
I'm just trying to get to the big big house as fast as I can. I want to do my own work

760
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:23,149
I don't want to work or someone else to do. I know I want to do my own work. It's close

761
02:04:23,149 --> 02:04:23,710
All right

762
02:04:23,710 --> 02:04:47,859
What room has not even been touched yet right here some work is the universe where you work a nine-to-five and you aren't insane

763
02:04:47,859 --> 02:05:34,250
What do you think I'm insane you are? Yeah, say that to me in real life and I'll run bro. I'm running almost there

764
02:05:43,079 --> 02:05:47,789
Now you said to me. I'm the coward

765
02:05:47,789 --> 02:06:03,000
I I'm the guy and then beauty the beast that hides behind Gaston. I actually don't hate this room

766
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:14,939
Even though it sucks. Oh my god. Look at how depressing this is for me. Just hold on. Whoa, just think one day

767
02:06:14,939 --> 02:06:19,909
Germa won't be popular. He'll just be another old guy in the supermarket

768
02:06:19,949 --> 02:06:26,380
We might not even recognize him in the future. Holy shit Wow

769
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:46,340
That is that's a sad I just got like a weird image of me pushing a super like a cart

770
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:56,609
We get old just kind of looking at the sails and stuff and being like well

771
02:06:56,609 --> 02:07:09,579
that's that's all those grapes are on sale and then I get to the counter and I'm just like

772
02:07:10,819 --> 02:07:28,319
And my teeth like both my dentures fell out excuse me, we're almost there

773
02:07:28,319 --> 02:07:31,640
I bet you the big house is next and I can't wait

774
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:44,680
What about in? All right. Yeah, I'll do this. She's got a paint after painting these walls. It should be good

775
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:59,369
Don't stop this is wicked sad. I know I'm this is sad and sad music playing too

776
02:07:59,369 --> 02:08:12,520
Don't you see me holding the grapes which stringy hair with this music and on the front of the package

777
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:19,170
It's some motto. It's like and look at me. I guarantee these are freshest grapes

778
02:08:19,170 --> 02:08:24,779
You'll ever see that's me holding and I smile a little bit and I look at me. Yeah. Yeah

779
02:08:39,449 --> 02:08:52,170
Alright, this is actually kind of sad. I'm not gonna do this anymore. This is sad. No more of this. I'm crying

780
02:08:52,170 --> 02:09:20,810
Don't cry almost at that threshold. Come on Gwyn. Let's see it. Come on. We'll be that old in 25 years

781
02:09:21,170 --> 02:09:27,390
Yeah, 24 years is a long time. That's a long time

782
02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:37,800
Think about years of your life and how much of it you've lived but how much of it have you actually lived how much

783
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:43,779
Have you truly been a sentient person that had decision-making skills?

784
02:09:43,779 --> 02:09:52,960
I think under 10 years old you don't even know like you don't even really know you're a person under 5

785
02:09:53,239 --> 02:09:59,859
Right, you don't really start making like actual kind of memories that you hold on to till you're over 5 to 10 years old

786
02:09:59,859 --> 02:10:03,359
So your first 10 years you barely even have lived it

787
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:15,560
So I think about going from like 10 did like 15 10 to 20 15 to 30 and then like 30 to like 80

788
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:34,710
You've got a very long time of being like a sentient person and forget about all the other times sleeping

789
02:10:34,710 --> 02:10:47,310
Yeah, but you need that you need that to live at what point do you stop being sentient?

790
02:10:47,310 --> 02:10:56,859
I mean like what brain activity right continues?

791
02:10:58,159 --> 02:11:08,640
What's the theory there? It kind of freaks me out. It's like your brain still has electrical impulse like activity after you you pass away

792
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:15,569
Doesn't it? So what it happens there because your brain slows down. Do you like live for like a

793
02:11:16,090 --> 02:11:22,100
Hundred million years or something like in your slowed down slow low electrical impulse brain

794
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:42,489
So nobody knows that only lasts a couple hours. Well, that only lasts a couple hours to you

795
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:52,149
What does that feel like because think about it when you dream you only dream for like five seconds, right?

796
02:11:52,329 --> 02:12:02,229
But sometimes those dreams feel like you're there for an hour or two. Oh, that's the freaks me out to a point

797
02:12:02,229 --> 02:12:06,119
Well, like I kind of like the second that I'm dead

798
02:12:06,909 --> 02:12:10,189
Smash my head with a cinder block crush my head with a cinder block

799
02:12:10,189 --> 02:12:14,250
I don't want to like live for an eternity in my own weird like electrical impulse brain thing

800
02:12:18,159 --> 02:12:20,279
Because like what if they do what if they're too cool?

801
02:12:20,279 --> 02:12:27,800
What if okay in the ten seconds that it takes with like uncle Gary to come up with the cinder block and just crush my head

802
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:34,199
I may have lived for a hundred thousand years already in my slowed down electrical impulse kind of

803
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:50,260
Passing brain not to mention uncle Gary the people in there, you know, I've only told uncle Gary

804
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:52,220
I told this to me uncle Gary

805
02:12:52,220 --> 02:12:57,340
Make sure would I die make sure I die the second that I have flatline you smash my head with a cinder block Gary

806
02:12:57,420 --> 02:13:08,840
What are the doctors like? What are you doing? Put that down. That's another hundred thousand years. Yeah, I gotta do this

807
02:13:08,939 --> 02:13:18,800
What if Gary doesn't finish the job?

808
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:30,979
I might live for 500 million years and I'll be sitting there after year number a million

809
02:13:30,979 --> 02:13:36,569
I'm gonna be like, I don't I don't know what happened. Gary didn't fucking finish the job apparently

810
02:13:36,609 --> 02:13:45,359
Well, Gary picks up the cinder block and like throws it and then it hits me like the groin

811
02:13:45,359 --> 02:14:16,340
And it didn't even get the job done and they like they throw them out. Just enjoy eternity. It's a weird thought though

812
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:29,020
It really is everywhere at the end of time. I'm so close to being completed here

813
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:39,159
What what does house flipper do this to you do just paint the walls because okay, I go off

814
02:14:39,159 --> 02:14:41,840
I pop the fuck off and I play house flipper. You know why?

815
02:14:42,439 --> 02:14:44,760
Because it's one of the only times when my brain

816
02:14:45,239 --> 02:14:50,199
Gets to this is just a background thing going on and it is occupying

817
02:14:50,439 --> 02:14:54,079
It's occupying the part of my brain, right?

818
02:14:54,079 --> 02:15:00,439
it's almost like my like the crazy part of my brain now can come out because the part that's that's keeping the

819
02:15:00,840 --> 02:15:04,520
crazy Gary in there is now being occupied painting walls and

820
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:24,260
That's usually the defense please. Oh, right. I did. That's all right

821
02:15:35,279 --> 02:15:38,319
Just can you imagine?

822
02:15:38,319 --> 02:15:40,840
Okay, and here it there he drove there he goes

823
02:15:40,840 --> 02:15:47,359
He's passed and like somebody's picks up a cinder block from behind like the table and it's just like holy shit, bro

824
02:15:51,659 --> 02:16:02,149
Images insane. Oh, you don't understand. He told me he didn't want to stay stuck in a DMT flooded brain chemical dream

825
02:16:02,149 --> 02:16:04,149
I had to

826
02:16:04,250 --> 02:16:11,130
Look, I have it in writing. I sign it with like a blue Crayola crayon

827
02:16:11,770 --> 02:16:33,319
Alright, what do you got? Just opened up another job. Is it in big house? Oh, come on. Where is it?

828
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:42,590
What is this crayon?

829
02:16:43,069 --> 02:17:25,399
Dnr it's supposed to be three jobs here. Why can't I move? I'm an idiot. Where are these other missions the arrows?

830
02:17:25,639 --> 02:17:33,159
Yeah, but I I see this one. I see this one this one here. So where's three is one two

831
02:17:33,159 --> 02:18:04,420
I did that one one two a warehouse for memories. Oh, look at some of these. This is cool

832
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:08,200
Hey, this is now I don't want to be done on do this one

833
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:16,950
I want to unlock the mansion do the boathouse the boathouse is all I do

834
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:33,159
I can't even afford it. How much coke did you snort before this stream worsty? I do not do drugs that are not

835
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:36,760
cannabis or

836
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:43,420
Alcohol that up. All right. Let me just do one more job. I'll make a little bit

837
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:49,579
I need to make I'm not buying this stupid boat though, man. Let me do the apartment one

838
02:18:49,579 --> 02:19:11,190
I feel like it's gonna be easy. I'm not buying the boat that boats boring my schedule Seth Rogen

839
02:19:12,860 --> 02:19:19,000
I'm realizing right now that my Homer Simpson impression is just my Seth Rogen impression. Let's go listen to it

840
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:20,319
There's like a thousand clips

841
02:19:20,319 --> 02:19:27,860
The helicopter is waiting and its engines are still hot. This place looks unacceptable

842
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:34,350
You need to clean it thoroughly for furnishings pick something stylish top class

843
02:19:34,950 --> 02:19:41,549
Money is not an issue. Are we clear? We're clear. I need a room for my suits and ties

844
02:19:41,549 --> 02:19:48,549
I want you to turn this area into a spacious wardrobe. I've left specific instructions in our contract

845
02:19:48,549 --> 02:19:52,389
I'll pay you when you deliver your side of the agreement ways. This must be

846
02:19:58,549 --> 02:20:01,469
What I trust my secret will be safe

847
02:20:02,110 --> 02:20:10,200
All right, I'm taking the wall down and taking the door off. I'm gonna paint arrows on the ground

848
02:20:10,399 --> 02:20:35,739
I'm sprinting to the secret room. What's in it? Why is everybody such a dirty motherfucker? I'll change it out

849
02:20:35,739 --> 02:20:39,479
Yeah, I'll change up the music. Give me a sec. I'll change music

850
02:20:39,479 --> 02:20:59,120
What do you want to put on something that's not gonna get this entire VOD muted, please do chrono trigger

851
02:21:06,469 --> 02:21:11,360
About the block OST, that's a classic one. I'll put that on

852
02:21:32,780 --> 02:21:52,409
Okay, it's like song is too good. It's distracting me. I love this SNES guitar sounds hold on

853
02:21:52,409 --> 02:21:54,409
I need to listen to this and focus

854
02:21:57,329 --> 02:22:01,540
You want to hear my favorite version of the SNES guitar sound

855
02:22:01,940 --> 02:22:31,200
Let me put that on first. Here's my favorite version of what I'm describing. See who catches it. What is it? Turn it up

856
02:22:33,190 --> 02:22:35,879
Mm-hmm

857
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:56,829
Send it nobody's got it

858
02:22:58,770 --> 02:23:03,360
Really? Yeah

859
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:45,069
There it is

860
02:23:48,569 --> 02:23:50,250
Killing it on stage

861
02:23:50,290 --> 02:24:02,069
What a secret room I will I will I will I will

862
02:24:09,489 --> 02:24:22,719
Hey, I saw you at PAX East one year

863
02:24:22,719 --> 02:24:26,559
I was the one jumping up and down shouting your name not asking if you remember but I'm letting you know that I

864
02:24:26,559 --> 02:24:33,989
Remember you being a chill dude. We were on the balcony. I remember walking into PAX East and

865
02:24:35,790 --> 02:24:40,559
From the balcony. I had just gotten there. I wasn't really that popular or anything

866
02:24:40,559 --> 02:24:46,840
I remember walking into the front door and somebody just going

867
02:24:47,239 --> 02:24:48,709
From

868
02:24:48,709 --> 02:24:57,299
From the balcony up at the convention center and I just was like hi

869
02:24:57,299 --> 02:25:02,309
I think the channel what that was I wasn't that popular back then

870
02:25:02,610 --> 02:25:08,680
It was terrifying not terrifying that you did it but terrifying that somebody recognized me

871
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:11,280
I was like, oh my how did that happen that I that's not possible

872
02:25:13,219 --> 02:25:18,020
Terrifying like holy shit, dude, you are terrifying. No, like it was I was terrifying to me

873
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:20,979
I couldn't believe that somebody had recognized me

874
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:41,840

I'm almost done with the front at least treasure is basically dead

1022
03:02:20,909 --> 03:02:22,190
That's sad

1023
03:02:22,190 --> 03:02:47,850
You ever been to another country? I have not well just Canada count. I don't I don't count Canada. I just don't here comes

1024
03:02:48,370 --> 03:03:06,030
Here it comes. I'm to New Zealand. I'm not just gonna go to New Zealand. Just for no reason

1025
03:03:06,790 --> 03:03:12,170
New Zealand I'm sure is a beautiful place

1026
03:03:12,850 --> 03:03:27,219
That's too far for me to go. All right front yard looks pretty good. I

1027
03:03:27,940 --> 03:03:43,629
Would say so get out of your hobbit hole. Oh, it's warm and this grape jam Gandalf

1028
03:03:43,629 --> 03:03:54,930
I just want my books and my grape jam and my comfortable chair Gandalf. That's true

1029
03:03:55,450 --> 03:04:18,649
Now it's a little loud. Let me fix that. I got you need to come to your senses

1030
03:04:19,229 --> 03:04:22,489
This tree can stay

1031
03:04:22,489 --> 03:04:36,899
Come to Riven dare isn't that like Jughead Jones? All right, we're mode

1032
03:04:37,659 --> 03:05:04,659
Clean. No, we're not. Let's be perfect. You missed an inch wide strip. Who cares?

1033
03:05:04,659 --> 03:05:11,909
I've got a lot of internal work inside the castle to do the outside. I don't really care about

1034
03:05:11,909 --> 03:05:23,409
I just don't want to be look gross. You tell me right here. All right, you know the sledgehammer

1035
03:05:23,409 --> 03:05:34,610
I need to take down so what can you go upstairs into a theater? It was an Edgar Allan Poe or something

1036
03:05:34,649 --> 03:05:46,409
All right, what's up here if I take this wall down much outdoor space here to all this shit

1037
03:05:46,409 --> 03:05:57,700
Oh Gandalf my books. You don't need these anymore

1038
03:06:00,870 --> 03:06:02,110
Gandalf

1039
03:06:02,110 --> 03:06:05,950
All right, old people

1040
03:06:05,950 --> 03:06:09,729
You'll be dead in a few years. Oh

1041
03:06:22,899 --> 03:06:24,540
oh

1042
03:06:24,540 --> 03:06:51,299
Cigarette stains. This is we're gonna turn this around just you wait and see if you come up the stairs here

1043
03:06:51,299 --> 03:07:18,870
What is the whole of the steps we're selling that's not inviting we don't talk about how Gandalf was 80% sure that Bilbo was

1044
03:07:18,870 --> 03:07:20,229
dead on that journey

1045
03:07:20,229 --> 03:07:37,510
Didn't get enough just like smoke a bunch of crack and think that it was a good idea to send a hobbit into Mount

1046
03:07:37,510 --> 03:07:42,700
Doom it just worked somehow like lightning strikes once in a million chance, right?

1047
03:07:42,700 --> 03:07:50,350
I think Gandalf just got lucky. It's remarkable that that worked out

1048
03:07:50,709 --> 03:08:09,620
They even make a point to show Gandalf smoke a bunch of crack like smoke a pipe on camera

1049
03:08:09,659 --> 03:08:27,299
50 times and he sits back and it's like eyes like roll forward and he's just like, oh that scared me

1050
03:08:27,299 --> 03:08:35,129
I was like, oh yawn yawn. What's going this music sucks yawn

1051
03:08:35,870 --> 03:09:14,889
Here comes. All right. I'm I'm taking I think I'm gonna take this wall. Maybe not

1052
03:09:14,889 --> 03:09:23,799
I'm gonna play this game one day on stream. I

1053
03:09:24,690 --> 03:09:26,690
Will I've done it?

1054
03:09:32,290 --> 03:09:34,969
Paging paging everybody that works on the switch

1055
03:09:36,090 --> 03:09:40,290
N64 library put this on there

1056
03:09:40,290 --> 03:09:59,940
I don't have any more pogs left in my body to pretend to be excited about paper Mario. I put something else on there

1057
03:10:00,399 --> 03:10:11,229
It's a great game. It's a great game

1058
03:10:11,389 --> 03:10:22,799
It is it could be one of the greater games that was released on the console. I'm aware of that

1059
03:10:23,379 --> 03:10:35,729
You know what else I'm aware of corporate greed. That's right. Oh, I thought this is meat on here

1060
03:10:36,350 --> 03:10:43,940
Just it's gonna be the concession hall

1061
03:10:47,989 --> 03:10:50,940
You gave into that greed

1062
03:10:53,319 --> 03:11:10,280
Don't say that

1063
03:11:10,600 --> 03:11:40,690
Yeah, this is good shit. What soundtrack is this is mischief makers

1064
03:11:41,370 --> 03:12:00,750
Give it a listen. Go play the game if you can. This is ugly. No get rid of that. What's down here?

1065
03:12:00,750 --> 03:12:12,780
I'm not a person down here, right? Oh

1066
03:12:18,469 --> 03:12:20,469
What did that just make me feel so weird?

1067
03:12:20,829 --> 03:12:24,770
Why is it? Why is it in those weird? I don't like that

1068
03:12:25,370 --> 03:13:04,170
You're to all this this whole wall done get rid of the whole thing. Oh, here's my favorite song take this down to

1069
03:13:04,649 --> 03:13:07,280
And I not go outside

1070
03:13:08,120 --> 03:13:22,200
It's gonna be somebody buried in the wall probably

1071
03:13:22,920 --> 03:13:44,440
Let us keep the horror. It's here on the screen right now all the characters in the game too when you attack them they go

1072
03:13:46,950 --> 03:14:17,479
Okay, it looks good sell everything please help what what's wrong nobody said, please help what am I helping?

1073
03:14:17,479 --> 03:14:35,680
What did you do? What happened? He's not making money doing this, you know, it's statistically possible that somebody may have died right now

1074
03:14:36,079 --> 03:15:02,739
Don't tell me that maybe this could be the theater. I need a big open space

1075
03:15:03,059 --> 03:15:25,040
This is the wall to the outside of the property. You have many viewers

1076
03:15:25,680 --> 03:15:43,469
Thanks, is that a compliment or you mean? I mean if you want to talk about statistics

1077
03:15:43,469 --> 03:15:50,100
I would say if there's like a zero point zero zero zero one percent chance that somebody watching

1078
03:15:50,620 --> 03:15:57,360
You know, it could fall into that category. How many people are actually taking going to the bathroom right now?

1079
03:15:58,040 --> 03:16:08,770
Like they're on the toilet and they're holding like their phone in one hand. I gotta brighten this up a little bit

1080
03:16:08,770 --> 03:16:16,200
This is so ugly. I can't do anything with this space yet

1081
03:16:16,719 --> 03:16:19,629
Remind me it. Oh, I could I could put a bathroom right here. Oh

1082
03:16:21,170 --> 03:16:32,000
No, I could this could be the bathroom. Yeah, I think that's a good place for the restroom

1083
03:16:32,280 --> 03:16:46,440
It's also just am I gonna read what you said because I can put them against the wall. All right, let's let's start

1084
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:54,340
Let's start the bathroom. I'm looking for floor. I want bathroom floor

1085
03:16:54,899 --> 03:16:59,440
floor tiles, oh

1086
03:17:02,069 --> 03:17:03,840
How about oh

1087
03:17:03,840 --> 03:17:11,989
No too much. How about these? I like it. Oh

1088
03:17:14,430 --> 03:17:38,799
This is gonna be a nice bathroom gonna be this the all the way through though. What the hell is in a public bathroom?

1089
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:43,719
stalls

1090
03:17:43,719 --> 03:17:45,860
urinals

1091
03:17:45,860 --> 03:18:07,920
Sinks, maybe I should change it out halfway through here. Okay, which I need the walls to be different looking to

1092
03:18:08,479 --> 03:18:25,049
See the bathroom walls look like let me finish this first. It's literally $50 to do this. Who cares?

1093
03:18:25,049 --> 03:18:27,049
I can replace it if I want to

1094
03:18:27,290 --> 03:18:58,270
Do we have a consensus? How many are on the bathroom right now? All right, the walls need to change walls

1095
03:18:58,790 --> 03:19:06,489
Need bathroom walls wall tiles. Maybe some green some blue

1096
03:19:07,069 --> 03:19:13,069
Something that'll brighten up a little bit. This looks all right. Oh

1097
03:19:17,440 --> 03:19:22,360
What about the diamond tiles or these?

1098
03:19:23,360 --> 03:19:40,799
Let me see. Let's see what they look like. I hate that

1099
03:19:41,280 --> 03:20:03,479
Yeah, that looks awful. Just paint it. I'm gonna paint it. Just paint just paint. All right

1100
03:20:03,479 --> 03:20:27,909
I'm thinking that we'll do crystal. This looks like I need something more chill than this. This is too intense

1101
03:20:27,909 --> 03:20:32,629
What should I put on? There's 240 people

1102
03:20:33,469 --> 03:20:44,670
Right now that's so weird think about how many people

1103
03:20:45,350 --> 03:20:55,090
240 is how many people can fit in a movie theater? How many seats are in like an IMAX theater?

1104
03:21:02,040 --> 03:21:12,940
300 240. Yeah, imagine an entire IMAX theater full of people and you you know, they're all going to the bathroom right now

1105
03:21:12,959 --> 03:21:30,829
I'm gonna dress it up. Don't worry. That's gonna get this gaudy wallpaper off. I haven't peed all day either

1106
03:21:30,829 --> 03:21:49,440
So let's do that as well. This is not the main event. I'm just making the bathroom first. So don't forget it

1107
03:21:49,440 --> 03:27:04,110
All right, I'll be right back. I'm gonna go pee back in like two three minutes. Hello

1108
03:27:04,629 --> 03:27:09,170
So I was just downstairs and

1109
03:27:12,170 --> 03:27:19,850
I was walking and I heard a little ruffling. I heard like a little

1110
03:27:21,209 --> 03:27:23,639
What was that?

1111
03:27:23,639 --> 03:27:28,250
All of a sudden I get this wave of baked dog cookies

1112
03:27:28,530 --> 03:27:38,860
Those that savory like baked dog cookies just filled the air. I said, where is he?

1113
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:47,020
I have no idea. I'm looking around like I get I where it's like somebody lit a

1114
03:27:47,420 --> 03:27:55,079
Savory dog candle down here. I don't know. I can't find him. I look over where he usually is

1115
03:27:55,079 --> 03:28:02,329
I look over in the corner and on his bed. No, look at the couch. There's nothing there

1116
03:28:02,329 --> 03:28:04,690
There's just a really really spun up

1117
03:28:05,440 --> 03:28:12,540
Crumpled up blanket that was on the couch and I go over it. Nobody wait a minute that it's dog shaped

1118
03:28:12,540 --> 03:28:19,700
I go over there and they wait it's I'm sitting right in front of where the smell is

1119
03:28:19,819 --> 03:28:26,389
He has wrapped himself up so much isn't been a blanket. I can't even tell there's a dog on the couch

1120
03:28:26,469 --> 03:28:35,180
I'm telling you it hit me in the face when I was far away from him

1121
03:28:35,319 --> 03:28:41,610
He's a little dog, but he has a big dog smell

1122
03:28:41,770 --> 03:28:48,520
It's so cute and then he let out this huge once he realized that I was in the room

1123
03:28:48,579 --> 03:28:54,549
He let out this just like you know what I'm talking about, right?

1124
03:28:54,770 --> 03:29:03,159
Yeah, he's so wonderful. Give him a bath. I he gets a bath all the time

1125
03:29:03,319 --> 03:29:18,290
He is very thoroughly cleaned on a very regular basis. All right, let's keep going Jerma

1131
03:30:43,440 --> 03:30:49,319
You're not a real competitor your flow is so slow can't even keep tempo when it comes to delivering mediocre streams

1132
03:30:49,559 --> 03:30:52,000
You're so far on top. You're gonna forget vertigo

1133
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:57,520
I thought you let the react any stuff on YouTube your IQ is so high can't suffer one by one Rubik's Cube

The rhymes are on point here you get to read you get to write them

1168
03:37:00,120 --> 03:37:15,420
I have to come up with it so much slower than you do. Do I have to do this? What? Hey

03:37:16,940 --> 03:37:22,159
Listen to me. You got no job streaming ain't work. Your paychecks like your height man

1171
03:37:27,479 --> 03:37:48,010
You're psycho and smelly. I'll call you a rat, but never have I seen a rodent so fucking fat. That was good

1172
03:38:02,280 --> 03:38:04,649
Okay, whoa

Just cope be smelling like a fart cloud German talking with his mouth too loud two foot too tall and never getting higher

1175
03:38:18,180 --> 03:38:34,610
Vocal cords sound like a swirling tire when I play house flipper. I think I

1176
03:38:35,510 --> 03:38:49,920
Gives me drugs. I don't know why I was making a bathroom

1177
03:38:49,920 --> 03:39:04,309
That's the last thing I remember sliding in the cringe streams when vids of the year were voted on recently

1178
03:39:04,309 --> 03:39:20,319
Yeah, I am invincible. I am unstoppable turn on auto-tune. Oh boy

1179
03:39:20,319 --> 03:39:24,299
You guys are fucking gonna derail this whole thing. Aren't you?

1180
03:39:25,760 --> 03:39:37,620
Hold on. Give me a second. Hello. Hello. Hello

1181
03:39:38,500 --> 03:39:40,110
Oh

1182
03:39:40,110 --> 03:39:44,829
Is it on? Oh shit. It's not even on fuck. I didn't even turn it on

1183
03:39:52,450 --> 03:40:00,530
That was really bad, I thought it was on I thought I was safe I thought I was so safe

1184
03:40:01,639 --> 03:40:18,600
Okay, here we go. Oh opster has another one. Okay, this is it after this cuz I'm we have to have to play the game

1185
03:40:19,000 --> 03:40:28,379
Before everybody leaves the like 14 of us to think this is funny. We'll stick around. All right, here we go

1186
03:40:29,530 --> 03:40:41,819
Last one it needs to be

1187
03:40:41,860 --> 03:41:03,489
It's gonna sound so weird. Okay. How about this one? This is officers response. I got a new monitor. So my shit

1188
03:41:03,489 --> 03:41:11,229
I can't really read it that well because everything is so small on the screen. So it's actually kind of hard for me to read it

1189
03:41:11,790 --> 03:41:17,799
I'm at like 144 P. No 114 40 P

1190
03:41:17,799 --> 03:41:26,159
Oh gee German the Worma cuz he's slimy. He calls his crew the Boston Beatles more like the Boston Ladybugs

1191
03:41:26,879 --> 03:41:28,879

1193
03:41:35,379 --> 03:41:38,719

1194
03:41:38,719 --> 03:41:42,959
He's too hot would send him into his deathbed can't rap much longer ain't got the character count

1195
03:41:42,959 --> 03:41:45,920
But when it comes to rap battle victors, I don't think there's any doubt

1196
03:41:54,600 --> 03:42:10,479
Don't do that. I wonder how long would it take to be able to realize there was an auto-tune on you think like these people coming

1197
03:42:10,479 --> 03:42:17,709
To the stream. Okay, I'm gonna laugh and freak somebody out. Why does this sound so weird?

1198
03:42:17,790 --> 03:42:31,989
Does this sound weird you guys do the Tasman auto-tune the test? Oh my god

1199
03:42:32,750 --> 03:42:35,829
Okay, this is gonna put me out. This is it. Oh

This is the Tasmanian devil in the electric chair, okay, this is not doesn't sound right at all

People I'm gonna be known as the fucking guy that's on drugs every stream and I don't even do them

1215
03:45:49,299 --> 03:45:52,579
So we're done after this and how many times have I done this where I go?

1216

He really think his bar is all that but it sounds worse than a shitting rat his height dented got hit with a bat

1222
03:46:45,659 --> 03:46:51,819

1229
03:48:59,399 --> 03:49:06,680
I'm reading this one. This one is held by auto mod for bullying. Let's go

1230
03:49:58,079 --> 03:50:01,780
Kind of goofy

1231
03:50:02,739 --> 03:50:13,100
This one's like not even good it was held by auto mod for being bullying

1232
03:50:19,790 --> 03:50:51,659
Okay, here we go

1233
03:51:03,110 --> 03:51:51,430
You really get into these it's kind of fun who won who's next I don't know

1234
03:51:51,590 --> 03:51:57,250
This is what Jerma does to his friends on discord

1235
03:51:58,170 --> 03:52:04,870
Really does feel like that doesn't it get Freddy get Freddy to write something

1236
03:52:08,260 --> 03:52:12,850
Freddy if Freddy writes me a saw rap, I will do it

1237
03:52:12,850 --> 03:52:20,569
I I will do it in the saw voice. No pressure on Freddy

1238
03:52:20,569 --> 03:52:25,149
By the way, Freddy if you're like, no, I don't want to fucking do that Freddy. You write like a saw rap

1239
03:52:25,149 --> 03:52:35,969
I'll do it and I will release it on stream. You just ruined Freddy's DMS

1240
03:52:36,969 --> 03:53:00,870
No, turn off your DMS Freddy Freddy go private for like a week and then we'll talk post it to the main channel

1241
03:53:00,870 --> 03:53:14,319
No, nothing's to go into the main channel ever again. It has to be a music video

1242
03:53:14,959 --> 03:53:17,950
No, I can't do a music video

1243
03:53:18,590 --> 03:53:23,069
Yeah, January and February is gonna be so busy. I I can't oh

1244
03:53:35,979 --> 03:53:37,540
This is awful

1245
03:53:37,540 --> 03:53:50,639
Okay, I gotta turn the volume back up and we have to put on just some music just regular just kind of hangout music

1246
03:53:50,680 --> 03:53:59,799
No more freestyles. Okay. I'm gonna put like Animal Crossing

1247
03:54:01,209 --> 03:54:18,250
New leaf OST we got to come down from that. That's too. That was too much. I gotta relax held for auto mod for bullying

1248
03:54:18,250 --> 03:54:21,250
That's the like. Oh, yeah, send me your diss tracks

1249
03:54:21,989 --> 03:54:25,469
Excuse me. Don't bully the streamer. That's so funny

1250
03:54:27,780 --> 03:54:55,399
Well, at least I know it works. I'm not gonna put the music on times to speed just okay

1251
03:54:55,440 --> 03:55:03,459
Here's what you can do wait 20 minutes go open up the VOD and then watch this part in times to speed

1252
03:55:03,659 --> 03:55:20,370
You need to talk in half speed to match. Oh, come on

1253
03:55:20,370 --> 03:55:25,209
Don't give me more stupid routines to do now. I have to do this

1254
03:55:26,959 --> 03:55:38,979
So I was thinking of putting white up on the background here

1255
03:55:39,700 --> 03:55:40,819
and

1256
03:55:40,860 --> 03:55:46,100
You guys tell me if you think it's a good enough color

1257
03:55:46,219 --> 03:55:52,040
I think it's gonna look really nice

1258
03:55:53,260 --> 03:55:59,639
Maybe eventually we can put some

1259
03:56:01,020 --> 03:56:03,420
paintings up on the walls. I

1260
03:56:06,090 --> 03:56:09,010
Think that will come out good

1261
03:56:10,010 --> 03:56:20,420
Up stairs, however, I think we have to do something a little more

1262
03:56:21,659 --> 03:56:26,399
elaborate maybe a

1263
03:56:27,280 --> 03:56:32,079
couple of chairs here on either side

1264
03:56:33,959 --> 03:56:44,690
But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here? Oh

1265
03:56:49,489 --> 03:56:50,690
Oh

1266
03:56:50,690 --> 03:56:53,729
This is not the chair

1267
03:56:55,250 --> 03:56:59,360
It's the paint menu

1268
03:57:07,200 --> 03:57:09,940
I

1269
03:57:09,940 --> 03:57:13,350
Think it's over here somewhere

1270
03:57:14,549 --> 03:57:18,120
Let me search for it

1271
03:57:22,059 --> 03:57:24,420
Chai

1272
03:57:24,940 --> 03:57:27,120
I

1273
03:57:27,319 --> 03:57:35,500
That's what I was saying to you earlier

1274
03:57:36,059 --> 03:57:44,569
This one with the green that's gonna look so good here

1275
03:57:50,379 --> 03:57:56,510
Okay, I think I have enough chairs there

1276
03:58:12,680 --> 03:58:16,899
Oh

1277
03:58:17,860 --> 03:58:24,540
Hey, does anybody see the new

1278
03:58:25,299 --> 03:58:37,290
Marvel movie is it any good? Oh wait, I think somebody's texting me

1279
03:58:39,299 --> 03:58:43,280
Feel a sneeze coming on

1280
03:59:01,739 --> 03:59:14,700
All right, all right, I need it clipped given me can somebody do that get that at times two and we I need to watch that right now

1281
03:59:14,700 --> 03:59:17,760
I want to see how close I was. I think I was pretty close

1282
03:59:17,799 --> 03:59:26,290
Can we get that section that like two-minute section there's to see if it was like a full minute of me of normal shit

1283
03:59:26,370 --> 03:59:46,000
You're a psycho. That's fine. You got the whole thing and I do this in times two. Okay speed times two

1284
03:59:48,149 --> 03:59:50,149
upstairs, however, I

1285
03:59:50,309 --> 03:59:53,059
Got it think it works

1286
03:59:53,340 --> 04:00:10,340
Think it works. Hold on. We got it. We got to confirm that this works. All right, it's time

1287
04:00:10,340 --> 04:00:27,120
I think I did a pretty good job that will okay. Let's see how I did that will come out good

1288
04:00:29,219 --> 04:00:33,659
Upstairs, however, I think we have to do something a little more elaborate

1289
04:00:34,180 --> 04:00:39,100
Maybe a couple of chairs here on either side

1290
04:00:39,579 --> 04:00:44,979
But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here? Oh

1291
04:00:47,620 --> 04:00:52,260
This is not the chairs, it's the paint menu

1292
04:00:56,909 --> 04:00:58,909
I

1293
04:00:58,950 --> 04:01:03,069
Think it needs to be a little faster. I think it needs to be like two and a half or three

1294
04:01:03,069 --> 04:01:12,940
I need to see the three sounds like an AI generated voice. I need to see this at three

1295
04:01:13,940 --> 04:01:18,340
Upstairs, however, I alright somebody clip this. No. No, I need the whole thing

1296
04:01:18,500 --> 04:01:36,280
I need the whole thing. I need I need it at times three. Wait, hold on kid. It's too long

1297
04:01:36,680 --> 04:01:42,090
Clip this one and just do alright. Alright, get did you get that? Give it to me

1298
04:01:42,329 --> 04:01:53,180
Give me that what just happened right there and I'm gonna do times one make this. Okay. Here we go

1299
04:01:53,219 --> 04:01:59,239
Let me open this one because this would be times two. There's here on either side

1300
04:01:59,760 --> 04:02:08,750
Okay, so now let's do times times two on this one chairs here on either side. Oh my god. This is fucked

1301
04:02:08,790 --> 04:02:11,610
Okay, this is perfect. I

1302
04:02:11,770 --> 04:02:33,899
Eventually want this whole thing. This is now times four that will come out chairs here. Oh my god, dude

1303
04:02:33,899 --> 04:02:36,040
Are you kidding me? Okay times two

1304
04:02:36,739 --> 04:02:48,309
Chairs here on either side chairs here on either side

1305
04:02:48,889 --> 04:02:51,290
But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here? Oh

1306
04:02:52,329 --> 04:02:54,889
This is not the chairs. It's the paint menu

1307
04:02:55,569 --> 04:03:00,510
Okay, that's a little too fast a little bit and needs to be 1.5

1308
04:03:01,049 --> 04:03:04,950
There's here on either side

1309
04:03:05,670 --> 04:03:08,629
But what kind of chairs do you think we should put on here? Oh

1310
04:03:10,270 --> 04:03:13,690
This is not the chairs, it's the paint menu

1311
04:03:16,469 --> 04:03:17,750
I

1312
04:03:17,750 --> 04:03:20,709
Think it needs to be a little faster. What I think it needs to be like two and a half or three

1313
04:03:20,709 --> 04:03:26,200
I'm too fast three. So wait AI generated voice. I

1314
04:03:29,340 --> 04:03:32,180
Want to see the whole thing? It's all right

1315
04:03:32,819 --> 04:03:39,020
See it at three

1316
04:03:40,340 --> 04:03:45,899
That's so stupid nobody all right, somebody download the

1317
04:03:46,700 --> 04:03:56,360
I don't know. It's time to do it in the reverse. Here we go

1318
04:03:57,459 --> 04:04:06,959
Ha ha. I think over here. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Right here. Right here. Here. Here. What should I do?

1319
04:04:06,959 --> 04:04:11,299
I did blue. Should I do this blue this blue right here? Good. Yep

1320
04:04:12,930 --> 04:04:36,659
That's not gonna work. It's too hard to go fast speed this one up chairs here on either side. Oh

1321
04:04:36,920 --> 04:04:38,139
Oh

1322
04:04:38,139 --> 04:04:46,450
This is not the chairs. That was so fucked up. Somebody said Vocaloid

1323
04:04:47,110 --> 04:05:00,170
All right. I'm no more derailing. It's time to play. All right, somebody

1324
04:05:00,170 --> 04:05:03,549
I know somebody on the subreddit in like an hour

1325
04:05:04,010 --> 04:05:11,549
We'll have that whole section sped up to the exact preferences that need to be to make it sound normal and then you'll see it

1326
04:05:11,549 --> 04:05:22,610
You'll see it there later in like an hour. I'm looking forward to it. All right

1327
04:05:22,610 --> 04:05:25,250
I just I was down doing the bathroom. I don't even know where the bathroom is

1328
04:05:25,250 --> 04:05:30,239
It was like underground somewhere. Oh, right. Okay. These are not the chairs

1329
04:05:30,920 --> 04:05:40,680
So I'm thinking

1330
04:05:40,680 --> 04:05:51,649
Hells why even do with this place? I was gonna make a theater, but it's the the castles like too big and weird

1331
04:05:51,889 --> 04:06:05,510
It's too it's like there's too many outdoor areas. You know, I mean

1332
04:06:16,200 --> 04:06:22,540
Just make a counter-strike map I

1333
04:06:23,100 --> 04:06:47,819
Made the FPS house already. I know this dude's actually playing the game. I know what happened. It's a user-made sawdust

1334
04:06:48,020 --> 04:06:57,329
All right

1335
04:06:57,329 --> 04:07:04,709
All right. I'll say this is too much. I'll do this later go back to the funny stuff. No more playing games

1336
04:07:04,709 --> 04:07:06,750
No, we can't it can't just all be

1337
04:07:07,629 --> 04:07:25,479
cartoon world

1338
04:07:25,719 --> 04:07:28,719
Oh music though. Yeah, let's put animal crossing back on

1339
04:07:30,239 --> 04:07:33,399
So now what I was thinking

1340
04:07:34,680 --> 04:07:38,159
Was singing you a little song

1341
04:07:47,920 --> 04:07:51,350
I'm done. I'm kidding. I'm kidding relax. I

1342
04:07:55,799 --> 04:08:29,729
Don't like this place. Yeah, I don't like this house. I want another one. What? Here we go. Here we go

1343
04:08:30,010 --> 04:08:52,059
Okay, I got my money back. Yeah, I don't like that place. Let me find no accept the offer. It's fine

1344
04:08:54,920 --> 04:09:00,670
Whoo? Ah

1345
04:09:01,430 --> 04:09:11,100
Whoo and the stream suit my family's making Christmas cookies. We'll go for like an hour or two

1346
04:09:11,459 --> 04:09:18,350
I'll be live in a day or two. Anyways, I'll be laughing Christmas Eve, but no, I'm not done

1347
04:09:18,350 --> 04:09:43,889
I want just one different house. I didn't like that one. I just say fuck it and buy the dumb boat

1348
04:09:43,889 --> 04:09:57,590
What can I even do with it though? I feel like I this might be just like the castle though

1349
04:09:57,590 --> 04:10:09,670
No, we already did the boat. This one was kind of cool

1350
04:10:10,309 --> 04:10:23,819
Yeah, I'm gonna buy this one. I did the moon house last time just make a big bird house

1351
04:10:23,819 --> 04:10:33,850
I did the moon one last time. All right now I'm gonna go for it

1352
04:10:41,200 --> 04:10:54,680
Actually gonna play I'm gonna do a regular house with a theater in the middle

1353
04:10:54,680 --> 04:11:06,520
Or maybe I'll just mow the lawn and then do a rap battle with the chat. I don't know. We'll find out

1354
04:11:06,520 --> 04:11:47,690
This is a nice house that I could decorate this to recreate your own house. I have a verse

1355
04:11:47,690 --> 04:11:56,670
I want you to rap. I'm not doing any more rap destroy your own house with a sledgehammer

1356
04:11:57,190 --> 04:12:07,879
All right. This is mowing speed. So I think this one's good

1357
04:12:08,319 --> 04:12:34,100
I'm going faster make a studio in the house and then just do rap battles in the house

1358
04:12:36,040 --> 04:12:45,229
What the hell are you doing? All right, whatever. Let's clean up. Ah

1359
04:12:46,879 --> 04:13:03,319
Leaning I'm gonna go room by room one by one just make a normal nice house

1360
04:13:03,479 --> 04:13:10,069
Should I actually try to show you guys what I think is a nice house what I think would be good instead of making malls

1361
04:13:10,649 --> 04:13:15,299
Comedy theaters ice cream shops best buys golf courses

1362
04:13:15,659 --> 04:13:21,379
Should I actually try to do a decent house for once in the three plus years? I've been playing this fucking game

1363
04:13:21,379 --> 04:13:58,239
Let's see what I can do. That's on the ground. No, it's a glass girl. Hi. This is the garage front window

1364
04:13:58,239 --> 04:14:00,840
All right, let's just let's let's settle down. Let's relax

1365
04:14:01,639 --> 04:14:07,209
Not the chill section of the stream here. Just relax with me. Take a deep breath

1366
04:14:10,909 --> 04:14:48,610
See don't you feel better what's going on with the ground what happened what happened you're in a really silly mood

1367
04:14:48,610 --> 04:14:59,860
I think that once every six to twelve months or so I let the goblin out and it just

1368
04:15:00,180 --> 04:15:23,819
Happens to coincide with house flipper updates. I give it all this now. Okay, I like this kitchen

1369
04:15:24,260 --> 04:15:50,680
It could use a little bit of work change these windows out. Don't let the goblin out. Ah

1370
04:15:51,200 --> 04:16:02,100
I will if I want to he's a broken. I need to redo this. Oh, right. Okay. Wait, okay

1371
04:16:02,219 --> 04:16:11,459
What TV is going there? So if this was my house? All right

1372
04:16:11,819 --> 04:16:20,159
Open the door a place my keys right here. What are my favorite colors? I want for house

1373
04:16:20,159 --> 04:16:53,149
I got a spray so dirty dad. Hey, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? I got it. There we go

1374
04:16:53,270 --> 04:17:29,079
Where is this other dirt? I don't see it on the ground. Where is it now? Whatever use Oh

1375
04:17:32,059 --> 04:17:46,690
Broken fuse. All right, it's kind of dirty. I clean this. Oh, it's the side entrance

1376
04:17:46,690 --> 04:18:03,680
Okay, find the same shelf that you have. What's your favorite Christmas song? My favorite Christmas song is

1377
04:18:06,780 --> 04:18:09,059
Grandma got run over by a reindeer

1378
04:18:10,629 --> 04:18:17,280
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve. You could say there's no such thing as Santa

1379
04:18:17,639 --> 04:18:43,239
But as for me and grandpa, we believe balcony auto-tune that what about the grandma got run off by a reindeer movie

1380
04:18:43,319 --> 04:19:00,889
Did not know they made a movie the sink has got to go a lot of this stuff's got to go

1381
04:19:02,489 --> 04:19:28,399
Bathroom needs it work. Is there a second floor a little bit of dirt left to get should be good though. Very cool

1382
04:19:28,440 --> 04:19:51,790
They take Santa to court sounds like a wild movie. He's scary for me. That's too scary for me. All right

1383
04:19:51,790 --> 04:19:58,840
I like this upstairs. You got to clean first

1384
04:19:58,840 --> 04:20:11,909
That's the most important thing and you just go one by one room by room and make your dream house

1385
04:20:12,069 --> 04:20:28,760
I've a lot of money

1386
04:20:28,760 --> 04:20:54,840
500,000 nice place this guy up here. I don't like the see-through door too many windows. I said shit

1387
04:20:54,840 --> 04:21:03,200
It's almost 4 a.m. Yeah, I'll be going for like another hour started a little bit late today

1388
04:21:03,200 --> 04:21:21,549
I had some stuff to get situated. Why is somebody saying fuck you chat? Hey, hey, what's your mouth?

1389
04:21:21,670 --> 04:21:54,639
Hey, all right. What room is gonna be my bedroom? Oh, no, where's monster rancher? I uninstalled it

1390
04:21:54,639 --> 04:22:00,309
I got to s-rank and I raged I threw my controller through the window

1391
04:22:01,510 --> 04:22:27,239
Exploded I was it was embarrassing and shitty. I can't get back in the house. No more dirt. I'm here. Come on

1392
04:22:27,239 --> 04:22:37,549
Get that balcony really?

1393
04:22:43,559 --> 04:23:13,879
Looks better. Where is it? It's not even on the map. This house is modernist trash

1394
04:23:22,159 --> 04:23:29,469
modernist trash

1395
04:23:29,469 --> 04:23:32,540
Modernist fucking sucks. No. No you guys with this

1396
04:23:34,639 --> 04:24:05,670
Into home design good. Okay, there's only one more room that I really need to clean this dirty one. Hey nice

1397
04:24:08,729 --> 04:24:19,540
Almost time to redecorate chat sees the new Pringles logo and thinks all modernist art sucks. What's the new Pringles logo?

1398
04:24:19,540 --> 04:24:59,389
What do you mean? What do they do? It's an iPad game. Um, I I mean, it's the new can it took they removed his hair

1399
04:24:59,389 --> 04:25:28,170
I didn't even know he had hair. Hold on. Wait, I didn't he has hair. He does have hair

1400
04:25:28,209 --> 04:25:30,120
All right

1401
04:25:30,120 --> 04:25:42,180
This looks like the episode of the Pringles TV show where he goes back to like the 30s and it's black and white

1402
04:25:42,180 --> 04:25:55,670
I mean who cares

1403
04:25:56,030 --> 04:25:58,250
Care

1404
04:25:58,250 --> 04:26:05,139
There you want my reaction who cares when they change the recipe of Pringles? That's when you'll hear me scream

1405
04:26:05,180 --> 04:26:15,120
They could put they could put clown makeup on him and give him like a big chef's hat

1406
04:26:15,120 --> 04:26:17,280
I don't whatever they taste the same

1407
04:26:17,280 --> 04:26:28,479
I'm just not looking forward if they ever make the Pringles guy a real guy in the commercials

1408
04:26:28,520 --> 04:26:47,069
Be like interesting and funny and shit and it's like a rich guy. I think everything's clean

1409
04:26:47,149 --> 04:26:49,879
I'm gonna go to the living room gonna start living room

1410
04:26:49,879 --> 04:27:00,709
Let's change the stairs to something that is way more tolerable than this. All right. I like a I

1411
04:27:02,649 --> 04:27:11,340
I'm not a big wood guy. I would ruin it. I think it it can be destroyed too easily. I'm like a vinyl

1412
04:27:12,120 --> 04:27:14,280
linoleum tile

1413
04:27:14,280 --> 04:27:32,309
You can just what is expensive and you can fuck it up really easily. Mmm. I don't hate the mahogany

1414
04:27:32,309 --> 04:27:55,549
I don't hate the mahogany and I don't like dark wood. Actually, that's not true. I like um, where's that?

1415
04:27:55,549 --> 04:28:02,950
Where's where's just like the right? All right, that doesn't look bad. This doesn't look bad either. This doesn't look bad

1416
04:28:02,950 --> 04:28:13,750
I'm going with the mahogany. It looks good living room time. What do I want my first of all?

1417
04:28:13,750 --> 04:28:18,709
I gotta get these walls taken care of cuz oh my goodness guys

1418
04:28:19,149 --> 04:28:29,770
What the heck's going on here ain't I like very neutral colors in my living spaces. I'm talking grays

1419
04:28:29,770 --> 04:28:38,790
I'm talking like kind of like olive off white not ever cigarette yellow though

1420
04:28:38,790 --> 04:28:44,479
I don't like a cream yellow. I think it looks like cigarettes like this. No cigarettes

1421
04:28:44,799 --> 04:28:50,909
Steel gray I would like on the wall. Probably. Let me say what it looks like

1422
04:28:50,909 --> 04:29:14,280
I like a neutral living room, although it could be an accent. I have an orange couch. No

1423
04:29:15,440 --> 04:29:17,389
No

1424
04:29:17,389 --> 04:29:26,649
No, it's too neutral. Let me just see what it looks like

1425
04:29:27,229 --> 04:29:46,889
And maybe like a blue. I love Navy really like nautical colors. I like blue white navy

1426
04:29:47,129 --> 04:29:54,600
This is too dark. Excuse me

1427
04:29:55,780 --> 04:30:13,559
Blue is a nice color. Yeah, I'm gonna have look I'll have a navy wall here. Let's try it nautical

1428
04:30:13,559 --> 04:30:30,399
No nonsense do something else recommend dark green. That's not a bad one either. That's a good one

1429
04:30:30,680 --> 04:30:46,620
Let me check this first though now reds too bold royal blue is I think too I'm thinking like a navy blue

1430
04:30:48,040 --> 04:30:49,600
gray fog

1431
04:30:49,600 --> 04:31:21,040
Moody cobalt. Yep, this might be the one live a little I love blue. I just I really like blue a lot

1432
04:31:21,479 --> 04:31:41,840
Now the question is should I just have that be blue I think so. Okay. Yeah, what's wrong with this?

1433
04:31:41,840 --> 04:31:53,590
Look at this is comfortable. You're making a restaurant. I beige. I'll give it a tester

1434
04:31:54,590 --> 04:32:08,870
White wall. These are not white walls. These are I don't remember. It's some kind of gray

1435
04:32:08,870 --> 04:32:30,790
I need to get my lighting in here. It's your dream house not chats. Do it. You want? Yeah

1436
04:32:31,309 --> 04:32:43,420
You want you want bright orange walls? Oh, just get the game. Why do you not have this game in the first place?

1437
04:32:43,420 --> 04:32:48,760
Why do you not have this game in the first place? This game is the most chill game ever that's ever existed

1438
04:32:48,760 --> 04:33:18,099
Oh, it's light. I think it's not wait. Is it on sale doesn't run on your operating system. It doesn't what how much is it?

1439
04:33:18,099 --> 04:33:31,779

1440
04:33:31,779 --> 04:33:38,229
I believe it's part of the winter sale. That's good

1441
04:33:39,979 --> 04:33:45,419
That's pretty good to me

1442
04:33:45,860 --> 04:33:49,110
All right, be careful over here

1443
04:33:49,630 --> 04:34:00,020
Ten bucks on switch to if you can't get it on PC. Oh, that's cool. It's no secret

1444
04:34:00,020 --> 04:34:07,110
This is one of my favorite games on Steam. I don't know if I want to do white over here

1445
04:34:08,470 --> 04:34:21,349
If this is too plain on the sides here, maybe something else here. What do you think? Maybe pistachio green?

1446
04:34:46,979 --> 04:34:59,080
Do I love it the last a little too green little a little too green

1447
04:35:02,470 --> 04:35:07,200

I should put for lamps. It looks good with rugs. Yeah, it should be good lights. I

1462
04:38:54,319 --> 04:39:00,580
Don't like stuff like this too old. I don't hate this but I don't really like the wood

1463
04:39:02,729 --> 04:39:14,090
All this is too extra for me too extra way too extra. Okay, not bad too artsy

1464
04:39:14,090 --> 04:39:23,060
I feel like I have something I have something to prove. I have this the boring

1465
04:39:25,159 --> 04:39:41,639
Generic to streamer maybe no. No too old ugly. No

1466
04:39:43,159 --> 04:39:44,599
Ugly

1467
04:39:44,599 --> 04:39:47,669
Okay, I armin

1468
04:39:49,250 --> 04:39:55,200

1469
04:39:55,479 --> 04:39:59,439
Now I don't want it

1470
04:39:59,439 --> 04:40:10,619
Way to futuristic extra weird shit and that too campy to fake sci-fi

1471
04:40:13,119 --> 04:40:20,450
To fake old sci-fi wedding no

1472
04:40:24,979 --> 04:40:26,979
There we there it is

1473
04:40:28,220 --> 04:40:36,819
There it is finally we made the shit that I think actually looks alright here we made it I like that

1474
04:40:36,819 --> 04:40:58,159
I don't like that ceiling fans. Yeah. Yeah, I don't hate that. Yeah, just do candles

1475
04:40:58,180 --> 04:41:00,180
All right. I'm gonna let's go this. Ooh

1476
04:41:12,029 --> 04:41:27,450
Here I like the gray like the gray this is gonna go right right there

1477
04:41:27,450 --> 04:41:46,560
Oh, look at that. Oh, I like that where it is. I might move it. See. Ooh, I like this too

1478
04:41:48,849 --> 04:42:33,259
Goldner. All right. Now we're talking now we need I need to get a couple more lamps. I hate

1479
04:42:34,139 --> 04:42:38,529
Ceiling fans, you know, I hate ceiling fans because most people that have a ceiling fan

1480
04:42:38,529 --> 04:42:41,930
I mean a lot of people have it fine

1481
04:42:42,090 --> 04:42:48,639
But when a ceiling fan is not mounted completely correctly, it's not maybe screwed in all the way on one side

1482
04:42:49,200 --> 04:42:51,880
When they have that weird

1483
04:42:52,360 --> 04:42:54,759
Wobble it just induces

1484
04:42:55,720 --> 04:43:00,689
Anxiety in my brain. I hate it if it's not perfect

1485
04:43:00,689 --> 04:43:07,380
And I don't like when a ceiling fan spins a lot something about it freaks me out the fact

1486
04:43:07,380 --> 04:43:09,900
If especially if you have a specific ceiling fan and you like, oh, yeah

1487
04:43:09,900 --> 04:43:14,459
I turn the ceiling fan on and this thing is a blender sitting above us on the couch

1488
04:43:14,459 --> 04:43:15,880
I don't know

1489
04:43:15,880 --> 04:43:20,400
I just feel like dude if that thing if it falls it's we're just literally chopped up like a fucking helicopter and like GTA

1490
04:43:20,680 --> 04:43:28,439
Especially when they're on high. This is you look up and you just see this

1491
04:43:28,919 --> 04:43:50,799
Helicopter blade just spinning. I don't like it mounted on the wall like a normal person and not sharp

1492
04:43:51,520 --> 04:44:00,459
It's something about how fast it moves. I don't like fast things. Let me name you some things that I don't like

1493
04:44:00,459 --> 04:44:02,700
I don't like when a car goes fast

1494
04:44:04,909 --> 04:44:21,180
Speeding and shit. I really don't like it anything that goes fast like more than 70 80 miles per hour is like

1495
04:44:21,759 --> 04:44:25,099
No, no, no. No, I don't like when cars go fast

1496
04:44:25,520 --> 04:44:37,759
I don't like the things spin really fast. You laugh at car accidents in video games

1497
04:44:37,759 --> 04:44:51,479
It's geared of ovens cars and fans. I don't like I don't like snakes

1498
04:44:51,479 --> 04:44:55,779
I love snake theoretically on paper as an animal

1499
04:44:55,799 --> 04:44:59,490
But I don't like how fast they are if they want to just be like

1500
04:45:00,509 --> 04:45:04,099
They can just go. It's I don't know what they couldn't move too fast

1501
04:45:05,400 --> 04:45:13,700
Spiders that can like sprint. I just don't like when things move fast. Yeah balloons

1502
04:45:13,900 --> 04:45:20,439
They fill up boom real fast air shoots out bomb like bomb explodes. I don't like it. I hate it

1503
04:45:20,479 --> 04:45:51,189
Okay, what was I doing? Yeah, I need the want the recessed lights anything with a lot of tension or that moves really fast

1504
04:45:51,189 --> 04:45:56,639
I do not like how's this one?

1505
04:45:56,639 --> 04:46:03,330
It's all right. I got a I'm gonna move these because I want to know what I'm gonna make sure I know where the couch is

1506
04:46:03,389 --> 04:46:23,939
You know what I'm saying suck. I'm just like poked a hole in my ceiling. You are a prey animal

1507
04:46:32,099 --> 04:46:38,569
So funny

1508
04:46:42,389 --> 04:46:50,500
Everybody's a lion, right? Oh, I'm a lion. I'm a tiger. I'm a wolf. No, you're not

1509
04:47:03,020 --> 04:47:13,669
Your horse no, you're not. It's 70% of people in this chat are frogs bugs

1510
04:47:16,150 --> 04:47:34,139
Smalls animals like my mice rats goldfish fucking aardvarks monkeys

1511

1512
04:48:04,639 --> 04:48:08,340
I actually feel like a lot of you probably could be a bear like a grizzly bear

1513
04:48:08,340 --> 04:48:18,330
No, you don't want none of you lions lions the guy with the fucking ear pods on just blasting music in the gym

1514
04:48:18,490 --> 04:48:40,979
Like, you know, we're not we're not lions here. They look lizards. Yep. Oh, yeah

1515
04:48:40,979 --> 04:48:50,150
There's probably a lot of lizards here. Are we a lot of snakes was it looking up? Oh, yeah lights

1516
04:48:50,150 --> 04:49:00,310
I think some of you probably are lions. Some of you are probably tigers. These were my hyenas here than anything else

1517
04:49:00,470 --> 04:49:19,139
Why am I under doors lights? Okay, please ceiling. There we go. Just wanted to be I don't want anything fancy

Look at that. Most of you are sheep. No, I don't believe that

1520
04:49:49,099 --> 04:50:00,029
I actually think they're probably more there are probably more anteaters here than sheeps really believe I think so

1521
04:50:00,029 --> 04:50:16,340
Let's get some furniture. No brick. I just think of bread

1522
04:50:16,340 --> 04:50:29,659
This looks like it hurts to sit on so it's like a coffin. This is a coffin. No, no

1523
04:50:29,659 --> 04:50:40,779
I like this one because it's like I don't know the couch is there another now

1526
04:51:16,459 --> 04:51:35,919
Too elaborate too many holes big too fancy weird a bed. Eh, uh

1527

1528
04:51:45,259 --> 04:51:54,419
It's kind of weird a big corner. All right, what color do I want? It's comfy

1529
04:51:54,419 --> 04:52:09,159
I like black couch or a darker couch a lady. Oh

1535
04:53:07,599 --> 04:53:27,389

1537
04:53:33,729 --> 04:53:38,220
Nope, nothing you can say that's gonna change my mind. Well, what do you think? Do you think it's okay?

1538
04:53:38,340 --> 04:54:12,220
You think it would look okay value your opinion very much. So, all right, where's the bathroom gonna go after wait

04:54:26,029 --> 04:54:35,500
Why is that there? I don't have a garage. Where's the front of the house? I can't find the front of the house

1542
04:54:35,740 --> 04:54:48,680
Where am I? Okay. This is the garage. All right, so it's not enclosed

1543
04:54:48,799 --> 04:54:55,380
You pull the car up here and you can get out. This is the front door

1544
04:54:57,270 --> 04:55:13,229
Where you get out and here's where you go in through the garage, but I say okay, so this is the bathroom

1545
04:55:13,909 --> 04:55:21,479

1552
04:56:59,580 --> 04:57:27,610
Is it weird though? I gotta open this up and see what this looks like because this this has to be the bathroom

1553
04:57:27,610 --> 04:57:32,490
Well, this could be the kitchen and this could be the bathroom

1554
04:57:34,119 --> 04:57:58,509
You understand because the kitchen I feel like needs to be here because this will be the kitchen

1555

So you'll walk in and here's the little area. We put your keys whatever and then oh the kitchen

Yeah, you can put the groceries in the garage

1559
04:59:05,599 --> 04:59:13,619
Yeah, where's the load-bearing wall? There isn't one apparently

1560
04:59:19,459 --> 04:59:38,139

05:14:04,580 --> 05:14:08,020
I just have to get something in here to have enough be terrible

1602
05:14:08,020 --> 05:14:16,080
Well, this is gonna be the kitchen that means bathroom has to move. So let's get rid of all this crap

1603
05:14:16,080 --> 05:14:33,729
I can sell but wait, I thought the windows were permanent. Did they change that? That must have been an update. Oh

1604
05:14:33,930 --> 05:14:43,139
You could not touch the windows before I guess you can now

1605
05:14:46,659 --> 05:15:03,200
Interesting. Okay. Well that changes a lot then so I want this to be the kitchen. So you walk in

1606
05:15:03,880 --> 05:15:14,099
Bang kitchen bridge is gonna be get rid of these windows put them in later

1607
05:15:14,099 --> 05:15:28,759
I have to get my furniture in first before the windows gone. So

1608
05:15:29,400 --> 05:15:34,080
kitchen here that means I need what I need and you get the

1609
05:15:34,880 --> 05:15:39,779
Ground nice kitchen floor. I would say would be linoleum

05:15:41,340 --> 05:15:44,689
vinyl big into vinyl and kitchens

1611
05:15:45,330 --> 05:15:53,369
You could dump a whole glass of wine on the ground and vinyl and just get it up easily

1612
05:15:54,009 --> 05:15:58,459
All right

1613
05:15:58,459 --> 05:16:07,400
No, I get that's the reason. Oh furniture

05:16:08,080 --> 05:16:10,580
What is it? Oh, yeah

1615
05:16:10,900 --> 05:16:13,970
What do I want on the floor?

1616
05:16:14,659 --> 05:16:22,099
floor

1617
05:16:22,099 --> 05:16:24,580
Natural stone that sounds kind of cool. What does it look like?

1618
05:16:48,220 --> 05:17:17,569
Not very good. Okay. What about cream tiles? I don't hate cream tiles in a kitchen too bright. Mmm

1619
05:17:17,569 --> 05:17:25,380
I think it looks okay. Oh

1625
05:18:53,509 --> 05:19:06,849

1626
05:19:06,849 --> 05:19:08,130

1628
05:19:17,490 --> 05:19:55,880
Hmm. Yeah, I'm feeling it. Um

1629
05:19:56,840 --> 05:20:00,599

Okay, so I need

stainless

1640
05:22:28,330 --> 05:22:58,909
Stainless steel. I think stainless steel looks good put it down. What's going on? Put this shit down. No, that's in a bad spot

05:23:32,729 --> 05:23:50,709
Counters and then I'm thinking I like that. I like that, but I don't know what color I should do

1644
05:23:51,229 --> 05:24:00,799
It's green too powerful. Is that too much to go with like a

1645
05:24:01,500 --> 05:24:34,419
Whoo, what details I'll give that a look make it teal

1646
05:24:34,419 --> 05:25:02,319
Yeah, it's got to be darker either darker or just the old like just white goes white. That's good

1647
05:25:02,599 --> 05:25:25,639
There's no light in here now meltdown incoming. No, this house is too sterile and the fridge has to be white

1648
05:25:25,680 --> 05:25:35,419
It's like a cheap flipped Zillow house. I'm not a graphic designer. I don't know how to do this

1649
05:25:35,419 --> 05:25:48,209
We're hanging hanging cabinets

1650
05:26:14,080 --> 05:26:43,220
I don't that's not bad. We better. Okay. Now I need I got the oven. I've got the range

1654
05:27:54,169 --> 05:28:30,869
There's it in the right place. What the fuck is this thing? All right. All right, I think it's the oven

1655
05:28:31,029 --> 05:28:41,000
All these can open. This is a rest stop bathroom. I think it goes over in the over here though

1656
05:28:41,000 --> 05:29:05,209
It's a bar. That's how we what's wrong with that. It looks okay. I should get like a trash compactors functional cabinets

1657
05:29:05,209 --> 05:29:29,569
We go dishwasher dishwasher stove dishwasher

1658
05:29:30,490 --> 05:29:56,700
Little table. I'll come back to it. I don't know. I'll come back to it. I need some life in here crashing

1659
05:29:56,779 --> 05:30:31,580
I want those recessed cans. That doesn't look bad. Just get a huge piece of artwork right here and I'm done napkins

1660
05:30:31,979 --> 05:30:57,020
Knife forks. Yeah, put like little little gravy boats and shit everywhere. Look a bread box a bedpan

1661
05:30:57,180 --> 05:31:46,279
Okay, sure cutting board. This is cute. Look it's coming together. I like it about a big bowl of fruit

1662
05:31:46,279 --> 05:31:56,330
You guys

1663
05:31:56,849 --> 05:31:59,220
90% of house

1664
05:31:59,459 --> 05:32:07,349
Decorate like it's all just bullshit. That's all the counters who nobody cares about the cubes in the house

1665
05:32:07,349 --> 05:32:11,349
But the care about is what paintings on the wall and how many fruits you have in the fruit basket

1666
05:32:11,349 --> 05:32:17,270
I'm gonna give shit about anything else. It's all about detail work. Nothing else matters only detail work

1667
05:32:17,270 --> 05:32:39,729
You are the ultimate white guy. Why?

1668
05:32:40,330 --> 05:33:02,139
Why what he why what do you mean? What are you talking about? What what why?

1669
05:33:02,520 --> 05:33:07,819
Why is the corner empty because I'm gonna put something over there. I just haven't figured out what

1670
05:33:08,180 --> 05:33:12,540
Rome wasn't built in the day. It took them the whole of it long. The Bible took the right

1671
05:33:12,700 --> 05:33:44,220
All right. What am I getting right? Okay any table Rome wasn't written in the Bible

1672
05:33:44,220 --> 05:33:50,209
But what okay Rome wasn't built in the day

1673
05:33:50,369 --> 05:33:56,500
What did God do the Garden of Eden or something Garden of Eden wasn't built in the day?

1674
05:33:56,659 --> 05:34:02,580
There's another saying there's two of these the Garden of Eden was crafted after what is it?

1675
05:34:02,659 --> 05:34:11,340
God did a lot of things God made the world in seven days. All right. Yeah, that's what I mean

1676
05:34:11,340 --> 05:34:15,380
Rome wasn't built in the day. God took seven days to make the earth. So I've got some time

1677
05:34:15,380 --> 05:34:20,669
I can't it's not gonna say I've been here for an hour. God got seven days. Give me seven days

1678
05:34:20,790 --> 05:34:47,500
Rome one built in the day. I need a table even a little one. There'll be a dining room table

1679
05:34:47,500 --> 05:35:05,340
Oh, I like that. Is this weird to like open the door and this is the dining table

1680
05:35:05,340 --> 05:35:14,689
I don't think so. Where's it supposed to go?

1681
05:35:14,810 --> 05:35:33,470
Just wait till I finish this get all the detail work that all that that God has done, right?

1682
05:35:33,509 --> 05:35:36,729
Think about the detail work look at Mount Fiji, okay

1683
05:35:36,729 --> 05:35:42,720
I think God was really concerned that much about like the the pavement like the gravel on the ground

1684
05:35:42,720 --> 05:35:57,919
No, he's he was busy. He was busy crafting Mount Fiji in detail work. Here's your gravel on the ground

1685
05:35:58,040 --> 05:36:14,119
Just wait till I get to my Mount Fiji Mount Fuji. That's yes. That's the one I'm referring to

1686
05:36:20,430 --> 05:36:29,069
He's the water. Whatever. You know what I'm trying to say. I promise I like graduated college

1687
05:36:29,150 --> 05:36:34,180
Maybe just seeped out of me. Did it seep out?

1688
05:36:34,340 --> 05:36:40,330
Maybe there's like a hole in the back of my head and just like info is just slowly pissing out like a gas leak

1689
05:36:40,330 --> 05:36:51,889
I think I'm fine. I think I'm alright. Fiji is an island

1690
05:36:53,099 --> 05:36:57,180
Exactly what I'm talking about think about how much

1691
05:36:57,939 --> 05:37:07,290
Craftwork God had to go through to craft that island of Fiji all the all the foliage all the fawns and all that and all that

1692
05:37:07,290 --> 05:37:27,889
The all the stuff that's there somebody says lead exposure

1693
05:37:33,819 --> 05:37:40,200
Mount Fiji island. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right

1694
05:37:40,479 --> 05:37:55,659
Let's have a doorbell though. Nice apartment. No bread in there. All right. I need some paintings

1695
05:37:55,659 --> 05:38:13,779
I'm done like done streaming in like 10 minutes. Who cares? I mean I do I like I'm having fun this detail work out

1696
05:38:13,819 --> 05:39:25,799
Okay, put like flowers in nature shit and just colors all over the place. You're gonna be fine. It's too big

1697
05:39:25,799 --> 05:40:05,540
All right. Okay. Hold on. I'm gonna have some hanging on the wall. I've got a decoration. How would you have Medusa?

1698
05:40:05,540 --> 05:40:16,889
I'm gonna find an excuse to leave your house if you have this like I forgot to brush my teeth

1699
05:40:16,889 --> 05:40:45,900
I have to go home, you know, y'all are giving me shit for this

1700
05:40:45,900 --> 05:40:47,900
But I guarantee you you know

1701
05:40:48,220 --> 05:40:51,619
Somebody in your life that has this kind of shit everywhere

1702
05:40:51,619 --> 05:41:09,750
I bet you you've walked into somebody's kitchen and gone the hell is going on in here. It's like a weird bronze Greyhound

1703
05:41:10,349 --> 05:41:38,200
Statue in the corner in the kitchen. All right, let's put I'm done. See the bathroom table bothers me

1704
05:41:38,200 --> 05:41:51,909
It needs to be smaller. I agree with you. That's it floor. How about um stone white tiles? Let's see. How's this look?

1705
05:41:51,909 --> 05:42:18,299
Yeah, the tables not good. I know it needs to be in a smaller and different spot. Why is the bathroom so big?

1706
05:42:18,299 --> 05:42:26,080
I don't know ideas. I want room to shower and to bathe and go in the tub and stuff which reminds me

1707
05:42:26,080 --> 05:42:38,060
I think I'm doing a bath bomb tonight. I think so. All right ones in the chat if you want to do a bath bomb

1708
05:42:38,500 --> 05:42:58,810

Interesting in the bathroom here. Ooh, this is kind of cool. How does this look awful? Let's find out

1712
05:43:19,880 --> 05:43:55,110
It's not what I thought I picked up I'll buy surprise. Yep. What does this actually look like? Okay, pretty ocean

1713
05:43:55,509 --> 05:44:52,110
The ground could use a little bit of work get help. Why because you don't like my choices. This guy is on drugs

1714
05:44:52,110 --> 05:45:08,279
I am NOT on drugs. I'm on what God gave me oxygen life. Maybe pick up the Bible once in a while

1715
05:45:08,279 --> 05:45:39,139
Okay, why does it look this shitty? Is it the light? It's a light. Alright, so now I need a I want a tub

1716
05:45:39,299 --> 05:45:57,939
Whoa, are you shitting me? Yep. How do I put this in? I need a fixture. I need a tub fixture

1717
05:45:57,939 --> 05:46:28,330

1718
05:46:28,330 --> 05:46:37,069
But I would I want a urinal the amount of time and the I just want one so bad

1719
05:46:37,270 --> 05:47:18,369
Why does it it's just you know, it just have to piss into this thing. It's just so convenient shower. Okay, I need

1720
05:47:19,819 --> 05:48:00,939
Toilet washer bathtub plumbing system. Here we go. It counts as a bathtub, right? Oh, hell. Yeah way

1721
05:48:00,939 --> 05:48:01,779
I need a shower

1722
05:48:01,779 --> 05:48:21,569
Don't even tell me you wouldn't want one of these you had access to this just 24-7 just in your house in your bathroom

1723
05:48:21,569 --> 05:48:36,299
All right. Now I need a toilet. You wouldn't use it. Yeah, you would all the time

1724
05:48:53,330 --> 05:48:55,330
Was this a toilet? Is that a right toilet?

1725
05:48:57,139 --> 05:48:59,139
suspended toilet plumbing system

1726
05:49:03,020 --> 05:49:35,209
Suspended toilet. I mean that's kind of that's kind of swanky. Well, it kind of looks like a baby potty

1727
05:49:35,209 --> 05:50:03,459
But whatever I always see these in hotels and stuff and I always think they look cool. Yeah, I want one why it's so low

1728
05:50:18,869 --> 05:50:21,590
Like a lay down where you

1729
05:50:26,330 --> 05:50:35,939
It really is a potty how would you use this? Oh my god

1730
05:50:36,580 --> 05:50:40,869
And the urinals too high

1731
05:50:43,040 --> 05:50:53,970
I'm trying to see what with this would look like you'd have to be legs would have to be wide and

1732
05:50:54,930 --> 05:51:03,750
You'd have to just squat you don't have anything to hold on to it's not even a toilet seat

1733
05:51:04,310 --> 05:51:19,380
What is this thing? Why do they hit? What's this for sale for? I can't even move it. Whatever. I need a sink fixture

1734
05:51:34,409 --> 05:51:38,189
Even this sink what's happening?

1735
05:51:40,680 --> 05:51:42,759
I

1736
05:51:42,759 --> 05:51:46,860
Am I 30 feet tall? I'm so confused

1737
05:51:50,150 --> 05:52:14,479
Okay. No, do you see how low this was? Okay. I think it's fine. No, that's normal. That's normal

1738
05:52:14,479 --> 05:52:29,240
Oh my god, this is this is just where you just spit the mouthwash. That's that little thing

1739
05:52:29,240 --> 05:52:41,119
The dentist has next to the chair. I don't know. I didn't mean to put it

1740
05:52:41,119 --> 05:52:47,259
I didn't realize I'm gonna be this slab was gonna be so huge. I just need a mirror

1741
05:52:47,779 --> 05:52:51,930
That toilet is freaking me out. Why is it so low to the ground? Why?

1742
05:52:58,279 --> 05:53:24,799
Okay, I don't like the gold I think it's way too big. This is okay. This is all right. It's pretty modern

1743
05:53:24,799 --> 05:53:51,080
I don't get it. All right. All right. I don't care. Whatever. It's give me a door

1744
05:53:51,080 --> 05:54:00,810
And then I'm probably gonna call it another another twisted

1745
05:54:00,810 --> 05:54:15,759
Why doesn't say Hell's Kitchen stream another twisted? What is the name of the game house flipper? Not Hell's Kitchen?

1746
05:54:16,040 --> 05:54:18,040
What another twisted I

1747
05:54:18,040 --> 05:54:33,040
Why don't I want to say Hell's Kitchen another twisted house slipper stream? Okay. There you go. It's Christmas Eve

1748
05:54:33,040 --> 05:55:08,790
I can't even get in here. I don't think yeah, I can why is this so weird looking?

1749
05:55:08,790 --> 05:55:51,459
Why is it just barely too small? I love these colors though

1750
05:55:51,459 --> 05:56:47,900
I really do fucking happen in here the front door bro. This is the front door. No, oh you motherfucker. Just come here

1751
05:56:48,360 --> 05:57:04,779
Why can't I pick it up? I just I didn't mean to do that. No, I'm done. It's pretty good apartment

1752
05:57:04,860 --> 05:57:17,259
Okay, that's fun open bathroom no, I was gonna I'm trying to put a door there. All right

1753
05:57:17,259 --> 05:57:20,909
I will see you guys on Christmas Eve

1754
05:57:20,909 --> 05:57:28,770
We're gonna play some itch EO games if you have any games that you want me to play itch EO little horror ones

1755
05:57:29,169 --> 05:57:31,860
weird entertaining

1756
05:57:31,860 --> 05:57:33,139
quirky ones

1757
05:57:33,139 --> 05:57:36,509
I'm gonna play them then I

1758
05:57:38,470 --> 05:57:45,700
Should on Christmas Eve be able to give you guys a link to take the end of the New Year's Eve stream

1759
05:57:47,049 --> 05:57:49,770
The words so you should be the vote for what you want to vote for

1760
05:57:50,569 --> 05:57:54,169
Hopefully as of New Year's Eve if I can't get it ready by New Year's Eve

1761
05:57:54,169 --> 05:58:01,599
I can't get the poll ready and I'm probably gonna have to delay the New Year's Eve stream

1762
05:58:01,860 --> 05:58:07,849
Should be more like a New Year's first week of New Year's stream, but I

1763
05:58:08,409 --> 05:58:17,500
Very confident I can get it ready by 24th with that. We're gonna say goodbye. I think six hours is perfect here

1764
05:58:17,700 --> 05:58:25,569
Thanks for watching. It was fun house flipper is always an adventure

1765
05:58:26,009 --> 05:58:31,520
Didn't really get to build anything weird this time, but it's just fun to hang out and fuck around you guys

1766
05:58:31,520 --> 05:58:49,250
So as always yeah, the rumble would be on the same day. This was a crack stream

1767
05:58:49,250 --> 05:58:55,659
It was sometimes you have just sometimes you have one you just sober up

1768
05:58:56,400 --> 05:59:07,689
I've had a bag of peanuts a light breakfast and a coffee this game just does it to me. I don't know what it is

1769
05:59:12,799 --> 05:59:19,939
That was a nightmare. I think it was no I don't think it was a nightmare. I thought it was a

1770
05:59:20,580 --> 05:59:24,869
That was a daymare

1771
05:59:24,869 --> 05:59:39,950
