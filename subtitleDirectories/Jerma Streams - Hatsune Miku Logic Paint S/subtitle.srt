1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
It's not a funny Thanksgiving special. Miku Picross.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:11,029
It's not a funny Thanksgiving, it's just a Thanksgiving whine downstream.

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:14,779
I'm gonna talk very, very lightly, very slowly.

4
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:21,179
Write ones in chat, if you just kind of got the notification that I was live.

5
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,179
And you're on the couch.

6
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:27,859
And you got the phone in one hand and one of your eyes are open looking at it.

7
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:32,229
And you're just kind of on the couch, just, oh shit, he's live.

8
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,469
I'm just gonna chill today.

9
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,060
I'm not gonna talk loud. I'm gonna do some Miku Picross.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:48,490
What do you mean two? What do you mean two? Where are you?

11
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,750
ASMR Andy.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,270
We're gonna play, alright, so let's go over this.

13
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,579
I know a lot of people are like, what are you doing?

14
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,579
I saw that Miku Picross came out two days ago. Three days ago.

15
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:11,459
I was like, oh, I remember I played that Miku game and everyone was like, oh, everyone loved it.

16
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,900
I love Picross.

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,780
Of course, I'm gonna play the Miku Picross game that comes out.

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,780
And I don't want to hear it from people in chat that this game came out a year ago on the Switch.

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,730
I am a PC CD-ROM player.

20
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,099
But yeah, let's just chill.

21
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,780
We're gonna do a relaxing Thanksgiving whine down.

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,780
Maybe the stream will, I don't know, maybe a couple hours, two, three hours, just to relax.

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:50,150
I don't need to do anything crazy today, just to chill.

24
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,310
Hope you had a good Thanksgiving.

25
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,310
In offline chat, people were saying that I should do the Thanksgiving tier list.

26
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,310
I already did it.

27
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,900
But if you just need a quick refresh.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,900
Hold on, I don't want to like burp on you.

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:16,289
Okay, so Thanksgiving tier list, I believe.

30
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,289
Stuffing and mashed potatoes.

31
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:20,289
Stuffing is S tier. It's the highest thing.

32
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:27,460
Mashed potatoes are also somewhere around early S, maybe A.

33
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,460
Maybe mid A, mid S.

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,719
And there's a lot of new viewers, so let's go over this.

35
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,219
And I told you we were gonna relax today, but I'm gonna get a little angry right now.

36
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,219
Because people are gonna get mad at me and I'm gonna get angry back.

37
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:47,219
This is the only time we're gonna get an elevated vocal range here, okay?

38
00:02:47,219 --> 00:03:01,449
So I think that canned cranberry sauce is 100 times better than real cranberry sauce.

39
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:07,139
The stuff that's in the can, that comes out and it's shaped like a can when it comes out.

40
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,699
Like a cartoon.

41
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:18,009
And when that, listen, when you turn that sideways so it's the shape of the can cranberry sauce.

42
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:20,009
It's more like a cranberry jelly.

43
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,590
Exactly.

44
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,020
You turn it sideways and you slice hockey pucks.

45
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,020
A little bit thinner than a hockey puck.

46
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,020
But hockey puck, hockey puck, hockey puck, hockey puck.

47
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,520
Spatula that up, get it on your plate.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,759
You now have the opportunity to take cranberry jelly, cranberry sauce whenever you want.

49
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,759
It's not gonna get all over everything.

50
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:54,759
Sometimes you don't want cranberry sauce all over your mashed potatoes and the turkey and the potato, you know what I'm saying?

51
00:03:54,759 --> 00:04:05,750
It gives you the opportunity to take a sliver of that cranberry puck and put the cream cheese spread it onto the turkey.

52
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,990
It's, I'm telling you, that's S+.

53
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:19,480
Hockey, like hockey puck size, not hockey puck texture or flavor.

54
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:26,139
It had to be, okay.

55
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,139
It had to be hovered right over the end stream button and I pressed space accidentally.

56
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,449
Well, all right.

57
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,449
I'm live, I'm here.

58
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:46,829
What a bad stream.

59
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,829
Can you imagine?

60
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:55,519
I just go live for two minutes to talk about how much I like hockey puck cranberry sauce and leave.

61
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:03,660
That actually is kind of funny and I could have just stuck with that.

62
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,660
I apologize for those of you that, let's get, should I explain this again for everyone that just came back?

63
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,079
I need to explain this because people are gonna be like, what the fuck happened?

64
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:21,569
Wait for people to refresh.

65
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,769
You have 20 more seconds.

66
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:26,139
Okay.

67
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,139
All right.

68
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,139
So I'm imagining people have refreshed.

69
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,139
Let's just go over really quickly what just happened.

70
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,139
So I hit the, I hit the go live button on my OBS over here and didn't move the mouse.

71
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,139
I just press go live and now here I am.

72
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,139
And I'm talking to you, right?

73
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,139
Like after a minute or so, I didn't move the mouse.

74
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:49,139
So I accidentally in a rage talking about the cranberry sauce, hit space bar, which is confirm.

75
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,310
And it was hovering over the end stream button because I never moved the mouse.

76
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,310
There you go.

77
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,310
So now I don't, I don't have to explain it again.

78
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:03,110
I wish we should probably wait another few minutes and I'll explain it again for people to refresh another five minutes or so.

79
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,959
All right.

80
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,519
So today it's going to be a chill Miku Picross stream.

81
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,519
I don't have no idea what's in this game.

82
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,519
All I know is that I love Picross and I mean, I've played the Miku game.

83
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,519
Why not?

84
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,519
These are two things that are real.

85
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,519
I'm, I've played them.

86
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:31,300
Yeah.

87
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
We're only going to be live for maybe a couple of hours.

88
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
I just want, I don't know.

89
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
I want to do this thing.

90
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,480
I want to start doing more of this.

91
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,040
I kind of had this like epiphany and this is, I'm like not joking around.

92
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,040
I'm like, I mean this completely and fully.

93
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:53,709
I kind of like the idea of every so often just going live and it's, we just kind of chill and hang out maybe for a couple hours or something.

94
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:54,709
Just randomly.

95
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:57,709
I like that idea a lot.

96
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:02,379
A little bit more low energy stream sometimes because I feel like I'm so high energy all the time.

97
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,259
And that's like the only thing you ever see.

98
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,259
Right.

99
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:13,459
Like I'm always like so high energy, but like it's like, it's like five, six o'clock in the afternoon, evening.

100
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:18,459
I think we maybe I could maybe we get a couple of chill streams every now and again.

101
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:22,579
Right.

102
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:23,579
I know.

103
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:26,579
And look, you can have a chill stream and scream sometimes.

104
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,579
I know that sounds weird, but it happens.

105
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,959
But I know I'm going to just chill out.

106
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,959
I know that I'm going to get the question wrong and I'm going to scream, but it's all right.

107
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,959
We're still chilling out.

108
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,959
We're just hanging out.

109
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,959
Right.

110
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,519
You need to hit the bong.

111
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,019
No, no.

112
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:52,920
But I'll tell you, that's where opportunities like me strong playthrough.

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Right.

114
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,740
Bring back the comb streams.

115
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Yeah.

116
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,740
That's what I mean.

117
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,829
We could have, you know, this high energy streams and there's low energy streams.

118
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:04,829
I think it's a nice experiment to see how this works.

119
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,199
But I'm ready.

120
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,199
How do you have a low energy stream when like Miku is just banging like just blaring in the background?

121
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,949
Like when Miku is just like, what's the song?

122
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:31,240
No, that was wrong.

123
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
I did the wrong song.

124
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,120
That was Nyan Cat.

125
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Everybody chill out.

126
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
This is supposed to be a relaxing night.

127
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,809
This is supposed to be a relaxing night.

128
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:44,809
That was Nyan Cat.

129
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:45,809
All right.

130
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:46,809
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,179
I've got it wrong.

132
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,179
Isn't there?

133
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,179
No, no.

134
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,179
I had it right.

135
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,179
I did have it right.

136
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,179
That's a Miku song.

137
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:55,179
I'm telling everybody.

138
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:59,570
This is a real Thanksgiving relax stream.

139
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,570
True Miku fan.

140
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,570
That's right.

141
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,570
So when that's just blaring in the background, it's going to be hard to relax.

142
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,570
All right.

143
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,570
Everybody relax.

144
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,570
We need to collectively just hang out.

145
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,570
Okay.

146
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,570
All right.

147
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,730
I'm pressing the button.

148
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,889
You guys hear it?

149
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:18,889
I can't hear it.

150
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:20,639
When is the chill going to happen?

151
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,639
We're chilling as of exact.

152
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,139
Hey, look, I'm early too.

153
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,139
The stream hasn't even started yet.

154
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:29,779
You can play Fall Guys.

155
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,779
I'm not going to ever play Fall Guys ever again.

156
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,570
I'm just telling you, that's a fact.

157
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,570
I don't have anything against the game.

158
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,379
I'm just never playing that game ever, ever again.

159
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,379
It's a fun, cute game.

160
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:46,379
It's like a fun experience.

161
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,379
I'm just never going to play it ever again.

162
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,379
That's it.

163
00:09:50,379 --> 00:10:00,259
Face reveal.

164
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,700
All right.

165
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
So here we go.

166
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
Picross is fun.

167
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
If you've never played it before, you're about to see how it works.

168
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,700
I know I'm not going to.

169
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Okay.

170
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,059
Last time I played Picross, I explained how the Picross worked every 30 seconds.

171
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:17,429
So I'm not going to do that tonight.

172
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:19,429
We're just going to chill and play it.

173
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:21,179
What happened to your face?

174
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,179
I haven't shaved in like a week.

175
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,179
That's what happened.

176
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,240
So normal puzzles, special puzzles, music, gallery, settings.

178
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
I already did the settings a little bit.

179
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,990
Listen to music and unlock new songs.

180
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,990
How do I do that?

181
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,740
How do I do that?

182
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,100
I need money.

183
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,620
Well, you guys have to tell me which one you think is good.

184
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,059
Oh, we can unlock music.

185
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:02,120
Why does your chin have cell shading?

186
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,470
I don't know.

187
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,470
All right.

188
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,470
Let's play.

189
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,470
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

190
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,470
Hope you had a good one.

191
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,860
Hope you had a lot of turkey, a lot of and all that good stuff.

192
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,860
All right.

193
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,860
So here we go.

194
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,620
So these are going to be really easy.

195
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,620
It's going to be like, it's going to be impossible for me to lose these.

196
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,620
Let's go.

197
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Level one.

198
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
Here we go.

199
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,629
Wait, I can move the camera.

200
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,629
Actually, that's not a bad place for it.

201
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:30,629
This is fine over here.

202
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,450
Is there a timer?

203
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,450
There is.

204
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,450
All right.

205
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,450
So how Picross works?

206
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,450
I'm not doing that.

207
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,450
Stop.

208
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,970
OK, there's five.

209
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,590
I didn't mean to press that.

210
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,590
It just went over there.

211
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,590
I'm restarting.

212
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,559
OK.

213
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,360
That's that row of five.

214
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
All five.

215
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
There's five.

216
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,139
Do I have to explain this?

217
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,139
All right.

218
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:01,139
So hold on.

219
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,139
Paint.

220
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,139
What does check?

221
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,090
Because X is mark.

222
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,330
B is check.

223
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,330
Oh, OK.

224
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,330
I like doing it like that.

225
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,570
I'm not doing a hint.

226
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,570
So let's just go over this real quick.

227
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,570
Explain.

228
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,570
Explain.

229
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,000
All right.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,299
I'll explain.

231
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,299
OK.

232
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:18,299
Shit, I have to explain.

233
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,419
This is a relaxing stream.

234
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:23,419
OK.

235
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,419
So Picross is a video puzzle.

236
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,730
But you can do it on paper, too.

237
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:36,470
But so the first...

238
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,470
My chin is real, I swear.

239
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,470
OK.

240
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,029
So how you play Picross is...

241
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,029
You see the numbers on the...

242
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,029
I'm getting trolled.

243
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:52,259
OK.

244
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:53,259
So there's the two.

245
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:57,450
There it is.

246
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,450
So what do we make?

247
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,230
How does this game work?

248
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,230
Let's go type in, like, how does pic...

249
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,230
Oh, I unlocked some artwork.

250
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:23,220
Oh, my God.

251
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,220
There's a lot of stuff here.

252
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,250
Wait a minute.

253
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,250
Can't I already see it?

254
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,100
Cool.

255
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
There's a lot of levels.

256
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
All right.

257
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
I'm down.

258
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,980
OK.

259
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,980
I'm...

260
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,980
People are not going to stop saying it, so I'm going to explain it very quickly.

261
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
OK.

262
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,980
Let's do it very quickly.

263
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
In under 30 seconds.

264
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,820
If I go over 30 seconds, I'll turn the screen off.

265
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,419
The left and right are numbers, which indicate how many cubes need to be filled in in that

266
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:00,419
row or column.

267
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,659
For instance, there has to be five filled in long ways here because the five at the

268
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,340
top is how much needs to be there.

269
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,340
So we know it has to be all five because there's only five spaces.

270
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:16,820
By the way, if you see a space between the numbers, there has to be at least one cube

271
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,899
of free space between these two numbers.

272
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,700
So for instance, I'm not going to do it, but here and here, right?

273
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,860
There has to be at least one space between these two numbers going down.

274
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Here's your explanation.

275
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:40,100
If you don't understand it, read a fucking book.

276
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,500
It wasn't 35 seconds.

277
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,629
We're relaxing today.

278
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,610
Was it 30 seconds?

279
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,529
Which book?

280
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,759
I don't know.

281
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:07,980
What was the last book you guys read?

282
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,179
Well, we know it can't be...

283
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:12,379
And by the way, this is very important.

284
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:13,379
Two can't be over here.

285
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,179
It has to be sequential.

286
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,179
So this is the one.

287
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,580
There has to be a space, which is here.

288
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,179
So therefore, there needs to...

289
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:21,379
The two is here.

290
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,940
That's how it works.

291
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,740
You read the Bible the last book is you read.

292
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,379
Okay.

293
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:36,600
All right.

294
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:36,799
All right.

295
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,200
New artwork.

296
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,759
What is it?

297
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:38,960
I don't know.

298
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,759
What are these pictures?

299
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,129
I'm not even looking at the pictures.

300
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:48,879
Okay.

301
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,639
What's your favorite book?

302
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,639
I actually haven't read a book in a long time.

303
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,690
Bad.

304
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,289
Although I don't know.

305
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,129
I've...

306
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:00,559
I have read...

307
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,559
I think the world has completely changed in a way.

308
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,330
What I mean by that is...

309
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:12,179
So there's a lot of information you can read online.

310
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,779
There's a ton of articles and news programs.

311
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:20,580
And there's a lot of reading that you do on a regular basis.

312
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,419
That's not out of a book.

313
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:26,360
So you are still reading.

314
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,559
You're not necessarily...

315
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:31,620
I mean, I don't necessarily read novels anymore, right?

316
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,220
I don't really...

317
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,820
Not that I can remember.

318
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:42,440
But I do a lot of reading.

319
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,710
Yeah, the five by fives are always very easy.

320
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:52,580
When can I unlock new songs?

321
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,679
Reddit doesn't count.

322
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,480
No, I'm not...

323
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Look.

324
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,279
I'm just saying that you do read a lot on a daily basis.

325
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:09,150
It's not necessarily a novel, but you are reading a lot.

326
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:09,750
Okay.

327
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,549
How many...

328
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:11,349
Oh, there's a whole...

329
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:11,950
Oh, level one.

330
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,549
Level two.

331
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:14,349
What else is here in level...

332
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:14,750
All right.

333
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,349
So we're going to...

334
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:22,329
I'll get through these quick.

335
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,329
Can you lower the sound effects?

336
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:29,180
Are they loud?

337
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,380
Sounds too loud?

338
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,579
Turn the music up and the sound down?

339
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,740
Is that what you want?

340
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:42,549
Because I can do that.

341
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:44,900
Music's a little loud.

342
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,740
Is that a little better?

343
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,539
Music's too loud?

344
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,309
Is that better?

345
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:56,579
I think we're in a good spot, right?

346
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:57,779
There's special puzzles, too.

347
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:58,180
All right.

348
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Let me get some money so we can make some...

349
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,140
Unlock some stuff.

350
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,339
All right.

351
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:05,740
Let's see.

352
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,539
So remember, this is where it gets interesting because obviously one, two, three, it could be there.

353
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,940
It could also be one, two, three.

354
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,960
Therefore, what have we deduced, everybody?

355
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,950
If it has to be three going this way and there's only five spaces, what have we deduced?

356
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,900
Exactly.

357
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,099
Nice work.

358
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,900
And again, what...

359
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,140
Guys, what can we deduce from this row?

360
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,339
It has to be a space in the middle.

361
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,079
How can we deduce it?

362
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,880
What do you think?

363
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,130
I mean, what do I have to deduce this from?

364
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,930
One, space, then three.

365
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,730
You get it now.

366
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,579
You guys get it.

367
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:50,380
By the way, Picross is probably one of the most relaxing fun games I've ever played.

368
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,380
There are a hundred million versions of what you are seeing on the screen.

369
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,980
It's on every app store.

370
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,779
It's on every single device.

371
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,180
You can find it.

372
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
It's a lot.

373
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,980
So if you like this, you go, oh, well, this is cool.

374
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
I wish I had like a hundred billion puzzles to do.

375
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,579
They exist.

376
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:07,779
All right.

377
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,779
So what have we deduced here?

378
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,579
Here's what we've deduced here.

379
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:15,619
I actually want to do that because this is physically not possible.

380
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:22,019
If we know these two are here and this is a three in this in this down and up and down.

381
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,220
It cannot possibly be here.

382
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,619
You guys get it.

383
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,500
You understand?

384
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,299
No one's too dumb.

385
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:39,460
No one's dumb enough to not know this.

386
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,700
Okay.

387
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,420
Okay.

388
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,660
That was pretty good deduction right there.

389
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,259
All right. So this is three.

390
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:54,700
And there it is.

391
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
What the deuce?

392
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,190
Why did you just say that?

393
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,779
You guys want me to look at every picture that comes up?

394
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:12,539
Or should we just wait and just go through the gallery later?

395
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:12,940
Please.

396
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,339
God.

397
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:17,009
No.

398
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:23,279
I think you're the only person that said that.

399
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,059
There were.

400
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:25,660
It's okay.

401
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,460
This chat moves pretty fast, right?

402
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,059
It's hard sometimes to pick up what everybody's saying.

403
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:36,259
But that was I think three nos and every single other person said yes.

404
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:38,660
I kind of feel bad for the people that said no.

405
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,059
It's like shit.

406
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:44,660
There's like 96 percent majority that said they want to see this.

407
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:54,829
Okay, cool.

408
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:57,990
I feel bad for them having no taste.

409
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,559
Well, I mean, come on.

410
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,099
This is going to be a quick one.

411
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:06,700
That's a world record.

412
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,539
I think that puzzle that might be the world record because I might be one of them.

413
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:14,339
I don't know how many people played that level and went that fast.

414
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:23,220
I probably in the top 20.

415
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:33,259
I love these mini cans.

416
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:37,369
What is it?

417
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:42,410
Pog Pog Pog.

418
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:48,049
You guys like this character?

419
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:54,910
The little cans are great because so the bit I don't like drinking an entire huge soda

420
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,109
unless I don't know why this is the way this is.

421
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,710
But let's go over this.

422
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,910
Oh, it just got absolutely real.

423
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,109
By the way, this is now real.

424
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:05,309
Those were little warm up rounds.

425
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,309
But now is where you have to really start to pay attention.

426
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:15,309
Some of these hit cross games can get to be 25 20 by 20 50 by 50 sometimes.

427
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,099
They get they get kind of crazy.

428
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:20,599
But anyway, so look at this.

429
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,500
Look at how difficult this is.

430
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,500
So there's a two down here.

431
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,099
But where where the heck would that be?

432
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:28,849
A little bit of deduction.

433
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,250
How many was it?

434
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:29,650
What is it?

435
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,849
10 by 10.

436
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,450
So this is 10 by 10.

437
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,650
So take a look at this.

438
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,650
This is very interesting.

439
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,650
This dream is so funny.

440
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,650
It's like you're showing your grant.

441
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,890
What are you saying?

442
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:43,380
Like you're showing your grandkids anime that you don't understand.

443
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,579
Reduce this.

444
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:49,559
Wait, I'm showing my grandkids anime that I don't understand.

445
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,460
What does that mean?

446
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,660
I understand half of this because it's Picross.

447
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,259
So I can tell you about the Picross part.

448
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:04,930
I can't tell you about all the Miku characters, dude.

449
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,059
Okay, my grandmother one time.

450
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,259
My grandmother.

451
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:19,420
She she bought a hat one time and she bought this hat and she wore this hat all the time.

452
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,710
It was kind of one of those hats as a flip hat where it's got all the way around.

453
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,289
It was like not a beanie, but has like a brim on it.

454
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:33,099
So she wore this hat all the time and she didn't know what was on it.

455
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:39,700
She didn't know what was on the hat and what was on the front as a graphic.

456
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,099
A bucket hat, yeah.

457
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:46,519
So on the front of this hat was a graphic of the four South Park kids.

458
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,519
She had no idea what they were.

459
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:52,319
She thought they were just four cute young cute boys.

460
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,519
Like she just thought it was like kids.

461
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:57,339
She did not know that they were the South Park kids.

462
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:02,470
So that was kind of endearing.

463
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:10,529
And I feel like I'm am I doing that right now?

464
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:13,730
And it'd be like, oh grandma, you know, that's from a TV show.

465
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,130
Oh, the TV show with the four young cute young boys.

466
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,730
Yes, of course. I know that one.

467
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,799
Yeah, it was and she wore it all the time.

468
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:30,160
Did you deduce that? You should have.

469
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,359
Like she saw them as like little grandkids, not as kind of crass television.

470
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,500
OK, so here's what happened. Let's deduce it.

471
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,700
So what we've done here, you're probably wondering.

472
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,099
Jerma, I mean, you're so smart and everything you say so intelligent.

473
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:48,009
Help me. I'm having trouble.

474
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:50,670
So we filled in almost the whole bottom row.

475
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,569
What can we do now?

476
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:55,230
We now that this see the two and the seven at the top.

477
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,130
This is guaranteed to be these seven.

478
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,230
So all we have to do this. I love when this happens.

479
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,230
It's so much fun. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

480
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,319
And look what we've done over here.

481
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,789
We have deduced so much. Stop explaining.

482
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:17,190
I beg you. Your brain, your monkey brain takes too long.

483
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,769
That's not you're not chilling out, man.

484
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,869
Shut up. Shut up. You're an idiot.

485
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:23,470
This is not I don't see anybody chilling here.

486
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,569
I see people being rude.

487
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:28,700
It's supposed to be a chilling out time.

488
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:35,460
All right, so let's go.

489
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:43,269
Remember that? OK, no more explaining.

490
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:46,990
Actually, that sound kind of is annoying, isn't it?

491
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,190
Yes, that's the hat.

492
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,690
Somebody in sub streams put it up.

493
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,400
That's the hat. It's in sub stream right now.

494
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:00,140
That is the exact hat that my grandmother wore for years.

495
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,339
Yeah. OK, I'm going to turn this sound.

496
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:05,759
I'm going to turn the sound off. I don't like it after this one.

497
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,299
All right. So let's get going.

498
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:15,250
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Two.

499
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,549
Cool that it fills that in automatically.

500
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:22,059
A lot of these games don't do that.

501
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:24,549
Perfect chill time. I actually don't.

502
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:30,740
Please explain to us.

503
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,839
Why are you treating why are you treating this like Citizen Kane?

504
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:42,140
I'm trying to figure out what that what that person means.

505
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,440
I'm treating this.

506
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,630
Somebody said I'm treating this little Sudoku puzzle like Citizen Kane.

507
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,029
What does that mean?

508
00:26:52,029 --> 00:27:19,490
I just don't I just don't understand.

509
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,289
Here's the tricky part.

510
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:22,890
So this is going to go this way that way.

511
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:28,740
Oh, that goes to part of the five.

512
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:34,700
That's the one playing pick across alongside you.

513
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,900
Oh, let's see.

514
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:46,700
One, two, face one, two, three, four, five.

515
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,519
So what is this picture?

516
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,490
A dove. Oh, we got some artwork.

517
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,789
I didn't even talk about the little cans.

518
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:07,950
OK, so the little cans are the perfect size because how many ounces is it?

519
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,599
Let's see. Seven and a half ounces.

520
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:13,519
So it's almost eight ounces.

521
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,750
You get a big thing ice and you can just keep pouring this

522
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,150
in and pretend like you're drinking a full can.

523
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:26,460
So it's easy to hold.

524
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,960
I like it small.

525
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:40,329
I think I'll be able to clear this whole first and second page in the next like 20 minutes.

526
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:41,630
All right. This time, I'm not going to say anything.

527
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,430
It's up to you to deduce this because I'm just going to do it without your help.

528
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,230
I might need it eventually, but whatever.

529
00:28:48,230 --> 00:29:57,819
I think I can get this. I think I can get it.

530
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:00,819
OK, let's just assume this is the first one, which it is because it's telling me.

531
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:01,920
So that's one.

532
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,519
Let's say it's the other one is right here next to it.

533
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:08,289
That means I think this is what that means.

534
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:11,039
And that is exactly what it means.

535
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:18,690
OK, that's the is this the second?

536
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,089
So this is the second one.

537
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:23,690
That means this has to be here.

538
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,819
The other one is right here.

539
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:41,430
Take what else is that helping with one or one?

540
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,359
That's one.

541
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,019
And then it's three.

542
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:51,059
So this game actually helps a lot because what's you know, it's what's happening.

543
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:55,160
A lot of the a lot of pick cross games don't do this.

544
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,960
It won't see on the left here next down here.

545
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,359
See down here.

546
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,859
That one being grayed out is telling me this is that one.

547
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,160
A lot of them don't do that.

548
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,039
So this actually is a lot easier than a lot of typical pick cross games.

549
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,839
So that's it's cool.

550
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,839
So I know that this is the first one.

551
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,539
That means that these nothing else can be over here.

552
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:32,660
So now I want to know.

553
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,859
I don't know if this is part of the two part of the four.

554
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,230
I don't know that yet.

555
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,529
My cousin could beat your ass.

556
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:38,829
All right.

557
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:48,990
Well, that's that's fine.

558
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:56,119
Don't be true.

559
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,019
So this is the one.

560
00:31:57,019 --> 00:32:15,519
So that's really that's really good to know comfy.

561
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,579
Yeah, good guys.

562
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:28,789
Wicked handsome.

563
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:31,490
Okay, I'm being distracted.

564
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,529
So this is three.

565
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:47,500
This is the one and there's two three, four, five, six.

566
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,799
That's two.

567
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:55,400
Very nice.

568
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:06,119
Almost there.

569
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,099
Nice.

570
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:12,700
Wait, what'd you say?

571
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,369
Somebody said something here.

572
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,599
This is important.

573
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,099
Would you say something you asked?

574
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:22,690
We talked about this.

575
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,789
What the hell is you just right?

576
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:29,089
It was about how you okay, I asked an NPC in a dream for an invention idea

577
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:33,109
and she said something to me, but I forgot telling you.

578
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:37,089
You have to be make sure you get up and write it down.

579
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:37,990
Something about your dream.

580
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,690
We let's go over it one more time very briefly.

581
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,789
If you are in a dream.

582
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:44,980
Have you ever noticed that when you're in a dream?

583
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:51,250
Oh Christmas tree when you're in a dream people if you if you ask certain people

584
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,950
in your dreams about stuff, it will give you such unbelievable.

585
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,549
Oh my God.

586
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:55,450
I completely forgot about this.

587
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,299
Let me read this.

588
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:01,599
Okay, so I was a little high.

589
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,740
This is that this is out of absolutely nowhere, but I'm going to read this.

590
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:13,400
So I was kind of high and I wrote something that I think is unbelievably profound.

591
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:20,480
I remember just being like high sitting on the couch and going I have to write this now.

592
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,980
So I wrote this down.

593
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:27,079
This is I was a little bit high and I wrote this and I think it's incredibly profound.

594
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:30,340
So let me read it to you.

595
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,539
And this you might think this is coming out of nowhere, but it's it just kind of popped

596
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:37,639
in my head like oh like when you don't ever watch like for instance,

597
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,940
like some of the old videos that I have, you know back in like the TF2 era or back in whatever era,

598
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,739
you know, if you see like an old picture of you or something you like wow, look at that person.

599
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,440
Here it is.

600
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,400
This is about the preservation of audio and video preservation of audio and video.

601
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,309
Okay, and photos.

602
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:00,809
I haven't read this in a while.

603
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:04,210
So it's been like it's been like a week or so.

604
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:11,590
So I don't know how fucking stupid this might be, but I'm just going to go for it.

605
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:17,289
I feel like I'm going to give like a class presentation.

606
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:20,500
I think the Miku sound out of my ear.

607
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,389
Okay, preserving video and audio is slightly uncomfortable

608
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:31,190
because it's like time traveling to confront or combat your past self.

609
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,489
Needing to revisit almost a different person who no longer exists.

610
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:39,389
You aren't the you from before and you can feel it.

611
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:43,289
Your memories almost clash into each other when you think or see back,

612
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:48,190
almost like two different people's feelings agreeing and disagreeing at the same time.

613
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,489
You are the same, but that person doesn't exist.

614
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:54,489
It only exists because it lives in your brain.

615
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:56,389
That person will never exist again.

616
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:59,389
It's only a fleeting part of your mind.

617
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:02,690
And your accounts are all you have.

618
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:16,019
Memories turn into well-acted plays that you yourself start becoming the audience for.

619
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:23,679
What about that?

620
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:30,639
Did I read all the live tweeting of Poopy Halloween I did?

621
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,400
Vsauce made that video already?

622
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,800
Oh, whatever.

623
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,099
All right.

624
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,739
Let me see.

625
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:46,440
Oh, this, I also wrote this really high and this is wicked funny.

626
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,940
All right, ready?

627
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,440
I wrote this high.

628
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,139
I always try to keep track of things I'm saying.

629
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:51,739
So when I was high, this is like a few weeks ago.

630
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:54,440
I had another, I had a million-dollar idea and you guys are going to laugh,

631
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,940
but I don't, maybe you don't.

632
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,429
Million-dollar idea.

633
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:05,530
Fruit sweatshirts slash hoodies slash merch line with solid colors

634
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,329
and matching fruit patch of same color.

635
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:19,300
Banana slash bright yellow, strawberry slash bright red.

636
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:27,559
Like, wow, that sounds fucking actually pretty sick.

637
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:30,800
Okay, what else we got?

638
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,000
There's all the Hubby Halloween stuff.

639
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,469
Okay, so yeah, let me go over this.

640
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:42,079
I watched Hubby Halloween, the Adam Sandler movie.

641
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,280
And let me go over it.

642
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,110
I live tweeted the whole thing, but I never, I never tweeted it.

643
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,030
Do you want me to do the whole thing?

644
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,780
You want me to do the whole thing?

645
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,480
It's like, it's like two pages.

646
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,739
Okay, let's start.

647
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:13,949
So, let's start.

648
00:38:13,949 --> 00:38:18,929
So this is the entire Hubby Halloween movie from start to finish.

649
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:24,130
I wrote just my thoughts on it as the movie went on.

650
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,679
Mute the music.

651
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:31,380
I'm watching Hubby Halloween.

652
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,280
I don't know what this movie is about or who the fuck this guy is.

653
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,860
It's been 40 minutes.

654
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,960
Why is he walking around a high school dance?

655
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,449
Why is this guy in the movie?

656
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:46,150
Why are they all so fucking mean to this guy?

657
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,630
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

658
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,530
He has a magic superhero thermos.

659
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,230
He can throw it like Captain America's shield.

660
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,130
It can turn into anything.

661
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,329
Literally any object he needs in that current scene.

662
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:02,420
Is he a superhero?

663
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,360
It just made him food.

664
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,659
I think that's what was implied.

665
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:11,920
He poured a bunch of food into it and it made a smoothie.

666
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,690
Okay.

667
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,789
And then that's when I stopped doing draft tweets and I went to my notes.

668
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:27,280
Okay, and then it goes here.

669
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,099
Okay, here we go.

670
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:32,179
Wait, why are they on a scary road now?

671
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,880
Someone just threw a trash can at him while he was on his bike.

672
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,579
They are trying to kill him.

673
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:41,989
People are trying to fucking kill this guy.

674
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:44,489
This is major spoilers, by the way.

675
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:47,690
Why do we care that Walter is a werewolf?

676
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,190
Who is Walter?

677
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,860
Who is this other guy?

678
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,260
There are missing kids?

679
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,760
Wait, where was Hubby last seen?

680
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,460
I don't remember.

681
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,530
Were these kids with him?

682
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:05,230
He's not related to these people and he's shitting in their house.

683
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,239
He didn't wipe his ass and he waddled off the toilet.

684
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,539
A dog just ate his own shit on camera.

685
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:14,340
I'm serious.

686
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,309
That's what I just watched.

687
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:23,139
The dog is evil or was that the Walter guy?

688
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:25,239
What was the grenade?

689
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:34,090
He doesn't know he's in a haunted house and macing people.

690
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,889
Who is Paul Blart's character a parody of?

691
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:39,389
It seems like they want to tell you so bad.

692
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:44,780
It's really heavy-handed and I don't know.

693
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,480
They are pissing their clothes and they got caught.

694
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,780
The werewolf?

695
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,079
And the other guy, they're peeing their pants on a bench.

696
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,760
The world's going crazy now.

697
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,920
People are throwing rocks at him.

698
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,260
Shaq is now the narrator of the movie, but it's someone dubbing Shaq's voice.

699
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,159
Shaq is now a major character in the movie.

700
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:14,380
His wife's voice is dubbed too.

701
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,980
The police are doing a sting operation with Hubby.

702
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,550
They're trying to catch his high school crush?

703
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,969
The school crush is a demon?

704
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:25,570
They loved each other all along?

705
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:32,760
The killer is in the house.

706
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,239
Spoilers by the way, I'm serious.

707
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,500
Mom is the killer?

708
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,800
Are they all outside?

709
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,840
They're all, no one is dead.

710
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,340
She's pouring gasoline on them.

711
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,739
Just take the gas can away.

712
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:45,139
What the fuck, she's like 90.

713
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:47,039
It's, just get it.

714
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,699
He's contemplating letting them burn.

715
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:50,900
They were apparently bullies?

716
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,590
This whole scene was on TV?

717
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,989
Everyone just laughed and said there is no reason at all to dislike him.

718
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:01,019
They're laughing about it.

719
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,119
The whole cast is saying sorry.

720
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:07,400
And what about the werewolf?

721
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,559
Why were they trying to hurt him?

722
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,409
Like trying to hurt him, it was just no reason.

723
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:20,119
Mom is explaining how to be nicer to people and disappeared into the woods?

724
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,519
All these guys watch is Hubby.

725
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:23,219
Is this a joke?

726
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:25,619
She's acting like it's a prank.

727
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,119
He makes gadgets, like I don't get it.

728
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:33,539
He had super powers from Salem?

729
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:36,639
It is now a screaming compilation at the end.

730
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,739
Ha ha ha ha dude, I'm dying.

731
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:46,940
It's like I'm watching a YouTube compilation of Sandler screaming.

732
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,570
That's all I wrote.

733
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:59,690
The movie was crazy.

734
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,190
That movie was out of control.

735
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:06,389
I remember as I was watching it, I was like, I don't, I was also a little high.

736
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:13,739
I think you're noticing a theme here.

737
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:18,170
Honestly, if you watch Hubby Halloween, you're going to sit there and be like,

738
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,719
what is going on here?

739
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,900
What is happening right now?

740
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,159
You were not a little high.

741
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:32,059
The movie is just, it's just crazy.

742
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:45,599
It's just crazy stuff happening.

743
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:54,070
The sound effects volume, I'm sorry.

744
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,670
Imagine if the TV was turned off.

745
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,269
No, no, I'm telling you, if you go back and watch Hubby Halloween,

746
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:06,650
you're just simply going to go, wait, all the stuff he said like happens in this movie.

747
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:10,349
There's a part, I'm not kidding, there's a part where a dog is just eating his own shit.

748
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:13,059
And it's like, what's going on?

749
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:14,760
Why is this dog doing this?

750
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:23,260
It was just like, what's happening?

751
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,840
It was all right.

752
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,539
I did watch it.

753
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:38,559
I wasn't high.

754
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:39,860
Everybody relax.

755
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:49,699
Turn the sound effects down.

756
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:50,699
Was it a dream journal?

757
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:53,820
No, I just, I was kind of high and I was,

758
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,219
like it was like Halloween time.

759
00:44:55,219 --> 00:45:00,880
I'm like, I'll only put it on.

760
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,980
Is that better?

761
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,380
Just having no sound?

762
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:08,519
Let's see.

763
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:11,880
It might be better.

764
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,079
Is that your zonked journal?

765
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,949
Yeah, it kind of is.

766
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:17,650
There you go.

767
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,980
There's like the last few times I've been a little high

768
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,480
and I just write stuff down and I just wrote down like a whole Vsauce video.

769
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,380
Well, I thought I was being so profound.

770
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,389
I remember sitting there looking at that and just being like,

771
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:37,320
this is like potentially like Nobel Prize winning shit.

772
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:44,969
Turned out it was just a Vsauce video.

773
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:53,329
Okay, this one's going to be hard.

774
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:54,230
What should I do first here?

775
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:59,599
3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

776
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,190
I don't know.

777
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,090
5, 6, 7, 8.

778
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:08,849
What can I start with?

779
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:09,650
Maybe the 5.

780
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,150
Let's see.

781
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:15,579
3, 4, 5, space, 1, 2.

782
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:17,780
Really, what can I deduce here?

783
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,179
4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

784
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:28,579
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

785
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:32,539
Because if, let's see, if it was like this,

786
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,239
it was like boom, boom.

787
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,340
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

788
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:40,639
That would mean that this would have to be 1, 2, 3, 4.

789
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,539
1, 2, 3, 4.

790
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:43,739
1, 2, 3, 4.

791
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,039
So it has to be here, one of these.

792
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:51,019
1, 2, 3, 4.

793
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:51,719
3, 4.

794
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:57,510
So by deduction, it has to be these two and it is.

795
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:04,309
That doesn't help though.

796
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:05,710
Chest level gameplay.

797
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,949
We're just chilling out today.

798
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:09,250
I read you some more drafts.

799
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:20,219
There, aren't you happy?

800
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:21,019
Let me see.

801
00:47:21,019 --> 00:47:22,920
I'm going to, I'm going to go for it.

802
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,119
It was wrong.

803
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:24,619
It was wrong.

804
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:28,010
Reset it.

805
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,699
Okay.

806
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:30,099
It's okay.

807
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:33,969
I got it now.

808
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:39,679
This does help a lot because now this is the 1.

809
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:40,579
This is 5.

810
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:43,480
So right, if we give a count of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

811
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,280
Boink.

812
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,619
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

813
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:50,070
Cheated.

814
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:50,670
That's not cheating.

815
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,769
That's just deducing by failure.

816
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:58,699
I learned from my failure.

817
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:01,000
Can't hide the fact that you tore your pants like a barbarian

818
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,300
because you were too lazy to stand up.

819
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,900
No, I didn't want to stand up because I, I know.

820
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,800
There's no reason for me to tell you why.

821
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,300
I just didn't stand up because I felt like it.

822
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:18,260
That's it.

823
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:22,619
Okay, 3.

824
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:23,719
Well, it can't be here.

825
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:27,699
Oh, look what I just did.

826
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:32,320
Now it opens up.

827
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,579
It's that.

828
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:35,880
All right.

829
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,050
This is probably, I think this is all ones though.

830
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:44,650
It's annoying.

831
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,449
1, 2, 3, 4, space 1.

832
00:48:47,449 --> 00:48:49,250
Let's just assume.

833
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:54,050
We can't assume.

834
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:54,750
Maybe we can.

835
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,449
1, 2, 3, 4.

836
00:48:56,449 --> 00:48:57,349
1, 2, 3.

837
00:48:57,349 --> 00:48:58,650
No, we can.

838
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,550
So that means that it has to be 1, 2.

839
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:04,480
It has to be here and here.

840
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,380
So we can do that.

841
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,480
That's correct.

842
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,079
This is also a 1.

843
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:08,980
That's the first one.

844
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,739
So there you go.

845
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:12,940
And there's another one here.

846
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,139
Okay, so that's 4.

847
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:16,179
That's 1, 2, 3, 4.

848
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:16,980
1, 2, 3, 4.

849
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,679
We don't know.

850
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:20,090
We can't decide that.

851
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,489
Is everyone relaxing?

852
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:22,389
Somebody said this game sucks.

853
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:29,519
I want them banned for at least one full minute.

854
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:31,619
It's always hard when you have very small numbers

855
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,320
with large gaps.

856
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,920
Because this is the 1.

857
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,519
At some point from here to here is another 1.

858
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:40,920
And it's just hard to know where it is.

859
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,030
I'll get it though.

860
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,030
All right, so I think I can do this though now.

861
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,530
So this is 2.

862
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,130
1, 2, 3, space 1.

863
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,409
Got it.

864
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:50,510
Very cool.

865
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,809
This is the part of the 3.

866
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:53,610
1, 2, 3.

867
00:49:53,610 --> 00:50:00,219
Can't be here.

868
00:50:00,219 --> 00:50:03,409
This is 1.

869
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:09,469
That's very helpful.

870
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:10,469
This is part of the 4.

871
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:13,300
1, 2, 3, 4.

872
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,840
Very nice.

873
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,940
You're never going to win this game.

874
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,389
I guarantee you I do.

875
00:50:18,389 --> 00:50:20,360
I would bet.

876
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,659
I bet you I complete this level.

877
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:26,099
I bet you $100 trillion that I will compete.

878
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:27,800
I will beat this level.

879
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,599
There's no time limit.

880
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:30,500
I will just this level will this level right here

881
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,800
that you're seeing on the screen right now.

882
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,099
I will finish it.

883
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:37,300
It'll do the thing and it'll give us whatever the thing that

884
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,099
I'm going to finish it.

885
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:38,900
But don't worry.

886
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,300
It's literally impossible for me to not finish this exact

887
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,500
level right here.

888
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,599
Nobody's going to nobody's going to like, you know,

889
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:45,800
monkey paw me, right?

890
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
It's like this is what I'm telling you.

891
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,900
I'm telling it's a hundred trillion dollars that I will

892
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,099
beat this exact screen right here.

893
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:56,800
I will beat this this level right now level 1-008 and

894
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,500
there's no time limit.

895
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:26,219
This is part of the 3.

896
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,000
This is also might be the 3.

897
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:29,099
I think that's the 4 right here.

898
00:51:39,309 --> 00:51:40,510
It's not over.

899
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:41,610
No, it's not.

900
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:41,909
What do you mean?

901
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:43,010
It's not no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

902
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,940
Stop that.

903
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,539
No, you didn't.

904
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,340
I didn't say I couldn't make any mistakes.

905
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,440
I just said I was going to complete this level.

906
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:50,239
I didn't say it.

907
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:52,239
And by the way, there were no mistakes allowed.

908
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,039
When did I say that?

909
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:54,739
That was not but don't curl that monkey paw.

910
00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:56,679
It's not happening ever.

911
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:57,480
This is chill stream.

912
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,280
I never said it by the way.

913
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,679
I'm not allowed to make a single purple X.

914
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:06,539
No, I just said I'm going to complete the level you get.

915
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:07,639
You can talk all the shit you want.

916
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:08,440
That's not the case.

917
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,230
I like the music chill.

918
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:51,239
I don't have anything in this role, but it can't be here.

919
00:52:51,539 --> 00:53:01,690
That's beer all starts coming together now.

920
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:42,630
What are you smoking?

921
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:43,530
I'm not smoking anything.

922
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,829
I'm drinking a can of Sprite.

923
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:51,789
Big hand.

924
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,280
Why can't I just drink like a normal person?

925
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,199
Sprite.

926
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:03,900
I like Sprite.

927
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:08,190
Sprite's very simple.

928
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:10,789
It's very just it's just like a sweet bubbly drink.

929
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:19,139
This whole stream is going to be claimed.

930
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:20,840
I think like this whole stream is going to be muted.

931
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:24,039
So I'm glad you're here chilling out on Thanksgiving Day

932
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:24,539
wind down.

933
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,179
This entire stream is going to get muted.

934
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,099
Just to let you know.

935
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,179
Hey, but the thing is though you might not even need sound

936
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,280
because if you just watch me play the game you see kind of

937
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,780
my what my deductions and stuff.

938
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,099
You can still enjoy it.

939
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:42,000
Just put on your own soundtrack.

940
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:48,820
I do like 7up.

941
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:52,619
I like 7up more than Sprite in the flavor department,

942
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:58,659
but Sprite is a little lighter, right?

943
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,260
7up I think is better tasting than Sprite,

944
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:03,260
but Sprite is lighter.

945
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:07,269
So if you want a lighter drink, you know, that's what I choose.

946
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,539
That one was simple.

947
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,539
Now this is going to be really really good for us.

948
00:55:13,929 --> 00:55:14,429
Very nice.

949
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:23,869
Always great when you get this fill in here.

950
00:55:25,449 --> 00:55:26,050
That's so good.

951
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:39,199
You can you do a tier list about this already?

952
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,320
But Miku?

953
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,019
I don't I only know like four songs three songs from Miku.

954
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:52,780
All right, so let's go.

955
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:55,230
It's easy.

956
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:57,920
This is eight.

957
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,409
Yeah, this one.

958
00:56:03,409 --> 00:56:04,309
Wow, this one was easy.

959
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,940
It's got to get one.

960
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:10,440
Everything is just connected.

961
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,239
Everything's connected.

962
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:14,190
This one was very easy.

963
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,309
Yeah, necktie.

964
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,000
We have to check out every single picture.

965
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,800
That's what was voted on.

966
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,559
So did tier list.

967
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,860
I did every one of those already.

968
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,539
So what a tier list, please.

969
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:30,440
I already I did it already.

970
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:35,840
You guys want you guys want reruns?

971
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,440
You want me to do reruns?

972
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,880
But maybe my tastes have changed.

973
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,280
It's true.

974
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:45,389
Unlock some songs.

975
00:56:45,389 --> 00:56:45,789
All right.

976
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,619
Where do I go for that?

977
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:49,690
All right.

978
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,489
So set your favorite characters.

979
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:53,190
Oh, wait a minute.

980
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,800
Who is the characters?

981
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:02,500
What character should I have?

982
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:08,059
Maybe everyone was talking.

983
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:18,079
Everyone was saying this character Luca.

984
00:57:21,949 --> 00:57:22,250
Okay.

985
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:25,920
Puzzles on keyboard.

986
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:28,019
How to play credits sound.

987
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:28,920
All right.

988
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:29,920
How do I unlock songs?

989
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:34,309
Special music.

990
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:35,309
All right, unlock new songs.

991
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:36,409
How much money do I have?

992
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:38,989
I have 26 cents.

993
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:40,699
How much is this?

994
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,210
How much does it cost to unlock?

995
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:49,880
What song should I unlock?

996
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,079
I don't know what songs are.

997
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,409
Do you see anything you like?

998
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:05,960
Where's uh, where's that?

999
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:16,599
Is it here?

1000
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:18,449
It's called peep.

1001
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:19,849
Oh people.

1002
00:58:20,349 --> 00:58:21,150
Oh people.

1003
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,360
Is it here?

1004
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:32,730
That one.

1005
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:35,130
I mean, I it's like a five second delay.

1006
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:42,480
Which one?

1007
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:46,579
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna do this one.

1008
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:03,510
All right.

1009
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:06,010
How about 393 150?

1010
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,239
Shuffle.

1011
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:19,579
Okay, this one sounds pretty good.

1012
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:28,400
The butterfly on your shoulder.

1013
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:31,070
Now it's the chair.

1014
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,460
How about this one?

1015
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:43,530
I was already laughing.

1016
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,480
I need more stars.

1017
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:52,679
All right.

1018
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:53,480
We have it on shuffle.

1019
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:55,849
We got it on shuffle.

1020
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:04,159
This is I like this.

1021
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:04,860
This is relaxed.

1022
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:07,300
You're 42.

1023
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:11,170
Not no, I'm not close, but I'm not getting there.

1024
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,199
Wait, why is this playing?

1025
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,300
What?

1026
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:20,900
Reset it.

1027
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,199
It's eight.

1028
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:22,800
Oh, it's eight.

1029
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,000
Eight.

1030
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,400
I'm an idiot.

1031
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:31,349
I went too far down.

1032
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,590
What a fly on your shoulder is the song name.

1033
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:39,789
Oh, well, I looked over and I see this.

1034
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:41,730
I was like that.

1035
01:00:41,829 --> 01:00:42,429
What is that?

1036
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:45,429
Oh, I really genuinely thought you meant that.

1037
01:00:46,130 --> 01:01:00,530
This one should be another easy one.

1038
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:02,289
I think so.

1039
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:02,989
Yeah, it will be.

1040
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:03,389
Look at this.

1041
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:04,289
Love it.

1042
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:10,139
Perfect.

1043
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,440
I mean, I want to say it's right here.

1044
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:15,739
Kind of has to be.

1045
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:37,460
Okay, so four.

1046
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:38,760
Very cool.

1047
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,159
Two.

1048
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:40,659
Nice.

1049
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,260
Four.

1050
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:42,159
Nice.

1051
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,360
One.

1052
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,630
Nice.

1053
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,429
Three.

1054
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:45,829
Done.

1055
01:01:47,929 --> 01:01:49,030
This is also a one.

1056
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:52,880
So it has to be here.

1057
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:55,679
It's also one.

1058
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,280
It has to be here.

1059
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,019
This is the six.

1060
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:05,219
So I mean, even if it's one, two, three, four, five, six, it has to be there.

1061
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:08,699
And it has to be here.

1062
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,000
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

1063
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,199
I pressed the button a little too much.

1064
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:14,960
But actually that's fine.

1065
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,360
Okay.

1066
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:28,960
Nice.

1067
01:02:30,889 --> 01:02:32,289
Jeremy, can you cover yourself in oil?

1068
01:02:35,309 --> 01:02:36,809
Just like all of, what do you...

1069
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:38,639
Time that person out.

1070
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:40,909
Time that person out for like five minutes.

1071
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,500
That person needs to be timed out for like five minutes at least.

1072
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,039
When he can.

1073
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:54,449
I have to go to the settings.

1074
01:02:54,449 --> 01:02:54,650
All right.

1075
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,150
We'll do it or no.

1076
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:57,550
How you guys doing?

1077
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,650
You guys have a good, uh, I'm gonna say Halloween.

1078
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,159
You guys have a good Thanksgiving?

1079
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:09,670
This is a chill stream.

1080
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:10,070
Yeah, it is.

1081
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:20,989
Oh, all right.

1082
01:03:20,989 --> 01:03:21,789
So it's in here.

1083
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:24,190
Oh, okay.

1084
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,489
Background music settings.

1085
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:28,449
Just haven't been anything, right?

1086
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:31,289
It's gonna shuffle then.

1087
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:32,690
Oh, I have to set it.

1088
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:38,429
Will it just shuffle?

1089
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,530
Is it the only one through that I have?

1090
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:42,869
I was gonna pick this one.

1091
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:55,360
I don't celebrate.

1092
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,059
Well, if you do, then you do.

1093
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:00,280
Get at the bottom.

1094
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:03,280
How do I, um, make it so it will?

1095
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:05,829
I don't know how to do it.

1096
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:06,429
I just picked one.

1097
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:06,929
Let's see what it is.

1098
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:17,820
Is it different?

1099
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,389
Oh, okay.

1100
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,389
Ooh, this is cool.

1101
01:04:32,389 --> 01:04:33,389
I didn't mean to do that.

1102
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,289
I can't use the analog anymore.

1103
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:45,219
Six.

1104
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:47,940
This one's five.

1105
01:04:51,469 --> 01:04:52,469
Oh, this is juicy.

1106
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:52,869
Look at this.

1107
01:04:58,659 --> 01:04:59,159
This is juicy.

1108
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:13,239
That's, look at how juicy that was.

1109
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,019
Not even done either.

1110
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,230
Oh my God.

1111
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:21,829
That was juicy.

1112
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:33,099
Can't be there.

1113
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,380
Gotta be here.

1114
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:36,179
Gotta be here.

1115
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:37,280
There.

1116
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:37,780
There.

1117
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:38,579
Wait, what?

1118
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:38,880
What?

1119
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,480
What happened?

1120
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,579
Oh, I'm an idiot.

1121
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:41,380
I went too fast.

1122
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,250
I should have known because that was, that was the two.

1123
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:44,949
Well, I went too fast.

1124
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:48,269
That was juicy.

1125
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:49,369
It was juicy.

1126
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:51,519
What?

1127
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:53,360
Stop saying that.

1128
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,380
Why not?

1129
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,079
What do you mean stop?

1130
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,980
Stop saying juicy.

1131
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:02,869
What's wrong with everybody today?

1132
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:05,369
I can't say this was a juicy one.

1133
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:07,619
Why?

1134
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:15,309
You have 18,000 people watching you play Picross.

1135
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:19,440
I don't know.

1136
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:23,849
Dude, come on.

1137
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:26,250
I feel like that's like insulting to me.

1138
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:27,550
Like what?

1139
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:28,150
Is that for you?

1140
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,949
Was that an insult?

1141
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:32,789
What was that?

1142
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:33,889
Is that gonna insult?

1143
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:35,849
Oh, you think I'm funny?

1144
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:36,349
What?

1145
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:37,050
I'm funny to you?

1146
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:37,949
Well, funny how like how?

1147
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,150
Funny when I amuse you?

1148
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:40,949
Funny like a clown?

1149
01:06:40,949 --> 01:06:41,650
No, tell me.

1150
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:42,949
I want to know what you fucking mean by that.

1151
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:46,210
I should say you say funny things.

1152
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,110
I say funny things, huh?

1153
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:54,849
Well, like I amuse you.

1154
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,860
That is one of the best scenes.

1155
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,460
Like that scene is crazy.

1156
01:07:11,429 --> 01:07:12,230
Not a big deal.

1157
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:17,710
That's classic.

1158
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:18,409
That's a classic one.

1159
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:25,269
Hey, I think there's people here because it's in the title.

1160
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:29,269
How many people have eaten their Thanksgiving turkey?

1161
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:32,469
And they're on the couch just sitting there with their phone going like this.

1162
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,289
I didn't press the button.

1163
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:44,309
Here's a quick tip for you.

1164
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:47,110
If you want to know about Picross, if it's one large number,

1165
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:52,480
just count the amount it takes to get to whatever the fold of the cap here is,

1166
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,079
which is 10.

1167
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,880
And that's what's left on both sides.

1168
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:57,679
So let's say it's seven.

1169
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:00,480
You're going to leave three on both sides because seven plus three is ten.

1170
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:02,280
So therefore the middle four will be filled in.

1171
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,980
That's an easy way to do it.

1172
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,579
And for all of you that are going to be playing it later this afternoon.

1173
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:07,780
How is it?

1174
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:08,079
Whatever.

1175
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:25,619
Yeah, thanks for the tip.

1176
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:29,689
Play Professor Layton?

1177
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:30,789
No, I can't play that game.

1178
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:32,189
That game pisses me off.

1179
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:37,130
I actually get angry when I play that.

1180
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:46,689
It's just like all the all the so many of those puzzles in Layton just get so

1181
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,270
my brain just can't do it.

1182
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:50,470
I'd rather just play Picross.

1183
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,260
Okay, so can I do anything with six?

1184
01:08:57,779 --> 01:08:58,680
Six, I can.

1185
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:06,899
Again, leave four on both sides because that has to be the middle ones and therefore

1186
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:07,800
look what we just did.

1187
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:11,010
Layton is pretty tough.

1188
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:11,409
It is.

1189
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:11,710
It is.

1190
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:12,609
And that's it's fun.

1191
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:17,909
I just I get to a point in Layton where I get to the first ten puzzles and then they

1192
01:09:17,909 --> 01:09:19,210
get too hard where I go.

1193
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:20,210
I don't really care anymore.

1194
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:21,210
It was fun while it lasted.

1195
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:31,789
Oh, this is eight one.

1196
01:09:31,789 --> 01:09:45,800
Okay, that would be part of the five.

1197
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:56,310
One, two, can't be there, can't be there, can't be there.

1198
01:09:59,109 --> 01:10:03,390
So then this is interesting.

1199
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,189
One, two, three, four, five.

1200
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:08,189
One, two, three, four, five.

1201
01:10:08,189 --> 01:10:12,090
Can't quite put something here because I don't know but I could actually.

1202
01:10:13,689 --> 01:10:14,189
Yeah, I could.

1203
01:10:19,329 --> 01:10:19,829
Is it two?

1204
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:26,069
He's in music.

1205
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:27,369
Jerma, you are fucked up.

1206
01:10:27,869 --> 01:10:28,470
What did I do?

1207
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:31,770
I want you to explain to me what I did in the last 10 to 25 seconds.

1208
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:38,710
In the last 30 seconds, I did something so fucked up that you wrote that.

1209
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:39,310
But what did I do?

1210
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,609
All I've been saying is okay, so that's one, two, three, four, five.

1211
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:44,710
Okay, there it is.

1212
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:46,510
And there's two.

1213
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:48,409
What did I do that was that screwed up right there?

1214
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:49,109
I want to know.

1215
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:50,310
Tell me.

1216
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:56,319
Oh, dude, you are so fucked up.

1217
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,199
And what's your language by the way?

1218
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:21,109
That's the middle two.

1219
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:22,109
So can I go this?

1220
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:24,979
I can but I don't know that yet.

1221
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:33,449
This is obviously the two but it could be either one of these spots.

1222
01:11:33,649 --> 01:11:34,050
I don't know.

1223
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:38,090
Turn the music down.

1224
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:43,130
You understand that there are like at least a half dozen Miku fans in here that

1225
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,029
it can be very mad at me if I turn the music down.

1226
01:11:47,529 --> 01:11:48,529
At least a half dozen.

1227
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,210
You're like I'm missing something that I can do right now.

1228
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:03,960
Five?

1229
01:12:07,939 --> 01:12:08,239
Yeah.

1230
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:09,380
Okay.

1231
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,680
Well, the one is here.

1232
01:12:10,779 --> 01:12:11,479
All right, that helps.

1233
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:15,409
Two, three, four, five, six.

1234
01:12:16,909 --> 01:12:18,109
Three, four, five, six.

1235
01:12:19,729 --> 01:12:20,430
Oh, there we go.

1236
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:22,039
Nice.

1237
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,220
That has to be over here.

1238
01:12:28,659 --> 01:12:30,060
This is a one so it could be here.

1239
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,760
This is also a two so it could be here as well.

1240
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,670
Yeah, two in the top row is done.

1241
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:40,270
That's true.

1242
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:45,130
Then this five, one, two, three, four, five.

1243
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:45,829
There it is.

1244
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,619
Okay, so that's not available.

1245
01:12:50,619 --> 01:12:51,619
This is available.

1246
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:56,439
This is not four.

1247
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:57,539
This is four.

1248
01:13:00,979 --> 01:13:02,680
And now this is part of the two.

1249
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:08,000
I think it's here, but I don't know that for sure yet.

1250
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,800
So I'm not going to do it.

1251
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,819
One, two, three, four, five, five, six.

1252
01:13:14,819 --> 01:13:16,619
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1253
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:23,659
What?

1254
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:24,859
How?

1255
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,479
What did I do wrong?

1256
01:13:27,579 --> 01:13:28,380
Wait, what happened?

1257
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:31,180
Two, one.

1258
01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:32,649
Uh-oh.

1259
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:36,859
Oh, I mean I marked it wrong.

1260
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:38,560
Shit.

1261
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,460
Oh, that's what happens when you deduce wrong.

1262
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,380
Sorry, I'm good.

1263
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:52,439
You scared Luca.

1264
01:13:52,539 --> 01:13:53,840
What do you mean I scared Luca?

1265
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:58,739
Oh.

1266
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:06,109
A headset.

1267
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:06,810
That's okay.

1268
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:07,210
That's cool.

1269
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,819
Dude, this guy deduces.

1270
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,180
Sorry, I have a full plate of spaghetti over here.

1271
01:14:30,439 --> 01:14:30,939
So I changed it.

1272
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:32,340
What should I put the music to then?

1273
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,899
Because I have to set it for the puzzle background music.

1274
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,500
You guys have to pick one.

1275
01:14:41,739 --> 01:14:43,939
Which one of these should be puzzle background music?

1276
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,739
These are instrumental.

1277
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:47,239
That's why.

1278
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:47,739
Okay.

1279
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:48,939
What about this one?

1280
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,399
These are all instrumental.

1281
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:56,920
Third one.

1282
01:14:58,619 --> 01:14:59,020
May I?

1283
01:14:59,020 --> 01:14:59,819
Okay, one, two.

1284
01:14:59,819 --> 01:15:00,420
Yeah, we'll do this one.

1285
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:04,350
I don't know.

1286
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:05,449
You're the Miku expert.

1287
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,050
I'm not a Miku expert.

1288
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:13,380
Guys, I thought Miku was somebody actually singing until a year and a half ago.

1289
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:15,590
I don't know.

1290
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,590
I didn't know very much.

1291
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,439
I thought it was a gorilla's scenario.

1292
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:28,890
That just shows how much I knew.

1293
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:32,329
Somebody said it's not.

1294
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:33,130
No, it's not.

1295
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:33,729
It's a...

1296
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:36,029
It's a robot.

1297
01:15:36,829 --> 01:15:37,329
It's a...

1298
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:38,329
She's a...

1299
01:15:38,529 --> 01:15:39,529
What do they call him?

1300
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:41,029
Vocaloid?

1301
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:46,770
Yeah, she's a Vocaloid.

1302
01:15:46,869 --> 01:15:47,170
Yeah.

1303
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,619
It's that Vocaloid technology.

1304
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,399
You happy with this one?

1305
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:09,829
She's more real than you.

1306
01:16:13,479 --> 01:16:13,779
All right.

1307
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:18,430
She's more real than you.

1308
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,979
She's real to me, but sad.

1309
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,380
We're crying.

1310
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:31,609
I...

1311
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:35,470
Be mean?

1312
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:36,470
I'm not being mean?

1313
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:37,970
I didn't do anything.

1314
01:16:39,069 --> 01:16:40,869
Miku is a wonderful character.

1315
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:42,869
When did I say anything bad about Miku?

1316
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:43,369
Ever.

1317
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:44,770
Are you serious?

1318
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,020
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1319
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:07,619
Apology with tears.

1320
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,220
I didn't say anything.

1321
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:23,590
Hey, go make an open-faced turkey sandwich.

1322
01:17:25,329 --> 01:17:27,229
You just made 18,000 people cry.

1323
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:31,119
I'm playing my game.

1324
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,020
Everybody chill out.

1325
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:33,720
It's Thanksgiving.

1326
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:36,430
One, two, three.

1327
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:37,529
Can't be any of these.

1328
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:38,729
I love when it does this.

1329
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:42,829
So this is...

1330
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:43,130
All right.

1331
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:43,729
So here we go.

1332
01:17:45,779 --> 01:17:47,880
So that means one, two, three, four, five, six.

1333
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:49,180
Has to be in here.

1334
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:49,579
Is it that?

1335
01:17:49,579 --> 01:17:50,380
Do I have it already?

1336
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,359
That's pretty close.

1337
01:17:57,859 --> 01:17:59,060
Is this the three or the two?

1338
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:04,300
This has to be the three, right?

1339
01:18:06,579 --> 01:18:07,279
Why are you so mean?

1340
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:17,060
If I get this, then it's good to go.

1341
01:18:18,859 --> 01:18:20,060
I didn't say you say sorry to Miku.

1342
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,859
I'm sorry, Miku.

1343
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,359
There you go.

1344
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,260
Now tell me if I'm right.

1345
01:18:26,859 --> 01:18:27,560
I think it's the...

1346
01:18:28,359 --> 01:18:28,960
It's the three.

1347
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:29,159
Yeah.

1348
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,239
The two?

1349
01:18:32,739 --> 01:18:33,239
Where would the...

1350
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:33,739
No.

1351
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:45,090
Oh my God.

1352
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:45,390
All right.

1353
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,890
So this is obviously part of the three.

1354
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:47,390
So this is...

1355
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,890
I can do a lot of deduction here.

1356
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,949
One, two, three, face one.

1357
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,520
One, two, three, four.

1358
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:07,100
One, two, three, four.

1359
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,699
I don't know if that's correct or not.

1360
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,199
This is...

1361
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,000
Probably the six.

1362
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,239
I wanted to press the other button.

1363
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,079
Can you please do an ASMR stream?

1364
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:23,479
Yeah, sure.

1365
01:19:23,479 --> 01:19:24,680
Let me just get a little bit more of my spaghetti.

1366
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,359
I wanted to press the other button.

1367
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:41,439
Why is it so wet?

1368
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,739
I have to put extra sauce on it.

1369
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,739
My spaghetti sits in at least two or three inches of sauce.

1370
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:51,930
And then when I'm done, I tip it up like this and I drink it.

1371
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,800
Do you really think I do that?

1372
01:20:14,199 --> 01:20:14,899
Be honest with yourself.

1373
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,470
Sit here and think.

1374
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,069
What does your eyes have to do?

1375
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:19,670
You say...

1376
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:22,340
Does a person actually do that?

1377
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:23,699
No.

1378
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,000
No, but no way.

1379
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,180
Glad we could figure this out together.

1380
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:34,079
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

1381
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:34,279
No.

1382
01:20:34,279 --> 01:20:35,079
Oh, I think I got it.

1383
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:38,140
This has to be there.

1384
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,439
That helps a lot.

1385
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:53,899
Cool.

1386
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,149
What are you talking about?

1387
01:20:56,149 --> 01:20:57,250
I've got three X's.

1388
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:00,909
I'm trying to go too fast.

1389
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:04,659
Somebody said, what is that?

1390
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:05,260
Copypasta?

1391
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:05,960
I'm not going to read it.

1392
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,260
What about smelling me or something?

1393
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:07,560
Whatever.

1394
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:09,569
All right.

1395
01:21:09,569 --> 01:21:10,270
So this is the...

1396
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:11,970
Two is right here.

1397
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:24,159
All right.

1398
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:24,859
We got it now.

1399
01:21:30,369 --> 01:21:34,720
One, one, four, three.

1400
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:35,619
There it is.

1401
01:21:35,619 --> 01:21:35,819
All right.

1402
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:36,720
I got a lot of X's.

1403
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:40,079
Don't read it.

1404
01:21:51,899 --> 01:21:52,800
I think I can get a new song.

1405
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,109
I mean, the mods are just sniping it.

1406
01:21:57,109 --> 01:21:59,609
So I really probably shouldn't read it.

1407
01:21:59,609 --> 01:22:00,409
I'm not going to read it.

1408
01:22:02,659 --> 01:22:04,859
It's not going to read it because it's like as weird.

1409
01:22:07,819 --> 01:22:08,619
I need a new song.

1410
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:09,119
I need some help.

1411
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:14,810
I think I have enough.

1412
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,199
Is particle miracle any good?

1413
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,539
You're a weird guy.

1414
01:22:22,539 --> 01:22:22,939
Read it.

1415
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,039
You could be kind of a weird guy and not be kind of a gross guy.

1416
01:22:33,079 --> 01:22:33,579
Is this one good?

1417
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:45,180
What about coloring?

1418
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:45,880
I'll do this one.

1419
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,300
I already own this.

1420
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:49,899
What?

1421
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:54,039
I already have this one already.

1422
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:01,060
What about by your side?

1423
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:05,699
Oh, why was that locked?

1424
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:06,300
I already have it.

1425
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:16,069
I actually like this one.

1426
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:17,770
It'd be a puzzle background.

1427
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:28,130
I think this one's kind of cool.

1428
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:33,470
I'll do this one.

1429
01:23:40,939 --> 01:23:41,739
Yeah, I'll keep this one.

1430
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:44,850
These songs are really obscure.

1431
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,260
What a special complete one large artwork.

1432
01:23:53,869 --> 01:23:55,369
Well, let's clear this whole thing first.

1433
01:24:00,779 --> 01:24:01,880
They're very obscure.

1434
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:02,279
Really?

1435
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:12,899
Whoops.

1436
01:24:12,899 --> 01:24:13,800
I went with the garbage one.

1437
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:17,659
There are another nine.

1438
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:18,560
Seven are here.

1439
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:22,350
Any other big ones?

1440
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:23,050
The six.

1441
01:24:24,789 --> 01:24:25,689
Another six.

1442
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:31,189
Remember that it has to be here because just of absolute standard deduction.

1443
01:24:33,789 --> 01:24:34,689
Any more big ones?

1444
01:24:37,069 --> 01:24:38,569
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1445
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:39,869
Now I can get that in a minute.

1446
01:24:39,869 --> 01:24:40,069
All right.

1447
01:24:40,069 --> 01:24:40,670
Let's go for it.

1448
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:02,210
But what did I do wrong?

1449
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:02,710
I got it right.

1450
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:05,359
Stop.

1451
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:05,960
Stop what?

1452
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,760
This is pretty good popcorn scream.

1453
01:25:09,859 --> 01:25:10,659
That's pretty cool.

1454
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:12,359
You made a fresh thing of popcorn?

1455
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:13,829
Cool.

1456
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,800
Fresh popcorn is the best.

1457
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,600
And nothing beats.

1458
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:41,979
You know what?

1459
01:25:41,979 --> 01:25:44,979
I really do love just sort of carnival food.

1460
01:25:47,939 --> 01:25:48,640
Popcorn.

1461
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:49,939
Fresh pop.

1462
01:25:51,239 --> 01:25:52,340
It's not much that's better.

1463
01:25:54,109 --> 01:25:55,310
The stuff in the microwave is good.

1464
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:55,909
It's fine.

1465
01:25:56,510 --> 01:26:01,310
But when you're at a fair and that machine is just bacon.

1466
01:26:01,909 --> 01:26:07,109
You wash the little pan bubble over and it fills up.

1467
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:08,409
They get the big scooper.

1468
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:09,409
It's hot.

1469
01:26:10,510 --> 01:26:11,710
That's like you have a clown diet.

1470
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:13,939
I don't eat good.

1471
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:15,800
It's fun.

1472
01:26:15,899 --> 01:26:16,399
It's good.

1473
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I just don't eat it every day.

1474
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:25,239
I actually prefer bear slash carnival popcorn over movie theater popcorn.

1475
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,710
Movie theater popcorn is a little way down for me.

1476
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:32,609
It's a little too oily and too much greasy in a way.

1477
01:26:32,609 --> 01:26:33,710
It's like too much.

1478
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:37,310
The pop stuff at the carnival is light.

1479
01:26:37,909 --> 01:26:39,109
It's nice and salty and hot.

1480
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:43,409
It's not as way down as movie theater butter tastes.

1481
01:26:50,699 --> 01:26:52,899
That's not to say I don't like movie theater popcorn.

1482
01:26:52,899 --> 01:26:53,199
I do.

1483
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,699
I love it, but I never eat it all.

1484
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:58,800
I always try to get a small and you just kind of like blah.

1485
01:26:58,899 --> 01:27:01,300
Like just eating like a pad of butter.

1486
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:05,680
I don't like sweet popcorn.

1487
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:06,579
Not really.

1488
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:12,439
There are some things that I just do not like to be sweet popcorn is one of them.

1489
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:17,680
And I know that there's a lot of you know, it could be both right?

1490
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,579
There's a lot of things like that, but I don't I'm not into it.

1491
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:29,500
I've had obviously caramel popcorn before and it's good, but I would not put it anywhere even close to regular popcorn.

1492
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:32,380
This is the one of the two.

1493
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:34,750
This is probably the one I'm going for it.

1494
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:35,449
I was wrong.

1495
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,020
That's a stupid move.

1496
01:27:54,449 --> 01:27:55,149
Actually kind of helped.

1497
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,039
What is it?

1498
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:03,960
Choker.

1499
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:06,220
Gallery.

1500
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,899
What about kettle corn?

1501
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,880
Um, I don't think I've had like, I don't know.

1502
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:16,180
The real kettle corn is just sugary, right?

1503
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:25,340
It's just sweet sugary.

1504
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:26,640
A little salty too.

1505
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,140
It's like both.

1506
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:37,560
Yeah.

1507
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:38,359
Are we going to probably move in?

1508
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,159
Are these 15?

1509
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:40,060
All right.

1510
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:41,060
There's a lot of 10 by 10s.

1511
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:41,960
When's the, when do you get to?

1512
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:42,560
All right.

1513
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,659
Actually, I might be able to do most of these.

1514
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,069
I don't have a time limit for the stream, but I just was going to hang out for three hours.

1515
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:53,369
Whenever I'm just kind of done.

1516
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,199
I don't know.

1517
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,600
I like this idea of just kind of a strip.

1518
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,199
I don't, I don't know.

1519
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:03,640
I want to try this thing where streams don't have to be like six, seven hours long.

1520
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:05,939
Like five, six, seven hours long.

1521
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:08,680
I can just do them whenever.

1522
01:29:08,979 --> 01:29:11,180
Just maybe they're shorter, but just do them whenever.

1523
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:13,310
No, I'm not leaving yet.

1524
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,199
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1525
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:22,399
Okay.

1526
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:23,000
So I can do this.

1527
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:28,380
It's very good.

1528
01:29:37,899 --> 01:29:39,100
You made her sad.

1529
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:39,800
Apologize.

1530
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:47,340
Okay.

1531
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,039
This is four.

1532
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,039
It can only be here.

1533
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:52,069
I'm going so fast.

1534
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:53,170
Look at how, look at how happy she is.

1535
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:31,020
Maybe one or two.

1536
01:30:36,369 --> 01:30:37,170
That was pretty flawless.

1537
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:40,579
My mom loves Jerma.

1538
01:30:44,329 --> 01:30:51,180
Um, if your mom doesn't think I'm bad or anything.

1539
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,500
I didn't stay on this for very long.

1540
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:06,260
My mom is a fan of you.

1541
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:07,159
Really?

1542
01:31:07,659 --> 01:31:08,460
My mom hates you.

1543
01:31:08,859 --> 01:31:09,560
I have a feeling.

1544
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:13,060
I don't know what the moms love him.

1545
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:20,279
Well, I will say this.

1546
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:24,380
If you have a relationship with your parents or your mother where you can

1547
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:28,079
both enjoy the same thing, potentially enjoy the same media.

1548
01:31:29,449 --> 01:31:31,149
That's actually pretty, that's pretty awesome.

1549
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:33,050
That's really, really nice.

1550
01:31:33,949 --> 01:31:34,449
That's sweet.

1551
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:35,050
It is.

1552
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:39,649
So that makes me kind of happy that you can kind of enjoy things

1553
01:31:39,649 --> 01:31:40,550
as you know, together.

1554
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:43,000
That's pretty cool.

1555
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:48,359
All right.

1556
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:49,659
Seven, eight, nine.

1557
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:14,319
All right.

1558
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:18,060
So six, seven, we can do a lot here.

1559
01:32:19,130 --> 01:32:20,130
I don't want to get it wrong.

1560
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,020
Two, three, four.

1561
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,619
One, two, three, four.

1562
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,359
Well, here's your five.

1563
01:32:58,189 --> 01:32:59,279
Five.

1564
01:32:59,380 --> 01:32:59,979
Here's your two.

1565
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:03,149
Here's your four.

1566
01:33:03,649 --> 01:33:04,350
Here comes your three.

1567
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:06,850
This is your six.

1568
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:08,739
Here's your four.

1569
01:33:10,539 --> 01:33:11,739
This is part of your three, obviously.

1570
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,640
This is part of your four.

1571
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:20,489
Here's your three.

1572
01:33:20,989 --> 01:33:21,590
Here's your two.

1573
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:26,289
They're your reptile eyes.

1574
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:27,720
I'm a human.

1575
01:33:39,409 --> 01:33:41,710
Dude, when you just get in the zone on some of them, it's awesome.

1576
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:42,609
Feels so good.

1577
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:13,270
I don't know that yet.

1578
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:22,479
Can you please do a Bernie Sanders impression?

1579
01:34:23,539 --> 01:34:25,340
Uh, no, it's a chill day.

1580
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:26,279
Chillin' out.

1581
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:30,000
No human likes Picross this much.

1582
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:32,960
Can I ask you a question?

1583
01:34:36,109 --> 01:34:41,729
On the Sunday paper, when you pick it up and you do the crossword

1584
01:34:41,729 --> 01:34:45,510
every weekend, does that make you a weirdo?

1585
01:34:47,239 --> 01:34:50,039
Hundreds of millions of people that do crossword every week.

1586
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:55,779
Hold on a minute.

1587
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:58,180
Let me, let me get this, let me get this for your generation.

1588
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:03,180
When you open up Wordle every day, still human?

1589
01:35:05,050 --> 01:35:05,850
You still human?

1590
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,149
Hmm.

1591
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,680
I don't play Wordle nearly as much as you do.

1592
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,279
I got Picross that I play every, you know, every few weeks.

1593
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:18,680
Maybe I'll jump on and do a game.

1594
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,680
You do Wordle every day.

1595
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:22,279
Still human?

1596
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:42,359
People play, what is it, people play it all the time.

1597
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:45,710
Well, okay.

1598
01:35:45,810 --> 01:35:48,210
Everybody was giving me shit earlier for not reading.

1599
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:53,710
But this is very clearly a game of logic and reasoning and deduction

1600
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:54,909
and making your brain work.

1601
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:56,109
How, why is this a bad thing?

1602
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:01,859
Well, I'm not, I'm not playing Call of Duty today.

1603
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:09,140
I'm not playing, I'm not playing the FPS Call of Duty game.

1604
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:09,939
Therefore what?

1605
01:36:12,039 --> 01:36:14,439
No, we're deduced, we're deducting today.

1606
01:36:24,739 --> 01:36:27,140
All right, let me restart because somebody called me a red-filled

1607
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:29,439
Redditor and I don't even like, what is that even supposed to mean?

1608
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,750
All right, we can do this.

1609
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,279
I don't know why that's doing it.

1610
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:54,479
That's just like making me laugh.

1611
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:55,180
I don't know why.

1612
01:36:58,770 --> 01:36:59,970
Red-filled Redditor.

1613
01:37:02,989 --> 01:37:04,789
That sounds like such a shitty superhero name.

1614
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:17,140
Happy Turkey Day.

1615
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:18,039
Yeah, YouTube.

1616
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,500
With this X being here, I think I can do the left side, but I just,

1617
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:27,600
my brain's too small to do it.

1618
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:39,590
This is definitely the two.

1619
01:37:53,189 --> 01:37:53,789
Can you stand up?

1620
01:37:53,789 --> 01:37:53,989
No.

1621
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,520
No, no, I'm not going to stand up.

1622
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:19,630
No, why?

1623
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:20,729
I'm not, I'm not doing that.

1624
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:22,729
No, I've had this nightmare like five times.

1625
01:38:22,729 --> 01:38:23,229
I'm not doing it.

1626
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:26,279
I've had this nightmare five times.

1627
01:38:26,579 --> 01:38:27,579
I keep having this dream.

1628
01:38:27,579 --> 01:38:28,380
I'm not doing it.

1629
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:29,180
I'm not standing up.

1630
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,520
What's your opinion on Dr.

1631
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,020
Pepper flavored baked beans?

1632
01:38:48,819 --> 01:38:49,420
That's weird.

1633
01:38:49,819 --> 01:38:52,619
I don't have an opinion on it, but my first initial reaction is

1634
01:38:52,619 --> 01:38:53,420
that's a little strange.

1635
01:38:55,939 --> 01:38:56,939
Probably all I have for you though.

1636
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:23,180
Is he actually naked or is this hinting at it?

1637
01:39:23,479 --> 01:39:24,279
No, I do.

1638
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:26,079
Okay, I'll stand off.

1639
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:26,680
Whatever.

1640
01:39:28,069 --> 01:39:28,569
I have pain.

1641
01:39:28,569 --> 01:39:30,869
I'm just, I don't know if I've had this nightmare.

1642
01:39:31,569 --> 01:39:32,670
I'm letting the nightmares happening.

1643
01:39:33,930 --> 01:39:35,029
What if the nightmare happens?

1644
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:38,229
What if the nightmare actually happens?

1645
01:39:38,529 --> 01:39:38,829
Hold on.

1646
01:39:38,829 --> 01:39:39,729
I'm turning the camera off.

1647
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:47,390
No, this is like, this is a nightmare.

1648
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,069
All right, standing up.

1649
01:39:55,529 --> 01:39:56,029
Standing up.

1650
01:39:57,319 --> 01:39:57,720
Come up.

1651
01:40:00,829 --> 01:40:01,630
I'm, I stood up.

1652
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,100
You're short.

1653
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:10,970
I didn't stand up all the way.

1654
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:12,640
Throw your pants.

1655
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,539
No, you don't need to see my pants.

1656
01:40:14,939 --> 01:40:16,039
You just need to know that they exist.

1657
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:19,109
You, I'm burning time here.

1658
01:40:19,109 --> 01:40:20,210
I could have done this in three minutes.

1659
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:24,739
Nice pit stains.

1660
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:28,189
Shut up.

1661
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:31,250
What's going on?

1662
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,560
I told you I just burned fuel.

1663
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:40,560
And I don't know.

1664
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,060
I just do.

1665
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,699
I feel like there's like two or three just little people in my

1666
01:40:53,699 --> 01:40:56,300
body shoveling coal into a furnace.

1667
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,100
And that's like how I, that's how I function.

1668
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,399
There's just three little like, like people just shoveling fucking

1669
01:41:03,399 --> 01:41:06,300
coal into a furnace and that's how I like, I operate.

1670
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:13,420
My body is like an old train from like the sift 1700s.

1671
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,890
Right here, but it might not be.

1672
01:41:31,229 --> 01:41:31,729
It is right there.

1673
01:41:35,479 --> 01:41:36,079
What was this one?

1674
01:41:38,739 --> 01:41:39,739
Do you heat your house up?

1675
01:41:41,579 --> 01:41:45,680
I, it just gets so hot in here because this computer over here,

1676
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:46,680
obviously when you're streaming.

1677
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,380
So when this computer is live and I'm live to the internet, like

1678
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:57,220
I am right now, this thing has to, it's encoding every frame that

1679
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:00,920
you're seeing and putting it out essentially like uploading it to

1680
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:03,619
the server and coding a shitload of data.

1681
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:08,520
So this computer is just sitting here, just calculating and pumping

1682
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:14,189
out hot air and I could like, yeah, I could get, I have like

1683
01:42:14,189 --> 01:42:18,909
air conditioning and everything, but, and I'm telling you right

1684
01:42:18,909 --> 01:42:20,409
now, I'm not going to open a window.

1685
01:42:20,810 --> 01:42:21,810
You just open the window.

1686
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:28,000
I have my windows just wide open while I'm sitting here talking

1687
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:34,300
about like, oh yeah, I'm a red pill redditor and oh yeah, spaghetti.

1688
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:38,899
I, that would not go, I don't want that just broadcasted out to

1689
01:42:38,899 --> 01:42:41,100
like the fucking neighbors.

1690
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:42,699
Be serious.

1691
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,460
No, these windows stay closed.

1692
01:42:49,619 --> 01:42:51,720
These windows stay very tightly closed.

1693
01:42:53,079 --> 01:42:53,880
This is a whole house.

1694
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:04,939
You're broadcasting to 20,000 people.

1695
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:05,640
Yeah.

1696
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:08,039
Those 20,000 people have chosen to be here.

1697
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:14,399
If a random neighbor in like, I don't know, like an apartment

1698
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:17,500
complex or a house or a neighborhood, they didn't sign up to

1699
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,300
hear you talk about how you shit your pants today.

1700
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:21,760
They did not sign up for that.

1701
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:26,449
So I don't want my, all my windows to be up well.

1702
01:43:26,449 --> 01:43:31,949
I'm just like, oh, what the fuck is that guy doing?

1703
01:43:32,449 --> 01:43:33,750
What is that guy doing?

1704
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:35,750
Why is Boise like this?

1705
01:43:48,149 --> 01:43:50,149
That's why you, it's a chill stream.

1706
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:51,250
It is, it is a chill stream.

1707
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,000
17,000 people already seeing you do that.

1708
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,100
I know, but you are here because you chose to be here.

1709
01:44:03,699 --> 01:44:05,000
You clicked on my stream.

1710
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:07,369
You're not reading a book.

1711
01:44:08,350 --> 01:44:11,050
You're not reading a book in, in your, in your like place.

1712
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:13,350
Just being like, oh yeah, this is a really relaxing day.

1713
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:15,149
I'm going to keep, I'm going to put the window open today.

1714
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:16,449
That's nice out.

1715
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:24,069
No, no, no, no, I don't want to show my dick on camera.

1716
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:26,470
I don't want to show my dick on camera.

1717
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:30,770
What is that person doing?

1718
01:44:32,590 --> 01:44:33,489
Why is windows open?

1719
01:44:33,489 --> 01:44:34,590
Why is he screening this stuff?

1720
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:37,260
These windows are open.

1721
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:39,960
He's yelling these random things.

1722
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:43,260
What could he possibly, what could you possibly be doing?

1723
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:47,319
Oh yeah.

1724
01:44:47,319 --> 01:44:47,920
No, no, yeah.

1725
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,720
Cause let me open up all my windows and just start, you know.

1726
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:56,399
How many baseballs can I fit in my ass?

1727
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,100
Oh, time that person out, ban that person.

1728
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,800
Ban that person for a day.

1729
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:08,100
No, not happening.

1730
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:15,529
It's a chill stream, everybody.

1731
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,449
Same reason if I feel like I'm singing.

1732
01:45:32,149 --> 01:45:34,850
If I ever sing in the car, let's say I have music playing a little bit

1733
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:36,350
or I'm like, just sitting there like singing.

1734
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:39,949
If I was singing this song, those windows are up.

1735
01:45:40,649 --> 01:45:43,550
There is no way I'm going to pull to a red light and be like,

1736
01:45:47,449 --> 01:45:49,250
whoa, that guy's singing.

1737
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,250
That guy's singing.

1738
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:51,149
That guy's singing.

1739
01:45:52,149 --> 01:45:53,149
How is it any different?

1740
01:45:57,239 --> 01:45:58,340
Can you tell me how that's different?

1741
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:03,270
I know for a fact, a ton of people that do that, that all of a sudden,

1742
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:05,270
oh no, I'm going to pull up to the red light.

1743
01:46:05,670 --> 01:46:06,069
It's like,

1744
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:10,369
I'm slowing down to the red light.

1745
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:19,210
The screen.

1746
01:46:21,079 --> 01:46:23,579
And now we go back to what we were doing.

1747
01:46:23,779 --> 01:46:24,279
Come on.

1748
01:46:24,979 --> 01:46:26,479
You can't give me shit for this one.

1749
01:46:28,789 --> 01:46:30,189
Don't even start with that.

1750
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:47,310
This guy's only filled in four squares in three minutes.

1751
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:51,680
Hey, how was your Thanksgiving?

1752
01:46:55,859 --> 01:46:56,060
All right.

1753
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:57,260
Now I'm going to focus and I'm going to get it done.

1754
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:57,859
Just relax.

1755
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:08,460
What can I fill in?

1756
01:47:10,739 --> 01:47:12,140
Three, four, five, six, seven.

1757
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:13,439
Oh, I can do this.

1758
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:14,140
Probably wait.

1759
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:18,329
All right.

1760
01:47:18,329 --> 01:47:18,930
I'm focused now.

1761
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:30,479
What's a lot of low numbers.

1762
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:34,520
But I just, what am I doing?

1763
01:47:35,529 --> 01:47:42,729
Right bumper did that one space.

1764
01:47:43,829 --> 01:47:44,529
I don't want to guess.

1765
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,609
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

1766
01:47:48,609 --> 01:47:53,260
So this and okay.

1767
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:55,760
This is the three.

1768
01:47:57,659 --> 01:47:58,060
Yeah.

1769
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:01,159
So here one, two, three.

1770
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:12,859
All right.

1771
01:48:12,859 --> 01:48:17,159
So now that I know this, this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1772
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,659
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1773
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:23,779
Oh, this is the one.

1774
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:24,479
Nice.

1775
01:48:27,819 --> 01:48:30,100
You that's free.

1776
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:42,880
This is an animal crossing song.

1777
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:44,380
What is, hold on.

1778
01:48:44,479 --> 01:48:44,979
What did you say?

1779
01:48:44,979 --> 01:48:47,479
What is this animal crossing ass song?

1780
01:48:49,359 --> 01:48:51,260
It's this is Miku.

1781
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:25,399
I was like, all right, ban him for a minute.

1782
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:26,300
Ban him for a minute.

1783
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:26,500
Time.

1784
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,199
I'm up for five minutes.

1785
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:33,500
I am really giggly today.

1786
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:34,000
You're right.

1787
01:49:39,569 --> 01:49:39,970
Shit.

1788
01:49:39,970 --> 01:49:40,670
I have to stop.

1789
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:41,369
It's tough.

1790
01:49:41,369 --> 01:49:42,270
I keep fucking up.

1791
01:49:42,970 --> 01:49:45,970
I just imagine somebody coming to the stream and just they've never

1792
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:47,270
heard anything like this before.

1793
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,100
Like what would you, what would you honestly think?

1794
01:49:50,899 --> 01:49:52,600
Like I've never heard a Miku song.

1795
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,100
I have played animal crossing.

1796
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:54,899
That's what I know.

1797
01:49:54,899 --> 01:49:55,699
That's what I have up here.

1798
01:49:55,699 --> 01:49:56,399
That's what I know.

1799
01:49:58,399 --> 01:49:58,899
What is it?

1800
01:49:58,899 --> 01:50:00,500
Like what is the song that I'm listening to?

1801
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:15,300
All right.

1802
01:50:15,300 --> 01:50:16,699
I got to get, I got to get it together here.

1803
01:50:31,489 --> 01:50:33,189
Miku and Animal Crossing fans are the same.

1804
01:50:36,619 --> 01:50:37,920
They probably share a pretty big audience.

1805
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:39,630
They're both fun.

1806
01:50:39,930 --> 01:50:40,630
Both cool.

1807
01:51:02,819 --> 01:51:03,319
I don't know yet.

1808
01:51:07,109 --> 01:51:07,909
All right, that helps.

1809
01:51:20,149 --> 01:51:20,350
All right.

1810
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:21,149
So nothing else here.

1811
01:51:21,149 --> 01:51:24,340
So this is it has to be there.

1812
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,000
What is it?

1813
01:51:29,029 --> 01:51:30,029
Paper tags.

1814
01:51:39,739 --> 01:51:40,140
New song.

1815
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:40,539
All right.

1816
01:51:49,659 --> 01:51:50,460
This is a fun game.

1817
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:53,560
I'm going to do particle miracle.

1818
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:58,500
I regret my purchase.

1819
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:01,899
Hold on.

1820
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:07,909
Nevermind.

1821
01:52:14,930 --> 01:52:16,729
This is going on the puzzle part.

1822
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:20,699
I thought, okay.

1823
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:22,199
People like what am I and what the fuck?

1824
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:22,500
What do you mean?

1825
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:26,399
I thought it was an instrumental and I didn't want to buy an instrumental.

1826
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:29,239
Song is fine.

1827
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:29,939
Song is good.

1828
01:52:30,739 --> 01:52:31,840
I just thought it was an instrumental.

1829
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:55,029
How do I feel about, how do I feel about visual novels?

1830
01:52:55,329 --> 01:52:56,729
I don't think I've ever done one.

1831
01:53:01,399 --> 01:53:03,199
What, what, what constitutes a visual novel?

1832
01:53:04,689 --> 01:53:05,390
Have I done one before?

1833
01:53:18,979 --> 01:53:19,680
Ace Attorney.

1834
01:53:19,979 --> 01:53:21,279
I told you I can't play Ace Attorney.

1835
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:25,439
I physically cannot play it again.

1836
01:53:26,039 --> 01:53:27,229
I can't.

1837
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:33,810
Why, why not?

1838
01:53:35,010 --> 01:53:35,210
All right.

1839
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:37,310
We're going to explain this to some of the newer audience.

1840
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:45,989
So every, I want to say every like every like 10 seconds to one minute.

1841
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:53,859
The screen goes and flashes a white flash in your face.

1842
01:53:54,859 --> 01:53:56,560
Does this every 10 to 15 seconds.

1843
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:01,800
And it's just like.

1844
01:54:02,939 --> 01:54:05,340
And here's my head and you can't turn it off.

1845
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:17,239
It's not true.

1846
01:54:17,239 --> 01:54:17,640
It is true.

1847
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:21,880
You know how I know it's true because I bought the entire Ace Attorney

1848
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:24,180
remake when it came out because everyone was telling me I should be

1849
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:27,880
playing it and I was so excited about it and I went in and it just

1850
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:29,279
did the, it still was doing it.

1851
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:35,500
All right.

1852
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:36,199
I can get this here.

1853
01:54:42,970 --> 01:54:43,970
I can do this one too, I think.

1854
01:54:45,689 --> 01:54:47,390
Play romance games, please.

1855
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:50,689
Remember you're balding more on your right side than your left.

1856
01:54:50,689 --> 01:54:51,489
That's not true.

1857
01:54:51,989 --> 01:54:54,390
What's happening with your, with your being, when you're experiencing,

1858
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:56,890
I'll tell you, here's what you are experiencing.

1859
01:54:57,689 --> 01:55:00,619
You're experiencing my hair.

1860
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:02,720
My hairline is here, right?

1861
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,720
Like I'm, I just pulled it over.

1862
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:09,619
My hairline is right here, but my hairstyle is kind of, I have wavy hair.

1863
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:13,119
So my actual hairline is that, right?

1864
01:55:13,619 --> 01:55:16,819
What you're just, what you're seeing is you're seeing how it falls on one side.

1865
01:55:16,819 --> 01:55:19,220
So therefore you think I'm balding on one side, but not the other, but just

1866
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:20,520
my hair is wavy and goes like that.

1867
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:22,319
I also need a haircut.

1868
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:27,319
So like this mad scientist shit back here is, should be like that.

1869
01:55:27,619 --> 01:55:28,619
And this should be a little shorter.

1870
01:55:31,539 --> 01:55:33,739
Also, I've been fucking banned for one day.

1871
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,560
Oh, that does that.

1872
01:56:06,489 --> 01:56:07,890
Ooh, this is, I like this part.

1873
01:56:16,079 --> 01:56:17,380
There's a lot of the three two threes.

1874
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:19,189
Just realized that.

1875
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:28,520
It's great.

1876
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,159
Six.

1877
01:56:34,699 --> 01:56:35,100
Again.

1878
01:56:38,279 --> 01:56:38,979
You should grow it out.

1879
01:56:38,979 --> 01:56:39,579
No.

1880
01:56:41,819 --> 01:56:42,520
Ow.

1881
01:56:43,810 --> 01:56:44,609
I like it like this.

1882
01:56:45,310 --> 01:56:46,310
If it stays like this, it's fine.

1883
01:56:47,420 --> 01:56:50,949
Having the, let's say medium length hair.

1884
01:56:51,449 --> 01:56:53,250
It's I need to, I got to clean it up though.

1885
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:54,449
It's a little sloppy.

1886
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:55,750
I don't know why I said haircuts.

1887
01:57:05,079 --> 01:57:06,880
Oh, you can sort it by character.

1888
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:09,560
Can you?

1889
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:19,109
Please go back to the Hillary Clinton hair.

1890
01:57:30,189 --> 01:57:31,489
That's never happening ever again.

1891
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:35,979
All right.

1892
01:57:35,979 --> 01:57:36,779
What should I buy now?

1893
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:38,119
What's this one?

1894
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:39,880
I need more.

1895
01:57:41,779 --> 01:57:44,180
I think I have most of them on shuffle, but I don't think it matters.

1896
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:50,180
I think the shuffle mode stuff, I think that's just in this menu.

1897
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:56,119
If I press play on this, it's going to shuffle in this menu, not in the game.

1898
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:02,840
How come you try to specifically like 10 seconds behind?

1899
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:04,470
I don't know.

1900
01:58:04,470 --> 01:58:05,470
Maybe it's your connection to me.

1901
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:07,949
I think that's how it works.

1902
01:58:07,949 --> 01:58:08,250
Right.

1903
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,100
Like I'm West coast United States.

1904
01:58:12,899 --> 01:58:16,520
So maybe if you're, I don't know if you're connecting from putting it out,

1905
01:58:16,619 --> 01:58:19,720
broadcasting to you in Europe or something, maybe it's a little behind.

1906
01:58:26,449 --> 01:58:26,750
I don't know.

1907
01:58:28,779 --> 01:58:29,180
Please.

1908
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:32,010
Popeye is in the list and the music done.

1909
01:58:37,470 --> 01:58:40,810
I, uh, I can we get a, um, make it a poll.

1910
01:58:40,810 --> 01:58:42,310
Should I turn the music down another notch?

1911
01:58:45,170 --> 01:58:46,970
Turn the music down one more notch.

1912
01:58:46,970 --> 01:58:47,470
Yes or no.

1913
01:58:50,899 --> 01:58:51,399
What a pull up.

1914
01:58:51,399 --> 01:58:52,199
Well, I forget this up.

1915
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:55,699
Somebody said Popeye is in the, is it in the menu?

1916
01:58:55,699 --> 01:58:56,199
Where is it?

1917
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:08,420
Somebody said it's in the menu.

1918
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:09,319
Where is it?

1919
01:59:12,210 --> 01:59:12,710
No, it's not.

1920
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:13,010
Okay.

1921
01:59:13,010 --> 01:59:22,369
I'm just being lied to being lied to switch to me.

1922
01:59:22,369 --> 01:59:22,569
Cool.

1923
01:59:22,569 --> 01:59:23,569
Let me, I'm going to change character.

1924
01:59:23,569 --> 01:59:23,770
Yeah.

1925
01:59:28,699 --> 01:59:29,600
I'm going to play the other character.

1926
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:33,140
Please.

1927
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:37,449
Uh, I tell, I tell, how do you say it?

1928
01:59:47,979 --> 01:59:48,079
Please.

1929
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:48,779
I'm going to puke.

1930
01:59:51,699 --> 01:59:54,300
You're not going to just drop the volume of the stream a little.

1931
01:59:54,699 --> 01:59:55,000
I'm too.

1932
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,300
I'm at a very good volume.

1933
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:57,500
Yeah.

1934
01:59:57,500 --> 02:00:08,239
You just, please.

1935
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:09,140
I'm going to puke.

1936
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:11,449
I don't think you're good.

1937
02:00:11,449 --> 02:00:12,649
I think you're going to be okay.

1938
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:14,350
Just turn it down.

1939
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:15,750
Why are you blasting it?

1940
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,399
Wonder if it's this one or this one.

1941
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:40,720
314 is a given line, isn't it?

1942
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:41,520
Let's see.

1943
02:00:44,579 --> 02:00:45,680
I think you're right.

1944
02:00:50,979 --> 02:00:56,350
You are correct.

1945
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:56,649
Yes, you are.

1946
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:01,399
I'm not paying attention to the bottom.

1947
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:07,449
Well, I know that's that.

1948
02:01:22,409 --> 02:01:23,010
Bye, Germo.

1949
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:23,609
Bye.

1950
02:01:23,609 --> 02:01:24,109
See you later.

1951
02:01:25,039 --> 02:01:25,439
Thanks for coming.

1952
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:26,239
Hope you had a good Thanksgiving.

1953
02:01:31,319 --> 02:01:31,819
Music down.

1954
02:01:31,819 --> 02:01:32,119
No.

1955
02:01:32,119 --> 02:01:32,420
Okay.

1956
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:42,359
I wonder if I can do the ones.

1957
02:01:49,819 --> 02:01:50,520
Is this the four?

1958
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:52,149
Yes, it is.

1959
02:01:57,409 --> 02:01:59,510
Three, two, three, two.

1960
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:00,210
Cool.

1961
02:02:00,510 --> 02:02:01,409
Two, two.

1962
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:12,520
I think that's going to be it here.

1963
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:12,819
Yeah.

1964
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:24,159
Can you please play the music on your violin?

1965
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:28,399
I owned a violin.

1966
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:37,609
Do you have enough stars to?

1967
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:40,359
You need to talk louder.

1968
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:40,859
No.

1969
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:48,039
I need a new song.

1970
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:50,680
How about this one?

1971
02:02:52,029 --> 02:02:52,329
What?

1972
02:02:52,329 --> 02:02:53,430
How do I not have stars?

1973
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:54,890
I got it.

1974
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:55,090
Okay.

1975
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:56,689
I'm going to bang out some levels really quickly here.

1976
02:03:07,649 --> 02:03:08,250
No more chill.

1977
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:09,149
We want aggressive.

1978
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,399
That's that's just not going to happen right now.

1979
02:03:21,449 --> 02:03:22,149
Let's try this one.

1980
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:41,500
Zero doesn't really matter because I'm going to get all the

1981
02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:41,800
info.

1982
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:42,600
I need her right here.

1983
02:03:52,159 --> 02:03:52,260
Okay.

1984
02:03:52,260 --> 02:03:52,859
Well, that was easy.

1985
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:54,710
What was it?

1986
02:03:55,939 --> 02:03:57,439
One, two, three, four.

1987
02:03:57,539 --> 02:03:58,939
One, two, three, four.

1988
02:04:11,729 --> 02:04:13,229
We can also put our own soundtrack on.

1989
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:17,340
How do you know the four and the and five are on their

1990
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:18,239
respective sides?

1991
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:19,939
That's actually a good question.

1992
02:04:19,939 --> 02:04:20,640
I'm going to answer it.

1993
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:24,539
So on the left-hand side of the screen, say the four, it's

1994
02:04:24,539 --> 02:04:26,039
four space five.

1995
02:04:27,550 --> 02:04:30,649
What that means is the four has to be on the left side.

1996
02:04:30,850 --> 02:04:33,850
They have to be spaced that way.

1997
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:38,949
So if it's four space five, the four has to be first.

1998
02:04:38,949 --> 02:04:40,850
It can't be five and then four.

1999
02:04:41,350 --> 02:04:42,949
It has to you read it left to right.

2000
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:44,250
So left to right.

2001
02:04:44,649 --> 02:04:47,890
You have to put the squares in in sequence.

2002
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:52,739
So see two, one, one.

2003
02:04:52,739 --> 02:04:54,739
It's not just like, oh, two, one, one's going to be randomly

2004
02:04:54,739 --> 02:04:55,239
in here.

2005
02:04:55,939 --> 02:04:59,140
The two has to be first, then a one and then a final one.

2006
02:04:59,239 --> 02:05:00,239
You can see how that looks.

2007
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:00,939
It's two here.

2008
02:05:01,239 --> 02:05:02,140
There's a lot of space.

2009
02:05:02,140 --> 02:05:03,239
The space doesn't matter.

2010
02:05:04,270 --> 02:05:06,670
It could be one space or it could be ten spaces.

2011
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:09,470
It just has to be one square in the middle.

2012
02:05:09,770 --> 02:05:22,739
It has to be kind of stuck.

2013
02:05:24,939 --> 02:05:25,340
No, I'm not.

2014
02:05:29,979 --> 02:05:31,479
One, two, three, four, five.

2015
02:05:33,819 --> 02:05:34,720
All right, reducing.

2016
02:05:40,930 --> 02:05:41,930
Well, I know what that is now.

2017
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:15,340
Deduced.

2018
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:25,319
Still have no idea how this game works.

2019
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:29,500
Well, should we should I explain it?

2020
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:43,369
What are you going to slurp?

2021
02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:47,460
You want me to do my spaghetti?

2022
02:06:47,659 --> 02:06:48,760
You want to have my spaghetti?

2023
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,899
Is somebody coming to say when's the next slurp?

2024
02:06:55,300 --> 02:06:58,840
Is that what you said?

2025
02:07:00,579 --> 02:07:02,380
I need to do one more and I have enough stars.

2026
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:14,970
This is a chunky one.

2027
02:07:15,170 --> 02:07:17,270
Can't say, you know what I mean?

2028
02:07:27,199 --> 02:07:29,199
Can we do a poll for Satori Landy?

2029
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:34,569
I feel like you're just going to say yes to deliberately piss

2030
02:07:34,569 --> 02:07:37,869
off the people that don't want to hear me explain the game

2031
02:07:37,869 --> 02:07:40,270
for like the 12th time in the last two years.

2032
02:07:41,170 --> 02:07:42,869
And you're going to deliberately just try to annoy them

2033
02:07:43,569 --> 02:07:45,069
because I'm going to sit here for five minutes and explain

2034
02:07:45,069 --> 02:07:45,869
the whole game again.

2035
02:07:46,569 --> 02:07:49,369
That's what I know what you're doing because I would vote for

2036
02:07:49,369 --> 02:07:52,970
that if I'm in the chat right now and I'm watching this

2037
02:07:52,970 --> 02:07:53,569
streamer.

2038
02:07:54,439 --> 02:07:56,739
I'm going to be like, yeah, let's get him to explain the

2039
02:07:56,739 --> 02:07:57,140
game.

2040
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:59,439
So all these people get fucking annoyed and leave.

2041
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:04,649
I understand your I understand your comedic effort.

2042
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:05,250
I get it.

2043
02:08:06,289 --> 02:08:07,289
That's why I'm shutting it down.

2044
02:08:35,289 --> 02:08:42,310
Three, four, five, six, three, three, four, five, six.

2045
02:08:42,310 --> 02:08:47,539
Okay, four, three.

2046
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:48,939
Very nice.

2047
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:51,359
Be over here.

2048
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:52,859
Eight complete.

2049
02:08:52,960 --> 02:09:05,449
Three, four, three, two, three.

2050
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:16,460
Is it a heart?

2051
02:09:18,569 --> 02:09:19,869
Playing the game and annoy people.

2052
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:21,770
Well, I just said I wasn't going to do it.

2053
02:09:23,699 --> 02:09:25,699
This vote is a this vote doesn't mean anything to me.

2054
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:33,630
What did you eat today?

2055
02:09:34,229 --> 02:09:40,159
I have one single cup of yogurt and a Sprite.

2056
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:49,119
I had what?

2057
02:09:49,119 --> 02:09:50,819
Somebody said what?

2058
02:09:56,460 --> 02:09:59,260
It's like that is so shocking to hear that.

2059
02:10:00,770 --> 02:10:01,270
What?

2060
02:10:03,239 --> 02:10:04,439
Oh, yeah, guys are cranberries.

2061
02:10:04,439 --> 02:10:06,039
S tier for me mashed potatoes.

2062
02:10:06,039 --> 02:10:06,239
Great.

2063
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:06,739
Oh man.

2064
02:10:06,739 --> 02:10:09,539
Oh, you know, God, we got this little butterball turkey.

2065
02:10:09,539 --> 02:10:10,640
Oh, it's so good.

2066
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:11,239
What do you do?

2067
02:10:11,239 --> 02:10:12,739
Well, I had to go yogurt today.

2068
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:13,239
That's it.

2069
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:18,369
Nice spaghetti.

2070
02:10:18,369 --> 02:10:18,970
Liar.

2071
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:28,020
Shit.

2072
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:30,020
Do I only get one star for these?

2073
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:32,420
But I was getting less stars.

2074
02:10:37,590 --> 02:10:39,390
Oh, clear the puzzle.

2075
02:10:39,390 --> 02:10:40,390
No misses.

2076
02:10:40,390 --> 02:10:41,189
No hints.

2077
02:10:41,489 --> 02:10:42,289
I'm getting two.

2078
02:10:42,689 --> 02:10:43,590
I could get up to three.

2079
02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:45,600
All right.

2080
02:10:45,699 --> 02:10:50,819
I got to get why lie viewers when you're eating spaghetti.

2081
02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:57,449
Because there's no actually spaghetti over here.

2082
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:01,720
I think I can get this whole thing one.

2083
02:11:02,619 --> 02:11:04,020
So let me mark it.

2084
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:10,279
It's one one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five.

2085
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:10,579
Nope.

2086
02:11:30,970 --> 02:11:31,170
All right.

2087
02:11:31,170 --> 02:11:32,069
It's getting a little weird here.

2088
02:11:32,069 --> 02:11:32,670
One.

2089
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:37,300
We did that seven now.

2090
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:41,680
Reset it.

2091
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:42,779
I don't care.

2092
02:11:42,779 --> 02:11:43,180
Reset.

2093
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:48,260
I didn't mean to go that far.

2094
02:11:51,399 --> 02:11:53,100
Why would you lie about having spaghetti?

2095
02:11:54,010 --> 02:11:55,310
I don't know because I thought it was funny.

2096
02:11:55,710 --> 02:12:17,409
You're a cheater.

2097
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:18,979
I'm not cheating.

2098
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:26,000
Oh, that's a big raid.

2099
02:12:27,159 --> 02:12:29,359
Box box coming in with a monster raid.

2100
02:12:31,010 --> 02:12:31,609
What's going on?

2101
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:34,020
Thanks for the raid box box.

2102
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:34,619
Hope you're doing well.

2103
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:37,560
Hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving coming over.

2104
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:38,659
Celebrate it.

2105
02:12:38,859 --> 02:12:39,859
You as well box box.

2106
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:41,859
Welcome.

2107
02:12:41,859 --> 02:12:42,560
We're playing pit cross.

2108
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:46,359
We're just doing a chill night stream for two, three hours.

2109
02:12:46,359 --> 02:12:48,220
So hanging out.

2110
02:12:49,539 --> 02:12:49,939
Welcome.

2111
02:12:50,039 --> 02:12:50,539
Thanks a lot.

2112
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:56,829
We're discussing our favorite Thanksgiving dinner items.

2113
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:02,659
And what I said, I said that my favorite Thanksgiving item was

2114
02:13:02,659 --> 02:13:07,960
cranberry sauce in the can that you have to actually get like

2115
02:13:09,439 --> 02:13:11,539
and it splies out and hits the thing.

2116
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,579
People thought that it was kind of weird, but that is one of

2117
02:13:16,579 --> 02:13:17,380
my favorite items.

2118
02:13:21,130 --> 02:13:21,630
But yeah, welcome.

2119
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:23,130
Hope you had a good holiday.

2120
02:13:23,529 --> 02:13:24,430
Again, if you celebrate it.

2121
02:13:31,829 --> 02:13:32,829
I think I can do this.

2122
02:13:33,229 --> 02:13:34,239
It's one.

2123
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:38,500
Oh, by the way, box box.

2124
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:38,800
You got it.

2125
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:39,600
You got to check out.

2126
02:13:39,699 --> 02:13:40,699
You got to check out pit cross.

2127
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:41,399
All right.

2128
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:49,289
It's like one of the most fun games ever cranberry sauce is

2129
02:13:49,289 --> 02:13:49,789
underrated.

2130
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:53,640
He was eating yogurt spaghetti.

2131
02:13:53,739 --> 02:13:54,340
Don't lie.

2132
02:13:56,090 --> 02:13:56,590
Can I do this?

2133
02:13:56,590 --> 02:13:56,789
Let's see.

2134
02:13:56,789 --> 02:13:58,689
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2135
02:13:59,189 --> 02:14:01,380
Yeah, that's the whole line.

2136
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:03,420
Now the whole thing opens up.

2137
02:14:04,460 --> 02:14:04,859
Oh, yeah.

2138
02:14:12,189 --> 02:14:12,590
Mm-hmm.

2139
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:14,619
Mm-hmm.

2140
02:14:15,649 --> 02:14:16,149
Mm-hmm.

2141
02:14:17,710 --> 02:14:18,109
Mm-hmm.

2142
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:19,189
Mm-hmm.

2143
02:14:21,260 --> 02:14:21,659
Mm-hmm.

2144
02:14:23,300 --> 02:14:23,699
Mm-hmm.

2145
02:14:26,489 --> 02:14:26,890
Mm-hmm.

2146
02:14:28,390 --> 02:14:28,689
Mm-hmm.

2147
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,000
Mm-hmm.

2148
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:37,869
Mm-hmm.

2149
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:38,670
Mm-hmm.

2150
02:14:40,270 --> 02:14:40,670
I did it.

2151
02:14:43,579 --> 02:14:44,180
Satellite.

2152
02:14:45,579 --> 02:14:45,979
All right.

2153
02:14:47,279 --> 02:14:50,079
This is Miku pick Ross, which what that means is this is a

2154
02:14:50,479 --> 02:14:54,180
you've unlocked pictures and music from Miku.

2155
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:56,680
If you're a Miku fan, I'm just a pick Ross fan.

2156
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:04,060
I mean, I mean, it doesn't doesn't like Miku, right?

2157
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:09,159
All right.

2158
02:15:09,159 --> 02:15:09,460
I thank you.

2159
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:10,760
Do I have enough for another song?

2160
02:15:14,779 --> 02:15:14,979
All right.

2161
02:15:14,979 --> 02:15:15,979
I need one more level and I got it.

2162
02:15:25,229 --> 02:15:25,930
Dude, it's annoying.

2163
02:15:25,930 --> 02:15:39,560
All you do is eat spaghetti and lie a weird trait to have.

2164
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:46,699
I don't know.

2165
02:15:46,699 --> 02:15:49,500
I feel like that's I don't know for some reason.

2166
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:51,899
I feel like that's like a like a relationship thing.

2167
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:54,600
Like you like we're like breaking up.

2168
02:15:56,500 --> 02:16:04,520
All you do is eat spaghetti and lie like what the fuck I feel

2169
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:06,220
like what what is what is this?

2170
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:28,979
This is part of the I don't want to go that actually I can

2171
02:16:28,979 --> 02:16:29,880
because it's a two there.

2172
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:38,139
I might be going a little quick some people saying hey,

2173
02:16:38,139 --> 02:16:38,940
he's going really fast.

2174
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:39,739
It's hard to keep up.

2175
02:16:41,809 --> 02:16:43,809
You you'll start to pick it up.

2176
02:16:44,389 --> 02:16:45,290
Once you get it, you get it.

2177
02:16:49,139 --> 02:16:49,739
There's only okay.

2178
02:16:49,739 --> 02:16:52,239
This is like a actual two out of three chance that I get this

2179
02:16:52,239 --> 02:16:52,840
right over here.

2180
02:16:56,659 --> 02:16:58,459
There's a 50-50 chance that it's either here or here.

2181
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:02,739
I'm going to flip the coin heads.

2182
02:17:27,899 --> 02:17:28,299
It's okay.

2183
02:17:33,219 --> 02:17:34,420
Just don't make another mistake.

2184
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:38,920
I need the stars.

2185
02:17:50,389 --> 02:17:51,489
So then it has to be down here.

2186
02:17:52,329 --> 02:18:00,090
I've reduced it to three, four, five, six, one, two, three,

2187
02:18:00,090 --> 02:18:00,989
four, five, six.

2188
02:18:07,540 --> 02:18:24,469
I can get this latest high.

2189
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:36,049
I mean, yeah, I feel like it would be very difficult.

2190
02:18:36,149 --> 02:18:49,610
It's a five one.

2191
02:18:56,450 --> 02:18:57,149
This seven's done.

2192
02:18:57,149 --> 02:18:57,850
So it has to be here.

2193
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,000
Very nice.

2194
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:02,100
Very nice.

2195
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:03,370
Very nice.

2196
02:19:04,010 --> 02:19:04,409
Wow.

2197
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:06,420
Build it all in in one second.

2198
02:19:07,379 --> 02:19:08,680
You like it would be annoying high.

2199
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:20,549
Yeah, but I would rather here's another thing too.

2200
02:19:20,649 --> 02:19:21,149
I made this.

2201
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:22,149
I've talked about this before.

2202
02:19:23,350 --> 02:19:25,750
I don't want like, you know, doing drugs to be something

2203
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:27,649
that's like, oh, I'm going to do that in stream.

2204
02:19:27,649 --> 02:19:28,350
Like isn't that funny?

2205
02:19:28,350 --> 02:19:29,049
Isn't that cool?

2206
02:19:30,149 --> 02:19:32,250
No, I thought about like stuff like that before, but it's

2207
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:33,850
just I'd rather not.

2208
02:19:34,450 --> 02:19:35,350
I'm completely honest.

2209
02:19:38,139 --> 02:19:39,940
That's not to say like, oh, it would be like maybe be kind

2210
02:19:39,940 --> 02:19:40,340
of fun.

2211
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:42,700
I just don't want I don't know.

2212
02:19:42,979 --> 02:19:45,180
I feel like I'd rather just not do that.

2213
02:19:56,299 --> 02:19:56,799
Liar.

2214
02:19:59,170 --> 02:20:00,670
You talk about it like every stream.

2215
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,500
I definitely do not.

2216
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:05,000
That is it.

2217
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:14,940
That isn't an embellishment and don't get me wrong.

2218
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:19,389
Like recreational marijuana, if it's legal where you are

2219
02:20:19,389 --> 02:20:22,290
and you, you know, safely doing it and you know, privacy

2220
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:24,889
of your own home or among, you know, friends in a place

2221
02:20:24,889 --> 02:20:28,790
where it's safe and you're going to be, you know, safe

2222
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:31,850
about it by all means, right?

2223
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:35,520
But I don't know if I want to make it like content piece.

2224
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:46,409
I think that's going another step forward because I mean,

2225
02:20:46,709 --> 02:20:51,750
so I mean, we all know that the famous clock fiasco, right?

2226
02:20:51,750 --> 02:20:57,770
The big clock scandal where I had been, you know, doing

2227
02:20:57,770 --> 02:21:00,670
marijuana because well, one of the main reasons why I

2228
02:21:00,670 --> 02:21:04,170
started taking in any amount of THC in the first place

2229
02:21:04,170 --> 02:21:05,469
was because the pain problem that I have.

2230
02:21:06,270 --> 02:21:09,840
So I wasn't like I was I mean, I didn't start really.

2231
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:12,639
Oh, I'm going to just get high every single day.

2232
02:21:12,639 --> 02:21:14,540
That wasn't any ever what I want to do and that's not

2233
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:15,239
what I do either.

2234
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:21,319
But that like you can't I just can't do that anymore.

2235
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:27,500
It was very clear that I can't read a clock and people

2236
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:32,239
are going to know there's no way people are going to I'm

2237
02:21:32,239 --> 02:21:34,989
going to be able to hide that like I take a little bit

2238
02:21:34,989 --> 02:21:37,790
of THC and like relax and stream and I can't read an

2239
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:39,489
analog clock and people go what time is it?

2240
02:21:39,489 --> 02:21:42,340
I'm like, I don't I don't know.

2241
02:21:42,739 --> 02:21:43,340
Like, what do you mean?

2242
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:43,940
You don't know.

2243
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:45,639
How is it possible?

2244
02:21:46,709 --> 02:21:48,610
How is it possible that you don't know that?

2245
02:21:50,530 --> 02:21:52,329
It's like, I don't know and then it's embarrassing

2246
02:21:52,329 --> 02:21:56,100
because I can't you said you lied lied about what being

2247
02:21:56,200 --> 02:21:57,100
high that day.

2248
02:22:01,579 --> 02:22:06,540
Did I say that was I actually high that day?

2249
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:08,840
I thought I was I don't remember.

2250
02:22:13,139 --> 02:22:14,139
Did I make that up?

2251
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:15,840
No, I don't think so.

2252
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:17,440
Maybe I told you I made it up.

2253
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:19,040
So you didn't think I was a moron.

2254
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:20,559
I don't know.

2255
02:22:20,559 --> 02:22:21,659
There's something else going on there.

2256
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:23,459
He's high right now.

2257
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:34,719
He has dementia find the clip of me talking about it.

2258
02:22:34,719 --> 02:22:35,620
I'm actually curious.

2259
02:22:38,959 --> 02:22:40,959
I forget what the lie was.

2260
02:22:43,659 --> 02:22:48,170
What did um, there's a famous famous person.

2261
02:22:48,170 --> 02:22:48,870
What do they say?

2262
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:52,370
They said as long as you have it's like tell the truth

2263
02:22:52,370 --> 02:22:55,659
always so you never have to remember anything who said

2264
02:22:55,659 --> 02:23:01,319
that like Mark Twain or something is like always tell

2265
02:23:01,319 --> 02:23:01,719
the truth.

2266
02:23:01,719 --> 02:23:06,409
So you never have to remember anything not Winston

2267
02:23:06,409 --> 02:23:06,709
Churchill.

2268
02:23:06,709 --> 02:23:15,229
I think it was Mark Twain Lady Gaga.

2269
02:23:15,229 --> 02:23:16,629
No, I think it was Mark Twain.

2270
02:23:22,590 --> 02:23:26,620
Fuck how deep does that lie go?

2271
02:23:26,620 --> 02:23:30,319
I wonder here's another problem.

2272
02:23:31,100 --> 02:23:32,700
I have real I have like kind of bad memory problems

2273
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:33,200
anyways.

2274
02:23:33,899 --> 02:23:36,200
So I actually don't even remember if I was come on.

2275
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:37,899
I don't remember if I was just fucking around or not.

2276
02:23:38,299 --> 02:23:40,000
Like when I said that that time that I told you I was

2277
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:40,700
lying about it.

2278
02:23:40,799 --> 02:23:41,799
I might have just making it up.

2279
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:43,000
I don't remember.

2280
02:23:43,799 --> 02:23:47,700
I actually don't remember it was Peewee Herman.

2281
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:53,729
Is it this is just what this is a clip.

2282
02:23:53,729 --> 02:23:54,430
Why are you clipping this?

2283
02:23:55,270 --> 02:23:59,370
The left and right are numbers which indicate how many

2284
02:23:59,370 --> 02:24:02,069
cubes need to be filled in in that row or column for

2285
02:24:02,069 --> 02:24:05,069
instance, there has to be why did you just link this

2286
02:24:05,069 --> 02:24:05,370
to me?

2287
02:24:06,370 --> 02:24:07,969
This is just me explaining the game.

2288
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:23,979
I think you said you were not I then later came clean

2289
02:24:23,979 --> 02:24:27,889
that you were I can't keep track of what the fuck

2290
02:24:27,889 --> 02:24:40,139
this guy ever says you lied about being high in the

2291
02:24:40,139 --> 02:24:41,739
concrete level not the clock.

2292
02:24:41,739 --> 02:24:42,940
I think that's correct.

2293
02:24:44,129 --> 02:24:45,129
That's what it was.

2294
02:24:45,129 --> 02:24:45,729
That's what it was.

2295
02:24:45,729 --> 02:24:46,030
Yep.

2296
02:24:46,329 --> 02:24:47,530
I think we're mixing it up a little bit.

2297
02:24:47,530 --> 02:24:49,030
So let me let me clear the air.

2298
02:24:49,030 --> 02:24:50,829
Let me get a clear picture of what happened.

2299
02:24:51,530 --> 02:24:55,829
So during the hitman 3 streams, I was walking around

2300
02:24:55,829 --> 02:24:57,530
on one of the levels where it's like I think it's

2301
02:24:57,530 --> 02:24:58,629
like the club or something, right?

2302
02:24:58,729 --> 02:25:01,530
It's a big concrete level and I did not know where

2303
02:25:01,530 --> 02:25:04,430
I was going and it was so frustrating and I was

2304
02:25:04,430 --> 02:25:07,629
getting so pissed off and so agitated by it and I

2305
02:25:07,629 --> 02:25:09,430
look I remember looking over at the chat and being

2306
02:25:09,430 --> 02:25:13,360
like people were saying this can't be for real.

2307
02:25:13,559 --> 02:25:15,059
He has to be under the influence.

2308
02:25:15,059 --> 02:25:16,659
There's no way a person could be like this.

2309
02:25:16,659 --> 02:25:17,760
I'm concerned about him.

2310
02:25:18,559 --> 02:25:20,559
I remember reading people saying I'm concerned

2311
02:25:20,559 --> 02:25:21,059
about this.

2312
02:25:21,559 --> 02:25:26,930
I'm very concerned about him and I was like fuck

2313
02:25:27,129 --> 02:25:28,430
I can't be this stupid.

2314
02:25:29,129 --> 02:25:30,829
I was like, oh, I guess the yeah, I guess the

2315
02:25:30,829 --> 02:25:32,329
edible started kicking in.

2316
02:25:32,329 --> 02:25:32,629
Yeah.

2317
02:25:32,629 --> 02:25:33,629
I remember I lied about that.

2318
02:25:33,629 --> 02:25:33,829
Yep.

2319
02:25:33,829 --> 02:25:34,430
Oh hundred percent.

2320
02:25:36,979 --> 02:25:37,579
That's what it was.

2321
02:25:40,670 --> 02:25:43,069
So I made it up that I oh, yeah guys.

2322
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:45,069
I took a little bit before the stream.

2323
02:25:45,069 --> 02:25:48,469
It's like kicking in and everyone's like, oh, okay.

2324
02:25:48,469 --> 02:25:49,370
All right.

2325
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:50,569
Now it makes sense.

2326
02:25:50,770 --> 02:25:52,370
All right, dude, do you you're good.

2327
02:25:52,770 --> 02:25:54,569
I'm sitting there going like fucking thank God

2328
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:00,389
clock one was real.

2329
02:26:00,489 --> 02:26:05,430
It was I actually remember people writing in the

2330
02:26:05,430 --> 02:26:05,729
chat.

2331
02:26:05,729 --> 02:26:09,799
It was so just like man, I he's not pretending and

2332
02:26:09,799 --> 02:26:10,700
it's not even funny.

2333
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:12,200
It's just like concerning that he doesn't know

2334
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:12,799
where he is.

2335
02:26:18,540 --> 02:26:20,239
That's so funny in a way though.

2336
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:24,899
I made up that I was high to make so you didn't

2337
02:26:24,899 --> 02:26:29,200
think I was like having like some type of problem.

2338
02:26:30,459 --> 02:26:32,360
Like I didn't want to never think I was stupid.

2339
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:38,139
Yeah.

2340
02:26:38,139 --> 02:26:40,840
And then all right restart and then I can't I

2341
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:43,440
came out later like months later.

2342
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:43,940
That was like guys.

2343
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:44,840
I made that up, right?

2344
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:45,040
Okay.

2345
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:47,340
So we are we're I we clear the air on this.

2346
02:26:59,250 --> 02:27:01,250
I gotta be careful because whoa, stop doing that.

2347
02:27:01,250 --> 02:27:02,250
I don't these are not guarantees.

2348
02:27:02,250 --> 02:27:03,149
This is a guarantee.

2349
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:03,850
No, it's not.

2350
02:27:04,729 --> 02:27:05,629
How did I just get that?

2351
02:27:12,930 --> 02:27:14,430
Are there any lies you told on stream you haven't

2352
02:27:14,430 --> 02:27:15,229
come clean about?

2353
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:18,819
I I don't I don't think so.

2354
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:23,469
I mean, I kind of just I mess around a lot like

2355
02:27:23,469 --> 02:27:24,270
we all do here.

2356
02:27:26,040 --> 02:27:27,340
I mean this this plenty of opportunities where I

2357
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:30,340
just kind of say just stuff just to make up a

2358
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:31,440
scenario for fun.

2359
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:32,340
Fuck.

2360
02:27:32,739 --> 02:27:34,139
No, I'm not going back.

2361
02:27:40,329 --> 02:27:41,829
I think it's clear when I do that though.

2362
02:27:42,469 --> 02:27:44,940
I think it's pretty set in stone that that's me

2363
02:27:44,940 --> 02:27:57,459
just messing around spaghetti and meatballs.

2364
02:27:57,659 --> 02:27:57,860
Yeah.

2365
02:27:57,860 --> 02:27:59,959
I mean, but did you honestly believe that was

2366
02:27:59,959 --> 02:28:00,360
real?

2367
02:28:02,889 --> 02:28:03,290
Come on.

2368
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:25,770
When yes, it's like almost the whole screen

2369
02:28:25,770 --> 02:28:26,270
filled in.

2370
02:28:30,340 --> 02:28:34,489
What is this a chair?

2371
02:28:43,530 --> 02:28:44,629
Why would you lie about it?

2372
02:28:47,649 --> 02:28:51,120
No, because it's fun just to like make up fun

2373
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:53,420
scenarios that just I don't know why why not?

2374
02:28:53,420 --> 02:28:54,020
It's fun.

2375
02:28:58,329 --> 02:28:59,229
Oh, I didn't even click on it.

2376
02:29:14,469 --> 02:29:15,370
Let you in here.

2377
02:29:16,559 --> 02:29:19,520
I did by the first song.

2378
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:20,120
I've seen that a lot.

2379
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:20,620
I'll do that.

2380
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:30,090
What is the first song?

2381
02:29:36,139 --> 02:29:37,239
Which one of these is the first song?

2382
02:29:44,670 --> 02:29:47,770
Hey guys, did you know spaghetti and meatballs?

2383
02:29:50,229 --> 02:29:51,930
But you forgot about the laugh track right after

2384
02:29:51,930 --> 02:29:52,229
that.

2385
02:29:56,899 --> 02:29:58,200
That's just kind of funny what you said.

2386
02:29:58,799 --> 02:29:59,100
All right.

2387
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:00,100
Where's the first song?

2388
02:30:08,709 --> 02:30:09,409
How was your Thanksgiving?

2389
02:30:09,409 --> 02:30:09,909
It was great.

2390
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:27,670
That guy spammed spaghetti and meatballs dozens

2391
02:30:27,670 --> 02:30:28,370
of times.

2392
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:37,430
No, did I just catch the spammer and I thought

2393
02:30:37,430 --> 02:30:38,829
it was with the way I said it about you?

2394
02:30:38,829 --> 02:30:39,329
Whatever.

2395
02:30:39,629 --> 02:30:39,930
All right.

2396
02:30:39,930 --> 02:30:41,530
What's the name of the song that you want me

2397
02:30:41,530 --> 02:30:42,129
to unlock?

2398
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:51,459
I don't was it this one?

2399
02:30:57,420 --> 02:30:57,819
That's hard.

2400
02:30:57,819 --> 02:31:04,500
I can't it's hard for me to translate that which

2401
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:10,549
one the one you were on the previous one the

2402
02:31:10,549 --> 02:31:17,860
previous one this one.

2403
02:31:26,850 --> 02:31:58,319
I'm trying to I can't read it this one chat

2404
02:31:58,319 --> 02:31:59,120
read it wrong.

2405
02:32:01,209 --> 02:32:03,540
I'll put it on and blast it.

2406
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:05,139
Well, I'm not going to blast it, but I'll play

2407
02:32:05,139 --> 02:32:05,440
it.

2408
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:15,569
Is it instrumental?

2409
02:32:15,569 --> 02:32:17,170
No, it's just one of the one I bought has

2410
02:32:17,170 --> 02:32:17,770
vocals, right?

2411
02:32:29,979 --> 02:32:30,680
Please don't blast it.

2412
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:31,180
I have a headache.

2413
02:32:31,180 --> 02:32:35,379
No, I'm not gonna see how it is.

2414
02:32:51,649 --> 02:32:53,149
I think that's all I can do down here now.

2415
02:32:56,709 --> 02:32:57,809
So I can do this.

2416
02:32:59,590 --> 02:33:00,389
There we go.

2417
02:33:06,729 --> 02:33:22,360
This one this one's got this was this one's

2418
02:33:44,430 --> 02:33:45,229
top rows again.

2419
02:33:48,020 --> 02:33:55,719
You're up to one.

2420
02:33:56,219 --> 02:33:57,420
One down here is a two somewhere.

2421
02:34:13,750 --> 02:34:13,950
All right.

2422
02:34:13,950 --> 02:34:15,750
Hold on to do.

2423
02:34:17,350 --> 02:34:18,549
That's a one.

2424
02:34:18,549 --> 02:34:26,020
Okay, he's actually pretty good at Picross.

2425
02:34:27,479 --> 02:34:30,479
Oh when I'm just when I focus I've been playing

2426
02:34:30,479 --> 02:34:32,579
Picross for years for 10 years.

2427
02:34:33,579 --> 02:34:35,180
I remember the first Picross game that I ever

2428
02:34:35,180 --> 02:34:39,450
played I think was on the original DS the original

2429
02:34:39,450 --> 02:34:40,149
Nintendo DS.

2430
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:42,799
So it's fun.

2431
02:34:45,770 --> 02:34:46,170
Now.

2432
02:34:46,170 --> 02:34:46,670
All right.

2433
02:34:46,770 --> 02:34:49,670
This is very beginner to intermediate stuff.

2434
02:34:50,969 --> 02:34:54,969
There's once you get into the 20 by 20 like 50

2435
02:34:54,969 --> 02:34:57,670
by 50 it gets really you have to pay a lot

2436
02:34:57,670 --> 02:34:58,969
attention to everything going on.

2437
02:35:00,069 --> 02:35:02,469
I don't know why my voice just did that but my

2438
02:35:02,469 --> 02:35:03,870
eyes were very confused by it.

2439
02:35:07,049 --> 02:35:08,049
Yeah, see 10 by 10.

2440
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:09,790
This is all 10 by 10.

2441
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:15,049
Then when I go over here 20 by 20, this is

2442
02:35:15,049 --> 02:35:19,610
obviously level 3 20 by 20 is pretty I'd say 15

2443
02:35:19,610 --> 02:35:22,680
by 15 is pretty standard 20 by 20 gets pretty

2444
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:22,979
hard.

2445
02:35:24,260 --> 02:35:25,260
You were 20 by 20.

2446
02:35:26,299 --> 02:35:27,899
I'll I'll try 20 by 20.

2447
02:35:28,510 --> 02:35:31,340
Let's see if I can handle it and see everything

2448
02:35:31,340 --> 02:35:31,639
right.

2449
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:32,719
All right.

2450
02:35:32,719 --> 02:35:34,219
So this is 20 by 20.

2451
02:35:34,219 --> 02:35:38,920
So therefore 15 16 17 18 so if teens that means

2452
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:40,219
five has to be on each side.

2453
02:35:45,889 --> 02:35:48,790
There's this they get they get pretty wacky and

2454
02:35:48,790 --> 02:35:50,790
I tried 17 18.

2455
02:35:57,870 --> 02:36:02,870
Let me think if there's a 10 50 by 20 that means

2456
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:16,600
that as long as there is and see can't do anything

2457
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:18,500
in the middle really because there's no way to

2458
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:19,600
know where it sits.

2459
02:36:27,010 --> 02:36:28,309
Really there's more I could get from here.

2460
02:36:29,889 --> 02:36:34,190
Can I let me tell you what 1 2 3 13 14 15 16

2461
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:35,790
17 18 this 20 here.

2462
02:36:35,790 --> 02:36:43,219
1 2 3 4 5 15 16 17 18 9 is 19.

2463
02:36:44,420 --> 02:36:45,319
I think I got it though.

2464
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:46,920
That's one.

2465
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:49,520
There's only one slot that's not filled in here

2466
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:50,620
and I don't know where it could be.

2467
02:36:58,459 --> 02:36:59,360
Let's be two in the middle.

2468
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:08,600
1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I don't

2469
02:37:08,600 --> 02:37:12,370
think I can reliably fill these in but I guess

2470
02:37:12,370 --> 02:37:19,069
so because that means 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 they both

2471
02:37:19,069 --> 02:37:19,770
could do that.

2472
02:37:19,870 --> 02:37:21,770
Although this is not something you would actually

2473
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:22,069
know.

2474
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:29,379
Are there any 20s like a whole row?

2475
02:37:29,479 --> 02:37:29,879
I need us.

2476
02:37:29,979 --> 02:37:35,629
I need an edge for 15.

2477
02:37:35,629 --> 02:37:37,430
I need an edge at least some kind of edge to

2478
02:37:37,430 --> 02:37:42,700
start yet.

2479
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:57,040
Sorry restart part of the 10 this is part of the

2480
02:37:57,040 --> 02:37:57,540
9.

2481
02:38:04,020 --> 02:38:06,020
We said I just did the exact same thing.

2482
02:38:07,510 --> 02:38:19,520
Fill in the 7 10 3 4 5 6 7 space 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

2483
02:38:21,450 --> 02:38:26,760
I mean it could be so what like two out from each

2484
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:27,159
side.

2485
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:31,440
I don't know where the space though is but it has

2486
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:34,639
to be like this and it has to be at least these

2487
02:38:34,639 --> 02:38:37,639
ones up here because I don't know where the space

2488
02:38:37,639 --> 02:38:37,940
is.

2489
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:40,540
I am so annoyed whatever I'm going to leave it

2490
02:38:42,510 --> 02:38:43,909
because I don't know where the space is going to

2491
02:38:43,909 --> 02:38:46,309
be because it could be whatever I got it.

2492
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:51,379
That's enough info to help you to have an oatmeal

2493
02:38:51,379 --> 02:38:51,579
brain.

2494
02:38:51,579 --> 02:38:54,360
I can't actually that's a lot of info though.

2495
02:39:06,659 --> 02:39:07,360
This is a good start.

2496
02:39:13,790 --> 02:39:14,290
Perfect.

2497
02:39:14,790 --> 02:39:15,489
Now.

2498
02:39:15,489 --> 02:39:16,889
I don't know anything about that.

2499
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:40,420
Okay, what about the top row 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10?

2500
02:39:44,729 --> 02:39:48,329
Although I can fill in some of this though because

2501
02:39:48,329 --> 02:39:50,229
it's definitely in this row here.

2502
02:39:50,229 --> 02:39:51,530
I just don't know if it's this way.

2503
02:39:53,059 --> 02:39:53,959
It's definitely here.

2504
02:39:57,049 --> 02:39:58,549
That means the two has to be here then.

2505
02:39:58,649 --> 02:39:58,950
Yeah.

2506
02:39:59,149 --> 02:40:00,450
What do you mean the two is not there?

2507
02:40:00,450 --> 02:40:01,549
How is that possible?

2508
02:40:01,549 --> 02:40:01,950
What?

2509
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:05,979
Oh shit.

2510
02:40:07,479 --> 02:40:09,680
When they get big like this, it's all right.

2511
02:40:10,180 --> 02:40:11,180
I just can't get three strikes.

2512
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:31,239
I mean it has to be at least one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

2513
02:40:36,340 --> 02:40:37,139
Any more info?

2514
02:40:40,260 --> 02:40:59,190
Good 10 9 and 1.

2515
02:41:00,469 --> 02:41:02,270
Okay, this is part of a 2.

2516
02:41:06,239 --> 02:41:07,239
Well, here's the 12.

2517
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:08,239
Can I do anything with 12?

2518
02:41:08,739 --> 02:41:13,110
Say 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.

2519
02:41:16,549 --> 02:41:20,750
Before 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.

2520
02:41:20,750 --> 02:41:22,350
Okay, so it has to be like this.

2521
02:41:24,969 --> 02:41:25,670
One more, right?

2522
02:41:32,680 --> 02:41:33,780
Why are we yelling at each other?

2523
02:41:35,989 --> 02:41:37,590
Why are people screaming at each other?

2524
02:41:40,229 --> 02:41:41,729
Turn off the music.

2525
02:41:44,620 --> 02:41:47,219
I have to admit it has been a little distracting.

2526
02:41:48,129 --> 02:41:51,030
So if it's a little distracting for me, the person streaming,

2527
02:41:51,829 --> 02:41:55,030
then some of you guys must must be unbearable for some of you.

2528
02:41:59,430 --> 02:42:00,829
I can't turn it off from here.

2529
02:42:02,629 --> 02:42:03,430
I don't want to give up.

2530
02:42:14,579 --> 02:42:15,079
Turn it up.

2531
02:42:15,180 --> 02:42:16,379
No, I'm not going to turn it up.

2532
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:21,040
I'm getting closer.

2533
02:42:21,139 --> 02:42:22,440
So not much longer.

2534
02:42:44,420 --> 02:42:46,520
I love Miku.

2535
02:42:46,819 --> 02:42:47,920
I do Miku's great.

2536
02:42:48,319 --> 02:42:51,020
But I think we're going to put on a different song.

2537
02:42:52,079 --> 02:42:53,079
Can we streamer's choice?

2538
02:43:21,469 --> 02:43:23,569
I don't know why I wanted to listen to this for one second.

2539
02:43:23,569 --> 02:43:25,670
This is worse because it's probably really copywritten.

2540
02:43:31,690 --> 02:43:32,290
That's not the one.

2541
02:43:32,389 --> 02:43:32,889
Never mind.

2542
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:46,360
Where's Miku?

2543
02:43:50,629 --> 02:43:51,530
Austin Powers.

2544
02:43:51,629 --> 02:43:52,530
We did that already.

2545
02:44:01,899 --> 02:44:04,000
Oh, I could just play Miku songs that I like.

2546
02:44:06,370 --> 02:44:06,870
Holy shit.

2547
02:44:06,870 --> 02:44:07,969
That's actually true.

2548
02:44:27,540 --> 02:44:31,790
Okay, is this the right version?

2549
02:44:31,790 --> 02:44:32,790
Is there more than one version?

2550
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:42,239
I guess it was the one.

2551
02:44:44,090 --> 02:44:45,790
Probably here, but I'm afraid to get three strikes.

2552
02:45:09,479 --> 02:45:09,979
Nice.

2553
02:45:12,350 --> 02:45:13,750
That was risky, but it was worth it.

2554
02:45:20,079 --> 02:45:24,360
2 3 4 5 6 7.

2555
02:45:25,190 --> 02:45:26,090
Part of the 10.

2556
02:45:26,290 --> 02:45:41,959
You need to sing it.

2557
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:53,940
All right, this is 11.

2558
02:45:55,309 --> 02:45:55,510
All right.

2559
02:45:55,510 --> 02:45:56,110
So that was fun.

2560
02:45:59,250 --> 02:45:59,850
What else should I do?

2561
02:46:04,020 --> 02:46:05,819
Are both songs playing right now?

2562
02:46:06,219 --> 02:46:06,620
I don't think so.

2563
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:06,920
I turned it.

2564
02:46:06,920 --> 02:46:07,120
I should.

2565
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:07,620
I turned it on.

2566
02:46:19,780 --> 02:46:23,479
People saying play triple, triple baka, triple baka.

2567
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:25,409
Okay.

2568
02:46:33,250 --> 02:46:33,649
Yes.

2569
02:46:33,649 --> 02:46:34,049
Yes.

2570
02:46:34,049 --> 02:46:34,649
Yes.

2571
02:46:34,649 --> 02:46:35,450
Have I ever heard this?

2572
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:58,620
Seven.

2573
02:47:02,360 --> 02:47:03,159
Where's the two go?

2574
02:47:03,360 --> 02:47:04,059
Okay, this one a half.

2575
02:47:04,159 --> 02:47:05,659
This is one, two.

2576
02:47:07,260 --> 02:47:08,059
Oh, it has to be this way.

2577
02:47:09,260 --> 02:47:17,469
All these need to be filled in.

2578
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:20,739
Is the, yeah, this is nine.

2579
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:22,540
This is no, this is not five.

2580
02:47:22,540 --> 02:47:22,739
Right?

2581
02:47:22,739 --> 02:47:29,659
One, eight, nine, one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three,

2582
02:47:29,659 --> 02:47:38,479
four, five, people, people, people, people, people.

2583
02:47:43,780 --> 02:48:00,299
That's this is definitely part of the seven.

2584
02:48:11,719 --> 02:48:12,020
Right?

2585
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:12,319
Yeah.

2586
02:48:13,620 --> 02:48:29,510
Well, I would imagine this is probably the four, but I can't deduce

2587
02:48:29,510 --> 02:48:30,610
that, but I'm going to go for it.

2588
02:49:05,409 --> 02:49:06,110
It's three strikes.

2589
02:49:16,909 --> 02:49:21,760
I got too comfortable that I'm going to finish it.

2590
02:49:21,860 --> 02:49:22,360
I'll finish it.

2591
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:22,860
I'll finish it.

2592
02:49:24,440 --> 02:49:24,840
Shit.

2593
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:26,040
I'm not going to get any points with this.

2594
02:49:40,170 --> 02:49:42,870
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2595
02:49:43,569 --> 02:49:46,270
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2596
02:49:53,209 --> 02:49:54,309
Still don't know what side it's on.

2597
02:49:55,309 --> 02:49:55,709
Do I?

2598
02:49:56,809 --> 02:49:57,510
I do.

2599
02:50:01,879 --> 02:50:02,780
What happened?

2600
02:50:03,079 --> 02:50:03,579
What'd I do?

2601
02:50:03,579 --> 02:50:04,079
What happened?

2602
02:50:04,180 --> 02:50:04,879
What'd I do wrong?

2603
02:50:07,069 --> 02:50:07,770
Where's the one?

2604
02:50:08,270 --> 02:50:08,569
What?

2605
02:50:08,569 --> 02:50:09,069
Hold on.

2606
02:50:12,760 --> 02:50:13,360
It's here.

2607
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:15,340
Oh no.

2608
02:50:17,530 --> 02:50:18,129
That's bad.

2609
02:50:23,850 --> 02:50:24,750
I can't reset.

2610
02:50:24,750 --> 02:50:25,450
No, I can't.

2611
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:26,250
I've been doing it for too long.

2612
02:50:28,100 --> 02:50:33,059
That's why it these 20 by 20 is it just they take a lot of you

2613
02:50:33,059 --> 02:50:35,459
just have to remember you just can't just go fast.

2614
02:50:36,059 --> 02:50:36,459
That's all right.

2615
02:50:38,180 --> 02:50:38,979
Any more requests?

2616
02:50:42,319 --> 02:50:43,520
I'll take any requests by the way.

2617
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:45,819
It doesn't just have to be Miku long as it's not going to get the

2618
02:50:45,819 --> 02:50:46,520
channel turned off.

2619
02:50:49,729 --> 02:55:10,500
Like the world is mine made like 15 mistakes.

2620
02:55:14,780 --> 02:55:14,979
All right.

2621
02:55:14,979 --> 02:55:15,280
What was it?

2622
02:55:15,280 --> 02:55:15,479
What was it?

2623
02:55:15,479 --> 02:55:16,379
Somebody said I have a request.

2624
02:55:16,379 --> 02:55:16,780
What was it?

2625
02:55:23,709 --> 02:55:36,440
This one rolling girl, is it right?

2626
02:55:43,180 --> 02:55:44,479
How come these aren't in this game?

2627
02:55:47,809 --> 02:55:50,809
I don't want to miss you know, I don't want to misrepresent this

2628
02:55:50,809 --> 02:55:51,309
game.

2629
02:55:51,409 --> 02:55:52,510
This is these are not in the game.

2630
02:55:53,010 --> 02:55:54,110
I'm playing them on YouTube.

2631
02:55:55,329 --> 02:56:00,870
I wonder why would they wouldn't be in game probably licensing

2632
02:56:00,870 --> 02:56:01,370
problem.

2633
02:56:03,559 --> 02:56:05,840
I made this game.

2634
02:56:06,440 --> 02:56:10,440
Isn't it Sega doesn't Sega own this stuff who made this Sega

2635
02:56:10,440 --> 02:56:11,040
not make this?

2636
02:56:18,100 --> 02:56:18,700
Probably not.

2637
02:56:20,719 --> 02:56:21,319
That was fun.

2638
02:56:21,319 --> 02:56:24,590
I'm going to go back to some easier ones.

2639
02:56:26,229 --> 02:56:28,530
I want to least clear this second row here the second one.

2640
02:56:37,430 --> 02:56:38,729
Okay, how's the volume good?

2641
02:57:07,530 --> 02:57:12,100
I love when this happens, you know, it can't be anywhere over

2642
02:57:12,100 --> 02:57:12,399
here.

2643
02:57:13,299 --> 02:57:14,700
It helps free up a lot of space.

2644
02:57:15,700 --> 02:57:25,549
Usually 234 23.

2645
02:57:25,750 --> 02:57:25,950
All right.

2646
02:57:25,950 --> 02:57:28,149
Well, I mean, I know it's here and I know it's like here.

2647
02:57:52,239 --> 02:57:52,840
Like magnet.

2648
02:58:03,180 --> 02:58:04,479
I feel like I can get this.

2649
02:58:05,379 --> 02:58:05,680
Yeah.

2650
02:58:15,639 --> 02:58:17,840
Oh interesting one.

2651
02:58:36,430 --> 02:58:36,930
Huh?

2652
02:58:37,329 --> 02:58:39,440
Oh, I thought that was part of the

2653
02:58:39,940 --> 02:58:41,139
I just wasn't looking down shit.

2654
02:58:41,139 --> 02:58:41,440
Come on.

2655
02:58:41,440 --> 02:58:42,540
I can't make those kind of mistakes.

2656
02:58:42,540 --> 02:58:44,270
That's the rookie mistake.

2657
02:58:51,170 --> 02:58:51,670
This is different.

2658
02:59:06,510 --> 02:59:07,309
Oh, I already heard this one.

2659
02:59:11,729 --> 02:59:21,540
L polka polka was it live and polka.

2660
02:59:42,920 --> 02:59:44,120
Oh, it's this one.

2661
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:46,000
I know this one.

2662
02:59:46,100 --> 02:59:46,700
I know this one.

2663
02:59:56,350 --> 03:00:07,229
This is this is a classic song after I feel this wrong and

2664
03:00:07,229 --> 03:00:08,129
see what the special puzzle is.

2665
03:00:26,809 --> 03:00:27,809
Seven eight nine.

2666
03:00:28,790 --> 03:00:29,790
This I could do these two.

2667
03:00:32,979 --> 03:00:34,479
It's yes.

2668
03:00:42,590 --> 03:00:44,790
One two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2669
03:00:47,459 --> 03:00:48,559
Yo, what?

2670
03:00:49,860 --> 03:00:50,260
Yo.

2671
03:00:55,690 --> 03:00:56,790
So this is part of the three.

2672
03:00:56,790 --> 03:00:58,690
Then we know one, two, three.

2673
03:00:58,690 --> 03:00:59,889
It cannot be down here.

2674
03:01:08,579 --> 03:01:10,280
I mean, maybe it does a little because it's either it's either

2675
03:01:10,280 --> 03:01:13,479
one, two, three, four or it's here.

2676
03:01:13,879 --> 03:01:14,780
So I just go for it.

2677
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:17,819
I just go for it over here.

2678
03:01:18,819 --> 03:01:22,719
It's on it's either over here or it's right here.

2679
03:01:39,790 --> 03:01:40,290
I'm going for it.

2680
03:01:52,360 --> 03:01:53,760
You can call me a cheater if you want, but I got one.

2681
03:01:53,760 --> 03:02:11,239
I mean, what is this?

2682
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:15,620
What the hell is that?

2683
03:02:15,719 --> 03:02:16,219
This is different.

2684
03:02:16,319 --> 03:02:17,219
This is a different artist.

2685
03:02:24,049 --> 03:02:24,450
Play it.

2686
03:02:33,500 --> 03:02:33,799
Play it.

2687
03:02:33,799 --> 03:02:34,200
Play it.

2688
03:02:34,959 --> 03:02:35,459
Turn it off.

2689
03:02:35,760 --> 03:02:36,059
Play it.

2690
03:02:37,190 --> 03:02:40,629
This is called Kikuo.

2691
03:02:41,329 --> 03:02:42,629
Kikuo love me.

2692
03:02:42,829 --> 03:02:43,229
Love me.

2693
03:02:43,229 --> 03:02:43,729
Love me.

2694
03:02:44,530 --> 03:02:47,100
This is a different artist.

2695
03:03:08,100 --> 03:03:09,799
This actually helps because now it's one.

2696
03:03:20,680 --> 03:03:21,280
Don't tell him.

2697
03:03:24,049 --> 03:03:24,850
Play time machine.

2698
03:03:27,620 --> 03:03:28,319
Time machine.

2699
03:03:39,079 --> 03:03:39,979
I said fuck you.

2700
03:03:40,379 --> 03:03:40,780
What?

2701
03:03:51,229 --> 03:03:51,829
What the fuck?

2702
03:03:51,930 --> 03:03:52,329
What?

2703
03:03:55,370 --> 03:03:56,370
That was a bonus track.

2704
03:03:56,370 --> 03:03:57,569
We weren't supposed to even hear that one.

2705
03:04:22,680 --> 03:04:23,379
How do you do Donald Duck?

2706
03:04:27,280 --> 03:04:27,979
Something like that, right?

2707
03:04:27,979 --> 03:04:34,139
You go like I'm stumped.

2708
03:04:37,219 --> 03:04:38,219
It's definitely this row.

2709
03:04:38,620 --> 03:04:40,420
This row or this one has the most info.

2710
03:04:40,420 --> 03:04:41,719
One, two, three, four.

2711
03:04:42,520 --> 03:04:49,030
This is a one.

2712
03:04:49,030 --> 03:04:49,729
That's a one.

2713
03:04:49,729 --> 03:04:49,829
All right.

2714
03:04:49,829 --> 03:04:52,030
This is two after this.

2715
03:04:54,540 --> 03:04:55,840
Why is everyone so angry?

2716
03:04:56,440 --> 03:04:57,239
You're cringe.

2717
03:05:08,500 --> 03:05:09,399
You skipped a good song.

2718
03:05:09,500 --> 03:05:10,200
I didn't skip it.

2719
03:05:10,200 --> 03:05:11,200
We listened to half of it.

2720
03:05:29,579 --> 03:05:30,780
Go back, liar.

2721
03:05:30,879 --> 03:05:31,879
We listened to half of it.

2722
03:05:45,620 --> 03:05:46,719
I think this actually helps here.

2723
03:05:48,549 --> 03:05:48,950
It does.

2724
03:05:51,069 --> 03:05:52,069
Okay, so I can do that.

2725
03:05:52,870 --> 03:05:54,270
One, two, three, four, five.

2726
03:05:54,370 --> 03:05:55,670
One, two, three, four, five.

2727
03:05:55,670 --> 03:05:56,770
That's all I can do.

2728
03:05:57,469 --> 03:05:58,469
But this is three.

2729
03:06:01,239 --> 03:06:02,040
That's cool.

2730
03:06:03,680 --> 03:06:04,379
Helps a little.

2731
03:06:17,479 --> 03:06:18,379
I'm going to unfollow.

2732
03:06:18,979 --> 03:06:19,479
Why?

2733
03:06:19,479 --> 03:06:21,780
Because I skipped a song.

2734
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:24,600
Here, I'll put a streamer's choice on.

2735
03:07:00,459 --> 03:07:00,760
There.

2736
03:07:00,860 --> 03:07:02,159
I'll put a streamer's choice on for a bit.

2737
03:07:23,790 --> 03:07:27,209
Somebody said, bro, relax.

2738
03:07:41,250 --> 03:07:41,850
I'm going for it.

2739
03:07:42,329 --> 03:07:42,829
Yes.

2740
03:07:46,110 --> 03:07:46,909
This is the never video.

2741
03:08:13,180 --> 03:08:14,079
This actually goes.

2742
03:08:14,180 --> 03:08:14,780
It does, yeah.

2743
03:08:16,319 --> 03:08:17,920
This way, I'm going to, we'll keep this on for a little bit.

2744
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:20,319
Those of you that have not heard this before, it's a great soundtrack.

2745
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:23,659
It's by Terry Scott Taylor.

2746
03:08:39,579 --> 03:08:40,079
Pretty good.

2747
03:08:41,379 --> 03:08:42,379
Really nostalgic.

2748
03:08:42,579 --> 03:08:43,579
Nostalgic.

2749
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:44,280
Can't even say it.

2750
03:08:45,420 --> 03:08:46,719
Now we turn this up, of course.

2751
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:48,420
Oh, you don't think we're going to turn this up all the way?

2752
03:09:20,620 --> 03:09:21,819
This is not Miku.

2753
03:09:26,030 --> 03:09:27,129
Yeah, I'm playing.

2754
03:09:27,129 --> 03:09:28,829
Oh, yeah, it's Hatsune Miku.

2755
03:09:28,829 --> 03:09:30,629
The game where you do Picross.

2756
03:09:30,930 --> 03:09:33,129
Of course, the soundtrack is going to be very important.

2757
03:09:34,389 --> 03:09:35,590
This is incredibly important.

2758
03:09:48,909 --> 03:09:49,209
Let me see.

2759
03:09:49,209 --> 03:09:50,110
What should I put on?

2760
03:09:53,860 --> 03:09:55,260
Oh, yeah, this one.

2761
03:09:59,879 --> 03:10:00,280
Let's go.

2762
03:10:11,700 --> 03:10:12,200
This way.

2763
03:10:18,020 --> 03:10:20,120
Dude, this guy fucking loves the saxophone.

2764
03:10:27,469 --> 03:10:28,170
It's great.

2765
03:10:31,260 --> 03:10:32,260
This whole game has a vibe.

2766
03:10:41,860 --> 03:10:42,659
This one's tricky.

2767
03:10:46,989 --> 03:10:48,389
I feel like it kind of has to wait.

2768
03:10:49,389 --> 03:10:50,090
I don't know.

2769
03:10:51,219 --> 03:10:53,250
I really don't know.

2770
03:10:53,450 --> 03:10:54,049
I know that.

2771
03:11:06,790 --> 03:11:07,090
Yeah.

2772
03:11:07,090 --> 03:11:08,290
Hey, why don't you fucking take it?

2773
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:09,459
Sit down for this one.

2774
03:11:11,079 --> 03:11:11,879
Sit down for this one.

2775
03:11:13,590 --> 03:11:15,190
This one goes super hard.

2776
03:11:35,280 --> 03:11:35,879
This dude loves...

2777
03:11:35,879 --> 03:11:36,379
I do.

2778
03:11:36,479 --> 03:11:36,780
All right.

2779
03:11:36,780 --> 03:11:38,680
I like the saxophone.

2780
03:11:38,780 --> 03:11:39,479
It's a fucking...

2781
03:11:39,680 --> 03:11:41,180
It's an unbelievable instrument.

2782
03:11:44,659 --> 03:11:45,459
And plus it's like...

2783
03:11:45,860 --> 03:11:46,159
What do you mean?

2784
03:11:46,159 --> 03:11:46,959
It's an oboe.

2785
03:11:48,260 --> 03:11:49,159
This is an oboe.

2786
03:12:20,559 --> 03:12:23,059
Oh, now it's just cascades.

2787
03:12:23,659 --> 03:12:53,420
All right.

2788
03:12:53,420 --> 03:12:54,719
Now we bring everything together.

2789
03:12:55,219 --> 03:12:55,920
Here we go.

2790
03:13:15,899 --> 03:13:16,600
This goes hard.

2791
03:13:16,600 --> 03:13:17,399
Of course it does.

2792
03:13:20,610 --> 03:13:21,510
This whole soundtrack is...

2793
03:13:22,110 --> 03:13:24,809
This is the best soundtrack of any video game that is ever released.

2794
03:13:25,649 --> 03:13:26,649
I genuinely mean that.

2795
03:13:26,649 --> 03:13:27,450
I really believe that.

2796
03:13:34,129 --> 03:13:35,129
See how you guys feel about this one.

2797
03:13:38,020 --> 03:13:39,219
This one's a great one.

2798
03:13:39,219 --> 03:13:40,219
You guys are going to love this one.

2799
03:13:56,569 --> 03:13:57,870
This one's pretty topical today.

2800
03:14:00,559 --> 03:14:00,860
What is this?

2801
03:14:00,860 --> 03:14:02,159
This is the Neverhood soundtrack.

2802
03:14:03,159 --> 03:14:04,659
The OST for the Neverhood.

2803
03:14:05,059 --> 03:14:06,059
By Terry Scott Tello.

2804
03:14:39,260 --> 03:14:41,159
This is the shit that would play when you were doing a puzzle.

2805
03:14:42,180 --> 03:14:43,379
They just added to the whole thing.

2806
03:14:49,579 --> 03:14:49,879
Are you going to...

2807
03:14:49,879 --> 03:14:50,379
Yeah.

2808
03:14:53,709 --> 03:14:56,409
Is this what you play when you play your iPad games?

2809
03:15:00,159 --> 03:15:00,959
Oh, this one's good too.

2810
03:15:06,209 --> 03:15:06,909
This one's really good.

2811
03:15:29,979 --> 03:15:30,479
What?

2812
03:15:30,479 --> 03:15:31,180
Oh, fuck.

2813
03:15:37,620 --> 03:15:39,319
This chill Thanksgiving vibes.

2814
03:15:39,319 --> 03:15:39,719
Come on.

2815
03:15:40,020 --> 03:16:10,639
That's the three, right?

2816
03:16:10,940 --> 03:16:11,840
No, it's the four.

2817
03:16:13,629 --> 03:16:15,329
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

2818
03:16:23,639 --> 03:16:24,239
What else we got?

2819
03:16:32,319 --> 03:16:33,520
Do I have to play the...

2820
03:16:33,620 --> 03:16:33,920
Come on.

2821
03:16:33,920 --> 03:16:35,319
I do this like every like a year or two.

2822
03:16:39,860 --> 03:16:41,860
In the sequel to the Neverhood, there was a...

2823
03:16:42,159 --> 03:16:42,959
It was a bonus room.

2824
03:16:42,959 --> 03:16:43,959
It was called Skullmonkeys.

2825
03:16:44,540 --> 03:16:53,600
So there was a bonus room in the sequel to the Neverhood where you go in it and they sing you a song.

2826
03:16:56,219 --> 03:16:58,219
And this is the song that plays when you're in the bonus room.

2827
03:16:59,059 --> 03:17:02,459
It's been the inspiration for a lot of music in the video game world.

2828
03:17:03,159 --> 03:17:04,959
If you didn't know, look it up.

2829
03:17:06,579 --> 03:17:06,979
Here it is.

2830
03:17:30,510 --> 03:17:31,409
You don't.

2831
03:18:01,629 --> 03:18:05,450
And a little like your mom.

2832
03:18:05,549 --> 03:18:08,350
There are no monsters here.

2833
03:18:08,450 --> 03:18:10,950
Hey, wait, look over there.

2834
03:18:13,549 --> 03:18:15,350
I was just kidding.

2835
03:18:17,399 --> 03:18:18,600
Be scared.

2836
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:30,399
And when you turn this game off in the real world once again, you won't have to play Make Me Leave, but try to pretend.

2837
03:18:30,899 --> 03:18:35,399
Because I'll be right there when you open your...

2838
03:18:35,500 --> 03:18:36,000
Is this too loud?

2839
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:36,799
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

2840
03:18:36,799 --> 03:18:41,700
Because I'm your little invisible musical friend.

2841
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:47,500
So show me to your pets or show me to your pals.

2842
03:18:47,899 --> 03:18:53,100
You really will impress every nifty guy and gal.

2843
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:55,700
Show them you're individual.

2844
03:18:56,200 --> 03:18:58,500
Show them you are bold.

2845
03:18:58,899 --> 03:19:05,299
Besides, I get residuals for every game that's sold.

2846
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:12,500
I'm your little invisible musical friend.

2847
03:19:14,520 --> 03:19:17,319
Somebody said when Jerma gets the aux cord.

2848
03:19:22,239 --> 03:19:26,840
So that plays when you're in a bonus and it was funny and it was like weird and people thought it was like, what the fuck is happening?

2849
03:19:26,840 --> 03:19:28,040
It was like a secret room.

2850
03:19:31,440 --> 03:19:31,840
There you go.

2851
03:19:35,200 --> 03:19:36,500
All right, we're doing streamers choice again.

2852
03:19:40,120 --> 03:19:41,520
What should I play for streamers choice?

2853
03:19:53,440 --> 03:19:53,840
I got one.

2854
03:19:59,020 --> 03:19:59,520
This is a good one.

2855
03:20:03,719 --> 03:20:05,120
I don't think people are going to be upset about this one.

2856
03:20:29,100 --> 03:20:30,200
All right, I got to pay attention now.

2857
03:20:30,399 --> 03:20:31,860
So three could be here.

2858
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:34,920
It's probably there and it is.

2859
03:20:38,969 --> 03:20:42,670
Now the real question is there is a two and a one hanging out here.

2860
03:20:42,670 --> 03:20:43,569
There's also a three.

2861
03:20:47,979 --> 03:20:49,280
Ah, I took a guess.

2862
03:20:49,280 --> 03:20:50,280
I just wanted to get it done.

2863
03:20:52,020 --> 03:20:54,120
If I had put the marker there, I wouldn't know it wasn't there.

2864
03:20:58,299 --> 03:20:59,100
That's three strikes.

2865
03:20:59,200 --> 03:20:59,600
Shit.

2866
03:21:01,719 --> 03:21:06,420
This is Superstar Saga the battle music or the Game Boy Advance, I believe.

2867
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:37,360
One, two, yoko Shimomura.

2868
03:21:37,360 --> 03:21:42,569
Yep, I think Yoko Shimomura might be probably one of the best.

2869
03:21:43,579 --> 03:21:46,680
I think the best that ever was.

2870
03:21:46,680 --> 03:21:54,360
I think so many soundtracks by Yoko Shimomura were, I mean, they're just unbeatable.

2871
03:21:56,469 --> 03:22:00,069
I don't understand how it's possible to have that many 10 out of 10

2872
03:22:00,069 --> 03:22:02,670
soundtracks in a row every time.

2873
03:22:05,190 --> 03:22:11,389
I don't understand because it's not just one or two.

2874
03:22:12,190 --> 03:22:13,690
It's all of them.

2875
03:22:14,680 --> 03:22:15,979
Every single one of them.

2876
03:22:19,870 --> 03:22:24,049
Being that talented and being that connected to music and stuff.

2877
03:22:24,049 --> 03:22:25,549
It's just, it's just unbelievable.

2878
03:22:25,549 --> 03:22:26,049
It really is.

2879
03:22:35,819 --> 03:22:37,120
Redditor music taste?

2880
03:22:37,819 --> 03:22:38,719
I don't know.

2881
03:22:39,719 --> 03:22:40,420
I could, all right.

2882
03:22:40,420 --> 03:22:41,219
That's bait.

2883
03:22:41,860 --> 03:22:43,159
That's bait I was about to take.

2884
03:22:43,159 --> 03:22:44,959
I was about to just eat the onion there.

2885
03:22:46,139 --> 03:22:46,940
I was about to eat the onion.

2886
03:22:47,340 --> 03:22:47,639
All right.

2887
03:22:47,739 --> 03:22:48,239
Nevermind.

2888
03:22:50,620 --> 03:22:50,920
All right.

2889
03:22:50,920 --> 03:22:51,420
Chat's choice.

2890
03:22:51,420 --> 03:22:51,819
What do you want?

2891
03:22:58,569 --> 03:22:59,069
Chat's choice.

2892
03:23:02,620 --> 03:23:03,219
Will Miku?

2893
03:23:03,219 --> 03:23:03,420
All right.

2894
03:23:03,420 --> 03:23:04,219
Well, give me a Miku song.

2895
03:23:13,959 --> 03:23:14,459
Magnet.

2896
03:23:14,459 --> 03:23:14,860
That was one.

2897
03:23:14,860 --> 03:23:16,059
Yeah, I remember seeing that earlier.

2898
03:23:16,959 --> 03:23:17,459
Magnet.

2899
03:23:27,360 --> 03:23:27,860
Is this correct?

2900
03:27:25,510 --> 03:27:25,610
All right.

2901
03:27:25,610 --> 03:27:28,110
What's some other music that I want to show you?

2902
03:27:39,399 --> 03:27:39,899
Hmm.

2903
03:27:41,879 --> 03:27:42,579
Do more Neverhood.

2904
03:27:53,379 --> 03:27:58,850
I was going to play the Avengers theme because I wanted to have the mods.

2905
03:27:58,850 --> 03:28:01,450
I was going to say in private to count how many bad chest there were.

2906
03:28:04,299 --> 03:28:07,079
People already started doing it, but my joke is ruined.

2907
03:28:07,579 --> 03:28:08,180
What should I play?

2908
03:28:16,309 --> 03:28:17,010
I guess we're doing this.

2909
03:28:29,850 --> 03:28:30,950
I feel like it's right here.

2910
03:28:31,149 --> 03:28:31,450
Yeah.

2911
03:28:35,549 --> 03:28:36,350
One, two, three.

2912
03:28:36,350 --> 03:28:37,350
One, two, three.

2913
03:28:48,920 --> 03:28:49,920
My favorite gorilla song.

2914
03:28:50,020 --> 03:28:51,420
Um, it used to be Stylo.

2915
03:29:05,059 --> 03:29:05,860
Stylo is...

2916
03:29:06,459 --> 03:29:07,159
I just like the beat.

2917
03:29:21,920 --> 03:29:22,719
Stylo slaps.

2918
03:29:22,719 --> 03:29:22,920
Yeah.

2919
03:29:22,920 --> 03:29:23,620
I'll put it on after this.

2920
03:29:25,989 --> 03:29:27,090
You guys get mad if I put it on now.

2921
03:29:34,750 --> 03:29:37,350
This stream is definitely not going to be up anymore.

2922
03:29:37,450 --> 03:29:39,149
It's going to get dropped in a second.

2923
03:29:46,110 --> 03:29:46,309
Bye.

2924
03:29:46,309 --> 03:29:47,010
Happy Thanksgiving.

2925
03:29:47,110 --> 03:29:47,610
Happy Thanksgiving.

2926
03:29:47,610 --> 03:29:48,010
Thanks for coming.

2927
03:29:49,159 --> 03:29:49,760
Thanks for chilling.

2928
03:29:53,260 --> 03:29:56,360
And again, like I said before, I want to start doing more of these

2929
03:29:56,760 --> 03:29:57,860
streams that we just kind of chilled.

2930
03:29:58,659 --> 03:29:59,260
Put on some music.

2931
03:30:00,850 --> 03:30:02,450
Do something just simple.

2932
03:30:03,250 --> 03:30:03,850
Hang out for a little bit.

2933
03:30:09,149 --> 03:30:09,950
I like these a lot.

2934
03:30:25,170 --> 03:30:25,569
Does this help?

2935
03:30:25,770 --> 03:30:25,969
Good.

2936
03:30:28,350 --> 03:30:29,049
Talk about spaghetti.

2937
03:30:29,750 --> 03:30:30,450
I love spaghetti.

2938
03:30:48,780 --> 03:30:49,479
Okay, good.

2939
03:30:56,459 --> 03:30:57,260
This is also six.

2940
03:30:57,260 --> 03:30:57,659
Hold on.

2941
03:31:06,149 --> 03:31:06,750
That's okay.

2942
03:31:22,350 --> 03:31:23,450
One, two, three, four.

2943
03:31:26,170 --> 03:31:26,870
Two.

2944
03:31:28,040 --> 03:31:29,639
One, two, four.

2945
03:31:29,639 --> 03:31:30,639
One, two, three, four.

2946
03:31:43,299 --> 03:31:43,899
Six.

2947
03:31:44,299 --> 03:31:45,000
Is this six here?

2948
03:31:45,000 --> 03:31:45,299
Yep.

2949
03:31:54,079 --> 03:31:54,479
Sweet.

2950
03:31:58,520 --> 03:31:58,819
All right.

2951
03:31:58,920 --> 03:31:59,319
No mistakes.

2952
03:31:59,319 --> 03:31:59,620
Good.

2953
03:32:00,600 --> 03:32:01,200
That's what I like to see.

2954
03:32:13,889 --> 03:32:14,190
All right.

2955
03:32:14,389 --> 03:32:14,790
What's it going to do?

2956
03:32:14,790 --> 03:32:15,190
Oh, yes.

2957
03:32:15,190 --> 03:32:15,590
Stylo.

2958
03:32:22,129 --> 03:32:22,629
It's almost over.

2959
03:32:22,629 --> 03:32:23,329
I won't stop it.

2960
03:32:25,930 --> 03:32:26,430
It's almost over.

2961
03:32:44,610 --> 03:32:45,010
Here we go.

2962
03:32:47,920 --> 03:32:50,219
This is one of my favorite songs on the album.

2963
03:32:51,120 --> 03:32:52,620
This thing is, this is sick.

2964
03:37:16,760 --> 03:37:17,260
No, I was typing.

2965
03:37:17,260 --> 03:37:18,559
Do you hear how fast I was typing?

2966
03:37:18,559 --> 03:37:19,459
What just happened?

2967
03:37:19,459 --> 03:37:20,459
I typed three words.

2968
03:37:22,190 --> 03:37:23,489
I typed three words.

2969
03:37:23,489 --> 03:37:24,590
Why did that take so long?

2970
03:37:25,379 --> 03:37:26,780
Oh, we keep this one on too, by the way.

2971
03:37:30,899 --> 03:41:13,079
But if you guys like these, you know, start streaming around like

2972
03:41:13,479 --> 03:41:14,579
six or seven p.m.

2973
03:41:14,579 --> 03:41:15,079
Pacific.

2974
03:41:15,709 --> 03:41:16,809
Stream for a few hours.

2975
03:41:16,909 --> 03:41:17,709
Do it every so often.

2976
03:41:20,430 --> 03:41:21,430
A little bit lower energy.

2977
03:41:22,329 --> 03:41:22,829
Hang out.

2978
03:41:23,370 --> 03:41:24,670
I actually like it a lot.

2979
03:41:28,930 --> 03:41:32,030
Now, there were some high-energy moments today, but that's just the way it is.

2980
03:41:32,430 --> 03:41:33,729
I can't stop that.

2981
03:41:35,620 --> 03:41:37,819
What's the ultimate Miku song to play right now?

2982
03:41:48,209 --> 03:41:49,209
The Miku song?

2983
03:41:54,590 --> 03:41:56,090
Intense voice.

2984
03:42:01,049 --> 03:42:01,350
Okay.

2985
03:42:24,809 --> 03:42:25,510
I already did this one.

2986
03:42:26,209 --> 03:42:26,510
Today?

2987
03:42:38,940 --> 03:42:39,440
I don't think so.

2988
03:42:42,030 --> 03:42:43,430
What's the one where, uh...

2989
03:42:49,270 --> 03:42:49,969
What's the one that...

2990
03:42:52,860 --> 03:42:53,459
I forget what it was.

2991
03:42:55,799 --> 03:42:56,200
Play...

2992
03:42:56,500 --> 03:42:57,000
Ma...

2993
03:42:57,600 --> 03:42:58,100
I'll play that one now.

2994
03:42:58,799 --> 03:42:59,399
We'll do two more.

2995
03:43:00,200 --> 03:43:01,000
Don't worry, we're queuing it up.

2996
03:43:08,930 --> 03:43:10,329
I got, we got time for two more.

2997
03:43:22,379 --> 03:43:23,680
One, two, three, okay.

2998
03:43:28,559 --> 03:43:29,159
Then nine, ten.

2999
03:43:37,200 --> 03:43:38,100
What's the other one that's like this?

3000
03:43:39,729 --> 03:43:40,229
It's like

3001
03:43:50,430 --> 03:43:50,930
Yeah, it's like

3002
03:43:59,899 --> 03:44:00,700
All right, this one's a little...

3003
03:44:01,100 --> 03:44:01,799
This one's crazy.

3004
03:44:16,459 --> 03:44:17,459
Wrench in, wrench in now.

3005
03:44:17,959 --> 03:44:18,420
All right.

3006
03:44:31,809 --> 03:44:33,069
Oh my God.

3007
03:44:36,059 --> 03:44:44,469
Okay.

3008
03:44:44,610 --> 03:45:30,569
This is the one?

3009
03:45:30,709 --> 03:45:31,110
That one's, uh...

3010
03:45:31,110 --> 03:45:31,809
That one's a little much.

3011
03:45:32,209 --> 03:45:32,770
That one's crazy.

3012
03:45:33,379 --> 03:45:33,780
Um...

3013
03:45:34,909 --> 03:45:35,770
I just wanted to hear the beginning.

3014
03:45:35,770 --> 03:45:42,139
Just wanted to hear the very beginning. That's all I wanted to hear. All right. We need we need one to go out on

3015
03:45:42,139 --> 03:46:43,750
I got one to go out on. How about this one? What do you think? Should we play it again?

3016
03:46:43,790 --> 03:47:10,860
Give me just something random. Give me something random. There's something that's just completely out of left field peaches

3017
03:47:11,340 --> 03:47:20,260
Wow, holy smokes. Wow that you just brought back me

3018
03:47:20,260 --> 03:47:29,899
You just brought me back like 15 years really Wow. I

3019
03:47:32,540 --> 03:47:34,540
Completely forgot about this song and this band

3020
03:47:35,219 --> 03:47:40,979
Alright, let's get out of with this one

3021
03:47:53,670 --> 03:47:56,299
Then it goes look out

3022
03:48:19,129 --> 03:48:25,520
I'm moving to the country. I'm going to eat a lot of peaches

3023
03:48:26,399 --> 03:48:30,559
Moving to the country. I'm going to eat a lot of peaches

3024
03:48:31,399 --> 03:48:35,280
Moving to the country. I'm going to eat a lot of peaches

3025
03:48:36,040 --> 03:48:38,040
Something's done here

3026
03:48:47,909 --> 03:48:49,909
Can't be here

3027
03:48:55,270 --> 03:49:07,219
Is that millions of peaches peaches for free

3028
03:49:29,860 --> 03:49:31,860
That

3029
03:49:32,139 --> 03:50:14,700
This was a D song back in the day they're like fighting in this music video. Well, this is why I don't know

3030
03:50:14,700 --> 03:50:38,940
We're not doing this one. I don't know about this one. Cool. All right. I'm already doing it

3031
03:50:38,940 --> 03:50:59,819
So I'm already doing it. So what we knew one more. All right. Let me play the one that everyone's been requesting

3032
03:50:59,819 --> 03:51:14,299
It's what's it called. It's called like my Marta. What is it? It's going too fast Mar

3033
03:51:14,940 --> 03:51:16,409

3034
03:51:16,409 --> 03:51:37,399
Mart you're okay this one. All right this one is this correct?

3035

Yes. Yeah. All right. All right. We'll go out on this one. I'll try to get this puzzle on quick

3036
03:51:47,959 --> 03:52:31,770

3045
03:54:43,209 --> 03:54:56,840
It is getting faster. Any more special requests? We got room for maybe one or two more

3046
03:54:56,840 --> 03:55:21,819
Maybe just a Kaizen opening. We can start doing anime openings now

3047
03:55:26,100 --> 03:55:42,809
All right. Here we go. What's your favorite anime opening? Let's play them all

3050
03:56:22,389 --> 03:56:29,709
Oh my god, I know this. Yep. Oh, yeah, I've seen it. All right, let's go back

3051
03:56:48,739 --> 03:57:10,940
We're getting stuck

3052
03:57:17,450 --> 03:57:24,110
Got it. All right, what are the what are the anime intros do you guys want to hear?

Any more anime intros? What else you got? I got one for you. My it's dreamy's choice. There you go

3054
03:58:17,690 --> 03:58:19,690

03:58:22,209 --> 03:58:24,700
That's part

3056
03:59:02,530 --> 03:59:12,579
You're punching me and you're doing bad chest I

3057
03:59:13,260 --> 03:59:18,389
Got I get one anime a year. I actually think I've watched any this year

3058
03:59:18,389 --> 03:59:35,969
I watched I watched one anime a year. Is there anything that I should watch chainsaw, man, but I like chainsaw, man

3059
03:59:36,090 --> 03:59:46,790
Yeah, I mean, I don't yeah animes are right. Like I don't hate it

3060
03:59:46,790 --> 03:59:53,750
I don't watch that much of it. That's why I have my I have my one anime that I watch a year

3061
03:59:53,790 --> 04:00:06,670
Well, I somehow I love some animes mob psycho is good

3062
04:00:06,829 --> 04:00:11,790
All right, if you were to pick between mob psycho and chainsaw, man

3063
04:00:12,110 --> 04:00:24,159
We get a poll in the chat, please Bob psycho or chainsaw, man, what would you watch Bob psycho 100% really? Okay

3064
04:00:24,280 --> 04:00:41,479
You would probably like mob psycho better. All right, this is getting weird here. So I'm one two three three

3065
04:00:42,979 --> 04:00:53,209
Are you no, I'm not high chainsaw man is I missed what you said mob psycho is a masterpiece

3066
04:00:53,209 --> 04:00:58,549
I don't okay. You need to close the poll. We don't need to have it open anymore

3067
04:00:59,149 --> 04:01:07,700
Almost that's a very very strong decision. All right, I'm almost done with this. So where are we?

3068
04:01:07,860 --> 04:01:12,549
How do I not have all ten of these one two five six seven eight nine

3069
04:01:12,549 --> 04:01:24,680
I don't want to guess but I know that's there but I mean that there's 80%

3070
04:01:25,239 --> 04:01:32,579
Okay, I got a shave bad. All right one final song to take us out a one final

3071
04:01:33,100 --> 04:01:55,389
Anime intro. What do you want do the mob psycho intro? No, I don't want to walk

3072
04:01:55,389 --> 04:02:01,219
okay, I don't want to watch the mob psycho intro right now because I want to watch it when I'm sitting on the couch and

3073
04:02:02,409 --> 04:02:03,729
You know it gets to that part

3074
04:02:03,729 --> 04:02:08,850
Your favorite part where like something cool is happening a really beautifully animated sequence and it hits that drop of the song and you

3075
04:02:08,850 --> 04:02:12,450
Just like you feel like warm and you're just like here it comes. Yes. There it is

3076
04:02:12,450 --> 04:02:19,799
That's what I like and then you rewind the YouTube video of the intro

3077
04:02:22,549 --> 04:02:29,969
Okay, let me ask you a question and I want everyone to be real be real with me. Don't lie. Don't make it up

3078
04:02:29,969 --> 04:02:36,370
I want I want to know if you do this. Are you ready? I'm just I don't have to say anything

3079
04:02:36,370 --> 04:02:39,979
I'm just gonna do it and I want you to just observe

3080
04:02:39,979 --> 04:02:42,959
Let's take the one punch man intro for an example

3081
04:03:33,270 --> 04:03:36,340
Oh

3082
04:04:10,600 --> 04:04:12,840
Am I a weirdo am I a weirdo

3083
04:04:13,559 --> 04:04:16,250
Oh

3084
04:04:25,180 --> 04:04:29,840
All right, you get it you get the idea you get the idea you get the idea you get the idea

3085
04:04:51,920 --> 04:05:25,149
Alright so what's the last song for real because I'm about to finish the puzzle it's almost over Pokemon Colosseum music, okay

3086
04:05:39,450 --> 04:05:41,530
I don't know why I muted it. I like this

3087
04:05:44,600 --> 04:05:46,600
Why is it muting? Stop muting

3088
04:05:46,600 --> 04:06:42,030
Okay. All right. This is good shit. All right. What is this? Oh

3089
04:06:45,850 --> 04:06:49,049
I think you make a huge picture with all this. That's cool

3090
04:06:49,770 --> 04:07:15,659
That's I like that. All right, one more. All right people seem to do this one. This is called Anamanaguchi

3091
04:07:17,020 --> 04:07:47,290
Let's take a look at all the artwork a sea of people asking for bloody stream and kickback

3092
04:07:47,290 --> 04:07:54,350
And he picks the one dude who wanted the Pokemon salsa song. I thought it was interesting

3093
04:07:54,389 --> 04:11:20,889
I wanted to play it. That's pretty cool. You guys have fun. That was chill. I very much enjoyed this dream

3094
04:11:20,889 --> 04:11:25,569
I hope you did too and again, happy Thanksgiving. Those either celebrate it. Hope you had a good one. I

3095
04:11:28,459 --> 04:11:32,139
Will see you guys the next stream. I I got some sponsored stuff to do on

3096
04:11:33,500 --> 04:11:37,280
Saturday we're going to be playing

3097
04:11:38,040 --> 04:11:42,680
Darktide I've seen a lot about it. It looks really fun

3098
04:11:44,270 --> 04:11:51,620
Vermintide was really cool. So actually excited really excited to play it. I'm gonna play Darktide. I'm gonna try to get some

3099
04:11:53,049 --> 04:11:58,860
Friends some friendos to play it. So I think it's a four-player co-op. I heard it at Darktide rocks

3100
04:11:58,860 --> 04:12:03,260
I heard it's really good. Yeah, I'm very interested in playing it and it's gonna be sponsors. That's cool

3101
04:12:04,270 --> 04:12:08,459
But I'm gonna try to find a group. I'm already talking to some people should be fun

3102
04:12:08,540 --> 04:12:14,819
That's on Saturday the 26th and then I don't know Sunday Monday

3103
04:12:14,819 --> 04:12:25,190
We'll figure the rest out but I will see you guys on Saturday. Take care of yourselves again. Happy Thanksgiving

3104
04:12:25,430 --> 04:12:37,940
That was Miku Picross actually really good Picross. It's a little bit more beginner-friendly

3105
04:12:37,940 --> 04:12:42,719
I think which is a good thing if you never played it before and if you like Miku then I mean obviously it's there

3106
04:12:42,979 --> 04:12:56,200
Appreciate it for hanging out. I'll see you guys soon. So Saturday stream will start probably around

3107
04:12:56,799 --> 04:13:01,579
230 Pacific I want to say around between 2 and 230

3108
04:13:01,579 --> 04:13:06,579
I'd say 230 Pacific is probably a safe place to put it. Is the VOD ever gonna get uploaded?

3109
04:13:06,579 --> 04:13:19,700
Ah, that's a great question. I would just check in like 10 minutes. See if it's even there expect more of these though

3110
04:13:19,780 --> 04:13:27,489
Where we just kind of hang out I open up something a little more chill and we just play it and just do whatever

3111
04:13:27,569 --> 04:13:40,209
See you guys Saturday. Yeah, Breath of the Wild is like that too

3112
04:13:40,209 --> 04:13:46,309
It is although I I can get a little high energy on those streams just because not very good

3113
04:13:46,469 --> 04:14:04,610
It's still fun and I'm gonna go when I'm gonna go probably take a bath tonight. Maybe we think take a bath

3114
04:14:04,610 --> 04:14:16,610
I think I'm out. Happy Thanksgiving. See you later. Good night everybody call your mother
